Abstract
Glucose deprivation has been hypothesized to cause cytotoxicity by inducing metabolic oxidative stress in human cancer
cells. The current work tests the hypothesis that 2-deoxy-Dglucose (2DG) combined with cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)] can enhance cytotoxicity in human head and
neck cancer cells (FaDu) by mechanisms involving oxidative
stress. Exposure of FaDu cells to the combination of 2DG and
cisplatin resulted in a significant decrease in cell survival when
compared with 2DG or cisplatin alone. Treatment with 2DG
and cisplatin also caused perturbations in parameters indicative of oxidative stress, including decreased intracellular total
glutathione and increased percentage of glutathione disulfide.
Simultaneous treatment with the thiol antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited parameters indicative of oxidative
stress, as well as protected FaDu cells from the cytotoxic
effects of cisplatin alone and the combination of 2DG and
cisplatin. In addition, polyethylene glycol–conjugated antioxidant enzymes (PEG-superoxide dismutase and PEG-catalase)
also protected FaDu cells from 2DG toxicity. An inhibitor
of glutathione synthesis, L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO),
sensitized FaDu cells to the cytotoxic effects of 2DG and
cisplatin, and these effects were inhibited by NAC. Furthermore, the combination of 2DG, cisplatin, and BSO significantly
increased the percentage of glutathione disulfide, which
was also inhibited by NAC. These results support the
hypothesis that exposure of human head and neck cancer cells
to 2DG combined with cisplatin enhances cytotoxicity via
metabolic oxidative stress. These findings provide a strong
biochemical rationale for evaluating inhibitors of glucose
and hydroperoxide metabolism in combination with cisplatin
for the treatment of head and neck cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Neoplastic transformed cells (cancer cells) show altered
metabolism when compared with untransformed (normal) cells
(1–4), and the metabolic disruptions seem to involve increased
metabolism of glucose and the loss of regulation between glycolytic
metabolism and respiration (1–4). In general, cancer cells have

increased rates of glycolysis as well as pentose phosphate cycle
activity, and slightly reduced rates of respiration (1–4). Accordingly,
cancer cells have been hypothesized to compensate for a proposed
‘‘defect’’ in respiration by increasing glycolysis (1) but the
mechanisms responsible for these metabolic perturbations remain
obscure.
Several studies have shown that glucose deprivation induces
oxidative stress in human cancer cells and this effect seems to be
more pronounced in transformed versus normal cells (5–7). In
addition, increased pro-oxidant production and profound disruptions in thiol metabolism consistent with metabolic oxidative
stress were also noted in cancer cells during glucose deprivation
or when treated with the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-D-glucose
(2DG; refs. 5–10). Glucose deprivation or 2DG-induced cytotoxicity and increases in parameters indicative of oxidative stress
have also been shown to be inhibited by the thiol antioxidant Nacetylcysteine (NAC; refs. 5, 6, 10), as well as overexpression of
enzymes that scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as
superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (9). These results have led to
the hypothesis that metabolic oxidative stress caused by ROS is
causally related to the effects of glucose deprivation in transformed cells.
Cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)] is an effective
antitumor agent and is one of the most widely used drugs either
alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents or
with radiotherapy in the management of locally advanced or
recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (11).
DNA is believed to be the major critical target of cisplatin-induced
toxicity, and efficacy is believed to be a function of cisplatin-DNA
adducts inhibiting DNA replication and transcription, ultimately
resulting in cell death (12). Several recent studies have shown that
the cytotoxicity of cisplatin may also be related to the inhibition of
thioredoxin reductase activity (13–15), which participates in
important cellular defense systems that protect against oxidative
stress induced by hydroperoxides in cancer cells (16, 17). In
addition, the reduced efficacy of cisplatin is often observed in cells
with increased glutathione levels, which represents another major
thiol antioxidant defense (18). Modulation of intracellular thiol
levels has been shown to influence cisplatin cytotoxicity in
numerous studies, and cisplatin has been hypothesized to cause
oxidative stress (19, 20).
Because the glucose analogue 2DG is a clinically relevant
inhibitor of glucose metabolism believed to mimic the effects of
glucose deprivation (21, 22), we hypothesized that 2DG in
combination with cisplatin may act to inhibit critical aspects of
thiol-mediated hydroperoxide metabolism leading to increased
steady-state levels of ROS and enhanced tumor cell killing via
metabolic oxidative stress. The current experiments were designed

to test the aforementioned hypothesis using human head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma cells. We predicted that the combination
of 2DG and cisplatin would have an additive and possibly synergistic effect on clonogenic cell killing in FaDu human head and neck
squamous carcinoma cells by enhancing metabolic oxidative stress.
The results indicate that treatment of human head and neck
carcinoma cells (FaDu) with 2DG and cisplatin causes a decrease in
total glutathione content = [reduced glutathione (GSH) + glutathione disulfide (GSSG)], an increase in percentage of GSSG, as well
as enhanced cytotoxicity. Both the disruptions in thiol metabolism
and the cytotoxicity induced by exposure to the combination of
2DG and cisplatin were reversed by treatment with the thiol
antioxidant NAC. Finally, the cytotoxicity and oxidative stress
induced by the combination of 2DG and cisplatin were significantly
enhanced by the GSH-depleting agent L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO), and this effect was also inhibited by NAC. These
results provide strong support for the hypothesis that the
combination of 2DG and cisplatin enhances cytotoxicity in human
head and neck cancer cells via metabolic oxidative stress. These
results also suggest a clear biochemical rationale for combining
inhibitors of glucose and hydroperoxide metabolism for the
enhancement of the anticancer effects of cisplatin in human head
and neck cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cells and culture conditions. FaDu human head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM containing 4 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, and
4.5 g/L glucose with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT).
Cultures were maintained in 5% CO2 and humidified in a 37jC incubator.
Drug treatment. 2DG, NAC, cisplatin, BSO, polyethylene glycol (PEG)CuZn superoxide dismutase (SOD), and PEG-catalase were obtained from
Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). PEG was obtained from Fisher
Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). All drugs were used without further purification.
Drugs were added to cells at a final concentration of 20 mmol/L 2DG,
0.5 Amol/L cisplatin, 15 mmol/L NAC, 1.0 mmol/L BSO, 18 Amol/L PEG, 100
units/mL PEG-SOD, 100 units/mL PEG-catalase, or 50 units/mL PEG-SOD +
PEG-catalase. All stock solutions were dissolved in PBS except NAC was
dissolved in 1 mol/L sodium bicarbonate (pH 7.0), and the required volume
was added directly to complete cell culture media on cells to achieve the
desired final concentrations. All cells were placed in a 37jC incubator and
harvested at the time points indicated.
Cell pellet collection. Following treatment, medium was collected and
centrifuged to harvest floating cells. Attached cells were scrape harvested in
ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 4jC, the supernatant was discarded, and
the cell pellets were transferred to 1.5-mL tubes and frozen at 20jC until
biochemical analysis was done.
Glutathione assay. Cell pellets were thawed and homogenized in
50 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1.34 mmol/L
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid buffer. Total glutathione content was
determined by the method of Anderson (23). GSH and GSSG were distinguished by addition of 2 AL of a 1:1 mixture of 2-vinylpyridine and ethanol
per 30 AL of sample followed by incubation for 1 h and assayed as previously
described (24). All glutathione determinations were normalized to the
protein content of whole homogenates using the method of Lowry et al. (25).
Clonogenic cell survival experiments. Floating cells in medium from
the experimental dishes were collected and combined with the attached
cells from the same dish that were trypsinized with 1-mL trypsin-EDTA
(CellGro, Herndon, VA) and inactivated with DMEM containing 10% FBS
(Hyclone). The cells were diluted and counted using a Coulter counter. Cells
were plated at low density (300–1,000 per plate) and clones were allowed to
grow in a humidified 5% CO2, 37jC environment for 14 days in complete
medium in the presence of 0.1% gentamicin. Cells were fixed with 70%

ethanol and stained with Coomassie blue for analysis of clonogenic cell
survival as previously described (26). Individual assays were done with
multiple dilutions with at least four cloning dishes per data point, repeated
in at least three separate experiments.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism
version 4 for Windows (GraphPad Software San Diego, CA). To determine
differences between three or more means, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
post-tests was done. Two-way ANOVA was used to determine differences
over different time points and treatment groups. Error bars represent F1
SD. All statistical analyses were done at the P < 0.05 level of significance.

Results
Inhibition of cell growth with 2DG and cisplatin. 2DG at 20
mmol/L was chosen for the current studies to ensure that a
physiologically relevant ratio of 2DG/glucose (ratio, 0.8) was used
to inhibit glucose metabolism in the FaDu cells grown in DMEM
that contained 25 mmol/L glucose (27). In addition, 0.5 Amol/L
cisplatin was chosen because it represents a clinically relevant dose
that is within the achievable plasma levels in head and neck
patients during cisplatin therapy (28). The cell growth curves
shown in Fig. 1 show the growth delay of FaDu cells treated with 20
mmol/L 2DG and/or 0.5 Amol/L cisplatin over the 72-h exposure
period. Cells treated with 0.5 Amol/L cisplatin caused a significant
growth delay compared with the control cells at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 1).
Treatment of cells with 2DG inhibited cell growth and was
significantly different from control and cisplatin-treated cells at
48 and 72 h (Fig. 1). The combination of 20 mmol/L 2DG and 0.5
Amol/L cisplatin inhibited cell growth similar to 2DG alone (Fig. 1).
Enhanced cytotoxicity seen with the combination of 2DG
and cisplatin is inhibited by NAC. To determine if 2DG in
combination with cisplatin would increase clonogenic cell killing
compared with either drug alone, clonogenic assays were done
following treatment with 20 mmol/L 2DG and/or 0.5 Amol/L
cisplatin for 24 h. Treatment with 2DG or cisplatin alone caused
32% cell killing relative to untreated control cells (Fig. 2A). The
combination of 2DG and cisplatin caused a significant increase to
80% cell killing, suggesting at least an additive and possibly a more
than additive effect of 2DG and cisplatin when compared with 2DG
and cisplatin alone (Fig. 2A). To probe the possible involvement of
oxidative stress in the mechanism responsible for 2DG and
cisplatin–induced cytotoxicity, the thiol antioxidant NAC was

investigated for its ability to alter the observed cytotoxicity. Cells
were treated with 15 mmol/L NAC for 1 h before and during
exposure to 2DG and cisplatin and analyzed for clonogenic
survival. NAC inhibited the cytotoxicity induced by treatment with
cisplatin alone and partially but significantly inhibited the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

combination of 2DG and cisplatin but not 2DG alone (Fig. 2A).
To assess the ability of NAC to rescue the cells from 2DG in
combination with cisplatin after the drugs were allowed to interact
with the cells, treatment with NAC was given either 1 h before or
1 h after the addition of 2DG and cisplatin. Consequently, we found
that there was no statistically significant difference in the ability of
NAC to rescue cells from the toxicity seen when NAC was added
1 h after 2DG and cisplatin, relative to when NAC was added
1 h before 2DG and cisplatin (data not shown). These results
support the hypothesis that the direct reaction of cisplatin with
NAC does not seem to completely account for the protective effects
of NAC and that some other mechanism (which could include
inhibition of oxidative stress) seems to play a role in the toxicity
seen with the combination of 2DG + cisplatin. Taken together,
these results suggest that treatment with a thiol antioxidant is able
to significantly inhibit the cytotoxicity induced by 2DG in
combination with cisplatin in human head and neck cancer cells.
2DG and cisplatin–induced disruptions in glutathione
metabolism indicative of oxidative stress are inhibited by
NAC. Glutathione is a major intracellular redox buffer such that the
ratio of GSH to GSSG can be used as a reflection of intracellular
redox status (29). Because glucose deprivation has previously been
shown to alter GSH/GSSG levels (5–10) consistent with causing
oxidative stress, thiol analysis was done to determine if NAC
caused any effects on intracellular GSH/GSSG in cells treated with
2DG and cisplatin. Exposure of cells to 2DG and the combination of
2DG + cisplatin caused a 30% to 40% decrease in total glutathione
content whereas cisplatin treatment alone did not seem to
significantly alter total glutathione levels (Fig. 2B). Coincubation
with 15 mmol/L NAC inhibited the effects of 2DG and 2DG +
cisplatin on total glutathione compared with the same treatment
groups without NAC (Fig. 2B). The combination of 2DG and
cisplatin caused the percentage of GSSG to increase >3-fold
compared with control (Fig. 2C), indicating that this drug
combination was causing oxidative stress. When the cells were
treated with the combination of 2DG and cisplatin in the presence
of NAC, percentage of GSSG decreased to control levels (Fig. 2C).
Taken together, the data in Fig. 2 suggest that the cytotoxic effects
of 2DG in combination with cisplatin were mediated by disruptions
in thiol metabolism consistent with oxidative stress, which was
reversed by the thiol antioxidant NAC.
Inhibition of 2DG cytotoxicity with PEG-SOD and PEGcatalase. To investigate the role of superoxide and hydrogen
peroxide in the biological effects of 2DG, FaDu cells were
pretreated with 100 units/mL PEG-SOD or PEG-catalase or 50
units/mL PEG-SOD + 50 units/mL PEG-catalase for 1 h before
and during treatment with 2DG for 24 h. The survival data
in Fig. 3 show that PEG-SOD and PEG-catalase significantly
protected the cells from 2DG-induced cytotoxicity (P < 0.01). The
combination of PEG-SOD and PEG-catalase seemed to further
increase the protection from 2DG toxicity induced by PEG-SOD
and PEG-catalase alone, but these differences did not reach
statistical significance when compared with either agent alone
(Fig. 3). Exposure of cells to PEG, PEG-SOD, and PEG-catalase in
the absence of 2DG had no effect on survival (data not shown).
Cells treated with 2DG + PEG showed no inhibition of toxicity
showing that the protection exhibited by PEG-SOD and PEGcatalase was due to the antioxidant enzymes and not due to PEG
(Fig. 3). These results strongly suggest that increases in ROS (i.e.,
superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) contribute to the toxicity
induced by 2DG.

GSSG in 2DG + cisplatin + BSO treated cells (Fig. 4C), as well as
suppressed the cytotoxicity of 2DG + cisplatin + BSO (Fig. 4A),
supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress was causally related to
the enhanced toxicity seen with these three drugs.

2DG and cisplatin–induced cytotoxicity is enhanced by BSO.
To determine if GSH depletion would enhance the toxicity and
oxidative stress induced by treatment with 2DG and cisplatin, FaDu
cells were treated with 1 mmol/L BSO for 1 h before and during
treatment with 2DG and cisplatin for 24 h. The results indicate that
treatment with the combination of 2DG and BSO enhanced cell
killing compared with 2DG alone (30% versus 60% cell killing,
respectively), whereas the combination of cisplatin and BSO also
enhanced cell killing compared with cisplatin alone (40% versus
78%, respectively; Fig. 4A). Additionally, Fig. 4A shows that BSO
further sensitized cells to the cytotoxicity of the combination of
2DG and cisplatin (2DG + cisplatin + BSO, >95% killing, versus 2DG
+ cisplatin, 85% killing). Furthermore, NAC partially but significantly protected against the cytotoxicity of 2DG + cisplatin + BSO
(Fig. 4A). The control of BSO + NAC was not different from BSO
alone in our cell model system (data not shown). These data
support the hypothesis that inhibition of glutathione (GSH)
synthesis with BSO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity
observed with 2DG and cisplatin in FaDu cells.
2DG and cisplatin–induced oxidative stress is enhanced by
BSO. To determine if oxidative stress contributed to the cytotoxic
effect of 2DG, cisplatin, and BSO, thiol analysis was done on FaDu
cells treated with the three drugs alone and in combination (Fig. 4B
and C). BSO caused significant GSH depletion compared with
treatments without BSO (Fig. 4B). In addition, cells treated with 2DG
+ BSO and 2DG + cisplatin + BSO showed significant increases in
percentage of GSSG (11- and 20-fold, respectively) compared with
the other treatments (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, exposure to NAC
significantly decreased the percentage of GSSG induced by treatment with 2DG + cisplatin + BSO (Fig. 4C). These results indicate
that BSO effectively decreased total GSH and increased a parameter
indicative of oxidative stress (percentage of GSSG) when coincubated with 2DG and the combination of 2DG and cisplatin. Furthermore, the fact that NAC suppressed the increase in percentage of

Discussion
Cancer cells have been suggested to have a fundamental defect
in their respiratory mechanism, which has been suggested to lead
to increased generation of pro-oxidants (i.e., superoxide, hydrogen
peroxide, etc.) by mitochondria (5–10). In addition, increased
glucose metabolism and pentose phosphate cycle activity have
been observed in cancer cells compared with untransformed
(normal) cells (1–4). Because the products of glucose metabolism,
pyruvate ( from glycolysis) and NADPH ( from the pentose cycle),
are believed to function in hydroperoxide detoxification (30, 31), it
is hypothesized that the up-regulation in glucose metabolism
in cancer cells is necessary to produce more pyruvate and NADPH
to compensate for the increase in intracellular pro-oxidant
production.
The increased dependency of cancer cells on glucose metabolism for hydroperoxide detoxification is an attractive target that
may be exploited to gain a therapeutic advantage when trying to
kill cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. Accordingly, glucose
deprivation and treatment with 2DG have been shown to induce
cytotoxicity, significant increases in pro-oxidant production, and
profound disruptions in thiol metabolism in colon, breast, cervical,
and prostate cancer cells, suggesting that oxidative stress was
involved with the mechanism of action (5–10). In the current
studies, 2DG was used to mimic the effects of glucose deprivation
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells. 2DG is a
clinically relevant analogue of glucose that competes with glucose
for uptake and entry into glucose metabolic pathways (22, 32–35).
2DG can therefore create a drug-induced state of glucose
deprivation, although it does not completely inhibit the regeneration of NADPH from NADP+ because it is a substrate for glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase (35). Inhibition of glucose metabolism
was observed in animals administered 2DG without toxicity until
high levels (>2 g/kg body weight) were achieved (32) and 2DG has
been shown to be tolerable in humans when administered up to
200 mg/kg (27).
In the current study, we have shown that 2DG completely
inhibited FaDu cell growth over the 72-h exposure period (Fig. 1)
while causing 32% clonogenic inactivation after a 24-h exposure
period (Fig. 2A). These findings support previous studies from our
laboratory, which have shown 2DG-induced growth inhibition and
cytotoxicity in MDA-MB231 cells (8), which was accompanied by
increases in parameters indicative of oxidative stress and enhanced
with BSO treatment. Interestingly, other researchers have shown
that 2DG increased the efficacy of Adriamycin and paclitaxel in
human osteosarcoma and non–small-cell lung cancers in vivo (36).
This suggests that 2DG may potentially increase the efficacy of
standard chemotherapeutic drugs. Based on these previous studies,
we hypothesized that 2DG combined with cisplatin would increase
toxicity in FaDu head and neck cancer cells by mechanisms
involving oxidative stress, which could be enhanced with BSO.
Cisplatin has been successfully used as a chemotherapeutic
agent against malignant solid tumors in the head and neck region
(11). However, there have been barriers to the use of cisplatin in the
clinical setting of head and neck cancer including nephrotoxicity
(37) and cisplatin resistance (18, 38). By combining relatively
nontoxic drugs such as 2DG and BSO with cisplatin, it is possible
that tumor cell killing could be enhanced at lower doses, therefore
minimizing the side effects of cisplatin as well as potentially
helping to overcome cisplatin resistance. In the current study, we
found that the combination of 2DG and cisplatin showed at least

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

additive (and possibly more than additive) cell killing in FaDu cells
compared with 2DG or cisplatin alone (Fig. 2A).
The increase in percentage of GSSG induced by 2DG + cisplatin
(Fig. 2C) suggests that oxidative stress is involved. We believe that
the combination of 2DG + cisplatin causes an increase in steady
state levels of hydroperoxides and this increase exceeds the
metabolic capabilities of the glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase system to maintain glutathione in the reduced form.
To further support this idea, the thiol antioxidant NAC was able
to inhibit the increase in percentage of GSSG (Fig. 2C) and inhibit
the cytotoxicity induced by 2DG + cisplatin (Fig. 2A). Because NAC
caused significant increases in total glutathione in 2DG- and/or
cisplatin-treated cells (Fig. 2B), NAC may function by increasing
intracellular thiol pools necessary for counteracting the effects of
2DG and cisplatin.
Key reactive oxygen species (ROS)–detoxifying enzymes in the
cell include SOD, which removes superoxide anion, and catalase,
which degrades hydrogen peroxide (9, 39). Because the cytotoxicity
induced by 2DG was not significantly inhibited with NAC (Fig. 2A),
we examined the possible role of ROS in the effects of 2DG using
specific scavengers of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Treatment of the cells with the combination of the PEGylated forms of
SOD and catalase (PEG-SOD + PEG-catalase) significantly inhibited
the cytotoxicity induced by 2DG exposure (Fig. 3). These results
suggest that the biological effects of 2DG do involve superoxide and
H2O2. NAC may have not been able to inhibit the cytotoxicity
induced by 2DG because the subsequent increase in thiols induced
by NAC (Fig. 2B) was not sufficient to significantly enhance the
detoxification of the ROS produced from 2DG treatment. This
observation remains to be explored.
Although our data suggest that disruptions in thiol metabolism
are involved with the toxicity of cisplatin alone, this mechanism may
not be the underlying mechanism of cytotoxicity in cells treated with
2DG alone in this model system. However, the data shown in Fig. 3
.
suggest that O2 and H2O2 contribute to the mechanism of 2DGinduced cytotoxicity as evidenced by the ability of PEG-SOD + PEGcatalase to protect against 2DG-induced toxicity (Fig. 3). Therefore,
when 2DG is combined with cisplatin, increases in steady-state
levels of ROS caused by treatment with 2DG may enhance the
disruption in thiol metabolism caused by cisplatin, leading to
increased oxidative stress (as evidenced by increased percentage of
GSSG) and increased cell killing. Moreover, in support of this
interpretation, NAC is able to significantly inhibit cytotoxicity
induced by 2DG + cisplatin (Fig. 2A) as well as decrease oxidative
stress as measured by a decrease in percentage of GSSG (Fig. 2C).
Recently, we have shown that inhibition of GSH synthesis with
BSO increased parameters indicative of oxidative stress and
sensitized breast cancer cells to 2DG-induced cytotoxicity (8).
BSO is an inhibitor of glutamate cysteine ligase, which is believed
to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of GSH (40, 41). BSO
has also been used in clinical trials for cancer therapy to enhance
the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents (42). In the current
study, BSO was found to sensitize FaDu cells to 2DG and cisplatin
as well as significantly increase the cytotoxicity induced by 2DG +
cisplatin (Fig. 4A). As expected, BSO significantly decreased total
GSH levels when combined with 2DG and/or cisplatin (Fig. 4B).
When BSO was combined with 2DG, oxidative stress was enhanced,
as evidenced by increases in percentage of GSSG (Fig. 4C), which
is comparable to previous results in our laboratory in MDAMB231 human breast cancer cells (8). This would be expected given
that superoxide and hydrogen peroxide seem to contribute to

2DG-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 3) and glutathione is integrally
related to hydrogen peroxide detoxification through the action of
glutathione peroxidase. When BSO was combined with 2DG +
cisplatin, percentage of GSSG further increased, suggesting that the
depletion of GSH with BSO further enhanced the oxidative stress
induced by 2DG + cisplatin (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, NAC significantly inhibited the cytotoxicity and the increase in oxidative
stress (as evidenced by decreased percentage of GSSG) induced by
2DG + cisplatin + BSO without reversing the effects of BSO on GSH
depletion (Fig. 4A and C). These results support the hypothesis that
NAC inhibits the oxidative stress associated with 2DG + cisplatin +
BSO independent of increased GSH, suggesting that NAC acts
to augment intracellular thiol antioxidants and inhibit thiol oxidation reactions that do not depend entirely on GSH synthesis.
Additionally, these results support the hypothesis that metabolic
oxidative stress significantly contributes to the interaction of 2DG
+ cisplatin F BSO in killing FaDu cells in this cell culture model.
Manipulations of glutathione have long been known to affect
cellular sensitivity to cisplatin (43–47), with levels of GSH and
cisplatin resistance being directly proportional. However, the
mechanism leading to cisplatin resistance under conditions of
increased GSH is unclear. Many types of drugs are detoxified by
conjugation to glutathione and subsequent export or degradation.
Although this may occur to some degree, cisplatin is not a substrate
for any glutathione S-transferase known to detoxify other drugs (44).
In addition, Ikeda et al. (45) found that cell lines with elevated levels
of GSH were resistant to cisplatin but cell lines with elevated GSH
contained higher levels of platinum. Other possibilities include
alterations in signal transduction via c-jun NH2-terminal kinase
signaling (46), alterations in DNA repair via DNA-dependent protein

kinase (47), and/or alterations in the function of glutathione
peroxidase. Both of the former two processes have been shown to
be affected by glutathione metabolism and to affect the cellular
responses to cisplatin. The data provided here suggest that increased
intracellular oxidative stress contributes to the toxicity of 2DG +
cisplatin, and manipulating intracellular redox levels can affect
cellular responses to 2DG + cisplatin. These findings may also suggest ways to improve the efficacy of 2DG + cisplatin as a sensitizer
to the oxidative stress induced by exposure to ionizing radiation.
The scheme shown in Fig. 5 illustrates some of the hypothetical
relationships between glucose metabolism, ROS metabolism,
chemotherapeutic agents, and antioxidants suggested by the
results of the current study. Inhibiting glucose metabolism with
2DG in cancer cells is hypothesized to limit the production of
pyruvate and the regeneration of NADPH leading to increased
.
steady-state levels of O2 and H2O2 from metabolic sources
resulting in cytotoxicity, which was inhibited by the antioxidant
enzymes SOD and catalase. Combining 2DG and cisplatin is
believed to enhance oxidative stress because cisplatin is known to
be both a DNA-damaging agent and a potential inhibitor of the
thioredoxin system, which is also involved with thiol homeostasis
as well as the detoxification of hydroperoxides. BSO is thought to
further enhance the toxicity of 2DG and cisplatin by inhibiting the
synthesis of GSH that is required for GSH peroxidases and GSH
transferases, both of which are believed to protect against oxidative
stress. Finally, the thiol antioxidant NAC is able to protect against
the combination of 2DG + cisplatin by acting to augment small
molecular weight intracellular thiols that are capable of scavenging
toxic species as well as protecting critical biomolecules from
oxidation as well as alkylation. Overall, the results of this study

Figure 5. Hypothetical biochemical rationale to explain the interaction between 2DG and cisplatin. 2DG competes with glucose for uptake into the cell and
phosphorylation by hexokinase into 2-deoxy-D-glucose-6-phosphate (2DG-6-P ) and glucose-6-phosphate (Glucose-6-P ). Glucose-6-phosphate continues into
glycolysis to form pyruvate, a known scavenger of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), whereas 2-deoxy-D-glucose-6-phosphate is unable to continue glycolysis. Glucose-6phosphate and 2-deoxy-D-glucose-6-phosphate proceed through the first step in the pentose phosphate cycle via glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH )
to 6-phosphogluconolactone and 6-phospho-2-deoxygluconolactone, respectively, leading to the generation of NADPH from NADP+. However, 6-phospho-2deoxygluconolactone cannot go further in the pentose phosphate cycle. NADPH is a source of reducing equivalents for the glutathione system consisting of GSH,
GSSG, glutathione peroxidase (GPx ), and glutathione reductase (GR ) and the thioredoxin system consisting of reduced thioredoxin [Trx(SH)2 ], thioredoxin disulfide
[Trx(S2)], thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx ), and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR ; inhibited by cisplatin). The glutathione and thioredoxin systems participate in the
.
detoxification of H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides. Superoxide dismutase (SOD ) converts superoxide (O2 ) to H2O2, which is converted to H2O by catalase (CAT )
or glutathione peroxidase. NAC provides cysteine, which reacts with L-glutamate catalyzed by glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL ; inhibited by BSO) to form
g-glutamyl-cysteine. Glutathione synthetase (GS ) converts g-glutamyl-cysteine into GSH. Dashed arrows, inhibition processes.

support the hypothesis that 2DG combined with cisplatin enhances
cytotoxicity in FaDu human head and neck cancer cells by a
mechanism involving oxidative stress and disruptions in thiol
metabolism. These data also strongly support the potential
therapeutic use of 2DG in combination with cisplatin, as well as
the new biochemical rationale shown in Fig. 5 for combining
inhibitors of glucose and hydroperoxide metabolism for enhancing
the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents thought to cause injury via
oxidative stress.
