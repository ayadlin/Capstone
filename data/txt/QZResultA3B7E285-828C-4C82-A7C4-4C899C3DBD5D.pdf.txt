Abstract

Author Manuscript

Human tumours exhibit a large degree of cellular and genetic heterogeneity 1. Complex cell
interactions in the tumour and its microenvironment are thought to play a significant role in
tumourigenesis and cancer progression 2. It is also known that cooperation between oncogenic
genetic lesions is required for tumour development 3. However, it is not known how cell
interactions contribute to oncogenic cooperation. The genetic techniques available in the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster allow analysis of the behavior of cells with distinct mutations 4, giving
this model organism a privileged position to study cell interactions and oncogenic cooperation. In
Drosophila eye-antennal discs, cooperation between the oncogenic protein RasV12 5 and loss-offunction mutations in the conserved tumour suppressor scribble (scrib) 6,7 gives rise to metastatic
tumours that display many characteristics observed in human cancers 8-11. Here we show that
clones of cells bearing different mutations can cooperate to promote tumour growth and invasion
in Drosophila. We found that the RasV12 and scrib− mutations can also cause tumours when they
affect different adjacent epithelial cells. We show that this interaction between RasV12 and scrib−
clones involves JNK signaling propagation and JNK-induced upregulation of JAK/STATactivating cytokines, a compensatory growth mechanism for tissue homeostasis. The development
of RasV12 tumours can also be triggered by tissue damage, a stress condition that activates JNK
signaling. Given the conservation of the pathways examined here, similar cooperative mechanisms
could play a role in the development of human cancers.

Clones of mutant cells marked with green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be generated in the
eye-antenna imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae by mitotic recombination. Clones
expressing the oncogenic protein RasV12 moderately overgrow 12 (Fig. 1a, b). Clones
mutant for scrib lose apico-basal polarity and die 6,13 (Fig. 1c). In contrast, scrib clones
simultaneously expressing RasV12 grow into large metastatic tumours (Fig. 1d) 8. To better
understand cooperation between these two mutations, we produced animals in which cell
division after a mitotic recombination event creates two daughter cells, one expressing
RasV12 and the other mutant for scrib. Discs containing adjacent RasV12 (GFP-positive) and
scrib− clones developed into large tumours, capable of invading the ventral nerve cord
(VNC) (Fig. 1e). This shows that RasV12 and scrib cooperate for tumour induction also
when they occur in different cells. We will refer to these tumours as RasV12//scrib− tumours,
to denote interclonal oncogenic cooperation and distinguish them from RasV12scrib−
tumours, in which cooperation occurs in the same cells intraclonally.

In the late stages of the development of RasV12//scrib− tumours, most cells in the tumour
mass are RasV12 cells (Fig. 1h, i). scrib− cells, as well as residual wild-type cells, are almost
completely absent from the tissue, similar to the absence of wild-type cells in late
RasV12scrib− tumours (Fig. 1f, g). To test the possibility that RasV12//scrib− tumours are
caused by unopposed growth of RasV12 cells, we examined eye-antennal discs where all
cells expressed RasV12. Dramatic overgrowth or invasion did not occur (Supplementary Fig.
1), showing that interaction between RasV12 and scrib− cells is required for tumour
development. Interclonal cooperation between RasV12 and lethal giant larvae (lgl) also
produced tumours (Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting that other polarity mutations can
cooperate interclonally with RasV12. Intrigued by these findings, we decided to investigate
the mechanisms underlying non-autonomous oncogenic cooperation and sustained growth in
RasV12//scrib− tumours.
JAK/STAT signaling promotes cell proliferation in different contexts in mammals and flies
14, including the overgrowth caused by mutation of several tumour suppressors 15. In a
cDNA microarray analysis of RasV12scrib− tumours, we discovered upregulation of the
unpaired genes (upd, upd2 and upd3; data not shown), which encode JAK/STAT-activating
cytokines related to Interleukin 6 16-18. We confirmed the upregulation of the unpaired
genes in RasV12scrib− and RasV12//scrib− tumours by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 2a).
Furthermore, we observed elevated expression of the JAK/STAT reporter STAT-GFP 19 in
both RasV12scrib− and RasV12//scrib− tumours (Fig. 2b-e), thus correlating high expression
of Upd cytokines with increased JAK/STAT activity.

Author Manuscript

To test the involvement of JAK/STAT signaling in the growth of RasV12scrib− and RasV12//
scrib− tumours, we used a dominant negative form of the JAK/STAT receptor Domeless
(DomeDN) 20. Expression of DomeDN achieved suppression of overgrowth and invasion of
the VNC in RasV12scrib− tumours (Fig. 2f). Also RasV12//scrib− tumours were suppressed
by expression of DomeDN in RasV12 cells (Fig. 2g). A loss-of-function mutation in stat92E,
encoding the Drosophila STAT transcriptional activator, reduced growth and invasiveness
of RasV12scrib− and RasV12//scrib− tumours (Supplementary Fig. 3). From these
experiments, we conclude that JAK/STAT signaling is required for the development of
RasV12scrib− and RasV12//scrib− tumours.

The suppression of RasV12scrib− and RasV12//scrib− tumours by reducing JAK/STAT
activity in RasV12 cells points to cooperation between Ras and JAK/STAT signaling as a
cause of tumour growth. To confirm this, we generated clones of cells co-expressing Upd
cytokines and RasV12. While Upd overexpression in wild-type cells (Fig. 2h), in scrib− cells
or in wild-type cells adjacent to scrib− cells (Supplementary Fig. 4) did not cause tumours,
co-expression of RasV12 and Upd produced large invasive tumours (Fig. 2i). Similar results
were obtained co-expressing RasV12 and Upd2 (Fig. 2j), whereas co-expression of RasV12
and Upd3 caused smaller, non-invasive tumours (Fig. 2k). Finally, RasV12Upd Upd2
tumours were larger than RasV12Upd and RasV12Upd2 tumours (Fig. 2l), suggesting an
additive effect of the expression of different Upd cytokines (see also Supplementary Fig. 5).

Author Manuscript

Prevention of actual cell death in cells apoptotically stimulated has been shown to potently
promote overgrowth 21. To assess a possible involvement of apoptosis prevention in the
synergy between Ras and JAK/STAT signaling, we coexpressed the apoptosis inhibitor p35
with RasV12 or Upd. Neither conditions produced tumours (Supplementary Fig. 6),
suggesting that cooperation between Ras and JAK/STAT involves a mechanism other than
apoptosis prevention. RasV12Upd tumours were suppressed by expression of DomeDN (Fig.
2m), thus confirming that their development requires JAK/STAT activity. In all, both lossand gain-of-function experiments lead us to conclude that Ras and JAK/STAT signaling
exhibit a strong synergistic tumour-promoting interaction, responsible for the development
of RasV12scrib− and RasV12//scrib− tumours.

Author Manuscript

Having established the involvement of JAK/STAT signaling in the growth of RasV12scrib−
and RasV12//scrib− tumours, we decided to investigate how expression of the Upd cytokines
is upregulated. We previously showed that expression of the unpaired genes is elevated in
wounds in a JNK-dependent manner 22. It has been shown as well that JNK signaling can
induce non-autonomous overgrowth 23,24 and that JNK signaling is upregulated in scrib−
clones 13,25 and scrib− discs 22, which develop as tumours in scrib− larvae 6. To test the
possibility that JNK activation causes ectopic JAK/STAT signaling in scrib− cells, we
monitored STAT-GFP expression in discs double mutant for scrib and hep, coding for the
Drosophila JNK-kinase Hemipterous. In these discs, STAT-GFP expression was reduced
and overgrowth suppressed (Fig. 3a-c), showing that JAK/STAT elevation in scrib− cells
depends on JNK activity.

Author Manuscript

The induction of Upd cytokines by JNK in scrib− cells can explain the growth of
RasV12scrib− tumours, placing JAK-STAT signaling downstream of JNK. In support of this,
a dominant negative form of the Jun-kinase Basket (BskDN) suppressed RasV12scrib−
tumours 9 (Fig. 3d, e), but not RasV12Upd tumours (Fig. 3f, g). In the case of RasV12//scrib−
tumours, few scrib− cells remain in the tissue at late stages (Fig. 1i). Therefore, Upd
induction in scrib− cells cannot fully account for tumour development. Indeed, expression of
BskDN in RasV12 cells partially suppressed the growth of RasV12//scrib− tumours (Fig. 3h, i)
and expression of the unpaired genes (Fig. 3j). This shows that in RasV12//scrib− tumours
expression of Upd cytokines downstream of JNK signaling also occurs in RasV12 cells.
scrib− clones cause JNK activation both autonomously and non-autonomously 25.
Furthermore, in wing discs, wounding induces JNK activation away from the site of

wounding 22,26, suggesting that JNK activity can propagate. To investigate this, we
wounded wing discs and examined the expression of puckered (puc), a JNK downstream
gene encoding a JNK-phosphatase that negatively regulates the pathway 27. When wounds
were induced in the anterior or posterior wing regions, JNK activation, revealed by puc-lacZ
expression, was observed across the disc in the opposite compartment (Fig. 3k). In contrast,
overexpression of Puc in a central stripe of cells prevented expansion of JNK to the opposite
compartment. (Fig. 3l, Supplemental Fig. 7). This indicates that JNK activity propagates
through a feed-forward loop and, together with previous findings, suggests that in RasV12//
scrib− tumours, scrib− cells trigger JNK activation and that this activation propagates to
adjacent RasV12 cells. JNK-dependent upregulation of Upd cytokines in RasV12 cells, thus,
can sustain tumour growth when the original source of JNK activity, the scrib− cells, is no
longer present.

Author Manuscript

The previous experiments reveal a central role for JNK in the cooperation of RasV12 and
scrib−. Since both wounds and scrib− induce JNK activation, we tested the possibility that
tissue damage could cooperate with RasV12 to promote tumour overgrowth. We wounded
larval right wing discs and examined them 48 hours later. In wild-type discs, compared to
the unwounded left disc, wounding resulted in size reduction (Fig 4a, b; Supplementary Fig.
8; wounded/unwounded size ratio ±SD=0.70±0.18). In contrast, wounding of RasV12expressing discs caused a marked increase in RasV12-induced overgrowth (Fig. 4c, d;
Supplementary Fig. 8; 1.46±0.31). No metastasis was detected in this experiment (not
shown). Finally, the wounded/unwounded ratio in p35-expressing discs (1.09±0.14,
Supplementary Fig. 8) shows that apoptosis prevention by RasV12 cannot completely
account for its cooperation with mechanically-induced damage.

Author Manuscript

The fact that both scrib− clones and tissue damage induce overgrowth of RasV12 tissue
suggests that compensatory proliferation in response to scrib− cells could underlie
cooperation in RasV12//scrib− tumours. To test this, we studied the effect of confronting
scrib− cells with cells mutant for stat92E. When scrib− clones are generated in eye-antennal
discs, scrib− cells in the adult eye are mostly absent 13 and the eye appears normal in size
(Fig. 4e, f). When stat92E− cells confront scrib− cells, in contrast, the eye is greatly reduced
(Fig. 4g, h; Supplemental Fig. 9), showing that stat92E− cells cannot compensate for the loss
of scrib− cells. These data indicate a role for JAK/STAT signaling in tissue homeostasis
through compensatory proliferation (see also Supplemental Figs. 9 and 10). Therefore, a
mechanism to ensure recovery after damage explains the development of RasV12scrib− and
RasV12//scrib− tumours and can mediate interclonal oncogenic cooperation (Fig. 4i).

Author Manuscript

We have used Drosophila to investigate how oncogenic cooperation between different cells
can promote tumour growth and invasion. Our experiments, addressed to understanding
interclonal cooperation in RasV12//scrib− tumours, uncovered a two-tier mechanism by
which scrib− cells promote neoplastic development of RasV12 cells: (1) propagation of
stress-induced JNK activity from scrib− cells to RasV12 cells and (2) expression of the JAK/
STAT-activating Unpaired cytokines downstream of JNK. Our findings, therefore, highlight
the importance of cell interactions in oncogenic cooperation and tumour development. We
also show that stress-induced JNK signaling and epigenetic factors such as tissue damage
can contribute to tumour development in flies. Interestingly, tissue damage caused by

conditions such as chronic inflammation has been linked to tumourigenesis in humans
28,29. Furthermore, expression of the Unpaired cytokines promotes tumour growth (this
study) as well as an antitumoural immune response 22, which parallels the situation in mice
and humans 30. Future research into phenomena such as compensatory growth and
interclonal cooperation in Drosophila will provide valuable insights into the biology of
cancer.

STAT-activating cytokines Upd, Upd2 and Upd3, in eye-antennal discs containing wild-type
clones, RasV12-expressing clones, scrib− clones (day 6 AEL), RasV12scrib− tumours and
RasV12//scrib− tumours (day 10 AEL). Expression is normalized to the housekeeping gene
rp49. Error bars depict 95% confidence intervals (1.96 × s.e.m., n=3). b-e, Expression of the
JAK/STAT reporter STAT-GFP (green) in day 6 AEL eye-antennal discs containing wildtype clones (b, red), RasV12 clones (c), RasV12scrib− (d) and RasV12//scrib− tumours (e). f,
g, Suppression of RasV12scrib− (f) and RasV12//scrib− (g) tumours by expression of a
dominant negative form of the JAK/STAT receptor Domeless (DomeDN). h, Clones
overexpressing Upd. i-l, Tumours caused by RasV12 clones co-overexpressing Upd (i), Upd2
(j), Upd3 (k) and both Upd and Upd2 (l). m, RasV12Upd tumours are suppressed by
DomeDN.

a-c, STAT-GFP expression in wing discs of wild-type larvae (a) and scrib− larvae
heterozygous (b) or hemizygous (male, c) for the JNK-kinase loss-of-function mutation
hepr75. Overgrowth and STAT-GFP upregulation are suppressed by hepr75. Arrowheads
point to normal STAT-GFP expression in the wing hinge. Discs stained with phalloidin
(red). d-g, Expression of a dominant negative form of the Jun-kinase Basket (BskDN)
suppresses RasV12scrib− tumours (d, e), but not RasV12Upd tumours (f, g). h, i, Expression
of BskDN in RasV12 cells partially suppresses RasV12//scrib− tumours. j, Quantification by
real-time RT-PCR of expression of the upd genes in RasV12//scrib− and RasV12BskDN//
scrib− tumours (day 6 AEL). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (n=3). k,
Propagation of JNK activity (puc-lacZ reporter, green) into the posterior (P) compartment
(arrowhead) in wing discs wounded in the anterior (A) compartment (asterisk) 24 hours after
wounding. l, puc-lacZ expression in discs expressing the JNK-phosphatase Puc under
control of ptc-GAL4 (red cells, expressing RFP), wounded as in k. Puc is both a
downstream target and a negative regulator of JNK. Propagation of puc-lacZ expression into
the P compartment is not observed (hollow arrowhead).

a-d, Cooperation between RasV12 and tissue damage. Right (wounded) and left (unwounded)
wing discs of a wild-type larva (a, b) and a larva expressing RasV12 under control of nubGAL4 (c, d). Discs were wounded by repeated pinching and dissected 48h later. Expression
of RFP driven by nub-GAL4 marks the wing blade region (red). Cell nuclei stained with
DAPI (blue). e-h, Requirement of JAK/STAT signaling in compensatory proliferation.
Wild-type (e) and stat92E− (g) clones in adult eyes, marked by absence of red pigment. In
eyes containing scrib− clones confronted with wild-type cells (f), scrib− cells (red) are
mostly absent and size of the eye is largely normal. In eyes containing scrib− clones (red)
confronted with stat92E− cells (h), the size of the eye is reduced. i, Model for the
involvement of JNK and JAK/STAT signaling in intraclonal and interclonal cooperation
between RasV12 and scrib−. See text for details.
