ABSTRACT
Chicoric acid (CA) is a phenolic compound present in dietary supplements with a
large spectrum of biological properties reported ranging from antioxidant, to antiviral,
to immunostimulatory properties. Due to the fact that chicoric acid promotes phagocytic
activity and was reported as an allosteric inhibitor of the PTP1B phosphatase, we
examined the effect of CA on YopH phosphatase from pathogenic bacteria, which block
phagocytic processes of a host cell. We performed computational studies of chicoric
acid binding to YopH as well as validation experiments with recombinant enzymes. In
addition, we performed similar studies for caffeic and chlorogenic acids to compare
the results. Docking experiments demonstrated that, from the tested compounds,
only CA binds to both catalytic and secondary binding sites of YopH. Our experimental
results showed that CA reduces activity of recombinant YopH phosphatase from
Yersinia enterocolitica and human CD45 phosphatase. The inhibition caused by CA
was irreversible and did not induce oxidation of catalytic cysteine. We proposed that
inactivation of YopH induced by CA is involved with allosteric inhibition by interacting
with essential regions responsible for ligand binding.

properties, promoting phagocyte activity in vitro and
in vivo [8], and to inhibit hyaluronidase, a key enzyme
involved in bacterial infection [9]. In addition, CA has
antiviral activity [10] and has been reported to inhibit
HIV integrase and replication [11, 12, 13]. The inhibitory
properties of CA against HIV-1 integrase were confirmed
by computational modeling performed by one of the
co-authors of the present paper [14]. The activity of CA
against the herpes simplex virus has been demonstrated
[15, 16]. The antioxidant activity of CA was found to be
comparable with that of rosmarinic acid [17, 18]. The
anti-proliferative activity has been shown for CA [3], and
anti-cancer, through inducing apoptosis of human colon
cancer cells [19]. Chicoric acid, through potent binding at
the allosteric site, has been showed to inhibit allosterically
protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, which play essential
role in diabetes and breast cancer [20, 21]. There are
many studies on implications of other PTPs in cancer
development [22, 23, 24].

Chicoric acid (CA; Figure 1A), a derivative of both
caffeic acid and tartaric acid, known also as cichoric acid
and dicaffeoyltartaric acid, is the main phenolic compound
found in Echinacea purpurea [1]. It was identified
in many plant families, including those of seagrass,
horsetail, fern and lemon balm [2]. Due to its presence in
basil, chicory and lettuce, CA is important ingredient of
Mediterranean diet [3, 4, 5]. Chicoric acid is one of the
numerous active ingredients (alkamides, polysaccharides,
and glycoproteins) associated with human health beneﬁts
from E. purpurea dietary supplements [6, 7] and compared
with other phenolic acids, it succeeds on the nutraceutical
market.
Chicoric acid is a valuable natural product of special
interest owing to its large spectrum of beneficial biological
properties. It has been shown to have immunostimulatory

Caffeic acid is one of the main natural phenols
present in the argan oil, but it can also be found in coffee
or red wine [25]. Caffeic acid has been showed to have
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity [26]. Inhibitory
effect of caffeic acid on cancer cell proliferation has been
also reported [27, 28]. Chlorogenic acid is the ester of
caffeic acid present, i.a. in potatoes [29], with antioxidant
activity [30]. It has been demonstrated that chlorogenic
acid may slow the release of glucose into the bloodstream
after a meal [31].
Yersinia genius contains three species of bacteria
pathogenic to humans: plague-causing Yersinia pestis,
septicemia-inducing Yesinia pseudotuberculosis and
Yersinia enterocolitica, which is responsible for a range
of gastrointestinal disorders [32]. Yersinia pestis is
transmitted by fleas while Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y.
enterocolitica are transmitted by the fecal oral route [33].
Yersinia sp. utilizes a type III secretion system
for translocation of virulence effectors into the host cell
[34]. All three Yersinia species contain a 70kb plasmid
that encodes the complex type III secretion system and
effectors (Yops). During infection, Yersinia translocates
Yop virulence effectors into a host cell leading to
inhibition of the innate immune response [35].
One of Yersinia’s outer membrane protein effectors
is a highly active YopH protein tyrosine phosphatase,
which is essential for virulence since the YopH mutant
plasmid is avirulent [36]. YopH is causing deregulation
of cellular functions, disrupting focal complex structures
and blocking phagocytosis [37]. YopH disturbs the focal
adhesions by dephosphorylation of the focal adhesion
kinase (FAK) and suppresses the production of reactive
oxygen species by macrophages [38]. YopH has a similar
amino-acid sequence in the active site as other PTPs [39].
The hallmark defining the classical PTPs is the
strictly conserved active site sequence C(X)5R within
the catalytic domain, which constitutes the phosphatebinding pocket of the enzyme [40]. Like eukaryotic PTPs,
YopH catalyzes the hydrolysis of the phosphate moiety
on tyrosine residues within a highly conserved binding
pocket, which is also characterized by the closure of the
WPD loop upon ligand binding [41]. The cysteine residue
inside the active site exists in the thiolate anion form,
and is highly prone to oxidation [42]. Oxidation of the
cysteine residue leads to the formation of a reversible
form of the sulfenic acid residue, while a highly oxidizing
environment can induce further oxidation yielding
physiologically irreversible sulfinic and sulfonic acid
residues, all of which consequently cause inactivation of
the enzyme [43]. Oxidative stress, defined as excessive
reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, may induce
inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Inactivation
via oxidation was suggested as a mechanism of protein
tyrosine phosphatases regulation [44].
Due to the fact that chicoric acid is promoting
phagocytosis [8] and is able to effectively inhibit protein
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B [20], we decided to examine
the effect of CA on bacterial tyrosine phosphatase from
Yersinia enterocolitica. We also compared it with the effect
of CA on human CD45 phosphatase. We performed assays
with recombinant enzymes as well as computational
analysis of chicoric acid binding. In addition, we
performed similar studies for caffeic and chlorogenic acids
to compare the results.

RESULTS
Docking studies shown that chicoric acid can bind
to YopH catalytic and secondary binding site
Chicoric acid molecule was docked into the 3D
structure of YopH in order to investigate the possible
binding conformation and affinity. We performed blind
flexible docking and retained top 30 conformations from
docking runs. While 24 of these top scoring conformations
of chicoric acid bind to the active site of YopH, we found
that there are 6 conformations that bind to a second
binding site of YopH (Figure 1B). The docking studies
showed that chicoric acid can be easily accommodated
inside the binding site and binds specifically in a catalytic
center of YopH (Figure 1B).
The binding free energy and its components were
calculated for the YopH-chicoric acid complex by the
MM/GBSA method. The calculated free binding energies
as kcal mol-1 are presented in Figure 1C. In comparison
to the free binding energy for the YopH-natural substrate
phosphotyrosine complex previously calculated by
our group with the same methods and parameters as
-23.63±4.37 kcal mol-1 [45], the strength of binding of
chicoric acid in YopH is lower (-11.87±3.34 kcal mol-1).

Similar compounds as chlorogenic and caffeic
acid are able to bind only in catalytic site of YopH
Chlorogenic and caffeic acid molecules were
docked into the 3D structure of YopH in order to
investigate the possible binding conformation. We
performed blind flexible docking and retained top
conformations from docking runs. All of these top scoring
conformations of chlorogenic (Figure 2A) and caffeic acid
(Figure 2B) bind to the active site of YopH. We have not
observed any binding to a second binding site of YopH for
these compounds.

Chicoric acid induces irreversible inactivation of
YopH and CD45

enterocolitica and human CD45 phosphatase. We also
compared it with the effect of chlorogenic and caffeic acid.
We found that chicoric acid can reduce enzymatic activity
of both YopH and CD45 phosphatase. We observed higher
inhibitory effect of chicoric acid on YopH and CD45 in
comparison to chlorogenic and caffeic acids (Figure 3A).
We calculated IC50 values from a plot presenting chicoric
acid’s concentration versus percentage of the enzymatic
activity measured as absorbance with pNPP substrate of
recombinant YopH and CD45. The calculated IC50 values
of chicoric acid are similar for both enzymes and are in the
micromolar range (Figure 3A).

We performed a reduction assay to examine the
reversibility of chicoric acid induced YopH and CD45
inactivation. The results showed that the inhibition caused
by chicoric acid cannot be reversed to YopH and CD45
original activity (Figure 3B). In our studies, the 100 µM
chicoric acid caused YopH and CD45 inactivation cannot
be restored after a 30-minute incubation with 10 mM
dithiotreitol (Figure 3B).

acid

loop plays an important role in the catalytic process of
PTPases. Ligand binding significantly reduces the protein
flexibility and constrains the WPD loop predominately in
the closed form [48].

Many studies showed that the enzymatic activity of
PTPs can be reduced by oxidation of the catalytic cysteine
residue [43, 44, 46], which we have also previously
demonstrated for peracids [47]. To study the mechanism
of chicoric acid caused inactivation of YopH, we decided
to examine the amount of non-oxidized thiols groups. We
performed an assay for thiol adducts forming with NBDCl. Our results show that YopH and CD45 after treatment
with chicoric acid possess the same amount of reduced
thiol groups as in untreated control (Figure 3C, 3D).
The results allow us to assume that the catalytic cysteine
residue did not undergo oxidation after incubation with
chicoric acid and that the inactivation caused by chicoric
acid is probably not involved with oxidation of catalytic
thiolate in active site.

Chicoric acid interactions in YopH catalytic site
In a first step, we examined the interaction between
chicoric acid and amino acid residues in YopH binding
sites with blind flexible docking. The obtained results are
presented as PLIF diagrams for the best binding poses of
chicoric acid in the YopH catalytic site (Figure 4A). The
PLIF diagram presented in Figure 4A shows the predicted
binding pose in catalytic site of YopH, where two carboxyl
groups of chicoric acid are directed toward essential
Cys403 and Arg409 residues. There are electrostatic
interactions observed between polar groups of chicoric
acid with Cys403, Gln450 and water.
We performed flexible docking with selection of
the residues 287-297 form L2 (Figure 4B). We found that,
in the best binding pose selected for this region, the one
aromatic ring of chicoric acid interacts with Gly297 using
arene-H interaction and Gln294 interacts using a water
molecule. We can observe that Phe296 and Leu263 are
involved in hydrophobic interactions with chicoric acid.

Docking and molecular dynamic simulations of
chicoric acid-YopH complex
To examine the interaction between chicoric
acid and amino acid residues in YopH binding sites we
performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Both
blind (Figures 4A, 5A) and site specific (Figures 4B, 5B)
flexible docking was performed. We decided to focus on
the region surrounding the catalytic pocket from the loop
L2 and second binding site. The loop L2 is the region
surrounding the catalytic pocket and shows correlated
closure with the WPD loop [48]. The mobility of the WPD

second binding site of YopH performed with blind flexible
docking. There are interactions and binding between
chicoric acid and amino acids from the loop correlated
with the motion of WPD loop (Figure 5A). In the predicted
binding pose, Arg255 interacts with one aromatic ring
of chicoric acid using an arene-cation interaction. The
Arg380 from α4 is observed in close proximity (Figure
5A).
The crystallographic studies of PTP1B with small
molecular inhibitors have revealed that the region of
helices α3 and α6 (corresponding to helices α4 and α7
in YopH) constitutes an allosteric binding site [49]. An
ordered α4 helix (residues 380-383) is found to correlate
with the closure of the WPD loop, and the flexibility of
loop L6 (residues 384-392) is highly associated with the
WPD loop movements [48].
Based on these findings, we selected residues 380392 for flexible docking (Figure 5B). Our interaction
analysis, after docking, shows that the one aromatic
ring of chicoric acid interacts with Lys342 via an arenecation interaction. Gln341 and Arg278 also interact with
chicoric acid via hydrogen bonds. There are also observed
interactions between Glu276 and chicoric acid through a
water molecule.

properties of CA against HIV-1 integrase were confirmed
by computational modeling performed by one of the
co-authors of the present paper [14]. Here we described
antibacterial properties of chicoric acid against Yersinia sp.
bacteria due to decreasing the activity of YopH virulence
factor which is essential for the induction of the infection
process.
In the present paper, using both computational
modeling and experimental assays we have demonstrated
that chicoric acid can bind to two binding sites in the YopH
phosphatase enzyme and that the catalytic site is preferred.
We found that similar compounds as chlorogenic and
caffeic acids are not able to bind into second binding
site of YopH. We discovered that chicoric acid can
reduce the enzymatic activity of bacterial PTP YopH
from Y. eneterocolitica and human CD45 phosphatase.
Based on calculated IC50 values chicoric, chlorogenic
and caffeic acids for YopH and CD45 (after 15 and 30
minutes treatment), we observed higher inhibitory effect
of chicoric acid on YopH and CD45 in comparison to
chlorogenic and caffeic acids. Our results showed that
chicoric acid irreversibly inactivates YopH phosphatase.
We also found that the inhibition caused by CA is not
involved with oxidation of the catalytic cysteine. We
propose that chicoric acid induce allosteric inhibition of
YopH activity by binding and disturbing the essential
region responsible for active conformation.
Chicoric acid was already reported to allosterically
inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B [20]. The
allosteric inhibition of PTP1B activity is achieved
by perturbation along helices α3 and α6 [49], the
corresponding helices α4 and α7 in YopH are highly

DISCUSSION
Chicoric acid has been shown to have antiviral
activity [10], by inhibiting HIV integrase [11, 12, 13],
immunostimulatory properties, promoting phagocyte
activity [5]; and to inhibit hyaluronidase, a key enzyme
involved in bacterial infection [9]. The inhibitory

correlated with the motion of the WPD loop, providing
structural insights to the role of these helices in allosteric
inhibition [48].
The finding that the second substrate binding site is
correlated with the dynamics of the WPD loop via helices
α4 and α7, as well as loop L4, suggests that they are
potential allosteric binding sites for the design of novel,
selective YopH inhibitors as antibacterial agents [50].
Based on our docking and molecular dynamic simulation
results we propose that chicoric acid induces allosteric
inhibition of YopH activity by binding along the catalytic
pocket and helices α4, thus disturbing WPD loop mobility
essential for active conformation and ligand binding.

The recombinant phosphatase YopH and CD45 was
inactivated by chicoric acid and the amount of modified
YopH and CD45 thiol adduct with NBD (Cys-S-NBD
adduct) was measured after 30 minutes incubation with
NDB-Cl (0.6 mM in a 0.5 mL sample) as absorbance at
420 nm with a spectrophotometer.

Docking studies
The initial structure of YopH was imported from
the RCSB protein data bank (www.pdb.org) with code
2YDU.pdb [51]. The structure was minimized using taff.
ff forcefield of the Molecular Operating Environment
software (MOE, chemical computing group). Chain A
of this pdb file contains 306 residues. The ligand was
removed from this pdb file and chicoric, chlorogenic and
caffeic acids were docked into the structure of YopH. A
blind flexible docking simulation was performed, where
the binding site was assumed to be the entire protein.
The side chains were kept free to move during forcefield
refinement. Alpha PMI is the placement method used with
default settings (sample per conformation = 10, maximum
poses = 250). London dG rescoring was used with Alpha
PMI placement. Termination criteria for forcefield
refinement were set as gradient = 0.001 and interactions
= 500.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recombinant PTP YopH and CD45 activity assay
Bacterial recombinant YopH protein tyrosine
phosphatase from Yersinia enterocolitica was obtained
from Calbiochem. Human recombinant CD45 was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The solutions of the
recombinant PTPs were prepared in 10 mM HEPES buffer
pH 7.4. The final concentration of phosphatase in reaction
samples was 0.8 μg/mL (10 nM). The YopH and CD45
enzymes were untreated (control) or treated with solution
of chicoric, chlorogenic and caffeic acids. The assay was
performed in 96-well microplates, and the final volume
of each sample was 200 μL. The enzymatic activities of
YopH and CD45 were measured using 1 mM chromogenic
substrate para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) in 10 mM
HEPES buffer pH 7.4, at 37°C. Phosphatase hydrolyzed
pNPP to para-nitrophenol and inorganic phosphate. Paranitrophenol is an intensely yellow colored soluble product
under alkaline conditions. The increase in absorbance (due
to para-nitrophenol formation) is linearly proportional to
enzymatic activity concentration (with excessive substrate,
i.e. zero-order kinetics) and was assessed at 405 nm on
a microplate reader Jupiter (Biogenet) using DigiRead
Communication Software (Asys Hitech GmbH).

Molecular dynamics simulations
Top scoring poses from docking that interacted with
Cys403 were retained for molecular dynamics simulations
using amber12. We allowed Leap module of Amber [52]
to add missing hydrogen atoms and heavy atoms using
the Amber force field (ff10) parameters [53]. To neutralize
the charge of the system, we added sodium/chloride ions.
The model was immersed in a truncated cubical shell of
TIP3P water [54]. A time step of 2 fs and a direct-space
non-bonded cutoff of 10 Å were used. After the protein
preparation, all systems were minimized to remove
the steric clashes that occurred. The systems were then
gradually heated from 10 to 300 K over a period of 50 ps
and then maintained in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble
(NPT) at a target temperature of 300 K and a target
pressure of 1 bar using a Langevin thermostat [55, 56]
and a Berendsen barostat with a collision frequency of 2
ps and a pressure relaxation time of 1 ps, respectively. We
constrained hydrogen bonds using the SHAKE algorithm
[57]. We have used the velocity-Verlet algorithm
(default algorithm for the Amber MD package) for MD
simulations. Particle mesh Ewald (PME) procedure was
used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions using
default parameters [58]. After bringing the systems at

Reduction assay with DTT
Subsequently, recombinant phosphatase YopH that
had been previously inactivated by chicoric acid, was then
treated with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and the samples
were incubated at 37°C to reverse the inactivation, if
possible. Restoration of CD45 enzymatic activity was
measured every minute as an increase of absorbance taken
at 405 nm as described above.

a suitable temperature and pressure of 300 K and 1 bar,
respectively and equilibrating the system for 500 ps, the
