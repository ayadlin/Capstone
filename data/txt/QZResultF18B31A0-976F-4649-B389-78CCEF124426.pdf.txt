Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by
a dense stromal ﬁbroinﬂammatory reaction that is a major obstacle to effective therapy. The desmoplastic stroma comprises many
inﬂammatory cells, in particular mast cells as key components of
the PDAC microenvironment, and such inﬁltration correlates
with poor patient outcome. Indeed, it has been hypothesized
that stromal ablation is critical to improve clinical response in
patients with PDAC. Ibrutinib is a clinically approved Bruton's
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits mast cells and tumor

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer
death in the Western world and, although cancer mortality has
in general been recently improving, it has a uniquely negative
mortality trend in both sexes (1, 2). It is usually diagnosed at an
advanced stage and characterized by poor prognosis. According
to the American Cancer Society, the overall survival rates at 1
and 5 years are only 25% and 6%, respectively. The 5-year
survival for localized disease is approximately 20%, and the
median survival is 10 and 6 months for advanced and metastatic disease (which affects 80% of individuals), respectively
(www.cancernetwork.com). Hence, there is an urgent need for
new and effective therapies. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is
characterized by dense desmoplasia, composed of extracellular
matrix, endothelial cells, immune cells, ﬁbroblasts, and stellate
cells. This epithelial and stromal compartment appears to
enhance the aggressive nature of the disease and its resistance
to therapy. Indeed, the dense stromal ﬁbroinﬂammatory reac nia,

progression in a mouse model of b-cell tumorigenesis. Here, we
show that ibrutinib is highly effective at limiting the growth of
PDAC in both transgenic mouse and patient-derived xenograft
models of the disease. In these various experimental settings,
ibrutinib effectively diminished ﬁbrosis, extended survival, and
improved the response to clinical standard-of-care therapy. Our
results offer a preclinical rationale to immediately evaluate
the clinical efﬁcacy of ibrutinib in patients with PDAC. Cancer

tion results in decreased blood supply, poor drug delivery (3),
and hypoxia (4). Hence, therapies targeting the stroma may be
key to improving the clinical outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer.
Analysis of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) samples reported that mast cell inﬁltration correlated
with higher tumor grade and worse survival (5), and high mast
cell numbers at the intratumoral border correlated with the
presence of lymphatic and microvascular invasion, as well as
with lymph node metastasis (6). We have previously utilized a
mouse model of pancreatic b-cell tumorigenesis to show that
mast cells are required for angiogenesis and the macroscopic
expansion and maintenance of tumors (7), thereby proposing
mast cell targeting as a therapeutic strategy in such tumors.
Since then, other groups have shown that this role for mast cells
might be conserved in PDAC. For example, an inﬂux of mast
cells was observed in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer
expressing high levels of KRASG12V (8) and, importantly, pancreatic tumors orthotopically transplanted in mast cell-deﬁcient
mice grew more slowly than in control mice (8), conferring a
survival advantage compared with tumors grown in mast cell
proﬁcient animals.
PCI-32765 (also known as ibrutinib) is a novel inhibitor of
Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) approved for the treatment of
mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
patients who have received at least one previous therapy, and CLL
patients with 17p deletion (9). It is known to be capable of
inhibiting mast cell or basophil degranulation (10). Recently, we
validated ibrutinib as a potent systemic mast cell blocker in our
mouse model of insulinoma, triggering collapse of tumor vasculature and tumor regression (11). Hence, in the present study, we
sought to investigate the potential therapeutic impact of ibrutinib
in a preclinical model of PDAC.

Materials and Methods
IHC and collagen staining
For IHC analyses, tissue samples were ﬁxed overnight in neutral
pH–buffered formalin, embedded in parafﬁn, and sectioned
(5 mm). Sections were then deparafﬁnized, rehydrated, and microwaved for 1 minute in 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
for antigen retrieval. Primary antibodies [rat monoclonal anti–
CD11b (clone M1/70), eBioscience; rabbit polyclonal antiCD11b, Novus Biologicals; rat monoclonal anti-F4/80 (clone
CI:A3-1); rabbit monoclonal anti-Ki-67 (clone SP6), Neomarkers]
were applied for 2 hours in blocking buffer (2.5% BSA, 5% goat
serum, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS), followed by Vectastain
ABC kit and DAB reagents (Vector Laboratories). We identiﬁed
mast cells by using 1% toluidine blue dissolved in ethanol.
Picrosirius Red Stain Kit (Polysciences, Inc.) was used to stain
for collagen types I and III according to manufacturer instructions.
Images were obtained with an Axiovert S100 TV inverted ﬂuorescence microscope (Zeiss) and Open Lab 3.5.1 software, with an
Axiovert 100 inverted microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca digital camera or with an Olympus FSX100 microscope and FSX-BSW software.
Flow cytometry
Following resection, PDAC tumors isolated from PBS-perfused
mice were immediately placed in ice-cold PBS, followed by
manual mincing using scissors and a 20-minute enzymatic digestion with 1.25 mg/mL collagenase type IV (Roche), 0.1% trypsin
inhibitor, and 50 U/mL DNase I (Roche) in serum-free DMEM
(Life Technologies) at 37 C with continuous stirring. Single cell
suspensions were then prepared by passing tissue through 70 mm
nylon strainers (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated for 30
minutes at 4o C with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 mAb (1:250,
clone 2.4G2, BD Bioscience) in PBS, which also contained Live/
Dead Aqua stain (1:250, Invitrogen) to differentiate between
viable and dead cells. Cells were then incubated for 30 minutes
in PBS containing 1.0% BSA (Sigma) and 2 mmol/L EDTA
with 100 mL of ﬂuorophore-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies
(dilution; clone): PE-Cy7-CD45 (1:800; 30-F11), PerCp-Cy5.5CD3e (1:400; 145-2C11), PerCp-Cy5.5-CD19 (1:200; 6D5),
PerCp-Cy5.5-CD49b (1:400; DX5), Alexa 700-CD11b (1:400;
M1/70), APC780-CD11c (1:200; N418), eFluor450-MHCII
(1:800; M5/114.15.2), APC-Ly6C (1:800; HK1.4), PE-Ly6G
(1:400; 1A8), and PE-Cy5-F4/80 (1:400; BM8; eBioscience or
Biolegend). Cells were then washed once in PBS containing
1.0% BSA (Sigma) and 2 mmol/L EDTA, followed by ﬁxation
with BD Cytoﬁx for 30 minutes on ice. Following a ﬁnal wash, the
cells were stored at 4 C until data acquisition using a LSRII using
FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Analysis was performed
using FlowJo software program (Tree Star Inc).
Animal studies
All the animal studies were performed in accordance with the
ARRIVE guidelines and the 3 Rs rule of Replacement, Reduction
and Reﬁnement principles.
Mice were housed and treated following the protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at the University of California, San Francisco (San Francisco, CA)
and by the CEEA (Ethical Committee for the Use of Experimental
Animals) at the Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology, Barcelona,
Spain. Mouse weights were recorded for every experiment (Supplementary Fig. S1).

LSLKRasG12D;Pdx1-cre [Krastm4Tyj; Tg(Ipf1-cre)1Tuv] and
p53ER/ER [Trp53tm1Gev] mice have been previously described
(12–14). For all experiments, 8-week-old male and female
p53ER/ER;LSLKRasG12D;Pdx1-cre mice of mixed C57BL/6-FVB/N
background were randomized into two groups: treated and
control. Ibrutinib (0.16 mg/mL with 1% 2-Hydroxypropylbeta-cyclodextrin; HP-b-CD) was added to the drinking water of
treated animals, and control animals received water containing
vehicle only (1% HP-b-CD). Vehicle or ibrutinib dissolved in
water were both consumed at approximately 5.5 mL per day, in
accordance with the reported typical daily water intake (15).
Gemcitabine (75 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally twice a
week for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period. Sodium
cromoglycate (10 mg/kg) was dissolved in saline solution and
injected intraperitoneally, and control mice were treated with
vehicle only. Endpoint criteria were deﬁned as 20% body weight
loss in addition to general morbidity and lethargy caused by
tumor burden. Mice euthanized due to intestinal metaplasia or
mucocutaneous papillomas caused by extrapancreatic KRASG12D
expression were excluded from the survival study.
NOD/SCID mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratory. The anonymized human sample used was part of the tissue
biologic material of the University Hospital Vall d'Hebron. The
sample had been collected with a signed patient consent form and
its use had been approved by the Ethics Committee (CEI) of the
Hospital. The sample was randomly selected among the patient
samples available. Heterotopic xenografts were generated from a
tumor biopsy of a patient that underwent pancreatectomy at
University Hospital Vall d'Hebron: when routine pathologic gross
examination of a resected pancreas led to the detection of an
adenocarcinoma, a slice with a thickness of 1 to 2 mm was
transferred to RPMI-1640 media containing Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco) and kept on ice; within approximately 30 minutes,
the tissue sample was cut into pieces of 15 mm3 under sterile
conditions, suspended in Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and transported to the SPF area of the animal facility. A tumor piece was
implanted subcutaneously into the ﬂank of 2 to 3 female 6-weekold NOD/SCID mice. When successfully grafted tumors reached a
size of about 750 mm3, they were transplanted. The xenograft
used for the study described here was transplanted to 6-week-old
NOD/SCID females in generation 4, which after 6 weeks had
produced a cohort of 28 mice with tumors measurable by caliper.
Animals were randomized into two groups, 1 treated with ibrutinib and the other untreated. Tumor size was evaluated weekly by
caliper measurements and tumor volume calculated using the
following formula:
volume ¼

length  width2
2

When tumor volume reached 1,500 mm3, animals were euthanized and the tumor was collected and ﬁxed overnight in neutral
pH–buffered formalin.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out by two-tailed Mann–Whitney test (for IHC counts), two-tailed unpaired t test (for ﬂowcytometric data), c2 test of homogeneity (for collagen staining),
and log-rank test (for Kaplan–Meier survival curves). SE (SEM)
and SD (SD) are either represented in the graphs or following
the means of all measures, as stated in ﬁgure legends. Statistical
analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.

vehicle control. No detectable side effects of the treatment were
observed and the animals did not lose weight throughout
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The animals were euthanized 4
weeks later and their pancreata harvested for analysis. As
expected, mast cells were still recruited to the tumor stroma,
but their degranulation was efﬁciently inhibited by ibrutinib
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Strikingly, tumors treated with ibrutinib displayed a signiﬁcant reduction in proliferation rate (Fig. 1A; 67.8  29.5% Ki-67 positive in untreated
vs. 14.9  7.0% treated animals). CD11b-positive cells, as
well as F4/80-positive macrophages were both reduced as
shown by IHC and FACS analysis (Fig. 1B and C). However,
the most striking change induced by ibrutinib treatment was
on tumor ﬁbrosis, reﬂected by collagen deposition as detected
by Picrosirius Red staining. Treatment with ibrutinib dramatically reduced the amount of collagen present in the tumors
(Fig. 1D and E).
The antiﬁbrotic effect of ibrutinib is mast cell dependent
To verify that this effect on ﬁbrosis was speciﬁcally due to mast
cell interference, we ﬁrst asked whether ibrutinib could have any
direct activity on tumor cells per se. To address this question, we
made use of four different pancreatic cancer cell lines and treated
them with increasing amounts of ibrutinib in vitro, following their
number over time. We chose four cell lines presenting a similar

1678 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

mutational proﬁle to the one displayed by our mouse model (i.e.,
KRAS and p53 mutation): MIA PaCa-2, YAPC, PSN-1, and PA-TU8988T. Importantly, none responded signiﬁcantly to the treatment, pointing to the activity of ibrutinib on tumor stroma—
rather than a direct effect on pancreatic cell survival—as the best
candidate for ibrutinib's anti-tumorigenic effect in PDAC (Supplementary Fig. S3).
With this line of reasoning in mind and to verify the hypothesis
that mast cell interference played a role in the antiﬁbrotic effect
displayed by ibrutinib, we performed two independent control
experiments. In the ﬁrst one, we made use of sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn), a well-characterized blocker of mast cell degranulation and inﬂammogen release (7, 17). We treated the p53ER/ER;
LSLKRasG12D;Pdx1-cre mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a daily
injection of 10 mg per kg (bodyweight) of cromolyn, starting at
8 weeks of age. The animals were euthanized 4 weeks later and
their pancreata analyzed. We veriﬁed that cromolyn treatment
blocked degranulation (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Strikingly,
treatment with cromolyn recapitulated the antiﬁbrotic effect displayed by ibrutinib (Fig. 2A and B). Once again, this effect was
accompanied by a reduction in F4/80þ cells and a signiﬁcant
decrease in CD11bþ cells in the tumor stroma (Fig. 2C and D).
Although cromolyn was also described to display some cytotoxic
effect on pancreatic cancer cells (18), the overlapping effect of
ibrutinib and cromolyn on collagen deposition strongly suggests

that mast cell inhibition is the most likely explanation for this
phenomenon. This ﬁnding is consistent with the recently published work showing that mast cells could exacerbate the cellular
and extracellular dynamics of the tumor microenvironment
found in PDAC (19).
In a second set of experiments, we made use of subcutaneous
patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of a patient-derived tumor in
NOD/SCID mice (Fig. 3). These mice are defective for both Band T-cell function. Once again, ibrutinib prevented mast cell
degranulation (Supplementary Fig. S2C) and led to a striking
reduction in tissue ﬁbrosis detected by Picrosirius Red staining
(Fig. 3A and B), excluding B- and T-cell signaling modulation as
ibrutinib's main mechanism of action in this context. The
animals also showed a signiﬁcant survival advantage when
treated with ibrutinib compared with untreated littermates
(Fig. 3C). Interestingly, IHC analysis of F4/80 and CD11b-

positive cells showed a slight but nonsigniﬁcant reduction of
both cell types (Fig. 3D and E).
These experimental models combined point to mast cells as
crucial players in stimulating collagen deposition, in line with
previously published data showing that mast cell tryptase might
sustain liver ﬁbrosis by promoting stellate cell proliferation and
collagen synthesis (20) and with the concept that mast cells could
be the culprit in various ﬁbrotic diseases (21, 22).
Ibrutinib is an effective therapy and improves the outcome of
standard care in a transgenic mouse model of PDAC
In PDAC, dense stromal ﬁbrosis is a considerable obstacle to
therapeutic intervention. Consequently, we hypothesized that the
antiﬁbrotic effect of ibrutinib represented a promising therapeutic
opportunity. We therefore performed two independent survival
experiments in the p53ER/ER;LSLKRasG12D;Pdx1-cre mouse model:

the ﬁrst one sought to explore the therapeutic impact of ibrutinib
alone and the second one to assess ibrutinib in combination with
gemcitabine, the best characterized therapy available to pancreatic
cancer patients during the past decade. As monotherapy, ibrutinib
conferred a signiﬁcant survival advantage to treated mice compared with untreated controls (Fig. 4A). In the second experiment,
gemcitabine alone resulted in slight toxicity, although ibrutinib
ameliorated the toxicity and signiﬁcantly extended survival compared with gemcitabine alone (Fig. 4B), conﬁrming our hypothesis that the standard-of-care outcome can be improved by the
addition of ibrutinib.

Discussion
Our work provides preclinical evidence for the use of ibrutinib,
which is already approved for clinical use, in the treatment of
PDAC, based on the observed systemic mast cell inhibitory effects
of ibrutinib as a potentially new and potent antiﬁbrotic drug. In
line with our results, it has been shown that ibrutinib speciﬁcally
inhibits the release of IL8, MPC-1, and TNFa from mast cells (10).
All these factors have a known role in ﬁbrosis: IL8 is elevated in the
serum of idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis patients (23) and correlates with the degree of ﬁbrosis in infants with chronic liver disease
(24); MCP-1 is a key determinant in the development of skin
ﬁbrosis, it could inﬂuence collagen ﬁber formation in mice (25)
and is involved in the development of interstitial ﬁbrosis in a
mouse model of crescentic nephritis (26); ﬁnally, TNFa, which
has a controversial role in ﬁbrotic disease (27), promotes survival

1680 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

of activated hepatic stellate cells in vitro and in vivo, increases liver
ﬁbrosis in mice (28), mediates the transition from pulmonary
inﬂammation to ﬁbrosis (29) and its inhibition reduces ﬁbrosis in
a mouse model of autoimmune thyroiditis (30). Therefore, in
addition to its beneﬁcial role in reducing tumor ﬁbrosis, the use of
ibrutinib could potentially be extended to the treatment of
various ﬁbrotic diseases, such as liver ﬁbrosis (31) or chronic
pancreatitis (32).
The decrease in the leukocytic component of the tumor microenvironment (CD11b-positive cells and F4/80-positive macrophages) after treatment with ibrutinib and cromolyn could be
explained by the fact that several chemokines produced by mast
cells, such as IL6, are known to be potent stimulants for monocytic
cell migration and macrophage activation (33), so that inhibiting
mast cells could prevent their recruitment.
Intriguingly, recent work suggests that ibrutinib could be redeployed to treat lung cancer owing to inhibitory activity against the
EGFR (34). However, EGFR mutations are not frequent in PDAC
and none of our experimental systems presented EGFR alterations
(data not shown).
It remains possible that additional anti-inﬂammatory effects of
ibrutinib (speciﬁcally inhibition of B-cell signaling) might contribute to its therapeutic impact and modulation of other inﬂammatory components, even though we have demonstrated that
such signaling is not required for decreased ﬁbrosis. Further study
of the effect of ibrutinib on other members of the complex PDAC
stroma will be required to fully characterize its precise mechanism
of action.
