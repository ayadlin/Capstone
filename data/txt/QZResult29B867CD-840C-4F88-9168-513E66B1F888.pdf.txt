Abstract
Mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS), a transforming growth
factor-B family member, activates the nuclear factor-KB (NFKB) pathway and induces the expression of B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2), IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), and the
chemokine Gro-B. Inhibiting NF-KB activation with a phosphorylation-deficient IKBA mutant abrogated MIS-mediated
induction of all three genes. Expression of dominant-negative
Smad1, in which serines at the COOH-terminal SSVS motif are
converted to alanines, suppressed MIS-induced Smad1 phosphorylation and impaired MIS-stimulated Gro-B promoterdriven reporter expression and Gro-B mRNA. Suppressing
Smad1 expression using small interfering RNA also mitigated
MIS-induced Gro-B mRNA, suggesting that regulation of Gro-B
expression by MIS was dependent on activation of NF-KB as
well as Smad1. However, induction of IRF-1 and BTG2 mRNAs
by MIS was independent of Smad1 activation. Characterization of KB-binding sequences within Gro-B, BTG2, and IRF-1
promoters showed that MIS stimulated binding of p50 and p65
subunits to all three sites, whereas phosphorylated Smad1
(phospho-Smad1) protein was detectable only in the NF-KB
complex bound to the KB site of the Gro-B promoter.
Consistent with these observations, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed recruitment of both phospho-Smad1
and p65 to the Gro-B promoter in vivo, whereas p65, but not
phospho-Smad1, was recruited to the BTG2 promoter. These
results show a novel interaction between MIS-stimulated
Smad1 and NF-KB signaling in which enhancement of NF-KB
DNA binding and gene expression by phospho-Smad1 is
dependent on the sequence of the KB consensus site within
the promoter. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2747–56]

Introduction
Mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) induces regression of the
Mullerian duct in male embryos (1). The presence of MIS receptors
in the mammary gland and prostate (2, 3) suggests that these
tissues are likely targets for MIS action. MIS inhibits breast and
prostate cancer cell growth through a nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)dependent mechanism (2, 3). The NF-nB family of transcriptional
activators, p65, p50, p52, c-rel, and RelB, shares a rel homology

domain. NF-nB in its inactive state exists in the cytosol bound to
inhibitory InB molecules. Activation of the pathway leads to
phosphorylation and degradation of InB with subsequent nuclear
localization of NF-nB (4–6). The InB kinase (IKK) complex
consisting of IKKa and IKKh, two protein kinases with high
degree of sequence similarity, and the regulatory subunit IKKg
(NF-nB essential modulator), mediates site-specific phosphorylation of InB proteins (7–9). On nuclear import, homodimeric or
heterodimeric NF-nB transactivators bind to decameric DNA
consensus motifs to activate transcription.
The nB sites within promoters of NF-nB–responsive genes do
not display a strict consensus (10). However, the sequence of nB
sites within a given gene is evolutionarily well conserved (11),
suggesting that the nB sequence may play a critical role in defining
gene activation by NF-nB. A strict sequence requirement for NF-nB
inducibility is observed in the nB site within the IFN-h promoter
(GGGAAATTCC), which when substituted by a closely related nB
site from the Ign light gene enhancer (GGGACTTTCC) becomes
nonresponsive to NF-nB activation (12). Structural studies revealed
that differences in nB sequences of IFN-h and the Ign light chain
gene enhancers contribute to structural changes in the NF-nB
dimer/DNA complex, leading to altered gene expression (13, 14).
Leung et al. (11) showed that the nB site sequence specifies which
coactivators will result in productive interactions with bound
NF-nB dimers. BRCA1 (15), IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3, Bcl-3 (11),
and HMG 1(Y) (16) are some of the cofactors reported to regulate
NF-nB activity. Deciphering the cues provided by the nB sites to
specify NF-nB subunit and cofactor requirement in stimulusspecific gene expression is an area of active investigation.
MIS, in addition to activating NF-nB, also stimulates Smad1/
5/8 phosphorylation; phosphorylated (phospho) Smad1/5/8 complexes with Smad4 and localizes to the nucleus to activate transcription (17). Several lines of evidence indicate interactions between
NF-nB and Smad pathways. Transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h)
signaling is suppressed by tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), which
through NF-nB activation induces Smad7 to suppress TGF-h/Smadmediated transcription (18). Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2
and BMP-4 suppress TNF-a–induced caspase-8 activation and
apoptosis through a Smad-dependent pathway (19). In addition to
such antagonistic effects, functional cooperation between NF-nB
and Smad3 can also regulate gene expression (20). Although these
observations show a cross-talk between NF-nB and Smad pathways, a functional interaction between Smad1 phosphorylation and
NF-nB activation has never been shown.
We report that MIS and BMPs induce Gro expression in mammary epithelial cells. The Gro genes encode 8- to 10-kDa secretory
proteins and belong to a family of genes, such as platelet factor 4

and neutrophil-activating peptide/interleukin (IL)-8 (21). The three
related Gro genes, Gro-a, Gro-b, and Gro-c, which encode f1.1 kb
mRNAs, are closely linked on chromosome 4. Gro-h and Gro-g
share 90% and 86% sequence homology with Gro-a (22). The
CXCR2 receptor, a member of the serpentine receptor superfamily,
binds multiple chemokines, including Gro-h, and signals through
heterotrimeric G proteins (23).
Gro-h is constitutively expressed in normal mammary epithelial
cells, but not in most breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that it
may be a negative regulator of epithelial cell growth (24). Although
IL-1, TNF-a, and fibronectin fragments induce Gro-h through activation of NF-nB (25–27), little is known about additional mechanisms that regulate Gro-h expression. Our results show that MIS
induces Gro-h expression through a Smad1-dependent and NF-nB–
dependent mechanism defined by the sequence of the nB site in the
promoter, suggesting a novel functional interaction between Smad1
and NF-nB pathways in differential regulation of gene expression.

Materials and Methods
Reagents, cell lines, MIS production, and purification. Culture
conditions for cell lines are described (2, 3, 28). Production of human
recombinant MIS is described (29). Gro-h (human recombinant) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-6
were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). T47D and LNCaP cells stably
expressing dominant-negative InBa (InBaDN) are described (3, 30).
The dominant-negative Smad1 (Smad1DN) transgene, in which the
SSVS phosphorylation sequence was converted to AAVA, was a kind gift
from Dr. Jeffrey Wrana (Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada). Cells
expressing Smad1DN were generated by transfecting 1 Ag of hygromycin
resistance plasmid and 5 Ag Smad1DN. Cells were grown in medium
containing 100 Ag/mL hygromycin. Smad1DN-expressing clones were
identified by Northern blot and by lack of Smad1 phosphorylation following
MIS treatment. Characterization of Smad1DN-expressing LNCaP cells is
described (31).
Western blot analysis. Anti–phospho-Smad1/5/8 and anti–E-cadherin
antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) and Zymed
(South San Francisco, CA), respectively. Western protocols are as described
previously (32).
RNA analysis. Ten cases of human breast carcinoma and adjacent
matched normal tissues were obtained from the tissue bank of
Massachusetts General Hospital (Charlestown, MA) according to protocols
approved by the Human Research Committee at Massachusetts General
Hospital. The expressed sequence tag clones to detect human Gro-h, IRF-1,
B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2), and Smad1 were purchased from Incyte
Genomics, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Northern blot was done as described (33).
To block Smad1 expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA), cells
were transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); 8 AL siRNA
(20 Amol/L) and 6 AL Oligofectamine were diluted with 132 and 34 AL of
Opti-MEM, respectively. After 5 min, they were combined and incubated
for 15 min. Reaction mixtures were overlaid on cells for 24 h. MIS was added
for 2 h and RNA was extracted. The siRNA against human Smad1, CAGGACUUUGUGUACAGUUAA, and control siRNA, AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU, was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The following primers
were used to amplify cDNAs: Smad1, 5¶-ACTTGACCTCTGTGACCAACTG-3¶
(sense) and 5¶-GCTTGGCCATCTCTCCTTTA-3¶ (antisense; generated a
191-bp fragment); Gro-h, 5¶-CCCCGAATTCACGGAGCTCCTTGCCAGCTCT-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-CCCCCTCGAGCCTTCAGGAACAGCCACCAATAAG-3¶
(antisense; generated a 422-bp fragment); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5¶-CCAGTCAGGGAGGAAATAAAGCC-3¶ (sense)
and 5¶-GATGCGTCCAAATCCATTGATGCC-3¶ (antisense).
RNase protection assay. The primers used to generate Gro-a were
CCCC(GAATTC)CCAGTAGGACAAACAGCAACAGG ( forward) and
CCCC(CTCGAG)TTCAGGAACAGCCACCAGTGAG (reverse). The primers
used to generate Gro-h were CCCC(GAATTC)TCAAACCCAAGTTAGTT-

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

CAATCCTG ( forward) and CCCC(CTCGAG)ATAGACACACATACATTTCCCTGCC (reverse). The sequences within parentheses in forward and
reverse primers represent EcoR1 and Xho1 restriction sites, respectively.
cDNA generated from MIS-treated T47D cells was used for PCR
amplification. The Gro-a and Gro-h primers gave rise to 330- and 192-bp
fragments, respectively, which were cloned into EcoR1 and Xho1 sites of
pCDNA3.1( ). Constructs were sequenced to confirm insert boundaries and
linearized with HinDIII. Antisense transcripts were obtained using T7
polymerase (MAXIscript In Vitro Transcription kit, Ambion, Austin, TX).
RNase protection assays were done as described (28).
NF-KB electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Protocols for gel shifts
are described (2). Supershifts were done by adding 1 to 2 Ag of rabbit antip65 or p50 antibodies to binding reactions. To detect phospho-Smad1 in
complexes bound to the NF-nB site, 4 AL of phospho-Smad1 antibody were
added to reactions. The phospho-Smad1 antibody supplied by Cell Signaling
Technology was at a concentration of 0.055 Ag/AL. Therefore, the amount of
phospho-Smad1 used in gel shift was f18-fold lower compared with the
concentrated p50 and p65 antibodies (1–2 Ag/AL; TransCruz, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) specifically designed for use in gel shifts.
The sense and antisense oligonucleotides containing nB sites in Gro-h,
IRF-1, and BTG2 promoters were annealed, radiolabeled, and used as
probes for gel shifts. The nB sequence within each oligonucleotide is
italicized: Gro-h, 5¶-GAGCTCCGGGAATTTCC CTGG-3¶ (sense); mutant
Gro-h, 5¶-GAGCTCCGGGCACTTCC CTGG-3¶ (sense); IRF-1, 5¶-CAGGGCTGGGGAATCCCGCTA-3¶ (sense); BTG2, 5¶-GCTGCCCGGGGAAAGTCCGGG-3¶ (sense); and Ign light chain gene enhancer (Promega, Madison, WI),
5¶-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3¶ (sense).
The cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins of untreated and MIS-treated cells
were analyzed by Western blot to assess nuclear localization of p65.
Luciferase assays. Cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with
0.18 Ag of BMP response element (BRE)-driven luciferase; Renilla luciferase
(0.006 Ag) was used to control for transfection efficiency. After 48 h, cells
were treated with 1 ng/mL BMP-2 for 6 h and assayed for luciferase activity
(n = 4).
Gro-h promoter-luciferase constructs were derived from Gro-h promoter-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) constructs described in ref. 26.
Briefly, the 500-bp fragment containing the promoter region of Gro-h
between nucleotides 428 and +76 (designated SS1), the 150-bp fragment
containing nucleotides 80 to +76 (designated SS2), and a deletion
fragment containing a mutation within the NF-nB site located within 76
and 67 (designated SS4) were released from Gro-h-CAT constructs with
Xba1 and HinDIII and cloned between Nhe1 and HinDIII sites of the pGL3basic luciferase construct (Promega). To determine the effect of Smad1 on
Gro-h transactivation, Gro-h-luciferase constructs (0.18 Ag) were transfected into cells; 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with 35 nmol/L
MIS for 6 h and luciferase activity was measured (n = 6). Renilla luciferase
(0.006 Ag) was used to control for transfection efficiency.
To ensure that loss of MIS-inducible Gro-h promoter activity in
Smad1DN-expressing cells did not result from clonal variation, transient
transfections were done. Cells were transfected with 0.18 Ag of Gro-h
promoter-luciferase and either (0.18 Ag) vector or (0.18 Ag) Smad1DN
construct and analyzed as described above (n = 6).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were done as described in ref. 34 with some
modifications. Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for
15 min. Cross-linker was quenched using 0.125 mol/L glycine. Cells were lysed
in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and sonicated. Chromatin was
immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti–
phospho-Smad1/5/8 antibodies overnight at 4jC. Anti–green fluorescent
protein (GFP; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as control. Antibody
complexes were incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4jC, washed
five times, and eluted with 0.1% SDS/0.1 mol/L NaHCO3. NaCl was added
to a final concentration of 200 mmol/L. Eluates were reverse cross-linked
at 65jC for 6 h. DNA was precipitated with ethanol overnight. Following
RNase A and proteinase K treatment, DNA was reprecipitated and analyzed
by PCR. ‘‘Input’’ templates were purified from 10% of the original lysates.

regions containing nB-binding sites are the following: Gro-h, 5¶-CTCCGGGAATTTCCCT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TCAGCAGGCGGTTCGAGCGGCTG-3¶

Results
Gro-B expression is induced by MIS and BMPs. Gro-b was
identified as a target gene induced by MIS in human breast cancer
cells using a HG-U95Av2 oligonucleotide array. To validate this
observation further, estrogen receptor–positive human breast
cancer cell line, T47D, nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial
cell line, MCF10A, primary human prostate epithelial cells, PrEC,
and prostate cancer cell line, DU145, were treated with MIS. MIS
induced Gro mRNA in all cell lines following 1 to 2 h of treatment;
expression remained elevated above basal levels at later time
points (Fig. 1A).
Because Gro-h is highly homologous to Gro-a, RNase protection
assays were done to determine whether MIS was inducing Gro-h

and/or Gro-a transcripts. The Gro-h probe protected by the
transcript was 83 bp shorter than the full-length probe due to
unrelated sequences at the 5¶ and 3¶ ends. The Gro-a fragment has a
HinDIII site around position 226 of its sequence. Thus, the protected
Gro-a fragment was 42 bp shorter than the full-length probe due to
unrelated sequences at the 5¶ end. The 192-bp Gro-h probe protected
by Gro-h mRNA was induced by MIS, whereas the 226-bp Gro-a
fragment protected by Gro-a mRNA was barely detectable in T47D
cells before or after MIS treatment (Fig. 1B), suggesting that MIS was
predominantly inducing Gro-h in breast cancer cells. We examined
Gro-g expression using PCR analysis and observed that it was
neither detectable nor induced in the cell types analyzed.
In addition to MIS, BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-6 also up-regulated
Gro mRNA expression in MCF10A cells although with different
kinetics. BMP-2 and BMP-6 strongly induced Gro as early as 1 h and
enhanced levels persisted for up to 24 h (Fig. 1C, top). BMP-4
suppressed Gro mRNA at early time points, but expression was
induced above basal level at 24 h (Fig. 1C, bottom). To identify
whether BMPs were inducing Gro-a or Gro-h, RNase protection
assays were done. Unlike MIS, BMP-2 induced both Gro-a and

Gro-h in MCF10A cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, Gro-h expression in mammary epithelial cells may be under the regulation of multiple
TGF-h family members.
MIS-induced Gro-B expression is dependent on activation of
NF-KB and Smad pathways. Gro-h expression in cells is reported
to be dependent on NF-nB activation (26, 27), and MIS strongly
induces NF-nB activity in breast and prostate cancer cells (2, 3, 28).
Therefore, we tested whether stimulation of Gro-h by MIS was
mediated through NF-nB activation. Characterization of T47D
cells expressing InBaDN has been described (30). Stimulation of
Gro-h by MIS was mitigated in T47D cells expressing InBaDN,
suggesting that NF-nB activation was required for this process
(Fig. 2A).
Because MIS signaling is also transmitted through phosphorylation of Smad1 (17), we tested whether Smad1 phosphorylation
plays a role in Gro-h induction. Cells were transfected with
Smad1DN, in which three conserved serine residues at the COOHterminal SSVS motif are converted to alanines. Two T47D clones
stably expressing Smad1DN were identified by Northern blot
(Fig. 2B). To ensure that Smad1DN transgene was functioning as a
dominant negative, we transfected vector and Smad1DN-expressing T47D cells with BRE-luciferase. BMP-2 induced BRE-luciferase
in vector-transfected cells, an effect suppressed by Smad1DN
(Fig. 2C), suggesting that the Smad1DN transgene was indeed
functioning as a dominant negative. Western blot analysis showed
that MIS induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation in T47D cells by
0.5 to 1 h of treatment, an effect readily visible following 6 h of
exposure (Fig. 2D, top); Smad1DN suppressed MIS-mediated
phosphorylation of Smad1 (Fig. 2D, bottom).
Induction of Gro-h by MIS was decreased in T47D cells
expressing Smad1DN compared with vector-transfected controls
(Fig. 3A). To ensure that lack of Gro-h induction in Smad1DNexpressing cells was not due to Smad1 overexpression interfering
with other functions, we used RNA interference to block Smad1.
siRNA specific for Smad1 resulted in significant reduction in Smad1
mRNA expression compared with cells transfected with control
siRNA (Fig. 3B, left). Induction of Gro-h by MIS was not affected in
cells transfected with control siRNA, whereas loss of Smad1 led to
ablation of MIS-mediated Gro-h induction (Fig. 3B, right).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

We then determined whether Smad1 exerts its effects through the
NF-nB site in the Gro-h promoter. Characterization of Gro-h
promoter used in this assay is described (26). Vector and Smad1DNexpressing cells were transfected with Gro-h promoter-luciferase
constructs, SS1, SS2, and SS4, described in Materials and Methods.
MIS stimulated luciferase activity from SS1- and SS2-driven
reporters but not from the reporter driven by SS4 in which the
NF-nB site was mutated. However, none of the Gro-h promoters
were responsive to MIS in Smad1DN-expressing clones. Therefore,
decrease in MIS-stimulated Smad1 phosphorylation in breast cancer
cells was associated with lack of MIS-induced Gro-h promoter
activation, which occurs through the nB site in the promoter
(Fig. 3C). To rule out the possibility of clonal variation, responsiveness of the Gro-h promoter constructs to MIS was analyzed
following transient transfections. The results obtained were
consistent with the results observed in T47D cells that stably
expressed Smad1DN (Fig. 3D).
To ensure that these observations were not limited to a single
cell line, we tested MIS-induced Gro-h expression in the human
prostate cancer cell line LNCaP stably expressing InBaDN and
Smad1DN. Characterization of these cells is described (3, 31). As
with T47D cells, InBaDN and Smad1DN expression in LNCaP cells
suppressed Gro-h induction by MIS (Fig. 3E). Therefore, Gro-h
induction by MIS requires activation of both NF-nB and Smad1.
Activation of NF-KB by phospho-Smad1 is dependent on
sequence of the KB site. MIS induces IRF-1 and BTG2 expression
in breast cancer cells through a NF-nB–dependent mechanism
(30, 33). To determine whether Smad1 activation is required for
MIS-mediated stimulation of IRF-1 and BTG2, vector and
Smad1DN-expressing cells were treated with MIS and analyzed
for IRF-1 and BTG2 expression. Both IRF-1 and BTG2 mRNA were
induced to similar levels in both vector and Smad1DN-expressing
cells (Fig. 4A), indicating that Smad1 activation was not required
for this process.
To further characterize this observation, sequence of the nB sites
within IRF-1, BTG2, and Gro-h promoters was surveyed (Fig. 4B).
Because sequences of NF-nB–binding sites within the three
promoters were not identical, we analyzed whether blocking MISinduced Smad1 phosphorylation would affect binding of NF-nB

proteins to these sites. Both vector and Smad1DN-expressing cells
were treated with MIS for 1 h, and nuclear proteins were analyzed
by gel shift. MIS induced NF-nB binding to all three NF-nB sites
(Fig. 4C–E). Expression of Smad1DN abrogated MIS-stimulated
NF-nB binding to the nB site derived from Gro-h promoter (Fig. 4C)
but did not affect binding to sequences derived from IRF-1 and
BTG2 promoters (Fig. 4D and E).
We next investigated whether phospho-Smad1 was present
within the p50, p65 complex that binds to nB sequences.
Preincubation of nuclear lysates with phospho-Smad1 antibody
led to a 80% reduction in DNA binding to the nB sequence derived
from Gro-h promoter, suggesting that phospho-Smad1 was a
component of the complex bound to this sequence (Fig. 4C).
Conversion of two nucleotides within NF-nB sequence of the Gro-h
promoter abrogated binding, confirming that protein-DNA complex detected in gel shift assays was indeed occurring through the

nB site (Fig. 4C). However, phospho-Smad1 was not a component
of the NF-nB complex bound to nB sites derived from IRF-1 and
BTG2 promoters (Fig. 4D and E).
To characterize the sequence requirement of the Gro-h nB site
that renders Smad1 responsiveness, we analyzed NF-nB binding to
the n light chain enhancer nB site, which differs from the Gro-h
NF-nB site by a single nucleotide. MIS-induced NF-nB complex that
bound to this site contained both p65 and p50 subunits. The
phospho-Smad1 antibody decreased the band intensity compared
with control. Moreover, NF-nB binding to this site was decreased
in Smad1DN-expressing clones compared with that observed in
control cells (Fig. 4F). Overall nB site sequence comparison of Gro-h,
BTG2, IRF-1, and Ign light chain enhancer genes suggests that two
T residues (italicized) within the Gro-h nB site (GGGAATTTCC) are
important to confer Smad1 responsiveness to the Gro-h promoter
(Fig. 4B).

Figure 4. NF-nB activation by phospho-Smad1 is dependent on sequence of the nB-binding site. A, induction of IRF-1 and BTG2 by MIS is NF-nB dependent but is
not dependent on Smad1 activation. Vector and InBaDN- or Smad1DN-expressing T47D cells were treated with MIS for 2 h and RNA was analyzed for IRF-1 and
BTG2 expression. B, sequences of the nB-binding sites within Gro-h, Ign light chain enhancer, IRF-1, and BTG2. x, sequence variation(s) from the Gro-h nB site.

P-labeled NF-nB DNA-binding oligonucleotide probe derived from the IRF-1 promoter and separated on nondenaturing gels. In both experiments (D and E),
T47D cells were treated with 35 nmol/L MIS for 1 h. Nuclear proteins were incubated with TransCruz p50 and p65 or phospho-Smad1 antibodies before addition
of radiolabeled probe. Open arrows, positions of DNA-NF-nB protein complexes and supershifted complexes. F, control and Smad1DN-expressing T47D cells were
treated with 35 nmol/L MIS for 1 h. Nuclear proteins were preincubated with indicated amounts of antibody overnight at 4jC, mixed with 32P-labeled NF-nB DNA-binding
oligonucleotide derived from the Ign light chain enhancer (Promega), and separated on a nondenaturing gel. Arrow, positions of DNA-NF-nB protein complexes and

Retention of p65 in the nucleus is impaired in Smad1DNexpressing T47D cells. To analyze the role of Smad1 phosphorylation in NF-nB activation, vector and Smad1DN-expressing T47D
cells were treated with MIS for 30 and 60 min and nuclear
localization of p65 was analyzed by Western blot. MIS enhanced
the nuclear localization of p65 in control and Smad1DN-expressing
cells. In Smad1DN-expressing cells, p65 localized to the nucleus
after 30 min of exposure to MIS; levels returned to the basal state
after 60 min. However, MIS-induced p65 nuclear localization

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

occurred at 60 min in control cells (Fig. 5A). To determine whether
p65 continues to be retained in the nuclei of control cells, we
treated the cells with MIS for 2 h. MIS induced nuclear localization
of p65 in control cells, but no difference in nuclear p65 expression
was observed in Smad1DN-expressing cells. The blots were probed
for tubulin and c-myc to ensure that the cytoplasmic fraction did
not contaminate the nuclear fraction (Fig. 5B). These results
indicate that loss of Smad1 activation impairs nuclear retention of
p65 following MIS treatment.

MIS-Induced Phospho-Smad1 Activates NF-kB

Phospho-Smad1 and p65 are bound to Gro-B promoter
in vivo. Because gel shifts suggest that phospho-Smad1 is a
component of the complex bound to the nB site derived from Gro-h
promoter, we used ChIP assays to characterize the association
of p65 and phospho-Smad1 with BTG2 and Gro-h promoters.
Untreated and MIS-treated T47D cells were cross-linked and
chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-p65, anti–phosphoSmad1, and anti-GFP antibodies. DNA eluted from immune
complexes was analyzed by PCR using gene-specific primers
flanking the nB sites in Gro-h and BTG2 promoters. PCR analysis
using primers specific for BTG2 promoter amplified the BTG2
promoter from DNA immunoprecipitated by anti-p65 but not anti–
phospho-Smad1 antibody, suggesting that phospho-Smad1 was not
a component of the NF-nB complex bound to this region (Fig. 6A).
MIS induced the binding of both p65 and phospho-Smad1 to
the Gro-h promoter fragment containing the nB site (Fig. 6B). The
PCR fragments were purified and sequenced to confirm that it
matched the sequence of Gro-h and BTG2 promoters (data not
shown). To determine whether the lack of Gro-h induction in
Smad1DN and InBaDN clones correlated with the lack of p65 and
phospho-Smad1 binding to the Gro-h promoter, ChIP was carried
out with untreated and MIS-treated Smad1DN- and InBaDNexpressing T47D cells. Expression of Smad1DN abrogated MISinduced recruitment of phospho-Smad1 to the Gro-h promoter.
Moreover, compared with MIS-treated control cells, binding of
p65 to the Gro-h promoter was mitigated in Smad1DN-expressing
T47D cells. In InBaDN-expressing cells, neither p65 nor phosphoSmad1 binding to the Gro-h promoter was observed in response
to MIS (Fig. 6B). Together, these results suggest that p65 is likely
to be recruited before phospho-Smad1 to the Gro-h promoter.
The two entities may then functionally interact to form an active
transcription complex.

Figure 5. Nuclear retention of p65 is impaired in Smad1DN-expressing cells.
A, control and Smad1DN-expressing T47D cells were treated with 35 nmol/L
MIS for 30 and 60 min. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed by
Western blot for p65 expression. B, control and Smad1DN-expressing T47D
cells were treated with 35 nmol/L MIS for 2 h. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins
were analyzed by Western blot for p65 expression. The blots were stripped and
reprobed for tubulin and c-myc to determine the purity of protein fractions.

Gro-B inhibits breast cancer cell growth. Consistent with
previous reports (24, 35), Gro-h expression was readily detectable
in immortalized nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells,
MCF10A and 184A1, but almost undetectable in all breast cancer
cell lines (Fig. 6C). Analysis of RNA from human breast carcinoma
and matched normal tissue from 10 patients showed decreased
Gro-h expression in tumors of 7 patients (Fig. 6C). Because MIS
inhibits breast cancer cell growth (2), we tested whether Gro-h may
be responsible for this effect. Equal numbers of T47D cells were
treated with 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/mL of Gro-h for a week, and the
plates were stained with crystal violet; Gro-h suppressed T47D
growth in a dose-dependent manner.

Discussion
Gro-a and Gro-h are expressed in normal mammary epithelium
and suppressed in breast tumors and cancer cell lines (24, 35),
suggesting that they may be potential regulators of growth,
differentiation, and morphogenesis in the mammary gland.
However, little is known about factors that regulate their expression
in mammary epithelial cells or breast cancer cells. Our results show
that, in addition to IL-1, IL-17, and TNF-a (26, 27, 36) that regulate
Gro-a/Gro-h in a variety of cell types, MIS and BMPs, members of
the TGF-h family, also regulate Gro expression in mammary
epithelial cells. Unlike MIS, which predominantly induced Gro-h,
BMP-2 stimulated both Gro-a and Gro-h.
The Gro-h promoter, in addition to containing nB sites, also has
putative binding sites for AP3, SP1, and CRE (26, 37) and a potential
Z-DNA region (37). Although the SP1 and CRE sites in the Gro-h
promoter may contribute to higher basal activity (26), TNF-a and
IL-1 inducibility of Gro-h required NF-nB activation with p50, p65
subunits binding to its nB site (26, 27, 37); the AP3 site was not
sufficient for induction, whether it cooperates with the NF-nB site
is not known (37).
NF-nB–mediated induction of Gro-h by IL-1 was sensitive to
genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphorylation (26). Gro-h
induction by IL-17 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes is mediated by
mitogen-activated protein kinase p38, and inhibitors of tyrosine
kinases and protein kinase C significantly suppressed IL-17–
induced Gro-h expression (36). Although our results suggest that
NF-nB activation by MIS is necessary for Gro-h induction,
characterization of MIS-mediated induction of Gro-h, BTG2, and
IRF-1 revealed that nB sequence within the Gro-h promoter may
subject it to further regulation by phospho-Smad1.
Smad proteins have relatively low DNA binding affinities and
specificities but can regulate transcription either by functional
cooperation with other transcription factors bound to adjacent sites
or through association with DNA-bound transcription factors.
Smad3 and Smad4 interact with jun family to activate activator
protein-1 promoter sequences synergistically (38), and formation of
a complex between signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 and Smad1, bridged by p300, is involved in cooperative
signaling of leukemia inhibitory factor and BMP-2 and subsequent
induction of astrocytes from neural progenitors (39). Although Smad
and NF-nB signaling have been shown to interact with each other,
this is the first report to show that the interaction between activation
of Smad1 and NF-nB is functional. The presence of phospho-Smad1
within the MIS-induced complexes bound to nB site of Gro-h
promoter and recruitment of p65 and phospho-Smad1 to Gro-h
promoter in vivo suggest that NF-nB proteins and phospho-Smad1
may function as coactivators of MIS-induced Gro-h.

Figure 6. Phospho-Smad1 and p65 are
bound to Gro-h promoter. A, T47D cells
were treated with 35 nmol/L MIS for 2 h and
analyzed by ChIP with anti-p65 and
anti–phospho-Smad1 antibodies. Samples
immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP
antibody were used as negative control.
Lysates used for immunoprecipitation were
used as input control. Precipitated DNA
was subjected to PCR analysis using
primers specific for BTG2 promoter region
containing the nB-binding site. Position of
BTG2 promoter fragment. B, control and
Smad1DN- and InBaDN-expressing T47D
cells were treated with MIS for 2 h and

Precipitated DNA was subjected to PCR
analysis using primers specific for Gro-h
promoter region containing the nB-binding
site. Position of Gro-h promoter fragment.
An unrelated site on the Gro-h promoter
was amplified to control for specificity.
The data shown represent an experiment
in which control and InBaDN- and
Smad1DN-expressing T47D cells were
concurrently processed for ChIP and
simultaneously analyzed by PCR. The
PCR products were run on lanes above
and below on the same gel due to a single
row having insufficient number of lanes
for the entire analyses. C, expression of
Gro-h in breast cancer cell lines. Total RNA
from (7.5 Ag) MCF10A, 184A1, BT549,
T47D, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB435, and MDA-MB-468 was analyzed by
Northern blot for expression of Gro-h.
Expression of Gro-h is suppressed in
breast carcinoma. Total RNA isolated
from 10 breast carcinomas and matched
normal tissue was analyzed for Gro-h
mRNA expression. Hybridization to 18S is
shown to control for loading. D, equal
number of T47D cells were cultured in
24-well plates and treated with 100 pg/mL,
1 ng/mL, and 10 ng/mL of Gro-h. Plates
were stained with crystal violet after
7 d. Three representative wells for
each sample.

Although NF-nB is stimulated by a myriad of reagents,
differential regulation of NF-nB–responsive genes, which varies
depending on cell type and stimulus, is not completely understood.
Activation of different NF-nB/Rel subunits, phosphorylation of p65,
and degree of difference in the nB sequence within promoters
(11, 40–43) are likely factors in differential regulation of gene
expression in response to NF-nB activation. Characterization of
binding sites using gel shift assays, promoter transactivation
assays, and ChIP analysis suggests that phospho-Smad1–dependent
Gro-h expression is dictated by sequence of the nB site within the
promoter. It is likely that this sequence plays a role in selective
recruitment of the cofactor Smad1 and NF-nB dimers, leading to
transactivation of Gro-h. Gro-h promoter ChIP of InBaDN- and
Smad1DN-expressing T47D cells suggests that p65 may be
recruited to the Gro-h promoter before phospho-Smad1. Moreover,
the weak NF-nB activation in response to MIS in Smad1DNexpressing cells suggests that phospho-Smad1 may be enhancing
the affinity of NF-nB complexes to this site.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

The fleeting nuclear localization of p65 in Smad1DN-expressing
cells may be sufficient for NF-nB–mediated transactivation of
BTG2 and IRF-1 promoters, which may rely on a different subset of
MIS-inducible cofactors, whereas the lack of Smad1 activation in
these cells may impair the formation of a productive transcription
complex on the nB site of the Gro-h promoter.
It is likely that, in the gel shift assay shown in Fig. 4D and E,
these MIS-inducible, unidentified cofactors lead to efficient
recruitment of the residual NF-nB proteins to the BTG2 and
IRF-1 nB sites.
Leung et al. showed that sequence of the nB site does play an
important role in determining nB family member specificity.
However, the sequence of the site, rather than determining the
ability of a particular dimer to bind effectively, defined the coactivators that would form productive interactions with the DNAbound NF-nB dimer. For example, the nB sites of the IP-10 promoter
recruited IRF-3 to the promoter; lipopolysaccharide, by inducing
IRF-3, functionally activated the p65 homodimers bound to the

MIS-Induced Phospho-Smad1 Activates NF-kB

IP-10 nB site. The coactivator requirement was imposed by a single
nucleotide in the sixth position of the nB site. It is noteworthy
that the sequence of the upstream nB site (GGGAAATTCC) of the
IP-10 gene differs from the nB site of Gro-h (GGGAATTTCC) by
single base at the sixth position and that the COOH-terminal region
of IRF-3 is structurally and topologically similar to the Mad
homology (MH2) domain of Smad proteins (44, 45). Whether the
molecular mechanism by which the cofactors IRF-3 and phosphoSmad1 stimulate NF-nB–mediated transactivation are similar
remains to be investigated.
Experimental evidence indicates that Gro-h may mediate varied
functions. Fibronectin fragments generated from damaged extracellular matrix induce several cytokines, including Gro-h, and augment
inflammatory responses, leading to progressive matrix destruction
and cartilage degradation (25). Gro-h can also regulate angiogenesis.
It inhibits fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced DNA synthesis and
proliferation of bovine capillary endothelial cells and prevents
vascularization in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay and
FGF-induced corneal neovascularization in mice. Consistent with
this observation, Gro-h suppressed the growth of Lewis lung tumors
in immune-competent and immune-deficient mice by suppressing
tumor vascularization, although it was ineffective in regulating the
growth of Lewis lung carcinoma cells in vitro (46). However,
expression of Gro-h (and Gro-a) in immortalized murine melanocytes enhanced colony formation in soft agar and tumorigenicity in
nude mice with an associated induction of angiogenesis (47).
Interestingly, Gro-a–induced transformation of these cells required
Ras activation, whereas Gro-h only weakly induced Ras expression
and activity (48). Thus, biological responses to Gro-h vary depending
on the cellular context. Loss or decline in Gro-h mRNA expression in
breast tumors compared with matched uninvolved tissue suggests
that impaired autocrine/paracrine chemokine signaling may be a
contributing factor in tumorigenesis of the breast.

Although constitutive activation of NF-nB has been reported in
breast cancer cell lines and breast carcinoma (49, 50), the
expression of Gro-b, a NF-nB–responsive gene (26, 27), is low in
breast cancer cell lines and is suppressed in a large percentage of
breast tumors compared with matched uninvolved tissue,
suggesting that additional mechanisms besides NF-nB activation
may be involved in regulating Gro-h expression in breast cancer.
Although NF-nB activation is predominantly associated with
survival signals, there is also evidence to the contrary. RelA null
mouse embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to p53-induced
apoptosis (51). Immortalized embryonic fibroblasts lacking RelA
have a weakly transformed phenotype and form tumors in severe
combined immunodeficient mice, suggesting that RelA under
certain conditions can function as a tumor suppressor (52). MISmediated inhibition of both breast and prostate cancer cell
growth was dependent on activation of NF-nB (2, 28). A likely
explanation for this phenomenon could be selective induction of
NF-nB–regulated growth-inhibitory genes stimulated by MIS and
interaction between two distinct signaling pathways representing
an additional level of specificity in gene regulation, which may
not be achieved with either one alone.
