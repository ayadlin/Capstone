Abstract
Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has been clinically
approved for the treatment of myeloma and lymphoma. Here,
we report a differential effect of bortezomib on apoptosis in
four hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and identify
the major molecular event that determines sensitivity.
Although bortezomib inhibited proteasome activity to a
similar extent in all HCC cell lines, it showed differential
effects on their viability: Huh-7 (IC50 196 nmol/L), Sk-Hep1
(IC50 180 nmol/L), Hep3B (IC50 112 nmol/L), and resistant
PLC5 (IC50 >1,000 nmol/L). Bortezomib caused cell cycle arrest
at G2-M phase in all HCC cells tested whereas apoptotic
induction was found only in sensitive cells but not in PLC5
cells. No significant bortezomib-induced NF-KB changes were
noted in Huh-7 and PLC5. Bortezomib down-regulated
phospho-Akt (P-Akt) in a dose- and time-dependent manner
in all sensitive HCC cells whereas no alterations of P-Akt were
found in PLC5. Down-regulation of Akt1 by small interference
RNA overcame the apoptotic resistance to bortezomib in PLC5
cells, but a constitutively activated Akt1 protected Huh-7 cells
from bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, bortezomib showed suppression of tumor growth with downregulation of P-Akt in Huh-7 tumors but not in PLC5 tumors.
Down-regulation of P-Akt represents a major molecular event
of bortezomib-induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines and may be
a biomarker for predicting clinical response to HCC treatment. Targeting Akt signaling overcomes drug resistance
to bortezomib in HCC cells, which provides a new approach
for the combinational therapy of HCC. [Cancer Res 2008;

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently the fifth most
common solid tumor worldwide and the fourth leading cause of
cancer-related death. Risk factors for HCC include cirrhosis due to
chronic hepatitis B virus (1) or chronic hepatitis C virus (1)
infection or coinfection, alfatoxin exposure, alcoholic cirrhosis,
male gender, cigarette smoking, and advanced age (2). Among
these risk factors, chronic HBV and HCV infections are the two

most important for HCC development in the Far East including
Taiwan (1). Notably, the importance of HBV in hepatocarcinogenesis has been confirmed by evidence indicating that
vaccination for HBV decreases the incidence of HCC in children
in Taiwan (3).
Surgery is currently the only curative treatment but it is only
feasible in a minority of patients (f20–30%; ref. 4). For those
patients who have advanced stage disease, poor liver function, or
recurrent tumors after local treatments, systemic pharmacologic
treatment is the final and main therapy. Unfortunately, the
response rate to traditional chemotherapy for HCC patients is
quite low and the outcome is also poor (4). Hence, new drugs
with a higher therapeutic index are urgently needed for these
patients. In this regard, molecular targeted agents offer hope for
improving outcomes in the future as witnessed by recent approval
of sorafenib (5).
A novel molecular agent, bortezomib ( formally PS-341, or
Velcade; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), is a dipeptidyl boronic
acid that reversibly inhibits the 20S proteasome. It has been
approved clinically for the treatment of refractory multiple
myeloma and mantel cell lymphoma worldwide (6, 7). Although a
number of clinical trials of bortezomib in solid tumors have been
conducted, the lack of significant clinical benefit in preliminary
results of those trials (8–10) may suggest that the molecular targets
of bortezomib in solid tumor are different from those reported in
hematologic malignancies.
Among the known targets of bortezomib in myeloma and
lymphoma, nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) has been proposed as a
major target of bortezomib as a proteasome inhibitor (7). NF-nB
plays a key role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasiveness,
metastasis, tumorigenesis, and angiogenesis (11). Proteasome
inhibitors such as bortezomib sequester NF-nB in the cytoplasm
and reduce its transcriptional activity through blocking of the
degradation of its inhibitor InB (7). Numerous studies indicated
that bortezomib inhibits antitumor activity against cancer cells
through the mechanism of stabilizing InB and consequently
decreasing the activity of NF-nB (12, 13).
In addition, tumor suppressor p53 is also a substrate of the
proteasome, and previous study has shown that expression of a
dominant-negative p53 in Rat-1 fibroblasts decreased apoptosis
induced by proteasome inhibitors (14). Moreover, Bcl-2 family
protein is also the target of proteasome inhibitor. Bcl-2 family
members play a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis and are
substrates of the proteasome (15). Bortezomib has been shown to
induce phosphorylation and cleavage of Bcl-2 in association with
G2-M phase cell cycle arrest (16). Other studies have also indicated
that the accumulation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bid,

Bik, and Bim is associated with proteasome inhibitor–induced
apoptosis (17). Moreover, evidence indicated that Bik and/or Bim
may participate in the apoptotic effect of bortezomib.
In this study, we investigated the differential effects of
bortezomib among various HCC cell lines and the extent of the
inhibition of Akt signaling as a major molecular mechanism in
determining bortezomib-induced apoptosis in HCC cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Bortezomib (Velcade) was provided by Millennium Pharmaceuticals. LY294002 and rapamycin were purchased from Cayman Chemical
and Calbiochem, respectively.
Cell culture. The Huh7 HCC cell line was obtained from the Health
Science Research Resources Bank (JCRB0403). The Sk-Hep-1, Hep3Bl, and
PLC5 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin sulfate, and
25 Ag/mL amphotericin B in a 37jC humidified incubator under an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.
Cell viability analysis. The effect of bortezomib on hepatoma cell
viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in 12 replicates. The procedure has previously
been described (18).
Western blot analysis. Lysates of Huh-7, Sk-hep1, Hep3B, and PLC5 cells
treated with bortezomib at the indicated concentrations for 24 h were
prepared for immunoblotting of caspase-9, caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), phospho-Akt (P-Akt), Akt, PTEN, phosphoinositidedependent kinase 1 (PDK1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), mTOR, Rictor,
SIN1/MIP1, etc. Western blot analysis was done as previously reported
(19). Antibodies for immunoblotting were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology or Cell Signaling (18).
Flow cytometry for cell cycle analysis. HCC cells were treated with
DMSO or bortezomib at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. The
procedure has previously been described and cell cycle phase distributions
were determined on a FACScan flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter; ref. 19).
Apoptosis analysis. The following three methods were used to assess
drug-induced apoptotic cell death: detection of DNA fragmentation with the
Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics), Western blot analysis
of caspase activation and PARP cleavage, and measurement of apoptotic
cells by flow cytometry (sub-G1). The ELISA was done according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (19).
Proteasome activity assay. A 20S Proteasome Activity Assay kit
(Chemicon) was used to determine the inhibition of proteasome in drugtreated HCC cells. All the procedures were done according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (20).
NF-KB binding activity. The Trans-AM NF-nB p65 Transcription Factor
Assay kit (Active Motif North America) was used to determine the activity of
NF-nB binding in bortezomib-treated HCC cells. The entire procedure was
done in accordance with the manufacturer’s manual. Briefly, HCC cells were
exposed to bortezomib at the indicated doses for 4, 8, and 24 h and cell
lysates were prepared. NF-nB binding to related DNA fragments was
determined by incubation with primary antibody, anti-p65, and quantified
at 450 nm after incubation with anti-IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate
as previously described (21).
Target validation. Two approaches were used for in vitro validation.
First, the Akt1 small interference RNA (siRNA) duplex targeting the
sequence 5¶-UAAUGUGCCCGUCCUUGUCUU-3¶ of human Akt1 gene and
control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. Briefly, PLC5 cells
were transfected with siRNA (the final concentration is 100 nmol/L) in
six-well plates using the Dharma-FECT4 transfection reagent (Dharmacon)
according to the instructions in the manufacturer’s manual. After 48 h, the
medium was replaced and PLC5 cells were incubated for an additional
24 h with bortezomib for Western blot analysis and apoptosis analysis by
flow cytometry as previously described. Second, Huh-7 cells were trans-

fected with the constitutive active Akt1 construct HA-PKB-T308D/S473D as
previously described (19). Briefly, following transfections, cells were
incubated in the presence of G418 at 0.78 mg/mL. After 8 wk of selection,
surviving colonies (i.e., those arising from stably transfected cells) were
selected and individually amplified. Huh-7 cells with stable expression of
constitutive Akt (Huh7-akt) were then treated with various doses of
bortezomib for Western blot analysis as previously described (19).
Xenograft tumor growth. Male NCr athymic nude mice (5–7 wk of age)
were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei,
Taiwan). The mice were group-housed under conditions of a constant
12-h photoperiod with ad libitum access to sterilized food and water. All
experimental procedures using these mice were done in accordance with
protocols approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use
Committee of National Taiwan University. Each mouse was inoculated s.c.
in the dorsal flank with 1  106 HCC cells suspended in 0.1 mL of serumfree medium containing 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences). When tumors
reached 200 to 300 mm3, mice received an i.p. injection of bortezomib at
1 mg/kg body weight twice weekly for the duration of the study. Controls
received vehicle. Tumors were measured weekly using calipers and
their volumes calculated using the following standard formula: width2 
length  0.52. Body weight was measured weekly (19).
Western blot analysis of P-Akt status in HCC xenograft tumors.
At sacrifice, tumors were harvested from mice, and a portion of each tumor
was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80jC until analysis.
Tumor tissue homogenates were prepared in SDS lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture] as previously
described (19). Western blot analysis was done.
Statistical analysis. Tumor growth data points are reported as mean
tumor volume F SE. Comparisons of mean values were done using the
independent samples t test in SPSS for Windows 11.5 software (SPSS,
Inc.; ref. 19).

Results
Differential effects of bortezomib on viability and apoptotic
death in HCC cells. To investigate the antitumor effect of
bortezomib on HCC cells, we first assessed the growth inhibitory
effect of bortezomib in a panel of four human HCC cell lines,
including Huh7, Sk-Hep1, Hep3B, and PLC5, at clinically relevant
concentrations (according to data from Millennium, median
concentration of C max is 1,300 nmol/L). Cell viability was determined by MTT assay after 72 hours of treatment. As shown in
Fig. 1A, bortezomib exhibited differential effects on viability
of the four types of cells. Bortezomib caused a dose-dependent
reduction in cell viability in Huh-7 (IC50 196 nmol/L), Sk-Hep1
(IC 50 180 nmol/L), Hep3B (IC 50 112 nmol/L), and PLC5
(IC50 >1,000 nmol/L). PLC5 showed resistance to bortezomib on
cell viability, which was significant at doses >100 nmol/L (P < 0.01,
compared with all of the other three types of cells).
Evidence indicates that the growth inhibition was caused by cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. The activation of caspases
and the cleavage of PARP were determined by Western blotting
after 24 hours of treatment. Data illustrated in Fig. 1B indicate that
bortezomib caused the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and
subsequently the cleavage of PARP in all sensitive cell lines in a
dose-dependent manner, starting at a concentration of 50 to
100 nmol/L. However, no apoptotic evidence could be found in
PLC5 cells at all tested concentrations. In addition, resistance
to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in PLC5 was also confirmed by
a DNA fragmentation ELISA assay. Bortezomib induced a dosedependent induction of DNA fragmentation in Huh7 cells, starting
at the concentration of 100 nmol/L after treatment for 24 hours,
whereas the apoptotic induction was not found in bortezomibtreated PL5 cells (Fig. 1C).

Differential effect of bortezomib on apoptosis in HCC
cells may be unassociated with proteasome inhibition. To
characterize the mechanism responsible for the differential
apoptotic effects of bortezomib in HCC cells, we initially examined
whether the differential effect of bortezomib on apoptosis is
associated with the effects of bortezomib on the inhibition of
proteasome.
Several lines of evidence suggest that the apoptotic effect of
bortezomib may not be associated with proteasome inhibition.
First, we examined the proteasome inhibitory effect of bortezomib
in the four HCC cell lines. HCC cells were treated with different
doses of bortezomib for 2 hours, according to methods used in
a previous clinical study (8). Bortezomib showed a similar pattern
and degree of proteasome inhibition on both sensitive and
resistant cell lines without any significant differences, suggesting
that the effect of bortezomib on proteasome inhibition is not

associated with its differential cellular effect on HCC cells
(Fig. 2A).
According to a previous report (20), bortezomib causes cancer
cell cycle arrest at G2-M phase, which is associated with
proteasome inhibition. As shown in Fig. 2B, bortezomib induced
cell cycle arrest at G2-M phase in a dose-dependent manner after
treatment for 24 hours both in sensitive and resistant cells, which
indicates that bortezomib is able to cause cell cycle arrest in PLC5
cells although it is unable to induce apoptosis. Given the fact that
reports have linked the effects of bortezomib on cell cycle with
proteasome inhibition (20–23), this result provides additional
evidence to support the hypothesis that proteasome inhibition
may not be associated with the differential effect of bortezomib on
HCC cells.
Another molecular sequel of proteasome inhibition is the
inhibition of NF-nB signaling. Previous studies have shown that

differential effect of bortezomib on
apoptosis in HCC cells is not associated
with proteasome inhibition. A, a similar
dose-dependent effect of bortezomib
on proteasome inhibition was found in
four HCC cell lines. HCC cells were

doses for 2 h before measurement of

indicated doses for 8, 16, and 24 h. Nuclear
extracts were prepared and assayed for
p65 protein levels by Western blot. D, top,
NF-nB/nuclear p65 binding activity was
not changed after bortezomib treatment
in both types of cells. Cells were treated

prepared and assayed for p65 binding
activity by ELISA kit. Columns, mean
(n = 3); bars, SD. Bottom, bortezomib
abolished NF-nB activation induced by
TNF-a in PLC5 cells. Cells were exposed

for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared
and assayed for p65 binding activity by
ELISA kit. Columns, mean (n = 3);
bars, SD. *, P < 0.05. Cytoplasmic extracts
were prepared and assay for InB-a by

bortezomib inhibits NF-nB signaling by preventing degradation of
InB-a, whereas nuclear translocation and accumulation of NF-nB
subunit p65 is critical in activating NF-nB signaling. Here, we
analyzed protein levels of nuclear p65 and NF-nB binding activity
in both sensitive Huh-7 and resistant PLC5 cells treated with
bortezomib. As shown in Fig. 2C, nuclear expression levels of p65
protein were quite low in both sensitive Huh-7 and resistant PLC5

cells. The time-dependent analysis indicates that bortezomib did
not cause significant alterations in the expressions levels of nuclear
p65 in both sensitive and resistant cells. In addition, bortezomib
did not show a significant inhibitory effect on NF-nB binding
activity in both cell lines at three time points within 24 hours
(Fig. 2D, top). Notably, bortezomib reversed the degradation
of InB-a induced by tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) and

subsequently inhibited NF-nB activation in PLC5 cells (Fig. 2D,
bottom). Together, these results indicate that the NF-nB pathway
may not play a key role in mediating the differential effect of
bortezomib on apoptosis in the tested HCC cells.
Down-regulation of Akt signaling determines apoptosis
induction. Our results indicate that bortezomib may mediate
apoptosis in HCC cells through a nonproteasome mechanism.
In addition, bortezomib induced a caspase-dependent apoptosis
in association with the activation of caspase-9, suggesting that
the intrinsic mitochondria pathway plays an important role in
mediating the effect of bortezomib on apoptosis (Fig. 1B).
Accordingly, we identified that down-regulation of P-Akt at Ser473
was the major molecular determinant of bortezomib-induced
apoptosis in HCC cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, bortezomib induced
down-regulation of P-Akt at Ser473 in all sensitive HCC cells in a
dose-dependent manner, but not in resistant PLC5 cells.
Furthermore, down-regulation of P-Akt was associated with
apoptosis induction characterized by the activation of caspase-9
and PARP cleavage in sensitive Huh-7 cells in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 3B). In light of the effects of bortezomib on protein
turnover, we analyzed the expression levels of upstream PI3K
signaling proteins, which might affect P-Akt level in Huh7 cells. As
shown in Fig. 3C, levels of PI3K pathway proteins, including p85
(regulatory subunit of PI3K), PTEN, PDK1, and P-Akt at Thr308,
were not altered significantly after treatment with bortezomib for
24 hours in sensitive Huh7 cells, although a moderate decrease of
p110 in cells at high doses of bortezomib was noted. Recent
studies indicated that a mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2 or RictormTOR) is responsible for the activation of P-Akt at Ser473 (24, 25).
Our data showed that the protein levels of mTORC2, including
phospho-mTOR, mTOR, Rictor, and SIN1/MIP1, were not altered
significantly in both Huh-7 and PLC5 cells after exposure to
bortezomib for 24 hours (Fig. 3D).
In addition, we analyzed other signaling proteins that may
regulate mitochodria-related apoptotic pathway in both sensitive
Huh-7 and resistant PLC5 cells. Protein levels of proapoptotic
proteins such as Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bik were not significantly
changed in both Huh-7 and PLC5 cells. Cleaved Bim was slightly
increased after treatment with bortezomib in Huh-7 cells but not in
PLC5 cells, providing additional evidence of the differential
apoptotic effects of bortezomib in HCC cells. For antiapoptotic
proteins, we compared protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis between Huh-7 and PLC5 cells
and found no major alterations in bortezomib-treated HCC cells
(data not shown).
Target validation. Three approaches were carried out to
validate the inhibition of Akt signaling as a major molecular target
responsible for the in vitro apoptotic effect of bortezomib in HCC
cells. First, we knocked down protein expression of Akt1 in
resistant PLC5 by using siRNA. Down-regulation of Akt1 sensitized
PLC5 cells to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent
manner, and this effect was associated with the activation of
caspase-3, PARP cleavage, and increased number of apoptotic cells
(Fig. 4A).
Next, Huh7-Akt, which stably expressed constitutive active Akt1,
was generated to examine the apoptotic effect of bortezomib.
As shown in Fig. 4B, Huh7-Akt showed relative resistance to
bortezomib-induced apoptosis with statistical significance at
concentrations >100 nmol/L (P < 0.05).
Additionally, we examined whether inhibition of PI3K, which
is upstream of Akt, may alter the proapoptotic effect of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

bortezomib in HCC cells. Our data showed that combination
of LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, with bortezomib overcame the
resistance of bortezomib in PLC5 cells in association with downregulation of P-Akt (Ser473), indicating that inhibition of the PI3K
pathway is a critical step to the proapoptotic effect of bortezomib in resistant HCC cells (Fig. 4C). We found that inhibition
of PI3K alone was not sufficient to induce apoptosis in PLC5
cells, suggesting that bortezomib may have effects other than
regulation of P-Akt in resistant cells.
Finally, we found that rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, downregulated phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Fig. 4D) but was unable
to enhance apoptosis in bortezomib-treated PLC5 cells. However,
given the fact that mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive (25), the
possibility that mTORC2 may still play a role in this scenario
cannot be excluded, although protein levels of the complex were
not affected (Fig. 3D).
In vivo effect of bortezomib in HCC xenograft tumor. To
confirm whether the differential antitumor effect of bortezomib in
HCC cell lines has potentially relevant clinical implications, we
assessed the in vivo effect of bortezomib on the growth of HCC
xenograft tumors. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with vehicle or
bortezomib i.p. at the clinically relevant dose of 1.0 mg/kg twice a
week for the duration of the study. All animals tolerated the
treatments well without observable signs of toxicity and were
characterized by stable body weights throughout the course of
study. No gross pathologic abnormalities were noted at necropsy.
As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment with bortezomib had a significant
inhibitory effect on Huh-7 tumor after 2 weeks of treatment
(P < 0.05) and tumor size in the treatment group was only 50%
that of control at the end of study. To correlate biological response
with the mechanism of action identified in vitro, the effect of
bortezomib on P-Akt in Huh tumor was examined by Western
immunoblotting. Figure 5A shows Western blots of Akt and P-Akt
in the homogenates of three representative Huh-7 tumors. Overall,
a significant decrease in P-Akt was noted in Huh7 tumors treated
with bortezomib.
In contrast, treatment with bortezomib did not show a
significant inhibitory effect in PLC5 tumor. Mice bearing PLC5
tumor were treated with the same dose and schedule as mice with
Huh-7 tumor. As shown in Fig. 5B, bortezomib treatment was
unable to significantly reduce the size of PLC5 tumor. In line with
the data on tumor growth, bortezomib showed a marginal effect on
P-Akt in PLC5 tumor.

Discussion
Although bortezomib has clinically proven activity in hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma and mantle cell
lymphoma, development toward clinical use of bortezomib in solid
tumor has been slow and the results have not been promising
(8–10, 26). The findings suggest that the antitumor mechanism of
bortezomib may be different from that in blood malignances. This
study provides new information about the apoptotic effects of
bortezomib in HCC cells. In all four HCC cell lines studied,
bortezomib at clinically relevant doses induced apoptosis in a
concentration-dependent manner in most of the HCC cell lines
tested but not in resistant PLC5 cells. Bortezomib-induced apoptosis is associated with the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3,
and PARP cleavage, suggesting that a mitochondria signaling
pathway is important here, which is consistent with previous
reports (27, 28). Our findings are also consistent with differential

responses to bortezomib, which have been shown recently in many
types of cancer such as lung (29), prostate (30), breast (20), and
B-cell lymphoma (21, 31).
In this study, we show that whereas bortezomib inhibits
proteasome activity in both Huh7 and PLC5 cells, their sensitivities
to bortezomib are strikingly different. These results might indicate
that the differential effect of bortezomibs on apoptosis in HCC cells
is not associated with proteasome inhibition activity, consistent
with a previous study on breast cancer (20). However, the
possibility that other uncertain defects of proteasome downstream
exist in PLC5 cells could not be ruled out. Although a large body of
the underlying mechanism accounting for the resistance of PLC5
cells to bortezomib remains to be uncovered, further studies are
important for the application of bortezomib.

Numerous studies have indicated that bortezomib-induced cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis through inhibition of the NF-nB
signaling pathway is a sequel of proteasome inhibition (7, 12, 32).
However, in the present study, bortezomib did not show
significant activity on the NF-nB signaling pathway, including
the DNA binding activity and nuclear translocation of p65 in both
sensitive Huh-7 and PLC5 cells. This result supports that the
apoptotic effect of bortezomib on HCC cells is independent of the
inhibition of NF-nB activation. Other studies have also shown
similar NF-nB–independent phenomena in various types of
tumors (20, 21, 28, 33).
Besides NF-nB, tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to be a
target of bortezomib, and bortezomib was more sensitive in lung
cells with functional p53 (29). The four HCC cell lines used in this

study vary with respect to their p53 functional status. Huh7 cells
express a codon 220–mutant p53, and PLC5 cells express a codon
139/161– and codon 249–mutated p53, whereas Hep3B is a p53null cell line. Sk-hep1 has homozygous deletion of p14ARF in the p53
pathway (34). Whereas all four HCC lines bear different types of
p53 mutation, unexpectedly, bortezomib still induced differential
apoptotic activities among them. It might be important to ask
whether different types of p53 mutation are associated with the
sensitivity of HCC cells to bortezomib, particularly, about the fact
that p53 protein is frequently mutated in HCC. Recently reports
show that mutant p53 might not only lose its normal biological

functions but acquire some uncertain oncogenic functions, a
process of ‘‘gain of function,’’ which might be involved in tumor
progression and drug resistance of tumor cells (35). Therefore, it is
very possible that different kinds of p53 mutation in HCC cells
might be an important factor in cellular response to bortezomib.
Further studies on the manipulation of p53 gene, with wild-type or
different types of mutation, in HCC cells are expected to provide a
clearer picture of the relationship between p53 status and the
sensitivity of tumor cells toward bortezomib.
Examination of mitochondria-related apoptotic proteins revealed no significant alterations between sensitive Huh-7 and

resistant PLC5 cells, whereas Bax degradation and Bik accumulation have previously been shown in bortezomib-treated cancer
cells (36). A mild decrease of Bcl-2 protein level in Huh-7 was
observed in cells treated with high doses of bortezomib in this
study. However, this reduction was not dose dependent and a
similar effect was not observed in Hep3B and Sk-Hep1 (data not
shown), indicating that this effect on Bcl-2 is not a major event
for all HCC cells. In addition, a recent study showed that Mcl-1 is
a key target for bortezomib-induced apoptosis in myeloma cells
(37). However, our results show that bortezomib increased Mcl-1
levels in both sensitive and resistant cells, suggesting that alterations of Mcl-1 should not be a major event involved in apoptosis
induction.
In the present study, down-regulation of P-Akt was shown to
occur in a time- and dose-dependent manner after bortezomib
treatment of all sensitive HCC cells. Several studies have reported
that bortezomib applied solely in breast cancer cells (20, 38),
having synergy with sorafenib in various types of cancer cells (39),
or acting as a radiosensitizer in head and neck cancer cells can also
alter Akt activity (40). Importantly, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
plays a major role in carcinogenesis and drug resistance in numerous types of cancer including HCC (41). Several studies have also
shown that tumors with the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling
become more aggressive and are associated with poor prognosis in
patients with HCC (42, 43). Notably, the activation of PI3K signaling
including PTEN mutation has been observed in 40% to 50% of HCC
tumors (2, 43), indicating the importance of Akt signaling in HCC.

www.aacrjournals.org

With respect to the mechanism by which bortezomib affects the
level of P-Akt, our results showed that bortezomib reduced P-Akt,
but not total Akt, in drug-treated cells, which suggests at least
two putative mechanisms. First, bortezomib may down-regulate
P-Akt by decreasing upstream kinase signaling, such as PDK1 and
PI3K, or increasing the activity of phosphatase, PTEN. In this
regard, our results show that protein levels of these upstream
proteins do not change significantly after bortezomib treatment
although kinase activities were not examined in this study.
Second, bortezomib may increase the activity of protein phosphatases, which can reduce the phosphorylation status of P-Akt.
Recent studies have shown that PHLPP is a specific protein
phosphatase for P-Akt at Ser473 (44, 45). We found that bortezomib did not alter the expression levels of PHLPP in either
Huh-7 or PLC5 cells (data not shown), suggesting that PHLPP is
not a target for down-regulating P-Akt in bortezomib-treated HCC
cells. Furthermore, inhibitors of other nonspecific phosphatases,
such as protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A, seem
to be able to restore down-regulation of P-Akt in bortezomibtreated Huh-7 cells (our preliminary data), indicating that bortezomib might reduce P-Akt in association with the activation of
protein phosphatases. This result may be supported by a recent
study that indicated that the proteasome inhibitor MG-132
down-regulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase and Akt phosphorylation by inducing intracellular protein phosphatase 2A
translocation (46). Further study of related mechanisms of bortezomib on protein phosphatases is needed. The underlying

mechanism of the constitutive activation of Akt in bortezomibtreated PLC5 cells remains unknown. One possible explanation is
that the protein phosphatases for Akt dephosphorylation are
defective in PLC5 cells, although it remains to be identified. On
the other hand, a distinct compensatory survival pathway that
activates Akt might be induced by bortezomib in PLC5 cells. This
hypothesis is supported by several recent studies on mTOR
inhibitors. For example, RAD001, a mTOR inhibitor, induces Akt
phosphorylation at Ser473 by activating the insulin-like growth
factor I receptor signaling pathway (47, 48).
Combinational therapy for molecular targeted therapy has been
a common approach to improve responsiveness in cancer therapy
(5, 49, 50). This study revealed that targeting the Akt signaling
pathway overcomes drug resistance to bortezomib in PLC5 cells.
This may provide a promising strategy for designing clinical
trials of bortezomib in patients with HCC. In addition, evidence
indicates that the major hindrance of molecular targeted therapy in
solid tumors, especially HCC, is very low response rate and high
costs (5, 50). However, patients are more tolerant to targeted
therapies compared with traditional chemotherapeutic agents

(5, 49). Hence, the ability to select patients with a high response
rate by detecting drug-related biomarkers is important to improve
clinical efficacy. In this regard, this study has shown that P-Akt
status is a good biomarker for predicting the response of HCC
tumors to bortezomib, which may be useful in future clinical
investigations.
