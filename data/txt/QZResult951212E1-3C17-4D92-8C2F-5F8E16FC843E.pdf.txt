ABSTRACT
The oncogenic STAT3 signaling pathway is emerging as a promising target for
the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). In the present study, we identified a novel
STAT3 inhibitor SC99 in a target-based high throughput screen. SC99 inhibited JAK2STAT3 activation but had no effects on other transcription factors such as NF-κB,
and kinases such as AKT, ERK, and c-Src that are in association with STAT3 signaling
pathway. Furthermore, SC99 downregulated the expression of STAT3-modulated
genes, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, VEGF, cyclin D2, and E2F-1. By inhibiting the STAT3
signaling, SC99 induced MM cell apoptosis which could be partly abolished by the
ectopic expression of STAT3. Furthermore, SC99 displayed potent anti-MM activity
in two independent MM xenograft models in nude mice. Oral administration of SC99
led to marked decrease of tumor growth within 10 days at a daily dosage of 30 mg/
kg, but did not raise toxic effects. Taken together, this study identified a novel oral
JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor that could be developed as an anti-myeloma agent.

[7, 8]. In addition, STAT3 also regulates angiogenesis
via the transcription of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) [9].
STAT3 is overexpressed in a broad range of cancers
including hematological malignancies, including leukemia
[10], lymphoma [11] and multiple myeloma (MM)
[12, 13]. MM is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells.
In a survey of constitutive and activated STAT3 expression
and MM therapy, STAT3 was found highly expressed in
more than 63% of CD138+ bone marrow cells of primary
MM patients [14] and the highly activated STAT3 is
associated with chemoresistance to most of the standard
therapies [13], including dexamethasone [14]. Currently,
The STAT3 signaling pathway has been proposed as a

INTRODUCTION
Signal transducer and activator of transcription
3 (STAT3) is an oncogenic transcription factor widely
expressed in many tissues and plays an important role in
regulating cellular activities. Being activated by a panel
of stimuli, including cytokines, such as interleukin-6
(IL-6) [1, 2], and growth factors, such as insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1) [1, 2], STAT3 forms homo- or
hetero-dimers before being translocated to the nuclei
where it binds to DNA and regulates gene transcription
[1, 3]. STAT3 has a broad spectrum of substrate genes
including anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, Bcl-2, survivin [4–6],
and cell cycle regulators (such as D-cyclins, E2F-1)

promising target for MM therapy [15]. A recent clinical
trial with a STAT3 inhibitor OPB-51602 has been reported
for the treatment of MM and acute myeloid leukemia [16].
D-type cyclins including cyclin D1, D2 and D3 are
key members in regulating cell cycle progress. Cyclin
D2 (CCND2) was reported in more than 50% of MM
cell lines and primary patient cells [17] and is associated
with poor prognosis [18]. We previously demonstrated
that knock-down CCND2 can induce MM cell apoptosis
[19]. Because CCND2 could be regulated by STAT3 [20]
and this duo is critical for MM pathogenesis and poor
clinical outcomes, targeting STAT3/CCND2 is an antiMM strategy. In the present study, we designed a screen
of STAT3/CCND2 inhibitors, through which a novel small
molecule compound called SC99 was found to inhibit
STAT3 via JAK2, a kinase that activates STAT3, and
displayed oral potency in the treatment of MM.

analyses against p-STAT3. As shown in Figure 2A,
SC99 decreased the p-STAT3 level but had no effects
on total STAT3 expression in all cell lines examined.
Moreover, SC99 was found to suppress STAT3 activation
in a concentration- and time course-dependent manner
(Figure 2B and 2C). STAT3 phosphorylation was
decreased at a concentration as low as 2.5 μM of SC99,
and it was completely inhibited by SC99 at 10 μM
(Figure 2B). In the time-course study, constitutive STAT3
phosphorylation was suppressed by SC99 within 30 min
in OPM2 cells (Figure 2C). Therefore, SC99 was potent
to inhibit STAT3 activation.
STAT3 activation leads to STAT3 dimerization and
further is translocated to the nuclei where it exerts its
transcriptional activity [22]. To evaluate whether SC99
interferes with STAT3 dimerization, we designed a Mycand a Flag-tagged STAT3 plasmid. These two plasmids
were then co-transfected into HEK293T cells followed
by SC99 treatment. The whole cell lysates were then
subjected to immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting assay.
As shown in Figure 2D, dimerization of Myc-STAT3:FlagSTAT3 was found in the absence of SC99, but this
dimerization was significantly decreased when SC99 was
added. Because STAT3 dimerization is an outcome of
STAT3 activation, this experiment further demonstrated
that SC99 inhibited STAT3 activation.
There are 7 members in the STAT3 family, of
which STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 are associated with
oncogenesis, to exclude the effects of SC99 on STAT1
and STAT5, MM cells were treated with SC99 for 24
hrs followed by immunoblotting analysis. It turned
out that SC99 dose-dependently suppressed STAT3
phosphorylation, but had no effects on the p-STAT1 or
p-STAT5 level (Figure 2E). Therefore, SC99 preferred to
inhibit STAT3 activation.

RESULTS
Identification of SC99 as a STAT3 inhibitor
To find out small molecule compounds that
inhibit STAT3 activation and CCND2 transactivation,
a luciferase reporter system driven by the CCND2
promoter containing a STAT3 response element was
stably established in NIH3T3 cells and was applied
to screen a Maybridge chemical library composed of
56000 compounds with unknown functions as described
previously [21], from which SC99 was identified. SC99
inhibited STAT3-luciferase (Figure 1A) but did not
inhibit luciferase activity modulated by another nuclear
transcription factor NF-κB (Figure 1B). Consistent with
this finding, SC99 inhibited the transactivation of CCND2
promoter which containing a STAT3 response element
(Figure 1C) but failed to suppress the transactivation
of CCND2 promoter which lacks a STAT3 response
element (Figure 1D). These results thus suggested that
SC99 was probably a STAT3 inhibitor. To optimize
the structure of SC99, a panel of SC99 analogs were
designed and synthesized (Figure 1E) and were applied
to test their inhibitory effects on STAT3 activation at the
phosphorylation level at Tyr705 (p-STAT3). As shown
in Figure 1F, SC99 was the most potent one to inhibit
STAT3 phosphorylation in both cell lines examined. JP31
also inhibited STAT3 activation but less potent than SC99
which was probably due to the 3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl
group, especially the chlorine and fluorine atoms that
were missing from JP31.

SC99 inhibits STAT3 nuclear translocation
STAT3 is a transcription factor and it must enter
nuclei to exert its activity after its activation. The above
experiments showed that SC99 potently inhibited STAT3
activation, to further evaluate whether SC99 affected
STAT3 nuclear translocation, an immunofluorescent assay
was performed. Starved OPM2 cells were pre-treated
with DMSO or SC99 followed by IL-6 stimulation for
20 min because IL-6 can trigger STAT3 phosphorylation
and nuclear import [23]. The immunofluorescent assay
revealed that in the resting status without IL-6 stimulation,
both STAT3 and p-STAT3 were distributed around the
nuclei or in the cytosol, however, when IL-6 was added,
both total and activated STAT3 were mainly found in the
nuclei (Figure 3A and 3B). As expected, pretreatment
of SC99 prevented STAT3 from activation and nuclear
translocation, which was similar to a previous report [23].
These findings further demonstrated that SC99 inhibited
STAT3 activation.

SC99 inhibits STAT3 activation and dimerization
To investigate the effect of SC99 on the
constitutive activation of STAT3, five MM cell lines
with highly activated STAT3 were treated with SC99
(10 μM) or DMSO, followed by immunoblotting

SC99 inhibits JAK2 but not other kinases
associated with STAT3 signaling

JAK2 is a key kinase activating STAT3, we
therefore evaluated the effect of SC99 on JAK2. As shown
in Figure 4B, SC99 inhibited JAK2 phosphorylation in a
concentration-dependent manner. At 2.5 μM, SC99 was
capable to inactivate JAK2 in a manner similar to the
inhibition on STAT3 (Figure 2B). As reported previously,
STAT3 can be activated by the cytockine IL-6 via JAK2
signaling [1, 2]. To find out whether SC99 was able to
repress IL-6-stimulated JAK2 and STAT3 activation,
starved OPM2 cells were pre-treated with SC99 followed
by IL-6 stimulation. As expected, addition of IL-6 raised
the phosphorylation level of both JAK2 and STAT3 which
could be suppressed by SC99 within 30 min (Figure 4C).

Several important signaling pathways are in associa­
tion with STAT3 activation, including MAPK/ERK [24],
PI3K/AKT/mTOR [25], c-Src [26], and JAK pathways
[24]. We next evaluated the effects of SC99 on these specific
kinases including JAK2, ERK, AKT, mTOR, and c-Src by
immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 4A, although SC99
steadily suppressed STAT3 activation, it did not inhibit
the phosphorylation levels of AKT, ERK, mTOR or c-Src
at a concentration up to 20 μM, which suggested that the
inhibition of SC99 on STAT3 was not an off-target effect.

as cyclins and transcription factor E2F-1 [7, 9]. Because
STAT3 inhibitors usually result in decreased expression
of STAT3 targeted genes [27], and the above studies had
demonstrated that SC99 was a JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor. We
subsequently evaluated the effect of SC99 inhibition on
STAT3 downstream gene expression by immunoblotting.
As shown in Figure 5A, SC99 suppressed the expression
of cyclin D2 and E2F-1 in a concentration-dependent
manner which was similar to the effects of SC99 on
the promoter transactivation of cyclin D2 as shown in
Figure 1A. Because these proteins are key regulators of
cell cycle progression, SC99 arrested MM cells at the G1
phase (Supplementary Figure S1).
STAT3 is also involved in cell survival by
upregulating several important genes, such as Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xl [4, 5]. To further view the effects of SC99 on the
activity of STAT3, we next measured the protein levels
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. As shown in Figure 5B, both Bcl-2

To further evaluate whether SC99 could interfere with
the JAK2 molecule, a computer modeling was performed.
The results showed that SC99 was well docked into the
ATP-binding pocket of JAK2 in which SC99 formed strong
and stable hydrogen bond (red line in Figure 4D) with
Leu932 of JAK2. The H-bond could prevent SC99 from
escaping from the active sites and enhanced the inhibition of
JAK2. Moreover, because of the hydrophobicity of the ATPpocket, SC99 formed extensive van der Waals interactions
with the hydrophobic residues of JAK2 (Figure 4D). These
results further indicated that SC99 strongly interacted with
JAK2 and led to the inhibition of JAK2.

SC99 downregulates STAT3-modulated gene
expression
As a key transcription factor, STAT3 modulates the
expression of a panel of key cell cycle regulators such

SC99 activates apoptotic signaling but it is
attenuated by overexpressed STAT3

and Bcl-xl was decreased by SC99 in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 5B). SC99 also downregulated
the expression of VEGF, another STAT3 substrate
gene (Figure 5C). All of these results thus further
demonstrated SC99 inhibited STAT3 activity.

To further evaluate SC99-induced cell apoptosis,
we evaluated PARP and caspase-3, two representative
hallmarks of cell apoptosis, in MM cells treated with
SC99. PARP was cleaved in all MM cell lines exa­
mined (Figure 7A), and this cleavage was concentrationdependent, in a manner similar to caspase-3 cleavage
(Figure 7B). These results indicated that cell apoptotic
signaling was activated by SC99. Because STAT3 was
demonstrated to be the target of SC99, we next questioned
whether the ectopic expression of STAT3 could rescue
cell death induced by SC99. OPM2 cells were transfected
a STAT3 plasmid before being treated with SC99.
Immunoblotting showed that SC99 induced a marked
cleavage of PARP in the cells which was partly abolished
by ectopic expression of STAT3 (Figure 7C). We also
evaluated cell death when STAT3 was knocked down.
STAT3 siRNA was infected into HeLa cells, 24 hrs later,
cells were treated with SC99 for another 24 hrs. As shown
in Figure 7D, STAT3 knockdown could slightly induce
PARP cleavage because STAT3 was still expressed at a
certain level, but cell death was markedly enhanced by
SC99 at which p-STAT3 was fully suppressed (Figure 7D).

SC99 induces MM cell apoptosis
Because JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway is
critical for MM cell survival, we next evaluated SC99induced cell death by Trypan blue exclusion and flow
cytometry. As shown in Figure 6A, SC99 induced
most of MM cell death within 72 hrs at 10 μM. A more
precise assay with Annexin V staining, a benchmark of
early apoptosis, was performed. As shown in Figure 6B,
more than 20% of cells underwent apoptosis after
treatment with SC99 for 24 hrs. To further evaluate
whether SC99 was effective in primary MM cells, a
colony forming assay was performed in bone marrow
cells from both healthy donors and MM patients. As
shown in Figure 6C, SC99 had no effects on colony
forming from healthy bone marrow cells, but markedly
suppressed colony forming in MM patients. These
results demonstrated that SC99 was toxic to MM cells
and it might affect MM cell self-renewal.

concentrations of SC99 for 24 hrs. After incubation, cells were harvested and total proteins were isolated for immunoblotting analysis

down tumor growth with a p value < 0.01 (Figure 8A). To
confirm this finding, another MM xenograft model was
established with OPM2 cells. The same treatment showed
that SC99 suppressed tumor growth more than 40% in 14
days in the OPM2 model (Figure 8B), which was similar
to that observed in the JJN3 model. However, there were
no significant differences in the body weight over the
experimental period in both models (Figure 8C and 8D).

Taken together, all these results further demonstrated that
SC99 induced cell apoptosis by targeting STAT3.

SC99 delays tumor growth in MM xenograft
models
To further evaluate the anti-myeloma efficacy of
SC99 in vivo, two independent human myeloma xenograft
models were established. One was established by s.c.
inoculation of JJN3 cells into nude mice because compared
with other MM cell lines, JJN3 was more adherent and
resistant to several drugs such as dexamethasone [21]
and it was easier to grow into a tumor in nude mice. Oral
administration of SC99 (30 mg/kg body weight every
day) led to a marked delay in tumor growth in 7 days
(p<0.05). On the 14th day, SC99 significantly slowed

DISCUSSION
In the above study, we identified a JAK2/STAT3
inhibitor that displays potent activity against MM in both
cellular and animal models.
Several key steps are involved in the modulation
of STAT3 activation. Upon stimulation, STAT3 is rapidly

phosphorylated at Tyr705 and forms a homo- or hetero-dimer
which subsequently translocates to the nuclei where it
binds to target genes and modulates their transcription. For
example, BP-1-102, a recently reported STAT3 inhibitor,
inhibits STAT3 activity by binding to the SH2 domain which
is critical for the formation of the STAT3 dimers through
reciprocal phosphotyrosine–SH2–binding interactions
[28]. S3I-1757, another small molecule also inhibits
STAT3 activity by this manner [29]. In our study, SC99
inhibit STAT3 activation and dimerization, which leads to
decreased p-STAT3 level and nuclear import as evidence
of immunofluorescent assay. However, different from
BP-1-102 and S3I-1757, SC99-induced STAT3 inhibition
is probably due to the inhibition of JAK2 activity. JAK2
is located at the upstream of STAT3 signaling pathway
and is the major activator of STAT3. Our study confirmed
this hypothesis because SC99 inhibits JAK2 activation but
not other closely related kinases, such as AKT, ERK and
c-Src, which is similar to previous studies [28]. Moreover,
computer modeling also found that SC99 is well fitted into
the active pocket of JAK2 and interacts with key amino acid

residues thus interfering with its activity. Therefore, SC99
displays potent inhibition on STAT3 activation probably via
the JAK2 kinase and SC99 is a JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor.
As a critical transcription factor, STAT3 modulates
the transcription and expression of a broad panel of
important genes, including angiogenic VEGF, prosurvival Bcl-2, Mcl-1, anti-apoptotic survivin and XIAP,
as well as cell cycle regulators, including cyclins,
cyclin-dependent kinase and transcription factor E2F-1.
Our study demonstrated that SC99 suppresses these
gene expressions. Importantly, these genes are also
involved in MM cell proliferation and progression and
chemoresistance [13, 30]. Bcl-2 is over-expressed in
MM cells and plays a “gatekeeper” role in control of
the integrity of mitochondrial membrane and blocks the
mitochondria-derived cell apoptosis [31]. D-type cyclins
are universally dysregulated in MM cells, and confer to
chemoresistance and poor prognosis [18, 32, 33]. By
inhibiting STAT3 activation and cell cycle regulators,
SC99 thus decreases proliferation and increases apoptosis
of MM cells. Moreover, SC99-activated apoptosis could

be partly abolished by ectopic expression of STAT3,
further suggests STAT3 is the target of SC99.
Safety is a critical factor in drug development, many
candidates are abandoned because of the safety issue. As
a critical transcription factor, STAT3 is also important
for normal biological activity in addition to cancer cells.
Disruption of STAT3 therefore is potentially toxic to
normal cells. However, our animal studies showed SC99
is not toxic but affects tumor growth. The cellular studies
also showed that SC99 prefers to suppress myeloma
cell growth and proliferation but does not affect normal
bone marrow cells. Therefore, SC99 is a relatively safe
candidate for myeloma therapy.
In summary, the present study identified a novel
JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor. Given its safety and efficacy in
vitro and in vivo, SC99 could be developed as a promising
oral active anti-myeloma drug, however, further extended
safety and therapeutic efficacy evaluation must be
performed.

Preparation of SC99 and analogs

Immunoblotting

SC99 is chemically named 2-(2-(3-chloro-4fluorophenyl)hydrazono)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-oxo-pro­
panenitrile. SC99 and its analogs were synthesized from
4-(trifluoro-methyl)benzoamine and 2-(2-thiophene­
Sulfonyl) acetonitrile. The detailed method was available
in Supplementary File 1. All chemicals were confirmed by
NMR and Mass spectrometry.

Cells after SC99 treatment were prepared for
immunoblotting according to our previous method
[35, 40]. A specific primary antibody against cyclin D2
(CCND2) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); antibodies against Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
Caspase-3, STAT3, p-STAT3(Tyr705), c-Src, p-Src,
JAK2, p-JAK2, E2F-1, AKT, p-AKT, ERK, p-ERK,
mTOR, p-mTOR, and PARP were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibodies against
VEGF, β-actin, α-tubulin, anti–mouse immunoglobulin
G (IgG) and anti–rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase
conjugated antibody were purchased from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN). Anti-Myc antibody and GAPDH was
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Luciferase assay
Specific luciferase constructs were transiently
introduced into HEK293 cells using 25 KD polyethylenimine
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) as described previously [36].
Luciferase activity evaluation was performed using a BrightGlo luciferase assay system (Promega) [21].

Immunofluorescence staining

Flow cytometry

The basic protocol for the analysis of p-STAT3
subcellular location was referred to our previous protocol
[35]. Briefly, OPM2 cells were starved overnight, followed
by incubation with SC99 or DMSO for 60 min. Cells were
then stimulated with 50 ng/ml of IL-6 for 20 min before
being harvested in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing
1 mM sodium orthovanadate. Cells were transferred
to polylysine-coated slides by cytospin and dried in air
for 20 min at room temperature. After being fixed in 2%
of paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized in
0.1% Triton-100 for 5 min, cells were blocked in TBS
containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 hr at room
temperature before being stained with STAT3 or p-STAT3
(Tyr705) overnight at 4°C. Then cells were gently washed
and incubated with FITC conjugated goat anti-rabbit
IgG (Beyotime Biotechnology Ltd). Finally, slides were
incubated with 5 μg/ml of 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI, Beyotime) for 10 min. The subcellular location and
relative abundance of STAT3 or p-STAT3 were immediately
analyzed with an Olympus confocal microscope.

To determine cell apoptosis, MM cells treated
with SC99 were stained with Annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (Annexin V-FITC) and propidium iodide
(PI, Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Stained cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer
(FACSCalibur®, Becton Dickinson). To determine cell
cycle, MM cells after SC99 treatment was stained with
PI and subsequent analysis on the flow cytometer as
described previously [34].

Cloning of the STAT3 gene
To clone STAT3, total RNA was prepared from
U266 cells and used for the synthesis of the first strand
cDNA in a cDNA reaction system (TransGen Biotech,
Beijing, China). The STAT3 gene was then cloned into a
pcDNA3.1 vector with a Myc or a Flag tag using primers:
5′-CCCAAGCTTATGGCCCAATGGAATCAGCTACAG
-3′ (Forward primer) and 5′-CATCTCGAGTCACATGG
GGGAGGTAGCGCACT-3′ (Reverse primer). STAT3
siRNA was designed and provided by Genepharm Co. Ltd,
Suzhou, China.

Colony forming assay
To assess clonogenic growth in bone marrow cells
(6.25 X 105/mL) from primary MM patients or healthy
donors, a colony forming unit assay was performed as
described previously [34]. Cells treated with SC99 or
buffer control for 24 hrs were washed and equal volumes
were plated in triplicate in MethoCult GF H4434 medium
(StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC) containing 1%
methycellulose in IMDM, 30% FCS, 1% bovine serum
albumin, 3 U/mL of recombinant human erythropoietin,
0.1 mM of 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM of L-glutamine,
50 ng/mL of recombinant human stem cell factor, 10 ng/
mL of GM-CSF, and 10 ng/mL of rh IL-3. Seven days
(AML samples) or 14 days (normal PBCS) after plating,
the number of colonies containing 20 or more cells was
counted as described previously [34].

Molecular docking
The structure of SC99 was constructed in Schrodinger
(version 09) and then preprocessed with the LigPrep
module. The structure of JAK2 (PDB ID: 3UGC) was
used as the initial structure. All crystallographic water
molecules were removed, hydrogen atoms were added,
and the structure was submitted to restrained minimization
to relieve steric clashes using the OPLS2005 force field
within the Protein Preparation Wizard in Schrodinger. The
minimization was terminated when the root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) reached a maximum value of 0.3 Å.
For the grid generation and ligand docking procedures,
the default settings were used and the Glide module in the
Schrodinger was employed for molecular docking [37–39].

Two MM xenograft models were established with
human MM cell line JJN3 and OPM2, respectively, as
described previously [35] . Thirty million of MM cells
were injected subcutaneously in the right flanks of each
nude mouse (5-6 weeks old, female, Shanghai Slac
Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd.). When tumors were palpable,
mice were randomly divided into two groups, one was
given SC99 (30 mg/kg body weight) in PBS containing
10% Tween 80 and 10% DMSO daily, another group was
received the vehicle only. Tumor sizes and body weight
were monitored every day [34]. This xenograft study was
approved by the Review Board on Experimental Animals
of Soochow University.
