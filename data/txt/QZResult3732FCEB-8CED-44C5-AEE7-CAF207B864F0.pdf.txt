ABSTRACT
Although protein kinase D (PKD) has been shown to contribute to invasion and
metastasis in several types of cancer, the role of PKD in the epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has remained unclear. We found
that PKD2 is up-regulated in HCC and is correlated with the metastasis of HCC. PKD2
positively regulated TNF-α-induced EMT and metastasis of HCC. Mechanistic studies
revealed TNF-α-induced PKD2 activation is mediated by the formation of a TNFR1/
TRAF2 complex. PKD2 bound directly to the p110α and p85 subunits of PI3K and
promoted the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling cascade to stimulate EMT. In conclusion,
our results have uncovered a novel role for the regulation of EMT and suggest
inhibition of PKD2 as a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC.

INTRODUCTION

Once activated, PKD isoforms primarily activate pathways
including NF-κB, MAPK and CREB to mediate a cascade
of reactions [4, 7]. However, the expression and role of
PKD isoforms have not been well characterized in HCC.
As a critical proinflammatory cytokine, tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) acts as a master switch in
establishing the intricate link between hepatitis and HCC
[8]. In several cancer cells, TNF-α has been shown to play
an important role in the epithelial mesenchymal transition
(EMT) [9, 10]. However, whether TNF-α can stimulate
EMT and invasion in HCC cells remains unclear.
The primary goal of this study was to investigate
the function and regulatory mechanisms of the PKDmediated signal pathway in TNF-α induced HCC cell
EMT and invasion. The relationship between PKD and
HCC metastasis was also discussed.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most
common malignancy worldwide [1]. HCC prognosis
is poor due to the high possibility of metastasis and
recurrence [2]. It is of critical importance to identify the
molecular mechanisms regulating the invasiveness and
metastatic potential of HCC.
Protein kinase D (PKD) is a newly described serine/
threonine kinase belonging to the calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase superfamily. PKD regulates cell
proliferation, survival, migration, and particularly invasion
[3, 4]. The PKD family is composed of three members,
namely PKD1(PKCμ), PKD2 and PKD3(PKCv), which
can be activated by multiple stimuli, such as tumorpromoting phorbol esters, G protein-coupled receptor
agonists and growth factors. PKD isoforms are activated
via the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of a highly
conserved serine pair (Ser-744 and Ser-748) in the
activation loop, following by being phosphorylated at
the auto-phosphorylation sites Ser-916 or Ser-876 [5, 6].

PKD2 is a key regulator in TNF-α-mediated EMT
in HCC cells

for phospho-PKD2 (p-PKD2) was evaluated in 40 liver
tumor tissues and 20 non-tumor liver tissues from clinical
HCC patients. The percentage of p-PKD2-positively
stained cells increased from 18% for normal liver to 57%
for liver cancer, and this difference was highly significant
(Figure 1C). Moreover, compared with the tumor with
no recurrence potential, the expression of p-PKD2 in
recurrent tumor was significantly higher, and there was a
moderate correlation between the positive rate of p-PKD2
and the recurrence status of the patients (Figure 1D). At
the cellular level, the expression of PKD2 and p-PKD2
was significantly higher in HCC cell lines compared with
the immortalized human liver cell line L02. Cell lines
with high invasive potential (SK-Hep-1 and MHCC97-H)
showed higher PKD2 and p-PKD2 expression levels than
those with low invasive potential (HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B
and MHCC97-L) (Figure 1E). These data suggest that
PKD2 is expressed at a high level in both HCC cells and
tissues.

Previous reports have identified that TNF-α
stimulates EMT in many cancer cells. Consistently,
we found that TNF-α treatment markedly increased
the motility and invasiveness of both HepG2 and SKHep-1 cells (Supplementary Figure S3A and B). TNF-α
was also shown to stimulate EMT in a dose- and timedependent manner (Supplementary Figure S3C). Even
more importantly, we observed that p-PKD2 expression
gradually increased with time in the presence of TNF-α
(Figure 3A), indicating that PKD2 can be activated by
TNF-α.
We next examined the alterations of invasiveness
and EMT phenotype following the knock down of PKD2
in the present of TNF-α. Transwell assays showed that
depletion of PKD2 significantly reduced the number of
cells that invaded through the Matrigel in the presence of
TNF-α (Figure 3B). Western blot and immunofluorescence
showed that depletion of PKD2 rescued the expression
of epithelial markers and blocked the up-regulated
expression of mesenchymal markers in response to TNF-α
(Figure 3C and 3D). We further performed overexpression
assays to verify the role of PKD2 in TNF-α induced EMT.
Overexpression of PKD2 in HCC cells markedly increased
the expression of mesenchymal markers and suppressed
the expression of epithelial markers (Figure 3E and 3F).
Overall, these results confirm that PKD2 may be crucial
for TNF-α-induced EMT in HCC cells. Our study also
showed that HCC cells treated by TNF-α developed
strengthened anchorage-independent growth ability
while knock down of PKD2 inhibited the anchorageindependent growth (Supplementary Figure S4A). IHC
assay revealed no correlation between PKD2 and Ki67
or VEGF-A in clinical HCC samples (data not shown).
Neither treatment of TNF-α nor depletion of PKD2 can
change transcript level of VEGF-A (Supplementary Figure
S4B). These results imply that PKD2 may not have effect
on proliferation and angiogenesis in HCC.

PKD2 contributes to EMT phenotype and
invasiveness of HCC
To explore whether PKD2 affects EMT and
invasiveness of HCC, we monitored the change of EMT
phenotype as well as the invasiveness by regulating
PKD2. Down-regulation of PKD2 led to the suppression
of migration (Figure 2A) and invasion (Figure 2B) in the
highly metastatic HCC cell line SK-Hep-1. Moreover,
down-regulation of PKD2 increased the expression
of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and ZO-1) while it
decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers
(N-cadherin and vimentin) (Figure 2C and 2D). However,
the down-regulation of PKD1 and PKD3 has no effect
on the migration, invasion or EMT phenotype of HCC
cells. This further confirms that it is PKD2, not PKD1
or PKD3 that stimulates EMT and invasion of HCC. A
mouse model of pulmonary metastasis was established
using SK-Hep-1 to detect the in vivo effect of PKD2
inhibitor (CRT0066101) on EMT and invasiveness of
HCC. CRT0066101 treatment resulted in a suppression
of p-PKD2 in both the primary tumor nodules and the
metastasis tumor nodules (Supplementary Figure S2A
and B). CRT0066101 also significantly decreased the
incidence of pulmonary metastases (Figure 2E). Moreover,
the expression of vimentin was significantly inhibited
by CRT0066101 in the metastasis nodule in the lung,
which consistent with our in vitro results (Figure 2F).
Collectively, these data suggest that PKD2 promotes
EMT and invasion and PKD inhibitor can inhibit EMT
and invasion in HCC.

TNF-α-induced PKD2 activation is mediated by
the formation of a TNFR1/TRAF2 complex
To investigate whether TNFR1 mediates TNF-αinduced PKD2 phosphorylation, we assessed the effect
of modulation of TNFR1 on p-PKD2 expression in HCC
cells. As illustrated in Figure 4A, depletion of TNFR1
attenuated TNF-α-dependent high expression of p-PKD2.
TNFR associated factor (TRAF) family combine with
TNFR1 to mediate TNF-α induced signaling pathways [16,
17]. We further investigated which of the TRAF isoforms
participated in activation of PKD2. The presence of TNFα-induced formation of TNFR1/TRAF complex was
revealed by immunoprecipitation. We observed that only

TRAF2 can be detected in a TNFR1-immunoprecipitated
complex. Immunoprecipitation using a TRAF2 antibody
confirmed the interaction between TNFR1 and TRAF2
(Figure 4B). Furthermore, phosphorylation of PKD2
was significantly reduced after transfection with TRAF2
siRNA in HCC cell lines (Figure 4C). As a PKD upstream
kinase, PKCδ has been shown to associate with TNF-

receptor. We sought to assess the role of PKCδ in TNFαinduced activation of PKD2 by using siPKCδ. We showed
that knockdown of PKCδ partly abolished TNFα-induced
PKD2 activation in HCC cells (Figure 4D).
Collectively, these data indicate that TNF-α triggers
the association between TNFR1 and TRAF2 to induce
activation of PKD2 in HCC cells and PKCδ serves as the

up-stream of PKD2.

PI3K/AKT is a key upstream regulator of GSK-3β in HCC
in addition to PKD2.
To explore the underlying association between
PKD2 and PI3K/AKT, we assessed the effect of
modulation of PKD2 on PI3K/AKT pathway.
Overexpression of PKD2 fully activated whereas depletion
of endogenous PKD2 impaired phosphorylation of AKT
and p85 in HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cell lines (Figure 6C and
6D). However, the level of PKD2 and p-PKD2 remained
stable when endogenous AKT1/2 was depleted by siRNA
(Figure 6E). Immunoprecipitation assays showed that two
main subunits of PI3K, p110α and p85 directly interacted
with PKD2, and this interaction increased in response to
TNF-α (Figure 6F). Taken together, these data suggest
that PKD2 regulates the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway by
directly binding to PI3K.

PKD2 positively regulates GSK-3β/β-catenin
pathway in TNF-α induced EMT
Aberrant activation of GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway
leads to enhanced EMT in various cancer cells [18-21]. We
therefore examined whether GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway is
involved in TNF-α induced invasion and EMT in HCC.
In HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cell lines, the phosphorylation
of GSK-3β was elevated in a time-dependent manner in
response to TNF-α, as was the level of β-catenin in the
nucleus (Figure 5A). The use of LiCl, an effective inhibitor
of GSK-3β phosphorylation, dramatically decreased the
expression of N-cadherin but elevated E-cadherin level
in HCC cell lines (Figure 5B). The results of Transwell
assays further showed that LiCl inhibited HCC cell
invasion (Supplementary Figure S5). These data suggest
that GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway is activated in TNF-α
induced EMT in HCC.
Following, we detected the effect of PKD2 on GSK3β/β-catenin pathway. Depletion of PKD2 led to decreased
phosphorylation of GSK-3β as well as the nuclear
accumulation of β-catenin in HCC cell lines (Figure 5C
and 5D). Meanwhile, increased phosphorylation of GSK3β was observed in PKD2-overexpressed cells along with
the increased nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (Figure
5E). As the transcription factor TCF/LEF1 is under
negative control of GSK3β, we measured the effect of
depletion of LEF1 on PKD2-overexpressed HCC cells
to further confirm the extent of regulation by GSK3β/β-catenin pathway. Suppression of LEF-1 by siRNA
significantly reversed EMT phenotype (Figures 5F). These
data together corroborate the positive regulation of PKD2
on GSK-3β/β-catenin signal pathway in TNF-α-induced
EMT.

DISSCUSSION
The PKD family has been shown to regulate
oncogenic progression [4, 14, 26]. The expression patterns
and effects of PKD isoforms differ among various types
of cancer. PKD1 is reported to play an inhibitory role in
cell migration and invasion of several malignancy [2730]. PKD2 and PKD3 are overexpressed in some highly
invasive cancer cells and are demonstrated to accelerate
cancer cell invasion through the AKT, ERK and NFκB signaling pathways [4, 14, 26, 31]. However, the
expression and function of PKD isoforms in HCC has
never been established. In the current study, PKD2 and
p-PKD2 was overexpressed in HCC tissue and HCC
cell lines. The level of p-PKD2 was correlated with the
recurrence status and the invasiveness of HCC. Animal
study demonstrated that inhibition of PKD2 decreased
lung metastasis of subcutaneously implanted HCC cells
in nude mice. Our findings identify that among the PKD
isoforms, PKD2 plays a pivotal role in HCC invasion and
metastasis.
HCC progression is a stepwise process accompanied
by complex events. EMT is a key event in invasion and
metastasis of HCC. We found that PKD2 may act as a key
regulator of invasion and metastasis by inducing EMT
in HCC cells. This is supported by the fact that ectopic
expression of PKD2 promotes, whereas knockdown
of PKD2 reverses EMT features, including a change in
the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers
in HCC cells. Anchorage-independent growth is also an
in vitro marker for a malignant phenotype. We found
that PKD2 also played a positive regulatory role in the
anchorage independent colony formation of HCC. PKD2
has also been shown to regulate proliferation as well as
angiogenesis of tumors [32]. In contrast with these studies,
our findings suggest no correlation between PKD2 and
proliferation or angiogenesis in HCC.
TNF-α is a proinflammatory cytokine that is
highly expressed in HCC [33]. No previous studies have

PKD2 binds to PI3K subunits to stimulate TNF-α
induced activation of AKT/GSK-3β
We explored the precise mechanism by which
PKD2 regulates GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway in HCC. As
AKT, ERK, 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K1) and
PKD have been demonstrated to be upstream regulators
of GSK-3β in different cellular contexts [22-25], we thus
evaluated which pathways are required for TNF-α induced
phosphorylation of GSK-3β in HCC cells. Inhibitors of
the above pathways were used. As shown in Figure 6A,
among the inhibitors studied, only LY294002 (a PI3K/Akt
pathway inhibitor) and Kb-NB-142-70 (a PKD inhibitor)
profoundly inhibited the phosphorylation of GSK-3β.
Furthermore, as shown in Figure 6B, both LY294002 and
Kb-NB-142-70 inhibited the expression of mesenchymal
markers while stimulated the expression of epithelial
makers in TNF-α induced EMT. These data indicate that

cells. Our study provides evidence that TNF-α induces
EMT as well as the migratory and invasive abilities of
HCC cells. Furthermore, PKD2 can be activated by TNF-α

and the regulation of PKD2 expression resulted in the
alteration of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes in
HCC cell lines, implying that PKD2 may have a positive

TNF-α activates intracellular signal transduction
pathways via either of the two membrane receptors,
TNFR1 or TNFR2 [34, 35]. Unlike TNFR2, TNFR1
is expressed on almost all cell types, and most of the
actions of TNF-α are mediated through TNFR1 [36, 37].
The TRAF family is recruited to the cytoplasmic tails
of both TNFRs, and interacts with a variety of proteins
to mediate receptor-induced signal transduction [38].
Our study revealed that in HCC cells, TNF-α triggers
the association between TNFR1 and TRAF2 which is
required for PKD2 activation and the EMT process. PKC
is known to phosphorylate the conserved serine residues
in the activation loop of PKD and activate PKD. PKCδ, a
member of novel PKC, has been shown to associate with
TNF-receptor and be involved in the TNF-anti-apoptotic
signaling cascade [39]. In accordance with these studies,
we found that PKCδ serves as the upstream of PKD2
and is involved in PKD2 activation by TNF-α. This is
the first time that the relationship between TNF-α and
PKD2 is disclosed in which TNF-α activates PKCδ/PKD2
via phosphorylation PKD2 through the TNFR1/TRAF2
pathway.
During tumorigenesis, EMT is associated with
aberrant activation of canonical Wnt or the PI3K/AKT

pathway, which inactivates GSK-3β and stabilizes
β-catenin or Snail, respectively [40, 41]. Our data suggest
that PKD2 induces GSK-3β phosphorylation and further
induces the translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus
to regulate LEF/TCF-dependent transcription to trigger
EMT in HCC cells. Moreover, ectopic PKD2 expression
increased while the depleted PKD2 expression decreased
the phosphorylation of AKT and p85. In addition, we
identify a previously unrecognized mechanism for direct
regulation of PI3K in HCC. Endogenous PKD2 could
directly interact with the p110α and p85 subunits of PI3K
to activate PI3K/AKT, which could be enhanced by TNF-α
stimulation.
In summary, this study has shown for the first time
that PKD2 regulates EMT and invasiveness of HCC and
the expression of PKD2 is related to the metastasis and
recurrence potential of HCC. Our findings identify a
previously unrecognized mechanism for PKD2 regulated
EMT. PKD2 directly associates with p110α and p85
subunits of PI3K. The constitutive association of PKD2/
PI3K complex enhanced by TNF-α increases activity
of AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin and promotes EMT and
invasiveness of HCC (Figure 7). Our study provides a new
potential strategy for HCC therapy.

Figure 7: Model describing the proposed role of PKD in the control of TNF-α-induced EMT signaling in HCC. TNF-α

promotes activation of PKD2 and facilitats the formation of PKD2/PI3K complex via forming TNFR1/TRAF2 complex and thereby
accelerates GSK3β/β-catenin pathway.

Transwell assay
The upper chamber of the Transwell inserts
was coated with 50 μL of 2.0 mg/mL Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) before use. 5
× 104 cells, cultured in 200 μL DMEM, were seeded in
the upper chamber of the Transwell insert, while 600 μL
medium with 10% FBS was used in the lower chamber.
Cells were cultured for 24 hours. All cells that invaded to
the underside of the membrane were fixed and dyed using
crystal violet. Six random fields of view were selected to
count the cells, and the mean value was calculated from
three independent experiments.

Wound-healing assay

Plasmids and RNA interference

Cells were seeded onto 24-well plates and grown
to confluence. After serum starvation in medium for 12
hours, cells were gently wounded using a pipette tip.
Wounded cells were immediately treated as indicated.
Images were taken immediately after wounding and
after 24 hours. The motility of cells was assessed by the
distance between the wound edges.

GFP-PKD2 vectors were kindly provided by Dr.
Yasuharu Nishimura and Dr. Atsushi Irie (Kumamoto
University, Japan). Negative control siRNAs, as well
as PKD2 siRNA, Akt siRNA , TNFR1 siRNA, TRAF2
siRNA, GSK-3β siRNA and PKCδ siRNA were received
from Cell Signaling Technology.

Soft agar assay

Cell culture, drug treatment and transfections

1×104 pre-treated HCC cells were plated in growth
medium containing 0.4% agarose in six-well plates onto
a bottom layer of solidified medium containing 0.8%
agarose. After incubation for 14 days, colonies were
stained with crystal violet solution, washed repeatedly
with distilled water. Viable colonies larger than 0.1 mm
were counted.

HepG2, SK-Hep-1, L02, MHCC97-H, MHCC97-L
and Huh7 cells were obtained from the Oncology
Laboratory of Southern Medical University. Cells were
cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Life Technologies
Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and supplemented
with 10% FBS in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Cells at 70-80% confluence were maintained in serumfree DMEM for 12 hours before stimulation with TNF-α.
Inhibitors were given 30 minutes before TNF-α treatment,
if needed. For transient transfection, cells were transfected
with plasmid or siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunofluorescence microscopy
After treatment, cells were fixed in methanol for 15
minutes and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for
5 minutes at room temperature and rinsed in PBS with
3% bovine serum albumin. After blocking in PBST buffer
for 1 hour at room temperature, cells were incubated with

overnight at 4°C. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and
subsequently incubated with Alexa-488- or Alexa-594conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room
temperature. The slides were mounted in ProLong Gold
Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) and imaged
with a Nikon Eclipse E400 fluorescent microscope.

and histological data are shown in Table 1. The
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and hematoxylin and eosin
(HE) staining were performed as described before[14],
antibody against phospho-PKD2 (p-PKD2), PKD2, Ki67
and VEGF-A was used. Images were captured using
ImagePro software. Two experienced researchers counted
the immune-positive cells in a blinded manner.

Microarray dataset analysis

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR

A study involving 236 HCC patients, representing
the largest number of subjects reported in the database
were selected from NCI caArray database[13].The
expression levels of PKD1, PKD2 and PKD3 in tumor
tissue were determined and compared. Then, PKD2 and
PKD3 expression in HCC and non-tumoral liver tissues
was compared. The correlation between the expression of
PKD2 and predicted metastasis risk was also determined.

Total RNA was extracted from treated HCC cell
lines with Trizol reagent following the protocol. The
mRNA was reverse-transcribed from 500 ng of total
RNA with Prime Script RT reagent kit (Takara Bio Inc.).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR of VEGF-A was carried out
by specific primers using Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time
(Takara Bio Inc.) according to the protocol. The primers
used for quantitative PCR are listed in Supplementary
Table S1.

was established as previously described[15]. Tumorbearing mice were randomly split into CON and CRT
groups (n = 6) and were treated by gavage with either 5%
dextrose (vehicle) or CRT0066101 (80 mg/kg dissolved
in 5% dextrose) once daily. 4 weeks later, the mice were
euthanized. Subcutaneous tumors were harvested for
western blot analysis. Consecutive tissue sections were
made for the lung and stained with HE. The number
of lung metastatic nodules was counted under the
microscope. The specimens of liver were immuno-stained
using antibodies to p-PKD2 and vimentin.
