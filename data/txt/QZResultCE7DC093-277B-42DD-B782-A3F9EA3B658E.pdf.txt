ABSTRACT
End-binding 1 protein (EB1) is a key player in the regulation of microtubule
(MT) dynamics. Here, we investigated the role of EB1 in glioblastoma (GBM)
tumor progression and its potential predictive role for response to Vinca-alkaloid
chemotherapy. Immunohistological analysis of the 109 human GBM cases revealed
that EB1 overexpression correlated with poor outcome including progression-free
survival and overall survival. Downregulation of EB1 by shRNA inhibited cell migration
and proliferation in vitro. Conversely, EB1 overexpression promoted them and
accelerated tumor growth in orthotopically-transplanted nude mice. Furthermore,
EB1 was largely overexpressed in stem-like GBM6 that display in vivo a higher
tumorigenicity with a more infiltrative pattern of migration than stem-like GBM9.
GBM6 showed strong and EB1-dependent migratory potential. The predictive role of
EB1 in the response of GBM cells to chemotherapy was investigated. Vinflunine and
vincristine increased survival of EB1-overexpressing U87 bearing mice and were more
effective to inhibit cell migration and proliferation in EB1-overexpressing clones than
in controls. Vinca inhibited the increase of MT growth rate and growth length induced
by EB1 overexpression. Altogether, our results show that EB1 expression level has
a prognostic value in GBM, and that Vinca-alkaloid chemotherapy could improve the
treatment of GBM patients with EB1-overexpressing tumor.

in MT-mediated cell functions, such as cell division,
migration and morphogenesis. MT constitute a
longstanding, important and effective target for anticancer drugs so-called Microtubule-Targeting Agents
(MTA). MTA, including Vinca-alkaloids, taxanes and
epothilones, are known to alter MT dynamic instability
that is defined by growth to shrinkage transitions
(catastrophes) and reverse transitions (rescues).
However, the involvement of the proteins regulating
MT plus-end dynamics in tumorigenesis and in drug
response is still poorly understood. This question is very
relevant in glioblastoma (GBM) cells, which motility is

INTRODUCTION
End-binding 1 protein (EB1) is an evolutionary
conserved protein that preferentially localizes to
the plus-ends of growing microtubules (MT). EB1
is the prototypic member of MT plus-end tracking
proteins (+TIPs), which controls MT dynamics
and links MTs to several cellular structures such
as kinetochores and cell cortex [1–3]. EB1 directly
interacts with many other +TIPs and is therefore
central to the assembly of +TIPs complexes at MT
plus-ends. With its binding partners, EB1 participates

a microtubule-dependent and actin polymer-independent
process [4]. We previously demonstrated that the antimigratory effects of epothilone B on GBM cells occurred
through an EB1-dependent mechanism and through
MT catastrophe induction [5]. Such mechanism has
also been described in GBM and endothelial cells with
vinflunine (VFL) from the Vinca-alkaloid family [6].
A recent in vitro study with purified tubulin suggests
that EB proteins sensitize MT to the action of MTA, by
promoting MT catastrophes [7].
EB1 overexpression and its bad prognostic value
have been described in several cancers, including breast
cancer [8], esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [9],
gastric adenocarcinoma [10], colorectal cancer [11] and
hepatocellular carcinoma [12, 13].
GBM, the most common and malignant form of
gliomas, is characterized by highly aggressive growth,
and its invasive behavior that accounts for the poor
overall survival (OS) of patients [14]. Current standard
therapy following maximal safe removal consists of
concomitant radio-chemotherapy with temozolomide
(TMZ), an alkylating agent. Such regimen confers
a median survival period of only 14.6 months
and new therapeutic options are warranted [14].
Vinca-alkaloids are currently used in brain tumor
treatment, more particularly vincristine (VCR), in
combination with the alkylating agents procarbazine
and lomustine for anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and
oligoastrocytomas [15].
Here, we investigated the role of EB1 in GBM tumor
progression and its potential predictive role for response
to chemotherapy. We show that EB1 expression level has
a prognostic value in GBM, and that Vinca-chemotherapy
could improve the treatment of GBM patients with EB1overexpressing tumor.

EB1 overexpression correlates with poor overall
survival and progression-free survival in patients
with GBM
EB1 expression was examined in human GBM tissue
specimens coming from 109 GBM patient cohort (Table 1).
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using clone
5 anti-EB1 antibody (BD Bioscience) and isotype Ig as
negative control. The EB1 expression appeared in the form
of a cytoplasmic staining pattern (Fig. 1A). Scores were
assigned as described in material and methods. EB1 staining
and scores were validated by using another antibody against
EB1 (clone H-70, Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) (not shown).
Analysis of GBM tissue specimens revealed that out of the
109 tissues specimens examined, 22 were scored 0 (21%),
28 were scored 1+ (27%), 38 were scored 2+ (36%) and
17 were scored 3+ (16%). In univariate analysis, a higher
EB1 expression was correlated to poor OS (p < 0.001) and
poor PFS (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B, C). Median OS and PFS
for each EB1 scoring are shown in Supplementary table 1.
By multivariate analysis adjusted by KPs and gender
(Table 2), EB1 expression remained significant both for
OS (p < 0.001, Hazard Ratio: 1.583) and PFS (p = 0.001,
Hazard Ratio: 1.458).
When tested on lower grades of glioma, EB1 was
not detectable or weakly expressed. Indeed, only 6.0%
(2/33) pilocytic astrocytoma samples were positively
stained (score 1+), and all anaplastic astrocytoma samples
tested (0/40) were negative (score 0) (not shown).
Interestingly, the other proteins of EB1 family, EB2
and EB3, were expressed independently to EB1 scores in
the 42 GBM tissue specimens analyzed (Supplementary
Figure 1).

p < 0.005) (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, introduction of siRNA
against EB1 in EB1-overexpressing clones rescued the
normal phenotype. Indeed, EB1 siRNA strongly reduced
EB1 expression of U87 P11, 72 hours post transfection
(Fig. 3D). EB1 silencing significantly decreased U87
P11 cell migration, which returned to U87 P0 basal level
(percentage of migrating U87 P11 cells was reduced by
35.1 ± 4.4%) (Fig. 3E). Moreover, migration of astrocytes,
with undetectable level of EB1, was significantly
lower than U87-MG and U251-MG glioblastoma
cells (−76.4  ±  4.5% versus U87-MG cells, p < 0.001)
(Supplementary Figure 2C and D).
In addition, the involvement of EB1 in the
migration of the two stem-like cells was investigated.
We confirmed the strong migrating potential for
GBM6 which was significantly higher than for GBM9
(194.5 ± 4.0% in GBM6 vs 100% for GBM9) (Fig. 3G)
that has been previously described by using the woundhealing assay [16]. Moreover, EB1 down-regulation in
GBM6 significantly abrogated migration by 52.9 ± 1.5%
(Fig.  3F,  G). Altogether, our data show that EB1
overexpression leads to a pro-migratory phenotype in
U87-MG cells as well as in GBM stem-like cells.
We next investigated the effect of EB1 expression
on U87 cell proliferation using the BrdU staining assay.
As shown in Fig. 4A, shRNA-mediated knockdown
of EB1 expression slightly inhibited cell proliferation
(−12.3 ± 0.9%, p < 0.05 and −23.5 ± 3.7%, p < 0.05
for U87 sh11 and sh12, respectively). Conversely, EB1
overexpression significantly promoted cell proliferation
(+28.3 ± 2.1%, +55.7 ± 11.3% and +104.1 ± 8.2%
for U87 P16, P11 and P15, respectively) (Fig. 4B).
Together, these data revealed a positive and statistically
significant correlation between the level of expression of
EB1 in U87-MG cells and their proliferation rate (linear
regression, R² = 0.9680, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4E), suggesting
that EB1 is involved in U87 cell proliferation. The
EB1 expression-dependent effect on proliferation was
confirmed on cell growth by using the sulforhodamine B
staining assay (Fig. 4C and D). Indeed, in the 3 shRNA
clones with 2-fold lower EB1 expression, the doubling

In order to analyze the influence of EB1 expression
in GBM tumor progression we generated six U87 stable
clones deficient for EB1 (U87 sh4, sh11 and sh12) or
overexpressing it (U87 P11, P15 and P16). Control clones
U87 sh0 and P0 were generated with respective empty
control vectors. EB1 expression level (ratio to GAPDH
relative to U87-MG wt) in U87 sh4, sh11 and sh12 was
around 2-fold lower than that in U87 sh0 control or U87MG wt cells. Conversely, in overexpressing-EB1 clones
U87 P16, P11 and P15, the EB1/GAPDH ratio relative
to U87-MG wt was respectively 3.6, 7.4 and 14.2 fold
higher than in U87 P0 control or U87-MG wt cells
(Fig. 2A). Modulations of EB1 expression in clones had
no effect on the protein level of other EB family members
or on the level of tubulin (Supplementary Fig. 1). EB1
expression was confirmed in several GBM cell lines
(U251-MG, U118-MG, U138-MG and GL15) and also
in GBM stem-like cells isolated from 2 GBM patients
(GBM6 and GBM9) [16] (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, EB1
expression level was almost 17-fold higher in GBM6
that is highly tumorigenic, as compared with GBM9 [17].
Finally, EB1 was not detected in human normal astrocytes
(Supplementary Figure 2). Typical comet-like staining
of EB1 was observed in U87 sh0 and P0 control cells
(Fig. 2C). EB1 was barely visible in EB1 down-regulated
clones as shown in U87 sh11, and stained in the entire
length of MT in EB1 overexpressing clones without any
MT bundling as illustrated with U87 P11.
Implication of EB1 expression level in GBM
cell migration was assessed by using a transwell assay
(Fig.  3A, B). The knockdown of EB1 expression
significantly decreased cell migration (−22.5 ± 2.8%,
−33.2 ± 1.4% and −47.3 ± 2.4% for U87 sh11, sh4 and
sh12, respectively), whereas overexpression of EB1
increased it (+41.6 ± 5.6% and +118.3 ± 6.2% for U87
P11 and P15, respectively). The level of EB1 expression
in U87-MG clones was significantly correlated with
their migrating potential (linear regression, R² = 0.9496,

significantly decreased by around 15% at 96 hours. In
contrast, EB1 overexpression decreased the doubling time
in a EB1-dependent manner (−1%, −16.6% and −25.9%
for U87 P16, P11 and P15, respectively) and significantly
promoted cell growth (+6.4 ± 2.5%, +21.6 ± 3.0% and

down-regulation of EB1 significantly decreased viability
of U87 P11 cells by 12.5 ± 3.3%, thus rescuing partially
the normal U87 P0 phenotype (Fig. 4F). Proliferation of
astrocytes, that display undetectable staining of EB1, was
also significantly lower than U87-MG and U251-MG
glioblastoma cells (−59.61 ± 8.6% versus U87-MG cells
at 96 hours, p < 0.001) (Supplementary Figure 2). Our
results show that besides cell migration, EB1 expression
level affects GBM cell proliferation.

EB1 overexpression increases tumor growth in
an orthotopic mouse model of GBM

(Supplementary Figure 3). The clinical condition of the
mice was monitored daily. Weight loss was more rapid
for mice bearing overexpressing EB1 tumors (Fig. 5C).
Consequently, survival for these animals was strongly
and significantly reduced (30.5 days for U87 P11 bearing
mice vs 46 days for controls, p < 0.001) (Fig. 5D). Our
previous work showing that GBM6 which overexpress
EB1 gave rise to huge tumors when injected into brain,
strengthens the current study [17].
Conversely, when mice were grafted with EB1
down-regulated U87 sh12 clone, size of tumors was
significantly reduced at post transplant days 14, 21 and
28 (−98.0 ± 1.4% at day 14, −86.8 ± 6.3% at day 21 and
−62.3 ± 14.9% at day 28, as compared with control U87
sh0 bearing mice) (Fig. 5E, F). Weight loss was delayed
and survival was significantly higher (survival gain of
6.5 days, p < 0.005) (Fig. 5G, H).

To confirm in vivo the effect of EB1 on GBM tumor
progression, control U87 P0 or EB1 overexpressing
U87 P11 clones were transplanted by stereotaxy in the
striatum of nude mice. At post transplant days 14, 21
or 28, animals were euthanized and serial coronal brain
sections were stained with HE, then the size of the tumor
was calculated by morphometry by using all the sections.
Relative to control tumors, those overexpressing EB1
were significantly more extended and the volume was
increased at post transplant day 14 by 682.2 ± 316.1%,
day 21 by 281.7 ± 32.9% and day 28 by 113.3 ± 17.2%
(Fig. 5A, B). Ki-67 staining confirm that EB1
overexpression increased proliferation rate of U87 P11
tumors (+56.5 ± 8.2 % versus U87 P0 tumors, p < 0.05)

Response to Vinca-alkaloid treatment is
enhanced in animals with EB1 overexpressing
GBM cells orthotopically xenografted

assessed the effect of EB1 expression on the antimigratory properties of both VFL and VCR. VFL inhibited
U87 P0 and U87 P15 cell migration in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 7A, C). Interestingly, inhibition was more
pronounced in EB1 overexpressing U87 P15 clone.
Indeed, 6 nM VFL failed to alter control cell migration
whereas it inhibited U87 P15 cell migration (−57 ± 1.9%).
This result has been confirmed with EB1 overexpressing
U87 P11 clone (−39.4 ± 9.5%) (Fig. 7B, D). Moreover,
at higher concentrations of VFL, inhibition of migration
was more efficient in U87 P15 than in U87 P0 cells
(Fig. 7A, C). These data demonstrate that EB1 expression
level in GBM cells modulates VFL anti-migratory effect.
EB1 overexpression also sensitized cells to VCR in U87
P15 cells (−56.7 ± 2.1% vs −43.3 ± 6.0% for U87 P15 and
U87 P0, respectively) (Fig. 7A, C) and in U87 P11 cells
(−60.0 ± 1.9 % vs −41.9 ± 4.1 % for U87 P11 and U87 P0,
respectively) (Fig. 7B, D). In contrast, we did not detect
any significant difference of the anti-migratory effect of
TMZ according to EB1 expression (Fig. 7B, D).
Further, we conducted a dose response cytotoxic
activity assay of VFL on the two overexpressing-EB1 U87MG clones after 72 hours of treatment (Fig. 7E). The drug
concentration required to reduce viability by 50% (EC50)
was 10.6 ± 1.8 nM for U87 P11 and 7.0 ± 1.8 nM for U87
P15 in comparison with 38.0 ± 1.5 nM for control U87 P0.
Moreover, the concentration of VCR required to reduce
viability by 50% (EC50) was 0.60  ±  0.22  nM for U87
P11 and 0.61 ± 0.10 nM for U87 P15 in comparison with
1.42 ± 0.05 nM for control U87 P0 (Fig. 7F). Conversely,
we did not detect any difference of cytotoxicity after
TMZ treatment in the same experimental conditions
(EC50  =  500.3 ± 162.4 μM and 578.6 ± 152.1  μM for
U87 P0 and U87 P11 cells respectively) (Fig. 7G).
These data obtained in vitro supports the results from the
in vivo study, and demonstrate that EB1 overexpression
specifically sensitizes to Vinca-alkaloids anti-migratory
and cytotoxic effects in GBM cells.

To investigate in vivo the influence of EB1
overexpression on drug response, VCR, a MTA used in
the treatment of gliomas, and VFL, a new member of the
Vinca-alkaloid family were tested. Control U87 P0 or
EB1 overexpressing U87 P11 cells were transplanted by
stereotaxy to the striatum of nude mice and animals were
treated or not with VCR or VFL.
A significant survival benefit confirmed by mice
weight analysis was observed when EB1 overexpressing
U87 P11 bearing mice were treated with a Vinca-alkaloid,
whatever the drug (Figure 6). The higher survival gain
(13 days, p < 0.001) was obtained with VCR. Indeed,
median survival was 39 days and 26 days for U87 P11
bearing mice treated with VCR and vehicle, respectively
(Fig. 6D). Survival gain was only 5 days in control
U87 P0 bearing mice treated in the same conditions
(median survival of 46 and 41 days after VCR and
vehicle treatment, respectively) (Fig. 6B). Tumor volume
measurements confirm these data. VCR strongly reduced
tumor volumes in U87 P11 bearing mice (−90.5 ± 3.0%
vs vehicle, p < 0.005) as compared with U87 P0 bearing
mice (−62.2 ± 11.2% vs vehicle, p < 0.05) (Supplementary
Figure 4). Proliferation rate was significantly reduced in
U87 P11 cells but not in U87 P0 cells after VCR treatment,
as shown by Ki-67 staining (−46.2 ± 7.0% vs vehicle,
p < 0.005, at day 21) (Supplementary Figure 3).
A significant survival benefit (9 days, p < 0.005)
was also obtained with VFL. Indeed, median survival of
EB1 overexpressing U87 P11 bearing mice was 35 days
and 26 days, after VFL and vehicle treatment, respectively
(Fig. 6D). In contrast, survival of control U87 P0 bearing
mice was not improved after VFL treatment (median
survival of 45 and 41 days, after VFL and vehicle
treatment, respectively) (Fig. 6B).
In contrast to VCR and VFL, which display an
enhanced survival gain (+55 and 60% respectively) in
EB1 overexpressing U87 P11 bearing mice, temozolomide
(TMZ), the reference drug in GBM, induced a better
survival gain in low EB1expressing U87 P0 bearing mice
(48 days and 24 days, in U87 P0 and U87P11, respectively
(Supplementary Figure 5). Taken together, our results
show that EB1 expression, despite its bad prognostic
value level, may be considered as a predictive marker for
Vinca-alkaloid response in mice models.

Vinca-alkaloids antagonize the alteration of MT
dynamics induced by EB1 overexpression
In order to decipher the cellular mechanism of
Vinca-alkaloid sensitization, we analyzed the effects
of VCR on MT dynamic instability from EB3-GFP
comet data in control U87-MG cells and U87 EB1
overexpressing cells (Table 3). First, our results clearly
show that EB1 overexpression increased the MT growth
rate (+59.6%, p < 0.01), and strongly decreased the
distance-based catastrophe frequency (−41.3 %, p < 0.01).
Analysis of microtubule dynamics from CLIP-170-GFP
comet data confirmed the decrease in the distance-based
catastrophe frequency in U87 P15 versus U87 P0 cells
(−20%, p < 0,05). In U87 P0 cells, VCR did not alter the
growth rate and catastrophe frequency, excepted at the

factor of response to Vinca-alkaloid treatment. Moreover,
the prognostic impact on OS and PFS was shown to be
independent of other known prognostic factors including
age, functional status, and surgery. Further studies for
testing EB1 in addition to other biomarkers such as
MGMT status and IDH1 mutation are warranted in
patients with GBM and other high grade gliomas to
confirm EB1 prognostic role [18–22].
By modulating EB1 expression in U87-MG cells,
we have shown that EB1 promotes GBM cell proliferation
and migration, thus confirming the well-described role
of EB1 in the mechanism of cell migration [23–25] and
cell division [8, 9, 26, 27]. Furthermore, we show for
the first time that EB1 promotes GBM tumor growth in
nude mice. Analysis of the GBM-derived stem-like cells
GBM6 and GBM9 strengthen these observations. GBM6

higher concentration (1.6 nM). Indeed, this cytotoxic and
anti-migratory concentration slightly increased the MT
catastrophe frequency (+23.2%, p < 0.05, for 1.6 nM). In
contrast, in U87 P11, VCR strongly increased the distance
based-catastrophe frequency at all the concentrations
(+52.3%, p < 0.05 at 0.8 nM, + 64.4%, p <0.01 at
1.2 nM and +69.2%, p < 0.01, at 1.6 nM) and statistically
decreased the MT growth rate (−31.1 %, p < 0.05 at
1.2 nM and −27.9% , p < 0.05 at 1.6 nM). These results
suggest that VCR antagonize the alterations of MT
dynamics induced by EB1 overexpression. Samples videos
are presented in Supplemental movies 1 to 4.

prognostic marker in GBM patients and a predictive

showed an EB1-dependent and strong migratory potential,
and a higher tumorigenicity with a more infiltrative
pattern in vivo [17]. In addition, gene expression profiles
evidenced a distinctive gene expression signature
for GBM6 and GBM9, characterized by a specific
overexpression of genes involved in cell migration and
adhesion for GBM6. However, when this analysis was
performed, EB proteins were not selected for migration
signature. Based on their original brain location and their
distinctive molecular signature, GBM6 and GBM9 have
been classified as mesenchymal and proneural GBM
subtypes respectively [17]. Since EB1 overexpression
seems to be specific to GBM6, EB1 expression profile
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

should be included to the other known distinctive genes
characterizing mesenchymal GBM, and may help to define
new subtypes.
Interestingly, our study allows us to add EB1
among the proteins regulating the MT cytoskeleton that
are overexpressed in GBM such as spastin, class III
β-tubulin and γ-tubulin [28, 29]. Further work is needed
to decipher the interactions between these proteins. For
example, γ-tubulin complexes and EB1 have been shown
to produce apparent antagonistic effect on MT dynamics
and spindle positioning in HeLa Cells [30]. However, such
interaction may be interpreted only after a deep knowledge
of EB1 effect on MT dynamic instability, taking into

account several factors such as EB1 expression level and
post translational modifications like phosphorylation and
detyrosination [31–33].
Recent publications indicate that EB1 may play
a role in tumorigenesis suggesting that beyond its
prognostic value, EB1 could be considered as a potential
oncogene. EB1 induces cell proliferation through the
activation of beta-catenin/Tcell factor pathway [9, 21],
and the activation of aurora-B [34], a kinase essential
for mitosis in breast cancer for which EB1 negatively
impacts survival [8]. Interestingly, aurora-B expression
correlates with GBM aggressive behavior [27]. It has
also been shown that abnormal detyrosination of the
tubulin C-terminal EEY sequence promotes tumor cell
growth, which represents a significant marker of tumor
aggressiveness in breast cancer [35]. We recently found
that EB1, which shares the same C-terminal sequence as
tubulin [36, 37], undergoes a C-terminal detyrosination
process in GBM cells, which also may account for
enhanced tumor progression [6]. Furthermore, tubulin
detyrosination as well as EB1 detyrosination, are known
to impair accumulation of CAP-Gly proteins at growing
MT plus-end, thus altering MT dynamics and related cell
functions [37, 38].
Finally we demonstrated that EB1 overexpression
sensitizes GBM cells to Vinca-alkaloids by enhancing
anti-migratory and cytotoxic effects. However, EB1
overexpression in GBM cells did not improve the response
to TMZ. These results suggest that the mechanism of
sensitization by EB1 is MT-dependent. Indeed, we
demonstrated that Vinca-alkaloids alter so potently MT
dynamics in EB1 overexpression that they completely
reverse the phenotype due to EB1 overexpression. Our
results are consistent with a recent publication describing
in vitro a mechanism of cooperation between EBs
and MTA [7]. Indeed, in the presence of EB proteins,
MT growth rates were inhibited and MT catastrophes
were increased at concentrations of drugs that did not
affect MT dynamics in the absence of EB. The authors
suggested that catastrophes were MT age-dependent, and
that MT depolymerizing drugs accelerate aging in an EBdependent manner. Moreover, we previously reported
in U87-MG cells that anti-migratory effect of VFL was
associated with the inhibition of EB1 accumulation at MT
plus-end and with the decrease of C-ter detyrosinated form
of EB1 [6]. This shift in post-translational modification of
EB1 may participate to Vinca-alkaloid antitumor activity,
if one considers that detyrosinated EB1 promotes tumor
progression as described with detyrosinated tubulin [35].
It is also conceivable that increased cell proliferation may
sensitize the cells to the action of cell cycle-dependent
anticancer drugs.
Altogether, our data open new avenues of research
on the role of EB1 in GBM tumor progression that has
limited therapeutic options. Subgroups of glioma patients

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with EB1 overexpressing tumor should be identified.
Furthermore, MT targeting drug activity should be
evaluated in regard to EB1 status in cancer patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs
Vinflunine (Pierre Fabre France) and vincristine
(Sigma-Aldrich) were solubilized in sterile distilled water
or in a saline solution. Temozolomide was extracted from
5 mg Temodal® capsules in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Patients and tissue samples
We analyzed 109 patients with GBM referred
to our institution. Seventy-two of them were included
in tissue microarrays (TMA) that were constructed
from formalin-embedded tumor material. Brain tumor
samples were classified according to WHO CNS tumor
classification  [39] and their main clinical features are
reported in Table 1. Areas of viable and representative
tumor following review of all blocks were marked by two
pathologists prior to inclusion into the TMA (3 × 0.6 mm
cores for each tumor) [40, 41]. Consensual prognostic
factor such as age, functional status analyzed by
Karnovsky Performance Score (KPS), and surgery were
collected. Patients were routinely follow-up with brain
MRI every two months and assessment of progression
was performed according to MacDonald criteria’s [42].
TMA containing tissue from 33 patients with pilocytic
astrocytoma (WHO grade 1) and 40 patients with anaplasic
astrocytoma (WHO grade 3) were also analyzed. The
study was undertaken after informed consent from each
patient or their relatives, in accordance with institutional
board guidelines.
EB1 immunohistochemistry was carried out, using
an anti-EB1 primary antibody (clone 5, BD Biosciences)
[8, 9], and avidin–biotin–peroxidase method [43]. Isotype
control antibody (BD Biosciences) was used at the same
concentration as primary antibody. For confirmation,
a second anti-EB1 primary antibody was also used
(clone H-70, Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) [13]. EB2 and
EB3 immunohistochemistry was performed using an ­­
anti-EB2 primary antibody (Abcam, ab56753), and
an anti-EB3 primary antibody (Abcam, ab157217).
Positive cells were scored based on cytoplasm staining
of EB1. Only tumor cell staining was taken into account,
excluding hypertrophic endothelial cells in tumor blood
vessels. The number of positive immunostained cells out
of the total number of tumor cells (˃ 1,000) in 20 nonoverlapping high power fields (30,000 μm², objective
40X) per clinical sample was analyzed. EB1 expression
was classified semi-quantitatively according to the
visual scoring as 0 (undetectable staining in tumor cells),

1+ (<10% of tumor cell staining), 2+ (10%–50% of tumor
cell staining, or 3+ (>50% of tumor cell staining). Manual
cell counting of labeled tumor cells was performed by 2
pathologists independently, without knowledge of the patient
clinical status. The coefficient of variation of interobserver
reproductibility was 9.68% for EB1 expression scoring, with
no significant difference between the two observers (paired
t-test, p = 0.88).

J software. After cell lysis, 30 μg of total protein were
loaded into a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Anti-EB1 antibody,
anti-α-tubulin
and
anti-mouse
IgG-horseradish
peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch) were used.
Chemiluminescence detection kit (Millipore) was used for
visualization of protein bands. Chemiluminescent signal
was acquired on a G:BOX imaging system (Syngene,
Cambridge, UK) and quantification was done with Image
J software.

Cell culture and transfection

Analysis of cell proliferation

Human glioblastoma U87-MG cell line was ordered
from ATCC (number HTB14). Human glioblastoma
U118-MG, U251-MG, U138-MG and GL15 cells were
kindly provided by D. Figarella-Branger (Pathology
and Neuropathology Unit and Tumour Bank). U87-MG,
U251-MG, U118-MG, U138-MG and GL15 cells were
grown in EMEM media with glucose and L-glutamine
(Lonza, Levallois-Perret, France), containing 10%
fetal calf serum (Lonza), 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). GBM
stem-like cell lines GBM6 and GBM9 were isolated from
GBM patients and grown as previously described [16].
Normal human astrocytes were purchased from Lonza
and cultured in Astrocytes Basal Media supplemented with
astrocyte growth medium SingleQuots (Lonza). All cell
types were tested weekly for the presence of mycoplasma,
using MycoalertTM Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza).
ShRNA plasmid that specifically knocked out
human EB1 (NM_012325) and negative shRNA control
plasmid (Mission® non-target shRNA control vector) were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. EB1 expression plasmid
(16474) and negative control plasmid (16440) were
obtained from Addgene. U87-MG cells were transfected
with lipofectamineTM 2000 system (Invitrogen). For
establishing stable clones, the shRNA-transfected cells
and related control clones were selected in culture
medium containing puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) 24 hour
post-transfection. EB1-overexpressing clones and related
control clones were selected in 800 μg/ml G418. For EB1
silencing by transient transfection, cells were transfected
by lipofectamine 2000 system with siRNA for EB1
(Hs_MAPRE1-5, Qiagen) and all STAR control (Qiagen).
EB1 down-regulation was analyzed 48 hours or 72 hours
later by western blotting.

Cell
proliferation
was
assessed
using
5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemistry as
previously described [44]. After 4-hour incubation with
3 μg/mL BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich), cells were labelled with
monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) followed
by Alexa 568 nm anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes).
Nuclei were stained with 4′6-diaminido-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich). The stained cells were observed
under microscope, 20X magnification. Minimums of
200 cells were scored for BrdU incorporation. Cell growth
analysis was performed using the sulforhodamine B assay
as previously described [45]. For cytotoxicity assay, drugs
were added to the medium 24 h after cell seeding. At least
three independent experiments were performed for each
condition.

Transwell migration assay
Cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were seeded on the upper
side of transwell migration chamber (Becton Dickinson,
Le Pont de Claix, France) and allow migrating for 5 hours
as previously described [5]. Six fields per condition were
imaged and transmigrated cells were counted. Results
were expressed as percent of transmigrated cells compared
with no treatment condition. At least three independent
experiments were performed for each condition.

Animal studies
Intracerebral tumor transplantation
All experimental procedures and animal care were
carried out in conformity with the guidelines of the French
Government and approved by the Regional Committee
for Ethics on Animal Experiments. Six to 8 weeks old
female Swiss nude mice were obtained from Charles
River Laboratories France (L’Arbresle, France). After
animal anesthesia, 5 × 105 tumor cells were injected into
the striatum of the mice, as previously described [46].

Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis
Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as
previously described [5] by using the anti-EB1 antibody
and anti-mouse antibody Alexa 568 nm (Molecular
Probes); and FITC-coupled anti-α-tubulin antibody (clone
DM1A; Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were observed using
a Leica DM-IRBE microscope, 100X magnification.
All images were acquired using Metamoph software
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at identical
acquisition settings, and were processed using Image
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Experimental design
To evaluate consequences of the level of EB1
expression in GBM progression, 4 groups were constituted:
mice bearing U87 P0 (n = 17), U87 P11 (n = 17), U87
12783

Thermo Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark) precoated 1 hour
with fibronectin (10 μg/ml). U87-MG cells were then
transfected with plasmid coding for green fluorescent
protein EB3-GFP or CLIP 170 GFP using lipofectamineTM
2000 system (Invitrogen). Before microscopy analysis,
cells were incubated with various concentrations of VCR
for 4 hours.
Time-lapse acquisitions for microtubule dynamic
instability experiments were performed with a Leica
DM-IRBE equipped with a 100X objective lens. Sixty
images per cell were acquired at 2-s intervals using a
digital camera (CCD camera Coolsnap FX; Princeton
Instruments). EB3-GFP comets were detected using the
plusTipTracker package [49]. The software package
can be downloaded from http://lccb.hms.harvard.edu.
Comet detection requires no user intervention, as the
detection algorithm automatically estimates locally
optimal thresholds. Tracking and inference of complete
MT trajectories by plusTipTracker requires user-defined
settings of several control parameters (Watershed-based
detection: sigma 1 = 3; sigma 2 = 4 and K = 1; Tracking
search radius range = 5–10 pixels, minimum subtrack
length = 4 frames, maximum gap length = 12 frames,
max shrinkage factor = 1.5, maximun angle forward = 30°
and backward = 10°; fluctuation radius = 1.5 pixel ; Post
processing frame rate = 2s; pixel size = 130 nm). Correct
tracking was verified by visual inspection of several
overlay movies. The parameter settings were kept identical
for all movies. The plusTipTracker software package
contains modules for the parameterization of trajectories
characterizing MT dynamics within one movie and for the
comparison of the dynamics between movies. Many of
the metrics are redundant and thus cannot be considered
for comparative analyses without further dimensionality
reduction. To assess the consistency we chose 5 metrics
for pair-wise statistical testing: mean growth speed,
mean growth lifetime, mean growth length, time–based
catastrophe frequency and distance-based catastrophe
frequency. A t-test was performed for each of these
metrics. For each experimental condition, 5 to 8 cells were
analysed (400-1200 tracks per cell).

sh0 (n = 17) and U87 sh12 (n = 17). For analysis of
EB1-overexpression on antitumor effects of drugs, groups
of U87 P0 and U87 P11 bearing mice were constituted, and
received VCR (n = 14), VFL (n = 14), TMZ (n = 14) or
vehicle solutions (control groups) (n = 14).
Treatments
VFL (20 mg/kg/day) or VCR (0.8 mg/kg/day)
treatments were administered intravenously at days 4,
7, 11, 14, 18 and 21 after glioma implantation according
to the treatment schedule previously described [47] and
preliminary tolerance studies (not shown). VFL and VCR
were dissolved at 2.5 mg/ml and 0.16 mg/ml respectively in
0.9% NaCl. TMZ (5 mg/kg) was administered daily i.p. for
four consecutive days, at day 5 after tumor cell implantation.
TMZ was administered in a solution of 10% DMSO in
0.9% saline. Vehicle solutions were given to control groups.
Animal observation
Animals were monitored each day for weight loss,
ataxia, and periorbital hemorrhage [48]. For study of EB1overexpression consequences in glioma progression, three
animals per group were sacrificed at post tumor transplant
day 14, 21, and 28, and brains were removed and stored
at -80°C.
Tumor volume evaluation
Frozen brains were serially sectioned using a
Leica cryostat, and 20 μm sections were stained with
Hematoxylin/Eosin (HE) for histomorphology and
measures of the tumor volume. Images of HE-stained
sections were captured with a Leica Z16APO macroscope
using the Leica Application Suite 2.8.1 Software. The
tumor area was manually outlined and measured using
Image J software. Knowing the thickness and the number
of sections, we calculated the total volume of each tumor.
Tumor volumes were measured for three animals per group.
Assessment of tumor cell proliferation

Statistical analysis

Ki-67 immunostaining were performed on
sections  from paraffin embedded samples, with
monoclonal Anti-Ki-67 antibody (clone MIB-1; Dako)
and hematoxylin counter-staining. Three random
representative fields within tumor areas were used for
quantitation. Each Ki-67 positive cell was counted and
normalized to the total number of cells in each field.

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Cell counting,
cellular viability data, tumor volumes were analyzed
by Student’s t test. Overall survival (OS) was defined
to be the time from GBM diagnosis to death from any
cause, censored at the date of last contact. ProgressionFree Survival (PFS) was defined to be the time from
GBM diagnosis to progression or death, censored at
the date of last contact. PFS and OS were estimated by
the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used
to estimate survival distributions. Prognostic factors
with p < 0.15 in univariate analysis were explored in
multivariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards models
