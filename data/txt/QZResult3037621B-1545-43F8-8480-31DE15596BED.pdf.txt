Abstract
Women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are usually treated with platinum/
taxane therapy after cytoreductive surgery but there is considerable inter-individual
variation in response. To identify germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) that contribute to variations in individual responses to chemotherapy, we
carried out a multi-phase genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1,244 women
diagnosed with serous EOC who were treated with the same first-line chemotherapy,
carboplatin and paclitaxel. We identified two SNPs (rs7874043 and rs72700653) in
TTC39B (best P=7x10-5, HR=1.90, for rs7874043) associated with progression-free
survival (PFS). Functional analyses show that both SNPs lie in a putative regulatory
element (PRE) that physically interacts with the promoters of PSIP1, CCDC171 and
an alternative promoter of TTC39B. The C allele of rs7874043 is associated with poor
PFS and showed increased binding of the Sp1 transcription factor, which is critical
for chromatin interactions with PSIP1. Silencing of PSIP1 significantly impaired
DNA damage-induced Rad51 nuclear foci and reduced cell viability in ovarian cancer

lines. PSIP1 (PC4 and SFRS1 Interacting Protein 1) is known to protect cells from
stress-induced apoptosis, and high expression is associated with poor PFS in EOC
patients. We therefore suggest that the minor allele of rs7874043 confers poor PFS
by increasing PSIP1 expression.

INTRODUCTION

Consortium (OCAC).
We identified two rare SNPs that fall within
a regulatory element within intron 2 of TTC39B.
Chromatin conformation assays showed that the targets
of the regulatory element are PSIP1, CCDC171 and an
alternative promoter of TTC39B. DNA-protein analyses
indicated that the likely functional SNP is rs7874043,
which alters Sp1 transcription factor binding, a factor that
is critical for chromatin looping between the PRE and the
PSIP1 promoter. Furthermore, we show that silencing
of PSIP1 significantly impaired DNA damage-induced
homologous recombination function in ovarian cancer cell
lines. According to KM-plotter (an online database linking
expression to ovarian outcome in publicly available data),
high expression of PSIP1 is associated with poor PFS in
ovarian cancer suggesting that altered PSIP1 expression
may be driving the association between the associated
SNPs and outcome in EOC patients [22].

Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer
deaths among women worldwide with an estimated
225,500 new cases annually [1]. Although ovarian cancer
is among the most chemo-sensitive of solid tumors and
generally shows a good initial response to platinum/taxane
treatment and optimal debulking surgery, the disease will
recur in 60-80% of women with advanced disease within
five years [2, 3]. Considerable effort has been focused on
identifying predictors of outcome at the somatic level,
but less emphasis has been placed on the identification
of germline predictors of outcome. We and others have
used the candidate gene approach to identify ATPbinding cassette family members that might be associated
with PFS [4, 5]. However, these findings have not been
convincingly validated [5, 6].
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
been extremely successful at finding susceptibility loci
for many different complex diseases [7], including
multiple cancers [8]. The successful identification of
loci associated with response to treatment could have
profound clinical implications for individualizing anticancer treatment but there have been very few successful
GWAS identifying loci associated with outcome for any
cancer [9-16]. One factor that might explain this is that
for most cancers there is considerable heterogeneity in
the chemotherapeutic regimens used, which is likely to
contribute to heterogeneity in treatment response [17-19].
In addition, it has been difficult to compile germline DNA
and detailed treatment and clinical follow-up information
on a sufficiently large number of patients to provide
enough statistical power to detect loci associated with PFS
or overall survival (OS).
In this study, we aimed to identify germline
polymorphisms that influence response to first-line
chemotherapy in patients with EOC. Based on previous
ex vivo studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from
related family members that have shown moderately high
heritability (0.21 to 0.7, depending on dose) for sensitivity
to docetaxel [20] and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity [21],
we hypothesized that inter-patient variability in response
to these drugs may be in part be explained by genetic
variation that could be identified if we used a cohort of
patients who had been uniformly treated. Therefore, we
conducted the GWAS of PFS in ovarian cancer patients
treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel, with the initial
GWAS on 385 patients with high-grade, serous cancer
(HGSC) and follow-up phases on serous EOC patients
from ten studies from the Ovarian Cancer Association
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RESULTS
Four-phase GWAS
We carried out a four-phase genome-wide
association study of PFS in a total of 1,244 serous ovarian
cancer patients who had debulking surgery and were
uniformly treated with only carboplatin and paclitaxel as
first-line therapy (Figure 1).
In Phase 1, we conducted a genome-wide scan on
germline DNA from 385 patients from the Australian
Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS, n = 183), the Mayo Clinic
(MAYO, n = 68) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA,
n = 134) and performed a meta-analysis summarizing
results from these cohorts (refer to Methods for details of
genotyping and imputation). The Manhattan plot showing
SNP association with PFS is presented in Supplementary
Figure 1. We then prioritized 190 SNPs primarily ranked
by P-value in Phase 1 for validation and further replication
(Supplementary Table 1). We also included 10 SNPs in
the gene YAP1, in light of its association with response
to platinum-based chemotherapy in small-cell lung cancer
patients [14], to test whether this finding would replicate
in our study. These SNPs were also genotyped on Phase
1 AOCS and MAYO samples (DNA samples were not
available for TCGA) so that we could replace imputed
data with actual genotypes for these samples in subsequent
analyses.
In Phase 2, we genotyped these 200 SNPs in 706
6355

patients from 8 studies participating in OCAC. Following
further data cleaning, we updated treatment details and
other clinical information prior to Phase 2 analysis, which
revealed 106 patients included in the Phase 1 GWAS who
were no longer eligible for inclusion mainly due to the
fact that these patients received additional agents or did
not meet the dose requirement (Methods). Therefore, we
performed a pooled analysis of 985 patients from both
phases with these 106 patients excluded. This analysis
identified two uncommon SNPs in strong linkage
disequilibrium (LD), rs72700653 and rs7874043 (minor
allele frequency (MAF) ~ 1.85% and imputation r2 = 0.9)
in intron 2 of TTC39B, most strongly associated with
PFS in serous ovarian cancer patients (P = 3.5x10-7 and
3.6x10-7 for rs72700653 and rs7874043 respectively;
Supplementary Table 1). Both SNPs were imputed with
high quality (imputation quality score r2 = 0.81 in MACH
[23]). None of the 10 tag SNPs in the YAP1 gene were
associated with PFS in these 985 patients (P > 0.05,
Supplementary Table 1).
In Phase 3, we genotyped 38 tagSNPs, in addition
to rs72700653 and rs7874043, in 985 OCAC samples to
perform fine-mapping of the TTC39B locus. rs7874043
and rs72700653 remained the SNPs most associated
with PFS at this locus, and the variants in moderate LD
with rs7874043 showed consistent association with PFS
(Supplementary Table 2). In Phase 4, we sought further
replication of the association between these two variants
and PFS in two additional cohorts, MAC (n = 26) and the
clinical trial, ICON7 (n = 124) and additional samples
from OCAC (n = 109). As there were only a small number

of eligible cases in MAC, and both MAC and MAYO
studies were recruited at the Mayo Clinic, we combined
these two sets for analysis.
To get an overall estimate of the hazard ratio, we
pooled all available data from Phase 1, 2 (again excluding
the ineligible patients) and 4 (n = 1244). Details of
all the OCAC sites contributing to this study are given
in Supplementary Table 3. This analysis showed that
the minor allele of rs7874043 was associated with
significantly worse PFS (HR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.38 to
2.61, P = 7.3x10-5; Figure 2a). The median PFS in patients
homozygous for the common allele of rs7874043 was 16.0
months (95% CI = 15.0 to 17.1), compared to 11.5 months
(95% CI = 9.5 to 15.4) in heterozygous patients, without
adjustment for covariates (log-rank test P = 0.0098);
while the difference was 17.2 months (95% CI = 16 to
18.1) versus 11.5 months (95% CI = 9.6 to 14.7) when we
assumed all prognostic factors at their mean values (Figure
2b, Supplementary Figure 2). The result of association
between this SNP and PFS was similar when restricted to
the high-grade serous patients at advanced disease stage (n
= 1061, HR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.33 to 2.6, P = 2.6x10-4).
The median PFS was 14.8 months (95% CI = 14 to 15.8)
for these patients with homozygous genotypes versus 11.0
months (95% CI = 9.3 to 14.1) for heterozygote patients,
assuming mean covariates. The other SNP in high LD,
rs72700653, despite a similar HR, had weaker association
than rs7874043 due to more missing genotypes (HR =
1.91, 95% CI = 1.36 to 2.69, P = 2.2x10-4). We found
attenuated associations with PFS in OCAC patients who
were selected with no regard to chemotherapy (HR = 1.31,

95% CI = 1.04 to 1.66, P = 0.02; Supplementary Figure 3),
We also determined whether TTC39B SNPs were
associated with OS. rs7874043 showed a significant, but
weaker association with OS. The minor allele was also
associated with worse OS (HR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.09 to
2.23, P = 0.015). The median OS differences unadjusted
for covariates were 46.3 months (95% CI = 43.2 to 49.9)
for patients with homozygous genotypes versus 37 months
(95% CI = 29.8 to 53.8) for heterozygous patients (logrank test P = 0.048), and 48.7 months (95% CI = 45.4
to 55.3) versus 38.9 months (95% CI = 29.8 to 55.5)
assuming mean covariates (Supplementary Figure 4).

methylation (H3K3Me1) marks promoters and enhancers.
ENCODE ChIP-seq data for H3K4Me1 from eight
different cell lines covering the TTC39B locus revealed
that both rs7874043 and rs72700653 fall within a putative
regulatory element (PRE) marked by H3K4Me1 within
intron 2 of TTC39B (Figure 3a). Transcription factor
binding prediction indicated potential SNP-altered
binding of Sp1, FOXA1 and AP1 (Supplementary Figure
5; [24]). We performed electrophoretic mobility shift
assays (EMSAs) to assess binding of these transcription
factors to the common and minor alleles of each of these
variants and showed allele-specific protein binding
for rs7874043 (Figure 3b; lanes 1, 2 and 8, 9). EMSAs
using an Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide as competitor
suggested that a strong higher mobility band and a weaker
lower mobility band (in JAMs only) is likely to be Sp1
(Figure 3b, Supplementary Figure 6a). Using chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments we have shown that Sp1
is able to bind this site in JAM and A2780 ovarian cancer
cell lines in vivo (Figure 3c). We also observed protein
interaction at rs72700653, but found no difference in
binding between alleles (Supplementary Figure 6b).

To determine the likely target genes of the PRE,
we performed chromosome conformation capture (3C)
using an anchor primer within the restriction fragment
encompassing the PRE and a series of primers within
restriction fragments spanning all protein coding gene
promoters within two megabases of the PRE (Figure 4a).
The results showed that the PRE frequently interacts with
an alternative (1B) promoter of TTC39B in both A2780 and
JAM cells (Figure 4b). The PRE also frequently interacted
with the PSIP1 (also known as LEDGF) promoter, located
approximately 260kb away, in JAM but not A2780 cells,
and the CCDC171 promoter, approximately 300kb
away, in both JAM and A2780 cells (Figure 4c and 4d;
Supplementary Figure 7). All chromatin interactions
were confirmed by performing 3C with an independent
restriction enzyme using anchor primers in the relevant
gene promoters and a series of primers spanning the PRE

(Supplementary Figure 8). No significant interactions
were detected between the PRE and other flanking genes
including NFIB, ZDHHC21, CER1, FREM1 or SNAPC3
(Supplementary Figure 9).
Using luciferase reporter assays we demonstrated
that the PRE acts as a strong transcriptional enhancer
on the PSIP1 and CCDC171 promoters (Figure 5).
Interestingly, the PRE had no significant effect on the
TTC39B 1B promoter in A2780 cells and acted as a
silencer in JAM cells suggesting that, depending on the
cellular context, the PRE can act as an enhancer or silencer.
To examine the effect of the SNPs on the activity of the
PRE, we generated reporter constructs containing the
minor alleles of both rs7874043 and rs72700653 (Figure
5, TTC PRE HAP). In A2780 cells, inclusion of the PREminor alleles significantly increased TTC39B 1B promoter
activity and in JAM cells the minor alleles ablated the

PREs silencer activity. In both cell lines, inclusion of the
PRE-minor alleles had no additional effect on PSIP1 and
CCDC171 promoter activity. While this appears to rule
out a direct effect of these SNPs on transactivation of
these promoters, Sp1 is reported to regulate chromatin
looping and therefore the SNPs may be influencing the
physical interactions between the PRE and target genes
[25]. To address this question, we performed 3C analysis
on JAM cells after Sp1 siRNA-mediated silencing and
showed that the chromatin interaction between the PRE
and PSIP1 but not CCDC171 was ablated (Figure 5b and
5c; Supplementary Figure 10). Consistent with this, the
expression of PSIP1, but not CCDC171, decreased with
Sp1 knockdown (Figure 5d).

decile vs remaining patients); nor were expression levels
associated with rs7874043 genotype (P = 0.22), but there
were only six heterozygous carriers among the 142 tumors
analyzed (Supplementary Figure 11c). However, analysis
of 1171 epithelial ovarian tumors in KM-plotter [22], the
online tool for survival-associated biomarkers, showed a
strong association between high PSIP1 expression and
shorter PFS (Figure 6; HR = 1.44 (95% CI 1.23 - 1.68;
P = 6.6 x 10-6 for comparison above and below median
PSIP1 expression). Since there were no data available
in KM-plotter for CCDC171, we used the more limited
TCGA serous ovarian cancer dataset and found that among
the 68 patients with nil residual disease, high levels of
CCDC171 were associated with PFS (Supplementary
Figure 12; HR 5.04 (95% CI 1.99 - 12.79); P = 0.001
for the upper decile vs remaining patients). However, this
was not evident among 374 patients with any debulking
status (HR 1.25 (95% CI 0.84 - 1.86); P = 0.266 for the
upper decile vs remaining patients). In the TCGA dataset,
expression of PSIP1 was positively correlated with that
of CCDC171 and many other genes on the short arm of
chromosome 9 (Supplementary Table 4). This appears to
be largely because of co-amplification, as the correlations
dropped noticeably upon correction for copy number.

High expression of PSIP1 and CCDC171 is
associated with PFS
We used Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends
(RACE) to identify the transcript initiated from the 1B
promoter of TTC39B, as there was none described. We
identified a novel first exon of TTC39B, located ~13 kb
downstream of the canonical exon 1, with a successive
exon structure similar to the published TTC39B-202
(Supplementary Figure 11a). Negligible expression
of this novel transcript was found in 18 ovarian cancer
cell lines, whilst in 149 serous ovarian epithelial tumors
from the AOCS low or minimal expression was observed
(Supplementary Figure 11b and 11c). There was no
association between expression of this transcript and PFS
(HR = 0.7 (95% CI 0.38 - 1.25); P = 0.21 for the upper

a number of cancer cell lines [26]. Therefore, to assess
this function in ovarian cancer we silenced PSIP1 using
siRNA in two high grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines,
OVCAR3 and FUOV1 [27], which express relatively high
levels of PSIP1 (Supplementary Figure. 13a and 13b). We
observed a significant reduction in DNA damage-induced
Rad51 foci formation in both cell lines. Representative
images and quantification are shown for OVCAR3 using
two independent siRNA sequences (Figure 7a and 7b).
Furthermore, exposure of OVCAR3 and FUOV1 cells to
carboplatin and paclitaxel caused a moderate increase in
PSIP1 levels consistent with PSIP1 being responsive to
cellular stress, and in the case of carboplatin, potentially
responsive to DNA damage (Supplementary Figure
13c). In long-term cell viability assays we also found
that depletion of PSIP1 itself has significant effect on
cell viability (Figure 7c) of ovarian cancer cell lines
suggesting some level of dependency on PSIP1 levels for
cell survival.

patients with serous EOC. PFS in patients carrying the rare
allele of rs7874043 is ~5 months shorter than in patients
carrying the common allele. In particular for patients with
high-grade serous EOC at advanced stage who often have
poor survival, the SNP is also associated with ~4 months
difference in PFS. Despite the large differences in PFS,
these associations did not reach genome-wide significance
(P < 5x10-8). We estimate that to reach genome-wide
significance for the allele frequency of rs7874043,
we would need twice as many serous EOC patients,
depending on the true HR, with germline DNA samples
and detailed clinical follow up data. We found attenuated
associations with PFS in ovarian cancer patients who were
selected with no regard to chemotherapy, reflecting either
chance variation or that the effects of this SNP are specific
to the treatment response. Furthermore, we found these
SNPs had a significant, albeit weaker association with OS.
We have shown that the regulatory element,
in which rs7874043 and rs72700653 lies, acts as a
transcriptional enhancer on the PSIP1 and CCDC171
promoters, and that haplotype carrying the minor alleles
of these SNPs enhances expression of the non-canonical
TTC39B promoter. All three genes are located at 9p22.3,
a region of chromosomal gain previously identified by
comparative genomic hybridization in ovarian tumors as
being associated with resistance to paclitaxel/carboplatin

DISCUSSION
We have carried out the first GWAS of PFS in
European women diagnosed with EOC. We identified two
SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) in an intron of
the TTC39B gene that were associated with worse PFS in

ablated chromatin looping with the PSIP1 promoter and
reduced PSIP1 expression. We therefore suggest that the
minor allele of rs7874043 enhances chromatin looping
between the PRE and the PSIP1 promoter to increase
PSIP1 expression. Unfortunately, we were unable to
identify any heterozygous cell lines for rs7874043, and
therefore confirmation of these findings by evaluation of
additional allele-specific effects was not possible in this
study.
Although the absolute differences in PFS for
carriers of the rare TTC39B alleles, compared to the
common alleles, are quite large, the alleles are too rare
to be responsible for much of the observed variation in
PFS between affected women. Amongst the strengths
of our study is the inclusion of only cases who had
received standard first line treatment with carboplatin
and paclitaxel, and the focus on clinically measurable
PFS following first-line treatment, rather than on OS
following exposure to multiple different drugs. Although
we were able to obtain sufficient data in the populationbased OCAC sites to conduct this study, it is much easier
to do these studies in the context of clinical trials. Our
study therefore emphasizes the importance of collecting
germline DNA in clinical trials, and using them to detect
biomarkers of response.
In conclusion, through a GWAS we have identified
a SNP, rs7874043, as a very strong candidate for having
a direct causal effect on PFS in ovarian cancer patients
following first-line chemotherapy. We provide evidence
that this SNP falls within a distal regulatory element that
regulates several genes, including PSIP1, and show that
high expression of PSIP1 is associated with poor PFS
in ovarian cancer patients. We observed a significant
reduction in cell viability following PSIP1 inhibition,
suggesting that PSIP1 is a potential target for therapeutic
intervention in ovarian cancer as previously suggested
for other cancers [31]. Moreover, like other cancer cell
lines, transient silencing of PSIP1 in an ovarian cancer
cell line significantly impaired DNA damage-induced
RAD51 foci formation suggesting involvement of PSIP1
in the regulation of homologous recombination-mediated
DNA repair. PSIP1 is involved in HIV integration, and
so there is already some interest in developing specific
inhibitors. Successful inhibition of PSIP1 may provide a
novel approach to target ovarian cancer.

therapy [28]. The best characterized of the affected genes
is PSIP1 (PC4 And SFRS1 Interacting Protein 1), also
known as LEDGF (Lens Epithelial Derived Growth
Factor), which is a epigenetic reader recognizing H3K36
marks that preferentially associate with the internal coding
areas of actively transcribed genes [29, 30]. PSIP1 is
known to have oncogenic activity that controls a caspaseindependent lysosomal cell death pathway [31], and can
protect against cell death induced by many different
stimuli including etopside, anthracyclines, docetaxel
and oxidative stress [32]. PSIP1 is overexpressed in
chemoresistant acute myelogenic leukemia and protects
leukemic cells from apoptosis in vitro [33]. PSIP1 is
thought to protect cells from stress-induced apoptosis
by transcriptionally activating protective genes such
as HSP27 and CRYAB (alphaB-crystallin) [34]. More
recently, PSIP1/LEDGF has been shown to regulate
homologous recombination DNA repair pathway by
guiding the tethering of Retinoblastoma binding protein
8 (RBBP8; also known as CtBP-Interacting Protein)
to specific areas of chromatin (H3K36me3) in a DNA
damage-dependent manner, providing a mechanism for
its ability to protect cancer cells from DNA damage [35].
PSIP1 is also involved in HIV integration and is therefore
a promising candidate for anti-retroviral therapy [36, 37].
Almost nothing is known about the function of
CCDC171 (Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 171) except
that it has been identified as an NRF1 target gene based
on a Chip-Seq screen [38]. NRF1 plays a crucial role
in maintenance of mitochondrial function and oxidative
stress response. TTC39B (c9orf52) encodes a potential
transmembrane protein and two GWAS for lipid levels
have identified common SNPs in this locus associated
with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels
[39, 40]. This association was confirmed in a mouse model
which showed that knockdown of TTC39B resulted in
elevated levels of HDL-C [39]. These common SNPs are
not strongly correlated with the rare SNPs we found to be
associated with PFS (r2 < 0.1), and it is unknown whether
they regulate the expression of the same novel TTC39B
isoform that we identified. We cannot predict the function
of this novel isoform but we have shown that it is not
expressed at detectable levels in most ovarian cell lines,
nor in approximately one-third of serous ovarian tumors.
Our data implicate Sp1 as a potential mediator
of target gene(s) expression. Sp1 binds GC-rich DNA
elements and regulates target genes by recruiting and
complexing with transcription-associated proteins to
activate or repress gene expression [41]. Notably, Sp1 is
also able to mediate long-range activation of transcription
through chromatin looping [30], and the PSIP1 promoter
CpG island contains Sp1-responsive sites [42]. We showed
the minor C allele of rs7874043 preferentially binds Sp1
in vitro, and that Sp1 binds to a region encompassing
rs7874043, in vivo. Consistent with the known function of
Sp1 in chromatin looping, we showed that Sp1 silencing

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection criteria
All participating studies received approval from
the respective Institutional Ethics Boards. In order to
study a homogeneous group of patients in Phase 1,
we selected patients from AOCS, MAYO and TCGA
6362

Oncotarget

based on the following criteria: the primary cancer sites
described as ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal,
invasive serous histology, collection of primary treatment
response data completed at the time of patient selection,
high grade (grade 2 or 3), FIGO stage III or IV. Similar
patient selection criteria were applied to OCAC studies
in the following phases, except that the patients with low
grade and low stage were also included. To improve cost
efficiency, we preferentially genotyped AOCS patients
with extreme phenotypes in Phase 1 (Supplementary
Methods).
We observed substantial heterogeneity among
treatments that patients in OCAC received, with more
than 80 different chemotherapy drug combinations, dosage
levels and schedules used for first-line chemotherapy,
so we further selected patients who were treated with
only three weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line
therapy. Among these patients, the majority received >
4 cycles of paclitaxel at a dose of 135 to 175 mg/m2 and
carboplatin at AUC 5 to 7), while dosage for some patients
was unknown.
Prior to commencing data analysis in Phase 2, we
obtained updated clinical data, which revealed that 91
AOCS and MAYO patients included in Phase 1 no longer
met the criteria we applied because they had received
agents in addition to carboplatin/paclitaxel, or < 4 cycles
of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Other data updates on
residual disease and other clinical features meant that an
additional 15 cases were no longer eligible for the analysis.
We therefore excluded these cases from further analyses.
All the following analyses were based on the most up-todate clinical data. To summarize, we analyzed a total of
1244 cases who had received standard chemotherapy plus
an additional 1346 cases who had received non-standard
chemotherapy for the analyses selected with no regard to
chemotherapy. The details of their treatment is provided in
the Supplementary Table 5.

(PI_HAT > 0.2) was dropped. Patients who have been
recruited in both MAYO and TCGA were identified using
this approach and were included in the analyses only once.
Following the check of cryptic relationships, we assessed
potential population stratification using a Principal
Components Analysis (PCA) algorithm EIGENSTRAT
[44]. The HapMap 3 and GenomeEUTwin [45] individuals
were used as a reference panel in the calculation of the
principal components, and the current samples were
projected into the background of reference population. We
used 6 standard deviations (SDs) as the cut-off to identify
ancestral outliers, which were removed from further
association analysis. After these data cleaning, 183 AOCS
patients (766,728 SNPs) and combined 68 MAYO and 134
TCGA patients (525,792 SNPs) were included in Phase 1
analysis.
To improve array comparison, we inferred the
missing genotypes for the initial GWAS samples with the
reference of the CEU samples from the 1000 Genomes
pilot 1 data (June, 2010 release) using MACH 1.0 [23].
We had 385 samples on a common set of 297,906 SNPs
without strand ambiguity (i.e. A|T or C|G genotypes) for
imputation. We have imputed up to 6.86 million SNPs,
with 88.7% (~6 million) SNPs obtaining reasonable
imputation quality (imputed R2 > 0.3).
We used the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX
platform for genotyping in Phase 2-4, using previously
described methods and quality control measures [46]. ‘Tag
SNP Picker’ option at the HapMap web site was used to
pick 45 SNPs which captured 187 TTC39B variants (MAF
> 5%, in r2 > 0.5 with tag SNPs) from HapMap CEU
set. 40 SNPs among this tag-SNP list were successfully
genotyped and passed QC.

Progression-free survival and overall survival
PFS was defined as the time interval between the
date of histologic diagnosis and the first confirmed sign
of disease recurrence, or progression (Supplementary
Table 3). As a related survival trait, OS was defined as
the time interval from date of diagnosis to time of last
follow-up or time to death from any cause. To control for
ascertainment bias, prevalent cases (with an interval >
12 months between the date of histological diagnosis and
DNA collection) were excluded from analysis. There were
a small number of cases who died without any reported
evidence of progression (N = 17), and for them we applied
right censoring to PFS at the time of last assessment.

Genotyping and imputation
AOCS, MAYO and TCGA patients were genotyped
using Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad arrays, HumanHap
610 arrays and Human1M arrays, respectively. We applied
the following quality control steps for all three sets of
GWAS data separately: 1) removing samples with > 10%
missing genotypes; 2) excluding any SNP with less than
1% minor allele frequency (MAF); 3) excluding any SNP
that failed the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) test at
the significance level of 5e-6; 4) excluding the SNPs with
MAF > 5% when per SNP no-call rate > 5%, and those
with MAF < 5% when per SNP no-call rate > 1%. We
then assessed the cryptic relationship between the sample
pairs using the ‘—genome’ command in PLINK [43]. The
proportion of identical by descent (IBD) was estimated
from the cleaned whole genome data, and then either
of the paired IDs showing high levels of IBD sharing

Statistical analysis
The allelic association with PFS or OS was assessed
in a Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model, adjusting
for potential site differences and prognostic factors of
grade (low vs high), stage (4 levels), residual disease (nil

vs any) and age of diagnosis (specific to the analysis of
OS). We tested the proportional hazards assumption for
the adjusted variables and stratified by those that violated
the assumption. In most analyses, we found that study site
was the major variable violating the assumption; therefore,
we fitted sites as strata in the model. By fitting strata, we
assumed that there were baseline level differences in PFS
between the patients from different sites but no difference
in the hazard ratio conferred by the SNP being tested.
The data from Phase 1 MAYO and TCGA sets were
combined for analysis while stratifying for site differences,
because, unlike those from AOCS, they were not selected
for extreme phenotypes. To increase the statistical power
in Phase 1, we performed a meta-analysis of the results
from the AOCS and the combined MAYO and TCGA
set using an inverse-variance weighting approach. When
performing pooled analyses in Phase 2-4, we pooled data
from all studies while stratifying by study sites.

3C libraries were generated using HindIII, EcoRI
or BglII as described previously [49]. 3C interactions
were quantitated by real-time PCR (qPCR) using primers
designed within restriction fragments (Supplementary
Table 6). All qPCRs were performed on a RotorGene
6000 using MyTaq HS DNA polymerase with the addition
of 5 mM of Syto9, annealing temperature of 66oC and
extension of 30sec. 3C analyses were performed in three
independent experiments with each experiment quantified
in duplicate. BAC clones (RP11-746M21, RP11-940C5,
RP11-356J15, RP11-728G24) covering the 9p22 region
were used to create artificial libraries of ligation products
in order to normalize for PCR efficiency. Data were
normalized to the signal from the BAC clone library
and, between cell lines, by reference to a region within
GAPDH. All qPCR products were electrophoresed on 2%
agarose gels, gel purified and sequenced to verify the 3C
product.

Cell lines

Plasmid construction and luciferase assays

Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines A2780, JAM,
OVCAR3 and FUOV1 were grown either in RPMI
medium or DMEM/F12 with 10-20% FCS and antibiotics.
Cell lines were maintained under standard conditions,
routinely tested for Mycoplasma and identity profiled with
short tandem repeat markers.

The TTC39B, PSIP1 and CCDC171 promoterdriven luciferase reporter constructs were generated by
inserting PCR-generated promoter fragments into the
multiple cloning site (MCS) of pGL3-Basic. A 2.2 kb
fragment containing the PRE was inserted into the BamHI
and SalI sites downstream of luciferase. The minor
alleles of rs72700653 and rs7874043 were introduced
into promoter and PRE constructs by overlap extension
PCR. All constructs were sequenced to confirm variant
incorporation (AGRF, Australia). Primers used to
generate all constructs are listed in Supplementary Table
6. A2780 and JAM ovarian cancer cells were transfected
with equimolar amounts of luciferase reporter plasmids
and 50ng of pRLTK using Lipofectamine 2000. The
total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant per
experiment by adding carrier plasmid (pUC19). Luciferase
activity was measured 24 hours post-transfection using the
Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System on a Beckman-Coulter
DTX-880 plate reader. To correct for any differences in
transfection efficiency or cell lysate preparation, Firefly
luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase.
The activity of each test construct was calculated
relative to promoter constructs, the activity of which was
arbitrarily defined as 1.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)
EMSAs were carried out as previously described
[47], except that oligonucleotides were detected using
a Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module
kit (Cat no 89880, Thermo Scientific). Oligonucleotide
sequences used in the assays are listed in Supplementary
Table 6. Competitor oligonucleotides were used at 30-fold
molar excess.

In silico prediction of transcription factor binding
sites
Prediction of transcription factor binding sites was
performed using the AliBaba 2.1 program (http://www.
generegulation.com/pub/programs/alibaba2/index.html)
[24].

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) qPCR

siRNA silencing
Sp1 ChIP-qPCR (Sp1; D4C3 rabbit monoclonal,
Cell Signalling) assays were conducted as described
previously [48] with a sheared fragment size of 300 bp to
1 kb. For qPCR, 1 µl from 30 µl of DNA extract was used.
Primers are listed in Supplementary Table 6.
