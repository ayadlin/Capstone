ABSTRACT
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which accounts for 15–20% of all breast
cancers, does not express estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR)
and lacks human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression or
amplification. These tumors have a more aggressive phenotype and a poorer prognosis
due to the high propensity for metastatic progression and absence of specific targeted
treatments. Patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal or trastuzumab-based
targeted therapies because of the loss of target receptors. Although these patients
respond to chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes and anthracyclines better than
other subtypes of breast cancer, prognosis remains poor. A group of targeted therapies
under investigation showed favorable results in TNBC, especially in cancers with
BRCA mutation. The lipid-lowering statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme
A reductase inhibitors), including lovastatin and simvastatin, have been shown to
preferentially target TNBC compared with non-TNBC. These statins hold great promise
for the management of TNBC. Only with the understanding of the molecular basis for
the preference of statins for TNBC and more investigations in clinical trials can they
be reformulated into a clinically approved drug against TNBC.

INTRODUCTION

with the TNBC phenotype. Lastly and most importantly,
no effective specific targeted therapy is readily available
for TNBC. In recent years, significant advances have been
made in characterizing the molecular features of TNBC
and in preclinical and clinical studies of novel therapeutic
options for TNBC. In this review, we will focus on our
current understanding of the characteristics of TNBC and
the recent developments in the area of TNBC treatment.

Breast cancer is the most commonly encountered
form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancerrelated mortality among women in the world [1]. Every
year, an estimated 1 to 1.3 million breast cancer cases
are diagnosed worldwide. Of these, approximately 1520% belong to the triple-negative subtype [2]. TNBC is
defined by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor
(ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and the lack of
expression or amplification of human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBC is an important subject
of intense investigation for both basic researchers
and clinicians for several reasons [3]. First, there is a
clustering of TNBC cases in premenopausal women and
in women of African descent. Second, in spite of initial
good response to chemotherapy, the prognosis of TNBC
remains poor as compared to non-TNBC. Third, there is
a significant overlap of BRCA-associated breast cancers

BASAL-LIKE

BREAST

DNA microarray analysis has led to the
classification of breast cancer into the luminal A, luminal
B, HER2-positive, basal-like, and normal-like subtypes
[4]. Further refinement of the intrinsic subgroups has
identified the claudin-low group, which is characterized
by low-level expression of claudins 3, 4, and 7, occludin,

and E-cadherin [5]. The normal-like breast carcinomas
were later found to represent contamination of breast
cancer samples by normal breast cells [6]. Basal-like
breast cancers (BLBCs) were referred to as basal because
of their expression of genes typically expressed in basal
epithelial cells, such as cytokeratin 5, 6, or 17. BLBCs also
express genes normally associated with normal basal-like
myoepithelial cells of the breast ductal and lobular system,
such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also
known as HER1) [7].
In general, there is a significant overlap between
TNBC and BLBC and many investigators have used the
absence of hormone receptors as a characteristic feature
to define BLBC. Roughly, approximately 70-84% of
TNBCs are basal-like; conversely, about 70% of basallike tumors are TNBCs [8-11]. In spite of the similarities
between TNBC and BLBC; however, equating TNBC
with BLBC is not fully supported by other studies [1214]. TNBCs do not represent a homogeneous group when
analyzed by gene expression profiling, whereas the basallike subtype cancers do form a homogeneous group with
a similar gene expression profile [15]. This indicates that
the poor prognosis of TNBC may have resulted from
the high percentage of triple-negative tumors which are

actually basal-like. Therefore, the overall poor prognosis
of TNBC may be a result of this basal-like subgroup, and
triple negativity may be seen more as a symptom rather
than as a separate entity of breast cancer. It should be
noted that although TNBC and BLBC are not the same
entity, practically, TNBC takes the place of BLBC in the
application of clinical diagnosis and treatment because
immunohistochemical characterization is more feasible
compared to examination of the gene expression signature.
Although many molecules are involved in the
development of BLBCs, changes of the breast cancer
susceptibility gene BRCA-related pathway are the key
event leading to the formation of the BLBC phenotype
[4, 16]. If loss of hormone receptor expression in breast
cancer develops following the disruption of BRCA without
HER2 amplification, it might result in triple-negative
BLBC (TN-BLBC). However, if HER2 gene amplification
occurs by random mutation even in the presence of BRCA
disruption, the cancer will no longer be triple-negative;
instead, it will become non-triple-negative BLBC (NTNBLBC). Non-basal-like TNBC (NB-TNBC) arises as
a result of loss of expression of hormone receptors and
HER2 without the involvement of BRCA (Figure 1).

and triple-negative basal-like breast cancer (TN-BLBC) originate from basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) depending on whether HER2
amplification/mutation occurs in ER/PR-negative cancers following BRCA mutation. Non-basal-like triple-negative breast cancer (NBTNBC) may originate from non-basal-like breast cancer (Non-BLBC) without BRCA mutation. Adapted from de Ruijter TC et al: J Cancer

CHARACTERISTICS OF TNBC

Molecular characteristics of TNBC

Clinical characteristics of TNBC

Gene expression profiling of TNBC
The heterogeneity of TNBCs in terms of gene
expression profiling and responses to therapeutic regimens
is widely acknowledged. A study by Lehmann et al. has
revealed 6 distinct subtypes of TNBCs defined by their
gene expression profiles [26]. These subtypes identified
are basal-like 1 and 2 (BL1 and BL2), immunomodulatory
(IM), mesenchymal (M), mesenchymal stem-like (MSL),
and luminal androgen receptor (LAR). They differ
in important biological pathways and prognosis. For
example, BL1 and BL2 were highly proliferative and had
a higher expression of the genes related with cell-cycle
and DNA damage response. The M and MSL groups
were enriched for genes of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) pathway, whereas the IM subtype was
characterized by immune cell signaling features. The LAR
subtype was ER-negative but AR-positive and the LAR
cell lines were sensitive to the AR antagonist bicalutamide
[26]. This sub-classification of TNBC is useful not only in
the understanding of the disease properties but also in the
identification of the molecular targets for treatment.

TNBC is more frequent in younger patients, in
BRCA1 mutation carriers, and in specific ethnic groups
(African American and Hispanic women). TNBC accounts
for 39% of breast cancers in African-American women
under the age of 50, but only 16% in Caucasian women of
the same age group [17, 18]. Histologically, approximately
80-90% of TNBC tumors are invasive ductal carcinomas,
with the rest classified as apocrine, lobular, adenoid cystic,
medullary, and metaplastic [19, 20]. Besides, TNBCs have
increased lymphocytic infiltration, and are high grade
with large tumor size. TNBCs are associated with a 4-fold
increase in the risk of distant metastases [21]. In contrast
to the non-TNBCs which most frequently metastasize to
the bone, TNBCs more frequently metastasize to the lungs
and the central nervous system [22, 23]. It is estimated
that approximately 15-30% of TNBC patients will develop
brain metastases [2]. This aggressive metastatic behavior
contributes to the overall shortened survival of patients
with TNBC compared with non-TNBC. The prognosis of
patients with TNBC is very poor, because these tumors
are clinically more aggressive than other breast carcinoma
subtypes and targeted therapy is ruled out in these patients
[3, 24, 25].

Gene mutations in TNBC
Basal-like TNBCs are associated with mutation of
the BRCA gene because the majority of BRCA germline mutation carriers develop BLBC [19]. The tumor
suppressors TP53 and PTEN are more frequently lost

or mutated in triple-negative BLBC than in non-TNBC
[11, 27]. Other genes that tend to be frequently mutated
in triple-negative BLBC compared to other breast tumors
include the tumor suppressor gene Rb and the K-Ras
oncogene [28]. It is believed that the combined loss of
activity of TP53, Rb, and BRCA pathways is responsible
for the high level of genomic instability observed in basallike tumors [29].
The most frequently somatically mutated genes in
TNBC include TP53, Rb, and PTEN among others [30].
Somatic mutations of TP53 are found in the majority of
TNBCs (53.8-85.7%), and when combined with inferred
pathway analysis there is evidence for loss of TP53
function in nearly all basal-like tumors. Interestingly,
TP53 mutations in basal-like tumors were more of the
nonsense and frame-shift type, in contrast to mutations
in luminal tumors that more frequently were missense.
Integrative pathway analysis comparing basal-like and
luminal breast cancer identified hyperactivated FOXM1
as a transcriptional driver of proliferation and increased
activity of MYC and HIF1-α/ARNT as a key regulator of
this process [27].

patients, for example patients with lymph node-positive
disease [31].

Cytotoxic chemotherapy
Currently, taxane- and anthracycline-based
combination chemotherapy remains the standard treatment
approach for early-stage TNBC patients, and this approach
has changed little during the last decade. To date, there are
no specific guidelines for chemotherapeutic management
of TNBC. The European Society for Medical Oncology
(ESMO) states that cytotoxic chemotherapy is the standard
of care for the treatment of TNBC and that the choice of
the regimen should be made after consideration of diseaserelated factors (previous therapies and response, tumor
burden, and need for rapid disease/symptom control) and
patient-related factors (patient preferences, biological age,
menopausal status, comorbidities and performance status,
and socioeconomic and psychological factors).
Microtubule stabilizers
Microtubule stabilizers (such as taxanes) are a
group of potent tubulin polymerizers that are available
for the treatment of breast cancer. Many studies have
demonstrated that taxanes (paclitaxel [Taxol], docetaxel
[Taxotere], cabazitaxel) are more effective for TNBCs
than receptor-positive cancers [32, 33]. A study by Martin
et al. showed maximum benefit in TNBC patients when
4 cycles of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide
(FEC) were followed by weekly paclitaxel for 8 weeks
compared to just 6 cycles of FEC [32]. Shortening the
administration interval from once every 3 weeks to once
every 1-2 weeks substantially improved efficacy [33].
Ixabepilone (BMS-247550), another microtubule
stabilizer, is actively used in patients with taxanerefractory and locally advanced breast cancer as well
as TNBC patients. The clinical activity and toxicity
of ixabepilone are similar to those of the taxanes, with

THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS
Generally speaking, patients with TNBC are
treated similarly as women who present with non-TNBC,
especially in terms of adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings.
Surgery and radiotherapy are employed routinely in a
similar way as with other types of breast cancer [3].
Patients with TNBC do not benefit from therapies that
are designed to target the hormone receptors (such as
tamoxifen) or HER2 (such as Herceptin). Currently,
chemotherapy, individually or in combination with surgery
and/or radiotherapy, is the standard treatment mode for
TNBC. TNBCs can be chemo-sensitive particularly to
cytotoxic agents, such as anthracyclines and taxanes,
which are part of the standard therapy used for high-risk

neuropathy and myelosuppression as dose-limiting
toxicities [34, 35]. Ixabepilone has been shown to bypass
the resistance mechanisms associated with taxanes and
anthracyclines and provides a treatment option to avoid
platinum tolerance (discussed later). In patients with
taxane- and/or anthracycline-resistant metastatic TNBC, a
combination of ixabepilone and capecitabine (a prodrug of
5-fluorouracil) has an improved progression-free survival
(PFS) compared to capecitabine alone (4.1 vs. 2.1 mo)
[35]. The ixabepilone and capecitabine combination can be
used in patients who do not tolerate cisplatin combinations
or when renal functions are compromised.

disease-free survival (DFS) was similar in both groups. On
the contrary, Carey et al. [37] showed that TNBC patients
had a much higher clinical response to doxorubicin and
cyclophosphamide than non-TNBC patients. Although the
role of anthracyclines alone in TNBC is questionable, a
definite benefit was observed when anthracyclines were
used in combination with taxanes in node-positive TNBC
patients [39].
Platinum agents
The intense interest in the role of platinum
compounds including carboplatin and cisplatin in TNBC
is based on phenotypic and molecular similarities between
BRCA-associated breast cancer and the basal-like subtype.
The platinums act by generating intra- and inter-strand
double-stranded DNA crosslinks, preventing the formation
of the replication fork and producing double-strand
breaks and replication lesions. Due to BRCA mutation,
which leads to the dysfunction of the DNA repair cascade,
platinums produce cell death in BRCA-mutant breast
cancer cells [40]. In a retrospective study, Staudacher et
al. [41] reported that median overall survival (OS) and
median PFS were improved in patients responding to
platinum-based chemotherapy: 27 vs. 8 mo and 10 vs.

Anthracyclines
Anthracyclines (doxorubicin and epirubicin)
are among the most active drugs for breast cancer
treatment. Many studies have shown that TNBC is
sensitive to anthracycline-containing regimens [36, 37].
It is noteworthy that the benefit of anthracycline-based
regimens in patients with TNBC remains controversial
[38]. In a retrospective analysis, Liedtke et al. reported
a pathological complete remission (pCR) rate of 22%
in TNBCs compared to 11% in non-TNBCs with an
epirubicin-containing regimen [36]. However, the 3-year

Microtubule stabilizers polymerize tubulin in the microtubule, thereby inhibiting cell division. Anthracyclines inhibit RNA synthesis by
intercalating between base pairs of the DNA/RNA strand, thus preventing the replication of rapidly growing cancer cells. Platinums generate
intra- and inter-strand double-stranded DNA crosslinks, preventing the formation of the replication fork and inhibiting cell division. PARP
inhibitors prevent the repair of single-strand breaks that occur during cell cycle especially in BRCA-mutated cells. Angiogenesis inhibitors
block the growth of new blood vessels by inhibiting VEGF. EGFR inhibitors bind to EGFR and turn off the uncontrolled growth of cancer
cells with EGFR mutations. TK inhibitors block tumor growth through inhibiting intracellular tyrosine kinase activity. mTOR inhibitors
suppress cancer cell growth and proliferation through targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Statins inhibit the conversion
of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. The anti-cancer effects of statins may involve the inhibition of
multiple signaling pathways important for the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HMG-CoA,

[52-54]. This observation has prompted a series of
clinical trials incorporating anti-EGFR agents, such as
cetuximab and lapatinib. Cetuximab binds specifically
to the extracellular domain of EGFR, thus inhibiting its
activation [55]. Clinical data point to a modest effect of
EGFR-targeted therapies in at least a subset of TNBCs
[56]. Several phase II studies of anti-EGFR therapy in
combination with cytotoxic agents or with other targeted
therapies are currently ongoing in metastatic TNBC [57,
58].

4 mo, respectively. Another retrospective investigation
of a large cohort of metastatic TNBC by Zhang et al.
revealed that platinum use as first-line chemotherapy
resulted in longer PFS compared with patients without
platinum therapy (7.8 vs. 4.9 mo), although no statistical
difference of OS was observed. In the different platinum
drugs administered, cisplatin-based regimens gave the
best performance [42]. It should be noted, however,
that platinums should be used in combination with
other chemotherapeutic agents to increase response and
survival rates. For example, when platinums are used in
combination with epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil, a very
high complete clinical response was achieved [43].

TK inhibitors
Tyrosine kinases (TKs), including the Src and Abl
family and c-Kit, are overexpressed in breast cancer
and associated with the progression of metastatic breast
cancer. Many small-molecule agents, such as imatinib,
erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, dasatinib, and pazopanib,
are used for treating a variety of solid tumors through
targeting the phosphorylation of the receptor by acting
at TKs. Dasatinib (previously known as BMS-354825)
is an oral inhibitor of multiple TKs. Dasatinib has been
shown to inhibit the growth of TNBC cell lines in vitro
when used alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic
agents such as cisplatin [59]. Currently, several studies are
being carried out to evaluate dasatinib as monotherapy or
in combination with chemotherapy in treating TNBC [60,
61]. Pazopanib, an anti-angiogenic TK inhibitor, which
was approved in 2009 for the treatment of advanced
renal cell carcinoma, has been evaluated alone or in
combination with the microtubule stabilizer capecitabine
in breast cancer patients [62, 63]. In a model of a mouse
orthotopic implanted breast tumor model, Di Desidero
et al. showed that the combination of pazopanib and
topotecan significantly enhanced the anti-tumor activity
of either drug alone and prolonged survival, with a
marked decrease in tumor vascularity, proliferative index,
and apoptosis induction [64]. However, whether this
combination has selectivity on TNBC over non-TNBC is
not known.

Targeted therapies
PARP inhibitors
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays a
vital role in the repair of single-stranded DNA breaks
through the base excision repair pathway [44]. As
mentioned above, TNBC has a high frequency of
mutation of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA.
Therefore, PARP inhibitors can lead to cell death in
BRCA-mutated TNBCs because of the inability of the
cell to repair DNA damage due to BRCA mutation. It has
been demonstrated that PARP inhibition potentiates the
effects of ionizing radiation agents, DNA-methylating
compounds, topoisomerase inhibitors, and platinums [40].
Several PARP inhibitors such as olaparib (AZD 2811) and
BSI-201 are at different stages of clinical development
[45]. Encouraging [46, 47] as well as discouraging [48]
results have been reported for PARP inhibitors. Several
mechanisms of PARP inhibition resistance in BRCAassociated tumors have been proposed. These include
reversal of truncating mutations and stabilization of
mutated BRCA proteins [49]. Several strategies to
overcome these resistance mechanisms are currently under
investigation.

mTOR inhibitors

Angiogenesis inhibitors

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a
key component of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, which
has recently been considered to play a critical role in
tumor escape from hormone dependence in breast cancer
[65]. The expression of Acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4),
an enzyme participating in arachidonic acid metabolism,
drives the hyperactivation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR
pathway in in vitro transfection experiments in breast
cancer cells [66]. ACSL4 has been shown to be associated
with the aggressive phenotype of breast cancer [67, 68].
Orlando et al. smartly showed that inhibition of ACSL4
through siRNA or rosiglitazone, a small-molecule antidiabetic drug, could reverse the ER-negative phenotype
in the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore, through
combination of rosiglitazone and tamoxifen, an ER
inhibitor, could synergistically inhibit the growth of

Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) is much higher in TNBC compared with nonTNBC [50]. Bevacizumab (Avastin), an anti-VEGF
monoclonal antibody, has consistently exhibited improved
PFS and response rate when used in combination with
first-line chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer. A
meta-analysis of patients with HER2-negative metastatic
breast cancer (n = 2447) demonstrated that bevacizumab
improved efficacy, including 1-year OS rate, both overall
and in subgroups of poor-prognosis patients [51].
EGFR inhibitors
Overexpression of EGFR has been observed in
more than half of TNBCs and is correlated with a poor
prognosis and decreased response to chemotherapy

MDA-MB-231 cells both in vitro and in the nude mouse
xenograft model [66].

(fluvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) could significantly
inhibit the proliferation of TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells
with an IC50 in the range of 1-2 μM. However, the IC50
was much higher in the HER2-positive SKBr3 cells (2649 μM) and the ER-positive MCF-7 cells (85-138 μM)
[79]. Goard et al. characterized fluvastatin sensitivity
in 19 breast cancer cell lines and found that fluvastatin
sensitivity was strongly associated with an ERα-negative
status and the basal-like phenotype [83]. Xenografts
of ERα-negative tumor cells have also been shown to
respond to treatment with lipophilic statins, including
simvastatin and fluvastatin [79, 81].
We extended this observation to TNBC vs.
non-TNBC cell lines and confirmed that lovastatin, a
natural and lipophilic statin derived from Monascus
ruber-fermented rice or from Oyster mushroom [84],
preferentially inhibited cell proliferation and migration of
TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells (Table 1) . A
nude mouse xenograft model also showed that lovastatin,
at its clinically relevant concentration (2 or 10 mg/
kg body weight), inhibited the in vivo tumor growth of
triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). The
molecular mechanisms underlying lovastatin’s effect on
MDA-MB-231 cells included modulation of the proteins
involved in apoptosis, differentiation, cell proliferation,
signal transduction, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and tumor metastasis (ref. [85] and Figure 3).
Therefore, statins have the potential to prevent
or treat a subset of breast cancers, such as TNBC. The
lipophilicity of statins also affects their role in breast
cancer. Only lipophilic statins are able to permeate
the cell membrane and affect cellular functions. This
has been demonstrated in the study by Mueck et al. in
which showed that all lipophilic statins, i.e., lovastatin,
atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and simvastatin, but not a
hydrophilic statin, i.e., pravastatin, significantly inhibited
the cell proliferation of breast cancer cell lines [80].

Statins
Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, reduce the
intracellular biosynthesis of cholesterol by reversibly
inhibiting the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate
(Figure 2). These lipid-lowering drugs are commonly
used to treat hypercholesterolemia, thereby reducing the
mortality from cardiovascular disease. Recently, statins
have also pleiotropic anti-cancer effects in a variety of
cancers including breast cancer [69]. Preclinical studies
have shown anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-invasive,
and radio- and chemo-sensitizing properties of statins.
Given that statins are FDA-approved, well tolerated, and
affordable, they provide the opportunities for accelerated
repurposing as cancer therapeutics.
Consensus regarding the clinical effects of statins
on breast cancer has not been reached, which has resulted
in inconsistency in the relationship between statin use
and the incidence of breast cancer. Many studies have
demonstrated a decrease in the risk of a variety of cancers,
including breast cancer, among statin users [70-74].
Conversely, several studies revealed that long-term use of
statins did not significantly affect the risk of breast cancer
[75-77]. However, through a systematic review and metaanalysis, Wu et al. found that although statin use may not
influence the risk of breast cancer, it is associated with a
decrease in mortality of breast cancer patients [78].
Preclinically, statin sensitivity has been found to be
associated with NF-κB activation [79], lack of expression
of ERα [79, 80], mutation of TP53 [81], and the status
of PTEN-PI3K pathway [82]. Campbell et al. studied
the effect of statins on the growth of breast cancer cells
in vitro. Of the four statins tested, only lipophilic statins

In spite of the general susceptibility to standard
chemotherapy, TNBCs exhibit an overall poorer
survival compared to non-TNBCs. The benefits of
targeted therapies have eluded patients with TNBC due
to the absence of well-defined molecular targets. Novel
therapeutic targets that are being actively explored and
new agents with therapeutic potential that are under
development are summarized in Figure 4. Two important
areas need in-depth investigations that may bring about
significant changes in the management of TNBC.
First, the identification of molecular targets will
be crucial to identifying actionable targets in patients
with TNBC. Within the TNBC subtypes, there are some
potentially targetable pathways such as the BRCAmediated pathway, the Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, Hedgehog,
and JAK2 pathways, which could be exploited for future
therapeutic strategies. Unfortunately, many years of study
have failed to identify a single pathway that is targetable
in TNBC. A major obstacle to this area is the inter- and
intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Better understanding of
the molecular basis of the heterogeneity of TNBC and
development of more robust therapeutic strategies are
desired.
Secondly, agents that selectively or preferentially
target TNBC are urgently needed. In this regard, the
lipid-lowering statins have shown great promise. The
confusing results obtained from clinical use of statins in
breast cancer prevention may have resulted from lack of
distinction between TNBC and non-TNBC. Preclinical
data from several independent groups have shown that
lipophilic statins exhibit preference for ER-negative or
basal-like breast cancer. All lines of evidence obtained up
to now clearly point to an obvious preference of statins for
TNBCs. Future studies about the use of statins in TNBC
should focus on: 1) exploring the role of statins in breast
cancer stem cells; 2) optimizing the formulation of statins,
for example using novel nanoparticles to encapsulate the
statins; and 3) identifying the molecular mechanisms
underlying statins’ preference for TNBC and the possible
drug targets of statins in TNBC. With the understanding of
the molecular basis for the preference of statins for TNBC
and more investigations in clinical trials, statins may find
their avenue to becoming clinically useful drugs against
TNBC.
