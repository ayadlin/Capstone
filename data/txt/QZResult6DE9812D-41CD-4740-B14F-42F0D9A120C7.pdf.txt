BACKGROUND. Antiandrogen withdrawal is a potential therapeutic maneuver for
patients with progressive prostate cancer. This study was designed to examine
antiandrogen withdrawal effects within the context of a large multi-institutional
prospective trial.
METHODS. Eligibility criteria included progressive prostate adenocarcinoma despite
combined androgen blockade. Eligible patients received prior initial treatment with
an antiandrogen plus orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
(LHRH) agonist. Patients were stratified according to type of antiandrogen, type of
progression (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] or radiographic), presence or absence of
metastatic disease, and prior LHRH agonist versus surgical castration.
RESULTS. A total of 210 eligible and evaluable patients had a median follow-up of
5.0 years; 64% of patients previously received flutamide, 32% bicalutamide, and
3% nilutamide. Of the 210 patients, 21% of patients had confirmed PSA decreases
of 50% (95% CI, 16% to 27%). No radiographic responses were recorded.
Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3 months (95% CI, 2 months to 4
months); however, 19% had 12-month or greater progression-free intervals. Median overall survival (OS) after antiandrogen withdrawal was 22 months (20 and
40 months for those with and without radiographic evidence of metastatic disease, respectively). Multivariate analyses indicated that longer duration of antiandrogen use, lower PSA at baseline, and PSA-only progression at study entry were
associated with both longer PFS and OS. Longer antiandrogen use was the only
significant predictor of PSA response.
CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate a relatively modest rate of PSA response in
patients who were undergoing antiandrogen withdrawal; however, PFS can be
relatively prolonged (1 year) in approximately 19% of patients. Cancer

therapy withdrawals in breast cancer patients 2 decades ago.1 Additional observations in breast cancer
patients who were withdrawing from antiestrogenic
therapy underscored the potential of steroid-receptor
antagonists as well as steroid-receptor agonists to
elicit withdrawal responses in certain patients.1,2
Withdrawal responses in prostate cancer patients
were initially documented after treatment with flutamide (a nonsteroidal antiandrogen).3,4 Several case
series of flutamide withdrawal responses, some occurring in those who were receiving a combination with
other agents, were subsequently described from single-institution cohorts.5–10 Withdrawal responses in
prostate cancer patients have been described in
patients treated with other antiandrogens, including
bicalutamide,11–13 nilutamide,14,15 and chlormadinone.16 Although improvements in cancer-related
anemia, pain palliation, and radiographic regression
of measurable disease have been documented, PSA
declines have been most commonly detected. In addition to antiandrogens, withdrawal responses in prostate cancer patients have been documented after their
cessation of megestrol acetate,17,18 diethylstilbestrol,19
13-cis-retinoic acid,20 and estramustine.21 In general,
withdrawal responses occur several weeks after drug
withdrawal; however, bicalutamide, which has a relatively long serum half-life, may not have evident withdrawal responses until 6 to 8 weeks after ceasing
administration of this medication.13 All of these
agents are known to interact with intracellular ligandregulated receptors that modulate gene transcription.
With the exception of 2 trials,13,22 the antiandrogen withdrawal studies published to date have used
single-institution experiences. We designed a prospective multi-institutional clinical trial that used the
cooperative group mechanism, which examines antiandrogen withdrawal effects in patients with progressive prostate cancer. Although initial inclusion
criteria allowed only patients pretreated with flutamide with radiographic evidence of metastatic disease, the protocol was subsequently amended to
include patients who were withdrawing from other
nonsteroidal antiandrogens (bicalutamide and nilutamide) as well as patients without radiographic evidence of metastases at the time of initial disease
progression. The results reported herein represent
the largest single prospective trial reported with antiandrogen withdrawal.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patient enrollment took place from March 15, 1995
to June 1, 2001. Patients were required to sign

informed consent forms and to have histologically
proven prostate adenocarcinoma and progressive disease at the time of study entry. Eligible patients must
have either 1) been previously enrolled in SWOG
889422 and randomized to the flutamide arm, 2) have
received continuous antiandrogen therapy as part of
their initial hormonal therapy for radiographic
demonstrated metastatic (stage D2) prostate cancer,
or 3) have received continuous antiandrogen therapy
as part of their initial hormonal therapy but not have
been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer.
Patients entering this study after failing SWOG protocol 8894 had to have progressed by the radiographic
criteria set forth in that protocol.23 SWOG 8894 was a
protocol that examined orchidectomy plus or minus
flutamide administration as initial treatment for
patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Criteria for
PSA progression before enrollment on this protocol
included a confirmed 50% increase in PSA compared
with the PSA nadir after initial androgen deprivation.
PSA progression required a minimal increase of 4
ng/mL. Patients must have had prior treatment with
either surgical orchiectomy or an luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog and be
receiving an antiandrogen (bicalutamide, flutamide,
or nilutamide) on a regular basis at the time that
they were enrolled into the protocol. No other concomitant therapy was allowed (except LHRH analogs)
during the therapeutic period of antiandrogen withdrawal. Within 30 days of registration, patients could
not be receiving therapy other than androgen deprivation and an antiandrogen. All patients had a PSA
level 4 ng/mL at study entry.
Requested baselines studies included a medical
history and physical examination; tests included PSA
level, complete blood count (CBC), alkaline phosphatase level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, and a
bone scan. A computed tomography (CT) scan at
baseline was required only when ‘‘clinically indicated.’’ Follow-up studies defined by the protocol
included PSAs every 2 weeks during the initial 12
weeks postantiandrogen withdrawal. The remaining
laboratory and clinical studies were scheduled on a
monthly basis. Initial positive imaging studies were
to be re-evaluated at 3-month intervals. LHRH analogs were continued postwithdrawal of antiandrogens.

Response and Progression Criteria
Responses and progression were monitored by bone
scans and CT scans as previously described.23 PSA
response was defined as a 50% decline in PSA from
baseline, with a confirmed decrease 4 or more weeks
later. We note that the protocol was written before

Antiandrogen Withdrawal/Sartor et al.

consensus criteria were developed.24 Criteria for PSA
progression included a 50% increase in PSA compared with either baseline PSA or the PSA nadir postantiandrogen withdrawal (whichever value was
lower). The increased PSA was confirmed before
removing the patient from study for progressive disease; however, the date of the first >50% increase
was noted as the date of progression. PSA progression required an increase of 4 ng/mL.

Statistical Analysis
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with confirmed PSA declines of 50%. Univariate and
multivariate proportional hazard models were used
to assess factors associated with both progressionfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The
methods of Kaplan-Meier were used to estimate PFS
curves. PFS was defined as time from registration to
the date of progression or death, whichever came
first. OS was defined as time from registration to
death from any cause. Patients without an event
documented were censored at their last contact date.

RESULTS

SWOG indicates Southwest Oncology Group; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; SD, standard deviation
from the mean; D2, stage D2; LHRH, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone.

The study closed to new accrual after 259 patients
had registered. Eight patients were deemed ineligible
for various reasons, ie, 4 did not have prestudy laboratory tests within the specified time frame, 1 had
incomplete initial forms, 2 had no histologically proven diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma, and 1 had
therapy for renal cell carcinoma before antiandrogen
withdrawal. An additional 41 patients were not eligible as a consequence of not starting an antiandrogen
at the time of initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (a clear condition of eligibility for the protocol).
Consequently, a total of 210 eligible patients were
both evaluable and analyzed. Median follow-up was
5.0 years. Demographics and baseline characteristics
of these patients are shown in Table 1. The average
baseline PSA was 128 ng/mL, and the average duration of prior antiandrogen use was 25 months. The
majority (58%) of patients had PSA-only progression

before entry on the trial; 17% of patients were enrolled after completing SWOG 8894 (which required
radiographic progression). Flutamide was withdrawn
in 64% of cases, bicalutamide in 32% of cases, and
nilutamide in 3%. Bone-scan positive metastases
were present in 75% of patients; no radiographic evidence of metastases was noted in 22% of cases.
A total of 9 patients were not assessable for
response because of lack of adequate data after antiandrogen withdrawal. These patients were assumed
to be nonresponders in subsequent analyses. Of 210
patients, there were 44 (21%; 95% CI, 16–27%) confirmed (4 weeks later) PSA responses. All but 2 of
these patients had a response duration that exceeded
8 weeks. PSA responses were noted in 24% (95% CI,
17–33%) of patients pretreated with flutamide, 13%

Descriptive Factors
Patients were prospectively described according to
several variables (at the time of trial entry) including
the following: 1) PSA-only progression: yes versus no;
2) patient type: SWOG 8894 versus prior stage D2
diagnosis versus no prior D2 diagnosis; 3) method of
castration: orchiectomy versus LHRH agonist; and 4)
type of antiandrogen: flutamide versus bicalutamide
versus nilutamide.

(95% CI, 6–24%) of patients pretreated with bicalutamide, and 25% (95% CI, 4–71%) of patients pretreated with nilutamide. No radiographic responses
were noted after antiandrogen withdrawal.
Factors associated with confirmed PSA response
rates were examined first in a univariate analysis (see
Table 2). Race, method of androgen deprivation (surgical vs medical), Gleason score, and PSA-only progression were not statistically significant predictors
of PSA responses. Patients with confirmed stage D2
disease (radiographically detected metastases) were
less likely to have a PSA response. Patients with a
baseline serum PSA in the lowest quartile (10 ng/
mL) were more likely to have a PSA response post-

withdrawal compared with those in the highest quartile (83.1 ng/mL). Longer duration of antiandrogen
therapy (>32 months before withdrawal) was associated with a higher probability of PSA response. In
the multivariate analysis evaluating all factors, as
noted in Table 2, only duration of prior antiandrogen
exposure was a significant predictor of PSA response
postwithdrawal.
Of the 210 eligible and evaluable patients, 203
showed progression of disease; thus, these data are
mature. Overall median PFS was 3 months (Fig. 1A).
Of note, several patients had a significantly
prolonged time to progression with 19% of patients
having no evidence of progression 1 year after antiandrogen withdrawal. Occasionally, patients had no
evidence of progression even 2 or more years after
antiandrogen withdrawal, thus indicating that duration of response is surprisingly durable in a subset of
patients. Stratifying patients into those with and
without radiographic evidence of metastatic disease
provided median progression-free survival estimates
of 2 and 7 months, respectively (Fig. 1B).
As shown in Figure 2A, median OS after antiandrogen withdrawal was 22 months (95% CI, 19
months to 28 months). Stratification of patients into

able metastatic disease revealed median survivals of
20 and 40 months, respectively (Fig. 2B). The mean
baseline PSA at study entry for all patients was 128
ng/mL (median, 20.8). For patients without radiographically demonstrable metastatic disease, PSA
mean  SD was 24  42, and the median was 10.7
ng/mL. For patients with radiographically demonstrable disease, the mean PSA  SD was 160  434,
and the median was 28.4 ng/mL.
As shown in Table 3A, African-American race,
Gleason score, type of antiandrogen, age, or method
of androgen deprivation therapy (medical vs surgical)
had no bearing on PFS in the univariate analysis.
Univariate factors associated with longer time to progression after antiandrogen withdrawal included
lower PSA value, longer duration of prior antiandrogen treatment, and no radiographic evidence of metastases. In the multivariate analysis (Table 3B),
evaluating all factors in Table 3A, longer durations of
antiandrogen use, lower baseline PSA values, and
PSA-only progression before trial entry were predictive of longer PFS.
OS was examined as shown in Table 4. In univariate analyses (Table 4A), PSA-only progression, lower
PSAs at time of protocol entry, no radiographic
evidence of metastases, and longer preprotocol antiandrogen therapy duration were associated with

prolonged OS, whereas type of antiandrogen, age,
type of androgen suppression (orchiectomy vs
LHRH), and Gleason score were not. In the multivariate analysis (Table 4B), longer duration of antiandrogen use, PSA-only progression, and lower PSAs at
protocol entry were associated with significantly
longer overall survival.

DISCUSSION
Taken together, these data from a large multi-institutional prospective trial indicate that the confirmed
PSA response rate after antiandrogen withdrawal is
21% when taken in aggregate. This study, although
larger than previously published studies, has PSA
response rates (considering confidence intervals)
similar to those previously published.6–8,13,22 No radiographic responses were observed, although the vast
majority of men had bone-only metastatic disease
assessed by bone scans. It is well known that
improvement in bone scans is rare in this setting.
There are several limitations to this study.
Although study entry criteria required regular use of
antiandrogens before study entry and specified that
antiandrogens should be used as part of the initial
androgen deprivation treatments, no methods to
directly assess compliance with these measures were
incorporated into the study. Given that antiandrogens have traditionally been an ‘‘out of pocket’’
cost,25 compliance assessment is a potentially important issue; withdrawal responses would only be
anticipated in patients who were regularly taking the
prescribed antiandrogen. We also note that there is
no control group in this study. This trial is simply a
phase II trial, and potential deleterious effects of
continuing antiandrogens were not examined. Thus,
we cannot determine whether antiandrogen withdrawal altered survival. Furthermore, no quality-of-life
measurements were obtained.
It is important to recognize that only data
derived from patients who initiated antiandrogen
therapy at the same time as androgen deprivation
therapy (LHRH or orchiectomy) were analyzed
for this study. In clinical practice, many patients
currently receive antiandrogens as a secondary
hormonal manipulation (after disease progression
postandrogen-deprivation therapies). One cannot
extrapolate these findings to distinct patient populations. In this protocol, treatments subsequently
administered after antiandrogen withdrawal were not
assessed; these treatments could have influenced the
overall survival of patients.
Variations in the response rate to flutamide, nilutamide, and bicalutamide withdrawal occurred in this

Antiandrogen Withdrawal/Sartor et al.

study; however, the type of antiandrogen was excluded
as a candidate predictor for the multivariate model
because it was confounded with stage D2 status and
type of progression. Consequently, a direct analysis of
the type of prior antiandrogen on response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival was statistically invalid. There were only 7 patients in the
nilutamide group, so stable estimates for that group
could not be ascertained. Little data on nilutamide
withdrawal exist in the literature.12,13 Two of the nilutamide patients had >50% PSA declines, and each of
these patients had a relatively prolonged period without progression (14 months and 22 months).
Duration of antiandrogen pretreatment was
linked in this study to time to disease progression
and overall survival after antiandrogen withdrawal in
the multivariate analysis. We hypothesized that at
least 2 issues played a role in this process. Duration
of initial antiandrogen therapy, as defined in this
study, is a surrogate for duration of response to initial endocrine therapy; thus, a longer PFS may be
anticipated simply on the basis of disease kinetics,
ie, patients with longer PFS intervals after initial hormonal therapy also had longer PFS intervals after
antiandrogen withdrawal. Alternatively, longer antiandrogen usage may be associated with particular
molecular changes that help to govern disease progression. For instance, studies of flutamide pretreated patients have indicated that flutamide usage
can be associated with androgen receptor mutations
in metastatic prostate cancer cells.26
Baseline PSA and PSA-only progression were
linked in this study to both PFS and OS. Those individuals with lower PSAs and those individuals with
PSA-only progression before antiandrogen withdrawal had a better prognosis compared with those with
higher PSAs or radiographic progression at time of
trial entry. We note that this study did not measure
variables reported by others to have prognostic importance in castrate-refractory prostate cancer (such
as hemoglobin, LDH, and alkaline phosphatase).27,28
Regardless, these data provide excellent estimates of
overall survival in a broad population of patients in
the United States with castrate-refractory disease.
Radiographic responses have been previously
recorded after antiandrogen withdrawal6 but were
not documented in this trial. These data indicate
that clinical trials that are measuring radiographic
responses may enroll patients postantiandrogen
withdrawal without significant concern that these
types of responses will be routinely attributed to
antiandrogen withdrawal.
Antiandrogen withdrawal should be the first
therapeutic maneuver to take place in a patient

2399

whose disease is progressing after combined androgen blockade. Although confirmed PSA declines of
>50% are seen in a minority of cases, the time to
progression for patients after antiandrogen withdrawal may be prolonged in selected patients. Caution
in follow-up is warranted when following patients
with PSA alone under these circumstances, as evidence of objective progression without PSA increases
has been documented.29
Taken together, these data are both mature and
include multivariate analyses of important endpoints
such as time to PFS and OS. Our studies indicate
that duration of prior antiandrogen therapy, PSAonly progression, and lower PSA levels at the time of
antiandrogen withdrawal are significantly associated
with both longer PFS and OS in patients with castrate-refractory prostate cancer.
