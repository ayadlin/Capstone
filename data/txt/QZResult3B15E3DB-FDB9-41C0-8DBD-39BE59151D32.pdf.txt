Abstract
The relevance of cysteine metabolism in cancer has gained considerable interest in recent years, largely
focusing on its role in generating the antioxidant glutathione. Through metabolomic proﬁling using a
combination of high-throughput liquid and gas chromatography–based mass spectrometry on a total of
69 patient-derived glioma specimens, this report documents the discovery of a parallel pathway involving
cysteine catabolism that results in the accumulation of cysteine sulﬁnic acid (CSA) in glioblastoma. These
studies identiﬁed CSA to rank as one of the top metabolites differentiating glioblastoma from low-grade
glioma. There was strong intratumoral concordance of CSA levels with expression of its biosynthetic
enzyme cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1). Studies designed to determine the biologic consequence of this
metabolic pathway identiﬁed its capacity to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in glioblastoma cells, which
was determined by decreased cellular respiration, decreased ATP production, and increased mitochondrial
membrane potential following pathway activation. CSA-induced attenuation of oxidative phosphorylation
was attributed to inhibition of the regulatory enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. Studies performed in vivo
abrogating the CDO1/CSA axis using a lentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNA approach resulted in
signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition in a glioblastoma mouse model, supporting the potential for this
metabolic pathway to serve as a therapeutic target. Collectively, we identiﬁed a novel, targetable metabolic
pathway involving cysteine catabolism contributing to the growth of aggressive high-grade gliomas. These
ﬁndings serve as a framework for future investigations designed to more comprehensively determine the
clinical application of this metabolic pathway and its contributory role in tumorigenesis. Cancer Res; 74(3);

Introduction
Gliomas represent a common type of primary brain tumor
that arises from glial cells in the brain, which includes astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells. The World
Health Organization classiﬁes glioma into grades 1 to 4 based
on speciﬁc pathologic criteria, which play a central role in
prognosis and clinical management. For example, patients
with grade 1 gliomas are typically cured following surgical
resection, whereas patients diagnosed with grade 4 gliomas,
also termed glioblastoma, have a median survival of approxAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Radiation Oncology; 2Chemical Biology and Molecular Medicine; 3Advanced Microscopy Laboratory; 4Cancer Imaging and

imately 1 year despite aggressive multimodality therapy (1, 2).
Considerable progress has been made in understanding the
underlying biology of gliomas. For example, common molecular alterations identiﬁed in low-grade oligodendrogliomas
and astrocytomas are allelic loss of 1p and 19q and mutations
in p53, respectively, whereas grade 3 and 4 astrocytomas
typically are driven by alterations in phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K), EGFR, VEGF, and PTEN signaling (2). More recently,
mutations in the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1
(IDH1) have been identiﬁed in low-grade glioma and secondary
glioblastoma, which were then discovered to form the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) that demonstrated the
capacity to regulate global epigenetic programs in these
tumors (3–5).
Despite these advancements in understanding glioma
biology, the underlying metabolic alterations that drive the
aggressive phenotype of glioblastoma remain unclear. Nearly
a century ago, Warburg and colleagues made the seminal
observation of aerobic glycolysis in cancer (6, 7), yet a
deﬁnitive explanation for why tumor cells metabolize glucose through this seemingly inefﬁcient process and the
selective advantage offered remains unclear. However, its
clear relevance is evident with the widespread application
of 18-FDG–PET (2[18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose–positron

emission tomography) imaging, which can also predict
histologic grade in glioma with relatively high accuracy (8).
A comprehensive study of glioma metabolism was recently performed using global metabolomic proﬁling on patientderived tumors. These investigations identiﬁed unique metabolic subtypes in glioma, with the metabolic signature of
glioblastoma being consistent with anabolic metabolism (9).
Through this line of investigation, we identiﬁed the metabolic intermediate of cystine catabolism cysteine sulﬁnic
acid (CSA) as a novel metabolite associated with glioblastoma, demonstrating a more than 23-fold increase in accumulation when compared with grade 2 glioma. Cysteine is a
semiessential amino acid that plays an important role in the
metabolic cross-talk between neurons and astrocytes. It is
subsequently metabolized, resulting in the synthesis of
either taurine or glutathione, which have established roles
as essential intermediates for brain function (10, 11).
Although the accumulation of taurine has been demonstrated in astroglial cells, this metabolite does not seem to be
relevant in glioma (10, 12). Rather, our current understanding of cysteine metabolism in relation to tumor biology has
primarily focused on its role in glutathione (GSH) synthesis.
Speciﬁcally, cysteine serves as the rate-limiting intermediary
in the formation of GSH, which is one of the most abundant
antioxidants in the central nervous system (13, 14). GSH
synthesis through cystine uptake has been previously
described to play an important role in glioma cell survival
during redox stress and hypoxia and modulating this metabolic pathway has demonstrated therapeutic potential (13).
Although the generation of the antioxidant GSH from cysteine, and its contributory role in modulating redox status,
has been studied in detail, this alternate catabolic pathway
leading to the accumulation of CSA has yet to be identiﬁed in
tumors. In this report, we present for the ﬁrst time the
identiﬁcation and potential relevance this metabolic pathway may play in glioblastoma biology.

Materials and Methods
Tumor samples and patient characteristics
Tumor specimens used in these studies are as described
previously (9). Brieﬂy, all surgeries were performed at the H.
Lee Mofﬁtt Cancer Center and Research Institute (Tampa, FL)
and tissue was obtained from the Mofﬁtt Cancer Center Tissue
Core Facility. All of the grade 3 and 4 tumors used in this
analysis were newly diagnosed malignancies. Tumors were
fresh-frozen and their integrity and histology conﬁrmed by a
staff pathologist before aliquoting samples. Institutional
Review Board/Human Subjects approval was obtained for this
retrospective study (MCC16197).
Global metabolomics and targeted metabolite
quantitation
Metabolomic studies were conducted at Metabolon Inc.
using methods previously described (9). Brieﬂy, metabolic
proﬁling analysis combined three independent platforms:
ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (UHPLC/MS-MS) optimized for basic species,
UHPLC/MS-MS optimized for acidic species, and gas chroma-

tography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Metabolites were identiﬁed by automated comparison of the ion features in the
experimental samples to a reference library of chemical standard entries that included retention time, molecular weight
(m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as
associated MS spectra, and were curated by visual inspection
for quality control using software developed at Metabolon (15).
Statistical analysis of log-transformed data was performed
using "R" (16) and Welch t tests were performed to compare
data between experimental groups. Multiple comparisons
were accounted for by estimating the false discovery rate using
q values (17).
Absolute quantitation of CSA was analyzed by isotope
dilution UHPLC/MS-MS. Calibration and internal standard
solutions were prepared in water. Tissue (30  10 mg) was
spiked with 50 mL internal standard solution (10 mg/mL CSAD4, prepared according to Santhosh-Kumar and colleagues
(18), 70 mL of water and 300 mL of acetonitrile and simultaneously homogenized/extracted in the presence of beads in a
Geno-Grinder 2010. Following centrifugation, 5 mL of the
supernatant was analyzed on a Waters Acquity/Thermo Quantum Ultra LC/MS-MS equipped with a Ascentis Express HPLC
HILIC, 2.7 mm, 2.1  50 mm column (Supelco) using a 0.5%
formic acid in water/acetonitrile gradient. Mass spectrometer
conditions were selective reaction monitoring, negative ionization mode, and HESI source, and monitored transitions were
CSA, m/z 152  88; CSA-D4, m/z 156  92. Quantitation was
performed using a weighted linear least squares regression
analysis generated from 10 calibration standards (0.01 to 10
mg/mL).
Cysteine dioxygenase 1 expression
Cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1) expression was evaluated by
Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Western blot assays were performed using antibodies against CDO1
(Abcam; ab53436). Blots were quantiﬁed using ImageJ (NIH,
Bethesda, MD), and the CDO1 expression of individual samples
was normalized to loading control (b-actin). Immunohistochemical staining was used to determine CDO1 expression on
a glioma tissue microarray purchased from US Biomax (GL
103a). The slides were stained using the Ventana Discovery XT
automated system (Ventana Medical Systems) following the
manufacturer's protocol and counter stained with hematoxylin.
Slides were scanned using the Aperio ScanScope XT and Image
analysis to quantify CDO1 expression was performed using a
Aperio Nuclear v9.1 algorithm as previously described (19).
Cell culture
Human glioblastoma cell lines U251, T98G, and U87 were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and
grown in RPMI-1640 (U251; GIBCO) or Eagle Minimum Essential Medium (U87 and T98G; ATCC) supplemented with 10%
inactivated FBS. The glioblastoma neural stem cell line G179
was provided by Dr. Austin Smith (University of Cambridge,
Cambridge, United Kingdom), distributed by BioRep (20), and
grown in conditions as previously described (19). Cell line
authentication was not carried out by authors within the last
6 months.

Cysteine Catabolism in Glioblastoma

Establishment of stable CDO1 knockdown cells
U251 cell clones using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral
particles (sc-91642-v; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The shRNA–
control group was transfected by control shRNA lentiviral
particles (LP-Neg-LV 105-0200; Genecopoeia Inc.). Cells were
seeded in 12-well plates, grown to 80% conﬂuency, and infected
with shRNA more than 48 hours in the presence of polybrene (5
mg/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable colonies were selected and isolated in
the presence of puromycin (2 mg/mL; Sigma).
Oxygen consumption rate
Real-time oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured
using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer (XF24; Seahorse
Bioscience). Cells were seeded in their respective media overnight. One hour before the experiment, cells were washed and
media replaced with Seahorse assay media. Indicated compounds or vehicle controls were injected directly to the wells at
the stated concentrations through pneumatic injection ports.
For sulfasalazine experiments, cells were pretreated (200
mmol/L) 6 hours before each experiment. Readings were
normalized to total protein and data analyzed using Seahorse
software, with the unpaired t test being applied to test the
signiﬁcance of change.
Mitochondrial isolation
Approximately 150  106 cells were used to isolate mitochondria. Cells were gently scraped in ice-cold PBS and spun at
600  g at 4 C for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded
and the cells were resuspended in 3 mL of ice-cold isolation
buffer (10 mL of 0.1 mol/L Tris–MOPS, 1 mL of EGTA/Tris, 20
mL of 1 mol/L sucrose in 69 mL of distilled water, pH 7.4). Cells
were then homogenized using a precooled Teﬂon pestle in a
glass potter. The homogenate was then spun at 600  g at 4 C
for 10 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to a glass
centrifuge tube and spun at 7,000  g at 4 C for 10 minutes. The
supernatant was discarded and the mitochondrial pellet was
resuspended in ice-cold isolation buffer. The mitochondrial
concentration was measured by the Biuret method and the
concentration was adjusted approximately to 50 mg/mL.
Mitochondrial membrane potential
The JC-1 Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical Company) was used
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Micrographs of
images were taken with a Leica TCS SP5 AOBS laser scanning
confocal microscope through a 63X/1.4NA Plan Apochromat
oil immersion objective lens (Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH).
Of note, 405 Diode, Argon 488, and HeNe 543 laser lines were
applied to excite the samples and tunable emissions were used
to minimize cross-talk between ﬂuorochromes. Images for
each sample were captured with photomultiplier detectors
and prepared with the LAS AF software version 2.6 (Leica
Microsystems).
Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity
A pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme activity microplate assay kit (Abcam; ab109902) was used. Cells were grown
to 80% conﬂuency in 100-mm dish. After treatments the cells

www.aacrjournals.org

were placed into ice-cold PBS, and the manufacturer's protocol
was followed.
ATP quantiﬁcation
The ATP determination Kit (Invitrogen) was used. Cells were
grown to 80% conﬂuency in 100-mm dish. After the respective
treatments, cells were placed into ice-cold PBS and the manufacturer's protocol was followed.
Apoptosis
A caspase-3 apoptosis kit (BD Biosciences) was used and the
manufacturer's protocol was followed and analyzed by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
Redox stress
An H2-DCFDA (dihdyrodichloroﬂuorescein, diacetate) kit
from Invitrogen was used and analyzed by FACS according to
the manufacturer's protocol.
Animal handling
All in vivo experiments were performed according to the
institutional guidelines and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (4031R). Xenograft tumors
were established in athymic nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories) using methods previously described (19). For intracranial tumors, mice were anesthetized, indicated cell suspensions (106 cells in 10 mL) were injected using a stereotactic
device, and sacriﬁced when neurologic symptoms became
apparent. Kaplan–Meier curves were used and a log-rank
value was calculated to analyze survival.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done using a Student t test unless
otherwise indicated.

Results
Tumor grade–speciﬁc changes of CSA levels and CDO1
expression in glioma
Global metabolomic proﬁling was performed using a combination of UHPLC/MS-MS and GC/MS on a total of 69 freshfrozen glioma specimens surgically resected (18 grade 2, 18
grade 3, and 33 grade 4) using a metabolomic library consisting
of more than 2,000 puriﬁed standards. Following log transformation and imputation with minimum observed values for
each compound, Welch two-sample t tests were used to
identify biochemicals that differed signiﬁcantly between histologic grades. These studies identiﬁed metabolites associated
with cysteine metabolism as a signiﬁcant metabolic pathway–
differentiating grade 2 and grade 4 glioma (Fig. 1A). Cystine
uptake in glioma cells is primarily attributed to the membrane
transporter system xc, which mediates the exchange of extracellular cystine with intracellular glutamate (21). Cystine is
then rapidly reduced intracellularly to cysteine, in which it
forms GSH when combined with glutamate and glycine, or is
further metabolized to taurine through the metabolic
intermediaries CSA and hypotaurine. Both GSH and hypotaurine demonstrated signiﬁcant differences between glioma
grade, which were 3.2- (P ¼ 0.01) and 6.63-fold (P < 0.001)

higher in glioblastoma, respectively. However, these studies
identiﬁed a more than 23-fold increase in CSA levels in
glioblastoma when compared with grade 2 glioma (P <
0.001), which ranked as the metabolite with the highest relative
accumulation in glioblastoma when compared with grade 2
glioma (Fig. 1A and B). Supplementary Table S1 provides a list
of the top 10 metabolites with highest fold increases and
decreases in glioblastoma when compared with grade 2 glioma.
We went on to both validate and quantify CSA levels in
glioblastoma using targeted UHPLC/MS-MS in a panel of
tumors originally proﬁled that demonstrated a range of CSA
levels, from modest (2 fold) to high (10 fold) increases in
CSA accumulation. Quantiﬁcation in samples demonstrating
1.95- to 10.32-fold increases in CSA levels corresponded to CSA
concentrations ranging from 2.35 to 25.8 ng/mg in tissue with a
relatively high intrasample concordance (Supplementary Fig.
S1; r2 ¼ 0.84).
As cysteine catabolism along this metabolic pathway has
not been previously studied in the context of tumor biology,
as an initial investigation, we tested the hypothesis that
CDO1, which metabolizes CSA from cysteine, would be

aberrantly expressed in high-grade glioma. Of the initial
69 tumors proﬁled, 34 had tissue available for further
analysis. When normalized to b-actin, Western blot analysis
performed on tissue lysates demonstrated a signiﬁcant
increase in CDO1 expression in grade 4 glioma (Fig. 1C;

with CSA levels 1 (representing the median value) demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase in CDO1 expression (Fig.

levels and CDO1 expression and further supports cysteine

glioblastoma. CDO1 expression was then determined in an
independent dataset using immunohistochemical staining
on a glioma tumor microarray. Automated image analysis
software was used to determine the number of positive cells
in each specimen. Grade 4 glioma demonstrated a trend in
higher positivity when compared with grade 2 and 3 (P ¼
0.06). Although intragrade heterogeneity of CDO1 expression
was identiﬁed in glioblastoma, with a quartile of tumors
demonstrating low CDO1 expression, high expression of
CDO1 (>40%) was observed exclusively in grade 4 tumors,

a pattern that was present in a quartile of tumors (Fig. 1E).
Representative pictographs illustrating 0% to 75% staining of
CDO1 are provided in Fig. 1F.
CSA modulates mitochondrial function
As the role of CSA in gliomagenesis has not yet been
explored, our initial studies focused on general cellular metabolism using the Seahorse XF Extracellular Flux Analyzer.
Exogenous exposure of CSA consistently resulted in decreased
cellular oxygen consumption in varying treatment conditions

in the glioblastoma neural stem cell line G179 (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S3A; ref. 20). This observation was particularly notable in treatment conditions consisting of pyruvate
addition to promote aerobic respiration. Similar ﬁndings were
observed when we extended our studies to established glioblastoma cell lines U251 and T98G (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
On the basis of the initial observation of CSA attenuating
cellular respiration, we sought to determine whether pretreating cells with CSA could modulate pyruvate-induced oxygen
consumption. As demonstrated in Fig. 2B, CSA exposed to cells

in glucose- and pyruvate-deﬁcient conditions decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption by 36%  1%. As expected, the
addition of pyruvate increased oxygen consumption (54% 
3%); however, this increase was attenuated in cells exposed to
CSA, only demonstrating a 25%  3% increase in oxygen
consumption (P < 0.001), further supporting CSA's role in
modulating mitochondrial respiration. Next, we attempted to
recapitulate the observed changes in cellular respiration
through activation of the metabolic pathway involved in CSA
biosynthesis. We ﬁrst evaluated CDO1 expression, the enzyme
involved in CSA synthesis, in a panel of glioblastoma lines.
Consistent with tissue samples, CDO1 was differentially
expressed in cell lines, with relatively high levels of expression
in U251 and G179 cells, and little to no expression in T98G and
U87 (Supplementary Fig. S4A). We then sought to determine
whether the upstream metabolite responsible for CSA biosynthesis, L-cystine, which has a well-established role in cross-talk
between astrocytes and neurons, could be metabolized through
this pathway to have a similar effect on cellular respiration as
CSA. Because L-cystine requires a pH of 2.0 to be soluble, a pH
control was used in these studies. As demonstrated in Fig. 2C, Lcystine (100 mmol/L) had a similar effect of attenuating cellular
respiration as CSA in the CDO1-expressing cell line U251. To
more deﬁnitively attribute the metabolic pathway associated
with CSA accumulation to the observed changes in cellular
respiration, we generated a stable knockdown of CDO1 in U251
cells using lentiviral-based shRNA (shCDO; Supplementary
Fig. S4B). The addition of L-cystine to shCDO cells no longer
modulated cellular respiration, whereas CSA continued to
maintain its activity in this line (Fig. 2D and Supplementary
Fig. S5A). To determine whether L-cystine–induced changes
in respiration were attributed to cellular uptake through the
system xc transporter, we pretreated cells with the system
xc inhibitor sulfasalazine (13), which completely abrogated
the inﬂuence of L-cystine on oxygen consumption (Fig. 2E).
Furthermore, the observed CSA-induced changes in OCR
were not observed with the addition of hypotaurine, the
downstream metabolite of CSA (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Collectively, these ﬁndings support the concept that cysteine
catabolism, through the CDO regulatory axis, attenuates
cellular respiration in glioblastoma cells.
We went on to determine whether CSA-induced attenuation
of cellular respiration translated to affecting other aspects of
mitochondrial function. Pyruvate entry into the mitochondria
allows for the generation of ATP through the electron transport
chain, which results in an efﬂux of Hþ, leading to decreased
mitochondrial membrane potential (22, 23). As demonstrated
in Fig. 2F, the addition of pyruvate led to an expected increase
in ATP generation, which was signiﬁcantly inhibited by both
CSA and L-cystine. To study mitochondrial potential, we used
the JC-1 assay (24), which is a ﬂuorescent dye that changes
from red to green as the mitochondrial membrane potential
decreases, signifying an increase in oxidative phosphorylation.
Initial studies used the metabolic modulator dichloroacetate
to serve as proof-of-concept. Dichloroacetate has been previously shown to inhibit PDH kinase (PDK), which is an endogenous inhibitor of PDH. By inhibiting PDK, dichloroacetate in
turn activates PDH, allowing for increased glycolytic ﬂux into

792

Cancer Res; 74(3) February 1, 2014

the mitochondria and decreased mitochondrial membrane
potential (23). The addition of dichloroacetate resulted in an
expected increase in oxygen consumption (Supplementary Fig.
S5B) and decrease in red:green ratio (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. S5C), corresponding to a decrease in mitochondrial
membrane potential and increase in oxidative phosphorylation, which is consistent with its previously described mechanism of action (23). Next, we evaluated the role of CSA in
modulating pyruvate-induced changes in mitochondrial
potential. Similar to the metabolism ﬁndings, pyruvate addition led to an expected increase in oxidative phosphorylation,
resulting in a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential.
The addition of CSA in these conditions increased the red:
green ratio, consistent with an increase in membrane potential
and decreased oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. S5C).
CSA inhibits PDH activity
We went on to determine the mechanism by which CSA
inhibits cellular respiration in our described models. Oxidative
phosphorylation involves pyruvate entry into the mitochondria, which is metabolized through the citric acid cycle. This
results in the generation of NADH and FADH2, which are
oxidized by the electron transport chain, resulting in a proton
gradient. Oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor and
reduced to H2O by cytochrome C oxidase. The resulting proton
gradient generated by the electron transport chain drives the
formation of ATP by the enzyme ATP synthase. As an initial
investigation, we isolated mitochondria in U251 cells to determine whether the inﬂuence of CSA on oxygen consumption
involved inhibiting one of these intramitochondrial steps of
oxidative phosphorylation. As demonstrated in Supplementary
Fig. S5D, the addition of pyruvate, but not glucose, had an
expected increase in oxygen consumption in isolated mitochondria. As opposed to whole cells, the addition of CSA did
not inﬂuence the OCR in isolated mitochondria. This suggests
that CSA modulates OCR by inhibiting pyruvate entry into the
mitochondria. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of CSA to
inhibit PDH activity, which represents a gate-keeping enzyme
regulating glycolytic ﬂux into the mitochondria. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, the addition of CSA to U251 resulted in a
dose-dependent inhibition of PDH, with a maximal inhibition
of approximately 64%  4%. Similar to the above ﬁndings
involving cellular respiration, the addition of the upstream
metabolite L-cystine resulted in a similar inhibition of PDH
activity in the CDO1-expressing cell line U251. The inhibition of
PDH activity by CSA was also observed in T98G cells; however,
L-cystine did not inhibit PDH activity in this non-CDO1–
expressing cell line (Fig. 3B), further supporting the role this
metabolic pathway plays in the observed inhibition of PDH
activity. As proof-of-concept, we did similar studies using
dichloroacetate. As expected, the addition of dichloroacetate
in these conditions resulted in increased PDH activity of
approximately 23%  2% (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the observed
increase in PDH activity was abrogated when dichloroacetate
was combined with CSA, further supporting the role this
metabolite plays in inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation
through the modulation of PDH activity.

CSA (P < 0.005) but not L-cystine (P ¼ 0.67) inhibits PDH activity in the non-CDO–expressing cell line T98G. C, dichloroacetate (DCA; 1 mmol/L) increases
PDH activity in U251 (P ¼ 0.003), which is abrogated with the pretreatment of CSA (1 mmol/L; P ¼ 0.117). Results are representative of at least three
independent experiments.

Inhibiting CDO attenuates glioblastoma growth in vivo
Finally, we determined whether the CDO axis contributes
toward glioblastoma growth. As an initial investigation, we
characterized U251 shCDO cells in vitro. Cellular proliferation,
colony forming capacity, and baseline levels of apoptosis and
redox stress were unchanged in these lines when compared
with the parental and vector control lines (Supplementary Fig.
S6A–S6D). Next, we evaluated in vivo growth rate using a
subcutaneous mouse xenograft model. As demonstrated
in Fig. 4A, U251 shCDO cells had a signiﬁcantly decreased
growth when compared with shControl (P ¼ 0.004), with
Western blot analysis performed on excised tumors demonstrating a 67% and 91% decrease in CDO1 expression (Fig. 4B).
We then extended these studies to evaluate survival using an
intracanalicular model. U251 shCDO cells led to increased
survival when compared with vector control (P ¼ 0.01), with
IHC performed on tumor sections conﬁrming decreased CDO1
expression in these tumors (Fig. 4C and D).

Discussion
A renewed interest in the study of tumor metabolism has led
to several seminal discoveries in Cancer Research. Of these,
perhaps one of the most notable has been the identiﬁcation of
mutations in the metabolic enzyme IDH1 in low-grade glioma
and secondary glioblastoma (5). This led to a series of contributions underscoring the elegant complexity of tumorigenesis, linking a genetic mutation with the formation of a
neomorphic enzyme and novel oncometabolite, 2-HG (3),
which in turn, orchestrates speciﬁc epigenetic programs deﬁning a glioma subtype (4). However, metabolic changes contributing toward the aggressive phenotype typical of highgrade glioma are only beginning to be recognized. The majority
of our understanding of glioblastoma metabolism has been
provided by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Malignant
glioma has been shown to demonstrate a high resonance in
the choline spectral peak and a low NAA (N-acetylaspartate) or
creatine resonance correlating with high choline/NAA or
choline/creatine ratios for areas of active tumors (25). In
addition to choline, relative concentrations of alanine, glycine,
and phosphatidylethanolamine have also been implicated in

glioblastoma metabolism (26). Global metabolomic proﬁling
has provided further insight into metabolic programs driving
the aggressive phenotype of glioblastoma, along with unique
metabolic subtypes with biologic and clinical application (9).
In this report, we describe the discovery of cysteine catabolism through CDO1 expression and biosynthesis of the metabolite CSA as a novel metabolic pathway in glioblastoma.
Speciﬁcally, we identiﬁed grade-speciﬁc changes in CSA levels,
with signiﬁcant intratumoral concordance of CSA with expression of its synthetic enzyme, CDO1. Furthermore, quantitative
increases in CSA between grade 2 and grade 4 glioma were the
highest of all metabolites globally proﬁled. Interestingly, these
studies identiﬁed the metabolite 2-HG as the highest fold
decrease in grade 4 glioma when compared with grade 2
glioma, which is supported by recent studies (3) and reinforces
the concept that unique metabolic programs underlie glioma
grade.
The relevance of cysteine metabolism in cancer has gained
considerable interest in recent years. The generation of GSH
from cysteine, and its associated role in modulating redox
status in tumors, has been well documented. Chung and
colleagues (13) demonstrated the importance of this axis in
glioma models, with further investigations identifying a particular relevance of this pathway in hypoxic conditions (14).
They went on to show cystine uptake was via the system xc
transporter, which mediates the exchange of extracellular
cystine and intracellular glutamate, and blocking this exchange
attenuated tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, the glutamate
exchanged during this process seems to also provide gliomas
with a survival advantage, causing excitotoxic death of neurons
in the vicinity of the tumor (27). Furthermore, the system xc
transporter itself is currently being investigated as a novel
tumor–speciﬁc imaging target, demonstrating the capacity to
localize to areas of oxidative stress (28). Our ﬁndings, which
identify utilization of this alternate, parallel pathway of cysteine catabolism in aggressive brain tumors, provide an additional layer of insight into the contributory role this emerging
metabolic pathway has on gliomagenesis. In addition, these
ﬁndings support the potential for both system xc and CDO to
serve as therapeutic targets in glioblastoma.

Figure 4. CDO modulates glioblastoma growth in vivo. A and B, U251 cells with stable knockdown of CDO1 using shRNA (shCDO; n ¼ 5) or vector
control (shControl; n ¼ 5) were injected subcutaneously in a mouse ﬂank model. Tumor growth curves were obtained at stated time points using
perpendicular diameter measurements of each tumor with digital calipers and volumes calculated using the formula ðL  W  WÞ=2. B, CDO1 expression
determined by Western blot analysis of the indicated tumors grown in the mouse ﬂank model. C, intracanalicular tumors were generated by implanting
shCDO (n ¼ 10) or shControl (n ¼ 10) cells. Mice were euthanized once neurologic symptoms became apparent and survival plotted. D, CDO1 expression
determined by IHC of the indicated tumors grown in an intracanalicular model.

The potential of CSA to serve as neurotransmitter has been
studied (29), although its role in tumorigenesis is largely
undeﬁned. We performed a series of investigations demonstrating the potential of CSA to attenuate oxidative phosphorylation, as measured by OCR, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP production, through inhibition of PDH activity.
Interestingly, attenuated oxidative phosphorylation is emerging as a common metabolic phenotype involved in carcinogenesis. Anso and colleagues (30) identiﬁed the capacity of cMYC to attenuate both baseline OCR and spare respiratory
capacity in osteogenic sarcoma models and Sandulache and
colleagues (31) identiﬁed a diminished spare respiratory
capacity in p53 mutated head and neck cancer models. Speciﬁc
to glioblastoma, Vlashi and colleagues (32) identiﬁed a similar
phenotype in tumor stem cells and progenitor cells when
compared with their differentiated lineages. Despite these
ﬁndings, the selective growth advantage offered by regulating
maximal cellular respiration remains unclear. In our models,
targeting the CDO/CSA pathway only inhibited glioblastoma
growth in vivo. Therefore, we hypothesize that activation of this
metabolic pathway may allow for cellular adaptation to the
glioma microenvironment. With the established antioxidant
role of GSH generated from cysteine in modulating redox

794

stress, it is tempting to speculate that this parallel pathway
offers these rapidly dividing tumors another layer of protection
from endogenous redox damage though decreased production
of free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation. In
addition, inhibiting pyruvate entry into the mitochondria via
PDH inhibition may allow for shunting of glycolytic carbon
away from oxidative phosphorylation, potentially contributing
to the Warburg effect and the anabolic phenotype identiﬁed in
this malignancy (9). Although the effects of CSA on mitochondrial function was identiﬁed in the present study, continued
investigations designed to determine how cooption of this
metabolic pathway in glioblastoma may inﬂuence other
aspects of gliomagenesis, including epigenetic and transcriptional programs, are still required.
Interestingly, two recent reports identiﬁed methylation and
silencing of CDO1 as a common event in tumorigenesis,
suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene (33, 34). Speciﬁcally, Dietrich and colleagues (34) identiﬁed CDO1 promoter methylation in breast cancer and demonstrated its capacity
to serve as a predictive factor for distant metastases. Using a
microarray-based approach, Brait and colleagues (33) identiﬁed CDO1 expression to be modulated in colorectal cancer cell
lines by promoter methylation and following treatment with

Cysteine Catabolism in Glioblastoma

the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine. A high
frequency of CDO1 promoter methylation in colon cancer was
then identiﬁed when compared with normal colon, and ﬁndings were extended to several other malignancies, including
breast, esophagus, lung, bladder, and gastric cancer. They went
on to show that forced expression of CDO1 resulted in
decreased growth in vitro and in vivo. In contrast with these
recent studies suggesting attenuating this pathway contributed toward tumorigenesis, our ﬁndings demonstrate activation
of the CDO1/CSA axis is a common metabolic phenotype
glioblastoma. Cysteine catabolism through the CDO1/CSA
pathway is also well documented in normal brain, which has
largely focused on its role in taurine synthesis (10). Interestingly, regional localization of CDO in rat brain identiﬁed this
enzyme to solely localize in neurons, supporting its potential to
serve as a neurotransmitter (35). We conﬁrmed the relative
increase of CDO1 expression in glioblastoma when compared
with normal brain using the TCGA database (36), identifying
approximately a quartile of glioblastoma to exhibit a signiﬁcant increase in CDO1 expression when compared with normal
brain (Supplementary Fig. S7A), which is consistent with our
data when comparing these tumors to low-grade glioma. In
addition, low levels of CDO1 expression was conﬁrmed in
normal brain sections using IHC (Supplementary Fig. S7B).
Therefore, in the context of these recent publications identifying the contributory role of CDO1 as a tumor suppressor
gene, our ﬁndings suggest co-option of this pathway is likely
cell type–dependent and catabolism through this axis may be
uniquely relevant in glioblastoma biology and its associated
tumor microenvironment.
In summary, we identiﬁed a novel, targetable metabolic
pathway involving cysteine catabolism in glioblastoma. These
ﬁndings serve as a framework for future investigations

designed to determine its clinical application in both the
imaging and treatment of brain tumors and the contributory
role this metabolic pathway has in tumorigenesis.
