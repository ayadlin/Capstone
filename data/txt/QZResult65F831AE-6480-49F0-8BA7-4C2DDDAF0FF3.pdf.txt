Abstract
Engineered chimeric cytokines can generate gain-of-function activity in immune cells. Here, we report potent
antitumor activity for a novel fusion cytokine generated by N-terminal coupling of GM-CSF to IL4, generating a
fusokine termed GIFT4. B cells treated with GIFT4 clustered GM-CSF and IL4 receptors on the cell surface and
displayed a pan-STAT hyperphosphorylation associated with acquisition of a distinct phenotype and function
described to date. In C57BL/6J mice, administration of GIFT4 expanded endogenous B cells and suppressed the
growth of B16F0 melanoma cells. Furthermore, B16F0 melanoma cells engineered to secrete GIFT4 were rejected
immunologically in a B-cell–dependent manner. This effect was abolished when GIFT4-expressing B16F0 cells
were implanted in B-cell–deﬁcient mice, conﬁrming a B-cell–dependent antitumor effect. Human GIFT4-licensed
B cells primed cytotoxic T cells and speciﬁcally killed melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our
results demonstrated that GIFT4 could mediate expansion of B cells with potent antigen-speciﬁc effector
function. GIFT4 may offer a novel immunotherapeutic tool and deﬁne a previously unrecognized potential for
B cells in melanoma immunotherapy. Cancer Res; 74(15); 4133–44. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Cytokine monotherapy for treatment of preestablished cancer has been characterized by modest clinical beneﬁt (1). This
holds true for FDA-approved GM-CSF (2–4) and IL2 (5).
Nevertheless, cytokine-based cancer immunotherapy remains
an active area of clinical research. Leukines such as IL7, IL15,
and IL21 are now being studied in early-phase clinical trials (6–
10). An argument can be made that pharmacologic dosing of
single-agent cytokine is unlikely to provide meaningful
immune stimulus that will overcome the multiplicity of
immune escape mechanisms deployed by prevalent tumor
types (11).
To address this potential limitation, we have developed the
notion that physical coupling of functionally unrelated cytokines may display biochemical properties for which naturally
evolved immune checkpoints deployed by tumors are lacking.
As proof-of-concept, we have previously demonstrated that
coupling of GM-CSF and common g-chain interleukins (aka
GIFT fusokines) leads to novel biochemical properties (12, 13).
When compared with parental cytokines, GIFT fusokines

initiate heretofore unheralded interleukin-receptor–driven
STAT hyperactivation, which leads to enhanced immune antitumor activities via induction of tumor-killer NK cells by GIFT2
(derived from GM-CSF and IL2; refs. 14, 15) or tumoricidal
dendritic cells by GIFT21 (from GM-CSF and IL21; refs. 16, 17).
The notion of coupling GM-CSF to IL4 as a fusokine is
appealing because it is known that their combined use can
induce monocytes to differentiate into dendritic cells (18).
Indeed, many clinical dendritic cell-based cancer immunotherapy protocols utilize GM-CSF and IL4 as a means to
generate autologous antigen-presenting cells (19). Herein, we
derived a novel fusokine: GIFT4 (derived from GM-CSF and
IL4) and have discovered that GIFT4 promotes an entirely
novel B-cell tumoricidal immune response characterized by
both B helper and effector functions. This observation reveals
the potential of both fusokine GIFT4 and GIFT4-licensed B
cells (GIFT4-B cells) as meaningful tumoricidal agents.

Materials and Methods
GIFT4 gene and protein
GM-CSF and IL4 genes (cDNA; Invivogen) were cloned in
frame allowing the expression of the chimeric transgenes and
GIFT4 protein. The crystal structures of human GM-CSF and
IL4 were used for homology modeling of GIFT4 three-dimensional structure on the software PROSPECT v2. GIFT4-encoding retroviral plasmid was introduced into authenticated
GP2-293 packaging cells from Clontech. The retroparticles
were used to genetically modify 293T and B16F0 cells from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) authenticated by
short tandem repeats (STR) analysis. GIFT4-expressing positive clones were selected by single cell culture in 96-well plates.

Similarly, B16F0 cells were genetically modiﬁed to stably
expressing murine GM-CSF or IL4. Cytokine expression was
conﬁrmed by ELISA.
Cell culture
GIFT4-secreting 293T, B16F0, or nontransfected cells were
cultured in DMEM medium. Culture supernatant was concentrated with sterile centrifugal ﬁlter units (Millipore Corporation). Splenic B cells from C57BL/6J (B6) mice were puriﬁed
with pan B-cell enrichment kit (StemCell). Human B cells or T
cells were puriﬁed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) of patients with melanoma with B-cell or T-cell
enrichment kits (StemCell). B cells were cultured in complete
RPMI-1640 medium in 96-well plate (105 cells/well) in presence
of GIFT4, GM-CSF, and IL4 (2ng/mL; PeproTech) for 6 days.
After wash with RPMI-1640 medium, B cells were cultured for
48 hours. The supernatants were then collected for luminex
assay performed in the Human Immunology Monitoring Center at Stanford University (Stanford, CA). GIFT4- or control
cytokine-treated human B cells were cocultured with autologous T cells (1:1) in RPMI-1640 medium for 6 days. Human
A375 melanoma cells (2  104 cells/well) from ATCC authenticated by STR analysis plus gender marker were cocultured
with human T cells for 48 hours in a 96-well plate. After removal
of T cells, melanoma cells were subject to MTT assay as
described (20).
ELISA and Western blot analysis
GIFT4, GM-CSF, IL4, and IFNg were quantiﬁed with ELISA
kits (eBiosciences). GIFT4 was proﬁled by Western blot analysis (WB) with anti-GM-CSF or anti-IL4 antibodies (R&D
Systems). Murine B cells (106 cells/mL) treated with GIFT4,
GM-CSF, and IL4 with or without JAK inhibitors were lysed
with buffer as described (21). STAT phosphorylation in B cells
was determined by Western blot analysis with anti-pSTAT1
(Tyr701, D4A7), anti-pSTAT3 (Tyr705, D3A7), anti-pSTAT5
(Tyr694, D47E7), anti-pSTAT6 (Tyr641, C11A12), or anti-STAT
antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). For immunoprecipitation of GMCSFRb by common gc receptor after GIFT4 or
GM-CSF and IL4 stimulation, the B cells were lysed with buffer
as described (21). One mg of protein per sample was incubated
with 2 mg of anti-common gc or anti-GMCSFR antibodies, or
IgG isotype control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at
4 C. The sample–antibody complexes were incubated with
protein A agarose for 2 hours at 4 C. The bound proteins were
eluted for Western blot analysis with anti-GMCSFR or antiIL4R antibodies.
Confocal microscopy
B cells treated with GIFT4 or GM-CSF and IL4 (20 minutes at
37 C) were ﬁxed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and stained with
goat anti-mouse GMCSFRb (R&D Systems) and rabbit antimouse IL4R antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight
at 4 C. The cells were reacted with Donkey anti-rabbit Alexa
488 and Donkey anti-goat Alexa 555 (Invitrogen) at room
temperature for 2 hours, and mounted with ProLong Gold
Antifade Reagent with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI),
and imaged under a Zeiss LSM 510 Confocal microscope.

Flow cytometry
GIFT4-treated splenocytes or B cells were proﬁled by ﬂow
cytometry (FACS) with antibodies against murine B220, CD3,
CD19, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD27, CD40, CD69, CD80, CD83,
CD86, MHCII, and IgM by FACS on a BD FACSCanto II ﬂow
cytometer. For GM-CSF staining, B cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized with BD Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm solution followed by
anti-GM-CSF antibody staining. Human B cells were treated
with human GIFT4, or GM-CSF and IL4 (20 ng/mL) for 6 days,
and analyzed by FACS with a panel of antibodies against
human B-cells. Cytotoxic T cells were proﬁled with anti-human
CD3, CD8, CD314, INFg, granzyme B, and granulysin antibodies
(BD). FACS data were analyzed with FlowJo 9.1 software.
Melanoma mouse model
B16F0, melan-a GNAQQ209L cells [from Dr. Boris Bastian (coinventor) at University of California, San Francisco, authenticated by detecting a mutation in a Gnaq gene by PCR;
San Francisco, CA], B16-GIFT4 cells, or B16-GMCSF/IL4 cells
(106/mouse) were subcutaneously implanted into syngeneic B6
mice or Rag1/, CD4/, CD8/, mMT, IFNg / (B6.129S7Ifngtm1Ts/J), or IL10/ (B6.129P2-IL10tm1Cgn/J) mice. On day
5, B6 mice pre-established with B16F0 or melan-a GNAQQ209L
melanoma tumors were intravenously administered with three
doses of murine GIFT4 (100 ng/day/mouse) with 2-day
interval. In addition, B16-GIFT4 cells were subcutaneously
immunized into B6 mice for one month. Puriﬁed splenic B
cells (10  106 cells/mouse) from immunized mice were
adoptively transferred into B16F0 tumor pre-established mMT
mice (n ¼ 5 per group). B16-GIFT4 or B16F0 cells (106 cells/
mouse) in Matrigel solution (BD) were subcutaneously injected
into B6 mice for 7 days. Tumors were harvested and digested as
described (14). Inﬁltrating lymphocytes were isolated with
Lymphocyte Separation Medium (Mediatech). For examining
the antimelanoma function of human GIFT4, human A375
melanoma cells (2  105 cells/mouse) were subcutaneously
implanted into NOD-scid IL2Rg null (NSG) mice. On day 5, human
PBMC (10  106 cells/mouse) were intravenously injected into
the mice, supplemented with three doses of human GIFT4, GMCSF and IL4 (100 ng/day/mouse), or PBS with 2-day interval.
Alternatively, human B-cell primed T cells were intravenously
injected into NSG mice with pre-established A375 melanoma.
Tumor growth was measured with a digital caliper. All mice (6–
8-week-old) were from Jackson Laboratory. The use of mice and
the recruitment of patients with melanoma were approved by
Emory University (Atlanta, GA).
Statistical analysis
Data were shown as mean  SEM. P values were calculated
using the ANOVA test or two-tailed Student t test in Supplementary Fig. S3D. P<0.05 was considered signiﬁcant ( , P < 0.05;

, P < 0.01;  , P < 0.001).

was detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). To test the
effect of GIFT4 on resting leukocytes, splenocytes from na€ve
B6 mice were stimulated with murine GIFT4 or control cytokines. We observed that GIFT4 triggers the expansion of
splenocytes (Supplementary Fig. S1A) predominantly in the
B-cell compartment (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). Working with puriﬁed splenic B cells, we conﬁrmed that murine
GIFT4 induced the robust proliferation of B cells (Fig. 1D–F).
Luminex analysis on the culture supernatant of B cells showed
that GIFT4-B cells produced signiﬁcantly higher levels of
cytokines IL1a, IL6, IL12 (Fig. 1G) as well as IL5 and VEGF
(Supplementary Fig. S2), compared with GM-CSF and IL4 or
PBS treatments. Intriguingly, we observed that murine GIFT4 B
cells secreted massive amounts of GM-CSF and CCL3 (Fig. 1H),
with undetectable IL10 and very low levels of IFNg (Fig. 1G),
IL2, IP-10, IL17, IL13, KC, RANTES, and TNFa (Supplementary
Fig. S2). In contrast, there was no GM-CSF and CCL3 secretion
from control B cells (Fig. 1H). Intracellular cytokine staining
further conﬁrmed the secretion of GM-CSF by GIFT4-B cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B), which is 10-fold higher than
controls. Phenotyping GIFT4-B cells by FACS with a panel of
antibodies against murine B-cell surface markers demonstrated that akin to GM-CSF and IL4-treated control B cells, GIFT4B cells express CD19, CD22, and IgM. Distinct to control B cells,
GIFT4-B cells downregulated CD23 and substantially upregulated CD19, CD25, CD27, CD40, CD69, MHCI/II, CD80, CD83,
and CD86 (Fig. 1I). To test the effect of GIFT4 stimulation on Bcell STAT signaling, splenic B cells were stimulated with GIFT4
and compared with controls. We observed that GIFT4 on its
own leads to hyperphosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5,
and STAT6 contemporaneously in B cells in a manner distinct
to that observed with control cytokine treatment (Fig. 2A). To
test whether JAKs are involved in GIFT4-induced STAT hyperphosphorylation, B cells were incubated with JAK inhibitors
before GIFT4 stimulation. We observed that inhibition of JAK2
or JAK3 completely abrogated STAT1 phosphorylation; suppression of JAK1 or JAK3 robustly reduced the phosphorylation
of STAT3, STAT5 and STAT6. Collective inhibition of JAKs
completely interrupted STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6
signaling (Fig. 2A). Consequently, blocking JAK1, JAK2, or JAK3
with its inhibitors dramatically suppressed GIFT4-induced Bcell proliferation (Fig. 2B). To test ability of GIFT4 to cluster
GMCSFR and IL4R on B-cell surface, coimmunoprecipitation
was performed with anti-GMCSFR or anti-IL4R antibodies on
the lysates from treated B cells. Indeed, GMCSFR was pulled
down with IL4R after GIFT4 treatment (Fig. 2C), but not after
GM-CSF and IL4 stimulation. Confocal microscopy with antiGMCSFR and anti-IL4R antibodies (Fig. 2D and E) further
conﬁrmed the colocalization of GMCSFR and IL4R on GIFT4treated B cells (Fig. 2E), but not on control cytokine-treated
cells (Fig. 2D).
GIFT4 robustly expands endogenous B cells and
promotes antitumor immunity
B cells play important roles in host immunity against
pathogens (22) and tumors (23, 24). We therefore investigated
whether the hypermorph effects of GIFT4 on B cells lead to an
enhanced B-cell–driven immune response. To test the immune

effect of murine GIFT4 in vivo, GIFT4 or GM-CSF and IL4 were
intravenously administered into B6 mice. After one week,
GIFT4-treated mice developed splenomegaly (Fig. 3A) in comparison with GM-CSF and IL4- or PBS-treated mice, with
marked expansion of splenocytes (Fig. 3B). Mice treated with
GM-CSF and IL4 showed normal sized spleens as well as the
number of splenocytes (Fig. 3A and B). Proﬁling B220þ cells
and CD3þ cells demonstrated that there was a 3-fold expansion
of splenic B cells in GIFT4-treated mice (Fig. 3C), and modest
but signiﬁcant expansion of T cells (Fig. 3C) in comparison
with GM-CSF and IL4- or PBS-treated groups. Intracellular
staining further conﬁrmed the induction of GM-CSF–secreting
B cells by GIFT4 (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D), akin to the
recently described innate response activator (IRA) B cells (22).
The percentage of GM-CSFþ B cells in GIFT4-treated mice is
more than 30-fold higher when compared with GM-CSF and
IL4-treated controls (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D) and the
latter is similar to untreated mice. To test whether GIFT4
protein promotes a therapeutic antitumor response in vivo, we
implanted B16F0 melanoma cells into B6 mice and 5 days later
treated mice with GIFT4, GM-CSF and IL4, or PBS. We
observed signiﬁcant suppression of melanoma growth in
GIFT4-treated mice (Fig. 3D). As an independent validation
of antimelanoma activity, we implanted B6 mice with syngeneic melan-a cells stably transduced with GNAQQ209L as
described (25). In comparison with GM-CSG and IL4 or PBS
treatments, GIFT4 signiﬁcantly inhibited melan-a GNAQQ209L
tumor growth (Fig. 3E).
GIFT4-triggered antitumor immunity is B-cell
dependent
To further test the antitumor function of GIFT4, we generated genetically modiﬁed B16F0 melanoma cell lines stably
expressing murine GIFT4, GM-CSF, or IL4 cytokine. The tumor
cells were implanted into B6 mice. Twenty days later, mice
implanted with wild-type B16F0 cells or with an admixture of
B16F0-GMCSF and B16F0-IL4 cells developed melanoma
tumors (Fig. 4A). However, tumor growth was substantially
inhibited in mice implanted with B16-GIFT4 cells, indicating
that GIFT4 expression signiﬁcantly suppressed melanoma
tumor growth (Fig. 4A). To analyze whether GIFT4 expression
affects the inﬁltration/expansion of B or T lymphocytes in
tumor microenvironment, B16-GIFT4 cells, B16-GMCSF þ IL4
cells, or B16F0 cells were embedded in Matrigel and implanted
into B6 mice. One week later, Matrigel implants were surgically
excised, enzymatically dissociated, and cellular content analyzed by FACS. Consistent with GIFT4-induced splenic B-cell
expansion, GIFT4 expression by B16F0 cells resulted in the
robust increase of B-cell and T-cell number in tumor microenvironment (Fig. 4B). To further determine the role of B cells
and T cells in GIFT4-triggered antimelanoma immunity, we
implanted B16-GIFT4 cells in Rag1/ mice that lack functional B and T cells. We observed that B16-GIFT4 tumor grew
quickly in Rag1/ mice (Fig. 4C) conﬁrming the pivotal role of
lymphoid cells in antitumor effect of GIFT4. To test the
hypothesis that B cells play a pivotal role in GIFT4-triggered
antitumor response, we implanted B16-GIFT4 cells into B-cell–
deﬁcient mMT mice and observed a robust growth of

melanoma tumors (Fig. 4C). To further test whether GIFT4-B
cells can serve as T-cell helpers and promote antitumor
immunity, T cells were cocultured with GIFT4-B cells or
control B cells. Quantiﬁcation of IFNg secretion in the culture
supernatant by ELISA showed that GIFT4-B cells markedly
enhanced T-cell IFNg production (Supplementary Fig. S4),
whereas GM-CSF and IL4-treated B cells have little effect
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Using knockout mice, we conﬁrmed
that mice deﬁcient in IFNg, but not IL10, could not suppress
melanoma growth (Fig. 4D). To further deﬁne the relative
contribution of T-cell subsets in GIFT4-driven antimelanoma
response, we implanted B16-GIFT4 cells in CD4 or CD8 T-cell–

melanoma tumoricidal activity. To investigate whether
GIFT4-B cells from B16-GIFT4 cell-immunized mice could
rescue antitumor immunity in B-cell–deﬁcient mice, we performed adoptive transfer experiments. We implanted B16GIFT4 cells into mMT mice and when mice developed palpable
melanoma tumors, splenic B cells puriﬁed from immunized B6
mice were adoptively transferred. Measurement of tumor size
showed that adoptive transfer of GIFT4-B cells from immu-

Human ortholog of GIFT4 induces B-effector immune

To test whether human GIFT4 deploys similar B-cell stimulatory antimelanoma function as murine GIFT4, we cloned
human GIFT4 cDNA and genetically modiﬁed 293T cells.
Human GIFT4 protein sequence is showed in Fig. 5A, and
intact protein expression was conﬁrmed by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 5B). To examine the effect of human GIFT4
on B cells, we puriﬁed B cells from PBMC isolated from
patients with melanoma (n ¼ 6). Treatment of B cells with
human GIFT4 revealed that GIFT4 induced robust proliferation of peripheral B cells (Fig. 5C and D). Phenotyping by FACS
showed that human GIFT4-B cells are CD20þ, CD22þ, CD80þ,
CD86þ, MHCIþ, and MHCIIþ, with enhanced expression of
CD27, CD40, and CD83; but are absent of CD23 and CD138

with T cells (from patients with melanoma) primed by GIFT4-B
cells (GIFT4 T cells) or T cells primed with GM-CSF and IL4treated B cells (GMCSF/IL4 T cells). We have observed that
GIFT4 T cells killed the majority of melanoma cells within 48hour coculture, without affecting the growth of HUVEC; in
contrast, GMCSF/IL4 T cells had little killing effect on melanoma cells (Fig. 6F). To test the hypothesis that human
GIFT4 has similar antimelanoma effect in vivo as murine
GIFT4, we implanted A375 cells into NSG mice. On day 5, ten
millions of PBMC from patients with melanoma were delivered into the mice, supplemented with injection of human
GIFT4, or GM-CSF and IL4. In comparison with GM-CSF and
IL4 treatment or control group without PBMC, GIFT4
administration signiﬁcantly reduced human melanoma
growth in mice (Fig. 6G). To test whether the GIFT4 T cells
could kill human tumor cells in vivo, A375 melanoma cells
were implanted into NSG mice, supplemented with an
intravenous injection of GIFT4 T cells or GMCSF/IL4 T cells.
Monitoring human melanoma growth demonstrated that
adoptive transfer of GIFT4 T cells could directly kill human
melanoma cells in the mice (Fig. 6H). However, the mice
developed large human melanoma tumors on day 30 when
delivered with GMCSF/IL4 T cells or without T cells (Fig 6H).
Using B cells and T cells from healthy donors, we found that
GIFT4-licensed B cells and primed T cells have similar
antimelanoma functions to the ones from patients with
melanoma (Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6F).

Discussion
B cells are a population of heterogeneous lymphocytes
where effector and suppressor subsets cohabitate (26, 27). B
cells can promote tumor growth (28) by inhibiting T-cell
tumoricidal activities (29, 30). Conversely, B cells can secrete
antitumor cytokines (24) and facilitate T-cell antitumor function (31, 32). Virtually all studies here cited examining B-cell
effector function in antitumor immunity examined the biology
of primeval B cells bereft of pharmacologic activation. Herein,
lays the novelty of GIFT4 as a B-cell tropic immune stimulator.
Distinct from IL4 and GM-CSF, GIFT4 fusokine deploys a gainof-function hyperphosphorylation of STATs through assembly
of GMCSFR and IL4R on B-cell surface. The consequences of
this pan STAT activation on B cells are protean, including a
robust mitogenic response and phenotypic conversion to a
unique B-effector phenotype characterized by expression of
B220, CD19, CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, and IgM, but not CD23.
Furthermore, GIFT4-B cells generate a unique secretome
distinct from other known B-effector phenotypes described
in mice, including: IL1a, IL6, IL12, IL5, VEGF, GM-CSF, and
CCL3. There is no report that STAT phosphorylation results in
CCL3 secretion by normal B cells; however, BCR stimulation
can activate leukemic B cells to produce CCL3 (33). GIFT4-B
cells display functional feature reminiscent of IRA-B (22),
producing GM-CSF. Unlike IRA-B cells, GIFT4-B cells are
CD40þCD80þCD86þ and produce little IL3. GIFT4-B cells are
also distinct from B1 and B2 cells, of which B1 cells are B220low,
and B2 cells are CD23þ (34). IL12 has antitumor capacity to
reconstitute the immune cellular microenvironment within

4142

Cancer Res; 74(15) August 1, 2014

tumors (35), and that produced by GIFT4-B cells may play a
similar role. To our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst report that
activated normal B cells can produce chemokine CCL3. Therefore, GIFT4-B cells have a distinct cytokine-secreting proﬁle
that can enhance T-cell antitumor immunity.
Interestingly, GIFT4 expands B cells including GM-CSF–
secreting IRA-like B cells. GM-CSF has been shown to increase
the proliferation of antigen-activated cytotoxic T cells (36); and
CCL3 is critical for recruiting CCR5þ T cells in antitumor
immunity (37), suggesting that GM-CSF and CCL3-producing
GIFT4-B cells may provide a direct helper effect toward T-cell
immunity against tumors. Because activated CD80þCD86þ B
cells are potent antigen-presenting cells that can generate
autologous antigen-speciﬁc cytotoxic T cells against melanoma (38, 39), this feature may also be operative in GIFT4-B cells.
The sum of these features may provide a mechanistic rationale
for B-cell–dependent antimelanoma-driven effect of GIFT4.
Indeed, we can map out a cascade of interaction where GIFT4B cells license T cells to markedly increase IFNg production,
cytotoxic factors granzyme B and granulysin secretion, and
NKG2D/CD314 expression.
The human ortholog of GIFT4 behaves similarly to murine
GIFT4 and functions as an immune stimulator to induce the
proliferation of human peripheral B cells. Like murine GIFT4-B
cells, human GIFT4-B cells bear the typical surface costimulatory markers such as CD80, CD86, MHC I, MHC II, and
enhance autologous T-cell activation, proliferation, and IFNg
production. In addition, both murine and human GIFT4-B cells
secrete common cytokines and chemokines such as IL6, GMCSF, and CCL3. However, human GIFT4-B cells have a unique
secretome proﬁle, producing substantial amount of T-cell–
supportive cytokine IL2 and driving a CD8 T-cell response. B
cells can enhance granzyme-Bþ cytotoxic CD8 T-cell survival
(40), and tolerize CD8 T cells (39, 41). We found that human
GIFT4-B cells trigger an antitumor immune response by
cytotoxic CD8 T cells derived from patients with melanoma.
Those GIFT4-B cell primed T cells express tumor cytotoxic
factors, and can directly kill human melanoma cells. The
unique property of GIFT4-B cells and GIFT4-B cell primed
autologous T cells from patients with melanoma provides a
potential novel strategy for personalized cell immunotherapeutic against melanoma.
In summary, our data demonstrate that GIFT4 fusokine
deploys a unique STAT activation response in na€ve B cells,
which converts them to helpers of T-cell activity as well as
tumoricidal effectors via their immune-stimulatory effects.
These observations support the notion that chimeric cytokines
such as the fusokine GIFT4 here described can lead to a
hypermorph phenotype and function of B cells and pharmacologic utility in ailments amenable to an enhanced immune
response.
