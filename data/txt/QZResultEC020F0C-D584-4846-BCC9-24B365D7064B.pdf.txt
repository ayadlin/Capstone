Differentiation

Abstract
There is a growing interest in the cell–cell communication roles in cancer mediated by secreted vesicles
termed exosomes. In this study, we examined whether exosomes produced by cancer cells could transmit
information to normal stromal fibroblasts and trigger a cellular response. We found that some cancer-derived
exosomes could trigger elevated a-smooth muscle actin expression and other changes consistent with the
process of fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts. We show that TGF-b is expressed at the exosome
surface in association with the transmembrane proteoglycan betaglycan. Although existing in a latent state,
this complex was fully functional in eliciting SMAD-dependent signaling. Inhibiting either signaling or
betaglycan expression attenuated differentiation. While the kinetics and overall magnitude of the response
were similar to that achieved with soluble TGF-b, we identified important qualitative differences unique to
the exosomal route of TGF-b delivery, as exemplified by a significant elevation in fibroblast FGF2 production.
This hitherto unknown trigger for instigating cellular differentiation in a distinctive manner has major
implications for mechanisms underlying cancer-recruited stroma, fibrotic diseases, and wound-healing
responses. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9621–30. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles secreted by diverse
cell types that play complex roles in intercellular communication (1). They comprise a ceramide- and cholesterol-rich lipid
bilayer membrane (2), an array of membrane and cytosolic
proteins (3) and selected RNA species (4). This molecular
complexity suggests that exosomes may mediate a variety of
physiologic functions, perhaps through several different
mechanisms. There is currently considerable interest in understanding the complex communicative roles exosomes play in
physiology and the molecular mechanisms underlying these.
Some mechanisms by which exosomes mediate their
biological functions have been characterized. Exosomes
may act as natural vehicles for delivering protein (5), mRNA
(4), or microRNA (6) to recipient cells. A further mechanism
involves the direct engagement of receptors/ligands at the
recipient cell surface during exosome interactions (7). In
addition, some recent reports have described the expression
of growth factors, or other usually soluble mediators, found

in association with the exosome membrane. Examples
include expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a;
ref. 8), epidermal growth factor (EGF; ref. 9), fibroblast
growth factor (FGF; ref. 10), and others. Collectively, such
data suggest a possible physiologic role for exosomes as a
novel means of disseminating growth factors and other
mediators within the extracellular milieu.
Our own previous studies have demonstrated the expression
of TGF-b by cancer-derived exosomes and linked this with their
immunosuppressive properties (11, 12). These findings were
confirmed recently by others (13). Mechanistic studies of
exosomal TGF-b remain incomplete, and the potentially broad
influence exosomal TGF-b could play in other, non-immune,
biological systems has not yet been explored. To gain more
insight into these aspects of exosome function, we chose to
focus on a biological function of TGF-b that is of major
importance in health and disease conditions: the induction
of fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblasts. We hypothesize
that cancer exosomes can alter the function of healthy fibroblast present within the tumor stroma, leading to alterations
that may promote tumor growth and progression.
Myofibroblasts are a contractile cell type, characterized by
the expression of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA; ref. 14).
During normal wound healing, myofibroblasts are transiently
present, responsible for closure of the wound and formation of
the collagen-rich scar matrix (15). When persistent in tissues,
they are a well-established early histologic marker of progressive organ fibrosis, acting inappropriately to modulate the
extracellular milieu and altering tissue architecture (15).
Myofibroblasts are also relevant in solid cancers in which
an altered stroma, rich in myofibroblastic cells, can support
tumor growth, vascularization, and metastasis (16–18). TGF-b

remains among the key factors responsible for the development of a myofibroblastic phenotype from a variety of precursor cells, including fibroblasts (15). TGF-b binds
sequentially to type II receptor and then type I receptor
(ALK5), resulting in the formation of an activated receptor
complex (19). Type III TGF-b receptors, known as betaglycan
(20), do not play a direct role in TGF-b signaling but may act to
facilitate binding of TGF-b to type II receptors (21). Activation
of ALK5 triggers a signaling cascade, involving phosphorylation of SMAD2 and 3, which subsequently mediate binding to
SMAD4. This SMAD complex translocates to the nucleus to
initiate transcription of a host of genes, including a-SMA (22).
SMAD-independent signaling pathways also exist (23) and
contribute to other aspects of a myofibroblastic phenotype
such as alterations in the pericellular milieu (24).
In this report, we examined whether cancer exosomes can
trigger TGF-b signaling pathways and thereafter initiate a
program of differentiation of fibroblasts toward a myofibroblastic phenotype. The data demonstrate exosomal delivery of
TGF-b as a previously unknown mechanism capable of driving
cellular differentiation of fibroblasts, resulting in a myofibroblast phenotype that is similar but not identical to that
achieved with soluble TGF-b. The study has broad implications for how growth factors are disseminated in the extracellular environment during health and disease conditions
and highlights a previously unknown function for cancer
exosomes as novel modulators of stromal cell differentiation.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
A panel of cancer cell lines, as exosome producers, is maintained in bioreactor culture flasks, as described (12). Cells
included a mesothelioma cell line (established within the
department from pleural effusion of a mesothelioma patient);
prostate cancer cells (LNCAP, DU145, and PC3) from American
Type Culture Collection; a bladder cancer line, HT1376, and a
colorectal cancer line (CaCo2), from Cancer Research UK; and a
breast cancer line (MCF7), from the European Collection of Cell
Cultures. Primary fibroblasts (AG02262) from Coriell Institute
for Medical Research (Camden, NJ), were used at passages 7 to
9 as exosome responder cells, following growth arrest in serumfree media for 48 hours. All purchased cells were obtained
during 2008 to 2009 and passaged for less than 6 months in
culture. Cell lines were authenticated by the supplier cell bank
by combinations of cytogenetic, isoenzymatic, and DNA profile
analyses. All cultures were maintained in 5% to 10% FBS that
had been depleted of bovine exosomes by overnight ultracentrifugation at 100,000  g and serial filtration (0.2 and 0.1 mm).
rhTGF-b1 was from Peprotech.
Exosome purification
Cell culture medium was subject to serial centrifugation,
(300  g for 10 minutes, 2,000  g for 15 minutes, and 10,000  g
for 30 minutes), and exosomes were purified from the supernatant by the 30% sucrose/D2O cushion method (11). Exosome
quantity was determined by the micro BCA protein assay
(Pierce/Thermo Scientific).

Determine exosome density
A pellet obtained from 70,000  g ultracentrifugation of
culture medium was overlaid onto a prepoured sucrose
gradient (0.2–2.5 mol/L of sucrose). Specimens were
centrifuged at 4 C overnight at 210,000  g, using an
MLS-50 rotor in an Optima-Max ultracentrifuge (Beckman
Coulter). The refractive index of 16 collected fractions was
measured at 20 C, using an automatic refractometer
(J57WR-SV; Rudolph Research). The refractive index was
converted to density, using the conversion table published
in the Beckman Coulter ultracentrifugation manual as
described (25, 26).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Quantitation of TGF-b1 and FGF2 proteins was performed
using the DuoSet ELISA Development System (R & D Systems)
and manufacturer's protocol.
SMAD3 reporter assay
Assessment of TGF-b signaling through an SMAD3-dependent pathway was performed as described (27) by transfecting HK2 cells (from ATCC) with an SMAD3-responsive
promoter construct (SBE)4-Lux (0.9 mg) and a Renilla vector
(0.1 mg) to monitor transfection efficiency, using the transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a ratio of
3:1 (microliters of lipofectamine:micrograms of DNA) in
serum-free and antibiotic-free medium. Twenty-four hours
after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and the
medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing
purified exosomes or rhTGF-b1 for a further 6 hours. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Glo luciferase
activity kit (Promega Ltd.) as per the manufacturer's
protocol. Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla
activity.
Immunohistochemistry of a-SMA
Indirect immunohistochemistry was performed following
fixation in ice-cold acetone:methanol (1:1). Blocking and antibody (anti-a-SMA; Santa Cruz) incubations were performed in
Hank's balanced salt solution (Sigma). For microscopic visualization of cells, a secondary goat anti-mouse Alexa-488-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen) was used. To quantify changes
in a-SMA, this was substituted for a goat anti-mouse biotin
conjugate (Perkin Elmer), and detected using a streptavidineuropium conjugate. Expression levels were measured on a
Wallac Victor2 1420 plate reader (Perkin Elmer).
Quantification of hyaluronic acid coat thickness
Hyaluronic acid (HA)-dependent, cell-associated pericellular matrices were visualized and measured, as previously
described (28).
Flow cytometry of exosome-coated beads
Exosomes were coupled to the surface of aldehyde sulfate–
latex beads (Interfacial Dynamics) in an MES buffer (at a ratio
of 1 mg of exosomes:1 mL of stock beads) and analyzed by flow
cytometry as previously described (25). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using mouse monoclonal antibodies

specific to human CD9 (R & D Systems) and human betaglycan (Santa Cruz), corresponding mouse IgG isotype controls
(eBioscience), and an Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Invitrogen).
Pervanadate-induced cleavage of betaglycan
Exosomes were added to mesothelioma cells and incubated
at 37 C for 4 hours in either the absence or presence of
pervandate (200 mmol/L), previously shown to instigate cleavage of betaglycan (29). Exosomes were then repurified and
quantified, as described previously, prior to further analysis.
RNA extraction
RNA was extracted from cultured cells, using the Purelink
RNA Mini kit (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol.
Reverse transcription
Reverse transcription was performed using a high-capacity
cDNA reverse transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems), in a final
volume of 20 mL per reaction, as described in the manufacturer's protocol, using an Applied Biosystems ''Gene
Amp PCR System 2400'' thermocycler.
Real-time quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out in a final volume
of 20 mL per reaction, containing 1 mL of cDNA, 10 mL of
TaqMan Universal Master Mix (20) (Applied Biosystems),
8 mL of H2O, and 1 mL of a TaqMan gene expression assay
primer and probe mix (Applied Biosystems). A negative control (PCR) was prepared with H2O substituted for the cDNA.
The PCR amplification was performed in a StepOne Real-Time
PCR System thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Amplification was carried out by heating the samples to 50 C for
2 minutes, then at 95 C for 10 minutes, followed by repeating
cycles of 95 C for 15 seconds and 60 C for 1 minutes, for a total
of 40 cycles. The comparative Ct method was used for relative
quantification of target gene expression against that of a
standard reference gene (GAPDH). Data were analyzed using
StepOne software from Applied Biosystems UK Ltd.

Results
Cancer exosomes express latent TGF-b but can trigger
the SMAD3-related signaling pathway
We have previously shown by ELISA that cancer exosomes,
isolated from cultured mesothelioma cells, express TGF-b1
(11). It is possible that during the exosome purification
process involving high-speed ultracentrifugation, TGF-b
may be co-pelleted with exosomes and hence may not be
genuinely expressed in association with the vesicle. To clarify
this issue, we performed a classical purification of exosomes,
using a sucrose gradient, as described (26). This technique
separates exosomes from nonexosomal soluble contaminants
by virtue of the biophysical nature of vesicles, which float on
sucrose at particular densities (typically around 1.1–1.2 g/mL
for most exosome types).
Exosomes were initially concentrated from mesothelioma
cell culture medium by spinning at 70,000  g, and on

www.aacrjournals.org

performing a sucrose gradient, the density of collected fractions was measured, and thereafter fractions were analyzed by
Western blot, TGF-b-ELISA, and an SMAD3 reporter assay.
The Western blot revealed that the multivesicular body marker TSG101, used as a marker for exosomes, was principally
present in fractions 9 to 14 (density of 1.096–1.23 g/mL;
Fig. 1A). This is broadly consistent with similar studies of
exosomes from other cellular sources (7). Performing a TGF-b
ELISA on these fractions revealed little TGF-b present outside
the exosome density range, with fractions 9 to 14 comprising
84.2% of the total TGF-b present. This demonstrates that
the TGF-b present within the 70,000  g pellet of culture
medium is predominantly present at exosomal densities
(Fig. 1A, black bars), with the remainder at hyperdense fractions (which contained trace amounts of TSG101), which may
be due to exosome aggregates and/or nonexosomal constituents. However, to be certain that soluble TGF-b cannot float at
these densities as well, an additional gradient run was performed, loading rhTGF-b instead of concentrated exosomes.
On this occasion, the majority (92.8%) of TGF-b was localized
within the first 4 fractions (density 1.02–1.04 g/mL) and not at
exosomal densities (Fig. 1A, line graph). The data show that
TGF-b has a molecular association with exosomes and that
this association does not provide information regarding exosomal TGF-b function. We therefore examined whether exosomes were capable of activating TGF-b signaling pathways.
To do this, we transfected cells with an SMAD3 promoter
element upstream of luciferase and measured the activation of
SMAD3-dependent transcriptional activity by chemiluminescence (27). The sucrose gradient fractions (as described earlier) were used and showed a weak background SMAD3
activity (11.5% of total activity) at hypodense fractions (1.0–
1.08 g/mL). The majority of transcriptional activity was found
at exosomal densities (65.3% of total) (Fig. 1A, gray bars).
Again, there was some activity present at hyperdense fractions, consistent with the TGF-b ELISA and trace TSG101
levels by Western blot. We conclude, therefore, that the cancer
exosomes that express functional TGF-b1 are capable of
triggering the SMAD3-dependent intracellular signaling pathway. To determine whether this was applicable to other
cancers, we purified exosomes from a diverse panel of cancer
cell lines, using a sucrose cushion method (11), and, as
described earlier, examined TGF-b expression by ELISA and
function by SMAD3 reporter assay. The data show that not all
cells produce TGFb-positive exosomes. Exosomes isolated
from a prostate cancer cell (LNCAP) and from a colorectal
cancer cell line (CaCo2) had low or undetectable levels of TGFb, respectively (Fig. 1B, black bars). The sensitivity of the assay
was 20 pg/mL. Other cell types (DU145 or PC3, prostate cancer
cells), however, produced exosomes with similar levels of TGFb1 compared with the mesothelioma cell line (Meso). When
comparing TGF-b1 expression levels and SMAD3 transcriptional activity, there was a good correlation: exosomes highest
in TGF-b1 eliciting the strongest activation of SMAD3-dependent signaling (Fig. 1B, gray bars). The ELISA approach
requires the liberation of TGF-b1 from a nonfunctional latent
complex by brief acid treatment to allow the capture and
detection antibodies to bind TGF-b. This measurement

Figure 2. Cancer exosomes trigger a-smooth muscle (a-SAM) actin expression in fibroblasts. A, primary fibroblasts were growth arrested for 72 hours prior
to stimulation with exosomes isolated from various cell lines as specified (at a dose of 200 mg/mL). As a positive control, fibroblasts were treated with
rhTGF-b1 (5 ng/mL). After a further 72 hours, the fibroblasts were examined by immunohistochemistry for the expression of a-SAM. Scale bar, 100 mm.
B, similarly, fibroblasts were stimulated with exosomes (mesothelioma exosomes shown) or rhTGF-b1 in the presence or absence of a TGF-b1–neutralizing
antibody (at 10 mg/mL) or an irrelevant isotype-matched antibody (at 10 mg/mL). Also, selected regions exemplify the a-SMA–positive filamentous structures
along the longitudinal axis of the fibroblast cell body that are apparent on rhTGF-b1 (red box) or exosome treatment (blue box). Scale bar, 100 mm.
C, comparison of the kinetics of induced a-SMA expression over a 14-day period, with growth-arrested fibroblasts left untreated (gray circles) and treated with

preparations. By ELISA, data revealed that approximately 2%
of the exosomally associated TGF-b is constitutively active,
hence 98% exist in a latent form (Fig. 1C). We next performed
this comparison by using the SMAD3 assay, revealing that
there was a little functional difference between active and
total (acid-treated) exosomal TGF-b (Fig. 1D, left), and the
magnitude of response to exosomal TGF-b in this assay was
80% to 95% of that achieved with rhTGF-b (in which 100% is in
an active form) (Fig. 1D, right). Together, the data show for the
first time that some cancer cells produce exosomes that
express latent TGF-b1, which is presented to recipient cells
in a fully biologically available manner, eliciting an SMAD3
signaling response of similar magnitude to that achieved using
nonlatent rhTGF-b.
TGF-bhigh cancer exosomes trigger a-SMA expression
We next investigated the effects of TGF-b-expressing exosomes on fibroblasts. It is well established that soluble TGF-b
induces the key phenotypic marker of myofibroblasts, a-SMA,
which involves its assembly into contractile stress fibers along
the longitudinal axis of the cell body. Using immunohistochemistry, we visualized the expression of a-SMA in growth-arrested
primary fibroblasts that had been left untreated for 72 hours, or
stimulated either with rhTGF-b or with exosomes (from various cellular sources). As expected, by 72 hours, rhTGF-b
strongly induced a-SMA expression. Exosomes that expressed
low or intermediate levels of TGF-b (as shown in Fig. 1B, black
bars) did not trigger a-SMA expression above that of untreated
cells (Fig. 2A, left column). In contrast, exosomes expressing 6
pg or more of TGF-b/mg of exosomes were effective at inducing
this phenotypic alteration (Fig. 2A, right column). These
changes, induced by TGF-bhigh exosomes, were morphologically comparable with the changes triggered by rhTGF-b, with

www.aacrjournals.org

cells exhibiting the classical filamentous structures of a-SMA
typical of myofibroblasts (Fig. 2B, blue and red boxes). To
determine whether this effect was dependent on exosomal
expression of TGF-b, or perhaps due to some other exosomal
constituent(s), we repeated the experiments in the presence of
a TGF-b neutralizing antibody. This was effective in abrogating
a-SMA induction by both treatments (Fig. 2B), whereas an
isotype-matched monoclonal antibody had no effect. TGF-b is
known to drive long-lasting phenotypic change in fibroblasts;
we therefore compared the kinetics of a-SMA induction triggered by rhTGF-b with that triggered by exosomes (Fig. 2C).
The data reveal that changes elicited by each treatment were
similar. Both triggered rapid elevation in expression (2-fold
increase by 24 hours), reaching a peak of expression by day 3,
although the exosome-mediated increase was less pronounced
than that driven by rhTGF-b under these conditions. Thereafter, a-SMA levels reverted slightly by day 7 (16.9% decrease in
rhTGF-b, 17% decrease in exosome groups) but remained well
above untreated levels for at least 14 days. In conclusion, cancer
exosomes that express relatively high levels of TGF-b can drive
fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation. This effect is longlasting and comparable with that achieved using rhTGF-b.
TGF-bhigh cancer exosomes trigger the formation of a
hyaluronic acid pericellular coat
An additional key feature of myofibroblast differentiation is
the alteration in the immediate pericellular microenvironment.
One classical indicator of this is the formation of a pericellular
coat comprised largely of HA surrounding the myofibroblast
cell body (28). Such HA coats are barely detectable around
fibroblasts. We visualized HA coats by using fixed erythrocytes
that are electrostatically repulsed by HA, revealing a region of
exclusion around the cell body. Growth-arrested fibroblasts

Figure 3. Cancer exosomes trigger deposition of a hyaluronic acid pericellular coat. A, growth-arrested fibroblasts were treated for 72 hours with 200 mg/mL
of either CaCo2-derived exosomes (which are TGF-b1low) or with PC3-derived exosomes (TGF-b1high). As a positive control, fibroblasts were stimulated
with rhTGF-b1 (5 ng/mL). A type I TGF-b-RI inhibitor (SB431542, at 10 mmol/L) was added to some wells as indicated. After a further 72 hours,
hyaluronidase (HAidase) was added (at 200 mg/mL) to some wells as indicated. After washing, formalin-fixed horse erythrocytes were added and
allowed to settle (for at least 15 minutes, at 37 C). Scale bar, 100 mm. B, regions of exclusion (examples indicated by arrows) were measured for 20
representative cells for each treatment condition, and the pericellular thickness (calculated as described in Materials and Methods) is shown. Graph

difference method.

exhibited very slender HA coats (Fig. 3), whereas rhTGFb–mediated myofibroblast differentiation demonstrated significantly broader regions of exclusion. This phenomenon was
also apparent when stimulating growth-arrested fibroblasts
with cancer exosomes, but again this was related to the TGF-b
content of exosomes (Fig. 3). HA coat formation, in response to
either cancer exosomes or rhTGF-b, was shown to be TGF-b
dependent, as it was attenuated by the addition of the TGF-b
receptor I (TGF-b-RI) inhibitor SB431542. The region of erythrocyte exclusion was confirmed to be composed of HA by
digestion of the coat with protease-free hyaluronidase. We
conclude that exosomal TGF-b can cause alterations, including
modulations in pericellular microenvironment, in fibroblasts
that exhibit multiple hallmarks of myofibroblasts.
Exosomes require betaglycan expression for
tethering TGF-b
The aforementioned data have posed the question: How is
TGF-b physically associated with exosomes? TGF-b may be
rendered membrane associated, such as through interactions
with certain integrins (avb1, avb6, a8b1), with endoglin, with
thrombospondin, or by binding to the type III receptor
betaglycan (30). The exosomal expression of such molecules
with roles in TGF-b tethering function(s) has not been
shown. We initially focused on possible expression of betaglycan by cancer exosomes, as previous pilot data from our
allied studies had suggested proteoglycans might be
expressed by exosomes. We purified exosomes from several
cancer cell lines, including those high and those low in TGF-b
expression. Following coupling to latex beads (25), the exosome–bead complexes were stained with betaglycan-specific

9626

Cancer Res; 70(23) December 1, 2010

or isotype-matched control antibodies and analyzed by flow
cytometry. Betaglycan showed strong staining at the exosome surface; this was true of multiple preparations from 3
different cancer cell lines that had high levels of TGF-b
(mesothelioma, PC3, and DU145 cells) (Fig. 4A and B).
However, exosomes from cancer cells that had low levels
of TGF-b (CaCo2 and HT1376 cells) exhibited markedly lower
(4- to 5-fold) levels of betaglycan (Fig. 4A and B). Plotting
exosomal surface betaglycan expression versus exosomal
TGF-b levels reveals a significant correlation (r2 ¼ 0.8894,
P < 0.0001; Fig. 4C). In contrast, plotting TGF-b levels against
another exosomal surface protein, CD9, revealed no such
correlation (r2 ¼ 0.1224, with the slope not significantly
different from zero, P ¼ 0.201). The data suggest that betaglycan may, at least, be partly involved in binding TGF-b at
the exosome surface. We therefore attempted to show
whether or not this was so, using a siRNA approach. While
selective knockdown of betaglycan mRNA in cancer cells was
achievable with moderate efficiency (50%–60% decrease in
betaglycan mRNA), it was difficult to scale up these experiments to provide sufficient quantity of exosomes for functional assays. Nevertheless, this approach supported the
premise of betaglycan involvement, as the small amounts
of exosomes available exhibited approximately 30% reduction in TGF-b levels compared with scrambled siRNA controls (Supplementary Figure S1). As an alternative approach,
we utilized pervanadate as a reagent that induces the release
of betaglycan from cell surfaces (29). Purified mesothelioma
exosomes were exogenously added to mesothelioma cells in a
normal (without pervanadate) or a betaglycan-cleaving
microenvironment (with pervanadate). After 4 hours, the

exosomes were retrieved and washed. Flow cytometric analysis of exosome–bead complexes showed that pervanadate
treatment had little effect on exosomal CD9 expression
(Fig. 4D, white bars) yet reduced exosomal betaglycan by
around 40% to 50% (Fig. 4D, black bars). In addition, analysis
by ELISA revealed a similar reduction in exosomal TGF-b
levels by pervanadate treatment (Fig. 4E); similarly, the
induction of a-SMA expression by fibroblasts was reduced
by around 50% (Fig. 4F). We conclude that TGF-b is associated with betaglycan at the exosome surface and that the
loss of exosomal betaglycan expression can attenuate its
capacity to induce myofibroblastic differentiation.
TGF-bhigh cancer exosomes induce transcription of
mRNAs that is similar but not identical to that induced
by rhTGF-b
An issue that remains unknown is whether the fibroblast
response to exosomal TGF-b differs from that of soluble
TGF-b. To answer this question, we used qPCR to examine a
panel of transcripts, known to be elevated in fibroblasts
following stimulation with rhTGF-b. The effects of exosomes
from mesothelioma cells (TGF-bhigh), from CaCo2 cells
(TGF-blow), and rhTGF-b were compared, and we also
included the TGF-b-RI inhibitor (SB431542) to evaluate
the contribution of exosomally expressed TGF-b to any
observed effects. Autocrine production of TGF-b is an
important feature of myofibroblastic phenotype (27). Stimulating with rhTGF-b (5 ng/mL) induced around 4-fold
elevated mRNA for TGF-b at 72 hours, and this effect was
abrogated fully in the presence of SB431542, as expected
(Fig. 5A). Mesothelioma-derived exosomes (at a dose of
200 mg/mL of exosomes), broadly equivalent to 1.5 ng/mL
of exosomal TGF-b, resulted in an enhanced induction of
TGF-b-mRNA (accounting for TGF-b dose correction). This
effect was also abrogated by the inhibitor and was not seen
in fibroblasts stimulated with equal dose of CaCo2 exosomes
(Fig. 5A). Some other altered transcripts, including transcripts of cTGF and EGF, were also induced by exosomes in
a manner comparable with rhTGF-b. Any induction seen
here was attenuated by the TGF-b-RI inhibitor in all cases,
and again CaCo-2–derived exosomes had little effect on
these mRNAs. Examining FGF2 mRNA, however, highlighted
that TGF-bhigh exosomes may well trigger a cellular response
that is not identical to that driven by rhTGF-b. Where
mesothelioma exosomes stimulated a strong induction
(12- to 16-fold) in FGF2 mRNA, rhTGF-b treatment only
modestly (2-fold) induced FGF2 mRNA even at a dose that
was 3 times higher than the exosomal TGF-b equivalent.
Again, CaCo2 exosomes had no effect on FGF2 mRNA. This
robust stimulation was dependent on exosomal TGF-b, as
the TGFb-RI inhibitor completely abrogated the response.
We examined by measuring FGF2 in cell culture media by
ELISA whether this observation related to the actual FGF2
protein secreted by these fibroblasts. This revealed superior
induction of FGF2 protein by mesothelioma exosomes compared with an equivalent dose of rhTGF-b (1.5 ng/mL
shown), which was highly significant (Fig. 5B). Stimulation
with 1.5 or 5 ng/mL of rhTGF-b had little or no effect on

Figure 5. Induction of transcripts by cancer exosomes is similar but not
identical to that induced by rhTGF-b. A, growth-arrested fibroblasts were
treated with rhTGF-b1 (5 ng/mL) or with exosomes from mesothelioma cell
line (Meso) or from a colorectal cancer cell line (CaCo2) each at 200 mg/mL,
corresponding to 1.5 ng/mL and less than 20 pg/mL of exosomal TGF-b1,
respectively. An inhibitor of TGF-b signaling (SB431542 at 10 mmol/L) was
added, as indicated, and after 72 hours, total RNA was extracted and
processed for qPCR. Graphs depict results from 4 independent
experiments, expressing mRNA levels for TGF-b1, cTGF, EGF, and FGF2

secreted FGF2 levels, requiring a very high dose of 10 ng/mL
to elicit an induction in FGF2 protein. Again, CaCo2 exosomes did not affect the levels of FGF2. In summary, many
classical TGF-b responses are triggered by TGF-bhigh exosomes in a manner similar to that achieved with soluble
nonvesicular TGF-b. Importantly, however, there may be
some differences in the overall response, as exemplified by
changes in FGF2 expression, in which exosomes exert a
significantly more potent influence.

Discussion
We present, for the first time, evidence that exosomes from
some cancer cells can drive multiple changes in fibroblasts.

Cancer Exosomes Trigger Fibroblast Differentiation

These alterations are consistent with full differentiation into
myofibroblasts, a significant and physiologically important
process with major implications in health and pathologic
conditions. We also establish that exosomally expressed
TGF-b1 is responsible for this differentiation.
Exosomal expression of TGF-b has been previously
reported by us (11, 31) and subsequently by others (13),
but it has always remained possible that this apparent
exosomal TGF-b may simply be due to soluble TGF-b that
co-pellets with exosomes during high-speed ultracentrifugation. Using ultracentrifugation on continuous sucrose gradients, as previously described (26), reveals that TGF-b floats
at characteristic exosomal densities. The fractions containing this vesicular TGF-b were also the fractions that harbored the capacity to activate TGF-b signaling in an SMAD3
reporter assay. Hence, TGF-b is genuinely expressed by
cancer cell–derived exosomes and this vesicular form of
TGF-b is biologically active in driving SMAD-dependent
signaling. Surprisingly, exosomal TGF-b appears mostly
(98%) in a latent form, yet, when administered to cells,
is utilized almost fully in terms of signal transduction, giving
levels of SMAD3 activity around 80% to 90% of that achieved
using rhTGF-b.
While the precise mechanism of how latent exosomal
TGF-b is delivered and activated at the cell surface is not
known, we now present evidence that implicates betaglycan
in a TGF-b-tethering role. This proteoglycan plays important
functions in binding TGF-b and increases its affinity for
binding to type II receptor when expressed at the cell surface
(30). We demonstrate that exosomes with low levels of
surface betaglycan expression exhibit low TGF-b levels
and do not induce fibroblast differentiation. In contrast,
some exosomes stained very strongly for surface betaglycan
and it was only these exosomes that had sufficient TGF-b
levels for driving fibroblast differentiation. Partial cleavage
of betaglycan from the exosome surface was achieved by
pervanadate treatment, which leads to shedding of betaglycan from the cell surface (29). Using this approach, abrogating exosomal betaglycan expression resulted in decreased
exosomal TGF-b levels and a comparable decrease in its
capacity to activate a-SMA expression by fibroblasts. The
data show exosomal betaglycan expression as a relevant
factor in the tethering of TGF-b to the exosome surface, and
unlike soluble betaglycan, exosomes deliver functional TGFb to recipient cells.
In terms of biological function, the impact of cancer
exosomes on primary fibroblasts is profound. Stimulating
with exosomes, high in TGF-b, triggered sustained changes
in the actin cytoskeleton, with a dramatic upregulation of
structural a-SMA remaining elevated for at least 14 days.
The nature and kinetics of this classic feature of differentiated myofibroblasts were comparable with that triggered
by rhTGF-b and were absolutely dependent on exosomal
TGF-b rather than other exosomal components, as it could
not be reproduced by exosomes that were poor in TGF-b.
However, SMAD-dependent changes of this nature are also
accompanied by SMAD-independent effects, such as the
deposition of a pericellular coat composed of HA (28). This

www.aacrjournals.org

shows that the exosomal mechanism for TGF-b delivery is
not limited to SMAD-related pathways and may well be
equal to the diversity of responses generated using soluble
TGF-b. HA is a major component of the pericellular matrix
surrounding tumor cells and has previously been linked to
tumor progression and dissemination (32, 33). Our data
show exosomes as an additional mechanism contributing
toward a modulated stromal-extracellular matrix, as a consequence of fibroblast differentiation.
Exosomes or soluble TGF-b appeared to drive these
effects with comparable efficacy. We therefore examined
other candidate responses to highlight any distinction in
the cellular response to exosomal versus soluble TGF-b.
This was essentially not apparent when examining mRNA
for cTGF or EGF, although there may be a slight advantage
in terms of exosome-mediated autocrine production of
TGF-b mRNA. However, induction of FGF2 by tumor exosomes was an aspect that was clearly distinct between the
treatment conditions, with significant elevation in mRNA
and protein seen with exosomes but not triggered at
comparable doses with soluble TGF-b. This shows that
the fibroblast response to tumor-derived exosomes differs
in this regard to that of soluble TGF-b. Considering the role
of FGF2 in directly promoting tumor growth/survival,
migration and metastasis, matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis [reviewed in (34)], our data suggest a physiologic
role for exosomal TGF-b in biasing the fibroblast response
toward such tumor-promoting functions. Given the molecular complexity of exosomes, however, we do not know
how such vesicles mediate this preferential FGF2 responsiveness. It requires exosomal TGF-b together with 1 or
more additional exosomally delivered constituents; these
factors are not present when treating with soluble TGF-b
alone.
The importance of this exosomal mechanism in vivo is
currently unknown. Recently, Rab GTPases, Rab27a and
Rab27b, have been shown to play important roles in regulating
exosome secretion (35). These are therefore good candidate
target proteins to achieve a global blockade of exosome
secretion by tumor cells in vivo. Furthermore, we propose
strategies, such as targeting betaglycan, to modify the exosome phenotype that could be employed to test the importance of exosomal TGF-b specifically in modulating the tumor
stroma in vivo.
While much of the research within the exosome field
continues to focus on immunomodulatory functions (5, 7,
8, 11, 31, 36), a small number of reports show that cancer
exosomes may well be capable of altering the functions of
nonimmune cells within the tumor microenvironment. For
example, cancer exosomes can exert a proangiogenic influence on endothelial cells (37). To date, however, our report is
the first to highlight the capacity of cancer exosomes to
profoundly modulate fibroblast phenotype and function and
show exosomal TGF-b as the mechanism for this. The data
implicate cancer exosomes as mechanistic participators in
the establishment and persistence of cancer-altered stroma
and suggest designing therapies targeted toward attenuating
cancer exosomes may prove fruitful.
