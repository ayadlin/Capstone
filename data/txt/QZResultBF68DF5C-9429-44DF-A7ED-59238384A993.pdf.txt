Abstract

Author Manuscript

Disruption of epithelial organization and loss of growth control are universal features of
carcinomas, yet how these features are linked during cancer progression remains poorly
understood. Cell polarity proteins control cellular and tissue organization and are emerging as
important mediators of cancer progression. The Par3 polarity protein is a molecular scaffold that
functions to recruit and spatially organize signaling factors, and was recently identified as a
suppressor of breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Here we show that loss of Par3 in mammary
epithelial cells promotes apoptosis and that oncogenic Notch overcomes the apoptotic signal to
reveal an unexpected pro-proliferative role for loss of Par3 in mammary tumors. In this context,
loss of Par3 deregulates Rac1 activity to activate Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK)-dependent
proliferation and tumor growth. Thus, we demonstrate a mechanism by which loss of Par3
promotes proliferation and tumorigenesis, which supports a tumor suppressive function for Par3 in
the mammary epithelium.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Epithelial integrity is coupled to apoptosis and proliferation to control tissue size and
organization.1-3 Loss of epithelial homeostasis, characterized by loss of epithelial
organization and growth control, promotes development of carcinomas.4 Understanding how
these processes are integrated is important to further understand mechanisms of cancer
progression.

The Par complex (Par3, Par6, aPKC, and Cdc42) localizes to tight junctions and is a major
regulator of epithelial homeostasis.5, 6 The relationship between the Par complex, cell
proliferation, and apoptosis is complex and incompletely understood. Over-expression of
Par6 causes increased proliferation in epithelial cells, which requires aPKC and Cdc42, but
not Par3, and acts through ERK1/2.7 Furthermore, expression of an N-terminally deleted
mutant of Par6 also increases proliferation, but this is offset by an aPKC-dependent increase
in apoptosis.8 Inhibition of the Par6/aPKC interaction using a pharmacological inhibitor can
block transformed cell growth of lung cancer cells,9 and RNAi knockdown of aPKC
strongly promotes apoptosis.8, 10 Deletion of Par3 in skin caused reduced ERK-dependent
growth and survival and increased apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.11
Alternatively, loss of Par3 in the mammary epithelium resulted in stunted mammary ductal
outgrowths with elevated proliferation that is offset by a parallel increase in apoptosis.12
Interestingly, increased proliferation is also noted in Par3-depleted MCF10A mammary
cells.13 Therefore, there is an important relationship between Par3, proliferation, and
apoptosis that is incompletely understood.

Author Manuscript

A key function of Par3 is to recruit and spatially organize signaling factors that regulate
downstream signaling pathways, such as Rho-family GTPases. Independent of Par6/aPKC,
Par3 binds and sequesters the Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rac-GEF) Tiam1 to
locally regulate Rac1 activity, and loss of Par3 deregulates Rac1 activity in several cell
types.14-18 There is emerging evidence linking Rac1 activation to cancer progression in
multiple cancer types. A constitutively active Rac1 variant (Rac1b) is over-expressed in lung
and breast cancers, and Rac1 activity correlates with lung tumor growth and more
aggressive breast cancers.19, 20 Furthermore, activating Rac1 mutations identified in breast
cancer cell lines have transforming properties.21 Despite that some mutations in Rac1 have
been identified across cancers, the most common mode of deregulated Rac1 activity in
tumors results from disrupted upstream signaling.22 Ablation of the Rac1-GEF, Tiam1,
reduces metastasis in an ErbB2 mouse model of breast cancer,23 and loss of Par3 in ErbB2
mouse mammary tumors also promotes invasion and metastasis through Tiam1-mediated
Rac1 activation.13
Par3 is down-regulated in breast and other cancers and we, and others, have recently
reported that Par3 is an important mediator of tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis in
vivo.11, 13, 24 However, how loss of Par3 promotes mammary tumorigenesis, despite
inducing apoptosis, is not understood. Here we demonstrate that oncogenic suppression of
apoptosis enables loss of Par3 to promote mammary tumor growth through a Tiam1/
Rac1/JNK proliferation pathway.

Results and Discussion
Loss of Par3 triggers both apoptosis and proliferation
The Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) induces non-metastatic mammary tumors in mice
and is associated with poor prognosis in humans.25, 26 Importantly, NICD-induced tumors
retain luminal epithelial characteristics,27, 28 making it an ideal model to dissect the
mechanisms of polarity signaling in cancer. To study a role for Par3 in mammary tumor
growth, we transduced freshly isolated primary mouse mammary epithelial cells (MECs)

with lentivirus to express NICD and control (shLuc) or Par3-directed (shPar3) shRNA and
transplanted them into the mammary fat pad of recipient mice.24 After 25 weeks, tumors
were removed, imaged, and measured. We found that Par3-depleted tumors were markedly
larger than control (Figure 1a, b). Immunostaining tumor sections for Ki67 revealed that
Par3-depletion promoted a ~4-fold increase in the proportion of Ki67 positive cells (Figure
1c, d), indicating that loss of Par3 promoted proliferation, which is consistent with the
increased tumor size observed.

Author Manuscript

To explore a mechanism by which loss of Par3 promoted tumor growth, we infected MECs
at high efficiency with lentivirus to express NICD and shRNAs with a GFP marker, and
grew them in suspension culture to form tumorspheres (Figure S1a).27 To verify that
tumorspheres resemble primary tumors, we immunostained sections for keratins-8 (K8) and
−14 (K14), markers of luminal and basal cells, respectively. Most of the cells in the NICD/
shLuc tumorspheres were dual-positive (K8+/K14+), as was true of the primary tumors
(Figure S1b). Notably, loss of Par3 increased the heterogeneity both in vivo and in the
tumorspheres (Figure S1b). Importantly, the Par3-shRNA phenotype was rescued by
expressing human, RNAi-resistant Par3 together with the murine-specific Par3 shRNA,
confirming that the changes are specific to silencing of Par3 and are not caused by off-target
effects (Figure S1b). Therefore, the primary tumorspheres resemble the in vivo tumor
phenotype and represent a valid in vitro tumor model.

Author Manuscript

NICD expression significantly promoted tumorsphere growth (Figure 1e, f), consistent with
previous reports of a role for NICD in tumor proliferation.27 Loss of Par3 alone did not
promote growth of primary MEC spheroids, as compared to the shLuc control. Strikingly,
however, loss of Par3 in the context of NICD expression increased tumorsphere growth by
~3-fold, and co-expression of RNAi-resistant human Par3 suppressed this increase,
confirming the specificity of the effect (Figure 1e, f). Consistent with our in vivo data, loss
of Par3 in tumorspheres also increased proliferation ~4-fold (Figure 1g, h), although the
absolute proliferation rates were slightly lower in culture than in vivo.

Author Manuscript

We previously reported that loss of Par3 significantly increased both cell proliferation and
apoptosis in the mammary epithelium in vivo.12 We speculated, therefore, that induced
apoptosis might mask growth-promoting effects of Par3 depletion. To test this hypothesis
we depleted Par3 from MECs and after 5 days in suspension culture blotted cell lysates for
cleaved Caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis. Consistent with our previous results,12 Par3
depletion increased levels of cleaved Caspase-3 (Figure 1i). Next, we asked whether
inhibiting apoptosis was sufficient to allow growth of Par3-depleted spheroids.
Pharmacological inhibition of apoptosis with a Caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) in
control cells had a minimal effect on growth (Figure 1j, k), consistent with the finding that
there is negligible apoptosis in these cells (Figure 1i). In contrast, Caspase-3 inhibition
caused a 5-fold increase in the growth of Par3-depleted spheroids (Figure 1j, k). This
indicates that loss of the Par3 polarity protein triggers two opposing responses in the same
cell population, increased apoptosis and increased proliferation. Since NICD can suppress
apoptosis,27 we speculated that NICD may enable proliferation in the absence of Par3 by
inhibiting apoptosis induced by loss of Par3. Indeed, NICD expression efficiently
suppressed Caspase-3 activation in Par3-depleted MECs (Figure 1i).

Tiam1-Rac1 signaling drives proliferation in Par3-depleted tumor cells

Author Manuscript

Rac1 can stimulate cell proliferation,22, 29 and loss of Par3 can cause inappropriate
activation of Rac1.14, 18 Therefore, to determine whether Rac1 activity was necessary for
tumorsphere growth associated with loss of Par3 we first grew tumorspheres in the presence
or absence of NSC23766, an inhibitor that blocks Rac1 activation by specific GEFs, Tiam1
and Trio.30 Under these conditions, NICDS/shLuc tumorsphere growth was not affected, but
growth of NICD/shPar3 tumorspheres was suppressed (Figure 2a, b).

Author Manuscript

To determine whether activation of Rac1 was able to promote NICD-dependent tumorsphere
growth, we transduced MECs with NICD plus GFP, dominant-negative Rac1T17N, or
constitutively active Rac1G12V. Notably, expression of Rac1G12V with NICD promoted
tumorsphere growth ~3-fold above the level induced by NICD alone (Figure 2c, d).
Furthermore, expression of NICD/RacT17N diminished tumorsphere size relative to NICD
alone, indicating that Rac1 may have a general role in survival or proliferation of the
tumorspheres. Next, to examine whether loss of Par3 alters Rac1 activity in tumorspheres
we measured Rac1-GTP levels using a GLISA assay and found a significant 1.5-fold
increase in the global activation of Rac1 in Par3-depleted tumorspheres compared to the
NICD/shLuc control (Figure 2e). In contrast, NICD expression alone had no effect on Rac1
activity, indicating that NICD does not activate Rac1 to promote tumorsphere growth
(Figure S2a). Together, these results support a role for Rac1 in regulating tumorsphere
growth in the context of disrupted Par3.

Author Manuscript

Par3 can repress Rac1 activity through sequestration of the Rac1-GEF, Tiam1,14, 17, 18
suggesting that Tiam1 might mediate the tumorsphere growth driven by Par3 depletion. To
examine this possibility we first over-expressed Tiam1 with NICD and found that the
resulting tumorspheres were ~2-fold larger than those with NICD alone (Figure 2f, g).
Furthermore, Tiam1 expression was sufficient to induce a ~4-fold increase in sphere size in
the absence oncogenic NICD (Figure S3a, b). To test if Tiam1 is necessary for tumorsphere
growth induction by loss of Par3, we depleted Tiam1 using shRNA. Two independent
Tiam1 shRNA constructs (ShT1-3 and shT1-4) were found to efficiently deplete Tiam1
(Figure S2b) and were able to suppress tumorsphere growth induced by loss of Par3 (Fig.
2h, i). Collectively, these results support a role for Tiam1-Rac1 in driving cell proliferation
triggered by loss of Par3 in NICD-dependent tumors.
Rac1 promotes proliferation through JNK

Author Manuscript

Rac1 can signal through JNK to control cell proliferation,31 and disruption of the Parcomplex can regulate JNK activity in Drosophila.32 To test if Par3 acts through JNK in our
model, we treated tumorspheres with a JNK inhibitor (SP600125). We found that JNK
inhibition blocked tumorsphere growth induced by loss of Par3 (Figure 3a, b). JNK
inhibition also suppressed tumorsphere growth induced by Tiam1 or constitutively active
RacG12V expression (Figure S3a-d), consistent with a requirement for JNK in proliferation
downstream of Tiam1/Rac1 activation induced by loss of Par3. Next we examined whether
loss of Par3 induced JNK activation in tumorspheres. Indeed, loss of Par3 increased
phospho-JNK levels above basal levels (Figure 3c), and this effect was blocked by coexpression of dominant negative RacT17N (Figure 3d), indicating that Par3 acts through

Rac1 to activate JNK. Finally to determine whether loss of Par3 regulates JNK signaling in
vivo, we immunostained NICD/shLuc and NICD/shPar3 tumor sections for phospho-JNK
(Figure 3e). We observed a robust difference in the proportion of NICD/shPar3 cells
positive for nuclear phospho-JNK compared to NICD/shLuc (30% versus 1%) (Figure 3f).
Since disruption of polarity can alter growth and survival through MAPK signaling,7, 11 we
also examined this pathway. However, we found no differences in phospho-ERK1/2 levels
between NICD/shLuc and NICD/shPar3 tumorspheres (Figure S3e), indicating that MAPK
signaling is unlikely to be involved in proliferation driven by loss of Par3 in this context.
These results demonstrate that depletion of Par3 acts through Tiam1-mediated Rac1
activation to induce JNK-mediated proliferation in mammary tumors.

We next asked whether Rac1 activation is sufficient to promote mammary epithelial
proliferation in the absence of oncogenic NICD. To this end, we expressed GFP, wild-type
Rac1, dominant negative Rac1T17N or constitutively active Rac1G12V in primary MECs in
suspension culture. Strikingly, expression of constitutively active Rac1G12V was sufficient
to induce a ~20-fold increase in spheroid growth (Figure 4a). To determine whether Rac1
drives growth of mammary epithelial cells in vivo, we performed mammary transplants with
control MECs or those expressing dominant-negative Rac1T17N, or constitutively active
Rac1G12V. After 8-weeks of regeneration, control outgrowths filled 72% of the mammary
fat pad (5/6 transplants had outgrowths), whereas those expressing Rac1T17N filled only
13% (4/6 transplants) (Figure 4b, c). In contrast, mammary outgrowths expressing Rac1G12V
filled 100% of the fat pad (6/6 transplants). We examined whether differences in ductal
growth reflected differences in proliferation by staining for Ki67 (Figure 4d). We found that
mammary glands expressing active Rac1G12V had a ~5-fold increase in the number of Ki67positive cells (Figure 4e), indicating increased proliferation in these glands. We also
consistently found that glands expressing dominant negative Rac1T17N had a reduced
number of Ki67-positive cells, however this was not statistically significant (Figure 4e). To
confirm a role for JNK downstream of Rac1 in vivo, we stained tissue sections for phosphoJNK (Figure 4f). As expected, glands expressing active Rac1G12V had ~5-fold increased
proportion of cells with nuclear phospho-JNK compared to control glands (Figure 4g). As
with Ki67 staining, we noted a consistent, but statistically insignificant decrease in the
proportion of cells with nuclear phospho-JNK in cells expressing dominant negative
Rac1T17N (Figure 4g). Interestingly, JNK1/2 knockout mice do not exhibit defects in
mammary epithelial growth in vivo, indicating that JNK1/2 are not essential and that other
growth pathways compensate to ensure normal development.33 Notably, no tumors were
detected in mice containing MECs transduced with Rac1G12V. Therefore, elevated Rac1
activity promotes mammary proliferation but is not sufficient for oncogenic transformation
in this context. This is consistent with a recent report for lung cancer, where expression
Rac1b synergized with K-Ras to increase lung tumor growth, but alone did not induce
tumorigenesis.20
Most human tumors arise from epithelial tissue, and although they often retain epithelial
features, are nonetheless highly disorganized. Disrupted apical-basal polarity frequently
results in apoptosis, which may act as a protective mechanism against damaged cells. The

switch from apoptosis to uncontrolled proliferation therefore represents an important process
for tumor progression. In Drosophila, clonal patches of epithelial cells that lack the Scribble
polarity protein are eliminated through JNK-dependent cell death, which is induced by
neighboring normal cells.34 Notably, however, expression of oncogenic Ras or Notch blocks
apoptosis and converts JNK activation into a proliferative signal that promotes tumor growth
and metastasis.35 The underlying process most likely involves a normal, compensatory
proliferative response to apoptosis that has been deregulated by oncogenic stimuli. Whether
any similar mechanisms occur in mammals has not been established. Our data now reveal a
parallel but distinct system operating in mammary cells. Loss of the Par3 polarity protein,
which disrupts epithelial integrity, triggers both an apoptotic program and increased
proliferation in normal epithelial cells. Oncogene activation blocks apoptosis and uncovers a
proliferative response (Figure 4h). The underlying mechanism caused by loss of Par3 is an
inappropriate activation of Rac1, which is a sufficient to stimulate proliferation through the
activation of JNK. However, contrary to the situation in Drosophila, the two arms of the
signaling response to Par3 depletion are unlinked. JNK activation does not stimulate
apoptosis, and the proliferative signal does not arise as a compensatory response to the
induction of apoptosis.

Author Manuscript

The regulation of Rac1-dependent signaling by cell polarity proteins may be an important
mechanism of tumor progression. Our results are consistent with those of Xue and
colleagues showing that loss of Par3 activates Rac1 through Tiam1.13 Surprisingly,
however, although they confirmed our previous result that loss of Par3 alone promotes
proliferation in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells,12 Par3 depletion did not further
enhance tumor growth in the context of the ErbB2 oncogene.13 This outcome may be
because ErbB2 itself strongly activates JNK signaling,36, 37 which may mask an effect by
loss of Par3. Given that defects in polarity and growth control are common early in cancer
progression, we anticipate that the interplay between the two are of widespread importance
in malignant transformation of breast and other cancers.

Figure 1. Loss of Par3 cooperates with NICD to promote mammary tumor growth

Author Manuscript

(a) Mammary tumors from mammary epithelial cells expressing NICD/shLuc (control) or
NICD/shPar3 (shRNA sequence: shPar3 5’-acaagcgtggcatgatcca). Primary mammary
epithelial cells (MECs) were isolated from wild-type mice, infected with lentivirus to
express NICD and shRNA, then transplanted into the cleared mammary fat pad. (b)
Volumes of NICD/shLuc and NICD/shPar3 tumors were calculated using the formula
V=□/6×(length×width2). (c) Tumor sections were immunostained for Ki67 (1:100, Abcam).
(d) Quantification of cells with nuclear Ki67 from (c). Two regions from each of 3 tumors
were analyzed for each. (e) MECs were infected with lentivirus to express shLuc, NICD/
shLuc, shPar3, NICD/shPar3, or NICD/shPar3/hPar3 and were grown in suspension cultures
for 9 days to form tumorspheres. hPar3 is resistant to the mouse-specific Par3 shRNA. (f)
Quantification of tumorsphere sizes from (d). The area of each tumorsphere was measured
using a custom ImageJ macro. Each independent experiment contained at least 30
tumorspheres. (g) Tumorspheres were grown for 4 days, then immunostained for Ki67.
Arrows show Ki67 positive cells. (h) Quantification of cells with nuclear Ki67 from (g); n=
4 independent experiments. (i) Cell lysates were prepared from tumorspheres and
immunoblotted for cleaved Caspase-3 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) or actin (1:1000,
Sigma) as a loading control. (j) MECs expressing shLuc or shPar3 were treated with DMSO

for 9 days in suspension culture. (k) Quantification of tumorspheres in (j). n=3 independent
samples, unless otherwise noted. Error bars=sd. p-values were calculated using the student’s
t-test (b, d, h) or the ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc test (f, k) using SPSS software.
Scale bars=1 cm (a); 20μm (c); 1 mm (e); 200μm (j).

Figure 2. Loss of Par3 promotes tumorsphere growth through Rac1 activation by Tiam1

Author Manuscript

(a) Tumorsphere cultures of MECs expressing NICD/shLuc or NICD/shPar3 in the presence
or absence of 25 μM Rac1 inhibitor (NSC23766, Tocris). (b) Quantification of tumorspheres
sizes from (a). (c) Tumorsphere cultures of MECs expressing NICD, NICD/Rac1T17N
(dominant negative), or NICD/Rac1G12V (constitutively active). (d) Quantification of
tumorsphere sizes from (c). (e) Levels of total active Rac1-GTP were measured in NICD/
shLuc and NICD/shPar3 tumorspheres using a GLISA assay kit (Cat. # BK128,
Cytoskeleton Inc.), n=5. (f) Tumorsphere cultures of MECs expressing NICD or NICD/
Tiam1. (g) Quantification of tumorsphere sizes from (f). (h) Tumorspheres of MECs
expressing NICD/shLuc or NICD/shPar3 and one of two Tiam1 shRNA (shRNA sequences:
shTiam1-3 5’-cgatgactttatatttata; shTiam1-4 5’-tttcgtgctatgatgaatc). (i) Quantification of
tumorsphere sizes in (h), n=4. n=3 independent samples, unless otherwise noted. p-values
were calculated using the ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc test (b, d, i) or the student’s ttest (e, g). Error bars represent sd. Scale bars=1mm.

Figure 3. Par3 regulates tumor growth by activating JNK

Author Manuscript

(a) Tumorsphere cultures of MECs expressing NICD/shLuc or NICD/shPar3 in the presence
or absence of 25μM JNK inhibitor (SP600125, Sigma). (b) Quantification of tumorsphere
sizes from (a), n=3. (c and d) Immunoblots of NICD/shLuc and NICD/shPar3 tumorsphere
lysates (c) or co-expressing dominant negative HA-Rac1T17N (d). Antibodies used were
rabbit anti-Par3 (Macara lab12), mouse anti-Myc (1:1000, McGill hybridoma facility),
rabbit anti-HA (1:1000, McGill hybridoma facility), rabbit anti-pJNK (pThr183/Tyr185,
1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-a-tubulin as a loading control (1:5000,
Sigma). (e) NICD/shLuc and NICD/shPar3 mammary tumor sections were stained for
phospho-JNK (1:100). (f) Quantification of cells with nuclear phospho-JNK from (e). Two
regions from each of 3 tumors were analyzed for each. p-values were calculated using the
ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc test (b) or student’s t-test (f). Error bars represent sd (e)
or sem (f). Scale bars = 1mm (a) and 20μm (e).

Figure 4. Rac1/JNK signaling regulates mammary epithelial proliferation

Author Manuscript

(a) Quantification of tumorsphere sizes of MECs expressing GFP (control), wild-type
(Rac1WT), dominant negative (Rac1T17N) or constitutively active (Rac1G12V) Rac1. (b)
Mammary epithelial cells were transduced with control (GFP alone), Rac1T17N, or
Rac1G12V lentivirus and then transplanted into a cleared mammary fat pad and allowed to
regrow for 8-weeks. (c) Quantification of the percentage of the fat pad filled from (b), n=4.
(d) Tissue sections of control (GFP), Rac1T17N, and Rac1G12V mammary glands were
immunostained for Ki67. (e) Quantification of cells with nuclear Ki67 from (d). All ducts
from 2 tissue sections for each of 3 glands were measured. (f) Tissue sections of control
(GFP), Rac1T17N, and Rac1G12V mammary glands were stained for phospho-JNK. (g)
Quantification of cells with nuclear phospho-JNK from (f). (h) Model showing that loss of
Par3 in the normal mammary epithelium activates both apoptotic and proliferative
responses. In the presence of an anti-apoptotic factor (i.e. Notch oncogene), the apoptotic
response caused by a loss of Par3 is suppressed and a Tiam1/Rac1/JNK mediated
proliferative response is revealed. p-values were calculated using the ANOVA with Tukey
HSD post-hoc test. Error bars represent sd (a) or sem (c, e, and (g). Scale bars = 2mm (b) or
10 μm (d and f).
