Abstract
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a common soft-tissue sarcoma of childhood in need of more effective therapeutic options. The expression of p53 in RMS is heterogeneous such that some tumors are wild-type whereas
others are p53 mutant. The small molecule CP-31398 modulates both the wild-type and the mutant p53 proteins. Here, we show that CP-31398 blocks the growth of RMS cells that have either wild-type or mutant p53
status. In wild-type A204 cells, CP-31398 increased the expression of p53 and its downstream transcriptional
targets, p21 and mdm2; enhanced the expression of apoptosis-related proteins; and reduced proliferation biomarkers. Flow profiling of CP-31398–treated cells indicated an enhancement in sub-G0 and G1 populations.
CP-31398 inhibited proliferation in a manner associated with co-induction of SOX9 and p21. Apoptosis induced by CP-31398 occurred with translocation of p53 to mitochondria, leading to altered mitochondrial
membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and reactive oxygen species release. In vivo, CP-31398 decreased
the growth of tumor xenografts composed of wild-type or mutant p53 tumor cells, increasing tumor-free host
survival. Our findings indicate that the ability of CP-31398 to modulate wild-type and mutant p53 results in the
inhibition of RMS growth and invasiveness. Cancer Res; 70(16); 6566–76. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue
sarcoma in pediatrics, with an incidence of 4.6 cases per million children (1). Embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS)
RMS, the two major histologic subtypes of RMS, carry distinct
clinical features (2). ERMS tumors are more common among
young children, typically occurring in the head, neck, and genitourinary tract. ERMS tumors are generally more sensitive to
chemotherapy and radiation. In contrast, ARMS tumors are
more common in adolescents, often occurring in the extremities. Patients with ARMS and undifferentiated sarcoma carry
a less favorable prognosis than patients with ERMS tumors (3).
The overall 5-year survival rate for children with RMS is ∼64%
for cases diagnosed from 1985 to 1994 (1, 2). The majority of
RMS tumors occur sporadically, but a subset of tumors develop
in patients with cancer predisposition syndromes such as
Li-Fraumeni (4).

Using multiagent chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, the
outcome for patients with favorable features has steadily improved (3). However, the prognosis for metastatic and relapsed
RMS tumors remains very poor (5). RMS therapies beyond
cytotoxic chemotherapy are desperately needed. During the
last decade, efforts were made to use tumor suppressor p53
as a major target of drug development for blocking the pathogenesis and progression of various cancers (6). It is well known
that p53 is mutated in more than 50% of all human cancers
including RMS (7). In the remaining 50% where p53 is not mutated and remains wild-type, the signaling downstream of p53
is frequently interrupted (8, 9). Wild-type p53 is usually not
accumulated in the cells due to its short half life (<30 minutes).
Therefore, attempts to increase transcriptionally active p53
either by enhancing the stability of wild-type p53 or by reverting mutant p53 to its wild-type conformation with its ability to
block cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis has been
considered as an important approach in cancer treatment. In
this regard, CP-31398, a styrylquinazoline, can restore a wildtype–associated epitope (monoclonal antibody 1620) on the
DNA-binding domain of the mutant p53 protein (10–14). Furthermore, CP-31398 not only restores p53 functions in mutant
p53-expressing cells but can also significantly increase the protein level and promote the activity of wild-type p53 in multiple
human cancer cell lines, leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis
(14). The putative mechanism by which CP-31398 enhances the
protein levels of wild-type p53 includes blockade of ubiquitination and degradation of p53 without interrupting the physical
association between p53 and MDM2 in vivo (14).

CP-31398 Blocks Progression of Rhabdomyosarcoma

In this study, we investigated the chemotherapeutic effects
of CP-31398 in a poorly differentiated RMS cell line, A204,
which carries wild-type p53 (15, 16), and the ERMS cell line
RD, which carries mutant p53. Our results show that CP31398 induces p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
in both A204 and RD cells. CP-31398–induced transcriptional

activation of p53 is evident by the induction of its downstream targets, p21, mdm2, and puma, in both of these cells.
The induction of apoptosis involved the mitochondrial translocation of p53 followed by the release of cytochrome c and
activation of caspase-3. Parenteral administration of CP31398 reduced the growth of xenograft tumors that developed

indicate that CP-31398 can be highly effective in promoting
diminution of the growth and invasiveness of RMS tumors
carrying wild-type or mutant p53.

divided into three groups of 10 mice each. Each mouse from
all three groups received 2 × 106 cells in 200 μL of PBS s.c. in
each flank. Twenty-four hours after the inoculation of cells,
group 1 mice received an i.p. injection of vehicle, whereas
group 2 and group 3 mice received i.p injections of CP31398 (2 mg/mouse) at 12- or 24-hour intervals, respectively,
for 5 consecutive days per week for 1 month. Tumors were
measured by digital calipers and tumor volumes calculated
using the formula volume = length × width × height/2, plotted as a function of days on test.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel
software. The significance between the two test groups was
determined using Student's t test, and P < 0.05 was considered as significant.

Results
Treatment of A204 cells with CP-31398 induces G1 cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis in RMS A204 cells
To characterize the effects of CP-31398 in A204 cells in vitro,
cells were grown in 60-mm plates and treated with 0, 10, 20,
and 40 μg/mL of CP-31398 for 24 hours, and then samples
were analyzed by flow cytometry. We observed a dosedependent increase in apoptosis of A204 cells following
CP-31398 treatment (Fig. 1A–C). This was indicated by an
accumulation of events with light scatter properties consistent with apoptotic cells and debris and a reduction in
events with viable cell light scatter properties (Fig. 1A). This
correlated with an increased percentage of cells stained with
Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI; Fig. 1B). In the viable
cell gate, we observed a dose-dependent accumulation of
cells in the G1 phase (up to 38% more than control) following
exposure to lower concentrations of CP-31398. At the highest
concentration, CP-31398–induced apoptosis occurred in cells
in all phases of the cell cycle equally, as no significant differences in the cell cycle distribution of the remaining viable cells
as compared with control were discernable (Fig. 1C, graph).
CP-31398 induces the expression of p53 and its
downstream target proteins
The induction of the cell cycle G1 block and apoptosis
by CP-31398 was correlated with the results of Western
blot analyses. As shown in Fig. 1D, CP-31398 slightly enhanced p53 levels in A204 cells detectable over a period
of 24 hours, which may be due to the stabilization of
p53 in addition to the enhanced transcription of this protein (6). We further tested its effects on the expression of

p53-dependent downstream target genes p21 and mdm2.
The expression of these proteins was upregulated at 3, 6,
and 12 hours after treatment with CP-31398. It is known
that p21 is required for G1 cell cycle arrest. Next, we assessed the effect of CP-31398 on the expression of proapoptotic and other cell cycle regulatory proteins in these
cells. A time- and dose-dependent (data not shown) increase in proapoptotic proteins such as Apaf1, Bax, Bcl2,
Bad, and caspase-3 was observed. Consistently, poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage was also induced.
CHK1/2 and Cdc2 levels were increased, whereas cyclin
E expression was decreased. Accumulation of p53 and induction of p21, mdm2, and CHK1/2 proteins were detected
and often peaked at the earliest time points of 3 to 6 hours,
whereas increased levels of the apoptotic pathway proteins
caspase-3, Bad and Puma and PARP cleavage peaked at
12 hours. The enhanced CHK1/2 expression may, in part,
be due to the induction of the DNA damage–dependent
ATM/ATR–regulated signaling pathway. However, this
needs to be investigated in further detail, which is beyond
the scope of this article. Overall, these results are consistent with CP-31398–mediated stabilization of wild-type p53
protein conformation and activation of p53 downstream
functions that block cell cycle and apoptosis in RMS
A204 cells.
CP-31398 induces mitochondrial translocation of
mutant p53, resulting in cytochrome c release
and apoptosis
Next, we investigated whether CP-31398 can enhance
translocation of p53 to mitochondria. It is known that
wild-type p53 migrates to mitochondria in response to genotoxic insult (17) and alters mitochondrial membrane potential (MP; ref. 11). This leads to the release of cytochrome c
from mitochondria to cytoplasm followed by apoptosis induction. In this experiment, we used MitoTracker red dye
to stain mitochondria of vehicle- or CP-31398–treated A204
cells. The localization of p53 in mitochondria (stained in
green) was confirmed by the orange to yellow color in the
overlay. Thus, CP-31398 enhanced p53 mitochondrial localization (Fig. 2A) whereas no such effect was discernible in
vehicle-treated control cells at 15 minutes.
CsA blocks CP-31398–mediated mitochondrial
localization of p53 and consequent induction
of apoptosis in A204 cells
CsA is known to be a potent and specific inhibitor of mitochondrial membrane permeability pore transition (MPT;
refs. 18, 19). We used this agent to determine whether MPT

blockade in A204 cells inhibits CP-31398–mediated p53 mitochondrial translocation and the associated alterations such
as cytochrome c release and induction of apoptosis. As
shown in Fig. 2B, CsA pretreatment blocked mitochondrial
translocation of p53. Concomitantly, mitochondrial cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm was also diminished
(Fig. 2C). In addition, CP-31398–mediated apoptosis was
abrogated.
CP-31398 alters mitochondrial membrane potential
To confirm that CP-31398 alters MP, we used JC-1 dye,
which accumulates in mitochondria and forms aggregates
that emit red-orange fluorescence when exposed to light at
590 nm. Formation of these aggregates requires normal
MP. With altered MP following the membrane depolarization, the dye remains as a monomer in the cytoplasm and
shows green fluorescence (20, 21). The ratio of red/green
fluorescence is a function of MP. CP-31398 decreased
dose-dependently the MP in A204 cells (Fig. 2D). However,
as expected, CsA pretreatment blocked changes in CP31398–induced MP.

day 30), these differences became less significant. As compared
with the vehicle-treated controls, the histology of tumors in
the CP-31398 treatment groups showed less mitotic figures
(Fig. 4B) and large necrotic areas. In addition, we observed remarkably decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)
and cyclin E staining with a dramatic increase in the number
of TUNEL-positive cells. We also found a concomitant reduction in Bcl2 expression in tumors excised from the CP-31398–
treated groups (Fig. 4C).
CP-31398 treatment augments mesenchymal-epithelial
transition in A204 xenograft tumors
To confirm whether CP-31398 alters the invasive growth of
these tumors, we investigated its effects on the expression of
mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) pathway–related
proteins (24) in A204 xenograft tumors using immunofluorescence assay. In CP-31398–treated tumors, the expression of
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/MMP-9, snail, slug, and
twist was found to be reduced (Fig. 4D). Parallel to these observations, we noticed a concomitant decrease in the expression of fibronectin with an increase in E-cadherin expression
(Fig. 4C).

CP-31398 triggers ROS generation, which mediates
apoptosis in A204 cells
ROS are considered to play an important role in apoptosis
in various cell types (22, 23). To investigate whether CP-31398
stimulated ROS generation in A204 cells, we measured intracellular ROS levels using a ROS-detecting fluorescence dye,
DCF-DA. Generation of ROS was evidenced by the increased
intensity of DCF fluorescence. Following treatment of A204
cells with CP-31398, an increased generation of ROS could
be observed at 12 and 24 hours. The percentage of DCFpositive cells was 1.5%, 36.4%, and 52.3% at 0, 12, and
24 hours, respectively (Fig. 3A). However, the ROS scavenger
NAC (5 mmol/L) markedly decreased the level of ROS to ∼6%
at 24 hours. Furthermore, the enhanced ROS production was
significantly reduced by pretreating cells with CsA (Fig. 3B),
suggesting that the major source of CP-31398–mediated ROS
may be the mitochondria.

CP-31398 treatment induces SOX9 expression in
xenograft tumors developed by A204 cells in nude mice
CP-31398 induced the expression of SOX9 in xenograft
tumors, which does not consistently colocalize with TUNELpositive cells (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that SOX9 does
not target the cells destined to die. However, the observed increase of SOX9 and p21 expression in CP-31398–treated A204
xenograft tumors (Fig. 5B) indicates their role in the blockade
of tumor growth because these tumors are significantly smaller
in size compared with vehicle-treated controls. These results
are also supported by Western blot analysis of CP-31398–treated A204 cells showing an identical pattern of SOX9 and p21
induction kinetics (Fig. 5C). This is consistent with previous
reports where SOX9 was shown to bind with the promoters
of p21 and induce its expression, thereby reducing tumor
growth (25).

CP-31398 reduces the growth of xenograft tumors
developed by A204 RMS cells in nude mice
To investigate whether CP-31398 affects the growth of
A204 RMS xenograft tumors in nude mice, we injected CP31398 i.p. (2 mg/mouse daily or twice daily, every 12 hours)
to nude mice over a period of 4 weeks after inoculating them
with A204 cells. Tumor volume was measured every other
day. Animals were sacrificed after 4 weeks of treatment.
We found that tumor growth in the CP-31398 treatment
groups was reduced significantly in a dose-dependent manner
as compared with the vehicle-treated control group as shown
in Fig. 4A. The tumor volume in the control group was 277 ±
47 mm3, whereas it was reduced to 127 ± 41 mm3 in the CP31398 daily treatment group and to 68 ± 24 mm3 in the CP31398 twice-daily treatment group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01,
respectively). At early time points (day 14 and day 18), the differences between the two doses of CP-31398 were found to be
significant (P < 0.05), but at later time points (day 22 and

CP-31398 reduces the growth of xenograft tumors
developed by RD RMS cells in nude mice
To determine whether CP-31398 affects the growth of mutant p53–expressing RMS, we examined the growth of RD
RMS xenograft tumors in nude mice. We administered CP31398 i.p. (2 mg/mouse daily or twice daily, every 12 hours)
over a period of 11 weeks after inoculating these animals
with RD cells (injected s.c. into right and left flanks). Tumor
volume was measured every 5 days. Animals were sacrificed
after 11 weeks of treatment. We observed that tumor growth
in the CP-31398 treatment groups was reduced significantly
(P < 0.05) as compared with the vehicle-treated control group
in a dose-dependent manner, as shown in Fig. 6A. The tumor
volume in the control group was found to be 778 ± 180 mm3,
whereas it was reduced to 389 ± 99 mm3 in the CP-31398
once-daily treatment group and to 240 ± 109 mm3 in the
CP-31398 twice-daily treatment group. At day 70, the differences between these two doses of CP-31398 were significant

(P = 0.0369), but at the termination of experiment, these differences were no longer statistically significant. As compared
with the vehicle-treated controls, the histology of tumors in
CP-31398 treatment groups showed a larger area of necrosis.
The tumor cells manifested less mitotic figures and a
remarkable decrease in staining of the proliferation biomarkers PCNA and cyclin E (Fig. 6B). The CP-31398–treated tumors also showed a substantially increased number of
TUNEL-positive cells. To show that these effects of CP31398 are specifically dependent on p53, we treated RD cells
with various concentrations of CP-31398 and assessed the
levels of p53 and its downstream transcription target genes,
p21, mdm2, and Apaf1. We observed that CP-31398 treatment
stabilizes the levels of p53 and enhances the expression of
p21, mdm2, and Apaf1 (Fig. 6C). In addition, consistent with
immunohistochemistry and TUNEL data in xenograft tumors, CP-31398 treatment reduces the expression of cyclin
E and enhances PARP cleavage.

Discussion
p53 is known to be a potent tumor suppressor and functions as a tetrameric transcription factor by binding to spe-

cific DNA sequences and transactivating or repressing a large
number of target genes involved in cell cycle regulation and
apoptosis (26). Therefore, it is considered to be an important
drug target for blocking cancer growth. In tumors carrying
mutant p53, use of small molecules such as PRIMA-1,
capable of refolding mutant p53 to its wild-type conformation, may be effective in tumor regression (27, 28). In tumors
where p53 is not mutated, agents such as Nutlins have been
shown to be effective in blocking tumor progression (29). By
disrupting mdm2 binding to p53, Nutlins enhance the levels
of p53 protein in tumors carrying wild-type p53 (30). Mdm2
is a ubiquitin ligase that degrades wild-type p53 by its polyubiquitination (31). In this study, we used CP-31398, a chemical agent that has both an ability to revoke wild-type
functions of mutant p53 and a potential to induce wild-type
p53 (32, 33). Earlier, we showed that CP-31398 is highly efficacious against the induction of skin cancer carrying mutant
p53 (11). Because the expression of p53 in RMS is heterogeneous, we investigated the chemotherapeutic effects of CP31398 on the growth of human xenograft tumors developed
by A204 cells carrying wild-type p53 as well as tumors developed by RD cells carrying mutant p53 (homozygous 742 C>T;
R248W missense mutation; ref. 34).

It is known that increase in wild-type p53 induces proteins
that block cell cycle progression and subsequently induce apoptosis (35, 36). Consistent with previous observations, we
observed increased p53 levels and the induction of downstream transcriptional target genes of p53, such as p21,
mdm2, puma, etc., in CP-31398–treated A204 and RD cells.
This is further confirmed by the observed cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in RMS cells that manifest augmented PARP
cleavage, reduced Bcl2, and enhanced Bax expression. The
effects may be due to the stabilization of p53 and enhanced
transcriptional activity of p53. Similarly in CP-31398–treated
nude mice, we observed smaller tumors that showed enhanced numbers of TUNEL-positive cells and reduced expression of Bcl2. These results suggest that these p53-dependent
effects of CP-31398 on cells in culture and in xenograft tumors
are almost identical (37, 38). Interestingly, we also observed
enhanced tumor-free survival of these animals, suggesting
the potential of CP-31398 in the treatment of RMS.

To probe the molecular mechanism by which CP-31398 invokes apoptosis in A204 cells, we investigated its effects on
the migration of p53 to the mitochondria. It is known that
wild-type p53 migrates to mitochondria where it disrupts
permeability pore potential and activates mitochondriaregulated intrinsic apoptotic pathways characterized by the
release of mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm (39).
Our observation that CP-31398 treatment induces mitochondrial localization of p53 in A204 cells suggests mitochondriaregulated apoptosis as the underlying mechanism in the
therapeutic response of CP-31398. This was verified using
CsA, a potent blocker of mitochondrial membrane pore transition. CsA blocked CP-31398–mediated p53 mitochondrial
localization, alterations in MPT, and apoptosis induction in
these cells. Similar results were obtained for RD cells. The
involvement of mitochondria in CP-31398–mediated killing
of RMS cells was further confirmed by observations in this
study that CP-31398 treatment enhances ROS production;

Figure 6. CP-31398 treatment reduces the growth of xenograft tumors developed by RD cells carrying mutant p53 in nude mice. A, CP-31398 reduces
the volume of xenograft tumors (P < 0.05). D1 represents CP-31398 daily treatments at 24-h intervals, whereas D2 represents twice-daily treatments at
12-h intervals. B, histology of tumors developed in vehicle- or CP-31398–treated mice. Insets show mitotic figures (red arrows) and apoptosis (green
arrows). Immunohistochemical and TUNEL staining showing that CP-31398–treatment reduces proliferation as assessed by PCNA and cyclin E expression
(arrow indicates positive nuclear staining) and induces apoptosis (as assessed by an increase in TUNEL-positive cells) in xenograft tumors. C, Western
blot analysis showing that CP-31398 induces stabilization of p53 and enhances the expression of its downstream target genes. In addition, it induces
apoptosis-related genes and reduces the expression of proliferation marker proteins. Mice were treated over 11 wk, starting at the time of tumor inoculation.
Each value represents the mean ± SE of five mice.

CP-31398 Blocks Progression of Rhabdomyosarcoma

that NAC, a cell-permeable antioxidant, affords protection
against CP-31398–mediated cell death; and that NAC and
CsA manifest similar protective effects in CP-31398–treated
A204 cells. These data suggest the possibility that CP-31398
may induce ROS production through mitochondrial membrane disruption and that ROS play a crucial role in the
induction of CP-31398–mediated apoptosis.
p53 is known to play a role in altering the expression of
proteins that regulate the balance between epithelial and
mesenchymal phenotypes and thus determine the invasiveness and metastatic potential of cancer cells (40). It is known
that wild-type p53 suppresses cancer cell invasion by inducing MDM2-mediated slug degradation (41). Slug is a member
of the Snail family of transcription repressors and is capable
of repressing E-cadherin expression thereby triggering EMT
(42). The observations in this study that CP-31398 reduces
the expression of mesenchymal markers such as fibronectin,
slug, snai, and twist with a concomitant decrease in the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes, MMP-2/MMP-9, and
an increase in E-cadherin suggest that CP-31398–mediated
wild-type p53 induction dampens the invasiveness of A204
xenograft tumors and acts by altering the MET. This is confirmed by the observed decrease in the expression of proliferation biomarkers PCNA and cyclin E in these tumors. The
mechanism(s) by which CP-31398 may reduce proliferation
of RMS cells remains largely undefined. Recently, it has been
shown that SOX9 overexpression downregulates melanoma
cell proliferation through direct and indirect stimulation of
the p21 promoter (25). However, our observation that SOX9

and p21 are coexpressed and that SOX9 induction does not
occur in cells undergoing apoptosis is consistent with a novel
mechanism by which CP-31398 may inhibit proliferation in
wild-type p53–positive RMS cells. A similar efficacy of CP31398 in abrogating the growth of xenograft RMS tumors
developed in nude mice by inoculating A204 or RD cells suggests that restoring wild-type functions of mutant p53 is
equally efficacious in tumor regression as activating wildtype p53. Together, these data suggest that CP-31398 has potential to block the growth of human RMS irrespective of the
mutational status of p53. In summary, our data indicate that
small molecular weight compounds such as CP-31398 can be
highly effective in diminishing the growth and invasiveness of
RMS tumors and in enhancing tumor-free survival.
