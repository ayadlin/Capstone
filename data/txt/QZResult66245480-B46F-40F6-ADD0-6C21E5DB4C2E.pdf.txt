Abstract
Recent investigations have documented that constitutively
activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is a common feature
of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), where it
strongly influences growth and survival. These findings lend
compelling weight for the application of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
inhibitors in T-ALL. However, our knowledge of PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling in T-ALL is limited and it is not clear whether
it could be an effective target for innovative therapeutic
strategies. Here, we have analyzed the therapeutic potential
of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103, a small synthetic
molecule of the pyridofuropyrimidine class, on both T-ALL cell
lines and patient samples, which displayed constitutive
activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. PI-103 inhibited the
growth of T-ALL cells, including 170-kDa P-glycoprotein
overexpressing cells. PI-103 cytotoxicity was independent of
p53 gene status. PI-103 was more potent than inhibitors
that are selective only for PI3K (Wortmannin, LY294002) or for
mTOR (rapamycin). PI-103 induced G0-G1 phase cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis, which was characterized by activation
of caspase-3 and caspase-9. PI-103 caused Akt dephosphorylation, accompanied by dephosphorylation of the Akt downstream target, glycogen synthase kinase-3B. Also, mTOR
downstream targets were dephosphorylated in response to
PI-103, including p70S6 kinase, ribosomal S6 protein, and
4E-BP1. PI-103 strongly synergized with vincristine. These
findings indicate that multitargeted therapy toward PI3K and
mTOR alone or with existing drugs may serve as an efficient
treatment toward T-ALL cells, which require up-regulation
of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling for their survival and growth.

Introduction
Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway plays a central role in cancer biology, conferring
resistance both in vivo and in vitro to therapeutic treatments of
various types of malignancies that include leukemias (1–3). Upon
activation, PI3K generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate,

which then activates a number of downstream targets, including
Akt. A fundamental negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway is
the lipid phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin deleted on
chromosome 10), which removes the 3-phosphate from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate, thus down-modulating PI3K/Akt
signaling (2, 3). A PI3K/Akt downstream target that plays an
important role in tumorigenesis and drug resistance is mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR; ref. 4). mTOR phosphorylates p70
ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4Ebinding protein 1 (4E-BP1). By doing so, mTOR increases synthesis
of proteins that are important for cell cycle regulation. T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive neoplastic
disorder of lymphoblasts committed to the T-cell lineage (5). Over
the past 20 years, survival rates of T-ALL patients have improved,
due to advances in therapeutic protocols (6). Survival rates at 5
years for children and adolescents with T-ALL are 70% to 75%,
whereas for adults, they are 35% to 40% (7). Nevertheless, novel
therapies aimed at improperly activated signaling pathways are
needed to combat induction failure, relapse rate, and the
development of drug-resistance in T-ALL patients (7). Aberrant
Notch-1 receptor signaling is a hallmark of T-ALL (8). Fifty-percent
of T-ALL patients display Notch-1 activating mutations (7). As a
consequence, the receptor is activated independently of the ligand
(9). Other Notch-1 mutations impair its degradation and result in a
longer receptor half-life (9, 10). When the intracellular portion of
Notch-1 is released through cleavage mediated by g-secretase
(GSI), it translocates to the nucleus where it affects gene expression
(11). Therefore, GSI inhibition could be exploited to abrogate
aberrant Notch-1 signaling in T-ALL. However, the results of the
first clinical trial testing the GSI inhibitor, MK-0752, in relapsed/
refractory T-ALL patients, showed no clinical responses and a high
incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity (9). Recently, it was shown
that in T-ALL, activated Notch-1 leads to PI3K/Akt signaling upregulation by hairy and enhancer of split 1–mediated transcriptional repression of PTEN (12). Other reports have highlighted that
PTEN posttranslational inactivation through phosphorylation and
oxidation could result in PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation in T-ALL (13).
These findings lend compelling weight for the application of PI3K/
Akt/mTOR inhibitors in T-ALL (14). mTOR inhibitors are being
evaluated for treatment of several types of tumors, including
leukemias (15). Rapamycin or its analogues, used alone or in
combination with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, have shown
some promising effects in preclinical models of T-ALL (e.g., ref. 14).
However, mTOR inhibitors are mainly cytostatic (16) and could
hyperactivate Akt due to the existence of feedback loops between
mTOR, PI3K, and Akt (17). Recently, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
have been synthesized, including PI-103, a small molecule of the

pyridofuropyrimidine class (18). Because PI-103 targets class IA
PI3K in addition to mTOR, it should not lead to Akt activation,
which is seen when only mTOR is targeted by inhibitors (18).
Moreover, PI-103 should affect mTOR signaling also when it is
activated independently from PI3K/Akt, as described in some
T-ALL cases (19). Here, we have analyzed the therapeutic potential
of PI-103 on both T-ALL cell lines and patient samples. We have
shown that this drug displays strong cytotoxic activity against
T-ALL cells.

Materials and Methods
Materials. PI-103 was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. Rapamycin,
LY294002, and Wortmannin were from Sigma-Aldrich. P110a PI3K inhibitor
[compound 15e or (3-[4-(4-Morpholinyl)thieno(3,2-d)pyrimidin-2-yl]-phenol)] was from Alexis, whereas p110h (TGX-221) and p110g (5-[2,2-Difluorobenzo(1,3)dioxol-5-ylmethylene]-thiazolidine-2,4-dione) PI3K inhibitors and
Akt 1/2 inhibitor were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. For Western blots,
the following primary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology:
h-actin, Akt, Ser 473 p-Akt (which recognizes both Akt1 and Akt2 when
phosphorylated on Ser 473 and Ser 474, respectively), p70S6K, Thr 389 pp70S6K, 4E-BP1, Thr 37/46 p-4E-BP1, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3h,
Ser 21/9 p-GSK-3a/h, S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), Ser 235/236 p-S6RP,
p110g PI3K, caspase-3, and caspase-9. Antibodies to p110a, p110h, and
p110y PI3K were from Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore Corporation.
Antibodies to Akt1 (raised in goat) and Akt2 (raised in mouse) were from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Cell culture and patient samples. The T-ALL cell lines Jurkat, MOLT-4,
CEM-S, CEM-R (CEM VBL100, drug-resistant cells overexpressing 170-kDa
P-glycoprotein; ref. 20) were grown in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Patient samples or peripheral blood
lymphocytes from healthy donors were obtained with informed consent
according to institutional guidelines and isolated by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences).
Cell viability analysis. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were performed to assess the sensitivity of cells
to PI-103 and other inhibitors, as previously reported (21).
Annexin V–FITC/propidium iodide staining and cell cycle analysis.
To assess the extent of apoptosis induction after treatments, flow
cytometric analysis of Annexin V–FITC/propidium iodide (PI)-stained
samples was performed, as reported elsewhere (21). Samples were analyzed
by an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). At least 15,000 events
per sample were acquired. For cell cycle analysis, samples were stained with
PI and analyzed by flow cytometry, as described elsewhere (21). At least
10,000 events per sample were acquired.
Western blot analysis. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed
twice in PBS, and lysed as previously reported (21). Samples were separated
on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Western blot analysis was performed as detailed elsewhere
(20). Each blot is representative of three separate experiments. Antibody to
h-actin served as a loading control.
Immunoprecipitation. This was carried out according to others (22).
Cell extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4jC under constant agitation with 5
Ag of the antibody to either Akt1 or Akt2. Ten micrograms of 50% protein
A/G agarose was then added and incubation proceeded for 1 h at 4jC under
constant agitation.
Combined drug effect analysis. The combination effect and a potential
synergy were evaluated from quantitative analysis of dose-effect relationships as described previously (22). For each PI-103/vincristine drug combination experiment, a combination index number was calculated using the
Biosoft CalcuSyn software. This method of analysis generally defines combination index values of 0.9 to 1.1 as additive, 0.3 to 0.9 as synergistic, and
<0.3 as strongly synergistic, whereas values >1.1 are considered antagonistic.
Flow cytometric analysis of p-Akt, p-4E-BP1, and cleaved caspase-3
levels in T-ALL patient samples. Blasts from 7 pediatric patients with
T-ALL were fixed in reagent 1 of the Intraprep kit and permeabilized with

www.aacrjournals.org

saponin-based reagent 2 (Beckman Coulter) as reported elsewhere (23, 24).
Cells were incubated with primary antibody to Ser473 p-Akt, Thr 37/46
p-4E-BP1, or cleaved caspase-3. All the antibodies were from Cell Signaling
and were conjugated to AlexaFluor 488. A rabbit IgG conjugated to
AlexaFluor 488 was used as an irrelevant antibody. Cells were analyzed on a
FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). At least 10,000 events per sample
were acquired.

Results
PI-103 has cytotoxic proapoptotic effects on T-ALL cell lines.
The effect of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 on PTENnegative T-ALL cell lines was examined first. Although Jurkat and
MOLT-4 cells do not express p53, CEM cells display nonfunctional
p53 (data not shown; ref. 25). Moreover, both Jurkat and MOLT-4
cells have aberrant Notch-1 signaling (26). T-ALL cell lines were
treated with different concentrations of PI-103. After 24 and
48 hours, the rates of survival were measured using MTT assays.
Cell lines displayed an IC50 for PI-103 ranging from 0.25 to
1.0 Amol/L at 24 hours and from 0.25 to 0.40 Amol/L at 48 hours.
The vehicle alone (DMSO) did not affect cell survival (data not
shown). Remarkably, also the drug-resistant CEM-R cell line, a
subclone overexpressing 170-kDa P-glycoprotein, showed sensitivity to PI-103 (IC50, 0.6 Amol/L at 24 hours and 0.25 Amol/L at 48
hours; Fig. 1A). Next, a comparison was made between PI-103 and
inhibitors of either mTOR (rapamycin) or PI3K (Wortmannin,
LY294002). Rapamycin was less effective than PI-103 in negatively
affecting cell growth of T-ALL cell lines, also when used at
equimolar concentrations, (Fig. 1B). Wortmannin was much less
effective than PI-103 and the same was true of LY294002, which
approached PI-103 cytotoxicity only when used at 25 to 50 Amol/L
(Fig. 1B).
It was next investigated whether decreased cell proliferation was
related to apoptosis, using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow
cytometry. After 9 hours of treatment, f45% of CEM-R cells were
apoptotic with 25% in early apoptosis (Annexin V-FITC positive
only) and 20% mid/late apoptosis (Annexin V-FITC/PI positive),
whereas f9% of CEM-S cells were positive for early apoptosis
(Annexin V-FITC only) and another 33% were positive for both
Annexin-V and PI, indicating mid/late apoptotic cells. The degree
of apoptosis induced in MOLT-4 and Jurkat cells by PI-103 was
similar to that detected in CEM-S cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Both rapamycin and LY294002 were much less effective than PI-103
in inducing apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Given the
fundamental role played by PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in cell
proliferation, the effects of PI-103 on cell cycle progression were
also investigated. Flow cytometric analysis of PI-stained T-ALL cells
treated with PI-103 for 16 hours documented an increase in G0-G1
phase cells and a decrease in S and G2-M phase cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). As rapamycin is mainly cytostatic, we reasoned
that MTT assay could not be the most appropriate technique to
calculate its IC50. Therefore, we also performed flow cytometric
analysis of cell cycle. However, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2,
this technique also documented that the IC50 was not reached even
at 3 Amol/L rapamycin for CEM-R, CEM-S, and MOLT-4 cells,
whereas for Jurkat cells the decrease in cell proliferation was
around 50% at 3 Amol/L.
Overall, these findings showed that PI-103 potently reduced the
growth of T-ALL cell lines and that this effect was due to both
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
PI-103 induces caspase activation. A distinguishing feature of
apoptotic cell death is the activation of a family of proteases called

caspases, which are responsible for most of the biochemical and
morphologic changes that characterize apoptosis (27). Western
blotting analysis of extracts from both CEM-R and MOLT-4 cells
treated with PI-103 documented that cleavage of procaspase-9 and
procaspase-3 was detectable at 8 hours of treatment. In contrast,
rapamycin activated caspase-3 and caspase-9 only in MOLT-4 cells,
and at a later time (16 h; Fig. 2).
PI-103 affects PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in T-ALL cell lines.
Western blot analysis with an antibody to Ser 473 p-Akt showed a
marked decrease in this p-Akt form in response to 0.75 Amol/L
PI-103 already after 8 hours of treatment (Fig. 3A). Rapamycin
(0.1 Amol/L) treatment transiently activated Ser 473 p-Akt at
8 hours, in agreement with others (28). The p-Akt levels then
decreased, but at 48 hours, they increased again. Total Akt levels
were unaffected by either PI-103 or rapamycin. Akt inhibition by
PI-103 had functional consequences because the well-established
Akt downstream target, GSK3-h, showed a decreased phosphorylation level, whereas the expression of total GSK3-h was unaffected.
p-GSK-3h behavior in response to rapamycin was similar to p-Akt
in that it increased at 8 hours, then decreased and increased again
at 48 hours. mTOR downstream substrates (p70S6K, 4E-BP1,
and S6RP) were efficiently dephosphorylated by both PI-103 and

rapamycin, with the exception of 4E-BP1 that was resistant to
rapamycin (Fig. 3A). A dose-dependent investigation carried on
CEM-R cells showed that PI-103 induced Akt dephosphorylation
already at 125 nmol/L, whereas 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation was
detectable at 250 nmol/L (Fig. 3B).
Characterization of PI3K/Akt signaling in T-ALL cells. No
information is available regarding the class I PI3K catalytic
subunits and Akt isoforms that are active in PTEN-negative
T-ALL cell lines. This issue is relevant to cancer therapy, as Akt
isoform–specific inhibitors are actively sought (29). Moreover, inhibitors selective for class I PI3K catalytic subunits are being tested
in clinical trials (30). Immunoprecipitation experiments were
performed on extracts from T-ALL cells using antibodies specific
for either Akt1 or Akt2. The immunoprecipitates were blotted to
nitrocellulose membranes that were then probed with the antibody
used for the immunoprecipitation, or an antibody that recognizes
both Akt1 or Akt2 when phosphorylated on Ser 473 and Ser 474,
respectively. We found that T-ALL cell lines expressed both Akt1
and Akt2 that were phosphorylated (Fig. 4A). As a control, the blots
with the Akt1 immunoprecipitates were probed with the antibody to Akt2, and vice versa. The antibody to Akt2 picked up some
bands in the Akt1 blots; however, the molecular weight of these

rapamycin (0.1 Amol/L) for the indicated times, collected,
and then lysed. Fifty micrograms of each lysate were

bands did not correspond to Akt1 molecular weight (60 kDa). In
contrast, the antibody to Akt1 did not pick up any bands in the
Akt2 blots (Fig. 4A).
T-ALL cell lines expressed p110a, p110h, p110g, and p110y PI3K,
as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B). We next examined
the effects of p110 PI3K isoform selective inhibitors to establish
which isoforms were involved in T-ALL cell survival (Fig. 4B).
We used compound 15e, which inhibits p110a PI3K with an IC50
of 0.58 Amol/L (31), TGX-221, which displays an IC50 of around
40 nmol/L for p110h PI3K (32), and 5-[2,2-Difluoro-benzo(1,3)dioxol-5-ylmethylene]-thiazolidine-2,4-dione, which has an IC50 of
f250 nmol/L against p110g PI3K (33). MTT assays were performed
after 24 hours of treatment. A dose-dependent decrease in cell

survival was obtained with the p110a PI3K selective inhibitor.
In contrast, inhibitors of h and g p110 PI3K had either much lower
(h) or no (g) effects (Fig. 4B). No effects were observed with a p110
y PI3K-selective inhibitor (data not shown; ref. 32). Consistently,
inhibition of Ser 473 p-Akt phosphorylation was maximally
observed with the a inhibitor, and to a much lower extent with
h inhibitor, whereas the g inhibitor actually increased Akt phosphorylation when used at 2 Amol/L (Fig. 4C). The p110y PI3K
inhibitor was ineffective in dephosphorylating Akt (data not
shown). Immunoprecipitation experiments documented that the
p110a PI3K inhibitor dephosphorylated both Akt1 and Akt2 in
Jurkat cells. Also, PI-103 dephosphorylated both Akt isoforms
(Fig. 4D). However, when the p110a PI3K selective inhibitor was

as documented by Western blots. MTT assays of T-ALL cell lines, performed after 24 h of treatment, showed that only a p110a PI3K inhibitor (compound 15e)

combined with rapamycin, the growth inhibition effect was not
as strong as with PI-103. An allosteric Akt 1/2 inhibitor (34) was
less effective than PI-103, when used at equimolar concentrations
(Supplementary Fig. S3A–B). Also, this inhibitor was much less
cytotoxic than PI-103 when used against CEM-R cells. Overall, these
experiments showed that T-ALL cell lines display both p-Akt1 and
p-Akt2 expression and that p110a PI3K is the most important
isoform for their growth.
PI-103 synergizes with vincristine. It was investigated whether
PI-103 could synergize with vincristine, a drug commonly used for
treating T-ALL patients (35). Previous reports have indicated that
mTOR activation specifically confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs that target the microtubules, including vincristine
(36). T-ALL cell lines were incubated for 24 hours with vincristine
alone, PI-103 alone, or the drugs together at a fixed ratio (PI-103/
vincristine, 25:1). MTT assays were then performed. The combined

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (8). April 15, 2009

treatment was much more cytotoxic than either of the two drugs
alone (Fig. 5A). Analysis of the combination index documented the
existence of a strong synergism (combination index, <0.3) at PI-103
concentrations that were well below the IC50 (Fig. 5B).
T-ALL blasts are sensitive to PI-103. To better assess the
effectiveness of PI-103 as a potential therapeutic agent in T-ALL,
we examined pediatric T-ALL patient samples isolated from bone
marrow or peripheral blood, for the levels of Ser 473 p-Akt, and Thr
37/46 p-4E-BP1, as well as for their sensitivity to PI-103, using flow
cytometry and MTT assays. The clinical features of T-ALL patients
are presented in Supplementary Table S1. All patient samples
(7 of 7) had higher levels of p-Akt and p-4E-BP1 than those
detected in peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors
(data not shown; Fig. 6A). Flow cytometric analysis documented a
decrease in the levels of Ser 473 p-Akt in samples treated with
PI-103 (Fig. 6B). The same technique also showed increased levels

of cleaved caspase-3 after treatment with PI-103, which were higher
than in samples exposed to rapamycin (Fig. 6C). To determine
the susceptibility of T-ALL lymphoblasts to inhibition of PI3K/
Akt/mTOR signaling, the samples were treated with increasing concentrations of PI-103 for 96 hours, and cell survival was analyzed
by MTT assays. A strong reduction of cell viability at 96 hours
was detected. The IC50 for patient samples ranged between 0.18
and 0.63 Amol/L PI-103. Overall, these findings showed that PI-103
has a potent cytotoxic activity and activated caspase-3 also in
primary cells from T-ALL patients with up-regulated PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling.

Discussion
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a recently identified potential
target for therapeutic intervention in T-ALL. Here, we have shown
that PI-103 has a strong cytotoxic activity against T-ALL cell lines
and lymphoblasts derived from T-ALL patients. Thus far, the
antiproliferative effects of PI-103 have been mainly documented
in glioblastomas (18) and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells
(37, 38). PI-103 cytotoxicity in T-ALL cell lines was independent of
the p53 gene status. It should be emphasized that p53 mutations
are associated with a much worse prognosis in T-ALL patients (39).
Our findings are different to those reported for AML cell lines,
where the modest cytotoxic effect of PI-103 could be enhanced
by the murine double minute-2 inhibitor, Nutlin-3, in a wild-type
p53-dependent fashion (38). In this respect, our results are in
agreement with those reported for glioblastoma cell lines, where
PI-103 was cytototoxic independently of the p53 gene status (18).
Moreover, PI-103 was effective also against a CEM cell subclone,
CEM-R, which overexpresses high levels of 170-kDa P-glycoprotein,
one of the main determinants of drug resistance. This observation is relevant, as 170 kDa P-glycoprotein is detected in f24% of
T-ALL patients and negatively correlates with the achievement of a
complete remission (40, 41). In T-ALL cell lines, PI-103 induced
both G0-G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which was characterized by activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. In contrast, in
AML cell lines, PI-103 was mainly cytostatic and did not induce
apoptosis or only had a modest apoptogenic activity (37, 38). PI-103
was capable of dephosphorylating Akt and its downstream target,
GSK-3h, as well as mTOR downstream targets. PI-103 strongly
synergized with vincristine, a drug used in treating T-ALL patients.
Remarkably, PI-103 displayed cytotoxic activity against lymphoblasts from patients with pediatric T-ALL characterized by enhanced levels of p-Akt and p-4E-BP1. Also, in patient samples,
PI-103 dephosphorylated Akt and activated caspase-3.
In our hands, PI-103 was more effective than rapamycin alone
in negatively affecting growth of T-ALL cells, even when used on an
equimolar basis. PI-103 was also more effective than Wortmannin,
an irreversible PI3K inhibitor. LY294002, a reversible PI3K inhibitor,
displayed a potency that approached that of PI-103 only when used
at extremely high concentrations.
Because rapamycin and its analogues only target mTORC1 and
not mTORC2 (which is responsible for Ser 473 p-Akt phosphorylation; ref. 17), it has been shown that the use of these inhibitors
could indeed result in Akt hyperactivation (28). Consistently,
we have observed that rapamycin treatment of T-ALL cell lines
resulted in Akt hyperactivation at 8 and 48 hours. Also the Akt
substrate GSK-3h displayed hyperphosphorylation at the same
times, implying an activation of Akt by rapamycin. In contrast,
PI-103, which has been documented to inhibit both mTORC1

Figure 6. PI-103 is cytotoxic to primary lymphoblasts from pediatric patients (Pt ) with T-ALL, displaying constitutive phosphorylation of Akt and 4E-BP1 and
inducing caspase-3 activation. A, samples from T-ALL patients were analyzed by flow cytometry for the levels of Ser 473 p-Akt and Thr 37/46 p-4E-BP1. Four
representative patients are shown. Black histograms, negative control (irrelevant antibody); gray histograms, cells positive for the specific antibody. B, patient samples
were analyzed by flow cytometry for the levels of Ser 473 p-Akt before and after treatment with PI-103 (0.5 Amol/L for 72 h). Black histograms, negative control
(irrelevant antibody); gray histograms, cells positive for the specific antibody; CTRL , control cells. C, patient samples were treated with 0.1 Amol/L rapamycin or
0.5 Amol/L PI-103 or DMSO for 72 h, then analyzed by flow cytometry for cleaved caspase-3. Black histograms, DMSO-treated samples; gray histograms, drug-treated
samples. D, MTT assay of T-ALL blasts treated with PI-103 for 96 h. Points, mean of at least two different experiments; bars, SD; *, statistically significant

and mTORC2 activity (18), did not hyperactivate Akt in T-ALL
cells, even at later incubation times, and this might be related
to mTORC2 inhibition. A previous report highlighted that in Jurkat
cells, prolonged treatment with rapamycin inhibited mTORC2
at 24 hours (42). However, that study did not examine later
times. At present, we do not know if the hyperphosphorylation
of Akt we observed after 48 hours of treatment with rapamycin
was due to a low stability of the drug in vitro or to other reason(s). Interestingly, PI-103, but not rapamycin, dephosphorylated
4E-BP1. This might be due to the fact that, in T-ALL cells, 4E-BP1

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (8). April 15, 2009

is downstream of PIM kinases and not of mTORC1. This would
not be unprecedented, as it has been recently shown to occur
in AML cells (43). Therefore, we could hypothesize that PI-103,
by blocking PI3K/Akt, would result also in PIM kinase downregulation, as PIM kinases have been reported to be downstream
of PI3K/Akt (44). Lack of 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation by rapamycin
could also explain why the drug is less efficacious than PI-103
against T-ALL cell lines.
We also have shown for the first time that T-ALL cell lines
express Akt1 and Akt2. Both of these isoforms were constitutively

phosphorylated, and PI-103 down-regulated their phosphorylation
levels. Another new finding emerging from our study is that in
T-ALL cell lines, p110a PI3K, seems to be the most important
isoform for cell growth and Akt1/Akt2 phosphorylation. PI-103 was
originally described as a compound specifically targeting p110a
PI3K (18), although subsequent investigations have highlighted that
it also inhibited other class IA PI3Ks (37). However, a combination
of rapamycin plus the p110a PI3K inhibitor, 15e, was less effective
than PI-103. Also, an Akt1/Akt2 allosteric inhibitor was less
effective than PI-103.
In conclusion, we have provided evidence that PI-103, either
alone or in combination with vincristine, is a highly effective drug
against T-ALL cells, also derived from patients. It displayed cytotoxic activity against cells with activating Notch-1 mutations, such
as Jurkat and MOLT-4, which are resistant to GSI (26).
PI-103 has proven efficacy also in vivo against models of human
tumors xenografted in mice, where it displayed low toxicity and
was well-tolerated (18, 28). Interestingly, in a mouse model of
Bcr-Abl+ B-ALL, PI-103 was less effective than rapamycin (45). This
could reflect important biological differences between T-ALL and
Bcr-Abl+ B-ALL, which, however, remain to be elucidated. In any
case, hypersensitivity of Bcr-Abl+ B-ALL cell lines to rapamycin has
been recently reported also by another group (46).
PI-103 did not induce apoptosis in normal human CD34+ cells
and had moderate effects on their clonogenicity and proliferation (37). This could indicate that dual targeting of PI3K/mTOR

signaling would not detrimentally affect normal hematopoiesis
in humans.
PI-103 did not enter clinical trials mainly because of its rapid
in vivo metabolism (47). Nevertheless, we feel that our findings
strongly support the hypothesis that longitudinal inhibition at two
nodes of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in T-ALL cells could ensue
in more effective results than the use of a single inhibitor targeting
either PI3K or mTOR.
Recently, a new orally available dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, NVPBEZ235, has entered phase I clinical trials (48). It will be interesting to test if NVP-BEZ235 is as effective as PI-103 against T-ALL
cells. These investigations could pave the way for using dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors to improve the therapeutic outcome of T-ALL
patients displaying activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.
