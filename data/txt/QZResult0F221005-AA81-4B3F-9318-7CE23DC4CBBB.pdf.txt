Abstract
Normal epithelial cells undergo apoptosis upon detachment
from the extracellular matrix, a process termed ‘‘anoikis.’’
However, malignant epithelial cells with metastatic potential
resist anoikis and can survive in an anchorage-independent
fashion. Molecules that sensitize resistant cells to anoikis will
be useful chemical probes to understand this pathway. To
identify novel anoikis sensitizers in anoikis-resistant PPC-1
prostate adenocarcinoma cells, a library of 2,000 off-patent
drugs and natural products was screened for their ability to
preferentially induce cell death in suspension over adherent
culture conditions. This screen identified five members of the
family of cardiac glycosides as anoikis sensitizers, including
ouabain, peruvoside, digoxin, digitoxin, and strophanthidin.
We conducted further studies with ouabain to discern the
mechanism of cardiac glycoside-induced anoikis sensitization. Ouabain initiated anoikis through the mitochondrial
pathway of caspase activation. In addition, ouabain sensitized cells to anoikis by inhibiting its known target, the
Na+/K+ ATPase pump, and inducing hypoosmotic stress.
Resistance to anoikis permits cancer cells to survive in the
circulation and facilitates their metastasis to distant organs,
so we tested the effects of Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition on
distant tumor formation in mouse models. In these mouse
models, ouabain inhibited tumor metastases but did not
alter the growth of subcutaneous tumors. Thus, we have
identified a novel mechanism to sensitize resistant cells to
anoikis and decrease tumor metastasis. These results suggest
a potential mechanism for the observed clinical reduction in
metastasis and relapse in breast cancer patients who have
undergone treatments with cardiac glycosides. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Apoptosis that results from the loss of cell-matrix interaction is
termed anoikis and has been suggested to act as a physiologic

barrier to metastasis (1–4). Anoikis resistance allows for matrixindependent survival of metastatic cancer cells (5). In addition,
anoikis resistance permits malignant cells to survive in a loosely
suspended state as they travel through the circulatory and
lymphatic systems tumbling and mildly adhering to the vessel
walls until they implant in a distant site (6, 7). Thus, molecules that
sensitize resistant cells to anoikis could serve as useful probes to
better understand this pathway and potentially could be leads for
therapeutic adjuncts to control cancer metastasis.
The process of anoikis can involve activation of the death
receptor and/or mitochondrial pathways of caspase activation. For
example, upon detachment, nonmalignant human umbilical
vascular endothelial cells undergo anoikis through a mechanism
dependent on the Fas-associated death domain and activation of
caspase-8 (8). Amplification of the death signal through the
mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation is also required for
anoikis in cell lines such as Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (9).
Previously, we showed that overexpression of the caspase8 inhibitor FLIP confers resistance to anoikis in metastatic cells
(10). Decreasing FLIP with siRNA or our chemical inhibitor 5809354
prevented distant tumor formation in a mouse model (10). To
identify other mechanisms of anoikis resistance, we conducted a
chemical screen for anoikis sensitizers and identified the cardiac
glycoside family of Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors. Subsequent studies
showed that these compounds sensitized resistant cells to anoikis
by inducing hypoosmotic stress and through a pathway related to
disruption of mitochondrial activity. As anoikis resistance is
required for tumor metastasis, we evaluated cardiac glycosides in
mouse models of metastasis and showed that these agents blocked
distant tumor formation.

The Na+/K+ ATPase Pump and Anoikis
were seeded into 96-well polystyrene (adherent) and 96-well ultra–low
binding hydrogel-coated (suspension) tissue culture plates (Corning).
Compounds from the chemical libraries were added in parallel to cells in
adherent and suspension conditions. After 20-h incubation, cell viability was
assessed using the CellTiter 96 AQ One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
(MTS; Promega). Hits were defined empirically as compounds that
preferentially reduced viability under suspension conditions but not
adherent conditions and defined mathematically as (relative viability under
suspension conditions)/(relative viability under adherent conditions) z3
SDs below the mean of the population of compounds tested (12).
Cell viability, cytotoxicity, and caspase assays. The MTS assay was
used as a surrogate to measure cell viability as previously described (13).
Cytotoxicity was assessed using the Multitox-Fluor cytotoxicity assay
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (14). The ratio of the
relative number of dead cells to relative number of viable cells was
calculated and plotted. Caspase activation in intact cells was measured
by flow cytometry using FITC-labeled peptides that bind to caspase-8 or
caspase-9 (Cell Technologies), as previously described (12, 15).
Flow cytometric analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential. To
measure differences in the mitochondrial membrane potential, cells were

stained with 0.75 Ag/mL JC-1 (Sigma). After incubation for 20 min at 37jC,
5% CO2, in the dark, cells were subjected to flow cyotmetric analysis. The
excitation wavelength was 488 nm, and observation wavelengths were
530 nm for green and 585 nm for red fluorescence.
In vivo distant tumor formation. Male severe combined immunodeficient mice (SCID) were obtained from and housed at the Ontario Cancer
Institute animal colony, kept in laminar-flow cage racks under standardized
environmental conditions with access to food and water ad libitum. Distant
tumor formation was assessed using our previously described model
(10–12). A single common threshold was applied to identify and measure
fluorescence in each organ. The number of fluorescent spots and the
corresponding pixel area were recorded for each lung lobe. All quantification was performed on unmanipulated images (10, 12, 16).
Tumor spread and metastasis were also assessed through the BON1
neuroendocrince tumor model. Briefly, NOD/SCID mice were xenografted
with an i.p. injection of 5  106 BON1 cells. Tumor growth was monitored
weekly with MicroCT, and after 4 wk, animals were sacrificed and tumor
weight, invasion, and metastasis were evaluated. All experiments were
performed according to the regulations of the Canadian Council on Animal
Care.

Statistical analysis. For the in vivo studies, nonparametric methods
were used to test for difference in the number of tumors. For comparisons
of two groups, the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was used. For the in vitro
studies, two-sided paired t tests were used to test for significance, where a
P value of <0.05 was considered to be significant.

Results
Identification of small molecules that sensitize resistant
cells to anoikis. Resistance to anoikis allows malignant cancer
cells to survive in the absence of adhesion to the extracellular
matrix, which facilitates metastases. To better understand
the regulation of this pathway, we developed, and conducted a
chemical screen to identify small molecules that could sensitize
resistant cells to anoikis. Cells under suspension or adherent
conditions were treated with aliquots from the Spectrum
(n = 2,000) library of off patent drugs and natural products ( final
concentration 5 Amol/L and <0.2% DMSO). Twenty hours after
incubation, the MTS assay was used as a surrogate to measure
cell viability (Fig. 1A).
Hits were compounds that preferentially induced cell death
under suspension conditions and were empirically defined as
compounds where the relative viability ratio was three SDs below
the mean relative viability ratio of all 2,000 compounds tested. The
top reproducible hits from this screen were the cardiac glycosides

ouabain and peruvoside. Members of this family of Na+/K+ ATPase
inhibitors, namely digoxin and digitoxin, are used to treat
congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Interestingly,
the screen also identified three other cardiac glycosides, as weaker
anoikis sensitizers.
Ouabain sensitizes resistant cells to anoikis. To validate
ouabain and peruvoside as anoikis sensitizers, PPC-1 cells were
treated overnight with increasing concentrations of the compounds under adherent and suspension conditions, and viability
was measured by the MTS assay. Both ouabain and peruvoside
sensitized PPC-1 cells to anoikis with LD50 of 163 F 45 nmol/L and
148 F 46 nmol/L, respectively, under suspension conditions. In
contrast, the LD50 of both compounds under adherent conditions
were >50 Amol/L (Fig. 1B). As ouabain and peruvoside had similar
results, we chose to carry ouabain forward for further analysis.
Increasing the treatment time to 48 hours lowered the LD50 to 24 F
15 nmol/L in suspension conditions (data not shown). Ouabain
sensitized PPC-1 cells to anoikis by the MitoTox assay, which
directly measures the number of viable and dead cells (Fig. 1C). The
spectrum of activity of ouabain as an anoikis sensitizer was
observed in the PC-3, OVCAR3, HeLa, and T47D cell lines (Fig. 1D).
Ouabain sensitizes to anoikis through the inhibition of the
Na+/K+ ATPase pump. Ouabain is a known inhibitor of the Na+/K+
ATPase pump (17). To determine whether the observed anoikis

fluorescently labeled cells. Columns, fold increase in activity; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001 by the Student’s t test. D, PPC-1 cells were seeded

harvested and stained with 0.75 Ag/mL JC-1 and monitored by flow cytometry to quantify the percentage of fluorescently labeled cells. Loss of fluorescent signal
in red channel represents mitochondrial depolarization. A representative experiment is shown.

The Na+/K+ ATPase Pump and Anoikis

sensitization was due to inhibition of this pump, genetic and
chemical approaches were used. As a genetic approach, we stably
overexpressed the murine Na+/K+ ATPase pump (ATP1a1), as this
pump is resistant to inhibition by ouabain (18). Here, PPC-1 cells
stably expressing ATP1a1 or vector control were treated with
increasing concentrations of ouabain under suspension and
adherent conditions for 20 hours. ATP1a1 protected cells against
ouabain-induced anoikis (Fig. 2A), consistent with a mechanism of
action related to the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.
As a chemical approach to determine whether ouabain was
acting through a mechanism related to the inhibition of the Na+/K+
ATPase pump, we tested a panel of known Na+/K+ ATPase
inhibitors for their ability to sensitize PPC-1 cells to anoikis.
Digoxin, digitoxin, digitoxigenin, dihydroouabain, and strophanthidin all sensitized cells to anoikis (Fig. 2B). Thus, taken together,
these results show that the inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump
sensitizes resistant cells to anoikis.
Ouabain sensitization to anoikis involves caspase activation. We and others have reported that anoikis is a caspasedependent process (9, 10, 12, 19–21). To determine whether anoikis
sensitization by ouabain involved the activation of caspases, PPC-1
cells were treated under suspension conditions with increasing
concentrations of ouabain in the presence or absence of the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. z-VAD-fmk inhibited the ability of
ouabain to promote anoikis (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 3A). To
further examine the role of caspases in ouabain-induced anoikis,
we examined the cleavage of PARP, a downstream target of the
effector caspases. PPC-1 cells were treated in suspension
conditions with 100 nmol/L of ouabain. At increasing times after
initiation, cells were harvested and PARP cleavage was measured by
immunoblotting. Ouabain increased the cleavage of PARP in a
time-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, taken
together, these results show that caspase activation plays a role in
ouabain induced anoikis.
Ouabain anoikis sensitization proceeds through the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation. Defects in the death
receptor pathway of caspase activation can render malignant cells
resistant to anoikis, and targeting these defects can restore anoikis
sensitivity (10, 12, 22). To determine whether inhibition of the Na+/
K+ ATPase pump sensitized cells to anoikis by affecting targets in
the death receptor pathway, PPC-1 cells were seeded in adherent
conditions in the presence or absence of the FAS activating
antibody CH-11 (FAS) and treated with increasing concentrations
of ouabain. Despite its ability to sensitize cells to anoikis, ouabain
treatment increased the viability of FAS-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Given these findings, we measured levels of Fas
ligand mRNA expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR
after ouabain treatment because we have previously shown that
Fas ligand expression is increased in suspension conditions (10).
Under both adherent and suspension conditions, ouabain
decreased levels of FAS ligand mRNA in a time-dependent manner
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Taken together, these results suggest
that inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase sensitizes cells to anoikis
through mechanisms independent of the death receptor pathway.
To further assess whether ouabain sensitized cells to anoikis
through mechanisms independent of the death receptor pathway
of caspase activation, PPC-1 cells overexpressing Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, FLIP,
or CrmA were treated with increasing concentrations of ouabain
under suspension conditions. Compared with vector control,
overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL blocked ouabain mediated
sensitization to anoikis, unlike the caspase-8 inhibitors CrmA or

Cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of ouabain for 18 h. After
treatment, cells were collected and cell size was measured by flow cytometry.
Columns, mean fold increase in cell size; bars, SE. *, P < 0.0001 by the

conditions for 24 h. An equivalent number of cells cultured in suspension
conditions were seeded in suspension conditions in media of decreasing
osmolality. Medium of decreasing osmolality was added to the adherent cells at
the same time of seeding of suspension cells. An MTS assay was used to assess
cell viability after 1 h of incubation. Columns, mean percent of viable cells;

FLIP (Fig. 3B). Thus, these results suggest that ouabain is acting by
stimulating the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation. To
test this hypothesis, PPC-1 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L
ouabain or buffer control under suspension conditions. At
increasing times after treatment, activation of caspase 8 and 9
was measured using cell-permeable FITC-labeled peptides that
bind preferentially and irreversibly to active caspases. Active
caspase-9 was detected before the activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 3C).
Given this dependence on the mitochondrial pathway of caspase
activation, we tested whether inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase
pump sensitized cells to anoikis by disrupting the mitochondria.
Here, PPC-1 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L ouabain in
suspension conditions. At increasing times after treatment,
mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by staining cells
with the JC-1 cationic dye and flow cytometry (23). Treatment of
PPC-1 cells with ouabain under suspension conditions induced a
rapid loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 3D). Thus,
taken together, these results indicate that inhibition of the Na+/K+
ATPase pump sensitizes cells to anoikis by activating the
mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.
Ouabain sensitizes cells to anoikis by inducing hypoosmotic
stress. Inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump increases intracellular Na+ (24). Consistent with this effect, cells treated with ouabain
had morphologic evidence of increased cell size (data not shown).
To quantify this effect, PPC-1 cells were treated with increasing

concentrations of ouabain in adherent and suspension conditions,
and cell size was measured by flow cytometry. After 20 hours of
ouabain treatment, cell size was increased in suspension and
adherent conditions when compared with cells treated with buffer
control (data not shown; Fig. 4A). To determine whether the
increased cell size induced by inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase was
associated with anoikis sensitization, PPC-1 cells were treated
under adherent or suspension conditions in media with decreasing
osmolality for 1 hour. Hypoosmotic culture conditions increased
cell size and sensitized cells to anoikis (Fig. 4B). Thus, taken
together, these results suggest that inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase
pump sensitizes cells to anoikis by increasing intracellular volume
and inducing hypoosmotic stress.
Ouabain decreases the in vivo survival of circulating
prostate cancer cells. Resistance to anoikis promotes metastasis
by allowing normally adherent cancer cells to survive after

detachment from the primary tumor site in the circulatory and
lymphatic systems. Since we have shown that inhibition of the
Na+/K+ ATPase pump is able to sensitize resistant PPC-1 cells to
anoikis, we wished to test whether inhibition of this pump would
decrease the in vivo survival of cells in the circulatory system of
mice. PPC-1 cells labeled with dsRed2 red fluorescent protein
(PPC-1 dsRed) were either treated with buffer control or increasing
concentrations of ouabain in adherent conditions for 18 hours.
After treatment, cells were injected i.v. into SCID mice that had
been sublethally irradiated to reduce residual natural killer cell
function (25). Five weeks after injection, mice were sacrificed and
each organ was imaged using fluorescent microscopy. Retention
and growth of the tumor cells were detected in the lung, bone, liver,
and lymph nodes, all of which are clinically relevant sites of
metastases in prostate cancer. Interestingly, i.v. injection of PPC-1
dsRed cells into SCID mice that had not been sublethally irradiated

Figure 6. Systemic administration of ouabain diminishes the in vivo survival and growth of circulating prostate cancer cells. A and B, PPC-1dsRed cells were
injected i.v. through the tail vein of sublethally irradiated SCID mice. One hour before and for 2 wk after the injections, mice were treated i.p. with ouabain in PBS
(0.67 mg/kg/d) or PBS control. The number and area of fluorescent spots in all five lobes of the lungs of the mice were quantified using image analysis software.

developed tumors in the lymph node but not other organ systems
(data not shown). Therefore, the effects of ouabain on distant
tumor formation were assessed in sublethally irradiated SCID mice.
Mice injected with cells treated with ouabain developed fewer
tumors in a dose-dependent manner in these organs when
compared with mice injected with cells treated with buffer control
(Fig. 5A). Because the resolution in the lungs was sufficient for
quantitative image analysis, the total tumor number and tumor
area was calculated. In a dose-dependent manner, significant
reductions in tumor size and number were observed after injecting
mice with cells treated with ouabain compared with controls
(Fig. 5B and C). It is important to note that >94% of both treated
and control cells were viable at the time of injection and remained
viable for an extended period of time under adherent conditions, as
tumor weight was not significantly altered after s.c. injection of
PPC-1 dsRed cells treated with ouabain or buffer control (data not
shown). Thus, these results further show that reductions in tumor
burden were not simply related to injection of nonviable cells.
Ouabain treatment of mice decreases the in vivo survival of
circulating prostate cancer cells. As a more rigorous measure of
the effects of ouabain on distant tumor formation, mice were
injected i.v. with dsRed-labeled PPC-1 cells followed by daily i.p.
injections of ouabain (0.67 mg/kg) or PBS for 2 weeks. Treatment
of mice with ouabain resulted in decreased tumor formation in
the lungs, liver, bones, and lymph nodes when compared with
mice treated with PBS 5 weeks after injection of cells. Ouabain
decreased the size and number of tumors in the lungs compared
with buffer-treated animals (Fig. 6A and B).
To determine whether ouabain decreased distant tumor
formation simply by decreasing cellular proliferation, PPC-1 dsRed
cells were injected s.c. into subleathally irradiated SCID mice. In
contrast to its effects on distant tumor formation, ouabain did not
alter the growth of the subcutaneous tumors (Fig. 6C). Thus,
reduction in distant tumor formation after treatment with ouabain
is consistent with sensitization to anoikis and is not solely due to
reductions in cellular proliferation.
Similar results were also achieved in a mouse model of pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumor metastasis. i.p. injection of BON1 cells
results in peritoneal spread and liver metastasis. Treatment of mice

www.aacrjournals.org

with ouabain (0.67 mg/kg) via daily s.c. injections for 4 weeks
decreased tumor weight and spread (data not shown). Thus, taken
together, inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase inhibits distant tumor
formation in multiple mouse models of metastasis.

Discussion
Anoikis serves as a physiologic barrier to metastasis. Resistance
to anoikis permits cancer cells to survive in circulation and
facilitates their metastasis to distant organs (10, 22, 26, 27).
Clinically, the presence of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral
blood of patients afflicted with solid malignancies correlates with
worse clinical outcome in some but not all studies (28–31). Thus,
understanding the mechanism of anoikis will improve our
understanding of the process of metastasis. In addition, these
results highlight the potential therapeutic adjunct to decrease
metastasis and improve patient outcome.
To further our understanding of anoikis, we developed,
automated, and conducted a chemical screen for anoikis
sensitizers. From this screen, we identified a family of cardiac
glycosides, two of which, digoxin and digitoxin are used to treat
patients with congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias (32).
These compounds exert a positive inotropic effect on the heart due
to their ability to inhibit the Na+/K+ ATPase pump which leads to a
concomitant increase in intracellular calcium (33).
Using genetic and chemical approaches, we showed that cardiac
glycosides sensitize cells to anoikis by inhibiting their known target
the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. The Na+/K+ ATPase pump is a transmembrane protein that transports potassium ions into and sodium
ions out of eukaryotic cells against their natural gradients (34).
Cardiac glycosides bind to the pump at a regulatory site that is
located on the extracellular side on the a-subunit of the enzyme
(35). This inhibition results in an increase in intracellular Na+, and
a decrease in intracellular K+ (24). These results support the Na+/K+
ATPase pump as the target for the effects of ouabain on anoikis.
However, we concede that ouabain may also bind additional
unidentified targets that influence its effects on anoikis.
Increased intracellular Na+ causes an influx of water through
osmosis to balance the ionic concentrations of the cytoplasm to
the extracellular environment. Consistent with this process,

inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump increased cell size.
Furthermore, culturing cells in hypotonic medium also sensitized
them to anoikis. Thus, our results suggest that the osmotic stress
produced by ouabain is functionally important for anoikis
sensitization because cells cultured in hypotonic medium were
also sensitized to anoikis. We also showed that ouabain sensitized
cells to anoikis by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane
potential and activating the mitochondrial pathway of caspase
activation. Consistent with a connection to the induction of
osmotic stress, prior studies have reported that cells cultured in
hypotonic media experience loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential (36). Thus, we highlight a new strategy to restore
sensitization to anoikis that targets the Na+/K+ ATPase pump and
the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation.
Cardiac glycosides can directly induce cell death in cells through
multiple and complex mechanisms including, increasing Ca2+
concentration (37), decreasing nuclear factor-nB DNA binding (38)
and through the up-regulation of the death receptors DR4 and DR5
(39). However, in the cells tested in this study, the concentrations of
cardiac glycosides required to sensitize cells to anoikis were lower
than the concentrations required to induce cell death.
Cardiac glycosides may also have anticancer effects in patients
(40–42). Five years after mastectomy, patients receiving cardiac
glycosides had a f10-fold lower rate of relapse and improved
survival, than patient not receiving these drugs (43–46). Despite
these clinical findings, the mechanism(s) by which cardiac glycosides exert an anticancer effect and prevent metastasis are unclear.
Based on our study, it is tempting to suggest that the antimetastatic
effect of cardiac glycosides could be partly attributed to their effect
on anoikis. However, caution must be taken in accepting this
conclusion. The maximal therapeutic plasma concentrations of
digitoxin and digoxin are 30 and 2 nmol/L, respectively (47). These

concentrations are lower than the concentration of ouabain
required to sensitize cells to anoikis. However, it is unknown what
concentration of ouabain can be achieved in humans. In addition,
the results in our mouse models of distant tumor formation must
also be interpreted with caution. The rodent Na+/K+ ATPase pump
is less sensitive to inhibition by cardiac glycosides and the mouse
heart is less sensitive to arrhythmias that could be produced by
high doses of cardiac glycosides. Therefore, the antimetastatic
effects we observed in mice after ouabain treatment may not be
relevant to humans. Another limitation to our study is that the
studies of distant tumor formation and retention were conducted
in sublethally irradiated SCID mice. Radiation was used to reduce
residual immune function known to be present in SCID mice (25)
and improved distant tumor formation. However, we concede that
the radiation may have altered the integrity of the endothelium
that may have skewed our results. Nonetheless, this work identifies
a novel mechanism that influences anoikis. In addition, it suggests
that Na+/K+ ATPase pump inhibitors that have less cardiac effects
could be leads for anticancer agents.
