ABSTRACT
Checkpoint programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligands (PD-Ls)
have been identified as negative immunoregulatory molecules that promote immune
evasion of tumor cells. The interaction of PD-1 and PD-Ls inhibits the function of
T cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) while increasing the function of
immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs). This condition causes the tumor cells
to evade immune response. Thus, the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 enhances anti-tumor
immunity by reducing the number and/or the suppressive activity of Tregs and by
restoring the activity of effector T cells. Furthermore, some monoclonal antibodies
blockading PD-1/PD-Ls axis have achieved good effect and received Food and Drug
Administration approval. The role of PD-1/PD-Ls in tumors has been well studied, but
little is known on the mechanism by which PD-1 blocks T-cell activation. In this study,
we provide a brief overview on the discovery and regulatory mechanism of PD-1 and
PD-L1 dysregulation in tumors, as well as the function and signaling pathway of PD-1
and its ligands; their roles in tumor evasion and clinical treatment were also studied.

INTRODUCTION

Although tumor cells express numerous antigens,
tumor evades T-cell responses and host immunity
through negative regulators of the immune system,
such as programmed death-1 (PD-1), programmed
cell death-ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell deathligand-2 (PD-L2), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4
(CTLA-4), T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 3 (TIM3),
2B4, the B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), and
lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) [10-12]. Among
these regulators, CTLA-4 is a type 1 transmembrane
glycoprotein mainly expressed on activated T cells.
CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell function through intracellular
signaling regulation via T-cell receptor (TCR) and
CD28 in tumors [12, 13]. LAG3 (CD223) is a type
I membrane glycoprotein of the immunogloblin (Ig)
superfamily expressed in several different cell types, such
as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), B cells, natural
killer T cells, γ and δ T cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells,
and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Association of LAG3
with PD-1 inhibits signaling passway in T-cell [12, 14].
TIM3 is a transmembrane molecule associated with CD8+
T-cell dysfunction and exhaustion. TIM3 is overexpressed

Under normal physiological conditions, the major
function of PD-1 is to inhibit effector T-cell activity and
enhance the function and development of Tregs, which
inhibit T-cell responses and prevent overstimulation of
immune responses in peripheral tissues [1, 2]. The PD-1
pathway can protect the host against autoimmunity [3].
PD-1 pathway plays a key role in the regulation
of antifungal and virus immunity [4]. PD-1 knockout
(Pdcd1−/−) mice can lead to tissue sensitive to infection
or late onset autoimmune disease with variable incidence
depending on the background strain carrying the PD1
null animal [5-7]. Whereas, blockade of PD-1 enhances
both proliferation of memory B cells and expansion
of virus-specific CD8 T cells during chronic simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques [8].
In persistently infected mice lacking CD4 T-cell help,
blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway had a
beneficial effect on the ‘helpless’ CD8 T cells, restoring
their ability to undergo proliferation, secrete cytokines,
kill infected cells, and decrease the viral load [9].

on Tregs in tumor microenvironment. Tregs is related
to ovarian tumor size. Blockade of TIM3 restores the
inhibitory functions of tumor-infiltrating Tregs [15]. PD-1
and PD-L1/PD-L2 are identified as immune checkpoints
that inhibit effector T-cell activity [1, 16].
PD-L1 is overrepresented in the presence of
tumor and promotes immune evasion and growth of
tumor by suppressing T-cell response [17]. PD-1/PD-L1
plays critical roles in cancer immunology, and blocking
antibodies against this receptor provide benefits in clinical
trials, with the first of this class recently approved by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients
with refractory malignancies [16]. Recently, blockade of
PD-1/PD-L1 has been found to treat effectively cancer by
enhancing immunity. Several studies on Abs blockade of
the PD-1 receptor (nivolumab, MK3475, or combination
of nivolumab with the anti-CTLA4 checkpoint inhibitor
ipilimumab) have improved survival profiles and acquired
high response rates in several solid tumors [18-22]. In
melanoma refractory to targeted therapy, pembrolizumab
which is a humanized monoclonal IgG4-kappa isotype
antibody against PD-1 induced overall response rates
(ORRs) of 21%-34%. Among the patients with refractory
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pembrolizumab
induced ORRs of 19%-25%. On the basis of these results,
pembrolizumab was approved by the USA FDA to treat
advanced melanoma and NSCLC [23].
The function of PD-1 in peripheral tolerance
and anti-tumor immune response is well established.
Moreover, blockade of the PD-1 pathway has achieved
good effect on restraining tumor. However, the exact
mechanism of dysregulation of PD-1 and its ligands is
still unknown. In addition, the manner of PD-1 ligation
exerting its effects on specific signaling targets and how
these altered signaling events affect T-cell function are yet
to be completely understood.

switch motif (ITSM, TxYxxL) [24, 25, 31, 32]. The
amino acid sequence around the C-terminal tyrosine
(TEYATIVF) of PD-1 is well conserved between mouse
and human and is related to SHP-1 and SHP-2. Whereas,
the N-terminal tyrosine of PD-1 does not associate with
either SHP-1 or SHP-2 [33].
PD-1 can promote the development, immunity
evasion, and prognosis of several kinds of solid tumor,
such as NSCLC, melanoma, breast cancer (BC), and
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [34]. Thompson’s research
showed that PD-1 was expressed in 56% of nephrectomy
specimens of patients with RCC. PD-1 is also expressed
in the T cells rather than in RCC tumor cells. Furthermore,
the expression of PD-1 was associated with tumor stage,
the presence of necrosis or sarcomatoid differentiation,
and poor 5 year survival rate [35]. In classical Hodgkin
lymphoma (cHL) and mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma,
the extended PD-1 ligand/9p24.1 amplification region
contains the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) locus. JAK2
amplification promoted protein expression and activity,
specifically inducing PD-1 ligand transcription and
enhancing sensitivity to JAK2 inhibition. Therefore,
PD-1 ligand/9p24.1 amplification is a disease-specific
structural alteration that increases both the gene dosage
of PD-1 ligands and their induction by JAK2, defining
the PD-1 pathway and JAK2 as complementary rational
therapeutic targets [36]. Programmed death 1 expression
in the peritumoral microenvironment is an independent
prognostic factor for Overall Survival (OS) of patient
of cHL and is related to poor prognosis in cHL [37].
Similarly, epithelial-originated malignancy patients with
PD-1 positive expression on TILs exhibited significantly
shorter OS than the PD-1 negative group [38].
PD-1 is inducibly expressed on activated immune
cell types including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B
cells, natural killer T cells, activated monocytes, DCs,
macrophages [10, 28, 29, 39]. Moreover, PD-1 is
selectively upregulated in T cells because of persistent
exposure to antigens; thus, the expression of PD-1 in T
cells is one of the makers of exhausted T cells [40-42].
A few mechanisms are involved in PD-1 expression
regulation [43, 44]. Two upstream conserved regulatory
regions of PD-1 gene termed as conserved regions B
and C (CR-B and CR-C) exist. CR-B and CR-C are
hypersensitive to DNase I and are important for PD-1
expression. CR-C was reported to contain a nuclear factor
of activated T cells (NFAT) site, which is important for the
transcriptional expression of Pdcd1, whereas, the role of
CR-B is yet to be known [45]. In CD4+ and CD8+ T cells,
the transcriptional activator nuclear factor of activated
T cells c1 (NFATc1; also known as NFAT2) binding
to CR-C and c-Fos binding to a site located in CR-B
enhance the expression of PD-1 after TCR stimulation
during the initial phases of Ag recognition [46, 47]. Xiao
et al. identified that tumor-infiltrating T cells significantly
upregulated the expression of the activator protein 1 (AP-

PD-1 AND THE REGULATION OF PD-1
EXPRESSION
PD-1 (also called CD279) was first isolated from
2B4.11 (a murine T-cell hybridoma) and interleukin-3
(IL-3)-deprived LyD9 (a murine hematopoietic progenitor
cell line) by using subtractive hybridization technique
[24]. PD-1 is encoded by the Pdcd1, which is located
on chromosome 2 (2q37) [25-27]. PD-1 is one of the
member of B7/CD28 family [28, 29]. PD-1 is also a 288
amino acid (55 kDa) type I transmembrane protein of the
immune globulin superfamily, comprising an extracellular
N-terminal IgV-like domain, a transmembrane domain,
and a cytoplasmic tail [24, 26, 30]. There are two tyrosine
residues in the cytoplasmic tail of PD-1; the N-terminal
of which is involved in a sequence defined as the
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM,
I/L/VXYXXL/V); the C-terminal tyrosine is engaged in
a sequence defined as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based

1) subunit c-Fos. C-Fos (AP-1) directly binds to CR-B in
the Pdcd1 (gene encoding PD-1) proximal promoter which
increases PD-1 expression and enhances antitumor T cell
function and restrained tumor growth [48, 49]. Bally et
al. identified that NF-ΚB p65 binds to a region which
located upstream of PD-1 gene in CR-C and enhances
PD-1 expression following stimulation of macrophages
with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [50].
The 55 kDa src kinase-associated protein (SKAP55)
and the adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor
protein (ADAP) are located at the killing synapses between
CD8+ CTLs and tumor cells [51, 52]. Specifically, ADAP
binds to SKAP55 and stabilizes its expression at protein
level. Most importantly, ADAP-SKAP55 enhances
PD-1 expression in a Fyn-, Ca2+-, and NFATc1 manner.
ADAP-SKAP55 module enhances both total and activated
NFATc1, which enhances PD-1 expression by binding to
the promoter of PD-1. The ADAP-SKAP55-PD-1 pathway
represents a “self-control” mechanism to control T-cell
activation and adhesion precisely [46].
Multiple cytokines, such as the common γ-chain
family (IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21) and type I IFNs
(IFN- and IFN-β) can also upregulate PD-1 expression
[53]. However, with the exception of IFN-α inducing
responses from an interferon-stimulated regulatory
element (ISRE) located in CR-C, no direct effect
of cytokine-induced factors regulating Pdcd1 gene
expression has been shown [49]. Kato et al. demonstrated

that the concentration of IL-6 was in a high level, which
is correlated to poor growth of cytomegalovirus (CMV)specific T cells and high PD-1 expression on CMV
specific T cells, and that disruption of IL-6 or the IL-6
receptor (IL-6R) interaction recovered CMV-specific
T-cell growth. IL-6 and IL-12 induce the signal transducer
and activator of transcription (STAT) activity STAT3
and STAT4, respectively, via the JAK family of proteins.
STAT activity could change the chromatin structure of
Pdcd1 and increase the PD-1 expression in splenic CD8
T cells. The NFATc1/STAT regulatory regions interact
with the promoter region of the Pdcd1 gene and increase
PD-1 expression following cytokine stimulation. Austin
et al. found that Pdcd1 was regulated by distal elements,
which is a non-biased approach employed across the
murine Pdcd1 locus. Their group also found four novel
distal regulatory regions. Two of these elements is located
on the side of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). The third
element, located upstream of CR-C, bound NFATc1
and STAT3 or STAT4 in response to TCR and IL-6 or
IL-12 signaling, respectively. The final region, located
close to the downstream CTCF site also bound NFATc1
and STAT3 or STAT4. Each of the novel NFAT/STAT
elements interacts with the Pdcd1 promoter region and the
chromatin structure of each regulatory region is altered
in response to T-cell activation and cytokine stimulation
in CD8 T cells, demonstrating that NFAT/STAT elements
is associated with PD-1 expression [49, 54]. Vascular

endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) promotes PD-1
expression and other inhibitory checkpoints, which are
involved in exhaustion of vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor (VEGFR) expressing CD8+ T cells in vitro.
Voron et al. identified that blockade of VEGF-A-VEGFR
was sufficient to decrease PD-1 expression in intratumoral
CD8+ T cells. Sunitinib, a multitarget tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) that inhibits VEGFR1, R2, R3, plateletderived growth factor receptors, and stem cell factor
receptor, has been shown to suppress PD-1 expression
at the mRNA level in tumor-infiltrating T cells [43, 55].
In addition, endogenous transforming growth factor-β
(TGF-β) is also involved partially in PD-1 expression
through TCR activation in T cells [56]. The main signaling
pathways of PD-1 transcriptional regulation are shown in
Figure 1.
By contrast, some transcriptional repressors inhibit
PD-1 expression [47]. T-bet binds directly to Pdcd1 within
a region of ~500 bp upstream of the transcriptional start
site, near or within the CR-B region. This condition
directly represses Pdcd1 transcription. When the antigen
is persisted, T-bet expression is decreased in T cells; thus
PD-1 expression is increased and functions of T cells
are inhibited [45]. Meanwhile, the repressive effect of
T-bet on PD-1 expression is not enhanced when T-bet is
overexpressed. This condition indicates that other factors
may also participate in inhibiting PD-1 expression. The
B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1),
which is encoded by the prdm1 gene, represses PD-1 gene
expression through a feed-forward repressive circuit. On
one hand, Blimp-1 binds to a site between CR-B and
CR-C of the PD-1 gene to inhibit directly PD-1 gene
transcription. On the other hand, Blimp-1 inhibits the
expression of NFATc1 and displaces it from CR-C, leading
to downregulation of PD-1 expression [47].

indicated that PD-L1 expression was an independent,
poor prognostic factor for malignant melanoma [61]. PDL2 may lead to local cytokine production that is beneficial
to the tumor cells [62]. PD-L1 and PD-L2 play different
roles in immune regulatory process although both are
ligands of PD-1 [63]. PD-L1 inhibits T-cell function in
peripheral tissues, whereas PD-L2 suppresses immune
T-cell activation in lymphoid organs. PD-L2 inhibits type
2 T-helper (Th-2) lymphocytes, but its role is yet to be
fully understood [53, 64].
PD-L1 is expressed on immune cells, including
T cells, B cells, DCs, and macrophages [3, 57]. PD-L1
is overrepresented on several types of solid tumor cells,
such as glioblastoma multiforme, NSCLC, and some
hematologic malignancies [34]. Unlike PD-L1, which
is expressed broadly, the expression of PD-L2/B7DC is limited. PD-L2 is expressed mainly on antigenpresenting cells (APCs), including macrophages and
myeloid DCs, and non-hematopoietic tissues, such
as the lung [62, 63]. PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed
on Respiratory tract epithelial cells (BEAS-2B cells).
Moreover, the expression of respiratory tract epithelial
cells is upregulated by respiratory tract virus infection or
treatment with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-4. PD-L1 was
moderately expressed, and PD-L2 was weakly expressed
in unstimulated NCI-H292, BEAS-2B, and A549 cells
[65]. Similarly, Kan-o et al. identified that polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid (poly IC) upregulates the expression of
B7-H1 via activation of the NF-κB. Poly IC increases the
generation of reactive oxygen species, which enhances
the activation of PI3Kδ and NF-κB. In addition, poly ICinduced upregulation of B7-H1 was observably suppressed
by a pan-PI3K inhibitor and partially by an inhibitor or a
small interfering (si)RNA for PI3Kδ in BEAS-2B cells
[66].
Both PD-L1 mRNA and protein can be upregulated
by cytokines produced by infiltrating immune cells, such
as IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, growth cell stem factors, bacterial
LPS, and VEGF [10, 26, 44, 59, 67]. Several pathways
exist that IFN-γ increases PD-L1 expression. Abiko et
al. found that IFN-γ secreted by CD8+ lymphocytes
upregulates PD-L1 in ovarian cancer cells and promotes
progression of ovarian cancer. In mouse models,
suppressing IFNGR1 (IFN-γ receptor 1) remarkably
reduced the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells.
By contrast, the injection of IFN-γ into subcutaneous
tumors increased PD-L1 expression and promoted tumor
growth [68]. Moreover, IFN-γ or toll-like receptor (TLR)
stimulation upregulated PD-L1 expression in blast cells
from patients with acute myeloid leukemia through MEK/
ERK- and MyD88/TRAF6 pathway [69]. Chen et al.
demonstrated that protein kinase D isoform 2 (PKD2),
which is induced by IFN-γ, is an important regulator of
PD-L1 expression in human oral squamous carcinoma
cells. Inhibition of PKD2 activation not only suppresses
PD-L1 expression and enhances an anti-tumor effect but

PD-1 LIGANDS AND THE REGULATION
OF THEIR EXPRESSION
PD-1 is involved in immune tolerance by
suppressing activated immune cells via interaction with
its ligands. Two known ligands of PD-1 are PD-L1 and
PD-L2 [3, 29, 57]. B7-H1 was originally named as the first
gene homolog of B7 molecules, and B7-H1 was renamed
as PD-L1 after it has been identified as the first ligand
of the receptor PD-1 (CD279) in the murine system [58].
PD-L1 gene is located in chromosome 9p24 [36, 59]. PDL1 is a 290-amino-acid transmembrane glycoprotein [58,
60]. The second known counter-receptor of PD-1, called
B7-DC or PD-L2, is also a member of the B7 family [58].
Hino et al. indicated that the degree of PD-L1 expression
was correlated to the vertical growth of primary tumors
in melanoma. Furthermore, multivariate analysis
demonstrated that the survival rate of the PD-L1 highexpression patients was remarkably lower than that of the
low-expression patients with stage II melanoma, which

also reduces drug resistance during chemotherapy [69]. By
contrast, natural killer (NK) cell activation and secretion
of IFN-γ significantly enhanced PD-L1 expression by
activating JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1 in tumor cells.
Inhibition of JAK pathway activation abrogates increased
PD-L1 expression, which enhanced sensibility of tumor
cells to NK cell activity [70]. Maine et al. identified that
the concentrations of IL-10 and TGF-β in ascites were
higher in patients with malignant ovarian tumors than with
benign/border-line ovarian tumors. Both IL-10 and TGF-β
can increase PD-L1 in monocytes in vitro. Blocking IL-10
with a neutralizing antibody reduced PD-L1 expression
[71].
PD-L1 can be upregulated not only by some
inflammatory cytokines but also by constitutive oncogene
pathway activation [72]. In gene level, oncogenic signaling
pathways in tumor cells, such as IFN-γ/JAK2/IFN, ALK/
STAT3, PI3K, and MEK/ERK/STAT1 can activate PDL1 expression [72-74]. Chen et al. demonstrated that
the expression of PD-L1 was higher in EGFR-mutant
NSCLC cell lines than that in cell lines with wild-type
EGFR. Three models of EGFR activation including EGF
stimulation, EGFR-19del and EGFR-L858R mutation can
increase PD-L1 expression via p-ERK1/2/p-c-Jun and
p-AKT/p-S6 pathway [72]. Moreover, exposure to EGFR
inhibitor-TKIs can decrease the expression of PD-L1
[73]. Ota’s research has shown that the level of PD-L1

expression in NSCLC cells positive for EML4-ALK is
higher than those in wild-type for both EGFR and ALK.
EML4-ALK can upregulate PD-L1 expression at the
mRNA and protein levels in Ba/F3 via activating PI3KAKT [74]. The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met binding
to its ligand hepatocyte growth factor can remarkably
promote the expression of PD-L1 via activating Ras-PI3K
signaling pathway, and this condition can be disrupted
following treatment of the cells with pharmacological
inhibitors of c-Met [75]. Moreover, Parsa et al. identified
that the loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)
and the resulting activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
kinase (PI-3K) pathway enhanced PD-L1 expression in
glioma [72, 76].
In addition, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) is also a major regulator of PD-L1 mRNA and
protein expression. Hypoxia causes a rapid, dramatic,
and selective upregulation of PD-L1 in splenic myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, DCs,
and tumor cells in tumor-bearing mice through HIF-1α.
Binding of HIF-1α to a transcriptionally active hypoxiaresponse elements (HREs), HRE-4 and HRE-1, at two
different HRE sites in the PD-L1 proximal promoter in
hypoxic MSC-1 cells is comparable with their binding
to an established HRE in VEGF, lactate dehydrogenase
A (LDHA), and Glut1 genes [77]. Boes et al. identified
that TLR3 triggering results in remarkably upregulation

of PD-L1 on neuroblastoma cells. In addition, docking
protein 3 (DOK3) increases PD-1 ligand expression
through abrogating the intensity of calcium signaling at
the transcriptional level. DOK3 recruits growth factor
receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2). Together, DOK3 and
Grb2 sequester Bruton tyrosine kinase and diminish PLCγ
2 activation and, thereby, attenuate calcium signaling.
Calcineurin inhibition study demonstrated that calcium
signaling directly negatively regulates PD-1 ligand
gene expression [78-82]. Above all, the main signaling
pathways of PD-L1 transcriptional regulation are shown
in Figure 2.
Despite recent study efforts on PD-L2, the
transcriptional regulation of the ligand is yet to be
completely clarified [63]. Several inflammatory cytokines,
especially IL-4, upregulate the expression of PD-L2 on
DCs and macrophages [34, 83, 84].

PD-1 recruits the SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatase, PI3K/
Akt pathway was inhibited. This condition inhibits cell
survival proteins, such as B-cell lymphoma-xL (Bcl-xL)
which is important for the intrinsic apoptotic pathway;
decreases expression of glucose transporters on the plasma
membrane and general downregulation of glycolytic
enzyme activity, which depresses proliferation of T cells,
thereby restraining its survival and decreasing protein
synthesis; inhibits CD28-mediated activation and triggers
chromatin changes so that the promoter regions of IL-2,
TNF-α, and IFN-γ are decreased [28, 96]. Downregulation
of IL-2 secretion, driven partially through early growth
response protein 2 (EGR2), induces CD8+ T and CD4+
T-cell anergy [97, 98].
Moreover, studies revealed that engagement of
PD-1 by PD-L1 inhibited PLC-γ1 and RAS activation and
suppressed MEK/Erk MAP pathway [99, 100]. CalDAG
is activated downstream of PLC-γ156 promote Ras GRP1
activation. Ras GRP1 promotes exchange of Ras-GDP
to Ras-GTP, which suppresses MEK/Erk, suppressing
T-cell proliferation. The effect of PD-1 on MEK/Erk and
MAP kinases was selective because PD-1 ligation did not
inhibit the activation of Jnk and p38 MAP kinases [100,
101]. Engagement of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibits multiple
transcription factors of T cells expression, such as GATA3 and T-bet, repressing T-cell response [10, 102]. T-bet
is a master transcription factor, which can downregulate
inhibitory receptors and is essential for differentiation
and function of Th1 cells, CD8+ T cells [45, 101, 103].
High level of T-bet maintains exhausted CD8+ T cells and
represses inhibitory receptor expression [45]. In addition,
the patients with increased level of T-bet+ lymphocytes in
tumor of nest and stroma exhibit longer survival time than
the low level of such cells [94, 104].
PD-1 can also suppress cell cycle progression of
T cell by influencing various regulators of the cell cycle.
However, the mechanism is yet to be totally understood.
PD-1 signaling prevents cell cycle progression in the G1
phase by increasing the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)
inhibitors p27 kip1 and p15 INK4B and repressing the
Cdk-activating phosphatase Cdc25A expression. PD-1
inhibits Skp2 by inhibiting PIK3/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK
signaling leading to increase of p27kip1 and inhibition
of Cdk2. Cdk2 restraint decreases phosphorylation of Rb
and fails to phosphorylate the checkpoint inhibitor Smad3,
which inhibits cell cycle progression from the G1 to the S
phase in the Cdk2-specific site enhancing transcriptional
activity of Smad3 and upregulating p15INK4B expression
and restraining the Cdk-activating phosphatase Cdc25A
[105, 106].

FUNCTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF
ALTERED BIOCHEMICAL SIGNALING
INDUCED BY PD-1
PD-1/PD-L1 axis inhibits T cell response
PD-1/PD-L1 suppresses the effector phase of T-cell
response. This condition induces immune tolerance during
different phases of T-cell responses, such as regulating
the threshold for T-cell activation, inhibiting T-cell
proliferation, and promoting apoptosis in activated T cells.
The mechanism of PD-1/PD-L1 regulation is correlated
with dephosphorylation of signaling molecules belonging
to TCR pathway and transmission of inhibitory signal to
T cells [31, 85-88]. TCR signaling leads to intracellular
Ca2+ flux, which activates multiple signaling pathways
required for differentiation and activation of T-cell. PD-1
on T-cell binding to PD-L1 or PD-L2 on APC can activate
Lck-mediated phosphorylation of cytoplasmic domain
tyrosine and recruitment of SHP-2 to the C-terminal
tyrosine of PD-1 cytoplasmic domain [27, 89]. SHP-2 and
SHP-1 are two highly related tyrosine phosphatases, which
dephosphorylate TCR-proximal signaling molecules,
such as protein kinase Cθ, CD3ζ, PI3K and zeta-chainassociated protein kinase (ZAP70), and Syk downstream
of B cell antigen receptor (BCR), leading to inhibition
of downstream signaling [89, 90]. SHP-2 and SHP-1 are
recruited to ITSM of PD-1, leading to inhibition of the
PI3K/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling
pathways downstream of the TCR and blockade of cellcycle progression in the immune cells [91]. Whereas,
PD-1/PD-Ls inhibit Ca2+ flux increasing the number of
engaged TCRs required to initiate a Ca2+ flux [92].
PI3K/Akt pathway activation increases Glut1
expression and enhances glucose uptake inducing
glycolysis and protein synthesis in T cells [93-95]. After

inhibits
tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL) and increases immunosuppressive Treg function

differentiating into Foxp3+ Tregs under the circumstances
of CD3 and TGF-β. Foxp3 is a critical transcription factor
of Tregs, which suppress Th1 responses [94]. Foxp3+
Tregs is a highly immunosuppressive subset of CD4+
T cells that is critical in s uppressing proliferation and
cytokine production of other T cells, inhibiting tumorspecific immune responses and maintaining peripheral
immune tolerance in cancer patients [114]. Meanwhile,
Treg cells express constitutive high levels of PD-1, which
enhance Treg functional response or proliferation and
inhibit T cells responses [115, 116].

Engagement of PD-1 and PD-L1 restrains the
proliferation, survival, and effector function of CD8+ CTL
and promotes apoptosis of TILs [10, 107]. High level of
PD-1 expression along with other inhibitory receptors
inhibits functions of TILs and decreases its quantity in
tumor microenvironment [35, 83, 108]. In addition, TILs
increase expression of PD-L1, tryptophan-catabolizing
enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and FoxP3+
Tregs in the melanoma tumor microenvironment. This
condition indicates that TILs are involved in immuneintrinsic negative feedback loop. IDO is in charge of
the dissimilation of tryptophan, and influences immune
reactions in several situations. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction
increases the level of IDO, which exhausts T cells of
essential tryptophan and suppresses its metabolites,
leading to inhibition of T-cell activation and increasing
the number of regulatory T cell [109, 110].
PD-1 pathway activation not only downregulates
effector T-cell function but also increases immunosuppressive Treg function [63]. PD-L1 expression on
non-hematopoietic and hematopoietic cells accelerates
Treg development and improves Treg function in immune
organs and autoimmune attacked tissues [3, 111]. PD-1−/−
conventional CD4+ T cells demonstrated a remarkably
diminished tendency toward differentiation into
peripherally induced Treg (pTreg) cells, which showed
that PD-1 is critical for the extrathymic differentiation of
pTreg cells in vivo [112]. Previous studies suggested that
the number of circulating Tregs of lung cancer patients
was nearly twofold compared with healthy controls
and the expression levels of PD-1 on Tregs were higher
in lung cancer samples than in controls [113]. These
results suggest that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a
role in Treg induction and is associated with impaired
adaptive immunity. In the tumor microenvironment,
PD-1 expressed on Tregs accelerates CD4+ T cells

ANTIBODY BLOCKADE OF PD-1/PD-L1 ON
THE TREATMENT OF TUMORS
Efficacy of inhibition of the PD-1 pathway
Blocking PD-1 passway successfully improves
T-cell responses in vitro and promotes tumor regression
in vivo in animals [117, 118]. In vitro, antibody blockade
of PD-1/PD-L1 enhances antitumor immune responses
by decreasing the number and/or the suppressive activity
of regulatory T cells and by rescuing of the activity of
effector T cells in tissues and the tumor microenvironment.
In addition, PD-1/PD-L1 antibody blockade decreases the
percentages of the highly immunosuppressive MDSC
population. Likewise, blockade of PD-1 in B cells may
also enhance activity of natural killer cells and increase
antigen-specific antibody production via PD-1 positive
(PD-1+) B cells [63, 119]. Several studies on syngeneic
mouse tumor models demonstrated that the blockade of
PD-1/PD-L1 enhances antitumor activity. The level of
effector CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and myeloidderived suppressor cells increased in tumor in mice with
PD-1 blockade injected with B16 melanoma cells; T cell
proliferation and cytokine production were also enhanced,
and tumor sites recruited more effector cells [120, 121].
Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 has significant influences on
different CD4+ T-cell subsets. PD-1 blockade enhanced

production of IFN, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17 and the
reduced production of the Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13
[122, 123]. This condition reveals that PD-1 blockade may
promote antitumor activity through tipping the Th1/Th2
balance and through stimulation of Th17 cells.
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade demonstrates suppression of
tumor growth and less metastases. In the mouse model
of bladder cancer, the antibody blockade of PD-1 can
increase the number of circulating tumor-specific CD107aexpressing CD8+ T cells and activated (CD25+ FoxP3-)
CD4+ splenocytes, as well as significantly reduces tumor
size [124]. Monoclonal antibodies blockade of PD-1/
PD-L1 has revealed great effect outcomes for a subset of
patients with cancer, especially in PD-L1 positive tumors,
such as melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung,
kidney, and esophageal cancers, as well as hematological
malignancies [19, 112]. The expression of PD-L1 in tumor
cells is related to the response of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
and may be proposed as a potentially valuable predictive
marker for the responsiveness of various cancers,
including malignant melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC to PDL1 or PD-1 blocking antibodies [125].

or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14% of
patients with advanced melanoma [128].
Nivolumab is also a MAb of PD-1, which has
shown positive therapeutic activity and an acceptable
safety profile in treating tumors [19]. In December
2014, the U.S. FDA granted an accelerated approval to
nivolumab to treat patients with unresectable or metastatic
melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab
and if patients are B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine
kinase (BRAF) V600 mutation positive, which is a BRAF
inhibitor [129]. Treatment with nivolumab was first
reported in 2012 (sponsored by BMS). Overall response
rates and median survival were 28% and 24 months,
respectively. The 1 and 2 year survival rates were 62%
and 43%, respectively [19, 89]. A multi-dose phase I
dose-escalation trial extended the above findings. In this
study, 296 patients with the same advanced cancers were
given nivolumab at doses from 0.1 mg kg−1 to 10 mg kg−1
every 2 weeks for up to 2 years. Objective responses were
observed in 18.4% patients with NSCLC, 27.6% patients
with melanoma, and 27.2% patients with RCC. No
tumor responses were observed in patients with castrateresistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or carcinoma of colon
and rectum (CRC). Treatment-related adverse events were
fatigue, anorexia, nausea, rash, and diarrhea. Grade 3 or 4
toxicities were reported in 14% of patients and evident at
all dose levels without obvious dose dependency [130].
A study of 107 patients with melanoma were treated with
nivolumab between 2008 and 2012 revealed an overall
survival of 16.8 months. The 1 and 2 year survival rates
were 62% and 43%, respectively. Objective responses
were observed in 31% of patients. The appearance of irAE
was 54%, but grades 3 and 4 adverse events were only
seen in five patients (5%) [20].
Pidilizumab is a humanized IgG-1 kappa
recombinant mAb. It was developed from a murine
version, mCT-011 or BAT, that was generated with the
immunization of Balb/c mice with membranes of a human
B-cell lymphoma cell line [131]. In a Phase I study, 17
patients with hematologic malignancies were treated
with escalating doses of pidilizumab ( 0.2 to 6.0 mg/kg).
Of the 17 treated patients no clear toxicity reaction was
observed during therapy. 33% patients acquired clinical
benefit and one acquired complete remission. The study
showed the antibody to be safe and well tolerated in this
patient population [132]. In an International Phase II Trial,
66 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
were treated. Treatment-related adverse events was mild.
At 16 months after the first treatment, progression-free
survival (PFS) was 0.72 (90% CI, 0.60 to 0.82). Among
the 24 high-risk patients, PFS was 0.70 (90% CI, 0.51 to
0.82). The study suggested an on-target in vivo effect of
pidilizumab [133].
AMP-224 is the first recombinant B7-DC-Fc fusion
protein. In a PhaseI trial, patients with advanced solid
tumors received low dose cyclophosphamide (CTX) on

Clinical trials of mAbs to PD-1
Pembrolizumab is a highly selective, humanized
monoclonal IgG4-kappa isotype antibody against PD-1,
which binds to the PD-1 receptor on T cells and prevents
PD-1 binding to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 [126].
Pembrolizumab is the first PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor
for advanced melanoma approved by FDA after the
CTLA-4 inhibitor-ipilimumab [127]. Pembrolizumab
has remarkable anti-tumor activity and treatmentrelated toxicity is acceptable. A total of 135 patients
with advanced melanoma were in phase 1 study of
pembrolizumab. Approximately 38%-52% of patients
treated with doses ranging from 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks
to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks showed long-lasting objective
responses. In addition, 81% of patients survived for
at least 1 year from the beginning of treatment. Grade
1 or 2 adverse events were shown in the majority of
patients. 13% of patients have shown grade 3 or 4 adverse
events. This result indicated that patients with advanced
melanoma treated with pembrolizumab result in a high
rate of sustained tumor regression [34]. Robert et al.
assessed the clinical effect of pembrolizumab. 173 patients
with advanced melanoma received pembrolizumab
treatment. The follow-up time was 8 months and ORR
was 26%. This result suggested that pembrolizumab is an
effective treatment option for patients with ipilimumabrefractory advanced melanoma, wherein few effective
treatment options are available [126]. Another trail showed
that treatment of advanced melanoma patients with
pembrolizumab acquired an overall objective response
rate of 33%, 12 month progression-free survival rate of
35%, and median overall survival of 23 months; grade 3

Day 0, followed by AMP-224 (IV infusion, 0.3 to 30
mg/kg) on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Infusion
reactions were observed at higher doses (86% at the 10
mg/kg dose). No drug-related inflammatory adverse events
were identified contrary to PD-1 blocking antibodies [17].

compared with chemotherapy in ipilimumab-refractory
melanoma patients enrolled in phase 2 KEYNOTE-002
trial [128]. Moreover, no clinically meaningful differences
were noted between pembrolizumab doses. In the
randomized phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 trial, pembrolizumab
(10 mg/kg every 2 and 3 weeks) had fewer toxicities and
significantly improved PFS, OS, and ORR compared with
ipilimumab [128]. The ORR of nivolumab treatment in
ipilimumab-refractory patients was lower compared with
ipilimumab-naive patients, while the ORRs of the two
groups were higher than the control group. Subgroup
analyses revealed that the survival benefit was significantly
high with anti-PD-1 treatment regardless of previous
response to ipilimumab treatment, thereby suggesting that
nivolumab or pembrolizumab is a good choice as the firstline treatment [139]. Similarly, the CheckMate 067 trial
demonstrated that combined treatment with ipilimumab
and nivolumab has better ORR compared with nivolumab
monotherapy, especially in PD-L1-positive patients [139,
140]. Collectively, a certain patient population may
selectively respond to anti-PD-1 treatment and benefit
from the combination treatment with anti-CTLA-4 agents
and anti-PD-1 agents.

Clinical trials of mAbs to PD-L1
MPDL3280A is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-L1specific mAb, which is most effective in patients where
the immunity response is suppressed by PD-L1 [134]. In
a phase I MPDL3280A trial, 38 patients with metastatic
melanoma exhibited an ORR of 29% with a 24 week
Progression-Free-Survival (PFS) of 43%. This agent was
expanded in 52 patients with NSCLC and 55 patients
with renal cancer. ORR were 22% and 13%, respectively.
Breakthrough designations have also been granted for the
clinical development of nivolumab for resistant Hodgkin’s
lymphoma and MPDL2380a in advanced bladder cancer
[135].
BMS-936559 is also a PD-L1-specific IgG4 mAb,
which inhibits the binding of PD-L1 with PD-1 and
CD80. A Phase I trial showed good curative effect of
BMS-936559. Up to 207 patients with solid tumor were
treated with BMS-936559 for 12 weeks (median duration
of therapy). Approximately 9% of patients had toxic
effects of grades 3 or 4. Complete or partial response were
showed in 17 patients [136]. A phase II trial has shown
activity in NSCLC patients. Notably, 5 of 49 NSCLC
patients had an objective response, and the response
lasted for ≥24 weeks in 3 patients. In this study, the
adverse reaction belonged to grades 1 or 2, including rash,
hypothyroidism, and hepatitis [137].
MEDI4736 is a fully-human anti-PD-L1 antibody,
which has a triple mutation in its Fc domain to avoid
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [127]. In
a phase I trial, MEDI4736 was administered every 2 or 3
weeks in a 3 + 3 dose escalation in 26 patients with solid
tumors. Grade 1 and 2 adverse events were appeared in
34%. Diarrhea, fatigue, rash, and vomiting are the mainly
side effects [138]. Their research indicated that MEDI4736
was a promising agent to inhibit malignant processes.

CONCLUSIONS
The co-inhibitory factor PD-1 binds to its ligands,
PD-L1 or PD-L2, to transmit inhibitory signals in T cells
and anti-apoptotic signals in tumor cells. Thus, PD-1
binding is characterized as one of the major mechanisms of
tumor immune escape. Furthermore, blockade of the PD-1/
PD-L1 interaction may help restore anti-tumor immunity
by several ways, such as the increase of TILs that restrain
Treg function and increase the cytokine secretion. Some
recent clinical trials on the antibody blockade of PD-1
and PD-L1 also demonstrated effective response. Despite
several previous studies on the important role of PD-1
in inhibiting T-cell activation, the biochemical signaling
effects of PD-1 are yet to be fully understood. Therefore,
further studies on PD-1 are needed. When the checkpoint
PD-1 is better understood, cancer immunotherapy will be
more effective.

Anti-PD-1 versus anti-CTLA-4 agents

The authors report no conflicts of interest.

The anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 treatments are
correlated with clinical benefits. However, cancer patients
trested with anti-PD-1 agents acquire better PFS and
ORR comparied to anti-CTLA-4 treatment. Subgroup
analyses demonstrated significant PFS (RR: 0.92 vs. 0.74;
P < 0.00001) and ORR (RR: 0.95 vs. 0.76; P = 0.0004)
improvement with anti-PD-1 treatment compared with
anti-CTLA-4 when each was compared with the control
treatments [139]. Similarly, treatment with pembrolizumab
was better tolerated and demonstrated superior PFS
