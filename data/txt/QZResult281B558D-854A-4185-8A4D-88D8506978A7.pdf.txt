Abstract
IFN-g promotes tumoral immune surveillance, but its involvement in controlling metastases is less clear.
Using a mouse model of pulmonary metastases, we show that local IFN-g treatment inhibits formation of
metastases through its regulation of IRF-1 in tumor cells. IRF-1 is an IFN-g–induced transcription factor pivotal
in the regulation of infection and inflammation. IRF-1 blockade abolished the inhibitory effect of IFN-g on tumor
metastases, whereas ectopic expression of IRF-1 phenocopied the inhibitory effects of IFN-g. IRF-1 did not affect
the survival of tumor cells in the circulation or their infiltration into lungs, but it was essential to support the
pulmonary attraction and activation of natural killer (NK) cells. Depleting NK cells from mice abolished the
protective effect of IFN-g or IRF-1 on metastases. In addition, cytotoxicity assays revealed that tumor cells
expressing IRF-1 were targeted more effectively by NK cells than IRF-1 nonexpressing tumor cells. Moreover, NK
cells isolated from lungs inoculated with IRF-1–expressing tumor cells exhibit a greater cytotoxic activity.
Mechanistic investigations revealed that IRF-1–induced NK cell cytotoxicity was independent of perforin and
granzyme B but dependent on the NK cell activating receptor DNAM-1. Taken together, our findings establish
IRF-1 as an essential mediator of the cross-talk between tumor cells and NK cells that mediate immune
surveillance in the metastatic niche. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6410–8. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The immune surveillance hypothesis suggests that the
immune system constantly monitors the organism, recognizes, and eradicates abnormal or cancer cells (1). In this
process, cells of the innate and adaptive immunity are involved. Both, NK and T cells are known to induce lysis of target
cells by releasing soluble membrane disrupting proteins such
as perforin and granzyme B or by initiating apoptotic pathways triggered by death receptors (2). IFN-g plays a pivotal
role in promoting antitumor responses. Mice deficient in IFNg or the IFN-g receptor show increased tumor development
and metastases (3). Therefore, IFN-g promotes direct tumor
suppressive effects by inhibiting cellular proliferation (4),
promoting apoptosis by upregulation of caspases, CD95 or

TRAIL (5), inhibiting angiogenesis (6), and promoting host
antitumor immunity by enforced expression of MHC molecules or components involved in antigen processing.
One of the intracellular targets of IFN-g is IRF-1, a transcriptional activator. IRF-1 is induced by IFN-g and other
cytokines like type I IFNs, TNF-a, (IL)-1, IL-6, platelet-derived
growth factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
factor, dsRNA viruses, and genotoxic stress (7). Studies on
IRF-1 knockout mice revealed that IRF-1 favors T-cell differentiation into helper T cells and its involvement in the
differentiation and function of NK cells (8, 9). IRF-1 exerts
a variety of biologic processes including inflammation, antiviral response, immune regulation, and tumor suppression.
The efficiency of IRF-1 in tumor suppression in mice was first
observed due to its ability to revert IRF-2–induced transformation of NIH3T3 cells and the inhibition of tumor formation
in nude mice (10). Furthermore, the role of IRF-1 in immune
responses was shown by the induction of antitumoral immune
responses mediated by CD4þ and CD8þ T cells (11). Tumorsuppressive functions of IRF-1 are exhibited by the induction
of target genes involved in cell-cycle control or apoptotic
processes (12). Interestingly, deletion of IRF-1 alone does
not promote tumorigenesis. However, it enhances the extent
of tumors arising from p53 deletions (13).
On the basis of the hypothesis that stimulation of the
intrinsic activity of IRF-1 upon IFN-g addition should induce
antitumor activities, we administered IFN-g to mice with
experimental pulmonary lung metastases. Intranasal application was able to inhibit the development of metastases,
whereas this effect was partially reverted by suppression of

IRF-1 Expression Activates NK Cells

IRF-1 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA). We show that the IRF-1–
mediated repression of lung metastases is dependent on NK
cells. Systemic analysis revealed that IRF-1 expression influences the tumor microenvironment by the expression of
CXCL11, which results in the attraction of CXCR3-positive
NK cells. Evidence is provided that the IRF-1–mediated protective effect on lungs is mediated by an upregulation of
TRAIL and DNAX accessory molecule 1 (DNAM-1) on NK
cells and of CD155 and DR5 on tumor cells.

Materials and Methods
Mice
All experiments were done with 8- to 12-week-old mice.
Balb/c mice were purchased from Harlan. IFNAR1/
mice (14) on Balb/c background were kept under specific
pathogen-free conditions at German Cancer Research Centre.
Rag2gc/ and NMRInu/nu mice were bred under specific
pathogen-free conditions at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research. All animal experiments were done according to
the guidelines of the ethics committee of Landesamt f€
ur
Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit of Lower Saxony. Mice were treated with 2 mg/mL doxycycline in the
drinking water. Water was changed every second day. Recombinant mouse IFN-g (peripheral blood lymphocytes) was
administered intranasally.
Cell lines
CT26 colon carcinoma cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Authentication of cells was
confirmed by nanoplex PCR by the German Biological Resource Centre. Cells were stably transfected with pVBC3HA to
express hemagglutinin from Influenza virus PR38 to generate
CT26HA cells. CT26HA cells were infected with recombinant
lentiviruses containing the IRF-1 gene under the control of the
tetracycline promoter to generate CT26HA/IRF-1 cells. Cells
were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (Lonza) and 1%
(v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). IRF-1 expression was induced by the addition of doxycycline to the medium
(2 mg/mL). IRF-1 shRNA oligos were cloned into pHR-SIN-SEW
(15): IRF1/1_CAACATGTCTTCACGGAGATCTCTTGAATCTCCGTGAAGACATGTTG, IRF1/2_GCACTAAATGAGTCCTATTTCTCTTGAAAATAGGACTCATTTAGTGC, and IRF1/
3_TGGCTAGAGATGCAGATTATCTCTTGAATAATCTGCATCTCTAGCCA. Infected cells were sorted for GFP expression and subjected to animal experiments.
Experimental metastases model
To examine metastatic tumor growth, mice were inoculated
i.v. with 5  105 CT26HA or CT26HA/IRF-1 colon carcinoma
cells. Lungs were isolated and analyzed as described.
Flow cytometry
Single-cell suspension of lungs was generated by collagenase/dispase (0.2 mg/mL) and DNaseI (0.02 mg/mL; Roche)
digestion. Analysis of single cells was done with the LSR II (BD
Bioscience). CD4þ:anti-CD4, CD8þ:anti-CD8, NK cells:anti-

Biolegend, and BD Bioscience.
NK cell depletion
For depletion of NK cells, mice received 50 mg monoclonal
anti–asialo-GM1 (Wako Chemicals) by intraperitoneal (i.p.)
administration on day 10, 5, 0, 6, and 10. Efficiency of NK
cell depletion was more than 95% in blood, spleen, and lungs
monitored by CD3NKp46þ staining.
Transwell assays
Tumor cells were seeded in a 24-transwell assay plate
(Costar) with a pore size of 3 or 5 mm and treated with
doxycycline or left untreated. NK cells, sorted from spleen
or lungs, were seeded in the upper chamber. Five, 24, and 48
hours after seeding migration rate and activation status of NK
cells were determined.
RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and
reverse transcribed with Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand
Beads (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative real-time PCR
(RT-PCR) analysis was done with a LightCycler (Roche) and
the Quantitect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen). The data are
represented as ratios relative to the values of actin. Standard
curve analysis was done for relative quantification. Actin-for_
TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC, actin-rev_TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG, muCXCL11-for_AGTAACGGCTGCGACAAAGT; muCXCL11-rev_GCATGTTCCAAGACAGCAGA.
Cytotoxicity assay
NK cells were isolated from spleen or lungs. Tumor cells were
stained with CFSE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and incubated for 4 hours with NK cells in the
indicated effector:target ratio 7-AAD was added and cells were
analyzed. Percentage of killing was calculated from the ratio of
living CFSEþ and dead CFSEþ/7-AADþ tumor cells. Involvement of specific NK cell was by treatment with 20 mg/mL of
DNAM-1 blocking antibodies.

Results
Local IFN-g administration inhibits pulmonary
metastases formation
Tumor cells injected i.v. into syngenic Balb/c mice attach on
pulmonary vessel walls and form tumors, a procedure that
simulates the late steps of metastases. To examine the influence of local IFN-g administration on metastasis formation,
we used CT26HA cells expressing hemagglutinin (HA) as a
model tumor antigen. Expression of HA had no influence on
immunogenicity of the tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Murine IFN-g was administered by the intranasal route.
Metastases in the IFN-g–treated mice were significantly decreased (Fig. 1A).

Figure 1. Inhibition of metastasis formation by IFN-g is dependent on IRF1. Mice were i.v. injected with 5  105 tumor cells and were treated with
PBS or IFN-g intranasally every day. Three weeks after tumor cell injection,
tumor foci in the lungs were counted. Data show the mean number of lung
nodules  SD and represent 1 of 3 experiments. A, CT26HA cells (n ¼ 15)

*, P < 0.05.

One of the key mediators of IFN-g–induced effects is IRF-1.
To investigate whether IRF-1 expression in the tumor cells is
responsible for the IFN-g–mediated tumor-suppressive effect,
IRF-1 expression was downregulated by shRNAs in CT26HA
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Mice inoculated with these cells
showed no significant decrease in lung metastasis formation
upon IFN-g treatment (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that IFNg–induced inhibition of metastases is mediated by the expression of IRF-1.
IRF-1 decreases metastatic tumor growth and prolongs
survival of mice
Overexpression of IRF-1 inhibits proliferation, reverses
transformation (16), and induces tumor-specific immune
responses (11, 17). To determine the mechanisms of IRF-1
on metastasis formation, we generated a CT26HA tumor cell
line expressing IRF-1 under the control of a tetracyclinedependent promoter (CT26HA/IRF-1). IRF-1 was only slightly
induced upon doxycycline treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Induction of IRF-1 in this cell line did not influence
proliferation or transformation (Supplementary Fig. S3B and
C), but mice inoculated with IRF-1–expressing tumor cells
showed significantly increased survival rates (Fig. 2A). Development of lung metastases was analyzed 3 weeks after tumor
cell inoculation. A significant decrease of lung colonies was
found in mice inoculated with IRF-1–expressing tumor cells
(Fig. 2B and C). This indicates that IRF-1 expression inhibits
experimental lung metastases and prolongs survival.
IRF-1 negatively influences initiation and maintenance
of metastases
Inhibition of metastases could be due to reduced survival
in circulation or by retarding initiation of micrometastases
in the lungs. To define the level of inhibition, IRF-1 induction
was initiated at different time points to tumor cell inoculation. The number of metastases was reduced in all animals

independent of the time point of IRF-1 induction (Fig. 2D).
This observation indicates that IRF-1 expression reduces
development of metastatic nodules in the lungs rather than
affecting the survival of the cells in circulation or their
settling in the lungs.
IRF-1 initiates NK cell accumulation in metastatic lungs
As IRF-1 expression had no direct growth inhibitory effect
on the tumor cells, we assumed that immune cells might be
involved and analyzed immune cell populations of the
metastatic lungs (Fig. 3A and B). No significant differences
between IRF-1 induced and noninduced lungs were observed
in the number of tumor-infiltrating granulocytes. The percentage of macrophages and dendritic cells was decreased
upon IRF-1 expression. Interestingly, IRF-1 induction led to a
significantly higher percentage of NK cells in metastatic
lungs.
Previous work with s.c. tumor models showed that tumor
suppression by IRF-1 was mainly dependent on CD8þ and
CD4þ T cells (11, 17). In the pulmonary lung metastasis
model, the number of CD8þ T cells is not significantly altered
by IRF-1 expression, but the number of CD4þ T cells is
increased (Fig. 3B). Further analysis revealed no change in
the Treg cell subset (CD4þCD25þFoxP3) of CD4þ T cells
(Fig. 3C).

Figure 3. IRF-1 induced alteration of immune cells in lung tissue.
Balb/c mice received CT26HA/IRF-1 cells via tail vein injection. Mice were
treated with doxycycline (þ Dox) or left untreated ( Dox). Three weeks
after tumor cell injection lungs were removed and single-cell suspensions
from whole lungs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Percentage of cells in
the lungs are shown: A, myeloid cells, granulocytes (Gr), Macrophages
(Ma), B cells (BC), NK cells, and dendritic cells (DC); B, T and B

1 of 3 independent experiments (n ¼ 15;  SD). *, P < 0.05.

NK cells are essential for IRF-1–mediated metastases
inhibition
Elimination of tumor cells could be T-cell dependent. To
investigate whether the decreased number of lung metastases
by IRF-1 was T-cell dependent, we inoculated T-cell–deficient
nude mice with CT26HA/IRF-1 tumor cells and determined
the effect of IRF-1 induction on tumor burden. The effect of
IRF-1 was comparable with that of wild-type mice (Fig. 4A).
Thus, T lymphocytes are not responsible for the IRF-1–dependent restriction of metastases.
NK cells are known to be responsive to tumor cells. We
therefore used Rag2gc/ mice to determine the impact of
NK cells on IRF-1–mediated inhibition of metastases
(Fig. 4B). Induction of IRF-1 by doxycycline treatment did
not lead to a reduction in metastasis formation, suggesting
that NK cells are involved in IRF-1–mediated inhibition of
tumor development.
To further clarify the role of NK cells, we depleted NK cells
using anti–asialo-GM1 antibody (Fig. 4C). Mice depleted of NK

cells showed enhanced metastasis development, regardless
of IRF-1 expression (Fig. 4D). We conclude that NK cells
are involved in IRF-1–mediated inhibition of metastases
development.
Expression of IRF-1 in the tumor cells attracts and
activates NK cells
To analyze whether induction of IRF-1 leads to the activation of NK cells, CD69 expression was assessed on lung NK
cells. The number of NK cells was not altered, but frequency of
NK cells expressing high levels of CD69 was significantly
enriched in lungs of mice inoculated with tumors expressing
IRF-1 (Fig. 5A). Using transwells which prevent contact between NK and tumor cells, we could show that soluble factors
produced by IRF-1–expressing tumor cells induce activation
of NK cells (Fig. 5B). This effect is even stronger when NK cells
migrate through the membrane and are in direct contact with
the IRF-1–expressing tumor cells (Fig. 5C).
The CXCR3 binding chemokine CXCL11 is known to attract
NK cells. RT-PCR analysis of lungs revealed that CXCL11
mRNA was much more abundant if IRF-1 expression in the
tumor cells had been induced (Fig. 5D). In addition, the
frequency of tumor-infiltrating NK cells expressing the corresponding receptor CXCR3 was increased in mice upon IRF-1
induction (Fig. 5E), suggesting that expression of IRF-1 leads
to the secretion of CXCL11 and attraction of NK cells via its
activity on the CXCR3 receptor.

Figure 5. Role of IRF-1 expression in NK cell activation and attraction. Mice received CT26HA/IRF-1 cells via tail vein injection and were treated with

mean number of lung nodules  SD and are representative for 2 independent experiments (n > 10). *, P < 0.05. **, P < 0.01.

Retardation of tumor growth by IRF-1 is independent of
type I IFN
Type I IFNs are critical for controlling NK cell–mediated
antitumor responses (18). To investigate the role of type I IFN
in IRF-1–mediated tumor suppression and NK cell activation,
metastasis formation was investigated in IFNAR1/ mice.
Mice treated with doxycycline to induce IRF-1 expression
showed a significant decrease in the number of tumor nodules
compared with the untreated controls (Fig. 5F). No differences
were detectable between the IFNAR/ animals and the
heterozygous controls, indicating that type I IFN plays no
role in NK cell-mediated inhibition of metastases upon IRF-1
expression.
NK cell cytotoxicity and sensitivity of tumor cells to NK
cell–mediated killing is increased by IRF-1
The contact of IRF-1–expressing tumor cells with NK
cells leads to a strong activation of NK cells. We investigated if expression of IRF-1 renders CT26HA/IRF-1 tumor
cells susceptible to NK-cell cytotoxicity. In vitro activated
spleenic NK cells show higher lytic activity against
CT26HA/IRF-1 tumor cells expressing IRF-1 compared
with nonexpressing tumor cells (Fig. 6A). In addition, NK
cells isolated from lungs of mice harboring IRF-1–expressing tumors showed increased cytotoxicity to Raji cells
compared with NK cells from noninduced animals

(Fig. 6B). The data reveal that IRF-1 induction increases
the sensitivity of tumor cells to NK cell-mediated killing
and leads to a higher cytotoxic capacity of NK cells. NK cell
responses against tumor cells are mediated by cytokine
release, activating or inhibitory receptors. Production of
IFN-g, perforin, or granzyme B by NK cells was not affected
by IRF-1 expression (data not shown) and neutralization of
IFN-g did not influence the effects of IRF-1 on metastasis
formation (Fig. 6C). Surface protein analysis revealed that
the effect of IRF-1 does not influence the expression of
death receptor Fas, or the NKG2D ligands Rae-1 or H60.
However, surface expression of MHC class I molecules,
death receptor DR5 and the adhesion molecule CD155,
was increased (Fig. 6D). Analysis of tumor-infiltrating
NK cells revealed that IRF-1 induction had no influence
on NKG2D and FasL expression (Fig. 6E). However, increased expression levels of the death receptor ligand
TRAIL and the adhesion molecule DNAM-1 were detectable
on tumor-infiltrating NK cells after IRF-1 induction
(Fig. 6E).
NK cell-mediated killing of IRF-1 expressing tumor cells
is dependent on DNAM-1
DNAM-1 and TRAIL play an important role in elimination
of tumor cells. To investigate the role of DNAM-1 in NK cell–
mediated cytotoxicity, we blocked DNAM-1 by antibodies.

Figure 6. Influence of IRF-1 expression on NK cell cytotoxicity. A, CT26HA/IRF-1 cells were treated with doxycycline (þ Dox) or left untreated ( Dox)
for 24 hours and susceptibility to IL-2–activated spleenic NK cells was determined for the indicated E:T ratios (n ¼ 3) and represents 1 of 3 experiments.
B, lung NK cells were isolated 3 weeks after mice received CT26HA/IRF-1 cells i.v. and were treated with (þ Dox) or without doxycycline ( Dox). NK cell
cytotoxicity against Raji cells was measured for the indicated E:T ratios (n ¼ 5). C, Balb/c mice were i.p. injected with anti-IFN-g antibody or PBS on day
0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. CT26HA/IRF-1 cells were injected i.v. at day 0 and treated with (þ Dox) or without doxycycline ( Dox). Number of lung nodules
was counted 18 days after tumor cell injection. Data show the mean number of lung nodules  SD (n ¼ 5). D, CT26HA/IRF-1 cells were treated
with doxycycline (þ Dox) or left untreated ( Dox) for 24 hours and surface expression was analyzed (n ¼ 3). Data represent 1 of 3 independent experiments.
E, mice received CT26HA/IRF-1 cells via tail vein injection and were treated with doxycycline (þ Dox) or left untreated ( Dox). Three weeks after tumor
cell injection lungs were isolated and surface expression of NKp46þ NK cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are representative of 2 independent
experiments (n ¼ 10). *, P < 0.05.

Cytotoxicity of lung NK cells from doxycycline-treated mice
was partially inhibited (Fig. 7A). Analysis of tumor cells
isolated from lungs of IRF-1–induced mice showed decreased frequencies of DR5þ and CD155þ tumor cells compared with nontreated animals (Fig. 7B). To test whether
DNAM-1 and TRAIL-dependent mechanisms could be responsible for IRF-1–mediated inhibition of metastases, we
inoculated tumor cells in DNAM-1/ mice and wild-type
mice treated with TRAIL-blocking antibodies. IRF-1–mediated inhibition of metastases was completely abolished in
DNAM1/ mice (Fig. 7C), whereas blockage of TRAIL
resulted only in partial but not complete reduction of
metastases (Fig. 7D). These data indicate that NK cell–
mediated elimination of tumors by IRF-1 is dependent on
DNAM-1 and partially on TRAIL.
To test whether expression of CD155 and DR5 leads to
recognition and elimination of only CD155hiDR5hi tumor cells
by NK cells we treated CT26HA/IRF-1 cells with doxycycline
for 2 days and sorted CD155lowDR5low cells. Inoculation into
mice resulted in a lesser reduction of metastases by IRF-1 in
mice injected with CD155lowDR5low cells compared with unsorted controls (Fig. 7E). Taken together, these findings indicate that IRF-1–mediated elimination of tumor cells results
from DR5 and CD155 expression on tumor cells.

Discussion
IRF-1 exhibits powerful tumor-suppressive effects in different animal models (11, 17, 19). Both intrinsic and systemic
responses including adaptive immunity have been linked to
IRF-1–induced tumor suppression (11, 12, 16). Here, we show
that neither intrinsic nor adaptive effects but innate defense
mechanisms play a key role in IRF-1 induced inhibition of lung
metastases.
Earlier reports have shown that systemic treatment of mice
with high doses of IFN-g led to a partial reduction of lung
metastases by a macrophage-dependent mechanism (20). We
show that local administration of IFN-g leads to a potent
inhibition of lung metastases (Fig. 1A) and that IRF-1 is a
major player of IFN-g–mediated inhibition of metastases,
shown by downregulation of IRF-1 (Fig. 1B) and ectopic
expression of low IRF-1 concentrations (Fig. 2).
Ectopic expression of IRF-1 in tumor cells shows inhibition of proliferation and tumorigenicity (16, 21). These
effects are mediated by the inhibition of cell-cycle progression or induction of apoptosis and require comparably high
levels of IRF-1 protein (11). In this report, IRF-1 is expressed
at very low levels and is not able to inhibit proliferation and
anchorage-independent growth of CT26HA cells in vitro

Figure 7. DNAM-1 is critical for NK cell-mediated killing of IRF-1–
expressing tumor cells. Mice received CT26HA/IRF-1 cells i.v. and were
treated with (þ Dox) or without doxycycline ( Dox). After 3 weeks, lungs
were isolated and analyzed. A, NK cells were purified from lungs and lysis
of Raji cells was measured in the absence or presence of DNAM-1
blocking antibodies for the indicated E:T ratios (n ¼ 5). B, HAþ tumor cells
were analyzed for surface expression of CD155 and DR5 expression by
flow cytometry. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments
(n ¼ 10). Mice were injected i.v. with CT26HA/IRF-1 cells and treated with
doxycycline (þ Dox) or left untreated ( Dox). C, 3 weeks after tumor cell
injection, the number of lung nodules was determined in
DNAM-1/ mice. D, wild-type mice were i.p. injected with anti-TRAIL
antibody on days 5, 0, 6, and 10. Data show the mean number of lung
nodules  SD and are representative of 2 independent experiments
(n > 10). E, CT26HA/IRF-1 tumor cells were treated for 2 days with
doxycycline. DR5lowCD155low tumor cells were sorted and i.v. injected into
Balb/c mice. Mice were treated with doxycycline (þ Dox) or left untreated
( Dox). Three weeks after tumor cell injection, the number of
lung nodules was determined. Data show the mean number of lung
nodules  SD (n ¼ 5). *, P < 0.05.

(Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, it is unlikely that IRF-1
prevents metastases by a direct antiproliferative effect on
tumor cells in vivo. Comparison of cell populations in the
metastatic lungs in the absence or presence of ectopic IRF-1
revealed differences in the magnitude of CD4þ T cells, B
cells, dendritic cells and NK cells (Fig. 3). The role of NK cells
as a major effector cell population gained further support by

the use of mutant mouse strains and depletion experiments
(Figs. 3 and 4) showing that a host response mediated by NK
cells in particular is necessary for the tumoricidal effect,
whereas T and B cells are dispensable.
NK cells are important mediators of antitumor immunity.
Mice with decreased levels of NK cells have increased susceptibility to experimental lung metastases and tumor growth (22).
Chemokines like the CXCR3 ligands play important roles in NK
cell migration (23). IFN-g and IRF-1 induce CXCR3 ligands
CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (24). Our data show that ectopic
expression of IRF-1 induces the expression of CXCL11 (Fig. 5E)
and lung tumor-infiltrating NK cells express CXCR3 (Fig. 6B).
Type I IFN has an important role in immune surveillance
and in restricting growth of transplantable tumors (25),
including lung metastases (18). NK cell activation and cytotoxicity is induced by type I IFN (26). IRF-1 was identified as an
inducer of IFN-b (27). Our data reveal that IRF-1–mediated NK
cell activation by IFN-b is unlikely, as IFNAR/ mice showed
unaltered reduction of metastatic lung nodules (Fig. 5F).
In addition, cytoplasmic granule toxins and IFN-g released
by NK cells are identified for their essential role in tumor
killing (28–30) are not involved in the IRF-1–mediated effect of
metastases reduction. We found no influence of granzyme B or
IFN-g production in tumor-residing NK cells by IRF-1. NK cells
can control liver metastases by TRAIL-mediated induction of
apoptosis through binding to DR5 on the tumor cells (31).
Doxycycline-treated mice show significantly higher amounts
of tumor-residing TRAILþ NK cells and lower numbers of
DR5þ tumor cells in the lungs (Fig. 7B). However, metastases
are still decreased in mice treated with TRAIL-blocking antibodies, which is indicative of a minor role of TRAIL in the IRF1–mediated inhibition of metastases.
NK cells recognize and eliminate cells through a complex
set of activating and inhibiting receptors (32–34). MHC class I
molecules on CT26HA cells were induced rather than downregulated by IRF-1, suggesting that NK cell activation by the
lack of "self" signals is unlikely. Thus, IRF-1 may tip the balance
between activating and inhibitory signals toward activation by
other mechanisms. Earlier studies indicated that expression of
NKG2D ligands results in NK cell–mediated tumor cell killing
even when the tumor cells express normal levels of MHC
molecules (35, 36). However, expression of NKG2D ligands
Rae-1 or H60 was not found to be altered by IRF-1 (Fig. 6D).
Another activating receptor, DNAM-1, was recently reported
to play an important role in tumor immune surveillance by NK
cells (37, 38). DNAM-1 binds to CD155 and CD112, both of
which have been found to be upregulated in tumors (37).
DNAM-1 participates in the NK cell–mediated lysis of certain
tumor cells in collaboration with NK cell receptors (39, 40).
Furthermore, DNAM-1 expression on NK cells is sufficient to
eliminate tumor cells that lack expression of ligands for
NKG2D or other NK cell–activating receptors (41, 42). Antibody-mediated blocking of DNAM-1 decreases cytotoxicity of
NK cells, whereas DNAM-1/ mice are not able to control
metastases upon IRF-1 expression. We found significantly
lower numbers of CD155þ tumor cells in metastatic lungs
upon IRF-1 induction (Fig. 7B) which could be the result of NK
cell–mediated killing of the tumor cells. Thus, DNAM-1 plays

IRF-1 Expression Activates NK Cells

an important role in NK cell–mediated killing of tumor cells
that express IRF-1. IRF-1 expression in tumor cells recruits
and activates NK cells which promote destruction of transformed cells by a DNAM-1–dependent mechanism. However,
IRF-1 expression does not inhibit metastasis formation
completely. As depicted in Fig. 2A, all mice died within
10 weeks despite the protective effect of IRF-1. Injection of
sorted CD155lowDR5low tumor cells revealed that tumor cells
which can escape NK cell–mediated killing are not controlled
by IRF-1 (Fig. 7E).
Overall, our study shows that IRF-1 is a key mediator of
IFN-g. Numerous studies indicate that different types of
inflammatory reactions and individual proinflammatory cytokines lead to strong induction of IRF-1 (7). Because we have
shown that even low expression of IRF-1 is sufficient to inhibit
metastasis development and prolonged survival, IRF-1 induction by proinflammatory cytokines or small molecules is an
attractive target for cancer therapy.
