ABSTRACT
Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is primarily an androgen-dependent disease,
which is treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Tumors usually develop
resistance (castration-resistant PCa [CRPC]), but remain androgen receptor (AR)
dependent. Numerous mechanisms for AR-dependent resistance have been identified
including expression of constitutively active AR splice variants lacking the hormonebinding domain. Recent clinical studies show that expression of the best-characterized
AR variant, AR-V7, correlates with resistance to ADT and poor outcome. Whether ARV7 is simply a constitutively active substitute for AR or has novel gene targets that
cause unique downstream changes is unresolved. Several studies have shown that
AR activation alters cell metabolism. Using LNCaP cells with inducible expression of
AR-V7 as a model system, we found that AR-V7 stimulated growth, migration, and
glycolysis measured by ECAR (extracellular acidification rate) similar to AR. However,
further analyses using metabolomics and metabolic flux assays revealed several
differences. Whereas AR increased citrate levels, AR-V7 reduced citrate mirroring
metabolic shifts observed in CRPC patients. Flux analyses indicate that the low citrate
is a result of enhanced utilization rather than a failure to synthesize citrate. Moreover,
flux assays suggested that compared to AR, AR-V7 exhibits increased dependence on
glutaminolysis and reductive carboxylation to produce some of the TCA (tricarboxylic
acid cycle) metabolites. These findings suggest that these unique actions represent
potential therapeutic targets.

INTRODUCTION

progression of PCa [2]. AR consists of four functional
domains: an amino-terminal transactivation domain
(encoded by exon 1), a DNA-binding domain (DBD
encoded by exons 2 and 3), a hinge region (H encoded
by the 5’ portion of exon 4), and a ligand-binding domain
(LBD encoded by the remainder of exon 4 through exon
8) (Figure 1A) [3]. Since AR is the main therapeutic target

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly
diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer and the second-leading
cause of cancer-related death in men in the Unites States
[1]. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role both
in the development of the normal prostate and in the

in PCa, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the firstline of treatment for metastatic disease. Although this
therapy is initially successful, tumors recur and are termed
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC is often
characterized by an aberrant reactivation of AR through
several mechanisms including expression of constitutively
active AR splice variants, which lack hormone binding
domains and are thus resistant to ADT [1, 4, 5].
The best-characterized variant is AR-V7 (also
termed AR3), which contains exons 1-3 followed by 16
unique amino acids from a cryptic exon 3b [6, 7]. This
variant has been detected in CRPC tissue samples and in
some cell lines. Although the activities and contributions
of variants are still largely unknown, two recent clinical
trials show that expression of AR-V7 in tumors correlates
with resistance to the anti-androgen, enzalutamide (i.e.
MDV3100) and to the CYP17A1 inhibitor, abiraterone,
which further reduces levels of androgens [8, 9]. Previous
studies have shown that AR-V7 induces PCa cell growth
in the absence of androgens, regulates some canonical AR
target genes, as well as regulating unique sets of genes [6,
10-12]. However, the biological consequences of unique
alterations in gene expression have not been determined
and some of these actions may be therapeutic targets.
One known action of AR is to alter metabolism.
Several studies have shown that AR signaling stimulates
aerobic glycolysis, lipid metabolism, and several anabolic
processes in PCa [13-17]. However, there is currently
no information on what, if any, role AR-V7 plays in
regulating these metabolic pathways. Cancer cells have the
ability to alter their cell metabolism to produce compounds
to sustain their accelerated growth (Warburg effect) [18].
This phenomenon of metabolic reprogramming has
emerged as a hallmark of many cancers [19], and this is a
complex, multivariable process.
A majority of metabolic cancer research to date has
focused on the role of glycolysis. Increased glycolysis
yields more metabolic intermediates to fuel several
anabolic processes to produce more building blocks
(i.e. amino acids, nucleotides, lipids) for the cells to
proliferate rapidly [20]. However, other studies have
highlighted the importance of several other key metabolic
pathways including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
and glutamine metabolism (i.e. glutaminolysis) in many
cancers [21, 22]. Cancer cells often have increased
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and elevated uptake
and consumption of glutamine [23, 24]. Many cancer cells
become addicted to glutamine since it is readily available
in high amounts in the circulation and is actively taken up
by the cells [25, 26]. Glutamine contributes nitrogen and
carbon to many biosynthetic reactions generating lipids
and nucleotides. Moreover, glutaminolysis regulates redox
homeostasis and modulates the activity of several signal
transduction pathways [27, 28].
Previous studies have also integrated metabolic
profiling with genomic studies in LNCaP cells to identify
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

transcriptional networks with AR serving as a critical
regulator of metabolism [17, 29, 30]. AR regulates key
genes involved in cell cycle, glucose metabolism, lipid
metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and amino-acid
metabolism [13]. In addition, AR increases glycolysis
in PCa cells [13, 16]. To compare the actions of AR and
AR-V7, we have employed an inducible AR-V7 model
derived from LNCaP cells and have combined steady
state metabolomics with metabolic flux studies and gene
expression to assess the contributions of AR and AR-V7
to metabolism in PCa cells.

RESULTS
AR-V7 induces AR target gene expression, cell
growth, and migration
To characterize the functions of AR-V7 in PCa, we
generated an LNCaP cell line with doxycycline (Dox)
inducible expression of AR-V7 (LNCaP-AR-V7-pHage).
AR-V7 lacks the hinge region and LBD found in fulllength AR while retaining the NTD and DBD followed
by 16 unique amino acids from a cryptic exon 3b (Figure
1A). We induced expression of AR-V7 to similar levels
as hormone-stabilized AR (R1881) for our experiments
(Figure 1B). Similar to R1881, AR-V7 also induced
expression of typical AR target genes, FKBP5 and PSA
(Figure 1C). Moreover, R1881 and AR-V7 both increased
cell growth and migration (Figure 1D and 1E).

Both AR isoforms increase glycolysis
Previous studies have shown that activation of AR
with R1881 increased glycolysis [13, 16]. To determine
whether AR-V7 also increases glycolysis, a Seahorse assay
was done to measure ECAR (extracellular acidification
rate), a measure of glycolysis. Similar to R1881 treatment,
induction of AR-V7 increased ECAR (Figure 2A and 2B).
The isoforms respond similarly with respect to ECAR
when treated with the mitochondrial inhibitors, FCCP
and rotenone. In parallel, although there was a trend for
increased OCR (oxygen consumption rate) in AR-V7
expressing cells, there was no significant difference for
either isoform relative to vehicle (Figure 2C) consistent
with results of an earlier AR study by Massie et al., 2011
[13].

levels of metabolites

shows that cells utilize both glucose through glycolysis to

to produce α-ketoglutarate, both of which can feed the
TCA cycle to generate precursors essential for other
key biochemical pathways. To more broadly assess
the effects of AR and AR-V7 on metabolism, steady
state levels of approximately 100 metabolites including
glycolytic intermediates, TCA cycle components, amino
acids, and some nucleotides were measured using liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A heat
map of the metabolites regulated by one or both of the
AR isoforms revealed that AR and AR-V7 regulate a
majority of the metabolites in a similar manner although
not always to the same extent (Figure 3B). However, there
were some key differences particularly in the TCA cycle.
Consistent with both isoforms stimulating glycolysis, both
AR and AR-V7 decreased glucose/fructose and 3PG/2PG
(3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate) levels, but
increased pyruvate levels (Figure 4A). In contrast, AR and
AR-V7 differentially regulated levels of the TCA cycle
metabolites. AR increased the steady state levels of all
of the TCA cycle intermediates while AR-V7 decreased

levels of some metabolites but increased the levels of
others (Figure 4B). The alterations in the steady state
levels of citrate were particularly striking with hormone
treatment increasing the levels of this metabolite while
AR-V7 dramatically reduced citrate levels. In contrast,
α-ketoglutarate (AKG) and oxaloacetate (OAA) were
increased by both AR-V7 and AR. Furthermore, both
isoforms increased the steady state levels of glutamine
(Figure 4C) and AKG (Figure 4B) suggesting potential
regulation of glutaminolysis. The striking difference
observed in the in vitro citrate levels is consistent with
patient tumor derived metabolomics data. Citrate levels
are high in the normal prostate and in androgen-dependent
PCa but are low in CRPC tumors, which frequently
express AR-V7 (Figure 5A and 5B).

utilization. To distinguish these possibilities, flux analyses
were performed. [U-13C]-glucose labeled metabolic
flux analysis was employed to analyze AR isoformspecific progression through glycolysis. In this labeling
scheme depicted in Figure 6A, glucose-derived glucose6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), and
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) were detected as an
m+6 isotopomer retaining all six labeled carbons. Citrate
is detected as multiple isotopomers (m+2, m+3, m+4,
and m+6) indicating flow of glucose-derived carbon
through multiple rounds of glycolysis. After 3 hours of
[U-13C]-glucose labeling, isotopomer analysis revealed
that glucose consumption via glycolysis was increased in
AR-V7 expressing cells. In particular, expression of ARV7 corresponded to a statistically significant increase in
glycolytic intermediates: G6P F6P (m+6) and FBP (m+6)
as well as elevated incorporation of glucose-derived
carbon pool into citrate (m+2, m+4) (Figure 6B, 6C, and
6D). The AR-V7 mediated increase in 13C-labeled citrate
metabolites suggests that reduced levels of this metabolite
seen using steady state metabolomics is likely a result of
increased utilization of citrate rather than a perturbation
in its synthesis.
All of the measured TCA cycle intermediates were
elevated by AR in our steady state metabolomics analysis.
Whereas citrate, α-ketoglutarate (AKG), fumarate, malate,
and oxaloacetate (OAA) were increased by AR, only AKG
and OAA were increased by AR-V7 (Figure 3B and 4B).
Analysis of the mRNAs for the enzymes responsible for
the conversion of AKG to succinyl-CoA and CO2 [31]
and the conversion of malate to OAA [32] revealed that
they are differentially regulated by the AR isoforms.
Hormone treatment to activate AR decreased levels of
malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1) and increased levels
of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) (Figure 7A).
This favors the accumulation of malate and fumarate,
respectively. Conversely, AR-V7 increased levels of
MDH1 and decreased OGDH. This gene regulation
is consistent with the steady-state metabolomics data.
Increased MDH1 supports increased conversion of
malate to OAA, which was high in AR-V7 expressing
cells. Moreover, decreased OGDH supports decreased
conversion of AKG whose levels are also high in AR-V7
cells.
We next used [U-13C]-glucose metabolic flux
analysis to examine AR isoform-specific progression
through the canonical TCA cycle. In this labeling scheme
depicted in Figure 7B, TCA cycle intermediates could be
detected through several cycle progressions. In the first
round, the TCA cycle would begin with two carbons of
citrate labeled and progress through the cycle ending with
late TCA cycle intermediates (i.e. malate and fumarate)
also having two carbons labeled. These are detected by the
mass spectrometer as m+2 isotopomers. The subsequent
cycles would produce m+3 and then m+4 isotopomers.
After 3 hours of [U-13C]-glucose labeling, isotopomer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

analysis revealed that glucose utilization via the TCA
cycle was increased in hormone treated but not in AR-V7
expressing cells. In particular, R1881 increased levels of
late TCA cycle intermediates: fumarate (m+3) and malate
(m+3) (Figure 7C and 7D). Although Tennakoon et al. [16]
have previously reported increased steady state levels of
TCA metabolites in response to R1881, to our knowledge
this is the first analysis showing R1881 accelerated flux
through the canonical TCA cycle.

AR-V7 enhances glutamine metabolism via
reductive carboxylation
The TCA cycle generates several metabolic
intermediates that feed multiple biosynthetic pathways to
produce lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins essential for cell
growth [33]. However, in many cancer cells, glutamine
metabolism is utilized to generate energy and metabolic
intermediates for the rapidly growing cells [34,35].
Therefore, we examined AR isoform-specific metabolic
flux through canonical and reductive carboxylation of
glutamine. [5-13C]-glutamine and [1-13C]-glutamine
metabolic flux analyses were employed to analyze AR
isoform-specific utilization of reductive carboxylation
(Figure 8A). When using [5-13C]-glutamine, the fifth
carbon of glutamine is labeled. Thus, the m+1 isotopomers
of the TCA cycle intermediates can be derived through
either the canonical TCA cycle or reductive carboxylation.
Consistent with this, after 3 hours of [5-13C]-glutamine
labeling, isotopomer analysis revealed that both AR and
AR-V7 significantly increased the m+1 isotopomer of
fumarate (Figure 8D). Additionally, AR-V7 significantly
increased the levels of citrate (m+1) (Figure 8B). This
suggests that both receptors can generate these metabolites
either through the canonical TCA cycle or from utilization
of reductive carboxylation. In order to further understand
the extent of utilization of glutamine-derived carbon
via canonical versus reductive carboxylation routes, we
performed [1-13C]-glutamine metabolic flux analyses.
Here, only the first carbon of glutamine is labeled (Figure
8E) and thus, the intermediates generated by canonical
functioning of the TCA cycle will remain unlabeled (since
the first carbon of AKG is lost as CO2 during its conversion
to succinyl CoA). In contrast, if the cells utilized reductive
carboxylation, then the mass spectrometer would detect
m+1 isotopomers for the TCA intermediates. Interestingly,
after 3 hours of [1-13C]-glutamine labeling, AR and ARV7 significantly increased m+1 isotopomers of citrate
and malate compared to vehicle control (Figure 8F and
8G). Additionally, compared to AR, AR-V7 increased
levels of citrate and fumarate (m+1) (Figure 8F and 8H)
suggesting increased utilization of reductive carboxylation
of glutamine by this AR isoform. Both AR and ARV7 significantly increased glutamate dehydrogenase
(GLUD1), a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes

Although the role of glucose is the primary focus
of many metabolic studies, several groups have shown
the importance of other metabolites in PCa including
fatty acids [37, 38]. AR has been reported to induce fatty
acid synthase (FASN) [13] and to cause lipid droplet

While androgen-mediated AR activity increased lipid
accumulation in LNCaP cells as expected, AR-V7 did not
induce a similar accumulation (Figure 9A). Consistent

with this, a comparison of the expression of genes in the

AR significantly increased mRNA expression of the ratelimiting enzyme, ACACA while AR-V7 did not (Figure

elongase). The difference in lipid droplet accumulation
suggests either AR-V7 does not effectively induce
synthesis of one or more of the components of lipid
droplets, or that the synthesized lipids are used for other
purposes such as phospholipid synthesis. Although this
pathway was not the major focus of our study, ACACA
activity is inhibited by phosphorylation by AMPK [41]
and AR activates AMPK [16]. To test whether AR-V7
also induces this pathway, AMPK and p-AMPK were
measured after activation of AR or AR-V7. Both AR
isoforms increased expression of p-AMPK and AMPK
similar to what has been previously reported [16] (Figure
9D). These findings suggest that AR and AR-V7 should
reduce ACACA activity. However, citrate allosterically
activates ACACA overcoming the inhibitory effects
of phosphorylation [42]. Therefore, the elevated levels
of citrate in hormone treated cells likely counteract the
inhibitory phosphorylation of AMPK on ACACA.
Lipids also can be metabolized through β-oxidation
to provide energy and previous studies have shown that
AR increases β-oxidation [16]. To determine whether
AR-V7 also stimulates β-oxidation of exogenously added
radiolabeled palmitate or oleate, assays were performed as
previously described [16] and radiolabeled CO2 measured.
In LNCaP cells, hormone treatment induced oxidation
of radiolabeled palmitate and oleate (Figure 9E and 9F)
consistent with previous reports [16]. However, AR-V7
did not induce oxidation of either exogenously added fatty
acid. These findings are consistent with the data presented
in Figure 9A indicating that AR-V7 does not alter fatty
acid metabolism in the same manner as full-length AR.
Overall, this study is the first to show the unique
metabolic profiles and functions of AR-V7 summarized
in the model (Figure 10). Both AR and AR-V7 increase
glycolysis through induction of several intermediate
metabolites. Intriguingly, AR-V7 further enhanced
glycolytic flux more effectively than AR at early time
points and showed enhanced conversion of glutamine to
citrate via reductive carboxylation. Furthermore, decreased
steady state levels of citrate despite an enhanced rate of its
synthesis from glucose and glutamine, implies an increase
in the utilization of this key TCA intermediate to generate
biochemical components required for CRPC progression.

In order to investigate these questions, we developed an
inducible LNCaP PCa cell line to regulate expression of
AR-V7. We induced AR-V7 to similar levels as hormonetreated (i.e. activated) AR (Figure 1B) to directly compare
the actions of AR and AR-V7. Although AR-V7 is
expressed at lower levels in many tumors there is also
evidence that it can be expressed at levels similar to AR
levels found in hormone dependent tumors [43, 44]. In this
model, AR-V7 induced classical target genes (PSA and
FKBP5) and increased cell growth and migration similar
to AR (Figure 1C, 1D, and 1E). Thus, with this cell model
we confirmed that AR-V7 mimics some aspects of AR
function as expected based on previous studies.
A number of studies have shown that activated AR
alters cell metabolism by stimulating aerobic glycolysis,
lipid metabolism, and several anabolic processes in PCa
[13-15]. Thus, we sought to compare the actions of the AR
isoforms in altering metabolism and, in particular, focused
on their capacity to utilize glucose and glutamine, two
essential energy sources for cells. The isoforms stimulated
glycolysis to a similar extent when measured by ECAR,
which is a reflection of lactate production (Figure 2).
However, an analysis of the steady state levels of a broad
range of metabolites clearly showed that there were major
isoform specific differences. If AR-V7 were simply a
partial substitute of AR, we would expect that the changes
in metabolites would be in the same direction for AR-V7
and AR although the magnitude could differ. While this is
true for many metabolites (Figure 3B), there are a number
of metabolites that are regulated in the opposite direction
by the two isoforms or exclusively by one isoform.
One of the most striking differences is the change in
citrate levels (Figure 4B). Whereas AR increased citrate,
a metabolite typically found in high concentrations in
androgen-dependent prostate tissue (both normal and
PCa), AR-V7 strongly reduced the level of citrate.
Interestingly, reduced citrate levels are a characteristic
of CRPC, which frequently express AR-V7 (Figure 5B).
Reduced citrate levels could be a reflection of a failure
to synthesize citrate and/or enhanced metabolism of
citrate. To distinguish between the two possibilities, a
3-hour flux analysis was first performed using [U-13C]glucose to measure glycolytic and TCA metabolites.
AR-V7 expression enhanced the levels of citrate derived
from the labeled glucose (Figure 6D), indicating that
there is no reduction in the capacity of this AR isoform to
produce citrate derived from glucose. The second major
potential source to generate citrate is through metabolism
of glutamine. Flux analyses performed using [5-13C]glutamine showed that AR-V7 enhanced the overall
production of labeled citrate derived from glutamine either
through the canonical TCA cycle or through reductive
carboxylation (Figure 8B) or both. The increased use of
reductive carboxylation by AR-V7 to generate the citrate
pool was verified using flux studies employing [1-13C]glutamine (Figure 8F). Thus, AR-V7 accelerates synthesis

DISCUSSION
CRPC is characterized by an aberrant reactivation
of AR through several mechanisms including AR
mutations, AR amplifications, altered signaling pathways,
aberrant local synthesis of androgens, and expression of
constitutively active AR splice variants [1]. Although
AR-V7 is the most thoroughly studied variant, many
aspects of its activities and function are still unknown. A
major debate in the field is whether AR-V7 is simply a
constitutively active partial substitute for full-length AR or
whether it has its own unique gain-of-function activities.

of citrate, but the low steady state levels suggest that it
also enhances subsequent metabolism of citrate.
The alteration in steady state levels of citrate is not
the only AR-V7 specific change. Whereas AR increased
the levels of all TCA metabolites, there was a marked
decrease in malate as well as citrate in AR-V7 expressing
cells despite elevated levels of AKG and OAA. We
identified two factors that are likely to contribute to
the reduced levels of malate despite enhanced levels of
AKG and OAA. First is the differential regulation in the
canonical TCA cycle examined through regulation of key
metabolic genes and with the use of glucose flux analysis.
For example, AR-V7 increased levels of MDH1, which
would be predicted to result in lower levels of malate
and higher levels of OAA. Moreover, AR-V7 decreased
levels of OGDH suggesting higher levels of AKG in AR-

V7 expressing cells relative to vehicle cells (Figure 7A).
Consistent with this is the observation that the glucose flux
studies showed enhanced production of labeled fumarate
and malate in response to R1881, but not to expression of
AR-V7 (Figure 7C and 7D) further indicating full-length
AR’s role in progressing through the canonical TCA cycle.
The second factor contributing to differential levels of
malate by the two receptors is their role in the reductive
carboxylation pathway. The glutamine flux studies showed
that AR-V7 expression increased usage of glutamine
to produce TCA cycle metabolites. Interestingly, the
[1-13C]-glutamine flux indicated that this enhancement
was partially mediated through an increase in reductive
carboxylation of glutamine (Figure 8).
The reduced steady state levels of citrate in ARV7 cells despite synthesis of citrate suggest that it is

Figure 10: AR utilizes the TCA cycle, while AR-V7 preferentially enhances glutaminolysis. This model summarizes our

findings of the metabolic profiles and functions of AR and AR-V7. Beginning with glycolysis, both AR and AR-V7 increased extracellular
acidification rate measuring glycolytic activity. Glycolytic genes and intermediate metabolites were also increased by both AR isoforms.
Metabolic flux analysis revealed that AR-V7 accelerated glycolysis more effectively than AR. Steady state metabolites, gene expression,
and metabolic flux studies showed that AR progresses through the TCA cycle. Dashed arrows next to the metabolic genes indicate AR
isoform specific action. AR can utilize both glucose and glutamine as starting material to progress through the TCA cycle to generate
energy and fuel for cell growth and survival. Furthermore AR can utilize both the canonical the TCA cycle and reductive carboxylation
for glutamine metabolism. Interestingly, AR-V7 has an increased dependence on reductive carboxylation to utilize glutamine as an energy
source as seen with increased gene expression and metabolic flux analysis. Thus, AR-V7 can mimic AR’s metabolic functions regulating
glycolysis and also has unique metabolic roles preferentially enhancing glutaminolysis often seen in many cancer cells (i.e. a component
of the Warburg effect).

rapidly metabolized to other compounds needed for cell
growth. Among the possibilities are lipid and phospholipid
synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and synthesis of steroids.
Since AR is known to induce lipid accumulation [39,40],
we asked whether AR-V7 similarly induced lipid droplet
accumulation. We found that AR-V7 does not induce lipid
accumulation despite inducing FASN mRNA to similar
levels as R1881 treated cells (Figure 9). Neutral lipids
can be used for many purposes including synthesis of
phospholipids, post-translational modification of proteins,
and β-oxidation. Our studies showed, that in contrast to
AR [16], AR-V7 does not accelerate β oxidation measured
using exogenous radiolabeled lipids (Figure 9F and 9G).
Whether AR-V7 stimulates another pathway to utilize
lipids remains to be determined.
ACACA is typically the rate-limiting step in
fatty acid synthesis. There was a small induction of
ACACA mRNA by R1881, but not by AR-V7. ACACA
is inhibited by AMPK mediated phosphorylation [41].
Frigo’s group has shown that full-length AR increases
phosphorylation (activation) of AMPK [16]. The level
of AMPK phosphorylation induced by AR-V7 was
comparable to that induced by AR (Figure 9D) indicating
that preferentially enhanced phosphorylation of AMPK is
not responsible for the lack of lipid accumulation. Since
citrate is an allosteric regulator of ACACA [42], it is
possible that the higher levels of citrate in AR-dependent
cells combined with the increase in ACACA mRNA
contribute to higher levels of ACACA activity in cells with
activated AR relative to AR-V7 expressing cells.
Both AR and AR-V7 increase levels of OAA,
which can be used to make other TCA metabolites or as a
substrate to make amino acids. OAA can be derived from
malate in the canonical TCA cycle or from citrate through
reductive carboxylation. The AR-V7 flux analyses suggest
that AR-V7 is making citrate both from glucose and
through reductive carboxylation of glutamine. Synthesis of
OAA from citrate also produces acetyl-CoA, which can be
used for lipid synthesis or for cholesterol synthesis, which
ultimately leads to the production of steroids. A reduced
level of ACACA may favor cholesterol/steroid synthesis
in cells expressing AR-V7, but this remains to be tested
experimentally.
In summary, we conclude AR-V7 mimics AR in
regulating some of the canonical AR target genes, cell
growth and migration, and in inducing glycolysis. Our
study is the first to identify the novel metabolic functions
of AR-V7. Similar to AR, AR-V7 accelerated glycolysis,
but differences were detected in the subsequent synthesis/
usage of these metabolites. Furthermore, steady state and
metabolic flux analyses demonstrated that AR induced
flux through both the canonical TCA cycle and reductive
carboxylation of glutamine. In contrast, AR-V7 enhanced
reductive carboxylation to generate citrate from glutamine.
Furthermore, the changes in levels of metabolic genes
(OGDH, MDH1, and GLUD1) were consistent with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these findings, but regulation may also occur at additional
levels. This study suggests that AR-V7 does not simply
substitute for AR, but exhibits gains of function that may
include the ability to grow more efficiently in an oxygen
poor environment. Lastly, this study yields potential
pathways to target in combination with current CRPC
therapies to better treat patients whose tumors express ARV7. For example, AR-V7’s reliance on glutamine suggests
the use of a glutaminase inhibitor could be beneficial
although additional pre-clinical studies are needed to
determine whether AR-V7 tumors are strongly dependent
on glutamine. Calithera is currently testing a glutaminase
inhibitor, CB-839, in a phase I clinical trial in solid
tumors that does not include PCa. If AR-V7 tumors are
dependent on glutamine, then CRPC should be considered
in subsequent trials [45, 46].

ECAR (extracellular acidification rate), a measure of
the rate of glycolysis and oxygen consumption rate (OCR),
a measure of the rate of OXPHOS, were determined using a
Seahorse Bioscience XF24 analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience,
North Billerica, MA, USA). LNCaP and LNCaP-AR-V7pHage cells were plated at 30,000 cells/well in Seahorse
XF24 plates coated with BD Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences,
Bedford, MA, USA) and incubated overnight. Cells were
then changed to RPMI 10% stripped media and treated
with vehicle (EtOH), 10 nM R1881, or 20 ng/mL Dox
for 24 hours. Basal measurements and measurements in
the presence of several inhibitors: oligomycin (1.25 μM),
carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone
(FCCP) (1.25 μM), and rotenone (1.25 μM) from XF Cell
Mito Stress Kit (Seahorse Bioscience) were taken and
normalized to cell number.

Metabolomics
LNCaP and LNCaP-AR-V7-pHage cells were
plated at 6 million cells per 10 cm plate and then changed
to RPMI 10% stripped media and treated with vehicle
(EtOH), 10 nM R1881, or 20 ng/mL Dox for 48 hours.
All parental LNCaP cells received Dox treatment to
control for any non-specific effects due to Dox treatment.
After 48 hours, cells were counted and 5 million cells
from each plate were centrifuged to control for cell
number. Four biological replicates collected over several,
independent weeks were prepared for each condition.
Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics profiling using

done as previously described [30, 51].

Growth assay
LNCaP and LNCaP-AR-V7-pHage cells (50,00070,000 cells/well of a 6-well plate) were changed to RPMI
10% charcoal stripped medium and treated with vehicle
(EtOH), 1 nM R1881, or 20 ng/mL of doxycycline (Dox)
for six days. Medium and treatments were replenished
on day 3. Cells were harvested and counted utilizing a
Coulter Counter as previously described [50].

LNCaP and LNCaP-AR-V7-pHage cells were
changed to 10% charcoal stripped medium and treated
with vehicle (EtOH), 1 nM R1881, or 20 ng/mL of Dox
for 24 hours. Then the cells were changed to serum-free
RPMI media overnight. Then 150,000 cells were plated

LNCaP and LNCaP-AR-V7-pHage were plated at 6
million cells per 10 cm plate and then changed to RPMI
10% stripped medium and treated with vehicle (EtOH),
10 nM R1881, or 20 ng/mL Dox for 24 hours. All parental
LNCaP cells also received Dox treatment to control for
any non-specific effects of Dox on the metabolites. Then
medium was changed to starvation medium (serum-free
RPMI lacking either glucose or glutamine) for 6 hours.
Cells were then transferred to either RPMI 10% dialyzed
FBS with either [U-13C]-glucose (11 mM), [1-13C]glutamine (2 mM), or [5-13C]-glutamine (2 mM) for 0 and
3 hours. After the incubation period, medium was removed
and the cells were gently washed with PBS, flash-frozen
with liquid nitrogen, harvested with a mixture of water and
methanol (1:4), and stored at -80°C.
For processing, the frozen samples were thawed
and then mixed with 600 μl of ice-cold chloroform. The

resulting homogenate was then mixed with 260 μl of icecold water and vortexed again for 2 min. The homogenate
was incubated at -20°C for 20 min and centrifuged at 4°C
for 10 min to partition the aqueous and organic layers
and remove the protein at the interface. The aqueous
and organic layers were combined and dried at 37°C
for 45 min in an automatic Environmental Speed Vac®
system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, IL). The extract was
reconstituted in 500 μl of ice-cold methanol: water (1:1)
and filtered through a 3 KDa molecular filter (Amicon
Ultracel -3K Membrane, Millipore Corporation) at 4°C
for 90 min to remove proteins. The filtrate was dried
at 37°C for 45 min in a speed vacuum and stored at
-80°C until mass spectrometry analysis. Prior to mass
spectrometry analysis, the dried extract was re-suspended
in 50 μL of methanol:water (1:1) containing 0.1% formic
acid and then analyzed using SRM (selected reaction
monitoring). Ten microliters were injected and analyzed
using a 6490 QQQ triple quadruple mass spectrometer
(Agilent technologies) coupled to a 1290 series HPLC
system via SRM. Metabolites were targeted in both
positive and negative ion mode, ESI voltage was +4000
V in positive ion mode and -3500 V in negative ion
mode. Approximately 9-12 data points were acquired per
detected metabolite. Samples were delivered to the MS
via normal phase chromatography using a Luna Amino
column (4um, 100A 2.1x150mm, Phenominex) at 400 μl/
min gradient spanning 80 % B to 2 % B over a 20 minute
period followed by 2% B to 80% B for a 5 min period
and followed by 80% B for 8 minute time period reequilibrate the column. Buffer A was comprised of 5 mM
ammonium acetate (pH = 9.9) in water and Buffer B was
100% acetonitrile. To assess the validity of our method
for calculating isotopomers, we determined the complete
isotopomer distributions for each metabolite.
Data analysis was performed in Quantitative
Analysis (Agilent MassHunter (Santa Clara, CA)) and
estimated the % of isotopomer incorporation using the
formula [% of Incorporation = 13C/13C+12C) X100] and
was corrected for isotopomeric distribution and natural
abundance.

temperature. After the stain was removed, the cells were
washed with water and then imaged under a Nikon Phase
Contrast 2 ELWD 0.3 microscope at 20X magnification.

Radiolabeled CO2 trap assays
LNCaP and LNCaP-AR-V7-pHage cells were plated
in 24-well CellBIND (Corning, Manassas, VA, USA)
plates at a density of 60,000 cells per well in RPMI 10%
FBS medium. The next day the cells were changed to
10% charcoal stripped medium and treated with vehicle
(EtOH), 10 nM R1881, or 20 ng/mL of Dox for 24 hours.
After 24 hours, radiolabelled palmitate or oleate was
added for 3 hours. Then 50 μL perchloric acid was added
and allowed to incubate for 1.5 hours. Lastly, 14CO2 was
collected in CO2 traps and counted using a scintillation
counter [16].

Statistical analysis
All data for the experiments were presented as mean
± SEM. The mean displayed was the average of at least
triplicate biological samples in each experiment. Each
experiment was repeated at least three independent times
with the exception of the metabolomics and metabolic
flux assays. Both student’s t-test and one-way ANOVA
followed by a Tukey post-hoc statistical analysis were
used to analyze the results using GraphPad PRISM.
Differences were considered to be statistically significant
at p < 0.05.
