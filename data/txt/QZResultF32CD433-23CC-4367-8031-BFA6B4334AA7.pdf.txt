Abstract
Early imaging or blood biomarkers of tumor response are
desperately needed to customize antiangiogenic therapy for
cancer patients. Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) therapy can ‘‘normalize’’ brain tumor vasculature by
decreasing vessel diameter and permeability, and thinning the
abnormally thick basement membrane. We hypothesized that
the extent of vascular normalization will be predictive of
outcome of anti-VEGF therapy in glioblastoma. We used
advanced magnetic resonance imaging methods to monitor
vascular parameters and treatment response in 31 recurrent
glioblastoma patients enrolled in a phase II trial of cediranib,
an oral pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We
evaluated the correlation between clinical outcome and
magnetic resonance imaging–measured changes in vascular
permeability/flow (i.e., Ktrans) and in microvessel volume, and
the change of circulating collagen IV levels, all after a single
dose of cediranib. Here, we show that evaluation of biomarkers as early as after one day of anti-VEGF therapy with
cediranib is predictive of response in patients with recurrent
glioblastoma. Changes in Ktrans, microvessel volume, and
circulating collagen IV correlated with duration of overall
survival and/or progression-free survival (P < 0.05). When we
combined these three parameters into a ‘‘vascular normalization index,’’ we found that it closely associated with overall
survival (R = 0.54; P = 0.004) and progression-free survival
(R = 0.6; P = 0.001). The vascular normalization index
described here should be validated in randomized clinical
trials. [Cancer Res 2009;69(13):5296–300]

Introduction
Several candidate biomarkers have been proposed for antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody (Genentech). However, there are no
validated predictive biomarkers for any anti-VEGF therapy in
cancer (1). Identification of effective therapies in a timely fashion is
critical for patients with limited survival, such as those with
glioblastoma.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ‘‘water diffusion
mapping’’ has been proposed as an early imaging biomarker for
glioblastoma (2). However, glioblastomas secrete high VEGF levels,
which lead to high vascular permeability and vasogenic edema
(3, 4). Thus, blocking VEGF in glioblastoma likely leads to decreased
vascular permeability, and edema alleviation (5, 6). Unfortunately,
this could lead to difficulties in evaluating tumor response or
diffusion maps using MRI (7). A recent study has identified a
decrease in fluorothymidine uptake measured by positron emission
tomography as a potential predictive marker for recurrent
glioblastoma patients treated with bevacizumab and CPT-11 (8).
Because the decrease in tumor uptake of fluorothymidine might
also be confounded by a reduction in vascular permeability induced
by bevacizumab, it is not clear if this biomarker reflects a decrease
in permeability or proliferation.
Here, we combined imaging with circulating biomarkers. In
preclinical models, anti-VEGF agents rapidly but transiently
‘‘normalize’’ the structure and function of glioblastoma vessels—
they decrease vessel diameter and permeability, increase tumor
oxygenation, and induce a thinning of the abnormally thick
basement membrane (9, 10). Phase II trial data showed that
cediranib (AstraZeneca, a pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor) decreased—as early as after 1 day of treatment—two
neuroimaging biomarkers: vessel diameter (transiently) and
permeability as assessed by Ktrans (more persistently) in a cohort
of 16 consecutive recurrent glioblastoma patients (5). In further
preclinical studies, we found that cediranib can improve survival in
glioblastoma-bearing mice via edema reduction even in the face of
persistent tumor growth (11). In that study, edema alleviation was
due to transient normalization of the vasculature, and was
associated with a transient increase in plasma collagen IV. We
reasoned that increases in circulating collagen IV would reflect
basement membrane thinning.
Because preclinical and clinical findings suggest that vascular
normalization by cediranib therapy might be beneficial in
glioblastoma patients, we hypothesized that changes at day 1 in
three biomarkers related to vascular normalization would be
predictive of improved survival in recurrent glioblastoma patients.
Moreover, we hypothesized that a composite index based on the
early changes in biomarkers of vascular normalization would more
closely predict the outcome of cediranib treatment.

Biomarkers for Anti-VEGF Therapy in Glioblastoma
before the first treatment, as well as 1 d after the first treatment on a 3 Tesla
MRI system (Siemens), for the following key sequences:.
Dynamic contrast-enhanced images. This is a series of acquisitions
of a 50.6-mm-thick slab consisting of 20 slices. All scans are 2.9  2.0 mm
in-plane resolution, with a 2.1 mm slice thickness, 0.4 mm interslice gap,
using a fast gradient echo technique (TR, 5.7 ms; TE, 2.73 ms). Data to
allow computation of a T1 map of the tissue of interest are initially
created using five different flip angles (2j, 5j, 10j, 15j, 30j). Then, the
same slab of tissue is sampled with a 10j flip angle every 5.04 s for 252 s
(50 time points), and 0.1 mMol/kg of gadopentetate-dimeglumine was
injected 52 s after the beginning of the acquisition at 5 cc/s. Imaging time
was 4 min and 12 s.
Permeability maps. Dynamic contrast-enhanced–MRI data were
processed using custom made software written in Matlab to obtain
maps of Ktrans (corresponding roughly to wash-in rates of the contrast
agent; ref. 12). Ktrans can be influenced by flow, or by permeability, or
both. In high-flow organs such as the brain, flow limitations are not
usually a concern, but the blood-brain barrier severely limits permeability
unless it is disrupted by disease. Even in such a state, Ktrans does not fully
correspond to permeability, but it is related rather to the permeabilitysurface area product of the capillary bed (in nonflow-limited situations).
Based on our previous data (5), Ktrans most likely is strongly related to
permeability in this setting, although some flow dependence may be
present as well.

Dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging. A 75-mm slab of tissue was
imaged using a dual-echo, combined gradient-echo, and spin-echo planar
sequence (TE, 34/103); each image had 1.7 mm in-plane resolution and
5 mm through plane resolution (128  128 matrix). There was a 2.5 mm
interslice gap and 10 slices. We acquired 120 blocks of images—a block
every 1.33 s. Gadopentetate-dimeglumine (0.2 mMol/kg) was injected at
5 cc/s after 85 s of imaging. Imaging time was 2 min and 45 s.
Blood volume maps. Relative CBV of smaller vessels (spin-echo images)
was calculated using a standard deconvolution technique (13), with CBV
corrected for leakage of the contrast agent across the blood-brain barrier
(14, 15). These maps are relative and therefore unitless.
Patients continued cediranib monotherapy until progression, and
we monitored the duration of PFS using T1-enhancement volume
(Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2; Fig. 1).

Measurement of Circulating Collagen IV
Peripheral blood was obtained with informed consent from all patients
at baseline and 1 d following the first dose of cediranib. Blood was
collected in an EDTA-containing vacutainer, spun down, and plasma was
aliquoted, and frozen immediately. We measured the plasma levels of
soluble collagen IV using ELISA kits from Exocell, Inc. We measured the
plasma levels of Ang1/Ang2 using ELISA kits (R&D Systems) and matrix
metalloproteinase 2 using MSD plates (MesoScale-Discovery). Samples
were run in duplicate.

Statistical Analysis
We used multivariable Cox regression analyses of changes in three
parameters: Ktrans, microvessel CBV, and plasma collagen IV 1 d after the
first dose of cediranib. The vascular normalization index (VNI) was
obtained as the negative of the linear predictor in the Cox regression with
all three variables included, using regression’s coefficient estimates. For
example, if coefficients in the Cox regression predicting hazard of death
were a for Ktrans change (DKtrans), b for CBV change (DCBV), and c for
plasma collagen IV changes (Dcoll IV), then the index was
VNI ¼ ½ða  Ktrans Þ þ ðb  CBVÞ þ ðc  coll IVÞ:
We expressed the changes as the logarithm of the day 1 to pretreatment
level ratios. We present hazard ratio estimates and P values from the Wald
test. In addition, we used a recursive partitioning analysis classes—a
prognostic factor of outcome used for stratification of glioblastoma patients
in clinical studies in which age, extent of resection, performance, and mental
status are combined into one discrete variable (16, 17). Furthermore, we
adjusted for log-transformed pretreatment tumor volume. The importance
of sequential addition to the regression model of Ktrans, collagen IV, and CBV
was tested in the analysis of deviance table, using residual deviance statistic
and related P values from the likelihood ratio test. (m2 tests were performed
to compare the observed improvement versus adding a random noise.)
Associations between biomarker changes and progression-free survival
(PFS; at 6 mo) and overall survival (OS; at 1 y) were analyzed using logistic
regression with cubic-spline function of a covariate.

Results and Discussion
Cediranib efficacy in recurrent glioblastoma. Thirty of 31
patients enrolled had at least a transient radiographic response to
cediranib (Fig. 1). One patient dropped out of the study before
receiving cediranib. The median PFS (with 95% confidence
intervals) of the 30 recurrent glioblastoma patients who received
cediranib was 117 days (88–145; Supplementary Fig. S1). The
median OS was 227 days (177–293; Supplementary Fig. S2). The
rate of patients alive and progression-free at 6 months was 25.8%
(14.7–47.9).
Association between biomarkers and outcome. Several of the
parameters measured by us—functionally related to vascular

normalization (5, 10, 11)—changed after 1 day of cediranib
treatment (Supplementary Table S1). However, only the early
changes in Ktrans, microvessel CBV, and plasma collagen IV
correlated with survival outcomes (Supplementary Table S2;
Fig. 2). Of the 30 patients treated, all three parameters were
reliably measured in 28 patients.
A greater reduction in Ktrans after one dose of cediranib was seen
in patients with increased PFS (P = 0.0015) and OS (P = 0.0039;
Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). Of note, in two previous phase I
studies of the pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor
vatalanib (Novartis) in patients with colorectal cancer and
metastatic liver lesions, favorable outcomes correlated with
significantly greater reductions in Ki (a parameter related to Ktrans)
at day 2 (18). Similarly, in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
patients, a greater reduction in Ktrans at 14 days after sunitinib
(a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor; Pfizer) was significantly
associated with increased PFS in a phase II study (19).
In addition, a greater increase in the CBV of tumor microvessels
after one dose of cediranib was seen in the glioblastoma patients
with extended OS (P = 0.0056; Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Finally, a greater increase in collagen IV levels in plasma was
detected in patients with extended PFS (P = 0.0010; Supplementary
Fig. S3D).
Association between a VNI and outcome. To test if we could
more precisely predict outcomes after cediranib, we then combined
these three parameters into a composite index. The index for
prediction of OS was calculated as
½0:82x1  1:95x2  4:95x3 
and the index for prediction of PFS as
½0:92x1  7:17x2  2:63x3 
where x1, x2, and x3 denote log-transformed ratios of day 1 to
baseline levels of, Ktrans, collagen IV, and CBV, respectively.
We found that this VNI closely correlated with PFS (Spearman’s
U = 0.60; P = 0.001) and OS (U = 0.54; P = 0.004; Figs. 2C–D and 3).

Biomarkers for Anti-VEGF Therapy in Glioblastoma

Figure 3. Multivariate analyses for
correlation between parameters related
to vascular normalization and survival
outcomes. A, the ratio of Ktrans and of
collagen IV measured at day 1 and
baseline and VNI values are significantly
correlated with PFS at 3, 4.5, and 6 mo.
B, the ratio of Ktrans and of microvessel
CBV measured at day 1 and baseline and
VNI values are significantly correlated with
OS at 6, 9, and 12 mo. Strikingly, all 17
patients with Ktrans values at day 1 higher
than 25% of baseline value died within 1 y,
whereas 5 (42%) of the 12 patients with a
Ktrans drop below 25% of baseline value
survived >1 y.

into Cox regression showed that collagen IV is significant, in
addition to Ktrans, for prediction of PFS (P = 0.002, likelihood ratio
test); similarly, microvessel CBV is significant, in addition to Ktrans,
for prediction of OS (P = 0.008; Supplementary Tables S3–5). Thus,
collagen IV and microvessel CBV are important components of
these regression models: the residual deviance reduction resulting
from addition of both collagen IV and microvessel CBV is higher
than the deviance reduction for Ktrans alone.
Next, we stratified patients by score quartiles and found that
Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS and OS were gradually increasing
according to the quartile group (Fig. 4). The VNI differentiated
patients with favorable versus unfavorable outcome after a single
dose of cediranib, indicating that evaluating the degree of
tumor ‘‘vascular normalization’’ immediately after anti-VEGF
treatment may be potentially used to predict better outcome in
glioblastoma.
The prognostic recursive partitioning analysis class was 3 for 12
patients (40%), 4 for 12 patients (40%), and 5 for 6 (20%) of patients.
Recursive partitioning analysis value showed only a trend for
correlation with OS (P = 0.096), potentially due to the small sample
size. In multivariate analysis, the associations between PFS and
change at day 1 in Ktrans and circulating collagen IV, and VNI, and

www.aacrjournals.org

between OS and change at day 1 in Ktrans and CBV, and VNI were
highly significant (Supplementary Fig. S4, Tables S3, S6, and S7;
Fig. 3).
Implications. Although PFS evaluated by volumetric measurements of tumor enhancement correlated with OS in this study
(Spearman’s U = 0.69), it cannot be used as a ‘‘predictive biomarker.’’
The ability to identify tumor-specific changes rapidly after
treatment may allow tailoring of therapy to those patients most
likely to benefit, and early discontinuation of an ineffective therapy
in others. In addition, these biomarkers could also be valuable for
treatment of benign tumors (e.g., schwannomas) or nonneoplastic
diseases (e.g., macular degeneration) characterized by abnormal
vessels (20). The biomarker candidates from this hypothesisgenerating study need to be validated in large trials as predictive
biomarkers and methodology needs to be established for its clinical
use in individual glioblastoma patients.
