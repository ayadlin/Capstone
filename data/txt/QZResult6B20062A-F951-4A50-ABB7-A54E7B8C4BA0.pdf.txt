Prolactin and Breast Cancer: The Need to Avoid
Undertreatment of Serious Psychiatric Illnesses in Breast
Cancer Patients: A Review
Denise Froes Brandao, MD1,2,3; Kathrin Strasser-Weippl, MD, MBA4; and Paul E. Goss, MD, PhD1,2,5,6

Hyperprolactinemia, defined as a sustained elevation of prolactin (PRL) levels greater than 530 mIU/L in women and greater than
424 mIU/L in men, has been implicated for a long time in breast cancer etiology and prognosis. Elevated PRL values (approximately
2-3 times higher than the reference values) are a common adverse effect of antipsychotic medications, especially with firstgeneration drugs, and most antipsychotics carry a standard warning regarding PRL elevations on their US product labels. These associations foster undertreatment of serious psychiatric illnesses in both otherwise healthy patients and cancer patients. This review
assesses both the preclinical and clinical evidence that has led to the hypothesis of PRL’s role in breast cancer risk or breast cancer
progression. It is concluded that taken together, the published data are unconvincing and insufficient to deprive cancer patients in
general and breast cancer patients specifically of potentially effective antipsychotic or antidepressant medications for serious psychiatric indications. We thus call on revised medication guidelines to avoid the existing undertreatment of serious psychiatric illnesses among

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and is the most frequent cancer among women.1 Aside from a
few relatively infrequent specific causes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, a prior history of radiation therapy in adolescence, and a personal history of pre-invasive lesions, the cause or causes of breast cancer are largely unknown. Since the
1990s, one hypothesis has focused on a causal role for prolactin (PRL) in breast tumorigenesis and prognosis. This review
summarizes the preclinical and clinical evidence for a role of PRL in breast cancer etiology and prognosis. Our report also
focuses on the possible influence of psychiatric drugs on PRL levels and on their putative indirect influence on the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Finally, our review endeavors to weigh the existing evidence for and against the use of antipsychotic drugs in breast cancer patients.
PRL AND THE HUMAN BREAST
PRL is a neuroendocrine polypeptide hormone produced primarily by the lactotroph cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland (the adenohypophysis) but also by other tissues, such as the mammary gland, lymphocytes, uterus, prostate,
and placental decidua. All functions of PRL are mediated via prolactin receptors (PRLRs). Physiologically, PRL stimulates
DNA synthesis, epithelial cell proliferation, and milk production in the breast.2 Although the physiological function of
PRL in the mammary gland is evident, its role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer is unclear.
EFFECTS OF ANTIPSYCHOTICS ON PRL LEVELS
PRL homeostasis is the result of a balance between positive and negative stimuli derived from both external and endogenous factors. Hyperprolactinemia is defined as a sustained elevation of PRL levels above the normal laboratory level
(530 mIU/L [25 ng/mL] in women and 424 mIU/L [20 ng/mL] in men).3 Elevated PRL values (approximately 2-3

times higher than the reference values) are a common
adverse effect of antipsychotic medications, especially with
first-generation drugs.4,5 The hypothalamus regulates the
synthesis and secretion of PRL by the pituitary gland
through inhibitory factors such as dopamine. Antipsychotics elevate PRL levels by promoting a blockade of
dopamine D2 receptors, which, in turn, increase PRL production.5 Second-generation antipsychotics cause smaller
elevations of PRL levels than first-generation agents, except
for risperidone, which is associated with a more pronounced increase in PRL levels than other secondgeneration agents. With the exception of aripiprazole and
clozapine, all antipsychotics carry a standard warning
regarding PRL elevations on their US product labels.4,6
Antidepressant therapies can also cause drug-induced
hyperprolactinemia, although less frequently than antipsychotics. Antidepressants with serotonergic activity can
increase PRL levels through the enhancement of serotonin
activity by inhibiting neuronal serotonin reuptake. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and some tricyclic antidepressants
can also cause hyperprolactinemia by reducing catecholamines in the hypothalamus,7 whereby an elevation of PRL
levels has been shown to be associated with a better
response to the antidepressants.8,9 The mechanism of the
potential link between antidepressant treatment and hyperprolactinemia is still not completely elucidated.
PRECLINICAL EVIDENCE LINKING PRL
TO BREAST CANCER
Evidence relating PRL and breast cancer emerged in the
1990s when a study showed that activation of PRLR
induced mammary carcinomas in transgenic mice.10
Another study demonstrated that the expression levels of
PRLR were higher in human breast cancer cells than normal breast tissue.11 Through these receptors, cells in breast
carcinomas are highly sensitive to stimulation by PRL.12 It
was suggested that PRL might have not only a paracrine
effect but also an autocrine effect on breast cancers and
stimulate the growth of malignant neighboring cells in the
breast when there is a carcinoma.13 In vitro studies of PRLinduced proliferation of breast cancer cells suggested that
the increase in the growth of mammary carcinomas in
rodents is possibly mediated through an intermediary autocrine or paracrine factor within the mammary gland.14
PRL AND BREAST CANCER RISK
AND PROGNOSIS IN HUMANS
In humans, the proliferative effect of PRL on existing
breast cancers (negative prognostic effect in breast cancer
patients) and the influence of elevated plasma PRL levels

on breast cancer promotion (elevation of the breast cancer
risk in healthy individuals) have been studied:
In breast cancer patients, data from a recent study
were unable to confirm the idea that locally produced PRL
is relevant for breast cancer tumorigenesis and progression.
Specifically, PRL messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in
breast cancer samples was found to be very low/undetectable
in most samples from breast cancer patients by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction analysis. PRL protein secretion
by these cells was also below the detection limit of an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and there was no correlation between PRL mRNA expression and immunohistochemical localization of the PRL protein; this indicated
that the presence of PRL mRNA does not necessarily point
to the presence of the PRL protein. The authors of this study
concluded that an autocrine effect by PRL is unlikely to be a
mechanism promoting breast cancer in humans.15 In addition, efforts to develop a PRLR blocking agent (based on
the aforementioned rationale that the PRL/PRLR pathway
might play a tumor-promoting role in breast cancer) have
failed so far, and all such drug candidates to date have
proved to be ineffective. Following these observations,
many have thus now concluded that the true role of PRL in
breast cancer prognosis remains obscure, and this undermines the potential usefulness of PRLR antagonists as a
potential strategy for breast cancer treatment.16
Data related to breast cancer risk elevation in patients
with hyperprolactinemia are sparse. Three small prospective studies did not find a significant relation between PRL
levels and breast cancer risk in either premenopausal or
postmenopausal women.17-19 Another study involving a
cohort of 969 patients with hyperprolactinemia also did
not show an increased risk of breast cancer.20
One of 2 larger studies examining the relation
between PRL and the risk of breast cancer was a nested
case-control study within the Nurse’s Health Study and
Nurse’s Health Study II. PRL levels were measured <10
and 10 years before a breast cancer diagnosis. After 20
years of follow-up, the study demonstrated a modest positive association between serum PRL concentrations and
breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women only
when they were measured within 10 years of diagnosis,
especially in women developing estrogen receptor–positive disease. There was no significant association among
premenopausal women or among those with estrogen receptor–negative breast cancer.21
In another large case-control study, the European
Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition
(EPIC) study, the association of prediagnostic circulating
levels of PRL with the risk of breast cancer was analyzed in
185

a female subcohort.22 Findings were adjusted by menopausal status, the use of postmenopausal hormone replacement
therapy (determined from a blood donation specimen),
and the estrogen and progesterone receptor status of onstudy breast cancer primary tumors. With a total of 2250
incident breast cancer cases, the study showed that among
postmenopausal women, there was a significant positive
association of PRL levels with overall breast cancer risk.
However, this increased risk was limited to women who
were using hormone replacement therapy at the time of the
blood donation. Importantly, data from several other studies suggest that combined hormone therapy is not causal
for elevated blood PRL levels in these patients taking hormone replacement therapy.23-25 Among premenopausal
women in the EPIC cohort, there was a statistically nonsignificant inverse association of PRL levels with breast cancer risk. In contrast to the data found in the Nurse’s
Cohort,21 there was no evidence for heterogeneity of the
PRL–breast cancer association by receptor status. A limitation of this study was that each woman had PRL measurements of only a single blood sample, and this may limit the
interpretation of women’s average PRL levels over time
periods longer than 5 to 10 years.
Higher circulating PRL levels were also related to in
situ breast cancer risk in a case-control study nested within
the EPIC cohort.26 An association was more pronounced
among postmenopausal women using hormone therapy
versus nonusers and among nulliparous women versus
parous women. However, case numbers in these subgroups were small, and the test, testing for heterogeneity
between hormone therapy users and nonusers, was not
statistically significant.
In all of these studies, PRL levels were measured
with an immunoassay, a method that captures multiple
isoforms and may not reflect the biologic activity of the
specific PRL that is important to breast carcinogenesis. In
another nested case-control study within the Nurse’s
Health Study and Nurse’s Health Study II, PRL levels
were determined with a bioassay, which is a very sensitive
measure of the somatolactogenic activity of PRL. A clear
relation between PRL levels with this assay and breast cancer risk was not observed. Interestingly, though, levels of
bioactive PRL were associated with several known breast
cancer risk factors, including parity, a family history of
breast cancer, age at menopause, and body mass index.27
USE OF ANTIPSYCHOTICS OR
ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND BREAST CANCER
Several studies have been unable to confirm a positive
association between the use of antipsychotics and breast
186

cancer risk clinically. In a retrospective cohort study28
comparing 52,819 women exposed and 55,289 not
exposed to antipsychotic dopamine antagonists, participants were followed for 6 years, and a dose-dependent
association with a 16% increase in the risk of breast cancer
was shown. However, the authors concluded that because
of methodological limitations, these findings should not
change treatment strategies. The increase in risk, though
statistically significant, was small in absolute terms. Concerningly, the authors found that women who were
treated with antipsychotic medications were less likely to
receive breast cancer screening through mammography
and outpatient medical visits. A systematic review by
Fond et al,29 also concluded that use of antipsychotics cannot currently be considered to be a risk factor for breast
cancer, even though some antipsychotics have shown carcinogenic properties in experimental studies with rodents. A
recent review30 addressed the role of antipsychotic agents
and PRL levels in studies of breast cancer risk and focused
on women with schizophrenia. The authors found that
numerous risk factors such as nulliparity, obesity, diabetes
mellitus, alcohol intake, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle
were important for increasing breast cancer risk, whereas
PRL levels in these patients were not.
Studies evaluating a possible association between the
use of antidepressants and breast cancer likewise did not
link these medications to breast cancer risk.31-33 A large
case-control study analyzed the use of selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which have the potential to
increase circulating PRL levels.34 The authors compared
2129 women with primary invasive breast cancer with
21,297 women randomly selected from the population.
Exclusive users of SSRIs were not at increased risk for
breast cancer in comparison with nonusers. Another casecontrol study evaluated the effects of the use of SSRIs and
the duration of treatment, cumulative dose, and latency
on breast cancer risk.35 The study compared 1701 women
with primary invasive breast cancer with 17,017 women
from the population. The results did not indicate that the
risk of breast cancer is increased with short- or long-term
use of SSRIs.

mortality.36-39 Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of
cancer-related depression are common,40 not least because
package inserts for antipsychotics and antidepressants frequently recommend against prescribing these medications
to patients who have breast cancer.2 Consequently, psychiatrists may avoid using low-dose antipsychotics, which
are effective as mood stabilizers to augment the benefit of
antidepressants, or antidepressants in breast cancer patients
because of the risk of hyperprolactinemia, although there is
no clear causal relation between antipsychotics or antidepressants and breast cancer risk.
Taken together, the data published to date are
unconvincing and insufficient to deprive cancer patients
in general and breast cancer patients specifically of potentially effective antipsychotic and antidepressant medications for serious psychiatric indications, including
depression. In the interim, further research is needed to
clarify the relation between hyperprolactinemia caused by
these medications and the risk of breast cancer. Revised
medication guidelines are needed to avoid possible side
effects and the existing undertreatment of serious psychiatric ramifications among cancer patients.
