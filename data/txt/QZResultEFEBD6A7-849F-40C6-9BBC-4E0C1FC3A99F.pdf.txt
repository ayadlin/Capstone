BACKGROUND. There are few patient-reported data regarding quality of life after
taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy and none regarding mental health outcomes.

METHODS. This was a naturalistic, longitudinal study that used a case–control
design. Data were derived from a randomized clinical trial in patients who had
stage II/III breast cancer (N 5 227). Paclitaxel (Taxol) was approved for use midway during the accrual period (1994–1999). Patients who received taxanes as part
of their adjuvant chemotherapy (the taxane group; n 5 55) were matched with
patients receiving regimens without taxanes (the no-taxane group; n 5 83) on

patients’ symptoms and Karnofsky performance status and in patient-reported
quality of life (the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form) and emotional
distress (Profile of Mood States; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression
scale).

RESULTS. As expected, patients in the taxane group experienced significantly
higher rates of selected toxicities, including arthralgia/myalgia (45% vs 26%) and
ataxia (20% vs 5%). Patients in the taxane group also had significantly worse emotional distress and mental quality of life throughout adjuvant treatment. Rates of
probable clinical depression also were high. In contrast, these outcomes were
improving for patients in the no-taxane group (all P < .023). Emotional recovery

months for patients in the no-taxane group. During Years 3 through 5, the groups
had similar outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS. These data suggested that taxane-based chemotherapies confer
risk for significant psychological symptoms. Depression, in particular, should be
monitored. Cancer 2008;113:638–47.  2008 American Cancer Society.

cancer) or from patients with metastatic disease may
not generalize to the adjuvant breast cancer setting
because of differing symptom profiles, dosing, or
agents used in combination with taxanes.
Paclitaxel (PTX) (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb,
NY), which was approved for adjuvant use in breast
cancer in October 1999,3 and docetaxel (T) (Taxotere;
Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France), which was approved in
August 2004,3 were shown in Phase 2 clinical trials to
cause significant neurotoxicity, arthralgia, myalgia,
skin reactions, neurosensory disturbance, and peripheral neuropathy, in addition to side effects that
are common to many chemotherapy drugs (eg, neutropenia, alopecia4–7). Although clinically manageable, the toxicity profile of taxanes in phase 3 trials
continues to be noteworthy for neurologic toxicities.8–12
Three phase 3 clinical trials have suggested that
quality of life declines during the period of taxane
delivery, as can occur with other agents, but it also
declines differentially. Fountzilas and colleagues10
reported that patients who received PTX with a regimen that included epirubicin (E), cyclophosphamide
(C), methotrexate (M), and 5-fluoracil (F) (E-CMF)
reported poorer social functioning, emotional functioning, and pain during chemotherapy relative to
patients who received E-CMF without PTX. Similar
results were reported in 2 trials by Martin and colleagues,11,12 who compared patients who received T,
doxorubicin (A), and C (TAC) with patients who
received FAC. Only Martin and colleagues11,12 have
reported quality-of-life data regarding outcomes after
chemotherapy. They reported that global quality of
life was similar for the TAC and the FAC group at a
6-month follow-up. Additional data are needed to
determine whether this positive evaluation is reliable.
The objective of the current study was, with
a case-control design, to determine short-term
(during treatment), moderate-term (2 year), and
long-term (up to 5 years) toxicity and quality of life
for patients who received taxanes compared with
patients who did not. A phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a psychological intervention
that accrued patients with breast cancer (N 5 227)
prior the start of adjuvant therapy and followed
them for 5 years provided data. Midway through the
accrual period (1994–2000), taxane-containing trials
and clinical use began. Thus, a naturalistic observational study resulted, with 2 patient groups that differed primarily in their exposure to taxane-based
chemotherapy. We tested the hypothesis that taxane
treatment is associated with poorer outcomes—
signs, symptoms, toxicities, psychological outcomes,

639

and quality of life—during treatment delivery and
recovery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Trial Sample
Patients (N 5 227) with newly diagnosed, surgically
treated stage II or III breast cancer (TNM staging
system13; International Classification of Diseases, 9th
Revision codes 174.0–174.9) were eligible and were
accrued between 1994 and 2000 through a university-affiliated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Details
of the informed-consent procedures and accrual
have been published.14,15 All participants were provided, in person, oral and written informed consent
in keeping with institutional guidelines and in accordance with an assurance approved by and filed
with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. After surgery and before randomization and
adjuvant therapy, patients completed face-to-face
interviews and questionnaires, and a nurse completed a health status evaluation. Patients were stratified and randomized to an assessment-only arm or
to a psychological intervention with assessment arm.
Follow-up assessments occurred every 4 months during Year 1 and every 6 months during Years 2
through 5. Patients remained in the trial only as long
as they remained recurrence-free. Patients in the
intervention arm experienced reduced emotional distress at 4 months and 12 months, as reported previously.14,15
Research Design and Patients
A case–control, repeated-measures design was used.
With data from a subset of patients from the RCT
(N 5 227), 2 patient groups were defined: the taxane
group and the no-taxane group. Patients who had
received taxanes were matched to patients who had
not. Matching variables were RCT study arm (the
psychological intervention and assessment arm vs
the assessment-only arm), lymph node status, tumor
size, surgery type, menopausal status, and partner
status. For each patient in the taxane group, 1 or 2
matches were identified. At each chemotherapy
cycle, patients in both groups received from 8 mg to
20 mg dexamethasone as an antiemetic.
Taxane group
Of 227 patients, 55 received taxanes as part of the
following regimens: AC-PTX (n 5 45), A-T (n 5 5), or
AC-T (n 5 5). Of those 55 patients, 37 (67%) were
participating in chemotherapy clinical trials (Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] 94–10; National Surgi-

and B-30; and Cancer and Leukemia Group B
[CALGB] 49,802, 49,906, and C9741), and a subset of
those 37 patients (n 5 22) had been randomized to a
taxane study arm. The remaining 18 of 55 patients
(33%) received taxanes as part of standardized, offprotocol regimens (eg, 4 cycles of 600 mg/m2 C with
60 mg/m2 A followed by 4 cycles of 175 mg/m2 PTX).
Of the 55 patients who received taxanes, 1 patient
reacted adversely to her first cycle of T and thereafter
received A-PTX (n 5 1). Across all drugs, the median
relative dose intensity16 was 91.9%; for taxanes, the
median relative dose intensity was 93.4%.

No-taxane group
Matched patients for the no-taxane group (n 5 83)
were identified as described above. Among those
patients, approximately half (n 5 41) were in chemotherapy clinical trials, including trials in which
patients were randomized to a no-taxane arm
(n 5 24 patients; 29%; SWOG 94-10, NSABP B-28,
and CALGB 49,802) and other clinical trials that did
not include taxanes (n 5 17 patients; 20%; NSABP B23, SWOG 88-14, SWOG 9061, and SWOG 93-13). The
remaining patients (n 5 42) received standardized,
off-protocol regimens (n 5 42 patients; 51%; eg, 6
cycles of 500 mg/m2 C, 50 mg/m2 A, and 500 mg/m2
F). The regimens were as follows: AC (n 5 62), CMF
(n 5 14), FAC (n 5 5), MF (n 5 1), and CAMF
(n 5 1). The median relative dose intensity across all
drugs was 91.3%.

Measures
Nurse-rated health
Signs, symptoms, and toxicities. A research nurse
documented chemotherapy delays due to toxicities
and completed a rating scale (1994 version) used by
the SWOG14,17 documenting the type and severity of
toxicities from chemotherapy. The current analyses
focused on 9 items that were chosen a priori based
on the most common effects of taxane treatments
reported in phase 3 trials.8–12 We examined 3 items
relevant to peripheral neuropathy (parasthesia/
numbness, motor weakness, and incontinence), 3
items relevant to neurosensory dysfunction (incoordination/ataxia, loss of reflexes, and change in hearing, vision, or taste), and 1 item each for
neurotoxicity (ie, disorientation, somnolence, or agitation), arthralgia/myalgia, and dermatologic toxicity.
All items were coded as 0 (sign/symptom absent), 1
(mild/moderate; grade 1 or 2 toxicity), or 2 severe/
life-threatening; grade 3 or 4 toxicity) as specified by
the SWOG rating scale.

Performance status. The Karnofsky performance status (KPS) measure ranges from 0 to 100 with higher
scores indicating better functional status.18

Patient-reported outcomes
Emotional distress. The 65-item Profile of Mood
States (POMS) assessed emotional distress, including
anxiety, depression, and fatigue.19 Scores range from
232 to 200, and higher scores indicate greater distress. In the current study, the Cronbach a reliability
of the POMS was 0.92.
Depressive symptoms. The Iowa short form of the
Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale
(CES-D) was used.20,21 Scores range from 0 to 22,
and scores 10 indicate clinically significant depressive symptoms. In the current study, the Cronbach a
reliability was 0.77.
Health-related quality of life. The 36-item Medical
Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36) yields a Physical
Component score (PCS) and a Mental Component
score (MCS) that summarize quality of life.22 The
component scores are standardized to have a mean
score of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher
scores reflect better quality of life. The Cronbach a
reliability for the PCS and the MCS was 0.94 and
0.89, respectively.
Analytic Strategy
The incidence and severity of side effects and toxicities also were noted. For these data, chi-square analyses tested for group differences. Prechemotherapy
symptoms, signs, and toxicities were examined first,
and only signs/symptoms that appeared or worsened
with chemotherapy were analyzed. There were 11 follow-up assessments. To enhance reliability and
examine critical phases of follow-up, assessments
were collapsed for analysis into early symptoms
(Year 1: during and soon after adjuvant chemotherapy; 4-, 8-, and 12-month assessments; and Year 2:
18- and 24-month assessments) and late symptoms
(Year 3: 30- and 36-month assessments; Year 4: 42and 48-month assessments; and Year 5: (54- and 60month assessments).
Multilevel mixed-effects models were used to
test for group differences in emotional distress and
quality-of-life trajectories over the 5-year follow-up.
Preliminary analyses revealed that the raw self-report
data (emotional distress, depressive symptoms, and
quality of life) showed a rapid improvements from
the initial assessment to 12 months with further
improvement although less rapid, from 12 to 24
months, and little change thereafter. Because a polynomial function (eg, linear or quadratic) cannot adequately represent such a complex pattern of change,

Emotional Recovery After Taxanes/Thornton et al.

2 models were estimated for each outcome. An ‘early’
model described the period of change (prechemotherapy baseline assessment and 4-, 8-, 12-, 18-,
and 24-month assessments), and a ‘late’ model
described stable, long-term outcomes (30-, 36-, 42-,
48-, 54-, and 60-month assessments).
Six fixed effects were tested: intercept, linear
slope, quadratic change, group differences in intercept,
group differences in slope, and group differences in
quadratic change. Factors that did not improve the
fit of the model (based on the Bayseian Information
Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion) were
removed for parsimony. Time was coded as months.
With these analyses, we tested the hypotheses that
the groups would show differential changes during
chemotherapy and the year thereafter in the early
models and would show different long-term outcomes in the late models.

RESULTS
Preliminary Analyses
Table 1 provides descriptive data. The taxane and
no-taxane groups were equivalent on baseline demographic, prognostic, and treatment variables with 1
exception. As expected, the number of weeks
between the first and last chemotherapy administration was significantly higher in the taxane group
(P < .001). Therefore, the number of weeks of chemotherapy was included as a control in the multilevel
models.
The baseline assessment was conducted before
the receipt of adjuvant therapy, as noted above. All
patients began treatment after the initial assessment.
By the 4-month assessment, some patients (n 5 38;
18%) had completed adjuvant therapy. By 8 months,
the majority of patients had completed treatment
(n 5 129; 93%), and by 12 months, all patients
(100%) had completed treatment.
At 60 months, follow-up data were available for
87 of 138 patients (63%). Of the 51 patients without
60-month data, 30 patients had developed recurrent
disease or had died, and 21 patients had withdrawn
from the study. The groups did not differ in the rates
of recurrence, death, study withdrawal, or participation at 60 months (all P  .205). Regarding the number of data points, there were 1216 completed
assessments; 216 assessments were missing because
of patient recurrence or death, 140 assessments were
missing because of patient withdrawal from the
study, and 94 assessments were missed by patients
who continued participating in the study. All available data were used.

Signs, Symptoms, and Toxicities: Incidence
and Group Differences
Patients who received taxanes experienced more
symptoms during chemotherapy, as expected. Moreover, they were more likely to have cycles prolonged
in days because of toxicities (50% vs 32% in the notaxane group; chi-square [df 5 1] 5 4.12; P 5 .042).
Across all patients, the most common reasons for
chemotherapy delay were leukopenia (n 5 28), infections (n 5 15), pain (n 5 11), fever (n 5 8), and nausea (n 5 8). Group comparisons of the reasons for
chemotherapy delays indicated that patients in the
taxane group were more likely to require delays
because of pain (18% vs 3%; Fisher exact P 5 .003).
Other reasons for delay were distributed equally
across groups (P > .06).
In addition, patients in the taxane group experienced a greater number and severity of 6 of the 9
signs/symptoms during the months of chemotherapy
(4-, 8-, and 12-month assessments) (Fig. 1a). No life-

(chi-square [df 5 2] 5 0.48; P 5 .788). Unfortunately,
the final item, parasthesia/numbness, referred to
sensation at the surgical site rather than the periphery, which precluded our examination of the symptom in hands and feet. Greater than 90% of patients
reported this symptom before receiving any chemotherapy. Therefore, it is not included in Figure 1.
Data from Years 2 through 5 indicated no differences between groups on any of the 9 symptoms (all

Psychological and Quality-of-life Trajectories
Emotional distress (POMS) and depressive symptoms
(CES-D)
Results of the multilevel models are provided in Table 2. The predicted trajectories produced by the
analyses closely approximated the raw data, as illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2a illustrates the observed
mean scores by group for the POMS across time. Figure 2b illustrates the predicted trajectories by group
for the POMS across 2 time periods. The groups did
not differ significantly at baseline, as indicated by
the intercept parameters. The early model (from the
initial assessment to 24 months) suggested that the
no-taxane group enjoyed early, rapid relief from distress from the initial assessment through 12 months,
whereas distress relief for the taxane group began
significantly later, as indicated by a significant group
difference in quadratic change (P < .001) (see Table
2). Descriptively, no distress reduction was reported
by patients in the taxane group until 12 months. The
late model (30–60 months) demonstrated no change
over time in POMS and no significant group differences, as indicated by a nonsignificant group effect
for intercept (P 5 .429). Thus, from Year 3 though
Year 5, the groups reported reduced and comparable
levels of emotional distress.
Figure 3 provides data on patient reports of
depressive symptoms (CES-D). Figure 3a illustrates
the predicted trajectories for depressive symptoms
by group during the 2 periods. The early model
demonstrated that the groups were equivalent at diagnosis (P 5 .174), and this was followed again by
rapid improvement for the no-taxane group and significantly slower improvement for the taxane group
(P < .023). Like the POMS, the late model for the
CES-D demonstrated no change over time and no
difference between groups (P 5 .126). To determine
the clinical significance of the symptom reports, we
calculated the percentage of patients that reported a
clinically significant level of depressive symptoms (ie,
a CES-D Short Form score 10). The proportion of
patients in each group with clinical elevations
reported across time is illustrated in Figure 3b. Chisquare analysis indicated statistically significant
group differences at the 12-month (P 5 .013) and
18-month (P 5 .016) assessments and a trend at the
24-month assessment (P 5 .053).

SE indicates standard error; —,the parameter did not improve the model (based on the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayseian Information Criterion) and, thus, was not included in the final model.
* Intercept gives the estimate for the no-taxane group mean at Time 0. For early models, Time 0 indicates the pretreatment baseline. For late models, Time 0 was defined as the beginning of the late period, 30 months after baseline. P value indicates whether the estimate differed significantly from zero.

Slope provides an estimate of the average rate of change for the no-taxane group in units per month.
{
Quadratic provides an indication of acceleration or deceleration in rate of change. If the sign of the quadratic change parameter (positive or negative) matches the sign of the slope, then the rate of change is accelerating over time, with the majority of change occurring late
in the period. If the sign is the opposite of that of slope, then the majority of change occurred early in the period.

strated that the taxane group had more disruption of
physical quality of life at baseline (P 5 .050). Thereafter, both groups improved in a similar pattern,
with the rate of change slowing over time. The late
model demonstrated that both groups declined
slowly over Years 3 through 5 (P 5 .004). The groups
did not differ in the late model (P 5 .174). At all
time points in the late period, both groups were at
or within 1/2 standard deviation of the PCS norm
(ie, PCS 5 5022).
Figure 4b illustrates the trajectories for the MCS.
Like the POMS and CES-D, the early model demonstrated that the groups were similar at baseline
(P 5 .797), and there were differential changes thereafter. Patients in the taxane group recovered later
and more slowly than patients in the no-taxane
group (P < .006). There was, however, a significant
group difference observed in the late model.
Although similar at 30 months (P 5 .698), the groups
changed differentially over the follow-up period: The
no-taxane group had an increase and the taxane
group had a decline in mental quality of life
(P 5 .034). Again, the means for both groups in the

late model were estimated in the range of the normative mean (ie, MCS 5 5022).

Post-hoc Analyses
Post-hoc analyses were conducted to rule out alternative explanations for the findings. First, because
the taxane group initially reported significantly lower
physical quality of life than the no-taxane group, we
tested the hypothesis that physical functioning may
account for the differential psychological recovery. To
do so, multilevel model analyses were repeated using
concurrent nurse-rated functional status (KPS) as a
time-varying covariate. The results were identical to
those reported above for the POMS, CES-D, and
MCS. That is, controlling for concurrent functional
performance status, the taxane and no-taxane groups
were equivalent at baseline (all P > .061), but, once
again, they diverged, with patients in the taxane
group exhibiting delayed psychological recovery (all
P < .024). Among the late models, a slight divergence
of the groups in mental quality of life was observed
(P 5 .031), with decreasing quality of life for the taxane group. All other effects were nonsignificant, as in
the primary analyses. Thus, the greater impairments

in physical functioning of the taxane group at baseline did not appear to account for the psychological
differences between the groups at follow-up.
For current study, we used a convenience sample
of patients (N 5 138) who did or did not receive taxanes. However, there was a subset of patients
(n 5 46) enrolled in randomized trials that were testing the therapeutic efficacy of taxanes. Post hoc, we
repeated our analyses and included only those
patients who were randomized either to receive a
taxane (n 5 22 patients) or to a no-taxane arm
(n 5 24 patients). We then compared the effect sizes
of the differences between groups (Cohen d)
observed in all patients (N 5 138) with those
observed in analyses with the randomized patients
(see Table 3). The effect sizes for the subsample were
equivalent to those observed with all patients, and
differences between the estimates were minimal
(range, .01-.07). Thus, effects of the same magnitude
were observed in both randomized and nonrandomized samples. These data support the interpretation
that the observed differences between groups
resulted from the receipt of taxane therapy by some
patients rather than from other, unidentified differences.

Patients’ emotional and quality-of-life trajectories in
the years after taxane treatment have not been studied previously. These new data indicated that
patients who receive taxanes have significantly
slower psychological recovery after a diagnosis of
cancer. In fact, for patients in the taxane group, emotional ‘recovery’ required an average of 2 years compared with 6 to 12 months for patients in the notaxane comparison group. From a clinical perspective, there also were high rates of probable depression. Depressive symptoms, even when they are
severe, are not equivalent to a diagnosis of major
depression; however, it is noteworthy that the rates
of probable depression in the no-taxane group
declined to <10% by the 12-month follow-up assessment, whereas the rates in the taxane group
remained high at approximately 20%. National prevalence estimates for depression in women, as determined by diagnostic interview, range from 5% to
9%.23
The current data demonstrate, as have others,10–12
that patients who receive taxanes experience neurologic side effects to a greater extent than patients on
other regimens, including peripheral neuropathy,
ataxia, and neurotoxicity. However, the data also
highlight the limitations of toxicity documentation. It
has been suggested that standard toxicity assessments are inadequate to understand the impact of
adjuvant treatment on a patient’s quality of life.24,25
Indeed, the current psychological and quality-of-life
data provide an important context for the toxicity
findings. The group differences in quality of life and
emotional distress persisted for approximately 1 year
longer than the differences in nurse-rated toxicity.

Data such as these can provide an important contribution as the efficacy of the taxanes continues to be
evaluated.
A limitation of this study is the use of a convenience sample and the case–control design. The posthoc analyses with patients in randomized taxane
treatment trials, however, provide strong suggestive
evidence that the observed group differences were
not caused by an unmeasured variable. However, we
were not able to test for differential effects among
the taxanes (PTX and T). Additional research is
needed to determine whether taxanes produce different mood and quality-of-life disruption. Treatment
intent also may be important. For example, it is
known that T and PTX have a different spectrum of
toxicities when they are used to control metastatic
disease.26
Finally, we provide clinical observations. The
current data are useful because, to our knowledge,
no study has provided data on any psychosocial outcomes with taxanes beyond 6 months after adjuvant
treatment. Moreover, 5-year follow-up is unusual in
survivorship research. If these novel findings are confirmed in randomized trials, then monitoring of psychological symptoms would seem to be in order,
with referral of patients who become significantly
symptomatic. Currently, interventions are in development for preventing or treating the physical sequelae
of the taxanes. Results from a recent phase 2 clinical
trial, for example, suggested that vitamin E supplementation may reduce the risk of peripheral neuropathy from PTX.27 For patients with lesser, but still
significant, distress, psychological interventions tailored to the context of cancer are efficacious.28,29
Should the taxanes pose a risk for depression, it is
important for oncology professionals to be aware
that psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy are efficacious, but psychotherapy appears to be more effective in preventing a relapse of depression.30 In
closing, oncology professionals’ awareness of the
possibility of mood alteration with taxanes is important, because depression in cancer patients frequently is not recognized; and, even when it is
recognized, it may be under treated.31 The referral of
patients for the management of depressive sequelae
may need to become a more salient component of
comprehensive medical oncology care for patients
who receive taxanes.
