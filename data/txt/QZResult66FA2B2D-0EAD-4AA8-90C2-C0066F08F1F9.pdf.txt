ABSTRACT
SIRT3, a class III histone deacetylase, has been implicated in various cancers as
a novel therapeutic target. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we previously reported
that SIRT3 induced cell apoptosis by regulating GSK-3β/Bax signaling pathway.
Downregulation of SIRT3 in HCC cells facilitates tumor cell survival. In this study,
we found that chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin, cisplatin and epirubicin) and
sorafenib treatment downregulated SIRT3 mRNA and protein levels in three HCC
cell lines. MTS assay found that SIRT3 overexpression sensitized liver cancer cells
to chemotherapeutic agents and sorafenib in SMMC-7721, Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5
cell lines. Moreover, SIRT3 overexpression promoted chemotherapeutic agentsinduced or sorafenib-induced apoptosis as evidenced by flow cytometry, enhanced
PARP cleavage and enhanced Caspase-9 cleavage in three HCC cells. In contrast,
SIRT3 silencing increased drug resistance of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic agents.
Mechanistic study found that SIRT3 downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of
glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1), which is a member of phase II detoxification
enzymes families involved in metabolizing for chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover,
SIRT3 decreased the amount of GSTP1 that was associated with JNK, which finally
contributed the activation of JNK activity and activation of downstream target c-Jun
and Bim. Importantly, GSTP1 overexpression or JNK inhibitor abolished SIRT3-induced
apoptosis in HCC cells exposed to chemotherapeutic agents. Finally, there was a
negative correlation between SIRT3 expression and GSTP1 expression in human HCC
tissues. Together, our findings revealed SIRT3 could enhance the drug sensitivity of
HCC cells to an array of chemotherapeutic agents. SIRT3 may serve as a potential
target for improving the chemosensitivity of HCC patients.

with a high incidence rate of HCC. Current therapeutic
approaches for HCC include surgery, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy. Although curative surgery is the
most effective treatment, systemic chemotherapy on
postoperative HCC patients has also been carried out to
avoid recurrence and metastases. Doxorubicin, epirubicin,
cisplatin, Folfox scheme (oxaliplatin, leucovorin and
infusional fluorouracil (5-FU)) and sorafenib are so far the

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most
frequently occurring cancer worldwide, with over 782,000
new cases estimated to have occurred in 2012 [1]. There
are marked geographic variations in the distribution of
HCC, with most cases occurring in Eastern Asia and
sub-Saharan Africa [2]. China is one of the countries

commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. Unfortunately,
chemotherapeutic agents are modestly effective on HCC
and drug resistance is the major obstacle in the therapy.
Therefore, understanding of underlying mechanism
of drug resistance is urgently needed to identify novel
treatment.
Sirtuins, the class III histone deacetylases (HDACs),
are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidized form
(NAD+)-dependent deacetylases that target histone and
nonhistone protein [3, 4]. Mammalian sirtuins (SIRT1 to
SIRT7) has been implicated in a wide range of biological
processes such as metabolism, senescence, apoptosis,
DNA repair and carcinogenesis [5–10]. Among these
seven members, SIRT3 is generally believed to be a
mitochondrial deacetylase that functions as a regulator of
mitochondrial metabolic and oxidative stress regulatory
pathways. The loss of SIRT3 mitochondrial function can
cause cell damage, and provide an environment permissive
to carcinogenesis [11, 12]. Increasing evidences have
linked SIRT3 in tumor development. Aberrant expression
of SIRT3 is detected in breast cancer, oral cancer,
squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and hepatocellular
carcinoma [13–17].
We previously reported that SIRT3 was frequently
downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Ectopic
expression of SIRT3 induced cell apoptosis via the GSK3β/Bax signaling pathway in HCC cells [17]. In this study,
we found treatment of chemotherapeutic agents could
inhibit SIRT3 expression in serval HCC cell lines. Ectopic
expression SIRT3 sensitized HCC cells to treatment of
chemotherapeutic agents by modulating GSTP1/JNK
signaling pathway. Our data suggest a role for SIRT3 in
chemosensitivity of HCC cells.

cells which treated with a series of concentrations of
chemotherapeutic agents. Western blotting analysis
revealed that chemotherapeutic agents inhibited SIRT3
expression in HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 1E-1F). These data suggested that SIRT3 may play
a role in the drug sensitivity of HCC cells.

SIRT3 overexpression sensitized HCC cells to
chemotherapeutic agents
To examine the potential role of SIRT3 in resistance
to anticancer therapies of HCC, HCC cells were infected
with lentivirus expressing SIRT3 and then exposed to
various concentrations of doxorubicin, cisplatin and
epirubicin. SIRT3 was overexpressed markedly in all three
HCC cell lines examined (Figure 2A). MTS assay found
that SIRT3 overexpression significantly enhanced cellular
susceptibility to three chemotherapeutic agents in SMMC7721, Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells (Figure 2B-2D).
The sensitizing effect of SIRT3 of HCC cells was
further evidenced by flow cytometry and western blotting
analysis of several apoptotic markers. Although SIRT3
overexpression induced increased apoptosis rate in
untreated HCC cells, chemotherapeutic agents treatment
in SIRT3-overexpressing HCC cells resulted in a much
more increase in the apoptosis rate compared to their
respective control cells (Figure 3A-3C). Furthermore,
several apoptotic markers including cleaved-PARP and
cleaved-caspase 9 were analyzed. Concordantly, SIRT3
overexpression also increased expression of cleavedPARP, cleaved-caspase 9 in untreated HCC cells. However,
SIRT3 overexpression resulted in more increased level of
cleaved-PARP, cleaved-caspase 9 in chemotherapeutic
agents-treated HCC cells (Figure 3D-3F). We previously
reported that SIRT3 induces apoptosis in HCC cells
via activating Bax signaling [17]. In this study, we also
examine the effect of SIRT3 on Bax activation. SIRT3
overexpressing indeed induced the expression of Bax in
untreated HCC cells. However, SIRT3 had no effect on
Bax expression in chemotherapeutic agents-treated HCC
cells (Figure 3D-3F). Together, these data suggested that
SIRT3 may play a role in the regulation of drug sensitivity
in HCC cells independent on Bax-mediated signaling.

RESULTS
Chemotherapeutic agents inhibited SIRT3
expression in HCC cells
We first examined the expression of SIRT3 in three
HCC cell lines (SMMC-7721, Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5) and
one immortalized liver cell line (MIHA) by using qPCR
and western blotting analysis. The results showed that
both mRNA and protein levels of SIRT3 in HCC cell lines
were markedly lower relative to MIHA cells, indicating
that SIRT3 was frequently downregulated in HCC cells
(Figure 1A).
To determine whether chemotherapeutic agents
could alter SIRT3 expression, HCC cells were treated
with doxorubicin, cisplatin and epirubicin. Treatment of
chemotherapeutic agents significantly inhibited SIRT3
both mRNA and protein levels in SMMC-7721 cells
(Figure 1B). Similar decreased SIRT3 expression in
response to chemotherapeutic agents was also observed in
Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells (Figure 1C-1D). Furthermore,
the expression of SIRT3 was also examined in HCC

SIRT3 knockdown in HCC cells induced drug
resistance against chemotherapeutic agents
To further elucidate the role of SIRT3 in drug sensitivity
of HCC cells, HCC cells (SMMC-7721 and Huh-7) were
transfected with siRNA targeting SIRT3 and then exposed to
various concentrations of doxorubicin, cisplatin and epirubicin.
The silence of SIRT3 was measured by western blotting
(Supplementary Figure S1A). SIRT3 knockdown significantly
increased drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents examined
in both SMMC-7721 and Huh-7 cells (Supplementary

analysis revealed that sorafenib inhibited SIRT3 expression
in HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A).

which implicated in cellular resistance. To investigate
the underlying mechanism of chemosensitizing effect of
SIRT3, we examined the expression of GSTP1 in SIRT3overexpressing cells under treatment of chemotherapeutic
agents. QPCR results showed that SIRT3 overexpression
inhibited the mRNA level of GSTP1 in the three HCC
cells under treatment of chemotherapeutic agents
(Figure 5A). Moreover, ectopic expression of SIRT3

inhibited protein level of GSTP1 in HCC cells treated
with chemotherapeutic agents (Figure 5B). However,
SIRT3 overexpression has no effect on GSTP1 expression
in untreated control cells. To exclude the possibility
that chemotherapeutic agents have effect on GSTP1
expression, we detected mRNA and protein levels of
GSTP1 in HCC cells treated with chemotherapeutic
agents. Both qPCR and western blotting analysis found
that the chemotherapeutic agents had no effect on GSTP1
expression (Supplementary Figure S2). Overall, these
data suggested that GSTP1 may be involved in the drug
sensitivity mediated by SIRT3 in HCC cells.
GSTP1 has been shown to associate with c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways involved in cell
survival and death signaling. The interaction between
GSTP1 and JNK inhibits the kinase activity of JNK, which
finally results in the inactivation of c-Jun, a component
of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor. The
activation of AP-1 leads to induction of AP-1-dependent
target genes involved in cell death [20]. Therefore, we
further analyzed JNK signaling pathway in SIRT3overexpressing cells. SIRT3 overexpression promoted the
phosphorylation status of JNK whereas it had no effect on
total JNK expression in all three HCC cells (SMMC-7721,
Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5) treated with chemotherapeutic
agents (Figure 5C-5E). Moreover, SIRT3 overexpression
resulted in increased level of phosphorylated-c-Jun and
Bim which is downstream target of AP-1 in HCC cells
exposed to chemotherapeutic agents (Figure 5C-5E).
However, SIRT3 also did not change the expression of
JNK, p-JNK, c- Jun, p-c-Jun and Bim in untreated control
cells. We further examined whether SIRT3 could affect
the association between GSTP1 and JNK by using coimmunoprecipitation assay. Our data showed that SIRT3
overexpression decreased the amount of GSTP1 that
was associated with JNK (Figure 5F). Taken together,
these data suggested that under chemotherapeutic agents
treatment, SIRT3 inhibited GSTP1 expression, which
resulted in decreased GSTP1 interacting with JNK. The
interaction of the GSTP1: JNK complex dissociated in
SIRT3-overexpressing HCC cells finally contributed the
activation of JNK activity and activation of downstream
target c-Jun.

Figure S3A). Consistently, PARP cleavage analysis
confirmed that GSTP1 expression abolished SIRT3induced apoptosis in HCC cells exposed to doxorubicin,
cisplatin and epirubicin (Figure 6B). However, GSTP1
overexpression in untreated HCC cells had no effect
on SIRT3-induced apoptosis (Figure 6A-6B). We also
treated HCC cells expressing SIRT3 with SP600125,
a specific JNK inhibitor. Flow cytometry revealed that
treatment of SP600125 had no effect on SIRT3-induced
apoptosis in untreated HCC cells while it abolished cell
apoptosis induced by SIRT3 in HCC cells exposed to
chemotherapeutic agents (Figure 6C and Supplementary
Figure S3B). Altogether, these data suggested SIRT3 could
increase drug sensitivity of HCC cells to anticancer agents
via GSTP1 signaling pathway.

The correlation between SIRT3 and GSTP1 in
HCC tissues
Finally, we analyzed the relevance of SIRT3
and GSTP1 expression in 60 paired HCC tissues by
using qPCR and western blotting analysis. Correlative
analysis revealed a negative correlation between SIRT3
mRNA and GSTP1 mRNA levels (Spearman’s rank=0.406, p=0.0005) (Figure 7A). Moreover, SIRT3 protein
level negatively correlated with GSTP1 protein level
(Spearman’s rank=-0.445, p=0.0004) (Figure 7B-7C).
These data suggested that the SIRT3-GSTP1 regulatory
axis might exist in vivo.

DISCUSSION
SIRT3, the primary mitochondrial deacetylase in
sirtuins family, regulates metabolism, ATP generation, aging,
cell survival and death, and carcinogenesis [11, 21]. The
role of SIRT3 in carcinogenesis is controversial. Allison and
colleagues found that SIRT3 is required for apoptosis induced
by selectively silencing Bcl-2 in HCT116 human epithelial
cancer cells [22]. Also, Schumacker et al demonstrated
SIRT3 suppresses the proliferation and survival of tumor cells
through its effect on inhibits ROS production, as well as HIF1a stabilization and its downstream transcriptional activity,
thereby decreasing tumorigenesis [23]. On the contrary, SIRT3
is overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC),
and down-regulation of it inhibited OSCC cell growth and
proliferation in vitro and in vivo [14]. High expression of
SIRT3 is associated with shorter survival time in esophageal
cancer patients [24]. Therefore, the role of SIRT3 in neoplasia
is cell type-specific, and potentially quite complex. Recently,
emerging evidences have implicated the function of SIRT3
in drug resistance. Kaempferol treatment increased the
expression and the mitochondria localization of the SIRT3 in
chronic myelogenous leukemia cell K562. K562 cells stably
overexpressing SIRT3 were more sensitive to kaempferol
treatment [25]. SIRT3 altered sensitivity of breast cancer cells
to tamoxifen (Tam), a commonly used anti-estrogen agent.

GSTP1 overexpression or JNK inhibitor
attenuate the sensitizing effect of SIRT3
To further determine whether SIRT3 exerts its
function by modulating GSTP1 signaling pathway, we
overexpressed GSTP1 in SMMC-7721 and Huh-7 cells
stably expressing SIRT3. The apoptosis ratios of HCC cells
were detected by both flow cytometry and PARP cleavage.
Importantly, these cells treated with chemotherapeutic
agents showed a significant reduction in apoptosis rate
compared with cells ectopically expressing SIRT3 without
GSTP1 overexpression (Figure 6A and Supplementary

SIRT3 was rapidly up-regulated in the Tam-sensitive MCF7 cells following exposure to Tam. SIRT3 overexpression in
MCF-7 cells decreased cellular sensitivity to Tam and blocked
the Tam-induced apoptosis [26]. Moreover, SIRT3 protects
cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin-induced oxidative damage

by attenuating DOX-induced ROS production and rescuing
mitochondrial respiration [27]. In HCC cells, we previously
reported SIRT3 was frequently downregulated in HCC tissues
and cell lines. SIRT3 overexpression significantly induced
cell apoptosis in several HCC cell lines [17]. However, the

role of SIRT3 in drug sensitivity of liver cancer cells remains
elusive. In this study, we first found that chemotherapeutic
agents (doxorubicin, cisplatin and epirubicin) and sorafenib
treatment downregulated SIRT3 mRNA and protein levels in
three HCC cell lines, which suggesting SIRT3 might play a
regulatory role in drug sensitivity of HCC cells. MTS assay
further confirmed that SIRT3 overexpression sensitized liver
cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents and sorafenib in
SMMC-7721, Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5 cell lines. Moreover,
SIRT3 overexpression promoted chemotherapeutic agentsinduced or sorafenib induced-apoptosis as evidenced by flow
cytometry and enhanced PARP cleavage. Taken together,
these results indicated the sensitizing effect of SIRT3 in

chemotherapy in HCC. This finding may provide a possibility
to combine SIRT3 activator together with chemotherapeutic
agents as a novel treatment strategy for HCC. However, the
results are still preliminary, and the synergistic role of SIRT3
activator in chemotherapy of HCC needs to be determined in
animal models.
Mechanistic study of SIRT3-medicated chemose­
nsitization was further investigated. We revealed that SIRT3
downregulated Glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1)
expression, which is a member of glutathione S-transferases
(GSTs) family. GSTs belong to a superfamily of phase
II detoxification enzymes that catalyze the conjugation
of glutathione (GSH) to a wide variety endogenous and

exogenous electrophilic compounds [28]. Human GSTs are
divided into three families: cytosolic GSTs, mitochondrial
GSTs and membrane-bound microsomal GSTs. GSTP1 is
the most closely cytosolic GSTs that related to carcinogenesis
and drug resistance [29]. GSTP1 overexpression have been
reported in many cancers, such as breast cancer, colon cancer,
kidney cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer [20]. The
sensitivity of these tumors toward chemotherapeutic agents,
including cisplatin, doxorubicin and epirubicin, are negatively
regulated by overexpression of GSTP1 [30–32]. In HCC,
dysregulation of GSTP1 was observed in liver cancer cell lines
[33], and in more than 77.8% of HBV-associated HCC tissues
[34]. Chen and colleagues found that AG and GG genotypes
of GSTP1 gene increased the risk of HCC [35]. Recently, a
meta-analysis indicated a significant association between
GSTP1 methylation and poor outcomes in HCC patients
[36]. In this study, we found that SIRT3 decreased GSTP1
in both mRNA and protein levels which suggested SIRT3
regulated GSTP1, at least in part, occurs at a transcriptional
level in liver cancer cells. This finding led us to hypothesize
that SIRT3 may selectively controlled key factors involved
in DNA methylation, histone modification and chromosome
remodeling which affect GSTP1 gene transcription. In addition
to GSH-conjugating activity, GSTP1 has been shown to
associate with the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) pathways
involved in cell survival and death signaling. GSTP1 functions
to sequester the JNK kinase in a complex, thus preventing it
from acting on downstream targets [20, 28]. In this study, we
found that SIRT3 overexpression decreased the expression
of GSTP1 associated with JNK, finally contributed the
activation of JNK activity and activation of downstream target
c-Jun. Importantly, GSTP1 overexpression or JNK inhibitor
abolished SIRT3-induced apoptosis in HCC cells exposed
to chemotherapeutic agents or sorafenib. Taken together,
these data suggested that SIRT3 could sensitize HCC cells to
chemotherapeutic agents via GSTP1/JNK signaling pathway.
In summary, we have identified a novel SIRT3/
GSTP1/JNK pathway orchestrating cell death evasion and
sensitivity to chemotherapy in HCC cells. In HCC cells,
downregulation of SIRT3 facilitated cell death evasion and
drug resistance to chemotherapy. Ectopic expression of
SIRT3 not only induced cell apoptosis but also increased
drug sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in HCC cells.
Therefore, SIRT3 is a promising target in combination with
chemotherapy or targeting therapies for HCC in future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and transfection
Immortalized liver cell line (MIHA) and hepatocellular
carcinoma cell lines (SMMC-7721, Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5)
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA),
100U/ml penicillin and 100ug/ml streptomycin (Thermo,
USA). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator

were determined using the BCA Protein Assay (Thermo,
USA). Total proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE
Healthcare, UK). Western blotting analysis was performed
with the indicated primary antibodies and then with
horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies.
The blots were developed with immobilon western
chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore, USA).

Cells were harvested and total proteins were
extracted as mentioned above. After determining protein
concentrations, 500 μg of the total proteins lysate was
brought to a final volume of 1 ml with RIPA. Crude cell
extracts were precleared with Protein G Magnetic Beads
(Millipore, USA) for 60 min at 4 °C. Indicated primary
antibodies and IgG were added respectively into the
lysates and incubated with constant rotation overnight
at 4 °C. Protein G Magnetic Beads were then incubated
to capture the added antibody for 120 min at room
temperature. Captured immunoprecipitates were washed
three times with PBS (add 0.1% tween-20) buffer and one
time with diluted buffer. Then, the immunoprecipitates
were suspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for
immunoblot analysis.
