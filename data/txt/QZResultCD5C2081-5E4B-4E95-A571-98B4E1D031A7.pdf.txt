and the mechanism of melanoma drug resistance, which limits
effective therapy, is not understood.
The major cytotoxic effect of cDDP is thought to be mediated by
translocation of the drug to the nucleus, followed by formation of
platinum-DNA adducts. This DNA damage triggers signaling
cascades leading to long-term growth arrest and mitotic catastrophe and to apoptosis of the cell (5). Whereas many possible
mechanisms of drug resistance have been proposed, no cohesive
picture has emerged. One proposed mechanism is the decrease of
the accessibility of cis-platin to target molecules, such as DNA, by
decreasing intracytoplasmic and intranuclear accumulation of
cis-platin, which could occur through a number of ways, including
transporter-mediated drug efflux from cells (6) or via sequestration
into intracellular organelles (7–9).
Melanosomes are unique intracellular organelles found in
melanomas and melanocytes, in which the pigment melanin is
synthesized and stored before regulated secretion. Melanosomes
undergo a well-characterized series of morphologically recognizable maturational stages during formation (10, 11). Stage I is
characterized by intralumenal vesicles; stage II develops an elliptic
shape and intralumenal longitudinal fibrils; stage III has evidence
of pigment deposition along the fibrils; stage IV melanosomes are
filled with pigment, obscuring the fibrils completely (see Fig. 1C).
Regulation of melanosome formation is influenced by proteins that
direct protein traffic to the melanosome, such as the HermanskyPudlak syndrome (HPS) proteins (12); structural melanosomal
proteins, such as gp100/Pmel17 (13–15); and melanosomal integral
membrane proteins, such as tyrosinase (16). Melanosome structure
is impaired by mutations in genes defective in HPS (17, 18), and it
has been shown that mutations in gp100/Pmel17 also disrupt
melanosome biogenesis (15) and that defects in tyrosinase cause
melanosome biogenesis to be blocked (16).
Recently, it was shown that an epithelioid tumor lacking
melanosomes was susceptible to cDDP compared with a melanoma
with melanosomes and that a melanoma with immature melanosomes was more susceptible to cDDP compared with melanomas
with mature melanosomes. In the nonmelanoma cells, cDDP
accumulated in the nucleus, whereas in melanoma cells, it was
found in melanosomes, with very little in the nucleus (19). The
sequestration of cDDP into melanosomes had the effect of
diverting cDDP from accumulating in the nucleus, likely preventing
interaction with target DNA. Although this previous study showed
an association between cDDP resistance in melanomas and
sequestration of the drug into melanosomes, a direct demonstration of the dependence of cDDP resistance on the presence of
melanosomes was lacking.

Abstract
Whereas resistance to chemotherapy has long impeded
effective treatment of metastatic melanoma, the mechanistic
basis of this resistance remains unknown. One possible
mechanism of drug resistance is alteration of intracellular
drug distribution either by drug efflux or sequestration into
intracellular organelles. Melanomas, as well as primary
melanocytes from which they arise, have intracellular organelles, called melanosomes, wherein the synthesis and storage
of the pigment melanin takes place. In this study, comparisons
of congenic cells with and without functional molecules
regulating melanosome formation show that sensitivity to
the chemotherapeutic agent cis-diaminedichloroplatinum II
(cis-platin) significantly increases with the mutation of genes
regulating melanosome formation, concomitant disruption of
melanosome morphology, and loss of mature melanosomes.
Absence of the melanosomal structural protein gp100/Pmel17
causes increased cis-platin sensitivity. Independent mutations
in three separate genes that regulate melanosome biogenesis
(Dtnbp1, Pldn, Vps33a) also result in increased cis-platin
sensitivity. In addition, a mutation of the gene encoding the
integral melanosomal protein tyrosinase, resulting in aberrant melanosome formation, also causes increased cis-platin
sensitivity. Furthermore, sensitivity to agents in other chemotherapeutic classes (e.g., vinblastine and etoposide) also
increased with the mutation of Pldn. In contrast, a mutation
in another melanosomal regulatory gene, Hps1, minimally
affects melanosome biogenesis, preserves the formation of
mature melanosomes, and has no effect on cis-platin or
vinblastine response. Together, these data provide the first
direct evidence that melanosomal regulatory genes influence
drug sensitivity and that the presence of mature melanosomes
likely contributes to melanoma resistance to therapy. [Cancer
Res 2009;69(3):992–9]

Introduction
The treatment of metastatic melanoma has been hampered by
broad resistance of tumor cells to therapy. This is in contrast to
many other cancers that are amenable to treatment with agents
such as cis-diaminedichloroplatinum II (cDDP; cis-platin), which is
effective against most common cancers and is used in first or
second line combination therapy for melanoma with some
response (1).3 However, currently, no standard therapeutic regimen
provides any clinical prolongation of patient survival rate (2–4),

plated at three to four specimens per T185-cm2 flask (Nunc) in 154 medium
with 0.07 mmol/L Ca2+ and human keratinocyte growth supplement
(Cascade Biologics) to allow a keratinocyte feeder layer to grow. The
medium was changed after 3 to 4 d to 254 with human melanocyte growth
supplement (Cascade Biologics). The cells were fed every 2 to 3 d for 10 to
11 d and then passed to remove any remaining keratinocytes. The cells were
maintained at 37jC and 5% CO2.
Electron microscopy. Cells were scraped from culture dishes, pelleted,
and fixed for 15 min in modified Karnovsky’s fixative [0.1 mol/L cacodylate/
2% paraformaldehyde/2% gluteraldehyde/0.06% calcium chloride (pH 7.4)].
The pellets were then carefully dislodged and turned over to allow
penetration of fixative from all sides for another 30 min, followed by a
postfixation in reduced osmium [2% osmium tetroxide/1.5% potassium
ferrocyanide/0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4)]. Cell pellets were washed
thrice in double-distilled water and postfixed in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate
for 1 h at 4jC. Finally, samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol and
embedded in Epon resin. Sixty-nanometer sections were collected on
formvar-coated copper grids (Ted Pella, Inc.) and counterstained with
saturated uranyl acetate in 70% methanol and lead citrate. Samples were
visualized with a Zeiss 10C/CR electron microscope. All reagents were
purchased at Electron Microscopy Sciences, except for calcium chloride and
potassium ferrocyanide (Sigma), as well as ethanol and methanol (Fisher
Scientific).

Here, we show, by using three systems of congenic cells (human
melanoma cells with and without gp100/Pmel17 and primary
melanocytes derived from mouse models of HPS or having
defective tyrosinase, all of which have impaired melanosome
biogenesis), that mutation of genes regulating melanosome
formation significantly increases the susceptibility of cells to cDDP
and that these genes play a fundamental role in influencing cell
response to chemotherapy. This work is the first direct evidence
that genes functioning along the pathway of melanosome
biogenesis potentially provide novel targets for adjuvant melanoma
therapy to modulate drug sensitivity.

Materials and Methods
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide proliferation assay. Cells were plated at 200 to 5,000 per well in a 96-well flatbottomed plate and incubated for 24 to 48 h; then medium was removed,
and cDDP (Sigma) or plain medium was added. After 3 to 6 d, medium with
drug was removed and 10 AL/100 AL medium of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), as supplied by the kit
manufacturer [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)], were added.
Plates were incubated for an additional 6 h, and then 100 AL of detergent
reagent supplied by the kit were added. After an overnight incubation
at room temperature in the dark, absorbance was recorded at 540 nm.
Cell number was determined using a standard curve. Percentage of cells
proliferating was calculated with the following equation: % cell proliferation
= C PT / C 0  100, wherein C 0 = cell number without drug treatment and
C PT = cell number post–drug treatment. Each graph shown is representative
of at least three separate experiments.
Cell culture. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen,
unless otherwise noted. MNT-1 human melanoma cells (gift of Dr. Vincent
Hearing) were cultured in advanced DMEM [+4,500 mg/L D-glucose,
nonessential amino acids (NEAA), 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate], supplemented with AIM-V (10%), fetal bovine serum (FBS; 20%), glutamine
(2 mmol/L), penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL), and fungizone (2.5 Ag/
mL). SK-MEL-24 human melanoma cells (ATCC) were cultured in EMEM
(Lonza Aalkersville, Inc.; +Earle’s buffered saline solution, NEAA, 110 mg/L
sodium pyruvate) supplemented with FBS (15%) and glutamine (2 mmol/L).
HeLa cells (ATCC) were cultured in EMEM (+EBSS, +NEAA, +sodium
pyruvate) supplemented with FBS (10%) and glutamine (2 mmol/L). MelFB
human melanoma cells (gift of Dr. Rejean Lapointe) were cultured in RPMI
1640 supplemented with FBS (10%), glutamine (2 mmol/L), penicillinstreptomycin (100 units/mL), and gentamicin (10 Ag/mL). B16 murine
melanoma cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS and glutamine. Primary melanocytes were established in cell culture
from skin tissue of neonatal mice using a method modified from a protocol
to culture human keratinocytes (20). Mice were maintained in an American
Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–accredited
facility, and all protocols were approved by the San Francisco VA
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Neonatal mice not older
than 3 d were decapitated, and the bodies were washed twice in 10%
Hibiclens (Stuart Pharmaceuticals) in water. The specimens were then
washed thrice in PBS containing 50 Ag/mL Fungizone [University of
California-San Francisco (UCSF) Cell Culture Facility] and penicillin G
(2,000 units/mL)/streptomycin (2,000 Ag/mL; UCSF Cell Culture Facility).
The dorsal back skin was isolated with forceps and then washed thrice in
the same concentration of penicillin/streptomycin/Fungizone in PBS and
once with a lower concentration [penicillin (500 units/mL)/streptomycin
(500 Ag/mL)/Fungizone (10 Ag/mL)]. The samples were then incubated
in HBSS (UCSF Cell Culture Facility) with dispase (BD Biosciences;
2,500 caseinolytic units) and gentamicin (500 Ag/mL; Cellgro Mediatech)
overnight at 4jC. The epidermis was separated from the dermis with
forceps and incubated in 0.05% trpysin/EDTA (Life Technologies Invitrogen)
for 10 to 12 min at 37jC. The trypsin was neutralized by adding twice
the volume of HBSS with 5% FBS (Hyclone). The cells were pelleted by
centrifugation, and trypsin was removed by aspiration. The cells were

Results
The presence of mature (versus immature) melanosomes is
associated with increased resistance to cDDP. First, we sought
to confirm the findings that cDDP resistance is associated with the
presence of melanosomes. When the HeLa neoplastic cell line
lacking melanosomes was treated with cDDP, it was found to be
more susceptible to the cDDP effect (Fig. 1A) compared with the
MNT-1 melanoma cell line, which is well-characterized to have all
four stages of melanosome biogenesis (ref. 21; also Fig. 1B). Next,
it was confirmed that the state of maturity of intracellular
melanosomes affected the sensitivity to cDDP of a melanoma cell
line. SK-MEL-24 human melanoma cells only have immature
melanosomes (Fig. 1B). When incubated with cDDP, SK-MEL-24
cells were more susceptible to the drug effect compared with MNT-1
cells, as shown in Fig. 1D and E.
These studies confirm the correlation of the presence of mature
melanosomes with cDDP resistance, as previously reported (19).
However, these comparisons by us and others (19) are of melanoma
and nonmelanoma tumors from unrelated patients with differing
genetic backgrounds and, thus, do not provide direct evidence for
the dependence of cDDP resistance on the presence of melanosomes because the effects of background genes cannot be
discounted. To address this issue, we next compared the cDDP
sensitivity of parental cells (with mature melanosomes) with that of
congenic mutant cells (with disrupted melanosome biogenesis
caused by a single-gene mutation) to establish that increased cDDP
sensitivity is specifically attributable to mutation in a single gene
affecting melanosome biogenesis.
Absence of the melanosomal structural protein gp100/
Pmel17 results in increased cDDP sensitivity. The molecule
gp100/Pmel17 is known to play a critical role in melanosome
biogenesis (22), and in the absence of gp100/Pmel17, melanosome
biogenesis is impaired (13, 15). Therefore, the effect of the presence
and absence of gp100/Pmel17 in congenic human melanoma cells
on cDDP resistance was tested, with the prediction that the lack
of gp100/Pmel17 would cause increased cDDP sensitivity. The
melanoma MelFB lost gp100/Pmel17 expression through immunoselection. The congenic cell line MelFB + gp100/Pmel17 was

melanoma cells with mature melanosomes are resistant to cDDP
in a similar manner to human melanoma cells. B16 is a mouse
melanoma cell line with melanosomes morphologically similar to
those in the human MNT-1 melanoma; B16 is derived from the
C57BL/6 mouse, as are the HPS mice whose melanocytes were
subsequently examined (data shown below; refs. 17, 18). Figure 3
shows that the B16 mouse melanoma cells are more similar to
the human melanoma MNT-1 in resistance to cDDP than to the
human melanoma SK-MEL-24, as expected, correlating with the
presence of more mature melanosomes in both B16 and MNT-1
(versus immature melanosomes in SK-MEL-24). This result
indicated that the mechanism for cDDP resistance may be similar
in human and mouse cells and that mouse models of defective
melanosome biogenesis are likely useful and applicable models to
investigate the basis for cDDP resistance.

derived from MelFB by the transduction of gp100/Pmel17 into
MelFB; another congenic cell line MelFB
gp100/Pmel17 was
generated by transducing MelFB with a control vector encoding the
green fluorescent protein (23). Figure 2 shows that absence of
gp100/Pmel17 results in an increase in cDDP sensitivity compared
with in the presence of gp100/Pmel17, providing the first direct
evidence that disruption of the process of normal melanosome
biogenesis increases sensitivity to cDDP.
We then sought further direct evidence in another congenic
system, mouse models of diseases caused by genes that disrupt
melanosome biogenesis; all of these murine strains share the
common genetic background of the parental C57BL/6 mouse
strain.
Mouse melanoma cells with mature melanosomes are
resistant to cDDP. First, it was determined whether mouse

(without melanosomes) were plated in

concentrations of cDDP for 3 d. Cell
proliferation was measured using MTT cell
proliferation assay (44–46). Percentage
of cell proliferation was calculated as
indicated under Materials and Methods.

MNT-1 (stage IV) and SK-MEL-24 (stage I)
melanoma cells. Scale bar, 1.0 Am.
C, melanosome maturation occurs via four
morphologically distinct stages. Transition
from stages I to II depends on the function
of the structural protein gp100/Pmel17 for
formation of longitudinal fibrils. Maturation
also depends on the function of HPS
proteins pallidin, dysbindin, and vps33a,
which regulate protein targeting to the
melanosome. Transition from stages II to III
depends on the rate-limiting enzyme
tyrosinase, which functions in pigment
synthesis and contributes to melanosome
structure. Mouse strains defective in the
respective HPS proteins are noted in
parentheses. D, cells were plated as in A
and treated with cDDP for 6 d. Cell
proliferation was measured using the MTT
assay. E, cells were incubated with cDDP
for 6 d before being photographed.
Beginning at 1 Amol/L cDDP, SK-MEL-24
cells are more severely affected compared
with MNT-1 cells; shown is the marked
effect of 2 Amol/L cDDP on SK-MEL-24
compared with minimal effect on MNT-1.
Note that MNT-1 cells are highly pigmented
compared with SK-MEL-24 cells and that
the dark appearing cells in the image of
SK-MEL-24 cells treated with 2 Amol/L
cDDP are nonviable cells.

seriously impaired melanosome biogenesis (ref. 18; see also Fig. 4A)
and show increased drug sensitivity when incubated with cDDP
(Fig. 4C).
In contrast, our previously published data showed that, in
melanocytes from the HPS pale ear mouse strain (ep/ep), stage IV
melanosomes are formed but at a slower rate than that seen in
the parental congenic C57BL/6 strain (17). Thus, although the rate
of melanosome biogenesis is decreased, stage IV melanosomes
are present and functional. Cells from pale ear mice were tested for
cDDP sensitivity. Figure 4A and D shows that ep/ep melanocytes
have melanosomes with the same stage IV morphology as parental
congenic C57BL/6 cells and also have the same resistance to cDDP
as do the C57BL/6 cells, consistent with the presence of mature
melanosomes conferring resistance to cDDP.
Defect in the melanosomal integral membrane protein
tyrosinase disrupts melanosome biogenesis and results in
increased cDDP sensitivity. We next sought to determine if
defects in a third type of molecule, an integral membrane protein
known to influence melanosome formation, would also affect
cDDP resistance. Tyrosinase is the rate-limiting enzyme for
melanin synthesis and a transmembrane protein localized in the
melanosome limiting membrane. Without functional tyrosinase,
melanosome morphology is disrupted (16) and a disproportionate
number of stage I melanosomes are observed compared with in
congenic C576BL/6 melanocytes (Fig. 5A). Melanocytes from the
tyrosinase mutant mouse C57BL/6J-Tyrc-2J were tested for cDDP
sensitivity. Figure 5B shows that mutation of the tyrosinase gene
results in an increase in cDDP sensitivity.
The above data establish that mutations in five separate and
independent genes that regulate melanosome formation in three
different congenic systems result in increased sensitivity to cDDP
together with disruption of melanosome formation. Altogether,
these data are the first to show a functional role for melanosomal
regulatory genes in cDDP resistance.
Mutation of the melanosomal regulatory gene Pldn results
in increased sensitivity to vinblastine and etoposide. Finally, we
asked if the increased sensitivity to cDDP could be generalized to
other chemotherapeutic agents with different modes of cytotoxicity. We tested two other agents as representatives of two other

Figure 2. Absence of melanosomal structural protein Pmel17 results in a
decreased cDDP resistance. MelFB gp100/Pmel17 human melanoma cells
lack gp100/Pmel17 expression and are more sensitive to cDDP compared with
the congenic cell line MelFB + gp100/Pmel17, in which gp100/Pmel17 has been
transduced. Cells were plated and treated as in Fig. 1A.

Mutations in HPS genes that significantly disrupt melanosome biogenesis result in increased cDDP sensitivity. Mutations in HPS genes have been shown to cause quantifiable and
characteristic blocks along various points of the pathway of
melanosome biogenesis (17, 18). Thus, it was decided to test if
separate and independent mutations in HPS genes, which disrupt
melanosome biogenesis, also result in increased cDDP sensitivity
compared with control cells with intact melanosome biogenesis.
Because the melanocytes tested were derived from mouse strains
that are all congenic, due to sharing of the C57BL/6 genetic
background, the cDDP sensitivity effect can confidently be
attributed to specific gene mutations. The mouse gene mutations
noted below are all autosomal recessive; each defective gene has
been sequenced, and the mutations were identified (12).
The mouse strain sandy (sdy/sdy) has a mutation in the Dtnbp1
gene, encoding the dysbindin protein (24). The pallid mouse strain
(pa/pa) has a mutation in the Pldn gene encoding the pallidin
protein (25). Both pallidin and dysbindin are subunits of the
BLOC-1 multiprotein complex, which associates with the cytoplasmic face of endosomal membranes. Whereas the exact function of
both proteins remains unknown, defects in either one lead to
mistrafficking of selected proteins normally targeted to the
melanosome (24, 26–29), and this results in melanocytes with
significantly impaired melanosome biogenesis (refs. 17, 18; see also
Fig. 4A). Pallid melanocytes with defective melanosomes incubated
with cDDP showed increased drug sensitivity compared with
congenic C57BL/6 melanocytes with normal stage IV melanosomes. Melanocytes from sandy mice, also with defective
melanosomes, similarly showed increased cDDP sensitivity when
compared with C57BL/6 melanocytes (Fig. 4B).
The buff mouse strain (buf/buf) has a mutation in the Vps33a
gene, which is implicated in protein trafficking to the melanosome
and lysosome, an intracellular organelle closely related to the
melanosome (30, 31).4 Melanocytes from buff mice also have

enhanced when the function of regulators of melanosome
biogenesis is disrupted.
These results suggest that the presence of mature melanosomes
confers and is causally related to increased resistance to cDDP,
vinblastine, and etoposide. How might this effect be mediated?
It was previously shown that cDDP can be sequestered into
melanosomes, shifting intracellular distribution away from the
nucleus and decreasing drug accessibility to target DNA (19), and it
is possible that melanosomal accumulation of cDDP is mediated by
transporter molecules, several of which have been localized to the
melanosome by proteomic methods (32–34). It is also possible that
cDDP is directly internalized from the extracellular milieu into
melanosomes via endocytosis or phagocytosis, thus bypassing a
cytoplasm to nucleus route. Supporting this is data showing
that platinum compounds can be internalized via phagocytosis
and that cells with impaired endocytosis have decreased
intracellular accumulation of cDDP (35, 36). Melanosome sequestration may act as a resistance modulator for other compounds,
in addition to cDDP, through other drug-specific mechanisms. It
has been previously shown that the pigment melanin found in
mature, but not in immature, melanosomes can bind to
chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin and doxorubicin,
thus decreasing in vitro drug activity; this binding effect was not
found for cDDP (37).
Disrupting melanosome biogenesis could affect the above
mechanisms in several ways. Defects in the HPS proteins, which
influence protein trafficking to the melanosome, could impair
transporter molecule targeting or the targeting of other molecules
essential for the resistance function to the melanosome. Lack of the
functional gp100/Pmel17 molecule or the integral membrane
protein tyrosinase could affect the stability of the resulting
immature melanosomes, leading to decreased numbers of melanosomes available to sequester drug. Also, both gp100/Pmel17 and

classes of drugs: vinblastine, a microtubule poison, and etoposide,
which targets topoisomerase. We found that mutation of the
HPS Pldn gene also increased sensitivity to vinblastine, whereas
mutation to the Hps1/ep gene, which preserves the formation
of mature melanosomes, has no effect on the response to
vinblastine. Increased sensitivity was also observed when cells
were incubated with etoposide (Fig. 6). Thus, mutations of
melanosomal regulatory genes that disrupt melanosome formation
increase cell sensitivity to representatives of at least three classes of
chemotherapeutic agents, whereas mutation of a regulatory gene
that does not affect mature melanosome formation has no effect
on drug sensitivity.

Discussion
These data show that genes regulating the formation of mature
melanosomes can modulate drug resistance. HeLa cancer cells
without melanosomes are more sensitive to cDDP compared with
human melanoma cells with mature melanosomes, and melanoma
cells with immature melanosomes show increased sensitivity to
cDDP compared with melanoma cells with mature melanosomes.
These findings confirm a recent report that previously showed
similar results (19). Furthermore, our comparisons of congenic sets
of cells show that independent mutations in three separate genes
that regulate protein trafficking to melanosomes, Dtnbp1, Pldn, and
Vps33a, result in disruption of melanosome biogenesis and
concurrent increased drug sensitivity. Absence of the melanosomal
structural protein gp100/Pmel17 also results in increased cDDP
sensitivity. And finally, mutation in the gene encoding the
melanosomal integral membrane protein tyrosinase results in
disruption of melanosome biogenesis, as well as increased cDDP
sensitivity. Altogether, the data clearly establish that sensitivity to
the chemotherapeutic agents cDDP, vinblastine, and etoposide is

ing the chemoresistance mediated by these genes remains to be
further investigated.
One question that arises with respect to tumor drug resistance is
the potential role of tumor-initiating cells or stem cells. Melanoma
stem cells might a priori thought to be lacking melanosomes and,
thus, would be predicted to be relatively susceptible to drug
therapy; this prediction is seemingly contradicted by the stout
resistance of clinical tumors to treatment. However, it has been
shown that when melanoma cells are incubated with cis-platin, an
increased number of melanosomes is induced, and evidence
suggests that other agents, such as vinblastine, etoposide, and

used to treat patients with nonmelanoma cancers is a generalized

and, so, are overall more resistant to cDDP compared with melanoma cells.

tyrosinase are known to form complexes with other molecules
targeted to the melanosome (e.g., MART-1 and Tyrp1, respectively;
refs. 38, 39), so it is possible that the lack of gp100/Pmel17 or
tyrosinase affects targeting or function of these and other
molecules, contributing to the decreased resistance phenotype.
The mechanism of cDDP cytotoxicity is thought to be
multifactorial and probably hinges on platination of DNA and/or
protein molecules. Sequestration into melanosomes would be a
mechanism by which a drug could be isolated from all cytoplasmic
and nuclear targets and could explain melanoma resistance to a
broad spectrum of cytotoxic drugs with differing modes of action
on varying target molecules. Sequestered drug could be stored,
detoxified by glutathione (40), and/or exocytosed and released into
the extracellular milieu (9). Supporting this last possibility is
evidence showing that, when cultured melanomas were exposed to
cDDP, an increased number of melanosomes were exocytosed and
secreted into the media (19).
Although we show here that the regulators of melanosome
formation influence drug sensitivity, we do not eliminate the
possibility that these regulators could mediate drug response via
mechanisms alternative to or in addition to melanosome function.
It is possible that melanosomal genes have regulatory functions in
addition to regulating melanosome formation. For example, they
may regulate the formation of other organelles, such as autophagosomes, which might play a role in melanoma chemoresistance.
Alternatively, these genes may play a role in cell cycle checkpoint
response or apoptotic response. The exact mechanism(s) underly-

(Figs. 1D and 2) suggest that the melanosome functions as a
resistance modulator regardless of patient genetic background and
that modulating biogenesis could potentially be effective adjuvant
therapy for many, if not all, melanoma patients.
In summary, we have shown that genes regulating melanosome
formation modulate cis-platin, vinblastine, and etoposide sensitivity. This suggests the possibility of targeting the pathway of
melanosome biogenesis for therapeutic purposes to modify tumor
drug resistance. These genes contribute functionally to the
multidrug resistance capacity of melanomas; thus, targeted
pharmacologic manipulation may serve to increase melanoma
sensitivity to a number of agents with differing modes of activity
and has the potential to significantly increase the efficacy of
existing melanoma treatments.

or localized increase in skin pigmentation (43), suggesting that upregulation of melanosomes or melanin may be a general stress/
toxin response. Thus, one mechanism whereby melanoma stem
cells could acquire resistance when exposed to chemotherapy
could be via the up-regulation of melanosome biogenesis.
Our findings reported here have potentially significant implications for clinical practice. One prediction is that clinically
amelanotic melanomas (melanomas lacking pigment), which likely
do not have fully mature melanosomes, might be more susceptible
to combination chemotherapy, which includes cis-platin, vinblastine, and/or etoposide, compared with melanotic melanomas.
Current clinical practice does not distinguish between melanotic
and amelanotic tumors, and both are assumed to be equally
resistant to therapy. Based on our in vitro findings, it is predicted
that some patients with amelanotic melanomas, an easily identified
subpopulation, could potentially be amenable to drug treatment
with readily available regimens. Current efforts are under way to
examine this issue and test the drug sensitivities of melanotic
versus amelanotic tumors.
It is interesting to note that the in vitro results indicate that
disruption of melanosome formation preserves the difference in
drug sensitivity between primary melanocytes and melanoma cells,
suggesting that the cDDP toxicity effects of disruptors will be more
profound in melanoma tumors versus primary melanocytes, an
important aspect for developing clinical applications. Also, whereas
it is crucial to do comparisons of congenic cells to unambiguously
assign gene influence, it is also important from a clinical
standpoint that our data from genetically disparate melanomas
