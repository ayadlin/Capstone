ABSTRACT
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic
malignancy with variable prognosis. It represents 15% of diagnosed pediatric ALL
cases and has a threefold higher incidence among males. Many recurrent alterations
have been identified and help define molecular subgroups of T-ALL, however the full
range of events involved in driving transformation remain to be defined. Using an
integrative approach combining genomic and transcriptomic data, we molecularly
characterized 30 pediatric T-ALLs and identified common recurrent T-ALL targets
such as FBXW7, JAK1, JAK3, PHF6, KDM6A and NOTCH1 as well as novel candidate
T-ALL driver mutations including the p.R35L missense mutation in splicesome
factor U2AF1 found in 3 patients and loss of function mutations in the X-linked
tumor suppressor genes MED12 (frameshit mutation p.V167fs, splice site mutation
g.chrX:70339329T>C, missense mutation p.R1989H) and USP9X (nonsense mutation
p.Q117*). In vitro functional studies further supported the putative role of these
novel T-ALL genes in driving transformation. U2AF1 p.R35L was shown to induce
aberrant splicing of downstream target genes, and shRNA knockdown of MED12
and USP9X was shown to confer resistance to apoptosis following T-ALL relevant
chemotherapy drug treatment in Jurkat leukemia cells. Interestingly, nearly 60%
of novel candidate driver events were identified among immature T-ALL cases,
highlighting the underlying genomic complexity of pediatric T-ALL, and the need for
larger integrative studies to decipher the mechanisms that contribute to its various
subtypes and provide opportunities to refine patient stratification and treatment.

INTRODUCTION

higher incidence is observed among males [4], however
the biological implications underlying this gender bias
remain poorly understood. Despite the introduction of
intensified chemotherapy protocols, very few inroads
into new therapeutic approaches for these high-risk
patients have been made. Recent studies [5–8] have
shown that further classification of T-ALL could reveal
new diagnostic markers and provide alternative targeted
treatment options.
Immunophenotypic and gene expression signature
analyses revealed a limited number of T-ALL subtypes
based largely on differential expression of surface antigen

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most
common childhood cancer, accounting for 25% of all
pediatric tumors [1]. Despite continued refinement of
childhood ALL subtype classification and improved
risk-based treatment strategies, survival rates remain
significantly lower among high-risk patients [2]. Pediatric
T-cell ALL (T-ALL) represents 10–15% of ALL cases
[3] with a quarter of the patients experiencing relapse,
and lower post-relapse survival compared to the more
common B-lineage ALL [1]. Interestingly, a threefold

markers and oncogene expression signatures related
to stage-specific T-cell developmental arrest [3, 9, 10].
Gene fusions involving the juxtaposition of transcription
factor proto-oncogenes under the control of T-cell specific
enhancers located in the TCRB (7q34) or TCRA-TCRD
(14q11) have been shown to be essential driver events
in T-ALL and further define molecular subtypes [9].
Additional recurrent, as well as cryptic chromosomal
rearrangement events that lead to T-cell specific protooncogene activation have also been described and
some have shown prognostic significance. For instance,
CALM-AF10 resulting from the t(10;11)(p13;q14-21)
translocation is one of the most frequent fusion events
found in 10% of childhood T-ALL cases and has been
associated with poor prognosis, particularly among
immature T-ALL patients [11, 12].
Recent studies have used comprehensive genomic
approaches to gain further insight into the mutational
landscape of T-ALL and have led to the identification of
novel disease mechanisms [6, 8] and recurrent somatic
alterations with pathogenic relevance. The most prevalent
are constitutive activation of NOTCH1 signaling,
observed in up to 60% of T-ALL patients [13], and loss
of the CDKN2A/p16INK4a (chromosome 9p21) locus
[14], occurring in up to 70% of cases. Loss of function
mutations in FBXW7 are also frequent in T-ALL (about
15% of cases) and contribute to sustained NOTCH1
activation by preventing its proteasomal degradation in
the nucleus [15]. Other frequently altered gene/pathway
categories in T-ALL include signal transduction (PTEN,
JAK1, JAK3, NF1, NRAS, IL7R and FLT3), transcription
factors (WT1, LEF1, ETV6, GATA3 and BCL11B) as
well as chromatin remodeling (EZH2, SUZ12, EED and
KDM6A/UTX) [15]. Such studies have also identified a
distinct, very aggressive T-ALL subtype defined by very
early arrest in T-cell development [16, 17, 5]. These early
T-cell precursor ALLs (ETP-ALLs) were genetically
characterized by activating mutations in genes regulating
cytokine and RAS signaling, inactivating mutations in
hematopoietic development genes and histone-modifying
genes [5].
These observations suggest that large, integrative
efforts will continue to yield further insight into childhood
T-ALL, particularly given that the pathogenesis of this
disease and of its various subtypes cannot be entirely
explained by the data currently available. In this study,
we used a combination of exome and transcriptome
sequencing, as well as high-density genotyping to
characterize 30 childhood T-ALLs. We identified
common recurrent mutations in known T-ALL genes (e.g.
NOTCH1, PHF6, FBXW7 and JAK3) as well as novel
somatic mutations in genes involved in RNA splicing
(U2AF1), chromatin remodeling (KMT2C/MLL3) and of
particular interest given the observed male gender bias, in
X-linked genes MED12 and USP9X. Additional functional
studies provide evidence of the potential implication of

these newly identified mutations in childhood T-ALL
pathogenesis. Overall, our findings indicate a need for
further large-scale genomic investigations to refine
patient stratification and optimize treatment strategies in
childhood T-ALL.

RESULTS
The genomic landscape of childhood T-ALL
Partially overlapping data from cytogenetic analysis,
whole exome and genome sequencing, ultra-deep targeted
re-sequencing, and RNA sequencing were available at
diagnosis for 30 childhood T-ALL patients (matched
normal-tumor) and at relapse for two of these patients
(Figure 1 and Table 1). Immunophenotyping and gene
expression data, when available, were used to classify
patients according to T-cell maturation status (Table 1,
Supplementary Figure S1, Supplementary Table S1, S2
Table and Supplementary Information). Seven patients
(324, 432, 706, 716, 748, 791 and 879) clustered as early
immature T-ALLs, among whom 2 patients (791 and
879) showed immunophenotype and expression markers
indicative of an early T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL)
phenotype [16]. Thirteen patients (340, 341, 437, 544,
547, 636, 647, 693, 727, 743, 744, 759 and 849) were
classified as mature T-ALLs and 10 patients could not be
classified due to insufficient data (Table 1).
We identified several structural chromosomal
abnormalities within our cohort (Figure 1 and
Supplemental Information). Mature T-ALL patients 547,
759 and 636 were shown to carry translocations t(1;14)
(p34;q11), t(11;14)(p13;q11) and t(10;14)(q24;q11)
respectively, leading to the juxtaposition of the TAL1,
LMO2 and TLX1/HOX11 oncogenes to the T-cell receptor
alpha/delta (TCRA/D) at locus 14q11 [18–20]. We also
identified a rarer translocation t(1;7)(p32;q34)/TRBTAL1 in the mature T-ALL patient 849 [9] as well as the
well-known t(10;11)(p12;q14) CALM-AF10 translocation
in both ETP-ALL cases 791 and 879 and a t(9;22)
(q34;q11.2)/BCR-ABL in the immature T-ALL patient
748 which is very rare in T-ALL (~1%) [21, 3]. Above
80% of the patients with available expression data showed
activation of at least one (proto-)oncogene such as TAL1,
TLX3, FLT3, LMO2, LYL1 and PIM1 with no evidence
of a related fusion event (Supplementary Figure S1A
and Supplementary Table S2). For example, LMO2 was
shown to be upregulated in the mature T-ALL patient 547
and four early immature T-ALL patients including both
ETP-ALLs (432, 748, 791 and 879), while none of these
patients were identified as carriers of a LMO2 activating
translocation. LYL1 was upregulated in all but one early
immature T-ALL patient (716) without an associated
translocation.
On average, we identified 29 somatic SNVs/
indels and 37 somatic CNVs per tumor (Figure 1 and

Supplementary Table S3). Based on strict filtering criteria
(Methods), we identified a total of 68 candidate driver
SNVs/indels (55 distinct mutations) across 28 genes
among the 30 pediatric T-ALL patients and all patients
harboured at least one candidate driver mutation (Figure 1
and Supplementary Table S3). RNA-seq data, when
available, confirmed expression of 84% of the mutated
alleles (21/25) (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure  S2).
‘’Hemopoiesis/T-cell differentiation’’ was the most
frequently altered pathway among the cohort with 80%
of patients carrying mutations in 9 genes affecting this
pathway. ‘’Post/Transcriptional regulation’’ (14 genes),
‘’Chromatin modification/assembly’’ (6 genes), ‘’Notch
signaling” (6 genes) and ‘’Regulation of cell cycle’’
(6 genes) were also found to be frequently altered.

34 of the reported candidate driver mutations were
previously reported (COSMIC 72) among which 29 in
hematopoietic malignancies (COSMIC v72) including
26 in known T-ALL driver genes such as FBXW7, JAK1,
JAK3, PHF6, KDM6A and NOTCH1. These variations
were mostly clonal (mean variant allele frequency-VAF
= 0.48, standard deviation-SD = 0.10), confirming their
presence in the majority of tumor cells at diagnosis and
their initiating role in T-ALL (Supplementary Figure S3
and Supplemental Information). Ras pathway mutations
had significantly lower frequencies compared to these
common drivers with a mean VAF = 0.33 (SD = 0.11)
(p  =  0.006, Mann-Whitney-U test) (Supplementary
Figure S3 and Supplementary Information). Subclonality
of these mutations corroborates previous reports [22–24]

The novel U2AF1 p.R35L mutation alters premRNA splicing in human T-cells

that describe a secondary role for Ras mutations in T-ALL
occurring later in tumor progression. Fifteen patients
(50%) harbored NOTCH1 mutations and two thirds (12/18)
of identified NOTCH1 mutations were located in exons
26 and 27, coding for the extracellular heterodimerization
domain and were mainly missense mutations (11/12).
The remaining 6 NOTCH1 mutations were located
in exon 34 coding for the C-terminal PEST (4/6) and
transactivation (2/6) domains and consisted mainly of
truncating mutations (5/6), as previously reported [25].
Recurrent events also involved the tumor suppressor
locus 9p21 with CDKN2A/2B (p16INK4a and p15INK4b)
deletions occurring in 17 (57%) of our childhood T-ALL
cases (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S3), of which 14
were biallelic. For 5/17 patients, the 9p21 deletion event
included the hematopoiesis regulator MLLT3 [26], 6/17
included the long non-coding RNA MIR31HG recently
shown to regulate CDKN2A expression [27], and 9/17
included the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase MTAP.
Although the associations require validations in larger
cohorts, patients mutated for CDKN2A had significantly
less chance of relapse (p = 0.0121, Fisher’s Exact test).
Interestingly, immature T-ALL patients (early immature
T-ALL and ETP-ALL together) had significantly less
CDKN2A alterations (p = 0.0044, Fisher’s Exact test) and
a higher risk of relapse (p = 0.0072, Fisher’s Exact test).
Twenty-one variations had not previously been
reported and thus were considered as novel T-ALL driver
mutations, including 3 in NOTCH1 (p.N1603K, p.P2475fs
and p.L2326fs) as well as novel predicted deleterious
mutations in the well-known X-linked PHF6 (p.E221* and
p.G226fs) and KDM6A/UTX (p.Q692*) [8, 28] (Figure 1
and Supplementary Table S3). Among these novel putative
childhood T-ALL drivers, we identified a number of
mutations in chromatin remodeling genes EHMT1 (n = 4),
WHSC1 (n = 3) and KMT2C/MLL3 (n = 1), a recurrent
missense mutation (p.R35L) in the first zinc finger of
splicing factor U2AF1 (n = 3), as well as loss of ABL1
(n = 2) and in MLH1 (n = 2), both involved in DNA repair.
Two patients had gain of copy of JAG2 which functions
in the Notch signaling pathway, and two novel missense
mutations (p.Q79K and p.R208K) were identified in the
oncogenic serine/threonine-protein kinase AKT2 involved
in cell cycle regulation. We also identified two novel
candidate driver genes on the X chromosome: a novel
nonsense mutation in the deubiquitinating protease USP9X
(p.Q117*) in male patient 194; and 3 novel mutations in
MED12, a member of the Mediator complex involved in
regulating RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription,
were found in male patient 744 (splice site mutation
g.chrX:70339329T>C) and female ETP-ALL patients
791 (missense mutation p.R1989H) and 879 (frameshift
insertion p.V167fs). Mutations in USP9X and MED12
presented VAFs (mean = 0.97, SD = 0.04) that were similar
to the known driver mutations in PHF6 and KDM6A/UTX
(mean = 0.97, SD = 0.05) (p = 1.0000) (Supplementary
Figure S3 and Supplementary Information).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The novel recurrent p.R35L missense mutation
was located in a zinc finger (ZnF) domain of the U2AF1
(U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1) gene, coding
for a member of the spliceosome machinery involved in
pre-mRNA processing (Figure 2A and Supplementary
Table S3). Three patients (200, 324 and 791) carried the
predicted damaging mutation; patient 200 was unclassified
and the other two were classified as early immature
T-ALLs (324 and the ETP-ALL 791) and experienced
relapse. An additional cohort consisting of 8 adult relapsed
T-ALL patients was used for further screening of newly
identified somatic driver candidates and revealed a clonal
p.R35L mutation (VAF = 0.53) in the relapse genome
of a 32 years old female case (patient P6, Methods and
Supplementary Table S4).
The previously identified U2AF1 p.S34F mutation
(Figure 2A), located in the same ZnF in myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) patients, was shown to disrupt splicing
of a number of cancer-relevant genes leading to overall
dysregulation of several downstream pathways including
epigenetic regulation and DNA damage response [29,
30–32]. To assess the putative impact of the novel p.R35L
mutant on alternative splice site utilization, we tested
for the presence of quantifiable isoforms among known
U2AF1 targets (BCOR, KMT2D/MLL2, KDM6A/UTX
and PICALM) [32] in human T lymphocyte (Jurkat) cells.
BCOR and KMT2D/MLL2 were the only target genes
with two identifiable isoforms (data not shown). Using
site-directed mutagenesis, we created mutant T-cell lines
overexpressing either WT or p.R35L mutated U2AF1
(Figure 2B) and showed alternative splice site usage at
both BCOR and KMT2D/MLL2 loci that were specific to
p.R35L (p = 0.0286 for both genes, Mann-Whitney U test)
(Figure 2C). These data suggest a comparable effect for
the p.R35L mutation leading to disrupted splicing and
further support a role for functional U2AF1 mutations in
abnormal hematopoiesis, including childhood T-ALL.

Novel X-linked drivers of T-ALL
In 8 T-ALL patients (74, 194, 544, 636, 727, 744,
791 and 879), we identified 4 known somatic mutations
(p.I314T, p.R116*, p.R225*, p.Y303*) and 2 novel
mutations (p.E221*, p.G226fs) in the well-known
X-linked driver gene PHF6 (Figure 3A). One mature
T-ALL (744) also carried a novel nonsense mutation in
KDM6A/UTX (p.Q692*) which was recently characterized
as a T-ALL X-linked driver gene [8, 28] (Figure 3B).
We observed no gender bias in the distribution of PHF6
mutations in our cohort (p = 1.0000) with 25% (5/20)
of male patients harboring mutations compared to 30%
(3/10) of females. This is in line with recent observations
[25, 33] that PHF6 alone is unlikely to account for the
higher incidence of T-ALL among males.

Our genomic investigation revealed 2 new
candidate X-linked drivers of T-ALL: USP9X and
MED12. For USP9X, we identified a novel truncating
mutation (p.Q117*) in exon 5 carried by the unclassified
male patient 194 suggesting a tumor suppressor role
(Figure 3C).
As for MED12, we identified 3 novel somatic
mutations (Figure 3D). One was located at the donor
splice site of exon 2 (g.chrX:70339329T>C) in mature
male patient 744 (Figure 4A). RNA-seq performed at
diagnosis, as well as RT-PCR assays, confirmed that the
mutated donor site was skipped leading to an aberrant
form of the mature MED12 mRNA where exon 2 was
lost (Figure 4B and 4C). This is the first MED12 mutation
shown to lead to exon skipping in cancer. Interestingly, we

also identified a missense mutation (p.R1989H) in exon
41 and a frameshift mutation (p.V167fs) in exon 14 of
MED12 in the two female ETP-ALL cases 791 and 879,
respectively. While, MED12 was previously shown to
be subject to X-inactivation, it has also been shown that
inactivation can be tissue-specific [34]. Through allelic
expression analysis, we showed biallelic expression of a
germline synonymous SNP (rs5030619) in the female case
879 (Supplementary Figure S4), suggesting that MED12
could indeed escape X-inactivation in T-ALL.
To further test the impact of the loss of function of
MED12 and USP9X in driving T-ALL development or
maintenance, we performed in vitro small hairpin RNA
(shRNA) assays in human T lymphocyte (Jurkat) cells
(Figure 3C and 3D) and assessed aberrant proliferation

and apoptosis resistance. While no significant changes in
proliferation were observed (Supplementary Figure S5),
knockdown of both genes led to a reproducible and
significant reduction of apoptosis following Camptothecin
(CPT) and at least one relevant chemotherapy drug
treatment, Doxorubicine (DOX) or Vincristine (VCR),
compared to control (Figure 3C and 3D and Supplementary

Although the observed effect might be context-dependent
or cell-type specific, these results provide evidence that
reduced activity of these new candidate X-linked driver
genes could perturb normal T-cell development, confer a
treatment resistance and point to a potential contribution
to the observed gender bias in T-ALL among males [4].

determined. We identified mutations (novel and known)
and analyzed expression profiles of common driver
genes, further highlighting the heterogeneity and distinct
characteristics of T-ALL. We identified recurrent mutations
in novel childhood T-ALL genes and functionally
characterized 3 new candidate driver genes (U2AF1,
MED12 and USP9X). Overall, mutation rates in this
childhood T-ALL cohort were similar to those previously
reported [14, 33, 35–39]. For example, 15 (50%) and
16 (53%) patients harboured NOTCH1 mutations and
CDKN2A/2B deletions, respectively. Immature T-ALL
patients harboured significantly less CDKN2A deletions
and experienced more relapse events compared to mature
T-ALL cases, as previously published [16]. Our data
also suggested a correlation between CDKN2A deletions
and positive outcome with only one CDKN2A-deleted
patient suffering a relapse event against 15 who did not,
suggesting potential clinical utility of CDKN2A for riskbased stratification of T-ALL patients.
Another recurrently mutated T-ALL gene in
our cohort was PHF6. Seven patients harbored PHF6
mutations with a higher mutational rate compared to
those previously reported for pediatric T-ALL (26.7% vs.
16–17.1%) [40, 33]. Interestingly, while previous analysis

DISCUSSION
In this study we performed comprehensive genomic
characterization of 30 pediatric T-cell ALL patients,
including 7 early immature T-ALLs (of which 2 were
ETP-ALLs), 13 mature T-ALLs, and 10 patients for
whom the maturation status of T-ALL cells could not be

mRNA lacking exon 2. (B) Synthetic electrophoresis gel of MED12 PCR products (Methods). cDNAs were synthesized from mature RNA

and two T-ALL patients, WT for this position (791 and 727). Amplified fragments of 281 bp (WT samples) and 176 bp (mutated sample)
were analyzed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The 105 bp difference corresponds to the skipped exon 2. L: ladder; CTL-: negative control.

showed higher prevalence among males (32.0% vs.
2.5% of females) [40], we found here a slightly higher
proportion of PHF6 mutated females (30.0% vs. 25% of
males). The E3-ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 had a mutation
frequency of 13.3% (n = 4) in our childhood T-ALL
cohort, similar to previous reports (8.6–19.1%) [33, 41,
42, 35–39]. We also observed recurrent mutations in the
JAK3 oncogene (13.3% vs. 5–15.3%), which is the most
frequently targeted gene of the JAK-STAT pathway in
T-ALL [5, 33]. Additional known T-ALL driver genes
also found to be mutated in our cohort include KDM6A/
UTX (3.4% vs. 4.5–14%) [33, 28], JAK1 (3.4% vs. 4.5%)
[33], PTPN2 (3.4% vs. 3.6%) [33] and LEF1 (6.9% vs.
7.2–17.0%) [33, 43]. T-ALL genes that were mutated less
frequently in our cohort, compared to previous studies,
include WT1 (6.7% vs. 13.2–16.2%) [44, 33], PTEN
(3.4% vs. 10–11.7%) [45, 46, 5, 33] and DNM2 (6.9%
vs. 10.8– 18.0%) [5, 33]. And despite previous reports of
childhood T-ALL [5, 8, 47] we found no mutation in the
polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), CNOT3, RPL10
and IL7R in our cohort.
T-ALL is characteristically more common among
males. Recent studies have characterized T-ALL drivers
in non-autosomal regions of chromosome X such as
PHF6, RPL10 and KDM6A/UTX [40, 8, 28]. However,
PHF6 and RPL10 are subject to X inactivation in females
[40, 8], and KDM6A/UTX has a relatively low frequency
(4.5 to 14%) in T-ALL [33, 28], therefore these genes
alone cannot explain the observed skewed male:female
ratio [48]. We identified additional novel X-linked
candidate driver mutations in USP9X and MED12 that
were shown to co-occur with PHF6 mutations in our
childhood T-ALL cohort. Both genes have previously
been implicated in diverse cancer types but have never
been associated with T-ALL. USP9X belongs to the Ubspecific protease family and targets multiple proteins
including SMURF1 [49], MCL1 [50] and Smad4 [51] and
has been shown to escape X-inactivation [52]. USP9X has
been demonstrated to positively regulate T-cell receptor
signaling and to be required for T-cell function [53]. The
oncogenic driving potential of USP9X was confirmed
in several tumor types: loss of function of the gene in
chronic myelogenous leukemia [54], hepatocellular
[55] or colorectal carcinoma [56], bladder cancer [57]
and B-cell ALL [58] leads to increased sensitivity to
chemotherapy and to apoptosis. On the other hand,
tumor suppressor functions have also been described
in pancreatic adenocarcinoma [59, 60] and gingivobuccal oral squamous cell carcinoma [61], highlighting
the context-dependent role of USP9X in oncogenesis.
The p.Q117* truncating mutation identified here in a
single male patient (194) suggests a tumor suppressor
role for USP9X in T-ALL, and the strong decrease in
apoptosis observed following knockdown of the gene and
chemotherapy drug treatment further corroborates the
anti-oncogenic role of USP9X in childhood T-ALL and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggests a possible involvement on treatment resistance.
As for MED12, it was altered in 10% of our T-ALL
patients and was as frequently mutated as the known
T-ALL gene NRAS. The loss-of-function mutations in
MED12 (p.V167fs and splice site g.chrX:70339329T>C)
were both shown to be expressed, supporting a functional
role of these mutations in T-ALL. Somatic mutations in
MED12 exon 2 splice sites have previously been identified
in breast cancer and were shown to cause intron retention
[62]. MED12, along with MED13, Cyclin C, and CDK8
or CDK19, is a member of the kinase module of Mediator,
a multisubunit complex required for regulation of RNA
polymerase II-dependent transcription [63]. In line with
our observations, MED12 was recently characterized as a
tumor suppressor in uterine leiomyomas, prostate cancer,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia and breast fibroadenoma
[64–68]. Mutations in exon 2 showed a particularly high
rate of somatic alterations (70% of uterine leiomyomas)
[64] and have been shown to disrupt the direct interaction
of MED12 with the cyclin C-CDK8 leading to reduced
Mediator activity [66]. Here, MED12 appears to escape
X-inactivation. In addition we showed that loss of MED12
in human T-cells leads to decreased apoptosis levels
provoked by chemotherapy drugs, further corroborating
its role as tumor suppressor in childhood T-ALL and
highlighting its putative relapse driving potential in
leukemogenesis. This is in line with recent results showing
that MED12 repression induces resistance to multiple
cancer drugs through TGF-βR signaling regulation [69].
USP9X and MED12 mutations were detected in
the predominant clone at diagnosis and the two patients
for whom we had relapse sequencing data available
showed the presence of mutations in the major clone at
relapse. These results indicate an early clonal selection
supporting a possible functional role in early phases
of T-ALL development and a possible implication in
relapse. While further investigations are required to
fully decipher the mechanisms underlying the observed
USP9X and MED12 induced anti-apoptotic effects, the
identification of two novel X-linked tumor suppressor
genes in pediatric T-ALL and their co-occurrence with
known X-linked driver gene mutations (PHF6) suggests
cooperating effects of X-linked mutations in T-ALL onset.
The presence of several T-ALL tumor suppressor genes on
the X chromosome, most of which escape X-inactivation,
substantially increases the odds for males to develop the
disease and could therefore explain the higher incidence of
T-ALL among male children, provided that mutated forms
of these proteins do not create dominant effects. However
the underlying disease mechanisms associated with these
alleles remains to be determined.
We also identified a novel recurrent T-ALL mutation
(p.R35L) in U2AF1 in 3 patients, including 2 immature
cases. And through screening of additional adult relapsed
T-ALL patients we confirmed recurrence of this novel
mutation even in adults. U2AF1 is a common mutational

UTX. EHMT1 codes for a H3K9 methyltransferase and
is a member of the E2F6 repressor complex. To the best
of our knowledge this gene has never been associated
with T-ALL, although previous reports demonstrated
overexpression of EHMT1 associated with poor prognosis
in esophageal cancer and treatment resistance in chronic
myeloid leukemia [83, 84]. We did not identify loss-offunction mutations in known T-ALL genes EZH2, SUZ12
or EED, but we identified activating somatic events
in the H3K27 methyltransferase WHSC1 (MMSET,
NSD2). WHSC1 is a well-known and recurrent target
for mutation in pediatric B-ALL as well as adult T-ALL
[85, 86], however somatic disruption of WHSC1 in
pediatric T-ALL is less frequent [86]. WHSC1 was
mutated at higher frequency in our cohort, compared to
previous reports in adult T-ALL (10.3% vs 4.9%) [86].
The gain of copy identified in the ETP-ALL case 791 as
well as the recurrent p.E1099K mutation found in the
mature case 340 lead to enhanced activation of WHSC1
which correlates with increased H3K36 and decreased
H3K27 methylation and an open chromatin state across
the genome. Activating WHSC1 mutations mimic the
described PCR2 loss-of-function mutations in ALL and
could alter normal lymphoid differentiation and cell
survival and support an oncogenic role for WHSC1 in
childhood T-ALL [87]. However the p.S231* loss of
function mutation identified in the early immature patient
432 is difficult to interpret. Haploinsufficiency of WHSC1
accounts for the core phenotypes of Wolf-Hirschhorn
syndrome including facial appearance, mental retardation,
growth delay and seizures [88]. This stop codon mutation
could simply be a passenger event in 432 or provide a
specific advantage given this patient’s genetic background.
The KMT2C/MLL3 frameshift mutation (p.Y816fs) in
patient 791 had never been identified in hematological
malignancies before. KMT2C/MLL3 haploinsufficiency
was shown to impair differentiation of hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells and to provoke resistance to
conventional chemotherapy [89]. This resistance might
explain the emergence of subclonal KMT2C/MLL3
p.Y816fs positive cells in patient 791 at relapse. Finally,
as recently reported in T-ALL [33], we identified the loss
of a complete copy of the transcriptional repressor CTCF
in one ETP-ALL patient, as well as the histone and nonhistone acetyltransferase CREBBP in one mature case
(636). CTCF was recently demonstrated to be a tumor
suppressor [90] and its haploinsufficiency to lead to an
increased variability in CpG methylation genome-wide.
Tumors with hemizygous loss of CTCF showed increased
aggressiveness, as observed here for ETP-ALL patient
791. The tumor suppressor gene CREBBP is a frequent
mutational target in hematological malignancies and
mutations in this gene are associated with increased risk
of relapse in ALL [91], though patient 636 did not suffer
relapse. Overall, these results support an important role for
chromatin modification in T-ALL [92, 93, 5].

target in several cancer types, such as MDS where 11%
of cases are mutated [70, 71]. The importance of the
spliceosome machinery in leukemogenesis has been
demonstrated [70, 72] and mutations in U2AF1 were
recently shown to predict poor prognosis in patients with
de novo acute myeloid leukemia [73]. The identified
p.R35L mutation was previously reported in 2 cases
of myeloid neoplasms [74, 29], but to the best of our
knowledge, U2AF1 has never been associated with
T-ALL prior to this study. U2AF1 has a U2AF homology
motif allowing the heterodimerization with U2AF2
[75], an arginine-serine (RS) domain required for RNA
high-affinity binding [76], and two ZnF domains. The
p.R35L mutation identified here, as well as recurrent
MDS mutations at residues S34 and Q157, fall within
the ZnF domains. Although the role of these domains
remains elusive, our functional studies support a function
in the splicing mechanism with the p.R35L mutation
leading to alternative splice site usage in known target
genes such as the transcriptional corepressor BCOR,
associated with poor prognosis in MDS when altered
[77], or the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2D/MLL2
that have been show to play a role in hematopoiesis [78].
KMT2C/MLL3 and KMT2D/MLL2 methyltransferases
along with the histone demethylase KDM6A/UTX are
members of the activating MLL2-KDM6A/UTX complex
[79], their deregulation due to cooperating mutations or
aberrant splicing events, could provide an alternative
mechanism to recurrent alterations of PRC2 members
EZH2, SUZ12 or EED in T-ALL. Mutations in U2AF1
typically occur early in the founding clone and are present
in the major clone at diagnosis [80–82], however p.R35L
was subclonal in our 3 patients. This U2AF1 mutation
would appear therefore to be a late, secondary event in
the developmental history of these T-ALL cases. The fact
that this mutation is subclonal could explain its absence
in other T-ALL studies, particularly in the event of low
tumor purity or extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity. It
should be noted that in ETP-ALL patient 791, p.R35L
was present in a very minor subclone (VAF = 0.09) and
was lost at relapse, which in this case, could render its
functional role questinable. However, in addition to
U2AF1 p.R35L, patient 791 also harbored a frameshift
insertion p.Y816fs in the methyltransferase KMT2C/
MLL3, that was carried by another subclone at diagnosis
(VAF = 0.28) and presented a positive shift of frequency at
relapse (VAF = 0.39). KMT2C/MLL3 and KMT2D/MLL2
methyltransferases, along with the histone demethylase
KDM6A/UTX, are members of the activating MLL2KDM6A/UTX complex involved in promoting chromatin
remodeling [79]; cooperating mutations and aberrant
splicing events leading to altered histone modification
could contribute to disease pathogenesis.
Additional epigenetic regulators that were mutated
in this childhood T-ALL cohort include: EHMT1,
WHSC1, KTM2C/MLL3, CTCF, CREBBP and KDM6A/

In conclusion, through integrated whole-exome,
transcriptome, as well as targeted re-sequencing and
genotyping investigation of 30 childhood T-ALL patients,
we showed that each patient carried a unique combination
of known and novel somatic alterations, including SNVs,
indels, CNVs, and chromosomal rearrangements. We
observed a number of uncommon and novel mutations
in the early immature cases of our cohort, particularly in
the two ETP-ALL patients who harbored 80% of newlyidentified candidate driver mutations. We characterized
a recurrent mutation in the spliceosome member U2AF1
and demonstrated its impact on alternative splicing of
cancer-relevant genes, further suggesting the importance
of aberrant splicing in leukemogenesis. We also identified
MED12 and USP9X as putative new X-linked drivers
and provided evidence of the functional impact of their
loss in T-cells supporting a potential role for these genes
in the male-biased sex ratio observed in T-ALL. These
results further highlight the underlying complexity of
the genomic landscape of T-ALL, and the pressing need
of larger integrative studies in well-defined cohorts to
increase understanding of the biological mechanisms that
contribute to T-ALL and its various subtypes.

50 × 35 bp, mean coverage on targeted region = 35X) and
for cases 791 and 879 (paired-end: 100 × 100 bp, mean
coverage on targeted region = 120X). Reads obtained
from SOLiD 4/5500 and HiSeq 2500 systems were
aligned to the Hg19 reference genome using LifeScope
Genomic Analysis Software and Bowtie2 (version 2.2.3)
[96] respectively. PCR duplicates were removed using
Picard [97]. Genotype quality score recalibration was
performed using the Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK)
[98]. Sequencing metrics were obtained using the
DepthOfCoverage option in GATK. After filtering out low
quality reads, pileup files were created using SAMtools
[99]. Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and
small indels were called from pileup files using SNooPer,
a highly versatile machine learning approach that uses
Random Forest classification models and integrates
matched normal-tumor data to accurately call somatic
variants in low-depth sequencing data (Spinella et al. in
revision, software available upon request).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ultra-deep targeted re-sequencing was performed on
all candidate somatic driver mutations using the Illumina
TruSeq Custom Amplicon assay as per the manufacturer’s
instructions (Figure 1). Illumina DesignStudio was used
to design custom oligos targeting the select mutated
regions (available upon request). Genomic DNA from
bone marrow at diagnosis and from blood at remission
was used to validate somatic hits identified from WES
(24 cases) or to screen identified variant positions in 3
additional cases with insufficient DNA for WES. PCR
purification was performed with Ampure Beads for 150bp
amplicon size selection. Double stranded amplicons
were pooled, quantified by qPCR and sequenced on the
Illumina HiSeq2500 device (paired-end: 2 × 100 bp) to
reach a mean coverage of 2,500X. Reads were aligned to
the Hg19 reference genome using Bowtie2 (version 2.2.3)
[96]. Cleaned BAM files were used to create pileup files
using SAMtools [99]. A modified version of SNooPer was
used to screen mutations at the targeted positions directly
in the pileup file, and to compare normal and tumoral
information to confirm the somatic origin of the validated
mutations (details available upon request).
Because NOTCH1 mutations were difficult to
identify in the exome sequencing data due to insufficient
local coverage, Sanger sequencing was performed
targeting recurrently mutated regions of NOTCH1 in
T-ALL [13]. These included the N terminal region of
the heterodimerization (HD) domain on exon 26; the
C terminal region of the HD domain on exon 27; the
proline, glutamic acid, serine, threonine-rich (PEST)
domain; and the C terminal region of the transcriptional
activation domain (TAD) on exon 34. Primers used are

Study subjects
All study subjects were French-Canadians of
European descent. Incident cases were diagnosed in
the Division of Hematology-Oncology at the SainteJustine Hospital (Montreal, Canada) as part of the
Quebec childhood ALL cohort (QcALL) [94]. This
childhood T-ALL cohort (n = 30) consisted of 20
males and 10 females, with a mean age at diagnosis of
11.8 years. All were classified as high-risk patients and
treated accordingly under FRALLE and DFCI protocols
depending on year of diagnosis (Table 1). Eight patients
experienced relapse after a median time of 21 months
post-induction, of which five patients did not survive postrelapse, and one case (759) was refractory to induction
chemotherapy and died of cerebral hemorrhage at
6 months after diagnosis.

Whole-exome sequencing and variant
identification
Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on
24 matched normal-tumor T-ALL patients (Figure 1). DNA
was extracted from bone marrow samples (at diagnosis)
and peripheral blood samples (after remission) (Table 1)
using standard protocols [95]. Whole exomes were
captured in solution with Agilent’s SureSelect Human
All Exon (38 Mb or 50 Mb), Nextera Rapid Capture
Exome Enrichment kit (case 791) or SureSelectXT
Clinical Research Exome (case 879) kits according

analysed using the Sequencher software (Gene Codes)
(Supplementary Figure S7).
An additional cohort consisting of 8 adult relapsed
T-ALL patients from the Princess Margaret Cancer
Centre, University Health Network (Toronto, Canada)
(Supplementary Table S4) was used for further screening
of newly identified somatic driver candidates in USP9X,
MED12 and U2AF1. Ultra-deep targeted sequencing was
performed on the 5 somatic mutations identified in these 3
genes on Illumina MiSeq system (McGill University and
Génome Québec Innovation Centre); primers used are
available upon request. The analysis of sequencing data
was performed as described above.

a minimum mapping quality (q) set to 30 was used to
confirm rearrangements identified by cytogenetics or to
call new events from RNA-seq data.

Whole genome high-density SNV genotyping and
copy number variant identification
Whole genome genotyping (WGG) data were
available for 23 T-ALL patients (Figure 1). Normal and
tumor samples from these patients were genotyped using
Illumina’s HumanOmni 2.5-Quad or HumanOmni2.5Octo SNP bead arrays (McGill University and Genome
Quebec Innovation Centre, Montreal, Quebec). Extracted
genomic DNA was processed according to the Illumina
Infinium HD Assay Ultra protocol. BeadChips were
imaged on Illumina’s iScan System with iScan Control
Software (v3.2.45). The Genotyping Module (Version
1.9.4) of the Illumina GenomeStudio software (V2011.1)
was used for raw data normalization, genotype clustering
and calling, with default. ASCAT version 2.2 [103] was
used to evaluate the sample purity, to evaluate tumor
ploidy and to identify tumor-specific copy number variants
(CNVs) or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH).
CDKN2A gene allelic status was further evaluated
in all T-ALL patients at diagnosis using PCR. Each 25 µl
reaction contained 50 ng of template DNA, 1X KOD
Buffer, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 200 µM dNTPs, 0.3 µM of each
primer (listed in Supplementary Table S5) and 0.5U of
KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Millipore). Cycling
parameters used were: 95°C 2 min; 40 cycles (95°C
20 sec, 58°C 10 sec, 70°C 10 sec). Amplified fragments of
368 bp were visualized using standard gel electrophoresis.
Electrophoresis gels are available upon request.

RNA-sequencing and variant identification
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on 11
T-ALL patients (Figure 1) with suitable RNA quantity
and quality. Total RNA was extracted from bone marrow
samples at diagnosis for patients 432, 437, 547, 693, 716,
743, 744, 748, 791 and 849 using the mirVana Isolation
kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The Allprep DNA/RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) was used
for relapse samples in patients 791 and 879. For patient
744, mature RNA was also purified using the Ambion’s
MicroPoly(A)Purist kit (Small Scale mRNA Purification
Kit P/N AM1919). Following a DNAse I treatment, total
or mature RNA samples were quantified by NanoDrop
ND1000 (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) and RNA quality was
assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent).
Ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) were depleted
using the Invitrogen RiboMinus Eukaryote kit (Life
Technologies). cDNA libraries were prepared using the
SOLiD Total RNA-seq kit (diagnosis samples) and the
Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit (relapse samples)
based on manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced on the
Life Technologies SOLiD 4/5500 System (paired-end:
50 × 35 bp) or the Illumina HiSeq 2500 System (pairedend: 100 × 100 bp). Reads obtained from SOLiD 4/5500
and HiSeq 2500 systems were aligned to the Hg19
reference genome using LifeScope Genomic Analysis
Software (Whole Transcriptome Analysis pipeline,
default parameters) and STAR aligner (version 2.5) [100]
respectively. Remaining ribosomal sequences were filtered
out. Recalibration of the genotype quality scores was
performed using the Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK)
[98]. Cleaned BAM files were used to create pileup files
using SAMtools [99]. SNVs and small indels identified
from WES were screened in RNA-seq pileup files using
a modified version of SNooPer. Reads Per Kilobase
per Million mapped reads (RPKM) were calculated for
22,292 genes using the R bioconductor package edgeR
[101]. Heatmaps were constructed using the heatmap.2
library of the gplots R package using RPKM values of
genes of interest. Breakdancer (version 1.1.2) [102] with

Variant annotation and prioritization of cancer
driver gene mutations
ANNOVAR (version 2015Jun17) [104] and
Oncotator (version 1.8) [105] were used to annotate
somatic splice site variants, non-synonymous SNVs and
frameshift small indels. Variants were queried against
publically available datasets such as 1000 Genomes
[106], NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP)
[107] and Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)
[108] to filter out common polymorphisms (minor allele
frequency > 0.01). The Catalogue of Somatic Mutations
in Cancer (COSMIC, version 72) [109] was used to
evaluate prior implications in cancer. We classified each
mutated gene as either tumor suppressor genes (TSGs)
or oncogenes based on Vogelstein’s 20/20 rule [110]
on COSMIC v72 data (Supplementary Table S3). The
predicted functional impact of non-synonymous variants
and small indels was assessed using Sift (version 1.03)
[111], Polyphen2 (version 2.2.2) [112], MutationTaster 2
[113] and the Cancer-specific High-throughput Annotation
of Somatic Mutations tool (CHASM version 3.0) [114]

ShRNA-mediated gene knockdown

(Supplementary Table S3). Variants presenting a
score ≤ 0.05 were considered as damaging by Sift (D).
Mutations with a Polyphen2 score between 0.447 and
0.909 were predicted as possibly damaging (P) while a
score > 0.909 was considered as damaging. Mutations
with a MutationTaster score > 0.9 were also considered
as damaging. Finally, for CHASM classification we used
the Blood-Lymphocyte training set and a Benjamini and
Hochberg’s adjusted false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.20,
to prioritize mutations based on their predicted driver
potential. To identify candidate driver mutations we
filtered events and kept only somatic alterations that were:
i) missense mutations predicted to be driver by CHASM
[114]; or to be damaging by at least two of the other
three prediction algorithms; or identified as recurrent in
COSMIC v72 [109]; ii) splice site and nonsense mutations
that were predicted to be damaging by MutationTaster and
Sift, respectively; or located in a tumor suppressor gene;
or identified as recurrent in COSMIC; iii) frameshift indels
and deletions located in a TSG and gain of copies located
in an oncogene; iv) genes with more than one mutation
(SNV, indel or CNV) in our cohort but previously never
associated with pediatric T-ALL were considered as new
candidate driver genes. Based on these filtering criteria, we
identified somatic gene mutations with putative functional
effects in driving T-ALL development, some of which we
further investigated (USP9X, MED12 and U2AF1).

Lentivirus-mediated gene-specific small hairpin RNAs
(shRNAs) were used to knockdown expression of 2 candidate
driver genes: USP9X, and MED12, in Jurkat (human T
leukemia) cells. The complete list of MISSION® shRNAs
(Sigma-Aldrich) used to silence target gene expression are
listed in Supplementary Table S6 (at least 3 for each gene).
shRNA target sequences were subcloned into either the
lentiviral vector pLKO.1-puro (TRC1 version) or pLKO.5puro (TRC2 version). Briefly, using Polyethylenimine
(PEI; Polysciences), plasmids and packaging vectors (6 µg
of pRSV-Rev, 7.8 µg of plasmid pMD2.VSVG, 15 µg of
pMDL, and 9 µg of shRNA in pLKO-puro plasmid) were
co-transfected into HEK293T cells to generate respective
lentivirus. Supernatants containing lentiviruses were
harvested 48 h post-transfection. 1x10E6 Jurkat cells were
infected with 1 ml of supernatant in the presence of 5 μg/
mL of polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). 72 hours post-infection,
cells were screened with 2 µg/µl puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich)
for two weeks to select for shRNA-knockdown cells. Three
biologically independent replicates were carried out for each
target gene. The expression of target genes was measured by
quantitative PCR (qPCR).
Total RNA was extracted from infected cells using
RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 500 ng of total RNA were
reverse transcribed using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and qPCR amplifications
(triplicates) were performed on the ABI PRISM 7000
Sequence Detection System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in
a total volume of 25 µl as follows: 5 µl of cDNA (diluted
1:5), 0.2 µM of each primers (listed in Supplementary
Table S5), and 1X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The cycling parameters were: 95°C
10 min; 40 cycles [95°C 15 sec, 62°C 1 min], followed
by a denaturation curve at 60°C. GAPDH was used as
reference gene. Expression values were calculated by the
2−(ΔΔCt) formula previously described [115].

Cell lines
Human acute T-cell leukemia-derived Jurkat TetOn cells (630915, Clontech) and REH human leukemia
cells (#CRL-8286, A.T.C.C.) were grown in RPMI-1640
medium (Wisent) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin
(Wisent). The highly transfectable HEK293T cells
were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent).
Cells were routinely maintained at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere composed of 95% air and 5% CO2 and
provided with fresh medium every 2 to 3 days.

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was measured using the Alexa Fluor®
488 Annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, cells were seeded at 5x10E5 cells/mL in their
culture medium and treated with 2 μM of Camptothecin
for 17 hours or 500 nM of Doxorubicine for 18 hours
or 50 nM of Vincristine for 24 hours, to promote DNA
damage-induced apoptosis. Following incubation with
Annexin V Alexa Fluor® and propidium iodide (PI) at room
temperature for 30 min, stained cells were immediately
analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of apoptotic
cells was measured on the FACS Fortessa using the BD
FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) according to
manufacturer’s guidelines. At least three independent
experiments were carried out for each biological replicate.

RT-PCR validation of alternative splicing in
MED12
Total RNA was extracted (as above) from the patient’s
bone marrow at diagnosis, as well as from REH (human B
leukemia) cells, mature T cells (CD3+/CD19-) isolated from
cord blood samples, and from two g.chrX:70339329TT wild
type (WT) patients (727 and 791), used as controls. RNA
was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Ovation® qPCR
System (NuGEN Technologies). PCR were performed using
KOD Polymerase as described above. Amplified fragments
were analyzed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument
and by Sanger sequencing (McGill University and Genome
Quebec Innovation Centre).

U2AF1 p.R35L splicing assay

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The pOTB7 plasmid containing U2AF1 cDNA
was purchased from Harvard PlasmID Repository (clone
# HsCD00321863) and subcloned into the Gateway
compatible vector pDONR221. The R35L mutation was
introduced into the cDNA sequence of U2AF1 using
the QuickChange II XL Site Directed Mutagenesis kit
(Agilent) with primers listed in Supplementary Table S5.
Sanger sequencing (McGill University and Genome
Quebec Innovation Centre) was performed to confirm
the presence of the mutation. WT or R35L U2AF1
coding sequences were then subcloned into the Gateway
lentiviral vector pLenti CMV Puro DEST (w118–1) using
LR clonase Enzyme mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Lentiviruses were generated and Jurkat cells infected
(two biologically independent replicates) as described
above. Total RNA was extracted from infected cells
using RNeasy Mini Kit and treated with RNase-Free
DNase Set (Qiagen), and cDNAs were generated using
M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Overexpression of WT or R35L U2AF1 in Jurkat cells
was measured by qPCR amplification as described above.
To validate alternative splice site utilization at the BCOR
and KMT2D/MLL2 target genes, as described elsewhere
[32], RT-PCR was performed on cDNAs in duplicates
using KOD Hot Start Polymerase as described previously
with primers listed in Supplementary Table S5. PCR
products were electrophoresed in agarose gel stained with
SYBR Safe (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quantified by
densitometry using Image J software (version 1.49).
