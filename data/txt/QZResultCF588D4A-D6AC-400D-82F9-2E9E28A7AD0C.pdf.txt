ABSTRACT
CD147, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, is highly expressed in various cancer
types and plays important roles in tumor progression, especially by promoting the
motility and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. These crucial roles make
CD147 an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in HCC, but no small-molecule
inhibitors of CD147 have been developed to date. To identify a candidate inhibitor, we
used a pharmacophore model derived from the structure of CD147 to virtually screen over
300,000 compounds. The 100 highest-ranked compounds were subjected to biological
assays, and the most potent one, dubbed AC-73 (ID number: AN-465/42834501), was
studied further. We confirmed that AC-73 targeted CD147 and further demonstrated it can
specifically disrupt CD147 dimerization. Moreover, molecular docking and mutagenesis
experiments showed that the possible binding sites of AC-73 on CD147 included Glu64
and Glu73 in the N-terminal IgC2 domain, which two residues are located in the dimer
interface of CD147. Functional assays revealed that AC-73 inhibited the motility and
invasion of typical HCC cells, but not HCC cells that lacked the CD147 gene, demonstrating
on-target action. Further, AC-73 reduced HCC metastasis by suppressing matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 via down-regulation of the CD147/ERK1/2/signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Finally, AC-73 attenuated
progression in an orthotopic nude mouse model of liver metastasis, suggesting that
AC-73 or its derivatives have potential for use in HCC intervention. We conclude that
the novel small-molecule inhibitor AC-73 inhibits HCC mobility and invasion, probably
by disrupting CD147 dimerization and thereby mainly suppressing the CD147/ERK1/2/
STAT3/MMP-2 pathways, which are crucial for cancer progression.

declining for most cancers, rates are increasing for HCC
[2]. Despite significant improvement in both diagnostic and
therapeutic modalities for cancer patients, metastasis still
represents the major cause of cancer mortality [3]. It is well
known that metastasis involves a series of interrelated events,

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common cancers and is the frequent cause of cancer-related
death in the world [1]. Although incidence rates have been

including loss of the ability of cancer cells to adhere to their
native tissue, invasion into the surrounding extracellular
matrix, migration, and proliferation at a secondary site [4].
Nevertheless, despite the progress made in elucidating the
molecular events underlying metastasis [5,6], relapse rates
remain high after HCC resection, and relapse nearly always
originates from metastases [7]. Our inability to combat HCC
invasion and metastasis has become a major obstacle to the
survival and the quality of life in HCC patients [8].
In recent years, CD147 (also called EMMPRIN), a
member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has emerged
as a tumor-specific molecule. This molecule has been
implicated in many aspects of tumor progression, and
especially HCC metastasis [9]. In our previous studies it
was shown that CD147 might promote HCC metastasis
in multiple ways: by inducing matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs); by disrupting the HCC microenvironment [10];
by enhancing expression of βig-h3 [11]; and by regulating
downstream metastasis-related genes, such as FAK, Girdin,
Src and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3) [12,13]. To explore the basis of CD147 action on
the atomic level, the crystal structure of its extracellular
portion has been determined. The unique domain
organization, overall flexibility, and diverse dimerization
forms of CD147 provide structural clues about the multiple
homophilic interaction-dependent functions of this
molecule [14]. Furthermore, evidence strongly suggests that
CD147 promotes tumor invasion by forming dimerization.
Disruption of CD147 dimerization can prevent cancer
metastasis effectively through attenuating MAPK
activation and MMP-2 induction [15]. All of these results
make CD147 an attractive drug target for preventing HCC
metastasis. Indeed, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug
targeting CD147, termed Licartin, has been proven to be a
safe and beneficial treatment for HCC [16]. Nevertheless,
advances in drug design and chemical synthesis have made
small synthetic compounds more popular in drug screening
and clinical trials [17]. Furthermore, the detailed structural
information available for CD147 has allowed computational
drug screening. However, to date, no small-molecule drug
targeting CD147 for cancer therapy has been described.
In this study, we used an in silico screen to identify
a novel small molecule, dubbed AC-73 (China Patent
CN201310574056), as the first specific inhibitor of
CD147. To validate this inhibitor’s biological activities,
we evaluated its effects on HCC motility, invasion
and metastasis and explored the underlying molecular
mechanisms. Additionally, we assessed its potential for
use in HCC intervention using an in vivo assay.

pockets in dimerization interface are deeply enough to
bind small molecules and CD147 dimerization plays an
essential role in tumor progression, as mentioned earlier,
we chose the dimerization interface of CD147 to construct
a pharmacophore model. The search area for screening
was restricted to the C2 domain of the CD147 monomer
(Figure 1A). Over 300,000 compounds from the Specs
database were screened in silico. A total of 100 compounds
were selected for biological testing after several rounds of
screening (Figure 1B). Using SPR assay, the binding of
100 selected compounds to CD147 was evaluated through
value of Response Units (RU) and top five compounds
(RU > 20) were obtained (Figure 1C). Meanwhile, using
gelatin zymography experiments, the effect of compounds
on suppressing MMP-2 secretion was examined and 7
candidate compounds (inhibition ratio of > 30%) were
obtained (Figure 1D). Notably, we got one compound
dubbed AC-73 (Figure 1E), that presented both high RU
and high effect to suppress MMP-2 secretion (Table 1).

AC-73 inhibits CD147 dimerization
Next, we verified whether AC-73 could directly
disrupt CD147 dimerization. In a prokaryotic expression
system, wild-type CD147 (CD147wt) was easily purified,
and 5 μg of CD147wt was added to various concentrations
of AC-73. The mixture was then pretreated with nondenaturing loading buffer and immunoblotted with antiHis6 antibody. It was observed that two major bands for
CD147wt, appearing at 21 and 42 kDa, which represented
the monomer and dimer of CD147 extracellular domain
(CD147ECD), respectively, in solution (Figure 2A). We
noticed that comparing DMSO, AC-73 could directly
disrupt CD147 dimerization in a dose-dependent manner at
hundreds nanomolar level (Figure 2B). To further investigate
the inhibition of CD147 dimerization by AC-73 in cellulo,
a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay was performed.
HEK293T cells co-expressing CD147-HA and CD147-GFP
were treated with the indicated concentrations of AC-73
for 6 hrs. Protein lysates were then purified using anti-HA
magnetic beads and analyzed by Western blotting with antiFlag and anti-GFP antibodies (Figure 2C). Strikingly, the
level of CD147-GFP in the anti-Flag immunoprecipitates
decreased as the concentration of AC-73 increased at the
micromolar level (Figure 2D). Taken together, our results
suggested AC-73 can directly inhibit CD147 dimerization
both in prokaryotic expression system and in living cells.

AC-73 decreases the motility and invasion of
HCC cells by targeting CD147

RESULTS

To confirm whether AC-73 could reduce the
metastasis of HCC cells, we first evaluated the effect of AC73 on the motility of HCC cells using an in vitro scratch
assay. Treatment with AC-73 significantly decreased the
migration ability of SMMC-7721 cells in a dose-dependent

manner. Given that no other small molecules is known to
target CD147, we used the mAb HAb18, a specific antibody
against CD147 that has been described as a suppressor
of the mobility of HCC, as a positive control [10].
Results showed that 10 μM AC-73 significantly inhibited
approximately 50% of the migration efficacy compared
with DMSO. Similar results were also obtained in Huh-7
cells (Figure 3A and 3B). Furthermore, AC-73 impaired the
invasive ability of HCC cells, as assessed by a transwell
assay. In Figure 3C, AC-73 decreased the invasion of two
HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner at 24 hrs. In Figure
3D, IC50 was calculated as 10.19 μM for SMMC-7721 and
7.16 μM for Huh-7, respectively. Notably, using WST-1
assay, we also found there were no obvious effects on cell
viability when two HCC cells were treated with AC-73 at
a maximum concentration of 20 μM. These results implied
that the inhibition of HCC cells migration and invasion by
AC-73 was not due to cytotoxicity (Figure 3E).
To determine whether AC-73 affected the mobility
and invasion of HCC cells by targeting CD147, we
compared the responses of AC-73 in the two HCC cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lines with those in two derivative cell lines in which the
CD147 gene was disrupted (Supplementary Figure S1AS1D). All four cell lines were treated with AC-73 or
DMSO for 24 hrs. Importantly, AC-73 reduced mobility
in the parental HCC cell lines, but not in the CD147deficient cells, indicating that AC-73 acted by targeting
CD147 (Figure 3F). Similarly, using the transwell assay,
both parental HCC cell lines showed strikingly higher
sensitivity to AC-73 compared with their CD147-deficient
derivatives. More specifically, 10 μM AC-73 decreased the
invasive ability of SMMC-7721 and Huh-7 cells by nearly
50% but barely reduced the invasion rate in their knockout
(KO) counterparts (Figure 3G).
To confirm the specific targeting, we constructed
a stable cell line that harbored CD147 gene and no
endogenous CD147 expressing by transfecting the
plasmid pcDNA3.1-CD147 into 7721 CD147-/-, forming
cells termed SMMC-7721 CD147-R. Notably, SMMC7721 CD147-R showed high sensitivity to AC-73. The
inhibition ratio of 10 μM AC-73 reached nearly 50% in
SMMC-7721 CD147-R, compared with less than 1% in

suggested that AC-73 decreased the motility and invasive
ability of HCC cells by targeting CD147.

ERK1/2 to drive biological functions in cancer cells [23].
Therefore, we hypothesized that AC-73 inhibited HCC
metastasis by disrupting CD147 dimerization and reducing
downstream ERK/STAT3/MMPs signaling.
Given that MMPs are considered to be vital factors
in tumor invasion and metastasis, we first evaluated
whether AC-73 affected MMPs production in SMMC7721 cells. MMPs were reported to induce tumor
progression in HCC including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3,
MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-11 and MMP-13 [24]. Therefore
we examined the effect of AC-73 on mRNA expression
of these MMPs by quantitative real-time PCR in SMMC7721 cells. We observed AC-73 could significantly
inhibit both MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression
at the concentration of 10 μM, especially MMP-2, but
no obvious effect on MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP11 nor MMP-13 (Supplementary Figure S2A). Then
further study of MMP-2 showed that AC-73 could dose
dependently reduce the expression of MMP-2 mRNA

AC-73 inhibits the invasion of HCC cells by
reducing MMP-2 production through blocking
CD147-stimulated MAPK/STAT3 signaling
Our previous work has shown that disruption of
CD147 dimerization attenuates MAPK activation and
MMP-2 induction [15]. We also noticed that the MAPK
family member ERK1/2 can influence the migration
and invasion of HCC cells [18] and that activity of
STAT3 is necessary for invasion in HCC [19,20].
Accordingly, STAT3 knockdown reduces in vitro and
in vivo invasiveness by suppressing MMP-2 in HCC [21].
A pertinent finding is that CD147 serves as an upstream
activator of STAT3 signaling [22]. Furthermore, as a key
transcription factor, STAT3 may be phosphorylated by

level and secretion of the protein level using RT-qPCR
analysis and gelatin zymography experiments, (Figure
4A and 4B). Next, we wonder whether the inhibition
of metastatic behavior by AC-73 can be circumvented
through overexpression of MMP-2. Both plasmids
overexpressing MMP-2 (EX-Z5731-M98-5) and negative
control (EX-NEG-M98) were transfected in SMMC7721 cells respectively. After evaluation of transfection
efficiency (Supplementary Figure S2B), we detected the
invasion ability of SMMC-7721 cells with or without
AC-73 using transwell assay. Results showed that
comparing SMMC-7721 cells, overexpressing MMP-2
in SMMC-7721 cells presented stronger invasion ability.
While, with the treatment of AC-73, the inhibition of
metastatic behavior were circumvented comparing to the
normal SMMC-7721 cells, but not totally circumvented
(Supplementary Figure S2C and S2D). We thought this
results may indicated that MMP-2 is the key downstream
signaling molecule regulated by AC-73. However, the
reduction of invasion by AC-73 were not due to only
this one signaling pathway. After that, we performed
western blot assay to show that AC-73 did not change
the protein expression of CD147, ERK1/2 and STAT3.
But the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 was
dose-dependently suppressed in SMMC-7721 cells after
treatment with AC-73 for 6 hrs. (Figure 4C and 4D).
Then, we determined whether AC-73 induced phosphoSTAT3 (p-STAT3) reduction via ERK1/2. Results showed
p-STAT3, but not total STAT3, could be suppressed
after treatment with ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD0325901).
In contrast, neither phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) nor
total ERK1/2 could be suppressed by STAT3 inhibitor
(WP1066), suggesting that STAT3 acts downstream of
ERK1/2 (Figure 4E and 4F). From these data, it was no
obvious difference in p-STAT3 expression following
treatment with WP1066 alone or with both WP1066
and AC-73, suggesting that AC-73 could specifically
regulate STAT3 via ERK1/2. Notably, both inhibitors
were evaluated for their roles in tumor invasion. In
Supplementary Figure S2E and S2F, we found reduction
of HCC cell invasion when blocked with PD0325901 and
WP1066. Finally, in a parallel experiment, we explored
how AC-73 affected the related signaling pathways
(Figure 4G and 4H). We observed that AC-73 notably
reduced p-ERK1/2 and p-STAT3 in the two parental HCC
cell lines, but not the HCC CD147-/- lines, indicating
that AC-73 inhibits ERK/STAT3 signaling via specific
binding to CD147.
Considering about both STAT3 and ERK signaling
are implicated in cell growth, we also evaluated the
effect of AC-73 on HCC proliferation in vitro and found
no obvious effect when the concentrations of AC-73 is
less than 20 μM within 7 days (Supplementary Figure
S3A). Meanwhile, the proteins of Survivin and CylinD1,
regarded as proliferation related signaling molecules, were
comparable expression when treating with or without
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

AC-73, detected by western blot. In contrary, MMP-2
expression could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure S3B). All these results indicated
AC-73 tends to inhibit metastasis rather than proliferation
in HCC.
To sum up, AC-73 inhibited HCC metastasis by
disrupting CD147 dimerization and reducing downstream
ERK1/2/STAT3/MMP-2 signaling.

AC-73 reduces HCC metastasis in vivo
The effect of AC-73 on inhibiting HCC metastasis
was assessed in an orthotopic transplant nude mouse
model. We performed orthotopic implantation of
SMMC-7721 cells into the left liver lobe of the nude
mice. One week after implantation, when tumor is well
established, the mice were treated with Cremophor
EL/ethanol or different concentrations of AC-73.
Enumeration of intrahepatic metastases revealed that
AC-73 significantly decreased the incidence of metastatic
foci in nude mice, evaluated by gross pathology
(Figure 5A and 5B). Then, through tissue pathology
examination of original orthotopic tumors, we found
compared with Cremophor EL/ethanol, AC-73 inhibited
the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 in a dosedependent manner by both Western blot (Figure 5C and
5D) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses (Figure
5E), suggesting that AC-73 suppresses the ERK/STAT3
pathway in vivo. Further, as a key downstream signaling
molecule, expression of MMP-2 was detected by IHC.
Results indicated MMP-2 was also reduced by AC-73.
Meanwhile, we also detected CD147 expression in tissue
and found no significant difference among each group
(Figure 5E). Notably, all these results were as similar as
we got by western blot in vitro. Additionally, we detected
about both in situ and metastatic foci by histology and
observed AC-73 couldn’t inhibit tumor cell proliferation in
vivo as well as in vitro through calculating the maximum
tumor diameter of in situ focal (Supplementary Figure
S3C and S3D).

AC-73 presents low toxicity and well tolerance in
nude mice
In a toxicity test, 6-week-old male nude mice
were treated with or without AC-73. Toxicity of AC73 were evaluated by mice body weight, aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) catalytic activities in serum, apoptosis detection
and H&E staining of major organs when mice were
sacrificed after more than 20 days. Results showed that
AC-73 did not cause obvious changes in body weight
of nude mice in each group (Figure 6A). In addition,
comparing with vehicle group (Cremophor EL/ethanol),
both ALT and AST enzyme levels did not rise abnormally
but basically maintained within normal range in AC-73

DISCUSSION

groups (Figure 6B and 6C). To further evaluate whether
AC-73 could cause liver damage, we detected apoptosis
of liver tissue in each experiment group by tunel staining
and found neither vehicle nor AC-73 could significantly
cause apoptosis in hepatocytes, the total number of
positive cells in each group were less than 1% (Figure
6D). In the end, through H&E staining, AC-73 didn’t
affect other major organs comparing with vehicle group
(Figure 6E). Over all, all the in vivo results indicated AC73 was well tolerated and might qualify as a candidate
drug for HCC Intervention.

In the present study, we have identified the novel
candidate small-molecule compound AC-73, which binds
to the N-terminal IgC2 domain of CD147, preventing
CD147 dimerization. Accordingly, the reduction in CD147
signaling leads to lower MMP-2 production, apparently
through suppression of the MAPK/STAT3 signaling
pathway (Figure 8). The resulting diminished motility and
loss of invasiveness in HCC cells appears to culminate in
reduced metastasis. To our knowledge, AC-73 is the first
small-molecule inhibitor targeting CD147 that may be
used as a potential intervention for HCC metastasis.
In recent years, improved knowledge of the
oncogenic processes and signaling pathways in HCC
has revealed several potential therapeutic targets and has
driven the development of molecular targeted therapies
[25]. As a milestone, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib
unveiled a new direction for subsequent research[26], and
many small-molecule drugs targeting specific oncogene
alterations or abnormal signaling cascades are currently
in clinical trials [27]. However, several of these drugs
have adverse effects due to their low specificity, and
most of them are designed to affect cell proliferation,
differentiation and angiogenesis, rather than invasion
and metastasis, which are mainly responsible for HCC
mortality[7,28]. Current drugs, such as dasatinib (XL228),
which targets insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling,
and benzoic acid derivative, which blocks hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) signaling, appear to reduce HCC
metastases, but their critical molecular targets remain
unclear [29,30]. Thus, novel approaches to treating HCC
metastasis are urgently needed.
CD147 plays important roles in cancer. Indeed, it
has many characteristics of an ideal cancer target: (1)
CD147 is relatively specific for cancer cells because it is
not expressed or is expressed at very low levels in normal
cells but is overexpressed in cancer cells [9,31–34]; (2)
overexpression of CD147 is associated with malignant
biological phenotypes and/or a poor prognosis [35–38];
(3) inhibition of CD147 is efficacious because it is widely
implicated in motility and invasion of HCC cells [9, 16,
39–41]; (4) CD147 is very “drugable,” as a cell surface
molecule that can be easily screened for small-molecule
inhibition or targeted by a specific antibody [42]. Thus,
targeting of CD147 may effectively delay or prevent
metastasis and prolong patient survival.
There is no doubt that mAbs have become the
most rapidly expanding class of pharmaceuticals for
treating diverse human diseases, including cancer [43].
Given that CD147 is a potential drug target in cancer,
our laboratory has developed Licartin, an 131I-labeled
antibody against CD147 that has been approved as a
new drug for the treatment of primary HCC by the China
State Food and Drug Administration (No. S20050039,
April 2005). In a clinical trial, detailed results showed

AC-73 likely binds to the dimer interface of
CD147
Having determined that AC-73 can inhibit the
CD147-mediated metastatic features of HCC, we finally
identified the possible key AC-73-binding residues
in CD147. Using PyMOL (http://pymol.sourceforge.
net/), the binding simulation (Figure 7A) revealed
multiple hydrogen bonds between AC-73 and two amino
acid residues (Glu64 and Glu73) in the active site. In
particular, the carboxylic group of Glu64 was involved
in forming two hydrogen bonds, namely, with N and the
hydroxyl-group O of AC-73. Meanwhile, the side chain
of Glu73 formed a hydrogen bond with the phenolic
hydroxyl of AC-73. In addition, we predicted the most
probable contact residues by calculating the energy
contributions of those residues within 10Å of AC-73
using Glide software. As shown in Table 2, Glu64 and
Glu73, located in the N-terminal domain of CD147,
presented the greatest predicted energy contributions.
To verify the computer simulation results, the binding
of AC-73 to CD147wt and two CD147 mutants
(CD147mts)—E64A and E73A—was compared by SPR
assay. In contrast to the effective binding of AC-73 to
CD147wt, the compound’s binding to both CD147mts
was negligible (Figure 7B).
To further confirm this observation, the effects of
AC-73 on the dimerization of different constructs was
evaluated using a native PAGE assay. As shown in Figure
7C and 7D, AC-73 could only disrupt the dimerization
of CD147wt, and not that of the CD147mts. Moreover,
similar results were obtained in an invasion assay of living
cells expressing either CD147wt or the glutamate mutants.
On the premise of almost equally CD147 expression
(Supplementary Figure S1E and S1F), CD147wt rendered
the cells highly sensitive to AC-73 whereas three cell
lines expressing the single glutamate mutants or a double
mutant (E64A and E73A) were less sensitive, suggesting
that Glu64 and Glu73 of CD147 are indispensable for
AC-73-dependent inhibition of CD147-mediated HCC
invasion (Figure 7E and 7F). Taken together, these data
demonstrated that AC-73 binds to the N-terminal IgC2
domain of CD147 predominantly through Glu64 and
Glu73, although it is likely that other residues contribute.

that Licartin significantly decreased the tumor recurrence
rate by 30.4% and increased the survival rate by 20.6%
[44]. However, the inclusion of radioactive 131I in Licartin
may become a potential problem for large-scale clinical
application. Moreover, the possible immunogenicity of
Licartin, resulting in the development of human antimouse antibodies (HAMA), should be prevented. In
contrast, AC-73 is relatively safe, specific for its binding
target and well tolerated in vivo. Additionally, similar to
most small-molecule drugs, AC-73 has the advantages
of ease of manufacture, low cost and the prospect of oral
bioavailability [45–47]. Furthermore, the results showing
anti-metastatic activity for AC-73 due to a reduction in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MMP production are similar to those obtained with the
treatment of CD147-blocking mAbs [10]. Consequently, it
is a worthwhile goal to characterize small-molecule drugs
targeting CD147. Notably, the anti-CD147 antibody HAb18
was included as a positive control in the present work
because no other small molecules targeting CD147 have
been reported thus far, and we needed to verify the efficacy
of AC-73 and the accuracy of our experimental system.
However, this antibody would not be the most appropriate
positive control for AC-73 in most in vitro assays due to
these inhibitors’ different natures and quantities.
In this present work, we focused on AC-73 efficacy
in HCC. Actually, a variety of important risk factors for
9441

the development of HCC have not been ignored. These
include chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection,
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, alcohol intake
and cirrhosis of almost any cause [48]. Interestingly, our
previous study reported that highly expressed CD147 not
only involves HCC parenchymal cells, but also exists
in the perisinusoidal area of liver cirrhosis patients,
suggesting this molecule may have a role in liver fibrosis
and cirrhosis [49]. Therefore, as a target of CD147, AC73 or its derivative could be supposed to reverse Cirrhosis
progress effectively in the future.
Indeed, as a lead compound, AC-73 needs to be
modified in further studies. First, the exact binding
interface between AC-73 and CD147 should be further
explored in structural experiments. Second, the unique
chiral group in AC-73 should be improved to make the
compound easily synthesizable and purifiable.
Finally, as we know, liver plays vital role in the
pharmacokinetics of the majority of drugs. Therefore, it
is necessary to study the pharmacokinetics of modified
compounds based on AC-73. The related metabolic
parameters of compounds should be evaluated to ensure
hepatocytes and even abnormal liver cells have the ability
to metabolic compounds in a certain range of doses. Taken
together, AC-73 should be modified to increase the activity
and ensure safety in the future.
In conclusion, our findings reveal a promising
therapeutic application of AC-73. Such an approach may
have benefits in reducing HCC metastasis when used
either alone or in combination with other therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Compound

Plasmids and site-directed mutagenesis

AC-73 (3-{2-[([1, 1’-biphenyl]-4-ylmethyl) amino]1-hydroxyethyl} phenol) was screened and purchased
from the Specs chemistry database (Specs ID number
AN-465/42834501). In this present work, a total of
two vehicles were used. The compound was dissolved
in 20% DMSO (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and diluted in
DMEM to the desired concentration, with a final DMSO
concentration of no more than 0.2% for all in vitro
studies. For in vivo experiments, AC-73 was dissolved
in Cremophor EL/ethanol (50:50; Sigma Cremophor EL,
95% ethyl alcohol) at 4-fold of the highest dose and stored
at room temperature.

Three plasmids—pCMV-HA-CD147, pEGFP-N1CD147 and pcDNA3.1-CD147 (WT)—were constructed
in this present work. Briefly, the following plasmids
were used: pCMV-HA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA,
US), peGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, US),
pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The coding
sequence of CD147 (NM_198589) was inserted into
pCMV-HA with Hind III and Xho I, into peGFP-N1
with Xho I and BamH I, and into pcDNA3.1 with EcoR
I and Xho I to produce pCMV-HA-CD147, pEGFP-N1CD147 and pcDNA3.1-CD147 (WT) seprately. Another
three mutation plasmids, termed pcDNA3.1-CD147
(E64A), pcDNA3.1-CD147 (E73A) and pcDNA3.1CD147 (E64A and E73A), were prepared for a parallel
controlled trial. Plasmids of overexpressing MMP-2 (EXZ5731-M98-5) and negative control (EX-NEG-M98) were
bought by GeneCopoeia. Site-directed mutagenesis was
performed with the QuikChange Lightning Multi SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) in an expression

features of each cluster were averaged, and only the center
was used for further study. Next, the Screen Library
protocol in Discovery Studio was used to enumerate
possible subsets of pharmacophores and to screen the
ligands against each pharmacophore. Each pharmacophore
subset contained a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 7
features. During virtual screening, the protocol analyzed
large collections of features and extracted the most
relevant ones for each query ligand. According to the
fitting value, the top 5,000 ligands were selected and
submitted to further in situ ligand minimization, followed
by a free energy binding calculation. Finally, the top
1,000 compounds with the best free energy binding
were selected for conformational and structural diversity
analysis. We chose 100 of the highest-scoring compounds
from the biological test.

Expression and purification of extracellular
portion of HAb18G/CD147 tagged with 6 × His
Extracellular portion of CD147 (residues 22–205
of CD147) was inserted into pET21a (+) (Novagen)
with NdeI and XhoI. The construct was transformed
into the Origami(DE3) strain and grown in LB, yielding
secretion of soluble CD147 extracellular portion by
adding isopropyl-1-thio-A-D -galactopyranoside (IPTG)
to a final concentration of 0.1 mM (culture for 16 h at
24°C). Harvested cells were suspended in lysis buffer
(20 mM potassiumphosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl,
1 mg/ml lysozyme (RocheApplied Science), 1mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, pepstatin,
andleupeptin) and lysed on a French press at 20,000
p.s.i. The cell lysate was centrifuged twice at 12,000g
for 45min. The soluble fraction was applied to a HisTrap chelating 5-ml column (AmershamBiosciences Co.,
Germany), previously charged with Ni2+, in an AktaFPLC. Eluted product was further purified a Superdex 75
gel-filtration column. The antigen was identified through
the molecular weight and Western blot.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay
SPR measurements were performed using the
ProteOn XPR36 system with ProteOn GLH sensor chips.
ProteOn PBS/Tween running buffer (phosphate-buffered
saline, pH 7.4, with 0.005% Tween 20) containing 0.1%
DMSO was used as a running buffer throughout, and all
experiments were performed at 25°C. Purified CD147wt
or CD147mt was immobilized on a GLH chip. Each
compound was used at the same concentration (100 μM)
and simultaneously injected in the horizontal direction,
with running buffer injected as a control. Dissociation
was monitored for 15 min. The data were analyzed using
ProteOn Manager Software, version 2.0.

WST-1 cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay
To evaluate the effect of AC-73 on cell proliferation
and viability, a WST-1 assay (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Specifically, for cell viability test, SMMC7721 and Huh-7 cells were first seeded on 96-well
plates (5.0 × 103 cells/well)with 100μl media and
incubated at 37°C overnight. After treatment with various
concentrations of AC-73 (1.0, 5.0, 10.0 or 20.0 μM) for
48 hrs. For proliferation test, 7721 cells were seeded on
96-well plates (2.0 × 103 cells/well) with 100μl media
containing 3 concentrations of AC-73 (0, 10.0 or 20.0 μM)
and incubated at 37°C for 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7 days, respectively.
After incubation, 10 μl WST-1 reagent was added to each
well, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 hrs. The
plates were read on a microplate reader (OD450) after
being shaken thoroughly [54].

Pharmacophore model and virtual screening
A structure-based pharmacophore model was
constructed to characterize the possible interactions
between the dimerization area of CD147 and hit
compounds. Virtual screening was performed using
the Specs database, which contains more than 300,000
commercially available compounds. The detailed
procedures are described as follows.
The X-ray crystal structure of HAb18G/CD147 was
retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 3N5H),
and one monomer was extracted and prepared using
Discovery Studio. Previous studies have shown that the
N-terminal domain of CD147 plays an important role in
its dimerization and physiological functions [15]. Thus,
an active-site sphere was located in the region covering
the key residues and used to create a Ludi interaction
map, which consisted of a hydrogen bond acceptor and
donor with hydrophobic features. Furthermore, exclusive
volumes were added as constraints. This approach
generated a large number of features, and thus, hierarchical
clustering was performed. To this end, the pharmacophore

Non-denaturing SDS-PAGE assay
To evaluate whether AC-73 could inhibit the
dimerization of CD147 in a Prokaryotic expression system,
non-denaturing SDS-PAGE followed by a Western blot
assay was used as previously described [15]. Both CD147wt

and CD147mts were purified, and 5 μg of each was added
to various concentrations of AC-73 (0, 0.1, 0.25, or 0.5 μM)
and mixed with 5× Laemmli sample buffer lacking SDS,
followed by resolution by 10% SDS-PAGE without boiling
and immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibody.

China) Real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR
Premix Ex Taq II Kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology).

Gelatin zymography experiments
Gelatin zymography experiments were performed as
described previously[55]. For preliminary screening, THP1 cells were incubated with each of 100 compounds at a
concentration of 50 μM. To check the secretion of MMP2, cells were incubated with or without AC-73 at 37°C
for 5 to 24 hrs. Media samples were then centrifuged to
remove cellular debris, and the supernatant was collected.
To evaluate the effect of AC-73 on MMP-2 secretion
in HCC cells, SMMC-7721 cells were cultured with or
without AC-73 in serum-free media and incubated at 37°C
for 5 to 20 hrs. After which the supernatant was obtained.
Each sample suspension (30μl) was mixed with SDS
sample buffer without reducing agent and loaded onto a
10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin. After
electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice in 2.5% Triton
X-100 for 15 min and then incubated in incubation buffer
for 16 hrs. Next, the gels were stained with Coomassie
brilliant blue and destained. The inhibition ratio (%) for
MMP-2 secretion was calculated as follows: (1-gray value
of MMP-2 in the treatment group/gray value of MMP-2 in
the control group) × 100%.

Co-IP assay
This assay was performed to evaluate the effect of
AC-73 on CD147 dimerization in living cells. HEK293T
cells were co-transfected with pCMV-HA-CD147 and
pEGFP-N1-CD147. After 24 h, cells were treated with
AC-73 or vehicle control in low-FBS media (0.2% FBS)
for an additional 6 hrs. Cell lysates were prepared, and
30 μg of each protein sample was used for a co-IP assay
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The eluted
protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
Western blotting.

In vitro scratch assay
An in vitro scratch assay was performed to evaluate
the mobility of HCC cells. Cells (SMMC-7721 and Huh7) were seeded on 24-well plates. After 24 h of culture,
each well was manually scratched with a 10 μl pipette
tip, washed with PBS three times and incubated with
AC-73 (5 or 10 mM) at 37°C. The anti-CD147 antibody
HAb18 was used as a positive control. The scratch area
was photographed 24h later. The distance between two cell
edges was analyzed using Image J software (NIH).

Western blot analysis
HCC cells were suspended in serum-free media on
a six-well plate at a density of 2.5 × 105/ml. A total of
2 ml of cell suspension was utilized, containing different
concentrations of drug or inhibitor. After cell attachment,
the conditioned media were collected. Tumor samples
were minced on ice in prechilled lysis buffer containing
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors, and
phosphatase inhibitors (KeyGen BioTech, China). The
homogenized tissues and cell lysates were then centrifuged
at 14,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min. The BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) was employed to
determine the total protein density and to ensure that equal
amounts of proteins were separated on the 10% SDSPAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Boston, MA). After
blocking with 5% nonfat milk for 1 hr. The membrane
was incubated with the designated primary antibody at
4°C overnight. Immunodetection was performed using
the Western-Light chemiluminescent detection system
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) after incubation
with the secondary antibody for 1 hr.

Invasion assay
The transwell system (24 wells, 8 mm pore size,
polycarbonate membrane; Corning Costar, Lowell, MA,
USA) was coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and
used for the in vitro invasion assays. A total of 1 × 105
cells were suspended in 300 μl serum-free media, and AC73 (5 and 10 μM) was added to the upper chambers. Then,
500 μl DMEM containing 20% FBS was added to the
lower chamber. After 24 h, the transwells were moved to a
fresh 24-well plate and stained with 0.2% crystal violet for
20 min. The number of cells that had attached to the lower
surface was counted in five randomly selected fields under
a light microscope and statistically analyzed.

RNA extraction, reverse transcription and realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(RT-qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol Reagent
(OMEGA Bio-Tek).
Reverse transcription was performed using the
PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology).

implantation. The number of intrahepatic metastases was
calculated and statistically analyzed. Tumor tissues were
then fixed, embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned
at a thickness of 4 mm. IHC staining was performed, and
the sections were examined by a pathologist to verify the
presence of tumors.

All experiments were performed in triplicate, and
the results are expressed as the mean ± SD. Statistics were
evaluated using GraphPad Prism V5.0 software (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA). The statistical analysis was
carried out using one-way ANOVA (multiple comparisons)
and Student’s t-test (two comparisons, or two tailed).
Differences were deemed significant if P < 0.05.
*** indicates P < 0.001, ** indicates P < 0.01, * indicates
P < 0.05, and # indicates P > 0.05. IC50 was analyzed by
nonlinear regression (curve fit) in the GraphPad Prism 5.0
software.
