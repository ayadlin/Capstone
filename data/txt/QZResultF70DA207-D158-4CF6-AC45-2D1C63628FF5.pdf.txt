Abstract
Inhibitory receptors on immune cells are pivotal regulators of immune escape in cancer. Among these
inhibitory receptors, CTLA-4 (targeted clinically by ipilimumab) serves as a dominant off-switch while other
receptors such as PD-1 and LAG-3 seem to serve more subtle rheostat functions. However, the extent of synergy
and cooperative interactions between inhibitory pathways in cancer remain largely unexplored. Here, we reveal
extensive coexpression of PD-1 and LAG-3 on tumor-inﬁltrating CD4þ and CD8þ T cells in three distinct
transplantable tumors. Dual anti–LAG-3/anti–PD-1 antibody treatment cured most mice of established tumors
that were largely resistant to single antibody treatment. Despite minimal immunopathologic sequelae in PD-1 and
LAG-3 single knockout mice, dual knockout mice abrogated self-tolerance with resultant autoimmune inﬁltrates
in multiple organs, leading to eventual lethality. However, Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice showed markedly increased
survival from and clearance of multiple transplantable tumors. Together, these results deﬁne a strong synergy
between the PD-1 and LAG-3 inhibitory pathways in tolerance to both self and tumor antigens. In addition, they
argue strongly that dual blockade of these molecules represents a promising combinatorial strategy for cancer.

tion against metastases (1). Although the immune system can
detect and destroy malignant cells, tumors escape surveillance
by a variety of cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms (1–3). As
with chronic viral infection (4), tumor antigen-speciﬁc CD4þ
and CD8þ T cells display impaired effector function and an
exhausted phenotype characterized by decreased production
of proinﬂammatory cytokines and hyporesponsiveness to
antigenic restimulation (5). This is mediated by cell extrinsic
mechanisms, such as regulatory T cells (Treg), and cell intrinsic
mechanisms, such as inhibitory molecules that are upregulated
on exhausted, tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL). In combination, these inhibitory mechanisms represent a formidable
barrier to effective antitumor immunity (6–10).
Inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4, CD152), lymphocyte-activation gene
3 (LAG-3, CD223), and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1, CD279)
function at multiple levels to ensure appropriate T-cell homeostasis, activation, and differentiation (7, 11–17). Furthermore,
all 3 inhibitory molecules also contribute to cell extrinsic
regulation by controlling Treg homeostasis and function, mediating induced Treg development, and mitigating dendritic
cell differentiation and function (13–16, 18, 19). Data from
genetically manipulated mice indicate that CTLA-4 represents
a basic and indispensible "off switch," whereas PD-1 and LAG3 play more subtle roles in immune regulation. Whereas
Ctla4/ mice develop a severe lymphoproliferative disease
and are usually moribund by 3 to 4 weeks of age (20), Pdcd1/

(which encodes PD-1) mice live beyond 1 year while developing
subtle and variable immune-based disease manifestations
depending on genetic background; Pdcd1/ BALB/c mice
develop dilated cardiomyopathy 5 to 30 weeks of age, whereas
Pdcd1/ C57BL/6 mice develop a protracted lupus-like condition that takes over 6 months to develop (21, 22). Unmanipulated Lag3/ C57BL/6 mice do not develop any disease
manifestations within the ﬁrst year of life (23).
Recent studies have revealed that LAG-3 and PD-1 are
coexpressed on tolerized TILs suggesting that they may contribute to tumor-mediated immune suppression (5, 24). Preclinical models using antibody treatment to block LAG-3 for
cancer treatment show enhanced activation of antigen-speciﬁc
T cells at the tumor site and disruption of tumor growth (25).
Abrogation of PD1 signaling in mice leads to enhanced CTL
killing, cytokine production, and tumor-bearing animal survival over several different tumor models (26). On the basis of
their roles in T-cell inhibition and antitumor immune regulation, individual antibody blockade of both CTLA-4 and PD-1
have been reported to show clinical utility (27, 28). Given this
information, LAG-3 and PD-1 represent a potentially beneﬁcial
pairing for dual pathway blockade in cancer therapy. However,
little is known about the extent of cooperative interaction
between these regulatory pathways, information critical to the
development of combinatorial immunotherapy based on
simultaneous blockade of multiple receptors or ligands. In
this study, we investigate whether there is synergy between
LAG-3 and PD-1 by analysis of tumor growth and clearance in
blocking antibody-treated mice and Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice.

Materials and Methods
Mouse strains and cell lines
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.
Lag3/ mice were provided by Y.H. Chien (Stanford
University) with permission from C. Benoist and D. Mathis
(Joslin Diabetes Center; refs. 23, 29). Pdcd1/ mice were
provided by Lieping Chen (Johns Hopkins University) with
permission from T. Honjo (Kyoto University; ref. 30). At St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital, the Lag3/, Pdcd1/ and
Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL/6
background an additional 5, 9, and 5 generations respectively,
and a genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis
indicated that 100% of the markers were C57BL/6 for Lag3/
and Pdcd1/ mice and 90% for the Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice. At
Johns Hopkins, the Lag3/Pdcd1/ were backcrossed 5
generations onto a B10.D2 background and crossed with Clone
4 (CL4) TCR transgenic mice. Animal experiments were carried
out in speciﬁc pathogen-free facilities accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care (AAALAC) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and
Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and approved by the
respective Animal Care and Use Committees. The mice at St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital are also Helicobacter- and
MNV free. B16 melanoma cells were obtained from MJ Turk
(Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH). This line has been authenticated by the RADIL at the University of Missouri (September
18, 2008) and maintained in continuous culture for no more

than 6 months posttesting. It was also tested by IMPACT I PCR
Proﬁle at the RADIL at the University of Missouri (October 10,
2008). MC38 cells were obtained from J.P. Allison (Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, NY), authenticated by the
RADIL (March 10, 2003), and tested by IMPACT I at the RADIL
at the University of Missouri (March 18, 2010). Sa1N cells were
originally obtained from J.P. Allison (Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center, NY). Although these cells have not been authenticated, they perform as described in the literature in syngeneic
A/J mice (14) and tested by IMPACT I at the RADIL at the
University of Missouri (January 29, 2011).
Flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and
cytokine analysis
Single-cell suspensions were prepared from spleens, inguinal, brachial, and axillary lymph nodes, and tumors. Cells were
stained with ﬂuorescent-labeled antibodies (BioLegend, BDBioscience Pharmingen, or eBiosciences) and analyzed by
either FACSCalibur or LSR II ﬂow cytometer (BD). The following clones were used: CD4 (GK1.5), CD8a (53–6.7), CD11c
(N418), CD25 (PC61), CD44 (IM7), CD45R/B220 (RA3–6B2),
CD69 (H1.2F3), PD-1 (RMP1–30), TCR-b (H57–597), Thy1.1
(HIS51), IFN-g (XMG1.2), TNF-a (MP6-XT22), IL-17 (TC11–
18H10), Foxp3 (150D), and LAG-3 (4–10-C9; ref. 31). For
intracellular cytokine staining, cells were activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 100 ng/mL) plus ionomycin
(500 ng/mL) for 4 hours in the presence of GolgiPlug (32),
processed with a Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm kit (32), and stained as
indicated. Measurement of IFN-g, TNF-a, and MCP-1 in serum
was determined by IFN-g- or TNF-a–speciﬁc ELISA kits
(eBioscience) and a MCP-1–speciﬁc bead based kit (Millipore).
Tumor growth experiments and TIL preparation
B16 melanoma and MC38 colon adenocarcinoma models
were carried out as previously described with some modiﬁcations (33, 34). Brieﬂy, on day 0 mice were injected with 1.25 
105 to 5.0  105 B16 cells i.d. in the back or 2.0  106 to 5.0  106
MC38 cells subcutaneously (s.c) in the right ﬂank. Lag3/
Pdcd1/ (and appropriate controls) were used at approximately 5 weeks of age. Tumor diameter was measured every 2
to 3 days with an electronic caliper and reported as volume
using the formula m12  m2  p/6 (35). To isolate TILs, solid
tumors were excised after 12 to 14 days, single-cell suspensions
prepared by mechanical dissociation, followed by density
gradient centrifugation on an 80%/40% Percoll (GE Healthcare) gradient. For CD4þ and CD8þ T-cell depletion experiments, anti-mouse CD4 (GK1.5) and anti-mouse CD8 (2.43)
ascites were administered i.p. on days 1, 2, 5, 8, and 11
(pretitered for maximal deletion).
Dual antibody blocking experiments
Sa1N ﬁbrosarcoma cells or MC38 cells (2  106) were
implanted s.c. into A/J mice (Harlan) or C57Bl/6 mice (Charles
River), respectively. Tumor volumes were measured with an
electronic caliper (l  w  h/2) and randomized by size (10
mice per group). Mice with palpable tumors (Sa1N 60 mm3/2;
MC38 40 mm3/2) were injected i.p. at a dosage of 10 mg/kg
for chimeric mouse anti-PD-1 (4H2, IgG1; ref. 36) and/or rat

anti-mouse LAG-3 (C9B7W, IgG1; ref. 37). Control murine IgG1
(MOPC 21; BioXCell) was dosed at 20 mg/kg or added to
individual anti–PD-1 or anti–LAG-3 antibody treatments at
10 mg/kg. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated when
all mice within a group were available for tumor measurement.
Adoptive transfer into Rag-1/ mice
Splenocytes and lymph node cells from female mice (5–7
weeks old) were pooled, and 107 cells injected i.v. into agematched female Rag-1/ (5–6 weeks old) mice. CD4þ or CD8þ
cells were depleted from splenocytes and lymph node cells
with biotinylated anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 by macrophage separation using streptavidin-coupled beads (Milteny Biotec) to
achieve purity above 95%.
Histopathology
Full necropsies were completed independently at St Jude
Children's Research Hospital and Johns Hopkins. Tissues
from knockout and control mice were ﬁxed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin, except eyes, which were ﬁxed for 24 hours
in Davidson's ﬁxative, embedded in parafﬁn, sectioned at 4
mm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic examination. Collagen deposition was detected by a
Masson's Trichrome stain. Macrophages and T cells were
detected using rat anti-mouse MAC2 (CL8942AP; Accurate
Chemical) and goat anti-human CD3 (sc-1127; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) antibodies, respectively. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was carried out by heating slides in ER2
(AR9640; Leica) for 30 minutes and the Reﬁne system
(DS9800; Leica Microsystems) used for detection. Treg cells
were detected with a rat anti-mouse FoxP3 antibody (14–
5773-82; eBioscience) with heat-induced retrieval, pH 6.0,
target retrieval buffer (S699; Dako) followed by a horseradish
peroxidase–labeled streptavidin detection system (TS-125HR; Thermo Shandon). In all immunohistochemical assays,
3,30 -diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogenic substrate with a light hematoxylin counterstain.
Autoantibody analysis
Mouse sera were analyzed by indirect ELISA, alongside a
positive control (serum from a MRL/lpr mouse, a SLE disease
model), using 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp plates (Nalgene Nunc).
Multiple antigen blot assay (MABA) was conducted as
described (38).
Clone 4 TCR transgenic T-cell experiments
CL4 adoptive transfer and in vivo CTL studies were carried
out as previously described (25, 39).
Statistical analyses
Summary statistics are presented as mean  SEM. Group
means were compared with 2-sample t tests. Event-free survival (moribund) estimates were calculated with the Kaplan–
Meier method; mouse groups were compared by log-rank test.
The proportions of tumor-free mice were evaluated with the
binomial distribution; synergy hypotheses were tested based
on the maximum likelihood method. Trends in weight over
time and tumor growth over time among different mice groups

www.aacrjournals.org

were analyzed using mixed models. All P values are 2-sided, and
statistical signiﬁcance was assessed at the 0.05 level. Analysis
was conducted by SAS (version 9.2).

Results
Combinatorial anti–LAG-3/anti–PD-1 immunotherapy
inhibits tumor growth
PD-1 monoclonal antibody treatment has shown clinical
efﬁcacy against multiple malignancies including melanoma,
prostate, renal cell, and lung cancer (27). LAG-3 has been
suggested to directly modulate the activity of PD-1þ cells (5);
furthermore, coexpression of LAG-3 and PD-1 has been
shown in malignant mouse and human tissue (5, 24). Given
these data, we hypothesized that LAG-3 and PD-1 act
synergistically to control immune homeostasis and mediate
tumor-induced tolerance. Consistent with previous reports,
a signiﬁcant percentage of CD4þ and CD8þ TILs from
transplanted B16 melanoma, MC38 colorectal adenocarcinoma, and Sa1N ﬁbrosarcoma expressed high levels of LAG3 and PD-1 (32, 34), whereas similar upregulation was not
observed on peripheral T-cell populations (Fig. 1). Next, we
asked if antibody-mediated dual blockade of these pathways
would reduce tumor growth by assessing the potential
efﬁcacy of combined anti–LAG-3 and anti–PD-1 blockade
in mice with established tumors. Reduced growth of Sa1N
ﬁbrosarcoma and MC38 colorectal adenocarcinoma (32, 40–
42) was observed in some but not all mice treated with the
anti–LAG-3 or anti–PD-1 monotherapy (Fig. 2); only a few
mice were tumor free after 50 days (0%–40%). For anti–LAG3, this is the ﬁrst demonstration of TGI with anti–LAG-3 as a
monotherapy. In striking contrast, 70% and 80% of the Sa1Nand MC38-inoculated mice, respectively, were tumor free
after 50 days following combinatorial anti–LAG-3/anti–PD-1
immunotherapy (Fig. 2). However, this regimen had no effect
against established B16 tumors. Using the maximum likelihood method, there seemed to be a synergistic beneﬁt of
anti–LAG-3/anti–PD-1 combinatorial immunotherapy that
is superior to either the additive effect of anti–LAG-3
and anti–PD-1 or monotherapy. Dual treatment with
anti–LAG-3/anti–PD-1 did not result in immunopathologic
manifestations such as lymphocytic inﬁltration in the Sa1N
ﬁbrosarcoma model as determined by detailed histologic
analysis of multiple tissues. Despite efﬁcient tumor clearance, no evidence of systemic or organ-speciﬁc autoimmunity was observed.
To investigate the mechanism underlying decreased tumor
growth in antibody-treated mice, MC38 tumor-bearing mice
were treated with the antibody combinations used above and
draining lymph node (DLN) T cells, non-DLN (NDLN) T cells,
and TILs analyzed by ﬂow cytometry for phenotype and
effector function. As expected, average tumor size of antiPD1–treated or dual antibody–treated mice was signiﬁcantly
smaller than isotype control or anti-LAG3–treated mice
(Supplementary Fig. S1). A signiﬁcantly higher percentage of
IFN-g þCD8þ T cells were found in the tumor-associated DLNs
of dual antibody–treated mice compared with the monotherapy groups, or cells analyzed from NDLNs (Fig. 3A). Likewise, a

to a lesser extent TNF-aþ CD4þ and CD8þ TILs, were observed
in anti–LAG-3/anti–PD-1–treated mice than in control groups
(Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data suggest that anti–LAG-3/
anti–PD-1 combinatorial immunotherapy may act synergistically to reduce tumor growth by increasing the proportion of
effector T cells in the tumor and DLNs.

Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice developed an early onset (4 weeks
of age), lethal autoimmune condition that resulted in
approximately 80% of the mice moribund by approximately
10 weeks (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S2). The major
histopathologic manifestations included diffuse ﬁbrosing
lymphohistiocytic endocarditis, myocarditis, and pancreatitis (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S3). Extensive
inﬁltration by CD3þ T cells, Foxp3þ Treg cells, and Mac2þF4/80þ macrophages was observed, in conjunction with
substantial collagen deposition but limited B-cell and neutrophil inﬁltration; however, negligible autoantibody reactivity was seen in serum from Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice but
not single knockout or wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig.

of observation. These results show that the PD-1 and LAG-3
pathways synergistically regulate self-reactivity.
Consistent with the histopathology observed, substantially
increased numbers of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells were observed in
the regional LNs, but not the spleens, of Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice
(Fig. 4C, Supplementary Fig. S5). These cells possessed a predominantly activated/memory phenotype as indicated by
CD69/CD44 staining. Nevertheless, there seemed to be minimal
difference in the extent of division in vivo based on ex vivo Ki67
staining, even though Lag3/Pdcd1/ T cells proliferate more
in vitro following anti-CD3 stimulation (data not shown). The
number of CD4þFoxp3þ Treg cells, B cells, and CD11cþ dendritic
cells were also increased in Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice (Fig. 4C,

combined loss of LAG-3 and PD-1 alters Treg cell homeostasis.
To further probe the cellular defects in Lag3/Pdcd1/
mice, we adoptively transferred splenocytes into lymphopenic
Rag-1/ mice. In contrast to healthy wild-type and single
knockout controls, Lag3/Pdcd1/ splenocyte recipients
started to lose body weight approximately 6 days posttransfer
with 100% morbidity by day 20 (Supplementary Fig. S6A

Lag3/Pdcd1/ splenocytes clearly showed that both CD4þ

weight loss data, histologic analysis of CD4þ T-cell–depleted

Lag3/Pdcd1/ splenocyte recipients exhibited a near total
absence of hematopoietic cell precursors in bone marrow and
severe lymphoid depletion in the spleen, LNs, and Peyer's
patches (Supplementary Table S2, Fig. S6E and S7). These data
indicate that CD4þ T cells are primarily responsible for the
pathology observed. Cytokine analysis revealed high levels of
IFN-g, TNF-a, and MCP-1 in the serum of Lag3/Pdcd1/
recipients but not single knockout or wild-type control recipients (Supplementary Fig. S6F–S6H). Taken together, these
data suggest that Lag3/Pdcd1/ splenocyte recipients, in
contrast with their single knockout and wild-type controls,
develop an autoimmune GvHD-like syndrome with evidence of
aplastic anemia and bone marrow failure as a cause of death.
The data thus far suggested that while a reasonable level
of tolerance is maintained in single knockout Lag3/ or

Reduced tumor growth and enhanced survival in
Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice
To continue our analysis of Lag-3/PD-1 synergy in the
regulation of antitumor immunity, we assessed tumor growth
in Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice and controls over time. Of the 3
transplantable tumor models examined in this study, B16 is
regarded as the least immunogenic and thus the hardest to
eliminate by immunologic intervention (32, 34). A low dose
of B16 cells (1.25  105) progressively grew in wild-type
and Lag3/ mice inoculated intradermally at day 0,
whereas limited growth was observed in Pdcd1/ and
Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice (Supplementary Fig. S9A). Although
previous studies suggested that PD-1 deletion did not affect
subcutaneously injected tumor growth (44), our experiments
revealed reduced tumor growth in Pdcd1/ mice compared
with wild-type mice. Paradoxically, Lag3/ mice developed
slightly larger tumors. Whether this is due to reported defects
in natural killer cell cytolysis (23), or an unexpected role of
pDCs, which highly express LAG-3 (45), remains to be determined. Statistical analysis with the maximum likelihood method for synergy found that the lack of tumor growth in the
Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice was greater than the additive effects of
tumor growth in Lag3/ mice and Pdcd1/ mice at day 11
(P < 0.05) and day 13 (P < 0.0005) suggesting that LAG-3 and PD1 synergize to mediate tumor-induced tolerance. Depletion of
CD4þ and CD8þ T cells restored normal B16 tumor growth in
compound-deﬁcient mice, indicating the necessity of adaptive
immunity to the antitumor response (Supplementary Fig. S9B).
As the difference in resistance to B16 growth between
Pdcd1/ and Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice seemed small, we evaluated tumor B16 and MC38 growth at different doses. At
the higher B16 dose (5  105 cells per mouse), wild-type and
Lag3/ mice show uncontrolled tumor growth and lethality
with an average survival time of less than 20 days (Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Fig. S10). Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice (80%) eliminated tumors compared with only 40% of Pdcd1/ mice;
however, B16 survivors did not display autoimmune vitiligo as
is often seen with this model (46). We also investigated growth
of subcutaneously implanted MC38 adenocarcinoma cells at 2
different doses. Whereas MC38 growth and survival were

comparable in Lag3/Pdcd1/ and Pdcd1/ mice when a
low dose (2  105 cells per mouse) was used (70% vs.
71%, respectively; Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S10),
Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice were clearly more effective at preventing high-dose (5  105 cells per mouse) MC38 tumor growth
and ensuring survival (83% vs. 38%, respectively; Fig. 5C and
Supplementary Fig. S10). Phenotypic analysis revealed
enhanced IFN-g expression by Lag3/Pdcd1/ CD4þ and
CD8þ T cells in tumor DLNs compared with wild-type
and Lag3/ mice, and NDLNs from all groups (Fig. 6). These
data suggest that combined loss of LAG-3 and PD-1 limits
tumor-mediated tolerization and enhances tumor-speciﬁc
immunity and resistance to tumor growth.
To further investigate the killing efﬁcacy of Lag3/
Pdcd1/ T cells in vivo in the presence of an established
tumor, clonotypic CL4 CD8þ T cells were transferred into
ProTRAMP male mice, which develop prostate cancer driven
by the probasin promoter and express hemagglutinin. After
vaccination with hemagglutinin-expressing Vaccinia virus,
Lag3/Pdcd1/ recipients showed signiﬁcantly increased
killing ability in comparison with the wild type, and slightly
increased killing efﬁciency in comparison with Pdcd1/
single knockouts (Supplementary Fig. S11). These data support the conclusion that Lag3/Pdcd1/ CD8þ T cells are
less susceptible to tumor-induced tolerance than wildtype cells. Taken together, these data clearly show that
Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice are more capable of resisting highdose tumor growth than Pdcd1/ and wild-type mice.

Discussion
The data presented here illustrate clear synergy between the
inhibitory receptors LAG-3 and PD-1 in controlling immune
homeostasis, preventing autoimmunity, and enforcing tumorinduced tolerance. First, we show coexpression of LAG-3 and
PD-1 on tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes. Second, we show that
dual blockade of these receptors leads to decreased tumor
growth and enhanced antitumor immunity. Importantly, dual
antibody–treated mice show more robust immune responses
than either single-treated group. Third, analysis of mutant
mice revealed a cooperative requirement for LAG-3 and PD1 in maintaining immune homeostasis. Consistent with our
observations following antibody-mediated blockade of LAG-3
and PD-1, Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice prevented growth of highdose B16 and MC38 tumors and ensured survival while single
knockout controls and wild-type mice succumbed to disease.
Taken together, these data reveal an unappreciated synergistic
cooperation between LAG-3 and PD-1 in limiting tumor
growth.
Although anti–LAG-3/anti–PD-1 combinatorial immunotherapy effectively cleared established Sa1N and MC38 tumors,
this therapy was not effective against established B16 tumors.
In contrast, B16 tumors were more difﬁcult to establish in
Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice. B16 is a more difﬁcult tumor to
eradicate than MC38 and Sa1N and thus there could be several
possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy. First,
expression of LAG-3/PD-1 on TILs from B16 is lower than for

MC38 and Sa1N, and this may be below a required threshold for
efﬁcacy upon antibody blockade in tumor-bearing mice.
Second, as the knockout mice would lack LAG-3/PD-1 at
the initiation of tumor inoculation, the immune system
would not have this impediment at the commencement
of an antitumor response. In contrast, the initial stages of
LAG-3/PD-1 upregulation may already have occurred in
tumor-bearing mice at the time of antibody treatment
thereby establishing sufﬁcient tolerance to prevent effective
antitumor immunity. Third, there may be additional regulatory mechanisms that contribute a greater role with B16
that may be sufﬁcient to prevent antitumor immunity when
LAG-3/PD-1 blockade is initiated in mice that already have
tumors. Lastly, we cannot rule out the possibility that the
genetic deletion of LAG-3/PD-1 results in Tregs that have a
cell intrinsic defect in their regulatory capacity which
impacts early tumor establishment. Of course, a combination of these issues could also contribute to the difference in
B16 clearance seen in LAG-3/PD-1 deﬁciency versus late
stage antibody-mediated blockade. It is possible that alternate dosing regimens and therapeutic combinations could
result in effective clearance of established B16 with anti–
LAG-3/anti–PD-1 combinatorial immunotherapy.
It is noteworthy that the percentage of IFN-g þ TILs is
higher in Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice versus anti–LAG-3/anti–
PD-1–treated mice (Fig. 6 vs. Fig. 3). These differences could
be reﬂective of the differences in B16 elimination in LAG-3/
PD-1–deﬁcient versus mAb-treated mice. Alternatively, as

www.aacrjournals.org

discussed above, these observations could be due to the
different tumors analyzed or temporal differences between
these experiments, as IFN-g expression was determined 1
week after mAb treatment compared with 2 weeks after
tumor inoculation into Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice. Finally, we
cannot rule out the possibility that there is a phenotypic
difference in the immune cells in the Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice.
However, there does not seem to be an active systemic defect
at the time of the experiment as high IFN-g expression is not
observed in the NDLN.
Although Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice develop a lethal autoimmune condition, the disease is slower (10 weeks vs. 3–4
weeks) and less penetrant (80% vs. 100%) than the phenotype
observed in Ctla4/ mice (20). Recently, analogous observations were reported by Honjo and colleagues in which
BALB/c mice harboring a loss-of-function mutation in Lag3
combined with genetic deletion of Pdcd1 develop lethal
myocarditis (47). Heart-inﬁltrating T cells from these compound-deﬁcient mice were shown to produce high amounts
of IFNg compared with distal lymphoid organs such as the
spleen. Our results are consistent with their data, as we also
observed enhanced production of proinﬂammatory cytokines by T cells inﬁltrating sites of inﬂammation, such as
the heart and pancreas in Lag3/Pdcd1/ mice and in
tumors and DLNs in knockout and antibody-treated mice.
Furthermore, the Honjo group also observed accelerated
autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice expressing a loss-offunction LAG-3 mutant, consistent with our recent observations in Lag3/ NOD mice (48). However, the mice used by
Honjo and colleagues that lacked functional LAG-3/PD-1
expression were on a BALB/c background, whereas our data
were derived from mice on a C57BL/6 or B10.D2 background.
Strain-speciﬁc differences between these mice have been
well documented (49, 50) and may have contributed to
subtle differences in phenotypic and mechanistic observations reported. For instance, loss of LAG-3/PD-1 on a B10.D2
background can lead to an increase in IL-17þ cells which was
not seen in mice on a Balb/c background.
Although CTLA-4, PD-1, and LAG-3 are all negative regulators expressed during T-cell activation, high level, dual LAG-3/
PD-1 expression is largely restricted to inﬁltrating TILs. Thus,
LAG-3/PD-1 combinatorial immunotherapy may promote
tumor-speciﬁc responses relative to nonspeciﬁc or self-antigen–speciﬁc immune responses and thus may be less toxic
than CTLA-4 blockade. Given the recent phase 3 results with
anti–CTLA-4 treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma,
showing a clear survival beneﬁt (albeit with notable immune
toxicity; ref. 28), our results suggest that combined blockade of
PD-1 and LAG-3 is a highly promising combinatorial strategy
for the immune-based therapy of cancer.
