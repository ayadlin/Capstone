Abstract
Novel target discovery is warranted to improve treatment in adult T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients. We provide a comprehensive study on
mutations to enhance the understanding of therapeutic targets and studied 81
adult T-ALL patients. NOTCH1 exhibited the highest mutation rate (53%). Mutation
frequencies of FBXW7 (10%), WT1 (10%), JAK3 (12%), PHF6 (11%), and BCL11B
(10%) were in line with previous reports. We identified recurrent alterations in
transcription factors DNM2, and RELN, the WNT pathway associated cadherin FAT1, and
in epigenetic regulators (MLL2, EZH2). Interestingly, we discovered novel recurrent
mutations in the DNA repair complex member HERC1, in NOTCH2, and in the splicing
factor ZRSR2. A frequently affected pathway was the JAK/STAT pathway (18%)
and a significant proportion of T-ALL patients harboured mutations in epigenetic
regulators (33%), both predominantly found in the unfavourable subgroup of early
T-ALL. Importantly, adult T-ALL patients not only showed a highly heterogeneous
mutational spectrum, but also variable subclonal allele frequencies implicated in
therapy resistance and evolution of relapse. In conclusion, we provide novel insights
in genetic alterations of signalling pathways (e.g. druggable by γ-secretase inhibitors,
JAK inhibitors or EZH2 inhibitors), present in over 80% of all adult T-ALL patients,
that could guide novel therapeutic approaches.

Introduction

outcome[1]. While the cure rate in pediatric T-ALL
patients exceeds 70%, a similar rate in adults is only
observed for patients in the favorable risk group of
thymic T-ALL as defined by the expression of CD1a[2,3].

Importantly, ETP-ALL, which recently gained interest
as it represents a subgroup of T-ALL with stem cell and
myeloid characteristics[21,36-38], may serve as model
for the design of novel molecular therapies. Although
the classification of ETP-ALL based on gene expression
and immunophenotype were only partly overlapping[29],
the subgroup of ETP-ALL is already an ideal model for
therapy approaches adapted to its distinct molecular
characteristics. Specifically mutated genes, mainly
affected in ETP-ALL include members of the (PRC2) or
genes reflecting the stem cell and myeloid character of
ETP-ALL like FLT3, DNMT3A or KRAS. This mutation
pattern of ETP-ALL opens up potential options for
targeted therapies[21,22]. This might be of special interest
in a minimal residual disease (MRD) setting as a bridging
therapy to alloSCT.
Whereas a number of putative driver mutations have
been characterized, the spectrum of recurring alterations
in larger cohorts and their relevance in different T-ALL
subgroups remains unexplored. To unravel this spectrum
and to explore potential targets for novel therapeutic
interventions, we performed targeted high throughput
sequencing of 88 candidate genes in 81 T-ALL samples
of adult patients.

Patients within the immature immunophenotypic group
of early T-ALL as well as patients of the mature T-ALL
subtype show a significantly inferior outcome[1].
Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT)
in first complete remission has led to an improved
outcome e.g. in the context of the German Multicenter
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) trials, further
therapeutic improvements are urgently warranted, in
particular for high risk patients. In B-cell precursor (BCP-)
ALL molecularly directed therapies like Rituxumab[4], the
bi-specific antibody Blinatumomab[5], or tyrosine kinase
inhibitors in Ph+-ALL[6] are well established. In contrast,
targeted therapies are not available for T-ALL, with the
exception of Nelarabine[7]. In order to identify targets for
specific treatment strategies, a better understanding of the
molecular background of T-ALL is necessary[8].
Previous to next generation sequencing (NGS),
genetic alterations of leukemic blasts were mainly
examined by cytogenetics to detect chromosomal
rearrangements. In addition, immunophenotypic
characterization, gene expression arrays, and copy
number alterations were also used to categorize T-ALL[9].
Variations on a single nucleotide level had only been
described for very few genes. One of the most relevant
and frequent alterations are mutations of NOTCH1 gene
occurring in about 60% of all T-ALL cases[10-12]. In
addition, mutations of FBXW7, another player in the
NOTCH pathway, as well as mutations of WT1 and PTEN
were previously described[13-18].
Through NGS, molecular classification of T-ALL
has dramatically expanded. Recurrent mutations
in T-ALL affect genes involved in transcriptional
processes (BCL11B[19], RUNX1[20], GATA3[21]),
epigenetic regulation (DNMT3A[20,22], members of
polycomb repressor complex (PRC2)[21]), JAK/STAT
signalling[21,23-25] (JAK1/2/3, IL7R), ribosomal
processes (RPL10, RPL5)[25], and various other functions
(e.g. WT1[26], CNOT3[25], PHF[27], MEF2C[28,29],
LEF1[30]). These data, predominantly derived from
pediatric T-ALL, suggest a highly heterogeneous and
complex molecular background of T-ALL. While some
of these alterations imply prognostic significance,
comprehensive studies with focus on therapeutic targets
in larger series of adult T-ALL patients are missing. This
is of particular importance as most cancer genes occur at
intermediate frequencies of 2-20% or even lower[31].
Thus far, molecular subgroups in T-ALL were
defined mainly based on gene expression profile
(GEP)[28,32,33] or immunophenotype[2,3]. Both
classifications, based on GEP or immunophenotype
reflect the physiological T-cell stage, in which growth
arrest and malignant transformation occured[34]. The
gene signature of the early T-cell precursor (ETP)ALL reflects the expression profile of early thymocyte
progenitors in the double negative (DN)1 stage and ETPALL also shows a distinct immunophenotype[35,36].

Results
Single nucleotide variations and short indels in
adult T-ALL
We obtained an average of 1.2 million reads for each
sample resulting in an average coverage of 120 reads for
the target region. Eighty percent of the targeted region
was covered with a minimum of 20 reads (Supplementary
Table S1). After exclusion of polymorphisms annotated
in dbSNP135, 473 single nucleotide variations (SNVs)
and short indels were identified with a minimum call of
20 reads, 313 of those resulted in changes in the coding
sequence of the target region. On average, three (3.2)
genes per patient were mutated, and 64 (73%) of the 88
genes were mutated in at least one patient (Supplementary
Table S2). We identified three patients without any SNVs
in the selected genes. One patient showed an aberrantly
high rate of SNVs with 21/88 genes being mutated
(Supplementary Table S3). The number of mutations in
the selected genes did not correlate with the patients’ age.

Mutational spectrum of candidate genes in T-ALL
In total, fifteen of the 88 investigated genes were
mutated in more than 5% of patients with nine genes
showing a mutation frequency of ≥10%. As expected, the
highest mutation rate with 53% was found for NOTCH1.

(12%), and BCL11B (10%) were in the range of previously
reported frequencies[21,26,39,40]. Recently identified
recurrent alterations in DNM2 (17%), PHF6 (11%),
DNMT3A (5%) or RELN (5%) were confirmed in this
larger cohort of adult T-ALL patients[20,21,27] (Table 1).
Interestingly, genes involved in epigenetic functions such
as TET2 (5%), SUZ12 (5%), EP300 (5%) as well as genes
that possess transcriptional activity like RUNX1 (9%),
PTEN (8%), CBL (5%), or BCOR (4%) were mutated in
the range of 5-10% of our T-ALL patients.

Genes previously linked to ETP-ALL were also
found to be mutated in the remaining non-ETP T-ALL
subgroups including recurring mutations in the histone
methyl-transferase MLL2 (11%), frequently mutated in
B-cell lymphomas[41-43]. Like in B-cell lymphoma,
MLL2 mutations were distributed over the entire gene
locus without pointing towards a hot-spot region
(Supplementary Figure S1). Similarly, the protocadherins
FAT1 (15%) and FAT3 (12%) were altered not only in early
T-ALL (FAT1 23%, FAT3 15%), but were also recurrently

mutated - though in a lower frequency - in thymic T-ALL
(FAT1 15%, FAT3 13%; Table 1).
Mutation frequencies for distinct genes appeared to
significantly different across T-ALL subgroups (Figure 1a).
This was most remarkable for members of the NOTCH
pathway: NOTCH1 showed a higher frequency in thymic
(67.5%) compared to early T-ALL (38.4%, P=0.02).
Consistent with this mature immunophenotype, NOTCH1
mutation status was significantly linked to a clonal
TCR rearrangement (64% clonal TCR rearrangement in
NOTCH1mut vs. 36% in NOTCH1wt, P=0.01). FBXW7
mutations, similar to NOTCH1 mutations, occurred
exclusively in the subgroup of thymic T-ALL (Table 2).

Additional mutations exclusively found in the subgroup
of thymic T-ALL included BCL11B, TET2, MTOR, BCOR,
and ZSRS2. In contrast, genes of the JAK/STAT pathway
(JAK1, JAK3) and the PRC2 complex (EZH2, SUZ12) as
well as the transcription factors ETV6 and RUNX1 were
predominantly mutated in the immature T-ALL subgroup
(Figure 1a).
In addition, we found novel mutations in genes
which, to our knowledge, have not yet been reported in
T-ALL. Among these HERC1, functionally involved in
DNA repair, was among the most frequently mutated
genes. Other recurrently affected genes included the
splicing gene ZRSR2, or PRKCZ, a gene also involved in

Interestingly, over 35% of our T-ALL patients
carried lesions in epigenetic modulators. Whereas DNA
methylation modifiers (like DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1,
IDH2) were affected in 9% of all cases, histone modifiers
were even more frequently altered, including members of
the PRC such as SUZ12, EZH2, or EP300 and the histone
methyltransferases MLL2 and WHSC1 (28%, Figure 2).
Interestingly, chromatin modifying genes were slightly
more frequently mutated in early compared to thymic
T-ALL (42% vs. 32%, n.s.; Figure 1B).
The JAK/STAT pathway is of particular interest
for the design of targeted therapies with the emergence
of JAK inhibitors. Mutations in JAK1, JAK2, JAK3,
IL7R occurred in 19% of all T-ALL patients, but these
preferentially occurred in immature, high risk T-ALL
cases. Among those, JAK3 mutations were frequent (14%)
and preferentially found in the early (19%) and mature
(20%) subgroups compared to thymic T-ALL (8%, n.s.,
Table 1, Figure 1 and 2).
Another pathway of interest is the WNT pathway
with a high rate of mutations in FAT1 and FAT3, which
is frequently altered in the immature T-ALL subgroups
(Figure 2). The mutation frequency of LEF1, a main
player in the WNT pathway, was unexpectedly low (1%),
which may be due to the fact that larger deletions could be
missed with our NGS approach.
Spliceosome mutations, described for myeloid and
mature lymphoid malignancies, were present only in a
minority (7.4%) of T-ALL (Figure 1B). Overall, pathways
with a potential targeted treatment option were affected in

DNA repair (Supplementary Table S3).
Overall, there was no obvious association between
the mutation status of different genes. Some of the genes
with low mutation rates occurred exclusively, including
genes with redundant functions like e.g. the histone
methyltransferases, WHSC1 and MLL2. WHSC1 (also
known as NSD2 or MMSET2) is associated with the
prognostic unfavourable t(4;14) subgroup in multiple
myeloma[44] and only very recently described in
T-ALL[45,46]. We found WHSC1 to be mutated in 6%
of the patients in our cohort. When combining WHSC1
and MLL2 mutated cases, 17% of all patients revealed
alterations of histone methyltransferase genes.

Affected pathways and association with T-ALL
subgroups
To address the complexity of this heterogeneous
mutational spectrum, we focused on pathways with
potential targets. In this study, the NOTCH pathway
was affected in about 60% of all T-ALL patients (Figure
1B), including mutations in NOTCH1 and FBXW7
as well as in NOTCH2, NOTCH3, HES1, JAG1, and
JAG2 (Supplementary Table S3). Mutations involving
the NOTCH pathway were predominant in the thymic
subgroup (75%) as compared to the early T-ALL (33%,
P=0.004) subgroup. The spectrum of additional mutations
between NOTCH1 mutated and NOTCH1 wildtype
patients was not significantly different.

pathway, JAK/STAT pathway, WNT pathway, DNA

and MAPK pathway (Figure 2).

(VAFs) of all SNVs. In our cohort, T-ALL samples showed
a wide spectrum of VAFs. For a founding clone, VAFs
would be expected to be 44% (+/-7%)[47]. Within this
T-ALL cohort, samples differed not only in the number
of mutated genes, but also in range of VAFs for targeted
genes.
The number of mutated genes varied widely across
different patients (0-21/patient). The group of patients
(n=13) with more than five mutated genes included cases
with the majority of mutated genes linked to the founding
clone. However, three cases had only one gene with VAFs

Variable allele frequencies suggest subclonal
mutations
To identify mutations that may originate from the
founding clone, we analysed the variant allele frequencies

zone displays the expected range for a VAF in the founding clone.

of greater than 40% and the VAFs of the remaining genes
were below 30%, pointing towards a subclonal structure
of the leukemia. In patients with three or more mutated
genes (n=36), we found at least one gene with VAFs in the
range of a founding clone. On the other hand, we found
16 (18%) samples without any alteration with a VAF in
the range of a founding clone (Figure 3A). These were all
patients with two or less mutated genes and it is likely that
the driver mutation was missed due to the gene selection.
The ideal target for an individualized treatment
approach would be a driver mutation with a VAF in
a founding clone. Although some of the genes with a
mutation rate over 5% had predominantly VAFs over
40%, e.g. NOTCH1 or FAT1, none of those could be
exclusively assigned as founding clone. Interestingly,
NOTCH1 regarded as a prominent driver in T-ALL was
found mutated on a subclonal level in 16 patients (37%
of all NOTCH1 mutated patients). Furthermore, in three
patients NOTCH1 showed at least two different alterations
(Supplementary Figure S1). In all these cases one mutation
had a VAF in the range of a founding clone, but the second
mutation appeared to be present only within a subclone
with a VAF below 30%.
Most of the recurrently mutated genes could be
assigned to a founding clone in at least one patient. Some
genes only showed low VAFs like e.g. ABL1, FLT3,
NRAS or SUZ12 and thus are presumably later events in
leukemogenesis. All of these genes were mutated in only
three or less T-ALL patients in our cohort. Among the
genes with a VAF higher than 50%, PHF6, BCOR, and
ZRSR2 are located on the X chromosome (Figure 3B).
Taken together, the spectrum of VAFs in T-ALL shows
a highly heterogeneous pattern with none of the frequent
(>10%) lesions being exclusively present in the founding
clone.

This approach would allow us to identify also recurrent
candidate genes altered in lower frequencies[31]. We were
able to confirm a broad spectrum of mutations and this
provides confidence that the detection of genetic lesions is
accurately displayed in sequencing libraries and targeted
NGS.
Among the most obvious mutations, we found
genetic alterations in over 50% of the patients for
NOTCH1, one of the best described events in T-ALL. All
other reported recurrent mutations (among others PTEN,
PHF6, BCL11B, or WT1) occurred in less than 20% of
adult T-ALL patients[33]. The frequency of NOTCH1
mutations as well as mutation rates for other well
established genes like WT1, FBXW7, or BCL11B were in
the range of previously reported incidences[33]. Another
frequent alteration, genomic deletion of CDKN2A, was,
however, not covered by our approach.
We also confirmed recurrent mutations in DNM2,
PHF6, PTEN, JAK3, and RUNX1, which were only very
recently discovered. The cadherins FAT1 and FAT3,
mutated in ETP-ALL[22], have not yet been described
in non-ETP T-ALL of adults and were identified by our
approach to be recurrently mutated across all subgroups
of adult T-ALL. FAT1 and its mutational inactivation have
been linked to activation of the WNT pathway in solid
tumors and to chemoresistance in chronic lymphocytic
leukemia[48,49] and could serve as an attractive
therapeutic target.
Furthermore, we found a high rate of mutations in
MLL2, a histone methyltransferase, frequently mutated in
various types of B-cell lymphomas[41-43]. Like in B-cell
lymphomas, MLL2 mutations were distributed over the
entire gene without any obvious hot-spot region[41,50].
Interestingly, another histone methyltransferase, WHSC1
(also known as MMSET/NSD2), was recurrently mutated
in T-ALL and, although in a small number of patients,
mutually exclusive within MLL2. WHSC1, associated
with the so called Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome[51], was
only very recently found to be mutated in pediatric ALL,
particularly in t(12;21) ETV6-RUNX1 ALL[45,46],
as well as in mantle cell lymphoma[42]. These results
together with mutations in the PRC2 complex and in genes
involved in DNA methylation unravel a yet unreported
high frequency (of over 25%) of alterations in epigenetic
regulators in adult T-ALL. This is in line with other
hematologic malignancies like acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or diffuse large
cell lymphoma[41,52,53]. These findings suggest that a
very tight regulation of chromatin remodelling, especially
for methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3, is required in
physiological cell development and correct hematopoietic
differentiation.
Interestingly, patients with an immature T-ALL
immunophenotype showed a particular high frequency for
mutations in epigenetic regulators and thus emphasize the
similarity with myeloid malignancies. This is especially

Discussion
Although risk stratification and subsequent therapy
intensification have led to an improved outcome in adult
T-ALL, the cure rate of approximately 50% remains
unsatisfactory. Unlike in BCP-ALL with established
targeted therapies (Rituximab, TKI, potentially
Blinatumomab), no targeted therapy is yet available in
T-ALL. Therefore, molecular targets and implementation
of individualized treatment options are sorely needed.
In our study, we investigated the mutational
spectrum of a large adult T-ALL cohort to identify
potential molecular targets. As previously reported,
T-ALL shows, despite of common features regarding
immunophenotype or gene expression, a highly
heterogeneous mutational background[21,25]. However,
most of the previously published data are generated in
pediatric T-ALL patients. Here, we have investigated
in an original and comprehensive study, a large set of
candidate genes in a large cohort of adult T-ALL patients.

striking in the subgroup of ETP-ALL as already described
by Zhang and colleagues[21]. We were unable to confirm
the high mutation rate in the PRC2 members described
for pediatric patients, but we frequently found mutations
in regulators of DNA methylation, possibly related to
preexisting lesions in hematopoietic progenitors in the
elderly[22,54]. Taken together, the high frequency of
mutations in epigenetic regulators offers new insights and
potential therapeutic applications e.g. of EZH2 inhibitors,
histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or demethylating
agents, which should be explored in clinical studies.
Another promising pathway for targeted therapies
is the JAK/STAT pathway with frequent JAK3 mutations
(13%). This rate is higher than the reported frequency in
pediatric ALL patients[21]. For JAK1, varying mutation
rates (4-18%) have been published[24,55]; in our cohort
we found 4% of JAK1 mutations. In total, 18% of all
our adult T-ALL patients carried alterations in the JAK/
STAT pathway, predominantly in high-risk patients with
an immature immunophenotype that might benefit from
the application of molecular directed therapies, including
JAK inhibitors[56].
Interestingly, mutations in the spliceosome, which
are frequently found in MDS and in subgroups of
AML[52,53], were virtually absent in T-ALL patients
throughout all subgroups. Therefore, other elementary
cellular processes might play a role in T-ALL. In a recent
study, alterations in posttranslational mechanisms were
suggested[25]. Unfortunately, these findings were reported
after the design of our study and genes of interest, like
RPL5, RPL10, or CNOT3, were not included in our gene
panel.
In contrast to the work of de Keersmaecker
and colleagues, we did not observe an age dependent
distribution of mutation frequencies[25]. However this is
likely due to our study design focused on candidate genes
potentially enriched for driver mutations. The difference
in the mutation frequencies in unbiased whole exome
approaches and the frequencies in selected gene panels
raises the question, whether the higher rate of mutations
in prima vista not T-ALL associated genes simply reflects
the altered hematopoiesis in elderly or possesses itself a
leukemogenic potential[57-59].
NGS techniques are becoming widely available
and are about to guide treatment decisions. This offers
the opportunity not only to identify targets but also to
unravel the spectrum of subclonal architecture that likely
affects the response to targeted therapies. In addition, the
mutational spectrum of leukemic cell changes during the
progression of the disease and relapses are frequently
harbored in preexisting subclones[47,57]. It has been
shown that specific mutations, which are only present in
a minor subclone at diagnosis, could lead to relapse due
to chemotherapy resistance[60,61]. Therefore, the sole
assessment of mutated genes might insufficient to select
an optimal targeted therapy and determination of mutation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

frequency might be necessary to predict responses and
the risk of relapse. This additional level of complexity
in describing mutational landscapes for each individual
patient is explored in our study and emphasizes that
reported drivers not only occurred in the founding clone,
but also in subclones. Thus, the sole restriction to gene
panel assays for diagnostic purposes will likely not be
sufficient to capture the wide clonal diversity and thus will
likely miss mutations in the founding clone and even more
in the subclones[47].
Adult T-ALL reveals a highly heterogeneous and
individual spectrum of candidate gene mutations. Here,
we provide an original and comprehensive overview
of recurring mutations that unravel altered pathways
enriched in specific leukemic subgroups. In addition, we
identified novel candidate genes with potential therapeutic
implications (FAT1, MLL2, HERC1). These mutations
have to be further validated in larger patient cohorts
accompanied by functional assays regarding their value
as potential therapeutic targets. The identification of
individual lesions in daily clinical routine, their clonal
evolution, and the incorporation of highly individualized
therapies in study trials will be a future challenge.

Patients and Methods
Patients and treatment
We investigated bone marrow samples from
81 adult T-ALL patients with material sent to the
reference laboratory of the GMALL study group and
with sufficient genomic DNA quality, quantity and
blast count (>80%) to perform NGS (Supplementary
Table S4). Immunophenotyping of fresh samples was
centrally performed in the GMALL reference laboratory
at the Charité, University Hospital Berlin, Germany.
Immunophenotyping was carried out as previously
described[62,63]. T-lineage leukemia was subclassified
into pre-T-ALL or early T-ALL (cyCD3+, CD7+, CD5+/−,
CD2−, sCD3−, CD4−/+, CD8−/+, CD1a− or cyCD3+,
CD7+, CD5−, CD2+, sCD3−, CD4−, CD8−, CD1a−),
thymic T-ALL (cyCD3+, CD7+, CD5+/−, CD2+/−,
sCD3+/−, CD4+, CD8+, CD1a+), and mature T-ALL
(cyCD3+, CD7+, CD5+, CD2+, sCD3+/−, CD4+/−,
CD8+/−, CD1a−). The immature subtypes of pre-T-ALL
and early T-ALL are merged to a combined early T-ALL
group. In addition, patients were classified to have an
ETP-ALL within early T-ALL according to the criteria
originally used by Couston-Smith and colleagues[36].
In detail, all samples were positive for cyCD3 and
CD7, with absence of CD1a and CD8 (less than 5% of
all lymphoblasts were positive), and weak expression of
CD5 (i.e. less than 75% of all lymphoblasts were positive).
Furthermore, the immunophenotype was characterized by

We constructed libraries from 3 µg of genomic
DNA, which were labeled by barcode indices (length:
6 bp). Customized biotinylated RNA oligo pools
(SureSelect, Agilent) were used to hybridize the target
regions comprising the 88 selected genes. We performed
76-bp paired-end sequencing on an Illumina Genome
Analyzer IIx platform. Reads were mapped to NCBI hg19
RefSeq. For a variant call, we required at least a read
depth of 30, an allele frequency of 20% and an average
base calling quality of Q13. Polymorphisms annotated in
dbSNP 135 were excluded (Supplementary Figure S2).

Statistical analyses
Differences in the clinical characteristics were tested
by the Pearson χ2 test resp. Fisher test. Differences in the
mutation rate were analyzed by the Pearson χ2 test. For
all tests a P-value < 0.05 (two-sided) was considered to
indicate a significant difference. All calculations were
performed using the SPSS software version 17 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism® software
version 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

the expression (i.e. more than 25% of the lymphoblasts
positive) of at least one myeloid or stem cell marker
(CD13, CD33, CD65, CD117, CD34, HLA-DR).

Patients’ characteristics

Acknowledgements

Of the 81 adult T-ALL patients examined in
this study, 40 patients showed an immunophenotype
of thymic T-ALL, 15 of mature T-ALL and 26 of early
T-ALL, and amongst the latter group, 20 had an ETP-ALL
immunophenotype. The median age was 35 years (range
17-73) and 83% of the patients were male. The median
white blood cell count (WBC) at diagnosis was 41.9/nL
(range 0.8-332; Table 2). For all 81 samples the TCR
rearrangement status was available[64].

Selection of candidate genes

References

The 88 genes selected for targeting sequencing
are listed in the supplement (Supplementary Table S2).
We selected genes known to be recurrently mutated in
T-ALL, but also other genes, frequently mutated in BCPALL, (AML), and (MDS) were incorporated into the
analysis[21,25,52,65]. Furthermore, genes with functions
in epigenetic regulations, like members of the (PRC2)
or in the splicing machinery, were included. Also, we
selected candidate genes, based on our analysis of five
exomes of adult ETP-ALL[22]. The targeted region of
the 88 genes covered 1427 coding exons and 311 Kb of
sequence (Supplementary Table S2).
