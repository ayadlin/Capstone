BACKGROUND: Oral mucositis (OM) is a significant toxicity of induction chemotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer
(LAHNC). The safety and tolerability of AG013, an oral rinse containing recombinant Lactococcus lactis secreting mucosal protectant
human trefoil factor 1 (hTFF1), was evaluated in a phase 1b study in LAHNC subjects who received induction with cisplatin, 5fluorouracil, with or without docetaxel. Preliminary efficacy data were also obtained. METHODS: A total of 25 of 52 LAHNC subjects
who were followed during induction cycle 1 developed ulcerative oral mucositis (UOM; World Health Organization grade > 2) and
were randomized to AG013:placebo (5:2 ratio) for cycle 2. Dosing schedules of 1, 3, or 6 times daily were evaluated (2 3 1011, 6 3 1011,
and 1.2 3 1012 colony forming units per day, respectively). OM was evaluated daily from cycle 2, day 1 through 14, using World Health
Organization criteria. Pharmacokinetic assessment was also conducted. RESULTS: AG013 bacteria were not detected in blood. Oral
live AG013 bacterial and hTFF1 levels in saliva and oral mucosa were equivalent among treatment groups. The most frequently occurring adverse events were nausea, oral pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and mucosal inflammation. Only 12% (3 of 25 adverse events), mainly
nausea, were attributed to the investigational medicinal product: AG013 or placebo. Efficacy analysis showed a 35% reduction in percentage of days with UOM in AG013-subjects versus placebo. All placebo subjects experienced  2 days of UOM, whereas 29% of
AG013 subjects had UOM for 0 or 1 day. AG013 use resulted in fewer unscheduled office and emergency room visits. No differences
were noted in mouth and throat soreness, opioid use, or gastrostomy tube placement. CONCLUSIONS: AG013 was safe and well tolC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Oral mucositis (OM) is a painful, common, and potentially debilitating toxicity of induction chemotherapy with TPF
(docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) or PF (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) and/or radiation therapy with limited treatment
options.1-3 It is associated with increased analgesic and antibiotic use, febrile days, need for parenteral nutrition, length of
hospital stay, unplanned and emergency room visits, and total charges, thus negatively impacting on health and economic
outcomes.1 Palifermin is the only approved agent for OM prevention with limited benefit.4
The trefoil factor family (TFF) is composed of 3 peptides, TFF1 (pS2), TFF2 (spasmolytic peptide), and TFF3 (intestinal trefoil factor), that have wound-healing properties. TFF peptide expression is pronounced in mucus-secreting cells
of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and are rapidly upregulated and secreted in response to GI injury.5,6 Several mechanisms
of wound healing and tissue protection have been suggested including the binding of TFF to mucins to catalyze the formation of high-viscosity stable gel complexes; formation of a protective barrier (ie, restitution); the inhibition of apoptosis
and prevention of anoikis (cell death induced by anchorage independence) during the cell migration process.7 TFF1 and
TFF3 are secreted by human salivary glands and act as a barrier against bacteria and noxious environmental agents.8

AG013 for Oral Mucositis/Limaye et al

TFF has been shown to mitigate mucosal injury
induced by certain chemotherapies (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) in preclinical and clinical settings. Intestinal
TFF-deficient mice were more susceptible to CT/RTmediated injury.9,10 Contrastingly, topical administration
in mice of oral recombinant human TFF3 (rhTFF3)
reduced the severity of both CT (methotrexate)-induced
and CT/RT-induced mucositis.9 A phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of rhTFF3 oral spray to prevent
5-fluorouracil-associated OM in colorectal cancer patients
demonstrated that hTTF3 effectively reduced the frequency of World Health Organization (WHO) grade > 2
OM in a dose-dependent manner compared with placebo
(WHO scores, P < .01).10
Current OM-directed formulations (rinse or spray)
require frequent mucosal exposure of large amounts of
protein to demonstrate efficacy. Both the cost and potential safety issues associated with the use of the high levels
of protein or hTTF3 led to the development of an alternative delivery method known as ActoBiotics. ActoBiotics is
the method of local synthesis and delivery of therapeutic
proteins by viable, genetically modified Lactococcus lactis
bacteria using the TopAct platform.11-13 The TopAct
platform offers an alternative for large-scale purification
of proteins and peptides, and enables delivery of biopharmaceuticals directly to the intestinal mucosa. Because the
production process of the freeze-dried L. lactis bacteria is
very straightforward and the downstream processing only
consists of washing the biomass (instead of expensive purification as for classic biologicals), the production costs of
ActoBiotics is only a fraction of the classic biologicals (eg,
monoclonal antibody or purified protein).
AG013, an ActoBiotic, is an oral rinse composed of
a recombinant L. lactis strain engineered to secrete the
mucosal protectant hTFF1. It is deficient in the gene
encoding thymidylate synthase, and thus is unable to replicate. AG013 allows continuous release of hTFF1 at the
site of the targeted oral mucosa, potentially enhancing efficacy. Topical application of AG013 improved the severity and course of radiation-induced OM in an established
hamster model.14 Pharmacokinetic (PK) experiments performed in hamsters demonstrated that AG013 remained
at the site of the oral mucosal lesions secreting hTFF1 up
to 4 hours after oral rinsing. No adverse impact of AG013
was seen in neutropenic mucositis-bearing animals.14
Here, we report the results of a phase 1b, multicenter,
single blinded, placebo-controlled, sequential dose escalation study of AG013 in newly diagnosed locally advanced
head and neck cancer (LAHNC) subjects undergoing
induction with TPF or PF.2,3,15 Induction chemotherapy

remains a standard of care in the management of LAHNC
and is known to cause more than 20% of OM cases (range,
4.6% to 27%), which adds significantly to the morbidity
associated with these regimens.2,3,15 We studied the effects
of AG013 on this population of subjects due to the high
rates of OM associated with these regimens.
The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and
tolerability of 3 different daily dose levels of orally applied
AG013. The secondary objective was to evaluate the PK.
An exploratory efficacy objective evaluated differences in
the extent and/or severity of OM within 3 different daily
dose levels of AG013 or placebo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects

Eligible subjects had newly diagnosed, pathologically confirmed squamous cell LAHNC scheduled to receive at
least 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy with TPF or
PF.2,3 Exclusion criteria included: prior radiation to head
and neck, significant active infectious disease, alcohol
abuse, immunosuppression, hepatitis B/C infection, or
inability to complete subject diary.
A minimum of 7 subjects (5 treatment, 2 placebo)
were to be treated at each of the 3 dose levels of the investigational medicinal product (IMP): either AG013 or placebo: 15 mL at 1, 3, and 6 times daily (Fig. 1). The
biostatistics division of the Clinical Supply Unit did the
subject randomization and conveyed the results to the
Clinical Research Organization. The AG013 mouth rinse
contained 2.0 3 1011 colony-forming units (CFU)/15
mL, resulting in a total dose of 2.0 3 1011, 6.0 3 1011,
and 1.2 3 1012 CFU/day for the 3 dose levels, respectively. A slightly higher dose was proposed than was
observed in the hamster OM model. A minimum dose
was not considered, given the short-term exposure and the
relative safety seen with AG013 and in another treatment
utilizing this technology.16
Subjects assigned to the placebo group received a
placebo rinse matched for appearance and taste. Each
dose was prepared by mixing 3 different components:
AG013 drug product or placebo, liquid auxiliary components, and solid auxiliary components. Subjects received
designated number of oral rinse packages, storage and
preparation instructions, and a detailed dosing schedule.
The study was conducted in full compliance with
the principles of Declaration of Helsinki, International
Conference on Harmonization guidelines Good Clinical
Practice (GCP) E6,17 and under United States investigational new drug regulations. The study was reviewed and

proceeded to the active treatment phase. A baseline
WHO-OM score of 0 was required before subjects started
the active phase. OM was evaluated daily from CT cycle
2, days 1 through 14, using WHO criteria. During the
active treatment phase, subjects received the IMP during
the first 14 days of cycle 2. The study subjects were
unaware of the study arm they were on.

Study Design

The study was conducted in 4 phases: screening, enrichment, active treatment, and long-term follow-up. Subjects
who met eligibility criteria in screening proceeded to the
enrichment phase, received CT cycle 1, and were monitored daily with Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire
(OMDQ)18 for OM: defined as a subject-reported mouth
or throat soreness  2 instances during this cycle. Subjects

Safety Assessments

Vital signs were measured and complete blood count,
comprehensive metabolic panel, and testing for AG013
bacteria in whole blood were performed at screening,
baseline, weekly during treatment, and at the end of study
(EOS; 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP). Adverse events
(AEs) were graded based on the NCI Common

study, and after the clinical database was cleaned, quality
checked, and frozen.
RESULTS
Subjects

The study was not powered for efficacy analysis. Exploratory efficacy data were however obtained. Trained study
staff graded OM, using WHO criteria, from CT cycle 2,
days 1 through 14. If WHO grade  2 mucositis persisted
at day 14, evaluations continued until OM  grade 1. A
complete oral assessment was conducted for subjects who
withdrew prior to study completion. Efficacy endpoints
included the incidence and duration of severe or ulcerative
OM (UOM, WHO Grade > 2), the percent of subjects
with mouth or throat soreness, incidence and duration of
opioid use, gastrostomy tube feeding, and unplanned
office or emergency room visits and hospitalizations.

Between November 2009 and September 2011, 52 subjects
were screened for eligibility at 6 US sites. Of 49 subjects
who met eligibility criteria and participated in the study’s
enrichment phase, 25 subjects developed UOM and participated in the active phase. All 25 subjects enrolled in the
active phase of the study received at least 1 dose of IMP and
were included in the safety analysis. Twenty-two subjects
completed the study (Fig. 1). Only 19 of 25 (14 subjects
were on AG013 treatment and 5 subjects were on placebo)
were included in the efficacy analysis. Six subjects were
excluded from the efficacy analysis (per-protocol population): 2 of 6 subjects withdrew consent (1 on placebo 63/
day and 1 on AG013 33/day); 4 of 6 subjects were
excluded due to noncompliance (defined as inability to
comply with the schedule or dose of IMP or with the assessment of oral mucositis): 2 on placebo 63/day, 1 on AG013
63/day, and 1 on AG013 33/day.
Subject demographics are presented in Table 1. The
median age was 54 years, 76% were male, and 72% were
white; 52% of subjects had an oropharynx primary tumor,
52% were stage IVA and 36% IVB. Twenty-four subjects
received TPF and 1 received PF. Eleven subjects received
TPF per TAX 324 regimen2 and 13 subjects per TAX 323
regimen.3 Two subjects receiving TPF per the TAX 324
regimen, on the placebo arm, had 20% dose reductions in
cycle 2.

Statistical Methods

Tolerability and Safety

Descriptive statistical methods were used to summarize the
data, including number of subjects (N), mean, median,
standard deviation, standard error of the mean, minimum,
and maximum for continuous data, and frequencies and
percentages for categorical data. Data were summarized by
treatment groups. Placebo subjects from the 3 groups were
combined for analysis. Missing and incomplete dates were
imputed as described in the statistical analysis plan. No
other missing data were imputed. Baseline was defined as
the last nonmissing value obtained prior to the first dose of
IMP. Study days were defined relative to baseline (day 1).
All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS software,
version 9.1.3, or higher. Results were verified using independent programming. The lead statistician verified all
documents to ensure accuracy of analyses. The primary
analysis was conducted after the last subject completed 30
days following the last dose of IMP or discontinued the

Treatment compliance was highest for the once-daily dosing group (median 100%), followed by 33/day (94%)
and placebo (82%), and lowest for the 63/day dosing
group (median, 61.9%). The intensity of 63/day dosing
in a population of patients undergoing intense treatment
and issues with taste and smell related to the liquid auxiliary components were thought to contribute to the
impaired tolerance in this group. Median duration of exposure was 14 days for each group. Tolerability scores
(Table 2) were in the mid-range for taste; low for consistency and variable for smell and were similar between placebo and AG013.
The AE profile of AG013 was similar to that of placebo (Table 3). Most subjects (24 of 25, 96%) experienced at least 1 AE. The most frequently occurring AEs
were nausea (11 of 25, 44%), oral pain (10 of 25, 40%),
fatigue (9 of 25, 36%), diarrhea (6 of 25, 24%), and

The tolerability of the IMP (taste, consistency, and smell)
was rated daily in a subject diary on a scale from 0 (no
issues) to 10 (serious issues).
Pharmacokinetic Analysis

The PK endpoints were 1) oral mucosal and salivary levels
of AG013 bacterial count, 2) oral mucosal and salivary levels of hTFF1, and 3) measurable serum levels of hTFF1.
Mucosal smears and saliva and serum samples were collected on day 1 before dose, days 1, 7, and 14 at 90 minutes
after dose and EOS. Additional mucosal samples were collected immediately after dosing on days 1, 7, and 14.

mucosal inflammation (5 of 25, 20%). Twelve percent (3
of 25) of AEs were categorized as attributed to IMP (Table
3). No deaths or discontinuations due to AEs occurred,
and no subjects discontinued IMP due to an AE. Four
subjects experienced severe AEs (none attributed to IMP)
during the active treatment phase and recovered within 2
days: 2 febrile neutropenia; 1 had nausea, abdominal
pain, dehydration; and 1 had pyrexia. No subjects developed sepsis from AG013 bacteria. The frequency and severity of laboratory and vital signs abnormalities were
similar between the placebo and active treatment groups.
AG013 bacteria were not detected in blood from any subjects on active treatment.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis

The PK profiles for AG013 and hTFF1 are shown in
Table 4. For subjects who received active treatment, oral
4272

mucosal, and saliva levels of live AG013 bacteria were
detected immediately after rinsing as well as at 90 minutes
on days 1, 7, and 14. No bacteria could be detected at the
EOS visit. The number of live AG013 bacteria recovered
decreased by 90 minutes after dosing. Overall, oral bacterial levels were equivalent on days 1, 7, and 14 in all active
treatment groups. The levels of hTFF1 at the oral mucosa,
in saliva, and in serum were not significantly different
between the treatment groups at all time points measured.
Efficacy

Most subjects experienced UOM (mean duration of 7
days) during the active treatment phase. Subjects who
received AG013 had 35% decrease in mean percentage of
days with UOM as compared to placebo (Fig. 2). Furthermore, 29% subjects who received AG013 had 0 or 1 day
of UOM, whereas all placebo subjects experienced at least

DISCUSSION
We report the results of a safety and tolerability study of
AG013, a novel oral rinse containing a L. lactis strain engineered to secrete the mucosal protectant hTFF1. We studied
this application in LAHNC subjects being treated with
induction-based therapy, due to high rate of OM associated
with induction chemotherapy in this patient population. Further studies are being designed with AG013 in the LAHNC
subjects being treated with definitive chemoradiation.

relevant infections. Lactococcus lactis, which is contained
in dairy products, is considered a nonpathologic bacterium. No cases of sepsis in neutropenic subjects with L.
lactis have been reported. One of the main safety outcomes for this study was the detection of AG013 bacteria
in blood. No positive blood cultures were noted and there
was no evidence of significant laboratory abnormalities attributable to AG013. Finally, adverse events related to the
IMP were mild and transient.
One limitation of our study was the nonhomogeneous
induction chemotherapy regimens used. Although the study
used TPF as the main induction regimen, one subject received
PF alone. Of the TPF group, 2 different sets of doses were
used based on the FDA-approved regimens from the
TAX 324 and TAX 323 studies. Both of these regimens are
known to cause oral mucositis as they both use continuous
infusion of 5-fluorouracil. These variations in the induction
regimen and dosing may have affected the results of our study.
Most subjects tolerated AG013 well and compliance
was high for the once and thrice daily dose levels. As
expected, the intensity of 63/day-dosing impaired compliance. Issues with taste and smell related to the liquid
auxiliary components further contributed and is being
addressed for future clinical trials.
Oral AG013 bacterial levels were high immediately
after dosing, decreased 90 minutes post-dose, and were
equivalent for the 3 active treatment groups. Bacterial
accumulation was not detected in these groups. The
AG013 bacterial levels were undetectable 2 weeks after
the last dose of IMP.
No dose frequency-related differences in hTFF1 levels could be detected in saliva or oral mucosa among the
4274

treatment groups or placebo. This may have been as a
result of limitations of the sampling method used. A subsequent PK study (manuscript in preparation) was performed in healthy volunteers to address this question.19 In
this PK study, sampling occurred at multiple time points
over a total of 24 hours after rinsing with AG013, allowing for the calculation of an integrated total exposure over
24 hours (area-under-the-curve). Assessment of bacterial
and hTFF1 levels on the oral mucosa and in saliva demonstrated prolonged exposure to bacteria and measurable
differences in hTFF1 levels pre-dosing versus post-dosing.
The latter is contrary to our findings in this phase 1b study
and can be explained by the use of an improved sampling
procedure allowing for correction of volume recovered
and the protein content, and by the fact that the assessment at multiple time points versus 2 postdose time
points only, that were used in this phase 1b study.
Subjects who received AG013 had less UOM than
subjects who received placebo. In addition, unscheduled
office and emergency room visits were less frequent in
subjects treated with AG013.
Conclusions

AG013 is an ActoBiotic, a mouth rinse containing a L.
lactis strain genetically engineered to secrete the mucosal
protectant hTFF1. It uses a novel platform of drug delivery that is convenient and cost-effective. Our results demonstrate that AG013 is safe and well tolerated. Nausea was
the commonest side effect observed in 12% of subjects
(both AG013 and placebo) and was thought to be related
to the liquid auxiliary components in both preparations.
The thrice daily dosing appeared to balance the

AG013 for Oral Mucositis/Limaye et al

Figure 2. In terms of efficacy, AG013 led to 35% reduction in
mean percentage of days with ulcerative oral mucositis
(UOM) compared to placebo (PBO) and reduced unplanned
office and emergency room visits. In addition, 29% of subjects who received AG013 had 0 or 1 day of UOM whereas all
placebo subjects experienced at least 2 days of UOM. Abbreviations: QD, once per day; TID, 3 times per day.

considerations of tolerability and efficacy. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that live AG013 bacteria can be
recovered from the oral mucosa. Further pharmacokinetic
studies may help elucidate the survival and protein production curves for AG013 thereby informing us further
on optimal dose and schedule. The preliminary efficacy
data suggest that AG013 may reduce PF/TPF-induced
UOM. Further studies with larger sample size are needed
to validate the efficacy of AG013 in cancer treatment
related mucositis. A phase 2 study is being designed in
LAHNC-subjects receiving definitive chemoradiation to
carry this investigation forward.
