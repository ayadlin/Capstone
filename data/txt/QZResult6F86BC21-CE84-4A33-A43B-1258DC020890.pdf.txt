Abstract
Docetaxel-conjugate nanoparticles, known as Cellax, were synthesized by covalently conjugating docetaxel
and polyethylene glycol to acetylated carboxymethylcellulose via ester linkages, yielding a polymeric
conjugate that self-assembled into 120 nm particles suitable for intravenous administration. In 4T1 and
MDA-MB-231 orthotopic breast tumor models, Cellax therapy reduced a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)
content by 82% and 70%, respectively, whereas native docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel (albumin-paclitaxel
nanoparticle, Abraxane) exerted no signiﬁcant antistromal activity. In Cellax-treated mice, tumor perfusion
was increased by approximately 70-fold (FITC-lectin binding), tumor vascular permeability was enhanced by
more than 30% (dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging), tumor matrix was decreased
by 2.5-fold (immunohistochemistry), and tumor interstitial ﬂuid pressure was suppressed by approximately
3-fold after Cellax therapy compared with the control, native docetaxel, and nab-paclitaxel groups. The
antistromal effect of Cellax treatment corresponded to a signiﬁcantly enhanced antimetastatic effect: lung
nodules were reduced by 7- to 24-fold by Cellax treatment, whereas native docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel
treatments were ineffective. Studies of the 4T1 tumor showed that more than 85% of the Cellax nanoparticles
were delivered to the a-SMAþ stroma. Signiﬁcant tumor stromal depletion occurred within 16 hours (50%
depletion) postinjection, and the a-SMAþ stroma population was almost undetectable (3%) by 1 week. The
4T1 tumor epithelial cell population was not signiﬁcantly reduced in the week after Cellax injection. These
data suggest that Cellax targets tumor stroma and performs more efﬁcaciously than docetaxel and nabpaclitaxel. Cancer Res; 73(15); 4862–71. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a common malignancy and a leading cause
of cancer-related death in women, with mortality largely
attributable to metastatic spread to vital organs such as lung,
liver, and bone (1–3). Advances in drug delivery have potential
to improve therapy, and nanomedicine approaches exhibit
particular promise (4–6). Nanoparticle therapies leverage the
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect: tumor
vasculature is abnormally permeable compared with normal

vasculature, and as a result, nanoparticles can migrate selectively into tumor tissues (4). Nanoparticle therapy can increase
the dose of chemotherapy to tumor tissue, and spare normal
tissue from exposure (7). However, enhancing drug delivery to
the tumor does not necessarily equate to improved bioavailability (8): the drug must be internalized by tumor cells, and
ideally would target cells that are responsible for tumor spread.
The tumor microenvironment is an important contributor
of tumor progression and response to treatment, and therefore
it is important to develop novel therapies that target the
microenvironment. Stromal cells play a vital role in tumor
growth, angiogenesis, and progression (9). For example, ﬁbroblasts are mesenchymal cells normally responsible for the
construction, maintenance, and remodeling of connective
tissues (10), but differentiate to activated cancer-associated
ﬁbroblasts (CAF) when exposed to paracrine signals released
from malignant neoplasms. CAFs constitute the major population of tumor stroma. These cells are characterized by high
a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) expression and excrete a
panel of cytokines that act upon both stromal and tumor cells,
amplifying both cell numbers and enhancing the malignant
phenotype (11). In addition, cytokines stimulate stromal and
tumor cells to excrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMP),
enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) and enable
tumor and stromal cell migration into healthy tissue and into

the systemic circulation (11, 12). Further, these stromal cells
deposit ECM in remodeled tissues, creating a supportive
scaffold for tumor cell proliferation. Therefore, normalization
or elimination of the activated or reactive stromal compartment is a potential approach to cancer control (9). Approaches
to treating the stroma include targeting of VEGF (angiogenesis), MMPs (matrix remodeling), and suppression of the
hedgehog pathway, but clinical success has been limited, as
human tumors tend to become resistant to drugs that block
these pathways (13).
We have recently developed a docetaxel conjugate of polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated acetylcarboxymethyl-cellulose,
known as Cellax. The Cellax polymeric conjugate exhibits a
high drug loading (37 wt% docetaxel), condenses into welldeﬁned approximately 120 nm nanoparticles in saline, releases
drug at a controlled rate in serum (5%/day), and exhibits
good stability in saline at 4 C (> 6 months; refs. 14, 15).
Compared with native docetaxel (the commonly used Tween80
detergent formulation, Taxotere) and nab-paclitaxel (an
albumin nanoformulation of paclitaxel, Abraxane), Cellax
exhibits a 5 and 20 times longer serum half life and 39 and 37
times higher plasma area under the curve (AUC0–240h),
respectively (16). Cellax also shows selective accumulation
in tumors with 5- and 10-fold increased uptake compared
with native docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel, respectively (15,
16). Here, we report the therapeutic effects on the mousemodel breast tumor microenvironment after treatment with
native docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel, and Cellax, and compare
their antistromal and antimetastatic activities. Comparisons
of tumor perfusion and permeability (histology and magnetic resonance imaging), and interstitial ﬂuid pressure
(IFP) are carried out as functional metrics that relate
stromal depletion to efﬁcacy outcomes. We also report the
intratumoral uptake and efﬁcacy of Cellax against a-SMA
stroma and tumor epithelial populations.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) and Taxotere (native docetaxel)
were purchased from the University Health Network pharmacy. Cellax polymer and particles (including DiI-containing particles) were prepared as described previously (14–17).
Additional reagents are described in Supplementary Material. Cellax particle size and zeta potential were measured on
a Malvern NanoZS instrument, and docetaxel content was
measured by a UV method (14, 15). The Cellax particles were
sterile ﬁltered through a 0.22 mm ﬁlter and tested for
endotoxin using the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) turbidity assay and sterility was determined using the agar plate
assay (Nanotechnology Characterization Lab).
Cell culture and animals
Mouse 4T1 and human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Female Balb/c mice (4T1) and female NOD-SCID mice (MDAMB-231) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. All protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the
University Health Network.

Efﬁcacy in orthotopic breast tumor models
Efﬁcacy analysis of Cellax, native docetaxel, and nab-paclitaxel was conducted in 2 orthotopic mouse models of breast
cancer (4T1 and MDA-MB-231). Doses of Cellax, native docetaxel, and nab-paclitaxel were administered at their maximum-tolerated doses (MTD), determined previously (15, 16).
4T1 model: The MTD of Cellax (170 mg docetaxel/kg), native
docetaxel (40 mg/kg), or nab-paclitaxel (170 mg/kg) was
administered via tail vein injection 4 days postinoculation of
the 4T1 cells into the breast fat pads (1  106 cells/injection,
n ¼ 10 mice per group) of female Balb/c mice (i.e., when tumors
reached 5–7 mm in diameter). Six days later, the primary
tumors were resected and ﬁxed for histologic examination,
and on day 13, the mice received a second round of therapy. On
day 20, all mice were sacriﬁced, and lung tissues were harvested
and ﬁxed for histology analysis. MDA-MB-231 model: MDAMB-231 cells were inoculated into the breast fad pad (2  106
cells/injection, n ¼ 10 mice per group) of female NOD-SCID
mice: tumors required 4 weeks to become established and
attain a diameter of 7 to 8 mm. Mice were treated by intravenous injection at the MTD of Cellax (150 mg docetaxel/kg),
native docetaxel (5 mg/kg), or nab-paclitaxel (50 mg/kg), and 1
week later were treated a second time. Primary tumors were
resected 3 weeks after the second treatment. The mice were
monitored for additional 70 days, at which time they were
sacriﬁced, and lungs were harvested and ﬁxed for histologic
analysis.
Before resection of the primary tumors, the mice were
evaluated with a series of additional tests, as described below.
Interstitial ﬂuid pressure
IFP in the 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 tumors (see above) was
measured using an established wick-in-needle technique (18,
19) 1 day before tumor resection. Mice were lightly anesthetized by isoﬂurane, and 2 to 3 measurements per tumor were
made on 8 to 10 mice per group. IFP was calculated as the
pressure change (DP) from baseline to average maximum
pressure measured more than 10 seconds.
Perfusion analysis
Mice-bearing orthotopic tumors (n ¼ 5) received an intravenous injection of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-lectin 1
hour before primary tumor resection. Tumor sections stained
for CD31 were imaged by confocal microscopy (6 images per
tumor, Olympus Fluoview, 20) and colocalization analysis of
CD31 and FITC-lectin signal was conducted in ImagePro.
CD31-positive blood vessels colocalized with FITC-lectin were
identiﬁed as perfused blood vessels.
Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging
In the 4T1 efﬁcacy study described above, the vascular
perfusion and permeability of tumor tissue was measured just
before tumor resection by Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI; ref. 20). Refer to Supplementary Material for a detailed protocol description. Contrast
enhancement curves for rim and core tumor regions of 4T1
tumors were segmented and ﬁtted to the Modiﬁed Tofts model

to quantify Ktrans (inﬂux volume transfer constant from blood
to extravascular extracellular space/minute; ref. 21).
Tissue analysis
Tumor sections were stained for a-SMA with FITC and CD31
with Cy3 (refer to Supplementary Material for immunohistochemical methods). Selected slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Masson Trichrome. Fluorescently
labeled images were generated on an Olympus FluoView
confocal microscope at 20 magniﬁcation [Advanced Optical
Microscopy Facility (AOMF)], and images were quantitatively
analyzed on ImagePro Plus (Media Cybernetics). H&E or
Masson Trichrome slides were scanned on a ScanScope XT
microscope. Analyses were conducted on 5 tumors per group,
with 5 to 6 ﬁelds of view per tumor. Tumor burden in the lungs
of mice were calculated using Tissue Studio (Deﬁniens Health
Image Intelligence). Data from these analyses are expressed
as% total area.
Tumor uptake of ﬂuorescently labeled Cellax in 4T1
tumors
To facilitate a detailed analysis of Cellax distribution in 4T1
tumors, a larger tumor size was developed: when tumor
diameter reached approximately 8 mm, the mice were treated
with a single intravenous injection of DiI-labeled Cellax (200
mL, 100 mg DiI/mL content). One day later, the tumors were
harvested, ﬁxed, and prepared for a-SMA immunohistochemical staining (FITC label). Fluorescent images were scanned on
a TissueScope (Huron Technologies), and colocalization analysis of a-SMAþ cells and Cellax-DiI was conducted using
Deﬁniens software.
Intratumoral efﬁcacy
In a protocol similar to the 4T1 efﬁcacy study, we prepared a
4T1 orthotopic breast tumor model, treated the mice with
Cellax, and sacriﬁced the mice at selected time points posttherapy to analyze the response of the tumor and stromal cell
populations more than 1 week posttherapy. When tumors
reached approximately 8 mm in diameter, Cellax (170 mg
docetaxel/kg) was injected into the tail veins of the mice. At
selected times posttherapy (6, 16, 24, 72, and 168 hours), tumors
were harvested and stained with H&E or for a-SMA (FITC; n ¼
4 samples per group). Fluorescent images were scanned on a
TissueScope, and analysis of a-SMAþ cells, viable tumor
epithelial (H&E) and nonviable areas (H&E) were conducted
in Deﬁniens software.
Cellax toxicology
We have previously compared the toxicity of native docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel, and Cellax by monitoring body weight
and neutrophil count (16). Here, we studied Cellax safety using
panels of hematology and blood chemistry, and tissue histology. Balb/c mice (n ¼ 5) were dosed once weekly for 3 cycles
with Cellax (170 mg docetaxel/kg). Blood and serum samples
were collected for analysis (Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics) at baseline and 7 days after the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
doses. Further blood samples were collected at 2, 3, and 4 weeks
post ﬁnal dose. A full serology panel was only conducted at

4864

baseline and the ﬁnal 2 measurements, to minimize blood
sampling volumes. Major organs from mice at 3 and 4 weeks
post ﬁnal dose were harvested, ﬁxed in formalin, processed to
produce H&E slides, and were graded by a veterinary pathologist at the Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean  SD. Statistical analysis was
conducted with the 2-tailed unpaired t test for 2-group comparison or one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey multiple comparison test by using GraphPad Prism (for 3 or more groups). A
difference with P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
Cellax nanoparticle characterization
Cellax nanoparticle (Supplementary Fig. S1) characterization conﬁrmed data from previous reports (14–17): particles
were 121.5 nm  0.9 nm, a value that was stable at 10, 100, and
1,000 times dilution in saline. Particles exhibited a zeta potential of 8.1  0.9 mV (neutral), and tested negative for
endotoxin or microbial contamination.
Cellax depletes a-SMAþ stromal cells in the tumor,
increases vascular perfusion, and reduces metastases
Histologic analysis of 4T1 tumors resected 3 days after a
single treatment (Fig. 1A), established that Cellax treatment
induced a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) 82% reduction in a-SMA
content (Fig. 1B), compared with nonsigniﬁcant reductions
in tumors treated with native docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel.
The density of blood vessels (Fig. 1A) did not vary signiﬁcantly
among treatment groups.
Cellax treatment induced a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) increase in
blood vessel perfusion in 4T1 tumors, determined by histology
analysis of FITC-lectin–labeled–treated tumors (Fig. 1C). In
Cellax-treated mice, tumor blood vessels were better perfused
(68%) compared with vessels from control-, native docetaxel-,
and nab-paclitaxel–treated mice (0.4%–4.4%; Fig. 1D). DCEMRI analysis of treated 4T1 tumors likewise indicated that the
vascular permeability of the 4T1 tumors was improved. Postinjection of the Gd-DTPA probe, perfusion of the tumor rim
was apparent and measurable in each treatment group (representative example in Fig. 1E), with no signiﬁcant differences
in the Ktrans values (average Ktrans across groups was 0.080 
0.003 mL/g/min; Fig. 1F). The core of each tumor was less
perfused (0.014  0.003 mL/g/min in the control mice). A
signiﬁcant increase (P < 0.05) in perfusion was measured in the
core of Cellax-treated tumors (0.020  0.002 mL/g/min, Fig.
1G), whereas decreases in perfusion were measured in native
docetaxel- and nab-paclitaxel–treated tumors (0.006  0.001
and 0.008  0.002 mL/g/min, respectively). Ktrans was measured from the slope of the curves in Fig. 1G, but it is also worth
noting that the maximum concentration of the Gd-DTPA in
Cellax-treated tumors was approximately 2-fold higher compared with the control-, native docetaxel-, or nab-paclitaxel–
treated mice.
a-SMAþ stromal cells exhibit a contractile phenotype,
which contributes to vascular collapse and increased IFP

observation of increased perfusion, we evaluated the effect of
taxane therapies on IFP (Fig. 1H). IFP was reduced by 2.6-fold
by Cellax treatment compared with control, whereas native
docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel treatment had no signiﬁcant
effect on tumor pressure.
A signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) reduction in the presentation of
metastases was observed in the Cellax treatment group. All the

lung tumor burden by 6.7-fold compared with nonsigniﬁcant
decreases in the native docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel treatment
groups.
The effects of Cellax treatment observed in the 4T1 model
translated to the MDA-MB-231 orthotopic breast model. Cellax-treated tumors exhibited a 70% reduction in total a-SMA
content (Fig. 3A and B), compared with nonsigniﬁcant changes
in the native docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel treatment groups. As
the MDA-MB-231 tumors were slow growing, there was more
evidence of matrix deposition: Cellax-treated tumors exhibited
63% less detectable matrix compared with control tumors (Fig.
3D), whereas no effect was observed in the native docetaxeland nab-paclitaxel–treated tumors. Similar to the 4T1 model,
IFP was reduced by 3.8-fold in the Cellax-treated tumors
compared with the control (Fig. 3E), whereas native docetaxel
and nab-paclitaxel treatment did not reduce the tumor IFP. As
with the 4T1 model, the percentage of perfused blood vessels
(Fig. 3F) was signiﬁcantly increased in Cellax-treated MDAMB-231 tumors (30% of blood vessels), compared with low
FITC-lectin perfusion of control-, native docetaxel-, and nabpaclitaxel–treated tumors (Fig. 3G). As with the 4T1 model,
there was no signiﬁcant change in overall blood vessel density
in any treatment group. Cellax treatment reduced lung tumor
burden by 24.4-fold compared with control (P < 0.05), whereas
native docetaxel treatment increased lung tumor burden by
1.7-fold (P < 0.05), and nab-paclitaxel treatment did not
signiﬁcantly reduce tumor burden (Fig 4).

Cellax selectively associates with a-SMAþ stromal cells
in the tumor
Cellax nanoparticles exhibited a strong interaction with
stromal tissues, with more than 85% Cellax nanoparticles
colocalized with a-SMAþ cells (Fig 5A). The a-SMA stromal
depletion occurred rapidly after Cellax therapy: at 16 hours
postinjection approximately 50% of the stroma was depleted, followed by a steady and continuous decline to an almost
undetectable level (3%) after 1 week (Fig 5B). The tumor
cell population, on the other hand, was not signiﬁcantly
depleted 1 week post-Cellax injection. The nonviable tissue
fraction in the tumor increased to 60% of tumor volume
following Cellax treatment: as viable tumor cells were not
signiﬁcantly diminished in the ﬁrst week (Fig 5B), and as
a-SMAþ stromal cells were completely depleted, it follows
that stromal cell depletion was the primary effect of Cellax
therapy.
Cellax toxicology study
Cellax-treated mice did not exhibit the hallmark taxane
toxicity of neutropenia, and despite signiﬁcant clearance of
Cellax in the liver (15), no evidence of alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzyme elevation
was detected (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). The mice
did not exhibit any loss of body weight. In histopathology
analysis 1 week post the ﬁnal dose (3 doses), mild lesions were
detected in the liver (hypertrophic Kupffer cells) and the lung

Discussion
We have developed an enhanced drug delivery approach for
docetaxel, and have previously shown that Cellax nanoparticles were effective in enhancing the pharmacokinetics, safety,
and efﬁcacy of docetaxel in subcutaneous and orthotopic
mouse models of cancer (14–17). In this study, our analysis
of Cellax efﬁcacy in orthotopic breast models led to the
discovery that Cellax interacts with a-SMAþ stromal cells,

leading to increased tumor permeability and perfusion,
reduced IFP, and inhibition of metastases.
While enhancing drug delivery to the tumor tends to be a
primary focus in the ﬁeld, interaction of nanoparticles with
tumor cells or supportive stromal cells is a determinant of drug
bioavailability and antitumor activity (8). For example, while
Doxil (liposomal doxorubicin) enhances tumor delivery of
drug, the formulation exhibits a slow release proﬁle with low
bioavailability, and the efﬁcacy is therefore not enhanced
compared with native doxorubicin in human patients (8). We
have reported that Cellax nanoparticles were readily internalized by cancer cell lines in vitro as well as by cells in solid
tumors (15). Here, we report that Cellax interacted selectively

cascade. Tumor-associated stromal cells actively release paracrine signals [stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF) and many
others], deposit ECM, remodel and contract tissues, and
initiate angiogenesis (12, 23, 24). Indeed, reactive stromal
tissues share many common features with granulation tissue
(9). These processes, which are beneﬁcial in normal wound
healing, become pathologic when tumor cells are present
(12, 24). The presence of a reactive stroma (desmoplasia) is
implicated in treatment resistance, and high stromal activity
is a biomarker for poor prognosis in people with cancer, and is
associated with metastasis (12, 25). For example, women with
breast cancer expressing high tumor a-SMAþ stroma (primary
>50% stroma) exhibit a higher rate of relapse at 5 years than
women whose tumors have low stroma (<50%; refs. 26, 27).
We selected 2 well-characterized orthotopic breast cancer
models to study Cellax efﬁcacy. 4T1 is a syngeneic and aggressively metastatic model: studies examining 4T1 metastases to
lung and bone implicate stromal and ECM factors favoring
metastasis (12, 24). MDA-MB-231 is a breast xenograft model
that exhibits metastases to lung and bone, and lung metastasis
is known to be inﬂuenced by stromal-related markers (28). In
our efﬁcacy analysis, signiﬁcant reductions (7 and 24 times) in
lung metastases in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 models treated with
Cellax (Figs. 2C and 4C) were accompanied by 82% and 70%
reductions in a-SMAþ cells (Figs. 1B and 3B), respectively,
prompting further investigation into the signiﬁcance of the
stromal depletion and impact on the tumor microenvironment. Cellax did not exhibit enhanced activity against the
primary tumors in the mammary fat pad compared with native
docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel as the tumor sizes were comparable during the therapies. However, tumors treated with
Cellax were depleted of a-SMAþ stroma and the tumor
metastases were signiﬁcantly reduced, indicating the key role
of a-SMAþ stroma in promoting tumor progression in these 2
tumor models.
Reduction in stroma was accompanied by increased tumor
perfusion and reduced IFP. Deposition of matrix heavy in
collagen, ﬁbrinogen, and hyaluronan increases the rigidity of
tumors, and combined with contractile activity and poor

www.aacrjournals.org

ﬂuid transport caused by abnormal permeability and perfusion, leads to increased IFP (11). A high IFP condition
inhibits transport of oxygen and nutrients, promoting hypoxia and acidosis, conditions that in turn promote tumor
cell aggression and metastatic spread. High IFP also limits
drug transport; all these IFP-related factors contribute to
tumor resistance (29, 30). Recent data suggests that reduction of stroma ameliorates the drug delivery barrier (31),
and that depletion of stromal cells "primes" the tumor microenvironment for decreased IFP and enhanced drug penetration (32, 33). Cellax treatment reduced a-SMAþ stroma,
reduced IFP by more than 50% in both the 4T1 and MDAMB-231 tumors (Figs. 1H and 3E), and increased blood perfusion in the tumor core by more than 60 fold, as measured
by FITC-lectin histology (Figs. 1D and 3G). The data in this
study supports the hypothesis that reduced stroma is linked
to reduced IFP and perfusion, and linked to a reduction in
tumor growth and metastases.
Tumor perfusion can be characterized noninvasively by
MRI, via application of DCE-MRI (34–37). The DCE data
indicating higher permeability supports the histologic analysis
of perfusion and the IFP data: 3 days following Cellax treatment, the tumor vessel permeability in the core of tumors
(Ktrans) was signiﬁcantly increased compared with other therapies (Fig. 1F).
Neither native docetaxel or nab-paclitaxel treatments signiﬁcantly altered a-SMA content in the 4T1 and MDA-MB-231
tumors, nor were there signiﬁcant alterations to matrix or
IFP. Native docetaxel treatment increased the number of
lung metastases in the MDA-MB-231 model, suggesting that
chemotherapy treatment could induce a more aggressive
phenotype of tumor. Shaked and colleagues (38) observed
that taxane therapy increased the production of SDF-1 and
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor from host cells, factors
that promoted tumor revascularization and progression. The
plasma collected from the taxane-treated mice induced bonemarrow–derived cells and tumors cells to release MMP-9,
and enhanced the invasiveness and metastasis of the tumor
cells. In addition, damage to tumor vasculature by chemotherapy or antivascular antibodies can lead to recruitment of

endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), promoting angiogenesis,
leading to increased IFP and decreased permeability (12, 38,
39). These negative effects induced by standard taxanes were
observed in our animal models, including decreased permeability and perfusion (4T1 model), and increased metastases (MDAMB-231 model). In contrast, Cellax did not induce these effects.
We have reported that Cellax nanoparticles accumulate in
tumors by the EPR effect, but these earlier studies did not
identity which cell populations Cellax was interacting with in
the tumor microenvironment (15, 17). The stroma-depleting
activity of Cellax could be a primary (Cellax-targeted stroma)
or secondary effect (Cellax induced toxicity in tumor cells ﬁrst,
resulting in deactivation of the stromal cells). To elucidate the
mode of action of Cellax, we analyzed the intratumoral uptake
and therapeutic impact of Cellax in a-SMA stroma and tumor
cells separately. One day after an intravenous dose of ﬂuorescently labeled Cellax (Cellax-DiI), the nanoparticles preferentially colocalized with a-SMA stromal cells (>85%) (Fig 5A).
The kinetics of population decline of a-SMA and tumor cells in
the 4T1 tumor agree with the intratumoral uptake data. As the
majority of Cellax was taken up by a-SMAþ cells, the a-SMA
content in the tumor rapidly decreased from approximately
30% to approximately 10% of the tumor area at 16 hours
posttreatment, and then steadily declined to almost 0% in 1
week. The epithelial tumor cell population did not interact as
signiﬁcantly with Cellax nanoparticles, was not affected for the
ﬁrst 3 days of therapy, and the population only started to
decline when the a-SMA was depleted on day 7 (Fig. 5B). The
data suggest that a-SMAþ stroma is the primary target of
Cellax, and the decline of the tumor cell population could be
attributed to the residually released dose from Cellax nanoparticles or decreased paracrine survival signals from the
stromal cells. The molecular mechanism for the interaction
of Cellax with a-SMAþ stroma is under investigation. In
preliminary studies, we have discovered that Cellax efﬁciently
adsorbs serum albumin (0.5 mg albumin/mg polymer), and the
cellular internalization of Cellax is favored by SPARCþ (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) cells, especially in the
presence of albumin. Stromal cells (especially aSMAþ CAF)
produce signiﬁcantly elevated levels of SPARC: in nab-paclitaxel and now Cellax studies, there seems to be a stromal
interaction due to the albumin-SPARC mechanism (40). We
had previously observed toxicity effects arising from native
docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel treatments in mice, with more
than 50% reductions in neutrophils after 1 dose at their MTDs,
and this effect was sustained over multiple doses (15, 16).
Conversely, Cellax treatment was not observed to induce
neutropenia. To further substantiate the safety proﬁle of
Cellax, we monitored mice for 4 weeks following 3 weekly
cycles at the 170 mg docetaxel/kg level, scrutinizing for late
presentation of toxicity upon multiple doses, given that Cellax
is a long-circulating and slow releasing formulation. No abnormalities appeared in hematology or blood chemistry parameters during dosing or postdosing (all parameters were
within normal limits for Balb/c mice; Fig. 6 and Supplementary
Table S1). Pathologic analysis of liver tissues 1 week subsequent to the 3rd dose indicated hypertrophy in selected
Kupffer cells (macrophages), an observation consistent with

4870

Cancer Res; 73(15) August 1, 2013

the biodistribution of Cellax (15) and many other nanoparticle systems (41), in which the RES (reticuloendothelial
system) is the major system of clearance. Kupffer cells are
responsible for clearance of foreign particles, and are cells
that are continuously replenished. Cellax accumulation
to lung tissues was identiﬁed previously as insigniﬁcant
(15). We tested the serum of mice treated with 170 mg
docetaxel/kg Cellax for indicators of an inﬂammatory response using a Luminex assay for 23 inﬂammatory cytokines
(Supplementary Fig S2), and detected no elevation of any
cytokine. As the ﬁndings in the liver and lungs were minor
and attenuated by 4 weeks, with no evidence of ﬁbrosis,
necrosis, blood vessel disruption, or organ malfunction, we
conclude that organ responses at the 170 mg docetaxel/kg
dose were within acceptable parameters.
In summary, we have shown that Cellax interacted substantially with tumor stroma and depleted this population in 2
orthotopic breast tumor models. Tumor stroma is an established prognostic marker for survival in women with breast
cancer (9, 26), largely due to stromal inﬂuence on tumor
survival and metastasis. In the 2 mouse models, Cellax treatment depleted stroma and inhibited matrix deposition,
decreased tumor IFP, increased perfusion, and signiﬁcantly
suppressed lung metastases.
