Abstract
Doxorubicin is a frequently used anticancer drug, but its
therapeutic benefit is limited by acute and chronic cardiotoxicity, often leading to heart failure. The mechanisms underlying doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity remain unclear. It
was previously shown in men that doxorubicin leads to
increased endothelin-1 plasma levels. In addition, cardiacspecific overexpression of endothelin-1 in mice resulted in
a cardiomyopathy resembling the phenotype following doxorubicin administration. We therefore hypothesized that
endothelin-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity. In mice (C57Bl/10), we found that doxorubicin
(20 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) impaired cardiac function with
decreased ejection fraction, diminished cardiac output, and
decreased end-systolic pressure points recorded by a microconductance catheter. This impaired function was accompanied by the up-regulation of endothelin-1 expression on mRNA
and protein level. In vitro investigations confirmed the
regulation of endothelin-1 by doxorubicin and indicated that
the doxorubicin-mediated increase of endothelin-1 expression
involves epidermal growth factor receptor signaling via the
MEK1/2-ERK1/2 cascade, which was further confirmed by
immunoblotting studies in the left ventricle of treated
animals. Pretreatment of mice with the endothelin receptor
antagonist bosentan (100 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) strikingly
inhibited doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity with preserved
indices of contractility. Moreover, bosentan pretreatment
resulted in reduced tumor necrosis factor-A content, lipid
peroxidation, and Bax expression, as well as increased GATA-4
expression. Thus, endothelin-1 plays a key role in mediating
the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin and its inhibition may
be of therapeutic benefit for patients receiving doxorubicin.

congestive heart failure (CHF) with poor prognosis (1). Despite its
longstanding application for >20 years, the mechanisms underlying
doxorubicin cardiotoxicity remain unclear. One hypothesis was
that doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is primarily mediated by
the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiomyocytes.
The application of antioxidants, however, did not prevent
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy pointing to a more complex
pathogenesis (2).
Notably, elevated endothelin-1 (ET-1) plasma levels were found
in patients treated with doxorubicin (3). In addition, mechanistic
studies in mice by Yang and colleagues revealed that cardiacspecific overexpression of ET-1 leads to cardiomyopathy and left
ventricle (LV) dysfunction combined with inflammatory characteristics such as increased tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) content
and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates (4). Moreover, ET-1 has
been implicated in the progression of CHF because the expression
of ET-1 and its receptors are elevated in the myocardium of rats
with CHF and in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
(5, 6). Taken together, these data suggest the involvement of ET-1 in
the development of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
In the present study, we could show that ET-1 mRNA and protein
expression was up-regulated by doxorubicin in the LV of C57Bl/10
mice. In parallel, cardiac function was strongly impaired with a
decrease in ejection fraction and diminished cardiac output.
Pretreatment with the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan
(Tracleer) inhibited the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin in mice,
resulting in reduced TNFa content, lipid peroxidation, Bax
expression, and increased GATA-4 expression. In vitro experiments
using both primary cardiomyocytes and cell lines confirmed the
induction of ET-1 by doxorubicin and elucidated the molecular
pathway involving activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)
receptor and the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 cascade.

Materials and Methods
Introduction
Doxorubicin is one of the most frequently used anticancer
agents in the treatment of both solid and hematologic malignancies. Its therapeutic use is limited by cardiotoxicity categorized as
acute or chronic events. The doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is
characterized by left ventricular dysfunction, often leading to

Chemicals and reagents. Bosentan was obtained from Actelion
Pharmaceuticals. The MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and the EGF receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 were from Cell Signalling Technology.
Epirubicin was purchased from Pharmacia GmbH. All other chemicals were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Animals. For animal experiments, C57Bl/10ScSn wild-type mice ages 8 to
10 weeks were obtained from the breeding stocks of the Max-Planck-Institut
für Immunologie (Freiburg, Germany). In the first study protocol, mice were
assigned to two groups: (a) doxorubicin (Doxo Cell; 20 mg/kg single dose,
i.p., a dose shown to be cardiotoxic; ref. 7) and (b) the same volume of saline.
After doxorubicin injection (1 and 5 days), mice were hemodynamically
characterized. For surgical procedures and hemodynamic measurements,
animals were anesthetized (thiopental, 125 Ag/g, i.p.), intubated and
artificially ventilated. As recently described (8), a 1.4 F microconductance

pressure catheter (ARIA SPR-719; Millar-Instruments, Inc.) was positioned in
the LV for continuous registration of LV pressure-volume loops in a closedchest model.
In the second study, mice were assigned to four groups: (a) doxorubicin
(Doxo Cell; 20 mg/kg, single dose, i.p.), (b) the same volume of saline, (c)
bosentan (100 mg/kg body weight, p.o., daily from 3 days before doxorubicin
application until day 5) plus doxorubicin (Doxo Cell; 20 mg/kg, single dose,
i.p.), or (d) bosentan (100 mg/kg p.o., daily for 8 days). The experiments
were done in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals published by the U.S. NIH (NIH Publication no. 85-23, revised 1985).
Tissue preparation. After hemodynamic characterization, hearts were
removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For immunohistochemical analyses, tissues were embedded in optimum cutting temperature
compound (Tissue Tec) and stored at 80jC.
Cell culture. The murine cardiomyocyte–derived HL-1 cells were a kind
gift from Prof. W. Claycomb (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology, Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA) and
were maintained in Claycomb medium (JRH Biosciences) supplemented
with 10% FCS (JRH Biosciences), 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine (SeromedBiochrom KG), 100 Amol/L of arterenol (Sigma Aldrich), and 100 units/mL
of penicillin/streptomycin (Seromed-Biochrom KG). The cervix carcinoma
cell line HeLa was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and
cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mmol/L of
L-glutamine.
Rat ventricular myocytes were isolated as described previously (9).
Immediately after the isolation and separation procedure, cells were plated
on laminin-coated 12-well plates using creatine (5 mmol/L), L-carnitine
(2 mmol/L), and taurine (5 mmol/L)–supplemented medium 199 as
described by Piper and coworkers (10).
RNA preparation and cDNA synthesis. Heart samples were homogenized and total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). RNA
from cell culture experiments were isolated using peqGold RNA Pure
(peqLab). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the TaqMan Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems).
Quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was
done on ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems).
Primer and probe oligonucleotides for human ppET-1 were previously
published (11). Murine ppET-1 primer and probe oligonucleotides ( forward
primer, 5¶-TGTTCGTGACTTTCCAAGG-3¶; reverse primer, 5¶-AGCTCCGGTGCTGAGTTCGG-3¶; probe, 5¶-6FAM-CTCCAGAAACAGCTGTC-3¶) were
designed based on the reference sequence U35233. Rat ppET-1 primer and
probe oligonucleotides ( forward primer, 5¶-TG GACATCATCTGGGTCAACA-3¶; reverse primer, 5¶-GCTTAGACCTAGAAGGGCTTCC-3¶; probe,
5¶-6FAM-TCCCGAGCGCGTCGTCCCGTATGGA-3¶) were designed based on
the reference sequence NM_012548. For normalization, 18S rRNA TaqMan
PreDeveloped Assay Reagent (Applied Biosystems) was used and signals
were applied to a cloned standard of the respective gene and 18S rRNA.
Preparation of protein extracts. Cells were harvested in PBS and
pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000  g. Pellets were resuspended in 150 AL
of lysis buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Triton
X-100, and 5 mmol/L EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mg/L
aprotinin, 0.5 mg/L leupeptin, and 100 Amol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride) and incubated for 45 min on ice. After a centrifugation step at
6,000  g, supernatant was used for the determination of protein content by
the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method.
For preparation of membrane fractions, the cell pellets were resuspended
in 5 mmol/L of Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors,
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 37jC four times. Crude
membranes were isolated by a centrifugation step at 100,000  g at 4jC for
30 min. The supernatant was collected and pellets were resolved in 5 mmol/L
of Tris-HCl supplemented with protease inhibitors. Protein concentration
was measured according to the BCA method.
For tissue protein extraction, LV samples were homogenized in 150 AL of
Tris-sucrose (pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 1.5 min at 1,500 rpm. Thereafter,
lysates were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 37jC four times,
followed by a centrifugation step at 4jC. The supernatant was collected and
protein concentration was measured according to the BCA method.

Immunofluorescence microscopy. Cryopreserved sections (7 Am) were
generated via a CM1900 cryostat (Leica). Protein localization was
investigated by confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence microscopy.
For ET-1 detection, the Endothelin-1 Immunohistochemistry Staining Kit
(Bachem AG) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol with the
exception of the secondary antibody. As secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor
488–labeled IgG (anti-rabbit IgG; Invitrogen) was used. Staining of actin
filaments was done using Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (Invitrogen). After
staining, slices were mounted in DAKO Fluorescent Mounting Medium
(Dako Cytomation).
Western blot analysis. Immunoblotting was done using standard
techniques. The following antibodies were used: anti-phospho-MEK1/2,
anti-MEK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (all from Cell Signaling Technology),
anti-ERK1/2 (Promega), anti-EGF receptor and anti-phospho-EGF receptor
(Upstate Biotech), anti-Bax and anti-Bcl-xL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and
anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Biodesign International). As secondary antibodies, we used goat anti-mouse or swine antirabbit antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (DAKO). Blots were
visualized with LumiPhos reagent (Pierce). Before reincubation with
another antibody, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mmol/L of Tris-HCl,
2% SDS (pH 6.8) for 15 min at 52jC. Densitometric evaluation was done
using the program ImageQuant.
Determination of ET-1 and TNFA by ELISA. Myocardial ET-1 and
TNFa were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using protein extracts from cells or tissues.
Values were normalized to the protein content.
Lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation in LV was measured with the
commercially available colorimetric assay kit Bioxytech LPO-586 (Oxis
International) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the
calculation of lipid peroxidation, samples were applied to a MDA standard
curve and normalized to the relative protein content.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of animal experiments was done
using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test to compare
groups shown as the median as well as the 25th and 75th percentiles.
Student’s t test was employed for comparison of the in vitro experiments.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were
done using SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS Inc.).

Results
ET-1 induction by doxorubicin in vivo. After doxorubicin
administration (1 and 5 days), LV of C57Bl/10 mice were used to
determine the prepro-ET-1 (ppET-1) mRNA and ET-1 peptide
content. As early as 24 h after doxorubicin administration, a
significant increase of ppET-1 mRNA from 0.57 (0.38–1.43)  10 7
to 1.59 (1.23–4.28)  10 7 was observed. This up-regulation of
ppET-1 mRNA was further enhanced 5 days after doxorubicin
application to 2.17 (1.77–4.84)  10 7 (Fig. 1A). On the protein
level, doxorubicin treatment resulted in a significant increase of
ET-1 peptide level after 1 day from 0.17 (0.10–0.18) pg/mg (control)
to 0.29 (0.21–0.50) pg/mg (doxorubicin). Five days after doxorubicin
application, the ET-1 peptide content was significantly increased as
well, with a value of 0.31 (0.23–0.35) pg/mg (Fig. 1A).
The detection of ET-1 peptide in cryopreserved slides of LV of
C57Bl/10 mice confirmed the increase in ET-1 expression after
5 days of doxorubicin treatment. In control animals, there was only
a slight staining of ET-1 recognizable by the green fluorescence,
which was markedly increased after doxorubicin treatment
(Fig. 1B). For counterstaining of cells, we used phalloidin-staining
of actin filaments (red fluorescence).
ET-1 induction by doxorubicin in vitro. For investigation of
the doxorubicin effect in vitro, we used the murine cardiomyocyte cell line HL-1, the cervix carcinoma cells HeLa and adult
rat cardiomyocytes. Figure 1C and D show the results for
ET-1 expression analysis in adult rat cardiomyocytes. After 48 h,

induction of ET-1 by doxorubicin seen with ELISA experiments
(Fig. 1D).
In HL-1 cells, treatment with doxorubicin at concentrations of
0.1, 0.3, and 1 Amol/L for 48 h resulted in a significant regulation of
ppET-1 mRNA from 0.16 (F0.08)  10 7 (control) to 0.25 (F0.18) 
10 7, 0.49 (F0.22)  10 7, and 0.83 (F0.49)  10 7, respectively.
Induction of ET-1 expression by doxorubicin in HL-1 cells was
further confirmed on the protein level. Untreated control HL-1 cells
showed an intracellular ET-1 content of 10.2 (F0.54) pg/mg, which
was increased with 0.1 and 1 Amol/L of doxorubicin up to 15.7
(F1.33) and 27.11 (F7.97) pg/mg, respectively (data for HL-1 cells
are not shown). In HeLa cells, we also observed a concentrationdependent increase of ppET-1 mRNA expression after 48 h of
doxorubicin treatment. Maximum effects on ppET-1 mRNA
expression were observed at 1 Amol/L of doxorubicin with a value
of 6.17 (F1.11)  10 5 versus 0.84 (F0.13) for control cells. On
protein level, the maximum effect was also observed at 1 Amol/L of
doxorubicin with an increase in intracellular ET-1 from 19.79
(F3.49, control) to 64.03 (F12.13) pg/mg (data for HeLa cells are
not shown).
Involvement of EGF receptor and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 cascade.
The influence of doxorubicin on phosphorylation of the EGF
receptor was studied by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2A,
treatment of mice with doxorubicin for 3 h resulted in a strong
phosphorylation of the cardiac EGF receptor with an increase in
arbitrary units (au, determined by densitometry and normalization

doxorubicin-treated cardiomyocytes. Determination of the ET-1
peptide content confirmed the ET-1 induction by doxorubicin.
After an incubation period of 48 and 72 h, an increase in ET-1

and of 0.33 (F0.07) to 0.88 (F0.15) in HeLa cells, respectively;
P < 0.05]. Elevated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, the kinase directly
downstream of MEK1/2, could also be shown [densitometric values
of 0.17 (F0.02) to 0.28 (F0.02) in HL-1 cells and of 0.42 (F0.33) to
1.32 (F0.56) in HeLa cells; P < 0.05; Fig. 3B]. Pretreatment of HL-1
cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (10 Amol/L) resulted in a
decrease of ppET-1 mRNA induction from 0.17 (F0.03, doxorubicin)
 10 7 to 0.13 (F0.03, doxorubicin+PD98059)  10 7 (Fig. 3C).
Accordingly, the doxorubicin-mediated increase of ppET-1 mRNA
expression in adult rat cardiomyocytes was significantly decreased
by PD98059 from 3.40 (1.16–9.64)  10 8 (doxorubicin alone) to 1.05
(0.92–8.12)  10 8 (doxorubicin+PD98059; Fig. 3D). Inhibition
experiments in HeLa cells with PD98059 (10 Amol/L) resulted in a
significantly reduced ppET-1 mRNA induction from 7.65 (F2.86) 
10 6 (doxorubicin) to 4.42 (F1.65)  10 6 (doxorubicin + PD98059).
Bosentan itself had no effect on the doxorubicin-mediated
phosphorylation of EGF receptor, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in vitro as
determined by immunoblotting and subsequent densitometric
evaluation (data not shown).
Hemodynamic effects of doxorubicin. Hemodynamic measurements done 1 and 5 days after doxorubicin administration are
summarized in Table 1. One day after doxorubicin application, both
systolic and diastolic LV function indexed by dp/dt max ( 30%) and
dp/dt min (+22%) was impaired. These parameters deteriorated
progressively until day 5 after doxorubicin administration compared with nontreated controls (dp/dt max, 43% and dp/dt min,
+39%). At this time point, myocardial stiffness as an index of
diastolic function was enhanced to f350% in doxorubicin-treated
mice compared with controls. Systolic and diastolic LV dysfunction
at day 5 after doxorubicin application led to impaired global LV
function indexed by heart rate ( 21%), stroke volume ( 47%), and
cardiac output ( 60%).

doxorubicin; P < 0.05) au. In addition, phosphorylation of the
kinases MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 were increased from 0.014 (0.009–0.09,
control) to 0.11 (0.039–0.14, doxorubicin; P < 0.05) au for MEK1/2
and from 0.057 (0.017–0.095, control) to 0.092 (0.083–0.13,
doxorubicin; P < 0.05) au for ERK1/2, respectively (Fig. 3A).
Exposure of HL-1 cardiomyocytes and HeLa cells to doxorubicin
(1 Amol/L) resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylated EGF
receptor after 1 h, from 0.32 (F0.13) to 0.64 (F0.06) au in HL-1 cells
and from 1.1 (F0.42) to 2.4 (F0.59) au in HeLa cells, respectively
(P < 0.05; Fig. 2B). Pretreatment of HL-1 cells with 10 Amol/L of
AG1478, a specific inhibitor of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase,
resulted in a decrease of ppET-1 mRNA induction from 0.17 (F0.03,
doxorubicin alone)  10 7 to 0.10 (F0.03, doxorubicin + AG1478)
 10 7 (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the doxorubicin-mediated increase of
ppET-1 mRNA expression in adult rat cardiomyocytes was
significantly decreased by preincubation with AG1478 from 10.1
(3.43–31.02)  10 8 (doxorubicin alone) to 5.06 (1.02–9.06)  10 8
(doxorubicin + AG1478; Fig. 2D). Pretreatment of HeLa cells with
10 Amol/L of AG1478 significantly reduced the ppET-1 mRNA
induction from 2.46 (F0.34)  10 6 (doxorubicin alone) to 1.21
(F0.16)  10 6 (doxorubicin + AG1478).
Moreover, involvement of the MEK1/2–ERK1/2 cascade was
studied in vitro by immunoblot analysis and inhibition experiments. As shown in Fig. 3B, doxorubicin treatment of HL-1 and
HeLa cells resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of MEK1/2
[densitometric values of 1.26 (F0.11) to 2.08 (F0.09) in HL-1 cells

in the LV as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5B). Again,
bosentan pretreatment caused a strong decline in Bax protein level
to a value of 1.01 (0.77–1.2; P < 0.01). Furthermore, we tested
whether doxorubicin treatment caused an increase of lipid
peroxidation in LV by measurement of MDA/HAE levels. Five days
after doxorubicin administration, there was a significant increase
in MDA/HAE content from 746 (656–885) to 1,062 (1,002–1,188)
nmol/L, which was significantly diminished by bosentan application to 874 (816–944) nmol/L (Fig. 5A).
It has been reported that doxorubicin reduces the expression of
the transcription factor GATA-4 (13). Therefore, we also examined
whether this effect was modulated by bosentan in vivo. As shown
in Fig. 5C, 5 days after doxorubicin application, the GATA-4
mRNA content in the LV of mice was significantly reduced from

C57Bl/10 mice were pretreated with bosentan (100 mg/kg body weight) 3 d
before i.p. application of doxorubicin (20 mg/kg body weight) and then parallel
to doxorubicin until day 5. Heart function was measured by conductance catheter
method: control (n = 8), control + bosentan (n = 5), doxorubicin (n = 8),

Doxorubicin + bosentan–treated mice showed improved systolic
(dp/dt max, +56%; LV pressure, +18%), diastolic (dp/dt min, 47%),
and global LV function as compared with doxorubicin-treated
animals. Myocardial stiffness was significantly decreased ( 61%) in
bosentan-treated doxorubicin-mice compared with doxorubicintreated mice.
Effect of bosentan on doxorubicin-induced TNFA content,
expression of Bax, GATA-4, and ET-1 as well as lipid
peroxidation. Five days after doxorubicin administration, the
TNFa content was significantly increased from 5.3 (4.3–7.9; control)
to 11.9 (7.8–20.1) pg/mg (Fig. 5A). This doxorubicin-mediated
increase in cardiac TNFa level was reduced by bosentan
pretreatment to 7.9 (5.6–9.7) pg/mg, which was not significantly
different from the control level. TNFa itself is able to induce a
variety of proapoptotic proteins such as Bax (12). Doxorubicin
treatment of C57Bl/10 mice resulted in an enhanced Bax
expression with an increase in arbitrary units from 0.72 (0.48–
1.49) in control animals to 1.64 (1.36–1.91; P < 0.01) 5 days after

0.83 (0.67–1.17) in control animals to 0.23 (0.19–0.5). Pretreatment
of animals with bosentan resulted in an increased GATA-4
expression with a value of 1.47 (0.76–1.80). Five days after doxorubicin administration, we could also show a significant suppression of GATA-4 protein levels [arbitrary units of 1.10 (0.40–1.12) to
0.38 (0.09–0.78); P < 0.05]. The decrease in GATA-4 protein was
partly reversed by bosentan pretreatment [arbitrary units of 0.71
(0.24–1.09)] without reaching significance against doxorubicin
treatment (P = 0.15; Fig. 5D).
In addition, we investigated whether bosentan alone affects ET-1
expression in the LV of C57Bl/10 mice. As shown in Fig. 5C,
bosentan had no significant influence on ET-1 peptide expression
of doxorubicin-treated animals. Moreover, ppET-1 mRNA was not
altered by bosentan (data not shown).

Discussion
The clinical use of doxorubicin is limited by cardiotoxicity, which
often leads to progressive heart failure with impaired contractility,
arrhythmias, or sudden death (1). The precise mechanisms
underlying this phenomenon have not been fully understood thus
far. Therefore, characterization of these mechanisms and subsequent development of cardioprotective therapeutic strategies are of
interest.
In the present study, a mouse model (C57Bl/10) of doxorubicininduced cardiomyopathy was established and cardiac function was
assessed using the microconductance pressure catheter method.
We identified serious systolic and diastolic LV dysfunction with
reduced LV pressure, dP/dt, and cardiac output after doxorubicin
application. In humans, cardiac failure is similarly characterized by
LV dysfunction with impaired systolic and diastolic function, and a
reduced LV ejection fraction is a commonly used parameter for
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (14). These data suggest that
our animal model resembles myocardial changes due to doxorubicin toxicity in patients.
Similar characteristics of cardiomyopathy such as significantly
lower LV pressure and dP/dt max were also found in mice
overexpressing ET-1 orthotopically in cardiomyocytes (4). This
led to the hypothesis that ET-1 might be an important mediator of
doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Accordingly, increased ppET-1 mRNA
and ET-1 peptide contents were measured in the LV of C57Bl/10
mouse hearts after doxorubicin application in our study. ET-1
displays its effects through binding on ETA or ETB receptors. Both
ETA and ETB receptors are present on cardiomyocytes and cardiac
fibroblasts, with ETA representing f90% of the endothelin
receptors on cardiomyocytes (15). Besides increased expression
of ET-1, its receptors are also elevated in the myocardium of rats
with CHF and in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
(5, 6). Such an elevation of endothelin receptor subtype A and B
was not observed in the LV of mouse hearts after doxorubicin
application in our study (data not shown). In order to elucidate the
pathways used for the regulation of ET-1 by doxorubicin, signaling
experiments were carried out in cell lines and adult rat
cardiomyocytes. Investigations in the murine cardiomyocyte cell
line HL-1 retaining differentiated cardiac morphologic, biochemical, and electrophysiologic properties (16) confirmed the regulation of ET-1 by doxorubicin. In the human tumor cell line HeLa, a
cellular system in which production, secretion, and function of ET1 have been recently characterized in detail (17), doxorubicin also
increased ET-1 expression. In HeLa cells, the up-regulation of ET-1
was caused by other anthracycline derivatives as well, including

www.aacrjournals.org

daunorubicin, epirubicin, and idarubicin, whereas cytostatics from
other classes failed to increase ET-1 mRNA with the exception of
mitoxantron for which cardiotoxic events have been described as
well (data not shown; ref. 18). Accordingly, treatment of adult rat
ventricular cardiomyocytes with doxorubicin resulted in significant
increases of ET-1 mRNA and peptide. In all investigated cells, the
increase of ppET-1 mRNA was stronger compared with ET-1
peptide. This phenomenon might be caused by the fact that ET-1 is
secreted, and therefore, the intracellular peptide content reflects
only a fraction of the synthesized ET-1 (19).
Recently, it was shown that doxorubicin can activate the MEK1/2ERK1/2 cascade due to ligand-independent activation of the EGF
receptor (20). Both EGF receptor and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 were activated following doxorubicin administration in our study in vitro
and in vivo in the LV of mouse hearts. Further inhibition
experiments with the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor
AG1478 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 confirmed the role of
EGF receptor and MEK1/2 in the regulation of ET-1 expression. In
the 5¶-region of the ET-1 gene, several regulatory elements were
located (21). Analysis of the ET-1 promoter showed that a potential
regulatory site for ET-1 induction by doxorubicin is located between
68 and 517 bp upstream of the start ATG. In this region, an
activator protein binding site is present at 109 bp (22), which is
involved in ET-1 regulation by doxorubicin as shown in reporter
gene assays with a mutated AP-1 binding site (data not shown).
Up to this point, we could show that ET-1 is modulated by
doxorubicin in both animal and cellular models. In order to
elucidate whether ET-1 plays a role in doxorubicin-induced
cardiotoxicity, we investigated the influence of the orally administered combined ETA/B receptor antagonist bosentan (23) on
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Pretreatment with bosentan
before doxorubicin application significantly protected against
doxorubicin-induced LV dysfunction (without having influenced
the ET-1 level itself) as shown by the improved systolic and
diastolic function compared with doxorubicin-treated animals.
These effects are similar to those described with the endothelin
receptor antagonist LU420627 in animals overexpressing ET-1 in
cardiomyocytes (4). Aside from doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, the endothelin system is activated in patients with chronic
heart failure. In fact, the increased plasma ET-1 concentrations
correlate with the hemodynamic severity and prognosis in these
patients. Therefore, clinical trials of endothelin blockade in heart
failure patients were undertaken. However, the results of these
studies were neutral in terms of mortality and symptoms (24),
leading to an intense discussion on whether the use of receptor
subtype–specific endothelin receptor blockers may be of advantage.
Interestingly, the above cited study by Yang and coworkers showed
that the combined ETA/ETB antagonist LU420627, but not the
selective ETA antagonist LU135252, prolonged the survival of
ET-1–overexpressing cardiomyopathic mice (4).
Moreover, ET-1 has been associated with cell growth, angiogenesis, and development of metastasis, and hence, to the progression
of some types of cancer (e.g., prostate carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma,
or ovarian and breast cancer). Therefore, the use of endothelin
receptor antagonists, including bosentan, as anticancer drugs has
been addressed in experimental and clinical settings (25–28).
It is known that myocardial overexpression of ET-1 initiates an
inflammatory cascade and elevates the expression of TNFa, IFN-g,
interleukin 1, and interleukin 6. We therefore investigated the effect
of doxorubicin on the production of the proinflammatory cytokine
TNFa. Five days after doxorubicin application, we detected an

increase in TNFa content in the LV of mouse hearts, which is in
accordance with a previous study of Nozaki et al. (7). TNFa itself is
cardiotoxic and induces the depression of cardiac function (29).
Moreover, a cardiac-specific overexpression of TNFa in transgenic
mice leads to cardiomyopathy (30). Whether TNFa is a mediator of
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy has not been clarified thus far.
However, when mice were treated with doxorubicin plus bosentan,
the induction of TNFa was significantly reduced, which implicates
that ET-1 may play a role in the regulation of TNFa expression and
that both are involved in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Such an
inflammatory component in doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity
was already suggested in 1993 by Gaudin and coworkers (31) and is
underlined by a study of Deepa and Varalakshmi in which
inflammatory changes in the cardiac tissue of rats given doxorubicin
were observed (32). Furthermore, the role of inflammation is
corroborated by the recently published data that doxorubicin
strongly induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression, which was reduced
by erythropoietin following the prevention of cardiomyopathy (33).
A potential role of apoptotic processes in the development of
heart failure is discussed. Apoptosis may contribute to cardiomyocyte loss and structural changes accompanied by up-regulation of
the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax (34). Accordingly, we
found a doxorubicin-mediated increase in the cardiac protein
expression of Bax which was reduced under bosentan treatment. It
is possible that increased Bax expression is induced by TNFa, for
which the stimulation of proapoptotic factors was shown (35). Kim
et al. could show that doxorubicin suppressed the expression of
GATA-4 and suggest an antiapoptotic role of this transcription
factor in cardiomyocytes, particularly by the regulation of Bcl-2
(13). Suppression of GATA-4 mRNA in the LV of mouse hearts was
confirmed by our study, supporting the initiation of apoptotic
processes. Moreover, pretreatment with bosentan restored the
GATA-4 mRNA to the control level, again indicating prevention
against apoptotic processes.

The generation of ROS and lipid peroxidation have also been
discussed as a factor contributing to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity
(36, 37). In our mouse model, bosentan reduced the doxorubicininduced lipid peroxidation indicating the participation of ET-1 in
lipid peroxidation. A possible source of the increased ROS leading
to lipid peroxidation could be the enzyme NADP(H) oxidase. In
smooth muscle cells and blood vessels, ET-1 activates NADP(H)
oxidase (38, 39), suggesting a possible activation in the heart as
well. This finding is supported by recently discovered polymorphisms of the NADP(H) oxidase which are associated with
anthracyclin-induced cardiotoxicity (40).
In summary, our study shows that doxorubicin mediates the upregulation of ET-1 expression which is accompanied by LV
dysfunction resembling doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in
patients. Doxorubicin-modulated ET-1 expression involves the
activation of the EGF receptor and the MEK1/2–ERK1/2 cascade.
Finally, the combined endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan
reduced doxorubicin-mediated LV dysfunction accompanied with
decreased TNFa and Bax, diminished lipid peroxidation, and
increased GATA-4 expression. Aside from mechanistic aspects, the
present investigations suggest the cardioprotective role of bosentan
in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, which may be of therapeutic benefit for patients receiving doxorubicin.
