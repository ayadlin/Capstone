Abstract
Large intervening noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are pervasively transcribed in the genome1, 2, 3
yet their potential involvement in human disease is not well understood4,5. Recent studies of
dosage compensation, imprinting, and homeotic gene expression suggest that individual lincRNAs
can function as the interface between DNA and specific chromatin remodeling activities6,7,8.
Here we show that lincRNAs in the HOX loci become systematically dysregulated during breast
cancer progression. The lincRNA termed HOTAIR is increased in expression in primary breast
tumors and metastases, and HOTAIR expression level in primary tumors is a powerful predictor of
eventual metastasis and death. Enforced expression of HOTAIR in epithelial cancer cells induced
genome-wide re-targeting of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to an occupancy pattern
more resembling embryonic fibroblasts, leading to altered histone H3 lysine 27 methylation, gene

expression, and increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis in a manner dependent on PRC2.
Conversely, loss of HOTAIR can inhibit cancer invasiveness, particularly in cells that possess
excessive PRC2 activity. These findings suggest that lincRNAs play active roles in modulating the
cancer epigenome and may be important targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

We hybridized RNA derived from normal human breast epithelia, primary breast
carcinomas, and distant metastases to ultra-dense HOX tiling arrays7 (Fig. 1a, b). We found
that 233 transcribed regions in the HOX loci, comprising 170 ncRNAs and 63 HOX exons,
were differentially expressed (Fig. 1a). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed
systematic variation in the expression of HOX lincRNAs among normal breast epithelia,
primary tumor, and metastases. HOXA5, a known breast tumor suppressor11 along with
dozens of HOX lincRNAs, are expressed in normal breast but with reduced expression in all
cancer samples (Supplementary Fig. 1). A set of HOX lincRNAs and mRNAs, including the
known oncogene HOXB712, are frequently expressed in primary tumors but not in
metastases (Supplementary Fig. 1). A distinct set of HOX lincRNAs are sometimes
overexpressed in primary tumors, and very frequently overexpressed in metastases (Fig. 1b).
Notably, one such metastasis-associated lincRNA is HOTAIR (Fig. 1b), which has a unique
association with patient prognosis (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, Supplementary Table 1).
HOTAIR is a lincRNA in the mammalian HOXC locus that binds to and targets the PRC2
complex to the HOXD locus, located on a different chromosome7. PRC2 is a histone H3
lysine 27 methylase involved in developmental gene silencing and cancer progression9,10.
We hypothesized that altered HOTAIR expression may be involved in human cancer by
promoting genomic relocalization of Polycomb complex and H3K27 trimethylation.

Author Manuscript

Quantitative PCR showed that HOTAIR is overexpressed from hundreds to nearly two
thousand- fold in breast cancer metastases, and HOTAIR level is sometimes high but
heterogeneous among primary tumors (Fig. 1c). We next measured HOTAIR level in an
independent panel of 132 primary breast tumors (stage I and II) with extensive clinical
follow-up13. Indeed, nearly one third of primary breast tumors overexpress HOTAIR by
over 125-fold over normal breast epithelia, the minimum level of HOTAIR overexpression
observed in bona fide metastases (Fig. 1d), and high HOTAIR level is a significant predictor
of subsequent metastasis and death (p=0.0004 and p=0.005 for metastasis and death,
respectively, Fig. 1e, f). Multivariate analysis showed that prognostic stratification of
metastasis and death by HOTAIR is independent of known clinical risk factors such as
tumor size, stage, and hormone receptor status (Supplementary Table 2).

Author Manuscript

We next examined the effects of manipulating HOTAIR level in several breast cancer cell
lines. HOTAIR levels in cell lines are significantly lower than those seen in primary or
metastatic breast tumors (Supplementary Fig. 3, 4). Retroviral transduction allowed stable
overexpression of HOTAIR to several hundred fold over vector-transduced cells, which are
comparable to levels observed in patients (Supplementary Fig. 4). HOTAIR overexpression
promoted colony growth in soft agar (Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, enforced
expression of HOTAIR in four different breast cancer cell lines increased cancer cell
invasion through Matrigel, a basement-membrane like extracellular matrix, (Fig. 2a).
Conversely, depletion of HOTAIR by small inferring RNAs (siRNAs) in MCF7, a cell line

that expresses endogenous HOTAIR, decreased its matrix invasiveness (Fig. 2b and
Supplementary Fig. 6). To probe the effects of HOTAIR on cancer cell dynamics in vivo, we
labeled control and HOTAIR-expressing cells with firefly luciferase, enabling in vivo
bioluminescence imaging. When MDA-MB-231 cells expressing vector or HOTAIR were
orthotopically grafted into mammary fat pads, serial imaging showed that HOTAIR
expression modestly increased the rate of primary tumor growth (Fig. 2C, left panel).
Importantly, in the same animals, we observed significantly increased foci of luciferase
signal in the lung fields of mice bearing HOTAIR+ primary tumors (Fig. 2C, right panel),
which suggests that HOTAIR promotes lung metastasis.

Author Manuscript

To further quantify metastatic potential in vivo, we performed tail vein xenografts and
compared the rates of lung colonization. Vector expression in the non-metastatic cell line
SK-BR3 never showed lung colonization after tail vein xenograft (0 of 15 mice), but
HOTAIR expression allowed SK-BR3 cells to colonize the lung in 80% of animals (12 of 15
mice, Fig. 2C). SK-BR3 cells apparently lack additional genetic elements required to persist
in the lung, because HOTAIR-transduced SK-BR3 cells in the lung disappeared after
approximately one week. In contrast, HOTAIR expression in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted
in approximately eight-to ten- fold more cells to engraft the lung after tail vein xenograft
(Fig. 2D). These differences persisted until the end of the experiment, resulting in ten-fold
more lung metastases as verified by histology (p= 0.00005, Fig. 2E). The tumors retained
HOTAIR expression for the length of the experiment (Supplementary Fig. 7).

We next tested if HOTAIR overexpression affected the pattern of PRC2 occupancy. We
mapped PRC2 occupancy genome-wide by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by
hybridization to tiling microarrays interrogating all human promoters (ChIP-chip, Fig. 3).
Compared to vector expressing cells, HOTAIR overexpression induced localization of
H3K27me3 and PRC2 subunits SUZ12, EZH2, on 854 new genes while concomitantly
losing PRC2 occupancy and H3K27me3 on 37 genes (Fig. 3a). A significant fraction of
these 854 genes also showed consequent changes in gene expression after HOTAIR overexpression (39% observed vs. 7.0% expected by chance alone, p = 2.5 ×10−209,
hypergeometric distribution). The majority of PRC2 occupancy sites on promoters genomewide showed little change (data not shown), and HOTAIR overexpression did not change
the levels of PRC2 subunits (Fig. 4a, lane 1 vs. lane 4). A number of the genes with
HOTAIR-induced PRC2 occupancy are implicated in inhibiting breast cancer progression,
including transcription factors HOXD1014 and PRG1, encoding progesterone receptor (a
classic favorable prognostic factor); cell adhesion molecules of the protocadherin (PCDH)
gene family15 and JAM216; and EPHA117,18, encoding an ephrin receptor involved in
tumor angiogenesis. Gene Ontology19 analysis suggested a majority of the 854 genes are
involved in pathways related to cell-cell signaling and development (Supplementary Fig. 8).
HOTAIR-induced PRC2 occupancy tended to spread over promoters, and to a lesser extent,
gene bodies (Fig. 3b). HOTAIR may also induce PRC2 localization to other intergenic
regions not present on our tiling arrays. ChIP followed by quantitative PCR confirmed that
HOTAIR substantially increased PRC2 occupancy and H3K27me3 of all target genes
examined (Supplementary Fig. 9). Notably, like HOTAIR itself, the 854 HOTAIR-PRC2

target genes are coordinately down regulated in aggressive breast tumors that tend to cause
death (p<0.0003, Supplementary Fig. 10).

Author Manuscript

We next compared the 854 genes with HOTAIR-induced PRC2 occupancy in MDAMB-231 cells with a compendium of published PRC2 occupancy profiles in diverse cell
types (Fig. 3c). PRC2 occupancy patterns from different cancer, fibroblastic, and embryonic
stem cell lines were annotated from existing databases (Supplementary Table 3). Using a
pattern matching algorithm20, we found that the HOTAIR-induced PRC2 occupancy pattern
in breast cancer cells most resembled the endogenous PRC2 occupancy pattern in embryonic
and neonatal fibroblasts, especially fibroblasts derived from posterior and distal anatomic
sites where endogenous HOTAIR is expressed7 (p<10−50 for each comparison, FDR≪0.05,
Fig. 3c). These 854 genes are also significantly enriched for genes in primary fibroblasts that
are bound by PRC2 in a HOTAIR dependent manner (32% overlap observed vs. 9.9%
expected by chance alone, p = 8.5 ×10−93, hypergeometric distribution, M.C.T., unpublished
data). These results suggest that elevated HOTAIR expression in breast cancer cells appears
to reprogram the Polycomb binding profile of a breast epithelial cell to that of an embryonic
fibroblast.

Finally, we addressed whether the ability of HOTAIR to induce breast cancer invasiveness
required an intact PRC2 complex. We transduced vector- or HOTAIR-expressing MDAMB-231 cells with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting PRC2 subunits EZH2 or SUZ12.
Immunoblot analyses confirmed efficient depletion of the targeted proteins (Fig. 4a).
Depletion of either SUZ12 or EZH2 had little impact on the invasiveness of control cells,
but completely reversed the ability of HOTAIR to promote matrix invasion (Fig. 4b).
Depletion of EZH2 also inhibited HOTAIR-driven lung colonization after tail vein xenograft
by approximately 50% (p < 0.05). These results suggest that PRC2 is specifically required
for HOTAIR to promote cellular invasiveness. Global gene expression analysis revealed
hundreds of genes that were induced or repressed as a consequence of HOTAIR
overexpression (Fig. 4c, left panel). Importantly, concomitant depletion of PRC2 in large
part reversed the global gene expression pattern to that of cells not overexpressing HOTAIR
(Fig. 4c, right panel). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that HOTAIR-induced PRC2 target
genes, such as JAM2, PCDH10, PCDHB5, were transcriptionally repressed upon HOTAIR
expression and de-repressed upon concomitant PRC2 depletion (Fig. 4d). HOTAIR-induced
genes were also reversed upon PRC2 depletion (Fig. 4d). Of note, many of the genes
induced by HOTAIR are known positive regulators of cancer metastasis, including ABL221,
SNAIL22, and laminins23. Conversely, overexpression of EZH2 in H16N2 breast cells is
known to promote matrix invasion10, but concomitant depletion of endogenous HOTAIR in
large measure inhibited the ability of EZH2 to induce matrix invasion (Fig. 4e and
Supplementary Figure 6). Together, these results demonstrate a functional inter-dependency
between HOTAIR and PRC2 in promoting cancer invasiveness.
In summary, the cancer transcriptome is more complex than previously believed. In addition
to protein coding genes and microRNAs, dysregulated expression of lincRNAs is likely
pervasive in human cancers and can drive cancer development and progression. Notably, the
lincRNA HOTAIR regulates metastatic progression. HOTAIR recruits PRC2 complex to
specific targets genes genome-wide, leading to H3K27 trimethylation and epigenetic

silencing of metastasis suppressor genes (Fig. 4f). The concept of epigenomic
reprogramming by lincRNAs may also be applicable to many other human disease states
characterized by aberrant lincRNA expression and chromatin states. HOTAIR is normally
involved in specifying the chromatin state associated with fibroblasts from anatomically
posterior and distal sites. Within the context of cancer cells, ectopic expression of HOTAIR
appear to re-impose that chromatin state, thereby enabling gene expression programs that are
conducive to cell motility and matrix invasion.

Author Manuscript

The interdependence between HOTAIR and PRC2 has therapeutic implications. High levels
of HOTAIR may identify tumors that are sensitive to small molecules inhibitors of PRC224.
Conversely, tumors that overexpress Polycomb proteins may be sensitive to therapeutic
strategies that target endogenous HOTAIR or inhibit HOTAIR-PRC2 interactions.
Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms by which HOTAIR regulates PRC2 will
be a critical first step in exploring these potential new avenues in cancer therapy.

METHODS SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Human materials were obtained from Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Netherlands Cancer
Institute. Expression of HOX transcripts was determined using ultra-high density HOX tiling
arrays7 and qRT-PCR. Kaplan-Meier analyses of breast cancer patients were as described13.
We used retroviral transduction to overexpress HOTAIR and luciferase, and used siRNA or
shRNA to deplete the indicated transcripts. Matrix invasion was measured by the transwell
Matrigel assay. We implanted cells in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice, and monitored
primary tumor growth and lung metastasis by bioluminescence. Cells were injected into the
tail vein of nude mice, and lungs were analyzed at 9 weeks to quantify lung colonization in
vivo. ChIP-chip was performed as described7 using human whole genome promoter tiling
arrays (Roche Nimblegen, Wisconsin). Module map and GO enrichment analyses were done
using Genomica20.

METHODS
Reagents

Author Manuscript

The MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3, MCF-10A, MCF-7, HCC1954, T47D, and MDA-MB-453
cell lines were obtained from ATCC. The H16N2 cell line was a gift from V. Band
(University of Nebraska medical center). pLZRS, pLZRS-luciferase and pSuper Retro –
shGFP, -shSUZ12, and –shEZH225 were obtained from P. Khavari (Stanford University).
pLZRS-HOTAIR and pLZRS-EZH2-Flag were constructed by subcloning the full-length
human HOTAIR7 or Flag-EZH2-ER fusion protein [representing amino acids 1–751 of
EZH2 fused with the murine estrogen receptor (amino acids 281–599)] into pLZRS using
the gateway cloning system (Invitrogen).

placed into suspension by this method; they were then isolated by serial filtration. Samples
were treated with TRIzol and RNA extracted.
Fresh frozen primary breast tumor specimens were obtained from the Department of
Pathology breast tumor bank; specimens were all from patients 45–55 years of age, with
estrogen receptor expression by immunohistochemistry as performed during routine tumor
staging at diagnosis, for uniformity of samples.

Author Manuscript

Metastatic breast carcinoma samples were obtained from the Rapid Autopsy Program at
Johns Hopkins Hospital27. All specimens were snap frozen at time of autopsy and stored at
−80 degrees. Twenty 20-micron sections were obtained from metastasis to the liver (for
uniformity of samples) and embedded in OCT. These slices were macerated by use of the
BioMasher centrifugal sample preparation device (Cartagen), with 350 uL of lysis buffer
from the Qiagen RNEasy Mini Extraction kit. RNA extraction was completed with the flowthrough from the BioMasher, as per the commercial protocol.
HOTAIR Expression and Survival/Metastasis Analysis of Primary Breast Tumors

Author Manuscript

The database of 295 breast cancer patients from the Netherlands Cancer Institute with
detailed clinical and gene expression data was used 13. Clinical data are available at http://
microarray-pubs.stanford.edu/wound_NKI, www.rii.com/publications, or http://
microarrays.nki.nl. RNA from 132 primary breast tumors from the NKI 295 cohort was
isolated along with RNA from normal breast organoid cultures (n=6). HOTAIR and
GAPDH were measured by qRT-PCR. HOTAIR values were normalized to GAPDH and
expressed relative to pooled normal HOTAIR RNA levels. For both univariate and
multivariate analysis, the expression of HOTAIR was treated as a binary variable divided
into “high” and “low” HOTAIR expression. To determine the criteria for “high” HOTAIR
expression, the minimum relative level of HOTAIR seen in six metastatic breast cancer
samples (see Fig. 1c and accompanying methods) was determined (≥ 125 above normal). By
this criteria, 44 of 132 primary breast tumors were categorized as “high” and 88 of 132
tumors were labeled as “low”. For statistical analysis, overall survival was defined by death
from any cause. Distant metastasis-free probability was defined by a distant metastasis as
the first recurrence event. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the Cox-Mantel
log-rank test in Winstat (R. Fitch Software). Multivariate analysis by the Cox proportional
hazard method was done using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS, Inc.)
RNA expression analysis

Author Manuscript

qRT-PCR—Total RNA from cells was extracted using TRIzol and the RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen). RNA levels (starting with 50–100 ng per reaction) for a specific gene (primer set
sequences listed in Supplementary Table S4) was measured using the Brilliant SYBR Green
II qRT-PCR kit (Strategene) according to manufacturer instructions. All samples were
normalized to GAPDH.
HOX tiling array—RNA samples (Primary or Metastatic breast carcinoma in channel in
Cy5 channel and normal breast organoid RNA representing a pool of six unique samples in
Cy3 channel) were labeled and hybridized to a custom human HOX tiling array with 50 base

pair resolution (Roche Nimblegen) as described7. For each sample, RMA normalized
intensity values for previously defined peaks encoding HOX coding gene exons (as defined
in version HG17) and HOX lincRNAs (as defined by Rinn et al.7) were determined relative
to normal. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed by CLUSTER28.
Microarray—Total RNA from cells was extracted using TRIzol and the RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen) and hybridized to Stanford human oligonucleotide (HEEBO) arrays as
described29. Data analysis was done using CLUSTER28.
Gene Transfer Experiments

Author Manuscript

Retrovirus was generated using amphotrophic phoenix cells and used to infect target cells as
described30. For LZRS vector, HOTAIR, and EZH2-ER, and firefly luciferase no further
selection was done post-infection. For pRetro-Super -shGFP, -shSUZ12, and shEZH2, target
cells were selected using puromycin (0.5 μg/ml). Many of the epigenetic changes due to
HOTAIR expression were only seen after several cell passages; thus all experiments postHOTAIR transduction were done after passage 10.
Nonradioactive ISH of Paraffin Sections

Author Manuscript

Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled sense and antisense RNA probes were generated by PCR
amplification of T7 promoter incorporated into the primers. In vitro transcription was
performed with DIG RNA labeling kit and T7 polymerase according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Sections (5 um thick) were cut from
the paraffin blocks, deparaffinized in xylene, and hydrated in graded concentrations of
ethanol for 5 min each. Sections were incubated with 1% hydrogen peroxide, followed by
digestion in 10 ug/ml of proteinase K at 37C for 30 min. Sections were hybridized overnight
at 55C with either sense or antisense riboprobes at 200 ng/ml dilution in mRNA
hybridization buffer (Chemicon). The following day, sections were washed in 2xSSC and
incubated with 1:35 dilution of RNase A cocktail (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) in 2xSSC for
30 min at 37C. Next, sections were stringently washed in 2xSSC/50% formamide twice,
followed by one wash at 0.08xSSC at 55C. Biotin-blocking reagents (Dako) were applied to
the section to block the endogenous biotin. For signal amplification, a horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-DIG antibody (Roche) was used to catalyze the
deposition of biotinyl-tyramide, followed by secondary streptavidin complex (GenPoint kit;
Dako). The final signal was developed with DAB(GenPoint kit; Dako), and the tissues were
counterstained in hematoxylin for 30s.
RNA Interference

Author Manuscript

RNA interference for HOTAIR was done as described7. Briefly, cells were transfected with
50 nM of siRNAs targeting HOTAIR (siHOTAIR #1 GAACGGGAGUACAGAGAGAUU;
#2 CCACAUGAACGCCCAGAGAUU; #3 UAACAAGACCAGAGAGCUGUU) or siGFP
(CUACAACAGCCACAACGUCdTdT) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per the
manufacturer’s direction. Total RNA was harvested for total RNA 72 hr later for qRT-PCR
analysis.

RNA interference of EZH2 and SUZ12 was done by infecting target cells with retrovirus
expressing shEZH2, shSUZ12, and shGFP as described25. To confirm knock-down, protein
lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis as described30
using SUZ12 (Abcam), anti-EZH2 (Upstate), and anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz).
Matrigel Invasion Assay and Cell Proliferation Assay

Author Manuscript

The matrigel invasion assay was done using the Biocoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber from
Becton Dickson according to manufacturer protocol. Briefly, 5 × 104 cells were plated in the
upper chamber in serum free media. The bottom chamber contained DMEM media with
10% FBS. Following 24–48 hrs, the bottom of the chamber insert was fixed and stained with
Diff-Quick stain. Cells on the stained membrane were counted under a dissecting
microscope. Each membrane was divided into four quadrants and an average from all four
quadrants was calculated. Each matrigel invasion assay was at least done in biological
triplicates. For invasion assays in the H16N2 cell line using EZH2-ER, all experiments (both
vector and with EZH2-ER) were done in the presence of 500 nM estradiol.
For cell proliferation assays, 1×103 cells were plated in quadruplicate in 96 well plates and
cell number was calculated using the MTT assay (Roche).
Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay

Author Manuscript

Soft Agar Assays were constructed in 6-well plates. The base layer of each well consisted of
2mL with final concentrations of 1x media (RPMI (HCC1954), McCoy’s Media (SKBR3),
or DMEM (MDA-MB-231) + 10% or 2% Heat-Inactivated FBS (Invitrogen)) and 0.6% low
melting point agarose. Plates were chilled at 4°C until solid. Upon this, a 1 ml growth agar
layer was poured, consisting of 1 × 104 cells (either infected with LZRS-HOTAIR or LZRS
vector as described above) suspended in 1X media and 0.3% low melting point agarose.
Plates were again chilled at 4°C until the growth layer congealed. An additional 1 mL of 1X
media without agarose was added on top of the growth layer on day 0 and again on day 14
of growth. Cells were allowed to grow at 37°C for 1 month and total colonies counted (>200
micron in diameter for MDA-MB-231; >50 micron in diameter for HCC1954 and SKBR3).
Assays were repeated a total of 3 times. Results were statistically analyzed by paired T-test
using the PRISM Graphpad program.
Mammary Fat Pad Xenografts

Author Manuscript

Six week old female SCID Beige mice were purchased from Charles River laboratories
(Wilmington, MA), housed at the animal care facility at Stanford University Medical Center
(Stanford, CA) and kept under standard temperature, humidity, and timed lighting
conditions and provided mouse chow and water ad libitum. MDA-MB-231-Luc or MDAMB-231-Luc tumor cells transduced with HOTAIR were injected directly into the mammary
fat pad of the mice semi-orthotopically (n=10 each) in 0.05mL of sterile DMEM (2,500,000
cells/animal).
Mouse Tail-Vein Assay
Female athymic nude mice were used. 2.5 × 106 MDA-MB-231 HOTAIR-luciferase or
VECTOR-luciferase cells in 0.2 mL PBS were injected via the tail vein into individual mice

(18 for each cell line). Mice were observed generally for signs of illness weekly for the
length of the experiment. The lungs were excised and weighed fresh, then bisected. Half was
fixed in formalin overnight then embedded in paraffin, from which sections were made and
H&E stained by our pathology consultation service. These slides were examined for the
presence of micrometastases, which were counted in 3 low power (5x) fields per specimen.
The other half of the tumor was fast-frozen into OCT and stored at -80°C. RNA was
extracted by the TRIzol protocol from 10 sections, 20 microns thick each, obtained from the
frozen sections. RT-PCR confirmed expression of HOTAIR RNA in lungs bearing
micrometastases of MDA-MB-231 HOTAIR cells at the end of the experiment.
Bioluminescence Imaging

Author Manuscript

Mice received luciferin (300 mg/kg, 10 minutes prior to imaging) and were anesthetized
(3% isoflurane) and imaged in an IVIS spectrum imaging system (Xenogen, part of Caliper
Life Sciences). Images were analyzed with Living Image software (Xenogen, part of Caliper
Life Sciences). Bioluminescent flux (Photons/sec/sr/cm2) was determined for the primary
tumors or lungs (upper abdomen region of interest).
ChIP-chip

Author Manuscript

ChIP-chip experiments were done as previously described7. Each experiment was done in
biological triplicate. The following antibodies were used: anti-H3K27me3 (Abcam), antiSUZ12 (Abcam) and anti-EZH2 (Upstate). Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified using
the Whole Genome Amplification kit (Sigma) based on the manufacturers protocol.
Amplified and labeled DNA was hybridized to the HG18 whole genome two array promoter
set from Roche Nimblegen. Probe labeling, hybridization, and data extraction and analysis
was performed using Roche Nimblegen protocols. The relative ratio of HOTAIR over vector
was calculated for each promoter peak by extracting the normalized (over input) intensity
values for promoter peaks showing peaks with an FDR score ≤0.2 in either vector or
HOTAIR cells. These values were weighted to determine the significance of the relative
ratio: using Cluster 28, only those promoters with a consistent relative ratio (HOTAIR/
vector) ≥1.5 fold or ≤0.5 fold in two out of the three ChIP were selected and displayed in
TreeView. Selected ChIP –chip results were confirmed by PCR using the Lightcycler 480
SYBR Green I kit (see Supplementary Table S5 for primer sequences).
TaqMan® real-time PCR assays

Author Manuscript

A panel of 96 TaqMan® real-time PCR HOX assays (Supplementary Table 6) was
developed targeting 43 HOX lincRNAs and 39 HOX transcription factors across the four
HOX loci. Two housekeeping genes (ACTB and PPIA) were also included in this panel in
triplicates as endogenous controls for normalization between samples. The transcript
specificity and genome specificity of all TaqMan assays were verified using a position
specific alignment matrix to predict potential cross-reactivity between designed assays and
genome-wide non-target transcripts or genomic sequences. Using this HOX assay panel we
profiled 88 total RNA samples from a cohort of five normal breast organoids, seventy-eight
primary breast tumors (from the NKI 295 cohort) and five metastatic breast tumors. cDNAs
were generated from 30ng of total RNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA). The resulting cDNA was subjected

manufacturer’s TaqMan® PreAmp Master Mix Kit Protocol (Life Technologies, Foster
City, CA). Four replicates were run for each gene for each sample in a 384-well format plate
on 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA). Between the
two measured endogenous control genes (PPIA and ACTB), we chose PPIA for
normalization across different samples based on the fact that this gene showed the most
relatively constant expression in different breast carcinomas (data not shown).
Gene Set Analysis

Author Manuscript

For gene set enrichment analysis, gene sets from fifteen different H3K27, SUZ12, or EZH2
global occupancy lists from the indicated cell lineages were procured (see Supplementary
Table S3 for references and platforms). Pattern matching between the 854 gene set with
increased PRC2 occupancy (Supplementary Table S7) and these fifteen gene sets were
visualized using CLUSTER and TreeView. The significance of enrichment between these
gene sets was calculated using module map analysis implemented in Genomica20 (corrected
for multiple hypotheses using FDR).
