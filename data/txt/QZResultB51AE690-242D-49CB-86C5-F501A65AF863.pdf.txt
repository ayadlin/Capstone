ABSTRACT
Historically, understanding of acquired resistance (AQR) to combination
treatment has been based on knowledge of resistance to its component agents. To
test whether an altered drug interaction could be an additional factor in AQR to
combination treatment, models of AQR to combination and single agent MEK and
PI3K inhibitor treatment were generated. Combination indices indicated combination
treatment of PI3K and MEK inhibitors remained synergistic in cells with AQR to single
agent but not combination AQR cells. Differences were also observed between the
models in cellular phenotypes, pathway signaling and drug cross-resistance. Genomics
implicated TGFB2-EDN1 overexpression as candidate determinants in models of
AQR to combination treatment. Supplementation of endothelin in parental cells
converted synergism to antagonism. Silencing of TGFB2 or EDN1 in cells with AQR
conferred synergy between PI3K and MEK inhibitor. These results highlight that AQR
to combination treatment may develop through alternative mechanisms to those of
single agent treatment, including a change in drug interaction.

INTRODUCTION

identified, including changes in drug efflux, metabolism
and detoxification, and acquired DNA mutations, gene
amplification, pathway redundancy, crosstalk and
feedback, and the enrichment of resistant subclones [3].
In recent times, the emergence of moleculartargeted therapy has led to an increased consideration of
combination therapy as a means of circumventing drug
resistance. However, AQR to combination therapy can
still be expected, with evidence readily available from
the clinic. What is unclear is whether mechanisms of
AQR to combination therapy are the same as those for
monotherapy, and whether an altered drug interaction
could also be a factor. In this study, models of AQR to
the prominent combination of MEK and PI3K inhibitors
[4–9] were generated concurrently with models to single
agent treatment. Selective loss of synergy in combination
treatment was observed in the cells with AQR to

Combination therapy, entailing treatment using
two or more agents together, has become a common
strategy for optimizing treatment efficacy, and reducing
toxicity and drug resistance [1]. The strategy is based
on the principle that an additional effect is generated by
combining agents over using them individually. These
effects can be synergistic, additive, or antagonistic, namely
greater than, equal to, or worse than the added effects of
the component agents respectively.
Drug resistance remains a major cause of treatment
failure [2]. The resistance can be due to intrinsic factors
that manifest in a lack of initial drug activity. Resistance
can also be acquired, developing as a result of changes
induced by the selection pressure of drug treatment. Many
mechanisms of acquired resistance (AQR) have been

combination treatment but not single agent treatment,
presenting loss of synergy as a novel mechanism of
AQR to be considered in the application of combination
therapy.

Analysis of baseline p-Erk, p-Akt, p-S6 and
p-4EBP1 revealed HCT116AR cells had higher levels of
p-Erk than HCT116DM cells (Figure 1), consistent with a
previous report [11]. HCT116BR cells had elevated p-Erk
and p-Akt. HCT116CR cells also had increased p-Erk and
p-Akt, but also reduced p-4EBP1.
Following
combination
treatment,
p-Erk,
p-Akt, p-S6 and p-4EBP1  were reduced in all cells,
indicating pathway inhibition activity was retained.
AZD6244 treatment also reduced p-Erk in all cells, and
BKM120 treatment reduced p-Akt in all cells, indicating
that the inhibitory activity of single agents was retained
as well. BKM120 also reduced p-4EBP1 in HCT116CR
and HCT116AR but not HCT116BR cells, suggesting the
AQR of HCT116BR cells to PI3K inhibition could involve
reduced p-4EBP1 inhibition. AZD6244 also significantly
reduced p-Akt, and p-4EBP1 (not statistically significant;
p = 0.06) in HCT116CR but not the other cells.

RESULTS
Generation of AQR and loss of synergy
HCT116 cells with KRAS G13D and PIK3CA
H1047R mutations (cancer.sanger.ac.uk) were cultured
in the presence of both AZD6244 (MEK inhibitor) and
BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor) at IC50 concentrations of
each agent, AZD6244 alone (2 treatments of ½ IC50
concentrations), BKM120 alone (2  treatments of ½
IC50 concentrations), or vehicle (2 treatments of 0.25%
DMSO). Two treatments were provided for all models
to minimize bias from the number of treatments of the
cells.
After prolonged treatment, HCT116 cells cultured
with both AZD6244 and BKM120 became resistant
to combination AZD6244 and BKM120  treatment
(designated as “HCT116CR” cells) compared to
HCT116 cells cultured with DMSO (“HCT116DM”
cells) (Table  1). Combination index (CI) analysis [10]
indicated that AZD6244 and BKM120 were antagonistic
in HCT116CR cells, while they were synergistic in
HCT116DM cells. HCT116CR cells also displayed
increased resistance to single agent treatment with
AZD6244, but not BKM120.
HCT116 cells treated with AZD6244 alone
(“HCT116AR” cells) and BKM120 alone (“HCT116BR”
cells) displayed AQR to their respective treatments. Crossresistance was observed for HCT116AR cells to BKM120,
as well as for HCT116BR cells to AZD6244. Nonetheless,
the combination of AZD6244 and BKM120  remained
synergistic in HCT116AR and HCT116BR cells.
To confirm that the AQR and loss of synergy was
not compound specific, the sensitivity of the cells to
GDC0973 (MEK inhibitor) and BYL719 (PI3K inhibitor)
treatment was assessed. Similar patterns of AQR, crossresistance and loss of synergy was observed with these
agents in respective cells (Table 1). The only difference
in pattern was an increased resistance of HCT116CR cells
to BYL719.
To confirm that the observations were not specific
to HCT116 cells, LoVo (KRAS G13D mutant, cancer.
sanger.ac.uk) colorectal cancer cells with AQR to
AZD6244 (“LoVoAR”), BKM120 (“LoVoBR”) and
their combination (“LoVoCR”) were generated using
the same methods applied to HCT116 cells. The cells
exhibited similar patterns of resistance to AZD6244
and BKM120  treatment, as well as GCD0973 and
BYL719  treatment, as observed for HCT116 cells
(Supplementary Table S1).

Cell phenotype analysis
Consistent with their known activity [12, 13], single
agent AZD6244 and BKM120 treatment led to increased
G1 phase populations, and combination treatment led to an
increased sub-G1 population and apoptosis in HCT116DM
cells (Figure  2). In HCT116AR and HCT116BR cells,
the increase in G1 phase populations was not observed
following single agent treatment. However, combination
treatment still led to an increased sub-G1 population
and apoptosis in these cells. In HCT116CR cells, there
was no significant increase in G1 or sub-G1 populations
or apoptosis following single agent and combination
treatment (Supplementary Figure S1). Indeed, apoptosis
after combination treatment was significantly reduced
in HCT116CR cells compared to HCT116DM cells. In
wound healing experiments, HCT116AR, HCT116BR
and HCT116CR cells displayed increased migration
compared to HCT116DM cells when treated with DMSO.
Combination treatment led to a reduction in migration
of HCT116DM, HCT116AR and HCT116BR, but not
HCT116CR cells.

Drug cross-resistance analysis
No significant differences were observed in the
sensitivity of HCT116-derived cells to 5-Fluorouracil,
carboplatin and sorafenib, suggesting that a multi-drug
resistance phenotype was not responsible for resistance
(Supplementary Table  S2). Consistent with the earlier
observations, HCT116AR, HCT116BR and HCT116CR
cells were more resistant than HCT116DM cells to an
extended panel of MEK and PI3K inhibitors. Interestingly,
HCT116CR cells also exhibited sensitivity to Akt and

SMAD activation [15, 16]. No changes in the expression
of EDN1 and TGFB2 were observed in the single agent
AQR cells, and expression of endothelin receptors also
remained unchanged in both the combination AQR cells
compared to parental cells (Supplementary Figure S4).

mTOR inhibitors. HCT116BR cells shared sensitivity with
HCT116CR cells to Akt inhibitors. HCT116AR cells were
more resistant to mTOR inhibitors.

In vivo assessment
HCT116CR and HCT116DM cells were implanted
in male SCID mice as described in Methods. Treatments
started when the tumors reached the size of approximately
130–150  mm3, and consisted of either treatment with
vehicle or the combination of AZD6244 (25 mg/kg) and
BKM120 (40 mg/kg) daily. Treatment ceased after 10 days
when the tumors in the mice treated with vehicle reached
their maximum allowed tumor volume. Consistent with
the treatment synergy observed in-vitro, HCT116DM
tumor growth was significantly inhibited by treatment with
the combination compared to vehicle (p = 0.01, Figure 2).
Consistent with the AQR observed in-vitro, combination
treatment reduced tumor growth less in HCT116CR
than HCT116DM tumors, however the difference was
not statistically significant. After treatment withdrawal,
tumors from mice receiving combination treatment were
measured for an additional 10 days. Tumors from mice
implanted with HCT116CR cells grew at a faster rate than
those implanted with HCT116DM cells (p = 0.03).

Modulation of EDN1 and TGFB2
To investigate the involvement of EDN1 in drug
resistance, parental HCT116 were cultured with 100 nM
endothelin-1 or with vehicle for 24 hours before treatment
with the combination of AZD6244 and BKM120. The two
drugs were antagonistic in cells cultured with endothelin-1
(CIfu0.5  =  1.9  ±  0.05) while they were synergistic in
HCT116 cells cultured with vehicle (0.19 ± 0.02). Cells
cultured with endothelin-1 also had higher p-Akt, p-Erk
and p-4EBP1  levels than those cultured with vehicle
(Figure 3).
HCT116 and HCT116CR cells were also transfected
with EDN1 and TGFB2 siRNA, and confirmed to have
reduced EDN1 and TGFB2 RNA levels respectively
compared to cells transfected with scramble siRNA.
TGFB2 siRNA transfection also reduced EDN1 RNA
levels, while EDN1 siRNA transfection did not reduce
TGFB2 RNA levels, consistent with TGFB2 being a
upstream regulator of EDN1 [15,  16]. Transfection of
EDN1 siRNA in HCT116CR cells led to synergism
between AZD6244 and BKM120 (0.52  ±  0.03), while
antagonism remained in cells transfected with scrambled
siRNA (2.1 ± 0.05). In parental HCT116 cells, the two
drugs remained synergistic whether transfected with EDN1
siRNA (0.25 ± 0.04) or scrambled siRNA (0.22 ± 0.02).
Similarly, transfection with TGFB2 siRNA (0.62 ± 0.08)
but not scrambled siRNA (1.9  ±  0.07) also converted
antagonism to synergism in HCT116CR cells. There was
also no change in the synergism of combination treatment
from the transfection of TGFB2 siRNA (0.49 ± 0.06) or
scramble siRNA (0.32 ± 0.05) in HCT116 cells. EDN1
and TGFB2 siRNA also both reduced the levels of p-Akt
and p-Erk in HCT116CR cells, but not HCT116 cells. The
same results were observed from endothelin-1 and siRNA
priming of LoVo-derived cells (Supplementary Figure S5).
Additionally, synergy between PI3K and MEK inhibitors
was also restored in HCT116CR (CI@fu0.5 = 0.53 ± 0.02,
p < 0.05) and LoVoCR (CI@fu0.5 = 0.61 ± 0.04, p < 0.05)
cells in the presence of a fixed-low growth inhibitory
concentration (5% growth inhibition) of bosentan, a dual
endothelin receptor antagonist (Supplementary Figure S6).

DNA variant analysis
All 8 cells were screened for DNA variants in 50
prominent genes in cancer using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer
Hotspot Panel v2. The average depth of sequencing was
3,792 ± 424 reads and uniformity of base coverage was
98.53 ± 0.01% (Supplementary Table S3). All variants in
HCT116 and LoVo cells that were expected to be detected
according to previous reports [14] and assay design
were detected. Four additional variants were detected:
SMAD4  (Y412H) in HCT116AR, TP53  (T18A) and
TP53  (Y236C) in HCT116CR, and PTEN (A126S) in
LoVoDM cells.

RNA expression analysis
Using gene expression arrays, eleven probes were
differentially expressed (adjusted p <  0.01 and foldchange  >  1.5) and consistent between HCT116CR and
LoVoCR cells compared to the others (Supplementary
Figure  S2). Endothelin-1 (EDN1) and transforming
growth factor beta 2 (TGFB2) had the highest differential
expression (3.84 and 3.94 higher in CR cells respectively),
of which the p-value was lowest for EDN1 (1.22 × 10–9
and 2.44 × 10–6 respectively). The significant difference
in EDN1 and TGFB2 expression between CR and DM
cells was verified by real-time PCR (Figure 3B and 3C)
and western immunoblotting in both HCT116- and LoVoderived cells (Supplementary Figure S3). The increased
expression of both TGFB2 and EDN1 was of particular

DISCUSSION
During the execution of this study, two controlled
studies of AQR to combination treatment were reported.
Ahronian et al. described AQR to combination BRAF and
MEK inhibitor treatment in melanoma cells in-vitro that
29191

was associated with acquisition of KRAS amplification
[17]. KRAS amplification was also observed in a tumor at
recurrence in a melanoma patient treated with combination
BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy. Pirazolli et al. reported
on AQR to combination afatinib and cetuximab treatment
in EGFR-mutant lung cancer in-vitro and in-vivo that was
linked to acquisition of mTOR activation [18]. Similar
resistance and aberration was observed in a lung cancer
patient treated with afatinib and cetuximab.
A major element in the consideration of combination
therapy however, is the effect of the drug interaction, be
it synergistic, additive or antagonistic [19]. Traditionally,
this interaction has been measured by the protocol of
Chou and Talalay [19]. The protocol allows calculation
of a CI value derived from IC50 values of respective drugs
at fixed ratios over a concentration range. Through this

approach, the nature of interaction of combined drugs
can be quantified, and misinterpretation of “one-sided”
enhancement as synergy can be avoided.
The primary hypothesis of this study was that
an altered drug interaction could have a role in AQR to
combination therapy, based on the rationale that drug
interaction can be a determinant of combination treatment
efficacy. To test this hypothesis, models of AQR to either
the combination of AZD6244 and BKM120 (HCT116CR),
AZD6244 alone (HCT116AR), or BKM120 alone
(HCT116BR) were generated through prolonged treatment,
along with cells treated with DMSO vehicle (HCT116DM).
In support of the hypothesis, CI values revealed the
combination of AZD6244 and BKM120 was antagonistic
in HCT116CR cells, while it remained synergistic in
HCT116DM cells (Table 1). Combination treatment also

remained synergistic in HCT116AR and HCT116BR cells,
indicating that the loss of synergy was a specific feature of
AQR in HCT116CR cells. In addition, pathway signaling
analysis revealed that both single agent and combination
treatment continued to inhibit expected targets in all
cells. This suggested that factors other than loss of direct
inhibitory activity were involved in the resistance.
Numerous measures were included in this study to
support the validity of the loss of synergy. For single agent
treatment, two doses of drugs at ½ IC50 concentrations were
used to provide consistency with combination treatment
in the number of drug aliquots. Cells with prolonged
vehicle treatment were used to control for the effects of
treatment over time. Cells were treated with alternative
MEK (GDC0973) and PI3K (BYL719) inhibitors and
similar trends were observed (Table 1), supporting that
the observations were not compound specific. Parallel
lines of LoVo cells were generated and similar patterns
of resistance were observed in these cells (Supplementary
Table S1), indicating that the observations were also not
cell line specific. Lastly, tumor xenografts confirmed the
resistance phenotype in-vivo (Figure 2).
Many other differences between AQR to
combination and single agent treatment were revealed
by the study design. Phosphorylation of 4EBP1  was
uniquely reduced, and AZD6244  treatment reduced
p-Akt and p-4EBP1 in HCT116CR cells but not others
(Figure 1). In addition to reduced G1 arrest observed in
HCT116AR, HCT116BR and HCT116CR cells, apoptosis
was reduced in HCT116CR cells following combination
treatment (Figure  2). Cell migration was less impeded
by combination treatment in HCT116CR cells compared
to all other cells. While HCT116AR cells were more
resistant to mTOR inhibitors, HCT116CR cells were more
sensitive. These additional phenotypes caution against the
assumption that resistance to combination treatment is a
composite of resistance to its component agents.

To gain insight into potential mechanisms for
the loss of synergy, sequencing of 50 genes frequently
mutated in cancer was performed. Unique DNA variants
were detected in SMAD4 (Y412H) in HCT116AR, PTEN
(A126S) in LoVoAR, and TP53 (T18A) and TP53 (Y236C)
in HCT116CR cells. All these variants were predicted to
be “deleterious” and “probably damaging” by SIFT [20]
and Polyphen [21]. The PTEN (A126S) variant partially
inactivates PTEN [22], and thereby could activate PI3K
signaling and compensate for MEK pathway inhibition.
Inactivation of p53 by TP53 (18A) and TP53 (Y236C)
mutation could be involved in AQR, given the role
of p53 in tumor suppression and stress response [23].
Nonetheless, these aberrations were not consistent
between models, prompting further investigation.
Gene expression array analysis revealed EDN1 and
TGFB2 as the top candidate genes overexpressed in both
HCT116CR and LoVoCR cells but not in the other cells
(Supplementary Figure  S2). The EDN1 gene encodes
for endothelin-1, a vasoactive peptide, which is typically
associated with vasoconstriction and endothelial functions
[24]. Endothelin-1 binds to endothelin receptors A and B,
which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and via
second messengers activate many signaling pathways,
including MEK and PI3K pathways [24]. Endothelin-1 can
also trigger activation of protein kinase C [25], which can
lead directly to Erk and Akt activation [26, 27]. TGFβ is
a well-known cytokine that mediates numerous processes
such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, adhesion,
and migration through its activation of the SMAD family
of proteins [28]. Interestingly, inhibition of MEK and
PI3K signaling can lead to TGFβ activation [29], and
EDN1 is a known downstream target of TGFβ/SMAD
activated transcription [15, 16].
Taken together, a mechanism through which
HCT116CR and LoVoCR cells AQR to combination
treatment can be rationalized (Figure  4). It can be

hypothesized that the combined inhibition of PI3K
and MEK pathways led to the activation of TGFβ and
subsequently EDN1. The increased endothelin-1  then
provided compensatory activation of the PI3K and
MEK pathway, contributing to resistance to combination
treatment. In support of this hypothesis, supplementation
with endothelin-1 converted the synergism of
combination treatment in parental HCT116 and LoVo
cells to antagonism, along with activating Akt, Erk
and 4EBP1 (Figure  3, Supplementary Figure  S5).
Silencing of EDN1 or TGFB2 by siRNA also changed
the antagonism of combination treatment in HCT116CR
and LoVoCR cells to synergism, and reduced p-Akt and
p-Erk levels. Additionally, bosentan, a dual endothelin
receptor antagonist restored synergy between BKM120
and AZD6244 in HCT116CR and LoVoCR cells
(Supplementary Figure S6).
However, it is less clear how a change in drug
interaction has occurred. Historically, synergy or
antagonism could be understood as an enhancement or
reduction of receptor binding or enzyme activity resulting
from the combination of two agents [30]. Without a
common receptor or enzyme in this study, one approach
could be to consider the coordinated inhibition of the MEK
and PI3K pathways and its downstream effects as the
singular target of drug interaction. With this consideration,
the upstream activation of MEK and PI3K pathways by
endothelin-1  through GPCRs [31], or activation of Erk
and Akt downstream of MEK and PI3K inhibition [5], can
be viewed as means to decouple pathway inhibition and/
or bypass inhibitor effects, and thereby alter the singular
system. It also remains that endothelin-1 could activate
alternative pathways that modify the downstream events
of MEK and PI3K inhibition through its multiplicity
of pathways. The reduced apoptosis and inhibition of
migration of HCT116CR cells following combination
treatment (Figure 2) could be a manifestation of this effect.
The unexpected sensitivity of HCT116CR cells to Akt and
mTOR inhibitors could be indicative of altered pathway
dynamics, while also highlighting a potential rationale for
intervention.
In conclusion, the results of this study have
supported the hypothesis that an altered drug interaction
can determine AQR to combination treatment. Differences
in the phenotypes of AQR to single agent and combination
treatment have indicated that caution should be exercised
in assuming mechanisms of resistance for combination
treatment can be determined from studies of single agent
treatment. Overexpression of the TGFB2-EDN1 axis
was identified as a potential mechanism of acquired loss
of synergy for combination MEK and PI3K inhibitor
therapy, and it would be of interest to observe whether
this mechanism has a role in clinical resistance as current
trials of this combination mature. A precise delineation
of the mechanisms of altered drug interaction could not
be achieved, as the protocol of Chou and Talalay only
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

informs on the overall nature of interaction and not its
components [19]. Systems biology characterization of
the complex multiplicity of effectors and pathways in the
TGFB2-EDN1 axis may help to shed further light on how
drug interactions can affect drug resistance in its modern
setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of cells with acquired resistance
HCT116 and LoVo colorectal cancer cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in DMEM and
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), 50,000  units penicillin and 50  mg
streptomycin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cell lines
were continuously exposed to either a) two aliquots of
vehicle (DMSO), b) two aliquots of ½ IC50 concentration
of AZD6244, c) two aliquots of ½ IC50 concentration of
BKM120, or d) aliquots of IC50 concentration of AZD6244
and BKM120 each for a period of 3–8 months. The growth
of the cells was monitored weekly and acquisition of
resistance was indicated by normal proliferation of cells
under the described selection pressures. The cells were
maintained with the relevant concentrations of compounds
or DMSO respectively. Clonal selection was not carried
out for these various AQR cell lines. All the parental and
resistant cells passed the authentication testing using short
tandem repeat profiling performed by Promega GenePrint®
10 system (Madison, WI, USA). The cell lines were tested
at the commencement and also at the completion of the
study.

Drug sensitivity analysis
AZD6244, BKM120, BYL719, GDC0973,
sorafenib, trametinib, BEZ235, Ku-0063794, RAD001,
MK2206 and bosentan were obtained from Selleck
Chemicals (Houston, TX). Carboplatin and 5-FU were
obtained from Sigma. All stock solutions were prepared
in DMSO (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) at a final
concentration in culture media of 0.25% (v/v). Cells in
90  µl medium were seeded (3000 cells/well) onto 96well microtitre plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY). After
24  hours, 10  µl of medium containing compounds in
graded concentrations ranging from 0.1 µM to 1000 µM
was added to the wells. Control wells contained 20 μl of
relevant solvent to achieve a final concentration of 0.25%
of each solvent. The effect on cell numbers was assessed
using the CellTiter 96® AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell
Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) (MTS Assay)
at 72 h post-treatment. The IC50 was calculated as the drug
concentration that inhibited cell proliferation by 50%
compared to vehicle controls as previously described [32].

Drug combination analysis

Apoptosis measurement

The effect of combining compounds was evaluated
using the median-effect equation and combination index
(CI) method of Chou and Talalay [10]. For fixed-ratio
experiments the concentrations of each compound to
reduce the absorbance to 50% of that obtained with control
cells (inhibitory concentration 50%; IC50) were generated.
Most experiments were performed by combining both
agents added together at a fixed 1:1 ratio of the IC50 of
each individual drug or a fixed low growth inhibitory dose.
The effects of the combination were calculated for each
experimental condition using an spreadsheet based on
the median-effect analysis method of Chou and Talalay
[10]. We have previously described more details of this
analysis [33]. For each level of fraction unaffected (fu),
a CI was calculated as follows: CI  =  (D)1/(Df)1 + (D)2/
(Df)2 + [(D)1 (Df)2/(Df)1 (Df)2], where (D)1 and (D)2 are the
concentrations of the combination required to produce fu,
and (Df)1 and (Df)2 are the concentrations of the individual
drugs required to produce fu. Data giving linear regression
coefficients (r2) of median-effect plots  <  0.95  were
excluded. CI values of < 1, 1 and > 1 were considered to
indicate synergy, additivity and antagonism respectively.
CI values with the non-exclusive assumption have been
reported.

Apoptosis was measured using the Cell Death
ELISA® (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) kit. Cells were
plated in 96-well plates (3000 cells/well) and on the
following day treated with drug or solvent in a volume
adjusted to 200  μL with 10% FCS/DMEM. After
24 hours, nucleosomes were quantified according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

In vivo assessment
The study received ethics board approval at the
National Cancer Centre of Singapore and Singapore
General Hospital. All mice were maintained according to
the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals”
published by National Institute of Health, USA. They
were provided with sterilised food and water ad libitum,
and housed in negative pressure isolators with 12 h light/
dark cycles. HCT116 parental and HCT116CR cells
were implanted in both flanks of male SCID mice aged
9–10 weeks. Each injection consisted of approximately
5 × 106 cells. Treatments started when the tumors reached
the size of approximately 150–200  mm3. Mice bearing
tumors were treated as follows: AZD6244 (25  mg/kg)
+ BKM120 (40  mg/kg) p.o. daily, and vehicle controls
receiving PEG300/captisol (30:30:water) p.o. daily. Each
treatment arm involved 4 independent tumor-bearing
mice. The treatment lasted for 10 days. Bi-dimensional
measurements were performed twice a week and tumor
volumes are calculated based on the following formula:
Tumor volume = [(Length) × (Width2) × (p/6)]. Tumors in
the vehicle-treated groups were harvested on day 10 when
the tumor size reached ~ 1500 mm3. Tumors in AZD6244/
BKM120 group were allowed to grow for an additional
10 days before harvesting. The data were plotted as means
and standard errors for each treatment group versus time.
At the end of the study, the mice were sacrificed and tumor
samples collected.

ELISA analysis
Levels of p-AKT (Ser473), p-mTOR (Ser2448),
p-S6 (Ser235/236), p-4eBP1 (Thr37/46) and their
respective total proteins were measured using PathScan®
Sandwich ELISA kits (Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA) on the Infinite 200 Pro (Tecan,
Mannedorf, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Cell cycle analysis
Exponentially growing cells were seeded into
25  cm2 tissue culture flasks at 1  ×  106 cells/flask and
allowed to attach for 24  h prior to drug addition.
Following 24 h incubation, both attached and detached
cells were collected and fixed with 2 ml of ice-cold 70%
ethanol. Following centrifugation at 900 g for 5 mins,
the pellet was resuspended in 800 µl of PBS containing
100  µl of 1  mg/mL RNaseA and 100  µl of 400  µg/
mL propidium iodide (both from Sigma) and stored
overnight at 4°C. Samples were analysed on a LSRII
flow cytometer (BD, Franklin Lanes, NJ) equipped with
an argon laser tuned to 488 nm and the red fluorescence
collected at 630  nm. The data was analysed using
WinMDI v 2.8 and DNA histograms were gated on a
display of DNA peak signal against DNA area to exclude
debris and clumps.

Mutational analysis
DNA was extracted from cells using the DNA easy
Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and
quantified using the Picogeren method (Thermo Fisher,
Waltham, MA). Mutation analysis by next generation
sequencing was performed using the Ion AmpliSeq
Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (Thermo Fisher) on the Ion
Torrent PGM instrument (Thermo Fisher) according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. This panel consists of
207 amplicons covering approximately 22 kb of regions
in 50 genes with known cancer associations. A total
of 2  µl DNA were used to generate barcoded libraries
using the IonXpress barcode adapters (Thermo Fisher).
Amplified libraries were quantified using Tapestation

29195

Oncotarget

High Sensitivity D1000 screentape (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA) and up to 16 barcoded libraries were
combined to a final concentration of 10 pM. The pooled
libraries underwent amplification by emulsion PCR on Ion
Spheres Particles and enrichment using the Ion One Touch
System (Thermo Fisher). Sequencing was performed on
the Ion Torrent PGM with the 318 chip (Thermo Fisher).
Reads were aligned to hg19 and variant called using
Ion Torrent Suite 3.6.2 (Thermo Fisher). Variants were
annotated using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor v75 and
filtered for variants that were frequent in less than 5% of
the Asian population in the 1000 genomes project, and
non-synonymous.

Validation of knockdown efficiency was performed on
the ABI7900HT real time system (Thermo Fisher) using
Taqman gene expression assay for EDN1, TGFB2 and
ACTB. Relative quantities were measured by the ∆∆CT
method [34], using ACTB as a reference gene and parental
HCT116 cells as a calibrator.

Statistical analysis
Differences in IC50 values and protein ELISA were
assessed using a paired sample t-test. A one-sample t-test
(two-tailed) was used to compare the CIfu0.5  with the
predicted value for additivity of 1. For apoptosis, oneway ANOVA followed by Dunn’s Multiple Comparison
test was performed to assess for differences. All statistical
analyses were two-tailed and performed using GraphPad
Prism 5.00 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, CA). Statistical significance was considered when
p < 0.05.

Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini
kit (Qiagen) and confirmed for quality using the RNA
6000 Nano kit on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent
Technologies). Gene expression analysis was performed
using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0ST genechips on the
Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA). From 200 ng of total RNA, cDNA was generated,
fragmented, and biotin labelled using the Applause WTAmp ST system (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA). The prepared
targets were hybridized overnight to the arrays, after which
the arrays were washed, stained and scanned according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Affymetrix CEL files were
normalized by the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA)
method using the R/bioconductor Affy library. We used
the TM4-MeV software to perform both the unsupervised
hierarchical clustering and differential gene expression via
the LIMMA module.

Extracellular endothelin-1 priming
Exponentially growing HCT116 or LoVo parental
cells were seeded in 96 well plates (3000 cells/well). After
24  h, the culture medium was replaced by serum-free
medium for an additional 24 h in the presence or absence of
100 nM endothelin-1 (Sigma). After 24 h of priming, cells
were washed with sterile PBS and re-introduced to normal
serum containing medium and combination drug exposure
carried out as described in drug sensitivity analysis.
