Abstract

Author Manuscript

Drug resistance remains a vexing problem in the treatment of cancer patients. While many studies
have focused on cell autonomous mechanisms of drug resistance, we hypothesized that the tumor
microenvironment may confer innate resistance to therapy. Here we developed a co-culture system
to systematically assay the ability of 23 stromal cell types to influence the innate resistance of 45
cancer cell lines to 35 anti-cancer drugs. We found that stroma-mediated resistance is surprisingly
common – particularly to targeted agents. We further characterized the stroma-mediated resistance
of BRAF-mutant melanoma to RAF inhibition because most of these patients exhibit some degree
of innate resistance1-4. Proteomic analysis showed that stromal secretion of the growth factor
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) resulted in activation of the HGF receptor MET, reactivation of
the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, and immediate resistance to RAF inhibition.
Immunohistochemistry confirmed stromal HGF expression in patients with BRAF-mutant
melanoma and a statistically significant correlation between stromal HGF expression and innate
resistance to treatment. Dual inhibition of RAF and MET resulted in reversal of drug resistance,
suggesting RAF/MET combination therapy as a potential therapeutic strategy for BRAF-mutant
melanoma. A similar resistance mechanism was uncovered in a subset of BRAF-mutant colorectal
and glioblastoma cell lines. More generally, these studies indicate that the systematic dissection of
tumor-microenvironment interactions may reveal important mechanisms underlying drug
resistance.

Oncoprotein-targeted drugs hold enormous promise for the future of cancer treatment.
However, complete clinical responses are rare, suggesting that mechanisms exist to render a
substantial portion of tumor cells resistant to treatment. For example, melanomas harboring
the BRAF V600E mutation show a dramatic response to RAF inhibitors, but responses are
almost always partial, and tumors often recur within 6 months1-4.

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that innate drug resistance might be caused at least in part by factors
secreted by the tumor microenvironment. While growth and metastasis-promoting effects of
the microenvironment have been well documented5,6, a role in drug resistance has only been
partially explored7-11. To test the hypothesis that stromal cells might confer innate resistance
to cancer cells, we developed a co-culture system whereby GFP-labeled tumor cells are cocultured with stromal cells, and the ability of the stromal cells to modulate drug sensitivity is
measured by monitoring GFP levels over time (Supplementary Fig. 1). Forty-five GFPlabeled human cancer cell lines were cultured either alone or in combination with a panel of
up to 23 human stromal cell lines in the presence of increasing doses of 35 widely used anticancer drugs (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
Our analysis of cancer cell-stromal cell-drug interactions (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4)
yielded a striking result – anti-cancer drugs capable of killing tumor cells when cultured

alone, frequently are rendered ineffective when tumor cells are cultured in the presence of
stroma (Figure 1a). For example, certain dermal fibroblasts were able to confer complete
resistance of colorectal and pancreatic cancer cell lines to the cytotoxic agent gemcitabine
(Figure 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2). Different stromal cells conferred resistance to BRAFmutant melanoma cell lines treated with RAF inhibitors, and ERBB2 over-expressing breast
cancer cell lines treated with ERBB2 inhibitors (Figure 1c, 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3 and
4). The stroma-mediated resistance phenomenon was particularly pronounced with targeted
agents compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy (P < 0.001; Supplementary
Table 2). Overall, of the 23 targeted agents in the panel, 15 (65%) showed evidence of
microenvironment-mediated resistance (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary
methods).

We next explored the mechanism of stroma-mediated innate resistance to the RAF inhibitor
PLX4720 (an analog of which, vemurafenib, was recently FDA-approved for the treatment
of BRAF-mutant melanoma). In a recent phase 3 clinical trial, 48% of BRAF mutant
melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib had a confirmed response, and only 0.9% of
patients had a complete response, indicating a high rate of innate resistance2. We tested 18
stromal cell lines for their ability to confer resistance of 7 BRAF V600E melanoma cell lines
to PLX4720. Of these, 6 fibroblast lines conferred resistance (Figure 1c and Supplementary
Fig. 3).

Author Manuscript

To determine if the rescue effect was mediated by direct fibroblast-tumor contact or by the
secretion of soluble factors, we tested the ability of fibroblast-conditioned growth media to
recapitulate the resistance effect. Fibroblast-conditioned media rescued BRAF-mutant
melanoma cells from PLX4720, indicating that the rescue was due to a factor secreted by the
fibroblasts (Figure 2a). To identify the rescuing secreted factor, we performed an antibody
array-based analysis of 567 secreted factors (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6), comparing the
conditioned media from the 6 rescuing to 12 non-rescuing stromal cells. The factor best
correlated with PLX4720 resistance was hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a wellcharacterized growth factor whose secretion by mesenchymal cells induces activation of the
MET receptor tyrosine kinase (Figure 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5 and 6). While MET has
been reported to be overexpressed12,13 and contribute to the progression of melanoma12, it
has not been previously implicated in RAF-inhibitor resistance. A potential role of MET
activation in the development of resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib in non-small cell
lung cancer, however, has been recently reported10,14.

Author Manuscript

We next tested HGF expression by immunohistochemistry in 34 BRAF V600E melanoma
patient-derived biopsies taken just prior to treatment with BRAF inhibitor (or a combination
of BRAF and MEK inhibitors). HGF was detected in the tumor-associated stromal cells in
23/34 patients (68%) (Fig. 3a, 3b and Supplementary Table 7), and phospho-MET
immunofluorescence studies similarly documented MET phosphorylation (activation) in
patient samples (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Our in vitro studies predict that the presence of stromal HGF should be associated with
innate resistance. Indeed, patients with stromal HGF had a significantly poorer response to
treatment compared to those lacking expression (P < 0.05; Fig 3c). Interestingly, only one of

the 34 patients had a durable complete response (14 months and continuing), and this patient
lacked HGF expression (Supplementary Table 7). On-treatment biopsies taken 2 weeks after
treatment initiation were also available from 10 patients, and for 5 of those (50%), stromal
HGF expression was found to be increased compared to pre-treatment (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Table 7). Whether this increase is attributable to recruitment of HGFsecreting fibroblasts to the tumor or up-regulation of HGF in existing fibroblasts remains to
be determined. Of note, both normal skin and benign nevi exhibited stromal HGF expression
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Our results thus support the clinical relevance of HGF-mediated
resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Importantly, Settleman and colleagues similarly observed an
association between plasma HGF levels and response to BRAF inhibitor treatment (Wilson
et al, manuscript submitted15).

Author Manuscript

To establish HGF as the cause of drug resistance, and not simply a biomarker of it, we tested
the ability of recombinant HGF to induce resistance, as well as the ability of HGFneutralizing antibody or the MET-inhibitory small-molecule crizotinib to block fibroblastinduced PLX4720 resistance. These experiments indicated that HGF is both necessary and
sufficient for conferring the resistance phenotype (Figure 2c, 2d and Supplementary Fig.
9,10 and 11). Consistent with this observation, the extent to which different BRAF-mutant
melanoma cell lines (n=20) could be rescued by HGF was highly correlated with their level
of MET expression (Supplementary Fig. 12).

Author Manuscript

While our stromal cell profiling studies pointed to the HGF/MET axis as the most relevant
in mediating PLX4720 resistance, it is conceivable that other ligands of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK) might similarly confer resistance. To test this possibility, we collected 22
well-characterized RTK ligands and tested their ability to rescue BRAF-mutant melanoma
cells from either PLX4720 or the MEK inhibitor PD184352. Surprisingly, despite many
RTKs being expressed and activated by their cognate ligands, HGF was the only ligand that
conferred substantial resistance to RAF or MEK inhibition (Figure 2e, Supplementary Fig.
13, 14 and 15 and Supplementary Table 8).

Author Manuscript

We next sought to clarify the precise mechanism by which HGF/MET is uniquely capable of
inducing primary resistance to PLX4720. MET is known to activate both the MAP kinase
(MEK/ERK) and the PI-3-kinase (PI3K/AKT) pathways (Supplementary Fig. 16), and both
pathways have been suspected to be involved in acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors16-18.
We used Western blotting to assess ERK and AKT activation status in a panel of 7 BRAFmutant melanoma cell lines treated with BRAF inhibitor together with various RTK ligands.
HGF treatment led to sustained activation of both ERK and AKT, whereas such dual
activation was not seen with any of the other RTK ligands in any of the melanoma lines
(Figure 4a and Supplementary Fig. 17). We note that while EGF, FGF-1 and PDGF-BB
reactivated ERK in most cell lines, phospho-ERK levels were modest compared to cells
treated with HGF. Moreover, these ligands failed to activate AKT. Similarly, insulin or
IGF-1 treatment led to a transient increase in phospho-AKT, but did not activate ERK
(Figure 4b and Supplementary Fig. 18). HGF was thus unique in its ability to induce
sustained activation of both ERK and AKT (Figure 4c and Supplementary Fig. 19 and 20).
Importantly, we found that HGF-mediated activation of ERK was most profound under
BRAF inhibition compared to MEK inhibition (Figure 4c and Supplementary Fig. 19). This

may be best explained by the fact that in the presence of BRAF inhibitors, MET can
reactivate MEK through RAF1 (CRAF), thus bypassing BRAF, which is not possible under
conditions of direct MEK inhibition (Figure 4c, Supplementary Fig. 16).
Our model thus predicts that both the MAPK pathway and the PI3K/AKT pathway
contribute to the primary resistance induced by HGF-secreting stromal cells. In agreement
with this model, we have found that i) HGF-induced resistance is greater under BRAF
inhibition compared to MEK inhibition (Figure 2d), ii) combination BRAF- and MEKinhibitor treatment is not sufficient to eliminate HGF-induced resistance, as this combination
does not silence AKT (Supplementary Fig. 21), and iii) combination treatment with MEK
and AKT inhibitors suppresses the majority of HGF-induced drug resistance
(Supplementary Fig. 21).

Author Manuscript

Our discovery of HGF-mediated innate resistance to BRAF inhibitors should be
distinguished from recent reports proposing dysregulation of IGF, PDGF, COT, BRAF or
MEK as BRAF-inhibitor resistance mechanisms18-22. In these reports, the emergence of late,
acquired drug resistance was studied (e.g. following exposure to drug for many months),
whereas we find that HGF-secreting stromal cells confer immediate, innate resistance to
BRAF inhibitors. For example, the p61BRAF(V600E) splice variant that was recently
shown to confer resistance to RAF inhibitors21 was never seen in tumors prior to RAF
inhibitor treatment, implicating this splice variant as a mechanism for acquired rather than
innate resistance. Whether HGF has a role in acquired resistance as well remains to be
determined.

Activation of the EGF receptor was recently shown to drive the resistance of some BRAF
V600E colorectal cancer cell lines to RAF inhibition23,24. In order to explore a possible role
for MET activation in BRAF-mutant non-melanoma cancers, we tested 7 non-melanoma
BRAF-mutant cell lines (5 colorectal and 2 glioblastoma), and found that all 7 had evidence
of phospho-MET expression (Supplementary Fig. 22). Although stromal HGF expression is
less common in colorectal cancer compared to melanoma (Supplementary Fig. 8a), MET
overexpression and HGF autocrine secretion have been documented in colorectal
cancer25-27. We indeed identified two HGF-secreting, BRAF-mutant non-melanoma cell
lines (one colorectal (RKO) and one glioblastoma (KG-1-C); Supplementary Fig. 6), and in
these cell lines, combined RAF and MET (but not EGFR) inhibition resulted in a clear
synergistic effect (Supplementary Fig. 22 and 23). Synergy between BRAF and MET
inhibitors was more variable among non-HGF-secreting BRAF-mutant cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. 22). As predicted by our proposed mechanism of resistance, monotherapy with BRAF or MEK inhibitors had no effect on pAKT and caused little inhibition of
pERK in HGF-secreting cell lines. However, dual inhibition of BRAF and MET resulted in
significant inhibition of both pERK and pAKT (Supplementary Fig. 24). The extent to
which autocrine or microenvironment-mediated MET activation in non-melanoma BRAFmutant tumors explains their failure to respond to BRAF inhibition deserves further
investigation.
The findings reported here have potentially immediate clinical implications. Several smallmolecule or antibody inhibitors of HGF/MET are in clinical development or have been

FDA-approved for other indications. Given the tolerability of those agents and the similar
tolerability of BRAF inhibitors, combination clinical trials in BRAF-mutant melanoma,
colorectal cancer, and possibly other tumor types should be considered.
Lastly, we note that the stroma-derived, HGF-mediated RAF inhibitor resistance mechanism
detailed here was but one of many such stroma-mediated drug resistance interactions
uncovered in our initial screen (Figure 1a). Our findings point to the microenvironment as an
important, yet under-studied source of cancer drug resistance. Moreover, the results suggest
that such resistance mechanisms can be uncovered through the systematic dissection of
tumor-microenvironment interactions. Future studies should therefore aim to identify such
resistance mechanisms for all drugs currently in development, potentially leading to
mechanism-based combination regimens such as the BRAF-MET combination proposed
here.

3. Clinical samples

Author Manuscript

Patients with metastatic melanoma containing BRAF V600E mutation (confirmed by
genotyping) were enrolled on clinical trials for treatment with a BRAF inhibitor or
combined BRAF + MEK inhibitors (Supplementary Table 7) and were consented for tissue
acquisition per IRB-approved protocol. Tumor biopsies were performed pre-treatment (day
0), at 10-14 days on treatment, and at time of progression. Formalin-fixed tissue was
analyzed to confirm that viable tumor was present via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining. Tumor responses were determined by the investigators according to the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
4. Analysis of Co-culture screen data
The GFP readings from each well on day 7 were background subtracted by the readings in
the same wells on day 1, and quadruplicates were averaged. The drug effect for each cancer
cell line in the presence or absence of stromal cells was calculated by normalizing the
number of cells (GFP) after 7 days of treatment to the number of cells (GFP) in DMSO
control wells. The drug effect in the presence of stromal cells was further normalized to the
effect that each stromal cell type has on cancer cell proliferation when no drug is present
(See “Without Stroma” and “With Stroma” columns in Supplementary table 3). “Rescue
score” was calculated by subtracting the “Without stroma” drug effect from the “With
stroma” drug effect.

5. Analysis of Co-culture screen data
The GFP readings from each well on day 1 were subtracted from the readings in the same
wells on day 7. Quadruplicates were averaged. The effect of each drug on the proliferation
of each cancer cell line was calculated by normalizing the GFP reading of the cancer cell
line when treated with a drug to the GFP reading of the same cancer cell line when treated
with DMSO control (“No stroma” column in Supplementary table 3). The proliferation of

the cancer cell under a drug when co-cultured with a stroma cell line was normalized first to
the proliferation of the same cancer cell line when grown without drug or stromal cell line
and then normalized again to the effect that the specific stromal cell line has on the
proliferation of the cancer cell line (“With Stroma” column in Supplementary table 3).
“Rescue score” was calculated by subtracting the “No stroma” drug effect from the “With
stroma” drug effect.
6. Assigning “rescue by stroma” score to all screened drugs (Supplementary table 2)

Author Manuscript

Only cases in which a drug slowed the proliferation of a cancer cell line to <30% were
analyzed (Supplementary table 4). Rescue was counted as positive if the rescue score was >
0.3. Drugs that were rescued by stromal cells in at least 3 different cancer cell lines
representing >40% of all screened cancer cell lines for this drug got the maximal score: “+
+”. Drugs that were rescued by stromal cells in 3 cancer cell lines that represent only
20-40% of screened cancer cell lines or that were rescued in only 1 or 2 cell lines that
represent more than 40% of screened cancer cell lines were scored: “+”.
7. Antibody arrays

Author Manuscript

Soluble proteins in the media of the stromal cell-lines were measured using RayBio Human
cytokine array G4000 (#AAH-CYT-G4000-8) and RayBio Biotin Label-based Human
Antibody Array (#AAH-BLG-1-4), according to recommended protocols. These arrays can
detect 274 and 507 proteins, respectively. Stromal cells were plated 3 days before the
experiment in DMEM containing 10% FBS and were 75-90% confluent when media was
collected and filtered. Media with 10% FBS was also hybridized to the arrays and used later
for normalization. 10 Technical and Biological replicates were done – both showing a very
high correlation (Correlation coefficient > 0.9) (Data not shown). Hybridization was done
overnight in 4°C. All slides were scanned using Axon’s GenePix 4000B scanner and
analyzed using GenePix Pro 6.0. The F532 Median - B532 score was used and averaged
across triplicates on each array. Results were then normalized using internal controls and
values of cytokines in clear media + 10% FBS were subtracted. All results are available in
Supplementary tables 5 and 6.
8. Stromal averaged Melanoma rescue scores
The averaged melanoma rescue effect of each stromal cell line was calculated by averaging
the rescue scores of this cell line (Supp. Table 3) across all melanoma cell lines and all
PLX4720 concentrations. Only instances in which the treatment caused a drop of
proliferation below 0.3 when no stromal cells are present were included in this calculation.

9. The effect of pre-conditioned media (PCM)
PCM was prepared by filtering media from 80-90% confluent 15cm plates that were plated 3
days earlier and then diluting it 1:1 with fresh media. Experiments were performed
according to the previously described co-culture experiment protocol except for the
following changes: 1. On day 0, 384-well plates were seeded with 20ul/well of PCM instead
of 20ul of stromal cells. 2. On day 1, the media from all wells was changed to fresh PCM. 3.

On day 4, media was changed to fresh PCM instead of fresh media before re-treating the
cells.
10. Hierarchical clustering
Unsupervised Hierarchical clustering of stromal cell lines according to their ability to rescue
melanoma cancer cell lines from 2uM of PLX4720 (Supp. Table 3) was done using GENE-E
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/). Euclidean distance metric was
used.
11. HGF ELISA

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated 3 days before the experiment in DMEM containing 10% FBS and were
75-90% confluent when media was collected and filtered. HGF ELISA was performed using
RayBio Human HGF ELISA kit (#ELH-HGF-001) according to the kit’s instructions. The
media was diluted 1:1 with diluents B before it was added to the assay microplate. For the
standard HGF curve we used the same HGF that was used for all other experiments
(#228-10702-2) and not the HGF that comes with the kit. Absorbance at 450nm was read
using Spectramax M5e (Molecular Devices).
12. Neutralizing HGF by Anti-HGF antibodies
Co-culture experiments were performed as described above except for the addition of
Neutralizing anti-HGF antibodies (R&D Systems #MAB294) on days 0 and on day 4 after
the media was changed.
13. Western blot analysis and quantification

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cells were plated a day before treatment in a 6-well plate at 5×105 cells/well, and were
treated the next day. At the designated time points, cells were lysed with lysis buffer
containing 50mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1mg/mL NaF, a
one pellet per 10ml each of Roche PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor (04906837001) and
Roche Complete Mini protease inhibitor (Roche). Protein concentrations were determined
by BioRad DC Protein Assay Kit II. Samples were mixed with 4x protein sample loading
buffer (Li-Cor #928-40004) and NuPage sample reducing agent (Invitrogen #NP0009), and
run on a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (NuPage #WG1402BOX) at 120V. Membranes were
transferred using Program 4 on the iBlot Gel Transfer Device (Invitrogen #IB1001).
Western blotting was performed with standard methods, with immunoblotting performed
according to antibody manufacturer specifications. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence was
detected with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor), and signal intensity was
quantified with Odyssey Application Software (Licor). All quantifications were first
normalized to background intensity, and then to GAPDH loading control.
14. High throughput westerns
High throughput western blot experiments (Fig 4a and Supp. Figure 17) were performed as
described above, except for the following changes: 1) Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at
5×104 cells/well, 2) Samples were mixed with E-Page 4x loading buffer (Invitrogen

#EPBUF-01) and run on 6% E-PAGE 96-well gels (Invitrogen #EP09606). For the transfer
Program 3 of the iBlot Gel Transfer Device was used.
15. Rescue of melanoma cell lines by cytokines
One day prior to treatment, cancer cells were seeded in black, 384-well plates (Corning
#3712) at a concentration of 2500 cells/well. On day 1, all 22 ligands were added at 5
different concentrations to 6 melanoma cell lines treated with PLX4720, PD184352, or
DMSO control. On day 4, media was changed to fresh and cells were retreated with drugs
and cytokines. GFP was read of the plates on Days 1, 4, and 7 by SpectraMax M5e
microplate reader (Molecular Devices).
16. Tyrosine kinase phosphorylation profiling

Author Manuscript

Luminex immunosandwich assays were performed as previously described32 with the
following modifications: Antibodies were conjugated to Luminex MagPlex microspheres
(Luminex). Assays were carried out in 384-well ThermoMatrix square bottom plates
(Thermo) in conjunction with a 96-well (CyBio) and a 384-well (BioMek) liquid handler.
The data was acquired with a FlexMap 3D instrument (Luminex) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The raw data was normalized by subtracting sample and
antibody backgrounds.
17. Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Deparaffinized tissue sections were treated with Antigen Retrieval Citra Solution (Biogenex
Laboratories, #HK086-9K) in microwave for 15 min. Tissue sections were then incubated
with Peroxidase Blocking Reagent (15 min; DAKO #S2001) and Protein Block (15 min;
DAKO #X0909). Primary antibody against HGF (R&D #AB-294-NA; 0.75 μg/mL), MET
(Invitrogen #187366; 4 μg/mL), pERK (Cell Signaling #4376; 1:200 dilution) or pAKT
(Cell Signaling #4060; 1:50 dilution) was applied, and slides were incubated for 16 h at 4
degrees. For HGF, sections were then incubated with rabbit anti-goat antibody (Vector
#BA-5000) for 30 min. Signals were visualized using EnVision™+/HRP, Rabbit (for HGF;
DAKO, #K4003) or Mouse (for MET; DAKO, #K4001) or SignalStain® Boost IHC
Detection Reagent (for pERK and pAKT; Cell Signaling #8114), diaminobenzidine (DAKO
#K3468) and hematoxylin counterstain. To detect MET expression in melanoma, VECTOR
VIP Peroxidase Substrate Kit (Vector #SK-4600) was used instead of diaminobenzidine. All
Immunostained slides were scored by a pathologist (T.M.) blinded to the clinical outcome
data.
18. Immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

Fresh frozen tissue sections were stained using Cell Signaling Technology’s general
protocol. Sections were blocked using PBS with 5% normal goat serum (Cell Signaling #
5425S) and 0.3% Triton-X for 1 hour. Primary antibody against p-Met (Y1234/1235) (Cell
signaling #3077S;1:100 dilution) diluted in PBS with 1% BSA, and 0.3% Triton-X was
applied, and slides were incubated for 16 h at 4 degrees. Sections were then washed with
PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Dylight 488 (ThermoFisher
Scientific, #35552; 1:500 dilution) for 1 hour. Slides were mounted with Prolong anti-fade

reagent with DAPI (Life Technologies, CA, #P36935). Experiments were done in parallel
with SignalSlide Phospho-Met (Tyr1234/1235) IHC control slide (Cell Signaling, #8118) for
proper staining. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope.
19. Calculating excess over Bliss
The Bliss independence model predicts the combined response C for two single compounds
with response A and B according to the relationship C = A + B - A * B, where A is the
fractional inhibition of compound A at the particular concentration and B is the fractional
inhibition of compound B at the particular concentration. According to this model, the
excess above the predicted Bliss independence represents the synergistic effect of the
combination treatment33.

Figure 1. Effect of stromal cells on chemoresistance of cancer cell lines

Author Manuscript

a, 45 GFP labeled cancer cell lines were treated with 35 drugs either alone or in co-culture
with a panel of up to 23 stromal cell lines and primary cells. The drug effect was calculated
by normalizing the number of cells (GFP) after 7 days of treatment to the number of cells
(GFP) in DMSO control wells. X-axis represents drug effect in the absence of stromal cells
while Y-axis represents drug effect in the presence of stromal cells. The Y axis was also
normalized to the effect that each stromal cell type has on cancer cell proliferation when no
drug is present (in order to distinguish true rescue from stromal effects on proliferation). The
middle diagonal line represents the expected result when stromal cells do not confer
resistance. Upper and lower diagonal lines represent one standard deviation from the middiagonal line. b, Hierarchical clustering of stromal cells according to their ability to rescue
colorectal (CRC) and pancreatic cancer cell lines from 0.1uM gemcitabine. c, Hierarchical
clustering of stromal cells according to their ability to rescue melanoma cancer cell lines
with V600E BRAF mutation from 2uM PLX4720. d, Hierarchical clustering of stromal cells
according to their ability to rescue HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines from 2uM
lapatinib. See Supplementary Figures 1 to 3 for details.

a, 3 melanoma cell lines were co-cultured with conditioned media from three fibroblast cell
lines or with fresh media and treated with 2uM PLX4720. Proliferation was quantified after
7 days and compared to non-treated cells. Bars represent standard error between replicates
(n = 3). b, the HGF secretion level of 18 stromal cell lines measured by a protein cytokine
array (Supplementary Table 5) is plotted vs. the ability of each stromal cell line to rescue
BRAF V600E melanoma cell lines from PLX4720 (Supplementary Fig. 3). c, Effect of HGF
(6.25-50ng/ml) on proliferation of melanoma cell lines under PLX4720 or PD184352
treatment. Bars represent standard error between replicates (n = 3). d, Drug resistance
manifests only in the presence of HGF-secreting stromal cells, and is reversed by MET
inhibitor. Melanoma cell lines were co-cultured with nine stromal cell lines, representing
HGF secreting and non-secreting stromal cells and treated with PLX4720 (2uM) or
PD184352 (1um) with or without 0.2uM crizotinib. Proliferation was quantified after 7 days
and normalized to non-treated cells. Results were averaged across 4 stromal cell lines that
secrete HGF and 5 that do not. Non-averaged results are presented in Supplementary Fig.
11. Bars represent standard error between replicates (n = 3). e, 22 cytokines were added to 6
melanoma cell lines that were then treated with 2uM PLX4720 or 1uM PD184352 or DMSO
control. Proliferation quantified after 7 days and normalized to No-Cytokine. Results shown
are averaged for all cell lines and both drugs. Bars represent standard error between
replicates (n = 3).
