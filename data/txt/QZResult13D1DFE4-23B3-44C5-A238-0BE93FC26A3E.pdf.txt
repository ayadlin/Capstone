ABSTRACT
In children with hepatocellular carcinoma (pHCC) the 5-year overall survival rate
is poor. Effects of cytostatic therapies such as cisplatin and doxorubicin are limited
due to chemoresistance and tumor relapse. In adult HCC, several antitumor properties
are described for the use of curcumin. Curcumin is one of the best-investigated
phytochemicals in complementary oncology without relevant side effects. Its use
is limited by low bioavailability. Little is known about the influence of curcumin on
pediatric epithelial hepatic malignancies. We investigated the effects of curcumin
in combination with cisplatin on two pediatric epithelial liver tumor cell lines. As
mechanisms of action inhibition of NFkappaB, beta-catenin, and decrease of cyclin
D were identified. Using a mouse xenograft model we could show a significant
decrease of alpha-fetoprotein after combination therapy of oral micellar curcumin
and cisplatin. Significant concentrations of curcuminoids were found in blood samples,
organ lysates, and tumor tissue after oral micellar curcumin administration. Micellar
curcumin in combination with cisplatin can be a promising strategy for treatment of
pediatric HCC.

Recent attempts to improve the therapeutic
options for patients with high risk or relapsing
tumors include investigations of natural or synthetic
chemopreventive agents. Curcumin, the predominant
curcuminoid extracted from the rhizome of
Curcuma longa Linn., is a phytochemical used in
complementary oncology. With its pleiotropic effects
on cellular signaling pathways, it decreases cancer cell
proliferation and induces apoptosis [6]. In adult HCC,
chemopreventive activities have been described, e.g. the
amelioration of doxorubicin-associated cardiomyopathy
and hypoxia-mediated sorafenib resistance [7, 8].
Moreover, curcumin inhibits diethylnitrosamine
induced hepatocellular carcinoma in rats, and leads to
apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro [9, 10].
Curcumin is known for its poor oral bioavailability.
Incorporation of curcumin into micelles leads to an up
to 185-fold enhanced bioavailability in healthy humans

INTRODUCTION
Malignant liver tumors in childhood are rare, the
annual incidence rate for the United States was stated
with 1.8 cases per million children younger than 15 years
[1]. While hepatoblastomas (HB) account for the majority
(91%) of these tumors, pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma
(pHCC) accounts for approximately 1%. The outcome
in hepatoblastoma has improved during the last decades,
but still the patients with PRETEXT 4 stages suffer from
poor 5-year-survival rates of 20–30% [2, 3]. The most
cases of pediatric HCC present in advanced stages with
poor outcome and 5-year overall survival rates of only
10–23% [1, 4]. Standard therapy consists in neoadjuvant
PLADO therapy (Cisplatin – CDDP, and doxorubicin –
DOXO), and resection of the tumors, respectively liver
transplantation [5].

without causing adverse effects [11]. In children with
inflammatory bowel disease it revealed an excellent
tolerability of high doses (4g per day), and induced no
side effects [12]. Despite its reported safety, there are
currently no published studies describing the effects of
curcumin on malignant epithelial pediatric liver tumors.
We therefore aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential
of native and highly bioavailable micellar curcumin [11]
alone and in combination with cisplatin in pHCC. The
established pediatric epithelial liver tumor cell lines HCAFW1 and HepG2 [13, 14] were used in combination with
an orthotopic pHCC mouse model.

15.04–22.54). In HepG2, the IC50 for native curcumin
was 29.07 μmol/L (CI95% 23.77–32.45) and for micellar
curcumin 19.52 μmol/L (CI95% 15.31–21.98). The IC50
values for native curcumin were numerically higher
than for micellar curcumin, but did not reach statistical
significance (Figure 1). Native curcumin was therefore
used for further in vitro experiments.
Even in high-density cell cultures, curcumin
significantly decreased the cell viability. The IC50 for
native curcumin determined in low-density cell culture
experiments were 46.01 μmol/L (CI95% 38.52–54.97)
in HC-AFW1 and 45.17 μmol/L (CI95% 41.78–48.81) in
HepG2 cells. The native curcumin IC50 in high-density
culture were 52.04 μmol/L (CI95% 49.54–54.64) for
HC-AFW1 and 97.35 μmol/L (CI95% 80.79–117.29)
for HepG2 cells (Figure 2). In combination with
CDDP, curcumin operates additively on cell viability
(Figure 3). The IC50 of CDDP decreased significantly
under increasing curcumin concentrations: without
curcumin the IC50 of  CDDP was 6.68 μg/ml; after
addition of 2.7 μmol/L the IC50 was 5.07 μg/L, after
addition of 13.6 μmol/L the IC50 was 4.52 μg/L, and after
addition of 27.2 μmol/L the IC50 was 1.19 µg/L.
In further studies we recently showed an inhibitory
influence of beta-catenin inhibitors on hepatoblastoma
cells, modulating the nuclear localization of beta-catenin

RESULTS
Curcumin reduces viability of hepatocellular
carcinoma cells
We initially compared the effects of native and
micellar curcumin as well as unloaded micelles on the cell
lines. There was no effect on fibroblasts, or of unloaded
micelles on the cells (data not shown). Furthermore,
native and micellar curcumin decreased the cell viability
of both cell lines. In HC-AFW1, the following IC50 were
determined: native curcumin, 34.86 μmol/L (CI95%
31.65–39.01); micellar curcumin, 19.38 μmol/L (CI95%

HepG2 cells in low A. and high B. density cell cultures after 48 h curcumin (CUR) administration. IC50 were lower in low density cultures
(HC-AFW1: 16.95 (46.01 μM), CI95% 14.19–20.25; HepG2: 16.64 (45.17 μM), CI95% 15.39–17.98) compared to high density cultures
(HC-AFW1: 19.17 (52.04 μM), CI95% 18.25–20.13; HepG2: 35.86 (97.35 μM), CI95% 29.76–43.21), however this was not significant.

[15]. In HC-AFW1 cells, beta-catenin is located mainly in
the nucleus and plays an important role in cell proliferation
[16]. Upon incubation of cells with low concentrations
of native or micellar curcumin (1.8 μg/mL) for 24 h, a
shift from nuclear beta-catenin towards cytoplasmatic
and membranous beta-catenin was observed by confocal
microscopy (Figure 4).
With real time PCR further analyses were carried
out. Not only the expression of beta-catenin but also
the expression of NFkappaB and cyclin D decreased
significantly after 8 hours of incubation with curcumin. In
HC-AFW1 cells, curcumin dosage was doubled compared
to HepG2 cells (Figure 4).

Overall, tumor volumes showed high variances.
In the group of combination-treatment with curcumin +
CDDP tumor volumes were lower than in the other groups;
however, this did not reach statistical significance due to
high variances (p = 0.075, Figure 5E).
Oral administration of daily micellar curcumin did
not cause any side effects, such as weight loss, diarrhea,
or apathy, in the mice. In all analyzed blood samples from
mice treated with curcumin alone or in combination with
CDDP, significant concentrations of curcumin, DMC, and
BDMC were found. Curcumin concentrations significantly
differed between organs (p = 0.000) and the highest
concentrations were observed in the lung and the lowest
in the brain. The concentrations in the tumor tissue were
higher than in the liver. The curcuminoid concentrations
were highest 2 hours after administration and declined
thereafter, showing that micellar curcumin is rapidly
absorbed and reaches its maximum concentrations in less
than 2 hours (Figure 6).

Micellar curcumin modulates tumor growth
and decreases AFP levels
The tumor-uptake after intrasplenic tumor cell injection
of HC-AFW1 cells into NSG mice was 91.5% (43/47) and
the mice developed multiple intrahepatic tumor nodules
(Figure 5A) with typical histology (Figure 5B). In contrast
to the in vitro results, there was no difference between the
beta-catenin distributional pattern between the groups in
immunhistology (Figure 5C). AFP concentrations differed
significantly between groups at week 3 (p = 0.006) and 4
( p = 0.023), but not week 2 ( p = 0.35). The combination
therapy (micellar curcumin + CDDP) significantly reduced
AFP concentrations compared to control group (week 3: 1.04
± 0.67 vs. 2.73 ± 0.64, p = 0.004; week 4: 2.05 ± 1.01 vs.
3.35 ± 0.43, respectively, p = 0.02). Compared to controls,
AFP concentrations were numerically lower in mice treated
with curcumin or CDDP individually, but this did not reach
statistical significance (Figure 5D).

DISCUSSION
HCC in children is extremely rare with an overall
age-adjusted rate of 0.41 per 1,000,000 in children
younger than 20 years [17]. The overall long-term survival
in pHCC, however, is poor due to advanced disease at
diagnosis and resistance to common drugs [1, 4]. In
contrast to HCC in adults, the majority of pHCC cases
are not related to hepatic cirrhosis [5]. Moreover, there
are some biological differences on the molecular level
between adult and pediatric HCC [18]. Thus, the transfer
of results from basic research and treatment concepts from
adult HCC to pHCC is limited.

were cultured with increasing concentrations of CDDP and curcumin for 48 hours. Isobolograms show additive effects of combination
therapy.

In the present study, we assessed the therapeutic
potential of curcumin on pHCC in vitro and in vivo on the
basis of our newly described pHCC cell line HC-AFW1
[13]. We successfully established an orthotopic pHCC
model in NSG mice with an excellent tumor uptake of
91.5%. Most authors describe models, in which either
subcutaneously grown HCC tissue from one mouse
is transplanted into the liver of another mouse [19] or
HCC cells are injected directly into the liver [20]. Both
methods bear the risk of uncontrollable bleeding; and
in the tissue transplant model, the number of required
laboratory animals is large because of the need for a donor
and a recipient animal. The infrequent occurrence of liver
metastases from a primary subcutaneously implanted
tumor comes along with infrequent and unpredictable
orthotopic growth [21]. Only few reports present data of
tumor uptake-rates [22, 23]. We achieved an intrahepatic
multinodular tumor growth through intrasplenic tumor
cell injection. To avoid large tumors in the spleen, a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

splenectomy was carried out during the same anesthesia.
Tumor growth was monitored by AFP detection in the
serum as a surrogate marker of relative tumor burden and
response to therapy, which is in line with our previous
report of a high AFP expression in HC-AFW1-cells [13].
This orthotopic pHCC model served as the bases
for further analyses of the effects of curcumin on HCC.
Several studies provided evidence for a therapeutic
potential of curcumin in the treatment of adult HCC [24]. A
main barrier for the use of curcumin in clinical trials is its
poor bioavailability and chemical instability [25]. Hence,
several attempts to optimize the (oral) bioavailability
of curcumin have been described. Only very few of
the studies employing curcumin for cancer treatment
in animals provided data on curcumin concentrations
in serum, organs, or tumors [26–28]. In clinical trials,
most of the tested galenics of curcumin achieve only
low serum curcumin concentrations, if any [29–38],
despite of using extremely high doses [29, 30, 39].

All these studies demonstrated, however, the safety of
high doses of curcumin in humans. Only one micellar
delivery system, which enhanced curcumin bioavailability
in all tested subjects, was superior to all hitherto reported
formulations [11]. This micellar curcumin was used in the
in vivo experiments in this study. The micellar vehicle is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a surfactant-based system to enhance the bioavailability
for poorly soluble compounds for oral administration.
However, the underlying mechanisms governing
absorption from lipid and surfactant based formulations are
not yet fully understood; however, release of compound
is believed to take place either by partitioning from the

intact vehicle, also referred to as interfacial transfer, or
by degradation of the vehicle driving the compound
out. The micelles theirselves do not enter the circulation
[40]; their main role is a safe transport of the drug to
the intestine, where the micelles are emulgated and then
shattered while the drug itself is released and adsorbed by
the cells of the small intestine. The administered oral dose
of 60 mg/kg bodyweight (BW) was lower than in other
reports (500 mg/kg BW, respectively 1000 mg/kg BW )
[27, 41]. The resulting serum concentrations of curcumin
were high, but decreased rapidly with time. Five hours
after oral curcumin feeding the mean serum concentration
was decreased to less than 25% of the 2-hour value. In
the organs, curcumin concentrations were heterogeneous.
The standard deviations of the measurements were
high, but it is of interest that the curcumin content in the
tumors was higher than in the liver samples. We could
show that the micellar galenics have overcome the oftenreported poor bioavailability of curcumin and relevant
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

concentrations were obtained in liver tumor tissue, and
lowest concentration in the brain. Severe side effects,
however, were not observed.
To assess the effects of curcumin on hepatoma cells,
the sensitivity of HC-AFW1 and HepG2 cells to native and
micellar curcumin was determined in vitro. As expected,
incubation with curcumin led to a decrease in cell viability
in both cells lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
The calculated IC50 values are in agreement with several
literature reports on the effects of curcumin in adult HCC
models [42, 43]. Further, we combined curcumin with
CDDP. The combination of curcumin with CDDP resulted
in strong additive effects on cell viability in both cell
lines. Similar effects of this combination were described
for other cancer cells, but not for hepatoma cells yet [44].
This is of particular importance, as a number of studies
provided evidence for protective properties of curcumin
against CDDP-induced neurotoxicity, ototoxicity and
nephrotoxicity [45]. In HC-AFW1 cells, primary tumor

and xenografts, beta-catenin is predominantly localized
in the nuclei [13]. In this study, we observed a shift
from nuclear beta-catenin towards cytoplasmic and
membranous beta-catenin under curcumin administration
in both cell lines in vitro. A recently published metaanalysis pointed out that accumulated nuclear and
membranous beta-catenin in adult HCC is an independent
factor for poor prognosis and deep invasion [46]. The
significant increase of beta-catenin, NFkB, and cyclin
D1 depicts one of the mechanisms curcumin works in
hepatoma cells. Physiologically a large proportion of
beta-catenin is part of a complex of proteins such as
e-cadherin that constitute adherens junctions between
cells. Excess of cytoplasmatic β-catenin is phosphorylated
and proteasomal degraded. In the presence of Wnt, the
Axin-mediated phosphorylation/degradation of β-catenin
is disrupted, allowing β-catenin to accumulate in the
nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional factor for Wnt
responsive genes, such as Cyclin D1. NFkB also acts
as a transcriptional co-factor, e.g. for cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2). COX-2 also is a risk factor in carcinogenesis of
HCC, further analyses on COX-2 amounts in our model
are outstanding. [47].
Curcumin alone did not have any significant
influence on AFP concentrations or tumor volume in
vivo. In contrast to our findings, some studies described
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

significant reduction of subcutaneous HCC after
intraperitoneal curcumin treatment [48–50]. One study
even described a significant reduction of the relative
areas of orthotopic tumors [50]. But in these studies,
treatment with curcumin started early after tumor cell
injection without any control of tumor growth before
treatment [48, 49, 50]. Furthermore, intraperitoneal
injection of curcumin circumvents the gastrointestinal
barrier and thus facilitates significantly higher tissue
concentrations than following oral administration [26].
Tumor volume is an unreliable marker of tumor activity
as even large tumors may consist of high amounts of
necrotic areas. Additionally, in orthotopic models,
tumor volume measurements are unreliable due to the
multinodular growth and difficulty of exact recording.
Although the diagnostic value of AFP is questioned,
AFP measurement is still the standard diagnostic marker
for HCC [51]. In literature, there is no data provided
concerning AFP concentrations before and after treatment
with curcumin [48–50]. Therefore, the curcumin effects
in the above mentioned studies show a preventive effect
of curcumin rather than a therapeutic effect. In our model,
the combination of curcumin with CDDP treatment
significantly decreased AFP concentrations. Tumor
volumes were also lower under combination treatment,
but due to high variance, this was not significant. In a
40686

Oncotarget

model of head and neck cancer a significant reduction of
tumor volume was described after combination of CDDP
with a curcumin analogue (H-4073), but also after H-4073
alone [52].
In conclusion, oral administered micellar curcumin
has a good bioavailability and enriches in hepatocellular
tumor tissue. The decrease of AFP levels in tumor bearing
mice is promising for the use of additive micellar curcumin
in the treatment of children with HCC. Possible ways of
action in hepatocellular carcinoma cells are the inhibition
of the NFkB-, and the Wnt/beta-catenin-pathway, resulting
in cyclin D1 decrease.

Cells were washed 3 times in PBS with 2% Tween-20 and
incubated with anti-goat Cy3 (1:200) secondary antibody
for 1 hour. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:2000). Then
cells were mounted with mounting medium after 3 times
of washing. Confocal-style three-dimensional imaging
was performed using an Axio imager 2 microscope with
ApoTome system (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images
were processed using AxioVision 4.8.1 software.

Proliferation assay
HepG2 and HC-AFW were cultured in 96-well
plates (Becton Dickinson GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany)
at a low density (5.000 cells/100μl), and high density
(25.000 cells/100 μl). Cells were treated with 6 different
concentrations of CDDP around IC50 (0,3125–10 μg/
mL) [54]. Experiments were repeated with fibroblasts
and native curcumin, micellar curcumin, and unloaded
micelles, as well as curcumin in combination with CDDP,
respectively. Drugs solutions were prepared shortly
before administration. Cell viability was determined after
48 h by colorimetric MTT [3-(4.5-dimethyl- thiazol2-yl)-2.5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide] assay (SigmaAldrich, Munich, Germany). The assay was performed as
descripted before [15]. Dose- dependent viability curves
were computed by sigmoidal curves with variable slope
to determine IC50 using the GraphPad Prism Software.
For further analysis, the relative viability was assessed and
the IC50 values for each drug administered alone, or in
combination with a fixed concentration of curcumin were
established from the concentration-effect curves. The IC50
values of co-treatment were divided by the IC50 value of
each drug in the absence of the other drug. In a graphical
presentation, the straight line connecting the IC50 values
of the two agents when applied alone corresponds to
additivity, or independent effects of both agents. Values
below this line indicate synergy; values above this line
indicate antagonism [55]

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs and phytochemicals
The native curcumin powder (Jupiter Leys, Cochin,
Kerala State, India) used in all formulations contained
82% curcumin, 16% demethoxycurcumin (DMC), and
2% bis- demethoxycurcumin (BDMC). Curcumin micelles
were composed of 7% curcumin powder (equivalent
to 6% curcumin) and 93% Tween-80 (Kolb, Hedingen,
Switzerland) and were manufactured by AQUANOVA
AG (Darmstadt, Germany) [11] . All percentages refer to
weight. The cytotoxic agent cisplatin (CDDP) was used
as drug formulation (Neocorp AG, Weilheim, Germany).

Cells and cell culture
The cell line HepG2 (trabecular type, LGC
Promochen, HB8065, Salisbury, United Kingdom) was
initially declared as pHCC cell line, meanwhile, they
are classified as hepatoblastoma cell line [53, 14]. The
cell line HC-AFW-1 originates from a pHCC [13]. Cells
were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FCS, Biochrom), 1%
Penicillin/Streptomycin (Biochrom), and 1% L-glutamine
(Biochrom). Cell plastic ware was purchased from
Greiner, Essen, Germany. For in vivo experiments, cells
were resuspended in sterile PBS without FCS and injected
into mice (see animal study).

Real time PCR
To determine the mRNA abundance of the betacatenin, cyclin D1 and NFkappaB, total cellular RNA
was extracted from human pHCC cell lines HepG2
(trabecular type, LGC Promochen, HB8065, Salisbury,
UnitedKingdom) and HC-AFW1 [11] using the RNeasyMinikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After DNAse digestion
approximately 2.5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed
to cDNA using High capacity cDNA reverse transcription
kit (Life technologies, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR
was applied on the CFX96 Real-Time System (Biorad)
using 500 nM forward and reverse primer and 2x GoTaq®
qPCR Master Mix (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI,
USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cycling
conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for

Immunocytochemistry
For immunocytochemistry of beta-catenin, 3 × 10E4
cells were cultured on chamber slides (NUNC). For better
cell adherence, slides were coated with Poly-D-lysine
(Sigma-Aldrich). Each chamber was filled with 3 × 10E4
cells in 100 μl culture media and incubated overnight.
After 24 hours incubation of 0.05 μM curcumin cells were
15 minutes fixed in acetone-methanol (1:1) at -20°C. Then
cells were permeabilized with PBS supplemented with 2%
Tween-20. The staining was performed with a polyclonal
anti-rabbit beta-Catenin antibody (1:500, Cytomed).

were taken weekly from the retro-orbital plexus of CO2/
O2-anaesthetized mice. The tumor marker human AFP
was measured weekly in serum using an ELISA Kit (DRG
Instruments, Marburg, Germany) and expressed in IU/
mL. Therapy started when AFP serum concentrations
were > 5 U/mL. Three weeks after the beginning of
therapy, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation in
CO2 anesthesia. Intraperitoneal organs, lungs, and brains
were exposed and macroscopically assessed for existence
of tumors. Tumors were counted and each tumor diameter
(d) measured. The volume of each tumor nodule per
mouse was calculated by the formula volume = 1/6 πd3
and then summated. A portion of each tumor was fixed in
4% buffered formaldehyde and processed for histological
analysis. Other organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C.

Blood sampling and processing
For the determination of plasma curcuminoid
concentrations (curcumin, bis-demethoxycurcumin
(BDMC), and demethoxycurcumin (DMC)), blood
was collected from mice of the curcumin and curcumin
+ CPPD groups 2, 3, and 5 h after the last curcumin
administration. Different mice were used for each time
point. Blood was collected in EDTA tubes (Sarstedt AG &
Co, Nümbrecht, Germany) and immediately centrifuged
(1008 × g, 10 min, 4°C). The obtained plasma samples
were stored at -80°C until further analysis.

Mice
NOD/LtSz-scid/IL-2Rgamma(null) mice (NSG
mice) were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld,
Germany) and bred in our facility. Sterilized food and
water were accessible ad libitum. For inclusion in the
animal study, a minimum body weight of 20 g and a
minimum age of 6 weeks were required. Both, male and
female mice were used with systematic allocation to the
experimental groups. The animal study to assess tumor
establishment and treatment efficacy was in accordance
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(NIH publication 86–23, revised 1985) and in compliance
with local regulations and approved by the responsible
authority (Regierungspräsidium Tübingen, K 6/13).

Organ lysates and processing
Thawed mouse brain, liver, tumor, kidney, lung,
and heart was weighed into 2 mL tubes and homogenized
in 200 μL 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0–4.5)
containing 1.6% EDTA (48.8 μmol/L) and 2.5% ascorbic
acid (25 μmol/L) using a Miccra D-1 homogeniser (ART
Prozess- & Labortechnik GmbH & Co. KG, Müllheim,
Germany) at 18,000 rpm. Curcumin was extracted and
reconstituted as described below.

Animal study
For induction of intrahepatic pHCC tumor growth,
47 mice received 2 × 106 HC-AFW-1 cells into the spleen
before splenectomy, similar to the recently described
orthotopic hepatoblastoma model [56]. By the increase
of serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) > 5 U/mL, mice were
randomly assigned to one of four groups: control (n = 13;
no treatment); curcumin (n = 10; daily administration of
micellar curcumin by pipetting a glucose-micellar-curcuminsolution, 60 mg/Kg body weight, 5 days a week for three
weeks); CDDP (n = 10; intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg/
kg bodyweight on days 1 and 2), and curcumin + CDDP
(n = 10; combination therapy consisting of intraperitoneal
injections of CDDP on days 1 and 2 and oral gavage of
curcumin micelles on 5 days a week for three weeks).

Curcumin detection in plasma and organ lysates
Curcumin, BDMC, and DMC in plasma and tissues
were extracted using a modified method of Heath et al.,
as described elsewhere [11]. One-hundred μL of plasma
or tissue sample homogenates were incubated with 1000
U β-glucuronidase (from Helix pomatia, Sigma, St.
Louis, USA) dissolved in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer
(pH 4.0–4.5) at 37°C under agitation. Afterwards, 1 mL
extraction solvent (95% ethyl acetate, 5% methanol, Carl
Roth GmbH+Co.KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added and
vortex-mixed. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged
(10,500 x g, 5 min, 4°C) and supernatants collected. This
step was repeated twice. The organic layer was evaporated
to dryness using an RVC 2–25 CDplus centrifugal
evaporator (Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen

GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany). Samples were
re-suspended in 150 μL methanol, vortex-mixed, left
in the dark for 10 min, and vortex-mixed again, and
then transferred to an HPLC vial. Curcuminoids were
quantified on a Jasco HPLC system (Jasco GmbH,
Gross-Umstadt, Germany) with a fluorescence detector
(excitation wavelength 426 nm, emission wavelength 536
nm) and separated on a Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ column
(150 mm x 4 mm, 3 μm particle size; Dr. Maisch GmbH,
Ammerbuch, Germany) maintained at 40°C. The mobile
phase consisted of 52% deionised water (adjusted to
pH 3 with perchloric acid), 34% acetonitrile, and 14%
methanol and was delivered at a flow rate of 1.4 mL/min.
Curcuminoids were quantified against external standard
curves (curcumin, purity ≥ 97.2%, CAS # 458–37-7;
DMC, purity ≥ 98.3%, CAS # 22608–11-13; BDMC,
purity ≥ 99.4%, CAS # 24949–16-0; Chromadex, Irvine,
USA).

Statistics
For statistical analyses, SPSS (Version 22.0) was
used. Decision for parametric or non-parametric tests was
made after Shapiro-Wilk testing for low numbers of data.
To achieve normal distribution, data were transformed to
the base-10 logarithm. In case of normal distribution, data
are given as means and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Comparisons of AFP values and curcumin concentrations
were performed by one-way analyses of variance
(ANOVA) with Bonferroni posthoc test. A p-value of 5%
or lower was considered to be statistically significant.
Statistical uncertainty was expressed as Clopper-Pearson
95% confidence interval (CI95%).
