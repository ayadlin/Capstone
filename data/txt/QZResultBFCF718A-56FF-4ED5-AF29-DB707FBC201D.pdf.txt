BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen therapy is reported to increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). To the authors’ knowledge, it is not yet known whether the risk changes with the
amount of time elapsed since the initial tamoxifen prescription. This information would be valuable in identifying patients at high risk for DVT/PE. METHODS: The relation between timing of tamoxifen use and venous thromboembolism risk was examined. The study population of 16,289 women was identified from the
clinical database of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group. It included women diagnosed with International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stage I or stage II estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer between
1990 and 2004 at ages 45 to 69 years. Risks, risk ratios (RRs), and crude and adjusted hazards ratios were
calculated for each of the first 5 years after breast cancer surgery and then cumulatively over the next 5
years. RESULTS: The 5-year risk of DVT/PE was 1.2% for women receiving tamoxifen and 0.50% for women
not receiving tamoxifen. Women treated with tamoxifen were at a higher risk for DVT/PE during the first 2
years after exposure (RR, 3.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.1-6.0). Subsequently, their risk was not
found to be substantially increased (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.88-2.5). Older women taking tamoxifen appeared to
be at higher risk than younger women during the first 2 years of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of
the current study suggest that the first 2 years after the initiation of tamoxifen therapy may be the most

KEY WORDS: tamoxifen, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolism.

The association between venous thromboembolism (VTE) and cancer has been known for nearly 150
years. At autopsy, VTE is found in >50% of cancer patients.1 Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor
(ER) modulator, effectively prevents breast cancer recurrence among women with estrogen-positive
tumors.2 Although the pathogenesis is complex, there is strong and consistent evidence from clinical trials
that tamoxifen use is a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) in
breast cancer patients. Estimates of the risk ratio (RR) of thromboembolic events range from 1.3 to 7.0.2-6

Tamoxifen and Risk of DVT/PE/Hernandez et al

Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and comorbid diseases such
as hypertension and diabetes increase the risk of DVT/PE
among tamoxifen users.7,8
Because many trials that established the association
between tamoxifen and DVT/PE were conducted in
selected populations with short-term follow-up, it is important to examine the association in a clinical setting
over the longer term. In addition, because tamoxifen has
been shown recently to have a role in preventing breast
cancer,9 understanding its risk profile is essential to weighing its benefits against associated risks.
The objective of the current study was to expand
current knowledge by using a large population-based
cohort of breast cancer patients with nearly complete case
ascertainment and long follow-up to estimate the risks
and hazards ratios (HRs) of developing DVT/PE. The
study also examines the potential of other risk factors for
thromboembolic events to modify tamoxifen’s effect on
the risk of DVT/PE.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Women eligible for the study were diagnosed with International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stage I or stage II
estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer between 1990
and 2004 at ages 45 to 69 years, as reported to the Danish
Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) clinical database. We linked the study population to the Danish
National Registry of Patients (NRP) covering all Danish
hospitals to obtain information regarding venous thromboembolism occurrence and comorbidities, using each
patient’s central personal registry (CPR) number. The
CPR number is a unique identification number assigned
to all Danish residents alive on or born after April 1, 1968
or at the time of immigration.10 Since 1977, the NRP has
recorded the CPR number of the patient, dates of hospital
admission and discharge, surgical procedure(s) performed, and up to 20 diagnoses, classified according to
International Classification of Disease-8 (ICD-8) codes
for events occurring before 1994 and ICD-10 codes for all
subsequent events. Outpatient and emergency room data
have been available since 1994. Study participants were
followed until December 31, 2005.

Data Collection
For each patient, the following demographic information
was collected from the DBCG: age, year of breast cancer
surgery, height and weight (to calculate body mass index),
county of residence, and hospital of diagnosis, as well as
tumor characteristics (stage, size, morphology, and laterality). The prescribed treatment protocol was also collected,
as well as the start and stop dates for tamoxifen, if available. Data regarding comorbidities were obtained from
the NRP.

Statistical Analysis
Tamoxifen use was defined as a dichotomous variable,
ascertained from DBCG records as a component of a
patient’s prescribed breast cancer treatment protocol. The
tamoxifen group was comprised of women receiving any
treatment that included tamoxifen, and the unexposed
group was defined as women undergoing all treatments
excluding tamoxifen. The outcomes of interest were
DVT/PE (ICD-8 and -10 codes 45,099; 45,100; DI260;
DI269; DI269A; DI801; DI802; DI802B; DI803; and
DI803E). Age, surgical procedures (other than breast cancer surgery), metastatic tumors other than breast cancer,
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, diabetes, stroke, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure were
assessed at baseline as potential confounders.
Analyses were restricted to women with no existing
cardiovascular disease (defined using ICD-8 and ICD-10
codes) as of the date of breast cancer surgery. Descriptive
analyses compared demographics, breast cancer characteristics, and comorbidities among tamoxifen-treated and
untreated women. Follow-up was initiated 3 months after
the surgery date (the average time between the date of
surgery and the start of tamoxifen therapy). Follow-up
ended on December 31, 2005. Risks of events were analyzed individually by year for the first 5 years of follow-up,
and then cumulatively for Years 1 to 5. RRs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated as estimates of
the association between tamoxifen therapy and incident
thromboembolic events. Numbers needed to treat were
calculated as the inverse of the risk difference. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate crude
HRs and adjusted HRs controlling for confounding, for
Years 1 to 5 individually, and for Years 5 to 10 taken

together. We tested the proportional hazards assumption
by adding a covariate to the model to represent the interaction between exposure and the log of survival time. The
assumption of proportional hazards was satisfied for all
models.
Interactions between tamoxifen therapy and chemotherapy were examined using proportional hazards models, with women unexposed to tamoxifen serving as the
reference group. Crude and adjusted HRs were estimated
for those patients receiving tamoxifen and chemotherapy,
and those receiving tamoxifen only. The assumption of
proportional hazards was satisfied for all interaction models. We also examined departure from the additive effects
of tamoxifen therapy and age. Women were categorized as
aged 50 years or aged >50 years. Risks, risk differences,
and the interaction contrast were calculated.11
All analyses were performed using SAS statistical
software (version 9; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Final Sample
After excluding 515 (3.0%) women with pre-existing
cardiovascular disease, 16 (0.09%) women who died
before the initiation of follow-up, and 262 (1.5%) women
with missing information on assigned treatment protocol,
the study population was comprised of 16,289 women.
Tamoxifen exposure was distributed almost equally
among subgroups, with 8232 tamoxifen-treated women
and 8057 untreated women in the study.

Descriptive Data
The median follow-up time was 4.0 years, with a minimum of 0 years and a maximum of 14.5 years. The distributions of demographic variables between the exposed
and unexposed groups of women were similar, including
baseline comorbidity levels (Table 1). However, exposed
women were younger and more likely to have their surgery performed in earlier years than unexposed women.
As expected, women receiving tamoxifen were more likely
to have positive lymph node status or a grade 2 or grade 3
tumor. Nearly all women who were excluded from the
analysis due to a missing treatment protocol assignment
variable were aged <55 years.

DVT/PE
As shown in Table 2, tamoxifen therapy increased the
risk of DVT/PE. The 5-year risk was 1.2% for women
receiving tamoxifen and 0.50% for women not receiving
tamoxifen, yielding a RR of 2.4 (95% CI, 1.6-3.4).
However, there was a decreasing trend in additional
risk conferred by tamoxifen therapy from Year 1 to Year
5 of follow-up. During the first 2 years, women taking
tamoxifen had approximately 3.5 times the risk of
DVT/PE as women not receiving tamoxifen. During
the next 3 years of follow-up (Years 3-5), the risk was
1.5 times higher for women taking tamoxifen. Figure 1
shows that women treated with tamoxifen had a sharper
rise in incident DVT/PE episodes (steeper slope)
during the first 2 years of follow-up compared with unexposed women. The cumulative incidence curves then
become nearly parallel, indicating no substantially
increased risk in later years. Therefore, the number needed
to treat to yield 1 thromboembolic event increased from
Year 1 to Year 5. In Year 1, 319 women needed to be
treated to produce 1 additional case of DVT/PE, but by
Year 5, 4303 women needed to be treated to result in 1
additional case.
The same decreasing trend was revealed in both the
crude and adjusted HRs (Table 3) when proportional hazards regression was used to model each of the first 5 years
of follow-up individually and then Years 5 to 10 taken together. During the overall initial 5-year period, 97 events
occurred in the tamoxifen group and 40 events occurred
in the unexposed group, yielding a crude HR of 2.8 (95%
CI, 1.9-4.0) and an adjusted HR of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.73.6). However, the rate was substantially elevated only in
Years 1 and 2, with adjusted HRs of 3.5 (95% CI, 1.67.5) and 3.4 (95% CI, 1.7-7.0), respectively. There was
no increased risk of DVT/PE noted during Years 5 to 10
(HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.69-1.9), conditional on survival
until Year 5.

Duration of Tamoxifen Use
Of the women treated with tamoxifen, 5.1%, 14%, 8.8%,
and 72% were assigned to a 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, and
5-year treatment duration, respectively. The analysis was
repeated excluding women prescribed less than a 5-year
course of tamoxifen to examine whether protocol

(14%) were also treated with chemotherapy. When these
exposures were included in an adjusted proportional hazards model (Table 4), women treated with tamoxifen only
(HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.0-5.7) and women treated with tamoxifen and chemotherapy (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.92-9.6)
were found to be at similar risk of DVT/PE.
Our analyses provided evidence of an important
interaction between age and tamoxifen therapy. In Years 1
to 2, the risk of DVT/PE among women aged >50 years
(8.8 of 1000) was higher than that which could be
accounted for by the additive effects of age and tamoxifen
therapy. The latter would have predicted a risk of only 4.4
of 1000. In Years 3 to 5, the risk of DVT/PE among these
older women (5.4 of 1000) was slightly lower than
expected given the additive effects of age and tamoxifen
therapy, which would have predicted a risk of 5.7 of 1000
(Table 5).

DISCUSSION
Consistent with previous trials,2-6 we found that tamoxifen therapy increases the risk for DVT and PE. Women
receiving this therapy were at approximately 2.5 times
greater risk during the first 5 years after breast cancer surgery. However, we also found a decreasing trend in the
tamoxifen effect by duration of therapy, with the first 2
years after the initiation of therapy constituting the period
of greatest increased risk. Risk during the following 3
years was not found to be substantially increased. The validity of our findings depends ultimately on the quality of
the discharge diagnoses. The validity is high, because the
predictive value of a discharge diagnosis of PE has been
reported to be 90% in administrative databases, and
slightly lower for DVT.12

and pulmonary embolism for first 5 years among breast cancer patients by exposure to tamoxifen (Tam) is shown.

Our estimates of the HR for DVT/PE were
adjusted for many important risk factors, including
cancer (other than breast) and chemotherapy. The
association between cancer and DVT/PE appears to be
related to the prothrombotic responses of the host to
cancer, such as inflammation and necrosis, as well as
the clot-promoting mechanisms of the tumor cells
themselves, including the production of procoagulant
and the release of proinflammatory cytokines.13 Chemotherapy has also been shown to be related to DVT/
PE, with 5-year risks in breast cancer patients treated
with placebo, tamoxifen, and tamoxifen plus chemotherapy reported to be 0.2%, 0.9%, and 4.2%, respectively.7 Due to the older age of patients in the current
study cohort, the confounding role of pregnancy likely
did not play a substantial role in our findings. Because
we were comparing a relatively homogenous group of
breast cancer patients, substantial residual confounding
from other covariates such as total hip and knee

replacement, trauma and spinal cord injury, certain
concomitant medications, and a sedentary lifestyle is
unlikely, but cannot be excluded.14 An additional important factor to consider is confounding by indication. Physicians may selectively prescribe tamoxifen to
women without other major risk factors for DVT/PE.
This prescribing pattern would likely bias our results
toward the null, because the untreated group would
have a higher baseline risk of thromboembolic events.
Although existing evidence for a causal association
between tamoxifen and DVT/PE is strong, to our knowledge the current study is one of the first to suggest that the
RR decreases with time after initiation of therapy, with
the first 2 years being the most hazardous, and with only a
slightly increased risk during Years 3 to 5. A review of trials comparing 5 versus 1 to 2 years of tamoxifen use also
indicated that there was little effect of longer treatment on
the number of deaths attributed to thromboembolism.2
The same timing of excess risk has been shown for tamoxiCancer

fen in a preventive setting. Decensi et al reported an HR
of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.02-2.63) for VTE among patients taking tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention, compared
with those not receiving tamoxifen. All excess VTEs due
to tamoxifen occurred within the first 18 months after
randomization. However, the excess stemmed entirely
from superficial phlebitis of the legs, not DVT or PE.8
Because the current study had nearly 3 times as many subjects, we may have been able to detect more DVT/PE
events.
A decreasing trend in HRs for VTEs has also been
found for estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and VTE
risk. On the basis of data from the Women’s Health Initiative, Curb et al found that the VTE risk was highest in
the first 2 years of ERT (HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.24-6.27),
compared with Years 3 to 5 (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.692.01).15 Because tamoxifen has estrogen agonist effects in
some tissues, it is not surprising that our results parallel
these findings.

DVT/PE indicates deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Our evaluation of interactions revealed that adjuvant therapy given along with tamoxifen may alter the
risk of VTE during the relevant risk period of the first
2 years of treatment. However, due to small numbers
of patients at risk in some of the strata and resulting
wide 95% CIs, these results should be interpreted with
caution. The analysis of interaction between age and
tamoxifen demonstrated a departure from additivity in
2 different directions, depending on the risk period
examined. During the first 2 years after treatment initiation, older women (aged >50 years) were at greater
risk of DVT/PE than would be expected from the
effect of age and tamoxifen alone. In Years 3 to 5,
older women were found to be at a lower risk than
would be expected from the effect of age and tamoxifen alone. Therefore, age and treatment appear to
work together to decrease the risk of the outcome in
this time period. These results further indicate an important difference between the risk periods: tamoxifen
increases risk only during the first 2 years of
treatment.
Because the first 2 years appear to play an important
role in the risk of DVT/PE among breast cancer patients
taking tamoxifen, close monitoring for thromboembolic
events might best be undertaken during these years. Less
frequent surveillance then may be sufficient. Surveillance
for DVT/PE, including ultrasound examination and
D-dimer measurement, is reported to be highly predictive
and cost-efficient.14 Because the majority of patients with
4448

acute PE who receive adequate anticoagulant therapy survive, surveillance, diagnosis, and rapid therapy are crucial
and effective for high-risk patients.
It is important to establish the risk period for VTEs
to formulate guidelines for prescribing tamoxifen and
monitoring for cardiovascular events in both the preventive and adjuvant setting. In an editorial, Goldhaber
recommended that the prevention of breast cancer
should take precedence over the risk of venous thromboembolism, suggesting that women with a high risk
of developing DVT should take systemic anticoagulation
concomitantly with tamoxifen.16 Risk factors for VTE
among women receiving tamoxifen include surgery,
immobilization, or fracture within the previous month.17
Atherosclerotic risk factors, including older age, higher
body mass index, elevated blood pressure, high total cholesterol, smoking, and a family history of coronary heart
disease, also have been shown to increase the risk of VTE
among tamoxifen users.8 Therefore, in addition to anticoagulation treatment, it may be important to educate
patients regarding the importance of modifying risk factors for DVT/PE, including obesity, cigarette smoking,
and hypertension.
Understanding the risk associated with tamoxifen
therapy is increasingly important in the era of aromatase
inhibitors (AIs). Risk/benefit profiles need to be evaluated
for both therapies. AIs do not appear to have the same
thrombotic risks as tamoxifen. One study demonstrated
that patients treated with AIs had half the risk of

thrombotic events compared with those treated with
tamoxifen.18 However, AIs are contraindicated for premenopausal women, as well as for postmenopausal women
with poor bone health. In addition, some women may
decline AIs because of cost.19-21 Tamoxifen remains the
most important adjuvant therapy for premenopausal breast
cancer patients and is an important adjuvant therapy for
postmenopausal women, alone or in sequence with an AI.
Further understanding the cardiovascular risks and
benefits associated with tamoxifen will help physicians individualize treatment for their breast cancer patients, and
may even assist in decision making concerning the use of
tamoxifen, AIs, or a sequential therapy. The results of the
current study indicate that women may be most susceptible to DVT/PE during the first 2 years of tamoxifen therapy—the time when targeted monitoring for VTEs is
most needed.
