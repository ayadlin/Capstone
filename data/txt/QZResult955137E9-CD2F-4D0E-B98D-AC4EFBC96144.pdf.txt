Abstract
Greater than 40% of breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen exhibit de novo or acquired tumor resistance. Recent
clinical evidence indicates that loss of expression of HER4 is
an independent marker for tamoxifen resistance. In direct
corroboration with clinical observations, suppression of HER4
expression in the tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 and T47D breast
tumor cell lines resulted in resistance to tamoxifen-induced
apoptosis. Furthermore, HER4 expression was lost in three
independent MCF-7 models of acquired tamoxifen resistance.
The HER4 intracellular domain (4ICD) is an independently
signaling nuclear protein that functions as a potent ERA coactivator. In addition, mitochondrial 4ICD functions as a
proapoptotic BH3-only protein. Tamoxifen disrupts an estrogen-driven interaction between ERA and 4ICD while promoting mitochondrial accumulation of the 4ICD BH3-only
protein. BCL-2 inhibition of tamoxifen-induced apoptosis
and tamoxifen activation of BAK, independent of BAX, further supports a role for 4ICD during tamoxifen-induced
apoptosis. Finally, reintroduction of HER4, but not HER4 with
a mutated BH3 domain, restores tamoxifen sensitivity to
tamoxifen-resistant TamR cells in a xenograft model. Clinically, breast cancer patients with tumor expression of nuclear
4ICD responded to tamoxifen therapy with no clinical failures
reported after 14 years of follow-up, whereas 20% of patients
lacking nuclear 4ICD expression succumbed to their disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Our identification of the
HER4/4ICD BH3-only protein as a critical mediator of tamoxifen action provides a clinically important role for 4ICD
in human cancer and reveals a potential tumor marker to
predict patient response to tamoxifen therapy. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The selective estrogen receptor (ERa) modulator tamoxifen has
been used as a single agent for the treatment of ERa(+) breast
cancers since 1971. Currently, tamoxifen is the most commonly
prescribed antiestrogen therapy and is uniquely effective in the
treatment of premenopausal woman with ERa(+) breast tumors.
Unfortunately, de novo and acquired tumor resistance to tamo-

xifen are serious clinical problems. In fact, nearly 30% of patients
with ERa(+) breast tumors fail to respond to tamoxifen and up
to 40% of initial responders relapse and succumb to their disease
(1–3). Because the exact molecular basis for the mechanism of
tamoxifen action remains unclear, clinicians lack reliable clinicopathologic indicators to identify patients likely to fail tamoxifen therapy.
Elegant structural studies have shown that tamoxifen binding to
ERa not only results in competitive inhibition of estrogen binding
but tamoxifen also alters ERa structure, thereby occluding
coactivator interactions with ERa essential for estrogen-stimulated
tumor cell proliferation (4). As predicted by this mechanism of
action, tamoxifen treatment of ERa(+) tumors results in cytostatic
effects, reducing breast tumor cell proliferation in part by arresting
cell cycle progression (5).
Less clear however is a mechanism to explain the clinical
observation that tumors from patients undergoing tamoxifen
treatment exhibit increased levels of apoptosis (6, 7). In addition,
tamoxifen-induced tumor regression observed in multiple preclinical xenograft models cannot be explained by cytostatic effects
alone, suggesting a role for apoptosis in these models as well (7). In
multiple experimental systems, tamoxifen induces cytochrome c
release from mitochondria (8, 9), the essential and committed step
of the mitochondrial or intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Although
tamoxifen alters the expression of multiple effectors of the intrinsic
apoptotic cascade consistent with increased cell killing, including
suppression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 and up-regulation of proapoptotic BAX (10–12), the contribution of these alterations to
tamoxifen activity in breast tumors requires clinical verification.
Recent clinical studies have revealed that tumor expression of
the receptor tyrosine kinase HER4/ERBB4 (referred to here as
HER4) improves the overall survival of breast cancer patients with
ERa(+) tumors (13–15), raising the possibility that HER4 influences
patient response to endocrine therapy. HER4 is a unique member
of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and
undergoes proteolytic processing at the cell surface to release a
HER4 intracellular domain (4ICD; ref. 16) that independently
regulates multiple divergent activities in breast tumor cells (17–19).
For example, nuclear 4ICD functions as a potent ERa coactivator,
directly interacting with ligand-associated ERa at promoters of
estrogen response genes and contributing to estrogen-stimulated
proliferation of breast tumor cells (19). In nonmalignant breast
epithelium, nuclear 4ICD regulates differentiation and lactation
in part through transcriptional coactivation of the mammary differentiation factor, STAT5A (20–24).
When excluded from the nucleus, however, cytosolic 4ICD
accumulates within mitochondria (17, 18) and triggers breast
tumor cell apoptosis through the activity of an intrinsic cell-killing
BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain (17). This novel activity for a

receptor tyrosine kinase has been confirmed clinically where we
have shown that cytosolic 4ICD but not membrane-localized HER4
is strongly associated with increased breast tumor apoptosis (17).
Importantly, HER4 regulation of gene expression and apoptosis are
mediated by 4ICD released from the cell surface after proteolytic
processing of HER4 (17–19, 21, 24). The molecular mechanisms
regulating these divergent 4ICD activities are poorly understood.
Here, we show for the first time that 4ICD is an important effector
of tamoxifen-induced apoptosis of breast tumor cells. Our results
are consistent with a mechanism of tamoxifen action involving
tamoxifen disruption of the growth-promoting 4ICD/ERa coactivator complex, thereby unleashing the cell-killing activity of an
untethered 4ICD BH3-only protein.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids. The HER4 constructs used in this study were all derived from
the HER4 JM-a/Cyt1 isoform. The HER4 expression plasmids pHER4-EGFP
and pHER4muBH3-EGFP have been described previously (17, 24) The
plasmid pERa-flag expressing a flag-tagged version of human ERa was
provided by Dr. Brian Rowan (Tulane University, New Orleans, LA). The
BCL-2 expression plasmid pcDNA-BCL2 was provided by the late Dr. Stanley
Korsmeyer (Harvard University, Boston, MA).
To generate a plasmid expressing the HER2 oncogenic isoform HER2D16
(25), the region of HER2 harboring an exon 16 deletion was amplified by
reverse transcription-PCR from BT474 RNA and subcloned into pLXSNHER2 (26) harboring wild-type human HER2 to generate the clone pLXSNHER2D16 using standard procedures. The exon 16 deletion was confirmed
by sequencing. The plasmids pcDNA3-HER2 and pcDNA3-HER2D16 were
generated by subcloning the 4.5 kb Hind III fragment containing the HER2
open reading frame from pLXSN-HER2 or pLXSN-HER2D16, respectively,
into the same sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).
Cell lines. The T47D and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines were
purchased from the American Type Cell Culture and maintained according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7
variants TamR and LCC2 have been described previously (27, 28). The LCC2
cell line provided by Dr. Robert Clarke (Georgetown University, Washington,
DC) and maintained in Modified Eagle’s Medium with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). The MCF-7/HER2D16 cell line was obtained by stably
transfecting MCF-7 cells with pcDNA3-HER2D16 (Invitrogen) using Fugene6
(Roche). Individual transfected colonies were selected in Geneticin
(Invitrogen) and isolated using cloning cylinders. The TamR/Vector,
TamR/HER4, and TamR/muBH3 cell lines were generated by stably
transfecting the TamR cell line with pEGFPN3 (Clontech), pHER4-EGFP
(24), or pHER4muBH3-EGFP (17), respectively. Individual transfected cell
colonies were selected in kanamycin and isolated using cloning cylinders.
Suppression of HER4 expression. To suppress expression of endogenous HER4, T47D or MCF-7 cells were transfected with erbB-4/HER-4 siRNA
SMARTpool using siIMPORTER transfection reagent (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells similarly transfected with Nonspecific Negative Control Pool (Upstate Biotechnology) were
analyzed as RNAi controls.
Assays for apoptosis. Apoptosis was quantitated visually using a Nikon
fluorescent microscope to determine the percentage of cells with
condensed chromatin after 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining.
All samples were prepared in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated
at least thrice. Significant differences between data sets was determined
using the paired Student’s t test. Apoptosis in histologic sections from
paraffin-embedded xenograft tumors was determined using the ApopTag
Plus Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Chemicon International)
exactly as described by the manufacturer. Data are represented as the mean
percentage of terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase–mediated dUTP nickend labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and SE from at least three individual
tumors from each treatment group.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. The HEK-293T cells
were maintained in phenol red–free DMEM containing 5% charcoal-

stripped FBS during the entire immunoprecipitation experiment. Coimmunoprecipitation of ERa and 4ICD was performed by transfecting 5  105
HEK 293T cells cultured in 100-mm dishes with pERa-flag and/or pHER4EGFP using Lipofectamine with Plus reagent (Invitrogen) exactly as
described by the manufacturer. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were treated
with 100 pmol/L 17-h-estradiol alone or in combination with 5 Amol/L
tamoxifen for 1 h. Cell lysates were prepared and 1 mg of lysate were
immunoprecipitated using a-Flag Agarose (Sigma) or rabbit a-HER4 (Cell
Signaling) as described previously (29).
Immunoprecipitates and total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot
as described elsewhere (29) with primary antibodies HER4 (Cell Signaling),
Flag M2 (Sigma), a-tubulin (Upstate Biotechnology), TOM40 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), BAK (Upstate Biotechnology), and BAX (Upstate Biotechnology).
Analysis of isolated mitochondria for 4ICD localization and BAK or
BAX dimerization. T47D cells were cultured in phenol red–free RPMI
containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS for 2 d and then stimulated for
1 h with 50 ng/mL of heregulin-h1 (HRG; R&D Systems), 12 h with 1 Amol/L
staurosporine (Sigma), or 1 h with 100 pmol/L 17-h-estradiol alone or in
combination with 5 Amol/L tamoxifen. Mitochondria were isolated and
analyzed by Western blot for 4ICD localization or for BAK and BAXdimerized activation as described elsewhere (17).
Tumor formation in nude mice. Four- to 5-wk-old NU/NU immunecompromised female mice (Charles-River Laboratories) were implanted s.c.
in the scapular region with a 60-d release 0.72-mg estradiol pellet
(Innovative Research of America) using a precision trochar. Seven days
later, the mice were injected s.c. at two rear flank sites with each injection
site containing 5  106 cells in 100 AL of sterile PBS mixed with 100 AL of
Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences). Tumors were
allowed to develop for 15 d at which time mice were randomized and
implanted with a 60-d release 5-mg tamoxifen pellet (Innovative Research of
America) or a 60-d release 5-mg placebo (Innovative Research of America).
All mice were anesthetized using Isoflurane/Oxigen before surgery. Tumor
size was measured every 3 d using a digital caliper, and tumor volume was
calculated. Statistical analysis of the data set was performed using the
Kruskal-Wallis Test (30).
Immunohistochemical analysis of xenograft tumors. Two hours
before sacrifice, all mice were injected i.p. with 10 AL/g body weight of
BrdUrd Cell Labeling Reagent (Amersham). Tumors were excised, fixed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin using
standard histologic procedures. Immunohistochemical analysis of proliferating cells by BrdUrd incorporation and apoptosis by TUNEL assay have
been described in detail elsewhere (17, 31).
Patient population and HER4 immunohistochemistry. A total of 791
archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tumors from patients
diagnosed at Massachusetts General Hospital between 1976 and 1983 were
used for this study. Follow-up for a mean of 15.6 y was used to determine
patient outcome after surgery and adjuvant intervention. Additional clinical
and pathologic details of this cohort have been described elsewhere (32).
HER4 immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously
(17) using HER4 Ab-4 (Neomarkers; Clone HFR-1) directed against the
carboxyl terminus of human HER4 at a concentration of 4.0 Ag/mL. A tumor
was considered positive for nuclear 4ICD if >10% of tumor nuclei exhibited
positive immunohistochemical staining. Associations between nuclear 4ICD
and patient survival were determined using the Fisher’s exact test.

Results
HER4 expression regulates tamoxifen-induced apoptosis of
ERA(+) breast tumor cells. Several recent clinical studies indicate
that HER4 expression improves the prognosis of patients with
ERa(+) breast tumors (13–15). Because the majority of these
patients would have received endocrine therapy as part of their
therapeutic regimen with tamoxifen being the most commonly
prescribed endocrine therapy, we tested the possibility that HER4
regulates tamoxifen response of ERa(+) breast tumor cells. To this

HER4/4ICD Regulates Tamoxifen Response

end, we examined the effect of tamoxifen cell killing on the ERa(+),
and HER4(+) MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines after RNA
interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of HER4 expression.
Although tamoxifen has cytostatic effects, consistent with other
reports, we observed a dramatic increase in both MCF-7 and T47D
cell killing after treatment with physiologic levels of tamoxifen
(Fig. 1A). Interestingly, suppression of HER4 expression in each cell
line by RNAi pretreatment dramatically inhibited the ability of
tamoxifen to induce apoptosis after 24 hours and completely abolished tamoxifen cell-killing activity after 48 hours (Fig. 1A). These
results implicate HER4 as an important regulator of tamoxifeninduced apoptosis of ERa(+) breast tumor cells and provide a
molecular explanation for the improved prognosis of patients with
ERa(+) tumors that also express HER4 (13–15).
Our results coupled with clinical data suggest that loss of HER4
expression may contribute to tamoxifen refractory breast cancer.
To test this hypothesis, we examined HER4 expression in three
established preclinical cellular models of tamoxifen resistance. The
tamoxifen resistant LCC2 (28) and TamR (27) cell lines were
generated in independent laboratories by continuous exposure of
MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen. The tamoxifen-resistant HER2D16 cell
line was derived in our laboratory by overexpressing an oncogenic
isoform of HER2 in the MCF-7 cell line. When compared with
parental MCF-7 cells, HER4 expression was abolished in each
tamoxifen-resistant cell line examined (Fig. 1B), and as predicted,
each cell line was resistant to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 1C). Taken together, our results strongly implicate HER4 as
an important mediator of tamoxifen-induced cell killing of breast
tumor cells. By extension, loss of HER4 expression may represent a
clinically important mechanism contributing to tamoxifen refractory breast tumors.
Tamoxifen disrupts the ERA/4ICD transcriptional coactivator complex. We next determined the molecular mechanism
underlying the ability of HER4 to regulate tamoxifen response of
breast tumor cells. HER4 is a unique multifunctional member of
the EGFR family that undergoes proteolytic processing at the cell
surface to release the independently signaling 4ICD. We have
shown that 4ICD is a potent ERa coactivator that directly interacts
with ERa (19). Tamoxifen functions, in part, by altering ERa
structure, thereby occluding interactions between ERa and
coactivators. We therefore determined if tamoxifen disrupts the
interaction between ERa and the 4ICD coactivator. Consistent with
our published results (19), 4ICD and ERa were coimmunoprecipitated from transfected HEK 293T cells and the amount of 4ICD/
ERa coimmunoprecipitated complexes was augmented by the
addition of estrogen (Fig. 2, compare 10 and 11). Tamoxifen
treatment, however, disrupted immunoprecipitable 4ICD/ERa
complexes (Fig. 2, compare 11 and 12). These results provide
further evidence that 4ICD functions as a canonical ERa coactivator whose interaction with ERa is disrupted by tamoxifen.
Tamoxifen promotes mitochondrial accumulation of the
4ICD BH3-only protein and activation of the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway. In addition to the coactivator function of
4ICD, we have also shown that 4ICD translocates to mitochondria
where it functions as a proapoptotic BH3-only protein (17, 18).
By disengaging 4ICD coactivator activity, tamoxifen may induce
cell killing of breast tumor cells by serendipitous activation of the
untethered 4ICD BH3-only protein. In response to a specific apoptotic signal, BH3-only proteins initiate cell killing by translocating
to the mitochondria where they promote activation of the apoptotic gateway proteins BAX and BAK (33).

treatment (Fig. 3A). The addition of tamoxifen, however, resulted in
a dramatic increase in 4ICD mitochondrial accumulation (Fig. 3A).
Tamoxifen treatment of MCF-7 or T47D cells did not, however,
alter HER4 expression levels or 4ICD processing when compared
with estrogen-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Taken toge-

ther, these observations suggest that tamoxifen disruption of the
ERa/4ICD coactivator complex results in mitochondrial localization of the untethered 4ICD BH3-only protein.
To confirm that tamoxifen-induced cell killing involved proteolytic processing of HER4 to generate 4ICD, we blocked HER4
processing by incubating T47D and MCF-7 cells with g-secretase

the percentage of cells with condensed nuclei (mean F SE of at least three experiments). C, tamoxifen stimulates dimerized activation of mitochondrial BAK.

inhibitor XXI (Calbiochem) in combination with estrogen and/or
tamoxifen. In both cell lines, tamoxifen-induced apoptosis was
reduced to 17% in the presence of the g-secretase inhibitor (Fig. 3B;
data not shown), suggesting that proteolytic processing of HER4 to
liberate 4ICD is required for tamoxifen action. To confirm that the
cell-killing activity of tamoxifen is regulated by a mechanism
involving the mitochondrial dysfunction pathway, we determined
the ability of antiapoptotic BCL-2 to suppress tamoxifen-induced
apoptosis in T47D cells. BCL-2 suppresses BH3-only proteinmediated mitochondrial dysfunction by interacting with and
sequestering proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (33). Similarly, we
have previously shown that BCL-2 interacts with and suppresses
the apoptotic activity of 4ICD (17). BCL-2 overexpression
completely abolished tamoxifen-induced apoptosis of T47D cells,
implicating a role for a BH3-only protein in tamoxifen-mediated
breast tumor cell killing (Fig. 3B). Similar results were observed
with tamoxifen-treated MCF-7 cells overexpressing BCL-2 (data not
shown). BH3-only proteins initiate mitochondrial dysfunction and
apoptosis through activation of both BAK and BAX mitochondria
pore-forming complexes. Interestingly, 4ICD is unique among BH3only protein family members in that 4ICD mediates cell killing
exclusively through BAK activation, whereas BAX remains unaffected. We therefore examined BAK and BAX-dimerized activation
in T47D cells after tamoxifen treatment. Consistent with our
previous results, stimulation of T47D cells with the HER4 ligand
heregulin, which promotes 4ICD apoptotic activity (17), resulted in
dramatic conversion of monomeric BAK to the activated dimer
form (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S2) but had minimal effect on
BAX dimerization (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly,
tamoxifen also induced significant levels of BAK dimerization but
failed to activate BAX (Fig. 3C and D; Supplementary Fig. S2).
Staurosporine, which activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a
BH3-only protein–dependent manner, was included as a positive
control for BAX dimerization (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these
results provide compelling evidence that tamoxifen-induced cell
killing of breast tumor cells involves mitochondrial dysfunction
mediated by a BAK activating BH3-only protein. Tamoxifeninduced mitochondrial localization of 4ICD coupled with selective
activation of BAK further implicates 4ICD as the critical BH3-only
protein-regulating tamoxifen-induced apoptosis.
HER4 with an intact 4ICD BH3-domain reverts tamoxifen
refractory breast tumor cells to a tamoxifen-sensitive phenotype. We have shown that independently isolated MCF-7 cell line
variants with acquired tamoxifen resistance also exhibit suppressed
HER4 expression (Fig. 1B). To determine if 4ICD BH3 domain
activity can restore tamoxifen sensitivity, wild-type HER4 or HER4
with BH3 domain inactivating mutations (muBH3) were stably
reintroduced into the tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 variant TamR.
Significantly, TamR cells with reintroduced HER4 reverted to a
tamoxifen-sensitive phenotype with levels of tamoxifen-induced
apoptosis equivalent to the parental MCF-7 cells line (Fig. 4A). In
striking contrast, TamR cells expressing HER4-harboring mutations
inactivating BH3 domain–mediated 4ICD cell killing remained
refractory to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4A). Taken together,
these results show that reintroduced HER4 expression can restore
tamoxifen sensitivity and strongly implicate the 4ICD BH3-only
protein as an essential mediator of tamoxifen-regulated apoptosis
of breast tumor cells.
Tamoxifen-induced tumor regression is mediated by the
HER4/4ICD BH3-only protein. We extended our in vitro results to
a xenograft tumor model and determined if HER4 also mediated

tumor regression after tamoxifen treatment. The modified TamR
cell lines were injected into the flanks of estrogen-primed nude
mice and tumors were allowed to develop to f100 mm3. After
15 days, established tumors were exposed to tamoxifen or placebo,
and tumor volumes were recorded during the 21-day experiment.
As expected, the TamR tumors were resistant to tamoxifen treatment with a final tumor volume equivalent to the placebo-treated
TamR tumors (Fig. 4B and C). Although TamR tumors expressing
HER4 continued to grow for 6 days after tamoxifen exposure, these
tumors rapidly regressed by day 9 of tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 4C).
Significantly, TamR tumors expressing HER4 with an inactivated
BH3 domain continued to grow in the presence of tamoxifen
(Fig. 4B and C), providing compelling evidence that the HER4/4ICD
BH3-only protein is a critical regulator of tamoxifen activity in vivo.
TamR cells expressing HER4 or HER4 with a mutated BH3 domain
and treated with placebo both exhibited growth kinetics similar to
tamoxifen-treated TamR/muBH3 tumors (data not shown).
To determine if tumor regression in HER4-expressing TamR cells
was due to increased tumor apoptosis, we examined xenograft
tumors histologically for proliferation by BrdUrd incorporation
and apoptosis by TUNEL. A significant difference in the levels of
tamoxifen-induced apoptosis was observed, with levels of apoptosis in TamR/HER4 tumors >4% compared with <1% observed in
TamR and TamR/muBH3 tumors (Fig. 5A and B). The TamR and
TamR/muBH3 tumors were however highly proliferative with 14%
and 18% of nuclei incorporating BrdUrd, respectively. In contrast,
we rarely observed BrdUrd-positive nuclei in the TamR/HER4
tumors (Fig. 5A and B). These results suggest that TamR/HER4
tumor regression in response to tamoxifen is due to a combination
of increased apoptosis and impaired proliferation.
Nuclear 4ICD expression improves patient response to
tamoxifen therapy. To determine the clinical effect of nuclear
4ICD expression on survival of breast cancer patients treated with
tamoxifen as a single agent, we analyzed HER4 expression in a
cohort of 791 patients. To eliminate complicating and unpredictable
factors associated with a combined therapeutic regimen, we focused
our analysis on ER/PgR(+) patients that were treated with tamoxifen
as a single agent. This is a relatively rare cohort and was limited to
42 patients with 17 patients expressing nuclear 4ICD (Fig. 6B) and
25 patients lacking nuclear 4ICD expression (Fig. 6A). Despite the
small sample size, the results were quite striking with no therapeutic
failures observed in the 17 tamoxifen-treated patients with tumor
expression of nuclear 4ICD (Fig. 6C). In contrast, 20% (5 of 25) of
tamoxifen-treated patients lacking HER4/4ICD tumor expression
succumbed to their disease within 10 years of diagnosis (Fig. 6C).
These data approached significance with a Fisher’s exact test result
of a P value of 0.06. These clinical observations support our
preclinical data and further suggest that tamoxifen disruption of
the nuclear 4ICD and ERa transcriptional complex results in tumor
cell killing mediated by the untethered 4ICD proapoptotic protein.
Our data are in concordance with another recent clinical study
implicating HER4/4ICD expression as an independent tumor marker
for patient response to tamoxifen (34).

Discussion
Despite widespread clinical use for over 30 years, the molecular
regulators of tamoxifen action remain poorly understood. On the
one hand, tamoxifen exerts cytostatic effects on some ER(+) breast
tumors, which can be explained in part by the ability of tamoxifen
to disrupt growth-promoting ERa and coactivator complexes. On

Figure 4. An intact HER4/4ICD proapoptotic
BH3 domain restores tamoxifen sensitivity
in a refractory cell line. A, reintroduction of
HER4 with an intact BH3-domain restores
tamoxifen sensitivity to the TamR cell line.
The MCF-7 tamoxifen-resistant variant TamR
was stably transfected with vector, HER4,
or HER4muBH3 lacking a functional BH3
domain. Each cell line was cultured for 48 h
in phenol red–free MEM containing 5%
charcoal-stripped FBS and then treated
for 24 h with 100 pmol/L 17-h-estradiol
alone or in combination with 5 Amol/L
4-hydroxytamoxifen. Apoptosis was
determined visually in a Nikon fluorescent
microscope by staining the cells with DAPI
and determining the percentage of cells with
condensed nuclei (mean F SE of at least
three experiments). *, significant differences
in each data set as determined by Student’s
t test. B, HER4 with an intact BH3-domain
causes tumor regression in response to
tamoxifen in a xenograft model. Nude mice
implanted with estrogen pellets were injected
with the indicated cell line, and after 15 d,
mice with established tumors were treated
with implanted tamoxifen pellets. After 21 d
of tamoxifen treatment, mice were sacrificed
and photographed. TamR cells expressing
HER4, but not HER4 with a mutated BH3
domain, fully regressed after tamoxifen
treatment. C, xenograft tumor growth
kinetics shows HER4-mediated tumor
regression in response to tamoxifen. The
volume of xenograft tumors was measured
every 3 d before and after tamoxifen treatment
at day 15. Points, mean from at least five
independent tumor sites; bars, SE. TamR
cells expressing HER4, but not HER4 with
a mutated BH3 domain, began to regress
after 6 d of tamoxifen treatment. Growth of
tamoxifen-treated TamR/HER4-induced
tumors was significantly lower than TamR
and TamR/HER4muBH3-induced tumors
(P = 0.043).

the other hand, a molecular mechanism explaining how tamoxifen
disruption of ERa and coactivators contributes to tamoxifeninduced apoptosis of breast tumor cells is less clear. In the current study, we provide multiple lines of experimental evidence,
including a preclinical xenograft model, to implicate the 4ICD BH3only protein as a critical mediator of tamoxifen-induced breast
tumor cell-killing. For example, in the ER(+)/HER4(+) and
tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 and T47D breast tumor cell lines,
de novo tamoxifen resistance was induced in each cell line when
HER4 expression was suppressed using an RNAi strategy. Furthermore, we found that HER4 expression was suppressed in
multiple MCF-7 models of acquired tamoxifen resistance developed
in independent laboratories with different experimental manipulations including continuous tamoxifen exposure (TamR and LCC2)
or HER2 overexpression (HER2D16). Indeed, one of the most
common models of acquired tamoxifen resistance, the MCF-7/
HER18 model developed by the Osborne laboratory, also exhibits
suppressed HER4 expression (35). Significantly, when we reintroduced HER4 but not HER4 with a mutated BH3 domain into the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

TamR MCF-7 variant, tamoxifen sensitivity was restored both
in vitro and in a preclinical xenograft model. Taken together, our
data establishes an important role for the 4ICD BH3 cell-killing
domain in tamoxifen response.
As a cell surface receptor, HER4 must use novel molecular
mechanisms to regulate tamoxifen action. HER4 is a unique
member of the EGFR family and undergoes proteolytic processing at the cell surface to release the 4ICD transcriptional coactivator. Indeed, in multiple experimental systems, the ability of
HER4 to modulate gene expression requires presenilin-dependent
g-secretase cleavage to release the soluble 4ICD transcriptional
regulator (18, 19, 21, 24). We have previously shown that similar
to other ERa coactivators, 4ICD directly interacts with ERa and
binds with ERa at selective estrogen-regulated gene promoters in
an estrogen-dependent manner. Tamoxifen functions in part by
disrupting ERa and coactivator complexes (4). Consistent with
the role of 4ICD as an ERa coactivator, we show here that
tamoxifen significantly impairs basal and estrogen-stimulated
4ICD complex formation with ERa. It remains unclear however if

HER4/4ICD Regulates Tamoxifen Response

tamoxifen disrupts a cytosolic or DNA-bound nuclear ERa/4ICD
complex.
Our current results suggest that disruption of the 4ICD/ERa
transcriptional complex contributes to tumor regression in
response to tamoxifen through activation of the proapoptotic
4ICD BH3 only protein. Indeed, we show that tamoxifen-induced
cell killing can be abolished by overexpression of BCL-2. BCL-2
protects tumor cells from apoptosis by sequestering proapoptotic
BH3-only protein members, thus implicating a role for a BH3-only
protein in tamoxifen cell killing. Importantly, we have previously
shown that 4ICD harbors many of the functional characteristics of
a proapoptotic BH3-only protein member of the BCL 2 family. For
example, when localized to mitochondria, 4ICD induces apoptosis
in a BH3 domain–dependent manner through activation of the
apoptosis gateway protein BAK. In addition, the cell-killing activity
of 4ICD is abolished in cells overexpressing BCL-2 (17). Significantly, we show here that tamoxifen stimulates mitochondrial
accumulation of 4ICD, presumably through disruption of the

associated with an increase in tumor apoptosis and a reduction in proliferation.

analysis. The percentage of BrdUrd- or TUNEL-positive nuclei in random
microscope fields was determined. Columns, mean from at least three different
tumors; bars, SE. The levels of TamR/HER4 tumor proliferation (BrdUrd) and
apoptosis (TUNEL) were significantly different from both TamR and TamR/
muBH3 cells as determined by Student’s t test.

4ICD/ERa transcriptional complex. Subsequent activation of
mitochondrial BAK but not BAX in response to tamoxifen further implicates the 4ICD BH3-only protein as the proapoptotic
mediator of tamoxifen-induced cell killing. Indeed, selective
activation of BAK is a property unique to the 4ICD BH3-only
protein (17). Furthermore, an intact 4ICD BH3 domain was
required for ectopic HER4 to reestablish tamoxifen sensitivity
in a resistant cell line both in vitro and in a xenograft model.
In fact, xenograft tumors of HER4-expressing TamR cells fully
regressed with a significant increase in tumor apoptosis when
compared with control or tumors expressing HER4 with a mutated
4ICD BH3 domain. Taken together, these results provide important
in vitro and preclinical in vivo evidence for 4ICD BH3-domain–
mediated cell-killing activity as an important regulator of tamoxifen response in breast cancer.
Based on our hypothesis that disruption of the nuclear ERa/
4ICD transcriptional complex mediates tamoxifen-induced cell
killing through release of the 4ICD proapoptotic protein, one would
predict that patients with nuclear 4ICD expression will exhibit
improved response to tamoxifen. Our clinical data provide
compelling support for this hypothesis. After 14 years of followup, we have not observed a single failure in our patients whose
tumors express nuclear 4ICD and received tamoxifen as their sole
therapeutic intervention. Activation of the 4ICD BH3-only protein
through disruption of ERa/4ICD transcriptional complexes may
emerge as a common mechanism of action for endocrine therapies
that target ERa function. For example, HER4 expression was also
suppressed in a panel of fulvestrant-resistant breast tumor cell
lines (36). Fulvestrant treatment, which leads to ERa degradation,
may also disengage ERa/4ICD complexes and promote fortuitous
activation of 4ICD cell-killing activity.
There exists a formal possibility that loss of HER4 expression
contributes to tamoxifen resistance through disengaged 4ICD
coactivation of estrogen-regulated genes. However, mutation of the
4ICD BH3 domain failed to affect HER4 stimulation of estrogeninduced gene expression (Supplementary Fig. S1C), whereas this
same functional alteration of HER4 abolished the ability of HER4 to
restore tamoxifen sensitivity in a resistant cell line. These results
further implicate a role for the 4ICD BH3-only protein in tamoxifen
response independent of 4ICD coactivator function.
In summary, we show that suppression of HER4 expression in
multiple breast tumor model systems results in tamoxifen
resistance, and we further show that the proapoptotic BH3 domain
of 4ICD is an important mediator of tamoxifen-induced cell killing
and tumor regression in a preclinical xenograft model. In direct
corroboration with our preclinical data, a recent analysis of
primary breast tumors from patients treated with tamoxifen as
a single agent revealed that suppressed HER4 expression was an
independent tumor marker for tamoxifen resistance in a multivariate analysis (34). Our clinical results indicating a profound
effect of nuclear 4ICD expression on breast cancer patient survival
after tamoxifen treatment further implicates 4ICD as a critical
mediator of tamoxifen activity and as an important tumor marker
for predicting patient response to endocrine therapy. Emerging
evidence suggests that the subcellular distribution of cell-surface
receptors and their intracellular domains has a profound effect
on tumor biology (13, 15, 17, 37, 38). Here, we provide a proofof-hypothesis to support further studies aimed at deciphering
and clinically validating the molecular mechanisms regulating
4ICD subcellular localization and divergent 4ICD activities directly
influencing breast cancer progression and therapeutic response.
