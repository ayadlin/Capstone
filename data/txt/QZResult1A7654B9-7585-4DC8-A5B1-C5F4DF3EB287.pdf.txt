ABSTRACT
The recent finding that MYC-driven cancers are sensitive to inhibition of the
DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, prompted us to investigate the role of DDR
pathway as therapeutic target in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which
frequently overexpresses the MYC oncogene. In a preliminary immunohistochemical
study conducted on 99 consecutive DLBCL patients, we found that about half of
DLBCLs showed constitutive expression of the phosphorylated forms of checkpoint
kinases (CHK) and CDC25c, markers of DDR activation, and of phosphorylated histone
H2AX (γH2AX), marker of DNA damage and genomic instability. Constitutive γH2AX
expression correlated with c-MYC levels and DDR activation, and defined a subset of
tumors characterised by poor outcome. Next, we used the CHK inhibitor PF-0477736
as a tool to investigate whether the inhibition of the DDR pathway might represent a
novel therapeutic approach in DLBCL. Submicromolar concentrations of PF-0477736
hindered proliferation in DLBCL cell lines with activated DDR pathway. These results
were fully recapitulated with a different CHK inhibitor (AZD-7762). Inhibition of
checkpoint kinases induced rapid DNA damage accumulation and apoptosis in DLBCL
cell lines and primary cells. These data suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of
DDR through targeting of CHK kinases may represent a novel therapeutic strategy
in DLBCL.

therapeutic approach, as the International prognostic
index (IPI) risk score (based on clinical variables),
remains the most reliable prognostic tool available in
clinical practice [2]. Interestingly, recent data show that
a significant fraction of DLBCL display chromosomal
segregation defects and aneuploidy, a prominent feature
of instable genomes, and these characteristics have
been demonstrated to correlate with poor prognosis
following conventional R-CHOP chemoimmunotherapy
[6]. Accordingly, whole exome sequencing studies showed
that DLBCLs are characterized by a particularly large
number of genomic aberrations [7]. Moreover a consistent
percentage of DLBCLs are characterized by increased
c-MYC expression [8–10] which is linked mechanistically

INTRODUCTION
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL),
the most common non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
subtype, is characterized by an aggressive clinical
course [1], and standard first line R-CHOP (Rituximab,
Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone)
chemoimmunotherapy results in approximately 60% cure
rates [2].
In the last ten years gene expression profiling has
identified two distinct signatures strongly related to the
outcome and response to therapy, the germinal center (GCB)
B-cell and the activated B-cell (ABC) signatures [3–5],
but this classification did not translate yet in a tailored

to instrinsic genomic instability by a mechanism called
replicative stress, consisting in DNA damage accumulation
during the S phase of the cell cycle [11].
Genomic instability is now considered a hallmark of
cancer, which indicates a tendency toward accumulation
of DNA damage with progressive acquisition of
mutations and genomic abnormalities, favouring cancer
development, metastatic phenotypes and chemoresistance
[11, 12]. Following DNA damage, cells normally respond
by activating the DNA damage repair pathway (DDR),
which results in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or eventually
p53-mediated cell death [13]. The ataxia telangiectasia
mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3related protein (ATR) kinases are activated following
DNA double and/or single strand breaks and in turn
they phosphorylate the downstream targets checkpoint
kinases (CHK) 1 and 2, and the histone H2AX, which
is considered to be a reliable DNA damage marker [13–
15]. CHK1 and CHK2 activation triggers the inhibitory
phosphorylation of the CDC25 phosphatases, which
results in delayed mitotic entry, ensuring appropriate DNA
repair at the G2/M checkpoint [13].
Accordingly it has been recently demonstrated
that tumours bearing high levels of oncogene-induced
replicative stress, such as MYC driven aggressive
lymphoma mouse models and neuroblastoma, are sensitive
to single agent CHK inhibitors [16–18].
On the other hand recent studies show that a subset
of DLBCLs display mutations of genes involved in DNA
repair [19]. Although the functional consequences of
specific mutations have not been elucidated yet, these
data further highlight the role of the DDR pathway
in DLBCL pathogenesis. Therefore, inhibition of the
DNA damage repair pathway may represent a valid
therapeutic approach to fight cancers with aberrant DDR
activation and CHK inhibitors are currently being tested
in clinical trials in combination with DNA damaging
agents (chemotherapy and radiotherapy) in a variety of
tumors [20,21]. Taken together these findings represent a
strong rationale to investigate the functional role of the
DDR pathway in DLBCL, and to ascertain whether its
components might represent potential therapeutic targets.
Here we demonstrated that 1) a substantial fraction of
DLBCLs display constitutive expression of the DNA
damage marker γH2AX, which was associated with
poor prognosis following conventional R-CHOP/CHOPlike chemoimmunotherapy, 2) that c-MYC expression,
γH2AX and DDR activation were significantly associated,
confirming the intimate relationship between oncogene–
induced genomic instability and DDR activation in
DLBCL, and 3) that DLBCL cell lines and primary cells
exhibiting constitutive activation of the DDR pathway
are very sensitive to the inhibition of checkpoint kinases.
Taken together these data suggest that pharmacologic
inhibition of DDR through targeting of CHK kinases may

represent a new promising therapeutic strategy in the
subset of DLBCLs with activated DDR pathway.

RESULTS
Constitutive activation of DDR components
and genomic instability in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas
We assessed by immunohistochemistry the
expression levels of the components of the DDR pathway
(CHK1, CHK2, CDC25c) and their phosphorylated
forms in three reactive lymphnodes, 27 cases of small
lymphocyte lymphoma (SLL), 18 marginal zone
lymphoma (MZL), 44 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 22
Burkitt lymphoma (BL), and 99 consecutive DLBCL cases
diagnosed at our Institution from 2002 to 2011.
Components of the DDR pathway CHK1, CHK2
and CDC25c resulted to be expressed in 100% of B cell
neoplasms and normal reactive follicles tested (Table 1) but
only aggressive lymphomas (BLs and DLBCLs) showed a
significant activation of DDR pathway, as demonstrated
by the expression of CHK1, phosphorylated at ser 345,
and CDC25c, phosphorylated at ser 216 (Table 1). The
phosphorylated form of the CHK2 kinase at thr 68 was
found to be expressed only in a minority of DLBCL cases
(5%) (Table 1).
We thus hypothesized that lymphomas with
constitutive activation of the DDR pathway would be
characterized by higher levels of inherent genomic
instability. In order to verify this hypothesis we investigated
the expression of the phosphorylated form of the histone
H2AX at serine 139 (γH2AX), a marker of DDR activation
and DNA double strand breaks [13–15], in our B-cell
lymphoma panel. Remarkably DLBCLs showed the highest
constitutive γH2AX expression with 47% of positive cases
(defined as percentage of positive cells ≥ 30%, in the
methods section), confirming that DLBCL is a neoplasm
characterized by high genomic instability and inherent DNA
damage (Figure 1A, 1B). Reactive follicles and indolent
B-cell lymphomas (MZL and CLL) showed low or absent
expression of activated DDR components and γH2AX, and
Hodgkin lymphoma cases showed intermediate expression
(18% of γH2AX positive cases) (Table 1, Figure 1A, 1B).
By using cluster analysis on immunohistochemical
results, considering the whole panel of DDR activation
markers, aggressive B-cell neoplasms (DLBCL and BL)
clearly clustered together, being characterized by higher
constitutive CHK1, CDC25c, and H2AX phosphorylation,
whereas indolent B-cell neoplasms and HL formed a
separate cluster (Figure 1A).
Since high inherent genomic instability favours
cancer progression and chemoresistance we next
investigated the prognostic significance of constitutive

patients. All patients were diagnosed and treated with
chemoimmunotherapy at our institution. Characteristics
of patients and univariate analyses are shown in Table S1.
The spectrum of γH2AX expression is shown in Figure 1C.
In the univariate analysis, pCDC25c ser 216 and γH2AX
overexpression were significantly associated with worse
overall survival (Table S1), as well as age≥60 years, IPI
score > 2 and bcl-2/MYC double positivity. Remarkably
5-year OS was 41% for γH2AX positive vs 70% for
γH2AX negative patients (Figure 1D). Interestingly,
the prognostic significance of γH2AX was particularly
evident in the low-intermediate risk IPI group (0–2 risk
factors), identifying a subgroup characterized by worse
outcome (55% 5-year OS) (Figure 1E). In the multivariate
framework γH2AX was found to be an independent
prognostic predictor (Table  S2). These results suggest
that constitutive γH2AX expression is an independent
negative prognostic predictor in DLBCL, being able to
identify patients with poor prognosis even within the lowintermediate risk group according to the IPI score.

significant association between γH2AX positivity, c-MYC
expression, and increased activation of CDC25c and CHK
kinases (Figure 1F) (Table 2). Interestingly non-GCB and
GCB cases, low and high risk IPI score patients were
equally distributed in the γH2AX positive and negative
groups (Table 2).
Also by categorizing patients in 2 groups depending
on the c-MYC expression status, we could confirm the
association between c-MYC, γH2AX, pCDC25c and
pCHK1/2 kinases expression: of note γH2AX positive
cases raised from 37% to 63%, pCHK1/2 positive
cases from 28% to 55%, pCDC25c positive cases from
24% to 55% from the c-MYC negative to the c-MYC
positive group (Figure 1G). These results indicate a tight
association between c-MYC expression, inherent genomic
instability, and constitutive DDR activation.

Inhibition of checkpoint kinases hinders
proliferation and promotes apoptotic death in
DLBCL cells
The observation that about half of the DLBCL cases
were characterised by constitutive γH2AX expression,
which was associated with adverse outcome and with
activation of the DDR pathway, suggests that inhibition
of the DDR may represent a promising new therapeutic
strategy to fight this subset of tumours.
Therefore, we explored the effect of DDR pathway
inhibition in a series of human B-cell NHL cell lines,
including 6 DLBCL cell lines, 1 BL and 1 HL cell line
(used respectively as a positive and negative control for
constitutive DDR activation). All the DLBCL cell lines,
irrespectively of their GC or ABC origin, and the BL cell
line RAMOS showed some activation of the DDR pathway,
as defined by constitutive phosphorylation of CHK1
at ser 345 and/or phosphorylation of CHK2 at thr 68,

c-MYC, γH2AX and DDR activation markers
are frequently co-expressed in DLBCL
Since it has been reported that MYC-driven
replicative stress leads to inherent DNA damage [11,
12, 17, 18], we evaluated the correlation between
c-MYC, γH2AX (marker of DNA damage) and
pCHK1/2 (pCHK1+pCHK2) and pCDC25c expression
(markers of DDR activation), hypothesizing that γH2AX
positive DLBCLs would be characterized by c-MYC
overexpression and enhanced DDR activation.
The 99 patients considered in the survival analysis
were divided in 2 groups based on γH2AX expression
levels. By using Fisher’s exact test we found a statistically

P value was calculated with the Fisher’s exact test
and constitutive expression of γH2AX, evaluated by
Western blot analysis.
The HL cell line KMH2 showed low or absent basal
levels of activation of the DDR pathway, which did not
translate in increased γH2AX expression (Figure 2A). In
line with the results of the immunohistochemical study, we
found a significant correlation between c-MYC levels and
pCHK1 ser 345 levels (Figure 2B). Finally, primary cells
from 2 out of 3 aggressive B-cell lymphoma patients (2
DLBCL, 1 BL) showed constitutive γH2AX expression.
We did not find γH2AX overexpression in indolent
B-cell lymphoma primary cells and normal bone marrow
mononucleated cells (Figure 2C).
To evaluate the therapeutic potential of CHK
inhibition, we incubated B-cell lymphoma cell lines with
increasing concentrations of PF-0477736 from 5 nM
to 10 μM. Cell viability was assessed by WST-1 assay
(Roche). PF-0477736 is a selective ATP competitive CHK
inhibitor with IC50 of 2 and 47 nM respectively for CHK1
and CHK2, which was demonstrated to have activity in
preclinical models of solid tumours in combination with
DNA damaging agents [22, 23]. PF-0477736 induced cell
death in a time and dose dependent manner, with a maximal
effect after 48 hours. The most sensitive cell line was
BJAB, with an IC50 of 48 nM and 9nM at 24 and 48 hours
(hrs) respectively (Figure 2D, 2E). KM-H2 cells were
resistant. All the other DLBCL cell lines were sensitive
to nanomolar concentrations of PF-0477736, with IC50s
ranging from 160 to 230 nM (Figure 2D, 2E). The resistant
KM-H2 cells did not display any constitutive expression of
γH2AX and pCHK2, and only weak pCHK1 and c-MYC
expression (Figure 2A). These results were confirmed also
by using a different inhibitor of CHK kinases, AZD-7762
[24], which also displayed submicromolar IC50 values
at 48 hours (Fig S1) in DLBCL and BL cell lines. Taken
together these observations indicate a high efficacy of
CHK inhibitors against DLBCL cell lines characterized
by constitutive activation of the DDR pathway.

Since some reports link the sensitivity to CHK
inhibition to the dysfunction of the p53 axis in different
tumor models [22, 24], we profiled our cell lines by
conventional Sanger sequencing for the presence of TP53
mutations and CDKN2A deletions, (known recurrent
genomic alterations in DLBCL which result in p53 axis
and G1/S checkpoint dysfunction). Alterations resulting
in G1/S checkpoint dysfunction were found in all the
DLBCL cell lines and in the BL cell line RAMOS and
only the resistant KM-H2 cells were TP53 wild type
with no alteration of CDKN2A (Figure 2E) (Table S3).
Notably, in line with previous reports [22, 24], cotreatment with the CHK inhibitor PF-0477736 enhanced
the efficacy of doxorubicin in the TP53 mutant DLBCL
cell lines (Figure S2A).
In order to establish the relevance of p53 status in
the cytotoxic activity of PF-0477736, we induced stable
transfection of the TP53/ wild-type KM-H2 cells with the
dominant negative mutant p53dd. Interestingly we failed
to induce sensitivity to PF-0477736 single agent or in
combination with doxorubicin after p53dd transfection
(Figure S2 B–D). These results indicate that at least in
this cellular context disruption of p53 function is not
sufficient to induce sensitivity to CHK inhibition or to
combinations with doxorubicin, and that probably other
mechanisms cooperate in determining the sensitivity to
CHK inhibition and dependence on the G2/M checkpoint
in these cells.
To further investigate the mechanisms of action
of PF-0477736 we determined the effect on apoptosis
by using Annexin V/Propidium Iodide staining. In line
with WST-1 assay results, low nanomolar concentrations
of PF-0477736 induced cell death by apoptosis after 24
hours of incubation in the sensitive BJAB cells, but not
in the resistant KM-H2 cells (Figure 3A, 3B). Consistent
with the induction of apoptosis PARP cleavage was
detected by western blot after 24 hours in BJAB cells
(Figure 3C).

CDC25c de-phosphorylation triggers its proteasome
dependent degradation, in line with recent findings [25]
we also observed a decrease in total CDC25c levels
following treatment. Moreover we observed a rapid and
marked dose dependent increase of γH2AX consistent
with accumulation of DNA damage (Figure 4 A, 4B). On
the contrary, in KM-H2 cells we did not observe increased
γH2AX levels following PF-0477736 treatment (western
blot and immunofluorescence), and consistent with the
low activation status of the DDR pathway, these cells
did not show any constitutive CDC25c phosphorylation
(Figure 4A). Taken together, these findings show that
inhibition of the CHK kinases effectively increases the
amount of DNA damage in DLBCL cells without the
presence of exogenous genotoxic sources. In line with
these results, incubation with PF-0477736 for 24 hrs

PF-0477736 inhibits CDC25c phosphorylation
and determines rapid DNA damage
accumulation in DLBCL cell lines
Following DNA damage, the activation of CHK1
and CHK2 results in the inhibitory phosphorylation of
the CDC25c phosphatase, which determines inhibition of
mitotic entry, allowing DNA repair [13]. Therefore, the
impairment of the G2/M checkpoint mediated by CHK
inhibition should determine an uncontrolled DNA damage
accumulation leading to replication fork collapse followed
by cell death.
To verify this hypothesis we first incubated the
sensitive BJAB cells and the resistant KM-H2 cells with
increasing concentrations of PF-0477736 and assessed

Figure 4: (Continued) (D) Model of activation of the DDR pathway and G2/M checkpoint after DNA damage. After DNA damage, the
histone H2AX is promptly recruited at the DNA damage foci and phosphorylated. The ATR and ATM kinases phosphorylate CHK1 and
CHK2 which in turn phosphorylate the downstream target CDC25c phosphatase. This inhibitory phosphorylation results in cell cycle
arrest, allowing DNA repair. The CHK2 kinase participates also in the G1/S checkpoint, by stabilizing p53 after DNA damage. (E) The
GCB-derived SUDHL-4 cells and the ABC-derived U-2932 and TMD8 cells were incubated with PF-0477736 250 nM for 24 hours. BJAB
cells were used as a control. Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 5A and 5B, an induction of γH2AX and pCHK1 ser 345 was observed
in all DLBCL cell lines. At the same time point, PARP cleavage consistent with apoptosis induction was detected in all DLBCL cell lines.

triggered a futile feedback loop resulting in increased
phosphorylation of ATM, and both its targets CHK1
and CHK2, as previously reported with different CHK
inhibitors [26] (Figure 4C). The position and function
of different components of the DDR pathway is briefly
elucidated in Figure 4D.
A similar mechanism resulting in DNA damage
accumulation and hyper-phosphorylation of CHK1, was

of γH2AX and pCHK1, as already demonstrated in
DLBCL cell lines (Figure 5B). Characteristics of
patients whose cells were used for ex-vivo experiments
are shown in Figure 5C.
PF-0477736 displayed activity both in TP53 wild
type and mutant primary cells, although the highest
activity was observed in a TP53 mutant Burkitt lymphoma
sample (BL#2) (Figure 5B) (Table S3).
These data strongly suggest that PF-0477736
may exert a selective cytotoxic activity on aggressive
lymphoma cells, without inducing specific changes in
normal bone marrow mononucleated cells, at least in short
term culture.

PF-0477736 shows high single agent activity and
promotes DNA damage in primary aggressive
B-cell lymphoma cells

DISCUSSION

To investigate the activity of PF-0477736 in primary
lymphoma cells and to evaluate its toxicity on bone
marrow mononucleated cells we incubated a panel of
primary cells from aggressive B-cell lymphoma patients
(n = 5) [2 BL, 2 DLBCL, 1 mantle cell lymphoma blastoid
variant (MCL)], indolent B-cell lymphoma patients (n = 5)
(3 CLL, 1 MZL, 1 hairy cell leukemia) and normal bone
marrow progenitors (n = 7), with PF-0477736 at the fixed
dose of 500 nM for 24 hours.
Consistently with our previous findings,
aggressive B-cell lymphoma primary cells were
sensitive to PF-0477736, whereas primary indolent
B-cell lymphoma cells were only slightly sensitive and
normal bone marrow progenitors were resistant (Figure
5A). Of note, in DLBCL primary cells PF-0477736
induced DNA damage accumulation with increase

In this study we addressed the value of targeting
the DDR pathway in aggressive B-cell lymphomas,
focusing the attention on DLBCL. First we demonstrated
that DLBCL is a neoplasm characterized by high
inherent genomic instability and that the DDR pathway
is aberrantly active in DLBCL cell lines, primary cells,
and DLBCL tissue samples. In our patient cohort about
half of all patients showed high levels of the DNA damage
marker γH2AX and activation of the DDR components at
the moment of initial diagnosis. We observed a significant
correlation between γH2AX expression levels, constitutive
DDR activation and c-MYC overexpression, suggesting
an intimate relationship between MYC-induced oncogenic
stress, genomic instability and DDR activation in DLBCL

negative TP53-wild type KM-H2 cells was unaffected
by transfection with the dominant negative p53 mutant
p53DD, suggesting that the p53 status is not a primary
determinant of sensitivity to DDR inhibition, and that the
presence constitutive DDR activation likely plays a major
role. On the other hand it is noteworthy that single agent
PF-0477736 showed activity in TP53 mutant aggressive
B-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary cells, and that
combined treatment with PF-0477736 was able to revert
resistance to doxorubicin in TP53 mutant cells (Figure S2).
These observations suggest that inhibition of checkpoint
kinases could be an effective treatment strategy for TP53
mutant chemoresistant lymphomas with aberrantly active
DDR pathway. These data are in line with previously
published work showing single agent activity of CHK
inhibitors in MYC driven lymphoma mouse models which
recapitulate human Burkitt lymphoma [16], suggesting
that Burkitt lymphoma and DLBCL share dysregulation
of the DDR as a common pathogenetic feature. The role
of DDR pathway and its upstream components [such as
DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and ATM] as
therapeutic targets in MYC driven lymphomas has been
confirmed in a recent report by Johnstone and coworkers
on the efficacy of combined inhibition of ATM, DNA-PK
and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in Eμ-MYC
lymphoma models [27]. Intriguingly previous work from
Blagosklonny and coworkers showed that enhanced DDR
signaling was associated with mTOR over-activation
during senescence coupled with hyper-mitogenic drive,
and that inhibition of mTOR signaling by rapamycin
attenuated DDR activation related to senescence [28, 29];
since oncogene-induced replicative stress may lead to

(Fig. 1E). Moreover, patients showing high γH2AX
expression had a statistically significant lower 5-year OS
compared to patients with low levels of γH2AX following
conventional chemoimmunotherapy (Fig. 1C, 1D). These
findings indicate that constitutive DDR activation could
determine resistance to therapy with DNA damaging
agents and that the DDR could be an important therapeutic
target in DLBCL.
We demonstrated in in vitro and ex-vivo models
that targeting the DDR pathway by inhibition of CHK
kinases could be an effective treatment strategy in the
subset of DLBCL with constitutive activation of DDR.
Treatment with the CHK1/2 inhibitor PF-0477736 as
single agent induced cell death by apoptosis at nanomolar
concentrations in DDR positive DLBCL cell lines and
markedly inhibited cell viability in primary DLBCL
and BL cells. The antiproliferative affects observed
with PF-0477736 in DLBCL cells were recapitulated by
using a different inhibitor of CHK kinases (AZD7762),
indicating a specific class effect of these compounds in
DLBCL. Inhibition of CHK kinases effectively resulted in
inhibition of the phosphorylation of the downstream target
CDC25c, and increased the phosphorylation of the DNA
damage marker γH2AX both in DLBCL cell lines and
primary cells. Interestingly the increased amount of DNA
damage determined by CHK inhibition triggered a futile
feed-back loop characterized by enhanced ATM activation
and hyperphosphorylation of CHK1 and CHK2, which
could be used as a biomarker of activity in future clinical
trials. Notably we did not observe any in vitro cytotoxicity
in normal bone marrow progenitors. Our results also
indicate that the sensitivity to CHK inhibition of the DDR

Similarly to what we observed in cell lines, treatment with PF-0477736 determined DNA damage accumulation with increased γH2AX
and pCHK1 ser 345 levels in DLBCL primary cells, whereas no changes were observed in primary B-CLL cells and normal bone

cellular senescence and DDR activation [30], and given
that active mTOR signaling and c-MYC expression
have been demonstrated to be significantly associated in
DLBCL [31], it is tempting to think that mTOR and MYC
may cooperate in inducing aberrant DDR activation, and
that dual targeting of DDR and mTOR could be a valuable
strategy in DLBCL.
Moreover it has been recently reported that inherent
DNA damage is a common trait shared by a variety of
haematological cancer cell lines of both myeloid and
lymphoid origin [32]. These findings, together with our
observations, suggest that genomic instability, inherent

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DNA damage and alterations in DNA repair pathways may
represent an Achilles heel by which highly genetically
unstable aggressive lymphoid neoplasms may be targeted
therapeutically.
Collectively, our observations depict a model of
synthetic lethality in which cells with high oncogene
induced genomic instability carry higher levels of
constitutive DDR activation in order to cope with
oncogene-induced replicative stress, and are thus sensitive
to CHK inhibition, according to the oncogene-induced
DNA damage model for cancer development proposed by
Halazonetis and coworkers [11] (Figure 6). In conclusion,

Figure 6: Proposed model of oncogene induced genomic instability in DLBCL. Constitutive expression of oncogenes such as
MYC increases replicative stress and determines G1/S checkpoint activation, which in normal cells leads to apoptotic cell death. Aggressive
B-cell lymphoma cells tolerate increased amounts of genomic instability by constitutive activation of the G2/M checkpoint/DDR pathway
(ATM-ATR-CHK1-CHK2-CDC25c axis). Inhibition of the DDR pathway by CHK inhibitors (CHKi) acts as a synthetic lethal mechanism,
leading to “uncontrolled” genomic instability and cell death.

our data demonstrate that inherent genomic instability and
DDR pathway constitutive activation are frequent features
in DLBCL, and are associated with a poor prognosis. The
high efficacy of CHK inhibitors in DLBCL cell lines and
primary cells characterised by aberrantly active DDR
pathway, strongly suggest that the constitutive activation
of this pathway may represent a novel therapeutic target,
providing a rationale for further clinical evaluation of this
therapeutic strategy in DLBCL.

and P53 proteins; the antibody reactivity and sources
as well as the antigen retrieval protocols, dilutions and
revelation systems are detailed in supplementary Table
S4. The cutoff for positivity was set at 30% of cells
expressing the protein of interest, unless otherwise
specified [34]. For Bcl-2 and c-MYC we applied a cutoff of 70% and 40%, whereas for p53 staining a cut-off
of 50% was applied, according to the recent literature [9,
35]. Immunohistochemical preparations were visualized
and images were captured using Olympus Dot-slide
microscope digital system equipped with the VS110
image analysis software.

Survival analyses were performed using the KaplanMeier method and differences between groups calculated
by using the log-rank test [38]. Multivariate analyses
were performed by using the Cox regression model.
Procedures to determine the effects of certain conditions
on cell proliferation and apoptosis, were performed in
3 independent experiments. The 2-tailed Student t test
was used to estimate the statistical significance of the
differences between results from the 3 experiments. The
Fisher’s exact test was used to estimate differences in
proportions between groups. The Pearson and Spearman’s
tests were used to establish correlations between different
variables. Quantification of protein-band intensities by
densitometric analysis was performed using NIH ImageJ
software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).
Hierarchical clustering of immunohistochemical results,
displayed in dendrogram in Figure 1A, was generated as
reported in supplementary material. The SPSS and PRISM
softwares were used for the statistical analyses. Detailed
methods are available in supplemental data.

Cell lines and primary cells
The human DLBCL-derived cell lines SUDHL-4,
SUDHL-6, the HL cell line KM-H2 and the BL cell line
RAMOS were obtained from the German Collection
of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department
of Human and Animal Cell Cultures (Braunschweig,
Germany). The DLBCL derived cell lines (HBL-1,
U2932, TMD8, BJAB) were kindly provided by Dr. R.E.
Davis (Houston, Tx). Cell lines were cultured in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD),
1% L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin in a humid
environment of 5% CO2 at 37°C. The phenotypes and
genotypes of these cell lines have been previously
described [36, 37].
Primary cells from patients were obtained from
bone marrow samples, peripheral blood of leukemic
phase patients with more than 90% of circulating blasts,
neoplastic abdominal and pleural effusions. Normal bone
marrow progenitors were harvested from bone marrow
aspirations performed in lymphoma patients undergoing
initial staging procedures, which then resulted negative for
lymphoma infiltration.

Western blotting, immunofluorescence and flow
cytometry
Preparation of cellular protein lysates, protein
quantitation, western immunoblotting and flow cytometry
were performed as previously described [39, 40]. A total
of 30 μg of protein was denatured in Laemmli buffer at
95°C and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then
electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and
submitted to immunodetection with the relevant antibody.
Membrane-bound secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse, BioRad) were detected
using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate
(Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL).

Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine coated glass
coverslips and incubated overnight at 4°C. Samples
were incubated for 1 hour in PBS plus 1% Bovine Serum
Albumin (Sigma- Aldrich) to block unspecific binding
before incubating with the primary antibody (Cell
Signaling) diluted 1:400 in PBS 1% BSA overnight at
4°C. The samples were rinsed in PBS and then incubated
with secondary antibody Alexa fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit
IgG (Life Technologies) for 40 min at 37°C in darkness.
Mounting and nuclei counterstaining were performed
using the “pro long antifade reagent with DAPI”
(Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) and observed under a
fluorescence microscope.

In vitro proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 50,000
cell/100 μl/well with increasing concentrations of drug
(0.005–10 μM) for 24 and 48 hours. Cell viability was
assessed by adding WST-1 reagent (Roche Applied
Science, Basel, Switzerland) to the culture medium at
1:10 dilution, according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Viability of primary cells was assessed by using the trypan
blue staining, in triplicate experiments.
