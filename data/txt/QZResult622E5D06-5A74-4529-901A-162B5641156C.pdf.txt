ABSTRACT
Paclitaxel exhibits clinical activity against a wide variety of solid tumors. However,
resistance to paclitaxel significantly attenuates the response to chemotherapy.
The ABC transporter subfamily C member 10 (ABCC10), also known as multi-drug
resistance protein 7 (MRP7) efflux transporter, is a major mediator of paclitaxel
resistance. Here, we determine the effect of NVP-BHG712, a specific EphB4 receptor
inhibitor, on 1) paclitaxel resistance in HEK293 cells transfected with ABCC10, 2) the
growth of tumors in athymic nude mice that received NVP-BHG712 and paclitaxel
systemically and 3) the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in presence or absence of
NVP-BHG712. NVP-BHG712 (0.5 μM), in HEK293/ABCC10 cells, significantly enhanced
the intracellular accumulation of paclitaxel by inhibiting the efflux activity of ABCC10
without altering the expression level of the ABCC10 protein. Furthermore, NVPBHG712 (25 mg/kg, p.o., q3d x 6), in combination with paclitaxel (15 mg/kg, i.p.,
q3d x 6), significantly inhibited the growth of ABCC10-expressing tumors in athymic
nude mice. NVP-BHG712 administration significantly increased the levels of paclitaxel
in the tumors but not in plasma compared to paclitaxel alone. The combination of
NVP-BHG712 and paclitaxel could serve as a novel and useful therapeutic strategy to
attenuate paclitaxel resistance mediated by the expression of the ABCC10 transporter.

microtubule dynamics, diminished interaction of paclitaxel
to its cellular target [7, 8] and genetic polymorphisms
[9]. These aforementioned mechanisms of resistance
typically produce chemotherapeutic failure. Recent data
indicate that paclitaxel resistance occurs via its active
efflux from cancer cells due to the expression of the ATPbinding cassette subfamily C member 10 (ABCC10),
also known as multidrug resistant protein 7 (MRP7) [1,
3]. The human ABCC10 gene is located on chromosome
6p21.1. ABCC10 is a 171-kDa protein that contains three
membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and two nucleotidebinding domains (NBDs) [1, 10]. ABCC10 also mediates
the cellular efflux of several other antineoplastic drugs,
including docetaxel, vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine,
cytarabine, gemcitabine, 2’,3’-dideoxycytidine, 9(2-phosphonyl methoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA), and
epothilone B, and endogenous substances such as
estradiol-17β-D-glucuronide (E217βG) and leukotriene
C4 [3]. The expression of the ABCC10 transporter is
positively correlated with paclitaxel resistance in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [1, 11, 12]. The ABCC10
transcript is expressed (in order of highest to lowest) in
the pancreas, liver, placenta, lungs, kidneys, brain, ovaries,
lymph nodes, spleen, heart, leukocytes, and colon [13].
Another group reported that ABCC10 mRNA is highly
expressed in various tissues, including the kidneys, brain,
and colon, suggesting that it is involved in the transport of
drugs and other endogenous molecules [14].
NVP-BHG712 (4-methyl-3-(1-methyl-6-(pyridin3-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin- 4- ylamino)- N-(3(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)benzamide) is a specific EphB4
receptor (receptor cloned from erythropoietin-producing
hepatocellular carcinoma) inhibitor that blocks vascular
endothelial growth factor mediated angiogenesis in vivo
[15]. Previous preclinical studies from our lab have shown
that the ABCC10 transporter efflux function is inhibited by
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as nilotinib and masitinib
[1, 16-18]. For the first time, we report that in vitro,
NVP-BHG712 significantly inhibits the efflux activity
of the ABCC10 in HEK293 cells overexpressing the
ABCC10 transporter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
NVP-BHG712 enhanced paclitaxel-mediated inhibition
of the growth of ABCC10-expressing tumor in a tumor
xenograft mouse model in vivo and report the tumor and

growth of the cell lines used in our study. Based on the
cytotoxicity assay, we chose to use NVP-BHG712 (Fig.
1A and B) at concentrations of 0.25 µM and 0.5 µM
because at these concentrations, at least 80-90% of the
cells survived. NVP-BHG712, at 0.25 µM and 0.5 µM,
significantly decreased the resistance to paclitaxel in the
HEK293/ABCC10 cell line as compared to the control
HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells (Table 1). Cepharanthine (2.5
µM), which has been shown to inhibit ABCC10 function,
significantly decreased the resistance of HEK293/ABCC10
to paclitaxel as compared to the parental HEK293/
pcDNA3.1 cells [19]. The incubation of cells with 0.5
µM of NVP-BHG712 or 2.5 µM cepharanthine did not
significantly alter the IC50 values of cisplatin, which is
not a substrate for ABCC10 in HEK293/pcDNA3.1 and
HEK293/ABCC10 cells (Table 1) [20]. NVP-BHG712
also significantly increased the response of HEK293/
ABCC10 cells to docetaxel and vinblastine, which are
substrates of ABCC10 (Supplemental Table 1). In order
to determine the effect of NVP-BHG712 on the ABCB1,
ABCC1 and ABCG2 transporters, we used the HEK293/
ABCB1, HEK293/ABCC1, and ABCG2-482-R2, ABCG2482-G2 and ABCG2-482-T7 cells, which express the
ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 transporters, respectively.
We used paclitaxel, vinblastine and colchicine as

NVP-BHG712 significantly potentiates the
anticancer activity of paclitaxel in an ABCC10expressing tumor-xenograft model

In a separate study, we measured the plasma and
tumor concentrations of paclitaxel in animals pretreated
with vehicle or NVP-BHG712 (25 mg/kg, p.o.) prior
to the administration of paclitaxel (15 mg/kg, i.v.). The
pharmacokinetic data showed that co-administration of
NVP-BHG712 and paclitaxel significantly increased
the intratumoral concentration of paclitaxel (434.58 ±
124.49 ng/ml) as compared to paclitaxel administration
alone (160.13 ± 41.12 ng/ml, p < 0.01) after 240 min
following administration (Fig. 3A). The combination
of NVP-BHG712 and paclitaxel did not affect plasma
levels of paclitaxel (Fig. 3B) after 240 min following
administration. These data suggest that NVP-BHG712induced increase in the efficacy of paclitaxel in tumors
expressing the ABCC10 is due at least in part to its direct
inhibition of the transporter activity of ABCC10, thereby
increasing the intracellular accumulation of paclitaxel.

The i.p. dose of paclitaxel (15 mg/kg) used in this
study was determined after a series of pilot experiments
which indicated that it produced significant resistance
in HEK293/ABCC10 tumor-xenograft model compared
to the HEK293/pcDNA3.1 tumor-xenograft model.
NVP-BHG712, alone (25 mg/kg p.o.) or in combination
with paclitaxel, did not produce any visible toxicity
or phenotypic changes in the male athymic NCR nude
mice. The tumors expressing the ABCC10 transporter
showed significant resistance to the 15 mg/kg i.p. dose
of paclitaxel (Fig. 2A, B and C). This is in contrast to
the tumors composed of HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells,
which were almost completely eliminated by 15 mg/kg
of paclitaxel (Supplemental Fig. 1A and B). No apparent
weight loss was observed among the treatment groups
compared to animals treated with vehicle (Fig. 2D). The
intergroup comparisons of the body weights are shown in
Supplemental Fig. 2. NVP-BHG712 (25 mg/kg, p.o.), in
combination with paclitaxel (15 mg/kg, i.p.), significantly
decreased the sizes, weights and volumes of the tumors
expressing the ABCC10 transporter (HEK293/ABCC10)
over a period of 18 days, compared to animals treated with
vehicle, NVP-BHG712 alone or paclitaxel alone (p < 0.05;
Fig. 2A, B, C and D, respectively). These results suggest
that NVP-BHG712 significantly attenuates paclitaxel

Previously, we have reported that the efflux activity
of the ABCC10 transporter is significantly inhibited by
various TKIs [3]. Therefore, we compared the efficacy
of NVP-BHG712 to that of the TKIs nilotinib, erlotinib,
lapatinib and imatinib [3, 21, 22]. In HEK293/ABCC10

NVP-BHG712 significantly decreases the cellular
efflux of [3H]-paclitaxel in HEK293/ABCC10 cells

BHG712 was significantly potent as comparable to the
TKIs in potentiating the efficacy of paclitaxel (Fig. 4).
The concentration-response curves of NVP-BHG712 and
other inhibitors in combination with paclitaxel are shown
in Supplemental Fig. 3.

We further determined the amount of [3H]paclitaxel present in the cells following incubation with
NVP-BHG712. The amount of [3H]-paclitaxel present
in the intracellular lysate of HEK293/ABCC10 cells
was significantly lower compared to that of HEK293/
pcDNA3.1 cells due to active efflux of the [3H]-paclitaxel
via ABCC10. However, over a period of time (0, 30, 60,
120 min) NVP-BHG712 (1 µM) significantly reduced the
efflux of [3H]-paclitaxel in HEK293/ABCC10 cells (Fig.
5B).

NVP-BHG712 significantly increases the cellular
accumulation of [3H]-paclitaxel in HEK293/
ABCC10 cells
In order to determine the effect of NVP-BHG712 on
the function of the ABCC10 transporter, we examined the
effect of NVP-BHG712 on the intracellular accumulation
of [3H]-paclitaxel in HEK293/ABCC10 cells. NVPBHG712 produced a significant, concentration-dependent
increase in the intracellular accumulation of [3H]paclitaxel compared to cells incubated with the solvent
buffer for NVP-BHG712 (Fig. 5A). In addition, the results
obtained with NVP-BHG712 were comparable to those
obtained with the known ABCC10 transport inhibitor
cepharanthine.

band was not present in HEK293/pcDNA3.1, indicating
the absence of the ABCC10 protein (Fig. 6A). In order
to confirm NVP-BHG712’s reversal action was not due
to a decrease in the expression of the ABCC10 protein,
we incubated the cells with NVP-BHG712 (0.5 µM) for
0, 24, 48 and 72 h. NVP-BHG712 did not significantly
alter the expression levels of the ABCC10 transporter
in the HEK293/ABCC10 cells (Fig. 6A). In a separate
set of experiment, we found that the EphB4 (120-kDa)
protein (that is specific target of NVP-BHG712) was not
detected in HEK293/pcDNA3.1 or HEK293/ABCC10
cell lysates where MCF-7 cell lysate was used as positive
control for EphB4 protein expression (Fig. 6B). These
findings suggested that the reversal of paclitaxel resistance
by NVP-BHG712 did not result from its alteration in
ABCC10 or EphB4 protein expression.

substrates, such as docetaxel and vinblastine. In addition,
NVP-BHG712 did not significantly increase the toxic
effect of cisplatin, a drug that is not a substrate for the
ABCC10 transporter, further supporting the specificity
of NVP-BHG712. To our knowledge, this is the first
study demonstrating that NVP-BHG712 potentiates the
cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel in cells expressing ABCC10
transporter. Apart from ABCC10, NVP-BHG712 partially
alters the IC50 values of anticancer drugs in HEK293/
ABCB1, HEK293/ABCC1, and ABCG2-482-R2, ABCG2482-T7 and ABCG2-482-G2 cell lines, respectively [23,
24], although not to the magnitude seen with ABCC10.
These results suggest that NVP-BHG712 strongly
potentiates ABCC10-mediated paclitaxel resistance and
moderately potentiates ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2mediated drug resistance.
Our results also indicated that NVP-BHG712 (0.5
or 1 µM) produced a significant concentration-dependent
increase in the intracellular accumulation of [3H]-paclitaxel
in HEK293 cells that expressed the ABCC10 transporter.
In addition, consistent with the aforementioned results,
NVP-BHG712 (1 µM) significantly decreased the efflux
of [3H]-paclitaxel from cells expressing the ABCC10
transporter. These findings tentatively suggest that NVPBHG712 increases the sensitivity of ABCC10-expressing
cells to paclitaxel by inhibiting its efflux from the cells.
This could be due the direct interaction of NVP-BHG712
with the ABCC10 transporter, although this remains to be
proven. NVP-BHG712 (0.5 µM) did not significantly alter
the expression of the ABCC10 protein (171-kDa protein
in the immunoblot assay in HEK293/ABCC10 cells, Fig.
6). This finding suggests that NVP-BHG712 re-sensitizes
HEK293/ABCC10 cells to paclitaxel without significantly
altering its expression.

DISCUSSION
Our preclinical study indicated that NVP-BHG712,
in combination with paclitaxel, significantly attenuated
tumor growth in athymic nude mice implanted with
HEK293 cells expressing the ABCC10 transporter in
a tumor-xenograft model (Fig. 2A, B and C). NVPBHG712 essentially restored the sensitivity of tumors
expressing ABCC10 to paclitaxel without any phenotypic
changes. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic data indicated
that NVP-BHG712 significantly increased the levels of
paclitaxel in ABCC10-expressing tumors in mice but did
not increase the plasma paclitaxel levels compared to
paclitaxel alone.
One of the major findings of this study was that
NVP-BHG712 significantly enhanced the sensitivity
of HEK293/ABCC10 cells to paclitaxel and to other

The current study did not determine the effect of
NVP-BHG712 on cancer cells. Nonetheless, several
studies suggest that the overexpression of ABCC10 in
cancer cells produces resistance to specific antineoplastic
drugs. For example, there is a significant negative
correlation between ABCC10 overexpression and
paclitaxel sensitivity in human non-small lung cancer
cells [11]. Similarly, Bessho et al. (2009) reported that
the overexpression of ABCC10 is significantly correlated
with venorebline resistance in non-small cell lung cancer
[25]. The expression of the ABCC10 produces resistance
to docetaxel in mouse salivary gland adenocarcinoma cell
lines [26]. Interestingly, mouse embryo fibroblasts that do
not express ABCC10 are highly sensitive to the in vivo
toxic effects of paclitaxel [27]. Thus, future studies should
be conducted to determine the effect of NVP-BHG712
on cancer cells that have obtained the acquired resistance
phenotype due to overexpression of the ABCC10
transporter.
Our in vivo and in vitro data indicate that NVPBHG712 surmounts paclitaxel resistance mediated
by the overexpression of the ABCC10 transporter.
Furthermore, in vitro, NVP-BHG712 significantly (but
not completely) reverses multi-drug resistance mediated
by the overexpression of the ABCB1, ABCC1 and
ABCG2 transporters. These data, provided they could
be extrapolated to humans, suggest that NVP-BHG712
may be used to overcome resistance mediated by the
overexpression of multiple ABC transporters in cancer
cells. In this study, the plasma concentration of paclitaxel
in the xenografted mice was approximately 2000 ng/ml
for 4 h after the administration of 15 mg/kg of paclitaxel.
In addition, the plasma levels of paclitaxel in our study
were not significantly altered by the administration of
25 mg/kg i.p. of NVP-BHG712. Thus, it is unlikely that
the systemic administration of NVP-BHG712 would
potentiate the toxic effects of paclitaxel. However, NVPBHG712 significantly blocks the efflux of paclitaxel from
cells overexpressing specific ABC transporters, and this
potentiates the efficacy of paclitaxel. To our knowledge,
NVP-BHG712 is the only inhibitor of the ABCC10
transporter that does not significantly alter the plasma
levels of paclitaxel in athymic nude tumor xenograft mice
overexpressing the ABCC10 transporter. Moreover, NVPBHG712 is the most potent inhibitor of ABCC10 (0.5 μM)
discovered so far that has favorable in vivo properties.
Finally, it should be noted that NVP-BHG712 is a
potent antagonist of EphB4 receptor [15]. Thus it could be
argued that NVP-BHG712 modulates paclitaxel resistance
as a result of its effect on EphB4 or proteins downstream
of EphB4 or ABCC10. However, this possibility could
be ruled out, as the cell lines used in this study did not
express EphB4 (Fig. 6B). Thus, sensitization to paclitaxel
by NVP-BHG712 is only because of its action on the
ABCC10 transporter.
Collectively, our results show that NVP-BHG712, a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has previously unknown
function in sensitizing ABCC10-expressing cells to the
ABCC10 substrate paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo. This
effect was likely due in part to a blockade of paclitaxel
efflux by ABCC10 as opposed to the alteration of the
expression of the ABCC10 protein. In addition, NVPBHG712 potentiates the anti-tumor efficacy of paclitaxel
in vivo while exhibiting excellent pharmacokinetic profile.
Thus, the combination therapy of NVP-BHG712 and
paclitaxel could represent an effective strategy to treat
patients with cancers that are resistant to paclitaxel as a
result of the expression of the ABCC10 transporter.

The parental empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid-transfected
cell line, HEK293/pcDNA3.1, and the cell line stably
transfected with pcDNA3.1 containing an expression
construct encoding ABCC10 (HEK293/ABCC10) were

1% of 100 times diluted 10,000 IU/ml penicillin-10,000
μg/ml streptomycin [28]. All in vitro experiments were
conducted at 60% to 80% cell confluency. Cells used in
the in vivo experiments were trypsinized and centrifuged at
2000 rpm for 2 min at 25°C, washed twice with PBS, and
reconstituted in DMEM at a concentration of 1×107 cells.
HEK293/pcDNA3.1 and HEK293/ABCC10 cell lines
were authenticated using short tandem repeat analysis
by the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA). The HEK293/ABCB1, HEK293/ABCC1, ABCG2482-R2. ABCG2-482-G2, ABCG2-482-T7 and MCF-7
cell lines were not authenticated.

described by Chen and colleagues [1, 16, 33-35]. Briefly,
HEK293/pcDNA3.1 and HEK/ABCC10 (1.0 x 107) cells
were injected s.c. (0.2 ml) under the armpits. When the
tumors reached a mean diameter of 0.5 cm (day 0), the
mice were randomized into four groups (n = 8) and treated
with either (a) vehicle (10% N-methyl-pyrrolidinone,
90% polyethylene glycol 300) (q3d x 6), (b) paclitaxel
(15 mg/kg, i.p., q3d x 6), (c) NVP-BHG712 diluted in
10% N-methyl-pyrrolidinone, 90% polyethylene glycol
300 (25 mg/kg, p.o., q3d × 6), or (d) NVP-BHG712 (25
mg/kg, p.o., q3d × 6, given 1 h before giving paclitaxel)
+ paclitaxel (15 mg/kg, i.p., q3d × 6). Paclitaxel was
prepared by dissolving 6 mg paclitaxel in 50% dehydrated
alcohol (EMD, MA) and 50% Cremophor ELP (BASF,
NJ). The tumor sizes were measured using calipers and
body weights were recorded [32]. The body weight of
the animals was monitored every 3rd day to adjust the
drug dosage and to determine treatment-related toxicities
as well as tumor progression. The two perpendicular
diameters of tumors were recorded every 3rd day and
tumor volume was estimated, as described previously
[32, 33]. All the animals were killed by terminal bleeding
through cardiac puncture under isofluorane anesthesia, and
plasma was collected and tumor tissue was excised and
stored at -80°C [1, 36]. All mice were maintained at the
St. John’s University Animal Facility. The IACUC at St.
John’s University approved this project, and the research
was conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act
and other federal statutes. Animals were treated humanely
and cared for in accordance with guidelines set forth by
the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care and the US Public Health Service Policy on
Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all
studies were approved and supervised by the IACUC at
St. John’s University.

Cell viability assay
A modified MTT assay was performed to detect the
sensitivity of the cells to the antineoplastic drugs in vitro
[29-31]. Approximately 5000 HEK293/pcDNA3.1 and
HEK293/ABCC10 cells were placed in each well. Every
MTT assay was run in triplicate and drugs tested included
paclitaxel (0.001 to 1 μM), docetaxel (0.001 to 1 μM),
vinblastine (0.001 to 1 μM), vincristine (0.001 to 1 μM),
cisplatin (0.1 to 100 μM), NVP-BHG712 (0.25 μM and
0.5 μM), cepharanthine (2.5 μM), verapamil (2.5 μM),
and PAK-104P (5 μM). After seeding cells in 180 μl of
medium in 96-well plates and incubating for 24 h at 37°C,
20 μl of the appropriate antineoplastic drug at various
concentrations was added (20 μl of fixed concentration of
test compound for reversal agent were added 1 h prior to
adding anticancer drugs). Subsequently, the antineoplastic
drugs, in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, were
incubated at 37°C for 72 h. After 72 h, 20 μl MTT (4 mg/
ml) was added to each well. The plates were incubated
at 37°C for another 4 h. The MTT with medium was
removed from each well, and 100 μl of DMSO was added
to each well. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm
by an Opsys microplate reader (Dynex Technologies,
VA). The degree of resistance was calculated by dividing
the IC50 (calculated using Bliss method) for resistant
cells by that of the parental sensitive cells [32]. The
degree of the reversal of the resistance was calculated by
dividing the IC50 for cells with the anticancer drug in the
absence of NVP-BHG712 or other reversal compounds
by that obtained in the presence of NVP-BHG712 or
cepharanthine.

Collection of plasma and tissues
In separate experiments, mice bearing HEK293/
ABCC10 tumors were divided into two groups: 1)
vehicle pretreatment (given 1 h before paclitaxel 15 mg/
kg); 2) NVP-BHG712 pretreatment (25 mg/kg p.o.) and
paclitaxel 15 mg/kg (n = 7). After treatment, animals
were anesthetized (using isofluorane) and blood (50 μl)
was obtained using supraorbital puncture and placed in
heparinized tubes and plasma was harvested at 10, 30,
60, 120 or 240 min after paclitaxel administration in both
groups. In addition, the tumors were removed, weighed,
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until
analysis [16].

Animal preclinical efficacy trail design
Male athymic NCR (nu/nu) nude mice (NCRNU M,
homozygous, albino; 18-25 g; 4-6 week; Taconic Farms,
NY) were used for the tumor-xenograft experiments. All
animals were maintained on an alternating 12 h light/dark
cycle with ad libitum access to water and rodent chow.
The ABCC10-expressing HEK293/ABCC10 model
was designed for the first time and used as previously

Extraction of paclitaxel from plasma and tissue
homogenate samples

removed and the cells were rinsed three times with cold
PBS. The cells were lysed using 200 μl of lysis buffer
(pH 7.4; containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS) and
transferred to scintillation vials. Each sample was placed
in scintillation fluid (5 ml) and radioactivity was measured
using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument,
IL) [38-40].

A simple, one-step protein precipitation with
acetonitrile was used for sample preparation. Tumor
and lung tissues were homogenized in saline (1:2
(v/v)). Paclitaxel was extracted from plasma and tissue
homogenate samples by precipitation with acetonitrile
in 1:1 and 1:2 ratios (v/v), respectively. Samples were
vortexed for 1 min, followed by centrifugation for 10
min at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to
insert vials from which 20 µl was injected onto the HPLC
column. Samples with concentrations higher than the
calibration range limit were appropriately diluted to fit
within the working calibration curve.

[3H]-paclitaxel efflux assay
Cells were exposed to the same procedure as stated
in the drug accumulation experiment and then incubated
in fresh medium at 37°C at various times (0, 30, 60, and
120 min) in the presence or absence of the reversal agent
(NVP-BHG712 at 1 μM). After washing three times with
ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed using 200 μl lysis buffer
and transferred to scintillation vials. Each sample was
placed in scintillation fluid and radioactivity was measured
in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument, IL)
[41, 42].

Quantification of paclitaxel
The quantification of paclitaxel in plasma and
tumors was conducted using an isocratic Shimadzu
LC-20AB HPLC equipped with an Shimadzu SIL-20A
HT autosampler and LC-20AB pump connected to a
Dgu-20A3 degasser (Shimadzu, OR), according to the
method described by Gill et al. [37]. A reverse-phase,
Phenomenex Luna C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 µm;
Phenomenex, CA) with an ODS guard column (4 mm × 3
mm; Phenomenex, CA), was used. The injection volume
was 20 µl, and the mobile phase used for the separation
of paclitaxel in plasma and tissue homogenate samples
consisted of acetonitrile and water (53:47, v/v) delivered
at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. For paclitaxel detection, the
Shimadzu UV SPD-20A (Shimadzu, OR) detector set was
at 227 nm. Data acquisition and analysis was achieved
using LC Solution software version 1.22 SP1 (Shimadzu,
OR). All samples were analyzed in duplicate. Under these
chromatographic conditions, the total run time was 15 min
with a retention time of 12 min for paclitaxel. Standard
curves for paclitaxel in plasma and tissue homogenates
were prepared in the ranges of 25-5000 ng/ml. The
analytical method described in this work has been already
established and validated previously [16, 37].

Immunoblot analysis
In order to determine if NVP-BHG712 1) affects the
expression of ABCC10 and 2) blocks EphB4, cells were
incubated with NVP-BHG712 at 0.5 μM for different time
periods (0, 24, 48, and 72 h). Then, approximately 6 x 105
cells were harvested and suspended in PBS, centrifuged
at 2000 rpm for 2 min, followed by two washings with
PBS. The lysis buffer (1X PBS, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet
P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 100 mg/ml
p-aminophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1% aprotinin
was added to the suspension followed by vortexing. The
resuspended cells were kept on ice for 30 min, followed by
centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant
was separated and stored in -80°C for the experiment.
Protein concentrations in the lysates were determined by
the bicinchonic acid based protein assay. Equal amounts
of total cell lysates (40 µg protein) were resolved by SDSPAGE electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred
onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated
in a blocking solution in TBST buffer (10 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 % Tween 20) for
1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membranes
were immunoblotted overnight with primary monoclonal
antibodies against ABCC10 at 1:1000 dilution, EphB4 or
GAPDH at 1:500 or 1:1000 dilution respectively, at 4˚C
and were then incubated for 3 h at room temperature with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution).
The protein-antibody complex was detected using
chemiluminescence [41-43].

[3H]-paclitaxel accumulation assay
The HEK293/pcDNA3.1 and HEK293/ABCC10
cell lines were harvested at 80% confluency. All cell
lines were trypsinized and cell count was done using
a hemocytometer. Approximately 7 x 106 cells were
incubated at 37°C in DMEM, supplemented with 10%
FBS with and without NVP-BHG712 (0.5 or 1 μM) for
2 h. Subsequently, HEK293/pcDNA3.1 and HEK293/
ABCC10 cells were incubated with 0.01 μM [3H]paclitaxel in presence or absence of NVP-BHG712 (0.5
or 1 μM) for 2 h. Following incubation, the medium was
