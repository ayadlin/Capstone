ABSTRACT
Poor prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) involves HBV X protein (HBx)-induced tumor progression. HBx also contributes
to chemo-resistance via inducing the expressions of anti-apoptosis and multiple drug
resistance genes. However, the impact of HBx expression on the therapeutic efficacy
of various receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors remains unknown. In this study, our
data showed that HBx overexpression did not alter the cellular sensitivity of HCC cell
lines to sorafenib but unexpectedly enhanced the cell death induced by EGFR family
inhibitors, including gefitinib, erlotinib, and lapatinib due to ErbB3 up-regulation.
Mechanistically, HBx transcriptionally up-regulates ErbB3 expression in a NF-κB
dependent manner. In addition, HBx also physically interacts with ErbB2 and ErbB3
proteins and enhances the formation of ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimeric complex. The cell
viability of HBx-overexpressing cells was decreased by silencing ErbB3 expression,
further revealing the pivotal role of ErbB3 in HBx-mediated cell survival. Our data
suggest that HBx shifts the oncogenic addiction of HCC cells to ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling
pathway via inducing ErbB3 expression and thereby enhances their sensitivity to
EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitors.

cancer, contributes to HCC development in Asia and
South Africa. HBV-associated HCC is characterized by
highly chemotherapy resistance [5, 6]. HBV X protein
(HBx) is encoded in the smallest open reading frame X,
and has been well demonstrated to play a critical role in
HBV-induced HCC development. HBx also mediates
chemo-resistance in HCC by modulating a number of
cellular genes involved in NF-κB pathway, multiple-drug
resistance, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and genetic
stability [7–10]. However, the impact of HBx expression
on the therapeutic efficacy of targeted therapy against to
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) remains unknown.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma, the most malignant
type of liver cancers, is the third leading cancer–related
mortality [1]. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infections cause cirrhosis and subsequently
contribute to the tumorigenesis in most of HCC patients [2].
These risk factors inactivate p53 transcriptional functions,
induce inflammation response, and produce oxidative
stress to promote HCC development by increasing cell
proliferation, loss of growth, and genetic alternation

Recent understanding of the complex signaling
network involved in HCC proliferation, progression and
survival leads to the development of sorafenib to this
disease [11, 12]. Sorafenib targets several key signal
transduction pathways, oncogenes, growth factors and
their receptors, including vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF)/PDGF receptor (PDGFR), and
their downstream Raf kinase. Activation or expression
of these molecules has been implicated in resistance to
apoptosis, cell proliferation, stimulation of angiogenesis,
invasiveness and metastasis of HCC [13–15] and is also
correlated with its poor prognosis [16, 17]. In addition to
inducing cell death and inhibiting angiogenesis through
targeting VEGFR and PDGFR in a Raf-dependent
manner [18], sorafenib also suppresses tumor growth by
down-regulation of Mcl-1 and enhancement of ER stress
in a Raf-independent manner [19]. However, loss of
therapeutic efficacy occurs ultimately despite the initial
responses to sorafenib [20–22]. Activation of JAK/STAT,
NF-κB, and PI3K/Akt pathway [23–25], overexpression
of HIF-1α and EGFR [26, 27], and induction of EMT
and autophagy [28, 29] have been proposed to confer the
acquired resistance to sorafenib.
In addition to VEGFR, overexpression of ErbB
family including EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 also associate
with HCC formation [30]. EGFR is activated by binding
of its specific ligands and stimulates its downstream
PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway
activation, leading to cell proliferation, cell survival,
metastasis, and angiogenesis [31, 32]. Therefore, its
overexpression is a negative prognostic factor for
HCC [33]. Targeting EGFR tyrosine kinase activity by
pharmacological inhibitors such as erlotinib and gefitinib
are approved for lung cancer. Lapatinib, an EGFR/ErbB2
dual inhibitor, is used for advanced ErbB2-positive breast
cancer cells [34–36]. However, the response rate of HCC
patients to these EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
is low, and combination of sorafenib with EGFR TKIs did
not provide additional benefit to HCC patients [37, 38].
Previous studies have shown that HBx activates
Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway by elevation of
VEGFR3 to antagonize pro-apoptosis [39]. HBx also has
been reported to increase VEGF expression through upregulation of mTOR pathway [40]. Regulations of EGFR
and ErbB2 expression by HBx in HCC cell lines were
also described in our previous reports [41, 42]. However,
it is unclear whether these regulatory effects of HBx on
VEGFR, EGFR family, and their downstream signaling
further alter the anti-cancer activity of RTK TKIs. In
this study, we addressed the impact of HBx on the
cellular sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib and EGFR
inhibitors, including gefitinib, erlotinib, and lapatinib.
Our data showed that HBx overexpression did not alter
the cellular sensitivity of HCC cell lines to sorafenib, but
unexpectedly enhanced the cell death induced by EGFR

family inhibitors through shifting the oncogenic addiction
to ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling pathway via enhancing ErbB3
expression. These findings also suggest HBx and ErbB3
as the potential biomarkers for predicting the therapeutic
efficacy of EGFR/ErbB2inhibitors in HCC patients.

RESULTS
Overexpression of HBx increases the sensitivity
of HCC cell lines to EGFR/ErbB2 TKIs
It has been reported that HBx may cause chemoresistance in HCC cells [43]. Here, we investigated
whether HBx also renders HCC cells more resistant to
RTK TKIs. First, we compared the sensitivity of Hep3B
HCC cell line and its HBx-overexpressing stable clone
(Hep3Bx) to sorafenib, the standard TKI therapy for
advanced HCC in clinic, by measuring the cell viability
in MTT assays after treatment for 3 days. However,
the inhibition of viability by sorafenib in these two
cell lines had no significant difference (Supplementary
Figure S1A), suggesting that HBx overexpression may
not affect the anti-cancer activity of sorafenib in HCC
cells. EGFR overexpression is commonly observed in
HCC [30]. By examining the protein levels of EGFR
family members in Western blot analysis, our data
indicated that the expressions of EGFR, ErbB2, and
ErbB3 were generally abundant in various HCC cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S1B). Therefore, we then tested
the impact of HBx expression on the cellular sensitivity
of HCC cells to EGFR/ErbB2 TKIs. As shown in Figure
1A, the viability of Hep3B cells was decreased by EGFR/
ErbB2 dual inhibitor lapatinib only at high concentration
(3 μM), and was not affected completely by two EGFRspecific TKIs, erlotinib and gefitinib. Unexpectedly, HBxoverexpressing Hep3Bx cell line is much more sensitive
to these drugs in comparison to its parental cell line. These
results suggested that although ErbB family is commonly
overexpressed in HCC cells, it might not be the major
driver gene for tumor survival. Nevertheless, when
HBx protein is overexpressed, the addicted pro-survival
pathways in HCC cells may be modulated and switched
to the ErbB family signaling, leading to the increase of
sensitivity to EGFR/ErbB2 TKIs. Because lapatinib
showed more obviously inhibitory effect on the viability
of Hep3Bx cells than erlotinib and gefitinib did, we focus
on lapatinib in the following experiments to address the
underlying mechanisms.
To exclude the possibility that the increased
sensitivity of HBx-overexpressing stable clone to lapatinib
is due to the clonal effect, we transiently transfected myctagged HBx into Hep3B cells followed by treatment with
lapatinib for 3 days in the clonogenic assay. The data
showed that cell number of HBx-expressing cells was less
than that of control cells in response to lapatinib treatment
(Figure 1B, upper panel). After crystal violet staining,

we can also observe higher sensitivity to lapatinib in
HBx-expressing cells than in the control cells (Figure
1B, lower panel). Similar sensitization to lapatinib by
lentivirally expressing HBx in Hep3B cells was obtained
in MTT assay (Figure 1C, upper). We also tested whether
HBx displays the same function in other HCC cell lines.
Mahlavu and HepG2 cells were transiently transfected
with HBx followed by lapatinib treatment in MTT assay.
Similarly, HBx overexpression also increased lapatinib
sensitivity in Mahlavu and HepG2 cells (Figure 1C, lower
and Supplementary Figure S1C), suggesting a common
lapatinib-sensitizing effect of HBx in HCC cells. To
further confirm the essential role of HBx in sensitizing
HCC cells to lapatinib, HBx was knocked down by siRNA
in Hep3Bx cells in clonogenic assay and the data showed
that silencing of HBx reduced the sensitization to lapatinib
in Hep3Bx cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore, Hep3B cells
transfected with HBV whole genome also showed higher
sensitivity to lapatinib in clonogenic assays, but this
effect was abolished when HBx was mutated (Figure 1E),
supporting the enhancing effect of HBx on the anticancer
activity of lapatinib in HCC cells.
We next investigated how HBx enhanced the
anticancer activity of lapatinib in HCC cells. As shown
in Figure 2A, the cell death induced by lapatinib was
higher in Hep3Bx cells than their parental cells in cell
counting assays. Consistently, the induction of sub-G1
population by lapatinib was much more in Hep3Bx cells
than in Hep3B cells (Figure 2B). Hep3Bx cells treated
with lapatinib followed by double staining with annexin
V/PI in flow cytometry analysis showed more apoptotic
population than Hep3B cells did (Figure 2C), indicating
that HBx overexpression may enhance the pro-apoptotic
effect of lapatinib. In supporting to this notion, treatment
with lapatinib for 24 hours not only suppressed Akt and
ERK activity but also induced more protein cleavage of
PARP and Caspase3 in Hep3Bx cells than in Hep3B cells
(Figure 2D). Taken together, these data showed that HBx
sensitized HCC cell lines to lapatinib-induced apoptosis.

than in their parental cells (Figure 3A). We also analyzed
the mRNA level of ErbB family in Hep3B and Hep3Bx
cells by using RT-qPCR analysis. We found that mRNA
expression of ErbB3 was dramatically higher in Hep3Bx
cells than in Hep3B cells (Figure 3B).
Both HBx and ErbB3 have been reported to
be capable of inducing Akt activation [44, 45]. The
expression of ErbB3 was directly correlated with the
degree of sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to lapatinib
[46]. Hence, we suggested that HBx might contribute to
lapatinib sensitization through up-regulation of ErbB3
and the subsequent activation of ErbB2/Akt axis. To this
end, we first transiently transfected Hep3B and HepG2
cells with HBx followed by Western blot and RT-qPCR
analyses. As shown in Figure 3C and 3D, ErbB3 protein
and mRNA expression were both induced by HBx in
Hep3B and HepG2 cells. Consistently, ErbB3 protein
level in Hep3B cells was also induced by HBV whole
genome, and this induction was abolished when HBx
was mutated (Figure 3E). Moreover, silencing of HBx
by siRNA decreased the expression of ErbB3 in both
mRNA and protein in Hep3Bx cells (Figure 3F). We then
examined the correlation between ErbB3 induction and
HBV infection in clinical HCC specimens. The mRNA
level of ErbB3 is higher in HBV-associated HCC group in
comparison to that in non-virus infection HCC (NBNC)
group (Figure 3G). ErbB3 protein expression was also
higher in HBV-associated tumor tissues than in their
adjacent normal tissues (Figure 3H). In addition, positive
correlation between HBx and ErbB3 protein expressions
in these HBV-associated tumor tissues was also obtained
(Figure 3I). Taken together, these results indicated that
ErbB3 is specifically up-regulated by HBx in HCC cells.

ErbB3 overexpression enhances the sensitization
of HCC cell lines to lapatinib
Next, we addressed whether the increased ErbB3
expression is sufficient for the sensitization of HCC cells
to lapatinib. As shown in Figure 4A, viability of Hep3B
cells expressing DsRed-ErbB3 fusion protein but not
DsRed alone were suppressed by lapatinib. In clonogenic
assays, the inhibitory effect of lapatinib on the viability of
Hep3B cell was also observed obviously after transfection
with ErbB3 (Figure 4B). Moreover, silence of ErbB3
by shRNA not only reduced the viability of Hep3Bx
cells in MTT assay (Figure 4C), but also synergized the
inhibitory effect of lapatinib in clonogenic assays (Figure
4D). However, ErbB3 shRNA did not affect the survival
of Hep3B cells (Figure 4C). These findings suggest that
HBx renders HCC cells addicted to ErbB3 signaling. In
supporting to this finding, silencing of ErbB3 reduced
Akt activity and enhanced the lapatinib-induced Caspase3
cleavage in Hep3Bx cells (Figure 4E), indicating the
dominance of the pro-survival and anti-apoptotic signaling
by HBx-induced ErbB3 in HCC cells. Indeed, lapatinibinduced sub-G1 population was further enhanced by

HBx increases the protein and mRNA
levels of ErbB3
Since lapatinib is an EGFR/ErbB2 dual inhibitor,
we next addressed whether HBx regulates ErbB family
expression to sensitize HCC cells to lapatinib. By
comparing the ErbB family protein expression and
phosphorylation in HBx-overexpressing Hep3Bx and
HepG2x and that in their parental cells, our data indicated
that HBx decreased EGFR total protein expression but
slightly increased phospho-EGFR Tyr992 phosphorylation
in Hep3Bx but not in HepG2x cells. In contrast to the
inconsistent effect on EGFR phosphorylation, HBx
can increase ErbB2 and ErbB3 protein expressions as
well as their tyrosine phosphorylation in both Hep3Bx
and HepG2x cells. The ErbB2/ErbB3 downstream Akt
signaling is also higher in Hep3Bx and HepG2x cells

association with other ErbB family members [47–49].
Since ErbB3 expression is up-regulated in accompany
with the kinase activation of ErbB2 but not EGFR and
ErbB4 in response to HBx overexpression (Figure 3A),
hence we further investigated whether HBx promotes
the up-regulated ErbB3 to form a activated complex
with ErbB2. First, we examined the correlation between
ErbB2 and ErbB3 in various HCC cell lines, and positive
correlation between ErbB3 and ErbB2 protein levels was
found (Figure 5A). Ectopic expression of ErbB3 in Hep3B

cell also increased the protein and tyrosine kinase activity
of ErbB2 (Figure 5B). On the contrary, silencing ErbB3
by shRNA reduced ErbB2 protein and tyrosine kinase
activity expression (Figure 5C). In addition, silence of
ErbB3 by shRNA specifically targeting its 3′UTR also
decreased ectopic expression of ErbB2, indicating that
ErbB3 affects the stability of ErbB2 at post-transcriptional
level (Figure 5D).
ErbB3 prefers to form heteromeric protein complex
with ErbB2 [48]. Here, we further investigate whether
overexpression of HBx enhanced the interaction between
ErbB2 and ErbB3 in IP/WB analysis, and the results
showed that the co-immunoprecipitated ErbB3 in the antiErbB2 immunocomplex was more abundant in Hep3Bx
cells than in Hep3B cells (Figure 5E). Furthermore,
overexpression of HBx can increase the interaction
between ectopically expressed ErbB2 and ErbB3
protein in the reciprocal IP/WB analysis (Figure 5F). In
proximity ligation assay (PLA), the ErbB2/ErbB3 protein
interaction (red spot) was not only located on the plasma
membrane but also was more abundant in Hep3Bx cells
than in Hep3B cells (Figure 5G). In contrast, silence of
HBx by siRNA significantly decreased the interaction
between these two receptors in Hep3Bx cells (Figure
5H). We further examined whether HBx physically
interacts with ErbB2 and ErbB3 by co-transfection of
HBx with ErbB2 or ErbB3 into HEK293T cell, and
found that HBx can be detected in the anti-ErbB2 and
anti-ErbB3 immunoprecipitates (Figure 5I and 5J). These
results indicated that HBx protein enhances the ErbB2/
ErbB3 complex formation by physically protein-protein
interaction with both of them.

not shown). In addition to activating NF-κB through
phosphorylation of IκB in the cytoplasm [59], IKKα has
been reported to function as a epigenetic regulator for NFκB-dependent gene transcription in the nucleus in response
to HBx overexpression [42, 60]. Our result showed that
overexpression of IKKα can induce ErbB3 expression at
both mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 6E). In contrast, silencing of p65 by shRNA
reduced both ErbB3 mRNA and protein expressions
(Figure 6F). Moreover, silence of IKKα also suppressed
ErbB3 protein level in Hep3Bx cells (Figure 6G). It has
been reported that IKKβ, another subunit of IKK complex,
activates p65 activity through phosphorylation of IκBα.
Here we also determined whether IKKβ also involved in
ErbB3 up-regulation. Silence of IKKβ by using shRNA
obviously suppressed ErbB3 expression (Supplementary
Figure S2B). On the contrary, overexpression of IKKβ
increased ErbB3 expression (Supplementary Figure S2C).
These data suggest that IKK/NF-κB is involved in HBxmediated ErbB3 expression.
By using JASPAR database, there are three
predicted p65-binding sites (κB1: –1242 to –1229; κB2
–1117 to –1103; κB3 –1013 to –1004) on ErbB3 promoter.
Our results found that mutation of κB2 or κB3 but not
κB1 significantly decreased ErbB3 promoter activity
(Figure 7A). Overexpression of p65 but not Sp1 enhanced
ErbB3 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in
HEK293T cells (Figure 7B). In contrast, silence of p65 by
two different clones of shRNA decreased ErbB3 promoter
activity in Hep3Bx cells (Figure 7C). Furthermore,
treatment with PDTC and BAY-11–7802 to respectively
inhibit NF-κB and IKKα activation in Hep3Bx cells
also suppressed ErbB3 promoter activity (Figure 7D and
7E). To further demonstrate that ErbB3 expression was
transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB in vivo, the binding
activity of p65 on ErbB3 promoter was determined in
ChIP assays, and the results showed that the association
of p65 to the ErbB3 promoter was obviously higher in
HBx-overexpressing Hep3Bx cells than in Hep3B cells
(Figure 7F). These data suggest that NF-κB directly binds
to ErbB3 promoter and regulates ErbB3 expression in
response to HBx expression.

HBx induced ErbB3 expression through
enhancing ErbB3 promoter activity
Next, we investigated whether HBx transcriptionally
up-regulates ErbB3 expression through enhancing its
promoter activity. HEK293T cells were co-transfected
with HBx and the luciferase construct containing the
essential regulatory region of ErbB3 promoter [50]. As
shown in Figure 6A, the ErbB3 promoter activity was
increased in HBx-expressing cells in a dose-dependent
manner, indicating that HBx transcriptionally increased
ErbB3 gene expression. HBx has been reported to activate
various transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-κB, and
CREB [51–53]. By using JASPAR database, the putative
transcription factors binding to ErbB3 promoter were
predicted (Figure 6B), and among them Sp-1, NF-κB,
AP1, E2F1, and HNF4α have been reported to be activated
in response to HBx expression [54–58]. After screening
with the inhibitors of these transcription factors, ErbB3
expression was dramatically decreased by pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and mithramycin A, specific
inhibitors against NF-κB and Sp1 respectively (Figure
6C). Overexpression of p65 but not Sp-1 enhanced both
ErbB3 mRNA and protein levels (Figure 6D and data

DISCUSSION
EGFR inhibitors such as erlotinib, lapatinib, and
cetuximab alone or in combination with sorafenib have
been tested for HCC treatment [61], but did not provide
additional benefit to these patients [62]. EGFR mutation
or ErbB2 overexpression has been viewed as critical
biomarkers for treatment of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC and
breast cancer patients [34]. However, such mutations
were not found in HBx-expressing HCC cells, and also
were not associated with the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR
TKIs in HCC patients [63, 64]. Our data unexpectedly
found that HBx can sensitize HCC cell lines to EGFR/
ErbB2 TKIs, including lapatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib,

and suggest ErbB3 overexpression as a potential
biomarker to predict the therapeutic efficacy of lapatinib
in HCC patients.
Our data showed that HBx-expressing HCC cells
were oncogenically addicted to ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling
pathway as evidenced by the findings that silence of
ErbB3 and treatment with lapatinib synergistically induced
cell death in HBx-expressing cells. Like ErbB3 induction
by HBx, ectopic overexpression of ErbB3 also increased
the oncogenic addiction of HCC cells to this RTK, and
thereby sensitizes HCC cells to lapatinib. Mechanistically,
HBx increased ErbB3 protein expression and mRNA
level through enhancing its promoter activity, and also
augmented the formation of ErbB2/ErbB3 complex
through protein-protein interactions with these receptors.
In this study, we identified NF-κB as the key
transcription factor for ErbB3 promoter activation.
Although our data also showed that mithramycin
A inhibited both Sp1 and ErbB3 protein expression
(Figure 6C), ErbB3 promoter activity was not increased
by overexpression of Sp1 (Figure 7B). Moreover,
mithramycin A has been reported to suppress Sp1 activity
as well as TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation [65]. Our
data also showed that mithramycin A reduced p65 activity
in Hep3Bx cells (Supplementary Figure S2A). These
observations suggest that NF-κB, but not Sp1, plays a
critical role in mediating HBx-induced ErbB3 expression.
In addition to inducing ErbB3 gene transcription, HBx
also increased the protein expression of DsRed-ErbB3
(Supplementary Figure S3A). Moreover, silencing of HBx
in Hep3Bx cells decreased ErbB3 protein stability in the
presence of cycloheximide (Supplementary Figure S3B),
suggesting the existence of post-translational modification.
Our data further demonstrate that HBx can physically bind
to both ErbB3 and ErbB2 to enhance the ErbB3/ErbB2
interaction (Figure 5I and 5J). These results revealed that
HBx dually up-regulates ErbB3 at both transcriptional and
posttranslational levels, and explain why the augmenting
effect of HBx on ErbB3 promoter activity is not parallel to
that on ErbB3 protein expression.
Although HBx-expressing cells are more sensitive to
lapatinib, our data also showed that erlotinib and gefitinib
did not completely suppress the viability of cells even at high
dose. In contrast to the up-regulation of ErbB2 and ErbB3,
our data showed that EGFR expression level is decreased
by HBx (Figure 3A) probably due to the suppression by
HBx-induced miR-7 [42], suggesting possible reason for the
incompletely suppressive effect of erlotinib and gefitinib on
viability of HBx-expressing cells at high dose.
Several potential reasons could explain why the
therapeutic benefits of EGFR/ErbB2 TKIs on HCC
patients were not observed in clinical trials. Recruitment
of non-HBV-associated HCC patients in the clinical trials
would be the first possible reason for the inefficacy of
EGFR TKIs [62]. Another plausible reason is that the HBV
DNA level or HBsAg expression, which is practically
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

measured in clinic, may not be actually associated with
the HBx expression in HCC tissues. Expression of HBx is
cyclic but not steady when HBV is replicated in HCC cells
[66]. It has also been found that 32% of HBV-associated
HCC patients express HBx with C-terminal deletion [67],
which reduces the transactivation activity of HBx [68,
69]. Therefore, the dynamic or truncated expression of
HBx in HCC tissues of HBV-positive patients may not
be able to induce ErbB3 expression and sensitize HCC
cells to lapatinib. These findings indicate the limitation of
HBx as the biomarker to predict the therapeutic efficacy
of lapatinib in HCC patients. Although our data showed
clinical correlation between HBx and ErbB3 expressions,
this finding should be further validated due to the limited
number of human HCC samples used in this study.
In summary, our study indicated that HBx increases
ErbB3 expression through IKKα/NF-κB signaling
pathway and enhances the formation ErbB2/ErbB3
complex by physically protein-protein interaction. This
effect thereby shifts the oncogenic addiction of HCC cells
to ErbB2/ErbB3 and sensitizes them to lapatinib (Figure
7E). Furthermore, HBx and ErbB3 overexpression could
serve as potential biomarkers for predicting therapeutic
efficacy of EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitors in HCC patients.
