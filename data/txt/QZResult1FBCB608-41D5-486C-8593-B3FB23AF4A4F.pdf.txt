ABSTRACT
The FIP1-like-1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRα)
fusion oncogene is the driver factor in a subset of patients with hypereosinophilic
syndrome (HES)/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL). Most FIP1L1-PDGFRα-positive
patients respond well to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib. Resistance to
imatinib in HES/CEL has been described mainly due to the T674I mutation in FIP1L1PDGFRα, which is homologous to the imatinib-resistant T315I mutation in BCR-ABL.
Development of novel TKIs is imperative to overcome resistance to imatinib. We
synthesized S116836, a novel TKI. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor activity
of S116836 in FIP1L1-PDGFRα-expressing cells. The results showed that S116836
potently inhibited PDGFRα and its downstream signaling molecules such as STAT3,
AKT, and Erk1/2. S116836 effectively inhibited the growth of the WT and T674I
FIP1L1-PDGFRα-expressing neoplastic cells in vitro and in nude mouse xenografts.
Moreover, S116836 induced intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as well as the death
receptor pathway, coincided with up-regulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein
Bim-EL through the Erk1/2 pathway. In conclusion, S116836 is active against WT
and T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα-expressing cells, and may be a prospective agent for the
treatment of HES/CEL.

INTRODUCTION

After excluding secondary causes of hypereosinophilia,
idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is
diagnosed. The incidence of HES (including chronic
eosinophilic leukemia, CEL) was approximately 0.036
per 100, 000 [4]. Recent study has revealed that the
pathogenesis of 10%-20% HES patients is due to the
gain-of-function fusion gene FIP1L1-PDGFRα formed
by interstitial chromosomal deletion on 4q12 [5]. The
malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells
by FIP1L1-PDGFRα may involve activation of nuclear
factor-κB pathway [6].
FIP1L1-PDGFRα-positive HES/CEL patients
are highly responsive to (low-dose) imatinib with rapid

The normal range of eosinophils in the peripheral
blood is 3%-5% with a corresponding absolute
eosinophil count of 350-500/mm3 [1]. When the
absolute eosinophil count is >1,500/mm3 for more
than 6 months, hypereosinophilia is diagnosed [2].
Patients with hypereosinophilia display infiltration of
eosinophils in tissues resulting in organ damage. The
clinical manifestations of hypereosinophilia may vary
from weakness, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, to rhinitis
[3]. The cause of hypereosinophilia may be primary or
secondary to other diseases such as parasite infection.

clinical activity in T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα-positive HES/
CEL patients. Clinic efficacy of other inhibitors remains
to be evaluated. Therefore, imatinib-resistance in FIP1L1PDGFRα-positive CEL patients is still a challenge.
Our group took effort to develop novel tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Small molecule GZD824 is
effective against gate-keeper mutant T315I BCR-ABL
[25]. In this study, we present S116836 (structure, Fig.1A)
which was another novel small molecule TKI that was
synthesized by rational design against T315I BCRABL [26]. We investigated the profile of tyrosine kinase
inhibition by S116836, its activity against EOL-1 and
BaF3 cells expressing wild-type FIP1L1-PDGFRα, BaF3
cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRα T674I mutant, and
its pharmacokinetics. In addition, we studied the in vivo
efficacy of S116836 in xenografts of FIP1L1-PDGFRα
T674I cells in nude mice.

and durable hematologic remissions [5,7]. In addition,
antibodies such as Mepolizumab [8] and Reslizumab [9]
against interleukin 5 (IL-5), and Benralizumab [10] against
IL-5 receptors to block eosinophil production, activation,
migration are appealing, and are undergoing clinical
trials to prevent end-organ manifestations and improve
the quality of life of HES/CEL patients. Corticosteroids,
interferon-α, hydroxyurea and other chemotherapy are
the treatment modules for the HES/CEL patients without
particular molecular targets, but the response durability
and short- and long-term side effects are complicated [2].
Development of targeted therapy of HES/CEL is still the
most promising and imperative approach.
Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI571), an inhibitor of
ABL, PDGFRα, and KIT tyrosine kinases, is successfully
applied to the treatment of BCR-ABL-positive chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) [11]. However, the
development of acquired resistance to imatinib has
emerged, most often due to point mutations in the ATP
binding sites (e.g. T674I and D842V in PDGFRα, T315I
in BCR-ABL, D816V in KIT) [12-15].
Several strategies targeting T315I BCR-ABL
including blockade of kinase-addiction by the thirdgeneration of tyrosine kinase inhibitor ponatinib [16],
down-modulation of BCR-ABL by inhibition of heat
shock protein [17,18] were documented. Additional
inhibition of the upstream or downstream molecules
of BCR-ABL might significantly enhance the effect of
targeting BCR-ABL [13,17-19]. These approaches may
be potentially applied to targeting imatinib-resistant
FIP1L1-PDGFRα. Several compounds have been reported
to overcome the T674I mutant, such as nilotinib [20],
EXEL-0862 [21], PKC412 (midostaurin) [22], sorafenib
[15], ponatinib [23], and DCC-2036 [24] in vitro. Despite
so, nilotinib, midostaurin and sorafenib showed limited

Kinase activity inhibition profiling of compound
S116836
S116836 was first evaluated the kinase activity
inhibition profiling. We discovered that S116836 at 100
nM potently inhibited PDGFRα tyrosine kinase activity
(Table 1). In addition, S116836 showed tremendously
inhibitory effect on the SRC family kinases SRC, LYN,
HCK, LCK and BLK, and receptor tyrosine kinase such
as FLT3, TIE2, KIT, PDGFRβ (Table 1 and Fig. 1B).
Notably, S116836 not only inhibited the wild-type ABL
tyrosine kinase activity, but also potently restrained the
imatinib-resistant gate-keeper mutant T315I ABL tyrosine
kinase activity. Taken together, S116836 is a small
molecule inhibitor inhibiting multiple tyrosine kinases.

S116836 inhibits the signaling of PDGFRα
We next determined whether S116836 is capable
of inhibiting FIP1L1-PDGFRα in intact cells. Toward
this end, EOL-1, BaF3-WT and BaF3-T674I cells were
exposed to increasing concentrations of S116836 for
24 h, the phosphorylation of FIP1L1-PDGFRα and its
downstream targets were detected. The Western blotting
analysis revealed that S116836 inhibited the levels of
phosphorylated WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα in a doseand time-dependent manner without significantly altering
the levels of total PDGFRα (Fig. 1C and 1D).
The strikingly inhibitory effect of S116836 on
FIP1L1-PDGFRα phosphorylation prompted us to
examine the impact of S116836 on the phosphorylation
status of downstream molecules of PDGFRα. The

results demonstrated that the levels of phosphorylated
STAT3, AKT, Erk1/2 were decreased after exposure to
S116836, whereas no effects on total proteins were seen.
These data were consistent with the downregulation of
phosphorylated PDGFRα (Fig. 1C and 1D).

S116836 for 72 h, and then cell viability was ascertained
by the MTS assay. S116836 was capable of inhibiting
the growth of all three cell lines with an inhibitory
concentration at IC50 of 0.2 nM, 26.9 nM, 198.8 nM,
respectively (Fig. 2A).
Because clonogenicity is a better indicator of the
ability of long-term proliferation in malignant tumor
cells, we did the test using methylcellulose in BaF3-WT
and BaF3-T674I cells. Both lines of cells were exposed
to various concentrations of S116836 for 24 h, and then
plated in methylcellulose cultures without S116836.
S116836 significantly inhibited the surviving clonogenic
BaF3-WT or BaF3-T674I cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2B).
We also investigated whether S116836 affected the
cell cycle distribution. EOL-1, BaF3-WT, BaF3-T674I
cells were treated with various concentrations of S116836
for 24 h, and then analyzed their DNA content by using
flow cytometry. The sub-G1 populations were remarkably
increased, suggesting that S116836 induced apoptosis
(Fig. 2C).

S116836 inhibits growth of imatinib-sensitive and
imatinib-resistant FIP1L1-PDGFRα-expressing
cells
We next analyzed the effect of S116836 on growth
in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant FIP1L1PDGFRα-expressing cells. EOL-1, BaF3-WT and BaF3T674I cells were treated with escalating concentrations of

and
imatinib-resistant
FIP1L1-PDGFRαexpressing cells
The proapoptotic effect of S116836 was confirmed
by ﬂow cytometry after dual staining of AnnexinV-FITC/
PI or Annexin V-PE/7-AAD. S116836 induced apoptosis
in EOL-1, BaF3-WT and BaF3-T674I cells in a timedependent manner (Fig. 3A). We next reasoned that the
expression of PARP, caspase-8, -9 and -3 might be affected
by incubation with S116836. Indeed, S116836 induced a
dose- and time-dependent specific cleavage of PARP,
caspase-8, -9 and -3, which are all hallmarks of apoptosis
(Fig. 3B).
To clarify the mechanism of apoptosis induced by
S116836, we examined the expression of other apoptosisrelated proteins with Western blotting analysis. The results
revealed no change in expression of XIAP, Survivin, Bax
but a substantial increase in Bim-EL level and a decrease
in Mcl-1 after treatment with S116836, and both proteins
changed in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C).
The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria
into the cytosol is a marker of the intrinsic pathway of
apoptosis [27]. To clarify the involvement of the apoptosis
pathway triggered by S116836, we treated EOL-1, BaF3WT and BaF3-T674I cells for different durations and then
determined cytochrome c in the cytosolic fractions by
Western blotting analysis. Cytochrome c was elevated in
the cytosol in the cells treated with S116836 (Fig. 3D).
These results indicated that S116836 induced intrinsic
(mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis.

Up-regulation of Bim-EL is a critical mediator for
S116836-induced apoptosis

Given that Bim expression was significantly increased
after S116836 treatment (Fig. 3C), we reasoned that
the induction of Bim might also be a critical mediator
for S116836-induced apoptosis in FIP1L1-PDGFRα
expressing cells. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the
impact of silencing Bim on the sensitivity of EOL-1 cells
to S116836. Transfection of siRNA duplexes against Bim
in EOL-1 provoked sufficient knockdown of Bim when

The proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim was
essential for imatinib-induced apoptosis in KIT-dependent
gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells [28] and erlotinibinduced apoptosis in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells [29].

Bim knockdown remarkably attenuated S116836-induced

the induction of Bim is a critical for S116836-induced

apoptosis in FIP1L1-PDGFRα expressing cells (Fig. 4A,
bottom). Because the Bim-extra long (EL) isoform BimEL but not Bim-long (L) and Bim-short (S) is believed the
major isoform in apoptosis [30,31], the Bim- EL isoform
was paid attention in subsequent experiments.

Up-regulation of Bim-EL by S116836
predominantly via the Erk1/2 pathway

is

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved
in the degradation of Bim. We thus hypothesized that
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway might be involved in
the turnover of Bim-EL. To this end, EOL-1 cells were
incubated with S116836 in the absence or presence of the
proteasome inhibitor MG132, and Bim-EL was assessed
by immunoblotting. Inhibition of proteasome by MG132
led to an elevation in Bim-EL in the absence of S116836,
but MG132 combined with S116836 did not further
strengthen the degree of increase in Bim-EL induced by
S116836. Therefore, the up-regulation of Bim-EL might
occur via the proteasome pathway (Fig. 4C).
Bim has multiple phosphorylation sites among
which Ser69 that Erk1/2 mediated is critical to trigger
its ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation [33,35].
The inactivation of PDGFRα and its subsequent
dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 by S116836 were assumed
to decrease levels of the phosphorylated Bim-EL at
Ser69. In deed, S116836 treatment led to a decrease in
phosphorylation of Bim-EL at Ser69 (Fig. 3C).
PI3K-AKT is another pathway to phosphorylate
Bim to regulate its expression [32-34]. Because PDGFRα

Bim is regulated at levels of transcriptional, protein
stability, and activity in various contexts [32-34]. To
explore the mechanism of S116836-mediated increase
in Bim-EL, we first detect the transcription of Bim with
qRT-PCR. However, no remarkable change in Bim was
observed in the S116836-treated cells (data not shown).
We therefore turned our attention to the posttranscriptional
regulation of Bim. We employed the chase experiment to
evaluate whether S116836 impact on the turnover rate of
Bim protein. The BaF3-WT and BaF3-T674I cells were
treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX)
to block protein synthesis, and the levels of Bim-EL were
dynamically monitored at 0, 4, 8, 12 h by immunoblotting.
The levels of Bim-EL decreased progressively over time in
the absence of S116836 (Fig. 4B). However, the presence
of S116836 slightly attenuated the decline of Bim-EL
level, suggesting that S116836 might decelerate the
turnover of Bim-EL (Fig. 4B).

Figure 4: S116836 induced upregulation of Bim-EL predominantly via the Erk1/2 pathway in FIP1L1-PDGFRαexpressing cells. A, knockdown of Bim expression led to attenuation of apoptosis. EOL-1 cells were transfected with human Bim siRNA
or nonspeciﬁc control pool (mock siRNA), followed by treatment with S116836 at the indicated concentrations for 24 h prior to subject
of Western blotting analysis (top) and cell death assay (trypan blue exclusion, bottom). Mean ± 95% CI of three independent experiments.
One-way ANOVA, post hoc intergroup comparisons, Tukey’s test. B, S116836 decelerated Bim-EL turnover. BaF3-WT and BaF3-T674I
cells were incubated in the presence of S116836 100 nM for 2 h, followed by treatment with 100 μg/ml of CHX. The cells were then
harvested at the indicated time points. Western blotting analysis was employed to monitor Bim-EL levels. C, Western blotting analysis in
EOL-1 cells incubated with 1 nM S116836 for 24 h in the presence (plus pretreatment for 2 h) or absence of 500 nM MG132. D, Bim-EL
protein levels are regulated by the Erk1/2 signaling pathway. After pre-treated with a MEK inhibitor (U0126, 10 μM) or a PI3K inhibitor
(LY294002, 10 μM) for 60 minutes, EOL-1 cells were exposed to 2 nM S116836 for 12 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting
using the indicated antibodies.

all, these data revealed the in vivo anti-tumor activity of
S116836 against T674I-FIP1L1-PDGFRα cells regardless
of its T674I mutation status.
We also analyzed the pharmacokinetics of
S116836 in SD rats. Fig. 5D is a plot of S116836
plasma concentration versus time for four SD rats,
following oral gavage administration. The corresponding
pharmacokinetic parameters of S116836 are summarized
in Table 2, which demonstrates that they all fit into a twocompartment open model. In summary, S116836 is easy to
absorb, and has a good bioavailability.

kinase inhibition by S116836 diminished activation of both
Erk and AKT pathways, we determined which pathway
was the main mediator to increase expression of Bim-EL.
We evaluated the levels of phospho-Erk1/2, phosphoAKT and Bim-EL in lysates from EOL-1 cells exposed
to S116836 in the presence or absence of U0126 (a MEK
inhibitor), LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor), or combination
of all three compounds. S116836 alone or MEK inhibitor
alone was sufficient to induce an increase in Bim-EL
levels, whereas PI3K inhibitor alone showed minimum
effect (Fig. 4D). Combinational treatment of S116836 and
LY294002 did not show additive/synergistic effects on the
induction of Bim-EL in contrast with the MEK inhibitor
treatment alone. The results indicated that the induction of
Bim-EL by S116836 may be predominantly through the
MEK-Erk1/2 pathway. Triple combination of LY294002,
S116836 and U0126 did not provoke additive/synergistic
effects on the induction of Bim-EL either (Fig. 4D), which
did not support the involvement of AKT pathway either.

DISCUSSION
Imatinib resistance is a challenge in clinic. Clinical
trials of new small molecule TKIs (e.g. nilotinib, sorafenib
and midostaurin) were not ideal against T674I PDGFRα
despite these drugs in vitro activity. For instance, one
HES/CEL patient in blast crisis harboring T674I FIP1L1PDGFRα showed a short response, followed by a rapid
emergence of pan-resistance D842V mutation in FIP1L1PDGFRα. In addition, mutations such as S601P [36],
L629P [36] were reported to be associated with primary
resistance to imatinib in FIP1L1-PDGFRα-positive
patient.
In the present study, we reported that S116836
synthesized in our lab is a novel multiple TKI, and
showing strikingly inhibitory effect on the activity
of gate-keeper mutant T315I BCR-ABL and T674I
PDGFRα at low nanomolar concentrations. S116836
potently blocked of the signaling of FIP1L1-PDGFRα
and growth in the three neoplastic cells cell lines that
expressed PDGFRα. In CML cells, S116836 inhibited the
cell viability of KBM5 harboring BCR-ABL and KBM5T315I in a dose-dependent fashion with IC50 values of
15.73-407.96 nM [26]. Similarly, S116836 potently
inhibited the cell viability of HMC-1V560G, D816V cells
(Pan J et al., unpublished data). A single 25-mg/kg oral
administration of S116836 in rats generated a maximal
plasma concentration of 6205.0±731.4 (Table 2), which
may be sufficient to kill imatinib-resistant cells harboring
gate-keeper mutant T674I PDGFRα, T315I BCR-ABL and
D816V KIT.
We have documented that S116836 induced
apoptosis via the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic
pathway as well as the death receptor pathway, with the
increased protein levels of Bim. In addition, S116836
induced an increase in sub-G1 population, which also
reflected the increase of apoptotic cells. S116836 inhibited

S116836 inhibits the growth of xenografted T674IFIP1L1-PDGFRα cells in nude mice
We further evaluated the in vivo effect of S116836
on T674I-FIP1L1-PDGFRα cells using the nude mouse
xenograft model. BaF3-T674I cells were inoculated
subcutaneously in sixteen nude mice. When the size of
tumor reached ~200 mm3 (5 days after inoculation),
mice were randomized to receive treatment with 0.5%
CMC (control) or S116836 (200mg/kg/d, oral gavage
administration) for 14 days. We found this S116836
dosage well tolerated by preliminary experiment (data not
shown). The body weights of mice were stable, with no
obvious distinctions between treated and control mice.
Motor activity and feeding behavior were all normal
(data not shown). Collectively, inspection of morbidity
and mortality didn’t reflect any significant toxicity of
S116836 at the dosage used. Based on the growth curve
(Fig. 5A), S116836 significantly inhibited the growth
of BaF3-T674I tumors. S116836-treated tumors were
remarkably lower in size and weight than control tumors
(Fig. 5B). Immunohistochemical analysis with anti-Ki67
antibody (to detect cell proliferation status) implied
that Ki67 immunoreactivity was inhibited by S116836
treatment, which meant the cell proliferation was inhibited
by S116836 (Fig. 5C, left). Immunoblotting of xenograft
tissues from mice demonstrated that S116836 potently
inhibited FIP1L1-PDGFRα and its downstream pathways,
with Bim-EL expression elevated (Fig. 5C, right). All in

the growth of xenografted T674I-FIP1L1-PDGFRα
cells in nude mice. Taken together, S116836 could be a
potential candidate for treatment of imatinib-resistant
FIP1L1-PDGFRα-dependent HES/CEL.
We have demonstrated that inhibition of
constitutively activated PDGFRα by S116836 triggered
the up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein
Bim. Furthermore, knockdown of Bim by siRNA led
to significant reduction in cell death, suggesting that
Bim plays an important role in cell death induced by
S116836 in FIP1L1-PDGFRα-positive cells. It has
been previously reported that Bim was also critical for

apoptosis following KIT inhibition by imatinib in GIST
[28], BRAF V600E inhibition by imatinib in melanoma
[37-39] and EGFR inhibition by gefitinib in non-small
cell lung cancers [29,40-42]. These observations imply
that Bim up-regulation may be a common mechanism
for oncogenic TKI-induced apoptosis. However,
knockdown of Bim didn’t completely inhibit S116836induced apoptosis in EOL-1 cells, which may result
from the residual Bim protein in the siRNA transfected
cells (Fig. 4A), or involvement of other regulators. One
of the possible candidates is anti-apoptotic protein Mcl1, which was observed to decrease in Fig. 3C. Mcl-1

was shown previously to be essential for EXEL-0862induced apoptosis in FIP1L1-PDGFRα-positive cells
[21]. In addition, Mcl-1 can interact with Bim and affect
the activity of Bim [43,44]. Bim can be regulated at the
levels of transcription and post-translational modification
[45]. In this study, we have demonstrated that Bim
induction occurred at the post-translational level after
PDGFRα inhibition (Fig. 4B). In fact, the real-time PCR
results revealed that Bim mRNA levels decreased after
S116836 treatment (data not shown), which was beyond
our expectation but further supported the conclusion
that Bim is completed regulated at the level of posttranslational modification after incubation with S116836.
The ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation is among the most
common ways in the post-translation modifications. With
the use of proteasome inhibitor MG132, we confirmed that
S116836-induced Bim up-regulation is due to the reduced
degradation through proteasome pathway. Use of specific
PI3K/AKT and MEK-Erk inhibitors on EOL-1 cells
implies that the Erk pathway predominantly influenced
Bim status downstream of PDGFRα. It has been shown
that Erk1/2 kinase could phosphorylate Bim at Ser69
(Ser65 in mouse and rat) and target it for ubiquitinproteasomal degradation [35,45]. Conversely, S116836
decreased the phosphorylated Erk1/2 and phosphorylate
Bim at Ser69, hence increased dephosphorylated and
deubiquitinated form of Bim. Last but not least, for the
important function of Bim other strategies to increase
Bim expression in FIP1L1-PDGFRα-positive cells may
be a good choice to augment the potency of S116836 or
prevent the drug resistance. The Bcl-2 antagonist ABT737
may also enhance S116836-induced cell killing.
In summary, our in vitro and in vivo results
demonstrate that S116836 has potent activity against
cells carrying wild-type or FIP1L1-PDGFRα T674I
mutation. Moreover, Erk1/2-mediated Bim up-regulation
is responsible for the pro-apoptotic effects of S116836 on
FIP1L1-PDGFRα-positive cells. Taken together, S116836
may have clinical efﬁcacy against human neoplasms
driven by FIP1L1-PDGFRα and other forms of activated
PDGFRα regardless of the mutation status.

Cell culture
The EOL-1 cell line harboring the FIP1L1PDGFRα fusion oncogene was purchased from DMSZ
(Braunschweig, Germany). BaF3 cells expressing WT
or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα were cultured as described
previously [21,23,24,46]. The presence of the FIP1L1PDGFRα fusion in all three lines of the cells was
routinely (every month) confirmed in our lab with
reverse transcription PCR [7]. The T674I mutant FIP1L1PDGFRα was verified every month by sequencing analysis
of PCR products of PDGFRα exon 15. All these cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Guangzhou,
China) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS,
Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel), 1 unit/mL penicillin, and 1
μg/mL streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2.

permission from Science and Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc. The data were visualized by creating our own high
resolution TREEspot™ interaction maps with the easy-touse compound profile visualization tool.

The colony-forming capacity of BaF3-WT and
BaF3-T674I cells was analyzed by use of methylcellulose
medium (Cat#03231, Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver,
Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
S116836 was added to the initial cultures at 100 to 1000
nM. Seven days after culture, the number of colonies
(≥50 cells were counted) was counted under an inverted
microscope [51].

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was evaluated by MTS assay
(CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation
assay; Promega, Shanghai, China) [23,46,48,49]. Cells
(2×105/mL in 100 μL) plated in 96-well plates were
treated with various concentration of S116836 for 72 h.
The absorbance/optical density was measured with a 96well plate reader at wavelength 490 nm after addition of
MTS solution.

RNA Interference
Bim-speciﬁc and mock small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) were purchased from Dharmacon RNA Tech
(Lafayette, CO). Transfection of anti-Bim or the control
siRNA duplexes into EOL-1 cells involved use of the Cell
Line Nucleofector Kit T (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) and
program O-17 according to the manufacturer’s instructions
[23,24]. Twenty-four h after siRNA transfection, the cells
were exposed to drug treatment.

Western blotting analysis
Whole lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer
[48,50]. The cytosolic fraction was prepared with digitonin
extraction buffer to detect the levels of cytochrome c in the
cytosol [23,46,48,49].

Tumor xenograft experiments

Apoptosis assay by flow cytometry

Male nu/nu BALB/c mice were bred at the animal
facility of Sun Yat-sen University. The mice were housed
in barrier facilities with a 12-h light dark cycle, with
food and water available ad libitum. BaF3-T674I cells
(1×107) resuspended in 100 μL of matrigel (BectonDickson Biosciences Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) were
inoculated subcutaneously on the ﬂanks of 4- to 6-weekold male nude mice. Tumors were measured every other
day with use of calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated
by the following formula: a2×b×0.4, where a is the
smallest diameter and b is the diameter perpendicular to a.
S116836 was dissolved in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose
(CMC) (Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China). Mice in the
control group received 0.5% CMC. The body weight,
feeding behavior and motor activity of each animal
were monitored as indicators of general health. The
animals were then euthanized, and tumor xenografts were
immediately removed, weighed, stored and ﬁxed. All
animal studies were conducted with the approval of the
Sun Yat-sen University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.

Apoptosis was measured with use of an annexinVﬂuoroisothiocyanate (for EOL-1 cells) or annexinVphycoerythrin (for BaF3 cells expressing PDGFRα)
apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Sigma-Aldrich) and analyzed with use of a
FACScalibur ﬂow cytometer and CellQuestPro software
as previously described [23,24,46,49]. Brieﬂy, cells
were cultured in the presence of S116836, harvested
and washed, and incubated in binding buffer (AnnexinV
Binding Buffer, BD Pharmingen) with AnnexinV-FTIC
or AnnexinV-PE for 15 min at room temperature. The
cells were washed and resuspended in binding buffer.
Propidium iodide (PI) or 7-amino-actinomycin (7AAD)
was added just before ﬂow cytometric analysis.

Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry
S116836-treated cells or control cells were
harvested, washed with PBS, and ﬁxed with 66% ethanol
over night at -20°C. Cells were centrifuged and washed
with PBS, then stained with propidium iodide (SigmaAldrich) and RNase in PBS solution for 1 h in the
dark. Cell cycle distribution was evaluated by use of a
FACScalibur ﬂow cytometer equipped with CellQuestPro
software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) [23,24,46,49].

China). Parameters are presented as a mean ± standard
deviation (SD).

Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed at least thrice, and
results are expressed as mean ± 95% confidence interval
(CI) unless otherwise stated. GraphPad Prism 5.0 software
(GraphPad Software) was used for statistical analysis.
Comparisons between two groups involved two-tailed
Student’s t test, and comparisons among multiple groups
involved one-way ANOVA with post hoc intergroup
comparison using Tukey test. A P value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Pharmacokinetic study
Four Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats, male and female
in half, weight 180-220 g, were fasted for 12 h before the
initiation of the study. During the study they could eat
food and drink water freely. All rats were given a dose of
25 mg/kg of S116836 in 0.5% carboxylmethylcellulose via
oral gavage. Peripheral blood samples (approximately 0.3
mL per sample) were collected from each animal via the
orbital venous plexus at 5, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,
21, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h post-dose. Blood samples
were centrifuged within 10 min of collection and plasma
was harvested. Plasma samples were stored at 4 °C until
analysis.

Plasma sample preparation and LC-MS/MS
analysis
To prepare the plasma sample for LC-MS/MS
analysis (liquid chromatography coupled with tandem
mass spectrometry), 150 µl internal standard solution
(5 µg/mL, acetonitrile) was added to 50 µl rat plasma
samples to precipitate proteins. After centrifugation for
30 min (13000 rpm, 4 °C), 20 µl of the supernatant was
introduced into the LC-MS/MS system. Detection was
carried out using a API 3000 mass spectrometer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with TurboIonSpray source
interface. The processed samples were injected on a
CAPCELL PAK C18 column (2.0 mm × 50 mm, 5 μm;
Shiseido, Japan). The system was run in isocratic mode
with mobile phase consisting of methanol and water in
the ratio of 90:10 (v/v) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min.
An electrospray ion source in the negative-ion multiple
reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used for detection.
The MRM transition channel was m/z 517.3 to m/z 233.2
for S116836 and m/z 260.0 to m/z 183.0 for internal
standard (Propranolol, Sigma). Ionization temperature
was set as 400 °C. Data acquisition and quantitation were
performed using Analyst 1.4 (Applied Biosystems, MDS
Sciex Toronto, Canada).
