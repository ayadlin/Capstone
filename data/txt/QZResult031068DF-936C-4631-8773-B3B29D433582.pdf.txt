ABSTRACT
We identified the UBE2L6 gene, encoding the ISG15-conjugating enzyme
UbcH8, as one gene significantly downregulated by promoter hypermethylation
in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Reduced expression of the UbcH8 protein
correlated with poor outcome in NPC patients. Restored expression of UBE2L6
suppressed proliferation and colony formation in NPC cells, while inducing apoptosis.
Of particular interest, we found that aberrant lipid turnover was controlled by UbcH8
in NPC through ISG15-conjugation of valosin-containing protein (VCP). Tumor tissue
and NPC cell lines showed conspicuously strong accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs)
compared to control nasopharyngeal epithelium and non-cancerous cell lines. We
demonstrated that UbcH8 counteracts degradation of adipocyte triglyceride lipase
(ATGL), a key enzyme in lipid catabolism.

implicated in NPC, including cell cycle regulation
[3], apoptosis [4], cell adhesion [5, 6], and signal
transduction [7, 8].
In the present study, we identified 479 genes, which
were epigenetically down-regulated in NPC cell lines. We
focused our interest at the UBE2L6 gene, which showed a
strong down-regulation. This gene encodes an E2 enzyme
(UbcH8) which participates in both ubiquitylation and
ISG15ylation [9–11].
Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) has been
identified to be a potential serological marker for cancer
[12]. Conjugated ISG15 has been suggested to promote
tumorigenesis, whereas free ISG15 is tumor suppressive
[13–15]. This emphasizes the importance of exploring
ISG15 modifying enzymes. Thus far, only two E2
enzymes, UbcH6 and UbcH8 have been confirmed

INTRODUCTION
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a unique head
and neck cancer with a distinctive ethnic and geographic
distribution and a complex etiology. During development
and progression of NPC, latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
infection, multiple genetic and epigenetic changes
synergistically perturb normal cellular functions, thus
contributing to NPC pathogenesis [1].
In human cancers, the coincidence of genome-wide
hypomethylation with gene-specific hypermethylation
in CpG islands of gene promoter regions has been well
documented [2]. To date, a series of putative tumor
suppressor genes (TSGs) inactivated by promoter
hypermethylation have been discovered. These tumor
suppressors are involved in many cellular pathways

to conjugate ISG15 [16–18]. Only a few UbcH8
ISG15-targets have been identified so far [19].
Interestingly, knock-down of UBE2L6 in mice
demonstrated a major impact on lipid metabolism, which
repressed the differentiation program of adipocytes
[20]. Impairment of Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)
expression and/or function, as the crucial enzyme initiating
lipid digestion, results in lipid droplets (LDs) accumulation
[21]. A functional link between UBE2L6 and ATGL has
been established although the molecular mechanism of
the link is not yet fully elucidated. Investigation of ATGL
protein turnover pointed to the ATPase valosin-containing
protein (VCP) as a necessary factor in ATGL unfolding for
the sequential degradation by proteasomes [22]. VCP has
also been shown to be a target of ISG15 in a large-scale
screen for ISG15 modified proteins [23]. Inspired by the
fact that UBE2L6 can act as an ISG15-conjugating enzyme,
and by the dysfunction of lipid turnover in UBE2L6 knockout mice [20], we postulated that UBE2L6 could control
ATGL stability through ISG15 ligation to VCP.
LDs is a dynamic organelle recently observed
to be abnormally accumulated in human tumor tissues
[24]. Accumulation of LDs in the cytoplasm is a result
of impaired metabolism in tumor cells [25]. Although
the regulation and function of LDs in non-adipocytes
is unclear, it is obvious that lipids supply fuel energy in
cancer cells. Lipid mediators derived from tumor cells
play a critical role in inducing chronic inflammation in the
tumor microenvironment [26].
We have now shown that UBE2L6 is frequently
down-regulated in NPC derived cell lines and primary
tumors by promoter hypermethylation. Reduced
expression of the UbcH8 protein correlated with poor
prognosis in NPC patients. UBE2L6 was verified as a
candidate TSG as it significantly suppressed proliferation,
colony formation and induced apoptosis in NPC cells.
This phenotype could be related to the fact that UbcH8
stabilizes ATGL through ISG15ylation of VCP, since this
modification has an inhibitory effect on VCP activity. In
summary, we show that epigenetic silencing of UbcH8
may play an interesting role in NPC carcinogenesis by
affecting lipid metabolism.

transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to validate the microarray
data on three NPC cell lines (CNE1, CNE2 and HONE1)
(Fig. 1A).
Further, we tested UBE2L6 transcription levels in
six cell lines (CNE1, CNE2, TW03, HNE1, HONE1 and
C666-1), 37 NPC primary tumor biopsies and 12 normal
nasopharyngeal epithelium by RT-PCR. All of the normal
nasopharyngeal epithelia expressed an easily detectable
level of UBE2L6 mRNA. Among the NPC cell lines,
UBE2L6 expression was undetectable in CNE2, while
the other five had weak expression of UBE2L6 (Fig. 1B).
UBE2L6 mRNA was completely silenced in 5 of the 37
primary NPC tumor biopsies. The overall expression
levels of UBE2L6 was significantly lower in the 37 NPC
tumor biopsies as compared to the 12 n
­on-malignant
nasopharyngeal epithelium (NNE) tested (p < 0.05,
Fig. 1C, 1D).

UbcH8 expression is downregulated in NPC and
correlates with patient survival
UbcH8 expression was studied in a total of 69 NPC
tumor tissues. Based on immunohisto-chemical analysis,
positive staining for UbcH8 was predominantly observed
in the cytoplasm and to a lesser degree in the nuclei of
non-cancerous stromal cells. UbcH8 expression levels in
NPC cancer nests were significantly lower than in adjacent
stromal tissue (Fig. 2A, 2B).
At the end of follow-up, 21 of 69 patients (30.4%)
died from NPC, 45 of 69 patients (65.2%) remained alive,
and 3 of 69 patients (4.4%) died from other causes or
could not be contacted. Among the 69 NPC specimens,
35 (50.7%) specimens were defined with low expression,
and 34 (49.3%) specimens with high expression. Univariate
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the complete NPC
patients (n = 69) based on UbcH8 expression indicated that
the disease-specific survival period was significantly shorter
for patients with low UbcH8 expression than for patients
with high UbcH8 expression (p = 0.011; Fig. 2C).

The UBE2L6 promoter is hypermethylated in
NPC cell lines and primary tumors, but not in
normal epithelia

RESULTS

To address the mechanism of inactivation of UBE2L6
gene in NPC, we analyzed the methylation status of the
UBE2L6 promoter in six NPC cell lines, 40 primary tumors
and 12 normal nasopharyngeal epithelium by methylation
specific PCR (MSP). Hypermethylation was found in all
these NPC cells, in 47.5% (19/40) of the primary NPC
tumor biopsies, but in none of the normal nasopharyngeal
epithelia (Fig. 3A, 3B). It should be noted that unmethylated
fragments were detected in some of the NPC cell lines and
biopsy samples. This could be due to heterogeneity among
cells and reflect the presence of stromal non-malignant cells

UBE2L6 is inactivated in NPC cell lines and

down-regulated genes, possibly inactivated by promoter
hypermthylation in two NPC cell lines CNE2 and
HONE1 (Fig. 1). Among the candidate genes identified,
the transcription of UBE2L6 showed a strong increase
(up to 7.8-fold) after 5-aza-dC and TSA treatment in
both cell lines. We performed semi-quantitative reverse

transiently transformed CNE2 cells, confirmed by Western
blot and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 4A,  4B,
Figs. 2). We detected a significant impact of UBE2L6
on antiproliferative and proapoptotic pathway related
genes. As shown in Fig.  4C, the number of colonies
formed by CNE2-UBE2L6/HONE1-UBE2L6 cells was
less than that of CNE2-empty vector/HONE1-empty
vector cells (p < 0.05). A cell proliferation assay was also
performed, showing that the CNE2-UBE2L6/HONE1UBE2L6 cells grew significantly slower compared to
CNE2 and HONE1-empty vector cells (Fig. 4D). In
addition, Ki-67 immuno-staining showed a significantly
decreased fluorescence-intensity in UBE2L6-transfected
cells compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4E),
confirming the antagonistic effect of UBE2L6 gene on cell
proliferation in CNE2 cells.
By flow cytometric analysis, a remarkable increase
of apoptosis was observed in UBE2L6 transfected cells as
compared to empty vector control. The apoptosis rate in
CNE2-UBE2L6 cells (18.06 ± 0.90%) was significantly
higher than that in the empty vector control (13.52
±  1.14%) in 3 independent tests (Fig. 5A). Caspase 3
activity assay also showed a higher apoptotic activity in
UBE2L6-transfected cells compared with empty vector
transfected cells (Fig. 5B). This data was further confirmed
by Western-blotting, which demonstrated increased
expression of the cleaved (activated) forms of Caspase 3
in UBE2L6 transfected cells (Fig. 5C).

(Fig. 6D). IFN-α treatment in combination with restoration
of UbcH8 expression in NPC cell line C666-1 resulted in
ATGL stabilization (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the exogenous
expression of UbcH8 induced ISG15-conjugated species
formation as shown by silver staining of precipitates with
ISG15 antibody in NPC cells (Fig. S5). An ISG15ylation
model system was reconstituted in CNE2 NPC cell line
by transient transfection of Myc-UBE2L6, HA-ISG15
and Myc-VCP constructs, and analyzed by reciprocal
immunoprecipitations. UBE2L6 induced a strong
formation of VCP-ISG15 complexes, as HA-ISG15 was
detected in Myc-VCP (Fig. 6E) and ISG15-conjugated
VCP in HA-ISG15 precipitates (Fig. 6F).

NPC tissues contain more lipids than NNE
Here we demonstrated that LDs are accumulated
in vivo, that NPC tumor sections were positive for LDs, as
evidenced by Bodipy staining (Fig. 7).

DISCUSSION
UbcH8 was originally discovered as a novel
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) for the HECT-domain
ubiquitin ligase E6AP, which degrades p53 in HPVinfected cells [27]. Additional UbcH8 substrates have been
identified by now [28, 29]. The E1 and some E3 enzymes
have been identified, with which UbcH8 cooperates. It
has become clear that UbcH8 shows multiple enzymatic
activities [19].
UbcH8 is found to be overexpressed in esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma [30]. On the other hand,
depletion of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA2 results in
downregulation of UbcH8 in breast cancer cells. Several
studies have shown that UbcH8, induced by the histone
deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), evokes proteasomal
degradation of oncogenic proteins, indicating a potential
anti-tumorigenetic function in cancer [28]. In addition, we
observed a significant upregulation of UBE2L6 in HONE1
cells upon treatment with HDACi butyric acid (data not
shown).
In this study, we report the first instance of
epigenetic silencing of UBE2L6 in human cancer. We
demonstrate epigenetic inactivation of the UBE2L6 gene
by promoter hypermethylation in NPC cell lines and
primary NPC tumors but not in normal nasopharyngeal
epithelia. A corresponding reduction in UbcH8 protein
expression was confirmed by immunohistochemical
analysis. Moreover, UBE2L6 expression was efficiently
restored by the demethylating agent 5-aza-dC in two of
three NPC cell lines tested.
Focusing on the ISG15ylating activity of UbcH8,
we investigated the molecular mechanism of UbcH8
action in NPC. Based on the recent finding that the
ATPase VCP is ISG15ylated [23] and that adipocyte

Inactivation of UBE2L6 impairs lipolysis by
impeding ISG15ylation of VCP in NPC cells
In an attempt to clarify the functional role of
UBE2L6 in NPC tumorigenesis, we stained NPC cell lines,
which were characterized by impaired UbcH8 expression
(Fig. S3), with a lipid specific fluorescent dye Bodipy
493/503. NPC cell lines (CNE2, HONE1 and C666-1)
were stained positively, while the non-malignant cells
NP69 and NP460 did not show visible LD formation.
Moreover, ectopically introduced UBE2L6 reversibly
correlated with LDs. The UBE2L6 expressing cells had
significantly less LDs (Fig. 6A). LDs in cell lines were
quantitatively evaluated as an average fluorescence
intensity signal for single cells. ATGL expression analyzed
by Western blot in NPC cell lines CNE2 and HONE1
correlated inversely with LDs and could be increased upon
ectopic UBE2L6 expression (Fig. 6B). To further confirm
the correlation of UBE2L6 expression with ATGL, we
knocked down UBE2L6 in a human embryonic kidney
cell line 293, and found that ATGL protein was decreased
(Fig. S4).
To investigate the ISG15ylation activities of UbcH8
involved in LDs control, we analyzed ISG15 expression in
NPC tissues. NPC tumors did express significantly more
ISG15 than normal adjacent tissues (Fig. 6C). ISG15 could
be further induced in the cell lines upon IFN-α treatment

triglyceride lipase (ATGL) degradation is controlled
by VCP [28], we explored whether UbcH8 mediated
ISG15ylation of VCP would affect ATGL expression.
The ATPase activity of VCP is essential for segregation of
polyubiquitinated misfolded or regulatory client proteins
from intracellular structures for subsequent degradation
by the proteasome [31]. Congruent with the findings
in mouse adipocytes, we found that ectopic UBE2L6
expression stabilizes ATGL level in NPC cells. Since it
has been reported that ubiquitin- and ISG15- modification
can be mutually exclusive [32], one could speculate that
ISG15ylation of VCP inhibits VCP-mediated proteasomal
degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Our results are

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

further corroborated by lipid accumulation in cells with
reduced UBE2L6 expression, providing a background
to the importance of the control of ATGL protein
expression in cellular homeostasis [21]. Moreover, our
results provide a rational explanation for the previously
reported ISG15ylation of VCP. It would be interesting to
find out whether a E3 ligase of the homologous to the
E6P carboxyl terminus (HECT) family, HERC5, which
catalyses ISG15ylation of a panel of targets, cooperates
with UbcH8 in ISG15ylation in NPC cells, as E6AP,
an E3 ubiquitin ligase of HECT family, cooperates
with UbcH8 in ubiquitylation [19]. This modification
may either counteract binding of ubiquitinated species

to VCP or induce cooperation with deubiquitinating
enzymes (DUBs). Both mechanisms protect proteins from
degradation. Alternatively, ISG15ylation may interfere
with ATPase activity of VCP as it has been reported in
other systems [33].
Interestingly, we also observed promoter methylation
and silencing of another lipid binding protein, perilipin 2
(ADFP/ADRP) in NPC cells (unpublished data). ADFP is
reported to mediate lipid secretion [34]. Lipid secretion may
alert the immune system to suppress tumor proliferation
or directly inhibit tumor growth [35]. As both UbcH8 and
ADFP are differentially expressed in NPC, it is tempting to
speculate that lipid homeostasis is altered at the systemic level
in NPC. Enhanced de novo lipid synthesis is widely accepted
by now as an early and common event in many types of
cancer [36, 37]. A recent finding show that the Epstein-Barr
virus-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) upregulate the cellular
lipid metabolic process, contributing to the proliferation of
EBV positive NPC cells [38]. In human breast and prostate
cancer, overexpression of genes involved in lipid metabolism
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and cholesterol biosynthesis are associated with aggressive
phenotype and clinical behavior [39]. Even it has been noted
that lipid metabolism alteration results in tumor adaptation to
antiangiogenic treatment [40]. While previous publications
focus on tumor associated lipid synthesis, our data reveal
impairment in lipid degradation.
The functional assays described above provide
evidence that UBE2L6 functions as a TSG in human
cancers. In our case, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a
significantly shorter survival for patients whose NPC
tumors had lower UbcH8 levels, thus low level of UbcH8
protein being a marker of poor prognosis for patients
with NPC.
Recently it has been pointed out that a disabled
ISG15-pathway decreases the cellular sensitivity to
chemotherapeutic agents camptothecin (CPT), as
shown in breast cancer [41]. This might extend to other
chemotherapeutic regimens. Epigenetic silencing by
promoter hypermethylation of TSGs can be reversed by
demethylating agents. The therapeutic potential of such

agents is currently the focus of several preclinical and
clinical investigations [42]. In this context, UbcH8 may
be a valuable therapeutic target in cancer treatment, since
reactivation of UbcH8 by demethylating agents may
engage both the tumor suppressive and chemosensitising
activities of the UbcH8 protein. Additional studies
are needed to explore this potential of UBE2L6 as a
therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
In summary, our present findings show that UBE2L6
is inactivated by promoter hypermethylation in NPC.
This causes lipid accumulation in the NPC cells due to
inappropriate ATGL protein turnover. Our data indicate for
the first time, that VCP ISG15ylation opposes degradation
promoting function of VCP. We show that reduced
expression of UbcH8 correlated with poor outcome
in patients with NPC. This and other studies suggest
that UBE2L6 may be a TSG in NPC due to its ISG15conjugating function.

digital camera (Nikon 4500, Tokyo, Japan) [49, 50].  The
positive area and optical density of UbcH8-positive
tumor cells were determined by assessment of
three  random microscopic fields (25 × 10) for each
section. The immunohistochemical (IHC) index of the
representative microscopic field = positive area × optical
density (OD)/total area. Slides were blindly evaluated by
two independent investigators who were unaware of the
pathologic characteristics. The mean IHC indexes were
used for the statistical analysis. For statistical analysis,
the cases with IHC index lower than 0.285 were pooled
into the low-expression group, and the cases with IHC
index higher than 0.285 were pooled into the highexpression group.

Combined treatment with 5-aza-dC and
TSA, and microarray analysis of global gene
expression
Two NPC cell lines (CNE2 and HONE1) were used
for microarray screening. A combined treatment with the
demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC)
and the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA),
in NPC cell will synergize epigenetic upregulating of
hypermethylated genes. The NPC cells were seeded at a
density of 1 × 105 per 100 mm dish and incubated 24 hrs,
then treated with 10 μM 5-aza-dC (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.,
USA) for 96 hrs, the medium containing 5-aza-dC was
replaced every 24 hrs. Next, cells were treated with
100 nM TSA (Sigma) for another 24 hrs. The cells treated
with DMSO were used for mock control. Total RNA from
NPC cells was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen),
and subjected to human cDNA microarray analyses
by CapitalBio CO. (Beijing, China). Each sample was
analyzed twice.

Methylation specific PCR (MSP)
The sodium bisulphite modification procedure was
as described in previous study [7]. The methylation status
of the UBE2L6 promoter region was determined by MSP.
Primers distinguishing unmethylated (U) and methylated
(M) alleles were designed to amplify the sequence of
UBE2L6 from −141 to −26 bp relative to the transcription
start point.
For each set of methylation specific PCR reactions,
in vitro-methylated genomic DNA treated with sodium
bisulphite served as a positive methylation control; a water
blank control was also included. For cases with borderline
results, PCR analyses were repeated.

Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA from NPC cell lines, NPC primary
tumor biopsies and NNE was isolated with TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized
with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
was amplified from the same cDNA sample as the internal
control. The amplified PCR products were then identified
on 2% agarose gels. Images of ethidium bromide-stained
agarose gels were acquired with a CCD camera (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and semi-quantitative
analysis was performed using the Quantity-one software,
v4.4.0 (Bio-Rad).

Bisulphite genomic sequencing
Sodium bisulphite-modified DNA was subjected
to PCR with primers designed to amplify nucleotides
from −204 to +156 bp relative to the transcription start
point of the UBE2L6 gene. PCR products were then gel
purified and cloned using the pMD18-T Vector (Takara,
Tokyo, Japan) and JM109 competent E.coli cells. Colonies
were grown on agar plates, and 5 colonies of each sample
were randomly selected. Plasmids were then isolated and
purified. Sequencing was carried out using the BigDye
terminator cycle sequencing kit 3.0 (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) on an ABI 3100 sequencer

Immunohistochemistry
The Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) blocks from 69 NPC were cut into 3-μm-thick
sections. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene,
hydrated in graded alcohol solutions, and subjected to
heat induced antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (0.01 M,
pH 6.0) for 20 min at 96°C. Non-specific binding sites

24 hrs. Dye negative cells were counted by use of a
hemocytometer.
The protocol for colony formation has been
described in the previous study [7].

Plasmid constructs, Western blot and
immune-fluorescence analyses

Annexin V-FITC/PI double-labeled flow
cytometry

The authenticity of Myc-VCP, Myc-UBE2L6
and HA-ISG15 was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
The siRNA targeting UBE2L6 (sc-41685) and siRNA
control (sc-37007) were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA. Western blot and
immune-fluorescence were done according to standard
protocols. Antibodies and fluorescent dye used in this
study are anti-UBE2L6 (ab71800, Abcam), anti-Tubuline
(T8203, Sigma), anti-Caspase 3 (8G10, Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), anti-GAPDH (6C5,
Santa Cruz), anti-Ki-67 (610969, BD Biosciences, San
Diego, CA), anti-VCP (ab109240, Abcam), anti-ATGL
(F7, Santa Cruz), anti HA (ab18181, Abcam). Secondary
antibodies are anti-Rabbit/mouse IgG-HRP conjugate
(Bio-Rad), Alexa fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L),
Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen).
DAPI was from Beyotime (Hangzhou, China). IFN-αwas
purchased from Life technologies (PHC4014, Grand
Island, NY, USA).
The blots were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescent detection (Pierce, Rockford) with image
detection on XDBF-1 film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester,
NY, USA). Immuno-fluorescence images were taken on
a Nikon A1 confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

To determine apoptosis, the expression of
annexin V-FITC and exclusion of propidium iodide (PI)
(KeyGen BioTECH, Nanjing, China) were detected by
double-labeled flow cytometry. Cells transfected with
empty vector and UBE2L6-expressing vector were
collected and washed with PBS 24 hrs after transfection,
then resuspended in 100 μL binding buffer. Samples were
incubated with 5 μL Annexin V-FITC in the dark for
10 min at 4°C, then the volume was adjusted to 500 μL
with binding buffer. PI (5 μL) was added, and samples
were incubated for another 10 min at 4°C. Fluorescence
was measured with a flow cytometer (BD FACS Calibur,
San Jose, CA, USA). The quantity of apoptotic cells was
calculated as described [24, 51].

Caspase-3 activity assay
The activity of caspase-3 was determined using a
commercial Caspase-3 activity kit (Beyotime Institute
of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction.

Bodipy(403/503) staining and visualization

Human Cancer Pathway Finder PCR Array

Bodipy (D3922, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, Calif,
USA) was diluted in DMSO at 1 μg/ml and applied on
slides or tissue section for 30 min at RT. All samples
were mounted in VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) and covered with glass cover slips
No. 1 (VWR).
We examined cell line samples under epifluorescent
optics, and digital images were obtained with a laser
scanning microscope (Leica Microsystem, Heidelberg,
Germany), while frozen section with microscope from
Olympus BX53 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

The Human Cancer Pathway Finder Superarray
(PAHS-033A; SABioscience Corp., Frederick, MD, USA)
was used to explore transcriptional changes of 84 genes,
which are representative of the six biological pathways
involved in transformation and tumorigenesis, upon
exogenous expression of UBE2L6 in NPC cell line CNE2.
All genes represented by the array showed a single peak
on the melting curve characteristic to the specific products.
Excel-based PCR Array Data Analysis Software provided
by manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used
for analysis of gene expression.
The genes found to be significantly modified by
ectopic expression of UBE2L6 were further confirmed by
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR.

Statistical analysis
SPSS v11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used
for statistical analysis. The possible correlations between
of methylated sample data and clinical pathological
features were analyzed by Pearson chi-square test or
Fisher’s exact test.
The overall duration of survival was measured
from the date of radiotherapy to the date of death from
NPC. Deaths were the outcomes (events) of interest.
Those patients who died from causes other than NPC,
lost contact after last follow-up, or survived at the end

Cell proliferation and colony formation assays
Cell proliferation was evaluated by trypan blue
dye exclusion assay and immuno-staining with antiKi-67 antibody. An amount of 104 cells of unmanipulated
parental control cells, UBE2L6 transfected and empty
vector control cells were seeded in replicates into 6-well
plates. From the following day on, cells were trypsinized
and stained with a 0.4% trypan blue solution every
