b1 Integrin: Critical Path to Antiangiogenic Therapy
Resistance and Beyond
Arman Jahangiri1, Manish K. Aghi1, and W. Shawn Carbonell2

Abstract
Angiogenesis is an important tissue-level program supporting the growth of highly aggressive cancers and
early-stage metastases. However, rapid emergence of resistance to antiangiogenic therapies, such as bevacizumab, greatly limits the clinical utility of these promising approaches. The mechanisms of resistance to
antiangiogenic therapy remain incompletely understood. The tumor microenvironment has been demonstrated
to be a source of broad therapeutic resistance in multiple cancers. Much of the interaction between the cells
comprising a tumor and their microenvironment is driven by integrins. Notably, signaling downstream of
integrins in tumor cells promotes fundamental programs vital to aggressive cancer biology, including proliferation, growth, invasion, and survival signaling. These functions then can contribute to malignant phenotypes,
including metastasis, therapy resistance, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis. Accordingly,
we found b1 integrin to be functionally upregulated in tumor specimens from patients after bevacizumab failure
and in xenograft models of bevacizumab resistance. Inhibition of b1 in tumor cells with stable gene knockdown or
treatment with OS2966, a neutralizing b1 integrin monoclonal antibody, attenuated aggressive tumor phenotypes
in vitro and blocked growth of bevacizumab-resistant tumor xenografts in vivo. Thus, b1 integrins promote
resistance to antiangiogenic therapy through potentiation of multiple malignant programs facilitated by
interactions with the tumor microenvironment. The elucidation of this mechanism creates an outstanding
opportunity for improving patient outcomes in cancer. Cancer Res; 74(1); 3–7. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Aggressive cancers require adequate vasculature to support
continued tumor progression. Tumor vasculature can be
derived from preexisting host blood vessels (vessel cooption)
or through new vessel growth (angiogenesis). There is likely to
be a spectrum of vessel utilization along this continuum
depending on various contexts (1). The recognition of the
critical importance of vascularization in cancer progression
has led to the hope for a new standard of care through the
development of antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab.
However, these drugs, mostly focused on the VEGF pathway,
have not produced the clinical outcomes expected on the basis
of the dramatic preclinical results in mice. This was most
recently demonstrated in a randomized phase III trial in
patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (2). The reasons
for the disparity between preclinical and clinical results with
this therapeutic modality are multiple; however, the use of
animal models, which themselves rely heavily upon angiogen-

esis for growth, such as subcutaneous cell line–derived xenografts, likely represents a selection bias for highly angiogenic,
VEGF-dependent tumors.

Integrins and Their Role in Cellular Interaction
with the Microenvironment in Inﬂammation and
Cancer
Although angiogenesis during wound healing is tightly
regulated and self-limiting, angiogenesis associated with
chronic inﬂammation and cancer is often persistent and
abnormal. However, many of the molecules that regulate
angiogenesis in wound healing, such as integrin avb3, also
regulate pathologic angiogenesis associated with chronic
inﬂammation and cancer. Increasing evidence points to causative links between inﬂammation and cancer and suggests that
inﬂammation promotes the angiogenic switch in tumors (3).
This connection between inﬂammation and cancer underscores the complexity of tumorigenesis and the fact that
models that deﬁne cancer as driven primarily by a minor
population of genetically aberrant cells violates the basic
notions of systems biology, evolution, and pathophysiology.
Cancer is a systems-level process deﬁned by growth of malignant cells in an organ, which breaches normal tissue boundaries established by the basement membrane. In other
words, cancer requires tumor cells directly interacting with
cellular and structural components of the surrounding stroma.
Dolberg and Bissell demonstrated the importance of this
"tumor microenvironment" when they studied cells infected

with the rous sarcoma virus (4). In vitro and in early embryonicstage eggs, the cells grew aggressively. However, when transplanted into late-stage eggs, the genetically malignant program
was overridden by the microenvironmental context and the
cells incorporated into normal tissue.
Integrins are a major mediator of these interactions between
the cells comprising a tumor and their microenvironment. The
cells engaging in these interactions include monocytes, in
which intratumoral trafﬁcking and subsequent promotion of
angiogenesis are mediated by integrin a4b1 (VLA4; ref. 5).
Integrins also contribute to macrophage polarization, with b3
integrin promoting the M1 cytotoxic immunostimulating macrophage phenotype rather than the M2 immunosuppressive,
proinvasive phenotype (6). For tumor cells, these
interactions with the microenvironment are crucial to the
development of malignant features, with reversion of the
malignant phenotype demonstrated in breast cancer cells by
inhibition of b1 integrin in culture and in vivo (7). These
ﬁndings emphasize the importance of interactions between
the cells comprising a tumor with microenvironmental
integrin ligands in the extracellular matrix for tumor progression. Integrins are also crucial to VEGF-dependent and
VEGF-independent angiogenesis. On endothelial cells, reciprocal interactions between integrin avb3 and VEGFR2 are
particularly important during tumor vascularization (8). The
av integrin expression on endothelial cells is also stimulated
by VEGF-independent angiogenic growth factors such as
bFGF, TNF-a, and interleukin (IL)-8 (9). Finally, mesenchymal aspects of angiogenesis, including endothelial cell invasion and vascular remodeling, rely on a5b1 integrin (10).
We now understand the multiple parallel signaling pathways
downstream of integrin engagement that promote tumor
growth, including FAK, ERK/MAP kinase, Src, Akt, and Ras
(11–14). These pathways are upregulated as b1 levels increase.
Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the expression of b1
integrin to correlate with malignant features, including metastasis (15–17). Accordingly, b1 integrin signaling in tumor cells
has been shown to promote resistance to multiple treatment
modalities, including cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy (18), targeted therapies such as trastuzumab (19) and lapatinib (20),
and oncolytic viruses (21).

b1 Integrin and Resistance to Antiangiogenic
Therapy
Rubenstein and colleagues demonstrated that treatment of
experimental glioma xenografts with bevacizumab increased
invasiveness of tumor cells into normal adjacent brain parenchyma via vessel cooption (22). Nearly a decade later, similar
observations were made by Paez-Ribes and colleagues, including increased metastasis (23). These ﬁndings can be understood in the context of the vascularization continuum (Fig. 1).
In the face of VEGF neutralization and inhibition of neovascularization via angiogenesis, tumor cells must adapt by
becoming motile and hijacking the existing vasculature to
survive and grow. As part of this invasive process, some cells
may intravasate and enter the bloodstream, which may explain
the ﬁndings of increased metastasis in many studies (15,
16, 23). Importantly, b1 integrins have been recognized to play

4

a major role in metastases (17, 23), tumor growth (24, 25), and
invasion (26). Furthermore, Carbonell and colleagues recently
identiﬁed the b1 integrin–dependent mechanism of vessel
cooption driven by adhesion to the vascular basement membrane (27). Vessel cooption provides an instant vasculature for
newly metastatic or locally invasive cancer cells. Thus, resistance to antiangiogenic therapy can be explained by cellular
stress triggering the Darwinian survival imperative facilitated
by enhanced b1 integrin activities. We therefore explored the
hypothesis that resistance to antiangiogenic agents such as
bevacizumab is promoted by the spectrum of malignant
features driven by b1 integrin signaling through interactions
with the tumor microenvironment.
We have previously reported diverging radiologic morphology in bevacizumab-resistant glioblastomas (BRG). Some
BRGs show a nonenhancing inﬁltrating pattern, which we
found to have upregulated levels of b1 integrin when analyzed with microarray and PCR (28). These results were
further validated with immunhistochemistry, which demonstrated increased staining for b1 integrin in bevacizumabresistant patient specimens, when matched with their
respective pre–bevacizumab-treated specimens. Furthermore, ﬂow cytometry of cells from the same bevacizumab-resistant tumors also showed increased levels of b1
integrin in primary cultures compared with cells from
bevacizumab-na€ve glioblastomas. These ﬁndings were replicated in our uniquely developed U87MG cell line–derived
xenograft model of bevacizumab resistance.
Because integrin signaling reﬂects integrin turnover in focal
adhesions, we supplemented our static assays of b1 integrin
expression with dynamic assessment of b1 integrin turnover.
By engineering bevacizumab-resistant and -na€ve cell lines to
express the b1 integrin–GFP fusion protein, we were able to
apply ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching to quantify
the rate of integrin turnover in the focal adhesions formed.
Complementary to our ﬁndings above, b1 integrin turnover
as well as mobility was increased in the BRGs when compared with the na€ve control cell lines. Cell adhesion assays
further demonstrated this phenomenon when BRG cell lines
showed increased adhesion to the extracellular matrix as
compared with the na€ve cell lines. Our ﬁndings therefore
support the functional upregulation of b1 integrin in glioblastomas that evolve to become resistant to antiangiogenic
therapy.
We found increased hypoxia in our BRG patient samples
compared with their paired na€ve samples, which directly
correlated with the increased b1 integrin in the BRGs. In
vitro studies of U87MGs and two non–central nervous
system carcinoma cell lines, HT-1080 and MDA-MB-231,
supported this ﬁnding with a signiﬁcant increase in the
expression of b1 integrin following hypoxia, suggesting a
conserved survival mechanism. The hypoxia that results
from antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab therefore
may play a major role in b1 integrin upregulation.
The role for b1 integrin in the aggressive mesenchymal
phenotype of BRGs was further characterized by allowing
bevacizumab-resistant cell lines to express short hairpin
RNA (shRNA)-targeting b1 integrin (shBETA1) in vitro. This

Figure 1. Summary of the vascularization continuum. The vascularization continuum recognizes the multiple mechanisms by which tumor cells will
vascularize to survive and grow (simpliﬁed here to only consider dominant mechanisms of vessel cooption and remodeling). Aggressive tumor growth is
characterized by angiogenesis, often with cooption at the growth fronts. When VEGF-dependent angiogenesis is blocked with agents such as bevacizumab,
the vascularization continuum shunts toward vessel cooption and related b1 integrin-mediated tumor cell functions. Blue denotes blood vessels,

led to a more epithelioid morphology with increased cell size
in shBETA1 clones. Functionally, these cells lacked mesenchymal characteristics, as shown by static and dynamic in
vitro assays demonstrating decreased adhesion, cell spreading, and migration. Furthermore, the knockdown cells displayed reduced in vitro proliferation. Spheroid formation in
acidic media, a vital adaptive response used by tumor cells,
was attenuated in U87-shBETA1 and BRG-shBETA1 cells
compared with controls. Inhibiting glioma cells with OS2966
in vitro had similar outcomes as the knockdown in all of the
above assays.
We then established preclinical proof-of-concept for the
critical role of b1 integrin in BRGs in multiple xenograft
models. Systemic treatment of subcutaneous BRG-derived
xenografts with two different doses of OS2966 led to signiﬁcantly smaller tumors than placebo. This treatment also
proved effective in orthotopic BRG–derived xenografts. Fulldose combination therapy with bevacizumab and OS2966 led
to cutaneous ulceration of 100% of U87MG subcutaneous
xenografts, suggestive of synergy. We then alternated low-dose
(1 mg/kg) bevacizumab and OS2966 and compared it with the
standard dose of 10 mg/kg of bevacizumab alone. The combination therapy proved equally effective, with similar rates of

complete regression in both groups. This may help reduce the
morbidity of antiangiogenic approaches.
In sum, we have established that b1 integrin is a critical
driving force in therapeutic resistance and is a potentially
promising adjunctive target in combination with antiangiogenic therapies such as bevacizumab. Thus, targeting b1
integrins holds outstanding potential for improving patient
outcomes in glioblastoma.

Current Challenges and Limitations of Targeting
b1 Integrin
Successful pharmacologic targeting of b1 integrin will
require the development of specialized molecular inhibitors
or humanized monoclonal antibodies. Although the ubiquitous cellular expression of integrins may raise concerns about
the safety of this approach, chronic administration of up to 20
mg/kg hamster anti-mouse b1 integrin to nude mice resulted
in no observable toxicity for up to 4 weeks (7). Accordingly,
OS2966, a ﬁrst-in-class, ligand-selective, humanized and deimmunized neutralizing b1 integrin monoclonal antibody, is
currently under development for clinical testing.
In the case of glioblastoma, if penetration of b1 integrin
blocking antibodies through the blood–brain barrier (BBB)

after parenteral administration proved suboptimal, intratumoral delivery through strategies such as convectionenhanced or selective endovascular delivery could be considered as well. However, we have also shown in pilot studies that
systemically delivered OS2966 successfully targets orthotopic
U87 xenografts through the BBB (A. Jahangiri and M. Aghi;
unpublished data).

Implications and Future Directions
Our ﬁndings underscore the importance of b1 integrin in
resistance to antiangiogenic therapy and are part of an emerging literature showing the importance of b1 integrin in the
evolution of tumor resistance to multiple therapeutic modalities (18–20). This is consistent with the ability of b1 integrin to
stimulate invasion and proliferation and its central role in
engaging the microenvironment owing to its ability to bind
multiple extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules.
Future work will need to identify more detailed mechanisms
by which b1 integrin is upregulated during therapeutic resistance. These mechanisms could be transcriptional or posttranslational, and regulators could include hypoxia or the
VEGF depletion caused by antiangiogenic therapy. It will also
need to be determined which a heterodimer partners and
respective ligands (23) are important for b1 integrin-mediated
therapeutic resistance and to what extent endogenous integrin
modulators contribute to the witnessed therapeutic resistance.
On the basis of the prior literature, it is likely the relevance of
these ﬁndings are much broader than those described in the
present study. Our BRG primary and cell lines were derived
from patient tumors that failed standard therapy with temozolomide and radiation, as well as bevacizumab. Thus, these
lines are likely resistant to multiple therapies and may repre-

sent a clinically predictive model. These results also raise the
possibility that other angiogenic cancers, such as breast and
colon, may beneﬁt from the addition of anti-b1 integrin
strategies to antiangiogenic therapy. This may particularly
create a new opportunity for such agents in metastatic breast
cancer considering the recent revocation of accelerated
approval of bevacizumab in these patients.
In conclusion, very few candidate molecules have been
demonstrated to be a critical gatekeeper for nearly all components of the "Hallmarks of Cancer" as b1 integrin (29). From its
fundamental role in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, exponential growth, survival in the face of various therapeutic regimens and cellular stresses, mesenchymal phenotypes, and
local invasion and metastasis, targeting b1 integrin has the
potential to signiﬁcantly improve outcomes for patients with
cancer.
