Abstract
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors, such as 17allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG, tanespimycin), which is currently in phase II/phase III clinical trials,
are promising new anticancer agents. Here, we explored
acquired resistance to HSP90 inhibitors in glioblastoma (GB),
a primary brain tumor with poor prognosis. GB cells were
exposed continuously to increased 17-AAG concentrations.
Four 17-AAG–resistant GB cell lines were generated. Highresistance levels with resistance indices (RI = resistant line
IC50/parental line IC50) of 20 to 137 were obtained rapidly
(2–8 weeks). After cessation of 17-AAG exposure, RI decreased
and then stabilized. Cross-resistance was found with other
ansamycin benzoquinones but not with the structurally
unrelated HSP90 inhibitors, radicicol, the purine BIIB021,
and the resorcinylic pyrazole/isoxazole amide compounds
VER-49009, VER-50589, and NVP-AUY922. An inverse correlation between NAD(P)H/quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)
expression/activity and 17-AAG IC50 was observed in the
resistant lines. The NQO1 inhibitor ES936 abrogated the
differential effects of 17-AAG sensitivity between the parental
and resistant lines. NQO1 mRNA levels and NQO1 DNA
polymorphism analysis indicated different underlying mechanisms: reduced expression and selection of the inactive
NQO1*2 polymorphism. Decreased NQO1 expression was also
observed in a melanoma line with acquired resistance to 17AAG. No resistance was generated with VER-50589 and NVPAUY922. In conclusion, low NQO1 activity is a likely
mechanism of acquired resistance to 17-AAG in GB, melanoma, and, possibly, other tumor types. Such resistance can
be overcome with novel HSP90 inhibitors. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is
currently of major interest as an anticancer drug target. Through
its role in regulating the conformation, stability and function of
several key oncogenic client proteins, HSP90 seems to be essential
in maintaining malignant transformation and in increasing the

survival, growth, and invasive potential of cancer cells (1, 2). 17Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG; tanespimycin)
was the first-in-class HSP90 inhibitor to enter clinical trials in
both adult and pediatric patients (3–5) and is currently in phase II/
phase III clinical trials in adults. Signs of clinical activity have been
seen with 17-AAG in different tumor types, such as melanoma,
breast, and prostate cancers, and also in multiple myeloma (3, 5, 6).
The combinatorial effect of HSP90 inhibitors on multiple
oncogenic pathways explains the broad spectrum of anticancer
activity of HSP90 inhibitors and allows them to overcome
resistance to various other anticancer therapies (6–9). This
combinatorial action might also render less likely the probability
of cells escaping treatment with HSP90 inhibitors by using
alternative resistant pathways. Known determinants of intrinsic
sensitivity to geldanamycin (GA) derivatives include expression of
key client proteins, e.g., ERBB2 (10), HSP90 family members (11),
and cochaperone proteins, e.g., HSP72 (12), AHA1 (13), HSP27 (14),
as well as cell cycle and apoptotic regulators (15). In addition, it is
known that intrinsic resistance may be due to expression of high
levels of P-glycoprotein (PgP; ref. 16) and low levels of NAD(P)H/
quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1; DT-diaphorase; refs. 16, 17).
However, there are few reports in the literature on acquired
resistance to HSP90 inhibitors (18, 19). Three breast cancer cell
lines with acquired resistance to GA derivatives have been
described: an acquired GA-resistant cell line presenting crossresistance with the structurally related HSP90 inhibitor herbimycin
A and the cytotoxic agent doxorubucin (18) and also two acquired
17-AAG–resistant lines remaining sensitive to the structurally
unrelated HSP90 inhibitor radicicol have been reported in abstract
form (19). However, the mechanisms of resistance were not
identified.
Glioblastoma (GB) cells are dependent on a range of activated
oncoproteins and signaling pathways that require HSP90 function
(20). Thus, benzoquinone ansamycin HSP90 inhibitors might be
interesting agents to improve treatment results in GB, a primary
brain tumor with particularly dismal prognosis (21). In support
of this, all GB cell lines to date treated with GA and its derivatives,
17-AAG and the more soluble analogue 17-demethoxy-17-dimethylaminoethylaminogeldanamycin (17-DMAG; alvespimycin), were
sensitive to these compounds (8, 22–24). Moreover, GA derivatives
synergize with treatments used in these tumors, such as irradiation
(22, 23) and anti–epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy
(24), and are able to overcome in vitro GB resistance to SN38 (8).
The general concern with the development of resistance leading to
cancer treatment failure may be especially relevant in GB as shown
by their high rate of recurrence and their poor curability with
current therapies (21). Thus, exploring possible mechanism of
acquired resistance to HSP90 inhibitors in GB cells is an important

In vitro Acquired Resistance to 17-AAG

goal for the potential development of these drugs as part of the
therapeutic arsenal against GB. In addition, such mechanisms may
also be relevant to other cancers.
To understand the potential mechanisms of resistance and
determine the possible impact on the clinical use of this drug,
we have successfully generated in vitro acquired resistance to 17AAG in two adult and two pediatric human GB cell lines. We
show that the common acquired mechanism of 17-AAG
resistance was reduced expression of NQO1. This mechanism
was also identified in a BRAF mutant melanoma cell line made
resistant to 17-AAG.

Materials and methods
Cell line culture. Adult (U87MG, SF268) and pediatric (KNS42)
human GB cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC; LGC Promochem), National Cancer Institute
(NCI), and Japan Cancer Research Resources cell bank, respectively.
The pediatric line SF188 was kindly provided by Professor Daphne
Haas-Kogan (University of California). The melanoma cell line
WM266.4 was obtained from ATCC.
The naturally high NQO1-expressing line HT29 was obtained
from ATCC (16). The human colon cancer isogenic pair BEneg/BE2
was produced in-house (16, 25). The human colon cancer line BE
vector control (BEneg) carries the NQO1*2 polymorphism, which

did not alter transcription but led to an altered protein (Pro187Ser)
with diminished catalytic activity and that was rapidly degraded by
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (25, 26). Its isogenic counterpart
BE-F397 clone 2 (BE2) was transfected with NQO1 (16, 25).
All lines were grown as monolayers in DMEM containing 10%
FCS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and 2 mmol/L nonessential amino acids
in 5% CO2 and were free from Mycoplasma contamination
(VenorGeM Mycoplasma PCR Detection kit, Minerva Biolabs).
Compounds. The ansamycin benzoquinone HSP90 inhibitors
17-AAG and 17-DMAG and their metabolite 17-amino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AG) were obtained from Axxora Ltd.,
Autogenbioclear, and NCI, respectively. The structurally unrelated
HSP90 inhibitors used were radicicol (Sigma-Aldrich), the purinescaffold HSP90 inhibitor BIIB021 (27), and the resorcinylic diaryl
pyrazole/isoxazole amide agents VER-49009, VER-50589, and NVPAUY922 (refs. 28, 29), which were prepared at our Institute or by
Vernalis Ltd. Chemotherapeutic agents temozolomide, cisplatin,
and SN38 were obtained from Apin Chemicals Ltd., Johnson
Matthey Technology Center, and Sanofi-Aventis, respectively. The
NQO1 inhibitor ES936 (5-methoxy-1,2-dimethyl-3-[(4-nitrophenoxy)methyl]indole-4,7-dione; ref. 17), was kindly provided by Professor Christopher J. Moody (University of Nottingham). A 2 mmol/L
stock solution for 17-AAG, 17-AG, and NVP-AUY922, 5 mmol/L
stock solution for SN38, and 10 mmol/L stock solution for 17DMAG, radicicol, BIIB021, VER-49009, VER-50589, and ES936 were

prepared in DMSO. Temozolomide and cisplatin were made up in
saline at 20 and 2.5 mmol/L stock solutions, respectively.
Growth inhibition studies. Growth inhibition was determined
using the sulforhodamine B assay (SRB), as described previously
(16, 30). The IC50 was calculated as the drug concentration that
inhibits cell growth by 50% compared with control. The NQO1
inhibitor ES936 was added at the highest nontoxic concentration
(10–15% of cell growth inhibition).
Development of 17-AAG acquired resistant cell lines. Early
passage SF268, U87MG, SF188, and KNS42 cells were seeded into
T75 flasks. The cells in one flask were serially passaged as an
untreated control along with 17-AAG–treated cells in another flask
at an initial concentration of 1 IC50, as previously determined by
SRB. Cells were exposed continuously to compound until 80%
confluent. When treated cells were able to tolerate this concentration, the compound concentration was then increased as follows:
2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 IC50. The resistance index (RI) was
defined by the ratio of IC50 resistant line/IC50 parental line.
Unless otherwise stated, the resistant lines were cultured
without 17-AAG for at least 3 weeks before analysis.
Western blot analysis. Procedures for cell lysates and Western
blotting were as previously described (31). Immunodetection was
performed using antibodies listed in the supplementary data
(Supplementary Table S1).
NQO1 enzyme assay. NQO1 activity was measured by a
spectrophotometric assay, in which the rate of reduction of
cytochrome c was monitored at 550 nm (25). Briefly, protein
lysates were diluted in lysis buffer (as for Western blot) at a protein
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. An aliquot (10 AL) of the diluted
protein lysate was added to the reaction mixture containing
the initial electron acceptor menadione (10 Amol/L), the terminal
electron acceptor cytochrome c (70 Amol/L), and NADH

(500 Amol/L) as the source of reducing equivalents. All solutions
were prewarmed at 37jC and assays were performed in the
presence or absence of dicoumarol, an NQO1 inhibitor (1 mmol/L).
NQO1 activity was taken as the dicoumarol inhibitable activity and
was expressed as nanomoles of cytochrome c reduced per minute
per milligram of protein. The extinction coefficient for cytochrome
c of 21.1 mmol/L/cm was used in the calculations.
NQO1 mRNA levels by quantitative real-time reverse
transcription–PCR. Cells were lysed in triplicate, and RNA was
extracted using triazol (1 mL/T25 flask, Life Technologies Ltd.)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA (1 Ag) was
reverse transcribed using Superscript II (Life Technologies Ltd.)
and random hexamer primers (100 pmol, Invitrogen Ltd.) in a
final volume of 20 AL according to the manufacturers’
instructions. RNA quantification was determined on the NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific) measuring the absorbance at
260 nm (A 260). RNA purity was defined by a ratio A 260/A 280 of
1.9 to 2.1. NQO1 gene expression was analyzed using Assays-onDemand Gene Expression Product Hs00168547-m1 (Applied
Biosystems). TaqMan analysis was carried out according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using an Applied Biosystems 7900 HT
sequence detector. Each assay sample was analyzed in triplicate
and multiplexed to facilitate measurement of gene expression
level relative to TBP (TBP control reagents, Applied Biosystems)
using the standard curve method. The PCR reactions were
performed under the following conditions: 50jC for 2 min; 95jC
for 5 min; 40 cycles at 95jC for 45 s, 45jC for 45 s, and 72jC for
45 s; and 1 cycle at 72jC for 10 min. Results were presented as
the mean F SD of NQO1/TBP mRNA concentration ratio.
NQO1 genotyping. The inactivating NQO1*2 polymorphism was
genotyped as previously described (32). Briefly, a 284-bp fragment
containing a restriction site inactivating polymorphism at the

scraping. The cell pellet was lysed, and protein was extracted as for
Western blot analysis. Three samples of each cell line at a
concentration of 2.5 mg/mL of proteins were analyzed in duplicate.
Total glutathione S-transferase (GST) concentration was determined with the GST assay kit from Cayman Chemical according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

were carried out within guidelines set out by The Institute of
Cancer Research’s animal ethics committee and national
guidelines (33).
Cells (2.5  106) were injected s.c. in both flanks of female
NCr athymic mice. When tumors were of 5 to 6 mm in mean
diameter, mice were treated i.p. with either vehicle 43% ethanol
(200 proof), 33% propylene glycol, 24% cremaphor or 80 mg/kg
once daily 17-AAG, five days per week. Tumors were harvested on
day 11, 24 h after the last dose. Protein lysates were prepared as
previously described (34) and NQO1 immunoblotting performed
as above.
Statistical analysis. All values are mean F SD of at least 3
independent experiments. Statistical significance was calculated by
a two-tailed paired t test. The nonparametric two-tailed Spearman
test was used to estimate the correlation between NQO1 enzyme
activity and 17-AAG sensitivity. P value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
Development of GB cell lines with acquired resistance to 17AAG. Acquired resistance to 17-AAG developed rapidly in GB lines.
SF268-RA12, SF188-RA6, and KNS42-RA4 were resistant up to 12,
6, and 4 IC50 concentration of 17-AAG and were generated in 5, 8,
and 2 weeks, respectively. There were no morphologic or growth rate
differences between the resistant lines and their parental counterparts (data not shown). By contrast, the U87MG-RA6 line, which was
resistant up to 6 IC50 of 17-AAG, took 26 weeks to obtain and
tended to grow slower than the parental line U87MG (doubling time
of 57.2 F 4.2 and 38.3 F 9.0 hours, respectively; P = 0.0571).
The resistant lines exhibited varying levels of acquired 17-AAG
resistance (Fig. 1). Under continuous drug pressure (drug on), both
adult GB resistant lines presented high levels of resistance to 17AAG with RI (RI = IC50 resistant line / IC50 parental line) values of
104.5 F 111.6 (SF268-RA12) and 137.3 F 61.6 (U87MG-RA6). RI
values for the pediatric GB lines were somewhat lower: 23.0 F 12.6
(SF188-RA6) and 20.4 F 11.6 (KNS42-RA4). Despite its lower RI, the
KNS42-RA4 sensitivity to 17-AAG (IC50, 612.1 F 280.7 nmol/L) was
comparable with adult resistant lines, as the KNS42 parental line
was less sensitive to 17-AAG than the other parental lines.
Increasing 17-AAG concentrations to 6, 12, and 24 IC50 for
3 weeks in KNS42-RA4, U87MG-RA6, and SF286-RA12 did not
further increase the RI values, suggesting a mechanism of
resistance that was saturable. However, the RI for SF188-RA6
further increased 2.7-fold (IC50, 531.2 nmol/L) when treated with
12 IC50 of 17-AAG for 3 weeks.
In the absence of 17-AAG treatment (drug off), the RI decreased
(3.2-fold, 3.6-fold, and 23.3-fold) in SF188-RA6, SF268-RA12, and
U87MG-RA6 after 2 weeks, then remained stable up to 8.3, 26.1,

and 8.9 weeks, respectively. For KNS42-RA4, the RI increased to
33.0 F 11.7 and then stabilized.
Molecular effects of 17-AAG in the SF268-RA12 resistant and
SF268 parental lines. To evaluate the functional consequences
of 17-AAG resistance, we compared molecular effects induced
by 17-AAG treatment in the parental SF268 and the resistant
SF268-RA12 lines at both 5 IC50 of the parental line (60 nmol/L)
and at 5 IC50 of the resistant line (600 nmol/L; Fig. 2).
Consistent with the molecular signature of HSP90 inhibition
(3, 29), treatment of the parental line with 60 nmol/L of
17-AAG caused depletion of HSP90 client proteins ERBB2,
AKT, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) by 24 hours, along
with an induction of HSP72. ERBB2 was the most sensitive client
and was depleted as early as 8 hours; phosphorylated AKT was
depleted more rapidly and to a greater extent than total AKT,
consistent with previous published data (35, 36). As previously
described with other client proteins (37), a transient increase in
C-RAF was observed at 8 hours followed by later depletion.
Although not a client protein, phosphorylation of extracellular

signal-regulated kinase 1/2 was reduced as a result of depletion of
upstream RAF proteins. A recovery of client protein level in the
parental line was observed from 48 hours. In the resistant SF268RA12 line treated at 5 IC50 of the parental line, no depletion of
CDK4 or AKT was observed. ERBB2 and CRAF were depleted at
48 hours but recovered very rapidly at 72 hours. When both the
parental and resistant cells were treated at 600 nmol/L, the
molecular profile of HSP90 inhibition was observed in both
parental and resistant lines and no recovery of proteins was
detected.
Cross-resistance with other HSP90 inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents. The structurally related agents 17-DMAG
and 17-AG partially circumvented acquired 17-AAG resistance.
However, cross-resistance was still seen with RI values ranging
between 5.1 to 7.2 and 1.5 to 12.6, respectively (Fig. 3). No crossresistance (RI < 1.0) was found with the structurally unrelated
HSP90 inhibitors, radicicol, BIIB021, VER-49009, VER-50589, or
NVP-AUY922, suggesting a resistance mechanism specific to
ansamycin benzoquinones.

Figure 4. Expression of NQO1, HSP, and DNA repair proteins in the parental and 17-AAG–resistant GB cell lines. Western blots were performed with lysates from
SF268 parental and SF268-RA12 resistant lines (A), U87MG parental and U87MG-RA6 resistant lines (B), SF188 parental and SF188-RA6 resistant lines (C ),
and KNS42 parental and KNS42-RA4 resistant lines (D ). Three samples from parental and resistant lines were harvested at 80% confluence. The resistant cells were
analyzed after continuous 17-AAG pressure (+) and after cessation of 17-AAG pressure (), as described in Materials and Methods. The human colon cancer cell
line BE vector control (BEneg), which carries the inactivating NQO1*2 polymorphism, was used as the negative control (16, 25). NQO1-positive controls were the
isogenic counterpart transfected with NQO1 BE-F397 clone 2 (BE2) and the naturally high-NQO1–expressing human colon cancer cell line HT29 (16). The human colon
cancer cell line HT29 was used as a positive control for MGMT (47), MLH1, and MSH2 (48). The human colon cancer cell line HCT116 was used as a negative
control for MLH1 (48) and a positive control for HSP27 (49). The parental human ovarian cancer cell line CH1 and the doxorubicin-resistant cell line CH1DoxR were
negative and positive controls for PgP expression (50), which was not detected in any of the GB lines (data not shown).

No cross-resistance was observed with the chemotherapeutic
agents used (temozolomide, cisplatin, and SN38), except for
temozolomide in SF268-RA12 (RI, 4.8 F 1.4; P = 0.0167).
PgP and NQO1 expression in the parental and acquired 17AAG–resistant GB lines. As the intrinsic cellular sensitivity to 17AAG is dependent on the multidrug efflux protein PgP (16) and the
oxidoreductase NQO1 (16, 17), basal expression of these proteins
was determined.
No detectable expression of PgP was observed in any of the
parental or 17-AAG–resistant lines (data not shown).
Parental GB lines exhibited a range of NOQ1 protein levels, with
highest expression in SF268 cells and lowest expression in KNS42
cells (Fig. 4). Under continuous 17-AAG exposure, NOQ1 protein
expression was reduced to undetectable levels in the 17-AAG–
resistant lines, except for SF188-RA6 wherein NQO1 protein
expression was still decreased, but to a lesser extent. After cessation
of 17-AAG exposure, NQO1 protein expression recovered to a level
similar to their parental lines in U87MG-RA6 and SF188-RA6 cells.
However, NQO1 expression remained virtually undetectable in the
SF268-RA12 and KNS42-RA4 cells. These results suggest that NQO1
expression may play a role in 17-AAG–resistant GB lines.
NQO1 enzymatic activity in GB lines with acquired 17-AAG
resistance. As expected (16, 25), there was no detectable activity in
the non–NQO1-expressing BEneg colon cancer line (Table 1). NQO1
activity was 644.6 F 299.8 nmol/min/mg of protein for the NQO1transfected BE2 line and 8-fold higher in constitutively high-NQO1–
expressing HT29 human colon cancer line. The NQO1 activity in
GB parental lines was similar to the NQO1 activity in BE2. The
KNS42 line expressed the lowest activity, and this was still only 2.5fold lower than in the BE2 line.
Under 17-AAG exposure, the NQO1 activity decreased to a nearly
undetectable level in the 17-AAG–resistant lines KNS42-RA4,

SF268-RA12, and U87MG-RA6. In SF188-RA6, NQO1 activity
decreased by 3.3-fold and remained at an intermediate level.
Cessation of 17-AAG exposure led to some recovery in NQO1
activity, except for KNS42-RA4 wherein NQO1 activity remained
undetectable. SF188-RA6 NQO1 activity returned to the level of the
parental line despite persistence of 17-AAG resistance. SF268-RA12
and U87MG-RA6 NQO1 levels remained intermediate.
The nonparametric two-tailed Spearman test showed an inverse
correlation between the NQO1 activity and the IC50 of the parental
and resistant cell lines, with the exception of SF188-RA6, which
was an outlier (Fig. 5). These results suggest that NQO1 activity
provides a potential explanation for the 17-AAG resistance in our
GB lines and that an additional mechanism might also be present
in SF188-RA6 line.
Effects of NQO1 inhibitor ES936 in GB lines with acquired
17-AAG resistance. As expected, the NQO1 inhibitor ES936
significantly reduced the cellular sensitivity to 17-AAG in the
NQO1-transfected line (BE2), whereas the isogenic vector control
BEneg line, which lacks NQO1 expression, was unaffected (25).
We then determined the effect of ES936 on the IC50 for 17-AAG
in the GB lines and calculated the NQO1 inhibition ratio as IC50
for 17-AAG in the presence of ES936/IC50 for 17-AAG alone
(Table 2).
In the constitutively high-NQO1–expressing SF268 parental
line, 17-AAG IC50 was significantly increased (P = 0.0138) in the
presence of ES936. In contrast, the 17-AAG IC50 in the non–NQO1expressing resistant SF268-RA12 line was unaffected by ES936. This
is reflected in the NQO1 inhibition ratio. Similarly, in KNS42
parental line, ES936 decreased 17-AAG sensitivity to the level of its
resistant counterpart KNS42-RA4 whereas no modification was
induced in this non–NQO1-expressing resistant line. In U87MG and
SF188 parental lines, but to a lesser extent in their resistant

counterparts, ES936 decreased 17-AAG sensitivity, reflecting the
residual NQO1 activity observed in U87MG-RA6 and SF188-RA6.
These results further confirm that NQO1 activity plays a major
role in the mechanism of 17-AAG resistance in the GB cell lines.
NQO1 mRNA level in GB lines with acquired 17-AAG
resistance. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription–PCR
results for NQO1 are presented in Table 1. HT29 exhibited the
highest NQO1 mRNA content. BEneg and BE2 had similar NQO1
mRNA levels. The NQO1 mRNA levels in the GB parental lines were
similar to that in the BE lines. In the resistant line SF268-RA12, a
12-fold decrease in NQO1 mRNA level was observed under 17-AAG
pressure compared with the parental line. After cessation of 17AAG, NQO1 mRNA levels increased to an intermediate level. A
similar tendency was observed with U87MG-RA6. In contrast, no
change in the NQO1 mRNA levels was observed in the pediatric
resistant GB lines SF188 and KNS42 with or without 17-AAG
pressure. These results suggested different mechanisms of reduced
NQO1 expression/activity between the adult and pediatric 17AAG–resistant GB lines studied here.
NQO1 genotyping in GB lines with acquired 17-AAG
resistance. As expected (16, 25), HT29 carried the wild-type
NQO1*1 polymorphism (Hinf1 undigested PCR fragment), whereas
BEneg/BE2 carried the inactivating NQO1*2 polymorphism (Hinf1
digested PCR fragment; Supplementary Fig. S1).

Only the wild-type NQO1*1 polymorphism was detected in the
parental adult GB lines U87MG and SF268 and the pediatric GB
line SF188 and their 17-AAG–resistant counterparts. In the parental
pediatric GB line KNS42, both NQO1*1 and NQO1*2 polymorphisms were detected whereas only the inactivating NQO1*2
polymorphism was detected in the 17-AAG–resistant line KNS42RA4. These results suggested that the 17-AAG pressure has selected
a KNS42 subpopulation homozygous for NOQ1*2 polymorphism
and, thus, resistant to 17-AAG.
Reduced NQO1 expression in U87MG parental GB tumor
xenografts treated with 17-AAG. When U87MG parental adult GB
tumor xenografts were treated with a therapeutic regimen of 80
mg/kg/d for 5 days a week for 2 weeks, a decrease in NQO1 protein
expression was observed by immunoblot (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Acquired 17-AAG resistance in the WM266.4 melanoma line.
To determine if the NQO1-mediated mechanism of acquired
resistance to 17-AAG was restricted to GB cells, a 17-AAG–resistant
melanoma line, WM266.4-RA6, was generated after 6 months of
continuous drug exposure (RI, 12.5 F 1.3). Resistance persisted but
to a lesser degree after 4 weeks cessation of exposure (RI, 2.5 F 0.3).
Cross-resistance was observed with 17-DMAG but not with VER50589 or a panel of cytotoxic drugs (Supplementary Fig. S3A). As
seen in 17-AAG–resistant GB lines, NQO1 protein expression was
depleted in the resistant melanoma line when compared with the

parental line (Supplementary Fig. S3B). NQO1 activity (Supplementary Fig. S3C) was very high in the parental line (11.4-fold NQO1
activity in BE2), reduced in the resistant line under 17-AAG pressure
to the level seen in BE2, and partially recovered after cessation of
17-AAG (3-fold NQO1 activity in BE2). NQO1 activity was inversely
correlated to 17-AAG IC50 (P = 0.0369; Supplementary Fig. S3C).
ES936 significantly reduced WM266.4 parental line 17-AAG sensitivity to a level similar to the resistant line (P = 0.0441; Supplementary
Fig. S3D) but also tended to reduce 17-AAG sensitivity in the
resistant WM266.4-RA6 line, albeit to a lesser extent, due the residual
NQO1 activity in this resistant line. Taken together, these results
suggested that NQO1 down-regulation was likely to be the
mechanism of resistance in the WM266.4-RA6 melanoma line.
Levels of HSPs in the 17-AAG–resistant GB lines. HSP90 and
cochaperones HSP72 and HSP27 showed increased expression
under continuous exposure to 17-AAG compared with their
parental counterpart but returned to the basal level when 17AAG exposure was stopped (Fig. 4). No HSP27 protein expression
was detected in the SF268 parental/resistant lines.
Exploration of cross-resistance to temozolomide in the
SF268-RA12 GB line. Figure 3 shows that the 17-AAG–resistant
GB line SF268-RA12 was cross-resistant to temozolomide. ES936
did not alter the sensitivity to temozolomide in either the parental
SF268 or resistant SF268-RA12 lines (data not shown), indicating
the involvement of a mechanism of resistance not involving NQO1.
The absence of increased expression of mismatch repair proteins
(MLH1 and MSH2 immunoblotting; Fig. 4) and increased GST
activity (GST enzymatic assay; data not shown) in the resistant
compared with its parental counterpart excluded the role of
these mechanisms of resistance to temozolomide (38). In contrast,
O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein levels
were undetectable in the SF268 parental line but increased in
17-AAG–resistant SF268-RA12 cell line (Fig. 4). No changes in
MGMT expression were observed in the other parental/resistant
pairs. The results suggest that MGMT expression might participate
in the cross-resistance of the SF268-RA12 line to temozolomide.

Discussion
With the clinical development of HSP90 inhibitors and the first
promising results of 17-AAG in cancer patients (3, 5, 6), it is

www.aacrjournals.org

important to understand potential mechanisms of resistance to
these agents. Although some intrinsic mechanisms of resistance are
known (16), few studies report acquired resistance to HSP90
inhibitors and no mechanism of acquired resistance has been
described (18, 19).
This present work describes in vitro acquired resistance to 17AAG in four human GB cell lines derived from both adult (SF268,
U87MG) and pediatric (SF188, KNS42) tumors. We have shown that
reduced NQO1 expression/activity is the main mechanism of
resistance and extended this finding to another tumor type
exemplified by a BRAF mutant melanoma cell line (WM266.4).
Cross-resistance with the analogue 17-DMAG, which is also in
clinical trial, and the 17-AAG metabolite 17-AG, but not with
structurally unrelated HSP90 inhibitors, led us to hypothesize
mechanisms of resistance common to ansamycin benzoquinones
rather than modifications to the target HSP90. We therefore
explored factors previously known to have a marked effect on
intrinsic sensitivity of cancer cells to 17-AAG, namely the drug
efflux pump PgP (16) and the oxidoreductase NQO1 (16, 17).
PgP protein was undetectable in all the parental/resistant pairs,
allowing us to exclude this mechanism. In contrast, we discovered
that reduced NQO1 expression/activity was implicated in the
acquired resistant phenotype of all of 17-AAG–resistant GB lines
studied.
NQO1/DT-diaphorase is an obligate two-electron–reducing
flavin-containing enzyme using either NADH or NADPH as
reducing cofactors to catalyze the direct reduction of quinones to
hydroquinones. Ansamycin benzoquinone HSP90 inhibitors, such
as 17-AAG, 17-DMAG, and 17-AG, are metabolized by this enzyme
to their more active hydroquinone counterpart (16, 39), and low
constitutive NQO1 activity has been linked to in vitro and in vivo
primary resistance to 17-AAG (16). The effect of low NQO1 activity
is less for 17-DMAG and 17-AG (16, 39), thus explaining the
lower degree of resistance for these two compounds in our
17-AAG–resistant lines. We observed a significant inverse correlation between NQO1 expression/activity and 17-AAG resistance
(P < 0.05) and showed that the NQO1 inhibitor ES936 abrogated
the differential 17-AAG sensitivity between the parental and
resistant lines. In addition, analysis of NQO1 mRNA levels
suggested different mechanisms leading to reduced NQO1

expression/activity in the resistant GB lines, in particular between
the adult and pediatric lines studied here. In the pediatric KNS42RA4 cells, resistance was due to the selection of a subpopulation
homozygous for the inactivating NQO1*2 polymorphism, explaining the stability of the resistance after 17-AAG cessation.
Interestingly, the persistence of 17-AAG resistance after cessation
of treatment in the pediatric SF188-RA6 cells while NQO1 activity
returned to the parental level suggested the presence of additional
mechanisms of resistance, albeit restricted to GA derivatives. This
will need further investigation.
Taken together, this study has clearly shown that reduced NQO1
activity, by one means or another, is a likely mechanism of
in vitro acquired resistance to 17-AAG in GB. Loss of NQO1 led
to high levels of acquired resistance to 17-AAG (RI, 20–137)
that persisted after cessation of 17-AAG treatment (7–26 weeks),
albeit at a lower level (RI, 6–33). Resistance developed rapidly
in vitro (2–8 weeks of exposure). Furthermore, reduced NQO1
expression was also observed in U87MG xenografts after only 2
weeks of 17-AAG treatment. The NQO1-mediated mechanism of
17-AAG resistance occurred in cells with high constitutive levels of
NQO1 and was independent of the genetic background (different
EGFR, PTEN, and p53 status; data not shown), the adult or
pediatric origin of the GB cells, and the cell type (GB and melanoma).
Our results suggest that a 17-AAG–induced decrease in NQO1
activity may be of potential concern for the clinical use of 17-AAG in
GB, as well as in melanoma, a tumor type wherein clinical activity
has been observed (3, 6). This resistance mechanism may also be
applicable to other tumor types. To date, there are no published
clinical data on NQO1 expression/activity in tumor biopsy samples
from patients before and after 17-AAG treatment.
Several options might be considered to overcome the NQO1mediated mechanism of resistance. Although less potent than its
hydroquinone metabolite, 17-AAG itself is still an active HSP90
inhibitor (39). Our results suggest that the NQO1-mediated
mechanism of resistance was saturable. Consequently, when we
increased 17-AAG concentrations by a factor of 10 over a 3-day
exposure in the resistant line SF268-RA12, HSP90 molecular
inhibition effects were restored. However, increasing 17-AAG
concentrations might have adverse effects, such as selection of
additional mechanisms of resistance or increased toxicity. Hepatotoxicity was shown to be the limiting factor for 17-AAG in phase I
clinical trials (3, 5, 32, 40, 41). Due to their quinone moiety,
alternative ansamycin benzoquinones share the same problematic
metabolism and toxic risk (39). It was not, therefore, surprising to
find cross-resistance due to reduced NQO1 with both the more
potent and water-soluble analogue 17-DMAG and also the main
active metabolite of 17-AAG in vivo, 17-AG, thus limiting the use of
these compounds as alternative therapy in 17-AAG–resistant cells.
The most appropriate strategy is probably to use structurally
unrelated HSP90 inhibitors that lack quinone moiety, and
several of them are currently in preclinical and clinical
development (2, 5). Radicicol has not been developed further
due to its lack of in vivo efficacy (42), and its derivatives are
not yet in clinical trials (43). The synthetic purine-scaffold
HSP90 inhibitor BIIB021 has entered phase I clinical trial.5 In
addition, our preclinical in vitro and in vivo data suggest that
the resorcinylic diaryl pyrazole/isoxazole amides are promising
HSP90 inhibitors with several advantages compared with 17-

AAG, including better solubility and independence from the
effects of PgP and NQO1 (29, 44). NVP-AUY922 has entered
phase I clinical trial in adults (29).5 As expected from their
lack of a quinone moiety, these compounds did not exhibit
any cross-resistance in our GB and melanoma 17-AAG–
resistant lines. Interestingly, with the same experimental
procedure used to obtain 17-AAG resistance, we have not
been able to generate any resistance to VER-50589 or NVPAUY922 over a period of exposure for up to 12 months in
either GB or melanoma lines (data not shown).
As mentioned in the Introduction, it has been suggested that the
combinatorial effects of HSP90 inhibition on multiple essential
pathways for cancer cells might suppress activation of signaling
pathways involved in drug resistance and render the probability of
cells escaping HSP90 inhibition less likely (2, 45). Unfortunately,
this theoretical advantage was compromised by the problematic
metabolism of 17-AAG but this mechanism is not relevant to the
purine and resorcinylic diaryl pyrazole/isoxazole amide inhibitors.
Concerning the potential therapeutic significance of the loss of
NQO1 expression as a possible mechanism of resistance to 17-AAG
and related agents in the clinic, it would be interesting to study the
effect of treatment on human GB stem cells.
In the majority of our 17-AAG–resistant lines, we did not observe
any cross-resistance to cytotoxic agents, even under 17-AAG pressure. This observation was in agreement with the NQO1 mechanism
of 17-AAG resistance, as none of these drugs are NQO1 substrates.
The only exception was the 17-AAG–resistant SF268-RA12 line, which
was also resistant to temozolomide. However, this cross-resistance
seemed to be due to the selection of a subline overexpressing the
DNA damage repair enzyme MGMT, which represents the most
important mechanism of cellular defense against temozolomide (46).
In conclusion, low NQO1 activity is not only a mechanism of
primary resistance (16) but also a likely mechanism of acquired
resistance to 17-AAG in GB and melanoma. This study further
highlights the problematic metabolism of GA derivatives. New
series of HSP90 inhibitors that avoid the liability of NQO1
metabolism, as exemplified by the purine and resorcinylic
pyrazole/isoxazole amide analogues, are able to avoid the
resistance due to decreased NQO1 activity, providing additional
support for the clinical development of such structurally novel
HSP90 inhibitors.

Correction: Article on In vitro Acquired Resistance to
17-AAG
In the article on in vitro acquired resistance to 17-AAG in the
March 1, 2009 issue of Cancer Research (1), there is an error in
Fig. 4; the corrected figure appears below. Also, the first sentence of
the Fig. 4 legend should read as follows: Expression of NQO1, HSP
and DNA repair proteins in the parental and 17-AAG–resistant
GB cell lines.
