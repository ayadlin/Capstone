BACKGROUND: Chemoprevention for lung cancer with nutraceutical or anti-inflammatory agents has had mixed clinical benefit. Novel
targeted agents hold the promise of greater efficacy and selectivity. The authors of this report evaluated enzastaurin, a selective protein kinase C-b (PKC-b) inhibitor with antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties, in former smokers. METHODS: The primary objective of this study was to compare the average fraction of Ki-67–stained cells (the Ki-67 labeling index [LI]) in bronchial biopsy
specimens that were collected before and after treatment. Participants were randomized (2:1) to receive either 6 months of daily oral
enzastaurin (500 mg) or placebo. Stratification was based on morphology, history of lung cancer, and airway obstruction. RESULTS:
In pretrial investigations, the rationale for PKC-b inhibition and pathway interrogation was established in premalignant lesions and
early stage lung cancer. In an intent-to-treat analysis, of 40 randomized participants, there was no significant difference in the pretreatment/post-treatment change in the Ki-67 LI between the enzastaurin group and the placebo group (P ¼ .53). Six participants
discontinued enzastaurin, including 4 participants who had adverse events, including abdominal distension, deep vein thrombosis,
hyponatremia, and rash, and 2 participants who decided to discontinue. One participant in the placebo group was discontinued on
the study because of noncompliance. Two participants had 1 serious adverse event (bradycardia, deep vein thrombosis, and hypotension). CONCLUSIONS: To the authors’ knowledge, this represents the first chemoprevention trial with a non-US Food and Drug
Administration-approved, oral, small-molecule–targeted agent. Although the primary endpoint was not met, enzastaurin was tolerable
for 6 months by 75% of participants, and there was a suggestion of response in a subset analysis that was restricted to those who

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer accounted for 1.4 million deaths world wide in 2008.1 Because of low cure rates (approximately 15%), there
is an urgent need to develop compounds that can reduce the disease incidence. The most powerful step in lung cancer prevention is avoidance of carcinogen exposure through smoking cessation. However, individuals who have smoked in the
past and have successfully quit still have a higher risk of developing lung cancer than those who are lifetime never
smokers.2
Chemoprevention, defined as the use of specific agents to reverse, suppress, or prevent the development of cancer
and a means of reducing cancer incidence and mortality, has been successful for colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and head
and neck cancer.3,4 In lung cancer, several compounds have been tested, but trials have been either negative or, in the case
of those evaluating b-carotene in smokers, deleterious.5–10 Because of the large number of required participants and long
interventions and follow-up times, trials that use lung cancer incidence as a primary endpoint pose a formidable challenge
from a logistic and financial perspective. To our knowledge, no prior lung cancer chemoprevention studies have investigated a non-US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, small-molecule–targeted agent.
To allow for testing of an increased number of promising agents over a short period, the use of surrogate endpoint
biomarkers has been explored as an alternative to cancer incidence. These include premalignancy evaluated by morphologic criteria and proliferative markers evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The best described proliferation
marker is Ki-67, which can be identified in normal and premalignant lesions of the lung. A high fraction of tumor cells
that are stained positive for Ki-67 correlates with decreased survival in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC).11,12 Enzastaurin hydrochloride is a well tolerated, minimally toxic, oral serine/threonine kinase inhibitor. Its
main biologic effect is on inhibition of the phosphorylation of proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival. Specifically, it inhibits activation of protein kinase C-b2 (PKC-b2) in vivo at doses that are achieved with single, oral daily

dosing.13–15 The role of PKC in tumorigenesis, through
its activation by tumor-promoting phorbol esters, was
first described 30 years ago16–18and, in mouse models,
studies have linked PKC to carcinogenesis.19–21 In lung
cancer cells, enzastaurin demonstrated inhibitory activity
and modulation of intracellular signaling proteins.13,21,22
In cell line and nude mouse xenograft studies, enzastaurin
treatment suppressed glycogen synthase kinase 3b
(GSK3b) phosphorylation and reduced subcutaneous tumor formation. Because of its molecular mechanism of
action and low side-effect profile, this drug is an excellent
candidate for chemoprevention in high-risk individuals.
We first assessed the expression of phosphorylated
PKC-b2 (pPKC-b2) and GSK3b (pGSK3b) in a small
cohort of individuals who had bronchial abnormalities at
a 3-month interval and in a large panel of early stage lung
cancers, and we observed that expression levels remained
stable over time and were higher in smaller tumors. Then,
we initiated a phase 2 biomarker-endpoint trial of enzastaurin versus placebo in former smokers who had metaplasia and dysplasia of the bronchoepithelium to test the
efficacy of enzastaurin as a chemopreventive agent. This
trial is registered as a national clinical trial (clinicaltrials.
gov identifier: NCT00414960.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Biomarker Evaluation in Bronchial Abnormalities
and Early Stage Lung Cancer

Metaplastic (N ¼ 18) and dysplastic (N ¼ 6) bronchoepithelial specimens were collected from a cohort of 14 individuals who were at risk for lung cancer with repeat
sampling after approximately 3 months of observation in
7 individuals, which has been described elsewhere.23 We
had also constructed a tissue microarray from 237 surgical
resection specimens from unique patients with NSCLC
that included 85 specimens from patients with stage IA
completely resected NSCLC and 102 specimens from
patients with stage IB completely resected NSCLC who
did not receive perioperative chemotherapy or radiation.24 Standard IHC and automated quantitative in situ
fluorescence-based analysis (AQUA), which allows for the
accurate and quantitative measurement of proteins in routinely processed, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) specimens, of pPKC-b2, total PKC-b2, pGSK3b,
Ki-67, and cleaved caspase 3, and digoxigenin-tagged
DNA fragments as markers of apoptosis were performed
as previously described24,25 using rabbit polyclonal antipPKC-b2, anti-pGSK3b, and anticleaved caspase 3 (catalog no. 9371, 9336, and 9661; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass), rabbit polyclonal anti-PKC-b2

(catalog no. SC-210; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, Calif), mouse monoclonal Mib1 anti-Ki-67 (catalog no. M7240; Dako, Carpenteria, Calif), and the Apoptag assay (catalog no. S7100; Chemicon, Temecula,
Calif). IHC scoring included the percentage of positively
stained tumor cells (0%-100%), with staining intensity
scores that ranged from 1 to 3 (weak, moderate, strong)
and a composite score that ranged from 0 to 300 (reflecting the percentage of positively stained cells multiplied by
the intensity score). AQUA scores ranged from 0 to 255.
Chemoprevention Study Population

This was a single-institution, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the chemopreventive effect of enzastaurin in individuals at risk
for lung cancer with a 6-month intervention and a Ki-67
biomarker endpoint (NCT00414960). The Institutional
Review Board approved the protocol, all amendments,
and the informed consent document before participant
enrollment; and the study complied with the Declaration
of Helsinki. Participants were recruited from lung cancer
databases at the Moffitt Cancer Center. The following
key inclusion criteria were used: aged 45 years, a 30
pack-year history of smoking, quit smoking 1 year
before study entry, metaplasia or dysplasia on at least 1
bronchoscopy specimen, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, negative cotinine status by urine dipstick, and adequate organ
function, including bone marrow reserve.
Key exclusion criteria included a prior history of
malignancy in the past 5 years (except nonmelanoma skin
cancer, localized prostate cancer with definitive therapy
but no history of hormone therapy, cervical carcinoma in
situ, stage I NSCLC 12 months postsurgery without
evidence of recurrence), current evidence of lung cancer,
any prior chemotherapy or hormone therapy for the purpose of cancer treatment, previous radiation to the chest
in the past 5 years, significant cardiopulmonary comorbidity, and a history of asthma that required oxygen,
inhaled steroids, or bronchodilators. The protocol and all
subsequent amendments were approved by the Institutional Review Board.
Study Design and Treatment Plan

After informed consent was obtained, eligible participants
underwent pulmonary function tests, a white light and
autofluorescence bronchoscopy with brushing at 1 site
(main carina) and biopsy of at least 3 prespecified locations (main carina, left upper lobe, and right upper lobe).
These sites where chosen because bronchial abnormalities
are most frequently discovered in these locations.

Additional sites were biopsied based on their visual
appearance. Individuals with metaplasia or dysplasia on at
least 1 of these bronchial biopsy specimens were considered eligible. Stratification was performed according to the
following criteria: history of stage I NSCLC and >12
months disease free (present vs absent), evidence of airway
obstruction (a forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced
vital capacity ratio of <0.7 vs >0.7), and pretreatment
bronchial biopsy histology (presence vs absence of dysplasia). Randomization in a 2:1 ratio of enzastaurin versus
placebo was done through a telephone registration system.
The study medication was given once daily as 4 oral
tablets (each active tablet contained 125 mg enzastaurin,
for a total of 500 mg daily) or identical-appearing placebo. During treatment, individuals were followed
bimonthly by visits to the treatment center along with
complete blood counts, metabolic panels, and 12-lead
electrocardiograms. After a 6-month treatment, a bronchoscopy with brushings and biopsies, a focused history
and physical examination, a study medication assessment,
and blood collection were performed. Adverse events
(AE) were collected using Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events version 3.0.
All biopsies were fixed in formalin, embedded in
paraffin, and stained sequentially for hematoxylin and eosin and Ki-67 (mouse monoclonal antibody Mib-1 at
1:100 dilution; Dako). The biopsies were graded according to the World Health Organization classification by a
board-certified cytopathologist who was blinded to the
treatment assignments. The number of bronchoepithelial
cells that were stained positive for Ki-67 were enumerated
and divided by the total number of cells in each specimen,
referred to as the labeling index (LI). The average Ki-67
LI for all histologic specimens collected was then calculated for each participant before and after treatment as
prespecified in the protocol. A positive Ki-67 LI prespecified response was defined as a relative decrease >50% in
the Ki-67 LI in all metaplastic/dysplastic lesions from 1
participant post-treatment versus pretreatment. The prespecified secondary biomarker endpoints included apoptosis assessment by detection of cleaved caspase 3 using
IHC (rabbit polyclonal antiserum 9661; 1:50 dilution;
Cell Signaling Technology) and downstream target inhibition by detection of pGSK3b (rabbit polyclonal antiserum 9336; 1:25 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology)
using AQUA.24,26
Statistical Methods

The primary objective was to compare the difference
between the average Ki-67 LI in all bronchial biopsy
Cancer

specimens collected before and after treatment per participant between the enzastaurin group and the placebo
group. The secondary objectives were to compare the
treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) between the enzastaurin and placebo arms in this patient population. The
prespecified exploratory objectives included assessment of
target inhibition, induction of apoptosis, and measurement of metaplasia and dysplasia by light microscopy.
The intent of the study was to enroll a total of 186
participants, which, expecting an attrition rate of approximately 25%, would allow us to evaluate 138 participants,
including 92 in the enzastaurin arm and 46 in the placebo
arm. We assumed an effect size of at least 0.51 standard
deviations for a mean change in Ki-67. With a total of
138 evaluable participants, there was 80% power for a test
at a 2-sided level of .05. An interim safety analysis was
planned after randomizing 40 individuals. A second interim analysis was planned at 50% of the information period to allow for potential sample size adjustments based
on interim results. A subsequent amendment also allowed
for an efficacy analysis after randomizing 40 individuals,
which would allow for study continuation only if profound positive results were observed in the 40 individuals.
Spearman correlations were used to assess associations between average pre-treatment and post-treatment
scores among markers. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were
used to compare scores before and after treatment
between the groups. A t test for paired data was used to
evaluate change between scores before and after treatment.
All P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.
The analyses were performed using the SAS statistical software package (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Pretrial Biomarker Evaluation in Bronchial
Abnormalities and Early Stage Lung Cancer

In premalignant bronchoepithelial specimens, pPKC-b2
was expressed in 17 of 24 (71%) specimens in 5% to
100% of cells, and the staining pattern was cytoplasmic
and homogeneous. An analysis of 7 serial specimens that
were collected approximately 3 months apart revealed no
significant change in the levels of expression (t test for
paired data). Because premalignant bronchoepithelial
specimens are a scarce resource, we used early stage lung
cancer specimens to investigate associations among
expression levels of PKC-b2, GSK3b, Ki-67, and apoptosis and relevant clinical characteristics.
We assessed PKC-b2 (Fig. 1), pPKC-b2, pGSK3b,
Ki-67, cleaved caspase 3, and digoxigenin-labeled DNA
fragment expression in tumor specimens from 187

using IHC and AQUA. The expression levels of all 6 biomarkers (Table 1) were not associated with participants’
age, sex, smoking status, performance status, or tumor histology. The median overall survival for patients who had
high pPKC-b2 expression (N ¼ 83; events, 27; censored,
56) versus low pPKC-b2 expression (N ¼ 83; events, 48;
censored, 35), analyzed by AQUA and dichotomized
using a median of 15.3, was >120 months versus 55.0
months, respectively (95% confidence interval, 34.3-75.6

significant association with overall survival. PKC-b2,
pPKC-b2, and pGSK3b expression levels were inversely
associated with tumor size; ie, small tumors were more
likely to express high levels than large tumors (Spearman

Participant Recruitment

Between December 2007 and March 2010, 1740 potential participants (of 3094 screened) were invited to participate with an introductory letter and at least 3 attempted
telephone contacts (Fig. 2). Telephone contact was established with 1184 participants (68%). Of these, 532 individuals (45%) declined, 551 (47%) were ineligible, and
101 (9%) were interested in trial participation. The main
plausible reasons for declining were transportation limitations (N ¼ 104), not wanting to ingest a non-FDAapproved medication (N ¼ 45), and not wanting to
undergo a bronchoscopy (N ¼ 16). The study closed after
completion of the interim analysis, because no major
effects were observed. In total, 40 participants were
randomized to receive 6-month treatment with either
enzastaurin (N ¼ 25) or placebo (N ¼ 15). One participant in the enzastaurin group did not receive treatment

Participant Characteristics and Drug Exposure

Of the 40 participants who were randomized, most were
Caucasian (97%), men (65%), and had a median age of
68 years (range, 52–77 years) (Table 2). Two participants
had stage I NSCLC, 3 had dysplasia, and 16 had airway
obstruction. Eighteen participants (72%) in the enzastaurin group completed the study; 1 participant never
started, and 6 discontinued treatment, 4 because of AEs
(abdominal distension, deep vein thrombosis [DVT], hyponatremia, and rash) and 2 because of participant decision. Fourteen participants (93%) in the placebo group
completed the study; 1 participant discontinued because
of noncompliance.
Of 39 participants who received treatment, the
mean duration of drug exposure was 165 days (range, 21–

199 days), and the mean dose was 476 mg daily (range,
331–554 mg daily) (Table 3). All 39 participants who
received treatment used at least 50% of the prescriptions
and were considered treatment compliant. Three participants in the enzastaurin group had dose reductions
because of lower extremity edema, diarrhea, or QT prolongation on an electrocardiogram.
Morphologic Assessment

Thirty-four participants underwent 2 bronchoscopies,
and 6 underwent 1 bronchoscopy with biopsies of at least
3 prespecified sites. Of the total 254 specimens collected,
normal histology was revealed in 52 specimens, 153 presented metaplasia, 6 presented dysplasia, and 43 were
insufficient for morphologic assessment. All 3 participants
1027

Original Article

who had dysplasia before therapy (in 1 of 3 biopsy specimens) were randomized to the enzastaurin arm and had
metaplasia identified on the second biopsy. One participant in the placebo group and 2 participants in the enzastaurin group had dysplasia (in 1 of 3 biopsy specimens) at
the end of the study.
Ki-67 Analysis

The primary analysis was performed on 2 populations:
the intent-to-treat population (Fig. 3A) and the efficacy
population (Ki-67 LI measurements from biopsy specimens before and after treatment). For the efficacy population (N ¼ 34), both arms had an increase in the mean Ki67 LI at the end of the study (pretreatment to post-treatment Ki-67 LI: enzastaurin, 6.7 to 10.4, respectively [P ¼
.16]; placebo, 4.0 to 10.1, respectively [P ¼ .07]), and the
changes between both groups were statistically insignificant. In the enzastaurin group, 6 of 21 participants had a
decreased Ki-67 LI after treatment (greatest mean change,
27.7%); in the placebo group, 4 of 13 participants had a
decreased Ki-67 LI after treatment (greatest mean change,
4.5%). The mean Ki-67 LI change did not differ significantly between the 2 arms (mean difference, 2.4; 95%
confidence interval, 10.6 to 5.8; P ¼ .56). Similar
results were observed for the intent-to-treat population,
and the differences were insignificant (P ¼ .53) between
both groups.
In analyses that were conducted using only the
abnormal specimens (metaplasia or dysplasia; N ¼ 159
[ie, specimens with normal histology were ignored in the
analysis]), we observed a similar pattern of results (Fig.
3B, C). Both arms had numerically increased mean Ki-67
values after treatment, and the enzastaurin arm had a
numerically smaller increase than the placebo arm. No
statistically significant results were observed between or
within treatment comparisons. In the enzastaurin group,
4 of 21 participants (19%) had a 50% relative decrease
in Ki-67 LI in all metaplasia or dysplasia lesions after
treatment compared with 0 of 12 participants in the placebo group. However, this difference in the response rate
was not statistically significant (P ¼ .27).
Adverse Events

One participant in the enzastaurin group, who had a prior
history of DVT and was receiving conjugated estrogen,
had 2 DVT events (grade 3) possibly related to study drug
and had a full recovery. Another participant who was
receiving enzastaurin had 2 nonstudy drug-related AEs—
bradycardia (grade 3) and hypotension (grade 3)—after
accidentally ingesting the spouse’s hypertension medication. Severe AEs were not reported in the placebo group.

individuals had a reduction in Ki-67, but this did not meet
response criteria, ie, a relative change 50%. One individual
who had metaplasia at baseline failed Ki-67 staining and,
thus, was excluded from the analysis of abnormal specimens.

observed between pGSK3b and Ki-67.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study represents the first lung cancer chemoprevention trial with a non-FDA-approved,
oral, small-molecule–targeted agent. In the intent-to-treat
population, the study failed to meet the primary endpoint. There was no significant difference in the change of
the Ki-67 LI between the enzastaurin group and the placebo group. A within-group comparison of the pre-treatment and post-treatment samples did not reveal a
statistically significant difference. However, in an analysis
that was restricted to metaplastic and dysplastic samples
only, 19% of participants who were receiving enzastaurin
had a reduction >50% in Ki-67 response compared with
0% of those who were receiving placebo.
Studies by Graff et al have demonstrated an up to
90% reduction of pGSK3b in nude mouse xenografts for
up to 8 hours after oral enzastaurin dosing and an effect
loss after 12 hours.22 At clinically achievable plasma levels,
enzastaurin directly interferes with the phosphorylation of
several molecules of key importance in carcinogenesis and
tumor progression, including protein kinase B (Akt),
GSK3b, ribosomal protein S6K, and the transcription
factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding); and it
has been demonstrated that enzastaurin inhibits migration, metastases, and invasion of NSCLC cells in vivo.27
In addition, our pretrial investigations of PKC-b2,
pPKC-b2, and pGSK3b suggested that active signal transduction through PKC-b2 may be more frequent in early
stage lung cancer, thus also suggesting its biologic importance in early tumorigenesis. Given the crucial position of
PKC-b2 in the regulation of cell growth and survival, the
frequent expression of a seemingly intact PKC-b2/GSK3
signal transduction in early stage NSCLC, and the vanishingly low toxicity of the oral PKC inhibitor enzastaurin,28
a phase 2 chemoprevention study in former smokers was
initiated.
To assess for target inhibition, pre-treatment and
post-treatment tissue specimens were analyzed, and the
expected reduction in GSK3b phosphorylation and
increase in cleaved caspase 3 were not apparent. This lack
of a pharmacodynamic response indicates that apoptosis
and antiproliferative effects were not achieved uniformly,
thus likely explaining the improved, yet nonsignificant,
responses in Ki-67 LI in a limited population—in the
abnormal samples only and not across all samples. Drug
concentrations may have played a role is these findings.
Still, previous data suggest that the prescribed dose of
1030

enzastaurin is effective in reducing tissue levels of
pGSK3b, and our results also may be explained by the
time elapsed from last dosing to tissue collection, which
was 24 hours or greater in all but 2 participants. It is noteworthy that the largest reduction in GSK3b phosphorylation was observed in a participant who received
enzastaurin within 8 hours of biopsy. This participant also
had the largest relative reduction in Ki-67 LI (76%) and
also had a 50% increase in the cleaved caspase 3 score.
The study design did not specify the precise temporal relation between last dosing and post-treatment biopsy,
which future studies should keep in mind, because it is
possible that a biologic rebound may obscure a true pharmacodynamic effect. Although the timing of post-treatment biopsies will have to vary from agent to agent, it is
imperative to consider the pharmacokinetic characteristics
of the specific agent as well as the stability of the specific
biomarker to have a true pharmacodynamic assessment.
Another factor that may have played a role in the
lack of significant findings includes the possibility that
drug concentrations in the current study may not have
been high enough to lead to antiproliferative effects in tissues with lower proliferation rates. Our observed reduction in Ki-67 in morphologically abnormal specimens in
the enzastaurin group compared with the placebo group
suggests that tissues with low proliferation may not be
suitable for efficacy evaluation of antiproliferative agents.
This was observed previously in a similar trial that compared celecoxib with placebo in former smokers. Those
investigators reported that specimens with high pretreatment proliferation rates (Ki-67 LI: 2 vs < 2) were more
likely to demonstrate reductions post-treatment than
those with low pretreatment proliferation rates.29 It is
noteworthy that, in our intent-to-treat population, the
Ki-67 LI increased in the enzastaurin and placebo groups,
although not at a statistically significant rate. These findings, although not previously described in the recently
reported trials of celecoxib or iloprost,10,30 may be
because of outside events that can influence levels of Ki67.30,31 Furthermore, Ki-67 alone may not be sufficiently
specific or sensitive for predicting future lung cancer
development.31,32
In this study, we were able to establish a recruitment
algorithm and to quantify the participant attrition (nearly
99%) for future chemoprevention trials by focusing on a
population at risk that had prior familiarity with clinical
investigations. We demonstrated that once-daily oral
enzastaurin was generally well tolerated and that serial Ki67 assessments in former smokers were feasible. The biomarker assessments for target inhibition performed in the

treatment and placebo groups allowed us to document the
natural history of bronchial airway changes in this patient
population.
Although our results are clearly affected by the small
sample size and do not afford the opportunity to evaluate
the potential effects of enzastaurin on the prevention of
peripheral lung carcinomas, our accrual rates and histology results in former smokers are comparable to previously published chemoprevention trials. In 2010, Kim et
al30 published a celecoxib lung cancer chemoprevention
study, which accrued a total of 53 former smokers and
162 current smokers who had normal, metaplastic, or dysplastic changes in their bronchial epithelium during a
recruitment period just short of 5 years. In a population in
which no minimum bronchial airway changes were
required, the metaplasia or dysplasia rate was 5.7% (14 of
248 samples) in material obtained from former smokers.
We were able to accrue 40 former smokers during a
recruitment period of 2.3 years with a minimum requirement of metaplasia, resulting in a higher metaplasia/dysplasia rate of 62% (157 of 254 samples). In 2011, Keith et
al published the results from their 6-year phase 2 study of
iloprost versus placebo which accrued 71 former smokers
and 81 current smokers who met 1 of following criteria:
1) sputum atypia (30% of former smokers) or 2) bronchial dysplasia. Compared with those studies, in the current study, we used stricter inclusion criteria, such as a
30 pack-year history of smoking and a minimum
requirement of metaplasia on bronchial samples, to allow
the inclusion of only those who had histologic evidence of
airway changes. Despite these additional restrictions, participants were successfully accrued. Although cross-trial
comparisons carry inherent limitations, it is noteworthy
that many similarities in accrual achievements can be
observed among these trials. A clear recruitment plan,
infrastructure, resources, and experience, and dedication
of the investigative team are paramount for a successful
accrual to lung cancer chemoprevention trials.
The current findings argue against the further investigation of enzastaurin as a lung cancer chemopreventive
agent. Although smoking cessation clearly can reduce
lung cancer risk, former smokers represent a large population at risk of developing lung cancer. Hence, there exists
the potential for added benefit from a proven chemoprevention agent. For progress to be made in lung cancer chemoprevention, advanced preclinical risk models that
better delineate the mechanisms of actions are encouraged. Future trials must include biomarker assessments to
afford pharmacodynamic and mechanistic insight into
agent activity. Our results highlight the required detail

and logistics necessary to optimize the informative value
of chosen biomarkers. We conclude that further studies
with enzastaurin or similar agents must collect post-treatment specimens while accounting for agent-specific pharmacokinetic and biomarker dynamics and documenting
the time interval between last dosing and specimen collection. We further conclude that Ki-67 or other biomarkers
of proliferation should be used only in tissues with high
baseline levels, such as metaplastic/dysplastic lesions, if
the inhibitory activity of an agent is being investigated.
Further studies with enzastaurin or similar agents that
take these considerations into account are warranted to
advance cancer prevention with targeted agents.
