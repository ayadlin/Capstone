ABSTRACT
One of the requirements for tumor development is blood supply, most often
driven by hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. Hypoxia induces the stabilization of hypoxiainducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), which induces expression of an angiogenic factor,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The purpose of this study is to validate a
new screening platform combined with orthogonal assays to rapidly identify HIF-1
inhibitors and to evaluate the effectiveness of approved drugs on modulating HIF-1
signaling.
We generated an endogenous HIF-1α–NanoLuc luciferase reporter allele in the
human HCT116 colon cancer cell line using genome editing and screened a panel
of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to 960 druggable targets and approximately
2,500 drugs on a quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platform. Selected
compounds were further investigated with secondary assays to confirm their anti-HIF
activity and to study their mode of action. The qHTS assay identified over 300 drugs
that inhibited HIF-1α-NanoLuc expression. The siRNA screening results supported
the effectiveness of several target-specific inhibitors. Moreover, the identified HIF-1
inhibitors, such as mycophenolate mofetil, niclosamide, and trametinib, were able
to suppress cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Our study indicates that
blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) pathways effectively inhibits hypoxia-induced HIF-1α accumulation and
HIF-1α transactivation and that proteasome inhibitors induce accumulation and
decrease transcriptional activity of HIF-1α. These findings underline the importance
of developing a battery of robust assay platforms and confirmation studies that focus
on endogenous protein targets so that only relevant and reliable data will be taken
into pre-clinical and clinical studies.

INTRODUCTION

increased expression of HIF-1 target genes, including
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other
angiogenic genes, results in blood vessel formation and
tumor expansion. Thus, HIF-1α is a potential target for
inhibition of both tumor-mediated angiogenesis and
other aspects of tumor development, such as metabolic
alterations that further increase the proliferation of tumor
cells. Based on mechanism of action, HIF- 1α inhibitors
can be categorized into inhibitors of HIF- 1– DNA- binding

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) have a crucial
role in cancer development, progression, and metastasis
[1]. As a tumor develops, the escalating number of cells
increases the rate of oxygen consumption at the tumor
site and creates hypoxic stress. Hypoxia results in the
stabilization of the labile HIF-1 subunit HIF-1α and
the induction of HIF-1 target gene transcription. The

activity, inhibitors of HIF1A messenger RNA (mRNA)
expression, inhibitors of HIF-1α protein translation,
inhibitors of HIF-1α transcriptional activity, and activators
of the prolyl-hydroxylase-driven HIF-1α degradation
pathway [2]. Over 20 HIF- 1 inhibitors, including topotecan
(Hycamtin), vorinostat (Zolinza) and YC-1, which are
approved anti-cancer drugs, have been tested in clinical
trials, or are being investigated in pre-clinical studies [3].
The translation of pre-clinical research findings
to clinical research, particularly to oncology drug
development, is challenging owing to the highly dynamic
and heterogeneous nature of cancer cells [4]. The
generation of reliable data requires physiologically relevant
in vitro and in vivo models, robust assay technologies,
and well-executed confirmation and validation studies.
Clinically approved drugs and investigational drugs are
increasingly being assessed for their anticancer properties
primarily because these compounds have already been
tested for toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and drug-drug
interactions. Thus, there is a need to develop a robust,
reliable, physiologically relevant, and high-throughput
screening (HTS)-compatible platform that can assess the
effects of drugs on endogenous targets. HTS is a popular
route for drug discovery, drug development, and target
identification. Quantitative HTS (qHTS), a titration-based
approach that tests multiple compound concentrations, is
capable of generating concentration-response curves for
thousands of compounds measured in a single experiment
[5], greatly reducing false positive and false negative
rates [6]. Robust statistical methods and secondary
assay strategies can be employed to further improve data
reliability.
Current technologies for high-throughput and
high-content screening often involve the use of target

proteins that are not expressed from their endogenous
promoters and the use of surrogate markers of activity,
both approaches can yield non-physiological results.
However, using a recombinant adeno-associated virus
(rAAV) genome editing platform, one can precisely
knock a reporter gene into an allele of interest, permitting
evaluation of genes and proteins at physiologically
relevant levels. Nano Luciferase (NanoLuc) is a small
(<  20 kDa), bright (> 150-fold of firefly luciferase)
reporter with glow-type luminescence (approximate
half-life: 120 minutes) [7] that can be used to accurately
measure low levels of protein expression from endogenous
promoters. In this study, we have used rAAV genome
editing technology to generate a HCT116 human colon
cancer HIF-1α–NanoLuc reporter cell line. This reporter
cell line was used in a qHTS platform to evaluate the
effect of 2,457 clinically-used and investigational drugs
in the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) [8] on
hypoxia-induced HIF-1α–NanoLuc protein accumulation.

RESULTS
Identification of HIF-1 inhibitors using a qHTS
platform
The HIF-1α–NanoLuc reporter cell line was
generated using rAAV-mediated genome editing
technology to introduce a NanoLuc reporter sequence
downstream of and in frame with the last coding exon of
the HIF1A gene (Figure 1A). The function of this reporter
cell line was validated in 96-well and 1536-well formats
using known factors such as low oxygen concentration
and HIF-1 modulators that alter hypoxia signaling
(Figure 1 and Figure S1). Under hypoxic conditions the

relative luminescence unit (RLU) values measured from
the HIF- 1α-NanoLuc reporter were proportional to the
HIF- 1α-NanoLuc protein levels measured by western
blotting (Figure S1B). These initial experiments indicated
that treatment for 18 hours with topotecan under hypoxic
condition robustly and consistently reduced hypoxiainduced HIF-1α–NanoLuc expression with a Z’ factor
value of 0.58, while a 6-hour incubation yielded a lower Z’
factor of 0.38. Thus, topotecan as the positive control and
an 18-hour incubation time in a hypoxic (1% O2) chamber
were selected for the qHTS of HIF-1 inhibitors.
The HIF-1α–NanoLuc assay was used to
identify potential HIF-1α inhibitors from the NCATS
Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC), which contains
clinically-approved and investigational drugs. The average
signal-to-background (S/B) ratio, coefficient of variation
(CV) value, and Z’ factor from the primary screen of
20 assay plates were 3.4, 6%, and 0.66 respectively. Three
hundred and five compounds decreased hypoxia-induced
HIF-1α–NanoLuc expression in HCT116 cells after
18 hours of compound treatment. Twenty-two compounds
previously reported as HIF-1 inhibitors were identified from
our HIF-1α–NanoLuc screen (Table S1). Anthracycline
chemotherapeutic agents, anti-metabolic nucleobase
analogs, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers,
cardiac glycosides, and quinolone chemotherapeutic were
identified as HIF-1α–NanoLuc inhibitors. Moreover the
HIF-1α–NanoLuc assay identified several pharmacological
inhibitors that target the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK and
PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling pathways (Table S2).

signaling pathway, are potential modulators of HIF1α–NanoLuc activity (Table S3). The top disease and
biological function networks identified from the siRNA
screen that affected HIF-1α–NanoLuc activity include posttranscriptional modification, post-translational modification,
protein degradation, and cancer associated networks (Table
S4). Consistent with the findings from an independent
study that reported an siRNA screen in melanoma cells
[9], our results revealed that silencing of the three DNA
damage response (DDR) factors—ATM, checkpoint
kinase 1 (CHEK1) and checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2)—
led to altered HIF-1α-NanoLuc expression levels under
hypoxic conditions and the three genes are involved in
several signaling pathways and networks identified by the
siRNA screen (Table S3 and S4). The siRNA screen also
identified siRNAs that resulted in increased activity of HIF1α–NanoLuc under hypoxic conditions, such as siRNAs
targeting sirtuins (SIRTs) and fms-related typrosine kinase
1 (FLT1) (Table S5). The HIF-1α–NanoLuc activity was
significantly down-regulated by siRNAs targeting fibroblast
growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and phosphoglycerate
kinase 1 (PGK1) (Table S6).

Confirmation of identified HIF-1 inhibitors
From the primary screen, 40 HIF-1α–NanoLuc
inhibitors selected based on potency (≤ 10 uM), efficacy
(≥ 50%), goodness of curve fit (curve class of −1.1, −1.2,
−2.1, and −2.2) (Figure S2), or biological interest, were retested in the HIF-1α–NanoLuc HCT116 cells and counter
screened in the hypoxia response element-beta-lactamase
(HRE–bla) reporter gene assay [6] to eliminate potential
assay artifacts caused by non-specific interactions or
compound cytotoxicity (Table 1 and Table S7). All of the
40 HIF-1α–NanoLuc inhibitors reduced HIF-1α–NanoLuc
levels in a concentration-dependent manner and 37 of these
compounds (93%) also decreased HRE–bla transactivation
activity (Table S7). Cardiac glycosides and other inhibitors
of transcription or translation such as actinomycin and
cycloheximide suppressed hypoxia-induced HIF-1α–
NanoLuc expression with sub-micromolar potency (Figure
2B and Table S7). The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib
and carfilzomib, which potently induced accumulation of
HIF-1α–NanoLuc proteins in the HCT116 cells, inhibited
the transcriptional activity of HRE–bla in the ME-180
cells (Figure S3).
A subset of 36 small molecule inhibitors that
target the same regulators identified from the drug and
siRNA screens were tested in the HIF-1α–NanoLuc
assay to validate their effect on pathway inhibition. The
topoisomerase inhibitor —camptothecin— was at least
three-fold more potent than other topoisomerase inhibitors
tested in our assays (Figure 2C). Nucleoside analogs
such as 5-azacitidine, alexidine, and 6-thioguanine were
confirmed to decrease HIF-1α–NanoLuc levels and HRE–
bla transactivation activity (Figure 2D and Table S7).

Identification of drug targets using an siRNA
screen
To identify drug targets that are related to HIF-1
signaling pathway, the HIF-1α–NanoLuc reporter cell line
was used to screen a 960 siRNA druggable target library
under hypoxic conditions. Down-regulation of mRNAs in
the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathways, including RAF1,
MAP2K1, MAP2K2, MAPK3 and MKNK2, resulted in
decreased hypoxia-induced HIF-1α–NanoLuc reporter
gene expression (Figure 2A and Table S2). siRNAs
targeting RAF1 and MAP2K1 were the most effective with
more than 80% efficacy, whereas inhibition by siRNAs
targeting MAP2K2 and MKNK1 had no effect on HIF-1α–
NanoLuc activity. siRNAs that targeted components of the
PI3K–AKT–mTOR and PKC pathways also inhibited HIF1α–NanoLuc activity under hypoxic conditions (Figure 2A
and Table S2). A substantial inhibitory effect was mediated
by a siRNAs targeting PIK3C2A. Silencing of insulin-like
growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) also resulted in decreased
in HIF-1α–NanoLuc activity (Figure 2A and Table S2).
The siRNA screen data also indicated that a
number of canonical pathways, including the pyrimidine
ribonucleotide salvage pathways, the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate
salvage pathway, and the nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kB)

In addition to RAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors
identified from the primary screen, two more RAF
inhibitors (TAK632 and vemurafenib), a new MEK
inhibitor (trametinib), and an ERK inhibitor (GDC- 0994),
were identified as HIF-1α inhibitors (Figure 2E and
Table S2). To further support the anti-HIF activity of PI3K
pathway inhibitors, three more PI3K inhibitors—PI-103,
wortmannin, and LY294002, an additional AKT inhibitor
AZD5363, and two more mTOR inhibitors—PI-103 and
temsirolimus— were tested in the confirmatory screen

compounds suppressed proliferation of ME-180 cells
and 15 of these compounds reduced the viability of
HCT116 by > 50% after three days of treatment (Table 1
and Table S8). Proscillaridin A, ouabain, and trametinib
were the most potent compounds identified from the
HCT116 viability screen, whereas all cardiac glycosides,
camptothecin, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, PI-103,

in ME-180 cells at submicromolar IC50 concentrations
(Table 1 and Table S8).

an angiogenesis inhibitor control, sunitinib, were tested
for their ability to inhibit angiogenesis in an in vitro coculture assay system (Table 1 and Figure 4). After a threeday exposure of test compounds, all compounds were
able to completely block angiogenesis in the co-culture
assay. Trametinib was the most potent angiogenesis
inhibitor with a picomolar IC50 value. Mycophenolate

cytotoxicity at high concentrations, niclosamide inhibited
tube formation with an IC50 value of 0.04 ± 0.03  µM.
It is very interesting to find that the identified HIF- 1
inhibitors were 2.7-fold to 59,600-fold more potent in
preventing arotic endothelial cells from forming tubular
structures than inhibiting HIF-1α–NanoLuc accumulation
in HCT116 cells.

assay and gene expression changes were analyzed using
a panel of 84 genes involved in human hypoxia signaling
(Figure 5). The gene panel consists of HIF1A, cotranscription factors of HIF-1, other HIF-1 interacting
proteins, and hypoxia responsive genes that regulate
angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation, coagulation,
DNA damage and repair, metabolism, and transcription.
Seventy-one out of 84 genes, including annexin A2
(ANXA2) and vascular endothelial growth factor A
(VEGFA), were significantly upregulated in ME-180
cells by hypoxia. As shown in Figure 5A, the four
HIF-1α–NanoLuc inhibitors were able to suppress the
expression of the majority of the hypoxia-induced genes
in the gene panel. A closer look at the sub gene sets
revealed that the four compounds induced similar gene
expression changes in angiogenesis and cell proliferation
(Figure 5B).

Effect of HIF-1α inhibitors on the expression of
hypoxia-targeted genes
In order to further study how the identified HIF1α–NanoLuc inhibitors affect hypoxia signaling, ME180 cells were exposed to hypoxia and treated with

DISCUSSION

rather than by inducing DNA replication-introduced DNA
damage or by inhibiting proteasome-mediated protein
degradation [19]. Mitoxantrone can reduce HIF-1α levels
in topoisomerase II-deficient HCT116 cells, probably
through non-selective inhibition of protein translation
[20]. In our study, topoisomerase inhibitors (camptothecin,
daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, and topotecan) were more
potent at blocking HIF-1α transactivation in ME-180
cells (IC50: 0.20–1.00 µM) than reducing the levels of the
HIF-1α–NanoLuc protein in HCT116 cells (IC50 = 0.57–
7.65 µM) (Table 1). In agreement with these findings, the
topoisomerase inhibitors were more effective at inhibiting
proliferation of the ME-180 cells (IC50: 0.04–0.17 µM)
than the HCT116 cells (IC50 = 1.00–11.10 µM), a finding
supported by a moderate correlation (R2  > 0.5) between
anti-HIF activity and cancer cell viability. Moreover,
camptothecin, mitoxantrone, and topotecan were
2100−, 1900−, and 210-fold more potent in inhibiting
angiogenesis than HIF-1α–NanoLuc activity (Table 1).
These results imply that HIF-1 inhibition might be one of
the mechanisms through which topoisomerase inhibitors
suppress cancer growth and angiogenesis. Future work
should investigate the effectiveness of topoisomerasedependent and -independent regulation of HIF-1 signaling
on cancer proliferation and angiogenesis.
The anti-proliferative activity of MAPK pathway
inhibitors was highly associated with compound potency
in suppressing hypoxia-induced HIF-1α–NanoLuc protein
accumulation. The RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK signaling
cascade is a master regulator of HIF-1 signaling [21]
in which HIF-1 transcription activity is promoted by

Using an endogenous HIF-1α protein reporter assay,
we have screened approximately 2,500 drugs and 960
siRNAs to druggable targets for their ability to modulate
endogenous HIF-1α protein levels. The HCT116 cell
line expressing an endogenous HIF-1α–NanoLuc fusion
protein showed a robust response to factors known to
modulate HIF-1 activity, including hypoxia, normoxia,
hypoxia mimetic compounds (such as cobalt chloride and
1, 10-phenathroline) [10], HIF-1 inhibitors (such as cardiac
glycosides, topoisomerase inhibitors, PI3K pathway
inhibitors, and MAPK pathway inhibitors) [6, 11–13],
siRNAs of HIF-1 regulators (such as targets in PI3K and
MAPK pathways) [14], inhibitors of transcription (such
as actinomycin) [15], inhibitors of translation (such as
cycloheximide) [16], and proteasome inhibitors (such as
bortezomib and carfilzomib) [17]. The paradoxical action
of the two proteasome inhibitors to both increase HIF1α–NanoLuc expression and inhibit HRE–bla activity
(Figure S3) is consistent with a previous report that
bortezomib could induce accumulation of HIF-1α proteins
by proteasome inhibition, but inhibit HIF-1 transactivation
activity by interacting with the C-terminal transactivation
domain of HIF-1α [18].
Topoisomerase inhibitors are known to block
HIF-1 signaling through multiple modes of action
and exerted anti-proliferative effects on HCT116 and
ME- 180 cells in our study and other studies. For example,
topotecan has been shown to affect HIF-1α dynamics and
transcriptional activity by blocking HIF-1α translation

screening of the hypoxic HIF-1α–NanoLuc reporter
cells revealed that RAF, MEK, ERK, MNK, and IGFR
act upstream of HIF1A, and that inhibition of MAP2K1
decreased reporter activity the most (Figure 2A).
Interestingly, the three identified MEK inhibitors—
PD-184352, selumetinib, and trametinib — exhibited
distinct activities against HIF-1 signaling and cancer cell
proliferation. PD-184352 and trametinib inhibited HIF-1
activity in both HIF-1α–NanoLuc HCT116 and HRE–bla
ME-180 assays; however, selmetinib reduced the levels
of HIF-1α–NanoLuc but did not decrease HRE–bla
transactivation activity (Table 1 and Table S8). Trametinib
reduced HCT116 and ME-180 cell viability by half at
submicromolar concentrations, whereas PD- 184352 and
selumetinib required higher concentrations to achieve
the same anti-proliferative effects on HCT116 cells
(Table 1 and Table S2). Trametinib and selumetinib were
approximately 60,000-fold and 150-fold more potent in
blocking tube formation in an angiogenesis co-culture
assay than in inhibiting HIF-1α–NanoLuc activity
(Table 1). The gene expression profiling data showed that
trametinib decreased expression levels of HIF1A and many
hypoxia responsive genes in ME-180 cells (Figure 5B). In
addition to MEK and HIF-1, there may have been other
important targets and pathways that contribute to the subnanomolar anti-angiogenic activity of trametinib.
The cytotoxicity of PI3K pathway inhibitors in
ME-180 cancer cells correlated well with their anti-HIF
activity. Cells treated with inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR
or transiently transfected with dominant negative AKT
or PI3K have been reported to inhibit HIF-1α expression
in human prostate cancer cell lines [24]. Our results
show that the anti-HIF-1 activities of the PI3K pathway
inhibitors measured by both HIF-1α–NanoLuc and
HRE– bla assays correlated well (R2 > 0.75) with their
effects on the viability of ME-180 cells (Table 1, Table S7,
and Table S8). Moreover, siRNAs targeting PIK3C or
PIK3R genes reduced HIF-1α–NanoLuc expression levels
more than siRNAs targeting AKT or FRAP (Figure 2A).
The results also suggested that PI3K pathway inhibitors
modulate HIF-1 signaling by altering protein levels and
transactivation activity of endogenous HIF-1α proteins.
PI-103, the most potent novel HIF-1 inhibitor among the
PI3K pathway inhibitors tested in this study, is a dual
PI3K and mTOR inhibitor with anti-proliferative activity
in leukemia [25], hepatocellular carcinoma [26], and
glioma [27] cells. Unexpectedly, the mTOR inhibitor PP242 and the two PI3K inhibitors PI- 103 and LY294002
exhibited a time-dependent increase in cytotoxicity to
ME- 180 cells yet had no apparent anti-proliferative effects
on HCT116 cells that had been continuously exposed to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these compounds for three days. PI-103 and PP-242
exhibited similar potencies in their ability to inhibit HIF1α–NanoLuc activity and block endothelial cell tube
formation (Table 1). Consistent with the cell proliferation
and angiogenesis assay data, PI-103 decreased the
expression levels of all hypoxia-induced genes tested
(Figure 5B).
The HIF-1α–NanoLuc assay identified several
novel HIF-1 inhibitors including approved drugs such as
mycophenolate mofetil and niclosamide. Mycophenolate
mofetil, a prodrug of mycophenolic acid which was
known to inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase
(IMPDH), was used as an immunosuppressant in the clinic
owing to its effects on purine synthesis [28]. Despite the
fact that mycophenolate mofetil showed unsuccessful antitumor effects in vivo, this drug was reported to strongly
inhibit VEGF secretion and angiogenesis in many cancer
cell lines [29–31]. The anthelmintic drug niclosamide
was recently discovered to have anti-cancer activities in
colon cancer [32], lung cancer [33], breast cancer [34],
and castration-resistant prostate cancer [35]. Niclosamide
was reported to inhibit signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) [36], an upstream regulator of
HIF-1 and VEGF signaling [37]. Our results show that
both mycophenolate mofetil and niclosamide inhibit HIF1α–NanoLuc accumulation and HRE–bla transactivation
at similar potencies (Table 1). Mycophenolate mofetil
selectively attenuated the viability of ME-180 cells and
angiogenesis in the endothelial cell–mesenchymal stem
cell co-cultures. Niclosamide was cytotoxic to HCT116
and ME-180 cells at low micromolar concentrations and
anti-angiogenic at concentrations that were moderately
cytotoxic. While both mycophenolate mofetil and
niclosamide were able to reverse hypoxia-induced gene
expression, mycophenolate mofetil was more similar
to PI-103 and trametinib in modulating genes, such as
hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) and nitric
oxide synthase (NOS3) (Figure 5).
In summary, the present study systematically
evaluated approved drugs, investigational drugs, and
inhibition of druggable targets on HIF-1 signaling.
Because HIF-1 regulates a wide variety of target genes
required for angiogenesis, survival, metastasis, and glucose
metabolism in cancer cells [21], it is important to explore
whether existing anti-cancer agents could suppress tumor
growth via HIF-1 inhibition, what approved drugs can be
repurposed for anti-cancer drug development, and what
upstream regulators will be most effective for modulating
HIF-1 activity. As many of the potential regulators of HIF1 have not known as the pharmacological modulators yet,
there is a need to develop new therapeutic agents for these
regulators. Due to the diverse, unexplored mechanisms
of the HIF-1 inhibitors identified from this screen, it is
necessary to further test various drug combinations in the
same HIF-1 assays and follow-up studies for their in vivo
anti-tumor activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 300 μg/mL
G418. Cells were seeded in white 96−, 384−, or 1536−
well white solid bottom plates. After compound treatment
under normoxic (20% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions,
NanoLuc luciferase activity was measured using Nano-Glo
reagent according manufacturer’s instruction. For qHTS,
cells at 1500 cells/well in 1536-well plates were incubated
with test compounds at 37ºC, 5% CO2, 1% O2 for 18 hours
in a humidified CO2 incubator with variable oxygen control,
followed by addition of Nano-Glo reagent or CellTiterGlo cell viability assay reagent. The luminescence signals
were collected on a ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer).
Analysis of compound concentration-response data
and compound activity assignment was performed as
previously described [5, 39]. For siRNA screening, cells
in 384-well plates were reversely transfected with 20 nM
siRNA duplexes from libraries of druggable targets (GE
Dhamacon) using RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) and
incubated for 42 hours prior to hypoxic conditions (1% O2)
for six hours. The luciferase activity was quantified using
Nano-Glo reagent and a FLUOstar OMEAGA plate reader
(BMG Labtech). Screening analysis and quality control
of the siRNA screening was conducted using KNIME
(University of Konstanz) and Spotfire (TIBCO Software).
The gene and pathway annotation was analyzed by
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (QIAGEN).

HRE-bla reporter gene assay

Construction of X-MAN® HIF-1α–NanoLuc
reporter cell line

Cell culture of HRE–bla ME-180 cells (Cat.
No. K1644, Life Technologies) and HRE–bla assay
were conducted according to a reported protocol [6].
Briefly, HRE–bla cells were seeded in 1536-well black
clear bottom plates (Greiner Bio One) and treated with
test compounds at 37ºC, 5% CO2, 1% O2 for 18 hours,
followed by addition of a beta-lactamase substrate CCF4
and CellTiter-Glo reagent. The fluorescence signals
(460/25 nm and 530/20 nm) of CCF4 and luminescence
signals of CellTiter-Glo were acquired on an Envision and
a ViewLux plate readers (Perkin Elmer), respectively.

HCT116 cells, with a single allele of HIF1A
endogenously tagged with a NanoLuc (Promega) reporter
fusion, were generated using rAAV technologies, as
previously described [38]. Briefly, a rAAV targeting
vector with terminal viral inverted terminal repeat (ITR)
sequences was synthesized using two regions of homology
to the HIF1A endogenous locus and a floxed antibiotic
selection marker. The 3′ homology region contained a
linker sequence, followed by the NanoLuc open reading
frame (ORF), immediately upstream of the endogenous
STOP codon of HIF1A transcript ENST00000337138.
After infection with the rAAV virus, antibiotic selection,
and low density plate-out, clonal populations of targeted
cells were selected and validated by PCR and Sanger
sequencing to ensure populations were targeted at the
correct locus and no off-target integrations of the targeting
vector had occurred. Finally, Cre-recombinase was used
to remove the selection cassette leaving a single LoxP
sequence between the two regions of homology.

Cancer cell proliferation assay
HCT116 and ME-180 cells (ATCC) were cultured
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were
seeded in 1536-well plates and treated with test
compounds at 11 concentrations for 24, 48, and 72 hours
at 37ºC, 5% CO2. Cell proliferation was quantified as
relative luminescence unit (RLU) values using CellTiterGlo viability assay reagent on a ViewLux plate reader
(Perkin Elmer).
