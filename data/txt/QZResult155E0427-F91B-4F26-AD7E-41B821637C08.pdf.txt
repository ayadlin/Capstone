ABSTRACT
Antibodies that target cell-surface molecules on T cells can enhance anti-tumor
immune responses, resulting in sustained immune-mediated control of cancer. We
set out to find new cancer immunotherapy targets by phenotypic screening on human
regulatory T (Treg) cells and report the discovery of novel activators of tumor necrosis
factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) and a potential role for this target in immunotherapy. A
diverse phage display library was screened to find antibody mimetics with preferential
binding to Treg cells, the most Treg-selective of which were all, without exception,
found to bind specifically to TNFR2. A subset of these TNFR2 binders were found to
agonise the receptor, inducing iκ-B degradation and NF-κB pathway signalling in vitro.
TNFR2 was found to be expressed by tumor-infiltrating Treg cells, and to a lesser
extent Teff cells, from three lung cancer patients, and a similar pattern was also
observed in mice implanted with CT26 syngeneic tumors. In such animals, TNFR2specific agonists inhibited tumor growth, enhanced tumor infiltration by CD8+ T cells
and increased CD8+ T cell IFN-γ synthesis. Together, these data indicate a novel
mechanism for TNF-α-independent TNFR2 agonism in cancer immunotherapy, and
demonstrate the utility of target-agnostic screening in highlighting important targets
during drug discovery.

INTRODUCTION

receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) such as OX40 and 4-1BB
(CD137) [6, 7]. In addition to enhancing the activation
of effector T (Teff) cells, it may also be useful to inhibit
regulatory T (Treg) cells or other immuno-suppressive cell
populations within tumors [8]. Indeed, Treg modulation
may contribute towards the efficacy of certain cancer
therapies. For example, recent mechanistic studies indicate
the anti-CCR4 mAb mogamulizumab, approved for the
treatment of relapsed adult T cell leukemia (ATL) in
Japan [9], could reduce the number of Treg cells in cancer
patients [10]. Meta-analysis of clinical data indicates that
increased CD8+ Teff/Treg ratios correlate to improved

Immune-mediated cancer therapies, particularly
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target cell-surface
receptors expressed by T cells, are rapidly emerging as a
valuable class of cancer drugs. Clinical data indicate that
antagonists of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)
and programmed cell death protein 1/programmed deathligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) can lead to durable anti-tumor
immune responses [1–5], and have led to widespread
interest in targeting other T cell surface antigens, including
co-stimulatory members of the tumor necrosis factor

prognosis in multiple cancer types [11]. Identifying novel
drug targets expressed by Teff and/or Treg cells will allow
for novel drug combinations, and ultimately may lead
to enhanced clinical response rates and bring significant
benefit to patient populations that currently fail to respond
to existing therapies [12].
The search for a unique cell-surface marker that
reproducibly identifies human or mouse Treg populations
has been challenging. As such, Tregs are currently
categorised by the expression of two cell surface markers,
CD4 and CD25 [13], and the intracellular transcription
factor Foxp3 [14]. Previous attempts have been made
to identify novel Treg surface markers using unbiased
antibody screening of hybridomas from mice immunised
with human Treg cells [15]. However, despite extensive
screening, the antibodies isolated from this Treg
immunisation approach were only able to identify existing,
known markers such as CD25 and MHC class II, which on
their own have limited Treg selectivity.
Our previous work has shown that phage display
enrichment of diverse antibody libraries by panning on
cells, followed by antibody screening for selective binding
or desired function can be an effective, target-agnostic
approach to identify novel markers and indeed therapeutic
targets [16–18]. We have also demonstrated that phage
display may have advantages over hybridoma-based
screening, due to the ability to rationally deselect antibodies
to known or abundant antigens, therefore enabling access to
wider pools of targets during the screening process [17, 18].
For these reasons, we employed a target-agnostic
phage display screening approach on human Treg cells to
find antibody mimetics with preferential binding to Treg,
rather than Teff, cells. For optimal performance during
the phage display step we used designed ankyrin repeat
proteins (DARPins) [19–22], antibody mimetics which are
particularly suitable for cell-based selections, due to high
levels of display on phage [18]. To our surprise, all of the
most selective DARPins prioritised from this screen were
found to bind specifically to tumor necrosis factor receptor
2 (TNFR2, TNFRSF1B), a receptor for membrane-bound
TNF-α [23]. Some of the DARPins were found to also
agonise TNFR2, activating the NF-κB signalling pathway
in primary human Treg cells and Jurkat T cells transfected
with TNFR2. Furthermore, we demonstrated, using mousereactive TNFR2-specific agonists, that we could enhance
anti-tumor immunity in the CT26 syngeneic tumor model.
Together these data provide support for TNFR2-specific
agonists as potential cancer immunotherapy drugs.

human CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were isolated from healthy
donor peripheral blood as described in Materials and
Methods (Figure 1A) [24]. Purity was assessed by staining
for Foxp3 (Supplementary Figure S1A) and Treg phenotype
confirmed using in vitro suppression assays (Supplementary
Figure S1B). Phage display cell affinity selections were
performed using a DARPin library, de-selecting using a
panel of recombinant T cell markers (listed in Materials
and Methods). The selection output following two rounds of
selections was sub-cloned, and sequencing identified 1843
unique DARPin clones from a total population of 2816
clones sequenced (65% sequence diversity). The binding of
the 1843 unique potential Treg binding DARPins, expressed
as mouse IgG2a Fc fusion proteins, to activated human Treg
and CD4+ Teff cells was investigated using high-throughput
microscopy and flow cytometry (Figure 1A–1C). A group
of 56 DARPins were identified that bound to Treg and not
to activated CD4+CD25- Teff cells; from these a group of 26
DARPins were deprioritised due to their binding activated
human NK cells, B cells, monocytes, or broad populations
of cells amongst human peripheral blood leukocytes.
Finally, thirty DARPins were identified (hereafter referred
to as TREG001 to TREG030), which bound selectively to
activated human Treg cells.

DARPins bind to TNFR2
To investigate epitope redundancy amongst the
thirty Treg-binding DARPins, TREG001 and TREG002
were arbitrarily chosen and each was labelled with biotin
and used to stain Treg cells following pre-incubation
with unlabelled samples of each of the thirty DARPins
of interest (Supplementary Figure S2). In every case, preincubation reduced the extent of biotinylated TREG001
and TREG002 binding to Treg cells, indicating that the
thirty DARPins bound to the same antigen. To identify
this antigen, TREG001, TREG002, and six others were
tested for binding to a membrane protein expression
library array. The DARPins were observed to bind to
cells expressing TNFRSF1B, which encodes TNFR2. This
result was then confirmed using a limited panel of genes
including TNFRSF1B, genes encoding Fcγ receptors, and
a protein for which non-specific binding is frequently
observed (RASGRP1; Figure 2A).
To further confirm TNFR2 was the target antigen
for the Treg DARPins, activated Treg cells were incubated
with goat anti-human TNFR2 polyclonal antibodies
(pAb), which were observed to result in loss of binding
by DARPins (Supplementary Figure S3A). DARPins
TREG005 and TREG006 were then chosen for more
detailed analysis, on the basis of high staining intensity,
high yields following transient transfections, and low levels
of aggregation in solution (data not shown). TREG005 and
TREG006 bound to recombinant TNFR2 but not to TNFR1,
TNFR3, or osteoprotegerin, which has high sequence
similarity to TNFR2 (Supplementary Figure S3B).

Characterising the interaction between DARPins
and TNFR2

Lymphocyte sub-sets were identified using mAbs specific
for TCRαβ, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD56, and CD127. TNF-α
was used as a positive control to induce i-κBα degradation
in all cells via TNFR1 (Figure 3A, 3B). TREG005 induced
degradation of i-κBα within CD4+CD25+CD127lo Treg
cells, while effects on non-Treg cell populations were less
pronounced and were not significant (Figures 3A, 4B).
To a lesser extent, TREG006 also induced degradation
of i-κBα within Treg cells (data not shown). Degradation
of i-κBα in Treg cells in response to TNFR2-binding
DARPins was consistent with expression of TNFR2 by
Treg cells (Supplementary Figure S6A). Furthermore,
using Jurkat-based reporter cells, TREG005 and TREG006
were observed to induce NF-κB-dependent expression
of firefly luciferase (Figure 3C). This activity depended
on transfection to express TNFR2, and was enhanced by
cross-linking with a polyclonal anti-human Fcγ antibody
(data not shown), indicating TREG005 and TREG006
are TNF-α-independent agonists which induce NFκB signalling by clustering TNFR2 molecules. A more
detailed investigation into the downstream effects of
DARPin-mediated TNFR2 signalling is on-going and will
be reported elsewhere.

TREG005 and TREG006 were observed to
bind to Treg cells with half-maximal binding at
concentrations of ~100 pM and 10 pM respectively (EC50
values; Supplementary Figure S3C) and to constructs
incorporating the third and fourth extracellular cysteinerich domains of TNFR2, but not to a TNFR2 construct
lacking these domains (Supplementary Figure S4A, S4B).
Binding of TNFR2 to immobilised TREG005 and
TREG006 was abrogated by pre-incubation of TNFR2
with TNF-α (Figure 2B), and binding to immobilised
TNF-α was reduced by pre-incubation with TREG005 and
TREG006 but not control DARPin E3_5 (Supplementary
Figure S5). Therefore these DARPins bound to TNFR2 in
a TNF-α-competitive manner.

TREG005 and TREG006 induce NF-κB
signalling in Treg cells
TNFR2 signalling promotes T cell activation by
activating the NF-κB signalling pathway via degradation
of inhibitor of κB (i-κB) proteins [25]. To investigate
the potential effects of TNFR2-binding DARPins on
T cells, human PBMCs were cultured with negative
control DARPin E3_5 or TREG005 for 15 min, followed
by analysis of i-κBα degradation by flow cytometry.

Profiling TNFR2 expression
TNFR2 expression has been widely reported for
Treg cells and other T cell populations [26–28]. To profile

TNFR2 expression, human PBMCs were cultured in
the presence or absence of PHA-P and IL-2, and then
stained for binding by anti-TNFR2 or control mAbs
and a lineage panel comprising CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25,
CD56 and Foxp3. TNFR2 was expressed by unstimulated
CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells, but not by other evaluated
unstimulated lymphocyte populations (Supplementary
Figure S6A). Following PHA-P/IL-2 stimulation,
TNFR2 was additionally expressed by CD4+Foxp3and CD8+ Teff cells, and NK cells. Next, PBMCs from
HLA-A+ individuals with pre-determined reactivity to
cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 antigen were incubated
with pp65 peptide NLVPMVATV and profiled for TNFR2
expression. In addition to TNFR2 expression by Treg cells,
greater intensity expression was observed for pp65-specific
CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Figure S6B, S6C). Of
note, TNFR2 expression was observed for all or most
pp65-specific CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Figure S6C,
S6D). These data indicate that TNFR2 is expressed by
unstimulated Treg cells, and is also expressed by activated
Teff cells and NK cells.
Next, TNFR2 expression by tumor-infiltrating T
cells was investigated. Expression of GITR and OX40 by
tumor-infiltrating T cells was also investigated because,
like TNFR2, these are co-stimulatory TNFRSF members
which have been reported to be expressed by Treg cells
[29]. Tumor samples from three lung cancer patients were
analysed by flow cytometry, staining for CD19, CD3, CD4,
CD8, Foxp3, TNFR2, GITR and OX40 (Figure 4A, 4B).
High levels of TNFR2 expression were detected for
CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, while lower levels were
detected for CD4+Foxp3- and CD8+ T cells (Figure 4A, 4B).
Similarly, the highest levels of GITR and OX40 were also
detected for CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells and lower levels for
CD4+Foxp3- Teff cells. In contrast to TNFR2, very low
or undetectable levels of GITR and OX40 were observed

for CD8+ T cells. Together, these data indicate that
TNFR2 is expressed by Treg and Teff cells within lung
tumors; TNFR2 has a similar expression profile to OX40
and GITR, and is additionally expressed by tumoral
CD8+ T cells.
To investigate TNFR2 expression within a broader
sample of human cancers, publicly available gene
expression data were analysed (The Cancer Genome
Atlas). Expression of TNFRSF1B was observed to
correlate with CD3E expression (a marker for T cell
infiltration of tumors) [30] for multiple tumor types,
including bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive
carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,
kidney carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma,
prostate adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and uterine corpus
endometrial carcinoma (Supplementary Figure S7). These
data support the hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating Treg
and other T cells in multiple tumor types express TNFR2
[31, 32].
Next, to profile TNFR2 expression within a preclinical tumor model, immuno-competent mice were
implanted with CT26 colorectal tumor cells. CT26 tumors
may provide a good model for immune responses to
tumors which are responsive to cancer immunotherapy,
due to a high mutational burden [33]. TNFR2 expression
was observed for CD4+Foxp3+ Treg and NKp46+ NK cells
in all tissues examined, and was additionally observed for
tumor-infiltrating CD4+Foxp3- and CD8+ T cells, and for
splenic CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells from tumor-bearing
animals (Figure 4). Tumor-infiltrating Treg cells expressed
the highest levels of TNFR2. Mouse NK cell TNFR2
expression was constant for all tissues investigated,
and likely reflects a species difference between mice
and humans. Together, these data indicate that TNFR2
is expressed by Treg cells and by effector T cells in the
context of anti-tumor immune responses.

TNFR2 mAbs enhance anti-tumor immunity in
immuno-competent mice

mAbs can be cross-linked by a sub-set of mouse FcγRs
but should not be expected to mediate antibody-dependent
cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).
Growth of CT26 tumors in immuno-competent mice
was inhibited by administration of TNFR2 mAbs, compared
to control animals which received saline or hamster IgG
control mAbs (Figure 5A–5D). Median survival (median
time taken to reach a consistent humane end-point based
on tumor size) was 36 and 30.5 days after implantation for
animals which received TR75-54.7 or TR75-89 anti-TNFR2
mAbs, compared to 22 days or 25 days for animals which
received saline or hamster IgG control mAb respectively
(p < 0.0001; Figure 5E). Based on reported serum half-lives
of approximately two days [34], approximately 90% of the
total exposure to anti-TNFR2 mAbs occurred within ten
days following the first dose. Therefore, the duration of
tumor growth inhibition and enhanced survival were similar
to the exposure to TNFR2 agonists.
Complete tumor regression was observed for two
out of 34 animals which received anti-TNFR2 mAb TR7554.7, and three out of 34 animals which received TR75-89
(Figure 5E). No tumor growth was observed when these
animals were re-challenged with CT26 cells at least thirty
days after tumor regression, while CT26 cells implanted
into previously untreated control animals grew normally
(data not shown). This indicates that TNFR2 mAbs
induced long-lasting immunological memory against
CT26 tumor cells.

The TNFR2 agonists identified by phenotypic
screening did not cross-react with mouse TNFR2 since
they were raised against human Treg cells. Therefore
mouse-reactive TNFR2 agonist mAbs were sourced
and used as surrogates to explore anti-tumor immunity
in immuno-competent mice. Clone TR75-54.7 hamster
anti-mouse TNFR2 mAb was previously found to
compete with TNF-α, and to act as a TNFR2 agonist
when cross-linked in vitro, detected by proliferation
of the CT6 T cell-line [34]. Here, TR75-54.7 was
confirmed to be a TNF-α-competitive TNFR2 agonist
using bio-layer interferometry and a cell-based NF-κB
reporter system (Supplementary Figure S8 and
S9), therefore indicating this mAb is a suitable
surrogate for the TNFR2-binding agonist DARPins.
An additional anti-TNFR2 mAb (clone TR75-89)
was investigated, which is also a TNFR2 agonist but does
not compete with TNF-α [Supplementary Figures S8
and S9, and 34]. There is now broad evidence that mAbs
targeting TNFRSF members can act as agonists in vivo
due to cross-linking by FcγR-expressing cells [35, 36].
Binding to recombinant mouse FcγRII and FcγRIII was
observed for anti-TNFR2 mAbs TR75-54.7 and TR75-89,
although no interaction with FcγRI or FcγRIV was
observed (Supplementary Table S1), indicating these

To investigate the mechanism by which TNFR2binding mAbs enhanced anti-tumor immunity, separate
groups of CT26 tumor-bearing animals which received
TNFR2 mAbs were sacrificed eighteen days after
implantation and analysed by flow cytometry. Tumoral
CD8+ T cell populations were greater for animals that
received anti-TNFR2 mAbs than for controls (as a
proportion of total tumoral CD45+ cells, Figure 5F),
resulting in increased CD8+ T cell/Treg ratios (Figure 5G).
No statistically significant effects on CD4+Foxp3- Teff
cells, CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells, CD3-NKp46+ NK cells or
CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells were observed, and no effects
were observed for any of these populations within spleens
or tumor-draining inguinal lymph nodes (data not shown).
Intratumoral CD8+ T cells expressed slightly higher levels
of inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) in response to
TNFR2 agonist mAbs (Figure 5H), and splenic CD8+
T cells from mice which received TNFR2 agonist mAbs
expressed higher levels of IFN-γ than cells from control
animals, when stimulated with PMA/ionomycin in the
presence of Brefeldin-A (Figure 5J).

these cells. This may reflect a difference in the strength
of T cell stimulation provided by anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs
compared to other polyclonal stimuli or cognate antigenic
stimulation. Together, these data support the idea that
TNFR2 agonists may provide a means to therapeutically
modulate tumoral Treg and Teff cells.
Therapeutic modulation of TNFR2 was investigated
in mice bearing CT26 sub-cutaneous syngeneic tumors.
Within these tumors, high levels of TNFR2 were found
to be expressed by CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells, with lower
levels for CD4+Foxp3- and CD8+ T cells (Figure 4C).
That is, a similar expression pattern was observed as for
T cells within human NSCLC tumors. TNFR2 expression
was also observed for splenic CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells in
naïve and tumor-bearing animals, and human peripheral
blood Treg cells, confirming constitutive expression
by Treg cells in the periphery of both species. These
data demonstrate the relevance of the CT26 syngeneic
tumor model for investigating TNFR2 agonists in cancer
immunotherapy.
High-specificity binding to targets is a key
advantage of biologics over small molecule drugs, but
frequently also leads to a lack of cross-reactivity with nonprimate species. Hence, research within the field of cancer
immunotherapy is frequently based on rodent-reactive
surrogate reagents. For example, mouse-reactive antiCTLA-4 and anti-PD-L1 mAbs were used pre-clinically
prior to clinical evaluation of human-reactive mAbs
targeting these pathways [38, 39, and reviewed in 40].
Accordingly, a mouse-reactive TNF-α-competitive TNFR2
agonist mAb was used here as a surrogate for the TNFR2
agonist DARPins. This TNFR2 agonist mAb enhanced
tumor infiltration and IFN-γ synthesis by CD8+ T cells
in the CT26 tumor model, resulting in tumor growth
inhibition and prolonging survival by approximately 5–15
days (Figure 5). These data provide in vivo support for
exploring TNFR2 agonists in cancer therapy.
Antibodies and related molecules can enhance the
immune response to cancer either through antagonism
of immunosuppressive molecules, such as anti-CTLA-4
or PD-1 mAbs, through agonist activity, as previously
described for mAbs targeting TNFRSF family members
including GITR, OX40, CD40, and 4-1BB [41], or by
depleting specific cell-types [42]. In principal, the TNF-αcompetitive anti-TNFR2 mAb used here could influence
anti-tumor immune responses through blockade of TNF-α
binding to TNFR2. However, very similar effects on tumor
growth were observed for a different TNFR2 agonist mAb
which does not compete with TNF-α, demonstrating
that antagonism did not contribute appreciably to the
therapeutic activity of the anti-TNFR2 mAbs. Similarly,
while intra-tumoral depletion of Treg cells was recently
found to contribute to the anti-tumor activity of CTLA4 mAbs in mouse models [42], intra-tumoral and splenic
Treg populations were not significantly depleted by
TNFR2 mAbs, and the hamster anti-TNFR2 mAbs used

DISCUSSION
Phenotypic screening for antibody mimetics with
selectivity for human Treg cells has highlighted TNFR2
as a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.
This approach was made possible by high purity isolation
and in vitro expansion of human peripheral blood Treg
cells, and through the use of DARPins, antibody mimetics
which exhibit enhanced levels of display on phage
[18–22]. Rapid target identification was achieved using
membrane protein expression arrays (Figure 2A). Some
of the TNFR2-specific DARPins were observed to induce
i-κBα degradation in resting human Treg cells (Figure 3B),
and to mediate NF-κB signalling in Jurkat T cells
expressing TNFR2 (Figure 3C). The NF-κB signalling
pathway is a key determinant of T cell activation [25], and
has been implicated in down-regulation of Treg-mediated
suppressive activity [37]. These observations indicate the
potential for TNFR2-specific agonists to therapeutically
enhance T cell-mediated immunity.
TNFR2 expression by melanoma, colorectal cancer
and lung cancer TILs has been reported previously [31],
but data for expression by specific T cell sub-sets were not
available. Here, TNFR2 expression was observed for Treg
cells within human lung tumor samples and healthy donor
PBMCs (Figure 4A, 4B, Supplementary Figure S6A).
Additionally, lower intensity TNFR2 expression was
observed for tumor-infiltrating CD4+Foxp3- and CD8+ Teff
cells, and for PBMC-derived Teff cells following in vitro
stimulation with PHA-P/IL-2 or specific cognate antigenic
peptide (Supplementary Figure S6). TNFR2-binding
DARPins were not initially observed to bind to CD3/
CD28-stimulated CD4+ Teff in the cell-based screening
cascade (Figure 1), due to minimal TNFR2 expression by

here did not bind detectably to mouse FcγRI or FcγRIV,
indicating these mAbs are unlikely to induce ADCP
(Supplementary Table S1). The ability of the mousereactive TNFR2 mAbs to induce TNFR2 signalling has
been described previously [34], was confirmed here using
in vitro reporter assays (Supplementary Figure S9), and
is supported by the observation that these mAbs bind to,
hence may be cross-linked by, mouse FcγRII and FcγRIII
(Supplementary Table S1). In summary, the most likely
mechanism for TNFR2 mAb-induced tumor growth
inhibition is TNFR2 agonism, and associated changes in
T cell function.
In contrast to the near-ubiquitous expression of
TNFR1, expression of TNFR2 is confined to specific
populations of cells including regulatory T cells, activated
effector T cells and NK cells. TNFR2 agonist mAbs were

observed to increase the numbers of CD8+ T within tumors,
resulting in increased CD8+ Teff/Treg ratios, to increase the
expression of ICOS by tumoral CD8+ T cells, and to enhance
the level of IFN-γ synthesis by CD8+ T cells following
ex vivo stimulation (Figure 5). Although mouse NK cells
were observed to express TNFR2 (Figure 4), likely reflecting
a species-specific difference between mice and humans, no
effects on NK cell frequency or expression of activation
markers were observed in vivo in response to TNFR2 mAbs
(Figure 5). This suggests that TNFR2 molecules expressed
by NK cells do not contribute towards the therapeutic
mechanism of action for TNFR2 agonists in this model.
Taken together, the pharmacodynamic data indicate a central
role for CD8+ T cells in the response to TNFR2 agonists, and
are also compatible with TNFR2-mediated down-regulation
of Treg cell suppressive activity [37, 43].

TNFR2 signalling has previously been shown to
enhance T cell activation and decrease Treg-mediated
suppression [43–45], possibly via phosphorylation of the
transcription factor Foxp3 [46], and via activation of the

NF-κB signalling pathway in Treg cells [37]. Proliferation
of adoptively transferred Ag-specific T cells in an LCMV
glycoprotein-driven tumor model was impaired for
TNFR2-deficient T cells [47], supporting the idea that

TNFR2 contributes to anti-tumor immunity. However,
other reports have suggested that TNFR2 agonism could
be detrimental towards anti-tumor immunity, either
by inducing activation-induced cell death (AICD) of
T cells [48, 49], or by enhancing the activation and
suppressive activity of Treg cells [50] or myeloid-derived
suppressor cells [51]. Inhibition of TNFR2 using antisense oligonucleotide technology was observed to reduce
experimental liver metastasis by H-59 cells in mice [52],
and in one report, growth of syngeneic tumors in TNFR2deficient mice was reduced compared to wild-type animals
[52], while in another study, tumor growth in TNFR2deficient animals was initially increased but at later
time-points was reduced compared to wild-type animals
[49]. While we cannot rule out any detrimental effects of
TNFR2 agonism on anti-tumor immunity, overall, the net
effect of administering TNFR2 agonist mAbs to tumorbearing mice was clearly to enhance anti-tumor immunity.
Clinical evaluation of TNFR2-specific agonists
could be performed using biologics based on DARPins
described here, supported by previous investigational
administration of DARPins to patients [53].
Alternatively, human-reactive TNFR2 agonist mAbs
could be generated by phage display or immunisation
approaches. We anticipate TNFR2 agonists will be most
effective for treating tumors with a T cell-inflamed
phenotype [54]. Publicly available data indicate a
positive correlation between CD3E and TNFRSF1B
expression (Supplementary Figure S7), suggesting that
for many T cell-inflamed tumors, target expression
may be sufficiently high to support responses to
TNFR2-targeted therapy. In these settings, dominant
immunological tolerance is frequently maintained
within the tumor micro-environment by the PD-1/PDL1 axis. Consequently, novel immuno-oncology drugs
are very often investigated in combination with PD-1 or
PD-L1 blockade [12]; this is an attractive combination
strategy for TNFR2 agonists, which should be tested
pre-clinically prior to clinical investigation. On the basis
of the favourable pre-clinical activity observed here
for TNFR2 agonists, we propose that TNFR2-specific
agonist biologics represent an attractive candidate for
development as cancer immunotherapy drugs.

CD4+CD25- Teff and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were isolated
using negative selection followed by CD25 selection
(Dynal CD4+CD25+ Treg Kit, Invitrogen; or human CD4+
T cell enrichment and human CD25 positive selection
kits, StemCell Technologies). CD4+CD25+ cells were
cultured in X-vivo15 medium (Lonza) supplemented with
5% human AB serum (Life Technologies), HEPES (Life
Technologies), 1000 U/mL interleukin (IL)-2 (Roche
Diagnostics) and 100 nM rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Anti-CD3/CD28 beads were added (Human Treg expander
kit, Life Technologies) at a cell:bead ratio of 1:4. Cells
were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C/5% CO2
for 7–9 days, with addition of fresh medium containing
500 U/mL IL-2 every 2–3 days. CD3/CD28 beads
were then removed, the cells washed and fresh medium
containing 100 U/mL of IL-2 and 100 nM rapamycin was
added every 2–3 days. To assess purity, cells were fixed
and permeabilised (Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining
Buffer Set, eBioscience), stained using PE-conjugated
anti-Foxp3 mAbs (clone PCH101) and analysed by
flow cytometry (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences). CD4+
effector T cells were activated using anti-CD3/CD28 beads
(Human T-activator or Treg expander beads, Invitrogen)
and 30 U/mL IL-2 (Roche Diagnostics) for four days.

Cell-based DARPin phage display affinity
selections
DARPins have been described previously [19, 21].
Two rounds of cell-based affinity selections were each
performed on 107 activated expanded Treg cells originating
from seven donors using a DARPin phage display library
containing up to 109 binding members, as described
previously [17, 18]. The following recombinant human
proteins were included as de-selection antigens: TCR
α and β chains, CD5 (Cambridge Biosciences); CD69,
CD3ε, and ITGB2 (Sino Biological); CD2 (Abcam);
CD132, CD122, CD39, IL-10Rα, sCD4, CD109, IL-1R,
IL-6Rα, IL-14Rα, IFN-γR1, CD45, CD38, TNFRI, 4-1BB,
CD30, GITR, PD-1, B7-H1, CD44, CD25, CD27, and
CD28 (R&DSystems). DARPins isolated from two rounds
of selections were reformatted as either human IgG1 Fc
domain fusions or mouse IgG2a Fc domain fusions and
expressed in HEK293 cells (ATCC).

and Teff cells
+

Mouse IgG2a DARPin-Fc fusions were initially
screened for binding Treg and Teff cells using 8200
Cellular Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and flow
cytometry experiments (Figure 1 only). For subsequent
experiments, purified human IgG1 Fc-tagged DARPins
were used at 5 µg/mL. Where appropriate, cells were
pre-incubated with 200 µg/mL goat anti-TNFR2 pAb
(R&DSystems). Cells were incubated with DARPins for

Healthy donor leukapheresis samples were obtained
from Research Blood Components (Brighton, MA) or
the UK National Health Service Blood and Transfusion
services (NHSBT, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
isolated by Ficoll-Paque centrifugation (GE Healthcare).

90 min at 4°C (or in the case of titrations, on ice with
agitation for 16 h) washed, incubated with DyLight649labelled goat anti-mouse or anti-human IgG pAb (Jackson
Immunoresearch) for 45 min at 4°C and washed again.
Alternatively, cells were incubated with unlabelled
DARPins at a concentration of 400 µg/mL for 90 min,
after which an equal volume containing biotinylated
DARPins at 50 µg/mL was added without washing, the
cells incubated for a further 45 min, washed, stained using
APC-labelled streptavidin (eBioscience) for 45 min and
washed again. Cells were fixed and analysed by flow
cytometry (FACSCantoII, BD Biosciences).

(Sigma) using a Zeba-Spin 7k MWCO 0.5 mL column
(Pierce). Competition experiments were performed by
Biolayer Interferometry (OctetRed384, ForteBio). In each
case, one protein component (i.e. DARPin-Fc, biotinylated
TNF-α or biotinylated anti-mouse TNFR2 mAb) was
immobilised on either streptavidin- or protein A-coated
Dip and Read™ biosensors (ForteBio) as appropriate (load
step, typically 120 s), then the response was measured
while the sensors were sequentially transferred to wells
containing buffer only (baseline step, 60 s), ligand proteins
± excess competitor proteins (association step, typically
180 or 300 s), then buffer only (dissociation step, varying
durations). Assays were performed at 25°C with 1000 rpm
shaking, and using proteins diluted in PBS containing
0.01% BSA 0.005% Tween-20.

Membrane protein expression arrays
Mouse IgG2a Fc-tagged DARPins were screened
for binding to 2505 human plasma membrane proteins
expressed in HEK293 cells using cell microarray
technology [Retrogenix, 54]. Transfection efficiency
was assessed by simultaneous transfection with pIREShEGFR-IRES-ZsGreen1. An AlexaFluor647-labelled
anti-mouse IgG detection antibody (Life Technologies)
was used to detect DARPin binding. To confirm binding,
primary hits were re-expressed in duplicate and probed
with DARPins or a negative control mouse Fc-fusion
protein.

i-κBα degradation assay
PBMCs were isolated from fresh whole blood
donated by volunteers of the Cambridge BioResource
with the approval of the Cambridge South Research
Ethics Committee (UK). PBMCs were cryopreserved,
defrosted, and cultured overnight in RPMI1640-based
medium at 37°C/5% CO2. Cells were washed and
incubated at 106 cells per mL in 500 µL medium per well,
supplemented where appropriate with 10 ng/mL TNF-α
or 10 µg/mL DARPins for 15 min at 37°C/5% CO2.
Cells were re-suspended, washed once with medium,
and stained in 100 µL per sample medium supplemented
with membrane staining antibodies (TCRαβ-FITC clone
IP26, CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 clone Okt4, CD8-BV711
clone SK1, CD56-PE-Cy7 clone HCD56, CD25-APC
clone M-A251, CD127-BV421 clone eBioRDR5)
for 15 min at room temperature, protected from light.
Fixation/permeabilisation was performed according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Introprep, Beckman Coulter).
2 µL per sample of PE-labelled anti-ikBα (clone L35A5,
Cell signalling) or isotype control mAbs was added, and
the cells incubated for 15 minutes at RT, protected from
light. Cells were washed, fixed and analysed promptly by
flow cytometry (Fortessa, BD Biosciences).

ELISAs
Recombinant TNFR1, TNFR2 (R&D Systems),
TNFR3 (LTBR, Stratech) or Osteoprotegerin
(TNFRSF11B, Stratech) or recombinant FLAG-His10
tagged TNFR2 ECD constructs, described in detail in
Supplementary Materials and Methods, were immobilised
on Maxisorb 96-well plates (Nunc). Plates were washed
with PBS, blocked using 3% non-fat milk in PBS, then
washed again. DARPin-Fcs or control antibodies at
2 µg/mL in blocking solution were incubated on the plates
for 1 h at RT. Anti-TNFR2 mIgG2a clone 22235 (R&D
Systems), anti-His mIgG2b clone His.H8 (Millipore) and
mIgG2b isotype control mAbs were used as controls.
Plates were washed with PBS-Tween, then incubated with
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human or anti-mouse
IgG pAb (Sigma) in 3% non-fat milk/PBS-Tween. Plates
were washed again with PBS-Tween and developed using
3,3ʹ,5,5ʹ Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) liquid substrate,
followed by 0.5 M H2SO4, and absorption at 450 nm
determined (Envision, Perkin Elmer).

TNFR2 signalling assays
Jurkat E6.1 cells were transfected to express
TNFR2 and NF-κB-dependent luciferase (described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods). 105 cells per
well were added to opaque 96-well tissue culture plates
(Corning) in 200 µL per well of RPMI-based medium
supplemented with DARPins or mAbs, incubated at
37°C/5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for 5.5 h, and
luciferase was quantified (Steady-Glo luciferase assay,
Promega; Envision 96-well plate reader, Perkin Elmer).

TNF-α competition binding analyses
Recombinant human TNF-α (R&DSystems) or
anti-mouse TNFR2 mAbs TR75-54.7 and TR75-89
(R&DSystems) were biotinylated using EZ-Link SulfoNHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) then buffer exchanged into PBS

Animal studies

ionomycin (1 µg/mL; Sigma) and brefeldin-A (3 µg/mL,
Ebioscience) and incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 5 h, after
which they were washed, stained with CD3-BV650 (clone
17A2), CD4-BV785 (clone RM4-5), CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5
(clone 53–6.7) and CD19-APC-H7 (clone 1D3) mAbs,
fixed/permeabilised, stained with Foxp3-PacificBlue
(clone MF1-4) and IFN-γ-APC (clone XMG1-2) mAbs,
and analysed by flow cytometry as above.

Experiments were conducted using female Balb/c
mice (Charles River) aged 8–12 weeks in accordance with
the United Kingdom Home Office Animals (Scientific
Procedures) Act 1986 and in accordance with EU
Directive EU 86/609. Colorectal CT26 tumors (ATCC)
were established by subcutaneous injection of 5 × 105
cells in 100 µL PBS into the flank. Animal weights were
between 18 g and 23 g on the day of implantation. Tumor
growth was monitored using callipers, and volumes
estimated as half the product of the length multiplied by
the width squared.

Human lung tumor analysis
Surgical resection samples from three lung cancer
patients were analysed by Caprion Biosciences Inc (Québec,
Canada). This work was approved by the Comité éthique en
recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal.
Informed consent was obtained using informed consent
forms. Tumors from patients 1 and 2 were adenocarcinoma
(non-small cell lung cancer; NSCLC) and the tumor from
Patient 3 was small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (small
cell lung cancer, SCLC). Briefly, tumor samples were cut
into pieces using a scalpel, disaggregated mechanically
(Medimachine, BD Biosciences) and stained using a
panel including a dead cell detection reagent (Invitrogen),
CD19-BV711 (clone HIB19), CD3-BV786 (clone SP342), CD4-BV605 (clone RPA-T4), CD8-BV650 (clone
RPA-T8), TNFR2-Alexa647 (clone hTNFR-M1), GITRPerCP-eFluor710 (clone eBioAITR), OX40-PE-CF594
(clone ACT35) or appropriate isotype-matched controls,
and Foxp3-Alexa700 (clone PCH101) mAbs or appropriate
isotype-matched controls. Samples were analysed by flow
cytometry (Fortessa, BD Biosciences), and data analysis
was performed using FlowJo X.0.7 (TreeStar).

TNFR2 expression profiling in tumor-bearing
animals
10–12 days after tumor implantation, animals were
sacrificed, spleens and tumors were removed. Spleens
were disaggregated and filtered, and red blood cell lysis
was performed (Sigma). Tumors were disaggregated
according to manufacturer’s instructions (mouse tumor
dissociation kit II, GentleMACS dissociator, Miltenyi
Biotech). Cells were stained using amine-reactive dye
(Fixable blue dead cell stain kit, Invitrogen), washed and
stained with panels incorporating CD45-BV570 (clone 30F11), CD3-V450 (clone 17A2), CD4-APC (clone RM4.5),
CD8-APC-H7 (clone 53–6.7), NKp46-EFluor450 (clone
29A1.4), CD11b-APC (clone RM4.5), Gr1-APC-Cy7
(clone RB6-8C5), and TNFR2-DyLight488 (clone TR7589), or isotype-matched control mAbs. Subsequent flow
cytometry analysis was performed as for human cells
except mouse-reactive Foxp3-PE mAbs were used (clone
FJK-16S).

Cell-lines

Investigating effects of TNFR2 mAbs in vivo

All cell-lines used here were confirmed to be free
of mycoplasma contamination using PCR, indirect Höchst
stain and culture isolation methods (ECACC). Cell-lines
were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling, cell
morphology, karyotyping, and cytochrome C oxidase I
methods by the supplier (ATTC), and passaged for less
than six months after resuscitation.

Eleven days after CT26 tumor implantation, animals
were assigned to treatment groups by spiral randomisation
such that all groups received an equivalent distribution
of tumor sizes. On days 11, 14 and 18 after implantation,
animals were injected i.p. with 100 µg of anti-TNFR2
mAbs (clones TR75-54.7 or TR75-89, Biolegend) or
irrelevant control mAbs (clone HTK888, Biolegend) in
100 µL PBS. Animals were sacrificed when tumors reached
maximum permissible size (15 mm average diameter).
Animals in which tumors regressed completely were reimplanted with CT26 in the contralateral flank at least 31
days after tumors were last detectable. For flow cytometry
analysis, animals did not receive the third dose of mAbs on
day 18, and were instead sacrificed and organs processed as
above. Cells were stained and analysed by flow cytometry
as above except omitting TNFR2 staining. For cytokine
analysis, 106 splenocytes per well were added to wells of
96-well plates (Costar) in a volume of 200 µL RPMI1640
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, β-mercaptoethanol
(500 µM; Life Technologies), PMA (20 ng/mL; Sigma),
