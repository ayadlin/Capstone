ABSTRACT:
The transcriptional coactivator YAP1 is a critical effector of the human SalvadorWarts-Hippo pathway. Literature data report apparently discrepant results on the
carcinogenic role of YAP1, which acts either as oncogene or as tumor suppressor in
different in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, genomic amplification events of
11q22 locus encompassing YAP1 gene have been detected in multiple tumor types
but there is limited direct evidence about the oncogenic role of endogenous YAP1
within in the amplicon.
We screened a panel of human tumor samples and cancer cell lines and identified
that the YAP1 amplification event is actually present in up to 23% of the cases. We
exploited EKVX (lung cancer), CaSki (cervical cancer) and RO82 (thyroid cancer) cell
lines harboring both genomic YAP1 amplification and YAP1 protein overexpression, in
order to study the effects of downregulation of endogenous YAP1 by RNA-interference
strategies. Class comparison analysis of gene expression profiling data identified
707 statistically significantly modulated genes (multivariable global test p-value =
0.002) that were functionally annotated for cell proliferation and cellular movement
ontologies. Mechanistic studies of the identified perturbed pathways revealed that
YAP1 silencing significantly decreased cell proliferation and cell cycle perturbation
associated with upregulation of p21 and p27 cell-cycle inhibitors, reduced cell
migration (p<0.048) and anchorage-independent growth (p<0.02). In CaSki cell line,
YAP1 silencing induced significantly increased sensitivity and cell-death response to
cisplatin treatment (p=0.011) as well as reduction of in-vivo tumorigenic potential
(p=0.027).
Overall, these results establish that YAP1 is a direct oncogenic target of the
11q22 amplicon in previously unreported cancer types and support the relevance of
such genetic aberration in carcinogenesis in a fraction of multiple tumor types.

INTRODUCTION

of the BIRC family of caspase inhibitors (BIRC2 and
BIRC3) [31] and the progesterone receptor (PGR) [32].
As a consequence, there is no direct evidence about the
oncogenic role of endogenous YAP1 in the context of
cancer cells carrying the 11q22 amplification event.
In the present work we corroborate that YAP1 plays
an important role in the tumorigenic phenotype of 11q22amplified cancer cell lines, as it effectively supports
multiple transformed properties. Moreover we detect
YAP1 copy number amplification in clinical series of
different human tumor types and identify the downstream
genes and pathways that are critical as YAP1 effectors in
carcinogenesis.

The recently described Salvador-Warts-Hippo
pathway (SWH or Hippo pathway) is highly conserved
throughout evolution [1] and is crucially involved in organ
size regulation [2,3]. Hippo pathway consists of several
negative growth regulators acting in a kinase cascade
that ultimately inactivates Yorkie in Drosophila or YAP1
(Yes-associated protein 1) in mammalian; these two
effector proteins are both transcriptional coactivators that
positively regulate cell growth, survival and proliferation
[4]. Therefore YAP1, which is localized in 11q22 genomic
region, represents a critical downstream regulatory target
of this signaling pathway [5].
Literature data so far described the involvement of
YAP1 in carcinogenesis contradictorily. Initially, YAP1
was classified as a tumor suppressor gene (or at least as
helper of tumor suppressors), as it was reported to exert
pro-apoptotic functions. Following DNA damage, YAP1
functions as a co-activator of TP73-mediated apoptosis
in TP53 null cells [6, 7], after phosphorylation of YAP1
at tyrosine 357 [8], following YAP1 dissociation from
cytoplasmatic multiprotein complex with 14-3-3 and Akt
[9] and as well as a result of RASSF1A activation [10].
As a consequence YAP1 translocates into the nucleus
promoting the assembly of the active complex inducing
the transcription of target genes [7]. YAP1 was also
proposed to be a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, as the
target of loss of heterzygosity in 11q22 genomic region
[11].
On the contrary, YAP1 was also described to
function as an oncogene by promoting increased organ
size and cancer development. YAP1 resulted amplified
in human hepatocellular carcinoma and cooperated
with myc oncogene to induce tumor growth in nude
mice [12]. In non-transformed mammary cells YAP1
ectopic overexpression induces alterations typical of a
transformed phenotypes, namely anchorage-independent
growth, EMT, growth factor independent proliferation,
activation of AKT/ERK and inhibition of apoptosis [13] .
In addition, in transgenic mouse models the liver-specific
YAP1 overexpession induced a dramatic increase of liver
organ size, eventually leading to cancer development [14,
15]. Moreover, recent data indicated that YAP1 activity
correlates with high histological grade and metastasis in
breast cancer [16]. Furthermore, the 11q22 genomic region
was found amplified in individual cases of several human
tumor types [12, 17-29] but the direct evidence of YAP1
amplification is described in very few of these cases [12,
21, 24, 26-28].
Notably, YAP1 point/small mutations have not been
described so far and the reported 11q22 amplification
events include multiple flanking genes in addition
to YAP1. Some of these genes have been involved
in cancer development, including a cluster of matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) genes [30], two members

RESULTS
Identification of cancer cell lines and clinical
specimen carrying 11q22 amplification and YAP1
overexpression.
Public and private genomic copy-number databases
were interrogated for the copy number status of loci
encompassing YAP1 (Supplemental Table 1). Notably,
homozygous deletion encompassing YAP1 gene was a very
rare event, in fact it was found only in 3/664 (0.5%) cancer
cell lines and in 3/1629 (0.2%) cancer tissue samples. In
contrast, YAP1 copy amplification event was found in a
greater percentage of the same samples (Chi-square test
p<0.0001). In fact, it was reported in 40/664 (6%) cancer
cell lines, in 31/1629 (1.9%) cancer tissue samples, in
2/110 (1.8%) primary cancer cell cultures and in 1/20 (5%)
xenograft tumors (Supplemental Table 1).
We focused our attention on tumor subtypes with
little or no established involvement of YAP1 gene, and
selected representative cancer cell lines, including CaSki cell line (Cervical squamous cell carcinoma), RO82
cell line (Follicular thyroid carcinoma) and EKVX cell
line (Non small-cell lung adenocarcinoma). Preliminary
experiments were performed in order to verify YAP1
amplification in these established cancer cell lines and to
evaluate the occurrence of YAP1 protein overexpression.
Ca-Ski, RO82 and EKVX cell lines showed YAP1 highcopy number (Figure 1a). FISH analysis allowed to
define that YAP1 copy amplification is contained in a
homogeneously staining region in Ca-Ski cell line or as
multiple interspersed copies (double minutes) in RO82
and in EKVX cell lines (Figure 1b). YAP1 amplification
correlated with protein overexpression as detected by
western blot analysis. In fact, Ca-Ski, RO82 and EKVX
cell lines show high protein level of both total- and
phospho(S127)- YAP1, compared to other cancer cell
lines lacking 11q22 amplification (Figure 1c). Mutational
analysis by exon amplification and sequencing was
performed, but no small/point mutations were detected in

The major known genetic and epigenetic traits of the cell
lines under study is reported in Supplemental Table2.
Literature data report that chromosome region
11q22, containing YAP1 gene, is amplified in a small
percentage of samples from multiple human tumor types
[12, 17-29]. We directly investigated the frequency
of YAP1 copy number amplification in clinical series
from different human tumor types and revealed YAP1
amplification in 4/25 (16%) cervical cancer samples, in
18/77 (23%) non small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), in
2/56 (3.6%), central nervous system tumors (CNS) and
in 0/15 thyroid cancers (Figure 1d). The 77 NSCLC
samples arrayed on a tissue microarray were assayed
using double-colour FISH. Since cyclin D1 is present
in the same chromosomal arm as YAP1 but in 11q13
and CCND1 is frequently amplified in lung cancer [33,

34], we used one probe specific for cyclin D1 gene and
another probe specific for YAP1 gene or FISH analyses.
Using such approach, we detected a large amplification
which included both YAP1 and CCND1 genes in 16/77
(21%) NSCLC samples, while 2/77 samples (2.6%)
carried an amplification restricted to YAP1 (Figure 1e).
We investigated the YAP1 copy number status of the
other clinical samples, which were available as individual
paraffin blocks, by a quantitative, real-time PCR approach.
YAP1 amplification was found in 4/25 (16%) cervical
cancer samples, including high copy amplification in
3/4 and low copy amplification in 1/4. YAP1 protein
expression was assayed by immunohistochemistry in these
cervical cancer samples, revealing that YAP1 protein level
was higher in samples carrying YAP1 copy amplification
compared to samples with normal YAP1 copy number
(p=0.021, Figure 1f).

parental and silenced cell lines was similarly quantified by
multiple antibodies, raised against different YAP1 epitopes
(Supplemental Figure 1b).

Endogenous YAP1 expression was modulated in
Ca-Ski, EKVX and RO82 cell lines by RNA interference
strategies. YAP1 silencing was performed using both
short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles and
small-interfering RNAs (siRNA). In stably infected shYAP1 bulk cell population, YAP1 residual expression
of mRNA was on average 30% and the YAP1 residual
protein expression was 15-30% (Figure 2a). In si-YAP1
short-term silenced cells, YAP1 mRNA was silenced with
a residual expression of about 10-20% and the protein
was efficiently downregulated with minimal expression
between 48 and 96 hours (Figure 2b). The three individual
siRNAs used effectively silenced YAP1 as much as an
equal total amount of the pool of the three combined
siRNAs (Supplemental Figure 1a). YAP1 protein level in

Identification of YAP1 target genes in 11q22amplified cancer cell lines.
Literature data report that YAP1 gene is a
transcriptional cofactor [35] but YAP1 target genes remain
poorly characterized and therefore we performed gene
expression profiling experiments with the aim to identify
YAP1 target genes that may mediate an oncogenic stimulus
in YAP1-amplified cell lines. Using class comparison
analyses comparing global gene expression profiles of
YAP1 proficient cells versus YAP1-silenced cells we
identified 707 statistically significantly modulated genes
at the uninominal p-value= 0.001 (multivariable global
test p-value=0.002, Figure 3 and Supplemental Table 3).

Among these target genes, 505 are down-regulated and
202 are up-regulated upon YAP1 silencing (Chi-square
p-value < 0.0001), thus suggesting that YAP1 mainly acts
as a transcriptional co-activator in the cancer cell lines
under study. Using different tools of functional annotation,
we found that the 707 genes identified are significantly
enriched for gene ontologies related to cell proliferation
and to cell movement molecular functions and suggesting
that YAP1 overexpression positively sustains these two
biological functions (Figure 3b and Supplemental Table
3). In order to pinpoint the YAP1 target genes specifically
modulated in the context of YAP1 amplification in cancer
cells, we filtered our YAP1-gene signature with the YAP1gene signature from two previous studies reporting
gene expression profiling in normal cellular contexts in
which YAP1 gene is ectopically overexpressed [15, 36].

Among the 427 significantly regulated genes that could
be compared across the three studies, we found that 88
are in common in our study and in at least one study
from the literature and 86/88 are concordantly (up- or
down-) co-regulated (9/9 genes concordantly regulated
in all analyses) (Figure 3a). Indeed, these genes represent
YAP1 targets modulated in multiple different normal and
tumor cell contexts. Additional 339 genes are uniquely
modulated in the 11q22-amplified cancer cell lines (Figure
3a and Supplemental Table 3). We functionally annotated
the filtered 339 gene-list using Ingenuity functional
annotation tool, revealing that they were mainly annotated
for cell proliferation and for cell movement ontologies
again suggesting that YAP1 overexpression positively
sustains these two biological functions (Figure 3b and
Supplemental Table 3), similar to the global 707 gene-list.

The validation of individual YAP1 target genes
identified by gene expression analysis was performed
using qPCR on independent silencing experiments. We
analyzed the modulation of CTGF gene [37], which
represents one of the few known YAP1 target genes, a
group of genes involved in cell cycle regulation (CCNA2,
CCNG1, CDK2, SKP2) [38-42]; the ITGA5 [43] and
NRG1 genes involved in cell-cell interaction; the genes
LATS2, NF2, STK3, STK4 and TEAD2, which are
components of the Hippo pathway [44]; GADD45A
gene which is involved in DNA repair [45]; VEGFA
gene involved in angiogenesis [46] and ETS1 which is a
transcription factor that acts as an oncogene via multiple
pathways [47]. The genes modulated in agreement with
the microarray data were 13 out of 16 in Ca-Ski and RO82
cell lines and 15 out of 16 in EKVX cell line (Figure 3c).
Among them, the SKP2 protein was validated by western
blotting on Ca-Ski, EKVX and RO82 cell lines revealing
that protein levels are modulated in agreement with the

microarray and qPCR results (Figure 3d).

YAP1 downregulation induces a moderate
reduction of cell proliferation and influences the
cell cycle.
Uncontrolled, aberrant cell proliferation is a
common characteristic of aggressive cancer cells [48].
Therefore, in order to evaluate whether YAP1 sustains
the cell proliferation, as suggested by gene expression
analyses, we investigated cell growth dynamics in 11q22amplified cancer cell lines, using the bulk cell populations
following sh-mediated stable silencing. As detected
by both SRB assay and cell counting, YAP1 silencing
induced a moderate reduction in cell proliferation in all
cell lines analyzed, which is statistically significant in CaSki cell line (Figure 4a). Concordantly, YAP1 silencing
correlated with a reduction in viable cell counting without

induction of cell death (Figure 4b). In addition, YAP1
silencing induced a modest reduction of the proliferative
cell compartment of cells in S phase of the cell cycle, as
demonstrated by BrdU incorporation assay (Figure 4c).
Notably, we detected a significant increase of the protein
levels of p21 and p27, which are implicated in the negative
regulation of cell-cycle [49, 50], in YAP1 silenced cells
compared to the off target cells in all YAP1-amplified
cancer cell lines (Figure 4d).

off target cells and in YAP1 stably silenced cells. YAP1
silencing induced a strong and significant reduction in the
number and size of colonies counted in all 11q22-amplified
cancer cell lines analyzed, compared to the control cells
(Figure 5a). Furthermore, subcutaneous injection of
stably infected Ca-Ski sh-off target and Ca-Ski sh-YAP1
cells into nude mice showed a significant reduction in
tumor volume in YAP1 silencing cells, providing a direct
evidence that reduction of anchorage-independent growth
correlated with significantly reduced in vivo cell expansion
of cancer cells (Figure 5b).

YAP1 downregulation strongly reduces the
tumorigenic phenotype.

YAP1 silencing affects cell migration in Ca-Ski
and in RO82 cell lines.

Normal cells typically are not able to grow and
form cell colonies in semisolid media because under these
conditions they undergo anoikis-mediated cell death. In
contrast, aggressive cancer cells acquire the capability
to grow without anchorage-dependence to the substrate,
within a semi-solid medium such as agar [51]. In order to
evaluate whether YAP1 positively affected the anchorageindependent growth we evaluated the colonies growth in

Active migration of tumor cells is a prerequisite for
tumor cell invasion and for metastasis development [52]
and our gene expression analyses indicated that YAP1
modulates several target genes that are reported to control
cell-cell contact and cell migration. To investigate if
migration activity is effectively affected by the modulation

of YAP1 expression, cell tracking analysis experiments
using video time-lapse microscopy were performed in CaSki and RO82 cell lines, while EKVX parental cell line
was uninformative as it is characterized by very limited
migration ability (not shown). In Ca-Ski and RO82 cell
lines the short-term YAP1 downregulation produced a
moderate reduction of cell migration as measured by the
distance covered by cells during 12 hours of observation,
compared to the control off-target cells (Figure 6a). The
phenomenon was qualitatively evident in RO82 cell
line also by wound healing assay (Figure 6b), further
supporting that the cell motility is reduced in YAP1
silenced cells. The same results were obtained using either
siRNA (Figure 6a-b) or shRNA (data not shown) cells.
Similarly, cell migration was reduced after short term
YAP1 silencing in chemotaxis assay (Figure 6c).

In Ca-Ski cell line, YAP1-silenced cells are
more sensitive to genotoxic stress induced by cisplatin
treatment, compared to control cells (Figure 7a). We
detected a statistically significant increase in annexin V
and 7AAD positivity in YAP1 silenced cells compared to
the off target cells, indicating that in these cells the DNA
damage induced a more prominent reduction of viability
and increased cell death (Figure 7b). Concordantly,
following DNA damage, we detected an increase in
caspase 8 and PARP protein activation, which are essential
mediators of the apoptosis process, in Ca-Ski YAP1
silenced cells compared to the control cells (Figure 7c). To

cervical carcinoma. Whether YAP1 copy amplification
event represents a marker of cervical cancer progression
and prognosis remains an intriguing but unexplored issue.
Genes mapping within amplicons are considered
as candidate oncogenes. Amplification is an important
mechanism for gene copy number gain, for protein
overexpression and sustained oncogene activation in
tumor cells. Most amplification events include a relatively
large region of DNA that contains several genes that
can be considered possible targets of the amplification
event. The 11q22 amplicons include, in addition to YAP1,
several genes which could be considered as possible
candidate oncogenes such as BIRC2 (cIAP1) and BIRC3
(cIAP2) encoding apoptosis inhibitor proteins. Evidences
reported that BIRC2 cooperates with YAP1 to accelerate
tumorigenesis and promote mouse liver carcinogenesis
[12]. In addition, several members of MMP gene family,
known to be involved in extracellular matrix remodeling,
in cell invasion and in metastasis development [53], have
been proposed as oncogene targets of the 11q22 amplicon
[54, 55]. Finally, progesterone receptor (PGR) is only 1
Mb proximal to YAP1 and its co-amplification may play a
role in female cancers. Therefore, the combined oncogenic
role of co-amplified genes within 11q22 cannot be ruled
out and remains a complex and fascinating issue to be
explored.
Interestingly, we found that five of the significantly
modulated genes identified as targets of YAP1 are
components of Hippo pathway (STK3/Mst2, STK4/Mst1,
LATS2, NF2 and TEAD2). Specifically, TEAD2, which is
a transcription factor that interacts with YAP1 to promote
the expression of the Hippo responsive genes [56] results
to be upregulated after YAP1 silencing. All the other
modulated genes represent negative growth regulators
acting in a kinase cascade that ultimately inactivates YAP1
and we revealed that they are downregulated upon YAP1
silencing. Therefore, considering that Hippo pathway is a
cascade of phosphorylation events which inhibits YAP1,
we can speculate that in YAP1-amplified cancer cell lines

a lesser extent, cisplatin induced an analogous effect also
in RO82 and EKVX cell lines (Supplemental Figure 2).

DISCUSSION
In this study we demonstrate that YAP1 effectively
supports multiple transformed properties in 11q22amplified cancer cell lines. In particular, in our
experiments, we exploited RNA interference strategies
to silence YAP1 in cancer cell lines (Ca-Ski, EKVX and
RO82) that carried 11q22 copy number amplification
and YAP1 overexpression and compared YAP1 silenced
cells and control cells for gene expression profiling, cell
proliferation tumorigenic potential, cell migration and
response to genotoxic stress.
Literature data report apparently conflicting results
on YAP1 role in carcinogenesis. In fact, YAP1 has been
reported to exhibit both oncogenic properties [12-15] and
tumor-suppressive functions [7, 9, 10] in distinct in vitro or
in vivo models. Our results provide definitive evidence that
endogenous YAP1 expression has oncogenic properties in
cancer cells carrying YAP1 gene amplification.
Several studies reported that the 11q22 locus is
amplified in human tumor samples [12, 17-29]. The
majority of the data published until now detected 11q22
amplification in different tumor types without directly
investigating the YAP1 copy alteration. We here provided
direct evidence of YAP1 copy amplification in up to 23% of
samples from multiple tumor types, providing compelling
evidence that it represents a cancer associated alteration
in a fraction of multiple tumor types. In particular, we
detected YAP1 copy amplification in 4/25 (16%) of
cervical cancer samples. Literature data reported 11q22
copy number amplification in cervical cancer samples [19,
25, 29], predominantly in patients with advanced stage of
the disease [25]. These evidences, together with our data
directly addressing YAP1 copy amplification, support that
YAP1 is the target of the amplification at 11q22 locus in

the transient YAP1 downregulation, by mimicking an
over-activation of Hippo pathway, induces a feedback
loop function on Hippo pathway components, that tends
to counterbalance the YAP1 silencing.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that in the
YAP1-amplified cancer cell lines under study the YAP1
gene effectively sustains multiple transformed traits,
indicating that YAP1 is a direct oncogenic target of the
11q22 amplicons. In addition, we directly detected that
YAP1 amplification is actually present in a variable but
significant fraction of carcinoma subtypes.

Paraffin sections of 21 human cervical cancer
samples, 15 human thyroid cancer samples, 56 human
CSN tumor samples and of 77 human non small cell lung
cancer samples were obtained from the Departments of
Pathology of collaborating centers (Treviso General
Hospital, Italy; “Fondazione Pascale” of Naples, Italy;
“Fondazione Istituto Nazionale Tumori” of Milan, Italy).

Protein expression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

For western blotting, 40 ug of protein lysates were
used as described [57]. Antibodies used and conditions
are listed in Supplemental Table 4. Protein expression
was analyzed using Odyssey infrared imaging system
(Li-Cor) and the data were normalized on siOT and on
shOT. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antiYAP1 antibody diluted 1:25 (Cell Signaling, 4912) using
Ultra vision detection system (LabVision), upon heatinduced epitope retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase was
blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30
minutes. Intensity scoring of tumor cells was performed
by pathologist based on a 4-tiered scale. The comparisons
between two classes were performed by Fisher two tailed
extract test by grouping negative/1+ cases and 2+/3+
cases.

Cancer cell lines.
Ca-Ski and EKVX cell lines were purchased from
ATCC, RO82 cell line from Interlab Cell Line Collection,
Genova, Italy (ICLC). Ca-Ski and EKVX were grown
in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS (Lonza), RO82 cell line was grown
in DMEM (Sigma), Ham’s F12 (Lonza), MCDB 105
(Sigma) (2:1:1) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS (Lonza), in a humidified incubator at 37°C and
5% CO2 (Thermo Electron Corporation). Cell identity
was monitored by microsatellite typing and absence of
mycoplasma contamination was checked regularly.
For stable YAP1 silencing experiments, short-hairpin
RNA (shRNA) expression vectors were used targeting
YAP1 (shY1 SH-012200-02-10, shY2 SH-012200-0310, Thermo Scientific) or an off-target sequence (shOT,
s-004000-02, Thermo Scientific) as negative control. Cells
were infected with MOI 5-10 in the presence of Polybrene
(4 ug/mL), cells were selected using puromycin 72 hours
post infection and bulk cell population was collected and
screened for YAP1 expression.
For transient YAP1 silencing, cells were transfected
using the Dharmafect Transfection Reagent (Thermo
Scientific) and small-interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting
YAP1 (siYAP1) (AM16708A-107951, AM16708A-107952,
AM16708A-114602, Ambion) and an off-target sequence
as negative control (siOT, AM4611 Ambion).
In order to establish Ca-Ski xenograft, cells (106)
were injected subcutaneously into the each flank of sixweek-old immunocompromised athymic nude mice
(Harlan). Tumor size was monitored weekly. Tumor
volume was calculated using the formula 1/2r3. Animal
experimentation was approved by Institutional IRB and
performed according to National laws. The data showed
the means and the s.e.m of three independent experiments,
each composed of 4 mice per experimental condition. Two
classes’ comparisons with multiple measurement points
have been performed by two-way analysis of variance.

Anchorage-independent growth.
Cells (105) were resuspended in 0.35% agar
complete medium and seeded on 0.5% bottom agar
medium in 60 mm dish. After two weeks, plates were
stained with iodonitrotetrazolium violet (1mg/ml, Sigma)
and clones were counted at the microscope (Olympus).
The data showed the means and the s.e.m of three
independent experiments. The comparisons between two
classes were performed by two sample unpaired t-test.

Cell proliferation assay.
Cell proliferation was assessed by cell counting
using an automated cell counter (Bigital Bio) and by
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as described [58]. The
comparisons between two classes were performed by
two-sample unpaired t-test. Cisplatin (Teva) was added
24 hours post- plating at the indicated concentrations. The
data showed the means and the s.e.m of three independent
experiments. The comparisons between two classes
were performed by two-sample paired t-test. The IC50
(concentration of drug inhibiting 50% of cell growth) was
calculated applying non-linear fitting dose response.

number status using relative quantification method with
standard curves. The RNaseP gene (RNaseP, 4401631
Applied Biosystem) was used as a reference gene. Real
time PCR data were analyzed by the SDS software 2.3,
in order to obtain the Ct and the standard deviation. In
each experiment, standard curves were analyzed for both
reference gene (RNaseP) and target gene using serial
diluitions of a normal control DNA. Using the standard
curves of reference gene and target gene, the mean Ct of
individual samples were converted to nanogram equivalent
of template DNA. The obtained values were converted to
target gene copy number by normalizing over a normal
donor DNA as calibrator.

Cells (1x105) were plated in 6-well plate and
treated with cisplatin (Teva) 100 uM for 16 hours. The
data were acquired and analyzed using Guava instrument
(Millipore). The data showed the means and the s.e.m of
three independent experiments. The comparisons between
two classes were performed by two-sample paired t-test.

Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay.
BrdU Flow Kit (BD Pharmingen) was used to
quantify cells that were actively synthesizing DNA. Cells
were pulsed with 1 (Ca-Ski and RO82) or 2 (EKVX) hours
of BrdU incorporation, washed and released for additional
1 hour in complete medium. Stained cells were measured
and analyzed with flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). The
data showed the means and the s.e.m of three independent
experiments. The comparisons between two classes were
performed by two-sample paired t-test.

Wound healing assay.
Exponentially growing cells (8x105) were plated in
60 mm dish. Cell monolayer was scratched using a pipette
tip. Complete medium was added after washing in PBS,
wound closure was monitored every 24 hours and pictures
were taken by bright-field microscopy (Olympus).

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

Time-lapse video microscopy.

FISH analyses were performed on cells smeared
over a positively charged slide and on human non small
cell lung cancer samples that were arrayed on a tissue
microarray. BAC DNA probes used for FISH were
extracted using QIAprep Midiprep (Qiagen), verified by
sequence tagged site content mapping and labeled with
Spectrum Orange deoxyuridine triphosphate or Spectrum
Green deoxyuridine triphosphate (Vysis, Downers Grove,
IL) by use of a Nick Translation Kit (Vysis) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The FISH hybridization
signals were analyzed in an Olympus BX51 microscope
coupled to a charge-coupled device camera COHU 4912
(Olympus). The images captured were analyzed using the
Mac Probe software (PowerGene Olympus). A minimum
of 100 nuclei were counted.

Cells (3×103) were plated in 24-well plate. After
overnight cell adhesion, cells were incubated at 37°C in
5% CO2 atmosphere in the Leica Time Lapse AF6000LX
workstation equipped with the Leica DMI 6000 motorized
microscope and an environmental chamber for the proper
setting of temperature humidity and CO2 concentration.
The allows the acquisition of the Images were collected
every 5 minutes for 12 hours using AF6000 Software
(Leica) and were analyzed with IM2000 software (Leica),
to obtain the total distance covered (micron) by the
cells. The data showed the means and the s.e.m of three
independent experiments. The comparisons between two
classes were performed by two-sample paired t-test.

Chemotaxis experiments.

Real-time PCR.

Transwell permeable supports, 6.5 mm diameter
inserts, 8.0 um pore size, polycarbonate membranes
(Corning Inc.) were used to perform migration assay.
Cells (105) were seeded in the upper chamber of the
transwell insert in serum-free medium (Sigma). The
lower chamber of the transwell was filled with 600 uL of
culture medium containing 10% of fetal bovine serum.
Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 16 h, then
transwells were removed and stained with 0.1% Crystal
Violet (Sigma) in 25% methanol. Non-migrated cells were
scraped off the top of the transwell with a cotton swab.
Migrated cells were quantified by eluting crystal violet
with 1% SDS and reading the absorbance at 550 nm using
the microplate reader Infinite 200 (TECAN). The data

Total RNA was extracted using EZ1 RNA cell mini
kit (Qiagen) on a Bio-Robot EZ1 (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions and 500 ng of RNA was
retro-transcribed using Super Script III RT (Invitrogen)
with random primers. Relative quantification of gene
expression was performed in triplicate using TaqMan
assays on Demand on a ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence
Detection System (Applera) by comparative Ct method,
using the HPRT gene (HPRT PDAR, 4326321E) (Applied

YAP1 target genes in 11q22-amplified cancer
cell lines were analyzed by gene expression profiling
experiments. Class comparison analysis performed using
the BRB Array Tool software from the US National
Cancer Institute (linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html)
and comparing YAP1 proficient cells versus YAP1-silenced
cells. Differential expression levels of individual probe
sets were considered statistically significant if p <0.001
by random variance t tests. A multivariate permutation
test was applied to provide 90% confidence that the
false discovery rate was less than 10%. Such stringent
significance threshold was used to limit the number of
false-positive findings. The statistically significantly
modulated genes identified were functionally annotated
using Ingenuity bioinformatic tool.
The analysis of YAP1 copy number (deletion
or amplification) status in independent datasets was
performed using Oncomine (www.oncomine.org)
and Sanger Centre (www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/
CellLines) database repositories, two cancer microarray
databases which contain gene copy number data
collected from the literature and proprietary datasets. The
comparison between YAP1 deletion and amplification was
performed in order to test the null hypothesis that the two
anomalies are expected at the same frequency by Chisquare test.
