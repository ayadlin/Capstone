Abstract
This prospective observational study evaluated the efficacy and safety of
long-term decitabine treatment in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Decitabine 20 mg/m2/day was administered intravenously for 5 consecutive days
every 4 weeks to MDS patients in intermediate-1 or higher International Prognostic
Scoring System (IPSS) risk categories. Active antimicrobial prophylaxis was given to
prevent infectious complications. Overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS),
progression-free survival (PFS), and time to response were evaluated, as were adverse
events. The final analysis included 132 patients. IPSS risk was intermediate-2/high in
34.9% patients. The patients received a median of 5 cycles, with responders receiving
a median of 8 cycles (range, 2-30). ORR was 62.9% (complete response [CR], 36;
partial response [PR], 3; marrow complete response [mCR], 19; and hematologic
improvement, 25). Among responders, 39% showed first response at cycle 3 or later.
OS at 2 years was 60.9%, with 17% progressing to acute myeloid leukemia. PFS at

2 years was 51.0%. Patients achieving mCR showed comparable survival outcomes
to those with CR/PR. With active antibiotic prophylaxis, febrile neutropenia events
occurred in 61 of 1,033 (6%) cycles. Long-term decitabine treatment with antibiotic
prophylaxis showed favorable outcomes in MDS patients, and mCR predicted favorable
survival outcomes.

INTRODUCTION

PATIENTS AND METHODs

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of
bone marrow disorders manifesting as cytopenias resulting
from ineffective hematopoiesis and progressively evolving
to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Supportive treatment
has long been the mainstay of treatment for a majority
of patients, with allogeneic stem cell transplantation
performed when available. DNA hypermethylation
leading to inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes is the
main pathobiologic mechanism in MDS [1-3], and the
introduction of demethylating agents has changed the
treatment paradigm of MDS.
Decitabine (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine) reverses
aberrant DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands
by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, resulting in
reactivation of previously silenced tumor-suppressor
genes [4]. Although decitabine as single-agent therapy
failed to demonstrate overall survival (OS) benefit in
contrast to azacitidine [5, 6], the United States Food and
Drug Administration (US FDA) approved decitabine for
the treatment of MDS, considering its comparable efficacy
to azacitidine. Decitabine therapy has shown favorable
treatment outcomes, with overall improvement rates of
42%-73% in previous studies [7-10]. Longer treatment
duration may lead to better survival outcomes. A recent
analysis from the AZA 001 trial showed that even patients
with stable disease (SD) retained a survival benefit with
azacitidine treatment and that late response could occur
in one-third of patients with SD in earlier cycles [11].
Thus, continuation of treatment until disease progression
is generally recommended. In previous studies, frequent,
early treatment discontinuations, mainly due to febrile
neutropenia and cytopenia-related infections, may have
prevented patients from achieving the best clinical benefit
of demethylating agents. A retrospective study showed
a significant decrease in febrile episodes in patients
receiving antibiotic prophylaxis [12]. We performed a
multicenter, prospective observational study to determine
whether long-term decitabine treatment with antibiotic
prophylaxis and proper dose/schedule modification
yielded better clinical outcomes in patients with MDS.

Patients
The study included adult patients (≥20 years) with
MDS of any WHO subtype or chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia, an IPSS score of 0.5 or more, and naïve to
treatment with demethylating agents. Patients were
excluded if they were allergic to decitabine, were pregnant
or lactating, had progressed to AML (≥20% blasts), or
had concurrent malignancy. Patients with active viral
or bacterial infections were not included until complete
recovery. This study was reviewed and approved by the
institutional review board of each participating center, and
all patients provided written informed consent. The study
was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01400633).

Treatments
Decitabine was administered according to the 5-day
intravenous outpatient schedule used in the ADOPT
trial [8]. Patients received 5 consecutive injections of
decitabine 20 mg/m2/day over 1 hour every 4 weeks.
Dose modification and delay of cycles were allowed per
protocol guidelines when patients experienced severe
adverse effects. Subsequent cycles could be delivered if
the absolute neutrophil count was >500/mm3 and platelet
count was >30,000/mm3. Treatment was delayed until
recovery from non-hematological toxicities, such as
serum creatinine >2 mg/dL, serum glutamate-pyruvate
transaminase or total bilirubin >2× upper normal limit,
or active or uncontrolled infections. Active antibiotic
prophylaxis was recommended to prevent infectious
complications, especially in the first 4 cycles. Supportive
measures, including antiemetics, transfusion, and growth
factors, were allowed if needed. Continuation of decitabine
treatment was recommended for at least 4 cycles, until
progression or unacceptable AEs occurred.

Study end points
The primary end point of this study was the ORR,
calculated as the sum of CR, PR, mCR, and HI. Secondary
end points were OS, PFS, and time to response. Patients
were followed-up for survival every 12 weeks until death.
Response was evaluated by central review according to
the modified IWG 2006 response criteria [14]. Treatment

Bone marrow biopsy was recommended at every 2 cycles,
at the end of treatment, and when disease progression or
recurrence was suspected.

first. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan‑Meier
method, and log-rank tests were used to compare the OS
distribution by variables (best treatment response type
and achievement of mCR). Time to first response and
time to best response were analyzed with frequency and
descriptive statistics (median, min-max) in each treatment
cycle. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess
the efficacy of decitabine post hoc within subgroups
defined by the following baseline characteristics, which
were determined to have effects on ORR: age (≥65, <65),
gender, period of MDS (≥ 1 year, <1 year), WHO subtype,
French-American-British (FAB) subtype, IPSS category,
and karyotype. Safety was analyzed in all patients who
received at least one dose of decitabine. All P-values were
two-sided and statistical significance was accepted at the
level of P<0.05.

Safety evaluation
Physical examination, complete blood count, and
chemistry were performed at baseline and the first day
of each cycle before initiation of treatment. The end of
treatment evaluation was conducted 56 ± 7 days after the
last dose of decitabine. AEs were evaluated based on the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) ver. 4.0.

Statistical analysis

RESULTS

We analyzed the ORR, OS, PFS, and time to
response in the FAS population, which comprised
patients who met all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria,
had a baseline assessment, received at least 2 cycles of
decitabine treatment, and had at least one valid postbaseline clinical response assessment. ORR was defined
as the proportion of patients with CR, mCR, PR, and HI
as the best response based on central review employing
the IWG 2006 response criteria Confidence intervals for
ORR were estimated with the Clopper-Pearson formula.
OS was defined as the time from the start of decitabine
treatment to death; data on survivors were censored at the
last follow-up. PFS was defined as the time from the date
of first decitabine administration to progression, relapse
after showing CR or PR, or death, whichever occurred

Patient characteristics
The study was conducted at 33 centers in Korea
from December 2010 to October 2011. Of the 158 patients
enrolled, 2 patients were excluded from the safety analysis
for non-initiation of the study drug (decitabine), and 24
patients were excluded from the full analysis set (FAS)
for not meeting inclusion criteria (3 patients), dropout
before 2 cycles (5 patients), and not undergoing response
evaluation (16 patients). Thus, 132 patients were included
in the FAS (Figure 1). Their median age was 63 years
(range, 20-82 years), and a majority of the patients were

male (57.6%). The median duration of disease was 19 days
(range, 1-3,011 days). Patients were categorized according
to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) into
intermediate-1 (Int-1; 65%), intermediate-2 (Int-2; 27%),
and high (7.6%) risk groups. Five patients had secondary
MDS. At the baseline evaluation, karyotype was good in
75 patients (57%), intermediate in 27 (20%), and poor in
22 (17%); karyotyping data was unavailable in 8 patients.

HI was 2 (range, 1-13). Cytogenetic response was noted in
19 of 55 patients (34.6%; CR, 25.5% and PR, 9.1%) with
abnormalities at baseline. Progression to AML was 10.8%

3 or more cycles and 47% receiving 6 or more cycles. The
median number of cycles among responders was 8 (range,
2-30 cycles). The mean interval between cycles was 36.8
± 9.4 days. Dose modification was required in 8 patients.
At the time of analysis, 7 patients remained adherent to the
treatment. Reasons for treatment discontinuation included
failure to achieve response (11%), progression (8%),
adverse events (AEs; 7%), proceeding to hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT; 26%), progression to
AML (13%), progression after achieving response (5%),
patient decision (11% ), death (12%), and loss to followup loss or other reasons (7%). Prophylactic antimicrobial
agents were administered to 86% patients, including
antibacterials (aminopenicillin or quinolone) to 83.3%,
antifungals (fluconazole or itraconazole) to 77%, and
antivirals (acyclovir) to 28%.
The overall response rate (ORR) was 62.9% (95%
CI, 54.0%-71.1%): complete response (CR), 27.3%; partial
response (PR), 2.3%; marrow complete response (mCR),
14.4%; and hematologic improvement (HI), 18.9%. Initial
response was achieved within 2 cycles in 61% patients;
however, 39% patients showed initial response at cycle
3 or later (31% at cycles 3 and 4; Figure 2A). The best
response peaked at cycle 4 (28%; Figure 2B). HI was
observed in 44.4% patients (erythroid response [HI-E],

Survival data
The median follow-up duration was 9.5 months.
Among 132 patients in FAS, fifty-nine (44.7%) patients
died during the treatment (16.7%) or follow-up period
(28%). Causes of death were disease progression (24%),
AEs (20%), and other reasons (56%). Other reasons of
death included pneumonia in 10 patients and sepsis/septic
shock in 6 patients.
The 1-year and 2-year OS was 80.9% (95% CI,
72.9%-86.8%) and 60.9% (95% CI, 51.3%-69.1%),
respectively. The progression free survival (PFS) rate
was 70.0% (95% CI, 61.1%-77.2%) at 1 year and 51%

better OS at 1 year (88.8% vs. 66.7%, P=0.0035) and 2
years (70.6% vs. 42.5%, P=0.0014) than those who did
not achieve response (nonresponders; Figure 3B). Patients
who achieved mCR showed comparable survival with
those achieved CR or PR, regardless of HI (Figure 3C).
Patients who achieved HI showed better survival than
those who did not. This was statistically significant in the
higher risk IPSS groups (INT-2 and high), but not in the
lower risk group.

The safety analysis included 156 patients. Febrile
neutropenia was the most common AE, considered to
be possibly related to the study drug in 23.7% patients.
Febrile neutropenia events occurred in 61 of 1,033 (6%)
cycles in 37 patients in the FAS. Grade III or more
AEs included neutropenia (21.2%), anemia (12.8%),
thrombocytopenia (15.4%), and febrile neutropenia

patients with MDS. In previous studies, the primary cause
of early discontinuation of decitabine treatment, other
than treatment failure, was cytopenia-related infections.
Therefore, to prevent early dropout, all patients in this
study were to receive antibacterial prophylaxis as well
as dose and schedule modification if they experienced
cytopenias at the first cycle. This led to a reduction in
febrile neutropenia events to 6% (62 of 1,033 cycles) in
contrast to 11%-14% reported with the same treatment
schedule in previous studies [8, 9]. This translated into
a decrease in early discontinuation rates (84% patients

clear explanation for this observation. However, the
median cycle duration was 35 days in our study, which
is significantly longer than in previous studies. The lower
early dose intensity in our study than in the other studies
may explain the difference. However, the ORR in our
study was not inferior to those in other studies. As shown
in previous studies, the number of treatment cycles is a
significant factor determining the effect of demethylating
agents [5, 6, 10]. Thus, prolonged administration of
decitabine is required for the treatment of MDS. In
addition, considering that a significant number of patients
respond to decitabine only after 3 or more cycles,
effectiveness of decitabine therapy should be assessed
after completion of at least 4 cycles, especially in patients
showing SD in earlier cycles. This finding was supported
by a recent analysis of the AZA 001 trial [11].
The major difference between the AZA-001 and
GMDSSG/EORTC 06011 trials was the median number
of treatment cycles (9 vs. 4) [5, 6]. In addition, the M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center study comparing 3 decitabine
schedules showed that a high dose-intensity schedule
induces more favorable responses [10]. To maximize
the treatment outcomes of demethylating agents, both
dose-intensity and treatment cycles are important.
Thus, prevention of early drop-out and continuation of
decitabine treatment until failure is recommended.
In conclusion, long-term decitabine treatment
was effective for Int-1 or higher risk patients with
MDS, with an acceptable toxicity profile. Appropriate
antibacterial prophylaxis was effective in reducing early
febrile neutropenia events. Patients with mCR showed
comparable survival to those with CR/PR, and mCR can
be considered a favorable response to decitabine treatment.

received at least 3 cycles) and increase in the median
number of cycles.
Overall treatment outcomes in this study compare
favorably with those from previous studies using the
5-day outpatient protocol [8-10]. The CR and ORR in
this study were somewhat higher than those in the DIVA
study [9]. This could be attributed mainly to the patient
characteristics, with our study including more IPSS
Int-1 patients than previous studies. Furthermore, most
patients were newly diagnosed and were treatment naive.
Only 5 patients with secondary MDS were included. In
addition, 47% patients received at least 6 cycles, with
the responders receiving a median of 8 cycles. Baseline
cytogenetic data was available for 94% patients. Of the
55 patients with cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline,
19 patients (35%) showed cytogenetic response (14 CR
and 5 PR). Interestingly, the response rate to decitabine
was inferior in patients with an intermediate karyotype as
compared to patients with good or poor risk cytogenetics.
Thus, decitabine may have better effects on clones with
more cytogenetic/genetic alterations.
The clinical significance of mCR remains unclear.
In previous studies, 15%-23% decitabine-treated patients
showed mCR [5, 9, 10]. The 14% patients who achieved
mCR in our study showed comparable survival outcomes
with the CR/PR patients regardless of HI status. mCR
seems to be an analogue of CR with incomplete blood
count recovery (CRi) in AML, reflecting a low tumor
burden but with decreased marrow function. Because
normal hematopoiesis is suppressed in MDS, it is natural
that a substantial proportion of patients show mCR
after successful treatment with demethylating agents.
In a retrospective analysis, patients with mCR showed
comparable outcomes to those with CR after HSCT [13].
In the present study, patients who achieved mCR showed
favorable survival outcomes regardless of HSCT status.
However, this finding is discordant with a previous study,
where patients achieving mCR showed inferior survival
outcomes compared to those with CR or PR [9]. Further
studies are required to clarify this effect.
HI was a significant predictor of OS in the DIVA
study [9]. This finding was confirmed in our study. As in
the DIVA study [9], HI was associated with better survival
in higher risk patients (IPSS INT-2 or high), but not in
lower risk patients (INT-1). Recently, an analysis of higher
risk patients treated with azacitidine showed that patients
who achieved HI without response (CR or PR) also
experienced a survival benefit (hazard ratio 0.19; 95% CI,
0.08-0.46; P<0.001) [11]. Thus, HI could be accepted as
a predictor of better survival in higher risk MDS patients
treated with demethylating agents.
In previous studies, response to demethylating
agents was observed early in the course of treatment,
usually within 2 cycles [5, 6, 9, 10]. In our study,
however, a higher proportion of patients (37.6%) showed
first response only at cycle 3 or later. We do not have a
