BACKGROUND: Relationships between clinical researchers and industry are becoming increasingly complex. The frequency and impact of conflicts of interest in the full range of high-impact, published clinical
cancer research is unknown. METHODS: The authors reviewed cancer research published in 8 journals in
2006 to determine frequency of self-reported conflicts of interest, source of study funding, and other characteristics. They assessed associations between the likelihood of conflicts of interest and other characteristics by using chi-squared testing. They also compared the likelihood of positive outcome in randomized
trials with and without conflicts of interest by chi-squared testing. RESULTS: The authors identified 1534
original oncology studies; 29% had conflicts of interest (including industrial funding) and 17% declared
industrial funding. Conflicts of interest varied by discipline (P < .001), continental origin (P < .001), and sex
(P < .001) of the corresponding author and were most likely in articles with corresponding authors from
departments of medical oncology (45%), those from North America (33%), and those with male first and
senior authors (37%). Frequency of conflicts also varied considerably depending upon disease site studied.
Studies with industrial funding were more likely to focus on treatment (62% vs 36%; P < .001), and randomized trials that assessed survival were more likely to report positive survival outcomes when a conflict of interest was present (P ¼ .04). CONCLUSIONS: Conflicts of interest characterize a substantial minority of
clinical cancer research published in high-impact journals. Therefore, attempts to disentangle the cancer
research effort from industry merit further attention, and journals should embrace both rigorous standards

In recent years, relationships between clinical researchers and industry have become increasingly complex.
Researchers may not only rely upon industry for study funding1,2 but may also receive consulting fees,
own stock, and hold leadership positions within organizations that profit from selling the very drugs and
devices that are the subjects of researchers’ investigations.3,4
Several studies have suggested that industry-sponsored studies tend to reach conclusions favorable to
the sponsor5-16 and to use study designs more likely to favor the sponsored intervention than studies

without industrial sponsorship.8,13,16,17 Studies have also
indicated that ties to industry may influence the nature,
focus, and dissemination of research undertaken by
researchers with those ties.1,2,18 Concerned by these findings, medical journals have increasingly implemented policies that require researchers to disclose potential conflicts
of interest.19-21
Although previous studies have sought to define the
frequency of conflicts of interest among scientific and
medical researchers, many of these estimates are already
dated, and few have focused upon cancer research specifically. A recent study found that the majority of clinical trials of systemic anticancer and supportive care drugs
reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2005
declared conflicts of interest.22 Yet the broader epidemiology of conflicts of interest in current, published oncology
literature remains unexplored. It is quite possible that
studies considering diagnostic tests, technologies, and surgical interventions may differ substantially from trials of
pharmacologic agents. Therefore, the impact of the
‘‘industrialization of clinical research’’ upon the field of
oncology merits further attention.23 This is particularly
important in light of changes in political priorities that
made the competition for scarce federal research funds
increasingly intense, potentially fueling an even greater
reliance upon private sources in recent years.
Therefore, in this study, we sought to characterize in
greater detail the sources of funding for the clinical cancer
research recently published in high-impact medical journals, to examine the frequency and nature of conflicts of
interest declared, and to consider possible associations
between conflicts of interest and investigator characteristics, disease site, study focus, and study outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion Criteria
This study focuses upon research published in 2006 in
selected, high-impact, English-language journals. Journals
were selected after consideration of journal impact factors,
citation half-life, and readership. Only journals that primarily publish original, clinical oncology research were
included; journals that focus upon reviews or basic science
investigation alone were excluded. Three journals catalogued by the Thomson ISI Journal Citation Index as gen2784

eral medical journals were included as follows: the New
England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, the Journal of the
American Medical Association, and the Lancet. Five journals catalogued as oncology journals were included: the
Journal of Clinical Oncology, the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute, the Lancet Oncology, Clinical Cancer
Research, and Cancer. All articles listed as original investigations were reviewed (in Clinical Cancer Research, only
articles under the subheading ‘‘Cancer Therapy: Clinical’’
were included); special articles, editorials, and review
articles were excluded. Original investigations that were
published in the general medical journals were reviewed
to determine whether their subjects were oncology.

Coding
All original oncology articles identified in this manner
were then analyzed to determine certain objective attributes: cancer type and/or site, declared source(s) of funding
and conflicts of interest, author affiliations, and sex of the
primary and senior (final) authors. The sex of the author
was determined by inspection of the author’s name; for
names in which sex was ambiguous, internet searches were
used in an attempt to determine sex, as described elsewhere.24 The articles were also subjectively coded for
study type (prospective clinical vs other) and focus of
research (epidemiology, prevention, risk factors for incidence, screening, or diagnostic methods; treatment with
curative intent, or treatment with palliative intent).
Data were entered by 2 medical-student coders into
a Microsoft Access database (N.S. and S.A.; Microsoft,
Redmond, Wash). The senior investigator (R.J.) closely
supervised the coding process, including a personal review
of 100 articles coded by each of the 2 medical-student
coders to improve accuracy and consistency in the coding
process. In order further to ensure inter-rater reliability,
10% of the articles, distributed across all included journals, were assessed independently by both coders. All discrepancies in this subset were analyzed further to
determine the nature and frequency of coding disagreements for each item. Discrepancies were resolved by the
consensus of 2 additional individuals (A.M. and R.J.),
and overall error rates for each item were thus determined.
For all objective attributes assessed, error rates were less
than 5%. For the coding categories on study type and
focus, which required subjective assessment on the part of
Cancer

the coders, we formally assessed the level of interobserver
agreement. For classification of the study as a prospective
clinical oncology study versus other type of study, the 2
coders were found to agree in 89% of the cases in the overlapped sample. This corresponded to a kappa of 0.74, indicative of good interobserver agreement.25 For the
classification of the major focus of the study as epidemiology, prevention, risk factors for incidence, screening, or
diagnostic methods, the 2 coders agreed in 77% of cases,
with a kappa of 0.53, indicative of fair interobserver agreement. For the classification of the major focus of the study
as treatment with curative intent, the 2 coders agreed in
84% of cases, with a kappa of 0.63, indicative of good
interobserver agreement. For the classification of the
major focus of the study as treatment with palliative
intent, the 2 coders agreed in 99% of cases. Given the
infrequency of this classification, kappa is an inappropriate measure of interobserver agreement and was not
calculated.
All randomized clinical trials were further examined to assess the authors’ subjective interpretation of
outcome, and for studies in which overall survival was
assessed, to determine an objective measure of outcome
based upon the statistical significance of survival impact.
The randomized studies identified in the initial coding
phase were printed for subsequent blinded coding of
outcomes. Sections containing author names and affiliations were blacked out, and all articles were physically
cut after the last sentence of the conclusions to blind
reviewers as to whether a conflict of interest disclosure
was made. All randomized trials were coded for outcomes by 2 blinded coders who had not reviewed the
papers in the initial coding phase. Authors’ subjective
interpretations were graded qualitatively as positive (presenting the intervention arm as preferable to the control
arm), neutral, or negative (presenting the control arm as
preferable to the intervention arm). Overall survival was
assessed quantitatively, with a positive result defined as a
significant (P < .05) survival difference in favor of the
intervention, positive trend (P  .10) toward significance in favor of the intervention, neutral as no significant difference between the 2 arms, negative trend (P 
.10) toward significance in favor of the control arm, and
negative as a significant (P < .05) survival difference in
favor of the control arm. Discrepancies between the 2
blinded coders were resolved by blinded consensus.

Analysis
For the purposes of analysis, a conflict of interest was
defined to be present when a conflict of interest was explicitly declared by the authors, when an author was an
employee of industry at the time of publication, or when
the study reported industry as the funding source. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS version 14.0
software (SPSS, Chicago, Ill). Chi-squared testing was
used to determine the significance of associations between
industrial funding or conflict of interest and disease site,
author characteristics, and study type and focus. Because
all applicable articles published in the selected journals
during the chosen year were reviewed, the cases in our
database constitute the entire universe of applicable data
points; therefore, these estimates are exact and contain no
statistical uncertainty.

RESULTS
We identified 2701 original articles published in the
selected journals in the year 2006, of which 1534 were
oncology studies.
Table 1 details the sources of funding and frequency
of conflicts of interest declared in the research articles
studied, by journal. Overall, 29% of the papers had conflicts of interest, and 17% declared industrial funding.
As shown in Figure 1, there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of studies that declared
industrial funding (P < .001) or that had any conflicts of
interest (P < .001) by study discipline, as defined by the
department of the corresponding author. Studies that had
a corresponding author from a medical oncology department or division were most likely to have conflicts (45%),
and studies from diagnostic radiology were least likely to
have conflicts (4%).
Table 2 presents funding sources and frequency of
conflicts of interest by disease type and/or site studied,
revealing considerable variability in the frequency of conflicts of interest (P ¼ .02) and likelihood of industrial
funding (P ¼ .001) between different cancer types and/or
sites.
There was also a statistically significant association
between geography and frequency of industrial funding
and conflicts of interest. Of the 965 studies with authors
based in North America, 19% declared industrial funding, compared with 17% of the 405 studies from Europe,

2% of the 117 studies from Asia, and 21% of the 47 studies from elsewhere (P < .001). Conflicts of interest were
observed in 33% of the North American studies, 27% of
the European studies, 5% of the Asian studies, and 40%
of the studies from other locations (P < .001).
Sex of the first and senior authors was determined in
1505 articles. In these articles, 33% of the first authors
and 20% of the senior authors were female. Articles with a
woman as first or senior author were less likely to be
funded by industry (13% vs 23%; P < .001) or to have
conflicts of interest (24% vs 37%), but these articles were
more likely to have any source of funding declared (76%
vs 68%; P < .001), when compared with studies in which
both first and senior authors were men.
The types of conflicts of interest in the examined
articles are described in Figure 2. Most frequent was
industrial funding of the study (present in 17% of
articles), followed by participation in authorship by an
employee of industry (present in 12% of articles).
Among the 261 industry-funded studies, 62% had a
major focus upon treatment with curative intent. This was
significantly higher than the proportion among studies
not funded by industry (36%; P < .001). Few studies,
funded by industry or not, had a major focus upon treatment with palliative intent, but the proportion of industry-funded studies with this focus was higher than the
proportion of studies not reporting industrial funding
(5% vs 2%; P ¼ .002). Industry-funded studies were less
likely than those not declaring industrial funding to focus
upon epidemiology, prevention, risk factors for incidence,
screening, or diagnostic methods (20% vs 47%; P <
.001).

FIGURE 1. This figure depicts the frequency of conflicts of interest (including industrial funding) declared by articles with
corresponding authors from different departmental and divisional affiliations.

Of the 661 prospective clinical studies identified in
our dataset, 211 (32%) were industry-funded, and 312
(47%) had a conflict of interest. The majority (81%) of
the industry-funded studies were prospective clinical studies, whereas only 35% of studies that did not declare
industrial funding were prospective clinical studies (P <
.001).
Table 3 presents the results of the blinded outcomes
analysis of the 124 randomized trials identified in the
sample. Among studies that reported overall survival,
those studies with conflicts of interest were more likely to
have positive findings (P ¼ .04). There was no observed
difference in the likelihood that the author interpretation
was positive nor in the likelihood that the author interpretation was more positive than the objective assessment of
effect on overall survival. No significant differences were
observed between studies reporting industrial funding

blinded outcomes assessed.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have found that conflicts of interest characterize a substantial minority of the clinically oriented
cancer research published in high-impact medical journals. Conflicts of interest were most likely in articles with
corresponding authors from departments of medical oncology, those from North America, and those with male
first and senior authors, and the frequency of conflicts varied considerably depending upon disease site studied.
Articles that reported industrial funding were more likely
to have a focus on treatment than were studies that did
not report such funding, and randomized trials with a
conflict of interest were more likely to report positive survival outcomes.
Our work complements other studies that have
sought to illuminate the frequency, nature, and effects of
conflicts of interest in modern clinical oncology research.
Hampson and colleagues recently examined the conflict
of interest disclosure forms submitted by authors of
abstracts presented at the 2004 and 2005 annual meetings
of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.26 They
found that 23.8% of the abstracts in 2004 and 17.0% in
2005 disclosed research funding, and 23% of the abstracts
in those 2 years had at least 1 author who disclosed a personal financial interest. They also found that almost 20%
of abstracts had at least 1 author who was employed by or
played a leadership role in a commercial entity. Our findCancer

ings provide a complementary perspective on these
important issues. After all, although certain abstracts—
particularly those presented in plenary sessions—may be
quite influential, abstracts are primarily intended to present preliminary findings and do not always result in peerreviewed publications, which are the primary means by
which research findings influence practice.27 Therefore, it
is useful also to consider the sources of funding and nature
of conflicts disclosed in the clinical studies that have
achieved publication in high-impact journals.28 Our findings that 12% of articles had authors who were employees
of industry and that 17% were funded by industry provide
a useful complement to the insights yielded by the work
of Hampson et al.
Other researchers have previously examined the
published cancer-research literature for conflicts of interest and funding sources. Tuech and colleagues29 characterized the sources of sponsorship and competing
financial interests disclosed in 655 cancer randomized trials published from 1999-2003 in 12 international

journals and found that 227 trials disclosed industrial
funding. Riechelmann and colleagues examined conflicts
of interests disclosed in 289 clinical trials and 43 editorials
that considered systemic anticancer agents and supportive-care drugs published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2005 and found conflicts in 69% of the trials.22
The higher rates of conflicts observed in those studies are
consistent with the observation in the current study that
prospective studies and studies conducted by medical
oncologists are more likely to have conflicts of interest.
Our study, thus, complements those studies by considering a larger selection of study types in more detailed fashion (including a differentiation between governmental
and private philanthropic funders) in a more recent year,
as well as by analyzing the distribution of funding sources
by disease site and author sex.
Finally, the current study adds to the literature that
has explored correlations between industrial funding and
positive study outcome. Several previous studies have
examined the relation between funding sources and outcomes of published clinical trials. These prior studies
include a seminal analysis of 107 controlled clinical trials,
which found that a substantially higher proportion of
studies favoring new therapies were funded by industry
than the proportion of studies favoring traditional therapies that were funded by industry.6 Since then, several
other studies have explored this issue in greater
detail,5,7,8,16,30-34 including several that have focused
2788

upon specific medical specialties, such as cardiology,35
psychiatry,36,37 gastroenterology,38 and orthopedics.13,39-41
In general, these studies have also found that industryfunded studies are more likely to have positive study outcomes than those conducted without industrial funding,
although some have failed to identify a relation between
funding source and trial outcome.42 Relatively little work
of this nature has explored the oncology literature. A small
but influential study examined 44 cost-effectiveness studies of new drugs in oncology, documenting that industrysponsored studies were less likely to report unfavorable
qualitative conclusions concerning the cost or cost effectiveness of the drugs than nonprofit-sponsored studies.11,43 More recently, another study examined 150
health-economics studies within the field of oncology and
found that industry-sponsored studies were more likely to
be cost-minimization studies and more likely to draw positive qualitative conclusions about costs than those supported by nonprofit organizations.44 Another recent
study of breast-cancer clinical trials found that of 56 studies published in the year 2003, those that reported an
involvement with a pharmaceutical corporation were
more likely to report positive conclusions.45
Similarly, we find among the randomized trials that
assessed survival in our sample, those studies with conflicts
of interest were more likely to report positive outcomes.
However, because we did not find a higher rate of discordantly positive author interpretations of outcome in the
Cancer

June 15, 2009

Conflicts of Interest in Cancer Research/Jagsi et al

studies with conflicts of interest, we do not believe that
the reason underlying this observed difference is simply
interpretation or a tendency for studies with conflicts of
interest to focus upon outcomes other than overall survival. Another potential mechanism is publication bias46;
author groups with conflicts of interest may be even more
likely to publish positive results (or less likely to publish
negative results) than others. These findings are also consistent with the suggestion that studies supported by
industry are more likely to use study designs that are more
likely to yield positive results (such as trials with a placebo
rather than active controls).8,47
The primary limitation of this study is that our data
rely upon self-reports by authors of any relevant funding
sources and potential conflicts of interest. We did not validate these self-reports by obtaining personal financial
information from the authors or by querying corporate
board membership or employee lists. Recent news reports
reveal that authors may not always openly disclose relevant conflicts. Furthermore, we are able only to ascertain
the prevalence of those conflicts that were published, and
it is possible that some journals might not have published
all conflicts that were reported. This is most likely to lead
to some degree of underestimation of the prevalence of
these conflicts, although it is also possible that some
authors may over-report potential conflicts where none
exist. Some of the associations observed in the current
study may result from systematic differences in the likelihood of disclosing conflicts of interest rather than differences in rates of actually existing conflicts, particularly in
the face of differing journal policies48-54 and differing cultural norms. Another potential limitation arises from the
focus upon 8 high-impact journals, most of which are
published in the United States. Journals published in
other countries may differ meaningfully, and future studies should seek to characterize the frequency, nature, and
associations of conflicts of interest as reported in those
journals. Nevertheless, we believe this study to present 1
of the most complete and updated analyses of the frequency, nature, and effects of conflicts of interest in clinical cancer research in existing literature.
In summary, the current study suggests that a substantial minority of the broad range of modern, highimpact, published, clinical cancer research is open to the
influence of conflicts of interest. Certain study characteristics, including discipline, national origin, and author
Cancer

June 15, 2009

sex, are correlated with the likelihood of conflict. The frequency of conflicts varies by cancer site and/or type studied, and studies with conflicts of interest are more likely to
focus upon treatment rather than diagnosis and prevention. Most disturbingly, it appears that cancer research
studies in which conflicts of interest are present are indeed
more likely to report positive outcomes. In light of these
findings, attempts to disentangle the cancer-research
effort from industry ties merit further attention, and medical journals should be supported in embracing both rigorous standards of disclosure and heightened scrutiny when
conflicts exist.
