BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated a 3-week schedule of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG). METHODS: Patients received bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks and were evaluated every 6 weeks
until tumor progression. Tissue correlates were used to quantify tumor content of vascular endothelial growth factor
A (VEGFA) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2). RESULTS: Of 61 patients who were treated
(35 men and 26 women; median age, 52 years; age range, 21-78 years), 50 patients had glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM), and 11 patients had anaplastic glioma (AG). The median number of previous chemotherapies was 2 (range, 1-5
previous chemotherapies), and 16 patients had received 3 previous chemotherapies. The median number of bevacizumab doses was 4 (range, 1-20 doses), and 45% of patients received >5 doses. The toxicities observed were primarily grade 1 and 2, and the most common were fatigue, hypertension, and headache. One grade 2 intratumoral bleed
and 1 bowel perforation were reported. For patients with GBM, the 6-month progression-free survival rate was 25%,
the median time to tumor progression was 10.8 weeks, and the median overall survival was 25.6 weeks. The best
response included a partial response in 15 patients (24.5%) and stable disease in 31 patients (50.8%) patients; radiographic recurrence patterns included increased changes in fluid attenuation inversion recovery (24%) and multifocal
recurrence (20%). The median survival after bevacizumab failure was 10 weeks. The ratio of tumor VEGFA/VEGFR2
was increased in patients aged >55 years; an increased VEGFA/VEGFR2 ratio was correlated nonsignificantly with
decreased survival (P ¼ .052). CONCLUSIONS: An every-3-week schedule of bevacizumab had antitumor activity and
was relatively nontoxic for patients with recurrent HGG. The predictive value of VEGFA/VEGFR2 in tumor will require

The median survival for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is approximately 14.6 months

for those who receive radiotherapy and concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ).1 In patients who have recurrent
GBM, treatment outcomes are poor; the median time to tumor progression (TTP) is 9 weeks, and the median survival is
25 weeks.2 Progression-free survival (PFS) is correlated with overall survival (OS) and has become the benchmark for
assessing treatment efficacy in patients with recurrent GBM, in whom the 6-month PFS (PFS6) rate ranges between 9%
and 15%.2-4
Angiogenesis is a critical process in the progression of gliomas that is regulated by multiple proangiogenic and antiangiogenic cellular factors.5 One of the main determinants of angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
which is secreted by glioma cells to induce the tumor vascularization that facilitates growth.6,7 High expression of VEGF

is correlated with poor clinical outcome, and it has been
demonstrated that inhibition of VEGF decreases the
growth of glioma cell lines.8,9 High-grade gliomas
(HGG) with a high degree of VEGF expression and vessel
density respond best to antiangiogenic therapy.9,10
Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, South San
Francisco, Calif) is a humanized monoclonal antibody
that binds VEGF, thereby preventing the interaction of
VEGF with its receptors VEGFR1 (fms-like tyrosine
kinase receptor 1 [Flt-1]) and VEGFR2 (kinase insert
domain receptor [KDR]). The activity of bevacizumab
alone or in combination with irinotecan for recurrent
HGG has been investigated and has produced response
rates that range from 35% to 60% and PFS6 rates of
40% to 60% (Table 1).11-22 The current study was a prospective phase 2 trial of single-agent bevacizumab for the
treatment of patients with recurrent HGG on an every3-week schedule to assess PFS, OS, and safety. In addition, outcomes based on VEGFA and VEGFR2 tumor
expression were assessed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All patients signed an institutional review board-approved
consent for study participation. Patients with histologically proven HGG (GBM, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma [AA], anaplastic oligodendronglioma [AO], or
anaplastic oligoastrocytoma [AOA]) were eligible if their
tumors were recurrent or progressive. Surgery (reresection) before enrollment was permitted but required a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study at least 4 weeks
before and after treatment. Evaluable or measurable disease after reresection was not mandated. A stable dose of
steroids for >5 days was required before imaging.
Patients must have failed on previous radiotherapy
and TMZ and must have recovered from the toxic effects
of any previous therapy (4 weeks after previous cytotoxic
or biologic therapies, 6 weeks after nitrosoureas, and
1 week after noncytotoxic agents). If patients underwent
interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery,
then confirmation of progressive disease based on imaging
studies or pathology was required. Patients were aged
18 years and had a life expectancy >8 weeks and a
Karnofsky performance status >60. Adequate bone marrow
function (white blood cells >3000/lL, absolute neutrophil
count >1500/mm3, platelet count >100,000/mm3, and
hemoglobin >10 mg/dL), liver function (alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels <3 times the upper limit of normal and bilirubin level <1.5 times the upper limit of

5298

normal), and renal function (creatinine <1.5 mg/dL) were
required before starting therapy. A urine protein:creatinine
(UPC) ratio 1.0 at screening or a urine dipstick for proteinuria 2þ was required. These tests had to be performed
within 14 days before registration.
Patients may not have had any significant medical
illnesses, including uncontrolled hypertension, active vascular disease, bleeding, and intestinal perforation that
could not be controlled adequately with appropriate therapy or that would compromise the patient’s ability to tolerate bevacizumab (including inability to comply with
study and/or follow-up procedures). Known human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients who were receiving antiretroviral therapy were ineligible as were patients
who had a history of any other cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) unless
they were in complete remission and had been off all therapy for >3 years. Patients could not be pregnant or breast
feeding and had to practice adequate contraception.
Treatment
All patients received bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every
3 weeks, and a cycle was defined as 6 weeks. Delays
were allowed for drug-related toxicities for up to
6 weeks between doses; then, patients were removed
from the study, but no dose reductions were allowed.
All toxicities were scored based on version 3.0 of the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(CTC).
Assessments
All patients underwent baseline physical examination, laboratory testing, and contrast brain MRI with or without
perfusion imaging. A physical examination and urine dip
stick test were done every 3 weeks. MRI studies, a complete blood count with platelets, a complete chemistry
panel, the UPC ratio, and a physical examination were
done every 6 weeks. Clinical and radiographic response
(or progression) was assessed using the Macdonald criteria23 but was modified to include progressive fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) changes as progression
of disease. All MRI scans were rereviewed (by J.J.R., S.G.,
and M.C.C.) to evaluate for patterns of recurrence, ie,
multifocal or diffuse (or worsening) infiltration on FLAIR
sequence.12,17,24,25 Multifocal recurrence was defined as
new sites of contrast-enhanced tumor remote from the
original site without an obvious connection observed on
FLAIR sequences, whereas diffuse infiltration was defined
as the progression of nonenhancing tumor, which lead to

discontinuation from the trial. In consenting patients, tumor tissue was collected for correlative studies.
Correlative Studies: In Situ Proximity Ligation
Assay
VEGFA and VEGFR2 protein levels were measured in tumor samples using a proximity ligation assay (PLA).26-28
Hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections were analyzed to identify a tumor-rich region that was used to
create a tissue microarray. For sample pretreatment, a
4-l-thick tissue microarray section was deparaffinized
and epitope-retrieved in citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (DBS,
Pleasanton, Calif) under pressurized boiling for 5 minutes.
Slides were permeabilized with a 0.1% Triton X-100 solution and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline. The Duolink
procedure (Duolink PLA Kit; Olink, Uppsala, Sweden)
was followed according to the manufacturer’s directions.
Respective slides were incubated with 2 ng/lL rabbit antiVEGFA and 2 ng/lL goat anti-Flk-1 (VEGFR2; both
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif) at
4 C overnight. Glass coverslips (No. 1: VWR International, West Chester, Pa) were mounted on samples with
Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories,
Inc., Burlingame, Calif). For image acquisition and analysis, samples were observed using an Axiovert 200 M standard fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY)
with a 120 Watt short arc lamp, excitation and emission
filters appropriate for the detection of dye 563 (red, PLA
signals) and Hoechst 33342 (nuclear) staining, and a 40
objective (Pan-Neofluar; Zeiss). Images were captured
using an Axiocam HRc (Zeiss) and the accompanying
Axiovision 4.5 software (Zeiss). For quantification of protein, images were converted to 8-bit grayscale TIF images
and analyzed using BlobFinder software version 3.0 (available at: www.cb.uu.se/amin/BlobFinder accessed in January 2010) to provide the total number of PLA (single
protein) signals and the total number of nuclei using average signal count analysis after optimization and standardization of nucleus size, blob size, blob intensity, and
cytoplasm radius.
Statistical Analyses
PFS6 was the primary endpoint of the study. KaplanMeier product-limit survival curves were used to estimate
PFS6 and its 95% confidence interval (CI). In total, 50
patients with GBM were accrued, and the estimated PFS6
for GBM was of primary interest. The historic and comparative PFS6 was 15% based on Wong et al.2 Treating
50 patients with GBM had 80% power to detect a PFS6

5300

of 15% versus 31% with a 1-tailed 3% Type I error rate.
PFS, OS, and the time from progression to death were
estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves, which were compared between subgroups using the log-rank test. P values
<.05 were considered statistically significant.
The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to evaluate
the correlation of VEGFA and VEGFR2 protein expression with age. Linear regression analysis was used to assess
the relation between VEGFA and VEGFR2 protein
expression. Scatter plots and locally weighted least-squares
(LOWESS) smoothing were used to confirm the suitability of linear regression analyses, and statistical significance
of the VEGFA-VEGFR2 relation was assessed according
to the P value for the estimated slope of the regression
line. Proportional hazards regression analyses were performed with OS as the dependent variable and with
VEGFA/VEGFR2 ratio and age as the predictors of interest. The proportional hazards assumption was tested using
interactions of the predictor variables with time.

RESULTS
Patient Response
Sixty-one patients were enrolled (35 men and 26 women),
their median age was 52 years (range, 21-78 years), and
the median Karnofsky performance status 80% (range,
70%-100%). With regard to histology, 50 patients had
GBM, 7 patients had AA, 3 patients had AO, and 1
patient had AOA. The median number of previous chemotherapies was 2 (range, 1-5 previous chemotherapies),
and 16 patients had received 3 previous chemotherapies. Ten patients (16.4%) underwent reresection before
starting bevacizumab. Twelve patients also underwent
previous radiosurgery, and 1 patient received repeat external-beam radiation therapy. In all but 1 patient, tumor recurrence either was confirmed histologically (n ¼ 4), by
MR perfusion and MR spectroscopy (n ¼ 6), or by positron emission tomography (n ¼ 1), or the recurrence was
outside the radiosurgery field (n ¼ 1).
Patients received a median of 4 doses of bevacizumab (range, 1-20 doses), and 45% of patients received 5
doses. Four patients who had continued on treatment
were censored for failure 6 weeks earlier, because a rereview of MRI studies revealed an earlier progression date.
At a median follow-up of 6.8 months (range, 1-29.9
months), 52 patients had died (all but 1 from tumor progression), 9 patients remained alive, and all but 4 patients
had progressed. The most common toxicities were fatigue
(63%), hypertension (21%), and headache (20%). Toxicities grade 3 (Table 2) were observed in 11 patients

grade 2 central nervous system hemorrhage, and 1 patient
was removed for bowel perforation.
The PFS6 was 31%, the median TTP was 3.3
months, the median OS was 7.1 months, and the 6month OS rate was 57%. For patients with GBM (50 of
61 patients; 82% of all patients), the PFS6 rate was 25%,
the median TTP was 2.8 months; the median OS was 6.5
months, and the 6-month OS rate was 54%. For patients
who underwent repeat surgery (n ¼ 10; 7 patients with
GBM, 2 patients with AA, and 1 patient with AO) compared with patients who did not (n ¼ 51), the median
PFS was 4.1 months versus 3.3 months (P ¼ .21), and the
OS was 12.9 months versus 6.8 months (P ¼ .09). When
PFS, TTP, and survival were assessed according to the
number of previous chemotherapies for patients with
GBM, trends were observed toward decreased PFS (8% vs
31%; P ¼ .006), decreased median TTP (2.3 months vs
3.7 months; P ¼ .006), and decreased survival (5.1
months vs 7.4 months; P ¼ .01) if patients had received
>2 previous chemotherapies versus 2 previous chemotherapies. The median survival was 2.5 months after failure on bevacizumab for all patients and only for patients
with GBM. The median number of chemotherapies after
bevacizumab was 0 (range, 0-4 chemotherapies). The
time to death after failure on bevacizumab for patients
who received >4 doses versus 4 doses was 3.4 months
versus 2.0 months, respectively (P ¼ .18). Age alone did
not have a significant impact on survival.
The best response was a partial response in 15
patients (24.5%), 31 patients (50.8%) had stable disease,
and 15 patients (24.5%) manifested progressive disease,
including 2 patients who had no MRI confirmation but
had evidence of clinical deterioration. Patterns of recurrence on MRI were assessed in 59 patients; there were 14
patients (24%) with increasing FLAIR changes and 12
patients (20%) with multifocal recurrence, 2 of whom
had worsening multifocal disease; and 7 patients had both
of these imaging findings (12%). Reasons for study re-

moval not caused by tumor progression or clinical decline
(n ¼ 10; 16.5%) included (in 1 patient each) a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus, grade 4 fatigue, pancreatitis caused by comorbid medical issues, tumor
progression that (in retrospect) was ischemic and related
changes on MRI, grade 2 intratumoral bleed, rectal bleeding, and stroke (not drug related). In addition, 3 patients
refused further treatment.
VEGF Ligand-to-Receptor Protein Expression
Associated With Patient Age and Survival
A proximity ligation assay was used to study the expression of VEGFA and VEGFR2 in 25 patients (21 patients
with GBM, 2 patients with AA, and 2 patients with AO).
Twenty-two patients had tissue available from an initial
or previous surgery, and 3 patients had tissue available
from before bevacizumab treatment. PLA analysis demonstrated substantial variation in VEGFA (279.6-fold) and
VEGFR2 (91.2-fold) protein abundance in the tumors
(Fig. 1). Linear regression analysis revealed a significant
relation between VEGFA and VEGFR2 (P ¼ .00005)
(Fig. 2). Neither VEGFA expression nor VEGFR2 expression differed significantly between patients aged >55
years (n ¼ 13) versus patients aged <55 years (n ¼ 12;
P ¼ .05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). However, there was a
significant difference in the VEGFA/VEGF2R ratio for
patients aged <55 years versus patients aged >55 years
(P ¼ .008; Wilcoxon rank-sum test); on average, patients
aged >55 years had a 2.2-fold higher expression ratio
(Fig. 3). In a Cox proportional-hazard regression, the
VEGFA/VEGF2R ratio demonstrated a nonsignificant
trend in survival among 21 patients with GBM independent of patient age (HR, 2.23; 95%-CI, 0.99-5.01; P ¼
.052) (Fig. 4), such that patients who had tumors with a
high VEGFA/VEGF2R expression ratio had relatively
unfavorable outcomes.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first prospective phase
2 trial of single-agent bevacizumab administered on an every-3-week schedule. Our PFS6 rate of 25% in patients
with recurrent GBM was better than the historically
reported PFS6 rates of 9% to 15%2,3 and was comparable
to the PFS6 rate of 21% reported in patients with recurrent GBM who received TMZ29 but did not meet statistical success. The median OS for patients with recurrent
GBM was 6.5 months but increased to 7.5 months if
patients who had received 3 previous chemotherapies

were not considered; a demonstration that heavily pretreated patients have a worse outcome. Our response rate
of 24.5% was comparable to recent data.15,25 It is noteworthy that a high VEGFA/VEGFR2 ratio demonstrated
a nonsignificant trend toward decreased survival.
The reported PFS6 rates from prospective and retrospective studies using bevacizumab to treat recurrent
GBM or AG are comparable to that reported in the current study notwithstanding differences in patient populations (Table 1).11-14,16-22 Only 3 large trials used
bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) as a single agent every 2 weeks in
patients with GBM,15,21,25 whereas all others used combination therapy and added either irinotecan or carboplatin.
The role of bevacizumab is less well established in AG,
although activity has been observed.13,16,17,19,20,30 Kreisl
et al used single-agent bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) every 2
weeks in 48 patients with recurrent GBM and reported a
response rate of 35% according to Macdonald criteria.25
The PFS6 rate was 29%, and the median TTP was 4
months. The 6-month OS rate was 57%, and the median
OS was 7.75 months. In a noncomparator, randomized
phase 2 study comparing bevacizumab with or without

irinotecan; the response rates were 28.2% for single-agent
bevacizumab and 37.8% for combination therapy with
irinotecan; the PFS6 rates were 42.6% and 50.3%, respectively, and the median OS was 9.2 months for bevacizumab alone and 8.7 months for combination therapy.15
The 2 arms were comparable for PFS6 and OS, but the
trial was not powered for formal statistical comparisons.
These results confirm the effectiveness of single-agent bevacizumab, and there does not appear to be a strong rationale for the addition of irinotecan. Currently, the best and
most effective partner (chemotherapy or a targeted agent)
for bevacizumab is not defined for patients with recurrent
HGG. The most obvious benefits of omitting irinotecan
are a decrease in systemic toxicity and a reduction in treatment costs.
A 3-week, single-agent bevacizumab schedule was
chosen in part to minimize patient visits but with the recognition that the optimal dose and schedule of bevacizumab for recurrent HGG remains unknown. In 2 other
reports, investigators reported that a schedule of 5 mg/kg
every other week had similar antiglioma activity but less
vascular toxicity, ie, bleeding or thrombotic events,16,18

and 2 other trials noted no difference in outcome measures when comparing a 2-week or 3-week schedule of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) and irinotecan in a subset of
patients.14,30 On the basis of the current prospective
study, a 3-week, single-agent bevacizumab schedule does
not appear to be less effective and is associated with toxicities similar to what has been reported previously.11-21
The worrisome complication of intracranial hemorrhage
is rare (range, 1%-5%).11-21
After failure on bevacizumab, patients had a median
survival of 2.5 months despite salvage therapy and regardless of tumor grade. Similar results have been reported
previously with survival after failure of bevacizumab ranging from 1 months to 4.25 months.12,18,24,25 Changes or
the addition of chemotherapeutic agents either with or
without bevacizumab appear to have a minimal impact on
survival, but maintaining patients on bevacizumab may
prevent an acute increase in peritumoral edema.12,1821,24,25
We did not note a difference in survival after bevacizumab failure whether patients were early failures or late

Figure 4. This plot illustrates the ratio of vascular endothelial
growth factor A (VEGFA) versus vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) protein expression (vertical axis)
versus survival time (horizontal axis). Open circles indicate
patients who remained alive at the end of follow-up; solid
circles, patients who had died at the end of follow-up. There
was a trend for patients with higher ratios to have shorter
survival (P ¼ .052).

that nearly all patients who continued on bevacizumab
plus a new chemotherapy agent after initial failure on bevacizumab had an increase in FLAIR/T2 changes on MRI
studies. These novel MRI changes to antiangiogenic therapy have led in part to a rigorous reassessment and a proposal of new response criteria for brain tumors.32
Our protein analysis of VEGFA and VEGFR2
revealed that an increased ligand-to-receptor ratio is correlated with decreased survival independent of patient age,
although this correlation did not reach significance. It is
hypothesized that a higher ligand-to-receptor ratio may
indicate relatively increased or more persistent VEGFR
activation. Alternatively, an elevated ratio may reflect low
VEGFR2 expression, suggesting that this is not a primary
mechanism of tumorigenesis in these tumors. One limitation of our current analysis is that all but 3 patients had
tissues analyzed from an earlier time point (surgery at diagnosis), so the tissues that were analyzed may not have
been the same biologically at the time of bevacizumab
treatment. A second limitation is the small number of
samples that were evaluated. It is possible that VEGF
ligand and VEGFR increase as tumors recur, so that the
extent of VEGFA and VEGFR2 expression may have
been undescored.33 Unlike the findings of Nghiemphu et
al,18 in which greater activation of VEGFA was observed
in patients aged >55 years and VEGFA expression was
1.4 times greater in that group, the current results did not
indicate increased VEGFA in older patients but did reveal
an increased VEGF/VEGFR2 ratio with increased age.

Sathornsumetee et al10 report a higher response rate in
patients with increased VEGF expression in tissue, but
this had no correlation with survival. Kreisl et al25
observed that, for patients aged >53 years, the median
PFS was 7.5 months compared with 2.75 in younger
patients. Similarly Nghiemphu et al18 reported better
PFS6 and OS rates for patients aged >55 years compared
with a control group of patients who did not receive bevacizumab. The current findings may reflect differences in
analytic methodology or in the molecular substrates that
were analyzed (transcript vs protein).
In conclusion, single-agent bevacizumab on an every-3-week schedule appears to have anti-GBM efficacy
similar to that achieved on an every-2-week schedule with
comparable toxicity. Our data are comparable to data
from single-agent, every-2-week bevacizumab schedules
for recurrent HGG; however, a randomized trial will be
required to determine the optimal bevacizumab schedule.
It appears that the VEGFA/VEFGR2 ratio may be predictive of survival; however this needs to be validated in a
larger patient cohort and, if confirmed, may be an important factor in deciding which patients with HGG will benefit from bevacizumab treatment.
