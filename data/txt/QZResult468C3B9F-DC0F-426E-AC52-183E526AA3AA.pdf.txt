ABSTRACT
Gain-of-function of the androgen receptor (AR) and activation of PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway have been demonstrated to correlate with progression to castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, inhibition of AR or PI3K/mTOR alone
results in a reciprocal feedback activation. Therefore, we hypothesized that dual
inhibition of the AR and PI3K/mTOR pathway might lead to a synergistic inhibition of
cell growth and overcome drug resistance in CRPC. Here, we reported that androgendepletion increased AR protein level and Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 in
LNCaP cells. Moreover, we developed resistance cell lines of LNCaP to Enzalutamide
(or MDV3100), an AR inhibitor (named as LNCaP ‘MDV-R’) and PF-04691502, a PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor (named as LNCaP ‘PF-R’). MTS analysis showed that LNCaP ‘PF-R’ was
strongly resistant to Enzalutamide treatment, and on the other hand, LNCaP ‘MDV-R’
was 6-fold resistant to PF-04691502 treatment. Mechanistically, LNCaP ‘MDV-R’ cells
had significantly reduced AR, loss of PSA and increase Akt activity in contrast with
LNCaP ‘PF-R’ cells. Combined inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and AR pathways with a variety
of small molecular inhibitors led to a synergistic suppression of cell proliferation and
a profound increase of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in both androgen-dependent
LNCaP and independent CRPC 22Rv1 cell lines. In conclusion, this study provides
preclinical proof-of-concept that the combination of a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor with an AR
inhibitor results in a synergistic anti-tumor response in non-CRPC and CRPC models.

androgen receptor (AR) mutations, AR or its co-regulator
proteins overexpression, intraprostatic androgen synthesis
up-regulation and gene fusions have been proposed to
result in CRPC progression, which suggests AR signaling
remains a critical factor for the growth and survival of the
hormone-refractory prostate cancer [7–15].
In addition to AR signaling, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway is associated with prostate cancer. Uncontrolled
activation of PI3K-signaling pathway through loss of
PTEN has been found in about 40% of primary and
70% of metastatic prostate cancers [16–18]. Recently it
was demonstrated that there is a bidirectional crosstalk
between PI3K and AR survival pathways in PTENnegative prostate cancers [19]. Inhibition of the PI3K

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the number one incidence of
cancer with 233,000 new cases and the second leading
cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the United States
[1]. Androgen-deprivation therapy is initially effective,
but this therapy eventually fails and the disease progresses
to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) [2–4].
Patients with CRPC have poor survival rates due to
limited effective therapies. Despite recent phase III
trials showing a survival advantage for abiraterone
acetate (17α-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase inhibitor) and
enzalutamide (AR inhibitor), the median duration of
response is < 1 year [5, 6]. Several mechanisms including

pathway stimulates up-stream HER2/3 resulting in
activation of the AR, whereas blockade of AR reduces
FKBP5 levels impairing PHLPP function leading to
upregulation of pAKT. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway
alone causes growth arrest but not significant tumor
regression in Pten-negative prostate cancers, however,
combined PI3K and AR pathway inhibition gives
profound tumor regressions. It has been reported
that AZD5363, an AKT inhibitor potently inhibited
proliferation and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer
cell lines expressing the AR and had anticancer activity
in vivo in androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant
phases of a LNCaP xenograft model [20]. However, the
effect of castration-resistant tumor growth inhibition and
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) stabilization was transient
and resistance occurred after approximately 30 days of
treatment. Mechanistically, they found that single agent
AZD5363 induced increase of AR binding to androgen
response element, AR transcriptional activity, and ARdependent genes such as PSA and NKX3.1 expression.
These effects were overcome by the combination of
AZD5363 with the antiandrogen bicalutamide, resulting
in synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation and induction
of apoptosis in vitro, and prolongation of tumor growth
inhibition and PSA stabilization in CRPC in vivo.
In this study, we demonstrated that androgendepletion increases AR expression and Akt activity.
Further, we generated resistance cell lines of LNCaP to
Enzalutamide (MDV3100) (LNCaP ‘MDV-R’), an AR
inhibitor and PF-04691502 (LNCaP ‘PF-R’), a potent,
selective pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. MTS analysis
showed that LNCaP ‘PF-R’ was strongly resistant to

Enzalutamide  however LNCaP ‘MDV-R’ was 6-fold
resistant to PF-04691502. Mechanistically, we observed
PI3K/Akt and AR pathway is activated in LNCaP
‘MDV-R’ and LNCaP ‘PF-R’, respectively. Combination
targeting of PI3K/mTOR and AR pathways with a variety
of small molecular inhibitors led to synergistic suppression
of proliferation in both androgen-dependent LNCaP and
independent 22Rv1 cell lines with increased apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest. Together, this study provided a preclinical
proof-of-concept that combination of a PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor with an AR inhibitor resulted in an anti-tumor
activity in both non-CRPC and CRPC models.

RESULTS
Androgen depletion increases AR protein level
and Akt phosphorylation
AR inhibitor resistance acquired in prostate
cancer is associated with increased AR expression and
PI3K/Akt activity. To further evaluate this observation,
we grew LNCaP, an androgen-dependent cell line in
androgen-depleted medium, phenol red-free RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS for
10 days. Compared to LNCaP cells cultured in regular
medium and serum, androgen depletion significantly
resulted in increased AR protein and Akt phosphorylation
at Ser473 and Thr308 (Fig. 1). These data suggest AR
over-expression and Akt activity play important roles in
resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate
cancer.

FBS for 10 days. Cells were lyzed and 50 μg total protein was resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Immunoblotting was
performed using AR and phospho-Akt antibodies, respectively. β-actin protein was used as a loading control.

were resistant to PF-04691502 (Fig. 2A). Consistent
with this observation, loss of AR expression, loss of
PSA and activation of Akt signaling were identified
in  LNCaP ‘MDV-R’ but the opposite effect was seen in
LNCaP ‘PF-R’ (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate the
existence of a reciprocal feedback activation pathway

prostate cancer.

pathway is suppressed. To examine apoptosis, LNCaP
cells were treated with 10 μM of Enzalutamide or 0.2 μM
of PF-04691502 or 10 μM of Enzalutamide combined
with 0.2 μM of PF-04691502 for 72 hours, stained
with Annexin V and PI and evaluated by flow cytometry.
PF-04691502 but not Enzalutamide induced apoptosis
in LNCaP cells (Fig. 5A). However, apoptosis was more
prominent with combination treatment (Fig. 5A). These
results were confirmed by demonstrating an increased
level of cleaved PARP in both LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells
(Fig. 5B). Enzalutamide did not induce PARP cleavage,
however, PF-04691502 alone led to PARP cleavage and
combination of Enzalutamide and PF-04691502 resulted
in additional PARP cleavage. In summary, dual targeting
of PI3K/mTOR and AR resulted in synergistic inhibition
of cell proliferation and significant induction of apoptosis
in castration-sensitive LNCaP and castration-resistant
22Rv1 and VCaP cell lines.

Suppression of PI3K/mTOR inhibits cell
proliferation in AR inhibitor sensitive and
resistant prostate cancer cell lines
The PI3K pathway plays a central role in cancer cell
survival and proliferation across a variety of malignancies
and has been validated as a drug target for cancer therapy
[21, 22]. To examine whether suppression of PI3K pathway
inhibits prostate cancer cells, MTS assays were performed
to evaluate the growth in LNCaP, 22Rv1 and VCaP cell
lines. First, we evaluated two drugs, Enzalutamide and
Abiraterone and found that the IC50 of Enzalutamide and
Abiraterone were 0.27 μM and 10.49 μM in LNCaP cells,
20.27 μM and 25.47 μM in 22Rv1 cells, and unreached
IC50 and 30.32 μM in VCaP cells, indicating LNCaP cells
were sensitive to AR inhibition but 22Rv1 and VCaP were
not (Fig. 3A and Table 1). However, except LY294002, the
other three PI3K/mTOR inhibitors GDC-0980, GDC-0941
and PF-04691502 effectively inhibited the growth of these
three cell lines with IC50 values of 0.06 μM to 0.43 μM
(Fig. 3A and Table 1). Moreover, to determine whether
these inhibitors specifically inhibited the PI3K pathway,
we treated LNCaP cells with a representative drug
PF-04691502. Immunoblotting showed complete
suppression downstream of PI3K/mTOR, including Akt,
S6 and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 3B). Together, the data demonstrate
that blockage of PI3K/mTOR pathway successfully
suppress cell proliferation in both AR sensitive and nonsensitive prostate cancer cell lines.

AR inhibitor and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
induced G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest in
prostate cancer cells
Activation of the AR or PI3K pathway regulates
cell cycle progression. To examine cell cycle progression
affected by the AR or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in prostate
cancer cells, LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells were treated with
10  μM of Enzalutamide or 0.2 μM of PF-04691502
or 10 μM of Enzalutamide combined with 0.2 μM
of PF-04691502 for 48 hours and DNA content was
evaluated using flow cytometry (Fig. 6). Treatment with
Enzalutamide dramatically increased G0/G1 and decreased
S phase populations in both cell lines. However, treatment
with PF-04691502 induced G2/M arrest and also reduced
S populations. Similarly, combination treatment induced
G2/M arrest in LNCaP cells and continued to reduce
S phase in both of cell lines. These effects may contribute
to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis
by AR and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in these cells.

Dual inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and AR
pathways led to synergistic suppression of
proliferation and increased apoptosis in
LNCaP and castration-resistant 22Rv1 and
VCaP cell lines

DISCUSSION
Patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) have poor survival rates due to limited effective
therapies. Gain-of-function of the androgen receptor (AR)
and activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
correlate with progression to castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC). However, as single agents, AR or PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors result in a reciprocal feedback activation
loop. Therefore, combination of a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
with an AR inhibitor might result in a more profound
suppression of CRPC. In this study, we demonstrated that
acute depletion of androgen increased AR expression and
Akt activity in LNCaP cells. Further, chronic inhibition of
AR by Enzalutamide (MDV3100) resulted in a decrease

Since inhibition of the AR pathway results in
activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by reciprocal
feedback activation, we hypothesized that dual inhibition
of PI3K/mTOR and AR has synergistic inhibition of
cell proliferation and may overcome drug resistance. As
expected, a variety of combinations of PI3K/mTOR and
AR inhibitors resulted in synergism or strong synergism
of inhibition of cell viability in not only LNCaP, but also
in CRPC cell lines 22Rv1 and VCaP (Fig. 4 and Table 2).
It is known that apoptosis is induced when the PI3K

of AR protein level and loss of AR activity implicated
by a markedly reduced PSA expression, increased Akt
phosphorylation, and resistance to AR and PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors. On the other hand, chronic inhibition of PI3K/
mTOR pathway by PF-04691502, a potent, selective
pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor resulted in suppression of
Akt activation, increased AR and PSA expression, and
robust resistance to Enzalutamide. Inhibition of PI3K/
mTOR but not AR alone suppressed cell proliferation in
CRPC cell lines 22Rv1 and VCaP. However, combination
of PI3K/mTOR and AR led to synergistic suppression of
proliferation and induction of further apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest.
It has been reported that inhibition of the PI3K
pathway increased AR protein levels and its target gene
activity in PTEN-negative prostate cancers. Conversely,
blockade of AR resulted in activation of PI3K. Combined

PI3K and AR pathway inhibition gave profound tumor

It is also reported that the AKT inhibitor AZD5363
potently inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis
in prostate cancer cell lines and has anticancer activity

phases of the LNCaP xenograft model. However, the
effect of castration-resistant tumor growth inhibition
and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) stabilization is
transient and resistance occurs with increasing PSA after
approximately 30 days of treatment. The combination of
AZD5363 with the antiandrogen bicalutamide results in
synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation and induction
of apoptosis in vitro, and prolongation of tumor growth
inhibition and PSA stabilization in CRPC in vivo [20].
Consistent with these reports, our results support the
combined inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and AR to represent

a novel therapeutic strategy that warrants clinical trial
evaluation in patients with CRPC. Currently there are two
clinical trials investigating PI3Kβ inhibitor GSK2636771
(NCT02215096) and pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
LY3023414 (NCT02407054) in combination with
enzalutamide in metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer patients.
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is frequently
activated and plays a central role in tumorigenesis across
a variety of malignancies [21, 22]. It is upregulated and
has been implicated in the survival and metastasis of
prostate cancer cells, especially in high Gleason score
and in CRPC [23, 24]. Thus, selective targeting of this
pathway may provide opportunities to affect prostate
cancer growth. Currently, several small-molecule
inhibitors targeting different proteins of the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway, especially a class of dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors, which bind to and inactivate both
PI3K and mTOR, have shown potent anticancer activity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in prostate cancer in pre-clinical and clinic trials [25,
26] (Table 3). PF-04691502 and GDC-0980 are novel,
potent, selective class I PI3K and mTOR inhibitors
[27,  28]. GDC-0941 is a potent inhibitor of PI3Kα/δ
[29]. All three drugs have entered phase I or II clinical
trials [30, 31]. Our data here indicated that GDC-0980,
GDC-0941 or PF-04691502 alone efficiently inhibited
cell proliferation (Fig. 3A) with inactivation of the PI3K
pathway, including Akt, S6 and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 3B), and
induced apoptosis in both castration-sensitive LNCaP
cells and castration-resistant 22Rv1 and VCaP cells. In
contrast, AR-resistant LNCaP cells (LNCaP ‘MDV-R’)
are insensitive to PI3K/mTOR inhibition (Fig. 2A).
Similar to the AKT inhibitor, anti-tumor effects are
likely transient and resistance occurs after chronic
exposure. However, combinations of LY294002, GDC0980, GDC-0941 or PF-04691502 with AR signaling

with induction of enhanced apoptosis compared to single
agent therapy. Hence, a combination is likely to be more
effective than monotherapy and also may reduce drug
dosage to minimize side effect to normal tissue in elderly
patients with CRPC.
Studies of cell cycle progression in prostate cancer
cells have shown that androgen is a critical regulator
of the G1-S transition. Mechanistic investigation
has revealed that AR mediates cdk4/6 activation and
subsequent phosphorylation and inactivation of the
retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) to promote
G1-S phase progression and thereby govern androgendependent proliferation [32, 33]. Knudsen et al. and
Xu et al. reported that prostate cancer cells deprived of
androgen arrest in early G1 phase [34, 35]. Similarly,
our data in this study show inhibition of AR by
Enzalutamide dramatically blocked prostate cancer
cells entering S phase from G1 (Fig. 6), especially in
androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Interestingly, the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling has been implicated to
regulate both G1/S and G2/M transition [36]. Inhibition
of PI3K by LY294002 or other PI3K inhibitors and
mTOR by rapamycin have been demonstrated to induce
G1 cell cycle arrest in the prostate cancer cells [37] and
other human malignances [38, 39]. However, recently
LY294002 has been shown to block G2/M transition
in retinal cells [40]. The novel PI3K/mTOR inhibitors,
GDC-0980, GDC-0941 and PF-04691502 have been
reported to induce G1 cell-cycle arrest in breast, lung,
glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells
[27, 41–43]. In contrast, here exposure to PF-04691502
markedly  resulted in G2/M arrest in both castrationsensitive and resistant cell lines (Fig. 6). The detailed
molecular mechanisms need further investigation.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that
disruption of AR signaling by androgen depletion or
AR inhibitor upregulate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
and subsequently acquire resistance to PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor. Conversely, chronic inhibition of the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway acquires resistance to AR inhibitor
therapy. Suppression of PI3K/mTOR alone results in
inactivation of Akt, S6 and 4EBP1, reduction of cell

proliferation induction of apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle
arrest. Most important, we show that dual inhibition of
AR and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways has synergistic
inhibitory effect of cell growth associated with increase
of apoptosis in both castration-sensitive and resistant
prostate cancer cells. These results suggest that PI3K/
mTOR axis should be inhibited in combination with
AR inhibition in hormone sensitive and CRPC in early
therapeutic trials.

in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, VA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM sodium pyruvate
and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in a

and PI3K/mTOR  inhibitors: GDC-0980, GDC-0941,
LY294002 and PF-04691502 were purchased from http://
Selleckchem.com (Houston, TX). The compounds were
dissolved at 50 mM in DMSO as a stock solution, and
then further diluted to desired concentrations for in vitro
experiments. Anti-AR, Anti-PSA and anti-PARP (H-250)
antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473 and Thr308),

anti-phospho-S6, anti-phospho-4E-BP1 and anti-GAPDH
(14C10) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA), and anti-β-actin antibody was purchased
from Sigma (St Louis, MO).

flow cytometer and the cell cycle profile was analyzed
by ModFit software. Cell aggregates were gated out of
the analysis, based on the width of the propidium iodide
fluorescence signal. Each profile was compiled from
10,000 gated events.

Cell proliferation assay (MTS assay)

Immunoblotting

Cells were seeded at 10,000 per well in 96-well
culture plates and allowed to grow for 24 hr followed
by the desired treatment with increasing concentrations
of the indicated agents (Enzalutamide, Abiraterone,
GDC-0980, GDC-0941, LY294002 and PF-04691502)
for 4 days. Viable cell densities were determined using
a CellTiter 96 Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega).
Absorbance readings at 490 nm were analyzed against
the control group for each drug treatment to determine
cell viability. The studies were performed in triplicates
x 4 and IC50 values were estimated by Calcusyn software
(Biosoft, UK). For combination studies of AR inhibition
plus PI3K/mTOR inhibition, an equipotent ratio was
calculated to determine a combined graded combination
treatment. The equipotent ratio is the ratio of the median
effects resulting from the single dose treatments of AR
inhibitors and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. A control group was
established for each drug treatment in six replicates. The
effects of the combined treatments were determined by the
combination-index (CI) and isobologram methods derived
from the median-effect principle of Chou and Talalay.

The cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer
containing 50 mM Tris.Cl (pH 7.4), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5%
NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM Sodium Fluoride, and 2 ml/ml
Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Protein
concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein
assay kit (Hercules, CA) and 50 μg of protein was resolved
by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins
were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and
non-specific binding was blocked by incubating with 5%
nonfat milk in TBST buffer (0.01 M Tris-Cl, 0.15 M NaCl,
0.5% Tween-20, pH 8.0) at room temperature for 1 hr. The
membrane was subjected to the indicated antibodies and
the proteins were detected by a LI-COR Odyssey Infrared
Imaging System.

Statistical analysis
All in vitro experiments were performed in triplicate.
The results were expressed as mean± S.D. The difference
between two mean values were measured by the Student’s
t-test (Excel) and considered to be statistically significant
when p ≤ 0.05.

Apoptosis assay
Cells were treated with 10 μM of Enzalutamide
or 0.2 μM of PF-04691502 or combination of 10 μM
of Enzalutamide and 0.2 μM of PF-04691502 for 72 h.
Using Annexin V staining to detect apoptosis, treated
cells were harvested and rinsed with cold PBS once.
After centrifugation for 5 min, cells were resuspended
in 500 μl of 1x Annexin V binding buffer (BioVision,
Annexin V-FITC Reagent Kit, Cat.#1001–1000) and then
added 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl of Propidium
Iodide (BioVision, Annexin V-FITC Reagent Kit). After
incubation for 5 min at room temperature in the dark, the
samples were analyzed by flow cytometry.
