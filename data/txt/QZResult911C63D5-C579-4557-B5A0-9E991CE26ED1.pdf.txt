ABSTRACT
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive and lethal malignancy
with limited therapeutic options. Trabectedin has a high antitumor activity in preclinical
models of biliary tract carcinoma (BTC), being a promising alternative treatment. Here,
we studied the effect of trabectedin at transcriptomic level on an ICC patient derived
xenograft (PDX) and on the derived cell line, MT-CHC01. Further, putative targets of
trabectedin were explored in the in vitro model. In vitro, trabectedin inhibited genes
involved in protein modification, neurogenesis, migration, and motility; it induced the
expression of genes involved in keratinization, tissues development, and apoptotic
processes. In the PDX model, trabectedin affected ECM-receptor interaction, focal
adhesion, complement and coagulation cascades, Hedgehog, MAPK, EGFR signaling
via PIP3 pathway, and apoptosis. Among down-regulated genes, we selected SYK and
LGALS1; their silencing caused a significantly reduction of migration, but did not affect
proliferation in in vitro models. In MT-CHC01 cells, 24 microRNAs were deregulated
upon drug treatment, while only 5 microRNAs were perturbed by trabectedin in PDX.
The target prediction analysis showed that SYK and LGALS1 are putative targets of
up-regulated microRNAs. In conclusion, we described that trabectedin affected genes
and microRNAs involved in tumor progression and metastatic processes, reflecting
data previously obtained at macroscopically level; in particular, we identified SYK and
LGALS1 as new putative targets of trabectedin.

compared to gem alone (progression free survival, PFS,
of 8 vs. 6.7 months; overall survival, OS of 11.6 months
vs 8.0 months) [6]. These data demonstrate the lack
of effective therapies and consequently the need of
identifying alternative therapeutic approaches.
Trabectedin (Ecteinascidin-743 or ET-743) is a
marine derived compound isolated from the Caribbean
tunicate Ecteinascidia Turbinata with a potent antitumor
effect, based on a particular mechanism of action. It acts
as an alkylating agent by binding to the minor groove of
DNA, inducing double-strand DNA breaks and interacting
with transcription factors, in particular the NF-Y which
interacts with the CCAAT box [7–10]. Recent data suggest
that the nucleotide excision repair mechanism plays a key

INTRODUCTION
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second
most common liver cancer type [1, 2]. It is aggressive and
with poor prognosis, with limited therapeutic options.
Patients with unresectable disease (70-90%) have a poor
prognosis with a survival of less than 12 months following
diagnosis [3, 4]. Conventional therapy gives only marginal
benefit [5]. Several dosage schedules of single-agent
gemcitabine (gem) have been tested obtaining response
rates of about 20%. To date, the standard of treatment is
the combination of gem and cisplatin; a meta-analysis
conducted by Valle and collaborators demonstrated that
this association gave a significant survival advantage,

role in trabectedin antitumor activity. It was described
that trabectedin could specifically interact with the DNA
transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER)
process [11], which in normal conditions repairs DNA
adducts caused by UV rays, cisplatin or others anticancer
agents by involvement of proteins belonging to family
of XP11 and NER factors. Thus, the double-strand
DNA breaks formed are more persistent if there is loss
of homologous DNA repair [12]. Further, it has been
described that trabectedin had a potent antitumor activity
both on tumor cells as well as on microenvironment [13].
It is also known that trabectedin causes a marked decrease
in the production of several cytokines and chemokines
secreted by monocytes/macrophages and tumor cells.
For example, trabectedin treatment down-regulates
the expression of IL-6 (Interleukin-6), CCL2, CXCL8,
Angiopoietin 2 or VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth
factor) [14].
Trabectedin has been approved for treatment of
ovarian cancer and soft-tissue sarcoma with significant
activity in liposarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, and Ewing
sarcoma, both as a single agent and in combination
with other drugs [15–18]. Trabectedin has also shown
promising pre clinical activity against other different
cancer cell lines in vitro and transplantable in vivo human
tumor xenografts [19–28].
We have recently demonstrated that trabectedin
has an antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo in
preclinical models of human biliary tract carcinoma
(BTC). We reported that trabectedin inhibits BTC in
vitro cell growth and causes a significant delay of tumor
growth in vivo in mouse models of human BTC, EGI-1
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma xenograft and a new
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patient-derived
tumor xenograft (PDX) [19], causing a decrease of
tumor proliferating cells and tumor vessel formation.
Transcriptomic analysis revealed that, upon trabectedin
treatment, there is a deregulation of genes involved in
IL-6, Sonic Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways, all
related to cholangiocarcinogenesis.
Here, we used a human intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma paired PDX and cell line model to
investigate the changes in gene and microRNA expression
in response to trabectedin. The aim of this study is the
identification of differentially expressed genes, of related
biological pathways and microRNAs which may be
relevant as specific targets of trabectedin. Furthermore, we
studied the effective role of two genes as putative targets
of trabectedin in the in vitro model.

cells. We applied a filter on LogFC value and considered
for the analysis only probes with a Log FC <-1 or > 1.
Upon trabectedin treatment, 1,254 differentially expressed
gene transcripts were identified, of which 948 were downand 306 up-regulated. Gene Ontology was performed
using DAVID Annotation tool; Supplementary Table S1
summarized the biological processes significantly enriched
within down-and up-regulated probes. Trabectedin
is able to negatively influence regulation of GTPase
activity, processes related to neurogenesis, migration,
cell adhesion, and microtubules organization. On the
other hand, trabectedin induces the expression of genes
involved in keratinization, epidermis, endoderm and tissue
development, and apoptotic processes.
The same analysis was performed to identify
pathways enriched within down- and up-regulated genes
(Kegg database) (Supplementary Table S2); the most
significant down-regulated pathway includes genes
involved in focal adhesion.
The same filter applied to MT-CHC01 was used for
PDX data yielding only 28 differentially expressed genes.
Relaxing cut-offs (Log FC <0.58 or >0.58 and p-value
<0.05), we obtained 1,346 differentially expressed genes
of which 628 were down- and 718 up-regulated.
As shown in Supplementary Table S3, Gene
Ontology revealed a globally down-regulation of
genes involved in eye, organ and skin morphogenesis,
tissue development, immune response and regulation
of angiogenesis. In contrast, there is an up-regulation
of genes involved in inflammation process, muscle
development, negative regulation of signal transduction,
and different biosynthetic processes.
Further, we found that down-regulated genes caused
an enrichment of pathways involved in ECM-receptor
interaction, focal adhesion, complement and coagulation
cascades, and Hedgehog signaling pathways. On the
contrary, for up-regulated genes we found an enrichment
of MAPK pathway, EGFR signaling via PIP3, and
apoptosis (Supplementary Table S4).
The next step was the identification of common
deregulated genes between the in vitro and in vivo
models. We found 223 concordant overlapping genes, of
which 75 down-and 148 up-regulated after trabectedin
treatment (Supplementary Table S5A-S5B). An
unsupervised cluster analysis of this gene set shows a
separation between trabectedin-treated from not treated
samples (Figure 1).
The Gene Ontology analysis was performed on
down-and up-regulated genes separately (Table 1).
The ECM-receptor transition pathway, Systemic
lupus erythematosus, Hedgehog signaling pathway, and
Basal cell carcinoma (p <0.05) are the common pathways
enriched by down-regulated genes. No statistically
significant common pathways are enriched by upregulated genes.
In order to validate expression data, we analyzed by
RT-qPCR the expression of the common down-regulated

genes. The same trend of expression was revealed for all
genes in both MT-CHC01 and PDX after trabectedin
treatment, as shown in Figure 2A-2B.

To verify if their silencing exerted the same effect of
trabectedin, we silenced them at first in MT-CHC01 cells.
Both qRT-PCR and Western Blot analysis, either upon
trabectedin treatment or after silencing with single specific
siRNA or a pool of them, showed the inhibition of targeted
genes (Figure 3).
To investigate the functional role of these genes,
we performed cell viability and migration assays. Cell
viability of MT-CHC01 cells is significant decreased
after trabectedin treatment, with an IC50 value of 1.85
nM (Supplementary Figure S1 Panel A-B). Further,

Trabectedin affects the expression of microRNAs
involved in apoptosis and tumor progression

induce apoptosis after 48 hours of trabectedin treatment
(Supplementary Figure S1, Panel C-D).
Conversely, the knock-down of single genes or
their combination does not decrease the proliferation
of MT-CHC01 cells (data not shown). Cell migration,
significantly reduced by trabectedin treatment, is
statistically significant inhibited also by silencing of SYK
and LGALS1; the simultaneous silencing of target genes
potentiates the anti-migratory effect (Figure 4).
To enforce these data, we repeated the same
experiments on the ECC cell line WITT. Both qRT-PCR
and Western Blot analysis demonstrated that trabectedin
inhibited the expression of targets, as well as their
silencing (Figure 5).
Similarly to the MT-CHC01, single and combined
knock-down of SYK and LGALS1 reduced cell migration
in a statistical significant manner (Figure 6), but did not
have effect on proliferation (data not shown).

MicroRNA profiling of MT-CHC01 cells identified
24 deregulated microRNAs upon trabectedin treatment,
either up or down-regulated. Supplementary Table S6
summarizes these microRNAs and their known role in
cancerogenesis. Globally, upon trabectedin treatment, we
found a deregulation of microRNAs involved in tumor
progression, proliferation and migration, both as direct or
indirect way. In particular, three microRNAs (miR-21-3p,
miR-21-5p and miR-31-3p) have already been described
as involved and up-regulated in BTC [29–31]; in our
setting, they were inhibited by trabectedin, suggesting
that they could represent candidate targets of this drug.

microRNAs, we did not find any common pathways for
both up-and down-regulated microRNAs. Considering upand down-regulated microRNAs separately, we performed
a pathway union analysis, which used an algorithm able
to predict all the significant pathways targeted by selected
microRNAs. As shown in Figure 7, down-regulated
microRNAs (Panel A) affected in a statistically significant
way the focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, protein
digestion and absorption, MAPK, PI3K-Akt, ERBB
signaling pathways. Considering up-regulated microRNAs
(Panel B), we found many affected pathways such as
glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, lysine degradation,
calcium signaling, MAPK and Hedgehog pathways.
The analysis performed on PDX model showed a
deregulation of only five microRNAs, two up-regulated
(miR-4284 and miR-375) and three down- (miR-22-3p,
let-7c, and miR-214-3p). Figure 8 summarizes pathways
affected by down-(Panel A) and up-regulated (Panel B)

microRNAs using the Pathway Union algorithm, which
evaluated the probability that the examined pathways
are significantly enriched for gene targets of at least one
microRNA.
Further, we revealed that miR-4284 was upregulated in both in vitro and in vivo models after
trabectedin treatment. Validation of the microRNAs
expression was obtained by RT-qPCR (Supplementary
Figure S2).

MicroRNA-gene targets interaction analysis
To verify if there were interactions among the
microRNA signature and the common modulated
genes, we used miRWalk 2.0 database. We considered
as significant the interactions predicted by at least
4 databases. As shown in Figure 9, we found that upregulated microRNAs has 13,748 predictive targets,

of which 50 down-regulated overlapped to our gene
signature. On the contrary, down-regulated microRNAs
are able to interact with 12,935 genes, of which 66 upregulated genes belonged to our dataset.
Interestingly, the microRNA-target prediction
analysis showed that SYK is a putative target of all upregulated microRNAs, while LGALS1 is a predicted target
only of miR1207-5p and miR1225-5p.

Trabectedin is able to negatively influence the
expression of genes involved in migration, invasion,
motility, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT),
confirming the important role of trabectedin in inhibiting
angiogenesis and metastatic processes demonstrated
in other malignancies [19, 28, 32–34]. Interestingly,
we observed a down-regulation of genes involved in
neurogenesis and regulation of neurological processes;
it has been demonstrated that neurons and glial cells not
only lead to higher cancer cell proliferation at the tumor
invasion front, but also further enhance angiogenesis and
neurogenesis in tumors [35].
On the contrary, trabectedin treatment is able to
induce the expression of genes involved in p53 pathway,
previously described by Martinez and collaborators [36],
demonstrating that the drug induced the overexpression
of genes related to stress and DNA damage, such as p53,
CDKN1A, and ATF3. Moreover, it is able to induce the
expression of genes involved in apoptotic and cell death
processes, underlying the high therapeutic role of this
drug. An overexpression of RASD1 seems to increase
apoptosis via mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in prostate,
breast, and lung cancer cell lines [37, 38]. IFIT2 is a
tumor suppressor gene in gastric cancer [39], promoting

DISCUSSION
BTC is an aggressive neoplasia with a complex
molecular pathogenesis; the current clinical approaches
are limited and the poor prognosis, due also to the scarce
therapeutic options, encourages the evaluation of new
drugs. Trabectedin is a promising chemotherapeutic
agent already used in clinical practice in different cancer
types. Our group previously demonstrated that trabectedin
has a high antitumor activity in BTC preclinical
models, significantly slowing tumor growth, inhibiting
proliferation and neovascularization processes, suggesting
its potential as alternative chemotherapy option. Here, we
studied the global effect of trabectedin on transcriptome in
the paired xenopatient-cell line model.

apoptosis and cell death. In our models, these genes are
induced by trabectedin treatment, supporting the apoptotic
process as previously demonstrated in vitro [19].
We evidenced that trabectedin perturbes genes
involved in different cellular processes, among which
the regulation of proliferation and migration. For this
reason, we selected two down-regulated genes, SYK
and LGALS1 to investigate if their suppression could
reflect the effect of trabectedin on these processes. SYK
is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in a variety
of tissues, in particular in hematopoietic cells. Its role
in cancer progression is controversial; in breast cancer
it has a tumor suppressor role, while in head and neck
and prostate cancer acted as an oncogene [40–42]. The
role of LGALS1, a member of the lectin superfamily, is
more defined; it is involved in different cellular function,
as transduction, protein-protein interactions, cell-cycle
progression, apoptosis, sustained proliferative signaling,

resistance to cell death signals, evasion of immune
surveillance, induction of angiogenesis, and activation
of the metastatic potential. It is over-expressed in colon,
liver, pancreatic cancer, in ICC and in their surrounding
stroma cells; its overexpression seems to be associated
with neoplastic progression and proliferative activities
[43–46]. The silencing of each gene separately produced
a statistically significant inhibition of migration, but
not effect on proliferation. The simultaneous inhibition
of these targets potentiates the anti-migratory effect,
suggesting a crosstalk between SYK and LGALS1.
In the work of Fulcher and collaborators, it has been
demonstrated that Gal1, the protein encoded by LGALS1,
induced cell activation and migration through the
phosphorylation of Syk in dendritic cells [47]. The lack of
inhibition of proliferation demonstrated that the silencing
of these genes is not sufficient to mimic trabectedin effect,
suggesting that a more complex mechanism of drug-targets

tumor growth, migration and invasion [49]. In the in vivo
model, only five miRNAs are affected by trabectedin. It
has been previously demonstrated that miR-375, found
up-regulated in our PDX model, is a tumor suppressor in
colon cancer and pancreatic cancer, by inhibiting PI3K/
Akt via [50, 51]. A down-regulation of miR-214 upon
trabectedin treatment was also found; Li and collaborators
demonstrated that its inhibition correlated with a high risk
of metastasis increasing the transcription of TWIST. In
our model, TWIST is slightly down-regulated, suggesting
that miR-214 could have different mechanism of action in
BTC [52]. The unique common microRNA up-regulated
in both models is miR-4284. Its role is not clear, but in
a work of Yang, miR-4284 seems to be overexpressed
by bermamine, a natural chemotherapeutic agent, in
glioblastoma cells; they demonstrated its role as tumor
suppressor, promoting apoptosis in cancer stem cells of
glioblastoma [53]. Interestingly, we found that 116 genes

regulates cell growth. The role of trabectedin on SYK
and LGALS1 inhibition is confirmed in the extrahepatic
cell line WITT, with a significant reduction of migration
ability, supporting our hypothesis that they are putative
targets of this drug.
MicroRNA expression revealed a major number
of alterations in the in vitro model. MiR-21-3p, miR-215p and miR-31-3p have already been described in BTC,
in particular they are up-regulated in ICC [31]. In our
models, after trabectedin treatment they are significantly
down-regulated, making them putative targets of the
drug. The same mechanism could be supposed for
miRNA 331-3p, down-regulated by trabectedin and
demonstrated to promote proliferation and EMT in
hepatocellular carcinoma [48]. On the contrary, miR494-3p is up-regulated after drug treatment; in a previous
work of Shen and collaborators, they demonstrated that
a constitutive over-expression of this miRNA reduced

of our signature are predicted targets of deregulated
microRNAs; in particular, the down-regulated gene SYK
is target of all up-regulated microRNAs, while LGALS1
is a putative target of miR-1207-5p, miR-1225-5p. These
microRNAs have a role as tumor suppressors; in fact, their
up-regulation caused a reduction of motility and invasion
in breast and gastric cancers [54, 55], supporting our data
on migration in BTC cell lines. These findings suggest
further investigations to study their interaction with SYK
and LGALS1, both involved in migration process.
In conclusion, we described that trabectedin affects
genes and microRNAs involved in processes related
to tumor progression and metastasis, reflecting results
obtained at macroscopically level in BTC. We identified
two trabectedin putative targets involved in motility and
migration, supporting the role of trabectedin as antimetastatic agent. Further studies of gene-microRNA
networking and consequent functional studies will be
planned to investigate the complex post-transcriptional
alterations caused by trabectedin treatment.

cells were treated with 5 nM of trabectedin for 24-48 hours
and then processed as described in our previous work [19].

Gene and microRNA expression analysis
For gene expression analysis (GEP), total RNA of
MT-CHC01s cells and of PDX, both untreated or treated
with trabectedin, was extracted by using the Absolutely
RNA miRNA kit (Agilent Technologies), following
manufacturers’ protocols. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluation of total RNA was performed by Nanodrop
and BioAnalyzer respectively. For GEP analysis, 100
ng of total RNA were amplified and labeled using Low
Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit, one-color kit (Agilent
Technologies). Six hundred ng of labeled RNA were
hybridized on SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression
8x60K v2 glass arrays. Arrays were scanned and images
analyzed by the Feature Extraction Software from Agilent
Technologies (version 10.7), and raw data were then
processed using the Bioconductor package Limma (Linear
models for microarray analysis). Background correction
was performed with the normexp method with an offset
of 50, and quantile was used for the between-array
normalization. The empirical Bayes method was used to
compute a moderated t-statistics. For microRNA analysis,
100 ng of total RNA were labeled using the miRNA
Complete Labeling and Hyb Kit and hybridized on Human
miRNA Microarray Kit Release 16.0, 8x60K. Arrays were
scanned and images analyzed by the Feature Extraction
Software from Agilent Technologies (version 10.7). Raw
data elaboration was carried out with Bioconductor, using
R statistical language. Quantile was used for betweenarray normalization. The Limma (LInear Models for
Microarray Analysis) package was then used to identify
differentially expressed micro RNAs in trabectedin-treated
versus not treated mice or cell line. The empirical Bayes
method was used to compute a moderated t-statistics. Gene
expression profiling and microRNA data are available on
GEO (GSE84939).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples and drug treatment
The patient derived xenograft (PDX) was obtained
and treated with trabectedin as previously described
[19]. Briefly, PDX were intra venous treated with 0.15
mg/Kg/weekly or with drug vehicle for 21 days. The
establishment and characterization process of its paired
cell line, MT-CHC01, is described in our recent work
[56]. The extrahepatic cell line WITT (provided by Dr.
Andersen, BRIC Center, Copenhagen) was cultured in
DMEM (Sigma–Aldrich) plus 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS).
For gene expression and microRNA analysis, MTCHC01 cells (600,000/well) were plated onto 6-well tissue
culture plates in complete Knockout/DMEM/F-12 medium
plus 10% FBS; after 24 hours, they were treated with a
dose of 5 nM of trabectedin, then, after further 24 hours,
cells were detached and lysed in TRIZOL reagent for RNA
extraction.
For cell viability assay, MT-CHC01 cells (3,000/
well) were seeded onto 96-well tissue culture plates;
after 24 hours they were treated with escalating doses of
trabectedin (0.019-10 nM) in appropriate culture medium
added of 10% FBS for another 72 hours. Cell growth was
evaluated with the Cell Titer-Glo® cell viability assay
(Promega). All tests were performed in quadruplicate and
repeated in three independent experiments. IC50 values,
dose of drug that inhibits 50% of the cell growth compared
with control calculated for each cell line after 72 hours
of drug treatment, were calculated using the CalcuSyn
software, based on the Chou-Talalay method. To test the
effect of the drug on cell cycle and apoptosis, MT-CHC01

qRT-PCR validation
RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with the
High capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied
Biosystem). The cDNA was used for amplification of
CDH2, WNT7B, PMEPA1, NAV2, ATF3, NOV, CD68,
RASD, SYK, LGALS1 deregulated genes and PGK
housekeeping gene with specific primers (Supplementary
Table S7). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out in
triplicate. Further, a validation of the expression of miR4284, miR 21-5p, and miR-494-3p was performed using
TaqMan Assay. MicroRNAs expression was normalized
on the expression of RNU48 as endogenous control.
Quantitative analysis was performed by the measurement
of Ct values [57].

intracellulare sensibili ai farmaci nel colangiocarcinoma
intraepatico (ICC)”. Fondazione Piemontese per la
Ricerca sul Cancro - Onlus - “Identification of new
druggable pathways in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma”
5 per Mille 2010 Ministero della Salute; Università di
Torino anno 2014 - Fondo per la ricerca locale (Linea B),
LEOF_RIC_LOC_14_01 project title: “Transcriptomic
and genetic analysis of paired primary and recurrent
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma”; CPN is supported
by University of Turin; GC is supported by FPO; GC
is supported by a grant of Compagnia di San Paolo; PO
is supported by a grant of “Lauretana”; MA and FL are
supported by University of Turin and FPO.

About 600,000 MT-CHC01 and WITT cells were
plated in a 6 multiwell plate; at about 50% of confluence,
cells were transiently transfected using oligofectamine
(Life Technologies) and specific siRNAs for LGALS1,
SYK, their combination, and negative control siRNA (all
from Sigma) at the concentration of 20 µM in Optimum
medium without serum. After 4 hours, cells were washed
and complete and appropriate medium for each cell line
was replaced. After 24 hours, the SYK and LGALS1
silencing efficiency was tested by qRT-PCR and Western
blot analysis. Briefly, cells were detached and lysed in
TRIZOL for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis as
previously described, and in Cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, USA) for Western blot analysis;
homogenized cells were then centrifuged at 20,000xg for 30
minutes; 20 μg of protein were separated with Mini-Protean
TGX Precast Gels, 4-20%, then transferred using TransBlot Turbo on nitrocellulose Midi membranes (Biorad).
Blots were stained using standard procedures and signals
were revealed by a chemiluminescence reagent (Euroclone,
Milan, Italy). Primary antibody against LGALS1, SYK,
Vinculin, and secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG
hrp-linked antibodies are from Cell Signaling.

Wound healing assay
After 24 hours from silencing, the confluent MTCHC01 and WITT cells were gently wounded with a 200
μl tip; wound closure was monitored in each plate for
24 hours. The gap distance was analyzed using ImageJ
software; 0% represents the time of wound (T0). The
percentage of closure was calculated as 100-(T/T0) x 100,
where T represents the average wound closures at the
different time points. Statistical analysis was performed
using one-way ANOVA and multiple comparison test
(GraphPad software). The assay was performed in three
different experiments.
