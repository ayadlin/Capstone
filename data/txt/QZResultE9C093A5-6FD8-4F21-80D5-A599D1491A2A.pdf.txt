Abstract:

Since angiogenesis is critical for tumor growth and metastasis, anti-angiogenic
treatment is a highly promising therapeutic approach. Thus, for over last couple
of decades, there has been a robust activity aimed towards the discovery
of angiogenesis inhibitors. More than forty anti-angiogenic drugs are being
tested in clinical trials all over the world. This review discusses agents that
have been approved by FDA and are currently in use for treating patients
either as single-agents or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.

WHAT IS ANGIOGENESIS?

the surrounding tissue to promote growth of new blood
vessels. This stimulates vascular endothelial cells to
divide rapidly [9, 10]. The other model proposes the
generation of new vasculature by vasculogenic mimicry.
This model argues that the tumor cells trans-differentiate
in endothelial-like cells and create structures from inside
of the tumor tapping into a nearby blood vessel [4].

The process of formation of new blood vessels from
pre-existing blood vessels is termed as angiogenesis. In
normal physiology, angiogenesis is necessary for repair
and healing of tissues. Classically, there are sub-types
of angiogenesis e.g., Sprouting angiogenesis which
involves stimulation of endothelial cells to proliferate
into the surrounding matrix and form solid sprouts
extending towards the angiogenic stimulus leading to the
formation of an entirely new vessel [1, 2]; Intussusception
or splitting angiogenesis which involves division of the
lumen of an existing vessel resulting in formation two
vessels [3, 4]; Vasculogenesis, which is the formation of
vasculature from endothelial stem cells or angioblasts,
which proliferate into de-novo endothelial cells [5].
However, from the cancer biology perspective,
angiogenesis is one of the most critical steps in the
hematogenous metastasis as it provides the escape route
for the tumor cells from the confines of the primary tumor
and allows their seeding in distant organs [6].

ANGIOGENESIS AND METASTASIS
Escape of the tumor cell from the confines of the
primary tumor to distant body parts is the pre-requisite for
hematogenous metastasis. This escape route is provided
by the tumor vasculature. Thus, it was envisioned that
inhibition of angiogenesis will also lead to inhibition of
metastasis. This phenomenon was demonstrated by very
elegant mouse model studies using angiostatin [11, 12].
Angiostatin was also demonstrated to be secreted by
some primary tumors leading to restricted growth of the
metastasis leading to “dormancy” of the metastasis. Mice
deficient in angiogenesis (Id1 & Id3 deficient) showed
significantly less tumor take rates [13]. Independent
studies showed absence of metastasis in angiogenesis
deficient mice [14, 15]. Defective angiogenesis was
attributed to impaired VEGF-dependent recruitment of
precursor endothelial cells from the bone marrow to the
newly developing tumor vasculature [16].

TUMOR ANGIOGENESIS
Some of the early classic experiments have
demonstrated that tumor angiogenesis is indispensable
for the growth of solid tumors [7, 8]. Tumor angiogenesis
is generation of a network of blood vessels within the
cancerous growth. This process can occur two ways: The
more accepted model involves the release of signaling
molecules by the tumor cells; these molecules activate

nodes is one of the early signs of cancer spread in patients,
and it occurs at least as frequently as hematogenous
metastasis [17]. Particularly, in cancers, such as breast
cancer, lymphatic metastasis is a predominant route for
tumor spread. The contribution of lymphatic system to
the tumor growth is an area that is relatively less studied.
However, lymphatic vessels are speculated to contribute
to tumor growth and metastasis in a variety of ways. The
VEGF, FGF2 and PDGF produced by vascular endothelial
cells are proposed to be involved in the activation of
lymphatic endothelial cells, which in turn produce matrix
metalloproteases and urokinase plasminogen activator
(uPA) that can promote malignant tumor growth. Thus,
there exists a synergistic crosstalk between the tumor and
the lymphatic vessels and blood vessels.

REGULATORS
ANGIOGENESIS

OF

Tumor cells activate signaling pathways that promote
uncontrolled proliferation and survival. These include the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, Hedgehog pathway and, Wnt
pathway [18-24] that produce pro-angiogenic signaling
intermediates [25, 26]. Among the several reported
activators of angiogenesis present in cells two proteins
appear to be the most important for sustaining tumor
growth: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). VEGF and bFGF
are secreted by the tumor into the surrounding tissue.
They bind to their cognate receptors on endothelial cells.
This activates a signaling cascade that transmits a nuclear
signal prompting target genes to activate endothelial cell
growth. Activated endothelial cells also produce matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs). These MMPs break down the
extracellular matrix and allow the migration of endothelial
cells. The division and migration of the endothelial cells
leads to formation of new blood vessels [27, 28].

TUMOR

Angiogenesis is a complex and intricately regulated
process. Like all other regulated biological phenomena,
angiogenesis has activators or pro-angiogenic factors and
inhibitors or anti-angiogenic factors [9].

Targets of FDA-approved angiogenesis inhibitors: Angiogenesis inhibitors impact both, the tumor as well as the endothelial
cells resulting in the disruption of the effects of the microenvironment in promoting tumor growth and angiogenesis. Tumor

cells produce pro-angiogenic agents including VEGF, bFGF and TGF-α by the signaling pathways such as Hh pathway (19) as well as their
intermediates including oncoproteins such as COX-2 and osteopontin (25, 26). These factors signal and activate endothelial cells that produce
proteases such as MMPs that facilitate invasive properties of the tumor cells. Bevacizumab binds to and squelches the availability of VEGF.
Cetuximab and Panitumumab inhibit the activities of VEGF receptor ( ). Tumor cells themselves are negatively impacted by Trastuzumab
that deprives the effects of HER-2. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Erlotinib, Sorafenib and Sunitinib block the activity
of multiple growth factor receptors ( ) including VEGF receptors, PDGF-receptors, RET and Raf-1. Rapamycin targets mTOR. The exact
molecular targets of other agents including thalidomide and Bortezomib are not fully understood.

then agents that inhibit angiogenesis would have great
therapeutic value. With the discovery of endostatin, the
concept of anti-angiogenic therapy was launched and
popularized by Dr. Folkman [29]. Angiogenesis inhibitors
have been discovered from a variety of sources. Some are
naturally present in the human body e.g. specific fragments
of structural proteins such as collagen or plasminogen
(angiostatin, endostatin, tumstatin) [30]. Others are natural
products in green tea, soy beans, fungi, mushrooms, tree
bark, shark tissues, snake venom etc. [31]. A plethora of
synthetic compounds are also characterized to have antiangiogenic properties [32].

to the normal cells. Chemotherapy has significant side
effects such as hair loss, diarrhea, mouth ulcer, infection,
and low blood counts. Anti-angiogenic therapy has several
advantages over chemotherapy as it is mostly not directed
towards directly killing cells but stopping the blood
vessel formation, an event that is rare in tissues other than
growing tumor. Hence it is well tolerated by the patients
and has fewer side effects [29]. There are currently seven
approved anti-cancer therapies in two primary categories:
1. Monoclonal antibodies directed against specific
pro-angiogenic growth factors and/or their receptors
2. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
of multiple pro-angiogenic growth factor receptors.
Besides these, inhibitors of mTOR (mammalian
target of rapamycin), proteasome inhibitors and
thalidomide have also been reported to indirectly inhibit
angiogenesis through mechanisms that are not completely
understood.

ANTI-ANGIOGENIC TREATEMENT OF
CANCER
Since angiogenesis is an event critical to primary
tumor growth as well as metastasis, anti-angiogenic
treatment of tumors is a highly promising therapeutic
avenue [33]. Thus, for over last couple of decades, there
has been a robust activity aimed towards the discovery
of angiogenesis inhibitors [34, 35]. More than forty
anti-angiogenic drugs are being tested in human cancer
patients in clinical trials all over the world. From the
several anti-angiogenic agents reported, we have focused
this review on discussing those agents that have received
FDA approval in the United States and are currently in
use for treating patients either as a single-agent or in
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (Figure
1). Based on functionality, the anti-angiogenic drugs can
be sub-divided into three main groups:

Monoclonal Antibody Therapies
Four monoclonal antibody therapies are approved to
treat several tumor types:

Bevacizumab (Avastin®)
The first FDA approved angiogenesis inhibitor,
Avastin is a humanized monoclonal antibody that
binds biologically active forms of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and prevents its interaction with
VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2), thereby
inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis.
Bevacizumab has been tested in phase I studies in
combination with chemotherapy with a good safety
profile [39]. This treatment is approved for metastatic
colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer [40-43].
Bevacizumab has also evolved as a first line of treatment
in combination with paclitaxel in breast cancer patients
by virtue of its ability to double median progression-free
survival (PFS) [44]. In combination with chemoendocrine
therapy (including capecitabine and vinorelbine, and
letrozole) bevacizumab treatment significantly decreased
the percentage of viable circulating endothelial cells
and prevented the chemotherapy-induced mobilization
of circulating progenitors [45]. In combination with
irinotecan, bevacizumab significantly increased PFS
in glioma patients [46, 47]. VEGF has emerged as a
compelling therapeutic target for leukemias. Inhibition
of angiogenesis in hematological malignancies interdicts
the angiogenesis within the bone marrow ecosystem
comprised of multiple cell types, including fibroblasts,
endothelial progenitor cells, endothelial cells, dendritic
cells and, malignant cells, blocking the availability of
nutrients to cancer cells and disrupting crosstalk between
the various cell types to curtail the malignant phenotype

Drugs that inhibit growth of endothelial cells
e.g. Endostatin and combretastatin A4, cause
apoptosis of the endothelial cells [36]. Thalidomide is also
a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell growth [37].

Drugs that block angiogenesis signaling
e.g. anti-VEGF antibodies (Avastin, FDA approved
for colorectal cancer), Interferon-alpha (inhibits the
production of bFGF and VEGF) [36].

Drugs that block extracellular matrix breakdown
e.g. inhibitors of MMPs [38].

ANTI-ANGIOGENIC THERAPIES THAT
HAVE RECEIVED USA-FDA APPROVAL
Conventional chemotherapy is usually a systemic
therapy that tries to capture a narrow therapeutic window
offered by rapid proliferation of tumor cells compared

survival [63, 64]. Panitumumab is used in patients who
are not responding to regimens containing fluorouracil,
oxaliplatin, and irinotecan [60]. Patients often receive
panitumumab after receiving bevacizumab or cetuximab.
Panitumumab can be given with FOLFOX (oxaliplatin,
leucovorin, and fluorouracil) or FOLFIRI (irinotecan,
leucovorin, and fluorouracil) regimens, or as a single
agent. Currently no data are available that demonstrate an
improvement in disease-related symptoms or increased
survival with Vectibix® in colon cancer [65]. This drug
is also being tested for aerodigestive track and head and
neck cancer [66, 67].  

Cetuximab (Erbitux®)
This is a monoclonal antibody that binds the
extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), preventing ligand binding and activation of the
receptor resulting in internalization and degradation of
the receptor culminating in inhibition of cell proliferation
and angiogenesis. Cetuximab downregulated VEGF
expression in a dose-dependent manner in a human
colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cell line and in human CRC
mouse xenografts [49]. The xenografts also showed a
significant reduction in blood vessel counts following
several rounds of cetuximab treatment [49], indicating
that the tumor-promoting effects of EGFR overexpression
may be mediated through VEGF stimulation and tumor
angiogenesis. This treatment is approved for metastatic
CRC and head and neck cancer [50] in patients who
are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy. In
combination with irinotecan (an inhibitor of topoisomerase
I), cetuximab is the first monoclonal antibody that has
been approved by the FDA as second-line treatment
for metastatic colorectal cancer [51, 52]. In Phase I and
Phase III trials [53, 54] cetuximab significantly improved
the effects of radiotherapy in patients with unresectable
(cannot be removed by surgery) squamous cell carcinoma
of the head and neck (SCCHN). Cetuximab has also been
shown to sensitize cells to radiation and chemotherapy,
potentially through blocking EGFR nuclear import and
the associated activation of DNA protein kinase enzymes
necessary for repairing radiation- and chemotherapyinduced DNA damage [55]. Compared to radiation alone,
cetuximab plus radiation therapy can nearly double the
median survival in patients with a certain kind of head and
neck cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body
[54] making cetuximab the only drug achieving interesting
response rate in second line treatment of advanced
SCCHN [56]. Cetuximab was also found to be tolerated
well in combination with cisplatin, or carboplatin, and
fluorouracil [57, 58].

Trastuzumab (Herceptin®)
Is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the
extracellular domain of HER-2, which is overexpressed
in 25-30% of invasive breast cancer tumors [68]. HER2positive breast cancer is highly aggressive disease with
high recurrence rate, poorer prognosis with decreased
survival compared with HER2-negative breast cancer
[69]. Herceptin® is designed to target and block the
function of HER2 protein overexpression. This is the
first humanized antibody is approved for Breast cancer
[70]. Herceptin® is approved by the FDA to treat HER2
positive breast cancer that has metastasized after treatment
with other anticancer drugs [71]. It is also approved to
be used with other drugs to treat HER2-positive breast
cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes to be used after
surgery. The FDA first approved Herceptin in September
1998 [71-73]. In November 2006, the FDA approved
Herceptin as part of a treatment regimen containing
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel, for the
adjuvant treatment of patients with HER2-positive, nodepositive breast cancer (http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/
Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/default.htm).
In
January 2008, the FDA approved Herceptin as a single
agent for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-overexpressing
node-negative (ER/PR-negative or with one highrisk feature) or node-positive breast cancer, following
multi-modality anthracycline-based therapy (http://
biopharminternational.findpharma.com/biopharm/News/
FDA-Approves-Expanded-Adjuvant-Indications-for-Her/
ArticleStandard/Article/detail/518867).
Trastuzumab
is also being studied in the treatment of other types of
cancers such as pancreatic [74], endometrial [75], lung
[76], cervical [77] and ovarian cancer [78]

Panitumumab (Vectibix™)
It is a fully humanized anti-EGFR monoclonal
antibody that binds specifically to the human EGFR.
Panitumumab is a recombinant human monoclonal
antibody [59]; therefore, the risk of an infusion reaction
is minimized. Vectibix® is indicated as a single agent for
the treatment of EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal
carcinoma with disease progression on or following
fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing
chemotherapy regimens [60-62]. The effectiveness of
Vectibix® as a single agent for the treatment of EGFRexpressing, metastatic CRC is based on progression-free

Small Molecule Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitors (TKIs)
Protein tyrosine kinases have emerged as crucial
targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer especially
because they play an important role in the modulation of
growth factor signaling. As per ClinicalTrials.gov (www.

is also approved by FDA for gastrointestinal stromal tumor
(GIST) in patients whose disease has progressed or who
are unable to tolerate treatment with imatinib (Gleevec),
the current treatment for GIST patients [95, 96]. Sunitinib
has shown early evidence of anti-tumor activity in Phase
II trials in US, European and Asian patients with locally
advanced, unresectable and metastatic hepatocellular
carcinoma. A Phase III trial of sunitinib in hepatocellular
carcinoma is ongoing [97]. According to the NCI clinical
trials search results, Sunitinib is currently evaluated in
about 150 active clinical trials. It is evaluated for ovarian
[98], breast [99] and non small cell lung cancer [100]
among others [101].

clinicaltrials.gov), there are 43 ongoing studies on tyrosine
kinase inhibitors in angiogenesis. Since discussing all of
them is beyond the scope of this article, we have focused
our discussion on the three TKIs that are currently
approved as anti-cancer therapies:

Erlotinib (Tarceva®)
Erlotinib hydrochloride (originally coded as OSI774) is an orally available, potent, reversible, and
selective inhibitor of the EGFR (ErbB1) tyrosine kinase
activity. Erlotinib hydrochloride has been approved by
FDA for treatment of patients with locally advanced
or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior
chemotherapy regimen [79, 80]. Interesting recent studies
have demonstrated that since Erlotinib and Bevacizumab
act on two different pathways critical to tumor growth and
dissemination, administering these drugs concomitantly
may confer additional clinical benefits to cancer patients
with advanced disease. This combination therapy may
prove to be a viable second-line alternative to chemotherapy
in patients with NSCLC [81]. Also, for patients with
locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic
carcinoma, Erlotinib has received FDA approval for the
treatment in combination with gemcitabine [82, 83].
Erlotinib is also being studied in the treatment of other
types of cancers. For example combination of Erlotinib
with Bevacizumab has been evaluated in metastatic
breast cancer [84], hepatocellular carcinoma [85] and in
metastatic renal cancer [86] as phase II trials. Outcomes
for prostate, cervical and colorectal cancers treated with
Erlotinib are cautiously optimistic [87-89].

Inhibitors of mTOR
mTOR plays a part in the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway
involved in tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis
[102]. Rapamycin and related mTOR inhibitors inhibit
endothelial cell VEGF expression, as well as VEGFinduced endothelial cell proliferation [103]. Inhibitors of
mTOR are an important class of anti-angiogenic agents.
These include: deforolimus, everolimus, rapamycin
(sirolimus), and temsirolimus [104, 105]. Temsirolimus
(Toricel™) is a small molecule inhibitor of mTOR,
approved for treating advanced renal cell carcinoma
[106]. It is a type of rapamycin analog and a type of serine/
threonine kinase inhibitor, it is also called CCI-779. In preclinical models combination therapy for treating breast
cancer using anti-estrogen, ERA-923, and temsirolimus
has been successfully tested [107]. It is found to be
highly effective against human melanoma when tested
in combination with cisplatin and DTIC (in independent
studies) in a SCID mouse xenotranplantation model [108,
109]. There are over 41 active studies of Temsirolimus for
a variety of solid tumors [110]. mTOR inhibition has also
been strongly advocated in as a putative cancer therapeutic
strategy for urologic malignancies [111]. In a pilot study (6
patients) with imatinib-resistant CML, rapamycin induced
major and minor leukocyte responses, with an observed
decrease in the mRNA levels of VEGFA in circulating
leukaemic cells [112]. Combination treatments for breast
cancer with aromatase inhibitor [113] and letrozol [114]
are also being evaluated. Rapamycin treatment brought
partial responses (>50% reduction in the absolute number
of blood blasts) and stable disease in adult refractory/
relapsed AML [115]. In a recent report, Deforolimus was
studied in a Phase 2 trial in pretreated patients with various
hematological malignancies, including ALL, AML, CLL,
CML, MDS, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, mantle
cell lymphoma and T-cell leukemia/lymphoma [116].
Overall, 40% of deforolimus-treated patients experienced
hematological improvement or stable disease.

Sorafenib (Nexavar®)
Sorafenib is an orally active inhibitor of VEGFR-1,
VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-ß, and Raf-1 tyrosine
kinase activity [90]. It has received the approval of FDA for
the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular
carcinoma [91] and advanced renal cell carcinoma [92].
However, not all advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
patients were able to tolerate sorafenib and some patients
experienced tumor progression [91]. Sorafenib has shown
improvements in PFS in patients with renal cell carcinoma
[93]. It is one of the aggressively studied drugs. According
to the NCI clinical trials search results, there are about
168 active clinical trials involving sorafenib in a variety
of cancers.

Sunitinib (Sutent®)
Sunitinib targets activity of multiple tyrosine kinases
such as VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR- ß, and
RET [94]. It is approved by FDA as Sunitinib malate for

Other Angiogenic Agents

newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, in combination with
dexamethasone. In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, the response
rate in patients receiving thalidomide plus dexamethasone
was 63% compared to 41% with dexamethasone alone
[127]. Long-term outcome measures, including timeto-progression (TTP) and PFS, were recently reported
for a 470 patient randomized, placebo-controlled Phase
3 clinical trial of a similar protocol in newly diagnosed
multiple myeloma, with comparable overall response rates
[128]. Significant increases resulted in both median TTP
and median PFS for the thalidomide plus dexamethasone
group versus dexamethasone alone.
Thalidomide was found to be moderately tolerated
and minimally effective in patients with histologically
proven advanced hepatocellular carcinoma [129].
Thalidomide provided no survival benefit for patients with
multiple, large, or midbrain metastases when combined
with WBRT (whole-brain radiation therapy) [130]. On

Bortezomib (Velcade®)
Is a proteasome inhibitor that disrupts signaling of
cancer cells, leading to cell death and tumor regression.
It is the first compound in its class to be used in clinical
practice. It has indirect anti-angiogenic properties [117].
While its exact mechanism is not understood, it induces
the pro-apoptotic BH3-only family member NOXA in a
p53 independent fashion triggering of a caspase cascade
culminating in apoptosis in melanoma and myeloma cells
[118]. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of myeloma
that has relapsed after two prior treatments (or where
resistance has developed following the last treatment).
It was also found to induce high quality responses as
third line salvage therapy with acceptable toxicity in
a significant proportion of homogeneously pre-treated
myeloma patients with progressive disease after autologous
transplantation and thalidomide. [119]. In a Phase 3 trial
involving 669 myeloma patients treated with at least one
prior therapy, bortezomib increased median, improved
overall survival, and increased response rate, compared
with high-dose dexamethasone [120]. In combination
with doxorubicin and gemcitabine, bortezomib was also
found to be effective in heavily pretreated, advanced
Cutaneous T cell Lymphomas (CTCL) [121]. Bortezomib
was also reported to be active as a single agent for patients
with relapsed/refractory CTCL and Peripheral T Cell
Lymphoma (PTCL) with skin involvement [122]. On the
contrary, the use of bortezomib was discouraged after a
phase II study revealed that found in combination with
dexamethasone, bortezomib is not active in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed Hodgkin’s lymphoma [123,
124].

the contrary, thalidomide did not significantly add
to the efficacy of the fludarabine, carboplatin, and

topotecan (FCT) regimen in poor prognosis AML patients
[131] and was also ineffective in improving prognosis

or decreasing plasma VEGF levels in patients with

persistent or recurrent leiomyosarcoma of the uterus [132].

METRONOMIC THERAPY
While conventional anti-angiogenic therapy is based
on Maximum Tolerated Doses (MTD), the cells involved
in angiogenesis may regenerate during the three- to
four-week interval between cycles of the chemotherapy.
Taking advantage of the fact that endothelial cells are
about 10–100 times more susceptible to chemotherapeutic
agents than cancer cells, therapy based on daily, oral, lowdose chemotherapeutic drugs was designed. Metronomic
chemotherapy refers to the close, rhythmic administration
of low doses of cytotoxic drugs, with minimal or no
drug-free breaks, over prolonged periods. Metronomic
therapy appears promising mainly due to the fact that
its anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic effects are
accompanied by low toxicity, limited side effects, no need
for hospitalization and allowing for feasible combinations
with selective inhibitors of angiogenesis. There are several
foreseeable advantages and opportunities for metronomic
chemotherapy: activity against the parenchymal and
stromal components, pro-apoptotic activity, reduction
of the likelihood of emergence of acquired resistance,
feasibility of long term administration and acceptable
systemic side effects [133]. In a pilot phase II study
conducted by Correale et al [134] to investigate the toxicity
and activity of the novel metronomic regimen of weekly
cisplatin and oral etoposide in high-risk patients with
NSCLC, the objective response rate was 45.2%, disease
control was 58.1%, meantime to progression and survival
were 9 and 13 months, respectively. Pharmacokinetic

Thalidomide (Thalomid®)
Possesses immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory,
and anti-angiogenic properties, although the precise
mechanisms of action are not fully understood.
Thalidomide was the first angiogenesis inhibitor to
demonstrate clinical efficacy in multiple myeloma [37,
125]. Specifically in myeloma, thalidomide downregulated VEGF secretion from bone marrow endothelial
cells obtained from patients with active disease. In a
landmark Phase 2 clinical trial, 169 previously treated
patients with refractory myeloma received thalidomide
monotherapy [126]. Partial response, was achieved
in 30% of patients, and 14% achieved a complete or
nearly complete remission. The survival rate at 2 years
was 48%. These results led to many subsequent clinical
studies of thalidomide in myeloma, leading ultimately to
FDA approval of the drug in 2006, for the treatment of

analysis showed that this regimen allowed a greater
median monthly area under the curve of the drugs than
conventional schedules. In a Phase I trial of metronomic
dosing of docetaxel and thalidomide, of the 26 patients
with advanced tumors enrolled, prolonged freedom
from disease progression was observed in 44.4% of the
evaluable patients [135].
Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)
also participate in tumor angiogenesis. In a study
comparing the effects of metronomic chemotherapy over
conventional dose-dense chemotherapy, it was found that
the numbers of circulating EPCs and the plasma levels of
VEGF increased sharply, doubling pre-therapeutic levels
at day 21 after conventional chemotherapy, whereas
under low-dose metronomic chemotherapy, the numbers
of circulating EPCs decreased significantly and VEGF
plasma concentrations remained unchanged. These
observations provide evidence that conventional dosedense chemotherapy leads to rebound EPC mobilization
even when given with adjuvant intention, while low-dose
metronomic scheduling of cytotoxic substances such as
trofosfamide may sharply reduce EPC release into the
circulation. [136].
Combined bevacizumab and metronomic oral
cyclophosphamide was also discovered to be a safe and
effective regimen for heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer
patients [137]. Treatment with metronomic capecitabine
and cyclophosphamide in combination with bevacizumab
was shown to be effective in advanced breast cancer and
additionally was minimally toxic [138]. Metronomic
treatment with carboplatin and vincristine associated
with fluvastatin and thalidomide significantly increased
survival of pediatric brain stem tumor patients. Tumor
volume showed a significant reduction accompanied by
increased quality of life [139]. Thus, given the fact that
the most evident effect of selective anti-angiogenic agents
(i.e. bevacizumab) is the significant prolonging of the
duration of response obtainable by chemotherapy alone,
with minimal possible side effects of cytotoxic agents
given in association metronomic chemotherapy should
be considered both as novel up-front or maintenance
treatment in patients with biologically poorly aggressive
advanced cancer diseases [140].
Overall, metronomic chemotherapy was able to
induce tumor stabilization and prolong the duration
of clinical benefit, without much associated toxicity.
Emerging evidence suggests that metronomic
chemotherapy could also activate the host immune system
and potentially induce tumor dormancy [141-143].

CONCLUSIONS
PERSPECTIVES

AND

cancer treatment, the overall benefits of anti-angiogenic
drugs from the perspective of impacting survival have
left much to desire, endorsing a need for developing
more effective therapeutic regimens e.g., combining
anti-angiogenic drugs with established chemotherapeutic
drugs [144, 145]. There are now several agents that target
the tumor vasculature through different pathways, either
by inhibiting formation of the tumor neovasculature or
by directly targeting the mature tumor vessels. The main
body of evolving evidence suggests that their effects are
compounded by their synergistic use with conventional
chemotherapy rather than individual agents. Antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab can bring about a
transient functional normalization of the tumor vasculature.
This can have an additive effect when co-administered
with chemo/radiotherapy. But long term inhibition of
angiogenesis reduces tumor uptake of co-administered
chemotherapeutic agents. This underscores the need for
discovering new targets for anti-angiogenic therapy in
order to effectively prohibit angiogenesis and circumvent
mechanisms that contribute to resistance mechanisms that
emerge with long term use of anti-angiogenic therapies. It
also warrants a need to define reliable surrogate indicators
of effectiveness of the anti-angiogenic therapy as well
as dependable markers for identifying the patients who
are most likely to benefit from the combination of antiangiogenic therapy and conventional chemotherapy.
Several new frontiers are emerging. New advances
in understanding endothelial cells, which constitute the
tumor vasculature, towards developing antiangiogenic
strategies are one of the important ones [146, 147].
Novel cellular targets such as integrins and microRNAs
and novel treatment options such as possible use of
pharmaconutrients to modulate angiogenic pathways
need careful testing and evaluation [148-151]. Finally,
the administration of these drugs in a metronomic
schedule is likely to improve the overall response to antiangiogenic drugs making it feasible to administer them
with conventionally toxic chemotherapeutic drugs, thus
increasing the armamentarium of drug combinations that
can be employed for treatment.
