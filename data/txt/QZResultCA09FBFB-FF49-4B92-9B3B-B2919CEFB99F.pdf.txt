Abstract

Author Manuscript

Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), the “gatekeeper” of glycolysis, catalyses the committed step of the
glycolytic pathway by converting fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
Allosteric activation and inhibition of PFK1 by over 10 metabolites and in response to hormonal
signaling fine-tune glycolytic flux to meet energy requirements1. Mutations inhibiting PFK1
activity cause glycogen storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease2, and mice deficient
in muscle PFK1 have decreased fat stores3. Additionally, PFK1 is suggested to have important
roles in metabolic reprograming in cancer4,5. Despite its critical role in glucose flux, the
biologically relevant crystal structure of the mammalian PFK1 tetramer has not been determined.
We report here the first structures of the mammalian PFK1 tetramer, for the human platelet
isoform (PFKP), in complex with ATP-Mg2+ and ADP at 3.1 and 3.4 Å, respectively. The
structures reveal substantial conformational changes in the enzyme upon nucleotide hydrolysis as
well as a unique tetramer interface. Mutations of residues in this interface can affect tetramer
formation, enzyme catalysis and regulation, indicating the functional importance of the tetramer.
With altered glycolytic flux being a hallmark of cancers6, these new structures allow a molecular
understanding of the functional consequences of somatic PFK1 mutations identified in human
cancers. We characterized three of these mutations and show they have distinct effects on
allosteric regulation of PFKP activity and lactate production. The PFKP structural blueprint for

somatic mutations as well as the catalytic site can guide therapeutic targeting of PFK1 activity to
control dysregulated glycolysis in disease.

Previous attempts to obtain the structure of mammalian tetrameric PFK1 used native protein
or recombinant protein generated in yeast or bacteria. A limitation of using native PFK1 is
that most mammalian tissues express all three isoforms – muscle (PFKM), liver (PFKL) and
platelet (PFKP)7. Although there are structures of PFK from prokaryotes8–11 and
eukaryotes12–14, including dimeric rabbit PFKM expressed in E. coli12, these structures
provide limited information on the catalytic interface or the conformational changes with
regulation of the tetrameic mammalian enzyme. To overcome current limitations with
structural studies of human PFK1, we produced recombinant PFKP by using a baculovirus
expression system. The recombinant enzyme, purified to homogeneity (Extended Data Fig.
1a), is tetrameric as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Fig. 1a). The
activity and regulation of recombinant PFKP, including high cooperativity for F6P, a high
affinity for ATP-Mg2+, and high sensitivity to ATP inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c),
was similar to previously reported mouse PFKP expressed in yeast15.
We determined the crystal structure of the PFKP tetramer in complex with ATP-Mg2+ at 3.1
Å resolution (Fig. 1b–d, Extended Data Fig. 2). The atomic model has good agreement with
the crystallographic data and the expected geometric parameters (Extended Data Table 1).
The asymmetric unit contained two tetramers, and the eight protomers have essentially the
same conformation (with rmsd of ~0.3 Å between any pair of them, Extended Data Fig. 3).
The overall organizations of the two tetramers are slightly different, reflected in part by
changes in the relative orientations of the two dimers (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Each PFKP tetramer measures 13.8 nm by 10.3 nm, similar in size and shape to what we
calculated from TEM images (Figs. 1a, 1b). The tetramer is composed of a dimer of dimers,
and the interface between the two dimers is relatively small, with a buried surface area of
700 Å2 for each subunit (arrow labeled “t” in Figs. 1b–c). The two subunits of the dimer are
arranged in an antiparallel orientation, confirming previous predictions16, with a buried
surface area of 1800 Å2 for each subunit. The active site is located at the interface between
the two subunits (arrow labeled “c” in Figs. 1b,1e).

The structure of PFKP likely represents the active conformation of the enzyme. The crystal
was prepared at pH 7, near physiological pH, and residues in the active site that are
important for substrate binding and/or catalysis have similar conformations in PFKP as in
other PFK structures (Fig. 1e). The F6P substrate, as observed in the S. cerevisiae PFK
(ScPFK) structure12, can be readily accommodated in the PFKP active site for catalysis. The
invariant substrate binding residues His208 and Arg210 from the second protomer of the
dimer are located ~6 Å away from F6P, suggesting that a closure of this region of the active
site may occur upon F6P binding and catalysis. PFKP contains only one ATP in each
subunit bound to the active site, despite the presence of 10 mM ATP during crystallization
and even though the allosteric adenine nucleotide-binding sites are functional (Extended
Data Fig. 1b,c). We also observed the binding of two phosphate groups in each protomer at
positions corresponding to the prokaryotic PFK effector sites (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). The
enzyme activity, regulation and stability of PFK1 is controlled by binding phosphate or

sulfate ions17,18. PFKP displayed a loss of ATP inhibition in the presence of 10 mM sodium
sulfate (Extended Data Fig. 2e) suggesting that phosphate-binding and inhibitory site ATPbinding are mutually exclusive in the tetrameric structure.

Author Manuscript

We also determined the crystal structure of PFKP in complex with ADP at 3.4 Å resolution,
at pH 7.5. The relatively low resolution of this structure precludes a detailed structural
comparison with that of the ATP-Mg2+ complex. However, it is clear there is a dramatic
change in the relative positions of the two domains in each protomer (Fig. 2a), and
especially the overall structures of the dimer and tetramer (Fig. 2b). A rotation of ~12° is
observed between the subdomains of the ADP complex protomer relatively to the ATP
complex, leading to an 8 Å shift in the substrate binding domain relative to the nucleotide
binding domain. An effect of this conformational change is to open the catalytic site (Figs.
2c, 2d), which may play a role in the release of products. The conformational changes
observed between the ATP and ADP complexes of PFKP are different from those seen for
the R- and T-states of bacterial PFK (Extended Data Fig. 4)8,19.

We tested the importance of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions at the tetramer
interface for enzyme activity (Fig. 3a). The majority of residues at the interface are
hydrophobic. Tyr645 and Phe649 from the two subunits form a π-stack of four aromatic side
chains in the interface, with Phe649 in the middle (Fig. 3a). Despite the overall similarities
in organization between the PFKP tetramer to that of ScPFK12, there are significant
differences in the tetramer interface between the two enzymes (Extended Data Fig. 5).
Phe649, which is evolutionarily conserved in metazoans but not in yeasts, is a leucine
residue in ScPFK α subunit. However, this Leu residue has a completely different local
environment in ScPFK compared to Phe649 in PFKP. We generated recombinant PFKP with
Phe649 mutated to Leu (Extended Data Fig. 6a) to test whether Phe649 is required for
tetramer formation. Previous studies showed that PFK1 assembles into tetramers in a
concentration- and ligand-dependent manner, with allosteric activators favoring the
formation of tetramers and allosteric inhibitors favoring the formation of dimers20–22. In a
buffer containing ADP, ATP and F6P, TEM showed that wild-type (WT) PFKP particles
had the dimensions and appearance of tetramers (Figs. 3b,c). In contrast, PFKP-F649L
particles were the same width but half the length of WT, consistent with dimer formation
along the catalytic interface (Fig. 3b,c; Extended Data Fig. 6b). We compared the PFKPF649L particles to those induced by the inhibitor citrate, which was shown to cause PFKM
to form dimers23. In a buffer containing 1 mM citrate, we saw two sizes of particles with
WT PFKP; one with dimensions of tetramers and the other with dimensions of dimers along
the catalytic interface (Fig. 3b,c; Extended Data Fig. 6c), further confirming dimer
formation by PFKP-F649L. The catalytic activity of PFKP-F649L was reduced 98%
(Extended Data Fig. 6d) compared with wild type enzyme, indicating that tetramer
formation is necessary for PFK1 activity.
The structures suggest that an electrostatic interaction at the tetramer interface between
Arg613 of one subunit and Glu657 of the adjacent subunit (Fig. 3a) may be important for
enzyme function. This salt bridge was only observed in the ATP-bound structure but not in
the ADP-bound PFKP structure or dimeric rabbit PFKM structures12, suggesting that it may
contribute to maintaining an active form of the mammalian tetramer. PFKP-E657A had

reduced affinity of ~4.5 mM for F6P, compared with ~0.8 mM in wild type, and an ~2-fold
decrease in maximum activity (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 6a and Table 2). Our data
indicate that hydrophobic interactions are essential for the formation of tetramers while
electrostatic interactions are required for optimal enzyme activity.

The structure of PFKP provides a foundation for understanding the functional effects of
somatic PFK1 mutations identified in cancers. Cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis to
provide energy and cellular building blocks required to support rapid proliferation6. PFK1
activity is increased in cancer cell lines and primary tumour tisues24 and expression of PFKP
is upregulated in breast25 and liver26 cancers. The effect of somatic mutations in PFK1 on
metabolic adaptation has not been reported. We mapped the 44 reported somatic mutations
in cancers27 that were not associated with SNPs28 onto the structure of PFKP (Fig. 4a,
Extended Data Table 3). Analysis by Mutation Assessor29 predicted that 28 of these
mutations would alter enzyme activity.

We selected three identified somatic mutations for biochemical analysis. Arg48 interacts
with a bound phosphate ion in the structure (Fig. 4b), and the R48C mutant had reduced
citrate inhibition, shifting E50Citrate from 0.4 mM for wild type to greater than 4 mM (Fig.
4d) but did not markedly change effects of ATP and F6P (Fig. 4e–f, Extended Data Table 2).
Analogous mutations in PFKM have been described in Tarui disease30,20. These data
indicate that Arg48 is located in the citrate-binding site, which is occupied by the phosphate
ion in the current structure30. A serine substitution for Asn426, located close to the catalytic
interface, is predicted to disrupt interactions with the backbone carbonyls of Gln472,
Gly473, and Gly474 and the main-chain amide of Ile476, which are involved in positioning
a loop at the catalytic interface (Fig. 4c). The N426S mutant partially relieves ATP
inhibition, shifting EC50ATP from ~1 mM to greater than 3 mM (Fig. 4e). Located across the
catalytic interface from Asn426, Asp564 forms an electrostatic interaction with Arg319 (Fig.
4b). The D564N mutant had decreased maximum velocity and affinity for F6P (Fig. 4f,
Extended Data Table 2). We also stably expressed PFKP wild type and mutants tagged with
GFP in MTLn3 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells (Extended Data 7b). In cell lysates,
PFK1 activity was greater with expression of wild type, N426S, and D564N but not R48C
compared with untransfected or GFP controls (Extended Data 7c). Lactic acid excretion was
also greater with cells expressing wild type and N426S but significantly less with D564N
compared with GFP controls (Fig. 4g). Inhibition of glycolytic flux by loss of function
mutations, such as D564N, may confer a selective advantage for cancer cell growth and
metastasis by redirecting carbon flow through the pentose phosphate pathway, similar to that
observed by glycosylation-dependent PFK1 inhibition4. However, relief of inhibition by
allosteric regulators had no effect on lactate production in the glutamine-free cell culture
conditions we used. This finding could reflect the ability of PFK1 to dynamically alter
metabolic states by integrating multiple signals. Additionally, the functional significance of
selective PFKP mutations will depend on the mutational signature of the respective cancer in
which they occur as well as the relative expression of other PFK1 isoforms.
In addition to cancer, aberrant glycolytic flux is increasingly recognized to contribute to a
number of other diseases such as obesity, diabetes and Tarui disease. The biologically
relevant tetrameric structures of the PFKP provide information on the catalytic interface and

understanding of the functional impact of disease-associated mutations. Additionally, these
new structural insights will enable rational drug design for therapeutic development.

Homo sapiens PFKP cDNA (NM_002627.4) encoding the 784 amino acid isoform 1 was
cloned into the pFastBac HTa vector and baculovirus was generated using the Bac-to-Bac
Expression system (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) as per manufacturer protocols. 2×109
sf21 or Hi5 cells were used to express PFKP at a multiplicity of infection of 1 for 48 hours.
Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(Tris-HCl; pH 7.5); 50 mM potassium phosphate; 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol; 10% glycerol;
10 mM imidazole; cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche)) and lysed with 15
passes of a dounce homogenizer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the pellet
discarded. The supernatant was incubated with Talon resin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA),
washed with 20 bed volumes of lysis buffer, and eluted with a minimal volume of elution
buffer (lysis buffer with 100 mM imidazole). Protein was concentrated using an Amicon
Ultracel-30K Centrifugal Filter Unit (Milipore, Billerica, MA) and buffer exchanged into
FPLC buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM
MgCl2, and 5 % glycerol). PFKP was passed over a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and the peak corresponding to the tetrameric fraction collected.
Buffer was exchanged to crystallization buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KC, 1 mM
TCEP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 5 % glycerol) containing either 10 mM ADP or 10 mM ATP
using an Amicon Ultracel-30K Centrifugal Filter Unit and recombinant PFKP concentrated
to >5 mg/ml. Protein was stored at 4°C. Recombinant PFKP was tested for activity and
allosteric regulation prior to crystallization.
PFK1 activity assays

Author Manuscript

Activity assays for PFK1 were preformed using an auxiliary enzyme assay31. Kinetic studies
were performed in 200 μl reaction containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM
MgCl2, 0.15 mM NADH, 0.675 units/ml aldolase, 5 units/ml triosephosphate isomerase, and
2 units/ml glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase. ATP and fructose 6-phosphate were used as
indicated. Auxiliary enzymes were desalted using an Amicon Ultracel-10K Centrifugal
Filter Unit prior to use. The concentration of PFKP was normalized and samples diluted as a
10X stock in 10% glycerol, 20mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1mM DTT immediately prior to
the assay. The temperature was equilibrated to 25°C for 10 minutes prior to initiating the
reaction with the addition of PFKP. The absorbance at 340 nm was measured using a
SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Kinetic parameters
were generated by linear regression analysis of the Hill equation using Prism (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA) and are the average of a minimum of 3 measurements from 2
independent preparations of protein (R2 >0.95 for all analyses). An unpaired t-test with
equal variance was used to compare the activity of wild type and F649L PFKP. One unit (U)
of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate per minute at 25°C. Data on the effect of sulfate on PFK1 activity

Transmission Electron Microscopy

Author Manuscript

20 μl of 25 μg/ml PFKP was applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated grids and stained
with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Grids were examined and photographed with a JEOL 100CX
II (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). For estimation of size of PFKP dimers and tetramers, the length
and width of individual particles from TEM images were measured using FIJI ImageJ
software32. The average length and width ± SD are reported. For experiments analyzing the
shape and size of PFKP for crystallography studies, the protein was diluted in TEM buffer
(20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 %
glycerol). For experiments analyzing the oligomeric state of the enzyme in the presence of
activators, WT and F649L PFKP were diluted in TEM buffer containing 3mM ADP, 3mM
ATP and 8mM F6P. For experiments analyzing the oligomeric state of the enzyme in the
presence of inhibitors, PFKP was diluted in TEM buffer containing 1mM citrate.
Crystallization and structure determination

Author Manuscript

PFKP was crystallized in two different complexes of ADP and ATP-Mg2+ by a microbatch
method at 18°C. For the ADP complex, 2 μl of protein solution containing PFKP (6.35
mg/ml) was mixed with 1 μl of the precipitant solution consisting of 200 mM potassium
sodium tartrate tetrahydrate, pH 7.4, and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350. The same protein buffer was
used for growing the crystals of the PFKP in complex with ATP and Mg2+. The crystals
were obtained using microbatch method and the precipitant solution comprising 200 mM
potassium thiocyanate, pH 7, and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350. All crystals were cryoprotected by
addition of 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol in the respective mother liquor and flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen for data collection at 100 K.

Author Manuscript

Crystals of the PFKP complexes both belong to space group P21. However, the
crystallographic asymmetric unit of the ADP-bound form contains 4 subunits of PFKP that
are assembled as one tetramer, whereas that of ATP-Mg2+ form contains two tetramers. A
single-wavelength native data set to resolution 3.1 Å was collected at the X4C beamline of
the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). The diffraction images were processed with
the HKL package33. The structure of PFK from rabbit skeletal muscle (PDB id: 3O8L)12
was used to determine the ATP-Mg2+ structure of PFKP using the molecular replacement
method, with the program MolRep34. Only a monomeric model of PFK from rabbit skeletal
muscle resulted in a solution, which led to structure determination of the ATP-bound PFKP
structure. The remaining of the PFKP model was built manually with the program
XtalView35. The structure refinement was performed with CNS36. A similar methodology
was used for data collection and processing of the ADP-bound structure of PFKP, the crystal
of which diffracted to 3.4 Å at the X4C beamline of NSLS. The ADP-bound structure was
subsequently determined using a monomeric model of the ATP-bound complex of PFKP,
with the program MolRep34 followed by structure refinement by CNS36. The data
processing and refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. The
Ramachandran plots suggest that 85.4% and 74.9% of residues in ATP-bound complex and
ADP-bound complex of PFKP are in most favored regions, and there is no residue in

ADP-bound structures was generated using UCSF Chimera40. The structures were aligned
with Matchmaker tool and the trajectory calculated with the Morph Conformation tool.
Selection of cancer mutations and generation of point mutants
Somatic mutations identified in human cancers were selected from the COSMIC database27
and known SNPs were disregarded28. The mutations were modeled onto the structure of
PFKP and selected for further analysis. Point mutants at the tetramer interface, F649L and
E657A, and cancer mutants, R48C N426S, and D564N, were generated by using a
commercially available site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange Lightning, Aligent, Santa
Clara, CA). DNA primers were designed using the online primer design tool (http://
www.genomics.agilent.com/primerDesignProgram.jsp) and purchased from Elim
Biopharmaceuticals (Hayword, CA).

Analysis of cells expressing PFKP

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A mammalian PFKP expression construct was generated by PCR amplification and the
cDNA inserted into the multiple cloning site of pEGFP-N1 using the restriction enzymes
XhoI and BamHI. Cancer mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as
described above. Constructs were expressed by transfecting MTLn3 rat mammary
adenocarcinoma cells37 using FugeneHD (Promega, Madison WI) transfection reagent. One
day post-transfection cells were replated into 100 mm dishes and 800 μg/ml G418 was
added to select for transfected cells. After one week of selection, FACS was used to sort
cells expressing GFP. For metabolic assays, cells were seeded into a 6-well plate at a density
of 3 × 105 cell per well. One day after replating, cells were washed twice in serum- and
glutamine-free media and cells were incubated for 2 hours in 1 ml of the same media. 50 μl
of the media was collected in triplicate and the amount of lactic acid in the media measured
using an enzyme-linked assay38. 100 μl of Reagent A (300 mM hydrazine; 200 mM glycine,
pH 9.5; 20 mM β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and 50 μl of Reagent B (200 U/ml Llactate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis MO) were added to
each well and incubated for one hour at room temperature. The absorbance at 340 nm was
measured and the amount of lactate was determined from a standard curve. Cells were lysed
in buffer (10mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5; 0.1% Triton X-100; cOmplete Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche)), cellular debris removed by centrifugation, and the protein
concentration determined by the Bradford method. Lactic acid levels in the media were
normalized to protein concentration. PFK1 activity assays were preformed on the lysate as
previously described39. Enzyme-linked PFK1 activity assays were performed on 10 μg of
total cell lysate as described above with the exception that 10 mM ammonium sulphate was
added to the assay mixture and the auxiliary enzymes were not desalted. Levels of PFKP
expression were determined by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen A-11122,
1DB-001-0000868907) and mouse anti-actin clone C4 (ED Millipore MAB1501,
1DB-001-0000850281) antibodies. Two-sided paired t-tests were used to determine
statistical significance.
