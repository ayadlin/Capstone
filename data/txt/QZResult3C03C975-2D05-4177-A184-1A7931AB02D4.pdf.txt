ABSTRACT
Mutation of oncogene KRAS is common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
however, its clinical significance is still controversial. Independent studies evaluating
its prognostic and predictive value usually drew inconsistent conclusions. Hence,
We performed a meta-analysis with 41 relative publications, retrieved from multidatabases, to reconcile these controversial results and to give an overall impression of
KRAS mutation in NSCLC. According to our findings, KRAS mutation was significantly
associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in early
stage resected NSCLC (hazard ratio or HR=1.56 and 1.57, 95% CI 1.39-1.76 and 1.172.09 respectively), and with inferior outcomes of epidermal growth factor receptortyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) treatment and chemotherapy (relative risk or
RR=0.21 and 0.66 for objective response rate or ORR, 95% CI 0.12-0.39 and 0.54-0.81
respectively; HR=1.46 and 1.30 for progression-free survival or PFS, 95%CI 1.231.74 and 1.14-1.50 respectively) in advanced NSCLC. When EGFR mutant patients
were excluded, KRAS mutation was still significantly associated with worse OS and
PFS of EGFR-TKIs (HR=1.40 and 1.35, 95 % CI 1.21-1.61 and 1.11-1.64). Although
KRAS mutant patients presented worse DFS and PFS of chemotherapy (HR=1.33
and 1.11, 95% CI 0.97-1.84 and 0.95-1.30), and lower response rate to EGFR-TKIs
or chemotherapy (RR=0.55 and 0.88, 95 % CI 0.27-1.11 and 0.76-1.02), statistical
differences were not met. In conclusion, KRAS mutation is a weak, but valid predictor
for poor prognosis and treatment outcomes in NSCLC. There’s a need for developing
target therapies for KRAS mutant lung cancer and other tumors.

for NSCLC couldn’t be more popular. Besides EGFR,
KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in NSCLC
(15-20%) with most cases affect exon 2 and 3 (G12, G13
and Q61). It seemed that KRAS mutation occurs more
frequently in lung adenocarcinomas (approximately 30%),
in the Caucasian population, and in the population with
smoking history [4–6].
KRAS mutation was described as a negative
prognostic marker for OS and DFS in lung
adenocarcinoma more early in 1990 [7]. Not until the
last ten years, clinical significance of KRAS mutation
in NSCLC has been attracted more and more attention.
Although a lot of published studies reported that KRAS

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer, with NSCLC accounts for 85% of all
cases, is the most common human malignant disease and the
leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [1, 2].
Early as the beginning of this century, novel molecular
targeted agents like EGFR-TKIs represented by gefitinib
or erlotinib, which interfere with EGFR signaling, have
been proved dramatically effective for selected advanced
NSCLC patients with sensitive EGFR mutations [3].
Since then, molecular target therapies provided promising
treatment alternatives to surgery, radiation therapy and
chemotherapy. Personalized, genotype-directed therapy

mutation is associated with poor prognosis and outcomes
of EGFR-TKIs treatment [8–11] and chemotherapy [10,
12–15], more than a few independent studies argued
that it predicts neither worse prognosis [8, 10–12, 14,
16–28] nor inferior outcomes of EGFR-TKIs treatment
or chemotherapy [14, 18, 19, 29–32]. Therefore, we
carried out a comprehensively search and review of
relevant publications in multi-database. Useful data was
extracted and then aggregated by using a meta-analysis
methodology to give an overall impression of KRAS
mutation in NSCLC.
Moreover, it is accepted that sensitive EGFR
mutation predicts benefit from EGFR-TKIs treatment
and even from chemotherapy in NSCLC [8, 9, 18, 19,
26, 32-34]. Mutations of KRAS and EGFR are common
and mutually exclusive in NSCLC [35–37]. Thus EGFR
mutation predominantly coexists with wild type KRAS,
which made us overestimate the prognostic and predictive
value of KRAS mutation. Therefore, analyses were reperformed in EGFR wild-type NSCLC to obtain objective
and unassertive conclusions.

eligible for inclusion in the present analyses. The process
of selecting publications was presented in Figure 1 and
the clinical characteristics of the included studies were
listed in Table 1. All of the studies were published from
2005-2015, consisting of 40 cohort studies [8–31, 34, 35,
38-51] and one randomized controlled trial (RCT)[32].
Thirty studies [8, 9, 11–19, 21–28, 31, 35, 38, 40–43,
46–48, 51] conducted in Europe and North America, ten
studies [10, 20, 29, 30, 32, 34, 39, 44, 45, 50] in Asia,
and one study [49] in Latin America. All of the studies
focused on NSCLC or lung adenocarcinoma only except
one [46] on lung squamous cell carcinoma. Ten studies
[16, 20, 24, 25, 29, 30, 39, 43, 47, 48] dealt with stage
I-IIIa resected tumors, twenty-nine studies [8, 9, 11–15,
17–19, 21–23, 26–28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 40–42, 44–46,
49–51] with stage IIIb-IV unresectable tumors, and two
studies [10, 32] with all stage tumors. Thirteen studies
[10, 12, 13, 18, 29, 30, 34, 35, 41, 44, 46, 47, 49] used
a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or modified PCR
method to test gene mutation, while the others used a
direct sequencing method. Four studies [12, 13, 38, 45]
assessed KRAS mutation in plasma DNA and the others
in tumor specimens. In consistent with large-scaled
demographic results [6], the majority of KRAS mutation
occurs in codon 12, with G12C the most, occasionally in
codon 13, and rarely in codon 61. All the studies selected
patients randomly without concerning gender or smoking
status and most results were adjusted for gender, age,
stage and Karnofsky performance score.

The quality of cohort study was assessed using the
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) on three perspectives:
patient selection, comparability of groups, and assessment
of outcome. Full score is nine stars, and a study with more
stars was considered to be of higher quality. Quality scores
of 40 cohort studies ranged from six to nine with a median
score of eight. The quality of RCT was assessed using the
Jadad Scale on three perspectives: randomization, double
blinding, withdraws and dropouts. Full score is five points,
and a study with score no less than three points is defined
the high-quality study. The only included RCT gained a
score of three points. No “poor quality” study was found
and all of the studies were considered acceptable for
inclusion in the present meta-analysis. The study specific
scores were summarized in Table S1.

Nine studies [10, 24, 25, 29, 30, 32, 43, 47, 48] dealt
with stage I-IIIa resected NSCLC and provided HRs for
DFS comparing KRAS mutant tumors with KRAS wild-type
tumors. All cases received R0 resection and lobectomies
were performed mostly. Pooled HR was 1.57 for DFS
(95% CI 1.17-2.09, p=0.002) (Figure 2D), indicating
an increased hazard for disease recurrence after tumor
resection for KRAS mutant patients. Neither significant
heterogeneity (I2 =47.6%, p=0.054) nor publication bias
(Begg’s test p=0.754, Egger’s test p=0.062) (Figure 2E)
was detected. However, meta-regression analysis showed
that significant heterogeneity did exist between two races
(adjusted R2=-85.65%, p=0.042). Similarly, subgroup
analysis according to race showed that KRAS mutation is
a more powerful negative prognostic factor for DFS in the
Asians (HR=2.59, 95% CI 1.55-4.30 and p=0.00, I2=0.0%
and p=0.847 for heterogeneity) than in the Caucasians
(HR=1.31, 95% CI 0.99-1.73 and p=0.057, I2=42.7% and
p=0.137 for heterogeneity) (Figure 2D).
Eighteen studies [9–11, 17–19, 21, 22, 31, 32, 34,
35, 40–42, 46, 49, 51] investigated outcomes (response
rate or PFS) of EGFR-TKIs treatment in stage IIIb-IV
unresectable NSCLC comparing KRAS mutant tumors
with KRAS wild-type tumors. Either gefitinib or erlotinib
was administered in standard dosage as first to threeline treatment. The total ORR (complete response or
CR + partial response or PR) was 2.5% (6/237) in KRAS
mutant patients and 34.0% (499/1469) in KRAS wild-type
patients. Pooled RR was 0.21 for ORR (95% CI 0.120.39, p=0.00) (Figure 3A) while pooled HR was 1.46 for
PFS (95% CI 1.23-1.74, p=0.0) (Figure 3D), indicating
a significant lower response rate and shorter remission
period of EGFR-TKIs treatment for KRAS mutant patients.
Neither significant heterogeneity (I2=0.0%, p=0.876 and
I2 =44.3%, p=0.033 respectively) nor publication bias
(Begg’s test p=0.502, Egger’s test p=0.086 and Begg’s test
p=0.06, Egger’s test p=0.053 respectively) (Figure 3B and
3E) was detected. Meta-regression analysis showed that
neither race (p=0.440) nor gene mutation testing method
(p=0.807) contributes significantly to the heterogeneity.
Thirteen studies [8, 10, 12–15, 27, 32, 34, 41, 49–
51] investigated outcomes of chemotherapy in stage IIIbIV unresectable NSCLC comparing KRAS mutant tumors
with KRAS wild-type tumors. Platinum-based doublet
was used for first to second-line treatment. The total ORR
was 21.1% (82/389) in KRAS mutant patients and 32.9%
(486/1477) in KRAS wild-type patients. Pooled RR was
0.66 for ORR (95% CI 0.54-0.81, p=0.00) (Figure 4A)
while pooled HR was 1.30 for PFS (95% CI 1.14-1.50,
p=0.0) (Figure 4D), indicating a significant lower response
and shorter remission period of chemotherapy for KRAS
mutant patients. Neither significant heterogeneity
(I2=0.0%, p=0.949 and I2 =23.8%, p=0.203 respectively)
nor publication bias (Begg’s test p=0.755, Egger’s
test p=0.506 and Begg’s test p=0.583, Egger’s test
p=0.419 respectively) (Figure 4B and 4E) was detected.

KRAS mutation and clinical features
Data of clinical features stratified by KRAS
mutational status was reported in 25 studies [9, 10, 12–17,
21, 23, 24, 26–28, 30, 32, 34, 39, 41, 44–48, 50]. Data
was extracted from individual studies and then aggregated.
The result indicated that KRAS mutation occurs more
frequently in lung adenocarcinoma (RR=1.16 p=0.016),
and in former or current smokers (RR=1.13 p=0.017),
but not in male gender (RR=1.07 p=0.142) (Table S2).
Reported gene mutation rate ranged from 4.4% to 24.5%
in the Asians and from 6.7% to 47.4% in the Caucasians.
Additionally, an increased incidence of presence of stage
IV disease and distant metastasis in KRAS mutant patients
was reported in several studies [27, 50].

Prognostic and predictive value of KRAS
mutation in unselected NSCLC
Thirty-seven studies [8, 10–29, 31, 32, 34, 38–42,
44–51] provided HRs for OS comparing KRAS mutant
NSCLC with KRAS wild-type NSCLC. Pooled HR was
1.56 for OS (95%CI 1.39-1.76, p=0.00) (Figure 2A),
indicating a significantly worse survival for KRAS
mutant patients. Significant heterogeneity among
studies (I2 =54.6%, p=0.00) and publication bias (Begg’s
test p=0.053, Egger’s test p=0.014) (Figure 2B) was
detected. Meta-regression analysis showed that only
race (adjusted R2=77.12%, p=0.00) might contribute to
the heterogeneity, but not other factors such as disease
stage (p=0.885), pathology (p=0.454), gene mutation
testing method (p=0.029) and specimens (plasma/tumor
foci) for mutation assessment (p=0.560). As shown in
Figure 2A, subgroup analysis according to race showed
that KRAS mutation is a more powerful negative
prognostic factor for OS in the Asians (HR=2.39 with
95% CI 1.97-2.90 and p=0.00, I2=0.0% and p=0.648 for
heterogeneity) than in the Caucasians (HR=1.37 with
95%CI 1.24-1.51 and p=0.00, I2=30.5 and p=0.066 for
heterogeneity).

of KRAS and EGFR were mutually exclusive in most cases
[35–37], presence of both gene mutations could be seen
occasionally [18, 34, 47].
As shown in Figure 5A, pooled HR was 1.40 for OS
(95% CI 1.21-1.61, p=0.0) based on 21 studies [10, 11, 15,

bias (Begg’s test p=0.866, Egger’s test p=0.486) (Figure
S1A) was detected. Similarly, meta-regression analysis
showed that only races (adjusted R2=95.14%, p=0.0)
might contribute to the heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis
according to races showed that KRAS mutation impairs
survival more seriously in the Asians (HR=2.30 with
95% CI 1.84-2.88 and p=0.0, I2=6.1% and p=0.381 for
heterogeneity) than in the Caucasians (HR=1.22 with
95% CI 1.11-1.33 and p=0.00, I2=0.0% and p=0.653 for

As shown in Figure 5B, pooled HR was 1.33 for

[10, 24, 25, 32, 43, 47] conducted in stage I-IIIa resected
NSCLC comparing KRAS mutant tumors with KRAS

showed that neither race (p=0.159) nor gene mutation

heterogeneity.
The total ORR to chemotherapy was 35.8%
(138/385) in KRAS mutant patients and 45.1% (381/845) in
KRAS and EGFR wild-type patients based on eight studies
[8, 10, 15, 27, 28, 32, 50, 51] conducted in stage IIIb-IV
unresectable NSCLC. As shown in Figure 6C and 6D,
pooled RR was 0.88 for ORR (95% CI 0.76-1.02, p=0.083)
while pooled HR was 1.11 for PFS (95% CI 0.95-1.30,

contribute significantly to the heterogeneity.

In general, no individual publication was found to
be significantly biasing the results (Figure 2C, 2F, 3C, 3F,
4C, 4F and Figure S2A-D), but the associations between
KRAS mutation with lower response rate and shorter
remission period of chemotherapy in EGFR wild-type
NSCLC were affected after the data set of Mihaly [28]
was removed (Figure S2E, S2F). The associations shifted
from statistically insignificant to significant with Mihaly et
al.’s study excluded. However, this study enrolled the most
patients assessed for outcomes of chemotherapy and gained
a high quality score of nine stars, therefor it’s unreasonable
to role out this study for analyses. The sensitivity analyses
showed that the cumulative results are stable.

DISCUSSION
The KRAS oncogene together with HRAS and
NRAS encode a family of membrane-bound 21kd
guanosine triphosphate binding proteins (GTPs) that

Resistance to EGFR-TKIs treatment for KRAS
mutant NSCLC was also reported in other two metaanalysis conducted by Chen et al. [56] and Min et al. [57].
The reported pooled RR for ORR was 0.29 (95% CI 0.180.47) in Chen’s study and 0.21 (95% CI 0.12-0.39) in ours
while the reported pooled HR for PFS was 1.86 (95% CI
1.51-2.29) in Min’s study and 1.46 (95% CI 1.23-1.74)
in ours, showing highly consistent results among studies.
Meanwhile, the present meta-analysis included more
publications and presented more accurate confidence
interval. Resistance to chemotherapy for KRAS mutant
NSCLC was also reported by another meta-analysis [58].
The reported odds ratio (OR) was 0.67 (95% CI 0.50-0.88)
for ORR with statistical significance and 0.75 (95% CI
0.54-1.04) for 6 month and 1-year PFS rate but without
statistical significance. Only first-line chemotherapy was
evaluated. We doubt that HR might be more suitable than
OR for analyzing PFS, which displayed an abnormal
distribution. Our results showed both significant inferior
ORR (RR=0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.88) and PFS (HR=1.30,
95% CI 1.14-1.50) for the KRAS mutant patients.
Additionally, we noticed that KRAS mutation
impairs OS and DFS more obviously in the Asians
(HR=2.39 and 2.59 respectively) than in the Caucasians
(HR=1.37 and 1.31 respectively), which is not reported
elsewhere. It is believed that KRAS mutation subtypes
have diverse prognosis and respond differently to
chemotherapy or EGFR-TKIs [15, 25, 28, 47, 48, 59].
The author speculated that different spectrum of KRAS
mutation subtypes, especially increased proportion of G13,
G12D and G12V in the Asians, might be partly responsible
for the different hazard ratio between two races. Secondly,
there were more KRAS wild-type cases than KRAS mutant
cases enrolled in studies. This unbalanced situation was
more obviously in studies conducted in Asia, which
might exaggerate the HRs for OS and DFS in the Asians.
More detailed mechanisms need to be exploited in future
fundamental research focused on divergence of RAS
signal transduction between two races.
Besides KRAS, oncogene EGFR is also frequently
mutated in NSCLC, which predicts dramatic benefits
from EGFR-TKIs treatment [3, 8, 17–20, 23, 31], and
even from chemotherapy [32, 49]. Mutations of KRAS
and EGFR are generally mutually exclusive in NSCLC,
i.e. most EGFR mutations were existed in KRAS wildtype patients, which might bias the results toward an
overestimation of the prognostic and predictive value
of KAS mutation. Thus, we carried out further analyses
in EGFR wild-type NSCLC to draw a more objective
conclusion of clinical significance of KRAS mutation.
While compared with KRAS and EGFR wild-type
NSCLC, the prognostic and predictive value of KRAS
mutation did decreased. Pooled HR decreased from 1.56
and 1.57 to 1.40 and 1.33 for OS and DFS respectively,
yet statistically significant for OS (p=0.0) but not for
DFS (p=0.076). Similarly, KRAS mutation impaired

regulate cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis by
interacting with multiple signaling including mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT), and phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascades [52]. KRAS gene has
been found frequently mutated in human tumors such
as large intestine, lung and pancreas. Almost all KRASmutant cases affect exon 2 and 3 (G12, G13 and Q61),
which impair the deactivation circuit of RAS proteins,
thereby causing sustained activation of RAS signaling
[53]. Meanwhile RAS is the most important downstream
effector of EGFR, therefore sensitive mutation of KRAS
gene might attenuate, even abolish the treatment efficacy
of anti-EGFR agents such as EGFR-TKIs and EGFR
monoclonal antibody (EGFR mAb). It is true that the
benefit of cetuximab or panitumumab, two well-known
EGFR mAb approved by FDA, is restricted to patients
with KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer, and only this
subset of patients should receive these agents [54].
Although KRAS is the most common mutated oncogene
in NSCLC, its clinical significance is yet under debate.
Should we test for it, and does it matter? Is KRAS testing
necessary before EGFR-TKIs treatment?
The present meta-analysis with newest and largest
quantity of relevant publications confirmed that KRAS
mutation is significantly associated with worse OS
(HR=1.56) and DFS (HR=1.57), and also with inferior
ORR (RR=0.21 and 0.66 for TKI and chemotherapy
respectively) and PFS (HR=1.46 and 1.30 respectively) of
EGFR-TKIs treatment or chemotherapy, compared with
KRAS wild-type NSCLC. While analyzing the association
between KRAS mutation with OS, significant publication
bias was detected by Egger’s test (p=0.014). Thereby, a
“trim and fill” method was applied. Elven hypothetical
negative unpublished studies were imputed to produce a
symmetrical funnel plot (Figure S3). The pooled analysis
incorporating the hypothetical studies continued to show
a statistically significant association between KRAS
mutation and worse survival (HR=1.31, 95% CI 1.141.50 and p=0.00). Céline et al. [55] reported a significant
worse survival (HR=1.35, 95% CI 1.16-1.56) of KRAS
mutant NSCLC compared with KRAS wild-type NSCLC
based on a meta-analysis of 28 studies early in 2004. The
reported HR for OS was quit similar to ours, however, no
significant survival hazard was observed in the subgroup
analysis of nine studies using an immunohistochemistry
(IHC) method to test RAS alternation (HR=1.08, 95% CI
0.86-1.34). Furthermore, none of the 28 studies used a
direct sequencing method, which is a “gold standard” for
gene testing and not spreading to clinical application until
the last decade. On the contrary, none of the 41 studies
included in the present meta-analysis used an IHC method.
Instead, more than half of the included studies used a
direct sequencing method. As more included studies, more
enrolled cases and more developed gene testing method,
our results are more reliable.

In conclusion, KRAS mutation is a weak, but valid
predictor for poor prognosis and treatment outcomes for
surgical resection, EGFR-TKIs treatment or chemotherapy.
Its prognostic and predictive value is greatly impaired
when EGFR mutant patients were excluded. One thing
for sure is that it closely related to a worse survival
irrespective of EGFR mutational status especially for
the Asians. So far, no effective treatment method direct
targeting mutant KRAS gene has been approved in clinic.
Agents interrupting RAS signaling such as MEK inhibitor
[62–64] or miR-126 [65] seemed selective effective for
KRAS mutant tumors, which could be utilized for the
development of target therapy for KRAS mutant tumors
and might overcome the survival hazard induced by KRAS
mutation.

OS and DFS (without statistical significance, data not
shown) more seriously in the Asians. Pooled RR for
ORR increased from 0.21 and 0.66 to 0.55 and 0.88 for
EGFR-TKIs treatment and chemotherapy respectively.
No statistical significances were observed (p=0.095
and 0.813 respectively). Pooled HR for PFS decreased
from 1.46 and 1.30 to 1.35 and 1.11 for EGFR-TKIs
treatment and chemotherapy respectively. Statistical
significance was observed in EGFR-TKIs treatment
(p=0.002), but not in chemotherapy (p=0.186). Although
associations of KRAS mutation with inferior treatment
outcomes turned out to be statistically insignificant, the
results seemed unstable. Sensitivity analyses showed
that the associations of KRAS mutation with inferior
chemotherapy outcomes were significantly affected after
Mihaly et al.’s study was removed. It is noteworthy that
there were fewer studies evaluating the associations of
KRAS mutation with treatment outcomes in EGFR wildtype NSCLC. Besides, obvious trends towards inferior
treatment outcomes and borderline confidence intervals
were observed, the author speculated that KRAS
mutation is still a valid predictor for poor treatment
outcomes in EGFR wild-type NSCLC with more
publications to be included. However, its prognostic
and predictive value is not so remarkable as it was
greatly affected by exclusion of EGFR mutant patients
and the HRs for OS, DFS and PFS were no more than
two fold. Actually only NSCLC patients with sensitive
EGFR mutation are recommend to first line EGFR-TKIs
treatment according to NCCN Guidelines. Based on the
notion that mutations of EGFR and KRAS are generally
mutually exclusive, a very few KRAS mutant patients
are subjected to EGFR-TKIs treatment. Therefore KRAS
testing is of limited value to optimize the use of EGFRTKIs in clinic compared to EGFR testing.
Despite our efforts in performing a comprehensive and
accurate analysis, yet several limitations should be taken into
consideration when interpreting the findings. Firstly, fewer
studies assed the predictive and prognostic value of KRAS
mutation in EGFR wild-type NSCLC. Thus borderline
significant associations of KRAS mutation with inferior
treatment outcomes were observed. Secondly, the present
study is a univariate analysis. Although several factors such
as race, stage, gene testing method and EGFR mutational
status were taken into consideration, other factors such as
KRAS mutation subtypes, other gene mutational status as
ALK rearrangement [10, 15] and PIK3CA mutation [21,
42, 46, 60], performance status and smoking status should
not be neglected in the analysis with more available data
provided in the future studies. Lastly, it is noteworthy that
KRAS mutation, and even subtype-specific KRAS mutations,
responds differently to different chemotherapeutics [34, 61].
Therefore, associations between subtype-specific KRAS
mutations and responses to specific chemotherapeutics
should be strictly exploited in future studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Publication search and selection
The identification of potential relevant studies
was performed through a systemic search in PubMed,
Embase and Web of Science databases using the following
keywords “lung cancer”, “non-small cell lung cancer” or
“NSCLC” and “KRAS”. The latest search was updated on
September 2015. Bibliographies of eligible studies, review
articles and other relevant publications were also reviewed
to identify all potential studies.
A study had to fulfill the following criteria: (1)
to deal with non-small cell lung cancer (any stage); (2)
to stratified by KRAS mutational status; (3) to assess
the correlation between KRAS mutation and survival or
treatment outcome (surgery, EGFR-TKIs, platinum-based
chemotherapy); (4) to have been published as a full paper
in the English language and in the last ten years (20052015). The studies were excluded from the analysis if any
of the cases occurred: (a) EGFR-TKIs and platinum-based
chemotherapy were used as neo-adjuvant treatment; (b)
critical information was missing or could not be obtained
by our repeated quests.

Data extraction
Two investigators (Wei Pan and Yan Yang)
independently screened the studies and extracted the data
from included studies by using standard data-abstraction
forms. Disagreements were resolved through discussion
with another investigator (Hongcheng Zhu). For each
study, the following characteristics and information
were collected: first author, year of publication, number
of patients assessed for KRAS gene and number of
patients bearing KRAS mutation gene, gene mutation
detection method, ethnicity, pathology, clinical stage
and data linking KRAS mutation to treatment outcomes
(i.e., CR+PR, SD, PD, and PFS). If a direct report of

8383

HR and 95% CI was not available, the total number of
events, the number of patients at risk in each group and
the log-rank statistic or its P-value was used to allow
for an approximation of the HR estimate. If above
parameters were yet unavailable, estimated value was
derived indirectly from Kaplan-Meier curves using the
methods described by Tierney et al. [66]. Survival rates
on Kaplan-Meier curves were read by Engauge Digitizer
version 4.1 (http://digitizer.sourceforge.net), and then the
data read from the curves were entered in the calculation
spreadsheet appended to Tierney’s paper.

Statistical methods
We extracted relative risks (RRs) with its 95%CIs
to show the strength of the association between KRAS
mutation and objective response rate (CR + PR), and
hazard ratios (HRs) with its 95%CIs to show the survival
(OS, DFS or PFS) benefits of KRAS mutant tumors. The
individual RRs and HRs were combined into pooled
RR and HR, and the initial analyses were performed
with a fixed effect model assuming homogeneity of
the individual studies. Heterogeneity assumption
was checked by Q-test and I2 test. A significant Q-test
(p<0.05) or I2>50% indicate the heterogeneity among
the studies, and the random-effect model was applied for
meta-analysis.
Meta-regression analyses were generated to explore
possible sources of heterogeneity (adjusted R2>50% and
p<0.05 were consider significant).
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify
whether results of the meta-analysis were signify affected
by exclusion of any individual study and to testify the
reliability of the conclusions.
Begg’s and Egger’s tests were used to evaluate
the potential publication bias. The tests were considered
statistically significant if p<0.05, and a non-parametric
“trim-and-fill” method was applied. All p values were
2-sided and all analyses were performed using Stata SE
11.0 software.
