BACKGROUND: This phase 2 trial evaluated the tolerability and clinical efficacy of the combination of oxaliplatin and
pemetrexed as an induction chemotherapy regimen in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC). METHODS: Forty-two patients were enrolled in the study. Patients received pemetrexed 300 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV every 14 days for a total of 4 cycles. A subset of patients consented to correlative studies including tumor tissue for human papillomavirus (HPV) detection and expression of DNA repair
genes that may be predictive of response or resistance to oxaliplatin or pemetrexed. RESULTS: Response data were
available for 40 patients. Eighteen had a partial response, and 1 had a complete response, for a response rate of
47.5%. Patients with HPVþ disease demonstrated superior response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The regimen was well tolerated, with predominantly grade 1 or 2 alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase elevation. One patient had grade 5 toxicity with neutropenia and sepsis. The authors did not identify
genes predictive of response or toxicity, although HPVþ tumors demonstrated a unique gene expression signature.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the response rate of oxaliplatin and pemetrexed proved less than anticipated, the combination remains an active induction regimen in HNSCC. This regimen should be evaluated further in combination with

Induction chemotherapy before definitive radiation therapy for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) continues to be an area of intense investigation. Theoretically, induction therapy may improve outcomes
through enhancement of radiation efficacy, prediction of radiation response, eradication of micrometastatic disease, and early
palliation of symptoms. Furthermore, there is considerable discussion as to whether induction therapy may be able to spare
the use of aggressive concurrent chemotherapy, thus obviating the severe late effects that diminish long-term quality of life.
Growing data support the use of induction therapy in a variety of settings.1-3 However, definitive data from randomized controlled trials are lacking. Furthermore, numerous important clinical questions remain to be answered including the identification of the optimal induction regimen for various cohorts of patients. Encouraging results using the 3-drug combination of
docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil have been reported.2 Thus, this regimen has become a platform for further investigation of the role and impact of induction therapy in the management of head and neck cancer. However, this regimen is associated with significant toxicity. Patients who are elderly or frail or who have multiple comorbidities are often poor candidates
for 5-fluorouracil. Furthermore, for patients with tumors associated with better clinical outcome such as nonsmokers with
human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal carcinomas, aggressive induction therapy may not be necessary. Identification of efficacious, low-toxicity, cost-effective, and easy to administer regimens is therefore warranted.

Original Article

We conducted a phase 2 trial of induction chemotherapy using oxaliplatin and pemetrexed in patients with previously untreated locally advanced HNSCC. The primary
objective was clinical response rate by Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Secondary endpoints
included patient-reported outcomes (quality of life and
symptom burden) and biological correlatives (HPV status,
tumor global gene expression to detect differences in expression patterns between responders and nonresponders).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Recruitment
Between February 2007 and April of 2009, 42 patients
were recruited through the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer
Center Affiliate Network. Patients were required to have
previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage III/IV
(M0) HNSCC. Two cohorts were included: 1) planned
definitive radiation based treatment, or 2) planned surgical
resection  postoperative radiation. Additional eligibility
criteria included: age 18 years; measurable disease
defined by RECIST (version 1.0); Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2;
adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function; and
willingness to take folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone to minimize toxicity. Exclusion criteria included:
grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy; pregnant or lactating; presence of clinically detectable third-space fluid
collections; and history of prior malignancy within the
past 5 years except for curatively treated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or localized prostate cancer. The study was conducted in
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board (IRB) and each of the
IRBs of participating institutions of the Vanderbilt
Ingram Cancer Center Associated Network. All patients
signed informed consent before initiation of therapy.
Treatment
Patients were treated with pemetrexed 300 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) followed by oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV every 14
days for a total of 4 cycles (8 weeks). After 2 cycles, patients
underwent a clinical evaluation of measureable disease to
determine response. Computed tomographic imaging was
the primary modality used, and disease was measured by
RECIST. However, direct laryngoscopy was performed for
response assessment if no clinically measurable disease was
seen on physical exam or on imaging. Partial response by

1008

direct laryngoscopy was defined as >50% reduction in tumor. Patients who had progression of tumor were taken off
of the study. Patients with stable or responding disease continued until completion of the planned therapy. Patients
were withdrawn from the study for unacceptable toxicity,
treatment delay >2 weeks, or withdrawal of consent. After
4 cycles, patients underwent repeat staging with endoscopy
and imaging. To limit treatment-related mucositis and
neutropenia, patients were pretreated with an injection of
vitamin B12 and daily folic acid starting 7 days before
chemotherapy and continuing until 3 weeks after the last
pemetrexed dose. In addition, patients were pretreated with
dexamethasone to prevent pemetrexed-associated rash.
Dose Modifications
Toxicities were grading using National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0.
Hematologic toxicity

If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was
<1000/lL or platelet count was <100,000/lL on day 1
of a cycle, treatment was held until blood counts
returned to above this level. Treatment was then resumed
with a permanent 25% dose reduction. If treatment was
held for >2 weeks because of count suppression, the
patient was withdrawn from the study. If the ANC was
between 1000 and 1500/lL or the platelet count was
between 75,000 and 100,000/lL on day 1 of a cycle, the
patient received a 25% dose reduction for that dose only.
Hepatotoxicity

Treatment was held for bilirubin greater than upper
limits of normal (ULN) until the level was within the normal range. Treatment was then resumed at a 25% dose
reduction. Treatment was held for an alkaline phosphatase
>2.5 ULN. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) >1 to 2.5 ULN required a
25% dose reduction. Patients with an alkaline phosphatase
>1 but <2.5 ULN plus AST or ALT >2.5 to 5
ULN received a 25% dose reduction for subsequent cycles.
Other

For all other clinically significant grade 3 or 4 toxicities, doses were withheld until toxicity resolved to grade
1 and then resumed at a 25% dose reduction. If treatment was held for >2 weeks, the patient was withdrawn
from the study. A second dose reduction was allowed for
patients who experienced significant grade 3 or 4 toxicities

on the reduced dose. Patients who did not tolerate the
dose 2 level were taken off the study.
Correlative Study
Blood for a subset of 24 patients enrolled in the correlative
study was obtained at baseline and day 15, cycle 4. Tumor
tissue was obtained from patients’ original diagnostic biopsy and from the surgical specimen for those patients
undergoing definitive resection. Tumor biopsy for
research purposes was optional and performed at baseline
and on day 15, cycle 4.
The status of human papillomavirus infection was
determined by polymerase chain reaction and by p16 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining as previously
described.4,5 To determine the protein expression levels of
TYMS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif; Cat#35-5800, dilution 1:30), DHFR (Abcam, Cambridge, Mass; ab49881,
dilution 1:30), ERCC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, Calif; FL-297, dilution 1:50), and XPF (Abcam;
ab17798, dilution 1:50), IHC staining was performed for
each protein. Briefly, the tumor sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, then antigen-retrieved using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid followed by incubation with primary
antibodies overnight. After thorough rinsing, the sections
were incubated with secondary antibodies (Mouse Envision; DAKO, Carpentaria, Calif) followed by DAB
chromogen and Mayer hematoxylin. The images were analyzed using the Ariol SL-50 automated slide scanner
(Applied Imaging, San Jose, Calif) to quantify the amount
of nuclear or non-nuclear staining for each slide by processing with the NuclearHighRes or CytoplasmHighRes
scripts without knowledge of clinical data. These scripts
provided the number of positive and negative stained cells
per slide, which allowed calculation of the proportion of
positive cells in each tissue sample. Cells were also classified as positive or negative based on predetermined thresholds that evaluate color and intensity of staining, as well as
cell size, axis length, roundness, and compactness. Thus,
blue hematoxylin staining of nuclei could be distinguished
from brown DAB reaction product. Measured parameters
were the mean intensity and percentage staining area. The
staining index was determined by the mean intensity and
percentage staining area divided by 100.
For gene expression analyses, total RNA was isolated
from either frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue, amplified, labeled, and hybridized onto
Affymetrix 2.0 PLUS GeneChips as previously
described.4 Differentially expressed genes with a false discovery rate <1% were selected from comparison of

tumors from patients with partial response versus stable
disease (SD) using significance analysis of microarrays
and grouped using hierarchical clustering.6,7 Differentially expressed pathways were determined by Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis as previously described.8
Sample and Methods
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical response rate of the combination of pemetrexed and
oxaliplatin in patients with locally advanced HNSCC. The
2 cohorts of pemetrexed and oxaliplatin patients represented similar populations; thus, the response data were
combined. The intent to treat sample was defined as all
subjects who received 1 cycle of oxaliplatin or pemetrexed.
The per protocol sample was defined as all subjects who
received at least 1 cycle of treatment, fulfilled all inclusion
and exclusion criteria, and were evaluable for the primary
efficacy criterion. The study sample evaluable for safety
consisted of all the subjects who received any study medication for whom safety data were available. All safety analyses
were carried out on that sample.
Statistical analysis

Response outcome was determined by RECIST.
Clinical benefit was defined as that portion of patients
experiencing complete response or partial response (PR). A
Simon optimal 2-stage design was used to test the null hypothesis that the true response rate was 50% against the alternative that it was at least 70%.9 Descriptive statistics
were used to summarize the patient characteristics in the
primary and correlative studies. Mann-Whitney (continuous) and likelihood chi-square (nominal) tests were used to
compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of the
HPV status samples in the correlative study. Within the
correlative study, logistic regressions were used to test the
associations of biomarkers with response. Survival analysis
was used to evaluate differences in progression-free and
overall survival curves for the HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups. The Tarone-Ware statistic was used to evaluate differences between the curves, because the test is
designed to have good power across a wide range of survival
functions. Statistical significance was evaluated using a
maximum alpha of .05.

4 or during end of treatment laboratory processes. All liver
enzyme elevations resolved with dose delays or dose reductions per protocol or with completion of protocol treatment. The enzyme elevations were not associated with
symptoms or signs of liver failure, and all patients resolved
to baseline liver enzyme levels without sequelae.

were men, and 17% were women. Other characteristics
at baseline included an ECOG performance status of 0
in 29% of patients and 1 in 67% of patients. Other
prevalent characteristics at baseline included: 71% had
a oropharyngeal primary site, 81% had N2 or N3
disease, and 50% had T3 or T4 primary tumors
(Table 1).
Treatment
The average number of cycles delivered was 3.7 (range, 1-4).
Overall, 85% of patients received all 4 cycles of therapy. Ten
patients required dose reductions, of which 9 were because of
hepatotoxicity and 1 because of febrile neutropenia. Nine
patients required a least 1 dose delay. In 8 patients, the dose
delays were secondary to hepatotoxicity. Six patients went on
to receive all 4 cycles of therapy. Dose delays occurred during
cycles 3 and 4 for 8 of the 9 patients.
Toxicity
All patients were evaluable for toxicity. Overall, the regimen was very well tolerated. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events
are listed in Table 2. One patient experienced febrile neutropenia during cycle 3. The patient underwent subsequent
treatment with a dose reduction without further incident.

Efficacy
Response data were available for 40 of 42 patients. All
responses were determined by imaging using RECIST.
Of 40 evaluable patients, 18 had a PR, and 1 had a
complete response, for an overall response rate of
47.5%. Nineteen patients had SD (47.5%), and 2 had
progressive disease (5%). At a mean follow-up of 16
months (range, 2-36 months), 6 patients had relapsed
or demonstrated progressive disease. Twenty-five
patients (60%) were alive and free of disease at a minimum of 12 months follow-up, whereas 13 patients
(25%) were alive with disease.
Correlative Studies
To identify potential biomarkers of response to oxaliplatin and pemetrexed, gene expression differences in
tumors from responders and nonresponders were
assessed. Ten tumors and 3 adjacent normal epithelia
from 6 patients (4 PR and 2 SD) were available for
gene expression analyses, and a supervised analysis was
performed using PR versus SD as supervising parameters. Up-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism-related
genes such as GSTA1, GSTA4, and ME1 was observed
in tumors with SD (Fig. 1A). These are the key genes
that metabolize xenobiotics and are induced during oxidative stress by Nrf2.10 Up-regulation of this class of
genes has been associated with radiation, platinum,
doxorubicin, and VP16 resistance.10
Additional top ranked differentially expressed genes
were DHFR, TYMS, CDKN2C (p18), and CKDN2A

(p16), which were key genes in the previously determined
HPV signature.4 The tumors with PR contained the HPV
signature when the gene expression profile was specifically
queried for the HPV-associated genes (Fig. 1B). This
prompted us to further examine the HPV status in additional tumors. Twenty-four FFPE tumor samples of the
42 enrolled patients were available for p16 IHC staining
as a surrogate marker of HPV infection. Sixteen of 24
tumors (63%) were p16 positive, and of the cases with disease site information (n ¼ 23), all of the oropharyngeal
primary tumors (100%) but none of the 7 nonoropharyngeal tumors (P < .001) overexpressed p16. Comparisons of p16 status with other clinical information are
detailed in Table 3. The association of p16 status with
response to induction therapy was at the threshold of statistical significance set in this study (partial or complete
response: p16 positive, 9 of 16, 56.3%; p16 negative, 1 or
7, 14.3%; likelihood chi-square(df ¼ 1) ¼ 3.82, P ¼ .051).
Median recurrence-free survival was 19.3 months (95%
confidence interval [CI], 10.1-28.5) for p16-negative
patients and 33.7 months (95% CI, 27.5-37.9) for the
p16-positive group (Tarone-Ware ¼ 4.59, P ¼ .032).
Median overall survival was 20.3 months (95% CI, 12.328.2) for p16-negative patients and 34.1 months (95%
CI, 29.8-38.5) for the p16-positive group (Tarone-Ware
¼ 4.24, P ¼ .039) (Fig. 2).
Finally, we examined genes that were known to be
important in DNA repair and found no statistically significant associations of those repair genes with the treatment

response to pemetrexed and oxaliplatin (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the gene expression data, ERCC1 and XPF protein
expression levels determined by IHC in 21 tumors were
not associated with response or survival (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
The combination of oxaliplatin and pemetrexed is an
active regimen in locally advanced HNSCC; however, the
response rate using RECIST was lower than that reported
by other combination regimens used in the induction setting. It should be noted that concerns were expressed by
Cancer

Oxaliplatin and Pemetrexed in HNSCC/Gilbert et al

clinicians that RECIST was not adequately reflective of
the clinical response. Because unidimensional shrinkage
of a tumor may not be captured as a response measure,
RECIST may underestimate the true response of a treatment regimen. This is especially true in an anatomically
challenging area such as the head and neck, where measuring tumors across scan slices is a recognized challenge.
The combination of pemetrexed and oxaliplatin is
easy to administer and generally well tolerated. Of
note, the incidence of hepatotoxicity was high, with
45% of patients developing grade 1 or 2 toxicity and
21% requiring at least 1 dose reduction. Although the
hepatotoxicity resolved in all patients, our experience
brings into question the feasibility of administering this
regimen over a more protracted treatment course in
other clinical settings, such as patients with metastatic
disease. That being said, the hepatotoxicity was asymptomatic. Patients can complete this induction regimen
without the significant acute toxicities and mortality
rates associated with cisplatin-based combinations.
We could not identify robust biomarkers that predicted response to oxaliplatin and pemetrexed. The failure
to identify predictors of response may be because of the
small sample size or measurement issues related to the use of
RECIST. As expected, overall survival was strongly associated with p16 status reflecting HPV infection. In our study,
94% of oropharyngeal tumors were p16 positive, which is
higher than other published series. In this study, the survival
advantage noted in the patients with HPV-associated disease
may be in part related to the mechanism of action of the
therapeutic agents. HPV deregulates cell cycle and up-regulates dihydrofolate reductase as the result of loss of p53 and
Rb mediated by viral oncogenes E6 and E7.11 Thus, HPVassociated tumors may be more responsive to chemotherapy
drugs that target folate biosynthesis pathway or cell cycle.
Targeting these specific deregulations with less toxic agents
could be a novel approach to decrease treatment-related toxicities in this favorable group of patients.
Furthermore, our initial hypothesis was that the upregulation of DNA repair genes would be associated with
oxaliplatin resistance, but none of the genes reached statistical difference, and differential expression of DNA
repair-related genes may not have a significant role in the
predicted response to oxaliplatin. In addition, up-regulation of genes in xenobiotic metabolism may be a mechanism of oxaliplatin and pemetrexed resistance, as seen
with cisplatin. Although these finding are promising, our
sample size was very limited, and additional studies are
warranted.

Cancer

In summary, the combination of oxaliplatin and
pemetrexed is active and well tolerated in the induction
setting. The question remains whether we can improve on
the clinical activity by the addition of a targeted agent,
such as cetuximab. Moreover, we need to better understand whether induction chemotherapy adds clinical benefit to definitive concurrent chemotherapy. If so, it
remains prudent to define the population in which the
increased toxicities of more aggressive therapy are
warranted.
