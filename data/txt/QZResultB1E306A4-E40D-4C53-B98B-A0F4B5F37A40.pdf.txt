BACKGROUND: Despite clinical trials demonstrating improved survival with adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for patients with American
Joint Committee on Cancer stages I to III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), it is unclear whether this survival benefit extends to
broader populations. The current study evaluated patterns of AC use and examined the impact of AC on survival. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients in the Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry diagnosed with stages IB to IIIA NSCLC
between 2001 and 2008. Descriptive statistics were used to examine patterns of AC use over an 8-year time period. Cox proportional
hazards regression analyses were used to estimate hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to compare mortality
risk among patients treated with and without AC. RESULTS: Among 14,306 patients with stages IB to IIIA NSCLC, 4929 underwent
surgery and 22% of these received AC. The percentages of patients diagnosed in 2001 through 2003, 2004 through 2005, and 2006
through 2008 receiving AC were 7.0%, 29.8%, and 29.5%, respectively. There was no survival benefit with AC noted for patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2003, but AC was associated with improved survival for the period between 2004 and 2005 (HR, 0.78;
95% CI, 0.67-0.91) and 2006 through 2008 (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91). Of those patients receiving AC, 89% received platinumdoublet chemotherapy. Carboplatin remained the most common agent, although cisplatin use reached 43% in the period between
2006 and 2008. The HR for cisplatin relative to carboplatin was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.80-1.15). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant
increase in the use of AC between 2001 and 2008 and AC was associated with an improvement in overall survival. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Despite receiving optimal surgery for localized NSCLC, greater than one-half of patients experience disease recurrence,1,2
and 5-year survival rates without additional treatment range from 67% for patients with stage IA disease to 23% for
patients with stage IIIA disease.3 The goal of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) is to reduce the risk of disease recurrence by eliminating residual disease that may persist after surgical resection, and thus improve survival. A landmark
meta-analysis published in 1995 demonstrated a statistically nonsignificant trend in survival benefit associated with
cisplatin-based AC compared with those patients treated with surgery alone, and an absolute survival benefit of 4% at 5
years.4 Subsequent randomized trials investigating the role of AC in patients with localized NSCLC reported conflicting
results. Although some trials have found no survival difference between patients who underwent surgical resection with
and without AC,5,6 3 large trials demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant survival benefit with cisplatin-based
AC regimens, with 5-year survival differences ranging from 4% to 15%.7-9 Of these, the International Adjuvant Lung
Cancer Trial was to our knowledge the largest and first positive trial demonstrating both an overall and disease-free survival benefit with AC.7 The Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation (LACE) meta-analysis of these 5 large trials using individual patient data reported a significant benefit in overall survival with cisplatin-based AC (hazards ratio [HR], 0.89).10
The Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial, which examined the effect of the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel for
patients with resected stage IB disease, initially reported significantly better survival rates with AC at 4 years of follow-up

in 2004,11 but subsequent analyses performed in 2006
did not reach statistical significance and were only suggestive of improved survival.12 A post hoc subset analysis suggested that tumors measuring > 4 cm had a survival
advantage with this doublet. The LACE meta-analysis
also found a nonsignificant trend toward prolonged survival among patients with stage IB disease treated with
AC, although worse survival was observed for those with
stage IA NSCLC.10 Therefore, survival benefit for
patients with stage IA disease has not been proven and
may be limited to patients with stage IB disease with a
high risk of disease recurrence.
Evidence from randomized trials and meta-analyses
performed within the last decade has had a great impact on
clinical practice for nonmetastatic NSCLC. Currently,
cisplatin-based doublet AC is the standard of care for
patients with completely resected stage II and III disease.1,13,14 However, the AC trials of the last decade
included carefully selected patients with good physiologic
function and the ability to tolerate cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In practice, many patients have significant comorbid disease burden and may have contraindications to
cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Thus, evidence is lacking
regarding the impact of AC on survival in large populationbased cohorts. The current study evaluated the use of and
outcomes associated with adjuvant chemotherapy among
patients after surgical resection for stage IB to IIIA NSCLC.

Exposures and Outcomes

The primary exposure was use of AC, defined as the administration of chemotherapy drugs within 4 months after surgical resection. Pharmacy data from the Decision Support
System databases were used to identify patients receiving
chemotherapy, including the drug name and date of administration. A dichotomized variable was created for AC use.
Clinical and demographic factors assessed included patients’
age at diagnosis, race (white, black, other=unknown), diagnosis period (2001-2003, 2004-2005, and 2006-2008),
American Joint Committee on Cancer stage16 at diagnosis
(stages IB, II, and IIIA), marital status (unmarried, married,
and unknown), and comorbidity. We obtained information
regarding preexisting conditions from inpatient and outpatient administrative data. The Charlson comorbidity index
was used to classify these comorbidities and consists of 19
conditions determined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes.17 We assessed diagnosis
of each condition documented within 18 months before the
lung cancer diagnosis date and further classified patients
based on whether their comorbidity index was 0, 1, or 2, or
 3. Overall survival was the primary outcome. Mortality
was determined by the date of death in the VA Vital Status
File (the accuracy of vital status from this source is considered comparable to the National Death Index).18 Mortality
was assessed from the date of diagnosis through July 1, 2013
(censor date).
Statistical Analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Data Sources

This population-based retrospective study used electronic
data within the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system
and was approved by the Durham VA Institutional
Review Board. The study population consisted of patients
diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) stages IB to IIIA NSCLC between January 1,
2001 and December 31, 2008 who underwent surgical
resection. Data for this study were obtained from the
national VA Central Cancer Registry and the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. The VA Central Cancer Registry
contains all patients diagnosed with and=or treated for
cancer in the VA15 and was used to identify the cohort of
patients diagnosed with stages IB, II, and IIIA NSCLC
between 2001 and 2008 who underwent surgery and provide data regarding patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and primary treatment. Registry data were linked
to several databases in the VA Corporate Data Warehouse
databases to obtain pharmacy, inpatient and outpatient
diagnoses, and vital status data.
1940

Descriptive statistics were used to examine differences in
demographic and clinical characteristics according to the
time period of diagnosis. Overall survival was calculated
as years between the date of diagnosis and either the date
of death or censoring. Cox proportional hazards modeling
was used to estimate the prognostic significance of demographic and clinical characteristics. Multivariate models
were adjusted for age, race, marital status, comorbidity,
AJCC stage of disease, and time period. The 2 treatment
comparisons were AC versus no AC, and carboplatinbased versus cisplatin-based AC for the subset of patients
receiving AC. Overall survival curves were estimated using
the Kaplan-Meier method. All significance tests were 2sided and P values < .05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical
software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

were relatively stable over time, with the most fluctuation
observed for patients with stage II disease (Fig. 1B). Figure

Among 14,306 patients diagnosed with stages IB to
IIIA NSCLC between 2001 and 2008, 5967 underwent
surgical resection. The following sequential exclusions
were applied: unknown surgery date (11 patients), neoadjuvant treatment (264 patients), death  30 days after
surgery (243 patients), and adjuvant radiotherapy (520
patients). These exclusions resulted in a final study population of 4929 surgically resected patients. Most characteristics of the study population were consistent over the
3 time periods (Table 1). The median age was 67 years, a
majority of the patient population (84%) was white, and
20% had no comorbidities. Overall, 22% of patients in
the sample received AC, with a dramatic increase from
7% between 2001 and 2003 to approximately 30% in
subsequent time periods. There was a nearly 7% increase
in the 4-year survival rate of the study population
between 2001 and 2003 (43%) and 2006 and 2008
(50%).

(Table 2). Race was found to have no statistically significant association with survival, married status correlated
with improved survival, and patients with stages II and III
disease were found to have worse survival compared with
patients with stage IB disease. Compared with having no
comorbidities, only the association with  3 comorbidities was found to be statistically significant (HR, 1.29;
95% CI, 1.17-1.42). AC was associated with an 18%
improvement in survival for all years combined (HR,
0.82; 95% CI, 0.74-0.90).
In analyses stratified by time period of diagnosis,
increasing age, AJCC stage, and comorbidity were associated with worse survival in each time period (Table 2).
HRs were significantly greater for patients with advanced
stages of disease compared with those with stage IB disease
and this was the case for each time period. All HR estimates for  3 comorbidities were statistically significant
and varied little over time (HR range, 1.27-1.32). AC was
not associated with survival for the period between 2001
and 2003, but correlated with significant survival benefit
for 2004 through 2005 (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.91)
and 2006 through 2008 (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91).
Race was not associated with survival, and married status
demonstrated improved survival only for 2004 through
2005. In preliminary analyses, only age, AJCC stage, and
marital status were found to be significantly associated
with receipt of AC for all years combined (see online supporting information).
1942

Stage-Specific Patterns of Adjuvant
Chemotherapy and Overall Survival

In all years combined, AC was associated with improved
survival in each stage of disease (Table 3), with the strongest benefit observed for stage II (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.660.89). When stratified by time period, only stage II had a
statistically significant association with survival for 2001
through 2003 and 2004 through 2005. AC demonstrated
reduced mortality risk for diagnoses of stage IB disease
(HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58-0.93) and stage IIIA disease
(HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.98) between 2006 and 2008.
In all stages and time periods combined, the 4-year overall
survival rate among patients treated with AC was 52%
compared with 46% for those treated without AC (data
not shown).
Patients receiving AC were primarily treated with
multiple agents, most commonly platinum-based doublet
AC (89%) (Table 4). Carboplatin remained the most frequently used platinum agent; however, among patients
treated with platinum-based doublet AC, the administration of carboplatin increased from 73% (74 of 101
patients) in 2001 through 2003 to 90% (325 of 362
patients) in 2004 through 2005 and then decreased to
57% (296 of 517 patients) in 2006 through 2008. Cisplatin use decreased from 27% in from 2001 through 2003
to 10% in 2004 through 2005 and increased to 43% in
2006 through 2008. Thus, there was an overall 16%
increase in cisplatin-based doublet AC between 2001 and
2003 and 2006 and 2008. The combination of

carboplatin and paclitaxel was the predominant
carboplatin-based combination used for all time periods.
The combination of cisplatin and etoposide was the most
common cisplatin-based doublet in 2001 through 2003
and 2004 through 2005, but the combination of cisplatin
and vinorelbine was the primary pair in 2006 through
2008. Cisplatin and carboplatin AC had similar survival
outcomes in all patients, and in all time periods, the
adjusted and unadjusted HRs for cisplatin were not statistically significant (Fig. 2).
DISCUSSION
Clinical practice guidelines appear to favor cisplatin-based
AC for patients with stages II and III resected NSCLC

studies are necessary to determine whether outcomes
observed in clinical trials produce similar results in the
general oncology population. We believe the current
study, a large population-based study performed among
veterans, provides a real-world evaluation of AC use
between 2001 and 2008, the era of its adoption in the
United States, and its impact on overall survival. The
results of the current study demonstrated a significant survival benefit associated with receipt of AC. The magnitude of the benefit in the current study (HR, 0.82) is
comparable to that observed in clinical studies (HR,
0.89).10 We further noted that this association varied by
AJCC stage and time period of diagnosis. Carboplatin
was the primary platinum agent used in the adjuvant setting and the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel

was the most common doublet. However, cisplatin-based
chemotherapy was associated with similar overall survival
rate compared with carboplatin-based chemotherapy and
its use increased in the period 2006 through 2008 after
the final results of what to our knowledge is the only clinical trial using carboplatin-based chemotherapy published
to date.
We observed a dramatic increase in receipt of AC
between 2001 and 2003, when there was little evidence
regarding the effect of AC, and 2004 and 2005, when
randomized trials reporting a survival advantage with
chemotherapy began to emerge. To our knowledge to
date, the only published large population-based study of
AC uptake for NSCLC was performed in a population of
surgical patients in Ontario, Canada. The authors noted
an increase in the adoption of AC since 2004 when initial
trials were published.19 They reported AC rates of 7% in
1944

2001 through 2003 and 31% in 2004 through 2006, rates
that are very similar to the rates of AC use in the current
study. These rates may be underestimated due to our use
of registry and administrative data, which do not capture
the reasons patients may not be eligible for AC. Ryoo et al
conducted a study among US veterans diagnosed with
NSCLC in 2007 and found that slightly less than one-half
of eligible patients received adjuvant chemotherapy for
resected stage II=III disease.20 Other studies of AC uptake
after 2004 reported use rates of approximately 40%
among eligible patients at single facilities.21,22
When evaluating the effect of AC on outcome over
time, it is important to evaluate possible changes in diagnosis, staging, and treatment patterns. We considered, but
did not observe, variation in surgical treatment patterns
and evidence of a stage shift between 2001 and 2008 that
would significantly influence survival outcomes. Other

clinical factors such as stage of disease and preexisting conditions are prognostic factors for NSCLC and could affect
the correlation between treatment and survival. Pathologic stage is the main prognostic factor guiding recommendation of AC23 and comorbid conditions can affect
patients’ response to treatment as well as their likelihood
of completing treatment.24 In the current study sample,
increasing stage of disease was positively associated with
receipt of AC, but comorbidity was not. When controlling for these factors, we found a significant survival benefit with AC, particularly among patients diagnosed
between 2004 and 2005 and 2006 and 2008. Based on
the LACE meta-analysis, we would expect an absolute 5year survival benefit of 5%.10 Our finding of a 6% absolute improvement in 4-year survival (52% with AC and
46% without AC) was within the range of that observed
in other studies.8,10,19 Our strongest association with survival was observed for diagnoses of stage II disease made
between 2001 and 2003, which has been the focus of
most trials. It is possible that the significant survival benefit with AC noted among patients with stage IB disease
diagnosed between 2006 and 2008 was influenced by the
overall improvement in survival for patients with stage I
disease relevant to previous time periods. However, the
management of stage IB disease with AC remains controversial. Several trials have failed to demonstrate a significant survival advantage for patients with stage IB disease,
but subsequent analyses have suggested that survival
advantage may be limited to patients with stage IB disease
whose tumors measure > 4cm.8,11
As expected, a majority of patients in the current
study received platinum-based AC. Carboplatin was the
most common platinum agent. Although a great deal of
patient selection is involved when recommending carboplatin versus cisplatin regimens in clinical practice, current guidelines and available evidence from trials most
strongly support cisplatin as the optimal platinum agent
in the adjuvant setting if it can be tolerated.25 In what to
our knowledge is the only adjuvant study to date using
carboplatin was ultimately reported as not demonstrating
a significant survival advantage, but this study was underpowered.11 We observed a similar overall survival with
cisplatin-based AC compared with carboplatin. Gu et al
recently reported the more frequent use of carboplatin as
well as similar survival between carboplatin-based and
cisplatin-based AC among patients in the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database who
were diagnosed with NSCLC between 1992 and 2007.26
Although randomized controlled trial data are a higher
level of evidence for assessing treatment effectiveness,
Cancer

population data have indicated that carboplatin-based AC
is as effective as cisplatin-based AC.
The nonplatinum agent paired with cisplatin or carboplatin may contribute to the survival benefit associated with
AC; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is little definitive evidence regarding which nonplatinum drug is best
to pair with the platinum agent. The predominant regimen
used in clinical trials is cisplatin and vinorelbine, suggesting
that it may be the preferred doublet23; however, this could
also reflect the availability of drugs during the time of the
trials or a bias of those designing and funding the larger adjuvant trials. In the current study, the combination of cisplatin and vinorelbine became the primary cisplatin doublet in
the period between 2006 and 2008. Data regarding the efficacy of carboplatin doublet AC stems from the underpowered Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial, in which the
combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel did not demonstrate a survival benefit for patients with stage IB disease,11
which is contrary to our finding of improved survival with
AC among patients with stage IB disease. Ongoing phase 3
trials27-29 are currently assessing the efficacy of adding bevacizumab to cisplatin-doublet chemotherapy (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E1505; ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier NCT0032480527,28), biomarker-guided selection

resected NSCLC, as did the pivotal trials indicating a survival benefit with AC.
A major advantage to the current study was its large
sample size, including all patients with NSCLC diagnosed
or treated in the VA health care system, from which to
assess use of AC. Another advantage was the ability to
assess temporal changes in AC use, particularly time periods before, during, and after the publication of pivotal
randomized trials of AC for NSCLC. This study improves
on other population-based studies by our ability to assess
the extent to which stage modifies the association between
AC and survival. However, there are limitations that
should be noted. Data sources for the current study did
not include patients’ performance status, which is an important prognostic factor for consideration in recommending AC. Patients most likely to benefit from AC are
those in generally good health and who are relatively
young, without significant comorbidities and no postoperative complications. In an effort to minimize the influence of patients in poor health or those with more severe
disease and therefore a worse prognosis, we excluded those
patients who died within 30 days after surgery and those
who received radiotherapy. We were not able to capture
AC use outside of the VA or examine tumor size within
stage IB for consideration in these analyses. In addition,
given the nature of the VA health care system, issues
regarding access to care are minimized and may have
resulted in higher rates of AC use and completion as well
as follow-up care, limiting the generalizability of the current study results to other populations.
There was a substantial increase in AC use noted
between 2004 and 2005; however, a majority of patients
still do not appear to receive AC and reasons for this nonreceipt of AC need to be explored further. AC use was
associated with significant survival advantage for patients
diagnosed between 2004 and 2005 and 2006 and 2008.
Although associations with improved survival varied by
stage of disease, there was no difference noted with regard
to overall survival when comparing carboplatin-based and
cisplatin-based regimens. If cisplatin tolerance is deemed
to be a limiting factor in receipt of AC, then the finding
that carboplatin-based chemotherapy may offer a similar
benefit is particularly relevant. Together, these findings
indicate that clinical trial results regarding adjuvant chemotherapy benefit are applicable in less selective populations and support the use of AC in routine clinical
practice. This highlights the importance of identifying
patients who are most likely to benefit from adjuvant
chemotherapy and improving AC use rates in an effort to
improve patient outcomes.
