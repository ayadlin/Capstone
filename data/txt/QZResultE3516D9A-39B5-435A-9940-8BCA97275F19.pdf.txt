ABSTRACT
Therapeutic applications of microRNAs (miRNAs) in RAS-driven glioma were
valuable, but their specific roles and functions have yet to be fully elucidated. Here,
we firstly report that miR-143 directly targets the neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene
homolog (N-RAS) and functions as a tumor-suppressor in glioma. Overexpression
of miR-143 decreased the expression of N-RAS, inhibited PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK
signaling, and attenuated the accumulation of p65 in nucleus of glioma cells. In
human clinical specimens, miR-143 was downregulated where an adverse with N-RAS
expression was observed. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-143 decreased glioma
cell migration, invasion, tube formation and slowed tumor growth and angiogenesis
in a manner associated with N-RAS downregulation in vitro and in vivo. Finally, miR143 also sensitizes glioma cells to temozolomide (TMZ),the first-line drug for glioma
treatment. Taken together, for the first time, our results demonstrate that miR143 plays a significant role in inactivating the RAS signaling pathway through the
inhibition of N-RAS, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of
glioma and other RAS-driven cancers.

INTRODUCTION

apoptosis [9]. However, the patients′response rate to TMZbased chemotherapy still remains modest, mainly due to
the development of drug resistance. Thus, it is essential to
developing novel and effective therapeutic strategies for
glioma.
MicroRNAs are small noncoding regulatory RNA
molecules, with profound impact on a wide array of
biological processes [10, 11]. MicroRNAs have been
recently implicated in the regulation of tumorigenesis,
differentiation, proliferation, and survival through the
inhibition of major cellular pathways [12, 13]. Among
them, miR-143 has been demonstrated to function as a
tumor suppressor, and loss of miR-143 expression has
been reported in many cancer types, restoration of miR143 expression has been shown to abrogate tumorigenesis

Glioma, the most common and aggressive form of
primary brain tumor, presents a dismal prognosis. The
poor prognosis and high lethality of the disease is largely
due to the highly invasive/migratory nature of glioma
cells, which are capable of diffusely infiltrating and widely
migrating in the surrounding brain tissue [1-7]. Despite
treating with combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy, glioblastomamultiforme (GBM), the most
malignant and most common glioma, is associated with
an average life expectancy as short as only 15 months [8].
Temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA alkylating antineoplastic
drug, has been used universally in glioma treatment by
inhibiting the proliferation of glioma cells and inducing

[14]. To date, some genes have been identified as miR143 target genes, including K-RAS, ELK1, MYO6, Bcl-2
, ERK5 and IGF-IR ,that are involved in pathogenesis of
cancers [15-21]. However, the molecular mechanism of
miR-143 repression in glioma has not been determined.
RAS sarcoma (Ras) genes are the most frequently
activated oncogenes in human cancer. K-RAS, N-RAS
and H-RAS represent the prototype members of a family
of small G proteins that are frequently activated to an
oncogenic state in a wide variety of human tumors,
including glioma. K-RAS has been reported to be a target
of miR-143 in colorectal cancer cell. N-RAS, as one of the
three members of the RAS oncogene family, encode small
GTPases that are involved in cellular signal transduction.
N-RAS is implicated and functionally altered in a number
of cancers including glioma and has potential roles in
the regulation of cancer cell growth, survival, migration,
invasion, and angiogenesis [22, 23]. Enhanced expression
of N-RAS gene by disorder of transcription may be a
factor in the progression of glioma [24]. Oncogenic
N-RAS promotes tumorigenesis through activation of
multiple downstream pathways, including PI3K/AKT,
MAPK/ERK, and NF-κB pathway [25-28]. Thus, N-RAS
silencing has become an efficient therapeutic strategy in
glioma, but it is still far from optimal and novel therapeutic
strategies are needed urgently.
In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-143
was downregulated in human glioma. Then, we will ask
several important questions in this study: (1) what are the
roles of miR-143 in tumor growth and angiogenesis; (2)
what is the potential direct target of miR-143 that may be
associated with cancer development; and (3) whether miR143 overexpression inhibits AKT, ERK1/2, and NF-κB
signaling pathways via its direct target; (4) What role of
miR-143 and underlying mechanisms in glioma resistance
to TMZ treatment. The answers of these questions would
provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of
glioma development as well as provide new therapeutic

strategy for glioma treatment in the future.

RESULTS
MiR-143 expression was downregulated in glioma
To investigate the role of miR-143 in glioma, we
first evaluated the expression levels of miR-143 in normal
brain tissues and glioma tissues by qRT-PCR (Figure 1A).
The results showed that the expression levels of miR143 were consistently lower in the glioma tissues than
in normal brain tissues. By dividing all glioma samples
into Grade II, Grade III, and Grade IV according to
WHO classification, we found that miR-143 levels were
downregulated in these 3 groups compared to the normal
brain group. But the levels of miR-143 expression among
high grade tumors (WHO Grades III and IV) showed
no significantly difference to those in low grade tumors
(WHO Grade II) (Figure 1B). Our results indicated that the
loss of miR-143 might be an early event in gliomagenesis.

N-RAS is a direct target of miR-143
To fully understand the mechanisms of miR-143 in
glioma, TargetScan search program was used to predict
targets of miR-143, which N-RAS has been thought to
be putative target of miR-143 (Figure 2A). U87 cells
were cotransfected with the wild (WT) or mutated (Mut)
N-RAS luciferase reporter vector together with miR-143
or miR-NC for 24 h, and luciferase activities in those
cells were measured. As shown in Figure 2B, luciferase
activities were significantly reduced in those cells
transfected with the wild sequence and miR-143, but not
in the cells with the mutant sequence and miR-143. Then,
Western blotting analysis was conducted to measure the

levels of N-RAS protein, we found that the expression of
N-RAS protein was downregulated in miR-143 treated
cells, but increased in cells transfected with anti-miR-143
inhibitor (Figure 2C). These results suggest that miR-143
directly targets N-RAS by binding its seed region to their
3’-UTRs in glioma cells.
Furthermore, we measured the levels of N-RAS
protein in glioma specimens and normal brain tissues.
The results showed that the average expression levels of
N-RAS were significantly higher in tumor tissues than
those in the normal brain tissues (Figure 2D). Then, we
determine the correlation between N-RAS levels and
miR-143 expression levels in the same glioma tissues. As
shown in Figure 2E, Spearman’s rank correlation analysis
showed that the expression levels of N-RAS and miR143 in 24 glioma specimens were inversely correlated
(Spearman’s correlation r=-0.4757).

vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been
linked to the AKT and ERK1/2 pathway. Cellular levels
of p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 were significantly decreased in
U87 and U251 cells stably expressing miR-143 compared
with miR-NC, while no statistically significant reduction
of AKT and ERK1/2 was detected (Figure 3A).
Previous studies have shown the importance of HIF1α and VEGF in the regulation of angiogenesis in glioma
[29, 30]. Here, we observed that HIF-1α and VEGF levels
in miR-143-expressing U87 and U251 cells were both
downregulated (Figure 3A and B). It has been reported
that HIF-1α activates the expression of VEGF gene by
binding to the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the
VEGF promoter region. To determine whether miR-143
inhibits VEGF expression through HIF-1α DNA binding
site of VEGF promoter, we analyzed the effects of miR143 on a pMAP11WT VEGF promoter reporter plasmid
containing the HIF-1α binding site, and a pMAP11Mut
plasmid which 3 bp substitution at the HIF-1α binding
site. As shown in Figure 3C, miR-143 inhibited the
pMAP11WT reporter activity in U87 and U251 cells, but
not pMAP11Mut reporter activity, which indicating that
miR-143 inhibits the expression of VEGF through HIF-1α.
To further explore whether the overexpression of N-RAS
influence the expression of p-AKT, p-ERK1/2, HIF-1α
and VEGF, U87 cells were cotransfected with or without

NF-κB reporter decreased in miR-143-overexpression
cells, suggesting that miR-143 contributes to NF-κB
inactivation. MiR-143 overexpression led to reduced
phosphorylation of IKKα and elevated IκBα, but the
expression of p65, a member of NF-κB family did not
changed in U87/miR-143 cells. However, the expression
levels of p65 were higher in cytoplasmic extracts of miR143-overexpressing stable cell lines than in miR-NC cells,
while expression of p65 were lower in nuclear extracts;
more interestingly, overexpression of N-RAS rescued
the accumulation of p65 in nucleus inhibited by miR-143

(Figure 4B). Similarly, we found the expression levels
of p65 in miR-143-overexpressing stable cell lines were
lower than that of miR-NC group associated with N-RAS
group in nucleus by immunofluorescence stain, which
indicated that miR-143 may attenuate the accumulation
of p65 in nucleus in an N-RAS dependent manner (Figure
4C). Taken together, these results further support the
notion that miR-143 functions as a tumor suppressor in
glioma and inhibits NF-κB signaling pathway in vitro by
targeting N-RAS.

MiR-143 inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis
in vivo

Given the important role of N-RAS in regulation of
cell proliferation, migration and invasion [36, 37], miR143-overexpressing U87 cells were used to analyze cell
growth and invasion. The results showed that cell growth
and migration were attenuated in miR-143-overexpressing
U87 cells compared with U87 cells expressing miR-NC
(Figure 5A and B). We showed that forced expression of
N-RAS restored miR-143-inhibited cell proliferation and
migration (Figure 5A and B).
Since invasion and angiogenesis are key
characteristics of malignant tumor, we next investigated
the effects of miR-143 on invasion and angiogenesis in
vitro. Restoration of miR-143 dramatically inhibited the
normally strong invasive capacity of U87 cells (Figure
5C). Simultaneously, tube formation assay showed that
miR-143-transfected group HUVECs presented less tube
length, indicating angiogenesis was suppressed (Figure
5D). As expected, forced expression of N-RAS reversed
miR-143-mediated suppression of cell invasion and
angiogenesis. Thus, our results suggest that overexpression
of miR-143 suppresses glioma cell proliferation,
migration, invasion and angiogenesis by inhibiting its
target N-RAS.

In order to test whether miR-143 attenuates
progression of glioma in vivo, we engineered U87 cells
to stably express miR-NC or miR-143, which were
subsequently implanted into both posterior flanks of
immunodeficient mice, and tumor sizes were measured
after 2 weeks. From the 2nd to 4th week, miR-NC-injected
group developed significantly larger tumors than miR143 group (Figure 7A). MiR-143 stable-expressing cells
generated xenografts that were statistically significantly
smaller than control (Figure 7B). Meanwhile,the final
tumor weight of miR-NC group was much heavier than
miR-143 group (Figure 7C). In agreement with in vitro
studies, the levels of N-RAS from the tumor tissues of
miR-143 expressing group were lower than that of
miR-NC group by immunoblotting assay (Figure 7D).
Moreover, some downstream pathway proteins, such
as p-AKT, p-ERK1/2 and HIF-1α were significantly
suppressed by miR-143 in glioma tissues (Figure 7D).
Consistent with our previous studies, we showed that miR143 inhibited tumor growth via anti-angiogenesis function.
IHC staining revealed that the expression levels of VEGF
and CD31 were significantly repressed by miR-143
inglioma tissues (Figure 7E). It was also confirmed that
VEGF expression in xenograft tumors were significantly
decreased by miR-143. Furthermore, quantitative
microvascular density (MVD) analysis showed significant
suppression in miR-143 overexpression group, inferring
that miR-143 represses angiogenesis in xenografts. Taken
together, these results suggest that miR-143 inhibits tumor
growth and angiogenesis in vivo through targeting N-RAS
and other downstream signaling molecules.

Overexpression
of
miR-143
increases
chemosensitivity of glioma cells to TMZ by
inhibiting its target N-RAS
Resistance to TMZ treatment is one of the major
causes for the failure of chemotherapy in treating
glioma. Therefore, it is critical to discover new strategies
to increase the effectiveness of TMZ for therapeutic
purposes. Our results showed that overexpression of miR143 in U87 cells significantly increased chemosensitivity
to treatment of TMZ (Figure 6A). Furthermore, cell
growth rate in the presence of TMZ (100μM) was assayed
by CCK-8 proliferation assay at different time points, then
forced expression of N-RAS reversed miR-143-induced
glioma chemosentivity to TMZ (Figure 6B). To further
study whether miR-143 and its target N-RAS play a role
in cell apoptosis in the presence of TMZ treatment, FACS
analysis was performed to detect cell apoptosis rates. The
combination of miR-143 and TMZ treatment significantly
induced cell apoptosis, whereas forced expression of
N-RAS partially abolished the effect induced by miR-143
plus TMZ treatment (Figure 6C). Similarly, we also found
that the expression of N-RAS in U87/143 cells treated
with TMZ is lower that the non-treated by immunobloting
(Figure 6D). These results indicated that miR-143 renders
glioma cells more sensitive to TMZ treatment, miR-143
and TMZ combination induced apoptotic effect through

DISCUSSION
MicroRNAs (miRNA), a novel class of regulatory
molecules, have been frequently indicated to be
dysregulated in diverse human cancers [38]. MiRNAs
have been documented to function both as tumor
suppressor genes and oncogenes, regulating many cellular
events. Recent studies have been reported that miR-143
plays a potential role as a tumor suppressor in many kinds
of cancers [12, 13, 36]. However, there are no results
referring to the role of miR-143 in glioma at present. In
this study, we found that the expression of miR-143 is
downregulated in glioma samples compared with normal
brain tissues. Moreover, overexpression of miR-143
significantly inhibited glioma cell migration, invasion, and
tumor growth.
RAS family play a pivotal role in the transduction
of several growth or differentiation factor stimuli [39]. It

has been reported that the expression levels of K-RAS
and N-RAS are related to the malignant degree of cancers,
including glioma, breast cancer, melanoma, and other
cancers [40-43]. Recently, accumulating evidence has
indicated that expression levels of the RAS family can
be regulated by miRNAs. For example, overexpression
of miR-145 can inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth
by targeting N-RAS and VEGF. It has been revealed
that K-RAS gene is a target of miR-143 in colorectal
cancer [17]. In our study, N-RAS oncogene has been
experimentally validated as the novel target of miR143 not only in vitro, but also in vivo. Firstly, luciferase
reporter assay confirmed that miR-143 directly recognize
the 3′-UTR of N-RAS transcripts. Secondly, N-RAS
expression was significantly abolished in glioma cells
which miR-143 stablely-expressed andincreased in
glioma cells which miR-143 inhibited. Thirdly, an
inverse correlation between N-RAS protein and miR143 in clinical samples was found. Finally, inhibition
of N-RAS expression by miR-143 inhibits constitutive
phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2. Taken together,
the present study provides the first evidence that miR-143
is significant in suppressing glioma cell growth through
inhibition of N-RAS translation.
Angiogenesis is a key process in gliomagenesis.
AKT and ERK1/2 are upstream regulators of HIF-1α
and VEGF, which are the important components for
angiogenesis [44, 45]. Consistent with our previous
study, phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) and ERK1/2
(p-ERK1/2) was significantly inhibited by treatment with
miR-143, therefore inhibited the expression of HIF-1α and
VEGF; nevertheless, overexpression of N-RAS restored
miR-143-inhibited cellular levels of p-AKT,p-ERK1/2,
HIF-1α and VEGF. Here, we found that miR-143 functions
as an anti-angiogenic regulator in gliomatumorigenesis.
Overexpression of miR-143 in glioma cells led to reduced
tube formation, number of microvessels in vivo, and then
impaired tumor growth in tumor xenograft. Interestingly,
we also found the interaction between NF-κB signaling
pathway and miR-143 in indicated cells by reporter gene
assay, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence stain
in our study. These results indicate that miR-143 may
attenuate the accumulation of p65 in nuclear by targeting
N-RAS. Apparently, the precise mechanisms by which
miR-143 inactivates NF-κB pathway in glioma need to be
further investigated. Taken together, our study highlighted
the key role of miR-143 in growth of glioma and suggested
that miR-143 could be an ideal target for glioma therapy.
Despite having a better understanding of the
molecular events that govern the glioma than ever before,
it remains a clinical challenge in the treatment of glioma.
Identification of new biomarkers that play a central role
in the progression of glioma will benefit diagnosis and
targeting therapy of the disease. MiRNAs are differentially
expressed in chemosensitive and chemoresistant cells [46,
47]. Several studies have suggested that miRNAs are
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

novel players in the development of chemoresistance.
Recent study showed that ectopic miR-34a sensitized
the colorectal cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil [48]. MiR211 in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) and
temozolomide significantly induces glioma cells apoptosis
and DNA fragmentation [49]. In this study, we found that
forced overexpression of miR-143 promoted the effects
of TMZ. Flow Cytometer Assay demonstrated that U87
cells with miR-143 stable expression have TMZ higher
sensitiveness to apoptosis. Thus, it is important that a
miR-143 restoration approach may offer a new modulation
strategy to overcome chemoresistance to TMZ treatment
in giloma.
In summary, we have identified a link between
miR-143 and N-RAS that is a novel constituent of
glioma tumorigenesis. Over the past few years, it has
been shown that miR-145 and miR-124 target N-RAS
in different tumors such as breast cancer, colon cancers
and glioblastoma stem cells. We speculate that these
tissue-specific miRNAs may contribute to the cognate
abnormality via similar pathways. Now despite having
a better understanding of the molecular events that
govern the glioma than ever before, it remains a clinical
challenge in the treatment of glioma. Identification of new
biomarkers that play a central role in the progression of
glioma will benefit diagnosis and targeting therapy of the
disease.

were from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA, USA).

System (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) was used
for signal detection.

Lentivirus packaging and stable cell lines

The 3′-UTR of N-RAS were synthesized and
annealed, then inserted into the SacI and HindIII sites of
pMIR-reporter luciferase vector (Ambion) at downstream
of the stop codon of the gene for luciferase. For its
mutagenesis, the sequences complementary to the binding
site of miR-143 in the 3′-UTR (N-RAS:TTCATCTC) was
replaced by TACTTGAC. These constructs were validated
by sequencing. U87 cells were seeded into a 24-well plate
for luciferase assay. After cultured overnight, cells were
cotransfected with the wild-type or mutated plasmid, pRLTK plasmid, and equal amounts of miR-143 or miR-NC.
Luciferase assays were performed 24h after transfection
using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega, WI, USA). The primers are as follows: N-RAS
forward primer:5′-GCGAGCTCGCTTCTTGTAATTCAT
CTCTGCTAA-3′, reverse primer:5′-GCAAGCTTTTATG
ACTAAGCCAAGAACTTCCAG-3′.
To determine the effects of miR-143 on
transcriptional activation of VEGF, VEGF reporter
plasmid pMAP11-WT or pMAP11-mut [52]was
cotransfected into U87 cells with pRL-TK plasmid and
equal amounts of miR-143 or miR-NC. Firefly and Renilla
luciferase activities were measured 24h later. Experiments
were performed in three independent replicates.

Luciferase reporter assay

The lentiviral packaging kit was purchased from
Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL, USA). Lentivirus
carrying hsa-miR-143 or hsa-miR-negative control
(miR-NC) was packaged following the manufacturer’s
manual. Lentivirus were packaged in HEK-293T cells
and collected from the medium supernatant. Stable cell
lines were established by infecting lentivirus into U87 and
U251 cells and selected by puromycin.

RNA extraction, reverse transcription PCR and
quantitative real time-PCR
RNA was isolated from harvested cells or human
tissues with Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer′s
instruction (Invitrogen, CA, USA). To measure expression
levels of miR-143, stem-loop specific primer method was
used as described before [50, 51]. Expression of U6 was
used as an endogenous control. To determine the mRNA
levels of VEGF, total RNAs were reversely transcribed by
oligodT primer using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara,
Dalian, China). Housekeeping gene GAPDH was used as
internal control,primers were used as described before
[15]. The cDNAs were amplified by qRT-PCR using
SYBR Premix DimerEraser (Takara, Dalian, China) on
a 7900HT system, and fold changes were calculated by
relative quantification (2-△ △ Ct).

Cell proliferation
To determine the effects of miR-143 on growth
of glioma cells, cells were seeded in 96-well plates
at confluence of 2000 cells per well. The absorptions
of the cells were measured using a CCK8 kit (Dojindo
Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the
manufacturer′s instruction at different indicated time
points. Data were from three separate experiments with
four replications each time.

Immunoblotting
Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS buffer, scraped
from the dishes, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm, 4°C for
15 min. Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer
supplemented with protease inhibitors (100 mM Tris, pH
7.4, 150 mMNaCl, 5mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1%
deoxycholate acid, 0.1% SDS, 2mMphenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 2mM DTT,
2mMleupeptin, 2mMpepstatin). The supernatants were
collected and protein concentration was determined using
BCA assay (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu,
China). Tumor tissues from human and nude mice were
grinded into powder in liquid nitrogen with RIPA buffer,
and the total tissue proteins were extracted as described
above. Aliquots of protein lysates were fractionated by
SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane (Roche,
Switzerland), and subjected to immunoblotting analysis
according to the manufacturer′s instruction. ECL Detection

Wound healing assay
Cells were cultured until reached 90% confluence
in 6-well plates. Cell layers were scratched using a 20μ
L tip to form wounded gaps, washed with PBS twice
and cultured. The wounded gaps were photographed
at different time points and analyzed by measuring the
distance of migrating cells from five different areas for
each wound.

Cell invasion assay

by flow cytometry (FACS Canto II, BD Biosciences)
within 1 h. The data were analyzed using FlowJo software.
Three experiments were performed in triplicate.

Invasion assay was determined using 24-well BD
Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences, Cowley,
UK) in accordance with the manufacturer′s instructions.
5×104 cells were seeded per well in the upper well of the
invasion chamber in DMEM without serum, the lower
chamber well contained DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS to stimulate cell invasion. After incubation for 24 h,
noninvading cells were removed from the top well with
a cotton swab while the bottom cells were fixed with
3% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet,
and photographed in three independent fields for each
well. They were finally extracted with 33% acetic acid
and detected quantitatively using a standard microplate
reader (at 570 nm). Three independent experiments were
conducted in triplicate.

Tumorigenesis in nude mice
Male BALB/c nude mice (6-weeks-old) were
purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center
(Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China) and
maintained in special pathogen-free (SPF) condition for
one week. Animal handling and experimental procedures
were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals, and approved by the Animal
Experimental Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical
University. U87 cells stably expressing miR-143 or miRNC were injected subcutaneously into both flanks of nude
mice (5×106 cells in 100 µl). Tumor sizes were measured
using vernier caliper every two days when the tumors
were apparently seen and tumor volume was calculated
according to the formula: volume = 0.5×Length×Width2.
24 days after implantation, mice were sacrificed and
tumors were dissected. Total proteins and RNAs were
extracted for immunoblotting and qRT-PCR. Tumors were
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned at 5µm
for VEGF (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and CD31 (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) immunohistochemical staining under the
standard procedure as described before [54].

Tube formation assay
To pretreat the 96-well plate, 50 μL of growth
factor-reduced Matrigel thawed on ice was added to each
well. The plate was then placed in an incubator to allow
the gel to solidify at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were cultured to
90–100% concentration, the old medium was discarded
and provided with serum-reduced medium (1% FBS)
for 24h. The medium was collected and stored at -80°C.
HUVEC cells at subconcentration were switched to EBM2 basic medium containing 0.2% FBS. In 24 h, the starved
HUVEC cells were trypsinized, collected, counted, and
resuspended in EBM-2 basic medium. Then cells were
mixed with equal volume of the conditioned medium and
seeded to Matrigel-pretreated 96-well plate at 104cells/
well. In 12h, tube formation was examined under light
microscope. The length of the tubes was measured using
the Soft Imaging System (Soft Imaging System GmbH,
Germany).

Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed three times and
data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5 (La Jolla,
CA, USA). The correlation between miR-143 expression
and N-RAS levels in glioma tissues were analyzed using
Spearman′s rank test. Statistical evaluation for data
analysis was determined by t-test. The differences were
considered to be statistically significant at P< 0.05.
