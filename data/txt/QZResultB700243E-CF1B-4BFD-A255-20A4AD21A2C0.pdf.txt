Abstract
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy,
often diagnosed at advanced stage leading to poor prognosis.
In the study reported here, magnetic resonance imaging and
near-infrared reflectance imaging were applied for in vivo
analysis of two competing endocytic pathways affecting
retention of bifunctional daidzein-bovine serum albumin
(BSA)–based contrast media by human epithelial ovarian
carcinoma cells. Suppression of caveolae-mediated uptake
using nystatin or by BSA competition significantly enhanced
daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA/CyTE777 uptake by tumor cells
in vitro. In vivo, perivascular myofibroblasts generated an
effective perivascular barrier excluding delivery of BSAGdDTPA/CyTE777 to tumor cells. The ability to manipulate
caveolae-mediated sequestration of albumin by perivascular
tumor myofibroblasts allowed us to effectively overcome this
tumor-stroma barrier, increasing delivery of daidzein-BSAGdDTPA/CyTE777 to the tumor cells in tumor xenografts.
Thus, both in vitro and in vivo, endocytosis of daidzein-BSAGdDTPA/CyTE777 by ovarian carcinoma cells was augmented
by albumin or by nystatin. In view of the cardinal role of
albumin in affecting the availability and pharmacokinetics
of drugs, this approach could potentially also facilitate the
delivery of therapeutics and contrast media to tumor cells.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy,
placing it among the five most common causes of cancer-induced
deaths in women. Ovarian cancer is often detected at advanced
stage, and despite frequent effective response to initial chemotherapy, clinical prognosis is poor (1). We have previously reported
the contribution of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating
hormone in induction of angiogenesis and adhesion of ovarian
carcinoma tumors (2). Furthermore, using magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), we showed that angiogenesis and progression in
ovarian carcinoma is tightly linked spatially and temporally with
desmoplastic reaction associated with fibroblasts and myofibroblasts recruited to the tumors (3–5).
BSA-GdDTPA/FAM was previously applied for MRI and fluorescence imaging of vascular permeability associated with angiogen-

esis in tumors (6), grafts(7), and pregnancy(8). Additionally, we
recently reported the use of biotin-BSA-GdDTPA for tracking tumor
stroma fibroblasts by MRI (9, 10). Due to the central role of albumin
in affecting the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutics and
contrast media, we evaluated the fate of biotin-BSA-GdDTPA
extravasated from leaky blood vessels in ovarian carcinoma tumor
xenografts. Histologic staining of the biotinylated albumin-based
contrast material showed lymphatic clearance, along with residual
prolonged retention within the myofibroblast stroma tracks, where
it was internalized by a smooth muscle actin expressing myofibroblasts. Subsequent in vitro studies showed that biotin-BSA-GdDTPA
was effectively internalized by fibroblasts using caveolae-mediated
uptake, which could be suppressed by treatment with nystatin (9,
11). Upon internalization, the material is sequestered within small
intracellular vacuoles leading to suppressed MRI relaxivity, which is
regained only after the material is redistributed in the cells with cell
division (9, 12). The contrast material did not extravasate into the
interstitial space within the tumor nodules (9). The exclusion of the
contrast media from the tumor nodules suggested that interaction
of therapeutics or contrast media with albumin could significantly
hinder their delivery to the tumor cells.
In the study reported here, we aimed to alter the distribution of
biotin-BSA-GdDTPA, and to enhance the partition of the contrast
material to the tumor by addition of daidzein as a targeting ligand,
recently reported to show high affinity to the ovarian carcinoma cells
(13). A carboxyalkyl derivative of the isoflavone daidzein was used
because isoflavones interact weakly with the estrogen receptors (ER)
and have additional cellular activities not ascribed to activation of
the ERs, such as regulation of cell-signaling pathways, and can
inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in ER-negative breast
cancer cell lines (e.g., MDA-MB-231), as well as in ER-positive lines
(e.g., MCF-7; ref. 14). It was recently reported that the N-t-Bochexylenediamine derivative of 7-(O)-carboxymethyl daidzein exhibits
more potent inhibitory activity on the growth of estrogen-sensitive
(e.g., ovarian, colon) cancer cell lines than the parent isoflavones
while retaining no estrogenic activity. As recently reported, the
antiproliferative effects of this compound was also effective in vivo in
reducing growth of human ovarian xenografts in nude mice (15).
Daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA/CyTE777 conjugate was generated and
applied here for MRI/near-infrared (NIR) detection of ovarian
carcinoma tumors in vivo, whereas daidzein-BSA-FAM and BSAROX were used for in vitro analysis of endocytosis of the contrast
media by fluorescence microscopy and by flow cytometry. This work
adds daidzein to a rapidly growing list of ligands that are being
developed for targeted imaging of tumors by MRI, including
targeting glutamine transporters(16), folate receptors (17), and
Her-2/neu receptors (18).
We report here that the use of daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA/CyTE777
(or FAM) as a bifunctional-targeted contrast media revealed a novel

mechanism regulating endocytosis by ovarian cancer cells, involving competition between receptor-mediated internalization
through binding of daidzein and caveolae-mediated internalization
via binding of albumin. Thus, internalization of daidzein-BSAGdDTPA/CyTE777 (or FAM) could be induced by competition with
BSA CyTE777 (or ROX), or alternatively by inhibition of caveolae
uptake using nystatin. Histologic analysis of tumors revealed
significant uptake of the bifunctional contrast media to the tumor
cells, overcoming the limited distribution observed for biotin-BSAGdDTPA, which is restricted to the perivascular stroma cells. These
results provide a mechanism for altering the microdistribution and
partition of the contrast media within the tumor, achieving effective
targeting of the tumor cells, and providing possibilities for
modulating the delivery through exogenous competition with
caveolae mediated binding of albumin.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Bovine serum albumin (BSA), nystatin, polylysine, DTPA anhydride,
GdCl3, and 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from

www.aacrjournals.org

Daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA. BSA-DTPA was synthesized as described (19).
Briefly, 1.6 grams of DTPA anhydride (suspended in 4 mL of dry DMF) were
slowly added with stirring to 1.3 grams of BSA [in 40 mL Hepes 0.1M (pH
8.8)] while the reaction was titrated with NaOH 5N and stirred for 2 h. The
product was dialyzed against NaHCO3. Afterwards, the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of 7-(O)-carboxymethyl (daidzein-NHS), synthesized according
to reference (15), (11 mg in 800 AL of anhydrous DMF) was added to BSADTPA [in 40 mL of NaHCO3, 0.1M (pH 8.5)] and stirred overnight. The
product was dialyzed (19) first against NaHCO3, followed by sodium citrate
[0.1 M (pH 6.5)]. GdCl3 [650 mg; in 5 mL sodium acetate 0.1M (pH 6.0)] was
added to daidzein-BSA-DTPA in sodium citrate [0.1 M (pH 6.5)]. The final
product (daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA) was dialyzed extensively against water
and lyophilized.
BSA-CyTE777/FAM/ROX. CyTE777-NHS (44 mg) prepared according to
(20) or FAM-NHS (35 mg) or ROX-NHS (35 mg; in 200 AL dry DMF) were
added to BSA [450 mg; in 15 mL NaHCO3, 0.1M (pH 8.5)], slowly with
stirring. The reaction was stirred overnight, and the product was dialyzed
against NaHCO3, 0.1M (pH 8.5), followed by several changes of water and
lyophilized.
Daidzein-BSA-CyTE777/FAM. Daidzein-NHS (8 mg; in 600 AL dry DMF)
was added to BSA-CyTE777/FAM [100 mg; in 6 mL of NaHCO3, 0.1M (pH
8.5)], and the reaction was stirred overnight. The product was purified by
dialysis against NaHCO3, 0.1M (pH 8.5), followed by several changes of water
and lyophilized. This product was used for the in vivo studies.
Fluorescence microscopy. MLS cells (2*105) were cultured on
polylysine coated coverslips for 48 h. Subsequently, the coverslips were
incubated for 1 h at 370 with daidzein-BSA-FAM (200 Ag/mL) or BSA-FAM
(200 Ag/mL) or combination of both (daidzein-BSA-FAM with BSA-ROX) in
the presence or absence of a blocking dose of nystatin (50 Ag/mL). The
excess of fluorescent material was washed thrice with PBS, and the cells
were fixed with 4% PFA, then washed, and stained with DAPI and mounted.
The images were monitored by two-photon microscopy (2PM; Zeiss LSM
510 META NLO; equipped with a broadband Mai Tai-HP-femtosecond single
box tunable Ti-sapphire oscillator, with automated broadband wavelength
tuning 700–1,020 nm from Spectraphysics, for two-photon excitation).
Histologic sections of isolated tumors, from mice injected with daidzeinBSA-FAM or BSA-FAM or combination of daidzein-BSA-FAM and BSA-ROX,
were deparafinized, stained with DAPI, and mounted. The fluorescence
signal was monitored by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 710).
Flow cytometry. MLS cells (106) were incubated for 30 min with
daidzein-BSA-FAM (200 Ag/mL) or BSA-ROX (200 Ag/mL) or a combination of both in the presence or absence of a blocking dose of nystatin
(50 Ag/mL). The excess of fluorescent material was washed thrice with
PBS containing 0.01% of sodium azide. The cellular uptake of fluorescent
material was monitored by FACScan. The excitation produced by aircooled argon laser 288 nm and the emission signal was collected by FL1
filter (BP530/30) for FAM and FL2 filter (BP585/42) for ROX.
Animal experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Weizmann Institute. CD-1 nude mice
were inoculated s.c. with 2.5  106 MLS tumor cells. Tumors were allowed to
grow until 5 to 7 mm in diameter (approximately 14–21 d).
In vivo NIR imaging. Tumor-bearing mice were injected with daidzeinBSA-CyTE777 [i.v.; 1 mg ( for IVIS 100) or 0.5 mg ( for IVIS Spectrum) in
0.1 mL PBS/mouse; n = 5 and n = 2, respectively], or with BSA-CyTE777
(1 or 0.5 mg in 0.1 mL PBS/mouse; n = 2 and n = 2) as control, or with
daidzein-BSA-CyTE777 + BSA-FAM [1 mg ( for IVIS 100) or 0.5 mg ( for IVIS
Spectrum) of each dye in 0.1 mL PBS/mouse; n = 2 and n = 2, respectively;
for the BSA overload experiment]. The NIR signal in the whole animal was
monitored by IVIS 100 and IVIS Spectrum (Xenogen, Caliper) at 24, 48, and

72 h. The mice were fed with alfalfa-free (chlorophyll-free) diet 72 h
previsualization. In the IVIS, 100 the data were acquired by 710 to 760
excitation, 675 to 720 excitation background, and 810 to 860 emission filters.
In the IVIS Spectrum, the data obtained for the daidzein-BSA-CyTE777 was
acquired by 745 nm excitation and 820 nm emission filters.
The pharmacokinetics of the fluorescent and MRI BSA–based contrast
media and their plasma concentration after i.v. administration were
previously reported to be similar for all tags (19).
MRI measurements. MRI experiments were performed on a horizontal
4.7 T Biospec spectrometer using an actively radiofrequency decoupled 1.5cm surface coil embedded in a Perspex board and a birdcage transmission
coil. In vitro, R 1 measurements spin echo images were acquired at 8 different
repetition times ranging between 2,000 and 100 ms (2 averages; field of view,
4  4 cm; slice thickness, 1 mm; matrix 128  128). R 1 relaxation rates for
the in vitro experiments were derived by nonlinear single exponential fitting
of images acquired at different repetition times (equation [1]):
I ¼ M0 ð1  eTRR1 Þ

Where I is the measured signal intensity for each TR , and R 1 was derived
from optimization of the curve fitting; M 0 is the steady-state signal intensity
in fully relaxed images.
In vivo. The tumor-bearing mice were injected i.v. with BSA-GdDTPA (12
mg in 200 AL PBS/mouse) or daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA (12 mg in 200 AL PBS/
mouse) or with combination of daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA and BSA-FAM
(competition experiment). R 1 was measured 24, 48, and 72h after injection
of the contrast material. T 1-weighted three-dimensional gradient-echo
images, with pulse flip angles of 5j, 15j, 30j, 50j, and 70j were acquired to
determine the R 1 values. The acquisition parameters were as follows: TR, 10
ms; TE, 3.561 ms; 2 averages; field of view, 4  4  4; 128  128  128 pixels.
Three-dimensional gradient-echo data sets were used for generation of R 1
maps as well as for calculation of the average R 1 values in selected regions
of interest by nonlinear best fit to equation [1]:

(Fig. 1). Thus, albumin binding mediated by caveolae seemed
to interfere with internalization of daidzein-BSA-FAM into the
cells, despite the role of caveolae uptake of BSA-FAM. To test
this hypothesis, we evaluated the ability of BSA to compete with
daidzein-BSA-FAM on the albumin binding site in caveolae, thereby
facilitating internalization of the material to cells (Fig. 2). Here
again, internalization of daidzein-BSA-FAM was augmented by
addition of nystatin.
Albumin and daidzein-mediated endocytosis and labeling
of ovarian carcinoma cells: flow cytometry. The binding and
uptake of BSA-ROX and daidzein-BSA-FAM by MLS ovarian
carcinoma cells was quantified by flow cytometry (Fig. 3). MLS
cells were incubated with either BSA-ROX, daidzein-BSA-FAM, or
with both BSA-ROX and daidzein-BSA-FAM in the presence or
absence of nystatin. Treatment with nystatin resulted in a
significant 4-fold enhancement in the fluorescence intensity of
cells incubated with daidzein-BSA-FAM (Fig. 3A and B). On the
other hand, binding and uptake of BSA-ROX were only slightly
reduced by nystatin. These results are consistent with a shift from

Results
Presence of caveolin 1 in MLS ovarian cancer cells. When
MLS ovarian cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with
an anti caevolin-1, a protein band of 21 kd was visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). MCF7-CV1 cells used
a positive control showed a protein band with the same MW
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Albumin and daidzein-mediated labeling of ovarian carcinoma cells: fluorescence microscopy. Endocytic pathways in
ovarian cancer cells were evaluated in vitro using two fluorescent
probes, monofunctional BSA-FAM, targeting cellular caveolae (9),
and bifunctional daidzein-BSA-FAM targeting both caveolae and
cell surface receptors with affinity to daidzein. Binding and
uptake of BSA-FAM and daidzein-BSA-FAM by MLS human
epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells could be detected by fluorescence microscopy, showing internalization of the fluorescent
probes into intracellular vesicles (Fig. 1A). Suppression of
caveolae-mediated uptake by treatment of the cells with nystatin
(50 Ag/mL; 30 min), resulted, as expected, in an elevated
membrane staining and reduced uptake of BSA-FAM (Figs. 1
and 2). Surprisingly, nystatin treatment resulted in significantly
enhanced internalization of daidzein-BSA-FAM by MLS cells

endocytosis to membrane binding of daidzein-BSA-FAM in the
presence of nystatin as detected by fluorescence microscopy
(Fig. 1). Incubation of the cells with both BSA-ROX and daidzeinBSA-FAM resulted in a differential response to nystatin, with
increased labeling of cells with daidzein-BSA-FAM (3-fold induction in the intensity and increase of 20% in the population of
labeled cells), and decreased fluorescence of BSA-ROX (1.3-fold
decrease in intensity and 51% decrease in labeled population; Fig.
3B–D). These results are also consistent with the endocytic
pathways detected by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1).
In vivo fluorescence imaging of targeted delivery of
daidzein-BSA-CyTE777 to ovarian carcinoma. Systemic delivery
of daidzein-BSA-CyTE777 resulted is tumor selective enhancement
of NIR fluorescence for subcutaneous ovarian carcinoma tumor
xenografts (Fig. 4). Mice were inoculated s.c. with 2.5  106 MLS
tumor cells. Ten days after tumor inoculation, mice were given
daidzein-BSA-CyTE777 or BSA-CyTE777. Already in the first 30 min
after administration, mice injected with daidzein-BSA-CyTE777
showed more specific localization in the tumor and in higher
concentration than mice given with BSA-CyTE777 (Supplementary

Fig. S3). Competition of daidzein-BSA-CyTE777 with BSA-ROX
overload increased the NIR signal of daidzein-BSA-CyTE777 in the
tumor. However, the contrast material distribution was less specific
to the tumor itself relative to the injection of daidzein-BSACyTE777 alone, suggesting that the endogenous level of albumin
may be better optimized for targeted imaging, and BSA overload
could reduce specificity by interference with clearance pathways.
Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed different pharmacokinetic behavior in the elimination of the contrast materials from
the tumor. Control mice injected with BSA-CyTE777 showed first
order clearance of the contrast media. Daidzein-BSA-CyTE777 was
eliminated with rapid initial kinetics, faster than the elimination
rate of BSA-CyTE777. However, this was followed by residual
retention of daidzein-BSA-CyTE777 with very slow clearance. Thus,
after the initial elimination, mice that were given daidzein-BSACyTE777 showed a specific NIR signal in the tumor area that
retains for 48 hours after the administration (n = 7), and it was
statistically significant comparing to the signal of the BSA-CyTE777
injected mice (n = 4; P = 0.047; Fig. 4B). The NIR signal in the
tumors was detectable even 10 days after the administration.

Biodistribution of Daidzein-BSA-EuDTTA (chelate). The
lanthanide chelate of europium (Eu3+; analogue to GdDTPA) has
unique fluorescence properties allowing its use for labeling
antibodies in immunoassays. MLS tumor–bearing mice were
injected with BSA-Eu chelate (n = 3) or daidzein-BSA-Eu chelate
(n = 5). After 24 or 48 hours, the mice were sacrificed and the
tumors were isolated. The fluorescence due to Eu in the various
extracts of tissues was determined. A large 2- to 3-fold increase in
Eu was detected in tumors of the mice injected with daidzein-BSAEu chelate compared with those injected with BSA-Eu chelate at 24
and 48 hours after injection (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Distribution of daidzein-BSA-FAM in ovarian tumors. The
distribution of contrast material inside the tumors was visualized
by fluorescence microscopy, in tumors isolated 24 hours after
injection with daidzein-BSA-FAM or BSA-FAM. Daidzein-BSA-FAM
was localized in the tumor cells areas, whereas BSA-FAM was
localized to the tumor blood vessels and their surrounding stroma
cells (Fig. 5A–B).
Additionally, we observe different distribution pattern of
daidzein-BSA-FAM or BSA-ROX in the tumor isolated 24 hours
after their combined injection. Consistent with our previous
results, daidzein-BSA-FAM was distributed in all the tumor area
with enhanced staining around the vessel, whereas BSA-ROX was
localized in the stromal fibroblast area. (Fig. 5C).
In vivo MRI detection of targeted delivery of Daidzein-BSAGdDTPA to ovarian carcinoma. Daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA showed
significant relaxivity of 194 mM1s1 (per BSA; Fig. 6A). This
relaxivity was similar to the relaxivity of BSA-GdDTPA 196
mM1s1 (per BSA).
MRI data acquired from MLS tumor–bearing mice 24 hours after
administration of daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA or BSA-GdDTPA (12 mg/
200 AL; n = 5–7 per group), showed significantly higher contrast
enhancement, consistent with accumulation of daidzein-BSAGdDTPA in the tumor site compared with vehicle-injected mice
or mice injected with BSA-GdDTPA (Fig. 6B). Time course
experiments showed specific localization and retention of targeted
contrast agent (daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA; n = 7) in the tumor site 24,
48, and 72 hours after injection compared with controls or mice
injected with non targeted contrast agent (BSA-GdDTPA; n = 5).
Statistically significant elevation of R 1 relaxation was visualized in
tumors injected with daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA compared with noninjected animals or mice injected with BSA-GdDTPA ( for 24 hours,
P = 0.01; 48 hours, P = 0.016; 72 hours, P = 0.0488; Fig. 6C).
Prolonged detection of the targeted contrast material was
feasible even for a lower administered dose. MLS tumor–bearing
mice were injected with daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA (4 mg/200 AL;

n = 3). The specific localization of the targeted contrast agent in
the tumor site was detected by MRI at 9.4T 24 hours after injection
and was still detectable and even enhanced 7 days after injection
(Fig. 6D, arrows).
The effects of BSA overload were studied on MLS tumor–bearing
mice injected with daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA (4 mg) or combination
of daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA and BSA-FAM. R1 of the tumor area was
monitored after 24 hours. Elevation in R1 was observed for the
tumor from animal injected with combination of daidzein-BSAGdDTPA and BSA-FAM compared with the control animals
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

Discussion
Despite the high permeability tumor neovasculature to plasma
proteins, targeting of contrast media and delivery of therapeutics
to tumors is frequently compromised leading to poor sensitivity for
tumor detection and resistance to therapy. The low transfer rate
was attributed to high interstitial pressure, and indeed a number of
studies reported improved delivery with vascular normalization
induced by antiangiogenic therapy (21), or alteration of extracellular matrix using hyaluronidase (22).
In the study reported here, we explored yet another mechanism
for tumor escape from delivery of extravasated albumin-based
contrast media, through caveolae-mediated sequestration of the
contrast material by perivascular myofibroblasts, thus generating
an effective tumor-blood barrier. Evoking alternate competing
endocytic pathway using daidzein resulted in significant partition
of the contrast material into the tumor, which could be further
enhanced through suppression of caveolae-mediated endocytosis
by competition with albumin.
The phytoestrogen daidzein bound to BSA was used here as a
macromolecular bifunctional contrast agent targeting ovarian
carcinoma cells. In vivo imaging of daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA/
CyTE777 allowed MRI and NIR imaging detection and analysis of
the interaction between endocytic pathways in MLS human
epithelial ovarian carcinoma xenografts.
The in vitro use of carboxy derivatives of isoflavones as carriers
for affinity targeting of drugs to tumor cells expressing estrogen
receptor of the h type was recently reported (13, 15, 23). Acting
as a weak estrogen, daidzein may recognize a putative plasma
membrane estrogen receptor and a membrane-located estrogen
receptor h–related protein. Additionally, daidzein was reported to
interact with the lipid interface on the cell surface (24), thus
facilitating endocytosis. It has been reported that caveolin-1
colocalizes with plasma membrane estrogen receptor in lipid rafts

(25). Gilad and colleagues (26) reported the importance of caveolin1 in the compartmentalization of estrogen receptor h to the
membrane, allowing 17h-estradiol (E2) to control vitamin D
receptor transcription and expression. Daidzein could interact also
with raft-located estrogen receptor like protein that did not
cointeract with calveolae (27).
As reported here, MLS human epithelial ovarian carcinoma
cells express low levels of caveolin-1 that can mediate the BSA
uptake to the MLS cells. As expected, inhibition of caveolae uptake
using nystatin suppressed cellular internalization of fluorescently
tagged BSA, and changed the pattern of cellular localization of
this agent, leading to membrane staining and inhibition of
endocytosis.
Cellular uptake of daidzein-BSA-FAM and BSA-ROX alone and in
combination showed segregation of the labels, suggesting independent uptake pathways for daidzein-BSA and BSA. Surprisingly,
nystatin significantly augmented the cellular uptake of daidzeinBSA-FAM, whereas the uptake of BSA-ROX was slightly suppressed
by nystatin along with a shift toward membranal localization,
suggesting that although daidzein-BSA-FAM is internalized
through a caveolae-independent endocytic pathway, its uptake
can be attenuated by the interaction of BSA with caveolin. Similar
to the effect of nystatin, administration of BSA-ROX effectively
increased daidzein-BSA-FAM uptake. These results are consistent
with the presence of two competing and mutually exclusive
endocytic pathways for daidzein-BSA-FAM, where one of them is
BSA mediated and caveolae dependent, and the second is daidzein
mediated and caveolae independent.
In vivo, NIR imaging showed specific localization and prolonged
retention of daidzein-BSA-CyTE777 in ovarian carcinoma tumors,
compared with BSA-CyTE777. Similarly elevated enhancement of
tumors was observed by MRI for daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA relative to

www.aacrjournals.org

BSA-GdDTPA, and contrast media retention in the tumors could be
detected up to 7 days after administration of the contrast media.
Enhancement of contrast seemed to develop with time after
administration. Such behavior is consistent with quenching of
relaxivity upon internalization of the contrast media with
subsequent enhancement of relaxivity with cell proliferation and
intracellular redistribution of the contrast media. Such changes in
contrast media relaxivity were previously reported by us for
endocytic uptake of BSA-GdDTPA (9, 10, 19).
In accord with the in vitro results, it is important to consider
that retention of the NIR signal in the tumor area is amplified by
the intrinsic competition with the endogenous mouse albumin that
can compete with daidzein-BSA for uptake by caveolae. Furthermore, uptake of daidzein-BSA could be further amplified by
exogenously delivered BSA overload. Further analysis is required
to establish the optimal concentration of albumin required for
maximal delivery of daidzein-BSA. Importantly, hypoalbuminemia
(28), a common complication in patients with advanced cancer (29)
and a major side effect of some chemotherapeutic agents (30–33),
can affect the delivery of daidzein-BSA, and thus supplementation
with exogenous albumin should be considered.
Histologic analysis revealed a major difference in the distribution
of daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA and BSA-GdDTPA in tumors. Effective
distribution of daidzein-BSA-FAM was observed inside the tumor
nodules, whereas BSA-FAM was predominantly localized within
blood vessels and in the perivascular tumor stroma myofibroblasts
as reported previously (10).
The study reported here was performed on subcutaneous tumor
xenografts that are typically characterized by extensive fibrous
reaction. This choice of model facilitated quantification of the
contrast media. However, the clinical relevance of the model is
nevertheless clear, as extensive involvement of stroma is common

to many human carcinomas. Fibroblast involvement was reported
for the supportive stroma of breast (34, 35) and prostate (36, 37)
carcinomas, contributing to angiogenesis (38), abnormal composition of extracellular matrix (39), and fibrosis development (40).
Targeting caveolae was suggested previously as a mechanism for
facilitation of transendothelial transfer so as to improve delivery of
therapeutics to tumors (41, 42). Similar to albumin-bound (nab)
paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel; Abraxane; refs. 43, 44) that was recently
approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer (45),
daidzein-BSA shows enhanced endothelial cell transcytosis (44),
enhanced permeability and retention effect, and prolonged half-life
time in the plasma. In addition, daidzein-BSA shows specific
affinity to ovarian cancer cells, using intrinsic competition with
albumin for saturating the caveolae pathway and enhancing tumor
cell uptake. Interestingly, fluorescently labeled Abraxane showed
limited partition to the tumor cells and significant perivascular
accumulation, suggesting possible uptake by perivascular stroma
cells (46).
In summary, we reported here the use of MRI and NIR imaging
for in vivo dissection of two independent endocytic pathways
affecting contrast media retention by human epithelial ovarian
carcinoma cells. As shown here, daidzein-BSA-GdDTPA/CyTE777
could potentially facilitate the detection of ovarian tumor lesions
and metastasis, further research is required for validating the
ability to detect targeted contrast media for peritoneal metastases.
Based in previous reports, this system potentially may be used for
detection of other types of cancer that are daidzein sensitive,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

including prostate (47, 48) and breast (49, 50). The mutually
exclusive competing mechanisms for daidzein and BSA-mediated
uptake could be further exploited for augmenting the selective
targeted delivery of therapy to ovarian carcinoma cells through
suppression of caveolae binding. Moreover, the ability to manipulate caveolae-mediated internalization allowed us to effectively
overcome the tumor-blood barrier mediated by caveolae sequestration of albumin in perivascular tumor myofibroblasts, thus
augmenting delivery of the contrast media to the tumor cells. In
view of the cardinal role of albumin in affecting the availability and
pharmacokinetics of drugs, this approach could potentially also
facilitate the delivery of therapeutics to tumor cells.
