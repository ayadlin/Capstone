ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer related death
worldwide. The number of deaths is proportional to the global incidence, which
highlights the aggressive tumor biology and lack of effective therapies. Dysregulation
of microRNAs has been implicated in carcinogenesis and progression of liver cancer.
Here, we identified that miR-1258 was significantly downregulated in HCC and
associated with poor patients’ survival. Overexpression of miR-1258 significantly
inhibits liver cancer cell growth, proliferation and tumorigenicity through increasing
cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and promotes cell apoptosis. Interestingly, stable
overexpression of miR-1258 suppresses cell migration, stemness and increases
sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapy drug like doxorubicin. The CDC28 protein
kinase regulatory subunit 1B (CKS1B) was identified as a functional downstream
target of miR-1258. Re-expression of CKS1B overcomes miR-1258 induced apoptosis
and increases stemness of HCC cells, suggesting that loss of miR-1258 contributes to
carcinogenesis and progression of liver cancer through targeting CKS1B . Therefore,
loss of miR-1258 may be a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and blocking
miR-1258-CKS1B axis is a potential therapeutic strategy in HCC.

INTRODUCTION

at advanced disease stages, and in this setting, sorafenib is
currently the only FDA approved targeted therapy drug to
improve overall survival. Even if after curative resection
in patients with early-stage disease, tumour recurrence
is estimated to occur in 70% of patients. The adjuvant
sorafenib for HCC after resection or ablation (STORM) is
a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial, which indicated that sorafenib is not an effective
intervention in the adjuvant setting for HCC following
resection or ablation [2]. Thus, the study of novel factors
contributing to carcinogenesis and progression of liver
cancer needs to be investigated.
Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs), a kind of small
non-coding RNAs expressed in different tissue and cell
types, are critical regulator of innumerous biological

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most
common type of primary liver cancer (70%–90%) and is
seen more often in men than in women. It is the second
leading cause of cancer death among men in developing
countries and the sixth leading cause of cancer death
among men in developed countries. An estimated 782,500
new liver cancer cases and 745,500 deaths occurred
worldwide during 2012, with China alone accounting for
about 50% of the total number of cases and deaths[1]. The
current management of HCC patients includes surgical
resection, liver transplantation, radiofrequency ablation,
transcatheter arterial chemoem­
bolization (TACE) or
sorafenib. Unfortunately, most patients are still diagnosed

processes that suppress the expression of target genes.
The dysregulated miRNA expression has been correlated
with many human diseases including HCC. Over the past
few years, increasing studies have evaluated the role of
miRNAs in hepatocarcinogenesis and tumor progression.
The diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic potential of
miRNA has been shown in HCC [3, 4]. Studies comparing
the microRNA profiles of diseased and normal tissues
from patients with HCC have revealed consistent changes
in the expression of many miRNAs. As a result, genes
regulated by these miRNAs are also abnormally expressed,
which can contribute to the development of HCC.
Through combination miRNA expression profile of liver
HCC (LIHC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
and the other HCC miRNA expression profile dataset
(GSE36915). Many consistently dysregulated miRNAs in
HCC were identified. Among them, the dysregulation and
role of miR-1258 in HCC has not been investigated.
In this study, we found that miR-1258 was
significantly downregulated in HCC and associated with
poor patients’ survival. Overexpression of miR-1258
significantly inhibits the expression of CDC28 protein
kinase regulatory subunit 1B (CKS1B) and overcomes
oncogenic properties in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo
of HCC cells. This study suggested that loss of miR-1258
correlates to the expression level of CKS1B to influence
the carcinogenesis of HCC and is likely to become the key
strategy to the treatment of HCC.

expression data suggested that loss of miR-1258 may
contribute to the development of HCC.

Overexpression of miR-1258 inhibits liver cancer
cell growth and proliferation
Consistently, the downregulation of miR-1258
was also observed in a panel of liver cancer cell lines
(Figure 2A). To investigate the critical role of miR-1258,
we stably transfected two HCC cells with p-miR-1258
or p-miR-control plasmid to overexpress miR-1258.
The RT-qPCR analysis showed that the expression of
miR- 1258 was significantly increased in the selected
stably transfected cells compared to untransfected control
cells or p-miR-control plasmid stably transfected cells
(Figure 2B). The cell growth was dramatically reduced
by overexpression of miR-1258 in HuH7 and HCCLM3
cells (*P < 0.05, Figure 2C and 2D). Overexpression of
miR-1258 also significantly inhibit the colony formation
ability of HuH7 and HCCLM3 in soft agar, suggesting that
miR-1258 inhibits cellular anchorage-independent growth
of HCC cells in vitro (Figure 2E and 2F). Thus, these
data revealed that loss of miR-1258 in HCC promotes
tumor cell growth and proliferation and re- expression
of miR- 
1258 inhibits liver cancer cell growth and
proliferation.

miR-1258 induces cell cycle arrest in G0/G1
phase and promotes cell apoptosis

RESULTS

Cell cycle progression and apoptosis are two crucial
causes of sustaining cell growth and proliferation. To
further understanding the potential mechanisms by which
overexpression of miR-1258 inhibits HCC cell growth and
proliferation, we assessed cell cycle and apoptosis in HCC
cell lines after miR-1258 overexpression. Flow cytometric
analysis of cell cycle with propidium iodide (PI) in HuH7
and HCCL3 cells demonstrated that overexpression of
miR-1258 led to a significant accumulation of cells at G0/
G1-phase and a significant increase in cells in sub-G0,
representing apoptotic cells (Figure 3A). Consistently,
overexpression of miR-1258 also significantly increased
the Annexin V+ cell population, which indicates the
increase of cell apoptosis (Figure 3B). This data suggested
that miR-1258 induced suppression of HCC cells growth
and proliferation appeared to be correlated with increasing
of cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and cell apoptosis in
HCC cells.

miR-1258 was significantly downregulated in
HCC and associated with patients’ survival
To identify the consistently dysregulated miRNAs
in HCC, we combined the miRNA expression profile of
LIHC from TCGA and the other HCC miRNA expression
profile dataset (GSE36915), which has miRNA expression
profile of 68 HCC and 21 non-tumor liver tissues. A panel
of consistently dysregulated miRNAs were identified
in both datasets. Among them, the downregulation of
miR-1258 was consistently observed in both TCGA
(Figure 1A) and GSE36915 (Figure 1B). We further
validated several consistently dysregulated miRNAs of
TCGA and GSE36915 in 20 pair of HCC tissues with
recurrence and metastasis information by real time
quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). The
results showed that the expression of miR-1258 was
significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared to
adjacent normal samples (Figure 1C). Downregulation of
miR-1258 in HCC was also shown to be associated with
tumor recurrence and metastasis (Figure 1D and 1E).
Furthermore, when survival analysis was performed using
the median expression values of miR-1258, low expression
of miR- 1258 in HCC was significantly associated with
poor disease-free survival (Figure 1F). These clinical

that low expression of miR-1258 was associated with

recurrence and metastasis of HCC has not been well
characterized. We examined whether miR-1258 was a
critical molecular on HCC cell migration by the transwell
migration assay. As shown, overexpression of miR-1258
significantly suppressed the migration rates of HuH7
and HCCLM3 cells (Figure 4A and 4B). Increasing
evidence suggested that the stemness of cancer cells is
thought to be responsible for cancer initiation, recurrence
and drug resistance. We next investigated the effects of
miR-1258 on stemness and drug sensitivity of HCC
cells. The tumor sphere formation results showed that
overexpression of miR-1258 significantly inhibits sphere
formation ability of HCC cells (Figure 4C and 4D). Since
single-agent doxorubicin has been widely used to treat
unresectable HCC, we then assayed the drug sensitivity
to doxorubicin by comparing miR-1258 overexpressing
cells and the according control cells. The results showed
that overexpression of miR-1258 significantly contributed
to increasing the sensitivity of HCC cells to doxorubicin
(Figure 4E and 4F). These data collectively indicated
that miR-1258 suppresses cell migration and stemness to
increase drug sensitivity.

The expression of CKS1B was negatively correlated
with the expression of miR-1258 in HCC tissue
samples (Figure 5F). The overexpression of CKS1B in
HCC was also shown in TCGA dataset (Figure S1A).
The expression correlation between CKS1B and p27
(CDKN1B), or CKS1B and IL8 in TCGA dataset was
marginal or no correlation, but a significant negative
correlation was also observed between miR-1258 and
CKS1B in TCGA (Figure S1B– S1D). These data support
that CKS1B was the critical downstream target of
miR-1258.

Re-expression of CKS1B overcomes miR-1258
induced apoptosis and increases stemness
To investigate whether miR-1258 exerted its effects
by regulating CKS1B in HCC cells, we re- expressed the
coding region sequences (CDS) of CKS1B in miR- 1258
transfected HCCLM3 cells using pWZL- CKS1B plasmid
transfection. Western blot analysis was performed to
confirm the overexpression effect of CKS1B levels
(Figure 6A). Overexpression of CKS1B was also shown
to decrease the expression of p27 and increase the
expression of IL8. The MTS assay and soft agar colony
formation assay results showed that overexpression
of CKS1B promotes HCCLM3-miR-1258 stable cell
growth and proliferation (Figure 6B and 6C). Meanwhile,
Annexin V/7-AAD staining and flow cytometry analysis
also showed that re-expression of CKS1B overcomes
miR-1258 induced the increasing of Annexin V+
cell population, suggesting re-expression of CKS1B
overcomes miR-1258 induced apoptosis (Figure 6D).
The tumor sphere formation results also showed that
re-expression of CKS1B significantly promotes sphere
formation ability of miR-1258 transfected HCC cells. Reexpression of CKS1B induces much more and large tumor
spheres (Figure 6E), suggesting re-expression of CKS1B
increases stemness ability of miR-1258 transfected HCC
cells. These data suggested that re-expression of CKS1B
overcomes miR-1258 induced apoptosis and increases
stemness of HCC cells.

CKS1B was identified as the critical downstream
target of miR-1258
To understand the molecular mechanisms by
which miR-1258 suppresses oncogenic properties of
HCC cells, we used two different bioinformatics tools
(TargetScan and miRDB) to predict putative target
genes of miR- 1258. Among the 36 potential candidates
predicted by TargetScan and miRDB (Table S1),
CKS1B, CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit
1B, was further validated as the target of miR-1258. A
predicted binding site for miR-1258 was identified in
the 3′-UTR of CKS1B mRNA by TargetScan (Figure
5A) and miRDB (Figure 5B). To determine whether
CKS1B is a direct target of miR- 1258, we constructed
luciferase reporter plasmids using pGL3 plasmid
encoding the wild-type 3′-UTR region of CKS1B
(pGL3-CKS1B-3′UTR) or a mutated binding site of
CKS1B 3′-UTR region (pGL3-CKS1B-3′UTR-mut).
As shown in Figure 5C, overexpression of miR-1258
significantly decreased the relative luciferase activity
of the CKS1B-WT-3′UTR reporter in HCC cells (P <
0.05), whereas the activity of the CKS1B-3′UTR-mut
reporter was not affected by miR-1258. In addition,
miR-1258 overexpression also significantly decreased
the expression level of CKS1B protein in HCC cells
(Figure 5D). Inhibition of CKS1B also contributes to
increased expression of p27 and decreased expression
of IL8, which are two important downstream targets
of CKS1B [5]. qRT- PCR analysis showed that the
expression of CKS1B was significantly overexpressed in
HCC compared to adjacent normal samples (Figure 5E).

Stable overexpression of miR-1258 decreases
tumorigenicity of HCC cells
The effects of miR-1258 overexpression on the
growth and proliferation of HCC cells were further
confirmed by examining tumorigenicity in vivo.
Immunodeficient BALB/C mice were subcutaneously
injected with HCCLM3 cells that had been previously
stable transfected with p-miR-1258 or p-miR-control.
Throughout the tumorigenic period, the tumors formed
from p-miR-1258-expressing HCCLM3 cells grew
significantly slower than those formed from p-miR- control
expressing cells (Figure 7A). After 35 days, the volume

of the tumors generated from p-miR- 1258-expressing
HCCLM3 cells were significantly smaller than those
generated by p-miR-control-expressing cells (Figure 7B).
The immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tumor
tissues showed that the expression of CKS1B was
significantly decreased, while the expression of p27 was
significantly decreased in the tumor tissues formed from
p-miR-1258-expressing HCCLM3 cells compared to those
generated by p-miR-control-expressing cells (Figure 7C).
The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assay also detect more TUNEL+
apoptosis cells in the tumor tissues formed from p-miR1258-expressing HCCLM3 cells compared to those
generated by p-miR-control-expressing cells (Figure 7D).
These data suggested that stable overexpression of miR1258 decreases tumorigenicity of HCC cells by inducing
apoptosis.

and critical role of miR-1258 in HCC have never been
reported. Previous studies have showed that miR-1258
expression is attenuated in human breast cancer cells
and patient tissues, and miR-1258 suppresses breast
cancer brain metastasis by targeting heparanase (HSPE)
[12, 13]. The miR-1258 has also been shown to inhibit the
expression level of HPSE to influence the morbidity and
metastasis of NSCLC. The miR-1258 is likely to become
the key to the treatment of lung cancer metastasis [14].
Here, we demonstrated that miR-1258 was significantly
downregulated in HCC tissues and that decreased miR1258 expression was associated with worse clinicpathological characteristics such as tumor recurrence and
metastasis and a poor prognosis. miR-1258 overexpression
inhibited cell growth, proliferation, cell cycle arrest,
apoptosis, migration and stemness of HCC cells in vitro
and tumorigenicity in vivo. These data suggested that
miR-1258 may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic
candidate of HCC.
Previous few studies identified that HPSE is a
target of miR-1258 in breast [12, 13] and lung cancer
[14]. However, there is no expression correlation
between miR-1258 and HSPE in TCGA LIHC dataset,
suggesting HSPE may not a critical target of miR1258 in HCC (Figure S2). Further experiments
indicated that miR-1258 directly targeted the CKS1B
to suppress oncogenic properties of HCC cells. An
inverse correlation between miR-1258 and CKS1B
levels was found in HCC tissues. These results suggest
that loss of miR-1258 may play an important role in
the carcinogenesis of HCC with increasing of CKS1B.
CKS1B has been shown overexpression in aggressive
disease and regulated multiple myeloma growth and
survival through SKP2- and p27Kip1-dependent and
-independent mechanisms [15]. SKP2 and CKS1 have
also been shown to promote degradation of cell cycle
regulators and are associated with HCC prognosis
[16]. The following study showed that CKS1B protein
overexpression in HCCs is implicated in clinical
aggressiveness but not in p27(Kip1) turnover, implying
presence of p27(Kip1)-independent oncogenic attributes
[17]. CKS1 supports hepatocarcinogenesis by NF-κBmediated regulation of IL-8 expression, broadening the
function of Cks1 in cancer beyond its role as a Skp2
cofactor in p27 ubiquitination [5]. Here, our study
also showed that suppression of CKS1B by miR-1258
contributes to increased expression of p27 and decreased
expression of IL8, suggesting both p27 and IL8 may
play important role on mediating the critical role of
miR-1258-CKS1B network in HCC. Taken together,
these results demonstrate that loss of miR-1258 may be
a diagnosis and prognostic biomarker and that the miR1258-CKS1B axis is a potential therapeutic target in
HCC.

DISCUSSION
Increasing evidence has uncovered the
contribution of miRNAs to pathogenesis of HCC
because they can function as oncogenes or tumor
suppressor genes. Certain miRNAs, called oncomiRs,
play a causal role in the onset and maintenance of cancer
when overexpressed. Tumors that depend on these
microRNAs are regarded to display oncomiR addiction.
Inhibition of oncomiRs using antisense oligomers
(antimiRs) has been shown as an evolving therapeutic
strategy [6]. Previous studies have demonstrated their
potential value in the clinical management of patients
with HCC as some miRNAs may be used as prognostic
or diagnostic markers as well as potential therapeutic
targets [7, 8]. For instance, systemic administration of
miR-26a, a miRNA that is normally expressed at high
levels in normal liver but decreased in HCC cells, in
a mouse model of HCC using adeno-associated virus
(AAV) results in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation,
induction of tumor-specific apoptosis, and dramatic
protection from disease progression without toxicity [9].
Moreover, the miR-26 expression status of HCC patients
is associated with survival and response to adjuvant
therapy with interferon alfa [10]. The administration
of the liposomal formulated miR-34a mimic caused
significant tumor growth inhibition in two different
orthotopic liver cancer models and tumor regression
was observed in more than one-third of the animals [11].
Therefore, understanding the critical role of miRNAs in
HCC will provide a new tool for diagnostic, prognostic,
and therapeutic potential.
In this study, we combined the miRNA expression
profile of LIHC from TCGA and GSE36915. The
downregulation of miR-1258 was consistently observed
in both TCGA and GSE36915. However, the expression

mice via subcutaneous injections. Tumor volumes were
determined each week by measuring their length (a)
and width (b) using a vernier caliper. The tumor volume
(V) was calculated according to the formula V = ab2/2.
The statistical significance between tumor sizes in the
P-miR-1258 and P-miR-control transfected groups was
evaluated using the Student’s t test. The tumors were fixed
in 10% neutral buffered formalin before being processed
into paraffin blocks. The tissue sections were stained with
CKS1B and p27 (Abcam) using standard IHC techniques.
TUNEL staining was performed using the DeadEnd
fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The number of TUNEL-positive
cells was calculated under microscope.

RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis
Total RNA from the tissue samples or cell lines was
extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
USA). The quality and quantity of isolated total RNA were
assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and NanoDrop
ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA,
USA). The qRT-PCR was performed as described [18] and
the detail was descripted in the supporting information.

Establish of stable cells and cell viability analysis
The HuH7 and HCCLM3 cell were seeded in
six well plate and transfected with p-miR-1258 and
p-miR- control plasmids (System Biosciences, USA).
48 hour after transfection, cells were trypsinized and
seeded at 1: 10 dilution in 100 cm2 dishes. The puromycin
(1 ug/ml for HuH7 and 3 ug/ml for HCCLM3) was added
at 72 hours after transfection for selection. The stable cells
clone were selected and examined by qRT-PCR. The cell
viability was assessed by MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2Htetra zolium] assays using the CellTiter 96 AQueous
One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit from Promega
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Each

The 3′-UTR sequence of CKS1B predicted to bind
with miR-1258 or a mutated sequence within the predicted
target sites was synthesized and inserted into the XbaI and
FseI sites of the pGL3 control vector (Promega, Madison,
WI). These constructs were named as pGL3-CKS1B3′UTR or pGL3-CKS1B-3′UTR-mut, respectively. The
detail of luciferase reporter assay was performed as
descripted in the supporting information
