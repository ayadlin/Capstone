Abstract
Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process of cancer invasion and metastasis, is associated
with stemness property of cancer cells. Though Oct4 and Nanog are homebox transcription factors essential to
the self-renewal of stem cells and are expressed in several cancers, the role of Oct4/Nanog signaling in
tumorigenesis is still elusive. Here microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed a parallel,
elevated expression of Oct4 and Nanog in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). Ectopic expressions of Oct4 and Nanog in
LACs increased the percentage of CD133-expressing subpopulation and sphere formation, enhanced drug
resistance, and promoted EMT. Ectopic expressions of Oct4 and Nanog activated Slug and enhanced the tumorinitiating capability of LAC. Furthermore, double knockdown of Oct4 and Nanog suppressed the expression of
Slug, reversed the EMT process, blocked the tumorigenic and metastatic ability, and greatly improved the mean
survival time of transplanted immunocompromised mice. The immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated
that expressions of Oct4, Nanog, and Slug were present in high-grade LAC, and triple positivity of Oct4/Nanog/
Slug indicated a worse prognostic value of LAC patients. Our results support the notion that the Oct4/Nanog
signaling controls epithelial–mesenchymal transdifferentiation, regulates tumor-initiating ability, and promotes
metastasis of LAC. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10433–44. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related
deaths worldwide (1). In particular, lung adenocarcinoma
(LAC) is the most common histologic type. Its highly invasive
and metastatic phenotypes are the major reasons for treatment failure and poor prognosis. Furthermore, a high failure
rate and a low median survival rate are observed in patients
undergoing chemoradiotherapy with recurrent, intractable
LAC (2). To improve the patient survival, it is important to
elucidate the regulatory mechanisms that control tumorinitiating and metastatic properties of LAC.

Self-renewal and pluripotency are the central features in the
definition of embryonic stem cells (ESC), in which Oct4 and
Nanog play a key role in the maintenance of these processes (3,
4). Oct4, a member of the Pit-Oct-Unc (POU) transcription
factor family, is essential to maintain self-renewal and is
normally found in totipotent or pluripotent stem cells of
pregastrulation embryos (3, 5). Nanog, a downstream target
of Oct4, contributes to cell fate determination of the pluripotent inner cell mass during embryonic development (6) and its
function requires the continued presence of Oct4 (7). Oct4 and
Nanog have been suggested as 1 of 4 defined factors that
render the reprogramming capability of adult cells into germline-competent–induced pluripotent stem cells (8–10). Previous studies also showed that mouse pulmonary stem cells
endogenously express Oct4 (11). Oct4 was demonstrated to
participate in tumorigenicity and malignancy of lung cancers
(12). The expression of Oct4 has further been shown in human
breast cancer stem-like cells, implicating its involvement in
self-renewal and tumorigenesis via activating its downstream
target genes (13). Similar to Oct4, immunohistochemical
analysis of colorectal tumor samples showed that overexpression of Nanog was strongly correlated with poor prognosis,
lymph node metastasis, and Dukes classification of colorectal
cancer (14). Recently, both Oct4 and Nanog transcripts
were consistently detected in human embryonic carcinomas,
testicular germ cell tumors, seminomas, and bladder carcinomas (15–18). Furthermore, coexpression of Oct4 and Nanog
is associated with pancreatic carcinogenesis (19) and is

Oct4 and Nanog Enhance Cancer Stem Cell–Like Properties

negatively correlated with the survival prognosis of oral
squamous cell carcinoma patients (20). There is growing
evidence of cross-talk and correlation between stemness
pathways, tumor progression, and metastasis; the functional
and mechanistic significance of the overexpressed stem cell
markers in cancer, however, is still blurred and needs to be
further clarified.
Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a transdifferentiation program that converts adherent epithelial cells into
individual migratory cells, is critical for embryonic development and the oncogenic progression of tumor cells (21, 22).
The EMT process disrupts E-cadherin mediated cell–cell
adhesion during embryonic development and changes the
cell phenotype into a more loosely mesenchymal-like cell,
leading to the invasion of extracellular matrix. Intensive
studies revealed that transcriptional factors, such as Snail,
Slug, and Twist, regulate EMT process (21, 22).
The recent study suggested that EMT could promote the
property of stemness in normal breast tissues as well as breast
cancer cells (23). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in the regulatory links between EMT and stem
cell–related genes are still poorly understood. In this study, we
discovered that both Oct4 and Nanog are highly expressed in
CD133þ but not in CD133 LAC cells, suggesting a positive
involvement of Oct4/Nanog signaling in tumorigenesis. We
further investigate the roles of Oct4 and Nanog in EMT
process, cancer progression, and metastasis of lung cancer.
We found a significant coexpression of Oct4 and Nanog in
high-grade and metastatic lesions of patients with LAC.
Ectopic expression of Oct4 and Nanog in A549 LAC cells
increases tumor-initiating properties, induces EMT and drug
resistance, and promotes metastasis. This report provides the
evidence bridging the missing link between EMT and stemness pathways and suggests a mechanism by which the Oct4/
Nanog stem cell signaling encourages tumor malignancy and
metastasis of LAC cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
A549 lung cancer cell line was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection before 2007 and tested positive for
human origin and for the presence of EGFR expression in the
current genetic analysis. A549 cells were grown in RPMI-1640
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Virus generation and infection
Virus generation and infection were performed as described
(24). Briefly, 2.2  106 HEK293T cells were seeded onto a 100mm culture dish 1 day before transfection. Cells were cotransfected with 10 mg of the pLKO.1-based lentiviral vector, 9 mg of

D8.9 plasmid, and 2.5 mg of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein
plasmid. The medium was replaced with normal culture
medium 24 hours later, and the virus-containing medium
was collected 48 hours after transfection. Lentiviral infection
was performed by adding virus solution to cells at the desired
multiplicity of infection in the presence of 8 ng/mL polybrene.
Puromycin selection was performed 24 hours after infection
until all of the mock-transfected cells died. Surviving cells were
pooled and cultured for further analysis.
Microarray analysis and bioinformatics
Total RNA extraction was performed as described (24).
Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript II
RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Gibco BRL) to generate Cy3and Cy5-labeled (Amersham Biosciences Co.) cDNA probes for
the control and treated samples, respectively. The labeled
probes were hybridized to a cDNA microarray containing
10,000 gene clone immobilized cDNA fragments. Fluorescence
intensities of Cy3 and Cy5 targets were measured and scanned
separately using a GenePix 4000B Array Scanner (Axon Instruments). Data analysis was performed using GenePix Pro
3.0.5.56 (Axon Instruments) and GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 software
(Agilent). The average linkage distance was used to assess the
similarity between 2 groups of gene expression profiles as
described below. The difference in distance between 2 groups
of sample expression profiles to a third was assessed by
comparing the corresponding average linkage distances [the
mean of all pairwise distances (linkages) between members of
the 2 groups concerned]. The error of such a comparison was
estimated by combining the standard errors (the standard
deviation of pairwise linkages divided by the square root of the
number of linkages) of the average linkage distances involved.
Classical multidimensional scaling was performed using the
standard function of the R program to provide a visual
impression of how the various sample groups are related (25).
Sphere formation assay
Cells were plated in 24-well plates (Falcon; BD) at a density
of 5,000 viable cells/mL and grown in a serum-free Dulbecco's
modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Sigma), supplemented with
N2 plus media supplement (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL of EGF and
20 ng/mL of bFGF (Invitrogen), and 4 mg/mL of heparin
(Sigma). Cells were further allowed to grow for 12 days,
and the numbers of spheres were counted by microscope.
Patients and tissue samples
LAC and adjacent nontumorous lung tissues were obtained
at the time of surgery from 20 patients in Taipei Medical
University Hospital and granted by the Institutional Review
Board protocol number 010804. All patients gave their
informed consent, and the ethics and scientific committees

of the participating institutions approved the study. Tumor
types were determined according to WHO classification. At
the time of surgery, all tissue samples were immediately flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C until use.
Xenograft tumorigenicity assay
Virus-infected A549 cells were harvested, washed with PBS,
and resuspended in normal culture medium. A549 cells (1 
106) infected with Oct4/Nanog or control vector were injected
subcutaneously into the right and left side, respectively, of the
flank region of 8-week-old male BALB/c nude mice (Rodent
Model Resource Center). Tumors were measured with calipers
the days after injection as indicated. All mice were anesthetized and killed by overdose with anesthetic on day 42 after
injection. Subcutaneous tumors were surgically excised,
weighed, and photographed.
Statistical analysis
The results are reported as mean  SD. Statistical analysis
was performed using Student's t test or a 1-way or 2-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by Tukey's test,
as appropriate. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Results
Microarray analysis of stemness-related gene
expression profiling and linkages in primary
and metastatic tissues of LAC
Recent reports have demonstrated that tumors contain a
small subpopulation of cells, termed cancer stem-like or
cancer-initiating cells, which exhibit a self-renewal capacity
and are responsible for tumor maintenance and metastasis
(26). Eramo and colleagues demonstrated that the small
population of lung cancer–initiating cells could be identified
by the CD133 surface marker (27). On the other hand, Oct4 was
shown to play a crucial role in maintenance of the CD133þ
lung cancer–initiating cells (12). We analyzed the genomic
traits of lung cancer LC-CD133þ and LC-CD133 cells using
gene expression microarray (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Tables S2,
S3). To gain more insights into the functional consequences
from differential gene expression patterns and to provide
quantitative evidence, signature genes were subjected into
the Gene Ontology database search to find statistically represented functional groups. The gene ontology categories of
biological processes statistically represented (P < 0.01) among
sphere-enriched genes are shown in Fig. 1A. The predominant
processes upregulated in LC-CD133þ include those pertaining
to mitosis, nuclear division, and cell-cycle regulation (Supplementary Table S2a). In contrast, the downregulated genes in
LC-CD133þ include those related to immune responses, cellto-cell adhesion, and cell biological adhesion (Supplementary Table S2b). Multidimensional scaling analysis showed
that the gene expression pattern of LC-CD133þ was closer to
that of metastatic lesion of LAC, but far from that of LCCD133 cells or primary lesion of LAC (Fig. 1B). In contrast,
the gene signature of LC-CD133 was closer to that of
primary lesion of LAC (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the microarray

10436

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

analysis showed that the expression levels of ESC-specific
genes, Oct4 and Nanog, were significantly upregulated in LCCD133þ and metastatic lesion of LAC compared to LCCD133 or primary lesion of LAC (P < 0.001; Supplementary
Table S3a). Twenty pairs of LAC and corresponding adjacent
nontumorous lung tissues were subjected to quantitative
real-time PCR analysis. The levels of Oct4 and Nanog RNA in
the 20 LAC tissues were measured and represented as
related levels compared to their adjacent nontumorous lung
tissue (Fig. 1C). General analysis showed that both Oct4 and
Nanog expressions were higher in LAC samples than in
adjacent nontumorous lung tissues by an average of 2.01fold (P ¼ 0.039) and 4.76-fold (P ¼ 0.029), respectively
(Fig. 1D). Approximately, 55% of the LAC samples contained
an Oct4 RNA level above that of patient-matched nontumorous lung tissues; similarly, 60% of the LAC samples contained a Nanog RNA level above that of patient-matched
adjacent nontumorous lung tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Most interestingly, we observed 40% LAC cells co-overexpressed Oct4 and Nanog simultaneously (Fig. 1C).
Oct4/Nanog overexpression enhances cancer
stem-like property in LAC cells
The co-overexpression pattern of Oct4 and Nanog in LAC
tissues suggests a signal pathway induced by Oct4/Nanog
circuit, which encourages tumorigenesis of LAC. We generated stable cell lines (A549-ON) from A549 human LAC cells
using lentiviral infection system with plasmid vectors encoding Oct4 and Nanog cDNA. An empty vector-transfected control (A549-Ctrl) was produced simultaneously. Interestingly,
Oct4 and Nanog co-overexpresion induced spindle phenotype
and foci formation of A549 cells, which normally exhibit a flat
brick-like morphology and hardly aggregate to each other
(Fig. 2A, top left). Colonies from A549-ON cells were selected
and subjected to stable clone selection. The exogenously
expressed Oct4 and Nanog in 3 A549-ON stable clones (Clones
1, 2, and 3) were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR
(Supplementary Figs. S2A and B) and Western Blot (Fig. 2A,
bottom left). Nuclear localization of Oct4 and Nanog in A549ON cells were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining
(Fig. 2A, right).
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the cancer
stem-like cell marker, CD133, was significantly elevated in all 3
A549-ON clones, ranging from 40- to 55-fold compared to their
parental A549-Ctrl cells (Fig. 2B, bottom). Flow cytometry
analysis showed an increased population of CD133þ cells in
A549-ON clones (Fig. 2B, top). About 15% to 44% of the cells
were determined as CD133þ in A549-ON clones, whereas
CD133þ cells were nearly undetectable in A549-Ctrl cells.
The mRNA level of another 2 stem cell–specific markers,
Mussashi-1 and Nestin, were also increased in A549-ON clones
(Supplementary Fig. S2C and D). The elevated stem cell–
specific markers suggested that A549-ON might have undergone certain process shifting cellular properties toward a state
closer to stem cell or cancer stem cell.
Sphere formation and drug resistance are 2 of the important
measurements used to define malignant cancers and cancer
stem-like cells. In functional analyses, we found that A549-ON

Oct4 and Nanog Enhance Cancer Stem Cell–Like Properties

Figure 2. Oct4/Nanog overexpression enhances cancer stem-like property in LAC cell line. A, A549 cells were infected with lentiviral vectors encoding
cDNA of Oct4 and Nanog (A549-ON) or a control empty vector (A549-Ctrl). A549-ON cells lost the epithelial phenotype and formed foci 12 days after
infection. In contrast, foci did not appear in A549-Ctrl cells. The scale bar represents a length of 50 mm (top left). A549-ON cells were subjected to stable clone
selection. Three A549-ON clones (#1, #2, and #3) were analyzed by Western blot for Oct4 and Nanog expression (bottom left). Immunofluorescence
staining was conducted for evaluating nuclear expression of Oct4 and Nanog (right). B, 3 A549-ON clones or A549-Ctrl were subjected to flow cytometry
(top) and quantitative real-time PCR (bottom) to analyze the population of CD133þ cell and CD133 mRNA expression, respectively. C, A549-ON clones
and A549-Ctrl were subjected to sphere formation assay. The sphere formation was photographed (top) and quantified (bottom). D, A549-ON clones
(#1, #3), A549-Ctrl, and none transfected A549 cells (A549) were treated with cisplatin (5, 10, and 20 mmol/L) for 48 hours. The viable cells were
distinguished by Trypan blue staining and counted using hemacytometer (left). A549-ON clones (#1, #2, and #3) or A549-Ctrl was subjected to
quantitative real-time PCR analysis for ABCB1 and ABCG5 multidrug resistant gene expression (right). Data shown are the mean  SD of 3 independent
experiments.

cells have acquired the ability to form sphere in suspension
culture (Fig. 2C) and were more sustainable to cisplatin
treatment (Fig. 2D, left). Quantitative real-time PCR also
showed that ABCB1, a member of the ABC family of multidrug
resistant genes, was highly enhanced in all selected A549-ON
clones (Fig. 2D, right).
Oct4/Nanog overexpression promotes in vivo
tumorigenic and metastatic abilities of A549 cells
A549-ON clones and A549-Ctrl cells were subcutaneously
injected in 8-week-old male BALB/c nude mice. Tumor growth
was monitored with calipers on the days after injection as
indicated (Fig. 3A). Significant increase in the growth rate of

the A549-ON tumors was observed. The tumors were then
surgically excised and weighed 8 weeks after injection
(Fig. 3B). The tumors generated by A549-ON cells were 5to 8-fold heavier than those by A549-Ctrl (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Interestingly, significant invasion into muscle layers
was observed in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the
A549-ON tumor sections (Fig. 3C, yellow arrow heads in the
top indicate muscle tissues). Compared to A549-Ctrl, a 12-fold
increase of mitotic cell number in the A549-ON tumor was
observed (Fig. 3C, bottom). Furthermore, staining of Alcian
blue and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which detect mucosubstances or glycoproteins in normal lung tissue, indicated a
decrease of lung-specific differentiation markers in A549-ON

of A549-ON cells (Fig. 3D).
A serial dilution experiment was performed to evaluate the
in vivo tumorigenecity of A549-ON cells. Nude mice were
injected with different number of cells as indicated. A549ON, but not A549 or A549-Ctrl, generated tumors with the cell
number as low as 3  103 cells (Table 1). Furthermore, tail vein
injection experiments showed that all 3 of the A549-ON–
injected mice contained metastatic lung tumors and 2 of 3
contained metastatic liver tumors, whereas only 1 A549-Ctrl–
injected mice contained metastatic lung tumors and none of
them contained metastatic liver tumors (Table 2).
Oct4/Nanog-mediated pathways regulate EMT
in lung cancer cells
As EMT is associated with tumor malignancy and metastasis, we investigated the effect of Oct4/Nanog signaling on
EMT process of LAC. We first observed that A549-ON cells contained a mesenchymal-like phenotype, whereas the A549-Ctrl
cells stay in their original epithelial-like morphology (Fig. 4A,
left). Western blotting analysis showed that the EMT-related
transcription factors, Snail and Slug, and the mesenchymal
markers, Vimentin and N-cadherin, were elevated in A549-ON
clones, whereas the epithelial markers, E-cadherin and Cytokeratin 18 (28), were suppressed (Fig. 4A, right). Functional
analyses further demonstrated that A549-ON cells exhibited
higher mobility and less dependence on anchorage for their
growth, respectively, compared to A549-Ctrl cells (Fig. 4B).
We generated Oct4/Nanog double knockdown cells (A549ON-shOct4þshNanog) from the previously established A549-

ON cells using shRNA approach to examine the effect of Oct4/
Nanog signaling on EMT. A randomly scrambled shRNAtransfected control (A549-ON-SC) was established simultaneously. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by
both quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 4C) and Western blot
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). The mRNA level of stem cell–
specific marker, CD133, and EMT-related transcription factor,
Slug, were reduced upon Oct4/Nanog double knockdown
(Fig. 4C, left). A reduced protein level of Snail and Slug, and
the elevation of E-cadherin and Cytokeratin 18 were also
observed in the A549-ON-shOct4þshNanog cells (Fig. 4C,
right). Moreover, Oct4/Nanog silencing was found to suppress
anchorage-independent cell growth and cell migration and
decrease sphere formation ability of A549-ON cells (Fig. 4D).
Knockdown of Oct4/Nanog signaling in A549-ON
cell retards its tumorigenecity and mobility
Subrenal injections were performed by transplanting 3 
103, 3  104, or 3  105 of A549-ON-shOct4þshNanog or A549ON-SC cells in nude mice. As shown in Table 1, the tumorigenicity of A549-ON-shOct4þshNanog cells was significantly
weaker than that of A549-ON-SC cells. The A549-ONshOct4þshNanog–injected mice generated tumors only when
transplanted with 3  105 cells or more (Table 1). A tail vein
injection experiment was then conducted with A549-ONshOct4þshNanog or A549-ON-SC cells. The metastatic tendency to lung or liver in A549-ON cells was prominently
blocked by the double knockdown of Oct4 and Nanog (Table 2).
Moreover, the number of tumor nodules and tumor volume in
lung of the transplanted mice were measured by ex vivo H&E

Oct4 and Nanog Enhance Cancer Stem Cell–Like Properties

Figure 5. Double knockdown of Oct4/Nanog decreased the in vivo tumorigenicity of A549-ON cells and prolonged the survival time of xenotransplanted

expressions of Oct4, Nanog, or Slug were positively associated
with high-grade LAC with moderate to poor differentiation
(Fig. 6A). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was then conducted
to determine the prognostic significance of Oct4, Nanog, or Slug
expression in patients with LAC. First, the results showed that
the Oct4-positive cases were associated with a considerably
worse overall survival rate compared with Oct4-negative ones
(Fig. 6B; P < 0.05). Second, patients with lower Nanog expres-

expressing patients (Fig. 6B; P < 0.01). Third, Slugþ patients had
a worse survival prognosis (Fig. 6B; P < 0.01). Finally, patients
positive for all 3 molecules (Oct4þNanogþSlugþ) had the worst
survival rate compared to other LAC patients (Fig. 6C; group 4
vs. other groups), whereas the triple negative for Oct4, Nanog,
and Slug had the most favorable survival as compared with
other groups (Fig. 6C; group 1 vs. other groups). The correlation

Discussion
Aberrant upregulation of EMT transcriptional factors,
Twist, Snail, and Slug, is associated with poor overall and

metastasis-free survival in patients with non–small cell lung
cancer (29). However, upstream regulatory pathways leading
to EMT-related metastasis in lung cancer remain unclear. It
has been shown that poorly differentiated tumors preferentially overexpress genes normally enriched in ESCs, and downstream targets of Oct4 and Nanog are more frequently
overexpressed in poorly differentiated tumors than in welldifferentiated ones (14, 20, 30–34).

Oct4 and Nanog Enhance Cancer Stem Cell–Like Properties

In the present study, we demonstrated that Oct4 and Nanog
are significantly upregulated in LAC patients (Figs. 1 and 6).
The bioinformatics and quantitative real-time PCR analysis
identified that both Oct4 and Nanog are co-overexpressed in
LAC (Fig. 1). Ectopic coexpression of Oct4 and Nanog converted A549 cells to a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Moreover,
there is evidence to support that Oct4 and Nanog encourage
the malignancy of lung cancer cells. First of all, A549-ON cells
exhibit enhanced sphere formation ability, elevated anchorage-independent growth, and increased mobility (Figs. 2
and 4). Second, A549-ON cells are highly tumorigenic and
metastatic, and this is reversed by Oct4/Nanog silencing
in transplanted mice (Figs. 3 and 5; Tables 1 and 2). Third,
immunohistochemical analysis showed that xenograft A549ON tumor exhibits poorly differentiated and fast mitotic
phenomenon (Fig. 3). Finally and most importantly, ectopically overexpressed Oct4/Nanog elevates mesenchymal markers and suppresses epithelial markers (Fig. 4). We propose
that Oct4/Nanog might positively regulate tumor metastasis
through enhancing EMT in LAC.
We have shown that Slug is a possible target for Oct4 and
Nanog and exerts their effect on the regulation of EMT. The
mRNA and protein levels of Slug are increased upon Oct4/
Nanog overexpression and decreased by RNAi-mediated Oct4/
Nanog knockdown (Fig. 4). The reporter assay further supported the regulatory role of Oct4/Nanog signaling on Slug
promoter (Supplementary Fig. S4). Because Oct4 binds Nanog
to activate gene expression in ESCs (35), it is possible that Oct4
and Nanog work together in their target genes to induce EMT.
Further characterizations are required to illustrate how Oct4
and Nanog regulate Slug or other EMT-related factors, if any.
Lung cancer is notorious for its difficult diagnosis at early
stage and poor recurrence-free prognosis. Advanced diagnostic methods and novel prognosis markers are urgently needed
to improve the clinical treatments of the disease. The studies
on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proposed that Oct4 mRNA
might be a biomarker for assessing the prognosis of HCC (32).
Recently, the elegant study by Bass and colleagues (36)

demonstrated that the DNA copy numbers of Sox2 were highly
amplified in lung and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. A
detailed analysis done by Hassan and colleagues (31) has
demonstrated that the expression profile of ESC-like genes,
including overlapped targets of Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2, is
preferentially detected in histologically poorly differentiated
LAC, but not lung squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting that
ESC genes may be involved in prognosis of LAC. In line with
their findings, our data further showed that the expression
levels of Oct4, Nanog, and Slug, individually or simultaneously,
are oppositely correlated with the 5-year survival rate of LAC
patients (Fig. 6). The clinical significance of Oct4/Nanog/Slug
would be worth exploring in the future.
In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that
Oct4 and Nanog induce cancer stem cell–like properties and
enhance EMT, contributing to the tumorigenesis and metastasis in LAC. The Oct4/Nanog-induced EMT could be regulated
partly, if not fully, via increasing Slug transcription. Moreover,
we have shown a correlation between the worse prognosis of
LAC patients and the high expression of Oct4/Nanog/Slug. We
propose that the Oct4/Nanog/Slug would be a potential marker
of prognosis and a novel target of therapy for LAC.
