BACKGROUND: Regional differences in health services can point to disparities in access to healthcare. The authors
performed a population-based cohort study to examine differences in ovarian cancer treatment and mortality
according to geographic region. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database was used to identify 4589 women aged 65 years with ovarian cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 who
had Medicare claims filed from 1998 to 2005. Hospital Referral Region (HRR) was assigned according to patient zip
code. The authors calculated the proportion of women in each HRR who underwent cancer-directed surgery. With
HRR as the predictor of interest, mortality and the receipt of cancer-directed surgery were described in multivariate
analyses. RESULTS: Among 4589 women with ovarian cancer, 3286 underwent cancer-directed surgery. The receipt
of cancer-directed surgery varied by HRR (range, 53%-88%). Women were less likely to undergo cancer-directed surgery if they were older, nonwhite, had higher stage disease, or had more comorbidities. For example, white women
were more likely to undergo such surgery (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.82) compared with all nonwhite women. HRR was a significant predictor of cancer-directed surgery (P ¼.01). A significant correlation was
observed between HRR and all-cause mortality (P ¼.02); however, after adjusting for cancer-directed surgery, that
correlation was no longer significant (P ¼.10). CONCLUSIONS: There was regional variation in mortality among Medicare recipients with ovarian cancer, and access to cancer-directed surgery explained some of that variation. Improving access to high-quality cancer surgery for ovarian cancer may improve outcomes, particularly for minorities and

KEYWORDS: ovarian cancer, disparities, regional variation, epidemiology, chemotherapy.

Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cause of death from malignancies among US women, with 21,650 new

cases and 15,520 deaths expected in 2008.1 The majority of women (67%-69%) are diagnosed with late-stage disease.2
Although disease stage at diagnosis is the most important predictor of survival in ovarian cancer, even women with
advanced disease can benefit from surgery.2 Initial management of ovarian cancer includes appropriate surgery for accurate staging and optimal cytoreduction (ie, debulking).3 There is evidence of variation in treatment for ovarian cancer, specifically, older women with late-stage disease are less likely to receive recommended surgery and chemotherapy.4,5
Appropriate surgical treatment6 occurs more commonly if the treating physician is a gynecologic oncologist as opposed to
a general gynecologist or a general surgeon.7-11 In an analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)Corresponding author: Kathleen M. Fairfield, MD, DrPH, Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Maine Medical Center, 22 Bramhall Street, Portland, ME

Ovarian Cancer Treatment Variation/Fairfield et al

Medicare data by Earle et al, treatment by a gynecologic
oncologist improved overall survival, and the availability
of gynecologic oncologists was the strongest predictor of
receiving care by this type of specialist.11
Geographic variation in the delivery of health services is an important factor in understanding the use of,
quality, disparities in, and access to care for a variety of
healthcare services.12-14 Earlier studies reported geographic variation in cancer screening, surveillance, and
treatment for selected cancers. To our knowledge, there
no studies to date have assessed geographic variation in
the treatment of ovarian cancer. In this analysis, we
describe regional variation in the receipt of cancerdirected surgery and chemotherapy for ovarian cancer in
the Medicare population as well as regional variations in
all-cause mortality and disease-specific mortality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
Data for this analysis came from the linkage of individuals
in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) registries with their healthcare claims reported to
the Medicare program. The population-based registries
that have participated in the SEER Program represent
defined geographic areas and have changed over time.
The registries that we included in the current analysis
range from 14% of the US population (1998-2000) to
26% of the US population (2001-2005).15 An estimated
97% of incident cancer cases are captured in the SEER
regions,16 which are representative of the US population.17 For each reported malignancy, the SEER registries
collect data on age at diagnosis, sex, race and ethnicity,
stage, histologic type, month and year of diagnosis,
whether cancer-directed surgery was completed, and the
date and cause of death. SEER registrars receive training
and follow detailed manuals for tumor reporting (available at: http://seer.cancer.gov/registrars/ accessed October
13, 2009). Sociodemographic data from the 2000 census
are linked with the cases at the census level.
The Medicare data include claims for inpatient and
outpatient care, physician services, and laboratory testing,
among others. SEER and Medicare data are linked periodically for research purposes to ascertain treatment and
outcomes not captured by SEER, and the data have a
match rate of 94%.18 The linked dataset for the current
analysis included claims from January 1, 1998 through
December 31, 2005.
Approval was obtained from the Human Subjects
Committee at Maine Medical Center for the current data

analysis. Because the SEER-Medicare data are deidentified and are based on registry data, it is not possible to
seek informed consent from each participant; therefore,
we requested a waiver of consent. Because we required the
use of each patient’s zip code for this study, we obtained
permission from each of the SEER cancer registrars
involved before we were given access to the data. No other
patient identifiers were included with the data.
Cohort Definition
The study patients included women in the SEER-Medicare data who were diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer at age 65 years between 1998 and 2002 (inclusive)
while living in a SEER area. To identify comorbidities
that were present before diagnosis, women in the cohort
had to have been enrolled in Medicare at least 6 months
before diagnosis. We excluded women who had a history
of prior malignancy, had borderline ovarian cancer pathology, had disease that was not pathologically confirmed, or were diagnosed on death certificate or autopsy
only. We examined frequencies of borderline pathology
type and did not observe any differences according to geographic region. All histologic subtypes of epithelial
tumors (after excluding borderline tumors) were considered together in this analysis of registry data. Women
were included in the analysis if they were eligible for both
Medicare Part A and Part B and if they were not enrolled
in a health maintenance organization at diagnosis for the
entire follow-up period. Patients were followed to ascertain outcomes from their claims using data through 2005
(Fig. 1).
Definitions of Explanatory Variables
Geographic areas

To assess geographic variation, we used the Hospital
Referral Regions (HRRs) and Hospital Service Areas
(HSAs) as defined by Wennberg and Cooper in the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care.19 HRRs represent markets for
tertiary medical care, whereas HSAs represent local markets for community-based inpatient care. HSAs are
assigned to an HRR based on where the majority of
patients within an HSA went for major cardiovascular
procedures. On the basis of these original definitions,
there were 3436 HSAs and 306 HRRs in the United
States. The details of definitions and development of these
regions (based on acute care hospitalizations of the Medicare population in 1992 and 1993) are described in detail
in the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. They have been
used by health services researchers for over a decade to

describe regional variation in the use of a variety of care
processes.
Women who were included in our analysis were
assigned to 1 of 74 HRRs based on the patient’s zip code
of residence at the time of diagnosis. We do not have all
306 HRRs, because the SEER Program is limited to specific states and because we suppressed data for HRRs if
there were not at least 10 ovarian cancer cases. Each HRR
was converted to a dummy variable. Salt Lake City, Utah
was used as the referent HRR, because we observed that
women with epithelial ovarian cancer in this area had the
median survival for the women in our cohort after
diagnosis.
Patient characteristics

Sociodemographic variables that were included in
the current analysis were patient age and race, which we
defined as white or nonwhite based on SEER data. Disease stage using the American Joint Committee on Cancer

4842

(AJCC) classification was obtained from the SEER record
for each patient. Comorbidities were ascertained using
inpatient and physician visit claims for diagnostic billing
codes20 during the 6 months before the cancer diagnosis
using the implementation described by Deyo et al21 of the
Charlson comorbidity score.22 Each patient’s state/county
of residence was mapped, and the map was used to identify whether the woman resided in an urban or rural location.23 In addition to individual-level variables, we used
census data for the median household income within the
zip code of the patient’s residence as a proxy to measure
the patient’s economic status. Population density of obstetrician/gynecologists by HRR was obtained from the
1996 Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care and was explored as
an additional explanatory variable in some analyses.
Surgical care

We defined cancer-directed surgery as resection of
the primary tumor (with or without hysterectomy and/or

debulking). Surgeries were identified by reviewing Medicare claims for inpatient services (Medicare Provider Analysis and Review [MEDPAR]), physician bills, and
outpatient services. We searched claims for 90 days before
the SEER diagnosis date and 365 days after that date for
evidence of surgery. Relevant International Classification
of Diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification (ICD-9CM) codes and American Medical Association Current
Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for initial and subsequent ovarian cancer surgeries, treatments, and outcomes were assessed as they developed by an expert panel
of gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists, as described
in the text and appendices of an article by Earle et al.11
Analyses of 30-day surgical mortality were based on the
date of cancer-directed surgery from the claims. An additional variable from SEER indicating why cancer-directed
surgery was not performed (including categories for not
recommending surgery and patient refusal) was used to
consider patients who never underwent cancer-directed
surgery. We used a variable from the Physician/Supplier
file that indicated the specialty of the treating physician to
identify whether patients who did not undergo surgery
ever were seen by a gynecologic oncologist, gynecologist,
or general surgeon.
Chemotherapy

By using the same claims files described above to ascertain surgery, we reviewed claims for evidence of chemotherapy administration in the 6 months after diagnosis.
We used the ICD-9 procedure code 99.25; ICD-0 diagnosis codes V58.1, V66.2, and V67.2 in MEDPAR; CPT
codes 96, 400 through 496, and 549; and Hospital Common Procedure Coding System codes J9000 through
J9999 and Q0083 through Q0085 in the Physician/Supplier and Outpatient files.
Outcomes
Receipt of cancer-directed surgery and chemotherapy
were the outcomes of interest in our analyses of variation
in treatment according to geographic region. In analyses
of mortality, we were interested primarily in overall and
cancer-specific mortality. Overall survival was calculated
from the 15th of the month of diagnosis to the date of
death from any cause (SEER collects only month and year
of diagnosis). Patients were censored if they were alive at
their last available Medicare coverage month. For analyses
of disease-specific mortality, SEER data were used to
determine cause of death and to assign patients to death
from ovarian cancer or from other conditions. We also

assessed 30-day surgical mortality for the women who
underwent cancer-directed surgery.
Statistical Analysis
We used logistic regression to perform analyses for receipt
of cancer-directed surgery and chemotherapy. We
adjusted first for clinical factors like age, stage at diagnosis,
and comorbidity score (Model 1). Then, we added demographic characteristics to the model, including race,
income, and education (according to the census tract for
patient residence) (Model 2). Finally, we added indicators
for each HRR to the model (Model 3). To obtain a P
value for HRR effect, we compared the 2 log-likelihood
for a full model without HRR included to a model with

HRR added and used a chi-square test with 73 degrees of
freedom (the number of HRR indicator variables minus
1). In additional models (without HRR in the model), we
separately explored SEER registry area and a variable indicating urban versus rural area of residence. In addition, we
evaluated the population density of obstetrician/gynecologists by HRR in the model and again without HRR in the
model.
We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the associations between HRR and all-cause mortality
and between HRR and disease-specific mortality. In these
models, we adjusted for age, cancer stage, comorbidity,
race, income, and education, as in the models described
above. Indicator variables for HRR of residence were
added to fully adjusted models. Also as in the models
described above, the HRR indicating Salt Lake City, Utah
was used as the referent HRR.

RESULTS
Among 4589 women who were eligible for analyses of
mortality, 3286 women (71.6%) underwent cancerdirected surgery (Fig. 1), and 2976 women (64.8%)
received chemotherapy. Nearly 30% of women (1370 of

4844

4589) were aged 80 years, and most women (4083 of
4589; 89%) were white (Table 1). Seventy-five percent of
the women had stage III or IV disease at presentation.
Figure 2 describes variation in cancer-directed surgery for ovarian cancer across the HRRs assigned to SEER
areas. Such surgery varied from 53% to 88% (see Fig. 2)
across HRRs. Among the 1303 women who did not
undergo cancer-directed surgery, 866 women had a least 1
visit with a surgeon (general surgery, gynecology, or gynecologic oncology). For 758 of the 1303 women (58.2%)
who did not undergo such surgery, it was not recommended (as reported to the SEER registrars). An additional 62 women had surgery recommended to them but
declined.
Multivariate analyses of cancer-directed surgery
(Table 2) indicated that the most elderly women (aged
80 years) were least likely to undergo such surgery (odds
ratio [OR], 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.130.20) compared with women ages 65 to 69 years. Women
with stage IV cancers were much less likely (OR, 0.12;
95% CI, 0.09-0.16), and whites were more likely (OR,
1.41; 95% CI, 1.10-1.82) to undergo such surgery. Demographic variables (income and education by census
tract) were not strongly associated with undergoing

cancer-directed surgery, nor was the percentage of nonEnglish speakers according to census tract data (results
not shown). In fully adjusted models, HRR was a significant predictor of undergoing cancer-directed surgery
(P ¼ .01). Models examining SEER registry and rurality
of area of residence as predictors (without HRR in the
model) did not reveal strong or consistent associations. In
addition, we did not observe an association between population density of obstetrician/gynecologists and receipt
of cancer-directed surgery.
Chemotherapy use for ovarian cancer also varied
across HRRs within the SEER areas, from 48% to 93%
(Fig. 3). Analyses predicting the receipt of chemotherapy
(results not shown) revealed similarly that the most elderly
women were least likely to receive chemotherapy as were
nonwhites, women with more comorbidities, and women

with stage IV cancers. HRR was not statistically significant as a predictor of receiving chemotherapy in fully
adjusted models (P ¼ .29). It is noteworthy that stage I
was used as the reference category for disease stage, and
these women would not necessarily be expected to receive
chemotherapy; however, 293 of 598 women (49%) with
stage I disease did receive chemotherapy.
In Cox proportional hazards models of all-cause
mortality, we also observed higher mortality among the
most elderly women, those with advanced-stage disease
and more comorbidities, and nonwhites. HRR in the fully
adjusted model was a significant predictor of all-cause
mortality (P ¼ .02). However, when we added cancerdirected surgery to the model, HRR no longer was statistically significant (P ¼ .10). In analyses of disease-specific
mortality, we observed similar patterns, although they

were attenuated given the smaller number of outcomes
(specifically, deaths from ovarian cancer). Figure 3 illustrates variation in the percentage of women who died
within 2 years according to HRR, which ranged from
27% to 65%.

DISCUSSION
There has been little published information on regional
variation in treatment for ovarian cancer. National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend that
physicians consider cancer-directed surgery for all women
with ovarian cancer, regardless of stage.3 We observed
that there was significant variation in the use of cancerdirected surgery between HRRs. This variation in surgical
rates persisted even after fully adjusting our models for
clinical and sociodemographic factors. The areas with the
lowest rates of cancer-directed surgery, as illustrated in
Figure 2, tended to be in more remote locations. If
women are not being offered surgical referral after diagnosis in some regions of the United States, then they cannot
realize the benefit of such surgery.
Our current findings related to chemotherapy were
in contrast to our findings related to cancer-directed surgery. Although there was considerable observed variation

4846

by HRR in the receipt of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, this variation no longer was important after the models were adjusted for clinical and sociodemographic
factors. Our findings with regard to chemotherapy were
similar to those from another analysis that used SEERMedicare data (through 2001) to demonstrate variation
in the use of chemotherapy for women with ovarian cancer in the Medicare population.24 In that earlier study, the
authors noted that clinical characteristics (stage at diagnosis, age, and comorbidities) were much more important
than HRR in explaining chemotherapy use. However,
those authors did report a range from 33% to 67% in the
proportion of women who received chemotherapy across
hospital referral regions in their analysis. We observed a
similarly broad range for the receipt of chemotherapy
across HRR, although the percentage of women who
received chemotherapy, 48% to 93%, was much higher
than that reported in the earlier study. These findings
likely reflect the increased use of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer over the past several years. Modest observed
differences in all-cause mortality and 2-year mortality
according to HRR in our study no longer were important
after adjusting for the receipt of cancer-directed surgery.
The current analysis has several limitations. The use
of claims to determine comorbidities is likely to result in

under ascertainment. However, this would not be
expected to differ according to geographic region. Because
we relied on claims data, we may have missed relevant
clinical data that also would explain some of the variation
in cancer-directed surgery across HRRs. Some women
may have been offered appropriate surgical treatment but
declined such therapy in favor of supportive care only,
particularly those who may be deemed poor surgical candidates. We did not have access to information on the
density of gynecologic oncologists in the HRRs to further
refine our analysis of care by physician availability. We
cannot comment on women who received their care in
health maintenance organizations, who may have had different access to care than women in fee-for-service Medicare populations. We relied on local pathologist reports
from the treating facilities for accurate pathology data,
which, in turn, are collected by SEER registrars. Because
it may be difficult to establish borderline pathology in
ovarian cancer, the inclusion of a small number of borderline tumors in the analysis may have occurred inadvertently. However, we did not observe any evidence of
variation in the proportion of tumors with borderline pathology by HRR (and borderline tumors were excluded in
our analysis), so any misclassification of pathology would
not be expected to affect our results. Finally, we cannot
comment on the entire Medicare population, because we
were limited to women residing within the SEER areas,
although the SEER areas represent a large portion of the
US population. It is noteworthy that an analysis of a
nationally representative sample of women with ovarian
cancer in the Medicare population would be limited by a
lack of staging information, which is a particular strength
of the SEER data.
The current study demonstrates that variation in the
receipt of cancer-directed surgery and chemotherapy for
ovarian cancer is present among women in the Medicare
population living within SEER areas and that differences
in surgical rates explain much of the observed variation in
outcomes. Because surgery is centrally important in staging and care for these patients, this variation points to substantial room for improvement. Similarly, because
chemotherapy also is an important part of therapy for
women with stage III and IV ovarian cancer, our findings
suggest opportunities for improvement. Even among
older women and women with comorbidities, in almost
all cases, chemotherapy can be tailored effectively to the
individual patient. Women and their providers need to be
aware that cancer-directed surgery is important across all
stages and that chemotherapy it is an option for patients

with stage III and IV cancers. Providers should make
appropriate referrals to gynecologic oncologists if this specialized care is not available locally.
