ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous plasma cell malignancy and remains
incurable. B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) protein correlates with the survival and the drug
resistance of myeloma cells. BH3 mimetics have been developed to disrupt the binding
between BCL2 and its pro-apoptotic BCL2 family partners for the treatment of MM, but
with limited therapeutic efficacy. We recently identified a small molecule BDA-366 as a
BCL2 BH4 domain antagonist, converting it from an anti-apoptotic into a pro-apoptotic
molecule. In this study, we demonstrated that BDA-366 induces robust apoptosis in
MM cell lines and primary MM cells by inducing BCL2 conformational change. Delivery
of BDA-366 substantially suppressed the growth of human MM xenografts in NODscid/IL2Rgnull mice, without significant cytotoxic effects on normal hematopoietic cells
or body weight. Thus, BDA-366 functions as a novel BH4-based BCL2 inhibitor and
offers an entirely new tool for MM therapy.

cancer cells including malignant plasma cell lines [10–12],
and is related to cancer cell survival, early disease relapse
and drug resistance [13–16]. As a survival factor, BCL2
protein contains four conserved domains: BCL2 homology
1 (BH1), BH2, BH3, and BH4, and a transmembrane
domain that anchors the molecules in the mitochondria
and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes [17]. BH1,
BH2 and BH3 domains together form a hydrophobic
pocket with the BH3 domain buried inside (the BH3binding pocket). This pocket facilitates protein-protein
binding between BCL2 and the BH3 domain of proapoptotic BCL2 family members such as BIM (Bcl-2like protein 11), BAX (BCL2-associated X protein) and
BAK (BCL2 homologous antagonist killer), preventing
BAX / BAK activation and consequent apoptosis through
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP)
[18]. A panel of BH3 mimetics including ABT-737, ABT263, ABT-199, AT-101, GX15-070 have been developed
to disrupt the binding between BCL2 and pro-apoptotic
BCL2 family members, and to block the anti-apoptosis

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common malignancy
characterized by excessive proliferation of abnormal
clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). In
recent years, substantial progress has been made in the
development of effective therapeutic approaches to treat
MM, including autologous and allogeneic stem cell
transplants, monoclonal antibodies, proteasome inhibitors,
immunomodulatory drugs and recent chimeric antigen
receptor-expressing T cells [1–7]. These approaches have
significantly improved clinical outcomes and prolonged
patient survival. However, due to the high phenotypic
heterogeneity and plasticity of MM cells [8], none of
these agents is curative, and the disease eventually
relapses and becomes refractory to treatment [9]. Thus, the
development of innovative therapeutics that can advance
the field toward the cure of MM is very attractive.

function of the BCL2 molecule [19–22]. BH3-based BCL2
inhibitors are currently being evaluated in different phases
of clinical trials [23, 24].
The N-terminal amphipathic helix BH4 domain
(aa6-31) of BCL2 is known as a survival domain and is
essential for the anti-apoptotic function of BCL2 protein
[25, 26]. Removal of the BH4 domain by caspaseactivated cleavage or genetic mutation converts BCL2
from an anti-apoptotic molecule into a death effector [27].
The BCL2 BH4 domain has been shown to directly bind
and inhibit inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R)
[28], which serve as the main intracellular Ca2+-release
channel of the ER [29], a decoy peptide binding the BH4
domain by blocking the interaction between BCL2 and
IP3R induces Ca2+-mediated apoptosis in MM cells [30].
We recently identified a small molecule, BDA-366, which
is a member of the anthraquinone (1,4-diamino-9,10anthraquinone) class, as a selective BCL2 BH4 antagonist.
BDA-366 induces a conformational change in the BCL2
molecule that converts it to a death protein, and inhibits
lung cancer growth in vitro and in vivo [31, 32]. In this
study, we report that BDA-366 has potent anti-myeloma
activity, inducing robust apoptotic death of MM cells in
vitro and suppressing the growth of human MM cells in
vivo.

groups showed an increase in absolute live cell number
of more than 4-fold (RPMI8226, Figure 1E) and 3-fold
(U266, Figure 1F) after 48-hour culture.

BDA-366 induces conformational change and
reduces the phosphorylation of BCL-2
To examine whether BDA-366 induces BCL2
conformational change by exposure of the BCL2 BH3
domain in MM cells, we treated human RPMI8226 and
U266 cells with BDA-366 at concentrations of 0.25
and 0.5μM, and stained the cells with anti-BCL2 BH3
domain specific antibody [31]. Flow cytometry assay
demonstrated that BDA-366 treatment indeed induced
the conformational change in BCL2 molecule that
promotes the exposure of its BCL2 BH3 domain with
significantly higher anti-BH3 fluorescence intensity
in the treated RPMI8226 (Figure 2A–2B) and U266
(Figure 2C–2D) cells. It was previously demonstrated
that phosphorylation of BCL2 at Ser70 is required to
stabilize the anti-apoptotic activity of BCL2 and its
function as a pro-survival molecule [33–35]. To examine
whether BDA-366-induced BCL2 conformational change
reduces BCL2 phosphorylation, we performed a Western
blot on BDA-366-treated MM cells with an anti-pBCL2
(Ser70) specific antibody [31]. Western blotting showed
that both RPMI8226 and U266 cells have a high baseline
level of BCL2 phosphorylation (Figure 3). After BDA366 treatments at concentration of 0.25 and 0.5μM,
phosphorylation of BCL2 significantly decreased in both
RPMI8226 (Figure 3A–3B) and U266 (Figure 3C–3D)
cells, coincident with BDA-366-induced exposure of the
BCL2 BH3 domain in the treated myeloma cells (Figure
2B and 2D).

RESULTS
BDA-366 suppresses human myeloma cell
growth in vitro
BDA-366 is a small molecule antagonist that
specifically binds the BCL2 BH4 domain, and has the
ability to convert anti-apoptotic BCL2 into a pro-apoptotic
death molecule [31]. To test the effect of the BH4
antagonist on myeloma cell growth, we treated human
MM RPMI8226 and U266 cell lines with increasing
concentrations of BDA-366 (Figure 1A) for 48 hours.
FACS analyses of the treated MM cells showed that BDA366 induced robust apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner
in both RPMI8226 (Figure 1B and 1C) and U266 cells
(Figure 1B and 1D). The percentages of apoptotic cells
in RPMI8226 and U266 cell lines treated with 0.5μM of
BDA-366 were 84.2% and 60.6% on average, respectively
(Figure 1B), which were significantly higher than in cells
treated with lower concentrations (i.e. 0.1μM or 0.25μM),
or with DMSO control (Figure 1B). DMSO treatment had
little apoptotic effect on the two cell lines (Figure 1B).
Consequently, BDA-366 treatment markedly reduced
the absolute live cell number in both RPMI8226 (Figure
1E) and U266 (Figure 1F) cell lines after 48-hour culture
in comparison with DMSO control, with only 0.1 fold
(RPMI8226, Figure 1E) and 0.5 fold (U266, Figure 1F)
of the initial live cell numbers remaining in the groups
treated with 0.5μM BDA-366. In contrast, DMSO treated

BDA-366 induces apoptosis in human primary
myeloma cells
To test the effect of the small molecule BDA-366
as a BCL2 BH4 antagonist on the apoptosis of primary
myeloma cells, we treated the whole bone marrow (BM)
cells harvested from myeloma patients with BDA-366.
The patients were either untreated or had relapsed/
refractory disease, with varying genetic backgrounds
(Table 1). Primary myeloma cells were gated on the
CD45-CD38+CD138+ population. FACS analyses of the
treated BM cells demonstrated that BDA-366 treatment
at concentrations of both 0.25 and 0.5 μM robustly
induced the apoptosis of primary myeloma cells within
a 24-hour culture period (Figure 4A), with 32.4% and
63.4% apoptotic cells on average respectively (Figure
4B). In control primary myeloma cells without BDA-366
treatment, there was a baseline level of 4.7% apoptotic
cells. In non-MM cells, BDA-366 treatment did not cause
significant apoptotic death in comparison with control
treatment with DMSO (Figure 4C–4D). To examine

conformational change by exposure of the BH3 domain
in primary myeloma cells, we stained BDA-366-treated
BM MM cells with anti-BCL2 BH3 domain-specific
antibodies. FACS analysis of CD45-CD38+CD138+ cells
showed that BDA-366 treatment at concentrations of 0.25

in primary myeloma cells from patients, and caused the

Measurement of myeloma tumors showed that delivery
of BDA-366 into the mice significantly inhibited both
RPMI8226 (Figure 6B) and U266 (Figure 6C) myeloma
cell growth in vivo. Control DMSO treatment had no
effect on the tumor growth (Figure 6B–6C). In parallel, we
also assessed the cytotoxicity of BDA-366 in naive NSG
mice following 5 treatment doses. Monitoring mouse body
weight showed that BDA-366 treatment had no significant
toxic side effects in the mice; the three groups of mice
treated with the antagonist, DMSO, or no treatment had
similar weights on day 23 (Figure 6D). Peripheral blood
cell counts demonstrated that there were similar levels
of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets in the
blood collected from the three groups of mice (Figure 6E),
confirming that BDA-366 treatment had no significant
toxic side effects on the murine hematopoietic system at a
therapeutic dose.

myeloma cell growth in vivo
To test whether the efficacy of BDA-366 in the
suppression of human MM cell growth in vivo reflects that
seen in vitro, we implanted RPMI8226 or U266 myeloma
cells into NSG mice, and treated the mice with BDA-366
at a dose of 10mg per kg mouse weight by intraperitoneal

DISCUSSION

BCL2 and BIM, BAX and BAK. Utilizing BDA-366 as a
BH4-based BCL2 inhibitor to treat MM is distinct from
this BH3 mimetics strategy, since BDA-366 not only
blocks the activities of the BH4 domain, but also changes
the conformation of BCL2 in the hydrophobic groove.
During BCL2 conformational change, the hydrophobic
pocket undergoes a large-scale realignment, causing the
exposure of the BH3 domain [36], which can be detected
by a BCL2 BH3-specific antibody [31]. Indeed, using
anti-BCL2 BH3-specific antibodies, we were able to

In this study, we demonstrate that the non-peptidic
small molecule BDA-366 functions as a novel BCL2
inhibitor and effectively induces robust apoptotic death
of human MM cells. To our knowledge, this is the first
report that BH4 antagonist-induced BCL2 conformational
change leads to the suppression of MM growth.
The mechanistic action of current BH3 mimetics for
cancer therapy is designed to block the binding between

show this conformational change in BCL2 in MM cells
treated with BDA-366, confirming the induction of BCL2
conformational change by the BH4 antagonist.
BCL2 phosphorylation at Ser70 promotes tumor cell
survival [33, 35]. In this study, we found that BDA-366
treatment significantly reduced BCL2 phosphorylation
at Ser70, indicating an additional mechanistic effect of
BDA-366 on BCL2. BDA-366 was previously shown to
disrupt the noncanonical BCL2-BH4-BAX interaction,
inhibit the binding of BCL2 with IP3R and enhance Ca2+
release and apoptosis in tumor cells [31]. BCL2 BH4
domain also binds to calcineurin, CED-4, HIF-1α, c-Myc,
paxillin, Raf-1, Ras and VDAC, promoting tumorigenesis
or tumor survival and contributing to both anti-apoptosis
and pro-tumorgenesis activities of BCL2 [37]. BDA-366induced suppression of MM growth may also result from
the inhibition of those functions of the BH4 domain.
MM is considered a heterogeneous disease in terms
of malignant plasma cell subclones and its sensitivity to
inhibition by anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins [38].
Using a BH3-profiling method [39], RPMI8226 cells were
shown to be sensitive to the BCL2 inhibitor ABT-737 (a
BCL2 BH3 mimetic), but insensitive to ABT-199, while
U266 cells were resistant to the BH3 mimetics, since ABT737 treatment had no significant suppressive effect on U266
cells [38]. In this study, we observed that RPMI8226 cells
were very sensitive to BDA-366 treatment in cell culture.
However, we also found that BDA-366 treatment potently
induced apoptosis in U266 cells, suggesting that the BH4
antagonist employs distinct actions in malignant plasma
cells compared to the BH3-based mimetics such as ABT737 and ABT-199. BDA-366-induced robust apoptosis in
primary myeloma cells from untreated patients or patients
with relapsed/refractory myeloma with varying genetic
background further indicates that BDA-366 as a novel
BCL2 BH4 antagonist possesses potent therapeutic effect
for relapsed/refractory myeloma. We also evaluated the
anti-MM effect of BDA-366 in NSG immune deficient mice
xenografted with RPMI8226 or U266 cells. Consistent with
our in vitro results, BDA-366 treatment for 8 days efficiently
suppressed human MM growth in the mice. Analyses of
cytotoxicity of BDA-366 revealed that the BH4 antagonist
had minimal side effects in terms of both body weight and
the hematopoietic cellular system in NSG mice. Collectively,
our data demonstrate that BDA-366, as a novel BH4-based
BCL2 inhibitor and an inducer of BCL2 conformational
change could offer an entirely new tool for MM therapy.

Cell culture
Human myeloma cell lines RPMI8226 and U266
(obtained from the American Type Culture Collection)
were cultured and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
(Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, USA) and penicillin /
streptomycin antibiotics at 37oC in a 5% CO2 incubator.
For cell apoptosis assay, U266 or 8226 cells (10,000
cells/well) were cultured in 96-well plates with 200ul/
well of RPMI-1640 medium in the presence of different
concentrations of BDA-366 (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5μM) for 48
hours.

Patient sample processing
BM aspirates from patients with MM (n=5)
(Table  1) were diluted to 20ml with 1× PBS, and
processed as previously described [38]. White blood cells
in the marrow were isolated with lymphocyte separation
medium (Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA), and cultured
(106 cells/ml) in complete RPMI medium supplemented
with BDA-366 (0, 0.25, 0.5μM) for 24 hours. Informed
consent was obtained from all human subjects. The use of
human samples was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Emory University.

Western blot
RPMI8226 or U266 cells (106/ml) were harvested 8
hours after BDA-366 treatment (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5μM), and
washed with cold PBS. Total proteins were extracted from
the cells lysed with protein lysate buffer supplemented
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as previously
described [40]. The proteins were separated on 10% SDS
polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, USA).
The membranes were treated with rabbit anti-pBCL2
(Ser70), BCL2 (1:100), and anti-β-actin antibodies
(1:1000 dilution) (Cell Signaling Technology, USA); then
incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
before being subjected to enhanced chemiluminescent
