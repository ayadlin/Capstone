ABSTRACT
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widely used industrial plasticizer, which is ubiquitously
present in the environment and organisms. As an endocrine disruptor, BPA has caused
significant concerns regarding its interference with reproductive function. However,
little is known about the impact of BPA exposure on early testicular development. The
aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of neonatal BPA exposure on
the first wave of spermatogenesis. Newborn male mice were subcutaneously injected
with BPA (0.01, 0.1 and 5 mg/kg body weight) daily from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 21.
Histological analysis of testes at PND 22 revealed that BPA-treated testes contained
mostly spermatogonia and spermatocytes with markedly less round spermatids,
indicating signs of meiotic arrest. Terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay
showed that BPA treatment significantly increased the number of apoptotic germ cells
per tubule, which corroborated the observation of meiotic arrest. In addition, BPA
caused abnormal proliferation of germ cells as revealed by Proliferating Cell Nuclear
Antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemical staining. Mechanistically, BPA-treated testes
displayed a complete lack of BOULE expression, which is a conserved key regulator for
spermatogenesis. Moreover, BPA significantly increased the expression of estrogen
receptor (ER) α and β in the developing testis. The present study demonstrated
that neonatal BPA exposure disrupted meiosis progression during the first wave of
spermatogenesis, which may be, at least in part, due to inhibition of BOULE expression
and/or up-regulation of ERα/β expression in BPA-exposed developing testis.

INTRODUCTION

Exposure to BPA during early developmental stage
was speculated to affect testicular development and
spermatogenesis [7–10]. Some reports documented that
ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mice implanted with
a tube filled with BPA (BPA was released at 60 μg/day)
throughout pregnancy and lactation significantly lowered
the percentage of seminiferous tubules with elongated
spermatids in the testis of male offspring at age of 4 weeks
[11]. Neonatal administration of a low dose (10 μg/ kg)
of BPA in both mouse and rat was demonstrated to
cause deforming of the acrosomal granule and nucleus
in step 2–3 spermatids [12]. However, there is still a

Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disrupting
chemical, is widely used in the manufacture of a
variety of domestic products including plastic food
and water containers, food packaging, water pipes,
baby bottles and toys (http:\\www.bisphenol-a.org). By
2003, over 6 billion pounds of BPA were generated in
the manufacture processes [1]. Consequently, BPA has
been detected in food, water, human urine and blood
samples, placenta and amniotic fluid, as well as breast
milk [2–6].

need for studies, which assess the influence of BPA
on spermatogenesis and testis development utilizing
a dose range that spans from microgram to milligram
per kilogram body weight. Particularly, a dose of
10 microgram per kilogram body weight is necessary for a
neonatal exposure model as it correlates with human infant
environmental exposure to BPA [13].
Recently, BPA exposure at an environmentally
relevant dose was shown to induce meiotic abnormalities
in adult male rats [14]. But the underlying mechanisms
remain unknown. Boule, a member of the DAZ (Deleted
in AZoospermia) family of genes, was reported to
exhibit a male predominant expression pattern and to be
required for spermatogenesis. In Drosophila, male Boule
mutants are sterile, and their germ cells are arrested at the
spermatocyte stage [15]. Boule homozygous mutant mice
are also sterile with meiotic arrest at the round spermatid
stage [16]. The lack of BOULE expression has also been
associated with meiotic arrest during spermatogenesis in
infertile male patients [17, 18]. Together, multiple lines
of evidence indicate a conserved function of Boule in
regulating spermatogenesis across species.
Moreover, a number of studies utilizing in vivo
and/or in vitro systems showed that BPA interacted with
estrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ [19–21]. Izzotti A
et al. found that BPA up-regulated ERβ in mouse
mammary tissue [20]. Tabuchi et al. reported that BPA
down-regulated ERα in an in vitro Sertoli cell model [19].
BPA has been shown to exert dual actions as either agonist
or antagonist for ERα and/or ERβ in a cell type- and/or
tissue type-specific manner [19, 22, 23]. Furthermore,
the mode of action of BPA may also depend on the ER
subtypes [24].
In the present study, we chose a high dose of BPA
(5 mg/kg) equal to the No Observed Adverse Effect
Level (NOAEL) (FAO/WHO 2008), a middle dose
(0.1 mg/kg) and a low dose (0.01 mg/kg) below the
tolerable daily intake levels of BPA (0.05 mg/kg)
announced by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA,
2006) and the US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA, 1993). In the present report, male neonatal mice
were injected subcutaneously from postnatal day (PND)
1 to 21 with BPA (0.01, 0.1 and 5 mg/kg), and the
testes were harvested at PND 22 for investigation of the
effects of neonatal BPA exposure on the first wave of
spermatogenesis. Within these testes levels of apoptosis
and proliferation were assessed. Testicular expression of
Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), ERα, ERβ,
and BOULE were examined to elucidate the potential
mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of BPA on
spermatogenesis.

RESULTS
Testis histology was damaged by BPA exposure
Histological examination revealed that the structure
of the seminiferous tubule was damaged by BPA exposure
during early development. In the vehicle-treated group,
germ cells (including spermatogonia, spermatocytes and
round spermatids) in seminiferous tubules were wellorganized with abundant cytoplasm and nuclei (Figure
1A1, 1A2). However, in BPA-treated groups, very few
round spermatids were found in the seminiferous tubules,
indicating spermatogenic arrest at the spermatocyte level
(p < 0.01, Figure 1B–1F). Furthermore, we found
significantly more desquamated cells and chromosome
fragments in the center of seminiferous tubules in BPAtreated groups (Figure 1B–1C). Interestingly, most
desquamated cells were seen in the 0.1 mg/kg group (Figure
1C1, 1C2). At the highest dosing level, seminiferous tubule
lumen appeared vacant, indicating a significant loss of
developing germ cells (Figure 1D1, 1D2).

BPA exposure induced germ cell apoptosis
BPA exposure increased the number of Terminal
dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) - positive germ cells in
all dose groups (Figure 2B−2D) compared to control group
(Figure 2A). Average number of TUNEL-positive cell
per tubule significantly increased in BPA-exposed groups
(p < 0.05, p < 0.01, Figure 2E). In addition, mostly
desquamated cells in the centers of the seminiferous
tubules were TUNEL-positive (Figure 2B–2D).

BPA exposure caused abnormal proliferation of
spermatogenic cells
Immunoreactivity for PCNA was observed in the
nuclei of spermatogonia and some spermatocytes in
control group (Figure 3A). The intensity and distribution
pattern of PCNA immunostaining were obviously different
in BPA-treated groups. In BPA-treated testes, there were
more layers of PCNA positive cells in seminiferous tubules
and cells located at the center of many seminiferous
tubules were PCNA positive (Figure 3B–3D),
which were rarely seen in the control testes (Figure 3A).
The PCNA positive staining (revealed by mean optical
density (MOD)) was significantly increased in the BPAtreated groups (p < 0.05, Figure 3E). In addition to
immunohistochemical staining, western blotting also
confirmed that the expression of PCNA was markedly
increased in BPA treatment (p < 0.01, Figure 3F, 3G).
Together, these findings indicate that BPA exposure
caused abnormal proliferation of spermatogenic cells in
the developing testes.

BPA exposure increased testicular ERα and ERβ
expression

the effects of neonatal exposure due to the difficulty of
oral administration. Studies have found the enzyme
that conjugates BPA (UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase) is
expressed at low levels in neonates, and no differences in
pharmacokinetics between oral and non-oral dosing was
reported [28, 29]. Therefore, in the present study, BPA
was administered to male neonatal mice via subcutaneous
injection to investigate whether neonatal BPA exposure
impaired the first wave of spermatogenesis. The first
wave of spermatogenesis begins after birth and is highly
synchronized, therefore, neonatal exposure provides a
convincing model for assessing the impact of chemicals
on meiotic progression [30]. Using this neonatal exposure
model, we found neonatal exposure of BPA caused meiotic
arrest at the stage of spermatocyte during the first wave of
spermatogenesis.
To investigate the molecular mechanisms
underpinning the meiotic arrest in spermatogenesis
induced by BPA, we assessed the expression levels of
BOULE (a key regulator of meiosis) and PCNA (a marker

We also performed Western blot analysis to determine
the expression levels of the estrogen receptors ERα/β
in the testes. In the testes of control group (PND 22),
minimal immunoreactive bands of ERα and ERβ were
detected, but significant increases were observed in ERα
and ERβ expression in the BPA-treated groups (p < 0.01,
Figure 5). The increases in ERα and ERβ expression
levels were not in a dose-dependent manner and the
highest expression was observed in the middle dose group
(0.1 mg/kg) (Figure 5).

DISCUSSION
Neonatal stage is a very critical development period
that is susceptible to chemical exposure [8, 25– 27].
Although there are models to study the impacts of
chemicals in adult animals, it is not easy to identify

ERα and ERβ, the most desquamated cells caused by BPA
exposure, the highest expression of PCNA, and the least
expression of BOULE were all observed in the middle dose
group (0.1 mg/kg), which further indicates the existence of
a nonmonotonic dose-response relationship of BPA. Our
findings are consistent with several in vivo and in vitro
studies, which reported the dose-response curve of BPA is
indeed an inverted-U-shaped curve [35, 36].
ERα and ERβ participate in the control of
proliferation and/or apoptosis of germ cells [37, 38]. In
the present study, the elevated expression levels of ERα
and ERβ likely contributed to the abnormal proliferation
of germ cells as revealed by significantly increased PCNA
expression. Zhang et al. found a marked increase in the
number of germ cells entering meiosis in mice daily treated
with 40 μg/kg BPA for 3 weeks [33]. An in vitro study also
demonstrated that BPA induced spermatogonial cell (GC)1 cell proliferation [35], whereas the BPA exposure was
only maintained 12 h in this experiment and the fate of the
proliferating cells weren’t predicted. It could be that germ
cells were pushed into a state of abnormal proliferation,
which will then trigger apoptosis. In the present study,
we observed associated abnormal proliferation and
elevated apoptosis inside seminiferous tubules of BPAtreated testes. Similarly, Zhang et al. also found a sharp
decrease in the number of germ cells entering meiosis after
treatment with 40 μg/kg BPA for 5 weeks [33].

of cell proliferation) in the testes after BPA exposure.
Interestingly, we found BPA significantly inhibited the
expression of BOULE and increased the expression of
PCNA. Boule is conserved across species, exclusively
expressed in germ cells, and seems to be essential for
completion of spermatogenesis. Lack of BOULE expression
was correlated with meiosis arrest [16, 17, 31]. Boule
ortholog was demonstrated to be important for progression
beyond pachynema of prophase I of meiosis in Drosophila
testes [15]. While VanGompel and Xu reported that
spermatogenic arrest occurred during the round spermatid
stage, prior to elongation in Boule knockout mice [18].
Previous studies found that estrogen receptor
antagonist blocked BPA-induced meiotic disruption,
which implied that estrogen receptor maybe involved in
mediating meiotic arrest [32]. Another study showed that
BPA exposure (0, 20 and 40 μg/kg daily from PND 3 to
PND 35) significantly increased ERα, not ERβ, expression
in testis of mouse [33]. Neonatal mice treated with 20 μg
of BPA for 5 days since birth also resulted in an increase in
the number of ERα-positive cells in the epithelium of the
vas deferens at PND18 after birth, but no significant change
of ERα expression was found in a higher dose (50 μg BPA)
group [34]. In line with the above studies, the induction
we observed was not linear, as the highest induction for
ERα was achieved by the middle dose (0.1 mg/kg) and all
three doses caused similar induction for ERβ. In addition to

collected, either stored at −80°C for further molecular
analyses or immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for hematoxylin and
eosin (H & E) or immunohistochemical staining.

The present study indicated that neonatal BPA
exposure induced meiotic arrest and increased
apoptosis of spermatogenic cells during the first wave
of spermatogenesis. The lack of BOULE expression is
likely to contribute to the observed meiotic arrest. The upregulation of ERα, ERβ and PCNA may be involved in
the abnormal cell division induced by BPA. In addition,
the present study suggests that neonatal exposure could be
considered as a good model to assess the chemical impact
on spermatogenesis.

Morphological analysis of testes using H & E
staining
Paraffin-embedded testes were sectioned on a
microtome into 5 μm-thick sections and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination of
testis morphology. Staining was visualized under a light
microscope and images were captured with a camera
(Leica DFC420, Germany).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and BPA treatment
SPF mus muculus (ICR strain, 10 weeks of age)
were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Co.,
Ltd. (SLAC, China), housed in polypropylene cages and
acclimatized to an environmentally controlled room (room
temperature 24 ± 2°C, relative humidity 40–50%, frequent
ventilation and 12 h light-dark cycle). A commercial
pellet diet (BPA-free, SLAC, China) and drinking water
(in glass bottles) were available ad libitum. The
experimental protocol was in accordance with the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Weifang Medical University.
After delivery, male pups were randomly divided
into four groups (n = 16–20 per group) and subcutaneously
injected daily with BPA (0.01, 0.1, 5 mg/kg, 4 μl/g,
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, dissolved in absolute
ethanol and then diluted in corn oil) or with vehicle
(control group) from PND 1 to 21, with the day of
birth designated as PND 0, as illustrated in Figure 6.
Within 24 h of delivery, female pups were removed and
each dam was left with 4 to 5 male pups. At PND 22, male
offspring were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and testes

TUNEL assay
Paraffin-embedded testis sections were stained
using the in situ apoptosis detection TUNEL kit (Roche,
Switzerland) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Sections were then counter stained with hematoxylin.
Apoptosis (positive TUNEL staining) of testicular cells
was assessed with randomly chosen seminiferous tubules
(100 tubules per mouse).

PCNA and BOULE expression by
immunohistochemistry
Sections (5 μm-thick) were hydrated and
microwaved in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) for antigen
retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase and nonspecific binding
were then blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol and 1.5%
normal goat serum in 0.01 M PBS, respectively. Sections
were incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 4°C
with mouse anti-PCNA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.) or rabbit anti-BOULE polyclonal
antibody (abcam). After washing, sections were incubated

Figure 6: Schematic of animal treatment procedure. The day of parturition was designated as PND 0, and BPA treatment started on
PND 1. BPA was administered subcutaneously at doses of 0.01, 0.1, and 5 mg/kg/day through PND 21. On PND 22, animals were sacrificed
and tissues collected.

were washed and incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase
complex reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for
15 min. This step was followed by another wash with
PBS and subsequent reaction with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine
(DAB) solution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for color
development in the dark. Negative controls were processed
simultaneously by omitting the primary antibody. The
Integral Optical Density (IOD) was quantified with
Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (IPP 6.0) software. The index of MOD
(IOD /area) was used to reflect the expression of PCNA
and BOULE. For each group, 20-30 randomly chosen
fields were analyzed.
