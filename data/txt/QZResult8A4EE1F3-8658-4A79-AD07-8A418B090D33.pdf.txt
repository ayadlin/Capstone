Autophagy Enhanced by Microtubule- and MitochondrionAssociated MAP1S Suppresses Genome Instability and
Hepatocarcinogenesis
Rui Xie, Fen Wang, Wallace L. McKeehan, and Leyuan Liu

Abstract
Dysfunctional autophagy is associated with tumorigenesis; however, the relationship between the two
processes remains unclear. In the present study, we showed that MAP1S levels immediately become elevated
in response to diethylnitrosamine-induced or genome instability-driven metabolic stress in a murine model of
hepatocarcinoma. Upregulation of MAP1S enhanced autophagy to remove aggresomes and dysfunctional
organelles that trigger DNA double-strand breaks and genome instability. The early accumulation of an unstable
genome before signs of tumorigenesis indicated that genome instability caused tumorigenesis. After tumorigenesis, tumor development triggered the activation of autophagy to reduce genome instability in tumor foci. We,
therefore, conclude that an increase in MAP1S levels triggers autophagy to suppress genome instability such that
both the incidence of diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis and malignant progression are suppressed. Taken together, the data establish a link between MAP1S-enhanced autophagy and suppression of
genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Cancer Res; 71(24); 7537–46. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Autophagy, or self-digestion, is a process that begins with
the formation of isolation membranes that engulf substrates
such as aggregated proteins or damaged organelles to form
autophagosomes. During different stages of cell cycle, cells
normally retain robust autophagic activity to remove aggregated proteins or damaged organelles such as mitochondria to
maintain cellular homeostasis (1). Under nutritive stresses,
autophagy is activated to digest cellular organelles or protein
aggregates and recycle the basic components for survival (2).
An overactivated autophagy causes organelle depletion and
type II programmed cell death (3). If the autophagic process is
blocked before the stage of autophagosomal formation, the
fragmented mitochondria will release cytochrome c and other
small molecules to induce conventional apoptosis (4). If autophagosomes are not degraded efﬁciently, accumulated mitochondria may become damaged by their own production of
superoxide and start to leak electrons and will lose their
membrane potentials. Thus, diverse forms of aggregation and
perinuclear clustering of mitochondria are formed and further

induce robust oxidative stress that might also trigger apoptotic
cell death (5). Therefore, autophagy not only promotes survival
but also controls cell death. Although a link between autophagic malfunction and cancer was established (6-11), the
mechanism by which autophagy suppresses tumorigenesis
remains largely unknown (2).
MAP1S was originally described and named the chromosome 19 open reading frame 5 (C19ORF5; refs. 12, 13). It is a
widely distributed homologue of neuronal-speciﬁc MAP1A
and MAP1B (13, 14). Similar to MAP1A/B, full-length MAP1S
(MAP1SFL) gives rise to multiple posttranslationally modiﬁed isoforms, including heavy chain (HC) and light chain
(LC) isoforms. Prolonged mitotic arrest or inhibition of the
26S proteasome causes accumulation of an otherwise highly
labile short chain (SC) of MAP1S (15, 16). In collaboration
with leucine-rich PPR motif-containing protein (LRPPRC)
that associates with mitochondria and interacts with Parkinson disease–related mitophagy initiator Parkin, a tumor
suppressor and microtubular stabilizer RASSF1A, and LC3
that associates with isolation membrane (12, 13, 16, 17),
MAP1S bridges autophagic components with microtubules
and mitochondria to affect autophagosomal biogenesis and
degradation (16). Ablation of the Map1s gene in mice causes
impairment in both basal autophagy for clearance of abnormal mitochondria and nutritive stress–induced autophagy
for nutrient recycling (16). The MAP1SSC associates with
mitochondria in addition to microtubules and causes irreversible aggregation of dysfunctional mitochondria resulting
in mitotic cell death (15). Therefore, the MAP1S-depleted
mice serve as a good model to test the relationship between
autophagy and tumorigenesis.

In this study, we show that in response to the acute increase
of oxidative stress imposed by exposure to a chemical carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN), MAP1S levels in mouse
livers are dramatically elevated to a peak within 1 day and
then decrease to an undetectable level 2 days after exposure.
The acute elevation of MAP1S levels in mouse livers on DEN
exposure leads to activation of autophagy. Activated autophagy leads to removal of p62-associated aggresomes and
dysfunctional mitochondria and reduction of DNA doublestrand breaks (DSB) and genome instability. Because of the
ineffective autophagy machinery in the absence of MAP1S,
the MAP1S-depleted mice accumulate higher levels of the
p62 and g-H2AX–marked genome instability even after the
acute effect of DEN exposure diminishes 2 days later. The
higher levels of genome instability than in wild-type mice
remain in the livers of DEN-treated adult MAP1S-depleted
mice. After tumor foci are detectable in wild-type mice,
MAP1S levels again shift to high levels in tumor foci but
remain undetectable in their adjacent nontumor tissues.
Elevated levels of MAP1S in tumor foci lead to reactivation
of autophagy, further leading to reduction of genomic instability within the tumor foci. Because of higher levels of
genome instability in liver tissues before tumorigenesis and
tumor foci after formation, the MAP1S-depleted mice develop more tumor foci and those benign adenomas are faster to
become more malignant hepatocarcinomas. This is the ﬁrst
report from in vivo studies to show a relationship between
the autophagy-suppressed oxidative stress and genome
instability–driven tumorigenesis from the earliest origin to
the latest stage of tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies
Antibody against MAP1S (4G1) recognizing an epitope
between human MAP1S sequence D667 and S767 was obtained
from A&G Pharmaceutical, Inc. (14, 16). Primary antibodies
against b-actin, phosphorylated-H3, FITC-, and rhodamineconjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibody against p62 (SQSTM1;
rabbit polyclonal, BML-PW9860) was obtained from Enzo Life
Sciences International, Inc. Antibody against g-H2AX (rabbit
polyclonal, A300-081A) was from Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. The
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Bio-Rad. DEN was purchased from SigmaAldrich. The ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System was
procured from GE Healthcare Biosciences.
Analysis of DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice
Wild-type and MAP1S-depleted mice were created as
described (16) and housed in a pathogen-free animal facility
under a standard 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle with ad
libitum water and chow. Animal protocols were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Institute of
Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M Health Science Center. Hepatocarcinogenesis were induced with the hepatocarcinogen DEN as described previously (18). Brieﬂy, cohorts of
male 15-day-old wild-type and MAP1S-depleted littermates

were subjected to a single intraperitoneal administration of
10 mg/g body weight DEN dissolved in saline. Mice were
sacriﬁced with euthanasia techniques at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12
months after birth. Immediately after euthanasia, whole-body
weights were recorded and the livers were excised, weighed,
and photographed. Grossly visible surface liver tumors were
scored from the top and bottom of each liver. Large macroscopic lesions and their adjacent normal tissues were dissected
out. Tissues were either ﬁxed or frozen in liquid nitrogen
immediately and stored at 80 C following standard
protocols.
Immunoblot, immunostaining, and ﬂuorescent confocal
microscopy
Lysates from normal liver tissues or tumor samples were
prepared and immunoblotting was carried out as described
(16). Immunostaining was carried out on 5-mm-thick sections mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Sections were then deparafﬁnized in xylenes and rehydrated
through a graded series of ethanol/water solutions. The
antigens were retrieved by boiling in citrate buffer (10
mmol/L sodium citrate sodium buffer, pH 6.0) for 20 minutes at 100 C or according to instructions by manufacturers
of the antibodies. The speciﬁcally bound antibodies were
detected with ﬂuorescent- or HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody and visualized using the TSA Plus Fluorescence
System. The sections were counterstained with TO-PRO-3
iodide to label nuclei and observed under a Zeiss LSM 510
confocal microscope.
To observe autophagosomes in vivo, mouse liver tissues were
harvested, frozen, and cryosectioned. As previously reported
(16), the GFP-LC3 distribution in frozen sections was directly
observed and recorded by ﬂuorescent confocal microscopy.
The acquired images were converted to 8-bit binary ﬁles, and
the number, size, and total occupied area of GFP-LC3 punctate
foci greater than 4 pixels in diameter on each image were
calculated by ImageJ software.
Partial hepatectomy and liver regeneration
Liver regeneration induced by partial hepatectomy and
subsequent analysis were done as described previously (19).
Brieﬂy, two thirds of the liver was surgically removed from 1.5month-old male mice (20). Mice were sacriﬁced 48 hours later.
Samples were collected from the regenerated liver tissues and
processed for analyses.
Isolation of liver nuclei and ﬂow cytometric analysis
Male mice of indicated age were sacriﬁced by cervical
dislocation. Their livers were rapidly removed and frozen in
the liquid nitrogen. The frozen livers were thawed and used to
isolate nuclei as described previously (21). For ﬂow cytometric
analysis, the nuclei pellet was resuspended in propidium iodide
(PI) buffer (50 mg/mL PI and 10 mg/mL RNAse in PBS). The
resuspended nuclei were set for 30 minutes at 4 C and analyzed
by ﬂow cytometry. The individual proﬁles of each type of mice
were superimposed on each other and DNA contents at 2N
peaks were measured. The number of nuclei under each peak of
2N to 8N was counted.

MAP1S and Hepatocarcinogenesis

Results
Depletion of MAP1S gene accelerates DEN-induced
hepatocarcinogenesis in mice
To investigate the tumor suppression function of the
MAP1S gene, we set up pairs of wild-type and MAP1Sdepleted mice under identical condition without carcinogen
and observed for tumorigenesis in all of organs. No abnormality associated with the onset of neoplasia was detected

up to the age of 12 months. For example, liver tissues of
MAP1S-depleted mice were as healthy as those of wild-type
mice (Fig. 1A and B). We reasoned that although depletion of
MAP1S may not be sufﬁcient to initiate tumorigenesis, the
presence of MAP1S may suppress tumorigenesis induced
under certain types of stresses.
We started to induce hepatocarcinogenesis with DEN, a
speciﬁc initiator of hepatocyte carcinogenesis (18). Littermates
of wild-type (þ/þ) and MAP1S-depleted mice (/) were

subjected to a single dose of DEN injection at 15 days postnatally when their livers underwent active proliferation. Their
livers reached the full sizes of mature livers approximately 2
weeks later. We checked for hepatocarcinogenesis and found
tumor foci in MAP1S-depleted liver tissues at 6 months and in
wild-type liver tissues at 8 months after birth (Fig. 1A and B).
Histologically, the tumor foci were primarily hepatocellular
adenomas that caused compression but no disruption of the
surrounding normal tissue (Fig. 1C). When mice became older,
their body weights were not signiﬁcantly changed, but tumor
incidence, average number of surface tumors per mouse, and
ratio of liver weight to body weight (LW/BW) were gradually
increased. The MAP1S-depleted mice had signiﬁcantly higher
tumor incidence, average number of surface tumors per
mouse, and ratio of liver weight to body weight (LW/BW)
than wild-type mice at the same ages (Fig. 1A, B, D, and E).
Therefore, MAP1S is a tumor suppression gene.
Further detailed examination revealed that hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) was detected 10 months after birth (Fig. 1A
and B). The typical trabecular hepatocarcinomas coexisted
with the lipid droplet-containing adenomas in aged mice (Fig.
1F), but the MAP1S-depleted mice displayed higher incidence
of HCC than the wild-type (Fig. 1A, B, and G). Depletion of
MAP1S gene not only promoted the initiation of tumor foci but
also accelerated the conversion of hepatocellular adenomas to
malignant hepatocarcinomas.
Acute elevation of MAP1S levels immediately upon
exposure to DEN leads to activation of autophagy and
reduction of DNA DSB
Although the mechanism is not clearly deciphered, autophagy has been hypothesized to reduce chromosomal instability and suppress tumorigenesis through elimination of
p62-associated aggregated proteins (7, 8). We attempted to
deduce a role of MAP1S-regulated autophagy in tumor
suppression. The expression levels of MAP1S in normal
hepatocytes were too low to be detected by immunoblotting,
but were dramatically elevated immediately on exposure to
DEN, and then reduced to an undetectable level 2 days after
exposure to DEN (Fig. 2A). Our previous results have suggested that MAP1S levels increase on autophagic activation
(16). The wild-type accumulated fewer autophagosomes
labeled with GFP-LC3 punctate foci in hepatocytes than
MAP1S-depleted mice (Fig. 2B and C), indicating that the
acute elevation of MAP1S caused activation of both autophagy initiation and autophagosomal degradation. Examination of LC3-II levels representing a balance of autophagosomal generation and degradation at each sampling point in
detail revealed that acute elevation of MAP1S on DEN
exposure enhanced both events but still did not efﬁciently
process all autophagosomes such that a certain amount of
autophagosomes accumulated and reached a peak at 12
hours. The MAP1S-deﬁcient mice may generate autophagosomes slowly such that LC3-II levels reached a peak at least
12 hours later than the wild-type mice; in addition, they less
efﬁciently remove autophagosomes through lysosomes such
that LC3-II levels dropped to base levels 5 days later than in
the wild-type mice (Fig. 2A and D).

MAP1S and GFP-LC3 signals distributed in cells in a
mutually exclusively manner, indicating that autophagosomes had been degraded efﬁciently in cells with elevated
levels of MAP1S. Approximately 40% of cells had enhanced
levels of MAP1S and activated autophagy to degrade autophagosomes whereas the other 60% cells did not have
increased levels of MAP1S to degrade autophagosomes.
More than 80% of hepatocytes accumulated autophagosomes in the MAP1S-depleted mice (Fig. 2E and F), further
conﬁrming the role of MAP1S in autophagy. Because of
active autophagy, the wild-type hepatocytes were able to
efﬁciently eliminate the p62-associated aggresomes and
dysfunctional organelles. Two weeks after exposure, levels
of p62 reduced to levels close to but still higher than those
before exposure. In contrast, the MAP1S-deﬁcient hepatocytes maintained higher levels of p62 than the wild-type
mice (Fig. 2A and D). Therefore, elevated levels of MAP1S
lead to activation of autophagy to reduce the DEN-induced
aggresomes and dysfunctional organelles.
Protein aggresomes and dysfunctional organelles such as
mitochondria and endoplasm reticulum induce oxidative
stress that causes DNA DSB and genome instability
(7, 8, 22). Intensity of DNA DSB is represented by the levels
of phosphorylated H2AX (g-H2AX; ref. 23). No DNA DSB labeled
with g-H2X was found in untreated hepatocytes of both wildtype and MAP1S-depleted mice (Fig. 2G). Together with the
acute elevation of MAP1S levels, DNA DSB was also dramatically intensiﬁed immediately on exposure to DEN (Fig. 2A, D,
and H). Similar to the mutually exclusive distribution of GFPLC3 punctate foci and MAP1S signals, MAP1S levels were lower
in the cells with DNA DSB (Fig. 2G). The MAP1S-depleted mice
exhibited higher levels of DNA DSB in hepatocytes immediately
on DEN treatment and maintained higher levels than the
wild-type mice until livers became fully mature 2 weeks after
DEN treatment (Fig. 2A, D, and H). Therefore, depletion of the
MAP1S gene impaired normal autophagy function, leading to
accumulation of higher levels of genome instability that
increase the chance to form tumor foci in the future.
The DEN-induced DNA DSB and genome instability that
persist in the adult liver tissues are suppressed by MAP1S
It is well known that chromosomal fragments with DSB tend
to randomly fuse either correctly with the original broken
chromosomal fragment or erroneously with a fragment broken
from another chromosome. The erroneously ligated chromosome undergoes breakage–fusion–bridge cycles in successive
mitoses that eventually lead to chromosome instability (24).
Majority of hepatocytes with DNA DSB on DEN treatment had
their broken ends fused such that no g-H2X signal could readily
be detected 1 month after exposure to DEN. We hypothesized
that those hepatocytes could still generate daughter cells with
DNA DSB because of the breakage–fusion–bridge mechanism.
However, nearly no mitotic hepatocyte could be identiﬁed in
the adult livers (Fig. 3A); therefore, that it was technically
difﬁcult to test the hypothesis. To increase the mitotic index,
we conducted partial hepatectomy to induce liver regeneration
in 2-month-old mice, which led to a dramatic increase in the
number of mitotic hepatocytes (Fig. 3A).

Both normal and DEN-treated mitotic hepatocytes were
induced into mitosis during liver regeneration. The untreated
mitotic hepatocytes exhibited no DNA DSB, whereas mitotic
hepatocytes that had been exposed to DEN 1.5 months
previously contained a large number of DNA DSB (Fig. 3B).
The DNA DSB signals were seen to clearly overlap with the
condensed chromosomes in the mitotic hepatocytes (Fig. 3C).
Relatively, fewer mitotic hepatocytes carried DNA DSB in the
wild-type than in the MAP1S-depleted mice (Fig. 3B and D).
Although partial hepatectomy created a highly artiﬁcial and
unexpected biologic condition, the results indicated that hepatocytes in DEN-treated MAP1S-depleted mice had a higher
chance than the wild-type to generate daughter hepatocytes
with genome instability if they had a chance to re-enter mitosis.
We further examined the livers of 4-month-old DEN-treated
mice and found no tumor foci in either wild-type or MAP1Sdepleted mice (Fig. 1A). Constant evolution of the destabilized
genomes during the 3.5 months after exposure to DEN might
lead to preservation of DNA DSB although no tumor focus was
detectable. The MAP1S-depleted mice contained slightly but
signiﬁcantly higher levels of DNA DSB in livers that did not
develop into any detectable tumor focus yet (Fig. 4A and B).
Examination of DNA contents by ﬂow cytometry revealed that
hepatocytes from both wild-type and the MAP1S-depleted

7542

Cancer Res; 71(24) December 15, 2011

mice contained amounts of genomic DNA that had deviated
from their normal 2N DNA content (Fig. 4C). The depletion of
MAP1S gene caused a wider range of variation of 2N DNA
contents (Fig. 4C and D) and had a higher percentage of
polyploidy hepatocytes (Fig. 4C and E). Polyploidy cells often
lead to generation of aneuploidy and genome instability during
proliferation because of weakened mitotic checkpoint (25).
Thus, the knockout mice had higher levels of tumorigenesisdriving genome instability.
Elevation of MAP1S levels within tumor foci of DENtreated mice leads to activation of autophagy inﬂux and
reduction of DNA DSB
The persistence of higher genomic instability in the MAP1Sdepleted hepatocytes represented a higher chance of tumorigenesis, which explains why the MAP1S-depleted mice had
higher tumor incidence and more surface tumors than the
wild-type mice. However, the reason for the MAP1S-depleted
mice developing more malignant HCC was not explained. We
measured the MAP1S levels adenomas of similar sizes in DENtreated 10-month-old mouse livers. The levels of MAP1S were
undetectable in non–tumor-adjacent liver tissues from wildtype mice, and were similar to the levels in liver tissues of
untreated mice (Fig. 2A), but dramatically elevated in the

majority of tumor foci (Fig. 5A–C). It was likely that such
increase was caused by metabolic stresses that resulted from
genome instability.
Cells in the aged livers contained different genomes
among different individuals (Fig. 4C and D). Each diversiﬁed
genome evolves and adopts a different set of autophagy
machinery. Under such conditions, the LC3-II levels may
represent balances of different generation and degradation
rates. As expected, the LC3-II levels were not signiﬁcantly
different between tumor foci and neighboring tissues, and
between wild-type and MAP1S-deﬁcient mice (Fig. 5C and
D). However, high levels of MAP1S indicate activation of
autophagy inﬂux leading to reduction of autophagy substrates (16). More p62-associated protein aggregates and
dysfunctional organelles accumulated in MAP1S-deﬁcient
tumor foci (Fig. 5C, E, and F), indicating dramatic reduction

www.aacrjournals.org

of autophagy inﬂux. The increase of MAP1S levels leads to
increase of autophagy inﬂux and reduction of p62 levels in
the DEN-induced tumor foci of wild-type livers. The deﬁciency in autophagic response in the tumor foci of the
MAP1S-depleted livers reﬂected by such accumulation correspondingly led to increase of DNA DSB (Fig. 5C, G, and H).
Higher degree of genomic instability in the tumor foci led to
development of more malignant HCC. Thus, an active
autophagy suppressed genome instability in tumor foci such
that a less malignant tumor was developed.

Discussion
Chromosomal instability, as the most common type of

Figure 5. Elevation of MAP1S levels leads to activation of autophagy inﬂux and reduction of DNA DSB within tumor foci in livers of DEN-treated 10-month-old
mice. A, representative images showing the immunostaining patterns of MAP1S in adjacent tumor tissues (T) and normal tissues (NT) from livers of DENtreated 10-month-old WT (þ/þ) and MAP1S-depleted mice (/). All bars in this ﬁgure are equal to 100 mm. B, a summary of percentage of MAP1S-positive
tumor foci in livers of WT (þ/þ) and MAP1S KO mice (/). Approximately 10 hepatoadenomas were examined for each group. C, immunoblot of lysates from
adjacent tumor tissues (T) and normal tissues (NT) isolated from livers of DEN-treated 10-month-old WT (þ/þ) and MAP1S-depleted mice (/). The same
amount of total proteins was loaded for each lane. D, a plot of relative intensities of LC3-II bands shown in C with the value in the ﬁrst WT tumor sample as the
standard. Data are the mean and SD of 3 repeats. E, representative images showing immunostaining proﬁles of liver tissues carrying hepatoadenoma with
antibody against p62. F, a plot of relative intensities of p62 bands shown in C with the value in the ﬁrst WT tumor sample as the standard. Data are the mean and
SD of 3 repeats. The signiﬁcances of differences between tumor and adjacent normal tissues and between WT and KO mice were determined by the Student t
test;  , P < 0.05. G, representative images showing immunostaining proﬁles of liver tissues carrying hepatoadenoma with antibody against g-H2AX. H, a plot of
relative intensities of g-H2AX bands shown in C. Data were collected and analyzed similarly as in F.

aneuploidy due to chromosomal rearrangements including
deletions, ampliﬁcations, or translocation (26). Although aneuploidy is not synonymous with chromosomal instability (26),
aneuploidy was hypothesized to be the origin of tumorigenesis
(27). Since then, it has been strongly debated whether point
mutation or genomic instability is the cause or a consequence
of tumorigenesis (28). Our results indicate that, early before
tumorigenesis, signiﬁcant levels of genomic instability exist in
the liver tissues exposed to the chemical carcinogen DEN. This
indicates that genomic instability may be the cause of hepatocarcinogenesis. The positive correlation between genomic
instability and malignancy of tumor foci as revealed in this
study further indicates that genomic instability is also a driving
force in cancer development. Thus, high levels of genomic
instability provide high chances of tumor initiation and
wide genetic variation to evolve into highly malignant tumor
foci.
An inverse relationship between autophagic activity and
malignant transformation has been established since 1999 (29).

active protein Bif-1/ mutant mice enforced a role of autophagy in tumor suppression (6, 10, 11, 30). The ATG4C-depleted
mice show an increased susceptibility to develop ﬁbrosarcomas induced by chemical carcinogens (9). Similarly, the
MAP1S-depeleted mice have shown a suppressive role in
DEN-induced hepatocarcinomas. The contradiction indicates
that ATG5, ATG7, Beclin-1, and Bif-1 may play roles in addition
to autophagic regulation.
To understand the relationship between autophagy and
tumor suppression, a link through p62 and g-H2AX has been
well established (7, 8). p62, or sequestosome 1, associates with
ubiquitin-positive Mallory–Denk bodies in hepatocytes of
patients with alcoholic hepatitis and a variety of other liver
diseases (31). The p62 protein serves as receptor to bind with
ubiquitinated substrates such as aggregated proteins and
dysfunctional organelles including mitochondria for autophagosomal biogenesis, and its levels represent the amount of
aggregated proteins and dysfunctional organelles accumulated
in cells (32). Balanced autophagy aids cells in clearance of
aggregated proteins and dysfunctional organelles and, thereby,
reduces p62 levels that serve as accurate monitors of the

MAP1S and Hepatocarcinogenesis

intensity of cellular oxidative stress. A defect in autophagy
enhances oxidative stress resulting in cell death (7). However,
oxidative stress leads to DNA DSB (22, 33, 34) because it can
simultaneously subvert mitotic checkpoints (35, 36).
From a cytogenetic perspective, a chromosomal fragment
with a break tends to randomly fuse with another broken
chromosomal fragment, which potentially leads to the formation of a new chromosome with 2 centromeres if ligation
occurs between 2 fragments with centromeres. The cell containing the chromosome with 2 centromeres forms a chromosomal bridge during mitotic metaphase and the resultant
chromosomal bridge will break and generate new broken ends
after telophase (24, 37). Modern molecular biology indicates
that DNA DSB will be repaired through either homologous
recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ),
whereas NHEJ is believed to be the predominant mechanism of
DSB repair in higher eukaryotes (38). Cells with DSBs will
experience a mitotic defect that will activate mitotic checkpoint and temporally result in mitotic arrest and mitotic cell
death (15). If cells can escape the arresting through the socalled mitotic slippage, the resultant aneuploidy daughter cells
are generally lethal. Therefore, genome instability is intrinsically tumor suppressive (39). However, if an aneuploidy cell can
escape the mitotic checkpoint and survive, it potentially initiates a cascade of autocatalytic karyotypic evolution through
continuous cycles of chromosomal breakage–fusion–bridge
and eventually destabilizes the genome. A destabilized genome
results in either inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or
activation of oncogenes through point mutation, rearrangement of wild-type genes in new locations on genome to create
malfunctions, or creation of fusion gene between different
wild-type genes to fulﬁll a new function. Such genetic variation
generates the opportunity for phenotypic selection, which
results in continuous evolution and diversity of cancer phenotypes during the progression (24, 28, 40). Thus, autophagic
defect-resultant oxidative stress could either suppress tumorigenesis if it can trigger cell death or promote tumorigenesis if
the cells can survive the insult of oxidative stress.
It has been known that animals exposed to DEN exhibit
increased levels of oxidative stress (41). We believe that such
increase in oxidative stress may be caused by accumulation of
p62-associated protein aggresomes and dysfunctional organelles. We knew that MAP1S positively regulates autophagic
activity and its increase on DEN exposure indicates an autop-

hagic activation. Activated autophagy leads to removal of p62
and reduction of oxidative stress while animals with defective
autophagy accumulate high levels of p62 and oxidative stress.
MAP1S-activated autophagy causes reduction of both oxidative stress and genomic instability immediately on DEN exposure. The MAP1S-depleted mice accumulate higher levels of
genomic instability and have higher probability to generate
tumor progenitor cells that will be developed into visible tumor
foci several months later. For the tumor progenitor cells to
evolve into large tumor foci, cells continue multiple rounds of
mitoses that will further destabilize the genome and results in
accumulation of oxidative stress (42). Such stress will reactivate MAP1S-regulated autophagic machinery and, in turn,
reduce the levels of p62 and oxidative stress. The inactive
autophagy in MAP1S-depleted mice causes accumulation of
p62, oxidative stress, and genomic instability in tumor foci.
Mice with a destabilized genome will develop highly malignant
hepatocarcinomas. The high incidence of tumor foci and
hepatocarcinomas in the MAP1S-depleted mice clearly attest
that MAP1S suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis through regulation of autophagy.
