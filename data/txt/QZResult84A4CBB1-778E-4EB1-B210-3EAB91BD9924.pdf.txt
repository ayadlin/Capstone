ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer, but is the second
leading cause of cancer deaths, partially due to its heterogeneity and drug resistance.
Sorafenib is the only medical treatment with a proven efficacy against advanced
HCC, but its overall clinical efficacy is still modest. Therefore, a major challenge is
how to improve its therapeutic efficacy. The unique prolyl isomerase Pin1 regulates
numerous cancer-driving pathways. Notably, Pin1 is overexpressed in about 70% HBVpositive HCC patients and contributes to HCC tumorigenesis. However, the role of Pin1
in the efficacy of sorafenib against HCC is unknown. Here we found that sorafenib
down-regulated Pin1 mRNA and protein expression, likely through inhibition of Pin1
transcription by the Rb/E2F pathway. Importantly, Pin1 knockdown potently enhanced
the ability of sorafenib to induce cell death in HCC, which was further supported by the
findings that Pin1 knockdown led to stabilization of Fbxw7 and destabilization of Mcl-1.
Furthermore, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a known anticancer drug that inhibits and
ultimately induces degradation of active Pin1 in cancer cells, also potently sensitized
HCC cells to sorafenib-induced cell death at least in part through a caspase-dependent
manner. Moreover, ATRA also synergistically enhanced the ability of sorafenib to reduce
Pin1 and inhibit tumor growth of HCC in mouse xenograft models. Collectively, these
results not only demonstrate that Pin1 down-regulation is a key event underlying the
anti-tumor effects of sorafenib, but also uncover that Pin1 inhibitors offer a novel
approach to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib against HCC.

INTRODUCTION

lack of efficacious targeted therapy to control high interand intra-tumor heterogeneity and complexity of etiology
in this cancer, with multiple cancer-driving pathways
being often activated at the same time.
Sorafenib is the only medical treatment that was
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the
treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with
a proven efficacy [3–7]. Sorafenib was originally designed
to target on the Raf family of protein kinases, which control

the incidence rate of liver cancer increases from 2003 to
2012 in the United States [2]. More importantly, liver

cell proliferation and tumor development in many types of
cancer including HCC [8]. Pharmacological profiling studies
have identified several receptor tyrosine kinases as its targets,
such as VEGFR1/2/3/, PDGFR, c-Kit and RET, conferring
sorafenib as a multi-kinase inhibitor [9]. However, patients
with advanced HCC only benefit no more than 3 months
survival advantage from sorafenib treatment [4].
As a consequence of the lack of more effective
compounds or treatment strategies, a major aim of biological
research is to improve the efficacy of sorafenib against
HCC [7]. VEGFA amplification was identified as a key
biomarker for patients who might be sensitive to sorafenib
treatment [10]. In another study, in vivo RNA interference
screening targeting on genes located within focal genomic
amplification identified MAPK14 as a key regulator of
sorafenib resistance in liver cancer [11]. Combinational
blockade of MAPK14 and other key regulators is proposed
to overcome sorafenib resistance in human HCC[12].
These two pioneer works implicate a promise for sorafenib
precision therapy and combinational therapy in HCC.
Recently, to enhance the ability of sorafenib to induce
cell death in HCC has been proposed to be a new strategy.
Sorafenib alone leads to apoptosis [13] or iron dependent
cell death, named ferroptosis [14], in a cell type specific
manner. The role of sorafenib in HCC cell death is attributed
to down-regulating Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1 (Myeloid
Cell Leukemia-1) [15]. Sorafenib blocks Erk mediated
Mcl-1 phosphorylation on Thr92, which de-stabilizes Mcl1 [16]. On the other hand, sorafenib activates GSK3beta
by attenuating the inhibitory phosphorylation on Ser9 [17].
Activated GSK3beta phosphorylates Mcl-1 on Ser159
and Thr163, leading to its interaction with Fbxw7, an E3
ubiquitin ligase [18]. Additional mechanisms have been
reported in other cancer types. Sorafenib has been shown
to perturb mitochondrial function and reduce intracellular
ATP levels, leading to activation of AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mTORC1 activity, which
finally promotes cell death in breast cancer cells [19].
Sorafenib can also induce down-regulation of survivin,
leading to apoptotic cell death in human non-small lung
cancer cells [20]. However, Sorafenib does not target these
proteins directly so that the upstream regulators for this
process remain to be elucidated.
The unique prolyl isomerase, Pin1 is prevalently
overexpressed or over-activated in many types of cancer
including HCC [21, 22]. Accumulating evidences
have demonstrated that Pin1 plays a key role in cancer
development, progression and prognosis by turning on more
than 40 oncogenes/growth-promoting proteins and turning
off more than 20 tumor suppressors/growth-inhibiting
proteins at the same time [21]. Pin1 catalyzes cis-trans
isomerization of specific phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs
and induce conformational change of proteins after prolinedirected Ser/Thr phosphorylation [23], thereby affecting
activities and stabilities of its substrates [24]. Notably,
Pin1 is specifically overexpressed in more than 70% HBVwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

related HCC in China [22, 25] and Pin1 overexpression
transforms normal liver cells [26]. Interestingly, many
mediators of sorafenib induced cell death, such as Fbxw7,
Mcl-1, survivin and AMPK are phosphorylated on Ser/
Thr-Pro motif and their protein stabilities and activities
are regulated by Pin1-catalyzed cis-trans isomerization
[16, 24, 27–29]. However, the role of Pin1 in the HCC
treatment, especially sorafenib-based targeted therapy is
still uncharacterized. Given the critic role of Pin1 in HCC
development [30], we investigate whether Pin1 plays a role
in anti-tumor effects of sorafenib in HCC. In this present
study, we showed that Pin1 expression is down regulated
upon sorafenib treatment and inhibition of Pin1 either by
genetic or chemical ablation potentiates anti-tumor efficacy
of sorafenib against HCC in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
Sorafenib down-regulates Pin1 expression in
multiple human HCC cells
To determine the role of Pin1 in response of
HCC cells to Sorafenib, we first examined the effect of
sorafenib on Pin1 expression. Human HCC cell lines,
Huh7 and HepG2 cells, were treated with sorafenib
for indicated times. Sorafenib dramatically suppressed
Pin1 biosynthesis and accumulation both in Huh7 and
HepG2 cells (Figure 1A and 1B). Dose-response analysis
for sorafenib induced Pin1 down-regulation was also
performed in Huh7, HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells.
Sorafenib treatment led to a does-dependent decrease
in Pin1 protein levels, as compared to vehicle controls
in all HCC cell lines examined (Figure 1C, 1E and 1G).
To further investigate whether sorafenib down-regulated
Pin1 expression at the mRNA level, real-time PCR was
performed to detect Pin1 mRNA levels in Huh7, HepG2
and PLC/PRF/5 treated with 5 µM sorafenib for 24
hours. Sorafenib treatments also significantly downregulated Pin1 mRNA (Figure 1D, 1F and 1H). The
ability of sorafenib to reduce Pin1 expression was further
confirmed by the observations that sorafenib attenuated
Rb phosphorylation on Serine 807/811 (Figure 1I) in
a dose-dependent manner, which was correlated with
down-regulation of Pin1 protein (Figure 1I). These
results are consistent with the previous findings that the
Rb-E2F pathway regulates Pin1 transcription [31] and
that sorafenib inhibits the Rb-E2F pathway by reducing
Rb phosphorylation on Serine 807/811 [32]. These data
together show that sorafenib down-regulates Pin1 mRNA
and protein expression in multiple human HCC cells.

Pin1 knockdown potently enhances the ability of
sorafenib to induce cell death
Inducing direct cytotoxicity in cancer cells is one
of the main goals of anticancer treatments [33]. Although

Sorafenib has been shown to induce cell death in HCC
cells, it is weakly pro-apoptotic as a single agent [13]. In
order to investigate the significance of Pin1 in sorafenibinduced cell death, we stably knocked down Pin1
expression in Huh7, HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 HCC cells
using validated Pin1 shRNA lentiviruses, which led to
effective Pin1 knockdown, as compared with scrambled
shRNA control cells (Figure 2A, 2D and 2G), as described
previously [34]. Pin1 knockdown and control cells were
treated with 10 µM sorafenib for 72 hours and stained
with propidium iodide (pI) and Hoechst33342, which
have been previously shown to stain dead/late apoptotic
and early apoptotic/normal cells, respectively [35, 36].
Silencing Pin1 expression by genetic knockdown
drastically enhanced the ability of sorafenib to induce cell
death in these HCC cell lines, as indicated by pI staining
(Figure 2B, 2E and 2H). Moreover, the effects were also
dependent on the dose of sorafenib (Figure 2C, 2F and 2I).
These results demonstrate that Pin1 knockdown potently
enhances the ability of sorafenib to induce cell death in
multiple human HCC cells.
Next, we investigated the molecular mechanisms
underlying the effects of Pin1 in sorafenib-induced
cell death. Pin1 has been shown to regulate multiple
anti- or pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax [37], Mcl-1
[16] and survivin [28]. Sorafenib has also been shown
to induce cell death through activation of Bax [38] or
down-regulation of Mcl-1 [39] and survivin [20]. The
degradation of Mcl-1 has been shown to depend on Erkmediated phosphorylation [16] and Fbxw7-mediated
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [18]. Interestingly, it has
been shown that Pin1 stabilizes Mcl-1 through direct
binding to Mcl-1 [16] and promoting Fbxw7 degradation
[40]. Therefore, we examined the expression of these
Pin1 substrate proteins in Pin1 knockdown and control
cells. Pin1 knockdown led to up-regulation of Fbxw7 in
Huh7, HepG2, Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5 cells (Figure 3A
and 3B), as expected from the previous studies [40]. Bax
activation was detected in Pin1 knockdown Huh7 and
Hep3B cells (Figure 3A), while Mcl-1 down-regulation
was detected in Pin1 knockdown PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2
cells (Figure 3B). Furthermore, sorafenib induced Mcl-1
degradation was dose-dependent and correlated with Pin1
down-regulation (Figure 3C). These data implicate that
Pin1 shRNA potently enhances the ability of sorafenib to
induce cell death in HCC cells, which is further supported
by the findings that Pin1 knockdown leads to the
stabilization of Fbxw7 and the destabilization of Mcl-1.

based screening from a compound library [41]. ATRA
binds to active Pin1 selectively in cancer cells, leading
to its degradation and exerting potent anti-tumor activity
against acute promyelocytic leukemia and breast cancer
[41]. Although 25 µM ATRA had moderate effects on
Pin1 expression probably due to cytochrome P450dependent ATRA metabolism in HCC cells, as we have
shown [42, 43], ATRA significantly enhanced sorafenibinduced down-regulation of Pin1 expression (Figure 4A
and 4B), demonstrating a synergistic effect of ATRA
and sorafenib on reducing Pin1 expression. Accordingly,
sorafenib and ATRA also had synergistic effects on Pin1
downstream targets, including expression of Fbxw7, Mcl-1
and survivin, and phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr172
(Figure 4A and 4B).
In order to investigate whether ATRA also enhances
sorafenib-induced cell death, we treated HepG2 cells with
increasing doses of sorafenib in the absence or presence
of ATRA for 72 hours, followed by assaying dead and live
cells using flow cytometry after pI staining, as described
[44]. ATRA alone could not induce cell death, as shown
previously [41] and sorafenib weakly induced cell death
(Figure 4C), as shown before [13]. However, a combination
of ATRA with sorafenib led to a significant increase in cell
death (Figure 4C and 4D), supported by the synergistic
reduction of the intracellular ATP level (Figure 4E).
ATRA also dramatically enhanced sorafenib-induced
inhibition of cell growth (Supplementary Figure 1A) and
colony formation (Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C) in
Huh7 cells. Furthermore, these results indicate that ATRA
enhances the ability of sorafenib to reduce Pin1 expression
and to induce cell death.
Since ATRA directly binds to Pin1, leading to
inhibition of its enzyme activity and eventual its protein
degradation [45], we proposed that the molecular
mechanism underlying the synergistic Pin1 downregulation induced by sorafenib and ATRA could be
due to a combinational effect of sorafenib-mediated
Pin1 biosynthesis inhibition and ATRA-mediated Pin1
degradation. Indeed, the proteasome inhibitor MG132
could partially reversed the synergistic effect, but not
sorafenib-induced Pin1 down-regulation (Figure 5A).
To investigate the role of Pin1 down-regulation in the
combination of sorafenib- and ATRA-induced cell
death, we compared the effects of sorafenib and ATRA
in Pin1 knockdown and control cells. In both Huh7
and HepG2 cells, Pin1 knockdown attenuated ATRAmediated enhancement of sorafenib-induced cell death
(Figure 5B and 5C). Accordingly, Pin1 knockdown
enhanced sorafenib-induced activation of AMPK and
attenuated ATRA-mediated enhancement of sorafenibinduced activation of AMPK (Figure 5D).
In order to determine the molecular mechanisms
underlying cell death induced by the combination of
sorafenib and ATRA, we treated Huh7 cells with several
potent cell death inhibitors. Interestingly, zVAD, a caspase

inhibitor, dramatically blocked cell death induced by the
combination of sorafenib and ATRA (Figure 6A and 6B).
In contrast, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1, a necroptosis inhibitor),
ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor), deferoxamine
(DFX, an iron chelator) or chloroquine (CQ, an autophagy
inhibitor) had little influence on sorafenib induced
cell death (Figure 6A and 6B). Moreover, the effect of
zVAD on cell death induced by sorafenib and ATRA was
dose-dependent (Figure 6C). Supportively, synergistic
activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 were also observed
under sorafenib and ATRA combinational treatment
(Figure 6D). Together, these data indicates that ATRA
enhances the ability of sorafenib to induce apoptosis in
HCC cells.

Given the potent ability of the Pin1 chemical
inhibitor ATRA to enhance sorafenib-induced cell death
in HCC cell lines, a critical question is whether ATRA
would affect the anti-tumor efficacy of sorafenib in HCC
in vivo. To address this question, Huh7 cells were injected
subcutaneously into nude mice to establish xenograft
tumor and 16 days later, when the tumors were detectable,
mice were randomly grouped into four groups and treated
with sorafenib, ATRA or combination of sorafenib and
ATRA or vehicle saline, respectively. ATRA was implanted

under the skin in the back of the neck using a slow
releasing formula, as described [41]. Sorafenib was given
by oral gavage, as described [10]. A low dose of ATRA
(one-fourth pellet of 10 mg over 21 days) alone had the
modest effect on tumor growth, while sorafenib alone did
not inhibit tumor growth until the late stages (Figure 7A).
By contrast, the combination of ATRA with sorafenib
completely stopped HCC tumor growth, even leading to
tumor shrinkage at the late stage (Figure 7A). When the
tumors were harvested, weights of tumors treated with
the combination of ATRA and sorafenib were only onethird of those treated with vehicle or ATRA alone, and
one half of those treated with sorafenib alone (Figure 7B
and 7C), demonstrating the strong synergistic effect of
ATRA with sorafenib in inhibiting tumor growth in vivo.
These results were further confirmed by the findings that
Pin1, and its substrate effectors Mcl-1 and survivin, were
down-regulated by sorafenib, and largely depleted by a
combination of sorafenib and ATRA in tumors (Figure 7D).
Consistent with the findings that a synergistic effect of
sorafenib and ATRA on cell death could be blocked by the
caspase inhibitor zVAD, cleavage of caspase 9 and caspase
3 were robustly detected upon combinational treatment of
sorafenib and ATRA, indicating that sorafenib and ATRA
synergistically inhibit tumor growth by inducing apoptosis.
Taken together, these data consistently demonstrate that

ATRA synergistically enhances the ability of sorafenib to
induce Pin1 down-regulation, cell death and inhibit tumor
growth of HCC in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Sorafenib is the only medical treatment for the
treatment of advanced HCC with a proven efficacy, but its
effect is still limited [3–7]. Therefore, the identification of
key factors and developing combinational drugs to enhance
the efficacy of sorafenib in HCC is one of the attractive
strategies. Here we show that sorafenib down-regulated
Pin1 protein by inhibiting its biosynthesis. Genetic
knockdown of Pin1 sensitized HCC cells to sorafenibinduced cell death. Moreover, the Pin1 chemical inhibitor
ATRA not only enhanced the ability of sorafenib to
induce cell death of multiple human HCC cells in vitro,
but also synergistically potentiated sorafenib to suppress
human HCC tumor growth in mice. These results
demonstrate for the first time that Pin1 down-regulation
is one of the key events underlying the anti-tumor
effects of sorafenib and more importantly, uncover that
Pin1 inhibitors offer a novel approach to enhance the
therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib against HCC.
Sorafenib was originally designed to target on Raf
family, which is a Ser/Thr kinase and a pivotal regulator

of cellular proliferation [46]. Recently, an increasing
body of evidence has shown that sorafenib has a profound
impact on cellular signaling [9]. For example, Sorafenib
turns off transcriptional and translational machinery by
activating Rb and suppressing mTORC1, respectively
[32]. In this study, we show for the first time sorafenib
could down-regulate Pin1 expression at least in part

through inhibiting its mRNA transcription by the E2F/
Rb pathway. Given the fact that Pin1 promotes cancer
development through activating more than 40 oncogenes/
growth-promoting proteins and inactivating over 20
tumor suppressors [21], sorafenib induced Pin1 downregulation might in part account for its multiple targeting
effect in HCC.

It has become evident that blocking a single pathway
may not be effective in solid tumors, especially aggressive
or drug-resistant ones due to feedback and simultaneous
activation of a wide range of interactive and/or redundant
pathways [21, 47, 48]. Especially, liver cancer is a highly
inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneous disease [49] so
that targeting multiple cancer-driving pathways has its
advantage in cancer therapy. Notably, Pin1 promotes
cancer development by turning on and off dozens of
oncogenes and tumor suppressors, respectively [21].
Moreover, Pin1 knockout mice develop normally [50] but
are highly resistance to Ras, Neu/HER2 induced breast
cancer [51] or Myc-induced Burkitt’s lymphoma [52].
These results indicate that Pin1 is dispensable in normal
cells but is required for tumor cells, which confers Pin1
as an ideal anti-tumor candidate. These results implicate
a promise for Pin1-targeting therapy in HCC, especially
given its overexpression in about 70% HBV-related HCC
[22]. However, to test this possibility was challenging due

to lack of functional active Pin1 inhibitors until the recent
identification of ATRA as a Pin1 inhibitor [21, 41].
The ability of ATRA to enhance sorafenib-induced
cell death has been shown in acute myeloid leukemia [53]
and liver cancer [54, 55], but the underlying molecular
mechanisms are still largely unknown. In this study, we
show that sorafenib and ATRA have strong synergic
effect on Pin1 down-regulation both in vitro and in vivo,
indicating a pivotal role of Pin1 on sorafenib induced cell
death. Indeed, both genetic knockdown and chemical
inhibition using ATRA could dramatically increase
sorafenib induced cell death. This is of particular interest
since enhancing sorafenib-induced cell death in HCC is
expected to improve clinical benefit from sorafenib. Our
xenograft mice data have shown that sorafenib alone
leads to tumor stasis only later stages, but not shrinkage
of tumor size, as shown previously [56], which could be
attributed to its inhibitory effect on cell growth, but not
cell survival. By contrast, the combination of sorafenib

with slow-releasing ATRA not only potently stops
HCC tumor growth, but also leads to decline of tumor
volumes. These results suggest that clinical combination
of sorafenib and the Pin1 inhibitor ATRA might be a new
strategy to improve therapeutic efficacy in HCC. However,
ATRA has a short half-life of 45 min in humans [57] and
regular ATRA has moderate but detectable efficacy against
solid tumors in some clinical trials, new generations of
supposedly much more potent retinoid derivatives to
target RARs or RXRs show little efficacy [58–62], which
is likely due to the failure of these retinoids to inhibit Pin1
[41]. Taken together, these results provide a rationale for
developing longer half-life ATRA or more potent and
specific Pin1-targeted ATRA variants to overcome drug
resistance in cancer therapy, especially in combination
with sorafenib for HCC.
In summary, our results have identified Pin1
down-regulation as a key event underlying the anti-tumor
effects of sorafenib, and also provide the strong rationale
for further development of Pin1 inhibitors as a novel
approach to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib
against HCC, one of the most lethal cancers.

(2800 Woods Hollow Road, Madison, WI, USA). ATRA
slow releasing pellet (#V-111) was purchased from
Innovative Research of America (Sarasota, FL).

RNA interference
Pin1 shRNA (5′-CCACCGTCACACAGTATTTAT-3′)
was previously described [34]. To establish stable Pin1
knockdown cell lines, Huh7 and HepG2 cells were
infected with lentiviruses expressing Pin1 shRNA. Stably
knockdown cells were selected with 0.5 mg/mL puromycin.

Cell death assay
pI/Hoechst double staining followed by microscopy
was performed as previously described [35, 36]. Briefly,
HCC cells were treated as indicated and stained with
5 ug/mL pI and 5ug/mL Hoechst 33342, examined under
fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axio Observer A1).
pI positive cells were considered dead or late apoptotic
cells, whereas Hoechst 33342 positive cells were blue
and considered normal or early apoptotic cells. pI or
Hoechst33342 positive cells were counted using Image
pro plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, MD, USA), respectively.
pI staining followed by flow cytometry was
conducted as previously described [44]. Briefly, HCC
cells were treated as indicated and stained with pI
alone. pI incorporation and cell size were quantified by
flow cytometry. pI negative cells with normal size were
considered as live cells. pI positive cells with smaller size
were considered as dead cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
HCC cell lines HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B and PLC/
PRF/5 cells were obtained from Cell Bank of Chinese
Academy of Sciences. HepG2 and Huh7 cells were
cultured in high glucose DMEM (#12800017; GIBCO),
while Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5 cells were cultured in
MEM (#SH30024.01; Hyclone). All medium were
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (#10437028; GIBCO) and 100mg/mL streptomycin and 100U/mL
penicillin (#SV30010; Hyclone). Cells were incubated
in 37 degree with 5% CO2. Sorafenib were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (#sc-220125, Santa
Cruz, CA) and Medchemexpress (#HY-10201, Shanghai,
China). Antibodies were obtained from the following
sources. Pin1 antibodies were previously described
[63]. GAPDH (#HC301-02), beta-actin (#HC201-02),
beta-tubulin (#HC101-02) were from Transgen (Beijing,
China). Fbwx7(#55290-1-AP), Mcl-1 (#16225-1-AP)
and survivin (#10508-1-AP) antibodies were purchased
from Proteintech (Wuhan, China). Bax (#5023S),
Phospho-Rb(Ser807/811) (#D20B12) and phosphoAMPKa(Thr172) (#2535P) antibodies were from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Caspase 3 (#PA523921) and Cleaved caspase 9 (#PA5-17913) antibodies
were from ThermoFisher Scientific (Rockford, IL). ATRA
(#R2625), MG132 (#C2211), propidium iodide (#P4170)
and Hoechst33342 (B2261) were obtained from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO). Cell counting Kt-8 (CCK-8) was from
were from Transgen (Beijing, China). CellTiter-Glo®
Luminescent Cell Via- bility Assay Kit was from Promega
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ATP assay
Equal volume of reagents from CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit was directly added to
media. Record luminescence at Microplate Luminometer
(Orion-L2) from BERTHORD, Germany.

CCK8 assay
10 µL of CCK8 was added into 90 ml of media. Cells
were then incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for one hour.
Measure the absorbance using Multiscan GO from Thermo
Scientific at 460 nm. The reference wavelength was 600 nm.

Animal models
All animal protocols were approved by Experimental
Animal Ethics Committee of Fujian Medical University.
BALB/c nude mice were maintained in specific-pathogenfree Laboratory Animal Center of Fujian Medical
University.
For tumor implantation, 2.5*106 Huh7 cells were
inoculated subcutaneously onto the left and right flank
region of ~6 week old nude mice. Tumor volume was

measured every three days and calculated by the formula:
Length*width*width/2.
For ATRA treatment, one-fourth pellet of 10 mg
ATRA with slowing releasing formula for 21 days was
embedded under the neck skin. For sorafenib treatment,
40 mg/kg sorafenib was given every three days by oral
gavage.
