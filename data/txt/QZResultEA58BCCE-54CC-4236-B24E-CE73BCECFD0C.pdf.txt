ABSTRACT:
Azacitidine is the leading compound to treat patients suffering myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) or AML with less than 30% of blasts, but a majority of patients
is primary refractory or rapidly relapses under treatment. These patients have a
drastically reduced life expectancy as compared to sensitive patients. Therefore
identifying predictive factors for AZA resistance is of great interest to propose
alternative therapeutic strategies for non-responsive patients. We generated
AZA-resistant myeloid cell line (SKM1-R) that exhibited increased expression of
BCL2L10 an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member. Importantly, BCL2L10 knockdown
sensitized SKM1-R cells to AZA effect suggesting that increased BCL2L10 expression
is linked to AZA resistance in SKM1-R. We next established in 77 MDS patients that
resistance to AZA is significantly correlated with the percentage of MDS or AML
cells expressing BCL2L10. In addition, we showed that the proportion of BCL2L10
positive bone marrow cells can predict overall survival in MDS or AML patients. We
propose a convenient assay in which the percentage of BCL2L10 expressing cells
as assessed by flow cytometry is predictive of whether or not a patient will become
resistant to AZA. Therefore, systematic determination of BCL2L10 expression
could be of great interest in newly diagnosed and AZA-treated MDS patients.

INTRODUCTION

abnormalities and certain clinical features to stratify
patients with MDS into risk groups[4]. Thus, update of
prognostic scoring is mainly based on new cytogenetic
subgroups[5]. Cytogenetic findings can predict and are
prognostic for overall survival (OS) in patients treated
with hypomethylating agents[6, 7] but are relatively
poor predictors of response[8]. Half of patients with
MDS exhibit a normal karyotype, and patients with
identical chromosomal abnormalities are often clinically

Azacitidine (AZA) is a hypomethylating agent
approved for the treatment of patients suffering
myelodysplastic syndromes[1] (MDS) and acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) with low (20–30%) bone
marrow blast counts in USA, Europe and other countries
yielding 40–60% response in this disease[2, 3].

heterogeneous[5, 9]. Somatic point mutations are
common in MDS. Mutations in TP53, EZH2, ETV6,
RUNX1, DNMT3A and ASXL1 are predictors of poor OS
in patients with MDS independently of other established
risk factors[9-11]. Genetic alterations of the major splicing
components including SF3B1 have been also reported in
MDS[12-14]. However, prognostic impact depending on
the treatment of all these mutations was not evaluated in
this cohort of patients. To date, only mutations in TET2
have been identified as genetic predictors of response to
AZA[15].
MDS or AML patients treated with AZA are
either primary refractory (AZA-resistant) or AZAsensitive but systematically relapse upon treatment with
various time lapses[2]. Globally, only 17% of complete
remission is observed with AZA treatment. Presence of
partial remission and stable disease with hematologic
improvement showed an increasing of OS in MDS or AML
patients treated by AZA. Therefore, relapse or refractory
patients are defined by presence of progression or stable
disease without hematologic improvement according to
IWG 2006 criteria. Outcome of MDS patient after AZA
treatment failure is poor with a median overall survival
of 5.6 months[16]. Importantly, no consensus genetic
predictor of response to AZA or relapse after initial AZA
sensitivity has been reported so far. Therefore, it seems
of great importance to identify as early as possible those
MDS patients treated by hypomethylating agents that will
relapse inexorably in order to propose other clinical trials
before worsening of clinical conditions.
We recently generated AZA-resistant SKM1 myeloid
cells following long-term incubation with increasing

concentrations of AZA. These cells exhibited impaired
apoptosis in response to AZA[17]. In the present study,
taking opportunity of the availability of this cell line
model, we identify a new potential prognostic factor for
the response to AZA in MDS. Indeed, we show for the
first time that protein expression of BCL2L10, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl2 family is increased and
correlated with AZA resistance in the AZA-resistant
SKM1 cell line and that the percentage of BCL2L10
positive cells MDS primary sample patients can predict
AZA resistance. We propose that systematic determination
of the percentage of BCL2L10 positive cells by flow
cytometry could be of great interest before treating MDS
or AML patients with AZA. Moreover, evaluation of an
increase in the proportion of BCL2L10 positive MDS cells
could be also interesting in the course of AZA treatment.

RESULTS
Validation of a flow cytometry-based assay for
BCL2L10 detection
We recently generated AZA-resistant SKM1 cells
(SKM1-R) defective for AZA-induced apoptosis[17].
Compared to their AZA-sensitive counterpart SKM1-R
cells exhibited increased protein expression of BCL2L10
(Bcl-B), an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family
but equivalent levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 proteins
(Figure 1). Increased BCL2L10 protein expression was
also found in the SKM1-R bulk before limited dilution

and also in another SKM1-R subclone (not shown),
indicating that overexpression of BCL2L10 is linked
to AZA resistance and is not due to a clonal effect. To
analyze BCL2L10 protein expression, we developed a
cytometry-based assay in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells
were first transfected with a tagged-Myc construct as a
negative control or a tagged-Myc-BCL2L10 construct

and transfection efficiency was assessed using an antiBCL2L10 antibody. Endogenous BCL2L10 protein was
detected in HEK293 cells transfected with the taggedMyc construct (Figure S1A, curve 2) whereas a stronger
staining was visualized in HEK293 cells overexpressing
BCL2L10 as expected (Figure S1A, curve 3). BCL2L10
protein overexpression was confirmed by western blot

using an anti-BCL2L10 mAb (Figure S1B). To validate the
flow cytometry assay, we next used a specific BCL2L10
siRNA to knockdown BCL2L10 expression in HEK293
cells (Figure S1C). In this condition and conversely to the

situation in which a control Luc siRNA was used (Figure
S1C, curve 1), neither BCL2L10 protein expression nor
BCL2L10 staining were detected by flow cytometry
(Figure S1C, curve 2) and western blot (Figure S1D)

Figure 3: BCL2L10 knockdown sensitizes SKM1-R to the effect of AZA. SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells were transfected with

either control Luc, BCL2L10 or a Bcl-2 siRNAs. 72h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 1µM AZA. (A) Cell metabolism was
assessed 24h later using the XTT assay as described in the material and methods section. Results represent the mean ± SEM of three

24h after the addition of 1µM AZA. (D) Western Blots were also carried out at the same time to assess BCL2L10 and Bcl-2 expression.

in SKM1-R cells as judged by RT-PCR (Figure 2B) and
western blot (Figure 2C).
To determine whether BCL2L10 overexpression
is the cause rather than a consequence of resistance to
AZA, SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells were transfected
with either a control siRNA or a siRNA directed against
BCL2L10 and next treated for 24 h with or without AZA,
before determination of cell viability and apoptosis. AZA
triggered a loss of cell metabolism in SKM1-S but not
in SKM1-R cells (Figure 3A), as expected. Knockdown
of BCL2L10 restored sensitivity to AZA in SKM1-R
suggesting an important role for BCL2L10 in resistance

Overexpression of BCL2L10 participates to AZA
resistance in SKM1 cells
Using the same assay, we established that
significantly more SKM1-R cells expressed BCL2L10
protein compared to SKM1-S (73% versus 39%) and that
globally BCL2L10 expression was increased in SKM1-R
cells (Figure 2A). An increased expression of both
BCL2L10 mRNA and protein levels was also detected

Figure 4: BCL2L10 protein expression is increased in AZA-resistant patients. BCL2L10, Bcl-2 and ERK expression was
analyzed by Western Blot on fresh bone marrow samples prepared from 7 healthy subjects, 7 AZA-sensitive and 5 AZA-resistant patients.

to AZA. For an unknown reason cell metabolism was
higher in SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells treated with the
BCL2L10 siRNA (Figure 3A). In addition, apoptosis was
the main mechanism by which BCL2L10 knockdown
mediated sensitization to AZA since both an increase in
active caspase 3 and PI positive cells were detected in
SKM1-R treated with a BCL2L10 siRNA (Figure 3B
and C). This effect was specific for BCL2L10 because a
siRNA directed against Bcl-2 failed to do so in identical
conditions (Figure 3B and C). Of note, it should be pointed

out that SKM1-R had higher active caspase 3 levels than
their SKM1-S counterpart (Figure 3B and C). Finally we
checked by western blotting that both siRNAs were able
to abolish expression of their respective targets (Figure
3D). Collectively, our findings established that BCL2L10
protein overexpression is responsible for AZA resistance
in SKM1-R cells.

patients under AZA treatment (right panel).

BCL2L10 expression is predictive of resistance to
AZA in MDS patients

and the percentage of BCL2L10 positive cells. After 9
cycles of AZA, patient #23 was sensitive to AZA, had
12% blasts (RAEB-II in the MDS classification) and
40% BCL2L10 positive cells (Figure S2A). This patient
remains sensitive after 12 and 15 cycles of AZA. When
this patient became resistant after 18 cycles of AZA, its
blast counts and BCL2L10 positivity increased to 35% and
90%, respectively. These results suggest that BCL2L10
expression is a hallmark of resistance to AZA. In contrast,
patient #4 who remained sensitive to AZA all along the
treatment (over 29 cycles), failed to exhibit any increase
in blast counts and in the number of BCL2L10 positive
cells (Figure S2B).

We also analyzed BCL2L10 expression by western
blot on patient samples, when sufficient material was
available. Results presented on Figure 4 revealed that the
level of BCL2L10 tends to be higher in two representative
AZA-resistant patients as compared to two representative
AZA-sensitive or healthy patients (Figure 4A). Using
ERK protein as an internal control for each patient sample,
we showed that BCL2L10 versus ERK protein expression
was drastically higher in 5 AZA-resistant versus 7 AZAsensitive patients, whereas the level of BCL2L10 versus
ERK protein expression was very low in 7 healthy subjects
(Figure 4B). Conversely, Bcl-2 protein expression was
not significantly different in the three groups of patients
(Figure 4C). Collectively, these results suggest that
BCL2L10 expression is predictive of AZA-resistance in
MDS patients.

The percentage of BCL2L10 positive cells predicts
OS in MDS and AML patients
We established that a cut-off of 50% BCL2L10
positive cells discriminates well between AZA-sensitive
and resistant patients. Using this cut-off and the patients
from cohort 1, we established that the test had excellent
positive and negative predictive values. Globally, the
test sensitivity and specificity was 80% and 85%. With a
median follow-up of 4 months (range, 0.1 to 7.5 months)
from the date of quantification of BCL2L10 positive
cells, OS was significantly better in patients of cohort
1 exhibiting low percentage of BCL2L10 positive cells
versus patients exhibiting high percentage of BCL2L10
positive (p=0.0016) (Figure 6). Estimated 3-month OS
was 95% versus 51% in the subgroup of patients with low
percentage of BCL2L10 positive cells compared to the
subgroup of patients with high percentage of BCL2L10
positive cells, respectively. Importantly, all patients with
a high percentage of BCL2L10 positive cells progressed
rapidly. Among them four died and two others were treated
with intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic
stem cell transplantation. In the subgroup of patients
exhibiting low percentage of BCL2L10 positive cells, one
patient died of sepsis, and all others patients remained
AZA sensitive according to the IWG 2006 or AML2003
criteria. Among these patients, 7 had a stable disease with
hematologic improvement, 5 had a partial response and
11 patients had a complete response. The relative risk of
this test using a cutoff of 50% BCL2L10 positive cells was
estimated 11.5.

BCL2L10 protein expression as a biomarker of
AZA resistance in MDS patients
We next determined the percentage of BCL2L10
positive cells in freshly isolated bone marrow (BM)
samples from 8 healthy subjects, 24 AZA-sensitive
patients and 8 AZA-resistant patients (Cohort 1, fresh
samples) using our cytometry-based assay. The clinical
features of all patients are given in supplemental Table S1
and S2. As shown on Figure 5A the mean values for freshly
isolated BM samples from healthy subjects and AZAsensitive patients were respectively 0% (0-18) and 8%
(0-40) BCL2L10 positive cells, whereas the mean value
for BM cells from AZA-resistant patients was 85% (5799) BCL2L10 positive cells (p<0.0001) (Figure 5A). In
a second cohort (cohort 2 / frozen samples), retrospective
comparison of BM samples from low risk MDS patients
(n=14), AZA-sensitive (n=21) or AZA-resistant patients
(n=10) showed that the counts of BCL2L10 positive
cells of low risk MDS patients was 0% (0-11), whereas
AZA-resistant patients had significantly higher numbers
of BCL2L10 positive cells as compared to AZA-sensitive
patients (33% versus 10%, p<0.0001) (Figure 5B).
In addition, we performed subgroups analysis from
the 21 AZA-sensitive patients and the 10 AZA-resistant
patients from cohort 2 (Figure 5B). AZA-primary resistant
patients (n=6) had significantly higher counts of BCL2L10
positive cells (29%) than AZA-sensitive patients at
diagnosis (10%) (n=6) (Figure 5C, left panel) (p=0.023).
AZA-sensitive patients at relapse (n=4) exhibited high
counts of BCL2L10 positive cells (43%), as compared
to AZA-sensitive patients (n=11) under treatment (14%)
(Figure 5C, right panel) (p=0.0002).
Finally, we analyzed in two patients (#4) and
(#23), the parallel evolution of bone marrow blast counts

DISCUSSION
BCL2L10 is a member of the Bcl-2 family that
exhibits potent anti-apoptotic activity in vitro. Accordingly,
BCL2L10 shares with the Bcl-2 protein family the wellconserved BH4, BH1 and BH2 domains and lack the BH3
domain that is characteristic of pro-apoptotic members
of the Bcl2 family[25, 26]. BCL2L10 can interact with
other members of the Bcl-2 family including Bcl-2, Bcl496

xL and Bax to regulate apoptosis in different contexts[25,
27, 28]. Accordingly to its anti-apoptotic function,
overexpression of BCL2L10 has been reported to suppress
apoptosis through inhibition of cytochrome C release from
mitochondria[26].
In a recent report, Fabiani et al reported that
Decitabine another hypomethylating agent triggers
apoptosis and up-regulation of several genes including
BCL2L10[29]. Moreover, in primary samples from
patients they found that BCL2L10 promoter was
methylated in approximatively one-half AML and related
myeloid neoplasms, 13% of MDS samples and in none
of the controls. In a more recent report the same group
showed that a higher methylation rate of BCL2L10 was
significantly associated to worse OS in patients enrolled
into the GIMEMA MDS0205 multicenter trial. This was
confirmed in a group of 27 HR-MDS patients, treated with
AZA. Patients with high BCL2L10 promoter methylation
status had also a lower probability of achieving complete
responses. However, in both study the authors did not
study the relation between methylation of the BCL2L10
promoter and modulation of expression of its mRNA
or protein level[30]. Of note, in gastric cancer cells
methylation of the BCL2L10 promoter seems to correlate
with decreased expression of BCL2L10 protein level
[31, 32]. Taking into account the discrepancies reported
regarding the impact of BCL2L10 promoter methylation
status, it appears of great interest to consider its protein

rather than its mRNA expression, in agreement with a
recent report by Beverly et al. [33].
When we looked for BCL2L10 protein expression
either by Western Blot or using our cytometry-based assay,
expression of BCL2L10 was correlated with resistance
to AZA in vitro. Importantly, knockdown of BCL2L10
but not Bcl2 by specific siRNA sensitized SKM1-R to
AZA-mediated apoptosis clearly demonstrating an antiapoptotic role for BCL2L10 in our cellular model. This
was expected taking into account the structural homology
of BCL2L10 with anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl2
family and the known anti-apoptotic function of this
protein. Our results are in very good agreement with two
studies in the literature that linked resistance of cancer cell
lines established from solid tumor and myeloid leukemia
to various chemotherapeutic agents and overexpression of
BCL2L10 both at the mRNA and protein level [34, 35].
In addition, it has been recently reported that BCL2L10
expression was increased in patients with Multiple
Myeloma (MM)[36]. In MM, BCL2L10 overexpression
is clearly associated with apoptosis inhibition since
BCL2L10 knockdown by specific siRNA or targeting
BCL2L10 function by a small peptidomimetic consistently
increased cell death[19], in good agreement with our own
findings.
Importantly, we also establish in the present study
that the number of BCL2L10 positive cells in the bone
marrow is predictive of AZA resistance. Moreover, the

percentage of BCL2L10 expressing BM cells from either
healthy subjects or low-risk MDS patients was very low,
conversely to the one of AZA-R patients. We confirmed by
Western Blot that increased expression of BCL2L10 was a
hallmark of AZA-resistant patients even though BCL2L10
expression and BCL2L10 positive cell counts were
variable from one resistant patient to another. Collectively,
our findings are consistent with an anti-apoptotic role of
BCL2L10 in MDS that impacts on the sensitivity to AZA.
In this line, over-expression of BCL2L10 positive cells not
only correlates with resistance to AZA in vitro but is also
a predictive factor for resistance to AZA in MDS patients.
Finally, we also established using Kaplan-Meier
representation that OS of patients with less than 50%
of BCL2L10 positive cells in the bone marrow was
significantly higher than that of patients with more
than 50% BCL2L10 positive cells. This test was highly
sensitive and highly predictive for the outcome of patients.
Finally, we found that all patients who were initially
sensitive to AZA had lower level of BCL2L10 positive
cells in their BM but consistently increased this number
when they became resistant to this treatment.
In conclusion, we propose a very convenient and
simple flow cytometry-based assay to systematically
quantify BCL2L10 positive cells in the bone marrow of
MDS or AML patients either at diagnosis or during the
normal course of the disease. Patients with more than 50%
BCL2L10 positive cells in the bone marrow at diagnosis
could be considered as not eligible for AZA treatment.
In these patients alternative therapy targeting BCL2L10
should be proposed. In this regard, peptidomimetics
including Gossypol, ApoG and antimycin A which are
potent inhibitor of BCL2L10 should be tested.

Patients Samples
Two cohorts of patients were used for this study. In
Cohort 1, fresh bone marrow samples were collected from
32 patients treated with AZA. All patients had diagnosis
of MDS or AML with less than 30% of blasts and IPSS
scoring intermediate-2 or high. The diagnosis of MDS or
AML was based on standard WHO criteria[23]. Patients
(Pts) were to receive AZA at the FDA/EMEA approved
schedule (75mg/m²/d, 7d/ 4 weeks). Pts having received ≥
1 cycle of AZA and who had bone marrow evaluation after
≥ 4 cycles, or who died or progressed before completion
of 4 cycles were considered evaluable (the last 2 groups
were considered as treatment failures). Responses were
scored according to IWG 2006 criteria for MDS and to
Cheson et al.[24] for AML. Median number of AZA cycles
at evaluation was 10 (3-22). All patients under treatment
with AZA were included in protocol NCT01210274
(www.clinicaltrials.gov). Informed consent was obtained
for all patients. Cohort 2: 45 frozen samples from low-risk
and high-risk MDS or AML patients were collected as part
of an institutionally approved cellular sample collection
protocol. Treatment of patients was the same as the one
described for cohort 1.

Western blot analysis
After stimulation with various effectors for 24
h, cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing
1% Triton X-100 and supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Lysates were
pelleted, and 50 μg of protein were analyzed by SDSPAGE. Blot quantification was performed with Image J
Software.

RNA interference
The si-RNAs used for BCL2L10 and Bcl-2
knockdown have been described previously[19]. Briefly,
cells were transfected with a si-RNA directed against
either BCL2L10, Bcl-2, or Luciferase (Invitrogen,
Villebon sur Yvette, France) (50 nM) using an Amaxa
nucleofector for SKM1 cell lines or using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Villebon sur Yvette, France) for
HEK293 cell line. Seventy-two hours after transfection
AZA-S and AZA-R cells were treated with 1 μM AZA
for 24h. BCL2L10 and Bcl-2 expression were analyzed
by protein gel blot.

Statistical analysis
BCL2L10 protein expression in sensitive and
resistant patients of both cohorts was studied by Student’s
t-test. OS of patients from cohort 1 was measured from the
date of BCL2L10 protein evaluation to either death from
any cause or last follow-up. When patients were treated
with consolidative allogeneic stem cell transplantation,
the data were censored at the date of graft. Survival
functions were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method
and compared by the log-rank test. Differences between
the results of comparative tests were considered significant
if the two-sided P value was less than 0.05. All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS 9.13 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).

Assessment of cell metabolism
Cell metabolism was determined with XTT
assay[20]. Cells (20 x 103 cells) were incubated in a 96well plate for 24h with AZA 1µM at a final volume of 100
μl. After 24h, 50 μl of XTT reagent was added to each
well. The absorbance of the formazan product, reflecting
cell metabolism, was measured at 490 nm. Each assay was
performed in quadruplicate.

Propidium iodide (PI) staining

AUTHORSHIP SECTION

After stimulation with 1µM AZA for 24h, cells were
washed with PBS and stained with propidium iodide.
Fluorescence was measured using the FL3 channel of a
fluorescent-activated cell sorter (Miltenyi cytometer)[21].
