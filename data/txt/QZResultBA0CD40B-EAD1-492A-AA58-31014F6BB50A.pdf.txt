Abstract
The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) 1 can mediate antiproliferative and
proapoptotic effects in cancer cells, and a number of mechanisms have been found whereby STAT1 signaling is attenuated
in tumors thereby increasing their malignant behavior. Thus,
enhancing gene transcription mediated by STAT1 may be
an effective approach to cancer therapy. A high-throughput
screen was developed to identify molecules that could enhance
STAT1-dependent gene expression. Through this approach, it
was found that 2-(1,8-naphthyridin-2-yl)phenol (2-NP) caused a
2-fold increase in STAT1-dependent reporter gene expression
compared with that seen with maximally effective concentrations of IFN-; alone. This effect was specific to STAT1
because 2-NP had no effect on unrelated transcription factors
such as nuclear factor (NF) KB or the highly homologous
transcription factor STAT3. STAT1-dependent gene activation
was enhanced by this compound in a variety of human and
murine cell lines and was independent of the stimulus used.
Furthermore, 2-NP enhanced the expression of the bona fide
endogenous STAT1 target gene interferon regulatory factor 1.
2-NP increased the duration of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation
in response to IFN-;, and this may underlie its enhancement
of STAT1-dependent transcription. Reflecting the fact that
STAT1 can exert tumor-suppressive effects, 2-NP enhanced the
ability of IFN-; to inhibit the proliferation of human breast
cancer and fibrosarcoma cells. Tumor cells lacking STAT1 were
unaffected by either IFN-; or 2-NP. These findings indicate
that enhancement of STAT1 transcriptional activity may have
utility in anticancer therapies, and that cell-based screens
for modulators of transcription factor function can be a useful
approach for drug discovery. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1254–61]

Introduction
The signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)
family of transcription factors transduce signals generated by a
wide variety of extracellular stimuli. As such, they play a critical role
in the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation in
nearly all tissue types (1, 2). Reflecting the central position they play
in these processes, inappropriate STAT function has been found in
a wide array of human tumors (3, 4). Constitutive activation of
STATs, most often STAT3 or STAT5, is a particularly common

finding. However, increasing evidence has implicated the loss of
function of another STAT family member, STAT1, in tumorigenesis.
Whereas many STAT3 target genes promote cell cycle progression
(5, 6), STAT1 mediates the expression of inhibitors of cyclindependent kinases (7) and represses genes necessary for cell cycle
entry (8). Similarly, STAT3 and STAT5 enhance expression of
prosurvival genes, whereas STAT1 can repress these genes (9) and
trigger apoptosis (10, 11). Furthermore, STAT1 may be important in
mediating the therapeutic effect of biological therapies for
leukemia (12) and the induced differentiation of leukemia cells (13).
STAT1 may be particularly important in mediating antitumor
effects of IFN-g. In addition to inhibiting proliferation and survival,
IFN-g enhances the immunogenicity of tumor cells in part through
enhancing STAT1-dependent expression of MHC proteins (14). This
is likely of physiologic importance in that a loss of IFN-g
responsiveness eliminates the immune clearance of tumors in
mice (15, 16). A critical role for STAT1 has also been found in the
response of human cancer cells to IFN-h, in which the induction of
the proapoptotic mediator tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand requires STAT1 (17). In addition, STAT1
seems to be a key negative regulator of angiogenesis (18), and loss
of STAT1 enhances metastasis and angiogenesis in murine systems
(19). Reflecting the important role that this pathway plays in
suppressing tumorigenesis, the loss of the ability to activate STAT1
via the IFN receptor has been found to occur in lung cancer (15)
and prostate cancer (20). Conversely, increased phosphorylation
and DNA binding activity of STAT1 is associated with decreased
relapse and increased survival in patients with newly diagnosed
breast cancer (21). The function of this transcription factor may be
particularly important in patients receiving chemotherapy because
STAT1 activation seems to be an important element in the killing
of tumor cells in response to cytotoxic agents (22).
Given this central role that STAT1 plays in suppressing
neoplastic behavior, an attractive therapeutic strategy is to enhance
the gene activation events mediated by STAT1. To do this, a cellbased high-throughput screening system was developed to identify
small organic molecules that enhance STAT1-dependent gene
activation. Using this system, we identified a compound, 2-(1,8naphthyridin-2-yl)phenol (2-NP), that enhances gene activation
mediated by STAT1 over that seen with maximally efficacious
concentration of IFN-g and other cytokines. Furthermore, 2-NP
accentuates the antiproliferative effects of IFN-g on cancer cells
in vitro, suggesting that modulation of the transcription factor
function may be a useful new strategy in the treatment of cancer.

supplemented with 10% FCS at 37jC in 95% air and 5% CO2. Cell viability
assays were done in duplicate using CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Madison, WI)
to measure the luminescent output from the ATP present in viable cells.
To generate a cell-based system by which STAT1-dependent gene
activation could be quantitated, a plasmid was constructed in which a
firefly luciferase gene was placed under the control of a STAT-dependent
promoter sequence. A neomycin phosphotransferase cassette was also
introduced, and this plasmid was then transfected into NIH3T3 cells
using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were selected
in G418 (500 Ag/mL), and stable colonies of these STAT-luc/3T3 cells
were picked and expanded. Clones were then assessed for low basal
luciferase activity and prominent induction following treatment with
IFN-g. Several such clones were expanded and used for subsequent
experiments. As controls, parallel cell lines were generated in which
luciferase was under the control of a NFnB-responsive promoter (NFnBluc/3T3 cells) or constitutively expressed by a cytomegalovirus promoter
(CMV-luc/3T3).
For transient transfections, a STAT-responsive firefly luciferase reporter
was introduced along with a Renilla luciferase expression plasmid under the
control of a thymidine kinase promoter (Promega) using LipofectAMINE
2000 (24). Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were untreated or
treated with 2-NP for 1 h, then treated with the indicated cytokine. Five
hours later, cells were lysed, and relative luminescence was measured on a
Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (ThermoLab Systems, Helsinki, Finland)
using a dual-luciferase system (Promega). STAT-dependent luciferase
production was normalized to the values from the control Renilla luciferase
expression plasmid.
Screening for STAT1 modulators. For high-throughput screening, 4,000
STAT-luc/3T3 cells were plated in 30 AL per well in a 384-well plate. After
being allowed to adhere overnight, 0.1 AL of compounds from the Peakdale
Library (Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA) were added to the plates using pin transfer. The compounds
were stored in 100% DMSO, and thus, the final concentration of DMSO was
0.3%, a concentration we found had no effect on basal or induced luciferase
expression in these cells. After incubation for 1 h, cells were then treated
with IFN-g (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) to a final concentration of
10 ng/mL. Five hours later, luciferase was quantitated using the Bright Glo
Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega). For the NFnB-responsive cells, following
incubation with compounds, NFnB-luc/3T3 cells were treated with TNF-a
(R&D Systems; 10 ng/mL).
RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). RNA of 2 Ag was reverse transcribed with a poly-dT primer
using the SuperScript First-Strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR
was then done with a SYBR Green master mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) on
an ABI Prism 7500 instrument. The primer pairs used were murine
interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1, 5¶-CGTTGTGCCATGAACTCCCTGC-3¶
and 5¶-GCTCTTAGTGTCTCGGCTGG-3¶; and murine glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase, 5¶-CAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCAGG-3¶ and 5¶CTCTTGCTCAGTGTCCTTGC-3¶.
Western blotting. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% NP40, 0.25% sodium
deoxycholate, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Ag/mL pepstatin, and 1 mmol/L sodium
orthovanadate. For Western blot analysis, 40 Ag of protein were resolved
on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated with antibodies that recognize the tyrosine
phosphorylated form of STAT1 (1:10,000; ref. 25), the serine phosphorylated
form of STAT1 (1:10,000; ref. 26), total STAT1 (1:20,000; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, SC-346), the tyrosine phosphorylated form
of STAT3 (1:10,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and total
STAT3 (1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were incubated with
goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies
(Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and detection was done using the Renaissance
chemiluminescent ECL kit (NEN Dupont, Boston, MA). Western blots were
then scanned and analyzed with NIH Image 1.61/ppc. Band densities from
phospho-STAT1 Western blots were normalized to the band intensity from
the total STAT1 Western blots.

Results
Characterization of reporter cell lines. We first validated the
specificity of the reporter cell lines by treating them with potent
and specific activators of either STAT1 (with IFN-g) or NFnB
(with TNF-a). STAT-luc/3T3 cells and NFnB-luc/3T3 cells were
left untreated or treated with IFN-g or TNF-a, and luciferase
activity was determined. Treatment of STAT-luc/3T3 cells with
IFN-g led to a 5-fold induction of luciferase activity (Fig. 1). By
contrast, treatment of these cells with TNF-a caused no significant change in luciferase activity. NFnB-luc/3T3 cells displayed
the opposite response, showing no significant change in luciferase
activity in response to IFN-g, but displaying a 2- to 3-fold
induction in response to TNF-a. Both assays were highly
reproducible and showed little interwell variability. Reflecting
this, the Z¶ factor (27) for the STAT-luc/3T3 system was 0.92, and
for the NFnB-luc/3T3 system, it was 0.81. The characteristics of
these cells remained unchanged over 6 months in culture. Thus,
these cell lines display high sensitivity and specificity as reporters
for activity of each of these pathways.
Screening for enhancers of STAT1 transcriptional activity.
Given the importance of STAT1 as a potential tumor suppressor, the
isolation of small organic molecules that enhance the activity of this
protein would represent a novel approach to cancer therapy that
may complement standard therapies. To identify such molecules,
STAT-luc/3T3 cells were seeded in 384-well plates and then treated
with 5,120 compounds from the Peakdale libraries at a concentration of 16 Ag/mL in a final concentration of 0.3% DMSO. The
Peakdale compounds are characterized by their structural diversity.
They display appropriate molecular weight and lipophilicity for cellpermeable drugs, and they lack functional groups likely to cause
toxicity or instability. After 1 h, cells were stimulated with IFN-g,
and 5 h later, luciferase activity was quantitated relative to cells that

had been treated with IFN-g alone. Although the STAT-responsive
promoter used in the STAT-luciferase vector can also respond
to STAT3, when NIH3T3 cells are treated with IFN-g, STAT1 is the
only STAT family member that is activated (data not shown).
From this screen, we identified three compounds that increased
STAT1-dependent luciferase activity by more than 1.5-fold. Among
these, 2-NP (Fig. 2A) was the most efficacious enhancer of STAT1dependent luciferase activity.
2-NP specifically enhances STAT1-dependent gene expression. To determine the effects of 2-NP on STAT1-dependent gene
activation, STAT-luc/3T3 cells were left untreated or pretreated with
increasing concentrations of 2-NP for 1 h, then stimulated with
IFN-g. Luminescence was then quantitated 5 h later. In the absence
of 2-NP, a dose of 10 ng/mL of IFN-g led to a maximal induction of
luciferase activity, 8-fold above baseline. At this concentration of
IFN-g, pretreatment with 2-NP led to a dose-dependent enhancement in STAT1-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). At a dose of
45 Amol/L, 2-NP showed maximal effects, enhancing STAT1dependent luciferase activity by 2.5-fold. 2-NP alone had minimal

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

effects on luciferase expression in STAT-luc/3T3 cells. The DMSO
vehicle had no effect on STAT1-dependent gene expression (data
not shown). Thus, the major effect of 2-NP is to enhance the STAT1dependent transcriptional activity induced by IFN-g.
To exclude the possibility that 2-NP was enhancing luciferase
activity in these cells by a nonspecific mechanism, we tested the
effect of this compound on gene activation mediated by an
independent transcription factor, NFnB. In NFnB-luc/3T3 cells, in
which luciferase is under the control of a NFnB-responsive promoter,
TNF-a treatment led to a 2-fold induction of luciferase activity. In
the presence or absence of TNF-a, 2-NP had no significant effect on
luciferase activity in these cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, in cells in
which luciferase was constitutively expressed, driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter, 2-NP also had no effect on luciferase activity
(Fig. 2D). Thus, 2-NP does not act by nonspecifically increasing
transcription or translation or directly enhancing luciferase
enzymatic activity.
To determine whether 2-NP enhanced STAT1-dependent gene
activation in other cell types, we transiently transfected the STAT-luc

reporter plasmid into SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells, along with
a plasmid-encoding Renilla luciferase under the control of a
thymidine kinase promoter to serve as a control of transfection
efficiency. In these cells, IFN-g induced a 2.5-fold induction in
normalized luciferase activity (Fig. 3A). Whereas the vehicle DMSO
had no effect on this induction, pretreating the cells for 1 h before
IFN-g treatment led to further 2-fold induction in activity, similar in
magnitude to the enhancement seen in NIH3T3 cells. Similar effects
were seen in MCF-7 cells, indicating that this effect of 2-NP is not cell
type or species restricted (data not shown).
It is known that the STAT reporter construct used can also
confer STAT3 transcriptional control on a reporter gene. We thus
considered the possibility that 2-NP might enhance the activity of
this highly homologous STAT family member. U3A cells, which lack
STAT1, were stably transfected with the STAT-luc construct.
Stimulation of these cells with the cytokine IL-6 (10 ng/mL), which
induces activation solely of STAT3, led to a 5-fold induction in
luciferase activity (Fig. 3B). 2-NP, either alone or in the presence of
IL-6, had no effect on luciferase activity. Thus, 2-NP enhances
STAT1-dependent gene induction, without affecting the function of
STAT3.
2-NP enhances the induction of an endogenous STAT1 target
gene. To facilitate high-throughput screening of STAT1 activators,
we used a heterologous luciferase reporter construct. However,
it was necessary to determine whether 2-NP could enhance the
expression of a bona fide STAT1 target gene in its genomic context.
To address this question, NIH3T3 cells were treated with vehicle
alone or with 2-NP for 1 h, after which they were stimulated with
IFN-g for 30 min. RNA was harvested, and the expression of IRF-1,
a well-validated STAT1 target gene, was determined by quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR. (Fig. 4). A maximally effective concentration of IFN-g alone led to a 13-fold induction in IRF-1 mRNA.
Preincubation with 2-NP increased the magnitude of induction of
IRF-1 to 25-fold over basal levels. Thus, in addition to enhancing
the expression of model STAT1-responsive genes, 2-NP enhances
the expression of endogenous STAT1 target genes.

2-NP leads to the prolongation of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Given the prominent and specific ability of 2-NP to enhance
STAT1-dependent gene activation, we considered the possibility
that 2-NP was enhancing STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. NIH3T3
cells were untreated or incubated with 2-NP and then either left
untreated or stimulated with IFN-g at varying doses or for differing
intervals. Cell extracts were prepared, and the phosphorylation of
STAT1 on tyrosine 701 was determined by Western blotting and
normalized to total STAT1 levels. At an early time point, 30 min,
2-NP had little effect on STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced
by IFN-g over a range of concentrations (Fig. 5A). IFN-g–induced
STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation is usually rapid and transient,
returning toward baseline after 2 to 4 h. However, when cells were
pretreated with 2-NP, STAT1 phosphorylation remained elevated for
up to 4 h (Fig. 5B). No changes in STAT1 serine phosphorylation
were noted (data not shown). To examine whether 2-NP also
prolonged the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, U3A cells were
incubated with 2-NP or the DMSO vehicle, and then stimulated with
IL-6 (10 ng/mL). Cell extracts were prepared over a 4-h time span,
and Western blots were done for STAT3 phosphorylated on tyrosine
705 and for total STAT3 (Fig. 5C). No difference was seen in the
magnitude or kinetics of STAT3 phosphorylation in the presence of
2-NP. Thus, the ability of 2-NP to specifically enhance STAT1dependent gene activation may occur by specifically prolonging the
tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1.
2-NP accentuates the antiproliferative effects of IFN-; on
cancer cells. The rationale for developing STAT1 enhancers was
based on evidence that STAT1 plays an important role in
suppressing tumorigenesis. To determine whether 2-NP could
enhance an antitumor effect mediated by STAT1, we examined the
effect of 2-NP on the cytostatic effect of IFN-g on the human breast
cancer cell line MCF-7. IFN-g alone leads to a modest but
reproducible dose-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 cell proliferation
with a maximal effect of 12% inhibition at a concentration of
5 Ag/mL (Fig. 6A). 2-NP alone had minimal effects on MCF-7
proliferation, indicating that it does not have nonspecific toxic or

cytostatic effects. However, the addition of 2-NP to IFN-gled to a
4-fold enhancement in the inhibition of proliferation. Thus, the
STAT1 enhancer 2-NP can accentuate the growth-inhibitory effects
induced by IFN-g.
To confirm that this growth-inhibitory effect of 2-NP was STAT1
dependent, we used the human fibrosarcoma cell line 2fTGH. A
variant of this cell line, U3A, was derived that lacks STAT1 (23).
Similar to MCF-7 cells, IFN-g causes a modest reduction in
proliferation, which is accentuated by 2-NP (Fig. 6B). Interestingly,
2-NP alone also causes some reduction in proliferation of these cells,
perhaps through the enhancement of low-level basal STAT1
activation (28). However, neither IFN-gnor 2-NP showed any effect
on the proliferation of the isogenic U3A cells lacking STAT1 (Fig. 6C).
Thus, 2-NP does not cause nonspecific toxicity and exhibits growthinhibitory activity only in the presence of functional STAT1.

Discussion
Most therapeutic approaches to advanced cancers rely on
cytotoxic agents that induce cell death in a nonspecific manner.
As a result, these agents induce significant toxicity and exhibit a
low therapeutic index. It would be beneficial if the next generation
of anticancer therapies made use of specific molecular pathways

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

that can be used to inhibit the malignant behavior of tumor cells.
One such target is STAT1, which exhibits properties of a tumor
suppressor. This transcription factor can mediate cell cycle arrest,
enhanced apoptosis, and therapeutic differentiation and, thus, may
suppress tumorigenicity by a number of means. Furthermore,
STAT1 can be activated by IFNs, cytokines that have been used
therapeutically for many years for a variety of malignant, infectious,
and autoimmune diseases with minimal toxicity.
In considering how to enhance STAT1-dependent gene expression, several strategies can be envisioned. One approach is to focus
on pathways that down-regulate STAT1 function and to develop
small molecules that inhibit their function using structure-based
drug design. Such targets might include phosphatases that mediate
STAT1 dephosphorylation (29, 30), pathways leading to STAT1
degradation (31), or members of the suppressors of cytokine
signaling family that dampen the activation of STAT1 (32). We
decided to take an open-ended approach based on a cell-based
screening assay in which STAT1-dependent gene activation could
be detected in a high-throughput fashion by measuring the activity
of a reporter gene. This strategy has the advantage that active
compounds must be cell permeable or otherwise able to reach their
cellular targets, and that molecules displaying nonspecific toxicity
are rapidly excluded. Furthermore, it allows the identification of
active compounds independent of a predetermined mechanism of
action. This provides the ability to find compounds that may
function by a variety of mechanisms and may reveal levels of
functional regulation that might not have been previously
appreciated.
Using this approach to identify molecules that could enhance
STAT1-dependent gene activation over that seen with maximally
active concentrations of IFN-g, we screened 5,120 compounds. The
compounds were tested at a single concentration of 16 Ag/mL, f30
to 50 Amol/L for most of these molecules. This concentration was
known to be nontoxic for nearly all of the compounds, and at this
relatively high concentration, it was thought to be less likely that an
active agent would be missed. Thus, this single concentration was
used to minimize the costs of the screen. However, screening at a
single concentration does increase the chance of false negative
results, for example, of a compound displaying an ‘‘inverted U’’ doseresponse curve.
From this screen, 2-NP was found to induce the greatest increase
in STAT1-dependent luciferase expression. 2-NP not only enhanced
the expression of a STAT1-responsive reporter gene, but it also
increased the expression of an endogenous STAT1 target gene, and
it accentuated the STAT1-mediated inhibition of proliferation of
cancer cells. However, 2-NP showed specificity in this effect in that
it had no effect on gene activation mediated by the highly
homologous protein STAT3, or by the unrelated transcription
factor NFnB. Because constitutively active cysteine-containing
STAT1 (and STAT3) mutants seem to work by prolonging STAT
tyrosine phosphorylation (28), we considered the possibility that
2-NP might be mediating a similar effect. At early time points, 2-NP
has a negligible effect at enhancing STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, 2-NP seems to prolong STAT1 phosphorylation, and
its ability to enhance STAT1-dependent gene expression may relate
to this effect. This action may be mediated by inhibiting a STAT1
phosphatase, blocking STAT1 degradation (31) or prolonging the
interaction of STAT1 with its cognate DNA sequence (28, 33).
Because 2-NP does not exert a similar effect on STAT3, elucidating
the mechanism for this effect might uncover distinct aspects of the
regulation of these two homologous transcription factors.

A Small-Molecule Enhancer of STAT1

The enhancement of transcription mediated by 2-NP, both in
reporter gene systems and of the endogenous target IRF-1, is f2fold over that seen with maximally effective concentrations of
cytokines. Although this seems to be a small level of enhancement,
evidence from gene expression microarrays and quantitative
analysis of gene expression indicates that changes in expression
of as little as 1.5-fold may be important in mediating significant
changes in cellular physiology (6). Furthermore, this level of activity
allows a significant enhancement of the growth suppression
mediated by IFN-g in cancer cells. Thus, compounds that can

enhance STAT1-dependent gene activation to this magnitude can
clearly mediate biologically important effects in cellular function.
Maximal activity of 2-NP is seen at concentrations in the low
micromolar range (Fig. 2B). It remains to be determined whether
this potency will be adequate for use in animals with acceptable
toxicity. However, the minimal toxicity exhibited by 2-NP in vitro,
especially in the U3A cells, which lack STAT1, suggests that any
‘‘off-target’’ effects of 2-NP will be limited. Once a specific cellular
target for the STAT1-enhancing effects of 2-NP is identified, the
goal will be to enhance the function of this molecule through

Figure 6. 2-NP enhances the antiproliferative effects of IFN-g on human cancer cells. (A ) MCF-7, (B ) 2fTGH, or (C ) U3A cells lacking STAT1 were preincubated
with 2-NP (45 Amol/L) for 1 h, as indicated. They were then untreated or treated with IFN-g (10 ng/mL) for 48 h, after which, viable cells were quantitated by ATP-based
luminescence. Columns, means of three experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05 by two-sided t test.

structure-activity considerations or to develop other compounds
with similar activity, maximizing potency and minimizing the
likelihood of toxicity or nonspecific effects.
There are several potential medical uses for 2-NP for malignant
and nonmalignant diseases. IFNs are already used in the treatment
of a number of forms of hematopoietic cancers, such as chronic
myelogenous leukemia (34) and hairy cell leukemia (35), as well as
nonhematopoietic cancers, such as melanoma (36) and renal cell
carcinoma (37). Thus, 2-NP might show particular efficacy in
enhancing the activity of IFNs for these diseases. However, STAT1
may be important in mediating endogenous antitumor signals
whether emanating from cytokines released around tumor cells,
such as IFNs, or from cell-cell interactions (38). Thus, enhancing
STAT1-dependent gene activation may be useful even in the
absence of cytokines or other agents that can induce the tyrosine
phosphorylation of this transcription factor. Furthermore, there is
evidence that STAT1 activation is important in mediating cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents (22). Thus, a
STAT1 enhancer such as 2-NP may help increase the efficacy of
conventional anticancer treatments. Finally, STAT1 activation in
endothelial cells may be an important negative regulator of
angiogenesis (18). Thus, 2-NP alone, or in combination with other
agents targeting tumor vasculature, may be important in
optimizing antiangiogenesis treatments.

In addition to the anticancer effects mediated by STAT1,
activation of this transcription factor may play an important role
in a range of non-neoplastic diseases. For example, IFNs, with their
natural roles likely centering on their antiviral effects, are a central
component of the treatment of infectious diseases such as hepatitis
B (39) and hepatitis C (40). In addition, STAT1 activation in immune
cells likely underlies the efficacy of IFNs in autoimmune diseases
such as multiple sclerosis (41). Thus, the ability to specifically
accentuate the biological effects of IFNs may have widespread utility.
In conclusion, using a cell-based screen to isolate compounds that
can modulate STAT1-dependent gene activation, we have identified
2-NP as a selective and efficacious enhancer of STAT1 activity.
Through mechanistic analysis and further preclinical studies, it will
be possible to define the potential clinical uses of compounds with
this activity in both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases.
