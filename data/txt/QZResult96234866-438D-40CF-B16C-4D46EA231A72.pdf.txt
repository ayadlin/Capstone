Abstract
Little preclinical modeling currently exists to support the use of OX40 agonists as therapeutic agents in
the setting of advanced cancers, as well as the mechanisms through which therapeutic efficacy is achieved.
We show that treatment of mice bearing well-established day 17 sarcomas with a novel OX40 ligand–Fc
fusion protein (OX40L-Fc) resulted in tumor regression or dormancy in the majority of treated animals.
Unexpectedly, dendritic cells (DC) in the progressive tumor microenvironment (TME) acquire OX40 expression and bind fluorescently labeled OX40L-Fc. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses revealed that DCs become
enriched in the tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) of both wild-type and Rag−/− mice within 3 days after
OX40L-Fc treatment. By day 7 after treatment, a significant expansion of CXCR3+ T effector cells was noted
in the TDLN, and by day 10 after treatment, type 1 polarized T cells exhibiting a reactivated memory phenotype had accumulated in the tumors. High levels of CXCL9 (a CXCR3 ligand) and enhanced expression of
VCAM-1 by vascular endothelial cells (VEC) were observed in the TME early after treatment with OX40L-Fc.
Notably, these vascular alterations were maintained in Rag−/− mice, indicating that the OX40L-Fc–mediated
activation of both DC and VEC occurs in a T-cell–independent manner. Collectively, these findings support a
paradigm in which the stimulation of DC, T cells, and the tumor vasculature by an OX40 agonist dynamically
orchestrates the activation, expansion, and recruitment of therapeutic T cells into established tumors. Cancer

Introduction
As tumors develop and progress, several regulatory mechanisms are responsible for maintaining immune tolerance
in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Poor tumor homing
and penetration of T effector cells, a consequence of aberrant vasculature and limited chemokine and adhesion
molecule expression in the TME (1, 2), is one major barrier
to antitumor immunity (3). Furthermore, tumor-specific
T cells that effectively infiltrate tumors may be rendered inactive by soluble factors and inhibitory signals associated
with tumor cells and through the negative effect of both
myeloid- and lymphoid-derived suppressor cells (4, 5). Although systemic immunity may be affected to a variable de-

gree, immune suppression is typically most profound within
the TME, with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) exhibiting severe deficiencies in CD8+ T-cell–mediated cytotoxic
function (6). In murine tumor models, TIL dysfunction becomes pronounced only at later stages of solid tumor
growth, at which point a mature tumor stroma composed
of both bone marrow– and non–bone marrow–derived cells
has been established (7, 8).
Given the perceived importance of T-cell–mediated immunity underlying effective immunotherapy (9) and better clinical outcome (3), substantial emphasis has recently been
placed on the development of treatment modalities that are
capable of restoring T-cell function and enhancing tumor
penetration in the tumor-bearing host. In particular, immune-stimulating agents that target the costimulatory tumor
necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family member OX40 have
shown antitumor efficacy in preclinical models (10). Costimulatory members of the TNFR family are upregulated shortly
after T-cell receptor engagement on naive and antigenexperienced cells, where they serve as key modulators of cell
activation, survival, and differentiation (11, 12). OX40 is expressed by activated T effector cells, and OX40-mediated signals provided during priming regulate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell
activation and clonal expansion in vivo (13–15). Furthermore,
anergic or hyporesponsive OX40+ T cells may be reactivated
by OX40 agonists (16). OX40 is also constitutively expressed
by CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg; ref. 17). Indeed, recent studies have shown that agonist signaling through

OX40 inhibits the suppressor function of natural Foxp3+ Treg
(18), prevents the induction of Treg from CD4+ T effector cells
(19), and confers resistance to effector cells against Tregmediated inhibition (13).
To characterize the molecular, cellular, and treatmentassociated consequences of OX40 engagement in the setting
of well-established tumors, a novel agonistic reagent directed against murine OX40 [OX40 ligand–Fc fusion protein
(OX40L-Fc)] was recently constructed and characterized
in vitro (20). We observed that the progressive growth
of well-established day 17 sarcomas was inhibited by a
short course of OX40L-Fc therapy, with complete tumor
regression or extended disease stabilization (i.e., tumor dormancy) observed in the majority of treated animals. Comparable findings were obtained in both the MCA205 (H-2b)
and CMS4 (H-2 d ) sarcoma models. We noted that i.p.
injection of OX40L-Fc induced significant expansion of T
effector cells in the tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN),
resulting in the accumulation of activated, type 1 polarized
T cells in the TME within 10 days of initiating OX40L-Fc therapy. Moreover, our therapy seemed to dynamically affect dendritic cell (DC) and vascular endothelial cells (VEC) in both
wild-type and Rag−/− mice bearing well-established tumors.
The extensive molecular and cellular alterations observed in
this model strongly support the translation of OX40 agonists
into human clinical trials, either as single agents or in the context of combinational immunotherapy (21).

Materials and Methods
Mice
Six- to 10-week-old female C57BL/6 (H-2 b ), B6.129S7Rag1tm1Mom (Rag−/−; H-2b), and BALB/cJ (H-2d) mice were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in
the pathogen-free animal facility in the Biomedical Sciences
Tower at the University of Pittsburgh. All animal work was
done in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Tumor establishment
The MCA205 (H-2b) sarcoma cell line was purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection. The CMS4
(H-2d ) sarcoma has been described in detail previously
(22). Cell lines were cultured in complete media [CM; RPMI
1640 supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin, 10 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (all reagents from Life Technologies)] in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. All cell
lines were negative for known mouse pathogens. Tumors
were established by injection of 5 × 105 tumor cells s.c. into
the right flanks of syngeneic mice, with tumor size assessed
every 3 to 4 days and recorded in mm2. Mice were sacrificed when tumors became ulcerated or reached a maximum size of 400 mm2.
Costimulatory therapy
Tumor-bearing mice were injected i.p. with 100 μg of
OX40L-Fc or rat IgG isotype control antibody (Sigma-

9042

Cancer Res; 70(22) November 15, 2010

Aldrich) in a total volume of 100 μL PBS on days 17 and
20 after tumor inoculation when tumors were approximately
30 to 50 mm2 in size. The mOX40L-Fc fusion protein has
been previously described (20).
Isolation of tumor, lymph node, and spleen cells
Single-cell suspensions were obtained from TDLN as previously described (22). For TIL, tumors were enzymatically
digested with 0.1% (w/v) collagenase, 1% (w/v) hyaluronidase, and 0.1% (w/v) DNase (all from Sigma), with lymphocytes isolated as buoyant cells after discontinuous density
centrifugation as previously described (23).
In vitro stimulation of T cells
Bulk TILs (n = 1 per group) were restimulated in vitro
with irradiated (100 Gy) MCA205 cells for 5 days at a T
cell–to–tumor ratio of 10:1 in CM with 20 units/mL of recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2). Recovered T cells
were then cultured in media alone (to determine background cytokine levels) or with 5 μg/mL anti-CD3 (BioLegend) for 72 hours. Cell-free supernatants were then
harvested and assessed for levels of mIFN-γ using a specific
OptEIA ELISA set (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions with a lower limit of detection of 32.5
pg/mL. Data are reported as the mean ± SD of duplicate
determinations.
Reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from TIL on days 3, 7, and 10
after the initial treatment (day 17 after tumor inoculation),
as indicated, using RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen), according to
the manufacturer's instructions. For semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), TILs were cultured with
5 μg/mL anti-CD3 (BioLegend) for 24 hours, followed by
RNA isolation and cDNA preparation using random hexamer primers (Applied Biosciences). PCR was performed using
the primer pairs listed in Supplementary Table S1. Cycling
times and temperature were as follows: initial denaturation
at 94°C for 2 minutes (1 cycle); denaturation at 94°C for 30
seconds, annealing at 60°C to 65°C for 30 seconds, and elongation at 72°C for 1 minute (35–40 cycles); final extension at
72°C for 5 minutes (1 cycle). Following gel electrophoresis,
PCR products were imaged and band density was quantified using LabWorks software (Perkin-Elmer). For quantitative RT-PCR, reverse transcription and PCR amplification
were performed by the University of Pittsburgh Genomics
and Proteomics Core Laboratories (a shared resource).
For quantitative analysis of T-bet, IFN-γ, and control βactin, previously published primer pairs were used (24),
and cDNA was amplified using SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems). For quantitative analysis of
Foxp3, IL-10, and control β-actin, RT2 qPCR Primer Assays
(SABiosciences) were used and cDNA was amplified using
RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences). For
each sample, the cycle threshold (Ct) values for β-actin gene
were determined for normalization purposes and the ΔCt
values between β-actin and T-bet, Foxp3, IFN-γ, and
IL-10 were calculated. ΔΔC t values were calculated to

isotype treatment samples. Relative RNA expression for
each gene is depicted as 2ΔΔCt.
Confocal immunofluorescence staining and imaging
Tumor tissue was processed and sectioned as previously
reported (22), followed by immunofluorescence staining
and confocal microscopy. The following primary antibodies
were used for staining sections: rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD
Biosciences), goat anti-mouse OX40 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rat anti-mouse OX40 (eBioscience), hamster anti-mouse
CD11c (BD Biosciences), rat anti-mouse VCAM-1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and goat anti-mouse CXCL9 (R&D Systems).
The following secondary antibodies were used: donkey antirat Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes), donkey anti-goat Cy3
(Jackson ImmunoResearch), donkey anti-hamster Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes), donkey anti-rat Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), goat anti-rat Fab1 fragment Cy3 (Jackson
ImmunoResearch), and goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). All sections were briefly incubated with 4′,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) and then mounted.
Images were acquired using an Olympus FluoView 1000
confocal microscope (Olympus). Isotype control and specific
antibody images were taken using the same level of exposure
on the channel settings.
Flow cytometry
Before all stainings, cells were Fc blocked with antiCD16/CD32 (Becton Dickinson). Single-cell suspensions
were stained using the following antibodies: PerCP- and
PE-conjugated CD4 and CD8, PE-conjugated Gr-1, FITCconjugated CD80 and CD25, and PerCP-Cy5.5–conjugated
Ki67 (all Becton Dickinson); FITC-conjugated CD27, Class
II and F4/80, PE-conjugated CCR7 and OX40, and APCconjugated CD11c, CD44, CXCR3, and CD11b (all
eBioscience); or appropriate-matched, fluorochrome-labeled
isotype control monoclonal antibody (mAb). For Foxp3 intracellular staining, CD4+ T cells were surface stained as
described above and then further processed using an
APC anti-mouse/rat Foxp3 Staining kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. FITC conjugation of OX40L-Fc was performed using a FITC protein
labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Cells were analyzed using
an LSR II flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter), with corollary
data assessed using FlowJo software (version 7.6.1; Tree
Star, Inc.).
Statistical analysis
All comparisons of intergroup means were performed
using a two-tailed Student's t test, with P < 0.05 considered
significant.

Results
OX40L-Fc treatment elicits potent antitumor activity
against well-established tumors
A novel OX40 agonist, consisting of mOX40L linked to
the COOH terminus of the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin,

day 5 (H-2d) Colon 26 and RENCA tumor models (20). In
contrast, an agonist anti-OX40 (OX86) mAb was only able
to extend median survival by ∼2 weeks in these models.
To determine whether OX40L-Fc would be efficacious in a
more established and potentially clinically relevant disease
model, we treated H-2b mice bearing day 17 MCA205 sarcomas via i.p. injection of 100 μg of OX40L-Fc or control rat
IgG. A second identical dose was provided 3 days later. Tumors in all control-treated mice grew progressively and exhibited a rapid expansion in size around day 30 after
inoculation, necessitating euthanasia by day 40 (Fig. 1A).
In contrast, OX40L-Fc–treated mice exhibited reduced, stabilized tumor size by day 27 that was durable through day
40. Although OX40L-Fc treatment resulted in the long-term
survival of only 13% of treated animals (Fig. 1B), 50% of this
cohort exhibited small (∼20–40 mm2) lesions that remained
“dormant” for >6 weeks, before eventually progressing.
Growth of representative tumors exhibiting dormancy in
OX40L-Fc–treated mice is shown in Fig. 1C.
Similar therapeutic benefits were observed in the CMS4
(H-2d) sarcoma model, where >80% of animals rejected their
tumors after OX40L-Fc treatment on days 17 and 20 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Despite the superior efficacy observed for
OX40L-Fc in the CMS4 model, all remaining data were collected in the MCA205 tumor model due to the tendency of
progressor CMS4 tumors to ulcerate, necessitating premature euthanasia per Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee regulations.
T-cell and DC expression of OX40 is elevated in the
progressor TME
To identify the in situ cellular targets of OX40L-Fc–
based therapy, we next assessed OX40 expression on T-cell
subsets within the TDLN and the TME of untreated
MCA205 tumor-bearing mice between days 17 and 20 after
tumor inoculation. Whereas OX40 was barely detectable
on CD4+Foxp3− and CD8+ T cells in the TDLN, ∼50% of
CD4+Foxp3+ T cells expressed OX40 (Fig. 2A), consistent
with previous reports indicating that OX40 expression is
restricted to the regulatory subset of resting T cells in
peripheral tissues (13). Conversely, OX40 expression was
upregulated on all T-cell subsets in the untreated TME,
including a median of >20% of CD8+ T cells and >60%
of CD4+Foxp3− T cells.
Because natural killer (NK) and NKT cells can express
OX40 under certain conditions (25, 26), we hypothesized
that non–T-cell subsets may also represent targets for interaction with OX40L-Fc in the progressor TME. Indeed, OX40
expression was highly upregulated on CD11c + CD11b +
ClassIIhi tumor-infiltrating DC (TIDC) when compared with
TDLN-localized DC (median of 37.6% versus 2.3% OX40+, respectively; Fig. 2B). OX40 was also detected on TIDC via
confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, FITC-labeled OX40L-Fc was found to bind to
TIDC, but not to TDLN-localized DC (Fig. 2D). These data
suggest that although CD4+Foxp3+ T cells may represent
the exclusive expressors of OX40 in the periphery, CD4+
Foxp3− and CD8+ T effector cells, as well as DC, contain

100 μg of rat IgG isotype control mAb or OX40L-Fc, as indicated. Treatment was repeated on day 20 after tumor inoculation. Tumor areas (mm2) were

substantial OX40+ populations in the TME, making each of
these cell types plausible targets of OX40L-Fc–based therapy.
T-cell–independent enrichment of mature DC
expressing the lymph node–homing receptor CCR7 in
the TDLN shortly after treatment with OX40L-Fc
Given the observed high levels of OX40 expressed by TIDC
in untreated tumor-bearing mice, we next evaluated how DC
populations were altered in response to OX40L-Fc treatment.
By day 3 after the first OX40L-Fc treatment, TIDC expression
of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 was augmented (data not shown), and a concordant increase in
CD11c+CD11b+ DC within the TDLN was observed when
compared with isotype mAb-treated control mice (Fig. 3A).
These TDLN DC populations expressed elevated levels of
CD80 and the lymph node–homing chemokine receptor
CCR7 when compared with TDLN isolated from isotype
mAb-treated control animals (Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, enrichment of DC on OX40L-Fc treatment was similarly
observed in the TDLN of Rag−/− mice bearing established
MCA205 tumors (Fig. 3B). These data are consistent with
the T-cell–independent activation/maturation of OX40+
TIDC to become competent for trafficking to the TDLN

within the initial 3 days of OX40L-Fc–based therapy. Longitudinal analysis suggests that treatment-induced migration of
TIDC to the TDLN persists through day 7 of the therapy
period, with a return to control conditions by day 10 (data
not shown). Such trafficking of activated DC would be
anticipated to sponsor the cross-priming of antitumor T-cell
responses in the TDLN. We observed no substantial alterations, however, in DC frequency or phenotype in non-TDLN
(data not shown).
OX40L-Fc treatment promotes the expansion of TDLN
T cells expressing the tissue-homing type 1 chemokine
receptor CXCR3
To assess alterations in the TDLN T-cell compartment following OX40L-Fc treatment and TIDC trafficking to the
TDLN, we harvested TDLN from mice on days 3, 7, and 10
after initiating treatment and determined absolute numbers
of CD4+Foxp3− and CD8+ T effector cells. Time-dependent increases in both T-cell subpopulations were noted as a consequence of OX40L-Fc treatment, with numbers of TDLN T
cells peaking at day 7 after treatment (Fig. 3C). Indeed, 7 days
after initiating OX40L-Fc treatment, highly significant upregulation in expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 was

observed for both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets within the
TDLN (P < 0.01; Fig. 3D). Although these T cells did not exhibit any alterations in activation marker expression (CD25
and CD69; data not shown), both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expanded from OX40L-Fc– versus control mAb–treated mice
were enriched in the CD44hi phenotype at day 7 after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3A), supporting the ability of
OX40L-Fc therapy to preferentially stimulate memory T cells.
It has recently been shown that type 1 polarized CD8+
T cells are effectively recruited to tumor sites via CXCR3mediated chemotaxis in response to the CXCL9-11 chemokines produced within the TME (27). To determine whether
TDLN T cells in OX40L-Fc–treated animals are differentially
competent to migrate to the TME based on this index, we
assessed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells for their expression of CXCR3
7 days after the initiation of therapy. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3B, we found that the CXCR3+ subpopulation of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was increased after OX40L-Fc versus
control mAb treatment. These data suggest that OX40 agonist
therapy not only stimulates expansion of TDLN T cells but also

licenses these cells for trafficking to peripheral tissue sites in
which CXCR3 ligands are expressed, such as the TME.
Tumors become enriched in T effector cells by day 10
following OX40L-Fc treatment
Based on our observation that maximal numbers of CXCR3+
TDLN T cells occurred by day 7 after OX40L-Fc treatment,
we hypothesized that these transport-competent T cells might
then infiltrate the TME shortly thereafter. Although increased
frequencies of CD4+Foxp3− and CD8+ T effector cells were
detected in the TME throughout the observation period,
a highly significant increase versus control mAb–treated
animals was noted for CD4+Foxp3− TIL at days 7 and 10
after treatment and CD8+ TIL at day 10 after treatment
(P < 0.01; Fig. 4A). The change in percentages of T effector cells
correlated with increases in the number of CD4 + Foxp3 −
and CD8 + TIL per gram of tumor tissue (Supplementary
Fig. S4). To distinguish between the recruitment of T effector
cells and in situ T-cell expansion within the TME, TILs
were analyzed for their expression of Ki67. Although Ki67

expression was upregulated by T cells in the TDLN of OX40LFc–treated mice (Fig. 3D), expression of this marker on TIL
was not substantially altered (Fig. 4B), suggesting that T effector cell accumulation in the TME of treated mice is most likely
attributed to the enhanced recruitment of these cells, rather
than to their expansion within tumor lesions.
Despite an elevated frequency of CD4+Foxp3+ T cells being
consistently identified in the TDLN of OX40L-Fc–treated
mice (Supplementary Fig. S5A), the frequency of these cells
in the TME was reduced as early as day 3 after treatment
and this level remained low throughout the observation period (Supplementary Fig. S5B), consistent with a recent report (28). Additionally, a decrease in cells exhibiting a
myeloid-derived suppressor cell phenotype (CD11b+Gr-1+)
was observed in the TME, along with a coordinate increase
in F4/80+ mature monocytes/macrophages between days 7
and 10 after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Tumor-infiltrating T cells exhibit a reactivated memory
phenotype and are type 1 polarized
An analysis of the phenotype of TIL on day 10 after OX40LFc treatment, at which time T effector cell frequencies in the
TME peaked, suggested no differential expression of CD25 or
CD69 versus the control mAb–treated cohort (data not
shown). However, the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ TIL expressing high levels of CD44 (CD44hi, antigen experienced)
and low levels of CD27 (CD27low, recently activated) was enriched at this time point (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S7).
These phenotypic analyses are consistent with a model in
which OX40L-Fc–stimulated T cells are expanded in the
TDLN by day 7 after treatment and subsequently infiltrate
the TME by day 10 after treatment.
Because effective cancer immunotherapies have been
largely associated with a state of type 1 T-cell polarization
and an increased T effector cell–to–Treg ratio (29, 30), we

next examined the polarization status of freshly isolated TIL
on days 3 to 10 following OX40L-Fc versus control mAb treatment. Using quantitative RT-PCR, factors associated with
type 1 T-cell activity (i.e., T-bet and IFN-γ) and those associated with regulatory T-cell activity (i.e., Foxp3 and IL-10)
were assessed for their relative levels of expression. Although
minimal alterations were observed in the expression of any of
these four transcripts on days 3 and 7 after treatment, by day
10 after treatment, at a time when increased frequencies of
TILs were observed, transcript levels for all four gene products were dramatically enhanced in the OX40L-Fc treatment group (Fig. 5A, top). This is consistent with a recent
report by Ruby and colleagues (31), who propose that although all T-cell lineages are responsive to OX40 stimulation,
the plasticity of the response is dependent on the local cytokine milieu. By considering the “balance” of polarized T-cell
responses based on a ratio of the effector-to-regulatory gene

transcripts, however, we noted that OX40L-Fc treatment
skews the balance in favor of type 1 T-cell immunity at all
time points analyzed (Fig. 5A, bottom). Similar alterations
in these transcript ratios were observed in anti-CD3–stimulated TIL (Fig. 5B). This suggests that although OX40 signaling may not be a polarizing event per se, a cytokine milieu
appropriate for the preferential expansion of type 1 versus
regulatory-type immunity exists within the OX40L-Fc–
treated TME.
To ensure that alterations in IFN-γ RNA expression correlated with alterations at the protein level, TILs were isolated on days 3 to 10 after treatment and stimulated in vitro
before analysis of IFN-γ secretion levels by ELISA. Interestingly, TIL production of IFN-γ was not elevated, and perhaps even slightly reduced on day 3 after treatment with
OX40L-Fc versus isotype mAb (Fig. 5C). In contrast, TIL isolated 7 and 10 days after initiating OX40L-Fc–based therapy

produced significantly higher levels of IFN-γ protein versus

time points. Moreover, when comparing the effector-toregulatory balance at the cellular level within the TME, significant increases were observed in both the CD4+Foxp3− and

treatment (P < 0.01; Fig. 5D).

In parallel with an increased fraction of CXCR3+ T cells in

Fc therapy redundantly promotes TIL trafficking by augmenting chemokine signals in both the periphery and the TME. We
have also recently reported that effective recruitment of adoptively transferred type 1 polarized CD8+ T cells into the TME
requires tumor-associated VEC expression of VCAM-1 (32).
Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that
tumor-associated CD31+ VECs rapidly upregulate (i.e., by
day 3) and maintain VCAM-1 expression through day 10
as a consequence of treatment with OX40L-Fc (Fig. 6B, left),
suggesting that type 1 T effector cell recruitment into
the TME might be further enhanced by OX40L-Fc via additional chemokine-independent mechanisms. Importantly,
treatment-associated enhancement of VCAM-1 and CXCL9
expression by CD31+ VEC was recapitulated in Rag−/− mice
(Fig. 6A and B, right), suggesting the T-cell–independent

nature of these changes. In support of a direct effect of
OX40L-Fc on VEC within the TME, we detected moderate
levels of OX40 expression by a subset of CD31+CD11b− VEC
in untreated, progressor tumors (Supplementary Fig. S8). It
is also important to note that Fig. 6A data suggest that additional (non-VEC) stromal cells in the TME produce
CXCL9 in wild-type, but not Rag−/−, mice (most strikingly
on day 7 after treatment with OX40L-Fc). Hence, therapeutic production of CXCL9 in the TME seems to result from
both T-cell–dependent and T-cell–independent processes.
We also observed a pronounced reorganization of the tumor vasculature after OX40L-Fc treatment, consistent with
what has previously been described as a more “normalized”
phenotype (33). Whereas CD31+ VEC density increased coordinately with disease progression in the tumors of isotype

control mAb–treated mice, vessel density in OX40LFc–treated tumors was significantly diminished by day 10
after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S9A). These alterations
in vascular density at day 10 after treatment additionally correlated with a less tortuous and more organized (i.e., normalized) morphology of OX40L-Fc– versus control mAb–treated
tumor vasculature (Supplementary Fig. S9B), consistent with
a phenotype favorable for lymphocyte infiltration.

Discussion
In this report, we describe multifaceted antitumor activities
associated with a novel mOX40L-Fc fusion protein when
applied in the therapeutic setting against well-established

H-2b and H-2d sarcomas. When administered i.p. on days 17
and 20 after tumor inoculation, OX40L-Fc treatment inhibited
tumor growth, resulting in disease stabilization or complete
regression in the majority of treated animals.
In the TDLN of mice bearing well-established MCA205 sarcomas, OX40 expression was restricted to CD4 + Foxp3 +
T cells, whereas CD4+Foxp3− and CD8+ T effector cells, as well
as DC and potentially VEC, were observed to be OX40+ in the
TME. Expression of OX40 has also been reported to be
upregulated by T cells in primary tumors, but not in the
tumor-free lymph nodes of human cancer patients (34). In
alternative disease models, T-cell upregulation of OX40 has
been observed at sites of inflammation during the onset of
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (35), and within
the synovial fluid but not the peripheral blood of patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (36). This has been attributed to
the influence of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 and
TNF-α (37, 38). Such cytokines could also play a role in upregulating the expression of OX40 by tumor-localized DC and
VEC in our well-established sarcoma models. Furthermore,
4-1BB, an alternate member of the costimulatory TNFR
family with structural and functional similarities to OX40,
can be expressed by activated DC and atherosclerotic
endothelia under the appropriate conditions (39, 40).
Numerous studies have indicated that both CD4+ and
CD8+ T effector cells play instrumental roles in antitumor immunity stimulated by OX40 agonists in vivo (41). Consistent
with this notion, we observed significant expansion of
CXCR3 + TDLN T effector cells on day 7 after initiating
OX40L-Fc–based therapy, followed on day 10 after treatment by the accumulation of reactivated, type 1 polarized
CD4+Foxp3− and CD8+ T cells in the TME. Our data from
Rag−/− models also now suggest the T-cell–independent nature of OX40L-Fc–mediated events, including (a) the rapid
and sustained production of CXCL9 and expression of
VCAM-1 on VEC in established tumors and (b) the
conversion of OX40+ TIDC into transport-competent APC
(deduced from the subsequent enrichment of CD11c
+
CCR7+ myeloid DC in the TDLN by day 3 after treatment). Although a recent study has shown a similar enhancement in DC trafficking to the TDLN on treatment
with OX40 agonist mAb in an early-stage tumor model,
this finding was attributed to therapy-mediated suppression of Treg function and to a corollary restoration in
the migratory capacity of TIDC (42). Instead, based on
the constitutive expression of OX40 by a subpopulation
of TIDC in the well-established TME and the preservation
of DC alterations in Rag−/− mice following OX40L-Fc treatment, these alterations may occur via the direct engagement of OX40 on these cells. To unequivocally show a
direct effect of OX40L-Fc on TIDC, prospective therapeutic
models using chimeric mice in which only DCs are genetically deficient in expression of OX40 will be pursued.
The importance of manipulating the tumor vasculature to
attract T cells has recently been shown by Quezada and colleagues (43), who report ICAM and VCAM upregulation in
the TME on prophylactic Treg depletion as well as therapeutic vaccination (Gvax)/anti–CTLA-4 combination treatment,

9050

indicating that vascular activation may be achieved through
several distinct mechanisms. Similar to our data, activation
of the tumor vasculature in these models correlated with enhanced T-cell infiltration, increased T effector–to–Treg ratios, and improved therapeutic efficacy. Our data further
suggest that therapy-associated induction of chemokines
and adhesion molecules that render the TME more permissive to immune cell infiltration can be achieved in the absence of T cells. OX40L-Fc could conceivably mediate
vascular activation in the TME of Rag−/− mice via (a) direct
stimulation of a subset of OX40+ VEC, (b) inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production by OX40+ TIDC, or (c) the participation of alternate inflammatory (i.e., NK among others)
effector cells present in these mice. The initial effects of nonhematopoietic and/or innate immune cell subsets in therapymediated vascular activation, however, are likely to synergize
with the effects mediated by T cells in immune-competent
hosts. In our model, for example, initial secretion of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-α) by OX40+ TIDC on OX40L-Fc treatment may induce CXCL9 and VCAM-1 expression in the TME,
allowing for the recruitment of type 1 polarized T effector cells
that produce IFN-γ (a potent inducer of CXCL9 and other angiostatic chemokines), resulting in further remodeling of the
tumor vasculature and enhanced T-cell infiltration. Future
studies will investigate the validity of this paradigm.
Based on the tumor growth curves of OX40L-Fc– versus
control mAb–treated mice, the effect of therapy only becomes apparent by 7 to 10 days after the initiation of therapy.
This is consistent with the infiltration of a highly reactive
CD27low CD44 hi CD8+ T effector cell population into the
TME. As OX40 signaling has been previously shown to enhance recall responses and to preferentially expand CD44hi
memory T cells on antigen rechallenge (44, 45), this may suggest that OX40L-Fc treatment leads to the expansion of a tumor antigen–experienced, rather than naive, T effector cell
population in the TDLN, and subsequent trafficking of these
T cells to the TME. Regardless, these infiltrating T cells seem
competent to promote tumor regression or to regulate a
state of tumor dormancy (i.e., stable disease) in the majority
of OX40L-Fc–treated animals for a period of several weeks
before the ultimate “escape” of progressor lesions. We are
currently investigating whether this late progression event
results from the erosion of protective antitumor T-cell responses, the outgrowth of less-immunogenic tumor cell
variants, and/or the reacquisition of aberrant vascular
structures in the TME (46). If the former mechanism underlies the ultimate failure of OX40L-Fc to induce complete
tumor rejection, we would anticipate the enhanced benefits
of extending the number of treatment cycles involving OX40
agonists.
Overall, the therapeutic benefits shown for OX40L-Fc in
our well-established sarcoma models strongly support the
continued translation of OX40 agonists, particularly those
based on a recombinant form of OX40L, into human clinical
trials. Moving forward, it will be important to better delineate how the various OX40+ target cell populations within
the TME (and elsewhere) are affected by OX40-mediated
signals to select potential cotherapeutic agents and to define
