Abstract

Author Manuscript

Guanine nucleotide binding protein-like 3-like (GNL3L) is a nucleolar protein and the vertebrate
paralogue of nucleostemin (NS). We previously reported that nucleoplasmic mobilization of NS
stabilizes MDM2 (mouse double minute 2). Here, we investigated the role of GNL3L as a novel
MDM2 regulator. We found that GNL3L binds MDM2 in vivo and displays the same function as
NS in stabilizing MDM2 protein and preventing its ubiquitylation. The interaction between
GNL3L and MDM2 also takes place in the nucleoplasm. However, the MDM2-regulatory activity
of GNL3L occurs constitutively and does not so much depend on the nucleolar release mechanism
as NS does. GNL3L depletion triggers G2/M arrest in the p53-wild-type HCT116 cells more than
in the p53-null cells, and up-regulates specific p53 targets (i.e. Bax, 14-3-3σ, and p21) without
affecting the ubiquitylation or stability of p53 proteins. The inhibitory activity of GNL3L on p53mediated transcription correlates with the increased expression of GNL3L and reduced expression
of 14-3-3σ and p21 in human gastrointestinal tumors. This work shows that, in contrast to most
nucleolar proteins that negatively control MDM2, GNL3L and NS are the only two that are
designed to stabilize MDM2 protein under basal or induced condition, respectively, and may act
as tumor-promoting genes.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

As proteins residing in the nucleolus are being cataloged systematically, so is the focus on
this classic organelle turned from its ribosomal function to non-ribosomal role (Pederson &
Tsai, 2009). Nucleostemin (NS) is one of the nucleolar proteins shown to be capable of
exercising non-ribosomal activities. It is preferentially expressed by undifferentiated stem/
progenitor cells undergoing active proliferation, and plays an essential role in early
embryogenesis and self-renewal. The vertebrate NS family includes three members - NS,
GNL3L, and Ngp-1, all of which contain a unique MMR1_HSR1 domain of five GTP-

binding motifs arranged in a circularly permuted order (Tsai & Meng, 2009). NS and
GNL3L are vertebrate paralogues that share a common invertebrate orthologue, whereas
Ngp-1 exists as a single gene from yeast to human.

Author Manuscript

The biological importance of NS is best demonstrated by the early embryonic lethal
phenotype of NS-null mice (Beekman et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2006) but also by multiple
studies showing its function in maintaining the continuous proliferation of cancer and stem
cells. One of the proposed mechanisms for the NS activity is via MDM2 regulation. A study
reported that NS depletion enhances MDM2 interaction with L5 and L11 and induces p53
activation (Dai et al., 2008). We found that nucleoplasmic mobilization of NS stabilizes
MDM2 protein and inhibits the p53 transcription activity (Meng et al., 2008). Reciprocally,
MDM2 is responsible for the degradation of NS protein induced by guanine nucleotide
depletion (Huang et al., 2009). Compared to NS, the GNL3L function is much less explored.
It has been shown to negatively regulate the telomere length (Fu & Collins, 2007) and to
promote the metaphase-to-anaphase transition via TRF1 stabilization (Zhu et al., 2009). So
far, it is not clear whether GNL3L regulates the MDM2/p53 pathway or how it relates to the
MDM2-stabilizing activity of NS.

Mammalian NS was first cloned as a neural stem cell (NSC)-enriched gene (Tsai & McKay,
2002), and later found to be abundantly expressed by other stem cell types, cancer cells, and
the adult testis (Baddoo et al., 2003; Maki et al., 2007; Ohmura et al., 2008; Siddiqi et al.,
2008). In contrast, GNL3L is expressed lower in the undifferentiated NSCs than in their
differentiated progeny during neural development, and is preferentially expressed by the
cerebellum and forebrain in adult animals (Yasumoto et al., 2007). At the subcellular level,
NS is highly concentrated in the nucleolus, whereas GNL3L displays a higher nucleoplasmic
intensity and a much shorter nucleolar retention time than NS (Meng et al., 2007). Among
the NS-interacting proteins, functional outcomes have been shown for p53 (Ma & Pederson,
2007; Tsai & McKay, 2002), MDM2 (mouse double minute 2) (Dai et al., 2008; Meng et al.,
2008), TRF1 (telomeric repeat binding factor 1) (Zhu et al., 2006), ARF (alternative reading
frame) (Ma & Pederson, 2007), and RSL1D1 (ribosomal L1 domain containing 1) (Meng et
al., 2006). So far, only three proteins, i.e. the estrogen receptor-related protein (ERR), TERT
(telomerase reverse transcriptase), and TRF1, have been shown to interact with GNL3L (Fu
& Collins, 2007; Yasumoto et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2009).

Given the paralogous relationship between NS and GNL3L, we began to investigate the
possibility that GNL3L may be a novel MDM2 regulator that functions redundantly with or
distinctively from NS. Here, we report that GNL3L can stabilize MDM2 protein by
preventing its ubiquitylation, and rescue the NS-knockdown-induced MDM2 ubiquitylation.
Unlike NS, the anti-MDM2-ubiquitylation activity of GNL3L occurs constitutively and is
not as much controlled by the nucleolar release mechanism as NS is. Consistent with its
MDM2-stabilizing ability, GNL3L knockdown triggers G2/M arrest and up-regulates
specific p53 downstream targets, i.e. Bax, 14-3-3σ, and p21, more so in the p53-wild-type
than in the p53-null HCT116 cells. In accordance, high percentages of human colorectal and
gastric cancers express high levels of GNL3L and low levels of 14-3-3σ and p21. This work
indicates a potential role of GNL3L as a tumor-promoting factor via MDM2 stabilization.

Results
GNL3L binds MDM2 via its G- or I-domain and the central domain of MDM2

Author Manuscript

A connection between GNL3L and MDM2 was first revealed by coimmunoprecipitation
(coIP) of MDM2 (Myc-tagged) and NS family proteins (HA-tagged), which showed that
both NS and GNL3L can be coimmunoprecitated with MDM2 by anti-Myc (rows 1 and 2)
or anti-HA antibody (rows 3 and 4) (Fig. 1a). In contrast, little or no Ngp-1 interacts with
MDM2. Endogenous coIP further confirmed that GNL3L and MDM2 co-reside in the same
protein complex immunoprecipitated by anti-MDM2 or anti-GNL3L antibody in HeLa cells
(Fig. 1b). To investigate the MDM2-binding relationship between NS and GNL3L, antiFLAG coIP of expressed MDM2 (FLAG), GNL3L (HA), and/or NS (Myc) was performed
in HEK293 cells and showed that GNL3L appears to have a stronger activity in competing
against NS for MDM2 binding than NS does against GNL3L (Fig. 1c, left panel). The better
MDM2 binding of GNL3L than that of NS may be caused by their differential
nucleoplasmic distribution (see Fig. S1). To examine this possibility, we conducted the same
competitive coIP experiment using wild-type GNL3L and NS-G256V mutant, which is
mislocalized to the nucleoplasm but still maintains its MDM2-binding activity. The results
showed that NS-G256V displays a stronger MDM2-binding activity compared to GNL3L
(Fig. 1c, right panel). Finally, triple coIP demonstrated that GNL3L does not bind p53
directly but does so in the presence of MDM2, suggesting that MDM2 may bridge between
GNL3L and p53 (Fig. 1d).

Author Manuscript

The binding interface between MDM2 and GNL3L was defined by non-overlapping deletion
mutants of MDM2 on its p53-binding (N, a.a. 1–108), intermediate-1 (I1, a.a. 109–222),
acidic-zinc finger (AZ, a.a. 223–322), intermediate-2 (I2, a.a. 323–434), and RING-finger
domains (R, a.a. 435–491) (Fig. 2a1). Anti-Myc coIP of MDM2 mutants (Myc) and fulllength GNL3L-HA showed that deleting the I1 (dI1), AZ (dAZ), or I2 domain (dI2) of
MDM2 reduces its ability to bind GNL3L (Fig. 2a2). To map the MDM2-binding site(s) on
GNL3L, GNL3L mutants lacking the basic (B, a.a. 1–20), basic-coiled-coil (BC, a.a. 1–87),
GTP-binding (G, a.a. 88–297), intermediate (I, a.a. 298–535), or C2 (a.a. 536–582) domain
were created (Fig. 2b1). Anti-HA coIP of full-length MDM2-Myc and mutant GNL3L (HA)
showed that none of the single domain deletion mutants of GNL3L lose their ability to bind
MDM2 and suggested the involvement of multiple GNL3L domains (Fig. 2b2). CoIP of
complex deletion mutants of GNL3L (Fig. 2c1) confirmed that both the G and I-domains of
GNL3L are sufficient to bind MDM2 (Fig. 2c2, c3). These data demonstrate that the
interaction between GNL3L and MDM2 is mediated by the central region of MDM2 and the
G or I domain of GNL3L.

GNL3L stabilizes MDM2 protein by reducing its ubiquitylation
We investigated how GNL3L affects MDM2 and found that siRNA knockdown of GNL3L
(siG3-2) reduces the amount of endogenous MDM2 protein in p53-inactive HeLa cells,
which can be reversed by putting back a siG3-2-resistant GNL3L construct (G3L-siR) (Fig.
3a). In consistence, GNL3L overexpression increases the endogenous MDM2 protein level
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3b). We next determined the effect of GNL3L
overexpression on MDM2 protein stability in cycloheximide-treated H1299 cells expressing

recombinant MDM2 proteins. Western results showed that MDM2 proteins in the GNL3Loverexpressing cells are degraded much slower than that in the control cells (Fig. 3c, p <
0.0001 by Repeated Measures ANOVA). To confirm this finding, the endogenous MDM2
protein stability was measured in cycloheximide-treated HCT116-8 cells. GNL3L
knockdown (G3L-KD) significantly reduces the stability of the endogenous MDM2 protein
(protein half-life [T1/2] = 8.4 minutes) as compared to the control knockdown (T1/2 = 17.2
minutes, n=3, p < 0.005 by Repeated Measures ANOVA), but has no effect on the
endogenous p53 protein stability (p=0.27) (Fig. 3d). To investigate whether GNL3L
regulates MDM2 ubiquitylation, HEK293 cells were transfected with (His)6-tagged
ubiquitin, MDM2, and GNL3L-targeting shRNAmir (shG3- a) constructs. Ubiquitylated
proteins were captured by Ni2+-chelating sepharose and detected by anti-MDM2 western
blots. The results showed that GNL3L knockdown significantly increases the ubiquitylation
of MDM2, and that this effect can be rescued by the shG3-a-resistant GNL3L (G3L-shR)
(Fig. 3e). Similarly, GNL3L overexpression decreases the amount of ubiquitylated MDM2
(Fig. 3f). In consistence with the lack of effect of GNL3L on p53 protein stability, neither
knockdown nor overexpression of GNL3L changes the amount of MDM2-medidated p53
ubiquitylation (Fig. 3g).
GNL3L constitutively interacts with MDM2 in the nucleoplasm

Author Manuscript

To determine where GNL3L and MDM2 interact within the cell, HCT116-8 cells were
transfected with GFP-fused GNL3L and FLAG-tagged MDM2 individually or together.
Confocal studies showed that GNL3L and MDM2 overlap considerably in the nucleoplasm
but not in the nucleolus (Fig. 4a). To show their dynamic interaction in living cells, FLIP
(fluorescence loss during photobleaching) was used to determine the nucleolarnucleoplasmic exchange rate of GFP-fused MDM2, represented by the disappearance of its
nucleoplasmic signal while bleaching the nucleolus (Meng et al., 2007). We reasoned that if
GNL3L complexes with MDM2 in the nucleoplasm, the exchange rate of MDM2 will be
increased by GNL3L knockdown. Indeed, the nucleolar-nucleoplasmic exchange rate of
MDM2 is significantly increased by GNL3L knockdown (G3L-KD, mean decay half-time
[T1/2] = 45.1 seconds) compared to the control-knockdown samples (Ctrl-KD, T1/2 = 28.7
seconds, p < 0.01 by Repeated Measures ANOVA, n=27) (Fig. 4b1, b2). By contrast,
overexpression of GNL3L has only a small effect on reducing the exchange rate of MDM2
(p = 0.05 by Repeated Measures ANOVA, n=30) (Fig. 4b3), which may be due to the
constitutive interaction between MDM2 and the endogenous GNL3L. This is in contrast to
what we have found in NS, which shows a much clearer effect on the MDM2 FLIP rate
when overexpressed than knocked down (Meng et al., 2008). These results demonstrate that
GNL3L constitutively interacts with MDM2 in the nucleoplasm.

Author Manuscript

The MDM2-regulatory activity of GNL3L is constitutively active and does not depend on
the nucleolar release mechanism
The FLIP results indicate that GNL3L binds MDM2 constitutively. We therefore
hypothesize that the MDM2 ubiquitylation activity of GNL3L may also be constantly active
and less regulated by the nucleolar release mechanism compared to that of NS. To test this
idea, we first measured the effect of GNL3L and NS knockdown on MDM2 ubiquitylation
and showed that GNL3L knockdown has a more profound effect in increasing MDM2

ubiquitylation than does NS knockdown (Fig. 5a). Next, we compared the MDM2
ubiquitylation effects of wild-type GNL3L and its nucleoplasm-mislocalized mutants. These
mutations include deletion of its nucleolar localization signal (G3L-dB) or point mutation on
the conserved GTP-binding residue (G3L-G253V) (Fig. S1). The results showed that these
two nucleoplasmic forms of GNL3L show comparable activities in reducing MDM2
ubiquitylation to the wild-type GNL3L (Fig. 5b). The effect of NS overexpression in
reducing MDM2 ubiquitylation is slightly less than that of GNL3L overexpression. Notably,
the MDM2-regulatory activity of NS nucleoplasmic mutants is significantly stronger
compared not only to wild-type NS but also to wild-type and mutant GNL3L, indicating that
after being released from the nucleolus, NS may exert a stronger effect in reducing MDM2
ubiquitylation than GNL3L does. The release of nucleolar proteins from the nucleolus can
be triggered by the mitotic entry. Since more NS is partitioned in the nucleolus than GNL3L,
one may expect this event to increase the NS-MDM2 binding more than the GNL3L-MDM2
binding. To compare the effect of mitosis-induced nucleolar disassembly on the NS-MDM2
and GNL3L-MDM2 interactions, we measured the endogenous binding between MDM2 and
GNL3L (or NS) in S-phase and M-phase synchronized cells, and found that the mitosisinduced increase of coIP efficiency is more evident in the NS-MDM2 binding than in the
GNL3L-MDM2 binding (Fig. 5c). Together, these data demonstrate that despite the
common activity of NS and GNL3L in preventing MDM2 ubiquitylation, they differ in that
the GNL3L effect is constitutively active and the NS effect is triggered by the nucleolar
release mechanism.
GNL3L knockdown induced G2/M arrest and p53 activation

Author Manuscript

One frequently debated issue concerning the NS activity is whether its cell cycle effect is
p53 dependent or not. To clarify this issue for GNL3L, we examined the cell cycle profiles
of GNL3L knockdown in two isogenic cell lines that differ only in their p53 status. The
parental HCT116-8 cells were derived from human colorectal carcinoma with normal p53
functions and a mutation in the ras proto-oncogene. The HCT116-2 line is a derivative of
the HCT116-8 line, in which p53 is inactivated by homologous recombination (Bunz et al.,
1998). In HCT116-8 (p53+/+) cells, GNL3L knockdown decreases the G1 cell percentage (p
< 0.0001) and increases the percentage of G2/M cells (p = 0.001) (Fig. 6a). In HCT116-2
(p53−/−) cells, the G2/M arrest effect of GNL3L knockdown is less significant (p = 0.07).
The differential sensitivity of p53+/+ and p53−/−cells to GNL3L knockdown is not caused by
differences in their GNL3L knockdown efficiencies, as western blots confirmed a more
effective GNL3L knockdown in the p53−/−cells than in the p53+/+ cells (Fig. 6b). Western
blots also showed that GNL3L knockdown decreases the amount of MDM2 protein in both
p53-wild-type and null cells and increases the amount of phospho-Cdc2 (Y15) (an inhibitor
of mitotic entry) mainly in the p53-wild-type cells, but does not change the p53 protein
level. To determine how GNL3L depletion affects the p53 activity, we measured the mRNA
levels of several p53-regulated genes by real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Fig.6c). The results
first confirmed that the GNL3L knockdown efficiencies in p53-wild-type and null cells are
25% and 50%, respectively. Notably, GNL3L depletion induces a significant up-regulation
of Bax (p<0.0001), 14-3-3-σ (p<0.0001), and p21 (p<0.01) in a p53-dependent manner, but
does not affect the expression levels of MDM2, Gadd45, or Apaf-1.

NS depletion triggers a compensatory up-regulation of GNL3L

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine whether the expressions of NS and GNL3L are co-regulated, we compared
their mRNA and protein levels in control (siScr), NS-knockdown (siNS), and GNL3Lknockdown (siG3L) cells (Fig. 7a). qRT-PCR and western assays showed that NS depletion
induces a significant up-regulation of GNL3L transcripts and proteins in both p53-wild-type
and null HCT116 cells (p<0.001) and a moderate increase of GNL3L in U2OS cells
(p=0.04). The increase of GNL3L following NS knockdown is cell type-specific, as NSknockdown HeLa and HEK293 cells show no such an effect, and does not work reciprocally
on NS when GNL3L is depleted. NS can also be decreased by guanine nucleotide depletion
at the protein level (Huang et al., 2009). Interestingly, mycophenolic acid (MPA) treatment,
which depletes the endogenous guanine nucleotide by blocking the de novo guanine
nucleotide biosynthesis, concomitantly decreases the NS protein and increases the GNL3L
protein (Fig. 7b). This increase of GNL3L protein can be reversed by adding a 26S
proteasome inhibitor, MG132, but not by restoring the NS level, indicating that the MPA
effect on GNL3L is not directly controlled by the level of NS protein. To further examine
whether GNL3L can functionally compensate for the loss-of-NS effect on MDM2
ubiquitylation, we performed rescue experiments and showed that the NS-knockdowninduced MDM2 ubiquitylation increase can be fully reversed by coexpression of GNL3L
(Fig. 7c). These results indicate that some cells may up-regulate GNL3L to functionally
compensate for the loss of NS.
Correlation between GNL3L expression and p53 activities in human cancers

Author Manuscript

To establish the relevance of GNL3L and its p53 regulatory activity in human cancers, we
first analyzed the expression levels of GNL3L in primary tumor samples using the
Oncomine 4.3 (http://www.oncomine.org). We set the threshold of our analysis at p-value <
0.05 and fold-change > 1.5, and calculated the percentage of tumor samples showing upregulation or down-regulation of the target genes (Fig. 8). We found that a significant
portion of the bladder, brain, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, head and neck, kidney, ovarian,
and sarcoma tumors show increased levels of GNL3L compared to the normal tissues.
Particularly, the colorectal, esophageal, and gastric tumors display the highest percentages
of samples with increased GNL3L expression. Notably, it is also in these three types of
tumors that we found down-regulation of 14-3-3σ and p21. The decrease of 14-3-3σ and p21
in colorectal carcinomas indicates p53 suppression, which cannot be explained by the
transcript changes in MDM2, p53, and other nucleolar proteins that stabilize p53, including
ARF, B23, L5, L11, and L23 (Fig. S2). The expression of Bax, however, is increased in
most tumor types. Together, these expression patterns support the idea that high levels of
GNL3L may suppress p53 activities in human colorectal cancers.

Discussion
GNL3L and NS both stabilize MDM2 protein by preventing its ubiquitylation
This study reveals GNL3L as a novel MDM2 regulator as is its vertebrate paraglogue, NS
(Fig. 7d). GNL3L and NS share similar MDM2-binding characteristics, i.e. both occur in the
nucleoplasm and bind to the central domain of MDM2. The MDM2 interaction of GNL3L is
mediated by its G- or I-domain, which is different from the MDM2-interactive C- and AOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 October 07.

domains of NS. Functionally, GNL3L shows the same ability as NS in stabilizing MDM2
protein and preventing its ubiquitylation, and is capable of rescuing the MDM2
ubiquitylation effect caused by NS depletion. Like NS, MDM2 destabilization by GNL3L
knockdown affects neither the ubiquitylation nor the stability of p53 proteins. Therefore, the
GNL3L-stabilized MDM2 may inhibit the transcriptional activation of p53 through a direct
binding mechanism without affecting the p53 protein level. Previous reports have shown
that deletion of the acidic-zinc finger domain of MDM2 blocks its p53 degradation activity
(Kubbutat et al., 1999) and that p53 ubiquitylation can be inhibited by peptide binding to the
acidic domain of MDM2 (Wallace et al., 2006). Considering that GNL3L also binds to the
central domain of MDM2, the lack of effect on p53 stability and ubiquitylation by GNL3L
indicates that GNL3L binding to MDM2 may disrupt the E3 ligase activity of MDM2,
which may also explain how NS and GNL3L prevent MDM2 ubiquitylation, as MDM2 also
serves as its own E3 ligase (Fang et al., 2000).

Distinct features in GNL3L and NS-mediated MDM2 regulation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Despite their similar effects on MDM2 stabilization, GNL3L and NS are designed to operate
under distinct biological contexts. The binding and ubiquitylation activity of GNL3L on
MDM2 is constitutive and does not so much depend on the nucleolar release mechanism. In
contrast, the MDM2-stabilizing effect of NS is only active when the nucleolar release
mechanism is triggered and therefore is mainly used in the context of cell cycle counting or
stress response. Such a difference in the GNL3L and NS-mediated MDM2 regulation may
be due to their differential nucleolar-nucleoplasmic partitioning dynamics (Meng et al.,
2007). Consistent with the idea that the MDM2-stabilizing effect of GNL3L is constitutively
active and the NS effect is kept inactive in normal growing interphase cells, GNL3L
knockdown shows a stronger effect on the FLIP kinetics and ubiquitylation of MDM2 than
NS knockdown does. Even though wild-type NS is mostly inactive in MDM2 regulation in
unstressed interphase cells, a significant amount of NS protein can still be seen in the
nucleoplasm when overexpressed. This nucleoplasmic overflow of overexpressed NS and
the constitutive binding of endogenous GNL3L and MDM2 may explain why NS and
GNL3L overexpression show only a small difference in MDM2 ubiquitylation. It should be
noted that the MDM2-regulatory activity of NS nucleoplasmic mutants (NS-dB and NSG256V) is significantly stronger than that of wild-type and mutant GNL3L, and that NSG256V shows a stronger MDM2-binding ability than GNL3L. These two results indicate
that once released from the nucleolus, NS may exert a stronger effect in reducing MDM2
ubiquitylation than GNL3L does. Besides MDM2 regulation, NS and GNL3L also exercise
distinct biological activities in TRF1 and ERRγ regulation, where they show opposite effects
on TRF1 protein stability (Zhu et al., 2009), and only GNL3L can inhibit the transcription
activity of ERRγ (Yasumoto et al., 2007).
Relationship between MDM2 destabilization and p53 activation in GNL3L-depleted cells
GNL3L knockdown produces a more prominent G2/M arrest phenotype in the p53-wildtype cells (p < 0.001) than in the p53-null cells (p = 0.07), showing that the p53 pathway
clearly contributes to the cell cycle phenotype of GNL3L-knockdown cells. GNL3L
knockdown also leads to increases in phospho-Cdc2 (Y15) and several p53 downstream
targets, including Bax, 14-3-3σ, and p21. Up-regulation of 14-3-3σ or p21 can trigger G2/M

arrest by retaining the Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex in the cytoplasm (Hermeking et al., 1997;
Taylor & Stark, 2001) or by directly inhibiting Cdc2 (Bunz et al., 1998; Taylor & Stark,
2001), respectively. Notably, the expression profiles of GNL3L, 14-3-3σ, and p21 in
primary tumor samples fit the idea that GNL3L plays a role in suppressing p53 activities in
the colorectal, esophageal, and gastric cancers. However, most human tumors with increased
GNL3L also show a paradoxical increase of Bax, even though GNL3L knockdown increases
Bax more than 14-3-3σ or p21 in HCT116 cells. Considering the cell type complexity of
human cancer samples, this result may not exclude the role of Bax in mediating the GNL3L
effect in primary tumors. It is worthy of note that MDM2 can also be regulated by other
nucleolar proteins, including ARF (alternative reading frame), B23, L5, L11, and L23 (Dai
et al., 2008; Dai et al., 2004; Jin et al., 2004; Kurki et al., 2004; Meng et al., 2008; Tao &
Levine, 1999; Zhang et al., 2003). Most of these proteins stabilize p53 by inhibiting or
sequestering MDM2 in the nucleolus. In colorectal tumors, the levels of ARF, B23, L5, L11,
and L23 genes are either up-regulated or not changed, which raises the possibility that
GNL3L may be a key factor in suppressing the p53 activity in these tumors.
NS depletion is associated with a compensatory up-regulation of GNL3L

Author Manuscript

This new discovery was first made in the knockdown experiment. Besides siRNA
knockdown, there are only two physiological events known so far that can reduce the
expression of NS, i.e. cell differentiation (Tsai & McKay, 2002) and guanine nucleotide
depletion (Huang et al., 2009). Indeed, the decrease of NS expression during neural
differentiation is accompanied by a reciprocal increase of GNL3L expression (Tsai,
unpublished data). Here, we also observe that guanine nucleotide depletion can trigger NS
decrease and GNL3L increase simultaneously, and that this increase of GNL3L can be
reversed by MG132 treatment but not by restoring the level of NS protein, which argues
against a direct control over GNL3L expression by NS. Importantly, this phenomenon does
not occur in all cancer cell lines. It appears in HCT116 and U2OS cells, but not in HeLa or
HEK293 cells. Considering that HCT116 and U2OS cells are Rb1-wild-type and p16inactive, HeLa cells are Rb1-inactive and p16-wild-type, and HEK293 cells are Rb1-wildtype and p16-wild-type, this cell type-dependent up-regulation of GNL3L by NS
knockdown should not involve the p53 and Rb1 pathways and may explain some of the cell
type-specific phenotypes of NS knockdown (Nikpour et al., 2009). It also suggests that some
cells may survive the consequence of NS depletion better than others in the events where NS
and GNL3L share redundant functions, such as MDM2 regulation.

Conclusion
Author Manuscript

MDM2 is a key regulator of p53, which arguably is the most important tumor suppressor
gene in the genome. Our data demonstrate that GNL3L stabilizes MDM2 by inhibiting its
ubiquitylation and that depletion of GNL3L causes G2/M arrest and up- regulation of Bax,
14-3-3σ, and p21. Compared to the NS effect, the MDM2-regulatory activity of GNL3L
does not so much depend on the nucleolar release mechanism as NS does and behaves as a
basal regulator of MDM2. Our work shows that NS and GNL3L are two nucleolar proteins
that uniquely stabilize MDM2 and suppress p53 activities, and may play a role in promoting
tumor formation in human colorectal carcinomas.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and antibodies
HCT116 and U2OS cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium plus 10% FBS. Other cell
lines were maintained in DMEM plus 10% FBS. Early S-phase synchronization was
achieved by incubation with 2mM thymidine for 20h. Mitotic arrest was done by incubation
with 0.5uM nocodazole for 20h. Primary antibodies include anti-HA (HA.11), Myc (9E10),
FLAG (M2), α-tubulin (Sigma), MDM2 (SMP-14), p53 (DO-1), p-Cdc2 (Y15, Cell
Signaling), p-Histone H3 (S10, Upstate), NS (Ab2438, Ab1164, and Ab138), and GNL3L
(Ab134 and Ab3404).
Coimmunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

Cells were harvested in NTEN buffer. Lysates were incubated with primary antibody for 1
hour at 4C, followed by incubation with protein G sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for an
additional 4 hours at 4C. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with RIPA buffer before
SDS-PAGE and western detection.
siRNA knockdown of NS and GNL3L
Transient knockdown experiments were performed by either Lipofectamine-mediated
transfection of shRNAmir constructs or Oligofectamine-mediated transfection of siRNA
duplexes. Designs for NS and GNL3L-specific siRNAs and shRNAs were described
previously (Meng et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2009).
FLIP (Fluorescence Loss In Photobleaching)

Author Manuscript

FLIP experiments were performed in HCT116-8 cells using the same setup as described
previously (Meng et al., 2007). A nucleolus of 3-um diameter was bleached with repetitive
pulses at 70% power of the 488 nm Argon laser. The relative fluorescence index (RFI) in the
nucleoplasm of bleached cells was normalized to the nucleoplasmic intensity of neighboring
non-bleached cells after background subtraction using the following calculation: RFI=(I(t)/
I(0))*(C(0)/C(t)), where I(t) and I(0) are the background-subtracted intensities in the bleached
cell at time point t and before photobleaching. C(t) and C(0) are the background-subtracted
intensities in the neighboring control cell at time point t and before photobleaching. FLIP
data represent the average of 27–30 cells from 4–5 independent experiments.
Protein degradation and in vivo ubiquitylation assays

Author Manuscript

The cycloheximide protein degradation and in vivo ubiquitylation assays were performed as
described before (Meng et al., 2008). For overexpression protein degradation experiments,
Myc-tagged MDM2 was coexpressed with GNL3L in H1299 cells, which express little
MDM2. For knockdown protein degradation experiments, the endogenous MDM2 and p53
proteins were measured in HCT116-8 cells.

Cell-cycle analysis

Author Manuscript

Cell-cycle profiles were analyzed by counting the PI-labeled cells with a COULTER EPICS
XL flow cytometer and the XL System II software. Each cell-cycle profile was compiled
from 2×104-gated events and analyzed using the Multi Cycle AV software.
Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses

Author Manuscript

Total RNAs (5ug) were reversed transcribed into 1st strand cDNAs using random hexamers
and M-MLV reverse transcriptase. For qPCR, the ΔC(t) values between the target message
and the reference message (Rplp0) were determined by the MyiQ single-color real-time
PCR detection system and supermix SYBR green reagent. The ΔΔC(t) values were
measured from three biological replicates and two technical repeats (n=6) to compare the
relative expression levels of target sequences between different groups. All final results were
confirmed by comparing to a second reference message, HMG-14.

Figure 1. GNL3L competes against NS for MDM2 binding

Author Manuscript

(a) MDM2 (Myc) and NS family proteins (HA) were co-immunoprecipitated (coIP) and
immunoblotted (IB) by anti-tag antibodies in HEK293 cells. The results showed that MDM2
preferentially interacts with NS and GNL3L. (b) Endogenous binding between MDM2 and
GNL3L was demonstrated by anti-MDM2 (left panel) and anti-GNL3L (right panel) coIP
experiments. IgG and preimmune serum (pre-I) precipitated samples were used as controls.
(c) Anti-FLAG coIP of GNL3L (HA), NS (Myc), and MDM2 (FLAG) showed that GNL3L
and NS compete against each other for MDM2 binding. By comparison, GNL3L shows
more binding with MDM2 than wild-type NS does (left panel) and less binding with MDM2
than NS-G256V does (right panel). NS-G256V is a nucleoplasm-mislocalized mutant of NS
(Fig. S1b3). (d) Triple coIP of GNL3L (HA), MDM2 (FLAG), and p53 (Myc) by anti-HA
(left panel) or anti-Myc antibody (right panel) shows that GNL3L may bind p53 indirectly
through MDM2.

Figure 3. GNL3L stabilizes MDM2 protein by preventing its ubiquitylation

Author Manuscript

(a) Transient siRNA knockdown of GNL3L (siG3-2) in HeLa cells decreases the level of
endogenous MDM2 proteins. This effect can be reversed by coexpression of a siG3-2resistant GNL3L, G3L-siR. (b) Coexpression of GNL3L (HA) increases the protein level of
endogenous MDM2 in a dose-dependent manner. (c) The effect of GNL3L on MDM2
protein stability was determined in H1299 cells transfected with MDM2 alone (Ctrl) or
cotransfected with MDM2 and GNL3L (G3L). After cycloheximide treatment, the MDM2
protein amounts were measured, adjusted by their α-tubulin amounts, and expressed as
percentages of the MDM2 protein amount at the 0h time-point (bottom). (d) The
cycloheximide experiment showed that GNL3L knockdown in HCT116-8 cells significantly
reduces the protein stability of endogenous MDM2 (n=3, p<0.005, Repeated Measures
ANOVA) without affecting the stability of endogenous p53 (p=0.27). (e) HEK293 cells
were transfected with the (His)6-tagged ubiquitin, MDM2 and a control (shScr) or GNL3Lspecific (shG3-a) shRNAmir construct. Ubiquitylated MDM2 products were precipitated by
Ni2+ sepharose (His PD) and detected by anti-MDM2 antibody. GNL3L depletion increases
the ubiquitylation of MDM2, and this effect can be rescued by an shRNA-resistant GNL3L
(G3L-shR). (f) Overexpression of wild-type GNL3L decreases MDM2 polyubiquitylation
compared to the control sample. (g) GNL3L knockdown (left panel) or overexpression (right
panel) has no effect on the MDM2-induced p53 ubiquitylation.

Figure 4. GNL3L colocalizes with MDM2 in the nucleoplasm. Knockdown of GNL3L increases
the nucleolar-nucleoplasmic exchange rate of MDM2

Author Manuscript

(a) Confocal studies showed that GFP-fused GNL3L and FLAG-tagged MDM2 colocalize
in the nucleoplasm of HCT116-8 cells and that coexpression of these two proteins does not
change each other's distributions. Anti-fibrillarin staining labels the nucleolus in singly
transfected cells. Bars show 5um. (b1) The exchange rate between the nucleolar and
nucleoplasmic pools of MDM2 was measured in HCT116-8 cells by FLIP (fluorescence loss
in photobleaching). The nucleolar signal of GFP-fused MDM2 was bleached repeatedly
(circle) and the nucleoplasmic signal was recorded (rectangle). Time-sequenced images and
their time intervals (in seconds) to the first bleaching pulse were shown. (b2) Knockdown of
GNL3L (G3L-KD, in red) significantly increases the nucleolar-nucleoplasmic exchange rate
of MDM2 (p < 0.01). (b3) Overexperssion of GNL3L exerts only a small effect on
decreasing the exchange rate of MDM2 (p = 0.05). Error bars represent s.e.m. shown in one
direction (arrows in graph). Y-axis represents the relative fluorescence index (RFI). Top
arrows indicate bleaching pulses.

Figure 5. The activity of GNL3L in regulating MDM2 ubiquitylation is constitutively active and
less controlled by the nucleolar release mechanism than NS is

(a) For in vivo ubiquitylation assays, HEK293 cells were transfected with the (His)6- tagged
ubiquitin, MDM2 (Myc), and GNL3L or NS-specific shRNA constructs. GNL3L
knockdown shows a stronger effect in increasing MDM2 ubiquitylation than NS does. (b)
The effects of GNL3L and NS overexpression on MDM2 ubiquitylation were compared
using the same assay. Overexpression of wild-type and nucleoplasmic forms (G3L-dB and
G3L-G253V) of GNL3L shows the same effect in decreasing the ubiquitylation of MDM2.
On the other hand, nucleoplasmic forms of NS (NS-dB and NS-G256V) show much
stronger effects compared not only to wild-type NS but also to wild-type and mutant
GNL3L. (c) Endogenous coIP of MDM2 and GNL3L (or NS) showed that mitosis increases
the coIP efficiency of NS and MDM2 more than it does on the coIP of GNL3L and MDM2.

Figure 6. GNL3L knockdown triggers G2/M arrest and p53 activation

(a) The cell cycle phenotypes of control (siScr) and GNL3L (siG3L) knockdown were
analyzed by propidium-iodide-labeled flow cytometry in HCT116-8 (p53+/+) and HCT116-2
(p53−/−) cells. GNL3L knockdown triggers G2/M arrest more in the p53+/+ cells than in the
p53−/− cells. (b) Western blots confirm GNL3L knockdown efficiencies and reveal a slight
decrease of MDM2 proteins in the p53-wild-type and null cells and an increase of phosphoCdc2 (Y15) in the p53-wild-type cells by GNL3L knockdown. (c) The GNL3L knockdown
effect on the p53 activity was determined by quantitative RT-PCR assays of several p53
downstream targets. GNL3L depletion up-regulates Bax, 14-3-3-σ, and p21 in a p53dependent manner. *, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.001; ***, p < 0.0001.

Figure 7. NS depletion triggers a compensatory up-regulation of GNL3L in HCT116 and U2OS
cells

Author Manuscript

(a1) qRT-PCR measurements revealed a compensatory up-regulation of GNL3L transcripts
following NS knockdown in p53-wild-type and null HCT116 cells and U2OS cells but not
in HeLa or HEK293 cells. Conversely, GNL3L knockdown shows no such effect on NS.
(a2) The increase of GNL3L expression by NS knockdown was confirmed by western blots.
(b) Mycophenolic acid (MPA) treatment triggers a reciprocal increase of GNL3L and
decrease of NS in HCT116-8 and 2 cells. The MPA-induced GNL3L up-regulation can be
reversed by MG132 treatment but not by NS overexpression. (c) GNL3L can functionally
rescue the MDM2 ubiquitylation phenotype of NS-knockdown cells. (d) GNL3L and NS
form a complex regulatory network on the MDM2-p53 pathway. Both proteins show similar
activities in MDM2 stabilization but differ in their modes of regulation. Multiple points of
feedback and cross-regulation exist. Arrows and X’s indicate excitatory or inhibitory
functions, respectively, and the dashed line represents an event regulated by the nucleolar
release mechanism.
