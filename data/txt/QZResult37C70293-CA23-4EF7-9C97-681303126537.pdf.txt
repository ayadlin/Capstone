ABSTRACT:
Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2) expression correlates with
tumor growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance in gastric cancer. Here, we show
that RhoGDI2 functions in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is
responsible for invasiveness during tumor progression. This tumorigenic activity
is associated with repression of E-cadherin by RhoGDI2 via upregulation of Snail.
Overexpression of RhoGDI2 induced phenotypic changes consistent with EMT in
gastric cancer cells, including abnormal epithelial cell morphology, fibroblastlike properties, and reduced intercellular adhesion. RhoGDI2 overexpression also
resulted in decreased expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and β-catenin
and increased expression of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin.
Importantly, RhoGDI2 overexpression also stimulated the expression of Snail, a
repressor of E-cadherin and inducer of EMT, but not other family members such as
Slug or Twist. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Snail expression suppressed
RhoGDI2-induced EMT and invasion, confirming that the effect was Snail-specific.
These results indicate that RhoGDI2 plays a critical role in tumor progression in
gastric cancer through induction of EMT. Targeting RhoGDI2 may thus be a useful
strategy to inhibit gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

in the cytoplasm, retaining them in their inactive form and
thus preventing interaction with target effector proteins
[2, 3]. However, recent reports suggest that RhoGDIs
also act as positive regulators of Rho GTPases as they
are associated with active forms of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42
[4, 5]. These positive interactions maintain Rho in an
active form by inhibiting both intrinsic and GTPaseactivating protein-stimulated GTPase activities of Rho
GTPases. Unlike other members of the family (such as
RhoGDI1 and RhoGDI3), RhoGDI2 is preferentially
expressed in hematopoietic cells, and seems to have
a narrow selectivity and lower binding affinity for
Rho GTPases [6]. A significant role of RhoGDI2 in
cancer has previously been identified in several studies.

Though incidence and mortality of gastric cancer
have steadily declined in recent decades, it remains the
fourth most common type of cancer and the second leading
cause of cancer mortality worldwide [1]. Metastasis is
still the major cause of mortality in patients with cancer,
despite advancements in understanding and treatment of
cancer over the last decade. Determining the molecular
mechanisms underlying metastatic progression of gastric
cancer may provide insights into new therapeutic targets.
Rho GDP dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs)
were originally identified as negative regulators of Rho
GTPases because they bind to a majority of Rho GTPases

RhoGDI2 expression is inversely correlated with invasive
capacity in bladder cancer cell lines [7], and reduced
RhoGDI2 expression is associated with poor prognosis
patients with advanced bladder cancer [8]. In contrast,
RhoGDI2 mRNA expression is significantly higher in
ovarian adenocarcinomas than in benign adenomas [9].
Consistent with this finding, RhoGDI2 is overexpressed
in human breast cancer cell lines, and it increases cancer
cell invasiveness and motility in vitro [10]. We have also
shown that RhoGDI2 expression is positively correlated
with tumor progression and metastatic potential in gastric
cancer [11].
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an
essential morphologic conversion that occurs during
embryonic development. There is increasing evidence
that a similar process occurs during cancer progression, by
which tumor cells acquire the capacity to migrate, invade,
and metastasize [12]. It has been shown that EMT can be
induced by signaling from several growth factor receptors
and chemokine receptors [13-15]. Loss of cell-cell
adhesion is a prerequisite of EMT and involves functional
loss of E-cadherin. The zinc finger transcription factors of
the Snail family have been implicated in this repression
[16-18]. Currently these important EMT drivers, which
have a central role in the biological significance to EMT
activation, are shown to correlate significantly with poor
clinical prognosis in various types of cancers [19-22].
In this study, we show for the first time involvement

of RhoGDI2 in EMT of human gastric cancer cells. We
also present evidence suggesting that this tumorigenic
activity is associated with the ability of RhoGDI2 to
repress E-cadherin via upregulation of Snail expression.

RESULTS
RhoGDI2 induces EMT in gastric cancer cells
RhoGDI2 promotes tumor growth and malignant
progression in gastric cancer [11], and induction of
EMT is associated with tumor progression and poor
prognosis in gastric cancer [23]. We therefore examined
whether RhoGDI2 may be involved in the control of
EMT in gastric cancer cells using SNU-484 cells in
which RhoGDI2, which is not normally expressed, was
ectopically overexpressed and have increased invasive and
metastatic ability [11]. Interestingly, the morphology of
RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-4 and GDI25) cells was distinct from that of control (Mock) cells.
While control cells remained tightly attached with typical
epithelial cell characteristics, RhoGDI2-overexpressing
SNU-484 cells were more spread out, and lost their cellcell contacts (Fig. 1A, upper). Confocal microscopy of
phalloidin-stained cells also confirmed the presence of
filopodia, lammelopodia, and microspikes in RhoGDI2-

overexpressing SNU-484 cells, while control cells showed
less staining with no cellular outgrowth (Fig. 1A, lower).
To investigate the mechanism underlying the
morphological changes, we examined the expression
of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and β-catenin) and
mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin).
Protein levels of epithelial markers were significantly
decreased, whereas levels of mesenchymal markers
were significantly increased in RhoGDI2-overexpressing
SNU-484 cells compared with control cells (Fig.
1B). Immunofluorescence analysis also revealed less
E-cadherin staining in the cell membrane region and
a higher level of vimentin staining in the cytoplasmic
region in RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484 cells (Fig.
1C). These results suggest that RhoGDI2 acts as a positive
regulator of EMT in gastric cancer cells.

The zinc finger-containing proteins Snail and Slug and
the helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist repress
E-cadherin expression and induce EMT in gastric cancer
[24-26]. We thus assessed the expression levels of the
above E-cadherin regulators in RhoGDI2-overexpressing
SNU-484 cells to determine the effect of RhoGDI2. We
found no differences in the expression of Slug and Twist
(Fig. 2C), but Snail mRNA and protein expression was
increased in RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484 cells
(Fig. 2C and D). We also found that transient expression of
RhoGDI2 in HEK293T cells increases Snail and decreases
E-cadherin, as well as decreasing promoter activity of
the E-cadherin gene (Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting
that Snail is a direct target of RhoGDI2. Furthermore, we
found that the increased Snail protein is localized in the
nucleus of RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484 cells (Fig.
2E). These results suggest that Snail is positively regulated
by RhoGDI2 and that Snail might play an important role
in RhoGDI2-induced gastric cancer cell EMT.

RhoGDI2 induces Snail expression
A hallmark of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin.
Transcription of the E-cadherin gene is silenced in various
carcinomas, and it is thought to be a tumor suppressor
[12]. mRNA expression and promoter activity of the
E-cadherin gene are markedly repressed in RhoGDI2overexpressing SNU-484 (GDI2-4 and GDI2-5) cells
compared with control (Mock) cells (Fig. 2A and B).

Snail is essential for RhoGDI2-induced EMT in
gastric cancer cells
To investigate whether Snail is an important
mediator for RhoGDI2-induced EMT in gastric cancer
cells, expression of Snail was downregulated in RhoGDI2-

overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-5) cells by lentiviral
shRNA (shSnail-1 and shSnail-2). Depletion of Snail
expression resulted in reversal of the EMT-associated
morphological changes induced by ectopic expression of
RhoGDI2. Snail-depleted RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU484(GDI2-5) cells (shSnail-1 and shSnail-2) were tightly
attached, showing typical epithelial cell characteristics,
with no cellular outgrowth (Fig. 3A). Repression of
epithelial markers (E-cadherin and β-catenin) and
enhanced expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin
and fibronectin) in RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU484(GDI2-5) cells was rescued through the knockdown
of Snail expression (Fig. 3B and C). The above results
suggest that upregulation of Snail expression is critical for
the induction of EMT in RhoGDI2-overexpressing gastric
cancer cells.

decreased the invasiveness of RhoGDI2-overexpressing
SNU-484(GDI2-5) cells (shSnail-1 and shSnail-2)
compared with control (shCon) cells (Fig. 4A). Next, we
checked the migration ability of Snail-depleted SNU484(GDI2-5) cells by using a wound healing assay. For
this analysis, we used a culture-insert, where a nonbias cell-free gap is produced as the “wound” when the
culture-insert is removed. Immediately after removal of
the culture-insert, cell images were obtained at various
time points (0-30 h) under a light microscope. After
24 h, complete wound closure (100%) was achieved in
RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-5) control
(shCon) cells, whereas only 11% (shSnail-1) and 47%
(shSnail-2) wound closure was achieved in Snail-depleted
SNU-484(GDI2-5) cells (Fig. 4B and C). Taken together,
these results suggest that upregulation of Snail expression
plays a key role in RhoGDI2-induced gastric cancer cell
migration and invasion. To exclude the possibility that the
effect of Snail on migration and invasion of RhoGDI2overexpressing gastric cancer cells was attributable to
different proliferation rates, we compared growth rates
of Snail-depleted SNU-484(GDI2-5) cells (shSnail-1
and shSnail-2) with those of control (shCon) cells. Under
identical growth conditions, all cells exhibited similar
growth rates (Fig. 4D), indicating that the decreased
migration and invasion via depletion of Snail expression

Downregulation of Snail suppresses RhoGDI2induced gastric cancer cell invasion and migration
Since RhoGDI2 promotes gastric cancer cell
invasion [11], we examined whether depletion of Snail
expression could alter the migration and invasive
properties of RhoGDI2-overexpressing gastric cancer
cells. Downregulation of Snail expression considerably

effect on Snail expression. NF-κB activity was markedly
suppressed by inhibition of Rac1 activity (Fig. 5D). Taken
together, these results suggest that RhoGDI2-mediated
Rac1 activation is important for NF-κB activation, which
induces Snail upregulation in gastric cancer cells.

RhoGDI2 increases Snail expression through
Rac1-mediated NF-kB activation
NF-κB is directly involved in transcriptional
regulation of Snail expression [27-29], and thus we
examined the involvement of NF-κB in RhoGDI2-induced
Snail expression in gastric cancer cells. We found that
NF-κB activity was significantly higher in RhoGDI2overexpressing cells than that in control cells (Fig. 5A),
and that suppression of NF-κB activity by IKK inhibitor
III (BMS-345541) significantly reduced Snail expression
in RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-4 and
GDI2-5) cells (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that NFκB activation is important for RhoGDI2-induced Snail
upregulation in gastric cancer cells.
RhoGDI2 is a critical regulator of Rac1 in many
cancer cells [30, 31] and PLCγ is activated by RhoGDI2
expression in gastric cancer cells [32]. We therefore
examined whether suppression of Rac1 or PLC activity
affects Snail expression in RhoGDI2-overexpressing
gastric cancer cells. Suppression of Rac1 activity by
NSC23766 significantly inhibited Snail expression in
RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-4 and GDI25) cells (Fig. 5C); however, PLC inhibitor U73122 had no

Snail is not required for RhoGDI2-induced
chemoresistance in gastric cancer cells
We previously showed that RhoGDI2 protects
gastric cancer cells against apoptosis induced by various
chemotherapeutic agents [33-35], as well as promotes
gastric cancer cell invasion. Furthermore, Snail mediates
chemoresistance in many cancer cell types [36-39]. To
determine whether upregulation of Snail expression is
required for RhoGDI2-induced chemoresistance in gastric
cancer cells, we used various chemotherapeutic drugs
such as cisplatin, etoposide, staurosporin, 5-fluorouracil,
paclitaxel, and doxorubicin to treat Snail-depleted
RhoGDI2-overexpressing gastric cancer cells. Consistent
with our previous results, overexpression of RhoGDI2
resulted in increased cell viability compared with control
cells (Fig. 6) [33]; however, depletion of Snail expression
did not change viability of RhoGDI2-overexpressing
gastric cancer cells in response to chemotherapeutic drugs
(Fig. 6). These results indicate that upregulation of Snail

in the T24 human bladder cancer cell line, but not in the
more aggressive T24T lineage, and that forced expression
of RhoGDI2 in highly aggressive T24T cells suppresses
cancer cell invasion, motility, and lung metastasis [41, 7].
Together these data implicate RhoGDI2 as a metastasis
suppressor in bladder cancer. However, other lines of
research have suggested that RhoGDI2 is also associated
with advanced stage tumors and increased metastatic
potential of tumor cells in ovarian and breast cancers [9,
10]. Our previous work suggests that increased RhoGDI2
expression is associated with advanced stage gastric
tumors and lymph node metastasis [11].
While there are many reports implicating RhoGDI2
in tumor growth and malignant progression in numerous
cancer types, the exact mechanism of RhoGDI2 in tumor
growth and malignant progression is poorly understood.
To identify possible mechanisms for RhoGDI2-induced
invasion and migration in gastric cancer cells, we
examined the effects of RhoGDI2 overexpression on
EMT. EMT, as evidenced by drastic changes in cell
morphology and reversal of the expression of epithelial
markers (E-cadherin and β-catenin) and mesenchymal
markers (vimentin and fibronectin), was activated in
RhoGDI2-overexpressing gastric cancer cells. RhoGDI2
is known to be increased in gastric cancer cell invasion
and migration, but it has not been determined whether
RhoGDI2 overexpression results in EMT in gastric cancer

DISCUSSION
EMT is a critical cellular mechanism during tumor
progression and metastasis development and results
in enhanced cell motility and invasion. However, few
studies have examined the possible role of EMT in gastric
cancer [23-26]. Here, we show that RhoGDI2, which
is frequently overexpressed in advanced stage gastric
cancer, is an important mediator of EMT. Furthermore,
we demonstrated the mechanism by which RhoGDI2
increases Snail expression. RhoGDI2 activates NF-κB in
a Rac1-dependent manner; activated NF-κB is critical for
Snail upregulation in RhoGDI2-overexpressing gastric
cancer cells, indicating the central role of RhoGDI2 in
regulating Snail expression and consequently EMT.
Accumulating evidence suggests that RhoGDI2
is differentially expressed in human cancers [6]. For
example, RhoGDI2 is selectively downregulated in
Hodgkin lymphoma cells when compared with nonHodgkin lymphoma cells, and this loss of RhoGDI2
expression may contribute to the resistance to apoptosis
in Hodgkin lymphoma cells [40]. Similarly, Theodorescu
and colleagues have shown the expression of RhoGDI2

cells. This is the first report, to our knowledge, suggesting
that RhoGDI2 can induce EMT.
In our study, RhoGDI2-induced EMT was
associated with increased Snail gene expression, known to
be a main contributor to E-cadherin suppression. A series
of recent reports showed that NF-κB is directly involved
in the transcriptional regulation of Snail expression [2729], and NF-κB activation is also involved in EMT [4244]. Overexpression of the active subunit of NF-κB,
p65, is sufficient for induction of EMT [42] and NF-κB
signaling is required for transcriptional activation of the
Snail gene by GSK-3 inhibition [45]. Similarly, Kim et
al. showed that Snail expression is regulated by NF-κB
during EMT in MCF10A cells overexpressing insulin-like
growth factor receptors [46]. In our study, we investigated
a potential role for NF-κB in Snail gene expression. Basal
NF-κB activity was significantly increased in RhoGDI2overexpressing gastric cancer cells and inhibition of
NF-κB activity resulted in marked reduction of Snail
expression. Therefore, RhoGDI2-induced EMT may result

from NF-κB-mediated Snail expression in gastric cancer
cells.
RhoGDIs are generally thought to be negative
regulators of Rho GTPases, which act through binding and
retaining Rho GTPases in inactive, cytosolic forms that
are unable to interact with downstream target molecules.
Zhang et al. recently showed that RhoGDI2 associates
with Rac1 in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells,
and RhoGDI2 depletion results in constitutive Rac1
activation [30]. However, several lines of evidence,
including ours, indicate that RhoGDI2 may act as a
positive regulator of Rac1. For example, Moissoglu et al.
recently described RhoGDI2 as an activator of Rac1 in
T24 and UMUC3 human bladder cancer cells [31]. Huang
et al. also showed that RhoGDI2 induces hypertrophic
growth and cell migration through Rac1 activation in
H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells [47], and interestingly, showed
that RhoGDI2 overexpression enhances Rac1 expression,
leading to increased levels of membrane-associated
Rac1. We also found that Rac1 is positively regulated
by RhoGDI2 in gastric cancer cells (data not shown)
and activated Rac1 mediates NF-κB activation, which
induces Snail upregulation in RhoGDI2-overexpressing
gastric cancer cells. Numerous studies suggest that Rac1
regulates intracellular ROS production via increased
NADPH oxidase activity, leading to NF-κB activation
[48-50]. Therefore, we are now examining whether
Rac1-dependent redox signals are involved in RhoGDI2mediated NF-κB activation and consequent Snail
expression.
Overall, the present study shows that RhoGDI2
overexpression is involved in acquisition of the
mesenchymal phenotype of gastric cancer cells, and that
Rac1-dependent NF-κB activation and subsequent Snail
expression is essential for induction of EMT.

for 48  h. The lower chamber was filled with 750 µl of
appropriated media containing 20% FBS. After incubation,
medium remaining on top of the insert were removed by
pipetting and non-invading cells on the upper surface of
the insert membrane were removed with cotton swab.
After washing twice with PBS, the insert membranes
were fixed for 10 min with MeOH/Acetic acid (3:1) at -20
and stained with 50 µg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) for
20 min at 37. The upper surface of the insert membrane
was gently scrubbed with cotton swab again and washed
with distilled water. Membranes were cut and mount on
slide glass and the number of invaded cells was counted
microscopically at 100-200 × magnification. For wound
healing assays, 4.9 × 104 cells in 70 µl of medium were
seeded into Culture-Insert (Ibidi). After the cells were
confluent, to inhibit the effect of cell proliferation, the
cells were pretreated with 10 µg/ml mitomycin C (Sigma)
for 2 h, and washed with culture medium. After removal
of Culture-Insert, cells were incubated with fresh media
and photographs of the migration assay were taken at 0,
5, 15, 20, 25 and 30 h using a phase-contrast microscope
with digital camera. The cell migration was quantified
by calculating the cell-covered area using WimScratch
software (Wimasis).

Proliferation assay
The cells were placed in a 6-well plate at a
concentration of 3 × 104 cells per well. After incubation for
1 to 4 days, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 3 ml
of appropriate medium. Cell suspensions were centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1
ml of appropriate medium. The viable cells were counted
with a hemocytometer after trypan blue staining.
