ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer in women worldwide. In the
present study, global microRNA profiling for 79 cervical cancer patient samples led to
the identification of miR-218 down-regulation in cervical cancer tissues compared to
normal cervical tissues. Lower miR-218 expression was associated significantly with
worse overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and pelvic/aortic lymph node
recurrence. In vitro, miR-218 over-expression decreased clonogenicity, migration, and
invasion. Survivin (BIRC5) was subsequently identified as an important cervical cancer
target of miR-218 using in silico prediction, mRNA profiling, and quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR). Concordant with miR-218 over-expression, survivin knockdown
by siRNA decreased clonogenicity, migration, and invasion. YM155, a small molecule
survivin inhibitor, significantly suppressed tumor growth and lymph node metastasis
in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that the miR-218~survivin axis inhibits cervical
cancer progression by regulating clonogenicity, migration, and invasion, and suggest
that the inhibition of survivin could be a potential therapeutic strategy to improve
outcome in this disease.

INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that
post-transcriptionally down-regulate the expression
of multiple target genes [8]. MicroRNA dysregulation
occurs in numerous human malignancies and is associated
with altered malignant potential; affecting survival,
proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion [9]. Recently,
global profiling studies have enabled microRNA-based
stratifications of cancer types and patient outcomes [10,
11]. However, the function and target genes of many
microRNAs remain to be elucidated; this characterization
is fundamentally necessary in order to acquire a deeper
understanding of cancer progression.
MicroRNA-218 (miR-218) down-regulation has
been reported in several human malignancies, including
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and gastric cancer [12-15]. In
cervical cancer, lower miR-218 serum levels have been

Cervical cancer is the third most common
cancer in women globally [1]. In patients with locally
advanced cervical cancer, cisplatin-based concurrent
chemoradiotherapy can improve overall survival,
progression free survival, and recurrence rates [2-4];
however, the 5-year survival rates for stage III and
IV patients remains at less than 40% [5]. Moreover,
approximately 30% of patients experience lymph
node recurrence and distant metastasis after primary
treatment [6]. The ability to prevent lymph node and
distant metastasis remains an important yet unresolved
therapeutic goal for these patients. Recent molecularly
targeted therapeutics have shown potential in decreasing
metastasis and improving survival for several human
malignancies [7]; however, no proven drugs yet exist for
cervical cancer.

described to be associated with tumor invasion [16].
Thus, miR-218 is a clinically important and interesting
microRNA for investigation.
In the current study, new miR-218-related
associations were identified in clinically annotated cervical
cancer samples. Furthermore, the cellular and molecular
functions of miR-218 and one of its key targets, survivin
(BIRC5), were elucidated. Lastly, we validated these
observations in vitro and in vivo using a small molecule
survivin suppressant (YM155), and provide data in
support of targeting the miR-218~survivin axis in cancer
therapy and preventing metastasis.

with a median follow-up time of 6 years. We therefore
investigated the association between miR-218 expression
with patient survival. Initially, the median miR-218
expression value was utilized to divide the 79 cervical
cancer patients into high vs. low expression groups (miR218 highmedian, n=39; miR-218 lowmedian, n=40). The miR218 low expression group experienced a worse overall
survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) (OS
P=0.074; DFS P=0.079, Figure S1), but the data were
of borderline statistical significance. The groups were
then re-divided, based on the lowest level of miR-218
expression measured in the normal cervix population.
This resulted in 35 patients with high miR-218 expression
vs. 44 with low miR-218 expression. Using this new cutoff level, the low miR-218 expression group experienced
a significantly poorer outcome with regards to both OS
and DFS (OS P=0.009; DFS P=0.014; Figure 1B). These
data suggest that cervical cancer patients with lower miR218 expression levels than detected in normal cervical
epithelium tissues will experience a poor outcome.
Clinical factors were also analyzed for the miR-218
high vs. low expression groups (Table 1). The two groups
did not differ in age, tumor size, International Federation
of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging, or distant
metastasis. Of note however, miR-218 down-regulation
was strongly associated with pelvic and para-aortic lymph
node recurrence (P=0.032 and P=0.013, respectively), as

RESULTS

Analysis of Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA)
data determined that expression of miR-218 was
significantly reduced in 79 cervical cancer tissues
compared to 11 normal cervix tissues (P<0.001; Figure
1A). Further details of this study have been described
in How et al. [17]; in brief, these patients have all
been treated for cure (radiation and chemotherapy)

by greater than 2 fold were 35 candidate targets (Figure
3A; Table S1). For these candidate targets, their in silico
prediction scores and expression levels were used to rank
the genes independently, then these ranks were summed
for a cumulative final rank (Table S1).
The top 10 candidate target genes from Table S1
were then assayed in the SiHa and ME-180 cells using
qRT-PCR after 48 hrs of miR-218 transfection, with miRNC transfection as a control (Figure S3). Survivin was
the most consistently and significantly reduced target
after miR-218 transfection in both cell lines (Figure S3;
re-presented in Figure 3B, left panel). Correspondingly,
miR-218 over-expression also reduced survivin protein
expression (Figure 3B, right panel).
In order to confirm direct targeting and binding
between miR-218 and the survivin 3’-untranslated region
(3’-UTR), we cloned the survivin 3’-UTR (which included
a miR-218 predicted binding site) into the pMIR-REPORT
luciferase vector (Figure 3C). Cells transfected with wild
type survivin 3’-UTR pMIR-REPORT vector (survivinWT) showed a significant reduction in luciferase activity
in both SiHa and ME-180 cells (P<0.05 relative to empty
pMIR-REPORT vector, Figure 3D). These inhibitory
effects were not observed with a mutant survivin 3’UTR pMIR-REPORT vector (survivin-MT; containing a
mutation in the miR-218 binding site), thereby confirming
specific and direct survivin 3’-UTR targeting by miR-218.

Deletion of miR-218 genomic loci in cervical
cancer
In other cancers, miR-218 down-regulation is
known to occur through promoter hypermethylation
or genomic loss [12, 13, 18]. In order to elucidate the
mechanism of miR-218 down-regulation in cervical
cancer, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) genomic data
(SNP arrays) and epigenetic data (methylation profiles)
from 105 cervical squamous cell carcinoma samples were
analyzed. Copy number data indicated that most patients’
miR-218 genomic loci were deleted (hsa-miR-218-1:
50%, hsa-miR-218-2: 31%, Figure 1C). Methylation and
microRNA sequencing data were also analyzed, but no
correlations were observed between miR-218 methylation
and miR-218 expression level (data not shown). Overall,
these data suggest that in cervical cancer, reduced miR218 expression level is likely related to deletion of the
miR-218 loci.

miR-218 reduced cell survival, migration, and
invasion in vitro
In order to elucidate the biological significance of
miR-218 down-regulation, SiHa and ME-180 cells, which
are both human papillomavirus (HPV) positive cervical
squamous cell carcinoma lines, were transfected with premiR negative control (miR-NC) or pre-miR-218 (miR218). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, miR-218 was
over-expressed by more than 200-fold in SiHa and ME180 cells (P<0.01, Figure S2). In both cell lines, this overexpression significantly reduced clonogenicity (P<0.05,
Figure 2A).
Because miR-218 down-regulation was observed to
be associated with lymph node metastasis and recurrence
in our patients, we performed migration and invasion
assays. Consistent with the clinical data, miR-218 overexpression reduced migration and invasion capacities of
both SiHa and ME-180 cells (P<0.05; Figures 2B and 2C).

Survivin knockdown reduced survival, migration,
and invasion in cervical cancer cells
Survivin is the smallest member of the inhibitor
of apoptosis (IAP) family, and is mainly associated with
the regulation of mitosis and inhibition of apoptosis [21].
Some functions of survivin still remain unknown because
survivin interacts with numerous proteins. In order to
characterize survivin function in cervical cancer cells,
SiHa and ME-180 cells were transfected with survivin
siRNAs. Survivin knockdown was confirmed both at
the mRNA and protein level (Figure 4A). This downregulation was accompanied by a significant reduction in
clonogenicity compared to control cells transfected with
negative control siRNA (P<0.05; Figure 4B). Additionally,
survivin knockdown also reduced migration and invasion
capacities, phenocopying miR-218 over-expression
(P<0.05; Figures 4C and 4D). Overall, these data support
the postulate that the miR~218-survivin axis regulates
clonogenicity, migration, and invasion in cervical cancer.

Survivin is an important target of miR-218 in
cervical cancer cells
In order to identify biologically relevant miR-218
targets, we first examined in silico predicted targets using
miRDB (http://mirdb.org/miRDB/) [19, 20]. These data
were combined with mRNA array (GeneChip Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0) data generated from the same
79 cervical cancer tissues and 11 normal cervix tissues
used for TLDA [17]. At the intersection between the in
silico predicted targets and mRNAs that were up-regulated

Efficacy of a survivin targeting compound in
cervical cancer
In general, survivin is absent in normal adult cells
and only expressed in cancer cells; thus, survivin might
serve as a useful drug target [22]. Furthermore, if the miR1092

218~survivin axis regulates cervical cancer clonogenicity,
migration, and invasion, then in turn, a survivin
suppressant/inhibitor could be therapeutically important
in this disease. Although several survivin inhibitors exist
[22], we utilized the readily available YM155. This small
molecule suppresses survivin transcription and is currently
being assessed in several clinical trials for lymphoma,
prostate cancer, malignant melanoma, and NSCLC [23].
YM155 decreased survivin expression in both a
concentration and time dependent manner (Figure 5A).
As well, YM155 significantly reduced clonogenicity
of SiHa and ME-180 cells, which was comparable to
survivin siRNA (Figures 5B and 4B). In order to examine
the effects of YM155 against tumor growth and lymph
node metastasis in cervical cancer cells, we generated
luciferase-expressing ME-180 cells (Luc-ME-180 cells),
and evaluated in vivo anti-tumor activity. Mice treated
with YM155 had significantly reduced tumor growth
compared to control mice treated with saline (53%
reduction at day 22, P<0.05, Figure 5C). We evaluated
intratumoral survivin protein expression at days 0, 3, and
7, and confirmed inhibition of survivin expression during
YM155 treatment (compared to saline controls; Figure

S4A). Next, the inhibitory effect of YM155 on lymph node
metastases was examined using an orthotopic xenograft
model of cervical cancer [24]. After 28 days implantation,
the number of lymph node metastases in YM155 vs.
saline treated mice was evaluated using bioluminescence.
All metastatic lymph nodes detected by bioluminescence
were confirmed using histological analyses (Figure S4B).
Importantly, YM155 significantly reduced the number
of lymph node metastasis (P<0.05, Figure 5D), without
affecting the large primary tumor transplanted into the
cervix (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrated that miR-218 is
significantly down-regulated in human cervix cancer,
which in turn, was associated with poor OS and DFS,
as well as increased risk of lymph node recurrence. The
identified miR-218~survivin axis regulated clonogenicity,
migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells in vitro.
Furthermore, a small molecule survivin suppressant,
YM155 was able to reduce tumor growth and lymph node
metastasis in vivo.

miR-218 down-regulation has been reported in
several cancers [12-15]; it has been shown to inhibit
migration and invasion in gastric cancer [15], glioma
[25], head & neck [26], renal cell [27], and cervical
cancers [28]. Consistent with previous reports, in this
current study, we observed that miR-218 inhibited
migration, and invasion in cervical cancer cells. Our study
further validated and extended upon these findings both
clinically, by identifying the association with lymph node
involvement at presentation, nodal recurrence, OS, DFS;
and experimentally, by elucidating the role of survivin as a
downstream mediator of miR-218 under-expression.
The mechanism of miR-218 down-regulation
may depend on the type of cancer. To date, promoter

hypermethylation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [12] and
genomic deletion in non-small cell lung [18] and bladder
cancers [13] have been reported. Our analysis of the data
obtained from TCGA SNP arrays suggested that genomic
deletion of miR-218 loci is likely a mechanism for miR218 under-expression in cervical cancer. miR-218 is
located in two genomic loci; 4p15.31 (hsa-miR-218-1)
and 5q34 (hsa-miR-218-2), which are located within the
intronic regions of SLIT2 and SLIT3, respectively. Loss of
chromosome 4p has been previously reported in cervical
cancer [29], which interestingly, was also noted to be
associated with lymph node metastasis [29].
Several studies have identified miR-218 targets,
such as ROBO1 [15], IKK-β [25], Laminin-332 [26],

Rictor [30], and survivin [12]. We chose to focus only on a
single, key target of miR-218 in cervical cancer, identified
by combining in silico prediction and global mRNA array
data in order to evaluate this axis in some depth. Future
studies should delve into the relevance of the other targets
in similar model systems. For example, bioinformaticsrelated analyses may be expanded, and survivin-lacking
cells may be utilized to compare the contributing effects of
survivin vs. other targets in miR-218-induced phenotypes.
Survivin is an IAP and functions as an oncogene in
cancer cells due to its anti-apoptotic properties. The
main functions of survivin include inhibition of caspasedependent apoptosis and caspase-independent cell death,
as well as in the regulation of mitosis [21]. However, a
complete understanding of all of survivin’s functions

remains unclear since this protein interacts with a number
of other proteins with multi-functional effects [21].
Our data showed that survivin knockdown by
siRNA significantly reduced clonogenicity, migration,
and invasion in SiHa and ME-180 cells, phenocopying
the results of miR-218 over-expression. Survivin is known
to promote tumor cell invasion (in vitro) and metastasis
(in vivo), in cooperation with XIAP, another IAP family
member [22, 31]. Future work will be required to further
elucidate the detailed mechanisms by which survivin
affects migration and invasion.
Survivin is typically absent in normal adult cells
(except for germ cells), and is highly over-expressed in
cancer cells, thereby serving as a drug target. YM155 leads
to the repression of survivin promoter activity by binding

to the transcription factor ILF3 and disrupting the ILF/p54
complex [32]. Phase II clinical trials have been conducted
with YM155 alone or as part of combination therapy in
prostate cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and non-small
cell lung cancer patients [23]. Our data demonstrated
that YM155 significantly reduced survivin expression in
a concentration and time-dependent manner, and reduced
cell proliferation in vitro. We present the first orthotopic
metastatic model for YM155 evaluation, and demonstrated
that YM155 indeed reduced lymph node metastasis.
Primary tumor growth was reduced subcutaneously, but
not orthotopically. We speculate that the tumor size (large
donor tumors needed to be transplanted in the orthotopic
model), and/or the microenvironment might well account
for this discrepant observation. Other survivin-inhibiting
compounds are currently in development and might be
even more effective inhibitors [22]. Nonetheless, we have
demonstrated the proof-of-concept that such inhibitors
should be further explored in the prevention of metastasis
in this disease.
The role of the mir-218∼survivin axis in potentially
promoting nodal metastasis may suggest a therapeutic
opportunity for survivin inhibitors in treating nodepositive, locally advanced cancers, and/or cancers with
occult nodal involvement. Survivin inhibition may be
particularly helpful for adjuvant therapy used to inhibit
lymph node metastasis after primary tumor resection.
Further work will be required to investigate the use of
survivin inhibitors with existing standard treatments
(e.g., chemotherapy and/or radiation) for such disease.
Moreover, whether this therapeutic opportunity exists in
other cancers (e.g., head and neck, lung) remains to be
investigated.
In conclusion, the miR-218~survivin axis is pivotal,
both on a clinical and basic cellular level, in regulating
clonogenicity, migration, and invasion in cervical cancer.
Anti-survivin therapy might provide a potentially useful
strategy in partially restoring this axis, and thereby
improve outcome for patients with cervical cancer.

Seventy-nine cervical cancer tissues and 11
normal cervix tissues were collected from fresh frozen

Level 3 segmented copy number data for 105
cervical squamous cell carcinoma samples generated
by TCGA using SNP 6.0 arrays were downloaded from
the Broad Firehose website (2012_11_02 stdata Run).
Copy number data for miR-218 encoding loci were then

well, they were determined to be mycoplasma free every
3 months using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit
(Lonza).
SiHa and ME-180 cells were transfected with
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies), according

Generation of Luciferase Expressing ME-180
Cells (Luc-ME-180)

expression.

Western Blot Analysis
Total protein was extracted using RIPA buffer (50
mM TrisHCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40,
0.1% SDS), then separated using a Novex 4-20% TrisGlycine Gel (Life Technologies). Proteins were detected
using survivin (1:1000 dilution, Novus Biologicals) and
α-Tubulin (loading control, 1:40000 dilution, Sigma)
antibodies. Specific proteins were detected using
SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Thermo Scientific).

Luciferase containing lentivirus (Lenti-Luc) was
generated by transient transfection of 293T cells with
psPAX2, pCMV-VSVG (Addgene), and CSII-CMVBsd-Luciferase plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies). At 48 hrs after co-transfection, lentiviruscontaining supernatant was collected, and then passed
through a 0.45 µm filter. Cultured ME-180 cells were
incubated for 48 hrs with Lenti-Luc, then cultured for 2
weeks in the presence of 4.0 µg/mL Blasticidin S (Life
Technologies).

Viability and Clonogenic Assays

In Vivo Experiments

Cell viability was examined using the CellTiter 96
Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS assay,
Promega), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For
clonogenic assays, transfected cells were re-seeded 48
hrs post-transfection at low density in 6-well plates. Cells
were incubated for 10-14 days, then fixed and stained with
0.2% methylene blue in 50% methanol. The surviving
fraction was calculated by comparison with control cells.

Six to eight week-old severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) female mice were utilized for
all experiments. ME-180 or Luc-ME-180 (1 × 107) cells
were injected into the left flank or left gastrocnemius
muscle subcutaneously or intramuscularly as indicated.
Tumor growth was monitored by measuring tumor volume
(length × width2/2, mm3) or tumor plus leg diameter (mm).
YM155 treatment commenced once the tumor volume
reached 50 mm3 or the leg diameter reached 8 mm. YM155
or saline control (mice randomized) was administered
subcutaneously as a 3-day per week continuous infusion
for 2 weeks using the Alzet Osmotic Pump® (Model
1003D).
For the orthotopic xenograft model, Luc-ME-180
(1 × 107) cells were injected into the left gastrocnemius
muscle intramuscularly (donor mice). Once the leg
diameter reached 9-12mm, tumors were excised and
dissected. The tumors were then cut into 2-3 mm3
fragments in α-MEM media and placed on ice. Recipient
mice were anesthetized and their uteruses exposed. A small
incision was made in the cervix and a tumor fragment
was sutured in place using a single 8-0 silk suture. The
peritoneal membrane was closed in two layers using 8-0
silk sutures followed by skin closure using wound clips
[24].

Invasion and Migration Assays
Invasion and migration assays were performed using
the BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers and Control
Inserts (BD Biosciences), respectively. Briefly, cells (1 ×
105 cells/well) were seeded with medium containing low
serum (1%) in the upper chamber. The lower chamber
was filled with medium containing high serum (20%) as a
chemoattractant. Cells were incubated for 48 hrs and then
membranes were stained using Diff-Quick (Siemens).
A light microscope was used to count the number of
migrating and invading cells.

Luciferase microRNA Binding Assay
Wild-type (WT) or mutant (MT) fragments of
the survivin 3’-untranslated region (3’UTR) containing
the predicted miR-218 binding site were amplified by
Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies).
Primer sequences are listed in Table S2. Amplified PCR
products were cloned in the pMIR-REPORT miRNA
expression reporter vector (Life Technologies). Cells
were co-transfected with 20 nM pre-miR, 100 ng pMIRREPORT vector (Firefly luciferase), and 50 ng pRL-SV40
vector (Renilla luciferase, Promega) as a reference control
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). Luciferase
activities were measured using Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay
System (Promega) at 24 hrs post-transfection.

Bioluminescence Imaging
Mice were injected with 150 mg/kg D-Luciferin
intraperitoneally. After 10 min post-injection, mice were
sacrificed and primary tumors were removed. Metastatic
lymph nodes with luciferase expression were imaged
using an IVIS Spectrum (Xenogen, Caliper Life Sciences).
Images were analyzed with Living Image 4.1 Software
(Xenogen, Caliper Life Sciences).

Statistical Analysis

of known and novel small RNAs in human cervical cancer.
Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6031-6043.

All experiments have been performed at least
three independent times, and the data are presented as
the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical
significance between treatment groups was determined
using the Student’s t-test or Χ2 test. Overall survival curves
were plotted according to the Kaplan-Meier method,
with the log-rank test applied for comparison. Statistical
analyses were performed using JMP5 (SAS Institute).
