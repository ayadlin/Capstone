ABSTRACT
Effective drug development to combat metastatic disease in breast
cancer would be aided by the availability of well-characterized preclinical
animal models that (a) metastasize with high efficiency, (b) metastasize in
a reasonable time-frame, (c) have an intact immune system, and (d) capture
some of the heterogeneity of the human disease. To address these issues,
we have assembled a panel of twelve mouse mammary cancer cell lines that
can metastasize efficiently on implantation into syngeneic immunocompetent
hosts. Genomic characterization shows that more than half of the 30 most
commonly mutated genes in human breast cancer are represented within
the panel. Transcriptomically, most of the models fall into the luminal A or
B intrinsic molecular subtypes, despite the predominance of an aggressive,
poorly-differentiated or spindled histopathology in all models. Patterns of
immune cell infiltration, proliferation rates, apoptosis and angiogenesis
differed significantly among models. Inherent within-model variability of the
metastatic phenotype mandates large cohort sizes for intervention studies
but may also capture some relevant non-genetic sources of variability. The
varied molecular and phenotypic characteristics of this expanded panel of
models should aid in model selection for development of antimetastatic
therapies in vivo, and serve as a useful platform for predictive biomarker
identification.

INTRODUCTION

receiving adjuvant chemotherapy who went on to
develop metastases showed no evidence for an impact of
subsequent therapy on patient survival [2]. Thus there is
clearly a major problem with our current approaches to
the development of therapeutics that effectively target the
metastatic process.
The preclinical process for target identification and
drug development in cancer has been justly criticized for
the poor translatability of results into clinically useful

Metastasis is the most lethal aspect of the
carcinogenic process, and the prognosis for patients with
disseminated disease at diagnosis is dismal, with fiveyear survival rates of less than 25% in breast cancer [1].
While significant progress has been made in treatment
of localized disease [1], results of three decades worth
of randomized clinical trials in breast cancer patients

practice [3]. There are many factors that play into this
problem, but one limitation of most preclinical therapeutic
studies is that they have historically focused on effects of
the intervention on the primary tumor. Metastasis burden,
or survival endpoints driven by metastatic disease, are
rarely used in preclinical drug testing. Furthermore,
the information that we have about the biology of the
metastatic process and the response of metastases to
therapy is generalized from a very small number of
widely-used models. In breast cancer, these include the
MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line xenografted
into immunodeficient mice (see eg. [4, 5]), the 4T1 murine
mammary cancer cell line allografted into syngeneic
immunocompetent mouse hosts [6], and the genetically
engineered MMTV-PyVT mouse model of metastatic
breast cancer [7]. While these models have indisputably
generated many useful mechanistic insights, they do not
begin to capture the heterogeneity of human breast cancer.
Metastasis is a highly complex multi-step process
that involves a continual and reciprocal dialog between the
tumor cells and the systemic and local microenvironments
[8]. The steps involved include escape of tumor cells
from the primary tumor site by intravasation, passage
through the circulation to distant organs, extravasation
and successful colonization of the distant site. Every step
poses multiple challenges to the survival of the tumor cell,
which has to face and evade threats that include loss of
attachment-based survival signals, physical damage, active
immune surveillance and consequences of interacting with
inhospitable microenvironments to which it is not adapted.
Thus in an ideal world, therapeutic intervention studies
for metastasis would be performed in autochthonous
models, such as the genetically engineered mouse (GEM)
models, where the tumor and host components can coevolve as they would for the human disease. However,
there are very few existing GEM models of breast cancer
that metastasize with a reasonable efficiency. The most
widely-used metastatic GEM model of breast cancer is
the MMTV-PyVT model, in which female mice show an
~90% incidence of lung metastases by 100 days of age
[7]. The MMTV-Neu model is also metastatic, but with a
lower incidence (~50%) and with a longer time-frame to
development of clinically significant metastatic disease (
> 1 year) [9]. Metastasis from other intact GEM models is
even less efficient, making GEM models more useful for
natural history studies of the metastatic process than for
therapeutic intervention studies.
For the purposes of cost-effective drug screening
in vivo, metastatic models with a high efficiency of
metastasis and a shorter time-frame are needed. Currently
these requirements can only be met using transplantation
models. Ideally such models should capture at least some
of the heterogeneity of human breast cancer. Additionally,
it is increasingly appreciated that the full efficacy of
conventional and targeted therapeutic approaches
frequently depends in part on activation of anti-tumor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

immune responses [10]. Thus models with an intact
immune system are desirable for development of most
therapeutic strategies, not just immunotherapy. To address
some of these issues in breast cancer, we have assembled
a panel of 12 metastatic mouse mammary tumor cell line
models for use in syngeneic, fully immunocompetent
hosts. Here we describe the clinico-pathologic, genomic
and transcriptomic characterization of these models.
We explore their relationship to human breast cancer
and address their advantages and challenges for the
development of anti-metastasis therapies.

RESULTS
Origins and metastatic properties of the model
panel
To assemble the panel, we searched the literature
for reports of mouse mammary tumor cell lines with
demonstrated metastatic ability, and we then obtained the
lines directly from the originating laboratory/investigator
so as to avoid problems with inter-laboratory subline
drift. The origins of the 12 cell lines that comprised the
metastatic mouse mammary tumor model panel are
summarized in Table 1. Half the models were derived
from spontaneously arising mammary tumors, and half
were derived from genetically engineered mouse models
(GEMM). Four different mouse strain backgrounds are
represented in the panel. In these studies, we focused on
lung as the predominant metastatic site, since metastases
to other sites were only rarely seen following orthotopic
implantation. The conditions in our laboratory that
were used to generate metastases from each model,
and the efficiency of lung metastasis in that format are
summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Where possible,
models were used in an orthotopic implantation format
with surgical resection of the primary tumor at 7-10mm
in diameter. However, we were unable to get all models
to metastasize efficiently with this approach, in which
case primary tumors were either left unresected, or the
tumor cells were delivered by tail-vein injection, as
indicated in the table. Some models that were described
in the original publication as metastasizing from the
orthotopic site did not do so efficiently in our hands (Eg.
TSAE1). Contributing factors are likely to include mouse
substrain drift leading to minor histocompatibility antigen
mismatches, and inter-institutional variation in factors
such as mouse diet, housing conditions, and microbiota.
In general we find the metastatic phenotype to be much
more sensitive to environmental and immunologic factors
than the primary tumor phenotype, and our experience is
that the same model can exhibit very different metastatic
efficiencies in different facilities, despite using host mice
from the same supplier and cells prepared under identical

resection model in which the primary tumor is resected
when it reaches 7-10mm diameter, while the MVT1
model is a no-resection model with the primary tumor
left in until the study endpoint in order to get a high
metastatic burden (Figure 1A). In general, the primary
tumor weights at resection (4T1) or at endpoint (MVT1)
show relatively low variation within a cohort, with a %
coefficient of variation (% CV) ranging from ~10-20%
(Figure 1B). Results of two independent experiments
are shown for each model. In contrast, the metastatic
burden is an intrinsically very variable phenotype even
under highly controlled conditions, with % CV ranging
from ~40-65% (Figure 1C). Similar variability is seen in
both resection and non-resection models suggesting that
the resection surgery itself is not introducing additional
variability. Furthermore, the variability is not decreased
by normalizing the metastasis burden to the size of the
matched primary tumor (Figure 1D), suggesting that
variations in primary tumor size do not contribute in a
major way to the within-cohort variation in metastatic
burden. Representative low power (Figure 1E) and high
power (Figure 1F) images of lung metastases from the
MVT1 model are shown. The high intrinsic variability
of the metastatic phenotype has practical consequences
for the design of intervention experiments. A power
calculation using the variance that we see in the 4T1
and MVT1 models shows that an absolute minimum of
12 mice/group must be used for a two group comparison
in order to detect a 2-fold reduction of metastatic burden
with a p-value < 0.05 and power of 80%. We typically
use 15 mice/group. An example is shown for the effect
of cytoxan treatment on metastatic burden in the MVT1
model (Figure 1G). Thus study cohorts for metastasis
intervention studies must be considerably larger than
is commonly used when primary tumor volume is the
endpoint.

fibroblast-derived (Figure 2F, Supplementary Figure 1).
Many of the primary tumors showed extensive areas of
necrosis, including most strikingly the E0771 model which
was highly necrotic even at small tumor size.

Immunohistologic characterization of primary
tumors
The hormone receptor status of the models was
determined by immunostaining the primary tumors for
estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR).
Cytokeratin 8 staining on adjacent sections allowed
tumor cells to be distinguished from mouse stromal cells,
since mouse stromal cells show some ER positivity [11].
Four tumor models were found to be weakly ER positive
(EMT6, F3II, TSAE1 and HRM1), with Allred scores of
3-4 (shown for TSAE1 model in Figure 2G). None of the
models was positive for PR (Figure 2H). The E0771 model
has been referred to as ER+ [12], but it was derived and
characterized in the 1950s before reliable ER assays were
available, and it did not show ER positivity in our hands or
those of our collaborators. Of the four ER+ tumor models,
only TSAE1 was clearly growth-stimulated by estradiol in
vitro (Supplementary Figure 3).
To address other biological properties of the models,
immunohistochemical assessment of proliferation,
apoptosis, angiogenesis and immune cell infiltration
was also performed on the primary tumors (Figure 2IR). Tumor cell proliferation varied over a ~ 5x range
between models (Figure 2S; models grouped by origin
from spontaneous vs GEMM tumors). Apoptosis and
angiogenesis were more variable among models (Figure
2T,U). Note that MVT1 scores as having very low
angiogenesis despite the presence of the VEGF transgene,
because blood vessels in MVT1 tumors were collapsed
with no apparent lumens (Supplementary Figure 4A).
Dropping the outlier MVT1 model, a significant negative
correlation between angiogenesis and apoptosis was
seen (Supplementary Figure 4B). None of the other
parameters were significantly correlated. The models
showed variable degrees of leukocytic infiltration,
with leukocytes approaching 50% of the cells in the
tumor for the EMT6 model (Figure 2V). There was also
heterogeneity between models in the relative proportions
of granulocytes (Gr1+) and T-cells (CD3+) within the
tumors. In general, the spontaneous models showed a
higher proportion of granulocytes in the tumor infiltrates,
while the GEMM-derived models typically showed
more T-cells (Supplementary Figure 4C). Using the panleukocyte marker CD45, distinct patterns of leukocyte
distribution within and around the tumor were seen
between models (Figure 2O-R). HRM1, R3T, M6 and
TSAE1 showed a relatively weak immune response
overall; MET1 and F3II showed a strong immune response
primarily around the tumor periphery with little infiltration
into the tumor; 4T1, D2A1, MVT1 and 6DT1 showed

Histopathology of primary tumors and lung
metastases
The histology of the primary tumors generated by
the cell line models was assessed by a panel of veterinary
pathologists and a human anatomic breast cancer
pathologist to arrive at a consensus diagnosis. Tumors
were described as carcinomas with either a spindle cell/
sarcomatoid or a poorly differentiated histopathology
(Figure 2A-C; Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary
Table 2). Despite the poorly differentiated and/or spindled
morphology and the staining of some tumor cells for
α-smooth muscle actin (Figure 2D), tumor cells from
all but one of the models were immunohistochemically
positive for cytokeratin 8 (CK8), confirming that they
are epithelial in origin and not mouse fibroblast-derived
(Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure 2). The E0771
model was essentially negative for CK8, but the cuboidal
morphology of the tumor cells suggests they are not

strong infiltration of immune cells into the tumor; and
E0771 and EMT6 showed massive infiltration particularly
at sites of necrosis. While it is possible that these
patterns of leukocyte distribution may correspond to the
immunologically “ignorant”, “excluded” and “inflamed”
classes that have been described for human tumors
[13], more extensive immunophenotyping of leukocyte
populations and activation state in the mouse tumors will
be necessary to make these comparisons compelling. In
general, individual tumors from the same cell line showed
consistent patterns of immune cell infiltration, though the
M6 model showed some heterogeneity, with occasional
tumors showing a strong inflammatory response.

[17]. Indeed, analysis of the mutational pattern of the
nsSNVs shows that R3T has a very high frequency of A
> T transversions (Supplementary Figure 5B), which is
characteristic of DMBA-induced mutations [18, 19]. Aside
from these two outlier models, among the other models,
C > G transversions and C > T transitions were the most
frequent events (Supplementary Figure 5C), and these
are also the highest frequency alterations in human breast
cancers [20], suggesting that similar mutational processes
may be involved in the mouse models and in the human
disease. The SNV burden/genome was significantly
higher ( > 2-fold) for the models that were derived from
spontaneously arising tumors than for models from
genetically engineered mice (Figure 3B). This greater
genetic complexity in the spontaneous models may reflect
the absence of a strong driver oncogene and the longer
time to development for the original tumors.
Mutation frequencies across the genome have been
assessed for human breast cancer [21]. Taking the top 30
genes that are most frequently mutated in breast cancer,
we assessed the occurrence of SNVs in these genes in
the mouse model panel (Table 2). Details of specific
mutations are given in Supplementary Table 4. 16 of the
human top 30 genes have SNVs in one or more of the
mouse models. Pik3ca mutations, which are very frequent
in human breast cancer, are found spontaneously in two
of the models (6DT1 and MVT1), and as a transgene in
one model (HRM1). The incidence of Tp53 mutations in
the mouse panel (42%) is similar to that in human breast
cancer (32%), though it should be noted that the enormous
difference in size of the human and mouse datasets
precludes any firm conclusions being drawn about relative
mutation frequencies in the two species. The 4T1 model
has previously been described to be p53 null [22], despite
being genetically wildtype in our analysis. However,
by Western blot, we find that the 4T1 model may be
phenotypically null as the p53 protein is not detectable
in vitro following treatment with a DNA-damaging agent

Genomic characterization: single nucleotide
variants
To assess the presence of mutations in the various
tumor models, exome sequencing of gDNA from the
cell lines was performed. After filtering out polymorphic
variants, the majority (10/12) of the cell lines had between
50 and 800 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in coding
genes (Figure 3A). The mean ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous SNVs was 2.48 +/- 0.51 (range 1.42-3.19)
when averaged across all models (see Supplementary
Table 3), which is close to the ratio of ~2:1 that is seen
in many human cancers [14, 15]. E0771 (C57BL/6
background) and R3T (129S3 background) were outliers
with over 2000 total SNVs each. For E0771, this may
reflect the long period of time since the parent tumor was
originally derived in 1940 [16], with a high likelihood of
spontaneous mutation and substrain drift in the intervening
decades. The most frequent mutation in E0771 is A > C
(Supplementary Figure 5A), which has previously been
associated with oxidative stress [14]. For R3T , the high
mutation burden likely relates to the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]
anthrathracene (DMBA) mutagenesis of the parent mouse

Mutations were identified by exome gDNA sequencing of cell lines. Gene mutation status is given by 0 (wildtype), 1
(heterozygous) and 2 (homozygous). Details of individual mutations are given in Supplementary Table 4. The top 30 most
frequently mutated genes in human breast cancer were taken from Lawrence et al [21]. Genes in the top 30 with no mutations
in the panel were Gata3, Map3k1, Mll3, Cdh1, Runx1, Pik3r1, Ctcf, Cbfp, Tbx3, Foxa1, Rb1, Mll, Stag2, Myb, Hist1h3b,
Cdkn1b, Rab40a. *Activating mutation is in the human transgene. †p53 is genetically wildtype but protein is undetectable.
**p53 is functionally inactivated in this model by the SV40 T transgene.
(Supplementary Fig 6). The most frequently mutated
gene in the mouse panel is K-Ras which is present in
5/12 models, including both spontaneous and GEMMderived lines. This mutation is relatively rare in human
breast cancer ( < 2% of cases in most studies). However,
activation of the ras/MAPK pathway is seen frequently,
particularly in triple negative breast cancer [23], and
KRASG12D was recently shown to induce tumorigenesis of
normal human breast epithelial cells with high efficiency

of the MMTV-Myc transgene in these models. D2A1,
E0771, HRM1 and TSAE1 all had larger amplicons that
included the entire Myc locus, and extended to include
the adjacent Pvt1 locus (Figure 4A). Approximately
10% of all human breast cancers show co-amplification
of MYC and PVT1, with a particularly high proportion
(62%) among HER2+ tumors [25]. Pvt1 encodes a long
non-coding RNA that stabilizes Myc protein expression,
and low copy number gains in Myc and Pvt1 cooperate
to promote breast cancer development in mouse models
[25]. Cdkn2b was homozygously deleted in 4T1 and
E0771, while in 6DT1 and MVT1, the region of deletion
extended to include Cdkn2a as well as Cdkn2b Figure 4B).
Deletions in these cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are
found in ~4% of human breast cancers [26]. Few other
recurrent amplifications or deletions were seen across the
panel. The HER2/ERBB2/Neu locus, which is a frequent
site of amplification in human breast cancers, was not
amplified in any models. However the Erbb4 locus
on chromosome 1qC3 showed recurrent internal focal
deletions encompassing exons 2 and/or 3 in four of the
models (6DT1, D2A1, HRM1 and MVT1) (Figure 4C).
ERBB4/HER4 is the receptor for the Neuregulin family
of ligands, with conflicting reported roles in breast cancer
that may depend on the splice variant considered [27] [28].

Genomic characterization: copy number variants
Copy number variation (CNV) across the mouse
genome was assessed using the Affymetrix® Mouse
Diversity Genotyping array. The genome-wide burden
of losses and gains varied widely across the model panel
(Figure 3C), with a trend to a higher CNV fraction in
the spontaneous models (Figure 3D). HRM1 and D2A1
showed a relatively high copy number loss fraction and
frequency, while M6 had a high frequency of small copy
number gains (Figure 3C,E). Among the genes commonly
amplified or deleted in human breast cancer, only
amplifications in Myc and Mdm2 and deletions of Cdkna,
Cdkn4b, Csmd1 and Ptprd were seen in the mouse tumor
panel (Supplementary Table 5). 6DT1 and MVT1 showed
focal amplifications of Myc, reflecting the presence

for individual models). The 6DT1 model split between
Clusters 1 and 3, but all four tumors had a high EMT score
so the model is probably claudin-low.
In cluster 2 tumors (F311, TSAE1, 4T1, R3T,
HRM1), β-estradiol was predicted to be the most highly
activated upstream regulator (Figure 5F), consistent with
enrichment of models that were immunohistochemically
ER-positive (Figure 5G). Proinflammatory cytokines
such as TNF and IL1B were also predicted to be
activated. Thus, although cluster 2 tumors have lower
total leukocyte numbers than cluster 3 tumors as
assessed by immunohistochemistry (Supplementary
Figure 7C)), the leukocytes in cluster 2 tumors may be
more highly activated, or these cytokine pathways may
be activated in the tumor cells themselves. It will be
important in the future to do comprehensive FACS-based
immunophenotyping to get a more detailed assessment of
functional leukocyte subtypes and their activation status.
As expected ZEB1, a key regulator of EMT, was less
active in cluster 2 than cluster 3 (claudin-low) tumors.
Analysis for enriched biofunctions suggested that cluster 2
tumors would be more invasive and proliferative than the
cluster 3 claudin-low tumors, as well as more differentiated
and more angiogenic (Figure 5F). Significantly higher
angiogenesis in cluster 2 tumors was confirmed by
immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Figure 7D). The
lower proliferation signal in cluster 3 tumors was not seen
at the immunohistochemical level (Supplementary Figure
7E), but is consistent with data suggesting that the claudinlow human breast cancers lack a strong proliferation
signature [30]. The lower invasion/migration signal in
the claudin-low cluster 3 tumors is unexpected and needs
further investigation. Key transcriptomic features of the
three clusters are summarized in Figure 5H.

Transcriptomic architecture of mouse model
panel
To probe more of the tumor biology captured in the
model panel, the transcriptomes of four orthotopicallyimplanted primary tumors from each of the 12 models
were analyzed using the Affymetrix® Mouse Gene 1.0ST
array. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that
the mouse models fell into three main transcriptomic
clusters (Figure 5A). Models from different mouse strains
were distributed between the three clusters, indicating
that genetic background was not the major driver of the
transcriptomic differences. Cluster 1 (primarily M6 and
MET1) was characterized most notably by low expression
of chemokines and immune modulators (eg. CCL2,
CCL13, CCL7, CXCL3, CXCL10, CXCL16, CSF1,
IL1, IL18, IL24) and indications of low cytotoxic T-cell
function (low granzyme B). IPA® upstream regulator
analysis of differentially expressed genes predicts that the
immunosuppressive cytokine IL10 is active in the Cluster
1 tumors, while activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines
is suppressed (Figure 5B). IPA® biofunction analysis
further predicts that Cluster 1 tumors are relatively
immunologically silent, with decreased inflammation,
immune cell recruitment and activation in these models
(Figure 5B). Similarly, a core interferon-γ gene signature
that is associated with response to immune checkpoint
inhibitors has much lower score in this cluster (Figure
5C; Supplementary Figure 7A for individual models).
As noted earlier, immunostaining for the pan-leukocyte
marker CD45 showed little leukocyte infiltration into the
M6 tumors, and leukocytes predominantly localized round
the tumor margins for MET1 tumors.
Cluster 3 tumors (D2A1, EMT6, MVT1,
E0771, 6DT1) were strikingly characterized by very
low expression of claudin genes. Indeed, models in
cluster 3 could largely be segregated based just on the
expression of E-cadherin and three claudins (Figure
5D). A “claudin-low” subtype of human breast cancers
was originally identified in gene expression analysis of
combined mouse and human mammary tumor datasets,
and was subsequently shown to capture a poor prognosis,
metaplastic cancer subtype with features of mammary
stem cells [30]. The tumor models in cluster 3 were also
predicted to be claudin-low using a published human
1390-gene claudin-low predictor [31] (data not shown).
Consistent with their claudin-low status, the Cluster 3
tumors had a high score for a consensus gene signature
that defines cancer-associated epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) (Figure 5E; Supplementary Fig 7B

Optimization of subtype assignment strategies for
mouse models
Transcriptomes of human breast cancer have
been classified into 5 intrinsic subtypes with prognostic
significance [32]. To determine which mouse allograft
models map to which intrinsic human subtypes, seven
different computational methods were evaluated using
four different gene lists as detailed in Methods, to identify
the optimal combination for subtype calling across
species. The results of the analysis indicated that the
clustering method was the most robust at subtype calling,
as measured by Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis
(Supplementary Table 6), followed by the Principle
Component Analysis (PCA) method. All four of the
method/gene list combinations that involved clustering
as the computational method gave high AUC scores, with
the clustering method/G1841 genelist combination being
best overall. When applied to the mouse models, the seven
computational methods were similar in their classification

of the majority (11/12) of models as non-basal, but there
were differences in their assignment of models to the
luminal B and HER2-enriched classes (see Supplementary
Table 7 for results with the G1841 list). In relation to
optimal genelists for the analysis, the distribution and
robustness of subtype calls for the mouse (G1841) and
human (G1918) intrinsic gene lists were highly similar
(Supplementary Table 8) demonstrating that the mouse
and human gene lists were approximately equal in their
ability to discriminate human breast cancer subtypes.

in a previous study ([33]. Human basal breast cancers
are characterized by a proliferation gene cluster and
a more aggressive biology [30]. We did not see a clear
correlation between intrinsic subtype in the mouse models
and biological parameters that might associate with more
aggressive disease (Figure 6C). If anything, there was a
trend toward increased apoptosis and reduced immune cell
infiltration and reduced microvessel density in the luminal
B and basal mouse tumors compared with the luminal A
tumors. However, it should be emphasized that this is a
small dataset and that the mouse models were pre-selected
for clinically aggressive metastatic disease.

Intrinsic subtype assignment of mouse allograft
models

Relatedness to human patient derived xenografts

Using the clustering method with the G1841
mouse intrinsic genelist, the majority of the mouse
allograft models were assigned to the Luminal A class
(Figure 6A). Exceptions were E0771 and D2A1 which
were predominantly luminal B. Only the M6 model,
derived from the C3(1)TAg transgenic mouse, was
transcriptomically basal. Using the much smaller PAM50
genelist with the Cluster method, again only M6 was
classified as basal, though some of the other models
showed a higher luminal B component with this genelist,
and HRM1 was classified as predominantly HER2
enriched (Supplementary Figure 8). The assignment of M6
to the basal subclass is consistent with published reports
that tumors from the parental C3(1)TAg transgenic model
are also classified as basal [33, 34].
The assignment of the other models to the luminal
subclasses was more unexpected so we looked at other
properties that are expected to correlate with the luminal
subtype. Despite a uniformly aggressive and poorly
differentiated or spindled histopathology, four of the nine
models assigned to the luminal A subclass were weakly
ER-positive (Figure 6B), consistent with observations
that the majority of ER+ human breast cancers fall into
luminal A intrinsic subtype [30]. Similarly, three of the
nine luminal A mouse models had Pik3ca mutations,
which are also enriched in human luminal A tumors
[35]. An MMTV-Pik3ca-H1047R transgenic model was
previously described to be ER+ [36] and with a luminal
expression profile [33]. TP53 mutations are found at
very high frequency (80%) in human basal breast cancer,
but they are also seen in a significant fraction of human
luminal A (12%) and luminal B (29%) tumors, so the
presence of Tp53 mutations in 5 of the 11 models that
were classified as either luminal A or B is at higher
incidence than seen in the human counterparts, but not
entirely implausible. MVT1 and 6DT1 were both derived
from transgenic models that included the MMTV-Myc
transgene and these models were subtyped as luminal,
but could not be unambiguously assigned to luminal A vs
luminal B. The parental MMTV-Myc transgenic model
was linked with both basal-like and luminal B subtypes

Human patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are
increasingly being explored as useful avatars of human
disease [37]. We assessed the transcriptomic relatedness
of the immunocompetent mouse allograft models to
a published panel of 25 human breast cancer PDXs
[38]. After normalization and batch effect removal,
unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the merged datasets
showed that mouse model cluster 1 (predominantly M6
and MET1) clustered in the same arm of the dendrogram
as the human PDXs while mouse cluster 2 and cluster 3
were distinct (Figure 7). The mouse cluster 1 allografts
were more closely related to the human basal PDXs than
the human HER2 PDXs, which occupied a separate arm
on the dendrogram. No luminal PDXs were represented
in this dataset. The biological basis of the transcriptomic
relatedness of the mouse cluster 1 models to the human
PDXs needs to be further explored, but could in part
reflect the observation that the cluster 1 models mouse are
predicted to be relatively immunologically silent, and the
human PDXs were implanted in immunodeficient mouse
hosts.

DISCUSSION
Human breast cancer is a heterogenous disease [39].
Considerable variation in clinical course, histopathology,
genetic characteristics and transcriptomic profiles is seen
between patients, and disease within a given patient can
also show locoregional and chronological variation.
Metastasis is the lethal end-stage of cancer progression,
and few if any effective treatments exist for established
metastatic disease [1]. One reason for this failure is the
paucity of preclinical drug development studies that use
metastatic burden as an endpoint. Another is the reliance
on a very small number of metastatic models that may
lack predictive power because they capture too little
of the heterogeneity of the human disease. To address
these issues, we have characterized a panel of 12 cell
line-based mouse allograft models of metastatic breast
cancer. Conditions were established in which the models

metastasize to the lungs with a frequency at least 50%, and
in most cases metastasis incidence rates of 80-100% were
achieved. Further optimization is still possible, and the use
of alternative delivery routes (eg. intracardiac injection)
could expand the range of metastatic sites to include bone,
brain and viscera.

amplification and CDKN2A/B deletions were also seen in
a recently established bank of human breast cancer PDXs
[40], these genetic events may contribute to efficient
engraftment. In addition to the range of somatic tumor
mutations found in the panel, the use of models from four
different mouse strains also contributes some of germline
genetic variation seen in humans. Histologically the
models all formed poorly differentiated or sarcomatoid/
spindled tumors at the primary site, which are not common
histologies in human breast cancer. However, there was
cross-panel heterogeneity in many other clinically relevant
biological properties, including proliferative index,
angiogenesis, and patterns of leucocyte infiltration into
the primary tumors. The transcriptomic data suggested that
the models may fall into immunologically active (cluster 2
models) and immunologically suppressed (clusters 1 and
3 models). It will be of interest to see if these correspond
to the “T-cell inflamed” vs “non-T-cell inflamed”

Heterogeneity captured by the model panel
The allograft panel captures at least some of the
heterogeneity seen in human breast cancer. At a genetic
level, over half of the 30 most frequent mutation events
in human breast cancer and several of the most frequent
copy number variation events are represented in the panel.
Kras mutations, Myc amplification and Cdkn2a/b deletions
are somewhat over-represented when compared with their
incidence in human breast cancer. Since frequent MYC

component is largely missing in mouse tumors [34].
Thus the “triple negative” designation in mouse may not
encompass the same biology as it does in human.
Finally, using an orthogonal transcriptomic
classifier, five of the luminal models were found to also
be “claudin-low” (EMT6, MVT1, 6DT1, E0771, D2A1).
The claudin-low signature is associated with a relatively
rare metaplastic subtype of human breast cancer, and
has hallmarks of a stem-like, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition state [30]. This signature is enriched in
human breast cancers following endocrine therapy or
chemotherapy [45], so the claudin-low tumors may be
useful as models of recurrent disease. The claudin-low
phenotype is also over-represented in human breast
cancer cell lines [46], suggesting it may confer a selective
advantage in tissue culture.

human tumor classes that correlate with response to
immunotherapy [41]. This immunologic heterogeneity
may be useful in the development of immune-based
therapies for metastasis.

Classification of the models in relation to human
disease subtypes
Multiple different strategies for sub-classifying
human breast cancer are currently in use. All emphasize
different types of information, which may or may not be
directly interrelated. The simplest molecular classification
used to guide therapy involves three markers, namely
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR),
and HER2 amplification status. Using that classification
scheme, the majority (8/12) of the mouse models in the
panel are “triple negative” for all three markers. Four
of the models (EMT6, F311, TSAE1 and HRM1) were
weakly ER-positive by immunohistochemistry and all
of these except EMT6 fell into a transcriptomic cluster
(Cluster 2) that had predicted activation of estrogen as an
upstream regulator. Since the mouse GEMM models of
breast cancer are generally ER-negative [34], the presence
of ER-positive models in the allograft panel is a potential
strength. However, currently it is not known whether the
allograft models are hormone-dependent for tumor growth
or metastasis.
More recently, human breast cancers have been
classified into different molecular subtypes on the basis
of transcriptomic characteristics [42], with or without
additional genomic information [43]. The most widelyused transcriptomic classification identifies 5 distinct
“intrinsic” subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-like,
normal-like and basal). Applying this classification scheme
to the mouse model panel, the majority of the models
were found to be luminal A or luminal B. Only a single
model (M6) classified as basal, which was consistent with
the basal classification of the parental C3(1)Tag GEM
model from which the M6 cell line was derived [34].
The transcriptomic classification of most of the allograft
models as luminal A or B was unexpected, given their
aggressive histopathology and clinical behavior, and the
low or absent hormone receptor expression. However,
this class assignment was robustly seen with a variety
of different classifier genesets and algorithms, and was
consistent with the ER-positivity of four of the models,
and the presence of Pik3ca mutations in another two.
There are human/mouse differences in hormone receptor
expression in the normal mammary gland, including much
lower ERa expression in mouse luminal progenitors [44].
This may lead to mouse tumors that are transcriptomically
luminal, but nevertheless are “triple negative” by marker
analysis. Indeed, it has been suggested that the human
“luminal” transcriptome has two components, one driven
by ER and the other by GATA3, and that the ER-driven
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Relationship of mouse models to PDXs
Patient-derived tumor xenografts are an emerging
tool for drug development or selection studies. They
largely recapitulate the histological and transcriptomic
characteristics of the original tumor [40], and to the extent
that it has been tested, the response of the PDX to drugs
correlates well with clinical outcome when the patient
is treated with a drug selected through a PDX screen
[47]. Thus there is hope that PDXs will enable precision
medicine approaches to cancer therapy. Realistically, the
routine generation of PDXs from every individual patient
is likely to be cost- and time-prohibitive for guiding
therapy selection in real time. It will be more feasible
to map the tumor from any given patient onto a closelyrelated avatar from an established panel of representative
PDXs for which the response to different therapeutic
agents/strategies has already been assessed [37]. However,
one key limitation of these PDXs currently is the lack of
an immune component. Here we addressed whether it
would be possible to find mouse avatars of the human
avatars by comparing the transcriptomes of the mouse
panel tumors with a panel of human breast cancer PDXs.
Interestingly our Cluster 1 mouse models (MET1, M6 and
some 6DT1) cluster in with the human PDXs, suggesting
that with an expanded panel of mouse allograft models,
this approach might be feasible.

How to use the models
All models have strengths and limitations that need
to be recognized so that they can be used optimally. The
advantages of the mouse allograft models include that
they are fully immunocompetent, there is no species
incompatibility in paracrine interactions between tumor
and stroma, the disease course is rapid, and metastasis
burden can realistically be used as an endpoint in
therapeutic intervention studies. On the negative side, the

histology of the primary mouse allograft tumors is unlike
that of most human breast cancers, the rapid time course
may skew the biology, and the use of established cell lines
may introduce bias due to selection of properties that allow
propagation on plastic. However, we would argue that for
the development of anti-metastatic therapies, the robust
metastatic phenotype and the presence of an intact immune
system trumps the other limitations of these models for
now. In the future, further advances may come from the
use of never-on-plastic mouse allograft models [48, 49]
or metastatic PDXs in mice with reconstituted human
immune systems [37]. It should also be fully appreciated
that there will be no simple one-to-one mapping of any
mouse model onto human cancer subtypes with respect
to every characteristic. The mapping is multidimensional,
with different results in different dimensions (genetic,
transcriptomic, histopathology, clinical behavior etc).
Model selection should be driven by which aspect of the
biology is most important for the question being asked.
In summary, we have extensively characterized
a panel of metastatic mouse allograft models of breast
cancer that captures some of the heterogeneity of the
human disease. This panel should serve as a useful
platform for anti-metastatic drug screening and predictive
biomarker development.

supplemented with 10ng/ml EGF and 10μg/ml insulin,
and were treated with 17-β-estradiol (Sigma E2758) at
a final concentration of 100nM, or vehicle control. Cell
proliferation over 42h was assessed by measuring culture
confluence using an IncuCyte ZOOM® Live Cell Analysis
System (Essen Biosciences).

Animal studies and tissue collection
Pilot experiments using different cell innocula,
different experimental formats and different time-frames
were run to optimize the metastatic efficiency for each
model. Ideally we wished to find conditions that gave lung
metastases in at least 40% of the mice on study following
orthotopic implantation of the primary tumors, with
surgical resection when tumors reached 5-8mm diameter,
and metastatic burden being detectable within 60 days
of tumor cell implantation. The detailed experimental
conditions used to generate metastases from all these
models in our facility are given in Supplementary Table 1.
However, note that there is room for further optimization
and that results are likely to be facility-dependent. The #4
mammary fat pad (mfp) was the preferred site for tumor
cell implantation because primary tumor resection with
clean margins is easier at this site and tumors can grow to
a larger size without impairing animal mobility. The fatpad
was surgically exposed to ensure that cells were actually
implanted into the mfp rather than in the vicinity of it. If
metastatic efficiency was too low from the #4 mfp, the #2
mfp was tried as this generally gives a higher frequency
of metastases, but the surgery is more complex because
of the high vascularity of tumors at this site and there is
then a higher risk of local recurrence and post-operative
complications. For the EMT6 model, cells were implanted
in a 1:1 mix with reduced growth factor Matrigel (BD
Biosciences). If metastatic frequency following tumor
resection was low, the model was run without resection
(E0771, MVT1, R3T). If metastatic frequency was still
undesirably low following orthotopic implantation, cells
were introduced into the mice via the tail vein (F3II,
MET1 and TSAE1). At the experimental endpoint, mice
were euthanized by carbon dioxide narcosis followed
by thoracotomy. Primary tumors were bisected and snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen for molecular analyses, or fixed
in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). Lungs were
inflated with 10% NBF and fixed, and the individual
lung lobes were separated prior to embedding in a single
block. Fixed tissues were paraffin embedded for histology
and metastases were enumerated on an H&E-stained
cross-section of all lung lobes. For the chemotherapy
intervention study, mice were implanted with 200,000
MVT1 cells in the #4 mammary fat pad, and three onceweekly injections of cytoxan (10mg/Kg i.p. in PBS)
were given to each animal starting when tumors became
palpable (3mm diameter). A control cohort received
injections of PBS.

are summarized in Supplementary Table 10. A human
anatomic pathologist (PHW) contributed diagnoses from
a human pathology perspective.
Hormone receptor status. To determine estrogen
receptor and progesterone receptor status, immunostained
sections of three representative primary tumors from
each model were assessed independently by a veterinary
pathologist (MRA) and a surgical pathologist (PHW).
Where results were discrepant, additional tumors were
examined for discrepant models (F311 and HRM1) and
a consensus was reached. ER status was determined in
parallel with adjacent sections stained for cytokeratin 8
(CK8) since mouse mammary stromal cells are estrogen
receptor positive [11] and in many of the models, the
tumor cells had a spindled morphology. Parallel CK
staining, cell morphology and growth patterns allowed
positive tumor cells to be distinguished from positive
stromal cells. The extent of ER positivity in tumors was
scored by the surgical pathologist using the Allred scale
[50], which scores the % of cells stained on a scale of 0
to 5 and the intensity of staining on a scale of 0 to 3, for a
maximum possible total score of 8.
Additional immunohistochemical markers. Three
representative primary tumors for each model were
immunostained for Ki67 (proliferation), Caspase3
(apoptosis), CD34 (angiogenesis), CD45 (pan-leukocyte),
CD3 (T-cell), Ly6G (granulocyte) markers. Details of the
antibodies and conditions used for immunostaining are
given in Supplementary Table 10. All immunostaining
steps from deparaffinization through counterstaining
were performed using a BondMax Autostainer (Leica
Biosystems). Immunostained slides were scanned at
20x magnification using an Aperio Scanner. Images of
the entire tumor section were manually segmented to
exclude regions of intra-tumoral necrosis and of stroma
surrounding the tumor, and automated Aperio-designed
algorithms were run to assess the positive cells as %
total nuclei in the segmented region (Ki67, caspase3
and leukocyte markers) or microvessel density (CD34: #
microvessels/μm2).

Cultured cells were treated with 0.5μM Adriamycin
for 6 hours to induce p53. Western blots of the cell lysates
were run to assess expression of p53 and the canonical p53
target p21. Tubulin was the loading control. Antibodies
used were p53, sc-1312, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; p21,
sc397, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; α-tubulin, T6199,
Sigma-Aldrich.

Genomic characterization of tumor cell lines
Copy number variant (CNV) analysis. RNAfree genomic DNA (gDNA) was prepared from each
cultured cell line using the Gentra Puregene Cell Kit
(Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol and
resuspended in low EDTA TE buffer. DNA was labeled
using the Affymetrix® SNP 6.0 protocol and hybridized
to the Affymetrix® Mouse Diversity Genotyping array,
which interrogates more than 623,000 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and 916,000 non-polymorphic
regions across the genome, allowing mapping to a
resolution of 4.3 kb. Arrays were scanned using the
Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G Plus scanner. Images
and intensity data were collected using the Affymetrix
GeneChip Command Console (AGCC) software, and data
were analyzed using the R package MouseDivGeno [51].
Data from normal tissue of matched mouse strains (http://
cgd.jax.org/datasets/diversityarray/CELfiles.shtml) were
used as references to identify strain-specific regions of
copy number gain or loss, which were then removed from
the processed datasets. CNV data have been deposited in
GEO under accession # GSE69902. CNV fraction was
calculated by adding up genomic regions affect by CNV
loss or gain and dividing by the total genome size. CNV
frequency was calculated by counting the number of
genomic regions affected by CNV loss or gain.
Single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis. gDNA
was prepared as for CNV analysis. Exome libraries were
prepared using the Agilent SureSelect Mouse all-Exon
target enrichment kit. Deep sequencing was performed on
a HiSeq 2000 with TruSeq V3 chemistry, multiplexing of
3 samples/lane. Mean target coverage depth was 85-141X
with 84% of regions having > 30x coverage. Samtools
mpileup was used to call sequence variants for the 12 cell
lines with mm10 as the reference genome. Mouse strainspecific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
filtered out using dbSNP137 and the Sanger database for
variants identified from whole genome sequencing of 17
mouse strains (ftp://ftpmouse.sanger.ac.uk/current_snps/
mgp.v3.snps.rsIDdbSNPv137.vcf.gz). Variants after
removing dbSNP137 and mgpSNPs were annotated with
ANNOVAR (http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/
latest) [52]. Exonic SNPs were identified and variants
were classified as synonymous or non-synonymous by
30638

ANNOVAR. Variants that were present in all cell lines
from the same strain background, and variants with a
Phred-scaled quality score of < 30 were removed. The
exome fastq data have been deposited in NCBI SRA

each sample was defined as the weighted sum of the
expression of the core 130 genes, with weights 1 and -1
for up and down indicating the direction of expression
change. The IFNγ score for each sample was defined
as the sum of the expression of all the genes on the list.
Mouse tumor transcriptomes were then compared with
the transcriptomes from a published set of human breast
cancer patient-derived xenografts [38]. Among the 21201
mouse genes, 15807 have human homologs. The mouse
tumor and human PDX gene expression datasets were
merged and 13515 genes were found to be shared between
the expression datasets. After removing batch effects,
the mouse tumor samples and the PDX samples were
clustered using the unsupervised hierarchical clustering
method. All mouse tumor array data have been deposited
in GEO under accession number GSE69006. A searchable
Excel spreadsheet containing processed gene expression
information data across the panel is also available for
download from ftp://helix.nih.gov/collab/leemax/public/
Lalage_Wakefield/paper/transcript/.

Gene expression analysis
Primary tumors from cells implanted orthotopically
into the #4 mammary fatpad of syngeneic mouse hosts
were harvested when they reached 0.5-1.0 cm diameter.
RNA was prepared from four representative tumors of
each of the 12 models using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN).
RNA quality was checked using an Agilent Bioanalyzer
and all but two samples (both from 6DT1 model with
RIN~7) had a RIN > 8. RNA samples were processed and
hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array
using standard manufacturer-recommended protocols, and
scanned on the Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 Scanner. Raw
data were collected using Affymetrix AGCC software.
The 48 CEL files were normalized by the RMA method
using Affymetrix Expression Console. The probes without
gene names were removed and expression values of the
multiple probes for the same gene were combined into
one by averaging. The unsupervised hierarchical cluster
method was applied to divide the 48 tumor samples into
three clusters. To derive differentially expressed genes,
transcriptomes of tumor samples in one group were
compared to those in another group, where each group
is one of the clusters or the union of two clusters. The
differentially expressed genes from each test (absolute
fold-change cutoff > 1.5; p < 0.001) were analyzed for
pathway enrichment and upstream regulator identification
using Ingenuity ® Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN). Upstream
regulator analysis in this program is based on prior
knowledge of expected effects between transcriptional
regulators and their target genes stored in the Ingenuity®
Knowledge Base and examines how many known targets
of a given transcriptional regulator are present in the
dataset as well as comparing the direction of change with
that expected from the literature. (http://pages.ingenuity.
com/rs/ingenuity/images/0812%20upstream_regulator_
analysis_whitepaper.pdf) In an independent analysis, the
scores for an EMT signature and an interferon-γ (IFNγ)
activation signature were also assessed across the panel.
The EMT signature used was a 130 consensus genelist
(Supplementary Table 11) derived from a meta-analysis
of gene expression signatures defining EMT during
cancer progression [53]. The IFNγ signature geneset
(Supplementary Table 12) came from a core list of
IFNγ-related genes associated with response to immune
checkpoint inhibitor therapy (https://www.google.com/
patents/WO2015094992A1?cl=en). The EMT score for

Intrinsic subtype analysis
To determine which mouse allograft models map
to which intrinsic human subtypes, seven different
computational methods were evaluated in combination
with four different gene lists to identify the optimal
combination for subtype calling across species. The
computational methods evaluated were as follows:
Genefu, Clustering, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Principal component analysis
(PCA), General linear models (GLM) and Random forest
(RF). The gene lists were the commonly used PAM50
subtyping signature [54], an expanded human “intrinsic”
gene list of 1918 genes [54], a mouse-derived intrinsic
geneset of 1841 genes [33], and an extended PAM50 gene
list (PAM50+) that included the PAM50 geneset plus the
450 genes that overlapped between the mouse and human
intrinsic gene lists. To evaluate performance, each of
the 28 combinations were trained on the TCGA breast
cancer gene expression data and clinical characteristics.
Subsequently the trained gene list/computational method
combinations were used to call the subtypes of the
GSE2034 breast cancer data set, and the results were
compared to the pre-existing GSE2034 clinical subtype
assignments. The best performing genelist/method
combination was then used to assign the mouse tumors to
the most closely matched human intrinsic subtype.
