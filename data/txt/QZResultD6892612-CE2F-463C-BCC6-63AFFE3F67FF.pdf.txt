ABSTRACT
The programmed death-1 (PD-1), a coinhibitory receptor expressed on activated
T cells and B cells, is demonstrated to induce an immune-mediated response and play
a critical role in tumor initiation and development. The cancer patients harboring PD-1
or PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein expression have often a poor prognosis and clinical
outcome. Currently, targeting PD-1 pathway as a potential new anticancer strategy
is attracting more and more attention in cancer treatment. Several monoclonal
antibodies against PD-1 or PD-L1 have been reported to enhance anticancer
immune responses and induce tumor cell death. Nonetheless, the precise molecular
mechanisms by which PD-1 affects various cancers remain elusive. Moreover, this
therapy is not effective for all the cancer patients and only a fraction of patients
respond to the antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1, indicating these antibodies may
only works in a subset of certain cancers. Thus, understanding the novel function
of PD-1 and genetic determinants of response to anti-PD-1 therapy will allow us to
develop a more effective and individualized immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer.

Based on the concept that cancer cells may employ
several mechanisms to escape immune recognition
and elimination of their host, cancer immunotherapy is
developed [1]. The aim of cancer immunotherapy is to
activate a patient’s own immune system to kill the tumor
cells [2]. Over the past several decades, a large number of
immunotherapeutic approaches to cancer treatment have
been established, including cancer vaccines, adoptive
transfer of ex vivo activated T and natural killer cells,
anticancer monoclonal antibodies and the checkpoint
inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 [3].
PD-1 (also CD279), a coinhibitory receptor
expressed on the surface of activated T cells and B
cells, has been linked to immune tolerance and therefore
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

provides a possible mechanism of escape immune
surveillance when tumor cells become capable of
expressing PD-L1 [4, 5]. PD-1 is mainly activated by
interacting with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 [6, 7]. PDL1 is widely distributed on diverse cell types in lymphoid
and nonlymphoid tissues, whereas PD-L2 is mainly
expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) and some macrophages
[8, 9]. Once activated, PD-1 exerts a negative effect on
immune responses by dephosphorylating key downstream
proteins of the antigen receptor [10, 11]. Thus, the
PD-1 pathway may serve as an important regulator for
the induction and maintenance of peripheral immune
tolerance.

(TILs) was proved to correlate with impaired immune
responses and poor outcome in several tumor types [12,
13]. However, there is a controversial report regarding
the prognostic implication of PD-1 positive (+) TILs in
cancer patients. Kim and colleagues found that increased
numbers of PD-1(+) TILs were significantly associated
with prolonged disease-free survival of pulmonary
squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) patients [14]. So the
role of PD-1(+) TILs in the prognosis of cancer patients
remains unresolved. The expression of PD-L1 has been
shown to be correlated with poor prognosis in patients
with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer,
gastric cancer, soft tissue sarcomas and meningioma
[15-19]. Tumor cells may upregulate PD-L1 expression
as a way to suppress the host immune response and
therefore escape immune destruction. These data provide
a clearer understanding of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway that
limits an antitumor immune response and lead to the
development of several anticancer drugs by blocking the
distinct checkpoints PD-1 or its major ligand PD-L1. As a
potential new anticancer strategy, the checkpoint inhibitors
anti-PD-1 and anti- PD-L1 have attracted an enormous
amount of interest and generated an encouraging clinical
outcome in the treatment of patients with solid tumors,
particularly in NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma and
melanoma [20, 21]. However, not all the cancer patients
can gain the benefit from this treatment. For instance,
anti-PD-1 antibody produced objective responses only

in approximately one in four to one in five patients with
NSCLC, melanoma, or renal cell cancer [22], indicating
that the genetic background of cancer patients might
determine the clinical responses to anti-PD-1 and antiPD-L1 treatments. The answer to this critical issue will
provide us increased understanding of response to antiPD-1 therapy and promote the individualized application
of these agents in the clinic.
In this review we will summarize the antineoplastic
properties of PD-1 pathway as a rheostat of immunological
regulation and discuss the genetic determinants of
manipulating this strategy for cancer therapy.

THE ROLE OF PD-1/PD-L1 PATHWAY IN
CELL IMMUNE RESPONSE
PD-1, a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig)
superfamily, contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
inhibitory motif (ITIM) as well as an immunoreceptor
tyrosine switch motif (ITSM) in its cytoplasmic tail
and delivers inhibitory signals to immune cells upon
the binding of its ligand, PD-L1 or PD-L2 [23]. PD-1
is expressed on peripheral T cells, B cells, natural
killer T (NKT) cells, DCs and some monocytes upon
their activation [24]. The immediate outcome of PD-1
engagement via binding with its ligand is inhibition of cell
growth and cytokine secretion (Figure 1).

Figure 1: The role of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in cell immune response. PD-1 functions to inhibit T cell activation not only by

attenuating TCR signaling (SHP-1/2), but also by enhancing the expression of genes that impair T cell function. PI3K-Akt-mTOR, JNK,
and Ras-MEK-ERK signals are crucial regulators for PD-1-mediated inhibitory effect on T cell immune. PD-L2 is mainly expressed on B
cells. Oct2 can regulate PD-L2 gene expression in B-1 cells and at low antigen concentrations, PD-L2-PD-1interactions suppressed B cell
function by inhibiting TCR-B7-CD28 signals.

PD-1 engagement may directly inhibit T cell antigen
receptor (TCR)-mediated effector functions within tissues
via recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2
[25], which is essential for the maintenance of immune
tolerance. PD-1 negatively regulates innate immune
cells, the failure of which can cause the activation of
autoimmunity [26]. Interactions between PD-1 and PDL1 promoted tolerance by blocking the TCR-induced
stop signal in the pancreatic islets, and blockade of
PD-1 or PD-L1 suppressed T cell motility and abrogated
peripheral tolerance [27]. In vivo, PD-1 deficiency induced
autoimmunity in variety of spontaneous autoimmune
diseases depending on the genetic background of the
mice. The mice genetically lacking PD-1 developed
dilated cardiomyopathy through the exhibition of hightiter circulating IgG autoantibodies to troponin I on the
BALB/c background [28, 29]. PD-1 deficiency specifically
accelerated the onset and frequency of type I diabetes in
nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice [30]. Overexpression of
PD-1 in DCs inhibited allogeneic lymphocyte activation
in BALB/c mice [31]. Those observations suggest that
PD-1 may regulate both innate responses and lymphocyte
responses to prevent autoimmunity.
PD-1 functions to limit T cell activation not only
by attenuating TCR signaling, but also by enhancing the
expression of genes that impair T cell function. PD-1
coordinately upregulated the expression of transcription
factor ATF-like (BATF) which was sufficient to impair T
cell proliferation and cytokine secretion [32]. Silencing
BATF in T cells reduced PD-1 inhibition and rescued
HIV-specific T cell function. PD-1 altered T-cell metabolic
reprogramming by inhibiting glycolysis and promoting
lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, which reveal a metabolic
mechanism responsible for PD-1-mediated blockade
of T-cell effector function [33]. Triggering of PD-1
inhibited T cell expansion and function by upregulating
IL-10 production [34]. Blockade of PD-1 increased the
activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and
its downstream targets AKT and mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), which are impaired in antiviral
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In the further study,
the transcription factor FoxO1 was demonstrated to be
responsible for sustaining the expression and function of
PD-1 in exhausted CTLs [35]. Some other transcription
factors are also involved in regulation of PD-1 expression.
Mutation of Nuclear factor of activated T cells c1
(NFATc1) resulted in a complete loss of PD-1 expression
in T cells [36]. The interferon (IFN)-sensitive responsive
element (ISRE) was shown to be essential for IFN-alphainduced upregulation of PD-1 in macrophages [37]. NFκB regulated PD-1 expression in macrophages through
binding the site located upstream of the gene in conserved
region C [38]. In addition, PD-1 can be selectively
triggered by ligation of Toll-like receptor 9, which
contributes to peripheral tolerance and autoimmunity [39].
PD-1 also affected cell cycle progression and proliferation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of T lymphocytes by suppressing the ubiquitin ligase SCF
(Skp2) through inhibiting PI3K-Akt and Ras-mitogenactivated and extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase
(MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
signaling pathways [40].
PD-L1 is induced on various cell types in response
to certain inflammatory cytokines (primarily IFN-γ),
which are produced during the immune responses of T and
natural killer (NK) cells [41]. IFN-γ-stimulated neutrophils
suppressed lymphocyte proliferation through expression
of PD-L1 [42]. The common gamma-chain cytokines IL2, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21 induced the expression of PDL1, resulting in suppressing certain effector functions of
cytokine-stimulated cells upon TCR engagement [43].
The inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-17 and IFN-γ)triggered up-regulation of PD-L1 on RPE played a critical
factor for inducing infiltrated uveitogenic T cells with
regulatory activities [44]. Recent studies indicate that the
Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT and mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were involved in IFNinduced PD-L1 expression [45, 46]. Signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) with binding to the
CD274 gene promoter was also required for PD-L1 gene
expression [47], moreover, STAT3-dependent upregulation
of PD-L1 mediated immune regulatory functions of liver
plasmacytoid DCs [48].
PD-L2, a second ligand for PD-1, is mainly
expressed on B cells, DCs, macrophages, and cultured
bone marrow (BM)-derived mast cells. Engagement of
PD-1 by PD-L2 may dramatically suppress TCR-mediated
proliferation and cytokine production by CD4+ T cells.
The expression of PD-L2 also varies depending on the
antigen concentrations [7]. At low antigen concentrations,
PD-L2-PD-1interactions suppressed TCR-B7-CD28
signals. In contrast, at high antigen concentrations, PD-L2PD-1 interactions attenuated cytokine production but did
not inhibit T cell proliferation. There are few reports about
transcriptional regulation of PD-L2. Octamer binding
protein 2 (Oct2) was demonstrated to regulate PD-L2 gene
expression in B-1 cells through lineage-specific activity
of a unique, intronic promoter [49]. Subsequently, PD-L2
cross-linking induced NF-κB -dependent protection of
dendritic cells from cell death [50].

THE ROLE OF PD-1/PD-L1 PATHWAY IN
CANCER
The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has a crucial role in
regulating immunosurveillance for tumors. PD-1 can
interfere with TCR/CD28 signals to suppress the immune
responses of T-cell help (Tc1/Th1 skewing) in the tumor
microenvironment through the PD-1/SHP-2/p-STAT1/Tbet axis [51]. Tumor cells expressing PD-1 can limit the
activity of tumor antigens (TA)-specific CD8+ T cells,
which reinforces their growth and invasiveness [52]. PD-1
is upregulated by dysfunctional TA-specific CD8+ T cells

antibody binds to PD-1 with high affinity, thereby
attenuating inhibitory signals and enhancing the host
antitumor immune responses. Nivolumab has anticancer
potential in a variety of tumor types, including melanoma,
NSCLC, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC),
Hodgkin’s lymphoma and colorectal cancer (CRC).
The first report of the safety and antitumor activity of
nivolumab was a phase I dose escalation trial [64]. In this
study, nivolumab was showed to have significant antitumor
activity but a maximum tolerated dose was not confirmed.
Since then, a large amount of clinic trials investigate the
association between nivolumab exposure and various
cancer types. Recently, Nivolumab was approved by the
US FDA in December 2014 for the treatment of patients
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Nivolumab was
also approved by the US FDA for the treatment of patients
with metastatic squamous NSCLC that returns during
or after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in
March 2015.
Melanoma is considered an “immunogenic” tumor
and high levels of PD-L1 are frequently expressed
in melanomas, leading to activation of PD-1 and
downregulation of anticancer immunity [65]. Thus,
immune checkpoint antibodies may have antitumor
potential for patients with melanoma (Table 2). A
randomized phase I clinical trial showed that nivolumab
treatment could significantly improve the median
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)
and objective response rate (ORR) [66]. Importantly,
the responses were durable and long-term safety was
acceptable. To date, no authoritative phase II clinical
trials had been reported. A phase III study evaluated
nivolumab versus dacarbazine in previously untreated
melanoma without BRAF mutation [67]. This study
suggested nivolumab significantly improved the OS
and PFS in previously untreated patients who had
metastatic melanoma without a BRAF mutation. Another
randomised, controlled, open-label, phase III trial assessed
the efficacy and safety of nivolumab versus investigator’s
choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or laterline treatment in patients with advanced melanoma [68].
As a result, ORR in nivolumab patients was reported to be
higher than that in ICC patients. Moreover, BRAF wildtype patients treated with nivolumab showed a better ORR
than that in BRAFV600 mutation-positive patients. This
clinical trial indicated that nivolumab represented a new
treatment option for the patients with advanced melanoma
that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a
BRAF inhibitor.
Similar to melanoma, NSCLC displays high
expression of PD-1 or PD-L1 [69] and blocking PD-1/
PD-L1 pathway as a therapeutical strategy was recently
evaluated in the patients with NSCLC (Table 2). The phase
I dose-escalation cohort expansion trial showed nivolumab
is effective and safe for the patients with previously
treated advanced NSCLC [70]. A phase II, single-arm trial

both in vitro and in vivo [53], and PD-1 blockade enhances
TA-specific T cell responses and inhibits tumor growth
or partial tumor regression [54]. PD-1 blockade also
increases T-cell migration to tumors by elevating IFN-γ
inducible chemokines, which augments T-cell-mediated
antitumor responses [55]. In addition, the majority of
TILs predominantly express high levels of PD-1 and are
thought to be correlated with an ‘‘exhausted’’ phenotype
and impaired antitumor immune responses [56]. This
‘‘exhausted’’ phenotype is marked by decreased T cell
proliferation, poor cytolytic activity, and low production
of type I cytokines.
PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression are up-regulated in
a variety of human cancer types. PD-L1 is frequently
expressed in several types of solid tumor cells, whereas
PD-L2 is highly expressed in certain subsets of B cell
lymphomas [57-59]. Expression of PD-L1 protein
significantly correlates with the levels of elevated
TILs, which is associated with cancer metastasis [60].
Transgenic expression of PD-L1 in immunogenic tumor
cells confers them a potent escaping from host T cell
immunity and markedly enhances their invasiveness
in vivo [61]. PD-L1 is also upregulated in tumors by
activation of key signaling pathways including PI3K,
STAT3, IFN-γ and so on. Latent membrane protein 1
(LMP1) and IFN-γ upregulate PD-L1 through STAT3,
AP-1, and NF-κB pathways, which promotes progression
of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and ovarian cancer
[41, 62]. The activation of MAPK promotes PD-L1
expression that is transcriptionally modulated by c-Jun and
augmented by STAT3 [63]. Similarly, PD-L2 expression is
observed in a subset of tumor types but its role in cancer
is far less prevalent than PD-L1. PD-L2 expression in
pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma is associated with an
increased number of CD8+ TILs and proto-oncogene MET
protein overexpression [14].

PD-1/PD-L1 BLOCKADE AND
CLINICAL APPLICATION

ITS

Based on the concept that the blockade of PD-1
or its ligands has immune-potentiating effects on cancer
cells, many monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1
pathway have been developed for the treatment of various
cancer types (Table 1). Among these anti-PD-1 antibodies,
nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have been approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma.

Nivolumab
Nivolumab (also known as ONO-4538, BMS936558 or MDX-1106) is a genetically engineered, fully
human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 immune checkpoint
inhibitor specifically targeting for human PD-1. The

indicated a positive activity of nivolumab for the patients
with advanced, refractory, squamous NSCLC [71]. These
data support that nivolumab has antitumor activity and a
manageable safety profile in previously treated patients
with advanced, refractory, squamous NSCLC. On the
basis of these encouraging results, phase III clinical trials
are further evaluating the activity of nivolumab in patients
with NSCLC.
RCC is considered as an immunogenic tumor with
dysfunctional immune cell infiltrate and PD-L1 expression
correlates with increased risk of disease progression and
cancer-specific death of the patients with this cancer type
[72]. Thus, PD-1 can function as an emerging therapeutic
target in RCC (Table 2). A phase I study with expansion
cohorts evaluated clinical activity, survival, and longterm safety in patients with advanced RCC treated with
nivolumab [73]. As a result, median OS (22.4 months) is
encouraging, and toxicities were generally manageable.
The randomized phase II trial assessed the antitumor
activity, dose-response relationship, and safety of
nivolumab in patients with metastatic RCC [74]. This
report demonstrated nivolumab had antitumor activity
with a manageable safety profile across the three doses
studied in metastatic RCC. A number of ongoing phase III
studies that will further elucidate this evidence.
In addition, nivolumab emerges antitumor potential
in Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Table 2). To determine whether
nivolumab could inhibit tumor immune evasion in patients
with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, 23 patients with relapsed or
refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma received the treatment
with nivolumab. As a result, nivolumab had substantial
therapeutic activity and an acceptable safety profile
in patients with previously heavily treated relapsed or
refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma [58]. Several results from
phase II and III clinical trials are awaited yet.

option for patients with ipilimumab-refractory advanced
melanoma. The randomized, controlled, phase III trial
compared pembrolizumab with ipilimumab in 834 patients
with advanced melanoma [76]. The results showed that
pembrolizumab could prolong PFS and OS and had less
high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with
advanced melanoma.
In NSCLC, the efficacy and safety of
pembrolizumab is currently being investigated in a phase
I trial [77]. It was indicated that pembrolizumab had
antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC,
moreover, PD-L1 expression in at least 50% of tumor
cells was shown to be correlated with improved efficacy of
pembrolizumab. In addition, pembrolizumab is currently
being investigated in a phase I/II trial in the patients with
some other cancer types, including breast cancer, bladder
cancer, and haematologic malignancies.

Pidilizumab
Pidilizumab (CT-011) is a humanized IgG1 kappa
recombinant monoclonal antibody against PD-1. In
preclinical studies, pidilizumab was demonstrated to
inhibit cancer cells survival (Table 2) [78]. In a phase
I clinical trial, pidilizumab was shown to be safe and
well tolerated in patients with advanced hematological
malignancies, and no single maximum tolerated dose was
defined in this study [79]. Two phase II trials assessed the
safety and activity. One evaluated the antitumor activity of
pidilizumab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
[80]. The other trial enrolled 32 patients with relapsed
follicular lymphoma and these patients were received
the treatment with the combination of pidilizumab and
rituximab [81]. These two trials suggested pidilizumab
was worthy of further study in follicular lymphoma.
Currently, the efficacy and safety of pidilizumab is
underway in other tumor types.

Pembrolizumab

Other anti-PD-L1 antibodies

Pembrolizumab (MK-3475), a humanized IgG4
monoclonal antibody blocking the interaction of PD-1 on
T cells with its ligands, is believed to reactivate antitumor
immunity (Table 2). A phase I trial assessed the efficacy
and safety of pembrolizumab in patients with ipilimumabrefractory advanced melanoma [75]. This study suggested
that pembrolizumab could be an effective treatment

be important to understand why some cancer patients
are sensitive to these antibodies, what are the genetic
determinants of response to this therapy.
Although early studies indicated that PD-L1
expression may be a predictable biomarker for therapeutic
response to anti-PD-1 antibodies, only a subset of patients
with NSCLC responded to PD-1 blockade, indicating the
genetic background of the cancer patients may be a key
determinant of response to this therapy. PD-L1 expression
in at least 50% of NSCLC cells correlated with improved
efficacy of pembrolizumab [77]. Recently, it was shown
that high PD-L1 expression was associated with the
presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutation in advanced lung adenocarcinoma and PDL1 overexpression was considered as a poor prognostic
indicator in EGFR wild-type patients but not in EGFR
mutant patients [84]. Another study demonstrated that
EGFR mutant tumors display elevated PD-L1 levels and
the EGFR mutant mouse showed significant response to
the treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody, indicating EGFR
mutation may be a promising biomarker of response to
this treatment [85]. In addition, higher nonsynonymous
mutation burden, the molecular smoking signature, higher

THE GENETIC DETERMINANTS OFANTIPD-1/ PD-L1 ANTIBODIES RESPONSE
Although a number of studies have reported
that anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 antibodies exhibit antitumor
immune responses in variety of cancer types, significant
interindividual variability in response attenuates its
optimal use. This may attribute to the various genetic
backgrounds of the different tumor types. Thus, it will

neoantigen burden, and DNA repair pathway mutations
were also showed to determine sensitivity to PD-1
blockade in NSCLC [86]. Moreover, long-term clinical
benefit from anti-PD-L1 therapy in lung cancer was also
discovered to be associated with JAK3 activation [87].
PD-L1 expression in advanced melanoma was
thought to be correlated with response to monoclonal
antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, moreover, the
sensitivity to PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies seemed
to be more robust in patients whose tumors express PDL1 [88, 89]. However, the potential relationship between
the BRAF mutation and PD-L1 expression has not been
determined. Several recent reports demonstrated that PDL1 expression did not correlate with BRAF mutational
status in melanoma and lung adenocarcinomas [90,
91]. Thus, the BRAF mutational status does not play a
major role in directly determining the efficiency of PD-1
pathway blockade in melanoma cells. Recently, NRAS
mutations in advanced melanoma were correlated with
increased benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy compared
with other genetic subtypes [92].
PD-L1 mRNA expression was identified to be
associated with increased tumor-infiltrating immune
cells and better outcome in breast carcinomas [93]. In
patients with RCC, the presence of PD-1(+) tumorinfiltrating immune cells was associated with more
aggressive tumors and shortened survival [12]. The
responses of MPDL3280A were observed in patients with
high expression of PD-L1, especially when PD-L1 was
expressed by tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In addition,
T-helper type 1 (TH1) gene expression, CTLA4 expression
and the absence of fractalkine (CX3CL1) in baseline
tumor specimens were also related with the response to
the anti-PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280A in cancer patients
[94]. The pre-existing CD8+ T cells were shown to be
associated with expression of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune
inhibitory axis and may predict response to PD-1 blockade
[95]. The mismatch repair deficiency is also considered as
a genomic marker to predict response to PD-1 blockade
with pembrolizumab in colorectal and other cancers [96].
Taken together, these molecular targets are important
for design of future clinical trials assessing the antitumor
potential of anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 antibodies.

inhibitors.
Nevertheless, this treatment raises many issues.
First, it is not exactly clear how PD-1 mediates their
effects since the possible molecular mechanisms by which
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies enhance the host antitumor
immune responses remain elusive. Secondly, to maximize
the potential to be applied for more stringent clinical
study, the efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 targeting
antibodies should be further investigated. Thirdly, the
determinants of the immune responses of these agents are
still unknown. Thus, it is urgent to discern more sensitive
and specific predictors of clinical outcomes in order
to identify patients who will benefit the most from the
clinical treatment. However, our increased understanding
of PD-1 mediated signal pathways will hopefully broaden
the number of therapeutic targets and perhaps provide a
prospective strategy for cancer by modulating the immune
checkpoints.

Immune checkpoint modulation as a therapeutic
strategy is attracting more and more attention in cancer
therapy. Increasing data from pre-clinical studies and
clinical trials have confirmed that anti-PD-1/PD-L1
antibodies have antitumor potential and improve cancer
patients’ survival. Currently, anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1
therapy is under individual study and in combination
with other therapies such as cytotoxic chemotherapy,
antiangiogenic agents and small-molecule tyrosine kinase
