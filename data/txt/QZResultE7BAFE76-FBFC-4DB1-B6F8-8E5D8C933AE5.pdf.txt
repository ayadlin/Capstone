ABSTRACT
The efficacious practice of precision personalized medicine requires a more exact
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug, hence then it is necessary to
identify the binding site of the drugs derived from natural sources. In the study, we
investigated the suppressive effect and underlying mechanism of isoliquiritigenin
(2′,4′,4-trihydroxychalcone; ILG), a phyto-flavonoid, on human T lymphocyte activation
in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that ILG dose-dependently suppressed human
T cell activation via suppressing IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, NF-κB nuclear
translocation and IKKβ activity. Molecular docking results predicted that cysteine 46
(Cys-46) is probably the binding site of ILG on IKKβ, and this prediction has been
validated by competition assay and kinase assay. To further verify the binding site
of this compound in vivo, IKKβC46A transgenic (IKKβC46A) mice were generated. We
found that ILG had a less potent immune-suppressive effect in homozygous IKKβC46A
mice than IKKβ wild type (IKKβ wt) littermates with the delay-type hypersensitivity
(DTH), suggesting that ILG cannot significantly suppress the inflammation due to the
mutation of Cys-46 in the transgenic mice. Collectively, our findings indicate that the
ILG inhibited T cell activation in vivo and in vitro via directly binding to IKKβ Cys46.

INTRODUCTION

induces apoptosis in human glioma cells, human
hepatoma cells and gastric cancer cells [4–7]. In addition,
ILG reduces H2 histamine receptor (H2R) activity and
gastric acid secretion thereby protecting against gastric
mucosal lesion formation in a pylorus-ligated rat model
[8]. Regarding its anti-inflammatory activities, ILG
markedly suppresses lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
expression, nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-1β (IL-1β),
and tumor necrosis factors-α (TNF-α) production, and
induces heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression through the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway
in RAW 264.7 macrophages [9, 10]. Recently, it has been
reported that ILG blocks TNF-α-induced expression of
cell adhesion molecules in human endothelial cells by
attenuating IκB kinase activity and ROS generation [11].
However, the effect of ILG on human T lymphocytes has
not been well examined.

With the advent of the Human Genome Project,
the uniqueness of individuals and the importance of
personalized medicine have been realized to provide
more appropriate healthcare. However, it offers the
challenges about identification of the accurate binding
site of drugs. In the present study, the immunosuppressive
effect, underlying mechanism and molecular binding
site of isoliquiritigenin (ILG; 2′,4′,4-trihydroxychalcone
(Figure 1A)) have been investigated on activated
T lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo.
ILG, a member of the flavonoids, belongs to the
chalcone family that is found in licorice, shallot and bean
sprouts, and other medicinal herbs such as Sinofranchetia
chinensis. The compound possesses various biological
activities, including anti-inflammatory, antitumor and
antihistamine effects in vitro and in vivo [1, 2]. It also

It is known that T lymphocytes play important roles
in the development of autoimmune and inflammatory
diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, contact dermatitis
and systemic lupus erythematosus. In this connection,
suppression of T cell activation is a dominant strategy
in the clinical management of autoimmune disorders.
T lymphocyte proliferation relies on NF-κB activation,
which facilitates the production of a series of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby aggravating autoimmune
disease activity [12]. IκB kinase β (IKKβ) is the key
regulator of NF-κB, hence then IKKβ has become an
attractive therapeutic target for developing new drugs for
treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
In the current study, we investigated the
immunosuppressive effect of ILG via inhibiting NF-κB
signaling in T lymphocytes. Molecular docking results
predicted that IKKβ Cys-46 is probably the binding
site of ILG. A competition assay and a kinase assay
were performed to validate the virtual docking results.
IKKC46A transgenic mice were also generated and used
to demonstrate that IKKβ Cys-46 is involved in the
suppressive effect of ILG in vivo.

determines cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, hence
then we further examined the effect of ILG on the cell
cycle progression. As shown in Figure 2C, cycling of
P/I-mediated cells was progressing from G0/G1 to S and
G2-M phase, whereas it was blocked at the G0/G1 phase
by ILG at 25 μM.

ILG suppresses CD69 and CD25 expression on
human T lymphocyte surfaces
T cell surface activation markers, including CD69,
CD25 and CD71, accompany the entry of T cells through
G0/G1 to S phase. It has been demonstrated that ILG dosedependently arrested cell cycle from 5 to 25 μM; therefore,
we further investigated the effect of ILG on the expression
of T cell surface activation markers. The results showed
that the expression of CD69, CD25 and CD71 were
56.7%, 36.8% and 51.3% on human T cells stimulated
with P/I, whereas ILG reduced the expression of CD69 and
CD25 to 12.3% and 5.4% (Figure 3A–3B), respectively.
Interestingly, we observed that ILG exhibited the opposite
effect on CD71, showing it slightly up-regulated CD71
expression from 51.3% to 57.2% (Figure 3C).

RESULTS

ILG inhibits IKK-IκBα-NF-κB signaling of
human T lymphocytes

ILG inhibits human T lymphocyte proliferation
and division

NF-κB signaling plays a crucial role in T cell
activation [14]. We therefore evaluated the effect of ILG
on IκBα-NF-κB signaling on human T lymphocytes.
Considering the pivotal role of the transcriptional factor in
the pathway, we examined whether ILG could inhibit the
expression of NF-κB p65 in the nucleus of T lymphocytes.
As shown in Figure 4A, P/I stimulation could elevate
p65 nuclear translocation, and ILG dose-dependently
suppressed the p65 expression in the nucleus of T cells.
As p65 nuclear translocation is regulated by IκBα
phosphorylation and degradation, we investigated whether
the inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation results from
a suppressive effect of ILG on IκBα phosphorylation
and degradation. As shown in the upper panel of
Figure 4B, ILG markedly suppressed IκBα degradation
in a dose-dependent manner. To further determine
whether the reduction of IκBα degradation was a result
of the inhibitory effect ILG on IκBα phosphorylation,
we used the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-leucylleucyl-norleucinal (ALLN) to block the degradation of
IκBα, and treated the cells by P/I with or without ILG.
The results showed that ILG strongly suppressed IκBα
phosphorylation (Figure 4B, lower panel). In addition, it
has been reported that stimulus-induced phosphorylation
of IκBα regulated by the IKK could be rapidly degraded
by an ubiquitin-26S proteasome [14]. Considering the
inhibition effect of ILG on the phosphorylation and
degradation of IκBα, we investigated the effect of ILG on
IKK-α/β phosphorylation, and the results clearly showed

Because proliferation is one of the hallmarks of T
cell activation, we first investigated the inhibitory effect
of ILG on the proliferation of human T cells purified from
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), The
results clearly demonstrated that ILG dose-dependently
blocked T cell proliferation generated by PMA plus
ionomycin (P/I) from 5 to 25 μM (Figure 1B).
It has been reported that carboxyfluorescein
diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) could be used to
monitor the number of cell divisions during proliferation
and examine the relationship between proliferation
and differentiation [13]. We therefore used CFSE to
demonstrate the effect of ILG on cell division. The results
showed that ILG significantly reduced the number of cell
divisions at 10 μM and almost totally blocked the number
of cell divisions at 25 μM (Figure 1C and Table 1).

ILG blocks IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion, as well as
cell cycle progression in human T lymphocytes
As mentioned above, T cell proliferation is one of
the hallmarks of T cell activation; the other hallmark is
the T cell growth factor secretion, including IFN-γ and
IL-2. We therefore further investigated the effect of ILG
on cytokine secretion. As shown in Figure 2A and  2B,
ILG significantly and dose-dependently suppressed
the expression of both cytokines, which were greatly
induced by P/I in T lymphocytes. Cell cycle commitment

Statistically significant differences with respect to P/I are expressed as *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01. Data represent the mean ±
S.E.M. of three independent experiments
that ILG significantly and dose-dependently suppresses
IKKα/β phosphorylation (Figure 4C, upper panel). It was
reported that IKKα regulates IKKβ kinase activity by
phosphorylating IKKβ [15], and the effect of ILG on IKKα
phosphorylation has been determined in the current study.
Interestingly, ILG showed no significant effect on IKKα
phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S1), suggesting
that the compound may have specific inhibitory effect on
IKKβ phosphorylation.
Recent studies have demonstrated that the
phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-536 by IKKβ contributes to
NF-κB transcriptional activity [16]. Because ILG inhibits
NF-κB nucleus translocation in an IκB-dependent manner,
we investigated whether p65 phosphorylation suppressed
by ILG is dispensable for NF-κB inhibition. The results
show that 25 μM ILG almost completely abolished
phospho-Ser536 p65 levels by using an antibody specific
for phospho-Ser536 p65 (Figure 4C, lower panel). Hence
then, we determined whether ILG directly influences IKKβ
and then suppressed phosphorylation of p65 and IκBα by
a kinase assay. As shown in Figure 4D, the substrate of

IKKβ, IκBα, phosphorylation was suppressed by ILG as
well as dihydromyricetin (DMY), the reference compound
[18], implying that ILG inhibits IKK-IκBα-NF-κB
signaling of human T lymphocytes via the regulation of
IKKβ activity.

ILG suppresses IKKβ activity via binding to
Cys-46
To determine whether ILG inhibits IKKβ activity via
directly binding to IKKβ, we conducted molecular docking
modeling to predict whether IKKβ is the molecular
binding site of ILG. According to our results, the docking
score of ILG with wild-type IKKβ and its C46A mutant
are -12.23 and -11.76, respectively. Figure 5A illustrates
the binding mode of ILG with IKKβ, showing that ILG
probably binds to IKKβ by hydrophobic, polar, and
hydrogen bond interactions at Cys-46.
In the wild-type system, the hydrophobic groups of
ILG form hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of
Phe26, Gly27, Val29, Cys46, Leu50, Leu178, Cys179, and

Thr180. The polar groups of ILG exhibit polar interactions
with the side chains of Arg47, Gln48, Glu49, Lys53,
Asn54, Arg57, Arg144, Glu177, and Glu181 (Figure 5A,
left panel). In addition, ILG forms hydrogen bonds with
the backbone of Gln48 and the side chains of Lys53,
Arg57, and Leu178.
In the C46A mutant system, the binding mode of
ILG in IKKβ was changed due to the C46A mutation of the
protein. The hydrophobic groups of ILG form hydrophobic
interactions with the side chains of Phe26, Gly27, Val29,
Ala46, Leu50, Leu178, Cys179, and Thr180. The polar
groups of ILG exhibit polar interactions with the side
chains of Arg47, Gln48, Glu49, Lys53, Asn54, Arg57,
Arg144, Glu177, and Glu181. In addition, ILG forms
hydrogen bonds with the backbone of Gln48 and Glu177
and the side chains of Arg57, and Leu178 (Figure 5A, right
panel). Collectively, the molecular docking results suggest
that IKKβ Cys-46 is probably the binding site of ILG.
To further verify whether the inhibitory effect of ILG
on IKKβ activity is associated with targeting of Cys-46

of the protein, single point mutant IKKβ constructs
in which Cys-46 is replaced with alanine (A) (IKKβ
C46A) by site-directed mutagenesis were generated. The
in vitro IKKβ kinase assay showed that IKKβ C46A has
no response to ILG and DMY (Figure 5B). By contrast,
berberine, which is reported to target IKKβ on Cys-179
[18], could suppress the IKKβ C46A activity, implying
that Cys-46 is the target of ILG and DMY and not the
target of berberine.
In our previous study, it was found that
biotinylated-DMY (biotin-DMY) directly binds to IKKβ
Cys46 via a covalent bond [18]. Considering the virtual
computational docking results of ILG on IKKβ, we
utilized DMY-biotin, the validated probe, to determine
whether ILG binding IKKβ C46A relies on covalent
bonds. Therefore, a competition assay was performed
with reducing SDS-PAGE. As shown in Figure 5C the
signal of DMY-biotin could be easily found, whereas the
DMY-biotin signal was significantly reduced in addition
of ILG. Increases in ILG amount resulted in less DMY-

biotin signal, suggesting that the binding sites of ILG and
DMY-biotin overlap. Collectively, these results show that
IKKβ Cys46 is the molecular target of ILG via covalent
binding in vitro.

Interestingly, we observed that ILG could not reduce
thymus spleen weight in both IKKβ wt and IKKβC46A
mutant mice (Figure 6B–6C). Collectively, these results
suggest that IKKβ Cys-46 is the molecular target of ILG
to suppress T cell activation in vivo without significant
toxicity.

The anti-inflammatory effect of ILG was
abolished in IKKβC46A transgenic mice

DISCUSSION

The above results demonstrated that ILG possessed
the immune-suppressive effect on human T cells via
covalent binding IKKβ Cys46 in vitro. To further
elucidate whether the immune-suppressive effect of ILG
on the T cell activation is the result of mediating Cys46 of IKKβ in vivo, we generated IKKβC46A transgenic
mice and conducted a delay-type hypersensitivity (DTH)
experiment, a mouse inflammatory model for atopic
dermatitis triggered by T cells. The results showed that
the immune-suppressive effect of ILG was less potent
in homozygous IKKβC46A mutant mice than in IKKβ
wt mice (Figure 6A, Supplementary Table S1), which
corroborates the in vitro results. The reference compound,
dexamethasone, could significantly suppress edema and
simultaneously induced the atrophy of thymus and spleen.

Genomic variation plays an important role in the
understanding of disease predisposition, biology and
clinical response to therapy through effects on gene
structure and expression. Advances in human genome
research are opening the door to a new paradigm
for practicing medicine that promises to transform
healthcare [19]. Based on this concept, the personalized
precision medicine, tailoring the practice of medicine
to the individual, was recently initiated [19]. Under this
premise, it is becoming more important to elucidate
and verify the molecular target of the compounds being
used for treatment. In recent years, medicinal plants are
becoming an attractive source for drug discovery; for
example, veregen, a mixture of flavonoids derived from

medicinal plants, was approved by the FDA in 2006
to treat external genital and perianal warts. Although
herbal medicines provide an extensive resource for the
development of new drugs, the underlying mechanisms
and molecular targets of the most compounds have not
been well expounded. For example, pseudolaric acid B,
which is derived from Chinese medicinal herb, has not

been identified for its molecular target on the suppression
on T cells [20]. ILG is a major chemical component of
licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis), which is one of the most
commonly used to “harmonize” other ingredients in
Chinese medical formulas [21, 22], and ILG is effective in
the prevention and treatment of inflammatory conditions
[23–24]. However, the function of ILG in T cells has not

been studied. Our current study is the first to report the
immune-suppressive effect, underlying mechanism, as
well as molecular target of the compound in T cells.
In the present study, we have shown for the first
time that ILG, not only inhibits human T lymphocyte
proliferation and division stimulated by PMA/ionomycin
in a dose-dependent manner, but it also reduces the PMA/
ionomycin-mediated human T lymphocyte cytokine
secretion including IL-2 and IFN-γ, indicating that ILG
could suppress T cell activation. We further found that
ILG treatment could prevent cells from entering cell cycle,
implying that ILG-induced cell cycle arrest might further
contribute to the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and the
production of the growth factors of T cells including IL-2
and IFN-γ. In addition, ILG could significantly attenuate
CD69 and CD25 (IL-2 receptor) expression, and both
of two markers were applied to evaluate the degree of
immune responses. Interestingly, ILG slightly activates
CD71, which is a marker of late stage T cell activation,
implying that ILG probably has an influence on the early
stages of T cell activation.
Because NF-κB suppresses CD25 expression, IL-2
production and T-cell proliferation, we further proposed
that ILG might inhibit T-cell activation by blocking NF-κB

signaling. Our expectation was confirmed that ILG could
suppress the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, as
well as NF-κB activity and phosphorylation of p65.
Since persistent activation of the NF-κB signaling
pathway is often associated with many inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases, we therefore conducted intensive
investigations on this signaling with ILG intervention.
IKKβ is a component of the IKK complex that serves as
a protein subunit of IκB kinase, and plays a central role in
the regulation of NF-κB signaling in response to a diverse
set of extracellular stimuli [26]. According to literature
reports, IKKβ harbors four binding sites, including ATP, Ser177/181, Cys-179 and Cys-662/716 binding sites [27–30].
In our previous study, we found IKKβ can also offer a fifth
binding site, Cys-46 of the protein [19], and it has been
reported that a synthesized compound, ainsliadimer A,
covalently binds to the conserved cysteine [31]. Ainsliadimer
A could obviously inhibit IκBα phosphorylation and
degradation at 8 μM in macrophage and cancer cell lines.
Our current study demonstrated that ILG was able to
significantly suppress NF-κB signaling in T lymphocytes at
25 μM. Although the different cells were employed in the
studies, it could be speculated that ainsliadimer A has more
potential than ILG to inhibit the NF-κB signaling.

Molecular docking programs are widely used as
modeling tools for predicting ligand binding modes,
as well as for a structure-based virtual screening
approach [32]. To explore the binding site of ILG, we
used computational tools for target identification and
predicted that ILG probably binds to the Cys-46 of
IKKβ. Furthermore, we conducted a kinase assay to
demonstrate that mutation of IKKβ Cys-46 could abrogate
the suppressive effect of ILG on the activity of IKKβ,
which provided the evidence showing that Cys-46 of
IKKβ is the binding site of ILG. Biotin-DMY has been
identified binding to IKKβ Cys-46 in our previous study
[18], and used as a probe to conduct a competition assay
to demonstrate the molecular target of ILG on IKKβ. We
found that berberine, targeting on the Cys-179 of IKKβ
[17], still has the ability to inhibit the kinase activity of
IKKβ C46A and wt, and the competition assay provided
the evidence to show that Cys-46 is not the binding site of
berberine on IKKβ. In concert with in vitro results, ILG
has no significant immune-suppressive effect on IKKβC46A
transgenic mice, whereas it shows significant inhibitory
effect on IKKβ wt mice in a DTH animal model, which
is mediated by T cells. Collectively, ILG alleviated
IKKβ activity via binding on Cys-46 and then reduced
the degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα, prevented
NF-κB nuclear translocation, arrested human T cell cycle
progression, cytokine secretion and T cell proliferation,
eventually mediated the immune-suppressive effect
on human T cells. In concert with in vitro results, the
inhibitory effect of ILG was almost abolished completely
in homozygous IKKβC46A mutant mice. In summary,
all of our results clearly demonstrate that the immunesuppressive effect of ILG in T cells in vivo and in vitro
results from binding on the IKKβ Cys-46.
Because the MAPK family plays a crucial role in
triggering the immune response, we also examined the
effect of ILG on the signaling. Our results clearly showed
that ILG has no obvious effect on MAPKs signaling
(Supplementary Figure S2), indicating that ILG has more
intensive effects on IKKβ-NF-κB signaling than MAPKs.
As ILG possesses a selective property on suppressing
IKKβ activity, it is valuable to be further investigated
on ILG as a lead compound into an immunosuppressive
agent with clear molecular mechanisms for applications
in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in the future.

(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to determine
the amount of IL-2 and IFN-γ secreted by the activated
human T lymphocytes. Briefly, cells (1 × 105/well) were
incubated in the presence or absence of ILG at different
concentrations, For stimulated with PMA plus inomycin,
the cells were pretreated with ILG for 2 h at different
concentrations, and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml PMA
plus 1 μM ionomycin for another 48 h. Finally, the culture
supernatants were collected, and then concentration of IL-2
and IFN-γ in the supernatants was evaluated by ELISA
method according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data
were obtained from three independent experiments.

To evaluate the phosphorylation form of IκBα,
human T lymphocytes (4 × 106/well) were pretreated with
ILG at different concentrations followed by 100 μg/ml
N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN) (Calbiochem,
USA) for 60 min, and the cells were then incubated with
PMA (20 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (1 μM) for another
60 min. For determination of IκBα, P-IKKα/b, P-p65
and b-actin from whole cellular proteins, the human T
lymphocytes (4 × 106/well) were stimulated with PMA
plus ionomycin for 1 h after pre-incubated with different
concentrations of ILG for 120 min. The T lymphocytes
were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (Sigma) with
1 × protease inhibitor mix (Roche) to prepare the whole
cellular lysates. For NF-κB nuclear translocation assay, the
cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of T cells were prepared
by using NE-PER™ Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction
(thermo fisher scientific, USA). The whole cellular or
nucleus extracts were then subjected to electrophoresis in
10% SDS/PAGE and to immunoblotting according to the
previous method [37].

T lymphocyte surface marker, intercellular
protein, CFSE and cell cycle analysis
The expressions of T lymphocyte activation markers,
including CD25, CD69 and CD71, were measured by flow
cytometry according to the previously described method
[34]. The cells (1 × 106/well) was pretreated with ILG for
2 h, followed by stimulated with PMA (20 ng/ml) plus
ionomycin (1 μM) [34]. To determine the expression of
CD69, the cells were stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin
for 24 h; to evaluate the expressions of CD25 and CD71,
the cells were incubated with stimulators for 48 h. After
collection, the cells were stained with indicated antibodies,
and incubated for 30 min at room temperature avoiding
from light, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA). On the next day, samples were analyzed on FACS
Calibur Flow Cytometer using CellQuest software. The
separate tubes of cells stained with single-color antibodies
for each of the flourochromes were severed as the
compensation standards.
For analysis of cell cycle, human T lymphocytes
(106/well) were pretreated with ILG for 2 h followed
by stimulated with or without PMA (20 ng/ml) plus
ionomycin (1 μM) for 72 h. After collected, washed by
PBS and fixed by 70% ethanol, the cells were stained by
PI (Propidium Iodide, BD Pharmingen,San Diego, USA)
for 30 min at room temperature, and then the cell cycle
was analyzed by flow cytometry [35].
To monitor the number of cell divisions during
proliferation, the division tracking dye carboxyfluorescein
diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) was used according to
the previous method [36]. In brief, the cells were incubated
with pre-warmed PBS/0.1% BSA at a final concentration
of 1 × 106 cells/mL. Two μL of 5 μM stock CFSE solution
was added to the cells at final working concentration of
10 μM. After incubated with the dye at 37°C for 10 min,
the cells were added ice-cold culture medium and

Transfection and immunoprecipitation
The transfection assay was preformed according
to the manufacturer’s instruction of lipofectamine LTX
(invitrogen, USA). In brief, HEK293 cells were seeded
in 1.5 ml of DMEM growth media plus 10% FBS at
5 × 105 cells per well. Five hundred microliter Opti-MEM
Reduced Serum Media containing 1.25 μg of DNA was
added to the cells to be transfected, and then 1.25 μl of
PLUS was added into the above diluted Opti-MEM:DNA
solution, gently mixed and incubated for another 5 min
at room temperature. Subsequently, lipofectamine LTX™
Reagent was added into the above solution, and then
mixed gently and incubated 30 min at room temperature
to form DNA-lipofectamine LTX Reagent complexes.
Finally, 500 μl of the DNA-lipofectamine LTX Reagent
complexes was directly added to each well containing
cells and mixed gently. The cells were incubated at 37°C
in a CO2 incubator for 24 h.
Immunoprecipitation was used to pull down IKKβ
recombinant protein from HEK 293 cells overexpressing
Flag-IKKβ according to the manufacture’s instruction of
Flag tagged protein immunoprecipitation Kit (Sigma).
Briefly, HEK293 cells were harvested and lysed by
incubation with lysis buffer for 15 min on ice, after
transfected with Flag-IKKβ for 24 h. The lysate was
collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g,
cell lysates were then added to the resin provided by the
34232

Oncotarget

kit. The resin was collected by centrifuging for 30 s at
8200 × g after agitated for overnight at 4°C. The FlagIKKβ was eluted by competition with 3 × Flag peptide,
and stored at −80°C or further conduct IKKβ kinase assay
and competition assay.

using Site Finder in MOE software. The identified binding
site including residue Cys46 was chosen as the binding
site for molecular docking according to our experiment. In
molecular docking, the Triangle Matcher placement method
and London dG scoring function were used. A total of 30
docking poses were generated for the ligand and the pose
with the best binding mode was selected for further analysis.

IKKβ kinase assay
To determine the effect of ILG on IKKβ activity,
the IKKβ kinase assay was performed. Briefly, IκBα
substrate supplied by Enzo Life Science (Farmingdale,
NY, USA), Flag-IKKβ recombinant protein, and ATP were
incubated with or without ILG at 30°C for 30 min. The
mixture was analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then electro-transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose
membranes were incubated with P-IκBα (Ser32/36)
for overnight at 4°C after blocked by 5% dried milk for
60 min. Next day, the membranes were further incubated
with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60 min,
and developed using ECL Western Blotting Detection
Reagents (Life Technologies).

IKK-βC46A transgenic mice
The IKK-βC46A transgenic mice were generated by
Shanghai Biomodel Organism Science & Technology
Development Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The transgenic
mice were validated by PCR and gene sequencing. The
IKK-βC46A mice have been backcrossed to C57BL/6 for 6
generations in our experiments, and the wild-type
littermates were served as control. They were kept
under 12:12 h cycle of light with ad libitum access
to food and drink. All mice were kept under specific
pathogen-free conditions in the animal care facility at
Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese
Medicine. Animal care and experiments were conducted
in accordance with the Laboratory Animal Research
Committee Guidelines of Guangdong Provincial Hospital
of Traditional Chinese medicine.

Competition assay
Flag-IKKβ wild type (wt) was precipitated from
HEK 293 overexpressing Flag-IKKβ, and incubated with
ILG or DMY for 1h and then 100 μM DMY-biotin was
added to the mixture. Subsequently, the proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitro-cellulose
membranes. After blocking with BSA and washing with
PBST, the membranes were incubated with streptavidin
horseradish peroxidase for 1 h and developed with
enhanced chemiluminescence. Finally, the membranes
were incubated with anti-Flag antibody to evaluate the
expression of Flag-IKKβ.

DTH animal model
Mice were sensitized through topical application
onto their shaved abdomens of 20 µl of a 0.5%
DNFB in 4:1 acetone/olive oil mixture on days 0 and
1(sensitization phase). Five days after sensitization, the
mice were challenged on day 6 with application of 20 µl
of a 0.5% DNFB in 4 : 1 acetone/olive oil mixture to
the left inner and outer surfaces of the mice (elicitation
phase). Ear thickness measurements of both the treatment
and control/blank groups were taken with an electronic
digital caliper at 24, 48 and 72 h after challenge and the
response quantitated as the difference in the thickness of
the challenged ear.

Computational methods
The initial 3D structure of ILG was built using the
Molecule Builder module incorporated in MOE software.
The structure was then subjected to energy minimization
and partial charges calculation with Amber99 force field.
The crystal structure of wild-type inhibitor of κB kinase β
(IKKβ) was retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID code
3RZF [38]). On the basis of the wild type protein structure,
the structure of IKKβ with C46A mutant was obtained by
performing single point mutation with Rotamer Explorer
in MOE software. To prepare the protein for molecular
docking, the protein structure was subjected to partial
charges calculation and energy minimization with Amber99
force field. Energy minimization was terminated when the
root mean square gradient falls below 0.05 kcal/(mol·Å).
The prepared proteins and ligand were introduced
for molecular docking. The docking site was identified by

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means ± S.E.M. One-way
ANOVA or Student’s t-test was used to determine the
significance of difference; a value of p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
