ABSTRACT
Currently, Stathmin1 (STMN1) and phospho-STMN1 levels in breast cancers and
their clinical implications are unknown. We examined the expression of STMN1 and its
serine phospho-site (Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63) status by immunohistochemistry.
Using Cox regression analysis, a STMN1 expression signature and phosphorylation
profile plus clinicopathological characteristics (STMN1-E/P/C) was developed in the
training set (n = 204) and applied to the validation set (n = 106). This tool enabled
us to separate breast cancer patients into high- and low-risk groups with significantly
different disease-free survival (DFS) rates (P < 0.001). Importantly, this STMN1-E/P/C
model had a greater prognostic value than the traditional TNM classifier, especially in
luminal subtype breast cancer (P = 0.002). Further analysis showed that patients in
the low-risk group would benefit more from adjuvant paclitaxel-based chemotherapy
(P = 0.002). In conclusion, the STMN1-E/P/C signature is a reliable prognostic
indicator for luminal subtype breast cancer and may predict the therapeutic response
to paclitaxel-based treatments, potentially facilitating individualized management.

Stathmin (STMN1), also known as Oncoprotein 18
(Op 18), is a ubiquitous, highly conserved 18-kDa cytosolic
phosphoprotein which increases the rate of mitosis through
upregulation of microtubule dynamics [5]. STMN1 has
4 serine phosphorylation sites (Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and
Ser63). Phosphorylation at either Ser16 or Ser63 strongly
reduces or abolishes the ability of STMN1 to bind to and
sequester soluble tubulin [6], while phosphorylation at
Ser38 may be a novel biomarker of increased tumor cell
proliferation and impaired prognosis [7]. STMN1 Ser16
can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC), PAK1,
or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II/IV [8–11], whereas
Ser25 and Ser38 are targeted by mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)
[12, 13]. Multisite phosphorylation of STMN1 generates
different combinations of STMN1 phosphoisomers that

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed
cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity
and mortality among women worldwide [1]. As a
heterogeneous disease, comprehensive gene expression
profiling has distinguished four major molecular subtypes
of breast cancer with different clinical outcomes: luminal
A, luminal B, HER2/neu and triple-negative [2–4]. The
luminal A and B subtypes are collectively referred to as
the luminal type, which accounts for 65–70% of breast
cancers. Compared with other breast cancers, patients with
luminal subtypes benefit from endocrine therapies and
have a better prognosis. However, long-term recurrence
remains a major clinical problem. Additional markers to
individualize treatment and prognosis are urgently needed.

STMN1 expression and its serine phosphorylation
status is associated with DFS in breast cancer

contribute to the overall regulation of cell invasion and
cancer metastasis. However, the prognostic impact and
possible clinical value of STMN1 phosphorylation has
not been extensively studied in human cancers, though the
impact of phosphorylation at different STMN1 phosphosites has been explored in some experimental models,
primarily in relation to the effects on microtubule formation,
proliferation, cell migration, and cancer invasion [6, 14, 15].
To our knowledge, although adjuvant chemotherapy
could effectively reduce the risk of metastasis and
mortality for women with operable disease, only a fraction
of patients benefit from this treatment. Paclitaxel, a
microtubule-stabilizing drug, is a common cytotoxic agent
that has been used extensively in recent years. However,
resistance to paclitaxel is a major obstacle in anticancer
treatment. Therefore, we explored the possible interaction
between STNM1 phosphorylation status and breast cancer
response towards paclitaxel-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
In this study, we evaluated the protein levels of
STMN1 and its phosphorylated forms in primary breast
cancer specimens to develop a STMN1-based classifier
to predict disease-free survival (DFS) for breast cancer
patients using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards
model with two independent cohorts. We also assessed
the prognostic accuracy of this classifier in various breast
cancer molecular subtypes. Additionally, we compared
its prognostic and predictive accuracy against traditional
clinicopathological risk factors, and investigated the
classifier’s predictive value for patient benefit from
adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.

Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that STMN1, Ser25
and Ser38 were strongly associated with poorer DFS
(P = 0.044 for STMN1, P = 0.045 for Ser25, P = 0.009
for Ser38), whereas Ser16 and Ser63 were associated with
better DFS (P = 0.015 for Ser16, P = 0.010 for Ser63). Our
analysis in the validation cohort displayed a similar trend
for these associations (P = 0.016 for STMN1, P = 0.014
for Ser16, P = 0.034 for Ser25, P = 0.032 for Ser38, and
P = 0.016 for Ser63, Figure 1). As shown in Table 2, both
univariate and adjusted multivariate survival analyses
revealed a significant difference between the positive- and
negative-staining groups for each marker. In the training
cohort, cases with high STMN1 expression had a higher
likelihood of disease events (HR = 1.829, 95% CI: 1.007–
3.322, P = 0.047). Phosphorylation at Ser25 (HR = 1.817,
95% CI: 1.004–3.286, P = 0.048) and Ser38 (HR = 2.136,
95% CI: 1.190–3.832, P = 0.011) were also prognostic
factors for poor DFS. In contrast, phosphorylation at
Ser16 (HR = 0.488, 95% CI: 0.270–0.882, P = 0.018) and
Ser63 (HR = 0.467, 95% CI: 0.258–0.844, P = 0.012) were
tightly associated with improved DFS. In the validation set,
we found similar trends with poor DFS for STMN1 (HR =
2.786, 95% CI: 1.165–6.660, P = 0.021), phosphorylation
at Ser25 (HR = 2.547, 95% CI: 1.037–6.253, P = 0.041)
and phosphorylation at Ser38 (HR = 2.506, 95% CI: 1.050–
5.981, P = 0.038), whereas phosphorylation at Ser16 (HR
= 0.328, 95% CI: 0.128–0.840, P = 0.020) and Ser63 (HR
= 0.372, 95% CI: 0.161–0.862, P = 0.021) were correlated
with prolonged DFS in breast cancer patients.

STMN1 expression and serine phosphorylation

In the training set, the median age of the 204 patients
was 51 years (range 29–84 years), and the median followup time was 102 months (range 0.5–144 months). In the
validation set, the median age of the 106 patients was 55
years (range 34–85 years), and the median follow-up time
was 79 months (range 2–81 months). 25 Cases which either
lacked follow-up data or experienced tissue loss after IHC
staining were excluded. 68 patients experienced distant
metastasis in the two sets (Table 1). Immunohistochemical
staining for STMN1 (145/310, 46.8% positive), Ser16
(156/310, 50.3% positive), Ser25 (146/310, 47.1% positive),
Ser38 (122/310, 39.4% positive), Ser63 (207/310, 66.8%
positive) was reviewed and analyzed by two individual
pathologists for both sets (Figure 1).
The correlations between patients’ clinical char­
acteristics and levels of total STMN1 and phosphoSTMN1 forms are summarized in Supplementary Table
S1. No significant differences were observed between the
markers and clinicopathological characteristics.

A Cox proportional hazards model was used to
build a prognostic classifier [16], which included STMN1
expression and the phosphorylation status of the four
phospho-serine sites identified in the training cohort. Here,
we derived a formula to calculate a score for metastatic
risk in terms of DFS for each patient based on the
individual status of those five markers, where risk score =
0.251*STMN1–0.497*Ser16+0.701*Ser25+0.594*Ser38–
0.534*Ser63. In this formula, low expression levels
of STMN1 and low phosphorylation levels of
phosphorylation at the serine sites are equal to 0, and high
levels are equal to 1.
Based on this STMN1 expression and phos­
phorylation (STMN1-E/P) model, we assessed the
prognostic accuracy of the risk score with a timedependent ROC analysis, it trended towards a higher
prognostic accuracy than TNM staging, a traditional
prognostic classifier for cancer patients (AUC for

STMN1-E/P model: 0.719; AUC for TNM staging: 0.658;
Figure 2A). To generate the optimum cutoff score, we
used Youden index based on the ROC curve, and chose
0 as the best cutoff risk score [17]. Thus, we classifieded
the patients with a risk score of 0 or higher into the highrisk group, and those with a risk score lower than 0 were
classified into the low-risk group. By assessing the risk
score distribution and DFS status, we found that patients
in the low-risk group generally had better survival than
the high-risk group (HR = 3.029, 95% CI: 1.599–5.737,
P < 0.001; Figure 2B). By using Pearson χ2 test, several
clinicopathological factors, including histological grade,
tumor size and lymphatic metastasis, were tightly
associated with the STMN1-E/P model driven risk score
in the training cohort (Supplementary Table S2).
To confirm the prognostic value of the STMN1-E/P
model, the model was applied to the validation set of 106
patients to predict the risk of metastasis for each patient
(Table 1). It also had a better prognostic value than TNM
staging (AUC for STMN1-E/P model: 0.775; AUC for
TNM stage: 0.698; Figure 2C). In addition, the KaplanMeier analysis showed a significant difference between
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the high- and low-risk groups in the validation cohort (HR
= 4.371, 95% CI: 1.478–12.930, P = 0.004; Figure 2D).
To further optimize this classifier, all pathological
variables and biological markers were subjected to a
univariate analysis. Eight separate prognostic factors
emerged: STMN1, Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, Ser63,
histological grade, tumor size and lymphatic metastasis.
Multivariate Cox model analysis indicated that these
factors were also independent predictors of breast cancer
metastasis. Using the multivariate Cox proportional
hazards model, we calculated a new risk score for
individuals to include these factors, where risk score =
0.173*STMN1–0.608*Ser16+0.743*Ser25+0.685* Ser38–
0.342*Ser63+0.459*histological
grade+0.448*tumor
size+0.946*lymphatic metastasis. This new risk score
shows an even better prognostic value than the TNM stage
both in the training set and the validation set (AUC for
STMN1-E/P/C model: 0.812; AUC for TNM stage: 0.658,
P < 0.001 for the training set; AUC for STMN1-E/P/C
model: 0.850; AUC for TNM stage: 0.698, P = 0.023 for
the validation set) (Figure 3A and 3C). We defined a cutoff
score of 2.2 by ROC analysis for this STMN1-E/P/C model.

The risk score was tightly associated with a group of wellknown clinical features (Supplementary Table S3). Further
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that this novel STMN1E/P/C model was able to identify a significant difference in
clinical outcome between the high- and low-risk groups in
both the training set (HR = 6.792, 95% CI: 3.159–14.604,

(HR = 3.736, 95% CI: 1.387–10.129, P = 0.002). No
significant differences in DFS were observed between
the high- and low-risk groups in the HER2 enrichment
and triple-negative subtypes (P = 0.213 for Her2-positive
and P = 0.363 for TNBC; Figure 3E–3G). These findings
suggested that the risk score of the STMN1-E/P/C model
had the greatest prognostic value specifically for the
luminal subtype of breast cancer.

NOTE: Multivariate analysis of interaction was conducted in two steps. In the first step, the Cox regression model included
established prognostic factors (age, menopausal status, lymph node status, tumor size, histological grade, ER, PR, HER2,
grouping of the risk score) but not chemotherapy. The first step demonstrated that tumor size (P = 0.004), lymph node
status (P = 0.002), PR (P = 0.035), and grouping of the risk score (P < 0.001) were significant independent factors for DFS.
Menopausal status (P = 0.070) and histological grade trended (P = 0.078) towards significance. In the second step, interactions
between usage of chemotherapy (general or paclitaxel-based) and grouping of the risk score were investigated along with
adjustments for those factors (with P < 0.10) identified in the first step. This table shows the results of the second step.

independent factors for DFS after multivariate adjustment.
In the second step, the interaction between risk score
groups and chemotherapy was investigated, along with
adjustment for the factors identified in the first step
(factors with P < 0.10). The risk score from the STMN1E/P/C model was not associated with response to general
adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.078). Paclitaxel, an antimicrotubule drug, has been widely used as an adjuvant
chemotherapy after surgery, and recent studies have
suggested that STMN1 overexpression is associated
with paclitaxel resistance [18]. We therefore selected
patients treated with paclitaxel to determine whether the
STMN1-E/P/C model could predict response to the drug.
The interaction between the risk score and paclitaxelbased chemotherapy strongly impacted DFS (P = 0.002;
Table 3). The interaction implies that high-risk patients
received only 28% (1/3.532, where 3.532 is the HR of
interaction between the risk score and paclitaxel-based
chemotherapy) of the benefit from adjuvant paclitaxelbased chemotherapy compared with low-risk patients.

We also sought to explore the possibility that differences
in phosphorylation status could prognose recurrence risk
in breast cancer patients. By analyzing two independent
patient cohorts, we showed and validated for the first time
that integrated STMN1 expression, phosphorylation status
and known clinicopathological characteristics of cancer
patients (shown here for breast cancer) can predict clinical
outcomes successfully, and exhibit a remarkable predictive
value to guide appropriate treatment.
In this study of breast cancer, STMN1 expression
and the phosphorylation status of its multiple serine
residues were better correlated with DFS than standard
clinicopathological features. Because the DFS differed
depending on the site of phosphorylation detected, we
expected that the combined data from the four sites
would have a higher prognostic value. We developed a
novel prognostic model based on STMN1 and its multiple
phospho-sites, in addition to several clinicopathological
factors, to improve the prognosis of recurrence after
surgery for breast cancer patients. We demonstrated that
this model can successfully categorize breast cancer
patients into high- and low-risk groups with significant
differences in DFS, especially for the luminal subtype.
Furthermore, this classifier can be utilized to predict
the therapeutic response to adjuvant paclitaxel-based
chemotherapy. Our findings are based on two independent
patient cohorts and indicate that this novel classifier may
be useful for managing patients with breast cancer and
identifying patients with higher risk for recurrence.
The TNM staging system has been used for
many years as a predictor for breast cancer recurrence.

DISCUSSION
STMN1 is a prognostic marker for various types of
cancer, such as breast and endometrial cancer [19, 20], and
has also been shown to be independent of other factors,
such as age, menopausal status, nodal status, nuclear
grade, tumor size, and ER, PR, and HER2 expression
[21]. We hypothesized that the cellular phosphorylation
levels of STMN1 at four serine residues, as determined by
immunohistochemistry, are related to DFS in breast cancer.

However, TNM staging has been gradually shown to
exhibit less sensitivity in predicting patient outcome
[22]. The recent discovery of aberrant expression levels
of various biomarkers, including microRNAs, longnoncoding RNAs, and proteins, in breast cancer tissue
or patients’ plasma has motivated the analysis of clinical
characteristics and biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis.
In this study, we suggest that the risk score based on
STMN1 and its multiple phospho-sites could be of
significantly better prognostic value than TNM staging.
The addition of some significant clinicopathological
factors, including histological grade, tumor size and
lymphatic metastasis, to the STMN1-E/P model enhanced the
prediction of DFS. Our report is the first in our knowledge to
identify the importance of the combination of STMN1 and its
multiple phosphorylations in breast cancer. Furthermore, the
IHC readouts in the lab plus the clinicopathological factors
could accurately predict the probability for breast cancer
recurrence, especially for luminal subtype.
Most breast cancer patients are of the luminal
subtype [23], with a long-term clinical course and
sensitivity to endocrine therapy [24]. However, high
probabilities of recurrence long after surgery (more
than 5 years) for the luminal subtypes remain a large
clinical problem for physicians. Our research establishes
the STMN1-E/P/C model as a better predictor of DFS
for patients with breast cancer, specifically the luminal
subtype. Although our results predicted no significant
differences, the time-dependent ROC curves still display
a trend towards a better prognostic value for the classifier
for longer DFS (Supplementary Figure S1). Further
research with longer follow-up times could strengthen the
prognostic model for the luminal subtype.
Paclitaxel is one of the most commonly used
chemotherapy agents for breast cancer [25] and is also
considered one of the most efficacious [26]. Paclitaxel
stabilizes microtubules, arresting mitosis [26]. STMN1 has
been reported to increase sensitivity to anti-microtubule
drugs. Overexpression of stathmin has been shown to
decrease polymerization of microtubules and markedly
decrease the binding of and sensitivity to paclitaxel but
not affect sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs that do not
target microtubules [27]. Its overexpression has also been
associated with paclitaxel resistance in other malignant
tumors, including cholangiocarcinoma, lung cancer and
ovarian cancer [18, 28, 29]. In the present study, we showed
that patients classified as high risk by the STMN1-E/P/C
model derive less benefit from paclitaxel; further use of this
classifier may better identify patients most likely to benefit
from adjuvant paclitaxel-based therapy. The STMN1-E/P/C
model is both prognostic and predictive for patients with
breast cancer, in that low risk patients have less likelihood
of metastasis and a clear benefit from paclitaxel.
In conclusion, we showed that STMN1 expression
and phosphorylation at multiple serine residues plus
clinicopathological characteristics have significant predictive
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

value for breast cancer-associated disease events including
recurrence. This model could improve the identification of
patients with luminal subtypes of breast cancer at the time of
primary diagnosis and predict their sensitivity to paclitaxel,
thereby enabling oncologists to target those likely to relapse
or metastasize for appropriate treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and clinical database
We studied 310 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue samples from 310 patients with histologically
confirmed stage I to III primary breast cancer who underwent
mastectomy in the Department of Breast Surgery in Fudan
University Shanghai Cancer Center. All specimens were
routinely fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin,
and the specimens were selected to represent all of the
histologic types of breast cancer. For the training set, data
were obtained from 204 patients between August 2001 and
March 2006 for whom clinicopathological characteristics and
follow-up information were available. The patients of this
training set were regularly followed up through September
2013, and the clinical outcomes of 183 cases were obtained
with a median follow-up of 102 months (0.5–144 months).
We added another 106 patients with the same entry criteria
between June 2007 and November 2011 as an independent
validation set. The clinical outcomes of 102 cases through
July 2014 were obtained with a median follow-up time
of 79 months (2–81 months). Patient information and
the clinicopathological characteristics of both cohorts
are presented in Table 1. This study was approved by the
independent ethical committee/institutional review board of
Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (Shanghai Cancer
Center Ethical Committee). All patients provided written
informed consent before their inclusion in this study.

Tissue microarray
To construct the tissue microarray (TMA), hematoxylin
and eosin (HE)-stained slides from tumors were evaluated to
identify representative tumor regions from which 2 1.0-mm
tissue cores were retrieved and transferred into recipient array
blocks using a tissue micro arrayer (UNITMA Instruments,
Seoul, Korea) as previously described [30, 31]. The TMA
was composed of duplicate cores from different areas of the
same tumor to compare staining patterns. TMA sections of 3
mm were subsequently dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in
ethanol for immunohistochemical staining.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry for STMN1, Ser16, Ser25,
Ser38 and Ser63 were conducted using a two-step protocol
(GTVision™III). Briefly, TMA sections were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after rehydration

P values are two-sided, and a P value of less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
For the predictive model, variables with P values
less than 0.2 with a univariate analysis of the training set
were used to construct the multivariate Cox proportional
hazards models. To estimate the utility of the prognostic
model, the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC)
for patient DFS was calculated. The time-dependent ROC
curve was used to illustrate the relationship between
the sensitivity and false-positive rate (1-specificity) We
calculated a risk score of each patient by the formula
and used time-dependent ROC analysis by R software
version 3.1.1 and the “survival ROC” package to assess
the prognostic accuracy of the score. Then we used
Youden index to choose the best cutoff score based on
the ROC curve.

and then treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to
block endogenous peroxidase activity. The antigens were
retrieved by boiling the five groups of TMAs in citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) at 100°C for 5 min for STMN1 and Ser38,
121°C for 10 min for Ser16 and Ser63, and 140°C for 25
min for Ser25. For STMN1 and Ser38, TMAs were blocked
with 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature
(RT) and incubated in a humid chamber at 4°C overnight
with polyclonal rabbit anti-human STMN1 antibody
(Proteintech) or polyclonal rabbit anti-human STMN1
Ser38 (Cell Signaling Technologies) antibody diluted to
1:400 or 1:100, respectively. For the other three markers,
TMAs were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human
STMN1 Ser16 antibody (Abcam), polyclonal rabbit antihuman STMN1 Ser25 antibody (Novus), and polyclonal
rabbit anti-human STMN1 Ser63 antibody (Abcam) diluted
to 1:50 in Bond Primary Diluent in a humid chamber at
40°C overnight. Following washes with PBS, all of the
TMAs were incubated for 30 min with secondary antibody
(GTVision™III Detection System/Mo&Rb) at RT. The
sections were then counterstained with Gill hematoxylin
and mounted after clearing with xylene. The negative
controls were a group of the same TMAs subjected to the
same procedures, excluding the primary antibodies.

Staining evaluation

GRANT SUPPORT

Immunostaining was independently reviewed
by two pathologists (TC and SJ) who were blinded
to patient characteristics and outcome. A staining
index (SI) was calculated according to the intensity
and percentage of positive cells. A semiquantitative
grading system incorporating staining intensity (0, no
staining; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong) and the
percentage of cells stained (0, no staining; 1, < 10%;
2, 10–50%; and 3, > 50% of tumor cells) was applied.
The SI was calculated by multiplying the results of
these two variables and ranged from 0 to 9 [32, 33]. If
heterogeneity was observed for the 2 cylinders of each
case, the SI was defined as positive or negative so that
one overall mean score was used. A cutoff representing
the upper quartile (SI > 4) was used to define high
levels of staining, whereas others were defined as
low levels of staining. The SI for each antibody was
evaluated using the same criteria.
