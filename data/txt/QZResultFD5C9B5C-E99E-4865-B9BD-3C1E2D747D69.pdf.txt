BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates have been used successfully in the treatment of hypercalcemia and to reduce skeletal complications of bone metastasis, but have not been shown to prevent bone metastasis or to prolong survival
time in metastatic breast cancer patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether the progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with bone-only breast cancer metastasis differed based on
whether patients received zoledronic acid, pamidronate, or no bisphosphonate upon diagnosis of their metastases.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 314 patients diagnosed with bone-only metastasis at the
time of initial staging or who developed bone metastasis as the first recurrence site during follow-up from January 1,
1997 to December 31, 2008, at The MD Anderson Cancer Center. Univariate and multivariate Cox hazards models
were used to assess the effects of each treatment on PFS and OS. RESULTS: Patients who had more than 1 bone metastasis and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 and 3 were more likely to receive
zoledronic acid in this analysis. Compared with no bisphosphonate use, the use of zoledronic acid was not significantly associated with longer PFS (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.72, P ¼ .058 in univariate analysis, and HR ¼ 0.80, P ¼ .235
in multivariate analysis) nor with longer OS (HR ¼ 1.04, P ¼ .863 in univariate analysis and HR ¼ 1.34, P ¼ .192 in multivariate analysis). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that for patients with bone-only metastases, zoledronic
acid did not prolong PFS or OS. In patients with bone-only metastasis, we could not demonstrate antitumor effects

INTRODUCTION
Bone is the most common site of metastatic spread (70% of patients) in advanced breast cancer.1 Bone-only metastatic
breast carcinoma, defined as metastatic disease limited to the bone at the time of initial diagnosis of metastasis, has been
reported to occur in 17% to 37% of women.2-4 Patients with bone-only metastases have long survival and substantial
numbers of skeletal-related events (SREs).4-9
Bisphosphonates have been used successfully in the treatment of hypercalcemia and to reduce skeletal complications
of bone metastasis.10-16 However, bisphosphonates have not been shown to prevent bone metastasis or to prolong survival
in breast cancer patients. Preclinical data in animal models have revealed direct and indirect antitumor effects of
bisphosphonates.14,17 For example, zoledronic acid suppressed bone, lung, and liver metastases in a murine model of
breast cancer.18 Zoledronic acid has been suggested to have synergistic antitumor effects with chemotherapy,19,20 to promote antiangiogenesis21 and apoptosis,22 and to have immunomodulatory effects.23
Based on this preclinical evidence and the potent antitumor effects of bisphosphonates in preclinical models, it
remains controversial whether bisphosphonates may confer a survival benefit.24-27 Zoledronic acid prolongs survival in
other metastatic diseases.28 Zoledronic acid is being investigated in the adjuvant setting to try to prevent metastasis and
prolong survival. Findings from the ABCSG-12 trial showed that zoledronic acid combined with endocrine therapy in the

adjuvant setting significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) beyond
that achieved with endocrine therapy alone.29 In the metastatic setting, pamidronate has not been shown to provide a survival benefit in previous studies.10-13,30
It is important to identify groups of breast cancer
patients who are most likely to benefit from bisphosphonate treatment. Patients with bone metastasis have different prognoses based on whether they also have visceral
metastases.3,4,6,8,9 Therefore we focused on bone-only
metastasis in this study.
We hypothesized that patients with bone-only metastasis treated with standard therapeutic agents plus zoledronic acid or pamidronate at the time of initial diagnosis
of metastases would survive longer than patients treated
with standard agents without zoledronic acid or pamidronate. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare
the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
(OS) time of patients with bone-only metastasis who
received zoledronic acid or pamidronate treatment with
those who did not.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We retrospectively identified patients diagnosed with
bone metastasis at the time of initial staging or who developed bone metastasis as the first recurrence site during
follow-up. Patients diagnosed from January 1, 1997 to
December 31, 2008, at The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center were included in this analysis,
and their records were retrieved from the Department of
Breast Medical Oncology prospectively maintained computerized database. Of the 2254 patients diagnosed with
bone metastasis with or without nonskeletal metastasis
from breast cancer, 756 (33.5%) were diagnosed with
bone-only metastasis. Patients were eligible for the study
if they had been treated in the Breast Medical Oncology
Department at The MD Anderson Cancer Center from
the time of bone metastasis diagnosis and had been followed up for more than 3 months. We excluded patients
who had another malignant tumor and patients who
received zoledronic acid or pamidronate more than 6
months after the diagnosis of bone metastasis. Of the 756
patients with bone-only metastasis, 442 were excluded
because the patients did not undergo follow-up at MD
Anderson (n ¼ 140), were lost to follow-up (n ¼ 42), had
treatment at another hospital before coming to our institution (n ¼ 208), received zoledronic acid or pamidronate

more than 6 months after the diagnosis of bone metastases
(n ¼ 43), and/or had another malignant tumor in addition to breast cancer (n ¼ 15). This retrospective study
was approved by the institutional review board at MD
Anderson.
Definition of Bone-only Metastasis and
Treatment Groups
We defined patients with bone-only metastasis as patients
with bone metastasis demonstrated by appropriate imaging and/or biopsy and without nonskeletal distant metastasis at the time of their initial diagnosis of metastatic
breast cancer. We defined ‘‘initial stage IV’’ as bone-only
metastasis detected at the time of the patient’s initial diagnosis of breast cancer, and we defined ‘‘secondary stage
IV’’ as bone-only metastasis detected after the completion
of definitive curative management of the primary breast
tumor (including neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant systemic
treatment). We defined single metastasis as 1 bone metastasis based on reports of bone scan and/or positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)
imaging, and multiple metastases as 2 or more metastatic
sites. We defined 3 groups of patients: patients who
received zoledronic acid within 6 months of diagnosis of
bone metastasis and continued more than 2 months (ZA),
patients who received pamidronate within 6 months of diagnosis of bone metastasis and continued more than 2
months (PA), and patients who did not receive bisphosphonates during clinical follow-up (no-ZA/PA). The reason
for the cutoff of 6 months was that some patients received
chemotherapy for 6 months and then received bisphosphonate. We categorized patients who were started on
pamidronate and changed to zoledronic acid as members
of the PA group.
Staging and Pathology Review
Primary breast cancer had been staged according to the
sixth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer’s AJCC Cancer Staging Manual.31
Metastatic bone disease had been confirmed by histopathologic analysis when available. Patients with multiple sites of suspected metastasis had undergone biopsy of
the metastatic lesion that had been considered most likely
to represent metastatic disease.
Grading of tumors was determined by dedicated
breast pathologists according to the modified Black’s nuclear grading system;32 histologic classification of tumors
had been done according to the World Health Organization criteria.33 A patient was considered to have human

epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease if the primary or metastatic tumor had a score of 3þ
by HER2 immunohistochemical staining or amplification
(ratio 2.2) of the HER2 gene by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.34 A patient was considered to have estrogen
receptor (ER)- or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive disease if there was at least 10% positive tumor staining.
Hormone receptor-positive disease was defined as ERand/or PR-positive disease.
Statistical Analysis
Means and standard deviations were used to summarize
age at diagnosis. Frequencies and proportions were used
to present the categorical clinical characteristics. Pearson
chi-square tests and Fisher exact tests were used to test
association of treatments and categorical clinical characteristics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine differences in mean age among patients in various
treatment groups. Progression was defined as demonstration of a new metastatic lesion. PFS was defined as the
time interval from diagnosis of metastasis to progression,
death, or last follow-up date, whichever occurred first.
Patients who were alive without progression at the last follow-up were censored in the PFS analyses. OS was defined
as the length of time from diagnosis of metastasis to death
or last follow-up date if patients were alive at the last follow-up. Patients who were alive at the last follow-up were
censored in the OS analyses. PFS and OS were estimated
by the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. KaplanMeier curves were used to present PFS and OS over time
for patients in each group. Univariate and multivariate
Cox proportional hazards (Cox PH) regression
models were used to assess the effect of treatment and
other predictive factors. The analyses were performed in
SAS 9.1 for Windows (Copyright ª 2002-2003 by SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patients
Table 1 shows the 314 evaluable patients and tumor characteristics classified by the treatments that patients
received at initial diagnosis of bone disease (ZA, PA, or
no-ZA/PA). The ZA group had a higher percentage of
patients with more than 1 bone metastasis compared with
the no-ZA/PA group or the PA group, and the ZA group
had a higher proportion with ECOG performance status
of 2 or 3 compared with the no-ZA/PA group or the PA
group. Among 314 patients with bone-only metastasis,

161 patients experienced disease progression before death,
101 patients experienced progression but were alive at last
follow-up, 3 patients died without progression, and 49
patients were alive without progression at the last followup. In 101 (32%) patients, metastatic disease was confirmed by histopathologic analysis. The median follow-up
time was 33 months.
In the PA group, a total of 77 patients received
pamidronate during initial treatment for bone metastases;
30 of these patients changed treatment for bone metastases to zoledronic acid. Pamidronate was used for a median

and pairwise comparisons. The overall tests showed that
none of the 3 treatment groups had significantly longer
PFS among all patients or among patients with hormone
receptor-positive disease (P ¼ .007 and P ¼ .014, respectively). Among patients with hormone receptor-positive
disease, the ZA group had longer PFS than the PA group
(hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 1.37, P ¼ .040). In patients with
hormone receptor-positive tumors, the no-ZA/PA group
had longer PFS than either the ZA group (HR ¼ 0.67, P
¼ .025) or the PA group (HR ¼ 0.49, P < .001). In all
patients, PFS was longer for the no-ZA/PA group than for
the PA group (HR ¼ 0.57, P ¼ .002). Figure 1A shows
the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS among all patients by

results for PFS. The use of zoledronic acid at the time of

DISCUSSION
We found that the use of zoledronic acid in bone-only
metastasis did not prolong OS when compared with the
use of pamidronate or no bisphosphonate in this group of
patients with bone-only metastatic breast cancer. The
same was true for each subgroup analyzed. The use of
zoledronic acid improved PFS when compared with the
use of pamidronate in hormone receptor-positive breast
cancer, but the PFS for patients who received the zoledronic acid was shorter than that of the patients with no
bisphosphonate use.
It is standard treatment for zoledronic acid to be
used to treat patients with bone-only metastatic disease to
delay or prevent SREs. However, its use has not been
shown to prolong survival.
It is possible to define groups of patients with
advanced breast cancer at different risks of complications
from skeletal disease. Patients with bone-only disease at
the time of diagnosis of skeletal metastases were almost 3
times more likely to develop pathological long-bone frac-

2044

tures than those with bone and liver disease.4 The previous study identified groups of patients most at risk of
these complications from skeletal metastatic disease. The
results might be used to select patients for treatment with
bisphosphonates and might improve the cost-benefit
analysis.4
It is still controversial whether bisphosphonates confer a survival benefit. Three trials using clodronate in the
adjuvant setting have been published. Two reported that
clodronate had beneficial effects on both bone metastasis
and survival.24-26 In contrast, the third trial reported that
clodronate had no effect on metastasis and a negative
effect on survival.27 Gnant et al29 showed that zoledronic
acid significantly improved PFS among premenopausal
women with early breast cancer. Recent results from the
neoadjuvant subgroup analysis of the AZURE trial35
showed a significant increase in pathological complete
responses in patients treated with zoledronic acid. On the
other hand, Aft et al36 reported that pathological complete
response rates were not significantly different between
treatment groups. The ZO-FAST study showed that
patients who received adjuvant letrozole plus immediate
zoledronic acid had a statistically significant 41% relative
reduction in the risk of DFS events when compared with
patients who received delayed zoledronic acid (log-rank P
¼ .0314).37 In the metastatic setting, pamidronate did
not provide a survival benefit compared with placebo
treatment.10-13 Rosen et al16 reported that the median
survival times were comparable between the pamidronate
and zoledronic acid groups. Park et al30 reported in a retrospective study that bisphosphonate treatment may provide a survival benefit in patients with metastatic breast
cancer, particularly patients with hormone receptor-negative tumors. However, in that study, only 27.5% of
patients in the bisphosphonate group received zoledronic
acid. The study lacked the power to confirm antitumor
effects of zoledronic acid in metastatic tumors. In our
study, zoledronic acid did not improve survival; the apparent negative impact of bisphosphonates on PFS when
compared with the no-ZA/PA group is likely the reflection
of better prognostic characteristics of the no-ZA/PA
group: more than 80% of patients in the ZA group had
multiple bone metastases, whereas only 57% had multiple
metastases in the bo-ZA/PA group, and the patients in the
no-ZA/PA group had better performance status. Based on
these data, zoledronic acid did not appear to have antitumor effects. The reasons for zoledronic acid not having
demonstrable antitumor effects in bone-only metastases
may include the biologic behavior of the metastatic

tumor, which may be fundamentally different from that
of primary breast cancers.
Recently investigators have reported markers that
may be effective in selecting patients who may benefit from
bisphosphonate treatment. N-telopeptide (NTX) and
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) levels have been
shown to correlate significantly with clinical outcomes,
including SREs, disease progression, and death.38,39 Therefore, among cancer patients with bone metastases and elevated NTX levels, normalization of NTX may have
prognostic value for the clinical benefit of zoledronic acid
treatment.40 Aft et al36 reported that fewer women had detectable disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent zoledronic acid than
did women who had chemotherapy alone, and zoledronic
acid appeared to decrease the rate at which DTC-negative
breast cancer patients developed subsequent micrometastatic disease at 3 months. We tried to find a subgroup that
benefits from zoledronic acid treatment. Zoledronic acid
improved PFS better than pamidronate among patients
with hormone receptor-positive tumors. However, in all

subgroups, the ZA group did not have prolonged survival
when compared with the no-ZA/PA group.
Our study has some limitations. First, this study
was a retrospective evaluation. Our data were collected
from patients’ charts; therefore, this study suffers from
the biases associated with any retrospective study,
including selection bias. Patients were given zoledronic
acid based on the clinical decision to try to delay or prevent skeletal-related complications. The no-ZA/PA
group included a higher percentage of patients with single bone metastases and good performance status than
did the ZA and PA groups. Therefore, the no-ZA/PA
group included many more patients who had long survival durations.
In the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting, zoledronic
acid showed antitumor effects.29,41 However, our results
may not support the hypothesis that zoledronic acid has
antitumor effects in metastatic tumors. Zoledronic acid
might prevent bone micrometastases but not have an
effect on macrometastasis of bone disease. Based on our
results, it is possible that if zoledronic acid is to have

optimal effects in treating breast cancer, it should be given
before metastases are extant.
In summary, at present, the use of zoledronic acid for
patients with bone metastases is the gold standard because it
significantly reduces or prevents skeletal-related events.
However, in patients with bone-only metastases, we did not
demonstrate an antitumor effect (prolonged PFS or OS) of
zoledronic acid in this retrospective study. The potential
antitumor effect of zoledronic acid remains controversial.
Patients and physicians should have a clear understanding
of the potential benefits of bisphosphonate treatment.
