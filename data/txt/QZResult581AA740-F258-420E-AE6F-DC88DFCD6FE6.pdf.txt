ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) drug resistance (DR) is a multistep transformation
process based on a powerful interplay between bone marrow stromal cells and MM
cells that allows the latter to escape anti-myeloma therapies. Here we present an
overview of the role of the bone marrow microenvironment in both soluble factorsmediated drug resistance (SFM-DR) and cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAMDR), focusing on the role of new players, namely miRNAs, exosomes and cancerassociated fibroblasts.

DRUG RESISTANCE

resistant phenotype. Acquired resistance depends on
multifactorial processes, namely decreased drug uptake,
expression of new drug-efflux pumps, drug metabolism,
repair of DNA damage, alterations of cell proliferation
and/or apoptosis [4]. It is usually studied in vitro via
prolonged exposure of cells to a cytotoxic agent until the
drug resistant phenotype is acquired. De novo resistance is
present before the drug exposure and then selected during
the drug treatment [3]. Recent studies have demonstrated,
by inter-phase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH)
[5] and flow cytometry [6], the heterogeneity of MM cells
at genetic (chromosome number, genetic translocations
and mutations), clonal and cell differentiation levels. In
particular, flow cytometry analysis reveals the presence
of multiple cell clones in patients at diagnosis that are
selected by in vivo therapeutic pressure and induce a
distinct phenotypic MM cell subclone with different
clonogenic and cytogenetic profiles in minimal residual
disease [6]. A form of de novo resistance is environmentmediated drug resistance (EMDR), in which the BMME
protects tumor cells from chemotherapy, radiotherapy or
receptor-targeting drugs [7]. Overall, these observations
highlight that MM progression and drug resistance are
multistep transformation processes regulated by a complex
cross-talk between MM cells and the BMME.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most
common hematologic malignancy characterized by the
infiltration of monoclonal malignant plasma cells (MM
cells) at multiple sites within the bone marrow (BM)
compartment [1]. The pathophysiology of MM depends
both on several oncogenic events occurring in MM cells,
i.e. genomic/chromosomal instability, gene mutations and
chromosomal translocations, and on extracellular factors,
i.e. dynamic interactions between MM cells and the BM
microenvironment (BMME) in a reciprocal pro-survival
loop [1]. Despite the significantly improved response
rate and overall survival of MM patients since the
advent of novel agents such as bortezomib, thalidomide,
lenalidomide, and autologous stem cell transplantation,
MM remains an incurable malignancy with a 5-years
survival rate of around 40% [2]. Indeed, the majority
of patients relapse or become refractory to therapies,
implying that drug resistance (DR) prevents effective
treatment of MM.
Resistance to chemotherapy can be acquired or
de novo DR [3]. Acquired resistance develops gradually
as a result of sequential genetic and epigenetic changes
that ultimately confer the tumor cells a complex drugwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in the endosteum, at the interface between trabecular
bone and BM, and regulates hematopoietic stem cell
quiescence and self-renewal, hence hematopoiesis.
The blood vessel-rich vascular niche controls stem cell
mobilization, proliferation and differentiation [9]. The
osteoblast and vascular niches are adjacent and show a
mutually related secretion of several cytokines/growth
factors and/or expression of adhesion molecules, creating
a permissive microenvironment in the BM, namely
“MM niches” [9]. MM cells home to and reside in these
niches where they are protected from apoptotic stimuli
and acquire the DR phenotype. In the niches, MM cells
suppress osteoblastic cells, leading to impaired bone
formation and the development of osteolytic lesions, and
enhance angiogenesis via angiogenic factors secreted by
MM cells, ECs, and BM stromal cells, thus promoting
disease progression. The inability of conventional anticancer drugs to cure MM has reinforced EMDR. During
chemotherapy, the interactions of a small subset of tumor
cells with the BMME allow them to survive in a quiescent
and protected state, resulting in minimal residual disease

THE BMME AS A NICHE FOR MM CELLS
The BMME includes a non-cellular compartment
formed by extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (laminin,
fibronectin and collagen) and soluble factors (cytokines,
growth factors, chemokines), and a rich cellular
compartment constituted by hematopoietic cells (myeloid
cells, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, NK cells) and nonhematopoietic cells (fibroblasts, osteoblasts, osteoclasts,
endothelial cells (ECs), endothelial progenitor cells
(EPCs), pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells, mesenchymal
stromal cells) (Figure 1). All these cells form specialized
microenvironment niches, the osteoblast/endosteal and
vascular niches, that play a key role in MM cell growth,
survival and DR [8]. The osteoblast niche is located

Figure 1: Interplay between MM cells and the surrounding microenvironment. MM cells are surrounded by a complex
BMME composed of ECM proteins and several cell types, including BM stromal cells (ECs, mesenchymal stromal cells, CAFs). The crosstalk between MM cells and BM stromal cells is regulated by different mechanisms: (i) cell-to-cell adhesion between MM cells and ECM
components/BM stromal cells; and (ii) soluble factors, i.e. cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, exosomes and miRNAs released by the
BM stromal cells and MM cells, with autocrine and paracrine effects. Both mechanisms activate several signaling pathways in BM stromal
cells and tumor cells, leading to MM drug resistance.

that progressively develops the acquired-resistance
phenotype [10]. Using intravital two-photon microscopy
in live mice, Lawson et al. [11] demonstrated that a small
subpopulation of MM cells colonizes BM sites close to
collagen-expressing osteoblasts or bone-lining cells,
and falls into a dormant state by down-regulating the
expression of genes that govern the cell cycle. Dormant
MM cells are resistant to melphalan; however, cells may
be activated by microenvironmental signals that can switch
cancer cell dormancy “on” or “off”. McMillin et al. [12]
developed a tumor cell-specific in vitro bioluminescence
imaging assay that analyzes the effect of drugs on tumor
cell viability in the presence and absence of BM stromal
cells. They identified a stroma-induced signature in tumor
cells, including AKT, Ras, NF-kB, HIF-1α, Myc, hTert
and IRF4 signaling pathways, which is correlated with an
adverse clinical prognosis.
EMDR can be subdivided into: i) soluble factorsmediated resistance (SFM-DR), which relies on cytokines,
chemokines and growth factors, and ii) cell adhesionmediated resistance (CAM-DR) resulting from adhesion
of tumor cells to BM stromal cells or to ECM components.

cells, that increases the expression of adhesion molecules,
stimulating IL-6 secretion by BM stromal cells [18]. All
these data emphasize the key role of IL-6 in MM and
explain why IL-1β and IL-6 may be useful targets in
MM treatment [18]. However, several in vitro preclinical
studies targeting the IL-6 signaling pathway, including
antibodies against IL-6 and IL-6 receptors (CNTO328),
IL-6 antisense oligonucleotides and IL-6 super antagonist
Sant7, were unsuccessful due to autocrine IL-6 production,
and/or activation of the IL-6/STAT3 and NF-κB pathways
following MM cells-BM stromal cells interactions [19].
IL-6, in turn, enhances the secretion of VEGF, the
most important angiogenic factor [20]. Angiogenesis is a
constant hallmark in MM progression, and correlates with
tumor growth, relapse and DR [21]. It is regulated by a
balance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic molecules
but this is lost in the angiogenic switch [20] that occurs
during MM progression. The levels of VEGF, produced
by both MM cells and BM stromal cells, increase during
MM progression. FGF-2, TGF-β, and TNFα also stimulate
its secretion [22]. By binding with its receptors, VEGF-R1
and VEGF-R2, VEGF stimulates vascular permeability,
ECs proliferation, migration, invasion into surrounding
tissue, and whole capillary tube formation [23]. It also
governs the differentiation and survival of BM stromal
cells [22]. Antivascular and antiangiogenic agents,
including bortezomib and thalidomide, have cytotoxic
effects on MM cells and ECs by inhibiting the secretion
of multiple angiogenic factors including VEGF, HGF and
FGF-2 [24, 25].
HGF is upregulated during MM progression. It
enhances the expression of its receptor, cMET, and of
other angiogenic factors, including VEGF and FGF2, and suppresses the secretion of thrombospondin 1,
an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor [26]. The HGF/
cMET pathway is involved in the MM pathogenesis: it
is constitutively activated in MM cells [27] and ECs [28]
from relapsed and resistant patients, and mediates DR [27,
28]. In ECs, the HGF/cMET loop enhances the expression
of VEGF-A/VEGF-R2, sustaining MM angiogenesis [27].
In vitro and in vivo studies of a novel selective cMET
inhibitor, SU11274, tested alone or in combination with
bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone, suggest
that the HGF/cMET pathway may be envisaged as a new
therapeutic target for relapsed and refractory MM patients
[28].
IGF-1 is produced by both MM cells and BM
stromal cells, and contributes to MM pathobiology,
inducing MM cell growth, survival, migration, MMassociated angiogenesis and osteolysis [29]. By binding
its receptor, IGF-1R, it activates the PI3K/Akt and MEK/
ERK signaling pathways, that induce overexpression
of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and
downregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim [29,
30]. IGF-1R is overexpressed on MM cells: this aberrant
expression associated with high IGF-1 levels has been

SOLUBLE FACTORS-MEDIATED DRUG
RESISTANCE
The BMME contains soluble factors secreted by
BM stromal cells or MM cells themselves, that play a
multifaceted role in both MM onset and progression, and
the development of DR. Since soluble factors can act on
several cell targets, they regulate multiple processes such
as cell growth and apoptosis, cell migration, adhesion, and
angiogenesis. Notably, soluble factors cooperate among
themselves through a complex communication network,
creating the permissive BM niche.
The most important growth and survival factor is
IL-6. It is secreted by both BM stromal cells and MM cells
and inhibits MM apoptosis induced by serum starvation,
dexamethasone and Fas ligand [13, 14]. Autocrine IL-6
production is associated with a malignant MM cells
phenotype, i.e. a high proliferative index and resistance to
dexamethasone-induced apoptosis [15]. By binding with
its receptor, IL-6 triggers activation of the RAS/Raf/MEK/
MAPK, JAK/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways
[16]. Activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway protects
tumor cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis by upregulating
the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-XL and c-Myc. The
IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway is tightly controlled by the
SOCS-1 protein, a negative regulator of cytokine signaling
that is frequently inactivated by hypermethylation in MM
patients, resulting in an uncontrolled IL-6 signaling [17].
Secretion of IL-6 by BM stromal cells is up-regulated by
many molecules/cytokines (IL-1β, CD40, TNF-α, VEGF,
TGF-β) and by MM cell adhesion via activation of the
NF-kB pathway [8]. A major cytokine responsible for
paracrine IL-6 production is the IL-1β secreted by MM

related to disease progression and poor prognosis [29,
31]. In vitro and in vivo studies show that an increased
expression and activation of the IGF-1/IGF-1R pathway
in MM cells is associated with resistance to bortezomib
[32]. Based on these observations, several therapeutic
agents targeting the IGF-1/IGF-1R pathway have been
developed and analyzed in preclinical studies [29]. Menu
et al. [33, 34] demonstrated that picropodophyllin, a
non-ATP-competitive IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
inhibits tumor growth [33], MM-associated angiogenesis
and bone disease [34] in 5T33MM-treated mice.
Another important soluble factor is IL-8 (CXCL8),
a pro-inflammatory and angiogenic chemokine mainly
secreted by BM stromal cells [35]. It contributes to tumor
progression by inducing tumor cell proliferation, survival,
migration and angiogenesis through the phosphorylation of
VEGF-R2 [36, 37]. In vitro studies demonstrate that IL-8
contributes to BM stromal cells-induced NF-κB activity
in MM cells and the consequent resistance to bortezomib
[38].
Finally, the stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1)/
CXCR4 axis plays an important role in cell trafficking
within the BM, favoring the formation of pro-metastatic
BM niches and DR [39, 40]. SDF-1 (CXCL12) is
constitutively expressed and released by BM stromal cells
and fibroblasts, while its receptor CXCR4 is expressed by
MM cells and ECs [40]. Activation of the SDF-1/CXCR4
axis promotes trans-endothelial migration, BM homing,
migration and adhesion of MM cells. BM stromal cellsMM cells adhesion up-regulates SDF-1 secretion that, in
turn, increases integrins expression and IL-6 and VEGF
secretion, supporting MM cell growth and DR [41]. Using
an in vivo murine xenografted mouse model, Roccaro
et al. [42, 43] demonstrated that CXCR4 blockade
by the monoclonal antibody Ulocuplumab, as well as
neutralization of SDF-1 by Olaptesed-pegol (PEGylated
mirror-image l-oligonucleotide) inhibits MM bone-tobone cell dissemination and hence tumor progression.

described, for the first time, CAM-DR as a reversible DR
phenotype in fibronectin-adherent MM cells. The adhesive
interactions between MM cells and BM stromal cells are
complex because they involve several adhesion molecules
expressed on both MM cells and BM stromal cells [48,
50-54]. MM cells-BM stromal cells adhesion triggers IL-6
secretion, NF-κB activation in stromal cells [51] and the
up-regulation of many signaling pathways resulting in
MM cell proliferation and survival [55].
Several studies [49, 51, 55, 56] have described
CAM-DR to doxorubicin, melphalan, vincristine,
dexamethasone and mitoxantrone in MM cell lines
and patients primary MM cells due to their adhesion
to fibronectin or BM stromal cells. Inhibition of cell
adhesive interactions by shRNA-mediated knockdown of
the α4 subunit of VLA-4 (CD49d) or by anti-α4 antibodies
reverses CAM-DR, sensitizing MM cells to drug therapy
[56]. VLA-4 is strongly expressed on MM cells and is
the only integrin able to mediate both MM cell-ECM
and MM cell-BM stromal cells interactions via separate
binding sites [57]. Bortezomib overcomes CAM-DR
to vincristine and dexamethasone by down-regulating
VLA-4 expression on MM cells, thus inhibiting MM
cell adhesion to fibronectin and BM stromal cells [56].
Other integrins involved in CAM-DR are VLA-5 and β7:
the former supports cells survival by up-regulating Bcl-2
expression [58], the latter increases MM cells adhesion,
migration, and homing into BM, and reduces bortezomiband melphalan-induced apoptosis [46]. Moreover, β1integrin-mediated CAM-DR protects cells from cell
cycle-dependent drug therapies, such as the topoisomerase
inhibitor etoposide, by up-regulating p27kip1 and halting
the cell cycle [45]. In line with these observations, Paiva
et al. [59] demonstrated that MM cells in minimal residual
disease show an overexpression of integrins and adhesion
molecules even compared to the cells at first diagnosis.
MM cells-BM stromal cells interactions are also
mediated by Notch [60]. Binding of Notch receptors on
MM cells with the specific ligands on BM stromal cells
confers mitoxantrone and melphalan resistance. Indeed,
Notch activation results in an increasing secretion of IL-6,
IGF-1, and VEGF that, as previously described, contribute
to create a permissive BMME [8]. Finally, a relevant
consequence of MM cells-BM stromal cells adhesion
is the IL-6 mediated up-regulation of PD-L1 (CD274
or B7-H1) expression on MM cells, that increases their
proliferative ability, induces resistance to dexamethasone
and melphalan, and down-regulates anti-tumor immune T
cell responses [61].
All these findings demonstrate that CAM-DR
influences the therapeutic response and suggest the
importance of introducing anti-adhesion strategies in
combination with chemotherapeutic drugs. Podar et al.
[62] evaluated the effect of Natalizumab, a selective
adhesion-molecule inhibitor, which binds α4 integrins

CELL ADHESION-MEDIATED DRUG
RESISTANCE
CAM-DR is a mechanism whereby MM cells
escape the cytotoxic effects of anti-cancer therapy via
adhesive interactions with BM stromal cells and/or ECM
components. It is achieved through adhesion molecules
of the integrin family [44-51], CD138 (syndecan-1)
[44], CD44 [44, 50], Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1
(VCAM-1) [52], Lymphocyte Function-Associated
Antigen-1 (LFA-1) [48, 50, 53], Mucin-1 antigen (MUC1) [54], and Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1)
[48, 50, 53, 54]. Among the integrins, major fibronectin
receptors include the Very Late Activation Antigen (VLA)4 (α4β1), VLA-5 (α5β1), αvβ3 and β7 integrins, that mediate
MM cell trafficking and DR [44]. Damiano et al. [49]

and prevents MM cells interactions with ECM and BM
stromal cells. They observed that Natalizumab inhibits
MM cell proliferation, VEGF secretion and angiogenesis
and enhances the anti-MM activity of bortezomib and
dexamethasone, supporting the hypothesis that antiadhesion treatment could improve the current therapeutic
strategies for MM.

and therefore inhibit protein translation, regulating a wide
range of physiologic and pathologic cellular processes
such as proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, aging
and cell death [63, 64]. Deregulation of miRNAs has been
described in various tumors including MM, where they
can function either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes [65,
66].
In MM, a deregulated miRNAs expression in
tumor cells has been associated to disease progression,
pathobiology and DR, through modulating the expression
of target genes involved in several pathways, such as p53,
IGF-1/IGF-1R, VEGF/VEGF-R, NF-κB, IL-6-STAT3,
SOCS1 [67-71]. In particular, miRNAs deregulation is
correlated with MM clinical stages and/or MM molecular
subtypes [67-70]. Over-expression of miR-21, -106b~25
cluster, -181a/b has been observed in MM and MGUS
cells compared to healthy plasma cells, while a selective
upregulation of miR-32 and -17~92 cluster has been
demonstrated in MM cells and cell lines but not in MGUS
cells [67]. Lionetti et al. [70], in an integrated analysis
of miRNAs expression with genome-wide copy number
variations and heterozygosity, noticed a strong correlation
between miRNAs expression and IGH translocation and
heterozygosity. Seckinger et al. [71] investigated miRNAs

tumor growth by influencing cell proliferation, migration
and apoptosis. In addition, it targets the TNFα-induced
protein 3 (TNFAIP3) and activates the NF-κB pathways
[87] suggesting that it may cause an aberrant NF-κB
activation in bortezomib-resistant MM cells. miR-125a5p reduces the expression of p53-responsive miR-192
and -194, which enhance cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
Based on these observations, Leotta et al. [83] suggested
the combined use of miR-125 inhibitors and miR-192
and -194 mimics to treat MM. miR-21 promotes MM
cell growth and viability. It is up-regulated following
MM-BM stromal cells adhesion via the IL-6/STAT3 [84,
85] and NF-κB [86] pathways. MM cells overexpressing
miR-21 are resistant to dexamethasone- and doxorubicininduced apoptosis, and demonstrate a central role of
miR-21 in CAM-DR. Targeting miR-21 inhibits MM cell
growth, counteracting the protective effect of BM stromal
cells and, in combination with dexamethasone and/or
doxorubicin, synergistically triggers MM cell apoptosis
[86].
miRNAs are secreted in biological fluids (e.g.
plasma, serum, saliva, urine) [88] as nuclease resistant
entities, packaged with RNA-binding proteins [89] or
contained in microvesicles as exosomes (detailed below).
Circulating miRNAs are fully functional and able to
act as signaling molecules inside the recipient cells by
modulating the expression of their target genes. Increasing
evidence suggests that miRNAs could be diagnostic and
prognostic markers in human tumors, including MM [90,
91]. Rocci et al. [91] analyzed the serum miRNAs levels
of a large cohort of newly diagnosed MM patients and
correlated the miRNAs levels with the clinical outcome to
test their prognostic relevance. Among 800 miRNAs, they
identified two circulating miR-16 and -25 whose serum
levels were associated with overall survival. Nevertheless,
they did not observe a correlation between miRNAs serum
levels and miRNAs expression in MM cells, implying that
circulating miRNAs do not resemble the miRNAs profile
of tumor cells in the BM. Different results were illustrated
by other authors [92-94]. Wang et al. [92] demonstrated
a miRNAs signature in the extracellular BMME of MM
patients that mirrored serum and plasma circulating
miRNAs. A low expression of miR-let-7a, -15a and -106b
was observed in the BMME and MM cells. Kubiczkova et
al. [93] identified 5 circulating miRNAs (miR-34a, -130a,
-744, let-7d, let-7e) that were differentially expressed in
MM and MGUS serum compared to healthy subjects. The
miR-744 and let-7e levels were correlated with overall
survival. Navarro et al. [94] described a serum miRNAs
signature (miR-16, -17, -19b, -20a and -660) as a potential
diagnostic and prognostic tool in MM. Low levels of
both miR-19b and -331 were shown to be a marker of
short progression-free survival after autologous stem-cell
transplantation.
Further studies of circulating miRNAs in MM are
needed to elucidate their cell origin (cancer or normal, live

expression in 92 purified MM and MGUS cells and
normal plasma cells using miChip-array, that analyzes 559
human miRNAs. Compared to normal plasma cells, MM
cells showed 67 differentially expressed miRNAs, and
MGUS cells 20. The authors found no correlation between
miRNAs expression and MM molecular classifications.
On the contrary, a deregulated expression of miR-135a,
-135b, -200a, -200b and -596 was related with overall
survival.
Emerging evidence relates miRNAs expression with
anti-cancer drug activity or DR [69, 72]. The expression
of miR-27a is associated with bortezomib resistance in
MM patients [73]. Bortezomib treatment of MM cell lines
significantly decreases the expression of miR-27a, whose
gene target is the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a
major modulator of bortezomib sensitivity. These findings
are in agreement with previous data [74] that demonstrate
an increased bortezomib sensitivity of MM cell lines and
patients tumor cells by down-regulating CDK5. miR-29
acts as tumor suppressor miRNA in several hematological
malignancies [75]. It is down-regulated in patients MM
cells [76, 77] and in MM cell lines with acquired resistance
to bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib [78]. Amodio et
al. [76] described a miR-29b-Sp1 loop that explains the
role of miR-29b in bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Indeed,
Sp1, a transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle
and apoptosis-related genes, whose expression is in turn
governed by 26S proteasome [79], negatively regulates
miR-29b expression. Bortezomib treatment up-regulates
miR-29b levels through a down-regulation of Sp1,
enhancing drug-induced apoptosis in patients MM cells
and in MM cell lines. Enforced expression of miR-29b in
MM cells enhances bortezomib-induced apoptosis through
the reduction of proteasome activator PA200 levels [78].
Since the BMME plays a central role in determining
MM progression and DR [7], the involvement of miRNAs
in the cross-talk between the BMME and MM cells has
been investigated. Roccaro et al. [80] described a MMspecific miRNAs signature in relapsed/refractory MM
cells compared to their normal counterpart, characterized
by a down-expression or the absence of miRs-15a and -16.
MM-BM stromal cells interactions decrease miRs-15a and
-16 expression in MM cells, inducing cell survival and
IL-6-mediated bortezomib resistance [81, 82]. Enforced
expression of pre-miRs-15a and -16 inhibits MM-BM
stromal cells adhesion and MM cell proliferation, by
inhibiting AKT3, ribosomal-protein-S6, MAP-kinases,
NF-κB-activator MAP3KIP3, as well as limiting
angiogenesis by decreasing VEGF secretion [80].
Adhesion of MM cells to BM stromal cells upregulates miR-125a-5p [83] and -21 [84-86] levels in
tumor cells. An increased expression of miR125a-5p in
MM cells is associated to a subset of MM patients carrying
the t(4;14) translocation [70]. Enforced expression of miR125a mimics can downregulate the p53 pathway-related
genes, i.e. TP53, BAX, MDM2, CDKN1A, leading to

inducible nitric oxide synthase [102]. In turn, BM stromal
cells-exosomes modulate the proliferation, survival,
migration and bortezomib resistance of MM cells
[103]. These effects are related to the exosome proteins
content, activating several survival pathways, including
c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, p53, AKT, and inhibiting
MM cells bortezomib-induced apoptosis through the
modulation of Bcl-2, caspase-9, -3 and PARP expression
[103].
The exosome secretion, content and functionality
depend on the tumor BMME and tumor phenotype. Umezu
et al. [104] demonstrated that MM cells under hypoxia
conditions produce more exosomes than the parental
cells under normoxia, and that their content and function
are different. Exosomes derived from hypoxic MM cells
contain miR-135b whose target gene is the hypoxiainducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) subunit inhibitor (FIH1). Transfer of exosomal miR-135b to ECs reduces the
expression of FIH-1 and increases HIF-1 transcriptional
activity, accelerating angiogenesis both in vitro and in
vivo. These observations may explain the HIF-1α protein
expression and stabilization described in BM ECs from
patients with relapsed/refractory MM [105].
Finally, higher exosomes levels have been observed
in body fluids of cancer patients compared to healthy
subjects, suggesting that exosomes could be used as
biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of several
tumors including MM [106-109].

Exosomes are small membranous vesicles (40100 nm) released in the extracellular milieu by several
cell types [95-97] in physiological and pathological
conditions. They mediate local and systemic cell-to-cell
communication and regulate cell behavior by transferring
mRNA, miRNAs and proteins, through fusion with
the cell membrane or through endocytosis followed by
internalization of recipient cells [98]. In the MM context,
the exosomes-MM cells interaction is mediated by
fibronectin binding to heparan sulfate, expressed on the
surface of both exosomes and MM cells [99]. This binding
activates p38 and pERK signaling and the expression of
the downstream target genes DKK1 and MMP-9, and
promotes MM progression by inducing tumor cell spread
and ECs invasion [100]. The disruption of fibronectinheparan sulfate interactions blocks exosome binding to
MM cells or BM stromal cells, highlighting a specific
cross-talk fostered by exosomes in the BMME [100]. The
involvement of exosomes released by MM cells and BM
stromal cells, as an active vehicle that can modulate the
microenvironment and promote tumor progression and
DR, has been investigated by in vitro and in vivo studies
[101-103]. Exosomes derived from BM mesenchymal
stromal cells of MM patients show a different functional
activity compared to that of normal donors: the former
facilitate MM progression and spread whereas the latter
inhibit MM cell growth. Tissue-engineered bones loaded
with MM cells alone, as control, and in the presence of
either MM or normal BM-mesenchymal stromal cellsderived exosomes, were subcutaneously injected into
SCID mice. Bioluminescence in vivo imaging showed a
significantly higher tumor growth rate in mice transplanted
with MM BM-mesenchymal stromal cells-derived
exosomes than in those transplanted with normal BMMSC-derived exosomes. Using in vivo confocal imaging,
a higher ability of MM BM-mesenchymal stromal cellsderived exosomes to disseminate to the distant BM niches
in vivo was demonstrated. These effects were related to
a protein cargo of MM BM stromal cells-exosomes, i.e.
high levels of IL-6, CCL2, γ-catenin, fibronectin, and
to the absence of the tumor suppressor miR-15a [101].
The in vivo involvement of exosomes in the MM cells/
BM stromal cells cross-talk has been demonstrated
in the murine syngeneic 5T33MM model [102, 103].
Tumor exosomes contain multiple angiogenesis-related
proteins, such as angiogenin, HGF, MMP-9, serpin E1,
tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidase-1, thrombospondin 1
and VEGF, that promote ECs growth and angiogenesis.
Furthermore, MM cells exosomes induce the growth
of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and enhance their
immunosuppressive capacity in vivo by up-regulating

CANCER-ASSOCIATED FIBROBLASTS
CAFs are the most populous cell type within the
tumor microenvironment of many solid [110, 111] and
hematological malignancies [112]. In MM patients BM,
the CAFs population increases, and parallels the clinical
stages [113]. According to literature [114], the BM CAFs
exhibit phenotypic similarities to myofibroblasts or
activated fibroblasts. They are CD45- cells expressing
α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibroblast-specific
protein-1 (FSP-1), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and
other markers as platelet-derived growth factor receptor
α and β (PDGFR α/β), neuron-glial antigen2 (NG2),
CD31, CD144, VEGF-R2, CD33, CD146 and CD90 that
are specific for different cell types. This suggests that
CAFs may derive from multiple cell lineages: resident
fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, via the mesenchymal
transition [115], ECs and hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells, via the endothelial-mesenchymal
transition [116].
In vitro and in vivo experiments highlight a mutual
interplay between CAFs and tumor cells during MM onset
and progression. MM cells induce and maintain the CAFsactivated phenotype, their proliferation and recruitment
via TGF-β [113]. CAFs, in turn, modify the BM stroma
and influence chemotaxis, adhesion, proliferation, and
apoptosis of MM cells through cell-to-cell contact

involving β3, β7, VLA-4, VLA-5 and αVβ3 integrins
expressed on MM cells and β3 and β7 integrins expressed
on CAFs, and the secretion of TGF-β, HGF, IGF-1, IL-1,
IL-6 and SDF-1α by both cell types [113].
Recently, we demonstrated that BM CAFs from
bortezomib-resistant patients are resistant in vitro to the
drug and prevent the bortezomib-induced apoptosis of
co-cultured MM cells [117]. This protection depends on
the ability of bortezomib to foster bortezomib-resistant
CAFs to secrete several anti-apoptotic cytokine/growth
factors (as previously described), such as IGF-1, IL-6, IL8, TGF-β, and exosomes. Preliminary data demonstrate a

release of exosomes from bortezomib-treated CAFs that
are swallowed by MM cells (Figure 2), thus preventing
their bortezomib-induced apoptosis (unpublished data).
Proteomic and phospho-proteomic analyses reveal
that the bortezomib-DR of MM CAFs is associated to
cellular stress and activation of pro-survival autophagy
mediated by the autocrine TGF-β pathway [117]. Indeed,
blockade of the TGF-β pathway by a TβR-I/II inhibitor
induces apoptosis of bortezomib-resistant CAFs, by
inhibiting the Smad2/3 and autophagy signaling pathways,
and overcomes bortezomib resistance of MM cells
conferred by CAFs [117]. Therefore, CAFs are emerging

as a novel potentially therapeutic target in MM by means
of various strategies [112, 118] that act on both MM cells
and CAFs or on CAFs alone. In particular, Öhlund et al.
[118] identified four possible strategies to target the protumorigenic effects of CAFs. These strategies include
targeting the stromal barrier in order to increase the
drugs delivery; the inhibition of CAFs-secreted factors
that promote tumor progression and DR; the depletion or
blockage of the ECM components and/or integrins, and,
finally, the targeting of CAFs by deactivating the CAFs
phenotype to that of quiescent, normal fibroblasts.

CONCLUSIONS

Annu Rev Med. 2002; 53:615-27.

A large volume of research in MM has highlighted
the cardinal role of the BMME as a complex signaling
molecules network, in which MM onset, progression
and DR are regulated by a contact-dependent and
-independent interplay between MM cells and their
surrounding microenvironment. The role of the BMME
network has been seen to be more complex since the
discovery of the new players, miRNAs, exosomes and
CAFs. The therapeutic failure of novel MM agents (first
and second generation proteasome inhibitors, IMIDs, etc.)
that target cell adhesion, cytokines secretion and survival
pathways may be explained by their involvement. Notably,
CAFs, miRNAs deregulation and/or the exosomes cargo
(miRNAs/cytokines/proteins) could permit MM cells to
achieve apoptotic escape and/or prosurvival autophagy by
modulating alternative signaling pathways. Nevertheless,
in-depth investigations are needed to better elucidate the
role of miRNAs, exosomes and CAFs in affecting a tumorprone BM niche.
In conclusion, MM drug resistance, being a
multistep transformation process in which several players
cooperate among themselves, provides the rationale for
a multiple targets therapeutic approach with the aim of
creating an unsupportive BMME and thereby enabling
anti-MM therapies.
