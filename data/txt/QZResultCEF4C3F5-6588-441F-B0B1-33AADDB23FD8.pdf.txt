Abstract
Overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD),
when combined with certain chemicals that inhibit peroxide
removal, increases cancer cell cytotoxicity. Elevating MnSOD
levels in cells enhances the conversion of superoxide (O.2) to
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), combined with inhibiting the
removal of H2O2, further increases H2O2 levels, leading to
increased cytotoxicity. We hypothesized that increasing endogenous O.2 production in cells that were pretreated with
adenoviral MnSOD (AdMnSOD) plus 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1nitrosourea (BCNU) would lead to an increased level of
intracellular H2O2 accumulation and increased cell killing.
The cytotoxic effects of Adriamycin or radiation, agents known
to produce O.2, were determined in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells pretreated with AdMnSOD plus BCNU both in vitro and
in vivo. In vitro, AdMnSOD plus BCNU sensitized cells to the
cytotoxicity of Adriamycin or radiation. In vivo, AdMnSOD,
BCNU, and Adriamycin or ionizing radiation inhibited tumor
growth and prolonged survival. The results suggest that agents
that produce O.2 in combination with AdMnSOD plus BCNU
may represent a powerful new antitumor regimen against
breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4294–300]

Introduction
Within the antioxidant system, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is found in the mitochondrial matrix, from
which f75% of cellular superoxide (O.2) is generated. Cancer
cells almost always express low levels of MnSOD, and if the
activity of MnSOD is increased, the phenotype of cancer cells
should be at least partially reversed as hypothesized by Oberley
and Buettner (1). MnSOD catalyzes the dismutation of O.2 to
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), thus changing the balance between
O.2 and H2O2 and affecting signal transduction pathways that
modulate cell proliferation (2, 3). The tumor-suppressive effect of
MnSOD is supported by many studies demonstrating that
overexpression of MnSOD in transformed cell lines leads to
the reversion of the malignant phenotype (4–7) and MnSOD
overexpression alone has a largely noncytotoxic tumor suppressive effect in many cancer cell types (8). H2O2 may be the
effector species involved in the tumor suppressive effect of

MnSOD due to the fact that addition of pyruvate, a scavenger of
H2O2, can enhance the proliferation of MnSOD-overexpressing
cells (9). Also, coexpression of MnSOD and either catalase (10)
or glutathione peroxidase (11) can reverse the inhibition of cell
growth induced by MnSOD overexpression. These findings
implicate H2O2 as an important mediator for the inhibition of
cell growth induced by MnSOD overexpression. On the other
hand, without adequate peroxidase or catalase, SOD-overexpressing cells will be exposed to an increased steady-state concentration of H2O2. In the mitochondrial microenvironment, there
are many electron transport enzymes containing iron, and the
reaction between H2O2 and Fe2+ can lead to either the
production of HO. through the metal-catalyzed Haber-Weiss
reaction or the production of ferryl or perferryl species (12).
This is consistent with studies demonstrating that overexpression of SOD can sensitize cells to oxidant stress (13). Moreover,
buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis
that results in inhibition of peroxide detoxification, caused
dramatic cell killing in glioma cells that were stably transfected
with MnSOD cDNA and had little effect on the parental
cells (14).
1,3-Bis-chloroethyl-l-nitrosourea (BCNU) is a chemotherapy
drug that decomposes in aqueous buffer at physiologic pH to
form an alkylating moiety and a carbamoylating moiety. The
alkylating moiety reacts in the cell to alkylate purines or
pyrimidines, resulting in DNA and RNA cross-linking. The
carbamyolating moiety acts on nucleophilic alkyl side chain
groups of amino acids inactivating proteins, including glutathione
reductase (GR; refs. 15, 16). After exposure to BCNU, cells
increased the synthesis of new glutathione (GSH; ref. 17) and
also increased the percentage of glutathione disulfide (GSSG;
ref. 18), most likely due to the inactivation of GR, which converts
GSSG to GSH. If GR is inhibited, cells cannot remove H2O2 as
well. In a previous study from our laboratory, Weydert and
colleagues (8) showed that MnSOD-overexpressing human oral
squamous carcinoma cell lines were more sensitive to BCNU.
Cells treated with adenovirus contaning MnSOD (AdMnSOD)
alone showed >90% survival, whereas cells treated AdMnSOD plus
BCNU had the greatest cytotoxicity with <20% survival. In vivo
studies showed a 4- to 20-fold inhibition of tumor growth and
prolonged animal survival by the combined treatment of
AdMnSOD plus BCNU.
The purpose of the present study was to determine if a
superoxide radical generator, such as Adriamycin or ionizing
radiation, could increase the antitumor effect of AdMnSOD plus
BCNU both in vitro and in vivo. The hypothesis was that if we
would increase the levels of the substrate for MnSOD (O.2), we
would generate more product (H2O2) and thus obtain more
cytotoxicity.

laboratory (19). Glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) and GR primary antibodies
were obtained from Lab Frontier. Western blots were performed according
to the method described by Laemmli (20) using the same technique that has
been previously described in our laboratory (8). The SOD activity gel assay is
based on the inhibition of the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium by SOD
(21). The catalase activity gel assay was carried out according to the
methods described by Sun and colleagues (22). For the GR activity gel assay,
equal amounts of protein from different samples were subjected to
electrophoresis in 8% native polyacrylamide gels in nondenaturing running
buffer (pH 8.3). For GR band visualization, after electrophoresis, the gel
was stained with 250 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0) containing 3.4 mmol/L GSSG,
0.36 mmol/L NADPH, 0.052 mmol/L dichlorophenol-indophenol, and
1.1 mmol/L 3(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide
until blue precipitate GR bands began to form.
Glutathione measurement. The intracellular levels of GSH and GSSG
were measured according to the methods described by Anderson (23). After
reduced GSH was removed by mixing samples with 2-vinylpyridine, the
cellular GSSG level was measured by the same DTNB assay (24). Reduced
GSH was determined by subtracting the GSSG content from the total GSH
content. The concentration of samples was calculated by comparing the
rates of samples to the rates obtained from the corresponding standard
curve. The concentrations were then normalized to the protein content.
Plating efficiency. Cell survival was measured by clonogenic ability of
cells as previously described (25). After different treatments, cells
(250–3,000) were seeded in 6-well plates in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and

Figure 1. BCNU altered GR activity and glutathione in AdMnSOD -infected
MB231 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Cells were infected with either
100 MOI AdEmpty or AdMnSOD and then treated with different concentrations
of BCNU for 2 h. A, the activities of major antioxidant proteins were
measured by activity gel assay. AdMnSOD infection increased MnSOD activity
in MB231 cells, and increasing concentrations of BCNU inhibited GR activities
in both parental and AdMnSOD -infected cells in a dose-dependent manner.
Activities of other antioxidant proteins [copper zinc SOD (CuZnCOD ) and
catalase] were not changed. B, cells were collected and the GSH and GSSG
concentrations were measured. AdEmpty infection, AdMnSOD infection,
and BCNU alone had no effect on %GSSG, whereas AdMnSOD (100 MOI)
infection + BCNU (50 Amol/L) treatment resulted in a 2.1-fold increase in
%GSSG (*, P < 0.01 versus AdEmpty ; n = 3).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231
(MB231), purchased from American Type Culture Collection, was cultured
in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. Cells were incubated under a humidified atmosphere of 95%
air/5% CO2 at 37jC. Cells were passed weekly by treatment with 0.25%
trypsin/0.02% EDTA. Mycoplasma was tested at 3-mo intervals so only
Mycoplasma-free cells were used.
Adenovirus infection. AdMnSOD was manufactured at the University of
Iowa’s Vector Core Facility and is prepared by inserting the MnSOD gene
into the estrone (E1) region of an Ad5 E1/partial E3-deleted replicationdeficient adenoviral vector and has previously been described (8). The cDNA
is under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. AdEmpty
(adenovirus with empty shuttle vector and a CMV promoter) was used as a
vector control.
Immunoblotting and activity gels. The primary polyclonal antibodies
against human MnSOD and copper zinc SOD were developed in our

MnSOD overexpression. A, clonogenic survival after BCNU treatment without

10 Amol/L BCNU treatment. AdEmpty infection did not decrease cell survival.
AdMnSOD alone without BCNU slightly decreased cell survival to 85%.

of pyruvate reversed the decrease in clonogenic survival seen with the
AdMnSOD plus BCNU treatment when compared with BCNU or AdEmpty plus
BCNU (points, mean; bars, SE; n = 3).

weighing 20 to 23 grams (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.), were injected s.c.
with 4  106 MB231 cells suspended in PBS into the right flank region with
a 1 cc tuberculin syringe equipped with a 25-gauge needle. Tumors were
allowed to grow and the tumor size was monitored using a vernier caliper.
The tumor volume was calculated according to the following formula:
V ¼

where V is tumor volume, L is length, and W is width (5). After the
tumors reached f70 mm3, 1  109 plaque-forming unit (pfu) of AdMnSOD
suspended in a 3% sucrose PBS solution to a final volume of 100 AL were
delivered directly into the tumor using a 25-gauge needle attached to a 1-cc
tuberculin syringe. PBS with 3% sucrose (100 AL) was administrated as
control and AdEmpty alone was also administered as a vector control. Two
days later, upon maximal protein expression, 5 mg/kg dose of BCNU
(prepared as mentioned above, f50 AL) was injected directly into the
tumor mass. Controls were injected with the same amount of ethanol
in PBS. Four hours after BCNU injection, mice were treated with
either Adriamycin (3 mg/kg, diluted into injectable NaCL with a final
concentration of 50 AL) delivered intratumorly or 30 Gy radiation given at a
dose rate of 1.27 Gy/min. Before radiation, nude mice were anesthetized
with 80 to 100 mg/kg ketamine/10 mg/kg xylazine i.p. and shielded with a
lead block with only the tumor-bearing right hind flank exposed to
radiation. BCNU and Adriamycin were obtained from the clinical pharmacy
at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Tumor volumes were
measured every 3 d using a vernier caliper until the animals showed obvious
signs of illness. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation at the
conclusion of the experiment, when tumor volumes were >1,000 mm3, or
the animals were obviously ill. Tumors were sectioned and stored at 80jC
and examined for protein levels by Western blotting.
Statistical analysis. Mean values and SEs were determined using the
Microsoft Excel program. The ANOVA-Tukey test was used to compare the
differences between groups. In all cases, the statistical significance of
differences between groups was determined at a P value of <0.05. All the
data presented are from the average of at least three independent
experiments. The linear mixed model analysis (26) with random intercept
and random slopes were used to estimate and compare the group-specific
tumor growth curves. Statistically significant global test of equality across
groups was followed up with pairwise comparisons to identify-specific
group differences. Analyses were performed with the SAS and R4 statistical
software packages. The log-rank statistic was used to test the hypothesis of
equality of survival curves across the different groups. If the global test of
equality was significant, indicating at least two of the groups differ, a series
of two-sample tests comparing pairs of groups was performed. All Western
blots or activity gels were repeated at least twice to ensure reproducibility.

treated with BCNU (5 Amol/L) for 2 h, and then Adriamycin (0.05 Amol/L) and
clonogenic survival determined. AdMnSOD plus BCNU plus Adriamycin had the
greatest effect in decreasing clonogenic survival. The addition of Adriamycin
significantly decreased clonogenic survival in all groups (columns, means; bars,

(100 MOI), treated with BCNU (5 Amol/L) for 2 h, and then irradiated with 1, 2, or

(MOI)] infection increased MnSOD immunoreactive protein and
activity in MB231 cells 24 hours postinfection, peaked at 48 hours
after infection, and persisted for >72 hours (data not shown).
Our previous work showed that BCNU inhibited GR in a both
dose- and time-dependent manner. To determine the effect of
BCNU on GR in MB231 cells, AdEmpty- or AdMnSOD-infected cells
were treated with different concentrations of BCNU for 2 hours.
Treatment with 5 to 50 Amol/L BCNU caused a dose-dependent
decrease of GR activity (Fig. 1A). BCNU (25 mmol/L or above)
resulted in undetectable levels of GR activity. Inhibition of GR
activity after BCNU treatment was independent of the MnSOD
levels in the cells as both AdEmpty and AdMnSOD-infected cells

Figure 4. AdMnSOD infection increased MnSOD protein and activity levels, whereas
BCNU decreased GR activity in vivo. MB231 cells were injected into the flank of nude
mice and allowed to grow to f70 mm3. AdMnSOD (109 pfu) or the equivalent volume
of 3% sucrose in PBS was injected intratumorly, and 3 d later, mice were sacrificed
and the tumor was collected for protein and activity levels of MnSOD. A, intratumoral
injection of AdMnSOD increased both MnSOD protein and activity levels. B,
densitometric analysis was performed on the Western blots for MnSOD protein (left ) and
for the activity gels (right ) for MnSOD activity on all excised tumor tissue. Intratumoral
injections of AdMnSOD increased MnSOD protein and activity levels. C, MB231 cells
injected into the hind flank of nude mice were allowed to grow to f70 mm3. BCNU (5 or
15 mg/kg) was injected intratumorally. Controls received 100% ethanol in PBS at the
same volume. Four hours later, mice were sacrificed and the tumor was collected.
Intratumoral injection of BCNU decreased GR activity but not GR protein levels.

showed a similar inhibition. Also, the activities of other major
antioxidant enzymes (catalase and copper zinc SOD) were not
affected by either AdMnSOD infection or BCNU treatment
(Fig. 1A).
MB231 cells infected with 100 MOI AdMnSOD or AdEmpty
were treated with different concentrations of BCNU (Fig. 1B).
Cells were collected and GSH and GSSG were measured. BCNU
(50 Amol/L) resulted in a 1.35-fold increase in the percentage of
GSSG when compared with controls, whereas AdMnSOD plus
BCNU (5 Amol/L) caused a 1.62-fold increase in the percentage of
GSSG (P < 0.05 versus controls; means F SE, n = 3). AdMnSOD
plus BCNU (50 Amol/L) resulted in a further significant 2.1-fold
increase in the percentage of GSSG in cells (P < 0.05 versus
controls; means F SE, n = 3). Thus, there was a significant
increase in oxidative stress at BCNU concentrations that only
partially inhibit GR as shown in Fig. 1A.
To determine if increased H2O2 played a role in the sensitization
of MnSOD-overexpressing cells to BCNU, pyruvate, a H2O2 scavenger
(28), was used. After AdMnSOD infection, MB231 cells were treated
by BCNU with or without pyruvate. MnSOD overexpression
sensitized MB231 cells to BCNU (5 Amol/L). BCNU alone or BCNU
plus the AdEmpty vector control resulted in 72% clonogenic survival,
whereas MnSOD-overexpressing cells in the presence of 5 Amol/L
BCNU decreased clonogenic survival to 41% (Fig. 2A). Pyruvate
reversed the MnSOD + BCNU–induced cytotoxicity. In the presence
of pyruvate (10 mmol/L), MnSOD-overexpressing cells treated
with BCNU had a similar clonogenic survival as control or vectorinfected cells also treated with BCNU (Fig. 2B). These results suggest
that increased cell killing by AdMnSOD plus BCNU is largely due
to the presence of increased levels of H2O2.
Adriamycin is a quinone containing antitumor antibiotic (29)
that can be reduced to the Adriamycin-free radical semiquinone
(30), which then redox cycles with O2 to produce O.2 (31).

AdMnSOD plus BCNU-sensitized cells to the cytotoxicity of
Adriamycin as determined by clonogenic survival (Fig. 3A). In the
clonogenic assay, Adriamycin (0.05 Amol/L) alone resulted in 30%
clonogenic survival in MB231 cells, whereas the combination of
AdMnSOD 100 MOI, BCNU 5 Amol/L, and Adriamycin 0.05 Amol/L
resulted in 0.3% clonogenic survival (P < 0.05; means F SE, n = 3).
Radiation produces various ROS including O.2, H2O2, and HO..
MB231 cells were pretreated with AdMnSOD or AdEmpty for
48 hours and BCNU (5 Amol/L) for 2 hours, and then exposed to
1, 2, and 3 Gy delivered by 137Cs and clonogenic survival
determined (Fig. 3B). Three Gy irradiation decreased clonogenic
survival to 17%, whereas BCNU decreased clonogenic survival to
9%. The combination of MnSOD, BCNU, and 3 Gy-irradiation
resulted in a survival fraction to 2% (P < 0.05; means F SE, n = 3).
To test if intratumoral delivery of AdMnSOD or BCNU could alter
the protein and activity levels of MnSOD and GR, respectively,
MB231 cells were injected into the flank of mice and allowed to
grow to f70 mm3, AdMnSOD or BCNU were injected directly into
the tumor. Both Western blots and activity gels showed increased
MnSOD protein and activity in tumor tissue 48 hours after
AdMnSOD infection (Fig. 4A and B), whereas the activity of copper
zinc SOD was not affected (data not shown). BCNU treatment did
not change GR protein levels in the tumors, but it did inhibit GR
activity (Fig. 4C).
In all of the in vivo experiments, the statistical analyses focused
on the effects of different treatments on cancer progression. The
primary outcomes of interest are time to death and tumor growth
over time. To test the in vivo effects of increasing O.2 levels with
Adriamycin on AdMnSOD plus BCNU, tumor xenografts were
treated with nothing (controls), Adriamycin alone, AdMnSOD
alone, BCNU alone, AdMnSOD + Adriamycin, AdMnSOD plus
BCNU, BCNU + Adriamycin, AdEmpty plus BCNU plus Adriamycin,
or the combination of AdMnSOD, BCNU, and Adriamycin.

Table S1D summarizes the P values for pairwise comparison
among treatment groups. Of note, the tumor-free animal survival
was 62.5% in the AdMnSOD + BCNU + Adriamycin group compared
with no survivors with all other treatment protocols at day 327
(P < 0.05 versus other treatment combination groups; Fig. 5B).
To confirm the in vivo effects of increasing O.2 levels with
Adriamycin on AdMnSOD plus BCNU, tumor xenografts were
treated with nothing (controls), Adriamycin alone, AdMnSOD +
Adriamycin, BCNU + Adriamycin, or the combination of AdMnSOD,
BCNU, and Adriamycin. Tumor volume in mice treated with the
combination of AdMnSOD, BCNU, and Adriamycin once again was
decreased significantly compared with all other treatment groups
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). In addition, survival was greatest in mice
with tumors treated with the combination of AdMnSOD, BCNU,
and Adriamycin (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To test the in vivo effects of increasing O.2 levels with ionizing
radiation on AdMnSOD plus BCNU, tumor xenografts were
treated with nothing (controls), with radiation alone, BCNU +
radiation, AdMnSOD + radiation, AdMnSOD + BCNU, AdEmpty +
BCNU + radiation, and AdMnSOD + BCNU + radiation (Fig. 6A
and B). The same experiment was repeated (Supplementary
Fig. S2A and B), and in both sets of experiments, tumor volume
was compared among the groups. The group of mice that had the
combination of AdMnSOD + BCNU + radiation had the greatest
inhibition of tumor growth. Supplementary Table S3A summarizes the mean tumor sizes in seven groups. Figure 6A shows
the estimated growth curves from the fitted mixed linear regression model. The sample sizes given in the table are the total
number of measurements available within each group. The P value
was < 0.0001 for the global test of equality between the growth curves
across treatment groups. Pairwise group comparisons were carried
out to identify where the group differences occurred. The pairs of
groups for which the p values were <0.05 are presented in Supplementary Table S3B.
The groups of mice that received AdMnSOD + BCNU + radiation
had the greatest tumor-free survival than other groups as shown in
Fig. 6B and Supplementary Table S3C. Supplementary Table S3C
presents the mean survival times in the seven groups. The Log-rank
test comparing the survival times across the 7 groups had a P value
of <0.0001. Further pairwise comparisons identified where the
group differences occur. The results are presented in Supplementary Table S3D. In this set of experiments, only 1 out of 8 controls
were alive at day 28 (Fig. 6B). At day 80, AdMnSOD + BCNU +
radiation increased survival and resulted in complete eradication
of tumors in 6 of 7 mice resulting in an 87.5% survival that was
significantly greater than any other group of mice.
To confirm the in vivo effects of increasing O.2 levels with
ionizing radiation on AdMnSOD plus BCNU, the same experiment
was repeated (Supplementary Fig. S2). Once again, tumor volume
in mice treated with the combination of AdMnSOD, BCNU, and
ionizing radiation was decreased significantly compared with all
other treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The P value
was 0.0006 for the global test of equality between the growth
curves across treatment groups. In addition, survival was greatest
in mice with tumors treated with the combination of AdMnSOD,
BCNU, and ionizing radiation (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Log-rank
test for comparing the survival across the seven groups had a
P value of 0.006. In the groups of mice that received AdMnSOD +
BCNU + radiation, tumor-free survival was 80% on day 126,
whereas survival was 37% in the group of animals treated with
AdEmpty + BCNU + radiation, 28% in the group animals

receiving BCNU + radiation, and 12% in the group of animals
treated either with radiation alone or AdMnSOD + radiation. At
day 126 there were no survivors in the control group
(Supplementary Fig. S2B).

Discussion
Previous work in our laboratory has shown that MnSOD
combined with BCNU increases cancer cell killing in contrast to
the largely noncytotoxic tumor suppressive effect for MnSOD alone
(8). Elevating MnSOD in cells enhances the conversion of O.2 to
H2O2 and inhibiting peroxide removal through the GPx system
causes accumulation of H2O2 in cells, contributing to cell killing.
The purpose of our current study was to further extend the
cytotoxic effect of MnSOD plus BCNU by increasing endogenous
O.2. We had hypothesized that modalities that can induce the
production of O.2 are added to MnSOD and BCNU-pretreated cells,
higher concentration of H2O2 would be produced leading to an
increase in cell death.
Our current study shows that BCNU effectively inhibited GR
activity both in tissue culture cells and in tumor xenografts. The
inhibition of GR by BCNU was independent of the MnSOD levels
in the cells. Also, of the major antioxidant enzymes surveyed, only
GR was inhibited by BCNU; other enzymes, such as MnSOD, copper
zinc SOD, and CAT were not affected. Our study also showed that
enforced expression of MnSOD and inhibition of GR decreased
tumor cell clonogenicity in vitro, and decreased tumor xenograft
growth in vivo. Most importantly, the addition of exogenous
superoxide, either by Adriamycin or ionizing radiation, can
enhance the antitumor effect of AdMnSOD plus BCNU.
A reasonable explanation of these results is that H2O2 is the main
mediator in the cell killing induced by MnSOD plus BCNU. First,
elevating the MnSOD level in cells enhances the conversion of
O.2 to H2O2. Second, inhibition of the GR activity in cells by BCNU
resulted in inhibition of peroxide removal through the GPx
pathway. Zhong and colleagues (32) showed a significant
correlation between the sensitivity of glioma cells to BCNU and
catalase levels suggesting that inhibition of the glutathione system
results in catalase protecting against peroxide toxicity. To further
support the effect of H2O2, our current study showed that pyruvate
could reverse the sensitization to BCNU induced by MnSOD
overexpression.
Adriamycin is a quinone containing antitumor antibiotic (29).
It is electron affinic and the acceptance of one electron causes
Adriamycin to be reduced to the Adriamycin free radical
semiquinone (30). This semiquinone free radical cannot only
induce DNA damage by itself but also redox cycles with O2 to
produce O.2 (31). However, the potential of Adriamycin as a
widely used anticancer drug is compromised by the development
of life-threatening cardiac toxicity. It has been reported that
MnSOD overexpression can alleviate the Adriamycin-induced
mitochondrial damage in the heart of transgenic mice (33).
Together with surgery and chemotherapy, radiation therapy is
one of the major modalities for breast cancer treatment. After
ionizing radiation, MnSOD protein increased in a biphasic manner
with the first peak due to a preformed MnSOD protein or MnSOD
mRNA and the second peak due to an increase in new protein
synthesis (34). Chronic exposure to ionizing radiation induces an
adaptive response that decreases the cytotoxicity of radiation. This
adaptive response is caused by the alteration of nuclear factor-nB,
a stress-responsive transcription factor that regulates MnSOD

expression, which in turn enhances the expression of genes that
participate in radiation-induced adaptive responses (35). Overexpression of MnSOD reduces the levels of irradiation-induced
inflammatory cytokines (36), and reverses radiation-induced bone
marrow inhibition, cystitis, gastroenteritis, and esophagitis (37–40).
It has been reported that the murine hematopoietic progenitor cell
line that overexpresses MnSOD results in significant radioprotection compared with the parental cell line (41). However, MnSOD
overexpression did not protect hypoxic cells either morphologically
or in a clonogenic survival study (42). Thus, overexpression of
MnSOD has been shown to protect against both Adriamycin- and
radiation-induced damage and cytotoxicity. Our current study
shows that MnSOD overexpression can have the opposite effect
resulting in increased cell damage, if peroxide removal is inhibited.
Increased superoxide radical production with either ionizing
radiation or Adriamycin can increase the cell killing effect of
