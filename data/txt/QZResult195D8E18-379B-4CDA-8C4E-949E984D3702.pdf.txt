Abstract
NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) is a lethal pediatric tumor defined by the presence of BRD-NUT fusion
proteins that arrest differentiation. Here we explore the mechanisms underlying the ability of BRD4-NUT to
prevent squamous differentiation. In both gain-of and loss-of-expression assays, we find that expression of
BRD4-NUT is associated with globally decreased histone acetylation and transcriptional repression. Bulk
chromatin acetylation can be restored by treatment of NMC cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi),
engaging a program of squamous differentiation and arrested growth in vitro that closely mimics the effects of
siRNA-mediated attenuation of BRD4-NUT expression. The potential therapeutic utility of HDACi differentiation
therapy was established in three different NMC xenograft models, where it produced significant growth
inhibition and a survival benefit. Based on these results and translational studies performed with patientderived primary tumor cells, a child with NMC was treated with the FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat.
An objective response was obtained after five weeks of therapy, as determined by positron emission tomography.
These findings provide preclinical support for trials of HDACi in patients with NMC. Cancer Res; 71(7); 2686–96.

Introduction
Mechanistic study of cancer-associated translocations has
led to the development of effective therapies that target fusion
oncoproteins, particularly constitutively active tyrosine
kinases (1–3). In contrast, although successes such as targeting of PML-RARa fusion proteins with all-trans retinoic acid
and arsenic trioxide have been described (4–6), discovery of
ligands that directly target fusion oncoproteins that function
as transcriptional cofactors has proven to be challenging.

Because of this difficulty, there is great interest in targeting
the enzymatic components of higher-order gene regulatory
complexes, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs; ref. 7), but
clinical application of this approach has been limited. Examples include the use of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors
(DNMTi) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; ref. 8) and
HDAC inhibitors in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL; ref. 9).
NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) is a distinctive, aggressive
human cancer defined by rearrangements of the gene NUT
(10). These poorly differentiated carcinomas usually arise in
midline structures of the nasopharynx or mediastinum.
Although rare, NMCs occur throughout life and are often
mistaken for other entities, including thymic carcinoma,
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, lung carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma, and acute leukemia. Advanced local
disease is frequently accompanied by distant hematogenous
metastases. Commonly used therapies include surgical
debulking, consolidative radiotherapy, and cytotoxic chemotherapy, but even with multimodality therapy the median
survival from diagnosis is only 9.5 months.
In the majority of NMCs, most of the coding sequence
of NUT on chromosome 15q14 is fused in-frame to the 50
portions of BRD4 or BRD3, creating chimeric genes that
encode BRD-NUT fusion proteins (11, 12). The fusion proteins
retain BRD-encoded bromodomains, which bind acetylated
histones and recruit chromatin-remodeling complexes (13).
BRD4 facilitates transcriptional elongation and is associated
with mitotic chromosomes, a property that may act to

preserve epigenetic marks in daughter cells (14–16). NUT
encodes an unstructured polypeptide of unknown function
that is highly expressed in normal spermatids (11). A major
oncogenic effect of the BRD4-NUT fusion protein appears to
lie in its ability to arrest the differentiation of NMC cells (12).
Based on the recently reported observation (17) that NUT
directly binds to the histone acetyltransferase (HAT), p300, it
was hypothesized that BRD4-NUT sequesters HAT activity.
Here, we present data consistent with this model in which
BRD-NUT fusion proteins act by inducing global histone
hypoacetylation and transcriptional repression, effects that
can be reversed by HDAC inhibitors, which show promise as
targeted therapeutic agents for NMC.

Materials and Methods
Mammalian cells
The NMC cell lines TC797 (18), PER-403 (19), 00–143 (20),
TY82 (21), and 10326 (12), and the non-NMC squamous cell
carcinoma cell lines, HTB-43 (pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma; ref. 22) and HCC-95 (lung squamous cell carcinoma;
ref. 23), have been described. Patient tumor tissue was minced,
digested with collagenase, and cultured in WIT medium
optimized for carcinoma cells as described (24). 293T and
U2OS cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. A derivative of 293Ts, 293Trex, which contains a
single genomic FRT recombination site (25), was a gift from
Dr. Jeffrey D. Parvin. A tetracycline-inducible isogenic derivative, 293Trex-FLAG-BRD4-NUT was created by recombination
with the plasmid pcDNA5 FRT/TO-FLAG-BRD4-NUT (below)
using Flp-In technology (Invitrogen).
TC797, 00-143, TY82, 10326, U2OS, and 293T cells were
maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM,
Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum
(Hyclone), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U of penicillin G/mL,
and 100 mg of streptomycin/ml (Invitrogen) at 37 C under
5% CO2. PER-403 was maintained in the same media with
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate (Mediatech), 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 40 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol (American Bioanalytical). U2OS and 293T cells
were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). All
work with human discarded tissues and live cells was
performed in accordance with IRB protocol 2000-P001990/6; BWH. Trichostatin A (used at a concentration
of 25 nmol/L; Figs. 2 and 3) or 100 nmol/L (Supplementary
Figure S1) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) from American Bioanalytical.
TRex inducible cell lines
The FLAG-BRD4-NUT-inducible derivative of 293TRex was
created from commercially available 293TRex cells according
the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).
Expression plasmids
cDNAs encoding proteins of interest were assembled in the
vectors pcDNA5 FRT/TO (Invitrogen) and confirmed by DNA
sequencing.

Histology and immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell blocks of cultured
cells were prepared as described (12, 26) using Histogel
(Richard-Allan Scientific). Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or by immunohistochemistry (IHC), which
was performed on 5 mm sections prepared from formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumors, or cell blocks.
Immunohistochemical stains performed using anti-NUT rabbit polyclonal antibody (27), anti-NUT rabbit monoclonal
antibody (26), Ki-67 (MIB-1 clone; DAKO USA; ref. 12), and
PanKeratin (ref. 12; clone MNF116, DAKO USA) were as
described.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization
Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays
for BRD4 and NUT breakpoints were performed on formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded, 4 mm tissue sections as described
(20). Probes used for the 15q14 NUT breakpoint, flanking a
181kb region containing NUT, included the 30 telomeric BAC
clones 1H8 and 64o3, and the 50 centromeric clones 412e10
and 3d4. Probes used for the 19p13.1 BRD4 breakpoint were
the 50 centromeric BAC clone 187l3 and the 3’ telomeric BAC
clone 87m17.
High content screening
NMC cells were plated at a concentration of 1,000 cells per
well in black, clear-bottom, 384-well microtiter plates. Smallmolecule HDAC inhibitors were transferred from library
plates arrayed in a dose–response format using robotic pin
transfer. Following compound incubation for 48 or 72 hours,
cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (3.8%) and stained
with Hoechst, anti–acetyl-lysine (Cell Signaling Technologies),
or anti-cytokeratin (clone AE1/AE3, DAKO USA). Secondary
antibodies included rhodamine donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100,
Jackson Immuno Labs) and FITC pig anti-rabbit IgG (1:100,
DAKO USA). Three-color fluorescence images were acquired
using automated epifluorescence microscopy (ImageXPressMICRO; Molecular Devices) and analyzed using MetaXPress
(Molecular Devices), GraphPad Prizm, and Spotfire DecisionSite software.
Small interfering RNA and transient transfection
The design, synthesis, and electroporation of siRNA
duplexes specific for human NUT were as described (12).
Scrambled siRNA (Silencer Negative Control #1 siRNA Template, Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin) was used as a
negative control.
Immunoblotting
Proteins in cell extracts prepared with high-salt RIPA buffer
(50 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.0, containing 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 250 mmol/L NaCl, and 5 mmol/L
EDTA) were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically
transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore), and stained
with anti-NUT polyclonal antibody, or anti-FLAG (SigmaAldrich). Acid extraction of histones was performed as per
instructions (Millipore). Acid extracts were electrophoretically
separated, blotted as above, and stained with anti-acetyl

histone H4 (Millipore), anti–acetyl-histone H4 K8 (Abcam),
anti–acetyl-histone H3 K18 (Abcam), or anti-histone H3 polyclonal antibody (Abcam). Staining was developed using a
chemiluminescent method (SuperSignal, West Pico; Pierce).
Microarray analysis
Total RNA was isolated 24 hours post-siRNA transfection
(duplicate separate samples per cell line) or treatment with
trichostatin A (25 nmol/L, triplicate separate samples per cell
line) from TC797 and PER-403 cells using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). RNAs were further processed, labeled, and hybridized to Human Genome U133A Plus 2.0 microarray chips
(Affymetrix) in the Partners Healthcare Center for Genetics
and Genomics Gene Chip Microarray Facility, as described in
the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (revised version 4). After manually inspecting the quality of
arrays, GeneChip RMA (GCRMA) was used to normalize and
summarize expression as log2 values. Probe sets were filtered
based on minimum expression [log2(100)] and minimum
variance (interquartile range >0.5). Probe sets satisfying those
criteria were analyzed using the LIMMA (Linear Models for
Microarrays Data) package (28) to identify differentially
expressed probe sets using a q-value cutoff of 0.05 (Benjamini
and Hochberg corrected P value). Raw data and .cel files can
be accessed online at the gene expression omnibus (GEO)
website at the following link (29).
Radiologic imaging
Standard 18(F)-FDG PET and CT were performed at the
Department of Radiology at The Children's Hospital Boston,
MA.
Cell growth assay
Cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 5,000
cells/well and incubated for 2, 3, or 7 days in the presence of
0-1 mmol/L SAHA or DMSO. Relative cell numbers were
determined in 6 replicates using Cell Titer Glo (Promega)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Gene set enrichment analysis
Genes whose expression was significantly up-regulated
upon knockdown of BRD4-NUT in both TC-797 and PER403 cells were used as the comparison gene set in the gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA; ref. 30) of expression changes in
TC-797 and PER-403 cells following TSA (25 nmol/L) treatment. Gene permutation was used to estimate the significance
of enrichment for the BRD4-NUT gene set within the ranked
list of genes up-regulated in TSA-treated cells (1,000 permutations per GSEA).
In vivo studies
Xenograft tumors were generated from 2 established NMC
cell lines (TC-797 and PER-403) and from 1 low-passage
primary tumor (8645). Cells were transduced with a lentivirus
encoding firefly luciferase, mCherry, and puromycin phosphotransferase (31), followed by selection in 2 mg/mL of puromycin. A total of 107 cells in 100 mL of 30% Matrigel/70% PBS
were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6-week-old

2688

female NCr nude mice (Charles River Labs). Mice were serially
imaged after injection of 75 mg/kg D-luciferin using an IVIS
Spectrum instrument (Caliper Life Sciences). Tumor volumes
were calculated from caliper measurements using the formula
Vol ¼ 1/2  length  width2. Established xenograft tumors
were defined as tumors with increasing bioluminescence and
measurable tumor volume. Cohorts of mice with established
tumors were divided into groups with statistically equivalent
tumor burden, and treated daily with vehicle or 10 mg/kg of
LBH589 by intraperitoneal injection. Tumor burden was
determined by serial bioluminescence imaging and tumor
volume measurements. For survival studies, mice were sacrificed when tumors reached 2 cm in the largest diameter.
Statistical significance was determined by 2-tailed Student's
t test. Samples for histopathological analysis were fixed in 10%
buffered formalin. All animal studies were performed under
IACUC approved protocols.
Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction
Total RNA from TC-797 cells was harvested 24 hours after
siRNA electroporation or Trichostatin A (25 nmol/L) treatment using TRizol (Invitrogen) and further purified with an
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). One microgram of RNA was used
for cDNA synthesis using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad). qPCR was performed in duplicate on a Bio-Rad iCycler in
96 well plate format with IQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad)
and 1 mL of cDNA template per reaction. Amplification curves
and Ct values were generated using MyiQ Single-Color RealTime software (Bio-Rad). Transcript levels were normalized to
the RPL3 transcript as a cDNA input control. Data from 3
independent experiments are shown.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative
polymerase change reaction (ChIP-qPCR)
ChIP was performed using the SimpleChIP Enzymatic
Chromatin IP Kit from Cell Signaling Technologies. For each
IP, approximately 1.5  107 cells were crosslinked with 1%
formaldehyde for 10 minutes at 37 C and processed as per
manufacturer instructions. Total H3 was immunoprecipitated
with 10 mL of H3 antibody provided in the SimpleChIP Kit, and
acetylated histone H3K18 was immunoprecipitated with 10 mL
of ab1191 from Abcam. Negative control ChIP was performed
using rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch. qPCR was performed as described earlier using primers designed to amplify
promoter-proximal regions of the target genes. For each PCR
reaction, 2 mL of ChIP DNA was used. The ratio of H3K18Acet
to total H3 was calculated for each promoter and used to
determine relative changes in H3 acetylation upon Trichostain
A (25 nmol/L) treatment.

Results
Expression of BRD4-NUT is associated with a global
decrease in histone acetylation and overall repression
of gene expression
Recent findings indicating that NUT binds to, and activates
the HAT activity of p300 (17), prompted us to determine the

effects of BRD4-NUT on bulk chromatin acetylation. We found
that expression of BRD4-NUT in 293T cells markedly diminished H3K18, H4, and H4K8 acetylation, histone marks associated with gene expression. Conversely, siRNA-mediated
knockdown of BRD4-NUT in NMC cell lines increased, to a
more variable degree, acetylation of these same residues
within 24 hr (Fig. 1A). Changes in chromatin marks induced
by BRD4-NUT knockdown preceded morphologic changes
indicative of squamous differentiation (Fig. 1B), which is
marked by increases in nuclear size, open chromatin, and
cytoplasmic volume. In line with the observed increases in
activating histone marks, transcriptional profiling 24 hours
after siRNA knockdown of BRD-NUT, before morphologic
changes indicative of squamous differentiation, revealed that
among 369 genes that changed expression significantly in the
NMC line Per-403, a disproportionate fraction (87%) was upregulated, consistent with a repressive effect on gene tran-

scription. Similarly, 68% of genes that changed expression
following the knockdown of BRD4-NUT in the NMC line TC797 were up-regulated.
Restoration of acetylation using histone deacetylase
inhibitors induces a program of squamous
differentiation of NMC cells, phenocopying siRNAinduced silencing of BRD4-NUT
Based on these data, we postulated that global repression of
acetylation and transcription by BRD4-NUT may prevent the
expression of genes required for differentiation. If this idea is
correct, it follows that restoration of histone acetylation with
HDACi should induce NMC cell differentiation. To test this
idea, we treated NMC cells with the tool HDACi compound,
trichostatin A (TSA). Indeed, we found that TSA caused global
increases in histone acetylation (Fig. 2A), growth arrest
(Fig. 2B), and squamous differentiation marked by flattening

The induction of differentiation and arrested growth by TSA
was unique to NMC cells, as non-NMC squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were unresponsive to treatment (Fig. 2B and

(right), down-regulated genes. The concentration of vertical lines within the TSA (red) portion of the spectrum reflected in the running enrichment score plot
(green line) indicates the degree of correlation between upregulation in response to BRD4-NUT knockdown or TSA treatment.

these genes appears to be due to promoter acetylation, as
quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR (ChIPqPCR) with a-acetyl H3K18 antibody revealed enrichment
of 5 of the squamous differentiation associated gene promoters in TSA-treated NMC chromatin extracts (Fig. 3B).
To gain a broader view of the effects of siRNA and TSA on
gene expression, we performed GSEA using microarray data
from NMC cell lines treated with BRD4-NUT siRNA, or TSA.
GSEA revealed that genes that increased in expression following BRD4-NUT knockdown were highly enriched among those
that increased following TSA treatment (Fig. 3C, P value
<0.001 for both cell lines). Together, these findings suggest
that the NMC response to TSA is mediated through interference with BRD4-NUT function.
HDACi abrogate the growth of NMC cells in vitro and
in vivo
The correlates above suggested that HDACi should only
promote NMC differentiation at concentrations that cause
histone hyperacetylation, irrespective of their potency

against individual HDACs. To test this idea, we scored a
library of structurally dissimilar HDACi for effects on NMC
cells using a miniaturized high content assay that quantifies changes in bulk chromatin acetylation and expression of
keratin. Supplementary Figure S2A shows an example of this
analysis using NMC cells treated with the FDA-approved
HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (SAHA), a clinically approved
substance with prior pediatric experience. NMC cells treated
with SAHA exhibit increased histone hyperacetylation and
keratin expression by immunofluorescence microscopy
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Automated measurement of these
phenotypes revealed a dose-dependent induction of hyperacetylation and differentiation that was inversely associated
with cellular proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The
effects of 9 structurally unrelated HDAC inhibitors on histone acetylation and cell growth in 2 different NMC cell lines
(Table 1) were highly correlated (R2 ¼ 0.96; Supplementary
Fig. S2C, Table 1), strongly suggesting that the growth
inhibitory effects of these drugs is mediated through
increased histone acetylation.

To determine the in vivo efficacy of HDACi in NMC, we
created 2 luciferized NMC cell line xenograft models (TC-797,
PER-403). Tumor burden was assessed by bioluminescence
imaging (Fig. 4) and tumor volume. Mice with established
xenografts, defined as increasing bioluminescence and measurable tumor volumes, were divided into groups that were
treated with vehicle or HDACi. For this study, we used the
HDACi, LBH-589 (Novartis), an advanced second-generation
investigational HDACi used extensively in mice (32) that is
formulated for intravenous injection, and thus easier to
administer compared with SAHA (an oral medication). Significant suppression of tumor growth, as assessed by tumor
volume or bioluminescence, was apparent in both models
(Fig. 4A–C). In the PER-403 xenografts where survival analysis
was performed, significant survival benefit was seen in
HDACi-treated mice [P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 4C (bottom graph)].
Tumors in LBH-589 treated mice showed increased levels
of histone acetylation and morphologic and immunohistochemical changes (increased keratin expression) consistent
with squamous differentiation (Fig. 5). Taken together, the
findings indicate that HDACi induce differentiation and
growth arrest of NMC cells in vitro and in vivo, providing a
strong rationale for their therapeutic use in this disease.
An FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat, exhibits
antitumor activity in a pediatric patient with NMC
NMC commonly presents in pediatric patients and invariably progresses through cytotoxic chemotherapy. Metastases
frequently threaten vital structures and therapeutic options
are extremely limited. As the research above was being completed, a 10-year-old child was transferred to the Children's
Hospital of Boston for management of an aggressive mediastinal mass invading the left atrium and pulmonary vein. Partial
resection of this mass led to the diagnosis of NMC, based on
positive immunohistochemical staining for NUT and the pre-

sence of a BRD4-NUT fusion gene by FISH (Fig. 6A). Based on
the above findings, treatment of this patient with HDACi was
considered, and the only clinically approved HDACi with
experience in children was vorinostat (SAHA). Culture of
patient-derived NMC cells (designated 8645) established in
a medium optimized for the growth of carcinoma cells (24)
confirmed that vorinostat induced 8645 cells to undergo
squamous differentiation (Fig. 6B and C) and growth arrest
(Fig. 6B–D) as assessed by Ki-67 staining and cell counts. The
IC50 (based on Ki-67 fraction) and EC50 (based on keratin
expression) were calculated to be 250 nmol/L, well below the
known Cmax of vorinostat of 1.5–2 mmol/L. Following institutional approval and informed consent, the open-label administration of single-agent, oral vorinostat was initiated (400 mg
daily). At the conclusion of 5 weeks of drug therapy, a marked
decrease in tumor avidity for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose was
observed by positron emission tomography (PET; Fig. 6E).
The responsiveness of the patient's tumor to HDACi was confirmed by treating xenografted tumor cells from the patient with
LBH-589, which produced strong growth inhibition (P ¼ 0.0003,
Fig. 6F). Tumor response in the patient was accompanied by
marked thrombocytopenia (17,000/mL; normal range 150,000–
400,000/mL), an established dose-limiting toxicity of vorinostat
(33). Because of severe (NCI Grade 3) nausea and emesis, the
patient was unable to tolerate further vorinostat therapy, and
tumor recurrence was noted on PET scans performed 5 weeks
later (Fig. 6E). He was subsequently treated with a combination
chemotherapy protocol, and died due to recurrent and metastatic disease 11 months after initial diagnosis.

Discussion
NMC is an incurable cancer with an average survival of
9 months or less that is defined by the presence of NUT fusion
genes (11). We show here that BRD4-NUT expression is

associated with global histone hypoacetylation and transcriptional repression. The data are consistent with a recently
postulated model (17) in which BRD4-NUT binds to and
activates p300, thereby sequestering HAT activity to localized
regions of BRD4-NUT–acetyl-chromatin binding. This in turn
results in a relative overabundance of HDAC activity outside of
these regions, leading to global hypoacetylation and inadequate expression of genes required for differentiation. We
hypothesize that HDACi correct this imbalance by favoring
HAT activity, restoring chromatin acetylation, and increasing
the transcription of pro-differentiative genes.

This sequestration model is novel within the context of
epithelial cancer, but precedents are found in certain leukemias (34) and neuronal degenerative diseases. Expanded
polyglutamine repeats in the Huntingtin and androgen
receptor proteins bind and sequester CBP/p300, resulting in
global histone hypoacetylation and transcriptional repression
(35–38). Moreover, the sequestration and inactivation of
transcriptional cofactors in these complexes is reversible by
HDAC inhibitors (36, 37).
Regardless of the precise mechanism, the reversal of BRD4NUT–induced global hypoacetylation with HDACi is a novel

means of targeted "differentiation therapy" in cancer. The
striking in vitro and in vivo induction of differentiation and
inhibition of NMC growth by HDACi is of particular importance in this disease because there are currently 2 FDAapproved HDACi reagents, vorinostat and romidepsin, which
are available for immediate clinical investigation. There is an
urgent need for novel therapy in this disease because there is
currently no effective therapy for NMC, which has been
refractory to a number of different chemotherapeutic regimens (39). Increased recognition of NMC, enabled in part by
new diagnostic tests that rely on routine IHC (26), should
enhance the clinical evaluation of HDAC inhibitor drugs in
this malignancy, alone and in combination with other cytotoxic agents.
Another recently reported potential means to target BRD4NUT are small molecule bromodomain inhibitors (Brdi;
ref. 40). Brdi specifically abrogate binding of acetylated his-

2694

Cancer Res; 71(7) April 1, 2011

tones to the bromodomains of BRD4 and BRD3, and cause
differentiation of NMC cells in vitro and in mice. Nevertheless,
it is not clear what toxicity these molecules will have, as they
also inhibit acetyl–histone binding of native BRD4 and BRD3,
which are ubiquitously expressed proteins that may confer
epigenetic "memory" on cells (41, 42). This new class of
molecules is in the earliest stages of investigation and, unlike
HDACi, has not been used in humans.
The most specific targeting of BRD4-NUT would be
directed at NUT, which is not normally expressed outside
testis or ovaries (11). This will require mapping of protein:
protein interactions involving NUT at high resolution,
and development of NUT-directed inhibitors. Although
the development of deliverable small molecule inhibitors
of this type has proven difficult, the advent of stapled
peptides shows some promise to facilitate progress in this
field (43).
