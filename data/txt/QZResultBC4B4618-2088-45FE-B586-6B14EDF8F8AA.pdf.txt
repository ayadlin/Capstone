ABSTRACT:
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in prostate cancer
(PCa) metastasis. The transcription/translation regulatory Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is
known to be associated with cancer metastasis. We observed that YB-1 expression increased
with tumor grade and showed an inverse relationship with E-cadherin in a human PCa tissue
array. Forced YB-1 expression induced a mesenchymal morphology that was associated with
down regulation of epithelial markers. Silencing of YB-1 reversed mesenchymal features and
decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion in PCa cells. YB-1 is activated directly via Akt
mediated phosphorylation at Ser102 within the cold shock domain (CSD). We next identified fisetin
as an inhibitor of YB-1 activation. Computational docking and molecular dynamics suggested
that fisetin binds on the residues from β1 - β4 strands of CSD, hindering Akt’s interaction
with YB-1. Calculated free binding energy ranged from -11.9845 to -9.6273 kcal/mol. Plasmon
Surface Resonance studies showed that fisetin binds to YB-1 with an affinity of approximately
35 µM, with both slow association and dissociation. Fisetin also inhibited EGF induced YB-1
phosphorylation and markers of EMT both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively our data suggest that
YB-1 induces EMT in PCa and identify fisetin as an inhibitor of its activation.

INTRODUCTION

state. Cancer cells use this program to metastasize and
colonize at distant sites [2]. Often the metastatic EMT
resembles the molecular landscape of the developmental
EMT such as loss of cell-cell junctions, apico-basal
polarity and inheritance of migratory and invasive
features. The EMT program is primarily orchestrated
by one or several transcription factors (TF), mainly in
response to variety of extracellular signals like EGF, FGF,
IGF, TGF-β etc. [3]. The classical family of TF include
Snail, Twist, Zeb, Slug etc.[4-6]. Recent research has
added numerous new proteins than can direct the EMT
program either directly or indirectly by inducing the
classical TF. Among them Y-box–binding protein-1 (YB1) is a recently identified protein known to induce EMT in
different cancers [7].
YB-1 is a broad-specificity RNA-binding protein,
mainly involved in regulation of mRNA transcription,
splicing, translation, and stability [8]. Recent literature

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the leading cause of cancer
related deaths among American men. When detected
early the five year survival rate is close to 100% however,
detection at advanced metastatic stages severely declines
the overall survival [1]. These statistics suggest that high
mortality in PCa patients is due to metastasis. Metastasis
is a multistep process by which cancer cells disseminate
from their primary site to form secondary tumors at a
distant site. Metastasis involves a series of steps including
local invasion, intravasation, transport, extravasation, and
colonization.
During embryonic development cells travel long
distances to reach their final destinations. To achieve
this, epithelial cells rely on a very fine tuned and highly
regulated program known as epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) that converts them into a mesenchymal

suggests its important role in a variety of cancers including
prostate [9]. YB-1 plays various biologic roles in both the
nucleus and the cytoplasm; however, as a transcription
factor within the nucleus, YB-1 regulates the expression
of several genes, including proliferating cell nuclear
antigen, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
DNA topoisomerase II, CD44, phosphotidylinositol-4,5biphosphat 3-kinase, (PIK3CA,and MET) [10-14]. In PCa
YB-1 is associated with cell growth, anti-apoptosis, and
multi drug resistance [15-16]. YB-1 directly regulates
androgen receptor transcription and was found to be
upregulated during androgen ablated tumor progression
in a mouse xenograft model, suggesting that YB-1 plays
a role in the progression of both androgen-dependent
and castrate resistant PCa [17]. YB-1 is well linked with
Twist1 that regulates YB-1 transcription upstream in PCa
[18]. Similarly YB-1 induces the expression of clusterin,
an important EMT mediator [19], clearly suggesting some
involvement of YB-1 in EMT during PCa progression.
Based on existing literature it is clearly evident that YB-1
is associated with a variety of cancers including prostate
and has been specifically projected as an interesting drug
target.
Bioactive food components including plant
polyphenols are known to have potent anticarcinogenic
activities [20]. An important advantage with plant based
polyphenols, especially those from dietary sources, is that
they are perceived as non-toxic and have wide human
acceptance [21]. Fisetin (3,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxyflavone)
belongs to such a flavonol subgroup of flavonoids along
with quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol. It is present
in many fruits and vegetables most notably strawberries,
apples, persimmons, kiwis, cucumbers and onions. We
have previously shown that, fisetin acts as a dual inhibitor
of the PI3K/Akt and the mTOR pathways [22]. Also fisetin
induces cell cycle arrest, inhibits androgen signalling and
tumor growth in prostate cancer models [23-24].
In the current study we demonstrate that YB-1
expression leads to a change in cellular morphology
towards a mesenchymal phenotype and induces migration
and invasion of cells. We also identify a small molecule
fisetin that interacts within the cold shock domain (CSD)
domain of YB-1 and inhibits its phosphorylation at Ser102
both in vitro and in in vivo.

grade (Gleason grade 4 or 5) PCa. In the benign prostate
acini, YB-1 is expressed at a low level and is primarily
localized in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Following
transformation from benign to malignant, YB-1 expression
levels are elevated and also demonstrate an increased
expression in both peri-nuclear and nuclear spaces along
with cytoplasmic localization (Supplementary Fig.
1). These results clearly suggest that YB-1 increases
throughout malignant progression with increase in Gleason
grade. Next, we compared the expression of E-cadherin in
the same tissue samples by using dual labeling. Results
showed significant inverse relation between E-cadherin
and YB-1 in high grade prostate tissue samples when
compared with low grade prostate tissue samples (Fig. 1A
& B). Overall these results confirm an inverse relationship
in E-cadherin/YB-1 ratio in high grade PCa tissues
reinforcing a role for YB-1 in PCa.

Figure 1: YB-1 expression increases with increase
in tumor grade and is negatively correlated with
E-cadherin expression in human PCa tissues.

lines. A higher level of YB-1 protein was observed in all
tumorigenic PCa cells as compared to non-tumorigenic
cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A). To elucidate whether
YB-1 overexpression plays a role in the EMT in PCa we
overexpressed YB-1 in non-tumorigenic RWPE-1 cells
which mostly maintains an epithelial phenotype. Post
transfected RWPE-1 cells showed approximately 4.3 fold
increase in levels of YB-1 (Supplementary Fig. 2B), that
was associated with morphological changes indicative
of EMT (Fig. 3A). These cells grew as loose colonies
of elongated cells compared to the cuboidal, compactly
attached cells of control empty vector transfected cells.
Similarly, we observed significant reduction in the
transcript levels of epithelial markers viz. E-cadherin,
desmoplakin, zona-occuldin-1 (ZO-1) and occludin
along with induction in transcript levels of mesenchymal
markers viz. N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin in the
YB-1 overexpressed cells (Fig. 3B). Due to loss of cell
viability (Supplementary Fig. 2C) and induction of EMT
features it is difficult to sustain the growth of these cells in
vitro. Addition of EGF (50 ng/ml) in YB-1 overexpressed
cells significantly enhanced the viability and further
sustained the EMT, suggesting the important role of
extracellular growth/mitogenic signals in YB-1 mediated
EMT (Fig. 3A). We observed significant reduction in
epithelial markers and induction in the expression of
mesenchymal markers that were further enhanced by
EGF (Fig. 3C). We further confirmed the reduction in
E-cadherin and induction in vimentin expression by
immunofluroscence (Fig. 3D). We performed migration

Aberrant overexpression of EGFR has been
associated with both hormone-refractory and metastatic
PCa and is accompanied with proliferation, survival,
invasion and metastasis. EGF, the predominant ligand
to EGFR/ErbB1 receptors has been shown to induce
EMT in a variety of epithelial cancers including
prostate [25-26]. A recent study has also shown peculiar
YB-1 phosphorylation along with activation of YB-1
interacting kinases including Akt, EGF and MEK in EGF
treated PCa cell lines [27]. Taking these observations
in consideration we sought to determine the expression
and phosphorylation of YB-1 in an endogenous model of
EMT using RWPE-1 cells. As anticipated we observed
that exposure to EGF induced EMT like morphology in
(Fig. 2A) that was associated with down regulation of
E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin as observed
by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B). Most importantly, in
this model of EMT we observed YB-1 phosphorylation
is significantly upregulated (Fig. 2C).These observations
divulge a physiologically relevant role of YB-1 in
endogenously induced EMT by EGF.

We first determined the expression of both pYB-1
and YB-1 in non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic PCa cell

mediated YB-1 Ser102 phosphorylation. In order to
assess this we initially performed molecular docking
on the CSD of YB-1, known to be the most important
domain for YB-1 Ser102 phosphorylation. Fisetin docked
within the CSD on residues from β1 and β4 strands of
YB-1 protein. Top-ranked energy scoring poses of fisetin
share similar orientation patterns and binding modes
as well as overlapping features on their hypothetical
disposition within the binding site (Fig. 4A). Calculated
free binding energy (ΔGb) for these conformations ranged
from -11.9845 to -9.6273 kcal/mol, thus indicating
good ligand-protein affinities. In particular, best energy
docking conformation of fisetin showed consistent
binding modes and tight affinity within the amino acid
pocket that includes the following residues: Val63, Lys64,
Trp65, Phe66, Ile91, Gly104, Asp105, Gly106, Glu107
(Fig. 4B). The most favorable conformation places the
catecholic moiety in close proximity to the Glu107 and
the Glys104 and106, involving H-bond interactions with
these residues, whereas an arene-arene stacking between
the phenyl backbone of the chromen-4-one ring system
and the Phe66 was observed (Fig. 4C). The other amino
acid residues located near the binding site establish van
der Waals and hydrophobic interactions with fisetin.
Interestingly, the residue Trp65, considered to be very
important for the activity of YB-1, is also contained in the

Identification of Fisetin, a small molecule inhibitor
of YB-1 phosphorylation
Current literature for YB-1 clearly suggests its
pivotal role in cancer initiation, progression and drug
resistance; however little attention has been paid to it
as a direct therapeutic target. Akt, an established kinase
is an important regulatory kinase for YB-1 activation
through phosphorylation at Ser102. Additionally, mTOR
upstream to Akt is also known to regulate YB-1 at
translational level. We have shown that fisetin, a plant
derived small molecule as a potent inhibitor of PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway in different cancers including
prostate. Based on the Akt/mTOR driven regulation
of YB-1 we hypothesized that fisetin will inhibit Akt

predicted binding pocket.
To estimate more reliable conditions of enzymeligand complex in time-dependent manner, further
explorative MD simulations were performed. The
analyses revealed a consistent shifting of the flexible
loop constituted by the sequence from Tyr99 to Val109.
In particular, in the course of the experiment, the Ser102
establishes molecular interactions with Glu107, also
involving other residues such as Gly104 (Supplementary
Fig. 3C), Tyr99 and Arg101 (Supplementary Fig. 3D
& F). On the other hand, although several dynamic
conformational changes of the protein were found, fisetin
engaged in significant H-bond interaction with one
catecholic hydroxyl and the Glu107, as well as Gly104 and
Tyr99 (Supplementary Fig. 3C & F) during the simulation.
Fisetin always docked within the predicted site thus
promoting a stable ternary ligand-Glu107-Ser102 complex.
In this scenario, we hypothesized that fisetin could be
involved in stabilizing the Ser102-Glu107 interaction,
thus affecting the function of Ser102. Interference with
phosphorylation of YB-1 can indirectly affect the binding
to DNA, thus preventing the function of transcription
factor at a later stage. In order to confirm the modelling
data we performed Plasmon Surface Resonance (PSR)
and found that fisetin binds to YB-1 with an affinity of
approximately 35 µM, with both slow association and
dissociation (data not shown).
We

immunoprecipitation

experiments to see the effect of fisetin on YB-1/Akt
interaction and observed significant loss in the interaction
that confirmed our molecular docking experiments (Fig.
4D). The above finding provided evidence that fisetin
binds within the CSD region that might interfere with its
binding with activating kinases and we confirmed this
view by showing low interaction between Akt and YB-1.

Based on our data that pYB-1/YB-1 ratio is
increased in the tumorigenic PCa cell lines, we next
suppressed YB-1 expression by siRNA mediated gene
silencing. As expected we observed significant reversal in
cellular morphology towards an epithelial phenotype, and
decrease in migration in the two PCa cell lines DU145
and C4-2 (Supplementary Fig. 4A & B). We next tested
the efficacy of fisetin on decreasing the phosphorylation
of YB-1 expression in presence of EGF in another PCa
cell line LNCaP. As shown in Fig. 5A fisetin (60µM; 24h)
treatment significantly reduced the EGF induced YB-1
phosphorylation. We also tested the effect of fisetin on
YB-1 transcript levels and observed significant reduction
at 48 h. Down regulation of MTA-1, a downstream target
of YB-1 [28-30] further confirmed the effect of fisetin on
YB-1. (Fig. 5B & C).

Next, we tested fisetin to inhibit the EMT in an EGF
induced model of LNCaP cells. Cells treated with EGF
exhibited decrease in epithelial makers E-cadherin and
occuludin and increase in mesenchymal markers vimentin
and snail. However, fisetin treatment resulted in significant
recovery in the mRNA levels of epithelial marker
E-cadherin but not occuludin. Similarly, fisetin treatment
also down regulated the mRNA levels of vimentin and
slug (Fig. 5D). In order to confirm the fisetin mediated
inhibition of EMT at protein levels, we performed
immunofluroscence staining of E-cadherin and vimentin in
control, EGF, and EGF plus fisetin treated cells. As show
in Fig. 5E control LNCaP cells showed strong E-cadherin
expression and very low vimentin expression. However,
EGF treatment decreased E-cadherin and enhanced
vimentin fluorescence in LNCaP cells. Post EGF,
treatment with fisetin (60µM; 24h) significantly recovered
E-cadherin and suppressed the EGF induced vimentin
expression. These results confirmed the potential of fisetin
to inhibit the growth factor induced YB-1 phosphorylation
and EMT in PCa cells.

mice were euthanized and tumors were harvested. Fisetin
treatment significantly reduced both the tumor size and
weight in the xenograft mice (data not shown), which
corroborated well with our earlier findings showing fisetin
as potent inhibitor of PCa progression (Khan et al.). We
then performed immunofluroscence staining to assess the
effect of fisetin on YB-1 phosphorylation and EMT related
markers in the xenograft samples. We observed significant
induction in the YB-1 phosphorylation in the non-treated
tumor samples (Fig. 6A). Detailed analysis showed that
pYB-1 Ser102 was localized in both cytoplasmic and
nuclear compartments confirming earlier reports. We also
observed loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and
induction of mesenchymal markers vimentin and slug
(Fig. 6B & C). Additionally, we also found significant
induction of an important transcription factor slug known
to be a target for YB-1 (Fig. 6D). These results confirmed
that YB-1 phosphorylation is increased in PCa and also
had a negative correlation with E-cadherin loss clearly
corroborating the human PCa tissue immunofluorescence
data. Next we stained the fisetin treated tumor samples for
pYB-1 and observed significant decrease in the expression
of pYB-1 both in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments,
clearly suggesting YB-1 as a target for fisetin (Fig. 6A).
Further, we also checked the expression of EMT markers
in these samples. As expected we observed significant
induction in E–cadherin expression with concomitant
reduction in vimentin (Fig. 6B & C). E cadherin is also
known to be expressed in other cellular compartments
and negatively influences processes like EMT and
tumorigenesis. Fisetin induces E–cadherin expression not

Fisetin treatment inhibits EMT in vivo
The in-vitro results prompted us to look forward for
the similar effects in an in vivo scenario. We used nude
mice implanted with the advanced PCa cell line NB26,
known to be highly tumorigenic. Following the initial
tumor growth the mice were given fisetin (1 mg/kg/per
mice) for 28 days i.p. Post 28 days of fisetin treatment the

suggesting strong effect of fisetin on E-cadherin reexpression (Fig. 6B). These data clearly suggest that fisetin
significantly reduces YB-1 phosphorylation and EMT.

dependent translation [31]. Also, under similar conditions
YB-1 showed growth suppressive properties [32].
Therefore, it can be speculated that YB-1 overexpression
alone is not enough to induce a mesenchymal phenotype
in non-tumorigenic epithelial cells. From our observations
it seems that YB-1 mediated EMT program is a two tier
mechanism, where YB-1 phosphorylation is enhanced
by EGF and YB-1 further enhances the transcription and
translation of vimentin and snail to confer mesenchymal
like changes in the cells. However, it remains unclear
whether the reduction of E-cadherin as observed in our
results is a direct effect of YB-1 on its transcription and/
or translation. It is possible that upregulation of snail, a
potent and established negative regulator of E-cadherin by
YB-1 might be responsible for this, an argument that needs
further validation [7, 33-36]. The increased migration rate
of YB-1 overexpressed cells is in agreement with other
previous studies [26], however one striking observation
found in our study was that overexpressed cells showed
significantly enhanced migration rate even in the absence
of EGF, suggesting that YB-1 controls this property of
cells without getting phosphorylated by upstream kinases.
The enhanced migratory rate could also be supported by
matrix degrading metalloproteases’s (MMP) known to be
directly upregulated by YB-1 known to be involved in
cellular migration [37-39].
EGF-induced EMT like morphology has been
demonstrated as a crucial mechanism for the acquisition
of invasiveness. EGF activates distinct signaling
pathways, including ERK1/2, Akt, and Wnt to suppress
the expression of epithelial proteins like E-cadherin and
to increase the expression of mesenchymal proteins like
vimentin. Recently EGF exposure to tumorigenic PCa
cells was found to induce YB-1 phosphorylation in a dose
and time dependent manner suggesting this signaling is a
major effector of YB-1 mediated oncogenic function. Also
YB-1 is known to regulate the expression of EGFR. We
similarly observed that EGF exposure to non-tumorigenic
PCa cells significantly enhanced YB-1 phosphorylation
suggesting that EGF might utilize YB-1 to promote
EMT and metastasis. This observation seems to be quite
significant as activation of EGF-EGFR pathway has been
associated with aggressiveness in PCa patients.
After ascertaining the involvement of YB-1 during
PCa EMT, we next focused on the identification of a
possible YB-1 inhibitor. We chose to test fisetin for a
number of reasons: (a) fisetin is a dual inhibitor of both
PI3K/Akt pathways [22], which is one of the major kinase
for YB-1 phosphorylation, (b) fisetin inhibits mTOR
pathway [23-24], which is now shown to be important for
YB-1 mRNA translation [40] and based on our previous
observations fisetin inhibits the growth of PCa. As
observed in molecular docking experiments fisetin directly
interacted within the CSD of YB-1 protein, important for
binding of kinases and to phosphorylate and activate YB1. Fisetin not only binds within the CSD of YB-1 but

Fisetin inhibits TGF-beta induced YB1 expression
and EMT in PCa cells
TGF-β induced EMT is a well known model to
identify novel compounds/small molecules as inhibitors.
To strengthen our data that fisetin is a potent EMT
inhibitor we tested its efficay in the TGF-β induced EMT
model. As presented in Fig. 7A TGF-β exposure for 1h
did not induce any significant effect on both epithelial
and mesenchymal mRNA transcript levels in PCa cell line
(22Rv1); however, 24h treatment of TGF-β significantly
reduced the mRNA transcripts of epithelial markers
i.e. E-cadherin and occuludin, and also subsequently
increased the mRNA transcripts of mesenchymal markers
i.e. vimentin and snail. Similar results were observed at
protein levels. Fisetin treatment significantly reversed the
effect of TGF-β, as Fig. 7B clearly shows concomitant
upregulation of E-cadherin and down regulation of
mesenchymal markers, vimentin and snail. No change
in occludin expression was observed at protein levels by
fisetin, suggesting additional mechanisms. These results
confirmed that fisetin inhibits EMT process in a relevant
model.

DISCUSSION
The major findings of this study are: (i) Forced
overexpression of YB-1 in presence of EGF induces
persistent EMT in non-tumorigenic prostate cells, (ii)
YB-1 phosphorylation is strongly induced by EGF in
prostate cells, (iii) YB-1 expression is inversely correlated
with E-cadherin in human PCa samples, (iv) fisetin
interacts within the CSD domain of YB-1 resulting in
reduction in YB-1 phosphorylation at ser102 by reducing
its interaction with activating Akt kinase and (v) fisetin
inhibits EMT in both xenograft and in well-established
in vitro TGF-β model suggesting its potential as an EMT
inhibitor in PCa.
YB-1 overexpression in non-tumorigenic prostate
cells (RWPE-1) induced EMT like features; however
these cells tend to lose the phenotype and also showed
significant growth retardation. We believe there could be
two possible explanations for this. It may be possible that
these cells were not supported by extracellular growth
signaling/factors like EGF, IGF, bFGF etc. known to
phosphorylate YB-1, which seems to be important for its
oncogenic function and EMT inducing properties. This
notion is well supported by previous studies that showed
that in the absence of activated PI3K-Akt, YB-1 functions
as a tumor suppressor mainly by inhibiting the capwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

also alters its topology. These results suggest that fisetin
inhibits Akt mediated YB-1 phosphorylation mainly by
interfering with its binding to the CSD. Elevated Akt
activity in the cell did not affect expression levels of YB1, its subcellular localization, or general RNA-binding
ability. Instead, phosphorylated YB-1 was less capable of
cross-linking to the mRNA cap structure and of inhibiting
cap-dependent translation of a reporter mRNA. These
data suggest that YB-1 phosphorylation by Akt weakens
its cap-binding capability; thereby facilitating translational
activation of silenced mRNA species which mainly
includes EMT related mRNA. Similar observations were
made by [41] Law et al. 2010, using a small cell permeable
peptide that binds within the flexible region and interferes
with the 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) binding with
YB-1. We believe fisetin has several advantages over other
strategies to inhibit YB-1. Fisetin not only decreases YB-1
phosphorylation but also affects the labile pool of both
cytosolic and nuclear YB-1. It also acts on the upstream
kinases PI3K/Akt/mTOR to regulate the transcriptional
and translational of YB-1. Finally, fisetin is a naturally
occurring plant based flavonoid with no documented
toxicity in vivo and is readily available.
Based on these results we next tested fisetin to
inhibit EMT in a widely accepted model of EMT induced
by EGF and TGF-β. In PCa cells EGF induced the
disruption of epithelial cell plasticity, upregulated snail,
enhanced motility and invasion mainly through Aktdependent mechanisms, eventually promoting EMT and
invasiveness [38].Fisetin reduces EGF induced YB-1
phosphorylation and reverses EMT, suggesting fisetin’s
EMT inhibiting potential. We also found that fisetin
significantly reverses the TGF-β induced EMT in PCa
cells. Whether TGF-β induces YB-1 phosphorylation and
is important for EMT induction in PCa cells remains to be
elucidated. It seems plausible that fisetin inhibits mTOR
that is known to be upregulated by TGF-β and plays an
indispensable role in TGF-β mediated EMT [42-43].
In summary, we provide evidence that YB-1 is
upregulated in human PCa, has an inverse relationship
with epithelial marker E-cadherin and its forced expression
in non-tumorigenic PCa cells induces EMT and enhances
cellular migration. We also provide evidence that a small
molecule fisetin physically interacts with YB-1 and
inhibits its activity and subsequently inhibits EMT both
in vitro and in vivo.

authenticated by ATCC using a comprehensive database
of short tandem repeat DNA profiles and maintained as per
the recommendations of ATCC.

METHODS

Cell viability assay

Cell culture

The effect of YB-1 overexpression (RWPE-1) and
knockdown (DU145 and C4-2) on cell viability was
determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]- 2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The absorbance was
measured at 560 nm on a microplate reader (Bio-TEK
Instruments).

Plasmids
Full-length pcDNA-HATagYB-1, pcDNA (empty
vector), FLAG-YB-1 and FLAG-empty vectors were
obtained from Prof. Peter Mertens (Aachen, Germany) and
Prof. Sandra E. Dunn (Vancouver, Canada).

Cell transfections
For plasmid transfections, 1x106 cells (RWPE-1)
were transfected with either 1 μg of pcDNA (empty vector)
or pcDNA-HATagYB-1 vectors using Nucleofactor
technology, Lonza (Anaheim, CA). After 6 hours medium
was changed, cells were scraped 48hours for qPCR
analysis and 72 hours for immunoblot analysis.

siRNA
ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA for YB-1
and a nontargeting control siRNA were purchased from
Dharmacon. Cells were incubated with siRNA (100 nM)
and DharmaFECT reagent (#1) in antibiotic-free medium
for 48 hours was used to transfect the cells.

Real-time qPCR analysis for mRNA expression
Briefly, RNA was extracted from the nontumorigenic, tumorigenic and tumor tissue samples using
Rneasy kit (Qiagen), and reverse transcribed with iScript
Reverse transcription supermix kit (Biorad). cDNA (1100ng) was amplified in triplicate using gene specific
primers (Table-1). Threshold cycle (CT) values obtained
from the instrument’s software were used to calculate the
fold change of the respective mRNAs. ΔCT was calculated
by subtracting the CT value of the housekeeping gene from
that of the mRNA of interest. ΔΔCT for each mRNA was
then calculated by subtracting the CT value of the control
from the experimental value. Fold change was calculated
by the formula 2−ΔΔCT.

The following human non-tumorigenic and
tumorigenic cell lines were obtained from ATCC
(Manassas, VA): RWPE-1, LNCaP, DU145, 22Rν1,

Cell migration and invasion assays

calculations were performed using the docking simulation
feature MOE-dock by setting grid sizes that included the
entire macromolecule. The triangle matcher was used
as placement method to generate docking poses, and
the London ΔGbinding scoring function that estimates
the free energy of binding (kcal/mol) was used to rank
hit candidates, after a force field based refinement and
rescoring. Only the best scored poses generated in
the docking experiments were retained and examined
with MOE. After docking, a molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation to the best docking complex was performed
using the MD option (MOE-dynamic) included in the
MOE suite of programs. Before MD experiment, a
minimization energy calculation of the ligand-protein
complex was conducted by using the above-mentioned
procedure, until RMSD gradient 0.1. The other parameters
were adjusted to default values, and the Nosé-PoincaréAndersen thermostat algorithm in a canonical number of
particles, volume, and temperature (NVT ensemble), was
used for creating ensemble trajectory. The temperature
was raised from 0 to 300 K, while the other parameters
were kept as default. After system equilibration, 300 ps of
MD were recorded and six snapshots were considered (50,
100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 ps).

Cell migration and invasion was performed by using
the commercially available kits from Millipore (Billerica,
MA) as per the manufacturer protocol. However, for nontumorigenic RWPE-1 cells KSFM complete medium with
serum and for tumorigenic DU145 and C4-2 cells RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS was added to the lower
chambers. Experiments were conducted in triplicate for
each cell line.

Immunofluorescence analysis
4-8 μm thick sections were obtained from frozen
blocks of tumor xenograft tissues, and mounted on
superfrost plus slides. Slides were stored at −80°C until
needed. Prior to staining procedure, slides were warmed
at room temperature for 5 min and fixed in ice-cold
acetone for 15 min at 4°C, followed by washing in PBSTween 20 (x% PBST). LNCaP cells were fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde and washed 3 times with ice cold PBS.
Further both types of slides were then blocked with normal
serum block (mention serum name and % of serum here.
Ex. Normal goat serum etc) followed by incubation with
different antibodies with appropriate dilutions as described
in supplementary table 1. After rinsing in PBST, slides
were incubated with fluorescent-conjugated secondary
antibody at 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer. Slides
were then rinsed in PBST, and sections were mounted
with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent containing DAPI
(Invitrogen) and left in dark overnight. Fluorescence
imaging was performed using Nikon A1 confocal
microscope ((Nikon Instruments Inc. New York, USA).
Images were acquired with 20x objective at 1024 X 1024
resolutions. Image analysis was accomplished using the
Nikon Elements software.

In vivo tumor xenograft model
Athymic (nu/nu) male nude mice (Harlan, USA)
were housed under pathogen-free conditions with a 12-h
light/12-h dark schedule and fed with an autoclaved diet ad
libitum. We chose AR-positive NB26 cells for determining
the in vivo effects of fisetin based on the fact that these
cells form rapid and reproducible tumors in nude mice and
also secrete PSA in the bloodstream of the host. Sixteen
animals were then randomly divided into two groups, with
8 animals in group 1 and 8 animals in group 2. The first
group of animals received i.p. injection of DMSO (30 μL)
and served as control. The animals of groups 2 received
i.p. injection of fisetin (1 mg/animal) in 30 μL of DMSO
twice weekly. Tumor sizes were measured twice weekly as
described previously23. All animals of group 1 and group
2 were sacrificed when tumors reached a volume of 1,200
mm3 in the control group. All procedures conducted were
in accordance with the guidelines for the use and care of
laboratory animals.

In silico molecular dynamics study
Ligand docking studies were performed using
Molecular Operating Environment (MOE). Threedimensional structure of cold-shock domain (CSD)
of Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) used for docking
experiments was downloaded from the PDB Data Bank
(http://www.rcsb.org/-PDB code:1h95). Before docking,
the protein structure was properly protonated using the
Protonate 3D option, and was geometrically optimized
and minimized by employing AMBER99 force field with
a generalized Born solvation model. The partial charges
were automatically calculated. The structure of fisetin
was built in MOE and minimized before the docking,
using the MMFF94x force field, with the systematic
algorithms until a RMSD gradient of 0.001 kcal mol-1
Å-1 was reached. Rigid receptor-flexible ligand docking

Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version
5; GraphPad Software). Two-tailed, unpaired t test was
used. Data points in graphs represent mean ± SD, and p
values < 0.05 were considered significant.
