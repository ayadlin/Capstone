BACKGROUND: Although it is known that standard 5-fluorouracil–based chemoradiation therapy for rectal cancer
causes significant acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, research on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is limited. The
authors undertook the current study to assess the feasibility of incorporating PRO measurement into routine clinical
practice and to describe the trajectory of symptom development during treatment. METHODS: Seventy-seven consecutive patients who were treated between 2006 and 2008 were eligible. Patients completed the 7-item Bowel
Problems Scale immediately before weekly physician visits. RESULTS: The questionnaire completion rate was 95%.
Individual GI symptoms had different trajectories of development. By Week 5, approximately 40% of all patients
developed clinically meaningful pain, bowel urgency, or tenesmus that was not present during Week 1; 30% developed diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and passing mucus. However, overall symptom burden was moderate. Seventyfive percent of patients who presented with rectal bleeding at Week 1 improved by Week 3 of treatment. Within
each physician-assessed grade of diarrhea, patient experience varied widely. For example, of the 50 patients who
developed grade 2 diarrhea on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Acute Morbidity Scale, the numbers of
patients reporting only occasional symptoms versus those reporting frequent or very frequent symptoms were similar. CONCLUSIONS: PROs provided information on patient symptoms during chemoradiation treatment for rectal
cancer that was not captured otherwise, and it was feasible to incorporate PROs into routine clinical practice.
The current results may be used by physicians to counsel their patients before treatment initiation and to

KEYWORDS: quality of life, rectal neoplasms, drug therapy, radiotherapy.

Concurrent radiation therapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemotherapy, which is part of the standard multimodality treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer, causes significant acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. In the German
Rectal Cancer Study, which randomized patients to receive preoperative versus postoperative chemoradiation therapy,
Sauer et al reported that 28% to 32% of patients experienced grade 2 to 5 acute diarrhea.1 Similar rates have been reported
by others.2-5 In our experience, although rectal bleeding is a common presenting symptom that improves with treatment,
acute GI symptoms like tenesmus, abdominal cramping, and bowel urgency also develop during therapy. However, the frequency and severity of these symptoms and the time course of symptom development have not been described well in the
literature. This may be because of the lack of a readily available toxicity scale to describe GI symptoms other than diarrhea.
Although physician-assessed toxicity is commonly reported by prospective studies, health-related quality of life
(QOL) is recognized increasingly as an important outcome in cancer treatment.6,7 There is growing evidence that patientreported outcomes (PROs) provide important additional symptom data8-10 and also may have prognostic

significance.6,11-14 In rectal cancer, in which acute GI
symptoms frequently are observed clinically, few studies
have examined PROs. In the current study, we prospectively collected patient-reported GI symptoms weekly
during chemoradiation treatment to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating PRO measurements into clinical
practice and to describe the trajectory of symptom development. We also assessed the severity of diarrhea using
the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Acute
Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria15 and compared
results from patient reports with physician assessments.
We hypothesized that 1) it would be feasible to incorporate serial PRO measurements into the routine clinical
care of patients with rectal cancer who were receiving concurrent chemoradiation treatment, and 2) additional information (compared with physician assessments) would
be captured by patient reports in this patient population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment
At the Massachusetts General Hospital, 77 consecutive
patients who received concurrent 5-FU–based chemoradiation therapy for de novo rectal adenocarcinoma
between February 2006 and August 2008 were eligible for
inclusion in this analysis. Patients had not received previous chemotherapy or abdominal radiation therapy, and
all patients had an ECOG performance status 2. This
study was approved by the institutional review board.
Patients received standard fractionation radiation
therapy at a dose of 1.8 Gray (Gy) to 2.0 Gy daily, 5 treatments per week, to a minimum intended total dose of 45
Gy; 92% of patients received 50.4 Gy of radiation therapy. The standard treatment duration was 5 weeks (45
Gy) to 5.5 weeks (50.4 Gy), so all patients had the opportunity to complete 5 weekly PRO questionnaires. Two
patients who completed fewer than 4 of 5 weekly PRO
questionnaires were considered ‘‘nonparticipants’’ and
were excluded from analysis, resulting in the final cohort
of 75 patients. Of these, 69 patients (92%) received neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (QOL before surgery),
and 6 patients (8%) received adjuvant treatment (QOL
after surgery). Seventy-four patients (99%) received continuous infusion 5-FU throughout the course of radiation
therapy, and 1 patient received oral capecitabine.
Quality-of-Life Instrument and Analysis
PRO data were collected prospectively using the 7-item
Bowel Problems Scale developed by Clark and Talcott,

1880

which was validated previously in patients who received
pelvic radiation therapy for prostate cancer.16 The following 7 questions were asked on the questionnaire: 1) In the
past week, have you had diarrhea or loose watery stools? 2)
Have you had a sense of urgency that you move your bowels? 3) Have you had any tenderness or pain when you
move your bowels? 4) Have you had bleeding with your
bowel movements? 5) Have you had abdominal cramping
or pain? 6) Have you passed mucus from your rectum? 7)
Have you had the feeling that you have an urge to move
your bowels but have nothing to pass?
Patients self-reported the frequency of each on a
5-point Likert scale as follows: ‘‘not at all’’ (score 1),
‘‘occasionally’’ (score 2), ‘‘fairly frequently’’ (score 3), ‘‘frequently’’ (score 4), or ‘‘very frequently’’ (score 5). With
this instrument, it has been demonstrated previously that
a score 3 is associated with clinically meaningful distress17; therefore, this was an a priori chosen outcome to
represent clinically meaningful symptoms for this study.
Immediately before weekly on-treatment visits with the
radiation oncologist, patients completed this short questionnaire, so the data were available for the physician to
review before the encounter. Physicians graded the severity of diarrhea using the RTOG Acute Morbidity Scoring
Criteria.15 Demographic and clinical information was
obtained from patient medical records.
The primary endpoint of this study was the frequency and severity of each patient-reported GI symptom
during chemoradiation treatment. Therefore, descriptive
statistics were the mainstay of analysis. Rectal bleeding
was considered separately from the other symptoms in
this analysis, because bleeding from rectal cancer improves
acutely rather than worsens with treatment. Secondary
endpoints were physician-graded diarrhea and the rate of
questionnaire completion to assess the feasibility of incorporating PROs in routine clinical practice. The questionnaire completion rate was calculated as the number of
questionnaires with at least 5 questions answered divided
by the total number of potential questionnaires that could
be administered from Week 1 to Week 5.

RESULTS
Baseline Patient Characteristics
Among the 75 patients who were included in this study,
76% were men, and the median age was 57 years (range,
18-86 years) (Table 1). Most patients had stage II or III
disease.

Patient-Reported Symptoms
Figure 1 illustrates the frequency and severity of 6 GI
symptoms at Week 1 and Week 5, representing the beginning and end of the chemoradiation treatment course,
respectively. Not surprisingly, the significant majority of
patients at Week 1 reported ‘‘not at all’’ (score 1) or ‘‘occasionally’’ (score 2) for each symptom. All 6 symptoms
worsened by Week 5: Patients in general had mild-tomoderate symptoms (scores 2-3), and <25% of patients
experienced each symptom ‘‘frequently’’ (score 4) or ‘‘very
frequently’’ (score 5) (Fig. 1, Table 2).
The time course of development differed among
these symptoms. On the basis of previous work by Talcott
et al using the Bowel Problems Scale,17 we defined a score
of 3 as a clinically meaningful endpoint, because it represented a level of symptoms that caused patient distress.
Figure 2 (Top) shows that the development of score 3
diarrhea, bowel urgency, and tenesmus increased sharply
between Weeks 2 and 3 of chemoradiation treatment, and
slower increases were observed between Weeks 4 and 5.
Pain developed later, and there was a sharp increase in
incidence between Weeks 3 and 4, whereas abdominal
cramping and passing mucus had relatively slower
increases in symptom development. By Week 5, approximately 40% of patients experienced score 3 pain, bowel
urgency, or tenesmus that was not present during Week 1;

Figure 1. The frequency and severity of patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms at Week 1 and Week 5 are illustrated among
patients who filled out both Week-1 and Week-5 questionnaires. Symptom severity was scored as 1 (not at all), 2 (occasionally), 3
(fairly frequently), 4 (frequently), or 5 (very frequently). Because of missing values, sample sizes varied (range, 66-68 patients).

approximately 25% to 35% of patients had developed
score 3 diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and passing mucus (Fig. 2, Top; Table 3).
To assess the overall symptom burden, we examined
the mean score across 6 items in the Bowel Problems Scale
by week (Fig. 2, Bottom). Although 80% of patients had a
mean score of 2 across all symptoms by Week 5, 32%
had an average score of 3, and <10% had an average
score of 4.
Improvement in Rectal Bleeding
Among the 37 patients who had rectal bleeding before
treatment initiation (of 70 patients who answered this
question on the Week 1 questionnaire), 59% improved
by Week 2 of treatment, and 76% improved by Week 3
(Fig. 3). However, 16% of patients reported no improvement in rectal bleeding by Week 5.
Physician-Reported Diarrhea
The majority of patients developed grade 2 diarrhea (50
of 75 patients; 67%) on the RTOG Acute Morbidity
Scale and required parasympatholytic medication,

1882

whereas 4 patients developed grade 3 diarrhea (who
required parenteral support), and none developed grade 4
diarrhea. However, based on PROs, patient experience
varied widely within each toxicity grade (Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION
PROs have been identified by the National Cancer Institute as a priority area for research.18 Complementing physician-reported
toxicity
and
other
objective
measurements, PROs provide additional symptom information from the patient’s perspective that may not be captured fully by using other measurements and that often
are underreported by physician assessments.7,19-23 Therefore, there is increasing recognition of the value of PROs
in the evaluation of the treatment impact on patient
QOL, in assessments of treatment tolerability, and as part
of the decision-making process by physicians on whether
to adopt new therapies for their patients.7,24,25 This recognition has led to efforts by the National Cancer Institute,
working with the cooperative groups, to encourage and
facilitate the incorporation of PROs into phase 2, phase 3,
and supportive therapy trials.18

ing PROs are limited, and currently available data do
not provide adequate information for physicians to
counsel their patients about the potential QOL impact
of treatment. Clinical trials commonly report physiciangraded diarrhea, which may not fully capture the QOL
effects from the patient’s perspective and may underrepresent the true prevalence of this symptom. Although
previous studies have reported an approximately 30%
rate of physician-reported, acute, grade 2 to 5 diarrhea,1-3,5 in clinical practice, it is observed more commonly. In addition, other treatment-related, acute GI
symptoms are observed frequently in the clinic but are
not described well in the literature. Consistent with the
stated goals of the National Cancer Institute, we undertook the current study to assess the feasibility of incorporating PRO measurement into routine clinical
practice and to quantify the frequency and severity of
patient-reported GI symptoms during chemoradiation
treatment for rectal cancer. We hypothesized that 1) it
would be feasible to incorporate serial PRO measurements into the routine clinical care of patients with rectal cancer who are receiving concurrent chemoradiation
treatment, and 2) additional information (compared
with physician assessments) would be captured by
patient reports in this patient population.
We measured weekly PROs in consecutive patients
who were treated between 2006 and 2008. Immediately
before weekly on-treatment visits with the radiation
oncologist, patients completed the short, 7-item Bowel
Problems Scale. We were able to achieve a high completion rate of 95%, and only 2of 77 consecutive patients
were excluded because of nonparticipation, probably attributable in part to the low response burden from the
short questionnaire.23,25,26 The instrument appeared to
be appropriate for this patient population and treatment,
and all items were sensitive to treatment-related changes.
Anecdotally, we believe that the PRO measurement did
not lengthen clinical visits and that having PROs available
facilitated communication and the management of
patient symptoms. These observations have been demonstrated empirically by others23,27,28 but were not measured formally in the current study.
Our results indicate the prevalence and severity of
acute GI symptoms during chemoradiation treatment.
Between 25% and almost 50% of the patients in our
cohort developed each symptom to a level that is considered clinically significant or distressful, and the time
course of development varied for different symptoms. In

initiation, most improved by the second week of treatment, whereas 76% improved by Week 3.
We identified 2 other studies in the literature that
examined PROs during treatment for rectal cancer, but
neither addressed the specific questions of our study.
Guren et al reported outcomes for 42 patients who
received either preoperative radiation therapy (without
chemotherapy) or postoperative radiation therapy with
concurrent 5-FU/leucovorin. EORTC questionnaires
were administered at baseline, at the end of treatment, and
4 to 6 weeks afterward.29 Consistent with our results, the
authors reported an increase in the mean scores of diarrhea, GI problems, and defecation problems at the end of
the treatment course. However, the trajectory of symptom
development was not described, and the majority of the
cohort did not receive concurrent chemotherapy. Haddock et al described weekly bowel function outcomes dur-

1884

ing and after radiation therapy in 123 patients with pelvic
malignancies, including 12 patients who had rectal cancer.30 Although not all patients received concurrent 5-FU,
and the severity of symptoms was not assessed, patients
reported the most number of GI symptoms between
Week 3 and Week 5 of treatment, similar to our findings.
The discrepancy between the reported percentages
of patients that developed diarrhea from physician assessments (even in a setting where PRO information is available at the time of physician evaluation) versus those
reported by patients in this study supports the benefit of
PROs in documenting patient experience. Although the
expected incidence of grade 2 diarrhea from most studies that reported physician-assessed symptom development was approximately 30%, 66% of the patients in our
cohort developed grade 2 diarrhea on the RTOG Acute
Morbidity Scale, necessitating parasympatholytic medication. Patient experience varied widely within each toxicity
grade (Fig. 4). Our results suggest that the Bowel Problems Scale, with levels of severity that captured timedependent symptom changes, may be a more sensitive
instrument with which to describe patient symptoms

during treatment and underscore the importance of PRO
measurement to complement standard physician-based
toxicity assessment.
A frequent problem in studies that assess PROs is
missing data. In this study, because of the low response
burden of the QOL instrument, we were able to achieve a
very high completion rate. A limitation of this study is
that, although the instrument that we used has been well
described and was validated previously in patients who
received pelvic radiation therapy for prostate cancer, it
had not been used in the setting of rectal cancer treatment.
However, we believe that this instrument is ideal in its
ease of administration during clinical visits, its low
response burden to patients, and its ability to capture the
most salient symptoms observed clinically. A formal validation study for use in rectal cancer patients is ongoing.
In summary, recognizing the importance of and
need for PROs in rectal cancer, we demonstrated that
it is feasible to incorporate PRO measurement into
routine clinical practice using the well described Bowel
Problems Scale and that the additional information
captured by PROs complements the standard physician-based toxicity assessment. To our knowledge, this
is the most comprehensive study to date and reports
carefully documented PROs in a relatively large cohort
of consecutive patients with rectal cancer who received
standard 5-FU–based chemoradiation therapy. We
describe the frequency, severity, and trajectory of acute
GI symptoms during treatment. Although symptoms
are frequent, they rarely are severe. Our results provide
symptom data from the patient’s perspective and may
be used by physicians to counsel their patients before
initiating therapy. In addition, as PRO measurements
increasingly are incorporated into clinical trials, our
results provide a benchmark against which new treatment agents or modalities may be compared so that
their potential disease control and survival benefits may
be balanced against the effects on patient QOL.
