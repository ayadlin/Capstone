ABSTRACT
Development of malignancy is accompanied by a complete metabolic
reprogramming closely related to the acquisition of most of cancer hallmarks. In
fact, key oncogenic pathways converge to adapt the metabolism of carbohydrates,
proteins, lipids and nucleic acids to the dynamic tumor microenvironment, conferring
a selective advantage to cancer cells. Therefore, metabolic properties of tumor
cells are significantly different from those of non-transformed cells. In addition,
tumor metabolic reprogramming is linked to drug resistance in cancer treatment.
Accordingly, metabolic adaptations are specific vulnerabilities that can be used in
different therapeutic approaches for cancer therapy. In this review, we discuss
the dysregulation of the main metabolic pathways that enable cell transformation
and its association with oncogenic signaling pathways, focusing on the effects of
c-MYC, hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and the
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) on cancer cell metabolism. Elucidating these
connections is of crucial importance to identify new targets and develop selective
cancer treatments that improve response to therapy and overcome the emerging
resistance to chemotherapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

that are considered essential to drive malignancy and
known as the hallmarks of cancer [2]. These hallmark
capabilities include sustaining proliferative signaling,
evading growth suppressors, avoiding immune destruction,
enabling replicative immortality, activating invasion and
metastasis, inducing angiogenesis, resisting cell death and
reprogramming cellular metabolism. In addition, there
are two consequential characteristics of tumorigenesis
that enable the acquisition of the hallmarks of cancer. The
most prominent is the development of genomic instability
and mutability, which endow tumor cells with genetic
alterations that can orchestrate tumor progression. The
second one involves the tumor-promoting inflammation
by innate immune cells, which in turn serve to support
multiple hallmark capabilities [2].
Non-transformed cells tightly regulate the
mitogenic signaling that command cell growth and
division in order to maintain a balance between cell
proliferation and death. Accordingly, the dysregulation
of the signaling pathways that regulate the progression
through cell cycle, cell survival and metabolism may
lead to malignant transformation. It is worth noting
that neoplastic transformation requires not only the
alteration of proliferative stimuli but also the disruption

Multifactorial diseases are the final result of
the interaction between genetic susceptibility and
environmental factors in which a clear hereditary pattern
is not found. This complexity causes difficulties in the
risk evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.
Cancer, one of the most prevalent multifactorial diseases,
is characterized by the lost of physiological control and the
malignant transformation of cells that acquire functional
and genetic abnormalities, leading to tumor development
and progression. In some cases, cancer cells have the
ability to invade other tissues resulting in metastasis, the
major cause of death from cancer. According to the most
recent data released by the World Health Organization
(WHO) in 2012, more than 14 million of new cancer
cases were diagnosed, and 8.2 million cancer deaths and
32.4 million people living with cancer (within 5 years
of diagnosis) were registered worldwide [1]. The most
common cancers by primary site location were lung,
prostate and colorectal in men, and breast, colorectal and
cervix uteri in women [1].

of mechanisms that prevent unrestrained proliferation
such as programmed cell death (apoptosis) or negativefeedback signaling [3]. Likewise, the cooperative
activation of oncogenes (genes that promote cell growth,
proliferation and survival) and/or inactivation of tumor
suppressor genes (genes that restrain cell growth and
proliferation, promote DNA repair or trigger apoptosis)
are involved in tumor development [3, 4]. Oncogenes
can be activated through several mechanisms including
upregulated transcriptional expression, increased stability
of mutant proteins, altered functionality of proteins and
abnormal recruitment or subcellular localization of gene
products through interaction with aberrantly expressed or
mutant binding partners [3, 5]. The products of oncogenes
comprise transcription factors (e.g. c-MYC, hereafter
referred to as MYC), growth factor receptors (e.g. EGFR),
signal transduction proteins (e.g. RAS and PI3K), serinethreonine protein kinases (e.g. Akt, mTOR, CDK4 and
CDK6) and inhibitors of apoptosis (e.g. BCL2) [5]. On
the other hand, tumor suppressor genes encode proteins
that inhibit cell division and cell proliferation (e.g. RB,
p53, p16INK4a, PTEN), stimulate cell death (e.g. caspase 8
and p53) and repair damaged DNA (e.g. MSH2, MSH6,
ATM and ATR) [6].
Accumulation of genetic alterations is associated
with tumor evolution, which includes single nucleotide
mutations and also whole-chromosomal changes [7-9].
In addition, epigenetic mechanisms including histone
modifications, DNA methylation and non-coding
RNAs are involved in carcinogenesis [10, 11]. In fact,
tumors often display aberrant methylation patterns
such as hypermethylation on the promoters of tumor
suppressor genes causing transcriptional repression, and
hypomethylation of oncogenes supporting their activation
(reviewed in [11, 12]). Epigenetic modifications have been
reported to regulate the Warburg effect and coordinate
the overall cellular metabolism, including the pentose
phosphate pathway and other pathways for sugar, lipid
and amino acid metabolism, by affecting several metabolic
enzyme activities [13-16]. Remarkably, oxidative stress is
involved with both genetic and epigenetic modifications,
playing an important role in carcinogenesis [10, 17].

molecules through energy-consuming processes. The
metabolic network is regulated by signaling pathways that
respond to the specific cellular needs which, in turn, may
vary depending on the cell type and proliferative state.
Despite the fact that there are several metabolic
similarities between tumor and highly proliferating nontransformed cells (reviewed in [18]), oncogenic regulation
and tumor microenvironment have a distinctive influence
on the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. In
particular, tumor cells switch their core metabolism
to meet the increased requirements of cell growth and
division. Indeed, tumor metabolic reprogramming
involves the enhancement of key metabolic pathways such
as glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, glutaminolysis
and lipid, nucleic acid and amino acid metabolism [19]
(Figure 1). Thus, activation of oncogenic signaling
pathways adapts tumor cells metabolism to the dynamic
tumor microenvironment, where nutrient and oxygen
concentrations are spatially and temporally heterogeneous
[20, 21]. The dependencies on specific metabolic
substrates such as glucose or glutamine exhibited by
tumor cells are determined by the alterations in their
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. For instance,
MYC-transformed cells display addiction to glutamine
as a bioenergetic substrate and are sensitive to inhibitors
of glutaminolysis [22]. Accordingly, the characterization
of the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells and its
connection with oncogenic signaling is a promising
approach to identify novel molecular-targeted strategies
in cancer therapy.

Glycolysis and the Warburg effect
Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway by which
glucose and other sugars are metabolized to pyruvate
in an oxygen-independent manner to generate energy in
the form of ATP and intermediates, which are used as
precursors for the biosynthesis of macromolecules [23].
Under physiologic oxygen concentrations, pyruvate enters
the mitochondria to be oxidized through an oxygendependent process known as oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS), which couples the oxidation of metabolites
and the electron transport chain (ETC) with ATP
production, being also a potential source of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) [20].
The first metabolic phenotype observed in tumor
cells was described by Otto Warburg as a shift from
oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis to
generate lactate and ATP even in presence of oxygen,
which is known as the Warburg effect [24, 25]. Therefore,
cancer cells convert most incoming glucose to lactate
rather than entering in the mitochondria to be oxidized
through oxidative phosphorylation [26]. Initially, it was
believed that the Warburg effect resulted from defects
in the mitochondrial function of cancer cells. However,
this effect is also exhibited by tumor cells with intact and

METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING OF
TUMOR CELLS
Metabolism is the term that is used to describe
the integrated network of chemical reactions involved
in sustaining growth, proliferation and survival of cells
and organisms. These reactions are catalyzed by tightly
regulated enzymes, which sense environmental cues and
provide energy, reducing power and macromolecules to
supply the cellular needs. Metabolic reactions can be
classified into catabolic pathways that produce energy
(adenosine triphosphate, ATP) through the breakdown
of molecules, and anabolic pathways that synthesize

functional mitochondria, suggesting that their preference
for glycolysis might confer benefits on them such as
reduced levels of ROS, high production of metabolic
intermediates for macromolecular biosynthesis and
acidification of extracellular microenvironment due to
lactate excretion [27, 28]. It is worth noting that the ATP
produced per molecule of glucose catabolized through
glycolysis is considerably less efficient than through
oxidative phosphorylation (2 versus 31-38 molecules of
ATP [29], respectively), causing tumor cells to greatly
increase both the rate of glucose uptake and glycolysis
to sustain their increased energetic, biosynthetic and
redox needs [30]. Conveniently, the high glycolytic rates
displayed by cancer cells allow their visualization by
18
F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-

PET) and assist tumor detection, prevention and treatment
[31].
Over the past decade, numerous studies and reviews
have supported the hypothesis that the Warburg effect
can be explained by the alterations in multiple signaling
pathways resulting from mutations in oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes [21, 28, 32-35]. The complex network of
mechanisms leading to the Warburg phenomenon includes
mitochondrial changes, upregulation of rate-limiting
enzymes in glycolysis involving specific isoforms such
as M2 pyruvate kinase and hexokinase 2, intracellular
pH regulation, and hypoxia-induced switch to anaerobic
metabolism (reviewed in [35]). The enhanced glycolytic
rate can be sustained through the overexpression of
glucose transporters [36] and several key glycolytic

enzymes [37] mediated by specific activated oncogenes
(e.g. PI3K and MYC) and transcription factors (e.g. HIF1),
contributing to the acquisition of the Warburg effect and
maintaining tumor cell growth and survival [21, 28, 33].
Likewise, loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor
TP53 (encoding p53) also contribute to the Warburg
effect, since they prevent i) p53-mediated transcriptional
repression of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4;
ii) activation of cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein
(SCO2) expression, which promotes OXPHOS; and iii)
upregulation of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis
regulator (TIGAR) expression, which reduces the
intracellular concentration of the glycolytic activator
fructose-2,6-bisphosphate [20, 38].
Interestingly, the metabolic switch in tumor cells
has a key role in the establishment of many other cancer
hallmarks [19]. In fact, some metabolic enzymes have
been described as multifaceted proteins which can directly
regulate transcription, glucose homeostasis and resistance
to cell death [39, 40]. For example, hexokinase 2 isoform
(HK2), which catalyzes the rate-limiting first step of
glycolysis, plays a key role for the Warburg effect in
cancer [41-43]. Specifically, HK2 bounds to mitochondria
and is recognized as a signaling component controlling
cellular growth, preventing mitochondrial apoptosis and
enhancing autophagy [44, 45]. The competitive binding
of HK2 to the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC)
in the outer mitochondrial membrane prevents the union
of VDAC with pro-apoptotic Bax, inhibiting cytochrome
c release from mitochondria and avoiding apoptosis after
Bax activation [44]. Therefore, targeting multifunctional
metabolic enzymes may restore the susceptibility of tumor
cells to cell death, offering new options for cancer therapy.

anabolic demands and counteract oxidative stress [47-49].
PPP is divided into the oxidative branch and the
non-oxidative branch. The oxidative branch catalyzes
the irreversible transformation of glucose-6-phosphate
into ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), yielding NADPH.
The non-oxidative branch is a reversible pathway that
interconverts R5P and glycolytic intermediaries. The
enzymes that mainly regulate the PPP are glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in the oxidative branch
and transketolase (TKT) in the non-oxidative branch [5052]. Several oncogenic signaling pathways promote G6PD
activation by post-translational mechanisms [46], while
tumor suppressor p53 directly inhibits G6PD and the PPP
[48]. PPP is coordinated with cell cycle since proliferating
cells increase G6PD activity during late G1 and S phases
[53]. Moreover, the activation of the SCF ubiquitin ligase
by its interaction with the protein-b-transduction repeatcontaining protein (b-TrCP) allows the recognition of
PFKFB3 and its proteasome degradation during S phase
[54, 55], promoting the shuttling of glycolytic substrates
through the PPP and increasing the production of NADPH
and R5P to allow S phase progression.

Lipid metabolism
Triacylglycerides, phosphoglycerides, sterols and
sphingolipids are hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules
known as lipids. Fatty acids are long hydrocarbon chains
with a carboxy-terminal group that constitute the main
component of triacylglycerides and phosphoglycerides,
being also present in sphingolipids and sterol esters.
While triacylglycerides are used as energy storage units,
phosphoglycerides, sterols and sphingolipids are major
structural components of plasma membranes. Lipids are
also involved in signal transduction and participate in the
regulation of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation,
survival, apoptosis, membrane homeostasis, motility and
drug resistance [56, 57].
Tumor metabolic reprogramming involves an
increase in lipid biosynthesis to supply the building
blocks for membrane formation and sustain the high
proliferative rate of tumor cells. Distinctively, tumor cells
mainly activate and thrive on de novo lipid biosynthesis,
while most non-transformed cells rely on extracellular
lipids. Oncogenic signaling enhances lipogenesis through
the increase of precursors for fatty acids synthesis (i.e.
promoting glucose and glutamine transport, glycolysis,
PPP and anaplerosis) and the upregulation of many
lipogenic enzymes such as ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), fatty
acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)
[58-61]. The acetyl groups for fatty acids biosynthesis are
provided by mitochondrial citrate, which is exported to the
cytosol where ACLY catalyzes its conversion into acetylCoA and oxaloacetate [62]. Then, malate dehydrogenase
(MDH) and malic enzyme (ME) can produce pyruvate
from oxaloacetate, yielding part of the NADPH required

Pentose phosphate pathway
Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is one of the main
metabolic pathways that enables tumor cell proliferation
by regulating the flux of carbons between nucleic acid
synthesis and lipogenesis to support DNA replication
and RNA production. DNA and RNA nucleic acids are
polymers composed by combinations of four different
nucleotides which in turn are constituted by an organic
base (purine, in the case of the nucleotides adenine
and guanine, or pyrimidine, in the case of cytosine,
thymine, and uracil), a pentose sugar (ribose for RNA or
deoxyribose for DNA) and one or more phosphate groups.
The pentose phosphate is mainly obtained through the PPP,
which also generates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH). NADPH is an essential cofactor for
providing reducing equivalents for lipid and amino acid
biosynthesis, and for modulating oxidative stress through
the maintenance of the reduced glutathione (GSH) pool
[46]. The association between upregulation of PPP and
tumor cell proliferation is been extensively studied, as PPP
plays a pivotal role in allowing tumor cells to meet their

for fatty acid biosynthesis. In addition, lipid biosynthesis
is also connected to other pathways that generate NADPH,
such as the oxidative branch of the PPP. Next, acetyl-CoA
is converted to malonyl-CoA by ACC, and both acetyl and
malonyl groups are condensed through a cyclical series
of reactions by FASN, resulting in long-chain saturated
fatty acids, predominantly palmitate. Further elongation
and desaturation of de novo synthesized saturated fatty
acids can be obtained through the action of elongases and
desaturases [56, 63]. On the other hand, the mitochondrial
degradation of fatty acids through Î²-oxidation releases
large amounts of ATP and generates ROS through the TCA
cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation [56, 57].
Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins
(SREBPs) transcription factors regulate the expression
of most enzymes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids
and cholesterol. In turn, SREBPs are negatively regulated
by tumor suppressors such as p53, pRB and AMPK,
and activated by oncogenes such as PI3K and Akt. For
instance, besides promoting glycolysis, Akt upregulates
the expression of the lipogenic enzymes through activation
and nuclear translocation of SREBP [64], and positively
regulates ACLY by direct phosphorylation [65], linking
enhanced glycolysis with increased lipogenesis [63, 66].
Therefore, targeting lipogenic pathways is thought to
be a promising strategy for cancer therapy, as lipogenic
enzymes are found to be upregulated or activated in tumor
cells to satisfy their increased demand for lipids [57, 58].

oxaloacetate and Î±-ketoglutarate can generate aspartate,
asparagine and glutamate. Moreover, glutamate can
be converted to L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde (GSA)
and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), which are further
converted to ornithine and proline, respectively [70].
Then, ornithine can enter the urea cycle and produce
arginine. Also, serine can generate glycine and contribute
to the synthesis of cysteine [71].
Highly proliferating cells, like tumor cells, consume
essential and non-essential amino acids from external
sources since the capacity of endogenous synthesis is not
sufficient to fulfill their amino acidic increased needs [72].
However, most amino acids are hydrophilic molecules
that require selective transport proteins to cross the cell
membrane. Accordingly, four amino acid transporters
(SLC1A5 [22, 73], SLC7A5 [73], SLC7A11 [74] and
SLC6A14 [75]) have been found to be overexpressed
in cancer cells in a MYC-dependent manner or through
miR-23a repression mediated by MYC to increase the
uptake of amino acids and meet their growing demands
[72]. Interestingly, the functional coupling of SLC1A5 and
SLC7A5 glutamine transporters suggests that enhanced
glutamine metabolism in tumor cells can contribute to
drive tumor growth through activation of mTOR [68].
In tumor cells, the consumption of some amino
acids (specially non-essential amino acids) greatly
exceeds the requirements for protein biosynthesis,
suggesting their use as intermediates in metabolism
by providing one carbon units, replenishing the TCA
cycle or synthesizing fatty acids, nucleotides and other
amino acids [71]. For example, glutamine, glycine and
aspartate are required for nucleotide biosynthesis, while
serine and glycine play an essential role in a one-carbon
metabolism, generating precursors for the biosynthesis
of lipids, nucleotides and proteins, regulating the redox
status and participating in protein and nucleic acid
methylation [76, 77]. The conversion of serine to glycine
can be catalyzed either by the cytosolic or mitochondrial
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1 and SHMT2,
respectively). Interestingly, the metabolic activity of
SHMT2 has been shown to strongly correlate with
the rates of proliferation across the NCI60 cancer cell
collection [78]. In fact, SHMT2 has been suggested as
fundamental to sustain cancer metabolism by fuelling
heme biosynthesis and thus oxidative phosphorylation
[79].
It is worth noting that the reactions catalyzing the
degradation of proline produce significant amounts of
ROS. The first step of proline degradation is catalyzed
by the mitochondrial proline dehydrogenase (PRODH),
which is a tumor suppressor that inhibits proliferation and
induces apoptosis [70, 80]. This mitochondrial enzyme is
linked to the electron transport chain through complex III,
being shown as a source of ROS generation. In addition,
P5C and proline can act as a redox couple, carrying
reducing potential into and oxidizing potential out of the

Amino acid metabolism
Amino acids are organic compounds containing a
specific side chain and both amino and carboxyl groups
that enable them to undergo polymerization to form
proteins. In addition, amino acids can be metabolized
as a source of carbon and nitrogen for biosynthesis.
There are 20 different amino acids, 11 of which can be
endogenously synthesized by mammal cells while the
remainder are known as essential amino acids, which must
be obtained from external sources. In fact, amino acids
have a pivotal role in supporting proliferative metabolism
and are required for cell survival. It is not surprising
that cells have developed an amino acid sensing system
through the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
signaling to determine whether there are sufficient amino
acids available for protein biosynthesis. Specifically,
leucine, glutamine and arginine serve as critical signaling
molecules that activate mTOR pathway [67, 68]. In
response to amino acid deficiency, inhibition of mTOR
rapidly suppress protein synthesis and induce autophagy,
in order to maintain a free amino acid pool which may be
required during prolonged amino acid limitation [69].
Non-essential aminoacids can be synthesized from
glycolytic intermediates such as 3-phosphoglycerate,
which is the precursor for serine, or pyruvate, that can be
converted to alanine. In addition, TCA intermediates like

mitochondria by the combined activities of mitochondrial
PRODH and the cytosolic form of P5C reductase (PYCR),
which preferably uses NADPH [70, 80, 81].
It is worth noting that glutamine is the amino acid
presenting the most prominent role in tumor metabolism.
Accordingly, some tumor cells have been reported to
exhibit dependence on glutamine for survival [22, 82].

death, and regulation of signal transduction pathways
through ROS production, modulation of cytosolic
calcium levels and trafficking of small metabolites.
Indeed, impairment of mitochondrial function and
reduction of mitochondrial biogenesis greatly suppresses
tumor formation, growth and proliferation [63, 83, 84].
Conversely, enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis is
advantageous for tumor cells [63, 85]. On the other hand,
alterations in mitochondrial function can lead to several
diseases including cardiovascular dysfunctions, muscular
degeneration and cancer [83, 86].
In the presence of oxygen, oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) is the most efficient mechanism for
synthesizing ATP [29]. OXPHOS is coupled to the

Mitochondrial metabolism
Mitochondrial function is essential for cancer cells
as it is involved in numerous crucial cellular processes
such as ATP generation, regulation of programmed cell

Figure 2: Mitochondrial metabolism. Schematic representation of the biosynthetic and bioenergetic reactions of the TCA cycle and

the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is coupled to the oxidation of NADH and FADH2, which are produced in the TCA
cycle, via the electron transport chain (ETC, also known as the mitochondrial respiratory chain). The ETC comprises four complexes (I to
IV) that transfer electrons generating a gradient of protons (H+) in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, which is used by the ATPase
(complex V) to produce ATP. Reductive carboxylation of Î±-ketoglutarate by IDH1 and IDH2 produces citrate (dashed arrows). ACLY, ATP

oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) through
the electron transport chain. The mitochondrial respiratory
chain, located in the mitochondrial inner membrane,
comprises four complexes (I to IV) that are responsible
for the oxidation of the reducing equivalents in the form
of NADH or FADH2 and the reduction of molecular
oxygen (final electron acceptor) to water. This process is
coupled to the pumping of protons into the mitochondrial
intermembrane space, resulting in a proton gradient that
is used by the ATPase (complex V) to produce ATP [87]
(Figure 2).
Among the metabolic pathways that take place
in the mitochondria, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
is a route of pivotal importance for the entire cellular
metabolism and, in particular, for oxidative metabolism.
Remarkably, TCA cycle provides precursors for the
biosynthesis of lipids, nucleic acids and proteins, as well
as reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH2) for ATP
production (Figure 2). Mutations in several genes that
encode enzymes of the TCA cycle including isocitrate
dehydrogenase [88, 89], succinate dehydrogenase and
fumarate hydratase [90] are associated with some tumor
types, leading to the dysfunction of the TCA cycle
and the accumulation of its substrates [86, 91, 92].
Interestingly, it has been shown that increased levels
of TCA cycle intermediates fumarate and succinate
can affect Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent histone and DNA
demethylases, HIF stabilization, and cellular responses to
O2 depletion [90, 93]. Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs)
catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to
Î±-ketoglutarate, which is required as a substrate for
numerous dioxygenases, including histone demethylases,
prolyl hydroxylases, collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylases, and
the TET family of 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases [94,
95]. There are three IDH enzymes; IDH1 is found in the
cytosol and peroxisome, while IDH2 and IDH3 isoforms
are localized in the mitochondria. Mutations targeting
IDH1 and IDH2 result in loss of their native enzymatic
activities and lead to the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate,
a metabolite that can competitively inhibit Î±-ketoglutaratedependent dioxygenases and is associated with
tumorigenesis [95-97].

glutamine dependence [99].
The expression levels of oncogenes (e.g. MYC [22,
100], mTOR [101] and KRAS [102]) and tumor suppressors
(e.g. SIRT4 [103] and TP53 [104]) are decisive to regulate
glutamine metabolism [92, 105], to the extent that tumor
genetics can dictate cellular dependence on glutamine for
survival [98]. For instance, tumor cells overexpressing
MYC reprogram their mitochondrial metabolism to
depend on glutamine for the maintenance of cell viability,
mitochondrial integrity and TCA cycle anaplerosis,
triggering cellular addiction to glutamine and displaying
increased sensitivity to glutamine deprivation [22, 100].
In addition to glycolysis, many tumor cells also rely
on glutamine to fulfill their bioenergetic and metabolic
needs. Indeed, glutamine catabolism is the source of many
precursors for major anaplerotic processes such as the
TCA cycle. Cells requiring de novo lipid biosynthesis, like
tumor cells, divert citrate from the TCA cycle to produce
lipogenic acetyl-CoA. The depletion of citrate from the
TCA cycle creates a need for anaplerotic replenishment
of the cycle, which can be provided through oxidative
metabolism of glutamine [106]. Oxidation of glutamine in
the mitochondria begins with its conversion to glutamate
catalyzed by glutaminase (GLS). Glutaminase is a pivotal
enzyme in the regulation of glutamine metabolism in
tumor cells which has recently gathered some attention
as a promising target for cancer therapy [107-109]. There
are three mammalian glutaminase isoforms; kidney
(K-type) glutaminase (KGA) and glutaminase C (GAC)
are encoded by GLS and referred to as GLS1, while liver
(L-type) glutaminase (LGA) is encoded by GLS2 and
usually known as GLS2 [110]. Glutamate can be converted
to Î±-ketoglutarate by either glutamate dehydrogenase
(GDH) or transaminases, to feed the TCA cycle (Figure
2). In addition, glutamate can serve as a precursor of GSH
and non-essential amino acids such as aspartate, alanine,
proline and arginine. Interestingly, Î±-ketoglutarate levels
are determinant for the regulation of HIF1Î± degradation
through prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) sensing pathway [67,
94]. Furthermore, glutaminolysis and Î±-ketoglutarate are
also involved in the activation of mTOR signaling [68,
111]. Glutamine carbons can exit the TCA cycle in the
form of malate, which can be converted to pyruvate by
malic enzyme (ME) with NADPH generation [112]. Both
glutamine-derived NADPH and GSH production allow
tumor cells to reduce the oxidative stress associated with
mitochondrial respiration and rapid cell proliferation.
It is worth noting that glutamine utilization as a
respiratory substrate through the TCA cycle produces
NADH and FADH2 that provide electrons for the
mitochondrial electron transport chain to generate ATP
(Figure 2). Remarkably, glycolytic contribution to total
ATP synthesis in tumor cells differs widely depending on
cell type, from over 60% to less than 1%, with a mean
contribution of 17Â±18% in the tested cell lines [113].
These results are confirmed by a flux balance analysis

Glutamine metabolism
Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in
plasma and in intracellular pools, being consumed at
significantly higher rates than other amino acids by tumor
cells [82]. Glutamine plays several cellular key roles as
a nitrogen donor for nucleotide and protein synthesis,
as a carbon source for energy production and lipid
biosynthesis, and as a precursor for some non-essential
amino acids and the antioxidant GSH biosynthesis [82,
98]. Despite being a non-essential amino acid, glutamine
is crucial for the proliferation of most cells and for
the viability of some tumor cells that have developed

across the NCI-60 cell lines [78, 114] which shows that
oxidative phosphorylation contributes to 70-84% of the
total cellular ATP production [115]. Therefore, oxidative
metabolism of glutamine is the major energetic source in
many cancer cell lines.
Together, glucose and glutamine are the two
principal nutrients to coordinately fuel the proliferation
of tumor cells by supplying not only ATP but also key
precursors for protein, lipid and nucleic acid biosynthesis
(Figures 1 and 2). In fact, some cancer cells can switch
their carbon source in response to nutrient availability.
For example, glucose withdrawal increases GDH activity
in MYC-transformed glioblastoma cells [116], while
impairing the oxidative metabolism of glutamine by
silencing glutaminase induces a compensatory anaplerotic
mechanism catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase (PC) that
enables the use of glucose-derived pyruvate for anaplerosis
[117]. However, the metabolic compensation adopted by
tumor cells renders them absolutely dependent on the
new upregulated pathways, opening new opportunities
for cancer combined therapies. Therefore, the metabolic
flexibility and compensatory abilities exhibited by
some tumor cells have to be carefully considered when
designing cancer therapies.

of the re-engineering of intracellular signaling pathways
that are altered by mutations in oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes. In fact, most cancers harbor activating
mutations of oncogenes and/or inactivating mutations
of tumor suppressor genes which determine the tumor
metabolic phenotype and support tumorigenesis by giving
to transformed cells a proliferative advantage over nonmalignant cells. Several oncogenes including MYC,
hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1), phosphoinositide-3kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PBK or Akt) and the
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), have been
known to be involved in the regulation of tumor metabolic
reprogramming [5, 20, 92].

MYC as a master regulator of tumorigenesis
The MYC oncogene belongs to the MYC family of
genes together with MYCN and MYCL. However, MYC
is the only isoform ubiquitously expressed in a broad
range of tissues, while MYCN and MYCL are normally
only expressed during development [122]. MYC is a
multi-functional transcription factor that exerts control
over cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell
growth, metabolism, apoptosis, differentiation and stress
response through transcriptional regulation of its target
genes [122, 123]. In fact, MYC binds to the promoter
of 10-15% of all known genes, regulating both genes
encoding proteins and those encoding non-coding RNA
products of several functional classes [122, 124]. MYC
expression is dysregulated in many human cancers by
either chromosomal translocation or gene amplification.
In addition, the expression and stability of MYC protein
and MYC mRNA can also be dysregulated, promoting
tumorigenesis through unrestricted cell proliferation,
inhibition of cell differentiation, metabolic adaptation,
angiogenesis, reduction of cell adhesion and genomic
instability [122, 123, 125, 126].
To function as a transcription factor, MYC protein
heterodimerizes with its binding partner MAX, forming
an activated complex that recognizes E box sequences
(CACGTG) and induces the transcription of its targets
genes. MYC can also act as transcriptional repressor
by binding to MIZ1 or SP1 transcription factors and
interfering with their transcriptional activity [127]. It is
worth noting that multiple genes that are repressed by
MYC encode negative regulators of cell proliferation
such as CDKN2B (encoding p15INK4b), CDKN2C (p18INK4c),
CDKN1A (p21Cip1), CDKN1B (p27Kip1), and CDKN1C
(p57Kip2) [127]. MAX can also bind to MAD1, MXI1,
MAD3, MAD4 and MNT or form homodimers, repressing
the transcriptional activation of MYC target genes [128].

Glutamine reductive carboxylation
There are two different glutamine-dependent
pathways for fatty acid biosynthesis. On the one
hand, cells can oxidatively metabolize glutaminederived Î±-ketoglutarate to citrate in the TCA cycle
and subsequently transport it to the cytosol to generate
oxaloacetate and lipogenic acetyl-CoA [62]. Likewise,
malate produced from glutamine in the TCA cycle can
generate pyruvate through the action of malic enzyme,
which can be further metabolized to lipogenic acetylCoA. On the other hand, Î±-ketoglutarate obtained
from glutamine can be directly converted to citrate by
reductive carboxylation, especially in tumor cells under
hypoxic conditions or when mitochondrial respiration
is impaired, in order to sustain cell growth under these
circumstances [118-121]. This reaction takes advantage of
the reversible transformation catalyzed by aconitase and
isocitrate dehydrogenase. The cytosolic NADP+/NADPHdependent isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is the main
enzyme catalyzing the reversible reductive carboxylation
of Î±-ketoglutarate to isocitrate and NADP+ [118] (Figure
2). Indeed, reductive carboxylation of glutamine provides
a glucose-independent pathway to generate acetyl-CoA for
biosynthesis, allowing cells to conserve glucose for the
production of biosynthetic precursors that are specifically
generated from glucose [118].

ONCOGENIC REGULATION OF TUMOR

MYC is known to enhance glycolysis through the
activation of glycolytic genes (such as HK2, GAPDH,
ENO1 and PK, among others) and glucose transporters

(SLC2A1, SLC2A2 and SLC2A4) [129, 130]. In addition,
MYC promotes lactate production and export, increasing
the gene expression of LDHA and lactate transporter
MCT1 [126, 131, 132]. Figure 3 illustrates the main
metabolic pathways regulated by MYC.

On the other hand, transformed cells exhibit
increased MYC-dependent glutaminolysis and glutamine
dependency [22, 73]. Indeed, MYC has been described
as the main oncoprotein responsible for inducing a
transcriptional program that promotes glutaminolysis and

triggers cellular addiction to glutamine as a bioenergetic
substrate [22]. This glutamine addiction leads tumor
cells to reprogram intermediate metabolism for the
maintenance of mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle integrity [22]. Moreover, high levels of MYC
promote mitochondrial biogenesis and function, both
increasing the rate of oxygen consumption and the energy
production required for rapid cell proliferation [125,
133-135]. High glutaminolysis rate results in the robust
production of NADPH, which is needed to fulfill the
requirements for cell proliferation [22, 112]. In conditions
of low glucose and oxygen availability, MYC-induced
glutamine catabolism is important for cell survival [108].
Furthermore, cells with supraphysiological levels of MYC
are more sensitive to inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative
metabolism [136]. Moreover, MYC is also found to
contribute to increase glutamine uptake by upregulation
of the expression of glutamine transporters (ASCT2
[SLC1A5] and SLC7A5) [73, 85]. Importantly, MYC
enhances glutaminolysis by transcriptionally repressing
miR-23a and miR-23b (microRNA-23a/b), resulting in
greater expression of their target protein, glutaminase
(GLS1) [73]. In fact, GLS1 is the first enzyme in the
glutaminolysis and catalyzes the conversion of glutamine
to glutamate for its oxidation in the TCA cycle and also
for protein or glutathione synthesis. It is worth mentioning
that MYC can stimulate the use of the TCA cycle to
generate intermediates for macromolecular synthesis
using both glucose and glutamine as carbon source [98,
108]. However, it has been reported that cells presenting
high MYC levels greatly rely on mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation and increase glutaminolysis by 2- to
4-fold, while only moderately increasing glycolysis by
1.2-fold [137].
Additionally, MYC has been shown to activate
nucleotide biosynthesis by inducing several gens
involved in nucleotide metabolism including carbamoylphosphate synthase / aspartate carbamoyltransferase
/ dihydroorotase (CAD), CTP synthase 1 (CTPS) and
ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) [129, 132, 138, 139].
Polyamine biosynthesis is also regulated by MYC since
ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (the rate-limiting enzyme
in polyamine production) [138], adenosylmethionine
decarboxylase (AMD1) and spermidine synthase (SRM)
have E boxes in their regulatory region and are enhanced
in MYC-expressing cells [132]. Furthermore, polyamines
stimulate MYC transcription in a positive feedback loop
[140, 141].
Moreover, MYC can redirect glycolytic flux from
3-phosphoglycerate for the synthesis of serine and glycine
involving folate metabolism, which are essential for
purine and thymidylate biosynthesis [85, 132, 142, 143].
MYC is also implicated in proline metabolism regulation
by transcriptionally repressing proline oxidase/proline
dehydrogenase (POX/PRODH) expression through
upregulation of miR-23b*, and increasing the expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the enzymes of proline biosynthesis pathway (P5C
synthase, P5CS and P5C reductase 1, PYCR1) [70].
MYC and cell cycle
The network of MYC target genes suggests
its implication in the fulfillment of the metabolic
requirements for cell cycle entry [136, 144]. In fact, one
of the earliest observations after MYC discovery was
its ability to promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell
differentiation [129]. Remarkably, MYC overexpression
in quiescent cells is sufficient to trigger cell cycle entry,
reduce the requirement for growth factors, block cell cycle
exit, and increase cell size [145, 146]. MYC promotes
cell cycle progression by regulation of pivotal cell cycle
control genes through transcriptional induction of CDKs
and cyclins, and repression of CIP/KIP proteins. MYC
mediates the increase of active cyclin-CDK complexes
levels not only by upregulation of CDK1, CDK2, CDK4
(one of the principal MYC target genes [147]), CDK6,
CCND1 (encoding cyclin D1), CCND2 (cyclin D2),
CCND3 (cyclin D3), CCNE1 (cyclin E1), CCNE2 (cyclin
E2), CCNA2 (cyclin A2) and CCNB1 (cyclin B1), but
also by induction of CDC25A (CDKs phosphatase) and
CDK activating kinase complex (CAK, through enhanced
mRNA translation of its subunits, CDK7, cyclin H and
MAT1), and repression of the CDK inhibitory kinase
WEE1 through miR-221 activation [122, 126, 129, 145,
148]. Moreover, MYC abrogates the transcription of cell
cycle checkpoint genes GADD45 and GADD153 [122,
148], and impairs the activity of the CDK inhibitors
p27Kip1, p21Cip1 and p15INK4b through several mechanisms
[122, 126, 129, 145]. One of the most studied mechanisms
for p21Cip1 and p15INK4b MYC-mediated repression is the
binding to MIZ1 and the blocking of its transcriptional
activity [129, 145]. In contrast, MYC antagonizes p27Kip1
function by several parallel mechanisms such as induction
of miR-221 and miR-222, activation of E2F transcription
factors, increase of CDK4/6-cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E
complexes levels, and enhancement of the expression of
several components of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex
[122, 145]. Last but not least, MYC further stimulates cell
cycle progression by inducing genes directly involved
in DNA replication including MCM (minichromosome
maintenance), ORC (origin recognition complex),
CDC6 (cell division cycle 6), TERT (telomerase reverse
transcriptase) and the genes encoding three subunits of the
APC/C (ANAPC5, CDC16 and CDC23) [145].
MYC regulation
Given its pivotal role on cell fate, MYC expression
is tightly regulated at transcriptional, post-transcriptional
and post-translational levels in non-transformed cells.
Accordingly, dysregulation of MYC expression is one
of the most common abnormalities in human diseases,
being MYC overexpression frequently found in most
human cancers. Remarkably, MYC oncogenic activation

translocation and gene amplification mechanisms, while
most oncogenes are activated by mutations in their coding
sequence [122].
MYC protein presents extremely short half-life
(in the order of 20-30 minutes [149]) in the absence of
mitogenic signals, but is transiently stabilized upon cell
cycle entry and RAS activation, allowing its accumulation
[150, 151]. RAS promotes MYC stability through RAF/
MEK/ERK kinase cascade and via glycogen synthase
kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) inhibition by the PI3K/Akt pathway
[150, 152]. MYC turnover is regulated by the ubiquitin
proteasome pathway [149, 153] and is dependent on
the phosphorylation of two highly conserved residues
located near the N-terminal region of MYC, Thr58 and
Ser62. These phosphorylation sites exert opposing
control effects on MYC degradation [150]. ERK
(extracellular receptor kinase) phosphorylates MYC
on Ser62, promoting its protein accumulation, while
phosphorylation of Thr58, which is mediated by GSK-3Î²
but dependent on prior Ser62 phosphorylation, triggers
MYC proteasomal degradation [150-152, 154]. Therefore,
MYC phosphorylation at Ser62 has two opposite roles;
MYC stabilization and accumulation, and activation
of the subsequent phosphorylation at Thr 58, triggering
MYC degradation. Interestingly, proteasome inhibition
studies reveal that the accumulated poly-ubiquitinated
MYC only exhibits phosphorylation on Thr58 [152, 154].
Since phosphorylation on Ser62 is required prior to Thr58
phosphorylation, the Ser62 phosphate is removed before
MYC ubiquitination by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
action, contributing to MYC degradation [150, 152, 154].

In non-transformed cells, growth stimuli lead to
RAS activation and MYC protein synthesis. However,
when mitogenic signaling ends, RAS and PI3K activities
decline and release GSK-3Î² from its negative regulation,
activating its kinase activity and thus promoting MYC
degradation by phosphorylation on Thr58 [154]. The
ordered phosphorylation of Ser62 and Thr58 followed by
Ser62 dephosphorylation allows a tight control of MYC
protein levels. Hence, the disruption of the physiological
regulation of MYC expression can lead to malignancy.

HIF1
The hypoxia inducible factors HIF1, HIF2 and
HIF3 are the principal regulators of the transcriptional
homeostatic responses to situations of limited availability
of oxygen. HIF1 is ubiquitously expressed while HIF2
and HIF3 are only expressed in certain tissues [155]. Only
HIF1 and HIF2 are further discussed in this section since
HIF3 function is less well understood. The HIF factors
are composed of an oxygen-dependent HIFÎ± subunit and
a constitutively expressed HIFÎ² subunit. HIF activity
is tightly regulated by cycles of synthesis and oxygendependent proteasomal degradation. Indeed, HIFÎ±
subunits are continuously synthesized and their stability is
regulated by oxygen availability [155]. Under normoxic
conditions, HIFÎ± subunits are hydroxylated on proline
residues in the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD)
domain by prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (PHDs) and
subsequently ubiquitinated by the tumor suppressor protein

Figure 4: HIF1Î± regulation under normoxia. In the presence of oxygen and Î±-ketoglutarate, HIF1Î± subunits are hydroxylated on

proline residues in the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain by prolyl hydroxylases (principally prolyl hydroxylase 2, PHD2).
Prolyl hydroxylation is required for the binding of the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), which recruits an ubiquitin ligase complex
(E3) that ubiquitinates HIF1Î±. Ubiquitination marks HIF1Î± for proteasomal-mediated degradation. HIF, hypoxia inducible factor; OH,

von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) prior to their degradation in
the proteasome [155, 156] (Figure 4). Under hypoxic
conditions, the reduced molecular oxygen levels decrease
the activity of PHDs, which are further inactivated through
the oxidation of the ferrous ion within their active sites by
ROS released from inefficient mitochondrial respiration
[157], thus preventing their interaction with VHL [156].
Consequently, stable HIFÎ± subunits form heterodimers
with HIFÎ² subunits and translocate to the nucleus, where
they bind to specific consensus sequences (hypoxia
response element, HRE) in the promoter of hypoxiaresponsive genes for the transcriptional activation of the
cellular adaptation to hypoxia [158].

presence of oxygen [93]. In fact, deficiency of succinate
dehydrogenase has been demonstrated to increase
succinate levels and competitively inhibit PHDs under
normoxia, leading to HIF1Î± stabilization in a pseudohypoxic phenotype [93]. Interestingly, PHD activity can be
rescued by artificially increasing cellular Î±-ketoglutarate
levels both in normoxia, reversing the succinate-mediated
HIF1Î± stabilization [165], and hypoxia, resulting in
the destabilization of HIF1Î± and reversing the hypoxic
phenotype [166]. Therefore, PHD activity is regulated not
only by oxygen availability, but also by the availability
of Î±-ketoglutarate, a metabolite which plays a central
role in numerous metabolic processes and is closely
connected to amino acid metabolism [94]. In fact, both
intracellular Î±-ketoglutarate levels and PHD activity are
highly dependent on amino acid availability, while amino
acids ability to induce mTORC1 signaling requires PHD
enzymatic activity [167].
It is worth noting that, in addition to the principal
mechanism regulating HIF1Î± stability in response to
oxygen availability involving PHD and VHL, there
are also oxygen-independent pathways regulating the
synthesis and degradation of HIF1Î±, which involve
RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1) protein binding
to HIF1Î±, recruitment of an ubiquitin ligase complex and
consequent HIF1Î± proteasome-mediated degradation [158,
168].

Hypoxia and cancer
Solid tumors frequently develop hypoxia when
highly proliferating tumor cells outgrow their vascular
network, resulting in tumors with limited oxygen diffusion.
In order to adapt to the hypoxic microenvironment
and support cell survival, cells principally initiate
response mechanisms through HIFÎ± stabilization and
accumulation, favoring angiogenesis, invasion and
metabolic reprogramming [159, 160]. Accordingly, HIFÎ±
levels are increased in many human cancers and correlate
with poor clinical prognosis [160]. It is worth mentioning
that tumor cells can exhibit augmented levels of HIF1Î±
under normoxic conditions, a phenomenon known as
pseudo-hypoxia [159]. For example, induction of RAS
or SRC oncogenic signaling promotes normoxic HIF1Î±
accumulation through prolyl hydroxylation inhibition
[161].

HIF transcriptional targets
HIF1Î± and HIF2Î± overlap in their ability to activate
target genes involved in angiogenesis, metastasis and
invasion, while HIF1Î± alone regulates several glycolytic
and apoptotic genes and HIF2Î± preferentially promotes the
transcription of certain genes such as vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) or transforming growth factor Î±
(TGFÎ±) [155, 159, 164, 169].
HIF1 activation increases oxygen and nutrients
supply to tumors through angiogenesis and erythropoiesis
stimulation by VEGF and erythropoietin (EPO)
upregulation, respectively [21]. In addition, as part of
the molecular mechanisms associated with the Warburg
effect, HIF1 enhances glycolysis and lactate production
by transactivating glucose transporters and glycolytic
enzymes [170]. In accordance with the increased aerobic
glycolysis, HIF1 prevents the mitochondrial oxidation of
pyruvate, the final product of glycolysis, by inhibiting
the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) through
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1) induction
[171]. Furthermore, HIF1 enhances electron transport
chain efficiency through cytochrome c oxidase subunit
IV, isoform 2 (COX4I2) induction, which replaces the less
efficient isoform 1 (COX4I1), resulting in increased ATP
production and reduced ROS generation [172]. In addition
to the catabolic process of anaerobic glycolysis, HIF1 also
endorses anabolic processes such as glycogen synthesis
by upregulating the enzymes involved in its biosynthetic

Regulation of HIF by prolyl hydroxylases
In humans, there are three different members of
the prolyl hydroxylase family; PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3.
However, only PHD2 has been confirmed to be involved
in the oxygen regulation of HIF1Î±, while PHD1 and PHD3
display only partial additive effects on HIF1Î± stability
[162]. These enzymes are good oxygen sensors since
their affinity for oxygen is low with Km values from 230
to 250 ÂµM, slightly above the concentration of oxygen
in the air (200 ÂµM) [163]. PHDs require Î±-ketoglutarate,
oxygen and a prolyl residue as substrates, and iron and
ascorbate as cofactors, to produce a hydroxyl-prolyl
residue, succinate and CO2 [94]. Prolyl hydroxylation is
required for the recognition and binding of VHL to the
ODD domain, which recruits an ubiquitin ligase complex
[158] (Figure 4). Chemical inhibitors of the activity
of PHD, such as iron chelators (e.g. desferrioxamine,
DFO) or competitors of Î±-ketoglutarate for binding at
the hydroxylase (e.g. dimethyloxalylglycine, DMOG),
prevent the hydroxylation of HIFÎ± subunits, causing their
accumulation and promoting the expression of HIF target
genes [164]. Remarkably, the use of Î±-ketoglutarate as
an electron donor in the reaction of hydroxylation results
in its oxidation into succinate, which is an end product
whose accumulation can inhibit PHD activity even in the

at Thr308 and Ser473 [187, 188]. Since constitutive
activation of Akt is frequently found in human tumors,
being a central node in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, it
is potentially interesting to molecularly target components
of this pathway for cancer therapy [188].
Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are
direct targets of Akt that modulate cell cycle, growth,
DNA repair, survival, apoptosis, metabolism, cellular
differentiation, resistance to oxidative stress and tumor
suppressor pathways [189-193]. Four different FOXO
proteins are encoded in mammalian cells; FOXO1,
FOXO3a and FOXO4, which are ubiquitously expressed,
and FOXO6, which is expressed predominantly in
neural cells [194, 195]. Post-translational modifications
such as phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination
regulate the translocation of FOXO proteins to the
nucleus [196] where they activate transcription by
binding to gene regulatory regions [197]. The principal
mechanism of FOXO transcriptional regulation is FOXO
phosphorylation by Akt which impairs its DNA binding
activity and promotes its interaction with the chaperone
protein 14-3-3. This interaction triggers the nuclear
exclusion, cytoplasmic accumulation and ubiquitinproteasome pathway-dependent degradation of FOXO
factors, and promotes cell survival [198, 199]. In the
presence of oxidative stress, FOXO proteins are activated
and released from 14-3-3 through Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK) signaling [189, 191, 200, 201] (Figure 5).
FOXM1 transcription factor is a crucial regulator
of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression that
is overexpressed in many types of cancer. Cell
differentiation, angiogenesis, senescence, DNA damage
repair and tissue homeostasis are regulated by FOXM1,
conferring oncogene-like properties to this forkhead
subfamily member [202]. Recent studies have reported
that FOXO3a represses FOXM1 expression and that they
both compete for binding to similar DNA sequences,
sharing numerous target genes but being antagonists [196,
203-205]. It is worth noting that FOXO3a and FOXM1
proteins are indirect targets of several conventional and
widely used cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs such as
cisplatin or gefitinib, which mediate their effects through
FOXO3a activation and FOXM1 indirect repression via
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibition [206-211]. The
dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a axis may lead
to drug resistance by enhancing DNA repair, as well
as cancer cell maintenance, proliferation and survival
through overexpression of FOXM1 [196, 202].
A hallmark of most cancers where the PI3K/Akt
pathway is hyperactivated is the inactivation of FOXO
proteins [188, 201], postulating FOXO family members
as tumor suppressors [212]. Accordingly, PI3K depletion
results in FOXO proteins activation, induction of
apoptosis, decrease of cell viability and G1 cell cycle arrest
with inhibition of CDK4/6, cyclin D and accumulation of
p27Kip1 [213]. Indeed, in vivo models of loss of FOXO

HIF1 effects on MYC
There is a complex interplay between HIF1 and
MYC proteins concerning glucose metabolism and
mitochondrial function [131, 156, 176]. Both HIF1 and
MYC share common metabolic target genes such as
SLC2A1 glucose transporter, HK, phosphofructokinase
(PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) or LDH, among others [131].
In contrast, SLC2A3 glucose transporter is a specific HIF1
target gene [131]. On the other hand, HIF1 and MYC
have opposing effects on cell proliferation, mitochondrial
biogenesis and DNA repair [176]. HIF1 impairs
mitochondrial biogenesis and oxygen consumption by
inhibiting MYC-mediated transcription and inducing
MYC degradation [134], while regulates cell cycle and
DNA repair genes by functionally counteracting MYC
through displacement of MYC inhibitory binding from the
CDKN1A promoter [177] and of MYC activating binding
from MSH2 and MSH6 promoters [178]. Remarkably,
HIF1 directly inhibits MYC through induction of MXI1,
which binds to MAX and represses MYC transcriptional
activity, and through promotion of MYC proteasomal
degradation [134, 179]. Indeed, HIF increases MYC
phosphorylation at Thr58, triggering MYC ubiquitination,
and decreases the de-ubiquitinating enzyme USP28,
promoting MYC proteasome-dependent degradation
[180]. On the other hand, MYC induces MCM3 and
MCM5 proteins [145] which in turn inhibit HIF1 activity
by stimulating HIF1Î± hydroxylation, ubiquitination and
degradation [181, 182]. However, prolonged hypoxic
conditions reduced MCM mRNA expression in a HIF1dependent manner, indicating that MCM and HIF1 display
antagonistic functions [181, 182]. Interestingly, HIF1
and MYC present sirtuin-mediated shared regulation
mechanisms since sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) works in conjunction
with both transcription factors while SIRT6 inhibit
their transcriptional activity via effects on chromatin
[183]. Moreover, dual deficiency of oxygen and glucose
suppresses HIF signaling [184] and enhances MYC
degradation in cancer cells as an adaptive response to
survive under conditions of deficient energy sources [185].

The PI3K/Akt pathway
Overactivation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt signaling is commonly observed in human
cancers, as it is essential for cell proliferation, growth,
survival and metabolic reprogramming [186]. PI3Ks are
a family of lipid kinases that integrate prosurvival signals
such as growth factors, cytokines, hormones and other
environmental cues, translating them into intracellular
signals that activate Akt-dependent and Akt-independent
downstream signaling pathways [186]. Akt is a serinethreonine protein kinase that is mainly regulated following
PI3K activation and through sequential phosphorylation

proteasomal degradation [220]. Interestingly, FOXO3amediated regulation of MYC at different levels enables
both acute inhibition of mitochondrial gene expression
by MYC degradation and sustained inhibition through
MXI1 antagonistic effects [222]. Therefore, the inhibition
of the transcriptional activity of FOXO proteins by Aktmediated phosphorylation is required for MYC-induced
cell proliferation and transformation [219].
FOXO3a is induced under hypoxic conditions
as a direct target gene of HIF1 to mediate the hypoxic
repression of nuclear-encoded genes with mitochondrial
function by directly antagonizing MYC at their
promoters, resulting in reduced mitochondrial mass,
oxygen consumption and ROS production [223, 224].
Additionally, FOXO3a promotes cell survival both in
hypoxic tumor cells and hypoxic tumor tissue in vivo,
in contrast with its role as a tumor suppressor under
normoxic conditions [212, 223]. On the other hand,
FOXO3a prevents HIF1Î± stabilization by blocking the
hypoxia-induced ROS increase [220], and inhibits HIF1Î±

HIF1Î±-induced apoptosis during hypoxic stress and
promoting cell survival [224].
In response to energy stress, FOXO proteins inhibit
the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
signaling through induction of BCL2/adenovirus E1B
19kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) expression, which
in turn negatively regulates the mTORC1 activator RHEB
and the BCL2 pro-survival family members, resulting
in energy stress-induced apoptosis [225]. In addition,
mTORC1 inhibition upregulates FOXO3a expression and
nuclear accumulation through FOXO3a demethylation

function exhibit spontaneous tumor formation, while
FOXO overexpression can inhibit tumorigenesis [191,
211, 212, 214-216]. Even though FOXO transcription
factors are considered to be tumor suppressors, genetic
inactivation of FOXO is not often found in human cancers,
being predominantly repressed through overactivation of
the PI3K/Akt pathway caused by mutations in RAS, PTEN
or PI3K genes [212]. Therefore, the search for compounds
that promote activation and relocalisation of FOXO from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus is a promising therapeutic
approach for cancer treatment and overcoming drug
resistance [215, 217].
FOXO effects on MYC, HIF1Î± and mTOR
Activated PI3K/Akt pathway stimulates cell growth
and proliferation, and stabilizes MYC through inhibition
of GSK3Î² by preventing MYC phosphorylation at Thr58
[154]. Active PI3K and MYC specifically cooperate
in dysregulation of cell growth and proliferation, since
both regulate a common set of cellular processes [218].
Conversely, activation of FOXO transcription factors
following inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling represses
multiple MYC target genes including those involved in
cell proliferation and mitochondrial activity, blocking
MYC-mediated cell proliferation and transformation,
and reducing ROS production [219, 220]. In addition,
FOXO3a induces the expression of the MAD/MXD
family of transcriptional repressors, although MXI1 is
the only member that is its direct target. Indeed, MXI1 is
necessary for efficient inhibition of MYC transcriptional
activity [221]. Furthermore, FOXO3a activation
considerably reduces MYC protein levels by enhancing
phosphorylation of MYC at Thr58, which triggers its

Figure 5: FOXO regulation by growth factors and oxidative stress. Growth factors activate PI3K/Akt pathway, resulting in

FOXO factors phosphorylation, impairment of FOXO binding activity to DNA and promotion of FOXO interaction with the chaperone
protein 14-3-3, which in turn causes FOXO nuclear exclusion, cytoplasmic accumulation and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-dependent
degradation. Oxidative stress activates Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, which phosphorylates both FOXO (at other regulatory sites
than Akt) and 14-3-3 proteins, triggering the release of FOXO factors, their nuclear translocation and their transcriptional activity. Akt/

[226]. Conversely, mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)
phosphorylates the Class IIa histone deacetylases
(HDACs) in an Akt-independent manner, resulting in
FOXO acetylation, release of MYC proteins from FOXOmediated repression and the consequent conferral of
resistance to PI3K and Akt Inhibitors [227].

autophagy and metabolism [228]. In fact, the dysregulation
of mTOR-dependent cellular homeostasis maintenance is
associated with several human diseases such as cancer and
considerable research efforts have been made to efficiently
inhibit mTOR signaling [229, 230].
mTOR forms two functionally and structurally
different multiprotein complexes named mTOR complex
1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 activity
is regulated by growth factors, oxygen and nutrient
availability. Activation of PI3K/Akt and RAS/RAF/
ERK pathways by growth factors results in Akt- and
ERK-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of the
heterodimer tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)/TSC2, which is a
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates
mTORC1 through inhibition of the RAS homolog enriched
in brain (RHEB) GTPase [231]. Remarkably, intracellular

mTOR
The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR,
formerly mammalian TOR) is a conserved cytoplasmic
serine-threonine protein kinase that acts as a central cell
growth regulator by sensing mitogens, energy and amino
acids. mTOR pathway regulates cell survival and growth
through modulation of some pivotal cellular processes
including protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis,

amino acids are necessary for the activation of mTORC1
since they activate the mechanism by which mTORC1 is
able to interact with and be activated by RHEB [67].
Activated mTORC1 signaling cascade initiates
with the direct phosphorylation of the regulators of
translation eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E
(eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and S6 kinase 1
(S6K1), which promote protein synthesis [232]. In
addition, mTORC1 regulates lipid homeostasis through
activation of the transcription factors sterol regulatory
element-binding protein 1/2 (SREBP1/2), which in turn
control the expression of genes involved in fatty acid,
triglyceride, phospholipid and cholesterol synthesis [228,
233]. Interestingly, mTORC1 also promotes mitochondrial
biogenesis and the expression of genes involved in
oxidative metabolism [234, 235]. On the other hand,
mTORC2 pathway regulation and function remain poorly
understood. mTORC2 signaling is independent of nutrient
availability but is sensitive to PI3K signaling [228].
mTORC2 directly activates Akt through phosphorylation
of the Ser473 residue, which in turn activates mTORC1,
both situating mTOR upstream and downstream of Akt
[236]. It is worth noting that acute rapamycin treatment
specifically inhibits mTOR when it is part of mTORC1 but
not of mTORC2 [228, 229].

identification of other key players in the regulation of
the tumor metabolic reprogramming are fundamental
challenges for the development of new strategies for
cancer treatment.

THERAPEUTIC PERSPECTIVES
Targeting metabolic reprogramming in cancer
therapy
Development of malignancy is accompanied by
a complete metabolic reprogramming closely related
to the acquisition of most of cancer hallmarks [2, 28].
Many known genetic and epigenetic alterations converge
in a common adaptation of tumor cell metabolism
[30]. Indeed, metabolic properties of tumor cells are
significantly different from those of non-transformed
cells. In addition, tumor metabolic reprogramming is
linked to drug resistance in cancer treatment [243, 244].
Accordingly, metabolic adaptations are also involved in
different therapeutic approaches for cancer therapy. It is
worth noting that some of the first chemotherapeutical
agents used in cancer treatment were antimetabolites,
such as aminopterin, methotrexate or 5-fluorouracil, that
impaired the nucleotide synthesis and DNA replication
[245, 246]. From then on, numerous metabolic pathways
and enzymes have been successfully tested as anticancer
targets [247]. Since aerobic glycolysis is one of the
key metabolic features of cancer cells, many studies
are focused on inhibiting this pathway by blocking the
enzymes that control it [248]. Targeting the PPP with
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and oxythiamine to
respectively inhibit G6PD and TKT has also proven
to have antitumor effects [50, 244, 249]. Interestingly,
promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity with
dichloroacetate (DCA) presents promising results with
minor side effects in early phase clinical trials with
glioblastoma patients by suppressing angiogenesis,
increasing mitochondrial ROS, inducing apoptosis,
blocking HIF1 signaling and activating tumor suppressor
p53 [250-252]. In fact, DCA inhibits PDHK leading
to the metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative
phosphorylation through PDH reactivation [250].
Moreover, combined therapies with DCA and conventional
cancer therapeutics such as omeprazole and tamoxifen
show synergistic antitumor effects which can overcome
drug resistance [253]. Ongoing clinical trials with DCA as
a single agent or in combination with other therapeutics are
being conducted for patients with recurrent or metastatic
solid tumors and head and neck carcinoma (clinical trials
NCT00566410 and NCT01386632).
There is a growing interest on the development of
pharmacological strategies to inhibit tumor glutamine
metabolism. The use of amino acid analogues such as

mTOR regulation by hypoxia and MYC
Hypoxic oxygen levels inhibit mTORC1 by
activating the TSC1/TSC2 complex through two different
pathways. On the one hand, hypoxia reduces cellular
ATP levels and triggers 5â-AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) activation, which positively regulates TSC1/
TSC2 in a HIF1-independent manner [237]. On the other
hand, hypoxia activates TSC1/TSC2 by the transcriptional
induction of regulated in development and DNA damage
responses 1 (REDD1) gene, antagonizing other pathways
that promote growth through TSC1/TSC2 inhibition via
Akt [238, 239]. Hypoxia can also negatively regulate
mTORC1 through the hypoxia-inducible protein BNIP3
binding to RHEB, which inhibits the ability of RHEB
to activate mTORC1 [240]. Conversely, MYC acts
as a strong and direct repressor for TSC2 expression
by binding to its promoter, resulting in mTORC1
activation [241]. In addition, mTORC1 downstream
effector S6K1 phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation
factor eIF4B, enhancing MYC translation efficiency
and positively regulating glutaminase (GLS) and
glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) [101, 242]. Moreover,
glutaminolysis and Î±-ketoglutarate production, in response
to glutamine and leucine [68], also mediate mTORC1
activation [111].
In summary, mTOR, PI3K, HIF and MYC are key
regulators of cellular metabolism that are frequently
altered in cancer, collaborating in both synergistic
and antagonistic ways. A better understanding of the
relationship between these pathways as well as the

acivicin led to severe side effects in clinical trials, aiming
for more selective therapeutic strategies [254]. As a
result, GLS1 isoform has emerged as a promising target
for cancer therapy and several specific small molecule
inhibitors of GLS1 have recently been characterized.
Compound 968 and BPTES (bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide) are two allosteric
inhibitors of GLS1 that exhibit antitumor activities in
numerous pre-clinical studies and several tumor types
[100, 108, 121, 255-257]. Remarkably, the selective
inhibitor of GLS1 known as CB-839 presents in vitro
antiproliferative activity against acute myeloid leukemia
cells [258], and a panel of triple-negative breast cancer cell
lines, but not estrogen receptor (ER) or human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive cell lines, as
well as in vivo efficacy in breast cancer xenograft models
[107]. In addition, CB-839 has recently entered phase I
clinical trials without displaying central nervous system
toxicity (clinical trials NCT02071862 and NCT02071888).
In fact, GLS1 inhibition is a good strategy for tumor
cells that overexpress MYC and thus present glutamine
dependence [22, 99]. It is worth mentioning that, to date,
no effective MYC inhibitors have been developed despite
the fact that MYC overexpression is frequently found in
human cancers [125, 259-261]. However, targeting GLS1
significantly antagonizes the growth of tumors presenting
MYC overexpression and can be exploited as a novel
antitumor therapy [100].

Then, in order to select appropriate molecular
targets for inhibition or modification, is necessary to
first perform a tumor expression profiling to identify its
specific oncogenic signatures, and confirm that the target
is tumor specific, non-redundant, and able to influence
the outcome of tumor progression [263, 265]. However,
many oncogenic pathways cannot be directly targeted
with small-molecule inhibitors [260]. Remarkably, gene
expression analysis can be used as a predictive tool to
identify the oncogenic pathways which are dysregulated in
a specific tumor, providing a potential basis for guiding the
use of pathway-specific drugs and directing combination
therapies aimed to slow tumor growth and progression,
improve treatment response, and overcome therapeutic
resistance [265].

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The understanding of cancer cell biology is of
pivotal importance to identify biomarkers for early
diagnosis and design new therapeutic strategies. In
particular, tumor cells switch their core metabolism
to meet the increased requirements of cell growth and
division. Accordingly, oncogenic signals converge to
reprogram tumor metabolism by enhancing key metabolic
pathways such as glycolysis, PPP, glutaminolysis and
amino acid, lipid and nucleic acid metabolism [19, 63].
Therefore, tumor metabolic reprogramming is a direct
result of the re-engineering of intracellular signaling
pathways that are altered by activating mutations in
oncogenes, loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor
genes and epigenetic modifications, which finally gives
to transformed cells a proliferative advantage over nonmalignant cells [5, 6]. However, the final tumor phenotype
depends on the homeostatic nature of metabolism, since
metabolic rewiring is associated with compensatory
and regulatory adjustments. There are several levels of
metabolic adaptations, from changes in the concentrations
and fluxes associated with substrate-enzyme affinities
to adjustments coordinated by metabolite-based
regulatory loops or determined by changes in the activity
of regulatory proteins (e.g. MYC and HIF). In fact,
metabolic rewiring allows tumor cells to exhibit rapidly
adaptive responses to changes in tumor microenvironment,
promoting tumor progression and acquired resistance to
targeted therapeutics [266, 267]. On the other hand, tumor
metabolic adaptation after single-agent treatment can
reveal new cell dependences and vulnerabilities which,
in turn, may be potential candidates to be targeted in
combination therapies. The final aim of the combination
treatments is to achieve synergistic therapeutic effect,
dose and toxicity reduction, and to minimize or delay the
induction of drug resistance [268].
Personalized medicine in cancer requires the correct
diagnosis of cancer to give patients the most appropriate
treatment according to their individual circumstances and

Combination therapies
The identification of cytotoxic compounds has
led the development of antitumor therapeutics until in
the recent years chemotherapy advanced into the era of
molecularly targeted therapeutics [262]. The bases of
molecular targeted cancer therapy are to selectively kill
tumor cells while sparing non-malignant cells, and prevent
tumor resistance emergence and relapse [263]. However,
solid tumors response to targeted monotherapy is limited
and frequently associated with the development of drug
resistance. In addition, the design of targeted therapies
requires the definition of the activated oncogenic pathways
in transformed cells and the availability of selective
small-molecule inhibitors directed to these pathways. The
modest efficacy of current therapies is also caused by the
high degree of tumor clonal and genetic heterogeneity,
since inhibition of a single target does not necessarily
eradicate the tumor. Therefore, the use of combination
therapies of selective agents and/or cytotoxic agents that
inhibit two or more molecular targets in a single pathway,
or in parallel or compensatory pathways, is an attractive
strategy for cancer treatment [264]. Additionally, the
simultaneous inhibition of multiple targets or redundant
pathways is aimed at improving treatment efficacy and
overcoming and/or preventing the emergence of adaptive
resistance.

the molecular characteristics of their tumors. However,
personalized medicine is still at a relatively early stage
in its development, and therefore the classification of
cancers is based on critical molecular targets identified by
translational research. Hence, more efforts should be put
into understanding the tumor biology in order to identify
the involved targets and determine the optimum treatment
for each specific tumor. Likewise, the developing of
new therapeutic strategies that specifically target the
molecular pathways involved in promoting tumor cell
proliferation and survival, such as targeted therapies, is
a major focus of cancer research today [263]. However,
the currently available chemotherapeutic treatments
exhibit modest efficacy due to their side effects and
drug resistance [267]. In addition, the design of more
efficient targeted therapies requires a better definition of
the activated oncogenic pathways in transformed cells
and the availability of selective small-molecule inhibitors
directed to these pathways. In this context, the search for
combined chemotherapies with low systemic toxicity that
inhibit two or more molecular targets in a single pathway,
or in redundant or compensatory pathways, is a promising
strategy for cancer treatment [264]. With this purpose,
both metabolic tumor characterization and gene expression
analysis can be used to identify the dysregulated molecular
pathways in a specific tumor, providing a potential basis
for guiding the use of target-specific drugs and directing
combination therapies [265].
