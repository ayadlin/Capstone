Abstract
The induction of programmed cell death in premalignant or
malignant cancer cells by chemopreventive agents could be a
valuable tool to control prostate cancer initiation and
progression. In this work, we present evidence that the
C-28 methyl ester of the synthetic oleanane triterpenoid
2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me)
induces cell death in androgen-responsive and unresponsive
human prostate cancer cell lines at nanomolar and low
micromolar concentrations. CDDO-Me induced caspase-3,
caspase-8, and caspase-9 activation; poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage; internucleosomal DNA fragmentation; and
loss of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide reduction in PC3 and DU145 cells. However,
caspase-3 and caspase-8 inhibition by Z-DEVD-fmk and
Z-IETD-fmk, respectively, or general caspase inhibition by
BOC-D-fmk or Z-VAD-fmk did not rescue loss of cell viability
induced by CDDO-Me, suggesting the activation of additional
caspase-independent mechanisms. Interestingly, CDDO-Me
induced inactivating phosphorylation at Ser9 of glycogen
synthase kinase 3B (GSK3B), a multifunctional kinase that
mediates essential events promoting prostate cancer development and acquisition of androgen independence. The
GSK3 inhibitor lithium chloride and, more effectively, GSK3
gene silencing sensitized PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer
cells to CDDO-Me cytotoxicity. These data suggest that
modulation of GSK3B activation is involved in the cell death
pathway engaged by CDDO-Me in prostate cancer cells.

Introduction
Chemoprevention is an attractive approach to protect the male
population from prostate cancer onset and progression. Several
conditions predispose to prostate cancer, among which benign
hyperplasia, inflammation, and asymptomatic high prostatespecific antigen values. Prevention of this disease would have a
major effect on associated cost, morbidity, and mortality for a large
segment of the population. Several promising pharmacologic

agents, including finasteride (1), dutasteride, vitamin E, vitamin
D, selenium (2), cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (3), lycopene (4), and
more recently, green tea extracts (5), have undergone clinical
testing in chemoprevention trials to control the process of prostate
carcinogenesis. To develop new chemopreventive measures by
long-term administration of nontoxic drugs, it is essential to better
define the molecular pathogenesis of prostate cancer to target
tissue-specific molecular and cellular alterations related to prostate
cancer initiation and progression.
The novel chemopreventive synthetic triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) and its imidazolide
and methyl ester derivatives (CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me, respectively) were developed from the naturally occurring triterpene
oleanolic acid and are highly effective for the prevention and
treatment of cancer in animal models (6). These compounds
showed remarkable chemopreventive activity by targeting proinflammatory molecules (7–10) and by exerting antiproliferative and
proapoptotic effects in a wide range of tumor models (11–16).
CDDO triterpenoids have previously been reported to induce cell
death by disrupting redox balance, by increasing intracellular levels
of reactive oxygen species (14, 17, 18), and by activating caspase-8–
dependent (11–14, 16) and calcium-dependent cell death pathways
(15). Interestingly, CDDO also functions as a peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-g agonist (19), thus belonging to a class of
antidiabetic and antitumor molecules that have been shown to
effectively inhibit prostate tumor xenografts (20), whereas CDDOMe is a peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-g antagonist
(21). CDDO and CDDO-Me are currently in phase I clinical trials for
use in the treatment of leukemia and other malignancies refractory
to conventional therapies.
The AKT signaling pathway activated by survival factors
contributes to the progression of prostate cancer to androgen independence and resistance to androgen ablation therapy (22).
Remarkably, oncogenic overactivation of AKT determines a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia phenotype in transgenic mice (23).
Experimental data suggest that the AKT signaling pathway is
a target of several chemically different cancer chemopreventive
agents (24).
The AKT substrate glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is involved
in many biological processes including glucose metabolism and the
response to insulin and insulin-like growth factor I. GSK3 is a
ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase composed of two isoforms,
GSK3a and GSK3h. GSK3 activity is negatively regulated by
phosphorylation of GSK3a at Ser21 and GSK3h at Ser9 by AKT and
other kinases including protein kinase A and protein kinase C (25).
GSK3h has been reported to exert tumor suppressive activity by
inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell death in a wide
variety of stressful conditions (25). Recently, GSK3h inhibitory
phosphorylation by pharmacologic agents, such as lithium

chloride, has been shown to determine an apparently tissuespecific cell fate by inducing cell survival or cell death in different
tumor cell types (25). Notably, GSK3 has been linked to prostate
cancer progression (26).
To define the molecular targets and the mechanism of action of
the chemopreventive synthetic triterpenoids CDDO, CDDO-Im, and
CDDO-Me in prostate cancer cells, in this report we analyzed cell
death pathways and survival signaling downstream of AKT. In
particular, we show that CDDO-Me blocks cell proliferation and
induces caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activation and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP) cleavage in prostate cancer
cells. CDDO-Me enhanced GSK3h-inactivating phosphorylation,
whereas inactivation of GSK3 by pharmacologic inhibitors or RNA
interference sensitized prostate cancer cells to CDDO-Me cytotoxicity. These data indicate that CDDO-Me interferes with the
survival signals propagated downstream of AKT by targeting GSK3
activation.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and treatments. Androgen-independent PC3 and DU145
and androgen-dependent LNCaP human prostate adenocarcinoma cells
were obtained from the Interlab Cell Line Collection core facility of the
National Cancer Research Institute (IST) in Genova, and were propagated
in suspension in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
2 mmol/L glutamine, 100 mmol/L penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were
treated with CDDO, CDDO-Im, and CDDO-Me dissolved in DMSO in a
10 mmol/L stock solution and used at the final concentrations indicated
in the text and in figure legends. The caspase-3 inhibitor Z-Asp(OMe)Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH2F (Z-DEVD-fmk), the caspase-8 inhibitor
Z-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-CH2F (Z-IETD-fmk), the caspase-9 inhibitor
Z-Leu-Glu(OMe)-His-Asp(OMe)-CH2F (Z-LEHD-fmk), and the pan-caspase
inhibitors Boc-Asp(OMe)-CH2F (BOC-D-fmk) and Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)CH2F (Z-VAD-fmk), SB216763, and AR-A014418 were from Calbiochem.
Lithium chloride was from Sigma.
RNA interference. SignalSilence GSK3a/h or caspase-3 small interfering
RNAs (siRNA; Cell Signaling Technology) were used to specifically inhibit
GSK3a/h or caspase-3. PC3 and DU145 cells were transfected with the
target-specific and fluorescein-conjugated nontargeted control siRNA with
the TransIT-TKO Transfection Reagent provided by Mirus Bio, Corp.
Cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Cell viability was determined
by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
and crystal violet assays as previously described (27). Synthetic CDDO
triterpenoids dissolved in DMSO (0.1% final ethanol concentration) were
added to the cells and incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h at 37jC. Cytotoxicity
measurement by cell membrane lysis and release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium was carried out with the
colorimetric CytoTox 96 assay kit (Promega) following the instructions
of the manufacturers. The data obtained were expressed as percent LDH
release relative to total LDH in culture. ATP was determined luminometrically by the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability assay (Promega)
as described (28).
Detection of apoptosis by histone-associated DNA fragments.
Apoptotic cell death was determined by an enzyme-linked immunoassay
(Cell Death Detection ELISA PLUS, Roche) to detect fragmented DNA and
histones (mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes). Cell lysates prepared
from 3  104 cells seeded on 24-well plates and treated with CDDO, CDDOIm, and CDDO-Me in combination with different inhibitors for 24 h were
processed following the instructions of the manufacturer.
Western blotting of proteins. Total cell lysates and mitochondrial and
cytosolic fractions were prepared as previously described (28). Protein
quantitation was done with the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Forty
micrograms of total cellular proteins were resolved on 12.5% SDS
polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by
Western blotting. The membranes were then incubated with antibodies in

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

5% powdered skim milk, or bovine serum albumin where indicated,
dissolved in 25 mmol/L TBS containing 0.15 mol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20.
The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-human caspase3, caspase-8, caspase-9, phospho-AKT-1 (Ser473), AKT, phospho-GSK3h
(Ser9), GSK3h, full-length 116-kDa form, and 89-kDa cleavage fragment of
PARP (Asp214; Cell Signaling Technology); Bid (Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Novus Biologicals,
Inc.); and secondary horseradish peroxidase–labeled antirabbit or antimouse antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). The immunoreaction was
revealed by the ECL-Plus detection system (Amersham, GE Healthcare).
Caspase-3 activity assay. Protease activity for caspase-3/7 was
measured with the Caspase-Glo luminescent Assay (Promega) on 4  104
cells seeded in 96-well white-walled clear-bottom luminometer microplates.
Cells were treated with CDDO-Me for 6 and 24 h, with or without a
2-h preincubation with inhibitors. Cell lysates were incubated at room
temperature in the dark for 1 h with the luminogenic substrate Z-DEVDaminoluciferin. Luminescence was measured using a Luminoskan Ascent
luminometer (Thermo Electron Corp.). The amount of luminescence
detected was expressed as relative light units.
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean F SD. The statistical
significance between two data sets was determined by two-tailed unpaired
Student’s t test using the PRISM GraphPad software. One-way ANOVA
followed by the Tukey-Kramer test was used in the analysis of three or more
data sets.

Results
CDDO triterpenoids induce a dose- and time-dependent loss
of viability in prostate cancer cells. A remarkable decrease in
sensitivity to conventional anticancer agents is a hallmark of
prostate cancer cells on acquisition of androgen independence.
To investigate the response of prostate cancer cells to CDDO, CDDOIm, and CDDO-Me synthetic triterpenoids, the cell viability of
androgen-independent PC3 and DU145 and androgen-dependent
LNCaP prostate cancer cells was evaluated with the MTT assay on
exposure to different concentrations of the compounds (250 nmol/L,
500 nmol/L, and 1 Amol/L) for 24, 48, and 72 hours.
Time-dependent significant inhibition of cell viability was
observed for all triterpenoids, starting at 24 hours of treatment
(Fig. 1). CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me were the most effective
compounds, as compared with CDDO, in all the three cell lines
analyzed. IC50 at 24 hours with CDDO, CDDO Im, and CDDO-Me
was, respectively, 6, 1.2, and 1 Amol/L for PC3 cells; 8 Amol/L,
879 nmol/L, and 688 nmol/L for DU145 cells; and 1 Amol/L,
699 nmol/L, and 683 nmol/L for LNCaP cells. In LNCaP cells, a
viable population was observed at the later time points at all
concentrations used, indicating the existence of a subpopulation of
cells highly sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of all three
triterpenoids and of another subpopulation with a certain degree
of resistance to all three drugs. These cell viability assays were
flanked by other tests to assess cell toxicity, including release of
LDH to detect cell membrane damage and the crystal violet assay
for quantification of adherent, viable cells. CDDO-Me was the only
compound significantly affecting cell membrane integrity, inducing
dose- and time-dependent release of LDH that reached f80%
of total LDH at 72 hours in PC3 cells treated with CDDO-Me at
1 Amol/L, whereas the crystal violet assay confirmed loss of cell
viability detected with the MTT assay (data not shown). The data
obtained indicate that synthetic triterpenoids effectively decrease
the survival of androgen-responsive and unresponsive prostate
cancer cells at nanomolar and low micromolar concentrations that
have been proved to be effective in other tumor cell types (11–16)
and are achievable in vivo in animal models (6).

CDDO-Me–Induced Cell Death Targets GSK3

Figure 1. CDDO triterpenoids affect the cell viability of androgen-independent (PC3 and DU145) and androgen-dependent (LNCaP) prostate cancer cells. Prostate
cancer cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of CDDO, CDDO-Im, and CDDO-Me. The ability to reduce MTT was assayed 24, 48, and 72 h later and
expressed as percent relative to controls. CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me were the most effective compounds in the three cell lines tested. Points, mean from three
independent experiments run in sextuplicate; bars, SD.

Triterpenoids induce caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3
activation and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in
prostate cancer cells. Triterpenoids at the concentrations of
500 nmol/L and 1 Amol/L were administered to PC3, DU145, and
LNCaP cells in RPMI-10% FCS, and oligonucleosomal DNA
fragmentation, indicative of nuclear apoptosis, was evaluated after
24 hours of treatment. The doses used in these experiments were
selected on the base of data with the MTT assay showing a clear
reduction of tumor cell viability. The cancer-chemopreventive
synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4HPR) at 10
and 20 Amol/L was used for comparison. A 5-fold increase of
apoptotic cells relative to untreated controls was detectable in PC3
cells with CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me at 500 nmol/L, whereas CDDO
induced a minimal increase of apoptotic cells (Fig. 2). A stronger
response was obtained with CDDO-Me at high dose (1 Amol/L) in
all the three cell lines. In DU145 cells, DNA fragmentation was
induced to a lesser extent by all three triterpenoids, and maximal
levels were observed with CDDO-Im at 500 nmol/L and CDDO-Me
at 1 Amol/L. Decreased DNA fragmentation in DU145 and LNCaP
cells treated with 1 Amol/L CDDO-Im corresponded to remarkable
cell shrinkage and disintegration indicative of late-stage apoptosis
(data not shown). Noteworthy, a 20-fold higher concentration of

4HPR, used as a positive control, was needed to obtain a
comparable effect.
Owing to the great sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to CDDOMe, as assessed by the cell viability assays, we focused on this
compound for further investigations to define the cell death
pathways activated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.
CDDO-Me induces caspase-3– and caspase-8–dependent DNA
fragmentation and PARP cleavage, but caspase-independent
cytotoxicity, in PC3 cells. To characterize apoptotic cell death
activated by CDDO-Me in PC3 and DU145 cells, we examined
caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 processing by Western blotting
analysis. In some experiments, CDDO-Me at 2.5 Amol/L was
used; however, most investigations, in particular the biological
assays, were carried out with CDDO-Me at the maximal dose of
1 Amol/L to avoid excessive cell toxicity.
Specific antibodies were used that detect the full-length 32-kDa
proform and the large fragment of 17 kDa resulting from cleavage
of caspase-3, the full-length 57-kDa proform and 43-kDa fragment
of caspase-8, the full-length 52-kDa proform of caspase-9, the 89kDa fragment of PARP generated by caspase-3 cleavage, and
GAPDH for normalization. A dose-dependent processing of
procaspase-3, procaspase-8, and procaspase-9 in PC3 and DU145

Figure 2. CDDO triterpenoids induce oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in prostate cancer cells. Triterpenoids were administered to PC3 (A), DU145 (B), and
LNCaP (C ) cells (3  104) in RPMI-10% FCS, and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, indicative of nuclear apoptosis, was evaluated by ELISA after 24 h.
A 5-fold increase in apoptotic cells is detectable with CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me at 500 nmol/L. A stronger response is obtained with CDDO-Me at high dose (1 Amol/L).

cells was detected after 24 hours of treatment (Fig. 3A). The 17-kDa
and the 43-kDa cleavage fragments of caspase-3 and caspase-8,
respectively, were retained in some experiments (Fig. 3A, right) but
not in others (Fig. 3A, left); however, decreased amounts of the
full-length forms of caspases were reproducibly observed in
samples treated with CDDO-Me. Dose-dependent cleavage of the
caspase-3 substrate PARP was also evident, indicating the
activation of nuclear apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, release of
cytochrome c was observed in the cytosolic fractions of PC3 and
DU145 cells treated with 1 Amol/L CDDO-Me for 3 hours (Fig. 3B),
indicating mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.
To better correlate caspase activation with induction of
apoptotic cell death, we examined DNA fragmentation in PC3
cells treated with the caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk (10 Amol/L)
or the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk (10 Amol/L) for 2 hours,
followed by treatment with CDDO-Me (500 nmol/L–1 Amol/L)
for 24 hours. Pretreatment with caspase-3 and caspase-8 inhibitors
sharply decreased DNA fragmentation to control levels (Fig. 3C).
Accordingly, activation of caspase-3 induced by 1 Amol/L CDDOMe in PC3 cells (Fig. 3C) and DU145 cells (data not shown), which
was maximal at 6 hours of treatment, was suppressed by the
caspase-3 and caspase-8 inhibitors, by the caspase-9 inhibitor
Z-LEHD-fmk, and by the pan-caspase inhibitor BOC-D-fmk
(10 Amol/L), which irreversibly and specifically inhibits caspases
at this dose.
In contrast, Z-DEVD-fmk or Z-IETD-fmk was ineffective in
rescuing time-dependent loss of viability induced by CDDO-Me at
500 nmol/L (Fig. 3D) and 1 Amol/L (data not shown), as evaluated
with the MTT and crystal violet assays (Fig. 3D). Loss of viability in
PC3 and DU145 cells where caspase-3 expression was decreased
by siRNA for 48 hours and treated with CDDO-Me for 48 hours
(Fig. 3D) confirmed the activation of a cell death pathway partially
independent of caspase-3. Because caspase-3 gene silencing was
not complete, leaving the possibility that residual caspase-3 was
still active, and the participation of other executioner caspases
(e.g., caspase-6) could not be excluded, ATP levels were examined
to assess cell viability in the cells treated with 1 Amol/L CDDO-Me
and the general caspase inhibitors BOC-D-fmk or Z-VAD-fmk. ATP
depletion induced by CDDO-Me at 24 and 48 hours was not

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

rescued by Z-VAD-fmk or BOC-D-fmk, respectively, in DU145 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1A) and PC3 cells (data not shown).
In agreement with inhibition of DNA fragmentation, the
caspase-3 and caspase-8 inhibitors effectively reduced caspase-3
activation and PARP cleavage in PC3 and DU145 cells (Fig. 4A).
In particular, Z-IETD-fmk almost completely abolished PARP
cleavage in PC3 cells, whereas in cells treated with Z-DEVD-fmk
residual cleaved PARP confirmed the activation by CDDO-Me of
a caspase-3–independent mechanism, as previously reported in
prostate cancer cells (29). The full-length form of the caspase8 substrate Bid was decreased in PC3 and DU145 cells treated
with 1 Amol/L CDDO-Me and was preserved in the cells treated
with Z-IETD-fmk (Fig. 4A).
Taken together, these data suggest that caspase-3, caspase-8, and
caspase-9 activation controls nuclear apoptosis, as indicated by
DNA fragmentation, but a caspase-independent pathway contributes to CDDO-Me cytotoxicity in PC3 cells.
CDDO-Me increases inactivating phosphorylation of GSK3B
in prostate cancer cells. We considered the modulation of the
AKT signaling pathway as readout to monitor cell survival in
prostate cancer cells treated with CDDO-Me. Activation of AKT
was analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies directed
against the phosphorylated form of AKT at Ser473. We also analyzed
the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3h, an AKT target that is
involved not only in the survival response induced by growth
factors and inhibitors of mitochondrial apoptosis (25) but also in
cell death pathways activated in prostate cancer cells (30).
Phosphorylated AKT was detected in control PC3 and DU145
cells maintained in the presence of serum. AKT phosphorylation
was reproducibly reduced by 500 nmol/L CDDO-Me; it was almost
completely suppressed by 2.5 Amol/L CDDO-Me in PC3 cells, but
not in DU145 cells, and it was not significantly affected by the other
doses of CDDO-Me (Fig. 4B).
GSK3 is normally active (unphosphorylated) in unstimulated,
resting cells. GSK3h, as expected, was phosphorylated in PC3 and
DU145 control cells maintained in the presence of serum.
Surprisingly, GSK3h phosphorylation did not correlate with AKT
phosphorylation in PC3 cells treated with CDDO-Me; on the
contrary, it was increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B).

CDDO-Me–Induced Cell Death Targets GSK3

Similarly, apoptotic doses of CDDO-Me (1–2.5 Amol/L) induced
GSK3h phosphorylation in DU145 cells (Fig. 4A). Thus, in both PC3
and DU145 cells (Fig. 4B) and in LNCaP cells (data not shown)
treated with 1 and 2.5 Amol/L CDDO-Me, enhanced GSK3h

phosphorylation correlated with caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 processing and PARP cleavage, as shown in Fig. 3A.
Interestingly, GSK3h phosphorylation remained elevated and was
slightly enhanced in PC3 and DU145 cells treated with 1 Amol/L

Figure 3. CDDO-Me activates caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 and mitochondrial apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. A, dose-dependent caspase-3, caspase-8,

and the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk (10 Amol/L) effectively inhibits DNA fragmentation in PC3 cells treated with 500 nmol/L and 1 Amol/L CDDO-Me for 24 h
(top ). Specific or general caspase inhibition blocks caspase-3 activation induced by 1 Amol/L CDDO-Me at 6 h. The caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-fmk and the
pan-caspase inhibitor BOC-D-fmk were used at 10 Amol/L (bottom ). RLU, relative light units. D, time-dependent loss of viability induced by CDDO-Me (500 nmol/L),
as determined by the MTT assay, is not rescued by caspase-3 and caspase-8 inhibitors in PC3 cells. The crystal violet assay confirms the caspase-8–independent
cytotoxicity induced by CDDO-Me at 24 h in PC3 cells (top ). Caspase-3 gene silencing does not affect CDDO-Me cytotoxicity at 48 h in the MTT assay (bottom ).
The experiment was repeated thrice for every cell line. Columns, mean of at least three independent experiments run in sextuplicate; bars, SD.

Figure 4. A, effects of caspase-3 and caspase-8 inhibition by Z-DEVD-fmk (10 Amol/L) and Z-IETD-fmk (10 Amol/L), respectively, in PC3 and DU145 cells treated
with CDDO-Me at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. Note that caspase-3 and caspase-8 inhibition does not decrease GSK3h phosphorylation induced by
CDDO-Me. B, dose-dependent stimulation of GSK3h phosphorylation in PC3 and DU145 cells treated with CDDO-Me for 24 h. Modulation of AKT expression and
phosphorylation is significantly affected by 2.5 Amol/L CDDO-Me.

CDDO-Me and both caspase inhibitors Z-DEVD-fmk and Z-IETDfmk (Fig. 4A).
These data indicate that loss of viability in PC3 cells treated with
CDDO-Me and caspase inhibitors (Fig. 3D) is associated with
persistent GSK3h inactivation (Fig. 4A).
GSK3B plays a role in CDDO-Me–induced cell death. GSK3
inactivation can exert contrasting effects on cell survival depending
on the cell type and the nature of the stimulus. GSK3h-inactivating
phosphorylation at Ser9 is observed in proliferating cells and is
mainly dependent on AKT; conversely, pharmacologic inhibitors of
GSK3h can promote cell death in some tumor cell types (25, 30, 31).
Because loss of viability in PC3 cells (Fig. 3D) correlated with
increased GSK3h phosphorylation (Fig. 4A), we asked whether
CDDO-Me activates a cell death pathway involving GSK3, or GSK3
inhibition induced by CDDO-Me was mediating a reactive survival
response elicited by cell death activation (32).
The effects of GSK3h inhibition on prostate cancer cells were
investigated by using three different viability assays (MTT, LDH,
and crystal violet assays) and by examining DNA fragmentation. We
used lithium chloride, which inhibits GSK3h by acting as a
competitive inhibitor of Mg2+ and by inducing Ser9 autophosphorylation (33). The pan-caspase inhibitor BOC-D-fmk (10 Amol/L)
was included in these assays.
General caspase inhibition by BOC-D-fmk could not prevent loss
of viability induced by CDDO-Me in the MTT assay (Fig. 5A and B)
or in the crystal violet assay (data not shown) both in PC3 and in

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

DU145 cells, confirming the data obtained with specific caspase-3
and caspase-8 inhibitors and caspase-3 gene silencing (Fig. 3D).
Lithium chloride alone (50 mmol/L; ref. 34) remarkably affected
prostate cancer cell viability and induced a small but statistically
significant loss of viability in combination with CDDO-Me,
indicative of an additive, rather than synergistic, effect in the
MTT assay (Fig. 5A and B) and in the crystal violet assay
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). BOC-D-fmk did not improve viability in
the cells treated with lithium alone or in combination with CDDOMe (Fig. 5A and B). Similar results were obtained with specific
GSK3 inhibitors structurally unrelated to lithium ions, the small
molecules SB216763 (10 Amol/L) and AR-A014418 (25 Amol/L),
which act as competitive ATP inhibitors (data not shown; ref. 33).
Caspase-3 reduction by siRNA did not affect loss of viability
induced by lithium (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Nevertheless, lithium added 2 hours before CDDO-Me administration markedly increased caspase-3 processing and PARP cleavage in PC3 and DU145 cells treated with CDDO-Me for 24 hours,
paralleled by increased caspase-8 processing and enhanced cleavage of Bid (Fig. 5C), suggesting that GSK3 inactivation affects an
apoptotic signaling pathway.
Accordingly, lithium enhanced oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in PC3 (Fig. 5A) and DU145 cells (Fig. 5B) treated with
500 nmol/L CDDO-Me. BOC-D-fmk blocked DNA fragmentation
induced by both doses of CDDO-Me independently on modulation
by lithium.

CDDO-Me–Induced Cell Death Targets GSK3

On the other hand, lithium reduced substantial oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in PC3 cells treated with 1 Amol/L CDDOMe (Fig. 5A). This apparently paradoxical effect could be due to
degradation of oligonucleosomes (35) or to a decrease or absence
of apoptotic parameters, including chromatin condensation and
DNA fragmentation, in a more advanced phase of cell death and in

severely damaged cells undergoing necrosis-like forms of death
depending on the concentrations of the drug and duration of
exposure (36, 37). Extracellular LDH release, indicative of loss of
viability due to cell membrane damage, was then examined.
Enhancement of CDDO-Me cytotoxicity by lithium was clearly
confirmed by increased LDH release in PC3 cells treated with

Figure 5. The GSK3h inhibitor lithium chloride sensitizes prostate cancer cells to CDDO-Me cytotoxicity. Cell viability, as evaluated by the MTT or LDH assay at
48 h, were assessed in PC3 (A ) and DU145 cells (B) treated with CDDO-Me at the indicated concentrations and lithium chloride (LiCl ; 50 mmol/L). BOC-D-fmk
(BOC ; 10 Amol/L) was administered 2 h before CDDO-Me addition. DNA fragmentation in PC3 (A) and DU145 (B) cells treated with lithium and CDDO-Me

1 Amol/L CDDO-Me for 48 hours (Fig. 5A), as well as in DU145 cells
(Fig. 5B). The ability by BOC-D-fmk to reverse this effect suggests
that enhanced cytotoxicity as cell membrane damage induced by
lithium in combination with CDDO-Me correlates with accelerated
caspase activation (Fig. 5C) and fostered caspase-dependent
secondary necrosis. However, BOC-D-fmk did not completely
block LDH release induced by 1 Amol/L CDDO-Me independently
of the presence of lithium, indicating the concurrent induction of
caspase-independent primary necrosis by CDDO-Me at this dose
(Fig. 5A and B). Limited LDH release (average, 20 F 5.0%) at the
same time point in PC3 and DU145 cells treated with 500 nmol/L
CDDO-Me was not significantly affected by lithium and was
lowered nearly to control levels by BOC-D-fmk, suggesting the
occurrence of secondary necrosis (data not shown).
We then tested if GSK3 knockdown recapitulates the effects of
GSK3 pharmacologic inhibitors on the apoptotic parameters
modulated by CDDO-Me and on sensitization to CDDO-Me
cytotoxicity. GSK3a/h levels in PC3 and DU145 cells were reduced
by targeted siRNA transfection for 48 hours, followed by treatment
with CDDO-Me at 1 Amol/L for 24 hours. As shown in Fig. 6, a
remarkable reduction of GSK3h expression was obtained in both
cell lines by RNA interferences at 48 and 72 hours of transfection.
Decreased GSK3 levels resulted in PARP cleavage (Fig. 6A),
paralleled by loss of MTT reduction (Fig. 6B and C), in untreated
cells, and in increased PARP cleavage (Fig. 6A), remarkable loss of
MTT reduction (Fig. 6B and C), and augmented LDH release

(Supplementary Fig. S1D) in the cells treated with CDDO-Me at
1 Amol/L. Similar to the effects observed in the MTT assay with
GSK3 inhibition by lithium (Fig. 5A and B), BOC-D-fmk was unable
to significantly rescue the loss of viability in control GSK3a/
h-silenced cells and in samples treated with CDDO-Me for 24 hours
(Fig. 6C). LDH levels induced by CDDO-Me at 24 hours were
partially reduced by BOC-D-fmk; however, LDH release in the
presence of BOC-D-fmk was significantly more elevated in GSK3a/
h-silenced cells than in cells transfected with negative control
siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1D). These data suggest that cellular
distress induced by GSK3 depletion acts, at least in part, in a
caspase-independent fashion. Taken together, these results underlie
the importance of GSK3 in prostate cancer cell survival and
confirm that GSK3 inactivation or, more effectively, GSK3 depletion
sensitizes PC3 and DU145 cells to CDDO-Me–induced cell death.

Discussion
In this work, we investigated the effects of synthetic CDDO
triterpenoids, in particular CDDO-Me, on prostate cancer cell
viability and AKT signaling and identified GSK3h as a target of its
activity.
CDDO-Me induced apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway,
as indicated by cytochrome c release and caspase-9 and caspase-3
activation, and through a nuclear pathway, as determined by
oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and PARP cleavage; however,

CDDO-Me–Induced Cell Death Targets GSK3

it concurrently activated a partially caspase-independent branch,
contributing to necrosis-like death (36). In fact, although general or
specific caspase inhibition repressed nuclear apoptosis induced by
CDDO-Me, caspase inhibition as well as caspase-3 depletion by
siRNA was not sufficient to prevent CDDO-Me–induced cell death,
as assessed by loss of MTT reduction (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, timeand dose-dependent cell membrane disruption, a manifestation of
CDDO-Me cytotoxicity, was only partially caspase dependent (Fig.
5A and B; Supplementary Fig. S1D), suggesting the concurrent
induction of secondary and primary necrosis. Although necrotic
cell death is not always caspase independent, energetic failure, as
indicated by ATP depletion in CDDO-Me–treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A), can redirect apoptotic cell death progression to
a caspase-independent route (36, 38, 39). These data are in line
with previous reports showing that CDDO triterpenoids can
activate caspases and caspase-independent cell death in the same
cell (40, 41) and suggest the activation of more than one death
program depending on the intensity and duration of exposure to
the noxious stimulus (36, 42).
In dying cells treated with CDDO-Me, GSK3h phosphorylation
was preserved and uncoupled from AKT phosphorylation. The role
of GSK3 in prostate cancer biology is still controversial because both
its activation (43) and inhibition (26) have been indicated as potential targets of therapy. GSK3 can exert both a proapoptotic and an
antiapoptotic role, mostly depending on the stimulus- and cell type–
specific activation of the intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic pathways
(25). The data presented herein suggest that GSK3h-inactivating
phosphorylation is instrumental in CDDO-Me–stimulated prostate
cancer cell death. These findings are in agreement with previous
reports showing sensitization of cancer cells to death by pharmacologic inhibitors or genetic depletion of GSK3 (30, 44).
GSK3 inhibitors can sensitize androgen-independent prostate
cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) through caspase-8 activation (30). Intriguingly,
CDDO triterpenoids have been shown to reverse the TRAILresistant phenotype by promoting caspase-8 activation in different
tumor cell types (16, 45). We observed that CDDO-Me activates
caspase-8 also in prostate cancer cells. It will thus be interesting to
define whether sensitization to a caspase-8–mediated cell death
pathway by synthetic triterpenoids could depend on GSK3hinactivating phosphorylation shown in this work.
GSK3 inactivation led to enhanced apoptotic features induced by
CDDO-Me, including caspase activation and caspase-dependent
nuclear apoptosis. Notably, increased DNA fragmentation in PC3
and DU145 cells treated with a lower dose of CDDO-Me (500 nmol/L)
and lithium reproducibly reached the levels induced by 1 Amol/L
CDDO-Me alone (Fig. 5A and B), suggesting that forced GSK3h
inactivation lowers the apoptotic threshold in prostate cancer cells.
This hypothesis is supported by the fact that BOC-D-fmk was able
to partly inhibit increased LDH release induced by CDDO-Me in

GSK3-depleted cells (Fig. 5A and B; Supplementary Fig. S1D), thus
indicating the occurrence of caspase-dependent secondary necrosis
consistent with increased apoptotic load due to massive caspase
activation and enhanced PARP cleavage (Figs. 5C and 6A).
Several observations, however, suggest that GSK3 inactivation,
besides reinforcing apoptotic signaling, plays a role independent of
caspases in CDDO-Me cytotoxicity, maybe acting upstream of
caspase activation. In particular, general caspase inhibition did not
affect decreased cell viability in the MTT assay (Fig. 6C) and only
partially prevented enhanced LDH release induced by CDDO-Me at
24 hours in GSK3-depleted cells (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Taken together, these data suggest that GSK3 helps bring to
its limit the apoptotic potential in prostate cancer cells, thus
modulating the threshold of sensitivity to CDDO-Me and
possibly contributing to the molecular mechanism that regulates
a dose- and time-dependent apoptosis-necrosis switch (36, 39,
42, 46–48).
The AKT-activated survival pathway in prostate cancer cells is a
critical determinant of progression to androgen independence (43).
We previously reported a down-regulation of activated AKT by
antiangiogenic chemopreventive compounds (28, 49), which seems
a general property of chemically different chemopreventive agents
(50). The data presented in this work indicate that GSK3 can be
considered another target of proapoptotic chemopreventive agents,
in addition to AKT.
In conclusion, the finding that CDDO-Me at nanomolar or low
micromolar concentrations (500 nmol/L–1 Amol/L) can induce
tumor cell death by a GSK3-mediated pathway indicates that
CDDO-Me could overcome cell death resistance in tumors
unresponsive to conventional chemotherapy. The ongoing phase
I clinical trials in solid tumors and leukemia to set the maximum
tolerated dose of CDDO in patients will help evaluate the clinical
relevance of triterpenoids at this dose range, which is achievable
in vivo in animal models (6). The property of CDDO-Me to
modulate GSK3 activity could be an important mechanism to
regulate the apoptotic threshold of prostate cancer cells and could
have potential value for future application in combination
therapeutic regimens.
