ABSTRACT
Pancreatic tumor microenvironment (TME) is characterized by poor
tumor-vasculature and extensive desmoplasia that together contribute to poor
response to chemotherapy. It was recently shown that targeting of TME to inhibit
desmoplasiatic reaction in a preclinical model resulted in increased microvesseldensity and intratumoral drug concentration, leading to improved therapeutic
response. This approach; however, failed to generate a favorable response in clinical
trial. In that regard, we have previously demonstrated a role of gemcitabine-induced
CXCR4 signaling as a counter-defense mechanism, which also promoted invasiveness
of pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. Here, we investigated the effect of gemcitabine
on endothelial cell phenotype. Gemcitabine-treatment of human-umbilical-veinendothelial-cells (HUVECs) did not promote the growth of HUVECs; however, it was
induced when treated with conditioned media from gemcitabine-treated (Gem-CM)
PC cells due to increased cell-cycle progression and apoptotic-resistance. Moreover,
treatment of HUVECs with Gem-CM resulted in capillary-like structure (CLS) formation
and promoted their ability to migrate and invade through extracellular-matrix.
Gemcitabine-treatment of PC cells induced expression of various growth factors/
cytokines, including IL-8, which exhibited greatest upregulation. Further, IL-8
depletion in Gem-CM diminished its potency to promote angiogenic phenotypes.
Together, these findings suggest an indirect effect of gemcitabine on angiogenesis,
which, in light of our previous observations, may hold important clinical significance.

chemotherapy as the only viable option for treatment [3].
Disappointingly, none of the chemotherapeutic regimen
(single agent or combination) has been very successful,
and all provide only marginal survival benefit at the
best to the PC patients [4, 5]. Moreover, there also
remains a concern for unintended and undesired effects
of chemotherapy supported by recent findings [3, 6].
Therefore, it is extremely important that we develop an
improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying
chemoresistance of PC as well as the host response to
chemotherapy that may adversely affect overall clinical
outcome.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is largely an incurable
malignancy and one of the deadliest cancers in the
United States. According to American Cancer Society,
approximately 48,960 Americans will be diagnosed with
PC in 2015 and it will claim nearly 40,560 lives [1].
The median survival after diagnosis is ~2–8 months,
and only ~6% of all patients with PC survive 5 years
post-diagnosis [2]. At the time of diagnosis, most
pancreatic tumors are either highly genetically advanced
or have spread to distant sites leaving systemic

Angiogenesis is a process of new blood vessel
formation from the existing ones and plays important role
in tumor progression and metastasis [7, 8]. Remarkably,
pancreatic tumors are poorly vascularized relative to
other solid tumor types, and this unusual phenotype is
considered one of the main reasons underlying their
aggressive behavior and therapy-resistance [9, 10]. In a
preclinical study targeted at improving the therapeutic
outcome of gemcitabine in PC, depletion of tumorassociated stroma through hedgehog inhibition promoted
drug accumulation and associated with an increase
in tumor vascularization [11]. Although increased
vasculature was suggested to promote drug delivery at
the tumor site, mechanism(s) underlying this process
remained unanswered. Furthermore, true significance of
this induced phenotype is also debatable as the similar
therapeutic approach failed in a clinical trial [12]. It is
likely that the increased tumor vasculature may work
both ways i.e. increase drug delivery to the tumor site or
facilitate escape of the tumor cells to other niches favoring
tumor cell survival and thus chemoresistance. Latter seems
further plausible considering our recent observation,
where treatment of PC cells with gemcitabine promoted
their invasiveness through upregulation of CXCR4 [3].
Chemotherapy-induced angiogenesis has been reported
in other cancer as well [13]. Moreover, it has also been
shown that drug treatment leads to an acute recruitment
of circulating endothelial progenitor cells to tumors in
mice [14].
The present study was undertaken to examine the
effect of gemcitabine on endothelial cell phenotype and
identify potential mediator(s) in this process. Our data
demonstrate that gemcitabine does not have a direct
favorable impact on endothelial cells, but rather affects
them via inducing angiogenic signals in treated PC
cells. We show gemcitabine induces the expression of
several angiogenesis-promoting cytokines with highest
upregulation in the levels of IL-8. Depletion of IL-8
from conditioned media of gemcitabine-treated PC cells
diminished its promotion of endothelial cell proliferation,
survival, motility and invasiveness, and capillary
formation. Together, these findings shed new light on
another unintended effect of chemotherapy, whose clinical
significance remains yet to be established.

treatment on the growth of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs). The data show no change
or a decreased (at high doses) growth of HUVECs upon
treatment with gemcitabine (Supplementary Figure 1).
Therefore, we next examined the indirect effect of
gemcitabine on endothelial cell growth by treating them
with the conditioned media from vehicle (V-CM) or
gemcitabine (Gem-CM) treated PC (Colo-357 and
MiaPaCa) cells for 24 and 48 h. Our data reveal a
significant increase in the growth of HUVECs when
treated with Gem-CM obtained from Colo-357 and
MiaPaCa cells. The growth of HUVECs is increased
by ~30 % and ~22 % upon 24 h treatment of Gem-CM
from Colo-357 and MiaPaCa cells, respectively, as
compared with the HUVECs treated with respective
V-CM (Figure 1A). This difference grew further at
48 h with ~77 % and ~51 % increase in the growth of
HUVECs, when treated with Gem-CM from Colo-357 and
MiaPaCa cells, respectively.
We next examined the effect of Gem-CM on cell
cycle progression and survival of endothelial cells. Our
cell-cycle data demonstrate an enhanced cell-cycle
progression in HUVECs treated with Gem-CM. A greater
fraction (~26.9 % and ~26 %) of HUVECs is detected
in S-phase upon treatment with Colo-357-Gem-CM and
MiaPaCa-Gem-CM, respectively as compared to those
treated with Colo-357-V-CM (~6.3 %) and MiaPaCaV-CM (~8.6 %) (Figure 1B). In addition, the data
from apoptosis assay indicate lower apoptotic index in
HUVECs treated with Colo-357-Gem-CM (~15.5 %) and
MiaPaCa-Gem-CM (~13.8 %) in comparison to those
treated with V-CM (~27 %) from Colo-357 and MiaPaCa
(~25.3 %) (Figure 1C). Together, these findings indicate
that Gem-CM enhances growth of endothelial cells by
promoting cell-cycle progression and apoptosis resistance.

Conditioned media from gemcitabine-treated
pancreatic cancer cells promotes in vitro
angiogenesis and migration and invasion of
endothelial cells
Having observed growth induction of endothelial
cells upon treatment with conditioned media from
gemcitabine-treated (Gem-CM) PC cells, we next
examined if Gem-CM would also promote the
in vitro angiogenesis. For this, HUVECs were seeded in
Matrigel-coated 96-well plate in the presence of V-CM or
Gem-CM for 16 h and effect on the capillary-like structure
(CLS) formation was examined. Our data demonstrate
that treatment of HUVECs with Gem-CM resulted in
robust CLS formation (Figure 2). HUVECs treated with
Colo-357-Gem-CM and MiaPaCa-Gem-CM exhibit
enhanced number of CLS (~38 and ~29, respectively) as
compared to those treated with Colo-357-V-CM (~8) and
MiaPaCa-V-CM (~6) (Figure 2).

RESULTS
Conditioned media from gemcitabine-treated
pancreatic cancer cells enhances growth
of endothelial cells by promoting cell-cycle
progression and survival
Since enhanced gemcitabine accumulation at
the tumor site coincided with enhanced blood vessel
formation [11], we first examined the effect of gemcitabine

Colo-357 and MiaPaCa, respectively, as compared to that
from V-CM (Figure 3B). Importantly, when we pre-treated
HUVECs for 12 h with V-CM or Gem-CM, a greater
effect of Gem-CM on motility and invasion of HUVECs
was recorded (Supplementary Figure 2). Collectively, our
findings suggest that Gem-CM has the potential to trigger
angiogenic phenotype in endothelial cells.

highest induction in the expression of IL-8 (~123 fold),
which is secreted by pancreatic tumor cells and known to
trigger angiogenesis through the recruitment of immune
cells at tumor site [15, 17]. To validate the IL-8 induction in
gemcitabine treated PC cells, Colo-357 and MiaPaCa cells
were treated with vehicle or gemcitabine and effect on IL-8
at protein level was examined by immunoblot analysis. We
observed enhanced expression of IL-8 in both the PC cells
upon gemcitabine treatment as compared to vehicle treated
PC cells (Figure 4B). Moreover, the amount of secreted
IL-8 by the Colo-357 and MiaPaCa cells following
gemcitabine treatment was also determined by ELISA.
Data show that level of IL-8 is increased in the culture
supernatant of gemcitabine-treated Colo-357 (~4.7 fold)
as well as MiaPaCa (~4.1 fold) cells as compared to their
respective vehicle-treated controls (Figure 4C). Taken
together, our data suggest that treatment of gemcitabine
induces the expression of various cytokines including IL-8
in PC cells.

Gemcitabine induces expression of
angiogenesis-associated cytokines in
pancreatic cancer cells
Cytokines or growth factors secreted by tumor
cells play important roles in the endothelial cell
proliferation and new blood vessels formation at tumor
site [8, 16, 17]. To understand the molecular mechanism
of the Gem-CM-induced angiogenesis, we treated PC
(Colo-357) cells with vehicle or gemcitabine for 8 h, and
effect on the various angiogenesis-associated cytokines
and/or growth factors was examined by quantitative
RT-PCR. Our data demonstrate that among the 25 genes
analyzed (Supplementary Table 1), we observed
15  cytokines/growth factors to be up-regulated (≥ two
fold difference; p value ≤ 0.05) in gemcitabine-treated
Colo-357 cells (Figure 4A). Interestingly, we observed the

medium and incubated for next 24 h. Thereafter, total protein was isolated and subjected to immunoblot analysis to examine IL-8 expression
using specific antibody. β-actin was used as a loading control. C. Level of IL-8 in conditioned media of vehicle or gemcitabine treated
PC cells was measured using ELISA as described in materials and methods. Data is presented as mean ± SD; n = 3 .*p < 0.05.

DISCUSSION

Colo-357 cells was pre-incubated with human IL-8
neutralizing antibody or control IgG for 24 h and effect
on the phenotypes of HUVEC monitored. As expected,
we observed significant growth induction (~70 %) of
HUVECs by the Gem-CM pre-treated with control IgG
(Figure 5A). Notably, very marginal growth-induction
(~13.2 %) is observed when HUVECs were incubated
with Gem-CM-pretreated with human IL-8 neutralizing
antibody (Figure 5A). To validate a role of IL-8 in the
Gem-CM-induced CLS formation, HUVECs plated
on matrigel were treated with Gem-CM pretreated
with control IgG or IL-8 neutralizing antibody. Data
demonstrate that pretreatment of IL-8 neutralizing
antibody significantly abrogates the Gem-CM-induced
CLS formation in HUVEC cells as compared to GemCM pretreated with control IgG (Figure 5B). Similarly,
our data from migration and invasion assay demonstrate
that Gem-CM-induced effect on HUVEC migration
(Figure 6A) and invasion (Figure 6B) was significantly
inhibited upon neutralization of IL-8 in that. Together,
these findings confirm that gemcitabine triggers the
expression of IL-8 in PC cells that induces endothelial
cells proliferation, CLS formation and increases motility
and invasiveness.

Angiogenesis is a fundamental phenomenon
associated with the development, progression and therapyresistance in almost every type of cancer including
PC [8, 18]. It promotes the growth of tumor cells by
nourishing them with oxygen and nutrients. In addition,
it also enhances the metastasis by helping the spread
of cancer cells throughout the body at their favorable
niches [7, 19]. Successful angiogenesis is a multi-step
process, which includes growth, invasion and migration,
and differentiation of endothelial cells. The process
usually begins when transformed cells begin secreting
stromal modifying proteins, including angiogenic
factors, and later may involve synergistic cooperation
between tumor and stromal cells [7, 20–22]. The data
presented herein indicate that this process is facilitated
by the treatment of PC cells with gemcitabine through
altered expression of angiogenic proteins. This effect is
in contrast to an earlier report, which demonstrated that
direct treatment of endothelial cells with anti-cancer drugs
(doxorubicin, cisplatin and vincristine) induced angiogenic
phenotypes [13]. In fact, we did not observe any growth
promoting effect of gemcitabine on endothelial cells, but

slightly decreased growth at high doses further suggesting
that the effect of chemotherapy on angiogenesis promotion
is rather indirect. Controlled cell cycle progression is
critical for the development of new vasculature and
elongation of the new capillary vessel [23]. Similarly,
increased resistance to apoptosis in endothelial cells is also
crucial during angiogenesis [24]. Directed migration and
invasion, and formation of new capillary like structures
are other important phenotypic behavior essential for
angiogenesis [15, 25]. In corroboration with these notions,
our data showed that Gem-CM not only promoted cellcycle progression and survival of endothelial cells, but
also enhanced their motility and invasive potential and
capillary vessel formation.
Tumor-associated angiogenesis is tightly regulated
by a fine balance of pro and anti-angiogenic factors
including growth factors and/or cytokines present at
tumor site [16, 26]. Pro-angiogenic effects of CM of
gemcitabine-treated PC cells suggested that gemcitabine
treatment programmed them for the secretion of
angiogenesis-promoting factors. This notion was later
supported by our data demonstrating gemcitabine-induced
upregulation of the expression of various pro-angiogenic
cytokines/growth factors, including IL-8. Moreover, pretreatment of Gem-CM with IL-8 neutralizing antibody
partially abolished the Gem-CM-induced phenotypes
in endothelial cells confirming a participatory role of
IL-8 in Gem-CM-promoted angiogenic effects. IL-8
is a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by variety of
cancer cells including PC cells [27–29] and has been
shown to positively affect tumor as well as endothelial
cells through autocrine and paracrine signaling
[15, 24, 29, 30]. Exogenous addition of recombinant
IL-8 resulted in endothelial cell survival, proliferation
and induced capillary formation, an effect which was
abolished by inhibiting IL-8 [24]. IL-8 confers its effects
on cellular phenotypes upon binding to its two cell
surface cognate receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, which
are widely expressed on the cancer as well as endothelial
cells [31]. Consequently, silencing of these receptors has
also been shown to inhibit tumor and/or endothelial cell
proliferation, migration and capillary formation ability
[31, 32]. Besides IL-8, we also observed significant
induction of some other pro-angiogenic cytokines/
growth factors, such as TNF-alpha upon gemcitabine
treatment. However, previous studies suggest that TNFalpha-induced neovascularization is mostly indirect. In the
rabbit cornea, TNF-alpha induced angiogenesis in an IL-8
-dependent manner suggesting the molecular interaction
between these two pathways [17]. Similarly, TNF-alpha
promoted neovascularization in dental pulp cells through
VEGF and SIRT1 [33]. Therefore, it appears that IL-8
plays a major role in gemcitabine-induced angiogenesis;
however, its cooperative action with other angiogenic
factors needs to be further examined.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Like many other tumor-promoting genes, expression
of IL-8 in cancer cells can be regulated by a variety of
mechanisms [34–36]. Our data show that gemcitabine
induces IL-8 expression at transcriptional level in PC
cells. Previous studies suggest IL-8 to be a potential target
of NF-κB and HIF-1α [37, 38], which are associated
with PC progression [2, 39]. Recently, we have shown
that gemcitabine promotes the transcriptional activity of
NF-κB and HIF-1α in PC cells by enhancing their nuclear
level. Moreover, we also showed that effect of gemcitabine
on NF-κB and HIF-1α is mediated through reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation in PC cells. These
studies suggest a plausible mechanism for gemcitabineinduced IL-8 upregulation in PC cells via activation of
NF-κB and/or HIF-1α. TNF-alpha is also reported to
regulate IL-8 production through NF-κB [40]. Since we
also identified TNF-alpha to be significantly upregulated
in response to gemcitabine, it is possible that gemcitabinemediated IL-8 upregulation is through both direct and
indirect activation of NF-κB, and/or involves additional
cross-talking mechanisms.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the
gemcitabine treatment in PC cells results in the induction
of IL-8, which in turn act on endothelial cells to promote
their growth, migration and angiogenesis. These novel
findings thus suggest that gemcitabine could induce the
vasculature to the tumor site, which may either support
resistance to chemotherapy by providing a more favorable
growth environment or facilitate escape of tumor cells to
other safe and chemoresistant niches.

HUVECs were cultured in serum-free media for 48 h
to synchronize them. Following synchronization, cells were
treated with V-CM or Gem-CM for 24 h and processed for
cell-cycle analysis as previously described by us [41, 42].

RNA isolation and reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent and
complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using 2 μg
of total RNA and High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA™ Kit.
Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was performed in
96-well plates using cDNA and SYBR Green Master Mix
on an iCycler system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) by specific
sets of primer pairs (Supplementary Table 1). GAPDH was
used as internal control. The thermal conditions for realtime PCR assays were as follows: cycle 1: 95 °C for 10 min,
cycle 2 (x 40): 95 °C for 10 sec and 58 °C for 45 sec.

Gemcitabine treatment and collection of
conditioned media
Colo-357 and MiaPaCa cells (1x106/well) were
seeded in 6-well plates and grown to subconfluence.
Subsequently, cells were treated with either vehicle (PBS)
or gemcitabine (10 μM) for 8 h. Media was replaced posttreatment with fresh low serum (2.5 %) containing media
and cells were allowed to grow for next 48 h. Thereafter,
conditioned media (CM) was collected, centrifuged
for 10  min at 2500 rpm at 4 °C, filtered with 0.22 μm
membrane filter (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) to remove
cell debris and designated as V-CM (from vehicle-treated
cells) and Gem-CM (from gemcitabine-treated cells).

Western blot analysis
Protein extraction and immunoblotting was carried out
as previously described [39, 43, 44] using anti-IL-8 antibody
(1:1000) and HRP-labeled secondary antibodies (1:2000).
β-actin served as a loading control. Immunodetection was
performed following incubation of the immunoblots with
SuperSignal West Femto Maximum sensitivity substrate.
Protein bands were visualized using a LAS-3000 image
analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan).

In vitro cell growth assay
To examine the direct effect of gemcitabine on
HUVECs growth, cells (1x104 cells/well) were seeded in
96-well plate, incubated for 24 h, subsequently treated with
various doses of gemcitabine (0–20 μM) for 48 h and growth
was measured by WST-1 assay as described earlier [2, 41].
To examine the effect of V-CM or Gem-CM on HUVECs
growth, cells (1x104 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plate
and cultured for 24 h. Thereafter, media was replaced with
V-CM or Gem-CM collected from Colo-357 and MiaPaCa
cells and HUVECs were allowed to grow for next 24 or 48 h
and cell growth was monitored as described above. To study
the role of IL-8, Gem-CM was incubated with control IgG
(200 ng/mL) or IL-8 neutralizing antibody (200 ng/mL) for
24 h and centrifuged prior to HUVECs treatment.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Level of IL-8 in conditioned media obtained from
vehicle- or gemcitabine -treated PC cells was measured
by using human IL-8 ELISA kit as per manufacturer’s
instructions.

In vitro capillary tube formation assay
Matrigel-coated 96 well plate was prepared according
to manufacturer’s instruction, and HUVECs (1 × 104) were
seeded in V-CM or Gem-CM or Gem-CM pre-incubated
with control IgG /IL-8 neutralizing antibody (200 ng/mL)
for 24 h. After 16 h of incubation, capillary like structure
(CLS) formation was observed under the microscope and
counted in ten random fields of view (100 X).

Measurement of apoptosis
HUVECs were seeded (1x106 cells/well) in 6-well
plates and grown for 24 h. Subsequently, media was replaced
with either V-CM or Gem-CM collected from Colo-357
and MiaPaCa cells. After 48 h incubation, HUVECs were
harvested, stained with 7-Amino-Actinomycin (7-AAD)
and PE Annexin V using commercially available kit and
analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described [39].

Endothelial cells were plated on the top chamber
of non-coated polyethylene teraphthalate membrane
(2.5 × 105 cells/inserts, for migration assay) or Matrigelcoated polycarbonate membrane (1x105 cells/inserts, for

chamber as a chemo-attractant. After 16 h of incubation,
cells on the upper surface of the insert membrane were
removed with the help of cotton swab. Migrated or
invaded cells to the bottom of the insert were fixed and
stained with Diff-Quick cell staining kit and mounted on
slide, random images were taken and plotted as average
number of cells per field (200 X). To investigate the role
of IL-8 in endothelial cells migration and invasion, we
depleted IL-8 from Gem-CM by incubating it with control
IgG or IL-8 neutralizing antibody (200 ng/mL) for 24 h
and used it for migration and invasion assays. In parallel,
HUVECs were pre-treated with conditioned media (V-CM
or Gem-CM) for 12 h and effect on migration and invasion
was examined as described above.
