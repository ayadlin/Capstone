ABSTRACT
Resistance to treatment with anticancer drugs is a signiﬁcant obstacle and a
fundamental cause of therapeutic failure in cancer therapy. Functional doxorubicin
(DOX) nanoparticles for targeted delivery of the classical cytotoxic anticancer drug
DOX to tumor cells, using folate-terminated polyrotaxanes along with dequalinium,
have been developed and proven to overcome this resistance due to specific molecular
features, including a size of approximately 101 nm, a zeta potential of 3.25 mV and
drug-loading content of 18%. Compared with free DOX, DOX hydrochloride, DOX
nanoparticles, and targeted DOX nanoparticles, the functional DOX nanoparticles
exhibited the strongest anticancer efﬁcacy in vitro and in the drug-resistant MCF-7/
Adr (DOX) xenograft tumor model. More specifically, the nanoparticles signiﬁcantly
increased the intracellular uptake of DOX, selectively accumulating in mitochondria
and the endoplasmic reticulum after treatment, with release of cytochrome C as
a result. Furthermore, the caspase-9 and caspase-3 cascade was activated by the
functional DOX nanoparticles through upregulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins
Bax and Bid and suppression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, thereby enhancing
apoptosis by acting on the mitochondrial signaling pathways. In conclusion, functional
DOX nanoparticles may provide a strategy for increasing the solubility of DOX and
overcoming multidrug-resistant cancers.

INTRODUCTION

resistance (MDR) in tumor cells. MDR involves acquired
and intrinsic resistance. Acquired resistance in cancer may
derive from a drug stimulus, leading to the overexpression
of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and the
subsequent efﬂux of anticancer drugs from within
cancer cells [2]. Intrinsic resistance is mainly associated
with mitochondria, which are considered the major
powerhouses of cells, playing central roles in energy
metabolism and in apoptosis [3].
The induction of cancer cell apoptosis involves
several factors, including activation of genes encoding

The clinical failure of chemotherapy in cancer
could be associated with the conventional administration
of anticancer drugs as ‘free’ drugs. Such administration
leads to a limited drug concentration at tumor sites due
to non-targeted distribution throughout the body tissues
[1]. Targeted drug delivery offers a potential alternative
strategy for chemotherapy.
Another major problem in the clinical treatment
of cancer with chemotherapeutic drugs is multidrug

pro-apoptotic proteins and inhibition of genes encoding
antiapoptotic proteins, which initiates the apoptosis of
cancer cells and the opening of mitochondrial permeability
transition pores. These events result in the release of
cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytoplasm and
activation of the apoptotic protein enzyme caspase-9,
which leads to downstream activation of caspase-3 [4,
5]. A number of mechanisms, such as Bax/Bak or Bcl
channels, could cause the release of apoptogenic factors
[6, 7].
Accordingly, mitochondria have been considered
as a potential drug delivery target in the treatment of
malignant cancers, leading to the design of mitochondriatargeting, anticancer drug-loaded nanoparticles.
Mitochondria in cancers are negatively charged, whereas
mitochondria-targeting,
drug-loaded
nanoparticles
carry a number of positive charges, thereby enhancing
any possible binding between the mitochondria and the
nanocarriers internalized by cancer cells [8, 9].
Dequalinium (DQA) is an amphipathic, cationic
compound that contains two cationic aminoquinaldinium
rings separated by a 10-carbon methylene bridge and that
can selectively accumulate in mitochondria, driven by
the transmembrane electric potential [10, 11]. Therefore,
DQA has been used for the selective delivery of drugs into
mitochondria [11].
Polyrotaxanes are necklace-like inclusion
complexes formed by the host-guest interaction between
cyclodextrins and polymeric chains via threading of the
polymeric chains into the cavity of the cyclodextrins
[12, 13]. Nanoparticles composed of these regular stacks
of cyclodextrins along polymeric chains can be selfassembled by polyrotaxanes. α-Cyclodextrin (α-CD)
is a cyclic oligosaccharide composed of six D-glucose
units linked by 1,4-α-glucosidic bonds that is widely
used in pharmaceutical science due to its excellent
biocompatibility. Meanwhile, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
not only is regarded as a biodegradable material but is
also known to achieve prolonged circulation in the blood.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The fabrication of nanoparticles via the crystallization of
polyrotaxanes has been reported [14-16], and it is evident
that α-CD/PEG polyrotaxane nanoparticles are attractive
drug carriers.
In a previous study, we successfully synthesized
folate-terminated polyrotaxanes (FPRs) that can
condense DNA efficiently and that exhibit excellent gene
transfection activity compared with Boc-Tyr-terminated
polyrotaxanes (BPRs) [17]. Based on the interaction
of folate with the folate receptor on MCF cells, a drug
encapsulated in the delivery system can effectively bypass
P-gp, target a specific site and induce apoptosis [18-20].
However, whether FPRs, as a carrier, can be applied as
a delivery drug system that targets drug-resistant cancer
cells is unknown.
Doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline antibiotic, is
a commonly used cytotoxic drug that exhibits a distinct
anticancer effect on various human cancers in the clinic.
However, the anticancer activity of DOX is signiﬁcantly
limited due to its poor aqueous solubility [21] and due to
drug resistance [22]. In the current study, we designed a
type of functional DOX nanoparticle that was prepared
using FPRs and DQA as nanocarrier-forming materials.
The objective of this study was to characterize the
functional DOX nanoparticles and their targeting effect,
mechanism of action, and anticancer efficacy in resistant
tumors (Fig. 1).

RESULTS
Characterization of nanoparticles
The self-assembly method appears to be particularly
suitable for the incorporation of DOX and DQA into BPRor FPR-based nanoparticles; in the present study, DOX
nanoparticles, targeted DOX nanoparticles, and functional
DOX nanoparticles were formed. Table 1 lists the average

the various types of nanoparticles (blank nanoparticles,
DOX nanoparticles, targeted DOX nanoparticles, and
functional DOX nanoparticles). The corresponding
average particle sizes were 90±1.80 nm, 120±2.40 nm,
104±2.50 nm, and 99±2.52 nm, respectively. Accordingly,
the zeta potential values were -1.65±0.54, -3.56±1.45,
-1.68±0.77, and 3.25±1.55, respectively, and the DLC
values were 0%, 17.0±0.6%, 17.6±0.6%, and 18.0±0.7%,

respectively. For all nanoparticles prepared, the EE of
DOX was >80%. For the functional DOX nanoparticles,
the PDI values for all micelles were approximately 0.2.

types after staining with 1% uranyl acetate. Spherical
particles of uniform size were observed by TEM, with
sizes in the range of 100-120 nm. Fig. 2B demonstrates

that the solubility of DOX increased with an increase in
the nanoparticle-forming material’s total concentration.
When the nanoparticle-forming material’s concentration
reached 25 µM, the solubility values of DOX in the DOX
nanoparticles, targeted DOX nanoparticles, and functional
DOX nanoparticles were 974±32 µg/ml, 1334±53 µg/ml,
1445±23 µg/ml, respectively.
Fig. 2C shows the rates of in vitro DOX release
from the drug-loaded nanoparticles in PBS containing
10% FBS. The results show that the rates of DOX release
from all nanoparticles were less than 20% at 2 h. Over 12
h, the release rate of DOX·HCL injection was greater than
98% in body fluids, but the rate was less than 10% for
DOX powder suspensions. Meanwhile, the rates of release
from the DOX nanoparticles, targeted DOX nanoparticles,
and functional DOX nanoparticles at 12 h were as follows:
36.0±0.9%, 45.0±1.0% and 50.3±2.4%, respectively.
In contrast to the release proﬁle of DOX injection, the
profiles of the various types of DOX nanoparticles
exhibited delayed release characteristics; after 12 h, the
release curves of all DOX-loaded nanoparticles exhibited
plateau-like proﬁles.

Cellular uptake and mitochondrial targeting

Cellular uptake
Fig. 4A presents ﬂow cytometry images of the
cellular uptake of the various DOX formulations. After
applying blank medium, free 6-coumarin, 6-coumarin
nanoparticles, targeted 6-coumarin nanoparticles, or
functional 6-coumarin nanoparticles, the geometric
mean ﬂuorescence intensities in MCF-7 cells were
5.93±1.12, 213.48±2.36, 450.34±12.22, 787.55±10.2
and 1322.27±32.12 (Fig. 4A, blue), respectively, and
those in MCF-7/Adr cells were 6.54±1.21, 111.23±3.46,
428.43±12.21, 820.34±23.13 and 1335.67±52.32 (Fig.
4A, red), respectively. The geometric mean ﬂuorescence
intensities indicated the uptake of 6-coumarin into the
cells.
MCF-7 and MCF-7/Adr cells were observed by
confocal microscopy at 2 h after applying free rhodamine
123, rhodamine 123 nanoparticles, targeted rhodamine 123
nanoparticles or functional rhodamine 123 nanoparticles,
as shown in Fig. 4B (left and right, respectively).
Distinct cellular accumulation resulted from the fact
that the highly hydrophilic free rhodamine 123 readily
diffused into the MCF-7 cells. Compared with those of
the rhodamine 123 nanoparticles and targeted rhodamine
123 nanoparticles, the overlaid images of the functional
rhodamine 123 nanoparticles displayed more intense green
ﬂuorescence for rhodamine 123 in the cell cytoplasm.
In contrast, the resistant MCF-7/Adr cells showed only
limited ﬂuorescence intensity for free rhodamine 123,
and the overlaid images of the functional rhodamine 123
nanoparticles displayed the strongest ﬂuorescence intensity
in the cell cytoplasm compared with the intensities

IC50 values of free DOX, DOX·HCL injection, DOX
nanoparticles, targeted DOX nanoparticles, and functional
DOX nanoparticles were 0.77 µM, 0.68 µM, 0.55 µM,
0.42 µM, and 0.24 µM, respectively. In contrast, the IC50
values of free DOX, DOX injection, DOX nanoparticles,
targeted DOX nanoparticles, and functional DOX
nanoparticles were 7.22 µM, 6.54 µM, 0.72 µM, 0.46 µM,
and 0.30 µM, respectively, when inhibiting MCF-7/Adr

the targeted rhodamine 123 nanoparticles. Interestingly,
the fluorescence of rhodamine 123 in functional DOX
nanoparticle-treated MCF-7/Adr cells was nearly the same
as that in functional DOX nanoparticle-treated MCF-7
cells, indicating a loss of DOX resistance in the MCF-7/
Adr cells.

6-coumarin nanoparticles, or functional 6-coumarin
nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 4. Yellow indicates
colocalization of the nanoparticles with organelleselective dyes, and red indicates non-colocalization.
The red fluorescence of the organelle-selective dyes was
observed in the presence of free 6-coumarin, indicating
that free 6-coumarin did not localize in lysosomes, the
ER, the GA or mitochondria (Fig. 4C, a1-a4, ar1-ar4).
Furthermore, the patterns of yellow ﬂuorescence indicated
that the 6-coumarin nanoparticles, targeted 6-coumarin
nanoparticles and functional 6-coumarin nanoparticles
did not accumulate in lysosomes (Fig. 4C, b1-d1, br1-dr1)

but speciﬁcally accumulated in the ER (Fig. 4C, b2-d2,
br2-dr2) and GA (Fig. 4C, b3-d3, br3-dr3). Additionally,
the functional 6-coumarin nanoparticles profoundly and

selectively accumulated in mitochondria (Fig. 4C, d4, dr4)
relative to accumulation in the ER and GA.

Drug content in the mitochondrial fraction
As shown in Fig. 5, the 6-coumarin content in
single mitochondria was observed after the addition of
blank culture medium, free 6-coumarin, 6-coumarin
nanoparticles, targeted 6-coumarin nanoparticles or
functional 6-coumarin nanoparticles to MCF-7 (Fig.
5A) or MCF-7/Adr (Fig. 5B) cells for 6 h. Compared
with the intensities observed after applying the free
6-coumarin, 6-coumarin nanoparticles, or targeted
6-coumarin nanoparticles, the ﬂuorescence intensity of
the mitochondria after applying the functional 6-coumarin
nanoparticles was 26.21-fold, 16.43-fold and 6.42fold higher, respectively. In contrast, the ﬂuorescence
intensity of the functional 6-coumarin nanoparticles
was approximately 9.54-fold higher than that of free
6-coumarin, 7.52-fold higher than that of the 6-coumarin
nanoparticles, and 6.83-fold higher than that of the
targeted 6-coumarin nanoparticles in the mitochondria of
the MCF-7/Adr cells.

higher than the expression of caspase-8, indicating that
caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated. Interestingly, the
caspase-9 activity ratios in MCF-7/(MCF-7/Adr) cells
were 15%/10%, 35%/32%, 43%/45%, and 84%/86%,
respectively. In contrast, the caspase-3 activity ratios in
MCF-7/(MCF-7/Adr) cells were 30%/15%, 45%/38%,
55%/50%, and 86%/87%, respectively, indicating that
drug resistance was overcome.

In vitro apoptosis-inducing effect

Bcl-2 family protein expression

Fig. 7 depicts apoptosis-inducing effects in MCF-7
(Fig. 7A) and MCF-7/Adr (Fig. 7B) cells after applying
blank culture medium, free DOX, DOX nanoparticles,
targeted DOX nanoparticles, or functional DOX
nanoparticles in vitro. The apoptosis-inducing effects
were evaluated by calculating the apoptotic percentage
during the early period. After applying the blank culture
medium, free DOX, DOX-loaded nanoparticles, targeted
DOX nanoparticles, or functional DOX nanoparticles,
the induced apoptotic percentages in MCF-7 cells were
7.17%, 9.14%, 14.52%, 17.52%, and 23.2%, respectively,
and those in MCF-7/Adr cells were 3.36%, 4.38%, 12.5%,
19.7%, and 24.5%, respectively.

Fig. 8B illustrates the activities of pro-apoptotic
proteins (Bax and Bid) and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2
and Bcl-xl) in MCF-7 and MCF-7/Adr cells, as determined
by western blotting. The Bax activity ratios for functional
DOX nanoparticles in the MCF-7/(MCF-7/Adr) cells
were 5.27/5.75-fold higher than for the blank control,
2.79/5.75-fold higher than for free DOX, 2.11/2.30-fold
higher than for DOX nanoparticles, and 1.22/1.22-fold
higher than for targeted DOX nanoparticles. Additionally,
the Bid activity ratios for functional DOX nanoparticles
in the MCF-7/(MCF-7/Adr) cells were 10.71/14.2fold higher than for the blank control, 6.25/12.66-fold
higher than for free DOX, 3.26/5.84-fold higher than for
DOX nanoparticles, and 1.74/2.17-fold higher than for
targeted DOX nanoparticles. However, the Bcl-2 activity
ratios for functional DOX nanoparticles, targeted DOX
nanoparticles, DOX nanoparticles, and free DOX in the
MCF-7/(MCF-7/Adr) cells were 5%/6%, 10%/32%,
35%/84%, 66%/93%, and 92%/94%, respectively,
suggesting that the functional DOX nanoparticles can
inhibit resistant MCF-7 cells.

Anticancer efﬁcacy in resistant human breast
cancer xenografts

after administration of functional DOX nanoparticles but
was observed in the mice given DOX·HCL.

DISCUSSION

Fig. 9 depicts anticancer efﬁcacy in the MCF-7
and MCF-7/Adr xenograft model (Fig. 9C). The results
show that DOX·HCL, he DOX nanoparticles, and the
targeted DOX nanoparticles had a minimal inhibitory
effect on the MCF-7 (Fig. 9A) and MCF-7/Adr (Fig. 9B)
xenografts when administered by intravenous injection
(30.2±14.3%/18.2±12.34%, 52.2±10.12%/58.8±15.5%,
and 75.6±15.25%/78.23±24.5%, respectively, at day 34).
In contrast, the functional DOX nanoparticles had the
best antitumor efﬁcacy when administered by intravenous
injection, as reflected by the lower tumor volume
(86.4±10.8%/88±21.12% at day 34).
Body weight changes in the tumor-bearing mice
were observed during the study of antitumor efﬁcacy in
MCF-7 (Fig. 9D) and MCF-7/Adr (Fig. 9E) xenografts.
Given the results observed for both administration types,
significant body weight loss was not observed in the mice

MDR is a main reason for poor prognosis in
chemotherapy. MDR in cancer may be caused by many
factors, including cancer cell membrane-related drug
resistance due to overexpression of ABC transporters and
mitochondria-related drug resistance, which are involved
in overall resistance to chemotherapy. However, the
speciﬁc delivery of an anticancer drug to a tumor site can
signiﬁcantly improve the efficacy of chemotherapy [28].
Thus, the synthesis of targeted nanoparticles is a promising
approach for the targeted delivery of anticancer drugs.
In the present study, functional DOX nanoparticles
were developed using FPRs and DQA as the nanoparticleforming materials. The constructed functional DOX
nanoparticles had the following physicochemical features:
a small particle size (approximately 100 nm), a slightly

positive potential, high EE (85%), high DLC (>18%), high
DOX solubility (>1 mg/ml) (Table 1), and delayed drug
release (Fig. 2A). As shown in Table 1, the size of the
drug-loaded nanoparticles was larger than that of blank
nanoparticles due to the incorporation of the drug into the
nanoparticles’ matrix, which increased the concentration
of the solid phase and reduced the zeta potential of the
prepared nanoparticles. However, the folate-modiﬁed
nanoparticles were relatively smaller than unmodified
nanoparticles; this disparity may have been caused by
the enhanced hydrophilicity of the nanoparticles’ surface
due to the incorporation of folate. The zeta potentials of
empty nanoparticles, DOX nanoparticles, and targeted
DOX nanoparticles were estimated to range between

-1 mV and -3.5 mV. Interestingly, the functional DOX
nanoparticles instead displayed positive zeta potential
values (3.5 mV). The reason for this different result
may have been the addition of DQA. However, the main
problem faced by nanodrug carriers is low DLC; in
most polymeric drug nanocarriers, such as nanospheres
and micelles, the DLC is less than 10% [19, 29]. Yang
et al. reported that a low dose of anticancer drugs is less
effective against drug-resistant cancers [30] . For all three
polyrotaxane nanoparticle formulations presented here,
however, the DLC and EE were greater than 17% and
85%, respectively. This explains why polyrotaxane is
superior to other carriers for drug delivery. Furthermore,
their small particle size and high EE enable functional

DOX nanoparticles to be transported into tumor tissue
and allow for greater accumulation of the nanoparticles
in tumor tissue because of the enhanced permeability
retention (EPR) effect [31]. The improved solubility of
DOX due to the lipophilic portions of α-CD and PEG in
functional nanoparticles makes it possible to avoid the
use of the anaphylactic excipient Cremophor EL. Lower
release during the initial 2 h (<30%) would be beneﬁcial
for preventing rapid leakage during the delivery and
blood/lymphatic circulation of drug-loaded nanoparticles,
thereby possibly increasing the accumulation of the drug
in tumor masses.
In the cytotoxicity assay in the present study, the
functional DOX nanoparticles exhibited the strongest
inhibitory effect on the breast cancer cells, and
particularly the resistant MCF-7/Adr cells (Fig. 3B).
The mechanism of the enhanced inhibitory effect could
involve the following factors: punctuate mitochondrial
colocalization (Fig. 4A) and higher mitochondrial uptake
(Fig. 4B). Regarding intracellular uptake by resistant
MCF-7/Adr cells, the extent of uptake was ranked as
follows: functional DOX nanoparticles > targeted DOX
nanoparticles > DOX nanoparticles > DOX·HCL > free
DOX. These results are related to the folate and DQA
added as nanoparticle-forming materials. It has been
reported that a dosage formulated with folate can bypass
P-gp function in resistant cells and to inhibit cancer cells
[32, 33]. Moreover, in the current study, the increased
solubility of DOX in the functional nanoparticles enhanced
their intracellular uptake and resulted in decreased DOX
efflux. DQA, as a mitochondria-tropic molecule with a
delocalized charge center, has been used to determine the
membrane potential of mitochondria and has been applied
to deliver DNA to the mitochondria of living cells [11];
DQA can also further promote uptake by cancer cells via
the electrostatic interaction between positively charged
functional nanoparticles and the negatively charged sites
on the tumor cell surface. Consequently, functional DOX
nanoparticles that contain DQA have a stronger inhibitory
effect on resistant MCF-7/Adr cells.
Selective drug delivery to subcellular organelles
requires an understanding of the cellular distribution
of nanoparticles. In the present study, laser confocal
microscopy analysis of live cells revealed the localization
of nanoparticles in the ER (Fig. 4C, b2-d2, br2-dr2)
and GA (Fig. 4C, b3-d3, br3-dr3) by triple labeling,
suggesting that the nanoparticles were transported to
the two suborganelles after being endocytosed intact by
the cells. In contrast, the ﬂuorescence of LysoTracker
(red) was distinct from the ﬂuorescence of 6-coumarinlabeled nanoparticles (green) (Fig. 4C, b1-d1, br1-dr1),
indicating that the nanoparticles did not localize in
lysosomes. This finding could be not attributed to the
lysosomes’ distribution of small nanoparticle in functional
nanoparticles.
Due to effect of the DQA in the functional
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

nanoparticles, the functional 6-coumarin nanoparticles
speciﬁcally accumulated in mitochondria, whereas
the 6-coumarin nanoparticles and targeted 6-coumarin
nanoparticles did not significantly accumulate in
mitochondria (Fig. 4C, d4, dr4). The mitochondrial
fraction uptake assay (Fig. 5A and B) further demonstrated
the mitochondrial targeting effect of the nanoparticles.
Specifically, the intrinsic resistance of the cancer cells
to DOX was overcome by the speciﬁc localization
of the functional nanoparticles in mitochondria. As
mitochondria-targeting DOX nanocarriers result in
robust anticancer efﬁcacy in xenografted resistant breast
cancers in mice [34], the localization of functional DOX
nanoparticles in mitochondria and the ER should promote
and enhance the pro-apoptotic action of DOX, leading to
expansion of its anticancer efﬁcacy.
The release of cytochrome C is one of the crucial
steps in deﬁning the role of mitochondria during apoptosis.
The results obtained from immunohistochemical staining
indicate that the functional DOX nanoparticles induced
signiﬁcant release of cytochrome C (Fig. 6). In contrast,
not even slight release of cytochrome C was observed for
free DOX, DOX·HCL, DOX nanoparticles, or targeted
DOX nanoparticles.
Current treatment approaches aim to induce cancer
cell apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death that is
responsible for tissue homeostasis [35-37]. The intrinsic
apoptosis pathway is initiated in mitochondria that are
permeabilized in response to intracellular death signals,
resulting in the release of cytochrome c as well as other
apoptogenic factors into the cytosol, where caspase-9 and
caspase-3 are activated [38]. Extrinsic apoptosis signaling
is initiated by the binding of death receptor ligands, such
as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) or CD95 ligand, to their cognate death receptors
at the cell membrane [39]. Fig. 8 shows that after applying
functional DOX nanoparticles, the activities of caspase-3
and caspase-9 were signiﬁcantly enhanced in both MCF-7
and MCF-7/Adr cells, further indicating the involvement
of mitochondrial signaling pathways in subsequent
apoptosis. Interestingly, the expression of caspase-3 and
caspase-9 in response to functional DOX nanoparticles
was nearly equal between MCF-7 and MCF-7/Adr cells,
suggesting that P-gp was overcome by the functional DOX
nanoparticles.
Mitochondrial apoptosis is controlled by the Bcl2 family [40]. Therapeutic strategies targeting Bcl-2
represent a promising prospect for treating many types
of cancers [41]; increased expression levels of the
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins will promote the
apoptosis of cancer cells, whereas increased expression
levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins will
preserve cell survival [42]. In the current study, enhanced
pro-apoptotic protein (Bax and Bid) expression and
reduced anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl)
expression were induced in functional DOX nanoparticle2836

treated MCF-7 and MCF-7/Adr cells (Fig. 8B). Compared
with free DOX, DOX nanoparticles, and targeted DOX
nanoparticles, functional DOX nanoparticles showed an
outcome effect. These results indicate that the functional
DOX nanoparticles could enhance the apoptosis of drugresistant MCF-7/Adr cells by activating the pro-apoptotic
proteins and suppressing the anti-apoptotic proteins in
mitochondria.
Their therapeutic efﬁcacy in the resistant MCF-7/
Adr-xenografted nude mice demonstrate that the functional
DOX nanoparticles exhibited the most signiﬁcant
antitumor activity among all formulations at comparable
doses of DOX, and the tumor growth was markedly
inhibited (Fig. 9). In the current study, the addition of
DQA and folate to the functional DOX nanoparticles
enhanced the permeability of and uptake by the resistant
tumors, which in turn enhanced cytotoxicity to the drugresistant cancer cells. Additionally, the apoptosis-inducing
effect of the functional DOX nanoparticles enhanced the
overall anticancer efﬁcacy in the drug-resistant cancer
cells. Furthermore, the functional DOX nanoparticles
improved the pharmacokinetic proﬁle of DOX due to
the use of pegylated materials [43, 44], which ultimately
resulted in higher accumulation in the tumors.

Brieﬂy, FPRs (synthesized in our laboratory) and DQA
(Hangzhou Sanhe Chemicals, Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China)
(1:0.4 molar ratio, 10 mg) were used as nanoparticleforming materials after being dissolved in 5 ml water and
stirred for 5 min. DOX hydrochloride (DOX·HCL; Beijing
Zhongshuo Pharmaceutical Technology Development Co.,
Ltd, Beijing, China) was deprotonated in water, and the pH
value was adjusted to 9.6 to obtain DOX. This DOX (2.5
mg) was then dissolved in 1 ml tetrahydrofuran (THF), and
the solution was dripped into the polyrotaxane solution
and stirred for 24 h. After the THF was volatilized, 5 ml
water was added to the mixture. Next, free DOX and the
THF were removed using a centrifugal concentrator with a
dialysis membrane (MWCO = 3000 Da). This process was
repeated three times. After the centrifugation, the solution
was freeze dried to obtain functional DOX nanoparticles.
Targeted DOX nanoparticles and non-targeted DOX
nanoparticles were prepared as controls. The targeted DOX
nanoparticles were prepared using the same procedures
as for the functional DOX nanoparticles, excluding the
addition of DQA. The non-targeted DOX nanoparticles
(drug:nanoparticle materials = 1:45, w/w) were also
prepared using the same procedures as for the functional
DOX nanoparticles, but the FPRs were replaced with
BPRs. 6-Coumarin (Sigma-Aldrich, Guangzhou, China),
rhodamine 123 (Sigma-Aldrich, Guangzhou, China) or
DiR (Invitrogen, Guangzhou, China) nanoparticles was
incorporated as a ﬂuorescent probe and prepared using the
same procedures as for the functional DOX nanoparticles.

CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, new functional DOX
nanoparticles were successfully developed to overcome
the MDR of cancers due to acquired and intrinsic drug
resistance. The functional DOX nanoparticles are small
and exhibit a high EE for DOX, and they are stable in
blood component-containing systems, with minimal
leakage. The marked efﬁcacy of the functional DOX
nanoparticles was demonstrated both by treating MCF7 breast cancer cells and resistant MCF-7/Adr cells
in vitro and by treating MCF-7 and resistant MCF-7/
Adr xenografts in nude mice. The functional DOX
nanoparticles specifically could induce apoptosis of the
drug-resistant breast cancer cells by releasing cytochrome
C and initiating a cascade of caspase-9 and caspase-3
reactions. In addition, the functional DOX nanoparticles
could cause apoptosis of the drug-resistant breast cancer
cells by activating the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and
Bid and suppressing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. Therefore, functional DOX nanoparticles have the
potential to treat drug-resistant breast cancer.

Characterization of nanoparticles
The sizes and polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of the
DOX nanoparticles, targeted DOX nanoparticles, and
functional DOX nanoparticles were measured using a
Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd,
Malvern, UK).
The size, structures and morphology of the various
types of nanoparticles, including DOX nanoparticles,
targeted DOX nanoparticles, and functional DOX
nanoparticles, were evaluated using transmission electron
microscopy (TEM; Hitachi H7650, Japan). For this
purpose, each sample (0.5 mg/ml) was resuspended in
water and mixed by ultrasonication for 30 s, after which
one drop of this suspension was placed over a carboncoated copper TEM grid (150-mesh; Sangerbio, China)
and allowed to dry at room temperature (RT). Images were
then visualized at 80 kV by TEM.
An evaluation of the encapsulation efficiency
(EE) and drug-loading content (DLC) was performed
as previously reported [21] . Brieﬂy, all types of
nanoparticles were dissolved in 3 ml DMSO to determine
their respective DLCs. The DOX concentration was then
tested using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer at 485 nm. The
DLC was calculated based on the standard curve obtained
for DOX in DMSO. The EE and DLC were specifically

calculated according to the following formulae:
EE (%) = (DOX weight measured in nanoparticles /
DOX weight added) × 100% (1)
DLC (wt%) = (DOX weight measured in
nanoparticles / (total weight of nanoparticle materials
added ± DOX weight added ) × 100% (2)

To measure the inhibitory effects of the various
DOX formulations on human breast cancer cells, MCF7 or MCF-7/Adr cells were seeded into 96-well culture
plates at 5000 cells/well and cultured at 37°C in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 24 h. The
cells were then exposed to a series of concentrations of
free DOX (DMSO ≤1%), DOX·HCL, DOX nanoparticles,
targeted DOX nanoparticles, or functional DOX
nanoparticles. Blank culture medium was used as a blank
control. After further incubation for 48 h, antiproliferative
activity was measured using a sulforhodamine B (SRB)
staining assay and a microplate reader (Bio-Rad model
680, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Shanghai, China) for
reading the absorbance at a wavelength of 540 nm, as
reported previously [23]. The survival rate was calculated
using the following formula: Survival % = (A540 nm for
the treated cells / A540 nm for the control cells) × 100%,
where A540 nm is the absorbance value. The dose-effect
curves were also plotted. All of the experiments were
performed in triplicate.

In vitro drug release
The drug-loaded nanoparticles were dispersed
and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution
to yield a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. The diluted
solution (0.5 ml) was transferred to dialysis membrane
tubes (MWCO = 3000 Da), which were then immersed in
a flask containing 25 ml PBS solution (pH 7.4) and shaken
at a speed of 100 rev/min at 37°C. A volume of 0.5 ml
release medium was sampled at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24,
30, 36, 42, and 48 h, followed by the immediate addition
of an equal volume of fresh release medium. The DOX
content was measured by UV-VIS spectrophotometry, as
described above. The release rate (RR, %) was calculated
using the formula RR = (Wi / Wtotal) / 100%, where Wi
is the measured amount of DOX in the release medium
at the time point and Wtotal is the total amount of DOX
in an equal volume of the nanoparticle suspension before
performing the release experiment. The experiment was
repeated in triplicate.

In vitro mitochondrial-targeting effects
Uptake by resistant breast cancer cells
Uptake by MCF-7 cells and MCF-7/Adr cells was
measured using a FACScan ﬂow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) [24]. Brieﬂy, MCF-7
cells or MCF-7/Adr cells were seeded into 6-well culture
plates at a density of 4x105 cells/well and cultured for 24
h in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. After
24 h of incubation, the cells were further treated with
free 6-coumarin, 6-coumarin nanoparticles or functional
6-coumarin nanoparticles for 0.5 h under the same
conditions. The ﬁnal concentration of 6-coumarin was
1.0 μM. A sample to which blank medium was added
was regarded as a control. After incubation, the cells
were washed twice with cold PBS to stop cellular uptake,
followed by treatment with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. The
amount of cellular uptake was then measured based on
the fluorescence intensity detected using a FACScan ﬂow
cytometer, with an event number of 1x104. Each assay was
repeated in triplicate.
In a qualitative study, MCF-7 or MCF-7/Adr cells
were seeded into chambered coverslips for 24 h at 37°C in
the presence of 5% CO2. After the addition of 10 µM free
rhodamine 123, rhodamine 123 nanoparticles, targeted
rhodamine 123 nanoparticles, or functional rhodamine
123 nanoparticles, the cells were further cultured for 2 h.
The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS
after the medium was removed, and the cell nuclei were
stained with Hoechst 333342 (10 µM) for 30 min. Finally,
the cells were washed twice with PBS and observed
with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica SP2,

In vitro cell culture studies

Cell lines and cell culture
MCF-7/Adr (a multidrug-resistant variant), a human
breast carcinoma cell line selected for drug resistance
to DOX, and MCF-7 (human breast cancer cells), the
parental line, were kindly donated by the Department of
Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Guangzhou Medical
University (Guangdong, China). These two cell lines are
folate receptor-overexpressing carcinoma cell lines. In
particular, MCF-7/Adr cells overexpress P-gp and exhibit
a drug-resistant phenotype in vitro and in vivo when grown
in Balb/c mice. In several studies, MCF-7 cells have been
used as drug-sensitive controls. In the present study, the
two cell lines were grown in 75 cm3 ﬂasks containing
folate-free RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine medium (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100
mg/ml streptomycin and maintained in an incubator with
a humidiﬁed 5% CO2/95% atmosphere at 37°C. Cells
grown to conﬂuence were subcultured every other day by
trypsinization with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and dilution (1/3)
in fresh growth medium.

Subcellular localization in resistant breast cancer
cells

Release of cytochrome C
The release of cytochrome C from MCF-7/Adr
cells’ mitochondria into the cytosol was measured using
a streptavidin-peroxidase immunohistochemical kit
(Zhongshan Goldenbridge Biotechnology, Co., Ltd,
Beijing, China) [26]. Brieﬂy, after incubation for 24
h, MCF-7/Adr cells were exposed to free DOX, DOX
nanoparticles, targeted DOX nanoparticles or functional
6-coumarin nanoparticles or fresh medium as a control.
The ﬁnal concentration of DOX was 2 µM. After
incubation for another 12 h, the cells were sequentially
treated with 3% H2O2, blocking buffer (provided in the
kit), the primary antibody (anti-cytochrome C; Nanjing
KeyGen Biotechnology, Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China), an
enhanced secondary antibody (provided in the kit) and
an enhanced streptavidin-HRP conjugate (provided in the
kit). After color development, the release of cytochrome C
was observed under a light microscope.

Subcellular localization in resistant breast
cancer cells was measured using a laser scanning
confocal microscope, as previously described [25]. The
localization of 6-coumarin or various types of 6-coumarin
nanoparticles in subcellular organelles was observed
by labeling the cells with ﬂuorescent probes speciﬁc to
organelle markers, such as LysoTracker, MitoTracker, ERTracker or a Golgi marker (all from Invitrogen, China). In
particular, MCF-7 or MCF-7/Adr cells were seeded into
chambered coverslips and cultured for 24 h at 37°C in
the presence of 5% CO2, followed by the addition of 1.0
μM free 6-coumarin, 6-coumarin nanoparticles, targeted
6-coumarin nanoparticles or functional 6-coumarin
nanoparticles. After the cells were further incubated for
4 h, the drug-containing medium was removed, and the
cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The
cells were then stained with organelle-selective dye
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). More specifically,
lysosomes, mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and the Golgi apparatus (GA) were visualized by
staining the cells with 50 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99,
200 nM MitoTracker Deep Red FM, 1 µM ER-Tracker
Red (BODIPY TR glibenclamide) or 5 µM BODIPY TR
ceramide complexed to BSA, respectively, for 30 min.
The cells loaded with organelle markers were washed
with PBS, and the cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst
333342 (10 µM) for 30 min. The cells were then washed
twice with PBS and observed with a laser scanning
confocal microscope.

Caspase activation
MCF-7/Adr cells were cultured for 12 h and then
treated with free DOX, DOX nanoparticles, targeted
DOX nanoparticles or functional DOX nanoparticles.
Controls were performed by adding blank medium. The
ﬁnal concentration of DOX was 2 µM. After 12 h of
incubation, the cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed
by western blotting. The following antibodies were used:
anti-caspase-8, anti-caspase-9, anti-caspase-3, and antiPARP (all from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) [27].

In vitro apoptosis-inducing effect

Drug content in the mitochondrial fraction

Apoptosis rates were measured using a FITCannexin V staining kit and a FACScan ﬂow cytometer.
The procedure was performed according to the guide
accompanying the apoptosis detection kit (Biosea
Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China). Brieﬂy, MCF-7
or MCF-7/Adr cells were seeded into 6-well culture plates
at a density of 5x105 cells/well in 2 ml growth medium.
After 24 h, the cells were treated with fresh medium (as a
blank control), free DOX, targeted DOX nanoparticles or
functional DOX nanoparticles for 12 h in an atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. The concentration of DOX
was 2 µM. The cells were then harvested and suspended in
the provided binding buffer, and 5 µl annexin V-FITC was
added to the cell suspensions. This mixture was incubated
at RT in the dark for 15 min, and then 5 µl propidium
iodide (PI; provided in the kit) was added. Finally, the cell
samples were analyzed using an FC500 ﬂow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter) using the FL1 and FL4 channels for

The drug content in the isolated mitochondrial
fraction was measured using a FACScan ﬂow
cytometer. MCF-7 or MCF-7/Adr cells were first
cultured and then treated with 6-coumarin, 6-coumarin
nanoparticles, targeted 6-coumarin nanoparticles or
functional 6-coumarin nanoparticles for 6 h at a ﬁnal
6-coumarin concentration of 10 µM. Mitochondria
were isolated according to the guide accompanying the
cell mitochondria isolation kit (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Haimen, China). Brieﬂy, the cells were
reacted with mitochondria extraction reagent (provided
in the kit) and stirred in a homogenizer. The suspensions
were then centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min, after which
the supernatants were collected and further centrifuged at
3500 g for 10 min. The mitochondria were collected from
the precipitates, and a FACScan ﬂow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson FACSCalibur, Mountain View, CA, USA) was
used to quantify the drug content in the mitochondrial

Female Balb/c nude mice (initially weighing 1820 g and obtained from Southern Medical University
Health Science Center) were used to investigate antitumor
efﬁcacy in vivo. All animal experiments were performed
according to the institutional and National Institutes
of Health guidelines for the care and use of research
animals. Brieﬂy, approximately 1x107 MCF-7/Adr cells
were suspended in 200 µl serum-free RPMI-1640 culture
medium and injected subcutaneously into the right
ﬂanks of the nude mice [31]. When the tumors reached a
volume of 200-230 mm3, the mice were randomly divided
into five groups (5 animals each). In each group, one
formulation (DOX·HCL, DOX nanoparticles, targeted
DOX nanoparticles or functional DOX nanoparticles) was
injected intravenously via the tail vein, with a dose of 5
mg of DOX per kg of body weight. In total, five injections
were performed at 4-day intervals. The mice were then
monitored every other day for tumor progression with a
caliper and for weight change with a weighing scale. The
tumor volume was calculated using the following formula:
(width2 × length / 2). The rate of inhibition of tumor
growth at day 36 was calculated using the formula Rv =
100% - (Vdrug / Vsaline) × 100%, where Vdrug is the tumor
volume after treatment with the drug and Vsaline is the
tumor volume after treatment with physiological saline.
