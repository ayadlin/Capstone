Targeting SHP2 phosphatase in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
Raghuveer Singh Mali, Rebecca Chan and Reuben Kapur
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are
clonal hematologic disorders which result in enhanced
production of immature and mature myeloid lineagederived cells. Included in this category are the nonclassical MPNs, systemic mastocytosis (SM) and juvenile
myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)[1]. Activating
mutations of KIT (KITD816V in humans and KITD814V
in mice), encoding the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF),
are found in over 90% of patients with SM[2]. Activating
mutations of PTPN11, encoding the protein tyrosine
phosphatase, Shp2, are found in 35% of patients with
JMML, and children bearing PTPN11 mutations suffer a
particularly poor prognosis. Somatic oncogenic PTPN11
and KIT mutations are also found in myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
and core binding factor-acute myeloid leukemia (CBFAML). SM is characterized as a clonal expansion of
myelomastocytic progenitors within tissues eventually
resulting in organ failure and death[2], and no curative
therapies are currently available. Importantly, targeting
the activated version of KITD814V receptor alone has
been largely ineffective; therefore, targeting downstream
signaling pathways from KIT is likely to be a prudent
therapeutic approach for treating SM. Likewise, JMML
is a difficult-to-treat childhood MPN characterized by
hematopoietic progenitor hypersensitivity to granulocyte
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The
only curative therapy is allogeneic hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation; however, approximately half of the
children will relapse after this aggressive therapeutic
intervention.
While it is clear that Shp2 gain of function (GOF)
mutations contribute to non-classical MPN; wildtype
(WT) Shp2 is also overexpressed and hyperactive in
MPNs including in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
and more recently in cells bearing an oncogenic form of
KIT (KITD816V/KITD814V) associated with SM[3].
Therefore, targeting Shp2 is likely to be of therapeutic
benefit not only for treating JMML but also for diseases
bearing an oncogenic form of KIT including SM.
However, targeting Shp2 with small molecule inhibitors
has been challenging, in part due to conservation of
the active site pocket, which is shared between several
other members of the tyrosine phosphatase family.
Recent studies have described the characterization and
functional efficacy of some Shp2 inhibitors. To this end,
NSC-87877 was described as a Shp2 inhibitor; however,
it also demonstrates activity towards the related protein
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tyrosine phosphatase, SHP1[4]. PHPS1 demonstrates
specificity for Shp2 over Shp1[5]. Additional small
molecule inhibitors of Shp2 have also been described that
show in vitro functional efficacy, although at very high
concentrations[6]. More recently, Zhang et al described
a salicyclic acid based Shp2 inhibitor, IIB08[7]. IIB08
binds both the active site of Shp2 as well as the adjacent
spanning sub-pockets and demonstrates enhanced overall
affinity and selectivity for Shp2. Early in vitro studies
showed that IIB08 inhibits GM-CSF induced growth of
bone marrow cells bearing GOF Shp2 mutations (D61Y
and E76K) commonly found in patients with JMML[7].
More recently, Mali et al extended these findings to
demonstrate that IIB08 treatment of cells bearing an
oncogenic form of KIT (KITD814V) results in reduced
Shp2 constitutive phosphorylation, repression in ligand
independent growth and survival[3]. Importantly, they also
demonstrated that complete deficiency of Shp2 in bone
marrow cells bearing the oncogenic KIT phenocopies
the observed growth repression seen in the presence of
IIB08. Biochemically, the authors showed that constitutive
binding of Shp2 to p85α regulatory subunit of class IA
PI3Kinase and Gab2 in KITD814V expressing cells is
significantly disrupted in the presence of IIB08 resulting in
reduced activation of AKT and ERK MAPK. In vivo, mice
bearing KITD814V expressing cells had enhanced survival
when treated with IIB08, which was further prolonged
when these mice were treated with a combination of IIB08
and a PI3Kinase inhibitor, suggesting that targeting Shp2
in vivo in combination with a PI3Kinase inhibitor is likely
to be of therapeutic benefit for some MPNs[3].
While identifying Shp2 as a potential therapeutic
target for treating KITD814V bearing MPNs is exciting;
identifying the appropriate cellular populations that need
targeting in SM is equally crucial. SM is a heterogeneous
disease. In addition to assuming an indolent course, SM
can also take an aggressive direction (as in aggressive
systemic mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia) or can be
associated with a non-mast cell hematologic malignancy
(associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage
disease, SMAHNMD)[2]. Although at present it is
unclear how a single mutation results in such diverse
cellular outcomes; somatic oncogenic KIT mutations
associated with mastocytosis have been identified in
relatively primitive stem and progenitor cells as well as
in more mature mast cells. Given the fact that Shp2 is
expressed in both primitive hematopoietic progenitors
and committed mast cells[3, 8], genetic studies involving

the deletion of Shp2 in relevant cell types to identify
whether Shp2 plays quantitatively or qualitatively
distinct role in regulating oncogenic KIT-induced disease
heterogeneity will be essential. To this end, Gerbaulet et
al[9] have recently described a mouse model driven by
an inducible expression of KITD814V, which mimics
several cardinal features of human mastocytosis including
cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) as well as SM. This model
permits the examination and pathologic consequences
of KITD814V expression in immature hematopoietic
progenitors (relevant for SM) vs. that of committed mast
cells (relevant for cutaneous mastocytosis). Utilizing this
model and conditionally deleting Shp2 in stem cells vs.
mast cells should provide a clearer picture with respect to
the precise role Shp2 plays in KITD814V induced disease
heterogeneity (Figure 1).
In addition to identifying the appropriate cellular
population(s) for targeting Shp2 in MPNs, it will be
essential to determine if hyperactive WT Shp2 similarly
contributes to MPN as GOF Shp2. This is an important
issue, since the structural requirements and substrate
specificity of GOF Shp2 could be different from that
of a hyperactive form of WT Shp2 and, thus, targeting

Shp2 in different MPNs may require different strategies.
Shp2 comprises of several functional domains, including
N- and C-SH2 domains, a PTP domain and C-terminal
tyrosine (542 and 580) residues. While the phosphatase
function of Shp2 has been shown to be important for Ras
activation, germline PTPN11 mutations causing loss of
phosphatase activity yield similar phenotypic anomalies
to that induced by germline GOF PTPN11 mutations,
exemplified by individuals with LEOPARD syndrome
and Noonan syndrome, respectively[10]. Consistently,
structure-function studies performed in Shp2-deficient
zebrafish embryos demonstrate that Shp2 possesses
both phosphatase-dependent and -independent roles
in regulating neural crest specification, migration, and
apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK activity did not
result in cell death, suggesting that Shp2-induced ERK
activation may not be essential for survival. It is quite
possible that Shp2 molecules bearing a GOF mutation,
rendering a constitutively open conformation, results
in both quantitative as well as qualitative differences
in the utilization of its SH2 domains, PTP domain, and
C-terminal tyrosine residues (Y542 and Y580) compared
to WT Shp2 activated in response to oncogenic KIT. It

is important to identify the individual role(s) of these
domains in transformation, as targeting specific domains
of Shp2 as opposed to inhibiting only the phosphatase
function is likely to be a more prudent approach for
treating diseases involving abnormal Shp2. Taken
together, a combined understanding of Shp2’s structural
requirement as well as defining the appropriate cellular
population(s) for targeting Shp2 is likely to aid in the
design of better Shp2 inhibitors in the future.
