BACKGROUND: The categories of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria for multiple myeloma are
based on the magnitude of the change in paraprotein and the normalization of the free light chain ratio (rFLC). However, the relationship between the response by these biomarkers and clinical outcomes has not been validated with novel compounds in the phase 1
setting. Early response predictors may have prognostic value and speed development plans for new agents. METHODS: The relationship between biomarkers of response and clinical outcomes was examined in 87 relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients enrolled in nontransplant phase I clinical trials from January 2004 through November 2011 at 4 time landmarks. Progression-free
survival (PFS) was the primary outcome, and overall survival (OS) was also assessed. RESULTS: The normalization of rFLC within 4
months predicted improvement in PFS (11.3 vs 2.8 months, P 5.038), whereas the normalization of rFLC within 12 months predicted
improvement in PFS (6.1 vs 2.8 months, P 5.015) and OS (45 vs 17.4 months, P 5.002). The magnitude of response in paraprotein predicted and correlated linearly with PFS at all time landmarks (R2 5 0.703-0.943) when it was assessed with 2 different boundaries.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the normalization of rFLC and the magnitude of response are viable biomarkers for surrogate endpoints in early-phase clinical trials, validate the use of current IMWG response criteria in the phase 1 setting, and support

INTRODUCTION
The US Food and Drug Administration may grant accelerated approval of a cancer drug or biologic on the basis of its
effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to be associated with clinical benefits. Clinical benefits can include
improved overall survival (OS) and symptom improvement (eg, reduced pain, fewer transfusions, and improved quality
of life) but also may include endpoints based on disease response such as progression-free survival (PFS) and effects on
established surrogate endpoints. Biomarkers have not traditionally served as primary endpoints for cancer drug approval
because of a lack of association with clinical benefits. Conversely, medications used to treat chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease may be approved on the basis of reductions in surrogate endpoints (eg, blood pressure and serum cholesterol) that are known to confer a clinical benefit.1 Biomarkers of the plasma cell burden such as serum paraprotein,
urine paraprotein, free light chains (FLCs), and the free light chain ratio (rFLC; defined as j/k), in conjunction with a
bone marrow evaluation for clonal plasma cells, form the basis of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)
response criteria for multiple myeloma.2 PFS, moreover, has been considered a suitable surrogate marker for OS in myeloma on the basis of previous clinical trial data.2,3 Dramatic improvements in OS have been seen over the last decade in

patients with multiple myeloma, with an increase in the
historic median OS from 2 to 3 years to greater than 5 to
7 years. In the fast-paced, rapidly changing drug development environment of myeloma, it is important to be able
to assess the clinical benefits of drugs in the setting of early
phase 1 testing, but traditional response criteria have not
been fully validated in this setting.
A majority of patients with multiple myeloma and
related plasma cell disorders have an abnormal rFLC.4 An
abnormal baseline rFLC is a predictor of progression to
multiple myeloma in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance,5,6 smoldering myeloma,7,8 and solitary plasmacytoma,9 and it confers a
worse prognosis to patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma or newly diagnosed amyloidosis.10-12 The
prognostic significance of the normalization of rFLC,
incorporated into the IMWG definition of a stringent
complete response, is less well studied, and conflicting
results have been yielded in the pretransplant13,14 and
posttransplant settings15-17 among patients with plasma
cell malignancies. More importantly, we lack a prognostic
value for the timing of the normalization of rFLC in the
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma setting.
In a recent analysis of phase 1 studies involving solid
tumors, using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors, the authors demonstrated that the boundaries
for response categories were arbitrary and that percent
changes in tumor measurements correlated linearly with
survival.18 Similarly, in myeloma, Bruno et al recently
developed a model for multiple myeloma from phase 3
data19,20 and applied it to a phase 1/2 study to evaluate
the relationship of tumor burden reduction (as assessed
from changes in serum paraprotein from the baseline to 8
weeks) with OS and PFS.21 Interestingly, the PFS predicted by the model and the actual PFS were similar.
These results suggest that change in paraprotein as a continuous, longitudinal biomarker appears to be a potential
indicator for assessing drug effects in myeloma studies.
We examined the relationship between PFS and
changes in disease as quantified by the rFLC and the magnitude of response in serum/urine paraprotein and serum
FLCs. We also examined the magnitude of response as a
continuous, longitudinal biomarker for prognostication
as categorized by the IMWG criteria and by an alternative
classification. In addition, we investigated the relationship
between OS and disease burden, and we examined prognostication at different time landmarks to assess the normalization of rFLC and the magnitude of response as
biomarkers and thus surrogate endpoints of survival and
clinical benefit.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient and Study Selection

Myeloma patients who were enrolled in a phase 1 clinical
trial at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University
for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma from January 1,
2004 through November 30, 2011 were eligible for inclusion in the analyses. The OnCore Clinical Trials software
system, version 12.0.3 (Forte Research Systems, Madison,
Wis), was used to identify studies meeting the selection criteria as detailed in the flow chart in Supporting Figure 1 (see
online supporting information). This study was approved
by the clinical and translational research committee of the
Winship Cancer Institute and by the institutional review
board of Emory University, and a waiver requirement for
informed consent and documentation was granted. Approvals and waivers were obtained before data collection.
Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, and
they encompassed 251 nonmutually exclusive clinical trial
enrollees. Patients were excluded from the analyses if they
received their first dose of the study drug after November
30, 2011, received less than 1 cycle of therapy, had a nonmyeloma malignancy, were part of the phase 2 arm of a
phase 1/2 study, were enrolled in a previous phase 1 nontransplant trial and received the study drug, or had missing
data. Eighty-seven patients meeting the inclusion criteria
were included in the analyses, and they represented 19
phase 1 studies. Patients who had a normal rFLC at the
baseline were excluded from the analyses of the normalization of rFLC, and patients who had nonsecretory disease2
were excluded from the magnitude-of-response analyses.
Reasons for study and patient exclusion and treatment
types can be found in Supporting Figure 1 and Supporting
Table 1, respectively (see online supporting information).
Data and Endpoints

Clinical and demographic data were collected through the
interrogation of electronic medical records. Response criteria were verified according to IMWG criteria, and mortality data were accessed from the OnCore database and
cross-verified with the Social Security death appendix
(http://www.dobsearch.com/). The date of last follow-up
was truncated at November 30, 2011 to allow a minimum
of 12 months of follow-up for each patient. Patients with
t(4;14), deletion 13, deletion 17p, t(14;16), or t(14;20)
were considered to have non–standard-risk cytogenetics.22-24 Baseline values and best responses for rFLC, serum paraprotein, urine paraprotein, and the difference
between involved and uninvolved FLCs at each of the 4
time landmarks (cycle 2 and 4, 8, and 12 months after the
first dose of the study drug) were recorded. The range of

normal rFLCs was considered to be 0.26 to 1.65 in accordance with current guidelines and our institutional
assay.4 The magnitude of response was defined as the best
percent change in the primary disease marker (serum paraprotein, urine paraprotein, or difference between
involved and uninvolved FLCs) from the baseline.2 The
primary endpoint of interest was PFS. Standard definitions were used for PFS and OS.2
Statistical Analysis

The analysis was separated into 2 parts: normalization of
rFLC and magnitude of response. Patient characteristics
were compared between groups with the chi-square or
Fisher exact test for categorical covariates and with an
analysis of variance, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, or the
Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. OS and PFS
were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method. The logrank test was used to assess the differences in OS and PFS
between different groups of patients at each time landmark. The magnitude-of-response data were stratified on
the basis of the primary disease marker and were examined

with thresholds in accordance with the IMWG criteria2
and also at 50% increments. The median OS and PFS values for each group of patients were plotted against the
mean percent change in paraprotein for the group, best fit
lines were calculated with the least square fit, and linearity
was assessed with the correlation coefficient (R2).
Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to estimate the effects of the covariates as well as markers of
plasma cell activity at each time landmark on OS and PFS
after adjustments for covariates with a P value < .1 in univariate analyses. Backward variable selection with an a
level of removal of .05 was used to identify the best predictive model of OS and PFS. All analyses were performed
with SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) and R package version 2.15.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with a significance level of .05.

analyses. Seven patients had an absence of secretory disease
and were excluded from the analyses (Supporting Figure 1
[see online supporting information]). In the magnitude-ofresponse analyses, 80 patients were analyzed. A majority of
the patients had serum paraprotein as their primary disease
marker (n 5 56), with 6 patients having FLC disease only
and 18 patients having urine paraprotein as their primary
disease marker. In the rFLC analyses, 12 patients were
excluded for missing data, and 4 patients were excluded for
normal rFLCs at the baseline; 71 patients met the inclusion
criteria and were assessed for outcomes (Supporting Figure
1 [see online supporting information]).
Approximately one-third of the patients were African American, and approximately one-fourth had nonstandard cytogenetics at study entry. The median age of
the patients at the time of study entry was 62 years (range,
42-80 years). A majority of the patients had a history of at
least 1 hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The study population was heavily pretreated with a median number of
previous lines of therapy of 5 (range, 1-11). The median
time from diagnosis to phase 1 trial enrollment was 4.67
years. Only 7% of the patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 at enrollment. The median time in the phase 1 study was 5
months (range, 0.69-65.82 months), and patients
received a median of 2 lines of therapy after phase 1 study
discontinuation (range, 0-12).
Prognostic Impact of Normalization of rFLC

As illustrated in Figure 1B, the normalization of rFLC
within the first 4 months after study initiation significantly prolonged PFS in comparison with PFS for patients
whose rFLC did not normalize (11.3 vs 2.8 months,
P 5 .038). The normalization of rFLC within 12 months
conferred significantly better PFS (6.1 vs 2.8 months,
P 5 .015) and OS (45 vs 17.4 months, P 5 .002) in comparison with those for patients whose rFLC did not normalize (Figs. 1D and 2D, respectively). Observationally,
patients whose rFLC normalized earlier by cycle 2 or 4
months had a more favorable PFS than those whose rFLC
normalized thereafter (Table 2 and Fig. 1).

strongly linear when it was analyzed with 50% response
boundaries versus IMWG boundaries of response at 4
(R2 5 0.882 vs R2 5 0.876, respectively), 8 (R2 5 0.927
vs R2 5 0.842, respectively), and 12 months (R2 5 0.943
vs R2 5 0.848, respectively). As shown in Supporting Table 2 (see online supporting information), the magnitude
of response was also predictive of OS when patients were
analyzed with boundaries of 50% changes in disease
markers at 4 (P 5 .046) and 8 months (P 5 .032). The
magnitude of response was also predictive of OS at the
12-month time landmark when it was analyzed with both
the IMWG response boundaries (P 5 .019) and the 50%
response boundaries (P 5 .002), but the correlation was
found to be stronger at 12 months when it was analyzed
with the 50% response boundaries versus the IMWG
boundaries (R2 5 0.923 vs R2 5 0.676), as displayed in
Figure 3 and Supporting Table 2 (see online supporting
information). A correlation with the magnitude of
response and OS was not found to be strongly linear at
any other time landmark (R2 < 0.7 for cycle 2, 4 months,
and 8 months; Supporting Table 2 [see online supporting
information]).
Prognostic Impact of Covariates According to
Univariate and Multivariate Analyses

Univariate and multivariate analyses of 11 covariates that
may affect PFS and OS were performed and are outlined
in detail in Supporting Tables 3 to 9 (see online supporting information). No covariates were found to be independently predictive of the primary endpoint PFS in any
of the multivariate analyses of the normalization of rFLC
or the magnitude of response (Supporting Tables 4, 6,
and 8 [see online supporting information]). The prognostic impact of covariates on OS in the multivariate analyses
did not show consistent results (Supporting Tables 5, 7,
and 9, [see online supporting information]). The significant results in the univariate analysis (Supporting Table 3
[see online supporting information]) did not consistently
hold in the multivariate analyses. The lack of consistent
prognostication of covariates in these analyses could be
due to small study numbers, and the interpretation of the
results is limited.

Prognostic Impact of Magnitude of Response

The depth of response, both as defined by the IMWG criteria and when examined with 50% response boundaries,
was significantly correlated in a linear fashion with PFS
across all time landmarks (P < .001 for all): patients who
had a deeper response in their disease marker had a longer
median PFS (Supporting Table 2 [see online supporting
information]). The relationship was found to be more

DISCUSSION
Novel therapies have been associated with a significant
improvement in OS in patients with relapsed multiple
myeloma diagnosed after 2001 versus those diagnosed in
the preceding decade.25 We set forth to validate responses
and clinical benefits in the phase 1 relapsed/refractory setting of novel therapies or novel combinations in myeloma.

perhaps most importantly, we looked at multiple sequential time landmarks. The principal findings included a
statistically significant improvement in PFS after 4 and 12
months of phase 1 treatment and prolonged OS after 12
months in patients who had a normal rFLC versus those
who did not, and a quicker normalization of rFLC conveyed a more favorable prognosis for PFS. The magnitude

of response in paraprotein was found to correlate linearly
with PFS at all time landmarks in accordance with the
IMWG thresholds and also at 50% thresholds. In addition, the magnitude of response in paraprotein was found
to significantly correlate with OS after 12 months. This
association was strongly linear when it was examined with

the 50% thresholds of response and was moderately linear
when it was examined with the IMWG thresholds. This is
the first study, to our knowledge, that demonstrates an
association between biomarkers of response and PFS and

patients.

Recently, the normalization of rFLC in patients
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with regimens containing thalidomide (48%), lenalidomide
(34%), or bortezomib (83%) was shown to confer a superior benefit in PFS and OS in comparison with patients
whose rFLC did not normalize.14 However, the extrapolation of these results in the phase 1 setting of novel therapies was unknown. This is even more important as the
depth of response in refractory myeloma has not been correlated with prolonged PFS or OS. Our results support
these conclusions in the phase 1 relapsed/refractory setting: we have shown improved PFS and OS rates across all
time landmarks in patients achieving a normal rFLC. It is
possible that a lack of significance after cycles 2 and 8
could be secondary to the small sample size. Fewer
patients in the current study received a proteasome inhibitor (49%) or an immunomodulator (immunomodulatory
drug; 19%) as part of their phase 1 treatment, yet the benefit of normalization of rFLC held in the setting of novel
therapies. Our results and the results of Iwama et al14 are
in contrast to previously reported data for the newly diagnosed population in which the attainment of a stringent
complete response (complete response 1 normal rFLC)
or a partial response with a normal rFLC conveyed no
benefit in PFS or OS in comparison with the attainment
of a complete response or a partial response without a normal rFLC.13 The latter study was limited by the assessment of rFLC in individuals who solely achieved at least a
partial response; however, more patients in the latter study
versus the current study achieved a normal rFLC.
Giarin et al15 found that normalization of rFLC 3
months after transplantation had no effect on event-free
survival or OS in newly diagnosed myeloma patients.
This study was limited by the observation of a single time
point and a lack of a pretransplant baseline rFLC and subsequent measures of effects of transplantation on rFLC. In
contrast, all patients included in the normalization analysis in the current study had an abnormal rFLC at the baseline of study entry. Because transplant trials were excluded
Cancer

March 15, 2015

from our analysis, conclusions regarding the predictive
capabilities of the normalization of rFLC in response to
transplantation cannot be drawn.
We also demonstrated that patients whose rFLC
normalized at or before 4 months in the study had a more
favorable prognosis with a longer PFS than patients whose
rFLC subsequently normalized thereafter, but this effect
did not translate into improved OS. Patients whose rFLC
did not normalize within 4 months might benefit from
add-on therapy or a different treatment regimen entirely.
It would be prudent to consider this finding in the design
of future phase 1 studies.
Our results regarding the magnitude of response
and the prediction of survival are in contrast to previous
findings in the upfront setting.26-30 However, these studies were not performed in the era of novel therapies or
proteasome inhibition, were before the time of the
IMWG criteria, and did not examine PFS. Our results
support the findings of Bruno et al21 in that changes in
the paraprotein level in a continuous, longitudinal fashion correlated linearly with PFS and OS. We expanded
the study to show that this effect was preserved beyond
cycle 2. We also included patients whose primary disease
marker was not necessarily serum paraprotein. In addition, our findings parallel the results recently presented
by Jain et al18 in the solid tumor phase 1 setting with
respect to PFS being the primary outcome of interest in
multiple myeloma. The strong linear correlation with
the magnitude of response and PFS raises the question
whether the current boundaries of response categories in
the IMWG criteria are meaningful, especially in the
phase 1 setting. Interestingly, the magnitude of response
by 50% increments was found to additionally predict
OS after 4 and 8 months, whereas the magnitude of
response by the IMWG criteria was not, although neither was strongly linear in nature. It appears that the
50% increment brackets were more predictive than the
current thresholds set forth by the IMWG for OS.
Refinement of the criteria appears warranted.

Unlike the normalization of rFLC, early magnitude
of response in paraprotein does not appear to convey a
more favorable prognosis for PFS or OS than a later
response. This could in part be explained by the relatively
short half-life of FLCs in comparison with intact immunoglobulin.4 Thus, the effects of drug therapy on intact
860

paraproteins could be masked in a narrow time period,
and this might also account for the lack of a statistically
significant benefit in OS after cycle 2 in the current analysis of the magnitude of response. The normalization of
the rFLC may provide an earlier signal of drug activity
than the magnitude of response in paraproteins and may

impossible to analyze these patients because of the nature of
the study, the hypothetical inclusion of the death endpoints
could have given an unfair bias to the group of patients
who had a response. Seven patients with nonsecretory disease who were excluded from the magnitude-of-response
analysis were included in the normalization analysis. The
rFLC may be an important indicator of response in patients

with nonsecretory disease. The current study is limited by
its retrospective nature, small sample size, and single-center
design. In addition, we excluded transplant-based phase 1
studies, although the intent of the current study was to
assess novel therapies that might in the future prolong the
time to transplantation or eliminate its necessity altogether.
Lastly, we examined only response and progression during
a 12-month period of time. The strength of the current
study might be enhanced with longer follow-up.
In conclusion, our results support the inclusion of
rFLC and magnitude of response in the IMWG criteria

and the utilization of such in the phase 1 setting of relapsed
or refractory myeloma. However, further refinement of the
IMWG criteria appears warranted. We have shown that the
magnitude of response and the normalization of rFLC are
valid surrogates of PFS and OS and, therefore, clinical benefit in phase 1 relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
patients and are useful markers for moving investigational
agents and combinations to phase 2 trials en route to Food
and Drug Administration approval.
