ABSTRACT
The abundance of the BCR/ABL protein critically contributes to CML pathogenesis
and drug resistance. However, understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying
BCR/ABL gene regulation remains incomplete. While BCR/ABL kinase inhibitors have
shown unprecedented efficacy in the clinic, most patients relapse. In this study, we
demonstrated that the Sp1 oncogene functions as a positive regulator for BCR/ABL
expression. Inactivation of Sp1 by genetic and pharmacological approaches abrogated
BCR/ABL expression, leading to suppression of BCR/ABL kinase signaling and CML
cell proliferation. Because of potential adverse side effects of bortezomib (BORT) in
imatinib-refractory CML patients, we designed a transferrin (Tf)-targeted liposomal
formulation (Tf-L-BORT) for BORT delivery. Cellular uptake assays showed that BORT
was efficiently delivered into K562 cells, with the highest efficacy obtained in Tftargeted group. After administered into mice, L-BORT exhibited slower clearance
with less toxicity compared to free BORT. Furthermore, L-BORT exposure significantly
blocked BCR/ABL kinase activities and sensitized CML cell lines, tumor cells and
doxorubicin (DOX) resistant cells to DOX. This occurred through the more pronounced
inhibition of BCR/ABL activity by L-BORT and DOX. Collectively, these findings
highlight the therapeutic relevance of disrupting BCR/ABL protein expression and
strongly support the utilization of L-BORT alone or in combination with DOX to treat
CML patients with overexpressing BCR/ABL.

is found in nearly all CML patients [1, 2] and plays a
central role in CML pathogenesis [3–5]. Tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated remarkable clinical
efficacy in nearly all chronic phase CML patients [5–7].
However, serious problems arise from TKI therapy,
including drug resistance, partial eradication of BCR/
ABL-expressing cells and limited effect on the quiescent
Ph+ stem cells [8]. TKI resistance in CML is primarily
caused by the re-establishment of hyperactive ABL

INTRODUCTION
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a
myeloproliferative neoplasm representing about 15-20%
of all cases of adult leukemia in Western populations.
The t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome translocation fuses
the BCR gene to the c-ABL proto-oncogene resulting
in a chimeric BCR/ABL protein, a constitutively active

kinase either through acquired mutations in the BCR/
ABL kinase domain or its gene amplification [9–11]. In
addition, elevated BCR/ABL protein expression is found
during the blast crisis phase of CML [12] and in a subset
of relapsed CML patients [11, 13]. BCR/ABL expression
level also significantly influences the development
of BCR/ABL point mutations [12]. These findings,
collectively, support the idea that BCR/ABL protein
expression could be a promising target for overriding
aberrant ABL kinase activity. Thus, to successfully
treat resistant CML, alternative strategies are highly
desirable to target BCR/ABL expression and its gene
regulators with approaches distinct from those employed
by conventional tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Because BCR/ABL promotes proteasome-dependent
degradation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) [14],
bortezomib (BORT), a proteasome inhibitor, was used
to block BCR/ABL activity in order to restore TSG
expression in vitro and in vivo. However, in a pilot clinical
trial, BORT was found to have minimal efficacy and
considerable toxicity in imatinib-refractory CML patients
[15]. The suboptimal clinical performance (e.g., significant
dose-related toxicity) and the lack of a sufficient
therapeutic index calls for new therapeutic approaches that
could include different drug targets and/or more efficient
delivery vehicles, such as liposomes. Developing a slowrelease formulation, such as liposomes, can potentially
lead to reduced off-target toxicity and a higher therapeutic
index [16].
Liposomes are composed of lipid bilayers and are
capable of carrying both hydrophobic drugs. The low
production cost, flexibility to carry drugs with various
physical chemical properties, low immunogenicity
and apparent enhanced drug delivery efficiencies have
made liposomes a popular drug delivery carrier. The
marketed liposomal drugs, doxorubicin (DOXIL) [17]
and daunorubicin (DaunoXome), have also addressed
the serious side effects in the form of dose-limiting
cardiotoxicity. Further, the specificity of drug delivery
can be increased by coating drug-loaded liposomes
with ligands targeting specific cell surface markers, like
transferrin receptor (TfR), whose expression is increased
in CML cells.
In this study, we designed a liposomal formulation
of BORT (L-BORT) and its TfR-targeted derivative and
characterized its physicochemical properties and ability
to deliver the drug to target cells and pharmacokinetic
(PK) properties in mice. We assessed its therapeutic
potential in CML cell lines, single tumor cells and DOX
resistant cells. We demonstrated that BCR/ABL protein
expression is positively regulated by Sp1 and in parallel
with its kinase activity. Disruption of the Sp1-BCR/ABL
axis by Sp1 siRNA, miR-29b and BORT impaired BCR/
ABL kinase signaling leading to the blockage of CML cell
proliferation. L-BORT achieved enhanced BORT delivery
efficiency, improved pharmacokinetic performance,

RESULTS
Sp1 inhibition by BORT suppresses BCR/ABL
kinase signaling
To elucidate the mechanisms underlying BCR/
ABL gene expression, we analyzed its promoter region
and identified several putative Sp1 binding sites. We
performed electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSA)
with nuclear extract (NE) prepared from K562 cells
and probes (hBCR1 and hBCR2) spanning the BCR/
ABL promoter regions containing Sp1-binding sites.
The 32P-lableled hBCR1 and hBCR2 probes yielded
slower migrating DNA-protein complexes (Figure 1A,
lane 2). The specificity of DNA-protein interactions was
demonstrated by competition assays with 20- and 50-fold
excess unlabeled BCR/ABL promoter probes (cold DNA),
in which the unlabeled DNA oligos containing the Sp1binding sites efficiently and dose-dependently competed
away protein binding to both probes (Figure 1A, lanes 3
and 4). In contrast, cold non-specific (n.s.) probes did not
significantly impact the formation of Sp1-DNA complex
(Figure 1A, lane 5). These data, collectively, suggest a
specific interaction between BCR/ABL promoter and Sp1
protein.
To determine whether Sp1 enrichment on BCR/ABL
promoter contributes to BCR/ABL expression, we silenced
Sp1 expression in K562 and KU812 cells by transfecting
a pool of four siRNAs that targeted different regions
of the Sp1 transcripts. As expected, siRNA-triggered
Sp1 knockdown resulted in reduced BCR/ABL protein
expression (Figure 1B), along with impaired clonogenic
potential (Figure 1C; K562, scramble 270.5±8.4 versus
siRNA 212.3±12.6, **p < 0.01; KU812, scramble
42.3±1.9 versus 23.0±1.1, ***p < 0.001) and the increased
activated form of caspases (Figure 1D). Similarly,
increased expression of miR-29b, a negative regulator
for Sp1 [18, 19], suppressed BCR/ABL expression with
a concurrent increase of the activated caspases (Figure
1E). The downregulation of DNMT3a was used as a
positive control [18]. To pharmacologically inhibit Sp1,
we employed BORT that was demonstrated to abolish
Sp1 transactivation in our previous studies [19, 20].
As shown in Figure 1F, exposure of K562 and KU812
cells to BORT resulted in inhibition of Sp1 and BCR/
ABL protein expression. We also observed that BORT
treatment decreased the autophosphorylation of BCR/
ABL and the phosphorylation of CRKL, a BCR/ABL
downstream effector. Functionally, treatment with BORT
significantly disrupted K562 cell colony formation (Figure
1G; 70.3±5.1, 51.8±4.3, 43.5±4.5, 33.3±6.5; **p < 0.01,

method was used to load BORT into liposomes. The lipid
composition was HSPC/Chol/PEG2000-DSPEat 65/30/5
(mol/mol), intraliposomal buffer was 300 mM meglumine
and 300 mM calcium acetate solution (pH 10). Tf-PEGDSPE was synthesized and incorporated into L-BORT
by post-insertion for synthesis of TfR-targeted liposomes.
The incorporation of Tf into the liposomes did not change
the particle size significantly (not shown). By separating
liposomal and free drug using a 10 mL Sepharose CL-4B
column, 97.3% or so entrapment efficiencies were achieved

Synthesis and validation of L-BORT and Tf-LBORT
Because of high plasma protein binding and rapid
clearance, the therapeutic index of BORT could be improved.
To enhance BORT delivery efficiency, we designed L-BORT

and the final BORT content was 0.65 mg/mL, which then
could be concentrated by a tangential flow diafiltration
method to a higher concentration (Figure 2A and 2B). The
colloidal stability of L-BORT was evaluated by monitoring
changes in its mean diameter over time. Both L-BORT and
Tf-L-BORT remained stable at both 4°C for at least 3 weeks.
No significant difference in colloidal stability was observed
between L-BORT and Tf-L-BORT. The drug content
variation of L-BORT during storage was also tracked and
it was found that there was no leakage of entrapped BORT
over 50 days of storage.
To further study the morphology of L-BORT before
Tf incorporation, L-BORT was first prepared in a controlled
environment vitrification system (CEVS) and followed by
Philips CM120 YEM microscope with Gatan 791 MultiScan
CCD camera for Cryo-TEM imaging. As shown in Figure
2C, this Cryo-TEM image revealed spherical particle
morphology with diameter around 100 nm, which verified
the data obtained by dynamic light scattering. The external
dark circle represents the lipid layer.

Cellular uptake of R18-labelled L-BORT was
evaluated in K562 cells which highly expressed TfR
(not shown). Under fluorescence microscopy, we found
that Tf-L-BORT was efficiently internalized by the
cells after 1-hour of incubation and the level of uptake
was much higher than that of L-BORT (Figure 2D and
2E). Co-incubation of cells with free Tf significantly
reduced cellular uptake of Tf-L-BORT, but did not
affect the cellular uptake of L-BORT, suggesting that the
enhancement of BORT cellular uptake via Tf-L was due
to the presence of Tf ligands on the liposome surface.
The TfR-mediated cellular uptake of BORT through TfL-BORT was quantified by flow cytometry. It was also
found that the cellular uptake of both L-BORT and TfL-BORT was concentration dependent (not shown).
Compared to L-BORT, the higher efficacy of BORT
delivery by TfR-targeted nanoparticles was verified by the
greater accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the
presence of Tf-L-BORT (Figure 2F).

Pharmacokinetics of L-BORT in vitro and in vivo
BORT exposure and elimination in mice were
investigated following a tail vein injection of L-BORT at
1.0 mg/kg dose. The PK of free BORT at the same dose
level was assessed in parallel as a comparison. The plasma
concentration-time plot (Figure 3A) showed that L-BORT
had a much higher drug exposure and slower elimination
rate than the free BORT. PK parameters were obtained by
Non-compartmental PK analysis in Phoenix WinNonlin. As
shown in Table 1, the blood circulation half-life of BORT
in the liposome formulation elongated from 12.4 hours to
23.5 hours when compared to the free BORT, resulting in the
high plasma exposure (AUC) of 6.56 μg·hr/mL, which was
about 10 fold of that of free BORT (0.469 μg·hr/mL). Also
the clearance was reduced from 1510 mL/hr/kg to 153 mL/
hr/kg, suggesting that using liposome as carriers for BORT
is potentially beneficial to therapeutic efficacy.

BORT in liposomes can decrease its side effects while
maintaining higher delivery efficiency, we incubated
the drug formulation with K562 cells for 48 hours and
then measured the cell survival rates by MTS assays. As
shown in Figure 3B and Table 2, L-BORT suppressed cell
proliferation with an IC50 of 814 nM (p < 0.05). Increased
cytotoxicity was induced by Tf-L-BORT (IC50 305 nM)
compared to that by L-BORT, which was probably caused
by the enhanced cellular uptake of the former.
To determine the toxicity in vivo, liposomal vehicle,
free or L-BORT was administrated through the tail vein
to normal BALB/cByJ mice (6-8 weeks old, 22 ± 5 g)
in a small volume (0.2 ml) at normal pressure. The dose
used was 2.5 mg/kg every four days. We observed that
50% of mice with free drug died in two weeks, but no
observable toxicity was observed in L-BORT-treated mice
(Figure 3C). These results indicate that formulated BORT
had much lower toxicity.

with various doses of L-BORT for 48 hours followed
by Western blot to assess BCR/ABL protein levels
and its activity. Similar to free BORT, L-BORT
significantly decreased the expression of BCR/ABL and
the phosphorylation of BCR/ABL and CRKL (Figure
4A). Mechanistic investigations showed that Sp1-DNA
complex in BCR/ABL promoter was disrupted upon
exposure to L-BORT (Figure 4B). The abolishment of
Sp1-DNA complex by hBCR1/hBCR2 probes without

P-label or with mutated Sp1-binding sites demonstrated
the Sp1 binding specificity in BCR/ABL promoter. Given
that L-BORT impaired Sp1 protein expression (Figure
4C), these results suggested that L-BORT-mediated
BCR/ABL dysfunction occurs through inhibition of Sp1associated transcription. Functionally, L-BORT treatment
in K562 and KU812 cells dose-dependently disrupted
their clonogenic ability (Figure 4D; K562, 151.0±11.8,

the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin, alone and in
combination with a subtoxic BORT formulation at 2
nM to doxorubicin resistant K562/DOX cells. Initially,
we determined the effects of drug treatment sequences
on chemosensitivities by treating the K562/DOX cells
with 100 nM doxorubicin for 24-hour before, after or
simultaneous addition of subtoxic 2 or 10 nM Tf-LBORTs followed by another 24 hour co-incubation.
Only with the treatment order of doxorubicin first and
then Tf-L-BORT, K562/DOX cells showed significant
sensitivity to doxorubicin with as low as 41.4% survival
rate at doxorubicin concentration of 100 nM (Figure
5A, #1). Meanwhile, the other two treatment methods
as well as 2 nM Tf-L-BORT did not induce significant
cell death (Figure 5A, #2 and #3). We then applied
this treatment strategy to K562/DOX cells exposed to
various concentrations of doxorubicin. As shown in
Figure 5B and Table 3, L-BORT enhanced the K562/
DOX sensitivity to doxorubicin with IC50 decreasing
from 8 μM to 300 nM, compared to free BORT (p
< 0.05). Tf-L-BORT further increased the K562/
DOX chemosensitivity to doxorubicin, shown by the
decreased IC50 to 90 nM compared to that in the absence
of L-BORT (p < 0.05). The survival rate of K562/DOX
cells after 15 μM doxorubicin treatment combined with
subtoxic Tf-L-BORT was 7 times lower than that with
same amount of L-BORT (p < 0.05). Therefore, Tf-LBORT was more effective in chemosensitization than
L-BORT.

L-BORT sensitizes single tumor cells to DOX
and synergizes with DOX to downregulate BCR/
ABL protein expression

with Tf-L-BORT induced the most suppressed expression
of BCR/ABL and Sp1 compared to other groups (Figure
5E, upper), which was confirmed in KU812 cells with
similar treatment (Figure 5E, lower). Importantly, in
comparing the exposure of K562 single tumor cell to
DOX alone or plus BORT formulations, the combined TfL-BORT and DOX resulted in the most downregulation of
BCR/ABL and Sp1 (Figure 5F). These results support the
idea that L-BORT sensitizes CML cells to DOX through
more pronounced inhibition of Sp1-BCR/ABL axis.

To investigate how L-BORT influences tumor cell
growth, tumors were harvested from K562 tumor bearing
mice and separated into single cells by collagenase.
The single tumor cells were then cultured in RPMI1640
medium with 10% FBS and the cell survival was then
evaluated in the presence of doxorubicin combined with
subtoxic BORT. As shown in Figure 5C and Table 4, a
synergistic effect of toxicity to single tumor cells was
found between DOX and free BORT, consistent with what
we have observed in K562 cells. IC50 of DOX to single
tumor cells decreased from 17 μM to 2.3 μM with help
of free BORT. L-BORT, with enhanced BORT delivery,
amplified the synergy effect to approximately a 70-fold
increase in chemosensitivity (p < 0.05). Tf-L-BORT was
more effective in chemosensitizing tumor single cells than
L-BORT, with decreased IC50 of doxorubicin at 104 nM.
Having demonstrated that L-BORT and DOX
synergistically inhibited CML cell proliferation, next we
sought to determine the underlying mechanisms. Initially,
K562 cells were treated with different doses of DOX. We
found that doxorubicin dose-dependently downregulated
BCR/ABL expression at 48 hours (Figure 5D). Based on
this finding, we employed 200 nM DOX and treated K562
cells with DOX alone or in the combination with different
BORT formulations. As expected, combination of DOX

DISCUSSION
It is well known that BCR/ABL expression levels
play a critical role in its kinase activity, CML disease
progression, drug resistance and the development of
point mutations [9, 12, 21, 22]]. However, it remains
largely unknown how the BCR/ABL gene is regulated.
While inhibitors targeting BCR/ABL kinase activity
have been broadly utilized in clinical trials with great
success, the outcomes are not yet optimal. In this study,
we demonstrated that Sp1 is a positive regulator of the
BCR/ABL gene, shedding light on how BCR/ABL is
overexpressed in CML. We present evidence that Sp1
dysfunction leads to the blockage of BCR/ABL signaling
and CML cell proliferation, thus identifying the Sp1-BCR/
ABL axis as a promising target for overcoming aberrant
BCR/ABL activity. We showed that L-BORT has better
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with less

cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, opening a therapeutic
window for the application of Sp1 inhibitors, including
BORT, in CML subpopulations characterized by BCR/
ABL overexpression.
Sp1 is a zinc finger transcriptional factor.
Our previous investigations demonstrated that Sp1
is significantly involved in the regulation of DNA
methyltransferases [18, 20], RTKs (KIT, FLT3) [19,
23] and miR-29b [19]. We showed that Sp1 specifically
binds to the BCR/ABL gene promoter, and genetic and
pharmacologic inactivation of Sp1 disrupted BCR/ABL
protein expression and phosphorylation. These findings
unveil BCR/ABL as an innovative member of Sp1 targeted
family. Given the crucial role of Sp1 in BCR/ABL kinase
activity, we employed BORT, a well-established Sp1
inhibitor [19, 20], and found that exposure of CML cells to
BORT resulted in impairment of the Sp1-BCR/ABL axis
and subsequent suppression of CML cell proliferation.
These results identified the Sp1-BCR/ABL axis as a new
molecular regulator underlying the anti-cancer actions
of BORT and are in line with our previous discoveries
in AML [19, 20, 24] showing that BORT treatment
disrupts Sp1-dependent KIT/FLT3 kinase signaling, DNA
hypermethylation and restores miR-29b expression. Given
that BORT was also found to increase TSG expression that
is silenced by BCR/ABL-promoted proteasome-dependent
degradation [14], further investigations are necessary to
clarify the role of BORT in controlling CML growth.
Although ours and other studies show that BORT
efficiently inhibits survival and induces apoptosis in BCR/
ABL cells, a pilot study [15] reported minimal efficacy
and considerable toxicity in CML patients receiving BORT
therapy. While it remains to be further elucidated, such
disappointing outcomes may result from the inefficiency
and non-specificity of BORT delivery in vivo. Therefore,
we developed a liposomal formulation of BORT with
the objective to lower non-specific toxicity while
maintain high efficacy to sensitize cancer cells to typical
chemotherapy drugs, like DOX. In addition, liposomes
with targeting ligands, such as antibodies, growth factors,
Tf and vitamin folate, can decrease the serum aggregation
and improve the specific drug delivery to diseased cells
for different reasons. Besides the shielding effect and
specificity, liposomes containing multiple targeting
ligands have multivalent binding to specific cell surfaces
and therefore can deliver a larger payload of drugs than
liposomes without targeting ligands. Correspondingly,
more and more receptor overexpression has been found
in tumors and other disease tissues. For example, the
folate receptor (FR) is found to be up-regulated in more
than 90% of non-mucinous ovarian carcinomas while
its expression in normal tissues is highly restricted.
Additionally, the amplification of human epidermal
growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) gene has been observed
in breast cancer and ovarian cancers. The liposomes with
targeting ligands to these receptors have been identified
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to be efficient and specific to deliver drugs in vitro. In
the current study, Tf-attached liposomes (Tf-L) were
formulated for the enhanced BORT delivery to K562 cells.
The establishment of the L-BORT preparation
procedure was based on the optimization of a remote
drug loading method and intraliposomal buffer system,
for the objective of high drug entrapment efficiency.
When intraliposomal buffer of meglumine and calcium
acetate solution was replaced by a sorbitol solution (pH
8), neither remote loading method nor passive entrapment
method could bring drug entrapment efficiency to higher
than 15%. By comparing various methods, it was found
that our method herein had the highest drug entrapment
(97.3%) and appropriate particle size (~100 nm) for
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. It was
therefore finally adopted for the following in vitro efficacy
and in vivo PK studies.
The cellular uptake experiments showed that TfRadjusted BORT uptake was much higher than that by nontargeted delivery and the subtoxic Tf-L-BORT treated
K562/DOX also obtained the enhanced chemosensitivity
to anticancer drug, DOX, indicating the improved but
consistent efficacy compared to free BORT. Although
there is high concentration of free Tfs existing in
circulation, we do not think they can compete with Tf-LBORT to bind TfR on cell surface, because most of them
are not iron-loaded and, therefore, have lower affinity for
the TfR than the holo-Tf used in the Tf-L-BORT. In fact,
gallium citrate, a clinical radiopharmaceutical, acts by in
vivo loading on to circulating Tf and is able to effectively
target tumors in patients despite the presence of an
abundance of the unloaded Tf in circulation. In addition,
Tf-L-BORT contains multiple Tfs on each particle and is
capable of multivalent interaction with the target cells.
Such interaction is likely to result in a great increase in
affinity compared to the Tf found in circulation, which is
monovalent. Therefore, the Tf-L-BORT should be able to
out-compete endogenous Tf found in circulation for TfR
binding.
L-BORT had less toxicity than free BORT with
approximately 20-time and 10-time increases of IC50 from
39 nM to 814 nM and 305 nM, respectively, for L-BORT
and Tf-L-BORT, which could probably be explained by
the hypothesis of slow release of L-BORT following the
cellular uptake via endocytosis. These results identified
the advantage of liposome, especially Tf-liposome, as
drug delivery system to efficiently and specifically deliver
BORT to targets and could be helpful to decrease the
side effects for treating leukemia patients. Pretreatment
of K562/DOX cells with subtoxic Tf-L-BORT reversed
the drug resistance to DOX. Pharmacokinetic study
demonstrated that L-BORT had prolonged a blood
circulation time and decreased clearance compared to
the free drug. Consistent with this are the findings that,
as compared to free BORT, L-BORT provides longterm disease free survival in mice bearing large granular

[25]. Thus, switching to a liposomal formulation will offer
the potential to alter the pharmacokinetics and provide
a more favorable efficacy/toxicity profile for BORT in
human trials.

ligand was incorporated into BORT-loaded liposomes
by a post-insertion method and the resulting L-BORT
and Tf-L-BORT were sterilized by filtration through a
0.22 μm membrane filter. Liposome size distribution was
determined by dynamic light scattering on a NICOMP
Submicron Particle Sizer Model 370 (NICOMP,
Santa Barbara, CA). To determine the drug content,
the liposomes were lysed by methanol and the BORT
concentration in the lysate was determined by absorption
at 271 nm on a Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometer.
Loading efficiency of BORT in liposomes was calculated
based on the ratio of the amount of free and liposomal
drugs, which were separated by the Sepharose CL-4B
column.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and compounds
Cell lines (K562 and KU812) were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).
BORT was obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA).
On-targetplus Smart pool SiRNA for Sp1 gene, miR-29b
and their corresponding scrambles were purchased from
Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).

Measurement of cellular uptake and evaluation
of cytotoxicity

Transient transfection and western blot

Cellular uptake of R18-labeled Tf-L-BORT or
L-BORT was evaluated in K562 cells. About 4×105 cells
were incubated with liposomes at 37°C. After 1-hour of
incubation, the cells were then washed three times with
PBS, photographed on a Nikon fluorescence microscope
(Nikon, Küsnacht, Switzerland) and measured by a FACS
Calibur flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ). To evaluate BORT toxicity, K562 cells were
treated by different concentration of free- or L-BORT.
Regarding to the chemosensitivity to doxorubicin, the
K562/ DOX cells were pre-treated with doxorubicin for 24
hours and then subtoxic BORT formulations were added
for additional 24 hours. Cellular viability was assessed by
MTT proliferation assays (Promega, Madison, WI).

Sp1 siRNA, miR-29b and their scrambles were
introduced into K562 cells by Lipofectamine™ 2000
(Invitrogen) and the Western blotting was performed as
previously described [20, 26, 27]. The antibodies used
are: Sp1, DNMT3a, β-actin and ubiquitin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); ABL, phospho-ABL,
caspase-3 and caspase-8 (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA); Parp, CRKL and p-CRKL (Millipore,
Billerica, MA).

Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSA)
EMSA with nuclear extracts and 32p-labeled probes
were performed as previously described [19, 20]. The
sequences of the oligoes for BCR/ABL promoter probes
are listed in supplementary material.

Pharmacokinetics of L-BORT
BORT (1.0 mg/kg) was injected into ICR mice via
the tail vein and blood samples were collected at various
time points. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation at
1500×g for 10 minutes and stored at -20°C. Concentration
of BORT in the plasma was calculated from boron
concentration the sample, which was measured by coupled
plasma-optical emission spectrometers (ICP-OES).
For ICP-OES measurement, the plasma samples were
prepared as previously described [28]. Data analysis and
PK parameter calculations were carried out in Phoenix®
WinNonlin® 6.3 (Certara, Princeton, NJ).

Clonogenic assays
Methylcellulose colony-forming assays were carried
out in MethoCult® mixture (Stem Cell Technologies Inc.,
Vancouver, Canada) as previously described [26, 27].
Briefly, six hours after transfection or exposure to drugs,
the cells were harvested and diluted with IMDM + 2%
FBS. About 1,000 cells were distributed into 6-well plate.
The colonies were scored in 7-10 days.

Preparation and characterization of L-BORT
and Tf-L-BORT

Preparation of single tumor cells

The synthesis of L-BORT was done as previously
described [25]. Briefly, a remote loading method was used
to prepare L-BORT. Liposomes were initially synthesized
encapsulating a “drug-trapping” solution of meglumine
and calcium acetate. External buffer was removed and
BORT was then added to initiate drug loading. Finally,
unencapsulated BORT was removed by gel filtration. Tf

K562 cells (10×106) were subcutaneously injected
into the flank of 4-6 week old NOD/SCID mice (The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). When the tumor
size approached 1000 mm3, the tumors were harvested
from mouse flank and cut into pieces in PBS buffer.
Collagenase was added into the above buffer and
incubated for 2 hours at 37°C with shaking. The digested

tumor cell suspension was filtered through a cell strainer
and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes. The separated
tumor cells were kept in cell frozen medium and stored
in liquid N2 until use. All animal studies were performed
in accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal
care and under the protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee University of Minnesota.
