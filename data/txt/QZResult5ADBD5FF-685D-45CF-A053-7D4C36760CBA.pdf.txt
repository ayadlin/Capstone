ABSTRACT
We have previously screened thirteen medicinal mushrooms for their potential
anti-cancer activities in eleven different cell lines and found that the extract of
Amauroderma rude exerted the highest capacity in inducing cancer cell death. The
current study aimed to purify molecules mediating the anti-cancer cell activity. The
extract of Amauroderma rude was subject to fractionation, silica gel chromatography,
and HPLC. We purified a compound and identified it as ergosterol by EI-MS and NMR,
which was expressed at the highest level in Amauroderma rude compared with other
medicinal mushrooms tested. We found that ergosterol induced cancer cell death,
which was time and concentration dependent. In the in vivo experiment, normal mice
were injected with murine cancer cell line B16 that is very aggressive and caused
mouse death severely. We found that treatment with ergosterol prolonged mouse
survival. We found that ergosterol-mediated suppression of breast cancer cell viability
occurred through apoptosis and that ergosterol up-regulated expression of the tumor
suppressor Foxo3. In addition, the Foxo3 down-stream signaling molecules Fas, FasL,
BimL, and BimS were up-regulated leading to apoptosis in human breast cancer cells
MDA-MB-231. Our results suggest that ergosterol is the main anti-cancer ingredient
in Amauroderma rude, which activated the apoptotic signal pathway. Ergosterol may
serve as a potential lead for cancer therapy.

Ganodermataceae is a well-known family of
medicinal mushrooms, which contains 11 genus including
Ganoderma and Amauroderma. Ganoderma lucidum,
a traditional Chinese medicinal fungus used for over
2000 years, is the most known medicinal mushroom in
Ganoderma and is regarded as folk medicine used for
prevention and treatment of various human diseases,
including cancer [8–13]. The genus Amauroderma
contains approximately 30 species and most of the species
are widespread in tropical areas [14]. Amauroderma rude

INTRODUCTION
Drug discovery and development for therapeutics of
various diseases including cancer are still reliant on natural
ingredients. In cancer treatment, many drugs have natural
origins or are obtained directly from natural sources [1–3].
Microorganisms have been continuous sources for drug
development as some bioactive molecules can be easily
obtained from these species. Medicinal mushrooms, used
in oriental traditional therapies, contain many functional
compounds to inhibit tumor growth [4–7].

species in this genus have been newly recognized as
medicinal fungus [15–17]. Techniques have been developed
to cultivate Amauroderma rude making it possible to obtain
large quantity of Amauroderma rude [16].
Over the past decades, it has been demonstrated
that many fungus compounds exert anti-cancer activity
by boosting immunity or directly inducing cancer
cell death [18–20]. The main bioactive compounds
are polysaccharides, terpenoids, and sterols [21–23].
Polysaccharides, which have been isolated from
Ganoderma lucidum, Cordyceps sinensis, Lentinula
edodes, Coriolus versicolor, Grifola frondosa,
Schizophyllum commune, possess anti-cancer activity
mainly through activating the immune system and
facilitating the immune cells to attack cancer cells
[24–27]. Lentinan from Lentinula edodes, Polysaccharide
Krestin (PSK) and Polysaccharide Peptide (PSP) from
Coriolus versicolor have been used in clinics for several
decades [22, 28]. We have previously reported that the
water extract of Amauroderma rude inhibited cancer
cell survival and induced cell apoptosis [16]. Since
polysaccharides may be the major components in the
water extract that possess anti-cancer activity, small
molecules such as terpenoids and sterols may stay in
the lipid fraction. In this study, we aim to identify small
molecules in the lipid fraction of Amauroderma rude with
anti-cancer activity.

(AReth) and the chloroform fraction (ARchl) were
found to possess a potent effect on inducing cancer cell
death (Fig. 2). As shown in the figure, AReth induced
death of MDA-MB-231 in a concentration-dependent
manner. Similar inhibitory effects were observed in
MDA-MB-468, SK-BR-3, MCF-7, and 4T1 cells. The
chloroform fraction (ARchl), which was purified from
ethanol extract, displayed significantly stronger inhibitory
effects on the five breast cancer cell lines than AReth at
the same concentrations (Fig. 2).
The fraction was then used to purify further with
the silica gel column chromatography. It was dissolved in
100 ml petroleum ether and mixed with 40 g dry silica gel
(160–200 mesh). The mixture was evaporated to remove
petroleum ether at 60oC. Meanwhile, silica gel (500 g)
was packed into a glass column (15 × 100 cm, DxH). The
evaporated ARchl-gel mixture was applied onto the top
of the bed of the silica gel column, followed by elution
with different mixture of eluent. The solvent system was
either the mixture of petroleum ether and acetone (P/A)
at the ratios of 96:4, 94:6, 93:7, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, and 5:5, or
100% methanol, 250 ml each. A total of 891 fractions
were collected. Each collection was evaporated by a rotary
evaporator (Type RE3000, Shanghai Yarong Biochemistry
Instrument Factory).
Each collection was analyzed by Thin Layer
Chromatography (TLC). The collections showing
similar bands were combined. A total of 13 combinations
were reached. The anti-cancer cell activity of these
combinations was tested using human breast cancer
cells MT-1 and human astrocytoma cell line U87. Six
combinations displayed anti-cancer activity, including
TL61–69, TL110–143, TL416–451, TL452–521, TL526–
535, TL536–549, in which TL61–69 showed the highest
activity. The combination TL61–69 was further purified
by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatograph
(RP-HPLC) (Agilent HPLC1200, USA). The column was
eluted by methanol-water (at the ratio of 95:5), at the
speed 4 ml/min. A fraction ARHPLC-1 was obtained,
which was a white crystal with needle-like shape.

RESULTS
Ethanol extract and chloroform fraction of
Amauroderma rude induced cancer cell death
We have previously reported that the water extract of
Amauroderma rude inhibited growth of cancer cells [16].
In this study, we aimed to identify the anti-cancer
compound by a number of purification approaches. The
anti-cancer activity of each component was monitored by
incubating with cancer cell cultures. Using this approach,
we found that the ethanol extract (AReth) was very potent
in inducing cancer cell death. The ethanol extract was then
fractionated by petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate,
water-saturated butanol, and water alone. After evaporation
of the collection, petroleum ether fraction (PEF),
chloroform fraction (ARchl), ethyl acetate fraction (EAF),
water-saturated butanol fraction (BF), and water fraction
(WF) were obtained (Fig. 1). We found that the chloroform
fraction (ARchl) displayed the highest activity in inducing
cancer cell death. A total of 20 grams was obtained.
We tested the effects of the ethanol extract (AReth)
and the chloroform fraction (ARchl) on human breast
carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468,
SK-BR-3, and MCF-7, and mouse breast cancer cell
line 4T1. A normal mouse embryo fibroblast cell line
NIH3T3 was used as a control. The ethanol extract

Structural analysis of compound ARHPLC-1
After a series of separation and purification
procedures of the silica gel column chromatography
and HPLC, compound ARHPLC-1 was obtained. The
structure and composition of this compound was analyzed
by EI-MS and 13C and 1H NMR. The molecular formula
of ARHPLC-1 was determined as C28H44O by analysis
of its EI-MS (m/z 396(M+) (Fig. 3A) and 13C and 1H
NMR data (Table 1). These data were consistent with
previously reported data on ergosta-5, 7, 22-trien-3βol (ergosterol)  [29]. Thus, ARHPLC-1 was identified as
ergosta-5, 7, 22-trien-3β-ol (ergosterol), and its structure is
shown in - Fig. 3B.

In addition, we quantified the contents of ergosterol
in various medicinal fungi, including Ganoderma sinense,
Ganoderma lucidum, Amauroderma rude, Coriolus
versicolor, Ganoderma tsugae by HPLC. The ergosterol
content of Amauroderma rude was the highest among
these popular medicinal mushrooms with a concentration
of 2.58 mg/g (Fig. 3C).

anti-cancer effects [30]. We compared the effects of AReth,
ARchl, and the purified ergosterol on cancer cell migration.
In the Boyden chamber migration assay, we found that at the
concentration of 75 μg/ml, both AReth and ARchl displayed
an inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-231 cell migration,
whereas the purified ergosterol exerted a significant
inhibitory effect on cancer cell migration at the concentration
of 10 μg/ml (Fig. 4A). In Matrigel invasion assay, we found
that AReth and ARchl displayed inhibitory effect on MDAMB-231 cell invasion at the concentration 50 μg/ml, whereas
ergosterol exerted a significant inhibitory effect on cancer
cell invasion at the concentration of 20 μg/ml (Fig. 4B).
We further tested that role of the purified ergosterol

cell lines and found that survival rates of all cancer
cell lines, including MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468,
SK-BR-3, MCF-7, and 4T1, were decreased when they
were treated with 50–100 μM (20–40 μg/ml) ergosterol
(Fig. 5A). However, at these concentrations, the purified
ergosterol had little effect on NIH3T3 fibroblasts. In
fact, the purified ergosterol displayed a significant effect
on MDA-MB-231 cell survival at the concentration of
125 μM when the cells were treated for 24 hours, and at
the concentration of 63 μM when the cells were treated for
48 hours (Fig. 5B).
We further tested the effect of the purified
ergosterol on colony formation of MDA-MB-231
cells. The experiment showed that at the concentration

of 75 μM, ergosterol inhibited colony formation in
both the sizes and number of the colonies (Fig. 5C).
We determined whether the ergosterol-induced
cancer cell death occurred through apoptosis. At the
concentration of 63 μM, ergosterol induced cancer cell
apoptosis significantly (Fig. 5D). Some necrosis was
also detected but not significantly.
Since synthetic ergosterol is available commercially,
we tested the effect of the commercially available
ergosterol on cancer cell survival. It was found that the
synthetic ergosterol induced cell death more potent than

some impurity in the product which was of cytotoxicity,
we tested the effect of the product on the non-cancer cell

death was detected when the cells were treated with 50 μM
of synthetic ergosterol (Fig. 5F). We briefly purified the
ergosterol by recrystallization using ethanol precipitation
method. The purified synthetic ergosterol was then
tested on MDA-MB-231 cells and had a similar effect on
MDA-MB-231 cells as the naturally purified ergosterol
(Fig. 5E).

Foxo3 plays pivotal roles in tumorigenesis and drug
resistance [32–34]. Foxo3 deregulation is essential in the
development of cancer [35].
We examined the effect of ergosterol on Foxo3
expression by real-time PCR using total RNAs isolated
from MDA-MB-231 cells treated with or without
ergosterol using the primers listed (Table 2). We found that
Foxo3 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated as
compared with the control (Fig. 7A). Western bolt analysis
revealed that Foxo3 protein also increased in the cells
treated with ergosterol (Fig. 7B).
Foxo3 has been shown to activate pro-apoptotic
genes such as FasL, Bad, Bim, Trail [36–38]. Bim is a
Foxo3 target gene and is one of the BH3-only protein, and

its upregulation induces cell apoptosis [36, 37]. There are
three major isoforms of Bim including BimEL, BimL, and
BimS as a result of alternative splicing [39]. We found
that ergosterol treatment increased the levels of Bim L
and Bim S in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7B).
Fas L (Fas ligand) is a ligand of a death receptor
on the cell surface, linking with its receptor Fas triggers
the cell extrinsic apoptotic pathway. It has been reported
that Foxo3 increased expression of Fas L and concurrent
expression of Fas to induce cell apoptosis in response to
environmental stressor [40]. We measured mRNA levels
of Fas and Fas L in the cells treated with or without
ergosterol and found that the treated cells showed
increased expression of the mRNA levels of Fas and

DISCUSSION

Ergosterol had long been recognized as an important
bioactive compound isolated from other sources including
medical fungi [41–45]. Yazawa and co-workers showed
that ergosterol, isolated from Polyporus, provides
significant protection against the promotion of bladder
tumor on rats which have been induced by many types
of promoters in the environment [46]. Takaku et al.
reported that ergosterol isolated from Agaricus blazei
directly inhibited angiogenesis induced by solid tumors,
using neovascularization model induced by Lewis lung
carcinoma cell-packed chambers and Matrigel [47].
Zhang et al. reported that ergosterol isolated from
Agrocybe aegerita showed inhibitory activity towards
the COX-II enzyme to reduce inflammation and promote
cancer prevention [48]. In our study, we adapted a mouse
model to investigate the effect of ergosterol on the survival
of mice bearing aggressive cancer cells B16 which causes
animal death. Our results showed that ergosterol prolonged
survival rates of tumor-bearing animals. This may be of
clinical significance.
Furthermore, we explored the molecular
mechanism underlying this effect. Our data showed
that Foxo3 was up-regulated after ergosterol treatment
in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) when the
cells  underwent apoptosis. It has been identified that
the o
­ ver-expression of Foxo3 inhibited tumor growth
in vitro and tumor development in vivo in many
cancer [49, 50]. Therapy-resistant acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) cells were shown to inactivate Foxo3
activity to escape apoptosis induction [51]. Foxo3
can induce cell apoptosis by directly activating the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway through u
­ p-regulation of
death receptor ligand Fas L and the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic BH-3 only
Bim [52]. Our results showed that Bim and Fas L were
indeed up-regulated after ergosterol treatment at the
transcription and translation levels. These data provided
evidence that Foxo3 directly activates its target genes
Bim and Fas L to triggered cancer cell apoptosis via
the mitochondria-dependent intrinsic pathway and the
death receptor ligand-dependent extrinsic pathway, after
ergosterol treatment.
In summary, we investigated the anti-cancer activity
of Amauroderma rude. Small molecules of anti-cancer
activity were obtained in the ethanol extract, which were
then detected in the chloroform fraction. Ergosterol,
which is the major active component, was purified by gel
silica, chromatography, HPLC purification. We further
showed that ergosterol prolonged animal survival by upregulating Foxo3 and Foxo3 downstream molecules Bim,
Fas, and Fas L. These results provide new insight for
future development of Amauroderma rude as an effective
and safe medical mushroom for use by cancer patients. It
also provides evidence allowing us to further understand
the molecular mechanism by which ergosterol exerts its

We previously compared the anti-cancer effect of
13 different medicinal mushrooms and reported that the
water extract of Amauroderma rude possesses the most
effective capacity in inducing cancer cell death [16]. It
has been thought that mushroom polysaccharides are the
major component in the anti-cancer activities through
activation of the immune response of the host organism.
We quantitated the ploysaccharides contents of the
13 medicinal mushrooms and found that the amount of
ploysaccharides did not match the anti-cancer effect of the
mushrooms [16]. We reasoned that some small molecules
might play key role in inducing cancer cell death.
In this study, we extracted small molecules from
Amauroderma rude with ethanol. After a series of
fractionation, chromatography, and HPLC purification,
we identified ergosterol as the anti-cancer molecule. In
the purification process, the sensitivity of the system to
screen for anti-cancer ingredients is critical. The important
factors for effective identification of the compounds are
the time lines and the amounts of anti-cancer ingredients
used. The assay should be sensitive with only a small
amount of the ingredients and the results can be obtained
within 1–2 days. In the initial screening, we found that the
ethanol extract exerted a strong effect on inducing cancer
cell death. This result suggests that small molecules, which
were extracted by ethanol, indeed possessed potent effects
on inducing cancer cell death. With a number of cancer
cell lines to test the effects of the anti-cancer compounds,
which were developed by us previously [16], we were able
to identify ergosterol as the major molecule in inducing
cancer cell death.
It should be mentioned that there were other
ingredients and molecules that possessed anti-cancer
activity. For example, when we fractionated the ethanol
extract, we could only use the fraction with the highest
anti-cancer activity for further purification. This relied
on the total anti-cancer activity of each fraction, rather
than the anti-cancer activity of a single molecule. It is
possible that one fraction might contain some molecules
with very high anti-cancer activity, but still not be selected
because this fraction contained fewer such molecules of
anticancer activity. When we combined the 891 fractions
into 13 combinations based on their migration patterns
in Thin Layer Chromatography, we could only use two
cell lines, MT1 and U87, which have been found to be
highly sensitive to anti-cancer ingredients [16] to save
samples. There could be other cancer cell lines that
are more sensitive to some other ingredients. In the
13 combinations, we found at least 6 of them possessed
anti-cancer activity, but we could only identify the one
with the highest activity. Other combinations could
contain novel molecules with potent anti-cancer activity.
This awaits further investigation.

anti-cancer activity. Future work could lead to synthesis
and modification of ergosterol structure to improve its
effective therapy in clinical settings.

The invasion assay was performed as described
[53]. In brief, the transwell inserts were loaded with
80 μl of Matrigel (1:8 dilution) and incubated at 37°C for

placed onto the wells of a 24-well plate, to which 500 μl

gel bed, followed by incubation at 37°C for 36 hours. The
transwell inserts were fixed with cool methanol for 15 min
and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The upper
Matrigel layer and cells were removed. Cells that invaded
through the Matrigel and spread onto the lower surface of
the inserts were photographed under a light microscope
and counted from representative fields for quantification.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Extraction, isolation and purification of
anti-cancer compounds
The dry fruit bodies of Amauroderma rude (10 kg)
were pulverized to powder. The powder was soaked in
95% ethanol at a ratio of 1:15 (w/v), and extracted by
refluxing three times at 80°C, 2 hours each. The extracted
solution was filtered and concentrated under a vacuum to
remove the solvents. A yield of 520 g was obtained.
The ethanol extract was subject to fractionation
and purification using different polarity solvent and
silica gel column chromatography. In brief, the ethanol
fraction was dispersed in distilled water. The resulting
suspension was fractionated by petroleum ether,
chloroform, ethyl acetate, and water-saturated butanol
in turn. Each fraction was collected and evaporated.
The anti-tumor activity of all fractions was tested
with human breast cancer cell line MT1 and human
astrocytoma cells U87 cells. The bioactive components
were subject to further purification. This included silica
gel chromatography, Thin Layer Chromatography
(TLC), and reversed-phase high performance liquid
chromatograph (RP-HPLC). The detailed steps are
provided in the results section.

Viability and cell death assay
Human breast carcinoma cell lines (MB231,
MB468, SK-BR-3, and MCF-7), and mouse breast cancer
cell line 4T1 were used to test the effects of each sample in
inducing tumor cell death. In brief, cells (1 × 105 cells/ml)
were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates in DMEM/
RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100U/ml
penicillin/ streptomycin at 37°C, 5% CO2. Four hours after
cell inoculation, the ethanol extract (AReth), chloroform
fraction (ARchl) and a pure compound (ARHPLC-1
or ergosterol) were added to the cultures at different
concentrations and incubated for 48 hours. Cell viability
was analyzed by trypan blue staining.

MS and NMR analysis
For MS identification, the compound ARHPLC-1
was dissolved in methanol and recorded on EI-mass
spectrometer (DSQ II, Thermo, USA). For NMR
measurements, ARHPLC-1 was dissolved with CDCL3.
The NMR spectra were recorded on BRUKER AVANCE
IIIT 400HD (Bruker BioSpin, Switzerland).

Colony growth assay
Colony growth assay was performed using previously
described method [54, 55]. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells
(500 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured
in 0.25% low melting agarose gel containing ergosterol.
Two weeks after cell growth, colonies were counted, fixed,
stained, and photographed under a microscope.

Cell migration
The Boyden transwell inserts were placed onto each
well of the 24-well tissue culture plates, to which 500 μl
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) had
been added. MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 104 cells in 100 μl
serum-free medium containing different concentrations
of AReth, ARchl, or ergosterol) were loaded into each
transwell, followed by incubation at 37°C for 6 hours.
The cells in the transwell inserts were fixed with cool
methanol for 15 min and stained with Coomassie Brilliant
Blue. Cells that stayed on the upper surface of the inserts
were removed. Cells that migrated through the transwells
and spread onto the lower surface of the transwells were
photographed under a light microscope and counted from
representative areas for quantification.

Flow cytometry
Cell apoptosis was analyzed by Annexin V
apoptosis detection kit APC (eBioscience, Inc., USA)
as described [56, 57]. In brief, MDA-MB-231 cells
were treated with ARHPLC-1 (ergosterol) at different
concentrations. Six hours after cell incubation, the cells
were washed, trypsinized, collected, and resuspended
in 100 μl binding buffer, followed by incubation with
Annexin V (APC) in the dark at room temperature for
15 minutes. The cells were then washed, resuspended in
400 μl binding buffer, to which 5 μl of Propidium Iodide
staining solution were added. The cells were analyzed

Statistical analysis

by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, Becton, Dickinson
and Company. USA). The cells showing Annexin
V-positive and PI-negative were counted as apoptotic,
whereas PI-positive staining was counted as necrotic cells.

The results of all the experiments were subject to
statistical analysis by t-test. The level of significance was
set at p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 respectively. Animal survival
was analyzed using the Kaplan Meier survival curves with
log-rank analysis.

Western blotting
After being treated with the purified compound of
Amauroderma rude, cells were lysed by the lysis buffer
containing protease inhibitor (CALBIOCHEM, USA) on
ice for 30 min and centrifuged to obtain clear cell lysates.
Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad Dc
protein assay. Samples with equal contents of proteins
were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
NC membranes (Perkin Elmer, USA). After blocking with
5% milk, the membranes were incubated with primary
antibodies at 4°C overnight. Next day, the membranes
were washed three times, incubated with secondary
antibodies for 2 hours, and washed three times again. The
membranes were developed with the ECL kit (Millipore,
USA) and visualized using the Kodak Image Station
4000R.
