Abstract
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential
physiologic process that promotes cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Several lines of evidence from both
cellular and genetic studies suggest that AKT1/PKBa, but not
AKT2 or AKT3, serves as a negative regulator of EMT and breast
cancer metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism by
which AKT1 suppresses EMT remains poorly deﬁned. Here, we
demonstrate that phosphorylation of Twist1 by AKT1 is
required for b-TrCP–mediated Twist1 ubiquitination and degradation. The clinically used AKT inhibitor MK-2206, which

possesses higher speciﬁcity toward AKT1, stabilized Twist1 and
enhanced EMT in breast cancer cells. However, we discovered
that resveratrol, a naturally occurring compound, induced
b-TrCP–mediated Twist1 degradation to attenuate MK-2206–
induced EMT in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our ﬁndings
demonstrate that resveratrol counteracts the unexpected metastatic potential induced by anti-AKT therapy and therefore
suggest that the addition of resveratrol to an anti-AKT therapeutic regimen may provide extra support for limiting EMT.

Introduction

AKT2 or AKT3 serves as a negative regulator of epithelial-tomesenchyme transition (EMT) and breast cancer metastasis. For
instance, overexpression of AKT1 in breast cancer cells blocks cell
motility and invasion (4, 5), whereas downregulation of AKT1 in
MCF 10A cells decreases miR-200 abundance, thereby promoting
TGFb-induced EMT and stem cell–like phenotype (6). In AKT1/
and ErbB2 transgenic mice, AKT1 activation accelerates mammary
tumorigenesis but inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis (7).
Moreover, Irie and colleagues demonstrated that knockdown of
AKT1, but not AKT2, promotes insulin-like growth factor-1
(IGF1)-stimulated EMT and cell migration (4).
EMT is a complex reprogramming process of epithelial cells that
plays an indispensable role in tumor invasion and metastasis, and
characterized by well-deﬁned features such as the loss of epithelial
markers (E-cadherin and a- and g-catenin), the gain of mesenchymal cell markers (ﬁbronectin, vimentin, and N-cadherin), and
the acquisition of migratory and invasive properties (8, 9). To
date, several transcriptional repressors, for example, Zeb-1/2,
Twist1, and Snail-1/2, have been reported to regulate EMT. Twist1,
a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional
repressor, induces EMT to promote breast tumor metastasis (10)
and is transcriptionally regulated by EGFR/STAT3 (11, 12) and
NFkB signaling (13). However, the regulatory mechanisms via
posttranslational modiﬁcation of Twist1 remain less understood.
To better understand AKT1-mediated EMT repression, we crossanalyzed gene expression proﬁle of AKT isoforms using several
public datasets. We found that low expression of AKT1 was highly
associated with aggressive breast cancers and poor disease outcome. Moreover, our results indicated that AKT1 interacts with

The highly conserved AKT1/PKBa, AKT2/PKBb, and AKT3/
PKBg of the AKT/PKB protein kinase family are known to promote
tumor initiation and progression and are considered excellent
targets for anticancer therapy (1–3). However, the oncogenic
activities of the AKT isoforms are far more complex as exempliﬁed
by several lines of evidence demonstrating that AKT1 but not

and phosphorylates Twist1 at S42, T121, and S123 to induce
b-TrCP-mediated Twist1 degradation, leading to inhibition of
EMT. Importantly, chronic exposure of breast cancer cells to AKT
inhibitor, MK-2206, stabilizes Twist1 and induces EMT, whereas
administration of a b-TrCP inducer, resveratrol, degrades Twist1
and attenuates their metastatic potential. Together, our ﬁndings
offer new insights into the role of AKT1 in EMT inhibition and also
identify a potential for adverse effect of inducing EMT when antiAKT inhibitor is used in breast cancer treatment.

Materials and Methods
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
Western blot analysis using total lysates or immunoprecipitates
was performed as described previously (14) using the antibodies
listed in Supplementary Table S2.
Gene expression analysis
The following databases were used to compare AKT isoform
mRNA expression in breast cancer cells: Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE; ref. 15), Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)
dataset (16), and the University of North Carolina (UNC) cohort
(17, 18).
Cell lines and cell culture
All cell lines were obtained from the ATCC, independently
validated by STR DNA ﬁngerprinting at MD Anderson Cancer
Center (Houston, TX), and maintained in DMEM/F-12 with 10%
FBS. Stable cell lines were grown in the presence of an additional
500 mg/mL G418 (Invitrogen) or 1 mg/mL puromycin
(Calbiochem).
In vitro kinase assay
Approximately 5 mg puriﬁed GST proteins were incubated with
active AKT1 kinase (Upstate Biotechnology) and analyzed using
SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.
Side population analysis
Side population analysis was performed as described previously (19). Brieﬂy, cells were dissociated with Accutase, washed, and
resuspended in ice-cold HBSS/5% FBS at a ﬁnal concentration of
106 cells/100 mL. The CD44þ/CD24 cell population was then
determined by FACS.
Immunohistochemical staining
Immunohistochemical staining was performed as described
previously (14). Human breast tumor tissue specimens were
incubated with AKT1, b-TrCP, Twist1 or E-cadherin antibodies,
and a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody and then incubated
with an avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex. Visualization was
performed using amino-ethylcarbazole chromogen. Fisher exact
test and Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient were used for
statistical analysis. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.
Mouse model of lung metastasis
Tumor metastasis assays were performed using an intravenous
breast cancer mouse model as described previously (13). 4T1 cells
(1  105) were injected into the lateral tail vein of Balb/c mice.
Animals were weighed before each experimental end point, and
lung nodules were stained with India ink, excised, and counted

immediately. All animal procedures were conducted under the
approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX; protocol number 1014-07231). Detailed treatment protocol is described in the
Supplementary Information.

Results
Pathologic expression of AKT isoforms in breast cancer cells
AKT activation is correlated with unfavorable clinical prognosis
in many cancers including breast cancer. However, the roles of the
AKT isoforms in breast cancer pathogenesis and their therapeutic
potential have not been established. Thus, we examined the gene
expression proﬁle of the AKT isoforms by using a public dataset
generated from 917 cancer cell lines (CCLE; ref. 15) and grouped
them into epithelial and mesenchymal subtype based on the gene
expression proﬁle of CDH1, CDH2, vimentin, and ﬁbronectin. In
the mesenchymal subtype, AKT1 was signiﬁcantly downregulated
(Supplementary Fig. S1A), whereas AKT2 remains unchanged in
breast and stomach cancer cells (data not shown). AKT3 was
upregulated in the mesenchymal subtype in multiple cancers
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). To further dissect the expression of
AKT isoforms in breast cancer cell lines, unsupervised hierarchical
clustering analysis was performed on the basis of the ERBB2,
ESR1, PGR, and EMT proﬁles. Strikingly, we were able to distinguish basal-like from luminal type breast cancer cells with high
accuracy (90% properly segregated) from the gene list (Fig. 1A)
based on their genetic characteristics. AKT1 was expressed at a
lower level in either aggressive basal-like (vs. luminal) or mesenchymal-type breast cancer cells (vs. epithelial-type; Fig. 1B,
middle and right), whereas AKT3 was signiﬁcantly higher. Similarly, in another breast cancer dataset containing 54 cell lines
(20), the basal-like and mesenchymal breast cancer subtypes were
positively correlated with higher expression of AKT3 and inversely
correlated with AKT1 (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D). Next,
we asked whether a distinct group of clinical patient samples also
share a differential expression pattern of AKT isoforms and found
similar correlation using the NKI dataset (Fig. 1C; ref. 16) and the
UNC cohort (Fig. 1D; refs. 17, 18). While coexpression of AKT1,
AKT2, and AKT3 did not correlate with any speciﬁc breast cancer
subtypes (Fig. 1C and D, left), a signiﬁcant negative correlation
was observed between AKT1 and aggressive phenotype (Fig. 1C
and D, middle and right). To consolidate the differential regulation between the AKT isoforms, we ﬁrst examined the phosphorylation status of GSK3b, which is a well-known substrate of AKT
kinases (21), and found that phospho-GSK3b was similar in cells
transiently expressing constitutively active form of AKT1 (myrAKT1) or AKT2 (myr-AKT2; Supplementary Fig. S1E). Interestingly, only expression of myr-AKT1 activated the E-cadherin
promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E), supporting the
role of AKT1 in EMT inhibition. Consistently, overexpression myrAKT1 but not myr-AKT2 or myr-AKT3 in MDA-MB-231 cells
demonstrated an association with EMT regulation based on the
expression of EMT markers (Fig. 1F). We further examined the
protein expression of AKT isoforms in the metastatic breast cancer
cohort by immunohistochemical staining. The recurrence-free
survival of patients with higher expression of p-AKT S473, which
represents the phosphorylation level of all three AKT1, 2, and 3
isoforms, was signiﬁcantly worse than patients with lower p-AKT
S473 expression (Fig. 1G). In contrast, total AKT1 expression was
correlated with better patient survival (Fig. 1H). These results

suggested that each of the three AKT isoforms have a distinct

Twist1 physically associates with AKT1
Given the distinct regulatory nature of AKT isoform in breast
cancer cells, we sought to distinguish their functionality by
identifying their speciﬁc interacting partners. Immunoprecipitation of MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing HA-myr-AKT1 and
HA-myr-AKT2 indicated AKT1 but not AKT2 pulled down a
signiﬁcant amount of a 20-kDa protein (Supplementary Fig.
S2A), which was identiﬁed by mass spectrometric analysis as
Twist1 (with 72% sequence coverage). The complex formation
between endogenous AKT1 and Twist1 was further validated by
co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2B)
and DuoLink labeling (Supplementary Fig. S2C). In vitro GST

pull-down assay indicated that Twist1 interacted directly with
GST-AKT1 but not GST-AKT2 or GST alone (Supplementary Fig.
S2D). As AKT1 inhibited EMT, we asked whether repression of
EMT by AKT1 requires its interaction with EMT mediators, such as
Twist1, FOXC2, E12, and Snail. AKT1 associated with Twist1 but
not with the other EMT mediators (Supplementary Fig. S2E). A
reverse immunoprecipitation also showed that AKT1 but not
GSK3b, IKKa, or IKKb interacted with Twist1 (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). These results raise an interesting possibility that AKT1mediated EMT repression maybe regulated through the physical
and functional interaction with Twist1.

which of these two motifs might be phosphorylated by AKT1,
we expressed GST-Twist1 in two separate fragments: one containing amino acids 1–112 and the other 113–202 (Fig. 2B)
and then subjected them to an in vitro kinase assay with AKT1.
AKT1 strongly phosphorylated both GST-Twist1 fragments
(Fig. 2C) but phosphorylation was abolished when we mutated the consensus motif on Twist1. To pinpoint the phosphorylation potential in context of full-length Twist1, GST-Twist1
S42A (S42A), VA (T121V/S123A), and AVA (S42A/T121V/
S123A) mutants were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay.
Substitutions in both AKT phosphorylation motifs (Twist1
AVA) abolished AKT1-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 2D),
whereas substitutions in one or the other motif (S42A or
T121V/S123A) had little or no effect on Twist1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). These results suggested that complete phosphorylation of Twist by AKT1 in vitro requires phosphorylation
at S42, T121, and S123.

AKT1 phosphorylates Twist1 in vivo
To recapitulate AKT1-mediated Twist1 phosphorylation in vivo,
we coexpressed Flag-Twist1 and HA-tagged wild-type AKT1 (WT),
dominant negative AKT1 (DN), or myr-AKT1 followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody and immunoblotting
with phospho-AKT substrate antibody and phospho-RxRxxS/T
antibody (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Twist1, but not other EMT
regulators, was phosphorylated in the presence of myr-AKT1
(Supplementary Fig. S3D). Similar to the observations in vitro
(Fig. 2D), mutation of either S42 alone or both T121/S123 in
Twist1 did not affect its overall level of phosphorylation by AKT1,
whereas mutation of all three sites completely abrogated its
phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). Myr-AKT1 induced a noticeable
mobility shift of wild-type and S42A mutant Twist1 but not
Twist1-AVA or Snail (Supplementary Fig. S3E). In addition, AKT1
and AKT2 governed Twist1 functionality through differential
phosphorylation, in which AKT2 primarily phosphorylated Twist1
at S42 (Supplementary Fig. S3F), whereas AKT1 phosphorylated

AKT1 Induces b-TrCP–Mediated Twist1 Degradation

Twist1 at all three sites both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 2D and E). The
observed Twist1 S42 by AKT2 is in agreement with previously
reported Twist1 S42 phosphorylation by AKT (23).
To further differentiate AKT1- from AKT2-mediated Twist1
phosphorylation, we reexpressed AKT1 or AKT2 in the AKT1/2/3
knockdown cells. AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 were speciﬁcally knocked
down in MDA-MB-231 cells using pGZIP vector (Supplementary
Fig. S3G). AKT1 WT, AKT1 KD, AKT2 WT, and AKT2 KD were then
reexpressed (Supplementary Fig. S3H). Cells reexpressing AKT1
had Twist1 S42, T121 and S123 phosphorylation, whereas those
reexpressing AKT2 only had Twist1 phosphorylation at S42 (Fig.
2F). IGF1-induced phosphorylation of Twist1 was inhibited in
those treated with MK-2206, suggesting that Twist1 phosphorylation is regulated by PI3K signaling cascade (Fig. 2G).
Phosphorylation by AKT1 is required for Twist1 degradation
Next, we asked whether AKT1-mediated phosphorylation of
Twist1 affects its expression levels. In AKT1-deﬁcient mouse
embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF), Twist1 expression was higher compared with that in WT MEFs (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Twist1 expression was downregulated in the HeLa cells stably expressing myrAKT1 but not myr-AKT2, even though GSK3b was appropriately
phosphorylated by both AKT1 and AKT2 (Fig. 3B). Downregulation of AKT1 but not AKT2 by shRNA upregulated Twist1 expression (Fig. 3C, right). Consistent with an earlier study (6), silencing
AKT1 but not AKT2 expression induced EMT phenotypic change
in MCF 10A cells (Fig. 3C, left).
Next, we measured the protein turnover rate in the presence of
cycloheximide to determine the effect of AKT1-mediated phosphorylation on Twist1 protein stability. The turnover rate of
Twist1 in myr-AKT1–expressing cells was much faster compared
with those in myr-AKT2–expressing or empty vector control cells
(Fig. 3D). We further examined the protein half-life of Twist1 and
its three phospho-deﬁcient variants (S42A, VA, and AVA) and
found that the half-life of Twist1 AVA was signiﬁcantly longer
compared with that of Twist1 WT and Twist1 DDD phosphorylation-mimic mutant in the presence of myr-AKT1 (Fig. 3E).
AKT1 modulates b-TrCP–mediated Twist1 degradation
We noted that Twist1 contains one b-TrCP destruction box,
DSyXXS, which is also present in b-catenin, IkB, and Snail (Fig.
4A) (24, 25). Overexpression of b-TrCP in HEK293 cells led to a
rapid degradation of Twist1 (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Mutation
of this motif (DSLSNS to DALSNA; Fig. 4B) or knockdown of
b-TrCP (Supplementary Fig. S4B) stabilized Twist1 expression.
Similar to many b-TrCP substrates, induction of b-TrCP expression in MDA-MB-468 (Fig. 4C) and HeLa cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4C) by ciglitazone (CG), troglitazone (TG), or resveratrol
(26, 27) reduced Twist1 expression, supporting that b-TrCP
upregulation mediates Twist1 degradation. A double thymidine
(Fig. 4D, quantitation of Supplementary Fig. S4D) and thymidine/nocodazole assay (Supplementary Fig. S4E) indicated that
Twist1 protein but not mRNA was degraded during S to G2–M
phase. Moreover, downregulation of b-TrCP expression stabilized
Twist1, suggesting that b-TrCP is an authentic E3 ligase that
regulates Twist1 degradation at S-phase.
To further validate how AKT1 is involved in b-TrCP–mediated
Twist1 destabilization, we ectopically expressed b-TrCP WT and
b-TrCP DF (a b-TrCP variant that lacks the F-box domain) and
examined their effect on Twist1 ubiquitination. Expression of
b-TrCP WT but not b-TrCP DF induced speciﬁc ubiquitination of

Twist1 WT. Twist1 AVA was not ubiquitinated (Fig. 4E) in either
b-TrCP WT or b-TrCP DF–expressing cells. In addition, coexpression of b-TrCP facilitated AKT1-mediated Twist1 degradation
(Fig. 4F). Because the degradation machinery is enriched in the
cytoplasm, we next asked whether AKT1-mediated Twist1 phosphorylation regulated by subcellular localization. Nonphosphorylation-mimic Twist1 AVA, which is resistant to 26S proteasome-mediated degradation, primarily localized to the nucleus (Fig. 4G). Likewise, expression of myr-AKT1 DN (dominant
negative), which blocks endogenous AKT1 activity, led to an
accumulation of nonphosphorylated Twist1 WT in the nucleus
(Fig. 4G and Supplementary Fig. S5A). Cellular fractionation
assay also demonstrated the nuclear translocation of nonphosphorylated Twist1 AVA variant (Fig. 4H). Our ﬁndings suggest
that AKT1-mediated phosphorylation of Twist1 is required for its
translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where degradation occurs.
Twist1 AVA is a potent inducer of EMT
Because Twist1 is a key mediator during EMT progression, we
also investigated the effect of AKT1-mediated Twist1 phosphorylation in EMT using Twist1 phosphorylation-deﬁcient (Twist1
AVA) and phosphorylation-mimic (Twist1 DDD) mutants. To
this end, we established stable transfectants with empty vector
(EV), Twist1 WT, and AVA and DDD Twist1 mutants in MCF7
breast cancer cells, in which the basal level of endogenous Twist1
WT is low. Of the 35 clones screened, more than 15 clones
expressed Twist1 WT with little or no effect on E-cadherin expression and no apparent morphologic changes that resemble EMT.
Likewise, the Twist1 DDD stable transfectants did not induce any
E-cadherin loss or EMT phenotype. Interestingly, half of the 20
neomycin-resistant clones of Twist1 AVA transfectants underwent
morphologic changes that resembled EMT. Stable transfectants
with similar Twist1 expression levels were used for comparison
(Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C). To exclude
the random effect from stable transfectant selection, we infected
MDCK cells with replication-incompetent retroviruses expressing
Flag-Twist1 WT, AVA, and DDD. In both MCF7 and MDCK cells,
Twist1 AVA induced signiﬁcantly downregulated E-cadherin and
upregulated N-cadherin expression (Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary Fig. S5D). Vimentin was also selectively expressed in
Twist1 AVA–expressing cells (Fig. 5B, and Supplementary Fig.
S5C). RT-PCR analysis indicated that E-cadherin mRNA level was
partially reduced in MCF7-Twist1 WT cells but completely abrogated in MCF7-Twist1 AVA cells (Fig. 5C). These results suggest
that AKT1-mediated phosphorylation of Twist1 suppresses
expression of several EMT markers such as N-cadherin and
vimentin and derepresses Twist1-repressed E-cadherin. Blocking
Twist1 phosphorylation as exempliﬁed by the Twist1 AVAmutant–induced expression of EMT markers.
To further validate the association between Twist1 AVA mutant
and EMT phenotype, we performed several EMT-related functional assays using MCF7 stable transfectants. Although cell proliferation rate of Twist1 variants remained similar (Supplementary
Fig. S5E and S5F), cell invasion ability by a Transwell assay was
signiﬁcantly enhanced in MCF7 Twist1 AVA transfectants. MCF7Twist1 AVA cells also displayed accelerated migration by wound
healing assay compared with the WT and DDD mutant under
time-lapse microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Twist1 AVA
demonstrated aggressive phenotype as indicated by the high
percentage of migrating cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B). To further

To consolidate the role of Twist1 in AKT1-mediated EMT
repression, we knocked down Snail and Twist1 in shAKT1 clone
and found that downregulation of Twist1 but not Snail abolished
shAKT1-induced EMT (Supplementary Fig. S6E). We also stably
expressed myr-AKT1 DN in MCF 10A (shCTRL) and two Twist1
knockdown stable clones (shTW-1 and shTW-2) (13). Myr-AKT1
DN increased Twist1 expression and enhanced TGFb-induced
EMT in MCF 10A cells as measured by downregulation of Ecadherin and upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin expression. However, knocking down Twist1 inhibited TGFb-induced
EMT in AKT1 DN–expressing cells, whereas cells that received
shControl (shC) showed no effect (Fig. 5E). Thus, expression of
Twist1 in MCF 10A cells is required for TGFb/myr-AKT1 DNinduced EMT, establishing a role of Twist1 in the AKT1-mediated
EMT repression.

1458 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

Next, we asked whether AKT1 DN increases the metastatic
potential of breast cancer in vivo, and if so, whether the AKT1
DN-induced Twist1 expression plays a role in this process. Results
from an in vivo experimental metastasis assay by a lung colonization xenograft model showed that myr-AKT1 DN expression in
4T1-Luc cells enhanced metastatic potential as measured by the
number of lung colonization, and knockdown of Twist1 expression antagonized myr-AKT1 DN-induced metastasis (Fig. 5F).
AKT1 controls the molecular switch of Twist1 by T121 and S123

To differentiate AKT2-induced EMT via Twist1 S42 phosphorylation, a series of functional analyses was performed to distinguish the isoform-speciﬁc regulation in the context of Twist1.

AKT1 Induces b-TrCP–Mediated Twist1 Degradation

Fig. S7A) and ubiquitination (Supplementary Fig. S7B) compared
with the wild-type Twist1. Interestingly, mutation of the second
motif on Twist1 S42A (Twist1 AVA) robustly stabilized Twist1 by
blocking ubiquitination. These results suggest that T121 and S123
phosphorylation by AKT1 favor b-TrCP recognition for protein
degradation. We performed qChIP (Supplementary Fig. S7C) and
luciferase assay (Supplementary Fig. S7D) to evaluate the transcriptional activities of the Twist1 variants on the E-cadherin
promoter. We showed that Twist1 S42A by transient transfection
reduced its DNA binding ability and derepressed the transcriptional activity of the E-Cadherin promoter, which is in line with
prior studies showing AKT2 phosphorylates Twist1 at S42 to
induce EMT (28). Neither DNA binding nor transcriptional
repression of the E-cadherin promoter was affected by the Twist1
VA (T121V/S123A) mutant, which suggests that T121/S123 phosphorylation per se does not affect Twist1 binding afﬁnity. Results
from functional assays using Twist MCF7 stable transfectants by
retrovirus, however, indicated that Twist1 S42A lost its EMT
potential, whereas Twist1 AVA induced EMT phenotypic change
(Supplementary Fig. S7E) as well as cell invasion (Supplementary
Fig. S7F). The half-life of Twist1 S42A mutant was much shorter
than that of the AVA mutant (Supplementary Fig. S7A). The
additional phosphorylation at T121/S123 in Twist1 S42A likely
enhances its degradation by b-TrCP in the stable transfectants,
reducing its ability to induce EMT. Altogether, we propose a
model (Supplementary Fig. S7G) as follows: AKT2 phosphorylates Twist1 at S42, which reduces E-cadherin expression to induce
EMT, whereas AKT1 catalyzes two additional phosphorylation at
Twist1 T121 and S123, allowing b-TrCP to degrade Twist1, which
leads to inhibition of EMT.
Correlation of AKT1, b-TrCP, Twist1, and E-cadherin in human
tumor tissues
To validate the pathologic relevance of the identiﬁed mechanism, we studied the expression of AKT1, b-TrCP, Twist1, and Ecadherin in 104 human metastatic breast tumor specimens by
IHC staining. Twist1 was detected in 13 of 39 specimens with high
AKT1 expression but in 39 of the 45 specimens with low AKT1
expression, indicating that there is an inverse correction between
AKT1 and Twist1 expression. Consistent with this ﬁnding, we
found that AKT1 expression correlated with b-TrCP and E-cadherin expression (Supplementary Fig. S8 and Table S1).
Inhibition of AKT1 induces Twist1 upregulation and metastatic
potential
Multiple AKT inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials as
anticancer agents (29). The model shown in Supplementary Fig.
S7G raised the concern that the use of AKT inhibitors as anticancer
agents could potentially enhance EMT/metastasis while suppressing tumor growth. To this end, we tested this potential adverse
effect of a clinically used AKT inhibitor, MK-2206, which possesses differential inhibition toward speciﬁc AKT isoform (selective inhibitor of AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3 with IC50 of 5, 12, and 65
nmol/L, respectively; 30). As breast cancer cells with lower ratios
of AKT1/AKT2 are less sensitive to MK-2206 (31), we sought to
determine whether AKT1 inhibition by MK-2206 has potential to
induce EMT via Twist1 upregulation in breast cancer cells.
MCF10A cells were treated with 0.2 mmol/L MK-2206, which
enhanced TGFb-induced EMT (Fig. 6A, lane 4, 8, and 12 and
Supplementary Fig. S9A). MK-2206 alone also induced EMT in
MCF 10A cells but required a longer stimulation than TGFb

www.aacrjournals.org

treatment (Fig. 6A, lane 3, 7 and 11). Continuous treatment with
MK-2206 alone to passage 3 (3 days/passage) led to late EMT
morphologic changes similar to those by TGFb. In fact, MK-2206
mediated EMT primarily through inhibition of AKT1 as knockdown of AKT2 and AKT3 had no effect on the expression of EMT
markers (Supplementary Fig. S9B). Consistent with our results
from AKT1 knockdown cells (Fig. 3C), inhibition of AKT1 by MK2206 increases Twist1 stability by blocking Twist1 degradation
(Fig. 6A). To determine whether stabilization of Twist1 is required
for MK-2206–mediated EMT, MCF 10A cells carrying shCTRL or
shTwist1 (shTW) were treated with MK-2206 for 10 days. Downregulation of Twist1 inhibited MK2206-mediated cell migration,
invasion, and acquisition of EMT phenotype (Fig. 6B), suggesting
an indispensable role of Twist1 in MK-2206-mediated phenotypic
changes associated with EMT.
As the protein stability of Twist1 is tightly regulated by b-TrCP
(Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S4C), we asked whether destabilization of Twist1 by b-TrCP inducer, resveratrol, would reduce
MK-2206–mediated EMT. We ﬁrst treated MCF 10A cells with MK2206 to induce EMT followed by resveratrol (10 mmol/L) for
2 days. Resveratrol downregulated Twist1 and reverted MK-2206–
mediated phenotypic changes associated with EMT (Fig. 6C). At a
concentration of 10 mmol/L, resveratrol inhibited MK-2206–
mediated cell invasion (Fig. 6D) and migration ability
(Fig. 6E). Similar results were observed in 4T1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S9C). The possibility that resveratrol decreases the MK2206–mediated aggressiveness was further explored by investigating the effects of resveratrol on tumor metastasis in an animal
model. We inoculated 4T1 cells in Balb/c mice by tail vein
injection (13). Tumor-bearing mice were then treated with or
without MK-2206 and/or resveratrol. The metastatic nodules in
the lungs were resected from each mouse and quantiﬁed by a
dissecting microscope (Fig. 6F). The number of lung metastasis
was signiﬁcantly reduced in mice cotreated with both MK-2206
and resveratrol but not in mice that received each agent alone (Fig.
6G). In addition, the combined therapy of MK-2206 and resveratrol also prolonged mice survival by 20% (Fig. 6H). These
observations suggest that Twist1 is a key factor in MK-2206–
induced EMT, cell migration/invasion, and lung colonization in
breast cancer and that destabilization of Twist1 by inducing
b-TrCP through resveratrol enhances the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
MK-2206 for breast cancer treatment (Fig. 6I).

Discussion
Some discrepancies observed in AKT10 s role in breast cancer
metastasis have been reported. For instance, overexpression of
AKT1 suppresses tumor invasion but accelerates ErbB2-mediated
mammary tumorigenesis (7). In other studies, AKT1 knockout
impaired lung metastasis in MMTV-ErbB2/Neu and MMTV-PyMT
transgenic mice (32, 33). While this may be attributed to the
differences between the transgenic models tested, one possibility
could be that knockout of AKT1 already compromised the ErbB2and PyMT-induced primary tumor formation, which may in turn
impair AKT1-mediated EMT and metastasis inhibition.
Consistent with the literature (4–6, 34, 35), our study provides
a comprehensive pathologic and mechanistic understanding of
the complexity of AKT isoform regulation in breast cancer EMT.
Multiple dataset analysis identiﬁed the inhibitory nature of AKT1
in EMT, which was further validated by patient sample analysis in
which a correlation between AKT1 expression and improved

patient survival in invasive breast cancer cohorts was observed. In
vitro and in vivo studies using the Twist1 AVA mutant demonstrated that AKT1 mediates EMT inhibition in breast cancer cells,
further supporting an inverse relationship between AKT1 expression and EMT from gene expression analysis. It is worthwhile to
mention that stable clones of Twist1 variant were selected with
equal expression level; however, Twist1 AVA still exhibited obvious EMT, suggesting other function of Twist1 AVA may exist to
stimulate EMT in addition to its ability to increase Twist1 protein
stability. Although AKT1 inhibits EMT in breast cancer, AKT1 was
shown to induce EMT in squamous cancer and sarcoma (36–38).
Thus, it is of importance to understand how cell-type–speciﬁc AKT
isoform expression, localization, and activities elicit diverse functions in cancer cells.
AKT2 phosphorylates Twist1 at S42 to enhance Twist1-mediated E-cadherin suppression (23). As AKT1 also phosphorylates
Twist1 at S42, AKT1 may exert dual and contradictory inﬂuences
on Twist1. According to our data, the complexity may be minimal
as Twist1 protein expression is downregulated as long as AKT1 is

1460 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

expressed in breast cancer. These results are also in agreement with
many published research showing that AKT1 inhibits EMT in
breast cancer (4–6, 34, 35). Hence, we believe that Twist1 S42mediated EMT induction by AKT1 may exist but is outpaced by
AKT1-mediated negative regulation through T121 and S123
phosphorylation in breast cancer.
In summary, we have identiﬁed a novel AKT1/b-TrCP/
Twist1/E-cadherin signaling axis in breast cancer cells (Supplementary Table S1). The AKT1- and AKT2-speciﬁc EMT regulation of Twist1 phosphorylation appear to have differential
effects depending on the cellular context. Dissecting the effect
of each AKT isoform, in this case, AKT1, enabled us to further
understand how breast cancer cells undergo EMT and reach
metastatic potential. Moreover, resveratrol may provide therapeutic beneﬁts by limiting the metastatic potential when
administering MK-2206.
