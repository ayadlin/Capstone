METHODS. All cytology-negative TIS-imaged ThinPrep Pap tests (TPPT) with

DNA) in women with negative Papanicolaou (Pap) test results provides a measure
of residual risk for cervical neoplasia after cytology screening. The purpose of
this study was to document the prevalence of hrHPV DNA in several thousand
women ages 30 years with negative ThinPrep Imaging System (TIS)-imaged Pap
test results in a large academic hospital cytology laboratory.

hrHPV DNA tests that were performed by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) method from May 1,
2005 to November 20, 2006 were identified and reviewed. Imaged-negative Pap
test slides associated with a positive hrHPV DNA test result were rescreened
manually. Variation in hrHPV DNA prevalence was assessed for different age and
ethnic groups.

RESULTS. Of 8070 imaged cytology-negative TPPT from women ages 11 to 90
years, hrHPV DNA test results were also available. Among 7426 women ages 30
years with a cytology-negative, TIS-imaged, Pap test, a significant age-associated
decline in hrHPV DNA prevalence was noted, 3.4% in 3050 women ages 30–45
years, 2.4% in 7426 women ages 30–90 years, and 1.8% in 5491 women ages
40–90 years. The hrHPV DNA-positive rate was 2.3% in 6012 imaged cytologynegative white women and 4.1% in 739 imaged cytology-negative black women.

CONCLUSIONS. Very low HC2 hrHPV DNA rates in 7426 women ages 30 years
with cytology-negative, TIS-imaged, ThinPrep, Pap tests were similar to recently
published data from 1 other academic center and lower than rates reported in
previous studies on cytology-negative North American or European women
screened manually with conventional or liquid-based Pap tests. These data may
impact assessments of how best to combine cytology and HPV testing. Cancer

n 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
adjunctive high-risk Human Papillomavirus DNA (hrHPV DNA)
testing with cytology screening for women ages 30 years.1 Since
then, several clinical trials2 and modeling studies3–8 have attempted
to further evaluate various cervical cancer screening formulations by
using different combinations of conventional and liquid-based cervical cytology (LBC) and hrHPV DNA testing. One very recent modeling study by US Army clinical investigators concluded that the
most cost-effective combination screening strategy was LBC every 2

years with limited hrHPV DNA testing only after a
cytological finding of atypical squamous cells of
undetermined significance (ASCUS).3 These investigators concluded that routine cytology and hrHPV
DNA cotesting, although predicted in their model to
be the most successful strategy for preventing cervical cancer deaths, was questionably cost effective.
No published studies, however, have looked at the
impact of location-guided computer-assisted screening of LBC, approved by the FDA in 2003 and now
widely used in the US with the ThinPrep-Imaging
System (TIS),9 on evaluations of different possible
screening formulations that use both cytology and
hrHPV DNA testing. Available studies indicate that
this technology further enhances10,11 the improved
ability of LBC12,13 to reliably detect significant precancerous and neoplastic cervical lesions. Because
hrHPV DNA provides an objective measure of residual risk for cervical neoplasia after cytology screening, we have examined the prevalence of hrHPV DNA
in women with negative TIS-imaged cytology results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
After obtaining institutional review board approval at
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC),
a retrospective study was initiated. All Papanicolaou
(Pap) tests between May 2005 and November 20,
2006 (165,874 tests) were identified in a CoPath computer database (Cerner, Kansas City, Mo). Beginning
in May 2005, all hrHPV DNA test results were entered
routinely into the CoPath anatomic pathology database. During this period there were 159,975 (96.5%)
ThinPrep Pap tests (TPPT)14 (Cytyc, Marlborough,
Mass) and 5899 (3.5%) conventional Pap smears. The
current study focused on all patients with TPPT
reported as negative for intraepithelial lesion or
malignancy who also were tested for hrHPV DNA. All
specimens were processed and evaluated in the
pathology laboratory at Magee-Womens Hospital of
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and reported
with current Bethesda System 2001 terminology.
TPPT were prepared according to manufacturer’s
specifications from PreservCyt (Cytyc, Marlborough,
Mass) samples by using an automated processor
(ThinPrep 3000). Staining of slides was performed on a
Sakura Tissue Tek Automated Slide Stainer (Somagen
Diagnostics, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) according to
an FDA-approved manufacturer’s protocol. Locationguided computer-assisted screening of TPPT slides
was accomplished by using the ThinPrep Imaging System (TIS). The TIS performed analysis of batches of up
to 250 ThinPrep Pap test slides with specialized imaging software. For each slide, the locations of 22 micro-

293

scopic fields that contained cells or cell clusters of
interest were recorded. The imaged TPPT slides were
placed on cytotechnologist review scopes, and the
cytotechnologists reviewed the 22 fields in geographic
order. If the cytotechnologists found no abnormalities
on those 22 fields, the cytotechnologist could sign out
the case as negative. In all cases in which any of the 22
fields contained any abnormality, reactive or reparative cellular changes, or microorganisms, the cytotechnologists manually rescreened the entire TPPT slide.
All cases interpreted by cytotechnologists as abnormal
or as showing reactive or reparative changes were
referred to a pathologist for review.
hrHPV DNA testing was ordered by clinicians
according to several ordering options as follows:
reflex testing triggered by indeterminate abnormal
atypical squamous cell (ASC) Pap test results, routine
cotesting with Pap testing in women ages 30 years
(DNA with Pap), and hrHPV DNA cotesting regardless
of age or Pap test result (HPV regardless). If hrHPV
DNA was positive in cytologically negative Pap tests,
the Pap test slides were routinely manually rescreened
by the screening cytotechnologist, referred for further
manual rescreening by a quality-assurance cytotechnologist, and then, in addition, reviewed by a
pathologist.
hrHPV DNA detection was performed by the
commercially available FDA-approved Hybrid Capture
II (HC2) System15 (Digene Corp., Gaithersburg, Md),
which tests for high-risk and intermediate-risk HPV
types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and
68. This enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is
based on a sandwich-capture molecular hybridization
technique followed by a nonradioactive alkaline phosphatase reaction with chemoluminescence in microplates. Cases were categorized as either HC2 positive
or HC2 negative based on a threshold of 1 pg/mL HPV
DNA. For purposes of this study, all cytologically negative TPPT slides that tested positive for hrHPV DNA
were further reviewed independently by 2 cytopathologists. If questionable abnormalities were detected by
either cytopathologist, the slides were reviewed for
adjudication by a third senior cytopathologist.

Statistical Analysis
Confidence intervals for the positive rates of hrHPV
DNA were obtained. The positive rate of hrHPV DNA
for each age group was compared with that of the
reference group. The P-values were obtained for the
null hypothesis, which was that a positive rate of
hrHPV DNA for each age group equals that of the
reference group. Logistic regression16 was also used
to predict the rate change by using the age group as
the predictor. The predictor was coded as 0 (ages 11–

RESULTS
From May 1, 2005 to November 20, 2006, 165,874
Pap tests, including 159,975 TPPT and 5899 conventional Pap smears, were reviewed at Magee-Womens
Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
TPPT were routinely imaged with the TIS. hrHPV
DNA testing was ordered and completed in 8074
patients who also had negative TPPT results, including cases with reparative or reactive cellular changes.
Four cases were excluded in this study because we
retrospectively interpreted them as having cytologic
abnormalities on subsequent reviews.
A total of 8070 women with cytologically negative TPPT had hrHPV DNA testing completed. The
age of women with cytologically negative TPPT and
hrHPV DNA testing ranged from 11 to 90 years. The
age-related hrHPV DNA prevalence was analyzed
in10-year intervals with their 95% CI; P values are
listed in Table 1. Cytology-negative women who
tested positive for hrHPV DNA were significantly
more likely to be younger, with peak infection rate
occurring in women younger than 30 years (Table 2),
and there was a clear decline in the hrHPV DNA
prevalence in older age groups. The hrHPV DNA rate
in 1935 women ages 30–40 years was 4.0% and 1.8%
in 5491 women ages 41 years. In 3050 women ages
30–45 years, the age group surveyed in 1 previous
study,17 the hrHPV DNA rate was 3.4% (not shown in
Table 1).

with cytologically negative TPPT was analyzed by
logistic regression in 10-year intervals. The propor-

tion, px, of positive cases was predicted by age x
through the formula
px 5 exp(a 1 bx) 7 {1 1 exp(a 1 bx)}.
At 10-year intervals, the results were a 5 22.411
with a standard error of 0.152 and b 5 20.397 with a
standard error of 0.054. Both a and b were highly significant, indicating that hrHPV DNA prevalence was
strongly correlated with age.
Further analysis was carried out on hrHPV DNA
prevalence in TIS-imaged cytologically negative
TPPT; hrHPV DNA prevalence was highest (8.4%) in
women ages 11–29 years (Table 2) and decreased to
1.8% in women older than 40 years. hrHPV DNA
prevalence was statistically significantly higher in
women younger than 30 years compared with women
ages 30 years and older (Table 2). The difference in
hrHPV DNA prevalence between women ages 11 to 20
years and women ages 21 to 29 years was not statistically significant (P 5 .597). A statistically significant
decline in hrHPV DNA prevalence from 7% in women
21–29 years of age to 4.1% in women in 30–40 years of
age (comparison of hrHPV DNA prevalence between
women ages 21–29 years and ages 30–40 years,
P 5 .007) was observed. hrHPV DNA prevalence continued a statistically significant decline to 1.8% in
women ages 41–50 years (comparison of hrHPV DNA
prevalence between women ages 30–40 years and
41–50 years, P 5 3 3 1025). In subsequent age groups,
hrHPV DNA prevalence did not significantly continue
to decline and remained fairly stable in women after
the age of 40 years.
The relation between hrHPV DNA prevalence
and ethnicity was also analyzed in this study. Ethnic
background was available in 6814 (84.4%) of 8070
cytology-negative women who had hrHPV DNA
results, with the following distribution, 6012 white,
739 black, 59 Asian, 4 Hispanic, and 1256 unknown
women. The percentage distribution by ethnic background was 88.2%white women, 10.9% black women,
and 0.9% other. The overall hrHPV DNA-positive rate
was 2.3% (95% CI, 1.9%–2.7%) in white women, and

The odds ratio for hrHPV prevalence between white
and black women is 0.559. For both black and white
women, the hrHPV DNA rate in TIS-imaged cytology-negative women older than 30 years of age was
\3.5% (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
The prevalence of hrHPV DNA detected by the FDAapproved HC2 test method in general-screening
groups of North American and European women
with manually screened cytologically negative conventional and LBC Pap test results has been reported
to vary from 5.4% to 17.1%.18–23 In our study, hrHPV
DNA-positive rates declined significantly in women
ages 30 years, as noted in numerous other studies.22–25 In at least 1 other study, a very low hrHPV
DNA rate of 3.9% was also reported in 1000 cytology
normal women ages 30 years30–45 who had been
screened with TIS-imaged TPPT.17 The current study
confirms and extends those observations with a
larger dataset of more than 8000 cytologically negative patients with HC2 hrHPV DNA test results after
TIS location-guided computer-assisted screening of
TPPT. The very low rates of hrHPV DNA also noted
here in the relatively small sample (8%) of imaged
cytology-negative women ages \30 years probably
reflects a variety of factors, including selective testing
of a relatively affluent group of low-risk young
women willing to pay for testing not covered by
most local insurance plans, the lower hrHPV DNA
prevalence at this study site documented in the
ASCUS/LSIL Triage Study For Cervical Cancer (ALTS)
(unpublished data), and the efficacy of the TIS in

295

identifying hrHPV DNA-positive cases not identified
in routine manual screening. The high proportion of
white women in the study population clearly
impacted the very low hrHPV DNA rates detected in
cytologically negative women in this study. Although
hrHPV DNA prevalence varied significantly in imaged
cytology-negative black and white women, very low
hrHPV DNA rates were documented in both groups
for women ages 30 years with negative TIS-imaged
TPPT.
In 2003, the FDA approved the HC2 HPV DNA
test for adjunctive use along with Pap testing in cervical screening of women ages 30 years and older.1
The high rate of hrHPV DNA test results in women
younger than 30 years of age was judged, at that
time, to preclude broader routine application of
adjunctive cotesting in younger women. A major
rationale for FDA approval for women ages 30 years
was the low risk for development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia CIN31 lesions in women who
tested negative with both Pap testing and HC2
hrHPV DNA testing.26 Cost-benefit analyses available
at that time also suggested that the increased cost of
combining HPV DNA testing with cytology could be
somewhat offset by increasing the screening interval
for double-negative women ages 30 years.27
In our laboratory, hrHPV DNA was detected by
HC2 in only 2.4% of 7426 women older than 30 years
of age with cytology negative TIS-imaged TPPT. The
ability of a new cytology-based method to identify
negative Pap-test slides in women with very low residual hrHPV DNA rates suggests that the cost effectiveness of adding routine hrHPV DNA cotesting to
TIS-imaged Pap testing needs to be re-evaluated
against a more selective strategy of reflex hrHPV
DNA testing limited to patients with indeterminate
(atypical) Pap test results. Bidus’ US Army evaluation,
for example, showed that a strategy of LBC and
reflex-limited HPV testing every 2 years was clearly
cost effective with an estimated incremental costper-life-year saved of $56,728.3 This cost-effective
strategy dominated routine hrHPV DNA and Pap
cotesting at both 2-year and 3-year intervals because
the significantly higher costs associated with routinely combining hrHPV DNA testing (CPT code
87621; 2007 Medicare payment $49.04) with LBC
(CPT code 88142; 2007 Medicare payment $28.31) for
routine primary screening. The cost disadvantage for
routine primary hrHPV DNA cotesting is not significantly different when HPV testing is combined with
TIS-imaged Pap screening (CPT code 88175; 2007
Medicare payment $37.01). Detailed cost-effectiveness studies that use system data are being planned
in collaboration with University of Pittsburgh econo-

mists. In 1 preliminary cost-effectiveness model evaluation, the TIS was judged to be a highly cost-effective screening strategy.28
The likelihood of cytology-negative patients with
a single, positive, HC2 hrHPV DNA test of developing
highly significant (CIN31) precancerous or malignant lesions in long-term (10-year) follow-up appears
to be very low. In the Portland, Oregon, National
Cancer Institute prospective risk study that used conventional Pap smears rather than LBC, the 10-year
cumulative risk of developing CIN31 lesions was
3%–6% for conventional cytology-negative HC2
hrHPV DNA-positive women.29–32 In another more
recent Danish prospective risk study that also used
conventional Pap smears, the 10-year CIN31 risk
reported in cytology-negative hrHPV DNA-positive
patients was somewhat higher at 13.6%–23% and was
highest in older patients.33 Given data from prospective risk studies29–33 and the very low hrHPV DNA
prevalence here in TIS-imaged, Pap-negative women
ages 30 years, the long-term risk of undetected significant cervical disease in our TIS-imaged, Pap-negative patients appeared to be extremely low. Future
trials will need to compare the low risk of undetected
significant cervical disease after imaged screening
to the risk of undetected significant cervical disease
in patients with negative HC2 hrHPV DNA test
results21,34 One recent editorial, for example, argued
that according to today’s achievable standards, a
range of 89%–95% hrHPV DNA-test sensitivity is acceptable.35 We are now beginning a long-term follow-up study of TIS-imaged cytology negative hrHPV
DNA-positive women in this large integrated health
plan practice.
