ABSTRACT
Chemoresistance in cancer has previously been attributed to gene mutations
or deficiency. Caspase mutations or Bax deficiency can lead to resistance to cancer
drugs. We recently demonstrated that Bak initiates a caspase/Bax-independent
cell death pathway. We show that Plumbagin (PL) (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4napthoquinone), a medicinal plant-derived naphthoquinone that is known to have
anti-tumor activity in a variety of models, induces caspase-independent cell death in
HCT116 Bax knockout (KO) or MCF-7 Bax knockdown (KD) cells that express wildtype (WT) Bak. The re-expression of Bax in HCT116 Bax KO cells fails to enhance the
PL-induced cell death. Additionally, Bak knockdown by shRNA efficiently attenuates
PL-induced cell death. These results suggest that PL-induced cell death depends
primarily on Bak, not Bax, in these cells. Further experimentation demonstrated that
p53 Ser15 phosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation mediated Bak activation
and subsequent cell death. Knockdown of p53 or a p53 Ser15 mutant significantly
inhibited p53 mitochondrial translocation and cell death. Furthermore, we found that
Akt mediated p53 phosphorylation and the subsequent mitochondrial accumulation.
Taken together, our data elaborate the role of Bak in caspase/Bax-independent cell
death and suggest that PL may be an effective agent for overcoming chemoresistance
in cancer cells with dysfunctional caspases.

several key mediators of apoptosis that are mutated in
chemoresistant cancer cells, such as p53 and Akt [3, 4].
The caspase family of cysteinyl-proteases plays key roles
in the initiation and execution of programmed cell death,
and mutations in these proteins have been speculated to
be the leading cause of cancer therapy chemoresistance
[5, 6]. Triggering the caspase independent death pathways
has thus become an attractive alternative approach to
eradicating tumor cells.
The mitochondria are central relaying stations for
both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent death
pathways [7, 8]. Mitochondria respond to multiple death
stimuli, such as those of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and
accounted for 7.6 million deaths (approximately 13% of
all deaths) in 2008. Deaths from cancer are projected to
continue rising, with an estimated 13.1 million deaths
projected to occur in 2030 [1, 2]. Therefore, it is necessary
to study tumorigenesis mechanisms to find more effective
treatment methods. However, both intrinsic and acquired
drug resistance are serious problems in cancer treatment.
Recent evidence has suggested that the failure
of drug-induced apoptosis may be an underlying cause
of resistance in cancers. Recent studies have identified

proteins, which includes Bax/Bak; these proteins induce
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the release
of apoptotic molecules such as Smac, AIF and endoG
[9–11]. AIF and endoG start a death pathway that can execute
apoptosis-like cell death in the absence of caspase [10, 12].
Bax can induce the release of AIF in caspase-independent cell
death [13]. Bak can trigger the release of Cytochrome c (Cyt
c) from mitochondria in HCT Bax KO cells [14]. However,
the function of Bak, excluding the effect of Bax, in caspaseindependent cell death is still unclear.
Our previous study demonstrated that Akt could
mediate Bax activation through p53 mitochondrial
accumulation [9]. In the present study, we found that Akt
could induce p53 phosphorylation and mitochondrial
translocation. Activated p53 triggers Bak-dependent
and Bax/caspase-independent cell death. These results
will help us better understand the function of Bcl-2
protein family members in apoptosis and cancer therapy.
Furthermore, our experiments may provide a theoretical
basis for overcoming chemoresistance in cancer cells.

treatment of the anti-Fas cross-linking antibody and CHX
resulted in caspase-3 cleavage and cell death (Supplementary
Figure 2A). Caspase-3 activation and cell death, however,
were impeded in the presence of zVAD (Supplementary
Figure 2A and 2B), as previously reported [16]. Similarly,
using immunofluorescent staining, we found that PL induced
the release of Cyt c, AIF and endoG in HCT116 Bax KO
cells (Supplementary Figure 3). We also examined the
effect of PL on HCT116 cells. We found that PL triggers
casapse-3 activation in HCT116 or HCT116 Bax KO cells
but that zVAD treatment inhibited caspase-3 cleavage
(Supplementary Figure 2C). However, caspase inactivation
by zVAD could not efficiently decrease the PL-induced cell
death in HCT116 or HCT116 Bax KO cells (Supplementary
Figure 2D and 2E). These results indicate that PL treatment
can induce caspase-dependent and caspase-independent
cell death. Moreover, caspase-independent cell death is
necessary for PL-induced cell death.
Our data demonstrate that PL can trigger cell death
in HCT116 Bax KO cells. Because Bak contributes to Baxindependent cell death [14], we speculated that Bak could
mediate PL-induced Bax/caspase-independent cell death.
To compare the impact of Bak and Bax on cell death, we
transfected Bax, Bak or both shRNA into HCT116 or
MCF-7 cells to obtain different cell lines (Supplementary
Figure 4A and 4B). We then detected cell death in the
different HCT116 cells after PL treatment with or without
the addition of zVAD treatment (Figure 2B). We found
that Bak had a more important role in PL-induced cell
death than did Bax (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure
4C), although our data revealed that PL could induce Bax
activation in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure 4D).
We then transfected a Bax vector into HCT116 Bax KO
cells to obtain stable the Bax transfectant clones Bax#2
and Bax#3 (Figure 3A). We selected Bax#3 as a cell
model because Bax expression was highest in this clone.
We found that the restoration of Bax expression was
not effective in increasing death following PL treatment
(Figure 3B). These results confirm that cell death by PL
does not depend on the loss of Bax and suggest that PL
utilizes the Bak pathways to execute cell death.
To further investigate the contribution of Bak
to PL-induced cell death, we stably transfected Bax
shRNA into MCF-7 cells to knock down Bax expression.
Western blot analysis confirmed the lack of Bax and
Bak expression in HCT116 Bax KO and MCF-7 Bax
KD cells (Supplementary Figure 4E). Our data revealed
that PL induces a Bak conformational change and
oligomerization in HCT116 Bax KO and MCF-7 Bax
KD cells (Figure  4A). Additionally, PL induces Bak
oligomerization in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure
4F). We then knocked down Bak expression in HCT116
Bax KO cells. As illustrated in Figure 4B, Bak shRNA
effectively decreased Bak expression and the cytosolic
release of AIF and endoG after PL treatment. Annexin V/
PI staining also demonstrated that cell death is inhibited

RESULTS
PL induces caspase-independent cell death
We first determined the apoptotic effect of PL in MCF7 (caspase-3 deficient) cells. We treated the cells with PL at
the indicated concentrations, and apoptosis was assessed by
a DNA fragmentation ELISA assay. As depicted in Figure
1A, PL efficiently induced cell death in MCF-7 cells. CP
treatment, however, had no effect on cell death. We then used
a pan caspase inhibitor in MCF-7 cells called MCF-7/zVAD.
Even when the caspase activity was inhibited by zVAD, PL
treatment was still sufficient to induce cell death. However,
STS or VP16 treatment had no effect on cell death (Figure
1A). Flow cytometry analysis with PI staining revealed that
PL could induce cell death in MCF-7 and MCF-7/zVAD
cells (Figure 1B). Further experiments demonstrated that
PL effectively induces Cyt c, AIF and endoG release from
the mitochondria to the cytosol (Figure 1C). AIF condenses
chromatin and endoG cleaves chromatin DNA into
nucleosomal fragments independently of caspases [12, 15],
leading to cell death. Our data also demonstrate that either
AIF or endoG siRNA only partially attenuated cell death but
that AIF and endoG double siRNA efficiently inhibited cell
death by PL treatment (Supplementary Figure 1).

Bak activation is necessary for PL-induced
caspase-independent cell death
We also found that PL induced apoptosis in HCT116
Bax KO cells. Moreover, the inhibition of caspase activity
by zVAD only partially prevented cell death in PL-treated
HCT116 Bax KO cells (Figure 2A). We treated HCT116 Bax
KO with an anti-Fas antibody and cycloheximide (CHX),
as previously described [16], and found that the combined

with Bak to release Cyt c [17]. We therefore wanted to
determine whether p53 is involved in Bak-induced cell death
following PL treatment. We first detected p53 mitochondrial
translocation. Our data confirmed p53 translocation from

levels of p53 contributed to p53 accumulation and Bak
activation in our experiments. We first examined the
p53Ser15 phosphorylation. Our experiments showed
that p53Ser15 phosphorylation (p-p53) is increased in
HCT116 Bax KO cells after PL treatment, regardless
of whether there was zVAD pretreatment. Similarly,
PL also induces p-p53 in MCF-7 Bax KD and MCF7 cells (Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure 5A).
Moreover, immunofluorescent staining also revealed the
accumulation of p-p53 in the mitochondria of HCT116
Bax KO cells (Supplementary Figure 6). To further
ascertain the importance of p53Ser15 phosphorylation in
cell death, we constructed a pCDNA3.1-p53S15A mutant
plasmid and transfected it into cells. We found that our
mutant significantly inhibits p53 translocation as well as
the release of AIF and endoG. Moreover, Bak activation
was prevented by transfection with the p53S15A mutant
(Figure 6B). Flow cytometry detection of Annexin V
staining confirmed that the p53 mutant inhibits cell death
(Figure 6C).
To further understand whether the p53S15A mutant
affects endogenous p53 activation, we constructed HAp53 WT and S15A vectors and transfected them into
HCT116 Bax KO cells. We found that a p53 antibody
could reliably distinguish exogenous and endogenous p53
expression, as described previously [20] (Supplementary
Figure 7A). Our data show that the p53S15A mutant
inhibits exogenous and endogenous p53 mitochondrial
translocation (Supplementary Figure 7B).

Previous study has demonstrated that Akt
contributed to chemoresistance by attenuating the
phosphorylation of p53 [21]. Our study also showed that
the Akt-p53 pathway mediates Bax activation in cell
death. We then determined whether Akt could affect the
phosphorylation or mitochondrial translocation of p53 as
well as Bak activation. We transfected an Akt1 vector into
HCT116 Bax KO or MCF-7 cells and then treated these
cells with PL. We found that Akt overexpression increases
the phosphorylation of GSK3 (p-GSK3), a downstream
target of Akt [22], indicating that Akt signaling activity
is enhanced in these cell lines. Our data also show
that Akt1 transfection inhibits the phosphorylation or
mitochondrial translocation of p53, the subsequent
release of AIF and endoG and Bak activation (Figure
7A and Supplementary Figure 5D). To further ascertain
whether Akt mediates Bak activation through p53
activation, we transfected DN-Akt into HCT116 Bax KO
cells and found that p-GSK3 decreased, which suggests
a reduction in Akt signaling activity. Our data show that
p53 phosphorylation and accumulation, AIF and endoG
release and Bak oligomerization are all increased relative
to control cells (Figure 7B). Our experiments also reveal
that LY294002, a PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor, efficiently
decreases the phosphorylation levels of Akt (p-Akt).

than 2,500 years [24]. There is evidence that the antitumor properties of PL are mediated by the inactivation of
the Akt/NF-kB signaling pathway and by the inactivation
of MMP-9 and VEGF, two proteins that are considered
important for the processes of invasion, angiogenesis and
metastases [23–26]. Previous studies have confirmed that
PL triggers a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane
potential and initiates the intrinsic cell death pathway.
PL can induce the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by
mediating the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
and p53 and the inactivation of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL [23–
25]. Those researchers have investigated the anti-tumor
mechanism of PL and indicated that apoptosis plays an
important role in the effects of PL treatment. However, the
function of PL on cancer chemoresistance is still unknown.
It is well established that some apoptosis-related genes
mutate in cancer and can lead to cancer chemoresistance
[4, 27]. For example, MCF-7 cells, which lack a functional

It is important to isolate natural compounds for
the treatment and/or prevention of cancer. A major
prerequisite in the use of these agents is that they be
physiologically non-toxic and inert towards normal cells.
PL is such a compound [23]. PL is a naturally occurring

lung tumorigenesis [31]. These reports revealed that a
deficiency in the caspase family of proteins might affect
tumorigenesis and cancer therapy outcomes. Thus, it is
necessary to find alternative treatments for chemoresistant
cancer due to dysfunctional caspases.
Because previous studies have reported that PL
could trigger death in MCF-7 cells [23], we speculated that
PL could induce caspase-independent cell death in cancer
cells. Our experiments confirmed that PL initiated cell
death in MCF-7, MCF-7/zVAD, HCT116 and HCT116
Bax KO/ zVAD cells. Although PL could induce caspase-3
cleavage in wild type HCT116 cells, the inhibition of
caspase activation had little effect on cell death. Our data
also revealed that the release of AIF and endoG from
mitochondria is an important part of PL-induced cell
death. It has been reported that AIF and endoG translocate
to the nucleus to trigger caspase-independent cell death
[12]. The release of AIF and endoG from mitochondria
can induce DNA cleavage and oligonucleosomal DNA
breakdown in a sequential fashion [12, 15].
Mitochondria respond to multiple death stimuli,
including those involving the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
family of proteins, such as Bax and Bak, which induce
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and cause the
release of apoptotic molecules [9, 14, 32, 33]. Moreover,
Bak can induce cell apoptosis in a Bax-dependent or
Bax-independent manner [14, 16, 34]. Our experiments
demonstrate that Bak mediates Cyt c (data not shown),
AIF and endoG release after PL treatment, independent
of Bax. Other studies have revealed that the release of
AIF and endoG by Bax/Bak is dependent on caspase
activation [10]. Some studies have also demonstrated that
Bax induces the release of AIF in a caspase-independent
cell death pathway [13]. However, our research demon­
strated that Bak regulates a caspase-independent cell
death pathway through AIF and endoG release. Our
study excluded the function of Bax in AIF and endoG
release and affirms that Bak can initiate a caspase/Baxindependent cell death pathway.
Both our previous [9] and present study confirm that
p53 accumulates in the mitochondria during the process
of cell death. Our previous study affirmed the effect of
mitochondrial p53 on Bax activation. In the present
work, we reveal that mitochondrial p53 can induce Bak
activation. Indeed, mitochondrial p53 induces both Bax
and Bak activation [17, 35, 36]. Moreover, recent studies
have shown that mitochondrial p53Ser15 phosphorylation
can mediate Bak activation [19]. Our research also
provided the evidence to support this conclusion.
Nieminen and his colleagues demonstrated that the
Myc-AMPK pathway mediates p53 phosphorylation and
mitochondrial accumulation [19]. However, our research
revealed that the Akt pathway mediates changes in p53.
These findings highlight certain differences between
our study and that by Nieminen and his colleagues. We
used cancer cells as cell model, whereas Nieminen and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

his colleagues used immortalized epithelial cell lines.
Furthermore, they utilized Myc-inducible systems, which
can enhance Myc expression, to regulate the change of
protein activation and cell death. We used PL, a chemical
agent, to mediate that alteration. We could not detect a
change in Myc expression and AMPK activity (data not
shown) in our system. This finding indicates that PL
utilizes a separate upstream pathway to regulate p53 and
Bak activation. In fact, Fraser and his colleagues revealed
that activated Akt attenuated p53 phosphorylation in
CP-induced cell death [21]. Our data further promote
the findings that Akt mediates p53 phosphorylation and
mitochondrial translocation as well as Bak activation.
Moreover, the study by Nieminen and his colleagues
found that Myc enhances p53 expression in cells, but
our data showed that PL has no effect on p53 expression.
This result further suggests that we have found a different
mechanism underlying the regulation of p53 activation.
It is noteworthy that both our research and the
study by Nieminen and his colleagues revealed that p53
had no nuclear accumulation during apoptosis. Nieminen
and his colleagues found that active Myc did not lead to
an up-regulation of any of the examined transcriptional
targets of p53. Additionally, the p53 transactivationdeficient mutant induces Bak activation [19]. We utilized
a Bax luciferase plasmid to detect p53 transactivation
and found that p53 does not efficiently activate the Bax
promoter (Supplementary Figure 8), which suggests that
transactivation of p53 does not contribute to PL-induced
cell death. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that
transactivation-deficient mutant p53 can still translocate
to mitochondria [37]. Future studies should focus on
investigating the detailed mechanism behind p53 activation
by upstream factors and subsequent cell death events.
In summary, we elucidate the molecular mechanism
of PL action in cancer cells with the absence of caspase
activity and provide the first evidence that Bak activation
is an important factor for PL-induced cell death with
dysfunctional caspase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
Akt negatively regulates p53-mediated Bak activation,
independent of caspases (Supplementary Figure 9). A
thorough understanding of how PL works in cells may
improve the treatment outcomes for human cancer.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides
were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) with
sequences targeting Bax (5′- AACUGAUCAGAACCAU
CAUGG-3′), Bak (5′-AACCGACGCUAUGACUCAG
AG-3′), AIF (5′-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC-3′),
endoG (5′-AAGAGCCGCGAGUCGUACGUG-3′) and
p53 (5′-CGGCAUGAACCGGAGGCCCAU-3′). For
Bax or Bak construction, the siRNA was cloned into the
pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro plasmid. pCDNA3.1-Bax plasmid
was a gift from Quan Chen (Chinese Academy of Sciences,
Beijing, China). Dominant negative (DN) Akt1 was a
gift from Dr. Michael J. Quon (University of Maryland
at Baltimore, Baltimore, Maryland,USA). The DN-Akt
with substitutions of Ala for Lys179 in the ATP binding
domain, as well as for the regulatory phosphorylation
sites, Thr308 and Ser473, was created and subcloned into
pCIS2 as described [3, 38–40]. The constitutively active
Akt1 construct HA-PKB-T308D/S473D was obtained as
previously described [41, 42]. p53 cDNA was purchased
from Origene (Rockville, MD, USA) as previously
described [43] and subcloned into pCDNA3.1 vector
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or pSELECT N-HA-Zeo
(Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA).The p53 S15A mutant
was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu-ultra
poly-merase (Stratagen, La Jolla, CA, USA) followed by
DpnI digestion (Fermentas Inc., Glen Burnie, MD, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Apoptosis assays
Three methods were used to assess PL-induced
apoptotic cell death: detection of DNA fragmentation with
the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics),
Western blot analysis of Cyt c, AIF or endoG release
and measurement of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry
(PI staining for sub-G1 or Annexin/PI). The Cell Death
Detection ELISA quantified the apoptotic cells by detecting
the histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) generated by the apoptotic cells [9].

Cell fractionation and western blot analysis
Mitochondria, nuclear and cytoplasm from cells
were fractionated by differential centrifugation as
previously described [9, 45]. Cytosol, mitochondria,
nuclear extracts, total lysates and immunoprecipitates
were analyzed by Western blot with antibody dilutions as
follows: actin at 1:20,000; AIF, endoG, p53, Akt, CoxIV
at 1:2,000; and Bax, Bak, Cyt c at 1:1,000.

Bak or bax oligomerization and bak
conformational change

Cell culture and transfection
MCF-7, HCT116 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. MCF-7 cells were
maintained at a subconfluent state in RPMI 1640
containing 10% FCS, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200
μg/ml streptomycin in a humidifiedatmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37°C. HCT116 cells were incubated in DMEM
media supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillinstreptomycin. HCT116 Bax KO cells were the gift from
Quan Chen (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing,
China) [32].
For siRNA or shRNA transfection, cells were seeded
on 6-well plates and then transfected with the appropriate
plasmid DNA or siRNA using the manufacturers’
protocols. Typically, cells were seeded on coverslips in
the 6-well plates, and then 1 μg of plasmid DNA or 100
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cells were treated with agents and incubated with
1 mM BMH in 10% DMSO or DMSO alone for 30 min
at 25°C. After centrifugation at 5000 g for 25 min at 4°C,
the reaction was split into supernatant and pellet fractions.
The pelleted material (10 mg total protein) was separated
by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Bak
antibody to detect Bak or Bax oligomerization [16]. Bak
conformational change was performed as described [46].
Briefly, Cells were lysed in 1% CHAPS buffer, and 250 μg
of protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-Bak (Ab-1;
Merck), which only recognizes Bak that has undergone
a conformation change. Immunoprecipitated protein was
then subjected to immunoblot analysis by using anti-Bak
(Santa Cruz) as primary antibodies.

Immunofluorescence staining
The experiments were performed according to
our previous report [42]. Cells were seeded in 24-well
plates with Lab-Tek Chamber Slides with a Cover (Nalge
Nunc International, Naperville, IL) in 500 μl medium and
incubated overnight. Cells were then treated with PL for
48 h. Medium was removed and cells were fixed in 4%
formaldehyde containing 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 15 min
at room temperature (RT). After rinsing with cold PBS (pH
7.4), cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10
min at RT. After blocking with 5% goat serum, Cytochrome
c (7H8.2C12, BD Pharmingen, USA), AIF, endoG or p-p53
(1:100 dilution) was added, and the fixed cells were incubated
with antibodies at 37°C for 1 h followed by incubation with
anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Millipore, 1:128 dilution) for 1 h.
After removal of antibodies, cells were rinsed with PBS and
mounted with 90% glycerol. Fluorescence was immediately
observed using an Olympus DP72 microscope.
