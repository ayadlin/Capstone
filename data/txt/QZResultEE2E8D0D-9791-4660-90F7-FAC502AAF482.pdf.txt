ABSTRACT
Recent reports showed that regulator of Cullins-1 (ROC1) play an important role
in tumor progression in a tumor-specific manner. However, the role and mechanism
of ROC1 in esophageal cancer remains elusive. Here we demonstrated that ROC1
was overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, which was positive
associated with poor prognosis of esophageal cancer patients. ROC1 knockdown
significantly inhibited the growth of esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
Mechanistically, ROC1 silencing induced G2 cell cycle arrest and triggered apoptosis
by accumulating the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA. Consistently, the downregulation
of NOXA expression via siRNA substantially attenuated apoptosis induced by ROC1
silencing. These findings suggest that ROC1 is an appealing drug target for esophageal
cancer.

was associated with poor prognosis of several cancers,
such as non-muscle-invasive bladder transitional cell
carcinoma (NMIBC) [9], gastric cancer [8, 10] and liver
cancer [12]. Dysfunction of ROC1 induced embryonic
death and abnormal meiosis [13]. These reports suggested
that ROC1 could act as an attractive anticancer target.
However, there is little known about the expression and
role of ROC1 in esophageal cancer.
Here, for the first time, we reported that ROC1 was
overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas
tissues, which is positive correlation with poor prognosis
of esophageal cancer patients. Knockdown of ROC1
effectively inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo,
induced G2 cell cycle arrest and triggered apoptosis by
accumulating the p21, p27, WEE1 or pro-apoptotic protein
NOXA. These findings revealed the detailed mechanism
for proliferation-inhibition effect of ROC1 knockdown
and suggested that ROC1 was an appealing drug target for
esophageal cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the leading causes
of cancer related death in the world and there are about
400,200 people died from EC in 2012 [1]. Esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a major histological
subtype among all types of the esophageal tumors,
especially in China [2]. Limitations of the traditional
chemotherapeutic treatment and an advanced stage at
the time of diagnosis account for the worse prognosis
of patients with ESCC [3–5]. It is necessary to identify
new anti-ESCC molecular targets and develop novel
therapeutic strategies to ameliorate its outcome.
Regulator of Cullins-1 (ROC1), also known as
RING box protein-1(RBX1), interacts with different
cullin family members, constitutes the catalytic cores and
activates CRL/SCF E3 ligases, which regulate different
biological process [6, 7]. Recently, ROC1 was reported
to be overexpressed in a number of cancers [8–11], which

five groups with increasing staining intensity from the
weakest (±, group 1) to the strongest (++++, group 5)
(Figure 1A). Statistical analysis demonstrated that ROC1
was overexpressed in ESCC tissues compared with their
corresponding adjacent normal tissues (Figure 1B), which
was confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Figure 1D).
Furthermore, the overexpression of ROC1 protein was
negatively correlated with 5-year overall survival rate of

Knockdown of ROC1 induces G2 cell cycle
arrest in esophageal cancer cells

Knockdown of ROC1 inhibits the proliferation
of esophageal cancer cells

To elucidate the mechanism of ROC1 knockdown
for cell growth inhibition, we firstly examined the cell
cycle profile of the ROC1-silencing cells. As shown in
Figure 3A, knockdown of ROC1 triggered G2/M cell
cycle arrest in both Kyse450 and TE1 cells. Furthermore,
ROC1 silencing induced significant accumulation of
WEE1, an inhibitor of G2-M phase transition [14], while
a decrease of p-H3, a hallmark of M phase cells [15],
indicating that ROC1-silencing cells were arrested at the
G2 phase (Figure 3B).

To further assess the role of ROC1 on cell
proliferation of esophageal cancer, ROC1 was knockdown
by two specific siRNA oligoes, named siROC1-1
and siROC1-2. Results showed that ROC1 silencing
significantly inhibited cell proliferation of both Kyse450
and TE1 cells (Figure 2A-2C). Besides, knockdown of
ROC1 also effectively inhibited the cell colony formation
in both cell lines (Figure 2D and 2E). The knockdown
efficiency of siRNA targeting ROC1 was confirmed by
Western blotting assay (Figure 2F and 2G).

Knockdown of ROC1 triggers apoptosis in
esophageal cancer cells
Next we examined whether apoptosis was also
responsible for the anti-proliferative effects of ROC1
silencing. Results showed that knockdown of ROC1 led to

NOXA plays a critical role for ROC1 silencinginduced apoptosis

a significant increase in Annexin V-positive cells (Figure
4A) and caspase-3-actived cells (Figure 4B). Similarly,
ROC1 silencing significantly induced the cleavage of
PARP and caspase-3 (Figure 4C). Furthermore, we found
that knockdown of ROC1 led to the loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential (∆Ψm) (Figure 5A), a classical marker
of the activation of intrinsic apoptosis, which suggested
that knockdown of ROC1 triggered mitochondrial
apoptosis.

To explore the potential mechanism of apoptosis, we
investigated systematically the effect of ROC1 knockdown
on the expression of the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic
proteins. Among these proteins, pro-apoptotic protein
NOXA was significantly up-regulated in both cell lines

(Figure 5B), suggesting that NOXA may be a critical
mediator for ROC1-silencing-mediated apoptosis.
To further define the role of NOXA in ROC1silencing-induced apoptosis, the expression of NOXA
was down-regulated by siRNA in ROC1-silencing cells.
NOXA knockdown significantly reduced the induction of
apoptosis (Figure 6A) and the cleavage of PARP in ROC1silencing cells (Figure 6B). These findings highlighted
a pivotal role of NOXA in ROC1-silencing-induced
apoptosis.

suppressed tumor growth over time while control tumors
grew rapidly, as revealed by the tumor growth curve
(Figure 7A, **P<0.01), tumor size (Figure 7B, top panel)
and tumor weight analysis (Figure 7B, bottom panel,
**P<0.01). Moreover, we further examined whether
NOXA and apoptosis were activated in vivo. As shown in
Figure 7C, ROC1 was effectively downregulated and the
expression of NOXA and cleaved PARP were significantly
induced upon ROC1 silencing. These observations
indicated that ROC1 silencing inhibited esophageal tumor
growth both in vitro and in vivo by accumulating the
expression of NOXA.

DISCUSSION

DMSO or CDDP after siROC1 transfection. Results
showed that ROC1 silencing significantly enhanced the
cytotoxity of CDDP and inhibited cell viability (Figure
8A). Moreover, knockdown of ROC1 significantly
enhanced CDDP-induced apoptosis, which is evident by
the increased expression of cleaved-PARP (Figure 8B).

Despite the improvement in the therapy for ESCC,
the prognosis remains poor and the 5-year survival rate
remains lower than 25% [16]. Diagnosis at advanced
stage and resistance to chemotherapy still persecute the
refractory disease [4]. Therefore, it is urgent to find new
therapeutic target.

Recently, some reports showed that ROC1 is
overexpressed in multiple human tumors and contributed
to the tumor progression [8–12]. RBX1/ROC1 disruption
results in early embryonic lethality [13, 17], cancer cell
death [11, 17] or the inhibition of tumor cell migration
[18]. In the present study, we revealed that ROC1
was hyperexpressed in esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma tissues compared to adjacent tissues, and the
overexpression of ROC1 was negatively associated with
5-year survival rate of the patients, indicating that ROC1
may play an important role in tumor progression of ESCC.
Moreover, knockdown of ROC1 significantly inhibited
cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and enhanced the
cytotoxity of CDDP to ESCC cells. These results indicate
that ROC1 serves as an attractive anti-ESCC target.

Previous reports showed that knockdown of ROC1
destroy CRL/SCF complexes and thus disrupt CRL/SCF
E3 ligase activity. As a result, a trail of CRL substrate were
accumulated and thus triggered DNA damage response
[19], lead to G2-M cell cycle arrest [11, 19], senescence
[11, 12], apoptosis [11] or protective autophagy [12]
in a cancer cell-specific manner. In terms of apoptosis
induction, Jia’s finding showed that proapoptotic protein
PUMA are involved in RBX1 (ROC1) silencing-induced
apoptosis [11], whereas NOXA is associated with RBX2
silencing [20]. Here we found that knockdown of ROC1
led to the accumulation of NOXA and NOXA knockdown
afforded significant protection against apoptosis, implying
that NOXA also play an important role in ROC1 silencinginduced apoptosis for ESCC cells.

NOXA has been proven as a particularly relevant
therapeutic target for several tumors, such as chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [21, 22], liver cancer [23],
lung cancer [24] and ESCC [25]. As a member of the BH3only proteins, NOXA triggered apoptosis at mitochondria
or the endoplasmic reticulum [26], which has an important
role for apoptosis induction by cytotoxic drugs, including

ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) inhibitors [27–32].
Administration of bortezomib significantly increases the
expression of NOXA in human melanoma cell grown and
inhibits tumor growth [29, 31]. NOXA is an important
mediator of bortezomib-induced apoptosis in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia cells [27]. Treatment ESCC or

cell-type-specific manner to induce cell apoptosis [25,
33]. These studies suggest that NOXA perhaps play an
important role in ROC1 silencing-induced apoptosis in
esophageal cancer cells.
In summary, our study provides the first piece of
appealing evidence supporting the notion that ROC1 is an
attractive target for ESCC cancer as well as serves as a
potential prognosis marker.
