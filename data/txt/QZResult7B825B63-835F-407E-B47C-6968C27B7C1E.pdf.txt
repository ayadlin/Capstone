BACKGROUND. The North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) conducted a
phase 2 study to evaluate the antitumor activity of the combination of gemcitabine and epirubicin in patients with pleural mesothelioma who received no more
than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen.
METHODS. A total of 23 patients were accrued between August 2001 and April
2002 and received gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 intravenously over 30
minutes weekly every 2 weeks and epirubicin at a dose of 90 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 on an every-21-days cycle (high-dose patient group). Between
August 2002 and April 2004, an additional 45 patients were treated at a reduced
dose of gemcitabine of 750 mg/m2 and epirubicin at a dose of 70 mg/m2 with
the same schedule (low-dose patient group).
RESULTS. In the high-dose patient group, the confirmed response rate was 13% (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 3–34%). The median survival was 9.3 months (95% CI,
7.4–10.7 months) and the median time to disease progression was 6.3 months (95%
CI, 3.0–7.6 months). In the low-dose patient group, the confirmed response rate was
7% (95% CI, 0–28%). The median survival was 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.7–8.7 months)
and the median time to disease progression was 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.7–5.6
months). Toxicity was moderate to severe. In the high-doseand low-dose groups,
87% and 60% of patients, respectively, experienced at least 1 adverse event of grade 4
or higher (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version
2.0]). The quality of life remained similar from baseline to the end of the 2 cycles of
treatment in the high-dose group but worsened in the low-dose group.
CONCLUSIONS. In the current study, the combination regimen of gemcitabine and
epirubicin was found to demonstrate minimal antitumor activity against pleural
mesothelioma. Cancer 2008;112:1772–9.  2008 American Cancer Society.

Chemotherapy For Pleural Mesothelioma/Okuno et al.

M

alignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is relentlessly progressive tumor whose incidence is
expected to continue to increase within the next decade because of exposure to asbestos.1,2 The treatment for MPM is largely palliative, with some centers
reporting long-term survivors with the use of aggressive multimodality therapy including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.3–7 However, despite these
reports, the majority of patients die of MPM, with respiratory failure and cachexia.
Several phase 2 studies using the combination of
cisplatin and gemcitabine have demonstrated response rates to systemic chemotherapy of 16% to
48%, with a median survival of 9.4 to 11.2 months.8–10
In addition, the anthracycline derivative epirubicin
has been studied in patients with MPM, with a single-agent response rate of 15% and a median survival
of 40 weeks.11 When given in combination with cisplatin, the response rate was reported to be 19%,
with a median survival of 13.3 months.12 There is
preclinical evidence of cytotoxic synergy between
gemcitabine and epirubicin.13
Patients with MPM often experience symptoms.
To our knowledge, there currently are no standard
quality-of-life (QOL) instruments for patients with
MPM, and we planned to use the simple Uniscale14,15 and Symptom Distress Scale (SDS)16 to gain
more information regarding QOL in patients undergoing chemotherapy for MPM.
We conducted a phase 2 study of the combination of gemcitabine and epirubicin in the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) to determine
the antitumor activity of this regimen in patients
with MPM, as well as the QOL of patients receiving
this treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Patients were required to be at least age 18 years
with histologically confirmed MPM with measurable
disease; an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1500/
mL; a platelet count 100,000/mL; total bilirubin
1.53 the upper normal limit (UNL); aspartate aminotransferase 3 times the UNL; creatinine 1.5
times the UNL; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance score of 0, 1, or 2; cardiac left ventricular function of 50%; 1 prior
chemotherapy regimen for MPM; a life expectancy of
12 weeks; and the ability to provide informed consent. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant;
had uncontrolled infections; reported prior treatment
with gemcitabine or anthracyclines; had a New York
Heart Association classification of III or IV; had any

1773

other severe underlying disease; had any prior malignancy except for adequately treated basal cell or
squamous cell skin cancer, adequately treated noninvasive carcinoma, or other cancer from which the
patient had been free of disease for at least 5 years;
or peripheral neuropathy grade 2. The study was
approved by the institutional review boards of the respective institutions, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Treatment Plan
The initial treatment plan was to use a gemcitabine
dose of 1000 mg/m2 and an epirubicin dose of 90
mg/m2. Because of high toxicity rates at the initial
starting dose (high-dose group), the study was modified and patients were treated at a lower dose of
chemotherapy (low-dose group). Between August
2001 and April 2002, patients in the high-dose group
received gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 given
intravenously on Days 1 and 8 and epirubicin at a
dose of 90 mg/m2 given intravenously on Day 1.
Cycles were repeated every 21 days for a maximum
of 6 cycles. Because of significant toxicity, between
August 2002 and April 2004, doses were modified to
the low dose of gemcitabine of 750 mg/m2 and epirubicin at a dose of 70 mg/m2. The use of colonystimulating factors was allowed as per American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines.
Dose Modifications
Patients with an interval ANC <500/mL for 3
days, febrile neutropenia, or a platelet count
<25,000/mL or any grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic
toxicity (with the exception of alopecia, nausea,
and vomiting) had the subsequent dose of both
agents reduced by 25%. Patient doses were withheld on Day 1 if the ANC was <1500/mL and the
platelet count was <100,000/mL. If these counts
had not recovered by 2 weeks, the patient was
taken off the study. On Day 8, gemcitabine was
decreased by 20% if an ANC of 1000 to 1500/mL
and a platelet count of 75,000/mL were noted.
Gemcitabine was omitted on Day 8 if the ANC was
<1000/mL or the platelet count was <75,000/mL.
Subsequently, the Day 1 dose of gemcitabine was
decreased 20% or based on interval adverse events,
whichever reduction was greater. For any grade 3
or 4 cardiac ischemia/infarction or cardiac left ventricular function (grade 2–4), patients were taken
off the study.
Response and Toxicity Criteria
Patients were evaluated for disease response every 2
cycles of chemotherapy, and then every 3 months to
6 months during observation. Tumor response was

1774

CANCER

assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) criteria17 and toxicities were
assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0).18

Patient Report Measures
The Uniscale and SDS were administered to each
patient at the beginning of therapy, before the third
treatment cycle, at the first 3-month visit during observation, and then at 1 year of follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of the current trial was to
evaluate the confirmed tumor response rate of this
2-drug regimen. Confirmed tumor response is
defined as an objective tumor response (either a
complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) that
is sustained for at least 2 consecutive evaluations at
least 4 weeks apart. All eligible patients in whom
treatment was initiated were considered evaluable
for estimating the confirmed tumor response rate. A
2-stage, 3-outcome, phase 2 study design19 was used
for the cohort of patients treated at a starting dose of
1000 mg/m2 of gemcitabine and 90 mg/m2 of epirubicin (high-dose group) to test whether there was
sufficient evidence to determine whether the confirmed response rate was at least 25% (ie, clinically
promising) versus at most 10% (ie, clinically inactive). The current study had an 80% power to detect
a confirmed response rate of 25%, with a .04 level of
significance. In addition, this study had a 10%
chance of determining that this study was inconclusive, if the true confirmed response rate was 25%.
Because of toxicity issues, after the first 23 patients
were enrolled to the high-dose group, it was decided
to start the study over with the low-dose group (in
which 750 mg/m2 of gemcitabine and 70 mg/m2 of
epirubicin were administered) using the same 2stage, 3-outcome, phase 2 study design as in the
high-dose group.
An interim analysis was to be performed after
the first 15 evaluable patients were enrolled. If 1
confirmed responses were observed in this initial
cohort, further accrual to the trial would be abandoned. If 2 confirmed tumor responses were
observed, the trial would proceed to the full accrual of 41 patients. After 41 evaluable patients
were accrued, the decision criteria used at the final
analysis were as follows: 5 confirmed responses
would yield a conclusion of ‘‘Not Promising’’ and 6
or 7 confirmed responses would provide an ‘‘Inconclusive’’ result that would require using 1-year survival rates, toxicity, and QOL results, in addition to
the confirmed response data, to assess whether

this regimen should be tested further. Finally, at
least 8 confirmed responses would be considered
adequate evidence of promising activity, and would
warrant further testing of this regimen in subsequent studies. A 95% confidence interval (95% CI)
for the confirmed tumor response rate was calculated using the method of Duffy and Santner20 and
any patient enrolled past the 41st patient was
included in the second stage of accrual for this calculation.
Secondary endpoints included adverse events,
duration of response, time to disease progression,
overall survival, and QOL. Adverse events were summarized in a tabular manner as the maximum grade
for a given type of event for each patient. The commonly occurring grade 31 adverse events (regardless
of attribution) are reported. Kaplan-Meier methodology21 was used to describe the distribution of time to
disease progression and survival.
QOL was assessed using the Uniscale and SDS
tools. All the QOL scores were translated into percentages (0–100) representing the relative position
of an individual along the theoretic dimension specified by the QOL instrument, in which the higher
the QOL score the better. A global SDS score was
calculated for each patient by taking the average of
their nonmissing individual SDS subscales. Simple
summary statistics (eg, mean and standard deviation) were used to explore changes in the QOL over
time. Normality testing via the Shapiro-Wilk22 procedure was used to determine whether parametric
or nonparametric procedures would form the basis
for analysis (Student t test for paired data or Wilcoxon signed rank tests). P values <.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All analyses
were conducted using SAS software (versions 8.0
and 9.0; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Adjustments
to statistical tests were not made for multiple comparisons.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
High-dose patient group
Between August 2001 and April 2002, 23 patients
were enrolled through the NCCTG. Twenty-two of
the patients (96%) were men and the median age
was 71 years (range, 60–83 years). Three patients

* Patients who did not receive treatment were excluded.

Low-dose patient group
Between August 2002 and April 2004, 45 patients
were enrolled through the NCCTG, excluding 1
patient who withdrew before receiving the study
treatment. Thirty-five of the patients (78%) were men
and the median age was 67 years (range, 38–85
years). Nine patients (20%) received prior chemotherapy, in which 5 patients received pemetrexed and
cisplatin, 1 received pemetrexed alone, 1 received
vinorelbine and carboplatin, 1 received paclitaxel
and carboplatin, and 1 received tetrahlomolybdate.
The majority of the patients (87%) had an ECOG performance score of 0 or 1. See Table 1 for all the
patient characteristics.

Outcome Measures
High-dose patient group
All 23 patients were evaluable for response and timeto-event endpoints. The confirmed response rate was
13% (95% CI, 3–34%), which consisted of 3 PRs and
0 CRs. At the time of last follow-up, all these responders had developed disease progression or died, with
a median duration of response of 8.0 months (range,
6.1–8.8 months). Two of these responders had an
epithelioid histology, whereas the other responder
had sarcomatoid histology. At the time of last followup, 22 patients had developed disease progression
and all 23 had died. The median survival (Fig. 1) was
9.3 months (95% CI, 7.4–10.7 months) and the median time to disease progression (Fig. 2) was 6.3
months (95% CI, 3.0–7.6 months). Chemotherapy-naive patients and those who had received 1 prior
chemotherapy regimen were found to have similar
outcomes with regard to response, survival, and disease progression (data not shown).
Low-dose patient group
A total of 41 patients were evaluable for response
and time-to-event endpoints (excluding 1 patient
who cancelled before receiving any study treatment
and 4 patients who did receive study treatment but

1776

CANCER

were found to be ineligible because the treating site
did not submit the diagnostic slides to confirm their
disease). The confirmed response rate was 7% (95%
CI, 0–28%), which consisted of 3 PRs and 0 CRs. This
confirmed response rate did not meet our predefined
criteria for success. One of the PRs occurred during
the observation phase, after the completion of all
treatment. All these responders subsequently developed disease progression, with a median duration of
response of 6.2 months (range, 3.6–6.8 months). Two
of these responders had an epithelioid histology,
whereas the other responder had a mixed histology.
At the time of last follow-up, 38 patients had developed disease progression and 37 had died. The median follow-up for the 4 patients still alive at the
time of last follow-up was 13.1 months (range, 12.6–
35.8 months). The median survival (Fig. 1) was 5.7
months (95% CI, 4.7–8.7 months) and the median
time to disease progression (Fig. 2) was 4.2 months
(95% CI, 2.7–5.6 months). Chemotherapy-naive
patients and those who had received 1 prior chemotherapy regimen had similar outcomes with regard to
response, survival, and disease progression (data not
shown).
As an exploratory secondary analysis, we did not
detect a statistically significant difference between
the 2 dosage groups with regard to overall survival
(log-rank P value of .18), time to disease progression
(log-rank P value of .12), or response (Fisher exact
test P value of .66), although there is preliminary evidence that the high-dose regimen may have greater
overall efficacy.

Dose Intensity
High-dose patient group
On average, patients (excluding cancellations) completed a median of 4 cycles of treatment (range, 1–6
cycles). No patients remained in active treatment at
the time of last follow-up. A majority of patients (8
of 23 patients; 35%) completed the treatment per
protocol, whereas the remainder discontinued therapy because of disease progression (7 patients), refusal (3 patients), adverse events (2 patients), other
medical problems (1 patient), physician discretion (1
patient), or alternative treatment (1 patient). The majority of patients received the full dose of treatment
for both agents for each of the first 6 cycles of treatment.
Low-dose patient group
On average, patients (excluding cancellations) completed a median of 4 cycles of treatment (range, 1–6
cycles). No patients remained in active treatment at
the time of last follow-up. A majority of patients

experienced at least 1 grade 41 adverse event. One
patient had a grade 5 capillary leak syndrome that
occurred during observation and was believed to be
unlikely to be related to study treatment. Common
grade 4 adverse events consisted of neutropenia
(78% of patients) and leukopenia (52% of patients).

In addition, 11 patients (48%) had at least 1 grade 3
thrombocytopenic event. Common grade 3 nonhematologic events included dyspnea (30% of patients),
febrile neutropenia (17% of patients), fatigue (17% of
patients), arrhythmia (13% of patients), and stomatitis (13% of patients). One of each of the following
grade 4 nonhematologic events was observed as well:
epistaxis, muscle weakness, cerebral ischemia, confusion, personality change, and adult respiratory distress syndrome.

Low-dose patient group
A total of 45 patients were evaluable for adverse
events (Table 3). Forty patients (89%) experienced at
least 1 grade 31 adverse event. Twenty-seven
patients (60%) experienced at least 1 grade 41

enced a grade 5 event including pneumonitis (possibly related to study treatment), cardiac ischemia/
infarction (not related to study treatment), and cardiac arrest (not related to study treatment). Common
severe hematologic events and nonhematologic
events are presented in Tables 2 and 3.
The high-dose group had significantly increased
rates of grade 3 and 4 hematologic adverse events
compared with the low-dose group (P < .01), but had
similar rates of grade 31 and grade 41 nonhematologic adverse events (P  .41 and P 5 1.00, respectively). Overall, the high-dose group had a significantly
increased rate of grade 41 adverse events compared
with the low-dose group (87% vs 60%; Fisher exact
P value of .03), but had a similar rate of grade 31
adverse events (P 5 .16) (Table 4).

Quality of Life
High-dose patient group
Eleven patients completed QOL forms at baseline
and also filled out another QOL form within 10 days
of the third cycle of treatment (Table 5). The global
QOL scores (SDS and Uniscale) remained similar
from baseline to the evaluation that was completed
before the third cycle of treatment. Within the SDS
scale, some of the items were found to be of borderline significance. These included the regularity of
nausea, which worsened from baseline (P 5 .06);
appetite, which improved from baseline (P 5 .06);
the regularity of pain, which improved from baseline
(P 5 .06); appearance, which worsened from baseline
(P 5 .09); and finally, breathing, which improved
from baseline (P 5 .05).
Low-dose patient group
A total of 21 patients completed QOL forms at baseline and also filled out another QOL form within 10
days of the third cycle of treatment (Table 5). The
global QOL scores (SDS and Uniscale) remained sim-

ilar from baseline to the evaluation completed before

Within the SDS scale, some of the items were either found to be significant or of borderline importance. These included the regularity of nausea, which
worsened from baseline (P 5 .03); appetite, which
worsened from baseline (P 5 .06); and finally, fatigue,
which worsened from baseline (P 5 .03).

DISCUSSION
The combination regimen of gemcitabine and epirubicin was selected based on its single-agent clinical
activity against MPM.23 The initial dose used in the
current study was based on phase 1 studies of gemcitabine and epirubicin.24,25 Because of significant
myelosuppression observed in the first 23 patients
enrolled, the study was modified to a lower dose, for
which 45 patients were studied. Despite the high rate
of hematologic toxicity noted within the high-dose
group, the QOL remained similar from baseline to
the end of Cycle 2, with no changes noted in global
QOL and very few borderline changes noted in the
SDS items. Within the low-dose group, the overall
QOL was found to be similar from baseline to the
end of the second cycle, but a few SDS items were

found to significantly worsen over time (eg, regularity
of nausea and fatigue).
The high-dose regimen of gemcitabine and epirubicin had a confirmed response rate, median duration of response, median overall survival, and
median time to disease progression that were comparable to other combination regimens,10,12,22,23,26,27
but was found to have significant hematologic toxicity. Although the low-dose regimen had better hematologic toxicity, it was not found to have significant
clinical activity against MPM. Should the higher dose
of gemcitabine and epirubicin be recommended for
clinical use? With many similar active regimens with
less toxicity currently available,8,9,22 the routine use
of this regimen at either the high or low dose is not
recommended and newer agents should be explored
in clinical trials.
