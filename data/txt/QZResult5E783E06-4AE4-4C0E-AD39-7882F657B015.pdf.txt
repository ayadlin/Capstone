Abstract
We and others have reported that C-28 methyl ester of 2cyano-3, 12-dioxoolen-1, 9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me) effectively inhibits the growth of multiple cancer cell types. Our
previous studies indicated that prolonged CDDO-Me treatment inactivated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in acute myelogenous leukemia cells. Whether treatment
with CDDO-Me has an earlier effect on other proteins that are
important for either signal transduction or oncogenesis is
unknown. Constitutively activated signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is frequently found in
human breast cancer samples. Constitutively activated STAT3
was shown to up-regulate c-Myc in several types of cancer and
has a feedback effect on Src and Akt. To examine the effects of
CDDO-Me on STAT3 signaling in breast cancer, we used the
murine 4T1 breast tumor model, which is largely resistant to
chemotherapy. In vitro, after treatment of 4T1 cells with 500
nmol/L CDDO-Me for 2 h, we found (a) inactivation of STAT3,
(b) inactivation of Src and Akt, (c) 4-fold reduction of c-Myc
mRNA levels, (d) accumulation of cells in G2-M cell cycle
phase, (e) abrogation of invasive growth of 4T1 cells, and ( f )
lack of apoptosis induction. In in vivo studies, CDDO-Me
completely eliminated 4T1 breast cancer growth and lung
metastases induced by 4T1 cells in mice when treatment
started 1 day after tumor implantation and significantly
inhibited tumor growth when started after 5 days. In vivo
studies also indicated that splenic mature dendritic cells were
restored after CDDO-Me treatment. In summary, these data
suggest that CDDO-Me may have therapeutic potential in
breast cancer therapy, in part, through inactivation of STAT3.

Introduction
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has
frequently been found in human breast cancer samples (1). STAT3mediated up-regulation of c-Myc levels was proposed to be one of
the important mediators of STAT3 oncogenesis (2). c-Myc is a
potent oncoprotein that has been found to play a critical role

in tumorigenesis (3). The use of an inducible c-Myc model
showed tumor growth or suppression, respectively, by controlling
c-Myc expression in a murine hepatocarcinoma model (4). Our
previous studies and that of others have shown that c-Myc
expression is regulated by constitutive activation of STAT3 in
mouse breast cancer and other types of cancer cells (5–7). As
the immediate upstream regulator of STAT3, Src has been
considered to play an important role in breast carcinogenesis.
However, we found that Src can be inactivated by STAT3
knockdown in 4T1 cells (5). We have also shown that Akt can
be inactivated following STAT3 knockdown in 4T1 cells (5),
suggesting that STAT3 is required for maintaining the activation
status of Src and Akt. As a downstream target of Src, Akt plays
an important role in regulating antiapoptotic proteins and
proteins that regulate cell cycle progression (8). However, it is
unclear how these intracellular signal transduction proteins
interact with each other, and the biological consequences of
these interactions remain uncertain. Recent reports provided
convincing evidence that constitutively activated STAT3 in breast
cancer cells is associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity
(9) and that STAT3 activation in cancer cells may allow them to
evade host immune surveillance (10). In agreement with these
observations, we reported that knockdown of STAT3 completely
abolished breast tumor formation in an immunocompetent
mouse model (5).
The 4T1 cell line was originally derived from a spontaneous
mammary carcinoma in BALB/c mice (11). It has been reported
that 4T1 cells mimic the effects of human mammary carcinoma
in that morbidity is due to the outgrowth of spontaneous
micrometastatic tumor cells that migrate to distant organs
relatively early during primary tumor growth (12, 13) and are
notoriously chemoresistant (14). Therefore, 4T1-driven breast
cancer in BALB/c mice constitutes an appropriate in vivo system
for modeling human breast cancer with regard to tumor growth
and metastasis. As such, the 4T1/BALB/c mouse system also
provides a useful experimental model for exploring the biological
effects in mammary tumorigenesis and for studying the effects
of small molecules that target signal transduction pathways
in vivo.
2-Cyano-3, 12-dioxoolen-1, 9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) and its
derivative CDDO-Me are synthetic triterpenoids proven to be
effective agents in controlling cancer cell growth in preclinical
models of leukemias, multiple myeloma, lymphomas, and solid
tumors, such as breast, pancreatic, and colon cancer (15–18).
CDDO-Me has been shown by us to (a) promote apoptosis in
several leukemic cell lines, (b) induce proapoptotic Bax protein as a

prelude to caspase activation, and (c) suppress the activation of
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 with concomitant
inhibition of Bcl-2 phosphorylation (18). In the present study, we
intended to examine early changes induced by CDDO-Me in mouse
breast cancer cells. Our findings indicate that CDDO-Me effectively
inhibits STAT3 signaling, which contributes to profound antitumor
efficacy of this compound in the in vitro and in vivo models of
highly metastatic 4T1 breast cancer cells. These observations hence
highlight the novel mechanism of CDDO-Me activity in breast
cancer, which is potentially applicable to other types of tumors
driven by the activation of STAT3 signaling.

Materials and Methods
Cell line, antibodies, and reagents. The 4T1 cell line was obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Anti-phosphorylated TyrSTAT3 (phosphorylated Tyr705), anti-STAT3, anti-phosphorylated Src
(phosphorylated Tyr527), anti-Src, anti-phosphorylated Akt (phosphorylated
Ser473), and anti-c-Myc were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.;
33D1 and MHC class II antibodies were obtained from eBioscience; anti-hactin was obtained from Sigma Life Sciences. The Cell Invasion kit was
purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. Coelenterazine was obtained
from Biotium, Inc.; Trizol was purchased from Invitrogen, Inc. Primers for cMyc real-time PCR were purchased from Applied Biosystems, Inc. CDDO-Me
was provided by Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Animals. Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. and maintained in M. D. Anderson
conventional animal facility.
Construction of lentivirus for Renilla luciferase cDNA transduction.
The plasmid was created by inserting the 2-kb Renilla luciferase cDNA
fragment from the pMOD-LucSH plasmid (InvivoGen). The lentiviral gene
transfer vector pWIP/GFP was a generous gift from Dr. Didier Trono
(Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland). Lentivirus preparation, gene
transduction by lentiviral infection, and cell sorting were done as described
previously (5).
Western blotting. Western blotting was done as described previously (19).
Cell proliferation assay. rLu/GFP-tagged 4T1 cells were seeded into sixwell plates at a concentration of 5  105 per well in triplicate, and 500

nmol/L CDDO-Me was added to each well. The total viable cell number in
each well was determined using an automated analyzer (Vi-CELL, Beckman
Coulter, Inc.).
Cell cycle analysis and real-time PCR. Cell cycle analysis and real-time
PCR were carried out as described previously (20).
Matrix gel invasion assay. The matrix gel invasion assay was conducted
in matrix chambers according to the manufacturer’s guidelines; the Cell
Invasion kit was purchased from Chemicon International.
Mouse tumor formation assay. Various doses of 4T1/rLu/GFP cells
were injected into mice to establish the levels needed for tumor formation.
For the in vivo efficacy study, 7  103 of Renilla luciferase/GFP tagged 4T1
cells were injected into the mammary fat pads of 8-week-old female BALB/c
mice, and CDDO-Me treatment was initiated at either day 1 or day 5 after
tumor implantation. CDDO-Me at 200 Ag/mouse was given i.v. at 2-day
intervals. CDDO-Me was formulated in liposomes as described elsewhere
(15). Control mice were injected with empty liposomes as described
previously (15). Tumor formation at the inoculation site was monitored
using an In Vivo Imaging System 100 from Xenogen Corp.
Live animal imaging assay. Mice were injected i.p. with 20 Ag
coelenterazine and imaged using the Xenogen In Vivo Imaging System 100.
Intratumoral CDDO-Me measurements. The tumor samples were
placed in 1 mL methanol after being weighed. The samples were
homogenized and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants
containing CDDO-Me were saved, lyophilized, and further reconstituted
with 200 AL of 1:1 methanol/water. Samples were spun for 10 min at 13.2
relative centrifugal force, and CDDO-Me concentrations were determined
by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; ref. 15).
Histologic analysis. For the histologic analysis, breast tumor and lungs
from mice treated with/without CDDO-Me were excised and fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained
with H&E. The slides were analyzed under a Nikon Optiphot microscope
with a digital capture camera (Microscopy Documentation System 290,
Eastman Kodak).

Results
Renilla luciferase is stably expressed in 4T1 cells after
lentiviral infection. A lentivirus gene transfer plasmid was
constructed as indicated in Fig. 1A, in which Renilla luciferase

Figure 2. Effect of CDDO-Me on signal
transduction pathways in 4T1 cells. 4T1
cells were treated with 500 nmol/L
CDDO-Me for 2 h. Cells were then lysed,
and Western blot analysis was done.
A, phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3 ) was
inactivated after CDDO-Me treatment,
whereas total STAT3 remained
unchanged. In addition, phosphorylated
Src (p-Src ) and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt)
were decreased, whereas the total levels of
these two proteins were not affected.
B, c-Myc mRNA levels were analyzed after
treatment of 4T1 cells with 500 nmol/L
CDDO-Me for 2 h, and a 3.5-fold reduction
was observed in CDDO-Me–treated cells
(P < 0.001). The difference was significant.
C, knocking down STAT3 in 4T1 cells also
inactivated Src and Akt. In addition, the
expression of c-Myc was decreased.

and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were designed in a bicistronic
fashion, which allows GFP to function as the marker of gene
transduction. After a single exposure to the lentivirus that was
carrying cDNAs of Renilla luciferase and GFP, 4T1 cells expressed
both Renilla luciferase and GFP. As shown in Fig. 1B and C, 4T1
cells started expressing GFP 72 h after lentiviral infection.
Meanwhile, the cells were also expressing high levels of Renilla
luciferase (Fig. 1D). After fluorescence-activated cell sorting for
selection of GFP(+) cells, the population of Renilla luciferase
expressing 4T1 cells was enriched to >90% and used for further
studies after expansion.
CDDO-Me blocks 4T1 intracellular signal transduction
pathways. We previously showed that, as a major oncogenic
regulator, STAT3 was constitutively activated in 4T1 cells (5). In
this study, we first examined whether CDDO-Me had an effect on
constitutively activated STAT3. As shown in Fig. 2A, we found that
STAT3 activity was significantly inhibited by 500 nmol/L CDDO-Me

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

after 2 h, whereas total STAT3 levels remained unchanged. We also
examined the effect of CDDO-Me on Src and Akt. We found that
both Src and Akt were inactivated, but total Src and Akt levels were
not affected. We then examined effects of CDDO-Me on the mRNA
level of c-Myc, a known downstream target of STAT3. We found
that the level of c-Myc in treated cells was only one third of that in
untreated 4T1 cells (Fig. 2B). Using small interfering RNA (siRNA),
we observed similar effects, specifically which knocking down
STAT3 led to the inactivation of both Src and Akt and reduction of
the expression of c-Myc (Fig. 2C).
CDDO-Me does not induce apoptosis in 4T1 cells but blocks
cell proliferation in vitro. To determine the functional consequences of STAT3 inhibition by CDDO-Me, we examined the
ability of CDDO-Me to induce apoptosis and/or growth inhibition
in 4T1 cells in vitro. We observed no significant apoptosis induction
in 4T1 cells after CDDO-Me treatment as assessed by Annexin V
flow cytometry (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, no significant apoptosis was

detected even at higher doses of CDDO-Me after 6, 24, and 48 h (Fig.
3B; data not shown). However, we found that CDDO-Me completely
blocked cell growth at the 500 nmol/L dose level as indicated in
Fig. 3C. Therefore, we further analyzed the changes in cell cycle
distribution of 4T1 cells after treatment with 500 nmol/L CDDOMe. As indicated in Fig. 3D and E, 4T1 cells were blocked in G2-M
after treatment with CDDO-Me for 24 and 48 h. Rather
unexpectedly, when STAT3 was depleted in 4T1 cells using siRNA
technology, CDDO-Me induced a profound apoptotic response,
with no viable cells remaining at 48 h (Fig. 4F).
CDDO-Me inhibits invasion of 4T1 cells. It has been reported
that 4T1 cells are highly invasive, which reflects their metastatic
ability in vivo. To determine whether CDDO-Me can affect this
property of 4T1 cells, we used an in vitro matrix gel invasion assay

to evaluate effects on 4T1 cells in the presence of 500 nmol/L
CDDO-Me. As shown in Fig. 4, 500 Amol/L CDDO-Me virtually
abrogated the invasion of 4T1 in the assay.
Effect of CDDO-Me on 4T1 breast cancer growth and
metastasis in immunocompetent mice. It has been well
established that 4T1 cells generate aggressive primary breast
tumors and metastatic tumors in BALB/c immunocompetent mice
(21). To study the effect of CDDO-Me on breast tumor formation,
we first established the 4T1/rLu breast tumor model to prove that
4T1 cells expressing Renilla luciferase would not be rejected by the
host. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, the ability of 4T1/rLu cells to form
breast tumors was indistinguishable from those formed by parental
4T1 cells (5). We then examined the effect of CDDO-Me on the
ability of 4T1 cells to form tumors. CDDO-Me treatment was

flow cytometry. 4T1 cells did not undergo apoptosis when treated with 500 nmol/L CDDO-ME for up to 6 h. The control cells were treated with the same amount
of the solvent DMSO. B, dose-finding study indicates that CDDO-Me does not induce apoptosis in 4T1 cells even at 1,000 nmol/L for 6 h. A longer time treatment
was also conducted (up to 72 h). However, no significant apoptosis was observed (data did not show). C, CDDO-Me at 500 nmol/L blocks the growth of 4T1 cells.

murine 4T1 breast cancer model, CDDO-Me maintained the
mature dendritic cell population, which possibly contributed to
the potent antitumor and antimetastatic effect of this agent.

Discussion

Figure 4. CDDO-Me blocks invasion of 4T1 cells. 4T1 cells were serum starved
for 24 h before being seeded on the matrix gel well. FBS (10%) served as the
attractor for the cells. After 48 h of incubation, only 1  104 cells treated with
CDDO-Me had penetrated the gel, whereas 9.5  104 untreated control cells had
penetrated the gel (P < 0.001).

initiated 1 day after inoculation of mice with 4T1 breast tumor cells
(7  103 per mouse), at the dose of 200 Ag/mouse at 2-day intervals,
for a total of five injections. The results presented in Fig. 5B showed
that 4T1 breast tumor formation was completely inhibited by
CDDO-Me in five mice (Fig. 5B, right). In contrast, four mice
without CDDO-Me treatment developed aggressive breast tumors
at the injection site (Fig. 5B, left), which required sacrifice at 35
days. No tumors or tumor metastases were observed in CDDO-Me–
treated mice over a 90-day observation period, whereas numerous
metastatic tumors in the lung were observed in control animals
(Fig. 5C). In addition, the lungs from four untreated mice and from
five CDDO-Me–treated mice were analyzed histologically. The
results indicated that extensive (50%) metastatic lesions were seen
in lungs that were isolated from all four control mice, whereas no
metastasis was detected in lungs isolated from five CDDO-Me–
treated mice (Table 1; Fig. 6). These results show striking antitumor
and antimetastatic activity of CDDO-Me treatment in this
aggressive murine model of breast tumorigenesis.
Next, we extended our observations by delaying initiation of
CDDO-Me treatment from day 1 to day 5 after the breast tumor
inoculation. As shown in Fig. 5D, five control mice developed
aggressive breast tumors (Fig. 5D, left). In contrast, at day 30 after
tumor inoculation, breast tumors were significantly smaller in 10 of
15 CDDO-Me–treated mice in comparison with controls (P <
0.0001; Fig. 5E). Further, 5 of 15 mice were completely tumor-free
after CDDO-Me treatment for up to 95 days. CDDO-Me was given
only nine times at 2-day intervals (200 Ag/mouse). No significant
toxicity was observed in CDDO-Me–treated animals. We measured
intratumor CDDO-Me concentration from a total six tumor
samples, which averaged from 3.8 to 6.4 Amol/L (Table 2).
The effect of CDDO-Me on splenic mature dendritic cells. To
assess potential immunologic effects of CDDO-Me on tumor
growth, we analyzed mature dendritic cells isolated from the
spleens of control or CDDO-Me–treated tumor-bearing mice. As
shown in Fig. 7, the number of mature dendritic cells from
untreated tumor-bearing mice was two thirds lower than that from
normal mice (Fig. 7C). In contrast, the number of mature dendritic
cells in spleens from CDDO-Me–treated mice (Fig. 7B) was almost
identical to that of normal untreated control mice (Fig. 7A) without
tumors. These results suggest that, in the immunocompetent

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

Our results indicate that CDDO-Me effectively inhibits growth
and metastases of the aggressive mouse breast tumor cell line 4T1
both in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 3–7). Mechanistic studies showed
that CDDO-Me inactivated STAT3 in 4T1 cells after 2 h (Fig. 2A). In
our previous studies, we were able to show that CDDO-Me affected
ERK and other intracellular components 6 h after treatment (22).
Our present data suggest that STAT3 may be the earliest
intracellular target to be affected by CDDO-Me. To our knowledge,
this is the first report to show that CDDO-Me is capable of
inactivating STAT3.
Our investigations also showed that inhibition of phosphorylated
STAT3 by CDDO-Me was associated with inactivation of two other
potent oncoproteins, Src and Akt (Fig. 2A). The finding that STAT3
inactivation in breast cancer cells resulted in the inactivation of Src
and Akt is consistent with findings of our previous study (5), in
which knockdown of STAT3 led to the inactivation of Src and Akt
in 4T1 cells. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is associated
with the requirement of STAT3 in the complex formed by Src and
Akt. It is believed that STAT3 relocalizes from the cytoplasm into
the nucleus after the protein is phosphorylated (16). However,
phosphorylated STAT3 may also remain and function in the
cytoplasm, interacting with other signal transducers, such as Src
and Akt, and maintain their function. The mechanisms of the
activation of Src and Akt by phosphorylated STAT3 or by STAT3
remain largely unknown. Clearly, further studies are needed to
clarify this coactivation and its biological sequelae on breast
carcinogenesis.
In addition, we showed that CDDO-Me reduces c-Myc mRNA
levels. Overexpressed c-Myc has been reported in many types of
cancers and cancer cell lines, and the reduction of c-Myc has been
shown to suppress tumor growth in vivo (4). In our model, 4T1 cells
expressed a detectable amount of c-Myc, and the mRNA of c-Myc
was reduced 4-fold by 500 nmol/L CDDO-Me, suggesting that
CDDO-Me down-regulated c-Myc through the STAT3 pathway. In
parallel experiments, we observed similar results using siRNA
technology, whereby a depletion of STAT3 in 4T1 cells resulted in
the inactivation of Src, Akt, and c-Myc down-regulation (Fig. 2C).
Curiously, in STAT3-depleted 4T1 cells, CDDO-Me induced
profound apoptosis as shown in Fig. 3F, suggesting that either
(a) complete inactivation of STAT3 by combined CDDO-Me and
siRNA exposure is required for the execution of the apoptosis
program or (b) CDDO-Me has additional intracellular targets,
inactivation of which combined with STAT3 blockade causes
synergistic apoptotic response. Some of these targets have been
elucidated (e.g., nuclear factor-nB and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-g; refs. 23–25). Constitutively activated STAT3
has been widely reported to function as a potent oncoprotein for
human breast cancer (1, 21, 26). Clinical data indicate that a large
percentage of human breast cancer samples contain activated
STAT3 (1). It has been reported that STAT3 promotes the
expression of proteins that are directly involved in cancer cell
invasion and metastasis, such as glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3h and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP; refs. 28, 29). We here
provide evidence that CDDO-Me inactivates STAT3 and blocks
breast tumor metastases. The mechanisms of this antimetastatic

Figure 5. CDDO-Me blocks breast tumor growth. A, left, mice were inoculated with 4T1/rLu/GFP cells at the indicated dose, and tumors were visualized using
the Xenogen imaging system; right, breast tumors reached about 1.5 to 2.5 cm within 25 to 30 d of injection of 7  103 cells into the mammary gland fat pad.
B, mice were inoculated with 7  103 4T1/rLu/GFP cells in the mammary gland fat pad. The experimental group was treated with CDDO-Me beginning 1 d after the
tumor cell inoculation at the dose of 200 Ag/mouse, i.v. at 2-d intervals, for a total of five injections of CDDO-Me. Mice that received empty liposomes developed breast
tumors (left), whereas the CDDO-Me–treated mice did not develop tumors (right ). This image was taken on day 20 after the tumor cell inoculation. The treated
mice remained tumor-free at the end of the study period, which was 90 d after the tumor inoculation. C, metastatic lung tumors were observed in mice that did not
receive CDDO-Me (left), whereas the lung from CDDO-Me–treated mouse was tumor-free (right ). To assess the potential effects of CDDO-Me on established
breast tumors, we delayed the timing of treatment initiation from day 1 to day 5 after the tumor cell inoculation. D, left, all untreated mice developed aggressive breast
tumors, shown here on day 26 after tumor cell inoculation; right, in contrast, mice that received CDDO-Me (200 Ag/mouse, i.v. at 2-d intervals, for a total of eight
injections) developed smaller breast tumors or were completely tumor-free after the treatment. E, the difference between the treated and untreated groups was

effect of CDDO-Me require further investigation; GSK and MMPs
are potential candidate targets. In addition, cumulative evidence
indicates that constitutively activated STAT3 in cancer cells
prompts cancer cells to produce factors that impair the host
immune response to cancer cells, suggesting that constitutively
activated STAT3 plays an important role not only in cell
transformation but also in the interaction between cancer cells
and host immune cells (30, 31). A recent study indicated that
dendritic cell maturation was inhibited by breast cancer
development (9, 32). It has been documented that immature
dendritic cells suppressed by cancer cells further induce immune
tolerance to tumors. However, surgical removal of the tumor can

restore the maturation of dendritic cells (9). These findings
strongly suggest that the interactions between tumor and immune
cells are critically important in tumorigenesis. In our previous
study, abolishing STAT3 virtually eliminated the tumor-forming
ability of 4T1 cells in immunocompetent mice (5). The results of
the current study showed that 4T1 cells were unable to form
primary breast and lung metastatic tumors after CDDO-Me
treatment, suggesting that CDDO-Me–inactivated STAT3 in 4T1
cells may result in the inhibition of factors that impair dendritic
cell maturation, hence reversing immune tolerance to cancer
cells. In support of this hypothesis, splenic dendritic cell analysis
indicated that the number of mature dendritic cells in 4T1 breast

tumor-bearing mice was only one third of that in normal control
splenic tissue; in contrast, in CDDO-Me–treated and tumor-free
mice, the mature dendritic cell population was the same as in
normal control splenic tissue. These results in conjunction with our
previous studies suggest that breast tumors can be suppressed by

inactivating STAT3, in part, via restoration of dendritic cell

The antitumor efficacy of CDDO-Me has been extensively
investigated in several other studies (15, 18, 25, 33). In our murine

CDDO-Me Inhibits Breast Tumor by Inactivating STAT3

Figure 7. Dendritic cell maturation after
CDDO-Me treatment. The number of
mature dendritic cells was analyzed by
33D1 and MHC class II surface markers,
which represent the markers for mature
splenic dendritic cells in mice. Splenic
cells from (A ) normal healthy mice had
3.05 F 0.12% (n = 3) mature dendritic
cells, and those from (B ) CDDO-Me–
treated and breast tumor-free mice had
2.9 F 0.23% (n = 3) mature dendritic cells;
in contrast, only 1.02 F 0.09% (n = 3)
of splenic mature dendritic cells (DC )
were found in untreated and breast
tumor-bearing mice (C ) and the difference
of mature dendritic cells in spleen between
treated and untreated groups was
significant (P < 0.01; D ).

model, we observed no induction of tumor cell apoptosis by
CDDO-Me but complete inhibition of tumor cell growth, most
likely as a consequence of cell signaling and cycle blockade (Fig. 3).
Preclinical toxicity study results indicated that CDDO-Me is well
tolerated in monkeys and rodents. This finding is supported by our
study where no apparent toxicity was observed despite profound
antitumor effects. Notably, intratumor CDDO-Me concentrations
were above 3 Amol/L levels (Table 2), which by far exceeded
concentrations of CDDO-Me required for growth-inhibitory effects
in vitro, hence showing excellent tumor tissue accumulation of the
compound without obvious systemic toxicity.
To our knowledge, the results presented here are the first
evidence that CDDO-Me can inactivate STAT3 in breast cancer cells
and can abolish tumor development and metastasis in immunocompetent mice. These results have potential clinical implications
because STAT3 is an important target for breast cancer therapy and
because CDDO-Me would be an effective agent for inactivating
STAT3 and further inhibiting breast tumor growth in vivo. CDDO-

Me is currently in phase I clinical trial in patients with solid tumors
at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, and the results of our study
strongly suggest breast cancer patients as prime candidates for this
novel therapy. Because STAT3 plays an important role in
tumorigenesis in different tumor types, we propose that inactivation of STAT3 by CDDO-Me may have therapeutic benefit in other
tumors driven by the activation of STAT3 signaling.
