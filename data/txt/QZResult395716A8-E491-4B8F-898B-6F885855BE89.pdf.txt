ABSTRACT
Background: Neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma (NECC) is a rare and aggressive
subtype of cervical cancer. To date, no NECC cell-based model is available, which
hinders the development of new therapeutic strategies for NECC. In this study, we
derived a new NECC cell line from an ex vivo biopsy and used it to explore novel drug
combination approach for NECC.
Results: The stable HM-1 cell line displayed high expression levels of the
neuroendocrine marker, synaptophysin. HM-1 cell transplantation could induce
tumor growth in nude mice. As expected, the combination of etoposide and cisplatin
synergistically inhibited HM-1 cell proliferation. Strikingly, when etoposide and cisplatin
were combined with PI3K inhibitor BEZ235, the growth of HM-1 cells was significantly
reduced. Taken together, the data implied the combination of etoposide and cisplatin
with BEZ235 not only inhibited HM-1 cell proliferation but also increased cell apoptosis.
Materials and Methods: A NECC tissue sample from a 75-year-old female patient
was processed to derive a primary cell line annotated as HM-1. The features of HM-1
were analyzed to establish its characteristic profile. Next, HM-1 was treated with PI3K
inhibitors, BKM120 and/or BEZ235, in combination with two well-known genotoxic
drugs, etoposide and/or cisplatin, to evaluate which combination could serve as a
more effective treatment approach. Their inhibiting effects on HM-1 were evaluated
by cell viability, apoptosis, and target kinase expression.
Conclusions: The newly established NECC cell line HM-1 could serve as a cellbased model for NECC research. The synergistic drug combination of PI3K inhibitor
with genotoxic drugs might become a potential new treatment strategy against NECC.

INTRODUCTION

are squamous cell carcinoma (70%) and adenocarcinoma
(25%) [2]. In contrast, the neuroendocrine cervical
carcinoma (NECC) is a rare subtype of cervical cancer,
and accounts for only approximately 2% of all cervical
malignancies [3]. Moreover, NECC is aggressive and
metastasizes at high rate in clinical observations. The
5-year survival rate for NECC (35.7%) is much lower than

cancers contributing to female death worldwide. A

classification, the most common types of cervical cancer

squamous cell carcinoma (60.5%) and adenocarcinoma
(69.7%) combined [4].
Given the rare prevalence of NECC, there is a
limitation in the attempt to determine an optimal treatment.
Most published studies contain few patients, and there
are no completed prospective trials [5, 6]. Treatment
considerations are generally restricted by current options
for neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung [6]. Moreover,
the understanding of NECC has been limited by the lack of
appropriate cell lines. Therefore, establishing a new NECC
cell line shall provide a representative research system
to develop therapeutic applications for neuroendocrine
cervical carcinoma.
According to the treatment options recommended by
the Society of Gynecologic Oncology for neuroendocrine
tumors of the gynecologic tract, a combination etoposide
and cisplatin chemotherapy should be used for patients
at all stages of NECC [7]. These two genotoxic drugs
have been commonly used in combination to treat
various cancers, including adrenocortical cancer, small
cell lung cancer, germ cell tumors, and neuroendocrine
tumors [8, 9]. Etoposide is a genotoxic drug with
topoisomerase inhibitory activity and works by forming
a ternary complex with DNA and the topoisomerase
II enzyme, thus preventing re-ligation of the DNA
strands and inducing DNA damage [10]. Because cancer
cells divide more often than normal cells, etoposide
promotes cancer cell apoptosis by causing errors during
DNA synthesis [11]. Cisplatin is a platinum-containing
genotoxic drug that displays inhibitory activity against
a wide variety of solid tumors [12]. Cisplatin works
by forming irreversible crosslinks with DNA, which
ultimately leads to cell apoptosis. Although the etoposide
and cisplatin combination regimen has been recommended
for use against NECC, the mortality rate remains high [5].
Therefore, new treatment strategies against this aggressive
malignancy are still needed.
Target therapy research has been envisioned to yield
effective treatment options for patients who do not respond
favorably to standard therapy. Moreover, rare cancers that
have limited treatment options can potentially be treated
with specific targeted therapies under a precision approach
[13]. One example is targeting thePI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in cell
growth, differentiation, and apoptosis [14]. Dysregulation
of this pathway has been linked to the development
of several tumor types and to the pathogenesis of other
cancers [15, 16]. In neuroendocrine tumors, nearly all the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway components can be molecularly
altered, likely with one or more mutations. Thus, this
pathway has been listed as a potential drug target for
neuroendocrine tumors [17, 18]. Recently, Frumovitz et al.
found that PIK3CA, which encodes the p110α catalytic
subunit of PI3K, is the most common mutation found
in small cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer [19]. Other
reports also found that the PIK3CA gene is frequently
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

amplified in cervical cancers (68%). PIK3CA mutation
is also found in cancers of the endometrium (23%) and
ovary (8%) [20, 21]. A recent study showed that small
molecule PI3K inhibitors, BKM120 and BEZ235, could
effectively reduce cell proliferation and increase apoptosis
in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cells [22]. Therefore,
we investigated whether these two PI3K inhibitors
with/without genotoxic agents may display anti-NECC
efficacy and explored the feasibility of using the drugs in
combination as new treatment options for NECC patients.
In this study, we first established a new NECC
cell line to overcome the lack of a research model.
This NECC cell line was then used to investigate the
pathological characteristics of NECC for determining
potential treatment strategies. Combination treatment
with genotoxic drugs (etoposide and cisplatin) and a PI3K
inhibitor was evaluated for NECC cell growth inhibition
and apoptosis.

RESULTS
General characteristics of HM-1 cells derived
from human NECC: morphology, growth rate
and HPV infection
Cellular morphology of HM-1 was examined under
a phase contrast microscope (Figure 1A). HM-1 cells were
either bipolar or multipolar and displayed a fibroblastlike shape in culture. After reaching confluence, HM-1
had an elongated, spindle shape. Furthermore, HM-1 had
the tendency to lose contact inhibition upon prolonged
culturing.
We next investigated the growth rate of HM-1 cells
by cell doubling time assay (Figure 1B). After seeding
1 × 105 HM-1 cells in 6-cm petri dishes, the cells were
maintained and harvested every 24 hours for cell counting.
The result showed that the doubling time of HM-1 cells
was 35 hours in vitro. By using RT-PCR assay to detect
HPV infection in HM-1 cells (Supplementary Figure 1),
we found HM-1 expressed a positive match of HPV-16
infection. This result suggested a past HPV-16 infection
in HM-1. Authentication of HM-1 cells by STR DNA
Profiling was also performed (Supplementary Table 1) and
used for comparison and to check the identity against other
cell lines in the STR reference database (data not shown).

HM-1 cells expressed the neuroendocrine
marker synaptophysin (SYP) and expanded in
vivo via xenotransplantation
We next determined whether HM-1 expressed
the well-known neuroendocrine marker, synaptophysin
(SYP) [6, 23] by Western blot and immunocytochemistry
assay (Figure 2A–2B). In Western blot analysis, we used
the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and the cardiac
myoblast cell line H9C2 as the positive and negative
45324

controls, respectively. The result indicated that HM-1 cells
evidently expressed SYP. The immunocytochemistry assay
likewise confirmed the SYP expression in HM-1 cells, and
the expression pattern supported the abundant presence of
SYP in the vesicles. Cell block staining also showed that
HM-1 cells positively expressed SYP (Figure 2C) and
the neural cell adhesion molecule protein CD56 protein
(Figure 2D). Taken together, these data validated the
neuroendocrine lineage of HM-1 cells.
To investigate the in vivo tumorigenicity of HM-1
cells, we inoculated 5 × 106 HM-1 cells subcutaneously
into the back of BALB/c female nude mice and monitored
the growth of tumors. A growth curve of HM-1 showed
the tumor volume increased progressively during the first
month after transplantation (Figure 2E). We estimated
the in vivo tumor volume doubling time of HM-1 to be
approximately 13 days. These ﬁndings demonstrated that
HM-1 was a neuroendocrine tumor with carcinogenicity
in vivo.

According to the treatment options recommended by
the Society of Gynecologic Oncology for neuroendocrine
tumors of the gynecologic tract, a combination
chemotherapy of etoposide and cisplatin should be
used for patients at all stages of NECC [7]. Therefore,
we investigated the combined anti-cancer efficacy of
etoposide and cisplatin (EP) on HM-1 (Figure 3B). The
experimental HM-1 cell group was treated for 72 hours
with a combination of etoposide and cisplatin, using
a 1-to-1 ratio at their IC50 concentrations (calculated
from data shown in Figure 3A). The results showed
this combination had a much stronger inhibitory effect
on HM-1 cells. Specifically, the double-drug treatment
reduced cell viability compared to the single-drug
treatments from 51%~53.7% to 14.6%. To verify
the synergistic effect of the etoposide and cisplatin
combination, we also performed another set of assays at
the halved IC50 (IC50/2) condition. We found even though
the co-treatment concentration was reduced by half, the
cell viability could still be dropped to 28.6% compared
with single-drug treatments. Consistent with previous
clinical reports, these results indicated that the etoposide
and cisplatin combination was effective in killing HM-1
in vitro and supported the application of such a drug
combination for treating NECC.

Combination of etoposide and cisplatin
effectively inhibited the growth of NECC
To evaluate the sensitivity of HM-1 to the current
NECC chemotherapy drugs, two FDA approved agents,
etoposide (topoisomerase II inhibitor) and cisplatin
(alkylating agent), were selected for this experiment.
The drug concentrations ranged from 0 to 106 nM, and
the exposure time was 72 hours (Figure 3A). Due to the
50% growth-inhibitory (IC50) variability of etoposide and
cisplatin in each repeat at different drug concentrations,
the range of IC50 values on HM-1 were selected to be 8.2–
21.5 × 104 nM for etoposide, and 7.3–9.8 × 103 nM for
cisplatin. We found both agents could effectively reduce
HM-1 cell viability at concentrations higher than 103 nM.
Moreover, the data suggested that cisplatin had a higher
inhibition efficacy on HM-1 cell viability.

PI3K inhibition decreased HM-1 cell
proliferation
To explore alternative drugs and drug combinations
that could be more effective for treating NECC, we
evaluated the anti-cancer efficacy of PI3K inhibitors on
HM-1. HM-1 cells were treated with two PI3K inhibitors:
BKM120 and BEZ235 at different concentrations.
Cell numbers were determined at 72 hours after each
treatment (Figure 4A). We found HM-1 cell numbers
were significantly reduced at all doses in the BKM120

and BEZ235 groups compared with the no-treatment
control and DMSO groups. To determine whether the
PI3K downstream signaling pathway was suppressed by
BKM120 and BEZ235, we harvested the HM-1 lysates and
analyzed the status of Akt and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by
Western blot (Figure 4B). We found that with increasing
doses of BKM120, the phosphorylation level of Akt
gradually decreased. Similarly, treatment with increasing
concentrations of BEZ235 also reduced the phosphorylated
Akt level but at a much lower concentration of inhibitor. In
addition, the phosphorylated form of another downstream
regulatory protein 4E-BP1 showed a dose-dependent
reduction under BKM120 treatment. On the other hand,
the phosphorylated 4E-BP1 was completely eliminated in
the presence of BEZ235, which suggested that BEZ235
caused an effective down-regulation of p4E-BP1 in HM-1.
We also performed viability assay to examine the effects
of PI3K inhibitors on HM-1 (Figure 4C). As expected,
treatment with various concentrations of BKM120 and
BEZ235 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of
HM-1 cell viability.

inhibitors mechanisms of action toward HM-1 was
associated with cell apoptosis and DNA damage. For this
experiment, we performed apoptotic marker caspase-3
activation analysis by flow cytometry (Figure 5A).
After treating HM-1 with various doses of BKM120
and BEZ235, the mean values of caspase-3 fluorescence
intensity were significantly increased as shown by the
widening base of signals moving toward the right.
Furthermore, the quantitative and statistical illustrations of
the cytometric histograms showed each PI3K inhibitor had
a dose-dependent increase of activated caspase-3 compared
with the control and DMSO groups. To further analyze this
apoptotic effect, HM-1 cells were treated with each PI3K
inhibitor at three different concentrations for 24 hours
before DNA fragmentation analysis (Figure 5B). Consistent
with earlier findings, DNA fragmentation was effectively
induced by ≥ 2.5 μM of BKM120 or ≥ 100 nM of BEZ235.

The triple-drug combination of etoposide,
cisplatin and BEZ235 was the most effective in
suppressing HM-1 viability and increasing HM-1
apoptosis in vitro

PI3K inhibition resulted in an increase in HM-1
apoptosis and DNA damage

After confirming PI3K inhibitors were effective
anti-HM-1 agents, we next determined which drug
combination would have an anti-cancer response better
than the etoposide and cisplatin (EP) combination.

Because PI3K signaling is known to regulate cell
growth and survival, we evaluated whether the PI3K

DISCUSSION

Because it was evident that HM-1 was more sensitive to
BEZ235, we devised the following treatment options for
anti-HM-1 drug combination screening: three single-drug
treatments including etoposide only, cisplatin only, and
BEZ235 only; three double-drug combinations including
“etoposide + cisplatin”, “etoposide + BEZ235”, “cisplatin
+ BEZ235”; and “etoposide + cisplatin + BEZ235”. The
cell viability assay was examined at 72 hours after each
treatment (Figure 6A).
We found all treatment options could inhibit HM-1
cell viability. For single-drug treatments, the cell viability
rates were dropped to 36.4%~49.7%. The anti-cancer
effects could be further enhanced under the double-drug
combinations to the level of 10.0% to 22.1%. Interestingly,
HM-1 viability was signiﬁcantly reduced under the
“etoposide + cisplatin + BEZ235” triple-drug treatment
group, which resulted in a striking 2.4% cell viability
compared to the control.
We next measured the extent of DNA damage in
HM-1 in response to each treatment condition (Figure 6B).
The result showed that “etoposide + cisplatin” increased
the DNA fragmentation compared with either etoposide or
cisplatin alone or control group. Notably, the triple-drug
combination of “etoposide + cisplatin + BEZ235” resulted
in an even greater inhibition efficacy of HM-1, which was
demonstrated by the 23-fold enhancement compared with
the control group alone. These data implied the potential
of adapting a triple-drug combination to develop a novel
therapeutic strategy for NECC.

Limited by the rare occurrence of NECC,
previous studies have suggested that the establishment
of neuroendocrine tumor cell lines may facilitate the
understanding of neuroendocrine tumor biology and the
development of new therapeutic modalities [24, 25].
Hence, developing a representative NECC cell line is
important for advancing NECC research. In this study,
we successfully established a neuroendocrine cervical
carcinoma (NECC) cell line, HM-1, from a 75-year-old
female. This cell line was characterized by neuroendocrine
marker expression and carcinogenic properties. Further
analysis validated HM-1 as a novel, stable and tumorigenic
cell line that possesses the crucial characteristics of
neuroendocrine tumors and has the potential to serve as a
cell-based NECC research model.
To date, the combined etoposide and cisplatin
genotoxic regimen is a widely accepted chemotherapy
approach for treating NECC [7, 26–28]. In accordance
with this recommendation, our data also supported
that a combination of etoposide and cisplatin could
synergistically inhibit HM-1 cells compared with the
individual agents alone (Figure 3). To enhance the anticancer efficacy, we further explored new therapeutic
modalities for NECC. We hypothesized that by cotargeting the PI3K signaling transduction pathway, we
might observe better anti-cancer efficacy than the current
genotoxic drug combination [15]. We henceforth applied

Figure 3: Dose response curves of HM-1 cells to etoposide and cisplatin treatment. Two of the most common chemotherapeutic
drugs for NECC were tested: etoposide (a topoisomerase inhibitor) and cisplatin (an alkylating agent), by cell viability assay. (A) The 50%
growth-inhibitory concentration (IC50, nM) to each drug was 8.2–21.5 × 104 nM for etoposide, and 7.3–9.8 × 103 nM for cisplatin. (B) The
anti-cancer efficacy of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) in combination on HM-1 was significantly increased. The controls were untreated cells,
etoposide alone, and cisplatin alone. The etoposide and cisplatin combination with 1-to-1 ratio at IC50 performed better than each drug alone
and resulted in a cell viability of 14.6% as compared to the untreated control. Reducing the concentrations of both drugs by half could still
result in a cell survival rate of 28.6% comparted to the untreated control (*p < 0.05 vs. control; †p < 0.05 vs. single-drug treatment). The
data represented the mean ± SEM.

and found that PI3K inhibitors BKM120 and BEZ235
could significantly inhibit HM-1 cell proliferation
(Figure 4) and induce cell apoptosis (Figure 5). These
results indicated that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway might be involved in driving NECC progression.

The pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 has been shown to
have anti-cancer activity in preclinical models of various
solid tumors [29–31]. While favorable tolerability profiles
with common adverse events have been observed, BKM120
displayed modest clinical efficacy under a single-agent

Figure 4: PI3K inhibitors decreased cell proliferation rate and cell viability of HM-1 cells. HM-1 cells were seeded in

culture plates and treated with various doses of BKM120 (1, 2.5, or 5 μM) or BEZ235 (10, 100, or 1000 nM). (A) The cell numbers were
significantly decreased at all doses under either BKM120 or BEZ235 treatment (*p < 0.05 vs. control). (B) The Western blot analysis
showed the levels of PI3K signaling downstream proteins, pAkt and p4E-BP1, were significantly reduced with increasing concentrations of
either inhibitor. GAPDH was the loading control. (C) The cell viability (%) determined by MTT/WST-1 assay was significantly reduced at
all concentrations for either BKM120 or BEZ235 (*p < 0.05 vs. control). The data represented the mean ± SEM.

regimen in early clinical trials [32]. BEZ235 is a PI3K and
mTOR dual-specificity inhibitor that simultaneously targets
the ATP binding sites of PI3K and mTOR [33]. BEZ235 has
been shown to possess favorable pharmaceutical properties
in preclinical studies [34, 35]. Strikingly, we noticed that
BEZ235 could effectively kill HM-1 cells at a much lower
concentration than that of BKM120. Such variation in
chemo-sensitivity has also been observed in breast cancer
cells [36], lymphoma cells [37] and leiomyosarcoma
cells [38]. Thus, BEZ235 was selected for subsequent
assessments in a drug combination screen.
As mentioned above, multimodality therapy of
etoposide/cisplatin is the recommended approach for
treating NECC [28]. Based on this, we analyzed the
combined effects of etoposide/BEZ235 and cisplatin/
BEZ235 for their anti-HM-1 activities. We found
that the combination of cisplatin and BEZ235 shared
similar inhibitory effects on HM-1 viability with the
combination of etoposide/cisplatin. Interestingly, the
combination of cisplatin and BEZ235 displayed a
higher synergistic effect, which was associated with
a two-fold increase of HM-1 cell DNA fragmentation
compared with the combination of etoposide and cisplatin

(Figure 6). However, the combination of etoposide and
BEZ235 presented a weaker anti-HM-1 activity than the
combination of etoposide/cisplatin. Together, our data
indicated that BEZ235 in combination with cisplatin
could induce a stronger cytotoxic response in HM-1 than
the recommended etoposide/cisplatin combination used in
current NECC therapy. In agreement with our findings,
a previous report also showed that the combination of
cisplatin and BEZ235 had a better inhibitory effect on
medulloblastoma than the combination of etoposide
and BEZ235 [39]. These observations imply we might
anticipate an improved efficacy of cisplatin plus BEZ235
for treating NECC patients. Our data demonstrated that
HM-1 cell viability could be further inhibited under the
triple-drug combination, in which BEZ235 plus etoposide
and cisplatin generated the highest inhibitory effect
(Figure 6). Notably, this triple-drug combination also
significantly induced HM-1 cell DNA fragmentation.
Thus, genotoxic agents plus PI3K inhibitor could be
a novel and effective therapeutic option for treating
NECC. Our data could serve as pre-clinical evidence for
initiating trials combining PI3K inhibitors with the current
etoposide/cisplatin regimen for NECC patients.

concentrations of BKM120 (1, 2.5, or 5 μM) or BEZ235 (10, 100, or 1000 nM). (A) HM-1 cells were pre-processed with PE active

quantitative bar graphs to represent the normalized statistical data of caspase-3 activity in the histograms above. Under all concentrations
of BKM120 and BEZ235 treatment, events of cell apoptosis were significantly increased (*p < 0.05 vs. control). (B) DNA fragmentation
was signiﬁcantly increased at ≥ 2.5 μM of BKM120 and ≥ 100 nM of BEZ235. DNA fragmentation was measured using the Cell Death

We acknowledged that the HM-1 cell line was
derived from only one NECC patient. Nonetheless, due to
its rare occurrence, no other NECC cell lines were available
to be included in this study [40]. Moreover, the drug
sensitivity of neuroendocrine tumor cell lines showed wide
variations in recent reports [41, 42]. Thus, we recognized
that more clinical samples should be collected to explore
the NECC tumor progression process and to verify the
drug mechanism of action before launching a clinical trial
to determining the optimal NECC multi-drug regimens.
In summary, we showed that the new NECC
cell line HM-1 could be a representative cell-based
model for NECC research. Our data demonstrated that
combination treatment with the genotoxic drugs etoposide
and cisplatin with BEZ235 resulted in enhanced cell
cytotoxic responses in HM-1 by reducing cell viability
and increasing cell apoptosis. Our results suggested that
the triple-drug combination of genotoxic drugs with PI3K
inhibitor present a potential therapeutic approach against
NECC (Figure 7). We predict that this novel human tumorderived cell line will be an important model system for
studying NECC tumorigenesis. By screening potential

anticancer agents and discovering predictive biomarkers,
further analysis on HM-1 might provide insights for the
development of new NECC treatment strategies.

mL of amphotericin B at 37°C with 5% CO2. Colony
derived from single cell was then selected and transferred
to 96-well plates for continued culturing. We noted that
HM-1 cells required a minimum cell density (3 × 103 cells/
cm2) to grow. This primary cultured cancer cell line was
annotated as HM-1 (Hsinchu MacKay-1).

Total RNA from the HM-1 cells was extracted
by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Three micrograms of total
RNA were reverse-transcribed using SuperScript™ III
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed
with Phire Hot Start II DNA Polymerase (Thermo
Scientific). The primer sequences were the following:
HPV-16, 5ʹ-GCACCAAAAGAGAACTGCAA-3ʹ and
5ʹ-ATGCATAAATCCCGAAAAGC-3ʹ; HPV-18, 5ʹ-T
GTATGGAGACACATTGGAAAA-3ʹ and 5ʹ-GAGTC
GTTCCTGTCGTGCTC-3ʹ; GAPDH, 5ʹ-ACACCC
ACTCCTCCACCTTT-3ʹ and 5ʹ-TACTCCTTGGAGGC
CATGTG-3ʹ.

Doubling time assay
A total of 1 × 105 HM-1 cells were seeded in 6-cm petri
dishes and cultured at 37°C in ambient air with 5% CO2 for 24
hours. The cells were cultured and harvested every 24 hours
using trypsin-EDTA (Gibco). Then, cells were counted by
hemocytometer. We calculated the doubling time as follows:
59 (relative fold of cell numbers = 2) – 24 (relative fold of cell
numbers = 1) = 35 hours.

Western blot analysis
Cell extracts were isolated using RIPA lysis buffer
(Roche) and quantitated by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).
Proteins were separated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), and then the gel was
transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore) using a
Tank Transfer System (Bio-Rad). The membranes were
then incubated with different primary antibodies overnight
at 4°C. Species-specific Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies were used for detecting
the primary antibodies. Detection was accomplished using
an ECL chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare) and
the images were exposed to films. The anti-synaptophysin
(SYP), pAkt, and p4E-BP1 antibodies were obtained from

Short tandem repeat analysis
HM-1 cells were counted and diluted to 1 × 106
cells/mL with PBS. Then, cells were centrifuged again
and the supernatant was discarded. Short tandem
repeat (STR) analysis was entrusted to GeneLabs Life
Science (Taipei, Taiwan). The DNA was amplified
using the GenePrint® 10 System, and the STR results
were analyzed using the Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA
Analyzer and GeneMapperTM Software. The data was
shown in the Supplementary Table 1.

Figure 7: Schematic model for a novel therapeutic strategy for treating NECC. Genotoxic agents (i.e., etoposide and cisplatin)

could induce DNA damage, while PI3K inhibitor (i.e., BEZ235) blocked PI3K/mTOR pathway and induced caspase-3 activity. With the
combination of genotoxic agents and BEZ235, the synergistic effect could further up-regulate the HM-1 apoptosis. The drug combination
of genotoxic agents and BEZ235 might be a novel therapeutic option for NECC patients.

measured at 570/450 nm. Each experiment was performed in
triplicate and repeated at least three times.

Immunocytochemistry

DNA fragmentation ELISA

HM-1 cells were seeded on sterile glass coverslips
overnight. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS
and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. Then,
cells were blocked with 3% BSA/PBS at room temperature.
After blocking, cells were incubated in blocking solution
along with anti-SYP antibody at 4°C overnight. The
secondary antibody used was anti-rabbit IgG-DyLight488
(Jackson). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342
(Invitrogen). Phalloidin (Invitrogen) was used to label
the actin cytoskeleton. All images were captured using a
confocal microscope (LSM510 Meta, Zeiss).

HM-1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density
of 6 × 104 cells/well. After allowing the cells to adhere,
drugs were added to each well for 24 hours. Apoptosis
was assessed by DNA fragmentation using the Cell
Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Applied Science)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Each experiment
was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.

Cell Caspase-3 apoptosis
HM-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a
density of 3 × 105 cells/well. After allowing the cells
to adhere, drugs were added to each well for 24 hours.
After washing, cells were stained using the PE Active
Caspase-3 Apoptosis Kit (BD Biosciences) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol and analyzed using a flow
cytometer system (BD Accuri C6). Each experiment was
performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.

Xenotransplantation
A total of 5 × 106 HM-1 cells were implanted
subcutaneously on the lateral body wall in the axillary
region caudal to the foreleg of female BALB/c nude mice
aged 6–8 weeks from National Laboratory Animal Center
(NLAC) as instructed by the animal center technician.
We measured the HM-1 tumor transplanted on the
backs using a caliper in two dimensions twice per week,
starting 1 week after inoculation, and the tumor volume
was calculated (width2 × length × 1/2). The mice were
sacrificed 4 weeks after cell inoculation, and then tumors
were dissected for further histological analysis.

Statistics
The data were analyzed using SigmaPlot v.10 and
expressed as the mean with the standard error of the mean
(SEM). Statistical significance was determined by a p
value < 0.05 using Student’s t-test.
