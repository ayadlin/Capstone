Abstract
p53 mutations occur in a large number of human malignancies. Mutant p53 is unable to affect downstream genes
necessary for DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis.
The styrylquinazoline CP-31398 can rescue destabilized
mutant p53 expression and promote activity of wild-type
p53. The present study examines chemopreventive effects of
CP-31398 on intestinal adenoma development in an animal
model of familial adenomatous polyposis. Effects were
examined at both early and late stages of adenoma formation.
Effects of CP-31398 on early-stage adenomas were determined
by feeding 7-week-old female C57BL/6J-APCmin (heterozygous)
and wild-type C57BL/6J mice with American Institute of
Nutrition-76A diets containing 0, 100, or 200 ppm of CP31398 for 75 days. To examine activity toward late-stage
adenomas, CP-31398 administration was delayed until
15 weeks of age and continued for 50 days. During early-stage
intervention, dietary CP-31398 suppressed development of
intestinal tumors by 36% (P < 0.001) and 75% (P < 0.0001), at
low and high dose, respectively. During late-stage intervention, CP-31398 also significantly suppressed intestinal polyp
formation, albeit to a lesser extent than observed with early
intervention. Adenomas in treated mice showed increased
apoptotic cell death and decreased proliferation in conjunction with increased expression of p53, p21WAF1/CIP, cleaved
caspase-3, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. These
observations show for the first time that the p53-modulating
agent CP-31398 possesses significant chemopreventive activity
in vivo against intestinal neoplastic lesions in genetically
predisposed APCmin/+ mice. Chemopreventive activity of other
agents that restore tumor suppressor functions of mutant p53
in tumor cells is currently under investigation. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in Western
countries, including the United States. About 145,290 new cases of
colorectal cancer and 56,290 related deaths are expected in 2008
(1). Epidemiologic and experimental studies indicate that the risk
of developing colon cancer may be attributable to genetic and
environmental factors, including endogenously occurring promoting agents (2). Progression of normal epithelium to colon cancer is
a multistep process involving accumulation of multiple genetic

alterations (3, 4). The p53 tumor suppressor protein is involved in
DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis through
transcriptional regulation of genes implicated in these pathways
and by direct interaction with other proteins (5, 6). Although
nonmutational activation of p53 may occur very early during
cancer progression (7), mutations that inactivate p53 are present in
more than 50% of all cancers, including colon cancer, giving rise to
aggressive cancers that are difficult to treat by chemotherapy or
ionizing radiation (7, 8). p53 mutations alter the structure and
thermal stability of the protein (9, 10), affecting its ability to bind to
p53 response elements and regulate transcription of downstream
genes (11). In addition, we and others have shown that increased
levels of electrophilic lipids bind with p53 and block its nuclear
translocalization, leading to reduced p53 activity (12).
Several attempts to restore mutant p53 as growth suppressor
included microinjection of monoclonal antibody 421, COOHterminal peptide of p53, and small molecules such as CP-31398
and PRIMA-1 (13–19). Early on, we determined that dietary CP31398 protects against chemically induced early colonic neoplastic
lesions (20). More recently, Wang and colleagues (21) showed that
p53 modulators suppress growth of human colon tumor xenografts.
Similarly, Tang and colleagues (22) found that CP-31398 suppressed
UAB-induced squamous skin cancer in mice by restoring mutant p53
function. In this regard, CP-31398 can stabilize p53, protect against
thermal denaturation, and maintain monoclonal antibody 1620
epitope conformation in newly synthesized p53 (16). CP-31398
stabilizes wild-type p53 in cells by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated
ubiquitination and degradation (18, 23). In a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, CP-31398 promotes binding of mutant p53
to p53 response elements in vivo (24). Other studies using the
purified p53 core domain have shown that CP-31398 can restore
DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in vitro (25). Given the
multifunctional properties of p53 in cell pathway regulation, it is
difficult to determine the exact mechanism by which CP-31398 and
other p53 modulators affect p53-induced growth arrest or apoptosis.
As part of a study of p53-modulating agents, we identified a
tolerable dose of CP-31398 and showed its efficacy in a wellestablished (APCmin/+ ) model of mouse intestinal neoplasia. We
also determined the effects of CP-31398 on intestinal tumor
proliferation, apoptosis, and levels of p53, p21WAF1/CIP, cleaved
caspase-3, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP).

Materials and Methods
Animals, diets, and CP-31398. Heterozygous female Min (C57BL/6JAPCmin/+ ) and wild-type C57BL/6J female mice were obtained at 5 wk of age
from The Jackson Laboratory. Ingredients for the semipurified diets were
purchased from Dyets, Inc. and stored at 4jC before diet preparation. Diets
were based on the modified American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-76A diet.
The high-fat semipurified diet includes 21.3% casein, 43.5% corn starch, 12%
dextrose, 12% corn oil, 5% alphacel, 3.5% AIN mineral mix, 1.2% AIN revised

vitamin mix, 0.3% D,L-methionine, and 0.2 choline bitartrate (26). CP-31398
was premixed with a small quantity of diet and then blended into bulk diet
using a Hobart mixer. Both control and experimental diets were prepared
weekly and stored in a cold room. CP-31398 was kindly provided by the
National Cancer Institute chemopreventive drug repository (Rockville, MD).
Agent content in the experimental diets was determined periodically in
multiple samples taken from the top, middle, and bottom portions of
individual diet preparations to verify uniform distribution.
Maximum tolerated dose. To estimate the appropriate dose level for
the efficacy study, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined in
female C57BL/6J mice by feeding CP-31398 in a 6-wk toxicity study. MTD
was defined as the highest dose that causes no more than a 10% body
weight decrement or produces mortality or any external signs of toxicity
that would be predicted to shorten the natural life span of the animal. At
7 wk of age, groups of female C57BL/6J mice (six per group) were fed
experimental diets containing 0, 75, 150, 300, 600, or 1,200 ppm of CP-31398,
and body weights were recorded twice weekly for 6 wk. All animals were
monitored daily for signs of toxicity, such as ill appearance, circling rashes,
tremors, roughened coat, rhinitis, chromodacryorrhea, and prostration. At
the end of 6 wk, mice were sacrificed and their oral cavity, colon, small
intestine, stomach, liver, and kidneys were examined for any abnormalities
under a dissection microscope.
Efficacy study. The experimental protocol is summarized in Fig. 1.
Following 5 d of quarantine, all mice were distributed so that average body
weights in each group were about equal (10 APCmin/+ mice in each group
and 6 wild-type mice as parallel treatment groups to compare food intake,
growth rate, and tumor formation in APCmin/+ ). The animals were
transferred to a holding room where they were housed individually in
plastic cages with filter tops. Laboratory conditions were controlled to
maintain a 12-h light/dark cycle at 50% relative humidity and at 21 F 1jC.
Mice were fed control or experimental diets containing 100 or 200 ppm of
CP-31398 at either early intervention (7 wk of age) or late intervention
(15 wk of age) until termination of the study (f75 d for early intervention,
50 d for late intervention). Animals were weighed twice weekly and
monitored daily for signs of weight loss or lethargy that might indicate
intestinal obstruction or anemia. After necropsy, intestinal tracts were
dissected from esophagus to distal rectum, spread onto filter paper, opened
longitudinally with fine scissors, and cleaned with sterile saline, and then

examined under a dissection microscope with 5 magnification for tumor
counts. This procedure was completed by two individuals who were blinded
to experimental group and genetic status of mice. Colonic and other small
intestinal tumors that required further histopathologic evaluation to
identify adenoma, adenocarcinoma, and enlarged lymph nodes were fixed
in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin blocks, and
processed by routine H&E staining. In addition, multiple samples of
tumors from the small intestines and colons and normal-appearing colonic
mucosa were harvested and stored in liquid nitrogen for analysis of p53,
cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP expression levels.
Immunohistochemistry. To evaluate the effect of CP-31398 on
proliferation, we assessed proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)
expression in large intestinal tumor tissue (delayed intervention) sections
by immunohistochemistry, as described (16). Briefly, paraffin-embedded
colons from the delayed intervention study were cut longitudinally to
5-Am-thick sections and mounted on microscopic slides. After deparaffinization, sections were blocked for endogenous peroxidase activity and
incubated with 1% milk. PCNA antibody (PharMingen) was applied at a
1:200 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, then washed and incubated with
secondary anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min, and then washed and incubated with
avidin-biotin complex reagent (Vector Laboratories). After rinsing with PBS,
the slides were incubated with the chromogen 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
for 3 min and then rinsed and counterstained with hematoxylin. Scoring
was performed by two investigators blinded to the identity of the samples
who scored at least 30 crypts per colon (light microscopy at 400
magnification). Cells with a brown nucleus were considered positive. The
proliferation index was determined by dividing the number of positive cells
per crypt by the number of cells of the entire crypt or each of its
compartments (upper, middle, and lower) and multiplying by 100.
Apoptosis. Large intestinal tumor tissues from delayed intervention
were fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h and then embedded in paraffin.
Sections, f5 Am, were cut and mounted on slides, rehydrated, and stained
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) method. Briefly, slides were incubated with 3% H2O2
in PBS for 5 min, rinsed, and then incubated in TdT buffer [140 mmol/L
cacodylate (pH 7.2), 30 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/L CoCl2] for 15 min at
room temperature. TdT reaction mixture [0.2 unit/AL TdT, 2 nmol/L biotin11-dUTP, 100 mmol/L cacohydrate, 2.5 mmol/L CoCl2, 0.1 mmol/L DTT, and

reduced body weight of mice by 14% and 42%, respectively,
compared with control diet–fed mice. At doses up to 300 ppm,
CP-31398 did affect body weight. Based on these findings, 100 and
200 ppm of CP-31398 were selected for efficacy studies. At these
doses, CP-31398 had no apparent adverse effects on mice during
either the 75-day (early intervention) or 50-day (late intervention)
efficacy studies. Body weights of all mice fed diets containing
100 or 200 ppm were comparable; however, body weights of mice

fed the control diet were significantly lower (data not shown). This
was due mainly to increased small intestinal tumor burden in
controls that resulted in impaired food absorption and anemia.
Chronic administration of CP-31398 produced no signs of toxicity
or any gross changes indicative of toxicity in the organs examined.
Effects on intestinal tumor formation. APCmin/+ mice
spontaneously develop intestinal tumors, essentially all of which
(>95%) occur in the small intestine. In this study, on average, mice
developed 17 to 58 (early intervention) or 25 to 67 (delayed
intervention) tumors per mouse in the small intestine, but only 0
to 3 tumors per mouse in the colon. All histopathologically
classified tumors in the small intestine, as well as those in the
colon, were adenomas (adenomatous polyps), with no evidence of
local invasion of the lamina propria. Figure 2A summarizes the
chemopreventive effect of CP-31398 administered at 100 or
200 ppm on tumor multiplicity in the small intestine. In the early
intervention study, the low and high dose of CP-31398 significantly
suppressed polyp formation by 39% (P < 0.001) and 75.6%
(P < 0.0001), respectively, compared with controls. In the delayed
intervention study, low and high doses of CP-31398 significantly
suppressed small intestinal polyp formation by 23% (P < 0.04) and
48% (P < 0.001), respectively, compared with controls. Data were
also analyzed for the colon alone. In the early intervention study,
the mean number of tumors per mouse was 1.2 in controls, 0.7 in
the low-dose group, and 0.2 in the high-dose group. Delayed
intervention found multiplicity of 1.6, 0.9, and 0.5 in control, lowdose, and high-dose groups, respectively. Although both 100 and

www.aacrjournals.org

200 ppm of CP-31398 reduced colon tumor multiplicity, only the
higher dose produced statistically significant inhibition (Fig. 2B). In
addition, we observed statistically significant difference between
the mice fed 100 and 200 ppm of CP-31398 in small intestinal
tumor multiplicity both in interventions and in colon tumors of
early intervention (Fig. 2A and B).
Effects on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. Figures 3A
and 4 summarize the effects of CP-31398 on tumor cell
proliferation in the late intervention study as measured by PCNA
overexpression. CP-31398 dose dependently suppressed proliferation. In the 100 ppm group, proliferation was diminished by 24.5%
(P < 0.002), and in the 200 ppm group, by 37% (P < 0.0001). Figures
3B and 4 show the effects of CP-31398 on tumor cell apoptosis.
Compared with controls, low and high doses of CP-31398 induced
a 2.2- and 3.8-fold increase in intestinal tumor cell apoptosis.
Modulation of p53, p21WAF1/CIP, cleaved caspase-3, and
cleaved PARP. Expression levels of p53, p21WAF1/CIP cleaved
caspase-3, and cleaved PARP are important indicators of cell
growth arrest and apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5A, CP-31398 dose
dependently induced expression of p53 protein in intestinal tumor
tissues in both early and late intervention protocols. In addition,
tumors in mice fed CP-31398 showed significant induction
of p21 WAF1/CIP expression when compared with controls.
However, although CP-31398 effected a dose-dependent increase
in p21WAF1/CIP during early intervention, no such effect was seen in
late intervention (Fig. 5A). Figure 5B and C shows the proteolytic
cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 activation, two hallmarks of

Discussion
p53 mutations are common in many human cancers, including
colorectal cancer (8, 27). Restoring mutant p53 function and/or
enhancing wild-type p53 by genetic means suppresses growth of
various tumor types (11, 12, 27). The identification of CP-31398 and
other small molecules such as PRIMA-1 that activate mutant p53
could constitute an effective pharmacologic approach for cancer
prevention/treatment (28–33). Although CP-31398 has been
extensively studied in in vitro models (13–19, 28, 29), only a few
studies have assessed the tumor inhibitory potential of CP-31398
in vivo (20–22).
In this study, we evaluated the toxicity, optimal dosing, tumor
inhibition, and effectiveness on selected molecular targets of CP31398. Our results are the first to show that CP-31398 effectively
suppresses intestinal tumor formation whether given early or late
in polyp formation. It is important to note, however, that CP-31398
showed a more pronounced effect on tumor suppression when
administered early during tumor development, suggesting its
potential usefulness as a chemopreventive agent. The present
results further corroborate the anticarcinogenic effects of CP-31398
against UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis in mice and chemically
induced colon carcinogenesis in rats (20, 22). In the skin model,
CP-31398 was administered either i.p. or topically; in the present
study, CP-31398 was administered in the diet. By all routes of
administration, CP-31398 showed antitumor effects. Compared
with previous studies in the APCmin/+ model, the efficacy of CP31398 in this study is dramatic and comparable with nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., celecoxib and sulindac) and other
agents (26, 34–37). APCmin/+ mice are an appropriate model for
human colon cancer, as the mechanism of APC gene inactivation
mimics that observed in familial adenomatous polyposis patients
and most sporadic human colon adenomas (34, 38).

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

The mechanisms through which p53 inhibits cell proliferation
and induces apoptosis have been studied in in vitro models (5–8).
In the present study, CP-31398 suppressed tumor cell proliferation
and induced apoptosis in conjunction with up-regulation of p53
and its downstream effector p21. These results are consistent with
previous studies showing an increase in p53 target genes by CP31398, as well as in p53 reporter gene expression in cancer cells (11,
13, 29, 39).
The importance of p53 mutations in colon cancers is well
established (8, 27). However, in the APCmin/+ model, p53
mutations are likely a late event in tumor development. This
suggests that restoration of mutant p53 function plays a minor
role in the tumor inhibitory activity of CP-31398 seen in this
study. On the other hand, activation of wild-type p53 by CP-31398
might be a major mechanism leading to suppression of tumor
growth in APCmin/+ mice. In this regard, activation of wild-type
p53 by CP-31398 has been shown in other models, both in vitro
and in vivo (16–22). It is also possible that CP-31398 affects
additional targets. Regardless of its exact mechanism, the finding
that CP-31398 given either early or late in tumor development can
suppress tumor growth indicates that p53 is a rational target for
chemoprevention of colorectal cancer. Ultimately, the combined
use of low molecular weight p53-modulating agents acting
through different mechanisms (e.g., CP-31398 and PRIMA-1) or
combinations with agents targeting other molecular pathways is
likely to substantially increase antitumor effects. Taken together,
these findings support further development of CP-31398 for colon
cancer prevention and treatment.
