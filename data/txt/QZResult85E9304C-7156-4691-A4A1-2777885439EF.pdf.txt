Abstract
Although the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole has been shown
to be very effective in the treatment of hormone-dependent
postmenopausal breast cancer, some patients with advanced
disease will develop resistance to treatment. To investigate
therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to anastrozole
treatment, we have used an intratumoral aromatase model
that simulates postmenopausal breast cancer patients with
estrogen-dependent tumors. Growth of the tumors in the mice
was inhibited by both anastrozole and fulvestrant compared
with the control tumors. Nevertheless, tumors had doubled in
size at 5 weeks of treatment. We therefore investigated
whether switching the original treatments to anastrozole or
fulvestrant alone or the combination of anastrozole plus
fulvestrant would reduce tumor growth. The results showed
that the best strategy to reverse the insensitivity to anastrozole or fulvestrant is to combine the two agents. Additionally,
the tumors treated with anastrozole plus fulvestrant from the
beginning had only just doubled their size after 14 weeks of
treatment, whereas the anastrozole and fulvestrant treatments
alone resulted in 9- and 12-fold increases in tumor size,
respectively, in the same time period. Anastrozole plus
fulvestrant from the beginning or in sequence was associated
with down-regulation of signaling proteins involved in the
development of hormonal resistance such as insulin-like
growth factor type I receptor B, mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), p-MAPK, AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p-mTOR, and estrogen receptor A compared with
tumors treated with anastrozole or fulvestrant alone. These
results suggest that blocking the estrogen receptor and
aromatase may delay or reverse the development of resistance
to aromatase inhibitors in advanced breast cancer patients.

Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related
deaths among women in the United States and is by far the most
common cancer in women worldwide (1). It occurs more frequently in postmenopausal than in younger women and is a highly
estrogen-dependent disease. In postmenopausal women, estrogen
is produced in a number of extragonadal sites (2). These include
the adipose tissue of the breast where estrogen acts locally in a
paracrine or intracrine fashion to promote breast tumor develop-

ment and progression (3, 4). Estrogen levels in the normal breast
tissue of postmenopausal women are generally much higher than
those in plasma, and levels in malignant tissue are higher than
those in normal breast tissue (5). It has been observed that
two thirds of breast carcinomas contain aromatase (the enzyme
mediating the rate limiting step of estrogen biosynthesis) and
its activity is higher in tumor than in normal areas of the breast
(6–10).
Current first-line or adjuvant treatment options for postmenopausal hormone-dependent breast cancer patients involve either
blocking estrogen from binding to the estrogen receptor (ER) with
antiestrogens or inhibiting estrogen synthesis with aromatase inhibitors such as the nonsteroidal agents anastrozole and letrozole
or the steroidal agent exemestane. Until recently, the endocrine
therapy of choice for ER+ breast cancer was tamoxifen. Unfortunately, due to its estrogen-like effect, the use of tamoxifen significantly increases the risk of endometrial cancer and stroke (11).
Additionally, not all patients with advanced disease respond to
tamoxifen, and many of those that do respond eventually progress
with resistant disease. The search for a more effective antiestrogen
without agonist activity ultimately resulted in the development of
the pure antiestrogen fulvestrant. This well-tolerated drug binds to
ER competitively and causes its degradation and down-regulation
(12, 13). Fulvestrant has been approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive advanced
breast cancer with disease progression following prior endocrine
therapy (12, 14, 15).
The aromatase inhibitors have been approved as first-line
treatment option for hormone-dependent advanced breast cancer
in postmenopausal patients. When anastrozole was compared with
tamoxifen in several clinical trials (The North American and
TARGET trials), the aromatase inhibitor provided significant
efficacy and tolerability advantages in postmenopausal patients
with advanced breast cancer and a delay in the emergence of
endocrine resistance (16, 17). This is supported by the result of
preclinical studies showing that estrogen deprivation with aromatase inhibitor is superior to tamoxifen, resulting in greater
tumor regressions and prolonged time to regrowth (18). On the
other hand, as with any cancer treatment, some patients eventually
develop resistance to aromatase inhibitors and experience disease
progression. Data from preclinical studies have suggested that
acquired aromatase inhibitor resistance may be due to up-regulation of growth factor receptors such as HER2 and insulin-like
growth factor type I receptor (IGF-IR; refs. 19, 20). Increased
expression of these receptors may promote activation of downstream protein kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) and AKT, which, in turn, could result in increased ER
phosphorylation and activation and sensitization of tumor cells to
estrogen. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is one of
the most evolutionarily conserved downstream effectors of AKT
and executes the most critical functions of AKT with regard to

increased cell proliferation (21). Some authors also consider mTOR
as a nodal point connecting different signaling pathways (22).
Our laboratory has developed an intratumoral aromatase model
in rodents that mimics, to some extent, postmenopausal ER+
breast cancer patients (23). Because the mouse has no significant
peripheral production of estrogen and no adrenal androgen
production (24, 25), MCF-7 cells engineered to express aromatase
(26) were inoculated into ovariectomized athymic mice (23). To
date, the intratumoral aromatase xenograft model has proved
accurate in predicting the outcome of clinical trials such as ATAC
and allowed us to show that the aromatase inhibitor letrozole was
more effective than tamoxifen in suppressing breast tumor growth
without causing endometrial proliferation (27).
Currently, there is a great interest in second-line treatments for
patients that received aromatase inhibitors as first-line therapy
for advanced disease. Fulvestrant is now being investigated as an
appropriate next step in the treatment of refractory breast tumors
(28, 29). In the present study, we have used the intratumoral
aromatase model to investigate strategies to delay resistance in
anastrozole-treated breast tumors and the optimal treatment
sequence following anastrozole failure.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Phenol red–free modified IMEM, DMEM, penicillin/streptomycin solution, 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution (1 mmol/L), Dulbecco’s PBS,
and geneticin (G418) were obtained from Life Technologies. Trypsinversene was purchased from Biosource Biofluids Cell Culture Products.
Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and charcoal/dextran–treated FBS were obtained
from Hyclone. Androstenedione and tamoxifen were obtained from Sigma
Chemical Co. Matrigel was purchased from BD Biosciences. Fulvestrant
(Faslodex) and anastrozole (Arimidex) were supplied by Dr. E. Anderson
(AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kits
and Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies against HER2, p-HER2, and p-HER3 were
purchased from Upstate. Antibodies against p-MAPK, MAPK, AKT, IGF-IRh,
mTOR, p-mTOR, and h-actin were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antimouse and antirabbit
antibodies were purchased form Bio-Rad. Antibody against ERa was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Radioactive ligand for the aromatase assay, 3H-androstenedione (specific activity, 23.5 Ci/mmol), was
purchased from Perkin-Elmer. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells stably
transfected with the human aromatase gene were provided by Dr. Shiuan
Chen (Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, California) as
previously reported (26).
Postmenopausal intratumoral aromatase model. All animal studies
were carried out according to the guidelines and with the approval of
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
Maryland School of Medicine. Female nude athymic ovariectomized mice,
4 to 6 weeks old, were obtained from National Cancer Institute-Frederick
Cancer Research and Development Center. The animals were housed in a
pathogen-free environment under controlled conditions of light and
humidity and received food and water ad libitum. Animals were allowed to
acclimatize for 48 h after shipment before tumor inoculation was carried out.
MCF-7Ca cells were inoculated s.c. into the mice at one site on each flank
with 100 AL of cell suspension (4.4  106 cells per site). Because athymic
mice were deficient in adrenal androgens (24, 25), they were supplemented
with s.c. injections of the aromatase substrate androstenedione (100 Ag/d)
for the duration of the experiment.
First-line treatment with anastrozole, fulvestrant, or anastrozole
plus fulvestrant. When the tumors reached a measurable size (f300
mm3), animals were assigned to the treatment groups so that tumor
volumes were equivalent and continued to be injected with the androstenedione supplement (100 Ag/d, s.c., 5 d/wk; control, n = 10) for the
duration of the experiment. The treatment groups were composed of

anastrozole alone (200 Ag/d, s.c.; n = 30), anastrozole (200 Ag/d s.c.) plus
fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d s.c.; n = 10), and fulvestrant alone (1,000 Ag/d s.c.;
n = 20). The doses of fulvestrant and anastrozole used had previously
been determined to be maximally effective in reducing tumor growth
(30, 31). All drugs and androstenedione were prepared in vehicle (0.3%
hydropropylcellulose in 0.9% NaCl). Tumors were measured weekly
with calipers and volumes were calculated using the formula 4/3pr21r 2,
where r 1 V r 2. Animals were treated for the times indicated in the figures,
after which they were sacrificed by decapitation and tumors and uteri
were excised, cleaned, and stored at 80jC.
Second-line treatment after anastrozole and fulvestrant. Tumors of
animals (n = 30) treated with anastrozole alone (200 Ag/d) were growing
by week 5. These mice were then assigned to the following treatment
groups: one group continued on anastrozole treatment (200 Ag/d; n = 10);
another group was given a combination of anastrozole (200 Ag/d) and
fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d; n = 12); and a third group was switched to
fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d; n = 8). The animals (n = 20) treated with fulvestrant
(1,000 Ag/d) were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: one group
continued treatment on fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d; n = 6); another group was
given a combination of anastrozole (200 Ag/d) and fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d;
n = 7); and a third group was switched to anastrozole (200 Ag/d; n = 7).
As before, tumors were measured weekly and volumes calculated. The
experiment was terminated at week 14 when tumors and uteri were excised
and weighed.
Radiometric assay of tumor aromatase activity. This assay was done
in a similar manner that was already described (32). Briefly, the tumors were
homogenized in ice-cold PBS and aliquots (500 AL) of the homogenates
were incubated with cofactors (D-glucose-6-phosphate, h-NADP+, and
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; Sigma) and 0.5 ACi of 3H-1h-androstenedione (specific activity, 23.5 Ci/mmol) for 1 h at 37jC. The reaction
mixtures were extracted with chloroform and further treated with a 2.5%
charcoal suspension. The 3H2O in the supernatant was measured using
a scintillation counter and corrected for protein concentration to give
enzyme activity in femtomoles per microgram of protein per hour. The
results were expressed as percent of control.
Western blotting. Protein extracts from tumor tissues were prepared
by homogenizing the tissue in PBS and centrifuging at 2,500 rpm for
20 min. The cells lysates were obtained by sonicating the cells in RIPA
buffer. The protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad
method. Sixty micrograms of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was
probed for specific primary antibody as specified in the manufacturer’s
protocol. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with ECL detection
reagents and quantified by densitometry using Molecular Dynamics
software (ImageQuant).
Statistical analysis. Random coefficient models (S-PLUS, 7.0, Insightful
Corp.) were used to assess patterns of tumor response to treatment. Data
on tumor volume are longitudinal (i.e., tumor volume was observed over
time). The model of exponential growth was appropriate to the data.
Therefore, tumor volumes were log transformed. We estimated an exponential parameter controlling the tumor growth rate for each of the
treatment groups. The resulting model had random effects for the intercept at the tumor level and for the slope at the mouse (ID) level. The
unstructured covariance matrix was selected via model diagnostics. There
was no site ( flank) effect on tumor growth. Average uterine weight was
estimated for each treatment group and compared between these groups
using the general linear model approach. Appropriate contrasts were
used to compare the groups’ mean uterine weight. The differences
between the treatment groups in the aromatase activity assay were
analyzed by ANOVA. The Tukey-Kramer method was applied for multiple
comparisons. All tests were two sided and P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

inoculated s.c. into athymic nude mice supplemented with
androstenedione (100 Ag/mouse/d s.c.). Once the tumors reached
a measurable size of 300 mm3 (after 2 months), the mice were
assigned to four treatment groups so that mean tumor volumes
were not significantly different at the start of treatment: control
(vehicle alone), anastrozole (200 Ag/d s.c.), fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d
s.c.), and anastrozole (200 Ag/d) plus fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d).
All animals continued to be supplemented with androstenedione.
The mean tumor volumes for each of the groups measured weekly
are shown in Fig. 1A. The tumors in the control group doubled in
size after 2 weeks whereas the tumors in the anastrozole and
fulvestrant groups doubled after 5 weeks. The tumors in mice
receiving the combination therapy remained stable at 300 mm3 for
>7 weeks when they began to show a slow increase in tumor
volume, such that they had doubled at week 14. Statistical analysis
of tumor volume after the first 6 weeks of treatment showed that
anastrozole (P = 0.001), fulvestrant (P = 0.012), and anastrozole plus
fulvestrant (P < 0.0001) caused a significant decrease in tumor
growth when compared with control. The combination therapy
was superior to anastrozole (P = 0.037) or fulvestrant (P = 0.011)
treatment alone. Analysis of tumor volume at week 9 showed that
tumors in the anastrozole- and fulvestrant-treated groups continued to grow whereas tumors in the anastrozole plus fulvestrant–
treated group remained at 300 mm3. Nevertheless, tumors in the
anastrozole-treated group remained significantly smaller than

those in the control group (P = 0.013), and the effect of fulvestrant
at 9 weeks in that tumor volume was marginally statistically
significant compared with the control (P = 0.056). The combination
of anastrozole plus fulvestrant was the most effective therapy in
reducing tumor growth when compared with control (P < 0.0001).
When the experiment was terminated after 14 weeks of treatment,
the combination of anastrozole plus fulvestrant was clearly superior in controlling tumor growth compared with either anastrozole
(P = 0.0003) or fulvestrant (P = 0.009) given alone.
Effects of second-line therapies on tumors proliferating
during anastrozole and/or fulvestrant treatment. At week 5,
groups of animals receiving anastrozole or fulvestrant alone were
randomized to cross over to fulvestrant or anastrozole, respectively,
or anastrozole plus fulvestrant, whereas the others remained on
their original treatments (Fig. 1A). After 9 weeks of second-line
therapy, we observed that the replacement of anastrozole by
fulvesrant or fulvestrant by anastrozole had not reduced growth
compared with the tumors that remained in anastrozole or fulvestrant treatment alone (Fig. 1A). However, addition of fulvestrant to
the anastrozole treatment or anastrozole to the fulvestrant treatment was very effective in controlling tumor growth. Tumors of
mice on anastrozole and fulvestrant treatments continued to proliferate in that their mean volumes increased four and five times,
respectively, after the beginning of the second-line therapy
(week 5). Although the tumors of mice that switched from

in female ovariectomized nude mice as described in Materials and Methods. When the tumors reached a measurable size (f300 mm3), animals were assigned to the
treatment groups for the duration of the experiment. The treatment groups were injected with anastrozole (200 Ag/d; n = 30; ANA ), anastrozole (200 Ag/d) plus
fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d; n = 10; ANA + FUL ), and fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d; n = 20; FUL ) in addition to androstenedione (100 Ag/d) 5 d/wk. The control group received
androstenedione (100 Ag/d). At week 5, mice in the anastrozole group were assigned to the following treatment groups: one group continued on anastrozole
treatment (200 Ag/d; n = 10; ANA ); another group was given a combination of anastrozole (200 Ag/d) and fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d; n = 12; ANA to ANA + FUL );
and a third group switched to fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d; n = 8; ANA to FUL ). Animals (n = 20) treated with fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d) were assigned to three treatment
groups: one group continued treatment on fulvestrant (1,000 Ag/d; n = 6; FUL); another group was given a combination of anastrozole (200 Ag/d) and fulvestrant
(1,000 Ag/d; n = 7; FUL to ANA + FUL ); and a third group switched to anastrozole (200 Ag/d; n = 7; FUL to ANA ). Tumors were measured weekly and tumor volumes
were calculated. On week 6, the differences in growth rate of control versus ANA (P = 0.001), ANA + FUL (P < 0.0001), and FUL (P = 0.012) were statistically
significant. The differences in growth rate of ANA versus ANA + FUL (P = 0.037) and FUL versus ANA + FUL (P = 0.011) were statistically significant. On week 9, the
differences in growth rate of control versus ANA (P = 0.013) and ANA + FUL (P < 0.0001) were statistically significant whereas the difference between control
and fulvestrant had a marginal statistical significance (P = 0.056). At week 14, the differences in growth rate of ANA versus ANA + FUL (P = 0.0003) and ANA to
ANA + FUL (P = 0.019) were statistically significant. The differences in growth rate between FUL versus ANA + FUL (P = 0.009) and FUL to ANA + FUL (P = 0.047)

anastrozole, anastrozole + fulvestrant, fulvestrant,
anastrozole to fulvestrant, anastrozole to anastrozole +
fulvestrant, fulvestrant to anastrozole, and fulvestrant to

analyzed by Western blot, and compared with
vehicle-treated tumors (Control ) collected at 9 wk as
described in Materials and Methods. Blots show IGF-IRh
at 95 kDa, AKT at 60 kDa, MAPK and p-MAPK at
42 to 44 kDa, mTOR and p-mTOR at 289 kDa, and ERa
at 66 kDa. The blots were stripped and reprobed for

anastrozole or fulvestrant alone to the combination therapy also
continued growing, their growth rate was much slower (P = 0.019
and P = 0.047, respectively) and mean tumor volumes increased by
2.4- and 1.5-fold, respectively.
Effects of anastrozole and/or fulvestrant on uterine weight.
The measurement of uterine weight is a useful bioassay because
the uterus is very sensitive to the effects of estrogens. The uteri of
mice bearing MCF-7Ca xenografts and treated for 14 weeks were
removed and weighed. Anastrozole, fulvestrant, and the combination therapy all reduced uterine weight (Fig. 1B). The uterine
weights of all seven treatment groups were statistically different
from control (P < 0.0001). This finding suggests that the treatments
were effective in inhibiting the synthesis or action of estrogens
even if the tumors did not respond.
Effects of anastrozole and fulvestrant alone or in combination on the activation of growth factor receptor pathways. To
understand the mechanisms associated with resistance to anastrozole and fulvestrant and the responsiveness to the combination
therapy of anastrozole plus fulvestrant, we analyzed tumors collected from mice at the end of the treatment period. Thus, tumors
were collected at 14 weeks and submitted to immunoblot analysis
(Fig. 2). The results were quantified by densitometric analysis of the
bands and compared with vehicle-treated tumors (control) collected at 9 weeks. At week 14, all the treatment groups with tumors
that were continuing to grow and not responding to anastrozole or
fulvestrant therapy showed an increase in the expression of the
growth factor receptor IGF-IRh. The biggest increase was seen in
the anastrozole group where it was 1.8-fold compared with control.
On the other hand, tumors from the groups that were receiving the
combination therapy showed profoundly reduced levels of IGF-IRh
when compared with control. In a previous study where MCF-7Ca
tumors were treated with another aromatase inhibitor, letrozole,
we showed that resistance was associated with the activation of
growth factor receptor pathways, particularly the HER2/Raf/MAPK
signaling pathway (19). Therefore, the tumors from the present
study were also subjected to immunoblot analysis for HER2,

www.aacrjournals.org

p-HER2, and p-HER3. None of these proteins were detected in the
tumors lysates by the Western blot technique. However, MAPK,
p-MAPK, and AKT were down-regulated in the tumors from the
anastrozole plus fulvestrant–treated groups specially those that
had either received the treatment up front or had swapped to the
combination after treatment with anastrozole alone. The combination therapy either from the beginning or after treatment with
anastrozole or fulvestrant alone was associated with reduced
mTOR and p-mTOR expression compared with control tumors and
those treated with first-line anastrozole or fulvestrant. In contrast,
anastrozole-treated tumors showed an increase in mTOR and
p-mTOR expression of 1.4- and 1.6-fold, respectively. The combination of anastrozole plus fulvestrant either from the beginning
or after monotherapy was associated with a reduction in ERa
expression compared with control and with single-agent therapy.
Anastrozole-resistant tumors also showed a decrease in ERa
expression of 50% compared with control similar to that seen with
long-term letrozole-treated MCF-7Ca xenografts (19). Treatment
with fulvestrant as single agent and the switch from fulvestrant
to anastrozole or from anastrozole to fulvestrant caused upregulation of ERa expression of 2.2-, 4.2-, and 2.4-fold, respectively.
Effects of anastrozole and fulvestrant alone or in combination on tumor aromatase activity. To understand whether
changes in the intratumoral aromatase activity could be correlated
with response or resistance, the aromatase activity in the tumors
collected from the treatment groups was determined. Although
tumors were insensitive to anastrozole treatment by week 14, there
was an 86% reduction in aromatase activity when compared with
control (P < 0.01; Fig. 3). Fulvestrant, which has previously been
shown also to have inhibitory effects on aromatase activity (32), did
not cause a significant reduction in aromatase activity in vivo. The
combination of anastrozole plus fulvestrant from the beginning
was also able to inhibit aromatase by 73% (P < 0.05) but was not
statistically different from the anastrozole or fulvestrant group. The
switch from anastrozole to fulvestrant caused a significant increase
in aromatase activity when compared with the anastrozole alone

group (14-fold; P < 0.001). On the other hand, the switch from
anastrozole to the combination therapy did not result in any
change in aromatase activity when compared with the anastrozole
alone group. Surprisingly, the switch from fulvestrant to the
aromatase inhibitor anastrozole or to the combination therapy
caused an increase of 11- and 3-fold, respectively, when compared
with fulvestrant alone group (P < 0.01).

Discussion
Aromatase inhibitors have been shown to be very effective for
the treatment of hormone-dependent postmenopausal breast
cancer, and they are now used as standard adjuvant and first-line
therapy for advanced disease. Although recent clinical trials have
shown aromatase inhibitors to be more effective than tamoxifen,
most patients with advanced disease ultimately develop resistance
to the treatment. Furthermore, some patients are resistant to
therapy de novo. Our mouse model of human ER+ breast cancer
cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (MCF-7Ca cells;
ref. 27) simulates the postmenopausal breast cancer patient and
has predicted the findings of several clinical studies (17, 33). Using
this model, we have previously explored the mechanisms involved
in the acquisition of resistance to letrozole (19). Tumors that
responded initially to treatment with this aromatase inhibitor
eventually adapted to the pressure of endocrine treatment (after
56 weeks) by activating growth factor receptor pathways. In particular, proteins in the HER2/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway were
increased. These proteins are capable of interacting with the ER,

statistically significant. The difference in aromatase activity of anastrozoletreated tumors versus the anastrozole to fulvestrant group was statistically
significant (P < 0.001). The differences in aromatase activity of fulvestranttreated tumors versus the fulvestrant to anastrozole (P < 0.001) and fulvestrant
to anastrozole + fulvestrant (P < 0.01) groups were statistically significant.

resulting in ER transcription despite reduced estrogen levels (19).
Similarly, anastrozole also caused a decrease in tumor growth.
Although the tumors became refractory to treatment after 14
weeks, anastrozole was able to inhibit tumor aromatase activity
and reduced estrogen-dependent uterine weight. Resistance to
anastrozole treatment was associated with an increase in IGF-IRh,
mTOR, and p-mTOR expression. We also found up-regulation of
the same proteins in LTLTCa cells derived from the letrozoleresistant tumors (20). However, unlike the LTLTCa cells (19), no
up-regulation or activation of HER2 or MAPK was observed in the
anastrozole-resistant tumors. Both letrozole-resistant (19) and
anastrozole-resistant tumors showed a decrease in ERa expression
and aromatase activity. Other breast cancer models of endocrine
resistance developed by long-term estrogen deprivation or prolonged tamoxifen treatment (22, 34) also showed an association
between IGF-IR expression and signaling and cross talk with ERa.
The results previously shown and the ones shown here suggest that
the extent of resistance to treatment and/or the type of aromatase
inhibitor may result in a unique resistance mechanism. In fact,
Chen et al. (35) have shown that, although aromatase inhibitors
are very similar in terms of genes they regulate, aromatase inhibitor resistance varies between the anastrozole-, letrozole-, and
exemestane-resistant cell lines.
Several reports suggest that resistance to hormonal therapy may
involve estrogen hypersensitivity, up-regulation of signal transduction pathways such as the ones triggered by HER family members
and IGF-IR, and cross talk between signal transduction pathways
and ER pathway (34–37). Therefore, sensitivity to endocrine
therapy may be restored by interrupting this cross-talk with an
ER down-regulator such as fulvestrant (38). Fulvestrant is an
antiestrogen with no agonist effects that binds, blocks, and
degrades the ER. Data from clinical trials showed that fulvestrant
is at least as effective as anastrozole in the treatment of
postmenopausal women with hormone-resistant breast cancer
(12, 14, 15). In previous studies, we have shown that sequential
treatment of letrozole-resistant tumors with tamoxifen or fulvestrant was not effective in controlling tumor growth (38). In the
study shown here as in previous clinical trials (14), anastrozole was
as effective as fulvestrant in reducing tumor growth although
fulvestrant was not able to reduce growth of tumors progressing on
anastrozole treatment. Recent trials showed rather few responses,
but suggest clinical benefit (28, 29). However, only 2 of 96 patients
showed either partial or complete response (29). The limited
efficacy of fulvestrant as a single agent in second-line therapy after
aromatase inhibitor treatment may be associated with increases
in ERa expression and intratumoral aromatase activity. In fact,
tumors that received fulvestrant during 14 weeks of treatment and
showed no response also had an increase in ERa expression
when compared with control. Tumors that received anastrozole
following fulvestrant treatment showed an even higher increase in
ERa expression and aromatase activity when compared with the
fulvestrant and control groups. Previous publications have shown
that, although fulvestrant is an ER down-regulator, development of
fulvestrant resistance in MCF-7 cells is not associated with loss or
even reduction of ER expression or function (39). Clinical studies
also showed that, although fulvestrant is a potent antiestrogen,
it is not able to down-regulate ER to an undetectable level (40).
The increase in ER expression associated with the increase in
aromatase activity seen in our model may result from a mechanism
developed by the tumor cells to circumvent the long-term estrogen
deprivation. Escalation of the aromatase activity was observed

previously in in vitro model systems of long-term estrogen deprivation (41–43). Additionally, Chen and collaborators have shown
that an increase in ER expression in breast cancer cells elevates
aromatase activity (44).
Although fulvestrant as second-line therapy following anastrozole alone did not show any benefit, the addition of fulvestrant to
the anastrozole treatment significantly reduced tumor growth.
Likewise, the switch from fulvestrant to the combination therapy
was superior to fulvestrant as single agent. Previous studies have
suggested that the efficacy of fulvestrant, especially in the setting
of endocrine resistance, may be enhanced by reducing estrogen
levels by aromatase inhibitor treatment (45–47). Additionally, we
found that anastrozole plus fulvestrant given from the beginning
resulted in longer growth inhibition. We have also shown that the
combination of letrozole and fulvestrant was more effective than
either treatment alone in delaying development of resistance (38).
The positive effect of the combination of anastrozole plus fulvestrant in sequence or continuously is associated with downregulation of a refractory phenotype represented by IGF-IR,
AKT, MAPK, p-MAPK, mTOR, p-mTOR, and ERa expression. The
combination of letrozole and fulvestrant also repressed HER2
and p-MAPK expression in the tumors treated with the combination therapy compared with tumors treated with letrozole
alone (48).

In summary, the additive effects of combining aromatase
inhibitors such as anastrozole or letrozole with fulvestrant suggest
that the complete blockade of estrogen action by down-regulation
of ER and inhibition of estrogen synthesis has a greater effect on
tumor growth than either treatment strategy alone. The results also
suggest that the combination of an aromatase inhibitor and
fulvestrant may be an optimal second-line therapy for patients
with tumors progressing on a therapeutically effective dose of
aromatase inhibitor by preventing activation of growth factor
pathways (HER2 or IGF-IR) and a possible cross talk between these
pathways and ER. Several clinical trials such as SOFEA, FACT,
SWOG-S0226, FIRST, and D6997C00057 (36) are ongoing and will
contribute further information about the benefits of combining
anastrozole and fulvestrant in patients. Delay in the use of
chemotherapy by a sequential use of endocrine therapies offers
significant quality-of-life advantages due to good tolerability of the
agents, especially in elderly patients or those with advanced disease.
