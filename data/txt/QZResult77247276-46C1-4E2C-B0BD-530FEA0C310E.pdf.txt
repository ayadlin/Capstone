Abstract
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a major component of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/
AKT signaling pathway that is dysregulated in 50% of all human malignancies. Rapamycin and its analogues
(rapalogs) partially inhibit mTOR through allosteric binding to mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) but not mTOR
complex 2 (mTORC2), an emerging player in cancer. Here, we report WYE-125132 (WYE-132), a highly potent,
ATP-competitive, and specific mTOR kinase inhibitor (IC50: 0.19 ± 0.07 nmol/L; >5,000-fold selective versus
PI3Ks). WYE-132 inhibited mTORC1 and mTORC2 in diverse cancer models in vitro and in vivo. Importantly,
consistent with genetic ablation of mTORC2, WYE-132 targeted P-AKT(S473) and AKT function without significantly reducing the steady-state level of the PI3K/PDK1 activity biomarker P-AKT(T308), highlighting a
prominent and direct regulation of AKT by mTORC2 in cancer cells. Compared with the rapalog temsirolimus/CCI-779, WYE-132 elicited a substantially stronger inhibition of cancer cell growth and survival, protein
synthesis, cell size, bioenergetic metabolism, and adaptation to hypoxia. Oral administration of WYE-132 to
tumor-bearing mice showed potent single-agent antitumor activity against MDA361 breast, U87MG glioma,
A549 and H1975 lung, as well as A498 and 786-O renal tumors. An optimal dose of WYE-132 achieved a substantial regression of MDA361 and A549 large tumors and caused complete regression of A498 large tumors
when coadministered with bevacizumab. Our results further validate mTOR as a critical driver for tumor
growth, establish WYE-132 as a potent and profound anticancer agent, and provide a strong rationale for clinical development of specific mTOR kinase inhibitors as new cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 70(2); 621–31. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an unconventional serine/threonine protein kinase related to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family (1, 2). As a master
regulator of growth, mTOR resides in at least two functional
multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, mediating
diverse signals from growth factors, nutrients, and energy
supply (3–5). mTORC1 is an essential mediator of PI3K/
AKT through its direct phosphorylation of the ribosomal
protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and the eukaryotic translation
initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1). The more
recently identified mTORC2 phosphorylates the survival ki-

nase AKT and regulates the cytoskeleton network (6–8). The
positive regulation of AKT by mTORC2 implicates mTOR in
acting both upstream and downstream of AKT.
The signaling network engaged by the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
axis is frequently dysregulated in human malignancy (9–11). Although the mTOR gene locus is not known to be oncogenically
mutated or amplified in cancer, the mTOR kinase is a pivotal
downstream target of numerous oncogenic proteins, such as
PI3K, AKT, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2/
neu, and BCR-Abl. mTOR is also hyperactivated in response
to the loss of tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN, tuberous
sclerosis complex, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), and neurofibromatosis 1. A heightened level of mTOR activity, as indicated by an
elevated phosphorylation of its downstream substrates P-S6K1,
P-S6, and P-AKT, is frequently observed in clinical samples of
various solid tumors and hematopoietic malignancies. Compelling preclinical and a limited body of clinical evidence indicate that certain cancers with hyperactive PI3K/AKT/mTOR
status are particularly susceptible to mTOR inhibition.
Clinically used rapamycins (rapamycin and rapalogs)
partially inhibit mTOR through allosteric binding to the
FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain adjacent to the catalytic
site of mTORC1 (12, 13). These compounds do not directly

target mTORC2 and do not completely block all mTORC1
outputs. Although rapalog therapies have shown clinical efficacy in a subset of cancers (14–16), this mode of drug action
does not fully exploit the antitumor potential of mTOR targeting in cancer. In particular, emerging roles of mTORC2 in
hyperphosphorylation (activation) of AKT in major solid cancers are vital to tumor maintenance and progression, but
they are resistant to the rapamycins. Additionally, mTORC1
can also negatively regulate PI3K or extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK), implicating potential feedback activation of PI3K
and/or ERK/MAPK signaling by rapamycins in certain cancer
cells (10, 17). Consequently, intense efforts are now under
way to develop inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways,
including ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR (18, 19). Several recent reports have described biochemical and cellular
properties of ATP-competitive and selective inhibitors of
mTOR (20–23). These chemically distinctive compounds all
show suppression of mTORC2 substrate P-AKT(S473) and attenuate AKT downstream biomarkers. Although their anticancer activities have not been reported (20–22), these
mTOR kinase inhibitors induce a stronger suppression than
rapamycin of protein synthesis and cell growth (20, 21, 23).
We recently reported the discovery of pyrazolopyrimidine
inhibitors of mTOR (23). Extensive structure-activity relationship studies of this chemical series led to the discovery
of WYE-125132 (WYE-132), a highly potent, ATP-competitive,
and specific inhibitor of mTOR. We now report in vitro and
in vivo anticancer activity of WYE-132 in major solid tumors.
The profound anticancer activity of WYE-132 is mediated by
specific and global targeting of mTORC1 and mTORC2 without affecting the PI3K/PDK1 activity biomarker P-AKT
(T308), further establishing a fundamental role of mTOR in
tumor growth. Comparative studies highlight mechanistic
differentiation between WYE-132 and rapalog temsirolimus/CCI-779 in targeting cancer cell growth and survival,
protein synthesis, bioenergetic metabolism, and hypoxia adaptation, supporting the rationale for clinical use of specific
mTOR kinase inhibitors as new cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Inhibitors. WYE-125132, PI-103, 17-hydroxywortmannin,
and temsirolimus/CCI-779 were provided by Wyeth Discovery
Synthetic Chemistry. For in vitro studies, inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO as 20 mmol/L stocks and diluted before assays. Bevacizumab was obtained from MedWorld Pharmacy.
Kinase assays. mTOR enzyme assays via dissociationenhanced lanthanide fluorescent immunoassay (DELFIA),
ATP matrix assays, and mTOR immune-complex kinase assays were performed as described previously (24). Assays of
PI3Ks were performed (25). hSMG1 and ATR were assayed
using glutathione S-transferase–p53 as a substrate, detected
via DELFIA using an anti–P-p53 (S15) antibody. Assays of a
panel of 230 protein kinases were performed by SelectScreen
profiling (Invitrogen).
Tumor cell growth inhibition assays, protein lysates,
and immunoblotting. Cell lines of MDA-MB-361, MDA-

MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT549, LNCap, A549, H1975, H157,
H460, U87MG, A498, 786-O, HCT116, MG63, Rat1, HEK293,
and HeLa were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. PC3MM2 was described (23). Cell growth assays
and IC50 determination were described (23). For immunoblotting, cultured cells were treated as indicated. Total cell
lysates were prepared using NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate
sample buffer (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted with various
antibodies as described (23).
Assays of protein synthesis. To measure global protein
synthesis, MDA361 cells were fed with methionine-free RPMI
1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
treated with inhibitors for 3 h. Cells were then labeled
for 2 h with 1 μCi per well of L -[methyl- 3 H]methionine
(Perkin-Elmer) and assayed (26). For examination of the
cap-dependent translation initiation complex, MDA361 cells
were treated for 16 h with inhibitors. Methionine incorporation and 7methyl-GTP pull-down were performed (26, 27).
For polysome analysis, HEK293 cells were treated for 16 h
with the indicated inhibitors and analyzed (26).
Analyses of cell cycle and cell size. For cell cycle and cell
size experiments, various cells were treated for 12, 24, or 48
h with inhibitors. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed in a
Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer using CellQuest software, and mean FSC-H population was determined
as a measure of relative cell size (28). In some experiments,
cells were also analyzed on Guava PCA-96 instrument (23).
Assays of lactate and vascular endothelial growth factor
in normoxia and hypoxia. For normoxic culture measurements, confluent cells were fed with fresh medium with inhibitors for 24 h. For hypoxia response, cells were plated
overnight and fed with fresh growth medium with inhibitors
immediately before incubating without or with hypoxia (1%
O2) for 24 h. Culture supernatants were assayed for vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) using the Endogen Human
VEGF ELISA kit (Pierce Biotechnology) or lactate using the
Lactate Reagent (Trinity Biotech).
Oxygen consumption. MDA361 cells were suspended in
glucose-free DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% dialyzed FBS, treated for 1 h with inhibitors, and placed into the oxygen biosensor system (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence was measured
using Envision 2100 reader (Perkin-Elmer) at excitation/
emission of 485/630 nm every 20 min up to 5 h. The oxygen
consumption rates were calculated based on the slope within
the linear range, converted into fluorescence arbitrary unit
per minute, and normalized with total protein (29).
In vivo tumor studies. For mTOR biomarker studies, various tumors (400 mm3) grown s.c. in female nude mice were
dosed by a single i.v. or oral injection with vehicle or WYE-132
formulated in 5% ethanol, 2% Tween 80, and 5% polyethylene
glycol-400. Tumor lysates were prepared and immunoblotted
(30). For efficacy studies, nude mice bearing U87MG, MDA361,
H1975, A549, A498, or 786-O tumors were staged and randomized into treatment groups (n = 10). Mice were dosed orally
with vehicle or WYE-132 following qd x5 cycle regimen (5 d
on, 2 d off) for up to four cycles. Temsirolimus/CCI-779 was
formulated as WYE-132 and dosed i.v. once weekly. Bevacizumab was formulated in PBS and dosed i.p. via its clinical

monitored and analyzed (30).

Results
WYE-132 is a potent, specific, and ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Our efforts in the mTOR
inhibitor lead optimization led to the discovery of WYE-132, a
novel pyrazolopyrimidine substituted with a bridged morpholine (Fig. 1A; ref. 31). WYE-132 potently inhibited recombinant
mTOR (IC50: 0.19 ± 0.07 nmol/L) via an ATP-competitive

mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S1). WYE-132 was highly selective over various PI3Ks, the PI3K-related kinases hSMG1
and ATR (>5,000-fold; Fig. 1A), and was largely inactive against
a panel of 230 protein kinases (Supplementary Table S1). In
immune-complex assays, it inhibited mTORC1-dependent
phosphorylation of S6K(T389) and mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of AKT(S473) (Fig. 1B), whereas CCI-779–FKBP12
complex only inhibited mTORC1 (23). In cellular settings, PS6K(T389) and P-AKT(S473) in insulin-like growth factor-I
(IGF-I)–induced Rat1, the PIK3CA mutant MDA361, or
PTEN-null U87MG cells were dose dependently inhibited

by WYE-132 with ED50 in low nanomolar range (Fig. 1C and
D). The steady-state levels of the PI3K/PDK1 activity biomarker P-AKT(T308) were not reduced by WYE-132 in these
cells and in others (Fig. 1C and D; Supplementary Fig. S2A),
confirming its mTOR selectivity versus PI3K in cells. Notably, in MDA361 cells, WYE-132 transiently and partially reduced P-AKT(T308) at 1 hour but the level of P-AKT(T308)
recovered by 3 hours and remained uninhibited (Supplementary Fig. S2B). WYE-132 reduced AKT substrates PFKHRL1(T32) and P-GSK3(S21/9) but did not alter P-ERK/
MAPK (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S2C). These results establish WYE-132 as a potent and highly selective inhibitor
of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in vitro and in cells.
Inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and induction of apoptosis. WYE-132 is a potent antiproliferative agent against a panel of cancer cell lines with
IC50 values generally in the nanomolar range (Supplementary Table S2). In the typical 3-day dose-response studies,
WYE-132 exhibited a more profound antiproliferative activity than CCI-779 in MDA361 and other cells, as shown by
the sharper inhibition at doses up to 10 μmol/L; CCI-779
and rapalogs in general elicit a flat, modest (≤50%) suppression of cell growth (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S3A). Both
WYE-132 and paclitaxel showed, as expected, higher IC50
values after 1- or 2-day treatment than the 3-day treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of inhibitor-treated (1 μmol/L, 24
hours) MDA468, PC3MM2, U87MG, A549, and HCT116 cells
indicated that WYE-132 elicited a more profound increase
in G1-phase and a reduction in S-phase cells than CCI-779
(Fig. 2B). Strikingly, WYE-132 but not CCI-779 caused cell
death in the PI3K/mTOR- and HER2-hyperactive MDA361
cells, which was readily detectable at 24 hours and became
massive at 48 hours (Fig. 2C). The WYE-132–induced cell
death was evident at 10 and 30 nmol/L (6.2% and 13%,
respectively) and was dose dependent, reaching 47% at
1 μmol/L and 59% at 3 μmol/L (Fig. 2C, right). Immunoblotting detected apoptotic poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) cleavage in MDA361 cells treated with WYE-132
but not CCI-779 (Fig. 2D, top). WYE-132 also induced PARP
cleavage in LNCap, H1975, and BT474 cells but not in
HCT116 and HT29 cells (Fig. 2D, bottom). Notably, the induction of PARP cleavage in these cells correlated with
the loss of P-AKT(S473) but not P-AKT(T308) (Fig. 2D,
top; data not shown). We next compared WYE-132 with a
dual-pan PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 (32) in cell cycle profile and caspase activation. Whereas both inhibitors had little effect at 12-hour exposure, treatment of MDA361 for 24
hours indicated similar increases in G1 by both inhibitors
but a more profound cell death by PI-103 than WYE-132
(27% versus 12% at 5 μmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Similarly, PI-103 caused a more rapid and larger increase
in caspase-3/caspase-7 activity in MDA361 and LNCap cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). Collectively, these results indicate
that WYE-132 induces apoptosis in subsets of cancer cells
with a slower kinetics than that of PI-103.

incorporation was unaffected by 3 μmol/L CCI-779, whereas
WYE-132 at 3, 1, and 0.3 μmol/L all showed ∼50% inhibition
(Fig. 3A). mTOR promotes cap-dependent translation via
phosphorylation of 4EBP1, a repressor of the cap-binding factor eIF4E. CCI-779 partially inhibited P-4EBP1 at S65 and T70
but not at the T37/46 sites. In contrast, WYE-132 completely
inhibited phosphorylation of all four sites (Fig. 3B, left).
7
methyl-GTP pull-down analysis of the cap-initiation complex indicated that WYE-132 caused a substantially higher
increase than CCI-779 in the eIF4E-bound 4EBP1 and a complete loss of eIF4G (Fig. 3B, right), indicating a total disruption of eIF4F complex. The ratio of polysomes to 60/80S
monosomes is directly related to cellular translational activity. In an analysis with HEK293 polysomes, the polysome/
monosome ratios for cells treated with DMSO, 0.5 μmol/L
CCI-779, and 0.5 μmol/L WYE-132 were 1.62, 1.02, and 0.58,
respectively, indicating a larger reduction in polysomes by
WYE-132 than CCI-779 (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the more
effective suppression of protein synthesis, WYE-132 caused
a more profound reduction in cell size than CCI-779 (Fig. 3D,
left). The relative cell sizes (mean FSC-H) for CCI-779–treated
and WYE-132–treated renal cancer A498 cells were 97% and
83% of control, respectively (Fig. 3D, right). Collectively, these
results document a stronger suppression of protein synthesis
and cell size by WYE-132 than CCI-779.
Tumor cell metabolism and hypoxia response modulated by WYE-132. Aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer cell
metabolism that involves PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Treatment of the highly glycolytic U87MG cells led to a dosedependent and more pronounced reduction in lactate by
WYE-132 (48% of control at 1 μmol/L) than that of CCI779 (80% of control at 1 μmol/L; Fig. 4A, left). WYE-132 also
potently and acutely reduced levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, a principal regulator of glycolysis, which was
noticeably more complete than that of CCI-779 or 17-hydroxywortmannin (Fig. 4A, right). The effect of mTOR inhibition
on mitochondrial respiration was examined in MDA361 cells,
as they display a robust increase in oxygen consumption on
switching to a glucose-free, pyruvate-containing culture
medium. Oxygen consumption rate was again more strongly
reduced by WYE-132 (35% of control) than CCI-779 (82% of
control; Fig. 4B). Hypoxic stress response is important for
cancer cell survival and tumor-induced angiogenesis, which
requires HIF-1α and HIF-2α. WYE-132 was more effective
than CCI-779 in blocking the accumulation of HIF-1α and
HIF-2α in low oxygen (Fig. 4C). Accordingly, WYE-132
was more effective in blocking the hypoxia-induced lactate
(Fig. 4D, left) and hypoxia-induced VEGF (Fig. 4D, right).
Therefore, WYE-132 seems to exert a stronger effect than
CCI-779 in blocking cancer cell adaptation to hypoxia.
Inhibition of mTOR signaling and tumor growth
in PI3K/AKT/mTOR-hyperactive glioma and breast
tumor models. A single i.v. administration of 50 mg/kg
WYE-132 into tumor-bearing mice led to suppression of
P-S6K(T389) and P-AKT(S473) for at least 8 hours in
PC3MM2, MDA361, HCT116, and HT29 tumors, whereas
the steady-state level of P-AKT(T308) was not significantly
reduced (Supplementary Fig. S5), indicating that the antitumor

efficacy of WYE-132 under such dosing regimens reflects the
suppression of mTOR rather than PI3K. Oral administration of
WYE-132 caused dose-dependent tumor growth delay in the
PI3K/mTOR- and HER2-hyperactive MDA361 tumors with
significant antitumor activity at 5 mg/kg (Fig. 5A, left), which

activity and induced PARP cleavage in the early hours after
dosing (Fig. 5B, right), indicating that apoptotic tumor cell
death in vivo may contribute to tumor regression. WYE-132
also caused a potent and substantial tumor growth delay
in the PTEN-null U87MG glioma (Fig. 5C). Collectively,

these results support the idea that mTOR kinase inhibitors
may be particularly effective against subsets of tumors
bearing an oncogenically activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade.

resulting in improved animal survival (Fig. 6A). WYE-132 also dose dependently inhibited the growth of NSCLC A549
tumors, achieving a complete or nearly complete suppression at 50 and 25 mg/kg and a partial suppression at 10 mg/kg
(Fig. 6B, top). An optimal dose of WYE-132 caused a rapid and
substantial regression of large A549 tumors, which was not
achieved with a clinical regimen of CCI-779 or bevacizumab
(Fig. 6B, bottom).
Majority of the renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are characterized by the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL and stabilization of
HIF-1/2 that promotes tumor angiogenesis. CCI-779 and related rapalogs exhibit clinical efficacy in RCC, which is in part
mediated by targeting tumor angiogenesis. In vivo growth of
the RCC A498 (VHL null) tumors was only partially inhibited
by 25 mg/kg CCI-779 (five times the clinical dose) but was
completely suppressed by 25 mg/kg WYE-132 (Fig. 6C, top).
WYE-132 also completely suppressed the tumor growth of
RCC 786-O (VHL null; PTEN null; Fig. 6C, bottom). WYE-132
was tested in combination with bevacizumab in A498 for tumor regression. Bevacizumab alone or in combination with
CCI-779, at dose regimens equivalent to respective clinical
protocols, suppressed tumor growth without inducing tumor

regression. Interestingly, 50 mg/kg WYE-132 alone elicited a
significant tumor regression. Combination of WYE-132 with
bevacizumab caused a most dramatic regression so that tumors continue to shrink over the course of therapy (Fig. 6D,
top). Representative tumors on day 20 of this study are shown
(Fig. 6D, bottom). These results show that WYE-132 is more
effective than CCI-779 in the preclinical models of RCC.

Discussion
Although clinical studies with rapalogs have validated
mTOR as a cancer target, the effectiveness of these drugs
may be limited due to several pharmacologic parameters,
including the resistance of mTORC2 signaling functions and
the rebound activation of PI3K/AKT induced in certain tumor
cells. These considerations led to intensive efforts to develop
mTOR-selective kinase inhibitors that induce a deeper and
broader suppression of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities
in cancer cells. In this report, we have provided biochemical,
cellular, and in vivo evidence that WYE-132 is a highly potent,
ATP-competitive, and selective inhibitor of mTORC1 and
mTORC2. mTORC2 phosphorylates AKT S473, and dysregulated

mTORC2 contributes to the malignant phenotype (6, 33).
Phosphorylation of S473 and T308 can occur independently
(34), and genetic ablation of mTORC2 leads to selective loss
of P-AKT S473 without affecting T308 (35, 36). Likewise,
WYE-132 selectively targeted the steady-state levels of P-AKT
S473 versus T308 in diverse cancer cell lines. This property
of WYE-132 reflects a further improvement from its earlier
chemical analogues (23) and differs somewhat from other
mTOR-selective inhibitors PP242 (21) and Ku-0063794 (22)
that substantially reduced P-AKT T308 in the described cell
assay systems (21, 22). Although more detailed comparisons
of these mTOR-selective inhibitors are clearly needed, the
actions of WYE-132 are largely consistent with those predicted for a specific inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2
based on previously published genetic studies (34–36).
WYE-132 selectively and substantially attenuated AKT function in a variety of cancer cells as measured by the reduced
levels of P-FKHRL1(T32) and P-GSK3(S21/9).
WYE-132 potently inhibited proliferation of diverse cancer
cell lines with IC50 values generally in the low nanomolar
range. It was previously suggested that the strong G1 cell cycle
arrest induced by the dual-pan PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103
is attributed to the dual targeting of mTOR and PI3K (32). In

628

the present study, WYE-132 induced a strong G1 arrest in
both the CCI-779–sensitive and the CCI-779–resistant cells
at the inhibitor concentrations that do not target P-AKT
(T308), indicating a critical dependence of mTORC2 and/or
rapamycin-resistant function of mTORC1 in G1 progression.
Furthermore, WYE-132 induced a substantial apoptotic response in breast MDA361, BT474, prostate LNCap, and lung
H1975 cancer cells, all of which express hyperactive PI3K/
AKT/mTOR and/or oncogenic EGFR/HER2. It is particularly
noteworthy that although the WYE-132–induced cell death
occurred more slowly than that of PI-103, these cells underwent massive apoptosis in spite of an undiminished phosphorylation of AKT T308, underscoring a specific and
unequivocal role of mTOR in survival. These observations
not only highlight the critical importance of mTOR in growth
and cell cycle progression but also strongly suggest that subsets of PI3K/AKT/mTOR deregulated cancers are critically
dependent on mTOR for survival. These mTOR-dependent
survival effects likely involve AKT and/or the rapamycinresistant function of mTORC1.
The substantial reduction in global protein synthesis and
cell size distinguishes WYE-132 form CCI-779 and may be
relevant for its antitumor activity. Whereas mTOR regulates

cap-dependent mRNA translation (37–39), rapamycins at the
commonly studied drug concentrations do not provoke a substantial reduction in global protein synthesis. WYE-132 and
other mTOR-selective inhibitors (20, 21, 23) strongly perturbed the cap-dependent translation initiation eIF4F complex, as shown by a drastic increase in the inhibitory
binding of 4EBP1 to the cap-binding factor eIF4E and a nearly
complete loss of the scaffolding protein eIF4G. These effects
reflect in part their ability to efficiently suppress the rapamycin-resistant P-4EBP1(T37/46) (40). The stronger suppression
of initiation is also reflected by a profound loss of polysomal
fractions. Additionally, reduction in global protein synthesis
may also involve an attenuated translation elongation, as we
observed a dramatically increased phosphorylation (inactivation) of the elongation factor eEF2 T56 in the WYE-132–treated
MDA361 cells as compared with a moderate increase in CCI779–treated cells (data not shown). Further studies are needed
to elucidate additional novel function(s) of mTOR in protein
synthesis that might be resistant to rapamycin.
Hyperactive PI3K/AKT/mTOR is strongly implicated in
cancer cell metabolism, favoring bioenergetic pathways that
control cell growth and proliferation (41, 42). Compared with
CCI-779, WYE-132 more profoundly inhibited both aerobic
glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in various cancer cell
lines, establishing WYE-132 as a stronger inhibitor than CCI779 in attenuating bioenergetic metabolism. HIF-1α is a master regulator of glucose metabolism and tumor angiogenesis
in response to growth factors and hypoxia (41–43). WYE-132
and CCI-779 similarly blocked growth factor–dependent HIF1α in glioma cells and in other cell lines (data not shown).
These two inhibitors also similarly reduced VEGF levels in
the highly angiogenic glioma and prostate cells (data not
shown). These results are in line with earlier reports on antiangiogenic properties of rapalogs in cancer treatment (44, 45)
and further suggest that the growth factor–mediated HIF-1α/
VEGF primarily requires mTORC1 in these cells. Importantly,
WYE-132 but not CCI-779 strongly inhibited hypoxia-induced
accumulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Accordingly, WYE-132
more profoundly inhibited hypoxia-induced production
of lactate and VEGF. It therefore seems that global targeting
of mTOR leads to a stronger effect than the mTORC1selective CCI-779 in blocking cancer cell adaptation to
hypoxia, a key feature of the tumor microenvironment in vivo.
WYE-132 showed single-agent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models when administered at dosing regimens
that do not target the PI3K/PDK1 activity biomarker
P-AKT(T308). These observations not only show the high
specificity of WYE-132 in vivo but also highlight the critical
importance of mTOR as a driver of tumor growth in vivo.

WYE-132 was particularly effective against subsets of tumors
harboring PTEN deficiency (U87MG and 786-O), mutational
activation of PI3K p110α PIK3CA (MDA361), oncogenic
EGFR (H1975), or HER2/neu (MDA361), as well as LKB1/
STK11 deficiency with mutant K-RAS (A549). In these studies, WYE-132 potently inhibited tumor growth, and an optimal dose of WYE-132 achieved substantial regression of large
tumors, an outcome that was not observed with a clinical
regimen of CCI-779 or the anti-VEGF therapy bevacizumab.
Notably, an optimal dose of WYE-132 induced a rapid PARP
cleavage in large-size MDA361 tumors in vivo, implicating apoptotic death in tumor regression. RCC tumors are often
characterized by the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL and stabilization of HIF-1/2 (46). Rapalogs show clinical efficacy in
RCC, achieving stable disease and improvement in progression-free survival (47, 48). The rapalog efficacy in RCC is in
part mediated by targeting mTOR-dependent HIF-1/2 expression (49, 50). Importantly, we found that in vivo growth
of the VHL-null RCC A498 tumors was more profoundly
inhibited by WYE-132 than CCI-779 and that WYE-132 in
combination with bevacizumab induced a nearly complete
regression of very large tumors. These results implicate a
critical and novel role(s) of mTOR in RCC tumor growth.
In conclusion, specific and global targeting of mTOR in
cancer cells by WYE-132 has further validated essential
roles of mTOR in tumor growth, survival, protein synthesis,
and tumor metabolism. WYE-132 inhibits growth of numerous human tumor models of brain, breast, lung, and
renal cancer. The preclinical pharmacology and efficacy
of WYE-132 support its use as an anticancer agent and
provide a strong rationale for clinical development of
ATP-competitive and specific mTOR kinase inhibitors as
new anticancer therapy.
