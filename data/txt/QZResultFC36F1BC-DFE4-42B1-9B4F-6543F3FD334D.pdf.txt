BACKGROUND: Allopurinol and urate oxidase are both effective in preventing or treating hyperuricemia during
remission induction therapy for lymphoid malignancies, but to the authors’ knowledge, their effects on concomitant
anticancer drug therapy have not been compared. METHODS: The authors compared plasma methotrexate pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received concomitant allopurinol (n ¼ 20) versus those treated with nonrecombinant or recombinant urate oxidase (n ¼ 96) during high-dose
methotrexate administration before conventional remission induction therapy. RESULTS: The minimum plasma concentration of uric acid was significantly (P < .0001) lower after urate oxidase treatment than the concentration after
allopurinol treatment. Methotrexate clearance was significantly higher (median, 117.1 mL/minute/m2 vs 91.1 mL/minute/
m2; P ¼ .019) in patients who received urate oxidase. A higher proportion of patients in the allopurinol group had elevated methotrexate plasma concentrations (36% vs 7%; P ¼ .003) and experienced mucositis (45% vs 16%; P ¼ .003)
after methotrexate treatment compared with the urate oxidase group. CONCLUSIONS: The lower rate of methotrexate clearance in patients who received allopurinol likely reflected a less potent hypouricemic effect of allopurinol,
leading to precipitation of uric acid in renal tubules. Hence, during remission induction therapy for lymphoid malignancies, the authors concluded that renally excreted drugs should be monitored closely, especially in patients who

KEYWORDS: methotrexate, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hyperuricemia, allopurinol, urate oxidase.

Patients with leukemia and lymphoma are at risk of hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome before and during

chemotherapy.1,2 Hyperuricemia is caused by the rapid breakdown of nucleic acids released by tumor cell lysis. Uric
acid is relatively soluble in plasma but is poorly soluble in acidic urine. Uric acid is more likely to precipitate in the
renal tubules and impair renal function as plasma uric acid concentration increases.3 Renal insufficiency caused by
hyperuricemia, in turn, may reduce the clearance of renally excreted anticancer drugs, thereby increasing the risk of
toxicity. Historically, the standard prophylaxis or treatment of hyperuricemia in leukemia and lymphoma has included
allopurinol, urinary alkalinization, and vigorous hydration.4-6 Allopurinol, a xanthine analogue, inhibits the enzyme
xanthine oxidase, which catalyzes the hepatic conversion of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Thus, allopurinol
does not eliminate existing uric acid in plasma, which still needs to be excreted by the kidneys. Furthermore, allopurinol increases the renal load of xanthine, which is less soluble than uric acid and can cause nephropathy.7,8

The enzyme urate oxidase is an alternative agent that
has a more rapid onset of action than allopurinol.9-13
Urate oxidase is an endogenous enzyme in most mammals, but not in humans. Unlike allopurinol, urate oxidase converts uric acid to allantoin, a highly soluble
metabolite that is excreted readily by the kidneys.14 Nonrecombinant urate oxidase derived from Aspergillus flavus
has been used to treat hyperuricemia in France and Italy
for more than 3 decades but is associated with acute
hypersensitivity reactions in approximately 5% of
patients.10 The recombinant urate oxidase rasburicase
also is very effective in the prevention and treatment of
hyperuricemia and is associated with less hypersensitivity
reactions.9,11-13
The uric acid-lowering effects of allopurinol and rasburicase in children were compared previously in a
randomized study9; however, to our knowledge, the
effects of these agents on concomitant anticancer chemotherapy have not been compared in adults or in children.
In the current study, we compared the clearance and toxicity of the renally excreted drug methotrexate in children
with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) who received either allopurinol or urate oxidase for
the treatment or prophylaxis of hyperuricemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We reviewed the records of all patients with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital between December 1991 and January
2006 to identify those who received allopurinol, nonrecombinant urate oxidase, or recombinant urate oxidase
immediately before, during, or within 48 hours after the
start of high-dose methotrexate given in the ‘‘upfront window’’ before conventional remission induction therapy.
Chemotherapy
All patients in this study were treated on 1 of 3 Total
Therapy ALL protocols (Total XIIIA, Total XIIIB, or
Total XV).15-17 Patients or their parents or guardians (as
appropriate) provided informed consent to participate in
the treatment protocol. Each protocol and the study
reported here were approved by the St. Jude Institutional
Review Board. In the interest of comparability, in this
analysis, we included only patients who received intravenous, high-dose methotrexate at the same dose and schedule (1 g/m2 over 24 hours).

228

In Total XIIIA (December 1991 to August 1994),
patients received upfront, single-agent therapy with intravenous, high-dose methotrexate (1 g/m2 over 24 hours).
To prevent methotrexate toxicity, all patients received
hydration and alkalinization with NaHCO3. Leucovorin
rescue was initiated at Hour 48 after the initiation of
methotrexate therapy for a total of 5 doses at 5 mg/m2 every 6 hours. Rescue was elevated according to the protocol
if the plasma methotrexate concentration was 1.0 lM at
Hour 44 after the start of methotrexate, and leucovorin
was continued until the methotrexate plasma concentration was <0.1 lM. Four days after upfront, highdose methotrexate, all patients started remission induction therapy with prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin,
L-asparaginase, etoposide, and cytarabine.15
In Total XIIIB (August 1994 to July 1998), patients
received upfront window therapy with intravenous, highdose methotrexate (1 g/m2 over 24 hours) followed immediately by intravenous mercaptopurine. To prevent methotrexate toxicity, all patients received hydration and
alkalinization with NaHCO3. Leucovorin rescue was initiated at Hour 48 after the initiation of methotrexate for a
total of 5 doses at 10 mg/m2 every 6 hours. Rescue was elevated according to the protocol if the plasma methotrexate
concentration was 1.0 lM at Hour 44 after the start of
methotrexate, and leucovorin was continued until the methotrexate plasma concentration was <0.1 lM. Conventional
remission induction therapy with prednisone, vincristine,
daunorubicin, L-asparaginase, etoposide, and cytarabine
began 4 days after the initiation of upfront therapy.16
In Total XV, patients received upfront, intravenous, high-dose methotrexate (1 g/m2) administered
over 24 hours.17 All patients received hydration and alkalinization with NaHCO3 to prevent methotrexate toxicity. Leucovorin rescue was initiated at Hour 44 after the
start of methotrexate at a dose of 50 mg/m2 and was followed by 7 doses of 15 mg/m2 leucovorin every 6 hours.
Rescue was elevated according to the protocol if the
plasma methotrexate concentration was 0.5 lM at Hour
42 after the initiation of methotrexate therapy, and leucovorin was continued until the methotrexate plasma concentration was <0.1 lM. Four days later, all patients received
conventional remission induction therapy that included
prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asparaginase, cyclophosphamide, mercaptopurine, and cytarabine.17
Prevention and Treatment of Hyperuricemia
Patients received either allopurinol or urate oxidase for
the prevention or treatment of hyperuricemia.

MTX After Allopurinol vs Urate Oxidase/Crews et al

Allopurinol was used in the early cohort of patients when
urate oxidase was not available and in the later cohort of
patients if the individual had a history of atopic allergy,
bronchial asthma, or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency, conditions that precluded the use of urate
oxidase based on the protocol criteria. Allopurinol
100 mg/m2 per dose was given orally 3 times daily. Nonrecombinant urate oxidase (Uricozyme; Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc., Paris, France) was given as an intravenous
100 U/kg dose once daily over 30 minutes. Recombinant
urate oxidase (rasburicase; Sanofi-Aventis Inc., New
York, NY) was given as an intravenous dose at 0.1 mg/kg
to 0.2 mg/kg per dose over 30 minutes once or twice
daily. Allopurinol or urate oxidase dosing history was
obtained from medical charts and was documented
through pharmacy computer systems.
Laboratory Tests
Plasma uric acid concentrations were measured daily by
using a previously described assay.10 To block degradation
of uric acid ex vivo in patients who were receiving urate
oxidase, we maintained the temperature of specimens at
0 C to 4 C during their collection, transport, and preparation. For the uric acid assay, the lower limit of detection
was 0.5 mg/dL. Complete blood cell counts with differential and serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, calcium,
phosphorus, lactate dehydrogenase, potassium, and sodium assays were determined at least daily.
Toxicity
During upfront, high-dose methotrexate therapy, adverse
events were documented and graded prospectively using
version 2.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria. The adverse events that we considered
in this analysis were those that occurred within 14 days of
high-dose methotrexate therapy and included renal and
hepatic toxicity and mucositis.
Analysis of Methotrexate Pharmacokinetics
In the Total XIII A and B protocols, blood samples were
obtained for plasma methotrexate assay at 1 hour, 6 hours,
23 hours, 44 hours, and 68 hours after the initiation of
the 24-hour methotrexate infusion. In the Total XV protocol, blood was drawn at 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, and
42 hours after the initiation of the 24-hour methotrexate
infusion. Plasma methotrexate concentrations were measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (TDx
System; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill). The
plasma concentration-versus-time data for each metho-

trexate course were fit to a 2-compartment model by using
a Bayesian estimation algorithm with pediatric population
priors18-20 as implemented in ADAPTII (Biomedical
Simulations Resource, University of Southern California,
Los Angeles, Calif). The systemic clearance was calculated
by multiplying the volume of distribution of the central
compartment by the elimination rate constant.21 For all
patients, the plasma methotrexate concentration 42 hours
after the initiation of the high-dose methotrexate infusion
was estimated by using the concentration-versus-time
data extrapolated from the estimated pharmacokinetic
parameters.

Statistical Analysis
The chi-square test or the Fisher exact test (for small sample sizes) was used to compare presenting features at diagnosis, the proportion of patients in each treatment group
who had an Hour-42 methotrexate concentration 0.5
lM (a value that indicated delayed methotrexate clearance
and a requirement for additional intravenous fluids and
leucovorin), and the incidence of toxicity in each treatment group. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to
compare the median plasma uric acid concentration and
serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen values at baseline (ie, before allopurinol or urate oxidase administration); the median percentage change from baseline to
post-treatment (with allopurinol or urate oxidase) values
for plasma uric acid, serum creatinine, and blood urea
nitrogen; and the median methotrexate clearance of the
2 treatment groups.
For statistical analysis, a uric acid concentration of
0.4 mg/dL was used in calculations if the concentration
was below the lower limit of detection. If patients received
allopurinol or urate oxidase before they received highdose methotrexate, then the baseline laboratory values
were those determined in morning samples that were collected 2 days before the initiation of high-dose methotrexate. If patients received allopurinol or urate oxidase
during the high-dose methotrexate infusion or within 48
hours of the start of the high-dose methotrexate infusion,
then the baseline laboratory values were those determined
in morning specimens that were collected 1 day before the
initiation of high-dose methotrexate. The percentage
change of each value was calculated as (value post-treatment  baseline value/baseline value). For this calculation, the post-treatment value was the minimum value
obtained during the 5 days after the start of the high-dose
methotrexate infusion.

RESULTS
In total, 116 patients received 24-hour high-dose methotrexate infusions and received treatment or prophylaxis
for hyperuricemia. Twenty patients received allopurinol,
and 96 patients received urate oxidase (28 patients
received nonrecombinant urate oxidase and 68 patients
received rasburicase). The demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table 1.
We observed no significant differences between the 2
treatment groups in any of the demographic variables. In
the allopurinol treatment group, 9 patients were treated
on the Total XIIIA protocol, 7 patients were treated on
the Total XIIIB protocol, and 4 patients were treated on
the Total XV protocol. In the urate oxidase treatment
group, 29 patients were treated on the Total XIIIB protocol and 67 patients were treated on the Total XV protocol.

230

There were no significant differences in methotrexate
clearance, plasma levels of uric acid, or other indicators of
tumor lysis noted among the 3 protocols in this study
(P > .67). Nine patients (45%) in the allopurinol treatment group and 37 patients (39%) in the urate oxidase
treatment group were hyperuricemic at baseline.
Methotrexate clearance values in patients who
received allopurinol versus urate oxidase are depicted in
Figure 1. The median methotrexate clearance was 91.1
mL/minute/m2 (range, 40.0-161.1 mL/minute/m2) in
patients who received allopurinol versus 117.1 mL/minute/m2 (range, 30.3-205.1 mL/minute/m2) in patients
who received urate oxidase (P ¼ .019). Seven of 20
patients (35%) who received allopurinol versus 7 of 96
patients (7%) who received urate oxidase had an Hour-42
plasma methotrexate concentration 0.5 lM (P ¼ .003)
and, according to the Total XV protocol guidelines,
required an increased rescue dose of leucovorin.
Plasma uric acid was controlled well in both treatment arms. Patients who received urate oxidase were
found to have a significantly greater decrease in plasma
uric acid concentration after treatment. The median
decrease in uric acid was 89% (range, þ150% to
96.5%) in the urate oxidase group and 63% (range,

þ24% to 96%) in the allopurinol group (P ¼ .0003).
The median minimum post-treatment plasma uric acid
value was 0.4 mg/dL (range, 0.4-3.7 mg/dL) in the urate
oxidase group versus 2.2 mg/dL (range, 0.4-4.3 mg/dL)
in the allopurinol group (P ¼ .0003).
The median change from baseline value in serum
creatinine (P ¼ .77) and blood urea nitrogen (P ¼ .12)
did not differ significantly by treatment group. No patient
in either treatment group required dialysis or hemofiltration or experienced renal toxicity greater than grade 1.
Grade 1 renal toxicity was observed in 3 patients (15%) in
the allopurinol group versus 3 patients (3%) in the urate
oxidase group (P ¼ .06). The incidence of elevated bilirubin (P ¼ 1.0), or elevated alanine transferase or aspartate
transferase levels (P ¼ .32) did not differ significantly
between the 2 treatment groups. However, 15 patients in
the urate oxidase group (16%) versus 9 patients in the
allopurinol group (45%) experienced mucositis (P ¼
.003).
We also compared data from patients in each treatment group with those from 191 patients who were enrolled on Total XIIIA, Total XIIIB, and Total XV
protocols who received methotrexate but did not require
either allopurinol or urate oxidase. We observed no difference in methotrexate clearance between patients in the
urate oxidase treatment group and patients who received
no allopurinol or urate oxidase (P ¼ .088). Among the
191 patients who received neither allopurinol nor urate
oxidase, 38 patients (20%) experienced mucositis; this
incidence of mucositis did not differ significantly from
that in the urate oxidase treatment group (P ¼ .38).

DISCUSSION
Hyperuricemia caused by tumor cell lysis can be lifethreatening, requiring rapid and aggressive management
to prevent acute renal failure. In the current report, we
have summarized the St. Jude experience with nonrecombinant and recombinant urate oxidase versus allopurinol in patients with newly diagnosed ALL and compared
the effects of each treatment on the clearance of methotrexate, a renally excreted agent. Our finding that urate
oxidase has a greater hypouricemic effect than allopurinol
corroborates findings from previous studies.9,10 In our
earlier study, we observed a greater and more rapid
decrease in blood uric acid levels in 134 children with
acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma who
received nonrecombinant urate oxidase than in a similarly
treated historic control group of 129 patients who
received allopurinol.10 None of the patients who received
Cancer

urate oxidase required hemodialysis, whereas >20% of
our patients with advanced-stage Burkitt lymphoma or
leukemia who were treated historically with allopurinol
did require hemodialysis.22,23 Similarly, only 2.6% of
children with advanced-stage Burkitt lymphoma or leukemia who were treated on the French LMB-89 malignant
lymphoma protocol and received nonrecombinant urate
oxidase required hemodialysis24 compared with 16% of
patients who received the identical chemotherapeutic regimen but received allopurinol on the United Kingdom
Children’s Cancer Study Group 9003 protocol.25 Subsequently, in a compassionate-use trial of rasburicase, Jeha
et al26 observed that 3% of 1069 rasburicase-treated adult
and pediatric patients required hemodialysis, whereas at
least 16% of historic control patients who received other
agents required hemodialysis.
Methotrexate is excreted primarily by the renal
route. Renal dysfunction can cause delayed methotrexate
elimination, which can result in a marked increase in hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity and may delay
subsequent therapy. In 1991, we began pharmacodynamic studies of methotrexate as it was given before conventional remission induction therapy in patients with
newly diagnosed ALL; allopurinol was used initially to
prevent or treat hyperuricemia.15-17,27 Because of the
effects of allopurinol on purine biosynthesis, which confounded our interpretation of the pharmacodynamics of
methotrexate,28 we replaced allopurinol with urate oxidase in 1994. However, some patients were not able to
receive urate oxidase because of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or a history of severe allergy
(exclusion criteria for urate oxidase treatment based on
the protocol criteria) and therefore these individuals
served as a comparison group in this study. We observed
that the patients who received allopurinol had a significantly lower median methotrexate clearance and were
more likely to experience methotrexate-induced mucositis
than the patients who received urate oxidase. The methotrexate clearance and the rate of mucositis in patients who
received urate oxidase actually were comparable to those
in patients who did not require urate oxidase or allopurinol. The decrease in methotrexate clearance in patients
who received allopurinol may be explained by a weaker
hyporuricemic effect of allopurinol, leading to precipitation of uric acid in renal tubules. Hence, during remission
induction therapy for lymphoid malignancies, renally
excreted drugs should be monitored closely, especially in
patients who are receiving allopurinol for prophylaxis or
treatment of hyperuricemia.
