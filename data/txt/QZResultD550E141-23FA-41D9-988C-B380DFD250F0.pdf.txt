BACKGROUND: In a broad patient population with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), enrolled in an open-label,
expanded access program (EAP), the safety profile of sunitinib was manageable, and efficacy results were encouraging. Here, the authors report results for patients with baseline brain metastases participating in this global EAP.
METHODS: Previously treated and treatment-naive metastatic RCC patients 18 years received sunitinib 50 mg orally,
once daily, on Schedule 4/2. Safety was assessed regularly, tumor measurements done per local practice, and survival
data collected where possible. Analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population, consisting of
all patients who received 1 dose of sunitinib. RESULTS: As of December 2007, 4564 patients had enrolled in 52
countries. Of these enrollees, 4371 were included in the modified ITT population, of whom 321 (7%) had baseline brain
metastases and had received a median of 3 treatment cycles (range 1-25). Reasons for their discontinuation included
lack of efficacy (32%) and adverse events (8%). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were
fatigue and asthenia (both 7%), thrombocytopenia (6%), and neutropenia (5%), the incidence of which were comparable to that for the overall EAP population. Of 213 evaluable patients, 26 (12%) had an objective response. Median
progression-free survival and overall survival were 5.6 months (95% CI, 5.2-6.1) and 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.8-10.9),
respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with brain metastases from RCC, the safety profile of sunitinib was comparable to that in the general metastatic RCC population, and sunitinib showed evidence of antitumor activity. Cancer

The treatment paradigm of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed by the regulatory approval of 6
new agents in 4 years. This is in contrast to the prior 2 decades when there were no new medication approvals for this indication. New targeted therapies
namely, angiogenesis inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors
have
shown superior response rates as well as progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), compared with that of
the previous era of cytokine therapy. Sunitinib malate (SUTENT, Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) is an oral, multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor
receptors, and other RTKs with direct antitumor and antiangiogenic activity.1-5 It is currently approved worldwide for
first- and second-line treatment of advanced RCC.
Sunitinib demonstrated single-agent activity in 2 phase II trials of patients with cytokine-refractory metastatic
RCC,6,7 which led to the design and conduct of a randomized, phase III trial of sunitinib compared with interferon-alfa
(IFN-a) in 750 treatment-naı̈ve patients with metastatic RCC.8 Sunitinib showed superior efficacy over IFN-a, with an
investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) of 37% vs 9% (P < .001) and median PFS of 11 months vs 4 months,
respectively (P < .001), establishing sunitinib as a reference standard of care. In addition, median OS with sunitinib was

greater than 2 years (26.4 months) compared with 21.8
months with IFN-a (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.821, 95%
CI, 0.673-1.001; P ¼ .051).
Recently, Gore et al (2009) reported results from an
open-label, expanded access program (EAP) with sunitinib for more than 4500 patients with metastatic RCC
from 52 countries.9 This trial enrolled patients who were
ineligible for sunitinib clinical trials (eg, those with brain
metastasis, poor functional status, or the elderly) and were
from countries where regulatory approval had not yet
been granted. The authors found that, in this broader
population of patients with metastatic RCC, the safety
profile of sunitinib was manageable and efficacy results
were encouraging, particularly in subgroups not typically
enrolled in clinical trials.
One such subgroup is the 10%-20% of patients
with metastatic RCC who have brain metastases10,11 who
have a life expectancy of approximately 4 to 6 months
without systemic therapy.12 In general, RCC patients
with brain metastasis typically experience a poorer outcome after medical intervention than patients presenting
with other sites of metastases. For example, in a retrospective analysis by Kavolius et al (1998)13 of 94 RCC patients
with a solitary metastasis surgical resection of a lung metastasis (n ¼ 50 patients) was associated with a significant 3fold increase in 5-year survival rate over surgical resection
of a brain metastasis (n ¼ 11; 54% vs 18%, respectively;
P < .05).
Surgical resection of brain metastases has been associated with a median OS of 12.6 months; however, this
survival benefit decreases to as low as 7.6 months and 3.0
months in patients with multiple brain metastases and
cerebellar metastases, respectively.14
In addition, RCC is often considered a radioresistant malignancy, with radiotherapy typically reserved for
palliation of bone disease. Median survival after radiotherapy of brain metastases has been only 3 to 4 months,15
with no additional benefit gained from radiotherapy after
surgical resection.14 Stereotactic radiosurgery in highly
selected populations with either a good performance score
or a limited number of brain metastases (eg, 5 metastases) has been associated with 1- and 3-year survival rates of
40% and 16%, respectively.16,17
RCC patients with brain metastasis were excluded
from the sunitinib regulatory phase III trial18; however,
anecdotal case reports of patients with brain metastases
experiencing antitumor activity while on sunitinib have
been observed.19-21 In addition, such activity is not unexpected or surprising because animal studies have shown

502

that both sunitinib and its active metabolite penetrate the
central nervous system (although there is rapid clearance
and no apparent accumulation).22
This report describes the clinical safety and efficacy
observed in patients with brain metastases who received
sunitinib treatment as part of the global metastatic RCC
EAP.9

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This is an ongoing, international, open-label EAP of
sunitinib in patients with metastatic RCC, which has
completed accrual from 246 centers in 52 countries, as
previously reported.9 The first patient was enrolled in
June 2005 and the last patient in December 2007. The
study population comprises patients 18 years with histologically confirmed metastatic RCC (of all histological
subtypes) and includes both previously treated and treatment-naı̈ve RCC patients with adequate organ function.
Additional eligibility criteria, including the potential to
derive clinical benefit from sunitinib treatment as judged
by the investigator, were previously reported.9
The EAP was approved by the institutional review
board (IRB) or independent ethics committee (IEC) at
each participating center and conducted according to the
International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients gave written informed
consent.
Study Design and Treatment
Sunitinib capsules were provided by Pfizer Inc. and orally
self-administered at a starting dose of 50 mg once daily,
without regard to meals, in repeated 6-week cycles of 4
weeks on treatment, followed by 2 weeks off (Schedule 4/
2). Dose reductions to 37.5 mg/day and then to 25 mg/
day were permitted on the basis of individual patient tolerability. All patients began treatment on Schedule 4/2,
but could be placed on a daily continuous dose upon dose
reduction at the investigator’s discretion. Patients received
sunitinib until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
or consent withdrawal. Palliative radiotherapy to specific
sites of disease was permitted (except to target lesions), per
the protocol, if considered medically necessary by the
treating physician. In such cases, sunitinib was interrupted
during palliative radiotherapy, stopping one day before
and resuming treatment one day after.
Study Assessments
The primary objective was to provide access to sunitinib
for patients who were ineligible for participation in

sunitinib clinical trials, but who had the potential of deriving clinical benefit as judged by the investigator. Secondary objectives included assessment of safety and efficacy
parameters ORR, PFS, and OS.
Disease assessment and physical examination were
done at screening, where safety and tolerability (using
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE], version 3.0), concomitant medication use, biochemistry, and hematology
were also assessed.

Collection of safety data was outlined in the protocol, with toxicity assessed on days 1, 14, and 28 of cycle 1,
and on days 1 and 28 of subsequent cycles. Adverse events
were graded according to NCI CTCAE, version 3.0, and
the association between adverse events and sunitinib therapy was assessed by the investigator.
No specific schedule or type of tumor assessments
were mandated in the protocol. Instead, tumor assessments were done per local standard pattern of care for
RCC, and data on response, PFS, and OS were collected

where possible. ORR was defined as the number of complete and partial responses according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).23 PFS was
defined as the time from start of therapy to disease progression or death from any cause. OS was defined as the
time from start of therapy to death from any cause (with
survival times censored at last follow-up for patients
remaining alive).
Statistical Evaluation
Consistent with the nature of expanded-access trials, sample size was not predetermined, no inferential analyses
were planned, and no hypotheses were tested. Safety and
efficacy data were analyzed for all patients receiving at
least 1 dose of sunitinib (a modified intention-to-treat
population) by the data cutoff date. ORR was calculated
with the corresponding 95% 2-sided CI, using standard
methods of binomial distribution. Estimates of median
PFS and OS were derived using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and 95% CI was calculated with standard methods for a fixed-sample, single-stage design. All statistical
analysis was done using SAS version 9.1.1.

RESULTS
Patients
A total of 4564 advanced RCC patients had been enrolled
as of December 2007. Data for safety, treatment duration,
tumor response, and survival were available for 4371
patients as of March 2008, the time of data cutoff. Brain
metastases were present at baseline in 321 of these
patients, and it is these patients that are described in this
report.
The baseline characteristics of patients with brain
metastases were comparable to that of the overall EAP
population (Table 1): most patients had clear-cell histology (92%), the majority had undergone prior nephrectomy (88%), and few had received prior antiangiogenic
therapy (12%).
Treatment
The median number of treatment cycles in patients with
brain metastases was 3 (range, 1-25), whereas the overall
EAP population (4371 patients) received a median of 5
cycles (range, 1-25).9 The median durations of follow-up
for patients with brain metastases and the overall EAP
population were 7.3 months (range, <1-26.0) and 11.6
months (range, <1-28.0),9 respectively.

504

In patients with brain metastases, sunitinib doses
were reduced from 50 mg/day to 37.5 mg/day in 85
patients (26%), with additional reductions to 25 mg/day
in 32 patients (10%). (Two additional patients were
assigned to and received 37.5 mg/day as a starting dose.)
Further reduction to 12.5 mg/day, although not allowed
in the protocol, occurred in 3 patients (1%). Comparative
dose reductions in the overall EAP population to 37.5
mg/day occurred in 1446 patients (33%), with further
reductions to 25 mg/day in 586 patients (13%) and to
12.5 mg/day in 18 patients (<1%).9 The mean relative
dose intensity was similar between the two groups: 93%
(SD 20) in patients with brain metastases and 95% (SD
25) in the overall EAP population.9
Fifty-two patients with brain metastases remained
on study as of March 2008, whereas 229 patients (71%)
had discontinued treatment. Reasons for discontinuation
of therapy in patients with brain metastases and the overall
EAP population9 included lack of efficacy (32% vs 27%,
respectively), death (16% vs 17%), adverse events (both
8%), consent withdrawal (both 6%), lost to follow-up

Safety
In patients with brain metastases, the most commonly
reported treatment-related nonhematological adverse
events were diarrhea (34%), fatigue (32%), nausea (29%),
and mucosal inflammation (27%), most of which were of
grade 1/2 severity (Table 2). The most common grade 3/4

adverse events included thrombocytopenia (6%), neutropenia (5%), and anemia (4%).
There were no observed differences in toxicity in
patients with brain metastases and the overall EAP population, with the overall incidence of any-grade treatmentrelated adverse events occurring in 92% of patients, regardless of the presence of brain metastases. Moreover, the
incidence of grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events in
patients with brain metastases was comparable, if not lower,
to that of the overall EAP population (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION
The analysis reported here provides evidence that the
safety profile for sunitinib in patients with brain metastases is comparable to that of the general metastatic RCC

Patients Without Brain
Metastases (n54029)

Efficacy
Of 321 patients with brain metastases, 213 (66%) were
evaluable for tumor response. One patient had a complete
response and 25 (12%) had a partial response for an ORR
of 12% (Table 3), compared with an ORR of 17% in the
overall population.9 Of the 213 evaluable patients, 111
(52%) were reported to have had stable disease for at least
3 months, resulting in a clinical benefit rate of 64%.
Median PFS in patients with brain metastases was
5.6 months (95% CI, 5.2-6.1; Table 4; Fig. 2), whereas
median PFS was 10.9 months (95% CI, 10.3-11.2) in the
overall EAP population.9 Similarly, median OS was 9.2
months (95% CI, 7.8-10.9) in patients with brain metastases (Table 4; Fig. 2), compared with 18.4 months (95%
CI, 17.4-19.2) in the overall EAP population.9 Median
PFS and OS were similar, regardless of prior cytokine
treatment status in those patients with brain metastases
reported here (Table 4). This lack of impact of prior cytokine therapy on efficacy was also observed in the overall
EAP population.9

Patients With Brain
Metastases (n5320)

One patient with brain metastases experienced a
treatment-related cerebral hemorrhage, which was mild in
severity (grade 1/2). Three patients experienced treatment-related convulsions, 2 patients with grade 1/2 severity and 1 patient with grade 3/4 severity. One patient had
grade 1/2 treatment-related partial seizure. The decision
to assign treatment-related causality to convulsions and
seizures was made exclusively by the investigator(s).
Treatment-related hypothyroidism was reported in 10
patients (3%), 8 of whom reported symptoms of grade 1/2
severity. In comparison, 6% of patients within the overall
EAP population had treatment-related hypothyroidism,9
although routine testing of thyroid function was not
required so incidence may have been higher. Twelve patients
with brain metastases suffered treatment-related cardiac disorders (4%), of whom one patient had grade 3/4 congestive
cardiac failure and one had grade 5 cardiac failure.
Sixty-five patients (20%) with brain metastases died
on study (or within 28 days of their last dose) and 128
(40%) died during follow-up; 522 (12%) in the overall
EAP population died on study and 1379 (32%) died during follow-up.9

and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome,
appear to be unfounded in this trial. Notably, only 1
patient with brain metastases experienced treatmentrelated grade 1/2 cerebral hemorrhage. In addition, 4
patients experienced treatment-related convulsions, only
one of which was of grade 3/4 severity.
Similar rates of dose modification and discontinuation because of adverse events, when compared with the
overall EAP population, provide additional evidence that

sunitinib therapy is well tolerated in this subpopulation.
However, because of the nature of expanded access trials,
these data must be interpreted with caution because some
omissions in data reporting may have occurred. It should
also be noted that the protocol specified that patients were
to receive sunitinib until disease progression; however,
some patients received treatment after progression, which
could have confounded the results.
The degree of clinical benefit observed with sunitinib in this trial in patients with brain metastases from
RCC was less than that reported with sunitinib in prior
studies,6-8 which was expected. The median OS of 9.2
months observed with sunitinib in this trial, however,
compares favorably with historical survival data for
untreated RCC patients with brain metastases (ie, a life
expectancy of 4 to 6 months12). In addition, the ORR of
12% was considerably higher than the ORR of 4%
recently reported for sorafenib in patients with metastatic
RCC and brain metastases in an expanded-access study.26
This may have important implications, as sorafenib treatment itself has been shown to reduce the occurrence of
brain metastases.27
This report is supportive of sunitinib having clinical
activity in patients with brain metastases from RCC.
However, because assessment of response was not mandated in the protocol (an acknowledged limitation in this
trial9), the reporting of response may have been inconsistent and, thus, may have negatively biased our efficacy
reporting. Furthermore, response in cerebral tumors with
angiogenesis inhibitors can be difficult to assess, and
brain-specific tumor response measures were not used in
this trial. Taken together, these factors may have impacted
the ORR reported here for this subset of patients. In addition, no data are available regarding the number of
patients who had prior irradiation of brain metastases or
who received palliative radiotherapy while on the study.
Therefore, further investigation is warranted.
RCC patients with brain metastases have limited
treatment options. The encouraging efficacy and tolerability data shown in this report demonstrate that RTK
inhibitors may have a role to play, along with surgery,
radiotherapy, or palliative therapy. Sunitinib can be safely
administered to these patients and offers them a viable
treatment alternative. Therefore, further prospective
investigation of the activity of sunitinib in patients with
brain metastases from RCC is warranted. For example, an
ongoing multicenter phase II trial in France is assessing
ORR in the brain after sunitinib treatment in RCC
patients with previously untreated or recurrent brain me-

508

tastases after radiotherapy or surgery.28 Currently, there
are several prospective trials of sunitinib in patients with
gliomas, meningiomas, and also the rare genetic syndrome
von Hippel-Lindau disease (in which patients are prone to
RCC and cerebellar hemangioblastomas). Sunitinib is
also being investigated in prospective trials of patients
with metastatic brain tumors from several other primary
tumor sites, such as metastatic lung cancer.29 Preliminary
results of these prospective trials have been reported, but
detailed results are awaited. In addition, sunitinib is being
investigated in combination with radiation therapy for
patients with primary and metastatic malignancies of the
central nervous system.30
In conclusion, sunitinib therapy in metastatic brain
disease from RCC is an additional treatment option in
patients whose previous treatment armamentarium was
severely limited. However, use of sunitinib in metastatic
RCC patients with brain metastases may require future
prospective randomized trials.
