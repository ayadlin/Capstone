ABSTRACT
The selection of therapeutic targets is a critical aspect of antibody-drug conjugate
research and development. In this study, we applied computational methods to select
candidate targets overexpressed in three major breast cancer subtypes as compared
with a range of vital organs and tissues. Microarray data corresponding to over 8,000
tissue samples were collected from the public domain. Breast cancer samples were
classified into molecular subtypes using an iterative ensemble approach combining
six classification algorithms and three feature selection techniques, including a novel
kernel density-based method. This feature selection method was used in conjunction
with differential expression and subcellular localization information to assemble a
primary list of targets. A total of 50 cell membrane targets were identified, including
one target for which an antibody-drug conjugate is in clinical use, and six targets
for which antibody-drug conjugates are in clinical trials for the treatment of breast
cancer and other solid tumors. In addition, 50 extracellular proteins were identified as
potential targets for non-internalizing strategies and alternative modalities. Candidate
targets linked with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition were identified by
analyzing differential gene expression in epithelial and mesenchymal tumor-derived
cell lines. Overall, these results show that mining human gene expression data has
the power to select and prioritize breast cancer antibody-drug conjugate targets, and
the potential to lead to new and more effective cancer therapeutics.

on cell surface proteins, the binding of which leads to
ADC internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis,
and subsequent release of the cytotoxic payload inside
tumor cells [6]. The choice of therapeutic target is a
critical success factor in this endeavor [7].
The computational selection of therapeutic targets
is a multifaceted process that generally starts with mRNA
or protein quantitative analysis to identify targets that are
overexpressed in tumor cells. Depending on the type of
target and the chosen drug and delivery strategy, candidates
are then prioritized using various approaches [8–11].
These approaches include filtering based on subcellular
localization, molecular interactions and network modeling,
analysis of scientific literature and patents, association of
expression with survival, genotype-phenotype analysis, and
integration of knowledge from drug and clinical databases.

INTRODUCTION
Personalized cancer therapies are expected to
be more effective than conventional treatment and to
minimize detrimental effects on normal cells [1]. Different
strategies have been used in the development of cancer
therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) including
direct and immune-mediated cell killing, and targeting of
the tumor neovasculature [2]. To improve clinical efficacy
and to overcome some limitations of first generation
mAb-based therapeutics, the industry is currently shifting
towards innovative and more powerful modalities such
as bi-specific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates
(ADCs) [3, 4]. Antibody-drug conjugates offer the ability
to deliver potent cytotoxic drugs specifically to tumor cells
[5]. Most current ADC development efforts are focusing

The main criterion for ADC target selection is tumor
specificity, to avoid toxicity in vital organs and tissues [7,
12]. To evaluate this property using gene expression data,
the analysis of “as many samples as possible” is necessary
given the naturally important phenotypic variation within
and between individuals [13] and additional noise resulting
from sample handling and other experimental procedures
[14]. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [15] is a major
functional genomics data repository, currently offering
public access to over 100,000 samples analyzed with the
Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip
[16]. Compiling homogeneous, reliable information using
variably granular, semi-structured sample annotations is
difficult, while critical for the overall quality of findings in
studies reusing public gene expression data [17]. A GEO
metadata SQL database was created in 2008 [18], which
made records amenable to programmatic analysis. Although
sample annotations provide a basis for analysis, various
technical problems such as inaccuracy in receptor testing
[19] or a low percentage of tumor cells may affect the
relevance of a given sample to a given class. Classification
techniques [20] are thus essential to validate and refine
annotation-based class labels.
Feature selection is another critical aspect of
computational target selection. In a recent review, Saeys
et al. [21] divided bioinformatics feature selection
techniques into three categories depending on if and how
the feature search is combined with the classification
model. The most common approach to select features in
microarray data consists in ranking and filtering features
using the Student t-test [22] or the analysis of variance
(ANOVA) F-test [23]. Limma, a popular software package
used for differential expression analysis, fits a linear model
to expression data for each gene, and variance estimates
are adjusted by borrowing information across genes [24,
25]. Problems associated with parametric methods include
distributional assumptions and the dependence of p-values
on sample size [26, 27]. Another class of supervised
feature selection techniques makes use of weights acquired
in the construction of classifiers such as random forests
[28] or support vector machines [29]. These methods,
though very effective, do not yield representations
that are directly interpretable. In this paper, we used
the coefficient of overlap of kernel densities, a concept
previously used in social statistics [30], adapted here using
a locally adaptive form of the kernel density estimate [31,
32], as a bioinformatics feature selection algorithm. The
algorithm is easy to interpret, does not depend on sample
size, accommodates various distributions, and is shown to
perform equally or better than the above methods in breast
cancer and tumor-derived cell line classification problems.
In this study, we have applied feature selection and
classification methods to identify candidate therapeutic
targets in breast cancer, the most common cancer in women
and a heterogeneous disease in nature [33]. Breast cancer
is categorized in three basic therapeutic groups associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with distinct molecular subtypes, based on the status of the
estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR),
and the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (ERBB2,
a.k.a. HER2) [34]. Although further subdivisions could
have been made in each group, we focused our analysis on
the molecular subtypes associated with these three basic
therapeutic groups (luminal, HER2+ and triple-negative).
Over 4,500 breast cancer samples were collected and
classified into these three molecular subtypes. For the
selection of candidate ADC targets overexpressed in each
breast cancer subtype, differential gene expression analysis
was performed against over 3,500 samples from a range of
vital organs and tissues. Although ADC strategies generally
rely on their internalization by cancer cells, a recent report
[35] suggests that non-internalizing ADCs targeting the
tumor microenvironment may also be effective. For this
reason, and also to provide candidate targets for alternative
modalities such as antibody-radionuclide conjugates [36],
we included both cell surface and extracellular proteins
in the analysis. We also aimed to prioritize targets linked
with metastasis, since this is the main cause of mortality
in patients with solid tumors including breast cancer [37].
Metastasis involves a series of steps where specific tumor
cells break through the basement membrane and invade
subjacent stromal cell layers, and traverse the endothelium
into blood microvessels where they travel to and infiltrate
distant sites [38]. The first step in this series of events
involves phenotypic changes in subpopulations of cells
at the invasive margins of carcinomas, which acquire
traits that are important for motility and dissemination, a
conversion called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) [39]. Resistance to therapy and recurrence have
been linked with stem cell properties of mesenchymal cells
including self-renewal, motility, resistance to apoptosis,
cell cycle arrest, suppression of immune responses and
enhanced drug transport [40, 41]. Many of the phenomena
surrounding EMT and metastasis have been studied in cell
line models [42, 43]. Here, we performed classification and
differential gene expression analysis in a large collection of
tumor-derived cell lines [44, 45], to further prioritize targets
linked with the mesenchymal phenotype and metastasis.

RESULTS
Our approach for target selection and prioritization
is schematized in Figure 1. In brief, breast cancer
samples were classified into three molecular subtypes.
Differential gene expression analysis was performed
against normal tissues to identify genes overexpressed in
each subtype. Subcellular localization information was
used in conjunction with gene expression data to select
a primary list of cell surface and extracellular candidate
targets. In parallel, differential gene expression analysis
was performed in epithelial against mesenchymal tumorderived cell lines to identify, among selected targets, those
also potentially linked with EMT.

methods, two classification methods, and six increasing
number of features). Labels assigned with high confidence
(>95% of votes) by the ensemble of experts were fed back
into the data and used for subsequent feature selection
and training of the classifiers. Complete convergence was
achieved after 15 iterations. At this point, 5,107 samples
were assigned class labels unanimously among experts
(100% of votes), and 70 samples were assigned class
labels with high confidence (>95% of votes). An additional
82 samples were labeled with reasonable confidence
(>75% of votes), and 120 samples were left unlabeled.
As a final result, a total of 5,259 samples were labeled,
in the following classes: 549 normal, 3,085 luminal, 479
HER2+ and 1,146 triple-negative breast cancer. Among
labeled samples, 4,808 (91%) retained original labels
assigned using sample annotations and receptor status.
Figure 3 shows representative gene expression of markers
used for classification in the above classes. The top 64
genes for each of six binary classification problems were
selected and hierarchical clustering was performed within
each class, and within two groups of genes, the first one
consisting of features used for the binary classification
problems involving breast cancer against normal samples,
(Figure 3, top gene dendrogram), and the second group
comprising genes used for classification problems
involving breast cancer molecular subtypes (Figure 3,
lower gene dendrogram). Distinct gene clusters with low
and high expression characteristic of each class are clearly
visible.

Breast samples (total of 5,379) were initially
assigned to one of four classes: normal, luminal, HER2+
and triple-negative, based on sample annotations and
receptor status. Class labels were validated using
repeated cross-validation combining three feature
selection methods, six classification algorithms and
two multiclass classification strategies (Figure 2). The
performance of all approaches was compared using
analysis of variance. The kernel-based feature selection
technique slightly surpassed the other two algorithms
(p<1E-3). The other factors (multiclass classification
strategy, classification algorithm and number of features)
all affected performance (p<1E-10). The accuracy under
one-against-one (OAO) classification was higher than
under one-against-all (OAA) classification. The best
performing classification algorithms were: support vector
machines (SVM), random forests (RFO) and bagging,
followed by k-nearest neighbors (KNN), J48 and naïve
Bayes. Accuracy increased as the number of features
increased in ( 2 )k =1 and remained relatively stable

expression patterns in respect to four major gene clusters.
These groups of cell lines were assigned the following
class labels: epithelial (10), mesenchymal (23), mixed
(12), melanoma (8) and leukemia (6) (Supplementary
Data, Table S1). Class labels were validated using repeated
cross-validation (Figure 4). The accuracy for each
combination of factors was similar to that obtained in the
classification of breast samples, although in this case the
three feature selection methods performed equally well,
and the best performing classification algorithms were
SVM and KNN, followed by naïve Bayes, RFO, bagging
and J48. Classification accuracy was close to 100% for
the two best performing classification algorithms in
combination with the three feature selection methods, with

three unlabeled replicates, three feature selection methods,
two classification methods, and six increasing number of
features). In this case, convergence was achieved after
seven iterations. At this point, 266 of the initially unlabeled
cell lines were assigned class labels unanimously among
experts (100% of votes), and six cell lines were assigned
class labels with high confidence (>95% of votes). An
additional 20 cell lines were labeled with reasonable
confidence (>75% of votes), and the remaining 8 cell lines
were left unlabeled. Of the total 359 cell lines, 108 were
labeled as epithelial, 88 as mixed, 66 as mesenchymal, 15
as melanoma and 74 as leukemia (Supplementary Data,
Table S2). Representative gene expression of markers
used for classification in the above cell lines classes
is shown in Figure 5. The top 64 genes for each of ten
binary classification problems were selected, hierarchical
clustering was performed within each class, and within

DISCUSSION

following terms: “extracellular matrix”, “extracellular
space” or “secreted”. To identify genes overexpressed
in cancer, gene expression in breast cancer samples was
compared with gene expression in normal tissues. For
each breast cancer molecular subtype (luminal, HER2+
and triple-negative), genes were ordered according
to the mean rank of differential expression in cancer
versus normal tissues, and the top 50 membrane and
extracellular protein-coding genes were retained
(Tables 1 and 2). Batch effects were evaluated using
series (experiments) as a surrogate, and were found to
be random and relatively inert as compared with the
tissue and status effects (Supplementary Data, Figures
S1 and S2). Epithelial and mesenchymal marker genes
were identified by comparing gene expression in
corresponding cell line classes, and filtering genes with
a differential expression ratio greater than 2 or smaller
than 0.5, and an overlap of kernel densities smaller than
0.6. Four membrane and 13 extracellular targets were
also in the mesenchymal gene set (Tables 1 and 2).

“Ideal” targets, with very high expression in one or
more tumor types and very low expression in all normal
tissues are rare. The best example of such targets is ERBB2,
which is incidentally the only target for which an ADC
(trastuzumab emtansine) is currently commercialized for
the treatment of breast cancer [51]. In this study, to select
candidate ADC targets, we performed gene expression
analysis in three breast cancer subtypes versus a range of
normal organs and tissues. Our results show that metadata
mining and sample classification are instrumental in
the assembly of large datasets representative of patient
populations, and that feature selection methods and the
incorporation of biological knowledge are essential for the
selection of clinically relevant targets. Although currently
available ADC target data may be too scarce for a formal
discussion about sensitivity and specificity, the selection
of targets for which ADCs are in clinical development is
nevertheless a good indicator of the validity of our approach.

Our list of cell membrane candidates contained one
target for which an ADC is already in clinical use and six
additional targets for which antibody-drug conjugates
are in clinical trials for the treatment of breast cancer
and other solid tumors (Table 3). Combining a recent
review on ADCs in clinical trials [52] and a search of
the ClinicalTrials.gov database [53, 54] revealed that
our list of cell membrane targets contained the majority
of target antigens for ADCs in clinical development for
the treatment of breast cancer, with the possible exception
of the tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2
(TACSTD2), a recently identified ADC target for triplenegative breast cancer [55]. In our analysis, we found that
this target, although displaying a high level of expression
in breast cancer, also had a relatively high expression
in a number of normal organs and tissues including
the skin, lungs, and kidneys and did not score high for

this reason. According to the list presented in [6], the
only candidate target in our list for which an ADC was
previously discontinued is mucin-1 (MUC1), for lack
of efficacy in ovarian cancer therapy [56, 57]. Clinical
efficacy, however, does not depend only on the selected
target but also on the design and components of the ADC
(drug, linker and antibody). In fact, there is still interest
in MUC1: an ADC targeting a specific glycol-epitope of
MUC1 (SAR-566658), as well as an anti-MUC1 chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy are currently in
clinical trials [54]. Other selected targets in clinical trials
for CAR T cell therapy, an approach that also requires
highly tumor-specific targets [58–60], include ERBB2,
mucin-16 (MUC16), prominin 1 (PROM1) and the
prolyl endopeptidase FAP (FAP) [54]. Overall, the high
proportion of clinically relevant targets suggests that our
target selection method is valid and that our list of targets

may contain new candidates with a high potential for ADC
development. A number of these are at various stages of
pre-clinical research and development, which further
validates our findings. Selected examples are discussed
below, with a focus on triple-negative breast cancer.
Targeted therapies are currently unavailable for
the treatment of triple-negative cancer, and patients in
this group have a generally poorer prognosis [61]. Of
the cell membrane targets in our list, MUC16 and the
cancer/testis antigen 83 (CT83) had the most interesting
profiles with high expression in triple-negative tumors
and lower expression in all normal tissues examined. An
ADC against MUC16 is in development by Genentech,
primarily for the treatment of ovarian cancer [62]. CT83,
on the other hand, is to our knowledge absent from current
ADC development pipelines and has only been recently
identified as a potential target in lung cancer [63]. Other
genes with high differential expression ratio in triplenegative tumors versus all normal tissues included FAP,
the disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing
protein 12 (ADAM12) and the low density lipoprotein
receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8). FAP is a membrane
protein of the serine protease family involved in the

proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, which contributes
to invasiveness in malignant cancers [64, 65]. In xenograft
models, FAP5-DM1 induced long-lasting inhibition of
tumor growth and complete regressions in different solid
tumors with no detectable side effects [66]. LRP8 has
only been recently identified as a potential target in triplenegative breast cancer [67] and is not currently, to our
knowledge, considered for ADC development. ADAM12
is involved in a variety of biological processes involving
cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and is also known as
a potential drug target in breast cancer [68]. Interestingly,
two of the abovementioned potential targets, namely FAP
and ADAM12, are also known to be involved in the EMT
[69–71].
In this study, gene expression data mining was
preferred as a medium for target selection and prioritization
because of the near-transcriptome coverage of modern
microarray platforms and the public availability of thousands
of human gene expression datasets. Mass spectrometrybased proteomics data analysis would, in contrast, provide
better estimates of the quantity of interest (the actual protein
abundance), although in a lower number of publically
available samples, and at a typically lower resolution.

Correlation between mRNA and protein levels was found
to be relatively poor in a number of studies [72]. This lack
of correlation may be due in part to experimental noise
and biases unique to each technique. The quantification of
analytes (mRNA and peptides) using indirect signals (probe
and peak intensities) may also contribute to this discrepancy.
In a recent study, Schwanhaüsser et al. [73] quantified
cellular mRNA and protein expression levels and turnover
in mouse cells and found that the cellular abundance of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proteins was mostly controlled at the level of translation.
However, Wilhelm et al. [74] recently analyzed mRNA and
protein levels in human tissues and demonstrated that the
translation rate is a constant characteristic of a transcript, and
that the amount of protein in a cell is primarily controlled
by transcription. This result is important: it implicates that
differential expression at the mRNA level should correspond
to differential abundance at the protein level, although not
necessarily in a linear fashion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Apart from tumor specificity, other factors such
as tumor-specific aberrant subcellular localization
may influence target selection. The glycoprotein nmb
(GPNMB), for example, was characterized with high
expression in all breast cancer subtypes versus normal
tissues in average, but with relatively high expression
in some normal tissues (breast, heart, lung and skin).
GPNMB subcellular localization, however, tends to be
restricted to intracellular compartments in normal cells,
while being enriched on the cell surface in tumor cells
[75]. In other cases, normal tissues may be considered
expandables in some patients. In our list of candidate
targets, some genes including, for example, the gammaaminobutyric acid receptor subunit pi (GABRP) and
cadherin 3, type 1 (CDH3), were characterized by high
expression in breast cancer versus normal tissues, but
with relatively high levels in normal breast. Toxicity in
healthy breast tissue could be a concern and such targets
may be appropriate only for subsets of patients undergoing
complete mastectomy.
Exploratory gene expression analysis was
performed to select candidate ADC targets, for further
experimental validation at the protein level, in cell line
and animal models and ultimately in clinical trials. Any
of the genes in our list, EMT-related or not, respects the
fundamental criterion for ADC target selection (high
expression in tumor cells and lower expression in normal
tissues). Although membrane proteins represent more
attractive targets for use in ADC internalization strategies,
extracellular proteins may also prove useful, given that
strategies such as that reported in [35] are developed
and tested. Some of the selected ADC targets would be
interesting candidates in triple-negative tumors. These
deserve even higher attention for further experimental
testing and validation, because triple-negative breast
cancer patients have currently no targeted therapy
options, and have a generally poorer prognosis. The same
approach could be used to mine gene expression data in
other cancers, and to identify additional targets for ADC
development.

Microarray data collection
Raw microarray data corresponding to 101,334
samples analyzed using the Affymetrix Human Genome
U133 Plus 2.0 platform [16] was obtained from the GEO
database [15] using custom Perl scripts. Additional,
tumor-derived cell line gene expression profiling data
was downloaded from the CellMiner database [76]
and the caBIG database [77]. To have a complete set
with three replicates for each of the 359 unique cell
lines, additional samples from GEO (GSM274690,
GSM274785, GSM559851, GSM886956, GSM887076,
GSM887415, GSM887651) were added to those datasets.
Data analysis was performed using R version 3.1.1
[78] and Bioconductor version 3.0 [79]. CEL files were
read in R with the affy package [80] using BrainArray
Entrez Gene custom chip definition file version 18 [47],
and normalized using the MAS 5.0 algorithm [81]. Preprocessed microarray data was stored in indexed binary
files for efficient storage and retrieval.

Metadata analysis
Metadata associated with 101,334 samples (sample
id, series id, title, description, source, characteristics) and the
corresponding 3,643 series (series id, title, summary, overall
design, pubmed ids) were retrieved using GEOmetadb [18]
and stored in a SQLite database. Publications (pubmed id,
year, journal, title, abstract) linked with the experiments
were retrieved using Bioperl utilities [82] and stored in the
database. A new table was created for the purpose of sample
re-annotation. This table was populated using dedicated
Java software comprising a search engine translating
Boolean queries into SQL statements and a spreadsheetlike interface allowing direct and programmatic editing
of annotations. Breast cancer samples (4,853 tumor) and
normal tissue samples (1,067 blood, 291 bone marrow, 526
breast, 353 colon, 50 heart, 279 kidney, 287 liver, 478 lung,

over 200 experiments using this tool (Supplementary Data,
GEO Series).

classifiers. This procedure was repeated until the number
of predictions was stable over a number of iterations, or
until complete convergence was achieved.

Cell line classification

Breast sample classification

Results from Ross et al. [46] were used to label
NCI60 cell lines according to patterns of expression in
the epithelial, mesenchymal, melanoma and leukemia
gene clusters (Supplementary, Table S1). Cell lines
having high levels of expression of genes in the epithelial
cluster and low expression in the mesenchymal cluster
were labeled as epithelial, and cell lines characterized
by the opposite pattern were labeled as mesenchymal.
Cell lines having intermediate expression profiles
between these two classes were labeled as mixed. Cell
lines having levels of expression characteristic of the
melanoma and leukemia gene clusters were labeled as
melanoma and leukemia, respectively. Assigned class
labels were validated using repeated cross-validation
as described above, with the difference that feature
selection was performed separately in three sets of
replicates, and validation was performed in the two
remaining sets. For the OAO classification, class labels
were assigned where the maximum label allocation was
reached (four in ten binary classification problems),
and for the OAA classification, class labels were
assigned where only one label was assigned among
five classification problems. For the classification of
unlabeled cell lines, starting with the NCI60 panel, each
cell line replicate was randomly assigned to one of three
sets, and for each set, filter-based feature selection was
performed using three statistics as described above.
Classifiers were trained on each set of labeled replicates,
and predictions were made on each unlabeled cell line
replicate. Iterative ensemble classification method was
used as described above to assign labels to the new
cell lines using 324 votes from an ensemble of experts
(combination of three sets of labeled replicates, three
feature selection methods, two classification methods,
six increasing number of features, and three unlabeled
replicates).

Gene expression data was collected for a total of
5,379 breast samples. Receptor status data (ER, PR and
HER2) was available in sample annotations for 3,500
samples (1,766 complete, 1,734 partial). For each receptor,
two locally adaptive kernel densities were estimated
in annotated samples (positive, negative), and receptor
status in other samples was predicted by assigning the
label corresponding to the maximum posterior [83].
Samples were then assigned to one of four classes: normal
(annotated as normal), luminal (ER+ and/or PR+), HER2+
(ER-, PR-, and HER2+) and triple-negative (ER-, PR-,
HER2-). Classes were compared one-against-one (OAO)
and one-against-all (OAA) for multiclass classification
[84]. Filter-based feature selection was performed by
10
selecting the top ( 2k )
features ranked using three
k =1
different statistics: q-values derived from linear models
for microarray (Limma) moderated t-test [24, 85], the
overlapping coefficient of locally adaptive kernel density
estimates [30, 31], and the weight of support vector
machines (SVM) [29]. Locally adaptive kernel densities
and overlapping coefficients were computed using an inhouse R package implemented with Rcpp [86]. The weight
of SVM were computed using the e1071 R package [87].
To estimate classification error for combinations of feature
selection and classification algorithms, repeated (ten
times) five-fold stratified cross-validation was performed
[88, 89]. Classification was achieved using six algorithms
implemented in the RWeka package [90]: bagging [91],
J48 (C4.5 decision tree) [92], k-nearest neighbors (KNN)
[93], naive Bayes [94], random forests (RFO) [95] and
support vectors machines (SVM) [96]. For the OAO
classification, class labels were assigned where the
maximum label allocation was reached (three in six binary
classification problems). For OAA classification, class
labels were assigned where only one label was assigned
among four classification problems. For each combination
of factors in the cross-validation, the accuracy was
calculated as the sum of correct predictions divided
by the total number of predictions. The performance of
combinations of feature selection methods, classification
algorithms, number of features and classification strategies
was compared using analysis of variance, and the best
performing combinations were retained for ensemble
classification [97]. An iterative method [98] was used to
assign labels to breast samples. Labels assigned with high
confidence (>95% of votes) by an ensemble of experts
(36 votes from the combination of three feature selection
methods, two classification methods, and six increasing
number of features) were fed back into the data and
used for subsequent feature selection and training of the

Target selection and prioritization
To identify genes specific to or overexpressed in
breast cancer, expression profiles in each molecular subtype
were compared with gene expression in major organs and
tissues were toxicity would likely be a serious concern
(blood, bone marrow, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung,
pancreas, skin and stomach). An initial filtering was done
to retrieve genes with a maximum ratio (normal/cancer) of
2, an average ratio (cancer/normal) greater than 2 and an
average overlapping coefficient [30, 31] smaller than 0.6.
Subcellular localization data was obtained from Uniprot
annotations [50] and the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA)
database [49]. For each molecular subtype, protein-coding
2567

Oncotarget

genes were ranked according to the mean rank of ratios in
cancer versus normal tissues, and the top 50 (balanced with
respect to the three subtypes) cell membrane or extracellular
protein-coding genes were retained. Batch effects were
evaluated by extracting the first two principal components
(52% of total variance) from the 1,000 genes with highest
total variance in breast cancer and normal tissues, and
visualizing patterns associated with tissue source, sample
status and experiments. In addition, batch effects were
quantified using linear mixed models [99] with tissue and
status as fixed effects and series as random effect, and were
compared with the amplitude of differential expression
in the breast cancer subtype(s) in which the target was
identified versus normal tissues. To prioritize targets
linked with EMT, differential gene expression analysis was
performed between epithelial and mesenchymal tumorderived cell lines. The same parameters (expression ratio
> 2 and overlapping coefficient < 0.6) were used for the
selection of EMT-related targets.
