Abstract
Glioblastoma remains a devastating disease for which novel therapies are urgently needed. Here, we report that the
Aurora-A kinase inhibitor alisertib exhibits potent efﬁcacy against glioblastoma neurosphere tumor stem–like cells
in vitro and in vivo. Many glioblastoma neurosphere cells treated with alisertib for short periods undergo apoptosis,
although some regain proliferative activity upon drug removal. Extended treatment, however, results in complete
and irreversible loss of tumor cell proliferation. Moreover, alisertib caused glioblastoma neurosphere cells to partially
differentiate and enter senescence. These effects were also observed in glioma cells treated with the Aurora-A
inhibitor TC-A2317 or anti–Aurora-A siRNA. Furthermore, alisertib extended median survival of mice bearing
intracranial human glioblastoma neurosphere tumor xenografts. Alisertib exerted similar effects on glioblastoma
neurosphere cells in vivo and resulted in markedly reduced activated phosphoThr288Aurora-A and increased
abnormal mitoses and cellular ploidy, consistent with on-target activity. Our results offer preclinical proof-ofconcept for alisertib as a new therapeutic for glioma treatment. Cancer Res; 74(19); 5364–70. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Aurora-A is a serine/threonine kinase critical for centrosome duplication, spindle assembly, and mitotic exit (1–3).
Aurora-A also drives cell-cycle progression by promoting cyclin
B1, Wnt, myc, and other pro-proliferative pathways (4–6).
Aurora-A knockdown blocks cellular proliferation and may
induce tetraploidy, apoptosis, and senescence in vitro (7–9).
Aurora-A kinase inhibitors have, thus, emerged as unique
antiproliferative agents inhibiting mitosis and important
signaling pathways.
Alisertib (MLN8237) is a highly selective Aurora-A kinase
inhibitor in clinical trials for a variety of malignancies (10).
Because novel approaches are urgently needed for the treatment of glioblastoma, we tested alisertib against glioblastoma
neurosphere tumor stem–like cells in vitro and in vivo.

Center (Columbus, OH) under an Institutional Review Board–
approved protocol. Minced tissue was passed through 18- and
21-gauge needles to achieve single cell suspensions. Cells were
cultured in DMEM/F12 containing N2 supplement (Invitrogen) and 20 ng/mL each of epidermal growth factor and basic
ﬁbroblast growth factor (R&D Systems). Neurospheres were
passaged by trituration with a 21-gauge needle. U87 cells
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were
grown in DMEM/10% FCS. No additional authentication was
performed on these cells.
The investigational Aurora-A inhibitor alisertib was provided by Takeda Pharmaceuticals. TC-A2317 (11) was from
Tocris Bioscience. For growth curves, cells were plated at 104
cells per well in 24-well plates in the presence of drug or
DMSO vehicle (0.0032%–0.02%). Every 2 days, three wells per
condition were triturated and cells counted (Coulter model
Z2). Metabolic activity was measured by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide conversion to
formazan (MTT assay). Cells were plated in 96-well plates at
104 cells per well in 100 mL of medium containing alisertib or
DMSO. After 4 days at 37 C, 10 mL of MTT reagent (Roche)
was added per well and plates processed per the manufacturer's instructions.

b-galactosidase assay
Neurospheres were treated for 12 days with 200 nmol/L
alisertib or DMSO alone. Cytospins were prepared by centrifuging glioblastoma neurospheres onto charged glass slides
(3 minutes at 800 rpm). Slides were ﬁxed in 2% formaldehyde,
0.2% glutaraldehyde, and stained for b-galactosidase activity
using the Senescence b-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signaling Technology).
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA containing 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride, 10 mg/mL aprotinin, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, 20

Mouse orthotopic xenograft model
All animal experiments were Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee approved (2013A0051). Female athymic mice
(nu/nu genotype, 6–8 weeks, 20–25 g weight, NCI strain 01B74)
were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine (100 mg/kg)/
xylazine (20 mg/kg) and ﬁtted into stereotactic frames (David
Kopf Instruments). A small incision was made just lateral to
the midline and a 1.0-mm burr hole was drilled at AP ¼ þ1 mm,
ML ¼ 2.5 mm from the bregma. Two microliters of a single
neurosphere cell suspension (50,000 cells/mL) was deposited at
1 mL/min into the right caudate nucleus at a depth of 3 mm
from the dura. The burr hole was ﬁlled with bone wax and the
incision closed (4-0 vicryl suture).
Beginning 5 days after implantation, mice were orally gavaged
with 20 mg/kg alisertib dissolved in 10% (2-hydroxypropyl)b-cylcodextrin, 1% sodium bicarbonate or vehicle alone twice
daily 5 days per week. Mice were monitored daily and sacriﬁced
according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committeeapproved methods and criteria for neurologic symptoms.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
FFPE sections (4 mm) of mouse brain tissue were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). For immunohistochemis-

try, sections were deparafﬁnized, rehydrated, blocked with 3%
H2O2 for 5 minutes at 25 C and treated with Target Retrieval
Solution (Dako) for 25 minutes at 96 C. For anti-phosphoThr288Aurora-A, slides were further blocked with Protein Block
Serum-Free (Dako) for 15 minutes at 25 C. Slides were incubated with anti–phosphoThr288Aurora-A (Abcam ab58494;
1:200) or anti–phosphohistone-H3 (Abcam ab5176; 1:1,400) for
1 hour at 25 C. Antibodies were detected using MACH 3 Rabbit
HRP-Polymer (BioCare) and DAB (Dako). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Control- and alisertib-treated neurosphere cytospins were
stained with H&E or immunostained with anti–b-catenin (BD
Pharmingen # 610153; 1:2,500). For Feulgen staining, GB9 cells
were treated for 5 days with 200 nmol/L alisertib or DMSO and
cytospins prepared. Slides were stained using the Blue Feulgen
DNA Ploidy Analysis Staining Kit (ScyTek) and scanned with
an Aperio XT ScanScope. Image analysis was performed
with Deﬁniens Tissue Studio 3.6 (51,480 control neurosphere
nuclei and 15,864 alisertib-treated neurosphere nuclei were
examined).

Results and Discussion
Effect of Aurora-A inhibition on growth and survival of
glioma neurosphere cells
Glioblastoma neurosphere cells demonstrate tumor stem
cell–like properties and are considered to closely mimic the
biologic behavior of naturally occurring gliomas (12, 13). We
performed growth curve analysis of glioblastoma neurosphere
cells with and without small-molecule Aurora-A inhibitors.
Alisertib potently blocked proliferation of all three neurosphere lines tested (Fig. 1A). IC50 concentrations were 11,
24, and 32 nmol/L for GB169, GB9, and GB30 cells, respectively.
Another Aurora-A inhibitor, TC-A2317 (11) was less potent,
demonstrating IC50 concentrations of 170, 179 and 168 nmol/L
for these cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Observed
alisertib IC50 concentrations are similar to slightly higher than
those required to inhibit colony formation in two other glioblastoma neurosphere lines (14) and approximately 5- to 10fold less than those effective against 10 conventional monolayer glioblastoma cell lines (15), suggesting greater efﬁcacy
against glioblastoma neurosphere cells.
We also examined the impact of alisertib on glioblastoma
neurospheres using MTT assays. Although alisertib reduced the
metabolic activity of these cells, the magnitude of response was
less than that seen by cell counts (Fig. 1B). Short exposure to
highly antiproliferative concentrations of alisertib, for example,
200 nmol/L, reduced total cellular metabolism by approximately 28% to 33% (Fig. 1B), similar to the fraction of cells in which an
equivalent alisertib exposure induces apoptosis (Fig. 1B and C).
This suggests that despite attenuated proliferation, some tumor
cells remained metabolically active following treatment. Therefore, the antiproliferative effect of Aurora-A kinase inhibition
cannot be due solely to immediate tumor stem–like cell killing.
To test whether alisertib-induced toxicity was due to
increased apoptosis, we measured Annexin-V staining in alisertib-treated normal human astrocytes and glioblastoma
cells. Alisertib did not induce signiﬁcant Annexin-V staining
in human astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In contrast,

Figure 1. Effect of alisertib on proliferation and viability of glioblastoma neurosphere cells. A, glioblastoma neurospheres were cultured 7 days with various
concentrations of alisertib or DMSO and counted. Means  SD of triplicate wells are depicted. B, neurospheres were treated for 5 days with alisertib or DMSO
and MTT assays were performed. Data, means  SD of triplicate wells. Three experiments provided similar results. All alisertib treatments were signiﬁcantly
different from controls, P > 0.05. C, glioblastoma neurospheres were treated with 200 nmol/L alisertib for 3 to 12 days followed by Annexin V immunostaining.
5
D, glioblastoma neurosphere cells were plated in 60-mm dishes (5  10 /dish) and treated with 200 nmol/L alisertib or DMSO (neurospheres in DMSO
treatments were dispersed every 3 days to prevent overgrowth). Every 3 days, one-half of the cells per time point dish were pelleted, washed with PBS, and
recultured in 24-well plates with 200 nmol/L alisertib (continuous) or DMSO (recovered) for an additional 3 days and counted.

alisertib-treated glioblastoma neurosphere cells showed
increased Annexin-V staining indicative of apoptosis, reaching
approximately 85% after 12 days of drug exposure (Fig. 1C and
Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Because alisertib caused only a limited amount of apoptosis
after 6 days of exposure and did not completely prevent
metabolic activity in glioblastoma neurospheres, we investigated whether neurosphere cells could resume proliferation
following treatment. Glioblastoma neurospheres were exposed
to alisertib continuously for 3 to 12 days, the drug washed out,
and cells cultured with or without alisertib for an additional 3
days. Cell counts were then obtained to measure glioblastoma
cell proliferative potential following drug treatment (Fig. 1D
and Supplementary Fig. S1C). In a similar experiment, recovery
of metabolic activity following extended alisertib exposure was
examined by MTT assay (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
If alisertib-treated cells retained proliferative capacity, total
cell counts should increase when further cultured in drug-free

media. As shown in Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1C, after 3
days of alisertib treatment, glioblastoma neurosphere cells
allowed to recover in drug-free media showed increased numbers compared with continually treated cells. The difference in
tumor cell numbers between cultures continually treated for 6
days and those treated for 6 days and allowed to recover in
drug-free media was negligible, however, indicating nearly
complete loss of tumor cell proliferative potential. A similar
reduction of recoverable MTT activity took longer, suggesting
total senescence and/or death of a small population of persisting cells (15%–20%) required extended drug exposure, but
eventually occurred (Supplementary Fig. S1D).

contained fewer, but larger cells (Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Fig. S2). More cells were attached to the culture dish and many
exhibited prominent astrocyte-like processes. Furthermore,
alisertib caused a strong increase in b-galactosidase staining
(Fig. 2B).
H&E-stained cytospins conﬁrmed that individual alisertibtreated glioblastoma neurosphere cells were greatly enlarged
(Fig. 2C). Quantitation of nuclear DNA by image analysis of
Feulgen-stained (16) cytospins revealed that tumor nuclei
mean area increased from 98.7 mm2 in control cells to 416
mm2 in alisertib-treated cells, indicating failed cytokinesis and
tetraploidy (Fig. 2D).
Aurora-A kinase activity depends on activation by autophosphorylation at threonine 288 (17). Western blots for
phosphoThr288Aurora-A show that phosphoThr288Aurora-A is
markedly decreased in alisertib- and TC-A2317–treated glioblastoma neurospheres verifying drug target-hit (Fig. 3A and B;
Supplementary Fig. S3A).
To look for biochemical evidence of apoptosis, differentiation, and senescence of glioblastoma neurosphere cells in
response to Aurora-A inhibitors, we immunoblotted for proteins indicative of these processes. Consistent with Annexin-V
staining (Fig. 1C), BimEL, a proapoptotic BH3-only protein
negatively regulated by Aurora-A (18) and/or cleaved PARP
were consistently elevated in alisertib- or TC-A2317–treated
cells (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Fig. S3A).

Olig2, a transcription factor expressed in normal and neoplastic astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, was increased in all
glioblastoma neurosphere lines treated with alisertib or TCA2317 (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Fig. S3A). GFAP and
Aldh1L1, markers of astrocytic differentiation (19), were also
increased in response to alisertib (Fig. 3A and B). Unlike
neurosphere tumor stem–like cells, U87 glioma cells expressed
high basal levels of GFAP; however, alisertib treatment prevented the decreased GFAP expression seen in U87 cells
approaching conﬂuence (Fig. 3A). In agreement with observed
elevated b-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2B), expression of the
cellular senescence associated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
inhibitor p21 (20) was strongly increased by alisertib (Fig. 3A
and B) and TC-A2317 (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Western blot analysis for markers of stemness revealed that
Musashi-1, an RNA-binding protein involved in stem cell selfrenewal (21), the cancer stem cell marker CD44 (22), and
b-catenin were all markedly decreased in alisertib-treated
glioblastoma neurosphere cells (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary
Fig. S3B). b-Catenin was also decreased by TC-A2317 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). As b-catenin is required for CNS progenitor
self-renewal (23), these results may correlate with a decreased
capacity for glioblastoma neurosphere cell self-renewal following Aurora-A inhibition.
The neural stem cell marker nestin was also decreased by
alisertib in GB9 and GB30 cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, nestin was

increased after alisertib treatment in GB169 cells. Not all
glioblastoma stem-like cells express speciﬁc stem and differentiation markers equally (12). Moreover, nestin expression is
not exclusive to neural stem cells but is also found in regenerating neurons and glia (24), as well as many CNS neoplasms.
Unlike in GB9 and GB30 cells, alisertib also increased neuroﬁlament protein expression in GB169 cells (Fig. 3B) possibly
correlating with increased nestin and induction of an early
neuronal differentiation program in these cells. Thus, apoptosis, differentiation, senescence, and/or loss of neurosphere
tumor cell stemness are likely factors contributing to the
antiproliferative effect of Aurora-A inhibition in glioblastoma
cells in vitro.
To investigate whether the above observed biochemical
effects of alisertib on glioblastoma cells were Aurora-A speciﬁc,
we transfected U87 glioma cells with anti–Aurora-A siRNAs.
Aurora-A knockdown resulted in biochemical changes similar
to those caused by alisertib, including reduced CD44 and
increased expression of cleaved PARP, GFAP, and the senescence-associated CDK inhibitor p27 (Fig. 3C). Thus, the

response of glioblastoma neurosphere cells to Aurora-A kinase
inhibition or mRNA knockdown includes apoptosis, differentiation, and senescence. In addition, Aurora-A itself is involved
in maintaining embryonic stem cells in the undifferentiated
state (25). Thus, another mechanism in which Aurora-A inhibition may be effective against glioma cells could be by
inducing a loss of stemness. This may be an important mechanism, possibly leading to sensitization of gliomas to other
therapies or inhibiting the emergence of therapy-resistant
tumor cell clones.

To determine whether alisertib was effective against

and GB169 intracranial xenografts with the drug. As shown
in Fig. 4A, alisertib signiﬁcantly extended the survival of
mice with intracranial xenografts of both glioblastoma neurosphere lines. Mice with GB169 xenografts showed a 25.2%
increase in median survival (87 days for alisertib-treated

whereas survival was increased by 33.3% in mice with GB30
xenografts (26 days for alisertib-treated compared with 19.5
days for vehicle-treated, P < 0.0001).
Examination of GB169 xenograft tumors from alisertibtreated mice revealed similar effects to those observed in
vitro. As shown in Fig. 4B, glioblastomas from alisertibtreated mice demonstrated enlarged nuclei and greatly
decreased phosphoThr288Aurora-A compared with control
mice (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, phosphohistone-H3 immunostaining revealed large numbers of abnormal arrested mitoses
as previously described for Aurora-A inhibition (26), whereas
mitoses in tumors from control mice more often resembled
normal metaphase or telophase (Fig. 4D). These observations conﬁrm that alisertib exhibited target-speciﬁc effects
on glioblastoma cells in vivo.
In summary, the Aurora-A inhibitor alisertib potently inhibits proliferation of glioblastoma tumor neurosphere stem-like
cells in vitro and demonstrates Aurora-A–speciﬁc target-hit
effects in vitro and in vivo. It also signiﬁcantly extends the
survival of mice with intracranial glioblastoma neurosphere
xenografts. Alisertib is, therefore, a promising new potential
