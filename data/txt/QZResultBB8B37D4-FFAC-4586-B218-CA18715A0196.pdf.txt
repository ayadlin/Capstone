exhibiting Lkb1 mutations include head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) and pancreatic cancer (9), which are also associated with tobacco smoking.
Lkb1 regulates cellular energy metabolism and cell polarity
through its capacity to phosphorylate and activate AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK), as well as other members of the AMPK
subfamily (10–14). Activated AMPK restores ATP levels by promoting ATP-producing catabolic processes (e.g., glycolysis) and
blocking ATP-consuming biosynthetic processes (including mTORdirected protein synthesis; ref. 15). Lkb1-mediated regulation of
AMPK has tissue-specific effects on glucose metabolism. In skeletal
muscle, Lkb1 deletion results in loss of AMPK function and
improved glucose uptake (16). Lkb1 knockout in the liver causes
inactivation of both AMPK and of the AMPK family member SIK2
and produces metabolic defects, including deregulated gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis (17). LKB1 is also an essential modulator
of cellular structure and polarity through activation of AMPK, as well
as the microtubule affinity–regulating kinases (MARK1–MARK4)
and SAD/Brsk kinases (SAD-A and SAD-B; refs. 18–24). Collectively, these data indicate that energy sensing and cell polarity may
be broadly integrated under the control of LKB1-AMPK family
signaling.
The specific signaling pathways, by which Lkb1 suppresses both
malignant and benign tumorigenesis, and the relative contributions
of the AMPK-related family members to these processes are
unknown. In this regard, it is provocative that PTEN, TSC, and
LKB1, tumor suppressor genes associated with hamartoma and
cancer syndromes, are all negative regulators of mTOR activity (25).
Hence, the AMPK-mTOR pathway is a plausible mediator of Lkb1
in restraining tumor development. In support of this notion, both
Lkb1 mutant hamartomas and lung cancer cell lines show
deregulation of mTOR signaling (11, 26), although the biological
significance of mTOR activation has yet to be defined in these
tumors. At the cellular level, Lkb1 has been implicated in the direct
control of cell growth in vitro through several mechanisms. Lkb1
overexpression in melanoma and lung cancer cell lines blocks
colony formation associated with the induction of the p53-p21 and
PTEN pathways, respectively (27, 28). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEF) lacking Lkb1 escape culture-induced senescence, suggesting
a potential role in cellular response to oxidative stress (29). Despite
their immortal growth, Lkb1/ MEFs are resistant to transformation by activated H-ras, a property that distinguishes Lkb1deficient MEFs from those with classic immortalizing lesions in the
Rb and p53 pathways.
Genetic models in which Lkb1 inactivation promotes carcinoma
formation enable the study of Lkb1 tumor suppressor pathways
in vivo. Given the association of Lkb1 mutation with carcinogenassociated malignancies and the need for Lkb1 mutant cancer
models, we assessed the effect of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene
(DMBA) exposure on Lkb1-deficient mice.

Abstract
Lkb1 is a central regulator of cell polarity and energy metabolism through its capacity to activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)–related family of protein kinases. Germ
line–inactivating mutation of Lkb1 leads to Peutz-Jeghers
syndrome, which is characterized by benign hamartomas and
a susceptibility to malignant epithelial tumors. Mutations in
Lkb1 are also found in sporadic carcinomas, most frequently
in lung cancers associated with tobacco carcinogen exposure.
The basis for Lkb1-dependent tumor suppression is not
defined. Here, we uncover a marked sensitivity of Lkb1 mutant
mice to the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA). Lkb1+/ mice are highly prone to DMBAinduced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin and lung.
Confirming a cell autonomous tumor suppressor role of Lkb1,
mice with epidermal-specific Lkb1 deletion are also susceptible to DMBA-induced SCC and develop spontaneous SCC with
long latency. Restoration of wild-type Lkb1 causes senescence
in tumor-derived cell lines, a process that can be partially bypassed by inactivation of the Rb pathway, but not by inactivation of p53 or AMPK. Our data indicate that Lkb1 is a potent
suppressor of carcinogen-induced skin and lung cancers and
that downstream targets beyond the AMPK-mTOR pathway
are likely mediators of Lkb1-dependent tumor suppression.

Introduction
The Lkb1 tumor suppressor encodes a serine-threonine kinase
that is mutated in individuals with the Peutz-Jeghers polyposis and
cancer syndrome (1, 2). Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients develop
benign polyps (hamartomas) during adolescence and have a high
incidence of gastrointestinal and lung carcinomas as adults (3, 4).
Carcinomas in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients arise independently of the hamartomas; hence, the mechanisms by which Lkb1
controls benign polyposis and malignancy may be distinct (5). Lkb1
is also mutated in sporadic cancers whose spectrum of tumor types
suggests cooperation with exposure to environmental carcinogens.
Lkb1 alterations are most prevalent in lung cancers with mutations
detected in f30% of specimens (6–8). Significantly, Lkb1 mutations in lung cancer are highly correlated with a history of tobacco
smoking and show a preferential occurrence of GC:TA substitutions, suggesting a mutational effect of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts from tobacco carcinogens (8). Other carcinomas

Lkb1+/ mice (29) with a single topical dose of DMBA. DMBA acts
systemically under this protocol, promoting the gradual development of lymphomas, sarcomas, and lung adenomas in wild-type
mice (32). The mouse cohorts were monitored for tumor incidence
and spectrum up to 40 weeks of age. Lkb1+/ mice showed a
significantly reduced cancer-free survival (28.6 weeks versus >40
weeks) and altered tumor spectrum relative to Lkb1+/+ animals
(Fig. 1A and D; Lkb1+/ mice developing benign hamartomas were
censored in the survival analysis). The increased mortality in the
Lkb1+/ cohort was due to the development of invasive skin and
lung cancers (present in 18 of 42 Lkb1+/ mice), tumors types that
were not observed in wild-type animals (Fig. 1B, C,i, and D).
Histologic analysis and staining for both cytokeratin-14 and p63
revealed that these lung and skin tumors were all malignant SCC
(Fig. 1C,ii–vi). Lymphomas were observed in both wild-type and
mutant cohorts with similar incidence and latency. DMBA
exposure did not affect the incidence or histopathology of
hamartomas in Lkb1+/ animals (not shown). Hence, Lkb1
heterozygosity specifically sensitizes mice to DMBA-induced SCC.
Lkb1 mutant SCC do not evolve from the classic DMBAinduced papilloma-to-SCC sequence. The molecular progression
of DMBA-induced SCC in wild-type mice is well described (33).
Specifically, A-T transversions at H-ras codon 61 (CAA!CTA) are a
hallmark of DMBA-induced skin carcinogenesis, serving to initiate
the development of benign papillomas that undergo gradual
multistage progression to malignant SCC (33, 34). Mutations of
various tumor suppressor genes can increase papilloma number or
accelerate papilloma-to-SCC progression. Notably, papillomas were
not observed before SCC development in serially monitored
DMBA-treated Lkb1+/ mice. Furthermore, we did not detect
papillomatous changes adjacent to carcinoma in our histologic
analysis. Finally, the incidence of papillomas was comparable in
the wild-type and mutant cohorts (4 of 42 Lkb1+/+ mice and 3 of
42 Lkb1+/ mice developed papillomas).
We used allele-specific PCR and direct sequencing to test the
mutational status of H-ras in the papillomas and SCC arising in our
study. All papillomas had activating H-ras mutations, regardless of
Lkb1 genotype ( four of four papillomas from Lkb1+/+ mice and
three of three from Lkb1+/ mice; Fig. 2C and data not shown).
On the other hand, none of the SCC arising in the Lkb1+/ mice
(0 of 17 SCC tested) exhibited H-ras mutations (Fig. 2A and data
not shown), a finding consistent with the lack of an observed
papilloma-SCC sequence in these mice. Together, these results
suggest that SCC associated with Lkb1 loss may involve pathways
distinct from those in H-ras–induced SCC. Alternatively, Lkb1 loss
could lead to activation of H-ras or its effectors obviating the need
for concurrent H-ras mutations (see below).
The wild-type Lkb1 allele is inactivated in SCC from Lkb1+/
mice. The benign hamartomas arising in Lkb1+/ mice and PeutzJeghers syndrome patients seem to be driven primarily by Lkb1
haploinsufficiency since loss of wild-type Lkb1 expression is not an
obligate event in these tumors (29, 35–37). We sought to assess the
status of the wild-type Lkb1 allele in the malignant SCC arising in
Lkb1+/ mice. Southern blot analysis of tumor DNA revealed loss of
wild-type Lkb1 in 8 of 20 specimens (Fig. 2B and data not shown).
Furthermore, Western and Northern blot analyses showed that all
SCC and SCC-derived cell lines lacked Lkb1 expression regardless
of the status of the wild-type allele (Fig. 2C and D), suggesting that
the Lkb1 wild-type allele is inactivated by multiple mechanisms in
SCC, including deletion and possibly point mutation or promoter
hypermethylation. In comparison, robust Lkb1 expression was

Mouse strains and DMBA treatment. Lkb1
and Lkb1 strains have
been previously described (29). To generate K14-Cre Lkb1L/L and littermate
control, K14-Cre/Lkb1L/+ males were crossed with Lkb1L/L females. The
Lkb1+/ mice and littermates were on an inbred FVB/n genetic background.
The K14-Cre Lkb1L/L mice and control animals were f87.5% FVB/n. For
carcinogenesis studies, 5-day-old to 7-day-old mice were treated with a
single dose of 50 AL of DMBA (Sigma) in acetone (0.5% w/v) applied directly
onto mouse’s back.

previously (29). Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488
(Molecular Probes), anti-rabbit and anti-mouse biotin and anti–horseradish peroxidase antibodies (Vector Labs), MOM kit, and ABC Vector kit
(Vector Labs).
Immunostaining. Dorsal skin samples were fixed for overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde, then embedded in paraffin or frozen in optimum cutting
temperature (OCT). Before freezing in OCT, tissue was shaken in PBS, 10%,
20%, and 30% sucrose for 1 h each. Ten-micron sections were used for all
experiments. After immunohistochemical staining, images were taken using
Leica DM100 microscope and Leica DC500 camera. After immunofluorescent staining, images were taken with a Leica confocal microscope under a
40 oil immersion objective using the same laser intensity and Z-settings
and analyzed with LCS Advanced software. For each marker, at least three
independent samples were evaluated for each genotype.
H-ras mutational analysis. H-ras codon 61 status was ascertained by
allele-specific PCR analysis. Oligonucleotides H-rasF-wt 5¶-GACATCTTAGACACAGCAGGTCA and H-rasR 5¶-TGGTGTTGTTGATGGCAAATACT
were used to detect the wild-type allele. H-rasF-mut 5¶-GACATCTTAGACACAGCAGGTCT and H-rasR were used to detect the CAA!CTA
mutation. Sequence analysis of H-ras codons 12, 13, and 61 was performed
after amplification of genomic DNA sequences flanking these regions.
SCC cell lines. Cell lines were derived from SCC tumor tissue as
described in ref. 30. Briefly, tumor tissue was rinsed in PBS, minced finely
with sterile razor blades, incubated in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37jC for 20
min with intermittent tituration, and plated in fibronectin/vitrogen-coated
plates in keratinocyte media (Ca+-free EMEM, 8% chelexed serum, 50 ng/mL
cholera toxin, 1 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, 2 mmol/L glutamine, 0.1–0.3 mmol/L
Ca). The AB-B9 cell line, a murine DMBA–12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol13-acetate (TPA)–induced SCC cell line with wild-type Lkb1, was used as a
control (31).
Molecular and cellular analysis. RNA and DNA isolation was
performed as described using standard procedures. SCC or papilloma
tissue was homogenized in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES, 250 mmol/L
NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors
(Roche), and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem)] on ice. SCC cell lines
were infected with retroviruses expressing vector, GFP, Lkb1, or Lkb1-KD,
selected with puromycin, harvested in lysis buffer at indicated time points,
subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with indicated antibody.
For cell proliferation assays, the cells were plated in 96-well plate
24 h postinfection and assayed using the WST-1 cell proliferation assay
reagent (Roche).

detected in papillomas from both Lkb1+/ and Lkb1+/+ mice, in
SCC cell lines generated from DMBA-TPA–treated wild-type mice
(31), and in epidermal keratinocytes, the normal cellular counterparts to SCC (Figs. 2C and 3B). Hence, inactivation of the wild-type
Lkb1 allele is specifically associated with SCC pathogenesis in
Lkb1+/ mice.
Selective inactivation of Lkb1 in the epidermis sensitizes
mice to carcinogen-induced and spontaneous SCC. Cutaneous
SCC arises from the transformation of epidermal progenitors (38).
We sought to examine Lkb1 function in the epidermis and to determine whether homozygous inactivation in this compartment is
sufficient to promote SCC development. To this end, we generated
mice with selective epidermal deletion of Lkb1 by crossing the
Lkb1L/L and keratin-14–Cre strains (29, 39). Keratin-14–Cre Lkb1L/L
mice (hereafter, designated K14:Lkb1) were born at the expected
frequency, but were smaller than Lkb1lox/lox and K14-Cre Lkb1+/+
controls. The K14:Lkb1 animals exhibited delays in hair growth

and had wavy and less dense hair as adults (Fig. 3A). Northern blot
analysis of primary keratinocytes confirmed Lkb1 was specifically
inactivated in the epidermis of these mice (Fig. 3A, bottom).
Cutaneous histology revealed a diminution in hair shaft diameter,
increased erythema of the skin (reddening associated with
congestion of the capillaries), and mild follicular plugging ( filling
of follicular openings with keratinous debris; Fig. 3B,i). In addition, these animals had corneal opacity associated with hyperkeratinization of the corneal epithelium (data not shown).
Immunofluorescence analysis of K14, K1, and involucrin revealed
comparable staining in the epidermis of K14:Lkb1 and control
mice, indicating that epidermal differentiation is not compromised in the absence of Lkb1 (Fig. 3B,ii–iv). BrdUrd analysis of
the epidermal compartment showed similar rates of proliferation between 3-week-old control and K14:Lkb1 animals (the
frequency of BrdUrd + nuclei/field was 8 F 1.7 and 7.5 F 1.7,
respectively), indicating that Lkb1 does not influence keratinocyte

analysis failed to reveal significant alterations in epidermal cell
death or defects in epidermal polarity in the K14:Lkb1 animals.
Despite their grossly normal epidermal development and homeostasis, a subset of K14:Lkb1 mice developed spontaneous SCC by

the age of 40 weeks (3 of 20 mice). The relatively long latency and
absence of an early hyperproliferative phenotype in these mice
suggest that Lkb1 functions as a tumor suppressor in the epidermis
but that the development of SCC requires additional oncogenic
changes.

Carcinogen-Induced Tumors in Lkb1 Mutant Mice

In contrast to the long latency in spontaneous tumor development, the K14:Lkb1 mice were highly tumor-prone after DMBA
administration. Invasive skin cancers were observed in six of
six DMBA-treated K14:Lkb1 mice (average latency, 8 weeks)
whereas 0 of 10 DMBA-treated control animals developed tumors
by 15 weeks (Fig. 3C). Histologic analysis confirmed that these
tumors were SCC resembling those observed in the DMBA-treated
Lkb1+/ mice (Fig. 3D). Hence, homozygous deletion of Lkb1 in
the epidermis renders mice highly sensitive to SCC initiated by a
chemical carcinogen.
Signaling pathways in Lkb1 mutant SCC. Having shown a
critical role for Lkb1 in suppression of DMBA-induced SCC, we
wished to define molecular alterations associated with tumorigenesis in Lkb1 mutant mice. RAF pull-down assays showed elevated
levels of activated Ras-GTP in Lkb1 mutant SCC relative to papillomas and normal skin despite the absence of H-ras mutations in
these tumors (Fig. 4A). Previous genetic studies have shown that
RAF-MEK-ERK–cyclin D1 and EGFR–phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)–AKT pathways are critical effectors of Ras-directed skin
carcinogenesis and that the activity of these pathways increases
gradually during papilloma SCC progression (40–43). Western blot
analysis showed that five of six Lkb1 mutant SCC tested expressed
p-ERK, whereas p-ERK was absent in all six papillomas tested
(Fig. 4B and data not shown). Cyclin D1 and p-c-Jun levels were
elevated in all SCC relative to papillomas. Finally, p-EGFR was
detectable in all SCC, and robust p-AKT levels were noted in four of
six of these tumors (Fig. 4B and data not shown). Together, these
results indicate that although no activating H-Ras mutations are
present in the Lkb1 mutant SCC, Ras signaling pathways are
deregulated in these tumors.
The AMPK-TSC-mTOR pathway is a candidate mediator of Lkb1dependent tumor suppression. Western blot analysis showed that
Lkb1 mutant SCC (n = 6 SCC) had diminished ACC Ser79
phosphorylation relative to papillomas (n = 6 papillomas),
consistent with loss of AMPK activity in these tumors (Fig. 4C
and data not shown). Correspondingly, p-S6K Thr421/Ser424 levels
were increased in the Lkb1 mutant SCCs, whereas there was
heterogeneous expression of p-S6 Ser435/436. Hence, AMPK activity
is compromised in Lkb1 mutant SCC, although the level of mTOR
signaling was not markedly increased in these tumors relative to
papillomas.
Restoration of Lkb1 in SCC cell lines results in growth arrest
that cannot be rescued by disruption of AMPK signaling. The
Lkb1 mutant SCC cell lines that we established from DMBA-treated
mice provided a system to address the mechanisms of Lkb1dependent tumor suppression. SCC cell lines generated from
DMBA/TPA-treated wild-type mice served as controls for these
studies (31). Human cancer genetics studies suggest that Lkb1
kinase activity is critical for tumor suppression because most
cancer-associated Lkb1 mutations result in impaired catalytic
activity (9). Correspondingly, introduction of retroviruses expressing wild-type Lkb1, but not a kinase-dead mutant, resulted in rapid
induction of growth arrest in these cell lines (Fig. 5A, top). This
phenotype was specific because Lkb1 overexpression did not affect
the growth characteristics of SCC cell lines harboring wild-type
Lkb1 (Fig. 5A, bottom).
Next, we assessed the role of the AMPK pathway in Lkb1directed growth arrest. Wild-type Lkb1 specifically activated AMPK
in SCC cells, as reflected by increased phosphorylation of AMPKa
Thr172 and of the AMPK target ACC Ser79 (Fig. 5B). Consistent with
AMPK activation, mTOR activity was repressed by wild-type Lkb1

as shown by a reduction in levels of p-S6K. P-S6 levels were also
reduced 24 to 48 h after Lkb1 restoration; however, this effect was
transient, and elevations in p-S6 were noted at later time points
(>96 h).
To test the requirement of AMPK in growth arrest, we
introduced adenoviruses expressing dominant-negative AMPK into
the SCC cells and assessed whether Lkb1 arrest was abrogated. DNAMPK effectively inactivated AMPK signaling because it blocked
Lkb1-induced phosphorylation of AMPK and of the AMPK target
ACC. Correspondingly, DN-AMPK rescued the Lkb1-mediated
down-regulation of p-S6K and p-S6 seen at early time points.
On the other hand, despite this disruption in AMPK signaling,

signaling because p-AKT levels were elevated after Lkb1 expression
(Fig. 6B), a finding consistent with reduced mTOR/S6K signaling
and a resulting loss of feedback inhibition insulin-like growth
factor/PI3K signaling (47). Lkb1 expression led to an acute and
sustained decrease in p-MEK, whereas p-ERK levels were only
transiently decreased, suggesting that Lkb1 represses the RAFMAPK pathway at a level of upstream of p-ERK (Fig. 6B). Finally, we
found that Lkb1 restoration resulted in the pronounced activation
of p38, indicating that Lkb1 restoration provokes an acute stress
response in these cells.
Role of the Rb and p53 pathways in Lkb1-induced growth
arrest. Intact Rb and p53 pathway function are broadly required
for senescence responses. Lkb1 restoration did not lead to
increased expression of p53 or p21, a p53 target gene indicating
that arrest provoked by Lkb1 was likely to be p53-independent
(Fig. 6C, top) and data not shown. In contrast, the wild-type
Lkb1-expressing SCC cells showed increased levels of the hypophosphorylated, activated form of Rb and decreases in hyperphosphorylated, inactivated Rb (Fig. 6C, bottom). Rb phosphorylation
is controlled by cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes.
Both wild-type and kinase-dead Lkb1 induced expression of the

DN-AMPK did not rescue the growth arrest phenotype (Fig. 5C, left
and right). Along these lines, the pharmacologic AMPK inhibitor
compound C was unable to rescue Lkb1-mediated growth arrest
(data not shown). These results indicate that AMPK-mTOR
signaling is not required for Lkb1-induced growth inhibition of
SCC cell lines and, therefore, may not be critical for tumor suppression downstream of Lkb1.
Lkb1-mediated growth arrest shows features of oncogeneinduced senescence. Oncogene-induced senescence refers to a
specific type of growth arrest that occurs in primary cells in
response to strong oncogenic signals and, therefore, serves as a
barrier to tumor progression (44). We noted that Lkb1-arrested
SCC cells became enlarged, took on a flattened appearance, were
frequently binucleated, and stained for senescence-associated
h-galactosidase, indicating that wild-type Lkb1 restored a senescence response in these cancer cells (Fig. 6A).
Oncogene-induced senescence is associated with feedback
signals that inactivate the RAF–MAP kinase (MAPK) and PI3KAKT pathways, with the induction of p38-mediated oxidative stress
responses (45, 46). Western blot analysis showed that Lkb1mediated growth arrest did not require inactivation of PI3K

Carcinogen-Induced Tumors in Lkb1 Mutant Mice

CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor p16Ink4a, whereas wild-type Lkb1-expressing
cells showed a specific reduction in cyclin D1 levels at both early
and late time points (Fig. 6C and data not shown). These data
indicate that Lkb1-induced growth arrest is associated with
activation of Rb and a corresponding altered balance of negative
and positive regulators of the Rb checkpoint.
We sought to directly test the requirement for the Rb and p53
pathways in Lkb1-mediated growth arrest of SCC cells by
expression of viral oncogenes that inactivate these pathways.
Before introduction of Lkb1 retroviruses, the SCC cells were
transduced with retroviruses encoding the human papilloma virus
proteins E6 (to inactivate p53), E7 (to inactivate Rb), or both E6
and E7. The expression of E6 had no effect on Lkb1-induced arrest
(Fig. 6E, top), whereas expression of either E7 alone or E6 and E7
led to a partial rescue of this growth arrest phenotype (Fig. 6E,
bottom and data not shown). These results suggest that Lkb1

suppression of SCC proliferation involves the Rb function, but not
p53 function, and that additional pathways are required to mediate
Lkb1 activity.

Discussion
In this study, we describe the development of genetic models
that show an important role of Lkb1 in suppression of carcinogeninduced tumorigenesis. Mice with germ line heterozygous mutations of Lkb1, or with selective deletion of Lkb1 in the epidermis,
were highly prone to the development of DMBA-induced SCC.
Restoration of wild-type Lkb1 in tumor-derived SCC cell lines
resulted in a senescence-like growth arrest that involved Rb
function but was independent of the p53 and AMPK pathways.
This genetic model and associated cell lines provide a framework
to elucidate the mechanisms of Lkb1-dependent suppression of

controls for p21 induction. Bottom, the
Rb pathway is activated by Lkb1 (lane 2 )
as reflected by loss of p-Rb-S795, an
increase in hypophosphorylated Rb, and
a decrease in cyclin D1 relative to GFP or

phenotype (bottom ). Error bars are

ations that reduce ROS production or that bypass these
checkpoints can result in escape from senescence. We noted that
Lkb1 restoration in SCC cell lines was associated with induction of
p38 suggesting that Lkb1 provokes an acute stress response. We
speculate that the tumor suppressor role of Lkb1 may involve
induction of senescence in cells receiving aberrant growth signals.
Based on the requirement of Lkb1 in squamous tumor
suppression, it was surprising that mice with epidermal specific
deletion of Lkb1 showed largely normal skin development. The
overall architecture of the skin was not impaired in these mice, and
the normal expression of keratin-1, keratin-14, and involucrin
indicated that Lkb1 mutant keratinocytes underwent normal
differentiation. The prominent increase in SCC development in
the context of DMBA exposure may indicate that Lkb1 plays a
particular role in restraining proliferation in response to chemical
carcinogens or more broadly to stresses that result in increased cell
turnover. Such a role could account for the strong association
between Lkb1 mutations and smoking-associated cancers.

epithelial cancers and may uncover specific roles for Lkb1 in
response to environmental carcinogens.
We observed that the wild-type Lkb1 allele was inactivated in all
DMBA-induced SCC from Lkb1+/ mice and that absence of Lkb1
in the epidermis led to greatly accelerated SCC progression (SCC
latency was 15 weeks in Lkb1+/ mice and 7 weeks in K14:Lkb1
mice). Regardless of allelic loss, all SCC lacked expression of Lkb1.
Hence, in contrast to the benign gastrointestinal polyposis
associated with Lkb1 deficiency, malignant SCC pathogenesis
seems to require biallelic inactivation of Lkb1.
The AMPK-TSC-mTOR pathway has been a prime candidate for
mediating tumor suppression downstream of the Lkb1 kinase (48).
Consistent with this, deregulation of this pathway was observed in
Lkb1 mutant SCCs in vivo and in derivative cell lines. However, the
inactivation of AMPK using pharmacologic inhibitors or expression
of dominant-negative AMPK mutants had no effect on Lkb1induced growth arrest in SCC cell lines. The results indicate that in
Lkb1-deficient cancers, pathways other than AMPK-TSC-mTOR are
likely to be the critical downstream effectors of Lkb1. It remains
possible that deregulation of this pathway may be important for
the initiating stages of Lkb1 mutant tumors and dispensable in the
later stages of cancer progression.
Our demonstration that Lkb1 restoration causes senescence in
SCC cell lines is notable in light of our previous observation that
Lkb1 forms a barrier to passage-induced senescence in primary
MEFs. Senescence in primary cells arises due to the generation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are genotoxic and provoke Rb
and p53-dependent checkpoint responses (44, 45). Genetic alter-
