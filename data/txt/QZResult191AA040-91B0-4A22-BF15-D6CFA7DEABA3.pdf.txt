BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of the genomic grade index for
lymph node-negative and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers of Japanese women treated with adjuvant
hormonal therapy alone, as well as the relation between genomic grade index and pathological complete response (CR)
to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Genomic grade index was determined by DNA microarray (U133plus2.0;
Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif) in tumor tissues obtained from lymph node-negative and ER-positive breast cancers (n ¼
105) treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy alone or in breast tumor biopsy specimens (n ¼ 84, Mammotome)
obtained before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel followed by 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphomide) to
investigate the prognostic and predictive values of genomic grade index. RESULTS: Recurrence-free survival of patients
with high genomic grade index tumors was significantly (P < .001) lower than that of patients with low genomic grade
index tumors (55% vs 88%, 10 years after surgery). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that genomic grade index was
the most important and significant predictive factor for disease recurrence (P ¼ .013) independently of other prognostic
factors, including tumor size, histological grade, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth receptor 2, and Ki67.
High genomic grade index tumors showed a significantly (P ¼ .022) higher pathological CR rate for neoadjuvant chemotherapy than low genomic grade index tumors (31.9% [15 of 47] vs 10.8% [4 of 37]). CONCLUSIONS: Genomic grade
index is a powerful prognostic factor for lymph node-negative and ER-positive tumors treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy alone, and high genomic grade index tumors are more likely to respond to chemotherapy. Genomic grade
index also appears to be very useful for decision making regarding the need for adjuvant chemotherapy for lymph

It is very important to determine highly accurate patient prognosis to implement personalized medicine for breast cancer
patients. Lymph node-negative and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients show a relatively favorable prognosis when treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy alone, but about 20% of them ultimately develop recurrence 10 years
after surgery. To reduce the recurrence rate, the majority of such patients are therefore treated in daily practice with not
only adjuvant hormonal therapy but also adjuvant chemotherapy, although adjuvant chemotherapy is considered to be
unnecessary for most of them. Currently the most important clinical question in this regard, among breast cancer
clinicians and researchers, is which patients with lymph node-negative and ER-positive tumors can be safely spared
adjuvant chemotherapy. In clinical practice, patient prognosis is estimated based on the results of conventional histological
examination of tumor size, histological grade, and biomarkers such as ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2), of which histological grade has been repeatedly shown to be significantly prognostic.
There is no doubt that lymph node-negative and ER-positive patients with histological grade 3 tumors show a poor
prognosis, and those with histological grade 1 tumors a good prognosis, so that histological grade 3 tumors are usually

treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy plus chemotherapy and histological grade 1 tumors with adjuvant hormonal therapy alone. The clinically important problem
concerning histological grade is that as many as 50% of
tumors are classified as histological grade 2 tumors, which
are associated with a prognosis intermediate between
histological grade 1 and histological grade 3 tumors.
Histological grade is thus unlikely to provide a clear
answer as to the indication of adjuvant chemotherapy for
about half of all lymph node-negative and ER-positive
patients. Another problem with histological grade classification is that it is subjectively determined by pathologists
and thus can differ depending on the pathologist.
To overcome such drawbacks of histological grade
classification, the genomic grade index has been developed, which can classify breast tumors into high genomic
grade index and low genomic grade index tumors by
analyzing the expression of 97 genes. These genes were
selected by using DNA microarray to compare the gene
expression profile of histological grade 1 tumors with that
of histological grade 3 tumors. With this index, the majority of histological grade 3 tumors are classified into high
genomic grade index tumors and the majority of histological grade 1 tumors into low genomic grade index tumors,
whereas about half of histological grade 2 tumors are
classified into high genomic grade index tumors and the
other half into low genomic grade index tumors. Several
studies have shown that patients with high genomic grade
index tumors show a significantly poorer prognosis than
those with low genomic grade index tumors in the lymph
node-negative and ER-positive subset treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy (tamoxifen) alone.1-3
These results seem to suggest that genomic grade
index would be useful for decision making as to whether
adjuvant chemotherapy should be added to adjuvant hormonal therapy for lymph node-negative and ER-positive
breast cancers. In the study presented here, we therefore
attempted to confirm the prognostic value of genomic
grade index for Japanese women with lymph node-negative and ER-positive breast cancers. The prognostic value
of genomic grade index has been examined for Caucasians
only and not for Asians. The finding that the biological
characteristics including patient prognosis are different
for these 2 groups indicates the need to confirm the prognostic value of genomic grade index for Japanese women.
In addition, we assessed the prognostic value of genomic
grade index in comparison with that of HER2 and Ki67,
because the previous studies of genomic grade index did
not always include these biomarkers, although both are

widely used in current practice. Furthermore, it has
been reported very recently that high genomic grade
index tumors are associated with a better response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy as compared with low genomic
grade index tumors.4 In our study, we therefore also
evaluated the relation between genomic grade index
and pathological complete response (CR) to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Tumors
During the period from 1996 to 2005, 250 patients with
lymph node-negative and ER-positive invasive breast
cancer underwent breast-conserving surgery followed by
radiation therapy or mastectomy and were treated with
adjuvant hormonal therapy alone. Of these patients, fresh
tumor samples were obtained from 105 patients whose
tumors were not too small for sampling and who
consented to this study. Patient characteristics are shown
in Table 1 (genomic grade index and prognosis study). Of
these 105 patients, 68 were treated postoperatively with
tamoxifen (20 mg/d) or toremifene (40 mg/d) for 5 years,
28 with goserelin (3.75 mg/4 weeks) plus tamoxifen
(20 mg/d), and 9 with anastrozole (1 mg/d). Tamoxifen,
toremifene, and anastrozole were administered for 5 years
or until recurrence before 5 years, whereas goserelin was
administered for 2 years or until recurrence before 2 years.
Tumor samples obtained at surgery were snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen and kept at 80 C until use. Informed
consent for the study was obtained from each patient
before surgery.
For an additional study (genomic grade index and
chemoresponse study), 84 patients with stage II-III primary breast cancer and characteristics as shown in Table 1
were enrolled. These patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with P-FEC (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2
weekly for 12 cycles followed by 5-fluorouracil [500 mg/
m2]/epirubicin [75 mg/m2]/cyclophosphamide [500 mg/
m2] on Day 1 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) during the period
2002 to 2008. Before neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all of
these patients underwent tumor biopsy with a vacuumassisted core biopsy instrument (8G; Mammotome HH
Ethicon Endosurgery; Johnson and Johnson Company,
Langhorne, Pa) under ultrasonographic guidance for histological examination and gene expression analysis. Tumor samples for histological examination were fixed in
10% buffered formaldehyde, and those for gene expression analysis were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept

RNA Extraction and Gene
Expression Profiling
In the genomic grade index and prognosis study, RNA
was extracted from 105 tumor samples obtained at surgery
with the aid of the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN
Sciences, Germantown, Md). RNA (1 lg; RIN value >6)
was used for generation of second-strand cDNA, and
cRNA was amplified with the Oligo dT primer, then biotinylated and fragmented with One-Cycle Target Labeling and control reagents (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif),
followed by hybridization to U133 Plus 2.0 array overnight (17 hours) according to the manufacturer’s proto-

474

col. Finally, the hybridized DNA microarray was
fluorescence stained with GeneChipFluidics Station 450
(Affymetrics), and scanned with the GeneChip Scanner
3000 (Affymetrics).
In the genomic grade index and chemoresponse
study, Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) was used to
extract RNA from the 84 tumor biopsy samples obtained
with Mammotome for the additional study of sensitivity
to chemotherapy. Presence of tumor cells in these biopsy
samples was estimated by histological confirmation of
their presence in the adjacent tumor biopsy samples. RNA
(50 ng) was used for generation of second-strand cDNA,
and cRNA was amplified with a random primer (WTOvation FFPE RNA Amplification System V2; NuGEN,
Cincinnati, Ohio). Next, the amplified cRNA was

biotinylated and fragmented with the Flow Ovation
cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGEN), and hybridized to a
DNA microarray (Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array;
Affymetrics) overnight (17 hours) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The hybridized DNA microarray was
then fluorescence stained with GeneChip Fluidics Station
450, and scanned with the GeneChip Scanner 3000.
Informed consent was obtained from each patient before
tumor biopsy with Mammotome.
Determination of Genomic Grade Index
Genomic grade index was calculated according to the
method of Sotiriou et al1 using the gene expression data
obtained by DNA microarray. In brief, all probe sets of
the U133 Plus 2.0 array were normalized by the robust
multiarray average method, and the 128 probe sets (representing 97 genes) listed in the article of Sotiriou et al1
were used to calculate the genomic grade index score for
each sample by using the same formula described in their
article. A threshold of zero was used for categorization of
high genomic grade index and low genomic grade index.
The same method was used for calculation of genomic
grade index in the prognosis study and in the chemoresponse study.
Histological Evaluation of Response
to Chemotherapy
After P-FEC, the patients underwent breast-conserving
surgery or mastectomy. Pathological response to P-FEC
was evaluated by using the specimens obtained at surgery,
which were cut into 5 lm slices and stained with hematoxylin and eosin sections to determine the presence or
absence of tumor cells. A complete loss of invasive tumor
cells and absence of lymph node metastasis were considered pathological CR irrespective of the presence or
absence of ductal carcinoma in situ components. Pathological examinations including the determination of
response to chemotherapy, histological grade, and immunohistochemistry (ER, PR, Ki67, HER2) were done by
well-trained pathologists, who were blinded to the results
of genomic grade index and prognosis.
Immunohistological Examination
ER, PR, and Ki67 in tumor samples obtained with Mammotome before neoadjuvant chemotherapy were immunohistochemically examined with a previously described
method.5 ER and PR were defined as positive when
10% of the tumor cells were positive for immunohistochemical staining (ER: Clone 6F11; Ventana Japan K.K.,

Cancer

February 1, 2011

Tokyo, Japan; PR: Clone16; SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
Ki67 was defined as positive when 20% of tumor cells
stained positive.6 The cutoff value of 20% for Ki67 was
used, because this value was found to be optimal for the
differentiation between high-risk and low-risk groups for
disease recurrence as well as the differentiation between
responders and nonresponders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P-FEC) in this study.
HER2 was determined by immunohistochemistry
(Antihuman c-erbB-2 polyclonal antibody; Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan) or FISH (PathVysion HER-2
DNA Probe Kit; Vysis/Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines,
Ill). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) scoring was
performed by counting fluorescence signals in at least 60
malignant cell nuclei per case, and for each specimen, the
ratio of HER2 gene signals to chromosome 17 centromere
signals (FISH ratio) was calculated. When a tumor
showed þ3 immunostaining or an FISH ratio 2.0,
it was considered HER2 positive, and the histological
grade was determined with the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson
grading system.7
Statistical Analysis
Relations between genomic grade index and the various
clinicopathological parameters were evaluated by chisquare test. The Cox proportional hazard model was used
for univariate and multivariate analysis of the various
prognostic parameters. All statistical analyses consisted of
2-sided tests. Significance was judged from a 5% standard.
Except for 1 step in the preliminary treatment, for which
Affymetrix Expression Console software was used, all
analyses were performed with the aid of R software
(http://www.R-project.org/) and the Bioconductor package (http://www.bioconductor.org/).

RESULTS

(n ¼ 105) treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy alone
were analyzed in terms of their gene expression profile by
DNA microarray and classified into high genomic grade

(Fig. 1). Of the 29 histological grade 1 tumors, 25
(86.2%) were classified as low genomic grade index
tumors and 12 (85.7%) of the 14 histological grade 3
tumors as high genomic grade index tumors. Of the 62

with high genomic grade index tumors was significantly
(P < .001) lower than for those with low genomic grade

2 tumors into high genomic grade index and low genomic

these tumors were compared (Fig. 2B). The rate for
patients with high genomic grade index tumors was significantly (P ¼ .012) lower than for those with low genomic

indicating that genomic grade index can help to clearly
differentiate high-risk from low-risk tumors even among

Genomic Grade Index and Response
to Chemotherapy
The gene expression profile of the tumor biopsy samples
(n ¼ 84) obtained before neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(P-FEC) were analyzed by means of DNA microarray
for classification into high genomic grade index and
low genomic grade index tumors (Fig. 3). Of the 7
histological grade 1 tumors, 5 (71.4%) were classified
into low genomic grade index tumors, and of the 17

Cancer

histological grade 3 tumors, 14 (82.4%) were classified
into high genomic grade index tumors. Of the 60
histological grade 2 tumors, 29 (48.3%) were classified
into low genomic grade index tumors and 31 (51.7%)
into high genomic grade index tumors.
The pathological CR rate to P-FEC was significantly
(P ¼ .022) higher for high genomic grade index (31.9%)
tumors than low genomic grade index tumors (10.8%)
(Table 3). The subset analysis according to ER status
showed that the pathological CR rate was higher for high
genomic grade index tumors than low genomic grade
index tumors both in the ER-positive subset (17.4% vs
4.0%) and in the ER-negative subset (45.8% vs 25.0%),
although the difference was not statistically significant.
Disease-free survival of these 84 patients according
to genomic grade index is shown in Figure 4 (median
follow-up period, 28 months; range, 1-56 months). There
was no significant difference in RFS between high
genomic grade index tumors and low genomic grade
index tumors.

DISCUSSION
In the study presented here, we evaluated the prognostic
value of genomic grade index for lymph node-negative
and ER-positive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy alone. We were able to demonstrate that in the case of Japanese breast cancers, most
histological grade 3 tumors can be classified into high
genomic grade index tumors and most histological grade
1 tumors into low genomic grade index tumors, as was
previously reported for Caucasian breast cancers. High
genomic grade index tumors were more likely to be ER
negative, PR negative, HER2 positive, and Ki67 positive,
and are thus considered to possess a biologically aggressive
phenotype. Accordingly, prognosis for high genomic

grade index tumors was significantly poorer than for low
genomic grade index tumors, and more importantly,
histological grade 2 tumors could be clearly differentiated
into high genomic grade index tumors with poor prognosis and low genomic grade index tumors with good prognosis. All these findings for the association between
genomic grade index and prognosis for Japanese breast
cancers are consistent with those reported for Caucasian
breast cancer patients, indicating that genomic grade
index determined by the 97-gene signature for molecular
classification of breast tumors is a statistically robust
method regardless of ethnicity.
Because prognosis for lymph node-negative and ERpositive breast tumors is usually estimated by using tumor
size, histological grade, PR, HER2, and more recently
Ki67, it seems important to compare genomic grade index
with these conventional prognostic parameters to determine the independent prognostic value of genomic grade
index. However, such a comparison has never been done
in previously reported studies. We therefore conducted a
multivariate analysis of genomic grade index and conventional prognostic factors and were able to show that
genomic grade index is a highly significant prognostic
factor independent of the other, conventional prognostic
factors. These results seem to indicate that genomic grade
index would be very useful for decision making as to
whether adjuvant chemotherapy should be added to
adjuvant hormonal therapy for lymph node-negative and
ER-positive breast cancers.
Prognostic signatures (MammaPrint and Oncotype
DX) other than genomic grade index have also been
reported, and all these signatures appear to have a similar
prognostic performance, but are likely to be limited to
ER-positive tumors.8 The common and most prominent
characteristic among these prognostic signatures is the
high expression of the genes responsive for cell proliferation. Ki67 is the most reliable marker for cell proliferation
among those currently available, and we have been able to

show that, as expected, high genomic grade index tumors
are associated with Ki67-positive tumors. However, we
believe that the prognostic value of genomic grade index is
stronger than that of Ki67, because the multivariate analysis has clearly shown that genomic grade index is most
strongly associated with prognosis independently of other
parameters, including Ki67. These results seem to suggest
that genomic grade index can identify cell proliferation
more accurately than Ki67 or that genomic grade index
can identify not only cell proliferation but also other
biological features related to metastases.
Because high genomic grade index tumors are associated with high proliferation, and highly proliferating
tumors can be expected to respond well to chemotherapy,
we also investigated, as part of this study, the association
of genomic grade index with pathological CR rates in the
neoadjuvant setting, and were able to show that high
genomic grade index tumors are significantly (P ¼ .022)
associated with a high pathological CR rate. This tendency was also observed in the ER-positive tumor subset.
These results are essentially consistent with those reported
very recently by Liedtke et al, who have shown that high
genomic grade index breast cancer tumors are associated
with a high pathological CR rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel followed by 5-fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide.4 All these results
taken together indicate that, in the lymph node-negative
and ER-positive subset, high genomic grade index tumors

show a poor prognosis, but at the same time they are
thought to have a relatively higher sensitivity to P-FEC.
Therefore, it is speculated that prognosis of patients with
such tumors can be improved by addition of adjuvant
chemotherapy (P-FEC) to adjuvant hormonal therapy.
This speculation needs to be proven in future study.
We found that there was no significant difference in
RFS between high genomic grade index tumors and low
genomic grade index tumors (Fig. 4). Because high
genomic grade index tumors have a worse baseline prognosis as compared with low genomic grade index tumors,
a modest increase in sensitivity to P-FEC associated with
high genomic grade index tumors might be unable to
translate into the improvement of their prognosis over
low genomic grade index tumors. Interestingly, Liedtke
et al reported that high genomic grade index tumors
showed a worse prognosis than low genomic grade index
tumors in the ER-positive subset.4 Therefore, it is considered that genomic grade index modestly predicts chemosensitivity in patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
but its impact on prognosis still remains to be clarified.
In the prognosis study of 105 patients, we used
poly-T primers for RNA amplification, but in the chemoresponse study of 84 patients, we used the Ovation
method (random primers) because of a small sample
volume of Mammotome specimens. It is possible that
determination of genomic grade index would be affected
by the different chemical approaches to RNA amplification.9,10 However, concordance between histological
grade 1 and low genomic grade index and between histological grade 3 and high genomic grade index was similarly high both in the prognosis study (37 of 43, 86%)
and in the chemoresponse study (19 of 24, 79%), suggesting that genomic grade index results obtained using the
Ovation method would be comparable to those obtained
using poly-T primers.
In conclusion, we were able to show that genomic
grade index is a very strong prognostic factor for lymph
node-negative and ER-positive tumors independently of
the currently available prognostic biomarkers, including
PR, HER2, and Ki67, and that high genomic grade index
tumors are more likely to respond to chemotherapy (PFEC). Thus, genomic grade index seems to represent a
helpful diagnostic tool for decision making as to the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to adjuvant hormonal
therapy for this subset of breast tumors. Very recently,
Toussaint11 et al reported that they succeeded in the
conversion of DNA microarray-based determination of
genomic grade index to a quantitative reverse-transcrip-

from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. The methods they have developed seem to have the
potential to be widely used for risk assessment of lymph
node-negative and ER-positive breast cancers.
