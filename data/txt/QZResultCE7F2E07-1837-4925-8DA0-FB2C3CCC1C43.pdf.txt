Activation of KDR leads to the activation of various downstream
signal transduction proteins, including extracellular signal-regulated
kinases, protein kinase C, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/eNOS
pathway components (4). VEGF also increases Src kinase activity,
leading to angiogenesis and breakdown of the endothelial barrier
(5, 6). KDR-mediated Src activation induces phosphorylation of
vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin at Tyr685, resulting in the
induction of angiogenesis and an increase in vascular permeability
(7). Moreover, VEGF increases FAK phosphorylation at Tyr861 via
an Src-dependent pathway, and Src inhibition impairs VEGFinduced cell migration and survival (8).
A variety of phenolic substances, particularly those present in
dietary and medicinal plants, are hypothesized to exhibit a preventive effect on a variety of diseases, including cancers (9, 10).
Capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is a pungent,
phenolic compound present in some peppers of the Capsicum
family. Because of its analgesic and antiinflammatory activities,
topical capsaicin has been used in clinical practice for the
treatment of a variety of neuropathic conditions (11). Capsaicin
is recognized for its pharmacologic and toxicologic properties in
the treatment of cancer and is known to inhibit the growth of or
kill various types of human tumor cells (12). Epidemiologic studies
have suggested that capsaicin consumption may reduce the risk
of colon cancer (13). Recently, capsaicin was shown to inhibit
tumor-induced or VEGF-induced new vessel formation in vivo (14).
However, because of its highly pungent nature, it is rarely
considered for treating angiogenesis-related diseases. Specific
capsaicin molecular mechanisms and structural characteristics
that are directly relevant to vascular functions are understudied.
In this study, we attempted to further characterize the biological
actions of capsaicinoids (Supplementary Fig. S1) in the vascularture and their underlying molecular targets. We show that capsiate
and dihydrocapsiate, the nonirritating capsaicinoids from the nonpungent red pepper cultivar CH-19 Sweet, potently inhibit VEGFinduced angiogenesis and act as antipermeability agents. Surprisingly,
biochemical experiments revealed that capsiate inhibits the
catalytic activity of Src kinase, which is a prominent target of the
VEGF receptor KDR/Flk-1. Molecular modeling revealed that
capsiate and structurally related capsaicinoids efficiently dock to
the ATP-binding region of Src through hydrogen bonding and
hydrophobic interactions. Our results indicate that capsiate has
considerable potential as a novel pharmacologic model compound
for the design and development of Src antagonists and angiogenesis inhibitors. Functional studies of capsiate will provide insights
into the biological consequences of the dietary intake of capsaicinrelated compounds.

Abstract
Capsiate, a nonpungent capsaicin analogue, and its dihydroderivative dihydrocapsiate are the major capsaicinoids of
the nonpungent red pepper cultivar CH-19 Sweet. In this
study, we report the biological actions and underlying
molecular mechanisms of capsiate on angiogenesis and
vascular permeability. In vitro, capsiate and dihydrocapsiate
inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–induced
proliferation, chemotactic motility, and capillary-like tube
formation of primary cultured human endothelial cells. They
also inhibited sprouting of endothelial cells in the rat aorta
and formation of new blood vessels in the mouse Matrigel plug
assay in response to VEGF. Moreover, both compounds
blocked VEGF-induced endothelial permeability and loss of
vascular endothelial (VE)–cadherin–facilitated endothelial
cell-cell junctions. Importantly, capsiate suppressed VEGFinduced activation of Src kinase and phosphorylation of its
downstream substrates, such as p125FAK and VE-cadherin,
without affecting autophosphorylation of the VEGF receptor
KDR/Flk-1. In vitro kinase assay and molecular modeling
studies revealed that capsiate inhibits Src kinase activity via
its preferential docking to the ATP-binding site of Src kinase.
Taken together, these results suggest that capsiate could be
useful for blocking pathologic angiogenesis and vascular
permeability caused by VEGF. [Cancer Res 2008;68(1):227–35]

Introduction
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), expressed by most
cancer cell types and certain tumor stromal cells, is a potent
proangiogenic factor that functions in tumor vascular development
(1, 2). Additionally, VEGF may play a role in several human
diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, hyperthyroidism,
atherosclerosis, and diabetic retinopathy (3). VEGF exerts its
biological effects by binding to two receptor tyrosine kinases, KDR/
Flk-1 and Flt-1, expressed on endothelial cells. The biologically
relevant VEGF signaling events are mediated mainly via KDR.

concentrations of capsiate or dihydrocapsiate (5, 10, and 25 Amol/L),
and stimulated by the addition of 50 ng/mL VEGF for 1 h. [14C]Sucrose
(50 AL at 0.8 ACi/mL; Amersham Pharmacia) was added to the upper
compartment. The amount of radioactivity that diffused into the lower
compartment after 30 min was determined using a liquid scintillation
counter.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. HUVECs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, then
preincubated with blocking solution of PBS containing 5% normal goat
serum and 0.05% Tween 20. Cells were labeled with anti–VE-cadherin
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at room temperature, rinsed in
PBS, and incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Lab)
for 90 min at room temperature. Samples were examined with a
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss).
Animal studies. Animals were maintained in a laminar airflow cabinet
under specific pathogen-free conditions in a 12-h light-dark cycle. All
animal experiments were carried out in accordance with University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.
Aortic ring assay. Aortas were harvested from 6-week-old male SpragueDawley rats as previously described (17). Plates (48-well) were coated with
120 AL of Matrigel, and after it had gelled, the aortic rings were placed in
the wells and sealed in place with an overlay of 50 AL of Matrigel. VEGF,
with or without capsiate or dihydrocapsiate, was added to the wells in a
final volume of 200 AL of human endothelial serum-free medium
(Invitrogen). As a control, medium alone was assayed. On day 6, cells were
fixed and stained with Diff-Quick. The assay was scored from 0 (least
positive) to 5 (most positive) in a double-blinded manner. Each data point
was assayed in sextuplet.
In vivo Matrigel plug assay. Matrigel plug assay was performed as
previously described (18). Briefly, 7-week-old C57/BL/6 mice (Orient Co.)
were injected s.c. with 0.6 mL of Matrigel containing the indicated amount
of capsiate or dihydrocapsiate, 100 ng VEGF, and 10 units heparin. The
injected Matrigel rapidly formed a single, solid gel plug. After 6 days, the
skin of the mouse was easily pulled back to expose the Matrigel plug, which
remained intact. To identify infiltrating endothelial cells, immunohistochemistry was performed with anti–CD-31 antibody. Seven mice were used
for each group.
Immunoprecipitation. HUVECs were lysed in 1 mL of lysis buffer
[20 mmol/L Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mmol/L EDTA, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 1%
Triton X-100]. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000g for
10 min, and the resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated with
either 1 Ag/mL anti-KDR/Flk-1 antibody, anti-p125FAK antibody, anti–VEcadherin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and antiphosphotyrosine
(PY-20) antibody (BD Biosciences) at 4jC for overnight, followed by the
addition of protein A–agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) at 4jC for 1 h.
Immunoprecipitates were washed thrice with lysis buffer, solubilized in
SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing h-mercaptoethanol, and further
analyzed by Western blotting.
In vitro Src kinase assay. The kinase activity of endogenous Src kinase
was assayed as described according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Upstate Biotechnology). In brief, supernatant containing 150 Ag of protein
per sample derived from endothelial cells stimulated with VEGF in the
absence or presence of inhibitors was incubated with 1 Ag of Src
monoclonal antibody at 4jC overnight in a final volume of 500 AL. Immunoprecipitated Src was incubated under optimized buffer [25 mmol/L TrisHCl buffer (pH 7.2), 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 150 Amol/L of substrate peptide
(KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK), 100 Amol/L ATP, 5 mmol/L glycerol phosphate,
0.1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmol/L DTT, and 0.2 ACi of [g-32P]
ATP] in a total volume of 30 AL for 10 min at 30jC with agitation. The
reaction was stopped by adding 20 AL of 40% trichloroacetic acid, and a
25-AL aliquot was transferred onto the center of a numbered P81 paper
square. The assay squares were washed thrice for 5 min each with 0.75%
phosphoric acid and once with acetone. The assay squares were transferred
to a scintillation vial, 5 mL of scintillation mixture were added, and the level
of radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. The activity of
the recombinant enzyme was determined by using 20 ng of purified active

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cell
(HUVEC) were isolated from human umbilical cord veins by collagenase
treatment, as described previously (15), and used in passages 2 to 7. The
cells were grown in M199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin,
3 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (Upstate Biotechnology), and
5 units/mL heparin at 37jC under a humidified 95%:5% (v/v) mixture of
air and CO2. Capsiate and dihydrocapsiate were dissolved in DMSO and
diluted in cell culture medium. Recombinant human VEGF was purchased
from Upstate Biotechnology. Matrigel, cell culture reagents, and most other
biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise
specified.
Endothelial cell proliferation assay. [3H]Thymidine incorporation
assays were carried out as described previously (16). Briefly, HUVECs were
seeded at a density of 2  104 cells per well in gelatin-coated 24-well
plates. After 24 h, they were washed twice with M199 and incubated for
6 h in M199 containing 1% FBS. The cells were preincubated for 30 min
with various concentrations of capsiate or dihydrocapsiate and stimulated
by incubating with 10 ng/mL VEGF for 30 h, followed by 0.5 ACi/mL of
[3H]thymidine (Amersham) for 6 h. High–molecular weight DNAs were
precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4jC for 30 min. After two
washes with ice-cold H2O, labeled DNA was solubilized in 0.2 N NaOH/
0.1% SDS and counted by liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer/
Wallac).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
test was carried out as described previously (17). Briefly, HUVECs were
seeded at a density of 2  104 cells per well in gelatin-coated 24-well plates.
After 24 h, cells were washed twice with M199 and incubated for 6 h in
M199 containing 1% FBS. Cells were preincubated for 30 min with various
concentrations of capsiate or dihydrocapsiate and stimulated by the
addition of 10 ng/mL VEGF for 48 h, followed by a colorimetric assay based
on the uptake of MTT by viable cells.
Endothelial cell migration assay. Chemotactic motility of HUVECs
was assayed using Transwell (Corning Costar) with 6.5-mm diameter
polycarbonate filters (8-Am pore size) as described previously (16). Briefly,
the lower surface of the filter was coated with 10 Ag of gelatin. Fresh
M199 medium (1% FBS) containing VEGF was placed in the lower wells.
The cells were trypsinized and suspended at a final concentration of
1  106 cells/mL in M199 containing 1% FBS. Various concentrations of
capsiate or dihydrocapsiate were given to the cells for 30 min at room
temperature before seeding. One hundred microliters of the cell
suspension were loaded into each of the upper wells, and the chamber
was incubated at 37jC for 4 h. The cells were fixed and stained with H&E.
Nonmigrating cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by
wiping with a cotton swab, and chemotaxis was quantified with an optical
microscope (200) by counting cells that had migrated to the lower side
of the filter.
In vitro capillary-like tube formation assay. Tube formation was
assessed as previously described (16). Briefly, 250 AL of growth factor–
reduced Matrigel (10 mg protein/mL; Collaborative Biomedical Products)
was pipetted into a 16-mm diameter tissue culture well and polymerized for
30 min at 37jC. HUVECs incubated in M199 containing 1% FBS for 6 h were
harvested after trypsin treatment and resuspended in M199 containing 1%
FBS. Various concentrations of capsiate or dihydrocapsiate were added to
the cells for 30 min at room temperature before seeding. Cells were plated
onto the layer of Matrigel at a density of 1.8  105 cells per well, followed by
the addition of 10 ng/mL VEGF. After 20 h, the cultures were photographed
(200). The area covered by the tube network was determined using an
optical imaging technique, in which pictures of the tubes were scanned
in Adobe Photoshop, and quantified using Image-Pro Plus (Media
Cybermetics).
[14C]Sucrose permeability assay. HUVECs were plated onto a
Transwell filter. After reaching confluence, HUVECs were incubated with
M199 containing 1% FBS for 3 h, treated for 30 min with various

form of Src kinase (Upstate Biotechnology). The rest of the assay was
conducted as described above.
Molecular modeling. The coordinates of human protooncogene
tyrosine-protein kinase Src were obtained from the refined X-ray crystal
structure of 2H8H.pdb (19), which is available from the Protein Data Bank.
The protein structure was prepared using the Biopolymer Structure
Preparation Tool in the SYBYL molecular modeling program (Tripos) and
used for flexible docking studies with Surflex (20), implemented in SYBYL,
after extraction of the crystal ligand. The crystal ligand was used to define
the active site for Surflex (using ligand mode), which uses an idealized
active site called a protomol, built from the hydrogen-containing protein
mol2 file and based on protein residues that line the active site using
standard variables. The three-dimensional structures of tested compounds
were generated with Concord and energy minimized using the MMFF94s
force field (method, Powell; termination gradient, 0.05 kcal/mol Å; max
iterations, 1,000,000) in SYBYL. Surflex docking of ligand was run using
default settings (except additional starting conformations per molecule
of 5), and 30 poses for each ligand were analyzed. All computational studies
were performed with the Tripos SYBYL molecular modeling program
package, version 7.3.3, on a Linux (RHEL 4.0 Intel Xeon processor 5050)
workstation.
Statistical analysis. The data are presented as mean F SE, and
statistical comparisons between groups were performed using one-way
ANOVA followed by Student’s t test.

Results
Capsiate and dihydrocapsiate inhibit VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells. To assess the antiangiogenic activity
of capsiate and dihydrocapsiate in vitro, their inhibitory effects on
VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells were first evaluated
by MTT assay. Both compounds inhibited VEGF-induced HUVEC
proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with half-maximal
inhibition at f10 Amol/L (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, both compounds
significantly blocked VEGF-induced DNA synthesis in HUVECs
(Fig. 1B). These inhibitory effects were not due to cytotoxicity
because capsiate and dihydrocapsiate had no effect on the normal
growth of HUVECs devoid of VEGF stimulation up to 50 Amol/L
(data not shown). The activity of capsiate and dihydrocapsiate
were comparable with those of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin
(data not shown). We further examined the effects of capsiate and
dihydrocapsiate on cell cycle progression by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting. VEGF induced HUVEC S-phase entry, whereas addition
of capsiate and dihydrocapsiate markedly reduced S-phase entry
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). The transition of cells from G1-S is, in
part, regulated by cyclin D1. Consistently, when HUVECs were
treated with VEGF, the protein levels of cyclin D1 increased, and

with various concentrations (1, 5, 10, or 25 Amol/L) of capsiate (Cap ) or dihydrocapsiate (D-cap ) before exposure to VEGF (10 ng/mL). After 48 h, proliferation was
quantified by MTT assay. B, HUVECs were treated the same as in A , except for 36-h stimulation. [3H]Thymidine was present during the last 6 h of incubation.
Incorporated [3H]thymidine into the cells was quantitated by scintillation counting. C, HUVECs were pretreated for 30 min with various concentrations (1, 5, 10, or
25 Amol/L) of capsiate or dihydrocapsiate before treatment with 10 ng/mL VEGF. After 4 h, chemotaxis was quantified by counting the cells that migrated to the
lower side of the filter with optical microscopy at 200 magnification. The basal migration in the absence of VEGF was 100 F 10 cells per field. D, HUVECs were
preincubated for 30 min with various concentrations of capsiate or dihydrocapsiate (1, 5, 10, or 25 Amol/L). Cells were collected and replated on Matrigel-coated plates
at a density of 1.8  105 cells per well and then incubated in the absence (control) or presence of 10 ng/mL VEGF. Microphotographs were taken after 20 h
(magnification, 200). Columns, mean from three different experiments with duplicate; bars, SE (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 versus VEGF alone).

contacts. When HUVECs were treated with 50 ng/mL VEGF, the
level of VE-cadherin at cell-cell junctions was markedly decreased,
and pretreatment with capsiate or dihydrocapsiate blocked this
effect (Fig. 2B). VEGF induces VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial cells, and this event may be involved in the
loosening of cell-cell contacts in established vessels to modulate
transendothelial permeability (22). Treatment of confluent HUVECs
with VEGF significantly induced VE-cadherin phosphorylation
(Fig. 2C). Both capsiate and dihydrocapsiate inhibited this VEGFinduced effect (Fig. 2C). Together, these results suggest that capsiate
and dihydrocapsiate may inhibit VEGF-induced vascular hyperpermeability by blocking tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin.
Capsiate and dihydrocapsiate inhibit VEGF-induced vessel
sprouting ex vivo and angiogenesis in vivo. We further explored
the antiangiogenic activity of capsiate and dihydrocapsiate in
ex vivo and in vivo angiogenesis models. First, the sprouting of
vessels from aortic rings was investigated to determine whether
capsiate and dihydrocapsiate inhibit VEGF-induced angiogenesis
ex vivo. VEGF (20 ng/mL) significantly stimulated vessel sprouting,
and this effect was antagonized by capsiate and dihydrocapsiate
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). To determine the effect of
capsiate and dihydrocapsiate on VEGF-induced angiogenesis
in vivo, an established in vivo angiogenesis model, the mouse
Matrigel plug assay, was performed. Matrigel containing VEGF
(100 ng/mL), with or without 60 Ag/mL capsiate or dihydrocapsiate, was s.c. injected into C57/BL/6 mice. Six days later, plugs
containing VEGF alone appeared dark red (Fig. 3B). The vessels
were abundantly filled with intact RBCs, indicating the formation
of a functional vasculature inside the Matrigel via angiogenesis
induced by VEGF. In contrast, plugs containing VEGF and capsiate
or VEGF and dihydrocapsiate were pale in color, similar to Matrigel
alone, indicating no or less blood vessel formation (Fig. 3B). The
endothelial cell content inside the Matrigel plugs was quantified by

this effect was blocked by capsiate and dihydrocapsiate (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Taken together, these results suggest that
capsiate and dihydrocapsiate block VEGF-induced cell cycle
progression from G1-S via down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression.
Capsiate and dihydrocapsiate inhibit VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration and tube formation. The effects of
capsiate and dihydrocapsiate on the chemotactic motility of
HUVECs were measured by Transwell assay. Both capsiate and
dihydrocapsiate inhibited VEGF-induced migration of HUVECs in
a concentration-dependent manner, with half-maximal inhibition
at f10 Amol/L (Fig. 1C). Next, the effects of capsiate and dihydrocapsiate on endothelial cell differentiation were investigated using
two-dimensional Matrigel. When HUVECs were placed on growth
factor–reduced Matrigel in the presence of VEGF, elongated and
robust tube-like structures were formed, and many more cells were
observed compared with control. Capsiate reduced both the width
and length of the endothelial tubes induced by VEGF (Fig. 1D and
Supplementary Fig. S3). Half-maximal inhibition was achieved
below 5 Amol/L capsiate. Dihydrocapsiate exhibited a similar effect
(Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S3). These results show that
capsiate and dihydrocapsiate block VEGF-induced in vitro
angiogenesis.
Capsiate and dihydrocapsiate inhibit VEGF-induced endothelial permeability and VE-cadherin phosphorylation. We
next examined the effect of capsiate and dihydrocapsiate on VEGFinduced endothelial permeability. VEGF increased [14C]sucrose
diffusion through the pores of Transwell membranes in HUVEC
monolayer culture, and this effect was blocked by capsiate and
dihydrocapsiate in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The halfmaximal inhibition was achieved below 10 Amol/L for both
compounds. Vascular endothelial permeability is maintained by
the endothelial junction proteins VE-cadherin and occludins (21). In
confluent endothelial cells, VE-cadherin is located at cell-cell

and VEGF plus dihydrocapsiate for 6 h.
Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then
stained sequentially with anti–VE-cadherin
antibody and FITC-conjugated secondary
antibody. C, HUVECs were preincubated for
30 min with various concentrations (5, 10, or

further 30 min. VE-cadherin protein was
immunoprecipitated as described under
Materials and Methods. Precipitated proteins
were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by
immunoblotting with antibody to VE-cadherin.
The levels of VE-cadherin in whole-cell
lysates were used as an internal control.

effect of capsiate on VEGF-induced Src kinase activity in HUVECs
was determined by measuring phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416,
which leads to autoactivation. VEGF significantly increased Tyr416
phosphorylation, and this was blocked by capsiate or dihydrocapsiate in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Half-maximal
effects were obtained at a concentration of f10 Amol/L. Consistently, p125FAK, which is a known substrate of Src kinase, was
tyrosine phosphorylated by VEGF, and this effect was suppressed
by capsiate or dihydrocapsiate (Fig. 4C). Similar to capsiate,
capsaicin also inhibited VEGF-induced Tyr416 phosphorylation
and Src kinase activity (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that capsiate
and dihydrocapsiate are able to block the VEGF-induced Src/
p125FAK signaling pathway in endothelial cells.
Capsiate inhibits Src kinase activity. HUVECs were pretreated
with or without various concentrations of capsiate for 1 h before
VEGF stimulation. Then, Src kinase from cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with anti-Src antibody and subjected to an in vitro
kinase assay using the KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK peptide substrate.
VEGF significantly increased endogenous Src kinase activity, and
this was inhibited by pretreatment of capsiate in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5A). Moreover, capsiate inhibited the

CD-31 staining (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that capsiate and
dihydrocapsiate are capable of inhibiting VEGF-induced neovessel
formation in vivo.
Capsiate and dihydrocapsiate inhibit VEGF-induced Src
kinase and p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation without affecting KDR/Flk-1 autophosphorylation. VEGF induces proliferation, migration, tube formation, and permeability mainly through
activation of its cell surface receptor KDR/Flk-1 (23). To
understand the molecular mechanism by which capsaicin inhibits
VEGF-induced angiogenesis, we investigated the effect of capsiate
and dihydrocapsiate on VEGF-induced KDR/Flk-1 autophosphorylation. However, neither compound had an effect on VEGFinduced KDR/Flk-1 autophosphorylation up to 25 Amol/L (Fig. 4A),
suggesting that capsiate may inhibit angiogenesis by curbing
downstream signaling molecules of KDR/Flk-1. Previous reports
have suggested that VEGF-induced angiogenesis and endothelial
permeability involve activation of Src kinase, downstream of KDR/
Flk-1 (24, 25). Because capsiate inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis and tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, we speculated
that capsiate could exert antiangiogenic and antipermeability
actions through inhibition of Src kinase activity. Therefore, the

Figure 4. Capsiate and dihydrocapsiate
inhibit VEGF-induced Src kinase and
p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation without
affecting KDR/Flk-1 autophosphorylation.
HUVECs were pretreated for 30 min with
various concentrations (5, 10, or 25 Amol/L)
of capsiate or dihydrocapsiate and
stimulated with 10 ng/mL VEGF
(or 20 ng/mL VEGF) for 10 min. A, B,
and C, anti-KDR/Flk-1, anti-Src, and
anti-p125FAK immunoprecipitates (IP ) were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot
analysis was performed with
antiphosphotyrosine antibody (anti-PY20).
B, blots were also probed with antibody
specific to phosphorylated Src at Tyr416
(Src-pY416). D, the effect of capsaicin
on phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416
(Src-pY416) was compared with that of
capsiate. Blots are representative of three
independent experiments. Densitometric
analyses are presented as the relative

catalytic activity of purified Src kinase with an IC50 of f10 Amol/L
(Fig. 5B), and capsaicin showed a similar effect (Fig. 5B). These
data indicate that Src kinase may be a direct target for capsiate
and capsaicin.
Docking studies. To examine the direct predicted interactions
of our tested compounds with the target protein Src tyrosine
kinase, docking studies were performed. The X-ray crystal structure
of human protooncogene Src tyrosine kinase, 2H8H.pdb (19), was
used for flexible docking studies, and Surflex (20) docking very
nicely reproduced the binding mode of the crystal ligand with
RMSD of ca. 0.85 Å. Figure 6 shows the active site of Src tyrosine
kinase (with MOLCAD surface-colored by cavity depth) and
representative binding modes of the other tested compounds.
Docking studies of ATP showed that it binds to the ATP-binding
site, with its adenine moiety making hydrogen bonds with Glu339
and Met341 (Fig. 6B, i), as the previous crystal structure with an
ATP analogue showed (26). Capsiate also successfully docked into

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (1). January 1, 2008

the ATP-binding site, but interestingly, it was able to occupy the
hydrophobic pocket (near to the purine binding site) and maintain
a hydrogen bond with Met341, which seems to be a rational binding
mode (Fig. 6B, ii). In the case of capsaicin, the major binding mode
seemed to be very similar to that of capsiate (Fig. 6C, i); the minor
binding mode seemed to be possible via binding to the purine
binding site, like ATP (Fig. 6C, ii), maintaining hydrogen bonds with
Glu339 and Met341. Moreover, other capsiate-related compounds,
such as dihydrocapsiate, dihydrocapsaicin, and [6]-gingerol, were
docked and showed similar binding modes to capsiate, occupying
the hydrophobic pocket at the ATP-binding site (data not shown).
This docking study confirmed that the tested compounds could
bind to the ATP-binding site of Src tyrosine kinase. Capsiate and
its analogues were able to occupy the hydrophobic pocket, which
could be exploited to obtain selectivity among kinases. This
information provides insight into future kinase inhibitor design
for drug discovery.

Capsiate, a Novel Inhibitor of Src Kinase

Discussion

at the vanillyl group, also exhibit similar efficacy in inhibiting
VEGF-induced angiogenesis. It is worth noting that [6]-gingerol,
which is structurally similar to capsiate with respect to the
methoxyphenol moiety and the hydrocarbon backbone structure,
inhibits angiogenesis in a way that is similar to that of capsiate
(16). These results suggest that this group of phenolic compounds
may share a common target that is used for antiangiogenic
activity.
This study shows, for the first time, that capsiate and capsaicin
directly target Src kinase in endothelial cells. VEGF and VEGF
receptors are essential not only for the development of the
vasculature in mouse embryos (30, 31), but also for physiologic
and pathologic angiogenesis in the adult. A large number of
previous studies have shown that Src kinase is strongly involved in
VEGF-induced angiogenesis (6, 32). Several angiogenic signaling
molecules, including p125FAK (33) and eNOS (34), are predicted to
lie downstream of Src, which is activated upon the interaction of
VEGF with its receptor KDR/Flk-1. Blockage of Src kinase by
either pharmacologic inhibitors (35) or a dominant-interfering
mutant of Src (6) diminished VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro
and in vivo (36). Importantly, we found that capsiate and
capsaicin inhibit VEGF-induced Src kinase activity in endothelial
cells. In agreement, these capsaicinoids strongly inhibited VEGFinduced proliferation, migration, and tube formation of cultured
endothelial cells (Fig. 1), which require Src activity. Src kinase also
functions as a crucial component of the VEGF receptor signaling
pathway engaged in endothelial permeability, which is an initial
step for allowing vessel sprouting and the formation of capillary
networks during angiogenesis and is important for VEGFdependent vascular leakage under pathologic conditions (37).
Genetic studies showed that VEGF-induced vascular permeability
is impaired in Src / mice (6) and the absence of Src was
associated with a reduction in VEGF-mediated vascular permeability (38). It is known that Src kinase–dependent tyrosine
phosphorylation of VE-cadherin is involved in the loosening of
cell-cell contacts in established vessels with VEGF stimulation
(22, 36). KDR-mediated Src activation is also shown to regulate
the availability of VE-cadherin at the cell surface by promoting
its endocytosis through a Vav2/Rac/PAK signaling axis (5). In
agreement with this view, our results show that capsiate inhibits
tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, the loss of VE-cadherin–
facilitated endothelial cell-cell junctions, and the increased
endothelial permeability triggered by VEGF. Therefore, these
findings suggest that Src kinase is a rational molecular target of
capsaicinoids for modulating angiogenesis and permeability in
endothelial cells.
The present study further shows how capsiate inhibits Src
kinase. The catalytic activity of Src kinase is regulated by
phosphorylation of its tyrosine residues (39). It has two important
phosphorylation sites: autophosphorylation of Tyr416 at the
activation loop is stimulatory and phosphorylation of Tyr527 at
the COOH terminus is inhibitory (40). Our data show that capsiate
inhibits VEGF-induced Tyr416 phosphorylation of Src in endothelial
cells and subsequent Src kinase activity (Fig. 4B). Many tyrosine
kinase inhibitors have been developed and characterized based on
their interaction with the ATP-binding pocket (41). Based on the
results of molecular modeling studies, we predict that capsiate
efficiently docks to the ATP-binding pocket of Src kinase. Notably,
capsiate’s preferential binding mode in the ATP-binding pocket
was similar, but not identical, to the mode of ATP binding to the
Src kinase. Capsiate’s phenolic group occupied the hydrophobic

Phytochemicals, nonnutritive components in the plant-based
diet, have been recognized as medicinally important natural
products that possess medicinal properties to treat a variety of
diseases (27). In particular, chemoprevention by consumption of
plant-derived foods that contain edible phenolic compounds, such
as resveratrol, curcumin, gingerol, epigallocatechin gallate, and
capsaicin, is now widely considered to be an inexpensive, readily
applicable, and accessible approach to cancer control and
management (9, 28). Numerous previous studies have shown that
these compounds could block the biochemical events that are
associated with the multistage process of carcinogenesis (27, 28).
However, little is known about the precise mechanism of action of
most chemopreventive agents. Their biological effects are thought
to be exerted by the sum of several distinct mechanisms.
Recently, capsaicin was shown to be a potent angioinhibitory
compound in vitro and in vivo (14). Capsaicin possesses three
distinct structural moieties: methoxyphenol, amide, and vanillyl
groups. With the exception of the replacement of one nitrogen
atom and one hydrogen atom in the capsaicin molecule with one
oxygen atom, the capsaicin structure is identical to capsiate, a
major capsaicinoid of the sweet pepper (29). This minor variation
reflects a critical difference in pungency, and capsiate becomes
nonirritating. We showed that capsiate retains antiangiogenic
activity that is comparable with capsaicin. Moreover, dihydrocapsaicin and dihydrocapsiate, which have hydrogenated carbons

both capsiate and capsaicin sufficiently inhibited VEGF-induced
angiogenic responses and permeability at 10 Amol/L in in vitro and
ex vivo angiogenesis assays. Such concentrations did not affect
endothelial cell viability. Therefore, capsiate and capsaicin could
inhibit specific endothelial cell response to VEGF at much lower
concentrations than required for the inhibition of normal cell
growth. Because VEGF is a major inducer of the formation of
tumor vasculature (1, 2), capsiate and capsaicin could inhibit
tumor growth in vivo via their antiangiogenic activity, before their
cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. It is noteworthy that Src kinase is
involved in the expression of proangiogenic factors, such as VEGF
and interleukin-8 in various human tumor cells (46–48). Therefore,
in addition to disrupting Src kinase–mediated functions in host
endothelial cells, capsiate may suppress tumor angiogenesis by
directly acting on tumor cells to decrease production of
proangiogenic molecules.
In conclusion, we showed that capsiate exhibited potent activity
against VEGF-induced angiogenesis and vascular permeability.
Through biochemical and structural analyses, capsiate and
capsaicin were identified as specific inhibitors of Src kinase, a
crucial intracellular mediator of KDR/Flk-1 in the vasculature. The
nonpungent nature of capsiate, unlike capsaicin, could make this
compound more attractive for treating angiogenesis-dependent
and vascular leakage–dependent human diseases caused by
unwanted generation of VEGF. We present important biological
attributes of capsaicin, a compound that can be enriched by
dietary modification and daily consumption, that may prove to be
essential to the prevention of cancer.

pocket within the catalytic cleft of Src kinase, which is not directly
involved in ATP binding. It is known that resveratrol, a phenolic
compound, inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis primarily through
blocking Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin
(24). Unlike capsaicinoids, Src kinase was not a direct target for
resveratrol (24). Interestingly, curcumin, which is structurally
related to capsiate by possessing a methoxyphenol moiety, can
directly inhibit Src kinase activity (42). However, the IC50 value
of curcumin for the Src kinase activity (42) was much higher
(f50 Amol/L) than that observed in capsiate (IC50, f10 Amol/L).
These results suggest that capsaicinoids, among the dietary
antiangiogenic phytochemicals, are most likely to bind to the
active site of Src kinase. Additionally, considering that capsiate was
unable to block KDR autophosphorylation (Fig. 4), its inhibitory
action may not be universal to tyrosine kinases. The binding mode
of capsiate, which uses the hydrophobic pocket at the catalytic site
of Src kinase, may deliver some degree of specificity toward this
enzyme. Because of this specificity, we propose that capsiate and
its analogues may be novel pharmacologic agents for directly
targeting the catalytic site of Src kinase.
Many previous studies have shown that capsaicin induces
decreased cell viability and apoptosis in various tumor cells,
including HeLa, ovarian carcinoma, mammary adenocarcinoma,
HepG2 human hepatoma, C6 glioma, and promyelocytic leukemia
(HL-60) cells (43, 44). In addition, capsaicin inhibited tumor growth
in a mouse xenograft model (45). In most cases, capsaicin
effectively induced growth inhibition or apoptosis of cultured
tumor cells only at concentrations over 50 Amol/L (44). In contrast,
