Abstract
Therapeutics that induce cancer cell senescence can block cell
proliferation and promote immune rejection. However, the risk of
tumor relapse due to senescence escape may remain high due to
the long lifespan of senescent cells that are not cleared. Here, we
show how combining a senescence-inducing inhibitor of the
mitotic kinase Aurora A (AURKA) with an MDM2 antagonist
activates p53 in senescent tumors harboring wild-type 53. In the
model studied, this effect is accompanied by proliferation arrest,
mitochondrial depolarization, apoptosis, and immune clearance

of cancer cells by antitumor leukocytes in a manner reliant upon
Ccl5, Ccl1, and Cxcl9. The AURKA/MDM2 combination therapy
shows adequate bioavailability and low toxicity to the host.
Moreover, the prominent response of patient-derived melanoma
tumors to coadministered MDM2 and AURKA inhibitors offers a
sound rationale for clinical evaluation. Taken together, our work
provides a preclinical proof of concept for a combination treatment that leverages both senescence and immune surveillance to
therapeutic ends. Cancer Res; 75(1); 181–93. 2014 AACR.

Introduction

refs. 1–5). Furthermore, about half of melanoma tumors are
BRAFWT and thus are not eligible for BRAF targeted therapies.
New therapeutic options are needed for patients with BRAFWT and
BRAF inhibitor-resistant tumors.
Aurora kinase A (AURKA), an essential mitotic kinase indispensable for cell proliferation, is a promising therapeutic target in
cancer. The AURKA inhibitor MLN8237 (alisertib) is now being
evaluated in several clinical trials for melanoma and other malignancies, though as a single agent the beneﬁt has been somewhat
limited (clinicaltrials.gov; ref. 6). In our preclinical study,
MLN8237 treatment markedly slowed the growth of >75% of
patient-derived metastatic melanoma tumors independent of
BRAF and NRAS mutational status. AURKA inhibition induced
tumor senescence, but not apoptosis (7). To improve treatment
efﬁcacy, we sought to identify a potential therapeutic partner for
the AURKA inhibitor that is capable of activating death pathways
in senescent melanoma cells.
The inactivation of the proapoptotic cell fate regulator p53 is
considered indispensable for oncogenic transformation (8). In
mouse melanoma models either genetic loss or downregulation
of p53 through p14/Arf inactivation or MDM4 overexpression
cooperated with oncogenic kinases BrafV600E and Nras in melanoma tumorigenesis (9–11). Overexpression of p53 due to
Mdm4 inactivation, in turn, blocked HRAS-driven melanoma
progression (12). Thus, restoring p53 function is a viable strategy
for melanoma intervention especially because mutations and
allelic loss of TP53 are relatively rare in those malignancies
(16%–19%; refs. 13, 14).
The CDKN2A locus (INK4a/ARF) is often compromised by
deletions, promoter methylation, or genetic mutations in both
sporadic and hereditary melanoma (13, 15, 16). One of its
products, p14/ARF, is a negative regulator of MDM2 ubiquitin
ligase that controls p53 degradation (17). Loss of p14/ARF upon

Metastatic melanoma is a highly aggressive disease and one of
the most challenging malignancies to treat. MAPK pathway targeting with inhibitors of BRAF (vemurafenib and dabrafenib)
and/or MEK (trametinib) provide a therapeutic option for nonresectable melanoma tumors driven by oncogenic BRAF kinase
(BRAFV600E; ref. 1). However, the majority of patients eventually
relapse (median progression-free survival is 6 months for dabrafenib alone and 9.4 months for dabrafeneb and trametinib
combination, with a median overall survival of 23.8 months;

CDKN2A inactivation has been implicated in disabling p53
tumor-suppressor activity in melanoma, as illustrated by the
mutually exclusive pattern of CDKN2A and TP53 mutations
(13, 18). Therefore, targeting MDM2, which is downstream of
p14/ARF, could restore compromised p53 activity in melanoma.
Apart from CDKN2A inactivation, overexpression of MDM4
has also been shown to contribute to p53 inactivation in a
substantial proportion of human melanomas (11). It is plausible
that cotargeting MDM4 with MDM2 may achieve robust p53
induction in these tumors. However, currently there are no
speciﬁc inhibitors of MDM4 or dual MDM2/MDM4 inhibitors
available for clinical testing. In contrast, compounds that specifically target p53 interaction with MDM2 show promising results
in clinical trials (19). However, a recent study indicated that
MDM2 antagonism alone may not be sufﬁcient to restore p53mediated tumor suppression in melanoma. The therapeutic
efﬁcacy of MDM2 inhibition was enhanced by cotargeting BRAF
and iASPP, but complete abrogation of tumor growth was not
achieved (20).
Induction of senescence has been found to be essential for the
regression of established tumors upon genetic p53 reconstitution,
as it promotes immune-mediated tumor clearance (21). Hence,
we tested whether combining p53-activating MDM2 antagonist
with a senescence-inducing AURKA inhibitor can beneﬁt melanoma therapy.

Materials and Methods
Chemical reagents and cell culture
For in vitro studies, stock solutions of ()-Nutlin-3 (30 mmol/L)
and MLN8237 (20 mmol/L) were prepared in DMSO. The pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was obtained from Molecular
Probes (Eugene). Cisplatin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and a 10 mmol/L stock solution was prepared in DMSO. SK-Mel5,
HS294T, SK-Mel28 human melanoma cells, and B16F0 mouse
melanoma cells were obtained from the ATCC. Cells were cultured
in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL
penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.
Animal studies
Experiments were conducted in accordance with Vanderbilt
University Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines (protocol
M/10/034). To establish tumors, 2  106 SK-Mel5 or 4  104
B16F0 cells were injected s.c. in both ﬂanks of BALB/c nu/Foxn1
athymic nude mice or C57Bl/6 mice (Harlan–Sprague–Dawley),
respectively. Generation of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) was
approved by the Institutional Review Board and has been
described previously (22). Mutational status of TP53 was determined by direct exon sequencing with primers available from
IARC TP53 Database (R16, November 2012). ()-Nutlin-3 was
synthesized as described previously (23). MLN8237 was provided
by Takeda Pharmaceuticals. At least 5 mice per treatment group
were used. Drugs were given by oral gavage in 2% Klucel, 0.5%
Tween 80 [()-Nutlin-3], and water (MLN8237). MLN8237 was
administered once a day; ()-Nutlin-3 was given twice daily in
experiments with B16F0 melanoma tumors, PDXs of patients 2
and 3, and once a day on other experiments. Because of the
aggressiveness of B16F0 tumors, treatment began when they were
palpable. In all other experiments treatment began when tumors
were 100 mm3. Animal weight and tumor dimensions were
measured two to four times weekly. Tumor volumes were calcu-

lated as 0.5  length  width  width. In all animal experiments,
the endpoint was when tumors in any of the treatment groups
exceeded 15 mm in diameter, at which time mice in all treatment
groups were sacriﬁced and tumors collected for downstream
analyses, for example, Western blot analysis, ﬂow cytometry,
qPCR, immunoﬂuorescence, immunohistochemistry (IHC),
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and SA-b-Gal staining.
()-Nutlin-3 and MLN8237 pharmacokinetics
Blood and tumor samples were harvested over a time course of
24 hours after drug administration (n ¼ 4/time point).
()-Nutlin-3 concentrations were assayed by validated high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem
mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS-MS) assay (24). Detailed explanation of MLN8237 analysis and sample preparation is given in
Supplementary Experimental Procedures. ()-Nutlin-3 and
MLN8237 concentration–time data were ﬁtted by a two-compartment plasma model coupled to a perfusion-limited tumor compartment (Supplementary Fig. S1), using a nonlinear mixed
effects pharmacokinetic modeling approach implemented in
NONMEM (25). Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters are
shown in Supplementary Table S1. The proportional residual
error term was ﬁxed to 10%, tumor volume was ﬁxed to 0.339
cm3 (1.65  105 mL/kg), and tumor blood ﬂow (Qt) was ﬁxed to
5.8% of cardiac input (approximate blood ﬂow to the skin;
ref. 26). The AUC0–24 h was estimated on the basis of the
individual simulated concentration–time curves using the trapezoidal method.
Western blotting, viability, apoptosis, ﬂow cytometry, immunoﬂuorescence and SA-b-Gal analyses, and antibodies are described in detail in Supplementary Experimental Procedures.
Statistical analyses
Unless otherwise stated, ANOVA followed by the Dunnett test
for pair-wise comparisons was used. To compare mouse treatment
groups, the natural log of average tumor burden over time was
analyzed using mixed models ANOVA for repeated measures with
an AR(1) covariance structure for random effects. The log transformation was used to correct for heteroscedacity inherent in
tumor growth models. The AR(1) covariance structure was uniformly selected across all xenograft models, based on the Akaike
information criteria measure. Quadratic and interaction effects
were included as appropriate based on the likelihood ratio test.
Group means and their differences were estimated and compared
using linear contrasts. Group differences in tumor volume were
considered statistically signiﬁcant for P values smaller than their
Bonferroni correction that protects the per-experiment type I error
rate <5%. The results of the statistical comparisons are speciﬁed on
ﬁgures as  , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;  , P < 0.001; and ns, P > 0.05.

Results
MDM2 antagonism limits lifespan of senescent melanoma cells
Senescent cells can acquire resistance to certain proapoptotic
stimuli, including serum withdrawal, radiation, oxidative stress,
and treatment with DNA-damaging drugs (27–30). Notably, the
senescence-associated resistance to apoptosis has been linked to
impaired activation of p53 (29, 31). Therefore, we hypothesized
that activation of p53 in senescent cells may restore death pathway
functionality. To initiate senescence, the AURKA inhibitor
MLN8237 was used (7, 32). ()-Nutlin-3 (Nutlin-3a) was used

to induce expression of endogenous p53 by inhibiting MDM2–
p53 interaction (33). We observed dose-dependent cytotoxicity of
()-Nutlin-3 in both senescent (MLN8237 pretreated) and nonsenescent (vehicle pretreated) cells (Fig. 1A and B). MLN8237pretreated cells remained static but viable after drug withdrawal.
Notably, without p53 activation, some cells were able to escape
senescence and regain their proliferative potential, which resulted
in culture outgrowth by day 31. In contrast, all ()-Nutlin-3–
treated senescent cells died before any of them could regrow. The
induction of senescence was conﬁrmed using SA-b-Gal (senescence-associated b-galactosidase) staining (Fig. 1C). This suggests
that p53 activation prevents senescence escape by reducing the
lifespan of senescent cells. We also tested concurrent AURKA and
MDM2 inhibition. Melanoma cells remained viable after a week
of continuous exposure to MLN8237, suggesting a mostly cytostatic response (Fig. 1D and E). In contrast, p53 activation by
()-Nutlin-3 administered alone or in combination with
MLN8237, killed p53WT melanoma cells (Fig. 1E). These results
show that the reduction in viable tumor cells with combined
treatment is a result of both proliferative arrest caused by AURKA

inhibition and cell death driven by MDM2 antagonism. Importantly, ()-Nutlin-3 did not affect viability of cells expressing
nonfunctional mutated p53 (Fig. 1D) or cells with p53 knockout
(Supplementary Fig. S2A), demonstrating the lack of p53-independent/off-target effects under these experimental conditions.
p53 activation induces caspase-independent cell death in
senescent melanoma cells
Because we have previously characterized the mechanisms by
which AURKA inhibition induced melanoma senescence (7), we
focused here on consequences of AURKA inhibition combined
with MDM2 antagonism. As expected, ()-Nutlin-3–induced accumulation of p53 and its transcriptional targets p21, PUMA, BAX,
and MDM2 in p53WT cells (SK-Mel5 and Hs294T; Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. S2B). Of note, MDM2 accumulation does not cause
p53 degradation in the context of ()-Nutlin-3 treatment because
this drug interferes with the binding of MDM2 to p53. Consistent
with high speciﬁcity of this drug, the level and activity of p53
was unaffected by ()-Nutlin-3 in p53MUT SK-Mel28 cells (Fig. 2A).
Interestingly, treatment with the AURKA inhibitor induced p53

melanoma cells (Fig. 2B). p53 activates expression of key proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins, including PUMA, NOXA, and
BAX, that promote mitochondrial membrane depolarization,
leading to release of apoptotic effectors (34). Indeed, we found
that p53 activation by ()-Nutlin-3 alone and in combination

treated with ()-Nutlin-3 (Supplementary Fig. S2C). In addition,
treatment with pan-caspase inhibitor did not interfere with cytotoxic response to p53 activation (Supplementary Fig. S2D). These
data argue for a caspase-independent mechanism of ()-Nutlin3–induced apoptosis. Consistently, we found that treatment of
melanoma cells with ()-Nutlin-3–induced activation, mitochondrial release, and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF; Fig. 2D), which is a known effector of caspase-

independent apoptosis (35). Collectively, these results demonstrate that prolonged activation of p53 in melanoma cells initiates
caspase-independent programmed cell death driven by mitochondrial depolarization and AIF activation.
MDM2 and AURKA antagonists work in concert to activate p53
and block melanoma tumor growth in vivo
Xenograft of human melanoma cells was used to evaluate
responses to ()-Nutlin-3 and/or MLN8237 in vivo. Although
single-agent treatments only partially inhibited tumor progression, combined ()-Nutlin-3 and MLN8237 treatment fully

blocked tumor growth (Fig. 3A). As expected, MLN8237 inhibited
AURKA activity, shown by loss of AURKA autophosphorylation in
tumor lysates (Fig. 3B). This resulted in inhibition of cancer cell
proliferation and induction of senescence, based upon the
decrease of proliferative markers phosphorylated histone H3 and
Ki-67 and the increase in SA-b-Gal activity (Fig. 3B and C).
Consistent with our in vitro ﬁndings (Fig. 2A), MLN8237 treatment caused moderate induction of p53 (Fig. 3B). The lower of
the two bands detected by the human p53-speciﬁc antibody may
represent an alternative p53 isoform (36). Interestingly, although
in cultured cells p53 levels were greatly elevated by MDM2

inhibitor, in vivo p53 activation by ()-Nutlin-3 was modest,
resulting in limited induction of p53 target genes p21, BAX, and
apoptosis, based on AIF staining (Fig. 3B and C). To gain better
understanding of these ﬁndings, we evaluated tumor cell expression of p53. Only 11% of cells in the ()-Nutlin-3–treated tumors
had elevated p53 (compared with 3%–6% in untreated control
tumors; Supplementary Fig. S3). This is much lower than the
results obtained in vitro where 100% of cells showed strong p53
induction (Supplementary Fig. S2B). This suggests that systemic
administration of ()-Nutlin-3 may not target all tumor cells
equally, as opposed to in vitro cell culture conditions. In this case,
cells unaffected by ()-Nutlin-3–induced apoptosis would have
proliferative advantage, and therefore addition of the cytostatic
AURKA antagonist may promote ()-Nutlin-3 efﬁcacy. Indeed,
we found that p53 activation and expression of p53 targets p21
and BAX was much more robust after combined MLN8237 and
()-Nutlin-3 treatment in comparison with single-agent therapies (Fig. 3B). Up to 50% of tumor cells showed strong p53
staining in the combination treatment group (Supplementary Fig.
S3). Similar to p53 levels, about 50% of tumor cells showed
induction of the apoptosis marker AIF after combined MLN8237
and ()-Nutlin-3 treatment, compared with no more than 15%
after treatment with ()-Nutlin-3 alone (Fig. 3C). Accumulation
of the proapoptotic molecule BIMEL in the tumor lysates of the
MLN8237 and ()-Nutlin-3–treated mice conﬁrmed the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 3B). We also detected downregulation of
proliferation markers phospho-H3 and Ki67 after combined
MDM2 and AURKA inhibition consistent with higher p21 levels,
indicating enhanced antiproliferative effect (Fig. 3B and C). These
results show that MDM2 antagonism and AURKA inhibition
cooperate to activate p53, induce cell death, and inhibit cell
proliferation in vivo.
AURKA and MDM2 antagonism promotes tumor immune
inﬁltration
Immune cells have been shown to target senescent tumor
cells overexpressing p53 (21). To assess the effect of AURKA and
MDM2 inhibitors on the antitumor immune response, we used
an immunocompetent melanoma model in which B16F0
tumors are grown in syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice. In vitro, B16F0
cells showed decreased viability and induction of apoptosis in
response to treatment with either drug, but the cytotoxic effect
was most prominent with the combined treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). In vivo, MLN8237 alone partially
inhibited tumor growth whereas ()-Nutlin-3 showed no signiﬁcant antitumor activity. Strikingly, combined ()-Nutlin-3
and MLN8237 treatment elicited remarkable responses,
completely blocking growth of aggressive B16 tumors (Fig.
4A and B). Drug responses in ()-Nutlin-3 and MLN8237–
treated tumors were associated with high p53 levels and
increased expression of p53 transcriptional targets, such as
proapoptotic molecules Bax and Puma and cell-cycle arrest
mediator p21 (Fig. 4C and D).
Consistent with limited antitumor activity, p53 was not strongly induced upon treatment with ()-Nutlin-3 (Fig. 4D). Although
the resistance of B16 tumors to MDM2 inhibitor ()-Nutlin-3 has
been previously reported, the mechanism has not been determined (20). We found that microvessel density was decreased in
tumors treated with ()-Nutlin-3 alone (Supplementary Fig. S5).
This is consistent with the study showing that ()-Nutlin-3 limits
vessel formation in vivo by inhibiting migration, proliferation, and

186 Cancer Res; 75(1) January 1, 2015

survival of endothelial cells (37). Inadequate blood supply, in
turn, has been shown to cause uneven distribution of anticancer
drugs within tumor and cause drug resistance (38–40). Therefore,
cells in poorly vascularized areas can be protected from exposure
to drugs, resulting in a low overall level of p53 activation. The
antiangiogenic effect of ()-Nutlin-3 was not evident in combination with MLN8237 (Supplementary Fig. S5). This may be due
to antiproliferative activity of MLN8237, which reduces the need
for neoangiogenesis.
We have previously reported that targeting AURKA induces
inﬁltration of immune cells into the tumor (7). Here, we found
that combined MDM2 and AURKA inhibition further promoted tumor inﬁltration by host immune cells (Fig. 4E). Both
lymphoid and myeloid cells accumulated in ()-Nutlin-3 and
MLN8237-treated tumors. The numbers of natural killer (NK)
cells, macrophages, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC)
increased most prominently (Fig. 4F). These changes were
present only at tumor sites and were not seen in either bone
marrow or spleen (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). In fact,
the numbers of DCs and macrophages were decreased in the
spleens of animals treated with the ()-Nutlin-3 and MLN8237
combination, which may be a result of redistribution of these
cell types to the tumor site (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Supplementary Fig. S6C and S6D show the gating strategy for this
experiment.
Aggressively growing B16 tumors usually contain large areas
of necrotic tissue (Fig. 4G). We noted a striking absence of
necrosis in MLN8237 and MLN8237 and ()-Nutlin-3–treated
tumors. Even though the sizes of the MLN8237-treated tumors
varied (Fig. 4B), the absence of necrosis was consistent, suggesting an active clearance mechanism beyond growth inhibition.
To determine the signiﬁcance of tumor-inﬁltrating immune
cells in tumor clearance and overall drug response, we compared efﬁcacy of MDM2 and AURKA inhibition against B16F0
melanoma tumors that were grown either in immunocompetent C57Bl6 mice or in severely immunodeﬁcient NOD/SCID
IL2 receptor gamma chain null (NSG) mice that lack T, B, and
NK cells, have functionally defective macrophages, DCs and
compromised cytokine signaling. Therapeutic efﬁcacy was
greatly reduced in immunocompromised mice as compared
with immunocompetent animals (compare Fig. 4H and Fig.
4A). The induction of the apoptotic marker BIMEL was comparable in immunocompetent and immunodeﬁcient models
(Supplementary Fig. S4C). In contrast, clearance of necrotic
areas in senescent tumors treated with MLN8237 or MLN8237
and ()-Nutlin-3 combination was abrogated in the absence of
functional immune system (Fig. 4I). This suggests that immune
cells recruited into the tumors in response to combined MDM2
and AURKA antagonism facilitate tumor clearance rather than
direct melanoma cell killing. This conclusion is also supported
by the data from the T-cell–deﬁcient mouse model in which the
response to senescence-inducing therapy with the AURKA
inhibitor, as well as to combined AURKA and MDM2 antagonists treatment, was associated with accumulation of phagocytic myeloid cells, such as macrophages and DCs within the
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Senescent cells attract immune cells through induction of
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), characterized

inhibitors. A prominent increase of the Ccl5 chemokine was
detected in response to AURKA inhibitor treatment as well as an
induction of Ccl1 and Cxcl9 in tumors treated with AURKA and
MDM2 antagonists combined (Fig. 5A). Ccl5 attracts monocytes,
macrophages, dendritic, and NK cells; Ccl1 recruits monocytes,
dendritic, and T cells; and Cxcl9 targets T and NK cells (41). These
functional characteristics are consistent with the proﬁles of tumorinﬁltrating leukocytes in MLN8237 and ()-Nutlin-3–treated
cells (Fig. 4F).
To investigate what cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME) were producing these chemokines, we FACS sorted

cells in the tumor based on the surface markers CD45, CD31,

Ccl5 levels were increased in both melanoma cells and ﬁbroblasts
upon MLN8237 or MLN8237 and ()-Nutlin-3 treatments (Fig.
5B). However, because ﬁbroblasts represented a relatively minor
cell population within the TME, melanoma cells were the main
source of Ccl5 in the tumor (Fig. 5E). Similarly, melanoma cells
were the source of Cxcl9 upon AURKA and MDM2 cotargeting,
whereas the tumor-inﬁltrating immune cells produced Ccl1
(Fig. 5C and D).

()-Nutlin-3 and MLN8237 drug combination exhibits good
bioavailability and low toxicity.
For pharmacokinetics analysis, matched plasma and tumor
tissue samples from 56 B16F0 melanoma-bearing C57Bl6 mice
treated with MLN8237 (30 mg/kg) and/or ()-Nutlin-3 (200
mg/kg) were evaluated and modeled together using a population pharmacokinetic approach (Supplementary Table S1). The
population model-predicted plasma and tissue concentration–
time plots for ()-Nutlin-3 (Fig. 6A and 6B) and MLN8237
(Fig. 6C and 6D) indicate adequate model ﬁtting of the
observed data. The hybrid physiologically based pharmacokinetic models for ()-Nutlin-3 and MLN8237 are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S5.
The median ()-Nutlin-3 AUC0–24 h estimate was 292.7 mg/
mL  h for plasma and 455.6 mg/mL  h for tumor tissue. The
overall median (range) MLN8237 area under the concentration–time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0–24 h) estimate
was 42.7 mg/mL  h (14.0–119) for plasma and 37.4 mg/g  h
(4.59–147) for tumor tissue. The median ()-Nutlin-3 plasma
AUC0–24 h decreased 34% (P ¼ 0.0519) in mice that received
()-Nutlin-3 and MLN8237 compared with the ()-Nutlin-3
single-agent arm (Fig. 6E). Likewise, Fig. 6F shows 55% reduction in the median ()-Nutlin-3 tissue AUC0–24 h (P < 0.05) for
mice receiving concomitant MLN8237. The plasma and tumor

exposure were similar comparing mice that received MLN8237
alone or combined with ()-Nutlin-3 (Fig. 6G and 6H). These
results suggest a potential interaction between ()-Nutlin-3
and MLN8237 that reduces ()-Nutlin-3 tumor tissue exposure. The clinical relevance of this interaction remains to be
determined and further studies will be required to optimize the
dosing and scheduling of these drugs as they are integrated into
clinical practice. Nevertheless, the efﬁcacy studies demonstrate
excellent antitumor effect of combined ()-Nutlin-3 and
MLN8237 treatment despite the slight short-term reduction in
tumor tissue levels of ()-Nutlin-3 when combined with
MLN8237.
To assess safety/potential toxicity of this drug combination, we
monitored weight of laboratory animals receiving the therapy
and analyzed the levels of liver toxicity markers ALT and AST
in serum of treated mice. No signiﬁcant weight loss or signs of
liver toxicity were detected (Fig. 6 I–K).

effective than vehicle or single-agent treatment in all experiments
and fully blocked the growth of 4 of 5 tested patient tumors (Fig.
7A). Strong induction of p53, its targets p21, PUMA, and the
mitochondrial apoptosis effector BIMEL was observed in tumor
lysates of ()-Nutlin-3 and MLN8237-treated mice (Fig. 7B).
These data suggest that combined MDM2- and AURKA-targeted
therapy may beneﬁt patients with BRAFWT, as well as with BRAF
inhibitor–resistant tumors.
Collectively, our results demonstrate that combined MDM2
and AURKA antagonism halts melanoma growth by inducing
growth arrest and senescence, limiting lifespan of senescent cells,
and enhancing tumor immune inﬁltration and clearance.

Discussion
We hypothesized that p53-restorative therapy can synergize
with concurrent senescence-promoting therapy. Tumor senescence and immune-mediated tumor clearance has been linked
with response to genetic p53 restoration (21, 43). However, we
found that pharmacologic p53 inducer ()-Nutlin-3 elicited
cytotoxic rather than senescence response in melanoma tumors.
Therefore, we combined ()-Nutlin-3 with the AURKA antagonist
MLN8237, which is capable of triggering melanoma cell senescence in vivo (7). Although senescence induction was found to be
critical for the therapeutic efﬁcacy of this drug, we cannot fully
exclude the possibility that antimelanoma effect of AURKA inhibition extends beyond senescence. A daily oral regimen with the
combination of MDM2 and AURKA inhibitors blocked the
growth of patient-derived p53WT melanoma tumors independent
of BRAF mutational status or resistance to BRAF inhibitor. These
data suggest that p53-restoring mitotic kinase–targeted therapy
could beneﬁt patients with melanoma who are not eligible for
BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Because both p53-activating drugs and
mitotic kinase inhibitors have already been tried on human
subjects, prompt translation of combination therapy to the clinic
is highly feasible.
Although ()-Nutlin-3 alone was a modest inducer of p53 in
vivo, addition of AURKA inhibitor promoted p53 activation in
tumors. This is in agreement with studies showing that AURKA
phosphorylates p53 on serine 315 and 215, which leads to
MDM2-dependent p53 ubiquitination and degradation with
inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity (44, 45). Consistent
with previous ﬁndings in hepatocellular carcinoma and sarcoma
(21, 43), p53 activation failed to initiate classical caspase-driven
apoptosis in melanoma. Nevertheless, we noted a delayed caspase-independent cytotoxic response that may have been previously overlooked. Prolonged p53 activation in melanoma cells
resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial-nuclear translocation of AIF, a known mediator of caspase-independent
cell death (35).
Accumulating evidence suggests that the TME can be an
important positive or negative determinant of tumor response
to therapy. For example, stromal cells have been implicated in
the protection of tumor cells from MEK and BRAF inhibitor–
induced toxicity in melanoma (46). Other studies showed that
treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors restores function to
compromised DC and T cells, thus establishing a tumor-suppressing TME (47, 48). We found that nonmalignant cells in
the TME can modulate the efﬁcacy of p53-restorative therapy.
Senescence induced by AURKA inhibition promoted accumulation of immune cells in melanoma tumors. These ﬁndings are

in agreement with the critical role of immune cells in targeted
elimination of senescent premalignant cells, as well as clearance
of senescent tumor cells (49). As we reported previously,
AURKA inhibition in melanoma cells initiates SASP driven in
part by NF-kB activity (7). Interestingly, activation of p53 in
senescent AURKA-deﬁcient tumors further promoted recruitment of macrophages, DCs, and NK cells by costimulating the
expression of Ccl5, Ccl1, and Cxcl9 chemokines in malignant
and nonmalignant cells of TME. These results are in concert
with a recent ﬁnding that p53 can cooperate with NF-kB in
SASP induction (50). Compromised antitumor activity of
AURKA and MDM2 antagonism in severely immunodeﬁcient
animals indicates that immune-mediated tumor clearance
plays a critical role in response to this therapy.
Our study demonstrates that the potent therapeutic beneﬁt of
MDM2 and AURKA cotargeting is derived from a direct effect on
melanoma cells combined with stimulation of host's antitumor
defenses. Activation of p53 synergized with AURKA antagonism
to inhibit growth and survival of melanoma cells and promote
immune-mediated tumor clearance. These ﬁndings provide a
strong rationale to further develop p53-reactivating therapies in
combination with senescence-inducing drugs, for instance, mitotic kinase inhibitors, for treatment of p53WT metastatic melanoma.
