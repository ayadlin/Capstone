Abstract
Drug resistance is a central challenge of cancer therapy that ultimately leads to treatment failure. In this
study, we characterized a mechanism of drug resistance that arises to AZD6244, an established mitogenactivated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor currently being evaluated
in cancer clinical trials. AZD6244 enhanced the expression of transcription factor FOXO3a, which suppressed
cancer cell proliferation. In AZD6244-resistant cancer cells, we observed the impaired nuclear localization of
FOXO3a, reduced FOXO3a-mediated transcriptional activity, and decreased the expression of FOXO3a target
gene Bim after cell treatment with AZD6244. Resistant cells could be sensitized by phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT inhibitors, which are known to enhance FOXO3a nuclear translocation. Our findings define FOXO3a as candidate marker to predict the clinical efficacy of AZD6244. Furthermore, they suggest a mechanism
of resistance to MEK inhibitors that may arise in the clinic yet can be overcome by cotreatment with PI3K/
AKT inhibitors. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4709–18. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Constitutive activation of certain signal transduction cascades leads to the development of tumors and the resistance of tumors to clinical therapy (1, 2). Approximately
30% of tumors carry an activating mutation in the RAS
oncoprotein (3–5). Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase
kinase 5 is an important effecter in the RAS/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway where activation of
RAS/ERK signaling is known to result in tumor proliferation,
angiogenesis, and metastasis (3, 6). Thus, developing chemical inhibitors targeting the RAS pathway has become an
important cancer therapeutic strategy (3, 6). AZD6244/

ATP-uncompetitive MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 inhibitor,
targets the crucial MEK kinase in the RAS/ERK signaling
pathway (7). A phase I clinical trial of AZD6244 showed
promising results in solid tumors with the best clinical
response in several heavily pretreated cancer patients (8).
AZD6244 phase II clinical trials in various cancers, such
as breast, lung, colorectal, liver, pancreatic cancers, and melanoma are either currently ongoing or recently completed
(from the NIH Web site: http://www.Clinicaltrials.gov).
FOXO3a, a transcription factor in the FOXO family, is a
crucial tumor suppressor. FOXOs are deregulated in several
tumor types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, glioblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia (9, 10). As a
transcription factor, FOXOs activate or repress multiple target genes, such as p27kip1 and cyclin D for cell cycle regulation, and Bim and FasL for inducing apoptosis (11–13). Loss
of FOXO1a through chromosomal deletion (13q14) was shown
to promote androgen-independent prostate cancers (14). In
addition, cytoplasmic localization or downregulation of
FOXOs through AKT, IKK, and ERK-mediated phosphorylation was observed in breast cancers (12, 13). Inhibition of
FOXO3a expression and activity is critical to promote cell
transformation, tumor progression, and angiogenesis (12, 13,
15). Therefore, FOXO family members have been proposed to
be important factors influencing the efficacy of a variety of
chemotherapeutic drugs. For example, the chemotherapeutic
drugs paclitaxel (16, 17) and Akt/protein kinase B signaling
inhibitor-2 (API-2)/Triciribine (AKT inhibitor; ref. 18), which
are clinically used for the treatment of breast carcinoma
and acute myeloid leukemia, can activate FOXO3a by reducing AKT activity.

Based on our previous finding of FOXO3a downregulation by ERK, we were intrigued to ask whether FOXO3a is
an essential target for AZD6244-mediated cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis. Indeed, we found that AZD6244 enhances
G1 growth arrest and cell apoptosis through the downregulation of ERK phosphorylation and stabilization of FOXO3a
in AZD6244-treated cancer cell lines and xenograft tumors
in mice. In addition, knocking down FOXO3a and its downstream apoptotic gene Bim impaired AZD6244-induced
growth suppression, suggesting that FOXO3a and Bim
are essential targets of AZD6244. Furthermore, AZD6244resistant cancer cells showed impaired endogenous FOXO3a
nuclear translocation and reduced Bim activation. LY294002
and API-2, through restoring FOXO3a nuclear translocation
and Bim activation, synergize with AZD6244 in suppressing
proliferation and colony formation in AZD6244-resistant
cells.
Development of cancer cell resistance to cancer therapeutics is a problem of clinical concern; therefore, it is of importance to understand the molecular mechanisms that
contribute to drug resistance and to further identify the molecular targets for novel therapeutics that can overcome
resistance. Previous reports suggested that cancer cells resistant to MEK inhibitors exhibit the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling (19–21). These data are
in concert with our results showing that FOXO3a is inactivated in AZD6244-resistant cells, which likely results from
AKT activation. Our data shows that the combination therapy of AZD6244 with pharmacologic agents that enhance
FOXO3a activity may effectively treat AZD6244-resistant cells
by modulating FOXO3a activation and thereby converting an
AZD6244-resistant cancer into an AZD6244-sensitive one.
Ultimately, our study implicates that FOXO3a activation
may be an essential pharmacologic indicator to predict
AZD6244 efficacy in clinical use.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and plasmids
AZD6244 was provided by AstraZeneca as well as purchased from Selleck Chemicals. API-2 was purchased from
Calbiochem. NVP-BEZ235 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Taxol was ordered from the Bristol-Myers Squibb
Company through our institution. LY294002 was purchased
from Sigma. We generated the green fluorescent protein
(GFP)-FOXO3a construct in our previous study (12). The
pSuper-FOXO3a vector was a gift from Dr. Alex Toker
(Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA).
Cell culture, cell growth, MTT assay, and colony
formation assay
All cell cultures were kept in DMEM/F12 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 5% CO 2 . The cell
growth rate was determined with the MTT assay. Cells (3 ×
103/well) were plated in 96-well culture plates in 0.2 mL of culture medium and allowed to adhere for 2 hours; 20 μL of MTT
were then added to each well. Cells were cultured for an addi-

4710

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

tional 2 hours and 100 μL of lysis buffer [(20% SDS in 50%
N,N-dimethylformamide (pH 4.7)] was added. The cells were
incubated for 4 hours and absorbance at 570 nm was measured. For the soft agar colony formation assay, 2 × 104 cells
were placed in 1.5 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS and 0.3% agarose, and overlaid onto 3 mL DMEM with 10% FBS and 0.6%
agarose in each well of a six-well plate. After 2 weeks, colonies
larger than 20 μm in diameter were counted.
Immunohistochemical staining and immunoblotting
Immunohistochemical staining and immunoblotting were
performed as previously described (13) with the following
antibodies: FOXO3a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERK (Upstate Biotechnology), p-ERK (Cell Signaling), p27, and Bim
(Stressgen).
Real-time PCR
Total RNAs were extracted from cells by using RNeasy kit
(Qiagen). RNAs were reverse transcribed by using SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen). Results were analyzed by the iCycler
(Bio-Rad) real-time PCR and relative quantification of RNA
levels normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as difference of cycling threshold (ΔCT) = CT (target) −
CT (control). Higher CT values indicate relatively lower
expression RNA levels. Bim primer was showed as previously
described (13).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
Chromatin immunoprecipitations were modified from the
EZ-CHIP (Upstate) protocol using antibody FOXO3a (Santa
Cruz).
Cell cycle analysis
Cells were dissociated with trypsin, washed, and resuspended in PBS as a single-cell suspension. Cells were fixed
in 70% ethanol overnight, stained with propidium iodide
(25 μg/mL; Sigma), and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C
with RNase A (20 μg/mL). The DNA content of the cells
was then evaluated by FACSCalibur (BD Immunocytometry
Systems). Linear red fluorescence FL2 was analyzed.
Statistical analysis
All data were presented as means ± the SD of the mean.
Statistical calculations were performed with Microsoft Excel
analysis tools. Differences between individual groups were
analyzed by paired t test. P values of <0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

Results
Activation of FOXO3a by AZD6244 is essential for
AZD6244-induced suppression of cancer cell
proliferation
AZD6244 is known to promote cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis through inhibiting ERK activation and testing in
multiple clinical trials (from the NIH Web site: http://www.
Clinicaltrials.gov). It is therefore critical to understand the
detailed molecular mechanisms and downstream target

genes responsible for its tumor suppression activity. Recently,
inhibition of FOXO3a by ERK showed enhanced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (13). Thus, we sought to determine
whether AZD6244 might suppress tumor growth through re-

storing FOXO3a activity. We found that AZD6244 significantly
suppresses HCT116 colon cancer xenograft tumor growth
in vivo (Fig. 1A) and these AZD6244-treated colon cancer
xenografts showed ∼2-fold increased nuclear FOXO3a

Figure 1. AZD6244 enhanced FOXO3a expression and induced suppression of cancer cell proliferation. A, tumor volume of the HCT116 xenografts
treated with Placebo or AZD6244 was measured for 21 d. The tumor sections of four individual DMSO or AZD6244-treated HCT116 xenografts were
subjected to immunohistochemistry with a FOXO3a antibody. Relative percentages of nuclear FOXO3a expression of individual xenograft tumors from
B were analyzed and the mean values of FOXO3a expression in Placebo or AZD6244-treated group were indicated as bars. B, lysates from various cancer
cell lines: breast cancer (MDA-MB-435), colon cancer (HCT116, SW620, and HT29), and melanoma (WM793) treated with DMSO or AZD6244
(10 μmol/L) for 4 h were subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. C, after transfection with a GFP vector or GFP-FOXO3a, MDA-MB-435
cells were treated with DMSO or AZD6244 (10 μmol/L) for 24 h and subjected to cell cycle analysis. D, MDA-MB-435 cells transfected with control
siRNA or FOXO3a siRNA were treated with AZD6244 (10 μmol/L) for 24 h with or without Taxol and subjected to cell cycle analysis.

expression by immunohistochemistry staining (Fig. 1A). To
further examine the effect of MEK inhibition on FOXO3a
expression in vitro, we tested five different human cancer
cell lines from three cancer types in which AZD6244 is
currently used in phase I/II clinical trials. We found that
AZD6244 significantly inhibits ERK activation and increases FOXO3a expression in all these cancer cell lines
(Fig. 1B), in which cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are concurrently enhanced.
To further validate the effects of AZD6244 on cell cycle and
apoptosis mediated through FOXO3a, we first ectopically expressed FOXO3a and found that AZD6244 enhances G1 cell
cycle arrest (79% versus 71%), which was further increased by
FOXO3a expression (79% increased to 87%; Fig. 1C). In addition to RAS/MEK/ERK, the PI3K/AKT pathway is also known
to inhibit FOXO3a expression and transcriptional activity
(11–13). We tested whether combining AZD6244 with
PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002 could sensitize cancer cells to growth suppression and apoptosis. Indeed,
AZD6244 synergized with LY294002, leading to growth suppression (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In addition, Taxol is the
first-line therapeutic drug for breast cancer patient treatment and has been shown to inhibit AKT, which results in
FOXO3a activation (17). Thus, we also tested the killing effect
with the combination of AZD6244 and Taxol. We found that
AZD6244 also synergized with Taxol in apoptosis induction
(Supplementary Fig. S1) and growth suppression (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In addition, FOXO3a was shown to be required for the AZD/Taxol-induced cell death as measured in
the sub-G1 phase by knocking down FOXO3a (21% reduced
to 11%; Fig. 1D). In addition, the ectopic expression of FOXO3a in FOXO3a −/− murine embryonic fibroblast cell led to a
5-fold increase in apoptosis by AZD6244/Taxol treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Because Bim is a proapoptotic molecule that is turned on by FOXO3a, we examined the roles of
FOXO3a and Bim in AZD6244/LY294002- and AZD6244/Taxolmediated growth suppression and apoptosis by knocking
down FOXO3a and Bim using small interfering RNAs (siRNA;
Supplementary Fig. S4A). Knocking down both FOXO3a and
Bim substantially diminished their growth suppression effects
with either single or combination agents of AZD6244/
LY294002/Taxol (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Together, our data
suggest that enhanced FOXO3a expression is essential for the
sensitization of cancer cells to AZD6244-, AZD6244/Taxol-,
and AZD6244/LY294002-induced growth suppression and
apoptosis.
Impaired FOXO3a expression and activity contributes
to cancer cell resistance in response to AZD6244
treatment
Many human cancer cell lines are resistant to MEK inhibition (7, 22). To further understand resistance to MEK inhibition, we tested whether differential FOXO3a and Bim
expression could contribute to the variable sensitivity
of human cancer cells toward AZD6244 treatment. We
measured the protein expression of FOXO3a and its downstream gene Bim in 19 AZD6244-resistant and AZD6244sensitive cancer cell lines, which have been described in a

4712

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

previous report (7). We found that AZD6244-sensitive cancer
cell lines showed significantly higher FOXO3a and Bim protein levels than the resistant cell lines (FOXO3a P = 0.034
and Bim P = 0.025; Supplementary Fig. S5; Fig. 2A). To further explore whether FOXO3a and Bim expression are modulated by AZD6244, we treated both AZD6244-sensitive and
AZD6244-resistant cells with a range of AZD6244 doses. We
found that AZD6244 treatment effectively decreased p-ERK
levels in AZD6244-sensitive and AZD6244-resistant cells.
However, FOXO3a and Bim expression were readily induced
in AZD6244-sensitive cells with 1, 5, and 10 μmol/L of
AZD6244 (Fig. 2B), in which as AZD6244-resistant cells
showed no significant FOXO3a and Bim induction even with
up to 20 μmol/L (Fig. 2B). Next, we asked whether FOXO3a
transcriptional activity is differently regulated in sensitive
and resistant cell lines in response to AZD6244. We found
that in AZD6244-sensititive cells, AZD6244 treatment induced up to a 4-fold increase in Bim mRNA but not in
AZD6244-resistant cells (Fig. 2C). To further confirm that
Bim induction was mediated through FOXO3a, we performed siRNA knockdown of FOXO3a, which significantly
impaired Bim induction by AZD6244 in the AZD6244sensitive SW620 cells (Fig. 2D). Consistently, enforced expression of wild-type FOXO3a restored the sensitivity of
Bim induction by AZD6244 in the resistant SKBR3 cells
(Fig. 2D). Together, the results suggest that FOXO3a activation is essential to mediate and predict the sensitivity of
cancer cells toward AZD6244 treatment (Please also see
Fig. 4B).
Retarded endogenous FOXO3a nuclear translocation
and reduced FOXO3a-Bim promoter association lead to
impaired sensitivity to AZD6244 treatment
To further understand the molecular mechanism of the
impaired FOXO3a activation in AZD6244-resistant cells in
response to AZD6244, we examined FOXO3a cellular localization under fluoresence microscopy. We found that FOXO3a was primarily localized in the cytoplasm when treated
with AZD6244 in the AZD6244-resistant SKOV3 (Fig. 3A), in
which FOXO3a was not able to associate with the Bim promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 3B,
lane 2) nor was Bim mRNA induced following AZD6244
treatment (Fig. 3B). These results also correspond to previous data and may explain why FOXO3a activity was impaired in AZD6244-resistant cells as shown in Fig. 2B and
C (Bim protein and mRNA expression). Interestingly, FOXO3a nuclear localization in AZD6244-resistant cells was increased under the treatment of LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor;
Supplementary Fig. S6). A similar result was also observed
by treating AZD6244-resistant cells with API-2, an AKT inhibitor currently used in clinical trials (Fig. 3A and B). API-2
also significantly enhanced the binding of FOXO3a to the
Bim promoter in AZD6244-resistant cells (Fig. 3C, lane 3).
Thus, AZD6244 is not able to induce FOXO3a nuclear localization and activate FOXO3a in AZD6244-resistant cells.
However, PI3K/AKT inhibitors can still activate FOXO3a
by increasing its nuclear localization. As expected, in the
AZD6244-sensititive SW620 cells, FOXO3a expression was

relocalization (Fig. 3A), and thus, Bim mRNA induction was
enhanced in both AZD6244-sensitive/resistant cells (Fig. 3C).
These data suggest that FOXO3a failing to translocate to the
nucleus may contribute to impaired Bim activation and

AZD6244 resistance. Pharmacologic agents, such as API-2,
which are able to relocalize FOXO3a to the nucleus and thereby restore FOXO3a activity, could reverse AZD6244 resistance
and promote the efficacy of AZD6244 treatment.

AZD6244 synergizes with API-2, which sensitizes
AZD6244-resistant cells to growth suppression and
apoptosis mediated by FOXO3a
We have shown that AZD6244 synergizes with PI3K/
AKT inhibitors, such as LY294002 or cytotoxic drugs like
Taxol, to suppress cancer cell proliferation (Supplementary
Fig. S2). We further asked if the synergism between
AZD6244 and PI3K/AKT inhibitors could functionally sensitize AZD6244-resistant cancer cells. Consistent with the
previous data showing the re localization of FOXO3a to
the nucleus and enhancement of Bim mRNA expression
by API-2 (Fig. 3C), AZD6244 combined with API-2 led to
significant growth suppression (Fig. 4A) and cell death
(Fig. 4B) in multiple AZD6244-resistant cells (SKOV3,
SKBR3; MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 in Supplementary
Fig. S8). The enhanced killing effects by the combined
treatment of AZD6244 and API-2 were also observed in
AZD6244-sensitive cells (WM793 and SW620; Fig. 4A
and B). Additionally, the sensitization effect of AZD6244
and API-2 in the AZD6244-resistant cells was detected by
colony formation assay (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, knocking
down FOXO3a reversed the suppression of proliferation
(Fig. 4D) by AZD6244/API-2 combination in an AZD6244resistant cell line, indicating that FOXO3a is a key target

for sensitizing AZD6244 treatment. In addition, to test
pharmacologic toxicity compared between cancer and normal cells, a panel of cancer cell lines and normal epithelial
cell lines (two from breast and one from lung) were treated
with the above-mentioned condition simultaneously
(Fig. 5A). Consistent with Fig. 4A and B, AZD6244 combined
with API-2 effectively killed the cancer cells, whereas the
same treatment caused little toxicity in the normal epithelial cells. Together, our findings suggest that combining
AZD6244 with other clinical pharmacologic agents that
enhance FOXO3a activity, such as API-2, can promote the
efficacy of AZD6244 treatment and even sensitize AZD6244resistant cells to growth suppression. Given the results
(Figs. 3 and 4) that the combination of AZD6244 and API-2
increased FOXO3a nuclear translocation, enhanced Bim
promoter association, rescued Bim transcriptional activation,
and sensitized AZD6244-resistant cancer cells to growth
suppression and cell death, we believe that FOXO3a activation is an important factor in reversing AZD6244 resistance.

cells (Fig. 5A) may also benefit AZD6244 treatment by preventing potential side effects in normal cells. A model depicting
molecular responses toward AZD-resistant and AZD-sensitive
cancer cells is proposed in Fig. 5B.

FOXO3a Inactivation and MEK Inhibitor Chemoresistance

Discussion
Until now, AZD6244 has been under evaluation in 21 clinical trials with about 10 different cancer types including
breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, kidney
cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, ovarian
cancer, acute myelogenous leukemia, and thyroid cancer in
which AZD6244 has shown promising therapeutic effects especially in cancers with BRAF mutations with lower toxicity.
Other MEK inhibitors such as PD-0325901 are also shown to
have promising antitumor activity in mouse models but ocular and neurologic toxicity was presented in a phase I clinical
study (from the NIH Web site: http://www.Clinicaltrials.gov).
In Fig. 5A, the combination of AZD6244 and API-2 results in
significant cell death in the five different cancer cell lines but
not in the three different normal cell lines, suggesting that
AZD6244 selectively targets cancer cells and has relatively
low toxicity to normal cells.
AKT and ERK are commonly activated oncogenic kinases
in human cancers. Interestingly, both kinases target the same
tumor suppressor gene, FOXO3a. It was known that AKT and
ERK phosphorylate FOXO3a at different phosphorylation
sites (23). Similarly, the phosphorylation of FOXO3a by these
oncogenic kinases results in FOXO3a translocation from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm and subsequent degradation. Taxol
(17), LY2940024, and API-2 were shown to effectively block
PI3K-AKT pathway and activate FOXO3a nuclear translocation and activity. In our current study, we showed that inhibition of both RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways
enhances FOXO3a activity (Fig. 5B). We showed that the activation of FOXO3a and its downstream gene Bim is particularly important for the maximal sensitivity of cancer cells
responding to AZD6244 treatment.
It has been proposed that the emergence of resistant tumor cells is partly due to the expansion of preexisting resistant cells or acquired resistance; therefore, the challenges
in treating cancer with conventional therapeutics have led
to the development of novel molecular therapeutics aimed
at resolving chemoresistance. Here, we identify a molecular
mechanism for resistance to AZD6244. The AZD6244resistant cancer cell lines are unable to reactivate FOXO3a
in response to AZD6244 treatment and, thereby, have become resistant to AZD6244. We have also shown that further
reactivation of FOXO3a by PI3K/AKT inhibitors can sensitize
AZD6244-resistant cancer cells, suggesting that AZD6244/
API-2 and AZD6244/Taxol combination therapy may overcome AZD6244 resistance to reach maximum therapeutic efficiency. The AZD6244 and Taxol/Docetaxel combination
treatment is currently being assessed in clinical trials.

Recently, an application of combining PI3K and MEK inhibitor for synergistically treating lung cancer was published in
by Engelman and colleagues (24). In this study, using the clinical PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor NVPBEZ235 combined with AZD6244 led to marked synergy in
shrinking murine KRAS-mutant lung tumors, which, however,
did not respond to single-agent NVP-BEZ235. It is known that
KRAS mutation can activate both ERK and AKT (25). Thus, it is
likely that both KRAS-mediated AKT and ERK activation contribute to resistance to NVP-BEZ235 and AZD6244, respectively, in the lung cancer story. To test whether FOXO3a may be a
pivotal regulator for growth suppression in the KRAS mutation lung cancer cells, we investigate nuclear FOXO3a level
by immnuohistochemical staining (Supplementary Fig. S9).
Indeed, nuclear FOXO3a was only partially elevated in each
single-agent treatment. However, AZD6244/BEZ235 combination, which inhibited both AKT and ERK pathways, synergistically enhanced nuclear FOXO3a level (Supplementary Fig. S9).
Together, these data support the notion that similar to API-2,
NVP-BEZ235 could synergize with AZD6244 in suppressing the
growth of AZD6244-resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S10).
Our results suggest that FOXO3a activation might be an
essential marker for predicting the efficacy of MEK inhibitors.
Ultimately, our study provides a timely therapeutic strategy
for AZD6244 application in current cancer treatments, given
that FOXO3a is a potential target for therapeutic intervention
by MEK inhibitors and other therapeutic agents.
