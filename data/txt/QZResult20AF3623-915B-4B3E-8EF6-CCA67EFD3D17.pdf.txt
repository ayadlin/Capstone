ABSTRACT
Tobacco smoke (TS) is a major cause of human bladder cancer (BC).
Two components in TS, 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) and acrolein, which also are
environmental contaminants, can cause bladder tumor in rat models. Their role
in TS related BC has not been forthcoming. To establish the relationship between
acrolein and 4-ABP exposure and BC, we analyzed acrolein-deoxyguanosine (dG)
and 4-ABP-DNA adducts in normal human urothelial mucosa (NHUM) and bladder
tumor tissues (BTT), and measured their mutagenicity in human urothelial cells.
We found that the acrolein-dG levels in NHUM and BTT are 10-30 fold higher than
4-ABP-DNA adduct levels and that the acrolein-dG levels in BTT are 2 fold higher than
in NHUM. Both acrolein-dG and 4-ABP-DNA adducts are mutagenic; however, the
former are 5 fold more mutagenic than the latter. These two types of DNA adducts
induce different mutational signatures and spectra. We found that acrolein inhibits
nucleotide excision and base excision repair and induces repair protein degradation
in urothelial cells. Since acrolein is abundant in TS, inhaled acrolein is excreted into
urine and accumulates in the bladder and because acrolein inhibits DNA repair and
acrolein-dG DNA adducts are mutagenic, we propose that acrolein is a major bladder
carcinogen in TS.

INTRODUCTION

It is well known that the incidence of bladder cancer
in individuals working in the printing, dyeing, and tanning
industries is higher than age- and sex- matched controls
[5, 7]. Ample evidence from both epidemiological studies
and animal models has firmly established that arylamines,
particularly, 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), are the major
culprits in bladder cancer related to occupational exposures
[8, 9]. Moreover, we have found that in cultured human
bladder cells, 4-ABP-DNA adducts are preferentially
formed at p53 mutational hotspots (codons 280 and 285)
in 4-ABP-related bladder cancer [10, 11]. These results

Bladder cancer is the fifth most frequently found
tumor in the United States, with >70,000 incident cases
and resulting in >15,000 deaths annually [1, 2]. Tobacco
smoke is the major cause of bladder cancer in United
States and smokers are approximately 5 times more
likely to get bladder cancer than nonsmokers [3]. Tobacco
smoke contains more than 60 carcinogens, however, which
carcinogens are the major causes for bladder cancer is not
well established [4-6].

establish a molecular link between carcinogen-induced
DNA damage and the p53 mutational patterns in bladder
cancer.
The p53 mutational patterns in tobacco smokerelated bladder cancer and in non-smoking-related bladder
cancer show distinct differences (Supplementary Figure
S1) [12]. While codons 280 and 285 are mutational
hotspots in both smokers and non-smokers, codon 273
is a mutational hotspot in tobacco smoke-related bladder
cancer but not in non-smoking-related bladder cancer [12].
It has been observed that the formation of 4-ABP-DNA
adducts at codon 273 of the p53 gene in urothelial cells
treated with electrophilic 4-ABP metabolites is negligible
[10, 11]. Acrolein, in contrast, binds preferentially at
codon 273 [13, 14]. These results raise the possibility of
agents in tobacco smoke other than 4-ABP may cause
mutations at codon 273 in bladder cancer.
Because of the strong epidemiological and
biochemical evidence, it is generally assumed that 4-ABP
is the major bladder carcinogen in tobacco smoke [8,
9]. This assumption has a couple of inherent problems.
First, the amount of arylamines in tobacco smoke is
minute (1-6 ng/cigarette) [6], and the levels of 4-ABPDNA adducts in bladder tissue of tobacco smokers are
extremely low [15, 16]. Whether or not these low levels
of 4-ABP-DNA adduct are responsible for the majority
of bladder carcinogenesis events is worthy of careful
scrutiny. Second, in addition to arylamines, tobacco
smoke also contains acrolein (150-220 µg/cigarette)
[6], which has been suggested to cause human bladder
cancer [17-20]. Acrolein also has been demonstrated to
cause bladder tumor in rat models in combination with
uracil [18]. Although acrolein bladder carcinogenicity
has not been established humans [21, 22], evidence from
prior investigations has suggested that acrolein is a major
human lung cancer etiological agent in tobacco smoke
[13, 23], thus, we believe an investigation into the role of
acrolein in bladder cancer can potentially lead to a better
understanding of the pathogenesis of tobacco smokerelated bladder cancer, as well as impact risk assessments
and the design of effective prevention measures for
tobacco smoke-related bladder cancer.
The level of acrolein in tobacco smoke is 50,000fold higher than the level of arylamines [6, 15, 24].
Previously, we have found that acrolein inhibits DNA
repair and forms acrolein-deoxyguanosine (acrolein-dG)
DNA adducts that are mutagenic [25, 26]. Acrolein DNA
adducts preferentially form at -CpG- sites, including codon
273 in the p53 gene in human cells, [13, 14]. Since inhaled
acrolein is ultimately excreted into urine and accumulates
in the bladder (14, 15), we hypothesize that acrolein in
the urine causes DNA damage, inhibits DNA repair, and
induces mutations in the urothelial cells, thereby initiating
bladder carcinogenesis.
To begin to test this hypothesis we have analyzed the
levels of acrolein-dG DNA adducts versus 4-ABP-DNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

adducts in normal human urothelial mucosa, as well as in
bladder tumor tissues. We found that the acrolein-dG DNA
adduct levels in normal human urothelial mucosa and
bladder tumor tissues are 10-30 fold higher than the levels
of 4-ABP-DNA adducts, and that acrolein-dG DNA adduct
levels in bladder tumor tissues are significantly higher
than in normal human urothelial mucosa. Furthermore,
we found that while both acrolein-dG DNA adducts and
4-ABP-DNA adducts are mutagenic, the former are more
mutagenic and that the mutational spectra induced by these
two types of DNA adducts are different. We also found that
acrolein inhibits both nucleotide excision repair and base
excision repair and induces repair protein degradation in
human urothelial cells. Based on these results, we propose
that acrolein is a major human bladder carcinogenic agent
in tobacco smoke and that the susceptibility to tobacco
smoke-induced acrolein-dG DNA adduct formation is a
crucial factor for bladder cancer susceptibility.

RESULTS
Acrolein-dG adduct analysis in normal human
urothelial mucosa and bladder tumor tissue
genomic DNA.
Acrolein-dG levels in the genomic DNA of normal
human urothelial mucosa and bladder tumor tissues were
detected by two methods: a 32P-postlabeling method using
a two dimensional-TLC/HPLC and an immunochemical
method using a monoclonal antibody specifically against
acrolein-dG DNA adducts as the first antibody and a
quantum dot-labeled secondary antibody [14]. For the
32
P-postlabeling method, genomic DNA of normal human
urothelial mucosa and bladder tumor tissue was isolated
and digested with phosphodiesterase II and nuclease P1
to single nucleotide levels; the nucleotides, including the
adducted nucleotides, were 5’-end labeled with 32P by T4
kinase and then subjected to two dimensional-TLC and
HPLC separation as previously described [13]. Figures 1
B & 1C shows typical two dimensional-TLC and HPLC
separation results of acrolein-dG DNA adducts from
normal human urothelial mucosa and bladder tumor tissue
samples. The results shows that γ-OH-acrolein-dG is the
major isomer and α-OH-acrolein-dG is the minor isomer in
both normal human urothelial mucosa and bladder tumor
tissue, which is similar to the acrolein-dG DNA adducts
detected in acrolein-treated cultured human cells [25, 38,
39] (Figures 1A & 1C). The levels of acrolein-dG DNA
adducts in a total of 19 normal human urothelial mucosa
(NB-2 to NB-74) and 10 bladder tumor tissue samples
(BT-1 to BT-33) were quantified (Supplementary Table
S1). The levels of acrolein-dG DNA adducts ranged from
4.0 X 10-7 /dG to 48.2 X 10-7 /dG [mean ~ (25±10) x 10-7/
dG] in normal human urothelial mucosa and from 22.4 X

were detected by both 32P-postlabeling and the immunochemical methods. Because of the low amount of sample, 10 BTT samples (BT-54
to BT-75) were detected by immunochemical method only.

10-7 /dG to 110.8 X 10-7 /dG [mean ~ (63±25) x 10-7/dG] in
bladder tumor tissue (Figure 1D and Supplementary Table
S2). The average level of total acrolein-dG DNA adducts
as well as γ-OH-acrolein-dG DNA adducts in bladder
tumor tissue was 2 fold higher than in normal human
urothelial mucosa while α-OH-acrolein-dG DNA adducts
were not significantly different (Figures 1D & 1E).
The levels of acrolein-dG DNA adducts in the
genomic DNA were also assessed immunochemically
using a slot blot method, as previously described [14];
Figure 1F & 1G show typical slot blot results. The relative
amounts of acrolein-dG DNA adducts in normal human
urothelial mucosa (NB-2 and NB-17 to NB-74, n=16)
and bladder tumor tissues (BT-1 to BT-75, n=20) were
quantified based on the fluorescent intensity; the results in
Figure 1H show that the average level of acrolein-dG DNA
adduct in bladder tumor tissue samples was 2 fold higher
than in the normal human urothelial mucosa samples,
consistent with the results from the 32P-postlabeling
method (Figure 1D).

It is well established that 4-ABP-induces three
different adducts: 4-ABP-C8-dG, 4-ABP-N2-dG, and
4-ABP-C8-dA (Figure 2A), which can be distinguished
by differences in DNA digestion properties [32, 33].
4-ABP-N2-dG and 4-ABP-C8-dA, similar to many bulky
DNA adducts, are resistant to nuclease P1 digestion, and
therefore, can be enriched by a nuclease P1 digestion
method similar to that used for acrolein-dG DNA adduct
detection and then separated by three dimensional TLC
[32, 33]. 4-ABP-C8-dG adducts are sensitive to nuclease
P1 digestion [32]; therefore, to analyze 4-ABP-C8-dG
adducts, the nuclease P1 digestion step was omitted
[16, 32]. To detect this type of adduct, genomic DNA
was digested with phosphodiesterase II, the resultant
nucleotides were extracted repeatedly with n-butanol; after
evaporation of n-butanol, the nucleotides were dissolved
in water and labeled with γ-32P ATP. The remaining steps
were similar to those used for detecting 4-ABP-N2-dG

and 4-ABP-C8-dA adducts [16, 40]. These adducts are
separated by different solvent systems; a typical separation
of the three types of 4-ABP-DNA adducts is shown in
Figures 2B & 2C. The levels of 4-ABP-DNA adducts in
the same normal human urothelial mucosa samples (n=19)
and bladder tumor tissues (BT-1 to BT-33, n=10) used
for acrolein-dG DNA adduct analyses were determined
and the results shown in Figure 2D and Supplementary
Table S2. 4-ABP-DNA adduct levels ranged from 0.69
X 10-7 /dG to 2.99 X 10-7 /dG [mean ~ (1.8±0.6) x 10-7/
dG] in normal human urothelial mucosa samples and from
0.92 X 10-7 /dG to 4.14 X 10-7 /dG [mean ~ (2.1±1.1) x
10-7/dG] in bladder tumor tissue samples. Figure 2D

and Supplementary Table S2 demonstrate that neither
the levels of total 4-ABP-DNA adducts nor the levels
of individual 4-ABP-DNA adducts were significantly
different between normal human urothelial mucosa and
bladder tumor tissue.
We then compared the levels of acrolein-dG DNA
adducts and 4-ABP-DNA adducts in the genomic DNA of
normal human urothelial mucosa (NB-2 to NB-74, n=19)
and bladder tumor tissues (BT-1 to BT-33, n=10), and
determined that the levels of acrolein-dG DNA adducts in
normal human urothelial mucosa and bladder tumor tissue
were 10-30 fold higher than the levels of 4-ABP-DNA
adducts (Figures 3A & 3B).

The amounts of tobacco consumption and smoking history of smokers are unknown. Note: acrolein-dG DNA adduct levels are 10-30 fold
higher than 4-ABP-DNA adduct levels in normal human urothelial mucosa and bladder tumor tissues. Acrolein-dG DNA adduct levels are
higher (>2 fold) in bladder tumor tissues than in normal human urothelial mucosa (p<0.001). No significant difference was observed in
4-ABP-DNA adduct levels between normal human urothelial mucosa and bladder tumor tissues (p = 0.32).

adducts in human bladder cells.

and 4-ABP-DNA adducts in bladder cells using a method
previously reported [25]. The results in Table 1A show
that, as a function of concentration, N-OH-4-ABP is less
efficient than acrolein at inducing mutations, not only in
bladder cells but also in normal human lung fibroblasts.
Two possibilities could account for these results: acroleindG DNA adducts are more mutagenic than 4-ABP-DNA
adducts, and/or acrolein is more efficient than N-OH-4ABP at inducing DNA adducts. To differentiate between
these two possibilities, the number of mutations per DNA
adduct induced by these two types of DNA adducts was
calculated and is presented in Figure 4A. The result
shows that acrolein-dG DNA adducts are 5.9-fold more
mutagenic than 4-ABP-DNA adducts (p<0.05). These
results are consistent with the results of Melchior et al. that
show 4-ABP-DNA adducts are the least mutagenic when
compared to other aromatic amines and bulky chemical-

Although the levels of acrolein-dG DNA adducts
in the normal human urothelial mucosa were much
higher than the levels of 4-ABP-DNA adducts, in order
to evaluate their role in bladder carcinogenesis it was
necessary to measure the relative mutagenicity of these
two types of DNA adducts. To achieve this goal, we
reacted supF-containing plasmid DNA with different
concentrations of acrolein and N-OH-4-ABP and
determined the number of acrolein-dG DNA adducts
and 4-ABP-DNA adducts by a UvrABC incision method
(Supplementary Figure S3) [25]. We then determined the
induction of mutations by the acrolein-dG DNA adducts

Figure S3) [25]. Modified plasmids were transfected into UROtsa cells, mutations in the supF gene were detected, quantified, and sequenced
as previously described [25, 31]. (A) Mutation frequency per adduct induced by acrolein-dG DNA adducts and 4-ABP-DNA adducts. (B)

induced DNA damage [41].
To determine whether 4-ABP-DNA adducts and
acrolein-dG DNA adducts generate different types of
mutations or different mutational spectra, the supF
mutants induced by 4-ABP (n=20, from plasmid
incubated with 10 mM N-OH-4-ABP) and acrolein (n=42,
from plasmid incubated with 1 and 2.5 mM acrolein)
in UROtsa cells, were sequenced. The results in Figure
4B and Table 1B show that supF mutations induced by
4-ABP-DNA adducts and acrolein-dG DNA are different
not only in mutational types but also have different
sequence preference in the supF gene. Most notably, there
were two –TTCGAA- mutational hotspots for acrolein
modifications, while with 4-ABP, mutational hotspots
occurred at a -ATCGA- site and within a run of 5 G’s.
The order of mutation frequency induced by ABP-DNA
adducts is G to T, G to C and G to A and 4-ABP-DNA
adducts induce a high frequency of multiple mutations;
these results are similar to those described by Melchoir
et al. [41]. In contrast, acrolein-dG adducts induce a high
frequency of G to C mutations then G to T and G to A;
acrolein also induces a high frequency of large deletion
mutations (Table 1B and Figure 4B).

and MLH1 proteins but has no effect on p53. In contrast,
acrolein treatment does not affect the mRNA levels of
these genes (Fig. 6A & 6B). These results further indicate
that acrolein impairs NER, and BER processes through its
specific effects on repair proteins rather than their gene
transcriptions. It has been long recognized that acrolein
can form Schiff base and carbonylate with amino acid such
as lysine, cysteine, and histidine [26, 42]. It is possible that
acrolein modifications cause protein conformation change
and that these acrolein-modified proteins are subjected
to degradation via proteasome and/or autophagosome
similar to multiple ubiquitinated proteins [43, 44]. To test

Effect of acrolein treatment on DNA repair in
human urothelial cells
Previously we have found that acrolein can not only
damage DNA but also modify repair proteins causing
DNA repair dysfunction in normal human bronchial
epithelial cells (26). To test whether or not acrolein
can cause the same effect in human urothelial cells, we
determined the effect of acrolein treatment on DNA repair
capacity for both bulky DNA damage and oxidative DNA
damage using a host cell reactivation assay and an in vitro
DNA damage dependent repair synthesis assay (13, 26).
Results in Figure 5 show that acrolein treatment causes a
concentration-dependent reduction of DNA repair capacity
for both UV-induced DNA damage and oxidative DNA
damage. Since it is well established that UV-induced DNA
damage is repair mainly by nucleotide excision repair
mechanism and oxidative DNA damage is repair by base
excision repair mechanism (26), these results indicate that
acrolein treatment can inhibit both nucleotide excision
repair and base excision repair.
There are three possible mechanisms via which that
acrolein causes inhibition of DNA repair in urothelial
cells: one, acrolein modifies repair protein causing
protein dysfunction; two, acrolein suppresses expression
of repair genes; and three, acrolein-repair protein
modifications induce protein degradation. To distinguish
these possibilities we determined the effect of acrolein
treatment on repair protein levels as well as expression
of repair genes. We found that acrolein treatment causes a
dose-dependent reduction of XPA, XPC, hOGG1, PMS2,

repair and base excision repair in human urothelial cells.
Immortalized human urothelial (UROtsa) cells were treated with
0, 10, 20, or 50 µM acrolein for 1 h at 37 ºC. The nucleotide
excision and base excision repair capacity in these cells were
determined by (A) an in vitro DNA damage dependent repair
synthesis assay using UV-irradiated or H2O2 modified pUC18
plasmid DNA as substrates, and (B) a host cell reactivation assay
using UV-irradiated or H2O2 modified luciferase plasmid pGL3
as substrates, as previously described (13, 26).

this possibility, cells were pretreated with the proteasome
inhibitor MG132, Lactacystin (Lac) and autophagy
inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Results in Fig. 6C
show that acrolein does not cause a reduction of repair
proteins in cells pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 and Lac, indicating that acrolein-modified
repair proteins are degraded by proteasomes. However,
3-MA can also partially inhibits degradation of XPC,
XPA, Ref-1, MLH1 and PMS2 but not hOGG1. These
results suggest that acrolein-modified repair proteins are
degraded via both proteosome and autophagy pathways
or via proteosome pathway but that 3-MA may be able to
partially inhibit this pathway.

smoke, despite the fact that the amount of arylamines in
tobacco smoke is 50,000 fold less than acrolein [8, 9]. We
recently found that acrolein can function as a co-mutagen,
enhancing DNA damaging agent-induced mutagenesis
while concurrently causing DNA repair dysfunction by
modifying repair proteins [26]. Together, these results
suggest that acrolein is a major bladder cancer etiological
agent in tobacco smoke. In this study, we found that
acrolein-dG DNA adducts were more abundant than
4-ABP-DNA adducts in normal human urothelial mucosa
as well as in bladder tumor tissues and that acrolein-dG
DNA adducts were more mutagenic than 4-ABP-DNA
adducts. We also found that acrolein treatment caused an
inhibitory effect on both nucleotide excision repair and
base excision repair and repair protein degradation in
human urothelial cells. These results serve as a first step in
establishing the role of acrolein in human bladder cancer.
Acrolein is not only abundant in tobacco smoke,
it is also abundant in automobile exhaust and cooking
fumes [23]. In addition, acrolein is a byproduct of lipid
peroxidation in cells under excessive oxidative stress
[26, 47]. Therefore, it is possible that acrolein from both
environmental and endogenous sources can account for
the relatively high levels of acrolein-dG DNA adducts
observed in normal human urothelial mucosa obtained
from nonsmokers. We were unable to determine the effect
of tobacco smoke on acrolein-dG and 4-ABP-DNA adduct
formation in urothelial mucosa due to small sample size
and lack of information on individual’s smoking history

DISCUSSION
Bladder cancer is the most often occurring
secondary cancer in patients who have undergone a prior
extended regimen of cyclophosphamide and ifsofamide
treatment [19, 20, 45]. Since a major metabolite of
cyclophosphamide and ifsofamide in humans is acrolein,
and because acrolein can induce mutagenic acroleindG DNA adducts and can induce bladder tumors in
rat models, acrolein has long been suspected to be a
human bladder carcinogen [18-20]. However, the role
of acrolein in tobacco smoke-related bladder cancer has
not previously been established [18, 21, 46]. Instead,
arylamines, specifically 4-ABP, have been generally
recognized as bladder cancer causing agents in tobacco

products in urothelial cells. UROtsa cells were treated with different concentrations of acrolein for 1 h at 37 oC, the proteins were

separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot (A), and the mRNA levels were detected by RT-PCR (B). In (C) proteosome inhibitor
Lactacystin (10 µM) and MG132 (20 µM) and autophagosome inhibitor 3-methyladenine (10 mM) was added to UROtsa cells before
acrolein treatment and the proteins were detected. Note: 1) Acrolein treatment induces a dose dependent reduction of XPA, XPC, hOGG1,
MLH1 and PMS2 proteins but not p53 and α-tubulin; 2) Proteosome inhibitor Lac and MG132 inhibits the reduction of XPA, XPC,
hOGG1, Ref-1, MLH1 and PMS2 proteins induced by acrolein treatments. Autophagosome inhibitor 3-MA partially inhibits the reduction
of XPA, XPC, Ref-1, MLH1 and PMS2.

and amount of tobacco consumption. However, since
acrolein is readily absorbed by human cells, we propose
that smokers have higher levels of acrolein-dG DNA
adducts in urothelial cells than nonsmokers and that the
susceptibility to acrolein-dG DNA adduct formation
is an important factor in determining bladder cancer
susceptibility [13, 26, 48].
Acrolein is cytotoxic and can efficiently deplete
antioxidants such as glutathione in lung cells [49]. It
has been found that the distribution of acrolein-induced
DNA damage in the p53 gene in normal human bronchial
epithelial cells coincides with the lung cancer p53
mutational spectrum. Therefore, it has been proposed
that acrolein is a major lung cancer causing agent in
tobacco smoke and cooking fumes [13, 23]. The types of
human cancer induced by acrolein appear to be limited to
bladder and lung. Tobacco smoke, in contrast, induces a
wide range of human cancers [6, 48, 50]. In rat models,
intraperitoneal injection of acrolein with non-carcinogenic
uracil specifically causes bladder tumors [18]. Acrolein
can directly react with proteins and DNA to form adducts,
therefore, unlike 4-ABP, the tissue specificity of acrolein
carcinogenicity probably is unlikely due to expression of
phase 1 detoxification enzymes in bladder and lung tissues.
Rather, it is probably due to limitations of bioavailability
because once acrolein is in the blood stream it readily
forms conjugates with proteins and is less active and not
readily be absorbed by human cells. However, protein
conjugated acrolein can be reverted to free acrolein in
the renal system and acrolein is excreted and therefore
accumulates in urine in the bladder (14, 15). This may be
the reason why bladder, aside from lung, which is the first
major target of inhaled acrolein, is the other major target
organ for acrolein-induced carcinogenesis to occur.
In animal models, the oral administration of 4-ABP
induces liver and bladder cancer while subcutaneous
injection can cause mammary and intestine tumors [51].
It has been proposed that arylamines are metabolized
to N-hydroxyamines in the liver and transported to the
bladder as glucuronides, which are converted back to
N-hydroxyarylamides that can be taken up by bladder
epithelial cells that have abundant N-acetyltransferase
1 capable of converting N-hydroxyarylamine to a more
reactive N-acetoxyarylamine [52, 53]. Consequently,
N-acetoxyarylamines react with DNA to form mutagenic
DNA adducts [52, 53]. These findings provide a plausible
explanation of 4-ABP bladder carcinogenicity; however,
the low mutagenicity of 4-ABP-DNA adducts is puzzling.
Arylamine DNA adducts such as 2-aminofluoreneC8-dG DNA adducts have been found to be able to
maintain trans-anti stereo structures that enable adducted
deoxyguanosine to pair with deoxycytosine [54, 55].
Perhaps, 4-ABP-dG and 4-ABP-dA adducts have similar
stereostructures as aminofluorene-C8-dG, therefore, allow
efficient translesion synthesis with high fidelity [56, 57].
While the majority of literatures report that both
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

γ-OH-acrolein-dG and α-OH-acrolein-dG adducts are
mutagenic in mammalian cells [25, 48, 58-61], two reports
found that γ-OH-acrolein-dG adduct is not mutagenic at a
specific sequence and at a very low adduct concentrations
[62, 63]. An in depth review to address the reparability and
mutagenicity of these two types of adducts can be found
in a recent review article [48]. It is worth noting that most
recent results from Llyod’s laboratory has unambiguous
demonstrated that γ-OH-acrolein-dG adduct is mutagenic
[59-61], and recent results from Tang’s laboratory indicate
that the reparability and mutagenicity of these two kinds of
adducts appear to be cell type dependent [48].
We do not yet know why bladder tumor tissues have
higher levels of γ-OH-acrolein-dG DNA adducts than
those in normal human urothelial mucosa. It is possible
that tumor cells are more susceptible to γ-OH-acroleininduced DNA adduct formation and/or tumor cells have
lower repair capacity for this type of DNA adducts. It
should be noted that in vitro acrolein-DNA modifications
generate mainly γ-OH-acrolein-dG adducts under neutral
or slightly alkaline conditions (pH < 8.0), and only
under high pH conditions (pH 10) do α-OH-acroleindG adducts become significant (26, 44). Acrolein is a
byproduct of lipid peroxidation, which can be triggered
by oxidative stress [48]. Perhaps, the higher acrolein levels
in the bladder tumor cells than in normal human urothelial
mucosa are due to higher levels of oxidative stress in
tumor cells, which consequently leads to the formation of
higher levels of acrolein-dG DNA adducts.
In summary, we found that the levels of acroleindG DNA adducts are 10-30 fold higher than the levels of
4-ABP-DNA adducts in both normal human urothelial
mucosa and bladder tumor tissues, that acrolein inhibits
nucleotide excision repair base excision repair, and that
acrolein-dG DNA adducts are much more mutagenic
than 4-ABP-DNA adducts. Since tobacco smoke contains
50,000 fold more acrolein than arylamines, these results
strongly suggest that acrolein may play a more important
role than 4-ABP in tobacco smoke-related bladder
carcinogenesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Uvr proteins were purified as previously described
[27]. Monoclonal antibodies to acrolein-dG DNA adducts
were prepared as described [14]. UPIII antibodies were
purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), α-tubulin
from Calbiochem (Billerica, MA), and antibodies
against mouse/rabbit IgG from Amersham Biosciences
(Pittsburgh, PA). Normal human bladder epithelial cells
(HBEP cells) were obtained from Zen-Bio (Research
Triangle Park, NC). UROtsa cells were obtained from the
3535

laboratory of JR Masters (University College London,
UK) and normal human fibroblasts (CCL202 cells)
were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture
Collection, Manassas, VA). Plasmid pSP189 was prepared
as described by Canella and Seidman [28]. T4 kinase,
protease K, and RNase A were purchased from New
England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA); γ-32P-ATP and α-32PdATP were purchased from Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA),
and nuclease P1 and phosphodiesterase II were purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and Worthington (Lakewood,
NJ), respectively. Acrolein (purity 90%) was purchased
from Sigma and N-hydroxy-4-ABP (N-OH-4-ABP) was
synthesized as previously described (34).

were performed as indicated in previous protocols [26].
Antibodies against human UPIII and α-tubulin were
used as primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidaselabeled antibodies against mouse/rabbit IgG were used as
secondary antibodies. The signals were developed with
an enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham
Biosciences).

Modifications of plasmid DNA with acrolein and
N-OH-4-ABP
Plasmid DNAs (pUC18 and pSP189) were modified
with 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mM acrolein or 0, 1, 5, 10, or
15 mM N-OH-4-ABP at the 37˚C for 16 h. Un-reacted
acrolein and degradation products of N-OH-4-ABP were
removed by repeat phenol/diethyl ether extractions, and
the DNAs were precipitated and washed with ethanol and
dissolved in TE buffer.

Cells and Cell Cultures
Normal human bladder epithelial cells (HBEP
cells) were grown in medium provided by Zen-Bio.
Immortalized normal human bladder cells (UROtsa
cells) were grown in serum-free media containing 1:1
mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium [29]
and Ham’s F-12 supplemented with selenium (5 ng/ml),
hydrocortisone (36 ng/ml), transferrin (5 µg/ml), insulin (5
µg/ml), triiodothyronine (4 pg/ml), and epidermal growth
factor (10 ng/ml). Normal human lung fibroblasts (CCL202 cells) were grown in modified Eagle’s medium [25]
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

SupF mutagenesis assay
Shuttle vector pSP189 plasmids, which contain
a tyrosine suppressor tRNA coding gene supF, were
used as mutational targets [31]. The number of DNA
adducts formed in the plasmid DNA was determined by
UvrABC incision method as previously described [25].
Exponentially growing UROtsa cells or normal human
lung fibroblasts (CCL-202 cells) were transfected with
acrolein- or N-OH-4-ABP-modified pSP189 plasmids
(20 μg) using FuGENE-6 (Roche, Nutley, NJ) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. The plasmids were then
rescued from the human cells by an alkaline lysis method
72 h after transfection [31]. Mutations were identified, and
mutation frequency calculations and mutated sequence
identifications in the supF gene were conducted as
described previously [25].

Genomic DNA Isolation
Genomic DNA was isolated as previously described
[30]. In brief, cells were washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl,
10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH7.5) and lysed
with lysis buffer (0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 mM
Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl, 100 μg/mL
proteinase K) at room temperature for 4 h. Protein was
removed by repeated phenol/diethyl ether extractions, and
the DNA was precipitated with sodium acetate (0.3 M,
pH 7.0) and 75% ethanol, and resuspended in TE buffer
(10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA). RNA was removed
by treatment with RNase A (50 μg/mL) at 37°C for 2 h,
followed by repeated phenol/diethyl ether extractions,
and the DNA was precipitated by ethanol–sodium acetate
and resuspended in TE buffer. The purity of DNA was
assessed by gel electrophoresis and UV absorption spectral
analysis.

Effect of acrolein treatment on DNA repair
capacity
The effect of acrolein treatment on DNA repair
capacity was assessed by an in vitro DNA damage
dependent repair synthesis assay and a host cell
reactivation assay as previously described (13, 26).
UROtsa cells were treated with 0, 10, 20 and 50 µM
acrolein for 1 h at 37 ºC. Cell lysates were prepared
immediately after acrolein treatment and frozen at -80
ºC. The cell lysates were used to carry out DNA damage
dependent repair synthesis assay as previously described
(13, 26). In brief, UV-irradiated pUC18 plasmids
were as substrates for nucleotide excision repair, H2O2
modified pUC18 as substrates for base excision repair,
and unmodified pBR322 as the control; DNA damage
dependent repair synthesis was conducted in the presence

UPIII detection
Cell lysates from cultured bladder cells and human
bladder tissues were prepared as previously described
[13]. The protein levels were determined by the Bradford

of α-32P-dATP. The amount of 32P incorporation in
the synthesized DNA after subtraction of control and
normalization with the amount of input DNA represents
the repair capacity (13, 26). For the host cell reactivation
assay, UROtsa cells with and without acrolein treatment
were transfected with UV-irradiated or H2O2-modified
luciferase plasmid pGL3 and unmodified pSV-βgalactosidase plasmid; after 24 h incubations the luciferase
and β-galactosidase activity in these cells were measured
as previously described (13, 26). The relative luciferase
after normalized with β-galactosidase represents the
relative repair capacity.

Bladder tumors of various grades were diagnosed
based on tumor morphology and corroborated using
results from histological light microscopic examination
(Supplementary Table S1). Following surgical resection,
tissue samples were immediately frozen at -80 ºC. To
ensure that the normal human urothelium mucosal samples
had the characteristics of urothelial cells, we assessed the
expression of uroplakin IIIa (UPIIIa) [35, 36]. The results
in Supplementary Figure S2 show that UPIIIa (molecular
weight 47 kDa) is highly expressed in normal urothelial
tissue samples and that the expression of UPIIIa is
significantly reduced in bladder tumor tissue. A positive
reaction for UPIIIa has been reported in transitional cell
carcinomas; however, none of a large series of carcinomas
derived from other organs that comprised 106 primary
and 71 metastatic carcinomas was found to be positive for
UPIIIa [37].
The study was approved by the New York University
IRB. All patients provided informed consent in their native
language to participate in the study.

Acrolein- and 4-ABP-DNA adduct determinations
Acrolein-dG DNA adduct levels in the genome were
detected by a two dimensional thin layer chromatography
(TLC)/HPLC method, as well as by an immunochemical
method as previously described [14, 26]. Because 4-ABPC8-dG DNA adducts are sensitive to nuclease P1 digestion,
these adducts were detected directly in n-butanol extracts
without nuclease P1 treatment by a three dimensional
TLC method [16, 32]. 4-ABP-C8-dA and 4-ABP-N2-dG
DNA adducts were detected by nuclease P1 digestion
and a three dimensional TLC method [33]. Using dGMP
for a 32P labeling standard, we determined that the 32P
postlabeling two dimensional TLC/HPLC method detected
5% of acrolein-dG adducts that were detected by LC-MS/
MS (25) and that 32P postlabeling three dimensional TLC
method detected 4.3% of 4-ABP-DNA adducts that were
detected by LC-MS/MS [34]. The final levels of acroleindG and 4-ABP-DNA adducts were normalized based on
these results.
