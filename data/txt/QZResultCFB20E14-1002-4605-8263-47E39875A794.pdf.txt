BACKGROUND: Numeracy and Adjuvant! are 2 web-based calculators that are used widely to estimate the prognosis
and potential benefit of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)–based therapy for patients with stage II and III colon cancer. In
this study, the authors compared the predicted survival estimates from these models with the actual observed estimates in independent datasets that were derived from a population cohort and from clinical trials. METHODS: The
population cohort was derived from the British Columbia Colorectal Cancer Outcomes Unit database, which identified
referred patients with stage II and III colon cancer from 1995 to 1996 and from 1999 to 2003. Patients who were enrolled in North Central Cancer Trials Group (NCCTG) trials NCCTG 94651 and NCCTG 914653 were included in the trials dataset. Patient and disease data were used to predict 5-year relapse-free and overall survival using both tools.
RESULTS: In the population-based dataset (N ¼ 2033), Adjuvant! offered more reliable predictions of prognosis for
patients who underwent surgery alone, but it had reliability similar to that of Numeracy for predicting the prognosis
for patients who received adjuvant 5-FU. Both models tended to overestimate survival for patients with stage II disease who received 5-FU. In the trials dataset of patients who underwent and received 5-FU (N ¼ 1729), Numeracy
and Adjuvant! demonstrated similar performance and improved correctness. CONCLUSIONS: This independent validation analysis demonstrated that both Numeracy and Adjuvant! had similar predictive performance and acceptable
reliability for patients with stage III disease. Survival outcomes of patients with stage II colon cancer who received

In 2009, an estimated 130,000 new cases of colon cancer were diagnosed in the United States and Canada, representing

the third leading cause of cancer-related incidence and mortality in men and women.1,2 The use of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU)--based chemotherapy for stage III and high-risk stage II colon cancer represents the most noteworthy advance for
improving survival in the modern-day chemotherapeutic management of colon cancer. The benefit of adjuvant therapy
has been established through several well conducted, multinational, randomized controlled trials of 5-FU--based chemotherapy that demonstrated a 35% reduction in the risk of death for patients with lymph node-positive disease.3 More
recently, a benefit from the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-FU--based chemotherapy has been demonstrated, establishing 5FU combined with folinic acid and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX or FLOX) as the current standard of adjuvant care for stage III
colon cancer.4,5
Although the disease-free and overall survival (OS) benefits have been well enumerated in clinical trials, predicting
the prognosis for individual patients and the expected absolute benefit of adjuvant therapy for an individual patient can be
complex. Multiple factors are relevant, including disease-specific factors, efficacy of the treatment intervention, and competing risks of morbidity and mortality. To aid in individualizing decisions regarding adjuvant therapy, prognostic

decision calculators have been developed with the intent
of providing clinicians with a tailored estimate of a
patient’s baseline prognosis and predicted treatment benefit for stage II and III colon cancer. Currently, 2 such
web-based programs are available for on-line use: 1)
Numeracy (available at www.mayoclinic.com/calcs
accessed February 10, 2011), a model that was developed
at the Mayo Clinic derived from a pooled individual
patient-data meta-analysis of 7 randomized clinical trials,
including 3341 trial participants3; and 2) Adjuvant!
(available at www.adjuvantonline.com accessed February
10, 2011), a model that was developed using prognosis
estimates derived from US Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) tumor registry-reported outcomes for patients with colon cancer in the general population and estimates of adjuvant therapy efficacy derived
from proportional risk reductions published in the
literature.
Although both tools are used widely by health professionals to assist in providing estimates of benefit from
adjuvant 5-FU–based therapy, to date, the validity of the
assumptions inherent in the projections provided by these
on-line prognostic tools have not been validated independently. In this study, we examined the accuracy and
validity of Numeracy and Adjuvant! by comparing the
predicted recurrence-free survival (RFS) and OS estimates
with the observed outcomes from 2 independent data
sources: a population-based dataset of patients who were
referred to a Canadian provincial cancer agency and a
clinical trial dataset that included patients who were enrolled in 2 adjuvant therapy trials, North Central Cancer
Treatment Group (NCCTG) 894651 and NCCTG
914653.6,7

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Population-Based Dataset Validation
Patients with resected stage II and III colon cancer who
were referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency
(BCCA) from 1995 to 1996 and from 1999 to 2003 were
identified from the Colorectal Cancer Outcomes Unit
(CRCOU) database. The BCCA provides a populationbased cancer control program for residents of the province
of British Columbia, Canada, and consists of regional
cancer centers in partnership with an extensive community oncology network. For these periods, >60% of British Columbian patients with resected colon cancer were
referred to the BCCA, and nonreferred patients represented either those who were deemed unsuitable for an ad-

4156

juvant therapy referral on the basis of age, comorbidities,
or indication, or those who were managed primarily in
the community oncology network. In accordance with the
BCCA systemic therapy guidelines during the study period, adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended for
patients with stage III disease but was not recommended
routinely for stage II disease. The endorsed chemotherapy
regimen at that time was the Mayo Clinic monthly regimen of bolus 5-FU and low-dose leucovorin.
Data collected from the CRCOU database included
patient demographics (age, sex, year of diagnosis), disease
status (histologic grade of well, moderately, or poorly differentiated; tumor depth of invasion; number of positive
lymph nodes; and number of examined lymph nodes), and
treatment received (surgery alone or surgery plus 5-FU
chemotherapy). Observed patient outcomes were recorded
as measured from the date of diagnosis to the first observed
relapse and the date and cause of death, if applicable.
Clinical Trials Dataset Validation
NCCTG 894651 was a trial of 915 patients with stage II
or III colon cancer who were assigned on a double-random basis to receive standard 5-FU and levamisole versus
5-FU plus leucovorin and levamisole and also to received
12 months versus 6 months of chemotherapy.6 No difference in survival was demonstrated between chemotherapy
assignment or 6 months versus 12 months of chemotherapy. NCCTG 914653 was a trial of 878 patients with
stage II or III colon cancer who were assigned randomly to
receive standard-dose levamisole combined with 5-FU
plus leucovorin versus high-dose levamisole combined
with the same chemotherapy.7 No difference in survival
was demonstrated with high-dose levamisole. Individual
patient data from both trials were pooled for this analysis.
It is important to note that these NCCTG trials were not
included in the pooled analysis for development of the
Numeracy tool3 and represent an independent trials dataset. Data collected from the trials database included
patient demographics (age, sex) and disease status (histologic low-grade [classified as well or moderately differentiated] or high-grade [classified as poorly differentiated or
anaplastic], tumor depth of invasion, and the number of
positive lymph nodes). Because the trials database did not
include a variable for the number of examined lymph
nodes, this variable was derived using an algorithm assignment of 4 to 10 examined lymph nodes if the number of
positive lymph nodes was 3 and >10 examined lymph
nodes if the number of positive lymph nodes was >3.
Observed patient outcomes were measured from date on

study to date of first recurrence and date of death when
applicable.
Analysis
The observed RFS was measured from the date of diagnosis for the population-based dataset and from the date on
study for the clinical trials-based dataset, to the date of recurrence or death if there was no recurrence. The observed
OS was measured from the date of diagnosis or the date
on study to the date of death. Predicted RFS and OS estimates were derived for each patient in both validation
datasets using the Numeracy (version 2003) and Adjuvant!Online (version 2005) calculators. The input options for
Numeracy include the number of lymph nodes (none, 14, or 5; lymph nodes), tumor classification (T1/T2, T3,
or T4), grade (low or high), and age (49 years, 50-59
years, 60-69 years, or 70 years). The Adjuvant! tool has
3 additional inputs for sex (man or woman), the number
of examined lymph nodes (0, 1-3, 4-10, or >10 lymph
nodes), and comorbidity (perfect health, minor problems,
average for age, or major problems). Because comorbidity
measures were not available for either dataset, a default
comorbidity assumption of ‘‘Minor Problems’’ was
applied. A sensitivity analysis with ‘‘average for age’’
comorbidity also was performed. In addition, the lymph
node and grade categories for the 2 tools differed slightly.
Hence, in the current analysis, the ‘‘1 to 3’’ and ‘‘4’’ positive lymph node categories in Adjuvant! were considered
interchangeable with the ‘‘1 to 4’’ and ‘‘5’’ positive
lymph node categories, respectively, in Numeracy. Likewise, the grade 1 and 2 categories in Adjuvant! were considered interchangeable with the low-grade category in
Numeracy.
The observed 5-year RFS and OS were compared
using the method of Kaplan-Meier (KM) with predicted
estimates from Numeracy and Adjuvant! in a univariate
analysis of relevant prognostic factors and according to
combined groupings of tumor (T)-classification, lymph
node (N) status, and grade. Groups with <10 observations were removed. The comparative analyses are presented in a descriptive manner using the absolute
difference in percentiles between observed and predicted
5-year outcomes by univariate analysis, the percentage
closer rate across combined prognostic subgroups by multivariate analysis, and the percentage correct predictions
of 5-year status for each model. Correctness was deemed
accurate if a patient was alive and predicted to be alive
with probability 50%, or dead with a predicted probability of being alive <50%. For RFS and OS, the Adju-

vant! and Numeracy predictions were divided into 5%
intervals. Intervals were grouped so that each interval contained at least 50 observations. The observed KM estimations for each interval subset were plotted against the
average prediction for both tools.

RESULTS
Population-Based Dataset
In total, 2033 patients were included in the BCCA cohort
and had a median follow-up of 5.6 years. Nine hundred
twenty-four patients (45%) underwent surgery alone, and
1109 patients (55%) were underwent surgery and also
received 5-FU chemotherapy. Table 1 summarizes the demographic and staging characteristics of this cohort overall and according to treatment status and reveals that the
patients who received 5-FU were younger and more commonly had lymph node-positive disease.
Table 2 presents the overall and subgroup univariate
mean predictions for Numeracy and Adjuvant!, and the
observed KM rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
for 5-year RFS and OS. For surgery alone, the 5-year OS
and RFS estimates from Numeracy and Adjuvant! differed
from the mean observed rate by 6% and 3% for Numeracy, respectively, and by 3% and 2%, respectively, for Adjuvant!. For the lymph node-negative, stage II subgroup
(n ¼ 621), the Numeracy and Adjuvant! estimates for OS
differed from the observed rate by 4% and 2%, respectively, and the estimates for RFS differed by 2% and 2%,
respectively. Across all 14 subgroups by age, sex, grade, Tclassification, and lymph node status, the Adjuvant! estimates more commonly were within the observed 95% CI
for OS (14 of 11 subgroups vs 9 of 14 subgroups) and
RFS (13 of 14 subgroups vs 10 of 14 subgroups) compared with the Numeracy estimates. The differences
between the predicted and observed estimates were within
5% more frequently for Adjuvant! (12 of 14 subgroups
for OS, 13 of 14 subgroups for RFS) versus Numeracy (8
of 14 subgroups for OS, 9 of 14 subgroups for RFS). In
untreated patients, both calculators systematically underestimated the risk of recurrence/death compared with the
observed rates for young patients (aged <50 years) and
overestimated the risk of recurrence/death for older
patients and patients who had 4 to 10 positive lymph
nodes.
In Table 2, for surgery plus 5-FU, the difference
between estimates in the overall group by Numeracy and
Adjuvant! from the observed 5-year OS rates were 2%
with both calculators and 4% and 6%, respectively, for 5-

year RFS. In the pooled treated group, the predicted estimates from both calculators were beyond the upper limit
of the 95% CI for the observed RFS estimate. For patients
who were treated for stage II disease (n ¼ 193), the predictions for OS and RFS were more notably overestimated
versus the observed rates, differing by 7% for OS and 6%
for RFS with Numeracy versus 8% for OS and 11% for
RFS for Adjuvant!. Among the 15 subgroups by age, sex,
grade, T-classification, and lymph node status, the Adjuvant! estimates were within the observed 95% CI for OS
with the same frequency as Numeracy (12 of 15 subgroups); whereas, for RFS, Numeracy estimates were
more commonly within the observed 95% CI compared
with Adjuvant! (11 of 15 subgroups vs 8 of 15 subgroups).
The frequency of a difference between the predicted and
observed estimate that was within 5% was comparable

(Adjuvant!: 12 of 15 subgroups for OS and 8 of 15 subgroups RFS; Numeracy: 11 of 15 subgroups for OS and 8

The percentages of predictions that were closer to
the observed data across prognostic groups by multivariate analysis are presented in Table 3 and were notably
higher with Numeracy for RFS in the surgery plus 5FU cohort versus higher rates with Adjuvant! for OS in
the surgery-alone cohort. Table 3 also illustrates the percentage correct rates for RFS and OS, which were similar for both prognostic models within both cohorts. The
5-year Numeracy and Adjuvant! average predicted estimates for OS and RFS divided into 5% intervals are
illustrated in Figure 1 (top and middle rows) against the
observed KM estimates for surgery alone and surgery
plus 5-FU.

Clinical Trials-Based Dataset
In total, 1729 patients who were eligible for this analysis
and were enrolled in NCCTG 894651 (n ¼ 887) and
NCCTG 914653 (n ¼ 842) were included and had a median follow-up of 8.2 years. Table 1 presents the characteristics for this pooled cohort, revealing a similar
distribution of characteristics for both studies. All patients
received surgery plus 5-FU chemotherapy, and 21% were
lymph node-negative. In Table 4, the overall OS and RFS
predictions differed from the observed rates by 2% and
1%, respectively, for Numeracy, versus 0% and 4%,
respectively, for Adjuvant!. The pooled RFS estimate for
Adjuvant! was beyond the 95% CI. For patients who had
lymph node-negative disease (n ¼ 363), the predicted
estimates differed from observed OS and RFS by 5%
and 5%, respectively, for Numeracy versus 4% and
1%, respectively, for Adjuvant!. Among the 15 subgroups defined by age, sex, grade, T-classification, and
lymph node status, the Numeracy estimates less commonly were within the observed 95% CI for OS compared with the Adjuvant! estimates (11 of 15 subgroups vs
13 of 15 subgroups) but more commonly were within the
95% CI for RFS (15 of 15 subgroups vs 10 of 15 subgroups). Both calculators overestimated prognosis in
patients who had >10 positive lymph nodes, although the
sample size in this group was small (n ¼ 18). The absolute
differences between mean predicted and observed estimates were comparably within 5% for Numeracy (11 of
15 subgroups for OS and 12 of 15 subgroups for RFS)
versus Adjuvant! (11 of 15 subgroups for OS and 11 of 15
subgroups for RFS).

with Adjuvant! for RFS and OS. The percentages of correct predictions were very similar for both prognostic
models. Figure 1 (bottom row) illustrates the 5-year
Numeracy and Adjuvant! average predicted estimates for
OS divided into 5% intervals compared with the observed
KM estimates.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we evaluated the performance of 2
commonly used, web-based prognostic models for the adjuvant treatment of stage II and III colon cancer: Mayo
Clinic’s ‘‘Numeracy’’ and ‘‘Adjuvant!.’’ We used descriptive analyses of the predicted estimates of prognosis and
benefit from adjuvant 5-FU treatment against observed
estimates from 2 independent datasets: a populationbased experience of 2033 patients who were referred to
the BCCA and a pooled set of 1729 patients who were enrolled on 2 NCCTG adjuvant 5-FU trials. A recent comparative analysis based on hypothetical patient scenarios
using all possible combinations of comparable data
yielded similar outputs for Numeracy and Adjuvant! in
predicting the absolute benefit of 5-FU chemotherapy
over surgery alone, although some differences were noted,
particularly in estimates of baseline prognosis for
untreated patients.8 Although the Adjuvant! tool has been
validated previously for use in breast cancer,9 to our
knowledge, neither tool has been validated for use in the
adjuvant colon cancer setting. Using a number of descriptive comparative metrics, the current analysis has demonstrated that, although both Numeracy and Adjuvant!
exhibit overall acceptable and similar reliability, some important areas of disagreement are present.

a
Cell level analysis with >10 observations.
b
Correct if the predicted probability of an event was 0.5 and the patient was alive with no recurrence (RFS) or was alive (OS) at 5 years or if the predicted
probability of an event of recurrence or death (RFS) or death (OS) was <0.5 and the patient was dead at 5 years.

For baseline prognosis estimates for surgery alone
using the population cohort, Adjuvant! offered more reliable predictions than Numeracy. This was not entirely
unexpected, because Adjuvant! derives its estimates from
the US SEER registry and US mortality data, which are
population-based. The estimates for patients who received
5-FU were similar in the population and trials datasets
according to the measures of comparison that were used
in this analysis. With respect to the robustness of these
tools, both models had acceptable performance for the
population and trials validation of treated patients despite
the comparatively younger age of the trials cohort.
More of a difference was noted for patients with
stage II disease. Compared with the population-based
dataset, both Numeracy and Adjuvant! frequently overestimated RFS and OS. This may reflect the reality that
patients who were treated for stage II disease in the population cohort were likely to have other features suggestive
of high-risk disease that would have compelled treatment
and, consequently, were associated with inferior 5-year
observed outcomes. Evaluating the models in terms of the
difference between observed and predicted estimates,
both Numeracy and Adjuvant! demonstrated better performance in the trials dataset with closer, albeit slight,
underestimations in predicting RFS and OS in treated
patients. This may be explained in part by the use in both
models of estimates of 5-FU treatment efficacy from trials-derived, proportional reductions in the risk of recurrence and death. Nonetheless, as these tools are clinically
applied in the real-world, the tendency for modestly overoptimistic estimates of treatment benefit for stage II disease should be considered.
At the individual patient level, both tools do leave
room for improvement. Each tool in each patient accurately predicted outcome at the patient level (judged as
correct if the patient’s predicted probability of 5-year survival was >50% and the patient was alive and similar for

4164

the probability of death) just 66% of the time. Additional
markers of prognosis and treatment benefit in the adjuvant setting are required. Although, to date, they not routine, molecular prognosticators of interest, such as
microsatellite instability and, more recently, multigene
expression profiles for assessing the risk of recurrence,
hold the potential to influence adjuvant decision making.10,11 It would be of future interest to evaluate the realworld impact of these biomarkers compared with or in
conjunction with the Numeracy and Adjuvant! clinical
prediction tools.
A major strength of this study is that it employs the
use of individual patient data from 2 independent sources,
which were not used to derive the prognostic models for
Numeracy or Adjuvant!. The primary limitation of this
analysis is that it validates the predictive performance of
these models for 5-FU therapy, whereas the current standard for patients with stage III disease is FOLFOX. Both the
Numeracy and Adjuvant! programs currently offer survival
estimates for FOLFOX treatment based on application of
the proportional benefits observed in the Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin
in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer (MOSAIC)
trial and National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) C-06.4,5 Although certain observations with
respect to predicting baseline prognosis and the risk of
overestimating treatment benefit may be inferred, a subsequent validation for FOLFOX also is desirable.
Therefore, if the treatment benefit estimates are
comparable, then is a single prognostic model preferred?
Both tools are web-accessible and available free of charge.
Numeracy at www.mayoclinic.com/calcs does not require
registration or login and only involves 4 data inputs of
age, T-classification, lymph node (N) status, and grade.
Adjuvant! at www.adjuvantonline.com requires registration and login and involves additional data points for
input, including comorbidity, sex, and the number of

examined lymph nodes. Its interface is more user-friendly
than Numeracy and includes presentation graphics and
illustrations that may be useful when discussing adjuvant
therapy with patients.12 Therefore, the choice of a decision aid will be driven by individual preferences and user
familiarity.
The decision to offer adjuvant chemotherapy needs
to be tailored to include an assessment of treatmentrelated risks and benefits for the individual patient. Prognostic estimates provided by clinicians tend to be divergent and inconsistent.13 The availability of easily
accessible and more reliable predictions of outcomes, with
or without chemotherapy, provides patients with better
prognostic and predictive information and facilitates decision-making for the physician, patient, and family.
Although neither tool is 100% accurate, this independent
validation analysis demonstrates that both Numeracy and
Adjuvant! provide similar predictive reliability, which, in
concert with clinical judgment and patient discussion, are
worthwhile decision aids for 5-FU–based adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II and III colon cancer.
