BACKGROUND. Single-institutional studies lack sufficient power to assess the role
of surgery and radiotherapy in the management of sarcomas involving the anterior skull base. For this study, an international collaborative study group analyzed
a large cohort of patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of skull base
tumors.

METHODS. A subset of 146 patients who had a histologic diagnosis of skull base
sarcoma (SBS) formed the basis of this report. Most patients were aged 21 years
(77%) and had stage IV disease (56%). Adjuvant radiotherapy was received by
35% of patients, and chemotherapy was received by 10% of patients.

RESULTS. Orbital involvement was encountered in 53% of patients, involvement
of the orbital wall was encountered in 46% of patients, and intracranial extension
was encountered in 28% of patients. Positive microscopic margins were reported
in 43% of patients (51 of 118 patients). Treatment-related complications were
reported in 27% of patients, and postoperative mortality was reported in 1.4% of
patients. With a median follow-up of 34 months, the 5-year overall, disease-

Tumor grade and adjuvant radiotherapy were not significant predictors of surtive complications were significant predictors of reduced disease-specific survival
on univariate analysis. The presence of positive/close margins, however, was the
only independent predictor of poor overall, recurrence-free, and disease-specific
survival on multivariate analysis (relative risk, 2.4; P 5 .006). The 5-year diseasespecific survival rate was 77%, 43%, and 36% for patients with negative, close,
and positive margins, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that wide craniofacial resection with
negative margins is an independent prognostic predictor of better outcome.

STS are found infrequently in the mature population,
in which they account for 10% of all sarcomas1–3 and
only 1% of head and neck tumors.4 These tumors are
more common in childhood, and up to 33% occur in
the head and neck region.5,6 The skull base is one of the
common anatomic regions involved in head and neck
sarcomas.7,8 The majority of these patients present
with symptoms, the most frequent of which is a painless mass.4 Other common symptoms are epistaxis,
nasal obstruction, pain, and cranial nerve deficits.9
Among all patients with sarcoma, those who
have tumors originate in the skull base region have
the lowest overall survival (OS) rates.10 The limited
number of studies on skull base sarcomas (SBS) have
reported an 5-year OS rate of 75% and a progressionfree survival rate at 5 years of 60%.11 Most series
indicated that approximately 50% of patients who
fail will have done so within 2 or 3 years after the
completion of treatment.12,13 Unlike sarcomas in
other anatomic sites, in which distant metastases are
the most common cause of death, the great majority
of patients with SBS will succumb to local recurrence
at the skull base that involves vital structures, such
as the carotid arteries, cavernous sinus, and brain.
The primary treatment modality for most patients
with SBS remains wide surgical resection. A major determinant of outcome for these patients is the adequacy of surgical resection of the primary tumor. This
concept, along with the development of new surgical
and reconstructive techniques, has led to the development of a variety of radical surgical approaches for
malignant tumors originating in the anterior skull
base.14 An evolution in the therapy has resulted in the
use of postoperative adjuvant radiation, which may
improve local control and disease-free survival for
patients with high-grade tumors.15 Adequate surgical
resection has remained a cornerstone to the successful treatment of patients with SBS.16
Although head and neck sarcomas have been
described well in the surgical and oncologic literature, there is a lack of clinical data on sarcomas
involving the anterior skull base. The clinical behavior, staging, treatment, and outcomes have been
characterized poorly for patients with SBS. A significant contributor to the debate regarding this disease
originates from the difficulty in diagnosis of skull
base soft tissue tumors based on conventional pathologic and cytologic measures. A major factor in the
behavior of SBS is that soft tissue sarcomas belong to
a spectrum of diseases with high and low grade.
Overall, a significant debate remains whether combined-modality treatment, including surgical resection and radiation therapy, provides the best results
in terms of disease control and survival.

Craniofacial resection (CFR) is a well-established
technique for the surgical excision of tumors involving the anterior skull base and paranasal
sinuses.17,18 This technique requires a frontal craniotomy along with a transfacial approach to allow broad
exposure of the anterior cranial fossa and subcranial
compartment. The use of CFR and other surgical
approaches to the anterior skull base (ie, the subcranial approach) has been documented for a variety of
malignant and benign tumors.19,20 However, because
of the rarity of these neoplasms, little is known about
the surgical results and clinical outcomes of patients
undergoing CFR specifically for SBS. All of the
reports on anterior SBS are based on cohorts of
patients with head and neck sarcoma who received
varying treatment regimens; therefore, identification
of independent prognostic predictors using multivariate analysis has not been possible. To address this
dilemma, data from an international collaborative
study with clinical information on >1300 patients
who underwent CFR were used, and a subset of
patients with SBS was analyzed. The objective of this
study was to assess the efficacy of surgical treatment
and adjuvant therapy, in a multi-institutional cohort
and to identify independent predictors of outcome
after treatment using multivariate analysis. To our
knowledge, this is the only study published to date
on sarcomas isolated to the anterior skull base.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A multi-item questionnaire was sent to 17 participating investigators from various parts of the world to
obtain information on patient, tumor, and treatment
variables and on outcomes of treatment. Completed
data sheets on patients who were treated between
October 1956 and January 2000 were submitted by
each investigator to the central analyzing office for
data entry, compilation, and statistical analysis.

Data Entry, Patient Exclusions, and Statistical Methods
Data were entered into a commercially available
spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel 2000; Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, Wash), and statistical analysis was
performed using a computerized software package
(JMP version 4.0; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We
previously reported the results from CFR in 1307
patients who had malignant tumors of the skull
base,18 and the current report focuses on a subset of
146 patients from that group who had a histologic
diagnosis of sarcoma (11%).
The follow-up interval was calculated in months
from the date of CFR to the date of last follow-up or
death, and the recurrence-free interval was calcu-

who reportedly died of noncancer-related causes (7
of 146 patients; 4.8%) and patients who were alive
with disease at last follow-up (12 of 146 patients;
8.2%) were censored. Recurrence-free survival (RFS),
OS, and DSS rates were calculated using the KaplanMeier method, and univariate comparisons between
groups were performed using the log-rank test. All P
values .05 were considered significant, and significant factors were entered into multivariate analysis
using the Cox proportional-hazards model. Nonparametric qualitative and quantitative comparisons were
performed using the Fisher exact test and the MannWhitney U test, respectively.

Patient Demographics
Patients ranged in age from 1 year to 75 years (median age, 39 years). Table 1 presents the demographic
data on these patients. Most patients were aged >21
years (n 5 112 patients; 77%), and 5 patients were
aged 70 years (3.4%).

which takes into consideration only tumor depth
(above or deep to the superficial fascia) and tumor
dimension (<5 cm or >5 cm). Because most of our
tumors were deep and measured 5 cm, and in the
absence of a conventional classification for SBS, we
adopted the AJCC staging criteria for nasal and paranasal epithelial tumors. The same classification system was used previously for other nonepithelial skull
base neoplasms, such as melanomas and soft tissue
sarcomas.18,19,21–23 Staging for 121 patients (83%) was
based on reported data and available information on
orbital and intracranial extension (see Table 3).

Treatment
Most patients had received some form of treatment
before CFR (59%). Previous treatment modalities included surgery (38%), radiotherapy (35%), and chemotherapy (24.5%). The details of prior radiation therapy
were available in 80 patients, and the dose ranged
from 28 grays (Gy) to 82 Gy (median dose, 50 Gy).
Adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy was received by 50 patients (34%) at a median dose of 60
Gy (range, 22–70 Gy). Adjuvant chemotherapy was
received by 9 patients (6%), and chemoradiation was
received by 5 patients (3.5%).
Follow-up
The follow-up interval ranged from 1 months to 171
months (median, of 34 months). The length followup was >3 years in 70 patients (45%).

RESULTS
Low-grade sarcoma occurred in 52 of our patients
(35.6%), and 94 patients had high-grade sarcoma
(64.4%). The most common types of sarcoma were
osteosarcoma (n 5 19 patients; 13%), rhabdomyosarcoma (n 5 17 patients; 11.6%), and fibrosarcoma
(n 5 14 patients; 9.6%). Table 2 summarizes the histologic diagnosis of the study patients. The majority
of patients had stage IV disease (81 of 146 patients;
55%). Only 2 patients had neck metastases. None of
the patients had distant metastases at the time of
surgery, because those with distant metastases
received chemotherapy and radiation instead of surgery. Orbital involvement was reported in 53% of
patients (n 5 78 patients), and the tumor involved
the orbital bone in approximately 50% of the patients

in that group (36 of 78 patients). Intracranial extension of the tumor (ie, infiltration of the dura or
brain) was reported in 28% of patients (n 5 41
patients). Table 3 summarizes the location, extent,
and stage of the tumors.
Details on surgery, reconstruction, and surgical
margins status are listed in Table 4. Close or microscopically positive margins were reported in 51 of
118 pathologic specimens (43%). The likelihood of
negative margins was 48% (38 of 79 patients) among
patients with high-grade tumors and 33% (13 of 39
patients) among patients with low-grade tumors. It is
noteworthy that there was no significant difference
in the risk of positive margins between the 2 groups
(P 5 .3).
Seventy-seven percent of patients underwent
reconstruction, and the most frequently used method
was a locoregional flap (ie, galeal pericranial and
temporalis muscle flaps), which was used in 59 of
113 patients (40%). Free flaps (rectus abdominis, radial forearm, and lateral thigh) were used in 26 of
113 patients (17.8%).
Data on postoperative complications were
recorded in 132 patients (Table 5). Overall, 40
patients (27%) developed a postoperative complication. The most common complications were related
to the local wound (17%) or the central nervous system (13.5%). The postoperative mortality rate was
1.4% (n 5 2 patients).

Prognostic Factors for Disease-Specific Survival

FIGURE 1. With a median follow-up of 34 months, the 5-year overall
(black), disease-specific (dotted line), and recurrence-free (gray line) survival
rates calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method were 62%, 64%, and 57%,
respectively.

With a median follow-up of 34 months (range,
1–171 months), the 5-year OS and DSS rates calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method were 62% and
64%, respectively (Fig. 1). The median time to recurrence after CFR was 17 months, and the 5-year RFS
rate was 57%. The majority of patients (60 of 77
patients; 78%) who were recurrence-free had been
followed for an interval longer than the median time
to recurrence (median, 42 months).
On univariate analysis, prior radiotherapy,
intraorbital invasion, and positive/close surgical margins were predictors of worse DSS (Table 6). Tumor
grade and adjuvant radiotherapy were not significant
predictors of survival. On multivariate analysis, a
positive/close surgical margin was the only independent predictor of worse DSS (relative risk, 2.4;
P 5 .006). The 5-year DSS was 77% in patients who
had negative margins and 34% in patients who had
positive/close margins (Fig. 2). There was no statistical difference in survival between the patients with
positive and close surgical margins.

DISCUSSION
Sarcomas constitute a heterogeneous group of
tumors that can originate in connective tissue, muscle, skeleton, vessels, or nerves. In adult patients
with sarcoma originating from all anatomic sites, a
poor prognosis is associated with large tumor size;
high histologic grade; invasion to bone, nerves, and
vessels; and positive surgical margins.13,24 Patients
who have SBS have a significantly worse outcome

sarcomas of the extremities or superficial trunk.12
This probably is related to the late detection of
tumors, but it also represents the surgical challenges
in resecting tumors at this location. The route of
spread for tumors that originate in the anterior skull
base and paranasal sinuses is determined by the
complex anatomy of the craniofacial compartments.
These tumors may invade laterally to the orbit and
middle cranial fossa, inferiorly to the maxillary
antrum and palate, posteriorly to the nasopharynx
and pterygopalatine fossa, and superiorly to the cavernous sinus, carotid artery, dura, and brain. The
proximity of the primary tumor to vital organs complicates tumor resection and adjuvant radiotherapy

FIGURE 2. Multivariate analysis identified a positive surgical excision margin as the only independent predictor of worse disease-specific survival

77% in patients who had negative margins and 34% in patients who had
positive or close margins.

and, thus, places these patients at risk for local
recurrence.
In this multicenter study, we combined data
from 17 different institutions on 146 patients with
soft tissue and bone sarcoma of the anterior skull
base and paranasal sinuses. Approximately 87% of
the tumors originated in soft tissue; the remaining
tumors were osteosarcomas. The 5-year actuarial
RFS rate was 57%, and the 5-year DSS and OS rates
were 64% and 62%, respectively. Compared with
other tumors of the anterior skull base, our data indicated that patients who had sarcoma had a better
prognosis than patients who had adenocarcinoma,
squamous cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, and malignant melanoma and a survival similar to that of patients who had minor salivary gland
tumors.18
Among adults, the most common sarcoma of
head and neck origin is osteosarcoma, followed by
malignant fibrous histiocytoma; whereas, in children,
rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common.7 In our
study, osteosarcoma and low-grade sarcoma were the
most common neoplasms. We identified only 1 previous publication that addressed the issue of sarcomas of various origins along the cranial fossa.
Among 63 patients in that study, it was reported that
chordoma and chondrosarcoma were the most common neoplasms of the middle cranial fossa.11 None
of our patients had these tumor types. It may be
argued that the previous series focused on a distinct
population of tumors (ie, distinct anatomic sites)
with different biologic behavior than the tumors presented in our current series.

Among patients with head and neck sarcoma,
those with chondrosarcoma or dermatofibrosarcoma
have the best prognosis, whereas those with osteosarcoma, angiosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma
have the poorest outcome.25 It is noteworthy that,
among patients who had tumors in the anterior cranial fossa, we did not observe differences in survival
between those with various tumor types. This may
be because most of our patients had advanced-stage
disease, and their tumors were located in proximity
to critical structures. Alternatively, the small number
of patients with each subtype of sarcoma may have
reduced the statistical power of the study.
The International Consensus Symposium on the
diagnosis and treatment of adult soft tissue sarcomas
in the head and neck determined that wide surgical
resection with negative margins is the treatment of
choice for patients with SBS.26 Nevertheless, it is difficult to achieve en bloc tumor resection in patients
who have sarcomas that infiltrate the anterior skull
base. Although tumor resection should be the objective of surgery, our series, along with other reports,
indicates that negative surgical margins are achieved
in <50% of patients.1 This high positive margin rate
may be related to the biologic behavior of SBS and
its proximity to the brain, dura and carotid artery,
cavernous sinus, and orbit. However, this rate is
higher than that reported for other anterior skull
base malignancies.18,19 A high rate of positive margins is of particular interest in view of our observation that this pathologic finding is associated with a
significantly poor outcome (positive histologic resection margin status can reduce DSS by 43%). Various
studies that examined patients with soft tissue and
bone sarcomas of the head and neck consistently
reported an association between positive margins
and a low survival rate.4,25,27,28 It also was reported
that positive surgical margins predicted poor survival
in patients with other malignant skull base
tumors18,19 and in patients with sarcomas at other
anatomic sites.10 In keeping with our results, the
results from a study at Princes Margaret Hospital in
Toronto indicated that the most common cause of
death in patients with head and neck sarcoma was
uncontrolled local recurrence caused by residual disease after surgery.13 For that reason, it was inferred
that microscopic resection margins should be
included in the staging system for soft tissue sarcomas.29 In agreement with those findings, we clearly
demonstrated the importance of the complete clearance of all overt tumor extensions, achieving both
macroscopic and microscopic clean margins. Unfortunately, the head and neck in general and the anterior skull base in particular are among the most

Analysis of Skull Base Sarcomas/Gil et al.

difficult anatomic regions for the establishment of
negative margins.29 Many of these patients reportedly
harbor residual tumor at the primary site, causing a
significant risk for local recurrence. These patients
potentially may benefit from undergoing re-excision
of the tumor.30 However, the benefit of re-excision in
patients with head and neck sarcomas or SBS is
undetermined.
It has been demonstrated that postoperative
radiotherapy improves local control of soft tissue sarcomas of various origins,10,31,32 although the benefit
of radiation therapy for treating SBS has not been
evaluated to date. Regardless of the lack of prospective studies on the benefit of radiotherapy for head
and neck sarcomas or SBS, there has been a significant increase in the use of adjuvant radiation therapy
for the treatment of this disease, especially in
patients who have high-grade tumors.25 Nonetheless,
our multivariate analysis failed to reveal differences
in survival between patients who underwent surgery
alone and patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy. One possible contributor to the failure of radiotherapy to improve survival may be the presence of
positive margins after surgery. Colville et al. reported
a benefit from radiotherapy for head and neck sarcomas only in patients who had negative surgical margins.16 Given our results after treatment of SBS, any
modifications in standard treatment recommendations should be made judiciously. Adjuvant radiotherapy generally is recommended for patients who
have undergone a marginal surgical resection or for
patients with high-grade sarcoma. Whether patients
with advanced-stage, low-grade sarcoma (ie, infiltrating the orbit, cribriform plate, pterygoid plates, or
dura) should be treated with adjuvant radiotherapy
remains an open question. The long-term side effects
of radiation become a consideration in these
patients, who generally are young or may be at risk
for radiation-induced sarcoma of the head and neck.
There also is significant debate regarding the
advantage of chemotherapy for the treatment of
head and neck sarcomas.26 A variety of chemotherapeutic agents, as either adjuvant or neoadjuvant
therapy, has been used in the treatment of head and
neck sarcomas based on the treatment of patients
with sarcomas involving the extremities.11,33 Unfortunately, with the exception of rhabdomyosarcoma,
most authors reported no advantage for chemotherapy in patients with head and neck sarcomas13 or
SBS.11 In general, sarcomas that occur in children
and young adults tend to be chemotherapy-sensitive,
particularly osteogenic sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,
and Ewing sarcoma.34 Conversely, in the more common situation of adult sarcomas, failure of chemo-

therapy occurs because of a high incidence of
multidrug resistance.35 To date, the use of chemotherapy as postoperative adjuvant therapy or in a
preoperative setting in an effort to decrease the
extent of locoregional treatment is not established
completely as a standard of care.36 Hence, except for
certain sensitive tumors, chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy should be reserved for clinical trials
or should be applied in a palliative setting for
patients who have inoperable tumors or distant metastases.26
Our analysis suggests that patients with SBS
have a high risk for tumor recurrence regardless of
the tumor grade. In the high-grade group, 43% of
patients had tumor recurrence compared with 40%
in the low-grade group. In agreement with our data,
a study from the University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center on 799 patients with sarcoma of various origins also failed to demonstrate a survival benefit in patients with low-grade tumors.10 It is
noteworthy that, whereas some studies on head and
neck sarcomas have suggested that grade is a prognostic indicator for survival,1,13 other studies on sarcomas of all anatomic sites and on sarcomas isolated
to the head and neck reported no significant association between local recurrence and tumor grade.11,37
In the current study, we demonstrated that, in the
skull base in particular, patients have a high risk for
tumor recurrence regardless of tumor grade. This
probably is because of the close proximity of the
tumor to critical structures (ie, cranial nerves, orbit,
and brain). The same anatomic constraints also curtail the ability to obtain wide surgical resection (with
negative margins) and the delivery of high-dose
radiotherapy (because of the risk of radiation-associated complications).
Head and neck sarcomas rarely metastasize to
neck lymph nodes. In our series, the rate of locoregional metastases from SBS was 2%, similar to that
reported for head and neck sarcomas in general.4
Because neck lymph nodes rarely are encountered in
patients with SBS, neck dissection should only be
performed if regional metastases are identified based
on clinical and radiologic evaluation.
Our study raises a few questions in view of the
high rate of residual disease in both low-grade and
high-grade SBS: 1) Should patients with low-grade
sarcoma undergo radical surgery similar to patients
with high-grade sarcoma? 2) Should surgical margins
be evaluated using frozen sectioning after gross tumor extirpation? 3) Should these patients undergo
re-resection in case of unplanned excision or if gross
positive margins are reported? 4) Finally, should
postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy be administered

to patients who have positive/close surgical margins
or for high-grade tumors? Because of the lack of randomized data, it is difficult to delineate treatment
guidelines for patients with sarcomas of the anterior
cranial fossa. Because the only prospective, randomized trials that recommend adjuvant radiotherapy
were based on a population of patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities,29,32 whether postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy will improve the
survival of patients who have SBS (both low-grade
and high-grade) with or without positive surgical
margins remains a matter of debate and awaits further studies.
The current study presents some obvious weaknesses that arise in this type of retrospective data
collection and analysis. Similar to other studies that
involved patients who were treated over a relatively
long time, our study is susceptible to potential contamination of the data with tumors of other histologic types rather than soft tissue or bone sarcoma.
In addition, accurately subtyping sarcoma on the
basis of histology and immunohistochemistry alone
often can be difficult. Although molecular methods,
such as karyotyping, have improved the ability of
pathologists to classify sarcomas, these techniques
are not feasible on retrospective analysis. In our
study, 63 of 146 patients had tumors that were diagnosed as sarcoma not otherwise specified, and it is
conceivable that a proportion of them would be
reclassified if the histologic material were examined
prospectively, especially with newer techniques.
Given the limitations of this multicenter study,
many of the controversies regarding SBS will have
to await further study.
Nevertheless, the relatively large group of
patients, along with the detailed set of data available
for analysis, enabled us to analyze independent predictors of outcome. Such a multivariate analysis
approach was not feasible previously because of the
infrequent occurrence of sarcomas of the anterior
cranial fossa.
In conclusion, this collaborative analysis of
patients who received treatment at various institutions across the world demonstrated the efficacy of
CFR in the management of anterior skull base soft
tissue and bone sarcomas. Regardless of tumor
grade, total surgical resection with negative margins
is crucial to achieve acceptably disease-free survival,
with or without adjuvant radiation therapy. Morbidity
and mortality after CFR for SBS is relatively low, suggesting that this surgical approach is appropriate for
the treatment of patients with anterior SBS. Further
study is needed to define the value of radiation therapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery.
