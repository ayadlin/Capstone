ABSTRACT
Lytic induction of latent Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has
been considered as a therapeutic option for efficient treatment of several KSHVassociated malignancies. Here, we developed a robust high-throughput screening
system that allows an easy and quantitative measurement of lytic induction of latent
KSHV and discovered three anthracyclines as potent inducers from screen of FDAapproved drugs. Lytic induction of latent KSHV by three compounds was verified by
the significant induction of lytic genes and subsequent production of infectious KSHV.
Importantly, lytic induction by three compounds was much more efficient than that
by sodium butyrate, a well-characterized inducer of KSHV lytic cycle. Mechanistically,
the anthracyclines caused lytic induction of KSHV through apoptosis induced by their
DNA intercalation rather than topoisomerase II inhibition. Consequently, our results
clearly demonstrated a role of anthracyclines as effective lytic inducers of KSHV
and also provided a molecular basis of their use for efficient treatment of diseases
associated with KSHV infection.

INTRODUCTION

multicentric Castleman’s disease [1, 2]. KSHV causes
malignancies in individuals immunocompromised due
to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
or immunosuppressive drug therapies following
transplantations. KS is the most common malignancy

(KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8),

associated with several malignancies, such as Kaposi’s

associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS). The majority of KSHV exists in a latent form
in tumor cells, although a small population undergoes
lytic replication. Even though highly-active antiretroviral
therapies have dramatically reduced the incidence of KS
in HIV-infected patients, KS remains the most common
AIDS-associated malignancy in developed countries and is
one of the most common cancers in developing countries.
Like other herpesviruses, KSHV exhibits two
distinct life cycle phases after infection: lytic and latent
replication. KSHV primarily establishes a lifelong latent
infection in lymphocytes and endothelial cells, wherein
the viral genome expresses only a subset of proteins,
and its limited replication uses cellular machinery. Once
the virus is reactivated from latency and enters the lytic
cycle, most viral genes are expressed in a highly-ordered
fashion (immediate-early, early, and late) [3], leading to
production of infectious virions [4, 5].
The KSHV transition from the latent to lytic phase
is tightly regulated by replication and transcription
activator (RTA), a potent viral transactivator encoded
by open reading frame (ORF) 50 [6]. RTA is necessary
and sufficient to activate lytic replication in latentlyinfected cells [6-8]. RTA transcriptionally activates its
own promoter and those of many lytic genes, including
polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA, ORF57, ORF21,
and ORF36. In particular, the expression of PAN RNA is
directly regulated by RTA. PAN RNA is the most abundant
transcript among lytic genes and the regulatory elements in
the PAN promoter are well-defined. Thus, PAN promoter
activity has been prevalently used to easily assess lytic
induction of KSHV [9].
Many antiviral drugs currently used to target KSHV
are based on the inhibition of lytic replication [10]. For
example, gancyclovir (GCV) is a nucleoside analog that
is modified by viral proteins and eventually inhibits viral
DNA polymerase activity [11, 12]. These drugs only target
lytic KSHV and leave latent KSHV to be eradicated.
Therefore, efficient lytic induction should be combined
with lytic replication inhibition to fully treat KSHVassociated diseases. Lytic replication of KSHV can be
induced in cultured cells by treatment with the phorbol
ester, 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate, or calcium
ionophores. These compounds induce RTA expression,
subsequently triggering a cascade of lytic gene expression.
However, their use in the clinical setting is hampered
by severe side effects. Valproic acid, bortezomib, and
prostratin induce lytic replication in KSHV-infected PEL
cells [13-15]. Although these compounds have therapeutic
potential, their effectiveness needs to be evaluated in
vivo. Therefore, new therapeutic candidates need to be
identified and evaluated in vivo. The identification of
therapeutic candidate(s) from FDA-approved drugs is
favorable because they have been proven safe in clinical
settings, thus facilitating their therapeutic application to
KSHV-associated diseases.

In this study, we developed a robust assay system
based on luciferase as a reporter for quantitatively
measuring lytic induction of KSHV. This system was used
to screen approximately 650 FDA-approved drugs. Three
anthracyclines were identified as potent and effective
lytic inducers of KSHV by causing lytic induction in
greater than 95% of cells. In contrast, sodium butyrate
(SB) treatment resulted in lytic replication in only 5%
of cells. Moreover, their unusual modes of action, RTAindependent activation of PAN promoter and apoptosismediated lytic induction, were found. Consequently,
our results provided a molecular basis of the use of
anthracyclines for KSHV-associated diseases.

RESULTS
Development of a high-throughput screening
system for quantitatively measuring lytic
induction of latent KSHV
The vero-rKSHV.219 cell line was previously
established and has been prevalently used to investigate
lytic induction of latent KSHV and to identify smallmolecule inducers [16]. In this cell system, the expression
of RFP is controlled by the PAN promoter. PAN is a
representative lytic gene and its expression is highly
responsive to RTA protein, thereby allowing for easy
monitoring of lytic induction of latent KSHV. However,
in our preliminary experiments with SB, a wellcharacterized lytic inducer, the RFP signal was too low
and was restricted to only a small portion of cells for
quantification. Therefore, we sought to develop a more
robust assay system (vero-rKSHV.219/PAN-LUC) for
easy and quantitative measurement of lytic induction of
KSHV. We additionally introduced a PAN-LUC reporter,
in which the luciferase gene is also expressed under the
control of the PAN promoter, into the host genome of
vero-rKSHV.219 cells (Figure 1A).
To evaluate the sensitivity of the new cells to lytic
induction, the parental cells (vero-rKSHV.219) and the
new cells (vero-rKSHV.219/PAN-LUC) were treated with
SB in a dose-dependent manner. PAN RNA levels and the
expression of both reporters (RFP and luciferase) were
quantitatively measured for further comparison. In the
parental cells, PAN RNA levels that were determined by
real-time PCR analysis, gradually increased following SB
treatment and were highest at 5 mM (Figure 1B), which
is consistent with previous observations [16, 17]. On the
contrary, the RFP signal, which reflects PAN promoter
activity, was measured on a fluorescence reader and was
barely responsive under the same conditions (Figure 1C).
The discrepancy between RFP signals and actual levels of
PAN RNA indicates that the RFP reporter system is not
a sensitive measurement of lytic induction. Nevertheless,
8516

the RFP reporter system is valuable for assessing whether
lytic induction occurs globally or in only a portion of
cells by visualizing the lytic induction using fluorescence
microscopy.
In contrast, the new cell system (vero-rKSHV.219/
PAN-LUC) responded well to SB treatment, as judged by

more than 20-fold increases in luciferase activity at 1 and 5
mM SB (Figure 1D). The highest activity of luciferase was
observed at 1 mM SB, while the highest PAN RNA levels
were detected at 5 mM SB by real-time PCR analysis.
Therefore, the new cell system based on luciferase activity
is more sensitive than the previous system (Figures 1B

with various concentrations of sodium butyrate (SB) for 24 hours. PAN transcripts were quantified by real-time PCR. The amount of PAN
RNA in the DMSO-treated sample was set to one, and relative fold increases were calculated. Error bars represent standard deviations (SDs)

were treated with various concentrations of SB for 24 hours. Firefly luciferase activity was measured using One-Glo reagents. Luciferase

from two independent experiments.

SB. Daunorubicin induced the highest RFP expression
(Figure 4A). The red fluorescence signal from RFP was
also observed in all cells treated with the three individual
compounds or SB. Unlike SB treatment that only induced
RFP signals in a small portion of cells (<3%), treatment
with any of the three compounds dramatically induced
RFP signals in most of the cell population (>98%) (Figure
4B and Supplementary Figure 1). This observation
that the three anthracyclines, newly identified as lytic
inducers, affected the large majority of cells rather than
only a limited number of cells is of great importance with
regard to the effectiveness of lytic induction and complete
eradication of latent KSHV via efficient lytic induction.
To further confirm lytic induction of KSHV, we
examined the expression of other lytic genes in addition to
PAN RNA. The three compounds efficiently induced the
expression of all tested lytic genes (RTA, PAN, ORF57,
ORF21, and ORF36) and SB only showed slight induction
of each gene (Figure 4C). Consistent with the data in
Figures 3 and 4A, Daunorubicin exhibited the highest

Identification of three anthracyclines as lytic
inducers of KSHV
Very few compounds have been reported to induce
lytic replication of KSHV [13-15], and their clinical
potentials need to be extensively evaluated. Therefore,
we sought to identify new compound(s), particularly
from previously FDA-approved drugs, with which
clinical application for KSHV-associated diseases
would be more feasible. To compare the effectiveness
of lytic induction of KSHV, SB was included as a
positive control. From screening of approximately 650
FDA-approved drugs, three compounds were identified
that showed significant increases in luciferase activity,
thus indicating lytic induction of KSHV (Figure 2A).
Surprisingly, the compounds are all topoisomerase II
inhibitors (Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin, and Epirubicin)
and are structurally related to each other (Figures 2B,
2C, and 2D). They are classified as anthracyclines
capable of intercalating DNA [18, 19], which majorly
induce cytotoxic effect in cancer cells and enable them
to be used to treat a wide range of cancers [20-22]. Of
the three, Daunorubicin exhibited the highest luciferase
activity, which was greater than that of SB (Figure 2A).
Luciferase activities did increase following Doxorubicin
or Epirubicin treatments, and they were comparable to
that following SB treatment. These results indicate that
some function of anthracyclines is associated with lytic
induction of KSHV.

To determine drug potency, vero-rKSHV.219/
PAN-LUC cells were treated with various doses of the
three compounds and SB as a positive control. All three
compounds induced gradual increases in luciferase
activity, with their highest activities (> 30-fold increases
over the DMSO control) at 10 µM (Figure 3A, 3B, and
3C). The highest activities for each compound were greater
than or comparable to that of SB. Epirubicin further
induced luciferase activity at 50 µM, while luciferase
activity induced by Doxorubicin or Daunorubicin
decreased at the same concentration, which may have been
caused by cell toxicity.
To confirm that the three anthracyclines function
as lytic inducers, the expression of another reporter,
RFP, was analyzed by Western blotting and visualization
of RFP signals. Consistent with the data from the PANLUC reporter, RFP expression was also detected in
samples treated with the three individual compounds or

induced by SB were extremely low and barely detectable.
These results indicate that the three compounds induced
lytic replication accompanying lytic gene expression
and subsequent production of infectious KSHV in verorKSHV.219 cells.

Anthracyclines produced infectious KSHV via
lytic induction

Anthracyclines induced lytic gene expression in
human B-cell lymphoma BCBL1 cells naturally

Lytic induction accompanies a cascade of lytic gene
expression and subsequent viral production followed by
virus release and infection of other cells [23]. Therefore,
we analyzed the late stage of the KSHV lytic cycle by
harvesting cell media containing released KSHV for
reinfecting naïve cells. Vero-rKSHV.219 cells were treated
with the three individual compounds for 24 hours, and
culture media were collected. Thereafter, naïve cells were
incubated with these media for 48 hours, and the newlyinduced GFP signals were analyzed. The rKSHV.219
genome contains the GFP gene under the control of the
mammalian elongation factor 1a (EF-1a) promoter, which
allows for efficient expression of GFP in host cells after
rKSHV.219 infection. The detection of GFP signals in
naïve cells after incubation with cell media indicates the
production and release of infectious virus from parental
cells (vero-rKSHV.219). Naïve vero cells exhibited strong
GFP signals after incubation with culture media from
cells treated with the three compounds (Figure 5A). A
similar pattern was also observed in human HEK293 cells
incubated with identical cell media (Figure 5B). Compared
to the GFP signals induced by the three compounds, those

Lytic induction in response to the three
anthracyclines was demonstrated in nonhuman vero
cells. We examined the lytic-inducing effect of the
three compounds in human B-cell lymphoma (BCBL1) cells that were naturally infected with KSHV. To
optimize the conditions of compound treatment, the
lytic-inducing effect of Daunorubicin, which consistently
showed the highest activities in every experiment, was
first investigated. BCBL1 cells were transfected with
plasmid expressing luciferase under the control of the
PAN promoter and treated with Daunorubicin for various
times (6, 12, and 18 hours). As a result, incubation with
Daunorubicin at 0.4 and 2 µM for 18 hours induced
the highest luciferase activity (Supplementary Figure
2). Therefore, the other compounds were also tested
under these conditions in the following experiments. As
expected, all three compounds significantly induced the
luciferase activity of the PAN promoter more than 2-fold,
particularly at 2 µM (Figure 6), in spite of slight decreases
in cell viability (Supplementary Figure 3). Consistent with

luciferase under the control of the PAN promoter. At 12 hours post-transfection, cells were treated with increasing doses of Doxorubicin,
Daunorubicin, or Epirubicin for 18 hours and assayed for firefly luciferase activity. SB (3 mM) was used as a positive control. The luciferase
activities in the DMSO-treated samples were set to 100%, and relative activities were calculated. Averages and SDs were determined from

the data in vero cells (Figure 3 and 4), the treatment of
Daunorubicin also exhibited the highest luciferase activity
in BCBL1 cells, even though its activity was lower than
that of SB. Therefore, the three compounds induced lytic
gene expression in human B-cell lymphoma naturally
infected with KSHV as they did in vero cells.

generation of free radicals, and induction of histone
eviction from chromatin [18, 19]. In order to determine
whether topoisomerase II inhibition is crucial for lytic
induction of KSHV, we tested additional topoisomerase
II inhibitors that are structurally different from
anthracyclines and do not intercalate DNA. Particularly,
we included two known topoisomerase II catalytic
inhibitors (Novobiocin and Merbarone) (Figure 8A).
Surprisingly, topoisomerase II inhibitors other than three
anthracyclines had no effect on lytic induction of KSHV
even at the highest concentrations (100 or 50 µM) (Figure
8B or Supplementary Figure 5, respectively). Note that
IC50s of Novobiocin and Merbarone for topoisomerase
II were consistently reported as 10-20 µM [27]. These
results suggest that anthracyclines have an effect on
lytic induction of KSHV most probably through DNA
intercalation rather than topoisomerase II inhibition.

Anthracyclines induced expression of lytic genes
independently of viral proteins
Many compounds that induce lytic replication
upregulate expression of lytic genes in an RTA-dependent
manner [24] by upregulating RTA expression that then
induces a cascade of downstream gene activation. To
determine if the three topoisomerase II inhibitors also
function in this manner, vero-rKSHV.219 cells were
transfected with plasmids expressing luciferase under
the control of PAN or RTA promoters, and treated with
the three compounds. All three compounds induced the
PAN promoter-controlled luciferase activity by more
than 3-fold (Figure 7B). Similarly, the luciferase activity
controlled by the RTA promoter was enhanced by more
than 4-fold (Figure 7A). These data suggest that the three
compounds likely induce PAN promoter activity in an
RTA-dependent manner. However, further experiments
redirected our preliminary conclusion.
To determine whether viral proteins are involved
in lytic induction in response to the three compounds,
we performed the same experiments with vero cells.
Uninfected vero cells were transfected with plasmids
expressing luciferase under the control of the PAN or RTA
promoters and were treated with the three compounds.
Strikingly, all three compounds induced luciferase
activity of both PAN and RTA promoters to similar extents
(Figure 7C and 7D), indicating that activation of the PAN
promoter is actually independent of RTA activation.
Consequently, the three compounds functioned on both
promoters separately. Moreover, the promoter activation
was not dependent on viral protein(s) because there were
no viral proteins in uninfected vero cells. Viral proteinindependent activation of the PAN promoter was also
confirmed by the significant increase in luciferase activity
in BJAB cells, a human B-cell lymphoma line without
KSHV infection [25, 26], following treatment with the
three compounds (Supplementary Figure 4). Collectively,
these results demonstrated that the three anthracycliness
regulate the PAN and RTA promoters individually and
their activation is not dependent on any viral proteins as
effectors.

Lytic induction of KSHV by anthracyclinesinduced apoptosis
Recently, it has been proposed that KSHV lytic
activation is alternatively initiated through apoptosis
[28]. In this study, cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents
including doxorubicin were demonstrated to induce lytic
replication of KSHV. These previous report in conjuction
with our observation suggest that only DNA-intercalating
anthracyclines out of various topoisomerase II inhibitors
might activate lytic replication of KSHV through
inducing apoptosis. On the contrary, other topoisomerase
II inhibitors which are not capable of intercalating DNA
might not induce apoptosis as sufficiently as to attain
KSHV activation. In order to prove this hypothesis, we
examined the involvement of apoptosis in anthracyclinesinduced lytic induction of KSHV. In order to correlate
lytic-inducing capability of anthracyclines with apoptosis,
apoptosis was simply analyzed by detecting PARP
cleavage, which is a representative event during this
process [29]. As expected, only three anthracyclines
exhibited an obvious cleavage of PARP, while other
topoisomerase II inhibitors had no effect (Figure 8C).
These results suggest that three anthracyclines including
doxorubicin induced lytic replication of KSHV through
inducing apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
Latent infection of KSHV makes it difficult to
achieve complete eradication of KSHV with the currently
available antiviral drugs. This is why lytic induction of
latent KSHV combined with known antiviral drugs is
considered an efficient therapeutic option for treatment
of KSHV-associated diseases. However, very few
compounds have been identified as lytic inducers and
their clinical potential needs to be evaluated further.

Lytic induction of KSHV by anthracyclines is not
dependent on topoisomerase II inhibition
Anthracyclines have several mechanisms of action
such as topoisomerase II inhibition, DNA intercalation,

More importantly, their effectivenesss for lytic induction
of KSHV is too poor to achieve complete eradication of
KSHV from infected cells. In our study, we identified
three anthracyclines (Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin, and
Epirubicin) as unprecedently effective lytic inducers from
a screen of approximately 650 FDA-approved drugs.
We first developed a robust assay system that
quantitatively measures lytic induction of KSHV in
vero-rKSHV.219 cells that have been prevalently used
by many researchers [16, 30, 31]. In our preliminary
experiments, the original vero-rKSHV.219 cells containing
the RFP gene under the control of the PAN promoter
were not sensitive enough to be used for high-throughput
screening. Therefore, we introduced a highly-sensitive
reporter luciferase (PAN-LUC) whose expression is
controlled by the PAN promoter into vero-rKSHV.219
cells. Greatly improved sensitivity was demonstrated by
the use of sodium butyrate (SB) as a representative lytic
inducer of KSHV (Figure 1). This upgraded system (verorKSHV.219/PAN-LUC) allowed for high-throughput
screening with high sensitivity and analysis of the
effectiveness of candidate compounds at a single-cell level
by visualizing the RFP signal.
Several lines of evidence demonstrated that the three
anthracyclines are potent and effective lytic inducers of
KSHV in nonhuman cells (vero) and human B-cell
lymphoma cells (BCBL1) naturally infected with KSHV.
First, the three compounds dose-dependently induced the
expression of luciferase under the control of the PAN or
RTA promoters in BCBL1 and vero cells (Figure 6 and 3,
respectively). Second, their lytic-inducing activities were
confirmed by increases in RFP expression, another reporter
in vero-rKSHV.219 cells (Figures 4A and 4B). Third, the
three compounds dramatically induced expression of lytic
genes (RTA, PAN, ORF57, ORF21, and ORF36) in verorKSHV.219 cells as determined by RT-PCR (Figures 4C
and 4D). Fourth, all three compounds efficiently produced
infectious viruses from vero-rKSHV.219 cells that were
judged by the GFP signal in newly-infected vero and
HEK293 cells (Figure 5).
The effectiveness of anthracyclines as lytic inducers
was consistently higher than or comparable to that of SB
throughout most of the experiments (Figures 2, 3, 4, and
5). More importantly, lytic induction induced by the three
compounds was observed in more than 95% of the cells,
while SB induced lytic replication in less than 5% of
the cells as assessed by RFP signals in vero-rKSHV.219
cells (Figure 4B). Similarly, the effectiveness of the three
compounds was observed by using viruses produced
following treatment with the compounds for reinfection.
The titer of viruses produced following treatment with
the three compounds was much higher than that produced
by SB (Figure 5). Collectively, these results demonstrate
that anthracyclines are much more effective drugs for
achieving efficient lytic induction of KSHV than is SB.
How do anthracyclines induce lytic replication?
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Many lytic-inducing compounds, including SB, induce
RTA expression that subsequently triggers a cascade
of lytic gene expression. Unlike these compounds,
the three anthracyclines acted on both of the PAN and
RTA promoters individually rather than by following a
cascade of lytic gene activation (Figure 7). Moreover,
lytic induction by the three compounds is not dependent
on any viral proteins (Figure 7). The study with other
topoisomerase II inhibitors revealed that lytic induction by
anthracyclines is not related to topoisomerase II inhibition
(Figure 8B and Supplementary Figure 5). Rather, DNA
intercalating activity which only anthracyclines have
is likely to be crucial. Anthracyclines are capable of
intercalating into DNA base pairs and cause inhibition
of DNA replication, thus allowing them to work as
chemotherapeutic drugs for a wide range of cancers [19,
32]. Nevertheless, we cannot completely exclude the
possibility that other functions of anthracyclines such
as generation of free radicals and induction of histone
eviction from chromatin might be contributing to lytic
induction of KSHV. Intriguingly, it has been recently
proposed that KSHV activation is induced by apoptosis
[28]. In this study, doxorubicin, one of anthracyclines,
was demonstrated to induce KSHV activation by inducing
apoptosis. Our studies extended this previous observation
by showing that anthracyclines in addition to doxorubicin
commonly induce lytic replication of KSHV through
apoptosis, particularly, induced by their DNA intercalation
rather than topoisomerase II inhibition (Figure 8). Still, it
remains unclear how apoptosis activates the transcription
of PAN/RTA genes. Further investigation will clarify this
issue.
Topoisomerase II inhibitors have been recently
reported to be inhibitors of lytic and latent KSHV
replication [27, 33]. Our finding demonstrates another
effect of anthracyclines, a class of topoisomerase II
inhibitors, as potent and effective lytic inducers of KSHV.
Even though anthracyclines have not been tested so far, it
is conceivable that they will be functioning as inhibitors of
lytic and latent KSHV replication as other topoisomerase
II inhibitors. Since a single compound can function as an
efficient inducer of the lytic cycle, as well as an inhibitor
of lytic and latent replication, anthracyclines could be
considered an ideal class of drug for treatment of KSHVassociated diseases. Anthracyclines have already been
FDA-approved as chemotherapy drugs for various cancers
such as hematological malignancies, many types of
carcinoma, and soft tissue sarcomas (30, 31). Doxorubicin,
one of anthracyclines identified here, is currently being
used as a therapy even for Kaposi’s sarcoma [34-36].
Regardless of the multiple actions of anthracyclines on the
KSHV life cycle, a combination of these anthracyclines
with known antiviral drugs, such as GCV, is worth
consideration as another option for the effective treatment
of KSHV-associated diseases. Likewise, Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV), another virus in the gammaherpesvirus
8523

Oncotarget

subfamily, is reactivated following treatment with
Doxorubicin [11], suggesting that anthracyclines may have
broad potential treatment of gammaherpesvirus subfamilyrelated diseases. The evaluation of the therapeutic
potential of these anthracyclines in an MHV68-infected
animal model will be pursued in future studies.
Here, we identified three anthracyclines as potent
and effective lytic inducers of KSHV. These FDAapproved drugs will provide various therapeutic options
for KSHV-associated diseases.

rKSHV.219/PAN-LUC cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were
seeded in each well of 96-well plates and incubated with
10 μM individual drugs for 24 hours. Firefly luciferase
activity was measured using a One-Glo Luciferase Assay
System (Promega) as per the manufacturer’s protocol.

Luciferase assays for lytic induction of KSHV

African green monkey kidney cells (vero), verorKSHV.219 cells, and human embryonic kidney 293 cells
(HEK293) were maintained in DMEM medium containing
10% FBS (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.
Vero-rKSHV.219 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Jae U.
Jung (University of Southern California). Primary effusion
lymphoma cells (BCBL-1) naturally-infected with KSHV
and B-cell lymphoma cells (BJAB) were grown in RPMI
1640 medium (Welgene) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Welgene) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

To measure induction of the RTA and PAN
promoters in response to the active compounds from the
high-throughput screen, vero and vero-rKSHV.219 cells (3
× 105 cells/well) in 6-well plates were transfected with 2
μg of the reporter plasmids pGL3-Rp [38] and pGL4.14PAN-LUC using X-tremeGENE DNA transfection
reagent. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were
incubated with various concentrations of Doxorubicin,
Daunorubicin, or Epirubicin for 24 hours and assayed for
firefly luciferase activity. BCBL-1 cells (2 × 106 cells/well)
were seeded in 6-well plates 3 hours prior to transfection
with 4 μg of reporter plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000
(Promega). Twelve hours post-transfection, various
concentrations of Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin, or
Epirubicin were added for 18 hours, and firefly luciferase
activities were measured. Cell viability was also measured
using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assays
(Promega) as per the manufacturer’s protocol.

in vero-rKSHV.219 cells

To construct the pGL4.14-PAN-LUC reporter
plasmid, DNA spanning nt -122 to +14 of the PAN
promoter [37] was obtained from vero-rKSHV.219
cells using RT-PCR with appropriate primers (forward,
5’-TGGCCTAACTGGCCGGTACCAGGGT
CAGCTTGAAGGATGAT-3’
and
reverse,
5’-CCGGATTGCCAAGCTTTGGGCAGTCCC
AGTGCTAAAC-3’) and inserted into Kpn I/Hind
III restriction sites of pGL4.14 (Promega). Plasmids
were transfected into vero-rKSHV.219 cells using
X-tremeGENE siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche), and
transfectants were selected using puromycin (1 μg/mL)
for more than 1 week. Selected colonies were individually
amplified and treated with 3 mM SB for 24 hours. Cells
(vero-rKSHV.219/PAN-LUC) showing the highest
responsiveness to SB were chosen and maintained for
further experiments.

Vero-rKSHV.219 cells incubated with Doxorubicin,
Daunorubicin, or Epirubicin for 24 hours were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Fixed cells were
washed with PBS twice and RFP signals were visualized
using fluorescence microscopy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture

Quantitative Western blot analysis
Quantitative Western blot analyses were performed
as previously described [39]. Briefly, whole-cell extracts
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF
membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked
in 5% skim milk and incubated overnight at 4°C. Proteins
that reacted with antibodies were detected on membranes
using a WEST-ZOL Plus Western blotting detection
system (Intron Biotechnology) and analyzed with an LAS4000 image analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Anti-RFP,
-GAPDH, and -PARP antibodies were purchased from
MBL International, Sigma, and Abcam, respectively.
Anti-hnRNP A1 antibody was kindly provided by Gideon
Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania).
