Abstract
IRE1 transduces the unfolded protein response by splicing XBP1 through its
C-terminal cytoplasmic kinase-RNase region. IRE1 autophosphorylation is coupled to
RNase activity through formation of a back-to-back dimer, although the conservation
of the underlying molecular mechanism is not clear from existing structures. We have
crystallized human IRE1 in a back-to-back conformation only previously seen for the
yeast homologue. In our structure the kinase domain appears primed for catalysis but
the RNase domains are disengaged. Structure-function analysis reveals that IRE1 is
autoinhibited through a Tyr-down mechanism related to that found in the unrelated
Ser/Thr protein kinase Nek7. We have developed a compound that potently inhibits
human IRE1 kinase activity while stimulating XBP1 splicing. A crystal structure of
the inhibitor bound to IRE1 shows an increased ordering of the kinase activation
loop. The structures of hIRE in apo and ligand-bound forms are consistent with a
previously proposed model of IRE1 regulation in which formation of a back-to-back
dimer coupled to adoption of a kinase-active conformation drive RNase activation.
The structures provide opportunities for structure-guided design of IRE1 inhibitors.

Introduction

domain in the ER lumen and a cytoplasmic kinase/
ribonuclease domain which are connected by a single-pass
transmembrane helix [4]. The lumenal domains dimerise
in response to ER stress bringing the cytoplasmic domains
together [5]. IRE1 then undergoes autophosphorylation,
generating a specific endoribonuclease activity that
hydrolyses 2 stem-loops in the pre-mRNA for a bZIP
transcription factor [5, 6]. Re-ligation of the RNA results
in a frame shift, and subsequently an active transcription
factor is translated, HAC1 in yeast and XBP1 in metazoans
[7], which increases transcription of UPR target genes [1,
2].
Recent evidence has linked the UPR to numerous
diseases. Specifically, the pro-survival IRE1-XBP1
pathway has a role in disease progression for inflammatory
bowel diseases, metabolic disorders and cancers [8-

The endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for
folding secretory proteins. At homeostasis the folding
capacity of the ER and the amount of secretory protein
synthesis are balanced. However, if protein synthesis
eclipses folding capacity, the accumulation of misfolded
protein is sensed and a recovery mechanism, termed the
unfolded protein response (UPR), is activated. Initially,
UPR signaling reduces protein translation and increases
the ER lumen volume and protein folding capacity,
however if homeostasis cannot be restored the UPR
signals for the cell to undergo apoptosis [1, 2].
The most evolutionarily conserved UPR pathway
is the IRE1-bZIP pathway [3]. IRE1 resides in the
ER membrane. It has an N-terminal stress sensing

11]. The requirement for the IRE1-XBP1 pathway in
myeloma and the recent discovery of a key function for
this pathway in the progression of aggressive, triplenegative breast cancer has meant that IRE1 has become
the focus of several drug discovery programs [12-16]. A
detailed understanding of the IRE1 activation mechanism
in humans will accelerate therapeutic development.
The regulation of IRE1 RNase activity is unusual
and not completely understood, but key parameters are
known. RNase activity is coupled to autophosphorylation
of the kinase domain activation loop, which is separated
from the RNase active site by approximately 50 Å [17,
18]. Although it might be expected that ATP-competitive
inhibitors that inhibit autophosphorylation would also
block RNase activity, a subset of inhibitors stimulate
RNase activity [19], perhaps by stabilizing a conformation
that mimics phosphorylated IRE1. The structure of
phosphorylated yeast IRE1 (yIRE1), which represents a
state of high RNase activity, revealed a dimer in a backto-back conformation [20]. The kinase N-lobe and RNase
domains form extensive contacts in the dimeric interface
and a continuous surface is formed by the united RNase
domains. Within the kinase domain, the active-site
resembles a canonical kinase active site and the activation
loop is stabilized [18, 20, 21]. By contrast the structure
of the dephosphorylated human IRE1 (hIRE1)-ADP
complex, which represents a state of low RNase activity,
shows hIRE1 protomers in a face-to-face orientation in
which the RNase domains are widely separated [22]. This
orientation of the kinase domains directs the activation
loop of one IRE1 molecule towards the active site of the
facing IRE1 molecules, and thus provides a rationale
for the mechanism of reciprocal autophosphorylation in
trans. However, the kinase active site is lacking several
hallmarks of an active kinase, as is often the case in
structures of kinases determined without the activating
phosphorylation [23]. Recently published structures
of murine IRE1 (mIRE1) in complex with ADP and
RNase domain inhibitors also exhibit face-to-face dimer
conformations formed from protomers that, similar to
hIRE1 bound to ADP, are in kinase-inactive conformations
[24]. The conformation adopted by hIRE1 and mIRE1
ADP complexes is incompatible with back-to-back dimer
formation [24, 25]. The structure of hIRE1 bound to an
ATP-competitive inhibitor of kinase and RNase activity
forms neither back-to-back dimers nor face-to-face dimers,
suggesting perhaps that the compounds might stabilize a
monomeric form of IRE1 [26].
These important structures underpin the current
model of IRE1 RNase activation, in which transautophosphorylation between face-to-face IRE1 dimers
generates an active RNase through back-to-back
dimerization and higher-order multimerisation [18, 20,
25]. However, because the existing structures of the
yeast and human/murine proteins exhibit very different
overall conformations generated by dimerization through
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

distinct interfaces, and because there are differences in
their primary sequences at these interfaces, the extent
to which the mechanisms of regulation are conserved
is not completely clear. For example, although there
is biochemical evidence in support of a back-to-back
dimer of murine IRE1 [24], it is not known how closely
it resembles the yeast structure. In this current work we
present the structure of dephosphorylated human IRE1
in apo form and as a kinase inhibitor-bound complex. In
these structures, hIRE1 forms a back-to-back dimer in
which the protomers are twisted relative to their relative
conformations in structures of yIRE1.

Results
Crystal structure of apo-hIRE1 as a back-to-back
dimer
The cytoplasmic region of human IRE1 (residues
547-977; hIRE1) was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda
(Sf9) cells. Purified, dephosphorylated hIRE1 (Figure
S1A) crystallized in the absence of nucleotide and
diffraction data were collected to 2.6 Å (Table 1). Our
crystal structure shows apo-hIRE1 is a symmetrical
dimer in a back-to-back conformation (Figure 1A)
similar to the structure of phosphorylated yIRE1 (Figure
1B), and distinct from the face-to-face dimer previously
observed in ADP-bound hIRE (Figure 1C). While the
unphosphorylated activation loop is not observed in our
structure, the kinase active site has features associated
with a functional kinase: the conserved Lys-Glu salt bridge
between Lys599 in β3 and Glu612 in αC is formed (Figure
2A); the side chains of Tyr628, Leu616, Phe712 and
His686 form a continuous hydrophobic R-spine, although
the side chain of Phe712 is mis-aligned (Figure 2B); and
the gatekeeper Ile642 packs against the αC-helix [23].
This contrasts with the hIRE1-ADP structure determined
previously that has a markedly different kinase active site
in which the side chain of Tyr628 from β4 points down
into the active site, forming hydrogen bonds to the DFG
motif (Figure 2C) [22]. The intrusion of the aromatic
side chain into the active site physically separates the
gatekeeper Ile642 from the αC-helix. As previously noted
[24], this rearrangement breaks the R-spine; Leu616 and
Tyr628 are side-by-side rather than forming the continuous
hydrophobic spine (Figure 2D). Furthermore the Lys-Glu
salt bridge cannot form as the αC-helix is translated along
its axis which, in combination with unwinding by a full
helical turn, displaces equivalent Cα atoms by ≈7.5 Å
between the two structures (Figure 3). The kinase active
site of the hIRE1-ADP complex is not in a functionally
active conformation, and the structure is similar to the
autoinhibitory conformation that was first observed in the
mitotic Ser/Thr kinase Nek7 where the equivalent tyrosine

and it could no longer auto-phosphorylate illustrating
that IRE1 is more sensitive to amino acid perturbations
at this position than Nek7. However, Tyr628Phe was
stable and had greater autophosphorylation activity
than wild-type IRE1 (Figure 4A) [29]. This result
supports our interpretation of the hIRE1-ADP structure
as representing an autoinhibited, inactive state of the
protein. The hydrogen bonds that stabilize Tyr-down
cannot be formed by the phenylalanine side chain in the
Tyr628Phe mutant, and the autoinhibitory conformation is

destabilized, leading to an enhanced rate of autoactivation.
The physiological activation mechanism of IRE1 must
involve a rearrangement of the active site that moves the
side chain of Tyr628 from its buried position as found in
the hIRE1-ADP structure, to the surface-exposed position
present in the apo-hIRE1 structure. It has been previously
hypothesized that the non-productive position of the αChelix in human and mouse IRE1 structures region may
prohibit back-to-back dimer formation [24]. Back-to-back
dimer formation requires changes in the region spanning

the C-terminal end of αC-helix and the N-terminal end
of strand β4, which might be coupled to conformational
changes in Tyr628 (Figure 4B).
We compared the activities of WT and Tyr628Phe
mutant IRE1 in two further biochemical assays that
measured peptide substrate phosphorylation and RNase
activity (Figure S1B, C). In contrast to the results of the
autophosphorylation assay, the two variants of IRE1 were
indistinguishable in the peptide activity assay (Figure
S1B). This may have been due to technical reasons, such as
the different experimental conditions that were required for
this assays or may reflect a genuine disconnection between
the kinetics of IRE1 autophosphorylation and peptide
substrate phosphorylation. In the RNase assay, double
the concentration of WT IRE1 was required to obtain the
same signal as for Tyr628Phe, and the mutant thus appears
to have a higher specific activity (Figure S1C). This is
consistent with more rapid autophosphorylation of the
Tyr628Phe, although differences between the experimental
conditions of the RNase and autophosphorylation assays
preclude a direct comparison of the kinetics of these two
activities.

In yIRE1, with the activation loop phosphorylated, there
are fewer interactions in the N-lobe and those which are
made are between different residues even though the
residues are identical or similar (Figure 6C, S4). For
example, in apo-hIRE1 Arg594 forms an ion pair with
Asp620 and a hydrogen bond to Tyr628 carbonyl while
the equivalent residue in yIRE1 (Arg697) is displaced
and can no longer form the salt-bridge (Figure 6A, 6C).
The secondary structure elements are displaced and
are coupled to a rotation at the dimer interface (Figure
5D, 6B) that disengages the RNase domains of the two
monomers, relative to the positions observed in the phosyIRE1 structure.
Another difference between phos-yIRE1 and
apo-hIRE1 back-to-back dimers is the presence of an
additional α-helix (termed αEʹ in yIRE1 [20]) between β7
and β8 in the kinase C-lobe in the phos-yIRE1 structure
(Figure S3C, D). This contributes substantially to the
interface of the yIRE1 back-to-back dimer, but only
contributes 2 hydrogen bonds over the equivalent loop
region in human IRE1. Twisting of the hIRE1 back-toback dimer interface to more closely resemble the yIRE1
interface would probably increase the number of contacts,
but there is no scope for the contacts to contribute as much
as in the yIRE1 structure.

Comparison of human and yeast IRE1 back-toback dimers

The structure of hIRE1 bound to a kinase
inhibitor/RNase activator

Perhaps the most striking difference between the
human and yeast IRE1 back-to-back dimer structures is the
relatively weak engagement of the RNase domains within
the unphosphorylated human dimer. The RNase domains
of yIRE1 exhibit extensive contacts at the dimer interface,
burying 703 Å2 of surface area [18, 20, 21]. However,
in the apo-hIRE1 structure there is a large void between
the RNase domains and only 227 Å2 is buried (Figure
5A, 5B). The difference at the RNase domain interface
is not caused by large-scale intramolecular motion as the
monomers in the apo-hIRE1 structure are almost identical
to those of yIRE1 (Cα RMSD = 1.17 Å). However, the
overall fit for the dimers is poorer (Cα RMSD = 3.79 Å)
so the differences observed at the RNase interface must be
caused by distinct relative orientations between protomers
(Figure 5C, 5D). In the structures of yIRE1, the monomers
are approximately parallel. However, in the apo-IRE1
structure there is a rotation of approximately 13° between
protomers pivoting about a fulcrum at the interface in the
N-lobe (Figure 5D, S2). The rotation keeps the N-lobes
in close contact but leads to a ~ 10 Å displacement of
residues within the RNase domain core.
The contacts between monomers at the apo-hIRE1
dimer interface are symmetrical and mainly within
the N-lobe. An extensive network of salt bridges and
hydrogen bonds is formed between an acidic region at
the C-terminal end of αC and β4 on one protomer and a
basic protrusion formed by the β(-1)-β0 and β2-β3 loops
on the opposing monomer (Figure 6A, 6B, S3A, S3B).

We developed a series of hIRE1 kinase inhibitors
based on a 4-(imidazo [1,2-b]pyridazin-3-yl)benzamide
scaffold using microwave-assisted reactions (Figure
7A, 7B, S5) [29, 30]. Among these compounds was the
sub-micromolar hIRE1 kinase inhibitor 3. Compound
3 was assessed for the ability to inhibit or enhance the
endoribonuclease function of hIRE1 (Figure 7C, 7D).
This assay clearly showed that compound 3 enhanced the
endoribonuclease activity of unphosphorylated hIRE1 in
vitro with potency (EC50 143 nM), similar to the inhibition
of the kinase autophosphorylation activity (IC50 218 nM).
The compound (3) was soaked into apo-hIRE1
crystals and the structure of the complex was determined
to 2.9Å. The difference electron density due to the
compound 3 was clear and the ligand was modeled in a
single position and in an unambiguous orientation (Figure
8A). The active site is closed up around the ligand and
Van der Waal contacts are made with almost all of its
atoms (Figure 8B, 8C). The ligand has a classical binding
mode, forming a single H-bond with the kinase hinge
region between the imidazole N-1 atom and the main
chain NH of Cys645 (Figure 8C, 8D). The isopropylamino
group is sandwiched between Gly578 (P-loop), Thr648/
Glu651 (αD helix) and His692. The methoxybenzamide
moiety extends towards the hIRE1 DFG motif, and the
amide group forms a network of interactions with the side

chain of Asp711 (DFG), Lys599 and Glu612 (Lys-Glu salt
bridge), and a buried water molecule.
Comparison of the apo and ligand-bound hIRE1
structures shows that most of the active site residues can
be superimposed (Figure 9A). However, there are clear
differences between the positions of the DFG motif and
the Lys-Glu salt bridge. The position of the Asp711 side
chain in the apo-hIRE1 structure is incompatible with
inhibitor binding and this residue moves to accommodate
the ligand (Figure 9B). Furthermore the orientation of
Phe712 side chain has altered such that the R-spine is fully
intact. The activation loop is well defined from 711-726
and 732 onwards in the ligand-bound structure, whereas
residues 713-731 are unresolved in the apo structure. This
may partly be explained by the presence of a sulfate ion in

the vicinity of Arg687 (HRD motif) and Arg611 (αC-helix)
that may help to organize the activation loop by mimicking
the phosphorylation of the activation loop (Figure 9C).

Discussion
IRE1 has been captured in crystal structures that
might represent steps along the activation pathway
(Figure 10). States of no or low RNase activity exhibit
crystal structures in which the kinase domains have
inactive conformations characterized by one or more of
the following features: broken R-spine, distorted αC-helix
and disordered activation loops (Figure 10A, 10B, 10C).
States of high RNase activity exhibit crystal structures

in which the kinase domain has an active conformation
(Figure 10D, 10E). It is debatable whether the present
back-to-back dimer structure represents the RNase active
state which, using the yeast protein as a model, most
likely requires phosphorylation and multimerisation
[18]. This final state of the human protein has thus far
eluded attempts at crystallization, but it may succumb
to a sustained attack using a combination of carefully
controlled protein phosphorylation protocols and cocrystallization using ligands that enhance RNase activity.

of phos-yIRE1 are parallel. In support of the notion that
this observation could represent an important intermediate
in the activation process of hIRE1, each of the two crystal
forms has two hIRE1 molecules in the asymmetric unit that
have different packing arrangements. Autophosphorylation
increases the RNase activity of IRE1 cytoplasmic region,
even when constitutively dimerised [31]. The twist in
apo-hIRE1 disengages the RNase domains, which might
reflect lower RNase activity. However, the significance
of the relative orientation of back-to-back interfaces
between hIRE1 and yIRE1 is presently unclear. Indeed,
there are several differences between the structures that
might explain the twisted interface in the hIRE1 structure:
the absence of phosphorylation on the activation loop,
differences in crystal packing, lack of ligand occupancy in
the kinase active site, or differences between the primary
sequences. Recent structures of the IRE1 homologue
RNase L revealed a greater angle between protomers
than we have seen for apo-hIRE1 while maintaining an
RNase active conformation of RNase L [32, 33]. RNase
L has a C-terminal pseudokinase/ribonuclease domain
homologous to IRE1 however it has a N-terminal
ankyrin repeat domain which differs from IRE1. RNase
L dimerization is driven by binding a small molecule

repeat domain and the N-lobe. Although there is a large

Conservation of IRE1 back-to-back dimerization
in yeast and humans
The structure of apo human IRE1 confirms that the
human protein can adopt a back-to-back conformation
previously only seen in the yeast protein, consistent with
previous experiments showing that point mutations in the
back-to-back interface are required for RNase activity
in the highly similar murine protein [24]. From this
we conclude that hIRE1 can form an RNase active site
similar to yIRE1, and that there is a conserved activation
mechanism that couples IRE1 kinase and RNase activities.
Our structures of hIRE1 revealed that the protomers were
twisted with respect to each other whereas the protomers

domains in RNase L are well engaged and form a wellordered RNase active site. To accommodate the twist
between protomers, the N-lobes are shifted compared to
the IRE1 structures but still make intermolecular contacts.
The RNase L dimer is further stabilized by an extensive

Kinase active site ligands that enhance or inhibit
IRE1 RNase
The IRE1-XBP1 pathway has emerged as a
promising target in multiple myeloma and triple negative
breast cancers amongst other diseases [11, 16]. Structurebased drug-design programs can exploit unliganded hIRE1
crystal forms to advance therapeutic progress, although a
key challenge will be to develop compounds that potently
inhibit kinase activity without stimulating XBP1 splicing.
In this present study, we have shown that the IRE1 kinase
inhibitor imidazopyridazine compound 3 binds to the
ATP binding site, stabilizes an active conformation of the
kinase, including an intact R-spine, and is an enhancer
of RNase activity. This data supports the hypothesis that
IRE1 kinase inhibitors that stimulate the RNase activity
of human IRE1, such as compound 3 and APY29, act
through stabilization of an active conformation of the
kinase active site [12, 24]. In contrast, a kinase inhibitor
that also inhibits RNase activity displaces key active site
residues, disrupts the R-spine and distorts the αC-helix
(Figure 10A) [26]. Type II inhibitors, widely studied in
other kinases, displace the DFG motif, thus disrupting
the R-spine, and although structural data have not been
reported, an exemplar of this class of IRE1 kinase inhibitor
has demonstrated RNase inhibition [12]. Furthermore,
ADP has been described as an IRE1 RNase inhibitor and
the autoinhibitory Tyr-down conformation in the ADPbound hIRE1 structure also disrupts the R-spine and
Figure 10: Graphical summary of IRE1 structures.

A. hIRE1 crystallizes as a monomer in the complex with
a sulfonamide inhibitor (PDB code 4U6R). The R-spine is
disrupted by a chlorophenyl group that pushes the αC-helix out
of position. B. ADP-hIRE1 crystallizes as a face-to-face dimer
(PDB code 3P23). The monomers are in a conformation in which
autophosphorylation is inhibited. The down position of Tyr628
breaks the R-spine, and αC-helix is rotated away from the N-lobe
to generate a surface that cannot form the back-to-back dimer.
C. apo-hIRE1 crystallizes as a back-to-back dimer. Tyr628 is
in the up position, the αC-helix is in an active position, but the
R-spine is not fully formed. D. The structure of hIRE in complex
with a kinase inhibitor that stimulates RNase activity (I) has a
more ordered activation loop and a fully-formed R-spine. E.
phospho-yIRE1 crystallizes as a back-to-back dimer in which the
activation loop is fully ordered, and the R-spine is intact (PDB
code 3FBV). Full RNase activity depends on multimerisation of
yIRE1 protomers (not shown).

Proteins were eluted in 20 mL 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM
HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol and 250 mM imidazole.
0.04 U/pmol of λ-phosphatase (NEB) and 300 µg of GST
tagged-rhinovirus 3C protease were added to purified
proteins which were then dialyzed against 200 mM NaCl
and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) overnight at 4°C. The ionic
strength of the sample was reduced by dilution with 50
mM HEPES (pH 7.5) to obtain a final concentration of
NaCl ≈ 40 mM. The sample was filtered through a 0.45
µm filter before application to a 5 mL Q-HP Trap (GE
Healthcare) and was purified on a gradient to 1 M NaCl
and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5). As a final purification step,
proteins were purified by size exclusion chromatography
on a 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 200
mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA and 5

Purification of IRE1 mutants followed a similar
protocol. Cells were lysed by sonication in 200 mM NaCl,
50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2 and
1 EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Samples
were clarified at 45,000g for 40 min at 4°C. Proteins were
passed through 0.45 µm filter applied to a 1 mL StrepTrap
(GE Healthcare), washed with 10 mL 200 mM NaCl and
50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and eluted in 200 mM NaCl,
50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. Tag
removal and protein dephosphorylation was performed
as above. 3C protease was removed by flowing the

concentrators (Vivaspin) prior to freezing in liquid N2 and
storage at -80°C.

Kinase autoinhibition through a Tyr residue on
strand β4
The autoinhibitory mechanism present in IRE1 is
mediated by a tyrosine residue at the N-terminus of β4,
which is present in approximately 10% of the human
kinome. An equivalent mechanism was first identified in
Nek7, a kinase that can be activated by an upstream kinase
or by autophosphorylation through an intermolecular
mechanism [27, 34]. In both cases, the mechanism serves
to prevent untimely self-activation. Further work will be
required to identify which other kinases are regulated
through a similar autoinhibitory conformation, and
whether formation of a back-to-back dimer provides a
general mechanism for release of the tyrosine, leading to
kinase activation.

Materials and Methods
Cloning and protein production
Large scale production of wt hIRE1 was performed
as in Ref. [29]. Briefly, hIRE1 residues Gly547-Leu977
was cloned into a modified version of pFastBac which
contains an N-terminal 6-His tag followed by a rhinovirus
3C protease site. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were
grown to a cell density of 2 × 106 cell/mL and infected
with ~50 µL of virus per 107 cells. Cultures were harvested
after 3 days.
To create hIRE1 mutants, the same IRE1 fragment
was subcloned into a modified version of pMAX (Lonza)
providing an N-terminal tandem Strep2 tag, FLAG tag
and rhinovirus 3C protease site. Mutants were created by
the Quikchange method (Stratagene). Hek293 suspension
cells were transfected at 106 cell/mL with 0.5 µg DNA per
mL and 2 µg/mL polyethyleneamine. Cells were harvested
48hrs after transfection.

Protein crystallization and crystallography
Apo-hIRE1 was crystallized by hanging-drop vapor
diffusion by mixing IRE1 (at 2 mg/mL) with reservoir
solution containing 18-20% PEG3350, 0.2 M sodium
malonate and 0.1 Bis-Trispropane (pH 6.5) in a 1:1 ratio.
Crystallization experiments were conducted at 18°C.
Crystals also grew if sodium malonate was replaced
with sodium sulfate, or K/Na tartrate. Single crystals
grew more reproducibly when crystallization drops were
micro-seeded using a cat whisker, otherwise crystals
grew in joined clusters. Crystals were briefly (≈30 sec)
soaked in 22% PEG3350, 0.2 M Na Malonate, 0.1 M
Bis-Trispropane (pH 7.5) and 25% ethylene glycol before
plunging into liquid N2.
To prepare crystals for compound soaking, hIRE1apo crystals were grown in 20% PEG 3350, 0.2M
NaSO4, 0.1 M Bis-Trispropane (pH 6.5). A single crystal
was transferred to solution supplemented with 0.1 mM
compound 3 for 20 hours, briefly soaked in the same

Protein purification
His-hIRE1 cell pellet was resuspended in 4 volumes
of 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol,
1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 80 U/mL DNase I and 1
EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Cells were
lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation at
45,000g for 40 min at 4°C followed by sequential filtration
through 1.2 µm and 0.45 µm filters before application to
10 mL TALON resin (Clontech). IRE1 was purified using
gravity flow. The column was washed 3 times with 5

buffer supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol, and then
flash cooled in liquid N2.
X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K
from single cryo-cooled hIRE1 crystals at Beamline
I04-1 at DIAMOND Lightsource. Diffraction data
were integrated using the XDS software package [35],
and scaled and merged using AIMLESS [36] within
CCP4 [37]. The structure of apo-hIRE1 was solved by
molecular replacement using Phaser 2.1 [38] with a single
protomer from the ADP-hIRE1 crystal structure (PDB ID
3P23) [22]. The ligand-bound structure was solved by
molecular replacement, using apo-hIRE1 as the model.
Manual model building was performed in COOT [39]
and refinement was performed in Buster 2.1 with NCS
restraints [40, 41].

Endoribonuclease assay
IRE1 endoribonuclease activity was measured
using a FRET derepression assay monitoring cleavage
of a 29-nucleotide stem-loop RNA containing the XBP1
cleavage site sequence and labelled with a fluorescence
emitter (FAM) and a fluorescence quencher (BHQ) at
the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively [29] (Figure 7C). Upon
cleavage of the stem-loop, dissociation of the product
strands leads to derepression of the FRET between emitter
and quencher, and signal is recovered. Briefly, varying
volumes of compound in DMSO or DMSO alone were
added to a low volume 384 well plate (3676, Corning,
USA) to give final concentrations ranging from 100 µM
to 0.313 nM using an Echo acoustic liquid dispenser
(Labcyte, CA., USA). Non-phosphorylated IRE1
G547-L977 was added to a final concentration of 200 nM.
After incubating for 30 minutes at 30o C, hairpin RNA
XBP-1 substrate mimic labelled with fluorescein and Black
Hole quencher (5′ FAM-GAACAAGAUAUCCGCAGCAUAUACAGUUC-3′ BHQ, Eurofins MWG Operon,
Germany) was added to 100 nM final concentration. After
incubating for a further 15 minutes at 30°C, the fluorescein
fluorescence was measured on an EnVision plate reader
(Perkin-Elmer, MA., USA). Fluorescence in the presence
of compound was expressed relative to that of DMSO
alone (no compound).

Autophosphorylation assay
IRE1 autophosphorylation activity and compound
inhibition (IC50) was measured using a DissociationEnhanced Lanthanide Fluorescent Immunoassay
(DELFIA) assay as in Ref. [29]. Briefly, dephosphorylated
IRE1 was incubated for 25 min with 100 µM ATP in 15
µL assay buffer (40 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl2 and
1 mM DTT). The assay was stopped by the addition of
40 mM EDTA. Samples were transferred to a 384-well
high-binding plate and incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates
were washed three times in 0.1% Tween-20 followed by
blocking in 5% non-fat skimmed milk in PBS for 30 mins
at 37°C. Plates were washed again before application of
α-pS724 phospho-specific IRE1 primary antibody [29]
(160 pg/mL) in PBS to each well and incubated for 1.5
hour are 37°C. The plates were washed before addition of
a Europium labeled α-rabbit secondary antibody (Perkin
Elmer Life Sciences). Another wash step was followed
by the addition of DELFIA enhancement solution (Perkin
Elmer Life Sciences). Assay plates were read on an
EnVision 2103 microplate reader (Perkin Elmer Life
Sciences).

(0.040-0.063 mm). Analytical thin layer chromatography
(TLC) was performed on pre-coated aluminium sheets
of silica (60 F254, Merck) and visualised by short-wave
UV light and permanganate dip. 1H-Nuclear magnetic
resonance spectra were recorded at 500 MHz on Bruker
AMX500 spectrometers using an internal deuterium
lock. Chemical shifts were measured in parts per million
(ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane (δ = 0) using the
following internal references for residual protons in the
solvent: CD3OD (δH 3.32) and (CD3)2SO (δH 2.50).

Substrate phosphorylation assay
Peptide phosphorylation was measured using the
STK Substrate 2-biotin (Biotinyl-Ahx-RRRLSFAEPGCONH2) substrate from the HTRF KinEASE kit (Cisbio,
MA, USA). Assays were carried out in low volume, black
384-well plates (3676 from Corning Life Sciences, MA),
with a 10 μl assay volume containing 30 μM ATP (Km
= 26 μM), 600 nM STK Substrate 2-biotin and 50 nM
of dephosphosphorylated Ire1. Following incubation at
37°C over the time course, the reaction was stopped with
buffered EDTA, which contained the detection reagents,
streptavidin-XL665 and the STK-antibody labelled
with Eu3+-cryptate. The resulting TR-FRET signal,
