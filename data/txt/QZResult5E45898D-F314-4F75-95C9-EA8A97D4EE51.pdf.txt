ABSTRACT
Anti-cancer agents exert therapeutic effects by damaging DNA. Unfortunately,
DNA polymerases can effectively replicate the formed DNA lesions to cause drug
resistance and create more aggressive cancers. To understand this process at the
cellular level, we developed an artificial nucleoside that visualizes the replication of
damaged DNA to identify cells that acquire drug resistance through this mechanism.
Visualization is achieved using "click" chemistry to covalently attach azide-containing
fluorophores to the ethynyl group present on the nucleoside analog after its
incorporation opposite damaged DNA. Flow cytometry and microscopy techniques
demonstrate that the extent of nucleotide incorporation into genomic DNA is enhanced
by treatment with DNA damaging agents. In addition, this nucleoside analog inhibits
translesion DNA synthesis and synergizes the therapeutic activity of certain anticancer agents such as temozolomide. The combined diagnostic and therapeutic
activities of this synthetic nucleoside analog represent a new paradigm in personalized
medicine.

INTRODUCTION

coupled with the large number of DNA polymerases that
participate in their replication. In humans, for example,
at least seven of the 15 different DNA polymerases can
replicate structurally diverse DNA lesions such as thymine
dimers, abasic sites, and double strand DNA breaks [2–6].
Understanding how TLS activity is regulated at
the cellular level is especially relevant in cancer patients
receiving chemotherapy [7–11]. For example, a significant
complication of TLS is the onset of drug resistance
caused by misreplicating the DNA lesions produced by
agents such as temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin [7–9]
(Figure 1A). Furthermore, the pro-mutagenic outcomes
of TLS can increase the frequency of genetic mutations
and create more aggressive cancers. Indeed, Johnson et al.
recently reported that brain tumors isolated from patients
treated with TMZ became drug resistant as a result of
acquired somatic mutations in genes associated with DNA
mismatch repair [10]. These tumors were hypermutated

Cellular DNA is constantly exposed to a wide
variety of internal and external DNA damaging agents.
While cells possess several pathways to correct damaged
DNA, some lesions unfortunately escape repair and
their presence can produce devastating cellular effects
ranging from mutagenesis and genomic rearrangements
to cell death. One conserved mechanism to tolerate
unrepaired DNA lesions involves their efficient by-pass
in a process termed translesion DNA synthesis (TLS).
Since most high-fidelity DNA polymerases involved in
chromosomal replication cannot efficiently replicate and
bypass damaged DNA, cells rely heavily on the activity
of specialized DNA polymerases to accomplish this task
[1]. A complete understanding of how these polymerases
function at the cellular level has been hindered by
the diversity of DNA lesions that form inside a cell

and contained more than 30 mutations per megabase
whereas initial untreated tumors had significantly lower
mutation frequencies (0.2 to 4.5 mutations per Mb) [10].
Despite the importance of TLS, there are no
chemical compounds that can monitor this process at
the cellular level. We have addressed this problem by
developing nucleotide analogs that are efficiently and
selectively incorporated opposite DNA lesions generated
by DNA damaging agents. One therapeutically important
DNA lesion is the abasic site which is non-enzymatically
formed by DNA alkylating agents such as TMZ and
enzymatically by DNA glycosylases [12]. We developed an
artificial nucleotide designated 3-ethynyl-5-nitroindolyl2’-deoxyriboside triphosphate (3-Eth-5-NITP) (Figure
1B) that functions as an efficient surrogate for the natural
nucleotide, dATP, that is preferentially utilized during TLS
[13]. In this report, we use the corresponding nucleoside,
3-Eth-5-NIdR, to track TLS activity in cancer cells treated
with compounds that generate abasic sites. Visualizing the
replication of these lesions was achieved using coppercatalyzed “click” chemistry to tag the ethynyl moiety
present on the nucleotide with fluorogenic probes. This
represents a new diagnostic technique to quantify drug
resistance caused by TLS activity. In addition, co-treating
leukemia cells with 3-Eth-5-NIdR and anti-cancer agents
that generate abasic sites causes a synergistic increase
in cell death and correlates with the amount of 3-Eth-5NITP incorporated into genomic DNA. Collectively, the
diagnostic and therapeutic activities of this novel artificial
nucleoside provide a new paradigm in personalized
medicine for cancer treatment.

show a 2-fold increase in cell death. More importantly,
cells treated with a low concentration of 3-Eth-5-NIdR (10
µg/mL) and 5 µM UdR show a synergistic increase in cell
death that is 2.5-fold higher than the additive effects of
UdR and 3-Eth-5-NIdR treatment (Figure 2C). The ability
of 3-Eth-5-NIdR to increase the cell killing effects of UdR
likely reflects the ability of the corresponding nucleoside
triphosphate, 3-Eth-5-NITP, to effectively block the
replication of unrepaired abasic sites.
We verified that this synergistic effect is caused
by inhibiting TLS activity using dual parameter flow
cytometry (propidium iodide (PI) and fluorescence
detection of the artificial nucleotide) to measure the
amount of AlexaFluor488 covalently attached to 3-Eth-5NIdR incorporated into genomic DNA. Figure 2D shows
that MOLT4 cells treated with DMSO or 5 µM UdR have
low levels (< 0.5%) of AlexaFluor488 labeled DNA. Cells
treated with 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR for two days display
low but appreciable levels of AlexaFluor488 labeled DNA
(1.1%). This low level is consistent with previous results
demonstrating that 3-Eth-5-NIdR can detect the cellular
activity of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)
which is overexpressed in MOLT4 cells [15]. However,
cells co-treated with 10 µg/mL Eth-5-NIdR and 5 µM UdR
show more robust effects as there is a ~6-fold increase
in AlexaFluor488 labeled DNA (6.4%). The increase
in “clicked” DNA likely occurs by the incorporation of
3-Eth-5-NITP opposite abasic sites formed after uracil
excision. The amount of 3-Eth-5-NIdR utilized during TLS
was compared to the amount of 5-ethynyl-2’deoxyribose
uracil (EdU) incorporated during normal DNA synthesis
(Figure 2D). As expected, cells treated with 10 µM EdU
have considerably higher levels “clicked” genomic DNA
(35.2%) compared to cells treated with UdR and 3-Eth-5NIdR (6.4%). In general, the higher amount of "clicked"
DNA with EdU treatment results from the efficient
insertion of the thymine analog opposite adenine which
occurs with a significantly higher frequency in genomic
DNA compared to unrepaired abasic sites.

RESULTS
Measuring the cellular replication of abasic sites
In order to study the cellular replication of damaged
DNA, it was necessary to generate abasic sites inside cells.
This was achieved by using the enzymatic activity of
uracil DNA glycosylase to produce abasic sites by excising
uracil from DNA (Figure 2A). In these experiments,
MOLT4 leukemia cells were treated with 5 μM uracil
2-deoxyribose (UdR) or DMSO (vehicle control). After
72 hours post-treatment, genomic DNA was isolated and
the number of abasic sites in DNA was quantified using
the aldehyde reactive probe (ARP) assay [14]. Figure 2B
shows that cells treated with 5 µM UdR have a ~4-fold
higher number of abasic sites compared to cells treated
with DMSO.
The viability of MOLT4 cells treated with 5 µM UdR
was also measured using two independent biochemical
assays (visualization by microscopy and flow cytometry).
Figure 2C shows that cells treated with 5 µM UdR have
a ~3-fold higher level of cell death compared to DMSO
treatment. Cells treated with 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR
(which corresponds to a molar concentration of 33 µM)

Specialized DNA polymerases preferentially
insert 3-Eth-5-NITP opposite abasic sites
We next investigated which cellular DNA polymerases
may be responsible for incorporating 3-Eth-5-NITP opposite
abasic sites formed after UdR treatment. In vitro approaches
measured the kinetic parameters, kcat, Km, and kcat/Km, for the
utilization of dATP and 3-Eth-5-NITP by pol δ, the highfidelity polymerase involved in chromosomal replication
and pol η, a specialized DNA polymerase that produces drug
resistance by replicating damaged DNA [16, 17]. MichaelisMenten plots for the utilization of dATP by each polymerase
are provided as Supplementary Figure 1, and the kinetic
parameters derived from these plots are summarized in
Table 1. In this analysis, the most important parameter is the
kcat/Km value as this reflects the overall catalytic efficiency

of the polymerase to utilize a nucleotide substrate under
physiological conditions. These data indicate that pol δ
inserts dATP opposite an abasic site very poorly as the low
kcat/Km value of 5.5 M-1sec-1 is caused by a high Km value for
dATP (560 ± 180 μM) coupled with a low kcat value (0.0031
± 0.0004 sec-1). In contrast, pol η is 500-fold more efficient
at incorporating dATP opposite the lesion. The high kcat/
Km value of 2,600 M-1sec-1 is caused by a 12-fold lower Km
value for dATP coupled with a ~40-fold faster kcat value. The
observed differences in catalytic efficiencies suggest that pol
η is more efficient than pol δ at incorporating dATP opposite
abasic sites and thus likely contributes more to the errorprone replication of this lesion under cellular conditions.
Similar experiments were performed using 3-Eth5-NITP as the substrate (Supplementary Figure 2) and the

resulting kinetic parameters are provided in Table 1. In the
case of pol δ, the kcat/Km value of 6,400 M-1sec-1 for 3-Eth5-NITP is ~1,200-fold higher than dATP while the catalytic
efficiency of ~68,000 M-1sec-1 measured with pol η is ~30fold higher than dATP. Thus, both high- and low-fidelity DNA
polymerases utilize 3-Eth-5-NITP more efficiently than dATP.
However, the higher efficiency observed with pol η suggests
that specialized polymerases are primarily responsible for
utilizing 3-Eth-5-NITP during TLS. Note that exonuclease
proofreading activity with this particular nucleotide is
extraordinarily low. Thus, the kinetic parameters measured
here are not complicated by idle turnover activity and represent
an accurate measurement of nucleotide incorporation.
We next examined the ability of both high-fidelity
and specialized DNA polymerases to extend beyond

Figure 2: (A) Strategy for generating abasic sites under cellular conditions by using uracil DNA glycosylase to excise uracil from DNA
in cells treated with UdR. (B) Exposure to uracil 2-deoxyribose increases the number of abasic sites in MOLT4 cells. MOLT4 cells were
used at an initial density of 200,000 cells/mL and treated with 5 µM uracil 2-deoxyribose (UdR) or DMSO (vehicle control). After 72
hours post-treatment, genomic DNA was isolated, quantified, and diluted in TE buffer to a final concentration of 100 μg/μl. The number of
abasic sites in DNA was quantified using the aldehyde reactive probe (ARP) assay. All assays were performed in triplicate, and the means
were calculated. Data were calculated on the basis of a linear calibration curve with ARP-DNA standard solution and expressed as number
of apurinic sites per 100,000 nucleotides. (C) Combining 3-Eth-5-NIdR with UdR generates a synergistic cytotoxic effect compared to
treatment with either UdR or 3-Eth-5-NIdR alone. In all cases, the initial density of MOLT4 leukemia cells was maintained at 200,000
cells/mL prior to treatment. Cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO (vehicle), 5 µM UdR, 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR, and 5 µM UdR with
10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR for 72 hours. At this time interval, cell viability was assessed using trypan blue staining to count the number
of viable versus non-viable cells using a hemocytometer. Cell viability was also assessed with a Muse Cell Count (EMD Millipore).
Both assays yield results that are identical within experimental error to each other. (D) MOLT4 cells treated with DMSO or 5 µM UdR
have low levels (< 0.5%) of AlexaFluor488 labeled DNA while cells treated with 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR have slightly higher levels of
AlexaFluor488 labeled DNA (1.1%). Co-treatment with 10 µg/mL Eth-5-NIdR and 5 µM UdR results in a 6-fold increase in AlexaFluor488
labeled DNA (6.4%). Treatment with 10 µM EdU generates considerably higher levels “clicked” genomic DNA (35.2%).

dAMP or 3-Eth-5-NIMP paired opposite an abasic site.
Both mispairs were formed in situ by adding a fixed
concentration of nucleotide substrate was added to a
solution containing DNA substrate pre-incubated with
DNA polymerase. After 4 half-lives, an aliquot of dTTP
and dGTP (500 µM final concentration) was added to
initiate the elongation reaction. Supplementary Figure
3 provides gel electrophoresis data demonstrating that
high-fidelity DNA polymerases such as pol δ and the
bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase efficiently insert
3-Eth-5-NITP opposite an abasic site but are unable to
elongate beyond the artificial nucleotide when supplied
with natural dNTPs. These results validate the chain
termination capabilities of this artificial nucleotide.
Results obtained using pol η (provided as
Supplementary Figure 4) are more complicated as the
specialized DNA polymerase shows a unique ability to
elongate one nucleotide beyond 3-Eth-5-NIMP when
paired opposite an abasic site. Although pol η can elongate
one base beyond the lesion, it is unable to continue primer
elongation when supplied with high concentrations
(> 500 µM) of natural dNTPs. Similar behavior is
observed when pol η is supplied with dATP. In this
case, the specialized DNA polymerase incorporates the
artificial nucleotide opposite the lesion and also extends
one nucleotide beyond the abasic site. However, pol η
possesses significantly higher activity toward elongating
beyond dAMP when supplied with natural dNTPs. This
activity contrast data obtained with 3-Eth-NIMP which
hinders extension beyond the DNA lesion. These results
validate that the synthetic analog is a chain terminator of
TLS whereas lesion by-pass can more easily occur with
natural nucleotides. Collectively, these data validate that
the artificial nucleotide analog likely induces cell death by
inhibiting the by-pass of abasic sites catalyzed by either
high-fidelity or specialized DNA polymerases.

synergistic effects caused by combining 3-Eth-5-NIdR
with TMZ. As illustrated, combining 3-Eth-5-NIdR with
TMZ produces a synergistic increase in cell death (27.5%)
compared to the additive effects of 11.9% from cells
treated individually with 100 µM TMZ (7.5%) or 10 µg/
mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR (4.4%).
To verify that this synergistic effect reflects the
inhibition of TLS activity, we quantified the number
of abasic sites produced by TMZ treatment using the
aldehyde reactive probe (ARP) assay [14]. As illustrated in
Figure 3C, MOLT4 cells treated with 100 µM TMZ have
a 15% increase in the number of abasic sites compared
to DMSO treatment. The number of abasic sites formed
with 3-Eth-5-NIdR with treatment is identical, within
experimental error, to the number of abasic sites produced
using DMSO. For convenience, this data point has been
omitted from Figure 3C. More importantly, however,
we observe that combining 3-Eth-5-NIdR with TMZ
produces a 35% increase in the number of abasic sites.
This increase could result from two interrelated effects.
First, incorporation of 3-Eth-5-NITP opposite an abasic
site inhibits the ability of a DNA polymerase to extend
beyond the lesion. Secondly, the incorporation of 3-Eth5-NITP may hinder the efficient repair of abasic sites
formed by TMZ treatment. Note that this inhibition does
not immediately cause cell death as cells likely attempt
to repair stalled replication forks before undergoing
apoptosis. Regardless, the combined effects of the
inhibition of DNA repair and TLS activity is consistent
with the synergistic cell-killing effects caused by
combining 3-Eth-5-NIdR with TMZ.
We also tested the ability of 3-Eth-5-NIdR to
potentiate the cell killing effects of other anti-cancer drugs
such as cisplatin, chlorambucil, carmustine, doxorubicin,
and hydroxyurea. These agents were chosen as they
produce DNA lesions that are structurally distinct from
abasic sites [19–23]. Data provided in Supplementary
Table 1 shows that co-treatment with 10 µg/mL 3-Eth5-NIdR does not increase the cell killing effects of
anti-cancer agents that form DNA crosslinks (cisplatin,
chlorambucil, and carmustine) or single-strand DNA
(hydroxyurea). However, treatment with a sub-lethal
concentration of 3-Eth-5-NIdR increases the cytotoxic
effects of doxorubicin by 2-fold, and this could reflect
the ability of 3-Eth-5-NITP to inhibit the ability of TdT to
replicate DSBs formed by doxorubicin [15]. Collectively,
these data coupled with the inability of 3-Eth-5-NIdR to
potentiate the cytotoxic effects of crosslinked or alkylated
DNA lesions indicate that the artificial nucleoside
selectively inhibits TLS activity against non-instructional
DNA lesions. i.e., abasic sites and DSBs.

Measuring translesion DNA synthesis activity in
response to chemotherapeutic agents
We next assessed the ability of 3-Eth-5-NIdR
to potentiate the cell killing effects of TMZ, an anticancer agent that generates abasic sites via alkylation
of the N7-position of guanine [18]. Cell viability
was directly compared in cells treated with DMSO,
100 µM TMZ, 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR, and 100 µM TMZ
combined with 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR. Figure 3A shows
that treatment with either TMZ or 3-Eth-5-NIdR alone
for three days produces weak cytostatic and cytotoxic
effects. However, more significant effects are observed
when TMZ is combined with a sub-lethal dose of 3-Eth5-NIdR as the number of viable cells decreases with a
concomitant increase in the number of non-viable cells.
The data provided in Figure 3B normalizes the percentage
of non-viable cells as a function of drug exposure against
treatment with DMSO to more easily visualize the

5-NIdR with TMZ were interrogated using PI uptake and
annexin V staining to distinguish live cells from those
undergoing early and late stage apoptosis or necrosis.
Representative data provided in Figure 3D show that
MOLT4 cells co-treated with 3-Eth-5-NIdR and TMZ
have significantly higher levels of early and late stage
apoptosis (15.9% and 22.9%, respectively) compared to
cells treated with TMZ (8.5% and 10.1%, respectively)
or 3-Eth-5-NIdR (6.9% and 7.3%, respectively). Values
provided in Table 2 represent an average of three
independent determinations and are normalized for the
effects of DMSO used as the co-solvent. As indicated,
the net apoptotic effect (Δ = 28.7%) for combining 3-Eth5-NIdR with TMZ is 1.6-fold greater than the additive
effects of TMZ or 3-Eth-5-NIdR treatment (Δ = 18.2%).
The effect of this drug combination on cell cycle
progression was next examined using PI staining to
measure cellular DNA content. Representative histograms
are provided in Figure 3E and a summary of three
independent determinations are provided in Table 3.
A baseline in cell-cycle progression was established by
first examining cells treated with DMSO. The histogram
displays a pattern consistent with an asynchronous cell
population as the majority of cells exist at G0/G1 (40.0 ±
3.2%) with smaller populations at S-phase (27.1 ± 2.5%),
G2/M (25.0 ± 3.1%), and sub-G1 (7.9 ± 1.4%). Treatment
with 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR over a three day period
produces a similar profile (G0/G1 = 40.8 ± 3.9%, S-phase
= 23.1 ± 3.2%, G2/M =21.5 ± 2.1%, and sub-G1= 14.6
± 1.9%). Treatment with 100 µM TMZ also generates a
negligible effect on the population of cells at G0/G1 (41.0
± 4.1%). However, treatment with the DNA damaging
agent produces small reductions in cell populations
corresponding to S-phase (19.8 ± 1.5%) and G2/M (21.4
± 2.4%) that occur concomitant with an increase in sub-G1
cells (17.8 ± 2.5%). This increase is consistent with the
induction of apoptosis caused by DNA damage after TMZ
treatment. More importantly, combining 3-Eth-5-NIdR
with TMZ produces higher levels in sub-G1 DNA (30.9
± 2.9%). This effect appears cell cycle independent as it
occurs concomitant with decreases in cell populations at
every stage of the cell cycle (G0/G1 = 34.8 ± 2.5%, S-phase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

= 18.9 ± 1.9%, and G2M = 15.4 ± 1.5%). The synergistic
increase in sub-G1 DNA again suggests that inhibiting
lesion by-pass and/or the timely repair of lesions produced
by TMZ increases apoptosis.

Using “Click” chemistry to visualize translesion
DNA synthesis
To verify that 3-Eth-5-NIdR inhibits TLS activity,
high-field microscopy techniques were used to visualize
the nucleoside in cellular DNA using “click” chemistry
to covalently attach fluorogenic probes to the nucleotide
incorporated into DNA. Microscopy images provided in
Figure 4A show that MOLT4 cells treated with DMSO
show insignificant levels of green fluorescence. This
negative result is expected since this compound does
not contain an alkyne moiety that can react with the
azide-containing fluorophore. Cells treated with 10 µg/
mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR consistently display slightly elevated
levels of green fluorescence. The merged image of green
fluorescence with DAPI staining shows nuclear colocalization of the AlexaFluor488 label, indicating that
3-Eth-5-NIdR is incorporated into genomic DNA even in
the absence of exogenous DNA damage. However, cells
co-treated with 100 µM TMZ and 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR
show significantly higher levels of green fluorescence
which again co-localizes in the nucleus (panel D).
Confocal microscopy images provided as Supplementary
Figure 5 validate that the green fluorescence emanating
from the “clicked” nucleoside co-localizes within the
nucleus. The increased incorporation of 3-Eth-5-NITP into
genomic DNA coincides with a higher number of abasic
sites produced by TMZ treatment and this provides direct
visual evidence for the replication of these DNA lesions
inside cells.
We next compared the extent of 3-Eth-5-NITP
incorporation during TLS to cells treated with variable
concentrations of EdU (0.05 to 5 µM). Images provided
in Figure 4B show that the fluorescence signal caused by
EdU incorporation increases as the concentration of EdU
is raised from 0.05 to 1 µM. Above a concentration of
1 µM, the level of fluorescence appears to plateau, and

3-Eth-5-NIdR with TMZ produces a 27.5% increase in the percentage of non-viable cells compared to increases of 7.5% and 4.4% with
100 µM TMZ or 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR, respectively. Thus, the combination of 3-Eth-5-NIdR with TMZ generates a synergistic increase
in apoptosis as it is greater than the predicted additive effects. *** represents a p value of > 0.001 (C) Combining 3-Eth-5-NIdR with TMZ

quantified, and diluted in TE buffer to a final concentration of 100 μg/μl. The number of abasic sites in DNA was quantified using the

basis of a linear calibration curve with ARP-DNA standard solution and expressed as number of apurinic sites per 100,000 nucleotides.

this may reflect saturation kinetics in the uptake of EdU
and/or its metabolism to the corresponding nucleoside
triphosphate [24, 25]. Regardless, microscopy images
provided in Figure 4A show that cells treated with 3-Eth-5NIdR and TMZ display fluorescence levels that are similar
to cells treated with 0.5 µM EdU. This conclusion was
verified by quantifying the amount of fluorescently labeled
DNA isolated from cells treated with 3-Eth-5-NIdR and
TMZ and comparing it to DNA isolated from cells treated
with variable concentrations of EdU (0.05–5 µM). Figure
4C provides a standard curve showing an excellent linear
correlation (r2 = 0.98) in fluorescence signal as a function
of increasing EdU concentrations (from 0.01 to 1 µM).
This standard curve was used to determine that DNA
isolated from cells treated with TMZ and 3-Eth-5-NIdR
displays a level of fluorescence that is comparable to DNA
isolated from cells treated with 0.5 µM EdU. Collectively,
the results from the microscopy analyses coupled with
quantitation of purified DNA from cells verify that 3-Eth5-NIdR is incorporated opposite DNA lesions generated
by TMZ treatment.

damaged DNA, the development of a diagnostic assay
to predict how TLS activity affects therapeutic responses
to anti-cancer agents, and a new therapeutic strategy to
improve the efficacy of DNA damaging agents used in
chemotherapy. Each area is discussed in more detail
below.
Currently, there are two accepted models for how
DNA polymerase activity is coordinated during TLS
[26, 27]. In the first model, a high-fidelity DNA
polymerase such as pol δ encounters an unrepaired DNA
lesion during chromosomal replication. After incorporating
a nucleotide opposite the lesion, the polymerase is unable
to extend beyond it. Subsequent stalling of the replication
fork the recruits a specialized DNA polymerase such as
pol κ or pol ζ to extend beyond the lesion. Once lesion
by-pass occurs, pol δ displaces the specialized polymerase
and resumes DNA synthesis downstream of the damaged
DNA. The second model varies slightly as the intrinsic
high-fidelity of pol δ prevents it from incorporating a
nucleotide opposite the lesion. Instead, a specialized DNA
polymerase such as pol η is recruited to incorporate a
dNTP opposite the lesion. After pol η by-passes the lesion,
pol δ replaces the specialized polymerase and continues
chromosomal replication. In general, the in vitro kinetic
data provided here are consistent with this second model as
pol δ displays low TLS activity as evident in a remarkably
low catalytic efficiency for incorporating dATP opposite
an abasic site. In contrast, pol η is far more proficient at
incorporating dATP and 3-Eth-5-NITP opposite the noninstructional DNA lesion. More importantly, pol η utilizes
3-Eth-5-NITP ~10-fold more efficiently than dATP. This
higher efficiency coupled with the chain-termination
capabilities of the artificial nucleotide suggests that 3-Eth5-NITP preferentially inhibits TLS catalyzed by pol η. The
inhibitory effects against this specialized DNA polymerase
explains how 3-Eth-5-NIdR increases the cytotoxic effects
of compounds such as UdR and TMZ that create noninstructional DNA lesions such as abasic sites.
Expanding on these results, we applied “click”
chemistry to selectively and covalently attach fluorogenic
probes to 3-Eth-5-NIdR to visualize the cellular activity of

DISCUSSION
TLS is an important biological pathway that provides
cells with an effective way to survive genomic stress
caused by unrepaired DNA lesions. Unfortunately, this
process can also produce detrimental effects at the cellular
and organismal levels. Indeed, unregulated TLS activity
is involved in the initiation and progression of diseases
such as cancer as well as in generating drug resistance
to therapeutic agents used to treat this disease. Despite
the importance of TLS, a complete understanding of this
process has been hindered by the lack of biochemical
tools that can directly measure the replication of damaged
DNA inside cells. This report addresses this deficiency
by using an artificial nucleoside to quantify TLS activity
in cells treated with DNA damaging agents. Our results
provide key insights into three fundamentally important
areas. These include defining the roles of high-fidelity
and low fidelity DNA polymerases toward replicating

Figure 4:  (A) Microscopy analyses monitoring the incorporation of 3-Eth-5-NIdR opposite abasic sites generated by TMZ treatment.

Cells were co-treated with 100 µM TMZ, 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR, and a combination of 100 µM TMZ and 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR for
three days. Cells treated with a combination of 100 µM TMZ and 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR display significantly higher levels of green
fluorescence that co-localizes in the nucleus compared to cells treated with 100 µM TMZ or 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR alone. (B) Microscopy
images of MOLT4 cells treated with increasing concentrations of EdU (0.05 to 5 µM). The fluorescence signal reflecting EdU incorporation
increases as the concentration of EdU is raised from 0.05 to 1 µM. See text for experimental details. (C) The standard curve for the
fluorescence of DNA “clicked” with EdU versus the concentration of EdU is linear (r2 = 0.98). DNA isolated from MOLT4 cells treated
with 3-Eth-5-NIdR and TMZ (■) shows a level of fluorescence comparable to 0.5 µM EdU. See text for experimental details regarding the
generation of the standard curve used to determine the amount of 3-Eth-5-NITP incorporated into genomic DNA.

pol η during TLS. This has important clinical applications,
particularly with respect to developing diagnostic tests
to determine patient responses to anti-cancer agents
that damage DNA. Accurately measuring the effects of
chemotherapeutic agents has obvious implications for
facilitating successful patient responses to drug treatment.
This is especially relevant with therapeutic agents such as
cisplatin, doxorubicin, and TMZ which are widely used
to treat breast, pancreatic, and brain cancer. To date, most
efforts in the area of personalized medicine have focused
on using genomic and/or proteomic profiling techniques to
identify prognostic biomarkers for therapeutic intervention.
Several groups have shown that higher POLH expression
correlates with poor patient outcomes, particularly with
respect to treatment with DNA damaging agents [28–30].
Unfortunately, similar genetic approaches have failed
to produce clear correlations in patient responses to
chemotherapy with other specialized DNA polymerases
such as pol k and pol z [31–33]. These discrepancies likely
reflect the complexities associated with the large number
and diversity of human DNA polymerases that can cause
drug resistance by replicating damaged DNA. We propose
that 3-Eth-5-NITP can overcome these complications since
this artificial nucleotide behaves as a universal and highly
selective substrate for chromosomal and specialized DNA
polymerase that replicate abasic sites. The unique ability
of 3-Eth-5-NIdR to directly measure TLS activity against
this lesion can be used in activity-based assays to quantify
the collective activity of all cellular DNA polymerases that
perform TLS. This activity based assay would provide
more physiologically relevant data compared to genomic
and proteomic techniques which simply infer enzyme
activity by measuring mRNA or protein levels.
Finally, the data provided here clearly show the
potential therapeutic utility for inhibiting TLS activity
as a way to increase the cell killing effects of anti-cancer
agents that damage DNA. Our data demonstrate that low
concentrations of 3-Eth-5-NIdR significantly increase
the cytotoxicity of TMZ by inhibiting TLS activity. This
inhibition could produce several beneficial effects in patients
receiving chemotherapy. For instance, sensitizing cancer
cells to the effects of a DNA damaging agent provides a
strategy to administer lower drug doses which would reduce
the risk of potential side effects. Again, this is particularly
important with drugs such as cisplatin and cyclophosphamide
that produce severe and debilitating side effects. Indeed, the
ability of the these agents to non-selective kill of healthy yet
rapidly proliferating cells such as B- and T-cells accounts for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

side effects such as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia that
can compromise a patient’s response to chemotherapy [34].
Finally, targeting TLS activity also provides a rationale way
to combat drug resistance caused by the up-regulation of promutagenic DNA synthesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture
MOLT4 cells were cultured in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37° C. Cells were maintained in
ATCC-formulated RPMI-1640 media supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5% L-glutamine, and 0.5%
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, NY).

Reagents
Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), antibiotic and
antifungal agents, amphotericin, propidium iodide,
PrestoBlue, DAPI, Alexa Fluor 488, and apoptosis
assay kit containing Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Annexin V
were from Invitrogen. 3-Eth-5-NIdR and 3-Eth-5-NITP
were synthesized and purified as previously described
[13, 15]. DNA including that containing an abasic site
were obtained from Operon and purified as described
[13, 15]. Recombinant human polymerase delta (pol δ) and
human polymerase eta (pol η) were purified as previously
described [35, 36]. Each polymerase was judged to
be > 97% pure as assessed by sodium dodecylsulfatepolyacrylamide denaturing gel electrophoresis.

Cell viability assays
3-Eth-5-NIdR was added to wells in a dose-dependent
manner (1−100 µg/mL) and treated for variable time periods
(24−72 hr). In all cases, the final concentration of the cosolvent, DMSO, was maintained at 0.1%. Cell viability was
assessed using trypan blue staining to count the number of
viable versus non-viable cells using a hemocytometer. Cell
viability was also assessed with a Muse Cell Count (EMD
Millipore). IC50 values for the artificial nucleoside and anticancer agents were obtained using a non-linear regression
curve fit of the data to Equation 1.
y = 100% / (1 + (IC50/[Compound]))
(1)
LD50 values for the artificial nucleoside were
calculated using identical approaches.

Apoptosis measurements

dGTP (500 µM final concentration) was added to initiate
the elongation reaction. Aliquots of the reactions were
quenched with 200 mM EDTA at variable times (0-30
minutes) and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis
to assess elongation beyond dATP or 3-Eth5-NITP.

Cells (100,000 – 200,000 cells/mL) were treated
with 0.1% DMSO (vehicle), 5 µM UdR, 10 µg/mL 3-Eth5-NIdR, and 5 µM UdR with 10 µg/mL 3-Eth-5-NIdR
for 48 hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation,
washed in PBS, and re-suspended in 100 µL of binding
buffer containing 5 µM of Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488
conjugate. Cells were treated with 1 µg/ mL PI and
incubated at room temperature for 15 min followed by
flow cytometry analysis. Cells were analyzed using either
Muse Cell analyzer or Beckman Coulter EPICS-XL with
EXPO 32 Data Acquisition software. 15,000-gated events
were observed for each sample.
“Click” reactions were performed using cells
harvested after 2 days of treatment with DMSO, EdU (0–5
μM), TMZ (100 µM), 3-Eth-5-NIdR (10 μg/mL), or TMZ
(100 µM) with 3-Eth-5-NIdR (10 μg/mL). All cells were
fixed with cold methanol overnight. Cells were treated
with 0.3 mL of saponin-based permeabilization and wash
buffer for 45 min at 37 °C. Click reactions were initiated
with click-iT reaction cocktail followed by incubation at 37
°C for 90 min. Cells were washed twice with wash buffer.
Cell pellets were dislodged using 0.5 mL solution of 10 μg/
mL PI and RNAase A in saponin-based permeabilization
buffer. Cells were incubated for 15 min with 1 µg/mL
DAPI prior to analysis. Images were obtained using an
EVOSfl Advanced microscope (40X magnification).

Quantifying abasic site formation
DNA was isolated using the genomic DNA mini
kit as described by the manufacturer (IBI Scientific). The
concentration and purity of isolated DNA was measured
using agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric
analyses (Spectramax M4, Molecular Devices). Genomic
DNA was diluted in TE buffer to a final concentration of
100 μg/μl. Measurements were performed with the use of
a commercially available kit for abasic sites site counting
(DNA Damage Quantification Kit, Dojindo Molecular
Technologies). All assays using the aldehyde reactive
probe (ARP) were performed in triplicate, and the means
were calculated. Data were calculated on the basis of a
linear calibration curve with ARP-DNA standard solution
and expressed as number of apurinic sites per 100,000
nucleotides.

Statistical analyses
All data showing error bars are presented as mean
± s.e.m. The significance of difference in the mean value
was determined using a two-tailed Student’s t-test and
normal distribution was assumed in all cases. A one-way
ANOVA analysis was used to compare the effects of cells
treated with the combination of 3-Eth-5-NIdR and DNA
damaging agent versus treatment with DMSO, 3-Eth5-NIdR, and DNA damaging agent alone to determine
p-values. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.
All calculations were performed using KaleidaGraph
software. All cell culture experiments were reproduced at
least three times independently. For each experiment, the
number of samples and replicates are provided in the text
or figure legend.

Kinetic parameters for nucleotide incorporation
Kinetic studies using polymerase delta and polymerase
eta were performed using an assay buffer consisting of
50 mM TrisOAc, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 10 mM
DTT, and 5 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.5. All assays were performed
at 37°C. kcat, Km, and kcat/Km values for nucleotides were
measured as described (37). Data for the dependency of
rate as a function of nucleotide concentration were fit to the
Michaelis–Menten equation (Equation 3):
ν = Vmax * [dXTP] / (Km + [dXTP])
(3)
where ν is the rate of product formation analysis, the
most important parameter (nM/s), Vmax is the maximal rate
of polymerization, Km is the Michaelis constant for dXTP,
and [dXTP] is the concentration of nucleotide substrate.
The turnover number, kcat, is Vmax divided by the final
concentration of polymerase used in each assay.
