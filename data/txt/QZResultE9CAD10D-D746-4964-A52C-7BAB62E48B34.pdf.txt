ABSTRACT
Mesothelin is a tumor differentiation antigen expressed by epithelial tumors,
including pancreatic cancer. Currently, mesothelin is being targeted with an antibodydrug conjugate (ADC) consisting of a mesothelin-specific antibody coupled to a highly
potent chemotherapeutic drug. Considering the toxicity of the ADC and reduced
accessibility of pancreatic tumors, non-invasive imaging could provide necessary
information. We therefore developed a zirconium-89 (89Zr) labeled anti-mesothelin
antibody (89Zr-AMA) to study its biodistribution in human pancreatic tumor bearing
mice. Biodistribution and dose-finding of 89Zr-AMA were studied 144 h after tracer
injection in mice with subcutaneously xenografted HPAC. MicroPET imaging was
performed 24, 72 and 144 h after tracer injection in mice bearing HPAC or Capan-2.
Tumor uptake and organ distribution of 89Zr-AMA were compared with nonspecific
111
In-IgG. Biodistribution analyses revealed a dose-dependent 89Zr-AMA tumor uptake.
Tumor uptake of 89Zr-AMA was higher than 111In-IgG using the lowest tracer dose.
MicroPET showed increased tumor uptake over 6 days, whereas activity in blood pool
and other tissues decreased. Immunohistochemistry showed that mesothelin was
expressed by the HPAC and CAPAN-2 tumors and fluorescence microscopy revealed
that AMA-800CW was present in tumor cell cytoplasm. 89Zr-AMA tumor uptake is
antigen-specific in mesothelin-expressing tumors. 89Zr-AMA PET provides noninvasive, real-time information about AMA distribution and tumor targeting.

Until now chemotherapy and targeted agents have
yielded only modest effects [2]. This has stimulated
a search for new approaches; one such approach is
the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), which consists
of a specific antibody armed with a highly potent
chemotherapeutic drug that will be released after
internalization. Mesothelin might serve as a target
for ADCs. It is a tumor differentiation antigen highly

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive
tumor entities, with a dismal prognosis. Despite advances
in treatment of solid tumors, pancreatic cancer has a 5 year
survival rate of only 6% and a median survival of about
6 months [1]. This poor prognosis is due to its advanced
stage at diagnosis and limited curative treatment options.

expressed by cells of many epithelial cancers, with limited
expression in normal human tissues [3]. Mesothelin is
overexpressed in mesothelioma, ovarian cancers, and in
70–100% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas [4, 5].
Interestingly, its expression in normal tissues is limited to
mesothelial cells on pleura, pericardium and peritoneum
[6, 7]. A number of early clinical results suggest the
validity of using mesothelin as target. In a phase II study
with the anti-mesothelin immunotoxin SS1P combined
with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide, three out of
10 evaluable patients showed major regression [8].
In addition, in a phase I study combining SS1P with
pemetrexed and cisplatin 12 out of 20 patients had a partial
response and three showed stable disease [9].
The precise dosing of drugs and selection of patients
for mesothelin directed therapy could benefit from noninvasive visualization of anti-mesothelin antibody
(AMA) to quantify antibody uptake in tumor lesions,
and ultimately to relate this to anti-tumor effects of
mesothelin-targeting ADC. Labeling AMA with long-lived
positron zirconium-89 (89Zr) might allow non-invasive
tracking using PET. 89Zr-labeled antibodies have already
been studied in preclinical and clinical setting [10, 11].
The aim of this study was to develop and
evaluate 89Zr-labeled AMA for non-invasive tracking of
biodistribution towards pancreatic tumors and organs
of interest in mice. In addition, a near infrared (NIR)
fluorescent dye (IRDye 800CW) was labeled to AMA to
investigate tracer distribution at cellular level.

of 2:1 and 5:1 and resulted in an effective conjugation
of 69% and 65% respectively, and therefore a true
DfAR of 1.3:1 and 3.5:1. Quality control also showed
less than 5% aggregates of the conjugated antibody.
N-suc-Df-TFP-AMA was labeled with 89Zr; the resulting
89
Zr-N-sucDf-AMA is hereafter referred to as 89Zr-AMA.
Labeling resulted in a high radiochemical efficiency of
93.4% ± 2.3% (n = 5), without further purification, and
a high specific activity (>500 MBq/mg). The 1.3:1 DfAR
obtained a maximum specific activity of 200 MBq/mg,
however, this is insufficient to label the amount of
radiation needed for microPET scans for all the AMA
doses of interest. Therefore the 3.5:1 DfAR was used in
further experiments.
89
Zr-AMA was radiochemically stable in solution
(0.9% NaCl) when stored at 4 and 20°C for over 168 h.
Protein-bound 89Zr decreased minimally; from 98.3% to
98.0% after storing it for 7 days at 4°C, and from 98.3%
to 96.4% after 7 days at 20°C (Supplementary Figure 1A).
DfAR conjugation in ratios of 1.3:1 or 3.5:1 did
not affect binding affinity of AMA (P < 0.05, Figure 1).
Immunoreactivity assay of 89Zr-AMA showed ~50%
inhibition of the maximum binding of 14 nM AMA
for competition of extracellular domain of mesothelin
binding of 14 nM 89Zr-AMA, indicating a fully preserved
immunoreactivity.

Dose-escalation and biodistribution studies
Biodistribution studies in mice with HPAC tumors
showed specific tumor uptake of 89Zr-AMA compared
to nonspecific control for all three doses of 10, 25, and
100 μg (P < 0.05, Figure 2). Nonspecific IgG was labeled
with 111In in order to be able to distinguish between
nonspecific uptake and specific 89Zr-AMA uptake in the
same mouse. This co-injection of tracers allows correcting
for potential inter-individual differences. At 144 h after
injection, the highest percentage tumor uptake was seen in
the 10 μg dose group which was almost 4 times higher than
nonspecific control (14.2% ID/g 89Zr-AMA vs. 3.7%ID/g
111
In-IgG; P < 0.05, Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1).

Tumor uptake decreased with increasing doses of
AMA (P < 0.05, one way analysis of variance) from
14.2 ± 2.5%ID/g with 10 μg dose, to 11.1 ± 0.6%ID/g
with 25 μg dose, and 7.5 ± 1.1%ID/g with 100 μg dose
(Figure 2). Ex vivo analysis of isolated organs indicated
a normal distribution of 89Zr-AMA and 111In-IgG. Both
tracers showed a similar uptake pattern in most organs
in all groups of mice, with few exceptions. 89Zr-AMA
tumor uptake was higher than 111In-IgG with every dose
(respectively 3.8, 2.8, and 1.5 fold higher), indicating
tumor specific uptake. Bone also showed a 3.5 fold higher
activity for 89Zr-AMA than nonspecific control. At 10 μg
89
Zr-AMA tumor-to-blood ratio was 3.08 ± 0.55 and

tumor-to-muscle ratio 15.57 ± 5.61. With increasing doses
these ratios decreased, indicating dose dependent and
saturable tracer distribution.

MicroPET and IVIS imaging
Based on results from the dose-escalation
biodistribution study 10 μg 89Zr-AMA was used
for imaging experiments. MicroPET scans showed
homogeneous 89Zr-AMA tracer uptake within the tumors
at each time point. Tumor uptake increased visibly
over time, whereas activity in blood pool decreased
(Figure 3A, 3C).

Tumor accumulation over time was demonstrated
by the mean of standardized uptake value (SUVmean)
quantification (Figure 3B, 3D). For HPAC tumors it
increased from 1.09 ± 0.24, to 1.51 ± 0.29, and 1.68 ± 0.33
from 24 h to 72 and 144 h respectively. For Capan-2
tumors uptake increased from 0.70 ± 0.18, to 1.18 ± 0.32,
and 1.40 ± 0.41 at 24, 72, and 144 h after tracer injection.
Ex vivo 89Zr-AMA uptake proved to be tumor-specific
in both cell lines (Figure 4A, 4B and Online Resource,

Supplementary Table 1), and tumor uptake was consistent
with imaging data as %ID/g correlated with SUVmean (see
Supplementary Figure 2). 89Zr-AMA tumor uptake was
similar for the HPAC and Capan-2 xenografts (P = 1.000),
and quantification of tumor, liver, spleen, and kidney
showed comparable results for both cell lines.
Binding affinity of the AMA molecule for
mesothelin ECD was preserved after labeling with 800CW.
Of the two ratios (Dye:mAb) tested, the 2:1 label ratio

may seem a rather low uptake, but a recent study using an
111
In-labeled anti-ERC/mesothelin mouse monoclonal
IgG2a did not exceed 5.8%ID/g in the tumor at any time
point of 24, 48 or 96 h [12]. The differences between these
studies are likely the consequence of differences in tumor
exposure given differences in pharmacokinetics (PK) of
the antibodies. Liver showed a relatively high activity with
111
In-labeled antibody compared with tumor (respectively 15
versus 5.8%ID/g at 96 h), indicating clearance, whereas our
89
Zr-AMA showed better PK in relation to tumor specificity
and blood accumulation, and lower non-specific clearance.
This may be explained by the relatively low and controlled
conjugation ratio of TFP-N-sucDesferal to AMA, minimizing
the possible alterations in PK properties of the antibody.
We could accurately visualize tracer tumor uptake
in two models of xenografted pancreatic adenocarcinoma
tumors with 89Zr-AMA PET. 89Zr-AMA PET showed
specific binding to the target with an increase in
radioactivity in tumor over time, while the amount of
radioactivity decreased in normal organs. Both xenograft
types showed similar results despite the different
mesothelin expression. This may be due to the fact that the
tracer dose was below the saturation limit of the target, or
the fact that different internalization rates might cancel out
different cell-surface levels. Tumor-uptake of the tracer
exceeded the uptake in surrounding tissue, resulting in a
good tumor-to-background ratio. Uptake of control did not
exceed uptake in surrounding tissues, making it possible
to differentiate between specific and non-specific uptake.
Mesothelin was expressed on cell membrane
as indicated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) data.
Fluorescent microscopy of AMA-800CW suggests that
the tracer is internalized, although target expression on
membrane could not be visualized as the Hoechst staining
washed away any of the membrane-bound AMA-800CW.
MicroPET data indicated a relatively high activity
in joints of the mice of 8.5% with 89Zr-AMA but not

Mesothelin expression was observed in both HPAC
and Capan-2 cells and not in H441 control (data not
shown). Mesothelin expression was less pronounced in
HPAC cells than Capan-2.
Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining of tumors showed
that they consisted purely of tumor tissue and that Capan-2
tumors are more differentiated than HPAC tumors (data
not shown). All tumors contained viable tumor cells as
well as areas of necrosis due to duct formation, typical
for pancreatic tissue. Mesothelin staining was stronger in
Capan-2 tumors than in HPAC tumors. Mesothelin staining
was present in tumor nests and most strongly expressed at
the apical side of tumor cells surrounding ducts (Figure 6A).
Fluorescence microscopy revealed that 800CW is mainly
located in the cytoplasm of tumor cells (Figure 6B and 6D).

DISCUSSION
This study shows that it is possible to visualize
subcutaneously implanted human pancreatic tumors in mice
noninvasively over time with the PET tracer 89 Zr-AMA.
The results indicate a specific mesothelin-driven tumor
uptake of targeted 89Zr-labeled antibody which visualizes
human mesothelin expressing pancreatic adenocarcinoma
in real time.
The biodistribution study showed an increase in tumor
uptake over time; on average an 89Zr-AMA tumor uptake of
14.2% ID/g was seen at 144 h after tracer injection. This

with 111In-IgG, indicating an 89Zr-specific mechanism. Bone
uptake of 89Zr might be due to trans-chelation of 89Zr from
AMA to plasma proteins or AMA catabolites, and from
there deposition in bone [13]. 89Zr specifically accumulates
in mineralized constituents, like epiphysis [14]. This
89
Zr-related, antibody non-specific uptake in bone is
observed in rodents [15]. However, it has no clinical
consequences for imaging in humans, as clinical imaging
studies show no visible bone uptake on PET scans [16].
Radiolabeling the naked antibody of an ADC can
provide interesting information concerning accessibility
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the tumor for antibodies and availability of the target in
tumors. Using 89Zr-PET to better understand the properties
of a therapeutic antibody has been described previously
[17]. This is especially important for ADCs, as they are
not only dependent on the accessibility of the tumor, but
also on the extent and internalization of target present.
A trial is analyzing whether an 89Zr-trastuzumab PET
imaging can predict which patients will not respond to the
ADC trastuzumab-DM1. A preliminary report indicated
that a combination of pre-treatment, 89Zr-trastuzumab

positron emission tomography–computed tomography
(FDG-PET/CT), with response assessment after 1 cycle
seems potentially capable to identify patients unlikely to
show a metabolic response after 3 cycles of T-DM1 [18].
Studying mesothelin with molecular imaging in
the clinic may be increasingly of interest giving the
increment of treatment options tested that use mesothelin
as a target and the broad range of tumor that can express
mesothelin [19].
Mesothelin was targeted with a SPECT tracer
namely an 111In-labeled chimeric antibody. In all patients
a tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) of at least 1.2 was
observed [20]. Our findings with 89Zr-AMA were also
translated to a clinical trial. This tracer should potentially
make it easier to quantify tracer uptake than the SPECT
tracer. We GMP-produced 89Zr-AMA for a phase I study
of a mesothelin-targeting ADC in pancreatic and ovarian
cancer patients [21]. In the main study patients received
the ADC study drug comprising this AMA armed with the
anti-mitotic drug MMAE. In a side study patients received
baseline 89Zr-AMA-PET scans before starting ADC
treatment. These PET scans were performed to quantify
antibody uptake in pancreatic and ovarian tumor lesions
and ultimately to relate this uptake to anti-tumor effects
(http://ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01832116).
These findings highlight the ability of 89Zr-AMA
PET to provide non-invasive, real-time information about
AMA distribution and tumor targeting and argue for an
expansion of ongoing efforts to use PET imaging in the
development of ADCs.

protein-bound radioactivity using trichloroacetic acid
(TCA) precipitation. Before storage the sample was
purified by ultra filtration. TCA precipitation was
performed in PBS with 0.5% human serum albumin
(Sanquin) and 20% TCA. Radioactivity in precipitate
and supernatant was determined by a calibrated well-type
γ-counter (LKB Instruments).
Immunoreactivity of N-sucDf-AMA was tested with
an ELISA assay with conjugated and unconjugated AMA.
The extracellular domain (ECD) of mesothelin (provided
by Genentech) was used to coat a 96-well plate (10 μg/mL,
Nunc MaxiSorp, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Immunoreactivity of radiolabeled antibody was
tested as described earlier [10]. The assay was performed
with unlabeled and unconjugated AMA and 89Zr-AMA
using ECD of mesothelin as target. Unlabeled AMA
was added in a logarithmic concentration range of
1 ng/mL – 1 mg/mL, while 89Zr-AMA was kept at a fixed
concentration of 1000 ng/mL.
Human IgG served as a nonspecific control in the
in vivo experiments. To be able to differentiate between
AMA and IgG, 111In was chosen as radiolabel for IgG.
This allowed co-injection of tracer and control in the
same animal, making the animal its own control and
reduced the number of animals needed. Human IgG
(Sanquin) was conjugated to 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-DTPA)
and radiolabeled with 111InCl3 (Mallinckrodt) on day of
use as published earlier [23].

Cell lines

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Human pancreatic tumor cell lines HPAC and
Capan-2 (American Type Culture Collection) were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Bodinco BV) at 37°C
in a fully humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Short tandem repeat (STR) profiling (BaseClear) affirmed
identity. Cell lines were quarantined until screening for
microbial contamination and mycoplasma had been
performed; these tests were negative. In all experiments
mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 5 × 106 HPAC
or Capan-2 cells. For analysis of receptor expression, cells
were incubated with anti-human mesothelin phycoerythrin
(catalog number: FAB32652P, R&D systems). Human
lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line H441 (American
Type Culture Collection) served as negative control.
Membrane receptor expression was analyzed using flow
cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) with Winlist
software 6.0 (Verity Software House).

Ethics statement
All applicable international, national and/or
institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals
were followed.

Conjugation, 89Zr labeling of AMA, and 111In
labeling of IgG
Anti-mesothelin humanized IgG1 monoclonal
antibody was conjugated with TFP-N-sucDf, at start DfAR
of 2:1 and 5:1. These ratios were chosen based on previous
experience [10, 11], a DfAR of 2:1 obtains clear images
in the clinic, but a higher specific activity is needed for
animal experiments, therefore a DfAR of 5:1 was made.
Both DfARs were tested for suitability and labeled with
clinical-grade 89Zr-oxalate (IBA Molecular) as described
previously [22]. 89Zr-N-sucDf-AMA is hereafter referred
to as 89Zr-AMA.
N-sucDf-AMA and 89Zr-AMA were analyzed
for conjugation ratios, aggregation and radiochemical
purity by SE-HPLC. Storage stability of 89Zr-AMA
was tested in 0.9% NaCl at 4 and 20°C by determining

were performed using isoflurane in medical air inhalation
anesthesia (induction 5%, maintenance 2%). At 6–8 weeks
of age the mice were injected subcutaneously in the left
flank with HPAC cells in 0.2 mL of 1:1 growth medium
and Matrigel (BD Bioscience). Tumor growth was
estimated with caliper measurements. Mice were used
for experiments when tumors measured at least 100 mm3,
~2 weeks after tumor inoculation.
Biodistribution studies were conducted in mice
bearing HPAC xenograft tumors to evaluate mesothelinspecific tumor uptake and dose-dependent tumor uptake
of AMA. 89Zr-AMA and 111In-IgG were compared for
biodistribution in 3 dose groups: 10, 25, or 100 μg
(approximately 0.5, 1.2 and 5.0 mg/kg body weight) of
both proteins. Each dose was administered to 6 mice
intravenously in the penile vein, with a co-injection
of the  same dose of nonspecific control, both labeled
with ± 1  MBq of respectively 89Zr and 111In. Animals
were sacrificed 144 h after tracer injection and organs
were excised, rinsed for residual blood, weighed, and
counted for radioactivity. Tissue activity was expressed
as percentage injected dose per gram tissue (%ID/g),
with an assumption of tissue density of 1 g/cm3 [24].
All data were corrected for physical decay using known
standards. Subsequently, tumors were split, formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded, and stored at −80°C for ex vivo
mesothelin measurements.

AMA localization within tumor was studied
using fluorescent labeled AMA. For production of the
fluorescent tracer 1000 μg AMA was labeled with IRDye
800CW-NHS (LI-COR Biosciences) in a ratio of 2:1 and
4:1 (Dye:mAb) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Final product was analyzed as described previously [26].
Immunoreactivity of fluorescent AMA was tested with
an ELISA assay. A ratio of 2:1 was used in the animal
experiments.
Ten mice were injected subcutaneously with HPAC
cells. Approximately 2 weeks after tumor inoculation,
when tumors measured at least 200 mm3, fluorescent
imaging agent (100 μg AMA-800CW) was injected via
the penile vein. Fluorescence images using IVIS Spectrum
were obtained 24 (n = 10), 72 (n = 7) and 144 h (n = 4)
after tracer injection. Following each scan, a number of
mice were sacrificed and tumors were excised for ex vivo
analysis.
Fluorescence images were retrieved by using
excitation wavelengths of 745 nm and a filter of
800 nm. Data were analyzed using Living Image 4.3.1
software (Caliper Life Sciences). To determine tumorto-background ratios (TBR) from NIR fluorescent
images, tumor boundary was set as ROI, and the ratio
was calculated by comparing tumor uptake with shoulder
muscle of the animal as background value.

Ex vivo tissue analysis

MicroPET and IVIS imaging

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors were
stained using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) for histology,
and mesothelin expression was immunohistochemically
stained with an anti-mesothelin isoform 1 antibody (clone
#420404; R&D Systems).
For fluorescence microscopy, tumor slides were
stained with Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen).

Based on dose escalation and biodistribution
experiments, a dose of 10 μg was used in animal imaging
and distribution studies. For imaging a microPET Focus
220 rodent scanner (CTI Siemens) was used. Two groups
of 6 animals were subcutaneously injected with either
HPAC or Capan-2 cells.
Approximately 2 weeks after tumor inoculation,
10 μg of AMA labeled with 5 MBq 89Zr was injected via
the penile vein, with a co-injection of 10 μg of IgG labeled
with 1 MBq 111In.
Static images of animals were acquired with
an acquisition time of 15–60 min at 24, 72 and 144 h
after tracer injection. Images were corrected for scatter
and attenuation. After image reconstruction, in vivo
quantification was performed with AMIDE (A Medical
Image Data Examiner) software (version 1.0.2; Stanford
University) [25] and tumor accumulation was calculated
as the mean of standardized uptake value (SUVmean). For
region-of-interest (ROI) measurements, tumor volumes
were manually drawn as described earlier [26], based on
tumor weight measured ex vivo, assuming a tissue density
of 1 g/mL. Animals were sacrificed after the last scan
(t = 144 h) and organs were excised, rinsed for residual
blood weighed and counted for radioactivity. Tumors were
split, one part formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, and
one part stored at -80°C for ex vivo measurements.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical
analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test
for non-parametric data (Prism, version 5; GraphPad
Software). A P value of 0.05 was considered significant.
The correlation between quantified in vivo small-animal
PET images and ex vivo biodistribution data was estimated
by linear regression.
