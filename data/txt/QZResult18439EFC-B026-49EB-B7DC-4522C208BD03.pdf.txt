Abstract

Author Manuscript

Interrogating specific cellular activities often entails the dissection of posttranslational
modifications or functional redundancy conferred by protein families, which demands more
sophisticated research tools than simply eliminating a specific gene product by gene targeting or
RNAi. We have developed a novel methodology that involves engineering a single SCFβTrCPbased ubiquitin ligase that is capable of not only simultaneously targeting the entire family of
ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases for ubiquitination and degradation, but also selectively recruiting
only activated ErbBs. The engineered SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase effectively blocked ErbB
signaling and attenuated oncogenicity in breast cancer cells, yet had little effect on the survival
and growth of non-cancerous breast epithelial cells. Therefore, engineering ubiquitin ligases offers
a simple research tool to dissect the specific traits of tumorigenic protein families, and provides a
rapid and feasible means to expand the dimensionality of drug discovery by assessing protein
families or posttranslational modifications as potential drug targets.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Normal or oncogenic signaling are often orchestrated by not one, but multiple members of
signaling proteins with redundant functions. Efficacy of targeted inhibition of one signaling
molecule is frequently compromised as a result of compensatory upregulation of another
family member, which accounts in part for the resistance to targeted therapy. Moreover,
activation of a given signaling pathway under physiological or pathological conditions
further entails posttranslational modifications of signaling molecules, e.g. phosphorylation
of receptor tyrosine kinases. Such complexities present challenges of inactivating a disease
pathway by targeting one signaling protein, yet offer new avenues or strategies for disease
intervention by collectively abrogating the entire family of functionally overlapping

proteins, or by ablation of a specific posttranslational event that is preferentially
dysregulated in a diseased state. However, functional assessments of these new biological
space in drug discovery require more sophisticated tools than simple elimination of a given
target protein by established methodology, such as RNAi or gene targeting. In this regard,
chemical inhibitors can potentially fulfill the desired functionality, but they are often not
available at this early discovery stage, and are developed after a specific drug target is
validated. As such, efforts to explore the value of cellular protein families as emerging drug
targets are largely hampered by the lack of effective experimental tools in pre-clinical and
clinical models.

One example of such cases is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB) family,
which consists of EGFR (EGFR/HER-1 or ErbB1), ErbB-2 (Neu or HER-2), ErbB3
(HER-3), and ErbB4 (HER-4). It has been established that the ErbB RTKs are frequently
hyper-activated in cancers and contribute to tumor survival, growth, progression,
angiogenesis, and metastasis (1–7). Overexpression of ErbB2 is found in nearly 20% of
breast cancer patients as well as other malignancies, and is correlated with shorter relapsefree survival and poor prognosis. Individual ErbB RTKs have been intensely pursued as
therapeutic targets through the attenuation of their signaling activities (8–11). Numerous
attempts have been made to inhibit EGFR and ErbB2 signaling, such as inactivating
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the extracellular domain of the receptors and
chemical inhibitors that block intracellular tyrosine kinase activity. Currently, novel
therapeutic strategies targeting multiple ErbB RTKs are being intensely pursued as more
effective ways to block the ErbB signaling that is often necessary to sustain tumor growth
and survival. Moreover, in order to reduce the potential cytotoxicity to normal cells that
results from ErbB eradication, it is preferable to selectively target activated, tyrosinephosphorylated ErbB RTKs instead of knocking out all ErbB expression. However, such
specific and multifaceted manipulation of ErbB activity is technically challenging using
conventional methods and tools.

Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis constitutes the major pathway that eukaryotic cells employ
to degrade cellular proteins, and involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the
E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and the E3 ubiquitin
ligase. Of these enzymes, the E3 ubiquitin ligase is exclusively responsible for defining
substrate specificity through direct binding to the target protein. The multimeric SCFβTrCP
ubiquitin ligase, which consists of Skp1, CUL1, the F-box-containing βTrCP substrate
receptor and the Rbx1/Roc1/Hrt1 adaptor, selectively targets a variety of key regulators of
the cell cycle, cell signaling and transcription for ubiquitination and degradation (12).
Among the SCF subunits, the F-box protein βTrCP is exclusively responsible for substrate
recognition and recruitment. Engineering F-box proteins has been established as a powerful
strategy to direct the SCF machinery to target a variety of cellular proteins for degradation in
cultured eukaryotic cells and animal models (reviewed in (13) and references therein). More
specifically, the SCF ubiquitination machinery can be harnessed to degrade non-SCF targets
by attaching an F-box protein to a peptide or motif that is able to bind to the protein of
interest (13–21).

In this study, we fused the phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) from the Shc signaling
protein to the C-terminus of βTrCP to selectively capture all activated (tyrosinephosphorylated) EGFR/ErbB family proteins and recruit them to the SCF machinery for
degradation. Our data demonstrated the efficacy of the engineered F-TrCP-Shc E3 ligase in
selectively inducing ubiquitin-mediated degradation of all activated ErbB family proteins.
We also showed that F-TrCP-Shc suppressed tumor growth through increased apoptosis and
G1 arrest, sensitized ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells to cisplatin-mediated killing,
and inhibited tumorigenicity in nude mice.

RESULTS
The engineered F-TrCP-Shc ubiquitin ligase interacts with ErbB2 and induces its
degradation in a dose-dependent manner

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To specifically recruit activated (oncogenic) ErbB proteins to the SCF ubiquitination
machinery, we first engineered a chimeric F-TrCP-Shc ubiquitin ligase with the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of the Shc adaptor protein fused in-frame to the carboxyl
terminus of βTrCP and a FLAG tag at the N-terminus (Fig. 1A). The PTB domain of Shc
specifically binds to the tyrosine phosphorylated/activated intracellular domain of EGFR
(pY1114, pY1086 and pY1148), ErbB2 (pY1248), ErbB3 (pY1328) and ErbB4 (pY1284)
(22–25). In order to verify the specificity of the F-TrCP-Shc/ErbB interaction, we created a
phospho-ErbB binding-defective construct, F-TrCP-Shc(m), that possesses the F198V point
mutation in the PTB domain but is otherwise identical to F-TrCP-Shc (Fig. 1A) (26). To test
the binding of the engineered F-TrCP-Shc ubiquitin ligase to ErbB2, FLAG-tagged chimeric
constructs were transiently transfected into 293T cells and co-immunoprecipitation
experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 1B, F-TrCP-Shc, but not F-TrCP-Shc(m)
effectively binds to endogenous ErbB2. To investigate whether F-TrCP-Shc can reduce
endogenous ErbB2 levels through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, 293T cells were
transfected with increasing doses of F-TrCP-Shc or F-TrCP-Shc(m). Indeed, the ectopic
expression of F-TrCP-Shc induced robust poly-ubiquitination and dose-dependent
downregulation of endogenous ErbB2, whereas the binding-deficient F-TrCP-Shc(m) did
not (Fig. 1C–D).

Author Manuscript

Ubiquitinated ErbB receptors can be degraded by either the 26S proteasome or trafficked to
the lysosomes for destruction (27, 28). As seen in Fig. 1E and 1F, treatment of F-TrCP-Shcexpressing cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocked ErbB2 degradation, while
the lysosomal acidification inhibitor chloroquine had no discernable effect, indicating that
the engineered F-TrCP-Shc construct preferentially directs ErbB2 towards proteasomal
degradation. Therefore, the PTB domain of Shc, upon fusion to F-TrCP, effectively binds
ErbB2 and recruits it to the SCF machinery for ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent
degradation.
F-TrCP-Shc promotes degradation of all ErbB family proteins and inhibits ErbB signaling
The compensatory increase in the expression levels of other ErbB family members has been
reported to contribute to the acquired resistance of breast cancer cells to ErbB2 inhibitory
drugs in patients (29). This finding raises the question of whether the simultaneous

attenuation of all ErbB proteins could potentially improve the therapeutic efficacy and
outcome in cancer patients with ErbB over-activation. Thus, we selected the Shc PTB
domain for fusion with βTrCP since Shc functions as a mediator of ErbB signaling and
interacts with all members of the ErbB family upon RTK activation. F-TrCP-Shc is
therefore able to degrade all activated ErbB RTKs, which creates a unique opportunity to
examine the physiological consequences of fully attenuated ErbB signaling. Indeed, FTrCP-Shc but not F-TrCP-Shc(m) stimulates ubiquitination of EGFR and ErbB3 (Fig. S1).

To achieve sustained degradation of ErbB RTKs, BT474 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells
were infected with recombinant retroviruses expressing either F-TrCP-Shc, F-TrCP-Shc(m)
or the pBMN-GFP viral vector. Infected cells with chromosomally-integrated chimeric FTrCP transgenes were isolated by FACS based on the expression of GFP from the viral
vector. The endogenous expression levels of ErbB RTKs (overall protein levels including
the tyrosine phosphorylated/activated subpopulations) in BT474 and SKBR3 cells were
determined by Western blotting (Fig. 2A–B, lane 1). We note that three ErbB proteins,
EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB3, are expressed in BT474 and SKBR3 cells and the activated
subpopulations of these ErbB RTKs can be detected using their respective phospho-specific
antibodies (Fig. 2A–B, lane 1). However, ErbB4 expression cannot be detected in BT474 or
SKBR3 cells (data not shown), as documented previously (29). As shown in Fig. 2A and 2B,
the constitutive expression of F-TrCP-Shc selectively degraded tyrosine-phosphorylated
ErbB2 in both SKBR3 and BT474 cells, while the overall ErbB2 expression levels,
consisting predominantly of unmodified and inactive ErbB2, were largely unaffected.
Furthermore, F-TrCP-Shc also selectively depleted the activated pools of EGFR and ErbB3
without compromising their overall levels of expression (Fig. 2A–B, lane 2). In contrast, FTrCP-Shc(m), which is unable to interact with ErbB RTKs, had no effect on their steadystate levels (Fig. 2A–B, lane 3). The mRNA levels of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 in these cell
lines were not altered significantly by the ectopic expression of F-TrCP-Shc or F-TrCPShc(m) (Fig. S2). Taken together with the rescue of F-TrCP-Shc-induced ErbB2 degradation
by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 1E), we conclude that the engineered F-TrCP-Shc
ubiquitin ligase operates at the post-translational level to specifically ubiquitinate and
degrade the entire family of activated ErbB RTKs.

Ubiquitination of membrane receptors accelerates endocytosis, resulting in an overall
reduction in cell surface levels (28, 30, 31). In order to determine whether F-TrCP-Shc
induced receptor endocytosis, we employed a flow cytometry-based approach to measure
the levels of transmembrane ErbB2 using the anti-ErbB2 antibody against the extracellular
domain of the receptor. As shown in Fig. 2C, enforced retroviral expression of F-TrCP-Shc
effectively diminished ErbB2 from the cell surface of both SKBR3 and BT474 cells. In
comparison, expression of the pBMN-GFP control or F-TrCP-Shc(m) had minimal, if any,
influence in the cell surface pool of ErbB2 (Fig. 2C). This result was further corroborated by
adenoviral-driven high-level expression of F-TrCP-Shc that essentially eliminated the
presence of ErbB2 on the cell membrane of SKBR3 cells (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the
efficiency of membrane ErbB2 depletion correlated with the levels of F-TrCP-Shc
expression, as SKBR3 cells with low levels of chimeric E3 ligase expression (indicated by
low GFP expression) retained residual ErbB2 expression on the cell surface (Fig. 2D, white

arrow). Taken together, the targeted ubiquitination of ErbB2 resulted in the effective
depletion of membrane ErbB2 through increased ubiquitination.
Suppression of MAPK and PI3K signaling upon targeted degradation of ErbB RTKs

Author Manuscript

The downstream pathways activated by ErbB RTKs include the MAP kinase and AKT
signaling cascades, both of which play critical roles in tumorigenesis (recently reviewed in
(32) and references therein). Therefore, we next chose to examine whether targeting the
ErbB family of proteins with our E3 ligase had an effect on these crucial oncogenic
signaling pathways. As seen in Fig. 3A and 4A, the attenuation of ErbB signaling by
targeted proteolysis was accompanied by the diminished phosphorylation (and activation) of
AKT and MAPK. Thus, F-TrCP-Shc inhibited both signaling pathways in BT474 and
SKBR3 cells, while the overall levels of AKT and MAPK were not affected (Fig. 3A and
4A). In contrast, the constitutive expression of the binding-deficient F-TrCP-Shc(m) did not
alter phospho-AKT or phospho-MAPK levels and signaling, as compared with the control
pBMN-GFP-infected BT474 and SKBR3 cells (Fig. 3A and 4A). Therefore, the targeted
depletion of ErbB RTKs effectively attenuates the downstream MAPK and PI3K/AKT
signaling cascade.
Cell cycle inhibition and increased apoptosis occur upon depletion of ErbB RTK in breast
cancer cells

Author Manuscript

The ErbB receptor family members stimulate cell proliferation and promote the survival of
breast cancer as well as other tumor types. Thus, we next examined whether the targeted
degradation of all activated ErbB RTKs inhibits the growth and survival of BT474 and
SKBR3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B and Fig. 4B, the ectopic expression of F-TrCP-Shc led to
a marked reduction of the growth rates of BT474 and SKBR3 cells relative to their
corresponding F-TrCP-Shc(m) or pBMN-GFP controls. This observation is in accordance
with the previous finding that siRNAs targeting ErbB2 suppressed the proliferation of
ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells (33, 34).

Author Manuscript

We further determined the cell cycle profiles of SKBR3 cells infected with pBMN-F-TrCPShc, pBMN-F-TrCP-Shc(m) or pBMN-GFP retroviruses by measuring BrdU incorporation
via FACS analysis. As shown in Fig. 3C, the enforced expression of F-TrCP-Shc arrested
the cell cycle in G1 phase (81.3% G1 cells versus 59.7% and 61.9% in pBMN-GFP- and FTrCP-Shc(m)-expressing SKBR3 cells, respectively). Strikingly, F-TrCP-Shc induced
robust inhibition of DNA synthesis, as indicated by the reduction of BrdU-positive S phase
cells (0.73%) compared with those infected with control viruses (27.3% and 26.3% for
pBMN-GFP and F-TrCP-Shc(m) respectively) (Fig. 3C). The G1 cell cycle arrest induced
by F-TrCP-Shc was further demonstrated by a reduction in cyclin D1 expression and an
accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 (Fig. 3D). These results
revealed that F-TrCP-Shc inhibits cell proliferation via G1 cell cycle arrest in SKBR3 breast
cancer cells. Furthermore, the targeted degradation of ErbB RTKs induced approximately 3–
4 fold increase in apoptosis, as determined by Annexin V/7-AAD staining and FACS
analysis (Fig. 3E), as well as increased cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
(Fig. 3F). Therefore, the inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis by F-

TrCP-Shc both contribute to its growth suppressive effect on ErbB2-overexpressing SKBR3
cells.

Author Manuscript

In BT474 cells, the enforced expression of F-TrCP-Shc led to a modest inhibition of cell
cycle progression, as indicated by the approximately 10–14% reduction of S phase
populations compared with controls, and a concomitant increase in G1 and G2/M
populations (Fig. S3). However, the most striking effect of F-TrCP-Shc in BT474 cells is the
robust induction of apoptosis. As measured by Annexin V and 7-AAD staining and FACS
analysis, early apoptosis was increased 14-fold in F-TrCP-Shc-expressing cells compared to
pBMN-GFP cells (11.7% versus 0.83%), while F-TrCP-Shc(m) did not induce apoptosis
(0.79%) (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, increased PARP cleavage was detected in BT474 cells
stably expressing F-TrCP-Shc (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that the downregulation of
activated ErbB family proteins by F-TrCP-Shc triggers apoptosis in ErbB2-overexpressing
BT474 breast cancer cells.
Targeted depletion of ErbB RTKs had no discernable effect on non-cancerous MCF-10A
mammary epithelial cells

Author Manuscript

We next sought to determine whether non-cancerous mammary epithelial cells are also
subjected to F-TrCP-Shc-mediated growth inhibition, or if ErbB-overexpressing breast
cancers are particularly sensitive to the engineered ligase. Non-cancerous MCF-10A
mammary epithelial cells were infected with the pBMN-F-TrCP-Shc, pBMN-F-TrCPShc(m) or pBMN-GFP retroviruses. Reduction of endogenous ErbB2 levels was observed,
similar to that observed in SKBR3 and BR474 cells (Fig. 5A). Strikingly, the depletion of
endogenous ErbB RTKs by pBMN-F-TrCP-Shc had little impact on the growth rate of
MCF-10A cells, similar to those infected with pBMN-F-TrCP-Shc(m) or pBMN-GFP (Fig.
5B). Cell cycle arrest or apoptotic induction was not observed in MCF-10A cells stably
expressing F-TrCP-Shc (Fig. 5C–D). It is noteworthy that while EGF stimulates the
proliferation rate of MCF10A (35, 36), ErbB-knockdown by F-TrCP-Shc was carried out
under normal culture conditions in the absence of exogenous EGF. This non-exponential
growth of MCF10A cells is likely less dependent on EGF signaling. Therefore, the
engineered F-TrCP-Shc ligase specifically inhibits the proliferation of ErbB-overexpressing
breast cancer cells, but exerts little effect on non-stimulated mammary epithelial cells. These
results indicate that the simultaneous family-wide targeting of activated ErbB RTKs is a
feasible intervention strategy for breast cancer.
F-TrCP-Shc sensitizes SKBR3 and BT474 cells to cisplatin and inhibits tumorigenicity in
vitro and in vivo

Author Manuscript

Several retrospective studies have suggested that ErbB2 overexpression is associated with a
reduced efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy (37, 38). Therefore, we hypothesized that FTrCP-Shc would render breast cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapy agents. BT474
cells expressing F-TrCP-Shc or F-TrCP-Shc(m) were treated with doses of cisplatin ranging
from 12.5 μM to 100 μM, and cell viability was measured 48 hours after treatment. As
shown in Fig. 6A, F-TrCP-Shc reduced the viability of BT474 cells upon cisplatin treatment.
For example, at 37.5 μM, the number of viable cells is approximately 30% lower than
control BT474 cells infected with pBMN-GFP or pBMN-F-TrCP-Shc(m) (Fig. 6A). A

similar result was observed in BT474 cells (data not shown). In contrast, MCF-10A cells
expressing F-TrCP-Shc did not display enhanced cytotoxicity in response to cisplatin
compared to those expressing F-TrCP-Shc(m) or pBMN-GFP (Fig. 6B).
Next, we assessed the oncogenic potential of F-TrCP-Shc-expressing breast cancer cells by
focus formation assays. Retrovirally-expressed F-TrCP-Shc caused a 50% reduction in focus
formation in both BT474 and SKBR3 cells compared to control pBMN-GFP- and F-TrCPShc(m)-infected cells (Fig. 6C–D and data not shown).

Author Manuscript

To assess whether the targeted degradation of ErbB RTKs by F-TrCP-Shc inhibits the
tumorigenicity of BT474 cells, we subcutaneously injected 7×106 GFP+ BT474 cells
expressing either pBMN-F-TrCP-Shc, pBMN-F-TrCP-Shc(m) or pBMN-GFP into nude
mice. Expretssion of F-TrCP-Shc dramatically attenuated xenograft tumor growth compared
to expression of F-TrCP-Shc(m) or pBMN-GFP (Fig. 7). At week 3, the average tumor
weight of F-TrCP-Shc-expressing BT474 xenografts was 50% less than pBMN-GFP- and FTrCP-Shc(m)-expressing BT474 xenografts (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively) (Fig. 7B).
Collectively, these data indicate that the targeted degradation of activated ErbB family
proteins significantly reduced the oncogenic potential of ErbB2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells, and sensitized those cells to the cisplatin chemotherapeutic agent.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Given the extensive crosstalk among the ErbB RTKs, it is plausible that blocking signaling
from more than one family member may be necessary to effectively eradicate tumors and
limit the occurrence of drug resistance. Currently, there are no effective tools or reagents
available that can simultaneously abrogate the functions of all ErbB RTKs, and no studies
have evaluated whether broad ErbB RTK inactivation preferentially kills tumor versus
normal cells. Moreover, while the complete eradication of ErbB RTK expression is highly
toxic to all cells, selectively targeting the active, tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of ErbB
RTKs may be an effective strategy to preferentially kill tumor cells. However, more refined
tools are required to achieve this delicate selection.

Author Manuscript

Targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation is the primary
mode of regulating the abundance of cellular proteins on the post-transcriptional level. Here,
we showed that fusion of the Shc PTB domain to the βTrCP ubiquitin ligase allows for the
selective recruitment of the activated subpopulations of the ErbB family of RTKs to the SCF
machinery for ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation, and effectively
attenuates MAPK and PI3K signaling. Simultaneous degradation of all activated ErbB
RTKs exerts dramatic cytotoxic effects on ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells by
inducing robust growth inhibition and apoptosis, and enhancing sensitivity to the
chemotherapy drug cisplatin (Figs. 4–5). Our findings are in sharp contrast to ErbB tyrosine
kinase inhibitors that primarily induce cytostatic attenuation of tumor growth (29).
Major inroads for targeted therapy against ErbB2-positive breast cancers were achieved with
the development of trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain
of ErbB2. However, a majority of patients with advanced disease, as well as a proportion of

those receiving treatment for operable disease, experience metastatic progression within one
year of treatment because of the development of resistance to trastuzumab (39–41). One
such mechanism of resistance is the compensatory upregulation of other ErbB RTKs, e.g.
ErbB3, which effectively restores ErbB signaling through the PI3K/Akt axis of signaling
and promotes the survival of tumor cells despite the continued presence of trastuzumab (29)
(42). Moreover, ErbB3 lacks a kinase domain that renders it refractory to small-molecule
inhibitors. Our F-TrCP-Shc construct addresses this particular concern by successfully
targeting activated ErbB3 for proteasomal degradation (Fig. 2A–B).

Author Manuscript

Our engineered F-TrCP-Shc construct has the unique capability of selectively recruiting the
active forms of all ErbB RTKs for degradation (Fig. 2). This unique property allows for the
specific targeting of the oncogenic forms of ErbB RTKs while leaving the native forms
intact. Strikingly, F-TrCP-Shc induced apoptosis, increased cisplatin sensitivity and reduced
the tumorigenicity of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, but demonstrated negligible
toxicity in non-malignant mammary epithelial cells (Figs. 3–5). A somewhat surprising yet
encouraging observation is that other cellular proteins that can interact with the Shc PTB
domain and are theoretically also subjected to ubiquitin-dependent degradation by F-TrCPShc, such as c-Met, were not degraded in ErbB2-overexpressing BT474 cells (Fig. S4). This
finding suggests that the engineered ubiquitin ligase preferentially engages with the active
forms of Shc-binding partners (i.e., the ErbB RTKs). Collectively, our studies suggest that
the perceived adverse effects upon the eradication of all ErbB RTKs can be mitigated by
designing agents that target the activated subpopulations of ErbBs, thereby achieving the
optimal tumoricidal outcome while minimizing the therapy-associated cytotoxic side-effects
to normal cells.

The goal of the present study is to test the engineered ubiquitin ligase strategy for simulating
the consequences of pharmacological eradication of the entire family of activated ErbB
RTKs in ErbB-overexpressing tumor cells, and further assess the impact on non-malignant
mammary epithelial cells. Compared with gene knockout approaches to assess the outcomes
of ErbB RTK ablation, the engineered F-TrCP-Shc ubiquitin ligase is anticipated to more
closely recapitulate the actions of pharmaceutical agents. It reduces but does not completely
eliminate its intended targets, and therefore may not elicit the same severity of consequences
as those that could arise from gene knockout. Moreover, the unique properties of the protein
knockout system in interrogating complex protein functions, including post-translational
modifications, subcellular distributions and functional redundancy, offer a versatile and
powerful investigative tool for the rapid assessment of specific traits in tumorigenesis,
maintenance and resistance to therapy, and inform new and improved therapeutic modalities
against human malignancy. Future studies should directly compare the therapeutic effects of
eradicating a single or multiple ErbB family members in pre-clinical models, and evaluate
the potential of pan-ErbB suppression as a feasible strategy for the development of the next
generation of targeted therapies against ErbB-positive tumors. The engineered ubiquitin
ligase system developed here should be widely applicable to the assessment of protein
families or specific posttranslational modifications as potential new targets for therapeutic
intervention.

Plasmid construction, transfection and retroviral infection
The PTB domain (1–209 aa) and mutant PTB(F198V) from Shc were fused to carboxyl
terminus of FLAG-tagged βTrCP, and the resulting F-TrCP-Shc and F-TrCP-Shc(F198V)
were subcloned into the BamHI/NotI sites of the retroviral pBMN-GFP vector to generate
recombinant retroviruses (43) for infection of SKBR3, BT474 and MCF10A cells, as
detailed in (44). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was carried out to
isolate infected cells, which was based on the expression of GFP from the recombinant
retroviruses. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were carried out as described
(45). F-TrCP-Shc was also subcloned into the pAdTrack-CMV adenoviral vector to generate
recombinant adenoviruses for infection of SKBR3 cells (46).

Cell cycle, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and focus formation assays

Author Manuscript

For cell cycle analysis, cells were incubated with 10 mM BrdU for 30 min at 37°C,
harvested and fixed overnight in 70% ethanol, and analyzed by flow cytometry following
incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU antibodies (BD Pharmingen™ FITC-BrdU Flow
kit, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and counterstaining with PBS containing 10
mg/ml propidium iodide. Cell proliferation rate was determined by plating 2×104 cells and
counting at the indicated time points (Figs. 3B, 4B, and 5D) using an automated cell counter
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and
repeated twice. The results are expressed as the mean ± SD for each set of experiments.

Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V-APC and 7-AAD staining and flow cytometry using
the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). To
measure focus formation, 3.0×103 SKBR3 cells or 6.0×103 BT474 cells were seeded in 6well plates for 10 days, stained with 0.2% crystal violet, and foci were counted. Images of
the colonies were obtained using a NIKON digital camera.
In vitro drug sensitivity assay
BT474 or SKBR3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5,000 cells/well) for 24 hr, treated
with the specified concentrations of cisplatin (Fig. 6A–B) for 48 hr, and cell viability
detected by 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5- [(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2Htetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) using the Cell Prolifereation Kit II (Roche, Indianapolis, IN,
USA).

BT474 tumor xenografts
A single 17 β-estradiol pellet (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) was
implanted subcutaneously into each 6-wk-old female athymic nude mouse (Harlan
Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) 1 day before cell injection. 5×106 BT474 cells were
suspended in Matrigel basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences), and injected
subcutaneously into the right flank. Tumor xenografts were measured with calipers three
times/week and tumor volume was determined using the formula:
