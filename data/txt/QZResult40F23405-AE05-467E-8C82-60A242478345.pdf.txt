BACKGROUND: Imatinib 400 mg daily is the standard treatment for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML). The safety and efficacy of imatinib in CML patients with pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction has not
been analyzed. METHODS: The authors analyzed the outcome of 259 patients with early chronic phase CML treated
with imatinib (starting dose 400 mg in 50, 800 mg in 209). Pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction was seen in 38
(15%) and 11 (4%) patients, respectively. RESULTS: Dose reductions were required in 91 (43%) of 210 patients with
normal organ function, compared with 8 (73%) of 11 (P ¼.065) with renal dysfunction, and 19 (50%) of 38 (P ¼.271)
with liver dysfunction. Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities including anemia (29%, 10%, and 7% of patients with renal
dysfunction, liver dysfunction, and normal organ function, respectively), neutropenia (57%, 30%, and 30%), and
thrombocytopenia (43%, 30%, and 26%) were more frequent in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction treated
with high-dose imatinib. Grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicities were observed at similar frequencies. Complete cytogenetic response rates, event-free survival, and overall survival were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although
patients with pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction might have a higher rate of hematologic toxicity and require
more frequent dose reductions, most patients can be adequately managed, resulting in response rates and survival

Imatinib (STI571, Gleevec) is an orally administered protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, c-kit, platelet-

derived growth factor receptor, and several other kinases .1-3 It is the first small molecule inhibitor of tyrosine kinases to be
licensed for cancer treatment. Imatinib has become the standard treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)4
and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor.5 The standard starting daily dose of imatinib is 400 mg, and higher doses
have been investigated in an effort to improve the response rate.1 In newly diagnosed patients in early chronic phase CML,
imatinib is associated with a complete cytogenetic response rate of 82%, a progression rate to accelerated or blastic phase
of only 7%, a 7-year estimated event-free survival (EFS) rate of 81%, and overall survival (OS) of 86%.6 Imatinib is well
absorbed orally, with nearly 100% bioavailability, and it is mainly metabolized in the liver via the CYP3A4/5 pathway.
The main metabolite, CGP74588, is known to be active, and the elimination of this and other metabolites is >90%
through the bile.7,8
Although imatinib is generally well tolerated, various hematologic and nonhematologic adverse events may occur.
Hematologic adverse events (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) occur most frequently during the first few
months of treatment and are usually transient. The most commonly observed nonhematologic adverse events include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle cramps, fluid retention, skin rash, and fatigue.9-11 Other less common adverse events, such
as liver and kidney toxicity, have also been reported in the literature.3,12,13 Most of these adverse events are grade 1-2, and

they are usually transient and manageable. Permanent discontinuation of imatinib for drug-related adverse events
was reported in <4% of patients after a median follow-up
of 60 months.9,10
Although safety and pharmacokinetic data of imatinib are available for healthy volunteers and cancer patients
with normal liver and/or renal functions,7,8 the safety and
efficacy of imatinib in CML patients with pre-existing
liver and/or renal dysfunction have not been reported, frequently prompting the use of lower starting doses in these
patients. We thus performed this analysis to determine
the safety and efficacy of imatinib among CML patients
with pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
A total of 259 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed
Ph-positive CML in early chronic phase (time from diagnosis to therapy <12 months) were included in 3 consecutive studies. These represent all previously untreated
patients referred to our institution during the study
period. Chronic phase was defined per standard criteria
for tyrosine kinase inhibitor trials as: blasts <15%, basophils <20%, blasts þ promyelocytes <30%, no extramedullary disease, platelets >100  109/L (unless related to
therapy), and no clonal evolution.14,15 Patients were
required to be at least 15 years old and to have adequate
performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group 0-2) and normal cardiac function. Women of
childbearing age were required to have a negative pregnancy test before starting imatinib, and all patients at risk
were required to use contraception during therapy.
Patients provided written informed consent before entry
into the study, which was reviewed and approved by the
institutional review board and performed in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Classification of Renal and Liver Function
Renal and liver functions were classified according to previous publications.16,17 Renal function was based on the
calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl).18 Normal renal
function was defined as CrCl 60 mL/min or higher; mild
dysfunction as CrCl 40-59 mL/min; moderate dysfunction as CrCl 20-39 mL/min; and severe dysfunction as
CrCl less than 20 mL/min. Liver function was classified
according to the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
serum total bilirubin (TB) levels measured within
24 hours before the start of imatinib. Normal was defined

as TB  upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST  ULN;
mild as TB  1.5  ULN and AST>ULN; moderate as
TB 1.5 to 3.0  ULN and AST of any value; and severe as
TB >3  ULN and AST of any value. Dysfunction was
considered regardless of causality, as no pretreatment
biopsies were performed to investigate the possibility of
disease infiltration as a contributor.
Treatment and Dose Modifications
Imatinib was given at a starting dose of 400 mg daily
(n ¼ 50) or 400 mg twice daily (n ¼ 209). Dose reductions of imatinib for hematologic and nonhematologic
toxicities were as follows: for persistent grade 2 nonhematologic drug-related toxic effects, therapy was interrupted
until recovery to grade 1 or less and resumed at the original dose level. If grade 2 toxicity recurred, treatment was
interrupted again until recovery and resumed at 1 dose
level. For grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities, therapy was interrupted until recovery to grade 1 or less and
then resumed at 1 dose level. For severe hematologic
toxicity (neutrophil count of <0.5  109/L or platelet
count of <40  109/L), therapy was interrupted until
neutrophils recovered to 109/L or higher and/or platelets
to 60  109/L or higher. If the toxicity resolved within
2 weeks, treatment was resumed at the original dosage. If
toxicity resolved after >2 weeks, or if it recurred after
resuming therapy, treatment was restarted with a 1 dose
level reduction. Further dose reductions were allowed
using the same guidelines for recurrent hematologic and
nonhematologic toxicity, with the lowest dose allowed
being 300 mg daily.
Monitoring and Assessment of Response
Complete blood counts and serum chemistry were done
weekly during the first 4 weeks of treatment, then every
6 to 8 weeks thereafter. Bone marrow studies, including
morphologic, cytogenetic, or fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, and quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction analysis, were performed every 3 months in
the first year, then every 3 to 6 months thereafter. Patients
were followed for survival at least every 3 months. Drug
safety was evaluated at each visit and graded according to
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria (version 3.0).
Hematologic and cytogenetic response criteria have
been previously described.9,19 Briefly, a complete cytogenetic response rate represents Ph positivity 0%, partial
cytogenetic response represents Ph positivity 1% to 35%,
and minor cytogenetic response represents Ph positivity

3153

Original Article

36%-95%. A major cytogenetic response includes both
complete cytogenetic response and partial cytogenetic
response. Cytogenetic responses were based on the percentage of Phþ metaphases in 20 metaphases.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif), and Statistica 6
software (StatSoft, Tulsa, Okla). The Fisher exact test and
Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare significance
between groups. All reported P values were 2-sided, and P
< .05 was considered statistically significant. Survival was
dated from the start of imatinib therapy until death from
any cause and censored at last follow-up for patients who
were alive. EFS was calculated from the start of imatinib
to loss of complete hematologic response, loss of major
cytogenetic response, transformation to accelerated or
blast phase, or death from any cause. Patients who discontinued for other reasons (eg, noncompliance, financial
issues, lost to follow-up) were censored at date of last
treatment and patients still on treatment at date of last
follow-up.

RESULTS
Study Patients
A total of 259 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed
chronic phase CML were treated with imatinib from
March 2001 to July 2005. The clinical characteristics are
summarized in Table 1. There were no differences in the
baseline characteristics between patients treated with imatinib 400 mg and 800 mg. Eleven patients had renal dysfunction at the start of treatment, which was mild in
9 (82%) and moderate in 2 (18%) patients (Table 1). Of
the 50 patients treated with imatinib 400 mg daily,
4 (8%) had mild renal dysfunction, whereas in the 800
mg daily group, 5 (3%) had mild and 2 (1%) moderate renal dysfunction. Liver dysfunction was present at baseline
in 38 patients, all of them mild. These included 7 (14%)
of the 50 patients treated with standard-dose imatinib and
31 (16%) of the 209 treated with high-dose imatinib. Per
study eligibility criteria, patients with more severe liver
dysfunction were excluded from the studies. Only
1 patient had both renal (moderate) and liver (mild) dysfunction at the start of imatinib treatment. In the
11 patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, 2 (18%)
had low, 8 (73%) had intermediate, and 1 (9%) had high
Sokal risk disease. In the 38 patients with pre-existing liver

dysfunction, 24 (63%) had low, 11 (29%) had intermediate, and 3 (8%) had high Sokal risk disease.20,21
Changes in Kidney and Liver Function After
Imatinib Treatment
Among 50 patients treated with standard dose imatinib, 9
(18%) experienced worsening renal function while on
treatment. All 4 patients with mild renal dysfunction at
the start of treatment developed further worsening in
renal function, as shown by a decrease in CrCl from a
median baseline of 51.5 mL/min (range, 45.4-59.9 mL/
min) to a median of 41.8 mL/min (range, 32.8-47 mL/
min). Three of them maintained a mild dysfunction, and
1 progressed to moderate dysfunction. One patient with
normal renal function (creatinine 0.7 mg/dL and CrCl
93.86 mL/min) experienced severe renal failure (creatinine 8.6 mg/dL and CrCl 8.99 mL/min). Imatinib was
temporarily discontinued in this patient and restarted at a
lower dose once the renal function recovered. Among
patients on high-dose imatinib, 33 (16%) developed transient worsening of renal function. All 7 patients with preexisting renal dysfunction developed further decrease in
their CrCl from a median baseline of 44.4 mL/min

(range, 28.5-57.8 mL/min) to a median of 36.9 mL/min
(range, 13.5-55.8 mL/min). While being treated with
imatinib, 2 of the patients with pre-existing moderate
renal dysfunction (CrCl 28.45 and 34.49 mL/min)
progressed to severe renal dysfunction (CrCl 15.62 and
13.53 mL/min), 1 patient with mild dysfunction progressed to moderate dysfunction, and 4 maintained a mild
dysfunction. The worsening of renal function was usually
transient; temporary discontinuation of imatinib resulted
in recovery of the renal function. All but 1 patient were
able to restart the imatinib at a lower dose without further
decline of their renal function.
Fifteen (30%) patients developed liver toxicity during the treatment with standard-dose imatinib, including
8 (53%) with mild, 5 (33%) with moderate, and 2 (14%)
with severe liver dysfunction. Only 1 of the 7 patients
with pre-existing mild liver dysfunction progressed to
moderate liver dysfunction, 3 maintained a mild dysfunc-

tion, and the liver function of the 3 other patients normalized. In the high-dose group, 36 (17%) patients
developed liver toxicity, including 26 (72%) with mild, 7
(19%) with moderate, and 3 (9%) with severe dysfunction. Only 3 of the 31 patients with mild liver dysfunction
at the baseline experienced worsening of their liver function, 2 to moderate and 1 to severe liver dysfunction. Seventeen of the 31 patients still have persistent mild
dysfunction, whereas the liver function of 11 patients
returned to normal.
Toxicity Profile and Dose Modification
We then analyzed the overall toxicity profile in patients
with or without pre-existing organ dysfunction treated
with standard-dose (Table 2) and high-dose imatinib
(Table 3). With the limitations of the small number of
patients in some subsets, patients with pre-existing renal
dysfunction treated with high-dose imatinib appeared to

This compared with 1 (50%) of the 2 evaluable patient
with pre-existing renal dysfunction and all (100%) of the
4 evaluable patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction
(Table 5). In patients treated with high-dose imatinib, 66
(54%) of the 122 evaluable patients with normal organ
function were still on 800 mg, 33 (27%) were reduced to
600 mg, 20 (16%) were reduced to 400 mg, and 3 (3%)
were reduced to 300 mg at 48 months follow-up. In
patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, 1 (17%) of
the 6 evaluable patients remained at 800 mg, 2 (33%)
were reduced to 600 mg, 2 (33%) were reduced to 400
mg, and 1 (17%) was reduced to 300 mg. In patients with
pre-existing liver dysfunction, 14 (66%) of the 21 evaluable patients remained at 800 mg, 5 (24%) were reduced
to 600 mg, and 2 (10%) were reduced to 400 mg. At 48months follow-up, 3 (27%) patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, 13 (34%) with pre-existing liver dysfunction, and 62 (29%) with normal organ function were
taken off-study for various reasons. The most common
reasons for being off-study were administrative issues
(n ¼ 30), loss of response or disease progression (n ¼ 23),
and liver toxicity (n ¼ 9).
The most common reasons for dose reduction in
patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction were myelosuppression (n ¼ 3), rash (n ¼ 2), liver toxicity (n ¼ 1),
and renal toxicity (n ¼ 1). In the patients with pre-existing
liver dysfunction, the most common reasons for dose
reduction included myelosuppression (n ¼ 5), rash
(n ¼ 4), gastrointestinal toxicity (n ¼ 4), and liver toxicity
(n ¼ 3).

have a higher rate of grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities.
These include anemia (29%, 10%, and 7% in patients
with renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, and normal
organ function, respectively [P ¼ .11]), neutropenia
(57%, 30%, and 30% [P ¼ .31]), and thrombocytopenia
(43%, 30%, and 26% [P ¼ .57]). The frequencies of
other adverse events were rare and did not appear to be
significantly affected by pre-existing organ dysfunction or
imatinib dose.
Transient treatment interruptions and dose reductions were required in patients receiving imatinib therapy
for hematologic or nonhematologic side effects (Table 4).
Dose reductions were necessary in 91 (43%) of 210
patients with normal organ function at the start of imatinib treatment, including 6 (15%) of 39 in the 400-mg
group and 85 (50%) of 171 in the 800-mg group. This
compares to 8 (73%) of 11 (P ¼ .07) patients (2 [50%] of
4 in the 400-mg group and 6 [86%] of 7 in the 800-mg
group) with pre-existing renal dysfunction, and 19 (50%)
of 38 (P ¼ .27) patients (2 [29%] of 7 in the 400-mg
group and 17 [55%] of 31 in the 800-mg group) with
pre-existing liver dysfunction.
In patients treated with imatinib 400 mg daily, 22
of the 26 (85%) evaluable patients with normal organ
function were still on 400 mg at 48 months follow-up.

Responses and Survival
Despite the trend for more treatment interruptions and
dose reductions among patients with pre-existing organ
dysfunctions, the response rate did not differ between
patients with and without organ dysfunction (Table 6). In
patients treated with standard-dose imatinib, the complete cytogenetic response rates were 75% (3 of 4), 71%

CHR, complete hematologic response.

(5 of 7), and 82% (32 of 39) in patients with renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, and normal function, respectively (P ¼ .27). In patients treated with high-dose
imatinib, the complete cytogenetic response rate rates
were 86% (6 of 7), 97% (30 of 31), and 88% (151 of
171), respectively (P ¼ .15).
With a median follow-up of 63 months (range, 2-90
months), 22 patients have died, including 3 (27%) of
11 patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, 1 (3%) of
38 patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, and
18 (9%) of 210 patients with normal organ function. The
causes of death for the 4 patients with baseline organ dysfunction were disease progression, ovarian cancer, cardiac
event, and unknown cause, respectively. The estimated
5-year OS was 80% for those with renal dysfunction,
97% for those with liver dysfunction, and 91% for those
with normal organ function (P ¼ 0.3) (Fig. 1). EFS was
also similar within the 3 groups of patients, with 5-year
estimates of 80%, 82%, and 82%, respectively (P ¼ .94).
The Sokal risk score did not correlate with either OS
(P ¼ .96) or EFS (P ¼ .18). There was no difference in the
OS and EFS among the 3 groups of patients, regardless of
the imatinib starting dose.

DISCUSSION
Although it is well known that imatinib is overall well tolerated, currently available data only refer to patients with
normal organ functions. However, occasionally patients
with CML present with pre-existing conditions that cause
renal or liver dysfunctions. The safety and efficacy of imatinib in such patients has not been previously reported.
These patients may sometimes be offered other therapies
or a lower starting dose because of the lack of published
information. Recently, 2 phase 1 and pharmacokinetic
studies of imatinib were performed by the National

adverse events were more common in the group with renal
dysfunction, but there was no correlation between dose
and serious adverse events in any group. In these studies,
daily imatinib doses up to 800 mg were well tolerated by
many patients with mild and moderate renal dysfunction
despite increased imatinib exposure. Imatinib exposure
did not differ between patients with and without liver dysfunction. The maximal recommended dose of imatinib
for patients with mild liver dysfunction was 500 mg daily,
whereas dosing guidelines for patients with moderate and
severe liver dysfunction remained undetermined based on
these studies.16,17
To further investigate the safety and effectiveness of
imatinib in CML patients with pre-existing liver and/or
renal dysfunction, we analyzed the outcome of 259
patients with early chronic phase CML treated at our
institution with imatinib either at standard (400 mg daily)
or high dose (800 mg daily). Among the 259 patients
included in the analysis, 4% had pre-existing mild or
moderate renal dysfunction, and 14% had mild liver
dysfunction.
According to our results, imatinib is similarly effective among patients with or without pre-existing liver
and/or renal dysfunction; this is also reflected in a similar
OS and EFS. The toxicity profile also appears similar for
patients with or without organ dysfunctions, with the possible exception of myelosuppression, which appears to be
more frequent among patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction treated with high-dose imatinib. The incidence
of most nonhematologic toxicities did not appear significantly different regardless of the dose, with the limitations
of small subsets for this analysis. These results are in agreement with the reports from Gibbons et al.16 and Ramanathan et al.17 showing overall good tolerance to treatment
of solid tumors among patients with pre-existing liver
and/or renal dysfunction.
Of particular interest is assessment of whether the
liver and/or renal functions further deteriorate during
therapy, because imatinib has been reported to cause both
renal and liver toxicity.10,22 Renal dysfunction indeed
deteriorated in all 11 patients who started therapy with
mild or moderate renal dysfunction. This is in contrast to
patients who started therapy with normal renal function,
of whom only 12% (31 of 248) developed renal dysfunction. Deterioration of renal function among patients with
pre-existing renal dysfunction was fortunately transient
and could be managed with dose adjustments, with no
patients requiring dialysis. Worsening of liver function
was less common, with only 3 of the 38 patients with pre-

3158

existing liver dysfunction experiencing deterioration of
their liver function during treatment.
The lack of impact of Sokal risk score on the longterm outcome is indeed interesting, but the cause for this
is not clear from this analysis. It has been previously
reported from the International Randomized Study of
Interferon Versus STI571 trial that patients who
achieved a complete cytogenetic response have a similar
long-term outcome regardless of their pretreatment
Sokal score.11 It is possible that the use of high-dose imatinib may have improved the response rate among this
patient population to dilute the effect of the Sokal score.
Exploring the reason for this phenomenon is an important research question, but we believe it is beyond the
scope of this analysis.
It is important to emphasize the retrospective nature
of this analysis, which could affect some of the conclusions. However, even when the analysis is retrospective,
patients were treated in prospective studies, and data collection was in real time. It should also be emphasized that
because these patients were treated in clinical trials, there
was very close follow-up of all patients, with frequent
monitoring of efficacy and safety.
We conclude that imatinib is an effective therapy for
patients with CML who present with pre-existing liver
and/or renal dysfunction. There might be an increased
risk for worsening renal function among patients with
pre-existing renal dysfunction, and a higher risk of other
toxicities, particularly myelosuppression for patients
treated with higher doses. Nonetheless, most patients
with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, and to some
extent those with renal dysfunction, can be safely offered
therapy with standard-dose imatinib.
