BACKGROUND: With the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide, the management of acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL) has changed dramatically. We performed a population-based study of APL in the United States to determine its incidence and
relative survival (RS) during a 34-year period. METHODS: We identified 1397 patients diagnosed with APL between 1975 and 2008 in
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patients were categorized into 4 age groups and 3 calendar periods. As a
comparison, we also reviewed the outcome of APL patients treated at our institution during approximately the same time interval.
RESULTS: The incidences of APL increased with time period and patient age. Short- and long-term RS improved with each calendar
period, with the greatest improvement occurring between 1991 and 1999; 5-year RS rates were 0.18 for patients diagnosed in 19751990, 0.52 in 1991-1999, and 0.64 in 2000-2008. Age was an important predictor of survival. For example, the 5-year RS rate in
patients diagnosed in 2000-2008 was 0.38 for patients aged 60 years and 0.73 and 0.75 for patients aged <20 years and 20-39
years, respectively. Similar treads of improvements in the survival were observed in APL patients treated at our institution. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of APL has increased, especially in the last decade. Clinical outcome improved remarkably in patients with APL

INTRODUCTION
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) accounts for 10%-15% of adult acute myeloid leukemias,1 with an incidence of
600-800 cases each year in the United States (US).2 APL is an important model for cancer therapy because it is the first
neoplasm to have been effectively treated with a molecularly targeted drug, representing a change of paradigm in the treatment of cancer.3-7
For many years, APL had a dismal prognosis with a high rate of early mortality due to hemorrhage from coagulopathy, which often worsened during chemotherapy. In the 1970s, anthracycline-based therapies produced complete remission in 65%-80% of patients with APL and long-term survival in 15%-25% of patients.8-10 The introduction of all-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA) in 1985,11 the first successful agent specifically targeting the PML-RARA oncogene, dramatically
changed the management of APL. The clinical discovery of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in 1992 has been viewed as a second
milestone in the treatment of APL.12-15
In the US, anthracyclines were introduced for APL treatment in the 1970s and were the standard therapy during the
1980s. Treatment of APL with ATRA was first introduced in the US in June 1990,16,17 and ATO treatment was introduced in October 1997.1,18 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ATRA for the treatment of patients
with APL in November 199519 and ATO for relapsed and refractory APL in September 2000.20 To evaluate the potential
impact of introduction of ATRA and ATO on relative survival (RS), we used the years 1991 and 2000 as cutoff points.
The aim of this study was to examine trends in short- and long-term survival of patients with APL before and after the
introduction of molecularly targeted therapy and the incidence of APL in the US. We also examined the outcome of the
patients treated in a tertiary referral center over approximately the same time interval to further confirm the potential
impact of ATRA and ATO on survival in APL observed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS

San Francisco-Oakland (California), Seattle-Puget Sound
(Washington), and Utah. To assess any possible impact of
stem cell transplantation (SCT) on survival in APL, data
from the Center for International Blood and Marrow
Transplant Research (CIBMTR) were used to identify
prescription patterns of SCT performed in patients with
APL in the US during the study period.21 SCT was not
performed in patients with APL in the US before 1980.
From 1980 to 2008, a total of 1062 transplantations were
reported to the CIBMTR: 392 autologous and 670 allogeneic (455 from sibling donors and 215 from unrelated
donors). The numbers of allogeneic SCTs for APL in the
periods 1975-1990, 1991-1999, and 2000-2008 in the
US were 120, 320, and 230, respectively.
The SEER database included 1397 patients with a
diagnosis of APL as the first cancer between 1975 and
2008 who were followed for status until the end of 2008.
We used the third edition of the International Classification of Disease for Oncology histology code 9866 to identify all patients with APL. For incidence rate calculations,
all patients with APL were included. In 150 patients, APL
was not the first cancer; 12 patients were reported by autopsy or death certificate, and 8 cases were without active
follow-up. The remaining 1227 patients were included in
our survival analysis.

APL Treatment at The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center from 1980 to 2008

To further confirm the potential impact of ATRA and
ATO on survival in APL observed in the SEER population-based study, we examined the data on patients
treated at our institution during approximately the same
time period as the SEER group. Two hundred fortytwo patients with newly diagnosed APL were treated at
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
between 1980 and 2008. Their median age was 42 years
(range, 13-81 years). During 1980-1990, 70 APL
patients received treatment on front line protocols, usually consisting of a combination of an anthracycline and
cytarabine. The clinical studies with ATRA began in
September 1991, and between 1991 and 2001, 87
patients with newly diagnosed APL were enrolled in
clinical trials with ATRA and idarubicin-based regimens, including 21 patients who were treated with
ATRA and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO). Thereafter,
from 2002 to 2008, a combination of ATRA and ATO
(GO) was evaluated in 85 patients with APL to
explore the potential for replacing traditional cytotoxic
chemotherapy for the disease.

Data Analysis

Patient characteristics were summarized using descriptive
statistics, and categorical variables were compared using
the chi-square test for continuous variables. Age-adjusted
incidence rate was expressed per 100,000 persons per
year.
RS is defined as the ratio of observed survival in a
population of cancer patients to the expected or background survival in a comparable set of cancer-free individuals.22 Expected survival was obtained from the expected
survival table by matching the cohort cases by age, sex,
race, and date at which the age was coded. RS is a robust
method of cause-specific survival analysis typically used in
the analysis of cancer registry data. The advantage of using
RS is that the cause of death need not be accurate. RS thus
provides a way to accurately measure the survival rate associated with the cancer in question, regardless of whether
the excess mortality (ie, the higher number of deaths or
rate of death in the cancer population) is due to cancer or
noncancer deaths. As a result, our RS calculations captured excess mortality resulting from, for example, infection or other events related to APL. One-, 5-, and 10-year
RS were expressed as ratios of patients with APL who survived it at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Overall survival
(OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were defined according
to International Working Group criteria.23 We analyzed
RS, OS, and EFS using the Kaplan-Meier method.24,25
SEER*Stat 7.0.4 statistical software and SPSS 16.0 software were used for data analysis.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and APL Incidence

We identified 1397 patients with APL from the SEER
database (697 male, 700 female) with a median age of 48
years (range, 0-98 years; Table 1). One hundred fortynine patients (11%) were <20 years of age; 449 patients
(32%) were 60 years of age. Most patients (83%) were
white.
The incidence of APL increased significantly with
each calendar period from 0.11 per 100,000 persons in
1975-1990 to 0.27 in 2000-2008 (P<.05; Table 1). A
statistically significant linear increase in incidence was
observed across all 3 study calendar periods (P<.05). The
increase of APL incidence was similar in different age
groups (data not shown). The overall annual age-adjusted
incidence of APL during 1975-2008 was 0.18 per
100,000 (incidence was 0.17 per 100,000 in women and
0.19 in men). The incidence was 0.06 per 100,000 among
those aged 20 years, but increased to 0.36 among those
aged 60 years. Among racial groups, the incidence of

Survival

RS for the entire cohort of patients with APL increased
significantly with each calendar period during the study
period, with the major improvement in survival occurring
among patients diagnosed in 1991-1999 (Figure 1A).
Five-year RS was 0.18 in the calendar period 1975-1990
and 0.52 and 0.64 in the calendar periods 1991-1999 and
2000-2008, respectively (Figure 1A, Table 2); that is,
excess mortality due to APL within 5 years of diagnosis
was as high as 82% in 1975-1990 but as low as 36% in
2000-2008 compared with cancer-free individuals.
Throughout all calendar periods, age was a strong
predictor of long-term survival, with 1- and 5-year RS
decreasing sharply for patients aged 60 years (Table 2).
RS increased with calendar period in all age groups (Figure 2). Patients diagnosed in the last calendar period had
the highest rates of RS among all age groups. Among the

70) in 1980-1990 (P<.001) (Figure 1B). A similar pattern was noted when analyzing EFS (Figure 1C).
Between the first and last calendar periods under
study (Figure 3, Table 3), 5-year RS increased from 0.22
to 0.73 for patients aged 20 years, from 0.27 to 0.75 for
patients aged 20-39 years, from 0.20 to 0.69 for patients
aged 40-59 years, and from 0.07 to 0.38 for patients aged
60 years. One- and 10-year RS results showed similar
trends (Table 3; Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we noted a significant improvement in RS
starting in 1991 (Figure 1 and Table 2). Several factors
may have contributed to the observed improved clinical
outcome in the latter calendar periods of study. These
include better supportive care and increased use of anthracycline-based regimens, but most importantly the discovery and use of ATRA and ATO. Although the number of
patients who underwent allogeneic SCT increased during
this calendar period, this is unlikely to have a major role in
the improvement, because the number of patients with
APL who received allogeneic SCT was very small. It is also
widely accepted that allogeneic SCT has a limited effect
on the outcome of patients with acute myelogenous leuke5814

mia and favorable-risk cytogenetic in first remission,
including those with APL.26
A dramatic improvement in survival for all age
groups was observed in the calendar period 1991-1999.
The 5-and 10-year RS rates for patients aged 40 years at
diagnosis more than doubled in comparison to those in
the previous calendar period (Figures 1 and 3, Table 3).
Although the observed improvement could be partially
due to better supportive care, this dramatic change in outcome can be clearly attributed to the increased use of
ATRA. In the US, treatment of APL with ATRA was first
introduced in June 1990.16,17 Subsequently, the US Intergroup study, a multicenter clinical trial in 350 patients
with newly diagnosed APL, was conducted during 19921995. Between June 1991 and November 1995, more
than 1,500 patients with APL received ATRA on a compassionate-use basis.19 That is, at least 43% of the total
number of patients with newly diagnosed APL in the US
was treated with ATRA during this period. The high
response rates reported in the clinical trials of ATRA in
patients with APL led to its approval for the treatment of
APL by the FDA.19 Subsequently, ATRA plus chemotherapy with daunorubicin (or idarubicin) and cytarabine
became the standard induction regimen for this disease.9,27,28 Following the successful treatment of APL

with ATO in China, a US pilot study was conducted in
12 patients with relapsed APL in October 1997,1,18 and
the first US multicenter trial was conducted in 40 patients
with relapsed APL in 1998-1999.29 Soon after, the FDA
approved ATO for relapsed and refractory APL in September 2000,20 so although its effect on survival during
the calendar period prior to the year 2000 cannot be
excluded, it is expected to be limited.

The findings in the SEER population-based study
are in line with those for the MD Anderson study group.
During 1991-2001, 87 patients with newly diagnosed
APL were treated with ATRA plus idarubicin at MD
Anderson. OS was significantly increased over that in the
70 patients with APL treated without ATRA in 19801990 (P<.001; Figure 1B).Therefore, the introduction of
ATRA clearly contributed to the observed overall RS of

0.65 at 1 year and 0.52 at 5 years for patients treated during the same period (1991-1999) in the SEER population-based study.
Recent studies have suggested that ATO is more
effective than ATRA in eradicating leukemic stem cells.30
Clinical trials have demonstrated that single-agent ATO
can induce durable remissions in patients with previously
untreated APL,31,32 and the addition of ATO to standard
induction and consolidation therapies may improve clinical outcomes in adults with newly diagnosed APL.27,33,34
In the present study, we observed improvement in RS in
the last calendar period; overall RS increased from 0.52 in
1991-1999 to 0.64 in 2000-2008 (Table 2). Our findings
in a population-based study are in accordance with results
of the North American Leukemia Intergroup Study
C9710.27 In this randomized trial of 481 patients with
previously untreated APL from 1999 to 2005, it was
reported that 3-year OS was better for patients assigned to
receive an ATO-containing regimen than for those
assigned to a regimen of ATRA in combination with daunorubicin for consolidation (86% versus 81%; P ¼ 0.06).
The observed improvement in RS in this latest calendar
period is also likely to be due to a more widespread use of
ATO for relapsed APL resulting in the improved RS in
relapsed patients. However, other potential factors that
may have contributed to this improvement include
improvement of supportive care measures as well as
increased knowledge and experience of teams who care for
patients with APL, and more widespread use of ATRA for
5816

maintenance therapy. Early detection of relapse through
monitoring for the fusion transcript PML-RARA using
polymerase chain reaction, and prompt initiation of therapy with ATO for relapsed patients also have some effect.
Furthermore, our observations in the SEER populationbased study are consistent with the results from an MD
Anderson trial of ATO in combination with ATRA
(GO) in 85 newly diagnosed patients with APL treated
between 2002 and 2008, suggesting that such a combination may improve OS compared with ATRA plus idarubicin or GO (n ¼ 87) during the period 1991- 2001
(P<.001; Figure 1B),34 although part of this improvement must be attributed to better overall care of the
patients.
All patients with available long-term follow-up data
for our population-based study were obtained from SEER
registries with no selection biases. Limitations of the
SEER database include a lack of treatment information
for individual patients. It is impossible to know whether
or not the patients received chemotherapy and/or other
agents; therefore, the proportion of patients who actually
received various treatments, and more specifically ATRA
and ATO, is unknown. Clearly, the conclusions of this
study are based on the assumption of changing patterns of
treatment with the FDA approval of ATRA and ATO in
the US, and availability of data from related publications.
However, the inclusion of the single-institution data
serves to confirm that these patterns may well reflect the
actual practice and that the improved outcomes are clearly
related to the changed practice.
We also observed that the incidence of APL has
increased in the US over the past several decades. The incidence rate was 0.27 per 100,000 in 2000-2008 compared
with 0.11 in 1975-1990, and 0.06 in the population aged
20 years compared with 0.36 per 100,000 among those
aged 60 years in the latter period (Table 1). Similar incidence rates of 0.16 in 1992-1995, 0.22 in 1996-2001,
and 0.28 in 2002-2007 were reported in another recent
report.35 The reasons behind this apparent increase are
unclear. Although the use of better diagnostic tools (eg,
molecular techniques) may have increased the diagnostic
accuracy over the years, this is unlikely to be the sole explanation for the increased incidence, because APL can be
diagnosed reliably by the presence of typical presenting
features, distinctive bone marrow morphology, and chromosome abnormality.
In conclusion, in this large population-based study
of 1397 patients diagnosed with APL between 1975 and
2008, we found that the incidence of APL increased over
time, especially in the last decade; the RS of patients with
Cancer

APL increased, with the most improvement occurring in
1991-1999 for all age groups, presumably because of
increased use of the molecularly targeted agent ATRA.
Future studies with longer observation periods are needed
to evaluate the impact of the introduction of ATO and its
inclusion earlier in the course of treatment on outcomes
in APL. The combination of ATRA and ATO has shown
the potential to eliminate standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for APL.36,37 ATO alone or in combination with
ATRA is an excellent option for older patients, who often
cannot tolerate anthracycline-based therapy.31-33,38-40 It
will also be interesting to see the impact of ATO on the
survival of this particular population in the future.
