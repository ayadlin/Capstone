BACKGROUND. The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay has been reported to
accurately predict the risk of disease recurrence and chemotherapy benefit in
women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, lymph node (LN)-negative breast
cancer who are treated with tamoxifen. To the authors’ knowledge, the association between the RS and clinicopathologic characteristics has been studied in
randomized and case-control trials, but not in the general population.

METHODS. The authors analyzed the correlation between clinicopathologic breast
cancer characteristics and RS among 300 consecutive Israeli patients who were
referred to undergo the test between October 2004 and October 2006.

RESULTS. Low, intermediate, and high RS were noted in 109 patients (36%), 134

was 54 years and the median tumor size was 1.6 cm. High tumor grade, low prosion were found to be associated with a high RS, whereas patient age, tumor size,
ER expression, and lymph node micrometastasis were found to correlate poorly
with the RS. The ability of any of these variables, either alone or in combination,
to predict the RS was limited. Similarly, neither commonly used guidelines nor the
Adjuvant! Online software were found to be able to predict the RS.

CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study suggest that neither standard clinicopathologic features nor commonly used assessment tools can reliably predict
the RS among referred breast cancer patients compared with a clinical trial population. These data also may indicate the need for additional studies regarding the
role of the RS among certain subsets of breast cancer patients, including those
with noninfiltrating ductal carcinoma histology and the presence of lymph node
micrometastasis. Cancer 2008;112:731–6.  2007 American Cancer Society.

reater than 50% of women diagnosed with breast cancer have
lymph node-negative, hormone receptor-positive disease.1
When treated with tamoxifen, the 5-year recurrence rate among
these patients is <20%, and the addition of chemotherapy reduces
the recurrence risk by only an additional 2% to 10%.2 The ability to
predict which patients will benefit from the addition of chemotherapy is limited and the decision to administer chemotherapy is
currently based on clinical and pathologic parameters, including
patient age and tumor size, grade, and histology. Several clinical
guidelines and Internet-based algorithms use these parameters to

predict the risk of recurrence and estimate the relative benefit of chemotherapy. However, these tools
tend to recommend chemotherapy for a large proportion of patients.3–6
Recent advancements in the understanding of
the molecular basis of breast cancer have led to the
development of several gene expression analyses,
which aim to predict prognosis as well as response
to chemotherapy among breast cancer patients.7–17
It is interesting to note that although using different
analyses methods and gene sets, 4 different tests
demonstrated significant agreement with regard to
outcome prediction.18 The 21-gene recurrence score
(RS), also known as Oncotype DX, has been tested
in several clinical trials for its ability to predict
prognosis and response to therapy among patients
with early breast cancer.12 The study is performed
by measuring the expression of 16 cancer-related
genes and 5 housekeeping genes in paraffin-embedded tumor tissues and using a specific algorithm to
analyze the expression data and generate the RS.
The RS is currently used only in patients with lymph
node-negative, hormone receptor- positive breast
cancer and its ability to predict prognosis or
response to chemotherapy has to our knowledge
been tested in 4 independent studies to date.12,19–21
In a study of 688 patients with lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer
who were treated with tamoxifen in the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)
clinical trial B-14, the RS was found to be a strong
and independent prognostic factor, either as a continuous function or when grouped into 3 categories
of low (<18), intermediate (18–30), or high (31)
risk.12 A study of patients enrolled in the NSABPB20 trial identified the RS not only as a prognostic
factor but also as a reliable predictor of chemotherapy benefit.19 The RS also was found to be associated with the risk of breast cancer death in a
retrospective, population-based study of 770 breast
cancer patients.20 It is interesting to note that a
smaller study failed to identify any association
between the RS and breast cancer recurrence.21 A
recent economic analysis suggests that the use of
the RS can save considerable costs.22
To our knowledge to date, the association
between the RS and various clinical and pathologic
characteristics has not been tested in the general
population of patients who are referred to undergo
the test. However, these patients may vary considerably from those recruited to the NSABP trials. For
example, physicians may recommend the test only
for those patients whom they consider to be of particularly low risk for disease recurrence.

In the current study, we analyzed the correlation
between standard clinical and pathologic breast
cancer characteristics and the RS in a cohort of 300
consecutive Israeli breast cancer patients. In addition,
risk stratification of these patients according to the RS
was compared with commonly used guidelines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study population included all Israeli, newly
diagnosed, female breast cancer patients who were
referred to the RS assay between October 2004 and October 2006. Two male breast cancer patients who underwent the test were excluded from the current analysis.
The test was performed among patients with lymph
node-negative, ER-positive disease. HER-2 overexpression and lymph node micrometastases (2 mm) were
allowed. Clinical and pathologic data were collected at
the time of referral. Pathologic examination was conducted at the pathology departments of the referring
centers. The RS assay (Oncotype DX) was performed on
paraffin-embedded tumor samples at Genomic Health
Laboratories, as previously described.12
All pathologic reports were reviewed for the current analysis and data regarding tumor histology,
tumor grade, hormone receptor status, and HER-2
expression were recorded. Data also were analyzed
using 3 clinical tools aimed at assessing the need for
chemotherapy: the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) clinical practice guidelines,3 the
2005 St. Gallen recommendations,4 and the Adjuvant!
Online website.5 The Adjuvant! Online analysis was
calculated for the 10-year survival benefit from
hormonal therapy and from cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) combination-like
protocols, which are currently recommended for
patients with lymph node-negative disease.3
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of the Chaim Sheba Medical Center.
The study variables were compared between the
study groups using Student t tests for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categoric variables.
The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to
determine the correlation between continuous variables. All significance tests were 2-tailed. All calculations and statistical tests were performed using the
SAS software package (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Between October 2004 and October 2006, 308 Israeli
breast cancer patients were referred to undergo the
RS assay by 70 different physicians from all major
Israeli oncology clinics (16 institutions). The test was
cancelled in 8 patients (2.6%) because of insufficient

RNA, <5% invasive tumor in the sample, or no ER
expression as determined by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The vast majority of the patients (87%) underwent the test between
November 2005 and October 2006. Based on breast
cancer incidence data from the Israeli health ministry
(available at URL: http://www.health.gov.il/ Accessed
April 2007), this population was estimated to be 25%
of all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with
hormone receptor-positive, lymph node-negative
disease who were diagnosed at that time.
Based on the previously defined risk categories,12
the patients were divided into 3 risk groups. Low-risk
(RS of <18), intermediate-risk (RS of 18–30), and
high-risk (RS of 31) scores were noted in 109
patients (36%), 134 patients (45%), and 57 patients
(19%), respectively. Similar age distribution was
noted in all risk groups (Table 1) and no correlation
was noted between age and the RS value (Fig. 1A).
Although significantly larger tumors were observed
in the high-risk group, the absolute difference

between the groups was found to be of no clinical
significance (1.8 cm in the high-risk group vs 1.6 cm
in the remainder of the patients). Similarly, the correlation between tumor size and the RS value was
found to be statistically significant (P < .0001) but
weak (r 5 0.2) (Fig. 1B).
Noninfiltrating ductal carcinoma (non-IDC)
histologies, comprised mainly of infiltrating lobular
carcinoma (ILC) histology, were found to be significantly less prevalent among the high-risk patients and
were noted in only 6% of these patients, compared
with 23% among patients in the low-risk category.
Different distribution patterns were noted for the ER
and progesterone receptor (PR) status. Although similar ER intensities were noted in all the study groups,
negative PR staining was found to be significantly correlated with increased risk and was observed in 11%,
25%, and 51% of the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and
high-risk groups, respectively (P < .0001).
We analyzed the ability of standard features to
predict RS categorization, and noted a non-IDC his-

tology in only 3 of the high-risk RS patients (6%)
compared with 25 (23%) and 14 (11%), respectively,
of the low-risk and intermediate-risk RS patients.
Moreover, 95 of the 101 (94%) PR-positive and grade
1 or 2 samples were found to have a low-risk or intermediate-risk RS (based on the modified BloomRichardson grading criteria).
The RS assay is not indicated for patients with
lymph node-positive disease and the test is usually

not performed in patients with HER-2-positive
tumors. However, 14 of the patients had HER-2 overexpression and 20 had lymph node micrometastasis.
Although HER-2 was found to be significantly more
common in the high-risk group compared with the
low-risk and intermediate-risk groups (16% vs 2%;
P 5 .0001), the prevalence of lymph node micrometastasis was found to be similar in all risk categories.
Three commonly used decision tools aimed at either predicting risk or estimating the need for chemotherapy are the NCCN and St. Gallen guidelines and
the Adjuvant! Online software.4–6 We compared the
recommendations or risk stratifications derived from
these tools with the RS risk stratification (Table 2). No
correlation was found between the NCCN guidelines
and the RS risk categorization. According to the NCCN
guidelines, chemotherapy should be either considered
or given to all the high-risk RS patients, but also to
>90% of the patients in the low-risk and intermediaterisk groups. According to the 2005 St. Gallen guidelines, all patients with hormone receptor-positive,
lymph node-negative disease are classified as either
low risk (no chemotherapy needed) or intermediate
risk (chemotherapy should be considered). The vast
majority of the high-risk RS patients (98%) were classified as being at average risk by the St. Gallen guidelines. However, although the stratification according to
the St. Gallen guidelines significantly differed between
the RS groups (P < .001), 66% of the low-risk and 82%
of the intermediate-risk RS patients were classified as
being at average risk. Comparison of the RS risk
stratification with the benefit of hormonal therapy as
predicted by the Adjuvant! Online program demonstrated a significant correlation between the 2 (Table 2)

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we report on the correlation
between standard clinicopathologic features and the
21-gene RS among 300 consecutive Israeli breast
cancer patients who were referred to undergo the
assay by their physicians. Because previous studies
analyzed the RS in archived tissues,12,19,20 the current
study findings may better reflect the real-life correlation between clinicopathologic features and the RS.
An important finding noted in the current study
cohort is the different risk stratification of our
patients compared with previously published studies.
Although 36% of our patients were considered to be
at low risk, 45% at intermediate risk, and 19% at high
risk, the distribution was 54%, 21%, and 25%, respectively, in the chemotherapy validation study.19 This
difference most likely stems from the tendency of
physicians not to refer patients who, based on standard features, are considered to be at either low or
high risk. Because the management of patients with
an intermediate-risk RS is currently uncertain, the

735

proper RS-based management of nearly half of the
referred Israeli patients awaits the results of additional prospective clinical trials.
As previously reported, several standard pathologic features, including tumor grade and PR staining, appear to correlate with the RS. Surprisingly, no
association was noted between the RS and patient
age or ER intensity and only a modest association
was noted between the RS and tumor size. These
findings are different from those of previous
reports.12,19,20 Although a lack of association between
the RS and ER intensity may reflect variability in the
staining procedures among different pathology laboratories, the lack of an association between the RS
and both patient age and tumor size may reflect true
differences between the populations. It remains to be
elucidated whether these differences between the
referred and the validation patient populations will
translate into differences in the predictive ability of
the RS or the interpretation of the test results.
To our knowledge, the current study is the first
to report a possible association between 3 pathologic
characteristics, namely HER-2 expression, histology,
and lymph node micrometastases, and the RS. A
strong association was noted between HER-2 expression and high RS. Although to our knowledge this
finding has not been reported previously, it is not
surprising because of the high weight given to HER-2
expression in the RS algorithm.12 Because only 14
patients with HER-2 expression were included in the
current study cohort, the association between HER-2
expression and RS needs to be validated further. We
noticed an association between non-IDC histology,
mostly ILC, and a low RS. Despite having a prognosis
that is similar to IDC, ILC tumors tend to have different biologic characteristics, including higher ER and
PR expression, and lower rates of proliferation and
HER-2 expression.23 Because the RS is based on
these features, a lower score is expected to be found
in ILC tumors compared with IDC tumors, regardless
of prognosis or response to chemotherapy. Thus, our
data suggest that the prognostic and predictive roles
of the RS should be validated separately in ILC and
IDC cases and, possibly, a different algorithm or risk
stratification should be used for the categorization of
patients with ILC. It is interesting to note that no
association was noted between the RS and the presence of lymph node micrometastases. Thus, a high
score was noted in only 1 of 20 patients with micrometastases. This finding obviates the need to further
study the role of the RS in patients with lymph node
micrometastases.
It has been suggested that standard pathologic
features may be used to predict the RS. Indeed, in

736

CANCER

the Israeli population, tumors that were found to
stain for PR and had a low or intermediate tumor
grade were found to have a 95% chance of not being
classified as high risk. However, the analysis is based
on only 57 patients who were classified as high risk
in this cohort and these results should be interpreted
with caution. Moreover, none of the standard features were able to differentiate between low-risk and
intermediate-risk categorization. Thus, the use of
standard pathologic features as an alternative to the
RS cannot be justified according to our data.
Both the NCCN guidelines and the St. Gallen
recommendations could not accurately predict the
RS. Moreover, the use of the RS could eliminate the
use of chemotherapy in a large proportion of those
patients who, according to these guidelines, would
be assigned to receive such therapy. A significant
association was identified between the RS and hormonal therapy benefit, as predicted by Adjuvant!
Online. However, despite being validated in a population-based study,6 no association was found
between chemotherapy benefit, as predicted by Adjuvant! Online, and the RS.
To our knowledge, the current study is the first
to report on RS distribution and its association with
standard clinicopathologic features in a cohort of
consecutively referred breast cancer patients. The
data indicate that none of the standard clinicopathologic features or currently used predictive tools can
accurately predict the RS. The observed discrepancies between these commonly used prediction methods emphasize the importance of prospective
evaluation and comparison before their acceptance
as valid clinical tools. Our data also indicate differences between the referred patients and the population described in the validation studies. The meaning
of these differences remains to be elucidated.
