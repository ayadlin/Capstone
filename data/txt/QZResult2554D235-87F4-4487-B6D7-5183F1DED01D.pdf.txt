Prognostic Significance of Angiogenesis and
Angiogenic Growth Factors in Nonsmall Cell
Lung Cancer
Ravi Salgia, MD, PhD

Currently, nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Angiogenesis, the formation of new vasculature, is a complex and tightly regulated process that promotes metastasis and
disease progression in lung cancer and other malignancies. Developmental antiangiogenic agents have shown activity
in NSCLC, and bevacizumab, an antiangiogenic monoclonal antibody, is approved for the treatment of patients with
advanced disease. However, predictive biomarkers are needed to guide the administration of antiangiogenic agents.
It is possible that angiogenic molecules could accurately predict patient response to targeted antiangiogenic therapies, which would allow individualized and perhaps more effective treatment. Angiogenic signaling molecules may
also have value as prognostic indicators, which may be useful for the management of NSCLC. Here the author provides an overview of angiogenic molecules currently being investigated as prognostic biomarkers in NSCLC and disC 2011 American Cancer Society.

Nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung carcinoma and accounts for at least 85% of all

lung cancer cases in the United States.1 Treatment options for NSCLC have included surgery, radiation, and single-agent
or platinum-based doublet chemotherapy; more recently, targeted agents have been incorporated into treatment algorithms.2 Current targeted therapy for NSCLC is limited to inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/
human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (HER1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Bevacizumab (Avastin;
Genentech; South San Francisco, Calif), a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF, is the only approved antiangiogenic
agent for NSCLC. Bevacizumab, in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel , was approved in 2006 by the US Food and
Drug Administration as a first-line treatment for patients with nonsquamous advanced, recurrent, or metastatic NSCLC.3
Cell-surface receptors and several pro- and anti-angiogenic factors mediate the complex process of angiogenesis,
which results in the formation of new vasculature.4,5 There is considerable evidence associating angiogenesis with tumor
growth and metastasis, and efforts are ongoing to identify angiogenic biomarkers to aid in NSCLC management.4,6 Biomarkers are indicators of a clinical process, event, or condition and are categorized according to their specific purpose.6
Whereas prognostic biomarkers provide information about overall patient outcome, regardless of therapy, predictive biomarkers provide information about potential therapeutic benefit.6 Others include pharmacodynamic, toxicity, and resistance biomarkers.6 Although angiogenic biomarkers in NSCLC are not yet validated or used in clinical practice, several
measures and mediators of angiogenesis are under investigation.7-9 Predictive/prognostic biomarkers are currently needed
to guide the personalized use of antiangiogenic agents for NSCLC, currently selected by exclusion only (bevacizumab is
not recommended for patients with hemorrhage or recurrent hemoptysis). Prognostic biomarkers may also be useful for
weighing the benefits of continuing treatment against associated toxicities. Presented here is a review of angiogenic factors

NSCLC; however, at present, there are many outstanding
questions regarding its potential as a monitoring tool and
the applicability of imaging biomarkers in guiding treatment decisions.20

Microvessel Density

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)

Microvessel density (MVD) is often evaluated to
quantify angiogenic activity.10,11 Intratumoral blood and
lymphatic vessels can be observed by immunohistochemical detection of specific endothelial markers such as cluster
of differentiation 34 (CD340), CD31, D2-40/Podoplanin, Factor VIII for vasculature, and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1) for lymphatic
vessels. After immunohistochemical analysis, microscopy
can quantify the density of blood vessel networks.12-15
Proteins of interest also can be analyzed for association
with angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, or both by costaining with specific vessel markers.16
Several studies have demonstrated an association
between MVD and patient outcomes in NSCLC,10,15-18
although there have been conflicting reports.11,19 In a retrospective study of 223 patients with operable NSCLC
(stages IA-IIIA), higher MVD was a significant prognostic
factor by univariate (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; P ¼ .0001)
and multivariate analysis (HR, 2.080; P ¼ .039).18 A
meta-analysis of published literature demonstrated that a
high microvessel count within lung tumors was a poor
prognostic factor for survival in patients with NSCLC.10
However, a second meta-analysis found only weak evidence for MVD as a prognostic marker in NSCLC.19
This variability may be due to methodological differences
between studies, such as the antibody/marker used, sample selection, and counting methods.10,11,13 Because of
the lack of standardization, there has been some debate
regarding the usefulness of MVD as a measure of angiogenesis.13 In addition, a less invasive method is required
to examine angiogenesis over time or with drug treatment.13 Imaging biomarkers of blood flow and volume
and transfer constant (Ktrans) are of interest for monitoring response to antiangiogenic therapy.6,20 Changes in
these parameters have been observed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT)
scans within clinical trials of antiangiogenic therapy for
various solid tumors, including NSCLC,6,20 with ongoing
development of other techniques for assessing tumor perfusion (eg, positron emission tomography (PET) and
15O-labeled water [H215O].21 In recent years, perfusion
CT has demonstrated blood-flow reductions in early

VEGF-A (also known as VEGF) is an important
angiogenic signaling factor, consistently associated with
angiogenesis.17,18,22-24 Human VEGF exists in 6 known
isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF183,
VEGF189, and VEGF206) because of alternative splicing.25 Although all 3 secreted isoforms (VEGF121,
VEGF145, and VEGF165) induce angiogenesis,
VEGF165 is the predominant isoform and is overexpressed in a variety of tumors.25,26 Other VEGF family
members, including placenta growth factor (PlGF)-1 and
-2, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D, are also involved
in angiogenic processes.23,26 Early studies identified
VEGF as a significant prognostic factor in NSCLC by
immunohistochemical analysis, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or immunoassay.17,18,27 Recent studies of the prognostic value of
VEGF in NSCLC have generally supported these earlier
results, and some have also examined other VEGF family
members (Table 1). As with MVD, it is likely that variations in laboratory technique and study design (ie, patient
characteristics) have contributed to the variability in
results from studies of VEGF. However, of all the molecules examined as biomarkers in NSCLC, VEGF has
most consistently been correlated with patient outcomes.
Other forms of VEGF, resulting from alternative
splicing and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
have been evaluated for prognostic significance in
NSCLC.7,28,29 Variations in genomic sequence, called
SNPs, among individuals may cause changes in levels,
function, and/or activity of transcribed proteins.7 Much
of the analysis in NSCLC has focused on SNPs as potential risk factors of developing disease, but several SNPs
have been associated with VEGF expression and angiogenesis.30 Investigation of alternative VEGF isoforms as
prognostic factors in NSCLC has been limited, but results
have been fairly consistent. Among 57 NSCLC samples
analyzed by RT-PCR, a high VEGF189 expression ratio
was correlated with shorter survival (median, 18.0 vs
40 months; P ¼ .0001) and earlier postoperative
disease recurrence (mean time to recurrence, 5 vs 26
months; P ¼ .0086).28 A recent RT-PCR analysis of
130 NSCLC specimens found highly significant (all

VEGF189) and identified VEGF189 as an independent
prognostic indicator by multivariate analysis (P ¼ .025).29
VEGF has also been investigated in NSCLC as a
predictive biomarker for response to antiangiogenic therapy. In a prospective study of a randomized phase 2/3 trial
evaluating carboplatin/paclitaxel alone or with bevacizumab (BCP) in 898 patients with advanced NSCLC,
patients with high plasma VEGF levels had an increased
probability of response with BCP versus carboplatin/
paclitaxel (33% vs 7%, P ¼ .01).31 However, VEGF levels
were not predictive of the survival benefit observed in the
BCP arm.31 The authors postulated that the VEGF-predicted response improvement may not have been related
to the survival benefit of bevacizumab.31 It was also noted
that, because binding of bevacizumab may increase the
half-life of VEGF and limit its detectability, analysis of
VEGF levels by immunoassay in patients treated with
bevacizumab may result in misleading measurements.31
In the preliminary results of a pharmacogenetic subanalysis of this same study, VEGF polymorphism (G-634C)
was 1 of the significant predictors of overall survival (P <
.05).32 More recently, preliminary results of a similar
pharmacogenetic analysis of plasma samples from 88

advanced NSCLC suggest that germline VEGF polymorphisms may impact the disease-control rate and progression-free survival.33
VEGF has also been examined in the contexts of
treatment with vandetanib (Zactima; AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del), a small molecule inhibitor of VEGF signaling, EGFR signaling to a lesser extent, and RET
tyrosine kinases.34,35 A summary was recently published
of 3 studies that evaluated VEGF as a predictive marker of
response to vandetanib in patients with NSCLC, 1 of
which was terminated early.34 In the other 2 studies in
chemotherapy-pretreated patients, low baseline plasma
VEGF levels were associated with superior progressionfree survival with vandetanib versus gefitinib (Iressa;
AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del) (HR, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.86; P ¼ .01) and with docetaxel plus vandetanib 100 mg versus docetaxel plus
placebo (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09-0.68; P ¼ .01).34
Although several phase 3 trials of vandetanib have not
demonstrated substantial clinical benefit in patients with
NSCLC,36-39 these results suggest that VEGF levels may
have predictive value in the management of lung cancer.
More recently, Hanrahan and colleagues analyzed
whether 35 different cytokines and angiogenic factors,
including VEGF, were affected with vandetanib in 123

days 8, 22, and 43.40 In the vandetanib monotherapy
arm, VEGF levels were significantly elevated at day 43 (P
¼ .048).40 VEGF elevations have also been observed preclinically in several tumor types after sunitinib (Sutent;
Pfizer, New London, Connecticutt), an inhibitor of the
VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
pathways.41,42
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptors
(VEGFRs)

The VEGF family of ligands activates 3 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs): VEGFR-1/fms-like tyrosine kinase
1 (Flt1), VEGFR-2/kinase insert domain receptor
(KDR), and VEGFR-3/Flt4.23,26,43 VEGFR-1, expressed
in vasculature, can act as a negative regulator of angiogenesis.26 VEGFR-2 plays a primary role in vasculogenesis
and may stimulate angiogenesis.26 Like other VEGFRs,
VEGFR-3 is essential for development, where it functions
in cardiovascular development and vascular remodeling.26,43 During adulthood, VEGFR-3 is primarily associated with lymphangiogenesis.26,44 Both VEGFR-2 and 3, but particularly VEGFR-3, have been implicated in
lymphatic metastasis.44,45 The variability in the prognostic relevance of VEGFR expression is illustrated by the

3892

results summarized in Table 2. VEGFR-3 has been most
commonly reported as an indicator for poor clinical outcomes in NSCLC.46-48 Similar results have been demonstrated with the other 2 VEGFRs,47-49 but other studies
have failed to show a significant association with clinical
outcomes in NSCLC.49-51 VEGFR-2 was analyzed
among the 35 cytokines and angiogenic factors examined
in the study by Hanrahan and colleagues; notably,
VEGFR-2 serum levels were significantly lowered 8 days
after treatment with vandetanib among all treatment arms
(P ¼ .001) and at day 43 in the vandetanib monotherapy
arm (P < .001).40 Additional parameters that have been
associated with prognosis of NSCLC include VEGFR-3positive endothelial cell density52 and the ratio of VEGF
to VEGFR-1 expression by RT-PCR.53
Recently, VEGF and VEGFR-2 were investigated as
predictive biomarkers in patients with advanced NSCLC
as part of a large prospective clinical trial program, BATTLE (Biomarker-integrated Approaches of Targeted
Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination).54 Patients were
heavily pretreated (at least 2 prior regimens) and enrolled
in an umbrella study where core biopsy samples were
screened for 11 biomarkers, including VEGF and
VEGFR-2 expression. Molecular characteristics of the
EGFR, Ras/Raf, and cyclin D1/retinoid X receptor
(RXR) pathways were also examined. On the basis of the
biomarker analysis, patients were assigned to receive erlotinib, sorafenib, vandetanib, or erlotinib/bexarotene.54-56

Two hundred fifty-five patients were randomized, and the
overall 8-week disease-control rate (primary endpoint)
was 46%. Among patients in the VEGF marker group
treated with sorafenib (n ¼ 39), the 8-week disease-control rate was 64%,54 with a similarly high disease-control
rate of 61% (11 of 18) subsequently reported for sorafenib
in Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation-positive patients
but not in patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors
(23% [3 of 13]) or EGFR high-polysomy (27% [3 of
11]).56 In addition, high VEGFR-2 expression significantly correlated with improved outcome with vandetanib
treatment.54 This study represents a major step toward
molecularly based personalized medicine in NSCLC.
Additional BATTLE studies are planned in chemorefractory patients (BATTLE-2) and in patients with metastatic
disease (BATTLE-3).54
PDGF and PDGFRs

The PDGF family of ligands is composed of 5 different dimeric isoforms (PDGF-AA, -BB, -CC, -DD, and
-AB) that bind and activate 2 receptor tyrosine kinases,
PDGFR-a and PDGFR-b.57,58 PDGF signaling has been
found to play a crucial role in organogenesis during embryonic development and is implicated in a variety of conditions including cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases.59
Initially discovered because of its effects on cellular proliferation,57 PDGF signaling has since been identified as a
promoter of angiogenesis and metastasis through recruitment of stroma (mesenchymal cells and blood vessels) and
fibroblasts.59,60 For example, it is thought that paracrine
PDGF pathway signaling promotes pericyte recruitment
to tumor blood vessels, which may lead to stabilization of
vasculature and promote tumor growth.59-61 Because of
its role in angiogenesis, it has been suggested that PDGF
signaling may also play a role in development of resistance
to antiangiogenic therapies that target the VEGF pathway.62 A preclinical study demonstrated that upregulated
PDGF-C in tumor-associated fibroblasts was associated
with resistance to anti-VEGF treatment in lymphoma cell
lines.62 Interestingly, the source of the redundant angiogenic signaling was a component of the stromal cells
rather than the tumor-cell population.62 These results
suggest that in the context of antiangiogenic therapy, tumor stromal cells may significantly influence efficacy.
Consequently, a more complete understanding of the
crosstalk between these tissues is necessary.
Although PDGF ligands and receptors have been
evaluated as prognostic factors in several malignancies,6365
studies in NSCLC have begun only recently. In a

Cancer

September 1, 2011

(TMA) study of tumor samples from 55 patients with
NSCLC who received adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy, univariate analysis demonstrated that high PDGF
levels correlated with poor survival (P ¼ .002),48 with
high tumor PDGF expression independently associated
with shorter (DSS) by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio
[HR], 5.42; 95% CI, 1.93-15.2; P ¼ .002).48 In another
TMA study of samples from 335 resected patients with
stage I-IIIA NSCLC, high tumor-cell expression of
PDGF-B (P ¼ .001), PDGF-C (P ¼ .01), and PDGFR-a
(P ¼ .026) were negative prognostic indicators for DSS
by univariate analysis, whereas multivariate analysis identified high tumor expression of PDGF-B (P ¼ .001) and
PDGFR-a (P ¼ .047) as independent negative prognostic
indicators.8 High stromal expression of PDGF-A (P ¼
.009), PDGF-B (P ¼ .04), PDGF-D (P ¼ .019), and
PDGFR-a (P ¼ .019) were identified as positive prognostic indicators for DSS by univariate analysis; high stromal
PDGF-A expression (P ¼ .001) was an independent positive indicator for survival by multivariate analysis.8
Although results are suggestive of a prognostic role for
PDGF in NSCLC, additional studies will be necessary to
validate candidate members of the pathway.
Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)

The FGF family of ligands has 22 members that
exert their cellular functions by binding and activating 4
FGF receptor (FGFR1-4) family members.66 Although
there are only 4 receptors, alternative splicing events can
create receptor diversity by increasing selectivity of binding to FGF ligands.66 The complex cellular signaling network created by interactions of FGFs and FGFRs impacts
a variety of normal and pathological processes including
chemotaxis, tissue development, angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis.66 FGF2 (basic FGF or bFGF) is
expressed by many tumor types and plays an important
role in tumor-cell proliferation and angiogenesis.66,67
FGF2 has been shown to have mitogenic and migratory
effects on endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells; however, because mice deficient in FGF2 retain
normal vascularization, the precise role of FGF2 in angiogenesis is unclear.67,68 Similar to the PDGF pathway,
FGF signaling may also play a role in resistance to VEGF
inhibition. In a preclinical study, after a period of
VEGFR-2 inhibition (phase 1), concomitant inhibition
of FGF and VEGF signaling (phase 2) caused a greater
decrease in angiogenesis than VEGFR2 blockade alone
(phase 2) in late-stage pancreatic islet tumors.69 Just as
FGF signaling may contribute to angiogenesis under

3893

Review Article

conditions of VEGF pathway inhibition, it is possible that
other compensatory growth signals may allow for normal
vascularization in the absence of FGF.68,69 Indeed, in the
preclinical study described, tumor burden and angiogenic
measures were slightly higher in phase 2, even with combined VEGF/FGF inhibition, than with maximal
response to initial VEGF inhibition in phase 1, suggesting
that other factors stimulated angiogenesis and tumor
growth in this system.69
Members of the FGF pathway have been investigated as prognostic factors in multiple malignancies,
although evaluation in NSCLC has been more recent and
has focused on bFGF.25,70 In a TMA study of samples
from 335 patients with NSCLC, high tumor-cell FGF2
expression was a negative prognostic factor for DSS (P ¼
.015) and identified as an independent negative prognostic factor by multivariate analysis (P ¼ .038).71 In addition, coexpression of high levels of FGF2/VEGFR-3 (P <
.001), FGF2/PDGF-B (P ¼ .002), FGFR-1/VEGFR-3
(P ¼ .001), and FGFR-1/PDGF-B (P ¼ .002) in tumor
cells were negative prognostic indicators for DSS. Coexpression of high levels of FGF2/VEGFR-3 (P < .001)
and FGFR-1/VEGFR-3 (P ¼ .001) were also correlated
with lymph node metastasis.71 By univariate analysis,
high stromal FGF2 expression was a positive prognostic
factor for DSS (P ¼ .024), and by multivariate analysis, it
was identified as an independent positive prognostic factor (P ¼ .015).71 Another study of 71 patients with
NSCLC reported that high bFGF levels were associated
with poor survival (P ¼ .0059) as was high bFGF/VEGF
expression (P < .0001).72 By multivariate analysis, both
bFGF (P ¼ .0242) and VEGF (P ¼ .0428) were independent prognostic indicators for survival.72 In another
TMA study, high stromal bFGF expression was correlated
with improved survival (P ¼ .017) by univariate analysis
and independently associated with increased DSS by multivariate analysis (HR, 0.077; 95% CI, 0.015-0.40; P <
.001).48 However, a recent retrospective analysis of samples from patients with NSCLC did not find bFGF to correlate with patient outcomes.73 A literature analysis on the
prognostic value of circulating bFGF levels in NSCLC
reported inconsistent results as well.25
MicroRNAs

Small noncoding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs), are newly discovered regulators of angiogenesis
and may prove useful for prognostic efforts in
NSCLC.74,75 MiRNAs negatively affect protein translation at the post-transcriptional level and may affect many

3894

pathways relevant for tumor progression and metastasis.75 An estimated 700 miRNAs have been identified in
the human genome thus far,75 and several reports indicate that expression of a specific miRNA signature is
associated with lung cancer.76-79 In the study by Yanaihara and colleagues, 43 of 147 miRNAs examined were
expressed at significantly different levels in cancerous versus matched normal tissue.77 By univariate analysis, high
expression of 5 miRNAs and low expression of 3 miRNAs were associated with a worse prognosis in patients
with adenocarcinoma; high expression of miR-155 (P ¼
.006) and low expression of let-7a-2 (P ¼ .033) were
associated with poor survival and multivariate analysis
identified miR-155 expression as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor (HR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.13-8.14;
P ¼ .027).77 In another study, high expression of miR155 (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0-5.6; P ¼ .06) and miR-146b
(HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-5.7; P ¼ .0035) were associated
with worse overall survival in squamous cell lung carcinoma.79 Yu and colleagues identified a 5-miRNA signature (consisting of let-7a, miR-221, miR-137, miR-372,
and miR-182), from 157 miRNAs evaluated, as an independent prognostic factor for survival in lung cancer
(HR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.13-7.01; P ¼ .026).78 One of
these, miR-221, has been reported to play a role in angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment, whereas others
are involved in proliferation and anchorage-independent
growth.78 It is well known that 1 miRNA may affect
many targets and, thus, many processes.78 As a result, it
is challenging to determine how differential expression of
a miRNA specifically affects tumor cell function; in fact,
1 miRNA could potentially function as a tumor suppressor and promoter.78
Interleukins

Interleukins are secreted chemokines involved in a
wide range of signaling processes, including inflammation, tumor progression, and angiogenesis.80-82 In a study
of 60 patients with NSCLC and a history of smoking,
plasma levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), an angiogenic chemokine, were reported to be significantly higher in stage
IV (median, 131.4 pg/mL; 95% CI, 135.01]) versus stage
III disease (median, 61.7 pg/mL; 95% CI, 39.7; P ¼
.012).83 Although not identified as an independent prognostic indicator in the study, baseline serum IL-8 levels
were elevated in patients with NSCLC with respect to
control patients (P < .0001).83 In another study of
patients with NSCLC (N ¼ 58), 38 of whom received
surgery and 20 of whom received postoperative

chemotherapy and/or radiation, IL-8 mRNA levels via
quantitative RT-PCR and IL-8 protein were analyzed by
immunohistochemistry.84 IL-8 expression was significantly
elevated in tumor samples versus matched normal lung tissue (P ¼ .012), and patients with tumors exhibiting high
versus low IL-8 expression were more likely to have
advanced disease (Stage IIIA or IIIB; P ¼ .03), distant
lymph node metastasis (P ¼ .02), a high tumor microvessel
count (P ¼ .00,003), shorter survival (<26 months; P <
.00,001), and earlier relapse (<16 months; P < .00,001).84
IL-8 mRNA expression was also identified as a prognostic
factor for survival (P < .0001) and prediction of recurrence
(P ¼ .0001) by multivariate analysis.84 Another study
tested for an association between IL-8 and NSCLC prognosis without success.73 IL-17, an inflammatory cytokine,
has been shown to promote angiogenesis and is frequently
detected in many inflammation-associated cancers, including NSCLC.85 In an analysis of tissue from 52 patients, IL17 was identified as an independent prognostic factor for
disease-free survival (HR, 3.036; 95% CI, 1.345-6.852; P
¼ .007) and overall survival (HR, 2.869; 95% CI, 1.2746.460; P ¼ .011).85 IL-17-positive tumors also had a significantly higher lymphatic vessel density than IL-17 negative
tumors (P ¼ .008), suggesting a possible role in lymphangiogenesis as well as angiogenesis.85
Unlike the proangiogenic IL-8 and IL-17, IL-12 has
been characterized as a strongly antiangiogenic cytokine.86 The usefulness of pretreatment circulating IL-12
levels as a predictive biomarker for antiangiogenic therapy
was recently described for the first time, with an exploratory analysis of a phase 2 trial of pazopanib (GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) as neoadjuvant monotherapy
for early stage NSCLC demonstrating that baseline
plasma levels of IL-12 were most strongly correlated with
tumor size reduction among 31 cytokines and angiogenic
factors (P ¼ .065).87
Several interleukins were included in the panel of 35
cytokines and angiogenic factorss in the aforementioned
study by Hanrahan and colleagues.40 In the vandetanib
monotherapy arm, IL-8 levels were increased at day 8 (P
¼ .041) and IL-17 was increased at day 43 (P ¼ .045).
Significant decreases in IL-12 were observed at day 8 in
the carboplatin/paclitaxel/vandetanib (CPV) (P < .001)
and carboplatin/paclitaxel arms (P < .001). In the CPV
arm, significant correlations were noted for elevations in
IL-8 at day 8 and poorer progression-free survival (HR,
1.48; 95% CI, 1.02-2.16) as well as elevated IL-12 at day
8 and improved progression-free survival (HR, 0.61; 95%
CI, 0.40-0.94).40

Other Factors

Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme well
known for its role in inflammation and pain,88 has also
been implicated in angiogenic processes.89 Results of a
study of 232 NSCLC patients who underwent complete
resection indicated that COX-2 expression measured by
immunohistochemistry correlated significantly with prognosis (HR, 2.280; 95% CI, 1.255-4.143; P ¼ .0068) by
univariate analysis but not by multivariate analysis.90 In
another study of 70 patients with NSCLC, samples with
high COX-2 mRNA levels measured by RT-PCR had a
significantly higher microvessel count than samples with
low COX-2 levels (P < .001).91 In addition, patients with
high COX-2 levels had significantly shorter survival time
(mean survival, 15 vs 40 months; P < .0001) and faster
relapse (mean time to relapse, 5.0 vs 34.0 months; P <
.0001) than patients with low COX-2 levels.91 Another
study reported no correlation between COX-2 and
prognosis.92
Cadherins, transmembrane glycoproteins that regulate cell-cell adhesion, are among the adhesion molecules
associated with tumor angiogenesis and poor survival specifically in the NSCLC population.93 In a retrospective
review of 150 patients with NSCLC, expression of E-cadherin did not correlate with vascularity; however, hypervascularity was significantly higher in tumors positive for
N-cadherin (67.4% vs 49.0%; P ¼ .0373).93 The impact
of N-cadherin positivity on 5-year survival was limited to
undifferentiated large-cell carcinoma (0% vs 55.6%; P ¼
.0013). E-cadherin negativity was associated with lower
survival in the overall population (45.4% vs 64.4%; P ¼
.0146) and was a significant predictor for poor survival by
multivariate analysis (HR, 1.736; P ¼ .0339). Most
recently, in a 62-patient study to evaluate serum levels of
soluble E-cadherin, intracellular adhesion molecule-1
(ICAM-1)/CD54, and E-selectin/CD62E as biomarkers
in lung cancer, levels of all 3 adhesion molecules were significantly elevated in both small-cell lung carcinoma and
NSCLC versus the healthy controls (P < .001), with a
correlation between only E-cadherin levels and the presence of distant metastases.94 Conversely, in a previously
reported prospective study of the prognostic value of Eselectin and ICAM-1 in 57 chemotherapy-treated patients
with advanced NSCLC, serum E-selectin levels were 1 of
only 2 independent prognosticators for survival by multivariate analysis (P ¼ .002), the other being weight loss.95
In the biomarker analysis of the E4599 phase 2/3 trial of
bevacizumab for advanced NSCLC, low baseline ICAM
levels were significantly associated with improvements in

both response rate (P ¼ .03) and survival (P ¼ .005) in
the carboplatin/paclitaxel and BCP arms, supporting further evaluation of adhesion molecules as both predictive
and prognostic biomarkers.31
Inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as collagen XVIII
(precursor of endostatin) and angiostatin, have also been
investigated as potential prognostic factors in NSCLC. In
a study of tissue from 221 patients with NSCLC, collagen
XVIII was identified as a significant prognostic indicator
by immunohistochemical analysis (P ¼ .0015).96 These
results were supported by an immunohistochemical study
of 94 patients with NSCLC that demonstrated expression
of collagen XVIII was an independent negative prognostic
factor; the multivariate analysis included samples that
were strongly positive versus negative (HR, 3.605; 95%
CI, 1.305-9.958; P ¼ .0134) and weakly positive versus
negative (HR, 4.612; 95% CI, 1.361-15.633; P ¼
.0141).97 More recently, however, endostatin was not
validated as a prognostic factor in NSCLC from a panel of
investigated molecules.98
Conclusions and Future Directions
At this time, there are no reliable prognostic or predictive
angiogenic markers in the NSCLC population. Identification and validation of predictive biomarkers will be necessary to personalize antiangiogenic treatment for NSCLC
patients. Several potential angiogenic prognostic factors
are already under investigation because of their potential
clinical utility. As more proteins and molecules relevant
for angiogenic processes are discovered and characterized,
perhaps new candidate biomarkers will become available
for evaluation in NSCLC. Known mediators and inhibitors of angiogenic processes are currently under investigation as biomarkers in NSCLC. It is possible that some of
these factors could be validated as prognostic factors, or as
predictive factors, if their measures correspond with treatment outcome. Large prospective clinical trials, such as
BATTLE, are needed to evaluate candidate biomarkers,
and additional confirmatory studies will be necessary for
validation. It is also likely that advances in sensitivity,
specificity, and standardization of assays will be necessary
before these tools may be streamlined for routine clinical
use.99
