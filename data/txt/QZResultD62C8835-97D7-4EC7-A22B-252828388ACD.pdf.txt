BACKGROUND. The study investigated correlations between adenosine triphosphate / chemotherapy response assay (ATP-CRA) and clinical outcomes after
ATP-CRA-guided platinum-based chemotherapy for unresectable nonsmall-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC).

METHODS. The authors performed an in vitro chemosensitivity test, ATP-CRA, to
evaluate the chemosensitivities of anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, carboplatin,
paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine for chemonaive, unresectable
NSCLC. The cell death rate was determined by measuring the intracellular ATP
levels of drug-exposed cells compared with untreated controls. A sensitive drug
was defined as a drug producing 30% or more reduction in ATP compared with
untreated controls. Assay-guided platinum-based 2-drug chemotherapy was given
to patients with pathologically confirmed NSCLC.

RESULTS. Thirty-four patients were enrolled. Thirty tumor specimens were
obtained by bronchoscopic biopsies and 4 obtained surgically. The median age
was 61 years and 27 patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0–1. The response rate was 43.8%. At a median follow-up period of 16.9 months, the median progression-free and overall survivals
were 3.6 and 11.2 months, respectively. Patients were dichotomized into the platinum-sensitive (S; 20 patients) and resistant (R; 14 patients) groups. The positive/
negative predictive values were 61.1% and 78.6% with a predictive accuracy of
68.8%. Although without significant differences in pretreatment parameters, the
S-group showed better clinical response (P ¼ .036), longer progression-free survival (P ¼ .060), and longer overall survival (P ¼ .025).

CONCLUSIONS. Despite using bronchoscopic biopsied specimens, ATP-CRA and
clinical outcomes correlated well after assay-guided platinum-based 2-drug

ung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death around
the world. Nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises about
80% of all lung malignancies. More than half of NSCLC patients present with stage IIIB or IV disease and they are candidates for systemic
chemotherapy.1
A big obstacle in cancer treatment, including NSCLC, is the heterogeneity of tumor response to chemotherapy. In this situation,

several in vitro chemosensitivity assays have been
developed to predict chemotherapy outcomes.2–8 An
in vitro chemosensitivity assay refers to any laboratory
analysis that is performed specifically to evaluate
whether or not tumor growth is inhibited by various
chemotherapy drugs. Although an in vitro assayguided therapy seems to be ideal, in actuality this
therapy is not widely used in clinical practice because
of various technical problems encountered with this
assay, including the requirement of a high technical
skill level, the large number of required tumor cells,
and the long test turnaround time.9
The adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-based assay is
a sensitive assay that evaluates tumor cell viability by
measuring the intracellular ATP levels of drugexposed cells and untreated controls.6,10–13 This assay
has been somewhat widely studied because its reliability was demonstrated as a sensitive measure of viability in the field of cell biology.14,15 In this study we
modified previous ATP-based assays. Our ATP-based
chemotherapy response assay (ATP-CRA) adopted
new methods, such as the use of ultra-low attachment
culture plates to inhibit the growth of normal cells
and a shortened test turnaround time.16 We previously
reported the clinical feasibility of our ATP-CRA in a
study on a limited volume of tumor samples from
bronchoscopic biopsies.16 Moreover, a survival benefit
with the original ATP assay-guided chemotherapy
design was observed in ovarian cancer patients.6,10,12
Therefore, we investigated correlations between the
ATP-CRA results using bronchoscopic biopsied samples and the clinical outcomes after ATP-CRA-guided
platinum-based chemotherapy in chemonaive patients
with unresectable NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
ATP-CRA was performed in tumor tissue specimens
obtained from patients with suspected lung malignancies. Assay-guided platinum-based 2-drug chemotherapy was given to patients with pathologically
confirmed NSCLC. The eligible patients for this study
were subjects from whom we had successfully
obtained assay results, who presented with unresectable NSCLC, and who received at least 1 cycle
of chemotherapy. The other eligibility criteria were:
1) age 18 years; 2) histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC; 3) stage IIIB or IV (American Joint Cancer
Committee [AJCC] staging 2002)17; 4) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)
2; 5) adequate bone marrow function (neutrophils
1.5 3 103/lL, platelets 100 3 103/lL, and Hb 
10.0 g/dL), adequate renal function (serum creatinine 

1.5 3 upper normal limit), and adequate liver function (serum bilirubin 1.5 3 upper normal limit,
aspartate aminotransferase [AST], and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 1.5 3 upper normal limit); 6) no
previous chemo- or radiotherapy; and 7) no history of
other malignancies (excluding nonmelanoma skin
cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the uterine cervix)
within 5 years. This clinical trial was approved by
the appropriate Institutional Review Board and all
patients in the study gave written informed consent.

ATP-Based Chemotherapy Response Assay Methodology
Isolation of cancer cells, elimination of normal cells, and
tissue culture
Tumor tissues stored in Hank balanced salt solution
(HBSS, Gibco, Rockville, Md), containing 100 IU/mL
penicillin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 100 lg/mL streptomycin (Sigma), 100 lg/mL gentamicin (Gibco), 2.5
lg/mL amphotericin B (Gibco), and 5% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Gibco) were delivered to the laboratory.
These tissues were first washed, quantified, and
minced, then incubated with extracellular matrixdegrading enzymes, such as dispase (Sigma), pronase
(Sigma), and DNase (Sigma) at 378C for 12 to 16
hours. Cells were harvested using a cell strainer (BD
Falcon, Bedford, Mass). To eliminate red blood cells
and dead cells, the cell suspensions were subjected to
Ficoll (1.077 g/mL) gradient centrifugation at 400g for
15 minutes. The viability of isolated cells was tested
using Trypan blue exclusion. The histological types of
the tumor tissues as well as qualitative and quantitative analyses of the cancer cells were evaluated by
pathologists.
ATP measurement
Separated tumor cells were diluted to 2000–20,000
viable cells/100 lL using Iscove modified Dulbecco
medium (IMDM, Gibco), including 10% FBS, and
seeded in triplicate to a 96-well ultra-low attachment
plate (Costar, Cambridge, Mass), which restricted the
growth of normal cells such as fibroblasts. In treated
groups, 100 lL of chemotherapeutic agents were
added to the seeded cell cultures and incubated for
48 hours in a CO2 incubator. In the untreated control
groups, 100 lL of IMDM, without chemotherapeutic
agents, was added. For the purpose of quality control,
a negative control group of 3–6 wells (containing only
seeding medium without cells) and 2 positive control
groups were included in the culture plate. Each positive control group was composed of 3 wells that contained the minimal (105 pg ATP) and median (280 pg
ATP) amounts of ATP, as measured in 1000 tumor cells
harvested from tissue. The final concentrations of
anticancer drugs were determined by training set

experiments, which exhibited a scattered distribution
of cell deaths from each patient (data not shown): cisplatin (2.5 lg/mL), carboplatin (12 lg/mL), paclitaxel
(8.5 lg/mL), docetaxel (3.7 lg/mL), gemcitabine (16.9
lg/mL), vinorelbine (0.18 lg/mL), and irinotecan (4.7
lg/mL), which are all active drugs widely used as a
combination with platinum in advanced NSCLC.18
Cells from the untreated control and treated groups
were lysed and the amount of ATP in the cell lysates
was measured using flash type luminescence measurements on a Victor 3 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Boston, Mass). The cell death rate for each
drug was defined as the rate of ATP luminescence
reduction in the treated group compared with the
untreated control.

ATP-CRA-Guided Chemotherapy
A sensitive drug was defined as a drug producing 30%
or more reduction in ATP compared with untreated
controls. The sensitivity criterion of 30% was determined by results from a previous, retrospective
study19 that analyzed correlations between the ATPCRA results and the outcomes of chemotherapy for
advanced NSCLC. All the patients received platinumbased 2-drug chemotherapy regardless of their in vitro
platinum-sensitivity. Platinum choice (cisplatin or
carboplatin) was dependent on the physicians’ decision. The second drug combined with platinum was
chosen based on the ATP-CRA results. In the cases
sensitive to no drug in vitro, the drug with the highest
cell death rate was chosen.
Chemotherapy was delivered according to the
dosage and schedule listed in Table 2 and was continued for a maximum of 6 cycles or until the appearance of progressive disease.
Analysis of Endpoints and Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoints were a correlation between
the ATP-CRA results and the clinical response and the
predictive values. Response was assessed every 3
cycles or whenever needed. Tumor response was classified according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors.20 The positive predictive value (PPV)
indicates how accurately the test identifies those
patients who will respond to chemotherapy and the
negative predictive value (NPV) indicates how accurately the test detects resistance to chemotherapy.
The secondary endpoints of our study were the
correlations between the ATP-CRA results and progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS).
PFS was defined as the time from commencement of
chemotherapy until progression or death. OS was
defined as the time from chemotherapy to death from
all causes.

All statistical calculations were carried out using
the SPSS Windows program, v. 11.5 (SPSS, Chicago,
Ill). All P-values were 2-sided and the a-value was set
at 0.05. Survival was calculated using the KaplanMeier method. A log-rank test was used to compare
survival between subgroups. Prognostic variables
found by univariate analysis were used in multivariate
analysis by the Cox proportional hazard regression
model.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
From September 2003 to October 2005, 34 patients
were enrolled in this study. The median age was 61
years (range, 42–74) and the ECOG PS was 0–1 in 27
patients and 2 in 7 patients. Thirty tumor specimens
were obtained by bronchoscopic biopsies and the
remaining 4 were obtained surgically. According to
the ATP-CRA results, patients were dichotomized into
the platinum-sensitive (S) and -resistant (R) groups
(Fig. 1). There were no significant differences in pretreatment parameters such as ECOG PS, histology,
and stage between the S- and R-groups. A detailed
comparison of the patient characteristics in the Sand R-groups is summarized in Table 1.

the subgroup sensitive to both drugs had the highest
response rate, 72.7%.
Two patients with platinum-sensitive tumors
could not be assessed for response because of an early
dropout due to patient refusal. The overall clinical
response rate was 43.8% (14/32). The clinical response
rate was higher in the S-group (61.1% vs 21.4% in the
R-group; P ¼ .036; Fig. 1). The PPV and NPV were
61.1% (11 responders/18 patients from the S-group)
and 78.6% (11 nonresponders/14 patients from the Rgroup), respectively, with a predictive accuracy of
68.8%.

Cisplatin was administered in 23 patients (14 from the

(4 from the S-group vs 5 from the R-group). No significant differences were observed in the kinds of selected

dence interval [CI]: 0.9–6.3), with a 6-month PFS rate
of 30.0%. All of the 34 patients were included in the
OS analysis. Within the same follow-up duration, 19
(55.9%) patients died: 18 of cancer-progression and 1
as the result of a traffic accident. The median OS was
11.2 months (95% CI: 4.2–18.2), with a 1-year OS rate
of 47.7%.
According to the ATP-CRA results, the S-group
showed longer PFS (4.7 vs 2.3 months in the R-group;
P ¼ .060; Fig. 3A) and OS (not-reached vs 8.1 months
in the R-group; P ¼ .025; Fig. 3B).

Predictors for Clinical Response and Prognosticators for
Progression or Survival
The significance of using the ATP-CRA results as a
predictor for clinical response was evaluated by comparing these results to other pretreatment parameters,
such as age, sex, ECOG PS, stage, histology, and brain
metastasis. Using univariate analysis, we found that
ECOG PS (P ¼ .010) and the ATP-CRA results
(P ¼ .036) were significant.
The significance of using the ATP-CRA results as a
prognosticator for PFS or OS was also evaluated by
comparing these results to pretreatment parameters.
Table 3 summarizes the significant factors, as determined by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis
identified the following independent prognostic factors (Table 3): ECOG PS for PFS (hazard ratio
[HR] ¼ 3.38; P ¼ .011), histology for PFS (HR ¼ 2.48;
P ¼ .049), and ECOG PS for OS (HR ¼ 2.95; P ¼ .051).
Because the ECOG PS is a significant response
predictor and a prognosticator for progression or survival, a subset analysis was performed according to
the ECOG PS. In the subset of patients with an ECOG
PS of 1 the S-group still had a significantly better
response rate (73.3% vs 26.7%; P ¼ .049), median PFS
(5.0 months vs 2.3 months; P ¼ .028), and median OS

DISCUSSION
The current standard of care for patients with
advanced NSCLC is chemotherapy with a platinumbased doublet as a first-line agent,18 indicating that
none of the platinum-based doublets is superior to
the others.21,22 Under these circumstances, determining the best in vitro drug before the start of chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC may be ideal. However,
for advanced NSCLC only a few in vitro chemosensitivity assays have been tested in clinical trials. Until
now, assay success rates or predictive accuracies were
not satisfying.3,4 Therefore, in this study ATP-based
CRA was prospectively investigated for the first time
for selecting the best in vitro regimen to treat NSCLC.
The S- and R-groups that were dichotomized by
ATP-CRA represented different survival (PFS or OS) as
well as clinical response rates after ATP-CRA-guided
chemotherapy. These clinical outcomes were more
favorable in the S-group. Although our study was not
randomized in order to compare in vitro assay-guided
chemotherapy to empirical chemotherapy, this result
is notable in that 2 subgroups classified by ATP-CRA
showed significantly different survival rates. There
were fewer stage IV, brain metastasis, and ECOG PS-2
patients in the S group, leading to more cycles of
chemotherapy administered. This may have produced
the survival difference. However, the differences in the
pretreatment clinical factors were very small and were
not statistically significant between the 2 subgroups.
Moreover, even after excluding the influence of the
ECOG PS, which was identified as an independent
prognosticator in this study, a survival difference was
still maintained, according to the ATP-CRA results.
The overall response rate (43.8%) and the overall
survival duration (11.2 months) reported here are similar to results from advanced NSCLC studies with similar regimens to ours.21,22 In 2004 a meta-analysis
reported that in vitro chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance assays should not yet be used in clinical practice because no survival benefit was found. However,

this analysis did find a higher response rate by assayguided therapy and encouraged those assays to be
tested widely in clinical trials.23 In spite of the metaanalysis, some newer cell death assays (cell viability
assays), such as the ATP-assay, have shown a high correlation between assay results and survival, as well as
response,6,10,12 supporting our finding that the ATPCRA results and the clinical outcomes in this study
correlated well.
It is well known that an anchorage-independent
culture method, such as an agar underlayer, inhibits
the growth of fibroblasts but allows tumor cells to survive and proliferate.24 An ultra-low attachment plate
is another anchorage-independent culture method.
This was adopted in our ATP-CRA and inhibited fibroblast proliferation better than an agar underlayer in
our preclinical study (data not shown). This method
might have partially contributed to the positive correlation obtained in our study.
Moreover, in our previous feasibility study of this
assay,16 ATP-CRA had the advantages of a short test
turnaround time of 7 days and a high assay success
rate of 88.9%, despite using specimens obtained by
bronchoscopic biopsies. For the in vitro chemosensitivity assay the procurement of specimens is another
important issue. It is very encouraging that bronchoscopic biopsy, which is generally the least invasive biopsy procedure for lung cancer, could be utilized for
this ATP-CRA. This fact is also supported by other
reports,14,15 which demonstrated that the ATP-based
assay was sensitive enough to test cell viability with
very small specimens. A short test turnaround time in
our assay resulted from cutting the incubation time
down to 48 hours, as reported in other studies,25,26
with rising drug concentrations. These technical
advantages would allow our ATP-CRA to be easily
applied in clinical trials and perhaps eventually in
clinical practice.
In order to determine the value of a diagnostic
test in a specific patient it is important to know pre-

dictive values of the in vitro test in an individual
patient. Our assay showed a PPV of 61.1% and an NPV
of 78.6%. The fact that the NPV was higher than the
PPV indicates that our ATP-CRA can detect drug resistance better than chemosensitivity, being consistent with previous in vitro assay studies.27 Because
patients’ tumors may have an intraindividual heterogeneity depending on different biopsy sites with
regard to chemosensitivity, in the current study the
PPV, indicating an accuracy for detecting chemosensitivity, was not high. Conversely, a drug resistance
result obtained from a single tumor sample for a specific drug is evidence of the presence of a nonresponsive tumor population in at least 1 site, alerting the
physician to avoid such an agent.27
The limitation of this study was that we did not
consider interactions between the 2 drugs and individual pharmacokinetic variations. We also did not
compare the ATP-CRA-guided chemotherapy to empirical chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC. Our study
also had a very small number of patients. Although it
is not possible to make definitive conclusions, there is
a good possibility that this technique may predict
drug resistance. Good correlations between the ATPCRA results and clinical outcomes are encouraging.
In conclusion, despite using bronchoscopic biopsied specimens, the ATP-CRA results and the clinical
outcomes correlated well after assay-guided platinumbased 2-drug chemotherapy for unresectable NSCLC.
This showed a favorable response and survival in the
platinum-sensitive vs resistant groups. Randomized
trials that compare ATP-CRA-guided chemotherapy to
empirical chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC are warranted.
