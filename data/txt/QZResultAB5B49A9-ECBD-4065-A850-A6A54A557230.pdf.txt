ABSTRACT
Previous studies have indicated that Her-2 induction causes a strong decrease
in thioredoxin interaction protein (TXNIP) in breast cancer cells. However, little is
known regarding the prognostic value of TXNIP in clinical breast cancer patients
with anti-Her-2 treatment. Using a tissue microarray, we detected TXNIP and p27
expression in breast cancer tissue, as well as corresponding noncancerous tissues.
We found that TXNIP expression was associated with better overall survival (OS) in
these 150 breast cancer patients and that TXNIP and Her-2 expression status were
significantly inversely correlated (r=-0.334, P<0.001). These results were validated
in another 101 breast cancer tissue samples (r=-0.422, P<0.001). Moreover, TXNIP
expression increased significantly following treatment of the human breast cancer cell
lines BT474 and SK-BR-3 with a Her-1/2 inhibitor. Furthermore, TXNIP transfection
induced p27 expression and G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, our
findings suggest that TXNIP plays a critical role in anti-Her-1/Her-2 treatment and
may be a potential prognostic marker in breast cancer.

triggered survival program.
It has also been reported that the redox balance in
cancer cells is disrupted by oxidative stress caused by
accelerated cell proliferation, constant stimulation of
growth promoting signaling pathways and alterations
in metabolic activity [3]. Therefore, as a major redox
regulator, TXNIP has recently been proposed as a
therapeutic target for cancer treatment [4].
TXNIP may also be a prognostic marker of breast
cancer response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy
[5]. Based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of 98
locally advanced primary breast cancer patients, TXNIP
was found to be an independent prognostic factor for
distant metastasis-free survival [5]. However, despite the
ongoing evaluation of TXNIP as a therapeutic target, little
is known about the prognostic value of TXNIP in breast
cancer patients receiving anti-Her-2 treatment and its

As a negative regulator of thioredoxin (TRX),
thioredoxin interaction protein (TXNIP) (also known
as Vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1 (VDUP-1) or
thioredoxin binding protein 2 (TBP-2)) has strong growth
suppressive, metastasis inhibitory and proapoptotic
functions [1]. Subsequently, it has been identified as
a tumor suppressor gene in various solid tumors and
hematological malignancies, including breast cancer [2]. A
recent study on the association of TXNIP expression and
metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients found
that TXNIP was associated with better prognosis [2]. They
induced Her-2 in MCF-7 cells, which strongly inhibited
TXNIP expression, following a strong increase reactive
oxygen species levels. This Her-2-dependent repression of
TXNIP expression was interpreted as being part of Her-2www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

relevance to overall survival (OS). Here, we investigated
TXNIP expression in early stage breast cancer patients
and its association with OS. We further evaluated TXNIP
expression in response to anti-Her-2 treatment, to examine
the role of TXNIP in the Her-1/2 pathway as well as its
effects on OS of breast cancer patients.

these proteins in malignant tumor and corresponding
noncancerous tissues (NCTs) samples from 150 patients
using a tissue microarray (Figure 1A). We found that
high TXNIP or p27 expression was associated with better
OS (Figure 1B, P=0.001 and P=0.012). Demographic,
pathological and clinical variables were collected and
correlations of TXNIP expression with clinicopathological
factors of breast cancer patients were determined (Table
1). Of the 150 tumor tissues, 48 cases (32%) and 102
cases (68%) expressed TXNIP at high and low levels,
respectively. TXNIP and p27 expressions were decreased
in breast cancer tissue compared with NCTs (P =0.003,
P <0.001, respectively ) (Table 2). We next analyzed the
correlation between TXNIP, p27 and Her-2 expression
at the tumor microarray or at tumor tissues, respectively.
A significant negative correlation was found between

TXNIP and Her-2 status using the breast cancer tissuearray (n=150) (r=-0.334, P<0.001), which was again
validated in the external cohort (n=101) (r=-0.422,
P<0.001) (Table 3). Similarly, a significant negative
correlation was found between p27 and Her-2 status using
the breast cancer tissue-array (n=150) (r=-0.344, P<0.001)
that was confirmed in the external cohort (n=101) (r=0.284, P=0.004) (Table 4). Therefore, TXNIP and p27
are inversely associated with Her-2 status. Accordingly, a
significant positive correlation was found between TXNIP
and p27 using the breast cancer tissue-array (n=150)
(r=0.340, P<0.001) that was confirmed in the external
cohort (n=101) (r=0.331, P=0.001) (Table 5).SK-BR-3
and BT474 cell lines were transfected with pcMV6TXNIP plasmid to determine whether TXNIP contributes
to p27 expression, followed by western blotting and
confocal microscopy to detect p27 and TXNIP expression.
We found that pcMV6-TXNIP-transfection enhanced p27
expression in BT474 and SK-BR-3 cells (Figure 1C and
D).

To investigate whether the Her-1/2 pathway affects
TXNIP expression in human breast cancer cells, BT474
and SK-BR-3 cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cetuximab,
20 μg/ml trastuzumab or 0.5 μM lapatinib. TXNIP and p27
mRNA levels were detected by RT-PCR and protein levels
by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 3A and B,
cetuximab, trastuzumab and lapatinib treatment induced
TXNIP and p27 expression in BT474 and SK-BR-3
cells at varying levels with lapatinib causing the most
significantly upregulation of TXNIP and p27 expression.
To study the regulatory mechanism of Her-1/2dependent inhibition of TXNIP, luciferase activity was
assayed after transfecting BT474 and SK-BR-3 cells
with a TXNIP-promoter plasmid. Twenty-four hours
after TXNIP promoter plasmid transfection the relative
luciferase activities were enhanced in all three treated
groups. TXNIP expression could thus be induced
by transcriptional inhibition of Her-1/2 (Figure 3C).
Collectively, our results show that TXNIP transcription is
upregulated by inhibition of Her-1/2 signaling.

TXNIP causes G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibits cell
proliferation in Her-1/2 positive breast cancer cell
lines

DISCUSSION

Recent studies suggest that TXNIP plays an
important role in suppressing cellular growth [6]
and in inducing apoptosis [7]. In this study, we also
demonstrated that overexpression of TXNIP could induce
p27 expression in BT474 and SK-BR-3 cell lines. It was
reported that p27 was a crucial negative regulator of the
protein kinase CDK2/cyclin E and could cause G0/G1 cell
cycle arrest [8]. Using flow cytometry to explore the role
of TXNIP in the cell cycle control and cell proliferation
in breast cancer, we found that TXNIP overexpression
enhanced G1 cell cycle arrest (Figure 2A) and induced
apoptosis both in BT474 and SK-BR-3 cell lines (Figure
2B). Moreover, upregualtion of TXNIP suppressed the
proliferative ability of BT474 and SK-BR-3 cells (Figure
2C). We previously indicated that lapatinib, a dual Her1/Her-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has potent antitumor
effects against human breast cancer [9]. To investigate
whether TXNIP enhances lapatinib-induced inhibition
of cell proliferation, we transiently transfected SK-BR-3
cells with a pcMV6-TXNIP-expressing vector, and treated
them with 0.5μM lapatinib for 48 h. We found that TXNIP
expression inhibited cell proliferation both in the presence
and absence of lapatinib (Figure 2D). Taken together, our
results suggest that TXNIP may enhance lapatinib-induced
inhibition of cell proliferation in Her-1/2 positive breast
cancer cell lines.

In this study, we found a significant negative
correlation between TXNIP and Her-2 status in breast
cancer, and showed that inhibition of the Her-1/2 pathway
resulted in increased TXNIP expressions. These findings
are consistent with previous reports indicating that Her2 induction strongly inhibits TXNIP expression in breast
cancer cells [2]. Also, using a tissue array, we found
decreased expression of TXNIP and p27 in breast cancer
tissue, compared with NCTs. Further study indicated that
overexpression of TXNIP was accompanied by increased
p27 expression, which resulted in G1 arrest and inhibition
of cell proliferation. This may explain our finding that
high TXNIP expression was associated with increased OS,
because p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor,plays a
pivotal role in inhibiting cell proliferation and apoptosis
[10]. Moreover several studies­(including a meta-analysis
conducted by us) have demonstrated that reduced p27
is an independent prognostic factor for poor overall and
disease-free cancer survival [11].
The human EGFR family comprises four closely
related transmembrane glycoprotein receptors that contain
an extracellular ligand binding domain and an intracellular
receptor tyrosine kinase domain. This family includes
Her-1 (also known as ErbB1 and EGFR), Her-2 (also
known as HER-2/neu and ErbB2), Her-3 (also known as
ErbB3), and Her-4 (also known as ErbB4) [1]. Treatment
of breast cancer cells with a combination of Her-1 and
Her-2 inhibitors results in a synergistic antitumor effect
mediated by the modulation of several downstream

signaling proteins and cell cycle regulatory proteins,
including transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation
of p27 expression [12]. As previously observed, the dual
Her-1/2 inhibitor lapatinib regulates p27 expression at
the transcriptional as well as the post-translational level
[9]. Meanwhile, we showed that cetuximab, trastuzumab
and lapatinib treatment led to increased TXNIP and p27
expression in BT474 and SK-BR-3 cells. Taken together,
TXNIP may therefore potentially impact cell survival
through its interaction with p27 in the Her-1/2 pathway.
To our knowledge, few study has been reported a
direct influence of Her-1/2 signaling on TXNIP mRNA
expression. Glucose induces TXNIP expression,and ROS
triggers the dissociation of TXNIP from thioredoxin,
leading to increased TXNIP availability for activation
of the NLRP3 inflammasome [13]. Also, hyperglycemia
regulates thioredoxin-ROS activity through induction of
TXNIP in breast cancer derived cells [14, 15].Inhibition
of EGF signaling in Her-2-positive breast cancer has been
associated with glucose deprivation and energetic stress
[16]. Accordingly, treatment with lapatinib is associated
with increased expression of glucose deprivation response
network genes [17]. Therefore, TXNIP may be induced
via hyperglycemia regulated thioredoxin-ROS activity
in Her-1/2 signaling pathway.Information regarding this
mechanism will require further investigation in the future.
Collectively, our results suggest that dynamic
regulation of TXNIP interaction with the Her-1/2 pathway
contributes to OS of breast cancer (Figure 4). When treated
with the anti-Her-1 monoclonal antibody cetuximab,
the anti-Her-2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab or
the dual Her-1/2 inhibitor lapatinib, TXNIP mRNA and
protein levels were increased in breast cancer cells.
Overexpression of TXNIP was accompanied by increased
p27 expression, resulting in G1 phase arrest and inhibition
of cell proliferation. Moreover, high TXNIP and p27
expression were associated with better OS in human breast
cancer patients. In conclusion, TXNIP may interrupt Her

receptor family mediated oncogenic pathways thereby
increasing OS in breast cancer patients. Our findings
suggest TXNIP plays a critical role in anti-Her-1/Her-2
treatment and may be a potential prognostic marker in
breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical samples
Breast cancer tissues and corresponding
noncancerous tissues (NCTs) sections containing
HBre-Duc170Sur-01 (170 cancer cases) and HBreDuc090Sur-01 (90 NCTs) were provided by Outdo
Biotech (Shanghai, China). The validation set containing
101 breast tumor tissues were collected from Wuxi City
People’s Hospital (Jiangsu, China) between January
2012 and December 2013. None of the patients received
chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to surgery. The
experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee
of Jinling Hospital and were conducted in compliance
with the Helsinki Declaration. Disease histology was
determined in accordance with the criteria of the World
Health Organization. Pathologic staging was performed in
accordance with the current International Union against
Cancer tumor-lymph node metastasis classification.

Immunohistochemistry
Breast tumor tissue samples were deparaffinized
in xylene. Heat-mediated antigen retrieval was applied
using citrate buffer (BioGenex Laboratories, San Ramon,
CA). Antibody staining was visualized with DAB (Sigma,
D-5637) and hematoxylin counterstain. The H-score
method was used in this trial. We multiplied the percentage
score by the staining intensity score. The percentage

of positively stained cells was scored as “−” (0%), “+”
(1%-25%), “++” (26%-50%) or “+++” (51%-100%).
Intensity was scored as “−” (negative), “+” (weak), “++”
(moderate) and “+++” (strong). Immunohistochemical
scoring was performed without prior knowledge of the
clinical response. Immunostained sections were scanned
using a microscope (Aiovert 200; Carl Zeiss).

Total protein was extracted using RIPA buffer
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and
quantitied using a BCA kit (Thermo Scientific ,Pittsburgh
PA,USA) and 20 μg of protein was loaded in each lane
and separated on a sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide
(SDS-PAGE) gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose.
Blots were blocked with 5% dry milk in tris-buffered
saline/0.1% tween-20 and incubated overnight with a
diluted solution of primary antibody at 4°C, followed by
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:5000) for 2 h. The specific antibodies used for western
blot were mouse anti-TXNIP antibody (1:100, MBL) and
mouse anti-p27 antibody (1:1000, ab54563). Bands were
normalized to GAPDH expression, which was used as an
internal loading control. Results from at least two separate
experiments were analyzed.

Cell cultures and Her-1/2 inhibitor treatment
Breast cancer cell lines (BT474 and SK-BR-3) were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in RPMI1640 medium
(GIBCO, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2. Cetuximab (Erbitux; MerckKGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany) and trastuzumab (Herceptin, F. HoffmannLa Roche, Basel, Switzerland) were dissolved in sterile
apyrogen water and stored at 4°C. Lapatinib (Tykerb,
GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NJ, USA) was
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (dimethyl sulfoxide as
a stock solution at 10mM) and stored at −20°C. BT474
and SK-BR-3 cells were treated with cetuximab and
trastuzumab at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml and
20 μg/ml in the culture medium, respectively. BT474
and SK-BR-3 cells were treated with lapatinib at a final
concentration of 0.5 μM in the culture medium.

Immunofluorescence analysis
Immunofluorescent staining was used to verify
the expression and subcellular localization of p27. Cells
were plated onto glass cover slips in six-well plates and
transfected with pcMV6-TXNIP for 48 h. After washing
with PBS and fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min,
cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10
min and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with mouse anti-p27antibody (1:200, ab54563). The cells were then washed
with PBS and incubated for 30 min at 37°C with secondary
anti-mouse IgG conjugated with FITC (Invitrogen; 1:200).
Cells were then incubated with goat Texas red–conjugated
anti-mouse IgG (Becton Dickinson-PharMingen) at a
dilution of 1:200 in blocking buffer for 30 min followed
by extensive washing with PBS. For all stains, cells were
incubated with 5 μg/ml of 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Sigma) to stain the nuclei. Finally, cells were
mounted with mounting solution (DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark) and examined under a LSM510 confocal
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany).

Plasmids and transient transfection
The pcMV6-TXNIP plasmid was a gift from
Xiaofeng Le (MD Anderson Cancer Center). The pGL3TXNIP-promoter plasmid was synthesized by GENEray

control. BT474 and SK-BR-3 cells were plated in sixwell plates at a density of 1×106 cells/plate 24 h prior to
transfection. Cells were transfected with either the TXNIP
overexpression sequence or the random sequence using
TurboFect Transfection Reagent (Thermo Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After incubation
at 37°C for 48 h, cells were collected to measure TXNIP
and p27 expression by Western blot analysis.

Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis
BT474 and SK-BR-3 cells were transfected with
pcMV6-vector and pcMV6-TXNIP plasmid for 48 h, then
harvested by trypsinization (not with EDTA) and washed
with PBS. Analysis of the cell cycle and apoptosis was
performed as previously described [18].

Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of
500 cells per well. After 14 days, the colonies were fixed
with 70% ethanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet.

Statistical analyses

Colonies larger than 1 mm were manually counted. These
experiments were repeated at least three times.

SPSS Statistics 16.0 (SPSS Inc.) was used for
statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using one-way
ANOVA or a Student’s t-test. Data are presented as
means ± the standard deviation (SD) of three independent
experiments. The χ2 tests were used to compare the
distribution of demographic variables between TXNIP
high expression group and TXNIP low expression group.
The log-rank test was used to assess statistical significance
of Kaplan-Meier plots. For IHC data, the Two-Relatedsamples test between breast cancers and NCTs was used,
and the statistical significance of the correlation between
TXNIP expression level and Her-2 expression level in
breast cancers or in NCTs was estimated by Spearman’s
Rank correlation analysis and statistical significance was
again defined as *P < 0.05 or **P < 0.001.

Cell proliferation assays
BT474 and SK-BR-3 cells were seeded on sixwell plates (105 cells/ well). After 24 h, cells were
transfected with pcMV6-vector TXNIP. The effects of
0.5 μM lapatinib on cell proliferation were measured 48
h following initial exposure to treatments by counting
cells, with cell viability determined by trypan blue dye
exclusion.

Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
Cells (1×105/well in a six-well plate) were
transiently transfected with 1 μg of luciferase construct
(pGL3-promoter-luc, and pGL3-Luc) and 0.1 μg of pRLTk (Promega,Madison,USA) together with the indicated
plasmids using Lipofectamine/plus reagent (Invitrogen
,Carlsbad,CA,USA). After transfection for 24 h, the
cells were harvested with the lysis buffer, and luciferase
activities of cell extracts were measured by a luminometer
(Centro XS3 LB960, Berthold, Germany) with the use of
the Dual-luciferase assay system (Promega,Madison,USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Relative fire
fly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase
activity and activity was expressed as fold induction. Each
assay was performed in triplicate and the experiment was
repeated at least three times.

Conflicts of interest

RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR

The authors declare that they have no conflict of
interest.

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using
TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen ,Carlsbad,CA,USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. For quantitative RTPCR analysis of TXNIP and p27, 1µg total RNA was
reverse transcribed to cDNA with oligdT primers and
Thermoscript (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Primer sequences
(forward and reverse, respectively) were as follows:
TXNIP,
5’-AGAGCCAACAGAACAGAAGAA-3’
and
5’-AGAGGCAGATCATTTAAGAGTG-3’;
p27,
5’-AGAGCCAACAGAACAGAAGAA-3’
and
5’-AGAGGCAGATCATTTAAGAGTG-3’;
β-actin,
5’-AGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3’
and
5’-CGCTCATTGCCGATAGTG-3’. Real-time PCR
analyses of TXNIP and p27 were performed on an ABI
7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) using SYBR green dye (Invitrogen
,Carlsbad,CA,USA). A 20 μl reaction volume included 1μl
cDNA, 1× QuantiTect SYBR green PCR Master Mix, and
0.5 μM of sense and 0.5 μM of antisense primer. All PCRs
were performed in triplicate. Threshold cycles (CT) were
determined using fixed threshold settings.
