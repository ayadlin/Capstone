ABSTRACT:
In 2011, The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has announced 24 provocative
questions on cancer. Some of these questions have been already answered in “NCI’s
provocative questions on cancer: some answers to ignite discussion” (published in
Oncotarget, 2011, 2: 1352.) The questions included “Why do many cancer cells die
when suddenly deprived of a protein encoded by an oncogene?” “Can we extend
patient survival by using approaches that keep tumors static?” “Why are some
disseminated cancers cured by chemotherapy alone?” “Can we develop methods
to rapidly test interventions for cancer treatment or prevention?” “Can we use our
knowledge of aging to enhance prevention or treatment of cancer?” “What is the
mechanism by which some drugs commonly and chronically used for other indications
protect against cancer?” “How does obesity contribute to cancer risk?” I devoted a
single subchapter to each the answer. As expected, the provocative questions were
very diverse and numerous. Now I choose and combine, as a single problem, only
three last questions, all related to common mechanisms and treatment of age-related
diseases including obesity and cancer. Can we use common existing drugs for cancer
prevention and treatment? Can we use some targeted “cancer-selective” agents for
other diseases and … aging itself.

INTRODUCTION

chronically used for other indications protect against
cancer? The last question “How does obesity contribute
to cancer risk?” is also related, since obesity is age-related
disease (despite it can be easily caused or prevented by
simple environment tactic – diet) and aging is a common
mechanism for both aging and cancer as we have
discussed [1]. Some common treatments emerged to
prevent/suppress both obesity and cancer. Here I combine
three related questions into a single problem, suggesting
common treatments against some age-related diseases
for cancer prevention as well as experimental anti-cancer
agents for treatment of some age-related diseases and
possibly aging.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has announced
24 provocative questions on cancer for grant applications.
Some of these really important questions could be
answered at least in part in 2011, [1] just based on the
existing knowledge, linking unrelated fields of science
and medicine. Such an approach is very effective. For
example, retrospective analysis of the effect of betablockers and metformin on breast cancer given for
treatment hypertension and diabetes, respectively, has
revealed their cancer-preventive effects in humans [2-6].
The questions answered in “NCI’s provocative questions
on cancer: some answers to ignite discussion” [1] were
very diverse: from oncogene-addiction to curability of
some disseminated tumors.
Here I choose to extend and update the answers to
3 related questions. Can we use our knowledge of aging
to enhance prevention or treatment of cancer? What
is the mechanism by which some drugs commonly and

Can we use our deepening knowledge of aging to
enhance prevention or treatment of cancer?
First of all, cancer is an age-related disease. The
links between cancer and aging were discussed previously
[1] and I will not be repeating them over here. Both

senescent and cancer cells share the senescent phenotype
[7, 8], including hyper-secretion [9-16]. The main
difference between cancer and aging is that the control
of cell cycle is disabled in cancer (by either loss of tumor
suppressors that inhibit cell cycle (e.g., p16 [17-22]) or
activations of activators of the cell cycle such as Myc [7,
23-39]. When the cancer cell is arrested by p16 induction,
for instance, it becomes senescent (gerogenic conversion).
But this is mTOR (and similar growth-promoting pathway)
that drives gerogenic conversion (geroconversion) [7].
An arrested cancer cell is a senescent cell, whereas a
proliferating senescent cell is a cancer cell [7]. Normal
cells can become senescent by activation cytoplasmic
nutrient-, mitogen-, stress-sensing and growth-promoting
pathways such as mTOR. (I suggest the term gerogenic
pathways, for brevity). If the cell cycle is blocked, such
over-stimulated cells undergo gerogenic conversion
(geroconversion), becoming senescent. What is common
in cancer and senescence is the activation of growthpromoting signaling pathways such as mTOR [7, 40]. The
mTOR pathway is constantly active in cancer cells due to
mutations in receptor kinases, Ras, Akt, or loss of tumor
suppressors (e.g., PTEN, TSC-2). [40-55]. Oncogenic
transformation and gerogenic conversion are very close
phenomena, involving similar signal-transduction
molecules such as mTOR. Cancer and aging are not
rivals but rather two faces of the same coin. In this minireview, I will not discuss other very interesting aspects
of the relationship between cancer and aging, as well
as the meaning of aging because it have been discussed
[56], [57], [58-60] and also because the involvement of
gerogenic (oncogenic) pathways driving geroconversion
(a conversion from cell cycle arrest to senescence [7],
[8, 40]) is “the knowledge that can be used for cancer
prevention”.
Geroconversion can be decelerated by rapamycin. A
serious of experiments performed in diverse mammalian
cells and models, demonstrated that mTOR is in fact
involved in cellular aging [61-72], or strictly speaking, to
gerogenic conversion. Furthermore, mTOR is involved in
cell senescence and stem cell exhaustion in the organism
[73-79].I need to repeat that rapamycin and other inhibitors
of mTOR decelerate geroconversion [7]. But when
geroconvesion is completed, rapamycin cannot reverse
the event entirely. It is easier to decelerate and prevent
senescence then reverse it. Eventually, hyperfunctions of
the cells may be changed to malfunctions and the cells
may become irresponsive to signals, including mTOR
activators.
Calorie restriction (CR) deactivates the nutrientsensing mTOR pathway and delays both aging and cancer
(and other age-related diseases) [80-86] . Very importantly,
short-term CR suppresses cellular senescence in the
organism [87, 88].
Now it would not be surprising that, inhibition of
mTOR decelerates organismal aging [60, 89 [109-113],
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and the [60, 108, 114]. Noteworthy, basal fasting levels of
mTOR activity are increased in old mice [115]. Fasting
is less effective in inhibiting mTOR, than rapamycin in
mice [116].
Rapamycin and other rapalogs, metformin, as well
as potential inhibitors of gerogenic pathways (currently
under investigation in our laboratory) could be used for
cancer prevention. But may other commonly used drugs
can inhibit gerogenic pathways? This is a topic of the next
question.

PQ-5: Given the evidence that some drugs
commonly and chronically used for other
indications, such as an anti-inflammatory
drug, can protect against cancer incidence and
mortality, can we determine the mechanism by
which any of these drugs work?
Certain drugs used for hypertension, atherosclerosis,
diabetes, inflammation and immunossupression can
protect against cancer. These drugs include rapamycin
and other rapalogs, metformin, beta-blockers, angiotensinblockers, aspirin. Since cancer is an age-related disease,
drugs that inhibit gerogenic pathways may prevent cancer.
At conventional doses, these accidental cancer-preventive
agents are relatively ineffective to treat cancer, implying
that their cancer-preventive effects are not due to targeting
cancer cells directly. Aspirin: The anti-inflammatory
agent aspirin, decreases inflammation, one of hallmarks
of senescent cells. In some cell models, salicylate acid
and aspirin inhibit the mTOR pathway [117, 118].
Aspirin decreases cancer incidence in humans [119128]. Angiotensin-II-blockers. Inhibitors of angiotensin
II activity include ACE inhibitors (such as captopril and
lisinopril), which decrease angiotensin II production,
and angiotensin receptor blockers such as losratan.
Angiotensin-II-blockers suppress in hepatocarcinogenesis
in rats [129] chemically-induced colon carcinogenesis
obese mice and metastasis in mice [129-132]. In humans,
use of these drugs is associated with a lower incidence
of cancer occurrence [133-137]. In patients with renal
transplantation, the use of angiotensin-II-blockers is
associated with a two-fold reduced risk of skin cancers
[138].
Angiotensin-II activates the mTOR pathway
and causes cellular hypertrophy [139-149]. Therefore,
angiotensin-II-blockers, which prevent these effects, are
indirect inhibitors of mTOR.
Beta-blockers, which are used for therapy of
hypertension, prevent breast cancer [2-4, 150-152].There
are several publications that activators of beta-androgenic
receptors can activate the mTOR pathway [153, 154].
Therefore, beta-blockers are expected to block mTOR
activation.
Rapamycin decelerates geroconversion (conversion

of quiescence into senescence) in arrested cells [61-68,
155, 156]. Also rapamycin suppresses yeast aging and
prolongs life span in Drosophila and mice [60, 89-113].
Rapamycin should delay cancer by slowing down the
aging process. In fact, rapamycin prevents cancer in mice
[157-164, 104, 105], and humans [165-169].
Finally, rapamycin prevents cancer in mice [104,
105, 112, 113, 157-164] and humans [165-169]. Its cancerpreventing effect may be indirect, due to prevention of
senescent of normal stroma [170].
Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, inhibits the
mTOR pathway [171-173]. Metformin slows down aging,
delays cancer and extend life span in rodents [174-182].
Also metformin decreases the risk of cancer in humans
[5, 6, 183-193]. Metformin also exerts direct anti-cancer
effects [54, 194-197]. Clinical studies in the neoadjuvant
and adjuvant settings are ongoing; additional Phase 2 trials
in the metastatic setting and proof of principle studies in
the prevention setting are planned [198].
The NCI’s questions “How does obesity contribute
to cancer risk?” was discussed previously [1] and
references within. Here I first outline the most important
points discussed in [1]. There are many theories on
how obesity promotes cancer, which mostly all are
partially correct because there are simultaneously several
mechanisms of how obesity contribute to cancer and each
theory is based on some of them [199], [200], [201-205]
Without discussing them again [1], I emphasize
one universal mechanism that obesity promotes cancer
by over-activating the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway in
both normal and cancer cells.
Although obesity is an age-related disease, both
genetic predisposition (other then age-related quasiprogrammed genes) and especially environment play
enormous roles. Obesity can be often induced independent
of aging process by simple overeating. But still almost all
people would gain weight after 30, unless they actively
restrict their food intake. Most fitness-conscious people
do, but unfortunately many others do not. As an aside,
successful restriction of caloric intake can be considered
by itself a treatment for obesity. Still visceral fat, the
most dangerous for the human health, accumulates in old
animals and humans, compared with younger animals and
humans. Obesity is a disease that accelerates all other agerelated diseases: diabetes, kidney disease, atherosclerosis,
liver fibrosis, hypertension, the propensity to blood clots,
neurodegeneration, sarcopenia, osteoporosis and of course
cancer. Obesity accelerates aging and dramatically shorten
life span. The links between obesity and cancer are direct,
indirect and as well as causative and correlative. In all
cases, mTOR is involved [1].
We can summarize the following mechanisms [1]:
a.	 Obesity can promote cancer directly by secretion
several factors, including pro-inflammatory , by the
adipose tissue and can directly stimulate tumor growth.
b.	 Obesity causes hormonal changes such as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

insulinemia and insulin promotes cancer.
c.	Obesity can promote cancer by accelerating
aging, obesity can accelerate aging and aging promotes
cancer.
d.	 Aging can promote both obesity and cancer.
e.	 The relationships between them have been shown
previously (in figure 2 [1]).
Also as we have already discussed [1], nutrients
and insulin activate mTOR, whereas calorie restriction
(fasting) deactivates mTOR. The mTOR pathway
promotes obesity and is activated in obesity. Taking all
together, one can conclude that rapamycin must prevent
obesity.
In fact numerous studies demonstrated that
rapamycin prevented obesity in mice on high fat diet.
Yet, it was also shown that prevention of obesity may
be associated with development of insulin-resistance or
even diabetes-like condition, since chronic high-dose
administration of rapamycin inhibits MTORC2 [206].
This stirred a controversy about rapamycin safety at
chronic doses, especially in lay media. However, in depth
analysis reveals that this condition resembles “starvation
diabetes” described by Claude Bernard almost two
centuries ago [207.] This condition was even observed
during especially severe calorie restriction in humans
and still was beneficial for their health [208]. As I already
discussed, during starvation the organism needs to
preserve glucose to feed the brain using as a tool insulin
resistance in the liver, fat and muscle, lypolisis in the fat
cells, glycogenesis and ketogenesis in the liver. Starvation
diabetes is not a true type II diabetes [209]. I named it
benevolent diabetes or type zero diabetes [209]. In fact,
despite benevolent diabetes, mice live longer. In contrast,
type II diabetes (true diabetes) promotes nephropathy,
retinopathy, atherosclerosis and coronary disease. In
contrast, rapamycin prevented these complications of true
diabetes such as nephropathy and retinopathy [210, 211]
Rapamycin prevents atherosclerosis in rodents [212, 213]
and coronary re-stenosis in humans [214 , 215]. Most
importantly, a recent publication by Piguet et al supports
the concept of benevolent diabetes: Rapamycin impacts
positively on longevity, despite glucose intolerance
induction [216].
There are many paradoxes related to insulin
resistance and longevity (see for ref. [209]). All of them
can be solved by classification of conditions in two
groups: low mTOR versus high mTOR [209]. Calorie
restriction and benevolent diabetes are beneficial, because
they are associated with low mTOR. Rapamycin has many
advantages compared with starvation: starvation may lead
to malnutrition. (This may explain a well-publicized case,
why calorie restriction did not extend life span of rhesus
monkeys, despite decelerating aging [217]). In humans,
rapamycin-induced diabetes is a rare complication even
in transplant patients receiving high doses of rapamycin
every day (see for ref. [209]).
1713

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 1711-1724

But regardless of whether rapamycin-induced
condition is benevolent, it can be avoided, until we know
whether it contributes to lifespan extension or not (just an
association). To avoid inhibition of TORC2 by rapamycin
and insulin resistance, rapamycin should be used in
intermittent fashion or in pulzes [209]. Preliminary data
demonstrate that rapamycin tended to decreases insulin
and obesity when given intermittently [116]. Intermittent
rapamycin also prevents cancer [218, 112].

On the other hand, thousands of drugs have been
developed for treatment of age-related diseases (obesity,
hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmias an so
on) either semi-empirically or by intentional development
of inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, beta-receptor,
growth-factor receptors, angiotensin II, testosterone
signal-transduction pathways. All these drugs are
inhibitors of signal transduction pathways involved in
diseases. Many of them, for example angiotensin II,
inhibit “hyperfunctional” cells by activating mTOR.
Many of these conventional drugs are already known
to inhibit the mTOR pathway. It does not seem to be a
coincidence that drugs that treat age-related diseases
inhibit gerogenic pathways (given that aging itself is
caused by hyperactivation of signal transduction pathways
such as mTOR). Therefore, it would not be surprising to
expect that some of conventional drugs used in the clinic
would have cancer preventive activities, since cancer is
an age-related disease. Therefore retrospective studies
of some commonly used drugs for cancer preventive
effects are warranted. The most trivial and at the same
time are amazing examples (by its genius simplicity)
is calorie restriction or fasting. Calorie restriction and
fasting both slow down aging. They are recommended
for almost all age-related diseases (except for terminal
conditions). Calorie restriction and intermittent fasting
prevent or delay cancer. Recently, it was shown that
short term complete fasting decreased the side effects of
chemotherapy in cancer patients [246, 247, 264, 265].
Since calorie restriction and fasting are not so efficient
as rapamycin in inhibition of mTOR and also may cause
malnutrition, rapamycin at low and/or intermittent doses
may be even a better choice for prevention of side effects
of chemotherapy.

CONCLUSIONS
Currently chemotherapy is the cornerstone of cancer
treatment. It can cause cancer regression, remission and
in rare cases even cure cancer. The arsenal of drugs and
novel methods of their use, new strategies are constantly
growing [219- 228] among many others but the progress
in treatment is modestly incremental. Combining of anticancer drugs together increase their potency [90, 221,
229-234] but usually against both cancer and normal
cells. Although in experiments performed in cell culture,
chemotherapy can kill any cells, it is toxic to normal
cells too (especially to hematopoietic and epithelial) and
death from chemotherapy limits cancer therapy. There
are several solutions. Exploiting some features of cancer
cells, it is possible to protect selectively normal cells from
chemotherapy without protecting cancer cells. This was
demonstrated in paired cancer cells and normal cells in
culture [235-251] and even in mice [252] but clinical trials
have been never done. Another approach is to develop
less toxic agents targeting cancer specific pathways (Ras,
MEK, ERK, PI3K, IGF-1 and insulin, ErbB and other
growth factors receptors, AMPK, mTOR, p70 S6 kinase,
p53, oncogenic metabolism [] [228, 253-259]. The number
of targeted approaches is rapidly growing [219-225]
Such agents have been developed but most of them are
too “weak”, not cytotoxic enough, and resistance rapidly
develops [260, 261]. However, this Achilles’ heel of
signal transduction inhibitors could be used for treatment
two purposes: First, for protection of normal cells from
chemotherapy especially when cancer cells are resistant
[237, 262, 263]. Second, at low and intermittent doses for
treatment of age-related diseases and aging itself. As you
may noticed, many of the targets of such anticancer drugs
(PI3K, IGF-1R, PDGFR HER2 and other growth factors
receptors and signaling molecules such as AMPK, mTOR,
p70 S6 kinase, ATM, p63, p53 are involved in aging and
therefore, in all age-related diseases, one of which is
cancer. Therefore, we can envision administration of such
inhibitors at low, intermittent, non-toxic doses, which
are not intended to damage cells. To prevent cancer by
gerosupression, they need to be administered not at
high doses but in low, intermittent doses. Alternatively,
they could be used as protectors of normal cells from
chemotherapy (rapamycin and nutlin are examples) [241251].
