ABSTRACT
Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a highly malignant tumor characterized by a poor
response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We evaluated the in vitro and in vivo
antitumor efficacy of mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and WYE-354. In vitro assays
showed WYE-354 significantly reduced cell viability, migration and invasion and
phospho-P70S6K expression in GBC cells. Mice harboring subcutaneous gallbladder
tumors, treated with WYE-354 or rapamycin, exhibited a significant reduction in
tumor mass. A short-term treatment with a higher dose of WYE-354 decreased the
tumor size by 68.6% and 52.4%, in mice harboring G-415 or TGBC-2TKB tumors,
respectively, compared to the control group. By contrast, treatment with a prolongedlow-dose regime of rapamycin almost abrogated tumor growth, exhibiting 92.7% and
97.1% reduction in tumor size, respectively, compared to control mice. These results
were accompanied by a greater decrease in the phosphorylation status of P70S6K and
a lower cell proliferation Ki67 index, compared to WYE-354 treated mice, suggesting
a more effective mTOR pathway inhibition. These findings provide a proof of concept
for the use of rapamycin or WYE-354 as potentially good candidates to be studied in
clinical trials in GBC patients.

with advanced biliary-tract cancer [4, 5]. However, the
response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is extremely
limited, with modest impact in overall survival [4, 6–12].
The recent progress in identification and under­
standing of molecular alterations of GBC may improve the
clinical management of patients through the application
of more specific and effective therapies [11, 13, 14].
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has been
proposed as an interesting therapeutic target in cancer with
a pivotal role in cell cycle progression, cell proliferation

INTRODUCTION
Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common type
of biliary-tract carcinomas [1]. Most cases are diagnosed
in advanced stages and patients cannot undergo curative
surgery. Chemotherapy has been the main treatment
option with agents such as gemcitabine, cisplatin,
oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and 5- fluorouracil (5-FU)
[2, 3]. A recent randomized phase III clinical trial (ABC-02
trial) established the cisplatin/gemcitabine (Gem/CDDP)
combination as standard treatment regimen for patients

and angiogenesis [15–30]. This pathway is frequently
activated in different human cancers by a variety of
genetic and epigenetic events [31]. Molecular therapies
targeting mTOR, have being actively investigated and
many of these have now progressed to clinical trials in
many different types of cancer [16, 17, 32].
Previous studies by our group have shown the
upregulation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in
advanced GBC. Through immunohistochemical assays,
we have found that phospho-mTOR and phospho-P70S6K
expression are significantly elevated in human gallbladder
carcinoma compared to non-neoplastic tissues [33, 34].
Moreover, high phospho-mTOR expression was correlated
with a worse prognosis in patients with advanced GBC
[34]. In vitro analysis in GBC cell lines have demonstrated
the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors on reducing cell growth,
cell migration, and phospho-P70S6K expression [33, 34].
Preclinical studies also have confirmed the therapeutic
effects of mTOR inhibitors. Wu et al., have reported
that rapamycin can reduce the incidence of gallbladder
carcinoma in BK5.erbB2 transgenic mouse models [35].
Zong et al., reported that the mTOR pathway inhibition
attenuates the migration and invasion capacities of GBC
using in vivo tumor metastasis mouse model [36]. These
findings provide a rationale for the potential use of mTOR
inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for human gallbladder
carcinoma.
Rapamycin is an mTOR inhibitor and an antifungal
agent with immunosuppressive properties, which has an
established effect on suppressing tumor growth in a number
of solid tumors [37]. The efficiency of mTOR inhibitors
has enabled the development of a number of rapalogs
(rapamycin analogs). These rapalogs, which include
sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus [15],
are allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1 that form a complex
with the intracellular receptor FKBP12, which binds to
mTOR and inhibits mTORC1 downstream signaling.
Apart from rapalogs, there is now strong interest in smallmolecule ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR kinase,
which can either act selectively on mTORC1 and mTORC2
(AZD8055, WYE-354, PP30, PP242) or as dual PI3K- and
mTOR inhibitors (BEZ235 and XL765) [18, 38].
In this study we evaluated the antitumor activity of
the allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin and of the
ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor WYE-354 on preclinical
xenograft GBC tumor models.

rapamycin and its rapalogs, which are specific inhibitors of
mTORC1 [21, 38]. In an earlier publication of our group,
rapamycin also has been shown to significantly decrease
cell viability in gallbladder cancer cells [33].
Cell viability was analyzed by MTS assay according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of WYE-354 for 24, 48, and
72 hours. As shown in Figure 1A, WYE-354 significantly
reduced cell viability starting at a 1 μM concentration after
a 24 hours exposure, in both studied cell lines (P < 0.001).
We did not observe a decrease in cell viability at a dose
of 100 nM, except for the TGBC-2TKB cell line after
72 hours of treatment.
To further investigate the in vitro effects of WYE354 on mTOR signaling, we evaluated the phosphorylation
status of mTOR effectors by immunoblotting. Cells were
exposed to WYE-354 (1 μM) and 0.01% dimethylsulfoxide
(as control) for 18 hours and were lysed and analyzed by
Western blot using commercial antibodies. As shown in
Figure 1B, the phosphorylation of the downstream effectors
of mTOR, 4E-BP1 and P70S6K, were strongly inhibited
in vitro by WYE-354 treatment. No significant changes
were observed in phospho-eIF4E and in total P70S6K,
4E-BP1 and eIF4E protein expression under the treatment
conditions assayed.

RESULTS

Based on the above information and previous work,
we decided to study further whether mTOR inhibitors can
be therapeutically effective in vivo on subcutaneously
established human gallbladder tumors. The effect of
rapamycin and WYE-354 on tumor growth was evaluated
in xenograft GBC tumor models. 2 × 106 or 5 × 106 cells of
G-415 or TGBC2TKB, respectively, were xenotransplanted
into NOD-SCID mice subcutaneously. When tumors
reached an average volume of 100 mm3, the mice were

In order to establish the effect on cell migration
and cell invasion of WYE-354 and rapamycin, G-415 and
TGBC-2TKB were exposed to 0.01% dimethylsulfoxide
(as control), WYE-354 (1 μM), or rapamycin (50 nM)
for 12 hours. After 24 hours, the migration and invasion
rates were significantly lower in treated cells compare
with untreated cells (P < 0.001; P < 0.01, respectively).
Relative migration rates observed in G-415 were 36.7%
(rapamycin) and 32.8% (WYE-354), while TGBC-2TKB
showed a migration rate of 21.0% (rapamycin) and 28.9%
(WYE-354) (Figure 2A). Relative invasion rates in G-415
cells were 51.6% (rapamycin) and 41.5% (WYE-354),
while TGBC-2TKB exhibited 41.0% (rapamycin) and
38.1% (WYE-354) (Figure 2B).

portion of P70S6K, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E proteins. Protein loading was normalized using an antibody recognizing β-actin.

obtained at the end of the in vivo studies was assessed by
Western blot analysis. As shown in Figures 3D and 4D,
treatment with either mTOR inhibitor partially decreased
the phosphorylated status of P70S6K in both G-415 and
TGBC-2TBK tumors. With the WYE-354 regimen, only
half of the analyzed tumors, showed a significant but
marginally decrease in phosphorylation status of P70S6K,
compared to control mice. By contrast, all the tumors
from animals treated with rapamycin showed a significant
but marginally reduction in phospho-P70S6K. As shown
in Supplementary Figure  S1 and Supplementary Figure
S2 (Figure S1 and Figure S2), an immunohistochemical
analysis of phospho-4E-BP1 was performed on the
xenograft tumors tissues. We observed that treatments
with either mTOR inhibitor partially decreased the
phosphorylated status of 4E-BP1 in both G-415 and
TGBC-2TBK tumors. Mice treated with rapamycin showed
lower expression of phospho-4E-BP1 in both cell lines,
G-415 and TGBC-2TKB (Supplementary Figure S1). Mice
treated with WYE-354 display regions with lower staining

treated either with rapamycin or WYE354. Rapamycin
was administered i.p. at a concentration of 10 mg/kg,
daily for 5 days per week for 3 weeks, while WYE-354
was administrated at a daily i.p. dose of 50 mg/kg for
5 days. Mice were sacrificed 30 days after the initiation of
the treatments and an autopsy was performed that included
removal of the entire tumor area. Mice bearing G-415 or
TGBC-2TKB tumors and treated with rapamycin exhibited
92.7% and 97.1% reduction in average tumor size
(P < 0.001; P < 0.5), as well as 84.3% and 88.7% in tumor
weight (P < 0.001; ns) compared to the control, respectively
(Figures 3A, 3B and 3C). While mice treated with WYE354 exhibited 68.6% and 52.4% reduction in average tumor
size (P < 0.01; P < 0.01), as well as 82.9% and 45.5%
(P < 0.01; ns) reduction in tumor weight, respectively.
(Figures 4A, 4B and 4C). Macroscopic analysis of the
tumors revealed decreased vascularization in treated groups

DISCUSSION

expression and smaller area of phospho-4E-BP1 compared
with controls in both cell lines (Supplementary Figure S2).
Altogether, the qualitative analysis of the staining of
phospho-4E-BP1 showed a decrease in its expression in
mice treated with each of the inhibitors in both cell lines.
For WYE-354, the effect appears to be more noticeable for
the cell line G-415, which is related to the greater cytotoxic
effect observed in this cell line compared to TGBC-2TKB
(Figure 2. Tumor weight reduction 82.9% vs 45.5%).
We also investigated the Ki67 proliferative index in
tumors from animals treated with both mTOR inhibitors
at the end of the in vivo assays. The expression of Ki67
was determined via standard immunohistochemical
techniques on serial paraffin sections. The results showed
that the number of Ki67 positive cells was decreased
in both G-415 and TGBC-2TKB tumors from mice
treated with rapamycin, 58.8% and 28.5%, respectively,
(P < 0.5; ns) compared with their controls (Figure 3E).
The proliferation index in tumors from animals treated
with WYE-354 was significantly decreased only in TGBC2TKB tumors - 23.2%; (P < 0.01) - and interestingly
showed a higher Ki67 expression in treated G-415 tumors
compared to the control, but this difference did not reach
significance (Figure 4E).

Deregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway has
been associated with the pathogenesis of various human
cancers [20, 22, 39–44], and studies have shown its role
in angiogenesis, progression, and treatment resistance
[45]. In this study, we have evaluated for the first time the
therapeutic efficacy of two mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin
and WYE-354, in preclinical models of human GBC in
NOD-SCID mice.
The best characterized downstream substrates of
mTORC1 are the ribosomal protein P70S6K and 4E-BP1.
Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 releases eIF4E, allowing the
initiation of translation. By acting on P70S6K, mTOR
facilitates ribosome biogenesis and translation elongation
[46–51]. As a downstream effector of mTOR pathway, the
phosphorylation status of P70S6K commonly is used as a
marker of mTOR activity and for the pharmacodynamic
monitoring of mTOR inhibition [52, 53]. Previously
published data from our group shows that phospho-mTOR
and phospho-P70S6K expression are significantly higher
in human gallbladder carcinoma than in non-neoplastic
tissues and that high expression of phospho-mTOR is
associated with poor survival in patients with advanced
GBC [33, 34]. Similar to our previous in vitro studies

with rapamycin in GBC cells [33], WYE-354 inhibited
cell viability and decreased cell migration and invasion,
accompanied by a markedly decreased phosphorylation
status of P70S6K and 4E-BP1 under the treatment
conditions assayed. These results indicate that WYE354 negatively regulated the phosphorylation of effectors
downstream from mTOR (mTORC1) and inhibited the
mTOR signaling pathway under the study conditions.
Although it has been reported that concentrations equal to
or greater than 10 nM of WYE-354 have off target-effects
on mTOR pathway [38, 54] we did not observe a decrease
of in vitro cell survival at a dose of 100 nM. Similar
observations have been reported for some tumoral cell
lines treated with rapamycin. Concentrations of rapamycin
required to reduce in vitro cell viability in breast cancer
cells and malignant glioma cells, were significantly
higher than the concentrations needed to suppress levels
of phospho-P70S6K and phospho-4E-BP1 [55–58].
However, the efficacy of rapamycin is tumour- and celltype specific, and the precise mechanism behind its actions
is not completely understood [59].
Several studies have demonstrated the therapeutic
efficacy of mTOR inhibitors on suppressing tumor
growth in a number of solid tumors on human
subcutaneous growing xenografts [19, 21, 60] and in
many phase I–III clinical studies [16, 17, 32]. However,
only a few studies have reported the use of mTOR
inhibitors on in vivo human GBC. Zong et al. [36]
used rapamycin to study the effect of mTOR pathway
inhibition on migration and invasion of GBC in tumor
metastasis mouse models. Weng et al. used rapamycin
as an immunosuppressant that modified host innate or
adaptive cellular immunity, facilitating virus infection
for oncolytic virotherapy with myxoma virus, but
rapamycin was not used as a treatment itself [61]. Our
study demonstrated the high therapeutic efficacy of
two mTOR inhibitors on suppressing tumor growth on
subcutaneous GBC tumor models. At the regimens and
doses studied, both rapamycin and WYE-354, were
well tolerated with no significant weight loss or adverse
effects, suggesting the toxicity of these inhibitors is low
at least under the studied conditions. It is likely that the
better therapeutic response observed in mice treated with
rapamycin compared to WYE-354-treated mice was
strongly related to the treatment regimen. Although both
treatments significantly inhibited tumor growth compared
to their controls, a prolonged- low dose treatment with
rapamycin was clearly more effective at decreasing
tumor mass than a short- term treatment with a higher
dose of WYE-354. Hu et al. [19] observed that the rate
of tumor growth in preclinical animal models of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma increased on days without
rapamycin treatment. This observation and our results
may imply that a continuous a long term treatment may
provide better outcomes in inhibiting tumor growth than
a short term and cyclical treatment regimen.

It has been widely studied that the positive regulation
of AKT by mTORC2 leads to mTOR acting both upstream
and downstream from AKT [16, 62]. Unlike WYE-354,
rapamycin does not directly inhibit mTORC2, due to the
FRB domain on mTORC not being accessible on mTORC2
[63, 64]. However, the remarkable therapeutic response
observed in our study with rapamycin treatment may be in
part due to the fact that a prolonged rapamycin treatment
inhibits mTORC2 in some types of human cancer cells
by preventing mTORC2 complex assembly, blocking
the phosphorylation of its substrate AKT at Ser473 [51,
60]. The fact that the better anti- tumor effect observed
in rapamycin-treated mice was accompanied with a
greater decrease in the phosphorylation status of P70S6K
suggests a more effective mTOR pathway inhibition
[19, 52, 53]. However, both inhibitors only partially
inhibited phospho-P70S6K in most tumors treated. This
could suggest that the antitumor effect of these drugs is
likely to be indirect. Some studies have shown that the effect
might be via targeting normal cells [65]. Lkb1+/− mice
treated with rapamycin showed a reduction in gastric
tumor burden and in the number of polyps per mouse.
Yet, the phosphorylation of ribosomal P70S6 kinase
in the polyps from the treated mice was maintained.
However, a significant reduction in microvessel density
was seen in these polyps [59]. Systemic rapamycin
treatment of mammary tumors grown in Cav-1 KO mice
not only inhibited tumor growth but also stromal content
and angiogenesis [66]. Checkley et al., reported that
rapamycin inhibited skin tumor promotion accompanied
with a significantly decrease in the number of infiltrating
macrophages, T cells, neutrophils, and mast cells in the
dermis [67].
Tumor mass reduction observed in both rapamycin
and WYE-354 treated groups was associated with fewer
vascularized tumors than in the controls. Several studies
have established that the antitumor efficacy of rapamycin
and its rapalogs as well as pyrazolopyrimidines such
as WYE-354 can be attributed partly to a reduction in
HIF1-alpha expression, which is an activator of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene transcription
[38, 46, 68–71]. In conclusion, our findings provide a
proof of concept for the use of mTOR pathway-targeted
therapies as potentially good candidates in clinical trials
in advanced GBC patients.

were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis in 4%–12% NuPAGE® Bis-Tris
Precast Gels (Novex, Life Technologies Corporation) and
electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Immobilon®-P membrane Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
The membranes were blocked with 1 × Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.05% Tween (TBST) and 5% fat-free milk for
1 hour at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4°C
with primary antibodies. After washing with TBST, the
membranes were further incubated with the corresponding
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
for 1 hour at room temperature. Antibody-bound protein
bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence
reagent SuperSignal West Pico Substrate (Pierce). Images
were acquired on a Thermo Scientific myECL Imager.
β-actin expression was used as a loading control.

mTOR inhibitors
Rapamycin inhibitor (R-5000) was purchased from
LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA) and WYE-354
(A10114) was purchased from Adooq Bioscience LLC
(Irvine, CA, USA). For in vitro assays the inhibitors
were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide as stock
solutions and stored at −20°C. Inhibitors were diluted
in culture medium before each in vitro experiment and
0.01% dimethylsulfoxide in culture medium was used
as a vehicle control. For in vivo studies rapamycin was
formulated in 4% ethanol, 5.2% Tween 80 and 5.2% PEG
400, while WYE-354 was formulated in 5% ethanol, 5%
Tween 80 and 5% PEG 400 and stored at −20°C.

Cell viability assays

Antibodies

G-415 and TGBC-2TKB cell lines were plated onto
96 well plates at a density of 2 × 103 cells per well. After
an overnight attachment period cells were treated with
WYE-354. The number of viable cells was determined at
certain intervals using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution
Cell Proliferation assay (Promega Corp., Madison, WI).
Briefly, 20 μl CellTiter 96 solution was added to each
well and the plates were incubated for 2 hour after which
the absorbance of each well was read at a wavelength of
490 nm using a multiwell plate reader (Autobio Labtec
Instruments Co, Ltd, Zhengzhou City, People’s Republic
of China). All assays were performed in quintuplicate, and
each assay was repeated three times.

Rabbit monoclonal antibodies, anti-P70S6K (#2708)
and anti-phospho-P70S6K (Thr389, #9234) anti-eIF4E
(#2067), anti-phospho-eIF4E (Ser209, #9741), anti4E-BP1 (#9644), anti-phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46,
#2855) and anti-β-actin (#4970) were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology and used for Western blot
analysis. The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit
IgG horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc.). Mouse monoclonal antibody anti-Ki67 (Clone
MIB1 DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) was obtained from
Dako, Agilent Technologies and rabbit monoclonal
antibody anti-phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46, #2855) was
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and used for
immunohistochemical staining.

Transwell cell migration and invasion assays
Migration assays were performed using 24-well
Transwell™ plates containing polycarbonate filters with
an 8 μm pore size (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA).
Cells were exposed to WYE-354 (1 μM), rapamycin
(50  nM) and 0.01% dimethylsulfoxide (as control) for
12 hours at 37°C. Complete medium was placed in the
lower chamber to act as a chemoattractant and G-415 or
TGBC-2TKB cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 104
or 5 × 104 cells, respectively, with serum-free medium into
the upper chamber. After 24 hours, the cells were fixed
in methanol for 15 minutes and then stained with 0.05%
crystal violet in 25% methanol/PBS for 15 minutes. Cells
on top of the membrane were removed using a cotton
swab, and the filters were washed with PBS. Cells on the
underside of the filters were viewed and counted under a
microscope in 6 randomly selected fields. Invasion assays
were performed as for the migration assays described
above, except inserts were pre-coated with Matrigel
(Corning® Matrigel® Growth Factor Reduced (GFR)
Basement Membrane Matrix, #356230) at concentrations
of 20 μg for G-415 and 10 μg for TGBC2-TKB cell lines.

Western blot analysis
For in vitro assay, cells were seeded on 75 cm2
culture plates. At 60–70% confluency the cells were
treated with WYE-354 (1 μM), rapamycin (50 nM), and
0.01% dimethylsulfoxide (as control) for 18 hours. Cell
lysate was prepared using RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich
Co, St Louis, MO, USA). Briefly, cells were washed three
times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed
on ice with RIPA buffer containing a phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF), protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich Co, St Louis, MO, USA). For
in vivo experiments, tumor lysates were prepared on ice
using cell lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl,
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA) containing a
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (SigmaAldrich Co, St Louis, MO, USA). Whole lysates were
collected after centrifugation at 8,000g for 10 minutes
at 4°C. Protein concentrations were determined using a
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s

In vivo studies on subcutaneous tumors

Data analysis was performed with the GraphPad Prism 5
(GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego CA).

8 to 12-week- old NOD-SCID mice (obtained from
the animal facility of the Georg Speyer Haus, Frankfurt,
Germany) were subcutaneously injected in one flank with
either 2 × 106 or 5 × 106 cells of G-415 or TGBC2TKB,
respectively, and re-suspended in 200 μl of PBS with 30%
of Matrigel (Matrigel™ Basement Membrane Matrix, BD
Biosciences). When the average tumor reached 100 mm3,
mice were randomly separated into four groups and treated
with rapamycin or WYE-354 and its respective vehicles.
Rapamycin was administered at a daily intraperitoneal (i.p)
dose of 10 mg/kg for 5 days per week for 3 weeks, while
WYE-354 was administrated at a daily i.p dose of 50 mg/kg
for 5 days. Tumor volumes were estimated twice a week from
caliper measurements (volume = 0.52 × (width)2 × length).

work.

Xenograft tumors were freshly removed, fixed
in 10% buffer formalin and subsequently embedded
in paraffin. The sections were manually stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for normal histological
evaluation. 3 μm-thick sections were deparaffinized with
Histo-Clear (National Diagnostics; Atlanta, GA, USA) and
rehydrated through alcohol gradient. Heat-induced antigen
retrieval was performed by immersing slides in Tris/EDTA
pH 9.0 buffer (10 mMTris, 1 mM EDTA) for 20 min at
99°C in a thermo-regulated bath.
Automated staining was performed using an antibody
against Ki67 antigen (Clone MIB1 DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark) at a dilution of 1:100. Ki67 index was measured
using the open access web application ImmunoRatio for
automated image analysis [40] using 3–10 images per
sample, depending on tumor size and excluding necrotic
areas. Statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired
Mann Whitney test using GraphPad Prism v. 5 (GraphPad
Software, Inc. San Diego CA).
An immunohistochemical analysis of phospho-4EBP1
was performed on the xenograft tumors tissues using the
antibody Phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) (236B4) Rabbit mAb
#2855 (Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of 1:400.
All samples were processed simultaneously under the same
conditions using an autostainer.
