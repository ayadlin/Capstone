Abstract
The use of probe substrates and combinations of ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter knockout (KO) animals may
facilitate the identification of common substrates between
apparently unrelated ABC transporters. An unexpectedly low
concentration of the purine nucleotide analogue, 9-(2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl)-adenine (PMEA), and up-regulation of
Abcg2 in some tissues of the Mrp4 KO mouse prompted us to
evaluate the possibility that Abcg2 might transport purinederived drugs. Abcg2 transported and conferred resistance to
PMEA. Moreover, a specific Abcg2 inhibitor, fumitremorgin C,
both increased PMEA accumulation and reversed Abcg2mediated PMEA resistance. We developed Mrp4 and Abcg2
double KO mice and used both single KOs of Abcg2 and Mrp4
mice to assess the role of these transporters in vivo. Abcg2
contributed to PMEA accumulation in a variety of tissues, but
in some tissues, this contribution was only revealed by the
concurrent absence of Mrp4. Abcg2 also transported and
conferred resistance to additional purine analogues, such as
the antineoplastic, 2-chloro-2¶-deoxyadenosine (cladribine)
and puromycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor that is often
used as a dominant selectable marker. Purine analogues
interact with ABCG2 by a site distinct from the prazosin
binding site as shown by their inability to displace the
substrate analogue and photoaffinity tag [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin. These studies show that Abcg2, like Mrp4, transports
and confers resistance to purine nucleoside analogues and
suggest that these two transporters work in parallel to affect
drug cytotoxicity and tissue distribution. This new knowledge
will facilitate an understanding of how Abcg2 and Mrp4,
separately and in combination, protect against purine
analogue host toxicity as well as resistance to chemotherapy.

Introduction
The concept of substrate overlap among ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters is well known in cell culture models (1, 2).
However, direct extrapolation of these findings to in vivo models is
difficult because of an inability to attain expression levels
comparable with in vivo. One approach to test for functional

interactions among ABC transporters is to evaluate both substrate
and transporter tissue distribution in knockout (KO) animals. We
speculated that if two transporters showed similar tissue
distribution and patterns of up-regulation in each others absence,
then it was likely they shared similar endogenous or drug
substrates. Mrp4 (also known as Abcc4) and Abcg2 have similar
patterns of tissue distribution (3, 4). Mrp4 was first identified as a
transporter of nucleoside monophosphates [primarily purine
nucleoside monophosphates; e.g., 9-(2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl)adenine (PMEA); ref. 5], but more recent studies have indicated
that Mrp4 transports substrates in common with Abcg2, most
recently camptothecin analogues (6, 7). Because Abcg2 also
transports and confers resistance to camptothecin analogues
(8, 9) as well as steroid-like compounds and antifolates (e.g.,
methotrexate), we postulated that the substrate specificities of
Mrp4 and Abcg2 may overlap to a greater extent than previously
appreciated.
In our Mrp4 KO mouse, Mrp4 absence had no effect on PMEA
accumulation in the brain and prompted us to look for
compensatory changes in other ABC transporters. We discovered
up-regulation of Abcg2 and then showed that ABCG2 transported
PMEA and conferred resistance to the cytotoxic effects of PMEA.
These studies were extended to test if absence of either or both
Abcg2 and Mrp4 altered the tissue concentrations of PMEA (10).
These experiments were conducted in the Mrp4 KO (Mrp4 / ;
ref. 6), the Abcg2 KO (Abcg2 / ; ref. 11), and the Mrp4 and Abcg2
double KO (DKO) mouse developed recently in our laboratory. We
then tested if other purine analogues were Abcg2 substrates. One
purine analogue, 2-chloro-2¶-deoxyadenosine (2-CdA), is of particular relevance. 2-CdA is frequently used for treatment of leukemia
(12) and this is notable because Abcg2 (Bcrp) is expressed at higher
levels in certain subtypes of leukemia (13). These studies show,
using KO mice and cells engineered to express ABCG2, that Mrp4
and Abcg2 affect not only the in vivo drug tissue concentrations of
purine analogues but also the sensitivity of cells to the cytotoxic
effects of purine analogue antiviral and cancer chemotherapeutic
agents. The therapeutic implications of these results are 2-fold.
First, both Abcg2 and Mrp4 may reduce the antiviral and cytotoxic
effects of these drugs. Second, the inhibition of Mrp4 and Abcg2
may increase the therapeutic efficacy of purine-derived chemotherapeutics.

Fumitremorgin C (FTC) was kindly provided by Dr. Susan Bates (National
Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Cell culture. Human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos2, was cultured in
DMEM containing 10% FCS and 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. ABCG2-overexpressing Saos2
cells (Saos2-ABCG2) and the empty vector control cell line, Saos2 pcDNA3.1
cells, have been reported previously (14). The MCF-7/FLV1000 cells were
kindly provided by Dr. Susan Bates.
Animals. Female wild-type (WT), Mrp4 / (6), Abcg2 / (11), and Mrp4/
Abcg2 DKO mice were used. DKO mice were obtained by crossbreeding of
Mrp4 / and Abcg2 / mice. All mice were from a mixed C57BL/6 129SVJ
background and were bred and maintained at St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
Isolation of splenocytes from mice. Spleens were isolated from WT
and Mrp4 / mice followed by isolation and culture of splenocytes as
described previously (15). Briefly, fresh isolated organs were meshed and
passed through a strainer (70 Amol/L) to separate fibrous tissue. The splenic
cells were kept in culture medium composed of RPM1 1640, 10% fetal
bovine serum, 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.0), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (1)
nonessential amino acids, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and 50 mmol/L
2-mercaptoethanol. After lysis of RBC, the splenic cells were incubated with
radiolabeled drug for 6 h.
Immunoblot analysis. As described previously, cell and tissue homogenates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the following antibodies: Mrp4
(M4I-10), Abcg2 (BXP-53, Alexis Biochemicals), and h-actin (6). Protein
concentration was quantified by using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

serum albumin (BSA) as standard. Whole-cell lysates and homogenates
(100 Ag) were separated on 7.5% or 10% polyacrylamide gels. The membrane
was blocked and incubated with the primary antibody at the appropriate
dilution and then with an anti-rat IgG, horseradish peroxidase–linked whole
antibody (Amersham Bioscience). Signals were developed using the
Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. Densitometry
analysis of bands was done by Scion image (Scion Corp.),5 and the ratio of
KO to WT was determined after normalization by the actin signal.
Intracellular accumulation of drugs. Saos2-ABCG2 cells and vector
control cells were seeded at 5  105 per well in six-well plates and grown
overnight. Cells were incubated with labeled drugs for the indicated time
and at the indicated concentrations. Radioactivity in the samples was
measured by liquid scintillation counting. Values were normalized to total
protein content as described (16).
Cytotoxicity assay. Cells were seeded at 5,000 cells per well in 96-well
plates and cultured at 37jC for 20 h. The cells were incubated with drugs for
6 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated without drugs
for 3 to 4 days. The viability of cells was determined by CellTiter 96
Nonradioactive Cell Proliferation assay (Promega). The percentage of
growth for treated cells, compared with untreated cells, was calculated. An
inhibitory concentration was determined and represented an amount of
drug that inhibited cell proliferation by 50% (IC50). Online software was
used to calculate the IC50 using Java Applets & Servlets for Biostatistics
(programmed by H. Ono, Nagoya City University, Nagoya City, Japan). Each

Substrate Overlap between Mrp4 and Abcg2/Bcrp
assay included duplicate samples for each drug concentration, and all
experiments were done at least twice.
Photoaffinity labeling of ABCG2. [125I]IAAP (specific activity, 2,200
Ci/mmol) labeling was done as described previously (17). Briefly, a mixture
of 30 Ag crude membrane protein from MCF-7/FLV1000 cells (expressing
the R482wt form of human ABCG2) containing (18 nmol/L) [125I]IAAP in
the absence or presence of PMEA, puromycin, or prazosin was photo crosslinked with UV light (365 nm). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE,
and gels were dried followed by exposure to X-ray film overnight at 80jC.
Pharmacokinetic experiments of PMEA. Mice were injected with
[3H]PMEA (12 ACi and 20 mg/kg of body weight) via the tail vein. Mice were
sacrificed at 6 h after injection. Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture,
and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min.
Selected tissues (brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, ovary, and thymus)
were collected and homogenized in a 4% (w/v) BSA solution. The level of
radioactivity was determined in the homogenates by liquid scintillation
counting.
Statistical analysis. A two-sided Student’s t test was used to determine
the statistical significance between experimental groups and differences
were considered significant when P was <0.05.
Clinical chemistries and biochemical analysis. A sample of blood was
collected from anesthetized mice by retro-orbital sinus puncture, and
serum was obtained after centrifugation. The blood cells were analyzed by
using an automated blood cell analyzer, a Hemavet 3700 from Drew
Scientific. Biochemical analyses were done by using a chemistry analyzer, a
Vet Scan from Abaxis.

Results
Mrp4 absence increases PMEA concentrations in select
tissues. The amount of MRP4 expressed is inversely correlated
with the PMEA concentration in cells in vitro (18). To evaluate the

contribution of Mrp4 to PMEA tissue concentration in vivo,
Mrp4 / and WT mice received an i.v. dose of 20 mg/kg [3H]PMEA.
Subsequently, plasma and tissues were evaluated for the amount of
radioactivity. Relative to WT mice, the Mrp4 / mice accumulated
greater levels of radioactivity in spleen, thymus, lung, and kidney
(the average ratio of Mrp4 / to WT mice was 2.3, 1.5, 1.4, and 1.3,
respectively. Fig. 1A). The accumulation of PMEA was also dose
related because at 40 mg/kg, the average ratio of Mrp4 / to WT
was 3.3 in the spleen. In particular, PMEA accumulation in spleen
of Mrp4 / mice was significantly higher than that of WT mice in
accordance with the in vivo accumulation of topotecan in the
spleen of the Mrp4 / mouse (6). Notably, the plasma levels of
PMEA were not significantly different between Mrp4 / and WT
mice (Fig. 1B).
To directly test the role of Mrp4 in PMEA accumulation, we
isolated splenocytes and incubated them with various concentrations of the PMEA prodrug, [3H]Bis(POM)PMEA. Bis(POM)PMEA has been used by us and others to bypass the PMEA uptake
carrier OAT1 (5, 18, 19). As shown in Fig. 1C, splenocytes from
Mrp4 / mice accumulated significantly higher concentrations of
PMEA (2.5-fold) compared with splenocytes from WT mice (P <
0.01). In addition, 100 Amol/L indomethacin, an inhibitor of Mrp4,
dramatically elevated PMEA accumulation in splenocytes of
WT mice to levels achieved in splenocytes from the Mrp4 / mice
(Fig. 1D). These studies showed that Mrp4 strongly contributes to
PMEA accumulation in the spleen.

functionally related ABC transporters (20). We used the Abcg2 /
and Mrp4 / mice to test this possibility because Mrp4 and Abcb2
have similar tissue distribution patterns. Compared with WT mice,
Mrp4 / mice showed higher expression of Abcg2 in the spleen
and brain (Fig. 2A). In contrast, spleen and thymus from Abcg2 /
mice had higher Mrp4 expression compared with WT mice
(Fig. 2B), suggesting that Mrp4 is up-regulated in an apparent
attempt to compensate for the loss of Abcg2 expression.
ABCG2 transports and confers resistance to the purine
prodrug, Bis(POM)PMEA. The expression of Abcg2 in Mrp4 /
mouse brain was elevated, but penetration of PMEA was no
different between Mrp4 / and WT mice (Fig. 1A). These findings
led us to test the hypothesis that Abcg2 transports PMEA. To
determine if PMEA is an Abcg2 substrate, an uptake assay was
conducted using either Saos2 cells expressing human WT ABCG2
(Saos2-ABCG2) or empty vector (Saos2 vector). Mrp4 levels were
low in these cells as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A,
inset). We used [3H]Bis(POM)PMEA as described above and

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

previously (5, 21) to determine intracellular PMEA accumulation.
Depending on the concentration of Bis(POM)PMEA used, the
Saos2-ABCG2 cells showed 3- to 4-fold lower intracellular drug
accumulation compared with the Soas2 vector cells [10 Amol/L
Bis(POM)PMEA; P = 0.03; Fig. 3A]. Moreover, the specific Abcg2
inhibitor, FTC (at 10 Amol/L), increased [3H]PMEA accumulation
f5-fold in Saos2-ABCG2 cells (Fig. 3B). We further tested if the
intracellular concentration of PMEA was related to the amount of
ABCG2 (Fig. 3C). We used two cell lines with different amounts
of ABCG2 (Fig. 3C, inset) and discovered that the concentration
of PMEA was related to the amount of ABCG2. Subsequently,
we evaluated whether ABCG2 affected PMEA cytotoxicity using
a lactate dehydrogenase release assay. Saos2-ABCG2 cells were >9fold less sensitive to Bis(POM)PMEA compared with vector
transfectants [IC50, 219 Amol/L (Saos2-ABCG2) versus 26.1
Amol/L (vector); Fig. 3D]. Increasing the PMEA incubation from
6 to 20 h resulted in a modest reduction in the IC50 for vector
cells (15.7 Amol/L) and a 4-fold reduction for the ABCG2 cells

(53.4 Amol/L). Furthermore, FTC reversed ABCG2-mediated PMEA
resistance.
Mrp4 and Abcg2 in combination and separately contribute
to tissue distribution of PMEA. We next determined how the
absence of either Abcg2 or both Mrp4 and Abcg2 affected tissue
distribution of PMEA in vivo. DKO mice were developed by
interbreeding Mrp4 / and Abcg2 / mice. The DKO mice are
viable, fertile, and grow as expected. Clinical chemistry and
hematologic analysis revealed no gross disruption of mature
myeloid or lymphoid elements and no organ dysfunction
(Supplementary Table S1). Thus, under the normal housing
conditions at this institution, the DKO had normal physiologic
variables. The mice received an i.v. dose of 20 mg/kg [3H]PMEA,
and 6 h later, plasma and tissues were harvested. Plasma
concentrations of PMEA were no different among WT, Abcg2 / ,
and DKO mice (data not shown) and similar to the concentrations
for the Mrp4 / animals (Fig. 1B). However, the absence of
Abcg2 alone increased the PMEA concentration in the liver
(1.4), kidney (1.4), brain (1.25; see Supplementary Fig. S1),
and ovary (2.5; Fig. 4; see Supplementary Fig. S1). DKO mice
showed higher PMEA concentration than Abcg2 / mice among
the liver (1.3), kidney (1.3), and heart (1.25; see Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that, in these tissues, Mrp4 and Abcg2
exert a combined effect on PMEA accumulation. In contrast,
PMEA accumulation in the spleen and lungs seems unaffected by
Abcg2 absence (Fig. 4), whereas, in DKO mice (relative to

Figure 4. Abcg2 and Mrp4 individually and separately contribute to PMEA
tissue concentrations. [3H]PMEA (20 mg/kg) was given by tail vein into mice.
At 6 h, mice were sacrificed and radioactivity in the indicated tissues was
determined by scintillation counting. Accumulation in liver (A ), kidney (B), spleen
(C ), and lung (D ) of WT, Abcg2 / mice, and DKO mice. Columns, mean (n = 3);

Agcg2 / ), the spleen (1.6) and lung (1.4) showed higher
concentration of PMEA. These data indicate that Mrp4
predominantly affects PMEA concentration in these tissues
(Fig. 4). This interpretation agrees with our finding in Mrp4 /
mice shown above (Fig. 1). Notably, these data indicated that
Abcg2 influences PMEA brain concentration to an extent similar
to mitoxantrone, a known Abcg2 substrate (22). Together, these
data show that both Mrp4 and Abcg2 affect PMEA tissue
distribution in peripheral tissues, but only the absence of Abcg2
increases PMEA brain penetration.
ABCG2 transports and confers resistance to puromycin and
2-CdA. Many purine analogues act as antimetabolites and are
potent and effective immunosuppressants and chemotherapeutic
agents. Although puromycin is not used clinically, it is used as a
dominant selectable marker in some mammalian expression
vectors (23). We assessed puromycin uptake to determine if it is
a substrate of ABCG2. As shown in Fig. 5A, Saos2-ABCG2 cells
accumulated 2-fold less [3H]puromycin compared with vector
cells (P < 0.01). FTC (10 Amol/L) blocked puromycin efflux and
effectively enhanced [3H]puromycin accumulation in Saos2ABCG2 cells to concentrations similar to those found in Saos-2
vector cells (Fig. 5A, inset). These studies were extended to
determine if Abcg2 conferred resistance to the cytotoxic effects of
puromycin. The Saos2-ABCG2 cells exhibited over a 6-fold
increase in puromycin resistance [IC50, 52.7 Amol/L (Saos2ABCG2) versus 8.0 Amol/L (vector); Fig. 5B] and ABCG2-mediated
puromycin resistance was completely reversed by FTC (10 Amol/L;
Fig. 5B ), thus indicating that ABCG2 reduced intracellular
puromycin concentration, which directly affects puromycin cytotoxicity.
2-CdA is a stable analogue of deoxyadenosine, an agent commonly used to treat lymphoid and other malignancies (24, 25). An
evaluation of the effect of ABCG2 expression on 2-CdA uptake
revealed that ABCG2 strongly reduced the rate of 2-CdA accumulation in Saos-2-ABCG2 cells (P = 0.01 at 60 min; Fig. 5C). We
then evaluated if ABCG2 conferred resistance to 2-CdA. As shown
in Fig. 5D, Saos2-ABCG2 cells were 5-fold more resistant to 2CdA compared with vector-only transfectants [IC50, 1,273.7 Amol/L
(Saos2-ABCG2) versus 261.4 Amol/L (vector)]. Moreover, coaddition of FTC completely reversed the ABCG2-mediated resistance.
These studies indicate that ABCG2 reduces the intracellular concentration of purine analogues and this corresponds to a reduction
in cellular cytotoxicity.
PMEA does not compete with IAAP for binding to the
ABCG2 protein. To determine if the nucleosides interact with
known substrate binding sites, we used the substrate analogues
[125I]IAAP. Prazosin, a known substrate of WT ABCG2 (1),
specifically competes with its photoaffinity analogue [125I]IAAP to
reveal one of the ABCG2 substrate binding sites (26). To evaluate
whether PMEA and puromycin interact with the [125I]IAAP binding
site, we labeled membranes from ABCG2-expressing cells (MCF-7/
FLV1000) with [125I]IAAP in the presence of PMEA and puromycin
(Fig. 6A and B). Whereas prazosin readily blocked [125I]IAAP
labeling, neither PMEA nor puromycin up to 25 Amol/L had any
affect on [125I]IAAP labeling of ABCG2, thus showing that these
purine nucleoside analogues do not potently compete with IAAP
for binding to ABCG2 (Fig. 6A and B). The prodrug Bis(POM)PMEA
was also ineffective in displacing IAAP (data not shown). These
studies indicate that puromycin and PMEA interact with a site on
Abcg2 that is distinct from the prazosin binding site described
previously (17, 26).

Discussion
Purine nucleosides are highly effective chemotherapeutic agents,
but their effectiveness may be limited by the concentration achieved
in a target cell or organ. One mechanism to reduce cellular
accumulation and retention of the purine nucleotide analogues was
first attributed to the efflux capabilities of the ABC transporter
Mrp4 (ABCC4; refs. 5, 18, 27, 28). The current study reveals, for the
first time, that, in addition to Mrp4, the ABC transporter and
hematopoietic stem cell marker Abcg2 (11, 29) also regulates the
intracellular concentration of purine analogues (e.g., PMEA).
Moreover, the up-regulation of Abcg2 in the Mrp4 KO mouse and
the recent findings that both Mrp4 and Abcg2 transport cGMP (30)
support the proposal that these genes functionally overlap and
compensate for one another. This functional overlap and compensation has important therapeutic implications for the therapeutic
use of purine analogues because they are effective as both antivirals
and cancer chemotherapeutic agents.
From a practical standpoint, it is notable that puromycin is
transported by ABCG2. We propose, based on the puromycin
resistance of our ABCG2-expressing cells, that the recommended

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

range of concentrations of puromycin used to select for resistant
cells (100–1,000 Amol/L) might lead to the adventitious overexpression of endogenous Abcg2 and circumvent the usual mode of
acquiring puromycin resistance (i.e., inactivation by puromycin
N-acetyltransferase). Consequently, it is possible that cells, selected
for puromycin resistance, might acquire overexpression of
endogenous Abcg2 and express a phenotype due to Abcg2. Abcg2
can protect against cell stresses (e.g., hypoxia) and cytotoxic agents
(e.g., topoisomerase inhibitors as well as methotrexate and purine
analogues). Therefore, we offer a caveat that the cell phenotypes
obtained after puromycin drug selection may be related to
acquired capabilities attributable to Abcg2 expression rather than
the gene under selection.
PMEA is an acyclic purine nucleoside phosphonate analogue
that is versatile and highly effective against various viruses, such as
herpes, EBV, hepatitis B (HBV), retroviruses, and cytomegalovirus,
and some cancers (31–36). The PMEA derivatives, Bis(POM)PMEA
and tenofivir, are effective in treating patients infected with HBV
(37, 38). Resistance to PMEA in HBV-infected patients is associated
with viral rebound (39), which in rare cases results from mutations

Substrate Overlap between Mrp4 and Abcg2/Bcrp

in the HBV polymerase gene (40). The mechanism of cellular
PMEA resistance is complex. However, extrusion of nucleotide
analogues by ABC transporters has been reported as a mechanism
of acquired drug resistance in cell lines selected for PMEA
resistance (5). Our current studies extend this to show that both
Abcg2 and Mrp4 (independently and together) reduce intracellular
PMEA concentrations. These findings have implications for the
treatment of HBV infection, especially because there is a strong
link between liver cancer and HBV infection—the lifetime risk for
developing liver cancer in a chronically infected person is 10% to
25% (41). Thus, it is a formal possibility that Mrp4 and Abcg2, by
decreasing hepatic purine nucleotide concentrations, impair the
effectiveness of PMEA against HBV, which leads to chronic HBV
infection.
A major dose-limiting toxicity of PMEA (also known as adefovir)
is renal toxicity (37, 42). Adefovir nephrotoxocity would require
renal tubular uptake by the organic anion transporter OAT1 (43);
however, renal excretion has been proposed as rate limiting to
nephrotoxicity (44). Our studies show that both Mrp4 and Abcg2
reduce renal PMEA concentration and support the idea that
excretion is rate limiting as no difference is observed in the
expression of the PMEA uptake carrier OAT1 (data not shown).
Furthermore, as both ABCG2 and Mrp4 protect against PMEA
cytotoxicity (this article and refs. 5, 28, 45), their location on the
apical side of the proximal tubules can facilitate excretion of PMEA
into the urine. However, it remains to be tested how Mrp4 and Bcrp
individually contribute in vivo to protect against renal toxicity of
PMEA derivatives. Nevertheless, it is notable that another apical
renal transporter, Mrp2, does not affect kidney elimination of
PMEA (46).
2-CdA is a purine nucleoside analogue that is converted
intracellularly to nucleotide analogues and has been successfully
used for the treatment of myeloid malignancies (12). Nitrobenzylthioinosine is a compound that can increase the intracellular

concentration of 2-CdA nucleotide metabolites (47). Wright et al.
(48) reported enhanced intracellular retention of 2-CdA and its
metabolites in an erythroleukemia cell line by 0.5 Amol/L
nitrobenzylthioinosine. Our study provides the first evidence that
ABCG2 reduces intracellular 2-CdA accumulation and confers
2-CdA resistance. Moreover, preliminary studies indicate that
nitrobenzylthioinosine inhibits ABCG2 (data not shown). Thus,
leukemia cells expressing ABCG2 might be less sensitive to 2-CdA
and we speculate that leukemias expressing high levels of ABCG2
as well as MRP4 (45) may be refractory to 2-CdA due to extrusion
of metabolites.
An understanding of the substrate binding sites of ABC
transporters is essential for identifying mechanisms of multidrug
resistance, drug-drug interactions, and the design of specific
inhibitors. As reported previously, some ABC transporters, such as
P-glycoprotein, Abcg2, Mrp2, and Mrp4, have more than one
substrate binding site (26, 49–51). Shapiro et al. (52) showed three
distinct substrate binding sites for P-glycoprotein. In addition, the
binding site of methotrexate for Mrp4 is different from that of
urate, which provides a convenient explanation for the inhibition
of methotrexate transport by urate (51). In our studies, we
evaluated if PMEA and puromycin interact with the prazosin
binding site on ABCG2 by testing how these compounds reduced
[125I]IAAP labeling. Neither puromycin nor PMEA [and Bis
(POM)PMEA; data not shown] up to 25 Amol/L reduced
[125I]IAAP labeling of Abcg2, thus suggesting that both PMEA
and puromycin do not compete with the [125I]IAAP binding site
on ABCG2. This is analogous to daunomycin, mitoxantrone,
rhodamine 123, and methotrexate, all of which are ABCG2
substrates but are ineffective in competing with [125I]IAAP
labeling (17, 26). These findings lend further support to the
concept that Abcg2 has more than one substrate binding site.
Determining the identity of this binding site may provide insight
into the development of ABCG2 inhibitors that might selectively
affect substrates.
In conclusion, our results not only extend the list of ABC
transporters that efflux purine analogues to include Abcg2 but
also reveal how Mrp4 and Abcg2, in combination and separately,
affect tissue concentrations of purine analogues in vivo. Although
our studies are important for hematologic malignancies (Abcg2 is
highly expressed in hematopoietic progenitors; refs. 11, 29) and
especially for the chemotherapy of leukemias in which 2-CdA is
used, these findings have important implications for antiviral
therapy because not only can MRP4 and ABCG2 potentially affect
renal toxicity of PMEA derivatives but both MRP4 and ABCG2
may affect the concentration of PMEA in liver. Currently, PMEA
derivatives are highly effective against HBV; however, our studies
imply that these two transporters may combine to reduce the
accumulation of PMEA analogues, thus contributing to the
reduced antiviral efficacy and increasing the possibility that
persistent HBV infections may progress to HBV-initiated liver
cancer.
