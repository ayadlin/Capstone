Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1
in Human Cancer
Concise Review and Rationale for Development of IMC-18F1 (Human Antibody Targeting
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)*
Jonathan D. Schwartz, MD; Eric K. Rowinsky, MD; Hagop Youssoufian, MD; Bronislaw Pytowski, PhD; and Yan Wu, PhD

The human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1, or Flt-1) is widely expressed in normal and pathologic tissue and contributes to the pathogenesis of both neoplastic and inflammatory diseases. In human cancer,
VEGFR-1 mediated signaling is responsible for both direct tumor activation and angiogenesis. VEGFR-1 mediated activation of nonmalignant supporting cells, particularly stromal, dendritic, hematopoietic cells, and macrophages, is also
likely important for cancer pathogenesis. VEGFR-1 is also hypothesized to enable the development of cancer metastases by means of activation and premetastatic localization in distant organs of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic
progenitor cells, which express VEGFR-1. IMC-18F1 is a fully human IgG1 antibody that binds to VEGFR-1 and has been
associated with the inhibition of cancer growth in multiple in vitro and human tumor xenograft models. The preliminary results of phase 1 investigations have also indicated a favorable safety profile for IMC-18F1 at doses that confer
antibody concentrations that are associated with relevant antitumor activity in preclinical models. Cancer 2010;116(4

VEGFR-1 Overview
The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF) family is comprised of the ligands placental growth factor
(PlGF), VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D, and the receptors VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3. VEGF-A
interaction with VEGFR-2 (fetal liver kinase 1 [Flk-1], kinase insert domain-containing receptor) has been demonstrated
to be an essential modulator of tumor angiogenesis based on the results of an extensive range of human and preclinical
investigations.1 VEGFR-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 [flt-1]) interacts with and is activated by the ligands PlGF, VEGFA, and VEGF-B. Although VEGF-A is known to bind and activate both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, VEGFR-1 is the only
known receptor for the ligands PlGF and VEGF-B (Fig. 1).2,3 VEGFR-1 differs from other members of the VEGF receptor family in that it is expressed as a soluble variant because of an alternative splicing event.
VEGFR-1 is expressed on the endothelial cells lining tumor blood vessels, myoepithelial (stromal) cells, and on
human cancer cells of diverse tumor origin.4 Immunohistochemical studies have indicated frequent VEGFR-1 expression
in multiple human malignancies, including breast, nonsmall cell lung, squamous cell head and neck, prostate, pancreas,
ovarian, colon, bladder, hematologic, and other cancers.2,5,6 VEGFR-1 expression in resected breast cancer and early stage
nonsmall cell lung cancer has been associated with shorter survival.7,8
VEGFR-1 in Carcinogenesis and Cancer Pathogenesis
VEGFR-1 activation has been implicated in both investigational carcinogenesis and tumor pathogenesis. Constitutive
activation of VEGFR-1 results in fibroblast transformation and morphogenesis.9 In colorectal cancer models, VEGFR-1

up-regulation and phosphorylation occur in conjunction
with epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT),
associated with progression to an invasive phenotype, and
VEGFR-1 signaling is essential for the survival of transformed carcinoma.10 VEGFR-1 signaling in a pancreatic
cancer model has been shown to cause epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, characterized by loss of cellular
polarity, pseudopod formation, and increased intercellular separation mediated by cytoplasmic translocation of Ecadherin and beta-catenin.11 VEGFR-1 signaling in colorectal cancer cells causes activation of mitogen-activated
protein kinase and stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun
NH2-terminal kinase, and mitogen- activated protein kinase and PI3-kinase/Akt signaling in breast cancer cells.
VEGFR-1 signaling increases cell motility and invasiveness and reduces apoptotic indices in in vitro breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer models.12-15
VEGFR-1 and Cancer Angiogenesis
The role of VEGFR-1 in malignant angiogenesis has
remained uncertain, in part because the receptor has substantially weaker tyrosine kinase activity than VEGFR-2,
and exhibits a 10-fold higher binding affinity for VEGFA.16,17 It has been hypothesized that VEGFR-1 may act as
a decoy receptor that sequesters circulating VEGF-A and
thereby diminishes VEGFR-2 signaling; this view is based
on the expression of the alternatively spliced soluble
VEGFR-1 and on the viability of mice that express non-

1028

signaling VEGFR-1 (deleted kinase domain).18,19 However, VEGFR-1 signaling has been shown to increase
endothelial activity and angiogenesis in both in vitro and
animal models. Activation of VEGFR-1 by VEGF-A and
PlGF enhances endothelial migration and survival;
VEGFR-1 antagonist peptides reduce in vitro endothelial
migration and capillary tube formation.20-22 VEGFR-1
signaling increases tumor angiogenesis in PlGF-expressing
Lewis lung carcinoma murine xenografts.18 Inhibition of
VEGFR-1 by inhibitory antibodies or peptides reduces
in vivo angiogenesis of human epidermoid A431 and
SW480 colorectal cancers.23,24 Activation of VEGFR-1
by PlGF has been shown to cause VEGFR-1/VEGFR-2
heterodimerization and transphosphorylation in endothelial cells, resulting in enhanced VEGF-mediated VEGFR2 signaling and angiogenesis.25
VEGFR-1 Specific Ligands PlGF and VEGF-B
The VEGFR-1 specific ligand PlGF is up-regulated in
human cancer and disruption of PlGF signaling inhibits
cancer growth. Increased PlGF expression has been
observed in advanced (vs localized) colorectal cancer, and
has been associated with shorter survival in patients with
advanced (stage III-IV) colorectal cancer.26 PlGF expression is up-regulated in breast cancer; after resection with
curative intent, patients whose tumors demonstrated
higher PlGF expression had reduced disease-free survival.27 PlGF expression has also been observed in

means of a specific anti-PlGF antibody reduces tumor
growth in B16 melanoma, Panc02 pancreatic, and CT26
colorectal cancer xenograft models.31
The VEGFR-1-specific ligand VEGF-B is among
the least well-characterized members of the VEGF family,
although some studies indicate that it is up-regulated in
cancer. VEGF-B expression correlates with the presence
of lymph node metastases and shorter disease-free and
overall survival in a small number of breast cancer series.7,32 VEGF-B expression has also been observed in
conjunction with aggressive phenotypic features, including vascular invasion in hepatocellular cancer and
increased microvessel density in oral squamous
cancer.33,34

VEGFR-1 and Tumor Inflammation
VEGFR-1 expression and signaling in inflammatory and
other non-neoplastic cells may contribute to cancer pathogenesis (Fig. 2). Tumor inflammation and the presence of
VEGFR-1 expressing tumor infiltrating macrophages
correlates with a more aggressive clinical phenotype in
human breast cancer and other malignancies, although
the specific contribution of VEGFR-1 mediated signaling
in this setting has not been elucidated.35,36 VEGFR-1
activation in endothelial cells and macrophages has been
shown to promote pulmonary metastases by means of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) up-regulation in Lewis
lung carcinoma and B16 melanoma xenografts.37 Ligandmediated activation of VEGFR-1 causes up-regulation of
angiogenic factors FGF, SDF1, PDGF, and others by tumor-associated macrophages and stromal cells.38 Antibody-mediated PlGF inhibition decreases recruitment of

VEGFR-1 Expressing Hematopoietic
Progenitor Cells and Cancer Metastasis
VEGFR-1 is expressed by circulating bone marrowderived hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). These
cells have been shown to function as essential components
of experimental tumor metastasis.39 These circulating
progenitor cells, which also express CD34, CD11b, and
other hematopoietic markers, interact with the tumor
microenvironment before the development of metastases,
and they elicit integrin alteration and growth factor upregulation that enable tumor implantation and recruitment of VEGFR-2 expressing endothelial progenitors,
essential for angiogenesis and growth.40 Antibody-mediated VEGFR-1 inhibition significantly reduces both the
premetastatic localization of HPCs expressing VEGFR-1
and the development of metastasis in BB16 melanoma
and Lewis lung carcinoma xenograft models.41 The localization of HPCs in advance of the arrival of circulating
cancer cells has been termed the ‘‘premetastatic niche.’’
Interactions between tissue fibronectin and the integrin
VLA-4 (a4b1; also expressed on VEGFR-1 positive
HPCs) and degradation of basement membranes by
HPC-derived MMP-9 are also essential for premetastatic
HPC localization and metastasis formation.
Development, Preclinical, and Preliminary
Clinical Experience With IMC-18F1 (Human
Anti-VEGFR-1 Antibody)
Because of the significant association of VEGFR-1 with
carcinogenesis and tumor pathogenesis, the high-affinity,
human IgG1, anti-VEGFR-1 antibody IMC-18F1 has
been developed as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent. IMC18F1 was developed using anti-VEGFR1-producing hybridomas generated from human IgG transgenic mice,
with specific selection and additional polymerase chain
reaction amplified subcloning resulting in generation of
full-length IgG1 with potent and specific blockade of
human VEGFR-1. Recombinant IMC-18F1 binds to
VEGFR-1 with high affinity (Kd ¼ 5.0  1011M) and
inhibits ligand binding with an IC50 (concentration that
inhibits 50% of ligand binding or cell proliferation) of 0.2
to 1.2 nM. IMC-18F1 does not bind to or recognize
VEGFR-2 or murine VEGFR-1. Because IMC-18F1

1030

interacts exclusively with the human VEGFR-1, the rat
anti-murine anti-VEGFR-1, MF1 was developed to better
study potential anti-endothelial and anti-stromal mechanisms in human tumor murine xenograft models. In these
xenografts, IMC-18F1 activity is confined to direct inhibition of VEGFR-1 on tumor cells, and MF1 inhibits
VEGFR-1 activity on host (murine) elements such as
stroma and blood vessels. The use of both antibodies in
combination enables an assessment of activity that may
better approximate activity in human cancer.
IMC-18F1 monotherapy has been associated with
growth inhibition in several murine human breast cancer
xenograft models including MDA-MB-435, DU4475,
and MDA-MD-231 tumors. In several of these xenograft
models, the addition of MF1 (specific to the murine
VEGFR-1) conferred additional growth inhibition, suggesting that VEGFR-1 inhibition impaired both direct
tumor growth (via the IMC-18F1 component) and angiogenesis (or effect on stromal or other host-derived tumor
supporting mechanisms, by means of the antimouse MF1
component). In MDA-MD-231 xenografts, the IMC18F1/MF1 combination augmented the growth inhibition associated with the cytotoxic agents 5-fluorouracil,
doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide in several xenograft
investigations. The combination of IMC-18F1 and MF1
also conferred enhanced growth inhibition when combined with IMC-DC101 (antimurine VEGFR2) in
MDA-MD-231 xenografts. In the MDA-MD-231
xenograft models, antitumor activity of IMC-18F1 was
observed when plasma concentrations were maintained in
the range of 88 to 200 mg/mL (or above), with average
interdose plasma concentrations in the range of 200 to
319 lg/mL.3
Phase I investigation of IMC-18F1 has indicated a
favorable adverse event profile across a range of schedules
and intravenous doses. Krishnamurthi and colleagues
have administered IMC-18F1 at weekly doses of 2, 3, 6,
12, and 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and 20 mg/kg every 3
weeks. Preliminary pharmacokinetic analyses indicate
that doses of 12 mg/kg/week generate serum trough levels
comparable to (or greater than) those associated with anticancer activity in preclinical models. IMC-18F1 related
adverse events and serious adverse events have occurred
infrequently; a maximum tolerated dose has not been
identified.42
Summary/Conclusion
VEGFR-1 inhibition via IMC-18F1 may impede cancer
growth via several mechanisms, including direct tumor

inhibition, inhibition of angiogenesis, and more indirect
mechanisms involving inhibition of VEGFR-1 signaling
on circulating hematopoietic precursor cells, tumor-infiltrating macrophages, and stromal cells, which have been
associated with cancer pathogenesis in diverse investigational models. Preclinical investigation of IMC-18F1
(and the antimouse counterpart MF-1) has resulted in inhibition of cancer growth in several in vivo models; more
robust growth inhibition has occurred with combination
IMC-18F1/MF-1 therapy, suggesting that both antitumor and antiangiogenic mechanisms are operant. When
combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy, IMC-18F1 (or
IMC-18F1/MF1) was associated with enhanced growth
inhibition in some xenograft models. Preliminary clinical
studies to date have indicated a favorable safety profile
associated with IMC-18F1 monotherapy.
