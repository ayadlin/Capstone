ABSTRACT
Background & Aims: Less than 10% of registered drug intervention trials
for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) include a biomarker stratification
strategy. The ability to identify distinct mutation subsets via endoscopic ultrasound
fine needle aspiration (EUS FNA) molecular cytology could greatly aid clinical trial
patient stratification and offer predictive markers. We identified chemotherapy
treatment naïve ampullary adenocarcinoma and PDAC patients who underwent EUS
FNA to assess multigene mutational frequency and diversity with a surgical resection
concordance assessment, where available.
Methods: Following strict cytology smear screening criteria, targeted next
generation sequencing (NGS) using a 160 cancer gene panel was performed.
Results: Complete sequencing was achieved in 29 patients, whereby 83
pathogenic alterations were identified in 21 genes. Cytology genotyping revealed
that the majority of mutations were identified in KRAS (93%), TP53 (72%), SMAD4
(31%), and GNAS (10%). There was 100% concordance for the following pathogenic
alterations: KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, KMT2D, NOTCH2, MSH2, RB1, SMARCA4, PPP2R1A,
PIK3R1, SCL7A8, ATM, and FANCD2. Absolute multigene mutational concordance
was 83%. Incremental cytology smear mutations in GRIN2A, GATA3 and KDM6A
were identified despite re-examination of raw sequence reads in the corresponding
resection specimens.
Conclusions: EUS FNA cytology genotyping using a 160 cancer gene NGS
panel revealed a broad spectrum of pathogenic alterations. The fidelity of cytology
genotyping to that of paired surgical resection specimens suggests that EUS FNA
represents a suitable surrogate and may complement the conventional stratification
criteria in decision making for therapies and may guide future biomarker driven
therapeutic development.

INTRODUCTION

4.) multigene mutation concordance between paired EUS
FNA cytology smears and surgical resection specimens.

Conventional non-targeted chemotherapy regimens
are the standard of care for patients with ampullary (AA)
and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Yet, clinical
trials frequently offer targeted agents to patients without
screening for actionable pathogenic alterations. Less
than 10% of registered drug intervention trials for PDAC
include a biomarker stratification strategy. [1] The five
most commonly mutated genes of PDAC in the Catalogue
of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database are
KRAS (71%), TP53 (49%), CDKN2A (22%), SMAD4
(20%), and ARID1A (6%). [1] In 2014, the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) created a scientific framework for
PDAC with 4 initiatives. [2] The objective of one of these
initiatives was to expand PDAC research to develop new
approaches that interfere with RAS oncogene dependent
signaling pathways. RAS can activate several downstream
effectors, including the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and the RASRAF-MEK-ERK pathways, which are involved in cell
survival and proliferation.
Evolving novel therapeutic strategies include agents
that not only target the tumor itself, but also the tumor
microenvironment. Such unique or combined approaches
include vaccine based immunotherapy, the use of stromal
depleting agents, BRCA related therapies, inhibitors
of autophagy, angiogenesis inhibition and NOTCH
signaling pathway inhibitors. [3–5] Genetic signatures
could be used to direct personalized PDAC treatment in
the future. [6]
The ability to identify distinct mutation subsets via
endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration (EUS FNA)
molecular cytology could greatly aid clinical trial patient
stratification for optimal therapy selection and offer
predictive markers. Such a development would represent
a crucial step in the field of personalized medicine. It has
been observed that tumors characterized by a concurrent
TP53 and SMAD4 wild type status have an indolent
behavior and an improved therapy response with low
metastatic potential. [7, 8] However, TP53 mutant tumors
accompanied by a SMAD4 wild type profile exhibit
increased metastatic potential, and finally a combination of
TP53 and SMAD4 mutations represent the most aggressive
and widespread metastatic PDAC. Therefore, stratification
of cytotoxic agent eligible patients using EUS FNA
specimens to determine the multigene mutation status may
be of prognostic benefit and facilitate appropriate tumor
specific targeted therapy.
The aims of our translational study using a
commercially available 160 gene targeted NGS
comprehensive cancer panel were to determine among
a cohort of patients with chemotherapy treatment naïve
AA and PDAC the 1.) multigene mutational landscape
within EUS FNA cytology smear specimens, 2.) spectrum
of functional gene groupings, 3.) frequency and subtype
of KRAS, TP53 and SMAD4 pathogenic alterations and

RESULTS
Clinical demographics
Targeted NGS was achieved in 29 chemotherapy
naïve patients [65.4 ± 13.4 years, male gender n=19
(65.5%)]. Three (10.3%) patients were < 45 years of age
at the time of diagnosis. A family history (≥ 1 first degree
relative) of PDAC was notable for 3 (10.3%) patients.
Smoking status at the time of FNA included never smokers
[n=13 (44.8%)] and ex or current smokers [n=16 (55.3%)]
with a 13.5 (5-20) pack year history. The Ca19-9 level
at diagnosis was 88 (30-260) U/mL [normal < 55U/mL:
n=17 (58.6%) > 55 U/mL]. The fasting serum glucose
level was 112 (96-153.5) mg/dL (normal 70-100 mg/dL),
17 (62.1%) of whom had a level > 100 mg/dL at diagnosis.

Tumor demographics
The cohort was comprised of the following:
PDAC [n=21 (72.4%); 20 primary and 1 recurrent], AA
[n=4 (13.8%)], malignant transformation of intraductal
papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) [n=3 (10.3%)],
and Lynch Syndrome associated PDAC [n=1 (3.4%)].
The tumors were located within the pancreatic: head
[n=19 (65.5%)], body [n=5 (17.2%)], ampulla [n=4
(13.8%)], and complete gland infiltration [n=1 (3.4%)].
The median tumor size at EUS was 3cm (2.5-4.1). The
spectrum of subsequent surgical intervention included the
following: pancreaticoduodenectomy [n=20 (69%)], distal
pancreatectomy [n=5 (17.2%)], total pancreatectomy [n=3
(10.3%)], and a completion pancreatectomy for a patient
with recurrent disease [n=1 (3.4%)].

Disease recurrence and mortality
Disease recurrence developed in 17 (58.6%)
patients at 13 (7.7-21.5) months following EUS FNA. The
initial site of tumor recurrence was liver [n=6 (35.3%)],
peritoneum [n=5 (29.4%)], lung [n=2 (11.8%)], malignant
ascites [n=2 (11.8%)], a new primary [n=1 (5.9%)], and a
cutaneous chest drain site [n=1 (5.9%)]. Twenty (68.9%)
patients died at a median of 17.8 (10.9-32.6) months.
Overall follow up from the time of EUS FNA to mortality
or to the end of the study was 22.9 (10.9-42.6) months.

Cytology genotyping using a commercially
available comprehensive cancer panel
Targeted NGS sequencing revealed that 83
pathogenic alterations were identified in 21 genes.

Genotyping revealed that the majority of mutations were
identified in KRAS (93.1%), TP53 (72.4%), SMAD4
(31%), and GNAS (10.3%). (Table 1) All patients with
GNAS mutations had concurrent KRAS and TP53 comutations. No somatic P16 mutations were identified.

identified in either current or former smokers. Overall
survival for patients with a KRAS mutation was 24.2 (13.844.6) months. Neither Gly12Val (HR = 0.6292; 95% CI
0.2505 to 1.5807; p=0.36) or Gly12Asp (HR = 0.9956;
95% CI 0.3829 to 2.5887; p=0.99) status was associated
with disease related mortality. Two KRAS wild-type
(WT) patients harbored mutations in TP53 and FBXW7,
respectively.

Characterization of the TP53 mutational profile
Twenty-one patients harbored 20 TP53 mutations
including 15 missense mutations, 2 nonsense mutations,
1 splice site mutation, 1 in-frame deletion and 1 single
base pair duplication resulting in a premature stop codon
(Supplementary Table 2). TP53 was the second most
frequently identified pathogenic alteration in patients, 19
(90.5%) and 5 (23.8%) of whom had either a KRAS or
SMAD4 co mutation.

Characterization of the KRAS mutational
profile
The observed KRAS mutations were composed
of alterations in codons 12, 13 and 61 in 85.2%, 3.7%
and 11.1%, respectively. The most frequently identified
genotypes were Gly12Val (33%) and Gly12Asp (33%)
(Figure 1). Alterations in codons 13 and 61 were only

Paired cytology NGS with matched surgical
pathology NGS patients revealed 56 and 50 pathogenic
alterations, respectively, in 19 and 16 genes. Five
(27.8%) patients had ≥ 4 pathogenic alterations identified
per tumor. KRAS (94.4%), TP53 (66.7%) and SMAD 4
(38.9%) were the most frequently identified pathogenic
alterations. Fifteen of 18 (83.3%) paired patients had
absolute multigene mutational concordance (Table
3). There was 100% concordance for the following
individual pathogenic alterations: KRAS, TP53, SMAD4,
KMT2D, NOTCH2, MSH2, RB1, SMARCA4, PPP2R1A,
PIK3R1, SCL7A8, ATM, and FANCD2. Mutations in
GRIN2A (p. Val1197Met) (allele frequency = 14%),
GATA3 (p. Ala102Thr) (allele frequency = 6%), GNAS
(p.Gly282Ser) (allele frequency = 5%) and KDM6A (p.
Gln524Ter) (allele frequency = 7%) were only identified
within the EUS FNA cytology specimens from three
patients despite careful re-examination of the of the raw
sequence reads in the resection specimens (Figure 2). The
estimated tumor % in these 2 patients for FFPE versus
cytology specimens were similar (70% vs. 70% and 70%
vs. 30%, respectively). Overall, the average mutant allele
frequencies in paired FFPE versus cytology samples
with concordant mutations were 35% versus 34%, also
suggesting similar tumor percentage between FFPE and
cytology samples.

genomic analyses have identified that there are 12 core
signaling pathways and 16 genes significantly genetically
altered in the majority of PDAC patients. [10–11] We
have previously reported a 50 gene mutation assessment
of a spectrum of other primary, locally advanced and
metastatic diseases using EUS FNA cytology specimens.
[9, 12–16] Our newly presented data represent a
multigene mutation assessment of 160 cancer associated
genes using targeted NGS. This unique assessment
further exemplifies the collective genetic diversity
of PDAC - AA and may be used to identify specific
molecular patient cohorts most likely to benefit from
agents designed to target specific pathways or genomic
features. [17]
The ability to apply targeted NGS to routine EUS
FNA cytology offers tremendous promise for such an
endeavor in an evolving era of individualized medicine.
We have observed a broad spectrum of pathogenic
alterations in 21 genes, whereby 93% of patients had ≥ 2
pathogenic alterations per tumor. This further highlights
the clear need for customized combination therapy with
the goal of enhancing therapeutic response and patient
outcome.
The performance of KRAS mutation analysis
in EUS FNA pancreas mass specimens from a variety
of molecular techniques is well documented. [18–23]
However, we report that an EUS FNA molecular
cytology assessment with targeted NGS has the ability
to identify and dissect KRAS mutation subtypes as
part of a multigene mutation analysis. Furthermore,
EUS FNA identified that 31% of our cohort harbored a
SMAD4 mutation and they were more likely to harbor

additional pathogenic alterations when compared to
their WT counterparts. We did not observe currently
“druggable” mutations within the evaluated cohort
as the following were of wild type status: BRAF,
PIK3CA, BRCA, PALB2, ERBB1, MET, FGFR1, and
EGFR. Nevertheless, our discoveries could be applied
to prospective clinical trials and aid a combined
phenotypic-genotypic approach to facilitate the
development of precision medicine.
These are the first data from a commercial 160
cancer gene panel demonstrating that EUS FNA cytology
specimens provide an ideal surrogate to surgical
specimens for detecting pathogenic alterations associated
with PDAC and AA. This information is key given the
narrow cohort that would undergo a surgical biopsy and
the necessity for pre-operative delivery of personalized

tumor specific care. Interestingly, we identified that the
observed cytology mutational spectrum was broader than
that of the corresponding surgical pathology specimens.
Mutations in GRIN2A, GATA3 and KDM6A which
have been identified in melanoma, breast cancer and
recently identified as a candidate driver of pancreatic
carcinogenesis, respectively, were only identified within
the EUS FNA cytology smear specimens. [24–26] The
absolute multigene mutational profile concordance was
83%. This may in part be a reflection upon the tumor
microenvironment which is otherwise referred to as
desmoplasia or stroma and is comprised of immune
cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, vascular
components and a dense extracellular matrix. [27] Up
to 90% of a PDAC tumor mass is composed of the
aforementioned desmoplastic stroma which can make

the evaluation of tumor cells within a histopathologic
specimen challenging. [28] Cytology FNA specimens
have the potential to capture more mutations due to the
natural concentration of tumor cells in such specimens,
as the less cohesive tumor cells may be extracted
while the residual dense stromal matrix is excluded.
Furthermore, intratumoral heterogeneity represents a
variation in tumor behavior between varying sites within
the same tumor. We speculate that tumor heterogeneity
may have been responsible for the additional mutations
detected in 3 cytology specimens. This morphological
variation between regions within a tumor has long
been familiar to histopathologists but is now gaining
increased recognition among clinicians as it may
partially account for an impaired treatment response.
EUS FNA has the potential to sample cells from a
greater number of regions within a tumor than a single
FFPE section due to the multiple FNA passes obtained
from the tumor in question during an EUS procedure. All
of these procedural and sample preparation factors favor
EUS FNA as a more sensitive technique for detecting
molecular alterations within desmoplastic tumors.
This is a small but fruitful study of archived EUS
FNA specimens to illustrate tumor genetic diversity, but

if completed on a larger scale could define subgroups
with distinct biologic behaviors and even compare and
contrast individuals with pancreas adenocarcinoma and
separately those with ampullary adenocarcinoma. In
an attempt to overcome molecular cytology adequacy
challenges, we adhered to strict cytology and FFPE
slide screening protocols to qualify samples likely to
have a successful NGS. By so doing, it reduced the
numbers of patients available to us for evaluation. This
therefore prompts the future refinement not only of
rapid on site evaluation (ROSE) for cytology adequacy
parameters but also corresponding metrics for ROSE
molecular adequacy assessments. If such “molecular
adequacy” parameters were determined within the
procedure room, it could ensure that superior material
is obtained for molecular testing than is currently the
standard of care for diagnostic purposes only. From
a very practical perspective, the turnaround time for
molecular diagnostic testing from biopsy procurement
to delivery of test results needs to be minimized, if it
is to become useful and relevant in a clinical setting.
Cancer gene panels are limited to mutation assessment,
which although very generous at 160 genes for this
particular study, commercial panels most often do

not include assessments of chromosomal translocations
and copy number variants, which would certainly
broaden our understanding of an individual tumor’s
biologic behavior.
In summary, our study has demonstrated the ability
to use a moderate-large targeted NGS cancer gene panel in
cytology smear specimens obtained via EUS from PDAC
and AA patients as a suitable surrogate for surgically
acquired specimens. Such cytology specimens may in
fact deliver incremental genetic diversity information.
Stratification of patients and targeting of therapy as per
NCI initiatives is essential to further expand the developing
field of personalized medicine in a truly heterogeneous
patient population. The combination of a molecular
prognostic and targeted therapy sensitivity grouping
may complement the conventional clinicopathologic risk
stratification criteria in decision making for clinically
based or clinical trial neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies
and guide biomarker driven therapeutic development.

Multiplex PCR was performed by amplifying 10
ng of DNA in each of 4 separate PCR reactions using a
commercial Human Comprehensive Cancer GeneRead™
DNAseq Targeted Panel V2 (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA)
per manufacturer protocol. This panel is a collection of
multiplexed PCR primer assays for targeted enrichment
of the coding (exonic) regions of the 160 genes (7,951
amplicons) that are most frequently mutated in
malignancy with an identifiable oncogenic consequence
(Supplementary Table 3).
The PCR products underwent library preparation
using the TruSeq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit
(Illumina, San Diego, CA) as recommended by the
manufacturer starting with the end repair reaction. For
the Human Comprehensive Cancer Panel, up to 12
samples were pooled equimolar and underwent 2x100bp
sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq instrument using the
200 cycle Rapid v2 Reagent Kit (Illumina, San Diego,
CA). Internal laboratory studies demonstrated 5-10%
analytical sensitivity for mutant alleles at a minimum of

Patient population

Data analysis

Following Mayo Clinic IRB approval, primary
malignancy DNA was extracted from 47 chemotherapy
naïve patients from archived (2009-2013) molecular
cytology single slide smear specimens. The surgical stage
pathology grouping was as follows: Ia (7%), Ib (10%),
IIa (14%), IIb (62%), III (4%) and IV (3%). Perineural
invasion was identified in 13 (44.8%) patients and an
R0 status was established in 26 (89.7%) patients. All
selected slides had ≥ 20% tumor cells in a background of
benign nucleated cells. The use of strict screening criteria
allowed the exclusion of 13 patients with insufficient DNA
quantity (< 5 ng/μl). (9) Targeted NGS was performed from
the remaining 34 patients, of whom 18 had paired matched
surgical pathology specimens with sufficient material for a
multigene mutation concordance evaluation.

Following sequencing completion on the Illumina
NGS instrument, the raw sequence reads were extracted
and demultiplexed with Illumina CASAVA (Consensus
Assessment of Sequence And Variation) program (version
1.8.2) to generate FASTQ files. Sequence FASTQ files were
aligned to human genome build hg19 using the CLC BIO
Genomics Server (version 6.0) program to produce BAM
files. The alignment files were analyzed by the CLC BIO
Genomics Server quality and probability variant detection
program within a custom bioinformatics pipeline running
on the Linux cluster. The Single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) or insertions/deletions (INDELs) with an allele
frequency ≥ 5% were manually reviewed and interpreted.

Statistical analyses

DNA extraction process

Continuous variables were reported as mean and
standard deviation or median and interquartile range and
compared by using the Student t test or Mann Whitney
U test. Categorical variables were reported as frequency
(%) and were compared by either a 2-tailed Fisher exact
test or Pearson χ2 test, where appropriate. Progression
free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from EUS
FNA to any objective evidence of disease progression or
death, whichever occurred first. Cox proportional hazards
model was performed to estimate PFS data. All tests
were 2-sided, with P ≤ .05 as the criterion standard for
determining significance. The statistical software package
JMP Version 11 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and MedCalc
version 10 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium)
were used for statistical analysis.

Cytology smear slides were immersed in xylene
for 1-5 days until the coverslip detached. Following
rinsing in 95% ethanol, all cellular material from a
single slide per patient was scraped with a sterile razor
and placed into 1.5 ml tubes. Cytology slide DNA was
isolated using the QIAmp DNA Micro kit and FFPE
unstained slide DNA was extracted using the QIAamp
DSP DNA FFPE Tissue kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA).
DNA samples were quantified using the Qubit® dsDNA
BR assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as per
standard protocol. Extraction yielded 21.0 ng/μl of DNA
on average (range 0-88.7) for cytology smear specimens
and 66.9 ng/μl of DNA (range 9.3-164) on average for
FFPE specimens.
