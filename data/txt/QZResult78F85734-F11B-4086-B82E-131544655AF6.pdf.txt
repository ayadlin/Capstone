ABSTRACT
To overcome cancer cells resistance to pharmacological therapy, the development
of new therapeutic approaches becomes urgent. For this purpose, the use of poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in combination with other cytotoxic agents could
represent an efficacious strategy. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is a posttranslational modification that plays a well characterized role in the cellular decisions
of life and death. Recent findings indicate that PARP-1 may control the expression
of Snail, the master gene of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Snail is highly
represented in different resistant tumors, functioning as a factor regulating antiapoptotic programmes. MDA-MB-231 is a Snail-expressing metastatic breast cancer cell
line, which exhibits chemoresistance properties when treated with damaging agents. In
this study, we show that the PARP inhibitor ABT-888 was capable to modulate the MDAMB-231 cell response to doxorubicin, leading to an increase in the rate of apoptosis.
Our further results indicate that PARP-1 controlled Snail expression at transcriptional
level in cells exposed to doxorubicin. Given the increasing interest in the employment
of PARP inhibitors as chemotherapeutic adjuvants, our in vitro results suggest that one
of the mechanisms through which PARP inhibition can chemosensitize cancer cells in
vivo, is targeting Snail expression thus promoting apoptosis.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a
transdifferentiation program that is required for tissue
morphogenesis during embryonic development and
abnormally activated during tumor progression [4–6].
Through EMT, epithelial cells lose their cell-cell adhesion
molecules, their polarity, rearrange their cytoskeleton
and become prone to migrate [7]. Recent evidence now
indicates that EMT of tumor cells not only promotes the
development of metastases, but also contributes to drug
resistance [8–12]. Ultimately, Snail, the fundamental
member of the family of Snail transcriptional factors
[13], has emerged as factor able to increase the resistance
of cancer cells [14, 15]. It has been demonstrated that
aberrant expression of Snail promotes resistance to

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor
in women. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment
approaches, the mortality due to breast cancer still remains
very high. This is attributable to the fact that cancer cells are
able to develop mechanisms of resistance to the therapeutic
treatment, a process known as chemoresistance [1, 2]. In
particular, the treatment of some kind of triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC) -so called because the cancer cells
lack receptor for estrogen (ER-) and progesterone (PR-) and
do not express the human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2-)- is quite complex because to an initial response
follows a resistance to therapy [3].

programmed cell death in MCF-7 cells elicited by
doxorubicin [14]. Moreover, Snail has been reported to be
sufficient to promote mammary tumor recurrence in vivo
and high levels of Snail predict decreased relapse-free
survival in women with breast cancer [16]. Other studies
have shown that Snail confers resistance to cell death
induced by lack of survival factors and by pro-apoptotic
signals [17] and that Snail downregulation increases cell
death in colon tumors in a mouse model [18]. Snail exerts
its function not only through the repression of epithelial
genes such as CDH1 (E-cadherin) [19] but also through
repression of multiple factors with important functions in
apoptosis such as TP53, BID, and Caspase-6 [14, 20] or
PTEN, a negative effector of the PI3K pathway [21].
Snail expression is regulated at transcriptional level
by growth factors and various signaling molecules [22]
as well as by Snail protein itself [23]. In addition, some
post-translational modifications influence Snail stability,
subcellular localization and activity [24–26]. Moreover, it
has been shown that the expression of Snail can be directly
activated by the enzyme PARP-1 at transcriptional level
[27] and that the modification of Snail by PARP activity
stabilizes Snail protein at post-translational level [24].
Recent findings have revealed that PARP-1 plays
a role in EMT and metastasis formation by affecting the
expression of epithelial and mesenchymal genes [28–31].
To investigate the relationship between PARP-1 and Snail,
we have to keep in mind the pleiotropic actions of PARP-1.
PARP-1 is an abundant and ubiquitous nuclear enzyme [32,
33], which is implicated in multiple pathways involved in
the regulation of gene expression [34–39]. In response to
stresses that are toxic to the genome, PARP-1 binds single
or double-stranded DNA breaks and its activity increases
with the aim to maintain genomic integrity [40, 41].
Massive PARP-1 activation, however, consumes NAD+
and ATP, leading to energy failure and cell death [42, 43].
A delicate PARP-1 activity equilibrium exists within cells
where any deviation, either hyper- or hypo-activity can
change the cell decision of life or death [44]. PARP-1 is
an attractive anticancer target [45, 46] and PARP inhibitors
used as monotherapy, induce cell death in tumors with
non-functional homologous recombination because of
defective BRCA pathways [47–49]. PARP inhibitors are
also used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents
to strengthen the effect of DNA damage in sporadic
tumors [50–52]. As previously described [53–55], PARP
inhibitors, when used in combination with doxorubicin
(doxo), are able to chemosensitize p53-mutated, TNBC
MDA-MB-231 cells. In this paper, we aim to explore
whether this chemosensitizing effect may depend on
the regulation of Snail transcription by PARP-1. As
expected, the combined doxo-ABT-888 treatment led to
an increase in the rate of apoptosis. We show that Snail
levels, which were upregulated by doxo treatment, were
decreased by ABT-888 addition or by depletion of PARP1. The involvement of PARP-1 in Snail transcription was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

further demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) and luciferase assays. The milder upregulation
observed upon combined doxo/ABT-888 treatment or
PARP-1 depletion appeared to be crucial for releasing
PTEN suppression, a key negative regulator of PI3K/
Akt activity. The lower activation of PI3K/Akt pathway
resulted in the reduction of the survival signaling. Our data
reveal potential implications in the use of PARP inhibitors
in combination with doxo in therapeutic intervention of
some chemoresistant Snail-expressing tumors.

RESULTS
ABT-888 treatment and PARP-1 depletion
sensitize MDA-MB-231 cells to doxo-induced
apoptosis
Doxo has multiple effects on tumor cells, including
DNA damage, and prolonged exposure to this agent causes
the activation of the apoptotic program in most of cancer
cell lines [56]. However, some cells are able to escape
apoptosis and develop resistance to drug treatment [57]. We
aimed to evaluate the apoptotic response of MDA-MB-231
cells and its dependence on PARP inhibition. Since we
obtained similar results using different PARP inhibitors,
here we decided to use ABT-888, a novel PARP inhibitor
that has been reported to make the tumor more likely to
respond to radiation and chemotherapy [58]. MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with either 1 μM doxo, or 0.5 μM ABT888, or a combination of both drugs for 24–48 h.
The presence of apoptotic cells was examined by
FACS analysis, counting all the Annexin V positive cells
in the right squares of each panel in Figure 1A. A moderate
increase in the number of apoptotic cells was evident in
doxo-treated vs untreated cells at 24 and 48 h. Conversely,
the number of Annexin V positive cells significantly
increased at 24 and 48 h of combined treatment with doxo
and ABT-888 (up to 2.6-fold vs untreated cells) (Figure 1B).
Accordingly, when the effect of doxo and ABT-888, alone
or in combination, was evaluated in terms of clonogenic
ability, the combined treatment resulted in a significant
reduction in clonogenic ability of MDA-MB-231 cells (9%
survival fraction) with respect to doxo alone (27% survival
fraction) or ABT-888 alone (85% survival fraction) (data
not shown).
Consistently, only cells exposed to doxo and ABT888 for 24 h exhibited an increased level of cleaved PARP1 (detected with clone mAb C2–10), a widely sensitive
indicator of caspase-mediated apoptotic cell death, and
a concomitant increase in γH2AX formation, which is
indicative of an unrepaired damage (Figure 1C).
Then we assessed whether also the depletion of
PARP-1 caused the same outcome of the PARP inhibitor
ABT-888 in terms of apoptosis. After siRNA-mediated
silencing of PARP-1, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with
doxo for 24 and 48 h and apoptosis was evaluated by the

increase of apoptosis (about 3 fold) in cells silenced for

Concomitant with this effect, a higher induction of γH2AX
was detectable after 24 h of doxo treatment in siPARP-1
cells with respect to control cells (Figure 1E).
Collectively, these data indicate that reduction of PARP
activity may enhance the killing effect of doxo on tumor cells
and that this effect may primarily depend on PARP-1.

Although the mechanisms of apoptosis are complex,
there is accumulating evidence to suggest that Snail
is an important component in defining the response of
tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents [15]. Since the
PARylation process has been correlated to the modulation
15010

of Snail level [24, 27], we aimed to evaluate its role in
Snail expression during doxo treatment in MDA-MB-231.
Cells were treated with either doxo 1 μM, or ABT-888
0.5 μM or a combination of both drugs at different times
(2 h, 7 h and 24 h). As shown by Western blot analyses
(Figure 2A), Snail levels increased in a time-dependent
manner upon treatment with doxo, while the combined
treatment with both doxo and ABT-888 resulted in a
milder induction. This decrease in Snail level is significant,
as revealed by densitometric analyses in Figure 2B.
PAR level is quite high in our untreated cells probably
because of the higher rate of basal PARP-1 activity, often
observed in cancer cells [59]. However, the efficacy of
PARP inhibition was confirmed by PAR disappearance in
presence of ABT-888 alone or in combination with doxo.
Real-Time PCR analyses were performed to determine
whether the variation of Snail protein was correlated to
changes of its mRNA expression. Figure 2C shows that
SNAI1 mRNA levels significantly upregulated in a timedependent manner after doxo treatment, reaching very
high levels at 24 h (114 fold increase vs untreated cells)
while cotreated cells showed a decrease in SNAI1 mRNA
levels (30 + 7% at 24 h). The SNAI1 mRNA levels of
ABT-888 treated cells did not show a significant difference
compared to untreated cells.
To assess whether PARP-1 was involved in the
modulation of Snail induction after doxo treatment,
MDA-MB-231 cells were silenced for PARP-1 by 48 h
of siRNA transfection and then treated with doxo for 7 h.
Western blot analyses (Figure 2D) indicate a considerable
reduction of Snail level after doxo treatment in PARP-1depleted cells with respect to control cells. Densitometric
analysis shows that Snail decrease is significant (Figure
2E). Again, Real-Time PCR analysis indicates that the
sharp increase of SNAI1 mRNA level upon doxo treatment
in siCT cells was significantly reduced in PARP-1-silenced
cells (Figure 2F).
Then we compared the effects of doxo and ABT888 treatments on Snail expression in the two additional
TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157, and
in the epithelial cell line MCF-7. Regarding the triple
negative cells, while MDA-MB-468 cells exhibited a
time-dependent consistent increase in Snail protein and
mRNA level in response to doxo (Supplementary Figure
1A and 1B), MDA-MB-157 cells exhibited a significant (5
fold) increase only at 24 h of doxo treatment with respect
to untreated cells (data not shown). Notably, both triplenegative cancer cells showed a significant reduction of
the doxo-induced Snail level in cells cotreated with ABT888 and doxo, suggesting a positive effect of the PARP
inhibitor as antitumor agent in this subset of breast tumors.
In spite of the low basal Snail level, also MCF-7 cell line
evidenced an increase in Snail protein and mRNA level
upon doxo treatment, (less consistent at mRNA level than
in MDA-MB-231 cells), which was counteracted by ABT888 cotreatment (Supplementary Figure 1C, 1D).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Collectively, these results indicate that PARP-1
regulates Snail expression following doxo treatment.

PARP activity affects PARP-1 binding and
histone H3 modifications profiles at SNAI1 locus
in doxo-exposed MDA-MB-231 cells
Snail promoter contains an E-box motif, defined
as the binding site of PARP-1 located within the SnailILK responsive element (SIRE) sequence [27, 60]. To
investigate whether Snail promoter activity directly
responds to PARP-1, the transfection with a luciferase
reporter construct [61] carrying the human Snail promoter
was combined with the silencing of PARP-1 in MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 3A). The depletion of PARP-1
expression at 48 h from siRNA transfection was controlled
by Western blot (data not shown). Snail promoter activity
was measured after exposure of transfected cells to doxo for
7 h. We noticed that doxo treatment resulted in an increase
in Snail promoter activity in control samples, which was not
observed in PARP-1 depleted samples. This result shows
that PARP-1 depletion negatively regulated Snail promoter
activation induced by doxo and this is in agreement with the
expression of endogenous Snail, which was downregulated
at protein and mRNA level (Figure 2D, 2F).
To obtain information about the direct role played
by PARP-1 in SNAI1 expression in MDA-MB-231
cells, ChIP assays were performed to analyse PARP1 interactions with the promoter and the 3′ enhancer
(Figure 3B), a region that is reported to control the
expression of Snail in melanoma cells A375 [62].
Analyses were performed in MDA-MB-231 cells treated
for 7 h with either doxo 1 μM, or ABT-888 0.5 μM or
a combination of both drugs. As shown in Figure 3C,
PARP-1 occupied the promoter and enhancer regions
both in presence and in absence of ABT-888. This
binding was abrogated upon doxo treatment. Doxo/ABT888 cotreatment counteracted PARP-1 removal from
the SNAI1 promoter/enhancer regions. To confirm the
specificity of our ChIP assays, we carried out a positive
control consisting in the amplification of a region
on ITPR1 promoter, positively regulated by PARP-1
(Supplementary Figure 2) [63]. Thus, PARP-1 is not
present on the promoter/enhancer regions when Snail is
upregulated upon doxo treatment while it reappears on
those regions when Snail induction is lowered by the
doxo/ABT-888 cotreatment.
ChIP assays were performed in order to characterize
the histone modification profile at the SNAI1 promoter and
its response to treatments. Figure 3D shows that H3K27
trimethylation (H3K27me3), found in facultatively
repressed genes, was not present in any of the analyzed
conditions. Conversely, acetylated H3 (H3Ac) and H3K4
trimethylation (H3K4me3), which are associated to
actively transcribed promoters, occupied the promoter
indicating its “on” state. H3K4me3 increased significantly

inhibits its expression [21]. We asked whether the doxoinduced upregulation of Snail was able to repress PTEN
expression in MDA-MB-231 cells and whether ABT-888
treatment or PARP-1 depletion, by antagonizing Snail
upregulation, could play a role in modulating PTEN
expression. Real-Time PCR analysis (Figure 4A) showed
a drastic decrease in PTEN expression in cells exposed to
doxo that was significantly counteracted by cotreatment
with ABT-888. The PTEN mRNA levels following doxo
and doxo/ABT-888 treatment resulted inversely correlated
to the Snail level which is in agreement with the reported
function of Snail on PTEN repression.
PTEN is a phosphatase, which provokes Akt
dephosporylation and its inhibition [64]. Therefore
PTEN suppression should cause Akt activation. Western

phosphorylation, in accordance with the reduction of PTEN
which was confirmed at protein level too. Conversely,
the cotreatment with doxo/ABT-888, which allowed the
recovery of PTEN at mRNA and protein level, induced a
decrease in Akt activation thus favouring apoptosis.
In line with the result of the combined treatment,
we showed that the depletion of PARP-1 caused a

positive cells after treatment with doxo at 24–48 h was
observed in Snail-depleted cells with respect to control cells
(around 3 fold) (Figure 5B). These data demonstrate that
Snail deficiency is required for efficient apoptosis in doxotreated cells and support the idea that PARP-1 inhibition/
depletion sensitizes MDA-MB-231 cells by limiting Snail
upregulation. Interestingly, Real-Time PCR analysis
(Figure 5C) showed that, upon doxo treatment, the clear
PTEN downregulation of control cells was not detectable
in Snail-depleted cells. This result is in agreement with the

presence of high Snail levels and their repressive function on
PTEN expression in control cells exposed to doxo.

DISCUSSION
Recent studies have evidenced that PARP inhibitors
may chemosensitize TNBC cell lines [53–55]. Also known
is that Snail can regulate cancer cell survival [14, 15] and
that PARP-1 may be involved in its regulation [24, 27].

Here we aim to investigate the possible cross-talk
between PARP-1 and Snail in MDA-MB-231 cells, a
model of Snail-expressing TNBC cell line, in response to
the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin.
First, we showed that the PARP inhibitor ABT-888
or PARP-1 depletion increases the sensitivity to doxo.
Consistently, the combined doxo/ABT-888 treatment
caused a concomitant increase in γH2AX formation
associated to a significant reduction in clonogenic ability.
Then we investigated whether this chemosensitizing effect
was linked to the control of Snail expression exerted by
PARP-1. Our results demonstrate that both ABT-888
treatment and PARP-1 depletion were able to counteract
the strong upregulation of Snail observed upon treatment
with doxo. Thus, PARP-1 seems to play a positive role
in the regulation of Snail expression, thereby favoring
the survival of cancer cells. One attractive hypothesis is
that activation of PARP-1 may grant the low cytotoxicity
of MDA-MB-231 cells by promoting not only the DNA
repair process but also Snail induction. Conversely, the
decrease of PARP-1 activity may allow efficient apoptosis
by blocking DNA repair and reducing Snail level.
Interestingly, Snail is still upregulated upon combined
treatment, indicating that Snail expression did not depend
only on PARP-1. Other pathways may control Snail level
in DNA damage response [65, 66] or route it in different
processes from cell survival such as the EMT [26].
Results on the different cell lines led to the
important conclusion that PARP activity always provides
a contribution in Snail expression, albeit variable in
dependence of the cell line [59]. In fact, we observed a
trend of Snail level to rise after doxo and to fall after doxo/
ABT-888 treatment both in the TNBC cell lines and in
MCF-7 cells. Our preliminary results (data not shown) and
recent literature [67, 68] indicate that Snail functions are
not necessarily related to cell survival in p53-proficient
MCF-7 cells. In fact, in MCF-7 cells Snail is implicated
in regulating various targets of the EMT process unlike
the p53-mutated TNBC cell lines where Snail acts as
an anti- apoptotic factor [15, 17]. Thus in MCF-7 cells,
PARP-1 might participate to the EMT process through
Snail modulation.
Further, the silencing of PARP-1 in MDA-MB-231
cells has demonstrated that PARP-1 was crucial for the
induction of the SNAI1 promoter transcriptional activity.
More information was obtained by ChIP assays, which
investigated the binding of PARP-1 to specific regions
at the SNAI1 locus. In untreated or ABT-888-treated
cells, PARP-1 occupied the SNAI1 promoter/enhancer
regions and its presence was correlated to Snail basal
transcription. This suggests that PARP-1, independently
of its activity [69], may act as gene-specific coregulator
providing features of permissive/active chromatin. On the
contrary, PARP-1 no longer occupied the SNAI1 promoter
and enhancer regions upon doxo treatment, indicating
that PARP-1 activation and its displacement from DNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are important events in the induction mechanism of Snail
expression. Consistently, PARP inhibition reestablished
PARP-1 occupancy of the DNA loci after combined
doxo/ABT-888 treatment, giving rise to a lower Snail
upregulation.
ChIP analyses for chromatin marks showed that
H3K27me3 was not present on SNAI1 promoter in
any of the analyzed conditions while active histone
modifications (H3Ac and H3K4me3) were well
represented, indicating the “on” state of the promoter.
We speculate that PARP-1 allows the recruitment
of positive modifiers such as histone acetylases and
histone methyltransferases in absence of any damaging
stimulus. The importance of the basal activity of PARP1 in H3 acetylation is supported by H3Ac depletion
arisen from exposure to ABT-888 either in presence
or absence of doxo. As the gene was induced by doxo
treatment, H3K4me3 increased significantly, suggesting
the possibility that newly synthesized PARs on PARP-1
may block the access of some negative effector to the
promoter, such as the lysine demethylase 5B (KDM5B)
which is therefore kept far from the promoter [63].
Further experiments were carried out to individuate
pro-apoptotic targets of Snail affected by PARP inhibition/
depletion. We focused our attention on different targets
from p53, since in MDA-MB-231 cells, p53 results to be
highly expressed and its function impaired. According to
recent papers [21, 70], Snail can activate Akt by repressing
the PI3K negative regulator PTEN, a direct Snail target.
Our Real-Time PCR results show that in cells exposed to
doxo the strong PTEN downregulation was counteracted
by cotreatment with ABT-888 or by depletion of PARP-1.
This result suggests the intervention of Snail on PTEN
expression, since high levels of Snail elicited by doxo
cause PTEN downregulation whereas lower Snail levels
are in accordance with a lower suppressive effect on
PTEN expression. As expected, PTEN suppression was
associated to an increase of Akt phosphorylation in doxo
treated cells. Conversely, the milder PTEN downregulation
was correlated to a reduction of Akt phosphorylation in
doxo treated cells either exposed to ABT-888 or depleted
of PARP-1. Therefore, we suggest that PARP-1, by
regulating at transcriptional level the expression of the
oncoprotein Snail, controls Akt phosphorylation through
targeting PTEN expression.
Since we have shown that Snail contributes to activate
survival pathways, its reduction, by offsetting these pathways,
should result in higher cytotoxicity to the doxo treatment.
Effectively, Snail deficiency of MDA-MB-231 cells
showed an increased sensitivity to doxo-induced apoptosis.
Moreover, Snail deficiency opposed to PTEN suppression
elicited by doxo treatment, supporting the inhibitory role of
Snail on PTEN expression. This result recalls the enhanced
apoptosis obtained following PARP inhibition/depletion and
suggests that the downregulation of Snail level may represent
the crucial event to reach apoptosis.

Analysis of apoptosis by Annexin V staining

In conclusion, PARP-1 works as a kind of switch
modulating Snail expression and hence the response
to doxo treatment, as depicted in the model shown in
Figure 6. The low apoptotic rate observed in MDAMB-231 cells exposed to doxo is correlated to the high
expression levels of Snail oncoprotein. PARP-1 activation,
which coincides with its displacement from SNAI1 locus,
is required for Snail induction. The increased apoptotic
rate is related to a lower upregulation of Snail. PARP1 seats on the promoter and controls, through its basal
activity, Snail transcription.
Moreover, we showed that the lower upregulation of
Snail is a fundamental event to the occurrence of apoptosis
because it causes the recovery of PTEN expression.
Further studies are required to clarify this molecular
mechanism in detail.
In summary, the data of this study indicate that the
lowering of Snail levels in cancer cells may represent a
new crucial mechanism by which PARP inhibitors act
sensitizing to chemotherapeutic drugs. In considering the
mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors, it is important
to keep in mind not only their function on DNA damage
[71], but also on the regulation of cancer-related genes
expression. We believe that more knowledge on the
effect of PARP inhibitors in specific cell lines will allow
to improve the outcome of specific subgroups of breast
cancer patients.

Induction of apoptosis was assessed by measuring
Annexin V binding to externalized phosphatidylserine,
as previously described [72]. Briefly, cells were washed
twice with PBS and resuspended in binding buffer 10
mM Hepes/NaOH pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM
CaCl2 (Sigma Chemical Co.). FITC conjugated Annexin
V (Roche Diagnostic Corp.) was added at a final
concentration of 1 μg/ml. The mixture was incubated at
room temperature for 15 min in the dark. Stained cells
were analyzed by flow cytometry using a Accuri C6 flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson), while simultaneously
assessing membrane integrity by propidium iodide (PI)
(0.25 μg/ml) exclusion. Samples were analyzed using the
CFlow Plus software.

Western blot analysis
Total cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 1 mM EDTA)
added with sodium orthovanadate 3 mM, NaF 100 mM
supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich).
Lysates were kept on ice for 25 min and then centrifuged
at 16000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatants were collected
and quantified by Bradford protein assay reagent (Biorad).
25 μg of proteins were loaded and separated by SDSPAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane
(HybondTM ECLTM GE Healthcare). Immunoblots probed
with the specific antibodies were developed using ECL
or ECL Plus chemiluminescence reaction. The following
antibodies were used: Snail (L70G2) (Cell Signaling),
PARP-1 (clone C2–10 able to detect the 89kDa cleaved
fragment of PARP-1; Enzo Life Sciences), PARP-1 (clone
F1–23; Enzo Life Sciences), PAR (clone 10HA; Trevigen),
Actin (Sigma-Aldrich), Akt (Cell Signaling), PhosphoAkt (Ser473) (Cell Signaling), PTEN (Cell Signaling),
Phospho-Histone H2AX (Ser139) (Millipore).

Colony forming assay
To evaluate cell colony-forming ability,
exponentially growing MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
with doxo 0.5 μM or ABT-888 0.5 μM alone or in
combination for 2 hours. At the end of treatment, aliquots
of cell suspension from each sample were seeded into
60-mm Petri dishes with complete medium and incubated
for three weeks. Colonies were stained with 2% methylene
blue in 95% ethanol and counted. Percentage of colonies
arising from surviving treated cells was calculated relative
to colonies arising from untreated control cells.

FIGURE 6: Model of Snail transcriptional regulation by PARP-1 and effect of the differential Snail expression on
apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. The presence or absence of PARP-1 on the SNAI1 promoter/enhancer, which depends on the rate

of PARP activity, affects the activity of SNAI1 promoter (see Discussion). After the doxorubicin treatment (left side), PARP activity
increases and PARP-1 detaches from DNA probably bringing away repressive factors (gray circle) from the promoter while other positive
transcription factors (blue circles) may bind it. This event causes a strong increase in Snail transcription (green circles) and the consequent
repression of its target gene PTEN which results in resistance to apoptosis. After the treatment with doxo/ABT-888 (right side), PARP
activity decreases and PARP-1 can bind the SNAI1 promoter/enhancer possibly causing the release of positive transcription factors from the
promoter (light blue circles). The Snail transcription is lower, leading to a less efficacious repression of Snail on PTEN transcription and to
a significant recovery of the apoptotic process.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

antisense was 5′-GTGCCACTGGTCTATAATCCA-3′.
Gene expression analysis was performed using the
comparative cycle threshold method with GAPDH for
normalization. The sense oligonucleotide for GAPDH
was 5′-CCAGTGACGTTCCCGTTCAGC-3′ and the
antisense was 5′-CCCATCACCATCTCCCAGGAG-3′.

ChIP assays were performed as previously described
[73]. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were:
normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz), polyclonal antibody
for PARP-1 (Enzo Lifescience), H3Ac (Millipore),
H3K4me3 (Millipore) and H3K27me3 (Millipore). The
sense oligonucleotide used to amplify the promoter
region
was
5′-AACCCCGCCTCGGAGGAGT-3′
and
the
antisense
oligonucleotide
was
5′-CCAATCGGAGGCTCGTCT-3′. Real-Time PCR
assays were carried out to amplify the enhancer region
as already described [62]. The sense oligonucleotide
used was FW 5′-GAGCAGCCCTTAATGACTTG-3′
and
the
antisense
oligonucleotide
was
5′-CCCAACTCCCTAACTTCCC-3′.
The
sense
oligonucleotide used to amplify the promoter region
of ITPR1 was 5′-ACTGAGGTCGCGGTTTGTAT-3′
