BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate the outcomes of patients with locally advanced breast cancer
(LABC) who were treated with a multidisciplinary approach including primary systemic chemotherapy and noncross-resistant adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients with LABC received 4 or 6 cycles of doxorubicin and docetaxel (DT) as
primary systemic chemotherapy (PST) every 21 days. Patients with adequate response underwent surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy according to pathologic response: complete (pCR), 2 more cycles of DT; partial (pPR), 2 more cycles
of DT followed by 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (CMF); and minor (pMR), 6 cycles
of CMF. Patients then received radiation and tamoxifen (hormone receptor-positive patients only). RESULTS: Eighty-eight
patients were evaluable. Seventy-four patients had an adequate response to DT and were considered operable, and 72
underwent surgery. Ten patients (13.9%) achieved a pCR, 22 (30.5%) achieved a pPR, and 40 achieved a pMR (55.5%). Fourteen patients were considered nonoperable after DTand underwent salvage CMF therapy. Five of these patients underwent
surgery and 1 had achieved a pCR. The estimated 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates for patients with pCR, pPR,
and pMR were 80%, 77%, and 59%, respectively, and the estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 90%, 91%, and
74%, respectively. The 5-year OS rates were 82% for initially operable and 21% for initially inoperable patients (P  .001)
CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary therapy that includes PST with DT and adjuvant therapy with CMF administered according to the clinical and pathologic response is associated with high long-term RFS and OS rates in patients with LABC. Clinical or pathologic PR or CR to DT predicts improved RFS and OS. Cancer 2010;116:1210–7. Published 2010 by the American

Doxorubicin and Docetaxel for Breast Cancer/Alvarez et al

Although locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is
uncommon (approximately 5-10%) in the United States
and Western Europe, it represents the most common presentation (between 30% and 50%) in many developing
countries.1 Currently, the standard initial therapy for
LABC, including inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), is
primary systemic therapy (PST). The aims of PST are to
reduce the risk of disease recurrence by treating potential
areas of distant microscopic metastatic disease, to reduce
breast and lymph node tumor burden, to improve surgical
respectability, and provide early information or surrogate
markers for long-term outcome.2 The response to PST
and, in particular, the achievement of a pathologic complete response (pCR) has been established in prospective
clinical trials as an early predictor of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).2-5
In the 1990s, many investigators attempted to
improve the pCR rate after PST by adding taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) to anthracyclines. Docetaxel given
concomitantly or sequentially with doxorubicin as PST
has been shown to have meaningful efficacy,6 and in 1
large trial (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Project [NSABP] B-27), docetaxel administered in
sequence after a doxorubicin-containing regimen resulted
in improved pCR rates.7
Due to the activity of the anthracyclines and
taxanes as well as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (CMF) in metastatic breast
cancer, in 1997 we designed a trial to determine
whether adding the noncross-resistant CMF regimen
as adjuvant (postoperative) therapy improves pCR, as
well as RFS and OS in patients who achieve less than
a pCR after PST with doxorubicin and docetaxel
(DT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
This trial was conducted at The University of Texas M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center after Institutional Review
Board approval (Protocol ID97-099). All patients provided written informed consent. Patients were enrolled
between January 1998 and June 2000. Eligible patients
had newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven LABC (stage IIB and
stage IIIA, B, and C) according to the sixth edition of the
American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging System.8
Inclusion criteria were as follows: Karnofsky performance
status 70% and normal cardiac function (left ventricular
ejection fraction >50%), bone marrow function (absolute

neutrophil count 1500/lL, platelet count >100,000/
lL), liver function (bilirubin level 1.5 times the upper
limit of normal), renal function (creatinine level <2.0
mg/dL), and neurologic function (peripheral neuropathy
< grade 2). Exclusion criteria were history of unstable cardiac disorder (eg, unstable angina or recent myocardial infarction), congestive heart failure, or a left ventricular
ejection fraction detected by cardiac blood pool scan or
echocardiogram of 50%. The study was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Clinical Response Assessment After PST
With DT
The trial design is outlined in Figure 1. Patients received 2
cycles of PST with DT and were then re-evaluated by a
multidisciplinary team, including a medical oncologist,
radiation oncologist, breast surgeon, and breast radiologist. Evaluation was comprised of physical examination,

1211

Original Article

breast ultrasound, and mammography. After this, if
patients achieved a clinical CR or a clinical partial
response (PR) (>50% reduction in the product of the 2
longest perpendicular tumor dimensions), 2 additional
cycles of DT were administered preoperatively; if insufficient response was observed, the patients were crossed
over to CMF. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as a
>50% increase in size in the bidimensional tumor
dimensions.
Pathologic Response Assessment
After Surgery
The pCR was defined as no residual invasive tumor
(breast and axillary lymph nodes). Pathologic PR (pPR)
was defined as a >50% reduction in the product of the 2
longest perpendicular tumor dimensions and 3 positive
lymph nodes. Pathologic minor response (pMR) was
defined as a <50% reduction in the primary breast tumor
and/or 4 positive lymph nodes.‘
DT and CMF Regimens
The DT regimen was comprised of doxorubicin at a dose
of 60 mg/m2 intravenously (iv) on Day 1 followed by
docetaxel at a dose of 60 mg/m2 iv on Day 1. Cycles were
administered every 21 days. All patients received prophylactic granulocyte-macrophage—colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) at a dose of 250 lg/m2/day subcutaneously. GM-CSF was initiated on Day 3 of therapy and
was given for 5 days (Days 3-7) or until the absolute neutrophil count was >2000/lL.
The CMF regimen was comprised of cyclophosphamide at a dose of 600 mg/m2 iv, methotrexate at a dose of
40 mg/m2 iv, and 5-FU at a dose of 600 mg/m2 iv; all
drugs were administered on Days 1 and 8. Cycles were
administered every 21 days. Patients who had grade 3 to
4 toxicities (according to National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria [NCI CTC]) on Day 21, neutropenic fever, or documented infection received prophylactic GM-CSF during subsequent cycles. GM-CSF was
administered at a dose of 250 lg/m2/day subcutaneously
from Day 9 of therapy until Day 13 or until the absolute
neutrophil count was >2000/lL, whichever occurred
later.
Surgery
After 4 cycles of DT, patients with a clinical response were
considered candidates for surgery and assessed at a Multidisciplinary Breast Cancer Planning Clinic. Patients
whose disease met the following criteria underwent seg-

1212

mental mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection:
1) single breast mass measuring 4 cm in largest dimension (or 2 primary tumors in the same quadrant of the
breast); 2) no residual involvement of skin or chest wall;
3) tumor/breast size ratio small enough for a good cosmetic result; 4) no evidence of matted or fixed axillary
lymph nodes (by physical examination, mammography,
and ultrasound); and 5) patient desiring a breast conservative approach. Patients whose disease did not fulfill these
criteria underwent modified radical mastectomy.
Adjuvant Chemotherapy
In patients who underwent surgery, different types of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered depending on
the magnitude of the pathologic response (Fig. 1). The
regimens were as described as above. Trastuzumab was
not used in this clinical trial.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy was given within 6 weeks after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were treated with
50.4 grays (Gy) (1.8 Gy per fraction; 28 fractions) or 50
Gy (2 Gy per fraction; 25 fractions) to the chest wall (after
modified radical mastectomy) or breast (after breast-conserving surgery [BCS]); supraclavicular region, and internal mammary lymph nodes. The midaxilla was treated
with a dose of 40 to 50 Gy if the pathologic findings
included any 1 of the following: a lymph node measuring
2.5 cm, fixed or matted lymph nodes, undissected axilla,
or pathologic evidence of extracapsular extension >2 mm.
A boost of 10 Gy (2 Gy per fraction; 5 fractions) was
administered to the chest wall (after mastectomy) or the
location of the primary breast tumor (demarcated by surgical clips) after delivery of 50.4 or 50 Gy to the chest wall
or breast. Patients with IBC were treated with accelerated,
hyperfractionated irradiation.
Tamoxifen
Patients with estrogen receptor (ER) -positive tumors or
unknown ER status received tamoxifen at a dose of 20
mg/day by mouth, beginning at the conclusion of all systemic chemotherapy and continuing for 5 years or until
disease recurrence.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoints were the clinical objective
response rate and pathologic response after PST with DT.
Secondary endpoints included RFS and OS. Two earlier
protocols that investigated treatment of LABC patients in

Cancer

our institution with multidisciplinary management (DM
85-01 and DM 89-007) reported objective response rates
of 70% to 85%, respectively.9,10 Two hypotheses were
evaluated using the method recommended by Simon11:
P1 with an overall response rate (ORR) <0.70 (ie, a rate at
this level or below would not be of interest for further
study), and P2: ORR >0.85 (ie, a rate at this level or above
would be of considerable interest). An interim analysis
was planned after treatment of the first 20 patients. If
<14 patients (70%) had achieved objective response, the
trial would be terminated; otherwise, accrual would continue to 88 patients. RFS was measured from the date of
first treatment to the date of disease recurrence or last follow-up visit. OS was calculated from the date of diagnosis
to death. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was
used to compute freedom from distant metastasis. The
log-rank test was also used to compare the survival estimates in the 2 groups. P values < .05 were considered
statistically significant.

RESULTS
From January 1998 through June 2000, 88 female
patients were enrolled in this phase 2 study. All 88
patients completed the initial 2 cycles of DT. A total of 74
patients (84%) had an adequate response to 4 or 6 cycles
of PST with DT, and were considered candidates for surgery; 72 patients actually underwent surgery. Patient and
tumor characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Four
patients had IBC. The median Karnofsky performance
status score was 90.
Clinical Response After PST With DT
On clinical assessment after 4 to 6 cycles of DT, 3 patients
(3.4%) achieved a clinical CR, 76 patients (86.4%) a clinical PR, 4 patients (4.5%) a clinical MR, and 5 patients
(5.7%) had clinical PD. Overall clinical response rate was
89.8%.
Surgery and Pathologic Response
Of the 74 patients who were considered candidates for
surgery after PST with DT, 2 did not actually undergo
surgery and were treated with radiotherapy. One patient
with baseline T0N2M1 achieved a clinical PR from DT
and received radiotherapy only; at the time of last follow–
up, the patient remained with no evidence of disease
(NED). Another patient with a clinical PR after DT with
extensive supraclavicular and infraclavicular lymph node
involvement received radiation only and was considered

to have NED at the time of last follow–up. Thirteen
(18%) patients underwent BCS and 59 (82%) patients
underwent modified radical mastectomy. On pathologic
evaluation, 10 patients (13.9%) had a pCR, 22 patients
(30.5%) had a pPR, and 40 patients (55.5%) had a pMR.
Fourteen patients (19%) had negative axillary lymph
nodes, 19 patients (26%) had 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes,
23 patients (32%) had 4 to 9 positive lymph nodes, and
15 patients (21%) had  10 positive lymph nodes. One
pathologic sample (1.3%) was not available for analysis.
Outcomes in Patients Treated With
Salvage CMF
Overall, 14 patients (16%) were crossed over to CMF salvage regimen without surgery because of a suboptimal

Original Article

response to PST with DT. Six of these 14 patients
achieved a PR but remained inoperable, 3 patients had
SD, and 5 patients had PD. After salvage therapy with
CMF, 5 patients became surgical candidates (36%). One
patient achieved a pCR and was alive with NED at the
time of last follow–up. This patient had IBC and had
achieved a clinical PR but had residual edema after CMF.
One patient became operable, 1 underwent high-dose
chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation, 3
received preoperative radiotherapy, and 1 had PD. Five
patients were crossed over to salvage CMF after 4 cycles of
DT. Two became operable, and 3 received radiotherapy.
Three patients had an inadequate response after 4
cycles of DT, and had the regimen extended to 6 cycles
and then were crossed over to salvage CMF. Two of these
patients became operable; 1 patient received radiotherapy
only.
Adjuvant Chemotherapy
Among the 72 patients who underwent surgery after PST
with DT, adjuvant treatment was as follows: DT only in 9
patients (10%), DT followed by CMF in 21 patients
(29%), CMF only in 41 patients (57%), and paclitaxel in
1 patient (1.4%).
Radiotherapy
Eighty-six patients (98%) received radiotherapy; 2
patients did not receive radiotherapy because they were
found to have metastatic disease. Seventy-four patients
received adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery. Seven
patients received preoperative radiotherapy after an inadequate response to salvage CMF and 5 of these patients
became surgical candidates after irradiation. Two patients
were treated with definitive radiotherapy without surgery:
1 patient with baseline T0N3 disease achieved a PR after
DT and received radiotherapy only; the second patient
had extensive supraclavicular and infraclavicular lymph
node involvement, achieved a PR after DT, and also
received radiotherapy. Both patients remained withNED
at the time of last follow–up.
Hormonal Therapy
Thirty-five patients were treated with tamoxifen at a dose
of 20 mg daily  5 years after adjuvant chemotherapy.
Safety Profile
All patients were evaluable for toxicity. For PST with DT,
the median number of cycles was 4.3 cycles. Rates of grade
3 and 4 hematologic side effects according to the NCI

1214

CTC were as follows: leukopenia, 37.5% and 44%; neutropenia, 12.5% and 81%; thrombocytopenia, 3.4% and
2.2%; and anemia, 10.2% and 2.2%, respectively.
For CMF, the median number of cycles was 5.6
cycles (either salvage or adjuvant); rates of grade 3 and 4
side effects were as follows: leukopenia, 30.6% and
11.3%; neutropenia, 27.2% and 19.3%; thrombocytopenia, 5.6% and 5.6%; and anemia, 2.2% and 6.8%,
respectively.
Twelve patients (13.6%) had documented grade 3
infection and 1 (1.1%) had a grade 4 infection. Twentyseven events of neutropenic fever (30.6% of patients) were
documented. Grade 3 fatigue and grade 3 paresthesias
occurred in 52.2% and 1.1% of patients, respectively.
One patient who received 6 cycles of DT followed by 4
cycles of adjuvant CMF developed congestive heart failure
with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 29% and died of
brain metastasis. No secondary malignancies, such as
acute myelogenous leukemia, were observed.
Survival
At a median follow-up of 107 months (range, 18-133
months), 48 patients (54%) were alive and free of breast
cancer, 6 patients (7%) were alive with breast cancer, 2
patients had died without evidence of disease (1 of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and 1 of with multiple
comorbidities), and 32 patients (36%) had died of breast
cancer. Survival analysis according to the response category demonstrated the following: pCR (10 patients
treated with PST with DT) in 10 patients (13.8%), pPR
in 22 patients (30.5%), and pMR in 40 patients (55.5%).
The 5-year estimated RFS rates for patients with pCR,
pPR, and pMR were 80%, 77%, and 59%, respectively (P
¼ .078) (Fig. 2 Top). The 5-year estimated OS rates for
patients with pCR, pPR, and pMR were 90%, 91%, and
74%, respectively (P ¼ .022) (Fig. 2 Bottom). The 5-year
estimated RFS rate for responders to PST with DT was
68% and was 14% for nonresponders (P <0.001) (Fig. 3
Top). The estimated 5-year OS rate was better for the 74
responders to PST with DT than for the 14 nonresponders (82% vs 21%; P <.001) (Fig. 3 Bottom).

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study demonstrate that patients
with LABC who responded to PST with the combination of an anthracycline and a taxane, and had multidisciplinary management including surgery, radiotherapy, and

adjuvant chemotherapy (DT or noncross-resistant regimen CMF), achieved an excellent RFS and OS.
PST has become the standard of care for patients
with LABC and large operable stage II breast cancer. The
study published by Thomas et al12 from our institution
used early clinical response as a decision aid. A total of
193 evaluable patients with LABC (of whom 80% had
stage III disease) received PST comprised of 3 cycles of
vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (VACP). After surgery, patients were stratified on
the basis of pathologic response. Patients with <1 cm3 of
residual tumor present at mastectomy received an addi-

tional 5 cycles of VACP. Patients with >1 cm3 of residual
tumor present were randomly assigned to an additional 5
cycles of VACP or 5 cycles of vinblastine, methotrexate,
leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (VbMF). Patients who
achieved a clinical CR or pCR after VACP had improved
survival compared with patients with less response. The
absolute improvements in 5-year RFS and OS rates with
the use of VbMF in addition to VACP were 10% and
18%, respectively.
The current trial was designed to evaluate early
response to 2 initial cycles of DT in a group of patients
with inoperable LABC, including IBC. Evaluation of tumor response was performed by clinical examination by a
multidisciplinary team and imaging. In designing this
study, we took into consideration that patients could
require longer administration of chemotherapy before
surgery; therefore, patients were allowed receive 4 or 6

1215

Original Article

cycles of PST with DT. Our results were very promising
because, despite all patients being initially inoperable at
baseline, 74 patients (84%) became surgical candidates.
Several trials have tested a similar hypothesis on the
basis of clinical rather than pathologic response. In the
Aberdeen trial,13 162 patients were enrolled and treated
with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and
prednisone (CVAP). Responders (66.1%) were randomly
assigned to 4 additional cycles of CVAP or docetaxel;
nonresponders (34.1%) received docetaxel. The combination of CVAP and docetaxel was found to be superior to
that of CVAP and additional cycles of CVAP, and complete eradication of invasive tumor cells was achieved in
30.8% of the CVAP-docetaxel group and 15.4% of the
CVAP-CVAP group. Patients with an initial response to
CVAP who crossed over to docetaxel were found to have a
significantly higher survival rate at 5 years (90% vs 70%).
Conversely, patients in whom CVAP failed did not have
significant benefit after the crossover to docetaxel.
The German GeparTrio study14 tested the role of
using a noncross-resistant regimen in nonresponders. In
that study, patients with operable breast cancer were evaluated after 2 cycles of PST with docetaxel, doxorubicin,
and cyclophosphamide every 21 days (TAC). Patients
with chemosensitive disease (decrease in tumor size
50% as defined by clinical examination and breast ultrasonography) were randomized to receive 4 or 6 additional
cycles of TAC. Patients with chemoinsensitive tumors
were randomly assigned to 4 cycles of a noncross-resistant
chemotherapy regimen, vinorelbine and capecitabine, versus 4 additional cycles of TAC. For the early responding
patients, the primary objective of the study was to compare the rate of pCR after 6 cycles of TAC with that after
8 cycles of TAC. There was no statistically significantly
difference noted with regard to the pCR rates between the
groups (21.0% vs 23.5% [difference of 2.5%]; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-6.8% [P ¼ .27]). Approximately one–
third of the patients did not respond to the initial 2 cycles
of TAC. They were randomly assigned to an additional 4
cycles of TAC or 4 cycles of vinorelbine and capecitabine
(NX).15 There were no significant differences noted
between the TAC and NX regimens with respect to the
pCR rate (5.3% and 6.0%, respectively).
Other clinical trials have shown that patients who
do not respond to the initial cycles of PST have an unfavorable prognosis.7,16
In the current study, we described 14 patients who
were considered inoperable after PST with DT; after
crossover to CMF, 5 of these patients (36%) became oper-

1216

able, and 1 of them (7.4%), who achieved a PR after DT,
achieved a pCR.
Data from others noncross-resistant regimens
used in clinical trials as part of adjuvant treatment
revealed an improvement in the RFS and OS rates of
approximately 10% and 20%, respectively.12,13 The
CMF regimen was chosen as a part of the adjuvant
program because its popularity in the adjuvant setting
and low toxicity. These results are similar to those
from GeparTrio.16 Furthermore, the results of the current study indicate that crossover to CMF could be
considered for patients with LABC who achieve only a
MR or PR after anthracycline-based and taxane-based
PST. This is particularly relevant for developing countries, in which this alternative noncross-resistant regimen (CMF) is widely available. Another therapeutic
option for this situation is the use of capecitabine and,
more recently, ixabepilone.
In conclusion, the results of the current study provide mature data demonstrating excellent OS and RFS for
patients with initially inoperable LABC who responded to
PST with a combination of an anthracycline and a taxane.
Adjuvant CMF in patients who initially achieved a PR,
indicating partial sensitivity to chemotherapy, may add to
the initial benefit from PST with DT. For patients with
residual disease after surgery, the prognosis is ominous;
newer, potentially more effective therapies, including
other chemotherapies and targeted therapies, should be
studied to improve response and ultimately survival in
women with LABC.
