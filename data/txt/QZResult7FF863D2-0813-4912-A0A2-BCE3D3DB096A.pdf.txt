BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis data demonstrate a 5% absolute survival benefit for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using cisplatinbased combination regimens in the radical treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). However, there are no randomized,
controlled trial data on the optimum regimen. Accelerated methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (AMVAC) is a doseintense regimen that has the potential to minimize delays to definitive, potentially curative therapy. A retrospective analysis is presented of the efficacy and toxicity of AMVAC as NAC in patients with MIBC and its impact on the patient pathway. METHODS: Eighty
consecutive patients with MIBC were treated with AMVAC as NAC by 2 UK multidisciplinary uro-oncology teams. Three or 4 cycles of
AMVAC (methotrexate 30 mg/m2, vinblastine 3 mg/m2, doxorubicin 30 mg/m2, and cisplatin 70 mg/m2) were given at 2-week intervals, with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support, prior to either radical surgery or radical radiotherapy. RESULTS: All planned
cycles of chemotherapy were completed, without dose reduction or delay in 84% of patients. All 80 patients subsequently received
their planned definitive therapy. Grade 3/4 toxicities were seen in 26% of the 42% of patients for whom toxicity data are available,
including 12% grade 3/4 neutropenia. Pathological complete response to AMVAC was seen in 43% of 60 surgical patients. Objective
radiological local response was seen in 83% of 57 evaluable patients. Two-year disease-free and overall survival were 65% and 77%,
respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AMVAC is safe and appears to be a well-tolerated and effective NAC regimen for MIBC. It minimizes
delays to definitive treatment and produces excellent pathological and radiological response rates. It is an appropriate comparator

INTRODUCTION
Bladder cancer is the most frequently occurring tumor of the urinary tract and accounts for approximately 70,000 new
cancer cases and 14,000 deaths in the United States each year.1,2 Approximately 25% of patients present with life-threatening muscle-invasive (pT2-4a) transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder.3 Radical cystectomy with lymphadenectomy is the curative standard of care worldwide and leads to approximately 50% disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years.4-6
Radical radiotherapy is widely used as an alternative potentially curative approach for patients with significant comorbidity, and offers the prospect of long-term organ preservation with better preservation of sexual function.7
Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) have each been investigated as a means of reducing the occurrence of
effectively incurable distant metastases.8 Meta-analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy data has shown a trend toward benefit, but
not reaching statistical significance,9 whereas individualized patient data for NAC with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy are more robust, with an absolute overall survival (OS) benefit of 5% (from 45%-50%) at 5 years.10,11 NAC has

therefore come to be regarded by many as standard of care
for appropriately selected patients undergoing curative treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)12,13 but is
not universally offered to patients. Among the reasons for
NAC not being offered to all patients is concern regarding
the delay which chemotherapy introduces to radical treatment. As a minor contributor to cure, relative to surgery or
radiotherapy, prolonged administration of NAC and/or recovery from toxicity may introduce delays to definitive therapy, with a potential adverse effect on outcome.14-16
Two widely used neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy regimens are methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin
(Adriamycin), and cisplatin (MVAC)17 and gemcitabine
and cisplatin (GC).18 ‘‘Accelerated’’ MVAC (AMVAC) is a
more dose-intense form of ‘‘classical’’ MVAC, which
employs the same doses of drugs but is given at shorter, 2week intervals with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(GCSF) support. GC and AMVAC have each been compared with classical MVAC (but not with each other) in
randomized, controlled trials for patients with advanced
urothelial cancer.19,20 Both regimens result in similar efficacy, but less toxicity compared to MVAC.
As a dose-intense regimen, AMVAC offers the opportunity to minimize the delay to definitive treatment imposed
by more protracted regimens such as GC and MVAC, but
there is a lack of data regarding its use in the neoadjuvant setting. We therefore report our experience of AMVAC prior to
radical cystectomy or radiotherapy in 80 patients treated at 2
UK cancer centers by specialist multidisciplinary teams.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We performed a retrospective analysis of patient records for all
80 consecutive patients who received AMVAC chemotherapy
in 2 treatment centers in the United Kingdom, at Oxford (44
patients, 55%) and Leeds (36 patients, 45%), between July
2003 and September 2007. Patients were treated in an identical fashion at the 2 centers, except that patients at Leeds
received 4 cycles of chemotherapy, whereas patients at Oxford
received 3, according to routine local practice. All patients had
histologically proven TCC of the bladder with pathological
and radiological evidence of T2-4a, N0-2, M0 disease.
Patients with no radiological evidence of pelvic (N0) or abdominal nodal involvement received AMVAC as NAC prior
to planned radical surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent;
those staged as (N1-2) received the same regimen as primary
chemotherapy in an attempt to down-stage disease, prior to
possible subsequent radical therapy. All patients had a calculated glomerular filtration rate of 55 mL/minute or greater.
The AMVAC chemotherapy regimen consists of
methotrexate 30 mg/m2, vinblastine 3 mg/m2, doxorubiCancer

August 15, 2012

cin 30 mg/m2, and 4-hour infusion of cisplatin 70 mg/m2,
together with hydration before and after administration.
Treatment was repeated every 2 weeks, for 3 or 4 cycles,
depending on the treating center, as above. Patients were
given prophylactic GCSF for 7 days, starting 24 hours after
the last dose of cytotoxic drug. All NAC was delivered in
the 2 centers.
Staging computed tomography scans were performed within 4 weeks prior to commencing chemotherapy and, in the majority of cases, again within 4 weeks of
completion of chemotherapy, prior to definitive treatment. Paired pre- and post-NAC scans were assessed by
expert site-specialist uro-oncology radiologists for
response to NAC. Where disease was confined to the
bladder, scans were not reported to Response Evaluation
Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, because disease manifests almost exclusively as diffuse bladder wall
thickening, rather than as discrete, measurable lesions.
After chemotherapy, patients either underwent radical
cystectomy or radical radiotherapy as definitive therapy,
with curative intent. Patients did not routinely undergo cystoscopic assessment between completion of NAC and definitive treatment. In all cases, at both centers, the definitive
treatment modality (surgery or radiotherapy) was determined prior to commencement of chemotherapy. Definitive treatment was planned for approximately 4 weeks after
the final dose of chemotherapy, with surgeons and radiotherapists usually being advised of recommended start dates
for radical treatment as chemotherapy commenced.
Radical cystectomy routinely included an extended
pelvic lymph node dissection, laterally to the genitofemoral nerve, posteriorly to the obturator nerve, and cranially
to the aortic bifurcation.
Radical cystectomy specimens were each routinely
assessed postoperatively by experienced specialist urological pathologists for evidence of macroscopic and microscopic residual tumor following NAC. Central review was
not performed. Pathology reports were retrospectively
reviewed to calculate the proportion of patients showing a
pathological complete response (pCR or T0) to NAC.
Radical radiotherapy was administered as 55 Gy in
20 fractions (Leeds) or 66 Gy in 33 fractions (Oxford).
Gross target volume was defined as whole bladder plus
any radiologically detectable tumor; clinical target volume
was 0.5 cm around visible tumor (in male patients, the
prostatic urethra was included where the bladder base or
trigone was involved with disease); planning target volume was 1.5 cm around clinical target volume. Patients
treated with radical radiotherapy underwent regular cystoscopic bladder surveillance, to detect in-field local
recurrences.

Kaplan-Meier estimates of disease-free survival
(DFS) and OS were plotted. DFS was defined as time to
recurrence of disease or death.
RESULTS
Eighty patients (64 male, 16 female) with a median age of
60 years were treated with AMVAC as NAC, including
23% aged 70 years or more at the commencement of
chemotherapy (Table 1). Sixty-eight patients (85% of the
total) were radiologically node-negative (rN0) on prechemotherapy staging by cross-sectional imaging. Definitive
local therapy involved radical cystectomy for 60 patients
(75%) and radical radiotherapy for 20 patients (25%).
The median age of patients treated with radiotherapy was significantly greater than in patients treated by
cystectomy (age, 64 years vs 59 years; P ¼ .0015), but
there was a lower male:female ratio (3:1 vs 4:1; not significant). The distribution of performance status was similar
in both groups (PS0:PS1, 63%:37% and 61%:39%,
respectively). In the absence of postchemotherapy histological specimens for patients treated with radical radiotherapy, and with the unavoidable uncertainties of
radiological T staging, it is not possible to compare the
local extent of tumors treated with radical radiotherapy
with those treated by cystectomy. However, the proportion of patients with radiologically node-positive disease
was similar between the 2 patient groups (13% of the 60
surgical patients; 20% of the 20 radiotherapy patients).
3922

Thirty-eight (63%) of the radical cystectomies were
performed at the same 2 centers in which NAC was
delivered; the remaining 22 were performed at 1 of 4 other
sites. Regardless of surgical location, all cystectomies were
performed by specialist urological surgeons with extensive
experience of performing cystectomies. The mean number
of nodes removed was 17. To date, none of the patients
treated with radical radiotherapy have required salvage
cystectomy for muscle-invasive recurrence.
Safety

There were no deaths within 30 days of the most recent
dose of chemotherapy, and only 2 of 60 surgical patients
died within 30 days of surgery (perioperative mortality
rate of 3.3%), neither of which was attributable to
chemotherapy.
Feasibility

Seventy (87%) of the 80 patients completed all planned
cycles (89% at Leeds, 4 cycles; 86% at Oxford, 3 cycles),
without treatment delays or dose reductions. Six patients
(7%) required a dose reduction due to chemotherapyrelated toxicity, and a further 4 (5%) patients did not
complete the planned number of cycles (3 because of toxicity of chemotherapy and 1 because of a revision of the
histological diagnosis to a non-TCC histology). One
patient received a total of 5 cycles of chemotherapy rather
than the planned 3. The additional 2 cycles were felt to
be appropriate to obtain maximal response, following a
radiological response in radiologically positive pelvic
lymph nodes, while awaiting commencement of radical
radiotherapy. All patients who commenced NAC subsequently received their planned definitive treatment.
Duration of Chemotherapy and Time to
Definitive Treatment

The median time from diagnosis to definitive treatment,
including chemotherapy, for all 80 patients, was 137 days
(range, 49-390 days). Eleven patients (18%) experienced significant delays (more than 200 days from diagnosis to definitive treatment). In 2 (2.5%) of these (one due to chest
infection and the other to a transient ischemic attack and
chest infection), it was impossible to exclude the possibility
that delay may have been related to toxicity of chemotherapy. Of the remaining 9 patients, 3 each were due to prolonged waits for radiotherapy, medical events unrelated to
treatment, and to clerical error. Median time from diagnosis
of MIBC to commencement of NAC was 54 days (Fig. 1).
The median time taken for the course of chemotherapy was
28 days (Oxford 3-cycle regimen) and 42 days (Leeds 4cycle regimen), with an overall median of 34 days. All but 2
patients (97%) completed their course within 56 days. The

median time from the start of chemotherapy until definitive
treatment was 75 days (range, 40-259 days).
Tolerability and Toxicity

Detailed chemotherapy toxicity data are available on 34 of
80 patients (42%) (Fig. 2). Nine patients (26.5%) had 1

or more grade 3 or 4 toxicities. The most frequently
encountered grade 3 or 4 toxicities were neutropenia (in
11.8% of assessable patients), nausea and/or vomiting
(5.9%), fatigue (5.9%), stomatitis (5.9%), and diarrhea
(2.9%). Data were not systematically collected on surgical
complication rates following NAC.
Pathological Response Rates

Following NAC, 26 of all 60 surgical patients (43%) were
pT0 at cystectomy (pCR to treatment with transurethral
resection of bladder tumor [TURBT] plus neoadjuvant
chemotherapy); see top of right hand column, Table 2.
Twelve (20%) had residual muscle-invasive (pT2 or pT3)
disease; none of the cystectomy specimens contained T4
disease. Eleven (19%) of the 60 surgically treated patients
had 1 or more pelvic nodes containing viable tumor at
cystectomy, despite NAC. There was no significant difference between the proportions of patients with radiologically node-negative (rN0) or node-positive (rNþ) (15%
and 20%, respectively) prechemotherapy scans who subsequently had pNþ disease at cystectomy.

were seen both in preradiotherapy and in precystectomy
patients. Radiological response after NAC was evaluable
in 57 of 80 patients (71.2%) (Table 3). Complete
response was seen in 18 (32%) of these 57 patients and
partial response in a further 29 patients (51%), for an
overall response rate (rCR þ rPR) of 83%. There were no
statistically significant differences between response rates
and disease control rates seen in patients treated with
radiotherapy, compared to those seen in cystectomy
patients (data not shown). Radiological evidence of
disease progression was seen in 3 (5%) of all 57 radiologically evaluable patients. All but 1 of the patients who
underwent cystectomy and achieved a complete radiological response also had a pCR.
Recurrence

Detailed follow-up data are available on 78 patients
(97%). At a median follow-up of 27.5 months (range, 360 months), 32% (25 of 78) of assessable patients have
recurred with locoregionally advanced or distant metastatic disease (Table 4). Recurrence rates were much
higher in patients who were radiologically pelvic nodepositive prior to chemotherapy than in those who were
3924

node-negative (75% vs 24%). Higher recurrence rates
were seen in both node-negative and node-positive
patients treated with radiotherapy (36% and 80%, respectively) than in those treated with surgery (21% and 71%,
respectively), but this did not translate into a survival difference (see below).
Survival

Of the 78 patients for whom detailed follow-up data are
available, 65% remained recurrence-free at 2 years. Projected median DFS is more than 60 months (Fig. 3A).
There is a statistically significant difference (P ¼ .01) in
DFS for the node-negative (greater than 5 years) versus
node-positive patients (13 months) (Fig. 3A), but no statistically significant difference in DFS between groups
treated with radiotherapy and surgery (P ¼ .32).
Fifteen patients (19%) have died, in 11 (14%) of
whom death was attributable to bladder cancer (Table 4).
The 2-year OS was 77% and projected median OS is
more than 5 years (Fig. 3B). There was no statistically significant difference in OS between the node-positive,
node-negative, and all-patient groups, nor between the
surgery and radiotherapy groups.

DISCUSSION
Meta-analysis data10,11,21 support the routine use of neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy as
part of multimodality treatment with curative intent for
patients with MIBC. However, the trials on which this is
based include a variety of cisplatin-based regimens, resulting in a lack of consensus on the most appropriate regimen. We adopted AMVAC as our standard NAC
regimen for MIBC, on the basis of its impressive response
rates and DFS in the metastatic setting,19 and we present a
retrospective analysis of outcomes. Meta-analysis data and
the recent publication of mature data from the largest single trial of NAC13 demonstrate similar benefits for NAC,
regardless of whether radical surgery or radical radiotherapy was used to achieve local control. We therefore
analyzed data from all our NAC patients treated with
radical intent, whether local treatment involved surgery
or radiotherapy.
Our toxicity data, although retrospective and
incomplete, and therefore subject to selection and ascertainment bias, suggest that AMVAC is well-tolerated
and easily deliverable. The relative timings of endoscopic
diagnosis, NAC, and definitive therapy suggest that delays
to radical surgery or radiotherapy are acceptable.
The median time from diagnosis until definitive
treatment of 137 days is considerably less than the 208
days reported in a recently published contemporary series
employing predominantly GC chemotherapy.22 Intervals
between endoscopic diagnosis of MIBC and commencement of NAC, and between completion of NAC and definitive therapy, were almost entirely due to ‘‘real world’’
administrative issues including multidisciplinary team
discussion, second referral, radiotherapy, or operating
theater waiting lists, rather than arising from clinical
issues such as complications of treatment. Both the
median and range of times from initiation of NAC to
definitive treatment (10.7 weeks and 5.7-37 weeks,
respectively) compare favorably with those reported

recently in a retrospective analysis of 153 patients treated
with NAC prior to cystectomy (16.6 and 6.3-195.6
weeks, respectively).23 The same study has suggested that
the timing of cystectomy relative to NAC has little or no
effect upon survival.23 Nevertheless, 70% of our patients
waited less than 3 months from the start of chemotherapy
to definitive treatment. This may be partly attributable to
close multidisciplinary cooperation wherein the surgeon
or radiotherapist was given a projected earliest date for
definitive therapy as soon as the chemotherapy start date
was determined, permitting advance planning of surgery
or radiotherapy dates.
Concerns have previously been raised that surgery
after NAC might result in a larger proportion of postoperative complications. The primary focus of this analysis is
upon the outcomes of NAC, not upon surgical issues.
However, blood loss, operating time, transfusion rates,
and inpatient stay were felt by the specialist urological surgeons involved to be broadly comparable with patients
undergoing radical surgery without preceding NAC. A
separate formal study of surgical outcomes would be
required to confirm this, but this impression is supported
by mature data from an international study of NAC in
976 patients, including 428 patients undergoing cystectomy, which found that there was no evidence to suggest
that the addition of NAC made cystectomy more
dangerous.13
There is continuing controversy on the appropriate
approach to patients with enlarged pelvic nodes, as determined radiologically, and whether chemotherapy should
be used as the primary treatment modality in these
patients. Results presented here show a statistically significant difference in DFS between node-positive and nodenegative patients. We, and others, see cures in this group.
In a series of 30 patients with initially unresectable or
minimally metastatic disease, Ghadjar et al24 obtained a
pT0 rate of 30% and observed a radiological complete
response in enlarged pelvic lymph nodes in 16 of 21 rNþ
patients after ‘‘induction’’ platinum-based chemotherapy,
resulting in a projected DFS of 42%. However, it seems
likely that the benefit of chemotherapy is much lower
in the rNþ group, and chemotherapy used as primary
therapy for these patients should not be regarded as
genuinely neoadjuvant.
The survival advantage of NAC seen in meta-analysis is presumed to arise from the elimination of micrometastatic disease, rather than from improved local
disease control. However, rates of pCR (pT0), which predicts for improved survival,25,26 can be used as a surrogate
marker of systemic efficacy. Previously, pCR rates as high
3926

as 33% to 40% have been reported, compared to 6% to
15% in patients treated with TURBT alone (summarized
in Weight et al).22 The pCR rate of 43% reported here is
at least as good as any previously reported in this setting,
and is similar to the 38% figure reported in a previous
randomized study that included 126 patients treated with
neoadjuvant ‘‘classical’’ MVAC, followed by cystectomy.17 Our principal interest has been in the efficacy and
toxicity of NAC, not in drawing comparisons between
local treatment approaches. Nevertheless, our data support the need for further trials to investigate an organsparing, multimodality approach (including AMVAC as
NAC and radical radiotherapy) for patients with MIBC
who achieve a complete clinical (radiological plus cystoscopic) response to TURBT plus NAC. Our high pCR
figure is in contrast to the recently published figure of 7%
in a contemporary series of 29 patients treated predominantly with GC as NAC.22
Radiological complete response rates (32%) underestimated the pCR rate (43%). It is important to note that
quantitative assessment of bladder wall lesions by crosssectional imaging is particularly difficult,27 because disease is often seen as a diffuse thickening over a significant
area of urothelium, rather than as discrete, measurable
lesions. A further caveat is that the assessment method
used here is anatomical, rather than functional. Areas of
abnormality on cross-sectional imaging (including
enlarged nodes) may or may not represent viable tumor:
we saw several rN0/pNþ as well as rNþ/pN0 patients.
Functional imaging, such as positron emission tomography–computed tomography28 or diffusion-weighted
magnetic resonance29 scans may therefore be more appropriate for guiding potential bladder-conserving therapy,
which includes NAC, or for identifying early in a course
of chemotherapy those patients who are not responding,
and who would be better served by discontinuing chemotherapy early, and proceeding straight to definitive
treatment.
The 5% absolute survival benefit conferred by
NAC in meta-analysis means that systemic treatment
makes the difference between cure and no cure in only
1 patient in 20. The other 19 would either survive
without chemotherapy or will die despite it. Correlation
of functional imaging data with molecular biomarkers
predictive of response to, or toxicity from, NAC may
allow us to distinguish, on the basis of the molecular
characteristics of transurethral resection specimens
alone, between those patients whose best interests are
not served by NAC and those with the most to gain
from it.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published
report of the use of AMVAC as NAC for treatment of
MIBC. Although the retrospective analysis presented here
is of a relatively small cohort of patients with short followup and incomplete toxicity data, our results suggest that
AMVAC has many of the characteristics of an ideal NAC
regimen. It is safe, well-tolerated, and easily deliverable,
with high pathological and radiological response rates.
Radiological disease progression is rare, and delays to radical therapy are acceptable. No patients were deprived of
definitive therapy by receiving NAC. AMVAC therefore
represents an acceptable regimen for use on a routine, offtrial basis and is an appropriate comparator for future
randomized trials of NAC for MIBC.
