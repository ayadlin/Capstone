ABSTRACT
Galunisertib (LY2157299) is a selective ATP-mimetic inhibitor of TGF-β receptor
(TβR)-I activation currently under clinical investigation in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) patients. Our study explored the effects of galunisertib in vitro in HCC cell lines
and ex vivo on patient samples. Galunisertib was evaluated in HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7,
JHH6 and SK-HEP1 cells as well as in SK-HEP1-derived cells tolerant to sorafenib
(SK-Sora) and sunitinib (SK-Suni). Exogenous stimulation of all HCC cell lines with
TGF-β yielded downstream activation of p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 that was potently
inhibited with galunisertib treatment at micromolar concentrations. Despite limited
antiproliferative effects, galunisertib yielded potent anti-invasive properties. Tumor
slices from 13 patients with HCC surgically resected were exposed ex vivo to 1 µM
and 10 µM galunisertib, 5 µM sorafenib or a combination of both drugs for 48 hours.
Galunisertib but not sorafenib decreased p-Smad2/3 downstream TGF-β signaling.
Immunohistochemistry analysis of galunisertib and sorafenib-exposed samples
showed a significant decrease of the proliferative marker Ki67 and increase of the
apoptotic marker caspase-3. In combination, galunisertib potentiated the effect of
sorafenib efficiently by inhibiting proliferation and increasing apoptosis. Our data
suggest that galunisertib may be active in patients with HCC and could potentiate
the effects of sorafenib.

INTRODUCTION

either hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) infection, alcohol
consumption (cirrhosis), inherited metabolic disease
and dysmetabolic syndrome such as nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease. In recent years, TGF-β pathway has
gained considerable interest due to its pleiotropic role
in regulating cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and
motility at the tumor level, as well as extracellular matrix
production, angiogenesis, and cellular immune response
at the tumor microenvironment level [4-6]. TGF-β signals

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
most deadly cancers whose incidence follows a rising
trend worldwide [1]. It is also a disease with very
few therapeutic options at advanced stage, in which
sorafenib remains the only approved drug since 2007
based on the results of two randomized studies [2,
3]. Most HCCs develop on pathological livers due to

through binding to TGF-β type II receptors (TGFBRII)
that dimerize with TGF-β type I receptors (TGFBRI)
and activates the TGF-β dependent canonical signal
transducers SMADs. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3
then form a trimeric complex with Smad4 that translocates
to the nucleus interacting with various transcription factors
to activate or repress hundreds of target genes. At Smad
levels, TGF-β pathway integrates signaling from integrins,
Notch, Wnt, TNF-α, or EGF-dependent pathways as well
as signals from cellular processes such as the cell-cycle or
apoptosis machineries.
TGF-β exerts a dual role on HCC tumorigenesis
displaying tumor suppressive properties at early stage
while promoting tumor progression at later stage [6, 7].
The switch from cytostatic to pro-tumorogenic properties
is thought to depend on TGF-β pathway alterations as
well as signal integration from other pathways. Despite
some occurrences affecting the TGFBRII gene, mutations
in the TGF-β pathway are rare in HCC [8, 9]. In few
HCC subsets, low expression levels of TGF-β receptors
or of the inhibitory protein Smad7, as well as increased
expression of Smad4, have been correlated with poor
prognosis, but data need to be consolidated to reach a
definitive consensus [10-14]. Therefore, crosstalks and
TGF-β coupling with other signalling pathways is thought
to be critically important for tumor progression, notably
to circumvent the initial cytostatic effect of the TGF-β
pathway. Early events of HCC carcinogenesis may thus
require lowering TGF-β activity while relieving growth
inhibition. As such, increased expression of Smad7
and repression of Smad2 and Smad3 expression are
characteristics of the early TGF-β signature as defined
by Coulouarn and colleagues [15] whereas mutations in
the cell-cycle inhibitor p16INK4 are present in most HCC
[16]. In contrast, late carcinogenesis events, such as
cancer dissemination, are characterized by cytoskeleton
reorganization, modification of cell-cell adhesion, matrix
remodelling and migration, which imply modulation of
several genes such as Vimentin and β1-integrin whose
expressions have been described in the late TGF-β
signature [17]. TGF-β pathway activation has been shown
to correlate with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) which itself is associated with poor prognosis [18].
Increased expression of circulating TGF-β1 and alpha
feto-protein (AFP) expression are considered hallmarks
of the disease [19, 20]. TGF-β1 inhibition reduces cell
invasiveness, possibly via partial EMT reversion in vitro,
and reduction of both TGF-β1, and AFP plasma levels
have been shown to be associated with effective therapy
in HCC patients [17, 21]. Accumulating evidence shows
that TGF-β can activate and cooperate with pathways
involved in invasion and metastasis (e.g., MAPK,
PI3K/AKT/mTOR, NF-κB, Notch, Wnt, and CXCR4)
through Smad2/3-dependent and -independent signalling
mechanisms [22].
Galunisertib (LY2157299), a selective ATP-mimetic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitor of TGFBRI, is the only TGF-β pathway inhibitor
currently under clinical investigation in HCC patients
(NCT01246986). In a recent paper, galunisertib has been
shown to efficiently inhibit the expression of p-Smad2 as
well as invasion but not proliferation in 3 HCC models in
vitro [23, 24]]. The aim of this study was to characterize
galunisertib effects on a different set of HCC models for
proliferation and invasion and investigate its effect on
canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling. We also
tested the potential combinability of galunisertib with
sorafenib in cells and ex vivo models, i.e., in fresh tumor
explants maintained alive for several days. Using HCC
fresh tumor explants to test TGF-β inhibitors has not been
described yet and may represent an interesting way to test
potential new therapeutics in HCC.

RESULTS
Characterization of HCC models for TGF-β
dependency
Given the dual role of TGF-β, displaying either
cytostatic or pro-tumorogenic properties, we first
characterized our 7 HCC cell lines for TGF-β pathway
protein expression (TGFΒR1, TGFΒR2, Smad2, Smad3,
Smad4, Smad7) and TGF-β dependent effects on cell
proliferation in order to select the most appropriate models
to study TGF-β inhibitors. We also characterized the cell
panel for expression of mesenchymal (Vimentin, c-MET,
and Slug) or epithelial (E-cadherin and β-catenin) markers
and for AFP expression using Western blot (Figure 1A and
1B).
JHH6 had the particularity to express the highest
levels of TGFBR1, Smad2, and Smad3 without expressing
Vimentin or E-cadherin but expressing c-MET and Slug. In
contrast, SK-HEP1 was characterized by low expression of
most TGF-β pathway-related proteins with the exception
of Smad2. SK-HEP1 displayed a strong mesenchymal
phenotype with expression of Vimentin, c-MET, and
Slug, without expression of E-cadherin or β-catenin.
Drug-tolerant cell lines, SK-Suni and SK-Sora, displayed
a protein expression profile similar to the parental SKHEP1 but increased Smad3 and Smad4 expression as well
as an exacerbated mesenchymal phenotype characterized
by high c-MET expression; of note, SK-Suni displayed
increased expression of the inhibitory Smad7 compared
to SK-Sora (Figure 1A and 1B). All these cell lines were
negative for AFP expression. The other cell lines, HepG2,
HuH7 and Hep3B, displayed an epithelial phenotype, i.e.,
expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin and low or no
expression of c-MET and Slug. HepG2 was specifically
characterized by its expression of both TGFBR1 and
TGFBR2, as well as Smad7. In contrast, HuH7 and Hep3B
expressed very low levels of TGF-β receptors. Both

HepG2 and HuH7 expressed Smad2 and Smad4 but a low
level of Smad3 whereas Hep3B was characterized by low
expression of all Smads (Figure 1A and 1B). Among all
these models, HepG2 and HuH7 were the only cell lines
to express AFP (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1).
Expression of the TGF-β ligands TGF-β1, TGF-β2,
and TGF-β3 was assessed by qRT-PCR. TGF-β1 and
TGF-β2 expression levels were increased in SK-HEP1,
SK-Suni, and SK-Sora compared to HepG2 and Hep3B.
TGF-β3 expression displayed a reverse pattern with higher
expression in HepG2 and Hep3B than in SK-Hep1 cell
lines (data not shown).
Differential expression pattern of E-cadherin,
Vimentin, c-MET, Slug, and TGF-β1 suggested that SKwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HEP1, SK-Suni, SK-Sora, and JHH6 belonged to the late
TGF-β signature subgroup whereas HepG2, HuH7 and
Hep3B belonged to the early TGF-β signature subgroup
of HCC models as previously described (15). Since early
TGF-β signature HCC models are expected to be sensitive
to TGF-β antiproliferative effects but not late TGF-β
signature models, we tested TGF-β growth inhibition
on our 7 cell lines (Figure 1C-1E). SK-HEP1, SK-Suni,
SK-Sora, and JHH6 did not display TGF-β dependent
cytostasis. JHH6, which has the particularity of expressing
neither E-cadherin nor Vimentin and was very weakly
responsive to TGF-β pathway activation might be more
representative of the negative TGF-β rather than the late
signature subgroup. Overall, these results support the use

of late TGF-β signature cell lines as the most appropriate
models to study the direct effects of TGF-β inhibitors
(Table 1).

Galunisertib effects on canonical
noncanonical TGF-β signalling

for 1 µM galunisertib. After 24 hours exposure of 10
µM galunisertib, only residual p-Smad2 expression was
detectable. In contrast to p-Smad2 expression, galunisertib
moderately affected PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways.
Some transient effects were observed at 5 hours, but after
24 hours exposure to galunisertib, expression of p-ERK1/2
and p-AKT were unchanged compared to baseline levels
in SK-HEP1, SK-Suni, Hep3B, and HuH7 (Figure 2).
In SK-Sora, HepG2, and JHH6, 24-hour exposure of
galunisertib significantly inhibited p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT
expression (Figure 2C and 2D). Interestingly, PI3K/AKT
pathway inhibition by galunisertib was independent from
exogenous TGF-β stimulation. Moreover, after 24 hours
of galunisertib exposure, potent inhibition of p-S6, a
downstream target of mTOR, was observed in all cell lines
except HUH7. In conclusion, galunisertib displayed potent
inhibition of canonical TGF-β signalling in 6 out of 7 HCC
models and selected inhibition of noncanonical pathways
in several models. The exquisite sensitivity of canonical
and noncanonical TGF-β pathways signalling inhibition
by galunisertib in the sorafenib-resistant cell line SK-Sora
warranted exploration of galunisertib in combination with
sorafenib (see below).

and

To study the effects of galunisertib on intracellular
signalling, HCC cells were incubated in serum-free
medium overnight and treated with 5 ng/mL of TGF-β for
1 hour followed by the addition of 1 or 10 µM galunisertib
for 5 and 24 hours. Concentrations were selected to be in
the range of observed plasma exposure [25].
Addition of TGF-β induced substantial activation
of Smad-dependent canonical pathways as shown by
the increased expression of p-Smad2 in all models
except in JHH6 cell line (Figure 2). Moreover, TGF-β
addition induced slight activation of the noncanonical
PI3K/AKT and/or MAPK pathways in SK-HEP1, SKSuni, HepG2, and JHH6 but not in the other cell lines.
Addition of galunisertib reduced the expression levels of
p-Smad2 in all cell lines in a dose and time-dependent
manner independently of TGF-β induction. In SK-HEP1,
HepG2, and Hep3B, a significant reduction of p-Smad2
expression was observed at early time point (5 hours)

Galunisertib exerted limited antiproliferative but
strong anti-invasive effects

4B). Galunisertib displayed a slight dose-dependent
potentiation of sorafenib in SK-Sora, HepG2, and Hep3B
cell lines but not in JHH6, SK-HEP1, and HuH7 cell lines.

Cancer cell lines were exposed continuously to 0.1,
1.0, 10, and 100 µM galunisertib in presence or absence
of TGF-β (5 ng/mL) and assessed for inhibition of cellular
proliferation after 72- and 96-hour incubations using the
MTT assay. In the late TGF-β signature cell group, no
effects on proliferation were observed in SK-HEP1, SKSuni, SK-Sora, and JHH6 exposed to concentrations of
galunisertib below 100 µM with or without TGF-β (Figure
3A, Supplementary Figure 2). In the early TGF-β signature
cell group, HepG2, Hep3B, and HuH7 cell lines were
sensitive to TGF-β dependent growth inhibition and also
displayed limited sensitivity to galunisertib (Figure 3A).
In these cells, 0.1 to 10 µM galunisertib seemed to reverse
TGF-β cytostatic effects in a dose-dependent manner. High
galunisertib concentrations (100 μM) displayed TGF-β
independent antiproliferative effects in most cells without
exhibiting cytotoxic effects (Figure 3A and Supplementary
Figure 2). Given limited antiproliferative effects in vitro,
we decided to examine the effects of galunisertib on
extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading capabilities of
the invasive models of our HCC panel, i.e., SK-HEP1,
SK-Suni, and SK-Sora and their ability to penetrate the
basement membrane and migrate into its supporting
connective tissue. We used the OptiCell assay to directly
visualize the invasion process (see Material and Methods).
Fibroblasts embedded into type I collagen secreted a high
level of TGF-β (1 ng/mL after 3 days) as detected by
ELISA assay (data not shown). Direct monitoring of the
multilayer cell construct showed that SK-HEP1, SK-Suni,
and SK-Sora cells were able to penetrate into the collagen/
fibroblasts gel after 7 days (Figure 3C). Pretreatment with
10 µM galunisertib strongly decreased cells migration into
the gel. These results confirmed that galunisertib displays
strong anti-invasive properties on HCC cell lines.

Ex vivo effects of galunisertib on tumor explants
from hepatocellular carcinoma patients
Since the importance of the TGF-β pathway
heavily relies on its tumour microenvironment, we
used an ex vivo methodology in which explanted tumor
slices are maintained alive in culture and treated with
pharmacologically active drug concentrations. Different
experimental conditions are intended to be reproduced
between each tumor sample with the limitation of the
number of slices available (Figure 5). After patients’
consents, fresh tumor samples were obtained from
the surgery department. A total of 13 patient samples
were analyzed. Clinical and pathological patients’
characteristics are summarized in Table 2. Tumors were
sliced and incubated 48 hours with 10 µM galunisertib
with or without sorafenib. After incubation, the slices were
embedded in paraffin, HE stained, and analyzed by IHC
for proliferation (MIB1/Ki67), apoptosis (caspase-3), AFP
expression, and by immunofluorescence for downstream
canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signalling, i.e.,
p-SMAD2/3, p-ERK1/2, and p-AKT expression. Figure
5A represents typical results obtained with HCC tumors.
Significant decrease of MIB1/Ki67 staining was observed
in patient samples treated with galunisertib (54%, 7
out of 13 samples displayed >25% decrease in protein
expression), sorafenib (77%, 10/13) or both (67%, 6/9)
(Figure 5B and Supplementary Table 1). In addition, a
significant increase of caspase-3 staining was observed
after galunisertib treatment (54%, 7 out of 13 samples
displayed >25% increase in protein expression), sorafenib
(62%, 8/13) or both (56%, 5/9).
To determine whether responsive tumors may
belong to the late TGF-beta signature subgroup we
assessed the expression of c-MET at baseline, Vimentin
being detected at similar levels across all control tumor
samples. c-MET expression varied from 17.8% positivity
to 71.1% (median = 6.9%) and High c-MET expression
was defined as positive expression ≥46.9%. Response
parameters (proliferation, apoptosis, pSMAD2/3, pAKT
pERK) were not different between the high and low
c-MET groups despite a trend between an association
of high c-MET expression with increased apoptosis
induction in the Galunisertib+sorafenib subgroup (p =
0.08). However, the small number of tumor explants in
this study inherently limits the significance of the results,
which must be confirmed in larger studies.
In 2 IHC AFP-positive patient samples (patients 03
and 09), AFP staining slightly decreased after 48 hours
of treatment with galunisertib and galunisertib/sorafenib
combination but not with sorafenib alone (Figure 5A).

In vitro combinations of galunisertib with
sorafenib
We further explored the effects of galunisertib
in combination with sorafenib in our models. We first
determined the sorafenib sensitivity profile of our cell-line
panel in presence or absence of TGF-β (Figure 4A). All
cell lines displayed a dose-dependent sensitivity towards
increasing sorafenib concentrations that was not influenced
by exogenous TGF-β addition. SK-HEP1 appeared to be
the most sensitive cell line, SK-Sora and JHH6 being
the most resistant cells of our panel. HepG2, Hep3B,
and HuH7 displayed similar intermediate sensitivity.
To explore the potential of combining galunisertib with
sorafenib in HCC cells, cell lines were simultaneously
exposed to 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 µM galunisertib with 5
µM sorafenib in presence of TGF-β for 72 hours (Figure

As expected, immunofluorescence analysis of TGF-β
signalling showed a significant decrease in p-SMAD2/3
expression after galunisertib exposure that was mostly
unchanged after sorafenib treatment (Figure 5B). P-AKT
and p-ERK staining were both decreased in 60% of the
samples when treated with galunisertib (6 out of 10
samples displayed >25% decrease in protein expression)
and in 90% (9/10) when treated by sorafenib alone.
Interestingly, p-SMAD2/3, p-AKT, and p-ERK staining
were strongly inhibited in all samples when treated by a
combination of galunisertib and sorafenib. Overall, short
exposure of patients’ samples to galunisertib, sorafenib,
or a combination of both treatments reduced proliferation
and increased apoptosis. All 3 treatments affected
noncanonical TGF-β signalling. Potentiation of sorafenib
effects on PI3K/AKT and MAPK signalling pathways by
galunisertib suggests potential antiproliferative synergy in
long-term exposure. Overall analysis of patient samples
demonstrated a response on both proliferation and
apoptosis for galunisertib and/or galunisertib/sorafenib
combination in 6 out of 13 patients: 02, 03, 05, 07, 09,
and 11. In these patients, drugs induced significant
proliferation decrease (>10%) and apoptosis induction
(>50%). All these patients were characterized for well or
moderately differentiated HCC. In contrast, the poorly
differentiated HCC sample #12 treated with galunisertib
did not respond to the drug. The 2 HCC displaying high
AFP levels by IHC were sensitive to the ex vivo treatment
by galunisertib and its combination with sorafenib. No
clear correlation of tumor response with sex, age, etiology,
and number of satellite nodules was found in this panel of
13 HCCs.

noncanonical TGF-β pathway inhibition.
Many authors have attempted to refine the
molecular classification of HCC and decipher the role
of TGF-β in liver carcinogenesis [26, 27]. These studies
have highlighted interesting features of HCC tumors that
may be relevant to liver carcinogenesis and treatments
such as CTNNB1 mutations, Wnt and TGF-β pathway
alterations, AFP expression, or virus infection [15, 16,
26-28]. One of the most relevant works for our study
came from Coulouarn et al. for its characterization of
a HCC TGF-β signature which subdivides HCC into
positive and negative TGF-β signature subgroups [15].
Interestingly, within the positive TGF-β signature
subgroups, they identified 2 signatures, an “early” and
a “late” TGF-β signature that effectively discriminate
patients’ populations in 2 very different prognostic
groups. Compared to the “early” TGF-β, the “late” TGF-β
signature population was significantly associated with
shorter survival, increased recurrence, HBV infection,
vascular invasion, and a positive c-MET-regulated gene
expression signature. In contrast, tumor size, Edmonson
grade, or AFP levels were not discriminatory between
the 2 populations. In terms of survival and recurrence,
the negative TGF-β signature subgroup, which represents
approximately 50% of HCC, displayed intermediate risk
compared to “early” and “late” subgroups [15]. Work from
Hoshida and colleagues [26] showed that the “late” TGF-β
signature as defined by Coulouarn and colleagues was
strongly associated with one of their 3 HCC subclasses,
the S1 subclass characterized by activation of the TGF-β
and Wnt pathways whereas their S2 subclass, which is still
associated with poor prognostic HCC, was characterized
by Myc and AKT activation and positive EpCAM gene
signatures as well as elevated serum AFP levels [26].
Authors extended the early and late TGF-β signatures to in
vitro cell-lines models showing that these models, usually
thought to represent late-stage HCC, may in fact reflect
various clinical and molecular HCC subclasses and can
recapitulate the 2 TGF-β signature subgroups observed in
patients [15, 24].
Besides the cell lines that pertain to early TGF-β
signature (HepG2, Hep3B, and HuH7), we were most
interested by those that were archetypal of the “late
TGF-β signature”, i.e., SK-HEP1, SK-Suni, and SK-Sora.
Those cell lines were invasive, insensitive to the cytostatic
effects of TGF-β, but responsive to TGF-β activation
and could mimic certain late stages HCC in the clinic,
particularly those previously treated with sorafenib. These
cells harbored a mesenchymal phenotype expressing
Vimentin, Slug, and increased c-MET levels. Our study
confirmed previous work on TGF-β inhibitors, including
galunisertib, showing that these inhibitors displayed
limited antiproliferative effects [23]. In the “early” TGF-β
signature models, galunisertib displayed a dose-dependent
inhibition of TGF-β dependent cytostasis, whereas in
the “late” TGF-β signature models neither TGF-β nor

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we showed that galunisertib
displayed potent inhibition of canonical and noncanonical
pathways in a variety of in vitro cell-lines models likely
representing different types of HCC. Galunisertib
displayed potent inhibition of the canonical TGF-β
pathway as visualized through inhibition of p-Smad2
expression in all models. It also displayed various degrees
of inhibition towards noncanonical TGF-β pathways such
as MAPK or PI3K/AKT/mTOR. We also observed that
galunisertib inhibition on noncanonical TGF-β signaling
could be TGF-β independent. Interestingly, the SK-Sora
cell lines displayed enhanced canonical and noncanonical
TGF-β pathway inhibition suggesting that sorafenibtolerant cells remain sensitive to TGF-β inhibition.
Despite limited antiproliferative activity in vitro, we
confirmed results from Dituri and colleagues [23] that
galunisertib had potent anti-invasive activity and showed
that in ex vivo models elaborated directly from patients,
TGF-β inhibition can display antiproliferative activity.
Moreover, in those fresh tumor explants, galunisertib and
sorafenib combination displayed enhanced canonical and

galunisertib displayed anti-proliferative effects. Of note,
high galunisertib concentrations (100 µM) seemed to
display nonspecific proliferation inhibition affecting
most models. In contrast, galunisertib potently inhibited
invasion of the mesenchymal cells confirming the results
of Dituri and colleagues on HLE and HLF cell lines that
both belong to the “late” TGF-β signature subgroup [15,
23].
Many studies have demonstrated the role of TGF-β
in stimulating EMT transition [5, 27, 29] that mimics our
previous report of a patient with advanced HCC treated
with VEGFR inhibitor-displaying tumor morphology
reflecting EMT transition [5, 29, 30, 31]. Pathological
examination on post-treatment specimens revealed the
presence of 2 juxtaposed tissue components containing
either sarcomatoid-like mesenchymal cells or wellto moderately differentiated HCC cells with a part of
sarcomatoid tissue.
We showed that galunisertib inhibited TGF-β
canonical pathway in most HCC cells regardless of their
epithelial or mesenchymal differentiation or TGF-β
pathway proteins expression. Galunisertib exposure
had various effects on noncanonical pathways in cells
previously stimulated by TGF-β that were enhanced
at higher concentrations and longer exposure time.
Interestingly, noncanonical TGF-β signalling in cell
lines with acquired resistance to sorafenib seemed to be
particularly sensitive to galunisertib.
It has long been recognized that the role of TGF-β
signaling in carcinogenesis is dependent and executed
at both tumor and tumor microenvironment levels.
This is especially true in HCC, in which tumors mostly
develop on pathologic livers. It is thus difficult to reach
definitive conclusion from in vitro cell-line experiments
because of the importance of strong risk factors related
to the HCC environment such as vascular invasion or the
underlying liver pathology such as cirrhosis or fibrosis.
Besides, other elements of the liver microenvironment
have been shown to play a role in HCC development
such as activated pericytes or immune cells that expressed
many pro-oncogenic growth factors and cytokines. This
is the reason why we chose to test galunisertib in a more
physiological context, in which fresh tumor slices directly
extracted from patients are maintained alive in their own
tissue microenvironment. In these tissues, we confirmed
that exposure ex vivo samples to galunisertib for 48 hours
led to significant inhibition of canonical (p-Smad2) and
noncanonical (p-AKT, p-ERK) TGF-β pathway signaling.
Moreover, galunisertib induced decreased proliferation
markers and increased apoptosis. Sorafenib treatment
alone also decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis.
Combination of sorafenib with galunisertib increased the
effects on cell-signalling inhibition and consequently the
antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of the treatment.
Interestingly, these effects were independent of AFP
expression level. All these data may reinforce the basis for

clinical use of galunisertib in combination with sorafenib
in HCC patients.
Galunisertib is currently under clinical investigation
in HCC patients in second line after sorafenib failure or in
patients ineligible for sorafenib. Preliminary results from
a phase II clinical trial have shown improved clinical
outcome and also changes consistent with a reduction
of EMT [32, 33]. Extension of the study to galunisertib
in combination with sorafenib in first line is currently in
progress (NCT01246986).
In conclusion, we showed that TGF-β inhibition
using galunisertib is effective in vitro on invasive tumor
models as well as ex vivo alone or in combination with
sorafenib. Combination with sorafenib exacerbated
canonical and noncanonical TGF-β pathway inhibition.
These data support the use of TGF-β inhibition in
advanced HCC with a positive perspective regarding its
potential combination with sorafenib in the clinic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Hepatocellular carcinoma SK-HEP1, HepG2,
Hep3B cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville,
MD). JHH6 and HuH7 cell lines were purchased from
JCRB cell bank, Japan. SK-Suni and SK-Sora are
variants of SK-HEP1 exposed to stepwise increasing
concentrations of sunitinib or sorafenib (0.1-10 µM) for
more than 6 months. Cells were grown as monolayers in
RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France), 2 mM glutamine,
100 units/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin at
37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere and regularly
checked for the absence of Mycoplasma.

Cell cytotoxicity assay
Cell survival was determined using the MTT assay
(3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide; Sigma, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). The
conversion of yellow water-soluble tetrazolium MTT into
purple insoluble formazan is catalyzed by mitochondrial
dehydrogenases and used to estimate the number of
viable cells. In brief, cells were seeded in 96-well tissue
culture plates at a density of 2 x 103 cells/well. After drug
exposure, cells were incubated with 0.4 mg/mL MTT for
4 hours at 37°C. After incubation, the supernatant was
discarded, insoluble formazan precipitates were dissolved
in 0.1 mL of DMSO, and the absorbance was measured at
560 nm by use of a microplate reader (Thermo, France).
Wells with untreated cells or with drug-containing medium
without cells were used as positive and negative controls
respectively. For proliferation assay, MTT assay was done

daily to determine the number of viable cells in untreated
control and galunisertib-treated group. Galunisertib was
supplied by Eli Lilly. Human TGF-β1 was obtained from
R&D Systems.

by the hospital pathologist, the tumor samples were
extemporaneously sliced using Tissue Slicer® instrument
into 300µm-thick slices and cultured “alive” at 37°C into
the William’s E medium, complemented with in-house
proprietary dedicated components including foetal calf
serum, glucose, gentamicin and HEPES, under normoxic
conditions. The samples were prepared using tissue-slicer
technology and treated for 24 to 72 hours with 1 and 10
µM galunisertib or 5 µM sorafenib. After 24 to 72 hours
treatment, the explanted HCC was paraffin embedded and
assessed for expression of selected markers. The tests
comprised assessment of cancer cell proliferation (MIB1/
Ki67), death (active caspase- 3), and several changes in
cell signalling (phospho-kinases). Tissue quality was
assessed by a pathologist. If tissue integrity was not
maintained over time (>20% necrosis induction), tissues
were discarded.

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
The theoretical and practical aspects of real-time
quantitative RT-PCR using the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence
Detection System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) have been described in detail
elsewhere. Results were expressed as n-fold differences
in target gene expression relative to the TBP gene (an
endogenous RNA control) and relative to a calibrator (1X
sample), consisting of the cell-line sample from our tested
series that contained the smallest amount of target gene
mRNA. Experiments were performed in duplicate.

Immunofluorescence

Western blot analysis

Tumor slices were fixed in 4% of paraformaldhyde
for 15 minutes. Incubation with primary antibodies
p-SMAD2/3, p-AKT, p-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling) was
performed at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation with
the secondary antibody (anti- Alexa Fluor® 488 Rabbit
IgG (H+L) F(ab’)2, Cell Signaling, France) for 1 hour
at room temperature in the dark. The nuclei were stained
with Dapi 1:20000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, California, USA). The images were captured and
analyzed with a Zeiss observer Z1 microscope. Images
quantification was performed using Histolab Software
(Microvision, France) subtracting the background.

Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM
HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2
mM sodium vanadate, 100 mM NaF, and 0.4 mg/mL
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Equal amounts of protein
(30µg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked
with 5% milk in 0.05% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered
saline and then incubated with the primary antibody
overnight. Membranes were then washed and incubated
with the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase. Bands were visualized by using the enhanced
chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system.
Densitometric analysis was performed under conditions
that yielded a linear response.

Immunohistochemistry

Modified OptiCell invasion assay

The immunohistochemical (IHC) procedure
was performed on paraffin-embedded tumor samples.
MIB1/Ki67, caspase-3, c-MET and AFP stainings were
performed using automat after the standard procedure
used for clinical samples. The images were captured and
analyzed with a Zeiss observer Z1 microscope. Images
quantification was performed using Histolab Software
(Microvision, France) subtracting the background.

Dermal fibroblasts were embedded in a collagen
gel at a density of 105 fibroblasts/ml and then injected
vertically on Nunc OptiCell system (Thermo fisher
scientific, Waltham, MA) until its polymerization. SKHEP1, SK-Suni, and SK-Sora cancer cells were then added
on top of the gel at a density of 105 cells/ml. The whole
system was incubated for 1 week at 37°C in humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2, and cancer cell migration was
analyzed daily using epifluorescent microscopy.
