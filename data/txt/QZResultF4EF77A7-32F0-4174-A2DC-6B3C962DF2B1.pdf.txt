Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MEK inhibitors are clinically active in BRAFV600E melanomas, but only marginally so in KRASmutant tumors. Here we found that MEK inhibitors suppress ERK signaling more potently in
BRAFV600E- than in KRAS-mutant tumors. To understand this, we performed an RNAi screen in
a KRAS-mutant model and found that CRAF knockdown enhanced MEK inhibition. MEK
activated by CRAF was less susceptible to MEK inhibitors than when activated by BRAFV600E.
MEK inhibitors induced RAF-MEK complexes in KRAS mutant models, and disrupting such
complexes enhanced inhibition of CRAF-dependent ERK signaling. Newer MEK inhibitors not
only target MEK catalytic activity, but also impair its reactivation by CRAF: either by disrupting
RAF-MEK complexes or by interacting with Ser 222 to prevent RAF-mediated phosphorylation in
the complex.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Oncogenic KRAS mutations are common in cancer. Active RAS mediates its effects on
tumor formation through a number of effector proteins, including RAF, PI3K and RAL
(Blasco et al., 2011; Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2005; Gupta et al., 2007; Kolch et al., 1991).
Active RAS causes dimerization and activation of RAF kinases. This initiates a signaling
cascade in which RAF phosphorylates and activates MEK, which, in turn phosphorylates
and activates ERK (reviewed in Schubbert et al., 2007; Wellbrock et al., 2004). Under
physiologic conditions, the amplitude and duration of ERK signaling are regulated by ERKdependent feedback inhibition of multiple components of the pathway, including receptors,
exchange factors, CRAF and ERK itself (Dong et al., 1996; Dougherty et al., 2005; Douville
and Downward, 1997).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The importance of ERK signaling in cancers with mutant RAS has been demonstrated in
experimental systems in which genetic and pharmacologic manipulation shows that this
cascade is required for tumor initiation and maintenance (reviewed in Pylayeva-Gupta et al.,
2011). The widespread importance of ERK signaling in cancer is also demonstrated by the
frequent occurrence of mutations in other members of this pathway, especially BRAF
mutations that occur frequently in melanomas, thyroid and other cancers (Davies et al.,
2002).
RAF and MEK inhibitors have been developed as potential therapeutics in an effort to
inhibit the growth of tumors dependent on ERK signaling (Bollag et al., 2012; McCubrey et
al., 2010; Sebolt-Leopold et al., 1999). RAF inhibitors inhibit ERK signaling in tumors
harboring BRAFV600E/K mutations (Heidorn et al., 2010; Joseph et al., 2010; Poulikakos et
al., 2010), and have remarkable therapeutic activity in melanomas harboring these mutations
(Bollag et al., 2010; Chapman et al., 2011). In other tumors, however, including those with
mutant RAS, RAF inhibitors transactivate RAF dimers and stimulate ERK signaling. In
contrast, allosteric MEK inhibitors suppress ERK signaling in all normal and tumor cells
(Pratilas et al., 2008; Solit et al., 2006). Yet, whereas MEK inhibitors have significant
antitumor activity in BRAFV600E tumors (Flaherty et al., 2012), their effectiveness is
marginal in tumors with KRAS mutations. We have now investigated the basis for this
genotype-specific differential sensitivity.

Results
KRAS mutant tumors are less sensitive to MEK inhibitors than BRAF mutant tumors
We examined the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) dataset (Yang et al.,
2013) to correlate the sensitivity of tumor cells to MEK inhibitors with cancer genotype. The
mean IC50s for three such compounds, i.e. selumetinib, RDEA119 and PD0325901, were
compared in tumors harboring BRAF or RAS mutations and those with wild type alleles for
these genes. Tumors of various lineages were included in this analysis. Sensitivity to MEK
inhibition was correlated with the presence of oncogenic mutations and with the particular
oncoprotein responsible for activating the pathway (Figure S1A and below). The mean IC50
for each compound was higher in KRAS mutant tumors than in BRAF-mutant tumors,
whereas NRAS mutant tumors had an intermediate sensitivity.

In order to investigate the reason for the reduced sensitivity of KRAS mutant tumors to
MEK inhibitors, we first confirmed the mutation-dependent sensitivity to PD0325901 in a
group of melanoma (M) and lung (L) cancer cell lines harboring BRAFV600E (A375M,
MV522L and HCC364L) or KRASG12C/S (H358L, A549L and H2030L) mutations. As
predicted, the latter were significantly less sensitive than the former (Figure 1A). Three
hours after treatment, 40-50 nM PD0325901 was found to inhibit ERK phosphorylation
more than 95% both in KRAS and BRAF mutant tumors (Figure 1B and S1B). We used this
dose to ask whether the difference in sensitivity between the genotypes was associated with
a difference in the durability of inhibition of ERK signaling over time. In KRAS mutant
lung cancer cell lines prolonged PD0325901 exposure was unable to produce sustained ERK
inhibition as indicated by a rebound in ERK phosphorylation after 24-48 hours (Figure 2C).
The magnitude of this rebound ranged from 25% to 75% of the pretreatment ERK
phosphorylation (Figure 2D) and also occurred in KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cells
(Figure S1B). In contrast, much less pERK rebound was observed in BRAFV600E cell lines
(Figure 2C and D). These data imply that the reduced efficacy of PD0325901 in KRAS
mutant cancers may result from an inability to sustain pathway inhibition.

CRAF knockdown enhances the antiproliferative effect of MEK inhibition in KRAS-mutant
tumors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The difference in sensitivity between BRAF and KRAS mutant tumors may reflect the fact
that MEK is the major substrate of mutant BRAF whereas mutant KRAS signals through
multiple effectors. We hypothesized that the ability of MEK inhibitors to inhibit the
proliferation of KRAS mutant cells would be augmented by concurrent targeting of other
RAS-effector pathways. To address this possibility in a non-biased way, we performed an
shRNA screen to identify genes whose inhibition sensitize mutant KRAS tumors to
PD0325901 inhibition using a well-characterized genetic model of mutant KRAS-induced
pancreatic cancer. In order to develop a system in which shRNA expression is conditionally
induced by tetracycline, we engineered a “TET-ON” competent murine pancreatic cancer
cell line using pancreatic progenitor cells isolated from a murine fetus harboring an
endogenous KrasG12D mutation. These cells were engineered to express c-Myc and a potent
p53-specific shRNA, linked to a reverse tet transactivator (Figure S1C-E). Orthotopic
injection of these cells into the pancreas of a recipient mouse resulted in a tumor that
displayed key histological characteristics of human pancreatic cancer (Figure S1F). A cell
line derived from such tumors, referred to as KRPC, was dependent on KRAS (data not
shown) and capable of inducible shRNA expression. KRPC cells also exhibited rebound
ERK phosphorylation after treatment with PD0325901 (Figure S1G), similar to that in
human KRAS mutant lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines.
KRPC cells were transduced with a dox-inducible shRNA library containing a panel of
reporter-validated shRNAs (Fellmann et al., 2011; Zuber et al., 2011) that target 70 genes
encoding various components of RAS effector pathways. Dox-induction of shRNA
expression was followed by treatment with either DMSO or PD0325901 in order to identify
shRNAs that were selectively depleted after 10 days of MEK inhibitor treatment (Figure
S1H and 1E-F). PD0325901 was chosen because it had the highest potency of the drugs in
Figure S1A. Positive control shRNAs, targeting an essential gene (Rpa3), were strongly

depleted in both vehicle and drug-treated cells. Consistent with the importance of mutant
KRAS in cancer maintenance, shRNAs targeting KRAS were also depleted from the
population irrespective of drug treatment (Figure 1E-F). By contrast, CRAF-specific
shRNAs were depleted by over 6-fold after MEK inhibitor treatment (Figure 1F), but only
minimally after treatment with DMSO (Figure 1E and S1I). One of three BRAF specific
shRNAs was marginally depleted with PD0325901 whereas shRNAs targeting ARAF or
other RAS effectors were not selectively depleted after MEK inhibitor treatment (Figure
S1J). In an independent screen with an shRNA library enriched for known drug targets,
CRAF knockdown was again the most significant enhancer of MEK inhibition in KRAS
mutant cells (data not shown).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To confirm these findings, we tested a series of CRAF and BRAF specific shRNAs in this
pancreatic cancer model and in human KRAS mutant cancer cell lines. Four different CRAF
shRNAs that effectively decreased CRAF expression (Figure 1G) were not depleted when
used alone, but were selectively depleted in tumor cells exposed to PD0325901 (Figure 1H).
The two effective BRAF shRNAs tested were also depleted after PD0325901 treatment, but
to a lesser extent (Figure S1K-L). In human KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cells, CRAF
shRNAs were also depleted only after MEK inhibitor treatment (Figure S1M, S1N). In this
experiment, BRAF-specific shRNAs were also depleted, but to a lesser extent. Similar
results were observed following PD0325901 treatment of KRPC xenografts harboring a tetresponsive CRAF shRNA: when CRAF expression was knockdown in combination with
PD0325901, there was a significantly greater tumor regression than that observed when
PD0325901 was administered alone (Figure 1I). These results show that CRAF inhibition is
required for PD0325901 to be effective against KRAS mutant cancers, and suggest that
inhibitors like PD0325901 are less effective at inhibiting CRAF-activated MEK.
The rebound in ERK phosphorylation is dependent on CRAF

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To directly test whether RAF family members contribute to the rebound in ERK
phosphorylation observed after MEK inhibitor treatment we knocked down RAF in KRAS
mutant lung cancers. CRAF siRNAs decreased pMEK levels and attenuated the rebound in
ERK phosphorylation at 48 hours, whereas control siRNAs had no effect (Figure 2A and
S2A-B). Knockdown of BRAF had a small effect on the rebound in cells with mutant RAS
whereas knockdown of ARAF expression had no effect (Figure 2A). CRAF expression was
also required for the rebound observed in KRPC cells treated with PD0325901 (Figure
S2C). While these data do not exclude a potential role for wild type BRAF in mediating the
rebound in ERK phosphorylation in KRAS mutant cells, they suggest that CRAF is required
for the pERK rebound and are consistent with reports that CRAF is the main RAF isoform
responsible for driving ERK signaling in some RAS mutant tumors (Blasco et al., 2011;
Dumaz et al., 2006; Karreth et al., 2011).
The pERK rebound observed in KRAS mutant tumors was associated with induction of
pMEK (Figure 1C) and induction of CRAF phosphorylation at Ser 338 (Figure S2D). The
rebound in pMEK and pERK are not linearly related, probably because the level of ERK
phosphorylation is due to changes in MEK kinase activity and the activity and expression of
ERK phosphatases. Induction of MEK phosphorylation in cells exposed to MEK inhibitors

results from inhibition of ERK-dependent inhibitory phosphorylations of CRAF, with
attendant activation of CRAF kinase (Alessi et al., 1994; Dougherty et al., 2005). By
contrast, and in agreement with previous data (Pratilas et al., 2009), the level of MEK
phosphorylation decreased slightly after treatment in BRAFV600E tumors (Figure 1C). The
selective induction of MEK phosphorylation suggests that CRAF activation occurs
differentially in tumors with mutant RAS compared to those with mutant BRAFV600E.
In order to assay the induction of CRAF kinase activity, we performed in vitro kinase
reactions, with CRAF that was immunoprecipitated from cells treated with a MEK inhibitor
and a kinase-dead recombinant MEK1 as a substrate. In agreement with the conclusion
above, PD0325901 treatment increased CRAF activity over time in KRAS mutant models,
whereas only a small induction was noted in BRAFV600E cells (Figure 2B and Figure S2E).
Thus, compared to cells harboring BRAFV600E, KRAS mutant cells have more pronounced
reactivation of CRAF after inhibition of ERK signaling, which in turn mediates the rebound
in ERK phosphorylation.
MEK is less susceptible to inhibition when activated by CRAF than by BRAFV600E

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since RAS activation and CRAF activity are both low in BRAFV600E tumors, in which
MEK/ERK signaling is driven almost entirely by BRAFV600E (Wan et al., 2004), we
hypothesized that the decreased MEK inhibitor sensitivity of KRAS tumors is due to
ineffective inhibition of CRAF-driven MEK signaling by these drugs. To test this we
undertook two experimental approaches. In the first approach, mutant KRAS was coexpressed with either wild type (WT) CRAF or kinase-dead (KD, i.e. K375M) CRAF in
Craf-/- MEFs. As expected, one-hour treatment with PD0325901 inhibited ERK
phosphorylation in cells expressing the CRAFKD. In those expressing CRAFWT, however,
the pathway sensitivity to the drug was significantly reduced (Figure 2C). A similar effect
was observed when ERK signaling was driven by active NRAS (Figure 2C). These results
validate our CRAF knockdown findings and strengthen our conclusion that CRAF activation
reduces the efficacy of MEK inhibitor treatment.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the second approach, we developed a cellular system where ERK signaling could be
selectively switched from being driven by BRAFV600E to CRAF. To accomplish this, we
took advantage of the ability of RAF inhibitors to transactivate RAF dimers (Figure 3A). We
utilized the BRAFV600E cell line A375, where CRAF activity is low and MEK activation is
BRAFV600E-dependent (Lito et al., 2012; Pratilas et al., 2009). Vemurafenib treatment
inhibits BRAFV600E and ERK signaling in these cells. An N-terminal truncated CRAF
(catC) was expressed in A375 to form intracellular BRAFV600E-catC heterodimers. CatC
dimerizes in a RAS-independent manner and is transactivated by RAF inhibitor vemurafenib
(Poulikakos et al., 2010). CatC was engineered to harbor a gatekeeper mutation (T421M) in
order to prevent its binding to vemurafenib. Thus, when vemureafenib binds to and inhibits
BRAFV600E, it transactivates catCT421M in heterodimers, thereby triggering a switch from
BRAFV600E- to catC-dependent MEK activation (Figure 3A). A kinase-dead
catCT421M/K375M was used as a control. As shown in Figure 3B, expression of catCT421M
rendered ERK signaling insensitive to vemurafenib, since this drug does not inhibit RAF
dimers (lanes 1-4) whereas ERK signaling was sensitive to vemurafenib in cells expressing

catCT421M/K375M (compare lanes 7-8 to 3-4). The residual signaling in lanes 3 and 4 is
therefore due to transactivation of catCT421M by vemurafenib and represents activation of
CRAF kinase-dependent ERK signaling. Vemurafenib treatment induced similar effects
even when lower amounts of catC were expressed (Figure S3A-C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We then determined whether the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 could effectively inhibit
vemurafenib-induced catC-dependent ERK signaling (i.e. CRAF-dependent signaling). The
inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in response to the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 was
similar in BRAFV600E cells transfected with an empty vector or with catCT421M/K375M
(Figure 3C: rows 1-2), situations in which ERK phosphorylation is driven by BRAFV600E.
In contrast, expression of kinase active catCT421M attenuated the ability of PD0325901 to
inhibit ERK phosphorylation (Figure 3C: rows 3-6) in a manner that was proportional to the
level of catC expression (Figure 3D). Cells expressing low catC levels showed no change in
their sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in the absence of vemurafenib (Figure 3C: rows 3-4). In
these cells, however, vemurafenib treatment induced appreciable CRAF kinase signaling
(Figure S3B-C), and this was sufficient to reduce the sensitivity of pERK to PD0325901
(Figure 3C: rows 7 vs 3 or 8 vs 4 and Figure 3E). In cells in which catC expression was high
enough to drive CRAF kinase-dependent signaling in the absence of vemurafenib, the
effects of PD0325901 were attenuated regardless of whether the cells were treated with
vemurafenib (Figure 3C: rows 5-6 vs 9-10). These data show that ERK signaling activated
by CRAF is less sensitive to PD0325901 than when activated by BRAF V600E.
MEK inhibitors induce RAF-MEK complexes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In unpublished work we observed that some MEK inhibitors induce the association of MEK
with RAF. We hypothesized that MEK bound to an activated RAF kinase is less sensitive to
MEK inhibitors than is unbound MEK. We first evaluated if PD0325901 or selumetinib
induced RAF/MEK complexes in HEK293 cells engineered to express FLAG-MEK1.
Exposure of these cells to either drug increased the interaction of each RAF kinase with
FLAG-MEK1 (Figure 4A). We next tested whether induction of these complexes differed
between cells with mutant BRAF or mutant KRAS. Treatment of KRAS mutant A549 cells
with PD0325901 increased the association of endogenous MEK1 with all three RAF kinases
(Figure 4B and 4C). In contrast, the same treatment did not induce MEK-RAF complexes in
BRAFV600E A375 cells (Figure 4C). In this setting, PD0325901 reduced the level of MEK1
in complex with BRAF, as well as the level of MEK phosphorylation.
In order to confirm that the differences described above were related to the oncoprotein
responsible for activating ERK signaling, we repeated the experiments in HEK293 cells that
express FLAG-MEK1 and either KRASG12V or BRAFV600E. Induction of MEK1-RAF
complexes by PD0325901 was only observed when MEK1 was co-expressed with
KRASG12V (Figure S4A: lanes 1-2). In contrast, when MEK1 was co-expressed with
BRAFV600E there was a decrease in MEK1-RAF complexes after 3 hours of treatment
(Figure S4A: lanes 5-6). Similar findings were observed when KRAS or BRAF mutants
were co-expressed with MEK2 (Figure S4B). The data suggest that binding of MEK to
allosteric inhibitors cause MEK to bind to RAF in cells with mutant RAS, but not in those
with BRAFV600E.

The effect of MEK inhibitors is enhanced when RAF-MEK interactions are impaired

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

These findings suggest the possibility that MEK bound to an activated CRAF in tumors with
activated RAS is less sensitive to MEK inhibitors than is free MEK. We therefore tested
whether reducing the affinity of MEK for RAF would enhance its sensitivity to drugs in
cells with activated CRAF. The proline-rich region of MEK1 is thought to mediate its
interaction with RAF (Dang et al., 1998). Alanine substitutions of Met 308 and Ile 310
impair this interaction (McKay et al., 2009) and, in our experiments, produced a MEK1
mutant (impaired RAF interaction, IRI) that was defective in its ability to bind RAF kinases
(Figure 4D). We used the system illustrated in Figure 3 to test if altering the RAF-MEK
interaction affects the inhibition of CRAF-induced ERK signaling by these drugs. In cells in
which catC was co-expressed with FLAG-MEK1 there was residual pERK following
treatment with PD0325901, selumetinib or RDEA119 (Figure 4E). When catC was coexpressed with MEK1IRI instead, these drugs inhibited ERK phosphorylation more
effectively (Figure 4E and S4C-D). These findings suggest that MEK bound to activated
CRAF is less sensitive to inhibition by MEK inhibitors like PD0325901. Together, our data
support the conclusion that MEK inhibitors suppress ERK-dependent negative feedback to
activate CRAF and induce complex formation between MEK and CRAF. These, in turn,
cooperate to attenuate maximal pathway inhibition by these drugs in KRAS mutant tumors
(Figure 4F).
Trametinib and CH5126766 Inhibit ERK Signaling More Durably than PD0325901
Trametinib and CH5126766 are newer MEK inhibitors that have been reported to inhibit the
proliferation of selected RAS-mutant xenografts better than PD0325901 does (Gilmartin et
al., 2011; Ishii et al., 2013). On average, trametinib inhibited the proliferation of
BRAFV600E and KRAS mutant cancer cell lines with lower IC50s than PD0325901 or
selumetinib (Figure 5A and S5A), even though trametinib and PD0325901 had similar
potencies against MEK1 in vitro (Figure S5B). When compared to PD0325901, CH5126766
was less potent at inhibiting MEK1 kinase activity in vitro. CH5126766, inhibited the
proliferation of BRAFV600E and KRAS mutant cell lines at a similar IC50 range (Figure 5A),
although CH5126766 was still less effective against some KRAS mutant cells (Figure S5A:
H2030 and A549).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Increasing concentrations of PD0325901 did not reduce the rebound in ERK
phosphorylation occurring in KRAS mutant A549 cells at 48 hours (Figure 5B). In contrast,
the rebound associated with trametinib or CH5126766 decreased with increasing
concentrations of these drugs (Figure 5B). As these drugs have different potencies for
MEK1 in vitro (Figure S5B), we also evaluated the effects of each drug at concentrations 50
times higher than their IC50 for kinase inhibition in vitro. As compared to PD0325901,
treatment with trametinib or CH5126766 for 48 hrs at these concentrations resulted in more
sustained inhibition of pERK in KRAS-mutant cells (Figure S5C, H2030) and, also, in A375
cells expressing increasing amounts of active CRAF (Figure S5D).
If CRAF knockdown enhances the effect of MEK inhibitors by more durably inhibiting
ERK phosphorylation, then its effect should be minimized when combined with trametinib
(which inhibits ERK signaling better than PD0325901). To test this, we evaluated whether

cells expressing CRAF shRNAs were depleted when trametinib was administered at two
different doses, one associated with pERK rebound (4 nM), and a higher dose associated
with much less rebound (40 nM). As shown in Figure 5C, cells expressing CRAF shRNAs
were selectively depleted following treatment with 4 nM trametinib but not following
treatment with 40 nM trametinib. By contrast, a higher dose of PD0325901 did not affect the
selective depletion of cells expressing CRAF shRNA (Figure 5D). A similar effect was
observed with CH5126766 (data not shown). These data support our model that PD0325901
does not sufficiently inhibit CRAF-driven ERK signaling and that CRAF knockdown
enhances the effects of MEK inhibitors because the combination produces sustained ERK
inhibition.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

If the added benefit of trametinib occurs due to better inhibition of CRAF-driven signaling
than PD0325901 then the combination of PD0325901 with a CRAF inhibitor ought to yield
a similar response to that of trametinib alone. To test this, we used AZ628, which has been
characterized as an irreversible CRAF inhibitor, although it also targets other RAF kinases.
As shown in Figure 5E, treatment with PD0325901 or AZ628 alone did not cause significant
growth inhibition in KRAS mutant A549 cells. Combined PD0325901 and AZ628
treatment, however, was not only much more effective than either drug alone but also
produced a similar growth inhibition as observed with trametinib treatment alone (Figure
5E).
Trametinib decreases the interaction of MEK1 with RAF Kinases
We then asked whether the newer MEK inhibitors have a different effect on the formation of
RAF-MEK complexes or MEK phosphorylation. In contrast to PD0325901, trametinib did
not induce a significant interaction between MEK1 and RAF kinases in HEK293 cells,
regardless of whether MEK1 was expressed alone (Figure 6A), or co-expressed with mutant
KRAS or BRAFV600E (Figure S4A). Similar effects were observed when MEK2 was
expressed with KRAS or BRAF (Figure S4B). Moreover, trametinib treatment diminished
the ability of endogenous MEK1 to interact with RAF kinases in both BRAFV600E (Figure
6B) and KRAS mutant cells (Figure 6C). In KRAS mutant cells, this effect persisted up to
48 hr after drug treatment (Figure 6D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to determine if the change in complex formation
reflected a change in the affinity of MEK for RAF. Purified BRAF or CRAF were
immobilized on a sensor chip followed by sequential injections of increasing amounts of
MEK1. These experiments were performed in the presence of 500 μM ATP and before or
after addition of trametinib at a saturating concentration of 3 μM (Figure 6E). When bound
to trametinib, the dissociation constants for the interaction of MEK1 with either BRAF or
CRAF kinase were 0.101 μM and 0.107 μM, respectively. By comparison, the dissociation
constants for MEK1 unbound to drug were 0.055 μM and 0.038 μM, respectively. Thus,
trametinib is a MEK inhibitor that uniquely reduces the affinity of MEK from RAF, thereby
reducing steady state levels of RAF-MEK complexes. Trametinib inhibits the catalytic
activity of MEK by the same mechanism as PD0325901, yet it has the opposite effect on its
interaction with the RAF kinases. In contrast to the effect observed with PD0325901,
trametinib decreased the rebound in ERK phosphorylation in KRAS tumors cells (Figure

5B). This supports our above finding that CRAF-MEK complexes reduce the ability of
PD0325901-like inhibitors to inhibit ERK signaling.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CH5126766 prevents phosphorylation of MEK and induces RAF-MEK complexes
In contrast to trametinib, CH5126766 promoted the formation of RAF-MEK complexes
(Figure 6A-C and S4A-B). In addition, CH5126766 completely prevented the induction of
MEK phosphorylation in KRAS mutant tumor cells (Figure S6). These results are consistent
with our previous findings that CH5126766 blocks MEK phosphorylation, and that
CH5126766-bound MEK1 has a markedly slower dissociation from RAF kinases (Ishii et
al., 2013).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The ability of CH5126766 to prevent MEK phosphorylation, while inducing RAF-MEK
complexes, demonstrates another mechanism for effectively inhibiting ERK signaling in
KRAS mutant tumors. To investigate the structural basis for this mechanism we determined
the ternary complex of MEK1 bound to CH5126766 and an ATP analogue at a resolution of
2.7Å (Figure 7A and Table S1). CH5126766 interacts with a binding pocket defined by the
MEK1 activation segment, catalytic loop and ATP-binding site. MEK1 bound to
CH5126766 was in a catalytically inactive conformation, with an outwardly shifted αC
helix. CH5126766 formed a critical hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Ser 212, in a
similar manner as other MEK inhibitors, including PD03259021 (Figure S7A). This
hydrogen bond is critical for the binding of allosteric inhibitors to MEK (Ohren et al., 2004)
and thus represents a feature of this class of drugs.
The unique aspect of CH5126766 binding was its extension along the activation segment of
MEK1 (Figures 7A and 7B) and its interaction with Asn 221 and Ser 222 (Figure 7C), with
the latter interaction being coordinated by a water molecule. CH5126766-bound MEK1
displayed a lateral displacement of the activation segment, causing a minor and a major
repositioning of the RAF phosphorylation residues Ser 218 and Ser 222, respectively
(Figures 7B, C and S7B). This displacement was minimal in MEK1 bound to an enantiomer
of PD0325901 (Figures 7B, D and S7C). Thus, it is likely that CH5126766 prevents the
phosphorylation of MEK by binding to Ser 222, a key RAF phosphorylation site, and by
displacing the activation segment of MEK.

The MEK inhibitor CH4987655 is similar to CH5126766 in that it also interacts with Asn
221 and laterally displaces the activation segment of MEK (Figures 7B and 7E). Compared
to CH5126766, however, CH4987655 spans a shorter distance along the MEK activation
segment (Figure 7B) and does not interact with Ser 222 (Figures 7E vs 7C). With these
differences in mind, we tested the ability of CH4987655 to induce MEK phosphorylation
following MEK inhibitor treatment in KRAS mutant A549 cells. CH4987655 caused a very
minimal induction of pMEK, compared to standard MEK inhibitors like PD0325901. MEK
phosphorylation in CH4987655 treated cells, however, was much greater than that in
CH5126766 treated cells, suggesting that both lateral displacement of the activation segment
and Ser 222 binding are required for maximal inhibition of MEK phosphorylation by
allosteric compounds.

We then asked whether the increase in MEK-RAF complexes in cells treated with
CH5126766 is caused by dephosphorylation of MEK. A MEK1 mutant with
phosphomimetic glutamate substitutions at the RAF phosphorylation sites (i.e. S218E and
S222E or EE) was used to answer this question. As expected, CH5126766 treatment induced
the interaction of MEK1WT with BRAF and CRAF (Figure 7G). This induction was
abolished in cells expressing MEK1EE treated with CH5126766, which suggests that the
higher affinity of CH5126766-bound MEK1 from RAF kinases occurs because MEK bound
to this compound cannot be phosphorylated. Consequently, CH5126766 is more effective at
producing more sustained inhibition of ERK phosphorylation than PD0325901, despite
inducing RAF-MEK complexes.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Selective MEK inhibitors have marginal activity in patients whose tumors harbor KRAS
mutations. Our data suggest that reactivation of CRAF limits the ability of MEK inhibitors
to inhibit ERK signaling in KRAS mutant tumors. Knockdown of CRAF expression
enhanced the effects of MEK inhibitors on signaling and on the proliferation of KRAS
tumors. CRAF knockdown may enhance the antitumor effects of MEK inhibition by
inhibiting other targets of RAF in addition to MEK (Blasco et al., 2011). Several findings
presented here, however, suggest that MEK inhibitors do not effectively inhibit CRAFdriven ERK signaling: the rebound in ERK phosphorylation in mutant KRAS tumors
exposed to MEK inhibitors was driven by CRAF, and CRAF expression reduced the ability
of these drugs to inhibit ERK signaling. Furthermore, when the pathway was inhibited with
the stronger drug trametinib, enhancement by CRAF knockdown was minimal.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Activated ERK feedback inhibits the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in cells with activated RAS
by directly phosphorylating and inhibiting CRAF kinase activity (Dougherty et al., 2005).
MEK inhibitors relieve this feedback by inhibiting ERK and dephosphorylating and
reactivating CRAF. This causes induction of MEK phosphorylation in most tumor cells,
including those with mutant KRAS. (Alessi et al., 1994; Dougherty et al., 2005; Pratilas et
al., 2009). By contrast, RAS-GTP levels are very low in tumors with BRAFV600E (Lito et
al., 2012) and MEK inhibitors cause only marginal induction of CRAF kinase activity and
do not induce MEK phosphorylation in these cells. As inhibition of cellular ERK signaling
by PD0325901 varied inversely with the level of activated CRAF, it is likely that the
decreased effectiveness of MEK inhibitors in mutant KRAS cells is due to release of
feedback inhibition of CRAF kinase activity.
MEK inhibitors like PD0325901 and selumetinib also increase the association of MEK with
RAF kinases. This occurs in cells expressing mutant KRAS but not in those expressing
mutant BRAF. These data suggest that when MEK is bound to an activated CRAF, it is less
sensitive to MEK inhibitors than is unbound MEK. In support of this model, expression of a
MEK mutant that interacts more weakly with RAF resulted in better inhibition of CRAFdependent ERK signaling.
Near complete inhibition of ERK signaling is required for RAF inhibitors to cause tumor
regression in BRAFV600E tumors (Bollag et al., 2010). Such potent pathway inhibition is

unlikely to be achieved with PD0325901, solumetinib or other standard MEK inhibitors in
tumors driven by mutant KRAS. Our model suggests that ERK signaling in these tumors
may be more effectively inhibited by compounds that not only inhibit the catalytic activity
of MEK but also reduce its reactivation by CRAF. Indeed, we found two MEK inhibitors
that display this property and produce a more durable inhibition ERK signaling than
PD0325901. Trametinib and CH5126766 bind to a similar pocket in MEK as other MEK
inhibitors and inhibit its catalytic activity allosterically. These compounds, however, also
reduce the activation of MEK by RAF through two distinct mechanisms. Binding to
trametinib increases the dissociation rate of MEK from RAF and reduces the intracellular
level of RAF-MEK complexes. This reduces both the induction of MEK phosphorylation
and the rebound in ERK phosphorylation observed in KRAS mutant tumors. CH5126766
works by a different mechanism: it interacts with Ser 222 and Asn 221 on MEK and
prevents its phosphorylation by activated CRAF. Drug-bound, dephosphorylated MEK binds
more tightly to RAF and the level of MEK-RAF complexes is induced. However, because
CH512676-bound MEK cannot be phosphorylated and released from RAF, it becomes a
dominant negative inhibitor of RAF (Ishii et al., 2013).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Based on computational modeling, others have proposed that MEK inhibitors that prevent
MEK phosphorylation do so by interacting with Ser 212 (Hatzivassiliou et al., 2013).
However, this in-silico modeling was based on a crystal structure with a limited definition of
the carboxy terminal portion of the MEK activation segment, which does not include Asn
221 and Ser 222. Here we solved the ternary structure of CH512676-bound MEK1 and show
that CH5126766 forms multiple interactions with the activation segment of MEK, binding
not only to Ser 212 but also to Asn 221 and Ser 222 and displaces the activation segment of
MEK1. We believe that this is the likely mechanism by which it prevents the
phosphorylation of MEK by RAF.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our results demonstrate that the ability of MEK inhibitors to inhibit MAPK activity and
inhibit KRAS mutant cancer cells vary as a function of the specific biochemical properties
of the drug-bound MEK complex. Differences in cellular responses to these drugs reveal
subtleties in the biochemical regulation of the pathway, particularly the role of CRAF-MEK
complex formation in rendering KRAS mutant cancers less sensitive to these drugs. Rational
drug discovery relies on lead-optimization of compounds based on their selectivity, potency,
and pharmacologic properties. Understanding the exact mechanism of drug activity in the
appropriate signaling context is imperative in order to design more effective compounds.
Here we identify two biochemical properties that, if optimized, will improve the efficacy of
MEK inhibitors: increasing the dissociation rate of MEK from RAF and preventing MEK
phosphorylation by reactivated CRAF. If coupled with clinical trial designs aimed at
improving the therapeutic index of these drugs, e.g. pulsatile or intermittent dosing
schedules, these efforts are likely to maximize the clinical benefit of MEK inhibitors in
KRAS mutant tumors.

Experimental Procedures
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Compounds and cell culture
PD0325901 was synthesized in the MSKCC Organic Synthesis Core Facility by O.
Ouerfelli. Trametinib and CH5126766 were obtained from GlaxoSmithKline and Chugai
Pharmaceuticals, respectively. All compounds were diluted in DMSO for in vitro
experiments. Craf-/- MEFs were kindly provided by M. Baccarini; HEK293 were from
Invitrogen while BRAF and KRAS mutant cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection. Cell lines were maintained in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, glutamine and antibiotics.
Antibodies, immunoblotting and immunoprecipitations

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Antibodies detecting pMEK, pERK, pCRAF, MEK, ERK and CRAF were obtained from
Cell Signaling. V5 and FLAG antibodies were from Invitrogen and Sigma, respectively.
Immunoblotting was performed as described (Poulikakos et al., 2010). Exogenously
expressed FLAG-MEK1 was immunoprecipitated (IP) via a FLAG-specific antibody
agarose conjugate (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Endogenous
MEK1 was immunoprecipitated with MEK1 612B12 antibody (Cell signaling). In both
cases, IPs were carried out at 4° C overnight.
Immunoprecipitation kinase assays
These were performed as described (Poulikakos et al., 2010). Briefly, cells were lysed in
NP-40 lysis buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Roche). IPs were
carried out at 4° C for 4 hrs and immunoprecipitated CRAF was subjected to a kinase assay
with kinase dead MEK1 (Millipore). Kinase assays were conducted in the presence of 100
μM ATP at 30° C for 30 min. MEK phosphorylation was assayed by immunoblotting with
phospho-specific antibodies.
Plasmids and transfections

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MEK1, KRas and NRas encoding plasmids were obtained from Biomyx. CRAF or MEK
constructs harboring various mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis
(Agilent). DNA and siRNA transfections were carried out by using lipofectamine 2000 and
RNAiMAX reagents according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Animal Studies
Nu/nu athymic mice were obtained from the Harlan Laboratories and maintained in
compliance with IACUC guidelines. Subcutaneous xenografts and tumor measurements
were performed as described (Lito et al., 2012). All studies were performed in compliance
with institutional guidelines under an IACUC approved protocol (Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center No. 09-05-009).
Surface plasmon resonance
This was performed as described (Ishii et al., 2013). Briefly N- terminal GST-tagged BRAF
or CRAF was captured on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) by anti-GST

polyclonal antibodies that were pre-immobilized on the chip according to the manufacturer's
instructions. His6-MEK1 solutions at concentrations of 0.0256, 0.064, 0.16, 0.4, and 1
mmol/L, were injected sequentially in order of increasing concentration over the sensor chip
in the absence or presence of 3 mmol/L of the test compounds and then the dissociation
constants of His6-MEK1 were calculated for the immobilized RAF for each condition in the
presence of 500 μmol/L ATP. The effects of MEK inhibitors on the RAF-MEK1 complex
formation were determined by using single-cycle kinetics.
Crystallization and structural determination of MEK1-CH5126766 complex

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MEK1 kinase (residues 62-393, del 271-302) was expressed in E.coli with a His tag. The
expressed protein was purified using standard chromatography. Crystals were obtained at
4°C from sitting drops using a reservoir solution (7.5-10% PEG 8000, 0.2M NaCl, 0.2M
Ammonium sulfate, 0.1M citrate buffer, pH 4.2) by vapor diffusion. Diffraction data were
collected at 100 K at the SGX-CAT beamline in APX synchrotron using a Mar CCD
detector (Marresearch GmbH). The data set was processed with HKL2000 and scaled with
SCALA in the space group P3121. The structure of the MEK1 and CH5126766 complex
was determined by molecular replacement. The crystals contain one monomer of the protein
in the asymmetric unit. The model was rebuilt manually in COOT, and refined with CNX
2005 (Accelrys Inc.) to a final resolution of 2.7 Å. B-factors were refined isotropically. The
final model consisted of residues 62-380 with 2 breaks (residues 79-81, 268-307 were
disordered). The resulting electron density revealed an unambiguous binding mode of
CH5126766. For crystallographic data and refinement statistics, see Table S1. This structure
has been deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession number 3WIG.
Pooled negative selection screening

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A miR30-based shRNA library containing 193 shRNAs targeting 70 genes encoding for
various components of the Ras effector pathway was assembled. All hairpins included in
this set were the top scoring candidates in a FACS based high-throughput reporter assay that
functionally evaluates shRNA potency and thus leads to the identification of highly potent
shRNAs (Fellmann et al., 2011). The hairpin pool was subcloned into TRMPV-Neo (Zuber
et al., 2011) and combined with positive- and negative control shRNAs. Viral supernatant
from triplicate transfections into PlatE cells was harvested and used to transduce Tet-on
KRPC cells under conditions that led to single integrations (less that 5% initial infection
rate). Triplicates were processed separately throughout the screen and at all times care was
taken to maintain an shRNA representation exceeding 1000× per replicate.
Successfully transduced cells underwent G418 selection (Invitrogen, final concentration
500μg/ml) for 7 days. At this time, T0 samples were obtained for genomic DNA extraction
and the remaining cells were cultured in doxycycline containing media (final concentration
1μg/ml) to induce shRNA expression. At 48 hr after dox treatment, cells of each triplicate
were further propagated in doxycycline containing media in the presence of 40 nM
PD0325901 or DMSO for the duration of the screen. On the final day of the screen (Tf),
approximately 2 million cells per replicate and condition were FACS sorted (Venus+, dsRed
+) and genomic DNA was extracted from all samples using the Gentra Puregene Cell kit
(QIAGEN, Venlo, Netherlands). Deep-sequencing template libraries were generated for

each replicate by PCR amplification of shRNA guide strands. To allow for multiplexed
illumina sequencing, forward primers located in the loop region of the miR30 cassette were
barcoded 3′ of the p7 adapter sequence (forward primer: 5′CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA - 8nt barcode - TAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTA -3′).
The p5-adapter-coupled reverse primer was placed 3′ of the miR30 shRNA cassette within
the TRMPV-Neo backbone to achieve exclusive amplification of shRNAs that were part of
the library and avoid amplification of the miR30 based p53 hairpin present in the screen cell
line (reverse primer: 5′ - AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACGGTAG
AATTGCTAGAATTG - 3′). All PCR reactions per barcode were pooled and subjected to
Agencourt AMPure XP bead purification (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Pasadena, CA). Libraries
were analyzed on an Illumina 2000 Genome Analyzer (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using the
custom primer miR30EcoRISeq 5′ - TAGCCCCTTGAATTCCAGG CAGTAGGCA - 3′.
Sequence processing was performed using a custom script developed by the MSKCC
Bioinformatics Core and downstream analysis was performed in R (http://cran.rproject.org/) and the fold change of shRNA representation was calculated by comparing
normalized shRNA reads at Tf to normalized reads at T0. To identify synthetically lethal
interactions, fold change in the presence of the MEK inhibitor was set in relation to the fold
change in the absence of the MEK inhibitor.

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We show that the effects of MEK inhibitors in KRAS mutant tumors vary, owing to
specific properties of drug-bound MEK. In these tumors, some MEK inhibitors induce
CRAF-MEK complex formation, which prevents durable inhibition of ERK. Newer
compounds associate with MEK differently and are affected less by reactivated CRAF.
Through genetic, pharmacological, and structural approaches we identified two allosteric
effects that improve the efficacy of MEK inhibitors in KRAS mutant tumors: increasing
the dissociation of MEK from RAF or causing MEK to adapt a conformation in which it
cannot be phosphorylated by RAF. Designing more effective compounds for treating
cancer requires understanding the mechanism of drug action in the appropriate genetic
context.

Figure 1. KRAS mutant tumors are less sensitive to allosteric MEK inhibitors than BRAFV600E
tumors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) BRAFV600E and KRAS-mutant tumor cell lines were treated with increasing doses of
PD0325901 for three days to determine the effect on proliferation. A representative example
of three independent experiments (each performed in triplicate) is shown as means +/- SEM.
(B-D) The indicated tumor cell lines were treated with increasing amounts of PD0325901
for three hours (B) or with 50 nM of PD0325901 for the indicated times (C). Lysates were
assayed by immunoblotting to determine the level of MEK and ERK phosphorylation. The
bands were quantified by densitometry and the pERK level after treatment was normalized
to the pretreatment pERK level (D). A representative example of three independent
experiments for each cell line is shown.
(E, F) Fold change in shRNA abundance in DMSO-treated (E) or PD0325901 (F)-treated
cells. Note the selective depletion in shRNAs targeting CRAF with PD0325901 treatment.
shRNAs targeting Rpa3 or KRAS were used as positive controls, whereas those targeting
luciferase or renilla were used as negative controls. Bars represent the mean fold change
from an experiment performed in triplicate.
(G) KRPC cells were transduced with the indicated CRAF shRNAs and lysates were
subjected to immunoblotting to determine the knockdown in CRAF expression.
(H) KRPC cells infected with four different CRAF shRNAs were treated with dox to induce
CRAF knockdown and PD0325901 (+MEK inhibitor) or DMSO (-MEK inhibitor) for the
indicated times. The data were normalized to the shRNA abundance in cells after 48 hr of
treatment with dox.
(I) KRPC cells were stably infected with the indicated dox-inducible CRAF shRNA
followed by implantation in athymic mice. The mice were treated with MEK inhibitor
PD0325901 in the presence or absence of dox. The effect of CRAF knockdown (+dox) in
the ability of the MEK inhibitor to inhibit KRAS tumor growth is represented as mean +/SEM (n=6)

Figure 2. CRAF expression attenuates the effects of MEK inhibition in KRAS-mutant tumors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells (A549) were transfected with siRNA pools targeting
each of the RAF isoforms and then treated with 50 nM of PD0325901 for 48 hr. Whole cell
lysates were evaluated by immunoblotting to determine the effect on ERK signaling. A
representative example of three independent experiments for each siRNA is shown.
(B) The indicated cell lines were treated with 50 nM of PD0325901 as shown. CRAF was
immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates and subjected to a kinase assay using an
inactive MEK1 (K97R, KD) as the substrate. CRAF activity was determined by
immunubloting with a phospho-MEK antibody. A representative example of two or more
independent experiments for each cell line is shown.
(C) Craf-/- MEFs were co-transfected with the indicated constructs and then treated with
PD0325901 for 1 hr. Lysates were analyzed by immunobloting to determine ERK
phosphorylation. A representative example of two independent experiments for each RAS
isoform is shown. WT: wild type; KD: kinase dead

Figure 3. MEK is less susceptible to inhibition when activated by CRAF than BRAF V600E

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) A schematic representation of the experimental system used. BRAFV600E mutant A375
cells have low levels of CRAF activity at baseline and MEK activation is dependent on
BRAF kinase. Treatment with RAF or MEK inhibitors inhibits ERK signaling in these cells.
We relied on the ability of RAF inhibitors to transactivate RAF dimers in order to switch
from BRAFV600E-dependent to catC-dependent signaling. To this end, catC was expressed
to form BRAFV600E-catC heterodimers in A375 cells. A gatekeeper mutation in catC
(T421M) prevents RAF inhibitor binding. Thus, the RAF inhibitor vemurafenib binds to and
inhibits BRAFV600E while transactivating catC in heterodimers. A kinase-dead catC
(T421M/K375M) was used as a control.
(B) A375 cells expressing the indicated constructs were treated with increasing doses of
vemurafenib for 1 hr and whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with the
indicated antibodies.
(C) A375 cells were transfected with increasing amounts of plasmid encoding catCT421M. In
the indicated rows RAF inhibitor pre-treatment (vemurafenib, 1μM, 1 hr) was used to
transactivate catC in heterodimers, and switch from BRAFV600E- to catC-driven signaling.
Following transfection and pretreatment as shown, the cells were treated with increasing
doses of PD0325901 for 1 hr to determine its ability to inhibit ERK phosphorylation. A
representative example of at least two independent experiments for each condition is shown.
(D, E) The bands in C were quantified by densitometry and normalized to the level of pERK
prior to PD0325901 treatment.
