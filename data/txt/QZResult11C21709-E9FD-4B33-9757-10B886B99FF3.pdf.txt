ABSTRACT
The presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood predicts poor patient
outcome and CTC frequency is correlated with higher risk of metastasis. Recently
discovered, novel microtubule-based structures, microtentacles, can enhance
reattachment of CTCs to the vasculature. Microtentacles are highly dynamic membrane
protrusions formed in detached cells and occur when physical forces generated by
the outwardly expanding microtubules overcome the contractile force of the actin
cortex. Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) is a major regulator of actomyosin contractility
and Rho/ROCK over-activation is implicated in tumor metastasis. ROCK inhibitors
are gaining popularity as potential cancer therapeutics based on their success in
reducing adherent tumor cell migration and invasion. However, the effect of ROCK
inhibition on detached cells in circulation is largely unknown. In this study, we use
breast tumor cells in suspension to mimic detached CTCs and show that destabilizing
the actin cortex through ROCK inhibition in suspended cells promotes the formation
of microtentacles and enhances reattachment of cells from suspension. Conversely,
increasing actomyosin contraction by Rho over-activation reduces microtentacle
frequency and reattachment. Although ROCK inhibitors may be effective in reducing
adherent tumor cell behavior, our results indicate that they could inadvertently
increase metastatic potential of non-adherent CTCs by increasing their reattachment
efficacy.

INTRODUCTION

downstream effector ROCK [5] have been reported in a
number of cancers, including breast [6], bladder [7] and
brain cancer [8]. Moreover, the Rho/ROCK pathway has
been implicated in tumor cell migration and invasion via
its roles in tail retraction of migrating cells, focal adhesion
turnover and invadopodia formation [7, 9].
Growth factor binding and/or integrin clustering
activates Rho and ROCK resulting in increased cellular
contraction and actin filament stabilization through
a series of downstream phosphorylation events [4].
ROCK, a serine/threonine protein kinase, regulates
contraction by activating non-muscle myosin II,
through direct phosphorylation of myosin II [10] as

Cytoskeletal rearrangements within tumor cells
play important roles during cancer metastasis, which is
the leading cause of patient mortality [1]. In addition
to the reorganization of the cytoskeleton enabling once
stationary, adherent tumor cells to migrate and invade
[2], cell deformability is necessary for the survival of
disseminated tumor cells that enter circulation [3]. The
Rho family of small GTPases are critical mediators of
tumor cell plasticity and regulate the cytoskeleton resulting
in changes in cell morphology, polarity and migration [4].

well as by phosphorylating and inactivating the myosin
dephosphorylating enzyme, myosin phosphatase [11].
Increased bundling of actin by myosin as a result of
Rho/ROCK activation leads to cellular contraction and
formation of actomyosin stress fibers in the cytosol that
terminate at the plasma membrane in focal adhesions
[11]. ROCK further stabilizes actin filaments by
inactivating the actin severing protein, cofilin [12].
In addition to modulating the actin cortex, the Rho/
ROCK signaling pathway has bifurcating roles in the
regulation of microtubule stability [13]. While activation
of Rho GTPase can increase stable detyrosinated
microtubules through its downstream effector mDia
[14], it can also destabilize microtubules through ROCK
mediated inactivation of tubulin-stabilizing protein
tau [15] and inhibition of tubulin stabilizing posttranslational modification acetylation [16]. Furthermore,
the microtubule cytoskeleton can in turn regulate Rho
signaling since depolymerization of microtubules
releases the microtubule-bound RhoGEF-H1, resulting
in an increase in Rho-mediated stress fiber formation and
actomyosin contractility [17, 18].
A number of recent studies using cancer cell-lines
and mouse metastasis models have shown that inhibition
of ROCK activity has been effective in reducing tumor
progression [9, 19-21], which has generated significant
interest in using ROCK inhibitors as cancer therapies.
However, the effect of these drugs on detached and
disseminated tumor cells that are in circulation is largely
unknown. The presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
in blood is associated with decreased disease-free and
overall survival in patients with primary as well as
metastatic disease [22, 23]. Hematogenous dissemination
of tumor cells can occur even before the primary tumor
is detected and surgical resection of tumors can increase
CTCs 1000-fold [24, 25]. Although anoikis or blood flow
shear forces usually destroy epithelial cells that enter
circulation, homotypic and heterotypic cell aggregations
promote CTC survival and extravasation that can lead to
metastatic outgrowth [3].
Given that previous studies measuring the efficacy
of ROCK inhibitors as a chemotherapeutic have focused
only on cells that are attached to the extra-cellular matrix,
we wanted to investigate the effects of ROCK inhibition
in tumor cells that are detached and free-floating in
order to mimic disseminated tumor cells in circulation.
We found inhibiting ROCK activity in suspended breast
cancer cells increased the formation of microtubule-based
structures, termed microtentacles (McTNs). McTNs
are highly dynamic membrane protrusions formed in
cells detached from the extra-cellular matrix [26] and
occur when physical forces generated by the outwardly
expanding microtubules overcome the inward contractile
force of the actin cortex [27]. Previously published studies
from our laboratory have shown that McTNs promote
CTC aggregation [26], reattachment to the endothelium
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[28] and CTC lung retention [29, 30] in mice. This
study demonstrates that ROCK inhibition results in
a destabilized actin cortex that is unable to resist the
formation of McTNs. The increase in McTNs corresponds
with an increased reattachment efficacy of suspended
breast tumor cells in vitro. Conversely, over-activating
the Rho/ROCK pathway results in a more contractile and
stabilized actin cortex resulting in a decrease in McTNs
and in vitro reattachment. These findings indicate that
inhibiting ROCK activity can give disseminated breast
tumor cells a reattachment advantage by increasing the
formation of McTNs.

RESULTS
Inhibiting ROCK activity decreases actomyosin
interaction in adherent and suspended cells
The Rho/ROCK signaling pathway is required for
actomyosin crosslinking and inhibition of ROCK activity
decreases cellular contraction [31]. In order to assess the
effects of inhibiting ROCK in metastatic breast cancer
cell lines, BT549 and Hs578T, the cells were treated with
the compound Y-27632, an ATP competitive inhibitor
of ROCK activity [32]. Stress fibers are actin filament
bundles cross-linked by myosin that require active ROCK
for their formation and thus serve as a downstream
indicator of ROCK activity. To visualize stress fibers, the
cells were stained with phalloidin, a filamentous actin
binding dye. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that
vehicle-treated BT549 cells displayed thick actin stress
fibers in the cell center as well as the cell periphery (Figure
1A-Vehicle). Treatment with 10Î¼M Y-27632 for one hour
resulted in a complete loss of stress fibers throughout
the cell body confirming ROCK inhibition (Figure 1AY-27632). Since ROCK regulates the actin cytoskeleton
through phosphorylation of its downstream substrates, to
determine the efficacy of ROCK inhibition we analyzed
protein phosphorylation levels in the Y-27632 treated
cells. Myosin II is a motor protein that forms a closed
compact molecule due to head to tail interactions (known
as the assembly incompetent form) [33]. ROCK-mediated
phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin
(MLC) at serine-19 unfolds myosin into an assemblycompetent conformation that is capable of binding
actin. ROCK further regulates myosin phosphorylation
by inactivating myosin phosphatase (MLCP) through
phosphorylation of its myosin-binding subunit (MYPT1)
at threonine-853, which prevents MLCP from binding to
myosin [11]. Western blot analysis showed that Y-27632
treatment decreased the levels of phosphorylated MLC as
well as phosphorylated MYPT1, while the total levels of
both proteins were comparable to those in vehicle-treated
cells (Figure 1B). This decrease in the assembly competent

form of myosin indicates decreased actin binding and
bundling activity. Additionally ROCK can stabilize the
actin cortex by phosphorylating and inactivating cofilin
[12]. Y-27632 treatment decreased phosphorylated
cofilin in both cell lines while total protein levels of
cofilin remained the same, indicating there is more
dephosphorylated (active) cofilin that can destabilize actin
filaments upon ROCK inhibition (Figure 1B).
We wanted to analyze if the results of ROCK
inhibition seen in adherent cell conditions could be
extended to cells that are detached. Our rationale was that
disseminated cancer cells in circulation do not experience
cell-cell or cell-ECM contacts and to predict the effect of
ROCK inhibition in these cells, we have to mimic the freefloating microenvironment of CTCs. In order to achieve
this, BT549 and Hs578T cells were suspended in lowattach plates in full-serum containing media and treated
with 10Î¼M Y-27632 for one hour. Western blot analysis
showed similar decreases in levels of phosphorylated
cofilin, myosin and myosin phosphatase as observed in
adherent cell conditions, indicating that cells in suspension
also have decreased actomyosin interaction and cortical
stabilization when treated with Y-27632 (Figure 1B).
Densitometric analysis of 3 independent experiments
confirmed the statistical significance and consistency of
these results (Figure 1C). Cell viability studies confirmed
that the observed results were not confounded by drug
related cytotoxicity (Supplementary Figure 1A&B)

assembly-competent form that can crosslink and bundle
actin filaments (Figure 2B).
To determine the effect of Rho pathway overactivation on free-floating detached cells, the cells
were serum starved for 24 hours and plated in ultralow attachment plates and treated with 4Î¼g/ml Rho
Activator II for 3 hours. As observed in the adherent
cell conditions, Rho Activator II treatment similarly
increased phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1 proteins
in suspended cells (Figure 2B). ROCK promotes actin
stabilization by phosphorylation and inactivation of
cofilin, thereby preventing actin filament severing [12].
Unexpectedly, Rho Activator II treatment did not show
an increase in the phosphorylation status of cofilin in
adherent or suspended conditions, indicating that Rho
over-activation does not result in a significant change in
cofilin phosphorylation. However, under these conditions
the cells already have high levels of phosphorylated
(inactive) cofilin that cannot destabilize actin. Perhaps the
cofilin inactivation is saturated and the cells are incapable
of further phosphorylating this protein. Densitometric
analysis of 3 independent experiments confirmed the
statistical significance and consistency of these results
(Figure 2C). The increased stress fiber formation,
phosphorylation of myosin and myosin phosphatase
indicates that 4ug/ml Rho Activator II effectively overactivates the Rho pathway resulting in increased actinmyosin crosslinking and bundling that could lead to a
stabilized actin cortex in adherent and suspended cells.
There was no significant reduction in cell viability
or increased PARP cleavage observed with the Rho
Activator II dose used for this study, ruling out drugrelated cytotoxicity as a result of ROCK over-activation
(Supplementary Figure 2A&B)

Over-activation of Rho signaling pathway
increases actomyosin interaction in adherent and
suspended cells
To determine if over-activating the Rho/ROCK
pathway would increase actomyosin cross-linking, a
Rho pathway activator (Rho Activator II) was used. Rho
Activator II deamidates glutamine-63 of Rho, which
prevents GTP hydrolysis and keeps Rho in its active
GTP-bound state [34]. Since serum in media used to
culture cells contains Rho activating components [35],
BT549 and Hs578T cells were serum starved for 24 hours
prior to drug treatment to obtain baseline values for Rho
activity. Immunofluorescence analysis of the vehicletreated BT549 cells stained with phalloidin showed a
lack of stress fibers due to low endogenous Rho/ROCK
activity as a result of serum starvation (Figure 2A-Vehicle)
Serum starved BT549 cells treated with 4Î¼g/ml Rho
Activator II for 3 hours displayed thick stress fibers
throughout the cell body (Figure 2A-Rho Activator II). In
corroboration with the increased stress fibers observed by
immunofluorescence, protein analysis of cells treated with
Rho Activator II showed increased phosphorylated myosin
as well as phosphorylated inactive myosin phosphatase
compared to vehicle control treated cells, suggesting
that in the Rho Activator II-treated cells myosin is in its

Modulating Rho/ROCK activity regulates the
formation of microtentacles
We have previously published that modulation of
the polymerization dynamics of the actin cortex can make
cells more susceptible to the formation of McTNs [36].
Additionally, altering the activity of actin-destabilizing
proteins such as cofilin can also effect McTN formation
[37]. Given that Y-27632 treatment can decrease cellular
contraction [31] we tested the effects of modulating
ROCK activity on McTN formation. To determine if
destabilization of the actin cortex as a result of ROCK
pathway inhibition would increase McTN formation,
BT549 and Hs578T cells were treated with 10Î¼M
Y-27632 for one hour, then detached and stained with a
cell membrane binding dye for 10-15 min in an ultra-low
attachment plate. After being blinded to the treatment
groups, 100 cells from each group were scored for the
presence of McTNs, with cells showing protrusions longer
than the radius of the cell being considered positive.

There was a significant increase in the percentage of cells
that scored positive for McTNs in the Y-27632 treated
group compared to those treated with vehicle control
(Figure 3A & 3B). As an additional control, the cells
were also treated with the microtubule-depolymerizing
drug colchicine. 50Î¼M colchicine treatment for an hour
dramatically reduced the frequency of McTNs compared
to vehicle-treated cells but did not completely abolish
McTN formation (Figure 3A). In order to ensure that the
increased protrusions observed in the Y-27632 treated
cells were microtubule-based; cells were treated with
50Î¼M colchicine in addition to 10Î¼M Y-27632. Colchicine
significantly reduced the McTNs that were promoted by
Y-27632, indicating that intact microtubule polymers
are required for the formation of McTNs in the ROCK
inhibitor treated cells (Figure 3A). Colchicine treatment
did not completely block McTNs, so Y-27632 could still
induce a relative increase by disrupting the actin cortical
barrier, and allowing any residual microtubules to extend
into McTNs.
Since a decrease in actin cortical integrity resulted
in an increase in McTNs, and given the ability of Rho/
ROCK to increase cellular contraction [31], we wanted
to test whether Rho pathway over-activation could affect
McTN formation. According to the cellular tensegrity
model, compressional forces applied by the actin cortex
result in buckling and breaking of microtubules when
they encounter the cortical barrier [38]. BT549 and
Hs578T cells were serum starved for 24 hours and then
treated with 4Î¼g/ml Rho Activator II and scored for
McTN positivity. Both cell lines showed a significant
decrease in the percentage of cells that scored positive
for McTNs suggesting that increased cortical stability can
inhibit the formation of McTNs (Figure 3C). Confocal
live-cell images of suspended BT549 cells stained with a
fluorescent cell membrane dye show McTNs on multiple
cells in the Y-27632 treated group compared to the vehicletreated group (Figure 3B). In contrast, Rho Activator II
treatment decreases the number of cells presenting McTNs
compared to the vehicle-control treated cells (Figure 3D).

by increasing tau phosphorylation, thereby preventing
tau from binding and stabilizing microtubule filaments
[15]. Although an increase in acetylated tubulin and a
decrease in phosphorylated tau after Y-27632 treatment
has been previously reported, we did not observe any
significant change in acetylation of alpha-tubulin or tau
phosphorylation upon ROCK inhibition in the breast
cancer cells tested in adherent or suspended conditions
(Figure 4A&B). Immunofluorescence analysis of Y-27632
treated BT549 cells showed a slight shift in the distribution
of acetylated tubulin, but also overall changes in cell shape
given the drugâs effect on actin (Figure 4C), so it remains
possible that the reorganization of acetylated tubulin
merely reflects the change in cell morphology rather
than any tubulin-specific reorganization. While ROCK
works to destabilize microtubules, a different downstream
effector of the Rho pathway, mDia increases microtubule
stability by forming a complex that caps microtubule plus
ends and promotes the formation of stable detyrosinated
microtubules (also known as glu-microtubules) [39].
Since Y-27632 selectively targets the Rho effector
ROCK but not mDia, we had predicted an increase in
detyrosinated tubulin after Y-27632 treatment. However,
densitometric analysis of 3 independent blots did not show
a significant change in detyrosination of alpha-tubulin in
adherent or suspended cells (Figure 4A&B). Additionally,
immunofluorescence analysis did not show any significant
changes in the localization or distribution of detyrosinated
tubulin in the Y-27632 treated cells (Figure 4C). These
results indicate that in the cell lines tested, inhibiting
ROCK does not increase microtubule stability, suggesting
that increased McTNs observed upon ROCK inhibition do
not arise from increased microtubule stabilization.

Inhibiting ROCK
reattachment

cell

We have previously demonstrated that cells with
higher McTN frequencies can reattach from suspension
more efficiently than cells with lower McTN frequencies
[40] and we wanted to determine whether Y-27632
treatment could similarly affect cell reattachment.
The xCELLigence Real Time Cell Analyzer was used
to assess the functional role of increased McTNs in
the ROCK inhibitor treated cells. Using this device,
reattachment is measured as impedance to the flow of a
low-voltage electric current as cells reattach to the plate
from suspension. BT549 cells that were treated with
10Î¼M Y-27632 for one hour reattached more efficiently
following detachment as compared to vehicle-treated
cells (Figure 5A). When the cells were pre-treated with
the microtubule-depolymerizing drug colchicine, the
cells reattached significantly less than the vehicle-treated
cells, indicating microtubules are essential for initial
reattachment. In fact, addition of colchicine to the Y-27632

ROCK inhibition does not increase McTNs
through microtubule stabilization
Apart from modulating the actin cytoskeleton,
the Rho/ROCK pathway can also regulate microtubule
stability through post-translational modifications such
as acetylation, detyrosination and tau phosphorylation
[13, 15, 16]. Given our previous data that microtubule
stabilization can result in increased McTN frequency
[26], ROCK-regulated markers of tubulin stability
were analyzed to investigate the role of microtubule
stabilization in McTN formation in the Y-27632
treated cells. ROCK has been reported to destabilize
microtubules by decreasing tubulin acetylation [16] and

treated cells abolished the faster reattachment frequencies
observed with Y-27632 treatment alone indicating that
microtubule disruption by colchicine prevents increased
reattachment even in cells with destabilized actin cortex.
The same trend was observed in the Hs578T cell line
(Figure 5B). To visualize the reattachment, phase-contrast
images of cells were taken at corresponding time-points.
More cells had attached to the plate in the Y-27632 treated
group at earlier time-points compared to vehicle-control
group (Figure 5C&D and Supplementary Figure 3A&B)

in cells that are detached and free-floating, they have not
been previously reported in studies that have primarily
focused on the effects of ROCK inhibitors in adherent
cells. In vivo studies with colon carcinoma cells has
demonstrated a microtubule-based mechanism for the
reattachment of circulating cells to the capillary walls that
is further enhanced by actin depolymerization [45]. This
corresponds with previously published studies from our
laboratory which have shown that altering the cytoskeleton
with actin-destabilizing drugs or microtubule-stabilizing
drugs results in an increase in the formation of McTNs in
detached cells and enhances their reattachment [27, 30,
36].
In the present report, we show that in attached
cells, destabilizing actin cortical integrity with the ROCK
inhibitor, Y-27632, relaxes the cortex and makes the cells
more elongated in appearance. The effects of Y-27632
on cell-shape deformation is enhanced in detached cells
that do not experience any external cell-cell or cellECM contact resistance to cell shape deformation. In
these cells, destabilizing actin filaments and reducing
actomyosin contraction with Y-27632 abolishes the inward
compressional force applied by the actin cortex. Without
a barrier to buckle and break the outwardly-pushing
microtubules, these cells show a significant increase in
the formation of McTNs. Further proof of the concept that
microtubule outgrowth is antagonized by actin cortex is
the reduction in the frequency of McTNs observed in cells
treated with the Rho activator, Rho Activator II. Although
detachment usually induces formation of McTNs in cells,
increasing actomyosin cross-linking and contractility
counteracts this effect in the suspended Rho activated
cells.
The Rho/ROCK signaling pathway also regulates
the microtubule cytoskeleton and Y-27632 treatment
has been reported to increase microtubule stability [16,
46]. However we did not observe consistent changes in
markers of tubulin stability such as tau phosphorylation, or
changes in alpha-tubulin post-translational modifications
such as detyrosination or acetylation. While it is possible
that the duration of treatment or concentration used was
not sufficient to cause the organizational changes in the
breast cancer cells used, our results suggests that the
increase in McTNs observed with Y-27632 treatment is
largely due to its effect of destabilizing the actin cortex,
rather than a result of microtubule stabilization
Disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow and
circulating tumor cells in the blood are rapidly emerging
as markers that can predict patient clinical outcome [23]
and there are currently a number of interventional clinical
trials underway to investigate the benefits of using CTCs
as a prognostic marker to determine treatment options
[47]. Most current and developing chemotherapeutics
focus on reduction in cell proliferation, migration and
invasion to determine drug efficacy and thus fail to address
the effects of these drugs on free-floating cells that are

Rho pathway over-activation decreases cell
reattachment
The actin cortical network applies a compressional
force on the cell and this tension is resisted by
microtubules, so that increased cortical tension prevents
microtubules from pushing outwards [38]. We established
that 4Âµg/ml Rho Activator II treatment promotes changes
in the actin cytoskeleton and decreases McTN frequency.
To assess the effect of reduced McTNs in Rho overactivated cells on reattachment efficiency, BT549 and
Hs578T cells were serum starved for 24 hours and then
treated with either vehicle or 4Î¼g/ml Rho Activator II for
3 hours, detached and their reattachment was measured
in real-time. The Rho Activator II treated cells showed a
significant decrease in reattachment compared to vehicletreated cells (Figure 6A&B). Phase-contrast images of the
cells show that the control cells began the reattachment
process by 1 hour and have almost completely attached
by 3 hours while most of the Rho Activator II treated cells
remain rounded even at 3 hours and very few reattach to
the plate at the experimental endpoint (Figure 6C&D).
These results confirm that modulation of the actin
cortex through Rho activation can significantly decrease
suspended cell reattachment.

DISCUSSION
Cell migration and invasion are steps that are
critical for metastasis and rely on Rho/ROCK-mediated
cytoskeletal modifications and actomyosin contraction
[41]. The ability of ROCK inhibitors to reduce the
migratory and invasive properties of adherent tumor cells
has led to suggestions that they could possibly be used to
reduce metastasis in cancer patients and combined with the
clinical success of ROCK inhibitors in other pathological
conditions with deregulated actomyosin contraction
such as cardiovascular diseases [42], hypertension [43]
and atherosclerosis [44], ROCK inhibitors are gaining
popularity as safe compounds that could be easily
transitioned to cancer therapy.
However, in this study we show that ROCK
inhibition increases the formation of microtentacles in
detached breast tumor cells. As McTNs are only observed

in circulation. ROCK inhibitors have been reported as
efficacious anti-cancer agents based on studies done in
attached cell conditions, but our study shows that they
could promote reattachment of circulating tumor cells by
increasing McTN formation in detached cells. A number
of studies in the last decade have shown a positive
correlation between high CTC levels and metastatic
disease [22] highlighting the importance of targeting
CTCs. Nevertheless, many current clinical regimens
using traditional chemotherapeutics may fail to eradicate
CTCs, which are often quiescent and thus are resistant
to chemotherapeutics that target cell division [48]. Even
newer targeted tumor-specific small-molecule inhibitors
or antibody therapies may be ineffective on CTCs if
the CTCs are molecularly different from the primary
tumor cells as a result of newly acquired mutations or
selective dissemination of clonally heterogeneous tumor
cells [23]. For example, microtubule-targeting cytotoxic
chemotherapies such as taxanes, which are extremely
effective in their anti-proliferative effects on the primary
tumor, can significantly increase CTCs in the patientsâ
blood when given prior to surgery [49]. Accumulating
evidence on the role of CTCs in promoting metastasis
[22-24] highlights the necessity of screening developing
chemotherapeutics for their effects on free-floating
suspended cells in addition to adherent cell conditions to
avoid inadvertently increasing CTCs and metastatic risk.
Recently a number of studies have found EMT and
stem cell markers in CTCs and these cells have been found
to have higher metastatic efficiency [50]. Interestingly, a
number of recent studies have shown that use of Y-27632
in routine culture promotes survival and proliferation of
dissociated human embryonic stem cells by preventing
dissociation-induced apoptosis [51-53]. Moreover,
organizational changes in the actin cytoskeleton and
inhibition of actomyosin contractility regulate stem cell
fate of human keratinocyte stem cells by preventing clonal
conversion [54]. Intriguingly, inhibition of actomyosin
contractility promotes induction of stem-like phenotype
in primary cancer cell lines [55]. Liu et al show that this
phenomenon is not due to selective survival of rare stemlike cells present in the population but rather a result of
conditional reprogramming of cells and use a combination
of Y-27632 and feeder cells to indefinitely proliferate
cultures generated from as few as 4 tumor cells [56].
The applications of inhibition of contractility in stem cell
generation and proliferation is important for diagnostic
and regenerative medicine. But at the same time, it also
calls to attention the possible implications of using ROCK
inhibitors as cancer therapeutics if they promote survival
and possibly conversion of detached tumor cells towards a
stem-like phenotype. We have recently reported that breast
cancer cell lines with higher stem-like characteristics
have increased McTNs that promote their reattachment
from suspension [57]. These findings indicate that
chemotherapeutics that inadvertently promote such
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stem-like characteristics might be detrimental to overall
progression-free survival.
Disseminated tumor cells in circulation are predicted
to be precursors of distant metastasis and therefore,
new drugs that are being developed as potential cancer
therapeutics need to be examined for their effect on CTCs.
The biggest challenge CTC research faces is that CTCs
are present at very low numbers in the blood; on the order
of 1 CTC per 108 blood cells, making it very difficult to
both detect CTCs and obtain large enough numbers to test
for drug efficacy. While the low number of recoverable
viable CTCs prevents many functional studies, one
alternative is to mimic the microenvironment of CTCs,
which should at least include free-floating cell conditions
when testing drug effects. The vast majority of studies
evaluating the efficacy of ROCK inhibitors as cancer
therapeutic focus on adherent cell behavior and have
failed to address their effect on disseminated tumor cells
that are in circulation. In this study we show that ROCK
inhibition in detached cells can increase McTN formation
and in vitro reattachment efficiency. Since ROCK
inhibitors might prove useful in reducing primary tumor
dissemination because of their anti-migratory and antiinvasive effects, in order to maximize their anti-cancer
efficacy, it might be prudent to use ROCK inhibitors in
conjunction with microtubule targeting drugs to reduce
McTNs [40] and thereby prevent inadvertently increasing
metastatic risk. Our results emphasize the importance of
considering the current attachment state of circulating
tumor cells in patients, so that targeting ROCK to reduce
the migration and invasion of adherent tumor cells does
not inadvertently increase the metastatic potential of nonadherent circulating tumor cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
BT549 and Hs578T cells were cultured in DMEM
(Corning Cellgro) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%
Penicillin/Streptomycin and maintained at 37Â°C in 5%
CO2. Y-27632 and Rho Activator II (CN03) were obtained
from Cytoskeleton, Inc. The Rho Activator II drug
concentration used for this study was determined based
on the dose at which maximum stress fiber formation
was observed, as recommended by the manufacturer.
Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting and/or
immunofluorescence were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology for P-MYPT1 (T853), Total-MYPT1, P-MLC
(S19), Total-MLC, P-cofilin (S3), Total-cofilin and Acetyl
(L-40) tubulin; Abcam for P-tau (S262) and detyrosinatedtubulin; and alpha-tubulin was obtained from Sigma.

appropriate drug treatments, cells were trypsinized and
the detached cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1000
rpm, 5min). Cell pellet was resuspended in phenolred free DMEM containing 1:2500 CellMask orange
(Invitrogen) and incubated for 10-15 min at 37Â°C and 5%
CO2 in ultra-low attachment plates. After being blinded
to the treatment groups, 100 cells were scored from each
group for the presence of McTNs, with cells showing
protrusions longer than the cell radius being counted as
positive. Each treatment group was scored in triplicate
and 3 such independent trials were conducted to generate
mean and SD of McTN counts (total of 900 cells for each
treatment group). Statistical significance was verified
using the studentâs t-test. To generate the McTN images
used in the manuscript, the CellMask stained live cells
were imaged using the Olympus FV1000 laser scanning
confocal microscope. Stacked images were converted to
maximum intensity projection using ImageJ.

For fixed cell imaging, cells were plated on glass
coverslips placed in a 24-well dish. After appropriate drug
treatments, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde
(10min), permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in
PBS solution (10min) and blocked with 5% BSA/0.5%
NP-40 in PBS (1hour). Cells were incubated overnight
at 4Â°C with primary antibodies (1:500 dilutions) in
2.5%BSA/0.5%NP-40 in PBS solution. Cells were
subsequently washed with PBS and incubated with
corresponding anti-Mouse or anti-Rabbit Alexa-Flour
488 or 568 conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000
dilutions) and Hoechst 33342 (1:5000; Invitrogen) in PBS
for an hour at room temperature. To visualize filamentous
actin, cells were stained with phalloidin Alexa-Fluor
488 (1:500; Molecular Probes) in PBS for an hour at
room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and the
coverslips were mounted on microscope slides. Images
were taken using the Olympus FV1000 laser scanning
confocal microscope.

Attachment assay
Cells were treated for an hour with either vehicle;
10ÂµM Y-27632; 50ÂµM colchicine or a combination of
10ÂµM Y-27632 and 50ÂµM colchicine. Prior to treatment
with the Rho activator, the cells were serum-starved for
24 hours and then treated with either vehicle or 4Âµg/ml
Rho Activator II for 3 hours. Following appropriate drug
treatments, cells were trypsinized and counted. 2x104 cells
were plated in triplicate into the RTCA xCELLigence
microwell E-plates (ACEA Biosciences). The microwell
plates used for this assay have electrodes that can measure
the change in the flow of low-voltage electric current
passing through the plate. As cells attach to the plate
there is resistance to the flow of current and this change
in impedance is a direct measure of number of cells
that have adhered. After adding the cells, the plate was
placed in the RTCA DP Analyzer located in an incubator
maintained at 37Â°C and 5% CO2. Cell reattachment to the
plate was measured as perturbation to the flow of current
passing through the E-plate and a reading was taken
every 5 minutes for 3 hours. The change in impedance to
the flow of current over time was used to determine the
reattachment efficiency of the cells. Each treatment group
was run in triplicate and the graph represents the mean +/SD. Three such independent trials were conducted.

Immunoblotting
Cells were treated with appropriate drugs (10ÂµM
Y-27632 for 1 hour; 4Âµg/ml Rho Activator II for 3 hours)
and whole-cell lysates were harvested using 4x laemmli
buffer. The lysates were passed through a 25 gauge syringe
10 times and then boiled at 95Â°C for 7-8 minutes. Protein
concentrations were quantified using DC protein assay
(Biorad) and lysates were diluted with water to a 2x buffer
concentration prior to loading. DTT (final concentration
0.1mM) and 1ul of 0.4% bromophenol blue were added
to the lysates and 20Î¼g of the lysates were run on 4% to
12% NuPage MES Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen) and
transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.
The blots were blocked with 5% milk or 5% BSA (for
the phospho-antibodies) for an hour and probed with
primary antibodies (1:1000) overnight at 4Â°C. The blots
were subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxide
(HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000, Jackson
ImmunoResearch) for an hour. Densitometric analysis
of 3 independent experiments was done using ImageJ
software and statistical significance was computed using
the studentâs t-test.

Cell viability

McTN scoring and imaging

Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter 96Â®
AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega)
as per manufacturer instructions. Briefly, 2x104 cells
were plated in triplicate in a 96well plate and allowed to
adhere for 24 hours. For Rho activator treatment, cells
were incubated in serum-free media for 24 hours prior to
drug treatment to mimic experimental conditions followed

BT549 and Hs578T cells were treated for an hour
with either vehicle; 10ÂµM Y-27632; 50ÂµM colchicine or
a combination of 10ÂµM Y-27632 and 50ÂµM colchicine.
Prior to treatment with the Rho activator, cells were
serum-starved for 24 hours and then treated with either
vehicle or 4Âµg/ml Rho Activator II for 3 hours. After

appropriate drugs and then incubated with the CellTiter
reagent for 2 hours at 37Â°C and 5% CO2. Absorbance was
measured at 490nm and values obtained were averaged
and normalized over vehicle-control. 3 such independent
trials were conducted to obtain mean +/- SD.
