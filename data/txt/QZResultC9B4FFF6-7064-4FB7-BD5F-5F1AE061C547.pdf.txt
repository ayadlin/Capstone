Abstract

Author Manuscript

While cancers grow in their hosts and evade host immunity through immunoediting and
immunosuppression1–5, tumors are rarely transmissible between individuals. Much like
transplanted allogeneic organs, allogeneic tumors are reliably rejected by host T cells, even when
the tumor and host share the same major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles, the most
potent determinants of transplant rejection6–10. How such tumor-eradicating immunity is initiated
remains unknown, though elucidating this process could provide a roadmap for inducing similar
responses against naturally arising tumors. We found that allogeneic tumor rejection is initiated by
naturally occurring tumor-binding IgG antibodies, which enable dendritic cells (DC) to internalize
tumor antigens and subsequently activate tumor-reactive T cells. We exploited this mechanism to
successfully treat autologous and autochthonous tumors. Either systemic administration of DC
loaded with allogeneic IgG (alloIgG)-coated tumor cells or intratumoral injection of alloIgG in
combination with DC stimuli induced potent T cell mediated anti-tumor immune responses,
resulting in tumor eradication in mouse models of melanoma, pancreas, lung and breast cancer.
Moreover, this strategy led to eradication of distant tumors and metastases, as well as the injected
primary tumors. To assess the clinical relevance of these findings, we studied antibodies and cells
from patients with lung cancer. T cells from these patients responded vigorously to autologous

tumor antigens after culture with alloIgG-loaded DC, recapitulating our findings in mice. These
results reveal that tumor-binding alloIgG can induce powerful anti-tumor immunity that can be
exploited for cancer immunotherapy.

Author Manuscript

To study the basis of allogeneic tumor rejection, we examined the immune response to
tumors in MHC-matched allogeneic mice (illustrated in Fig. 1a). B16 melanoma cells
expanded continuously in syngeneic C57Bl/6 hosts yet spontaneously regressed in
allogeneic 129S1 hosts (Fig. 1b). Conversely, LMP pancreatic tumor cells, isolated from
KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre mice11, grew steadily in 129S1 mice but
spontaneously regressed in C57Bl/6 animals (Fig. 1b). Depletion of NK cells did not prevent
tumor rejection (Extended Data 1a). In contrast, depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells prior to
allogeneic tumor inoculation prevented tumor regression (Fig. 1b). T cell proliferation and
tumor infiltration began by week 1 (Fig. 1c, Extended Data 1b). Additionally, allogeneic
tumors contained more mature myeloid DC (mDC, Ly6C−/CD11b+/CD11c+/MHCII+/
CD64dim) and fewer SSClow/CD11bhi/Ly6Chi/MHCII− myeloid cells than syngeneic tumors
(Fig. 1d, Extended Data 1c). Even at day 3, mDC in allogeneic tumors expressed higher
levels of MHCII, CD86 and CD40 compared to mDC in syngeneic tumors, reflecting
activation (Extended Data 1d). Allogeneic mDC internalized more tumor cell-derived
molecules from CFSE-labeled LMP cells (Fig. 1e). However, co-culture of DC with
allogeneic tumor cells induced negligible activation or tumor antigen uptake (Fig. 1f,
Extended Data 1e), demonstrating that additional factors contribute to DC activation in vivo.

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, IgM and IgG antibodies were bound to allogeneic, but not syngeneic, tumor
cells within 24 hours following tumor inoculation (Fig. 1g–i), before T cells appeared (Fig.
1c). Moreover, allogeneic antibodies bound tumor cells more effectively than syngeneic
antibodies (Extended Data 2a), including syngeneic antibodies from tumor-bearing mice
(Extended Data 2b). To assess the potential role of antibodies in tumor rejection, B cells
were depleted before mice were challenged with allogeneic tumors (Extended Data 2c).
Antibody depletion accelerated tumor development and delayed or prevented tumor rejection
(Fig. 1j). Moreover, adoptive transfer of allogeneic IgG, but not IgM, enabled rejection of
syngeneic tumors (Fig. 1k, Extended Data 2d). This effect was abrogated in Fcγ receptor
(FcγR)-deficient mice (Fig. 1k).

Author Manuscript

To investigate the effect of antibodies on tumor uptake by DC, we incubated tumor cells or
lysates with syngeneic or allogeneic antibodies to form immune complexes (IC) and added
these to bone marrow-derived (BM) DC (Fig. 2a). Only IC from allogeneic IgG (alloIgG-IC)
or IgM (alloIgM-IC) induced BMDC activation and uptake of tumor-derived proteins (Fig.
2b–d), which were found in proximity to MHCII molecules (Fig. 2e). BMDC activated by
alloIgG-IC induced significant T cell proliferation (Fig. 2f), demonstrating that tumor
antigens were processed and presented.
To determine whether IC-bound DC could elicit anti-tumor immune responses in syngeneic
hosts, B16 or LMP cells were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.), and tumors were removed
upon reaching 25–55mm2, leaving tumor-free margins. IgG-IC or IgM-IC were prepared
from excised tumors and incubated with syngeneic BMDC, which were injected into the
corresponding tumor-resected mouse (Fig. 2g). While nearly all mice treated with syngeneic

BMDC loaded with alloIgG-IC remained tumor-free for over a year, all other animals
experienced rapid tumor relapse (Fig. 2h). This response was completely abrogated in DC
lacking FcγR (Extended Data 3a–c). Furthermore, adoptive transfer of T cells from alloIgGIC-treated animals protected naïve mice from tumor challenge (Extended Data 3d–e).

Author Manuscript

Despite these findings, only minor effects were observed when alloIgG was injected into
tumors in autologous hosts (Fig. 3a). To address this discrepancy, we obtained tumorassociated DC (TADC) (Extended Data 4a) and cultured them with tumor lysates or alloIgGIC. In contrast to BMDC, TADC displayed no activation (Fig. 3b–d, Extended Data 4b) and
their transfer to tumor-resected mice had no effect on recurrence (Fig. 3e). Accordingly, p38,
ERK1/2 and JNK were phosphorylated in BMDC but not TADC activated with alloIgG-IC
(Fig. 3f). We then tested the effect of additional MAPK stimuli on the response of TADC to
alloIgG-IC. PolyI:C, TNFα+CD40L or IFNγ+CD40L enabled activation of TADC and
alloIgG-IC uptake (Fig. 3g, Extended Data 4c–d). We subsequently tested whether alloIgG
in combination with one of these stimuli could induce immune responses to syngeneic
tumors in situ. Intratumoral injection of alloIgG combined with TNFα+CD40L or polyI:C
induced complete elimination of B16 and LL/2 tumors (Fig. 4a, Extended Data 5a–c).

Author Manuscript

Under these conditions, only mDC (CD11b+/Ly6C−/CD11c+/MHCII+/CD64dim) and cDC
(CD11b−/CD11chi/MHCII+) markedly increased their IgG binding during an effective antitumor immune response (Fig. 4b, Extended Data 5d). Moreover, tumor-infiltrating DC
exhibited significant activation (Fig. 4c) and accumulation in the draining lymph nodes
(Extended Data 5e). Adoptive transfer of TADC from treated mice into naïve mice conferred
complete protection against B16 (Fig. 4d). In contrast, transfer of macrophages had a modest
protective effect, while B cells, NK cells and mast cells provided no benefit (Extended Data
5f–g).

Author Manuscript

To test whether alloIgG bears unique modifications that mediate an immune response, we
covalently crosslinked syngeneic IgG (synIgG) onto B16 membrane proteins. These IC still
conferred a therapeutic benefit after incubation with BMDC (Extended Data 6a),
demonstrating that binding of IgG to the tumor cell surface, rather than the origin of the IgG,
was critical. To investigate whether the tumor-binding antibody targets are related to the
anti-tumor T cell specificities, we resected B16 tumor cells and formed IC using an antibody
against MHC-I, against which there could not be reactive T cells. DC loaded with these IC
protected animals from B16 recurrence without inducing autoimmunity, suggesting that
tumor-reactive T cell specificity is not determined by the antibody targets (Extended Data
6b). Furthermore, B16-bearing mice treated with alloIgG+αCD40+TNFα were protected
from re-challenge with B16 melanoma, but not syngeneic RMA lymphoma, suggesting that
the tumor-reactive T cells recognize tumor-associated antigens rather than widely expressed
allo-antigens (Extended Data 6c).
Vaccination with BMDC loaded with IC containing B16 proteins derived from the cell
membrane, but not other subcellular fractions, prevented tumor relapse, and B16 protein
denaturation, but not deglycosylation, removed the therapeutic benefit (Extended Data 6d).
Pre-absorbing alloIgG against normal cells syngeneic to the tumor also removed the
therapeutic benefit (Extended Data 6e). AlloIgG from germ-free mice induced tumor

immunity (Extended Data 6f), suggesting that IgG against microbiota were not required.
Therefore, the protective effect of alloIgG is dependent upon antibody binding to membrane
proteins expressed on normal cells.

Author Manuscript

We therefore identified B16 membrane proteins specifically bound by alloIgG using mass
spectrometry. While synIgG bound six cell membrane proteins, all at approximately equal or
lower levels than alloIgG, alloIgG preferentially bound 16 cell membrane proteins, many
containing strain-specific polymorphisms (Extended Data Table 1). To functionally validate
these hits, we focused on Transmembrane-Glycoprotein NMB (GP-NMB). Antibodies
against GP-NMB bound B16 cells at much higher levels than normal cells and enabled DC
activation, and alloIgG bound GP-NMB at higher levels than synIgG (Extended Data 7a–c).
Treatment using anti-GP-NMB+αCD40+TNFα induced significant FcγR-dependent tumor
regression (Extended Data 7d–e). Treated tumors exhibited striking leukocyte infiltration,
including activated effector/memory T cells, compared to untreated tumors (Extended Data
8a–b). Whereas all treatments elicited gp100-reactive CD8+ T cells, only alloIgG
+αCD40+TNFα elicited Trp2-reactive CD8+ T cells (Extended Data 8c). Adoptive transfer
of CD4 or CD8 T cells from these mice protected naïve mice from B16 challenge, and
depletion of either CD4 or CD8 T cells prior to treatment prevented tumor regression
(Extended Data 8d–e). These findings confirm that alloIgG induces T cell reactivity against
tumor-associated antigens distinct from those bound by the antibodies.

We next treated a genetically-engineered melanoma model driven by BrafV600E and loss of
Pten12 with alloIgG+αCD40+TNFα. Treated mice experienced complete responses lasting
over 8 weeks in the injected tumors and distant sites (Fig. 4e). To assess the effect of this
combination on metastases, orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors were treated after all mice had
palpable tumor-draining lymph nodes, indicative of tumor spread. Only treatment with
alloIgG+αCD40+TNFα led to almost complete resolution of metastases and primary
tumors, and the few remaining micrometastases were heavily infiltrated with leukocytes
(Fig. 4f–g, Extended Data 9a).
We next compared the capacity of IgG from cancer patients and healthy allogeneic donors to
bind the patients’ tumors. Most but not all donors had antibodies with higher tumor-binding
capacity (Extended Data 9b). We tested if alloIgG+CD40L+TNFα could induce tumor
uptake and maturation of human TADC from two patients with lung carcinoma. Addition of
CD40L+TNFα enabled these DC to internalize alloIgG-IC and induced DC activation (Fig.
4h,Extended Data 9c–d). Moreover, BMDC from 2 patients with malignant pleural
mesothelioma incubated with alloIgG-IC, but not autologous IgG-IC, exhibited activation
and drove autologous CD4+ T cell proliferation (Fig. 4i).

The effect of naturally arising tumor-reactive antibodies on tumor progression has been a
source of controversy. Some studies suggest that such antibodies promote tumor
progression13–19, while others report that they can stimulate anti-tumor immunity20–28. Like
the antibodies that develop in cancer patients, commercial immunoglobulin preparations,
which likely contain tumor-binding alloantibodies, have shown limited benefit when used to
treat cancer29,30. Our data may provide a mechanistic explanation for these findings, as they
show that while TADC are not naturally responsive to IgG-IC, addition of specific stimuli

enables them to drive tumor-eradicating immunity. Hence, the role tumor-binding antibodies
play in tumor immunity depends upon the environmental context and the cell types involved.
Here we demonstrate that tumor-antigen presentation following antibody-mediated uptake
by DC is sufficient to initiate protective T cell-mediated immunity against tumors. Our work
suggests that this fundamental mechanism of immunological recognition and targeting,
which prevents tumor transmission even between MHC-matched individuals, can be
exploited as a powerful therapeutic strategy for cancer.

BM mononuclear cells were negatively selected using a murine monocyte enrichment kit
(Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver Canada), and FSClo/SSClo/Ly6Chi/CD115hi/MHCIIneg
cells were sorted with a FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). Monocytes were cultured for 4–5
days in the presence of 50 ng/mL GM-CSF (PeproTech) to generate DC. For TADC, tumors
were digested in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS, Gibco) containing 4 mg/mL
collagenase IV and 0.01 mg/mL DNase I (Sigma). Cells were applied on a Ficoll gradient
and magnetically enriched using CD11b+ selection kits (StemCells) and Ly6C−/CD11c+/
MHCII+ cells were sorted by FACS. In some experiments TADC were activated with
1µg/mL bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 1µg/mL high molecular weight polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid (polyI:C) (both from InvivoGen, San Diego, CA), or with 50 ng/mL
TNFα or 50 ng/mL IFNγ (PeproTech) in combination with 500 ng/mL CD40L, OX-40

Tumor cells, TADC, peripheral blood T cells and IgG were obtained from 2 patients
undergoing resection surgery for stage I lung carcinoma. Tumors were enzymatically
digested with 0.1mg/mL of DNase I and 5mg/mL collagenase IV (Sigma) in HBSS for 30
min. Tumor cells were enriched by sorting CD45-negative cells, fixed in 2%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed extensively in PBS and coated for 30 min with
autologous IgG or pooled allogeneic IgG obtained from healthy blood donors. To obtain
TADC, FSClow/SSClow/CD11c+/MHCIIhi cells were sorted and maintained for 1h in 10%
FCS IMDM at 37°C. For FACS and confocal studies, tumor DC were incubated overnight
with autologous tumor cells coated with selfIgG or alloIgG alone, or in the presence of 5

In separate experiments, 10 cm long rib bones and 10 mL blood were obtained from 2
patients undergoing resection surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma. To generate
BMDC, bones were flushed with PBS and mononuclear cells were separated on Ficoll
gradients. CD34+ cells were then enriched using magnetic beads (Miltenyi) and cultured for
9–12 days in IMDM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 ng/mL human GM-CSF and
20 ng/mL human IL-4 (PeproTech). To obtain autologous tumor cells, tumors were
enzymatically digested with 0.1mg/mL of DNase I and 5mg/mL collagenase IV (Sigma) in
HBSS for 30 min. Tumor cells were enriched by sorting CD45-negative cells, fixed in 2%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed extensively in PBS and coated for 30 min with
autologous or pooled allogeneic IgG. Autologous CD4+ T cells were enriched from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells on magnetic beads (Miltenyi) and IgG was isolated from
each patient’s plasma using protein A columns (GE Healthcare). For T cell proliferation
assays, 2×104 DC were incubated overnight with antibody-coated tumor cells as above,
washed and co-cultured with 2×105 autologous CD4+-enriched T cells. After 6 days, cells
were pulsed with 3H-thymidine (1 µCi/well) and cultured for an additional 18h before being
harvested in a Harvester 400 (Tomtec). Radioactivity was measured by a 1450 MicroBeta
counter (LKB Wallac). T cell proliferation was assayed in 6 technical replicates per sample.
The human subjects protocols were approved by Stanford’s Institutional Review Board, and
informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

For cell surface staining, monoclonal antibodies conjugated to FITC, PE, PE-Cy7, PECy5.5, APC-Cy7, eFluor 650, or Pacific Blue and specific for the following antigens were
used: CD11b (M1/70), F4/80 (BM8), B220 (RA3-6B2) from BioLegend (San Diego, CA)
and CD115 (AFS98), CD80 (16-10A1), I-Ab (AF6–120.1), CD40 (1C10), Ly6C (HK1.4),
CD86 (GL1) from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). All in vivo experiments to characterize
tumor-infiltrating leukocytes were independently repeated at least 3 times with 3–5 mice per
group. iTAg APC-labeled H-2Kb-Trp-2(SVYDFFVWL) and iTAg PE-labeled H-2Dbgp100(EGSRNQDWL) tetramers were purchased from MBL international (Woburn, MA) and
were used according to manufacturer’s instructions. Tetramer-staining experiments were
repeated twice with 5 mice in each group. For protein phosphorylation-specific flow
cytometry, cells were activated for 5, 15 or 30 min with or without IC and fixed for 15 min

incubated with 95% methanol at 4°C for 20 min. Conjugated antibodies against phosphop38 (Thr180/Tyr182), and phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) were purchased from Cell
Signaling and phospho-ERK1/2 (p44) (pT202/pY204) from BD Biosciences. DC protein
phosphorylation experiments were repeated 5 times, each with biological duplicates. For
tumor-binding IgM and IgG, PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (RMM-1), anti-mouse IgG
(Poli4052) and anti-human IgG (HP6017) were purchased from BioLegend. Flow cytometry
was performed on a LSRII (BD Biosciences) and datasets were analyzed using FlowJo
software (Tree Star, Inc.). In vivo binding levels were tested in 4 independent experiments,
3–5 mice in each group.
Intracellular IFNγ staining

Author Manuscript

B16 tumors from treated mice were digested to obtain a single cell suspension. A total of
2×106 cells per well were cultured for 4 hours in 10% FCS RPMI containing 1× Brefeldin A
(eBioscience) in a 96 well plate containing 4×104 BMDC loaded with 10 µg of B16
membrane proteins. Cells were washed and stained for extracellular T cell markers. Cells
were then fixed and permeabilized using cytofix/cytoperm solutions (BD Bioscience) and
stained with PE-Cy7 conjugated anti-IFNγ antibody (XMG1.2, BioLegend). Experiments
were repeated twice independently with 5 mice per group.
Cytokine measurements

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded at 1×106 cells/mL and cultured for 12 h with or without tumor immune
complexes, or LPS (Sigma). TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-12 (p40/p70) in the supernatants were
measured by ELISA, according to manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN). Cytokine secretion was measured in biological triplicates in 4 independent
experiments.
IgG and IgM purification and measurement
Mouse antibodies were obtained from pooled 5 mL 20–24-week-old mouse serum by liquid
chromatography on AKTA Explorer/100Air (GE Healthcare). Total mouse IgG and IgM
were purified using protein-G and 2-mercaptopyridine columns, respectively (GE
Healthcare). The levels of purified IgG and IgM were measured with specific ELISA kits
(Bethyl, Montgomery, TX) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The capacity of
purified antibodies to bind tumor cells was tested by flow cytometry prior to their use in
vivo. 1 µg IgG per 1×105 allogeneic tumor cells bound at least 8 times higher compared to
isotype control antibodies. Serum levels of antibodies were measured in biological triplicates
in 4 independent experiments.

Necrotic and apoptotic tumor cell internalization experiments
For necrotic tumor cells, cultured LMP or B16 cell were trypsinized, washed and
resuspended at a concentration of 5×106 cells/mL in cold PBS (GIBCO). Cells were then
subjected to three cycles of freeze-thaw between liquid nitrogen and a 37°C water bath and
the level of necrotic cells was determined by Trypan blue under light microscopy. Apoptotic

purchased from Life Technologies and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
DC activations with above cells were repeated 4 independent times in biological duplicates.

Absorption of alloIgG on normal cells

When obtained from surgical resections, tumor cells were initially isolated after enzymatic
digestion and sorted as FSChi/CD45neg cells prior to their fixation and staining. For tumorantibody complexes, tumor cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, washed extensively
and incubated with 1–3 µg syngeneic or allogeneic IgG or IgM per 1×105 tumor cells, and
were then washed to remove excess antibodies. To obtain tumor lysate Ig-IC, tumor cells
were incubated for 30 min on ice with 1–3 µg syngeneic or allogeneic IgG or IgM per 1×105
tumor cells, washed from excess antibodies and further disrupted with non-denaturing lysis
buffer (Pierce) to obtain Ig-IC. DC activations with the above Ig-IC were repeated in at least
10 independent experiments in biological duplicates.

Skin and pancreas were removed from naïve C57Bl/6 or 129S1 mice and enzymatically
digested with 0.1 mg/mL of DNase I (Sigma) and 4 mg/mL collagenase IV (Sigma) in PBS
to obtain single cell suspensions. Splenocytes were isolated by mashing spleens through 70
µm cell strainers. Cells were then mixed at 1:1:1 ratio and extensively washed and incubated
with 0.5 µg/1×106 cells FcγR block (BD) and 5% (W/V) BSA (Sigma) in PBS for 15 min on
ice. Cells were then washed and incubated with alloIgG (2 µg per 1×106 cells) for 30 min on
ice. Cells were centrifuged at 5,000 RPM for 10 min, and the supernatants were
concentrated by 50 kDa centrifugal filters (Amicon) before being incubated with 1×105
tumor cells.
Membrane protein extraction

Author Manuscript

For native membrane protein extraction, B16F10 cells were scraped in cold PBS and
pelleted at 400×g for 5 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was washed twice in cold PBS,
resuspended in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were pelleted
and the buffer was removed. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL of SEAT buffer (10
mM triethanolamine/acetic acid, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 250 mM sucrose, protease inhibitor
cocktail) and homogenized with twenty strokes of a dounce homogenizer. The sample was
spun at 900×g for 6 min to collect the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS). The PNS was spun at
100,000×g for 60 min at 4°C to harvest a membrane pellet, which was then resuspended in 4
mL membrane extraction buffer (MEB) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH-8.0, 150 mM NaCl,
1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mM NaF, and protease inhibitor cocktail. After
incubation for 2 h at 4°C, the membrane extract was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000×g
for 30 min at 4°C. For denatured membrane protein extraction, the membrane pellet was
resuspended in 500 µl Radio-Immuno-Precipitation Assay buffer (RIPA, Sigma) and lysed
with a 25G needle syringe. Lysates were incubated at 4°C for 1h and spun at 100,000×g,
30min, 4°C. Supernatant containing detergent solubilized membrane proteins was collected
and boiled for 5min at 95°C. Deglycosylation of membrane proteins was performed using a
commercial kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturer’s

running pattern of precipitated proteins was compared on SDS-PAGE.
Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry

Author Manuscript

Immunoprecipitation was set up with 20 mg membrane extract and 50 µg of syngeneic or
allogeneic IgG coupled to protein G magnetic beads and incubated for 16 hr at 4°C. Beads
were washed thrice with MEB and bound protein complexes were eluted with 2X Laemmli
buffer. The eluted sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel followed by
GelCode Blue staining (Thermo Scientific) to visualize protein bands. Protein bands were
excised, digested with trypsin and analyzed (MS Bioworks) using a nano LC/MS/MS with a
NanoAcquity HPLC system (Waters) interfaced to a Q Exactive (Thermo Fisher). The mass
spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, with MS and MS/MS performed in the
Orbitrap at 70,000 FWHM and 17,500 FWHM resolution, respectively. The fifteen most
abundant ions were selected for MS/MS. The data were processed with the Mascot Server
(Matrix Science). Mascot DAT files were parsed into the Scaffold software for validation,
filtering and to create a non-redundant list per sample. Data were filtered at 1% protein and
peptide FDR, requiring at least two unique peptides per protein. Mass spectrometry analysis
of precipitated proteins was performed once.

1% Trypan blue and 50 mM pH 7.0 Tris-HCl) and 62.5 and 125 ng/well was run for 2 hours
in Novex® NativePAGE™ Bis-Tris gel system (Life Technologies) on ice. Bands were
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated overnight with 10µg/mL mouse IgG,
or with 1µg/mL rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-mouse GP-NMB (cat. no. S-24 sc-133634, Santa
Cruz). The membranes were washed, incubated for 45min with goat anti-mouse IgG light
chain-specific antibodies conjugated to HRP (Pierce), developed with SuperSignal West
Femto Substrate (Pierce), and exposed together for imaging.
For FACS staining of GP-NMB on tumor cells, 1x105 B16 or LMP cells were incubated
with 2µg rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse GP-NMB (Santa Cruz) for 30 min, washed twice and
incubated for 20 min with PE-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies,
respectively (both from eBioscience). FACS measurements were repeated 3 independent
times in biological duplicates.
In vivo tumor models

Author Manuscript

For tumor challenge studies, 2x105 and 5×104 LMP or B16 tumor cells, respectively, were
injected subcutaneously (s.c.) above the right flank, and tumor development was measured
twice a week with calipers. In some experiments, 1–2×106 tumor cells were labeled with 25
µM CFSE according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Tumor challenge
experiments were repeated independently at least 8 times with 4 mice per group. For
prophylactic immunization, mice were injected twice s.c., 7 days apart, with 2x106 DC or
monocytes that were loaded with tumor lysates or IC. This was independently repeated 3
times with 4 mice per group. For tumor recurrence studies, 2x105 tumor cells were injected
s.c. above the right flank, and the size of growing tumors was measured using calipers.

When tumors reached 45–55 mm2 for LMP and 12–16 mm2 for B16, mice were
anesthetized and visible macroscopic tumor was surgically removed. Resected tumors were
enzymatically digested with 0.1mg/mL of DNase I (Sigma) and 5mg/mL collagenase IV
(Sigma) in HBSS. Cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed
extensively in PBS and coated for 30 min with syngeneic or allogeneic antibodies. In some
experiments, tumor cells were coated with mouse anti-mouse anti-H2-Kb (2µg/1x105 cells)
or its isotype control (C1.18.4, both from BioXcell). Antibody-coated tumor cells were then
washed and added to DC cultures. After overnight incubation, DC were washed and 2.5x106
were injected s.c. to tumor-resected mice one day after the tumors were removed, adjacent to
the site of tumor resection. This experiment was repeated independently at least 3 times with
4 mice per group. For in vivo tumor treatments, a combination of 2 µg TNFα (Peprotech)
and 100 µg agonistic αCD40 (FGK4.5, BioXcell), 5 µg recombinant CD40L (PeproTech), 5
µg CD28 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 5 µg LPS or 200 µg polyI:C (Invivogen), and
400 µg mouse allogeneic or syngeneic IgG or anti-GP-NMB (Santa Cruz), was injected
twice (2 days apart) directly into tumors. Experiments were repeated independently at least 5
times with 4–5 mice per group. For treatment of the BrafV600E melanoma model, mice were
injected twice (2 days apart) in 2 cycles, one week apart, with 1mg IgG derived from CD-1
mice along with TNFα and αCD40 once the largest tumor nodule reached 16mm2. For
metastasis experiments, 1x105 4T-1 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of
syngeneic Balb/c mice. After 14–16 days, once tumors metastasized into the draining lymph
node, the primary tumor nodules were injected twice (2 days apart) in 2 cycles, one week
apart, with 1mg IgG derived from CD-1 mice along with TNFα and αCD40. Experiments
were repeated independently at least 3 times with 3–5 mice per group.
In vivo binding of PE-labeled alloIgG

Author Manuscript

Allogeneic antibodies were fluorescently labeled with PE using Lightning-Link® kits
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Innova Biosciences Ltd., Cambridge, UK).
Subsequently, 5 µg of labeled alloIgG was injected intratumorally alone or with TNFα and
αCD40. After 2 h, tumors were enzymatically digested to obtain a single cell suspension and
the PE levels were analyzed by flow cytometry along with lineage markers.
Covalent binding of syngeneic antibodies to tumor cells

Author Manuscript

Syngeneic IgG was cross-linked to primary amines of B16 cell surface proteins using sulfoLC-SPDP (sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(3’-[2-pyridyldithio]-propionamido) hexanoate, Pierce)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, both the antibodies and cells were
initially treated with sulfo-LC-SPDP to label primary amines. Next, disulfide bonds in
syngeneic IgG were reduced by treatment with DTT. Finally, the reduced syngeneic IgG was
incubated with SPDP-labeled B16 cells and the level of binding was later assessed by flow
cytometry. Experiments were repeated independently 3 times with 4 mice per group.
In vivo cell depletion
Depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was achieved by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 500
µg/mouse GK1.5 (anti-CD4) and YST-169.4 (anti-CD8) monoclonal antibodies (both from
BioXcell, West Lebanon, NH), respectively, 3 days before tumor inoculation and every 3
days thereafter. T cell depletion experiments were repeated independently 3 times for each

depletion antibody with 3–4 mice per group. In some experiments, B16-bearing mice were
injected with 500 µg/mouse anti-CD8 or anti-CD4 2 days prior to their treatment with
antibodies+TNFα+αCD40 and once a week thereafter. These T cell depletion experiments
were repeated independently 2 times for each depletion antibody with 5 mice per group. For
B cell depletion, 300 µg/mouse anti-CD19 (1D3) and 300 µg/mouse anti-B220
(RA3.3A1/6.1) (both from BioXcell) were injected i.p. three weeks before tumor inoculation
and every 5 days thereafter. B cell depletion experiments were repeated independently 3
times with 3–5 mice per group. For NK cell depletion, mice were injected i.p. with 50 µl
anti-asialo (GM1) polyclonal antibody (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), or with 200 µg
anti-NK1.1 (PK136) (BioXCell) on days −2, 0, 4, and 8 relative to tumor challenge.
Individual mice were bled on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 and the levels of NK1.1+/CD3ɛneg cells
were determined by flow cytometry to confirm depletion. NK cell depletion experiments
were repeated independently 3 times with anti-asialo depletion antibody with 3–5 mice per
group.
Adoptive transfer

Author Manuscript

Mice were injected i.v. with 1 mg/mouse of syngeneic or allogeneic IgG or IgM one day
prior to tumor challenge and once again with tumor injection. For T cell transfer, splenic
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were negatively selected using a murine enrichment kit (Stem Cell
Technologies) and at least 5x106 cells were injected i.v. to recipient mice one day before
tumor challenge. T cell adoptive transfer experiments were repeated independently 3 times
for each T cell subset with 3–5 mice per group. Prior to their transfer, tumor-associated cell
subsets were enriched as follows: TADC were isolated by enrichment of MHCII+ cells on
magnetic beads (Miltenyi) and subsequent sorting of Ly6Cneg/CD11c+/CD64dim by FACS.
Tumor macrophages were enriched with CD11b+ magnetic beads (Miltenyi) followed by
sorting of Ly6Cneg/CD64hi cells. B cells were enriched with CD19+ magnetic beads
(Miltenyi). NK cells were enriched with NK1.1+ magnetic beads (Miltenyi), and mast cells
were enriched with c-kit+ magnetic beads (Miltenyi). For each cell subset, 2x106 cells were
injected s.c. into naïve mice 3 days before being challenged with 5x104 B16 tumor cells.
Transfer experiments for each cell type were repeated 3 times independently with 3–5 mice
per group.
T cell proliferation

Author Manuscript

3x104 DC were co-cultured with 3x105 MACS-enriched CD4+ T cells (Miltenyi, Germany)
from spleens of LMP- or B16-immunized mice. After 6 days, cells were pulsed with 3Hthymidine (1 µCi/well) and cultured for an additional 18h before being harvested in a
Harvester 400 (Tomtec). Radioactivity was measured by a 1450 MicroBeta counter (LKB
Wallac). T cell proliferation was repeated 5 times with 3 biological replicates and 6 technical
replicates for each.
In vivo BrdU incorporation
Tumor-challenged mice were injected i.p. every day with 1mg of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine
(BrdU) in 200 µL PBS. At several time points, mice were sacrificed and single cell
suspensions were prepared from BM, lymph nodes and tumor tissues. Cells were then
stained for lineage markers followed by intracellular staining with FITC-conjugated antiNature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 23.

Carmi et al.

BrdU antibody according to manufacturer’s instructions (BD Pharmingen) and analyzed by
flow cytometry. Experiments were repeated independently 3 times with 3–5 mice per group.
Immunofluorescence
DC or monocytes were incubated on glass-bottom culture plates (In Vitro Scientific) with
CFSE-labeled tumor cells with or without antibodies overnight. Cells were gently washed
with PBS (Gibco), fixed for 20 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with
0.5% saponin (Sigma). Samples were blocked with 10% non-immune goat serum and
stained with Alexa-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and IgM (Invitrogen 1:100) and anti-mouse
I-Ab (BD Biosciences, 1:100). DC immunostainings were independently repeated at least 3
times in biological duplicates and 3 fields were documented in each slide.
Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, equilibrated in a 20% sucrose solution and
embedded in frozen tissue matrix (Tissue-Tek OCT, Torrance, CA). Slides were cut to 5 µm,
blocked with 10% non-immune goat serum and stained with goat anti-mouse IgG
(Invitrogen 1:100) and anti-mouse IgM (II/41 eBioscience, 1:100). Sections were examined
under a Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. Images were collected using a Zeiss
700 confocal laser scanning microscope, and analyzed using ZEN software (Carl Zeiss
Microscopy). Tumor immunostainings were repeated independently at least 3 times in
biological duplicates and 3 fields were captured for each slide.
Statistics

Author Manuscript

Sample size was chosen such that statistical significance could be achieved using
appropriate statistical tests (e.g. ANOVA) with errors approximated from previously
reported studies. A non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test was performed in Prism
(GraphPad Software, Inc.) to analyze experimental data, unless otherwise stated. Phosphospecific flow cytometry data were transformed by taking the inverse hyperbolic sine
(arcsinh), and ratios were taken over the corresponding baseline (unstimulated) value as
previously described (Irish et al., PNAS, 2010). No blinded experiments were performed. No
samples were excluded from analyses. P values indicate significance of the difference
between experimental and control (CT) values. * denotes p<0.05; ** denotes p<0.01. Error
bars represent +/− SEM.

a.–c. 20 µg of native cell membrane proteins were incubated with 50 µg of syngeneic (C57Bl/6) or allogeneic (129S1) IgG coupled to protein G magnetic
beads and precipitated proteins were analyzed by mass-spectrometry. Tables show the conversion to Spectral Abundance Factor (SAF) and subsequent
Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor (NSAF). This was based on the equation: NSAF = (SpC/MW)/Σ(SpC/MW)N. Where SpC = Spectral Counts,
MW = Protein MW in kDa and N = Total Number of Proteins.

a. Tumor growth following intratumoral injection of PBS, 129S1 IgG or C57Bl/6 IgG (n=6).
b. CD86 and MHCII expression on DC incubated with PBS, tumor lysates or alloIgG-IC
(n=5). c. TNFα and IL-12 in the supernatants of DC cultured with PBS control, LMP lysate
or alloIgG-IC (n=5). d. Proliferation of CD4+ T cells cultured with DC treated with PBS,
tumor lysate, or alloIgG-IC (n=5). e. Recurrence of resected LMP and B16 in untreated mice
or mice treated with alloIgG-IC-activated BMDC or TADC (n=5). f. p-p38, pERK1/2 and
pJNK levels in DC, untreated or incubated with alloIgG-IC. Graphs show arcsinh ratios of
phospho-species in DC incubated for 5 min with LMP lysate or alloIgG-IC over baseline
levels from unstimulated DC (n=5). g. MHCII and CD86 expression and CFSE
internalization by TADC after overnight culture with CFSE-labeled alloIgG-IC (n=4).
Experiments were independently repeated at least 3 times and analyzed by Mann–Whitney
U test. Asterisk (*) denotes p<0.05 and two asterisks (**) denote p<0.01.

upregulation by DC (left) and proliferative response of CD4+ T cells (right) from
mesothelioma (MSTO) patients after culture of autologous BMDC with selfIgG- or alloIgGcoated autologous tumor cells (n=2). Mouse experiments were independently repeated at
least 3 times and analyzed by Mann–Whitney U test. Asterisk (*) denotes p<0.05 and two
