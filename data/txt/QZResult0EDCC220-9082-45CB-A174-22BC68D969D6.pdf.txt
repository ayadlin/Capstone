BACKGROUND: Crizotinib is used for the treatment of advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged nonsmall cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). Sinus bradycardia (SB) is a side effect listed in its package insert. We investigated the frequency and timing of SB,
patient characteristics associated with SB during crizotinib treatment, and potential correlation between heart rate (HR) changes and
clinical response to crizotinib. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of the timing and frequency of SB, patient
characteristics, and clinical response of patients to crizotinib treatment. RESULTS: Forty-twp patients who had ALK-rearranged or
mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET)-amplified NSCLC and received treatment with oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily who were
enrolled in 2 crizotinib trials (PROFILE 1001 and PROFILE 1005) were analyzed. There was an average decrease of 26.1 beats per minute (bpm) from the pretreatment HR among all patients during crizotinib treatment. Twenty-nine patients (69%) experienced at
least 1 episode of SB (HR, <60 bpm). The average time to the lowest HR recorded was 18.6 weeks (range, 5-72 weeks). Patients who
experienced SB were significantly older (aged 55.8 years vs 47.8 years; P ¼ .0336), had a lower pretreatment HR (mean, 77.9 bpm vs
100.6 bpm; P ¼ .002), and were on crizotinib longer (52.9 weeks vs 24.6 weeks; P ¼ .0050) than patients who did not experience SB.
The overall response rate (P ¼ .0195) and the maximum tumor shrinkage (P ¼ .0205) were significantly greater in patients who experienced SB. CONCLUSIONS: HR decrease is common during crizotinib treatment. It remains to be determined whether the correlation
between HR decrease and clinical response to crizotinib reflects a biomarker of drug efficacy or a time/cumulative dose-dependent

INTRODUCTION
Crizotinib is a first-in-class, orally available anaplastic kinase (ALK) inhibitor that has exhibited impressive clinical activity
in ALK-rearranged nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 2 phase 2, single-arm clinical trials.1-3 It has also demonstrated
significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) over single-agent chemotherapy as second-line treatment for
patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC in a randomized phase 3 trial.4 Crizotinib has been approved in many countries for
the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC. In addition, as a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that
also can inhibit both the mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) and ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinases, crizotinib has
demonstrated clinical activity in MET-amplified NSCLC and ROS1-rearranged NSCLC.5,6 Thus, crizotinib will likely
play an expanding role in targeted therapy for NSCLC.
Crizotinib is generally well tolerated, and most of its side effects are in the grade 1 and 2 range. The common side
effects reported are transient visual disorders and gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation).1-4 It
has also been reported that there was an average 2.5-beats per minute (bpm) decrease in the heart rate (HR) with every
100-ng/mL increase of serum crizotinib concentration.7 Indeed, according to the crizotinib package insert, grade 1 and 2
sinus bradycardia (SB) occurred in 5% of patients.8
We have observed many patients who had a reduction in their HRs while receiving crizotinib treatment, and a few
patients developed asymptomatic SB with an HR <45 bpm.9 This observation led us to perform a retrospective analysis
investigating the frequency, timing, and patient characteristics associated with SB during crizotinib treatment. In addition,
we performed an exploratory analysis of a potential correlation between HR changes and response to crizotinib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Patients with ALK-rearranged or MET-amplified NSCLC
who were enrolled in the molecular expansion cohort of
the PROFILE 1001 trial (National Clinical Trial [NCT]
00585195)
and
the
PROFILE
1005
trial
(NCT00932451) at the University of California Irvine
Medical Center were identified and analyzed. The main
eligibility criteria for both trials were aged >18 years,
stage IV ALK-rearranged NSCLC, and performance status from 0 to 2. PROFILE 1001 allows any line of prior
therapy, whereas PROFILE 1005 requires patients to fail
at least 1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy.
ALK rearrangement was detected by break-apart fluorescence in sit hybridization, as described previously.1 MET
amplification was determined by FISH, and MET/chromosome enumeration probe 7 (CEP7) values >2.2 were
considered amplified, as previously reported.5 Clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients were reviewed,
including age at diagnosis, sex, disease stage, smoking history, histology, number of prior regimens, performance
status, tumor response, degree of tumor shrinkage, pretreatment HR, and lowest HR achieved. Concomitant
medications including, beta-blockers and calcium channel
blockers, were reviewed. For patients enrolled in PROFILE 1001, disease assessment was performed every 8
weeks (2 cycles), whereas disease was assessed every 6
weeks (2 cycles) for patients enrolled in PROFILE 1005.
Clinic visits were every cycle for the first 15 cycles and
then every 2 cycles thereafter for both trials. All patients
received crizotinib 250 mg twice daily. Both trials allowed
continuation of crizotinib beyond progression according
to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) if there was ‘‘clinical benefit,’’ as determined by
the investigators. Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Event (CTCAE) version 3.0 was used to grade
adverse events. The data cutoff date was February 28,
2012. All patients signed informed consent. The PROFILE 1001 and 1005 trials both were approved by the
University of California Irvine Institutional Review Board.
Heart Rate Changes

CTCAE version 3 was used for both PROFILE 1001 and
1005. SB was defined as an HR <60 bpm. We defined
‘‘profound’’ SB as an HR <50 bpm. We chose this cutoff
level, because an HR <50 bpm is generally considered by
cardiologist the point at which patients potentially can experience SB symptoms, such as dizziness or syncope. All
patients had pretreatment electrocardiograms (ECGs), as
mandated by both clinical trials. ECGs were obtained
1970

from all patients who experienced an HR <60 bpm.
ECGs were obtained at every clinic visit if the HR was
45 bpm for patients with profound SB even if they
reported no symptoms after initial clinic visits. These
ECGs were not mandated by the protocols but were
obtained as part of the treatment monitoring as we
observed that more patients experienced symptomatic SB.
The pretreatment HR, the lowest HR achieved during
treatment, the time to maximum HR decrease, vital signs
(including blood pressure readings), and potential symptoms related to SB all were abstracted from clinic charts.
Tumor Response

RECIST version 1.0 was used to measure response in
PROFILE 8081001, and version 1.1 was used for PROFILE 1005. The maximum decrease in tumor measurement from the pretreatment baseline level was obtained
from clinic chart. A complete response (CR), a partial
response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease
(PD) were defined according to RECIST.
Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS statistical
software package (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
NC). Chi-square analysis was used to test dichotomous
variables, and the Student t test was used for continuous
variables. Statistical differences were considered significant when P values were < .05.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics Overall and According to
Sinus Bradycardia or No Sinus Bradycardia
Experienced

Forty-two patients (30 from PROFILE 1001 and 12 from
PROFILE 1005) were analyzed. None of the patients
were on any calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers
during crizotinib treatment. The first patient was started
on oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily on November 17,
2008, and the last patients started crizotinib on June 6,
2011. The mean follow-up for all patients was 48 weeks
(median, 42 weeks, 95% confidence interval, 4-116
weeks). Twenty-three patients still were receiving crizotinib treatment at the time of data cutoff. All patients had
adenocarcinoma histology. None of the patients had dose
reduction during crizotinib treatment. The clinicopathologic variables of all the patients are listed in Table 1.
There was a significant difference in the mean age at diagnosis between patients who did and did not experience SB
(P ¼ .0366) (Table 1). There was a statistically significant
difference in performance status between patients who
did and did not experience SB (P ¼ .0337), and 82.8% of

Profound Sinus Bradycardia

Among the 29 patients who experienced SB, 13 patients
(44.8%) experienced at least 1 episode of profound SB (HR,
<50 bpm). There was no difference in sex (P ¼ .9476),
race (P ¼ .7791), performance status (P ¼ .1411), or the
number of prior regimens (P ¼ .0902) among patients who
experienced profound SB, SB, or no SB. Although there also
was no difference in the age of diagnosis among the 3
groups, the patients who experienced profound SB had the
oldest median age of diagnosis at 58.7 years followed by age
53.1 years for patients who experienced SB only and age
47.8 years for patients who experienced no SB (P ¼ .0671).
There was a significant difference in the pretreatment HR (P ¼ .0003), the mean lowest HR recorded
1972

(P < .0001), or mean time to maximum HR decrease
(P ¼ .0261) among patients who experienced profound
SB, SB, and no SB (Table 2). It is worth noting that,
again, there was no statistically significance difference in
the average maximum HR decrease among patients who
experienced profound SB, SB, and no SB (P ¼ .5695)
(Table 2). None of the patients who experienced SB or
profound SB were symptomatic or had ECG changes,
such as PR or QTc prolongation.

also was significantly higher among patients who experienced SB than those who did not (P ¼ .0205) (Table 3).
When only considering patients who had achieved clinical
benefit (complete responses þ partial responses þ stable
disease), the maximum tumor shrinkage also was numerically higher among patients who experienced SB than
among those who did not, although the difference was not
statistically significant (P ¼ .0584) (Table 3).
Similarly, the overall response rate was highest among
patients who experienced profound SB, followed by
patients who experienced SB, and then patients who experienced no SB (P ¼ .0406) (Table 4). This also was similar
in patients who experienced profound SB, who had the
greatest reduction in cumulative tumor measurement from
baseline, followed by patients who experienced SB, and
then by patients who experienced no SB (P ¼ .0447)
(Table 4). Again, when only the patients who achieved
clinical benefit from crizotinib were included, the cumulative tumor reduction was numerically highest among
patients who experienced profound SB, although the difference was no longer significant (P ¼ .1171) (Table 4).
Heart Rate Changes and Clinical
Response by Sex

between men and women (men vs women: 53.9 years vs

difference in the mean treatment duration between men
and women (50.5 weeks vs 35.7 weeks, respectively; P ¼
.2970) or in the mean response duration (33.5 weeks vs
39.4 weeks, respectively; P ¼ .4841). There was no

difference in the mean pretreatment HR between men
and women (83.6 bpm vs 86.7 bpm, respectively; P ¼
.8189), the mean maximum decrease in HR recorded
(27.8 bpm vs 23.9 bpm, respectively; P ¼ .1814), the
mean lowest HR achieved (55.8 bpm vs 62.8, respectively;
P ¼ .5330), or the mean time to the lowest HR recorded
(22.1 weeks vs 14.1 weeks, respectively; P ¼ .2684).
In terms of clinical response to crizotinib, there was
no difference in the overall response rate between men
and women (45.8% vs 55.6%, respectively; P ¼ .5329).
Similarly, there was no difference in the average maximum tumor decrease between men and women (35.8% vs
41.9%, respectively; P ¼ .4450).
DISCUSSION
The major observation from this single-institution retrospective analysis of HR changes during crizotinib treatment is that HR decrease is a common phenomenon
during such treatment. HR decrease has been reported as
a pharmacodynamic phenomenon of crizotinib with an
average of 2.5 bpm decrease per 100 ng of crizotinib.7
The average pharmacokinetic level of crizotinib achieved
is approximately 280 ng/mL10; thus, the average HR
decrease should be approximately 8 bpm. We observed
that 90% of patients who were receiving crizotinib had a
1-time HR decrease >10 bpm. The average HR decrease
for all patients was approximately 26.1 bpm but without
any symptoms or ECG changes (such as PR or QTc prolongation). The higher than expected HR decrease
observed in this report may reflect individual pharmacokinetic variation or autoinhibition of crizotinib, because
1973

Original Article

crizotinib is a strong cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) inhibitor and also is itself metabolized by
CYP3A.
Our exploratory analysis also revealed that patients
who experienced SB had a significantly higher response
rate and greater cumulative tumor shrinkage during crizotinib therapy, and patients who experience profound SB
had the highest response rate and greatest cumulative tumor shrinkage. Patients who experienced profound SB
also were on crizotinib treatment the longest. Thus,
although this observation raises the possibility of a positive
correlation between the magnitude of HR decrease and
the extent of clinical benefit from crizotinib, it also may
only reflect that the magnitude of HR decrease is a timedependent or cumulative dose-dependent phenomenon.
Nevertheless, it points to the importance for oncologists
to try and avoid common medications that can cause HR
lowering, such as beta-blockers and calcium channel
blockers, during the entire course of crizotinib treatment,
because patients can continue to experience HR decrease
well into the course of their crizotinib treatment. We want
to emphasize that most of our patients were not in permanent SB. Many of these patients alternated between
normal sinus rhythm and SB during some of the subsequent clinic visits. Only a few patients were in persistent
SB during the majority of clinic visits.
The second observation is that SB from crizotinib is
more a reflection of the pretreatment HR rather than a
true adverse event per se. We observed that the HR before
patients received crizotinib treatment was significantly
higher among patients who did not experience SB than
among those who experienced SB, whereas there was no
statistically significant difference in the average maximum
HR decrease between these patient groups. We also
observed that older patients and patients with good performance status (conditions that are generally associated
with slower HR) were significantly more likely to experience SB while on crizotinib.
Neither CTCAE version 3 nor the newer version 4.0
specifies the HR at which it is considered SB. It is generally defined in cardiology that bradycardia occurs at an
HR <60 bpm. However, an oncologist following a
patient with ALK-rearranged NSCLC who is deriving
clinical benefit from crizotinib and is asymptomatic may
not consider an HR 59 bpm significant. Because
CTCAE grades the severity of SB by the presence or
absence of symptoms rather than by the actual lowest
recorded HR, we may not appreciate the extent of HR
decrease while reading the oncology literature. For example, our 3 previously reported asymptomatic patients who

had HRs <45 bpm while on crizotinib all were graded as
having grade 1 SB.9 In the future, we recommend incorporating specific ranges of the HR below 60 bpm in addition to symptoms experienced into the CTCAE grading
of SB to allow a better appreciation of the extent of the SB
by the oncology community.
It has been demonstrated that crizotinib causes a
rapid but reversible drop in testosterone in men, which
potentially may result in an HR decrease.11 Our analysis
did not reveal any significant difference in the HR parameters examined and the clinical response to crizotinib
between men and women. Thus, decrease in testosterone
level is unlikely to be a mechanism that accounts for the
HR decrease associated with the receipt of crizotinib.
Another potential cause of HR decrease may be hypothyroidism; however, we did not measure thyroid hormone
levels in any of our patients, because none of our patients
exhibited any signs of hypothyroidism.
The mechanism(s) that allow crizotinib to slow
down HR remain unknown. Given our observation that
crizotinib lowers the HR without any drop in blood
pressure, its effect on the heart is more likely to be chronotropic (which affects the sinoatrial lymph node) or dromotropic (which affects the atrioventricular lymph node)
rather than inotropic. Alternatively, the bradycardiac
effect of crizotinib may be because of its anti-MET effects,
because an analysis of tivantinib, another MET inhibitor,
also revealed HR decreases (Lee Rosen, University of California Los Angeles, personal communications).
With all of the limitations of this report, including
its retrospective nature, the limited number of patients analyzed, and the recording of the HR at irregularly spaced
intervals, depending on scheduled protocol visits, which
varied and became less frequent with prolonged crizotinib
treatment, it still represents the largest study to date
describing HR changes during crizotinib treatment and
exploring the potential relation between HR changes and
clinical response to crizotinib. Furthermore, the data from
this study have undergone extensive queries and qualitycontrol by the clinical trial sponsor (Pfizer Inc., Groton,
Conn), because they are part of the data submission to the
US Food and Drug Administration in support the orphan
drug application and eventual approval of crizotinib in
the United States. Our exploratory analysis of a positive
correlation of the magnitude of HR decrease with clinical
response and tumor shrinkage should be considered only
as hypothesis-generating. The PROFILE 1005 study has
now enrolled more than 1000 patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC and may provide a much more robust
analysis of the frequency of, timing, patient characteristics
