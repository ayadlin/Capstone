A single human cell contains more than 5.0  105 copies of long interspersed element-1 (L1), 80–100 of which are competent for
retrotransposition (L1-RTP). Recent observations have revealed the presence of de novo L1 insertions in various tumors, but little is
known about its mechanism. Here, we found that 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-3,
8-dimethyl-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), food-borne carcinogens that are present in broiled meats, induced L1-RTP. This
induction was dependent on a cellular cascade comprising the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a mitogen-activated protein kinase,
and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein b. Notably, these compounds exhibited differential induction of L1-RTP. MeIQx-induced
L1-RTP was dependent on AhR nuclear translocator 1 (ARNT1), a counterpart of AhR required for gene expression in response to
environmental pollutants. By contrast, PhIP-induced L1-RTP did not require ARNT1 but was dependent on estrogen receptor a (ERa)
and AhR repressor. In vivo studies using transgenic mice harboring the human L1 gene indicated that PhIP-induced L1-RTP was
reproducibly detected in the mammary gland, which is a target organ of PhIP-induced carcinoma. Moreover, picomolar levels of
each compound induced L1-RTP, which is comparable to the PhIP concentration detected in human breast milk. Data suggest that
somatic cells possess machineries that induce L1-RTP in response to the carcinogenic compounds. Together with data showing that
micromolar levels of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) were non-genotoxic, our observations indicate that L1-RTP by environmental
compounds is a novel type of genomic instability, further suggesting that analysis of L1-RTP by HCAs is a novel approach to
clariﬁcation of modes of carcinogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Long interspersed element-1 (L1) is the most abundant transposable element, comprising approximately 17% of the human
genome.1 A single cell contains more than 5.0  105 copies of L1,
80–100 copies of which are competent for retrotransposition (L1RTP).1,2 Although approximately 10% of these RTP-competent L1s
are highly active, actual occurrence of L1-RTP in the germline has
been estimated to be one out of every 108 births.2,3 L1 encodes
two proteins: open reading frames 1 and 2 (ORF1 and 2).3,4 ORF1 is
a 40-kDa protein present within cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein
complexes or stress granules in cytoplasm.5,6 It acts on L1 mRNA in
cis7 and functions as a chaperone of L1 mRNA.8 By contrast, ORF2
is an approximately 150-kDa protein with both reverse
transcriptase9 and endonuclease10 activities. ORF2 recognizes
the sequence 50 -TAAAA-30 and induces a nick between the
T and A,11,12 leading to ﬁrst-strand DNA synthesis by target siteprimed reverse transcription.3,4,13 Notably, ORF1 and 2 complete
the entire process of L1-RTP2–4,13 and are competent for the
induction of retrotransposition of non-autonomous retroelements,
such as Alu14,15 and SVA (SINE, variable numbers of tandem
repeats and Alu).16

Vitullo et al.17 recently reported that the copy numbers of
mouse L1 were increased during 2–4-blastomere stages. Moreover, it was demonstrated that L1-RTP suppression by blocking
reverse transcriptase activity impaired further cellular division.18
These ﬁndings indicate that L1-RTP is a pivotal molecular event in
early embryogenesis. However, L1-RTP in oocytes accidently
causes inborn errors: 490 types of intractable diseases were
identiﬁed as sporadic cases that were caused by mutagenic
insertions of endogenous retroelements.3,4,19 Although most were
due to Alu insertions, a recent review indicated the involvement of
L1-RTP in 25 sporadic cases of 11 types of genetic disorder.20
Given the importance of L1-RTP during early embryogenesis, most
studies of L1 have focused on germ cells and stem cells.21–23
However, recent reports of detection of de novo L1 and Alu
insertions in brain tissues24–26 and various cancers27–30 indicate
that the mode of RTP in somatic cells is an emerging issue in terms
of their biological effects.31 Intriguingly, a recent report involving
use of a highly advanced genome analysis technology identiﬁed
194 de novo insertions of endogenous retroelements in 43
tumors.32 Moreover, all of the somatic insertions of L1 or Alu
were detected in cancers with epithelial-cell origin, and 64

insertions were identiﬁed in 62 annotated genes, the functions of
which were associated with tumor suppression. These
observations suggest active involvement of RTP in carcinogenesis.32 Although the mechanism underlying RTP induction in
epithelial cells remains to be elucidated, it is tempting to
speculate that environmental factors are involved in the
induction of cancer-related L1-RTP.
Reported inducers of L1-RTP in somatic cells include gamma
irradiation,33 heavy metals34 and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)35
We recently discovered 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), a
tryptophan photoproduct, as a potent inducer of L1-RTP.36
We also found that L1-RTP was induced during two-stage skin
carcinogenesis that was initiated by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13acetate.37 Interestingly, DMBA induction of L1-RTP was
dependent on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and AhR
nuclear translocator 1 (ARNT1).38 AhR and ARNT1 are members of
the basic helix-loop-helix/pas-arnt-sim (bHLH/PAS) family, which is
well conserved among species39 and comprises transcription
factors involved in various biological functions.40,41 The most wellcharacterized function of AhR is its binding to environmental
pollutants, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and
formation of a complex with ARNT1 (AHR complex), which is
recruited to chromatin.40,41 Notably, chromatin recruitment of the
AHR complex depends on the ARNT1 nuclear localization signal.42
Here, we report that 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo
[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), heterocyclic amines (HCAs) formed during
the cooking of red meat,43,44 induced L1-RTP. Among HCAs, PhIP
and MeIQx are important because their levels are high in food.45
Notably, picomolar levels of PhIP were identiﬁed in human breast
milk,46 and HCAs have been shown to be carcinogenic in rodent
models.47–51 PhIP induces carcinoma formation in colon and
reproductive organs such as mammary gland and prostate,47–49
whereas MeIQx induces colon carcinoma and hepatoma.50,51
These observations imply that humans are exposed daily to
carcinogenic compounds, albeit at low concentrations.52 Here, we
present data showing that L1-RTP by both compounds depends
on AhR, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and CCAAT/
enhancer-binding protein b (C/EBP-b). Interestingly, however,
ARNT1 is required for MeIQx-induced L1-RTP but not PhIPinduced L1-RTP. Instead, PhIP-induced L1-RTP depends on
estrogen receptor a (ERa) and AhRR, a repressor of AhR, another
member of the bHLH/PAS family53 We also investigated the
effects of these HCAs in transgenic mice that harbored human L1
as the transgene.37 Notably, L1-RTP in the mammary gland was
selectively induced by PhIP in an ERa-dependent manner. Taken
together with the fact that these compounds did not induce a
cellular response that is triggered by DNA damage, we discuss
that L1-RTP is a novel mode of carcinogenesis that is induced by
non-genotoxic effects of environmental carcinogens.
RESULTS
We ﬁrst evaluated HCA-induced L1-RTP using a colony-formation
assay, in which L1-RTP induced expression of a functional
neomycin-resistant gene, and supported growth of cells cultured
in the presence of neomycin. According to the experimental
procedures shown in Figures 1a and b, HuH-7 human hepatoma
cells were ﬁrst transfected with pCEP4/L1mneoI/ColE1 (pL1-NeoR,
Figure 1a),54,55 selected with hygromycin, and then treated with
PhIP or MeIQx on day 3 after transfection. Approximately 5.0  105
cells were treated initially with B7.5 mM of the synthesized
acetoxy-forms of HCAs, which are activated forms of each
compound43,56 (each formula is depicted in Supplementary
Figure S1). After neomycin selection, we observed 10–20 colonies
on each plate (Figure 1c), indicating that the frequency of L1-RTP
induction by both compounds was approximately 1 per 104

(*Po0.01). The induction of L1-RTP by each compound was also
evaluated using a PCR-based assay that involved detection of a
140-bp band ampliﬁed from a functional EGFP (enhanced green
ﬂuorescent protein) cDNA in pEF06R, a reporter construct
(Figure 1a).33 As shown in Figure 1d, both compounds induced
L1-RTP in different cell lines, including Li-7 (human hepatoma),
HepG2 (human hepatoma) and Caco-2 (colon carcinoma). We then
determined whether low doses of HCAs induced L1-RTP. As shown
in Figure 1e, even 3.5 pM of PhIP and MeIQx induced L1-RTP in
HuH-7 cells, at a frequency of approximately 1 per 105 (Figure 1e,
lanes 3 and 4) when judged by the signal densities of the 140-bp
band normalized by b-actin. Importantly, no cytotoxic effects of
the compounds at concentration up to 46 mM were detected
(Figure 2a). Moreover, both compounds at 17.5 or 8.8 mM,
respectively, did not induce expression of g-H2AX (Figure 2b),
and we detected no focus formation of g-H2AX or phosphorylated
ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) upon treatment of cells with
the compounds at 23 mM (Figure 2c). Taken together, these
observations indicate that induction of L1-RTP by micromolar HCA
levels was attributable to the non-genotoxic effects of the
compounds.
To determine the mode of HCA-induced L1-RTP, we ﬁrst
investigated the involvement of AhR, a cellular binding molecule
for these compounds.57 Initially, we tested the effects of
30 -methoxy-40 -nitroﬂavone (MNF), an AhR inhibitor;36,37,58 this
compound completely blocked L1-RTP induction (Supplementary
Figure S2, lanes 7 and 8). To further demonstrate this AhR
dependency, we examined the effects of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) on AhR. First, we conﬁrmed that both of two different AhR

siRNAs reduced the expression of endogenous protein (Figure 3a,
lanes 4 and 5). The PCR-based assay was then carried out after AhR
siRNA transfection. As shown in Figure 3b, the induction of
L1-RTP by both HCAs was blocked by one of the AhR siRNAs ( 1 in
Figure 3a). The other AhR siRNA ( 2 in Figure 3a) also attenuated
L1-RTP (Supplementary Figure S3).
We next studied the necessity of ARNT1 for L1-RTP induction
using ARNT1 siRNAs that efﬁciently reduced the expression of
endogenous protein (a representative result of the two siRNAs is
shown in Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure S4a; see also
Supplementary Figure S3a for results of another ARNT1 siRNA).
Similar to AhR siRNA, ARNT1 siRNA markedly reduced MeIQxinduced L1-RTP (Figure 3d, lane 11). Interestingly, however, it did
not reduce PhIP-induced L1-RTP (Figure 3d, lane 12). As reported
previously, we conﬁrmed that the AhR and ARNT1 siRNAs
abolished the expression of CYP1A1, a target gene expressed in
response to FICZ,59 indicating that each siRNA effectively
abolished the endogenous function of the AHR complex. We
also investigated the involvement of AhRR in HCA-induced L1-RTP.
By western blot (WB) analysis using an antibody to AhRR (aAhRR)
(Figure 3e)60 we conﬁrmed that two different AhRR siRNAs
efﬁciently down-regulated endogenous AhRR protein. Then, we
discovered that transfection of AhRR siRNA attenuated L1-RTP
induction by PhIP. By striking contrast, it did not affect L1-RTP by
MeIQx. Taken together, these data suggest that PhIP and MeIQx
induced L1-RTP via different mechanisms.
Picomolar quantity of PhIP exerts growth-promoting effects that
are ERa-dependent.52 To show the involvement of ERa in PhIPinduced L1-RTP, we determined the effects of fulvestrant, an ERa

inhibitor.61 Consistent with the previous report,61 the addition of
fulvestrant to the culture of MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells
down-regulated ERa expression (Figure 4a). Next, we investigated
the effects of fulvestrant on the induction of L1-RTP by PhIP.
Notably, fulvestrant selectively attenuated PhIP-induced L1-RTP
(Figure 4b, compare lanes 3 and 7), whereas it did not attenuate
MeIQx-induced L1-RTP (Figure 4b, lanes 2 and 6). We also
observed that ERa siRNA completely blocked PhIP-induced L1RTP (a representative result of the two siRNAs is shown in Figures
4c and d, lanes 11 and Supplementary Figures S3b and 4b). By
striking contrast, MeIQx-induced L1-RTP was resistant to ERa
siRNA. Interestingly, a non-acetoxy form of PhIP, which is present
in the human diet as a major subclass,44,45 also induced L1-RTP
(Figure 4b, lane 4; Figure 4d, lane 4). Notably, L1-RTP was again
blocked by inhibition of ERa (Figure 4b, lane 8; Figure 4d, lanes 8
and 12).
Based on an observation that ligand-bound AhR activates
MAPKs,62 we next examined the involvement of MAPKs in HCAinduced L1-RTP. Consistent with our previous observations,36,37,63
L1-RTP was effectively blocked by SB202190 and SP600125,
inhibitors of p38 and JNK (Janus kinase), respectively. The
Oncogene (2013) 4903 – 4912

PCR-based assay also revealed the inhibitory effects of both
compounds on L1-RTP (Supplementary Figure S5). Interestingly,
WB analysis showed that the compounds markedly phosphorylated C/EBP-b, a substrate of p38 (Figure 5b, lanes 3 and 4).
Moreover, AhR siRNA abrogated HCA-induced phosphorylation of
C/EBP-b (Figure 5c, lanes 7 and 8), and the down-regulation of C/
EBP-b siRNA attenuated HCA-induced L1-RTP (Figure 5d, lanes 11
and 12 and Supplementary Figures S3c and 4c). These data
strongly suggest that both AhR-dependent activation of MAPKs
and C/EBP-b phosphorylation are involved in HCA-induced L1-RTP.
ORF1 is localized in cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes
or cytoplasmic stress granules,5,6 which prompted us to determine
whether ORF1 is recruited to chromatin upon exposure of cells to
HCAs. To demonstrate this, we performed a subcellular
fractionation analysis of ORF1 after transfection of expression
vectors encoding a chimeric ORF1-TAP protein.64 When the
transfectants were treated with MeIQx or PhIP, the amount of
ORF1 in the chromatin-rich fraction was increased without
apparent changes in the total amount of ORF1 (Figure 6a, lanes
2 and 3). Notably, ORF1 was detected only when the nuclearinsoluble fractions were treated with micrococcal nuclease

(Figure 6b, lanes 11 and 12). Notably, HCA-induced chromatin
recruitment of ORF1 was blocked by both AhR siRNA (a
representative result of the two siRNAs is shown in Figure 6c, lanes
5 and 6 and Supplementary Figure S6a) and MAPK inhibitors
(Figure 6d, lanes 5, 6, 8 and 9). Moreover, the PhIP-induced
chromatin recruitment of ORF1 was blocked by AhRR siRNA (a
representative result of the two siRNAs is shown in Figure 6e, lanes 6
and Supplementary Figure S6b) and fulvestrant (Figure 6f, lane 6).
The chromatin recruitment of ORF1 suggests its association
with ERa. To investigate this possibility, we transfected MCF-7 cells
with pORF1-EGFP encoding a chimeric ORF1-EGFP protein, treated
them with HCAs and performed immunoprecipitation (IP)
followed by WB analysis. IP with aERa followed by WB analysis
with aEGFP deﬁnitely revealed that ORF1 associated with ERa
upon PhIP treatment (Figure 7a, lane 6, arrow). However, this was
not the case for MeIQx (lane 5). Moreover, a reciprocal experiment,
in which IP was performed using aEGFP followed by WB analysis
using aERa, detected the interaction of ORF1 and ERa in PhIPtreated cells (Figure 7b, lane 6, arrow). We next determined
whether ORF1 formed a complex with C/EBP-b. IP-WB analysis
using expression vectors encoding streptag-ORF1 (pST-ORF1) and
ﬂag-tagged C/EBP-b (pFlag-C/EBP-b) revealed that these two
molecules were constitutively associated (Figure 7c, lane 4, Be:
bead). By contrast, ﬂag-tagged ovalbumin (OVA) was not
associated with ST-ORF1 under the same conditions (lane 2),
indicating that the interaction of these molecules was not due to a
non-speciﬁc binding property of ORF1. Conversely, a reciprocal
experiment conﬁrmed the association of C/EBP-b and ORF1
(Figure 7d). Taken together, these data indicate that ORF1
constitutively forms a complex with C/EBP-b and that it can
associate with ERa in response to the addition of PhIP.
To examine whether the HCAs induced L1-RTP in vivo, we used
hL1-EGFP mice (No. 4 and No. 67).37 In our previous work, we

proved that these mice were suitable for studying the modes of
L1-RTP in somatic cells, because these mice possessed low
background of L1-RTP during embryogenesis, but they
responded for induction of L1-RTP in response to environmental
carcinogens.37 When the mice were injected intraperitoneally with
3 nM of HCAs three times (estimated in blood concentration), L1RTP was detected in the bone marrow (Figure 8a). Notably, PhIP
induced L1-RTP in the mammary gland and colon, whereas MeIQx
induced L1-RTP in the liver, spleen and gastric mucosa (one
representative result of three independent experiments are
shown). To determine whether HCA-induced L1-RTP is also
dependent on the AhR gene, we used homozygous null AhR
(AhR  /  ) mice.65 No induction of HCA-induced L1-RTP was
observed in No. 4h L1-EGFP/AhR  /  mice (Figure 8b, lanes 8 and
9) or in No. 67 hL1-EGFP/AhR  /  mice (Supplementary Figure S7).
To exclude the possibility that hL1-EGFP/AhR  /  mice possessed
defective cellular machinery required for the induction of L1-RTP,
we examined the induction of L1-RTP by FICZ. Consistent with our
previous observation that FICZ-induced L1-RTP was not AhRdependent36 the administration of FICZ robustly induced L1-RTP
in the thymus, lymph node and liver of hL1-EGFP/AhR  /  mice
(Supplementary Figure S8). The data indicate that L1-EGFP/AhR  / 
mice were competent for L1-RTP and HCA-induced L1-RTP was
AhR-dependent. Interestingly, L1-RTP was occasionally identiﬁed
in hL1-EGFP/AhR þ /  mice (Figure 8b, lane 5). A plausible
explanation is that the amount of AhR protein derived from the
intact single allele of the AhR gene is sufﬁcient for the induction of
L1-RTP.
We further tested whether lower doses of the HCAs resulted in
induction of L1-RTP. After 3 pM of the HCAs were injected
intraperitoneally three times per week for 6 weeks, mammary

gland, colon and liver tissues were subjected to the PCR-based
assay. As shown in Figure 8c, PhIP induced L1-RTP in the
mammary gland and colon (lanes 9 and 15). Several independent
experiments indicated that the repetitive administration of low
doses of PhIP reproducibly induced L1-RTP in the mammary
gland, whereas MeIQx did not (Table 1, Po0.0001). To demonstrate that an orally administered compound is also capable of
induction of L1-RTP, we directly injected PhIP into the stomach
and evaluated the presence of L1-RTP in the mammary gland.
Administration of PhIP of both 6 (Figure 8d, left panel) and 1.8

DISCUSSION
Recent advances in genome analysis technology have allowed
determination of the numbers of de novo L1 insertions in cancers
with epithelial-cell origin.32 Based on information regarding L1
integration sites, a positive role L1-RTP in carcinogenesis has been
postulated.32 Although the mechanism of L1-RTP induction during
carcinogenesis remains elusive, our current work supports that
environmental carcinogens function as the trigger: both PhIP and
MeIQx, food-borne carcinogens,43,44 reproducibly induced L1-RTP
in vitro and in vivo. However, it is important to demonstrate that
L1-RTP is induced by HCAs in an endogenous setting because our
current observations were obtained by the hL1-EGFP mice, in
which multiple copies of human L1 were integrated as the

Figure 9. Hypothetical modes of L1-RTP differentially regulated by
MeIQx and PhIP. Based on experimental data, a schematic of L1-RTP
by HCAs was described. L1-RTP by MeIQx depended on AhR and
ARNT1, a classical set of the AHR complex. By contrast, PhIP induces
L1-RTP depending on AhR, AhRR and ERa, which might recognize a
genome locus different from XRE.

transgene.37 One approach is to characterize L1-RTP after
exposing PhIP to primary cultured human cells that are derived,
for example, from mammary gland. By comparison of integration
sites of L1 in PhIP-treated cells and de novo L1 insertions in breast
carcinomas, it might be possible to approach roles of PhIP in
carcinogenesis.
Several independent experiments revealed that PhIP selectively
induced L1-RTP in the mammary gland. Fourteen out of the 16
PhIP-treated mice examined were positive for L1-RTP in the
mammary gland of the hL1-EGFP mice (Table 1). By contrast, no
L1-RTP was detected in the corresponding tissue of MeIQx-treated
mice. Interestingly, biochemical analyses revealed that both
compounds induced L1-RTP in an AhR-dependent manner;
however, MeIQx-induced L1-RTP required ARNT1, whereas PhIPinduced L1-RTP did not require ARNT1 but depended on ERa
(Figure 4). The requirement of ERa for PhIP-induced L1-RTP was
further supported by data showing that PhIP promoted the
association of ORF1 and ERa (Figure 7a). Additionally, the PhIPinduced chromatin recruitment of ORF1 was abrogated by
fulvestrant (Figure 6f), implying that the dependency of
PhIP-induced L1-RTP on ERa is related to the mode by which
PhIP induces malignancies in reproductive organs.47–49 Also,

PhIP-induced L1-RTP was AhRR-dependent (Figure 3f), and PhIPinduced recruitment of ORF1 to chromatin required AhRR
(Figure 6e). AhRR was originally identiﬁed as a repressor of
AhR,53 but recent studies suggested AhRR to possess additional
activities that include regulatory function in mammalian
reproduction.66 Further analysis may disclose a novel function of
AhRR in the responses of cells to environmental carcinogens, such
as PhIP.
It has been well-known that ligand-bound AhR associates with
ARNT1, forms an AHR complex and is recruited to the XRE, leading
to the transcription of genes, such as CYP1A1.39,40 ARNT1 is crucial
for this process, because the chromatin recruitment of the AHR
complex depends on the nuclear localization signal of ARNT1.42 As
L1-RTP induction by PhIP depended on AhR but not ARNT1, the
mode of PhIP-induced L1-RTP is different from the classical cellular
cascade of the AHR complex. Moreover, the PhIP-induced
chromatin recruitment of ORF1 was dependent on AhR, AhRR
and ERa (Figure 6). Data imply that the genomic loci to which
ORF1 is recruited in response to PhIP differ from those determined
by the AHR complex, and L1 integration sites of PhIP and MeIQx
might be different (Figure 9). Further studies are required to
investigate this possibility. Although it has been proposed that L1RTP is regulated at the transcriptional level,67,68 our analysis using
methylation-speciﬁc primers69 detected no changes of the
methylation status of the 50 untranslated region of L1 before
and after administration of HCAs (Supplementary Figure S9).
Additionally, no apparent increase of the expression of L1-mRNA
was detected after treatment of HCAs (Supplementary Figure S10).
Although it is possible that HCAs transiently modulate the L1
transcript levels, HCA-induction of L1-RTP is likely regulated
predominantly at the post-transcriptional level (Supplementary
Figure S10).
Notably, we reported previously that environmental carcinogens, such as DMBA, 3-methylcholanthrene and B[a]P induced in
an L1-RTP AhR-dependent manner.63 By contrast, FICZ, a
tryptophan photoproduct that is not carcinogenic,70,71 also
exhibited L1-RTP but in an AhR-independent manner. Together
with the report that AhR is required for the chemical
carcinogenesis caused by B[a]P72 and that L1-RTP induces a
variety of genetic alternations such as gene deletion and
chromosomal translocations,54,73 it is plausible that the AhRdependent L1-RTP has a positive link with carcinogenesis.
Moreover, L1-encoded proteins can induce RTP of other
retroelements such as Alu and SVA,14–16 and non-allelic
homologous recombination between Alu sequences is known to
ablate various tumor-suppressor genes that include BRAC1.74,75
These ﬁndings suggest that L1-RTP globally alternates the
genome integrity of cells, providing a growth advantage in
terms of cancer development. However, due to the low frequency
of L1-RTP by environmental carcinogens (approximately one in
every 105 cells), identiﬁcation and monitoring of cells positive for
L1-RTP during carcinogenesis is problematic. One approach to
demonstrate the role of L1-modulated cells in carcinogenesis is to
block RTP, for example, by siRNA of L1 mRNA in an organ of
interest76 and evaluate the effects on cancer development.
The carcinogenic effects of HCAs have been attributed to their
genotoxic activities.44,56 However, the PhIP concentration of PhIP
in human breast milk has been reported to be approximately 1 pg/
ml (3.6 pM),46 and plasma HCA concentrations were in the nM
range.52 Because PhIP at less than micromolar levels exhibits no
genotoxic activity, the level of HCA required to induce genetic
alternations remains to be clariﬁed. Here, we demonstrated that
nanomolar levels of HCAs induced L1-RTP (Table 1), but
micromolar PhIP levels were not genotoxic. Moreover, repeated
administration of mM levels of PhIP also induced L1-RTP in the
target organ (Figure 8d, Table 1). Taken together with a proposal
that low dose of PhIP exerts carcinogenic activity via ERa,52,77 data
indicate that ERa-dependent L1-RTP is a novel type of genetic
Oncogene (2013) 4903 – 4912

instability that is induced by non-genotoxic effects of
environmental compounds. Although humans are exposed to
low doses of PhIP, a life-long exposure to low levels of food-borne
carcinogens might lead to accumulation of cells positive for
genetic alternations caused by L1-RTP.

Science Resources Bank, Tokyo, Japan) were maintained at 37 1C and 5%
CO2 in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. Aetoxy-forms of HCAs (PhIP: molecular weight 286.3, MeIQx:

Hyogo, Japan). Non-acetoxy form PhIP (molecular weight 224.3) was from
Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. Other reagents, primary and secondary
antibodies used in the current studies are described in Supplementary
Information.

L1-RTP assays
L1-RTP was assayed as described previously,36,37 using pCEP4/L1mneoI/
ColE1 (pL1-NeoR)54,55 and pEF06R33 for colony-formation assay and a PCRbased assay, respectively. For the colony-formation assay, the cells were
cultured in the presence of 800 mg/ml neomycin, and numbers of
neomycin-resistant (NeoR) colonies were counted. For the PCR-based
assay, DNA was extracted from cells that were treated with the compounds
for 2 days (36, 38, Supplementary information). For ampliﬁcation of EGFP
cDNA, 50 -ACTGGGTGCTCAGGTAGTGGTT-30 and 50 -GAAGAACGGCATCAAGG
TGAA-30 were used as PCR forward and reverse primers, respectively. The
forward and reverse PCR primers for detecting human b-actin gene were
50 -TGAACCCCAAGGCCAACCGC-30 and 50 -TTGTGCTGGGTGCCAGGGCA-30 ,
respectively. For mouse b-actin gene, 50 -GAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-30
and 50 -AGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAA-30 were used. The conditions of PCR
ampliﬁcation of EGFP cDNA and b-actin are described in Supplementary
Information of full-methods.

Transfection of plasmid DNA and siRNAs
In all, 8 mg of plasmid DNA was transfected into HuH-7, HepG2, HEK293T,
Li-7, Caco-2 and HT1080 using Lipofectamine 2000, whereas it was
transfected into MCF-7 cells using Xfect (TAKARA, Otsu, Shiga, Japan).
siRNAs were synthesized by Applied Biosystems (Tokyo, Japan). Nucleotide
sequence of each siRNA was shown in Supplementary Table S1. As control,
Silencer Negative Control siRNA No. 2 (Cat No. AM4637, Life Technologies
Corporation, Calsbad, CA, USA) was used. HuH-7 or MCF-7 cells were
transfected with 25–100 nM siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies Corporation) or Xfect, respectively. For WB analysis, cell
extracts were prepared, as described.36,37

IP assay and immunohistochemical analysis
IP assay was carried out, according to the reported method36,37 To express
ORF1-EGFP, ST-ORF1, ﬂag-tagged C/EBP-b, ﬂag-tagged OVA and ST-EGFP,
we constructed pORF1-EGPF, pST-ORF1, pFlag-C/EBP-b, pFlag-OVA and
pST-EGFP. Cells were suspended in IP buffer composed of 20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.6), 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40 and 10% glycerol. Each
500 mg of cell extract was reacted with 4 mg of aAhR or aEGFP and then
recovered with protein G beads (GE Healthcare, Bio-Sciences Corp.,
Piscataway, NJ, USA). To analyze the association of ORF1 and C/EBP-b,
antibodies against Flag-tag, EGFP and ORF1 were ﬁrst reacted, and then
immune complexes were recovered with Dynabeads protein G or
Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin beads (Life Technologies Corporation). As
an input sample, about one-tenth of each extract subjected to IP was
loaded onto SDS–PAGE and simultaneously analyzed. The immunohistochemical analysis was done by the reported method.37

fraction was isolated using a Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit (Thermo
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA), as described.36 Nuclear insoluble fractions
were treated for 30 min with 300 U micrococcal nuclease (Thermo
Scientiﬁc) at 37 1C and centrifuged for 10 min. After centrifugation at
16 000 g, recovered supernatant was subjected to WB analysis.

Experiments using hL1-EGFP mice
We used hL1-EGFP transgenic mice of lines No. 4 and No. 67 that had low
background of spontaneous L1-RTP during embryogenesis.37 Each mouse
was crossed with heterozygous Ahr-deﬁcient (Ahr þ /  ) mice65 (Riken
Bioresource Center). Then, hL1-EGFP Ahr þ /  mice were mated with
Ahr þ /  mice to generate homozygous null mutant mice (hL1-EGFP/Ahr  /  )
that carried the hL1-EGFP transgene. Genotyping was performed using
DNA extracted from tails. HCAs or the same amount of dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) were administered intraperitoneally once 2 days. On day 2 after
the last injection, mice were killed and the PCR-based assay was done on
extracted DNA. To evaluate effects of orally administered PhIP,
approximately 3.3 or 1 mg of the compound, which were prepared in
100 ml of saline, were directly injected into the stomach of the mouse six or
six times, respectively. Maximum blood concentrations estimated by these
doses were of micromolar levels, respectively. As control, the same amount
of DMSO was injected. During experiments, no changes in body weight of
mice were detected. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of the NCGM Research Institute and conducted in
accordance with institutional procedures.

Protocol of administration of fulvestrant into hL1-EGFP mice
Effects of 7.7 mg/kg of fulvestrant on the induction of L1-RTP by PhIP were
evaluated. Fulvestrant was intraperitoneally injected 4 h before administration of PhIP. The similar regimens of administration were repeated three
times once 2 days. On day 2 after the last injection, genomic DNA
extracted from each organ was subjected to the PCR-based assay.

Statistics
Statistical signiﬁcance was evaluated using Mann–Whitney U test.
Numbers of test samples were more than four. Values of o0.05 were
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.
