Abstract
Metabolism of oxygen, while central to life, also produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have
been implicated in processes as diverse as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and aging. It has recently
been shown that central nervous system stem cells1, 2 and hematopoietic stem cells and early
progenitors3-6 contain lower levels of ROS than their more mature progeny and that these differences
appear to be critical for maintaining stem cell function. We hypothesized that epithelial tissue stem
cells and their cancer stem cell (CSC) counterparts may also share this property. Here we show that
normal mammary epithelial stem cells contain lower concentrations of ROS than their more mature

progeny cells. Congruently, subsets of CSCs in some human and murine breast tumors contain lower
ROS levels than corresponding non-tumorigenic cells (NTCs). Consistent with ROS being critical
mediators of ionizing radiation-induced cell killing7, 8, CSCs in these tumors develop less DNA
damage and are preferentially spared after irradiation compared to NTCs. Lower ROS levels in CSCs
are associated with increased expression of free radical scavenging systems. Pharmacologic depletion
of ROS scavengers in CSCs significantly decreases their clonogenicity and results in
radiosensitization. These results indicate that, similar to normal tissue stem cells, subsets of CSCs
in some tumors contain lower ROS levels and enhanced ROS defenses compared to their nontumorigenic progeny, which may contribute to tumor radioresistance.

We began by asking whether low ROS concentrations that appear to be critical to self renewal
of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)3, 5 are also a property of mammary epithelial stem cells9,
10 by isolating CD24medCD49fhighLin- mammary cells, a population enriched for mammary
repopulating units (MRUs), and CD24highCD49flowLin- progenitor cells by flow cytometry
(Supplementary Fig. S1) and measuring intracellular concentrations of prooxidants using 2′-7′dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) staining3. Cells in the MRU-enriched population
contained significantly lower concentrations of ROS than the progenitor-enriched cells in two
different strains of mice (Fig. 1a-c). Specifically, the MRU-enriched populations displayed
low to intermediate ROS levels, while the progenitor-enriched populations contained more
uniformly high levels of ROS. Similarly, analysis of the two populations with MitoSOX Red,
a highly selective detection method for mitochondrial superoxide, revealed lower superoxide
levels in the MRU-enriched population (Fig. 1d). In order to assess if mammary repopulating
activity was related to intracellular concentrations of ROS, we transplanted
CD24medCD49fhighLin- cells based on their levels of DCF-DA staining. Mammary stem cells
with both low and intermediate ROS levels gave rise to epithelial outgrowths when transplanted
into cleared fat pads (Supplementary Table 1). Similar heterogeneity of ROS concentrations
was recently demonstrated in HSC-enriched populations5, 11, where it may have functional
significance in modulating the HSC-niche interaction12.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the conservation of low ROS levels in several types of normal tissue stem cells, we
hypothesized that CSCs in some tumors may also contain lower concentrations of ROS than
their non-tumorigenic progeny. In order to investigate ROS biology in human CSCs, we began
by examining the expression of genes involved in ROS metabolism in primary human breast
CSCs and NTCs. Using microarray data from human breast CSC-enriched populations and
NTCs13 and a curated list of genes involved in ROS metabolism5 (see methods), Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)14 revealed that the expression of ROS genes was highly
overrepresented in the CD44+CD24-/lowLin- breast CSC-enriched population compared to
NTCs (p<0.001; Supplementary Fig. S2). The ROS genes identified as the core enriched genes
by GSEA included a number of important antioxidant genes (Supplementary Table 2). Thus,
gene expression profiles of human breast CSC-containing populations suggest that they contain
higher levels of antioxidant defense systems than NTCs.
Next, we directly assessed ROS levels in human tumor subpopulations. To do this the
CD44+CD24-/lowLin- breast CSC-enriched population and the corresponding “Not
CD44+CD24-/low” Lin- NTC population were purified from surgically resected breast tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S3). DCF-DA staining revealed that the CSC-enriched population in the
human breast tumors we examined contained significantly lower levels of prooxidants than the
NTC population. In some breast tumors, the vast majority of cells in the CSC-containing
fraction displayed a low ROS phenotype compared to NTCs (Fig. 1e) while in others it was
restricted to a significant subset of CSCs (Supplementary Fig. S4). We found a similar
enrichment of cells with low ROS concentrations in a head and neck tumor (Supplementary

Fig. S4). Thus, CSC-enriched populations from some human tumors contain lower average
intracellular ROS levels than corresponding NTC populations.

Recently, we have demonstrated that Thy1+CD24+Lin- cells in the majority of spontaneously
developing breast tumors from MMTV-Wnt-1 mice are highly enriched for tumorigenic
activity15 (Supplementary Fig. S5a). We therefore asked whether the CSC-enriched population
in this model system also displays a low ROS phenotype. ROS analysis using DCF-DA
revealed that in tumors in which the Thy1+CD24+Lin- population was enriched for CSCs, this
population contained a significantly higher fraction of cells with low prooxidant levels than
the “Not Thy1+CD24+” Lin- non-tumorigenic population (Fig. 1f). Thy1+CD24+Lin- cells
contained two main sub-populations of cells based on ROS concentration, with the low ROS
subpopulation being significantly overrepresented compared to NTCs (Supplementary Fig.
S5b). In order to confirm the presence of CSCs within the low ROS subpopulation, we
transplanted CSCs based on their DCF-DA staining and found that both the low and high ROS
subsets of Thy1+CD24+Lin- cells gave rise to tumors in recipient animals (Supplementary
Table 3). Thus, a subset of CSCs from these MMTV-Wnt-1 tumors displayed low baseline
levels of ROS compared to NTCs.

It is well established that cell killing after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and a subset of
cytotoxic chemotherapeutics is partially mediated by free radicals16. Given our observations
of increased expression of ROS defense genes in CSCs, we were therefore interested in testing
whether CSC-enriched populations develop less DNA damage after IR than NTCs. In order to
examine DNA damage immediately after irradiation, we purified Thy1+CD24+Lin- cells and
NTCs from MMTV-Wnt-1 tumors by flow cytometry and irradiated them on ice. Cells were
then either left on ice or incubated at 37°C, before being analyzed using the alkaline comet
assay17. While untreated cells did not display significantly different levels of DNA damage,
there were fewer DNA-strand breaks in the Thy1+CD24+Lin- cells than NTCs immediately
after exposure to IR (Fig. 2a-b). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced
expression of ROS defenses in CSCs contributes to reduced levels of DNA damage after
irradiation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since the alkaline comet assay mainly measures single strand breaks and since double strand
breaks are important for IR-induced lethality18, we also analyzed levels of double strand breaks
as reflected by phosphorylated histone 2AX (H2AX) nuclear foci after in vitro irradiation. As
with the comet assay, we again observed significantly lower levels of DNA damage in
Thy1+CD24+Lin- CSC-enriched cells than in NTCs (Supplementary Fig. S6). We also
measured phosphorylated H2AX foci after in vivo irradiation of MMTV-Wnt-1 tumors, and
again found that Thy1+CD24+Lin- cells contained fewer foci than NTCs (Fig. 2c). Thus,
consistent with their lower baseline levels of ROS, Thy1+CD24+Lin- CSC-enriched cells
isolated from these tumors developed less DNA strand breaks than NTCs after exposure to IR.
Given these findings, CSCs would be expected to preferentially survive exposure to IR in intact
tumors. Mice bearing MMTV-Wnt-1 tumors were therefore treated with short, fractionated
courses of IR and the percentage of the Thy1+CD24+Lin- CSC-enriched population before and
after irradiation was analyzed using flow cytometry. On average, we found an approximately
2 fold increase in the percentage of the Thy1+CD24+Lin- CSC-enriched population compared
with “Not Thy1+CD24+” Lin- NTCs in the irradiated tumors, suggesting that CSCs are
relatively radioresistant compared with NTCs (Fig. 3a-b). We found a similar increase in the
fraction of CD44+Lin- CSC-enriched population when we irradiated human head and neck
cancer xenografts grown in immunodeficient mice (Fig. 3c). Other investigators have
documented similar radioresistance of CSCs in brain tumors19 and a breast cancer cell line20.
Thus, CSCs in some murine and human tumors are relatively radioresistant compared to their
NTC counterparts.

Since a significant fraction of murine breast CSCs contained relatively low levels of ROS, we
hypothesized that these cells may express enhanced levels of ROS defenses compared to their
NTC counterparts. We were particularly interested in glutathione (GSH), a critical cellular
reducing agent and antioxidant which has been implicated in chemotherapy and radiotherapy
resistance of cancer cells21. Since our prior analyses revealed heterogeneity within CSCenriched populations and since single cell gene expression studies have revealed significant
variation in gene expression in other stem cell populations22, we investigated expression of
critical GSH biosynthesis genes in MMTV-Wnt-1 CSCs and NTCs using single cell qRT-PCR.
This analysis revealed significant overexpression of Gclm (p<0.001) and Gss (p<0.005) in a
large fraction of cells within the CSC-enriched population, the former of which encodes the
regulatory subunit of the enzyme (glutamate-cysteine ligase) that catalyzes the rate limiting
step of GSH synthesis (Fig4a)23. Furthermore, Foxo1, a transcription factor implicated in the
regulation of an anti-ROS gene expression program in HSCs5, was also overexpressed in CSCs
compared to NTCs (p<0.001; Fig.4a). Other genes, including Hif1a, Epas1, and Foxo4 were
not differentially expressed. Thus, genes controlling GSH biosynthesis were overexpressed by
many cells within the CSC-enriched population isolated from this tumor.

In order to pharmacologically manipulate ROS levels separately in CSCs and NTCs, we
employed in vitro culture conditions that allowed both cell populations to produce colonies
upon co-culture with irradiated feeder cells. We found that Thy1+CD24+Lin- CSC-enriched
cells were relatively radioresistant compared with NTCs (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. S7).
When exposed to 2 Gy, a dose commonly administered clinically during daily treatments of
breast cancer patients, 2.0-fold +/- 0.2 more CSC-enriched colonies survived than NTC
colonies. Next, we attempted to radioprotect NTCs by exposing them to the nitroxide
antioxidant tempol24. Pretreatment with tempol radioprotected NTCs, and resulted in survival
levels similar to those seen in the CSC-enriched population (Fig. 4c).
Given the overexpression of genes involved in GSH synthesis by CSCs, we wished to assess
the sensitivity of these cells to ROS elevation via pharmacologic depletion of GSH. Exposure
of Thy1+CD24+Lin- CSC-enriched cells to Buthionine Sulfoximine (BSO), which inhibits
glutamate-cysteine ligase25, decreased their colony forming ability by approximately three fold
(Fig. 4d). Finally, we asked if GSH depletion would radiosensitize CSCs. As shown in Fig. 4e,
BSO pretreatment of Thy1+CD24+Lin- CSC-enriched cells led to significant
radiosensitization. These data demonstrate the importance of low ROS levels and antioxidant
defenses to CSC survival and radiosensitivity in these tumors.

Our data indicate that normal breast stem cells and a subset of CSCs in some tumors arising
in both mice and humans contain lower levels of ROS than their cellular descendants. Taken
together with previous reports of low ROS concentrations in other normal tissue stem cells,
these findings suggest that stem cells in diverse systems have conserved this attribute, which
likely helps to protect their genomes from endogenous and exogenous ROS-mediated damage.
The mechanism leading to low ROS levels in some CSCs appears to be at least partially due
to the increased production of free radical scavengers. Notably, there appears to be significant
heterogeneity of ROS levels in both normal stem cell and CSC-enriched populations, which
could reflect that the enriched populations contain both stem and non-stem cells and/or that
ROS levels within stem cells can differ based on environmental factors that alter the balance
of endogenous production and the expression of scavenging pathways. The low ROS subset
found in the various stem cell populations may also represent a quiescent subpopulation.
Heterogeneity of ROS levels may influence the extent to which CSC-enriched populations are
resistant to therapies such as ionizing radiation.
In light of recent findings that CSCs in glioblastoma multiforme display enhanced DNA repair
capabilities19, it appears that CSCs may resist standard cytotoxic therapies through a

combination of mechanisms, and that these may be unique to a given tumor. In the case of
human CSCs, the frequency with which these cells display low ROS levels or enhanced DNA
repair remains to be determined, particularly since the normal transformation precursor may
be either stem or progenitor cells26, 27 and since ROS concentration (Fig. 1 and 5, 28) and
increased DNA repair capabilities appear to partially reflect differentiation state. Clinical
therapies could likely be optimized by patient- and tumor-specific identification of CSCresistance mechanisms and overcoming low ROS levels within CSCs may be a useful method
for improving local and systemic oncologic therapies.

Methods Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were analyzed, collected by FACS, and injected into recipient mice as described with
minor modifications from mouse mammary glands10, human breast29 cancers, human head
and neck30 cancers, and MMTV-Wnt-1 mouse tumors15. For human samples, informed consent
was obtained after approval of protocols by the Stanford University and City of Hope
Institutional Review Boards. For intracellular ROS analysis, cells were loaded with 10 μM
DCF-DA (Invitrogen), incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and immediately analyzed by flow
cytometry. Cells were re-sorted based on their level of DCF-DA staining for transplant
experiments. For MitoSOX Red experiments, cells were loaded with 5 uM MitoSOX Red at
37°C for 20 min. DNA damage was evaluated using the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay
under alkaline conditions17. For γ-H2AX immunostaining, purified cells were cytospun onto
poly-L-lysine coated slides, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with a phospho-specific (Ser
139) histone H2AX antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by a secondary Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen). For single cell gene expression analysis, cells
were sorted into 96 well plates containing CellsDirect qRT-PCR mix (Invitrogen). After
reverse transcription, genes were pre-amplified (22 cycles) using the same Taqman primers
(Applied Biosystems) used for quantification. Products were analyzed using qPCR
DynamicArray microfluidic chips (Fluidigm). For in vitro colony assays, cells were cultured
in Epicult B medium (StemCell Technologies) with 5% serum in the presence of ∼13,000
cm-2 irradiated NIH-3T3 cells. After 24-48 hrs, the media was replaced with serum-free Epicult
B, and colonies counted ∼7 days later. GSEA14 was performed using previously published
microarray data13 of CSCs and NTCs from primary breast tumor samples and a curated list of
ROS genes (Supplementary Table 4). Levels of significance were determined by Student's ttests using α=0.05.

Thy1+CD24+” Lin-cells

a, Single cell qRT-PCR analysis of gene expression in Thy1+CD24+Lin- CSC-enriched cells
and “Not Thy1+CD24+” Lin- non-tumorigenic cells. The heatmap displays mean centered
CT values. b, Clonogenic survival of Thy1+CD24+Lin- CSC-enriched cells and “Not
Thy1+CD24+” Lin- non-tumorigenic cells before and after 2 Gy of ionizing radiation. Mean ±
s.e.m. (n=3; p=0.001). c, Clonogenic survival of “Not Thy1+CD24+” Lin- non-tumorigenic
cells in the presence or absence of the ROS scavenger tempol (10 mM). Mean ± s.e.m. (n=2;
p=0.03). d, Clonogenic survival of Thy1+CD24+Lin- CSC-enriched cells in the presence or
absence of 24 hour pre-treatment with the glutathione synthesis inhibitor L-S,R-Buthionine
Sulfoximine (BSO, 1 mM). Mean ± s.e.m. (n=3; p=0.002). e, Clonogenic survival of
Thy1+CD24+Lin- CSC-enriched cells after 3 Gy of ionizing radiation with or without BSO
pretreatment. Mean ± s.e.m. (n=3; p=0.03).
