ABSTRACT
Accumulating evidence indicates that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the cause
of tumor drug/radio-resistance or distant metastasis; therefore, it is essential to
eliminate CSCs to cure cancer completely. The purpose of this study was to utilize
radioimmunotherapy (RIT) to target CD133(+) colonic CSCs and observe whether this
prevented tumor development, by assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
HCT116 tumor-bearing nude mice with escalating doses of 131I-AC133.1 monoclonal
antibody (mAb), and determining the therapeutic efficacy of RIT with 131I-AC133.1 mAb.
For RIT trials, animals were randomly divided into 4 groups of 6 per group, and injected
with 131I-AC133.1 mAb (16.65 MBq/100 μl), AC133.1 mAb (173.1 μg/100 μl), saline (100
μl), or unrelated IgG1 as an isotype control. Iodine-131 was radiolabeled to AC133.1
mAb by conjugation with N-succinimidyl 3-(tri-n-butylstannyl) benzoate. The MTD of
HCT116 tumor-bearing nude mice was 16.65 MBq. Both of the tumor volume doubling
time and the survival time of the 131I-AC133.1 mAb group were significant longer than
other groups (P < 0.001). CD133 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Protein
levels of cancer stem-like biomarkers (CD133, ALDH1, Lgr5, Vimentin, Snail1), and the
proliferative rate of 131I-AC133.1 mAb group were lower than other groups (P<0.001);
while its protein level of E-cadherin was higher than other groups. Furthermore, a
large proportion of tumor necrosis was also observed in the 131I-AC133.1 mAb group,
suggesting that RIT can destroy CSCs and effectively inhibit tumor development.

resistance, and the capacity to propagate tumors through
asymmetric cell division [7]. Since CSCs were firstly
isolated in acute myeloid leukemia [8], many CSCs of
solid tumors, including breast, brain, lung, colon cancers
as well as melanoma, have been identified [7]. Cell surface
markers have been intensively used to isolate and identify
CSCs, of which CD133 is frequently acknowledged as a
CSC marker. CD133, also known as Prominin-1, is a 120kDa cholesterol-interacting pentaspan-transmembrane
glycoprotein that belongs to the Prominin family [9]. CD133
was first reported to be a CSC marker for brain tumors by
Singh et al. [10, 11], following which O’Brien et al. [12]

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second and third
most common cancer worldwide in females and males,
respectively [1]. It has the fifth highest cancer mortality rate
in China and is the third leading cause of cancer death in the
United States [2, 3]. The five-year survival rate of CRC was
less than 70%, although neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has been
improved [4], failure of anti-cancer therapy is attributed to a
subpopulation of cells called cancer stem cells (CSCs) [5, 6].
CSCs play an important role in maintaining tumor
growth through their unlimited self-renewal, therapeutic

demonstrated that colonic CSCs within the CD133(+)
population have stem cell potential, allowing selfmaintenance and differentiation as well as reestablishing
tumor heterogeneity upon serial transplantation.
Eradication of CSCs is critical for improvement
in tumor prognosis [7, 13]. Various strategies have been
proposed to target CSCs, including an antigen-based
approach and inhibition of pathways related to selfrenewal, maintenance and drug resistance of CSCs [14].
The antigen based approach relies on specific markers
expressed on CSCs, with cognate antibody conjugated
to drugs such as 5-Fluorouracil or radionuclide which
could enhance the therapeutic effect of antibody-based
immunotherapy alone. Jandal et al. [15] used 188Re-labeled
anti-melanin monoclonal antibody (mAb) 6D2 for the
treatment of mice bearing A2058 melanoma xenograft,
indicating a similar rate of killing of melanoma stem
cells and bulk cells. Then, Leyton et al. [16] utilized
a radiolabeled antibody to target leukemia stem cells
directly, demonstrating that high dose radioimmunotherapy
(RIT) reduced leukemia stem cell viability and impaired
self-renewal. Moreover, AI-Ejeh et al. [17] reported that
177
Lu labeled anti-EGFR mAb alone significantly reduced
the percentage of CD44(+)/CD24(-)/EpCAM(+) breast
CSCs, especially when combined with chemotherapy and
a poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor. These findings
suggest RIT has a potential advantage for targeting CSCs.
To date, two products, Zevalin (90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan)
and Bexxar (131I-tositumomab) have been approved for the
treatment of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma in the clinic.
Beta (β)-emitters are commonly used for RIT based
on their unique characteristics: radiolabeled antibodies
conjugated to β-emitters can kill surrounding cells by
a bystander “cross-fire” effect, which is independent of
the expression of the target antigen or the sensitivity of
the cells to chemotherapeutic drugs [18]. The physical

properties of iodine-131 (131I) have allowed it to be
widely used for RIT. However, dehalogenation is the
main drawback of antibody radioiodination using the
Iodogen method [19], which can decrease the stability of
labeled antibody in vivo and cause radioactive damage
to the thyroid. A potential factor contributing to the
dehalogenation of proteins in vivo is the recognition of
labeled iodophenyl groups on the protein by deiodiases
known to be involved in the metabolism of thyroid
hormones [20]. Santous et al. [21] verified that retention
labeling such as N-succinimidyl 3-(tri-n-butylstannyl)
benzoate (ATE) method have a fast blood clearance,
better target organ/background relation and low uptake in
the thyroid and stomach compared with the direct labeling
method. Our previous work utilized 131I labeled AC133.1
mAb to trace CD133(+) colonic CSCs in vivo [22], which
established a foundation for RIT of CSCs. In this study,
we attempted to target CD133(+) colonic CSCs with RIT.

RESULTS
MAb characterization
The retention time of N-succinimidyl 3-[131I]
iodobenzoate (131I-SIB) was approximately 11.0 min (data
not shown), and generated about 88.0% yield and 60.4
to 76.6% of this intermediate was coupled to AC133.1
mAb following a 30 min reaction at room temperature
(RT). The radiospecific activity of 131I-AC133.1 mAb was
77.70 KBq/μg to 96.20 KBq/μg, Scatchard analyses of the
binding data revealed that the equilibrium dissociation
constant KD for AC133.1 mAb was (4.76 ± 0.30) × 10-8 M,
and the nonspecific binding was less than 2%.
The radiochemical purity of the labeled antibody
was 94.05 ± 1.53% and it was 87.64 ± 0.33% at day 7 in
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Figure 1).

difference in tumor volume and weight of tumor-bearing
nude mice were not statistically significant between the
groups. From the results of tumor growth curve (Figure
2A), we conducted the tumor volume doubling time
(VDT) of the four groups. A statistically significant
difference was observed for tumor VDT between the 131IAC133.1 mAb group and other three groups (P<0.001),
with a value of 9.36 ± 0.45 days for the 131I-AC133.1 mAb
group, and 6.29 ±0.78 days, 6.42 ± 0.35 days and 6.89 ±
0.30 days for saline, 131I-IgG1 and AC133.1 mAb groups,
respectively. There were no significant differences among
the other groups (P=0.071). From the survival curve
(Figure 2B), we calculated the median survival time of
each group, and they were 44.0 d, 27.8 d, 29.4 d, 32.6 d
for 131I-AC133.1 mAb, Saline, 131I-IgG1, AC133.1 mAb
groups, respectively; and the survival time of 131I-AC133.1
mAb group was longer than the other groups (P < 0.001),

For the doses 7.40, 9.25, 11.10, 12.95 and 14.80
MBq, there were no related deaths or loss of weight
exceeding 20% of its initial. At the 16.65 MBq dose,
two mice showed temporary weight loss in the first two
weeks, but this did not exceed 20%. There was one case
of discomfort and weight loss exceeding 20% at day 18 at
a dosage of 18.50 MBq. However, for the doses of 20.35
and 22.20 MBq, animals were showed weight loss greater
than 20% or death within 20 d. Based on these results,
we determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
HCT116 bearing-nude mice was 16.65 MBq.

Therapeutic response
Initial tumor sizes at the time of treatment ranged
from 33.07 ± 4.94 mm3 (diameter ~4 mm), but the

the other groups, while the level of E-cadherin was higher
(Figure 4). Ki67 analysis showed reduced proliferative
index in the 131I-AC133.1 mAb group (9.52 ± 1.33%),
whereas the 131I-IgG1, AC133.1 mAb, saline groups had
significantly higher proliferative indices (37.46 ± 3.72%,
32.60 ± 2.88%, 45.56 ± 3.52%, respectively) (P<0.001)
(Figure 5). H&E staining of tumor tissues showed a large
necrotic area in tumors from the 131I-AC133.1 mAb group;
however, no obvious necrosis was observed in the controls
(Figure 6).

Biodistribution measurement and radiation
dosimetry
The highest ratio of tumor/thyroid was 19.12 ±
3.21 at day 7, which was higher compared with our
previous study using the Iodogen method. Nontarget
organs such as muscle, bone, gastrointestinal, lungs, and
heart all maintained low levels of 131I-AC133.1 mAb.
From the biodistribution data (Table 1), we calculated
the accumulated radiation dosimetry of tumor in
131
I-AC133.1mAb group to be 5,966.34 ± 54.90 cGy.

DISCUSSION
In this study, AC133.1 mAb was radioiodinated by
the ATE method and showed satisfactory characteristics.
The 131I-AC133.1 mAb was utilized to target CD133(+)
colorectal CSCs, and analysis of the therapeutic effect
(tumor VDT, median survival time, CD133 expression
by flow cytometry, protein levels of cancer stem-like
biomarkers, Ki67 and H&E staining of tumors) suggested
that 131I-AC133.1 mAb could destroy CSCs and inhibit
tumor development.
There is an urgent need to eliminate CSCs based on
their critical role in tumor relapse and distant metastasis
after therapy; however, conventional therapeutics have
no effect on CSCs due to their chemo/radio-resistance.
Therefore, some studies have attempted to target CSCs
with RIT. Jandl et al. [15] utilized an 188Re-6D2 antibody

Flow cytometry, western blot (WB), hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) and Ki67 staining
CD133 expression in the 131I-AC133.1mAb group

0.001) (Figure 3), and there were no significant differences
among the controls (P=0.244). Protein levels cancer stemlike biomarkers (CD133, ALDH1, Lgr5, E-cadherin,

expression of CD133, ALDH1, Lgr5, Vimentin and

to target mice bearing A2058 melanoma xenografts,
showing RIT killed the melanoma stem cells at the same
rate as the other tumor cells. Later, Leyton et al. [23]
applied 111In labeled anti-CD123 mAb, CSL360, modified
with nuclear translocation sequence peptides to study the
acute myeloid leukemia engraftment assay in the prevalent
NOD/SCID mouse, demonstrating a significant decrease in
CD123(+) leukemic stem cells and impaired self-renewal
was achieved with high doses of RIT. Both experiments
suggested that RIT may be a useful therapeutic modality
for eradicating CSCs. To target CSCs, a good CSCs
marker is required.
To date, many cell surface markers including
CD133, CD44, EpCAM, CD24, CD29, Lgr5, CD166,
Sox2, and Oct4, either separately or in combination,
have been used to identify colorectal CSCs [9, 24–26];
however, CD133 is the most frequently used. O’Brien et
al. [12] and Lucia et al. [27] foundthatcolonic CSCs were
enriched in CD133(+) cells and that their tumorigenic
ability was higher than that of CD133(-) cells, indicating
CD133 could be used as a useful biomarker for colonic

CSCs. Our previous study utilized 131I-AC133.1 mAb to
trace CD133(+) colonic CSCs successfully in vivo [22],
which laid a solid foundation for the use of RIT to target
CD133(+) colonic CSCs with radioiodinated compounds.
For radioiodination mAb, it is generally assumed
that the loss of radioiodine from these proteins following
their in vivo administration can be attributed to the action
of dehalogenases normally involved in the metabolism of
thyroid hormones [20], thus affecting the stability of the
radiolabeled antibody in vivo. However, using retention
labeling such as ATE method can avoid dehalogenation
[19, 28]. ATE contains an active ester that can be combined
with 131I quickly; the labeling rate of 131I-SIB was about
88.5%, which allows the intermediate to conjugate
with AC133.1 mAb under appropriate conditions. The
radiochemistry purity of 131I-AC133.1 mAb was 94.05 ±
1.53%, and was 87.64 ± 0.33% in FBS at day 7, indicating
the radiolabeled compound was relatively stable. In a cell
saturated assay, the equilibrium dissociation KD was (4.76
± 0.30) × 10-8 M, revealing the radiolabeled antibody had
a good affinity for its antigen. The radiospecific activity

of labeled antibody was 77.70 KBq/μg to 96.20 KBq/μg,
which was lower than our previous report using Iodogen
method [22], as the ATE method involved a two-step
reaction. Its enhanced characteristics in vitro indicated the
feasible use of RIT in vivo with 131I-AC133.1 mAb.
To choose an appropriate dosage, we performed
MTD assay by assessing the health status and weight
of mice. The initial dose of MTD experiment was 7.40
MBq escalating in 1.85 MBq intervals, to a final dose of
22.20 MBq. None of the mice loss of weight exceeds 20%
of its initial or died within 30 days, up to and including
a dose of 16.65 MBq. However, at least one of these
events emerged over a dose exceeding 16.65 MBq. We
thus determined the MTD to be 16.65 MBq. For RIT
experiments, the initial tumor volume was 33.06 ± 4.98
mm3 with a diameter of ~4 mm. This diameter was chosen
because the tissue penetration of 131I is less than 3 mm
[29, 30], and our preliminary experiments demonstrated
that the radiolabeled mAb had no obvious effect on tumor
development if its initial volume was too large. Generally,
RIT plays a role mainly dependent on the following
effects: antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),
antigen-antibody complexes activating the complement
pathway, and the killing effect of radionuclide for the
targets. Radiotherapy causes DNA damage directly by

ionization or indirectly via the generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), therapy destroying the targets.
As 131I-AC133.1 mAb could destroy CD133(+) CSCs
specifically, the CD133 expression was confirmed by flow
cytometry and the protein level of CD133 in 131I-AC133.1
mAb group were found to be lower than in the control
groups. The percentage of CSCs was reduced, resulting
in slowed tumor growth, reduced proliferative index,
and longer VDT and survival time, thus supporting our
hypothesis. Moreover, the protein level of other stem-like
markers were tested, the expression of Lgr5, ALDH1,
Vimentin and Snail1 in 131I-AC133.1 mAb group were
lower than other observed in the other groups, while
the level of E-cadherin was higher, as the expression of
E-cadherin is negatively correlated with tumor invasion
and metastasis. There was no obvious therapeutic effect in
the AC133.1 mAb group; one of the reasons for this may
be that in the BALB/c nude mouse model, the effect of
ADCC alone was so weak that it could not inhibit tumor
development.
To calculate the radiation dosimetry, we performed
biodistribution experiments. The highest ratio of tumor/
thyroid tissue was 19.12 ± 3.27 at day 7, which was
higher than our previous report using the Iodogen method
[22], verifying the ATE method has a better stability in

vivo. A sufficient radiation dose delivered to the tumor is
important for the curative effect, and tumor responses will
depend on the amount of tissue being irradiated as well as
the radiation sensitivity of the tissue, because solid tumors
typically require 3,500-10,000 cGy for a meaningful
response [31], consistent with our result (5,966.34 ± 54.90
cGy).
A number of biomarkers of colorectal CSCs have
been identified, and it is thought that only a small subset
of CD133(+) cells were colorectal CSCs. CD133 is a
commonly used colorectal CSC marker, and can be
used in combination with other markers to screen the
purity of CSCs. Haraguchi et al. [32] identified cancer
initiating cells were more likely to be from a CD133(+)
CD44(+) population compared with CD133(+) or
CD44(+) cells alone. For RIT, the therapeutic effect was
highly relevant to the radionuclide. 131I has a low linear
energy transfer (LET = 0.1-1.0 kev/μm), thus producing
non-specific exposure to normal organs as a result of the
cross-fire effect. Alpha particles have high linear energy
transfer, and lethal effect does not rely completely on
tissue oxygen; thus is has been commonly used for
RIT in recent years [33–35]. Furthermore, the poor
pharmacokinetic properties caused by the high molecular
weight of mAbs (~150kDa) limits the effects of RIT;
however, progress in genetic engineering antibody,
and strategies including pretargeted technology [29],
fractionated RIT [31, 36], and RIT combination with
other therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy, mAb
based biotherapy, and customized radiolabeled antibody
cocktails might enhance the effect of RIT [37–42]. In
conclusion, our results indicate that mAb-conjugated
RIT successfully retards tumor progression, while
enhancing median survival time by targeting CD133(+)
CSCs in a mouse model of colon cancer.

ATE was synthesized according to a previous
report [43]. For this procedure, 0.9 μl ATE was placed
into a reaction vial fitted with a septum containing 100
μl 1% HOAC/MeOH, 10 μl N-chlorosuccinimide in
MeOH, and 10 μl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
The desired quantity of Na131I was added (about 38.48
MBq), and after 10 min at RT the reaction was quenched
by the addition of 10 μl of 0.72 mg/ml aqueous solution
of NaHSO3 solution. The intermediate product, 131I-SIB,
was purified by sepax positive-phase semipreparative
column (HPLC), and 131I-SIB was dried by N2. Then, 50
μl of AC133.1 mAb was dissolved in 50 μl borate buffer
(pH = 8.7) and then added into the above dried 131I-SIB
at RT for 30 min with constant shaking. The reaction was
terminated by the addition of 300 μl of 0.2 M glycine. The
crude radiolabeled compound was purified by a sephadex
G-25 column using PBS as the eluent.

Equilibrium dissociation constant determination
The equilibrium dissociation constant for the labeled
AC133.1 mAb preparations to HCT116 were determined
using a cell-saturated assay. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells/well were
grown to confluence in 12-well plates, serial dilutions
of each labeled AC133.1 mAb preparations were added
to each well in triplicate after 150 μl 1% BSA/PBS was
added in advance and incubated for 30 min, and then coincubated at 37°C for 4 h. The wells were washed 3 times
with 1% BSA/PBS and 0.1 M NaOH solution was used
to crack cells. The supernatant was collected, precipitated
separately and radioactivity measured using an automated
γ counter. Non-specific cell binding was determined by
adding 500-fold unlabeled AC133.1 mAb, incubated
for 30 min and then adding the above labeled AC133.1
mAb. The percentage of specific binding was calculated
by subtracting the nonspecific binding from total binding.
Equilibrium dissociation constants were analyzed using a
computer program.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
All animal procedures were performed according to
a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of HuaZhong University of Science and
Technology.

Serum stability
I-AC133.1 mAb was mixed with an appropriate
volume FBS at 4°C, and the radiochemical purity was
calculated at different time points (0, 1, 3, and 7 d).

Mab and cells

Tumor model

AC133.1 mAb preparations were produced
from ascites grown from BALB/c mice that received
intraperitoneal injections of the appropriate hybridoma
(HB-12346). AC133.1 mAb is an IgG1 murine monoclonal
antibody purified by protein A/G. HCT116 cells were
purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, grown in RPMI1640 and cultured in medium
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2.

Male athymic mice (nu/nu genotype, BALB/c
background) of at least 8 weeks of age and weighing
20–24 g were purchased from the Beijing HuaFuKang
Company (Beijing, China). The HCT116 colonic tumor
model was established by the injection of 2 × 106 cells
in 100 μl PBS into the lower right limbs. Tumor volumes
were calculated as
(short dimension)2 × long dimension/2

Animals were randomized by tumor volume, and
therapeutic trials were initiated when the tumor diameter
was approximately 4 mm.

absorbed dose in rads (cGy) received by tumor was
calculated by multiplying its cumulative activity by the
equilibrium absorbed dose constant (0.4313 g-rad/μci-h)
of 131I [28]. Because of the low absorbed fractions of 131I
γ-rays in small tissues such as those in BALB/c athymic
mice, the dose due to γ exposure was not included.

RIT experiments
Two therapy studies were performed using 131IAC133.1 mAb. The first therapy study was designed to
assess the MTD in HCT116-bearing nude mice. The MTD,
corresponding to the highest dose at which weight loss
did not exceed 20% of initial weight, was determined by
monitoring the weight and health status of tumor-bearing
nude mice injected intravenously with increasing doses of
131
I-AC133.1 mAb. Nine groups were treated with 7.40,
9.25, 11.10, 12.95, 14.80, 16.65, 18.50, 20.35 or 22.20
131
I-AC133.1 mAb, respectively (each dose was tested
in six mice). Because organ damage may not develop
immediately, animals were monitored for an addition
30 days. The second experiment studied the therapeutic
efficacy of RIT (six mice per group). To ensure therapeutic
efficacy, the 131I-AC133.1 mAb group received the MTD
in a volume of 100 μl. For the AC133.1 mAb group, the
amount of antibody was calculated from the radiospecific
activity of the radiolabeled compound. Unrelated IgG1
was used as the isotype control. Animals were housed
individually, and bedding was changed at 48 h and 96
h and twice weekly to reduce nonspecific background
exposure. Tumor sizes were measured every 4–5 days
and health status was observed daily. Mice in the RIT
trials were excluded when weight loss exceeded 20% of
starting weight, or the tumor volume was greater than
750 mm3 [44].
An antitumor effect was expressed as tumor VDT,
which was calculated using the following equation: VDT
= (T−T0) × log2/log (V/V0), where T−T0 indicates the
length of time between two measurements and V0 and V
denote the tumor volume at two points of measurements
[45]. In addition, survival curves were constructed.

Flow cytometry, western blot, H&E, and ki67
staining
For flow cytometry, marginal tumor tissues not
including necrotic tissues or blood streaks were sheared,
washed three times with saline, cut into slices, digested with
collagenase IV for 1 h at 37°C, filtered through a 70-μm
screen mesh, then resuspended as a monolayer suspension.
Then, 3 μl APC-CD133/1(MiltenyiBiotec) was added and
incubated at 4°C for 30 min, centrifuged for 5 min at 110
g, and then resuspended in 300 μl PBS for sample testing.
After sacrificing the mice, the tumor tissues were
removed immediately and ground completely. After
centrifugation (400 × g, 4°C) for 5 min, the supernatant was
collected to quantify the protein using the Bradford protein
assay kit (Thermo Fisher). Protein was separated by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then
electroblotted onto a polyvinylidenedifluoride membrane
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was
incubated with mAb (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany) overnight at 4°C. β-actin was used as a control.
Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
For H&E staining, tumor tissues were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10–12 h, embedded in paraffin,
passed through a serial process of dewaxing, dyeing,
hydration and drying.
For Ki67 staining, an antigen retrieval kit from
MiltenyiBiotec was used according to the manufacturer’s
specifications. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with
3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS and incubated with aproteinblocking solution containing PBS (pH 7.5). Samples were
incubated with a 1:200 dilution of Ki67, incubated in
diaminobenzidine, mounted on glass slides with cover slips.

Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry
Tissue distribution studies were initiated when the
mean tumor diameter reached 0.8-1.0 cm and mice were
then injected intravenously with about 7.40 MBq 131IAC133.1 mAb. On days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 after injection,
groups of 4 animals were euthanized, and tissues
(including blood, tumor, muscle, femoral bone, spleen,
kidney, liver, stomach, large intestine, lung, heart, thyroid,
brain) were obtained and weighed. Results are expressed
as a percentage of the injected dose. The radiation
absorbed dose was calculated from the biodistribution
data, and the percentage injected dose per gram (% ID/g)
value was corrected for the radiation decay of 131I and
converted to μci/g. The cumulative activity in tumors (μcih/g) was calculated from the area under the resultant μci/g
curves using the trapezoid integration method. A uniform
distribution of 131I in tissues was assumed. The radiation

Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation (SD) or percentage when appropriate. All data
were analyzed with the One-way ANOVA or nonparametric
tests (Mann–Whitney U-test for comparison of 2 groups and
the Kruskal–Wallis test for comparison of multiple groups).
Survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves. P <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
