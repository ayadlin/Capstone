ABSTRACT
The global methylation profile and the mutational status of 633 specific epigenetic
regulators were analyzed in the pediatric tumor clear cell sarcoma of the kidney
(CCSK). Methylation array analyses of 30 CCSKs revealed CCSK tumor DNA to be
globally hypermethylated compared to Wilms tumor, normal fetal kidney, and adult
kidney. The aberrant methylation pattern of CCSKs was associated with activation of
genes involved in embryonic processes and with silencing of genes linked to normal
kidney function. No epigenetic regulator was recurrently mutated in our cohort, but
a mutation in the key epigenetic regulator EZH2 was discovered in one case. EZH2
mRNA was significantly higher in CCSK compared to Wilms tumor and normal kidney,
and the EZH2 protein was strongly expressed in more than 90 % of CCSK tumor cells
in 9/9 tumors analyzed. This was in striking contrast to the lack of EZH2 protein
expression in Wilms tumor stromal elements, indicating that EZH2 could be explored
further as a diagnostic marker and a potential drug target for CCSK.

those carrying the YWHAE-NUTM2B/E fusion [6, 7]. On
the other hand, a comprehensive molecular characterization
of a small set of CCSKs failed to detect any somatic genetic
variants [8], reinforcing the consideration that CCSKs are
relatively quiescent also at the DNA sequence level.
We previously reported that CCSK likely emerges
from embryonic mesenchymal progenitor cells at an
earlier stage of nephrogenic differentiation than the
cells giving rise to WT [3]. Interestingly, BCOR has
been shown to have a prominent role in the maintenance
of differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells through
epigenetic mechanisms [9]. BCOR is a component of the
non-canonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) [10,
11], which marks histones for the recruitment of polycomb
repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-complexes [12]. BCOR has
also been shown to affect local histone acetylation and
methylation states as well as DNA methylation [13, 14].
The role of BCOR as an epigenetic regulator together with
the striking paucity of large genomic imbalances, and the
few detected somatic mutations suggests that the primitive

INTRODUCTION
Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) is the
second commonest pediatric renal cancer, surpassed only
by Wilms tumor (WT) [1]. WT and CCSK most often affect
children younger than 5 years. CCSKs are more prone to
form metastases than WT, particularly to brain and bone
and are hence treated according to high-risk protocols,
including combinations of traditional chemotherapeutic
substances. There is therefore an urgent need for more
specific treatment modalities, associated with fewer side
effects [1]. CCSKs typically display a normal karyotype
even when subjected to high-resolution genome array
analysis [2, 3]. A subgroup of CCSKs has been shown
to contain specific gene fusions including YWHAENUTM2B/E and IRX2-TERT [4, 5], but these fusions
are rare and their clinical implications remain unknown.
Recently, targeted sequencing showed that an internal
tandem duplication (ITD) in exon 16 of the BCOR gene,
is present in the majority of CCSKs, while typically not in

mesenchymal expression profile of CCSK results mainly
from epigenetic dysregulation.
Here we explore the epigenetic profile of CCSK by
analyzing the DNA methylation pattern of 30 cases and the
mutational status of 633 epigenetic regulators in 22 cases
of this tumor. We find that CCSK exhibits a characteristic
DNA methylation profile, but fail to find mutations of
epigenetic regulator genes. Interestingly, we found a high
expression of the key epigenetic regulator protein EZH2
in all CCSKs tested, which could have future clinical
implications.

CCSK displays a distinct global DNA
methylation profile
Array-based DNA-methylation analysis revealed
that the global methylation profile of CCSKs was
clearly distinct from WTs as well as non-neoplastic
fetal and adult kidneys (Figure 1A). The two tumors
(CCSK11 and CCSK29) previously shown to harbor
the YWHAE-NUTM2B/E fusion [7] clustered with the

DNA methylation (0.05 variance ratio, 15051 variables) of 30 CCSKs, 17 WTs, 6 adult kidneys (AK), and 2 fetal kidneys (FK). Four of
the CCSKs and two WTs, AKs, and FKs were analyzed in duplicates on different arrays. CCSK11 and CCSK29 harbor the YWHAENUTM2B/E fusion transcript. B and C.

fusion negative and BCOR ITD positive tumors, in the
principal component analysis (PCA) plot. WTs clustered
together with normal kidneys, and their methylation
status resembled fetal kidney to a greater extent than
adult kidney. Overall DNA methylation, as reflected
by the median beta-value for all probes, was higher in
CCSK than in the other sample sets. Separate analyses
of the methylation status of CpGs situated in or outside
of CpG islands (Figure 1B and 1C), revealed that it was
CpGs located within CpG islands that were significantly
hypermethylated in CCSK compared to WT (p-value
= 2.3x10-9), adult kidney (p-value = 5.7 x10-6), and
fetal kidney (p-value 0.0001; Figure 1B). There was
no significant difference between mean methylation
levels of CpGs located outside CpG islands in CCSK
and non-neoplastic kidneys (Figure 1C), indicating that
the aberrant hypermethylation of CCSKs is confined to
CpG islands.
We then established which methylated gene
regions primarily discriminated between CCSK on
the one hand, and normal kidney or WT on the other
(Figure 1D and 1E). As expected, the majority of these
differentially methylated CpGs displayed a higher
beta-value in CCSK. Of the 25 most differentially
methylated regions, eight genes (TP73, GJB2, ABTB1,
DGK1, PAOX, MARC1, AIFM2 and TOMM20L) were
hypermethylated in CCSK in comparison with both
normal kidney and WT (Figure 1D and 1E). Gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that 241
pathways were significantly over-represented among
the hypermethylated genes in CCSK compared to WT,
adult kidney, and fetal kidney, while no gene sets were
significantly over-represented amongst hypomethylated
genes in CCSK compared to WT. Hypermethylated
genes in CCSK were most significantly associated
with biological pathways involved in cell adhesion,
anatomical structure morphogenesis, organ development,
and cell migration (Table 1 and Supplementary Table
1). Corresponding pathways were enriched if the CCSK
methylation profile was compared to normal kidney
or WT separately (data not shown), in line with the
similarities in methylation profile of these tissue types
(Figure 1A). Hypermethylated genes in WT, fetal or
adult kidney did not significantly correlate with any gene
set irrespective of comparison group (data not shown).

CpGs were significantly (p< 0.01) hypermethylated
in CCSK in 3777 unique genes (Figure 2A and 2B)
and 2590 CpGs localised to 2157 unique genes were
hypomethylated (Figure 2C and 2D).
The gene expression patterns of the extracted
hyper- and hypomethylated genes were investigated
with gene expression array. This showed an enrichment
for genes involved in embryonic development and organ
formation amongst those with high expression in CCSK
irrespective of whether the expression was associated
with hypermethylation in CCSK as exemplified HES6,
CDH4, ASCL2, GLI2, EN2, LRP8, and CTNND2 (Figure
2A) or hypomethylation e.g. PITX1, NPTX2, LHX2,
NKX3, ZIC2, SLIT2, NTRK3, ONECUT2, and EPHB1
(Figure 2C). Among genes where high methylation was
linked to a silenced gene expression in CCSK, there was
an enrichment of genes associated with normal kidney
formation (AQP2 and UMOD) and genes typically
expressed by epithelial cells (EPCAM, SCNN1A, CLDN8,
and CDH16) (Figure 2B). Genes with low methylation
and low expression in CCSK were not associated with any
specific signaling pathway (Figure 2D).

Absence of recurrent mutations in epigenetic
regulators in CCSK
To investigate a possible underlying mechanism
behind the unique signature of DNA hypermethylation
in CCSK, we used our previously published RNAsequencing data from 22 of these tumors [4] to
screen for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 633
genes previously identified as epigenetic regulators
[15]. No genes were recurrently mutated, but exonic
nonsynonymous variants were identified in 14 genes
in 50% (11/22) of the analyzed tumors, all of which
were verified by deep DNA sequencing (Table 2). As
we called variants using RNA-sequencing data and had
no paired normal samples, we employed strict criteria
for calling variants (see Materials and Methods for
details). The mutation in CCSK21 in EZH2 was the only
variant previously reported in the COSMIC database
(COSM52996) [16].

EZH2 is highly expressed in CCSK
When investigating the gene expression level of
the 633 epigenetic regulators using gene expression
array data, we found the key epigenetic regulator EZH2
to be significantly higher expressed in CCSKs compared
to WTs, fetal kidneys, and adult kidneys (Figure 3A).
EZH2 was highly expressed in CCSKs irrespective of
whether the tumour harboured the BCOR-ITD or the
YWHAE-NUTM2B/E fusion transcript (not shown). The
median EZH2-expression levels were similar between
WTs and fetal kidneys, while adult kidneys displayed
the lowest EZH2-expression. The protein expression of

The aberrant methylation pattern in CCSK
is linked to activation of embryonic genes and
silencing of genes important for kidney function
and epithelialization
To monitor the potential functional effects of
the unique DNA methylation signature of CCSK, we
identified genes with differential mRNA expression that
localized to hypo/hypermethylated regions in CCSK
compared to adult and fetal kidney (Figure 2). 5022

EZH2 was strong and diffuse (>90% positive cells) in
9/9 CCSKs analyzed (Figure 3E and 3F). All round or
spindle shaped tumor cells strongly expressed EZH2,
in contrast to the cells in the fibrous septa and the
vasculature of the tumors, which were EZH2-negative.
Adjacent normal kidney tissue was EZH2-negative
(Figure 3C and 3D), with only occasional EZH2-positive
cells in renal tubules.
In WT, the protein expression of EZH2 differed
between the different histological components (Figure 3B,
3G, and 3H). The stromal component stained negative/weak
(<10% positive cells) in 26 of the 27 WTs with stromal
areas represented. Widespread stromal expression was

detected only in an unusual WT with anaplastic stromal
histology (not shown). Twenty-four of the WTs analyzed
harbored epithelial components, and the majority of the
tumors were EZH2-positive in 10-90% of these epithelial
cells. Two different staining patterns were detected for the
23 WTs analyzed which contained blastemal components;
EZH2 was positive in 10-90% of the blastemal cells in 7
cases (Figure 3G), while almost all (>90% positive cells)
blastemal cells were strongly and diffusely positive in 14
of the tumors (Figure 3H). As an incidental observation, we
noted that none of the WT patients with <90% blastemal
EZH2 positivity died from their disease, while 7 out of the
14 patients with widespread blastemal EZH2 - positivity

were dead of disease or complications (Supplementary
Table 2). This suggests a possible correlation between diffuse
blastemal EZH2 protein expression and less favorable
prognosis (p = 0.0189, Fisher’s exact test).
Analogous to the findings in WTs, fetal kidney
showed an expression of the EZH2 protein, indicative
of a role in early nephrogenic elements. The expression
was widespread at gestational week 12-13 (Figure 3I),
but became specific for epithelial structures in the more
differentiated kidney from gestational week 19-20
(Figure 3J).

It is well established that an aberrant
hypermethylation of tumor DNA can be caused by
mutations in epigenetic modifiers such as IDH1, IDH2,
TET1, TET2, and SDH-subunits [18, 19]. Hence we
analyzed RNA sequencing data from a previous study
[2] to search for mutations in 633 genes identified as
epigenetic regulators with some of them commonly
mutated in pediatric tumors [15]. We did identify
deleterious mutations in 50% of tumors analyzed, but no
gene was recurrently mutated in our panel of tumors. Due
to the lack of non-malignant material from the patients, we
cannot rule out the possibility that some of the identified
aberrations are rare constitutional variants. On the other
hand, our findings make it unlikely that other recurrent
driver mutations besides the BCOR-ITD are present in
CCSK.
We discovered a previously reported deleterious
mutation in EZH2 (COSM52996) in one of the tumors
and we also found high expression of EZH2 in CCSK at
both mRNA and protein levels. EZH2 is overexpressed
in several solid tumor types, and high expression is
correlated with aggressive disease in specific cancers
[20]. High expression of EZH2 has been demonstrated
in small cell lung cancer, another tumor characterized
by hypermethylation of promoter regions [21]. EZH2 is
an epigenetic regulator and is the catalytic subunit of the
PRC2 which methylates histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27).
The trimethylated form of this complex represses gene
expression during differentiation and development [22].
EZH2 also has a PRC2-independent function and can
activate expression of cell cycle associated genes such as

DISCUSSION
In summary, we found that CCSKs display a
distinct DNA methylation profile compared to WT and
normal kidney tissue. The global methylation pattern of
the WTs on the other hand was similar to non-neoplastic
kidney, especially fetal kidney. Specifically, CpGs
localized to CpG islands were aberrantly methylated in
CCSK. Previous studies have indicated that CCSKs are
characterized by disturbed embryonic signaling pathways
[3, 17]. In the present study, we found a clear link between
the aberrant DNA methylation pattern in CCSK and the
expression of genes important in embryonic pathways and
cellular organization. This indicates that the characteristic
gene expression pattern of CCSK is, at least in part,
determined by the methylation of specific genes. Together
with the recent finding of a recurrent BCOR-ITD in CCSK
[6], our data highlights the significance of epigenetic
dysregulation in CCSK.

CCND1 [23], which is in line with the high expression
of cyclin D1 previously observed in CCSK [24]. The
expression of EZH2 has previously been shown to
decrease upon kidney maturation in the mouse fetal
kidney [25]. We noted a parallel pattern in the human
fetal kidney; EZH2 was broadly expressed at the earliest
investigated time point (gestational week 12-13), but was
confined to the ureteric bud and to primitive glomerular
structures in the more mature kidney (gestational week
19-20).
Together with the recently identified frequent
BCOR mutations in CCSK [6], our data underscore
that epigenetic dysregulation is central to CCSK
pathogenesis. An interesting avenue to explore would be

a potential connection between the BCOR-ITD and EZH2
overexpression, and their potential roles in the global
hypermethylation of CCSK reported in the current paper.
The lack of EZH2 expression in WT stromal elements
renders EZH2 a candidate diagnostic marker to distinguish
stromal type WT from CCSK. It is also interesting that
strong and diffuse expression of EZH2 in the blastemal
compartment correlates with poor prognosis in WT, but
these data requires validation in a larger patient cohort.
Our findings of high EZH2 protein expression in all
investigated CCSKs could be of potential therapeutic
interest, considering the recent emergence of several
EZH2 inhibitors, with promising anti-tumorigenic effects
[20, 21, 26].

Probes monitoring non-autosomal loci were removed
to adjust for gender differences prior to data analyses.
The methylation data are available at the NCBI’s Gene
Expression Omnibus database, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/, accession number GSE73187.

Tumor and kidney samples
The study was reviewed and approved by the
regional ethics committee (L119-03) and by the review
boards of the participating institutes. Frozen tissue from
CCSKs was obtained from Children’s Oncology Group
(COG) of North America, and from Skåne University
Hospital, Lund, Sweden. WTs were from Skåne
University Hospital and from the Academic Medical
Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. See supplementary
Tables 1 and 2 for clinical data. CCSK tissue sections
were acquired from Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital,
Crumlin Dublin 12, Ireland and from Skåne Regional
and University Laboratories, Lund, Sweden. Frozen nonneoplastic kidney tissue was obtained from the biobank at
the Department of Pathology at Lund University (Ethics
Approval L2012-405). DNA from human fetal kidneys
were acquired from BioChain, Hayward, CA.

Descriptive analyses on methylation and gene
expression data
Dendrograms were generated using hierarchical
clustering (R function hclust), with Euclidean distance as
the distance metric. Boxplots were done for each tumor
type using the per sample mean. Student’s t-test was used
to assess whether there was a significant difference in
mean methylation between groups. PCA and hierarchical
clustering (HCL) with heat maps displaying the
methylation and gene expression levels for the individual
samples were done with Qlucore Omics Explorer Software
v3.0 (Qlucore AB, Lund, Sweden). Each variable was
normalized to mean 0 and variance 1. HCL was done using
the Euclidean metric and the Average linkage criteria.
Gene expression array data were log2-transformed prior
to analyses.
The correlation of hyper- or hypomethylated genes
in CCSK to specific signaling pathways was investigated
by GSEA with the c5.bp.v5.0.symbols.gmt file http://
www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/msigdb according to the
manufacturer’s instructions [29].

Methylation array
The global methylation profile of 30 CCSKs, 17
WTs, six samples from adult kidneys, and two human
fetal kidneys were analyzed by methylation array. Four of
the CCSKs and two of the WTs, as well as adult kidneys
and fetal kidneys were analyzed in technical duplicates
(Supplementary Table 3). DNA was extracted from
fresh frozen tissue with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations, and subjected to bisulfite conversion
with the EZ DNA methylation kit. DNA was hybridized to
the Infinium HumanMethylation27 Bead array (Illumina)
at the Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund
University (SCIBLU) according to standard procedures.
This array covers 27,578 individual CpG sites in 14,495
genes. The majority of the reporters (20,006) correspond
to CpGs located in CpG-islands. The remaining 7,572
reporters correspond to CpG loci that do not meet the
CpG island criteria according to Takai and Jones [27].
The methylation value for each CpG, the beta-value,
was calculated as the ratio between the signal intensity
detected by a methylation-sensitive probe and the sum
of the signal intensities detected by the methylation and
non-methylation sensitive probes. Hence the beta-values
ranged from 0 (unmethylated) to 1 (fully methylated).
The samples were analyzed in three different batches
consisting of two bead chips in each batch. To adjust for
batch effects we used the ComBat implementation in the
R/Bioconductor package sva [28]. The chip number was
used as batch covariate, and the tissue type was used as the
sole biological covariate. The samples clustered according
to tissue type and not chip or array after applying this
algorithm (Supplementary Figure 1), and duplicates

Identification of genes with a plausible
methylation-directed expression
Genes with high and low methylation status in all
CCSKs in comparison with normal kidney (fetal and
adult), were identified with t-test, two group comparison,
p < 0.01 (Qlucore). The expression levels of the aberrantly
methylated genes were investigated using previously
published gene expression array data, HumanHT-12 v4
Expression BeadChips, Illumina [4], public in the Gene
Expression Omnibus database, http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/, GSE49972. Differentially expressed genes
in CCSK compared to normal kidney were identified as
above.
The gene expression data were merged using the
Combat algorithm [28] to another data set (the Gene
Expression Omnibus database, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/, GSE73209, including 32 WTs in addition to
eight samples (two CCSK, two adult kidneys and four
fetal kidneys) also analyzed on the CCSK gene expression
array described above. The RNA from the WTs was
extracted as previously described [3] and hybridized to
HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips. For sample

Identification of single nucleotide variants from
RNA-sequencing data

tissue microarray with cores from the different histological
compartments in totally 33 primary WTs [32] was used to
investigate EZH2-protein expression.

With the RNA-sequencing data previously
described [4], we called single nucleotide variants with
the RVBoost pipeline [30]. In short, RVBoost calls
variants using the UnifiedGenotyper tool from the GATK
suite and annotates variants with a QScore value. Six
different sequence features contribute with information
to the QScore, facilitating robust annotation of variants
introduced by the transcriptional apparatus and cDNAsynthesis. Variants that were annotated by RVBoost as
putative RNA-editing events and variants covered by
less than 10 reads were removed together with variants
with a QScore below 0.1. Variants were also removed
if present at any frequency in dbSNP version 130, the
1000 Genomes October 2014 release or release 0.3 of the
ExAC dataset from the Exome Aggregation Consortium
(ExAC), Cambridge, MA (http://exac.broadinstitute.
org) accessed June, 2015. Only variants present in the
coding regions of the 633 epigenetic regulators [22]
were retained for visual inspection using the Integrative
genomics viewer, http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/
[31]. Non-synonymous variants detected by more
than 40% of the reads were validated by amplifying an
approximately 300 bp long DNA segment covering the
nucleotide of interest with primers designed with Primer
3, http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3/. Primer sequences are
listed in Supplementary Table 4. The size and relative
concentration of the PCR-products were established
with agarose gel electrophoresis and equal amount of
the different amplicons were pooled and diluted. DNA
was prepared for sequencing with the Nextera XT DNA
sample preparation kit and Index kit (Illumina) according
to the manufacturer’s recommendation and sequenced on
a HiScanSQ (Illumina).

Immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray
Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections
(4 μm) were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated to
water through graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase
was blocked with 1% H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in
PBS pH 7.4 (Applichem) for 20 min. Heat induced epitope
retrieval (HIER) was performed with Target Retrieval
Solution pH 9.0 (DAKO) and 0.2 % Triton-X100 (Sigma)
in a pressure cooker at 120°C for 20 min. Sections were
incubated with primary antibody EZH2 1:400 (ab191080,
Abcam) diluted in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum
(Jackson Immuno Research) for 60 min. Staining was
visualized using BrightVision Poly-HRP-Anti rabbit RTU
(AH Diagnostics) for 30 min, followed by incubation
with DAB (Liquid DAB+ Substrate Chromogen System,
DAKO) for 5 min, and counterstained with Mayers
Htx (Histolab) for 30 sec. Slides were mounted with
Faramount Aqueous Mounting Medium (DAKO). A
