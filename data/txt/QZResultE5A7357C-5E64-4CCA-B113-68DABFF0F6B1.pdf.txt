ABSTRACT
SphK1 is known to play a role in tumor progression, resistance to
radiochemotherapy, and migration patterns. As the overall survival rates of squamous
cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) remain poor due to limitations in
surgery and irradiation and chemotherapy resistance, SphK1 is an important
enzyme to investigate. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the impact of
SphK1 on irradiation efficacy of HNSCC in-vitro with emphasis on EGFR signaling.
By immunhistochemical staining we found a positive correlation between EGFR
and SphK1 expression in patient specimens. In colony formation assays irradiation
sensitive cell lines showed a poor response to cetuximab, an EGFR inhibitor, and
SKI-II, a SphK1 inhibitor, and vice versa. In irradiation sensitive cells an enhanced
reduction of cell migration and survival was found upon simultaneous targeting of
EGFR and SphK1. In the present study, we elucidated a linkage between the two
signaling pathways with regard to the efficacy of cetuximab treatment and the impact
on the migration behavior of tumor cells. We investigated the biological impact of
inhibiting these pathways and examined the biochemical implications after different
treatments. An understanding of the processes involved could help to improve the
treatment of patients with HNSCC.

chemotherapy, with 5-year survival rates under 50% [2].
Prognoses of HNSCC disease are often difficult due to
a poor control of loco-regional disease and significant
morbidity [3].
An elevated expression of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) is significantly associated with

a reduced progression-free survival [4]. Indeed, EGFR
overexpression and alteration has been attributed to
HNSCC pathogenesis and progression. Hence, antiEGFR treatment regimens for HNSCC have been
implemented [5]. Mechanistically, EGFR targeting
with the human-murine chimeric immunoglobulin G1
cetuximab competitively prevents receptor activation by
endogenous ligands and results in EGFR downreguation
by internalization of the receptor/antibody complex [6].
We previously described an irradiation induced migration
of HNSCC cell lines that could be linked to EGFR
overexpression and could be reversed by blocking
the EGFR activity with the EGFR kinase inhibitor
AG1478 [7, 8].
Another prognostic indicator for HNSCC is
sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), a lipid kinase that
catalyzes the conversion of sphingosine to sphingosine1-phosphate (S1P), a biologically active lipid that plays
an important role in mammalian cell growth, survival,
and migration [9]. It has been shown that SphK1 mRNA
expression is significantly elevated in several malignant
diseases e.g., of the breast, colon, uterus, lung, ovary,
kidney, and rectum [10]. Increased levels of S1P result
from elevated SphK1 expression/activity and were
associated with suppression of apoptosis [11], enhanced
cell growth and migration [12], augmented angiogenesis
[13], pronounced resistance to irradiation [14], and
chemotherapy [15, 16]. Similarly, Sinah et al. found a
correlation between the tumor stage and elevated SphK1
expression in HNSCC [17].
Receptor crosstalk between members of different
receptor families is typical for transversal signal
transduction over the cell membrane [10]. The activation
mechanisms of SphK1 often involves a variety of growth
factors, amongst them e.g., platelet-derived growth factor

(PDGF), EGF, nerve growth factor (NGF), insulin growth
factor (IGF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)
[10]. Naturally, SphK1/S1P tyrosin kinase receptor/
RTK (EGFR) receptor interaction results in a shared
intracellular signaling network. Hobson et al. found that
cell migration stimulated by PDGF, which stimulates
sphingosine kinase and increases intracellular S1P, was
dependent on the expression of S1P-1-receptor [18]. Shida
et al. demonstrated that S1P induces the rapid and transient
tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in gastric cancer
cells [19]. However, studies on intermolecular receptor
crosstalk in HNSCC are lacking and no information is
available regarding the impact of anti-EGFR / SKI-II
targeting, and concurrent irradiation.
In this study we inhibited the SphK1 using
the non-competitive, kinase specific inhibitor
2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole (SKIII) that does not affect PKCα-, Erk2-, or PI3K-activity
[20]. SKI-II also has the effect of reducing SphK1 protein
expression [21]. This inhibitor reduces tumor growth in
mice and shows a favorable in-vivo half-life period of 15.3
h [22]. We analyzed EGFR signaling, cell survival, and
migration as a function of SphK1 targeting in HNSCC cell
lines.

RESULTS

Immunhistochemical stainings was done on tumor
samples of 180 patients. Table 1 shows the clinical data
of these patients. Immunohistochemistry revealed that

compared to the non-cancerous tissue (Suppl. Fig. 1).
SphK1 and EGFR expression does not correlate
with the clinical parameters staging, nodal status,
metastasis, grading relapse and late metastasis rate.
Only the lymph node stage and SphK1 overexpression
were significantly correlated (p = 0.024) (Tab. 2).
Tumors without a positive lymph node involvement
more frequently overexpressed SphK1 than those
with lymph node metastases. In addition, there was a
highly significant correlation between SphK1 and EGFR
expression (p = 0.01).

the outgrowth of these cell lines was significantly
inhibited upon treatment with SKI-II and cetuximab
in a dose-related manner (Fig. 2). Conversely, the
clonogenic formation of the irradiation sensitive Cal27
and HN cells was not impaired upon treatment with SKIII. The simultaneous administration of both SKI-II and
cetuximab significantly reduced the clonogenic survival
of UD-SCC-4, UD-SCC-5 and HN but not Cal27 cells
(Fig. 2).

Irradiation-sensitive cells show radiationinduced migration

HNCCC cell lines show different sensitivity to
irradiation

Irradiation caused a dose dependent increase of
migration activity in Cal27 whereas UD-SCC-5 cell
migration was not affected by irradiation treatment.
HN and UD-SCC-4 cell migration was stimulated by
irradiation with 5 Gy. Irradiation with 8 Gy did not further
enhance this effect (Fig. 3 A).

The colony formation assay (CFA) revealed a
strong impact of irradiation on Cal27 and HN cells, with
almost 50% of the clones not surviving treatment doses
of 8 Gy (Cal27, p = 0.0004; HN, p < 0.0001). In contrast,
the UD-SCC-4 and UD-SCC-5 cells behaved largely
insensitive to irradiation: The clonogenic survival of
UD-SCC-4 was not significantly reduced by 5 or 8 Gy
treatment doses. UD-SCC-5 survival was significantly
reduced only upon irradiation with 8 Gy (p = 0.0014)
(Fig. 1) (Suppl. Fig. 2).

SKI-II inhibits radiation-induced migration
The irradiation-induced migration of Cal27 cells
was reduced by the simultaneous cell treatment with 0.5
μM SKI-II (p = 0.0168) but only a trend was seen after
treatment with cetuximab (0.07 μM). Moreover, the
combination of both inhibitors did not lead to a further
inhibition than that of the SKI-II single treatment.
Accordingly, in HN, UD-SCC-4, and UD-SCC-5 cells
the combination treatment was most efficient (Fig. 3 B).

Radiation-resistant cell lines are sensitive to SKIII and cetuximab therapy
Although the clonogenic survival of UD-SCC-4 and
UD-SCC-5 cells was not severely affected by irradiation

Figure 1: Colony formation assay performed on Cal27, HN, UD-SCC-4, and UD-SCC-5 cell lines as indicated: The cell lines showed

different response to irradiation. Cal27 und HN cells appeared sensitive to irradiation whereas UD-SCC-4 and UD-SCC-5 cells were not.
Irradiation-resistant UD-SCC-4 and UD-SCC-5 cell lines showed reduced clonogenic survival upon SKI-II and cetuximab treatment.
In contrast, the clonogenic survival of irradiation sensitive Cal27 and HN cells is basically not reduced by SphK-1 and EGFR targeting
with SKI-II and cetuximab.

E-cadherin expression is inversely correlated
with irradiation-induced migration activity

EGFR targeting with cetuximab caused an increased
receptor phosphorylation both in Cal27 and UD-SCC-5
cells. Nevertheless, the cetuximab treatment resulted in
a reduced Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Strikingly,
the SphK1 protein expression was upregulated upon
cetuximab treatment in UD-SCC-5 but not in Cal27 cells
(Fig. 5).
SKI-II treatment did not alter the SphK1 expression
and did apparently not affect the Akt activity Cal27
and UD-SCC-5 cells. In contrast the SKI-II mediated
inhibition of SphK1 considerably attenuated Erk1/2
phosphorylation at Thr202/Tyr204 residues.
The combined administration of SKI-II and
cetuximab caused effects that were analogue to single
cetuximab treatment although an upregulation of the

Immunofluorescence revealed reduced E-cadherin
expression in Cal27 cells upon irradiation. E-cadherin
expression in UD-SCC-5 cells was, however, unaltered
upon pretreatment with SKI-II (Fig. 4).

SphK1 is upregulation in cetuximab treated UDSCC-5 cells
Due to the analogue response rates of Cal27 and HN
cells on the one hand and the UD-SCC-4 and UD-SCC-5
cells on the other hand, migration assays were narrowed
down to Cal27 and UD-SCC-5.

non-cancerous tissues. Four human tumor cell lines were
analyzed for their proliferation and survival capacity
upon anti-SphK1 targeting with the highly specific SKIII inhibitor and anti-EGFR targeting with cetuximab. In
addition the treatment dependent migration proficiency
was further analyzed. We used the SKI-II inhibitor
although it is classified as carcinogenic / teratogenic.

DISCUSSION
We aimed to elucidate the role of SphK1 in
HNSCC and the potential interactions with the EGFR
signaling pathway. The protein expression of SphK1
and EGFR in the tumor tissues from 180 patients
was analyzed and compared to the expression in

Figure 3: Wound healing assay: The radiation-sensitive cell line Cal27 reacted with a dose-dependent increase in migration after

irradiation; in contrast, the resistant cell line UD-SCC-5 exhibited no radiation-induced migration. The HN and UD-SCC-4 cell lines
shows a slightly increase of migration. The application of SKI-II and the combined administration of SKI-II and cetuximab inhibited Cal27
cell radiation-induced migration. The combination of inhibitors did not lead to an advantage compared to the single SKI-II treatment.
Conversely, the single treatment of the inhibitors showed little impact on UD-SCC-5 cell migration patterns. Their combination, however,
led to a significant reduction in migration, hence showing a significant advantage compared to the single treatment according to the CFA
results.

According to other data [27–29] we found an
elevated SphK1 and EGFR expression in HNSCC tissues
compared to non-neoplastic tissues. In addition, we
report for the first time a significant positive correlation
of SphK1 and EGFR expression. This finding suggests a
functional link of SphK1 and EGFR.
CFAs of irradiated and SKI-II / cetuximab treated
cells revealed two groups of HNSCC cell lines: On the
one hand UD-SCC-4 and UD-SCC-5 cells manifested as
irradiation resistant but cetuximab and SKI-II sensitive.
Treatment with the SphK-1 inhibitor SKI-II even restored
irradiation sensitivity in these cells (data not shown),
which has formerly been described elsewhere [17]. On
the other hand HN and Cal27 cells were sensitive to
irradiation but were resistant to SKI-II and cetuximab
treatment. These findings suggest that it might be possible
to stratify HNSCC patients into potential responders to
either irradiation or target specific anti-SphK-1/EGFR
treatment (Fig. 2, Suppl. Fig. 2).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The combination treatment with cetuximab and
SKI-II exceptionally reduced clonogenic survival of the
inhibitor-sensitive UD-SCC-4 and UD-SCC-5 cells. The
inhibition was even more pronounced at reduced doses
compared to the effects caused by single treatments at
higher doses (data not shown). The fact that cetuximab
treatment caused an upregulation of SphK1 expression
in UD-SCC-5 cells strongly indicates a functional link
between EGFR and SphK1: It is known that S1P can
transactivate several RTKs, including EGFR [10] and
that the transactivation of EGFR involves S1P-3, Src,
and MMP [19]. It is also known that EGFR downstream
signaling leads to the activation of Erk1/2 [30] and
that Erk1/2 activates SphK1 [31] (Fig. 6, illustration in
black/gray). Furthermore, the downstream signaling of
S1P receptors 1 and 3 causes activation of Erk1/2 [32]
and consequently results in an activation of SphK1 [31]
(Fig. 6, illustration in green). SphK1 is located at the
critical point of a complex amplification loop, and this

Figure 4: Immunofluorescence staining: Radiation doses of 8 Gy led to the degradation of E-cadherin in Cal27 cells; this effect, however,
was obviated after pretreatment with SKI-II. Irradiation did not affect E-cadherin in UD-SCC-5 cells. SKI-II improved cell adhesion by
upregulating the E-cadherin protein.

Figure 5: Western blot analyses: Cetuximab caused an increase in EGFR phosphorylation, which was not transmitted to the downstream
Erk1/2 and Akt signaling pathways. Cetuximab also caused an upregulation of SphK1 protein in UD-SCC-5 cells but not in Cal27 cells.
In UD-SCC-5 cells, however, the effect was attenuated by the addition of SKI-II.

Figure 6: Model of EGFR/SphK1 interaction: SphK1 is a component of different amplification loops. One loop involves the transactivation
of EGFR by S1P, causing the activation of Erk1/2 and thus the activation of SphK1. The other loop involves the activation of S1P receptors
1 and 3. Downstream signaling causes the activation of Erk1/2 via Ras and Erk1/2 is known to activate SphK1. Integrating these two
amplification loops into one model leads to a new understanding of EGFR- and SphK1-targeted therapies, as treatment targeting EGFR
only inhibits one loop. By western blot analyses, we found a compensatory upregulation of SphK1 after cetuximab treatment, leading to
attenuated effects of the drug, as observed by CFA and WHA. However, blocking both loops and thus inhibiting the upregulation of the
SphK1 protein leads to improved results of target therapies.

loop can apparently be broken through the combined
treatment of cetuximab and SKI-II (Fig. 6).
Cell migration is essential for metastasis.
Previous studies revealed a connection between SphK1
overexpression and migration capacity [12]. Here we
show that SphK-1 and EGFR targeting with SKI-II and
cetuximab inhibits the migration ability of HNSCC cell
lines. Consistent with the reduced capacity to form cell
colonies, we found an additive effect in UD-SCC-5 but
not in Cal27 cells when both inhibitors were applied at the
same time. Again a functional link between the SphK1 and
EGFR signaling must be assumed.
Irradiation is an established treatment strategy
for HNSCC patients. We previously reported radiationinduced migration in HNSCC cell lines [8]. The
underlying mechanisms are, however, barely understood.
Here we demonstrate that radiation-induced migration
is more pronounced in cell lines that are sensitive to
irradiation than in resistant cell lines. The irradiation
enhanced migration capacity observed in Cal27 cells goes
along with a downregulation of E-cadherin. Accordingly,
the inhibition of SphK-1 by SKI-II treatment results in an
upregulation of E-cadherin and simultaneously reduces
the radiation-induced migration of Cal27 cells. The
combination treatment with both inhibitors significantly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

affects the wound healing of UD-SCC-5 but not of Cal27.
Thus, SphK1 and EGFR most likely affect the radiationinduced migration independently.
Cetuximab treatment of Cal27 and UD-SCC-5 cells
caused EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr1068 but reduces
the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt (Fig. 5). This
finding is in agreement with data published elsewhere
[33]. Even more strikingly, UD-SCC-5 cell treatment with
cetuximab caused an upregulation of SphK1 protein that
might abrogate the desired anti-tumorigenic effect. The
SphK1 upregulation can, however, be repressed by the
combined anti-EGFR / anti-SphK1 targeting that restores
the sensitivity to either drug treatment.
In contrast to data published elsewhere [20]
we found a decreased p-Erk1/2 Thr202/Tyr204
phosphorylation upon SKI-II treatment. This discrepancy
can be explained by a reduced SphK1 product S1P upon
treatment with SKI-II, because S1P can activate the S1P
receptor and the downstream Erk1/2 signaling [32].
Moreover, S1P can transactivate RTKs (e.g. EGFR) and
thus can cause Erk1/2 activation [10].
Overall, we provide strong evidence for a functional
SphK1/EGFR interaction. To explain the effects described
above, we developed the model illustrated in Fig. 6:
Receptor specific targeting affects downstream signaling

pathways of either receptor system and consequently
tumor cell survival and migration. We suggest that
cetuximab treatment, blocks just one of the associated
signaling loops that results in a compensatory upregulation
of the SphK1 protein (Fig. 6, green illustration). This in
turn promotes the other signaling loop. Consequently,
HNSCC treatment can be most efficiently improved by
a synchronous targeting of both signaling loops i.e., by
a combined anti SphK1/anti-EGFR treatment (Fig. 6,
effecting green and black/gray loop). Our results indicate
that the amplification loop is active in tumors that are
sensitive to the inhibitors (e.g., represented by UDSCC-5 cells) though resistance to inhibitors cannot be
overcome by a combined treatment. Our results suggest
the side effects of cetuximab treatment could possibly be
ameliorated by a dose reduction.

(n=33), or larynx (n=56) were examined for EGFR and
SphK1 expression. The expression levels were compared
to non-cancerous tissue from the same patient.
The Medical Ethics Committee of the Technical
University of Munich approved this study.

CONCLUSION

Immunohistochemical staining

Tissue microarray preparation
Core needle biopsies of viable, representative areas
of each tumor specimen were retrieved from the original
tumor blocks using a manual array (Beecher Instruments,
Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, USA) and placed in a recipient
paraffin array block. The goal was to obtain at least three
tissue cylinders, with a diameter of 0.6 mm, from each
biopsy specimen.

Fresh 1.5 μm sections from TMA blocks were
transferred to glass slides, deparaffinized, and rehydrated.
An antigen retrieval method (microwave oven heating
in citrate-buffered saline) was applied following the
instructions provided by the manufacturer. The TMA slides
were cooled and incubated with antibodies against EGFR
(rabbit, clone D38B1) 1:200 (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, USA) and SPHK1 (rabbit) 1:200 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, USA). The reaction was developed
using the labeled streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase system;
DAB was used as the indicator. After counterstaining with
hematoxylin, the slides were dehydrated in ascending
concentrations of ethanol and mounted. Tissue with known
expression of the respective antigen was used for a positive
control; irrelevant antibodies of the immunoglobulin
isotype were used as negative control.

HNSCC cell lines (investigated in this study) can
be graduated in 2 groups: the first is irradiation resistant
but cetuximab and SKI-II sensitive, the second react
conversely.
SKI-II was found to reduce malignancy in all cell
lines, either directly by inhibiting proliferation, survival,
and migration, or indirectly by inhibiting irradiationinduced migration. Also, a combination treatment with
SKI-II and cetuximab could work efficiently in tumor
cells which basically respond well to cetuximab treatment
alone, because then lower cetuximab doses were required.
However, possible side effects of SKI-II especially in
combination treatments need to be further explored. The
high effects achieved with the combination of cetuximab
and SKI-II can most likely be attributed to positive
signaling amplification loops between the EGFR- and
SphK1 related pathways, although resistance to cetuximab
or SKI-II could not be overcome by their combination.
Therefore, we conclude that these amplification loops
do not play a role in the development of resistance to
cetuximab or SKI-II.
Currently, the therapy of patients with HNSCC in
the advanced stage III and IV implies primary radiotherapy
in combination with chemotherapy [34]. Our data indicate
that a change in the therapeutic strategies of patients with
HNSCC might be useful. Inhibition of the EGFR and
SphK1 in combination with the radiotherapy might be an
option to the conventional radiation and chemotherapy of
patients with HNSCC.

Scoring system for protein expression
A scoring system was used to describe the
expression levels of the different proteins. The staining
intensity was graded from 0 to 3 points (0 points = no
staining, 1 point = low staining intensity, 2 points =
moderate staining intensity, 3 points = strong staining
intensity). The proportion of stained cells was estimated
and graded from 0 to 4 points (0 points = 0% of the tumor
cells, 1 points = <10% of the tumor cells, 2 points = 10%29% of the tumor cells, 3 points = 30%-59% of the tumor
cells, 4 points = 60%-100% of the tumor cells). Both
scores were added to produce a cumulative score.

DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany), and UD-SCC-4 and
UD-SCC-5 cells were obtained from the University
of Düsseldorf (clinic for otolaryngology, Düsseldorf,

Germany) (Tab. 3) [35]. The cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany) containing 10% fetal calf serum
(FBS) (Biochrom, Berlin Germany), 2 mM glutamine
(Biochrom), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biochrom), and
100 U/ml penicillin (Biochrom), maintained at 37°C in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2, and grown to 70–90% confluence.

after 2 d of incubation. The cells were then pretreated with
inhibitors and optionally irradiated. Pictures of the scratch
were obtained directly after and at 12 h after the treatment.
The number of pixels covering with cells was evaluated
using Photoshop, and the magnitude of the points of
measurement was compared using the following formula:
((T2-T1) / 5038848) x 100
(T1 = 5038848 – the number of pixels at the start of
measurement)
(T2 = 5038848 – the number of pixels after 12 h)
(5038848 = the total number of pixels)

Irradiation

Irradiation was performed at the Department of
Radiotherapy (Technical University of Munich). The
cells were X-irradiated with single doses of 5 or 8 Gy at
room temperature using a Gulmay Medical X-ray source
operated at 70 kV and a dose rate of approximately 1 Gy/
min. The sham-treated group (0 Gy, control) was subjected
to the same protocol as the exposed cells.

Immunofluorescence
For immunofluorescence (IF), slides were coated
with 0.1% gelatin, and 2.5 x 105 cells/slide were seeded.
After 2 d of incubation, the cells were pretreated with
inhibitors and irradiated. At 1 h after treatment, the
cells were formalin fixed and stained with antibodies
against the following proteins: E-cadherin (mouse)
(Enzo Life Science, Lörrach, Germany), 1:200; EGFR
(rabbit) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas),
1:200; and SphK1 (rabbit) (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, USA), 1:200. Anti-rabbit-FITC (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, USA) and anti-mouse-Cyp3
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, USA) were used
for detection at a dilution of 1:200. The nuclei were
stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml) before mounting cells
with VectaShield® (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
USA). Fluorescence images were captured with a Leica
epifluorescence confocal microscope equipped with a
digital camera and Leica Application Suite LAS V3.7
acquisition software.

Inhibitors
SphK1 was specifically inhibited using
2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl) thiazole (SKIII) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at concentrations of
0.5 μM and 1 μM. Cetuximab was purchased from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany) and used at concentrations of 0.07
μM and 0.14 μM.

Colony formation assay
Cell survival was assessed by a colony formation
assay (CFA). The cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (5 ×
102 cells/well). After 1 d, the cells were pretreated with
cetuximab and SKI-II for one hour and subsequently
irradiated; the cells were then cultured for 10 days. The
cell colonies were formalin fixed and visualized by Crystal
Violet staining (Aldrich Chemie, Steinheim, Germany);
the colonies were counted after removing the dye by
washing.

Western blotting
For protein isolation, the cells were starved under
serum-free conditions for 12 h. One hour after treatment,
the cells were lysed in 1x lysis buffer (New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, USA) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF
(Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Equal amounts of protein
(15 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to

Wound-healing assay
Cell migration was assessed by wound-healing
assays (WHA). Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (5 x
105 cells/well), and a scratch was drawn into the cell layer

Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany).
The blocking of nonspecific binding sites was performed
using 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in TBST. The membranes
were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST
for 12–14 hours at 4°C. HRP-conjugated immunoglobulins
(diluted 1:5000 in 5% non-fat dry milk/TBST) served as
detection antibodies and were probed for 1 h at room
temperature. The immunoreactivity was visualized by
exposure to high-performance chemoluminescence film
(Biorad Laboratories, Munich, Germany). Antibodies
against the following were used: p-EGFR Tyr1068
(Rabbit) (New England Biolabs) (1:2500); EGFR (Rabbit)
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas) (1:2500);
p-Akt Ser473 (Rabbit) (New England Biolabs) (1:500);
Akt (Rabbit) (New England Biolabs) (1:1000); p-Erk1/2
Thr202/Tyr204 (Rabbit) (New England Biolabs) (1:1000);
Erk1/2 (Rabbit) (New England Biolabs) (1:1000); SphK1
(Rabbit) (New England Biolabs) (1:500); tubulin (Mouse)
(Sigma Aldrich Chemie, Steinheim, Germany) (1:10000);
anti-Rabbit HRP-linked IgG (Goat) (New England
Biolabs) (1:5000); and anti-Mouse HRP linked IgG (Goat)
(New England Biolabs) (1:2000).

A statistical analysis of the protein expression in
the tumor samples was performed using SPSS Statistics
software (version 18/19, IBM, Munich, Germany). The
relationship between the two proteins was tested by
crosstabs and the Fisher exact test. Results with p-values
<0.05 were considered significant. A statistical analysis
for the in vitro experiments was performed using Prism
Graph Pad 5.0 software. Assuming a symmetry correlation
structure for all the experiments, all the hypotheses
were tested with a one-way ANOVA. We compared the
separate treatments and the untreated control for statistical
significance with a t-test (p-values < 0.05).
