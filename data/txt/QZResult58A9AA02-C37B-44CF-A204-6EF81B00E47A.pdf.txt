ABSTRACT
Tumor microenvironments are characterized by decreased oxygen and nutrition
due to the rapid and progressive nature of tumors and also stresses induced by several
anti-tumor therapies. These intense cell stressors trigger a protective cell survival
mechanism heralded by the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is induced by
an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) following cell
starvation. Although the ER stress response is implicated in cytoprotection, its precise
role during anti-angiogenic therapy remains unclear. One of the major proteins involved
in ER stress is glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), which binds to unfolded proteins
and dissociates from membrane-bound ER stress sensors. To determine the role of
ER stress responses during anti-angiogenic therapy and the potential role of GRP78
in combined therapy in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), we used GRP78 overexpressing
or knockdown RCC cells under hypoxic or hypoglycemic conditions in vitro and in
animal models treated with sunitinib. Here, we report that GRP78 plays a crucial
role in protecting RCC cells from hypoxic and hypoglycemic stress induced by antiangiogenic therapy. Knockdown of GRP78 using siRNA inhibited cancer cell survival and
induced apoptosis in RCC cells in vitro and also resulted in ER stress-induced apoptosis
and hypoxic/hypoglycemic stress-induced apoptosis by inactivating the PERK/eIF-2α
pathway. Finally, GRP78 knockdown showed potent suppression of tumor growth and
enhanced the antitumor effect of sunitinib in RCC xenografts. Our findings suggest that
GRP78 may serve as a novel therapeutic target in combination with anti-angiogenic
therapy for the management of RCC.

deprivation successfully inhibits tumor growth and
leads to disease stabilization. Sunitinib, one of the most
efficacious multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting
VEGF, significantly prolongs progression-free survival in
patients with advanced RCC and is a first-line therapy for
metastatic RCC [1]. However, anti-angiogenic therapy is
generally not cytotoxic but rather cytostatic; thus, tumors
shrink and regress, but many tumor cells survive antiangiogenic treatment and resume growth following an
interval of stability. Once the tumor acquires resistance

INTRODUCTION
Recently developed targeted therapies have
shown promising results in the treatment of advanced
malignancies. In particular, anti-angiogenic therapies
that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
signaling have demonstrated remarkable clinical benefits
in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)

to the anti-angiogenic agent, the tumor rapidly progresses
and the prognosis is very poor, even with second- and
third-line treatment options.
Tumors
are
often
exposed
to
harsh
microenvironments. Due to their rapid and progressive
nature, tumors are surrounded by limited resources,
such as oxygen and nutrients. Moreover, many cancer
therapeutics deprive tumors of essential resources
for cancer cell survival. These intrinsic and extrinsic
environmental stressors generally induce the accumulation
of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of
cancer cells [4–5]. There, they elicit the unfolded protein
response (UPR), a general cellular defense mechanism that
dampens non-essential global protein synthesis to protect
cells from stress. Many ER-resident proteins display
altered expression patterns in cancer.
One of the most abundant ER-resident proteins is
the ER chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78),
also known as immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding
protein (BiP) [6]. A major UPR response is the induction
of GRP78/BiP, which is highly expressed in a variety of
tumors, including prostate cancer, melanoma, and head
and neck cancer [7], and confers drug resistance in both
proliferating and dormant cancer cells. GRP78 binds to
unfolded proteins and dissociates from the membranebound ER stress sensors; dissociation of GRP78 allows the
subsequent activation of stress sensors, which suppresses
global mRNA translation to protect cells from excessive
amounts of unfolded proteins [8]. This adaptive response
activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the
ER is mediated by at least three ER proximal sensors:
PKR-related ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring
enzyme-1 (IRE1) and activating transcription factor
(ATF) 6 [9]. PERK is a serine/threonine kinase that
phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A
(eIF2a), a translation initiation factor that functions in
the early steps of protein synthesis by forming a ternary
complex with GTP and initiator tRNA during stress and
consequently attenuates global protein translation [9].
A recent study revealed that GRP78 is highly expressed
in RCC cells and suggested a significant relationship
between GRP78 expression and clinicopathological
features of RCC, including tumor size, histological
grade, and stage [10]. Another study showed that GRP78
expression was significantly associated with shorter
disease-specific survival [11]. In addition, anti-vascular
and anti-angiogenic therapies reportedly resulted in
severe glucose and oxygen deprivation, which could lead
to GRP78 induction in residual tumor cells and ultimately
drug resistance [12].
GRP78 protects tumor cells from apoptosis under
several stress conditions, including hypoxia, nutrient
deprivation and cytotoxic chemotherapy [13–15].
Moreover, GRP78 expression is also a predictor of poor
outcomes in RCC. However, the precise role of GRP78 in
cancer following anti-angiogenic therapy remains unclear.
We hypothesized that stress conditions induced by intrinsic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or extrinsic stresses, such as anti-angiogenic therapy, lead to
ER stress responses with increased GRP78 activity that aids
tumor cell survival during oxygen and nutrient deprivation.
In this study, we show that ER stress responses are activated
during anti-angiogenic therapy and that inhibition of the
UPR by GRP78 knockdown potently suppresses tumor
progression and enhances the antitumor effects of antiangiogenic therapy in RCC both in vitro and in vivo. Our
results suggest that GRP78 may serve as a novel therapeutic
target in the current therapeutic strategy for RCC.

RESULTS
GRP78 expression is highly upregulated by
hypoxic or hypoglycemic stress in RCC cells
To further determine whether anti-angiogenic
therapy-induced ER stress is caused by hypoxic stress,
hypoglycemic stress, or a combination of both, we
examined GRP78 expression in Caki-1 cells following
exposure to hypoxic and/or hypoglycemic conditions.
Western blot analysis indicated that GRP78 was upregulated
by hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and both in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 1A–1C). These data suggest that hypoxia
and nutrition deprivation induce ER stress in RCC cells.

Anti-angiogenic therapy induces ER stress
response in RCC xenografts
To determine whether ER stress chaperone protein
GRP78 is upregulated during anti-angiogenic therapy, we
treated Caki-1 xenografts with sunitinib, a multi-tyrosine
kinase inhibitor and potent anti-angiogenic agent, and
used immunohistochemical staining to examine changes
in GRP78 expression in xenografts. Sunitinib treatment
induced intratumoral hypoxia in Caki-1 xenografts
(Figure 2A and 2B). After five days of sunitinib treatment,
GRP78 expression was higher than that in the control
group (Figure 2C and 2D). GRP78 was also upregulated
in the control group at a later stage; however, the
treatment group still displayed higher GRP78 expression
(Figure 2C and 2D), suggesting that ER stress response
may be induced by oxygen or nutrient deprivation from
anti-angiogenic therapy. However, GRP78 expression
was not significantly altered in normal tissues following
treatment with sunitinib (Figure S1). Comparison of tumor
and normal tissues following anti-angiogenic therapy
revealed that GRP78 was more highly upregulated in
tumor tissues. These data suggest that GRP78 may serve
as a therapeutic target of anti-angiogenic therapy in RCC.

Induction of GRP78 protects RCC cells from

To confirm the role of GRP78 in tumor cell
survival and proliferation under stress conditions, we

further determine whether GRP78 protects tumor cells from

staurosporine, and a reduction in apoptotic cell death was
confirmed in GRP78-overexpressing Caki-1 cells. Next, we
knocked down PERK in GRP78-overexpressing Caki-1 cells
using PERK siRNA plus staurosporine treatment. GRP78
overexpression did not affect apoptotic cell death after
knockdown of PERK in Caki-1 cells (Figure 3D), indicating
that GRP78 exerts both pro-survival and anti-apoptotic roles

blot analysis showed that both caspase-3 and PARP were

determine whether GRP78 knockdown enhances ER
stress-induced apoptosis, we used MG132, a proteosome
inhibitor that induces apoptosis via the ER stressmediated apoptotic pathway [16], to induce ER stress in
Caki-1 cells. MG132 inhibited cell growth and induced
apoptosis in Caki-1 cells and GRP78 knockdown
enhanced MG132-induced apoptosis (Figure 4F). These
data demonstrate that GRP78 knockdown suppresses
cancer cell survival by inducing apoptosis in RCC cells.

further growth inhibition in addition to that due to hypoxia,
hypoglycemia, or both (Figure 5B–5D). To further study
the effect of GRP78 inhibition combined with hypoxia or
hypoglycemia on cell survival, we examined cell cycle
distribution using flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis
showed that GRP78 knockdown significantly increased
the number of apoptotic cells under all conditions
examined (Figure 5E and 5F). GRP78 knockdown in cells
suffering from hypoxic and hypoglycemic stress induced
downregulation of phosphorylated PERK and eIF2α,
inactivation of ATF-4, and activation of CHOP, suggesting
that GRP78 further induces apoptotic cell death in RCC
cells via downregulation of the PERK/eIF2α/AFT-4
pathway under conditions of stress (Figure 5G)

and is conservatively preserved in normal cells. However,
a previous study showed that GRP78 heterozygosity
impedes mammary tumor growth and inhibits tumor
proliferation. GRP78 heterozygosity also promotes cancer
cell apoptosis while mice exhibit normal growth, organ
development, and antibody production, suggesting that
GRP78 may represent a good target candidate for cancer
therapy [7]. Here, we showed that GRP78 expression was
induced in RCC xenografts following anti-angiogenic
therapy, and that GRP78 knockdown effectively inhibited
tumor proliferation and induced apoptosis in RCC both
in vitro and in vivo by impeding UPR pathways.
The anti-tumor effects of anti-angiogenic agents
are attributable to their ability to deprive tumors cells of
vessels supplying oxygen and nutrients. Tumor cells can
adapt to a low-oxygen environment, owing to hypoxiainducible factors (HIFs), which regulate the expression
of more than 60 genes involved in angiogenesis,
anaerobic glycolysis, and cell survival; the coordinated
expression of these genes results in cellular adaptation to
prolonged and acute hypoxia [17–19]. However, when the
downstream effectors of HIFs are functionally blocked,
hypoxia induces additional HIF-independent adaptive
responses, such as ER stress, that contribute to increased
survival under low-oxygen conditions. Thus, cells with
a compromised ER stress pathway show significant
sensitivity to ER stress created by the deleterious effects
of accumulated unfolded proteins in the ER [17, 20, 21].
Since GRP78 is a master regulator of ER stress,
UPR responses can be effectively downregulated by
targeting GRP78. Hypoxic stress induces ER stress
responses in a PERK- and eIF2α-dependent manner.
UPR is orchestrated through activation of PERK, IRE1
and ATF6, all three of which are bound and sequestered
by GRP78 under normal conditions [22]. When an
unfolded protein load triggers the dissociation of GRP78
from these three sensors, UPR signaling is initiated.
Activated PERK rapidly increases phosphorylation of
the translation initiation factor eIF2α, which prevents the
influx of additional nascent polypeptides to the ER [22]
and upregulates genes that promote amino acid sufficiency
and redox homeostasis [23–25]. Phosphorylation of
eIF2α plays a central role in coupling the rate of protein
synthesis to the cellular response to different types of
stress and energy availability. A rapid and robust increase
in eIF2α phosphorylation at Ser51 is observed in response
to hypoxia [26]. This modification correlates with a
reduction in protein synthesis rate and is not observed
following other stresses, such as low serum or genotoxic
stress. Phosphorylation of eIF2α is independent of HIF1α
status, as it also occurs in a similar manner in HIF1α−/−
mouse embryonic fibroblasts [9, 27]. In the present study,
inhibition of GRP78 reduced the PERK phosphorylation
in RCC cells. In addition, GRP78 knockdown inhibited the
activation of both PERK and eIF2α under both normoxic
and hypoxic conditions, suggesting that GRP78 may be
the best target for inhibiting the ER stress response.

In vivo knockdown of GRP78 induces tumor
regression and enhances the anti-tumor effect
of anti-angiogenic therapy in RCC xenografts
To confirm the effect of GRP78 inhibition on
tumor growth in vivo, we developed Caki-1 cells stably
expressing siGRP78 (Caki-1-shGRP78) or empty vector
(Caki-1-Mock), which were then used to establish
subcutaneous xenografts in mice (Figure 6A). Tumors
were successfully developed, and consistent tumor
growth was achieved in Caki-1-Mock xenografts.
However, tumor growth was not successfully achieved
in Caki-1-shGRP78 xenografts (Figure 6B, data for
clone 2 not shown). These results suggest that GRP78
plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression
in RCC. Next, to determine whether GRP78 targeting
has a therapeutic effect in RCC and whether GRP78
inhibition makes RCC cells more vulnerable to antiVEGF-targeted therapy, we developed tetracyclineinducible shGRP78-expressing Caki-1 cells and
established subcutaneous xenografts using these cells in
nude mice (Figure 6C). Mice treated with doxycycline
showed significantly reduced tumor growth compared
with the other groups. Remarkable growth inhibition
was observed using the combination of sunitinib and
GRP78 suppression (Figure 6D–6F). These results
indicate that GRP78 inhibition enhances antitumor
activity of anti-angiogenic therapy in vivo.

DISCUSSION
VEGF-targeted anti-angiogenic therapy is a
revolutionary treatment for the treatment of advanced
RCC. In contrast to conventional cytotoxic therapy, antiangiogenic therapy suppresses tumor cells by inducing
tumor hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Nevertheless,
cancer cells eventually develop compensatory mechanisms
to survive starvation and hypoxia. One response to antiangiogenic therapy is the ER stress response, which allows
tumor cells to survive hypoxia, low-nutrient conditions,
or low-pH conditions during anti-angiogenic therapy.
GRP78 plays a central role in this defense mechanism

CHOP is downstream of the PERK and eIF-2α
phosphorylation cascade. Activation of PERK and eIF2a
induces CHOP accumulation, which plays a critical role
in the switch from pro-adaptive to pro-apoptotic signaling
[9]. CHOP promotes protein synthesis and oxidation in
the stressed ER, thereby contributing to the induction of
cell death. It also modulates the Bcl-2 family of proteins
and growth and arrest DNA damage inducible protein
34 (GADD34), causing damage to the mitochondrial
membrane and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol
[28–30]. Our results show that the pro-apoptotic effects of
GRP78 inhibition occur via CHOP activation, subsequent
to PERK and eIF2α activation in RCC cells.
Inhibition of GRP78 halts the important defense
mechanism required for survival in starving tumor cells
and makes tumor cells more vulnerable to environmental
stresses such as hypoxia and glucose deprivation.
Combination therapy that stimulates ER stress-mediated
apoptotic pathways while simultaneously downregulating
the induction of pro-survival GRP78 may substantially
enhance drug efficacy. For this reason, targeting ER
stress responses through GRP78 inhibition may be a
reasonable approach for combination cancer therapy
with VEGF-targeted anti-angiogenic agents. In addition
to the protective role of GRP78 in cancer cells, GRP78
also promotes tumor proliferation. In the present study,
overexpression of GRP78 increased the proliferation
of RCC cells, and GRP78 knockdown had significant
antitumor effects under normal conditions without
stresses (i.e., hypoxia and glucose deprivation). These
results demonstrate that GRP78 plays a critical role
in tumor proliferation and progression even in normal
tumor environments, suggesting that GRP78 targeting
may represent an effective cancer treatment option as
monotherapy.
In conclusion, our study showed that the inhibition
of GRP78 successfully enhanced the antitumor effect of
sunitinib in RCC, indicating that GRP78 is an excellent
target for combination therapy with anti-angiogenic
treatments. Targeting ER stress responses may serve as
a novel approach to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of
anti-angiogenic agents and to delay the development of
resistance.

1.2 × 105 cells/well. At 30%–50% confluence, cells were
transfected for 16 h with the siRNAs using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) diluted with
OPTIMEM (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. After transfection,
the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and cells

polyclonal selection and confirmation, stable cell lines
were frozen at early (less than 10) passages.

to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot system
(Bio-Rad) as described previously [14]. Membranes were
blocked in 5% skim milk diluted with Tris-buffered saline
and Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature and
incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 3% skim
milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature or overnight
at 4°C. Antibodies against the following proteins were
used for Western blot analysis (all from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology): GRP78 (C–20) (diluted 1:1000), PERK
(1:1000), p-PERK (1:250–500), p-eIF2α (1:250–500),
GADD153 (1:500), CREB-2 (1:500), and vinculin
(1:5000). Anti-goat, anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibodies (1:5000) were used. Amersham
enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare)
or Supersignal chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo
Scientific) were used to detect immunoreactive proteins.

Development of hypoxia and glucose-deprivation

Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in six-well
plates and allowed to attach overnight. To evaluate
baseline expression of GRP78 in wild-type RCC cells
and GRP78-overexpressing cells, cells were washed
with ice-cold PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol mixed
with acetone (3:1) for 10 min at room temperature, and
treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After
blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, cells
were then incubated with anti-GRP78 (C–20) antibody at
room temperature for 1 h, washed three times with TBS,
and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-goat
antibody for 1 h in a dark room. Nuclei were stained with
DAPI. Immunofluorescence was imaged using a Zeiss
confocal laser scanning microscope.

Immunofluorescence

Hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) were induced
using a hypoxia chamber (Coy Corporation). Cells were
exposed to hypoxia (1% oxygen) and maintained in the
hypoxia chamber during the assay. Deprivation of glucose
was achieved by using glucose-free media supplemented
with low glucose (2 mmol/L).

Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded onto six-well plates at
1.2 × 105 cells per well, incubated overnight, and
transfected. After incubation for an additional 72 h, cells
were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and stained with a
0.5% crystal violet solution. Cells were then washed with
water, and any remaining crystal violet was resolved with
Sorensen’s solution. Absorbance was measured at 562 nm
on a spectrophotometer. All experiments were performed
in triplicate.

In vivo xenograft models
All animal experiments were conducted in
compliance with accepted standards of the University of
British Columbia Committee on Animal Care. General
anesthesia of mice was induced and maintained by inhaled
isoflurane. Six- to eight-week-old female nu/nu nude
mice were subcutaneously injected in the flank area with
a cell suspension containing 3 × 106 tumor cells. Caki-1
cells were used to evaluate GRP78 expression following
sunitinib treatment. Caki-1 cells stably expressing
doxycycline-inducible shGRP78 were used to investigate
the effect of GRP78 knockdown in vivo. When the tumor
size reached 150–250 mm3, mice were randomized to
receive vehicle, sunitinib, doxycycline, or sunitinib and
doxycycline for 30 days (n = 8 mice per group). Every
three days, tumor size was measured using calipers and
body weight was determined. Tumor volume was calculated
as length × width × height × 0.5. After treatment was
complete, mice were euthanized in a CO2 chamber followed
by cervical dislocation. Tumors were fixed in 10% formalin
for immunohistochemical staining or frozen at − 80°C for
protein and RNA analyses.

Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis
Cells were harvested and fixed with 70% alcohol
as a single-cell suspension. Fixed cells were collected by
centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). Cells were incubated with RNase A (1 mg/mL) for
30 min at 37°C and then incubated with propidium iodide
(PI; 20 μg/mL; Sigma Chemical) for 30 min. Relative
DNA content was determined using a FACSCanto II flow
cytometer and FACSDiva software (BD Bioscience).

Western blot analysis
Cellular proteins were harvested in RIPA lysis
buffer containing vanadate, phosphatase inhibitor and
phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Proteins were resolved
by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels and transferred

Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were
cut into 4-μm sections, which were deparaffinized,
rehydrated with xylene and ethanol, and transferred
into 0.02% Triton for permeabilization. Slides in citrate
buffer (pH 6) were heated in a steamer for 3 min,
washed in PBS for 5 min, incubated in 3% bovine
serum albumin, transferred into 3% H2O2, and incubated
with anti-GRP78 antibody overnight. For quantitative
analysis of immunohistochemical staining, expression
of pimonidazole was measured using ImageJ and
expression of GRP78 was measured using MetaMorph
4.6 software (Universal Imaging Co., Downingtown,
PA, USA). Automated counting of numbers of pixels
in the four different intensity zones were received and
after determining these numbers, we applied them to a
simple algebraic formula as shown below to determine
the score of the image. Score = (Number of pixels in a
zone) × (Score of the zone) / (Total number of pixels in
the image).
