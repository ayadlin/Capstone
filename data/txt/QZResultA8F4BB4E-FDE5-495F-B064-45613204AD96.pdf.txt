BACKGROUND: Dasatinib exhibited activity in preclinical models of sarcoma. The Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC) conducted a multicenter, phase 2 trial of dasatinib in patients with advanced sarcoma. METHODS: Patients received
dasatinib twice daily. The primary objective was to estimate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) (complete response or partial response
within 6 months or stable disease duration of 6 months) with a target of 25%. Patients were enrolled into 1 of 7 different cohorts
and assessed by imaging every 8 weeks using Choi criteria tumor response and a Bayesian hierarchical design. For each subtype,
enrollment was stopped after a minimum of 9 patients were treated if there was a <1% chance the CBR was 25%. RESULTS: A total
of 200 patients were enrolled. Accrual was stopped early in 5 cohorts because of low CBR. The leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) cohorts fully accrued and 6 of 47 and 8 of 42 evaluable patients, respectively, exhibited clinical
benefit. The probability that the CBR was 25% in the LMS and UPS cohorts was 0.008 and 0.10, respectively. The median
progression-free survival ranged from 0.9 months in patients with rhabdomyosarcoma to 2.2 months in patients with LMS. The median overall survival was 8.6 months. The most frequent adverse events were constitutional, gastrointestinal, and respiratory, and 36%
of patients required dose reduction for toxicity. Serious adverse events attributed to therapy occurred in 11% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib may have activity in patients with UPS but is inactive as a single agent in the other sarcoma subtypes included
herein. The Bayesian design allowed for the early termination of accrual in 5 subtypes because of lack of drug activity. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
The combined incidence of soft tissue and bone sarcomas in the United States is approximately 14,000.1 Incurable,
advanced, localized, or metastatic disease occurs in >50% of patients with sarcoma. The median life expectancy of patients
receiving palliative chemotherapy is approximately 12 to 18 months.2,3 Gemcitabine plus docetaxel was reported to result
in a median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of 6.2 months and 17.9 months, respectively, and
was superior to gemcitabine alone in a randomized trial.3 A phase 3 trial of pazopanib demonstrated a 3-month improvement in the median PFS compared with placebo but only a 2-month improvement (from 10.7 to 12.5 months) in OS,
which was not statistically significant.4 The majority of patients with advanced sarcoma rapidly exhaust chemotherapy
options, and new effective treatments are needed.

Dasatinib in Patients With Sarcoma/Schuetze et al

The intracellular kinase c-SRC interacts with the receptor tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor receptor,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-KIT and intracellular enzymes such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as
a component of pathways regulating proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Many sarcoma subtypes express FAK.5 Microarray tumor assessments
suggest that SRC is more highly expressed in leiomyosarcoma (LMS) compared with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS).6 Kinase profiling studies suggest
that the SRC pathway is active in chondrosarcoma.7
Recently, activated SRC has been detected in synovial sarcoma and contributes to a malignant phenotype.8
Dasatinib is a potent small molecule inhibitor of
SRC, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, KIT, BCRABL, and ephrin receptor kinases, and is approved for the
treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and in patients
with CML who are intolerant of or have disease that is refractory to imatinib. A phase 1 dose escalation trial of
dasatinib in patients with solid tumors established a dose
of 120 mg twice daily for 5 of 7 days weekly or 70 mg
twice daily continuously as tolerable doses.9 Preclinical
studies have suggested that inhibition of receptor tyrosine
kinase or FAK signaling via interaction with SRC affects
the growth of sarcoma. Dasatinib was found to have
growth inhibitory activity in vitro in a SRC-expressing
rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, in osteosarcoma and Ewing
sarcoma (ES) cell lines, and in synovial sarcoma.8,10,11
However, in studies by Kolb et al, anticancer preclinical
activity of dasatinib was not observed in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) or ES cell lines or in osteosarcoma xenografts.12 Other research suggests that inhibition of SRC
phosphorylation by dasatinib may affect the malignant
phenotype of cells by blocking cell invasion and migration
or by affecting the tumor microenvironment; however, a
reduction in SRC phosphorylation in osteosarcoma did
not lead to reduction in lung metastasis in an in vivo
mouse model.10,13
The primary objective of the current study was to
estimate the clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as objective tumor response within 6 months or stable disease for
at least 6 months after the initiation of dasatinib in
patients with advanced sarcoma. Secondary aims included
estimation of the median time to tumor progression, 2year and 5-year survival rates, and the serious adverse
event (AE) rate. Exploratory analyses were undertaken to
examine expression of SRC and FAK in archived patient
tumor samples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study

The current study was a multiinstitutional, open-label,
single-arm trial of dasatinib in patients with advanced sarcoma. Three parallel trials, focused on different histologic
types of sarcoma (aggressive sarcoma subtypes, indolent
sarcoma subtypes, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor
[GIST]), were conducted under 1 parent study. In the
aggressive sarcoma trial, patients were enrolled into 1 of 7
cohorts (LMS, liposarcoma, UPS, malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumor [MPNST], osteosarcoma, ES, or
RMS). The GIST and indolent-type sarcoma cohorts
were evaluated using different statistical designs and the
results were reported separately. The Sarcoma Alliance for
Research through Collaboration (SARC) (www.sarctrials.
org) provided central coordination of study conduct,
patient enrollment, and auditing. Cancer Research and
Biostatistics (www.crab.org) developed and maintained
an electronic study database. Bristol-Myers Squibb provided dasatinib and financial support. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00464620).
Patients

To be eligible for the trial, patients were required to be
aged 13 years; weigh  50 kg; have incurable sarcoma,
measurable disease by Choi criteria, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score 2; and be
able to swallow tablets. In the aggressive sarcoma trial,
patients were required to have received, not been medically fit for, or had refused treatment with at least 1 line of
standard chemotherapy. Full eligibility criteria are listed
in the online Supporting Information. The current study
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at each
participating site, and all patients provided written
informed consent.
Study Treatment and Evaluations

The initial protocol starting dose and schedule was
100 mg of dasatinib administered orally twice daily. The
protocol was amended to reduce the starting dose to
70 mg twice daily after completion of the phase 1 trial.9
Dose adjustments were allowed for toxicity (see online
Supporting Information) to 50 mg twice daily and then
100 mg once daily based on better dasatinib tolerability
with once-daily dosing.14 Protocol treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Disease assessment using computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging was performed
within 2 weeks before treatment and was repeated using
the same technique every 2 months for 6 months and then
869

Original Article

every 3 months until disease progression was documented.
Electrocardiograms were obtained during screening and
after the first month to assess corrected QT interval.
Safety evaluations included complete blood counts and a
comprehensive metabolic panel including magnesium
performed at least monthly for the first 6 months, every 6
weeks for the next 6 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter while patients were receiving treatment. During the
first month, complete blood counts were performed
weekly. AEs were recorded according to National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3.0).
The primary endpoint was CBR using the criteria of
Choi et al evaluating the unidimensional measurement and
density (measured in Hounsfield units on CT scans only)
of tumor masses.15 The criteria of Choi et al was selected as
the tumor response criteria because at the time the trial was
designed, it correlated better with patient outcome compared with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) in patients with GIST who were treated with a
tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Patients were considered evaluable for the primary endpoint if they had an eligible sarcoma subtype on central pathology review (performed by
D.R.L.) and completed at least 4 weeks of treatment. Only
tumor size was considered in response assessment for
patients evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging.
Patients were censored for PFS at the date of last radiology
evaluation if disease progression had not occurred and were
censored for survival at the date of last contact. Survival
time was calculated from the date of registration to death.
Patients were contacted at least every 12 months after the
discontinuation of treatment to assess survival status.
Statistical Analysis

A hierarchical phase 2 monitoring method was used to conduct the trial.16 In particular, a Bayesian hierarchical model
was used to model the 7 CBR rates. The hierarchical model
was motivated by the considerations that 1) at the initiation
of the trial the 7 CBR rates were exchangeable and 2) a
response in 1 disease subtype should increase the belief that
there may be activity in the other subtypes. This model was
calibrated to reflect a prior belief that initially for any subtype there was a 15% chance that the CBR was greater than
the target 25%. We a priori quantified an association
among the CBRs as follows: if 2 of 6 responses were
observed in subtype 1, then the likelihood the CBR rate
was >25% would increase from 15% to approximately
40% for subtype 1 and from 15% to approximately 20%
in any other subtype. Within a disease subtype, enrollment
was terminated due to futility if, given the current data,
870

there was a <1% chance that the activity level in this subtype was at least the target 25%. Under the hierarchical
Bayesian model, the “data” used in this adaptive decision
rule included data from all 7 subtypes combined, so that
the subtypes “borrowed strength” from each other statistically. Within each of the 7 cohorts, the stopping rule was
not applied until at least 9 patients were enrolled and
treated to avoid terminating enrollment within a subtype
with insufficient data. Enrollment continued within each
cohort until the stopping rule was reached or a maximum
of 48 patients were enrolled and treated.
RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Disease
Characteristics

Between May 2007 and September 2009, 200 patients
with advanced, high-grade sarcoma were enrolled into this
multicenter phase 2 study. Central pathology review was
performed on all registered and enrolled patients. Two
patients (1 with desmoid sarcoma and 1 with myofibroblastic sarcoma) had ineligible subtypes and were excluded
from the activity but included in the safety analysis. Demographics are provided in Table 1. Eighteen patients were
deemed to not be eligible for or declined standard chemotherapy before enrollment. All patients, except for 7 who
withdrew from participation, had either completed 5 years
of follow-up or had died at the time of this report.
Dasatinib Treatment and Activity

A median of 2 cycles (range, 1-46 cycles) of therapy were
administered. Four patients did not initiate treatment
with dasatinib after enrollment. The reasons for discontinuing treatment are shown in Table 2. Two cohorts
(LMS and UPS) continued enrollment to a predefined
maximum number of patients and 5 cohorts suspended
enrollment early because of a lack of drug activity. Eight
patients with UPS, 6 with LMS, and 6 with osteosarcoma
experienced clinical benefit as defined in the protocol.
The probability of CBR is shown in Figure 1. The median
duration of response was 5.7 months (range, 1.2-34.4
months). Altogether, objective tumor response, confirmed on at least 2 evaluations, occurred in 2 patients
with UPS using a >10% reduction in tumor size and in 5
patients with LMS, 3 with UPS, 3 with osteosarcoma, and
1 with ES using a >15% reduction in tumor density.
RECIST-defined objective responses were observed in the
2 patients with UPS who had Choi response by a reduction in tumor size. There was no association found
between tumor expression of SRC, phospho-SRC, or
FAK and response or CBR (data not shown). PFS by

attributed to dasatinib. One event of sudden death was
possibly related to dasatinib, but the other deaths that
occurred on treatment were attributed to sarcoma progression. Electrocardiograms were available for 198
patients and 143 patients, respectively, before and after 4
weeks of treatment. The mean and median corrected QT
intervals before and after 4 weeks of treatment were 424
milliseconds and 427 milliseconds and 432 milliseconds
and 436 milliseconds, respectively, and lengthened to
>500 milliseconds in only 2 patients. Other cardiovascular events included 1 episode each of atrial and ventricular
tachyarrhythmia; 2 episodes each of hypotension, palpitation, and pericardial effusion; and 1 episode of syncope.
Hematologic toxicity was infrequent with grade 1 neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia occurring
in 4.1%, 3.6%, and 6.7% of patients, respectively; however, anemia was reported in 24% of patients.
DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrated that a sarcoma histologyspecific, multicohort trial can rapidly accrue and be successfully completed through the SARC consortium; 200
patients were enrolled from 19 institutions over the course
of 29 months. Furthermore, it builds on our experience in
conducting Bayesian-driven trials, which help to reduce
patient enrollment on inactive treatment arms.3,17 The key
point of this approach was to borrow strength across subtypes but avoid the obvious pitfall of assuming all subtypes
would respond in the same manner. Given the data
observed in the trial, the Bayesian approach that was used
provided several advantages. First, fewer patients were enrolled in 3 of the cohorts (liposarcoma, MPNST, and
872

RMS) than would have been enrolled if a frequentist
approach with a similar CBR goal was used. By borrowing
strength across cohorts, the likelihood of observing the
desired 25% CBR was decreased in all subtypes and resulted
in accrual being terminated sooner in osteosarcoma than if a
statistical approach that assumed the subtypes were independent had been used. In addition, using the Bayesian
design, we were able to more precisely estimate the probability of CBR in the 3 subtypes with patients obtaining a tumor response or stable disease for 6 months. Advantages
of the multicohort design were that several subtypes were
stopped earlier for futility than would have been expected
and we were able to estimate CBR rates more precisely for
each subtype than if the trial had combined all subtypes into
a single cohort. We believe these are major advantages in the
study of sarcoma with diverse histologic subtypes compared
with bundling subtypes together.
We observed a uniformly rapid rate of disease progression in ES, MPNST, and RMS and a more variable
rate of disease progression in LMS and osteosarcoma,
which was similar to our prior study of imatinib and
should be considered in trial design.17 Fewer than 10% of
patients with ES, MPNST, or RMS in the sarcoma dasatinib or imatinib trials were free from sarcoma progression
for 4 months after initiating therapy, suggesting that the
4-month PFS rate may be a good measure of potential
drug activity in these subtypes. Of interest is the objective
tumor response in patients with UPS who were treated
with dasatinib (which was also noted in a patient treated
in the imatinib trial) suggesting there may be benefit from
tyrosine kinase inhibition in carefully selected patients with
this sarcoma subtype. Three of the patients with UPS and 3
with LMS experienced prolonged disease stability for >12
months. Although this result may be explained by

heterogeneity in the natural history of UPS and LMS,
detailed genomic evaluation of the “responders” is planned
to explore potential biomarkers that might be used to study
the preselection of patients for treatment with dasatinib or
other tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Overall, dasatinib did not result in a clinically significant level of activity against previously treated patients
with high-grade, advanced sarcomas in this trial using
RECIST or the criteria of Choi et al, even though a few
more responses were scored using the criteria of Choi et al
compared with RECIST. Significant differences between
the criteria of Choi et al and RECIST are the addition of
change in tumor density on CT and smaller magnitude of
change in tumor size to score response and disease progression. The addition of the tumor density criterion in
the system of Choi et al accounted for the majority of
objective responses recorded in the current study; however, the clinical benefit rate fell below the predefined goal
of 25% in all cohorts except UPS. Moreover, the 6-month
PFS rates were <15% in all cohorts, suggesting that dasatinib is inactive based on threshold of activity proposed by
the European Organization for Research and Treatment
of Cancer based on previous trials of chemotherapy.18 In
contrast, in patients with advanced sarcoma, treatment
with pazopanib yielded a 6-month PFS rate of 36%.19
The toxicity profile of dasatinib in this sarcoma trial
was similar to the experience in other trials and included
fatigue, anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, pleural effusion, and
dyspnea.9,20-23 Approximately 30% of the patients who

a dose reduction because of toxicity. The relatively high
rate of AEs in patients with sarcoma who are treated with
dasatinib at the starting dose, coupled with the very low
CBR, provides the basis for our belief that dasatinib
should not be used in clinical practice to treat the subtypes
of aggressive sarcoma studied in our trial. Severe AEs were
infrequent with exception of pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and
pleural effusion, which occurred in >5% of patients.
Pleural effusions developed in 20% of patients with sarcoma, which is similar to the frequency noted among
patients with CML but lower than that in patients with
breast or lung cancer.21,23,24 Pulmonary arterial hypertension has been associated with the use of dasatinib but was
not diagnosed in any of the patients in the sarcoma study.
However, dyspnea, which may be a manifestation of pulmonary arterial hypertension, was reported in 22% of
patients, was severe in 10%, and was attributed to dasatinib in 50% of the cases. The corrected QT interval was
measured during treatment but found to be significantly
lengthened in only 1% of patients and other cardiac
events were rare. Approximately 50% of the patients
required hospitalization for the management of sarcomarelated or drug-related complications during the course of
study treatment; however, there was only 1 death that was
at least possibly attributed to dasatinib. The rates of hematologic toxicities were lower than in patients with CML
who were treated with dasatinib.24

highlight the critical need to identify more effective treatments for patients with advanced sarcoma. Dasatinib treatment failed to achieve a sufficient level of activity in these
groups of patients with high-grade, advanced sarcoma to
warrant a follow-up clinical trial, without further investigation to elucidate the potential molecular etiology behind
the few cases of tumor response and/or prolonged stability,
in any of the sarcoma subtypes studied. Preclinical data suggest that inhibition of SRC may have stronger effects in
preventing tumor invasion and the establishment of metastasis than in controlling cancer growth and survival. An
ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the SRC
inhibitor saracatinib in patients with completely resected
osteosarcoma lung metastases (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT00752206) may help to evaluate this hypothesis.
