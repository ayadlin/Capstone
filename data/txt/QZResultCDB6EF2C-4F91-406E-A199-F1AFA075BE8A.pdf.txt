BACKGROUND. The poor prognosis for elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) raises questions regarding the benefit of treating them with intensive chemotherapy. The impact of initial characteristics on prognosis has been addressed
previously in elderly patients; however, very few data are available regarding the
prognostic value of immunophenotypic characteristics in this setting.

METHODS. The authors investigated expression of the membrane antigens CD13,
CD15, CD33, and CD34 by flow cytometry in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML and analyzed whether these parameters had clinical or prognostic
relevance to help physicians in their choice of therapy.

RESULTS. Immunophenotyping was performed in 273 patients aged 60 years
(median age, 69 years). CD13 was expressed in 73% of patients, CD15 was
expressed in 43% of patients, CD33 was expressed in 64% of patients, and CD34
was expressed in 66% of patients. Complete remission was obtained in 157
patients (58%). The median overall survival was 8.1 months, and the 3-year survival rate was 14%. Three risk groups were defined based on CD34 and CD33
antigen expression: The poor-risk group included patients with CD34-positive/
CD33-positive or CD34-negative/CD33-negative disease, the intermediate-risk
group included patients with CD34-positive/CD33-negative disease, and the
favorable-risk group included patients with CD34-negative/CD33-positive disease.
After cytogenetic analyses, immunophenotype was the most significant prognostic factor in terms of survival in a multivariate analysis (P 5 .03 and P < .0001,
respectively). When immunophenotypic and cytogenetic parameters were combined, patients were classified into 4 prognostic groups: Group A (3-year survival
rate, 33%) included patients with favorable and normal karyotypes who had a
favorable immunophenotype, Group B (3-year survival rte, 28%) included
patients with normal karyotypes who had an intermediate immunophenotype,
Group C (3-year survival rate, 8%) included patients with intermediate or normal
karyotypes who had an unfavorable immunophenotype, and Group D (3-year
survival rate, 2%) included all patients who had unfavorable cytogenetics.

CONCLUSIONS. Immunophenotypic characteristics appeared to be a major prognostic factor in this population of elderly patients with AML. By using 2 simple
parameters assessed at the time of diagnosis, the authors devised a prognostic
system of immediate clinical utility for prognostic stratification and risk-adapted
therapeutic choices. Cancer 2008;112:572–80.  2007 American Cancer Society.

ration. Many associations have been described
between individual antigen expression on myeloid
blasts and prognosis.1 The markers with significant
prognostic value that have been identified in more
than 1 study are CD13,2–4 CD14,2,5–7 and CD15.4,8
CD13 is expressed on the blast cells in the majority of
patients (95%) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).9
The percentage of CD13 expression is a significant
predictive factor for achieving complete remission
(CR).2,4 CD14 is expressed on the blast cells in many
patients with AML, particularly those who have monocytic differentiation.6,8 CD14 expression has been correlated with a poorer outcome, a reduced CR rate,10
and a shorter survival.7 CD15 is expressed on maturing cells of the monocytic lineage and more weakly on
maturing cells of the granulocyte lineage, and it has
been associated with a higher CR rate.4,8,11 Other markers for which claims of prognostic significance have
been made, either alone or in combination, have not
been confirmed in other studies. Among these are
CD33, which is expressed on the blast cells in the majority of patients (91%) with AML9 but which subsequently was not confirmed to have prognostic
significance. Stem cell markers have demonstrated
prognostic significance in AML. CD34 is expressed on
the blast cells in many patients (42%) with AML.10
Positive CD34 status has been correlated significantly
with a lower CR rate in more than 1 study.7,12–14 This
correlation may be related to the association of CD34
expression with a higher incidence of secondary AML
or a history of a pre-existing hematologic disorder and
a higher incidence of chromosomal abnormalities
involving chromosomes 5 and 7. The majority of those
studies addressed the prognostic value of individual
markers rather than of combinations or markers. It is
likely that expression profiles of multiple antigens
have a more significant relation to prognosis than the
profiles of individual antigens.
Elderly patients with AML generally have a poor
prognosis. Several studies have addressed the outcome of elderly patients with AML, and many
authors believe that it may be acceptable to offer
certain patients either exclusive supportive care, lowintensity therapy, or investigational strategies rather
than intensive chemotherapy.15,16 In this setting, several groups have analyzed the significance of pretreatment host- and leukemia-related characteristics
on prognosis.17–22 However, to our knowledge very
little is known regarding antigen expression on leukemic cells in this patient population. Therefore, in the
current study, our objective was to investigate the
expression of the membrane-differentiation antigens
CD13, CD15, CD33, and CD34 in elderly patients
with newly diagnosed AML and to determine the

573

prognostic value of these markers to help physicians
in their choice of therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Four hundred thirty-two adult patients with newly
diagnosed AML (other than M3 subtypes) aged > 60
years who presented with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status < 3 were
included at our institution in first-line therapy clinical
trials between March 1988 and December 2004.
Among them, 273 patients (63%) who had an immunophenotypic analysis performed at diagnosis,
including evaluations of CD13, CD15, CD33, and
CD34 membrane antigen expression, were eligible for
the current study. Diagnosis was based on MayGruenwald-Giemsa-stained bone marrow smears and
cytochemistry according to the French-AmericanBritish (FAB) Group criteria.23 All patients with AML
received an anthracycline- and cytarabine-based
induction chemotherapy regimen. Different protocols
were administered according to the period of study
and have been reported elsewhere.24–28 Anthracyclines were given over 3 or 4 days. Patients received
either mitoxantrone (7 or 8 mg/m2 daily; n 5 129
patients), daunorubicin (30 or 45 mg/m2 daily; n 5 69
patients), or idarubicin (8 or 9 mg/m2 daily; n 5 74
patients). Cytarabine was given for 7 days at a dose of
100 or 200 mg/m2 daily. One hundred fifty-two
patients also received etoposide (100 mg/m2 daily) for
3 days. All protocols were reviewed and approved by
the relevant ethical committees and were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. All
patients who were included in these trials provided
informed consent according to French legislation.
Bone marrow response status was determined by
bone marrow aspirates between Days 28 and 35 of
induction chemotherapy. Patients who did not
achieve complete remission (CR) after 1 course of
chemotherapy, as determined by evaluating the persistence of blasts in bone marrow aspirates, received
salvage therapy according to the protocol design in
which they were included. One hundred twenty-one
patients with CR after induction or salvage received
postremission continuation therapy according to the
protocol design in which they were included. One
hundred four patients followed a chemotherapy program (83 received consolidation courses, and 21
received maintenance courses). Adjustments were
made to the dose or timing of consolidation therapy
only under exceptional circumstances. Seventeen
patients underwent autologous stem cell transplantation as postremission therapy.26,29

CR and disease recurrence were defined according to the National Cancer Institute criteria.30 CR
was defined according to standard criteria as < 5%
blasts in bone marrow aspirates with evidence of
maturation of cell lines and restoration of peripheral
blood counts. Hematologic recurrence was defined
as >5% blasts observed in 2 bone marrow aspirates
obtained at a 15-day interval.

Immunostaining and Flow Cytometry
The immunophenotype was determined in erythrocyte-lysed, whole ethylenediamine tetracetic acid
bone marrow samples that were obtained at diagnosis. Cell surface antigens were detected by direct immunofluorescence according to standard procedures.
Antigenic expression of leukemic cells was analyzed
by multiparametric flow cytometry using triple and
quadruple staining with the following fluorochromeconjugated monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs): fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), peridinin-chlorophyll protein cyanine 5.5 (PerCP-Cy5.5),
and allophycocyanine (APC). The acquisition and
analysis of data were performed on a FACS Calibur
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif)
using a CellQuest Pro software for subsequent data
analysis. At least 20,000 events per tube were measured. Data were acquired in linear mode for side
scatter and in log mode for the fluorescent signal.
The panel included 3-color and 4-color combinations
of markers using CD45 markers in each combination
to allow primary gating of bone marrow blast cells
based on CD45 expression and side scatter. The blast
cells were defined as CD45 low/SSC low. Expression
of each marker was characterized by the percentage
of cells that expressed the marker with the fluorescence level exceeding a background threshold compared with an isotype control. The results were
expressed as the percentages of positive cells. Markers of surface antigens routinely were considered
positive when 20% cells were positive compared
with an isotype control.
CD34 expression was assessed by using APCand PE-conjugated MoAb (581 [Immunotech] and
HPCA2-AG12 [Becton Dickinson], respectively). CD33
expression was assessed by using PE-conjugated
MoAb (P67.6; Becton Dickinson), CD15 expression
was assessed by using FITC-conjugated MoAb
(VIMC6; Invitrogen), and CD13 expressed was
assessed by using PE-conjugated MoAb (TuK1; Invitrogen).
Statistical Analysis
Positivity for a given marker was determined either
when 20% of cells were positive or when the me-

dian value of fluorescence intensity was above a
threshold value. According to standard criteria, samples were considered positive when the percentage
of stained cells exceeded that of the control by
20%. However, in the statistical analysis, antigen
expression levels were analyzed as continuous variables. The relations between expression of membrane-differentiation antigens and quantitative
characteristics (white blood cell count, hemoglobin
level, platelet count, percentage of circulating and
bone marrow blasts, lactate dehydrogenase level)
were studied with the Spearman rank-correlation
test. The relations between expression of membrane
antigens and qualitative parameters (sex, World
Health Organization performance status, patient history, splenomegaly, fever at diagnosis, cytogenetics,
FAB classification) were determined with the MannWhitney test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Associations
between pretreatment characteristics and response
to induction therapy were evaluated with the Pearson
chi-square test. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (95% CIs) of CR proportions were calculated by
using the exact binomial formula. Overall survival
(OS) was calculated from the day of registration until
death or last follow-up. Disease-free survival (DFS)
was calculated from the date of CR until recurrence,
the date of death, or the date of last follow-up. Survival durations were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier
method, and their symmetrical 95% CIs were calculated according to the Greenwood method. Survival
curves were compared by using the log-rank test.
Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox
proportional hazards model for DFS and OS to
obtain the estimate and the 95% CI of the hazard ratio of 1 group of patients versus another group, and
the Wald test was used to determine the prognostic
significance. All P values indicated are 2-tailed and
are considered statistically significant if P < .05.
Computations were performed by using the BMDP
PC90 statistical program (BMDP Statistical Software,
Los Angeles, Calif).

RESULTS
Patients
We studied 273 elderly patients with newly diagnosed
AML before induction chemotherapy. The median
follow-up of this cohort was 5 years (95% CI, 4.3–6
years). The main patient characteristics are provided
in Table 1. There were 138 men and 135 women. The
median age was 69 years (range, 60–82 years).
According to the FAB morphologic classification,
15 patients (5%) had M0 disease, 55 patients (20%)
had M1 disease, 65 patients (24%) had M2 disease,

to 98% (median, 38%).

Expression of Membrane-differentiation Antigens
on Leukemic Cells
The expression levels of the membrane-differentiation antigens studied are provided in Table 2. CD13
expression ranged from 0% to 99% of blast cells (median, 66% of blast cells), and 199 of 273 patients with
AML (73%) exhibited percentages 20%. CD15
expression ranged from 0% to 99% of blast cells (median, 15% of blast cells), and 112 of 261 patients who
were tested (43%) exhibited percentages 20%. CD33
expression ranged from 0% to 99% of leukemic cells
(median, 51% of leukemic cells), and 175 patients
(64%) exhibited 20% positive cells. CD34 expression
ranged from 0% to 99% of blast cells (median, 46%
of blast cells), and with 173 of 263 patients tested
(66%) exhibited percentages 20%. Significant correlations were observed between the expression of the
4 antigens tested: CD34 positivity was more likely to
be associated with CD13-positive expression than
with CD13-negative expression (P 5 .0004), more
likely to be associated with CD15-negative expression
than with CD15-positive expression (P 5 .003), and
more likely to be associated with CD33-negative
expression than with CD33-positive expression
(P 5 .0005); CD33 positivity was more likely to be
associated with CD13-positive expression than with

except for CD34, which was expressed more in
patients with M0 leukemia, and CD15, which was
expressed less in patients with M6 and M7 leukemias. Expression levels of CD15 and of CD33 were
correlated with a history of toxic exposure (P 5 .0002
and P 5 .03, respectively). CD33 expression was
higher in women than in men (72% vs 56%;
P 5 .008). A history of myelodysplastic syndrome was
correlated with CD33 negativity (P 5 .0007) and
CD34 positivity (P 5 .009). Cytogenetic groups were
correlated significantly with CD34 expression only
(P 5 .0003).

CD13-negative expression (P 5 .003) and was more
likely to be associated with CD15-positive expression
than with CD14-negative expression (P 5 .04).
When considering only CD34-positive patients,
there was a trend toward better outcomes for patients
who did not coexpress CD33 compared with patients
who did coexpress CD33. In contrast, when considering only CD34-negative patients, there was a trend toward better outcomes for CD33-positive patients
compared with CD33-negative patients. In both
groups, no differences were noted regarding the expression of CD15 or CD13. This allowed us to define
4 patient populations: CD34-positive/CD33-positive
patients, CD34-negative/CD33-positive patients, CD34negative/CD33-negative patients, and CD34-positive/
CD33-negative patients, which we divided into 3 prognostic groups in terms of survival: Group 1 (poor
immunophenotypic risk) with CD34-positive/CD33positive or CD34-negative/CD33-negative disease,
Group 2 (intermediate immunophenotypic risk) with
CD34-positive/CD33-negative disease, and Group 3
(favorable immunophenotypic risk) with CD34-negative/CD33-positive disease (Fig. 1). When we analyzed
patients according to our cytogenetic classification,
these prognostic groups were significantly confirmed
only in patients with normal karyotype (P 5 .005).

Correlations Between Expression of Differentiation
Antigens and Treatment Outcome
CR was obtained in 157 of 273 patients with AML
(58%; 95% CI, 51%–63%) after 1 or 2 courses of
induction chemotherapy. CR rates were higher in
patients with lower expression of CD34 (76% vs 49%;
P < .0001). Negative expression of CD34 (74% vs
46%; P 5 .0002) and positive expression of CD15
(60% vs 51%; P 5 .02) also were associated significantly with higher CR rates after 1 course of induction therapy. The other factors that had prognostic
value regarding CR achievement were a history of
myelodysplastic syndrome (42% vs 61%; P 5 .02), the
presence of splenomegaly (47% vs 60%; P 5 .02), and
cytogenetics (90% for favorable-risk cytogenetics vs
63% for intermediate-risk cytogenetics vs 38% for
unfavorable-risk cytogenetics; P 5 .001).
The median DFS of the 157 responders was 8.2
months (95% CI, 6.9–10 months), and the 5-year DFS
rate was 14%. Isolated differentiation antigen expression did not reveal any prognostic value in terms of
DFS. Only cytogenetics appeared to be prognostic for
DFS (P 5 .0008).
The median OS for the entire cohort was 8.1
months (95% CI, 6.7–10.6 months): The 3-year OS
rate was 14%, and the 5-year OS rate was 11%. Isolated differentiation antigen expression did not reveal
any significant prognostic value in terms of OS. However, OS tended to be longer in patients with lower
expression of CD34 (median OS, 11.9 months vs 7.9
months; P 5 .06) than in patients with positive
expression of CD34. A history of myelodysplastic
syndrome was an adverse prognostic factor for OS
(P 5 .04). Cytogenetics also had prognostic value for
OS (P < .0001) (Fig. 2).

Correlations Between Expression of Differentiation
Antigens and Patient Characteristics
The expression of membrane-differentiation antigens
was not correlated significantly with FAB subtypes

Multivariate Analysis for Prognostic Variables
In multivariate analysis, a model was constructed to
evaluated the prognostic significance of cytogenetics,
a history of myelodysplasia, and immunophenotypic
risk, according to the risk groups defined above.

FIGURE 1. Overall survival (OS) according to the 3 prognostic groups
defined by CD34 and CD33 expression: Group 1 (poor immunophenotypic
risk) was comprised of patients (Pts) with CD34-positive/CD33-positive or
CD34-negative/CD33-negative disease, Group 2 (intermediate immunophenotypic risk) was comprised of patients with CD34-positive/CD33-negative disease, and Group 3 (favorable immunophenotypic risk) was comprised of
patients with CD34-negative/CD33-positive disease.

FIGURE 2. Overall survival (OS) according to cytogenetics. Cytogenetic
analyses were performed in 244 patients (Pts). Acute myeloid leukemia with
normal karyotypes constituted a specific group. The favorable-risk group was
comprised of patients with t(8;21) and chromosome 16 abnormalities. The
unfavorable-risk group involved monosomies or deletions of chromosomes 5
and 7, abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 3, or complex cytogenetic abnormalities (defined as 5 unrelated cytogenetic clones). The intermediate-risk group corresponded to all other chromosomal abnormalities
that were not defined as favorable or unfavorable. According to this cytogenetic classification, only patients from the favorable-risk group (4% of the
entire cohort) have a reasonable outcome with a 2-year survival rate of
approximately 40% and appear to be ‘‘fit for intensive chemotherapy.’’

Cytogenetics (P < .0001) and immunophenotypic risk
group (P 5 .03) conserved prognostic value in terms
of OS. Results of the Cox model regarding OS according to cytogenetics and immunophenotyping subgroups are provided in Table 3.
By using these significant parameters, we devised
a prognostic system of immediate clinical utility for
prognostic stratification and risk-adapted therapeutic
choice. Patients were classified in 4 prognostic
groups, taking into account karyotypic grouping at
diagnosis and significant antigen expression in the
multivariate analysis adapted to each cytogenetic
group: Group A (median OS, 18.5 months; 3-year OS,
33%) included all patients with favorable karyotypes
and patients with normal karyotypes that displayed a
favorable immunophenotype (Group 3), Group B
(median OS, 16 months; 3-year OS, 28%) included
patients with normal karyotypes that displayed an
intermediate immunophenotype (Group 2), Group C
(median OS, 8.4 months; 3-year OS, 8%) included all
patients with intermediate cytogenetics and those
with a normal karyotype that displayed an unfavorable immunophenotype (Group 3), and Group D
(median OS, 4.5 months; 3-year OS, 3%) included all
patients with unfavorable cytogenetics (Fig. 3). In the

Group B > 2.5 years after diagnosis, whereas a plateau was observed in Group A.

DISCUSSION
Life expectancy in elderly patients with AML is a
function of age, disability, and comorbidity along
with the characteristics of leukemia itself. The objective of any preliminary evaluation of elderly patients
with AML should be to distinguish the frail patients
from the others. Until now, most clinical trials have
taken into account measures of performance status
and comorbidity assessment to select patients for intensive chemotherapy. Overall outcome in this
patient population is very poor, however, suggesting
that this means of selection is not adapted and
should take into account other criteria. In this setting, combinations of cell surface myeloid antigen
expression were studied for their prognostic value.

FIGURE 3. Prognostic system of immediate clinical utility for prognostic
stratification and risk-adapted therapeutic choices. Patients were classified
in 4 prognostic groups taking into account karyotypic grouping at diagnosis
and immonophenotypic risk subgroup: Group A included patients with favorable karyotype and those with a normal karyotype that displayed a favorable
immunophenotype (Group 3); Group B included patients with a normal karyotype that displayed an intermediate immunophenotype (Group 2); Group C
included patients with intermediate cytogenetics and those with a normal
karyotype that displayed an unfavorable immunophenotype (Group 1); and
Group D included patients with unfavorable cytogenetics. The combination of
cytogenetics and immunophenotype appears to be more accurate than the
prognostication of cytogenetics alone. It adds more patients (26% of the
entire cohort) into the cohort of patients who have a reasonable outcome
with 2-year survival rates of approximately 40% and who should be encourage to receive intensive chemotherapy. OS indicates overall survival.

To our knowledge, the current study is the largest
series regarding immunophenotyping ever reported
in elderly patients with AML. Among the 4 antigens
that we studied, only the combination of CD34
and CD33 defined immunophenotypic groups that
had prognostic value. CD33-positive/CD34-negative
patients had the best prognosis. CD34-positive/
CD33-negative patients were in the intermediate-risk
category, and both CD34-positive/CD33-positive and
CD34-negative/CD33-negative patient populations
had very poor outcomes. It was demonstrated previously that most leukemic progenitors of CD34-positive patients did not express CD33, whereas only
normal progenitors were detected from CD34-negative patients with AML who expressed CD33.31 The
very poor outcome of patient populations with dual
negativity or positivity of both markers cannot be
explained but certainly would benefit from further
molecular studies.
The limitations in our study were represented by
its retrospective nature and the long interval during
which different therapies were administered. However, the homogeneity of chemotherapy regimens

over the past 2 decades and inclusion criteria into
the different regimens, the maturity of follow-up,
and the absence of survival results over time (data
not shown) resulted in few interactions between various regimens and phenotypic characteristics.
In addition, our results confirmed cytogenetics
as the major prognostic factor in an elderly AML
patient population,18,32,33 confirming that disease
biology rather than age is the most important determinant of survival in this patient population.34 Cytogenetic studies have acquired major prognostic
importance in the therapy of AML. Our results indicated that cytogenetics should be made readily available for treatment decisions in this elderly patient
population. However, cytogenetics only allowed identification of a very small group of patients with a
favorable long-term outcome.
In this setting immunophenotyping may complete cytogenetic data, and a combination of both
factors could be used to guide a more focused
approach to the treatment of elderly patients. Combining these 2 factors allowed us to defining 4 prognostic groups. The larger groups had delayed (Group
C) or immediate (Group D) poor outcomes. It is reasonable that such patients (‘not fit for intensive
chemotherapy’), who constitute approximately 74%
of elderly patients with AML, would be considered
for alternative, low-intensity, or investigational therapies. Because of their rapid unfavorable evolution,
patients from Group D also could be directed immediately to palliation. Conversely, approximately 26%
of elderly patients who do not have those adverse
factors have reasonable outcomes, with 2-year survival rates of approximately 40%, and should be
encouraged to receive intensive chemotherapy.
Therefore, Groups A and B, which represented 18%
and 8%, of the entire cohort, respectively, included
elderly patients who actually are ‘fit for intensive
chemotherapy.’ However, a difference was observed
between these 2 groups of patients in long-term follow-up: Group A achieved a plateau, whereas some
patients in Group B still developed disease recurrence after 2 years.
In summary, our data confirm that the vast majority of elderly patients with AML cannot be rescued
using current, standard, intensive chemotherapy,
even when they are selected for clinical trials in
which entry is defined by performance status and
the absence of severe factors of comorbidity. Combined with cytogenetics, immunophenotyping may
help in the identification of subsets of patients for
whom the best possible results with intensive chemotherapy can be obtained. Other patients most likely
would benefit more from palliative treatment aimed

at the best possible quality of life or may be included
