ABSTRACT
Purpose
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of nab-paclitaxel
plus gemcitabine (NAB-P/GEM) regimen in an unselected population of patients
with advanced inoperable or metastatic pancreatic cancer (PC), and to identify the
prognostic factors influencing overall survival (OS).

Experimental design
Patients with age < 85 years, ECOG-performance status (PS) < 3, and adequate
renal, hepatic and hematologic function were eligible. NAB-P (125 mg/m2) and GEM
(1000 mg/m2) day 1,8,15 every 4 weeks were employed for 3–6 cycles or until
highest response.

Results
Overall, 147 cycles (median 4, range 1–11 cycles) were administered on thirtyseven consecutive patients (median 66 years old, range 40–82) treated. The median
overall progression-free survival and OS were 6.2 and 9.2 months, respectively. The
G 3–4 dose-limiting toxicity were neutropenia (20.7%), severe anemia (17.2%), and
cardiovascular toxicity (10.3%). PS, number of cycles, baseline CA 19–9 and LDH
serum levels, were found to be significantly related to OS. The multivariate analysis
showed that both number of cycles (HR = 9.14, 95% CI 1.84–45.50, p = 0.001) and
PS (HR = 13.18, 95% CI 2.73–63.71, p = 0.001) were independently associated
with OS.

Conclusion
NAB-P/GEM regimen should be used in all patients with advanced or metastatic
PC, with the exception of those with serious contraindications to chemotherapy, such
as severe renal or hepatic impairment or major cardiovascular diseases.

INTRODUCION

Patients underwent baseline standard hematological
check-up, including complete blood cell count, bilirubin,
creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which
were assayed using laboratory routine methods. Serum
carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 was measured using
a commercially available immunoassay by automated
heterogeneous chemiluminescent immunoassays that use
N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) as luminescence
substrate (Maglumi, Shenzen New Industries Biomedical
Engineering, SNIBE, Shenzen, China).
Overall, the median baseline CA 19–9 level was 1734
U/mL (range 2–120,000 U/mL), while the median values of
hemoglobin, white blood cells (WBC), ALP and LDH were
12 g/dL, 7230/μL, 136 U/L and 205 U/L, respectively.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive tumor that
accounts for approximately 3% of all cancers, whose
incidence is increasing [1]. It represents the fourth
leading cause of cancer death in the United States in
both gender. PC remains a chemoresistant malignancy
and the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine, which has
represented for years the standard first-line therapy for
patients with PC, provides limited clinical benefits,
especially in advanced or metastatic disease [2, 3]. The
prognosis of patients with PC is poor and their 5-year
overall survival (OS) rate is only 5%, as approximately
80% of patients are diagnosed when the disease has
already given regional or distant metastases [1, 4].
Several alternative drugs have been tested, alone or in
combination with gemcitabine, including oxaliplatin,
capecitabine, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5FU), erlotinib
and bevacizumab, but none has significantly improved
OS [5–10].
Two four-drug regimens, named PEFG (cisplatin,
epirubicin, fluorouracil, gemcitabine) and FOLFIRINOX
(folinic acid, 5FU, irinotecan, oxaliplatin), have been
shown to give better results towards gemcitabine alone
[11, 12]. More recently, a multicentric study comparing
nab-paclitaxel (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel)
plus gemcitabine (NAB-P/GEM) versus gemcitabine
alone, reported significant survival benefit (1-year OS
rate 35% vs. 22%) of this new regimen, offering another
possibility in the management of patents with PC [13].
However, the exclusion criteria adopted in the selection
of patients (i.e., Karnofsky performance-status score < 70
on a scale from zero to 100, no previous chemotherapy
for metastatic disease), restrict the use of this treatment
protocol.
The purposes of the present study were (i) to
evaluate the effectiveness of NAB-P/GEM regimen
in an unselected population of patients with advanced
inoperable or metastatic PC and (ii) to identify the
prognostic factors influencing OS.

Toxicity and antitumor activity
We obtained complete response in three (10.3%)
and partial response in four (13.8%) out of 29 evaluable
patients, whilst 16 (55.2%) and six (20.7%) patients
had stable disease or progressive disease, respectively.
The overall objective response rate and disease control
rate were 19% (95% CI, 8%–30%) and 62% (95% CI,
55%–69%), respectively, and the median duration of
response was 8 months (range 1–9 months). The median
overall progression-free survival (PFS) and OS were 6.2
and 9.2 months, respectively (Figure 1A–1B). The grade
(G) 3–4 dose-limiting toxicity were neutropenia in six
(20.7%), severe anemia in five (17.2%), thrombocytopenia
in two (6.9%), signs and symptoms of neurological
and cardiovascular toxicity in three (10.3%) and one
(3.4%) patients, respectively. One more patient (3.4%)
complained of fatigue. Eight (21.6%) patients were not
evaluable for early suspension.
The results of the univariate analysis are shown
in Table 1. ECOG-PS (0–1 vs. 2), number of cycles
(<  4  vs.  ≥  4), baseline CA 19–9 (< 1734 vs. ≥ 1734 U/
mL) and LDH (< 204 vs. ≥ 204 U/L) serum levels, were
found to be significantly related to OS (Figure 2A–2D). The
multivariate analysis showed that both number of cycles
(HR = 9.14, 95% CI 1.84–45.50, p = 0.001 for < 4 vs. ≥
4  cycles) and PS (HR = 13.18, 95% CI 2.73–63.71,
p  = 0.001 for 2 vs. 0–1 ECOG-PS) were independently
associated with OS.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
A series of 37 consecutive patients (20 males,
17  females; median 66 years old, range 40–82) with
locally advanced unresectable primary tumor (N = 6,
16.2%) or metastatic (N = 31, 83.8%) PC were enrolled in
the study. The local institutional ethics committee obtained
written informed consent from all participants before
therapy started and the study had full ethical approval. All
patients were evaluated according to Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) protocol
that uses a scale from 0 to 5, with higher score indicating
illness or a very poor PS [14].

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic cancer remains a very serious disease,
characterized by a poor prognosis, for which a multidrug
therapy is usually more effective than monotherapy. In a
group of patients with PC who underwent FOLFIRINOX
regimen versus gemcitabine alone, the median OS
was 11.1 vs. 6.8 months (HR = 0.57, p < 0.001) and
the median PFS was 6.4 vs. 3.3 months (HR = 0.47,
p < 0.001) compared to the control group [12, 15].

Unfortunately, FOLFIRINOX increases gastrointestinal
and neurosensorial toxicity, thus reducing the quality of
life parameters compared to gemcitabine regimen alone in
patients with metastatic PC [15]. Moreover, the exclusion
criteria of FOLFIRINOX protocol, such as age ≥ 76 years,
ECOG-PS ≥ 2, and site of primary tumor, may partially
justify the longer OS, thus limiting its use in unselected
population of patients with PC [16].
Another effective regimen is NAB-P/GEM that
demonstrates superiority on response rate and PFS over
gemcitabine [13]. Nab-paclitaxel was initially developed
to avoid hypersensitivity phenomena related to solvents
such as polyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL, BASF,
Ludwigshafen, Germany) used as vehicle [17]. In PC with
dense stroma and high levels of secreting protein acidic
and rich in cysteine, the efficacy of NAB-P is higher
because the albumin-binding protein sequestrates NAB-P,
which concentrates within the tumor tissue [18]. It also
synergize with gemcitabine, which increases by 2.8 times
the intratumoral concentration of the drug [19]. NAB-P/
GEM should also be considered as salvage therapy after
ineffective first-line FOLFIRINOX treatment [20].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Using The Quality-Adjusted Time Without
Symptoms or Toxicities (Q-TWiST) methodology it has
been shown that patients treated with NAB-P/GEM have
a significant gain in the quality-adjusted survival, when
compared to those treated with gemcitabine alone [21].
A meta-analysis on studies of patients with metastatic PC
treated with single-agent or combination chemotherapy
regimens, including NAB-P/GEM and FOLFIRINOX,
showed the superiority of multidrug protocols versus
gemcitabine alone and the substantial equivalence between
NAB-P/GEM and FOLFIRINOX [4]. Another review
confirmed that both regimens should be considered the
treatment of choice as first-line chemotherapy in patients
with metastatic PC [22]. The results of our study confirm
the effectiveness of the protocol NAB-P/GEM (PFS =
6.2 months, OS = 9.2 months) also in a population of
unselected patients with advanced or metastatic PC, and
the multivariate analysis showed that both PS and number
of cycles of therapy were independently associated with
OS. This suggests that even patients with PS < 2 may
tolerate a high number of cycles of therapy, which could
enable them to prolong OS.

METHODS

Cox proportional hazard regression linear model
to compare hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence
interval (95% CI). A two-sided p-value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. SAS version 9.20
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA, 2002–2008) was
used for statistical analysis.

Patient selection
Inclusion criteria were the following: (i) age
< 85 years, (ii) ECOG-PS < 3, (iii) histological diagnosis
of pancreatic non-neuroendocrine adenocarcinoma,
(iv) metastatic PC on 18F-2-deoxy-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)
positron-emission tomography/computed tomography
(PET/CT) or locally advanced unresectable primary tumor
on contrast-enhanced CT scan, (v) adequate renal, hepatic
and hematologic function, including serum creatinine
< 1.5 mg/dL, ALT < 2 times upper the limit of the normal
range, hemoglobin ≥  9 g/dL, WBC > 4000/μL, and
absolute neutrophil count > 1500/μL. Patients who had
received adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy or radiation
therapy more than 6 weeks before the start of the study,
were also included.
Exclusion criteria were limited to serious
cardiovascular problems (i.e., heart failure, instable
angina, ventricular arrhythmia, ejection fraction < 50%),
presence of obstructive jaundice or recent replacement of
infected biliary stenting.
There were 29 (78.4%) treatment-naive patients and
8 (21.6%) previously treated patients. Sites of metastases
on PET/CT were liver (N = 21 out of 31, 67.7%), pancreas
(N = 19, 61.3%), peritoneum (N = 13, 41.9%), regional
lymph nodes (N = 10, 32.3%), lung (N = 6, 19.4%) or
other sites (N = 3, 9.7%).

CONCLUSION
NAB-P/GEM should be used in all patients with
advanced or metastatic PC, with the exception of those with
serious contraindications to chemotherapy, such as renal or
hepatic impairment or major cardiovascular diseases. Future
studies, performed on less selected patient populations, are
required to confirm these preliminary outcomes.

Procedures
NAB-P (125 mg/m2) and GEM (1000 mg/m2)
were administered on day 1, 8, 15 every 28 days for
at least 3 cycles. A dose reduction of 25% for patient
with ECOG-PS = 2 was planned at the beginning of
treatment, followed by dose increase if good tolerance
and PS improvement appeared. In the presence of stable
disease or objective response detected on CT scan, the
treatment continued until 6–7 cycles. In presence of
G 3–4 neutropenia, after recovery of toxicity, a secondary
prophylaxis with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
(G-CSF) was employed in the next cycles. In patients
with a higher degree of toxicity (G > 4), recovery to
G ≤ 1 before continuing therapy was required. Overall, 147
cycles (median 4, range 1–11 cycles) were administered.
