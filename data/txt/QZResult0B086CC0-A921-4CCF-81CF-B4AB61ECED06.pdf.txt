ABSTRACT
The healthy effects of plant polyphenols, some of which characterize the socalled Mediterranean diet, have been shown to arise from epigenetic and biological
modifications resulting, among others, in autophagy stimulation. Our previous work
highlighted the beneficial effects of oleuropein aglycone (OLE), the main polyphenol
found in the extra virgin olive oil, against neurodegeneration both in cultured cells
and in model organisms, focusing, in particular, autophagy activation. In this study
we investigated more in depth the molecular and cellular mechanisms of autophagy
induction by OLE using cultured neuroblastoma cells and an OLE-fed mouse model of
amylod beta (Aβ) deposition. We found that OLE triggers autophagy in cultured cells
through the Ca2+-CAMKKβ–AMPK axis. In particular, in these cells OLE induces a rapid
release of Ca2+ from the SR stores which, in turn, activates CAMKKβ, with subsequent
phosphorylation and activation of AMPK. The link between AMPK activation and mTOR
inhibition was shown in the OLE-fed animal model in which we found that decreased
phospho-mTOR immunoreactivity and phosphorylated mTOR substrate p70 S6K levels
match enhanced phospho-AMPK levels, supporting the idea that autophagy activation
by OLE proceeds through mTOR inhibition. Our results agree with those reported
for other plant polyphenols, suggesting a shared molecular mechanism underlying
the healthy effects of these substances against ageing, neurodegeneration, cancer,
diabetes and other diseases implying autophagy dysfunction.

INTRODUCTION

a number of foods of plant origin and believed to be at the
basis of the claimed beneficial properties of these foods
[1]. The wide interest raised around these molecules as
potential tools to combat such a wide range of diseases
or, at least, to reduce the severity of their symptoms
and/or age of occurrence has prompted many groups
to investigate various aspects of their physiological
actions both at the cellular and molecular level and in
animal models of a number of pathological conditions,
particularly cancer, inflammatory, cardiovascular and
neurodegenerative diseases [2,3]. A number of shared

An increasing body of evidence points to a
number of natural polyphenols as protective tools
against cell sufferance and death in a wide number of
human pathologies spanning from neurodegenerative to
cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes, including
ageing. These molecules include compounds such as
resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), curcumin,
morin, quercetin and oleuropein aglycone (OLE) found in

properties of these compounds includes their anti-oxidant,
anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic power, and
many benefits following their intake have been rationalised
in the light of these recognised effects. However, more
recently, other properties of these compounds arising from
their interaction with cellular systems and potentially
explaining their beneficial effects have been described.
One of these is their ability to raise, in a number of
different cell types, the autophagic response involved in
protection against neurodegeneration, liver and vascular
diseases [4-6].
Autophagy is a key process involved in cell
homeostasis of proteins (proteostasis), lipids and
organelles and contributes to clear materials of
endogenous or exogenous origin. Together with the
ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy participates to
cellular proteostasis as one of the two main pathways of
intracellular proteolysis, even though the former applies
to the short-lived intracellular proteins, whereas the latter
concerns proteins with longer half-lives. Autophagy
encompasses the different routes used by cells to deliver
cytoplasmic substrates to lysosomes through the formation
of autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with lysosomes
to form autophagolysosomes [7]. Usually, autophagy is
triggered upon starvation, however it can be activated
also by the presence of deposited materials as well as to
degrade aged cellular organelles, principally mitochondria
(mitophagy). Autophagy efficiency declines with age, with
consequent accumulation of harmful protein aggregates
and damaged mitochondria, which leads to increased ROS
production [8]. The resulting increased cell stress favors
inflammation and cell death [9].
Canonical
autophagy,
also
known
as
macroautophagy, is a highly conserved process shared by
all organisms which can be triggered in different ways and
requires the participation of over 20 ATG proteins in yeast.
The most straightforward path requires the inhibition of
a cytoplasmic kinase receptor, the mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR forms two functionally
distinct protein-mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and
mTORC2) that are at the centre of an intricate, and
still incompletely described, signalling pathway that is
activated in response to a number of stress stimuli [10].
At the onset of the process, these complexes control the
activation of the autophagy-initiating kinase (ULK1).
mTORC1 inactivation in response to nutrient deprivation
results in the activation of the ULK1 complex with
ensuing induction of autophagy [7]. Autophagy senses,
among others, the energy status of the cell and therefore
responds to any cytosolic alteration of the AMP/ATP ratio
which, in turn, signals to a number of kinases including
liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and adenosine monophosphatedependent protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is activated
upon phosphorylation by a number of upstream kinases
including LKB1 and calmodulin-dependent kinase
kinase β (CaMKKβ ), the latter in response to free Ca2+
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increase, following the stimulation of the cAMP-inositol
1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)/Akt and calpain-G-stimulatory
protein α (Gsα) pathways [11]. In turn, activated AMPK
promotes autophagy by phosphorylation and activation of
ULK1 [12] and inhibition of mTORC1 .
Autophagy abnormalities may contribute to many
different pathophysiological conditions [13]; thus
autophagy is increasingly considered as a promising
target to treat a number of pathologies, particularly those
associated with neurodegeneration [10] as well as ageing
[14]. Actually, increased mTOR activity has been reported
in cellular and animal models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
[15] as well as in Huntington animal models and disease
[16, 17]; inducing autophagy can also be beneficial in
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [18].
Plant polyphenols are able to regulate autophagy
in several ways. In particular, some polyphenols, such as
resveratrol and EGCG, appear to promote the autophagic
pathway by increasing cytosolic Ca2+ levels and activating
AMPK by the CaMKKβ [4-6, 8]. Our previous data have
highlighted the beneficial effects of OLE against protein/
peptide aggregation in vitro [19, 20]. More importantly,
our findings showed that TgCRND8 mice, a strain widely
used as a model of amylod beta (Aβ) peptide deposition,
fed with OLE displayed strongly improved performance in
behavioural and cognitive tests; this effect was paralleled
by reduced plaque load and plaque disassembly, in the
affected brain areas, reduced inflammatory response,
recovered dysfunctions of transgene-induced long-term
potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 hippocampal area and
reduced production of the pyro-Glu-Aβ 3-42 peptide,
a recognised amyloid nucleator. These effects were, at
least in part, accompanied and explained by epigenetic
modifications [21] and, most remarkably, by a strong
activation of autophagy [22, 23]. Autophagy stimulation
by OLE agrees with the data previously reported for
other plant polyphenols [24, 25], however, at variance
with those, our data did not highlight any mechanistic
explanation. To fill this gap and to expand the knowledge
in the field not only in cultured cells but also in model
animals, we investigated the molecular and cellular
mechanisms of autophagy induction by OLE both in vitro
in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in vivo in TgCRND8
mice.

RESULTS
OLE induces a biphasic increase in AMPK
phosphorylation at its regulatory Thr172
We previously showed that diet supplementation
with OLE strongly ameliorates AD-associated symptoms
in TgCRND8 mice, a model of Aβ deposition, in several
ways, including induction of autophagy [21-23]; a similar

behaviour was also shown in OLE-treated murine N2a
neuroblastoma cells [23]. We therefore sought to elucidate
the molecular mechanism underlying autophagy activation
by investigating at which level OLE interfered with the
autophagy cascade in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma
cells. Previous data suggested that other polyphenols, such
as resveratrol and EGCG, promote the autophagy flux
by increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ levels with subsequent
activation of AMPK by CaMKKβ [4-6]. Therefore, our
primary aim was to assess if the molecular mechanism
of autophagy induction in OLE-exposed SH-SY5Y cells
was similar to that previously reported for other natural
polyphenols. To do this, we initially exposed the cells to 50
μM OLE for 24 h, the conditions we previously reported
to trigger autophagy in N2a cells [23] and then checked
the cells for both Beclin-1 level (whose increase is an
early marker of autophagy) and AMPK phosphorylation.
However, no variation in the phosphorylation of the
AMPK catalytic subunit at the regulatory Thr172 residue
was observed at these conditions in spite of a significant
increase in Beclin-1 expression (Figure 1A).
This negative result prompted us to explore whether

an hypothetical OLE-mediated AMPK activation was an
early event that disappeared after 24 h of cell treatment.
In order to reduce the time frame of our treatments, at
first we checked if autophagy was induced in SH-SY5Y
cells after only 4 h of cell treatment with 50 μM OLE. At
these conditions, autophagic vacuoles staining was evident
suggesting that autophagy was indeed triggered even at
this short time of treatment (Figure 1B). Accordingly, we
analysed the phosphorylation level of AMPK within this
time interval. We observed a biphasic significant increase
of AMPK phosphorylation with respect to vehicle-treated
cells after both 10’ and 4 h of OLE treatment (Figure 1C),
supporting a close relation between autophagy induction
and AMPK phosphorylation following cell exposure to
OLE for reduced time periods.

OLE induces a biphasic increase of the
intracellular Ca2+levels
It is well known that AMPK phosphorylation
can result from the activation of the Ca2+-dependent

Ser-Thr kinase CaMKKβ, a mechanism that accounts
for autophagy induction by resveratrol and EGCG [46]. Therefore, we sought to explore whether, in our
conditions, CaMKKβ was indeed involved even in the
relation between cell treatment with OLE and the ensuing
AMPK phosphorylation. To this purpose, we investigated
the trend of the increase of intracellular free Ca2+ in OLEtreated cells to check whether it was associated to the
biphasic character of AMPK phosphorylation. By using the
fluorescent probe Fluo3-AM we found an early increase
of the cytosolic Ca2+ after 5’-10’ of OLE treatment, with
a subsequent decrease at 30’ (yet significantly above the
basal level) followed by a late increase after 1- 2 h, while
after 5 h the Ca2+ level was no more significantly different
from the basal level (Figure 2). These data suggested a
temporal correlation between cytosolic Ca2+ increase and
AMPK phosphorylation in OLE-treated cells.

Then, we focused at the early peak of Ca2+ increase
and checked whether, in OLE-treated cells, the increased
Ca2+ came from the extracellular medium or it was released
from the intracellular stores. To do this, the cells, before
treatment with OLE for 10 min, were incubated for 30
min with the cell-impermeant Ca2+ chelator EGTA or with
CPA, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+
pump which causes depletion of the ER stores. At these
conditions, we found that only CPA abolished the OLEinduced Ca2+ increase, whereas cell treatment with EGTA
did not induce any significant effect (Figure 3), suggesting
that the free Ca2+ increase in OLE-treated cells resulted
from ER release. We concluded that, in OLE-treated cells,
AMPK phosphorylation paralleled Ca2+ increase coming
from the ER, which suggested a pivotal role of the Ca2+activated CaMKKβ.

with 50 µM OLE for different time periods. At the end of each treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min at 37

CaMKKβ activation is needed for OLEautophagy induction

suggesting that autophagy activation resulting from Ca2+
release from the ER in OLE-treated cells is an early
event, and that longer times of incubation with OLE are
not needed for autophagy induction. In fact, the latter
was absent in cells pre-treated with CPA, confirming
that Ca2+ release from the ER induced by a short acute
(10 min) stimulus by OLE is essential for autophagy
activation. We also confirmed the involvement of the
Ca2+-activated CaMKKβ in such signalling cascade, since
cell pre-treatment with STO-609 abolished OLE-induced
increase of autophagic vacuoles staining. On the contrary,
cell pre-treatment with EGTA did not inhibit autophagy,
suggesting that the extracellular Ca2+ plays a minor role in
the signalling cascade, at least in cells treated with OLE
for short time periods.
The above findings are supported by the analysis
of the time course of Beclin-1 expression that showed a
slight, yet significant, transitory increase during the first
minutes of OLE treatment, reaching a peak at 30 min
(Figure 5B). Considering the short time of incubation
with OLE, it is unlikely that such an increase stems from
raised synthesis; rather it could arise from the Beclin-1
fraction complexed with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL in the cytoplasm.
Actually, release of Beclin-1 from its complex with Bcl-2
is critical for inducing autophagy as free Beclin-1- VPS34
interaction is needed to initiate autophagosome formation

To investigate whether CaMKKβ activation was
indeed involved in the OLE-triggered AMPK activation,
the cells were incubated with STO-609, a CAMKKβ
inhibitor, prior to treatment with OLE for 10 min or 4
h. The subsequent western blotting analysis showed
that, when CaMKKβ was inhibited, the level of AMPK
phosphorylation was significantly lower than that
measured both in the presence of OLE and in the absence
of STO-609 and did not differed significantly from that
found in OLE-untreated controls (Figure 4).
The above reported data suggest that cell treatment
with OLE for 10 min induces a rise of free Ca2+ coming
from the ER stores, which results in CaMKKβ activation
and subsequent AMPK phosphorylation. Therefore, we
investigated whether such a short-time treatment was
sufficient to trigger autophagy and, if so, whether Ca2+
increase and CaMKKβ activation did play a role. So, the
cells were pre-treated with EGTA, CPA or STO-609 for
30 min and then incubated with OLE for 10 min. Then the
cells were washed and incubated for 5 h in complete fresh
medium after which autophagy induction was measured.
At these conditions, the cells displayed a significant
increase in autophagic vacuoles staining (Figure 5A),

AMPK activation is needed for autophagy
induction by OLE

[26]. A more consistent later increase in Beclin-1
expression had been already observed in cells exposed for
24 h to OLE (Figure 1). We conclude that cell exposure to
OLE for a time as short as 10 min is sufficient to increase
free cytosolic Ca2+ coming from the ER which, in turn,
activates CaMKKβ with ensuing induction of AMPK
phosphorylation and activation of the autophagic flux.

Finally, we evaluated the correlation between
AMPK activation and autophagy induction by OLE using
compound C (CC), the only known AMPK inhibitor.
We expected no autophagy induction in the presence
of CC; however, we observed that autophagy was still

activated, though to a reduced extent, at these conditions.
To explain this effect, we checked whether CC induced
basic autophagy in control cells; actually, we observed
that CC is an autophagy activator per se (independently
of any effect on AMPK activity) in this cell line (Figure
6), as it was previously reported for other cancer cells [27,
28]. Nevertheless, CC, even though did not completely
abolish, significantly reduced OLE-autophagy activation,
suggesting a strong prevalence of the pathway proceeding
through AMPK even in this case. To confirm this
hypothesis, we used a different, CC-insensitive, cell line
chosen after testing a panel of different lines. We found
an useful model in the rat pancreatic insulinoma RIN-5F
cells, in which CC does not trigger autophagy. In these
cells, OLE-treatment activated autophagy similarly
to what observed in SH-SY5Y cells but this effect was
significantly counteracted by cell pretreatment with CC,
as shown both by autophagic vacuoles staining (Figure
7A) and by western blot analysis of LC-3 II (Figure 7B).

These results fully confirmed, in a different cell line, that
the activation of AMPK signaling plays a paramount role
in OLE-induced autophagy, supporting the hypothesis that
autophagy activation occurs mainly, if not exclusively,
through the path OLE - Ca2+ increase - CaMKKβ
activation - AMPK phosphorylation.

OLE inhibits mTOR via activation of AMPK in
the cortex of TgCRND8 mice
To confirm and extend in tissue the proposed
mechanism of autophagy activation by OLE in cultured
cells, we used TgCRND8 mice, an in vivo model, of
Aβ deposition which mimics some features of AD. We
previously reported that OLE supplementation for 8
weeks to daily food of TgCRND8 mice induces an intense
autophagic response and lysosomal activity in the cortex
of animals of different ages (23). On the basis of these

data, we explored the involvement of mTOR and AMPK
in OLE-triggered autophagy in the cortical tissue of 6/12
month-old TgCRND8 mice fed with OLE. As expected,
in the cortex of control, OLE-untreated, TgCRND8 mice
we found enhanced phospho-mTOR immunoreactivity
(Figure 8A) and increased levels of the phosphorylated
mTOR substrate p70 S6K (Figure 8B); however, these
modifications were markedly reduced in the cortex of
OLE-fed TgCRND8 mice, where no significant differences
with controls were detected. These data further support
the idea that autophagy activation by OLE proceeds
through mTOR inhibition. Next, we assessed whether
the latter matched AMPK activation; we found enhanced
levels of phospho-AMPK, and hence AMPK activation,

in the cortex of OLE-fed TgCRND8 mice as compared
to untreated animals (Figure 6C). Altogether, these data
indicate that in the cortex of OLE-fed TgCRND8 mice
the activation of autophagy likely occurs following AMPK
activation, and that the latter matches mTOR inhibition.
No age-related differences in both mTOR and AMPK
data were detected in 6 month-old and in 12 month-old
mice, thus the two age groups were pooled and reported
as 6/12 months. Taken together, these results confirm those
obtained with cultured cells and match those previously
reported with a different neuroblastoma cell line [23],
confirming that comparable molecular mechanisms of
OLE-autophagy activation are present both in cultured
cells and in tissue.

DISCUSSION

mice, OLE administration with the food results in reduction
of Aβ peptide production and neuroinflammation; more
remarkably, it induces other significant effects, restoring
LTP, reducing the number and compactness of the plaques,
activating the microglia and, most importantly, promoting
an intense autophagic response [21, 23]. However, nothing
was known at the molecular level about the mechanism
of the latter effect. In this study we tried to fill the gap
by investigating some molecular mechanisms underlying
autophagy activation by OLE both in vitro in neuronal
cells and in vivo in TgCRND8 mice. In the latter, the
activation of AMPK which, in turn, negatively modulates
mTOR, could underlie the previously reported OLEinduced intense autophagic and lysosomal response in the
brain cortex of OLE-fed mice [23].
Here, we found that OLE induces autophagy
in cultured neuroblastoma cells by a mechanism
substantially in accordance with those previously
reported for other polyphenols, confirming that in cells
treated with polyphenols the Ca2+/CaMKKβ/AMPK/
mTOR axis is actually at work. We found that the Ca2+
rise in OLE-treated cells was the result of Ca2+ exit from
the intracellular stores rather than of its entry from the
external medium. This implies that OLE penetrates inside
the cell though the plasmamembrane without damaging it.
We did not checked the presence of OLE inside the cells,
however, this would not be surprising, considering that
the molecule is hydrophobic. Moreover, such a possibility
is supported by a recent report where it has clearly been
shown that compounds from olive leaves, including OLE,
are found inside treated cells in a breast-cancer cell line
[34]. We have previously reported that a time-dependent
decrease of phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate p70
S6K occurs in N2a cells, a different neuroblastoma cell
line, treated with OLE at the same concentration used
in this study [23], confirming that autophagy activation
by OLE proceeds through AMPK activation and mTOR
inhibition. Of interest, in the same study, AMPK activation
was evident at 3-6 h of OLE treatment, a time similar to
that at which, in this study, we found the highest peak
of AMPK phosphorylation. Taken together, these data
support the hypothesis that autophagy activation by OLE
proceeds via the AMPK/mTOR signalling pathway. That
a panel of coherent, yet not completely matching, results
were found with different cultured cells does not weakens
the take-home message of this study; rather it strengthens
it, confirming that similar molecular mechanisms underlie
OLE-induced activation of autophagy in different cell
types as well as in mouse tissue.
The above considerations open intriguing
consequences. For example, it has been repeatedly
reported that some polyphenols, including OLE, are
able to induce epigenetic modifications, in terms of
histone acetylation and DNA methylation, particularly
in cancer cells [35] and that, in the brain of OLEfed TgCRND8 mice, modified expression levels of

A growing body of research has shown that
polyphenols of plant origin have beneficial properties
against ageing and a number of pathological
conditions spanning from cancer, cardiovascular and
neurodegenerative diseases, age-related metabolic
deterioration and diseases including type 2 diabetes and
the metabolic syndrome and neurodegenerative diseases.
The presence of plant polyphenols at substantial levels
in a number of foods that characterize the Mediterranean
and the Asian diets, has been recognized as a leading
explanation of the benefits for health of these alimentary
regimens [1, 29]. Plant polyphenols possess a number of
properties that can contribute to explain their effects on
health, the most recognized being their antioxidant, antiinflammatory and anti-aggregation power. However, these
properties, although of importance, cannot explain by
themselves the remarkable effects of these molecules that
appear not generic but, rather, very specific, even though
shared. In fact, they are able to impact on cell viability
by interfering with a number of basic processes including
transcriptional regulation through epigenetic effects and
autophagy [8, 21, 23].
Recent research has sought to decipher the
polyphenol-cell biology relations by investigating some
of these substances that are present in foods of large use
including red wine, green tea, extra virgin olive oil and
the turmeric. The data reported in recent years have shown
that specific polyphenols such as resveratrol, EGCG and
curcumin are able to elicit the autophagic response thus
improving such housekeeping tool that results in increased
cell longevity and favors the clearance of misfolded/
aggregated peptides and proteins in several human
amyloid diseases [8].
It is widely known that autophagy activation can
result from different pathways including the phosphoinositol-(IP3) signalling, the Ca2+-calpains-Gsα pathways
[30], in addition to the Ca2+ -CaMKKβ (LKB1)-AMPKmTOR pathway. The molecular basis of autophagy
activation by a number of polyphenols have been
investigated; they include the pivotal role of AMPK, a
heterotrimeric Ser/Thr kinase, that is activated by several
upstream kinases, including LKB1 and CaMKKβ, and,
in turn, negatively controls mTOR, a potent inhibitor
of autophagy [31-33]. CaMKKβ is activated by free
Ca2+, whose cytosolic levels appear important to initiate
the autophagy flux. Ca2+ increase seems to be the main
upstream biochemical modification induced by several
polyphenols as well as a primary cause that eventually
leads to the activation of autophagy. However, at present,
it cannot be concluded that this is a basic effect shared by
plant polyphenols known to be protective against ageing
and disease, nor whether different polyphenols trigger
different autophagy pathways.
Recently, we have shown that, in the TgCRND8

key proteins including glutaminyl cyclase, Beclin-1,
LC-3 II and histone deacetylase-2 were found [21]. In
such a scenario the transcriptor factor EB (TFEB), a
transcriptional regulator of lysosomal biogenesis that
controls the expression of central autophagy genes [4-6],
could perform an important role; in fact, it appears to be
inhibited upon phosphorylation by mTORC and activated
upon dephosphorylation by calcineurin, a phosphatase
that has recently been shown to be activated by lysosomal
Ca2+ [36]. Hence, autophagy appears to be regulated by
Ca2+ signals coming from different cell stores that affect
independently but, possibly, synergistically, the autophagic
flux. In this context, the Ca2+/CaMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR
axis could synergize with calcineurin maintaining TFEB in
a de-phosphorylated, and hence activated, form for longer
time periods. An aspect that merits further investigation.
Another aspect of potential interest is represented by
the positive control exerted by insulin and several growth
factors on mTORC that should result in reduced ability
to trigger autophagy and, possibly, reduced synergy to
the calcineurin effects. Impaired insulin sensitivity, with
increased insulin incretion, is a common phenomenon
in aged people that can affect autophagy efficiency [37,
38]. Accordingly, type 2 diabetes could find a right place
in such a scenario. Actually, it has recently been shown
that autophagy activation through positive control of
transcription of key autophagy genes is decreased under
conditions of insulin resistance [39].
In conclusion, our study provides evidence that
the mechanism of autophagy activation by polyphenols
resides on quite general effects of these substances
on cell regulatory mechanisms underlying the control
of autophagy. Our data add further knowledge to the
molecular basis of OLE-induced autophagy that confirms
and extends our previous studies carried out both in vivo
and with a different cell line. When added to the available
literature, our findings provide strong support to the idea
that plant polyphenols are indeed useful to treat ageing and
age-related diseases where autophagy dysfunction plays
an important role such as cancer, neurodegeneration and
type 2 diabetes thus reinforcing the theoretical basis for
their use to combat these conditions.

Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and rat RIN5F insulinoma cells were from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in
DMEM F-12/HAM (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany),
glutamine and antibiotics. RIN-5F cells were cultured
in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2.25
g/L glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 1.0 mM, sodium pyruvate,
glutamine and antibiotics. Both cell lines were maintained
in a 5.0% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C.

Analysis of autophagic vacuoles
The Cyto-ID® Autophagy Detection Kit (Enzo
Life Sciences) which uses a novel dye that selectively
labels autophagic vacuoles in living cells was used to
monitor autophagy induction by fluorescence microscopy,
according to the manufacturer instructions. The cells were
plated for 24 h in 24-well plates containing coverslips and
then treated with 50 μM OLE for different time periods.
In some experiments the cells were pre-treated for 30 min
with 13.3 µM STO-609 (a CaMKKβ inhibitor), 4.0 mM
EGTA (an impermeant Ca2+ chelator), 10 µM compound
C (CC, an AMPK inhibitor) or for 1.0 h with 40 μM
cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, an ER Ca2+-ATPase blocker
(all inhibitors were from Sigma-Aldrich), before OLE
administration. After incubation with OLE, the cells were
washed and incubated for further 4.0 h in complete fresh
medium. Then, the medium was removed and the cells
were washed twice with 100 μl of PBS and then with
100 μl of 1 × Assay-Buffer provided with Dectection
Kit containing 10% FCS. After washing, the cells were
incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 μl of Dual detection
reagent (prepared by diluting Cyto-ID Green Detection
Reagent 330 times in a mixture of 1× Assay Buffer plus
FCS), protected from light. Finally, the cells were washed
three times with the same solution (1 × Assay Buffer-FCS
10%) and the coverslips were placed on microscope slides.
The stained cells were analyzed by using a confocal Leica
TCS SP5 scanning microscope (Mannheim, Germany)
equipped with an argon laser source for fluorescence
measurements at 488 nm and a Leica Plan Apo 63 × oil
immersion objective. A series of optical sections (1024
× 1024 pixels) 1.0 μm in thickness was taken through
the cell depth for each examined sample. The confocal
microscope was set at optimal acquisition conditions, e.g.,
pinhole diameters, detector gain and laser powers. Settings
were maintained constant for each analysis. Phase-contrast
images were also acquired using the DIC channel. To
quantify the green fluorescent signal, 10-22 cells were
analyzed in each experiment using ImageJ software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Oleuropein deglycosylation
Oleuropein (Extrasynthase) deglycosylation was
performed as previously described [19]. Oleuropein
aglycone was dissolved to 100 mM in DMSO to obtain
a stock solution that was stored at -20 °C protected from
light. Dilutions in aqueous buffers were made immediately
before use.

Western blotting

Animal experiments

In parallel with autophagic vacuoles analysis, OLEtreated cells were analyzed by western blotting. To this
purpose, the cells were lysed directly in Laemmli buffer
(60 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10 mM EDTA,
10% (w/v) glycerol). Before immunoblotting, protein
concentration was determined with a BCA detection
kit (Pierce, USA) and adjusted to equal concentrations
across different samples. The samples were added with
β-mercaptoethanol and bromophenol blue, boiled for 10
min, clarified at 10000 × g for 10 min, run on 12% SDSPAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham
Bioscience, UK). After blocking with 5.0% (w/v) BSA
in 0.1% (v/v) PBS-Tween-20 or directly with methanol,
the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with
specific primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-beclin1
antibody (1:2000, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3II
A/B antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit monoclonal
anti-phospho-AMPKα (Thr172) and anti-AMPKα
antibodies (1:1000, Cell Signaling). Mouse monoclonal
anti-β−actin antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc.) was used for protein load normalization. The day
after, the blots were incubated for 1.0 h with specific
secondary antibodies (1:10000, goat anti-rabbit antibody
and goat anti-mouse antibody, Molecular Probes,
Life Technologies); the immunoreactive bands were
detected with the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent
HRP substrate (Millipore) or SuperSignal West Pico
chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and quantified by densitometric analysis using a
ChemiDoc system and the Quantity One software (BioRad Laboratories, Italy). Statistical analysis of the bands
was performed on results from at least three independent
experiments, using ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post-test.

Transgenic (Tg) hemizygous CRND8 mice
harboring a double-mutant gene of APP695 [40] and
wild type (wt) control littermates were used following the
ECC (DL 116/92, Directive 86/609/EEC) and National
guidelines for animal care. The protocol was approved by
the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the
Italian Ministry of Health (Permit Number: 283/2012-B).
Tg and wt mice of 4 and 10 months of age at the beginning
of treatment were used, n = 6 group/genotype, equally
divided for sex. The animals were treated for 8 weeks with
a modified low-fat (5.0%) AIN-76A diet (10 g/day per
mouse) supplemented with OLE (50 mg/kg of diet) (OLEfed mice) or not (untreated mice) as previously reported
[21, 23]. Tissue processing, immunohistochemistry and
western blotting were also as previously reported [21, 23].
In western blotting, 1:1000 rabbit anti-phospho-p70 S6
Kinase (Thr389), anti-phospho-AMPK (Thr172) and antiAMPK (Cell Signaling, MA, USA) antibodies were used;
anti-actin rabbit antibody (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) was
diluted 1:4000. In immunohistochemistry experiments, a
rabbit anti-phospho-mTOR (S2448) polyclonal antibody
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used at 1:100 dilution.

Measurement of intracellular Ca2+ levels

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA, plus Bonferroni’s post-hoc
test, was used to analyse Western blotting experiments.
Statistical analyses were carried out with GraphPad Prism
version 5.0 for Windows (San Diego, CA, USA) and the
statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Data are
reported as mean values ± standard error of the mean
(S.E.M).

None.

The cytosolic levels of free Ca2+ were measured by
using the Fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-3AM) probe
(Molecular Probes) whose fluorescence largely increases
in response to Ca2+ binding. Subconfluent SH-SY5Y cells
grown on glass coverslips were treated with 50 µM OLE
for different time periods. At the end of each treatment,
the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 30
min at 37 °C with 10 µM Fluo-3AM plus Pluronic F-127
(20% in DMSO) at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio (the final DMSO
concentration used to dissolve the probe was 0.04%).
Then the cells were washed again and fixed in 2.0 %
buffered paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Cell fluorescence
was analyzed by confocal microscopy, quantified and
statistically analyzed as described for autophagic vacuoles
analysis.
