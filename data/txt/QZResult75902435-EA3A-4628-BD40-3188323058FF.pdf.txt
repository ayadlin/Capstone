Abstract
Understanding the pathogenesis of leukemia in the context of
lymphopoiesis may reveal novel therapeutic targets. Previously, we have shown that mTOR inhibitors (MTI) show activity
in vitro and in preclinical models of both human and murine
precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL),
inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. These
MTI-mediated effects can be reversed by interleukin-7 (IL-7),
an important regulator of early B-cell development. This
observation led us to examine the contribution of signaling via
the IL-7RA chain, which is shared by the receptor complexes
of IL-7 and thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin (TSLP).
TSLP is closely related to IL-7 and active in lymphopoiesis,
but an effect of TSLP on leukemia cells has not been described.
We examined the effect of TSLP on pre-B ALL cells and their
response to MTIs. Here, we show that TSLP stimulates
proliferation of pre-B ALL cell lines. TSLP also partially
reverses the effects of MTI on proliferation, apoptosis, and
ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in cell
lines, with similar biological effects seen in some primary
human lymphoblast samples. These data show that TSLP can
promote survival of pre-B ALL cells and antagonize the effects
of MTIs. These findings suggest that IL-7RA chain is
responsible for transducing the survival signal that overcomes
MTI-mediated growth inhibition in pre-B ALL. Thus, further
exploration of the IL-7RA pathway may identify potential
therapeutic targets in the treatment of ALL. Our data illustrate
that growth-factor–mediated signaling may provide one
mechanism of MTI resistance. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9963–70]

Introduction
Signal transduction inhibitors have provided important recent
advances in cancer treatment. One such class of signal
transduction inhibitors is the mTOR inhibitors (MTI), which
include rapamycin and its derivatives. Although rapamycin is
Food and Drug Administration approved as an immunosuppressive agent (1, 2), recent development of MTIs has focused on their
use as anticancer signal transduction inhibitors (3). mTOR, which
is a serine/threonine kinase, acts as a central regulator of cell
growth and division, inducing cell cycle progression, capdependent translation, and ribosome synthesis (4, 5). It functions

as a sensor to ensure that the cell is in an appropriate nutritional
and energetic state before committing to cell growth and
proliferation. Dysregulation and constitutive activation of the
AKT/mTOR pathway leading to cell proliferation and survival
have been shown in many different cancers (6). MTIs inhibit the
growth of and/or induce apoptosis in many tumor types including
lymphoid malignancies (7, 8). Previously, we have reported that
MTIs induce growth inhibition and apoptosis of early B-cell
progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) cells;
furthermore, these MTI-mediated inhibitory effects are reversed
by the cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7) (9, 10). Thus, we wanted to
investigate further the mechanism by which signaling via the IL-7
receptor rescues rapamycin-treated pre-B ALL cells from growth
inhibition to gain insight into the pathogenesis of ALL and its
response to MTIs.
Cytokines, including IL-7 and thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin (TSLP), are important regulators of normal lymphoid
development and, therefore, may influence proliferation and/or
survival of ALL cells (11–13). IL-7 and TSLP are closely related, yet
distinct, in biological function. IL-7 is absolutely required for normal
murine B- and T-cell development (14). IL-7 promotes the proliferation of pro–B cells, as well as developmental progression
through the early B-cell stages (15, 16). Although IL-7 is absolutely
required only for T-cell development in humans, it still plays an
important role in human B-cell development, providing a survival
signal for B lymphoid precursors (17, 18). In contrast to IL-7,
information regarding TSLP and its function is limited. TSLP also
supports early B-cell proliferation and development, but differentially affects murine B-cell progenitors of fetal and adult origin,
acting earlier in the development of fetal-derived murine B cells
(19–23).
The receptors and subsequent signaling pathways mediated by
IL-7 and TSLP are also closely related: IL-7R and TSLPR are both
heterodimeric complexes composed of two subunits, each
including IL-7Ra chain and a partner subunit. In IL-7R, the
partner subunit is the gamma common (gc) chain, (24) whereas in
TSLPR, the partner is the TSLPR chain (25, 26). IL-7Ra has a much
more restricted expression pattern than either gc or TSLPR (27).
IL-7Ra is expressed from the early pro-B through the early pre-B
stage of B-cell development and may be a marker for the common
lymphoid progenitor (11, 28). Signal transduction through both
IL-7R and TSLPR complexes ultimately results in the activation of
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 and
subsequent cell proliferation, but does so through different
pathway intermediates: IL-7 signals through the Janus-activated
kinase 1/3 (JAK1/3) kinases, whereas the TSLP-mediated signaling
intermediates before STAT5 activation have not been fully
elucidated (29–31).

Cancer Research

Although the role of IL-7 in normal lymphopoiesis has been
extensively studied, the contribution of IL-7–mediated signaling in
the development or progression of pre-B ALL has not been fully
elucidated. However, there is evidence that IL-7 promotes survival
of human T and B ALL cells, and that IL-7 has been associated
with certain lymphoid malignancies (9, 32–34). Scupoli et al., found
that IL-7 secreted by thymic epithelial cells protected T ALL cells
from undergoing spontaneous apoptosis, and that this antiapoptotic effect was blocked by an anti-IL7Ra chain-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb; ref. 35). In contrast, a role of TSLP contributing
to leukemogenesis has not been reported previously. Based on the
similarities between IL-7 and TSLP, we hypothesized that TSLP
would promote proliferation of pre-B ALL cells as well as rescue
these cells from MTI-induced growth inhibition and cell death.
Here, we report that TSLP acts very similarly to IL-7, stimulating
proliferation of pre-B ALL cells and blocking the inhibitory effects
induced by rapamycin, but with less potency. Because of the
shared structure of IL-7R and TSLPR, these data suggest that
signaling via the IL-7Ra chain may be responsible for transducing
the signal that ultimately protects ALL cells from MTI-induced
inhibitory effects.

Materials and Methods
Cells and culturing conditions. EA-RET transgenic mice have been
previously described, and cell lines established from leukemic EA-RET
transgenic mice were used in these studies (36). Immunophenotypically,
these leukemia cell lines originate from either the pro-B (cytoplasmic A )
or pre-B (cytoplasmic A+) stage of B-cell development. These murine ALL
cells were maintained at 37jC with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine,
10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 100 Amol/L nonessential
amino acids, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin (GibCo-BRL),
50 Amol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (Fisher Scientific), 10% FCS + 10% calf serum
(HyClone; C20 media) with 2 ng/mL IL-7. Cell surface markers on these cells
were determined by flow cytometry as described previously (36), and the
phenotype was stable in culture over time (data not shown).
Cytokines and proliferation assays. Cells were cultured in IL-7–free
C20 media for 24 h. For in vitro culture studies, 1 to 2  104 cells per well
were cultured in triplicate in flat-bottomed 96-well plates with 0 to 100
ng/mL rapamycin (Calbiochem), 0 to 6 ng/mL recombinant mouse IL-7
(Leinco Technologies, Inc.), 0 to 30 ng/mL recombinant mouse TSLP (R&D
Systems, Inc.), and 0 to 30 Ag/mL a-IL-7Ra chain mAb (clone A7R34;
eBioscience) for 3 to 5 days. Cell growth was assayed using 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; SigmaAldrich Co.) as previously described (37). Absorbance was measured at
570 nm using a BenchmarkPlus microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). Results are expressed as mean of absolute absorbance
number of treated sample divided by the mean of absolute absorbance
number of the control sample. Results >1 indicates proliferation, whereas
results <1 indicates growth inhibition.
Apoptosis assay. We plated 0.5 to 1  106 cells/mL in C20 media with
1 or 100 ng/mL rapamycin for 60 h. TSLP (30 ng/mL) was added to these
cultures with a delay of 0 to 36 h after incubation with rapamycin. To detect
apoptotic cells, levels of exposed phosphatidylserine on viable cells were
measured using the ApoAlert Annexin V detection kit (BD BiosciencesClontech) as previously described (38). Cells were incubated with FITCconjugated Annexin V and 7-AAD (BD Biosciences-PharMingen) and
analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur cytometer (Becton
Dickinson Biosciences).
Cell lysates and immunoblotting. A total of 107 cells were incubated in
C20 media with combinations of IL-7 (2 ng/mL), TSLP (30 ng/mL) and
rapamycin (1 or 100 ng/mL) for 1, 2, or 6 h. After incubation, cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS, and cell lysates were prepared as previously
described (9, 10). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 100 AL ice-cold lysis
buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies) containing Complete Mini (Roche

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

Applied Biosciences) and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (SigmaAldrich) and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. Forty Ag of protein were
loaded per lane and separated by electrophoresis on NuPage 10% or 4% to
12% gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Invitrogen). Proteins were labeled with antibodies to the ribosomal protein
S6, phosphorylated S6 [P-S6 (Ser235/236)], 4E-BP1 total protein, phosphorylated 4E-BP1 [P-4E-BP1 (Thr70); (Cell Signaling Technologies)], STAT5 and
phosphorylated STAT5 (P-STAT5; Tyr694; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)
and then detected by chemiluminescence (Cell Signaling Technologies).
Densitometric analysis was done using UnScanIt software (Silk Scientifics)
to determine fold changes of phosphorylated proteins from treated relative
to untreated lysates after normalization to corresponding total proteins.
Analysis of human primary ALL lymphoblasts using short-term
bone marrow stromal layer culture system. Primary human lymphoblasts (obtained from the Leukemia Cell Bank, University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, PA) were cultured on fresh human bone marrow stromal cell
layers (provided by Dr. John Choi, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia,
PA) as previously described (10, 39, 40). After 20-Gy irradiation, human
primary bone marrow stromal cells that were isolated from CD19-depleted
normal donor bone marrow cells (105 per well) were seeded onto 24-well
plates and cultured in C10 media (RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine, 10 mmol/L
HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 100 Amol/L nonessential amino acids,
100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, 50 Amol/L 2-mercaptoethanol + 10% FCS). After incubation overnight, cells were washed with
serum-free X-vivo 10 media (Cambrex). For 48 h, primary human
lymphoblasts (105 per well) were cultured with the stromal cells in X-vivo
10 media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, SCF (20 mg/mL),
insulin-like growth factor-I (20 ng/mL), and FLT-3 (10 ng/mL; R&D Systems,
Inc.) containing rapamycin and TSLP (39). Viability was measured by
visualization of cell cultures, enumeration of live cells by trypan blue
exclusion, and flow cytometry for FSC/SSC and Annexin V/7-AAD positivity
(BD Biosciences-PharMingen).
Statistics. Proliferation and apoptosis assays were analyzed by ANOVA
with Dunnett’s or Tukey’s LSD comparison and the paired Student’s t test
using Analyse-It Software for Microsoft Excel, v. 1.73. A P value of <0.05 was
considered significant.

Results
TSLP stimulates proliferation of ALL cell lines and the
phosphorylation of STAT5. Because TSLP is a cytokine active in
B-cell lymphopoiesis, we hypothesized that TSLP acts as a growth
factor for pre-B ALL cells, supporting the importance of signaling
via the IL-7Ra chain. If signaling via the gc chain of the IL-7R were
vital to transmitting this survival response, then we would predict
that IL-7 would have effects not seen with TSLP, whereas if
signaling via the IL7-Ra were key in producing this response, then
both cytokines would have similar effects. To evaluate the effects of
TSLP on pre-B ALL, we used the murine early progenitor B (pre-B
ALL) cell lines, T309, 289, 420.2, and 781, derived from EA-ret
transgenic mice (9). These cell lines were cultured with increasing
concentrations of TSLP (0–30 ng/mL). We chose this range
because TSLP stimulates BA/F3 cells transfected with IL-7Ra chain
within this range of TSLP concentration (26). After 4 days, cell
proliferation was assessed using MTT. Figure 1A shows a dosedependent proliferation in response to TSLP, which is similar to
that seen with IL-7 (9). These pre-B ALL cell lines all showed a
significant (P < 0.0001) proliferative response to TSLP, ranging
from 1.5 (cell line 289) to almost 3 increase (cell line T309) in
proliferation. Proliferation seemed to plateau at a concentration of
3 ng/mL TSLP for the previously identified IL-7–independent cell
lines (289 and 420.2), but not the dependent cell lines (T309
and 781). In comparison, IL-7–stimulated proliferation plateaued
at f2 ng/mL (data not shown and ref. 9). Overall, response of each
cell line to TSLP paralleled the response to IL-7 in that TSLP could

Effect of TSLP on Pre-B ALL

Figure 1. TSLP stimulates proliferation and STAT5 phosphorylation of ALL
cell lines. A, TSLP induces cell proliferation. EA-ret transgenic mouse-derived
pre-B ALL cell lines T309, 781, 289, and 420.2 were cultured with TSLP
(0–30 ng/mL). Cells were incubated for 4 d, and then cell proliferation was
assessed using MTT. All measurements were done in triplicate. Columns, mean
of the treated/control (untreated) cells (relative absorbance of triplicate cultures,
as described in Materials and Methods); bars, SE. Results from one of three
independent experiments that were done on all four cell lines are presented here.
Difference in proliferation as compared with untreated cultures was significant
at TSLP doses z0.3 ng/mL for cell line 781 and z1 ng/mL for cell lines T309,
289, and 420.2 [one-way between subjects (BS) ANOVA with Dunnett’s LSD
comparison, P < 0.0001]. B, treatment with TSLP increases phosphorylation
of STAT5 over time. After 24 h incubation in IL-7– and TSLP-free media, line 289
cells were cultured with IL-7 (2 ng/mL) or TSLP (30 ng/mL) for 0, 1, and 4 h.
Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for phosphorylated and total
STAT5 proteins (P-STAT5 and Total-STAT5, respectively). Each lane was
loaded with equal amounts of protein. Results from one of two independent
experiments are presented here.

replace IL-7 for all tested IL-7–dependent cell lines, as well as
increase the proliferation of the IL-7–independent, IL-7–responsive
cell lines. Coculture with both IL-7 and TSLP did not produce an
additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effect (data not shown). These
data show that both TSLP and IL-7 stimulate cell proliferation
of ALL cells, supporting a role for IL-7Ra signaling in pre-B ALL.
Because activation of TSLP- and IL-7–mediated signal transduction pathways leads to the activation of the transcription factor
STAT5 (41, 42) and because constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT
pathway has been associated with a subset of hematologic
malignancies (reviewed in ref. 43), we evaluated the phosphorylation status of STAT5 following stimulation with TSLP and IL-7 in
pre-B ALL cells. After line 289 cells were stimulated with IL-7 or
TSLP for 0 to 4 h, P-STAT5 along with total STAT5 proteins
were detected via immunoblotting. Doses of IL-7 and TSLP (2 and
30 ng/mL, respectively) that produced maximal proliferative effect

www.aacrjournals.org

in culture were used. Although untreated cells had virtually no
P-STAT5 detected, cells stimulated with either IL-7 or TSLP yielded
increased phosphorylation of STAT5 over time (Fig. 1B). Although
treatment with both cytokines resulted in STAT5 phosphorylation,
they did so with different timing. Treatment with IL-7 for
1 h resulted in a substantial degree of STAT5 phosphorylation,
but by 4 h, the level of P-STAT5 was back to baseline. In
comparison, treatment with TSLP for 1 h increased the amount of
P-STAT5 detected as compared with 0 h, but to a lesser extent as
that observed with IL-7. However, there was still evidence of STAT5
activation after 4 h of treatment with TSLP. Although changes in
P-STAT5 were observed, there was no significant change in total
STAT5 proteins detected over time.
TSLP prevents growth inhibition and apoptosis in rapamycin-treated ALL cells. Given the similar proliferative responses,
we evaluated the effect of TSLP on rapamycin-treated pre-B
ALL cells. We found that TSLP was capable of rescuing murine
pre-B ALL cell lines from rapamycin-induced growth inhibition
(Fig. 2A). Although it did not rescue pre-B ALL cells from
rapamycin-induced growth inhibition to the same extent as IL-7,
TSLP had a significant effect (P < 0.001) on proliferation for each
dose of rapamycin. TSLP (3–30 ng/mL) almost completely restored
cell proliferation inhibited by low-dose rapamycin (1 ng/mL) from
50% up to 85–90% of baseline, untreated cell growth. At higher
doses of rapamycin (10–100 ng/mL), TSLP only partially restored
cell proliferation from 20% to only 50–60% of baseline, a difference
that was still statistically significant (P = 0.003). In comparison, IL-7
almost completely reversed cells from rapamycin-induced growth
inhibition even at high doses of rapamycin (100 ng/mL). Again,
treatment with IL-7 and TSLP concurrently did not have an
additive effect on rescuing rapamycin-treated ALL cells (data not
shown).
It was important to show that the reversal of MTI-induced
growth inhibition was due to the prevention of apoptosis and cell
death by the cytokines rather than an outgrowth of a subpopulation of MTI-resistant, cytokine-responsive cells. To test this, we
treated pre-B ALL cells with rapamycin (1 and 100 ng/mL) and
then added 30 ng/mL TSLP from 0 to 48 h later. After 60 h (total in
culture), the extent of apoptosis and cell death was determined
using staining for Annexin V (to detect apoptotic cells) and 7-AAD
(to detect nonviable cells). Rapamycin induced apoptosis and cell
death in a dose-dependent manner, with significantly more (by
f2.5-fold) apoptotic and dead cells seen at the high dose versus
low dose of rapamycin (Fig. 2B and C). TSLP impacted the cell
viability of these rapamycin-treated pre-B ALL cells in a timedependent manner. TSLP almost completely prevented apoptosis
in culture conditions in which cells were concomitantly exposed to
TSLP and either dose of rapamycin. A delay of 12 and 24 h in
adding TSLP also resulted in a significant (P = 0.002) reversal of
rapamycin-induced apoptosis. However, a delay of TSLP addition
beyond 24 h impaired the ability of TSLP to prevent apoptosis, with
TSLP having very little effect on apoptosis after 36 to 48 h of
rapamycin exposure. Similar results were seen with delayed
administration of IL-7 (data not shown). These results indicate
that both TSLP and IL-7 block rapamycin-induced apoptosis and
cell death within ALL cells as opposed to promoting rapamycinresistant cell proliferation.
IL-7 and TSLP induce phosphorylation of the mTOR
pathway intermediates S6 and 4E-BP1, an effect antagonized
by rapamycin. To further evaluate the mechanism by which TSLPmediated signaling interacts with the mTOR pathway, we used

immunoblotting of ALL cell lysates to detect post-translational
modifications of ribosomal S6 and 4E-BP1, two mTOR pathway
intermediates. After treatment with combinations of IL-7, TSLP,
and rapamycin for 60 and 120 min, phosphorylated S6 (P-S6)
(Ser235/236) and total S6 proteins were detected. Over time,
treatment with either IL-7 or TSLP increased S6 phosphorylation
(Fig. 3A). As compared with untreated cultures, IL-7 induced a 3and 4-fold increase in S6 phosphorylation after 60 and 120 min of
incubation, respectively. TSLP treatment also resulted in S6
phosphorylation but was more delayed: at 60 min, treatment with
TSLP resulted in only a modest 20% increase, but by 120 min, TSLP
and IL-7 induced a comparable degree of S6 phosphorylation. In
contrast, treatment with both low- and high-dose rapamycin
resulted in profound hypophosphorylation of S6. Addition of either
IL-7 or TSLP partially restored the phosphorylation of S6 in the
presence of rapamycin in a dose-dependent manner.
Another downstream target of mTOR, 4E-BP1, was evaluated
after 6 h of treatment with combinations of TSLP, IL-7, and
rapamycin. Detection of P-4E-BP1 yielded similar results as

Effect of TSLP on Pre-B ALL

IL-7 or TSLP resulted in a 30% to 50% increase in P-4E-BP1 as
compared with untreated cultures (Fig. 3B). Treatment with 1 and
100 ng/mL rapamycin caused profound hypophosphorylation of
4E-BP-1, with a 3- and almost 5-fold decrease in band intensity,
respectively. IL-7 and TSLP restored phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in
rapamycin-treated cells. Again, the reversal seen with IL-7 was
more complete than that observed with TSLP. Taken together,
these results show that signaling mediated by TSLP and IL-7
interferes with the inhibitory actions of MTIs in ALL cells.
The antagonistic anti–IL-7RA chain mAb A7R34 inhibits cell
proliferation of IL-7– and TSLP-responsive ALL lines and
blocks the ability of IL-7 and TSLP to reverse mTOR inhibition.
To further study the role of IL-7Ra chain signaling in pre-B ALL, we
used an antagonistic anti–IL-7Ra mAb (A7R34; ref. 28, 35). We
evaluated the effects of this a-IL-7Ra mAb on both cytokinedependent (T309) and -independent (289) cell lines. Cells were
cultured with combinations of IL-7, TSLP, rapamycin, and 0 to
30 Ag/mL a-IL-7Ra mAb. After 3 days incubation, cell proliferation
was assessed using MTT. In the absence of IL-7 or TSLP in the
culture media, incubation with the antibody alone showed no
significant effect on cell proliferation (P = 0.15). Addition of TSLP
at 3 and 30 ng/mL significantly increased proliferation, consistent
with the results above (P = 0.0002; see Fig. 4A). This proliferative
effect was inhibited substantially, but not completely, by the
addition of a-IL-7Ra mAb (P = 0.014). Similarly, IL-7 at 0.2 and
2 ng/mL increased proliferation as compared with untreated cells
(P = 0.002; Fig. 4B). However, we observed that IL-7–induced
proliferation was completely inhibited by z1 Ag/mL a-IL-7Ra
mAb, with no statistically significant difference in proliferation
between cells treated with IL-7 + a-IL-7Ra mAb as compared with
a-IL-7Ra mAb alone (P = 0.89).
As seen in Fig. 4C, 100 ng/mL rapamycin significantly inhibited
(P < 0.0001) cell proliferation; addition of a-IL-7Ra mAb had no
further significant effect (P = 0.52). Again, IL-7 completely and
TSLP partially reversed rapamycin-induced inhibition. Here, the
presence of a-IL-7Ra mAb significantly antagonized the rescue of
rapamycin-treated cells by either IL-7 or TSLP (P = 0.0007 and
P = 0.001, respectively). The effect of a-IL-7Ra mAb was more
extensive on IL-7- than TSLP-treated cells. With doses z1 Ag/mL of
a-IL-7Ra mAb, there was complete blockade of the ability of IL-7 to
reverse rapamycin, with a lesser but still statistically significant
(P = 0.001) antagonism seen in the TSLP + rapamycin cultures.
This modest antagonism of TSLP by a-IL-7Ra mAb may reflect
the ability of TSLP to only partially rescue cells from rapamycininduced inhibition. Although IL-7 was more sensitive than TSLP,
the ability of both cytokines to induce proliferation and reverse
rapamycin-induced inhibition could be antagonized by specifically
blocking the actions of the IL-7Ra chain.
Biological effects of TSLP on primary human ALL lymphoblasts. To evaluate the effect of TSLP on primary human
lymphoblasts, we examined cell viability by cell enumeration and
morphologic assessment. In addition, the extent of apoptosis and
cell death was determined by Annexin V and 7-AAD staining, as
above. Primary lymphoblasts were obtained from four different
patients with pre-B ALL. Their demographics, immunophenotypes,
and cytogenetics are summarized in Table 1. A total of 1  105
primary human ALL cells per well were cultured on normal bone
marrow stromal layers and exposed to low-dose rapamycin
(1 ng/mL) and TSLP (30 ng/mL). Cells treated with rapamycin
alone had a 24-fold decrease in viable cells as compared with
control wells, from 1.2 to 0.05  106 cells. In contrast, TSLP-treated

Points, mean of the treated/control (untreated) cells; bars, SE. Results of one
of three independent experiments are presented here. There was no statistical
difference in proliferation with increasing concentrations of a-IL-7Ra mAb.
A, cells were cultured with combinations of 3 or 30 ng/mL TSLP and increasing
concentrations of a-IL-7Ra mAb. TSLP caused significant differences in
increased proliferation, with a 1.3- to 1.5-fold increase above baseline, untreated
cultures (one-way BS ANOVA with Dunnett’s LSD comparison, P = 0.0002);
the presence of increasing concentrations of a-IL-7Ra mAb led to a significant
reduction in TSLP-induced proliferation by 1.5- to 1.6-fold (two-way BS ANOVA,
P = 0.014). B, cells were cultured with combinations of 0.2 or 2 ng/mL IL-7
and increasing concentrations of a-IL-7Ra mAb. IL-7 alone caused significant
differences in increased proliferation by 1.3- to 1.5-fold (one-way BS ANOVA
with Dunnett’s LSD comparison, P = 0.002); and the presence of increasing
concentrations of a-IL-7Ra mAb caused a significant reduction in IL-7–induced
proliferation (two-way BS ANOVA, P = 0.007). C, cells were cultured with
combinations of 2 ng/mL IL-7, 30 ng/mL TSLP, 100 ng/mL rapamycin, and
increasing concentrations of a-IL-7Ra mAb. Rapamycin alone decreased
proliferation significantly (two-way BS ANOVA, P < 0.0001); addition of
a-IL-7Ra mAb to rapamycin-treated cells produced no significant difference in
proliferation (two-way BS ANOVA, P = 0.52), but it induced a statistically
significant reduction in IL-7 rescue (two-way BS ANOVA, P = 0.0007) and in
TSLP rescue (one-way BS ANOVA with Tukey’s LSD comparison, P = 0.001).

cells showed an increase in cell density with complete confluence
and areas of overgrowth as compared with untreated cells and
a viable cell count of 1.9  106 cells per well. Furthermore,
the addition of TSLP rescued the cells from rapamycin-induced
cell death, resulting in 1.1  106 viable cells per well, which is
comparable to the viability of untreated cells. The morphology of
the cells exposed to both TSLP and rapamycin was similar to that
of the untreated and TSLP-treated cells, but grew at a lower
density. As seen in Fig. 5, although only 19% of untreated cells were
undergoing apoptosis and cell death, 80% of rapamycin-treated
cells were nonviable. Cells cocultured with rapamycin and TSLP
after 48 h yielded only 25% nonviable cells, with 30% of cells
treated with TSLP alone undergoing apoptosis and cell death. We
observed that the lymphoblasts within these sample wells were

found to be densely populated and potentially overgrown in
response to TSLP, possibly accounting for the higher-thanexpected rate of cell death in cell cultures treated with TSLP
alone as compared with the background level of cell death in
untreated cell cultures. Similar results yielding comparable
changes in the percentage of viable versus nonviable cells after
treatment with combinations of rapamycin, TSLP, and IL-7 were
found in two (patient samples 96 and 195) out of four primary
human samples tested (data not shown).

Discussion
Great strides have been made in the treatment of ALL in children
over the past several decades, but for adult or high-risk patients

Effect of TSLP on Pre-B ALL

and for those who relapse, current treatment is usually unsuccessful. These patients have a poor prognosis despite aggressive
multimodality therapies and may benefit from biologically targeted
agents. Our investigations have focused on the effect of the MTI
rapamycin, on pre-B ALL cells and its effect in response to
cytokines that mediate survival signals during normal B-cell
development. Previously, we have shown that rapamycin inhibits
proliferation and induces apoptosis of pre-B ALL, effects which are
reversed by IL-7 (9, 10). In addition, rapamycin as a single agent
shows efficacy in mouse models of pre-B ALL (9, 10). Here, we
report the response of pre-B ALL cells to TSLP, another important
lymphopoietic cytokine. Specifically, we show that TSLP stimulates
the proliferation of pre-B ALL cell lines and some primary human
lymphoblasts in vitro, and that TSLP is capable of rescuing ALL
cells from rapamycin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis.
Even with delayed administration, TSLP and IL-7 retain the
capacity to suppress rapamycin-induced apoptosis for a period of
up to 24 h, although not later. The most likely explanation for these
results is that although MTI treatment eventually leads to
triggering an irreversible pathway of apoptosis and cell death,
commitment to apoptosis is not an early event, and survival
pathways driven by these cytokines can initially overcome the
effects of mTOR inhibition. The ability of these cytokines to induce
STAT5 phosphorylation as well as prevent rapamycin-induced
down-regulation of two downstream targets of mTOR, (S6 and
4E-BP1) supports this notion as well. These results implicate the
mTOR pathway as a downstream mediator of TSLP and IL-7
signaling. In addition, we found that the mAb A7R34, which
specifically blocks the actions of IL-7Ra chain, antagonizes the
proliferative actions of both IL-7 and TSLP. Because IL-7R and
TSLPR share the IL-7a chain, but not the gc chain, our results
support the hypothesis that IL-7Ra signaling is a major contributor
to the ability of these cytokines to antagonize the effects of
rapamycin.
Although TSLP rescued pre-B ALL cells from growth inhibition
and apoptosis induced by low-dose rapamycin (1 ng/mL), it only
partially reversed this inhibition at higher doses of rapamycin. In
comparison, IL-7 reversed pre-B ALL cell proliferation almost
completely even in cells treated with high-dose rapamycin.
Although blocking of the IL-7Ra chain in IL-7– and TSLP-treated
cells antagonized the proliferative effects of these cytokines,
this blockade was more effective in the case of IL-7 than TSLP.
IL-7–mediated signaling quickly resulted in STAT5 phosphorylation, while TSLP also induced STAT5 phosphorylation, albeit
with somewhat slower kinetics. We found similar results in the
differential timing of S6 phosphorylation induced by IL-7 as
compared with TSLP. In addition, as compared with TSLP,
IL-7 was more effective at maintaining the phosphorylation of
4E-BP1 in the presence of rapamycin. These findings are
consistent with the findings of Levin et al. (21), who studied
the effect of TSLP on the pre-B cell line NAG 8/7. They found
that NAG 8/7 cells respond more potently to IL-7 than to TSLP,
and that both TSLP- and IL-7–driven proliferation is blocked
only by the addition of anti–IL-7Ra chain-specific antibodies.
Thus, in both systems, IL-7 seems to act as a more potent
inducer of proliferation despite the common signaling events
activated by both cytokines. These data suggest that, although
IL-7Ra signaling is sufficient to produce the growth effects and
impact on MTI response we observed in ALL, other components
of the signaling complexes may potentiate or modulate this
response.

www.aacrjournals.org

Although the actions of IL-7 and TSLP are tightly integrated,
their activities affect lymphopoiesis differently (44). The relationship between TSLP and IL-7 and their contribution to leukemic
cell signaling may stem from differences in their receptor complexes. Transgenic mice that lack expression of IL-7Ra chain gene
(IL-7R / ) result in a more severe defect in B-cell development as
compared with mice that do not express the IL-7 gene (IL-7 / )
because the loss of IL-7Ra chain signaling abrogates both IL-7–
and TSLP-mediated signaling (45, 46). In contrast, mice lacking
TSLPR subunit gene expression (TSLPR / ) seem to have a normally developed B-cell compartment in their bone marrow (47).
The presence of the IL-7Ra chain significantly increases the binding affinity of TSLP to the TSLPR subunit alone, and cells coexpressing TSLPR, IL-7Ra, and gc chains proliferate to a greater
extent in response to IL-7 as compared with TSLP (26). These data
suggest that response to these cytokines may reflect the stoichiometry of the TSLPR and IL-7Ra subunits.
Mice that overexpress IL-7 (IL-7+/+) have increased numbers of B
and T cells and develop lymphomas (48), which do not occur in an
IL-7Ra / background. A similar effect can be seen with
alterations in STAT5 signaling, in that mitigation of STAT5
signaling leads to the prevention or delay in lymphomagenesis in
IL-7+/+ mice (49). These results support the notion that signal
strength induced by IL-7 and TSLP and composition of the
receptors transmitting this signal influence the survival of
malignant cells and may account for the differences we observed
in cell proliferation, survival, and response to MTI. The pairing of
IL-7Ra with either the gc chain or TSLPR may also activate
differentially other survival pathways within our murine pre-B ALL
cells, resulting in the apparent difference in potency of the IL-7
versus the TSLP response to mTOR inhibition and blockade of the
IL-7Ra chain in pre-B ALL cells.
In summary, we have shown an effect of the cytokine TSLP on
pre-B ALL cells. This is the first report that we are aware of
showing the proliferative effects of TSLP on pre-B ALL, including
some, but not all, human primary pre-B lymphoblasts tested. TSLP
can also rescue MTI-treated pre-B ALL cells from growth inhibition
and apoptosis. Because of the similarities shared by the TSLPR and
IL-7R signal transduction pathways, our data suggest that an
essential component of the survival signal in these ALL cells is
mediated by the IL-7Ra chain. Further investigation is needed to
fully elucidate the interactions of the mTOR and IL-7–/TSLPmediated signaling pathways in ALL cells. Inactivating antibodies
of IL-7 and TSLP that are currently in clinical development may
now have another use in the treatment of leukemia and need to be
studied in this context. Investigations using these antibodies along
with JAK inhibitors are under way. This work has the potential to
identify novel therapeutic targets for inhibition, in combination
with MTIs for the treatment of ALL, and point to growth factor–
mediated signaling as one mechanism of MTI resistance.
