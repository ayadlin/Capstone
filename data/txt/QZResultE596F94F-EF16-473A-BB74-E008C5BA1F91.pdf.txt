In vivo Antitumor Activity of a Recombinant IL-7/HGFb
Hybrid Cytokine in Mice
Laijun Lai1,2, Jingjun Jin1, and Irving Goldschneider1

Abstract
The immune cytokine interleukin (IL)-7 and the b-chain of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) aggregate to form
a naturally occurring heterodimer that stimulates the growth of common lymphoid progenitors and immature B
and T lymphoid cells. We have cloned and expressed the heterodimer as a single-chain hybrid cytokine
[recombinant (r) IL-7/HGFb], which stimulates short-term hematopoietic stem cells as well as lymphoid
precursors. Inasmuch as IL-7 and HGF are known to have antitumor and protumor activities, respectively, we
determined here whether either of these activities is exhibited by rIL-7/HGFb. We show that the in vivo
administration of rIL-7/HGFb markedly inhibits the growth of newly initiated and established tumors and the
formation of pulmonary metastases in murine models of colon cancer and melanoma. The antitumor effect of
rIL-7/HGFb correlated with a marked increase in the number of tumor-infiltrating CD4þ and CD8þ T cells and
activated dendritic cells. A major role for these immune cells in tumor suppression was indicated by the inability
of rIL-7/HGFb to inhibit the growth of tumor cells in vitro and in congenitally athymic mice. Analysis of
interferon-g–secreting T cells showed that the immune response was tumor specific. Our findings justify further
evaluation of rIL-7/HGFb as a novel experimental cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 71(1); 61–7. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
We previously purified a novel hybrid cytokine consisting of
interleukin (IL)-7 and HGFb from mouse bone marrow (BM)
stromal cells in a unique long-term BM culture system that
selectively generated TdTþ B-lineage precursors (1–3). We
have cloned and constructed the IL-7/HGFb gene, in which IL7 and HGFb cDNAs were connected by a flexible linker. We
have expressed the gene to produce a single-chain rIL-7/HGFb
protein that stimulates the growth of day 12 spleen colonyforming units, common lymphoid progenitors, early B-lineage
cells, and thymocytes in vitro (4). The rIL-7/HGFb cross-links
and induces juxtacrine interactions between the IL-7 and
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; c-Met) receptors on the cell
surface. This, in turn, results in signal "cross talk," the appearance of novel phosphorylated proteins downstream, and
functional readouts that are not induced by noncomplexed
rIL-7 and/or HGFb (ref. 4; data not shown).
IL-7 is essential for the development, maintenance, and
regeneration of B and T cells and is also an activation factor
for monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), and natural

heterodimer consisting of a 60-kDa a-chain and a 30-kDa
b-chain that regulates the growth, motility, and morphogenesis. and regeneration of many cell types (6–9). In addition,
HGF plays an important role in hematopoiesis by synergizing
with other cytokines such as stem cell factor, IL-3, erythropoietin, and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (6–9). Consequently, the formation of a naturally occurring
rIL-7/HGFb hybrid cytokine seems designed to regulate lymphohematopoietic stem and progenitor cell development.
Nonetheless, despite the synergistic functions of IL-7 and
HGF on normal cell growth and development, IL-7 and HGF
differ fundamentally with respect to their effects on cancer
cells. In several animal models of neoplasia, IL-7 has been
shown to have antitumor effects mediated by CD4 and/or CD8
T cells (10–16) whereas HGF supported the growth, invasion,
and metastasis of many types of cancers (17). Given the
potential therapeutic use of rIL-7/HGFb to enhance B- and
T-cell reconstitution in immunocompromised patients, especially following BM reconstitution (4), it was important to
determine whether rIL-7/HGFb positively or negatively affects
tumor cell growth in vivo. Toward this end, we have tested the
effect of the local and systemic administration of rIL-7/HGFb
on the growth and metastasis of murine CT-26 colon cancer
and B16F10 melanoma cells. The results showed that the
intratumoral injection of rIL-7/HGFb significantly inhibited
the local growth of newly initiated or established tumors,
apparently by inducing the expansion and activation of tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and DCs. In addition, the systemic administration of rIL-7/HGFb significantly inhibited the
formation of tumor metastases in the lung.

Materials and Methods
Animals and cell lines
Murine CT-26 colon cancer and B16F10 melanoma cells
were obtained from the National Cancer Institute and the
American Type Culture Collection.
Murine breast cancer 66.1 cell line was kindly provided by
Drs. A. M. Fulton and N. Kundu (University of Maryland). Cells
were resuscitated and cultured for less than 3 months before
use in the experiments. American Type Culture Collection
characterized cells by using karyotyping and cytochrome c
oxidase I testing. BALB/c, C57BL/6, and congenitally athymic
nude mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley and
the National Cancer Institute. Mice were housed, treated, and
handled in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the
University of Connecticut Health Center Animal Care Committee. rIL-7 was purchased from PreproTech, eBiosciences,
and R&D Systems. rHGFb and rIL-7/HGFb were cloned,
expressed, and purified as we have described (3, 4).
Evaluation of local tumor growth and pulmonary
metastasis
Cancer cells in the exponential growth phase were harvested and washed in PBS before in vivo injection. To induce
localized tumors, 2  105 CT-26 colon cancer cells (18) or 1 
105 B16F10 melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously (s.
c.) into the flank of syngeneic BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice,
respectively. The indicated doses of rIL-7/HGFb, rIL-7, and/
or rHGFb (or PBS) were then injected s.c. into the tumor
injection site at 2-day intervals over the indicated time period.
Tumor size (volume) was determined twice weekly by caliper
measurements of the shortest (A) and longest (B) diameter,
using the formula V ¼ (A2B)/2. To induce pulmonary metastases, 2  105 CT-26 or B16F10 cancer cells were injected into
the tail vein of syngeneic mice and rIL-7/HGFb or PBS were
injected intravenously (i.v.) at 2-day intervals from days 2 to
18. The animals were euthanized at the indicated times after
tumor inoculation. Metastatic tumor nodules in the subpleural regions of the lungs were counted under a dissecting
microscope.
Evaluation of TILs and DCs
At the indicated time points, the s.c. tumors were excised,
weighed, minced into small fragments, and digested in 1 mg/
mL of collagenase IV (Sigma) and 0.1 mg/mL of DNase (Sigma)
at 37 C for 1 hour. The dissociated cells were then prepared
for phenotypic analysis of T cells and DCs by flow immunocytometry.
Flow immunocytometry
Single-cell suspensions from tumors and draining or nondraining lymph nodes were stained with the following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies: CD4, CD8, CD11c, CD80,
CD86, CD3, and DX5 (BioLegend or BD Biosciences). The
samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(Becton and Dickinson). Data analysis was done using FlowJo
software.

ELISPOT assay
Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay measuring
IFN-g were used to assess the in vitro T-cell responses to
stimulation with CT-26 or B16F10 cells. Splenocytes (1  105 T
cells/well) and irradiated cancer cells (1  105/well) were
incubated for 2 days in 96-well plates (Millipore) coated with
anti-mouse IFN-g antibody (clone R4-6A2; Biolegend) and
blocked with RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum. The wells were then washed and incubated with
biotinylated anti-mouse IFN-g antibody (clone XMG1.2; Biolegend). Reactions were visualized and counted using the
streptavidin-peroxidase system (19).
Statistical analysis
P values were based on 2-sided student's t test. A confidence
level above 95% (P < 0.05) was determined as significant.

Results
rIL-7/HGFb treatment inhibits local tumor growth
To determine whether rIL-7/HGFb has antitumor activity,
murine CT-26 colon cancer cells were injected s.c. into syngeneic BALB/c mice and, at 2-day intervals from days 2 to 24,
the mice were injected at the tumor site with different doses of
rIL-7/HGFb (2.5, 5, 15, and 30 mg/injection) or control vehicle
(PBS). As shown in Figure 1A, tumor growth was inhibited in a
dose-responsive manner, with no detectable effect seen by
day 30 at the 2.5-mg level and greater than 80% inhibition
occurring at the 30-mg level. To compare the antitumor effect
of rIL-7/HGFb with its component cytokines, BALB/c mice
were injected at the tumor site with optimal and equimolar
amounts of rIL-7/HGFb (15 mg/injection), rIL-7 (5 mg/injection), and/or rHGFb (10 mg/injection), according to the abovementioned schedule. As shown in Figure 1B, rIL-7 alone or
mixed with rHGFb inhibited local tumor growth by 30% by
day 30 whereas rHGFb alone had no effect. In contrast, the rIL7/HGFb hybrid cytokine inhibited tumor cell growth by 76%
(P < 0.01). As shown in Figure 1C, the ability of rIL-7/HGFb to
inhibit local tumor growth was not restricted to colon cancer
but applied to malignant melanoma as well. Furthermore, as
shown in Figure 1D, significant antitumor activity was
observed in mice in which rIL-7/HGFb treatment was initiated
10 days after melanomas had been established.
To determine whether rIL-7/HGFb, rIL-7, and/or HGFb
directly affect the growth of tumor cells, CT-26 colon cancer
cells, and B16F10 melanoma cancer cells were cultured in
vitro for 2 to 7 days in the presence of 20 to 150 ng/mL of rIL7/HGFb (or PBS), a dose range that has been shown to
stimulate the proliferation of thymocytes and early B-lineage
cells (4). The rate of tumor cell growth was not significantly
different at any dose level of rIL-7/HGFb from those
observed in control cultures or in cultures containing equimolar amounts of rIL-7 and/or HGFb (data not shown).
Hence, the mechanism by which rIL-7/HGFb inhibits the
growth of CT-26 and B16F10 tumors in vivo would not seem
to involve direct cytotoxic or cytostatic activities. This was
confirmed by the results of experiments in nude mice (see
the following text).

rIL-7/HGFb induces significant infiltration of DCs and
T cells into the tumors
The presence of large proportions of TILs has been
associated with favorable clinical outcomes in cancer
patients (13, 15). We therefore determined whether rIL-7/
HGFb, rIL-7, and/or rHGFb treatment enhanced the presence of TILs in the s.c. murine colon and melanoma tumors.
To normalize for differences in tumor size at the time
sacrifice, we assessed the numbers of TILs per milligram
of tumor tissue. On day 30 after tumor inoculation, singlecell suspensions of tumor tissue from mice treated with
equimolar amounts of rIL-7/HGFb, rIL-7, and/or rHGFb (see
Fig. 1B) were analyzed for CD4þ and CD8þ T cells by flow
cytometry. Because of the role of DCs in the activation of T
cells, we also analyzed for CD11cþ tumor-infiltrating DCs. As
shown in Figure 2A, rIL-7 alone or mixed with rHGFb
significantly, albeit modestly (<2-fold), increased the numbers of CD8þ and CD4þ T cells, but not DCs, in the tumors.
Again, rHGFb alone had no effect. In contrast, rIL-7/HGFb
increased the numbers of DCs as well as CD4þ and CD8þ T
cells 4- to 6-fold above the levels in PBS-injected controls.
Furthermore, as shown in Figure 2B, the DCs in the rIL-7/
HGFb-treated tumors expressed significantly higher levels of
CD80 and CD86 than did those in rIL-7- and/or rHGFbtreated tumors, indicating that they had undergone activation and maturation. In addition to the tumors themselves,
there was a parallel increase in the numbers of CD4þ and
CD8þ T cells and activated DCs in the draining lymph node
(DLN) and the number of NK cells was also significantly
increased (Fig. 3). Similar results were observed in rIL-7/
HGFb-treated B16F10 melanoma-bearing mice (data not
shown).

rIL-7/HGFb treatment induces a tumor-specific
immunologic response
The above-mentioned results suggest that the mechanism
by which rIL-7/HGF inhibits local tumor growth is immunologic involving TILs and activated DCs. To explore this possibility, we examined the number of IFN-g–producing cells
from the DLNs and spleen of cytokine-treated tumor-bearing
mice after in vitro stimulation with syngeneic homologous or
heterologous tumor cells. Cultures containing single-cell suspensions of DLNs or spleen cells (normalized to 1  105 T
cells/well) from day 30 CT-26 colon cancer–bearing mice that
had been treated in vivo with equimolar amounts of rIL-7/
HGFb, rIL-7, and/or rHGFb (or PBS) were stimulated with
irradiated CT-26 cells. Cultures stimulated with irradiated 66.1
murine breast cancer cells served as specificity controls (20).
After 2 days, the numbers of IFN-g–producing cells present
were quantified by ELISPOT assays.
As shown in Figure 4A, the numbers of IFN-g–producing
cells among the cultured DLN cells from rIL-7- and/or HGFbtreated tumors was 2- to 3-fold higher than were those from
PBS-treated controls after stimulation with CT-26 cells. As
expected, treatment with rHGFb alone had no effect. In
contrast, the number of IFN-g–producing cells among the
cultured DLN cells from rIL-7/HGFb–treated tumors was
elevated 6- to 7-fold (P < 0.01). Identical results were obtained
when splenocytes from these same animals were used
(Fig. 4B). However, there was no increase in IFN-g–producing
cells in any of the cultures that were stimulated with breast
cancer cells. Similarly, rIL-7/HGFb treatment significantly
increased the number of tumor-specific IFN-g–producing T
cells in DLNs and spleens of B16F10 melanoma-bearing mice
(data not shown). These results suggest rIL-7/HGFb treatment

greatly enhances both regional and systemic immunologic
responses to tumor-specific antigens in vivo.
rIL-7/HGFb inhibits the formation of pulmonary
metastases in recipients of colon cancer and melanoma
cells
To determine whether rIL-7/HGFb could also inhibit
metastatic disease, BALB/c mice were injected i.v. with

CT-26 cancer cells to establish pulmonary metastases.
The mice were then treated with 15 mg of rIL-7/HGFb or
equimolar doses of rIL-7 and/or HGFb (or PBS). The mice
were euthanized on day 21, the lungs were removed and
weighed, and tumor colonies on the surface of the lung were
counted. As shown in Figure 5A, rIL-7/HGFb treatment
reduced the numbers of metastatic nodules on the lungs
by approximately 5.5-fold as compared with 1.3-fold after
rIL-7 treatment. Proportionate decreases both in lung
weights and in the sizes of the metastatic nodules that
did form also were observed (data not shown). Similar
antimetastatic activity was observed in the lungs of rIL-7/
HGFb–treated C57BL6 mice after i.v. injection of melanoma
cells (Fig. 5B). Of interest, randomly sampled peripheral
lymph nodes contained significantly elevated numbers of
CD4þ and CD8þ T cells, activated DCs, and NK cells following the systemic administration of rIL-7/HGFb similar to
those observed in the DLNs after the local administration of
rIL-7/HGFb (data not shown). These results suggest that T
cells, DCs, and NK cells may also be involved in the antimetastatic activity of rIL-7/HGFb.

Inhibition of local tumor growth by rIL-7/HGFb does
not occur in nude mice
To confirm that T cells were involved in the antitumor
activity of rIL-7/HGFb, the previous experiments were
repeated in congenitally athymic (nude) mice. In contrast
to its effects in euthymic mice, rIL-7/HGFb failed to inhibit
local tumor growth in nude mice by both CT-26 colon cancer
cells (Fig. 6A) and B16F10 melanoma cells (Fig. 6C). In
contrast, the antimetastatic activity of rIL-7/HGFb was only
partly lost in nude mice (Fig. 6B and D). These results
suggested that, even if the expanded T cells and activated
DCs seen in rIL-7/HGFb–treated euthymic mice inhibit the
formation of metastases (Fig. 5), rIL-7/HGFb must use a
different mechanism(s) to achieve the same result in nude
mice.

Figure 3. Treatment of localized tumors with rIL-7/HGFb increases the numbers of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells, CD11cþ DCs, and NK cells in the DLNs. Single-cell
suspensions of DLNs from the cytokine-treated tumors (see Fig. 2) were analyzed for the numbers of CD11cþ DCs, CD4þ and CD8þ T cells, and CD3DX5þ NK
cells. Data represent mean numbers of positive cells  SD from 4 to 6 mice per group. *, P < 0.05 as compared with the PBS-treated group; **, P < 0.05 as

Discussion
We show here that the local injection of rIL-7/HGFb at the
site of tumor cell inoculation significantly inhibited tumor

A

growth in murine models of colon cancer and malignant
melanoma. Importantly, rIL-7/HGFb was effective whether
given at the time of tumor cell inoculation or after tumors had
been established. In addition, the systemic administration of
rIL-7/HGFb inhibited the formation of pulmonary metastases
in these tumor models.
The antitumor effects of rIL-7/HGFb were associated with
increased percentages and numbers of TILs and activated DCs
in the tumors. In addition, rIL-7/HGFb enhanced tumor-specific regional and systemic T-cell responses in lymph nodes and
spleen cells, as shown by differential stimulation of INFg–secreting cells in vitro. These results suggested that the
major mechanism by which rIL-7/HGFb inhibited tumor cell
growth was immunologic rather than directly cytostatic or
cytotoxic. This was confirmed by the inability of rIL-7/HGFb to
prevent tumor formation in nude mice or to inhibit tumor cell
growth in vitro. We presume therefore that rIL-7/HGFb inhibits
local tumor cell growth by activating (and possibly attracting)
T cells and DCs, which work in concert with NK cells to inhibit
tumor cell growth and survival (20–22). However, the results
also suggest that an additional, T-cell–independent mechanism may also enable systemically administered rIL-7/HGFb to
inhibit the formation of metastases (as opposed to solid
tumors), which continues to occur in nude mice.
Several studies have shown that IL-7 has antitumor activity
(10–16). For example, tumor cell lines transfected with the IL-7
gene had reduced, T-cell–dependent tumorigenicity in vivo
(10, 11). Similarly, the local or systemic administration of rIL-7
had antitumor effects (12, 13), especially when combined with
cancer vaccines (15, 16). Our data also showed that rIL-7 could
inhibit both tumor growth and the formation of metastases by
CT-26 colon cancer cells. However, when given in the same
molar amounts, our data show that rIL-7/HGFb was significantly more effective than rIL-7 (and/or HGFb) in inhibiting
tumor formation. This difference may be qualitative as well as
quantitative, as rIL-7/HGFb could activate tumor-infiltrating
DCs whereas rIL-7 did not. This is understandable, as DCs

express the receptors for both IL-7 and HGF (5, 23–25), and, as
we have previously shown in dual receptor B- and T-lineage
cells (4), juxtacrine interactions secondary to receptor crosslinking by rIL-7/HGFb may result in novel functional readouts,
such as cell survival, activation, and maturation. Of course, it is
also possible that rIL-7/HGFb may indirectly affect DCs by
stimulating other cell types to generate DC stimulatory factors
(26). In contrast, although both rIL-7 and rHGF have been
shown to individually affect DCs, they primarily influence the
development of immature DCs from intrathymic precursors
and peripheral blood monocytes (5, 27–30). In addition, IL-7
has been shown to downregulate the expression of MHC II on
DCs and to diminish the homeostatic proliferation of CD4þ T
cells in a lymphopenic setting (31). HGF can also affect DC
development, although the results vary. On the one hand, HGF
has been reported to induce CD34þ BM cells to generate DCs
that could stimulate T-cell proliferation (23). On the other
hand, HGF has been found to favor the development of
tolerogenic DCs from monocytes (24) and to suppress DC
functions such as antigen presentation (25).
Similarly, although many studies have shown that IL-7 can
directly stimulate the survival and proliferation of T cells (5),
our data showed that rIL-7/HGFb treatment induced the
appearance of significantly larger numbers of CD4þ and
CD8þ T cells in the tumors and DLNs than did rIL-7 treatment
(with or without rHGFb). This may be related to the activation
of DCs by rIL-7/HGFb but not by rIL-7. Hence, rIL-7/HGFb has
distinct advantages over its component cytokines regarding
not only the activation of DCs but, as a likely consequence,
also the activation of antigen-specific T cells.
Importantly, many studies have shown that HGF/c-Met
signaling plays a major role in stimulating the growth, invasion, and metastasis of a wide variety of cancers in vivo and

that it also stimulates the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro
(17). This, of course, raised concerns that HGFb, alone or when
complexed with IL-7, might do the same. However, the present
study with colon cancer and melanoma show that this is not
the case. Rather, our results show that rHGFb, whether given
alone or mixed with rIL-7, did not stimulate tumor cell growth
in vitro, even though the cells expressed c-Met. This is consistent with reports that HGFb binds to c-Met and is required
for the mitogenic activity of HGF, but it does not by itself
stimulate cell growth (32, 33). Even more reassuring, our
results show that the HGFb component of rIL-7/HGFb seems
to enhance the antitumor effects of the IL-7 component.
Therefore, whether used alone or in combination with other
therapeutic agents, rIL-7/HGFb not only may prove useful in
the treatment of cancer but also does not seem to pose a risk
of provoking tumor growth (or recurrence) if used in the
treatment of nonneoplastic lymphohematopoietic disorders.
