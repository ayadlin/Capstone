ABSTRACT
Whereas the role of the G-protein-coupled APJ receptor and its ligand, apelin,
in angiogenesis has been well documented, the ability of the apelin/APJ system to
induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis has been largely unexplored.
To this end, we first show that APJ is expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)
and, moreover, that it responds to apelin by activating the apelinergic signaling
cascade. We find that although apelin treatment does not influence the proliferation
of LECs in vitro, it enhances their migration, protects them against UV irradiationinduced apoptosis, increases their spheroid numbers in 3D culture, stimulates their
in vitro capillary-like tube formation and, furthermore, promotes the invasive growth
of lymphatic microvessels in vivo in the matrigel plug assay. We also demonstrate
that apelin overexpression in malignant cells is associated with accelerated in vivo
tumor growth and with increased intratumoral lymphangiogenesis and lymph node
metastasis. These results indicate that apelin induces lymphangiogenesis and,
accordingly, plays an important role in lymphatic tumor progression. Our study does
not only reveal apelin as a novel lymphangiogenic factor but might also open the
door for the development of novel anticancer therapies targeting lymphangiogenesis.

inflammation, wound healing, renal and corneal graft
rejection [1] but lymphatics are insufficient in patients
with primary or secondary lymphoedema [2]. Although
lymphatic spread frequently occurs in solid malignancies
and is considered an indicator of local dissemination and
poor prognosis, a long-established concept has assigned
a passive role to lymphatics in tumor progression.
However, recent animal studies using lymphangiogenic
molecules have indicated that lymphatic vessels interact
extensively with malignant cells and, moreover, that
lymphangiogenesis is associated with, and can enhance,
lymph node (LN) metastasis. The most widely studied
molecular system that facilitates the expansion of
the lymphatic network both under physiological and
pathological conditions is the VEGF-C/ -D / VEGFR-3
signaling pathway. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the
molecular mechanisms that underlie lymphangiogenesis
still lags far behind that of the vascular system [3].
Apelin has been recognized as the endogenous
ligand of the human G protein–coupled receptor APJ
[4], a member of the seven-transmembrane-receptor
family. During embryonic development, APJ expression
is largely restricted to the endothelial cells of the
developing vascular system [5] and apelin is essential
for vascular patterning of the embryo [6]. Nevertheless,
apelin and its receptor are strongly expressed in the adult
blood vasculature as well [7], and apelin was reported to
stimulate blood endothelial cell growth in various in vitro
[8, 9] and in vivo [6, 9] angiogenesis models. It has also
been demonstrated that apelin can induce the maturation
of tumor blood capillaries [10] and, moreover, that the
apelin-APJ system is able to increase the vascularization
and growth of different murine tumors [11]. Moreover,
apelin was found to be upregulated in some human
cancers [12-14], and both our group [15] and others [16,
17] demonstrated a direct association of apelin expression
with angiogenesis and/or clinical outcome in malignant
disease.
Apelin probably also has lymphangiogenic potential,
however, evidence supporting this view has hitherto been
obtained only in two very recent studies on the role of
apelin in inflammation [18] and lymphatic development
[19]. Therefore, and given the apelinergic system’s well
established angiogenic potential under both physiological
and pathological conditions, the present study was
conducted to examine additional aspects of the apelin-APJ
pathway in lymph vessel growth.
Here, we use in vitro and in vivo assays to dissect the
role of apelin in lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic tumor
spread. First, we investigate APJ expressions of LECs and
analyze the downstream pathways upon activation of APJ
signaling. Next, we assess LECs’ in vitro proliferation,
migration, apoptosis and tube as well as spheroid
formation following apelin treatment. We also quantify
the in vivo effect of exogenous apelin on lymph vessel
growth in the Matrigel plug system. Finally, we study
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

whether transfection of tumor cells with apelin expression
constructs results in an increase in lymphangiogenesis
and LN metastasis in vivo. Our results provide the first
direct evidence that apelin induces lymphangiogenesis and
lymphatic metastasis.

RESULTS
APJ is expressed by human LECs and apelin
activates its downstream signaling
RT-PCR and immunocytochemical analysis of
HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and
LECs demonstrated the presence of APJ mRNA (Fig.
1.A) and protein (Fig. 1. B-C) expressions, respectively.
In order to demonstrate that APJ is functionally active
in LECs, we investigated the activation of previously
described downstream signaling molecules [8, 20].
We found that apelin led to a significantly increased
phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt after 5 and 15
minutes treatment, respectively. Activation of S6 was
not significant following apelin treatment (Fig. 1. D-E).
Thus, APJ expressed in human LECs responds to apelin
treatment by inducing the activation of the Erk and PI3KAkt pathways as we described in other cell types as well
[8, 20].

Apelin does not increase the in vitro growth of
LECs but promotes their migration and protects
them against apoptosis
To investigate whether apelin alters LEC growth in
vitro, the effect of apelin treatment on cell proliferation
was studied by BrdU incorporation assay. Of note,
exogenous apelin did not alter the in vitro proliferation
rate of these cells, when compared with untreated cells
after 96 h (Fig. 2. A-B).
Apelin has been shown to reduce apoptosis in
various cell types, including retinal Müller cells [21],
osteoblasts [22], neurons [23], vascular smooth muscle
cells [24] and blood endothelial cells as well [6]. We used
TUNEL analysis to investigate whether the apelin-APJ
system can also inhibit programmed cell death in LECs.
Using a standard serum starvation protocol, we found
that 48 h serum deprivation did not result in significant
apoptosis induction in LECs. However, administration of 1
µM apelin significantly suppressed UV irradiation-induced
apoptosis of LECs (P<0.05; Fig. 2. C-F).
Next, we sought to determine the effect of apelin
on human LEC migration. Using long-term time-lapse
videomicroscopy in 2D cell cultures [25] (Fig. 3. A-B),
we found that apelin at 100 nM significantly increased
cell migration (P<0.05; Fig. 3. C-D), indicating a pro4427

migratory potential for apelin in addition to its antiapoptotic role in human LECs. Importantly, while APJ
inhibition by F13A (an APJ antagonist) alone did not result
in significant changes in cell migration, it reduced apelininduced LEC migration in a dose-dependent manner with
complete inhibition when apelin and F13A was given at
1:1 ratio (P<0.05; Fig. 3. C-D). Representative pictures of
the LECs’ trajectories and their average migrated distance
for 12 h intervals are also shown in Figure 3. A-B.

(Fig. 4. C), apelin (at 1 µM) significantly increased the
number of LEC spheroids, when compared with untreated
cells after 96 h (P<0.05; Fig. 4. D).
Endothelial tube formation assays are also regarded
as in vitro models of more advanced stages of (lymph)
angiogenesis and are also often used to test the effects of
different pro- and anti-(lymph)angiogenic molecules [28].
Thus, we examined the ability of apelin to promote LEC
tube formation in a Matrigel tube formation assay and
found that apelin (at 1 µM) was effective in promoting
LEC differentiation into vascular structures in vitro
(P<0.05 vs. control; Fig. 5. D). The extent of this effect
was comparable to that of bFGF (basic fibroblast growth
factor) at 20 ng/mL, which was used as a positive control
(P<0.05 vs. control; Fig. 5. D).
The Matrigel plug technique was used to study
the effect of apelin on the invasive growth of lymphatic
capillaries in mice. Corroborating the lymphangiogenic
potential of apelin seen in the above described in vitro
assays, LVDs were significantly higher in Matrigel plugs
containing apelin (0.25 μg) or bFGF (0.25 μg) than in
those with PBS only (P<0.05 in case of both apelin and
bFGF); Fig. 5. E).

Apelin increases LEC spheroid numbers and
stimulates capillary-like cord formation of LECs
in vitro and, moreover, promotes the growth of
lymph vessels in the Matrigel plug model in vivo
Three-dimensional spheroid endothelial cell models
(introduced by Korff and Augustin in 1998 [26]) are useful
tools for the analysis of the activity of pro- and antiangiogenic factors. Because apelin-APJ signaling has been
reported to enhance proliferation and assembly of blood
endothelial cells in spheroid cultures [27], we also tested
the effects of apelin on the formation of multicellular
spheroid structures by LECs (Fig. 4). Although apelin
treatments at different doses (10 nM or 1 µM) did not
result in significantly elevated mean spheroid diameters

We were also interested in investigating
whether transfection of tumor cells with apelin
expression constructs results in an increase in tumor
lymphangiogenesis in vivo. Our studies to address this
goal involved experiments with B16 mouse melanoma

or with an empty plasmid vector (B16-mock) [29]. In the
first set of animal experiments, we implanted tumor cells
subcutaneously into the upper back of mice and assessed
tumor volumes (Fig. 6. A) and intratumoral LVDs (Fig. 6.
B-D). Importantly, morphometrical analysis using LYVE1 as a LEC marker (Fig. 6. B, D) revealed significantly
higher LVDs present in the apelin-overexpressing
tumors as compared with controls (P<0.05; Fig. 6. C). In
addition, as expected [29], tumor growth was significantly
accelerated in mice injected with B16-apelin cells
compared with mice carrying B16-mock tumors (Fig. 6.
A).
Stimulation of intratumoral lymph capillary
formation by apelin raised the possibility that this peptide
might also enhance lymphatic metastasis. Thus, to further
explore the role of apelin in lymphatic tumor progression,
B16-apelin and B16-mock cells were also injected into
the right hind footpads of mice in groups of ten animals
per cell line. Two weeks after implantation, B16 tumors
increased rapidly in size. Three weeks after injection,
when the primary tumors were 5–9 mm in diameter (Fig.
6. E-F), the animals were anaesthetized, and the ipsilateral
inguinal LN regions were carefully examined under a
stereomicroscope. In case of each animal, the LNs as
well as the surrounding fat tissues were then removed and
embedded into paraffin for serial sectioning. 8 of 9 (one
mouse died at day 2 after tumor implantation in this group)
animals (89%) in the B16-apelin group showed metastases
by stereomicroscopic inspection (Fig. 6. G; metastatic LN
from one representative mouse) and histology (Fig. 6. H).
By contrast, only 3 of 10 animals (30%) in the B16-mock
group had LN metastases (Fig. 6. I; P<0.05).

functions of APJ signaling during lymphatic development
in zebrafish embryogenesis, Kim et al. also found that
the knockdown of APJ in LECs selectively reduced
the basal levels of phospho-Akt, but without affecting
the phosphorylation status of Erk [19]. These authors,
however, investigated the impact of APJ signaling
abrogation on the basal phospho-Erk levels of LECs in the
presence of FBS (fetal bovine serum), while we analyzed
the effect of apelin stimulation in serum-deprived LECs,
which raises the possibility that the lack of decrease in
Erk phosphorylation in their study was due to their
different experimental approach. The results presented in
the current paper are indeed consistent with our group’s
earlier studies reporting that apelin induces the activation
of both the PI3K-Akt and the Erk intracellular cascades
in HUVECs (with endogenous APJ expression) and also
in Chinese hamster ovary cells that have been stably
transfected with APJ [8, 20]. Of note, both Akt [22, 24]
and Erk [31-33] have also been shown to be downstream
effectors of APJ signaling in various additional cell types
including osteoblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells,
embryonic kidney cells, neurons and cardiomyocytes
(reviewed in ref. [34]). Additionally, VEGF-C/VEGFR3
in LECs are also known to activate Akt and Erk signaling
and, moreover, both molecular pathways have been
implicated in both developmental and pathological
lymphangiogenesis [35, 36]. Therefore, further studies are
required to better understand the complex crosstalk among
these intracellular cascades during lymphangiogenesis.
APJ activation has been demonstrated to promote
cell migration in a variety of cell types including retinal
endothelial [9], Müller glial [37], oral squamous cell
carcinoma [16] and mesendodermal [38] cells. In line with
these studies, we also found a significant pro-migratory
effect of apelin on LECs. Of note, our results gained by
using long-term time-lapse videomicroscopy in 2D cell
cultures are also in accordance with the findings of the
recent study of Sawane et al. [18], in which they used
a transwell migration assay to evaluate the migratory
response of LECs to apelin. It is also important to mention
that the pro-migratory effect of apelin was reduced in a
dose-dependent manner by the addition of F13A (an apelin
mutant that has been considered as an APJ antagonist [14,
37, 39]). Our current findings, thus, suggest that F13A acts
as a competitive antagonist on LECs when apelin-13 is
present.
EC spheroids are increasingly used for evaluating
the pro- and anti-angiogenic potential of various factors
and drugs [40]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that
endothelial cells retain differentiated phenotypic properties
in 3D spheroids while they tend to lose them in monolayer
cultures [26]. Accordingly, we also evaluated the effects
of apelin on the formation of LEC spheroids, and found
that although it did not have an effect on spheroid sizes,
it increased significantly their numbers. This observation,
taken together with our further in vitro finding that apelin

DISCUSSION
Major progress has been made over the past two
decades in understanding the molecular regulation
of lymph vessel formation. Recent studies on
lymphangiogenesis have been focused on two molecules
of the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) family,
VEGF-C and -D, which are the ligands for VEGFR-3
(VEGF receptor-3) [1, 3]. Although various therapeutic
drugs have already been generated to target this molecular
machinery, recent results suggest that lymphangiogenesis
is a complex process which is regulated by additional
signaling pathways [3, 30]. Further efforts are, therefore,
needed for the better understanding of lymphatic biology
to identify novel lymphangiogenic molecules and to
develop more effective treatments for lymphangiogenesisrelated diseases, including cancer. In the present study, we
provide evidence that apelin acts both in vitro and in vivo
as a lymphangiogenic factor and, accordingly, that it has
an important role in LN metastasis.
First, we showed that LECs express APJ in vitro
and that apelin acts through APJ to increase Erk and
Akt phosphorylation. In a recent study investigating the

conditions. The very recent paper of Kim et al. about the
essential role of the apelin/APJ pathway during embryonic
lymphatic development [19] puts this idea into an even
broader perspective implying that the effects of apelin/APJ
signaling on LECs are conserved from fishes to mammals
and throughout embryonic development to adulthood.
In conclusion, our study identifies apelin as a
novel tumor lymphangiogenic factor that enhances LN
metastasis. Accordingly, and based also on our group’s
previous studies, the apelinergic system stimulates
tumor progression through the following mechanisms:
1./ promotion of blood capillary formation [11, 15], 2./
autocrine growth stimulation of malignant cells [14], and
3./ enhancement of intratumoral lymphangiogenesis and
LN metastasis. Development of potential future therapies
targeting this complex pro-tumor function of the apelin/
APJ pathway is thus especially intriguing as it might offer
benefits to patients with malignant diseases.

stimulates the capillary-like tube formation of LECs,
suggests an important role for apelin in the development
of patent lymph capillaries via promoting a pro-adhesive
state in the lymphatic endothelium. This assumption
is also supported by recent studies reporting that apelin
induces the endothelial expression of various intercellular
adhesion molecules [10, 41, 42] and, accordingly, that it
enhances the integrity of both blood and lymph capillaries
[18, 43].
The apelinergic system is expressed in a diverse
range of tissues with particular predominance in the
blood vasculature [34, 44]. Accordingly, apelin has been
shown to stimulate blood vascular EC growth in various
in vitro [8, 9] and in vivo [6, 9] angiogenesis systems,
including a mouse model of cancer [11]. Earlier studies
have also provided evidence for apelin expression in
human glioblastoma [12] and breast cancer [13]. We
demonstrated recently a direct association of apelin
expression with angiogenesis and clinical outcome in
human non-small cell lung cancer [15] and, moreover,
showed that autocrine apelin/APJ signaling participates
in human colorectal cancer growth [14]. Another group
demonstrated the prognostic significance of apelin
expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma as well [16].
Most recently, circulating apelin levels were reported to
be significantly increased in cancer patients (vs. healthy
controls) and, moreover, to correlate with disease stage
and prognosis [17]. Nevertheless, although the role of
the apelinergic system during tumor progression and
blood vessel formation has been an emerging focus of
cancer and vascular research in recent years, whether
and how apelin/APJ signaling contributes to tumorinduced lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis
remains unclear. Thus, given the biological and clinical
significance of apelin in the progression of human cancers,
we hypothesized that it might enhance tumor progression
by exerting a stimulatory effect on lymph vessel formation
as well. Investigating the lymphangiogenic activity
of apelin in the in vivo Matrigel plug model, we found
that apelin-containing Matrigel plugs had significantly
higher lymph vessel counts than those with PBS alone.
This effect of apelin was comparable to that of bFGF
which is known as a potent lymphangiogenic factor
[45]. More importantly, apelin overexpression of murine
B16 melanoma cells significantly increased the burden
and intratumoral lymphangiogenesis of tumors growing
subcutaneously in mice. These data were corroborated
by the observation of enhanced LN metastasis in mice
carrying apelin-transfected primary tumors. Two recent
studies from Sawane et al. reported that apelin decreases
UVB-induced lymphatic capillary hyperpermeability
[18] and stabilizes lymph capillary walls in a high-fat
diet mouse model [43]. These data further support our
results and, taken together with our findings, suggest
that the apelinergic system regulates the adult lymphatic
endothelium under both physiological and pathological

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
The B16 mouse melanoma cells stably transfected
with murine apelin (B16-apelin) or with the empty
plasmid vector (B16-mock) have been described in ref.
[29]. HUVECs were purchased from Lonza (Walkersville,
USA) and cultured in the manufacturer’s recommended
medium (EGM®-2 BulletKit®, Lonza) at 370C in a
humified incubator with 5% CO2. Telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT)-transduced LECs (isolated from
human foreskins, and generated and characterized as
described previously [46, 47]), were grown in the same
environment but in the EGM®-2-MV BulletKit® (Lonza)
medium.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from HUVECs and LECs
using TRIzol® Reagent® (Invitrogen) and purified with
DNAfree DNase kit (Applied Biosystems, California,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 2 μg of
total RNA from each sample were reverse transcribed
using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit
(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed
using the cDNA as template with TaqMan Universal PCR
Master mix (Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan premade
gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) to amplify
APJ (Hs00270873_s1). All reactions were conducted as
follows: 50ºC for 2 min and 40 cycles of 10s at 95ºC and
1 min at 60ºC in an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-time
PCR System. All samples were assayed in triplicate and
control water samples were included in each experiment.

The endogenous expression reference was the β-actin gene
(Hs03023880_g1).

Apelin-13 was added to the cells at 10 nM or 1 µM at the
time of seeding. 96 hours after plating all spheroids in each
well were photographed. In order to exclude small cell
clumps from the analysis, only the spheres with a diameter
over 100µm were counted and their diameter measured on
the digital photographs using Image-J software.

APJ receptor protein expression in HUVECs and
human LECs
For immuncytochemical stainings, HUVECs and
human LECs (105 cells/well of a 24-well plate) were
plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips. After 16 hours,
cells were fixed in 4% PFA (10 min) and permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton-X 100 solution (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) for
1 minute. Then the cells were incubated with a mouse antihuman APJ antibody (1:20; R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
USA). Biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories,
California, USA) served as the secondary antibody
and was detected by fluorescein streptavidin (Jackson
Immunoresearch, West Grove, USA). For the negative
control, the primary antibody was omitted and only the
secondary antibody was applied. Finally, counterstaining
was performed using propidium-iodide (PI; Partec,
Görlitz, Germany). All samples were viewed by confocal
laser scanning microscopy using the LSM 700 system
(Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany).

Migration assay
The motility responses of human LECs to apelin
were analysed by long-term time-lapse videomicroscopy
in 2D cell cultures as described recently [25]. Briefly,
LECs were plated in a 24-well plates (Corning Inc.) in
a serum-free EBM-2 medium. The medium was changed
to CO2-independent medium (Gibco, Paisley, UK) after
the overnight cell attachment and apelin-13 or apelin13(F13A) (an APJ antagonist) [14, 37, 39] was added
into the medium at 50 or 100 nM concentrations. Cells
were kept in a custom designed incubator built around
an inverted phase-contrast microscope (World Precision
Instruments, Florida, USA) at 37°C and room ambient
atmosphere. Images of 3 neighbouring microscopic fields
were taken in every 5 min for 1 day before and 2 days after
the treatment. For migration data, pictures were analysed
individually with a cell-tracking program enabling manual
marking of individual cells and recording their position
parameters. The parameter migrated distance is calculated
by averaging for each cell the displacement for the first
24 hour interval after treatment, in two independent
experiments and 4 microscopic fields.

In vitro Cell Proliferation Studies
Cell proliferation was examined using the 5-bromo2´-deoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich Co.) incorporation
assay. 4x103 human LECs per well were plated in a flatbottomed 96-well plate in serum-free medium, and
were treated with apelin-13 (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals,
Karlsruhe, Germany) at 0.5, 1, 10 and 100 nM
concentrations. After 96 h, 2 mg/ml BrdU was added into
the medium and the cells were incubated for an additional
2 hours at 370C. BrdU-positive cells were labeled with
anti-BrdU antibody (Becton-Dickinson, New Jersey,
USA). Biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories)
served as the secondary antibody and was detected by
fluorescein streptavidin (Jackson Immunoresearch).
Finally, all nuclei were stained with PI (Partec). Three
random fields from 3 wells were photographed and the
number of BrdU-positive and PI-positive cells in each
field counted. The percentage of the BrdU-positive cells
was calculated and averaged.

Tube formation assay
Liquefied 10 mg/ml Matrigel Basement Membrane
Matrix (0.289 ml/well; BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA)
was used to coat wells of a 24-well plate and then allowed
to polymerize at 370C for a minimum of 30 min. 105 cells
per well were seeded on basal membrane extract in serumfree, EBM-2 medium (Lonza). The cells were treated with
1 µM apelin-13 (Phoenix) or 20 ng/ml FGF (Eubio) and
incubated 16-18 hours at 370C. Capillary-like structures
within the Matrigel layer were then photographed and
analyzed using Image J morphometry software.

Apoptosis assay

LEC spheroid growth assay

5x104 cells per well were cultured in a 24-well plate.
After 24 hours, the cells were treated with 1 µM apelin-13.
Apoptosis of cells was induced with an UV dose of
200mW/cm2 for 10 seconds. After 48 hours incubation,
cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min. Apoptosis assay
was carried out using the “In Situ Cell Death Detection”
kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and the protocol
recommended by the manufacturer. Finally, cells were

To establish spheroid cultures from LECs,
3x104 cells were seeded in triplicate in DMEM/Ham’s
F-12 medium (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria)
supplemented with 20 ng/ml bFGF; (Eubio, Wien,
Austria), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma)
and 2% B27 supplement (PAA Laboratories) in ultra low
attachment 24-well plates (Corning Inc., New York, USA).

twice. Tumor allografts were established by injecting
mice subcutaneously with 1x106 B16-apelin or B16-mock
cells under anesthesia with a combination of tiletamine
hypochloride, zolazepam hypochloride, xylazin and
butorphanol. Tumor size was measured every two days
with a caliper and expressed in mm3 by the formula for
the volume of a prolate ellipsoid (length x width2 π/6),
as described previously [15, 48]. Tumors were removed
from mice after 18 days of growth and were fresh-frozen
in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. Lymph vessel
densities (LVDs) were determined by labeling of lymph
capillaries with rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1 (ReliaTech)
and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson
ImmunoResearch). Three sections per tumor were
analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope. Digital
images were captured and analyzed with a SPOT digital
camera (Diagnostic Instruments) and the ImageJ software,
respectively and as described previously [49, 50].
To study the LN metastatic potential of B16apelin primary tumors, in another set of in vivo tumor
experiments, groups of ten mice were injected with B16apelin or B16-mock cells (1x106 cells per animal) in a
total volume of 100 μl into the right hind footpad. Animals
were euthanized and autopsied at 3 weeks postinoculation
when the primary tumors reached 5-10 mm in diameter.
Metastatic involvement of the ipsilateral inguinal
sentinel LNs was evaluated with a stereomicroscope
(Alpha, Woking, UK). The right-side inguinal LN of
each animal were then collected, embedded in paraffin,
serial sectioned, stained with haematoxylin and eosin and
evaluated by a pathologist (BD).

Western Blot Analysis
LECs exposed to 1 µM apelin in serum-free medium
(EBM-2, Lonza) for different time durations were lysed
in RIPA-buffer (Fischer Scientific, Loughborough, UK),
centrifuged, and protein was denatured before loading.
Each sample was subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS)–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins
were electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
and immunodetected with antibodies against AktpAkt, Erk1/2-pErk1/2, S6-pS6 (all from Cell Signaling
Technologies, Massachusetts, USA) and β-actin (Sigma).
Blots were then incubated with appropriate HRP-labeled
secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford,
IL, USA) and signals were detected by using the ECL
system (GE Healthcare, Dassel, Germany). Activation of
signaling was quantified as the ratio of phosphorylated and
total protein densitometry measurements.

Matrigel plug assay
Groups of three C57BL/6 mice were injected
subcutaneously with 0.25 ml Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
containing PBS, 0.25 μg bFGF (Eubio), or 0.25 μg apelin
(Phoenix Pharmaceuticals). One week after implantation,
the plug was removed, and cryosections (5 μm) were
prepared for immunohistochemistry. After labeling with
rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1 and rhodamine-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (purchased from ReliaTech, Braunschweig,
Germany and Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove,
PA, respectively), sections were examined using a Nikon
Eclipse 80i microscope and digital images were captured
using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments,
Sterling Heights, MI). Quantitative analyses of the
LYVE-1-positive lymphatic vessels in the Matrigels were
performed using ImageJ software.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were compared with Student’s
t-test if the sample distribution was normal or with MannWhitney U test if the sample distribution was asymmetric.
Categorical data were compared using Fisher’s exact
probability and χ2 tests. Differences were determined to
be significant if p<0.05. All statistical analyses were done
using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.; La
Jolla, CA) software.
