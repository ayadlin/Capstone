ABSTRACT
Millepachine (MIL) was a novel chalcone that was separated from Millettia
pachycarpa Benth (Leguminosae). We found MIL induced apoptosis through activating
NF-κB pathway both in SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells. Western blot showed that MIL
increased the levels of IKKα, p-IKKα/β, p-IκBα and NF-κB (p65) proteins, and
decreased the expression of IκBα protein. Immunohistochemistry analysis indicated
that translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus increased in both ovarian cancer cells.
EMSA assay proved MIL enhanced NF-κB DNA-binding activity in the nuclear. That
specific NF-κB inhibitors alleviated MIL-induced apoptosis suggested NF-κB activation
showed a pro-apoptotic function in SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells. Since NF-κB could be
activated by double strand breaks and showed a pro-apoptotic function in the DNA
damage response, SCGE assay and western blot revealed that MIL caused DNA strand
breaks and significantly increased the level of p-ATM protein and further increased
the levels of p-IKKα/β and NF-κB (p65) protein in SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells, while
a specific ATM inhibitor could alleviated these effects. Moreover, Topoisomerase II
drug screening kit and computer modeling assay were used to prove that MIL induced
the production of linear DNA and inhibited the activity of topoisomerase II through
binding with Topoisomerase II-Cleaved DNA complex to stabilize the complex. Taken
together, our results identified that MIL exhibited anti-tumor activity through inhibiting
topoisomerase II activity to induce tumor cells DNA damage, and MIL-activated NF-κB
pathway showed a pro-apoptotic function in response to DNA damage.

INTRODUCTION

proteins including ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM),
ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) and DNA-dependent
protein kinases (DNA-PK) [5–7]. Depending on the cell
type and the severity and extent of DNA damage, the
activated DDR can elicit different cellular responses. Mild
DNA damage normally leads to the induction of cell cycle
arrest, whereas severe and irreparable injury leads to the
cellular response towards induction of senescence or cell
death programs, such as apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe,
autophagy and other processes [1, 8].
Induction of DNA damage is the mechanism of most
anti-cancer drugs [9]. These drugs include cispaltin and
carboplatin causing cross-linking of DNA and ultimately

Genomic stability is constantly threatened by DNA
damage arising from numerous intrinsic and environmental
sources [1, 2]. Failure to repair DNA damage can lead to
mutations, genomic instability, premature aging, mental
multiplex retardation and other developmental disorders
as well as cancer. Consequently, cells have involved a
sophisticated signal of DNA repair mechanisms to sense
different types of DNA damage and safeguard the genome,
which was called DNA damage response (DDR) [3, 4].
The DDR would activate DNA repair and DNA damage
signaling pathways by phosphorylating the downstream

triggering apoptosis, alkylating agent temozolomide,
topoisomerase inhibitors such as irinotecan and etoposide,
and PARP inhibitors such as Olaparib and BSI-201, which
demonstrate great potential in various cancer treatments
in clinical trials [10–12]. Furthermore, drugs inducing
DNA damage are more likely to target highly proliferative
cancer cells.
DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that regulate the
overwinding or underwinding of DNA, which are divided
into two classes: topoisomerase I cuts and reanneals one
strand of a DNA double helix to induce DNA single-strand
break (SSB), and topoisomerase II cuts and reanneals both
strand of one DNA double helix to induce DNA doublestrand break (DSB) [13]. Topoisomerase II is the target of
important chemotherapeutic agents. Most topoisomerase II
inhibitors have been in clinical use for many years, such as
etoposide, doxorubicin and mitoxantrone [14–16].
Millepachine (MIL), a novel natural chalcone
separated from Millettia pachycarpa Benth, has been
reported in our previous study to induces G2/M arrest
by inhibiting CDK1 activity and causing apoptosis
via ROS-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in human
hepatocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo [17]. Here, we
found that MIL showed significant anti-tumor activity
against human ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. Further
study revealed that MIL exhibited anti-tumor activity
through inhibiting topoisomerase II activity to induce
tumor cells DNA damage, and MIL-activated NF-κB
pathway showed a pro-apoptotic function in response to
DNA damage.

(Supplementary Table S1). The average tumor weights
of MIL-treated groups were 0.22 ± 0.04 g (P < 0.001)
for SK-OV-3 and 0.83 ± 0.10 g (P < 0.001) for A2780S
tumor models in comparison to 1.13 ± 0.15 g and
3.44 ± 0.35 g of control groups (Figure 1D). Notably,
MIL at 20 mg/kg i.v administration exhibited better tumor
inhibition than positive drug (paclitaxel (PAC)) at 5 mg/kg
(Supplementary Table S1). In addition, no body weight
loss was observed during the treatment of MIL in two
xenograft models (Figure 1B, 1C).

MIL induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells
To further investigate the antitumor mechanism of
MIL, we first observed the morphology of SK-OV-3 and
A2780S cells after treatment of MIL. We found obvious
change of cells with characteristics of cell shrinking,
nucleus breaking into apoptotic bodies with MIL treatment
for 48 h (Figure 2A). The results of flow cytometry with
propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V-FITC labeling
proved that MIL induced concentration-dependent
apoptosis in SK-OV-3 with the percentage of apoptosis
cells from 11.75%–34.8% compared with 2.42% for the
control group. MIL also induced apoptosis in A2780S
cells in concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2B). As
caspases play key roles in programmed cell apoptosis, the
activity of caspases in two ovarian cancer cells was also
measured with a colorimetric test system. As shown in
Figure 2C, the activity of caspase 3 and 9 had an obvious
increase, but the activity of caspase 8 had little changes
between control and MIL-treatment cells in both ovarian
cancer cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemical of
TUNEL confirmed that MIL displayed a strong apoptosis
inducing effect in MIL-treated tumor tissues (Figure 2D).

RESULTS
MIL strongly inhibited proliferation of human
ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo

MIL activated NF-κB and NF-κB-related
pathway in ovarian cancer cells

Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of cancer
death from gynecologic tumors [18]. It is warranted
to develop and test new therapeutic agents due to the
high mortality rate. In this research, two ovarian cancer
cell lines, SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells, were chosen to
investigate the anti-tumor activity of MIL in ovarian
cancer cells. MTT assay showed that MIL dosedependently inhibited the proliferation of both SK-OV-3
and A2780S with IC50 values of 4 µM after 48 h treatment
(Figure 1A).
To further verify the inhibitory effect of MIL on
tumor growth in vivo, we examined the anti-tumor effect
of MIL on the growth of ovarian cancer cells in nude mice.
MIL was administered i.v. at 20 mg/kg every two days in a
volume of 200 µL, made up in 0.9% saline with a few drops
Tween 80 (2.5%) and ethanol (2.5%). At the end of the
experiment, MIL treatment group significantly inhibited
the tumor growth in both SK-OV-3 (Figure  1B and 1D)
and A2780S xenograft models (Figure 1C, 1D) with
the inhibitory rate of 80.31% and 75.79%, respectively

Since NF-κB played an important role in cell
apoptosis [19], we investigated the effect of MIL on NF-κB
pathway. Interestingly, we found that MIL activated NF-κB
pathway in SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells. MIL did not only
increase the expression of NF-κB (p65) in cytoplasm
but also enhanced the expression of NF-κB (p65) in the
nucleus of both ovarian cancer cells (Figure 3A). Western
blot further showed that MIL also increased the levels of
IKKα, p-IKKα/β, p-IκBα and NF-κB (p65) protein, and
deceased the expression of IκBα protein (Figure 3B). To
investigate the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus
of both ovarian cancer cells, EMSA assay was used to
determine the effect of MIL on the activity of NF-κB
DNA-binding. As depicted in Figure 3C, MIL indeed
enhanced NF-κB DNA-binding activity in both ovarian
cancer cells. These data revealed that MIL significantly
activated NF-κB in SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells. In
consistent to in vitro results, immunohistochemistry

expression of NF-κB (p65) protein in MIL-treated tumor
tissue (Figure 3D).

of NF-κB (p65) in both SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells. MIL
significantly increased the expression of NF-κB (p65) in
cytoplasm and nucleus and MIL combined with NF-κB
inhibitors did not only decrease the effect to up-regulate
the expression of NF-κB of MIL (Figure 4C), but also
reduced the effect to inhibit tumor cells proliferation of
MIL . MTT results showed the NF-κB signaling blockade
could alleviate the anti-proliferative effect of MIL on two
ovarian cancer cells (Figure   4D). These data suggested
that activation of NF-κB showed a pro-apoptotic function
in MIL-treated SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells.

Activated-NF-κB showed a pro-apoptotic
function in two ovarian cancer cells
Normally, NF-κB regulates apoptosis through
regulating the expression of target genes, such as
increasing the expression of Bcl-2 and inhibiting
cytochrome C releasing from mitochondria to inhibit
apoptosis [20]. However, our results revealed that MIL
decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl and increased
the level of Bax (Figure 4A), enhanced the release of
cytochrome C from mitochondria into cytoplasm in both
MIL-induced apoptotic cells (Figure 4B), exhibiting
obvious characteristics of apoptosis. To further clarify
whether NF-κB contributes to MIL-induced apoptosis,
specific NF-κB inhibitors (JSH23, SC75741 and Caffeic
Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE)) were used to investigate
MIL’s effect on SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells by by
immunofluorescence and MTT [21–23]. JSH23, SC75741
and CAPE at 5 µM concentration inhibited the expression

MIL induced DNA damage in ovarian cancer
cells
Previous studies reported that NF-κB could be
activated by double strand breaks and showed a proapoptotic function in the DNA damage response [24, 25].
Our previous study indicated that MIL induced DNA
damage in human hepatocarcinoma cancer cells [17].
To measure whether MIL induced DNA damage in
human ovarian cancer cells, we analyzed the DNA
damage in both MIL-treated ovarian cancer cells using

groups. (D) The bar charts of tumor weight. Columns, means; bars, SD (n = 6). ***P < 0.001, significantly different compared with control

SCGE assay. Figure  5A showed MIL (4 μM) caused
DNA strand breaks in both SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells
within 24 and 36 h treatment (90% of cells showed the
comet image, P < 0.01). Mild DNA damage normally
leads to cell cycle arrest. ATM, as the main downregulator of DNA damage could arrest the cell cycle by
phosphorylation and activation of cell cycle checkpoint
[26]. Since extreme DNA damage is hard to repair, the
DNA damage insult is transmitted by the cellular stress
response to activation of effectors systems to mediate cell
death [27]. After treatment of MIL for 24 and 48 h, MIL
induced cells G2/M arrest (Supplementary Figure S1) and
apoptosis (Figure  2), respectively and MIL significantly

increased the level of p-ATM protein in SK-OV-3 and
A2780S cells (Figure 5B). Phosphorylated ATM could
further phosphorylate IKK to activate NF-κB following
DNA damage [28]. Western blot showed that MIL
increased the levels p-IKKα/β and NF-κB (p65) protein
with MIL-treatment for 24 h in ovarian cancer cells
(Figure 5C). We further investigated the effect of ATM
on the activation of NF-κB in MIL-treated SK-OV-3 and
A2780S cells in the presence of specific ATM inhibitor
(KU55933) [29]. KU55933 could neutralize the effect
of MIL to both p-ATM and NF-κB (p65) in some extent
in SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells (Figure 5D). The results
of immunofluorescence assay proved that KU55933

significantly reduced the expression of NF-κB (p65) in
MIL-induced cells (Figure 5E) and MTT assay showed
that KU55933 could alleviate MIL-induced apoptosis
(Supplementary Figure S2). Thus, above results suggested
that the activation of NF-κB was in response to DNA
damage and it played an important part in MIL-induced
cell apoptosis in human ovarian cells [25, 30].

topoisomerase II [13]. If cells undergo DSB, DNA damage
would phosphorylate H2AX at Ser139 (γ-H2AX) [31].
Thus, γ-H2AX was thought to be a marker of DSB. The
results of both western blot and immunofluorescence
showed MIL increased the level of γ-H2AX protein
(Figure 6A, 6B), suggesting that MIL might induce DSB
via inhibiting topoisomerase II.
Then, we detected the inhibitory effect of MIL on
topoisomerase II using topoisomerase II drug screening
kit. As shown in Figure 6C, etoposide (VP-16), a
topoisomerase II inhibitor, induced the production of linear
DNA and caused DNA damage at 0.1 mM concentration
(Figure 6C Lane 5). MIL inhibited the activity of
topoisomerase II and induced the production of linear

DNA damage
Normally, DNA damage is divided into DNA single
strand breaks (SSB) through inhibiting topoisomerase
I and DNA double strand breaks (DSB) via inhibiting

DNA in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 6C
Lane 3 and 4), suggesting that MIL targeted topoisomerase
II, which had a similar mechanism to VP-16 (Figure 6C).
Compounds that target topoisomerse II are split
into two main classes: topoisomerase poisons, targeting
the topoisomerase-DNA complex, and topoisomerase
inhibitors, disrupting catalytic turnover. [32, 33]. Then,
we investigated how MIL interfered with topoisomerse II
using computer modeling. The binding mode suggested
that MIL interacted with the DNA cleavage parallel
to the axis of DNA base pairing in the same style with
the known topo II-DNA inhibitors, stabilized by base-

stacking π-π interactions between aromatic rings with
both upstream and downstream base pairs. MIL could
form π-π interactions with DG-12 and DG-13. Moreover,
the oxygen of 2H-benzopyran formed H-bonds with the
amine of DC-8.

MIL inhibited proliferation of drug-resistant
ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo
As drug resistance is a big problem to successful
chemotherapy for ovarian cancer [34], we chose PACresistant A2780T cells to investigate inhibition effect of

MIL on the proliferation of drug-resistant ovarian in vitro
and in vivo. As depicted in Figure 7A, MIL showed similar
proliferation inhibition in PAC-resistant A2780T cells as
in A2780S cells, suggesting MIL might show activity
in anti-cancer drug resistance. Then we investigated the
tumor growth inhibition activity of MIL in the PACresistant A2780T cells xenograft model. MIL also showed
remarkable reduction of tumor volume and weight in drugresistant cells in nude mice (Figure 7B, Supplementary
Table S1). The average tumor weights of MIL-treated
group was 1.46 ± 0.06 g (P < 0.001), compared the control
group of 3.52 ± 0.30 g and PAC group of 2.51 ± 0.25 g.
The inhibitory rate of MIL was 58.48%, higher than PAC
of 29.03%.
Meanwhile, MIL also induced apoptosis in MILtreated tumors (Figure 7C) and in PAC-resistant A2780T
cells (Figure 7D, 7E). The results of immunofluorescence
assay showed that MIL increased the expression of NFκB (p65) subunit protein in the nucleus, although NF-κB

(p65) protein kept a comparatively high level in cytoplasm
of PAC-resistant A2780T cells (Figure 7F).

DISCUSSION
Ovarian cancer is one of the most deadly
gynecologic malignancies worldwide and ranks among
top five deadliest cancers in most countries [18, 35].
Although chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin
and paclitaxel (PAC), are widely used for the treatment
of ovarian cancer, chemo-resistance remains a major
therapeutic problem [34, 36]. Hence, it is a critical issue to
develop more efficient compounds for improving ovarian
cancer chemotherapy treatment. In this paper, MIL showed
significant anti-tumor activity in human ovarian cancer,
with the inhibitory rate of 80.31% and 75.79% in the SKOV-3 and A2780S cells xenograft models (Figure 1B, 1C)
and 58.48% in PAC-resistant A2780T xenograft model
(Figure 7B) (Supplementary Table S1). The significant

anti-tumor activity suggested that MIL might be a potential
lead compound for cancer drug candidate.
When we studied the underlying mechanism
of the anti-tumor activity of MIL in ovarian cancer
cells, it was found that MIL activated NF-κB pathway
in apoptotic ovarian cancer cells and further research
revealed that MIL did not only increase the level of NFκB (p65) protein (Figure 3A, 3B), but also enhanced
NF-κB DNA binding activity (Figure 3C). Specific NFκB inhibitors (JSH-23, SC75741 and CAPE [21–23])
deceased the expression of NF-κB (p65) (Figure 4C)
and alleviated the effect of MIL-induced apoptosis
(Figure 4D) implying that NF-κB activation induced
by MIL exhibited a pro-apoptotic function in SK-OV-3
and A2780S cells. Several recent studies reported that
NF-κB showed a pro-apoptotic function in response to
DNA damage induced by chemotherapeutic agents [24,
25]. When cells undergo DNA damage, ATM and ATR
were activated in response to DNA damage [37–39], and
ATM was primarily activated by auto-phosphorylation on
Ser1981 in response to double strand breaks induced by
chemotherapeutic drugs [25, 40]. If the DNA damage was
too severe to repair, it was transmitted by cellular stress
response to mediate cell death [25, 27, 41]. The activated
ATM would phosphorylate IKK to activate NF-κB which
resulted in a significant increase in DNA damage prior
to the induction of apoptosis [42]. The results of SCGE

assay revealed that MIL induced significant DNA damage
(Figure 5A) and G2/M arrest (Supplementary Figure S1)
at 24 h in SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells. MIL increased the
level of p-ATM and p-IKK protein in both human ovarian
cancer cells. Activated-IKK phosphorylated IκB could
separate from NF-κB complex and activated NF-κB.
And the results showed that MIL increased the level of
activated NF-κB (p65) (Figure 5C). KU55933, an inhibitor
of ATM [29], could reduce the effect of MIL to decrease
the expression of p-ATM and NF-κB (p65) (Figure  5D).
In SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells, MIL caused DNA damage
to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through activating
ATM. The phosphroylated ATM further activated NF-κB
and finally contributed to apoptosis. The results that
KU55933 could alleviate MIL-induced apoptosis
(Supplementary Figure S2) suggested MIL showed antitumor activity through inducing DNA damage.
DNA damage is generally divided into single strand
breaks (SSB) and double strand breaks (DSB) [13]. If cells
undergo DSB, DNA damage would phosphorylate H2AX at
Ser139 (γ-H2AX) to repair DNA [30]. γ-H2AX is used as a
biomarker of cellular response to DSB. We proved that MIL
increased the expression of γ-H2AX in both SK-OV-3 and
A2780S cells using western blot and immmunoflurescence
assay (Figure 6A and 6B). Usually, small molecules inducing
DNA DSB were through targeting type II topoisomerase
[43]. Then, topoisomerase II drug screening kit was used to

test the inhibitory activity of MIL on topoisomerase II. MIL
induced a significant production of linear DNA revealing
MIL might target topoisomerase II to cause DNA damage
as VP16 did (Figure 6C). And VP16 could also inhibit the
proliferation of SK-OV-3 and A2780S and activated p-ATM
and NF-κB (p65) as MIL did (Supplementary Figure S3)
Small molecules targeting topoisomerase II are divided
into two forms: 1) inhibitors of topoisomerase II, which
can inhibit the ATPase activity by acting as noncompetitive

inhibitors of ATP, such as HU-331, ICRF-187, ICRF193, and mitindomide; 2) poisons of topoisomerase
II, which can target the DNA-protein complex, such
as etoposide, novobiocin, quinolones and teniposide
[32, 33, 44]. Results of computer modeling demonstrated
that MIL could bind with Topo II-Cleaved DNA complex
to stabilize the complex (Figure 6D, 6E). Thus, our data
indicated MIL inhibited the activity of topoisomerase II by
acting as a topoisomerase II poison.

Flow cytometry

In conclusion, MIL induced human ovarian cancer
cells DNA damage through targeting the topoisomeraseDNA complex. The un-repairable DNA damage caused
by the continuing role of MIL induced cell apoptosis to
inhibit the tumor growth of human ovarian cancer cells in
vitro and in vivo. And MIL-activated NF-κB showed a proapoptotic function in response to DNA damage.

After treated with different concentration MIL
for 48 h, cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC and
propidium iodide (PI). Apoptotic cells were measured on
a flow cytometer (CytoFlex, Beckman Coulter, USA).

Caspases activity assays

MATERIALS AND METHODS

To measure caspases activity, Caspases-like protease
activity in SK-OV-3 and A2780S cells was analyzed using
a colorimetric test system. After treating with 4 μM MIL
for 36 h, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (Biyotime,
China) on ice. Cytosolic protein was mixed with 10 μL
caspases-specific substrate (2 mM) for 2 h at 37ºC. The
value of absorbance of sample was monitored at 405 nm
using a Spectramax M5 Microtiter Plate Luminometer.

Cell culture and chemicals
The human ovarian cancer cell lines, SK-OV-3 and
A2780S, and PAC-resistant A2780T were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA). Cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 U/ml penicillin and
streptomycin.
MTT, DMSO, Hoechst 33258, PAC and anti-βactin, Bad and Bcl-2 were purchased from Sigma (St
Louis, MO, USA). JSH-23 (S7351), SC75741 (S7273),
CAPE (S7414) and KU55933 (S1092) were bought
from Selleckchem (USA). Antibodies against Bax,
ATM, p-ATM, IKKα, p-IKKα/β, IκBα, p-IκBα, NF-κB
(p65), H2AX and γ-H2AX were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (CST, Danvers, MA). Antibody
against Bcl-xl was bought form Abcam (UK). MIL was
isolated from Millettia pachycarpa Benth. The Sample in
all experiments contained MIL of 99% or higher purity,
which was dissolved in DMSO to produce a 10 mM stock
solution and stored at 4ºC. In the in vivo experiments, MIL
was dissolved in sodium chloride injection containing
2.5% Tween-80 and 2.5% ethanol in a volume of 200 μL.

Immunofluorescence imaging
Cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated glass
coverslips and treated with 4 μM MIL and fixed with
4% formaldehyde polymer for 10 min and subsequently
incubated with primary antibodies overnight. The Alexafluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated
for one hour at room temperature. The nucleus stained
with Hoechst 33258. The images were detected using an
inverted fluorescence microscopy.

Western blot
After being treated with various concentrations
of MIL, cells were lyed in cell lysis buffer (Biyotime,
China) on ice. The protein concentration was determined
by Bio-Rad DC protein Assay and 30 μg of each sample
was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The primary
antibodies incubated overnight. The secondary antibodies
incubated 1 h. Proteins were visualized with enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL, Millipore, USA).

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in 96 well plates and cultured
overnight. The cells were treated with different
concentration of MIL for 48 h. Cell viability was
determined by MTT assay [45]. The absorbance at 570 nm
was determined in each well with the Spectramax M5
Microtiter Plate Luminometer (Molecular Devices, USA).

Electromobility shift assay (EMSA)
A specific probe for DNA-protein interaction
analysis was used, containing a NF-κB binding element.
The following oligonucleotides were used: NF-κB sense,
5-AGCTTCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGG-3
and
NF-κB antisense, 5-TCGACCTCTCGGAAAGTCCCCT
CTGA-3. Nuclear extracts and EMSA experiments were
performed as the instructions for the Chemiluminescent
Nuclei Acid Detection Module (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, PA).

In vivo tumor xenograft
To determine the in vivo anti-tumor activity of MIL,
cells (5 × 106 in 100 μL saline) were injected s.c. into the
right flanks of female nude mice (6 weeks old, BALB/cAnu (nu/nu)). After 2 weeks, the tumors were aseptically
dissected and pieces of tumor tissue (2–3 mm3 in size)
were transplanted s.c. by a trocar into mice. When the
tumor size reached 100 mm3, mice were randomly divided
into groups (n = 6) and treated with PAC and MIL every
two days. Tumor burden was measured every two days or
three days with a caliper (calculated volume (mm3) = π/6
× length × width × width).

analyzed by SCGE (comet assay) as described by Fairbairn
et al. [46]. Cells were embedded in 75 μL 0.5% low-melting
point agarose, and microscope slides were immersed in icecold lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 nM Tris,
1% sodium laurylsarcosine (pH 10), 1% Triton X-100 and
10% DMSO) for 80 min. Then the slides were exposed
to alkali (300 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA (pH > 13))
for 40 min. After electrophoresis (25 V, 300 mA, 15 min),
the slides were neutralized in 0.4 M Tris buffer (pH 7.5).
The ethidium bromide-stained slides were analyzed using
image analysis system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

We detected the inhibition function of MIL on
topoisomerase II using a topoisomerase II drug screening
kit (TopoGEN, USA). Briefly, 1 μL supercoiled DNA was
suspended in a reaction buffer. Different concentration
of MIL was added to the mixture before the reaction was
started by topoisomerase II enzyme addition. The mixture
was incubated at 37ºC for 30 min, and the reaction was
stopped by adding 1 μL 10% SDS. The topoisomerase
II enzyme in the mixture was digested by proteinase K
(50 μg/mL) at 37ºC for 15 min. The DNA samples were
cleaned by extracting with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol
(24:1, v/v) treatment and analyzed by 1% agarose gel
containing 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide electrophoresis.

In order to investigate the binding interactions
between topoisomerase II and MIL (PDB ID: 3QX3)
[11], the crystal structure of human topoisomerase II in
complex with DNA and etoposide was employed as the
docking template. The preparation of complex structure
and ligand, molecular docking were accomplished by
Discovery Studio 3.1, and the docking results were
analyzed by PyMol 1.5. The active site for MIL docking
was constituted by the topo II-DNA within 7.5 Å around
the etoposide. The best pose was picked out by the docking
score and the rationality of molecular conformation.

Tumors and tissues were fixed in 4% neutral
buffered formalin solution for more than 24 h and
embedded in paraffin. Sections 3–5 μm of the tissues were
used to measure the effect of MIL on inducing apoptosis
using TUNEL assay (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit,
Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The effect of MIL on NFκB (p65) would be measured using NF-κB (p65) (Mouse,
Santa Cruz, sc8008) staining.
