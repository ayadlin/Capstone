Abstract
The therapeutic efﬁcacy of anthracyclines relies, at least partially, on the induction of a dendritic cell– and
T-lymphocyte–dependent anticancer immune response. Here, we show that anthracycline-based chemotherapy
promotes the recruitment of functional CD11bþCD11cþLy6ChighLy6GMHCIIþ dendritic cell–like antigenpresenting cells (APC) into the tumor bed, but not into lymphoid organs. Accordingly, draining lymph nodes
turned out to be dispensable for the proliferation of tumor antigen–speciﬁc T cells within neoplastic lesions as
induced by anthracyclines. In addition, we found that tumors treated with anthracyclines manifest increased
expression levels of the chemokine Ccl2. Such a response is important as neoplasms growing in Ccl2/ mice
failed to accumulate dendritic cell–like APCs in response to chemotherapy. Moreover, cancers developing in mice
lacking Ccl2 or its receptor (Ccr2) exhibited suboptimal therapeutic responses to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Altogether, our results underscore the importance of the CCL2/CCR2 signaling axis for therapeutic
anticancer immune responses as elicited by immunogenic chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 74(2); 436–45. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Accumulating evidence indicates that the antineoplastic
effects of anthracyclines largely depend on the induction of
a T-cell–mediated tumor-speciﬁc immune response. In
patients with breast cancer subjected to one cycle of anthracycline-based chemotherapy, a high ratio of CD8þ cytotoxic
versus FOXP3þ regulatory T cells within the tumor predicts the

advent of a complete pathological response after 6 cycles of
neoadjuvant treatment (1, 2). In mice, the therapeutic efﬁcacy
of anthracyclines is abolished when the extravasation of
CD11bþ myeloid cells is blocked (3), when several distinct
T-cell subsets (i.e., a/b or g/d T cells, CD8þ cells) are eliminated
(4, 5) as well as when essential cytokines such as interferon
(IFN)-g, interleukin (IL)-1b, and IL-17 are neutralized (5–7).
Thus, the therapeutic efﬁcacy of anthracyclines requires speciﬁc cytokines to orchestrate a complex immune response that
involves antigen-presenting cells (APC) exhibiting a dendritic
cell–like (i.e., CD11bþCD11cþLy6ChighLy6GMHCIIþ) phenotype and several T-cell subsets (3, 6). The actual source of such
intratumoral APCs has not yet been elucidated.
One of the most critical processes for the initiation of an
immune response against cancer cells succumbing to anthracyclines is the secretion of ATP (8). Extracellular ATP indeed
operates not only as a potent chemotactic signal (by binding to
purinergic P2Y2 receptors; ref. 9), but also as a proinﬂammatory agent, stimulating the activation of the NLRP3 inﬂammasome (by binding to purinergic P2RX7 receptors) and hence the
release of IL-1b (10). In line with this notion, ATP is essential
for the accumulation of monocytic precursors within the
tumor bed as well as for their local differentiation into dendritic cell–like APCs (3). Thus, shortly (24–72 hours) after the
administration of immunogenic chemotherapy (11–13), ATP
levels increase in the tumor interstitium as a consequence of
the apoptotic demise of cancer cells. Of note, autophagy is
required for such an immunogenic cell death–associated
release of ATP to be optimal (8). Myeloid and lymphoid cells
indeed are not recruited by anthracycline-treated autophagydeﬁcient tumors, correlating with the absence of anticancer

immune responses and hence with therapeutic failure (8).
Along similar lines, cancers can be rendered virtually insensitive to the antineoplastic effects of anthracyclines by the
overexpression of CD39, a cell surface ATP-degrading enzyme
(8). Besides ATP, other chemotactic factors including multiple
chemokines are known to participate into the recruitment of
innate and cognate immune effectors to inﬂammation sites
(14). However, the precise contribution of chemokines to
anticancer immune responses elicited by immunogenic chemotherapeutics has not yet been established.
Driven by these premises and incognita, we investigated
whether the APCs that accumulate within neoplastic lesions in
response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy derive from
local precursors or are recruited from external sources and to
which extent chemokines regulate their biogenesis. We found
that dendritic cell–like APCs are freshly recruited into the
tumor bed in response to immunogenic chemotherapy and
that the host-derived chemokine Ccl2 plays a major, ATPindependent role in this process. In line with this notion, Ccl2
and its major receptor, Ccr2 (also known as CD192), turned out
to be fundamental for the antineoplastic effects of anthracycline-based chemotherapy in mice.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Mouse ﬁbrosarcoma MCA205 cells (H2b), their ovalbumin
(OVA)-expressing derivatives (a generous gift from Dr. A.D.
Weinberg, Portland Providence Medical Centre, Portland, OR),
and AT3 mammary carcinoma cells (H2b) were cultured in
GlutaMAX-I–containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate,
10 mmol/L HEPES buffer, 1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids,
100 units/mL penicillin G sodium, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate. Unless otherwise indicated, authenticated wildtype cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, immediately ampliﬁed to constitute liquid nitrogen
stocks and (upon thawing) never passaged for more than 1
month before use in experimental determinations. Cell culture
products were from Gibco-Life Technologies.
Animal experiments
Mice were housed in speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions at
either the Institut Gustave Roussy (IGR, Villejuif, France), the
Peter MacCallum Cancer Center (East Melbourne, Australia),
or the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute (Herston,
Australia). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Federation of European Laboratory Animal
Science Association guidelines and were approved either by
the IGR Ethics Committee (CEEA IRCIV/IGR No. 26, registered
with the French Ministry of Research) or by the Animal
Experimentation Ethics Committee of Peter MacCallum Cancer Center and QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute.
Female C57BL/6 (H2b) mice (aged between 6 and 8 weeks) were
purchased from Janvier, OVA257–264-speciﬁc T-cell receptor
(TCR) transgenic OT1 mice (H2b) and congenic mice harboring
an alternative CD45/Ly-5 alloantigen (Ly-5.1) were obtained
from Charles River, whereas Ccl2/ and Ccr2/ mice were
bred at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center or QIMR Berghofer

www.aacrjournals.org

Medical Research Institute. Mice were maintained under controlled light cycle (12 hours lights ON, 12 hours lights OFF),
allowed food and water ad libitum, and were invariably used for
experiments between the age of 7 and 16 weeks.
Lymphadenectomy
Mice were subjected to skin decontamination with 10%
povidone–iodine (commercial Betadine solution) and anesthesia was maintained by continuous mask inhalation of
isoﬂurane ﬂow during surgery. A narrow incision (3 mm) was
performed on the thigh, tumor-draining lymph nodes (DLN)
were removed using a dissecting forceps, and the incision was
eventually closed with sterile skin closure clips. Sham-operated
mice were treated with a similar procedure (but were not
subjected to lymphadenectomy), and the duration of surgery
was standardized between the 2 groups. After surgery, mice
were placed on a heater plate set at 37 C until recovery.
Tumor chemotherapy models
For establishing syngeneic solid tumors, wild-type, Ccl2/,
or Ccr2/ CB57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 5  105
MCA205, OVA-expressing MCA205, or AT3 cells subcutaneously. Thereafter, tumor surface (longest diameter multiplied
by its perpendicular diameter) was routinely monitored by
means of a common caliper, and when it reached 25 to 45 mm2,
mice received either 2.9 mg/kg doxorubicin intratumorally
(i.t.; in 50 mL PBS) or an equivalent volume of solvent.
Transplantation of established tumors
CD45.2 CB57BL/6 mice were anesthetized under continuous
isoﬂurane ﬂow and a small incision was made on the skin near
the thigh. MCA205 ﬁbrosarcomas (surface ¼ 35–50 mm2)
freshly harvested from CD45.1 mice were then implanted as a
whole subcutaneously, with the help of grooved probes and
forceps. Eventually, the incision was closed with sterile skin
closure clips.
Tissue recovery and processing for ﬂow cytometry
Freshly recovered tumors or spleens were cut into small
pieces (using surgical scissors) in digestion buffer (serum-free
GlutaMAX-I–containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 0.4 W€
unsch units/mL Liberase TL, from Roche, and
200 U/mL DNase I, from Calbiochem), and then transferred
to 24-well plates for enzymatic dissociation (30 minutes, 37  C).
Upon washing with PBS, single-cell suspensions were obtained
by ﬁltering samples through a 70-mm cell strainer. Lymph
nodes were gently squeezed with dissecting forceps in digestion buffer to obtain single-cell suspensions. Bone marrow cells
were recovered by repeatedly ﬂushing the femoral or tibial
bone marrow cavities with PBS using 26G needles. The peripheral blood was harvested from the inner canthus of the eye with
heparin-coated Pasteur pipettes. Red blood cells were removed
with the RBC Lysis Buffer (BioLegend), following the manufacturer's instructions.
Flow cytometry and sorting
For cell surface immunostaining, primary antibodies targeting the following proteins were used (at 2 mg/mL unless

BioLegend; Ly-6B.2 (7/4), from AbD Serotec; and CCR2 (MC21), a generous gift from Dr. Matthias Mack (University of
Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany). Cytoﬂuorometric assessments were performed on a BD LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD
Biosciences) and data were analyzed by means of the FlowJo
software package (Tree Star, Inc.). Tumor cell suspensions
were sorted with a MoFlo XDP (Beckman-Coulter) or a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) cell sorter.
In situ T-cell activation assays
For testing antigen-speciﬁc T-cell proliferation in situ, splenic OT1 cells were stained with 5 mmol/L CFSE (Molecular
Probes-Life Technologies) for 10 minutes at 37 C, followed by
quenching of the extra dye with an equal volume of 20% FBS in
PBS. These cells were then inoculated intravenously into OVAexpressing MCA205 ﬁbrosarcoma-bearing mice (7  106 cells/
mouse), 4 days after tumor cell inoculation (day-5). Chemotherapy was administered on day 0 and mice were subjected to
lymphadenectomy or sham surgery on day 1. OT1 cell proliferation in tumors and DLNs was assessed by CFSE dilution on
day 3.
Alternatively, CD45.2þ OT1 cells were inoculated intravenously into CD45.1 congenic mice (1  106 cells/mouse) 1 day
before the subcutaneous inoculation of OVA-expressing
MCA205 cells. Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy or PBS was
administered i.t. 7 days later. Tumors, DLNs, contralateral
lymph nodes, and spleens were harvested 60 hours after
chemotherapy to analyze CD69 expression on OT1 cells.
Microarray studies
Total RNA was isolated from established MCA205 ﬁbrosarcomas 2 and 7 days after the i.t. administration of doxorubicin
or PBS. Biotin-labeled cRNA was synthesized using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Ampliﬁcation Kit (Applied Biosystems).
cRNA was hybridized to Mouse WG-6 V.2 Expression BeadChips (Illumina) and scanned with a BeadStation 500 (Illumina). Raw data collection from Illumina BeadChips was
performed using the BeadStudio software v. 3.1.1.0 (Illumina).
Data were further analyzed by on an R-based informatics
platform by means of packages from the Bioconductor project
(15). Upon quantile normalization, genes were deﬁned as
differentially expressed when associated with absolute
changes in expression levels (absolute fold change) >1.7. This
transcriptomic dataset has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number GSE46275; ref. 16).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA extraction and genomic DNA removal were
performed by means of the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (0.5–2 mg
per sample) was then reverse transcribed into cDNA with
the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies),
in the presence of random primers, the RNasin Plus RNase

Inhibitor (Promega) and the Deoxynucleoside Triphosphate
Set, PCR grade (Roche). The expression of genes coding for
inﬂammatory cytokines, chemokines, M1 or M2 macrophagerelated factors, and protein involved in MHC class I or class II
antigen presentation was analyzed with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays using the Universal Master Mix II (with UNG) on a
StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (everything from Applied
Biosystems). Quantitative RT-PCR data were invariably normalized to the expression levels of the housekeeping gene
peptidylprolyl isomerase A (Ppia).
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
Freshly harvested tumors were processed for the immunoﬂuorescence microscopy–assisted quantiﬁcation of caspase-3 activation and inﬁltration by CD11cþCD86þ cells as
previously reported (3). Thereafter, 5-mm-thick cryosections
were stained with the following antibodies or antibody
conjugates: CD11c-AlexaFluor 488 (N418, from eBioscience),
CD86-AlexaFluor 647 (GL-1, from BioLegend), and anticleaved caspase-3 (Asp175, from Cell Signaling Technology),
followed by AlexaFluor 568 goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin
G (HþL; from Molecular Probes-Life Technologies). Nuclear
counterstaining was achieved by incubating slides in 10
mmol/L Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes-Life Technologies) for 5 minutes before mounting. Finally, 20 to 40
view-ﬁelds were acquired for each slide by means of a
confocal SPE microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH), and
8 to 10 images were randomly picked for statistical analysis.
Statistical analyses
Unless otherwise indicated, results are expressed as means
 SEM or means  SD, as appropriate, of n ¼ 3 parallel
assessments. All experiments were repeated at least twice,
yielding similar results. Normal distributions were compared
by unpaired, 2-tailed Student t tests; tumor growth curves with
Mann–Whitney U tests. Statistical analyses were performed
with Prism 5 (GraphPad) or Excel 2007 (Microsoft). P-values <
0.05 were considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

Results and Discussion
Chemotherapy stimulates intratumoral antigen
presentation
Shortly (38 hours) after the i.t. administration of doxorubicin, a prototypical anthracycline, MCA205 ﬁbrosarcomas
established in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice contain an
elevated percentage of CD11bþLy6ChighLy6G and CD11cþ
MHCIIþ cells, as compared with vehicle-injected lesions
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 3). Besides becoming
more abundant with time, this subset of myeloid cells overexpresses genes involved in MHC class I– and II–restricted
antigen presentation (Fig. 1B and C), as well as genes coding for
multiple cytokines, including IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-10, and IL-12
(Fig. 1D). However, these cells do not manifest an obvious
polarization of gene expression toward a proﬁle associated
with M1 or M2 macrophages (Supplementary Fig. S2). At this
time point, no increase in CD11bþLy6ChighLy6G, CD11bþ,
CD11bþLy6ChighLy6G, and CD11bþLy6Gþ cells was
observed in the DLNs of mice bearing doxorubicin-treated

Supplementary Fig. S3). Sixty hours after the administration of
doxorubicin, the percentage of activated (CD69þ) OVA-speciﬁc OT1 cells was increased in the tumor bed, but not in the
spleen, DLNs, and contralateral lymph node (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Of note, the chemotherapy-induced proliferation of
i.t. OT1 cells was maintained upon the surgical ablation of
DLNs (Fig. 1E). This is in line with previous ﬁndings from our
group demonstrating that anticancer immune responses elicited by doxorubicin-based chemotherapy are insensitive to
the administration of a lymphotoxin b decoy that impedes the
formation of DLNs (3). Moreover, the proliferation of adoptively transferred CFSE-labeled OT1 cells in DLNs was not
affected by chemotherapy (Supplementary Fig. S4). Taken
together, these ﬁndings indicate that the presentation of tumor
antigens elicited by immunogenic chemotherapy occurs within the tumor bed.
Intratumoral recruitment of APCs upon immunogenic
chemotherapy
Theoretically, the APCs that accumulate within anthracycline-treated neoplastic lesions might either originate from
preexisting precursors that differentiate locally or be recruited
de novo from external sources. To discriminate between these
possibilities, we established MCA205 ﬁbrosarcomas in CD45.1
mice, treated them with vehicle or doxorubicin, and (1 day
later) transplanted them into isogenic CD45.2 C57BL/6 recipients. This allowed us to quantify the intratumoral abundance
of sessile (CD45.1þ) versus freshly recruited (CD45.2þ) leukocytes, more speciﬁcally CD11cþMHCIIþ cells. In this setting,
we observed that most tumor-sessile leukocytes are replaced
by their recipient-derived counterparts within the ﬁrst 4 days
after transplantation, irrespective of the administration of
vehicle or doxorubicin (Fig. 2A–C). Globally, the ratio of
recipient-derived (CD45.2þ) versus donor-derived (CD45.1þ)
cells was not altered by chemotherapy (Fig. 2E). However, in
doxorubicin-treated tumors, the ratio of CD45.2þ versus
CD45.1þ CD11cþMHCIIþ dendritic cell–like cells was higher
than in PBS-receiving lesions (Fig. 2E), supporting the notion
that anthracyclines trigger the recruitment of dendritic cell
precursors rather than the mere differentiation of preexisting
myeloid cells in situ. Accordingly, CD11bþLy6ChighLy6G cells
accumulating within neoplastic lesions in response to anthracyclines phenotypically resembled a cell subset present in the
bone marrow (both were also CD11cþF4/80int7/4þCD103þ;
Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, the frequency of several
distinct circulating CD11bþ cell subsets ﬂuctuated in response
to anthracyclines (Supplementary Fig. S5), in concert with the
possibility that at least a fraction of CD11bþLy6ChighLy6G
cells found in the tumor bed upon immunogenic chemotherapy is blood-borne.
Ccl2 is required for the intratumoral recruitment of
APCs
ATP is known to operate as a chemotactic and danger
signal in the context of immunogenic chemotherapy (3, 8). In
line with this notion, MCA205 ﬁbrosarcoma cells that had
been engineered to overexpress the ecto-ATPase CD39 on
their surface generated lesions in immunocompetent mice

440

that were unable to recruit myeloid, especially CD11bþ
Ly6ChighLy6G cells in response to doxorubicin (Fig. 3A).
To identify additional factors that are involved in the chemotherapy-induced recruitment of antigen-presenting leukocytes into the tumor bed, we performed microarray-based
transcriptomic analyses. In this setting, several chemokineencoding genes were found to be upregulated (at the mRNA
level) 2 days after the i.t. administration of doxorubicin
(Fig. 3B). In particular, anthracycline-based chemotherapy
turned out to promote the expression of Ccl2 and Ccl7 (two
chemokines involved in myeloid cell chemotaxis; refs. 17
and 18) by intratumoral CD11bþLy6ChighLy6G cells. This
phenomenon was not inﬂuenced by CD39 and hence must
be independent from the immunogenic cell death–associated secretion of ATP (Fig. 3C). The levels of Cx3cl1 in
CD11bþLy6ChighLy6G cells were not inﬂuenced by anthracycline-based chemotherapy, yet were a priori more elevated
in the context of CD39 overexpression (Supplementary Fig.
S6). Conversely, extracellular ATP seemed to have a positive
impact on the expression levels of Cxcl1, Cxcl9, Cxcl10,
Cxcl11, and Ccl5 (Fig. S6). Of note, both CD45þ leukocytes
and CD45 tumor cells responded to doxorubicin by producing Ccl2 and Ccl7, yet only the former did so in a
statistically signiﬁcant fashion (Fig. 3D). Moreover, tumors
growing in Ccl2/ mice failed to recruit CD11bþ
Ly6ChighLy6G cells in response to doxorubicin (Fig. 3E).
Interestingly, several CD11bþ cell subsets including CD11bþ
Ly6ChighLy6G leukocytes were found to express the Ccl2
receptor Ccr2 (which also binds Ccl7), irrespective of their
previous exposure to doxorubicin. In this context, the highest levels of Ccr2 were expressed by CD11bþ cells isolated
from neoplastic lesions (as opposed to the circulation,
spleen, bone marrow and DLNs; Fig. 3F). Conversely, we
failed to detect signiﬁcant amounts of Ccr2 on the surface
of malignant cells, be them recovered from PBS- or doxorubicin-treated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S7). Taken
together, these observations suggest that Ccl2 produced by
host leukocytes plays a prominent role in recruitment of
CD11bþLy6ChighLy6G cells into the tumor bed upon anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
The efﬁcacy of anthracycline-based chemotherapy in
mice depends on Ccl2/Ccr2
The aforementioned ﬁndings indicate that Ccl2 is required
for the doxorubicin-stimulated intratumoral accumulation of
CD11bþLy6ChighLy6G dendritic cell–like cells, including the
APCs that are essential for the optimal efﬁcacy of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (3). MCA205 ﬁbrosarcomas developing in Ccl2/ and Ccr2/ mice exhibited a similar apoptotic response to doxorubicin than tumors growing in wildtype hosts (Fig. 4A and B). However, the absence of Ccl2 or
Ccr2 in the host dampened the accumulation of CD11cþ
CD86þ dendritic cells in tumor areas enriched of dead cells
(Fig. 4A and C). In line with this notion, Ccl2/ and Ccr2/
mice bearing MCA205 ﬁbrosarcomas were less sensitive to
doxorubicin-based chemotherapy than their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 4D). Similarly, AT3 breast carcinomas only
responded to the i.t. administration of doxorubicin in mice

AT3 cancers in Ccl2/ or Ccr2/ hosts was poorly affected
by anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Fig. 4E). Altogether,
these data indicate that the CCL2/CCR2 signaling axis is
essential for optimal therapeutic responses to anthracyclines,
at least in mice.

Concluding remarks
Taken together, the results presented here indicate that
anthracycline-based chemotherapy promotes the intratumoral accumulation of (presumably blood-borne) myeloid
cells, including cells with a dendritic cell–like phenotype that
mediate antigen presentation. Immunogenic chemotherapy

of minimal lymphoid organ. Independently from the accumulation of ATP in the tumor microenvironment, anthracyclines
stimulated distinct types of tumor-associated cells, but mainly
CD45þ myeloid cells, to produce a series of chemokines
including the 2 Ccr2 ligands Ccl2 and Ccl7. Tumors established
in Ccl2/ hosts failed to recruit dendritic cell–like APCs and
exhibited a suboptimal therapeutic response to upon anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Along similar lines, tumor growing in Ccr2/ did not respond to anthracyclines as efﬁciently
as tumors implanted in Ccl2- and Ccr2-proﬁcient mice. These
ﬁndings support the importance of host-derived Ccl2 acting on
host Ccr2 for the anticancer immune response elicited by
immunogenic cell death.
The CCL2/CCR2 system has been previously implicated in
the accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages and
myeloid-derived suppressor cells within neoplastic lesions,
hence supporting tumor growth via proinﬂammatory and
immunosuppressive mechanisms (19). In addition, an autocrine CCL2-dependent signaling pathway has been suggested to promote the survival and mobility of cancer cells
(20), whereas tumor cell–derived CCL2 has been shown to
stimulate metastasis (21) and angiogenesis (22). In line with
these observations, CCL2- or CCR2-targeting agents have
been shown to improve the antineoplastic activity of distinct
immunotherapeutic regimens (23, 24) as well as the efﬁcacy
of gemcitabine- and cisplatin-based chemotherapy (25, 26).
Based on these observations, several clinical trials have
recently been launched to evaluate the safety and therapeutic potential of CCL2- or CCR2-blocking antibodies, either as
standalone therapeutic interventions or combined with
conventional chemotherapy, in patients with cancer (source
http://clinicaltrials.gov).
Here, we investigated the impact of the CCL2/CCR2 system
in a rather peculiar context. First, the growth of the tumor
models that we chose was unaffected by the absence or
presence of Ccl2 or Ccr2 in the host (Fig. 4), implying that
none of the aforementioned protumorigenic functions of
CCL2/CCR2 operate in this scenario. Second, we focused our
attention on the therapeutic immune response elicited by the
immunogenic cell death inducer doxorubicin. In this experimental setting, the negative impact of CCL2/CCR2 ablation on
the therapeutic activity of doxorubicin correlated with a
reduced intratumoral recruitment of dendritic cell–like APCs.
It should be noted that the CCL2/CCR2 system mediates the
accumulation of myeloid-derived dendritic cells during allergic
(27) and autoimmune inﬂammation (28), as well as at sites of
parasitic (29), fungal (30), and mycobacterial infection (31).
Thus, the inhibition of the CCL2/CCR2 signaling axis may blunt
a wide range of inﬂammatory and immune reactions, including

those required for the control of infectious pathogens and
(pre)malignant cells.
Based on these considerations, the use of CCL2- or CCR2blocking agents in patients with cancer must be carefully
considered on a personalized basis. This may indeed constitute
a therapeutic option to subvert CCL2-dependent metastatic
spread, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression. However,
blocking the CCL2/CCR2 system should be avoided in conditions in which the recruitment of dendritic cell–like APCs into
the tumor bed constitutes a limiting step for the elicitation of
therapeutic anticancer immune responses.
