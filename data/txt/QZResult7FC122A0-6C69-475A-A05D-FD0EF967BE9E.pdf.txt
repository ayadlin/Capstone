Abstract:

Mutations in DNMT3A encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A were recently described
in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. To assess their prognostic significance,
we determined the mutational status of DNMT3A exon 23 in 288 patients with AML
excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia, aged from 18 to 65 years and treated in
Toulouse University Hospital. A mutation was detected in 39 patients (13.5%).
All DNMT3A exon 23+ patients had intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Mutations
significantly correlated with a higher WBC count (p<0.001), NPM1 (p<0.001)
and FLT3-ITD mutations (p=0.027). DNMT3A mutations were conserved through
xenotransplantation in immunodeficient mice. No difference in outcome between
DNMT3A exon 23+ and DNMT3A exon 23- patients was found even if the results
were stratified by NPM1 or FLT3-ITD status. However, DNMT3A exon 23+ patients
had better median DFS (not reached vs 11.6 months, p=0.009) and OS (not reached
vs 14.3 months, p=0.005) as compared to DNMT3A exon 23- patients when treated
with idarubicin, whereas patients treated with daunorubicin had similar outcome
regardless the DNMT3A status. This study shows that DNMT3A mutations have no
impact on outcome but could be a predictive factor for response to idarubicin and
thus, could have a direct influence in the way AML patients should be managed.

in schemas that have little changed during the past 30
years, relapse rates are very high, resulting in a poor
outcome in most cases with 5-year overall survival

vary regarding the main prognostic factors including
age, performance status, cytogenetic and molecular
abnormalities. Indeed, the knowledge of molecular basis
of AML has considerably increased in the past few years
mostly through the identification of recurrent mutational
events occurring in a substantial number of patients [2].
The leukemic clone emerges from normal
hematopoietic stem cells or more mature myeloid
progenitors after acquisition of gene mutations affecting
cell differentiation and self-renewal (such as the fusion
genes PML-RARA, AML1-ETO, CBFb-MYH11 or point
mutations targeting the functions of CEBPA, RUNX1, MLL
or NPM1), cell signaling (FLT3, RAS or KIT), epigenetic
machinery (TET2) and cell metabolism (IDH1 or IDH2)
[3-4]. These mutations particularly occur in AML without
chromosomal abnormalities detected (normal karyotypes)
and represent a major issue in the clinical management
of patients since they could provide targets for both
therapy (i.e., tyrosine kinase inhibitors in FLT3-ITD
positive AML) and molecular monitoring of residual
disease. However, the major impact of these mutations
resides in the stratification of consolidation therapy
once complete response is achieved following induction
chemotherapy. It is now generally accepted that patients
with normal karyotype and favorable genotype (i.e.,
NPM1 or CEBPA mutations without FLT3-ITD mutations)
are no longer referred to allogeneic hematopoietic stemcell transplantation (HSCT) in first complete response
since their outcome with chemotherapy alone is similar
to those receiving HSCT [5]. In addition, patients with
an unfavorable genotype are more readily directed to
allograft from unrelated donors or cord blood units since

their prognosis with chemotherapy alone is dismal. Thus,
FLT3-ITD, CEBPA, NPM1 mutations are now part of the
initial work up of all AML patients with intermediate
cytogenetic risk who undergo intensive treatments [6].
However, newly discovered mutations such as isocitrate
dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) mutations have been
already proposed to refine this molecular stratification
although their prognostic impact remains to be definitely
established [7-8].
Even more recently, by sequencing the genome
of leukemic cells from a patient with AML, Ley et al
have detected somatic mutations in the gene of a DNA
methyltransferase (MTase), DNMT3A [9]. DNMT3A is a
member of the DNA MTases family including DNMT1,
DNMT2, DNMT3A and DNMT3B that are involved in the
methylation of CpG islands [10]. The hypermethylation
of CpG islands that contributes to the downregulation
of gene expression, and notably of tumor suppressor
genes, is also a hallmark of AML [11]. In a series of 281
de novo AML, DNMT3A mutations were found in 22%
of cases, clustering in intermediate-risk cytogenetic
group and associated with a poor outcome. Most of the
DNMT3A mutations (60%) found in AML samples were
missense mutations localized on the R882 amino acid of
the MTase domain. It is noteworthy that R882 mutations
were significantly associated with a high white blood cell
count as compared with other DNMT3A mutations. The
aim of our study was to confirm the prognostic impact of
R882 DNMT3A mutations in a series of 288 AML patients
treated in our institution and to evaluate its screening
usefulness in the medical diagnosis process, in a similar
way to KIT exon 17 screening.

Patients and treatments

Mutation screening

From 2000 to 2009, 457 consecutive patients (1865 years) with untreated de novo AML (excluding acute
promyelocytic leukemia and secondary AML) were
admitted for intensive chemotherapy induction at the
Hematology department of Toulouse University hospital.
In this cohort of patients, 288 samples were available for
genetic screening. Since DNMT3A mutations were only
observed in the intermediate-cytogenetic risk group,
the therapeutic outcome was assessed in this population
(n=194). Figure 1 shows the flow chart of all AML
patients in this period of time. From this cohort of 194
intermediate-risk patients, those ≤ 60 years (n=156)
received either daunorubicin (dnr) (60 mg/m2, d1-3)
(n=112) or idarubicin (ida) (8 mg/m2, d1-5) (n=44) with
cytarabine (AraC) (200 mg/m2, d1-7). A second course
(ida, 8mg/m2 or dnr, 35mg/m2 d17-18 and AraC, 1g/
m2/12h d17-20) was delivered if more than 5% marrow
blasts persisted on d15 [12]. Patients were treated according
to institutional guidelines using daunorubicin as main
anthracycline while some of them received idarubicin
as part of a randomized clinical trial [12]. Patients in
complete response (CR) with HLA-identical sibling were
planned to receive allo-HSCT: (i) after a myeloablative
conditioning regimen consisting of oral busulfan (16
mg/kg over 4 days) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg
over 2 days) for patients less than 51 years; (ii) after one
course of intensive consolidation described below and
reduced intensity conditioning, (oral busulfan, 8 mg/kg
over 2 days, fludarabine, 120 mg/m2 over 4 days, rabbit
anti-thymocyte globulins 2,5 mg/kg on d-4 and d-3) for
patients between 51 and 60 years. Patients with no HLAidentical sibling received a consolidation regimen (ida,
12 mg/m2 or dnr, 60 mg/m2 d1-2 and AraC 3 g/m2/12h
d1-4) then autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT) prepared with
busulfan (4 mg/kg, d-6 to d-3) and melphalan (140 mg/
m2, d-2) or two courses of high-dose AraC (HiDAC).
Since 2008, patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetic
and favorable genotype (mutation of NPM1 or CEBPA
without FLT3-ITD mutation) were no longer allocated to
allo-HSCT in first CR and mainly received three cycles
of HiDAC as consolidation. The induction chemotherapy
for patients older than 60 years (n=38) combined ida (8
mg/m2, d1-5), AraC (100 mg/m2, d1-7) with (n=17) or
without (n=21) lomustine (200 mg/m2, d1). Patients
achieving CR received a consolidation with ida (8 mg/m2,
d1-3) and AraC (50 mg/m2/12h, d1-5) then maintenance
therapy with ida at d1 only and the same scheme of AraC.
Bone marrow AML samples were obtained after informed
consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
All samples were stored in the HIMIP tumor bank of

The mutational status of DNMT3A exon 23 along
with 3 additional mutations (FLT3 TKD exon 20, IDH1
and IDH2 exons 4) were analyzed by high-resolution
melting (HRM) PCR using the Light­
Cycler 480 with
High Melting Resolution Master Mix 1X (Roche Applied
Science), with 10 ng genomic DNA, 0.1 μmol/l of each
primer (see below), and 25 mmol/l MgCl2. HRM PCR
cycling conditions were initial denaturation at 95°C for 10
minutes, followed by 50 cycles at 95°C for 10 seconds, 50
cycles at 63°C for 15 seconds, and 50 cycles at 72°C for
25 seconds. Melting curve was measured from 72°C to
95°C, with 25 acquisitions per degree centigrade. Primer

according to Pabst et al [13].

NOD/SCID mice xenograft
Adult NOD/SCID mice (6-8 weeks old) were
sublethally irradiated with 250 cGy of total body irradiation
24 h before injection of leukemic cells. Leukemia samples
were thawed at room temperature, washed twice and
suspended in PBS at a final concentration of 1-2 million
cells per 200 µL of PBS per mouse for IV injection. Daily
monitoring of mice for symptoms of disease (ruffled coat,
hunched back, weakness, or reduced motility) determined
the time of killing for injected animals with signs of

12 weeks after injection except as otherwise noted.
For assessment of leukemic engraftment, NOD/SCID
mice were humanely killed in accordance with IACUC
protocols. Bone marrow (mixed from tibias and femurs)
and spleen were dissected in a sterile environment, flushed
in PBS and made into single cell suspensions for analysis

were performed using the Mann-Whitney test for
continuous variables and the Fisher’s exact test for
categorical variables. Complete remission (CR) was
defined following Cheson criteria [14]. In univariate
analysis, covariates associated with response to induction
therapy or outcome were identified using Fisher’s exact
test then included in a multivariable logistic model. Overall
survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were
measured from the date of diagnosis until death and from
the date of CR until death or relapse, respectively. Patients
alive were censored at the time of last contact. OS and
DFS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and
compared using the log-rank test. All calculations were

Results
DNMT3A exon 23 mutation is a frequent event in
adult AML
DNMT3A exon 23 screening was performed on
available samples coming from 288 AML patients aged
from 18 to 65-year old and treated in Toulouse between
2000 and 2009. DNMT3A exon 23 mutations were detected
in 39 patients (13.5%) occurring almost exclusively at
the R882 codon (23 R882H; 13 R882C; 2 R882P) and in
one patient at the W893 codon (W893S). No association
between DNMT3A exon 23 mutations and age or sex was
detected.

B

DNMT3A exon 23 mutations occur exclusively in
intermediate cytogenetic risk group
Patients were cytogenetically subdivided according
to the MRC 2010 classification resulting in 46 patients
with low risk, 194 with intermediate risk and 43 with high
risk whereas five patients were not classified in absence
of karyotypes [15]. Patients with a DNMT3A exon 23
mutation were exclusively identified in the intermediaterisk group (39/194, 20%) as compared to CBF and highrisk AML (p<0.001), 27 with a normal karyotype and 12
with various associated abnormalities, the most frequent
being an additional copy of the chromosome 8 (3 patients)
or 13 (2 patients). No DNMT3A exon 23 mutation was
detected in high or low risk groups. Consequently, we

mice and suggest a preferential engraftment of primary
AML specimens with triple FLT3-ITD/NPM1/DNMT3A
mutations in immunodeficient mice.

DNMT3A exon 23 mutations are associated with
FAB M4/M5 subtypes and a higher WBC count

DNMT3A exon 23 mutations have no prognostic
impact in adult AML with intermediate-risk
cytogenetics

The characteristics of intermediate-risk patients
according to DNMT3A mutational status are listed in table
1. A bias toward monocytic differentiation (FAB groups
M4 and M5) was identified in DNMT3A exon 23+ samples
(p<0.0001). A strong association was found between
DNMT3A exon 23+ and a higher white blood cell count
(p=0.001). Platelet count, hemoglobin concentration and
marrow blast percentage at diagnosis were similar in
DNMT3A exon 23+ and – groups.

Analysis of the therapeutic outcome was performed
for the 194 intermediate-risk patients. Of these patients,
160/194 (83%) achieved CR after induction chemotherapy.
The CR rate did not differ according to DNMT3A exon 23
mutational status, with 34/39 (87%) and 126/155 (81%)
CR in the DNMT3A exon 23+ group and DNMT3A exon
23- group, respectively (p=0.48). CR rate was significantly
influenced by leukocytosis with a cut-off at WBC>30 G/L
(95% CI, 0.14-0.68, OR, 0.3, p=0.01) but not by age,
CEBPA, NPM1 or FLT3-ITD mutations. In the DNMT3A
exon 23+ group, 16 (41%) and 7 (18%) patients in first CR
received allo-SCT or auto-SCT as consolidation therapy,
not significantly different from the DNMT3A exon 23group in which 40 (26%) and 28 (18%) received allo-SCT
or auto-SCT, respectively. In these complete responders,
15 events were observed in the DNMT3A exon 23+ group
and 72 events in the DNMT3A exon 23- group (44% and
57% of CR patients, respectively). Disease-free survival
was not significantly different between DNMT3A exon
23+ (median not reached) and DNMT3A exon 23- patients
(median DFS, 17.6 months) (95% CI, 0.87-2.33, HR 1.42,
p=0.16) (figure 2A). There were 17 deaths (44%) in the
DNMT3A exon 23+ group and 88 (57%) in the DNMT3A
exon 23- group. Overall survival was not significantly
different between DNMT3A exon 23+ (median not
reached) and DNMT3A exon 23- patients (median OS,
24.7 months) (95% CI, 0.87-2.19, HR 1.38, p=0.17)
(figure 2B). Among age, WBC count, DNMT3A exon 23
mutations and FLT3/NPM1 genotypes, the only factor
that significantly influenced both DFS and OS was the
FLT3wt/NPM1c genotype (not shown).

DNMT3A exon 23 mutations are associated with
NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations
DNMT3A exon 23 mutations were significantly
associated with FLT3-ITD (17 FLT3-ITD/39 DNMT3A
exon 23+, 44% vs. 37/155 DNMT3A exon 23-, 24%,
p=0.027), NPM1 mutations (29 NPM1c/39 DNMT3A exon
23+, 74% vs. 49/155 DNMT3A exon 23-, 32%, p< 0.001).
No relationship was identified between DNMT3A exon 23
mutations and CEBPA mutations, IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140
and R172 mutations, FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain or KIT
exon 17 mutations. The significant relationship between
DNMT3A exon 23 mutations and NPM1 mutations was
independent of the FLT3-ITD mutation status (p<0.001
in FLT3-ITD+ or FLT3-ITD- in both groups). In contrast,
the relationship between DNMT3A exon 23 mutations
and FLT3-ITD mutations was lost in the NPM1 mutation
subgroups (p=0.700 in NPM1c - and p=0.043 in NPM1c
+ patients), suggesting that the relationship between
DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations was stronger than the
relationship between DNMT3A and FLT3-ITD mutations.

DNMT3A exon 23 mutations are conserved in
xenograft mice models

AML patients with DNMT3A exon 23 mutations
may benefit from idarubicin as compared to
daunorubicin

We next analyzed the mutational status of nine primary
AML samples which showed engraftment capacities in
xenograft NOD/SCID mice model. The presence of FLT3ITD (seven out of nine, data not shown) correlated with
the ability to engraft in these mice as it has been shown
earlier [16-18]. Furthermore, we have also observed that
four of these nine specimens carried the DNMT3A exon
23+ mutations that were associated with FLT3-ITD and
NPM1 mutations (Table 2). For these four samples, we
also analyzed their post-transplantation mutational status
and found that DNMT3A exon 23+ mutations were
conserved in NOD/SCID mice. Overall, these data show
a stability of the DNMT3A mutations in AML engrafted

As we did not find any prognostic impact of DNMT3A
exon 23+ mutations in contrast to previous studies, we
tried to find out whether treatments received by DNMT3A
exons 23+ patients could explain these differences.[9;1920] Because patients who were older than 60 received
idarubicin and lomustin but also because they were much
less frequently allografted, we focalized our analysis
on younger patients (60y or less). The characteristics of
patients according to the type of anthracycline used at
induction are reported in table 3. There was no difference
between patients treated by daunorubicin and those

treated by idarubicin in terms of DFS (median DFS, 22.7
months for DNR vs 22.8 months for Ida, p=0.90) and OS
(median OS, 28.5 months for DNR vs 24.4 months for
Ida, p=0.39). Analysis of covariates associated with both
DFS and OS are shown in table S1-S2. However, there
was a significant impact of DNMT3A exon 23 mutations
in patients treated with idarubicin. DNMT3A exons 23+
patients had better DFS (not reached vs 11.6 months, HR
3.3 , 95% CI, 1.34-8.11, p=0.009) and OS (not reached
vs 14.3 months, HR 3.1, 95% CI, 1.39-6.71, p=0.005) as
compared to DNMT3A exons 23- patients when treated
with idarubicin whereas patients treated with daunorubicin
had similar outcome regardless the DNMT3A mutational
status (figure 3). Conversely, the outcome of patients with
NPM1+/FLT3wt genotype was not impacted by the type
of anthracycline used
in 3induction (Figure S1). In patients

who received allo-SCT (n=53), there was a trend for
improved outcome in DNMT3A exon 23+ patients (DFS
and OS medians not reached) as compared to DNMT3A
exon 23- patients (median DFS, 19.1 months, p=0.15;
median OS, 29.2 months, p=0.1) but the difference did not
reach statistical significance (figure 4). To better address
the effects of idarubicin vs. daunorubicin along with other
variables in DNMT3A mutated patients, we performed
univariate and multivariate analysis. As shown in table 4,
idarubicin had an independent favorable prognostic effect
on OS (HR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.08-0.97, p=0.046) when
considering age, karyotype, NPM1/FLT3wt genotype,
WBC and allo-SCT in DNMT3A mutated patients.

Discussion

Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation

In accordance with the first study assessing DNMT3A
mutations in AML, we confirm here the high prevalence
of DNMT3A exon 23 mutations in a series of 288 de
novo adults AML [9]. We have also observed that these
mutations were exclusively found within the intermediaterisk cytogenetic group, associated with M4/M5 FAB
subtypes and hyperleukocytosis. At the molecular level,
DNMT3A exon 23 mutations were strongly associated
with NPM1 mutations and to a lesser extent with FLT3ITD mutations whereas no correlation was found with
CEBPA, KIT or IDH1/2 mutations.
However, in contrast with previous studies, we
failed to show any prognostic impact of DNMT3A exon
23 mutations in AML with intermediate-risk cytogenetic
[9;19-20]. We acknowledge that our patients had been
treated over a long period of time (nine years) and this
could have potentially introduced some bias. Indeed,
two major changes in the management of AML patients
had been undertaken in our center during this period of
time: the introduction of primary prophylaxis of invasive
fungal infections using azoles (voriconazole from 2003 to
2008, posaconazole thereafter) [21] and the stratification
of allo-HSCT indication according to the new molecular
classification of intermediate-risk AML using CEBPA,
FLT3 and NPM1 mutations. Indeed, patients with wild
type FLT3 and CEBPA or NPM1 mutations were no
longer allocated to allo-HSCT in first CR since the results
published by Schlenk et al.[5]. However, since these two
measures were applied in 2003 and 2008 respectively, their

impact on outcome, if any, could have been negligible in
the whole cohort of patients. Furthermore, our induction
and consolidation regimen have little changed for fifteen
years, particularly the dosing of anthracyclines, with
daunorubicin always given at 60 mg/m2/day for three
days at time of the induction chemotherapy. By contrast,
the doses of anthracyclines are not fully described in the
study of Ley et al, in which several induction regimen
were used, some of them using the infra optimal dose of
45 mg/m2/d [22-24]. Moreover, some patients received
hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide which generally
induce fewer responses than intensive chemotherapy in
AML patients [25-26]. Also, complete response and early
death rates were not mentioned and this could be of interest
as patients with R882 DNMT3A mutations usually have a
high white blood cell count, a recognized risk factor for
early death. In our study, DNMT3A exon 23 mutations did
not impact on both complete response and early death rates.
Moreover, we found that patients with DNMT3A exon
23 mutations could specifically benefit from idarubicin
although the small number of patients in our study
requires confirmation in larger cohorts. The strong impact
of DNMT3A mutations on the response to idarubicin as
compared to daunorubicin is quite unexpected. However,
it has been recently shown that DNMT3A could play a role
in anthracyclines-induced apoptosis of colorectal cancer
cells. Indeed, the expression of DNMT3A is upregulated

at apoptosis-inducing concentrations of doxorubicin and
involved in p21 repression thereby blocking senescence
[27]. Whether this program is induced by idarubicin but
not daunorubicin in DNMT3A mutated/haploinsufficient
cells remains to be determined. Alternatively, DNMT3A
mutations could specifically impact on the expression of
genes involved in idarubicin metabolism as compared
to daunorubicin. The broader spectrum of activity of
idarubicin has been attributed to increased lipophilicity,
cellular uptake and improved stabilization of a ternary
drug-topoisomerase II-DNA complex [28]. Thus,
the discrepancy in therapeutic outcome between our
series and those previously described could be due to
differences in treatment intensity or altered metabolism
of anthracyclines. Several clinical trials have already
assessed the impact of daunorubicin dose intensification
or compared idarubicin vs. daunorubicin in large cohorts
of AML patients. Reassessing results of these controlled
studies in light of DNMT3A mutational status could
easily confirm or not our preliminary observations [12;2223;29-30]. It remains also to be determined if DNMT3A
mutations affect in a similar way the metabolism of
other compounds that intercalates DNA and inhibits
topoisomerase II such as the new quinolone derivative
vosaroxin which is currently assessed in AML [31].
In addition, we were also able to demonstrate for
the first time that DNMT3A mutations are also found in

leukemic samples engrafted in immunodeficient mice.
Although we could not demonstrate that the DNMT3A
exon 23 mutation is a surrogate marker of engraftment
in NOD/SCID mice, it should be noted that all mutated
samples tested recapitulated the initial disease in
mice. By comparison, it has been shown that only
50% of intermediate-risk cytogenetic samples display
engraftment properties in NOD/SCID mice [32]. This
suggests that engraftment properties of AML samples
should be assessed in light of specific molecular lesions.
It has been shown that engraftment in xenograft NOD/
SCID-IL2Rγc-/- mice model did not correlate with FrenchAmerican-British subtype or cytogenetic abnormalities but
with the presence of FLT3-ITD [17]. More recently, Sarry
et al. have observed that a high engraftment level occurred
within human primary AML samples carrying at least two
mutations (seven out of nine samples had FLT3-ITD and
NPM1 mutations) and that these mutations were strongly
conserved in the different leukemic stem cell populations
sorted as well as still present after the first transplantation
into NOD/SCID-IL2Rγc-/- mice [18]. In the present study,
we show that the DNMT3A mutation is also conserved
through the NOD/SCID xenograft model and is associated
with higher leukemic engraftment level in cooperation
with FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations, suggesting that
this mutation occurs in the early leukemogenic events and
belongs to the main leukemic clone over the course of the
disease progression.
In summary, our data confirm that DNMT3A exon 23
mutations can be easily evaluated in medical practice and
represent a frequent molecular event in intermediate-risk
AML associated with NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations but
have no clear impact on disease-free and overall survival.
However, although this finding needs to be confirmed in
largest cohort of patients, DNMT3A mutations could be a
predictive factor for response to idarubicin and, thus could
have a direct influence in the way AML patients should be
managed.
