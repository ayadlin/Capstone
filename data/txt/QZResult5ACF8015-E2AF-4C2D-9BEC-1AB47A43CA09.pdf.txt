BACKGROUND. Ovarian tumors frequently express c-Kit and/or platelet-derived
growth factor receptors (PDGFRs). Imatinib mesylate blocks the growth of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and may enhance the activity of chemotherapy. This
study was conducted to determine the activity of imatinib in combination with
docetaxel in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer
(EOC).

METHODS. Eligible patients had recurrent, platinum-resistant, or refractory EOC
that expressed PDGFRa or c-kit, as determined by immunohistochemistry. Imatinib mesylate at a dose of 600 mg orally once daily was administered continuously with docetaxel at a dose of 30 mg/m2 given intravenously once weekly in
Weeks 1 through 4 of every 6-week cycle. The primary endpoint was objective
response rate (ORR) as assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST).

RESULTS. Thirty-four patients were screened for PDGFRa and c-kit expression to

pithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading
cause of mortality among gynecologic malignancies.1 Treatment relies on surgical debulking and
platinum-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, most
patients develop disease recurrence and become resistant to platinum-based therapy. Subsequent chemotherapy offers only limited and temporary benefit.2,3
The need for more effective therapies that are rooted
firmly in an understanding of the biologic mechanisms that drive tumor growth is both real and
pressing.4 Clinical trials to test inhibitors of growth
factor receptors important to EOC progression are
ongoing.
The platelet-derived growth factor receptors
(PDGFR) a and b are transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases activated by PDGF.5,6 They are implicated in a variety of physiologic and pathologic
processes, including cell growth and survival,7 transformation,8 migration, vascular permeability, stroma
modulation, and wound healing.9 Ligand-induced receptor activation promotes receptor dimerization
and interaction with phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K), phospholipase gC, guanosine triphosphataseactivating protein, and Src kinases10; and intracellular
signaling promotes cell proliferation and survival.
Aside from these effects, the PDGFR is important
functionally to the modulation of stroma, regulating
its interstitial pressure, permeability, and neovascularization.11-13 Consequently, PDGFR blockade affects
tumor cells directly and also affects the tumor microenvironment, increasing stroma permeability, inhibiting angiogenesis, and enhancing the delivery of
chemotherapy.14,15
We initially identified PDGFR over expression in
EOC cells by using microarray hybridization and
comparative analysis between primary cells derived
from ovarian tumors and primary cells derived from
the normal ovarian epithelium.16 The findings were
confirmed by others,17-19 and PDGFR expression was
linked to poor clinical outcome17 and aggressive tumor characteristics.20,21 To date, no activating PDGFR
or c-kit mutations have been identified in EOC.22
However, we observed that the PDGFRs and their
ligands, PDGFA, PDGFB, PDGFC, and PDGFD, are
coexpressed in ovarian tumors and that PDGF is
secreted in ascites fluid.23 These observations indicate that the receptor may be activated through
autocrine or paracrine mechanisms in the peritoneal
milieu.

Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis) is a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative that selectively inhibits the abl, c-kit, and PDGFR tyrosine kinases.24
Imatinib has been studied extensively in chronic myelogenous leukemia25 and in malignancies governed
by abnormally activated PDGFR or c-kit receptors.26
We observed that imatinib inhibited the proliferation
of ovarian cancer cells in vitro19 and decreased vascular endothelial growth factor secretion by EOC
cells,27 findings that supported its clinical investigation in ovarian cancer. However, imatinib had little
activity as monotherapy in 4 previous phase 2 studies in ovarian cancer28-30 (including 1 Gynecologic
Oncology Group study with unpublished results).
Because PDGFRs are highly expressed and functional in fibroblasts, pericytes, and endothelial cells,
we hypothesized that PDGFR inhibition affects the
tumor microenvironment, modulating the interstitial
pressure and angiogenesis,27 and enhancing delivery
of chemotherapy, as suggested previously in preclinical models.13,15,31,32 We set out to test this hypothesis
in a clinical trial combining chemotherapy with imatinib. Synergy between imatinib and docetaxel had
been observed in other tumor models.32,33 In addition, our unpublished preclinical data indicated that
the addition of imatinib lowers 10-fold the 50% inhibitory concentration for docetaxel in EOC cells that
over express protein kinase B (Akt), suggesting that
this combination may overcome Akt-induced chemoresistance. It has been established that activation
of the survival PI3K/Akt pathway is common in EOC
and has been implicated in resistance to chemotherapy.34,35 Therefore, we studied imatinib in combination with weekly docetaxel in patients with recurrent,
platinum-resistant, or refractory EOC who had
tumors that expressed PDGFRa or c-kit using a dose
and schedule that was defined in a previous phase 1
study.36 The primary objectives of this study were to
determine the overall response rate and the tolerability of the regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Patients with advanced, histologically documented
EOC that recurred within 6 months after platinumbased chemotherapy were eligible for screening.
Consenting patients were screened for PDGFRa or ckit expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Imatinib & Docetaxel in Ovarian Cancer/Matei et al

Staining of archival tumor was performed in the
Department of Pathology at Indiana University. Only
patients who harbored PDGFRa- or c-kit-positive
tumors (at least 11 by IHC) were eligible for treatment. Patients with both measurable and detectable
disease were eligible. Measurable disease was defined
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST).37 Patients with nonmeasurable
disease could enroll if they had clinically or radiologically detectable disease (eg, ascites, mesenteric
thickening) and 2 consecutive rising pretreatment serum CA 125 levels >2-fold the nadir or 1 CA 125
measurement >100 IU/mL.
All patients were aged 18 years, had an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(PS) between 0 and 2, and had a life expectancy of at
least 12 weeks. Other eligibility criteria included no
upper limit to the number of prior therapies allowed
and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Key exclusion criteria included prior treatment
with any experimental anticancer agent within 4
weeks of Day 1, prior treatment with docetaxel or
imatinib, a history of brain metastases, clinical evidence of small bowel obstruction or refractory ascites, and use of oral anticoagulation. Prior exposure
to paclitaxel was allowed. All patients provided written informed consent, and the protocol was
approved by institutional review boards.

Treatment Plan
Treatment consisted of docetaxel at a dose of 30 mg/m2
intravenously weekly for 4 of 6 weeks and imatinib
at a dose of 600 mg orally once daily administered
continuously. Each cycle was 6 weeks, and treatment
was continued for a maximum of 6 cycles (36 weeks)
or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
The dose selected was based on a phase 1 study performed in patients with prostate cancer.36 Patients
discontinued therapy if they had recurrent grade 3 or
4 toxicity, as defined by the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event
(NCI-CTCAE), version 3.0; any subjectively intolerable toxicity; or progressive disease. Dexamethasone
was given orally every 12 hours for 3 doses with each
docetaxel infusion.
Efficacy and Toxicity Assessment
Tumor burden was evaluated at baseline by clinical
and image-based evaluation, including computed tomography scans of the abdomen and pelvis. The investigator-determined best overall response was
defined using RECIST for measurable tumors and
Gynecological Cancer Intergroup CA-125 response
criteria for nonmeasurable tumors.38 CA 125 meas-

urements were obtained from all patients on Day 1
of each cycle. Objective response by radiographic criteria was assessed before Cycle 3 and Cycle 5 and at
the end of treatment. Adverse events were assessed
on Day 1 of each cycle and were graded according to
NCI-CTCAE (version 3).

IHC
Paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from the time
of diagnostic surgery were collected at enrollment
from consenting patients and immunostained for
PDGFRa and c-kit. The antibody for PDGFRa was
obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn) at a
concentration of 20 lg/mL, and the antibody to c-kit
was obtained from Oncogene (25 lg/mL; Upstate,
Waltham, Mass). Secondary labeling was based on
the avidin/biotin system (LSAB2 kit; Dako). Slides
were stained with 3-30 diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative controls with
omission of the primary antibody and positive controls for PDGFRa and c-kit were run in parallel. Staining was graded from 0 (no staining) to 31 (strong
staining) by a board-certified pathologist (R.E.E.), and
the percentage of stained cells was noted. Immunoreactivity was recorded only if it was observed in
>15% to 20% of tumor cells. Patients were deemed eligible for treatment if either PDGFRa or c-kit staining
was graded at least 11 in 20% of tumor cells. After
enrollment, archival tumors also were stained for
PDGFRb primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; dilution, 1:200), phosphorylated PDGFRa
primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.;
dilution, 1:50), serine 473 (Ser473) phosphorylated Akt
primary antibody (Cell Signaling; dilution, 1:1000),
and PTEN primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; dilution, 1:50). Positive and negative controls
were run in parallel, and staining was graded from 0
(no staining) to 31 (strong staining). The pathologist
(R.E.E.) was blinded to the specimens’ identity and
corresponding clinical information.
Statistical Analysis
This was an open-label, multicenter study performed
through the Hoosier Oncology Group (protocol Gyn
03-62). The primary objective was measurement of
the overall response rate (ORR), including complete
responses (CR) and partial responses (PR). The secondary objectives were assessment of toxicity, measurement of progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS), and assessment of molecular
predictors of response. In particular, Akt activation
was evaluated as a biomarker of resistance to therapy. PFS was defined as the time from Day 1 of treatment to the time of documented disease progression

or death. OS was defined as the time from Day 1 of
study to the time of death. Duration of response was
defined as the time from the initial CR or PR to the
time of disease progression or death. The tested null
hypothesis of no efficacy is that the response rate of
the experimental treatment is no higher than 20%.
With 23 patients, if the true response rate of the experimental treatment would be 40%, then a 1-sided
exact test for a single proportion has 76% power at
the 10% a level to reject the null hypothesis, and we
would conclude that this combination is clinically
interesting.
Demographic and baseline characteristics were
summarized by using medians (with ranges) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical
variables. Median PFS and OS were estimated by
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Correlations
between clinical response and level of IHC staining
for different molecular biomarkers were assessed
with the Fisher exact test.

RESULTS
Patients
Thirty-four consenting patients with recurrent EOC
underwent prospective screening by IHC for PDGFRa
and c-kit expression in archival tissue. Sixteen specimens were immunoreactive for c-kit, including 11
specimens that also were positive for PDGFRa. In
total, 25 patients had PDGFRa-expressing tumors. Of
all screened patients, 23 were enrolled and treated:
Twelve patients had c-kit-positive tumors, 19 patients
had PDGFRa-positive tumors, and 8 patients had
tumors that expressed both PDGFRa and c-kit (Table 1)
(Fig. 1).
Patient characteristics are presented in Table 2
and indicate that 22 patients developed recurrent

disease during or within 6 months of receiving a
prior platinum-containing regimen. Of those, 7
patients had platinum-refractory disease (progression
through a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen),
and 15 patients had platinum-resistant disease (progression within 6 months after completing platinumbased chemotherapy). One patient was allergic to
platinum. Nineteen patients had measurable disease.
The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens
was 3 (range, 1-9 prior chemotherapy regimens), and
the median patient age was 56 years (range, 33-76
years). The majority of patients had high-grade
tumors that originated the ovary with a serous papillary histologic pattern.

All enrolled patients were included in the analysis of

PRs, all determined by RECIST. The PRs were confirmed by repeat scans, but the CR was not confirmed, because this patient had recurrent grade 3
rash and discontinued imatinib to pursue therapy
with docetaxel alone after 2 cycles. The Kaplan-Meier
estimate of median duration of response has not
been achieved. One of the 5 responders developed
disease recurrence 1.1 months after achieving a
response. The other 4 responders were still in remission at the time of data completion. Three additional

that lasted between 4.2 months and 9 months. The
median PFS was 1.77 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.38-3.78 months), the median OS was
9.56 months (95% CI, 9.03-28.16 months) (Fig. 2),
and the median follow-up was 18.86 months (95%
CI, 13.77-34.46 months). Among the patients deriving
clinical benefit, which was defined either as stable
disease or as an objective response, 3 patients had
PDGFRa-positive tumors, 2 patients had c-kit-positive tumors, and 3 patients had tumors that
expressed both PDGFRa and c-kit. IHC staining characteristics of the patients who derived clinical benefit
are detailed in Table 4.

Molecular Predictors of Response
To identify molecular predictors of response, archival
tumors were analyzed retrospectively for the expression of proteins implicated in PDGFR signaling. On
the basis of our preclinical data19 and other reports
implicating Akt in resistance to chemotherapy,19,35
we speculated that activation of Akt would predict
resistance to treatment. Therefore, tumors were immunostained for Ser473 phosphorylated Akt (pAkt).
We observed that the majority of ovarian tumors
expressed activated Akt, with moderate (21) or
strong (31) Akt staining noted in all but 2 tumors
(Fig. 3) (Table 5), confirming previous reports that
this pathway is highly activated in EOC.34 It is interesting to note that we observed both nuclear and
cytoplasmic pAkt staining: Eleven 11 tumors displayed moderate or strong cytoplasmic pAkt staining,
and 19 tumors displayed 21 to 31 nuclear immunoreactivity. The significance of nuclear localization
of Akt in ovarian cancer cells is not clear; emerging
reports suggest that cellular sublocalization of Akt

has specific functional roles in other tumors.39 However, we did not observe a correlation between pAkt
(either nuclear or cytoplasmic) and clinical response
or PFS (Fisher exact test; P 5 .65).
We also assessed the expression of the phosphatase PTEN, a critical regulator of Akt activity. PTEN
expression (0 staining) was absent in ovarian tumor
cells in 9 of 23 tumors; 11 ovarian tumors expressed
PTEN weekly (11). The PTEN level did not correlate
with response or clinical benefit (Fisher exact test;
P 5 .33).
Phosphorylation of PDGFRa also was measured
by IHC, and moderate staining (21) was recorded
only in 4 samples. Intense immunoreactivity (31)
was not observed. Clinical response or PFS did not
correlate with the presence of PDGFRa phosphorylation (Fisher exact test; P 5 .27).
Finally, we evaluated expression of the related receptor, PDGFRb. Because the b receptor is expressed
strongly in stroma rather than in the epithelial component of tumors, and because no differential
expression of the b receptor has been recorded
between nontransformed and transformed EOC
cells,18 we chose not to use PDGFRb as criterion for
patient selection. However, we investigated its
expression retrospectively and observed that 20 of 23
tumors strongly expressed PDGFRb (21 to 31
immunoreactivity). Its expression did not correlate
with response or with PFS.

DISCUSSION
The PDGF and c-kit receptors are expressed in
EOC, and their targeting is supported by preclinical

models.20 Aside from direct effects on tumor cells,
PDGFR blocking agents modulate stroma by altering
permeability and angiogenesis and facilitate the
penetrance of chemotherapy in the tumor milieu.14,15
The goal of this phase 2 trial was to assess the safety
and efficacy of imatinib in combination with docetaxel in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant,
or refractory ovarian cancer.
The regimen was tested and deemed feasible in
a modular phase 1 trial; dose-limiting toxicities were
fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, and pulmonary edema.36
In the current trial, the combination was tolerated
well; however, regimen-specific toxicities were
recorded. For instance, rash was observed in 7
patients (30%), and 2 of those episodes were
assessed as grade 3. Typically, the rash occurred dur-

ing the first cycle and was responsive to interruption
of therapy and supportive care. In most patients,
imatinib was tolerated upon restarting treatment in
incremental doses and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. The frequency of rash was higher than
previously reported in men who were enrolled in the
phase 1 trial36 and higher than recorded with imatinib mesylate monotherapy.29 Fatigue was a common
effect of treatment, consistent with the known profile
of docetaxel40 and possibly compounded by the
addition of imatinib. Despite the routine use of steroids, another common toxicity was edema and/or
accumulation of peritoneal or pleural fluid, which
was observed in 15 of 23 treated patients and may
have reflected an untoward effect of PDGFR blockade. Previous use of an antibody directed against

(including 11) was considered positive.

PDGFRb was associated with increased interstitial
fluid pressure and edema,41 likely because of inhibition of PDGFRb-expressing stromal cells. The use of
docetaxel in combination with imatinib may have
accentuated this adverse event. In patients with ovarian cancer, in which fluid retention is a common
symptom of the disease, this type of toxicity may be
a confounding factor (ie, increased ascites), accentuating the common clinical manifestations of EOC.
Further development of PDGFR inhibitors for ovarian
cancer should take into account this anticipated
effect.
To enrich the patient population for the presence
of one of the targets of imatinib, we preselected
patients on the basis of PDGFRa and c-kit expression
by IHC. We observed that approximately 50% of the
screened tumors (16 of 34 samples) expressed c-kit.
However, most staining was weak (11), and only 2
tumors displayed moderately intense immunoreactivity (21). It is generally accepted that c-kit over
expression is not a common event in EOC, although
there are reports noting a higher rate of expression
than what we observed in the current study.18,42,43 In
contrast, PDGFRa and PDGFRb are expressed
widely,17,18,23 and this was confirmed by our findings,
in which 25 of 34 tumors stained strongly for
PDGFRa, and 20 of 23 tumors stained intensely for
the b receptor.
In this prospectively selected group of patients,
we observed 5 objective responses and 3 patients
with prolonged disease stabilization (>4 months), for

a rate of clinical benefit of 35%. It is noteworthy that
the responses tended to be sustained, and the median duration of response was not reached. At least 2
of the PRs occurred after a lag of at least 3 months
of treatment, later than what typically would be
expected with cytotoxic therapy, a pattern that suggests potential benefit from adding the biologic agent
(eg, imatinib) to docetaxel. However, the observed
ORR (21.7%) did not meet preset criteria for deeming
the combination clinically interesting. On the basis
of prior reports of clinical trials with docetaxel in
EOC, we had estimated that the ORR to docetaxel
monotherapy would be approximately 20%.40,44-46
However, the group of patients enrolled here was
heavily pretreated, and approximately 50% had
received 4 prior treatments. All but 1 patient had
failed on platinum within 6 months, and all 23
patients had received and failed on taxanes. Therefore, in retrospect, the preset bar of 20% may have
been too high for this group of patients. Another
mitigating factor was the choice of weekly dosing for
docetaxel. There is limited experience with weekly
docetaxel in EOC47,48; and, based on data from other
malignancies, it is possible that weekly regimens
may be less effective than the standard dose,49 which
would explain a lower ORR than anticipated. However, weekly paclitaxel has been studied in EOC, and
responses have been documented in patients with
demonstrated resistance to platinum/paclitaxel delivered on an every-3-week schedule.50,51 Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed effects
in the current study may have been caused by the
use of weekly taxane.
We did not identify molecular predictors of
response among several proteins tested. Neither
expression of PDGFRa, PDGFRb, or c-kit nor activation of PDGFRa (eg, phosphorylation) or Akt (eg,
pAkt) were predictors. We recognize a limitation of
the study is that we did not have access to fresh
biopsies to assess the expression of markers in ‘real
time.’ It is possible that tumor characteristics are
altered as disease progresses and becomes resistant
to chemotherapy. The molecular features at the time
of diagnosis, assessed by using archival tissue, may
differ significantly from what would be observed
several lines of therapy later. However, obtaining
fresh tumor tissue from patients with advanced cancer often is limited by clinical, ethical, and financial
constraints.52 Other variability in biomarker data,
and particularly in the assessment of phosphorylated
(activated) proteins, may be related to technical
aspects, such as procurement and preservation of tumor tissue without activating phosphatases. This
may be a confounding factor, because the tissues

Imatinib & Docetaxel in Ovarian Cancer/Matei et al

that we used in the current study were obtained
from multiple institutions using different procedures
for tissue fixation and preservation.
In conclusion, the current trial confirmed that
the expression of PDGFR is common in EOC, more
so than c-kit expression, and demonstrated the feasibility of a combined approach using chemotherapy
and PDGFR inhibition. The combination of imatinib
and docetaxel induced few responses in heavily pretreated patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. However, there was no clear benefit of this
combination over docetaxel alone. Because imatinib
had limited activity as monotherapy in EOC, further
exploration of PDGFR blockade should focus on the
effects of imatinib or other PDGFR inhibitors on
stroma, modulation of angiogenesis, and facilitation
of chemotherapy delivery.
