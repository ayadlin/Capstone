BACKGROUND. The risk, severity, and patient-reported outcomes of radiation-induced
mucositis among head and neck cancer patients were prospectively estimated.

METHODS. A validated, patient-reported questionnaire (OMDQ), the FACT quality
of life (QOL), and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) fatigue scales were used to measure mucositis (reported as mouth and throat soreness), daily functioning, and use of analgesics. Patients were studied before
radiotherapy (RT), daily during RT, and for 4 weeks after RT.

RESULTS. Contrary to previous reports, the risk of mucositis was virtually identical in the 126 patients with oral cavity or oropharynx tumors (99% overall; 85%
grade 3-4) compared with 65 patients with tumors of the larynx or hypopharynx
(98% overall; 77% grade 3-4). The mean QOL score decreased significantly during
RT, from 85.1 at baseline to 69.0 at Week 6, corresponding with the peak of
mucositis severity. The mean functional status score decreased by 33% from 18.3
at baseline to 12.3 at Week 6. The impact of mucositis on QOL was proportional

to its severity, although even a score of 1 or 2 (mild or moderate) was associated
with a significant reduction in QOL (from 93.6 at baseline to 74.7 at Week 6). De-

mucositis scores exceeded 2.5 at Week 6.

CONCLUSIONS. Mucositis occurs among virtually all patients who are undergoing
radiation treatment of head and neck cancers. The detrimental effects on QOL
and functional status are significant, and opioid analgesia provides inadequate

Patient-reported Outcomes of Mucositis/Elting et al

M

ucositis is a painful and debilitating side effect
of radiation therapy (RT) for head and neck
cancers1 and is exacerbated by concomitant chemotherapy.2 Mucositis lesions, characterized by ulceration and pseudomembranous formations, occur in
the oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx. Oral
mucositis is a consistent finding in patients treated
for oral cavity and/or oropharynx tumors, but the
reported incidence and severity are less among individuals treated for larynx or hypopharynx cancers.3,4
However, nonoral mucosal lesions are not easily
observed; thus, it is likely that the frequency of
mucositis of the hypopharynx is underreported.
In addition to the challenges of observing mucositis lesions, there is no agreement on a method for
measuring mucositis’ severity, even though numerous
scales are in use.1 Even when the same scale is used,
inconsistent scoring by clinicians leads to conflicting
estimates of risk and severity.5 For example, 2 recent
reports of similar induction regimens for head and
neck cancer had dramatically different estimates of
mucositis incidence.6,7 Reliance on retrospective
analysis of mucositis risk and severity also likely
leads to major underreporting and a failure to
appreciate the severity of the problem.
Finally, there are few estimates of the impact of
mucositis on patients’ experiences during therapy.
Recent reports suggest concordance between clinical
assessments of mucositis severity and patientreported outcomes,8,9 but, historically, there has
been a marked disconnect between the two. This is
particularly likely when mucositis involves sites not
easily observed by clinicians. Reports of impact on
quality of life (QOL) also have been variable.1,10,11

Mucositis is a significant clinical challenge and
causes a major burden for head and neck cancer
patients and their caregivers; its impact on the cost
of care may be substantial.3,12 Accurate characterization of the significance of these burdens is complicated by underreporting of mucositis, inconsistent
measurement of severity, retrospective assessments
of risk and severity, and failure to examine outcomes
from the patient’s perspective. To address these
issues, we conducted a prospective, multinational
study of the burden of illness and patient-reported
outcomes of radiation-induced mucositis among
patients with head and neck cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Risk, clinical outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes of mucositis were prospectively examined
among patients with squamous cell carcinomas of
the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx
(stages I-III) who received a cumulative dose of least
40 Gy of radiation therapy (RT) in single daily factions with or without subsequent boost and/or chemotherapy, at 30 centers in the United States, Europe,
Australia, and Canada, to ensure that results could be
generalized to other populations (grading determined
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer
grading system). After patients signed informed consent forms, we evaluated patients at baseline, then
followed them prospectively throughout RT for weight
loss, placement of gastric tubes (G-tubes), and treatment breaks or dose reductions. By using patientreported mouth and throat soreness (MTS), we
assessed daily mucositis severity and simultaneously

assessed analgesic use at baseline and daily during RT
by using the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire
(OMDQ).8,13 At baseline and each week, patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
(FACT-G), the Esophagus Cancer subscale (ECS) QOL,
and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness
Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue subscale questionnaires in
their preferred language.14–16 Although esophagitis
was not evaluated in this investigation, the ECS questions were relevant to our study population.

Definitions
Mucositis was measured on the basis of patientreported MTS, defined as any positive response to
Question 2 of the previously validated OMDQ (Fig.
1). MTS was measured on a scale of 0 (no soreness)
to 4 (extreme soreness;). By using the same tool, Stiff
et al found that bone marrow transplant patients’
MTS scores were comparable to clinicians’ assessments of oral mucositis, a finding which supports
our use of this endpoint.8
Clinical outcomes (nonprophylactic insertion of
G-tubes, weight loss) were collected prospectively.
Analgesic use was defined as a positive response to
OMDQ Question 7, ‘‘During the past 24 hours did
you take any medication for pain?’’ and further characterized by week of RT as none, occasional (use for
1-3 days), or regular (use for 4-7 days). Weight
change during RT was calculated as the difference
between the baseline weight and the weight recorded
at the first follow-up visit 3 weeks after RT was completed.
Statistical Considerations
Mucositis risk was calculated as the percentage of
patients who reported any MTS at any time during
RT and further characterized by maximal grade during RT. The mean MTS score during each week of RT
was computed for each patient and summarized by
week (Fig. 2) for all patients. Analgesic use was categorized as defined previously and described by week
of RT (Fig. 3).
The mean FACT-G score and the esophageal cancer, fatigue, physical well-being, and functional wellbeing subscale scores were also summarized by
mean scores and described by week of RT (Fig. 4).
Normative reference scores and minimally important
differences were based on those previously reported
in the literature (Table 1). The percentage change
from baseline in FACT-G, and esophagus cancer,
fatigue, physical and functional wellbeing subscales
was calculated for each week of RT, compared with
baseline, and summarized as a mean percentage
change by week (Fig. 5).

For analyses of clinical outcomes of mucositis,
patients were categorized into 2 groups, by maximum MTS score during RT (0, 1, or 2 vs 3, 4). The
percentage of patients with each outcome was computed for each of the 2 MTS groups (Table 2).
Patients were further categorized on the basis of
baseline MTS score (0 vs >0 MTS score), and outcomes were reported as described above in Table 2.
No hypotheses were tested in this descriptive study.
However, large differences between the 2 MTS
groups were tested for statistical significance by 2tailed chi-square tests. Differences in mean weight
change were tested by 2-tailed Student t test.

RESULTS
Two hundred forty-one patients completed RT, 156
with oral cavity and/or oropharynx cancers and 85
with larynx and/or hypopharynx cancers. Among
these, 36 (15%) patients withdrew from the study
before 40 Gy had been administered, and they
were excluded from the study. Daily diary completion
compliance was excellent. Only 14 (6%) patients
were ineligible because they failed to complete at
least 3 diary entries each week. Thus, 191 (126 oral
cavity and/or oropharynx and 65 larynx and/or hypopharynx) patients could be evaluated for analysis.
Inevaluable patients were clinically and demographically indistinguishable from evaluable patients except
that inevaluable patients were less likely to receive
concomitant chemotherapy (0% vs 60%; P < .001) and
concomitant boost radiation (5% vs 34%; P <.001). All
patients ultimately received the same median doses
of RT (oral cavity and/or oropharynx 5 66 and 69 Gy;
larynx and/or hypopharynx 66 and 70 Gy). Because
most patients who could not be evaluated withdrew
before 40 Gy of RT were administered, their maximal
MTS score on study was lower than that reported by
those patients who could be evaluated (oral cavity
and/or oropharynx 5 2.6 and 3.3; larynx and/or
hypopharynx 5 2.4 and 3.2, respectively). However,
it is notable that during Weeks 3-4, when most
withdrawals took place, patients who could not be evaluated had mean MTS scores virtually identical to the
mean MTS scores of patients who could be evaluated
(oral cavity and/or oropharynx 5 2.6 and 2.3; larynx
and/or hypopharynx 5 2.4 and 2.3, respectively).
Distributions of mean age, sex, and race of the
oral cavity and/or oropharynx and larynx and/or
hypopharynx groups were similar (Table 2). There
were differences in concomitant chemotherapy (66%
vs 48%; P 5 .02) and intensity-modulated radiation
therapy rates (71% vs 29%; P < .001) between the
oral cavity and/or oropharynx and larynx and/or

hypopharynx groups, respectively, because of different standards of care. Patients in the larynx and/or
hypopharynx group had significantly lower stages of
disease than their counterparts with oral cavity and/
or oropharynx cancers (P < .001; Table 2). Small differences in baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) status reflected the expected clinical
presentations of the 2 populations. However, the
mean FACT-G, ECS, and FACIT-fatigue scores at
baseline were virtually identical and were similar to
those previously reported for head and neck cancer

patients (FACT-G head and neck normative reference
value 5 73.1; standard deviation [SD] 5 17.8).17,18
Fifty-six percent of oral cavity and/or oropharynx
and 44% of larynx and/or hypopharynx patients

48 Gy to 74 Gy vs larynx and/or hypopharynx 5 68

RT doses also were the same (oral cavity and/or

Risk of Mucositis
The risk of mucositis was the same for patients with
oral cavity and/or oropharynx and larynx and/or
hypopharynx (99% and 98%, respectively). The maximal MTS score during RT also was the same for the 2
groups (MTS 5 0, 2% and 2%; MTS 5 1, 3% and 3%;
MTS 5 2, 10% and 18%; MTS 5 3, 48% and 42%;
and MTS 5 4, 37% and 35%). Furthermore, the pat-

tern of MTS severity over time was identical, peaking
at Week 6 and remaining elevated at Week 10 of the
study, 3 weeks after completion of RT (Fig. 2). More
than 80% of patients reported MTS of 3 or 4 at some
time during RT. Of the 98 patients who reported MTS
>0 at baseline, none reported decreased MTS during
RT, and all but 9 reported an increase in MTS during
RT. There were no differences in risk of MTS among
study sites (P 5 .79).
Use of chemotherapy did not significantly
increase the risk of severe mucositis. Among patients
with oral cavity and/or oropharynx tumors, 88% of
those who received chemotherapy developed grade
3-4 MTS compared with 85% of those who did not
receive chemotherapy (P 5 .93). Only 1 oral cavity

and/or oropharynx patient escaped mucositis. Similarly, among patients with larynx and/or hypopharynx tumors, 90% of those who received
chemotherapy developed grade 3-4 MTS compared
with 76% of those who did not receive chemotherapy
(P 5 .65). Again, only 1 larynx and/or hypopharynx
patient escaped mucositis. The risk of grade 3-4 MTS
was not significantly altered by either intensitymodulated radiation therapy (88% with intensitymodulated radiation therapy vs 74% without
intensity-modulated radiation therapy; P 5 .41) or
concomitant boost (85% with boost vs 79% without
boost; P 5 .75).
These results show that the 2 cancer groups were
demographically and clinically similar at baseline,
received similar RT doses over the same time
(although to different locations), and shared the same
risk, severity, and duration of mucositis during RT.
This observation supports the argument that RT,
rather than cancer site, is the major driver of mucositis. On the basis of these similarities, the 2 groups
were combined for analysis of outcomes of mucositis.

Clinical Outcomes
Only 12% of the MTS 0-2 group compared with 40%
of the MTS 3-4 group required nonprophylactic
insertion of G-tubes during RT (P 5 .005). Among
these, 67% and 78%, respectively, were inserted as a
direct result of mucositis (P 5 .56; Table 3). Weight
loss among patients with severe MTS was double
that observed among patients with MTS 0-2 (5 kg vs
2 kg; P 5 .02).

have reduced their MTS scores effectively. At Week
10, >50% of patients still required analgesics.
Thirty-four percent of the MTS 0-2 group and only
4% of the MTS 3-4 group reported using no analgesics during the entire study.
Opioid use was significantly more frequent
among patients with severe MTS (70%) compared
with patients with MTS 0-2 (44%; P 5 .004; Table 3).
Furthermore, 87% of patients with severe MTS used
analgesics regularly during RT compared with only
65% of patients with MTS 0 -2. Patients who reported
baseline MTS >0 were more likely to report regular
use of analgesics and use of opioids than those with
MTS 5 0 at baseline. Antifungal agents also were
used more commonly by patients with severe MTS
(27% vs 12%; P 5 .06). There were no differences in
use of other antimicrobials among the MTS groups.
(Data not shown.)

Patient-reported Outcomes
RT and the resulting MTS had a significant and prolonged negative effect on patient-reported QOL. QOL
scores began to fall early in the course of RT, before
MTS scores rose, and FACT-G (general health), functional well-being, physical well-being, and esophageal subscale scores all fell significantly within 1
week of starting treatment (Figs. 4 and 5). Fatigue
scores paralleled the QOL scores. All QOL scores

continued to decline until Week 6, coinciding with
the peak of MTS, at which time the mean FACT-G
score had fallen from 85.1 at baseline to 69. The
mean functional well-being subscale score decreased
by 33% from 18.3 at baseline to 12.3 at Week 6. Even
among patients whose peak MTS was only mild or
moderate, mean FACT-G scores decreased from 93.6
at baseline to 74.7 at Week 6.
After Week 6, all QOL and fatigue scores rose
(improved) as MTS severity scores fell. However, at
the end of the study at Week 10, despite this being 3
weeks after completion of RT, all QOL scores
remained significantly lower (poorer) than baseline,
and MTS remained elevated. The ECS score fell significantly in the oral cavity and/or oropharynx
cohort. The social and emotional well-being scales
did not fall significantly during treatment. Overall,
increasing MTS was associated with significant
fatigue and reduction in physical and functional
well-being.

DISCUSSION
There is general consensus that mucositis is a common, significant, and costly toxicity of RT for oral
cavity and/or oropharynx cancers, but mucositis is
less prevalent among patients who are receiving
similar treatment for larynx and/or hypopharynx
tumors.3 Disparities exist between perceived risk and
severity of mucositis, the burdens these cause

Patient-reported Outcomes of Mucositis/Elting et al

patients, and the burden upon healthcare system.
Gaps also exist between clinicians’ assessments of severity and patients’ experience of severity.19 We,
therefore, undertook a prospective, multinational
study of risks and outcomes of mucositis, measured
by patient-reported MTS, among patients with head
and neck cancers who were receiving RT.
In contrast to most previous reports, we found
no differences in risk, severity, or course of mucositis among patients with oral cavity and/or oropharynx cancers compared with patients with larynx
and/or hypopharynx cancers. Almost every patient
developed mucositis during RT; 80% reported severe
MTS. The peak severity, time course, and duration
were also identical. It is likely that the limitations of
conventional clinical assessment account for the
discrepancy between our observations and previous
reports. Our measure of mucositis included both
mouth and throat soreness. Although the tissues of
the mouth are easily observed in a standard clinical
examination, the mucosa of the lower oropharynx,
the hypopharynx, and the larynx are not. Consequently, in cases in which most damage is not seen
and no patient-reported surrogate is captured, incidence may be underestimated. On the basis of our
data, risk and severity of RT-induced mucositis are
equivalent, no matter where it occurs in the upper
digestive tract. A recent report in which MTS data
were collected in head and neck cancer patients
supports this finding, as no difference in MTS
between patients with larynx and/or hypopharynx
cancers and other head and neck cancers was
seen.9
Neither use of intensity-modulated radiation
therapy nor concomitant chemotherapy altered
mucositis risk or severity. Data suggesting mucositissparing among intensity-modulated radiation therapy
treated head and neck cancer patients have been
inconsistent. Although some investigations propose a
benefit,20,21 results of prospective studies have failed
to confirm reduced mucositis risk with intensitymodulated radiation therapy.22 We found no difference in MTS between patients treated with conventional RT compared with intensity-modulated
radiation therapy. Similarly, our results contrast with
prior studies2 that suggest concomitant chemotherapy confers an increased risk of mucositis as measured by clinician assessment and agree with those
in which patient-reported endpoints were used.9
These findings suggest imperfect congruence between the experience of mucositis and its observable
manifestations. These findings also underscore the
importance of measuring both clinician-reported and
patient-reported outcomes.

Our findings are in agreement with earlier
reports of strong associations between mucositis
and adverse clinical and patient-reported outcomes.3,9,23,24 The reduction in QOL associated with
MTS was significant, and there was a correlation
between severity of MTS and drop in QOL. A reduction in score of >4 points is considered significant
with the FACT and FACIT scales, and this occurred
with an MTS score of only 1 or 2,25–29 with further
drops for each increase in MTS. Again, the drop in QOL
persisted until Week 10, in parallel with raised MTS.
As expected, therapeutic G-tube placement was
significantly associated with severe mucositis.
Whereas 40% of patients with grade 3-4 MTS
received nonprophylactic insertion of G-tubes, similar treatment was reported in only 12% of patients
with grade 1-2 MTS. Whereas variation in local practice patterns influences G-tube placement, mucositis
was cited as the most common cause of G-tube placement in both MTS groups. This rate is consistent
with rates reported in previous studies. Vera-Llonch
et al2 reported feeding-tube placement or use of total
parenteral nutrition in 34% of head and neck cancer
patients with moderate or severe mucositis. In a
study reporting resource use at a single center, Elting
et al12 noted that of patients who developed grade 34 mucositis, 18% of those who received radiation
only and 38% of individuals who received chemoradiation required G-tube placement during RT. Trotti
et al3 noted that 33% of patients who were receiving
chemoradiation for treatment of cancers of the head
and neck had feeding-tube placement, compared
with only 18% who received conventional radiation
only.
The use of antifungal agents was twice as common
(26.8%) in patients with severe mucositis compared
with those with mild mucositis. Given the lack of effective mucositis interventions, clinicians may have prescribed antifungal agents hoping to ameliorate
symptoms, despite reports that the incidence of oral
candidiasis does not vary with mucositis severity.12
Consistent with previous reports, virtually all
patients (96%) with grade 3-4 MTS used analgesics
during RT. By the time MTS scores peaked at Weeks
5-6, greater than 60% of patients were regularly using
analgesics, and almost 90% required analgesics at
least 1 day per week. More than half of study subjects were using pain medication at Week 10. The
majority of patients with grade 1-2 MTS were treated
with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; however,
greater than 70% of patients with MTS scores 3
required opioids. Considering the severity of patientreported MTS, the frequency of analgesic use was
not surprising. However, the persistence of high MTS

scores despite the use of narcotics is a startling finding. Clearly, effective pain control was not achieved.
The poor pain control achieved through appropriate prescription of analgesics underscores the importance of developing management strategies that
do more than control the symptoms of mucositis.
Prevention of mucositis and reduction of its severity
are critical to achieving a true improvement in
patient-reported symptoms and outcomes.

Conclusion and Summary
Our prospective, patient-reported data show that virtually all patients who are undergoing RT with or
without chemotherapy for head and neck cancer develop MTS of a sufficient severity to reduce QOL and
require analgesics. Even an MTS score of 1 or 2 (mild
or moderate) is associated with reduced QOL, and
the reduction increases with increasing MTS.
Increasing MTS is also associated with increasing
weight loss and a need for G-tube feeding. There is
no difference in risk, severity, or outcomes between
patients with oral cavity and/or oropharynx and larynx and/or hypopharynx tumors, despite previous
reports to the contrary. In a large proportion of
patients, use of opioid analgesics does not adequately palliate symptoms. We conclude that symptomatic management of mucositis is insufficient to
avoid negative clinical and patient-reported outcomes. There is a clear need for agents that reduce
the incidence and/or severity of mucositis.
