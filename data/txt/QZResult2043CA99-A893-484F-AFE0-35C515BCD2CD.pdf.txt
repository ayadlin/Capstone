Abstract

Author Manuscript

Little is known about chromatin mechanisms that regulate tumor-initiating cells that are proposed
to be responsible for tumor recurrence and relapse. We have previously shown that Pygopus 2
(Pygo2), a chromatin effector and context-dependent Wnt signaling co-activator, regulates
mammary gland development by expanding epithelial stem/progenitor cells. However, the role of
Pygo2 in mammary tumorigenesis in vivo remains to be addressed. In this study, we show that
epithelia-specific ablation of Pygo2 in MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mice results in delayed mammary
ductal elongation, but the hyperbranching phenotype, aberrant accumulation of stem/progenitorlike cells, and canonical Wnt signaling output are largely unaffected. Chronic loss of Pygo2
significantly delays mammary tumor onset in MMTV-Wnt1 females, whereas acute deletion of
Pygo2 in MMTV-Wnt1 tumor cells leads to a significant decrease in their tumor initiating
capability upon transplantation. Finally, we provide evidence supporting a role for Pygo2 in
modulating the lineage potential of MMTV-Wnt1 tumor initiating cells. Collectively, our results
suggest that Pygo2 acts at a step downstream of mammary stem cell accumulation to facilitate
transformation, and that it regulates the tumor initiating capacity and lineage preference of the
already transformed mammary cells, in MMTV-Wnt1 mice. These findings offer valuable insights
into our understanding of the molecular basis of heterogeneity within breast tumors.

INTRODUCTION
Tumor heterogeneity remains a major challenge to cancer therapy. The cancer stem cell
hypothesis posits that a small subset of cells in a given tumor are capable of long-term selfrenewal, generating multiple cell types that constitute a heterogeneous tumor, and initiating
a new tumor that resembles the original one (hence also termed tumor-initiating cells) (1).
Growing evidence suggests the existence of tumor-initiating cells in both leukemia and solid
tumors including breast cancer (2, 3). However, our current understanding of the molecular
pathways that regulate tumor-initiating cells is limited to a small number of signaling
pathways and regulatory factors such as Wnt, Hh, Notch, and Bmi-1 (4–8). Identification of
novel regulators will not only uncover basic mechanisms of cancer stem cell regulation, but
also increase the repertoire of potential molecular targets for clinical intervention.

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is essential for myrid developmental processes
including mammary gland (MG) development (9). Pygopus 2 (Pygo2) is a member of the
Pygopus protein family initially discovered as a transcriptional co-activator of the Wnt/βcatenin pathway, but later found to also possess the ability to directly bind to histone H3 that
is trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) (10–15). Moreover, Pygo2 associates with histonemodifying enzymes and recruits them to target chromatin to facilitate H3K4 trimethylation
and histone acetylation in normal mammary epithelial progenitor cells as well as breast
cancer cell lines (15–18). Loss of Pygo2 results in defective MG morphogenesis
accompanied by suboptimal expansion of developmental mammary epithelial progenitor
cells, underscoring the importance of this histone-code reader in regulating normal tissue
stem/progenitor cells (15). Up-regulated expression of Pygo2 has been reported in malignant
tumors of several tissues including the breast (19). However, whether Pygo2 regulates
tumorigenesis, particularly tumor-initiating cells, in vivo remains to be addressed.

Mammary tumors produced by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Wnt1 transgenic mice
are histologically heterogeneous, containing multiple cell lineages within a single tumor
(20–22). These tumors contain discrete population(s) of tumor initiating cells, unlike other
tumor models such as MMTV-ErbB2 in which all tumor cells exhibit similar tumor-initiating
capacity (21, 23). Moreover, the preneoplastic mammary tissue in MMTV-Wnt1 mice is
highly enriched for stem/progenitor-like cells, including the mammary stem cell (MaSC)enriched basal (MaSC/basal) cell population (24–26). As such, MMTV-Wnt1 mice offer an
ideal model to study the molecular regulation of cancer stem cells and the cell of origin of
breast cancers (23, 27, 28). In the current work, we studied the impact of Pygo2 deletion on
MMTV-Wnt1-induced mammary outgrowth and tumorigenesis. We show that Pygo2 loss
from the mammary epithelia exerts a context-dependent effect on stem/progenitor cells in
the preneoplastic tissue, and dramatically delays tumor onset. We also provide evidence for
a functional involvement of Pygo2 in regulating tumor initiation as well as lineage
differentiation of MMTV-Wnt1 tumor cells.

RESULTS
Elevated expression of Pygo2 in MMTV-Wnt1 MGs and tumors

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have reported elevated Pygo2 expression in human breast cancer cells (16,
19). Consistently, our interrogation of the publically available gene expression data (29)
revealed a significantly elevated level of Pygo2 mRNA in invasive ductal carcinoma
samples compared with normal tissue controls (Supplemental Figure 1). To further explore
the involvement of Pygo2 in tumorigenesis in vivo, we examined its expression in
preneoplastic and tumorous mammary tissues from the MMTV-Wnt1 mice. Quantitative RTPCR analysis revealed elevated level of Pygo2 mRNA in MMTV-Wnt1 tumors, whereas
mRNA up-regulation in the preneoplastic tissues was insignificant (Figure 1A). The level of
Pygo2 protein was consistently higher in MMTV-Wnt1 MGs than littermate controls, and
was further elevated in MMTV-Wnt1 tumors (Figure 1B, Supplemental Figure 2). As
previously shown in wild-type MGs (15), Pygo2 protein was detected in nearly all luminal
cells and a subset of basal/myoepithelial cells of the ducts, as well as in body cells and some
cap cells of the terminal end buds (TEBs) of the MMTV-Wnt1 MGs (Figure 1C, D).
Moreover, a majority of the tumor cells from MMTV-Wnt1 mice exhibited prominent
presence of the Pygo2 protein (Figure 1C). Significant nuclear staining was also observed in
the surrounding stromal cells (Figure 1C). Together, our findings suggest that elevated
Pygo2 expression is an early hallmark of tumorigenesis in the MMTV-Wnt1 model.
Pygo2 regulates the preneoplastic phenotype of MMTV-Wnt1 MGs in a context-dependent
manner

Author Manuscript

To examine whether Pygo2 is functionally involved in MMTV-Wnt1-induced overgrowth,
we introduced keratin 14 (K14)-Cre-mediated conditional ablation of Pygo2 (skin/mammary
gland epithelia-specific knockout of Pygo2; Pygo2 SSKO) (15) into the MMTV-Wnt1
transgenic mice. K14 normally marks the multipotent progenitor cells of developing
mammary epithelia and the basal population of the mature MG including the multipotent
stem cells that are responsive to Wnt signals (24, 30). As such, K14-Cre can be used to
inactivate luminally expressed genes (31), and its expression indeed resulted in
recombination at the ROSA26R locus (32) in not only basal but also luminal epithelial cells
of adult MG.(Supplemental Figure 3). Importantly, immunohistochemistry revealed
depletion of Pygo2 protein expression from mammary epithelial cells but not from stromal
cells of the MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2 SSKO mice, validating the targeting approach (Figure 1C).

Author Manuscript

MMTV-Wnt1-induced preneoplastic mammary phenotype arises early (apparent 2 weeks
after birth) (20) and Pygo2 regulates MG morphogenesis (15). Therefore, we examined the
genetic interaction between MMTV-Wnt1 and Pygo2 during postnatal MG development. The
loss of epithelial Pygo2 did not rescue the hyperbranching phenotype of developing (3–8
weeks) MMTV-Wnt1 MGs (Figure 2A–C, Supplemental Figure 4), or impact the MG
branching morphology of aged MMTV-Wnt1 virgin females (data not shown). Moreover, the
phenotypes of smaller TEBs and delayed ductal elongation previously reported for Pygo2
SSKO mice (15) were still observed in MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2 SSKO mice (Figure 2A, D, E,
and Supplemental Figure 4). As in Pygo2 SSKO mice, the ductal elongation phenotype was
no longer present in mature MGs of MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2 SSKO mice that were 12 weeks or

older (data not shown). Thus, Pygo2 deletion causes a transient retardation of mammary
ductal elongation despite the presence of the MMTV-Wnt1 transgene.
To further address any functional convergence between MMTV-Wnt1 and Pygo2, we
analyzed male MMTV-Wnt1 mice where rudimentary MG development occurs without the
influence of female hormones (33). Remarkably, Pygo2 deletion rescued the abnormal
mammary tree formation observed in MMTV-Wnt1 males (Figure 2F, G). Therefore, Pygo2
is required for MMTV-Wnt1-induced mammary hyperbranching in a hormone-independent
environment.
Pygo2 loss leads to a reduced number of TEB K6+ progenitor cells, whereas the aberrant
MaSC/basal cells in MMTV-Wnt1 MGs still accumulated but showed altered gene
expression

Characteristic cellular features of the preneoplastic MMTV-Wnt1 MGs include aberrant
accumulation of keratin 6 (K6)-expressing progenitor cells (25) and an expanded Lin−
CD24+CD29high MaSC/basal population (24) (Figure 3A–C). We first compared the
distribution of K6+ cells in developing MMTV-Wnt1 MGs with and without Pygo2. While
normally K6+ cells were concentrated in the TEBs but scattered in the ducts (34), the
abundance of these cells was significantly increased in the ducts but decreased in the TEBs
of MMTV-Wnt1 MGs (Figure 3A, B). Furthermore, the MMTV-Wnt1 ductal K6+ cells often
co-expressed basal marker K14 and luminal marker keratin 8 (K8) (Figure 3A,
Supplemental Figure 5), suggestive of the accumulation of bipotent progenitor cells.
Importantly, loss of Pygo2 did not affect the aberrant ductal progenitor cells, but resulted in
a further decrease of TEB K6+ cells in MMTV-Wnt1 MGs (Figure 3A, B). An overall picture
emerging from this and previous analyses (15) is that MMTV-Wnt1 and Pygo2 regulate
distinct but possibly overlapping progenitor cell pools, with MMTV-Wnt1 preferentially
stimulating the accumulation of ductal bipotent K6+ progenitor cells, whereas Pygo2
preferentially regulating K6+ progenitor cells in the TEB.

Author Manuscript

We also examined whether MMTV-Wnt1 and Pygo2 converge to regulate the
Lin−CD24+CD29high MaSC/basal population in adult MG (Figure 3C). Deletion of Pygo2
did not affect the aberrant expansion of this population, nor did it affect the size of the
Lin−CD24+CD29lowCD61high luminal progenitor cell population (35), in MMTV-Wnt1
MGs. Despite the apparently normal surface marker expression, we wondered whether the
accumulated MaSC/basal cells in MMTV-Wnt1 MGs might be affected in gene expression
by Pygo2 loss. Towards this end, we performed DNA microarray analysis using
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified MaSC/basal cells from wild-type,
MMTV-Wnt1, and MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2 SSKO MGs. This analysis revealed overall similar
transcriptional profiles between MMTV-Wnt1 and MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2 SSKO MaSC/basal
cells (Supplemental Figure 6A). Using a stringent cut-off (fold change >2 and p
value<0.05), only 331 and 22 genes were differentially expressed between wild type and
MMTV-Wnt1, and between MMTV-Wnt1 and MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2 SSKO populations,
respectively (Supplemental Table 1). In addition, Pygo2 loss did not exhibit a consistent
effect on the expression of select Wnt target genes (Supplemental Figure 6B). With these
said, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) detected significant alterations in specific

signature gene sets (Figure 3D). Of note, genes involved in cell cycle/proliferation control
and chromosome regulation were enriched in MMTV-Wnt1, whereas genes involved in
extracellular matrix/cell adhesion were enriched in MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2 SSKO MaSC/basal
cells.
Loss of epithelial Pygo2 delays mammary tumor onset in MMTV-Wnt1 mice

Author Manuscript

In contrast to the lack of a strong effect on hyperbranching, Pygo2 deletion significantly
delayed the onset of mammary tumors in female MMTV-Wnt1 mice, with 50% tumor-free
survival being extended from 225 days in MMTV-Wnt1 to 492 days in MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2
SSKO mice (p=0.007 by Log-rank test) (Figure 4A). The mixed strain background used in
this study did not significantly affect tumor incidence in MMTV-Wnt1 mice (Figure 4A).
Tumors that did form in MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2 SSKO mice were largely composed of Pygo2negative cells, with Pygo2 signal being detected only in the stromal compartment (Figure
4B), and showed variable growth rate with no consistent difference from the controls (data
not shown). Furthermore, tumor cells isolated from the MMTV-Wnt1 and MMTV-Wnt1/
Pygo2 SSKO mice did not demonstrate any consistent difference in tumor growth upon
transplantation (data not shown).
MMTV-Wnt1-derived tumors are generally adenocarcinomas with heterogeneous cell types
and most of tumor cells can be roughly categorized into a mixture of the following
histological types: papillary/ductal, microaciner (cribriform), and adenosquamous (22).
Distribution of cell types was similar between genotypes, with papillary/ductal and
microaciner types being the majority and no clear difference in the expression pattern of
luminal and basal keratin markers K8 and K14 in well-differentiated papillary/ductal regions
of the tumors (Supplemental Figure 7 and data not shown).

In vivo and in vitro analysis reveals minimal impact of Pygo2 loss on canonical Wnt
signaling in MMTV-Wnt1 mammary cells

Author Manuscript

We next asked whether Pygo2 deletion affects Wnt signaling output in MMTV-Wnt1 MGs..
Specifically, we introduced a commonly used Wnt reporter, the Axin2LacZallele (36), into
the MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2 SSKO mice. Using X-gal staining, we detected similar reporter
activities in whole-mount MMTV-Wnt1 MGs despite whether the Pygo2 gene was intact or
not (Figure 5A). Strong activity was detected in the basal layer as well as in some luminal
cells of both MMTV-Wnt1 and MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2 SSKO MGs (Figure 5A, B). To better
quantify reporter activity, we performed FACS analysis using a fluorescent LacZ substrate
along with antibodies against cell surface antigens (CD24, CD29 and lineage markers)
(Figure 5C). Reporter expression was normally detected in the Lin−CD24+CD29high MaSC/
basal cells but not Lin−CD24+CD29low luminal cells (Figure 5C). In MMTV-Wnt1 MGs,
however, reporter expression was dramatically elevated in the luminal cells to a level
comparable to that in the MaSC/basal cells (Figure 5C). Our finding is consistent with a
recent report detecting Axin2LacZ reporter activity and Axin2 mRNA in both basal and
luminal compartments (37), but contrasts two earlier reports of Wnt activity exclusively in
the MaSC/basal cells of MMTV-Wnt1 MGs (27, 28). This discrepancy may arise from the
use of different detection methods, with the former studies employing quantitative assays
whereas the latter studies relying solely on a histological evaluation of LacZ-positive cells

which might not have been sufficiently sensitive. Importantly, deletion of Pygo2 did not
significantly affect reporter activity in either MaSC/basal or luminal populations of the
MMTV-Wnt1 MGs (Figure 5C).

Author Manuscript

To assess the effect of Pygo2 loss on canonical Wnt signaling in tumor cells, we established
a heterogeneous tumor cell line (G236) from a MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2flox/− mouse (see
Materials and Methods) and examined the effect of Pygo2 deletion on Wnt signaling activity
in these cells. Addition of recombinant Wnt3a protein led to a dose-dependent increase in
signaling activity as assayed by the super-TOP-Flash (LEF/TCF reporter)/FOP (mutated
LEF/TCF reporter) ratio (Figure 5D), indicating that G236 cells are capable of transmitting
Wnt signaling. Loss of Pygo2 upon infection with Cre-expressing adenoviruseses (Ad-Cre;
Ad-GFP was used as a control) (Figure 5E) led to an increase of basal, but decrease of
Wnt3a-stimulated, reporter gene expression (Figure 5D). Overall, although the dose
response curve was less steep than control, Pygo2-deficient cells still responded to Wnt
ligand stimulation. Collectively, these results raise the interesting possibility that Pygo2 acts
in Wnt-induced tumorigenesis via both Wnt-dependent and Wnt-independent mechanisms.
Acute deletion of Pygo2 in pre-existing MMTV-Wnt1 tumor cells results in reduced tumorinitiating frequency and altered lineage potential

Author Manuscript

To test whether Pygo2 regulates the functional cancer stem cell pool, we isolated primary
tumor cells from MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2flox/− mice, infected them with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre, and
monitored the ability of the infected cells to produce tumorspheres in culture and to initiate
tumors upon transplantation onto nude mice (Figure 6A). GFP expression was used to
monitor adenoviral infection efficiency and shown to correlate well with loss of the Pygo2
protein (Supplemental Figure 8A, B). Comparing to Ad-GFP-infected cells (~95% GFPpositive), Ad-Cre-infected cells (~85% GFP-positive; Supplemental Figure 8A) showed
dramatically impaired ability to initiate new tumorspheres upon passaging (Figure 6B).
Moreover, in transplantation experiments, Ad-Cre-infected cells at limiting dilutions showed
greatly reduced tumor take rates comparing to Ad-GFP-infected cells (Figure 6C).
Calculation of tumor-initiating frequency revealed a >10-fold reduction upon acute Pygo2
deletion (Figure 6C).

Author Manuscript

Remarkably, of the 17 tumors derived from Ad-Cre-infected cells in three independent
transplantation experiments, a vast majority (15 out of 17; 88%) contained abundant cells
that expressed Pygo2, even though >80% of the cells were devoid of Pygo2 at the time of
transplantation (Figure 7A, B, Supplemental Figure 8A). Among these, six (35%) tumors,
which showed a well-differentiated ductal/papillary morphology with both basal and luminal
cell constituents, were populated entirely by Pygo2-expressing cells (Figure 7A, left). This
result suggests that Pygo2 expression may confer selective growth advantage to tumorinitiating cells during tumor progression.
Nine (53%) tumors contained a mixture of Pygo2-positive cells (60.2±11.9%, as estimated
by random sampling of 10 “mixed regions” from four different sections) and Pygo2negative cells (Figure 7A, middle, and 7B). A majority of these mixed-type tumors
displayed papillary/ductal-type histology with a few unclassified/undifferentiated regions
(data not shown). The incidence of such mixed-type tumors increased with the increasing

number of transplanted tumor cells (Figure 7C), suggesting that injection of more cells
allowed the generation of polyclonal tumors where both Pygo2-expressing (uninfected) and
Pygo2-deficient (Ad-Cre infected) participated in tumor formation. Interestingly, Pygo2positive and Pygo2-negative cells were often distinctly partitioned into luminal and basal,
respectively, compartments or vice versa (Figure 7D and data not shown), as if they each
arose as clones of lineage-restricted basal or luminal progenitor cells. Again, the abundance
of Pygo2 expression in these tumors suggests the competitive advantage of Pygo2expressing tumor cells in supporting tumor growth. Only in rare cases did we observe
contribution of Pygo2-deficient cells to both basal and luminal cell types within a small
ductal/papillary region, suggesting that tumor-initiating cells may have restricted lineage
potential in the absence of Pygo2.

Author Manuscript

Only 2 (12%) tumors were populated entirely by Pygo2-deficient epithelial cells (Figure
7B). Interestingly, these tumors showed an exclusively microacinar-type histology
(Supplemental Figure 9). In addition, Pygo2-deficient regions in the mixed-type tumors
were frequently found to associate with tumor sub-regions that presented a microacinar
morphology (Figure 7E). These results raise the intriguing possibility that loss of Pygo2
favors tumorigenesis from alveolar progenitor cells, and/or promotes the differentiation of
tumor-initiating cells towards an alveolar fate. Collectively, our findings suggest an
important role for Pygo2 in enabling multipotent stem and lineage-restricted progenitor cells
to initiate new tumors as well as in specifying tumor histology/subtypes.

Author Manuscript

Finally, we tested the effect of pyrvinium, a recently reported compound that blocks
canonical Wnt activity partially through promoting casein kinase 1α activation and
proteasomal degradation of the Pygo2 protein (38). Intraperitoneal administration of 0.5
mg/kg/day pyrvinium pamoate to nude mice, which had been transplanted with the MMTVWnt1 primary tumor cells (Figure 8A), indeed slowed down tumor growth (Figure 8B). We
were not able to test higher doses of pyrvinium pamoate due to its side effects including a
slight, but significant suppression of total body weight (Supplemental Figure 10). This said,
our proof-of-principle data suggest that chemically targeting Pygo2 and its associated Wnt
signaling pathway affects tumor progression in vivo.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

In the current work, we describe for the first time an important role for Pygo2 in Wntinduced mammary tumorigenesis. Chronic and acute deletion of Pygo2 suppressed the onset
and tumor-reinitiating activity of MMTV-Wnt1-induced tumors, respectively. Previous in
vitro studies have shown that siRNA-mediated knockdown of Pygo2 results in decreased
presence of a subpopulation of human breast cancer cells that express cancer stem cell
markers (16). This study presents the first in vivo, functional evidence that Pygo2 regulates
both the initiation and lineage differentiation of mammary tumors.
Our data present new insights into the molecular control of mammary tissue stem/progenitor
cells and the specific roles of Wnt signaling. In contrast to its strong impact on MMTVWnt1-induced tumorigenesis, the effect of Pygo2 loss on Wnt signaling-induced mammary
overgrowth is manifest only in some contexts: the precocious branching and lateral bud

formation in MGs of K14-ΔN-β-catenin females and the abnormal growth of MGs in
MMTV-Wnt1 males are rescued [(15); this work], whereas the extensive ductal
hyperbranching in MGs of MMTV-Wnt1 females is not (this work). It is formally possible
that the different strain backgrounds of the K14-ΔN-β-catenin vs. MMTV-Wnt1 mice used in
our analyses account for such phenotypic difference. This said, we did not observe any
significant difference between a mixed background and pure FVB/N background for the
preneoplastic phenotypes or tumor incidence of MMTV-Wnt1 mice (Figure 4A and data not
shown). Instead, the differential rescue may be explained by a β-catenin/Pygo2-independent
effect of the MMTV-Wnt1 transgene, such as triggering activation of noncanonical Wnt
signaling pathways. In addition, different target populations of active Wnt signaling between
the two models as well as between females and males might account for their different
Pygo2 dependency. Canonical Wnt signaling is activated in basal cells of the K14-ΔN-βcatenin MGs, whereas Wnt-responsive cells are found in both basal and luminal
compartments of the MGs of MMTV-Wnt1 females [(37); this study]. Thus, these Wntresponsive populations do not completely overlap with sites of Pygo2 expression, which
include predominantly luminal cells but also some basal cells. The target population in MGs
of MMTV-Wnt1 males has not been determined in our study. Interestingly, the impaired TEB
formation and transient delay in ductal elongation caused by Pygo2 deletion in wild-type
MGs (15) still occurs in MMTV-Wnt1 MGs. Taken together with the differential effect of
MMTV-Wnt1 and Pygo2 deletion on ductal vs. TEB progenitor cells, these data are
consistent with different subpopulations of progenitor cells being responsible for ductal
branching vs. elongation during mammary development (5, 39). Finally, the loss of Pygo2
might also exert a systemic, non-cell autonomous effect, such as altering sex hormone levels
or modifying specific responses to hormones (40), thereby modifying the Wnt transgenic
phenotypes. Future studies will be needed to further explore these possibilities.

Our data are consistent with Pygo2 acting downstream of the initial expansion of mammary
tissue stem/progenitor cells to facilitate malignant transformation. It is possible that Wnt1
stimulates the self-renewal of the stem/progenitor cells whereas Pygo2 facilitates their
subsequent proliferation which allows tumorigenic mutations to occur and accumulate. The
Pygo2 deficiency-induced alteration in cell cycle gene expression supports this notion. Our
gene expression and reporter analysis of preneoplastic MMTV-Wnt1 MGs revealed little or
no detectable alteration in canonical Wnt signaling upon Pygo2 loss. Moreover, Pygo2 loss
elicits opposite in vitro effects on the basal and activated canonical Wnt signaling in G236
tumor cells. Thus, Pygo2’s action as a chromatin effector (10–15) goes beyond simply
facilitating Wnt signaling, a notion that is consistent with the Pygo2 knockout phenotypes
presented in the current and previous reports (15, 41, 42). Further studies outside the scope
of this work will be needed to identify unknown molecular event(s) that is regulated by
Pygo2.
The relationship between the cell of origin of a particular tumor and its cancer stem cells
remains ill-defined (43). Our study now suggests that they are both under the control of
Pygo2, as Pygo2 loss not only delayed the onset of primary MMTV-Wnt1 tumors, but also
reduced the frequency of tumor-initiating cells in preexisting tumors. In an elegant study of
the gene expression profiles of mammary tumors from various mouse models, tumors from

MMTV-Wnt1 mice were found to fall into two distinct groups (III and IV) that both display
basal/myoepithelial features (44). A main characteristics of the MMTV-Wnt1 tumors, as
uncovered by this and other studies, is the presence of heterogeneous cell types and
expression of both luminal and basal/myoepithelial gene clusters. Interestingly, Pygo2deficient cells were able to contribute to MMTV-Wnt1 tumors with this characteristic
heterogeneity (21, 23) only when Pygo2-expressing cells were also present. On the other
hand, tumors completely devoid of Pygo2-expressing cells lost this heterogeneity and were
predominantly of the microacinar subtype. These data suggest that 1) Pygo2-expressing
tumor cells orchestrate the production of heterogeneous tumors and may exert paracrine
effects on Pygo2-deficient cells to modify their behavior; 2) Pygo2-deficient tumorinitiating cells when standing alone are more restricted in their lineage differentiation
potential and can only, for example, serve as alveolar progenitor cells. Along this line, it is
intriguing to speculate that the presence of Pygo2 may promote the lineage plasticity of
cancer stem cells (45), a notion worthy of future investigation.
In contrast to findings from transplantation studies where Pygo2 was acutely deleted, we did
not observe any obvious lineage restriction of Pygo2-null tumor cells in the chronic deletion
model. This discrepancy may be explained by possible additional genetic mutations or
epigenetic alterations that occur in the chronic model, yielding compensatory and/or
alternative molecular mechanisms that allow Pygo2-independent tumor growth. In the acute
deletion-transplantation model, there may not be sufficient time to allow such adaptive
changes to occur, hence allowing the manifestation of a dependence of the resulting tumors
on Pygo2 for their initiation and maintenance.

In our study, Pygo2 deletion exerts a significant effect on tumorigenesis in the MMTVWnt1 animal model, extending the 50% tumor-free survival by 267 days. This length of time
represents 37% of the typical life span of laboratory mice, which is about 2 years. Thus, it is
reasonable to consider the Pygo2-related pathway as a possible candidate for targeted
therapeutics in breast cancer prevention and treatment. Further supporting this notion, Pygo2
loss has a remarkable effect on tumorigenesis in the acute deletion-transplantation model,
both by reducing the frequency of the tumor initiating cells, and by altering their lineage
differentiation potential. Thus, it might be of interest to explore the targeting of Pygo2
expression or function as adjuvant, “differentiation” therapeutics to promote the
differentiation of breast cancer stem cells, which are proposed to be responsible for cancer
recurrence and relapse (2). Although pyrvinium treatment can cause a significant reduction
in tumor growth in the MMTV-Wnt1 model, the effectiveness of the drug is limited because
of side effects. Thus, identification and generation of more specific and less toxic
compounds may be necessary to pursue the potential therapeutic effect of inhibiting Pygo2
and its associated Wnt signaling pathway in vivo.

in an FVB/N and C57BL/6-mixed background (62.5% FVB/N and 37.5% B6 for MMTVWnt1/Pygo2 SSKO; 56.25% FVB/N and 43.75% B6 for Axin2LacZ/+/MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2
SSKO) by crossing Axin2LacZ/+/MMTV-Wnt1/K14-Cre/Pygo2+/− males with Pygo2flox/flox
females. Tumor-free survival for MMTV-Wnt1 mice in this mixed background was similar to
that in a pure FVB/N background (20) (Figure 4A and data not shown). All experiments
have been approved by and conform to the regulatory guidelines of the International Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Irvine.
Morphology, immunostaining and Western blot analysis

Author Manuscript

For whole-mount MG staining, MGs (#3 or #4) were dissected, fixed overnight in Carnoy’s
solution (60% ethanol, 30% chloroform, and 10% glacial acetic acid), and stained with
carmine alum as previously described (15). X-gal staining was performed as previously
described (37). For histological analysis, MGs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with
hemotoxylin and eosin (H/E).

Immunohistochemical detection of Pygo2 (46), K8 (rat; 1:1000; Developmental Studies
Hybridoma Bank), K19 (rat; 1:1000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), K5 (rabbit
1:1000), K6 (rabbit; 1:1000), K14 (rabbit; 1:2,000) (K5, K6 and K14 antibodies were gifts
from J. Segre, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), Ki67 (Vector Laboratories, VPK451; 1:500) was performed with paraformaldehyde-fixed OCT sections, using Vector ABC
(Vector Laboratories, PK-6100) and DAB (DAKO, K3468) kits according to manufacturers’
recommendations. Antigen-retrieval was performed by incubating slides in Tris-EDTA
buffer (pH 9.0) in microwave for 20 min. Indirect immunofluorescence of K8, K19, K5, K6,
and K14 was performed as previously described (47). Western blot analysis was performed
as previously described (15) using antibodies including anti-Pygo2 (46) and anti-β-actin
(Sigma). Proteins were collected from the isolated mammary cell pellets as described in
FACS analysis (see below). Blots were subjected to densitmetric analysis using the Multi
Gauge V3.0 software (Fujifilm). Pygo2 levels were normalized against β-actin levels and
further corrected for the epithelial contents as revealed by FACS analysis (Supplemental
Figure 1).
FACS analysis and live cell sorting

Author Manuscript

MGs (#3–5) or tumors were surgically isolated form adjacent tissues, minced into 1 mm
fractions and digested for 2–4 h at 37°C in DMEM/F12 containing 5% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 300 U/ml collagenase (Sigma Aldrich), and 100 U/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich)
with shaking at 200 rpm. After vortexing and lysis of the red blood cells in ammonium
chloride, a single-cell suspension was obtained by sequential dissociation of the fragments
by gentle pipetting for 2 min in 0.25% trypsin and then for 2 min in 5 mg/ml dispase II
(STEMCELL Technologies Inc.) plus 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma Aldrich) followed by
filtration through a 40-mm mesh. For all mammary cell isolations, viable cells were counted
on a hemacytometer using Trypan blue exclusion.

Staining was performed using the following antibodies and reagents: allophycocyanin
(APC)-labeled anti-CD31 (BD), APC-labeled anti-CD45 (BD), APC-labeled anti-TER119
(BD), phycoerythrin (PE)/Cy7-labeled anti-CD24 (BD), FITC or PE-labeled anti-CD29
(BioLegened), PE-labeled anti-CD61 (BioLegend). Detection of LacZ activity using the
fluorescent substrate di-D-β-galactopyranoside (FDG) was as described (48), with cells costained by PE/Cy7-labeled anti-CD24, PE-labeled anti-CD29, and APC-labeled lineage
markers (CD31, CD45 and TER119). Cells were acquired on FACSCalibur (BD), and
analysis was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.). Live cell sorting was performed on a
BD FACSAria equipped with FACS DiVa6.0 software operating at low pressure (20 psi)
using a 100-μm nozzle. Cells were routinely double sorted and post-sort analysis typically
indicated purities of >90% with minimal cell death (<10%).
RNA isolation and microarray analysis

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated from freshly sorted Lin−CD24+CD29high MaSC/basal cells using
the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Hybridization of arrays (GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST,
901086, Affymetrix) was performed at the UCI Genomics High Throughput Facility
(GHTF). Two biological replicates were performed for pooled RNA from at least 3 mice per
genotype. Genes with normalized expression levels over detection threshold were called and
analyzed for differential expression using the Cyber-T program (http://cybert.ics.uci.edu/).
GSEA was performed using a Web-based tool (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea) based on
previous publications (49).
Reverse-transcription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)

Author Manuscript

cDNA was prepared using Retroscript high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
(4368814, Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR
was performed using a CFX96 qPCR system and SsoAdvanced SYBR Green supermix
(Bio-rad). Primers used for gene expression analysis are: Pygo2, forward 5′aggcagcccctctacttagc-3′, reverse 5′-ccaacccactttcttccaaa-3′ and Gapdh, forward 5′aatgtgtccgtcgtggatct-3′, reverse 5′-ccctgttgctgtagccgtat-3′.
Acute deletion of Pygo2
Adenoviral transduction of Cre-recombinase was performed as described previously (50).
Freshly isolated tumor cells from MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2flox/− mice were incubated in
suspension with control adenoviruses [Ad-IRES-GFP (Ad-GFP), Vector Biolab] or
adenoviruses expressing Cre recombinase [Ad-Cre-IRES-GFP (Ad-Cre), Vector Biolab] at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were then washed with PBS
and used immediately for tumorsphere culture or transplantation.

Serial dilution transplantation
After adenoviral infection, tumor cells were counted and resuspended in a 1:1 solution of
PBS/Matrigel (BD). Ten μl each of limiting dilutions of control and experimental cells were
injected into contralateral fat pads of #4 MGs of 6–8-week old athymic NCr-nu/nu mice
(NU/J, Jackson Laboratory) that were anesthetized by an i.p. injection of ketamine and
xylazine (750 and 50 mg/kg body weight, respectively). Tumor development was monitored

for up to 4 months after transplantation. Statistical analysis of the take rate was performed
using the ELDA Web-based tool (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/) (51).
Tumorsphere assay
Tumorsphere assay was performed as previously described (52). After adenoviral infection,
5 × 104 tumor cells were seeded onto 24-well Ultra Low Attachment plates (Corning,
Corning, NY) in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 ng/mL EGF, 40 ng/mL
FGF-2, 5 μg/mL insulin, 0.5 μg/mL hydrocortisone, B27 (Invitrogen) and 4 ng/mL heparin.
Tumorspheres were passaged every 7 days by mechanistically disaggregating with a 23gauge needle followed by digestion with 0.25% trypsin for 3 min at 37°C. Five thousand
cells were seeded for the second and third passages. Tumor spheres larger than 50 μm in
diameter were counted.

Establishment of an MMTV-Wnt1 tumor cell line (G236) and luciferase assay
G236 tumor cell line was established as a bulk population of tumor cells from a MMTVWnt1/Pygo2flox/− mouse using previously described method (53), and maintained in
DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 20 ng/mL EGF, insulin and
hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich). G236 culture includes heterogeneous cell subpopulations
and expresses both basal and luminal markers (data not shown).

Author Manuscript

For luciferase assay, G236 cells in 24-well plates were treated with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre (see
above) and transiently transfected with the SuperTOP/FOP-Flash constructs (200 ng/well).
β-actin-LacZ (10 ng/well) was included as a transfection control. Wnt3a recombinant protein
(R&D Systems, 5036-WN/CF) was added four hours after transfection. Cells were harvested
24 hours after the addition of Wnt3a, and luciferase activity was measured in whole cell
extracts using the luciferase assay system (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured
as previously described (54).

was performed by densitometric analysis of Western blots (inset shows a representative
example) of lysates prepared from MMTV-Wnt1 (n=2) and control littermates (n=2) (6–7
month old). Values were normalized against β-actin, and were corrected for differences in
the epithelial content of tissues of the indicated genotypes (See Supplemental Figure 1). In
both (A) and (B), means ± standard deviations are shown. (C–D) Immunohistochemical (C)
and indirect immunofluorescent (D) analysis of Pygo2 protein expression in tissues of the
indicated genotypes. Antibody specificity was indicated by lack of signals in MGs from
skin/mammary-specific Pygo2 knockout (SSKO) mice (see below) that carry the MMTVWnt1 transgene. Section in (D) was double-stained using Pygo2 (green) and K14 (red)

(A–B) X-gal staining of MGs from Axin2LacZ/+/MMTV-Wnt1 and Axin2LacZ/+/MMTV-Wnt1/
Pygo2 SSKO littermates. Images of whole mount staining (A) and histological sections (B)
are shown. Nuclei were counter stained with Nuclear Fast Red in (B). Arrows and
arrowheads indicate LacZ-positive cells in basal and luminal layers, respectively. Scale bar
= 20 μm. (C) FACS analysis of LacZ activity in epithelial subpopulations from Axin2LacZ/+/
MMTV-Wnt1 and Axin2LacZ/+/MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2 SSKO littermates. LacZ activity was
detected using a fluorescent LacZ substrate (FDG), and the percentages of LacZ-positive
cells in the indicated mammary subpopulations (visualized based on surface marker
expression) are shown. (D) Pygo2 modulates TOP-Flash response of G236 cells to
recombinant Wnt3a. TOP-Flash reporter activity was measured 24 hours after the addition
of recombinant Wnt3a at the indicated concentrations to control (Ad-GFP) and Pygo2deficient (Ad-Cre) G236 cells. Means ± standard deviations of a triplicate experiment are
shown. Similar results were obtained from two independent experiments. (E) Pygo2 protein

tumor cells

(A) Experimental strategy. Mammary tumor cells were freshly isolated from tumor-bearing
MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2flox/− mice and infected with the indicated adenoviruses right before
tumorsphere or transplantation assays. Adenovirus infection efficiency was >80% (see text
for details). (B) Reduced number of tumorsphere-initiating cells upon acute Pygo2 deletion.
Tumorspheres were passaged every 7 days. The chart represents the percentages of cells that
generate tumorspheres in total cells based on the assumption that all tumorspheres generated
have a clonal origin. Uninfected control was included to exclude the adverse effect of
adenoviruses. p values were calculated from five replicates. Similar results were obtained
using two independent tumors. (C–D) Estimated tumor-initiating frequency after Ad-GFP or
Ad-Cre infection of MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2flox/− primary tumor cells. Results from three
independent serial dilution (ranging from 400–20,000 cells/infection) transplantation
experiments using three MMTV-Wnt1/Pygo2flox/− primary tumors are summarized in (C)
and a graphic representation of the estimated tumor-initiating cell frequency is shown in (D).

Figure 7. Competitive advantage of Pygo2-expressing cells and skewed lineage differentiation of
Pygo2-deficient cells during tumor formation after transplantation

Author Manuscript

(A) Immunohistochemical analysis of Pygo2 expression in the transplanted tumors after
Ade-Cre-mediated acute deletion of Pygo2 (see Figure 6 for details). Representative images
of Ad-Cre-treated tumor tissues are shown for tumors that contain only Pygo2-expressing
cells (“All”), a mixture of Pygo2-expressing and Pygo2-deficient cells (“Mixed”), or no
Pygo2-expressing tumor cells (“None”). Green arrowheads indicate Pygo2-positive stromal
cells. (B) Quantification of the percentages of “None”, “Mixed”, and “All” types of tumors.
Note that as a control, Ad-GFP-infected tumor cells produced only “All”-type tumors. (C)
Dependence of tumor type on the number of transplanted tumor cells. Percentages of
“None”, “Mixed”, and “All” types of tumors were quantified for the indicated numbers of
Ade-Cre-treated, transplanted cells. (D) A representative “Mixed”-type tumor derived from
Ad-Cre-infected tumor cells showing segregation of Pygo2-expressing and Pygo2-deficient
cells in luminal and basal, respectively, compartments. Arrows and arrowheads indicate
luminal (K8+) and basal (K5+), respectively, cells on serial sections. (E) Pygo2-deficient
cells populate a microacinar section of a “Mixed”-type tumor derived from Ad-Cre-infected
tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the indicated antibodies on serial
sections. Scale bars in (A), (D), (E) = 20 μm.

Author Manuscript

(A) Experimental strategy. Single cell suspension was prepared from a primary tumor from
a MMTV-Wnt1 mouse and 1×105 tumor cells were bilaterally injected into #4 MGs of nude
mice (D0). Mice were administered daily with pyrvinium phosphate (0.5 mg/kg) via
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection beginning at a day after transplantation (D1) and continued
daily for 21 days (D1–D21) (n=10 recipient mice per condition). (B) Tumor growth curve.
Tumor volume was estimated from the maximum and minimum diameters measured every 3
days by a caliper. Saline injection was performed as a control treatment.
