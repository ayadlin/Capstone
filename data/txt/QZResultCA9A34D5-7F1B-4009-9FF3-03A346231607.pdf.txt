BACKGROUND: Aurora-A/STK15 is a serine/threonine kinase critical for regulated chromosome segregation and
cytokinesis. We investigated the association between 2 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the
coding region of STK15, T91A (Phe31Ile) and G169A (Val57Ile), and clinical outcome of esophageal cancer treated
with preoperative chemoradiation. METHODS: Genotypes at Phe31Ile and Val57Ile were assessed from peripheral
blood lymphocytes of 190 esophageal cancer patients and were correlated to response to treatment, recurrence rate,
risk of death, disease-free survival (DFS) and median survival time (MTS). RESULTS: All patients had resectable
esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer and received preoperative chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy. The heterozygous variant Phe31/Ile variant was significantly associated with tumor recurrence (odds ratio [OR]
¼ 4.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.12-8.94; P < .001), shorter DFS (P ¼ .0001), and shorter MTS (P ¼ .012). For
patients receiving cisplatin-based therapy, only the variant Phe31/Ile had an adverse effect on response (OR ¼ 2.8;
95% CI, 1.01-5.17; P ¼ .048) and MTS (P ¼ .026). The variant 91A-169G haplotype carried a significant risk for lack of
complete response (OR ¼ 2.54; 95% CI, 1.15-5.54) and higher rate of recurrence (OR ¼ 2.73; 95%CI, 1.00-7.29). The
presence of at least 1 variant allele at each locus further increased the risk of recurrence (adjusted OR ¼ 6.21; 95% CI,
2.28-17.11; P ¼ <.001), and was associated significantly shorter DFS (P ¼ .003). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows
that functional SNPs in the STK15 gene are associated with higher rate of recurrence, higher likelihood of chemoratiotherapy-resistance, shorter DFS, and shorter MTS. Confirmation of our data and understanding the mechanisms
through which STK15 functional SNPs mediate resistance to chemoradiotherapy are warranted. Cancer 2012;118:4346C 2011 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Carcinoma of the esophagus or and gastroesophageal junction (E/GEJC) remains a highly virulent malignancy,
with approximately 16,980 new cases and 14,710 deaths expected in the United states in 2011.1 E/GEJC is 1 of the few
cancers that have exhibited a dramatic increase in incidence with more than 400% increase in its rate in 25 years accompanied by 8% in the death rate in 13 years 1990 to 2003.2 Despite aggressive therapeutic multidisciplinary approaches, the
5-year survival rate of E/GEJC is <20%.3
For patients with localized E/GEJC, representing about 50% of all patients at diagnosis, a commonly recommended
approach is preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CTXRT) followed by surgical resection, although primary resection
remains an option.4–11
The current preoperative treatment regimens are associated with substantial morbidity and benefit only a limited
group of patients. Level 1 evidence for preoperative CTXRT has not been published because of equivocal results from

several randomized trials. It is, however, clear that patients
who have a highly CTXRT sensitive cancer (eg, when no
cancer cells or only a few cancer cells are identified in the
resected specimen) tend to survive better than those who
have relatively resistant cancer.12–16
Unfortunately, the majority of E/GEJC are resistant
to currently utilized CTXRT. Clearly, it would be important to identifying factors that mediate chemoradiation
resistance and metastatic progression. Unfortunately, pretreatment clinical parameters, such as age, sex, histology,
or location of the primary cancer, clinical stage (whether
II, III, or IVA), imaging studies, do not predict the outcome and the identification of genetic and molecular
biomarkers to optimize therapy is warranted.
Aurora A, also known as STK15, BTAK, AIKI, and
AURKA in humans, belongs to a multigenic family of mitotic serine/threonine kinases including 2 other members,
Aurora-B and Aurora-C.17 STK15 is an oncogene located
on chromosome 20q13, a region frequently amplified in a
variety of human neoplasia, including esophageal cancers.17 In physiological conditions, the Aurora-A protein
is expressed and active at the highest level during the G2M phase of the cell cycle and falls again during the exit
from mitosis into the next G1.18-20 Aurora-A localizes at
the centrosomes of interphase cells, and becomes phophorylated and activated in the centrosomes late in the
G2 phase.20 Aurora-A is necessary for the recruitment of
proteins required for spindle formation and centrosome
maturation process, such as TACC, Kinesin 5, and
c-tubulins.17 In addition, Aurora-A also plays key roles in
the organization and alignment of chromosomes, as well
as the exit from mitosis and proper cytokinesis. Aurora-A
activation is inhibited by the late G2 DNA damage checkpoint, although its sustained expression abrogate the
G2-M DNA damage checkpoint resulting in the inappropriate commitment to mitosis, and further promoting
genomic instability.21 Aurora-A elevated expression, with
or without gene amplification, has been reported in a
variety of human cancers, and has been correlated with
chromosomal instability and clinical aggressiveness.17
Two coding single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in the STK15 gene have been reported to fall
within in the NH-2 terminal region of the Aurora-A protein and have been associated with functional consequences.22-27 The T91A SNP, which causes an amino acid
change at codon 31 from phenylalanine to an isoleucin,
was initially associated with enhanced cell transformation
in vitro and significantly increased chromosomal instability in human colon cancers.23 Several studies, including a

Cancer

meta-analysis, suggested that the T91A polymorphism is
associated with low penetrance cancer susceptibility
affecting multiple cancers types, including esophageal
cancer;27 it can lead to earlier ages of diagnosis in pancreatic cancer, and may have synergistic effects with other
genes.22 However, the 91A allele has also been shown to
yield protective effects, such as in patients with hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).22 The second
functional SNP, the G169A at codon 57, causes an amino
acid change from valine to an isoleucine, and reduces
Aurora-A kinase activity.23 The T91A and G169A
haplotype combinations (91A-169A; T91-169A) have
been shown to be significantly associated with esophageal
cancer risk.
Regulated Aurora-A is critical for maintenance of
genomic integrity after DNA damage and the STK15
SNPs disrupt some physiologic functions of Aurora-A;
therefore, we hypothesized that the STK T91A and
G169A SNPs would mediate CTXRT resistance and lead
to adverse outcomes in patients with E/GEJC. We discuss
our results in 190 patients in whom we studied STK15
T91A and G169A.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This study included 190 histologically confirmed esophageal cancer patients who consented for research blood
collection and were recruited between 1985 and 2003 at
the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
(Houston, Tx). These patients were diagnosed had potentially resectable adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction and
had received chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery or
induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy
and surgery.
Clinical Data Collection
Patients were evaluated by computed tomography, barium-swallow esophagogram, endoscopic ultrasound, and
positron emission tomography (when feasible). Chemotherapeutic agents used were: platinum analogs, fluoropyrimidines, and taxanes. The recommended dose of
radiotherapy was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Approximately
5 to 6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy,
patients underwent surgical resection. The resected specimens were reviewed systematically to assess the degree of
residual cancer and lymph nodal involvement.15 All participants voluntarily donated blood for research after an

STK15 Genotyping
Genomic DNA extracted using the PicoPure DNA
extraction kit (Arcturus Bioscience, Mountain View,
Calif). Genotyping was performed using the Taqman
SNP assay. Probes were labeled fluorescently with either
6-FAM or VIC on the 50 end and a nonfluorescent minor
groove binder (MGB) quencher on the 30 end (Applied
Biosystems, Bedford, Mass). The primer and probe
sequences used were as follows: for Phe31Ile, 50 -CTG
GCC ACT ATT TAC AGG TAA TGG A (forward
primer), 50 -TGG AGG TCC AAA ACG TGT TCT C
(reverse primer), VIC-ACT CAG CAA TTT CCT
T-MGB (T allele for Phe), 6-FAM-CTC AGC AAA
TTC CTT-MGB (A allele for Ile); for Val57Ile, 50 -CGG
CTT GTG ACT GGA GAC A (forward primer),
50 -GGG TCT TGT GTC CTT CAA ATT CTT C
(reverse primer), 6-FAM-CAG CGC GTT CCT
T-MGB (G allele for Val), VIC-CAG CGC ATT CCT
T- MGB (A allele for Ile). Typical amplification mixes
(5 lL) contained sample DNA (5 ng), 1 TaqMan PCR
buffer A, 200 lM dNTPs, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.65 units of
AmpliTaq Gold, 900 nM each primer and 200 mM each
probe. Reactions were carried out on a dual-384-well
GeneAmp PCR system 9700, with thermal conditions
being 95 C for 10 minutes, followed by 50 cycles of 95 C
for 15 seconds and 62 C (for Phe31Ile) or 60 C (for
Val57Ile) for 1 minute. Reaction plates were then read
with the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System,
with analyzed fluorescence results auto-called into genotypes using SDS version 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). Water control, previously genotyped samples, and
internal controls of 5% of the samples were randomly
selected and run in duplicates with 100% concordance.
Statistical Analysis
The Fisher and chi-square tests were used to assess the
association between recurrence/survival and demographics, clinical variables, and treatments. We set the
study endpoint event as the date of the patient’s first
recurrence or overall death and applied the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs)
associated with the Phe31Ile and Val57Ile polymorphisms. The outcome variables for patients lost to followup or those who experienced recurrence or death after the
end of the study were flagged as censored.

4348

HRs were estimated by fitting the Cox model while
adjusting for age, gender, radiation dosage, CTXRT
sequence, clinical stage, chemoregimens, histology, tumor
location, pathology, and histological viability. KaplanMeier survival function and log-rank tests were used to
assess clinical outcomes in relation to the polymorphisms.
The above statistical analyses were completed with the
STATA software (Version 8, College Station, Tx).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The median age of the 190 patients was 61 years (range,
32-78 years). There were 165 men (86.8%) and 25
women (13.2%). All patients were Caucasians. Histology
distribution included 85.3% adenocarcinoma (162
patients) and 14.7% squamous cell carcinoma (28
patients). Clinical stage distribution was as follows: stage
IIA or IIB in 57.4%, stage III in 37.4%, and stage IVA in
5.2%. Induction chemotherapy followed by CTXRT was
given to 81 patients (42%), with the remaining 109
patients (58%) receiving only preoperative CTXRT. The
distribution for chemotherapeutic treatments was: cisplatin in 136 (71.6%) patients, fluoropyrimidine in 181
(95.3%) patients, and taxane in 97 (51.0%) patients.
Pathologic complete response (absence of residual
cancer cells, pathCR) was observed in 64 (33.7%)
patients, with the remaining 126 (66.3%) had less than a
pathCR. At the median follow-up time of 18.7 months
(range, 0.23-178.43 months), 60 (31.6%) of the 190
patients had local-regional or distant relapse. The overall
survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 47.9% and 34.4%,
respectively, with a median overall survival at 33.6 months
(95% CI: 22.9,47.3). There was no association was found
between preoperative clinical variables (ie, age, gender,
histology, tumor location, clinical stage, radiation dosage,
chemoradiotherapy sequence, chemoregimens) and
patient outcomes (median survival, disease-free survival
[DFS], rate of relapse, overall survival, or response to
CTXRT). These results were similar to our previous published clinical studies.14,15
Effect of Preoperative CTXRT on Response
and Survival
The schedule of preoperative treatment (eg, induction
chemotherapy [CT] followed by concomitant CTXRT vs
CTXRT alone) nor the class of chemotherapeutic agents
was associated with pathological response or survivals.
However, a difference in clinical outcome was associated

Seventy-three (57%) of the 128 patients who received >45
Gy were alive compared with 22 (37.2%) of the 59 patients
who received <45 Gy (P ¼ .012). Similarly, local-regional
relapse was reduced when the recommended dose of radiation could be administered (P ¼ .025).
STK15 Genotype Characteristics
The frequencies for the Phe31Ile (T91A) SNP were
71.8% for the Phe allele and 28.2% for Ile allele. For the
Val57Ile SNP, frequencies for the Val and Ile alleles were
86.4% and 13.6%, respectively.
Effects of Individual STK15 Polymorphisms
on Response and Clinical Outcomes
Table 1a illustrates the association between STK15-T91A
SNP and response to CTXRT, recurrence rate, and survivals. The T91A SNP was not associated with response
to CTXRT. Compared with patients carrying the wildtype TT genotypes (Phe/Phe), patients with the heterozygous variant AT genotype (Phe31/Ile) were at significantly
increased risk of tumor relapse with an adjusted odds ratio
(OR) of 4.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.12-8.94)
(P < .001). There was no association for the homozygous
variant AA genotype (Ile/Ile) with risk of relapse; however,

there was a significant association of combined variant alleles (AT þ AA) with risk of relapse with an adjusted OR
of 3.73 (95%CI, 2.12-8.94) (P ¼ .016). Kaplan-Meier
estimates demonstrated that both variant allele and combined variant alleles were associated with significantly
shorter DFS compared with the wild-type allele (AT: 12.2
months, AT þ AA: 12.63 months vs TT: 42.17 months;
P ¼ .0001 and 0.0006, respectively). Although the
STK15-T91A SNP was not significantly associated with
risk of death, the median survival time (MTS) of patients
carrying 1 copy of the Phe31Ile allele was significantly
shorter than in patients with the wild-type genotype
(MTS, TA: 22.5 months vs TT: 51.3 months; P ¼ .012).
The STK15 Val57Ile polymorphism did not have
an effect on clinical outcome (Table 1b).

(AT) carried a 2.28-fold (95%CI, 1.01-5.17) higher
risk of lacking response than patients with homozygous
wild-type genotype (P ¼ .048). Similarly, combined variant alleles were significantly associated with lack of
response to CTXRT with an adjusted OR of 2.15
(95%CI, 0.98-4.75; P ¼ .047). In addition, heterozygous
Phe31Ile variant genotype and combined variant alleles
(AT þ AA) were significantly associated with increased
risk of relapse (AT OR ¼ 3.76; 95% CI, 1.62-8.70;
P ¼ .002; AT þ AA OR ¼ 3.42; 95% CI, 1.48-7.96;
P ¼ .044).
Both AT genotype combined AT þ AA genotypes
were associated with significantly shorter DFS (AT: 12.2
months, AT þ AA: 12.4 months) compared with the TT
wild-type genotype group (DFS: 35.67 months; P ¼ .003
and 0.008, respectively). Intriguingly, only the variant
Phe31/Ile allele was associated with shorter median
survival time (MTS: 20.67 months) compared with the
wild-type Phe31/Phe31 allele (MTS: 34.8; P ¼ .026) but
the combined variant allele was not (P ¼ .13). The
Val57Ile polymorphism alone was not significantly associated with risk of response to CTXRT, relapse, or death in
the cisplatin-treated group (Table 2b).

STK15 Haplotypes and Clinical Outcome
There were 4 possible STK15 haplotypes derived from
the 2 known genotypes (ie, 91T-169G, 91A-169G, 91T169A, and 91A-169A). Because both 91T and 169G
wild-types were favorable alleles we used the 91T-169G
haplotype as the reference. As shown in Table 3, compared with the reference, only the variant 91A-169G haplotype carried a significant risk for lack of complete
response (adjusted OR ¼ 2.53; 95% CI, 1.15-5.54) and
recurrence (adjusted OR ¼ 4.39; 95%CI, 2.16-8.94).
None of the other haplotypes was significantly associated
with clinical outcome.

Figure 1. This shows Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival estimates by joint effects of STK15 polymorphisms at Ile31 and
Val57 loci for patients with esophageal cancer treated by
preoperative chemoradiation therapy.

presence of at least 1 variant allele at each locus further
increased the risk of relapse (adjusted OR ¼ 6.21; 95%
CI, 2.28-17.11; P ¼ <.001). The Kaplan-Meier estimates
demonstrated that patients with at least 1 variant allele at
the Ile31 and Val57 loci had a significantly shorter disease-free survival time of 12.63 months than patients in
the reference genotype group (DFS ¼ 42.17; P ¼ .003)
(Fig. 1). None of the other groups were significantly
associated with esophageal cancer outcome (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
This is the first study to investigate the association
between STK15 functional polymorphisms and outcome
in patients with esophageal cancer treated with preoperative CTXRT. The 3 major findings of this study are that:
1) the heterozygous variant allele of the Phe31Ile is associated with significantly higher risk of tumor relapse and
shorter DFS after preoperative CTXRT, 2) the increasing
number of variant alleles at both loci doubles the risk of
relapse, and 3) the variant Phe31/Ile alone has an impact
on the response to CTXRT, relapse rate, DFS, and median
survival in patients receiving cisplatin-based CTXRT.
STK15 has been linked to tumor development and
progression through it amplification and/or overexpression in a variety of human cancers, including colon, bladder, breast, ovarian, liver, pancreas, gastric and lung.17
STK15 has been reported to interact and phosphorylate
several important proteins involved in stress response and
cell cycle checkpoint after DNA damage.19 It has been
also shown that aberrant expression of STK15 leads to
deregulation of proteins mediating DNA damage
response, such as BRCA1, p53, and CDC25B.19 Overexpression of STK15 leads to diminished transcriptional

activity and increased degradation of p53, causing checkpoint defects and genetic instability and ultimately facilitating cancer development and progression. The Phe31Ile
SNP is of special interest since Ewart-Toand et al20
showed that the variant allele (Ile) was more oncogenic
than the wild-type Phe31, was preferentially amplified,
and associated with aneuploidy in human cancers. In our
study the variant Ile imparted the strongest risk of adverse
outcome with increased recurrence rate and shortest DFS.
One possible functional explanation is that esophageal
cancers developing in a STK15 variant Ile background
harbor enhanced genomic instability and increased clonal
diversity more likely to lead to the generation of clones capable of invasion and metastasis.
Several Previous Studies of the Val5

A inhibitors to improve the clinical outcome in esophageal cancer.
In summary, we found that in esophageal cancer
patients undergoing preoperative CTXRT, the heterozygous STK15-Ile31 variant is associated with increased rate
of relapse and shorter DFS. In particular, for patients who
were treated with cisplatin-based combination, it was
associated with poor response to CTXRT and shorter
survival. Phe31Ile and Val57Ile variant produce an allele
dependent cumulative adverse effect on relapse rate and
DFS. Our data suggest that these STK15 functional SNPs
may modify the effects of preoperative CTXRT in esophageal cancer. Confirmation of our data in a larger cohort
and understanding the molecular mechanisms through
which STK15 functional SNPs mediate resistance to
CTXRT are necessary.

Val57Ile

Several previous studies of the Val57Ile polymorphism and cancer risk did not find significant associations.22-27 Our data suggest that although alone the
Val57Ile SNP is not associated with clinical biology, the
presence of the Ile variant allele enhances the adverse effect
of the adverse effect of the Phe31Ile variant. In vitro, the
combination of variant Phe31Ile and Val57Ile significantly reduces Aurora-A kinase activity (to 15% compared with the wild type) and most importantly induces
abnormal nuclear morphology and genomic instability in
human immortalized fibroblasts. This evidence underscores the biological plausibility of our results.
The strengths of our study include the relatively
large sample size considering the targeted population, and
a homogenous Caucasian population, thus reducing the
risk of confounding by population stratification. The limitations of our study include the hospital-based study
design with which we could not exclude the possibility of
selections bias. In addition, even though our study is of
fairly large size considering the targeted population, it is
underpowered for some stratified analyses, such as the
effects of the STK15 SNPs on the clinical outcome of
patients treated with taxanes-based therapy. Because of
the critical role of Aurora-A in microtubules depending
functions, such as centrosome maturation, spindle formation, and cytokinesis, it would be of interest to investigate
the effects of thee functional SNPs on microtubules targeting drugs. Further studies are needed to confirm these
observations, and to characterize the mechanisms by
which these variant differentially modify esophageal cancer outcome. A better understanding of the functional
value of these allelic variant may lead to the use of Aurora-
