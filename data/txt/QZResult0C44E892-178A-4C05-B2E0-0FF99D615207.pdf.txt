Abstract
A better understanding of drug resistance mechanisms is
required to improve outcomes in patients with pancreatic
cancer. Here, we characterized patterns of sensitivity and
resistance to three conventional chemotherapeutic agents
with divergent mechanisms of action [gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cisplatin] in pancreatic cancer cells. Four
(L3.6pl, BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, and SU86.86) were sensitive and
five (PANC-1, Hs766T, AsPC-1, MIAPaCa-2, and MPanc96)
were resistant to all three agents based on GI50 (50% growth
inhibition). Gene expression profiling and unsupervised
hierarchical clustering revealed that the sensitive and resistant cells formed two distinct groups and differed in
expression of specific genes, including several features of
‘‘epithelial to mesenchymal transition’’ (EMT). Interestingly,
an inverse correlation between E-cadherin and its transcriptional suppressor, Zeb-1, was observed in the gene expression
data and was confirmed by real-time PCR. Independent
validation experiment using five new pancreatic cancer cell
lines confirmed that an inverse correlation between Ecadherin and Zeb-1 correlated closely with resistance to
gemcitabine, 5-FU, and cisplatin. Silencing Zeb-1 in the
mesenchymal lines not only increased the expression of Ecadherin but also other epithelial markers, such as EVA1 and
MAL2, and restored drug sensitivity. Importantly, immunohistochemical analysis of E-cadherin and Zeb-1 in primary
tumors confirmed that expression of the two proteins was
mutually exclusive (P = 0.012). Therefore, our results suggest
that Zeb-1 and other regulators of EMT may maintain drug
resistance in human pancreatic cancer cells, and therapeutic
strategies to inhibit Zeb-1 and reverse EMT should be
evaluated. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5820–8]

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the
United States (American Cancer Society, 2007). Due to a lack of early
detection methods and an absence of effective biomarkers, patients
are usually diagnosed at a late stage with a five-year survival rate of
<5%. Unfortunately, there remains no effective therapy available to
treat this aggressive tumor. Although most chemotherapy regimens

use gemcitabine as the clinical standard of care for pancreatic cancer,
patients generally have limited response to this therapy. Combination
therapy and targeted therapies have also been overall quite
disappointing. Thus, a better global understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying drug resistance in pancreatic cancer may
lead to the development of more effective therapeutic interventions.
Gene expression profiling has been used to identify biomarkers
and therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer (1, 2). In addition,
identification of genes related to chemosensitivity in pancreatic
cancer has been performed in an attempt to improve the efficacy
of pancreatic cancer therapy, and several different biomarkers,
including S100A4, S100P, BNIP3, Cox-2, and periostin, have been
advanced as therapeutic targets (3–7). However, although there is
an impression that pancreatic cancers tend to be cross-resistant to
a large variety of cancer therapies, a mechanistic understanding of
drug resistance has not been obtained.
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental
process that seems to play an important role in tumor progression
and metastasis in diverse solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer
(8, 9). The EMT phenotype is characterized by the loss of cell-to-cell
adhesion with the disintegration of tight, adherens, and gap
junctions and a phenotypic change from an ‘‘epithelial’’ morphology
to a motile, fibroblast-like morphology (10, 11). The hallmark
of EMT is loss of the epithelial homotypic adhesion molecule
E-cadherin and gain of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin
and/or fibronectin. Suppression of E-cadherin expression in normal
cells and cancers is mediated by several genetic factors, including
mutation or promoter methylation of CDH1, or direct promoter
repression mediated by Snail, Slug, Twist, Zeb-1, and Sip1 (10–13),
all of which interact with E-box elements located within the
proximal region of the E-cadherin promoter (10). Several clinical
studies have shown that increased expression of E-cadherin is
associated with improved survival in several tumor types (14, 15),
and there is some evidence that small interfering RNA (siRNA)–
mediated silencing of these transcriptional suppressors can
increase cellular sensitivity to genotoxic stress (16).
Here, we characterized the effects of three conventional cancer
chemotherapeutic agents on cell death in a panel of human
pancreatic cancer cell lines to determine whether cells that were
resistant to gemcitabine were also resistant to agents that act via
independent mechanisms. We then used global gene expression
profiling and unsupervised hierarchical clustering to show that the
drug-resistant cells contained several features consistent with EMT.
Reversal of EMT via silencing of Zeb-1 not only restored the
expression of typical epithelial marker genes but also increased
cellular sensitivity to therapeutic reagents. Our data suggest that
Zeb-1 and other regulators of EMT maintain drug resistance in
human pancreatic cancer cells, and therapeutic strategies to inhibit
Zeb-1 and reverse EMT should be evaluated.

Zeb-1 Correlates Drug Resistance

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents. Ten pancreatic cancer cell lines were used for
the generation of transcriptome data. Seven pancreatic cancer cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection, including AsPC-1,
MIAPaCa-2, PANC-1, BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, Hs766T, and SU86.86. MPanc96
and human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells were obtained
from Dr. Timothy J. Eberlein (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and
Dr. M. Tsao (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada),
respectively. L3.6pl cells were derived from COLO357 that had undergone
metastasis from the pancreas to the liver of nude mice (17). For the
validation experiments, five cell lines (Suit2, SW1990, Capan-1, T3M4, and
COLO357), which were generously provided by Drs. Eric Collisson, Joe Gray,
and Martin McMahon (University of California and Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory, San Francisco, CA), were used. All of the cell lines were
genotyped by DNA fingerprinting (PowerPlex 16, Promega, Inc.). Gemcitabine was purchased from Eli Lilly and Co. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin
were purchased from Sigma.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay. Cells (3,000 per well) were
plated in 96-well plate. After 24 h, cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of the chemotherapy agents. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H -tetrazolium, inner salt
(MTS) solution (20 AL; Promega) was added to each well and the cells
were incubated at 37jC with 5% CO2 for 1 h. Absorbance at 490 nm was
then measured with a microplate reader (MRX, Danatech Laboratory).
Propidium iodide-fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.
Standard propidium iodide (PI) staining by the hypotonic lysis method
was used for apoptosis studies. Apoptosis was induced in 106 cells by
gemcitabine treatment. After 48/72 h, the cells were trypsinized, washed
once with cold PBS, then incubated for 30 min in 500 AL of hypotonic
solution (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 Ag/mL RNase, and
50 Ag/mL PI), and analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter, Inc.).
RNA isolation, microarray platform, and microarray experiments.
All transcriptome data were generated from duplicates of the cell lines. Cells
were plated and total RNA was isolated independently using Trizol reagent
(Molecular Lab) followed by cleanup with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA
was used for the synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA, which was prepared
using the Illumina RNA amplification kit (Ambion, Inc.), and then cRNA can
be hybridized to Illumina Human-6v2 (Illumina, Inc.) chip. After being
washed, the slides were scanned with BeadStation 500 (Illumina) and the
signal intensities were quantified with BeadStudio (Illumina). Quantile
normalization was used to normalize the data. Microarray data are available
on Gene Expression Omnibus with accession number GSE15550.
Data processing. BRB ArrayTools version 3.6 developed by the National
Cancer Institute (18) was used to analyze the data. To select genes that are
differentially expressed between the two different subgroups (sensitive and
resistant), a class comparison tool within BRB ArrayTools was used. The
values were averaged over replicates of samples. This software uses a twosample t test to calculate the significance of the observations (i.e., P <
0.001). To see global gene expression patterns, each gene values, adjusted to
be a mean of zero, were used for unsupervised hierarchical clustering with
Cluster and TreeView (19). The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to
analyze the correlation between gene expression and chemosensitivity.
Growth-inhibitory IC50 (GI50) values were calculated using GraphPad
software.
Pathway analysis. Functional and pathway analysis was performed
using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. This software contains a
database for identifying networks and pathways of interest in genomic data.
Real-time PCR analysis. Real-time PCR technology (StepOne, Applied
Biosystems) was used in conjunction with Assays-on-Demand (Applied
Biosystems). The comparative C T method was used to determine relative gene
expression levels for each target gene and cyclophilin A served as an internal
control to normalize for the amount of amplifiable RNA in each reaction.
Silencing of Zeb-1 expression by siRNA. Dharmacon SMARTpool
control and Zeb-1 siRNA were used with Oligofectamine according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen Corp.). Cells were incubated with the

www.aacrjournals.org

siRNA complex for 48 h, then treated with chemotherapeutic reagents, and
harvested for mRNA and protein expression changes [assayed via real-time
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot] at 48 h. Cell death
was measured by PI-fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.
Western blotting. Total cellular protein extract was isolated from
harvested cells, protein concentration was determined, and Western
blotting was carried out as described previously (20). The antibodies used
were anti-Zeb-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti–E-cadherin (Zymed
Laboratories, Inc.), and anti-actin (Sigma Chemical Co.). Same antibodies
were used for immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemistry. Cells grown in chambered slides were washed
with cold PBS and fixed with iced acetone for 5 min at room temperature.
Cells were washed with PBS and blocked with blocking solution (horse
serum/goat serum, 1:4) for 30 min. After cells were incubated with anti–Ecadherin/Zeb-1/vimentin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4jC, cells
were washed with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary
antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. Cells were washed with
PBS and mounted with Prolong Gold antifade reagent with 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (Invitrogen).
For the human samples, unstained pancreatic tissue microarray (TMA)
slides were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol. Antigen
retrieval was carried out by repetitive boiling and cooling cycles for a total
of 15 min in antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories). Endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked with 6% hydrogen peroxide in methanol,
and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with normal donkey serum.
Primary antibody diluted (1:50) in 2% bovine serum albumin/0.2% Triton in
PBS was added, and samples were incubated overnight at 4jC, after which
biotinylated secondary antibody was added and incubated for 30 min
followed by Vectastain Elite avidin-biotin complex method reagent (Vector
Laboratories) and incubation for an additional 30 min. Finally, slides were
developed with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine, counterstained with hematoxylin,
dehydrated with ethanol, and fixed with xylene and mounted. The staining
results were evaluated by a pathologist to determine the intensity and the
percentage of positive tumor cells. The staining for Zeb-1 was categorized
as positive (nuclear staining in z10% of tumor cells) or negative (no nuclear
staining or nuclear staining in <10% of tumor cells). The staining for Ecadherin was categorized as 0 (negative or less than 10% moderate to strong
membranous staining in tumor cells), 1 (z10%, but less than 50% moderate
to strong membranous staining), or 2 (z50% moderate to strong
membranous staining). The correlation between Zeb-1 and E-cadherin
was analyzed by Fisher’s exact tests using Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences software for Windows (version 12.0; SPSS, Inc.). We used a twosided significance level of 0.05.

Results
Characterization of pancreatic cancer cells based on
multidrug sensitivity. We examined the native sensitivity of one
immortalized ‘‘normal’’ human pancreatic epithelial line (HPDE)
and nine commonly available pancreatic cell lines to gemcitabine
in vitro by PI-FACS analysis. All of the lines were genotyped by DNA
fingerprinting using a commercial kit. Five of the lines (HPDE,
L3.6pl, BxPC-3, CFPAC, and SU86.86) were sensitive and five
(PANC-1, Hs766T, AsPC-1, MIAPaCa-2, and MPanc96) were
resistant based on the level of apoptosis (sub-G0-G1 population)
stimulated with 10 Amol/L gemcitabine (Fig. 1A). To test the
multidrug sensitivity of those cell lines, we performed cell viability
assays using two additional chemotherapeutic agents: cisplatin
and 5-FU. Interestingly, all of the gemcitabine-sensitive cancer
cell lines were substantially more sensitive to 5-FU and cisplatin
compared with the gemcitabine-resistant lines (Fig. 1B and C).
Log10(GI50) values of a panel of cell lines and cluster analysis
using log10(GI50) values were plotted (Fig. 1D). In the sensitive cells,
log10(GI50) values were below the mean log10(GI50) across the panel,
whereas resistant cell lines had log10(GI50) values above the mean.

Zeb-1 Correlates Drug Resistance

Identification of global gene expression patterns of pancreatic cancer cells. Our results suggested that drug sensitivity and
resistance might be controlled by broad-based mechanism(s). In an
attempt to elucidate these mechanisms, we performed global gene

expression profiling on the nine pancreatic cancer cell lines and the
normal HPDE cells using duplicate mRNA isolates obtained at
different times. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using wholegenome expression patterns in the array showed two distinct
subgroups that clearly separated the drug-sensitive from the drugresistant cell lines (Fig. 2A). Clustering of the 6,127 genes that were
differentially expressed in at least two arrays with at least a 2-fold
change showed the same expression pattern as the whole genome
(Supplementary Fig. S1). This unsupervised clustering analysis
revealed two subgroups that correlated with the multidrug
sensitivity data identified in the proliferation and apoptosis assays
in Fig. 1 (Fig. 2A).
Differential expression of cellular adhesion and motility
molecules. To identify genes that may play a role in drug
sensitivity/resistance, the differentially expressed genes between
sensitive and resistant cell lines were extracted using the class
comparison tool in BRB ArrayTools (P < 0.001). We identified
several interesting networks/pathways that were statistically
significantly enriched, including those involved in cellular movement, cellular development, molecular transport, and cancer using
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Supplementary Table S1). The 115
genes that were used for the pathway analyses are listed in
Supplementary Table S2 (P < 0.001). However, one of the most
obvious patterns that emerged from these analyses involved genes
that had been previously implicated in EMT, including genes
required for cell polarity (MAL2 and RABGEF1), adherens junction
formation (EVA1 and PTPRM), and cell motility (S100A4, GNA11,
EFEMP1, WDR44, and PKD1; Fig. 2B). All genes in Fig. 2B had
statistical significance at the cutoff of P < 0.001, except EVA1 (P =
0.0025). The differential expression of MAL2, S100A4, and EVA1 was
confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 2C), and P values and fold
changes of the genes are summarized in Table 1. In addition to
t test, to determine the relationship between drug sensitivity and
gene expression, Pearson correlation analysis was performed using
GI50 values (in Fig. 1D) and expression of genes in Fig. 2B
(Supplementary Table S3). Not all the expression of the genes was
directly correlated with GI50, although the significant patterns were
observed in class comparison analysis (t test). We speculate that
the EMT phenotype is roughly bimodal in the cells, which may
explain why gene expression and GI50 are not be linearly correlated.
Cellular morphology and the expression of EMT markers.
We subsequently performed experiments to assess the role of EMT
in drug resistance in more detail. Simple light microscopic analysis
of the cell lines confirmed that the drug-sensitive cells were
uniform in shape and grew in tightly adherent ‘‘sheets’’ of cells in
monolayer culture, whereas the drug-resistant cells were more
irregular in shape and did not form close attachments in culture
(data not shown), indicating that the drug-resistant cells displayed
a more ‘‘mesenchymal’’ phenotype. To further confirm our
observation, we assessed the levels of E-cadherin (epithelial marker;
P = 0.0084), Zeb-1 (a transcriptional suppressor of E-cadherin; P =
0.0085), and vimentin (mesenchymal markers; P = 0.12) in the gene
expression data. We observed a statistically significant inverse
correlation (r = 0.797; P = 0.006) between E-cadherin and Zeb-1
(Fig. 3A) that was associated with the EMT phenotype. We
confirmed these expression data by real-time RT-PCR using the
same RNA from the array experiment (Fig. 3A). We then analyzed
the protein levels of epithelial marker E-cadherin and its
transcriptional suppressor Zeb-1 and also the mesenchymal
marker vimentin in three sensitive and three resistant cells by
immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3B–D). The staining patterns

clearly confirmed the gene expression and real-time RT-PCR data
in that all of the epithelial cell lines expressed E-cadherin with no
expression of Zeb-1 and vimentin, whereas all the resistant cell
lines highly expressed Zeb-1 with no expression of E-cadherin and
vimentin, with the exception of Hs766T, which does not express
vimentin. To test the hypothesis that mesenchymal cells would
show more migratory properties, we performed migration assays.
As we expected, in general, the epithelial cells were less migratory
than the mesenchymal cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Effects of silencing Zeb-1 on EMT-related gene expression
and drug sensitivity. The gene expression and real-time PCR data
suggested to us that Zeb-1 might negatively regulate E-cadherin
expression and possibly drug sensitivity. To test this hypothesis, we
knocked down Zeb-1 using siRNA in PANC-1 and assessed the
effects on EMT-related gene expression. Zeb-1–specific siRNA
significantly reduced expression of Zeb-1 and that this was
associated with a significant induction of E-cadherin mRNA and
protein expression (Fig. 4A and B). Furthermore, Zeb-1 silencing
up-regulated expression of EVA1 and MAL2, two other epithelial
markers that were expressed at low levels in the mesenchymal cells,
showing that all three epithelial genes are directly or indirectly
regulated by this transcriptional repressor (Fig. 4B). Then, we
measured the effects of Zeb-1 silencing on drug-induced cell death
in several of the drug-resistant cell lines (PANC-1, MIAPaCa-2, and
Hs766T). Significant increases of apoptotic cell death were
measured in Zeb-1 silencing cells after gemcitabine, 5-FU, and
cisplatin treatment in PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2, whereas moderate
effects were observed in Hs766T, showing that Zeb-1 does play a
direct role in drug resistance in pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 4C).
Validation of the inverse correlation of E-cadherin and Zeb1 expression in primary patient tissues and five independent
pancreatic cancer cell lines. Qualitative analyses of E-cadherin
and Zeb-1 expression in a pancreatic patient TMA revealed
an inverse correlation between Zeb-1 and E-cadherin expression
(P = 0.012). E-cadherin was identified primarily in the cell junctions
as an adherent molecule and Zeb-1 was found primarily in the
nucleus as a transcriptional factor (Fig. 5A).
To further evaluate the relationship between the inverse
correlation between E-cadherin and Zeb-1 and drug sensitivity,
we performed an independent validation experiment using five
new pancreatic cancer cell lines. Two cell lines (Suit2 and SW1990)
expressed high-level expression of Zeb-1 and low-level expression
of E-cadherin, whereas the other three cell lines (Capan-1, T3M4,
and COLO357) showed high expression of E-cadherin with low
expression of Zeb-1 (Fig. 5B). As anticipated, the epithelial cells
(Capan-1, T3M4, and COLO357) were relatively sensitive to
gemcitabine, cisplatin, and 5-FU, and opposite trend was observed
in mesenchymal cells (Suit2 and SW1990; Fig. 5C). Expression
profiling of four of five cell lines (T3M4, COLO357, Capan-1, and

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

Suit2) further confirmed our hypothesis, showing that both groups
clustered along with sensitive or resistant subtypes in Fig. 2A
(Supplementary Fig. S3). COLO357, the parental cell line for L3.6pl,
expressed high levels of E-cadherin and low levels of Zeb-1 and was
highly sensitive to drug, showing that the phenotype is stable even
after multiple in vitro and in vivo passaging of the cells.

Discussion
In this study, we identified a molecular mechanism of multidrug
resistance in pancreatic cancer cells. We evaluated the sensitivity of
a panel of pancreatic cancer cells to three chemotherapeutic agents
and identified a correlation between the patterns of drug
sensitivity/resistance and global gene expression. Importantly,
Zeb-1–mediated EMT seems to be a major mediator of this drug
resistance in pancreatic cancer cell lines.
Our global gene expression patterns show that there are shared
drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms in pancreatic cancer
(Fig. 2A). Morphologic changes identified by light microscopy led
us to examine the expressional correlation of E-cadherin and its
transcriptional regulators in our transcriptome analysis. The loss of
E-cadherin expression mediated by transcriptional suppression has
been associated with a poor clinical outcome in several types of
cancers (14, 21). The importance of particular transcriptional
repressors in maintaining the EMT phenotype may vary depending
on the tissue type (14, 15, 21–24). However, our pharmacogenomics
approach suggests that Zeb-1 plays a dominant role in the
pancreatic cancer cell lines we studied here and that Snail,
Slug, Twist, and Sip1 do not correlate significantly with drug
resistance (Supplementary Fig. S4). We confirmed that the inverse
correlation between E-cadherin and Zeb-1 was also present in
primary patient tumor samples (Fig. 5A). Whether EMT correlates
with gemcitabine resistance in patients will require further
investigation.
A recent study using siRNA to silence Zeb-1 showed that Zeb-1
can suppress the transcription of multiple genes involved in
determining epithelial polarity, including the cadherin families and
components of tight and gap junctions, showing the ubiquitous
role of the EMT phenotype genes (25). Similarly, we have shown
that increased E-cadherin expression after silencing of Zeb-1 was
accompanied by increased drug sensitivity (Fig. 4C). Importantly,
EMT also correlates with resistance to the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib (26), a biological agent that is
currently being combined with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer
patients (27), and our data show that Zeb-1 silencing also enhances
sensitivity to erlotinib in PANC-1 cells.6 Zeb-1 represses E-cadherin

expression by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDAC) to E-box
elements within the E-cadherin promoter. Thus, recent studies
have shown that clinically relevant HDAC inhibitors, such as
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), can restore E-cadherin
expression and sensitivity to gemcitabine and other agents (28, 29).
We have also found that SAHA causes up-regulation of E-cadherin
and down-regulation of Zeb-1 and restores gemcitabine and
gefitinib sensitivity in several of the mesenchymal lines characterized in this study.7 Thus, it may be possible to use HDAC inhibitors

to reverse the EMT phenotype and restore drug sensitivity to
pancreatic cancers and other solid tumors.
All of the drugs used in this study are DNA damaging agents.
Among commonly used conventional cancer chemotherapeutic
agents, taxanes are unique because they do not seem to act by
inducing DNA damage but rather target microtubules leading to
mitotic arrest and apoptosis. For reasons that are not entirely clear,
taxanes have not been used for pancreatic cancer treatment. We
tested the effects of paclitaxel in our panel of cell lines to determine
whether EMT correlated with Taxol resistance. Interestingly,
paclitaxel resistance did not correlate well with EMT (data not
shown). For example, the GI50s of paclitaxel in the Hs766T and

MIAPaCa-2 cells were lower than the mean GI50 across the panel
(Supplementary Fig. S5). It has been reported that paclitaxel
sensitivity does not correlate with sensitivity to cisplatin and
oxaliplatin in primary human pancreatic cancer cells (30). In future
studies, we plan to explore the molecular basis for the observed
heterogeneity in taxane responsiveness in our cells. It is possible
that taxanes might have activity in pancreatic cancers that are
resistant to the agents that are currently being used in the
treatment of the disease.
Gemcitabine efficacy is limited due to the rapid development of
resistance in patients with pancreatic cancer. There are multiple
known factors responsible for this resistance, including upregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT, S100A4, HMGA,
and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes (3, 31, 32).
With respect to the latter, 48 distinct transporters within seven
different subfamilies have been identified. They function as

transmembrane proteins that transport lipid, cholesterol, and drug
metabolites out of the cell. It has been shown that several of these
ABC transporters are associated with gemcitabine resistance (32,
33). Interestingly, we did not detect any relationship between the
expression of ABC transporters and drug sensitivity within our
panel of cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). S100A4, one of the calcium
binding protein family of S100s, has been linked to migratory and
invasive properties in several other solid tumors, including prostate
cancer, breast cancer, and gastric cancer (34–36). We also
confirmed that the resistant cells with high expression of S100A4
have greater migratory properties than the sensitive cells that have
a low expression of S100A4 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Knockdown of
S100A4 also has been reported to cause an increase in E-cadherin

expression and an increased latency of tumor formation (34).
Conversely, increased expression of S100A4 and decreased
expression of E-cadherin have been shown to correlate with a
poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients (36). Evaluation of
patients samples has shown hypomethylation of S100A4, causing
down-regulation of E-cadherin in the majority of pancreatic
cancers. This shows its role as a potential prognostic marker and
possible therapeutic target (37, 38). Our study confirms the inverse
relationship between S100A4 and E-cadherin as well. However, the
mechanism of regulation of S100A4 and E-cadherin is not clear, and
further investigation of this mechanism will be required.
The loss of cellular polarity and homotypic adhesion are major
components of EMT. Our transcriptome analyses revealed various
EMT-related genes, such as PKD, MAL2, and EVA1, which seem to
be associated with drug sensitivity in pancreatic cancer cells.
Transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) is a known activator of the
EMT program via the major signaling pathways Smad, raf, notch,
and PKD (39–41). The blockage of PKD expression by siRNA or a
specific inhibitor attenuated TGF-h–induced EMT (41). Likewise,
EVA1 and MAL2 are expressed on many types of epithelial cells
(42–44). The functions of EVA1 and MAL2 in human cancer are not
well characterized, but their mRNA expression levels correlated
with sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors and the epithelial phenotype
(26, 45). Interestingly, knockdown of Zeb-1 expression restored the
expression of MAL2 (46). Our data also identify an inverse
correlation between EVA1/MAL2 and Zeb-1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 4B), again suggesting an important role of
Zeb-1 in regulating the EMT program.

In this study, the measurement of basal gene expression levels
enabled us to identify Zeb-1–mediated EMT as a multidrug
resistance mechanism in pancreatic cancer. Zeb-1 silencing can
partially restore the drug sensitivity in resistant cells, implying that
other signaling pathways might be responsible for drug resistance
mechanism. Because of the limited number of cell lines used in our
experiments, there may be many other important biological factors
that contribute to drug resistance in pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, pancreatic cancer is exemplified by the presence of an
extensive tumor-associated stroma, and recent studies have
confirmed that stromal cells also contribute to drug resistance
(47). We are currently expanding our panel of cell lines and models
to include conventional and primary xenografts that directly
address these issues. Overall, we remain confident that by
using gene expression profiling as a starting point to identify
the biological properties associated with drug sensitivity or
resistance, we will ultimately be able to better match tumors to
effective therapies and improve disease control in patients.
