A Mechanism of Hypoxia-Mediated Escape from Adaptive
Immunity in Cancer Cells
Ivraym B. Barsoum1, Chelsea A. Smallwood1, D. Robert Siemens1,2, and Charles H. Graham1,2

Abstract
Immune escape is a fundamental trait of cancer in which mechanistic knowledge is incomplete. Here, we
describe a novel mechanism by which hypoxia contributes to tumoral immune escape from cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL). Exposure of human or murine cancer cells to hypoxia for 24 hours led to upregulation of
the immune inhibitory molecule programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1; also known as B7-H1), in a manner
dependent on the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a). In vivo studies also demonstrated cellular colocalization of HIF-1a and PD-L1 in tumors. Hypoxia-induced expression of PD-L1 in
cancer cells increased their resistance to CTL-mediated lysis. Using glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), an agonist of
nitric oxide (NO) signaling known to block HIF-1a accumulation in hypoxic cells, we prevented hypoxiainduced PD-L1 expression and diminished resistance to CTL-mediated lysis. Moreover, transdermal administration of GTN attenuated tumor growth in mice. We found that higher expression of PD-L1 induced in
tumor cells by exposure to hypoxia led to increased apoptosis of cocultured CTLs and Jurkat leukemia T cells.
This increase in apoptosis was prevented by blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1, the PD-L1 receptor
on T cells, or by addition of GTN. Our ﬁndings point to a role for hypoxia/HIF-1 in driving immune escape
from CTL, and they suggest a novel cancer immunotherapy to block PD-L1 expression in hypoxic-tumor cells
by administering NO mimetics. Cancer Res; 74(3); 665–74. 2013 AACR.

(IFN-g) was shown to stimulate the expression of PD-L1 in
cancer cell lines (5). In addition, signaling via phosphatase
and tensin homolog/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PTEN/
PI3K) was linked to the posttranscriptional regulation of PDL1 expression (6). Interleukin (IL)-10, VEGF, activation of
Toll-like receptor-4, and signaling via extracellular signalregulated kinase, were also reported to increase PD-L1
expression (7–9).
Many studies have demonstrated the important contribution of hypoxia to the acquisition of malignant properties in
cancer cells such as drug resistance (10) and metastatic ability
(11–13); however, the effect of hypoxia on tumor immune
escape remains poorly understood. We previously showed
that exposure of tumor cells to hypoxia increases their
intrinsic resistance to lysis mediated by innate immune
effector cells (14, 15). In the present study, we investigated
whether exposure of tumor cells to hypoxia increases their
resistance to adaptive (T cell-mediated) immunity. We report
here that hypoxia increases the expression of PD-L1 in human
breast and prostate cancer cells, as well as in mouse melanoma and mammary carcinoma cells, and that increased
expression of these inhibitory molecules leads to resistance
to CTL-mediated lysis.

Materials and Methods

An important feature of malignant progression is the
selection of tumor cell variants that are capable of escaping
detection and destruction by the innate and adaptive arms
of the immune system (1). There is evidence that tumor cells
can escape from adaptive immunity by increasing their
surface expression of inhibitory B7 costimulatory molecules
(2, 3). These cell surface molecules are members of a family
of activating and inhibitory costimulatory ligands with
important roles in the regulation of CTL responses (3). A
member of this family of molecules, programmed cell death
ligand-1 (PD-L1, also known as B7-H1), is expressed in
human and rodent tumors to provide negative signals that
suppress CTL responses.
PD-L1 interacts with the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)
receptor on activated CTLs to inhibit immune responses via
mechanisms that include induction of apoptosis and anergy
in the CTLs (4). Although the mechanisms regulating PD-L1
expression have not been fully elucidated, interferon-g

MDA-MB-231 and DU145 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FBS, whereas
Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS. Mouse B16-F10 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% FBS. Mouse B16-OVA melanoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. Scott A. Gerber (University of Rochester Medical
Center, Rochester, NY), and were maintained in RPMI 1640/
10% FBS medium supplemented with G418 (100 mg/mL). The
authenticity of these cell lines has not been veriﬁed in the last
six months. All experiments were conducted using cultures not
exceeding 60% to 70% conﬂuence to avoid pericellular hypoxia
induced by overconﬂuence.
Blocking antibodies
To block human PD-L1 or PD-1 function, we used antihuman PD-L1 antibody (4 mg/mL; BioLegend; Cat. #329702) or
anti-human PD-1 (2 mg/mL; R&D Systems; Cat. #AF1086). To
block mouse PD-L1 or PD-1 (CD279), we used anti-mouse PDL1 antibody (2 mg/mL; eBiosciences; Cat. #16-5982-81) or antimouse PD-1 antibody (anti-CD279; 1 mg/mL; BD Pharmingen;
Cat. #551891), respectively.
mRNA knockdown
Knockdown of human hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a)
or PD-L1 (CD274) expression was achieved using Silencervalidated siRNA #42840 or Silencer Select siRNA #s26547
(Ambion Inc.), respectively. To knock down mouse PD-L1
(CD274) or mouse HIF-1a, we used Silencer Select siRNA
#s82016 or #s67530 (Ambion Inc.), respectively. Silencer Negative Control siRNA #2 (Ambion Inc.) was used as control. The
siRNA (25 nmol/L ﬁnal concentration) was introduced into
cells using siPORT NeoFx reagent (Ambion Inc.) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Treatments with siRNA were
performed 24 hours before incubation in hypoxia or standard
conditions.
Exposure to different levels of oxygen
Tumor cell cultures were incubated under control (20% O2)
or hypoxic (0.5% O2) conditions for 24 hours as described
previously (15). Culture conditions included incubations in the
absence or presence of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN; 10 nmol/L) or
blocking antibodies. In some experiments, DU145 cells were
incubated in 20% O2 for 24 hours in the presence of the
hypoxia mimic cobalt chloride (100 mmol/L). Pilot studies
revealed that CD3þ lymphocytes showed signs of apoptosis
when incubated in 20% O2. Therefore, control groups of
coculture experiments involving CD3þ lymphocytes were
conducted in 8% O2 to simulate more physiologic oxygen
concentrations.
Determination of PD-L1 and HIF-1a expression
Relative levels of PD-L1 mRNA in tumor cells were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR)
using a Roche LightCycler 480 instrument. A cDNA obtained
using a Qiagen Omniscript Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen
Inc.) was used as template in qRT-PCRs. PCRs included primers for human PD-L1 spanning exons 3 and 4 (forward: 50 -

(Fast Start SYBR Green Master, Roche Diagnostics Canada).
Human b-actin primers (forward: 50 TGGGACGACATGGAGAAAAT 30 , reverse: 50 GAGGCGTACAGGGATAGCAC 30 ,
Euroﬁns MWG Operon) were used to generate standard
curves. The following program was used for PCRs for human
genes: 95 C for 3 minutes, then 50 cycles: 95 C for 20 seconds,
melting temperature (Tm) 60 C for 20 seconds, 72 C for 20
seconds. Primers used to amplify mouse PD-L1 were: forward
50 -GACCAGCTTTTGAAGGGAAATG-30 , and reverse 50 -CTGGTTGATTTTGCGGTATGG-30 (Euroﬁns). Primers used to
amplify mouse 18S were: forward 50 -GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-30 , and reverse 50 -CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-30
(Euroﬁns). The following program was used for PCRs for
mouse genes: 95 C for 3 minutes, then 50 cycles: 95 C for 20
seconds, Tm 55 C for 20 seconds, 72 C for 20 seconds.
Cellular HIF-1a and PD-L1 protein levels were determined
in total cell extracts by Western blot analysis. Antibodies used
included monoclonal mouse anti-human PD-L1 antibody
(1/250 dilution; R&D Systems; MAB156), rat anti-mouse PDL1 antibody (1/250 dilution; eBiosciences; 14-5982-82), and
monoclonal mouse anti-human HIF-1a antibody (1/250 dilution; BD Biosciences; # 610958). Membranes were probed for
b-actin or a-tubulin to control for differences in the loading of
the gels. Corresponding bands were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence. Alternatively, surface PD-L1 levels were
measured in B16-OVA cells by ﬂow cytometry using rat antimouse PD-L1 antibody (eBiosciences; #14-5982-82) and a
standard protocol.
Overexpression of HIF-1a in MDA-MB-231 cells
Plasmid DNA (either pCMV6-kan/neo empty vector or
pCMV6-kan/neo vector expressing nonmutant HIF-1a; generously provided by Dr. Lynne Postovit, Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada) was introduced
into MDA-MB-231 cells at a concentration of 2.5 mg/well using
Lipofectamine 2000 (5 mL/well; Invitrogen). Following a 24hour incubation in 20% O2, the medium was replaced and cells
were allowed to recover for another 24 hours. Cells were then
harvested, lysed, and the protein was extracted and used for
Western blot analysis.
Identiﬁcation of HIF-1a–binding sites in PD-L1
Canonical hypoxia response elements (HRE; TACGTG) within genomic sequences of PD-L1 were ﬁrst identiﬁed using
the Ensembl genome browser (URL: http://useast.ensembl.
org/index.html). Two potential HIF-1a–binding sites were
mapped. The ﬁrst HRE (HRE1) is located between exons 1
and 2, 4,559 bp downstream from the start of exon 1
[ENSE00001892659]. The second HRE (HRE2) is located
between exons 4 and 5, 1,545 bp downstream from the start
of exon 4 [ENSE00000813157]. To determine whether indeed
these are bona ﬁde HIF-1a–binding sequences, we performed
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an ExactaChIP
Human/Mouse HIF-1a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
Kit (R&D Systems) according to the instructions provided
with the kit. Precipitated DNA was ampliﬁed using primers

ﬂanking the putative HREs. Primers for HRE1 were: forward
50 - GGAACATTAATCTCCTGTCTTATATAGC-30 (Tm: 61.5)
and reverse 50 -TCTCCCTCTTCTGTTATACATATATTTACA30 (Tm: 62.2). Primers for HRE2 were: forward 50 -TGGCCTACAGTAACTCACCT-30 (Tm: 62.3) and reverse 50 -CCGTAACTTACAGTTTACAATGCC-30 (Tm: 62.0). Primers were designed
using online tools from Integrated DNA Technologies (http://
www.idtdna.com/).
Isolation of human CD3þ T lymphocytes and coculture
experiments
Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from
Ficoll-Paque–fractionated blood of healthy human donors.
Blood was obtained after approval from the Faculty of Health
Sciences Research Ethics Board (Queen's University) and the
signing of an informed consent form. Lymphocytes were sorted
using magnetic microbeads coated with anti-CD3 antibody
(Miltenyi Biotec; Cat. # 130-050-101) and an autoMACS Pro
Separator (Miltenyi Biotec).
To test the effect of tumor cells on lymphocyte apoptosis,
human tumor cells were cocultured with either peripheral
blood CTLs or Jurkat leukemia T cells. Cocultures at two
different lymphocyte:tumor cell ratios (5:1 and 10:1, for CTL
and Jurkat cell cocultures, respectively) were incubated under
hypoxic (0.5% O2) or control (20% or 8% O2) conditions for 24
hours. CD3þ T lymphocytes were activated with human recombinant IL- 2(Sigma #17908 1,000 U/107 cells) for 24 hours.
Alternatively, tumor cells were incubated in hypoxia (0.5%
O2) for 24 hours before coculture in 20% O2 with IL-2–activated
CD3þ CTLs for a further 24 hours. T lymphocytes were also
incubated in the absence of other cells under hypoxic or
control conditions to determine the potential effects of hypoxia alone on apoptosis as determined below. Expression of
surface PD-1 in CD3þ peripheral blood lymphocytes and Jurkat
leukemia T cells was determined by ﬂow cytometry using
phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human PD-1 (CD279) antibody
(eBiosciences; Cat. #12-9969).
Generation of tumor-speciﬁc CTLs and cytotoxicity assay
To determine whether hypoxia induces resistance of tumor
cells to adaptive immunity, we performed cytotoxicity assays
using primed mouse CD3þ CTLs as effectors and B16-OVA or
B16-F10 melanoma cells as targets, both of which express PDL1 (16). To generate tumor-speciﬁc CTLs from precursor T cells
in vivo, we followed a well-established protocol (17). Brieﬂy,
female C57Bl/6 mice (6–8 weeks old; The Jackson Laboratory)
were injected intraperitoneally with 5  106 mitomycin Ctreated B16-OVA melanoma cells. Fourteen days later, mice
were euthanized and their spleens were removed and passed
through a ﬁne wire mesh in order to obtain single-cell suspensions. Following lysis of red blood cells, CD3þ lymphocytes
were isolated from the primed splenic lymphocytes using
magnetic microbeads coated with anti-mouse CD3 antibody
(Miltenyi Biotec; Cat. #130-095-130). CD3þ lymphocytes were
expanded by coculture for ﬁve days with mitomycin C-treated
B16-OVA cells, at a ratio of 5:1, using sensitization medium
(RPMI-10 medium containing 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate and
1 nonessential amino acids) in the presence of recombinant

IL-2 (Sigma-Aldrich; Cat. # SRP3085; 30 U/mL). Cytotoxicity
was assessed by means of a LIVE/DEAD cell viability/cytotoxicity assay (Invitrogen) as we reported previously (15).
Flow cytometric assessment of apoptosis
Extent of apoptosis in CD3þCD8þ lymphocytes from
coculture studies was determined by two-color ﬂow cytometry using FITC-Annexin V (5 mL/test; BD Biosciences;
#556420) as well as anti-human CD8þ phycoerythrin (PE)tagged antibody (BD Biosciences; #555635). For determination of Jurkat cell apoptosis, an apoptosis detection kit
APO-BRDU (BD Biosciences; # 556405) was used. All ﬂow
cytometric analyses were performed using a Beckman Coulter EPICS Altra HSS ﬂow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter).
Apoptotic index was determined from the percentage of
apoptotic Jurkat cells, or percentage of apoptotic CD3þCD8þ
relative to total CD3þ CTLs. The percentage was then
normalized relative to control values (of 20% O2 exposure)
for each experiment.
Tumor growth study
Female Balb/c mice (6–8 weeks old; The Jackson Laboratory) were inoculated orthotopically in the left mammary fat
pad with 3.5  103 syngeneic 4T1 cells in 100 mL of PBS. When
the tumors reached a palpable size (50–100 mm3), mice were
randomly divided in two groups: (i) 24 mice treated with 0.25
cm2 Minitran transdermal patches (3M Pharmaceuticals)
delivering 1.8 mg of GTN per hour and placed on the back of
the neck and (ii) 17 mice treated with transdermal placebo
patches. Tumor volumes were measured every two days using
digital calipers. The formula used to calculate tumor volume
was length  width2 divided by 2.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was
used for all statistical analyses. For ﬂow cytometry, expression
was presented as percentage of positive cells, and analyzed by
one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison test. The relative means of immunoblot densitometric
values were calculated (compared with a-tubulin or b-actin)
and analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni' multiple comparison test. Differences were considered to
be statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05. Cytotoxicity results were
analyzed by one-way ANOVA of the Y-intercepts of the linear
regressions of killing curves pooled from different experiments,
followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison test to determine whether differences between individual treatment
groups reached statistical signiﬁcance. Two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison test was used to
determine statistical differences between cytolytic activities at
individual effector-to-target ratios as well as to determine
differences in 4T1 tumor growth.

Hypoxia Induces Immune Escape in Cancer

in increased PD-L1 protein levels when compared with
incubation in control conditions (20% O2; Fig. 1A). HIF-1 is
a heterodimeric transcription factor, consisting of HIF-1a
and HIF-1b subunits, known to mediate the activation of
genes involved in cellular adaptations to hypoxia. Thus,
accumulation of HIF-1a under hypoxic conditions is critical
for the expression of hypoxia-inducible genes. To determine
if HIF-1a is required for the hypoxia-induced expression of
PD-L1, we ﬁrst assessed whether the levels of HIF-1a and
PD-L1 are correlated in cells incubated in 20% O2, 0.5% O2, or
in 20% O2 in combination with the hypoxia mimic cobalt
chloride. Results of Western immunoblots revealed that
there was a signiﬁcant correlation (Pearson r ¼ 0.691; P <
0.0001) between HIF-1a and PD-L1 levels in MDA-MB-231
cells incubated under these conditions for 24 hours (Fig. 1B).
This correlation persisted even in some experiments in
which HIF-1a levels were unusually high in cultures incubated in 20% O2. Also, when HIF-1a was overexpressed in
20% O2 in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with a cDNAencoding HIF-1a, PD-L1 protein expression was signiﬁcantly
upregulated (P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S1).
We then determined by immunoﬂuorescence whether HIF1a and PD-L1 colocalize in vivo in a mouse tumor model.
Mouse 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells were injected orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of syngeneic Balb/c female
mice and allowed to form tumors. Earlier results had revealed
that PD-L1 mRNA expression was upregulated by hypoxia in
these cells and that this upregulation was prevented when HIF1a was knocked down (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Results
demonstrated cellular colocalization of HIF-1a (nuclear) and
PD-L1 (mostly cytoplasmic) in 4T1 tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S2B).
To determine whether HIF-1a interacts with PD-L1 genomic sequences, we conducted ChIP assays using primer
sequences ﬂanking two potential HIF-1a HREs located
within the PD-L1 gene. Results of standard and qRT-PCR
revealed that HIF-1a binds to HRE2 (see Materials and
Methods section) in the intron located between exons 4 and
5 of the PD-L1 genomic sequences in both DU145 and MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 1C; see legend for details). The second
canonical sequence (HRE1) did not exhibit detectable binding of HIF-1a (data not shown; see Materials and Methods
section). To conﬁrm that HIF-1a is indeed required for the
hypoxia-induced expression of PD-L1, we conducted HIF-1a
knockdown experiments using validated siRNA. Knockdown
of HIF-1a expression with siRNA prevented HIF-1a protein
accumulation in DU145 cells incubated in 0.5% O2 for 24
hours (Supplementary Fig. S2C) and inhibited the hypoxiamediated increase in PD-L1 mRNA and cell surface protein
levels (determined by ﬂow cytometry) in human DU145

Hypoxia increases resistance to CTL-mediated lysis in
tumor cells via a mechanism dependent on HIF-1a,
PD-L1, and PD-1
To further investigate the relevance of hypoxia-induced
expression of PD-L1 to tumor cell escape from adaptive
immunity, we used in vivo/ex vivo-generated CTLs as effectors
against B16-OVA cells in cytolytic assays performed in vitro
(Fig. 2). B16-OVA cells express high levels of chicken ovalbumin
(OVA) on the surface. Therefore, immunization of C57Bl/6
mice with mitomycin C-treated B16-OVA cells results in the
expansion of OVA-speciﬁc CTLs. Additional in vitro priming of
CD3þ CTLs isolated from spleens of immunized mice led to
further proliferation of lymphocytes with cytolytic activity
against OVA-expressing cells. Thus, we tested the cytolytic
activity of these CD3þ CTLs using as targets B16-OVA cells
preincubated in hypoxia or standard conditions. To account for
nonspeciﬁc, OVA-independent, cytolytic activity in the
expanded splenic lymphocyte population, we also conducted
control assays using B16-F10 melanoma cells that do not
express ovalbumin. As previously reported (18–20), there was
some nonspeciﬁc cytolytic activity of CD3þ CTLs against B16F10 cells that was also independent of hypoxia (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). This nonspeciﬁc cytolytic activity at each effector:
target ratio was subtracted from the cytolytic activity at
corresponding effector:target ratios in assays using B16-OVA
cells as targets in order to determine OVA-speciﬁc cell killing
(Fig. 2). The total cytolytic activity curves, which include
speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc cell killing, are provided in Supplementary Fig. S3B–S3E.
To determine a potential role of HIF-1a, PD-L1, and PD-1
in hypoxia-induced resistance to CTL-mediated lysis, we
used the siRNA knockdown approach (for HIF-1a and PDL1) as well as blocking antibodies (for PD-L1 and PD-1).
Before performing the cytotoxicity assays, we conﬁrmed
siRNA-mediated knockdown of PD-L1 expression in B16OVA cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Cytotoxicity assays
revealed that hypoxic (0.5% O2) preincubation of B16-OVA
cells, either transfected with control siRNA or preincubated
with control immunoglobulin G (IgG), resulted in a significant decrease in CTL-mediated lysis (percent killing) when
compared with preincubation in 20% O2 (Fig. 2A–D). This
effect of hypoxia on resistance to CTL-mediated lysis did not
occur in OVA-negative B16-F10 melanoma cells, which were
signiﬁcantly (P < 0.001) more resistant to CTL-mediated
lysis than the B16-OVA cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). This
ﬁnding indicates that the hypoxia-induced resistance to
lysis in B16-OVA cells is due to reduced killing by OVAspeciﬁc CD3þ CTLs. Knockdown of HIF-1a or PD-L1 with
siRNA in B16-OVA cells abolished the hypoxia-induced

(Continued.) For these experiments, both cell lines were transfected with either scrambled control siRNA or HIF-1a siRNA before exposure to either 20%
or 0.5% O2. Graphs in D represent pooled data from three to ﬁve experiments. A representative ﬂow cytometry histogram indicating the effect of
hypoxia and HIF-1a knockdown on PD-L1 expression in B16-OVA cells is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2D. Results of ﬂow cytometry showed a 19%  2%
increase in the PD-L1 mean ﬂuorescence intensity (P < 0.01) in control siRNA-transfected B16-OVA cells incubated in 0.5% O2 versus 20% O2. This
effect of hypoxia was abrogated in cells transfected with HIF-1a siRNA (data not shown).  , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001.

resistance to CTL-mediated killing (Fig. 2A and B). Similarly,
incubation of B16-OVA cells with either PD-L1 or PD-1
blocking antibodies resulted in inhibition of hypoxiainduced resistance to CTL-mediated lysis (Fig. 2C and D).
Results of two-way ANOVA of the mean cytolytic activities
at each individual effector-to-target ratio are shown in

that the resistance to CTL-mediated lysis in B16-OVA cells
exposed to hypoxia requires the expression of functional
HIF-1a, PD-L1, and PD-1. On the basis of our results
showing that hypoxia increases PD-L1 expression in a
manner dependent on HIF-1a (Fig. 1D), we propose that
the hypoxia-induced resistance to CTL-mediated lysis in
B16-OVA cells is a result of increased interaction between
PD-L1 on the tumor cells and PD-1 on the CTLs.

GTN inhibits the hypoxia-induced upregulation of PD-L1
expression and the hypoxia-induced resistance to CTLmediated lysis
We previously reported that the hypoxia-induced accumulation of HIF-1a protein could be prevented by incubating
DU145 cells in the presence of low concentrations of the nitric
oxide (NO) mimetic GTN or 8-bromo-cGMP, an activator of
classical NO signaling (15). Incubation of DU145, MDA-MB231, or B16-OVA cells in the presence of GTN (10 nmol/L) for 24
hours blocked the hypoxia-induced upregulation of PD-L1
expression at the mRNA and protein levels as determined by
qRT-PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 3A–C). Moreover, incubation of B16-OVA cells in the presence of GTN (10 nmol/L)
resulted in inhibition of hypoxia-induced resistance to CTLmediated lysis (Fig. 3D). These results point to a potential

To further elucidate the mechanism by which hypoxia-induced
upregulation of PD-L1 expression leads to tumor-cell resistance to CTL-mediated lysis, we determined the effect of PD-L1
upregulation in tumor cells on T-cell apoptosis. Speciﬁcally, we
measured apoptosis (Annexin V or apo-BrDU labeling) in
Jurkat leukemia T cells or peripheral blood human CD3þ
lymphocytes incubated either alone or in coculture with

Hypoxia Induces Immune Escape in Cancer

plated at higher numbers than their T-cell "targets". Incubations were carried out for 24 hours in either 20% O2 (Jurkat
cells), 8% O2 (CD3þ lymphocytes), or 0.5% O2 (both cell
types; Fig. 4A and B). We cultured CD3þ lymphocytes in 8%
O2 (physiologic levels) rather than 20% O2 because incubation
of these cells alone in 20% O2 increased their basal level of
apoptosis. However, exposure of Jurkat cells or CD3þ lymphocytes alone to 0.5% O2 (versus 20% or 8% O2, respectively) did
not signiﬁcantly affect their basal level of apoptosis (Fig. 4A and
B). When cocultured with DU145 cells in 0.5% O2, the apoptotic
index of T cells (see Materials and Methods section) increased
substantially (Fig. 4A and B). Incubation of the cocultures in
the presence of GTN, PD-L1 blocking antibody, or PD-1 blocking antibody signiﬁcantly attenuated the extent of apoptosis
induced by hypoxia (Fig. 4A and B). We conﬁrmed by ﬂow
cytometry the expression of PD-1 in Jurkat cells and CD8þ
peripheral blood lymphocytes. Compared with CD3þ peripheral blood lymphocytes, a higher number of Jurkat cells
expressed surface PD-1 (91.3% vs. 8.1%; Fig. 4C), which paralleled the levels of apoptosis in these T cells induced by the
hypoxic tumor cells (Fig. 4A and B). To provide further evidence that hypoxia induced apoptosis in T cells by upregulating PD-L1 expression in the tumor cells, we preincubated
DU145 cells alone in 0.5% or 20% O2 for 24 hours before
coculture with CD3þ lymphocytes in 8% O2 for a further 24
hours. Indeed, the extent of apoptosis was signiﬁcantly higher
in CD3þCD8þ lymphocytes cocultured with DU145 cells preincubated in 0.5% O2 versus 20% O2 (Fig. 4C). Furthermore,
preincubation of DU145 cells in hypoxia in the presence of
GTN or PD-L1 blocking antibody inhibited the proapoptotic
effect of hypoxic DU145 cells on T cells (Fig. 4C). These results
reveal that hypoxia may contribute to cancer immune evasion
by inducing CTL apoptosis through a pathway involving
increased tumor cell PD-L1 expression. Our results show that
this pathway is dependent on HIF-1a and that it can be
inhibited by GTN.
These ﬁndings reveal a novel mechanism of escape from
adaptive immunity operating in tumor cells exposed to

hypoxia. Together with our previous studies showing that
hypoxia contributes to tumor cell escape from innate immunity (14, 15), the results of the present study provide evidence that hypoxia also contributes to a key phase of cancer
immunoediting, i.e., escape from adaptive immunity (1),
thereby promoting malignant progression. Thus, targeting
speciﬁc steps in these mechanisms of immune escape—for
example, through the use of NO mimetics such as GTN or
small molecule inhibitors—could lead to novel immunotherapeutic strategies.
