Abstract
Highly metastatic and chemotherapy-resistant properties of malignant melanomas stand as challenging
barriers to successful treatment; yet, the mechanisms responsible for their aggressive characteristics are not fully
defined. We show that a distinct population expressing CD133 (Prominin-1), which is highly enriched after
administration of a chemotherapeutic drug, dacarbazine, has enhanced metastatic potential in vivo. CD133þ
tumor cells are located close to tumor-associated lymphatic vessels in metastatic organs such as the regional
lymph nodes and lung. Lymphatic endothelial cells promote the migratory activity of a CD133þ subset to target
organs and regulation of lymphatic growth efficiently modulates the metastasis of CD133þ tumor cells. We
found that lymphatic vessels in metastatic tissues stimulate chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)þ/CD133þ cell
metastasis to target organs by secretion of stromal cell–derived factor-1 (SDF-1). The CXCR4þ/CD133þ cells
exhibited higher metastatic activity compared with CXCR4/CD133þ cells and, importantly, blockade of CXCR4
coupled with dacarbazine efficiently inhibited both tumor growth and metastasis; dacarbazine alone could not
attenuate tumor metastasis. The current study demonstrates a previously unidentified role of the lymphatic
microenvironment in facilitating metastasis of chemoresistant melanoma cells via a specific chemotactic axis,
SDF-1/CXCR4. Our findings suggest that targeting the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in addition to dacarbazine treatment
could therapeutically block chemoresistant CD133þ cell metastasis toward a lymphatic metastatic niche.

Introduction
Malignant melanoma is highly metastatic and notoriously
resistant to conventional therapies, posing a challenging
therapeutic obstacle attributed to tumor population heterogeneity (1, 2). Numerous clinical approaches have been suggested, including chemotherapy and immunologic therapies,
for treating melanoma (3, 4), but they have yet to produce a
remarkable therapeutic effect. Response rates to dacarbazine,
the most widely used agent for melanoma treatment, are
significantly low at 10% to 25% (5) and its administration

can rather enhance metastatic potential as well as tumorigenic properties in vivo (6). Although several molecular
mechanisms for drug resistance have been evaluated, such
as increased DNA repair and cytokine expression in melanoma, resistance to chemotherapy, and an induced, aggressive
metastatic phenotype remain as major challenges for melanoma treatment.
The existence of a rare tumor-initiating subpopulation that
exhibits resistance to conventional cancer therapies has been
proposed (7, 8). Recent studies in melanoma have addressed a
possible mechanism for tumor chemoresistance, identifying
drug transporter ABCB5 as a critical mediator of tumor
initiation as well as chemoresistance (9, 10). Although the
rarity of tumorigenic cells identified by specific surface markers has been challenged, especially in the context of melanoma (11–13), it remains unanswered whether distinct
subpopulations are more responsible for chemoresistance
than a heterogeneous population. Also, the molecular features
that characterize chemoresistant cells require further investigation.
Metastasis occurs in an organ-specific and highly organized
manner. Certain tumors are prone to metastasize to preferred
sites by diverse determinants such as intrinsic properties of
tumor cells and circulation patterns (14). Increasing evidences
have shown that the microenvironment at metastatic sites can
modulate metastatic potential (15). The molecular basis of
organ-specific metastasis is poorly understood, but local

microenvironmental components of metastatic sites can create a conducive niche for attracting tumor cells to favorable
organs (16). Chemokine-mediated mechanisms also govern
the pattern of metastasis to specific target organs, in that the
local expression of chemoattractants may guide chemokine
receptor–expressing tumor cells to specific target organs (17–
19). In addition to using blood vessels, solid tumors can also
utilize the lymphatic vasculature to disseminate tumor cells to
distant sites (20–22). In malignant melanoma, lymphatic
vessels represent the major route of metastatic dissemination
(23). Lymph node (LN) metastasis is the first step of tumor
dissemination for a variety of human cancers including melanoma. Although the degree of LN metastasis has long been
one of the criteria for determining the prognosis of human
cancers, the molecular mechanisms of lymphatic metastasis
are poorly understood (24). Whether the LNs encourage tumor
cell dissemination for further systemic metastasis also
remains to be determined. However, the LNs may provide a
supportive environment for tumor metastasis by increasing
the metastatic propensity of tumor cells (15). Regulation of
lymphatic vessel growth also affects pulmonary metastasis,
beyond regional LN metastasis, in mouse models of some
cancers (25, 26). Vascular growth factor (VEGF)-C, a lymphangiogenic factor, directly induces lung lymphangiogenesis
which promotes intralymphatic spread in the lungs (27).
Our goal was not to wade into the controversy about the
presence of melanoma stem cells to seed cancer growth but
rather to determine underlying mechanisms mediating active
metastasis of chemoresistant melanoma cells to specific
target organs. Here, we demonstrate that a lymphatic microenvironment at metastatic sites promotes the recruitment of
disseminating tumor cells with a particular affinity for CD133positive tumor cells, which are highly enriched after cytotoxic
drug treatment in vivo. Furthermore, we identify the stromal
cell–derived factor 1 (SDF-1)/chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)
axis to play a critical role in mediating metastasis of a
chemoresistant tumor subpopulation toward a lymphatic
niche in specific target organs, regional LNs and lungs.

Materials and Methods
Mice and tumor model
C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory
and bred in our pathogen-free animal facility. K14-VEGF-C
transgenic mice (FVB/N genetic background) were generated,
maintained as previously described (28), and transferred to
KAIST. They were backcrossed with the C57BL/6J strain for
F10–F11 generations before being used for this study. Animal
care and experimental procedures were performed under the
approval of the Animal Care Committee of KAIST. Mouse cell
line B16/F10 melanoma was obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). The cell line was cultured in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL)
containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS;
HyClone), penicillin, and streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in
plastic tissue culture dishes (Nunc) at 37 C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2. To generate a melanoma model, 1 

indicated number of sorted subpopulations from tumor were
orthotopically injected into intradermal dorsal skin of 7- to 8week-old male mice.
Tissue collection and histologic analysis
On the indicated days after tumor implantation or the
treatments, mice were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of a combination of anesthetics (80 mg/kg of ketamine
and 12 mg/kg of xylazine), and the size of tumors was
measured. Mice were perfused with PBS before tumors and
other tissues, including LNs, lungs, livers, and diaphragms,
were harvested. Tissues were fixed with 100% acetone at
20 C for 12 hours, paraffin-embedded and sectioned
(thickness ¼ 10 mm). After blocking with 5% goat serum
in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) for
1 hour at room temperature, the samples were incubated
overnight at 4 C with 1 or more of the following primary
antibodies: rat anti-mouse lymphatic vessel endothelial
hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1; Aprogen), rabbit antimouse LYVE-1 (AngioBio), hamster anti-mouse CD31 (Millipore), rat anti-mouse PNAd (BD Biosciences Pharmingen),
rabbit anti-mouse CD133 (Abcam), rat anti-mouse CD133
(eBioscience), mouse anti-MelanA (Abcam), mouse antinestin (Abcam), rat anti-mouse CD166 (eBioscience), rat
anti-mouse CXCR4 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), rat antimouse CXCR4 (R&D systems), rabbit anti-mouse CXCL12
(eBioscience), rabbit anti-human Prox-1 (ReliaTech), hamster anti-mouse podoplanin (AngioBio), or anti-mouse SMAa (Sigma). After several washes in PBST, the samples were
incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with the fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Fluorescent signals were visualized and digital images were
obtained using a Zeiss inverted microscope, ApoTome microscope, or LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with argon
and helium–neon lasers (Carl Zeiss). The morphometric measurements of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels in tumors
and LNs and metastatic cells in LNs and lungs were made on
sectioned tissues with immunostaining using photographic
analysis in ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) or a
Zeiss ApoTome microscope coupled to a monochrome
charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and image analysis
software (AxioVision, Zeiss). The number of metastasized
CD133þ/MelanAþ tumor cells in the axillary LN (ALN) was
measured on the mid-section. The measurements of MelanAþ
metastatic tumor colonies (>20 MelanAþ cells) in the lungs of
the tumor-bearing mice were made on the 3 randomly chosen
sections. Density measurements of LYVE-1þ lymphatic vessels
and CD31þ blood vessels in the tumors were made on 3 fields
in the intratumoral and peritumoral regions at a screen
magnification of 100, each 5.25 mm2 in area.
Flow cytometric analysis and sorting
Tumor tissues and lymph nodes were washed in PBS and
digested using 0.2% collagenase type-IV (Worthington) for 1
hour at 37 C. After digestion, cells were filtered 2 times by 40mm nylon meshes to remove cell clumps. Peripheral blood was
collected in a tube containing EDTA by cardiac puncture
under anesthesia. Red blood cells (RBC) were removed from

the peripheral blood using a RBC lysis buffer (Sigma) before
flow cytometric analysis. Cells were resuspended in Hank'sbuffered salt solution (HBSS) containing 2% FBS and stained
for 20 minutes on ice with 1 or more of the following antibodies: anti-mouse CD133 antibody (13A4, eBioscience), antimouse CXCR4 antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), antimouse CD45 antibody (30-F11, eBioscience), anti-mouse CD31
antibody (BioLegend), anti-mouse VEGFR-2 antibody
(eBioscience), or anti-mouse VEGFR-3 antibody (eBioscience).
Dead cells were excluded by 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD;
(Invitrogen). For sorting, cells were stained with above antibodies and sorted using fluorescence activated cell sorting
(FACS) Aria II (Becton Dickinson). Data were analyzed by
using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Migration assay and coculture study
For migration assays, 1  105 of HEK-293E cells (ATCC),
primary cultured HUVECs and lymphatic endothelial cells
(LEC; within 7–8 passages; Cambrex) were resuspended in
27 mL of DMEM containing 2% FBS and seeded in the lower
well of a Boyden Chamber before a polycarbonate membrane
was placed (8-mm pore size; Neuro Probe). A total of 2  104 of
sorted CD133þ or CD133 cells, which were resuspended in 50
mL of the same medium, were seeded in the upper chamber.
After 24 hours of incubation at 37 C, the nonmigrated cells on
the top of the filter were removed and the migrated cells on
the bottom of the filter were stained in hematoxylin and eosin
solution. The number of stained cells was counted under a
microscope. For a Matrigel coculture study, 2.5  104 of LECs
were resuspended in DMEM containing 2% FBS. A total of 1 
104 of sorted CD133þ or CD133 cells from tumor were
prelabeled with 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFDA SE; Invitrogen) and cocultured with LECs
on a Matrigel (60 mL per well)-coated 8-well chambered slide
(Nunc). For CXCR4 blocking experiments, 500 ng/mL of the
CXCR4 blocking antibody (R&D Systems) was treated after
seeding of mixed cells. After 24 hours of incubation at 37 C,
LECs and either prelabeled CD133þ or CD133 cells were
visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from the indicated cells and
tissues using an Easy-BLUE Total RNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON
Biotechnology) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Each cDNA was made with SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), and quantitative real-time PCR was performed with the indicated primers (Supplementary Table 1)
using iCycler (Bio-Rad) equipped with iQ5 (Bio-Rad). The realtime PCR data were analyzed with Bio-Rad iQ5 Optical System
Software (Bio-Rad).
Drug treatment
Seven days after tumor implantation, drug treatment was
started. For dacarbazine treatment, a treatment cycle consisted of an intraperitoneal injection of dacarbazine (25 mg/
kg, Sigma-Aldrich) after an epifocal application of dinitrochlorobenzene (dissolved in mixture of acetone and olive oil,
4:1) on the tumor. For the first cycle, the tumors were treated

www.aacrjournals.org

with 2% dinitrochlorobenzene; whereas, for the following
cycles, 1% dinitrochlorobenzene was used. Cycles were
repeated every 4 days. As a control, equal volumes of vehicle
were administered in the same manner. To block CXCR4, 1.25
mg/kg of AMD3100 (Sigma-Aldrich) was subcutaneously
administered every other day for 2 weeks. To block VEGFC/D, 1  109 pfu of adenoviral delivery of soluble VEGFR-3
(Ad-sVEGFR-3) or Ad-bgal was intravenously delivered starting from 3 days after tumor implantation once a week for
3 weeks.
Statistical analysis
Values are presented as mean  standard deviation (SD).
Significant differences between means were determined by
unpaired Student's t test or with 1-way ANOVA followed by the
Student–Newman–Keuls test. Statistical significance was set
at P < 0.05.

Results
A chemoresistant subpopulation expressing CD133
associates with lymphatic vessels in metastatic organs
Our preliminary study to see the effects of standard chemotherapy on melanoma metastasis following exposure of a
chemotherapeutic agent, dacarbazine, showed that metastases in ALN as a regional LN and lung as distant metastatic
organ were not attenuated even though tumor growth was
reduced by 43% (Supplementary Fig. S1A–C).
Immunostaining of primary tumors and ALNs for the lymphatic marker, LYVE-1, showed a preferential increase of
lymphatic vasculatures over blood vessels in dacarbazinetreated mice compared with vehicle-treated control (Supplementary Fig. S1D and F). However, any notable difference in the
pericyte coverage of blood vessels was not detectable between
dacarbazine-treated mice and vehicle-treated control (Supplementary Fig. S1E). Given these results, we sought to address the
possibility of the chemotherapeutic treatment for melanoma
leading to the enrichment of chemoresistant subpopulations
that could actively metastasize in a lymphatic system-dependent manner. As a subpopulation expressing Prominin-1
(CD133) is enriched after therapeutic treatment in some
cancers (7, 29), we examined the enrichment of CD133þ tumor
cells following exposure to dacarbazine after melanoma
implantation. Remarkably, dacarbazine treatment in vivo elevated the frequency of the CD133þ subpopulation by approximately 9-fold within the tumor population depleted of
hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors relative to vehicle-treated mice, showing high resistance of the CD133-expressing subset to the chemotherapeutic drug (Fig. 1A and B).
We next examined the metastatic potential of the CD133þ
subpopulation to ALNs and distant organs such as the lungs.
Flow cytometric analysis of homogenized lymph nodes after
tumor implantation showed that CD45/CD133þ cells consist
of up to 2.4% of total LN cells after CD31þ endothelial cell
depletion, whereas no CD45/CD133þ cells were detectable in
ALNs of control mice without tumor implantation (Supplementary Fig. S2A), implying that CD133þ cells are highly metastatic in nature. In addition, the frequency of melanoma-derived

CD45/CD133þ cells represented 0.06% of the total peripheral
blood cells, whereas CD45/CD133þ cells were very rare, if at all
detectable (<0.001%) in the peripheral blood of control mice
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). Using an antibody for MelanA, which
is prevalently expressed in melanocytes, we further found that
5.5% of metastasized MelanAþ cells in ALNs at 3 weeks after
melanoma cell implantation coexpressed CD133, whereas MelanAþ cells were rarely detected in the ALNs of vehicle-injected
control mice, confirming that the subpopulation expressing
CD133 has high metastatic potential. Of note, CD133þ tumor
cells were closely associated with LYVE-1þ lymphatic vessels
compared with PNAd-positive high endothelial venules (HEVs;
Fig. 1C and D). For the distant metastatic organ of melanoma, the

lungs in particular, immunostaining showed that the metastasized CD133þ/MelanAþ cells colocalize with other MelanAþ
tumorcells byformingcolonies (a colonydefined as >20 MelanAþ
cells). Interestingly, we observed a certain set of CD133þ tumor
cells closely encompass LYVE-1þ lymphatic vessels (Fig. 1E and
Supplementary Fig. S3B). We confirmed that LYVE-1þ vessel
structures are lymphatic vessels by coimmunostaining with
Prox-1 or podoplanin (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). Quantificational analysis showed that 20.2% of total MelanAþ tumor
colonies were located within 50 mm from lymphatic vessels
(Fig. 1F and G). These results based on LN and lung metastases
suggest that lymphatic vessels provide a favorable environment
for metastasis of CD133þ melanoma cells.

Lymphatic endothelial cells promote migration of
CD133þ melanoma cells
To validate that lymphatic vessels promote the migration of
CD133þ tumor cells, we next investigated whether primary
cultured LECs facilitate the migratory activity of CD133þ
melanoma cells using an in vitro Boyden chamber assay
(Fig. 2A). Control cells, HUVECs and HEK-293E cells, did
not significantly affect the migration of either CD133þ or
CD133 cells (Fig. 2B and C). However, compared with
HUVECs, LECs robustly promoted (7.2-fold) the migratory
activity of CD133þ tumor cells rather than CD133 cells (1.8fold; Fig. 2B and C). This result demonstrates that LECs play a
substantial role in mediating the migration of CD133þ melanoma cells.
Lymphatic vessels regulate metastasis of CD133þ tumor
cells in vivo
On the basis of aforementioned findings, we questioned
whether the modulation of lymphatic growth could regulate
CD133þ tumor cell metastasis in vivo. To answer this question,
we reduced lymphatic growth through the blockade of VEGF-C/
VEGFR-3 signaling by Ad-sVEGFR-3 (30). Conversely, K14VEGF-C transgenic mice (28), which have dense and enlarged
lymphatic vessels in the skin dermis, were used to see the effects

of increased lymphatic growth in tumor metastasis. As we
expected, Ad-sVEGFR-3 delivery reduced both lymphatic density and blood vessel density in tumor, compared with adenoviral bgal delivery (Ad-bgal); whereas melanoma-bearing K14VEGF-C transgenic mice showed a profound increase in lymphatic density in tumor, compared with wild-type (WT) littermate mice (Supplementary Fig. S4C–F). Growth of lymphatic
vessels rather than blood vessels was remarkably decreased in
ALNs after Ad-sVEGFR-3 treatment and, in an adverse manner,
K14-VEGF-C transgenic mice showed a significant increase in
lymphatic density in ALNs (Fig. 3A and B and Supplementary
Fig. S4G). Both Ad-sVEGFR-3 treatment and K14-VEGF-C transgenic phenotype had no impact on either tumor growth or
percentage of CD133þ cell population in tumor (Supplementary
Fig. S4A and B). Importantly, CD133þ/MelanAþ cell metastasis
to ALNs was 81% less after administration of Ad-sVEGFR-3
compared with Ad-bgal, but it was increased approximately 2.4fold in K14-VEGF-C transgenic mice compared with WT mice
with melanoma (Fig. 3C–E).
Moreover, compared with Ad-bgal, the number of tumor
colonies was 85% less in Ad-sVEGFR-3–treated mice whereas
pulmonary metastasis increased approximately 2.1-fold in the
lungs of K14-VEGF-C transgenic mice (Fig. 3F). Interestingly,

and CD133 cells of developed tumor revealed that the mRNA
expression levels of lymphangiogenic factors, such as VEGF-C
and VEGF-A, were higher in CD133þ cells compared with
CD133 cells in tumor (Fig. 3G). In addition, flow cytometric
analysis revealed that only 2.6% and 3.8% of CD45/
CD133þ tumor cells expressed VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, respectively, in tumor (Supplementary Fig. S5). Our results suggest
that VEGF-C and VEGF-A released from CD133þ melanoma
cells may be actively participating in promoting lymphangiogenesis, therefore facilitating tumor metastasis through lymphatic vessels.
SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is involved in CD133þ tumor cell
metastasis toward a lymphatic metastatic niche
Because a strong correlation between tumor metastasis and
SDF-1 expression in target organs is reported in some cancers
(18), we next investigated whether the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is
involved in the interaction between CD133þ cells and lymphatic vessels, and contributes to forming a lymphatic meta-

purpose, we first examined the expression of SDF-1 on lymphatic vessels in metastatic tissues. Immunofluorescence

whereas its expression was weak and undetectable in lymphatic vessels of normal ALNs of mice without tumor implantation (Fig. 4A). Strong SDF-1 expression was also observed in
lymphatic vessels of either primary tumor or metastasized
lungs, but not in other tissues of the melanoma-bearing mice
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). In agreement with these findings,
SDF-1 and VEGFR-3 mRNA expression levels were, respectively, approximately 6.6- and 3.8-fold higher in the ALNs and
were approximately 3.8- and 2.2-fold higher in lung tissues of
melanoma-bearing mice compared with normal mice (Supplementary Fig. S6B). However, their expression levels were
not significantly changed in other organs, such as liver, spleen,
and testis, in which metastasis was infrequently observed after
tumor implantation (Supplementary Fig. S6B and data not

CXCR4, a specific receptor for SDF-1, particularly in CD133þ
melanoma cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that a
distinct population of CD133þ cells (57.9%) expressed CXCR4
in tumor (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, immunofluorescence costaining confirmed that a certain set of CD133þ/MelanAþ cells
in the ALNs express CXCR4 (Fig. 4C). On the basis of these
findings, we hypothesized that the CXCR4-expressing CD133þ
tumor cells may have high metastatic activity. To test this
hypothesis, we isolated CXCR4þ/CD133þ and CXCR4/

Blockade of CXCR4 signaling reduces physical
association of CD133þ cells to LECs
To demonstrate whether CXCR4 signaling is a responsible
mediator for physical association between CD133þ tumor
cells and LECs, freshly isolated CD133þ and CD133 cells
from tumor were labeled with a green fluorescent dye CFDASE and cocultured with LECs in Matrigel for 24 hours. We
observed that, compared with CD133 cells, CD133þ tumor
cells associated more closely with LECs (Fig. 5A and B).
Importantly, blockade of CXCR4 with anti-CXCR4 blocking
antibody significantly impaired the association between
CD133þ tumor cells and LECs by 25%, whereas the association
between CD133 tumor cells and LECs was only slightly
affected after CXCR4 blockade (Fig. 5A and B).
Blockade of CXCR4 signaling suppresses tumor
metastasis to the ALNs and lungs
To confirm that CXCR4 signaling is responsible for melanoma metastasis, especially of the chemoresistant CD133þ
cells, we administered a CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 and a
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent dacarbazine 1 week after
melanoma implantation. Blocking CXCR4 signaling with
AMD3100 did not significantly affect either tumor growth
or percentage of CD133þ cell population in tumor (Fig. 6A–C),
but it significantly reduced CD133þ tumor cell metastasis to
ALNs and pulmonary metastasis, compared with the vehicle
(Fig. 6D–G). The number of tumor cells surrounding lymphatic vessels in the lungs was also reduced by AMD3100 treatment (Fig. 6E). In comparison, dacarbazine alone or combined

10418

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

treatment of AMD3100 plus dacarbazine increased the percentage of CD133þ cell population in tumor by approximately
5.8- and 5.7-fold, respectively, compared with the vehicle
(Fig. 6C). In terms of metastasis, as we expected, dacarbazine
treatment alone could not block metastasis to the ALNs and
lungs although it reduced tumor growth by 55% (Fig. 6A and
B). However, importantly, combined treatment of AMD3100
plus dacarbazine showed a significant reduction in tumor
metastasis either to ALNs by 62% or to lungs by 49% and also
induced a decrease in the number of tumor cells surrounding
lymphatic vessels in the lungs (Fig. 6D–G). Together, our
results confirm that CXCR4 signaling is a crucial pathway
in regulating metastatic activity of chemoresistant CD133þ
tumor cells toward a lymphatic niche in target metastatic
organs (Supplementary Fig. S7). Therefore, the blockade of
CXCR4 signaling plus dacarbazine administration suppresses
the highly metastatic phenotype of melanoma, which remains
as a significant problem with dacarbazine treatment alone.

Discussion
The underlying mechanisms of highly metastatic and chemoresistant characteristics of malignant melanomas are still
poorly understood for the development of an effective treatment. Our study identifies a distinct population expressing
CD133 (Prominin-1) that is highly enriched after repeated
exposure of a chemotherapeutic drug, which may lead to
the selection of certain tumor subsets. Importantly, our data
demonstrate that lymphatic microenvironments actively
regulate metastasis of CD133þ cells with high metastatic
potential by a specific signaling pathway in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S7).

CD133þ tumor cells represent the cellular population that
confers radio and chemoresistance and could be the source of
tumor recurrence after therapeutic treatments (7, 31). Our
study confirmed that, in vivo, the CD133þ subpopulation is
highly enriched in a melanoma model after administration of
dacarbazine, which is generally considered to be the most
active agent for treating malignant melanoma. Our goal was
not to determine whether chemotherapeutic resistance correlates with the ability of melanoma subsets to form tumors,
but rather to elucidate precise mechanisms determining the
directional metastasis of CD133þ tumor cells to specific target
organs. It is reported that angiogenesis and metastasis are
enhanced after dacarbazine administration to melanoma (6).
Our data further identified that lymphatic growth, both in

tumor and in regional LNs, increased after dacarbazine treatment in vivo. These observations led us to examine the potential role of lymphatic vessels as microenvironments to guide
metastatic CD133þ tumor cells with chemoresistance to target
organs. Previous reports have shown that tumor-associated
cells, such as hematopoietic progenitor cells and inflammatory
cells, create a conducive microenvironment for tumor metastasis (32, 33). In our study, we discovered that the distribution
of CD133þ/MelanAþ tumor cells is primarily toward lymphatic
vessels in metastasized LNs, suggesting that tumor-associated
lymphatic vasculature in LNs can establish proper environments to promote the metastasis of CD133þ tumor cells. For
the preferred target organ of melanoma metastasis, the lungs,
CD133þ/MelanAþ cells colocalized with other MelanAþ tumor

cells by forming colonies. Also, as we emphasize in this study, a
certain set of CD133þ tumor cells was observed to closely
surround lymphatic vessels in the metastasized lung. This
phenomenon suggests the role of lymphatic vasculature in
facilitating lymphatic spread of CD133þ melanoma cells in the
lungs. Notably, we found that reduction or promotion of
lymphatic vessel growth, respectively, attenuated or enhanced
CD133þ cell metastasis to the regional LN and lung metastasis.
Moreover, the number of MelanAþ tumor cells that closely
reside adjacent to lymphatic vessels decreased in the lung after
Ad-sVEGFR-3 treatment (data not shown). The modulation of
lymphatic growth, however, did not affect the percentage of
CD133þ population in tumor, implying that lymphatic vessels
do not regulate the maintenance of CD133þ tumor cells but
rather are principally responsible for CD133þ melanoma cell
metastasis. Furthermore, CD133þ cells were observed to
express higher mRNA levels of lymphangiogenic factors,
VEGF-C and VEGF-A, compared with CD133 cells in tumor.
These results explain that CD133þ melanoma cells can promote lymphangiogenesis in metastatic tissues as well as in
primary tumor by strongly expressing lymphangiogenic factors, therefore facilitating tumor metastasis through the lymphatic system.
Tumor metastasis is a dynamic process involving multiple
molecular and cellular mechanisms (34). Recent studies have
shown that local molecular and cellular components of metastatic tissues can create a favorable niche and adjust the
metastatic activity of disseminating tumor cells to favorable
organs (15, 16). Chemokine-mediated mechanisms have also
been proposed to promote metastasis to specific target destinations by acting directly on tumor cell migration. For example, the chemokine CCL21 released from LECs stimulates the
migration of melanoma cells into the lymphatic system (19).
The SDF-1/CXCR4 axis mainly implicates homing of stem
cells into the bone marrow (35). Previous studies have indicated a strong correlation between the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and
tumor metastasis and have demonstrated that the gradient of
SDF-1 expression can regulate tumor cell invasion to specific
anatomic sites (17, 18). Indeed, our results revealed that
expression levels of SDF-1 mRNA are highly increased in
preferred metastatic sites such as LNs and lungs. Furthermore,
as a novel source for SDF-1, lymphatic vessels either in tumor
or in metastatic sites were observed to strongly express SDF-1
compared with nontumor-bearing mice. In tumor, a high
frequency of CD133þ cells (60%) was seen to express CXCR4,
indicating that SDF-1 in metastatic tissues may create receptive microenvironments for the recruitment of CXCR4-expressing CD133þ cells from the primary tumoral region. At the
same time, this result suggests that a distinct population of
CD133þ cells has high metastatic activity by expressing

CXCR4. Indeed, further studies based on this finding demonstrated that CXCR4-expressing CD133þ cells exhibit enhanced
metastasis compared with CXCR4/CD133þ cells in vivo. Our
findings show that CXCR4 importantly mediates chemotactic
and metastatic responses of CD133þ cells in vivo. As discussed
above, treatment of melanoma gives rise to poor response
rates resulting from a highly resistant and metastatic phenotype. Our results correspondingly show that dacarbazine does
not attenuate LN and pulmonary metastases, despite its ability
to reduce tumor growth. Considering our results, the blockade
of CXCR4 signaling coupled with dacarbazine treatment in
vivo is promising as a new therapeutic strategy for treating
melanoma. Specifically, blocking the CXCR4 signaling in addition to dacarbazine administration significantly impaired
CD133þ cell migration, resulting in decreased LN and pulmonary metastases.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the role of a lymphatic microenvironment at preferred metastatic sites in
guiding metastasis of a distinct tumor subset expressing
CD133 that is enriched after dacarbazine treatment. Here,
the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is essential for the functionality of the
lymphatic metastatic niche that attracts CXCR4-expressing
tumor cells. We unraveled the role of lymphatic vessels as a
novel source of SDF-1, which promotes the metastasis of
CXCR4-expressing CD133þ cells (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Importantly, the blockade of CXCR4 signaling coupled with
dacarbazine treatment impaired LN and pulmonary metastases as well as tumor growth. Thus, our findings suggest that
targeting the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, a key regulator of the lymphatic niche, will lead to a novel combinational therapy with
dacarbazine by blocking the metastasis of chemoresistant
CD133þ cells.
