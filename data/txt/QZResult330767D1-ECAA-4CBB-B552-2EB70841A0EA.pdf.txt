ABSTRACT
Cadmium (Cd), an environmental contaminant, causes neurodegenerative
disorders. Recently we have shown that rapamycin prevents Cd-induced neuronal cell
death by inhibiting mTOR signaling pathway. Here we found that rapamycin exerted
its prevention against Cd-induced neuronal cell death also partially via blocking
Erk1/2 pathway. Inhibiting Erk1/2 with PD98059 or silencing Erk1/2 potentiated
rapamycin’s inhibition of Cd-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and apoptosis in
neuronal cells. Both PP2A and PTEN/Akt were involved in the regulation of Erk1/2
activation and cell death triggered by Cd. Inhibition of PP2A with okadaic acid or
ectopic expression of dominant negative PP2A attenuated rapamycin’s inhibition of
Cd-induced phospho-Erk1/2 and apoptosis, whereas over-expression of wild-type
PP2A enhanced rapamycin’s effects; Over-expression of wild-type PTEN or dominant
negative Akt, or inhibition of Akt with Akt inhibitor X strengthened rapamycin’s
inhibition of Cd-induced phospho-Erk1/2 and cell death. Furthermore, expression
of a rapamycin-resistant and kinase-active mTOR (mTOR-T) blocked rapamycin’s
inhibitory effects on Cd-induced inhibition of PP2A, down-regulation of PTEN, and
activation of Akt, leading to Erk1/2 activation and cell death, whereas silencing
mTOR mimicked rapamycin’s effects. The results uncover that rapamycin inhibits Cd
activation of Erk1/2-mediated neuronal apoptosis through intervening mTOR-PP2A/
PTEN signaling network.

disabilities and hyperactivity in children, olfactory
dysfunction, and neurobehavioural defects in attention,
psychomotor speed and memory in workers [9–12].
Cerebral cortical and hippocampal neurons have been
identified as targets of Cd toxicity and Cd-induced cell
apoptosis [8, 12–14]. Overwhelming evidence has
demonstrated that Cd-poisoning is a possible etiological
factor in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s
disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis [7, 9, 12, 15].

INTRODUCTION
Cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal with very strong
accumulation in human body, has a long biological half-life
(15–20 years) mainly due to its low rate of excretion from
the body [1]. Clinical and epidemiological data have shown
that Cd exerts toxic effects not only on the kidneys [2],
liver [3, 4], lung [5] and testis [6] but also on the central
nervous system (CNS) [7–9]. Prolonged exposure to
Cd results in the dysfunction of CNS such as learning

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/
threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase, functions as two complexes
(mTORC1 and mTORC2) in mammalian cells [16, 17].
mTORC1 phosphorylates ribosomal p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)
and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein
1 (4E-BP1) [16, 17], whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates
Akt on Ser473 [18]. In addition to phosphorylation
on Ser473, Akt activity is also positively regulated
by phosphorylation on Thr308 by phosphoinositidedependent kinase 1 (PDK1), which requires activation
of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) [16–19].
Activated Akt also positively regulates mTOR, leading to
increased phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 [20, 21].
The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is negatively regulated by
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome
10), a dual specificity protein and lipid phosphatase [20–22].
Though more functions of the mTOR complexes may be
identified, current knowledge indicates that mTOR plays a
crucial role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation,
differentiation, survival, and motility [16, 17].
Numerous studies have demonstrated that mTOR
regulates differentiation and survival in neurons, and
plays an important role in synaptic plasticity, learning and
memory, and food uptake in adult brain [23, 24]. mTOR
activity is modified in various pathologic states of the
nervous system, including brain tumors, tuberous sclerosis,
cortical displasia and neurodegenerative disorders such
as PD, AD, and Huntington’s disease (HD) [24]. Active
Akt, as a major regulator of neuronal cell survival [25], is
negatively associated with dopaminergic neurodegeneration
in PD [26, 27]. We have recently found that Cd induces
neuronal apoptosis via down-regulation of PTEN and
activation of Akt/mTOR signaling pathway [12, 20,
28, 29]. Rapamycin, a macrocyclic lactone, is a potent
and specific mTORC1 inhibitor [30]. Mounting data have
indicated that mTORC1 is sensitive to short rapamycin
exposure [16, 17]. However, the effect of rapamycin on
mTORC2-mediated Akt phosphorylation depends on the
concentration and duration of rapamycin treatment [31].
Our group has demonstrated that pretreatment with
rapamycin in vitro for 48 h prevents Cd-induced neuronal
cell death by inhibiting Akt/mTOR signaling pathway [20].
Administration of rapamycin in vivo also potently attenuates
Cd-induced activation of Akt/mTOR signaling, brain
damage and neuron death in mice [12].
In mammalian cells, there exist at least three distinct
groups of MAPKs, including the extracellular signalregulated kinases ERK1/2, ERK3/4, ERK5, ERK7/8, the
Jun N-terminal kinases JNK1/2/3, and the p38 MAPKs
p38α/β/γ/δ [32]. Multiple studies have reported that
sustained activation of Erk1/2, JNK and/or p38 MAPK
contribute to Cd-induced apoptosis in various types of
cells, including neuronal cells [33, 34]. Our previous
studies have shown that all three MAPK members can be
activated by Cd in neuronal cells, and Cd-induced neuronal
apoptosis is only partially attributed to activation of Erk1/2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and JNK, but not p38 [28]. As protein phosphatases 2A
(PP2A) negatively regulates Erk1/2 pathway through
dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 [35], we have also found
that Cd induces activation of Erk1/2 contributing to
neuronal apoptosis via inhibition of PP2A activity [36].
As mentioned above, PTEN negatively regulates Akt/
mTOR pathway [22, 29, 37]. We have observed that Cd
can down-regulate PTEN protein expression, leading to
activation of Akt/mTOR signaling in PC12 cells [20].
Interestingly, emerging evidence has suggested that PTEN
may also negatively regulate Erk1/2 pathway in several
malignancies [38]. In addition, PI3K/Akt may activate
Erk1/2 through PKC [38]. mTOR negatively regulates
PP2A, and rapamycin can activate PP2A [39]. Based
on the above findings, we hypothesized that rapamycin
inhibits Cd activation of Erk1/2 pathway via activating
PP2A and PTEN network, thereby preventing neuronal
cell apoptosis.
Here we show that rapamycin inhibits Cd-induced
neuronal cell death in part by suppressing Erk1/2 pathway.
Mechanistically, rapamycin blocks Cd activation of Erk1/2,
not only by preventing Cd inhibition of PP2A, but also via
blocking Cd down-regulation of PTEN and activation of
Akt in neuronal cells in an mTOR kinase activity-dependent
manner. Our findings underline a potential beneficial role of
rapamycin in the prevention and/or treatment of Cd-induced
neurodegenerative disorders.

RESULTS
Rapamycin attenuates Cd-induced neuronal
apoptosis by blocking Erk1/2 pathway
We have recently demonstrated that Cd induces
neuronal apoptosis in part through activation of mTOR/
MAPK signaling network [28, 36, 40], and inhibition
of mTOR by rapamycin in vitro and in vivo prevents
Cd-induced neurotoxicity [12, 28]. In line with the
above findings, here we also observed that pretreatment
with rapamycin (200 ng/ml) for 48 h attenuated the cell
viability reduction and morphological change induced
by 24-h exposure to Cd (10 and/or 20 μM), as detected
by trypan blue exclusion in PC12 cells (Figure 1A) and
morphological analysis in PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells
and primary neurons (Figure 1B), respectively. Next,
we evaluated the cells with nuclear fragmentation and
condensation, a hallmark of apoptosis [41], using DAPI
staining, and concurrently analyzed DNA strand breaks
in the cells by TUNEL staining (Figure 1C). Imaged
and quantified results showed that pretreatment with
rapamycin significantly reduced the percentage of the cells
with nuclear fragmentation and condensation (arrows)
and the number of TUNEL-positive cells with fragmented
DNA (in green) in PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells and primary
neurons triggered by Cd exposure, compared with the
control (Figure 1C–1E).

neurons were pretreated with rapamycin (Rap, 200 ng/ml) for 48 h, and then exposed to Cd (10 and/or 20 μM) for 24 h. A. Live cells were
detected by counting viable cells using trypan blue exclusion. B. Cell morphological changes were visualized under an Olympus inverted
phase-contrast microscope (200 ×) equipped with Quick Imaging system. Scale bar: 50 μm. C. Apoptotic cells were evaluated by nuclear
fragmentation and condensation (arrows) using DAPI staining (upper panel) and concurrently by in situ detection of fragmented DNA
(in green) using TUNEL staining (lower panel). Scale bar: 20 μm. D and E. The percentages of cells with fragmented nuclei (D) and the
number of TUNEL-positive cells (E) were quantified, showing that rapamycin dramatically attenuated Cd-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells,
SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons. For (A), (D), and (E), all data were expressed as means ± SE (n = 5). aP < 0.05, difference with control
group; bP < 0.05, difference with 10 μM Cd group; cP < 0.05, difference with 20 μM Cd group.

In addition, using Western blot analysis, we also
investigated the cleavage of caspase-3 in PC12 cells,
SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons. The results
revealed that rapamycin potently blocked Cd-elicited
robust cleavage of caspase-3 in the cells (Figure 2A).
Interestingly, we also found that rapamycin obviously
suppressed Cd-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2
(Figure 2A), hinting that rapamycin may inhibit
Cd-induced activation of Erk1/2 pathway, preventing
Cd-induced cell death. To confirm this finding, we next
conducted p-Erk1/2 immunofluorescence staining and
caspase3/7 activity assay in PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells
and primary neurons, respectively. Treatment of the cells
with Cd (10 and 20 μM) for 24 h induced remarkable
phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (in green),
which was obviously diminished by rapamycin
pretreatment (Figure 2B and 2C). Consistently,
rapamycin substantially blocked Cd-induced activation
of caspases 3/7 in the cells (Figure 2D).
To validate the observation that rapamycin inhibition
of Cd-induced cell apoptosis is linked to the blockage of
Erk1/2 activation, PC12 cells and primary neurons were
pre-incubated with/without PD98059 (a selective inhibitor
of MAPK kinases 1/2 (MEK1/2), upstream of Erk1/2)
alone, or in combination with rapamycin. We found
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that PD98059 (2–15 μM) concentration-dependently
inhibited Cd-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in
the cells (Figure  3A). PD98059 (10 μM) or rapamycin
(200 ng/ml) alone obviously suppressed the
phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and the cleavage of caspase-3 in
the cells induced by Cd exposure (Figure 3B). Especially,
co-treatment with rapamycin/PD98059 exhibited a
stronger inhibitory effect on Cd-induced phospho-Erk1/2
and cleaved-caspase-3 (Figure 3B). Consistently, the
combination of rapamycin with PD98059 also exhibited
more potent inhibition of Cd-triggered cell apoptosis than
rapamycin or PD98059 alone (Figure 3C).
To further corroborate the role of Erk1/2 in
rapamycin’s inhibition of Cd-induced neuronal apoptosis,
Erk1/2 was silenced by RNA interference. As detected by
Western blotting (Figure 3D), lentiviral shRNA to Erk1/2,
but not to GFP, down-regulated expression of Erk1/2 by
~90% in PC12 cells. Silencing Erk1/2 almost completely
blocked Cd-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and
cleavage of caspase-3 (Figure 3D). Consistently, downregulation of Erk1/2 conferred significant resistance to
Cd-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells as well (Figure 3E).
Importantly, addition of rapamycin rendered the cells more
resistant to Cd treatment (Figure 3D and 3E). The results
clearly indicate that rapamycin attenuates Cd-induced

at least three independent experiments. For (C) and (D), all data were expressed as means ± SE (n = 5). aP < 0.05, difference with control

neuronal cells.

with/without rapamycin (200 ng/ml) for 48 h, and then
exposed to Cd (10 and 20 μM) for 4 h, following by
Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 4A, Cd and/or
rapamycin did not apparently alter cellular protein levels of
PP2Ac. However, pretreatment with rapamcyin obviously
suppressed Cd-increased expression of demethylatedPP2A and phospho-PP2A (Figure 4A), two events that are
related to decreased activity of PP2A [42], implying that
rapamycin may inhibit Cd-induced activation of Erk1/2
and cell death partially by preventing Cd from inactivating
PP2A in the neuronal cells.
To substantiate the role and significance of PP2A
in rapamycin’s inhibition of Cd-induced phospho-Erk1/2
and neuronal cell apoptosis, we used okadaic acid,
a relatively specific PP2A inhibitor [43]. Because okadaic
acid, at concentrations up to 100 nM, functions only as a
selective inhibitor of PP2A without inhibiting PP1 in intact
cells [43], PC2 cells, SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons

Rapamycin prevents Cd-induced activation of
Erk1/2 and apoptosis in part by blocking Cd
inhibition of PP2A in neuronal cells
It has been described that rapamycin can activate
PP2A [39]. PP2A negatively regulates Erk1/2 pathway
through dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 [35]. Our recent
studies have demonstrated that Cd activates Erk1/2
pathway leading to apoptosis by inactivation of PP2A
in neuronal cells [36], and the current study has found
that rapamycin blocked Cd-induced activation of Erk1/2
pathway (Figures 2 and 3). Therefore, we postulated that
rapamycin may inhibit Cd-activated Erk1/2 pathway by
preventing Cd from inhibiting PP2A. To this end, PC12
cells, SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons were pretreated

for 48 h, and then with/without okadaic acid (100 nM)
for 1 h, followed by exposure to Cd (10 μM) for 4 h or
24 h. As shown in Figure 4B, Cd markedly induced the
expression of demethylated-PP2Ac, phospho-PP2Ac and
phospho-Erk1/2 in the absence or presence of okadaic
acid. The effects appeared more potent in the cells
co-treated with Cd/okadaic acid than in the ones treated
with Cd or okadaic acid alone (Figure 4B). Okadaic acid
alone elevated the basal levels of demethylated-PP2Ac,
phospho-PP2Ac and phospho-Erk1/2 in the absence
of rapamycin, and especially reversed the inhibitory
effect of rapamycin on Cd-elicited events (Figure 4B).
Furthermore, rapamycin inhibited the basal or Cd-induced
cleaved-caspase-3 and cell apoptosis in PC12 cells,
SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons (Figure 4B and 4C).
Okadaic acid alone significantly elevated the basal level
of cell apoptosis and obviously strengthened Cd-induced
apoptotic event (Figure 4B and 4C). Of note, okadaic
acid conferred high resistance to rapamycin’s inhibition
of Cd-induced apoptosis in the cells (Figure 4B and 4C).
These results support the notion that rapamycin inhibits
Cd-induced Erk1/2 activation and apoptosis in part by
activating PP2A in neuronal cells.
To confirm the above findings, PC12 cells,
infected with Ad-dn-PP2A, Ad-PP2A and Ad-GFP
(as control), respectively, were exposed to Cd (10 μM)
for 4 h or 24 h following pretreatment with/without
rapamycin (200 ng/ml) for 48 h or PD98059 (10 μM)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for 1 h. As expected, a high level of HA-tagged dn-PP2A
or FLAG-tagged PP2A-wt was seen in Ad-dn-PP2A- or
Ad-PP2A-infected cells, but not in Ad-GFP-infected
cells (control) (Figure 5A and 5D). Cd exposure was able
to trigger phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in PC12/Ad-GFP
and PC12/Ad-dn-PP2A cells (Figure 5A). Ectopic
expression of dn-PP2A attenuated the inhibitory
effect of rapamycin on Cd-induced phospho-Erk1/2,
cleaved-caspase-3 and cell death (Figure 5A–5C).
However, the cells expressing dn-PP2A remained sensitive
to an Erk1/2 inhibitor, PD98059 (Figure 5A–5C). In
contrast, over-expression of wild-type PP2A powerfully
inhibited Cd-induced phospho-Erk1/2, cleaved-caspase-3
and cell apoptosis in the presence or absence of rapamycin,
as detected by Western blotting, as well as live cell assay
and DAPI staining (Figure 5D–5F). Taken together, our
data strongly support that rapamycin blocks Cd-induced
Erk1/2 activation and cell apoptosis in part via activation
of PP2A in neuronal cells.

Rapamycin prevents Cd-induced Erk1/2
activation and apoptosis also in part by blocking
Cd down-regulation of PTEN and activation of
Akt in neuronal cells
It is well-known that PTEN negatively regulates
Akt-mTOR pathway [22, 29, 37]. Emerging studies
have suggested that PTEN may also negatively regulate
Erk1/2 pathway in several malignancies [38]. In addition,

or Cd/okadaic acid group.

PI3K/Akt may activate Erk1/2 through PKC [38]. Our
recent studies have found that Cd down-regulation of
PTEN results in activation of Akt/mTOR signaling
and apoptosis of neuronal cells, which is attenuated by
rapamycin [20]. Here, we hypothesized that rapamycin
might block Cd-induced Erk1/2 activation and apoptosis
also by modulating PTEN-Akt signaling in neuronal
cells. In line with our previous finding [20], pretreatment
with rapamycin (200 ng/ml) for 48 h potently prevented
Cd-induced decrease of PTEN expression in PC12
cells, SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons (Figure 6A).
PC12 cells, infected with recombinant adenoviruses
expressing wild-type human PTEN (Ad-PTEN) or
Ad-GFP (as control), were pretreated with/without
rapamycin (200 ng/ml) for 48 h or Akt inhibitor X (20 μM)
for 1 h, followed by exposure to Cd (10 μM) for 4 h or 24 h.
We observed that the infection with Ad-PTEN increased
the expression of PTEN and slightly inhibited the basal
levels of phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473 and Thr308),
compared to the infection with Ad-GFP (Figure 6B). As
expected, treatment with Cd decreased PTEN expression,
and correspondingly increased phosphorylation of Akt

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and Erk1/2 in the control cells infected with Ad-GFP
(Lane 4 vs. Lane 1). Over-expression of PTEN blocked
Cd-induced phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 (Lane 10 vs.
Lane 4) (Figure 6B). Rapamycin, but not Akt inhibitor X,
attenuated Cd-induced decrease in PTEN expression;
both rapamycin and Akt inhibitor X diminished
Cd-induced increase in Akt/Erk1/2 phosphorylation
(Lane 5 vs. Lane 4, Lane 6 vs. Lane 4). Furthermore, overexpression of PTEN was able to potentiate the inhibitory
effects of rapamycin or Akt inhibitor X on Cd-induced
phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 (Lane 11 vs. Lane 5,
Lane 12 vs. Lane 6). Moreover, over-expression of PTEN
also enhanced the protective effect of rapamycin or Akt
inhibitor X against Cd-induced cleavage of caspase-3
(Lane 11 vs. Lane 5, Lane 12 vs. Lane 6) (Figure 6B).
By live cell assay and DAPI staining, we observed that
over-expression of PTEN alone partially prevented
Cd-induced cell apoptosis in PC12 cells (Figure 6C and 6D).
Addition of rapamycin or Akt inhibitor X elicited more
significant protection against Cd-induced cell apoptosis
(Figure 6C and 6D). Collectively, the findings support the
notion that rapamycin inhibits Cd-induced activation of

blockage of Cd-induced Erk1/2 activation and apoptosis
in neuronal cells, recombinant adenovirus expressing
HA-tagged dominant negative Akt (Ad-dn-Akt)
was utilized. As shown in Figure 6E, a high level of
HA-tagged Akt mutant was seen in PC12 cells infected
with Ad-dn-Akt, but not in the cells infected with
Ad-GFP (control virus). Over-expression of dn-Akt
remarkably suppressed Cd-triggered phosphorylation

PD98059 obviously inhibited Cd-induced Erk1/2
phosphorylation (Figure 6E). Interestingly, overexpression of dn-Akt was able to strengthen the
inhibitory effects of rapamycin or PD98059 on
Cd-induced phosphorylation of Akt or Erk1/2 (Figure 6E).
Consistently, over-expression of dn-Akt also potently
reinforced the preventive effects of rapamycin or
PD98059 against Cd-induced cleavage of caspase-3
(Figure 6E), as well as cell apoptosis in PC12 cells
(Figure 6F and 6G). These data clearly indicate that
rapamycin blocks Cd-induced Erk1/2 activation
and apoptosis by preventing Cd activation of Akt in
neuronal cells.

of Cd-induced phospho-Erk1/2 in PC12 cells (B and E). C and F. Live cells were detected by counting viable cells using trypan blue

followed by exposure to Cd (10 μM) for 4 h or 24 h. The
function of Ad-mTOR-T was confirmed by determining
the expression of FLAG-tagged mTOR mutant and the
phosphorylation level of S6K1. We observed that ectopic
expression of FLAG-tagged mTOR-T, but not GFP,
conferred high resistance to rapamycin inhibition of
phosphorylation of S6K1 in PC12 cells (Figure 7A), as
seen in other cell lines [44, 45]. Of interest, expression
of FLAG-mTOR-T, but not GFP, rendered substantial
resistance to rapamycin’s inhibitory effects on Cd-induced
demethylated-PP2Ac, phospho-PP2Ac, down-regulated
PTEN, phospho-Akt, phospho-Erk1/2 and cleavedcaspase-3, leading to reduced apoptosis in Cd-exposed
PC12 cells (Figure 7A–7C), implying that rapamycin
activates PP2A, upregulates PTEN and inactivates Akt,

To uncover whether rapamycin prevents Cd-induced
inactivation of PP2A, down-regulation of PTEN, and
activation of Akt, leading to suppression of Cd-induced
Erk1/2 activation and neuronal apoptosis, is through
inhibition of mTOR activity, PC12 cells were infected with
recombinant adenoviruses expressing GFP (Ad-GFP, as

respectively, were pretreated with/without rapamycin (Rap, 200 ng/ml) for 48 h, followed by exposure to Cd (10 μM) for 4 h (for Western

thereby inhibiting Cd-induced activation of Erk1/2, as
well as neuronal apoptosis, in an mTOR kinase activitydependent manner.
We also confirmed the above findings using RNA
interference. As demonstrated in Figure 7D, lentiviral
shRNA to mTOR, but not GFP, silenced expression of

mTOR protein by ~90% in PC12 cells, as detected by
Western blotting. Down-regulation of mTOR significantly
decreased the mTOR kinase activity, since the basal or
Cd-induced phosphorylation of S6K1 (Thr389), routinely
used as an indicator of mTOR kinase activity [16, 17], was
almost not detectable by Western blotting (Figure 7D).

Of note, down-regulation of mTOR blocked Cd-induced
demethylated-PP2Ac, phospho-PP2Ac, down-regulated
PTEN, phospho-Akt, and phospho-Erk1/2 in the cells
even without pretreatment with rapamycin (Figure 7D).
Furthermore, as expected, down-regulation of mTOR
obviously prevented Cd-induced cleavage of caspase-3
and cell apoptosis, and potentiated the inhibitory effect
of rapamycin (Figure 7D–7F). Taken together, our
data underscore the concept that mTOR is a hub of the
PP2A/PTEN/Akt/Erk network involved in Cd-induced
neuronal cell death.

In this study, we found that rapamycin inhibits
Cd-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and cleavage of
caspase-3 in PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells and primary
neurons, as detected by Western blotting. This is
further supported by the results of phospho-Erk1/2
immunofluorescence staining and caspase3/7 activity
assay. To corroborate the above findings, pharmacological
Erk1/2 inhibitor PD98059 was utilized. We noticed that
the combination of rapamycin with PD98059 exhibited
a more potent inhibitory effect on Cd-induced activation
of Erk1/2 and caspase-3, as well as cell apoptosis than
rapamycin or PD98059 alone (Figure 3B and 3C).
Further, silencing Erk1/2 remarkably blocked Cd-induced
phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and cleavage of caspase-3
(Figure 3D). Concurrently, silencing Erk1/2 conferred
substantial resistance to Cd-induced neuronal apoptosis,
as evidenced by the reduced percentages of cells with
nuclear fragmentation and condensation in PC12 cells. Of
importance, addition of rapamycin reinforced the events,
in line with the data obtained from the co-treatment with
rapamycin/PD98059. Collectively, our findings indicate
that rapamycin prevents Cd-induced apoptosis, at least
in part, by blocking activation of Erk1/2 pathway in
neuronal cells.
Rapamycin has been documented to activate
PP2A [39]. It is known that PP2A negatively regulates
Erk1/2 pathway through dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 [35].
We have demonstrated that Cd activates Erk1/2, in part
via inhibition of PP2A, in neuronal cells [36]. This led us
to investigate the effect of rapamycin on PP2A activity
in neuronal apoptosis triggered by Cd. In this study, we
did not observe that rapamycin altered cellular protein
expression of the catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) (Figure 4A).
However, we found that Cd induced robust expression
of demethylated-PP2Ac and phospho-PP2Ac (Tyr307),
which was attenuated by rapamycin in PC12 cells, SHSY5Y cells and primary neurons (Figure 4A). These data
indicate that rapamycin activates the phosphatase activity
of PP2A at least by inhibiting Cd-elevated demethylation
and phosphorylation of PP2Ac, two events responsible
for PP2A inactivation [42]. Next, we tested the hypothesis
that rapamycin prevents Cd-induced Erk1/2 activation and
apoptosis via PP2A-dependent mechanism in neuronal
cells. For this, pharmacological/genetic inhibition
or rescue experiments for PP2A were carried out,
respectively. We found that over-expression of wild-type
PP2Ac potentiated rapamycin’s suppression of Cd-induced
phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and neuronal apoptosis,
whereas inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid, or expression
of dominant negative (dn)-PP2A resulted in the robust
phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and conferred high resistance
to rapamycin inhibition of Cd-induced cell apoptosis.
Furthermore, we also noticed that the cells expressing dnPP2A were able to remain sensitive to MEK1/2 inhibitor
PD98059. In contrast, over-expression of wild-type
PP2A markedly inhibited Cd-induced phosphorylation of

DISCUSSION
Cadmium, as one of the most toxic environmental
and industrial pollutants, is mainly released from smelting
and refining of metals, burning of chemical fuels and
municipal wastes, and cigarette smoking [1, 12]. Cd can
penetrate the blood-brain barrier and accumulate into the
brain contributing to the development of CNS damages
[7, 46]. Cd toxicity causes brain cellular dysfunction,
lethal cerebral edema and parkinsonism [9, 15]. Studies
have shown that cerebral cortical and hippocampal
neurons are targets of Cd toxicity, which is thought to play
an important role in human neurodegenerative diseases
[7–9, 12–15]. Therefore, it is of great importance to find
effective treatments against the damage of Cd on brain
neurons in individuals with Cd-induced neurodegenerative
diseases. Rapamycin is not only a lipophilic macrolide
antibiotic but also a specific mTOR inhibitor [30]. A series
of studies have recently shown that rapamycin is useful
in treatment of several human diseases, such as cancer,
diabetes, obesity, genetic disorders, and neurological
diseases [47, 48]. Especially, rapamycin has been reported
to be an effective treatment in several experimental
models of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, AD
and HD [26, 48–50], implying that rapamycin may act as
a pharmacological compound with therapeutic benefits for
fighting neurodegenerative diseases.
Our recent studies have shown that exposure of
Cd to mice or neuronal cells (PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y
cells or primary neurons) results in brain damage and
neuronal cell apoptosis in part through activation of
Akt/mTOR signaling pathway [12, 28]. By inhibiting
activation of Akt/mTOR pathway, rapamycin in vitro and
in vivo effectively attenuates Cd-triggered neuronal cell
death [12, 28]. We have also identified that Cd activates
Erk1/2 pathway contributing to neuronal cell death
[28, 36]. However, little is known about whether and how
rapamycin rescues cells from Cd-induced cell death by
inhibiting Erk1/2 pathway. Here we provide evidence that
rapamycin prevented Cd-induced apoptotic cell death by
inhibiting Erk1/2 pathway in neuronal cells. Further, we
found that rapamycin inhibited Cd activation of Erk1/2 via
preventing Cd-inactivation of PP2A and PTEN signaling
network.

Erk1/2 and cell apoptosis in the presence or absence
of rapamycin. These results support a model in which
rapamycin blocks Cd-induced neuronal apoptosis by
preventing Cd activation of Erk1/2, which is partially
attributed to inactivation of PP2A.
PTEN is well-known to negatively regulate Akt/
mTOR pathway [22, 29, 37]. Our recent studies have
noticed that Cd down-regulates PTEN protein expression,
leading to activation of Akt/mTOR signaling in PC12
cells [20]. In this study, pretreatment with rapamycin
(200 ng/ml) for 48 h potently prevented Cd from reducing
PTEN expression in PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells and
primary neurons (Figure 6A). Of note, emerging studies
have suggested that PTEN also negatively regulates
Erk1/2 pathway in several malignancies [38]. Additionally,
PI3K/Akt can activate Erk1/2 through PKC [38]. Putting
all data together, we postulated that a cross-talk may occur
between PTEN, Akt and Erk1/2 pathways in neuronal
cells in response to Cd, i.e. Cd down-regulation of PTEN
and concurrent activation of Akt may result in activation
of Erk1/2, which may be prevented by rapamycin. In
this study, for the first time, we presented evidence that
rapamycin inhibited Cd-induced neuronal apoptosis indeed
by preventing Cd down-regulation of PTEN and activation
of Akt, resulting in inhibition of Erk1/2 pathway.
This is strongly supported by the findings that ectopic
expression of wild-type PTEN or dominant negative
Akt, or inhibition of Akt with Akt inhibitor X enhanced
rapamycin’s inhibitory effect on Cd-induced phosphoErk1/2 and cell death in PC12 cells (Figure 6B–6G).
Our data underscore that rapamycin has an ability to
prevent Cd from inactivation of PTEN and activation of
Akt, thereby attenuating Cd-induced Erk1/2 activation and
neuronal apoptosis.
Rapamycin is a well-known mTOR inhibitor
[16, 17, 30]. However, studies have also shown that
rapamycin suppresses differentiation of C2C12 cells [45],
which is mTOR kinase activity-independent, although
this remains controversial [45, 51]. This prompted us
to study whether rapamycin prevents Cd inhibition of
PP2A, downregulation of PTEN and activation of Akt,
resulting in activation of Erk1/2 and cell apoptosis in
an mTOR kinase activity-dependent manner. We found
that rapamycin failed to block Cd inactivation of PP2A,
downregulation of PTEN, and activation of Akt, and
thus could not prevent Cd-induced Erk1/2 activation
and cell apoptosis in Ad-mTOR-T-infected cells, but
not in Ad-GFP-infected control cells, suggesting an
mTOR-dependent mechanism involved. This is further
supported by the findings that silencing mTOR resulted
in activation of PP2A, restoration of PTEN expression,
and inhibition of Akt, thereby inhibiting Erk1/2
activation and cell apoptosis. These results clearly
indicate that inhibition of mTOR, following rapamycin
treatment, can indirectly suppress Erk1/2 pathway,
attenuating Cd-induced neuronal apoptosis. It is worth
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mentioning that MEK/Erk1/2 can also indirectly activate
mTOR pathway in a cell type-specific manner [52]. For
instance, oncogenic MEK/Erk1/2 signaling stimulates
mTORC1 activity by promoting p90 ribosomal S6 kinase
(RSK)-mediated raptor phosphorylation [53]. Phorbol
ester (PMA), a tumor promoter, hyper-activates the MEK/
Erk1/2 pathway and increases phosphorylation of S6K/
S6 in SKBR3 breast cancer cells, which can be abrogated
by co-treatment with U0126 and rapamycin [54].
Taken together, there exists a complex cross-talk between
MEK/Erk1/2 and mTOR pathways. Further research may
unveil more mechanisms by which mTOR and Erk1/2
regulate each other.
How does rapamycin suppress Cd-induced
activation of mTOR involved in PP2A inactivation and
PTEN reduction? It has been reported that the activity of
PTEN could be almost completely abolished by hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), a well-known oxidant, in vitro and
in vivo [55]. Additionally, the activity of PP2A is inhibited
by H2O2 in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells [56] and in
PC12 cells and primary neurons [57] as well. The data
suggest that oxidative stress inactivates cellular PTEN
and PP2A. In line with the above findings, Cd-induced
reactive oxygen species (ROS) also down-regulates the
protein expression of PTEN and the activity of PP2A in
PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons [20, 36].
Of note, growing evidence has shown that rapamycin
has the ability to attenuate oxidative stress-induced cell
damage or death [12, 20, 58, 59]. For example, rapamycin
inhibits H2O2-induced loss of vascular contractility [59].
Diabetes-induced oxidative retinal injury is ameliorated
by rapamycin [58]. Recent studies from our group have
revealed that pretreatment with rapamycin in vitro for 48 h
prevents Cd-induced ROS from inactivation of PTEN
and activation of Akt/mTOR pathway, as well as neuronal
cell death [20]. Administration of rapamycin in vivo also
potently attenuates Cd-induced ROS activation of Akt/
mTOR contributing to brain damage and neuron death in
mice [12]. It has been observed that rapamycin suppresses
Cd-induced ROS, by down-regulating the expression of
ROS generating enzyme NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) and
its regulatory proteins (p22phox, p67phox, p40phox, p47phox, and
Rac1) in PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells [20], suggesting that
mTOR may positively regulate expression of these ROS
generating proteins, although the mechanism remains to
be defined. In the current study, we have demonstrated
that rapamycin can inhibit mTOR-dependent PP2A/PTEN/
Akt/Erk network contributing to Cd-induced neuronal cell
apoptosis. Thus, we tentatively deduce that rapamycin is
likely to act by the mechanism that counteracts Cd-induced
oxidative stress by down-regulating expression of NOX2
and its regulatory proteins, thereby not only preventing
Cd-induced activation of mTOR, but also blocking Cdinduced inactivation of PP2A and down-regulation of
PTEN. Rapamycin may be involved in modulating
interactions of diverse signals and expression of genes

associated with Cd-induced neurotoxicity. Undoubtedly,
more studies are needed to address these issues.
In summary, here we have identified that rapamycin
attenuates Cd-induced neuronal apoptosis by blocking
Erk1/2 pathway. Rapamycin blocks Cd-induced Erk1/2
activation contributing to apoptosis not only by preventing
Cd inhibition of PP2A, but also through hindering Cd
down-regulation of PTEN and activation of Akt in
neuronal cells in an mTOR kinase activity-dependent
manner (Figure 8). The results indicate that rapamycin
inhibits Cd activation of Erk1/2-mediated neuronal

dominant negative Akt (dn-Akt, T308A/S473A) was a
generous gift from Dr. Kenneth Walsh (Boston University,
Boston, MA). For experiments, PC12 cells were grown
in the growth medium and infected with the individual
adenovirus for 24 h at 5 of multiplicity of infection
(MOI = 5). Subsequently, cells were used for experiments.
Ad-GFP served as a control. Expression of HA-tagged
dn-PP2A and dn-Akt, as well as FLAG-tagged PP2A
and mTOR-T was determined by Western blot analysis
with antibodies to HA and FLAG, respectively. As S6K1
is a substrate of mTOR, the function of mTOR-T in the
cells was assessed by immunoblotting with antibodies to
phospho-S6K1 (Thr389).

PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons
were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in a
6-well plate containing a PDL-uncoated or -coated glass
coverslip per well. Next day, after exposed to Cd (10 and
20 μM) for 24 h following pre-incubation with/without
rapamycin (200 ng/ml) for 48 h, cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and incubated with 3% normal goat

for overnight at 40°C, and then incubating with secondary
antibody to FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG

were pretreated with/without rapamycin (200 ng/ml) for
48 h, and then with/without okadaic acid (100 nM) or
PD98059 (10 μM) for 1 h, followed by exposure to Cd
