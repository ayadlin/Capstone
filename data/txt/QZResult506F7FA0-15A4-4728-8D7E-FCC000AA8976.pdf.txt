Abstract

Author Manuscript

Successful treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is frequently hindered by
development of resistance to conventional chemotherapy resulting in disease relapse and high
mortality. High expression of anti-apoptotic and/or drug transporter proteins induced by oncogenic
signaling pathways has been implicated in the development of chemoresistance in cancer.
Previously, our studies showed high expression of ATP-binding cassette drug transporter ABCG2
in DLBCL correlated inversely with disease-free and failure-free survival. In this study, we have
implicated activated hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway as a key factor behind high ABCG2
expression in DLBCL through direct upregulation of ABCG2 gene transcription. We have
identified a single binding site for GLI transcription factors in the ABCG2 promoter and
established its functionality using luciferase reporter, site-directed mutagenesis and chromatinimmunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, in DLBCL tumor samples, significantly high ABCG2
and GLI1 levels were found in DLBCL tumors with lymph node involvement in comparison to
DLBCL tumor cells collected from pleural and/or peritoneal effusions. This suggests a role for the
stromal microenvironment in maintaining high levels of ABCG2 and GLI1. Accordingly, in vitro
co-culture of DLBCL cells with HS-5 stromal cells increased ABCG2 mRNA and protein levels
by paracrine activation of Hh signaling. In addition to ABCG2, co-culture of DLBCL cells with
HS-5 cells also resulted in increase expression of the antiapoptotic proteins BCL2, BCL-xL and
BCL2A1 and in induced chemotolerance to doxorubicin and methotrexate, drugs routinely used
for the treatment of DLBCL. Similarly, activation of Hh signaling in DLBCL cell lines with
recombinant Shh N-terminal peptide resulted in increased expression of BCL2 and ABCG2
associated with increased chemotolerance. Finally, functional inhibition of ABCG2 drug efflux

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of B-cell non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (30-40%) (Alexander et al., 2007). Although DLBCL is potentially curable with
conventional anthracycline-based therapy, variability in response is often observed.
Approximately, 50% patients relapse and ultimately die of their disease (Fisher et al., 1993).
The cellular mechanisms responsible for drug resistance in DLBCL are poorly understood
and their elucidation could improve current therapeutic approaches.

Author Manuscript

The development of multidrug resistance (MDR), a situation in which cancer cells become
resistant to a variety of structurally and mechanistically unrelated drugs, remains a major
challenge in the treatment of cancer (Gottesman, 2002). One mechanism of MDR is the
increased expression of adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) drug transporters
that mediate energy-dependent transport of drugs out of the cells against a concentration
gradient, resulting in low intracellular drug concentrations (Gottesman et al., 2002). Drugs
affected by classical MDR include the vinca alkaloids (vincristine and vinblastine),
anthracyclines (doxorubicin and daunorubicin) the RNA transcription inhibitor actinomycinD and the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel (Ambudkar et al., 1999).

Author Manuscript

The ABC transporter proteins are a large superfamily of transmembrane glycoproteins, with
48 members divided in 7 different families based on their sequence homology and domain
organization (Dean and Allikmets, 2001). One of the major MDR pumps is ABCG2,
originally named Breast Cancer Resistant Protein (BCRP), first discovered in doxorubicinresistant breast cancer cells (Doyle et al., 1998) and also called ABCP (Allikmets et al.,
1998) or MXR1 (Miyake et al., 1999). ABCG2 encodes a half-molecule ABC transporter of
72 kDa protein which predominantly localizes to the plasma membrane (Rocchi et al., 2000)
and forms homodimers to become functional (Kage et al., 2002). ABCG2 transports a wide
variety of positively and negatively charged hydrophobic substrates, including natural
compounds like flavonoids, porphyrins, sulfated estrogens along with several drugs like
mitoxantrone, methotrexate, topotecan, SN38, flavopiridol, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and
doxorubicin (Krishnamurthy and Schuetz, 2006; Sarkadi et al., 2004).
Elevated expression of ABCG2 has been reported in several epithelial and hematological
cancers (Bleau et al., 2009; Candeil et al., 2004; Diestra et al., 2002; Kawabata et al., 2003;
Tsunoda et al., 2006; Yoh et al., 2004). In hematological cancers, the expression and clinical
significance of ABCG2 have been frequently investigated in acute leukemias and have
produced controversial results, in part due to the overlapping role of the ABC transporters
(Abbott et al., 2002; Andreadis et al., 2007; Benderra et al., 2004; Damiani et al., 2010;

Sauerbrey et al., 2002; Stam et al., 2004; Steinbach et al., 2002; Uggla et al., 2005; Yuen
and Sikic, 1994). Studies of ABC transporter expression in lymphomas are more limited and
have focused more in MDR1 than in ABCG2. One study identified two polymorphisms in
ABCG2 gene, G34A (Val12Met) and C421A (Gln141Lys), and associated these
polymorphisms with increased risk and poor overall survival of DLBCL (Hu et al., 2007).
We previously reported that DLBCL patients with high ABCG2 protein expression showed
significantly shorter overall survival and failure free-survival compared with patients with
tumors with low or no expression of ABCG2 (Kim et al., 2009). However, Andreadis and
colleagues (Andreadis et al., 2007) found no association between ABCG2 mRNA levels
with outcome in a series of 130 DLBCL patients.

There is little data available regarding the molecular mechanisms controlling ABCG2
expression. Recent studies suggest ABCG2 expression may be controlled at the
transcriptional level by sex hormones and hypoxia (Krishnamurthy et al., 2004; Yasuda et
al., 2009). It has also been shown that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling activation upregulates the
expression of ABCG2 and MDR1 in several epithelial cancers (Sims-Mourtada et al., 2007;
Sims-Mourtada et al., 2006). However, whether this phenomenon occurs through direct
transcriptional regulation of transporter genes by GLI1, the transcriptional activator of the
Hh pathway (Eichberger et al., 2006), remains to be determined.

Author Manuscript

Hh signaling is known as a major oncogenic pathway and therefore is a potential target for
therapy in several cancers (Taipale and Beachy, 2001). This pathway is composed of 3
ligands (Sonic Hh, Indian Hh and Dessert Hh), 2 receptors, a 12 transmembrane protein,
PTC (ligand binding subunit), and a 7 transmembrane protein, smoothened (SMO) (signal
transducing component) and 3 five-zinc finger transcription factors, GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3
(Murone et al., 1999). Binding of Hh ligands to PTC releases PTC-mediated inhibition of
SMO allowing SMO to activate the pathway. While both GLI2 and GLI3, have
transcriptional activation and repression properties, GLI1 is a strong positive regulator of Hh
transcriptional targets and is, itself, a transcriptional target of Hh signaling (Eichberger et
al., 2006).
Recently, we provided evidence that Hh signaling is activated and involved in the biology of
DLBCL (Singh et al., 2010). Here, we investigated if ABCG2 is a direct downstream target
of Hh signaling and the role of stromal microenvironment in modulating the expression
levels of ABCG2 in DLBCL. We have also investigated if inhibition of ABCG2 transporter
activity or inhibition of Hh signaling improves chemotherapy responses in DLBCL cells.

Results
Inhibition of Hh signaling decreased ABCG2 mRNA and protein levels in DLBCL cell lines
We first studied the effect of Hh signaling inhibition on the expression of ABCG2 in 4
DLBCL cell lines. Treating DLBCL cell lines with the SMO inhibitor cyclopamine-KAAD
for 24h resulted in marked decrease of ABCG2 mRNA levels in comparison with
tomatidine, alkaloid similar to cyclopamine but lacking the capacity to inhibit SMO.
Concomitant decrease of GLI1 mRNA levels confirmed inhibition of the Hh signaling

pathway (Figure 1a). Similarly, cyclopamine-KAAD also decreased ABCG2 protein levels
in DLBCL cell lines (Figure 1b).
ABCG2 gene expresion is transcriptionally modulated by Hh signaling

Author Manuscript

To uncover if ABCG2 is a transcriptional target of Hh signaling, studies involving
modulation (activation or inhibition) of Hh signaling and the effects on ABCG2 levels were
conducted in 293T cells. 293T cells have functional Hh signaling (supplementary Figure 1)
and have been previously used for mechanistic studies (Barnes et al., 2005; Bhatia et al.,
2006). Activation of Hh signaling with a recombinant Shh N-terminal peptide resulted in
increased expression of ABCG2 whereas inhibition of Hh signaling using SANT
(Smoothened ANTagonist) or cyclopamine-KAAD resulted in decrease of ABCG2 mRNA
levels (Figure 1c). Silencing of GLI1 resulted in decrease of ABCG2 expression associated
with decrease levels of GLI1 and cyclin D2 (CCND2), a known target of Hh signaling
(Figure 1d). Furthermore, the dose-dependent increase in ABCG2 protein levels on
treatment with recombinant Shh N-terminal peptide could be abrogated by concomitant
treatment with actinomycin D (transcriptional inhibitor) but not with cyclohexamide
(translational inhibitor) supporting that the increase of ABCG2 are mainly due to the
increase of its transcriptional activity but not due to increased translational activity or
posttranslational modifications (Figure 1e).
Hh signaling-mediated regulation of ABCG2 is via a functional GLI-binding site in its
promoter

Author Manuscript

The organization of human ABCG2 gene and its promoter sequence has been previously
characterized (Bailey-Dell et al., 2001). Using the program MATINSPECTOR professional
version 7.2 (Quandt et al., 1995) we identified a potential GLI binding site on the ABCG2
promoter, 408 base-pair upstream of the transcription start site (Figure 2a). To validate its
functionality, we performed luciferase assays in 293T cells transfected with several ABCG2
promoter luciferase constructs; three with the potential GLI binding site and one without the
binding site (depicted schematically in Figure 2a). Treatment with recombinant Shh-Nterminal peptide resulted in increase of luciferase activity in those cells transfected with the
constructs that included the potential GLI-binding site, whereas no increase of luciferase
activity was observed in those cells transfected with the construct that lacked the GLIbinding site (Figure 2a, top panels). Cyclopamine-KAAD or siRNA-mediated silencing of
GLI1 expression resulted in a decrease of the luciferase activity in those cells transfected
with the constructs with the potential GLI-binding site but not in those transfected with the
construct without the GLI-binding site (Figure 2a, middle and lower panels).

Mutation of GLI-binding site nullifies responsiveness of ABCG2 gene promoter to Hh
signaling
To further confirm the functionality of this binding site, a luciferase construct with the full
length ABCG2 promoter but with two cytosines (at positions 410 and 411) in the GLIbinding motif mutated to guanines was generated by site directed mutagenesis. Mutation of
these cytosines at these positions results in loss of binding affinity of GLI to DNA
(Winklmayr et al., 2010). Luciferase assay in 293T cells transfected with the ABCG2

construct with the mutated GLI-binding site showed a decrease of baseline luciferase
activity when compared to the non-mutated construct indicating a decrease of activity by the
mutated promoter (Figure 2b, left panel). Furthermore, in comparison to the non-mutated
ABCG2 promoter, the mutated construct lost the ability to respond to modulations of the
activation status of Hh signaling (Figure 2b, middle and lower panels).
GLI1 directly binds to the promoter of ABCG2

Author Manuscript

Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies (ChIP) were performed to confirm the direct
binding of GLI to the promoter region of ABCG2. In 293T cells, ChIP studies using a GLI1specific antibody resulted in the precipitation of ABCG2 promoter region encompassing the
GLI-binding site (Figure 3, top left panel). ChIP analyses performed with GLI1 antibody in
three different DLBCL cell lines also demonstrated the direct binding of GLI1 with the
ABCG2 promoter (Figure 3, top right panel). ChIP experiments were also performed with
chromatin isolated from 293T cells at different time intervals after Hh stimulation. As
shown in Figure 3, enhanced GLI1 binding to the ABCG2 promoter was detected at 90 min
after activation of Hh signaling (Figure 3, lower panel). Accordingly, ChIP studies using an
antibody specific for acetylatedâ€“Histone3 (Lysine18) showed an increase of acetylation
detected 90 min after treatment with recombinant Shh N-terminal peptide (Figure 3, lower
panel) supporting enhanced transcriptional activity at this time, coinciding with a high
association of GLI1.
Co-culturing DLBCL cell lines with HS-5 cells enhances expression of ABCG2

Author Manuscript

We studied the expression of ABCG2 by real-time q-PCR analysis in DLBCL tumor samples
collected from 15 patients; 7 samples were collected from DLBCL involving lymph node
and 8 samples were aphaeresis samples collected from pleural and/or peritoneal effusions
and thus lacking of a stromal component. Higher expression levels of ABCG2 and GLI1
were found in samples of DLBCL involving lymph nodes than in pleural or peritoneal
effusion samples (p=0.0289 and p=0.0145, respectively) (Figure 4a). These findings suggest
the possibility of a stimulatory effect by the stromal microenvironment on GLI1 and ABCG2
levels in the tumor cells. To investigate this possibility, we co-cultured DLBCL cell lines
with the human bone-marrow stroma cell line, HS-5. Direct contact was not allowed
between DLBCL cells and the stroma cells as a nylon membrane separated both cell
compartments (trans-well experiments). Co-culturing DLBCL cells (DOHH2, BJAB and
OCI-LY10) with HS-5 cells for 5-7 days consistently resulted in increase in ABCG2 mRNA
and protein levels in comparison to DLBCL cells alone (Figure 4b, upper and lower panels).
Immunofluorescence studies also confirmed the up-regulation of ABCG2 after co-culturing
DLBCL cells with stromal cells (Figure 4c).

DLBCL cell lines and tumors express wild-type ABCG2 (R482) but not the R482G mutant
A point mutation of adenine (A) to guanine (G) at 1443 position of ABCG2 coding sequence
results in replacement of an arginine residue at position 482 with glycine or threonine
(R482G/T), changing the substrate specificity of ABCG2. Both wild-type (WT) and mutant
forms have several common drugs substrates like mitoxantrone, topotecan, tyrosine-kinase
inhibitors and Hoechst dye. However, the WT ABCG2 is known to transport methotrexate,

whereas the mutant form transports doxorubicin, daunorubicin and epirubicin (Sarkadi et al.,
2004). By sequence analysis, ABCG2 was WT (R482) in 9 DLBCL cell lines and 9 tumor
samples (data not shown).
Inhibition of ABCG2 drug efflux activity partially abrogates chemotolerance induced by coculturing DLBCL cells with HS-5 cells

Author Manuscript

We investigated if the increase of ABCG2 expression induced by stromal cells contributes to
chemoresistance of DLBCL cell lines. Treatments with 0.05 and 0.1Î¼g/mL doxorubicin
resulted in decreased viability in 16% and 21% for BJAB cells and in 20% and 22% for
DOHH2 cells, respectively. Similarly, treatments with 0.05 and 0.1Î¼g/mL methotrexate
resulted in decreased viability in 30% and 40% for BJAB cells and in 40% and 45% for
DOHH2 cells, respectively. Co-culturing both cell lines with HS-5 cells increased
chemotolerance to doxorubicin and methotrexate. (Figure 4d). However, inhibition of
ABCG2 activity with fumitremorgin C (FTC), an ABCG2 inhibitor (Rabindran et al., 2000),
significantly decreased the chemotolerance of DLBCL cells to methotrexate in the presence
of stromal cells (Figure 4d). Decreased chemotolerance induced by FTC in the presence of
stroma was not observed with doxorubicin, as doxorubicin is not a substrate for WT
ABCG2. Moreover, FTC alone did not induce changes on cell viability of DLBCL cells in
the absence of methotrexate or doxorubicin. These findings support that the decrease of
chemotolerance induced by FTC does not represent an unspecific effect of FTC. The drugs
used in these experiments did not affect cell viability of HS-5 cells (supplementary Figures
2a and b).
Inhibition of Hh signaling by cyclopamine-KAAD abrogates chemotolerance induced by
co-culturing DLBCL cells with HS-5 cells

Author Manuscript

HS-5 cells secrete Hh ligands and are capable of activating Hh signaling (Dierks et al.,
2007; Hegde et al., 2008; Singh et al., 2010). So, we investigated if the activation of Hh
signaling induced by stromal cells contributes towards upregulation of ABCG2 and
chemotolerance of DLBCL cell lines. DLBCL cell lines were co-cultured with HS-5 cells in
the presence and absence of cyclopamine-KAAD (2Î¼M) for 48h. Co-culturing DLBCL cells
with stroma resulted in activation of Hh signaling in DLBCL cells as indicated by the
increase of GLI1, BCL2 and ABCG2 mRNA levels. Cyclopamine-KAAD blocked Hh
signaling activation induced by HS-5 cells (Figure 5a), as indicated by the decrease of GLI1,
BCL2, and ABCG2 mRNA levels.

Author Manuscript

Treatments with 0.25 and 0.5Î¼g/mL doxorubicin resulted in decrease of cell viability by
37% to 50% for BJAB and 42.0% to 60.5% for DOHH2 cells. Similarly, treatments with
0.05 and 0.1Î¼g/mL methotrexate decreased cell viability by 30% to 40% for BJAB and 35%
to 45% for DOHH2 (Figure 5b). Co-culturing cell lines with HS-5 cells increased
chemotolerance to both drugs and inhibition of Hh activity by cyclopamine-KAAD
significantly decreased the chemotolerance of DLBCL cells in the presence of stromal cells
(Figure 5b). Treatment with cyclopamine-KAAD (2Î¼M) did not affect cell viability of HS-5
cells (supplementary Figure 2c).

Stimulation of Hh signaling with Shh N-terminal peptide also enhances chemotolerance in
DLBCL cell lines in the absence of stromal cells
Treatment with recombinant Shh ligand (250 ng/mL) activates Hh signaling in BJAB and
DOHH2 cells as evidenced by the increase of mRNA levels of GLI1, ABCG2 and BCL-2
within 24h (Figure 6a) and induces chemotolerance to doxorubicin and methotrexate. These
findings support that activation of Hh signaling is one of the factors that contribute to the
chemotolerance induced by stroma. The fact that the increase of chemotolerance was seen
for both drugs, suggests that in addition to ABCG2 other Hh signaling downstream targets
are involved (supplementary Figure 3c). In fact, we found that the chemotolerance induced
by HS-5 cells in DLBCL cells could also be partially reversed by functional inhibition of
BCL2 using the BH3-mimetic YC-137 (supplementary Figure 4).

DISCUSSION
The regulation of ABC transporters in the context of cancer is poorly understood. SimsMourtada and colleagues found that Hh signaling was responsible in maintaining high
expression levels of MDR1 and ABCG2 in esophageal cancer cell lines and that inhibition
of Hh signaling increases the response of these cell lines to multiple structurally unrelated
drugs (Sims-Mourtada et al., 2007). However, this study did not provide any proof whether
the modulation of expression of these ABC transporters by Hh signaling was due to a direct
transcriptional regulation by GLI1 or indirectly by modulating levels of other transcriptional
regulators.

Author Manuscript

Here, we demonstrated the presence of a GLI1 transcription factor-binding site in the
ABCG2 promoter and established ABCG2 as a direct downstream target of Hh signaling.
Direct physical interaction of GLI1 to the ABCG2 promoter chromatin was evident in ChIP
assays done in 293T and DLBCL cell lines. We also show that the binding of GLI1 to the
ABCG2 promoter was enhanced in the presence of recombinant Shh ligand and resulted in
increased histone acetylation, a hallmark for formation of euchromatin and enhanced gene
transcription.
We also found that the expression levels of ABCG2 and GLI1 are higher in DLBCL samples
collected from lymph node specimens (which included nodal stromal cells) when compared
with DLBCL involving pleural or peritoneal effusions (without stromal component). Our
previous immunohistochemical studies performed in lymph node specimens showed that
ABCG2 and GLI1 were highly expressed by DLBCL cells in tissue samples (Kim et al.,
2009).

Author Manuscript

Interactions between tumor cells and the stromal microenvironment are increasingly
implicated as critical components for MDR (Fidler, 2003; Grigorieva et al., 1998; Mueller
and Fusenig, 2004). To test if the microenvironment contributes to the activation of Hh
signaling we co-cultured DLBCL cells with HS-5 cells and analyzed expression of ABCG2
and GLI1. HS-5 cells are an integral in the bone marrow and lymph node microenvironment
and have been used previously to study the effect of microenvironment on tumor cells and
vice versa (Baumann et al., 2009; Fernandez et al., 2010; Lwin et al., 2009; McMillin et al.,
2010). HS-5 cells are also known to synthesize and secrete Hh ligands and hence are capable

of the paracrine activation of the Hh signaling (Desch et al., 2010; Dierks et al., 2007; Singh
et al., 2010). We found that co-culturing DLBCL cells with stromal cells increased the
expression of GLI1, ABCG2 and BCL2 in the tumor cells and that this activation of Hh
signaling is blocked with a SMO inhibitor.

Author Manuscript

The mode of action of Hh signaling in cancer appears rather complex and may be tumor
dependent. Several studies suggest an autocrine action in some tumors and others favor a
paracrine model. It has been shown that Hh signaling has a paracrine role as a survival factor
for low-grade B-cell neoplasms, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and plasma
cell myeloma (Dierks et al., 2007; Hegde et al., 2008). Sacedon and colleagues (Sacedon et
al., 2005) have also found that Hh ligands are produced by follicular dendritic cells inside
the germinal centers and that inhibition of Hh signaling induces apoptosis in germinal center
B-cells, which are rescued by addition of Hh ligand, supporting a paracrine role of Hh
signaling in the germinal center compartment. In DLBCL, our study supports that, in the
presence of stroma, Hh signaling works in a paracrine manner. However, we also recently
showed that in the absence of stroma, DLBCL cells, synthesize, secrete, and respond to
endogenous Hh ligands, also providing support of an autocrine signaling loop (Singh et al.,
2010).

Author Manuscript

Hh signaling has been identified as an essential component in MDR in acute myeloid
leukemia. Hh signaling induces resistance to radiotherapy and a MDR phenotype in
esophageal adenocarcinomas (Queiroz et al., 2010; Sims-Mourtada et al., 2007). Targeting
Hh signaling to decrease chemotolerance is of interest because this pathway affects different
mechanisms involved in chemoresistance, including expression levels of antiapoptotic
molecules such as BCL2, and BCL-xL as well as ATP binding cassettes such as ABCG2
and MDR1. Interfering with pathways like Hh signaling that block multiple molecules
involved in chemotolerance could lead to potential more effective therapeutic strategies to
enhance the effect of current chemotherapeutic agents. Our data show that the stroma is
important inducing chemotolerance in DLBCL and that this effect is, in part, mediated by
activation of Hh signaling and by inducing high expression of downstream targets such as
ABCG2 and BCL2 (Bigelow et al., 2004).

Author Manuscript

Inhibiting ABCG2 in DLBCL could be also therapeutically relevant because methotrexate, a
substrate of WT ABCG2, is also used to treat primary DLBCL of the central nervous system
(CNS) and as prophylaxis for CNS involvement in systemic DLBCL. Methotrexate is also
currently used in protocols for aggressive cases of systemic DLBCL (i.e. ACVBP followed
by consolidation protocols that include high-doses of methotrexate and CODOX-M that
includes cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and methotrexate). Methotrexate is
also part of some protocols for relapsed or refractory DLBCL and is included in some
protocols for conventional DLBCL (i.e. RMACOP-B)(Armitage, 2007). In addition,
mutations in the ABCG2 gene acquired during the course of chemotherapy can change
substrate specificity. It has been shown that mutation of amino-acid 482 in the ABCG2 gene
confers resistance to doxorubicin and daunorubicin (Honjo et al., 2001; Robey et al., 2003).
Moreover, it has been also shown that cell lines selected with doxorubicin frequently show
enrichment of cells with the R482G/T ABCG2 mutant form (Robey et al., 2003). A similar
scenario is also plausible in DLBCL patients, where initial treatment with doxorubicin may

result in selection of cells with a mutant ABCG2 gene carrying the R482G/T mutation that
could contribute to chemotolerance.
In summary, we have established ABCG2 as a direct downstream target of Hh signaling
pathway. We have also demonstrated the role of stromal microenvironment in inducing
chemotolerance in DLBCL cells and that paracrine activation of Hh signaling in lymphoma
cells play a role in inducing chemotolerance in DLBCL. Inhibition of Hh signaling reverses
stroma-induced chemotolerance suggesting that targeting Hh signaling may be of
therapeutic value to decrease chemotolerance in DLBCL. Also, inhibiting ABCG2 results in
a partial reversal of stroma-induced chemotolerance highlighting the possibility of ABCG2
being involved in chemoresistance mechanisms in DLBCL and possibly in a wide variety of
other cancers with abnormal activation of Hh signaling.

Nine DLBCL cell lines were used; 4 germinal center type (BJAB, DOHH2, Pfeiffer and
SUDHL4), 4 activated cell type (HBL1, OCI-LY3, OCI-LY10 and SUDHL2) and 1 primary
mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) cell line (U2940). DOHH2, SUDHL4, and U2940

ABCG2 expression was studied in samples collected from 15 patients with DLBCL; 7
samples were collected from DLBCL involving lymph nodes and 8 samples were collected
from pleural and/or peritoneal effusions.
Real-Time quantitative (q) PCR and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA,
USA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA synthesis was done using random primers
and SuperScript IIâ„¢ Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The Taqman
minor groove binder probe and the ABI PrismÂ® 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (PE
Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used. The primers and probes for GLI1,
GLI2, GLI3, PTC, SMO, ABCG2, CCND2, BCL2, BCL-xL, BCL2A1, GUSB and 18s rRNA
were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Each target was amplified individually and in
duplicate. These experiments were done at least in duplicate. The relative levels of mRNA
were calculated using delta CT (Î”CT) method. For comparison of the levels of ABCG2 in
samples the 2-(Î”Î”CT) method (Schmittgen, 2001) was used using expression of ABCG2 in
Human Reference total RNA (Stratagene, Santaclara, CA, USA) as control.

Western blot analysis

Author Manuscript

Western blotting was done as described previously (Singh et al., 2009). Antibodies used
were ABCG2 (H-70) and GLI1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Î²actin (Sigma). Reactions were visualized with suitable secondary antibodies conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham
Piscataway, NJ, USA). Actinomycin D and cyclohexamide were purchased from Sigma.
Immunofluorescence labeling and fluorescence microscopy
Immunofluorescence labeling was performed on cytospin preparations of DLBCL cell lines
as previously described (Singh et al., 2009). Staining for ABCG2 was done using a mousemonoclonal anti-ABCG2 antibody (Clone BXP-21) (Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle,
WA, USA).

Total RNA was extracted from cell lines and patients samples using RNeasy mini RNA
extraction kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was done using random primers and SuperScript
IIâ„¢ Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers used were 5â€²CTTCCTGACGACCAACCAGT-3â€² and 5â€²-CATCTGCCTTTGGCTTCAAT-3â€². PCR
product (221bp) was purified using PCR purification kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced.
Transfection of GLI1-specific siRNA

Author Manuscript

sMARTpool mix of four GLI1-specific siRNA and a control non-specific scrambled siRNA
were purchased from Dharmacon Inc (Lafayette, CO, USA). Transfection of siRNA in 293T
cells was done using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's instructions. Cells
were harvested 48h post siRNA transfection. Adequate inhibition of protein expression and
mRNA levels was confirmed by western blot and q-PCR.
Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay
Luciferase reporter plasmids with luciferase gene under transcriptional control of ABCG2
gene regulatory chromatin were kindly provided by Dr. Susan E Bates (National Cancer
Institute) (To et al., 2006). 293T cells were transfected with the luciferase plasmids using
Fugene HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Sciences, Florence, SC, USA). Renilla
luciferase plasmid was also co-transfected to normalize the luciferase activity. Luciferase
activity was measured 48h post-transfection using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA).

Co-culture, drug treatment and cell viability assays

Author Manuscript

HS-5 bone marrow cells were plated in 24- or 6-well plates as required and allowed to attach
and grow for 48h. For co-culture, cell culture inserts (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA, USA) with
0.4Î¼M membrane size were inserted into the wells and DLBCL cells were plated in the
inserts. Drug treatments were done using doxorubicin and methotrexate hydrate (Sigma),
fumitremorgin C (Enzo Lifesciences, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) cyclopamine-KAAD
(Toronto Research Chemicals Inc, North York, ON, Canada) and YC-137 (EMD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) at required concentrations in the media inside the wells
as well as the media in the insert to prevent any discrepancies due to dilution. Recombinant
Shh N-terminal peptide was purchased from R&D Biosystems, MN, USA). Cell viability
assay was done using Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution (MTS) (Promega).
Immunohistochemistry
Expression of ABCG2 in tumor samples was assessed using tissue microarrays and a
monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz (clone BXP-21) as previously described.

Statistical analysis
To evaluate the significance of ABCG2 expression in tumors with tissue involvement and
tumor cells from cavity effusions the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. To
calculate the statistical significance of the changes in the response of DLBCL cell lines to
drugs the paired t-test was used. Both tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version
5.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software (San Diego CA, USA).

Modulation of ABCG2 expression by Hh signaling. (a) Inhibition of Hh signaling by treating
DLBCL cell lines with cyclopamine-KAAD (5Î¼M for 24h) resulted in decreased ABCG2
mRNA levels in comparison to tomatidine controls (lower panels). The decrease of ABCG2
levels was associated with decrease of GLI1 mRNA levels confirming the suppression of Hh
signaling (upper panels). (b) Treatment with cyclopamine-KAAD (5Î¼M for 48h) also
decreased ABCG2 protein levels in DLBCL cell lines. (c) Treatment of 293T cells with
recombinant Shh N-terminal peptide increased ABCG2 mRNA and protein expression (in a

concentration dependent manner), whereas blocking of Hh signaling by the SMO inhibitors,
SANT and cyclopamine-KAAD (5Î¼M for 24h), resulted in suppression of ABCG2 mRNA
levels. (d) Silencing of GLI1 expression by siRNA in 293T cells decreased ABCG2 mRNA
levels. Effective silencing of GLI1 was evident by decrease of GLI1 and CCND2 mRNA
levels, direct downstream targets of GLI1. Silencing of GLI1 expression also resulted in
decreased ABCG2 protein levels in 293T cells. (e) The dose-dependent increase in the levels
of ABCG2 protein induced by Shh ligand was abolished by the transcriptional inhibitor
actinomycin D but not by the translational inhibitor cyclohexamide.

The ABCG2 promoter has a functional GLI-binding site. (a) A potential GLI-binding site
was identified in the ABCG2 promoter by in silico analysis. The 9 base pairs sequence of
the GLI-binding site is shown along with the consensus GLI-binding sequence below for
comparison. A schematic diagram of the luciferase constructs with the luciferase gene under
control of varying lengths of ABCG2 promoter (three constructs with the GLI-binding site,
represented by an asterisk, and one without it) is shown in the upper right side. Activation of
Hh signaling with recombinant Shh N-terminal peptide in 293T cells transfected with the

ABCG2 constructs carrying the potential GLI-binding site stimulated the luciferase activity
but not in the cells transfected with the construct without the GLI-binding site (-295).
Similarly, inhibiting Hh signaling either by cyclopamine-KAAD (C) or by silencing of GLI1
inhibited the luciferase activity of constructs with the GLI-binding site but not in the one
without the GLI binding site (-295). T, tomatidine (control for cyclopamine treatment). (b)
Luciferase assays in 293T cells transfected with the mutated ABCG2 construct showed a
decreased baseline luciferase activity when compared to the WT construct (left panel). In the
presence of a WT construct, treatments with 250ng/mL and 500ng/mL of recombinant Shh
N-terminal ligand increased luciferase activity by 2- and 8-fold, respectively, but resulted in
no effect (with 250ng/mL of Shh ligand), or in minimal increases (less than 2â€“fold; with
500ng/mL of Shh ligand) of luciferase activity in the presence of the mutated ABCG2
luciferase construct (middle panel). Similarly, treatment with cyclopamine-KAAD (C) in
comparison with tomatidine (T) resulted in decrease of luciferase activity in the presence of
the WT construct but not in the presence of the mutated one (right panel). The two cytosines
mutated to guanines in the GLI-binding motif are underlined.

ABCG2 is a direct downstream target of Hh signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assay with GLI1-specific antibody resulted in the precipitation of ABCG2 promoter
chromatin containing the GLI-binding site in 293T cells (left upper panel) and DLBCL cell
lines (right upper panel). ChIP experiments were also performed with chromatin isolated
from 293T cells at different time intervals after Hh stimulation (using recombinant Shh Nterminal peptide) to see if activation of Hh signaling results in increased association of GLI1
to the ABCG2 promoter. Enhanced GLI1 binding to the ABCG2 promoter was detected at 90
min after activation of Hh signaling (lower panel). Accordingly, ChIP studies using an
antibody specific for acetylatedâ€“Histone3 (Lysine18) showed an increase of histone
acetylation detected 90 min after treatment with recombinant Shh ligand in the ABCG2
promoter region supporting enhanced transcriptional activity at this time, coinciding with a
higher association of GLI1 to the ABCG2 promoter.

Co-culture of DLBCL cells with stromal cells increases ABCG2 expression and induces
chemotolerance. (a) Higher levels of ABCG2 mRNA were detected in samples collected
from DLBCL involving lymph node (LN) than in samples of DLBCL from cavity effusions.
(b) Several-fold increase of ABCG2 mRNA and protein levels was observed in DLBCL cell
lines co-cultured with HS-5 cells for 7 days when compared with DLBCL cells alone. The
real time q-PCR data is the average of two separate experiments. Similar increase in the
protein levels of ABCG2 was obtained after 5 days of co-culture (data not shown). (c)

Immunofluorescence staining also showed increase of ABCG2 protein levels in the
cytoplasm and membrane of four DLBCL cell lines after 7 days of co-culture with HS-5
cells. (d) Co-culturing BJAB and DOHH2 with HS-5 cells increased chemotolerance to
doxorubicin and methotrexate. However, inhibition of ABCG2 activity by fumitremorgin C
(FTC) significantly decreased the chemotolerance of DLBCL cells to methotrexate in the
presence of stromal cells, but not the tolerance to doxorubicin. *(p < 0.05); ** (p < 0.01);

Co-culture of DLBCL cells with HS-5 cells activates Hh signaling in DLBCL cells, which
contributes to chemoresistance. (a) Co-culture of DLBCL cell lines with HS-5 increased the
mRNA levels of GLI1 indicating activation of Hh signaling that was associated with
increased expression of BCL2 and ABCG2. Concomitant treatment with cyclopamineKAAD (2Î¼M) decreased the expression of GLI1 (evidence of inhibition of Hh signaling)
that was associated with decreased expression of BCL2 and ABCG2 mRNA levels. (b) In the
presence of HS-5 cells, BJAB and DOHH2 cells were more tolerant to increasing

concentrations of doxorubicin and methotrexate than cells alone. This acquired
chemotolerance for both drugs could be abrogated by inhibiting Hh signaling using sublethal
doses (2Î¼M) of cyclopamine-KAAD. Note that treatment with cyclopamine-KAAD (2uM)
alone did not affect cell viability of BJAB and DOHH2 cells in the presence of stroma. *(p <

Treatment with Shh N-terminal peptide induces chemotolerance in DLBCL cells. (a)
Treatment with Shh N-terminal peptide (250ng/mL) for 24h significantly increases mRNA
levels of GLI1, BCL2 and ABCG2 in BJAB and DOHH2 cell lines indicating activation of
Hh signaling. (b) Treatment with Shh N-terminal peptide increases chemotolerance of BJAB
and DOHH2 cell lines to both doxorubicin and methotrexate (in particular to low-doses of
these agents) in comparison with doxorubicin and methotrexate alone. *(p < 0.05).
