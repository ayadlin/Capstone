Abstract
The HER2/neu oncogene is an important diagnostic and
prognostic factor and therapeutic target in breast and other
cancers. We developed and characterized a breast cancer cell
line (Bam1a) that overexpresses the activated HER2/neu and
ErbB-3 and has a gene expression profile consistent with the
ErbB-2 genetic signature. We evaluated the effects of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/HER2 inhibitor,
gefitinib, on this breast tumor line in vitro and in vivo. We
characterized the effects of gefitinib on EGFR, HER2, and
ErbB-3 phosphorylation by Western blot and determined the
effects on downstream signaling through growth, survival,
and stress pathways and the effect on proliferation, cell cycle,
and apoptosis. Gefitinib treatment diminished phosphorylation of the ErbB-3 > EGFR > HER2/neu and signal transducers
and activators of transcriptions in a dose-dependent fashion.
Downstream mitogenic signaling through mitogen-activated
protein (MAP)/extracellular signal regulated kinase kinase,
p44/42 MAP kinase (MAPK) and stress signaling through
c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) 1 and c-Jun was impaired (1 Mmol/L,
4–24 h), leading to cytostasis and cell cycle arrest within
24 h by decreased cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and pSer795Rb and
increased p27. Proliferation and colony formation were inhibited at 0.5 and 1 Mmol/L, respectively, and correlated with
altered gene expression profiles. Diminished survival signaling through Akt, induction of bim, loss of connexin43, and
decreased production of vascular endothelial growth factor-D
preceded caspase-3 and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP)
cleavage and apoptosis (>50% 2 Mmol/L, 48 h). Oral administration of gefitinib was able to prevent the outgrowth of
Bam1a tumor cells from palpable lesions, shrink established
tumors, eliminate HER2 and HER3 phosphorylation, and
decrease MAPK and Akt signaling in vivo. A variant of the
Bam1a cell line, IR-5, with acquired ability to grow in 5 Mmol/L
gefitinib was developed and characterized. IR-5 bears a novel
point mutation in the HER2/neu that corresponds to a L726I
in the ATP-binding pocket and correlates with a log decrease
in sensitivity to gefitinib, increased heterodimerization with
EGFR and HER3, and impaired down-regulation. Gene expression profiling of IR-5 showed increased expression of EMP-1,

NOTCH-1, FLT-1, PDGFB, and several other genes that may
contribute to the resistant phenotype and sustain signaling
through MAPK and Akt. This model will be useful in understanding the differences between intrinsic drug sensitivity
and acquired resistance in the context of therapeutic strategies that target oncogene addicted diseases. [Cancer Res 2007;

Introduction
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) play important roles in
regulating normal cell growth by initiating specific intracellular
signaling pathways in response to binding of extracellular growth
factors. A wide variety of cellular functions are modulated by the
four members of the ErbB [or epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR)] family, including regulation of mitogenesis, cell death,
angiogenesis, and cell differentiation (1). The oncogenic potential
of the ErbB family members has been correlated to overexpression
or alterations in a variety of human cancers, including breast,
ovarian, non–small cell lung, glioblastoma, prostate, pancreas, head
and neck, and other cancers (2). Thus, targeting the signaling
activity of the receptor has emerged as an attractive approach for
treatment and prevention of RTK-driven malignancies (3) with
well-appreciated complexity [reviewed by Hynes and Lane (4)].
Signal transduction from the oncogenic HER2/neu leads to
neoplastic transformation, initiation, cellular immortalization, and
tumor progression. This is in part due to dysregulated signaling
through the HER2 kinase domain to the growth and survival pathways. In models of spontaneous tumorigenesis (5), overexpressed
or mutated p185 leads toward the formation of homodimers
or heterodimers with other EGFRs. As these dimers transduce
positive growth signals in a ligand-independent way (6), they are
involved in the initiation and progression of neoplastic transformation (7). Expression of the activated neu oncogene in transgenic
mice has been associated with both the synchronous (single step)
and the stochastic (ref. 8; multistep) transformation of mammary
epithelium. Sequence analyses revealed that activation of neu
occurs through a single amino acid change in the transmembrane
portion of the protein (7). This single point mutation replaces the
valine residue at position 664 in the transmembrane domain of
p185 with glutamic acid, favors p185 homodimerization and
heterodimerization, and transforms the Her-2/neu proto-oncogene
into a dominant transforming oncogene (7).
Monoclonal antibodies specific for the EGFR (9) and HER2 (10)
receptors have been developed with successful clinical outcomes
(10). More recently, several small-molecule inhibitors targeting the
tyrosine kinase domains of specific RTKs have been developed as
therapeutic agents to treat a variety of cancers and include classes
of quinazolines that act as reversible or irreversible small-molecule
competitive substrate (ATP) inhibitors (11).

Cancer Research

In the case of the ErbB family, the preclinical efficacy of EGFRselective, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKI; i.e.,
ZD1839 (gefitinib, Iressa; AstraZeneca) and OSI-774] in EGFRdependent tumor models has been well characterized (12, 13)
ZD1839 (gefitinib) is an orally available, active, selective EGFR TKI
that blocks signal transduction pathways implicated in proliferation
and survival of cancer cells and other host-dependent processes
promoting cancer growth (13–15). In tyrosine kinase activity assays,
EGFR inhibition occurs at IC50 doses of 0.023 to 0.079 Amol/L.
Inhibition of c-erbB-2 (IC50, 3 Amol/L) and KDR/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (3.7–33 Amol/L) also occurs but
at doses 100-fold higher than EGFR inhibition. In vitro, the effect of
gefitinib on human breast, ovarian, and colon cell lines expressing
various amounts of EGFR and/or HER2 has been described as
mainly cytostatic with increasing apoptotic activity at the higher
doses (14, 15). Supra-additive antiproliferative effects were observed
with a broad range of cytotoxics (12, 16) and radiation (17) in vitro
and in vivo. The efficacy of gefitinib in HER2-overexpressing human
breast cancer cell lines has been described and seems to be
contingent upon the expression levels of both HER2 and EGFR as
well as the degree to which these receptors are coupled to the
growth [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)] and survival
(Akt) pathways (14, 15).
In recent studies, a subset of EGFR mutations in lung cancer
patients was shown to correlate with clinical responsiveness to
gefitinib therapy (18). Subsequently, several HER2 and EGFR
mutations and polymorphisms have been identified in a variety
of human tumors that influence patient prognosis and sensitivity
to gefitinib (19) and may alter sensitivity to other RTKIs.
We have already shown the effectiveness of gefitinib on the
phosphorylation and signaling of the oncogenically activated (rat)
HER2/neu in the context of a salivary gland adenocarcinoma (20).
Suppression of HER2 signaling by gefitinib induced profound
cytostasis by silencing growth signaling through MAPK. Nevertheless, cells displayed intrinsic resistance to gefitinib-induced
apoptosis because signaling from the Akt pathway was intact to
sustain survival and inhibition of fas was required for apoptosis.
To test the efficacy of gefitinib in breast cancer expressing the
mutated HER2/neu oncogene, we isolated and characterized a
breast cancer cell line and the mechanisms of gefitinib with respect
to HER2 signal transduction through the growth and survival
pathways as well as proliferation, anchorage-independent growth,
kinetics of cell cycle progression, cell death through apoptosis,
and tumor growth and signal transduction in vivo. Further, we
determined the ability of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer to
develop resistance to this agent and characterized mechanisms
responsible for decreased sensitivity to gefitinib. We determined
that a novel point mutation in the ATP-binding pocket HER2/neu
receptor was responsible for the resistant phenotype and led to
additional genetic alterations that are likely to contribute to
acquired gefitinib resistance.

Materials and Methods
Routine methodology was used as we have previously described (20). The
specific experimental details are provided in Supplementary Methods.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of the Bam1a cell line. The Bam1a cell line
was derived from a mammary gland tumor that developed in a
BALB-NeuT female mouse. Mammary gland tumorigenesis by the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

activated rat HER2 oncogene in female BALB-NeuT transgenic
mice has been described (21). We characterized the tumorigenic
potential of the Bam1a cell line and compared it with the
morphology of the parental. Bam1a cells grown in immunocompetent BALB/c were evaluated using H&E and immunohistochemistry for expression of the HER2 receptor. Histologic features of the
mammary tumor that was used to establish the Bam1a cell line are
shown in Fig. 1A.
When grown from single-cell suspension in the fat pad of female
BALB/c mice, tumors that formed were morphologically similar to
the parental and developed well-circumscribed and encapsulated
nodules, made of smaller acini, separated by fine stroma (Fig. 1A).
Acini have prominent, open lumens so that focally the confluence
of acini creates a cribriform pattern and often are filled with
eosinophilic secretions. The stroma is, overall, more developed
than in the parental tumor, creating a more pronounced division of
the acini and prominent comedo-type necrosis is present.
Immunohistochemistry reveals strong and diffuse positivity for
HER2 that is similar to that of the parental with a similar (f2+)
membrane and cytoplasmic intensity.
Bam1a cells in vitro are uniform and cuboidal in appearance and
grow as monolayers to a high saturation density and are
morphologically similar to several human breast cancer cell lines
(22). When evaluated in monolayer cultures in situ, HER2 receptors
are diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and as
aggregates adjacent to the plasma membrane. Established cultures
express uniformly high levels of HER2 on their cell surface.
We further characterized the Bam1a cell line using microarray
analysis. Lobular carcinomas from BALB-NeuT transgenic animals
have been reported to have a gene expression profile that
resembles the genetic signature of human ErbB-2 breast cancers
of the basal subtype (23, 24) that correlates with aggressive disease
and poor prognosis. The Bam1a cell line has a similar expression
pattern as determined by whole-genome analysis. Highly expressed
genes are reflected in Supplementary Table S1. When compared
with Universal mouse RNA on the Agilent whole-mouse genome
chip containing 44,000 genes, 4,823 gene sequences were identified
as being overexpressed (>2-fold) in Bam1a when compared with
the universal mouse RNA prep. We defined the Bam1a transcriptome of 1,285 (1,045 unique) known genes (Supplementary
Table S1) and compared it with the published profiles of mouse
mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-neu mammary tumors from two
different strains (23, 25) and genes characteristically expressed in
human ErbB-2 breast and basal subtype cancers (24, 26). For
comparative purposes, Supplementary Table S2 lists the genes
commonly overexpressed in Bam1a and MMTV-neu tumors and
cell lines as reported by Astolfi (ref. 23; Supplementary Table S2A)
and genes overexpressed in Neu mammary tumors relative to agematched glands as reported by Landis (ref. 25; Supplementary
Table S2B). The table also includes several genes from the Bam1a
profile that are present in the ‘‘intrinsic’’ gene list published by
Sorlie et al. (24) that was used to define histologic subtypes of
human breast cancers (Supplementary Table S2C) and Bam1a
genes associated with the human ErbB-2 amplicon as described by
Bertucci et al. (ref. 26; Supplementary Table S2D). These data
support the use of the 44K mouse CGH Agilent gene chip and
universal mouse RNA as a screen for defining the genetic signature
of HER2/neu–expressing mouse mammary tumor cell lines and
shows the similarities among Bam1a, independent Neu-expressing
mammary tumors and cell lines, and human ErbB-2 breast cancers.

Figure 1. A (i–iv), histochemical analysis of lobular carcinoma used to derive the Bam1a cell line (i, iii ) and the outgrowth of Bam1a tumor cells in vivo (ii, iv ).
Histochemical analyses of tumors using H&E (i and ii ). Immunohistochemical analyses of the HER2 receptor (iii and iv ) were done on serial paraffin sections as
described in Supplementary Methods. Histologically, the parental tumor was found to be a large, single proliferation, with vaguely multilobular architecture, each
composed of smaller acini, separated by fine stroma, coalescing in varying degrees, and focally forming tightly packed, solid nodules. Acini were mostly devoid of
lumens, or have fine ones, and outlines are ill defined, with lobules expanding irregularly adjacent adipose tissue. By immunohistochemistry, tumor cells showed (iii )
strong and diffuse expression of HER-2, in a membranous pattern, whereas the other histologic components were negative. Bam1a cell line grown in vivo (ii, iv )
in syngenic hosts were morphologically similar to the parental. HER-2 staining is strong and diffuse in a membranous pattern. Magnification, 40. B, effect(s) of
gefitinib on ErbB receptor phosphorylation. Bam1a cells were grown to 80% confluence and subsequently treated by changing growth medium with fresh medium

Methods. Whole-cell lysates (20 Ag/lane) were resolved in 4% to 20% SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with the indicated phosphospecific antibodies and pan actin
was used as a loading control. Doses of gefitinib (Amol/L concentration) are indicated above each lane. C, effect of gefitinib on MAPK signaling. Bam1a cells were grown
to 80% confluence and subsequently treated by changing growth medium with fresh medium containing increasing levels of gefitinib and cultured for 4 or 24 h.

at least four independent preparations of whole-cell lysates. The trends are highly reproducible and consistent. Immunofluorescence photomicrographs: In parallel,
Bam1a cells were grown on glass coverslips, treated with a medium change containing 0 Amol/L (i–iii ) or 1 Amol/L (iv–vi ) gefitinib for 4 h, fixed with methanol, and

*Average fold difference is the ratio (n = 3, P value cutoff >0.05) of Bam1a RNA from gefitinib-treated cells (1 Amol/L, 24 h) to Bam1a RNA from
sham-treated cells. RNA from gefitinib-treated cells was labeled in red (cy5); RNA from sham-treated cells was labeled in green (cy3). Three independent
RNA preparations per condition were analyzed on three separate chips and averaged; a confidence cutoff of >0.95 was used for the raw values
of red/green before normalization. The fold change (**treated/**control) = normalized ratio value(cy5/cy3), fold change cutoff >2 fold (up-regulate),
or <1/2 (down-regulate). The P value represents the consistency between the three replicate samples.

biology and progression are the primary targets for downregulation. In particular, KI67, CYCLINB1, CHEK1, MMP1A, KIF11,
CKAP2, AREG, SKP2, COL1A1, FGF18, MAP2K6, STFA1, ETV4,
S100A14, LGALS9, BIRC5, and CELSR2. Genes that were upregulated by gefitinib included oncogenes, and genes involved in
matrix remodeling, drug metabolism, antiproliferative genes, heat
shock, and DNA damage. These included ADAMTS15, CTSB, HYAL3,
HSPB1, OSMR, OSM, NOTCH1, BGAL1L, BTG2, BMF, DHRS6,
GADD45B, PDGFRA, TRP53INP1, FLT1, NOX4, FMO2, TIMP3,
WNT5B, KIT, LTF, FGFR2, CEBPD, CYP2F2, C3, SULT1A1, and SLPI.
Several have been confirmed by independent microarray Western
blot. Gene signatures are becoming increasingly important in
designing treatment strategies that use agents that target specific
signal transduction pathways (27). In the case of gefitinib, several
studies have identified sensitive and resistant profiles that correlate
with responsiveness (28, 29). These profiles will be discussed when
we compare Bam1a with its resistant variant.
Effect of gefitinib on HER2, ErbB-3, and EGFR receptor
phosphorylation and downstream signaling. Although EGFR is
the preferred target for gefitinib, several groups have shown the
effectiveness of this agent against a variety of HER2-overexpressing
human cell lines, including lung (30) and breast (31). We first
determined the concentration of gefitinib necessary to eliminate
phosphorylation of the HER2/neu, EGFR, and ErbB-3 in Bam1a
cells.
As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment with gefitinib for 4 or 24 h had a
dramatic effect on phosphorylation of all ErbB family members.
Distinct down-regulation of receptor autophosphorylation sites
is evident with 1 Amol/L IR in whole-cell lysates at 4 h of treatment. When treated for 24 h with increasing doses of gefitinib,

autophosphorylation of the activated HER2 signaling domain
decreased in a dose-dependent fashion. Phosphorylation of Tyr1248 and Tyr-1221 of the HER2 was reduced by f50% between the
doses of 1 to 2 Amol/L, as one would expect based on the IC50
(Fig. 1B). EGFR is expressed at a lower level than the HER2
oncogene in these cells and is, as expected, more sensitive to
gefitinib (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation on EGFR Tyr-1173 and Tyr-992
was diminished by f50% by 1 Amol/L but was not completely
eliminated.
It has been well documented that in tissues where ErbB2 is
mutated or overexpressed, it serves as the dominant signaling
receptor due to its promiscuous heterodimerization and impaired
endocytosis (32). The residual phosphorylation that is detected on
the EGFR may represent phosphorylation that persists in HER2/
EGFR heterodimers. Phosphorylation on Tyr-1289 of HER3, the
kinase inactive family member was most sensitive probably due to
its dependence on heterodimerization and transphosphorylation.
At higher doses of gefitinib, total ErbB-3 receptor levels were clearly
up-regulated, suggesting enhanced receptor stabilization in the
presence of gefitinib. This was even more pronounced after 24 h.
Tyrosine phosphorylation on HER2 Tyr-877, the Src phosphorylation site was least sensitive to gefitinib-induced suppression,
consistent with retention of Tyr-416 phosphorylation on Src
(the active state; Fig. 3A) at the same concentrations of gefitinib.
Cross-talk from another signaling pathway that is insensitive to
gefitinib suppression may modulate these interactions. Although
significant decrease in phosphorylation was evident with 1 Amol/L
IR on various tyrosine residues in all three receptors, 6 Amol/L IR
was required for near-complete elimination of phosphotyrosines.
After 24 h, phosphorylation recovered slightly at the lowest doses

of gefitinib (1–2 Amol/L) but dropped sharply as total HER2 and
EGFR levels both decreased coincident with their ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation (not shown).
Downstream of the ErbBs, mitogenic signaling through MAP/
extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2)
and p44/42 MAPK was greatly diminished. Phosphorylation of
MEK1/2 and MAPK was completely eliminated between 1 and
2 Amol/L within 4 h in whole-cell lysates and cytoplasm and
remained absent over 24 h (Fig. 1C) despite the retention of
phosphotyrosines in the autophosphorylation sites of the ErbBs
(Fig. 1B). We also detected a 2-fold increase in cell surface
HER2/neu expression in gefitinib-treated cells by flow cytometry
(not shown) and membrane accentuation by immunofluorescence
(Fig. 1C). This is similar to our finding in salivary gland
carcinoma (20).
We next evaluated the effect of gefitinib on stress signaling
through the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway and
observed a rapid activation of SAPK and JNK in the presence of
gefitinib within 4 h. Using 1 Amol/L gefitinib for 4 h, we observed
that active JNK and c-Jun (not shown) were eliminated from the
cytoplasm and translocated to the nucleus (Fig. 1D). After 24 h,
active JNK (p46) was no longer observed but activation of SAPK
(p54) persisted. Signaling to the serum response factor c-Jun, which

is downstream of both MAPK and JNK, was greatly impaired.
Failure to activate c-Jun would eliminate transcription of genes
modulated by serum and growth factor signaling.
Gefitinib induces cytostasis through multiple mechanisms.
Consistent with the observed suppression of mitogenic signaling,
gefitinib effectively inhibited proliferation of Bam1a cells in a
time- and dose-dependent manner. Within 48 h, a 50% reduction
in the rate of proliferation was observed in the presence of 250 to
500 nmol/L gefitinib (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of anchorage-independent
growth required 1 Amol/L gefitinib (Fig. 2B). Cell cycle analysis
showed the onset of cytostasis within 24 h of treatment with
gefitinib (Fig. 2C). Most studies have characterized the effects
of gefitinib on cell cycle as G0 arrest (14). Similar to our observations in salivary gland carcinoma overexpressing HER2/neu (20),
the effect of gefitinib on Bam1a cell cycle kinetics is primarily
due to inhibition of S-phase entry and execution. At 1 Amol/L,
when maximum inhibition is achieved within 24 h, there is
retention of cells in G0 (49–71%), a sharp decrease in the S-phase
population (23–2%) but no change in the G2M fraction (28–28%).
This cell cycle profile is consistent with the effects of gefitinib
on cell cycle regulators controlling the various phases of the
cell cycle as shown in Fig. 2D. We have obtained qualitatively
and mechanistically similar results using the irreversible inhibitor

Figure 3. A and B, effect of gefitinib on survival signaling and apoptosis. Bam1a cells were grown to 80% confluence and subsequently treated by changing
growth medium with fresh medium containing increasing levels of gefitinib and cultured for 4 or 24 h. Cells were harvested and lysates extracted and processed as
described in Supplementary Methods. Whole-cell lysates (20 Ag/lane) were resolved in 4% to 20% SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with the indicated phosphospecific
or cleavage-specific antibodies and then reprobed with antibodies against total proteins. Doses of gefitinib (Amol/L concentration) are indicated above each lane.
B, gefitinib suppresses cx43 and VEGF-D, alters bcl-2 family members, and induces proteolytic cleavage leading to apoptosis in Bam1a cells. Cell treatment, lysate

Annexin staining. Columns, percentage Annexin V–positive cells detected by flow cytometry after 24 h (open columns ) or 48 h (solid columns ). C and D, the effect of

PD168393 (11) with respect to HER2/neu phosphorylation, signal
transduction, proliferation, and cell cycle (data not shown). We
suspect that similar small-molecule inhibitors with specificities for
the ATP-binding pocket of the EGFR and/or ErbB-2 (i.e., erlotinib,
lapatinib) will have efficacy against this intrinsically sensitive breast
cancer cell line.
Cell cycle arrest was multifactorial and somewhat complex. To
determine mechanisms involved in cytostasis, we evaluated the key
cell cycle regulators controlling each phase and checkpoint of the
cell cycle (Fig. 2D). We observed a significant decrease in the levels
of cell cycle regulators cyclin D1, phosphoSer795Rb, phosphoY15cdc2

within 4 h of treatment. By 24 h, complete inhibition of these
regulators and cyclin B1 is achieved with 1 Amol/L gefitinib, the
dose and time at which MAPK and Akt signaling is silenced
(Figs. 1C and 3A) and cytostasis is achieved (Fig. 2A and C).
Changes in these cell cycle regulators explain the distribution of
cells in the different phases of the cell cycle. Cyclin D1 levels drop
significantly due to ubiquitin-mediated degradation (data not
shown) and increased levels p27 reinforce inhibition of cyclin D1
and progression of the G0-G1 phase. Furthermore, loss of cyclin
D1–dependent activities (by cdk4/6) and suppression cdk2 by
increased levels of p27 would result in hypophosphorylation of Rb

and impaired cell cycle progression through G0. Downstream of
these events, hypophosphorylated Rb binds to E2F and impairs DNA
synthesis and S-phase progression. As a result, the S-G2 transition
does not occur. The hypophosphorylation of cdc2 leads to cyclin B1
ubiquitination and degradation (Fig. 2D) to impair the G2-M
transition. Cell cycle histograms depict cell cycle distribution after
24 h in the absence (Fig. 2D, left) or presence (Fig. 2D, right) of
1 Amol/L gefitinib. Cytostasis is characterized by (a) a decrease in
the percentage of cells in S phase (23–1.4%), (b) accumulation of
cells in G0 (49–71%), and (c) retention of cells G2-M (i.e., 28–28%).
Therefore, G0 arrest and impaired G-S phase transition was due to
decreased levels of cyclin D1 and increased levels of p27 and
hypophosphorylation of Rb causing a retention of cells in G0.
However, accumulation of additional cells in G0 (true G0 arrest) did
not occur due to impaired transitioning through the G2-M
checkpoint, due to decreased cyclin B1 levels.
We also have overwhelming support from our microarray data
that cell cycle regulators are significantly modulated at the
transcriptional level. CYCLIN B1 is a primary target of downregulation and is decreased >30-fold by a 24 h treatment with
1 Amol/L gefitinib relative to cells receiving control medium
(Table 1; Supplementary Table S3). Other cyclins, including A2, B2,
E1, and E2, and the gene encoding KI67 were also transcriptionally
suppressed. Because this treatment is effective in reducing
phosphorylation of HER2/neu, MAPK signaling, proliferation, and
cell cycle, one would expect alterations in gene expression levels to
have a major contribution to the growth and cell cycle suppression
induced by gefitinib and vice versa.
Effects of gefitinib on survival signaling and apoptosis.
Concentrations of gefitinib >1 Amol/L failed to generate additional
therapeutic benefit with respect to proliferation and cell cycle
arrest but higher concentrations were needed to effectively impair
anchorage-independent growth and survival. Inactivation of
survival signaling by gefitinib is usually associated with inhibition
of HER2/EGFR and HER2/HER3 activity (30, 31) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase leading to apoptosis through the intrinsic
(mitochondrial) pathway (33).
The activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB is
modulated by various growth and survival factors. Akt promotes
cell survival through two distinct pathways: inhibition of
proapoptotic (death) signals and activation of IKK-a signaling
to p65 nuclear factor-nh (NF-nh). In Fig. 3A, within 4 h of
treatment with gefitinib, we observed reduction of Akt phosphorylation. At this early time point, the doses (4–6 Amol/L) required
to diminish Akt phosphorylation were higher than those needed
to inhibit HER2/neu (1–2 Amol/L) or MAPK (1 Amol/L). However,
within 24 h, complete inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was
achieved with 1 Amol/L. Inhibition of phosphorylation of signal
transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT3
was similar to that of the EGFR and probably represents crosstalk between these receptors through the MAPK pathway. In
some instances, STATs can serve an autocrine function to induce
cytokine expression and rescue cells undergoing growth factor
deprivation or EGFR inhibition (34). Phosphorylation of NF-nh
p65 was not adversely affected by gefitinib and perhaps slightly
enhanced.
Impaired growth and survival signaling was tightly coupled to
alterations in proapoptotic BH3-only mitochondrial proteins bim
and bad. In the context of HER2 overexpression, bim is
constitutively suppressed through a MAPK-dependent mechanism
(35). Suppression of EGFR/HER2 signaling by gefitinib leads to

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

induction of bim, a rheostat for sensing growth factor deprivation.
We previously reported the induction of bim by gefitinib in salivary
gland carcinoma (20). The early induction of bim by gefitinib in
Bam1a cells at 4 h (Fig. 3B) could be mediated through inhibition
of MAPK as is seen with MEK inhibitors. Bim has also been
implicated in anoikis and was recently shown to be sensitive to
modulation by ERK and MEK inhibitors (35). Transcript levels for
BTG2 and BMF were also increased by gefitinib (Table 1) whereas
survivin transcript levels were decreased. Diminished phosphorylation of bad on serine residue 112, which is under MAPK control,
provides additional support for a dominant role of the mitogenic
pathway in regulation of the bcl-2 family. As a result of the
increased mitochondrial stress generated by gefitinib exposure, the
onset of apoptosis through the caspase cleavage pathway is
detectable within 24 h over a range of doses (Fig. 3B). Within 24 h
of treatment (1 Amol/L gefitinib), 33% of cells undergo apoptosis,
as determined by Annexin binding. Apoptosis increased in a timeand dose-dependent manner coincident with caspase-3 and PARP
cleavage observed within 24 h at 2 Amol/L gefitinib in whole-cell
lysates (Fig. 3B).
The ability of gefitinib to efficiently induce apoptosis in HER2/
neu–overexpressing breast cancer is in contrast to our observations
in salivary gland carcinoma where induction of bim and
hypophosphorylation of bad by gefitinib did not result in caspase
cleavage and apoptosis. Salivary gland carcinoma exhibited an
intrinsic resistance to gefitinib. The primary difference between
these two activated HER2/neu–overexpressing models is in survival
signaling through the Akt pathway. Our data indicate that in
Bam1a breast cancer cells, which express high levels of HER3,
unlike salivary gland carcinoma, HER2 signaling is tightly coupled
to the Akt survival pathway. Several studies have shown that
coexpression of HER2 and HER3 improves tumor cell sensitivity to
gefitinib and other RTKIs by coupling it to the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase pathway to facilitate down regulation of the survival
signaling pathway (30). In cell lines where gefitinib impedes the
Akt/survival signaling pathway (33) apoptosis occurs through the
intrinsic pathway.
Novel targets of gefitinib in breast cancer. We also observed
that Bam1a cells express hyperphosphorylated form of the gap
junction protein connexin43 (cx43) in culture. Hyperphosphorylated cx43 impairs GJIC and cell-cell coupling and this form of the
protein has been shown to be up-regulated in breast hyperplasias
and carcinomas and neoformed capillaries (36). Upon treatment
with gefitinib, there is a marked reduction in the phosphorylated
form of cx43 within 4 h (Fig. 3B). By 24 h, cx43 protein is no longer
detected. Regulation of cx43 by gefitinib probably represents
several distinct mechanisms. Direct mechanisms of gefitinib that
are mediated through tyrosine kinase and MAPK activities can
alter cx43 phosphorylation, transcription, and degradation. Indirect
mechanisms that can modulate cx43 may occur through the effects
of gefitinib on the dynamics of cell cycle, cell growth, adhesion, and
cytoskeletal remodeling. Our microarray analyses did not reveal a
change in cx43 expression but did indicate that two other gap
junction genes (GJB4 and GJC1) were sensitive to modulation at
the transcriptional level along with multiple adhesion molecules
and cytoskeletal kinases that affect connexin trafficking, stability,
and assembly.
The c-fos–inducible lymphangiogenic factor, VEGF-D (37), is also
dramatically reduced at 1 Amol/L gefitinib within 24 h. Loss of
activated c-Jun in the cytoplasm and nucleus of Bam1a treated with
gefitinib may contribute to decreased expression of VEGF-D. Many

groups have reported the antiangiogenic effects of gefitinib as
decreases in VEGF (13, 38) and/or interleukin-8 (39), but there have
been no reports of gefitinib effects on expression of VEGF-D.
These two novel targets of gefitinib, cx43 and VEGF-D, may have
important implications in the clinical management of breast cancer.
Disruption of cx43 inhibits breast cancer diapedesis (40) and
disruption of VEGF-D impairs lymphangiogenesis, providing a novel
mechanism for abolishing tumor cell extravasation and metastasis.
Effectiveness of gefitinib in vivo. To determine our ability to
effectively target HER2 growth and survival signaling in vivo, we
challenged mice with Bam1a tumor cells and tested the ability of
gefitinib to suppress tumor outgrowth and shrink established
tumors. We originally observed that 50 mg/kg gefitinib was able to
suppress the outgrowth of small palpable Bam1a nodules when
administered daily for 5 days a week. This dose was effective for
3 weeks, at which time nodules began to increase in size in the
50 mg/kg treatment group, subsequent treatment of these animals
with 100 mg/kg was able to impede tumor growth (not shown).
Animals bearing established Bam1a tumors were effectively treated
with 100 mg/kg gefitinib as this dose administered 5 days a
week for 4 weeks eliminated tumor burden (Fig. 3C). Finally, we
established that we could effectively target HER2 in naturally
occurring mammary LCIS tumor-bearing female transgenic mice
and detected reduced levels of phosphorylated HER2, HER3, MAPK,
and Akt phosphorylation in tumor biopsies taken from animals
treated for 5 consecutive days with 100 mg/kg gefitinib (Fig. 3D).
These findings establish that we can indeed target HER2/neu signal
transduction pathways in naturally occurring tumors in vivo.
These preliminary findings using the Bam1a cell line show the
effectiveness of gefitinib in targeting the signaling pathways
downstream of the HER2/neu oncogene and mechanisms of
action. The acquisition of resistance in this intrinsically sensitive
cell line could represent the development of mutations in the
target receptor that reduce drug binding, biochemical uncoupling
of receptor kinase activity from specific growth and survival
signaling pathways, and/or alterations in gene expression that
minimize the role of RTKs in tumor cell survival. The issues of
intrinsic and acquired resistance or hypersensitivity to RTK
inhibitors have been addressed by several investigations. Recently,
several somatic and acquired mutations in the EGFR (41, 42) and
HER2 (43) have been identified, which alter responsiveness to
gefitinib and other RTKIs (44, 45). These mutations dictate levels of
intrinsic sensitivity or resistance at the level of the target receptor.
In some instances, the outgrowth of resistant subpopulations in
previously sensitive tumors has shown the presence of additional
receptor mutations that dramatically reduce the IC50 (44). The
intrinsic resistance in tumors lacking receptor mutations occurs
through other biochemical mechanisms that uncouple receptor
phosphorylation and catalytic activity from downstream signaling
to growth and survival targets and usually relate to constitutively
active survival signaling intermediates or loss of negative
regulatory factors.
Characterizing the mechanism(s) responsible for acquired
resistance also generates a valuable tool for dissecting and
mapping interactions and the potential for the development of
autocrine or paracrine pathways that emerge as a consequence of
chronic pathway suppression or attenuation. This is supported by
the observation that the mechanisms responsible for the acquired
resistance to the ErbB2 TKI, lapatinib, in breast cancer cells,
reflects a shift in the sole dependence of cell survival on the ErbB-2
to a codependence on the ErbB-2 and estrogen receptor via

www.aacrjournals.org

activation of factors that enhance the transcriptional activity of the
estrogen receptor (46).
In the case of gefitinib resistance, EGFR receptor mutations that
alter the ATP-binding cleft differentially stabilize or destabilize
gefitinib binding and competition for ATP, leading to altered
hydrolysis and catalytic rate of the kinase (47). The L858A mutation
in the activation loop increases kinase activity and sensitivity to
gefitinib (41). In subpopulations, patients with the L858A mutation
that originally respond to gefitinib, outgrowth of resistant tumors
harbor a second mutation at codon 790. This T790M mutation in
the hinge region decreases sensitivity to gefitinib f100-fold (48).
Several somatic exon 20 mutations in HER2 have also been
identified in lung adenocarcinomas. Insertion of YVMA at codon
776 in the HER2 kinase domain confers resistance to gefitinib and a
gain of function (49).
Acquired resistance to gefitinib in Bam1a cells. We developed
a variant of the Bam1a cell line from a soft agar colony that grew in
the presence of gefitinib. Cells that were recovered from this colony
were continuously exposed to medium supplemented with
gefitinib. Concentrations of gefitinib were gradually increased over
time. The clone that we developed, designated IR-5, grows in
5 Amol/L gefitinib. Compared with the parental cell line, IR-5 cells
display a disorganized growth pattern in culture and a lack of
contact inhibition. Cells express lower levels of HER2/neu on their
cell surface compared with the parental cell line (Fig. 4A). To
characterize the mechanisms associated with the acquired
resistance to gefitinib, we first compared the effect of gefitinib on
HER2 receptor phosphorylation and heterodimerization in the
parental Bam1a cell line and the resistant IR-5 cell line. As shown
in Fig. 4B, HER2 phosphorylation is eliminated in Bam1a cells
treated with 5 Amol/L gefitinib and preserved in IR-5 cells up to
15 Amol/L gefitinib. Decreased phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR
correlated with an increase receptor migration in SDS-PAGE in
whole-cell lysates and HER2 immunoprecipitates. Phosphorylation
of ErbB-3 is not detected in Bam1a treated with gefitinib. In control
Bam1a cells, ErbB-3 that is present in HER2/ErbB-3 heterodimers is
weakly phosphorylated and gefitinib completely eliminates this
phosphorylation. In IR-5, phosphorylation of ErbB-3 is detected at
all concentrations of gefitinib. HER2/ErbB-3 heterodimers are more
abundant in IR-5 cells compared with Bam1a cells. Phosphorylation of ErbB-3 in HER2/neu heterodimers is slightly reduced in IR-5
treated with 15 Amol/L gefitinib and correlates with the reduction
in HER2/neu phosphorylation observed at this dose. Similarly, we
observe increased migration of EGFR in HER2 heterodimers in IR-5
treated with 15 Amol/L gefitinib, suggesting decreased EGFR
phosphorylation. In Bam1a cells, EGFR and HER2/EGFR heterodimers show increased migration upon treatment with gefitinib.
Others have shown that HER2 kinase domain mutations show
increased kinase activity over the wild-type receptor and increased
association with and phosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB-3 (49).
These mutant HER2 also form gefitinib-resistant ErbB-3 and EGFR
heterodimers and confer a malignant phenotype. Similar to these
studies, we found that EGFR homodimers in IR-5 cells were also
less sensitive to inhibition by gefitinib than in Bam1a cells (Fig. 4C).
Phosphotyrosine is not detected in EGFR homodimers from Bam1a
treated with gefitinib and total EGFR is dramatically reduced and
coimmunoprecipitates with hsp60, indicative of receptor downregulation. The HER2 that coimmunoprecipitates with EGFR in
these cells is also down-regulated. In IR-5 cells, EGFR homodimers
are less sensitive to gefitinib-induced down-regulation than the
parental cell line. We observe a slight decrease in EGFR

of the human ErbB-2 orthologue. Homologous sequences from the human EGFR and human ErbB-2 (identical in the rat HER2/neu orthologue) are aligned. Dashes,

phosphorylation with 5 Amol/L gefitinib but this does not result in
increased EGFR migration or association with hsp60. Treatment
with 15 Amol/L was effective in decreasing EGFR phosphorylation
and increasing receptor migration and coupling to hsp60. ErbB-2
that coimmunoprecipitates with EGFR are also down-regulated.
These data show a log-shift in the HER2/neu sensitivity to gefitinib
in IR-5 cells and resembles resistance that occurs through receptor
mutations. Acquired resistance to imatinib is associated with T334I
mutation of c-Abl. Acquired resistance to gefitinib is associated
with T790M mutation of the EGFR (48). Pharmacophore modeling
has shown that the sites of these mutations align. It is proposed
that T790M in the hinge region of the ATP-binding pocket causes
ligand to escape (47).
Gefitinib-induced mutation of the HER2/neu. We sequenced
the HER2/neu from the parental and IR-5 cell lines to determine
whether similar mutations had emerged that could explain the
observed resistance. We detected a single nucleotide point
mutation of C to A (Note: G to T on the antisense strand shown

in Fig. 4D) that changes the conserved leucine at codon 726 to an
isoleucine relative to the human erbB-2 (Fig. 4D). This sequence is
conserved between human and rat and aligns with a homologous
region in exon 18 of the human EGFR. These regions encode a
portion of the ATP-binding pocket that is highly conserved among
the human EGFR and erbB-2 and the orthologous rat HER2/neu
transgene (Fig. 4D). No additional mutations in or around the
transmembrane region or the kinase domain were detected. When
aligned with the EGFR, this residue is within hydrophobic region II
that represents the hydrophobic slot of the ATP-binding pocket. It
is possible that this mutation is sufficient to alter the competition
between ATP and gefitinib in favor of ATP, leading to hydrolysis,
receptor autophosphorylation, and kinase activity.
Several mutations have been detected in this region of the EGFR
(50). We denote two in particular that correspond to enhanced
sensitivity (i.e., G719S) and resistance (i.e., E709G) to gefitinib in the
clinic and in vitro (50, 51). Thus, our novel mutation in the HER2/
neu corresponds to a site in the EGFR that is frequently mutated in

Mechanisms of Gefitinib in Mammary Gland Cancer

human cancers with differential sensitivity and resistance to
gefitinib. We are not aware of any reports of a similar mutation in
this region of ErbB-2 that correlate with intrinsic or acquired
sensitivity or resistance to specific inhibitors. We suspect that
decreased sensitivity of the EGFR and ErbB-3 to gefitinib (in IR-5
cells Fig. 4B and C) is mediated through the mutated HER2/neu
and not the result of mutations in either of these receptors. This is
supported by the fact that mutant HER2 with resistance to EGFR
RTKIs harbor a gain of function that endows them with the
capacity to heterodimerize and transphosphorylate kinase-dead
EGFR and ErbB-3 (49).
Altered signaling activity of the mutated HER2/neu and/or
selection in the presence of gefitinib may have lead to additional
genetic changes that are commonly seen in HER2-expressing cell
lines with intrinsic resistance to gefitinib. To characterize the
mutated receptor and resistant phenotype, we compared the gene
expression profiles of the parental Bam1a cell line and IR-5 under
various treatment conditions and the effects of gefitinib on signal
transduction pathways, cell cycle, and apoptosis in IR-5 cells.
We used the 44K mouse CGH array to generate an expression
profile of the IR-5 cell line and compared it with the gene
expression profile of the sensitive, parental cell line, Bam1a. Using a
2-fold cutoff limit and P > 0.05, we identified 1,642 divergent genes
between the two cell lines. From this, we generated a list of 475
(430 unique) known genes that were differentially expressed by
2-fold or greater. This comprehensive gene list is provided as
Supplementary Table S4 and a selection of these genes is given in
Table 2. Several striking differences in the gene expression profiles
of these two cell lines include the overrepresentation of Notch
signaling–related genes in IR-5 cells as well as the presence of
several genes that have recently been linked to clinical resistance to
gefitinib. Notch pathway genes that are increased in IR-5 include
NOTCH-1 (6-fold), NOTCH-3 (2.3-fold), JAG-1 (3.5-fold), JAG-2 (5.6fold), MTAP1B (3.8-fold), MMP7 (7.7-fold), CBL (2.9-fold), NFjb1
(2.1-fold), CD44 (2.1-fold), and b-CATENIN (2.8-fold). Overexpression of activated Notch-1 and Notch-3 has been shown to induce
mammary tumor formation in mice (52). Additional up-regulated
genes that may contribute to the resistant phenotype include FLT-1,
PDGFB, MAF, CAV1, and EFNA1. In breast cancer models with
acquired resistance to the ErbB-2–specific kinase inhibitor,
lapatinib, resistant tumor cells amplify signaling through the
estrogen receptor pathway, leading to the up-regulation of Foxo3a
and caveolin (46). Although we also detect a 3.5-fold increase in
caveolin in gefitinib-resistant IR-5 cells, a functional role for this
protein in our estrogen receptor–negative cell line is not predicted.
Thus, in the context of HER-2–overexpressing estrogen receptor–
negative breast cancer, acquired resistance to gefitinib amplifies
genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway.
By examining the genes that are down-regulated in IR-5 and
abundantly expressed in the parental cell line, it is possible to
detect a trend in the genes that correlate with intrinsic sensitivity
to gefitinib. For instance, elevated expression of the EGFR,
phosphatases (DUSP18, PPP2R2B); drug-metabolizing enzymes
(ABCG2, EPHX2, CYP2J6, and NOX4) and apoptosis and cell cycle
regulators (TRAF1, STK17B, P15, and GSPT2) in Bam1a cells may
facilitate the antiproliferative and proapototic activity of gefitinib.
Indeed, gene profiling of NSCLC cell lines with mutant and wildtype EGFR was used to identify genes that could globally predict
gefitinib sensitivity or resistance (28). We compared our list of
differentially expressed genes to this data set and found
concordance between several genes, attesting to the robustness

of these specific markers, as they predict drug sensitivity in diverse
tumor targets (lung and breast) of differing etiologies and primary
oncogene dependence (EGFR and HER2). The three genes that
were commonly up-regulated in IR-5 and gefitinib resistant lung
cancers included MAP1B, CDH2, and GAS5, and two genes that
were preferentially expressed in Bam1a and gefitinib-sensitive lung
cancers included TMEM30B and ALDH1A3. These similarities
suggest that resistance developed by exposure to gefitinib amplifies
genes involved in intrinsic resistance to gefitinib.
In the case of acquired resistance, one biomarker, EMP-1, has
been identified in vivo and validated as a clinical marker of de novo
and acquired resistance to gefitinib (29). Serial passage and
continued exposure of a HER2-overexpressing adenocarcinoma to
gefitinib in vivo resulted in the emergence of a gefitinib-resistant
variant with a >10-fold increase in expression of EMP-1. Clinical
samples from gefitinib-treated patients correlated with this
observation. We found that relative to the parental Bam1a cell
line, IR-5 cells with acquired in vitro resistance to gefitinib have a
6.6-fold increase EMP-1 and a 2.1-fold increase in EMP-2. Our data
support a role for EMP-1 expression in the acquisition of resistance
to gefitinib in a HER-2–overexpressing adenocarcinoma.
Reviewing trends in gene expression data, we observed that
several genes that were differentially expressed between Bam1a and
IR-5 were also targets that were sensitive to modulation by gefitinib
in Bam1a cells. We found that 57 genes (11.2%) that were
modulated by gefitinib in Bam1a cells were also differentially
expressed between Bam1a and IR-5. In this comparison (Supplementary Table S5), 33 of the gefitinib-induced changes in Bam1a
corresponded to the difference between Bam1a and IR-5, whereas
24 were inconsistent. It is interesting to conceive that this subset
of gefitinib-responsive genes may have an active role in driving and
maintaining resistance to gefitinib.
Because resistance to gefitinib in the IR-5 cell line is not complete
with respect to the phosphorylation of the HER2/neu, we used high
doses of gefitinib to characterize mechanism(s) of responsiveness at
the transcriptional and signal transduction levels to determine the
similarities and differences between Bam1a and IR-5. Treatment of
IR-5 cells with 10 Amol/L gefitinib induced change in expression
levels of 338 genes, 200 known genes, and 190 unique when
compared with basal gene expression of cells cultured in 5 Amol/L
gefitinib. This complete list is provided as Supplementary Table S6
and includes 14 up-regulated genes and 184 down-regulated genes.
We found that several genes that were sensitive to high-dose
gefitinib in IR-5 cells were also sensitive when an irreversible EGFR
inhibitor was tested against gefitinib-resistant, EGFR mutant cell
lines (53). These genes included AREG, CENPA, CCNB1, DEPDC1A,
FOSL1, HMMR, KNTC2, NEK2, NUSAP1, and SHCBP1 and are
deemed to be critical in antiproliferative and antisurvival response
in gefitinib-resistant cells bearing mutant HER family members.
Although gefitinib-resistant cells can still respond to EGFR/HER-2–
targeted therapies, the extent of the response is blunted due to
compromised signaling activities of the mutant receptors per se and
genetic changes that provide cells with compensatory mechanisms
and survival pathways similar to those associated with intrinsic
drug resistance. The extent to which these cell lines still depend on
the HER2/EGFR for growth and survival will determine the utility of
targeting the HER2 axis to control these diseases and understanding
the mechanism(s) of resistance will indicate treatment modalities
that could be successful.
Relative to the parental Bam1a cell line, the number of gefitinibresponsive genes in IR-5 cells and the level of modulation is

Bam1a RNA normalized to Universal Mouse RNA versus IR-5 RNA normalized to Universal Mouse RNA. RNA from the cell lines was labeled in red (cy5),
Universal RNA is labeled in green (cy3). Three independent RNA preparations per condition were analyzed on three separate chips and averaged; a
confidence cutoff of >0.95 was used for the raw values of red/green before normalization. The fold change (**Bam1a/**Universal Mouse) = normalized

dramatically reduced. Nevertheless, we were able to determine that
several genes remained responsive to gefitinib in IR-5 cells,
indicating the preservation of specific signaling pathways involved
in transcriptional responses. Supplementary Table S7 lists the 26
genes that remain responsive to gefitinib in IR-5 cells. Only one
gene, V-MAF, is consistently up-regulated. Twenty-five genes,
including, AREG, BCHE, CXCL4, CYCLINB1, SHCBP1, MMP1A,
MSH5, and PI16, are consistently down-regulated by gefitinib. This
set of genes probably plays a functional role in preserving the

mechanism(s) of responsiveness to gefitinib despite the other
genetic changes that have evolved during the acquisition of
resistance.
To evaluate the effect of gefitinib in the culture medium of IR-5
cells, we determined the gene expression pattern of IR-5 cells after
gefitinib washout. We observed 382 genetic changes consisting of
176 known and 168 unique genes. To our surprise, the majority,
154 genes, were down-regulated and only 22 genes were found to
be increased. These data suggest that the presence of gefitinib is

required for maintaining the expression of several genes. If the
presence of gefitinib in the culture medium was responsible for the
suppression of specific genes, we would expect that elimination of
gefitinib would restore gene expression. This was the case for
TOPIIA (3.25), LPD (2.31), MMP10 (3.65), MMP1A (2.32), SERPINA11
(4.14), and USP26 (2.89). Two of these genes, MMP1A and LPD, are
also sensitive to suppression by high-dose gefitinib. The phenotypic
consequences of these genetic changes was further evaluated by
characterizing the effects of high-dose gefitinib treatment on IR-5
compared with the response pattern profile of the parental cell line.
Effects of gefitinib on IR-5 cells. In IR-5 cells, treatment with
12 Amol/L gefitinib for 24 h was required to diminish phosphorylation of HER2 (Fig. 5A). At this dose, ErbB-3 phosphorylation and
EGFR levels were also reduced. Interestingly, c-Cbl levels were
increased in IR-5 cell lysates compared with Bam1a. This correlates

with the increased (2.9-fold) gene expression levels in IR-5 cells
(Table 2). However, phosphorylation of cbl was dramatically
reduced in IR-5, even in the absence of gefitinib. Dephosphorylated
cbl abrogates CIN85 binding and receptor internalization, leading
to enhanced receptor stabilization. These data may indicate altered
trafficking of the mutated HER2 in IR-5 cells. Mutant EGFR has
been shown to preferentially associate with underphosphorylated
cbl to impede internalization (54). Although we are able to achieve
considerable down-regulation of receptor phosphorylation with
15 Amol/L of gefitinib in IR-5 cells, MAPK and STAT3 phosphorylation persist (Fig. 5B). Cross-talk between pathways or establishment of an autocrine loop (34) capable of signaling through these
coupled effectors are likely to be responsible for this observation.
This in contrast to the profile generated by Bam1a at 2 Amol/L
where residual phosphorylation on HER2 is still detected and the

phosphorylation of MAPK is eliminated. On the other hand, in IR-5
cells, decreased phosphorylation of c-Jun and S6 still correspond to
the dose-response for HER2 phosphorylation, suggesting that these
signaling pathways remain tightly coupled to HER2 activity.
Preserved signaling through the MAPK pathways suggests decreased dependence on the HER2 for growth signals and the
amplification/development of another source coupled to the
MAPK pathway.
We observe differential sensitivity of several downstream targets
of HER2 in response to the gefitinib-induced decrease in HER2
phosphorylation. For example, VEGF-D modulation by gefitinib is
no longer observed; this may be secondary to retention of MAPK
signaling (Fig. 5B). Similarly, changes in protein levels of the cell
cycle regulators pSer795Rb, cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and p27 were less
dramatic relative to the parental cell line (Fig. 5C). CYCLIN B1
transcript levels were reduced 2.2-fold in IR-5 treated for 24 h with
10 Amol/L gefitinib. This reduction in cyclin B1 is 11-fold lower
than that achieved by 1 Amol/L gefitinib in Bam1a cells. Cell cycle
analysis shows that 9 Amol/L IR is required to impair cell cycle
kinetics of IR-5 cells (Fig. 5D) when compared with the cytostasis
achieved with 1 Amol/L IR in Bam1a (Fig. 2C). Consistent with
retention of MAPK signaling and cell cycle regulators, a complete
elimination of the S-phase population and G2 block was not
observed in IR-5 cells. This cytostatic response in IR-5 cells was
incomplete and transient, as an increase in the S-phase population
was observed at all doses of gefitinib within 48 h (not shown). We
also evaluated the integrity/fidelity of signaling to the survival
pathway through Akt and apoptosis. Akt phosphorylation was
modestly reduced at 15 Amol/L gefitinib at 24 h in IR-5 cells
compared with complete elimination in Bam1a with 2 Amol/L
(Fig. 5B). The observed induction of bim expression at this dose
(15 Amol/L gefitinib; Fig. 5C) in IR-5 cells suggests a connection
between bim expression, HER2/neu phosphorylation, and the Akt
pathway.
Acquired resistance to gefitinib in HER2-overexpressing breast,
prostate, and gastric cancers has been attributed to the upregulation of growth factor receptors [i.e., insulin-like growth
factor-IR (55) and EGFR (56)] to create compensatory signaling
pathways that couple to MAPK and drive cell growth. Under this
paradigm, it is reasonable to suggest that the coupling of Notch
signaling pathways to MAPK and Akt (57) is a potential mechanism
contributing to the resistance observed in IR-5 cells.
Elimination of gefitinib from the culture medium also restored
cx43 expression in whole-cell lysates extracted from IR-5 cells, but
this expression level is substantially lower than that observed in the
parental Bam1a cells, suggesting altered regulation of cx43 in IR-5
cells. Microarray analysis suggested that transcript levels of GJA-1

were not sensitive to changes in gefitinib concentration 0 or
10 Amol/L gefitinib compared with 5 Amol/L gefitinib. Finally,
induction of apoptosis in IR-5 cells required treatment with
>15 Amol/L gefitinib for at least 48 h compared (Fig. 5D) with
24-h incubation of Bam1a cells with 1 Amol/L gefitinib (Fig. 3B).
The equivalent level of apoptosis that is achieved with 1 to 2 Amol/L
gefitinib between 24 and 48 h in Bam1a cells requires 15 Amol/L
gefitinib for 48 to 72 h in IR-5 cells.
These data show that mammary tumor cells overexpressing the
activated rat HER2-neu have a high level of intrinsic sensitivity to
gefitinib via inhibition of receptor signaling through the MAPK and
Akt pathways in vitro and in vivo. Continuous exposure of these
tumor cells results in the acquisition of gefitinib and the ability to
grow in the presence of 5 Amol/L gefitinib. Acquired resistance to
gefitinib in Bam1a cells is associated with a novel mutation in the
ATP-binding pocket of the HER2 that alters its sensitivity to
gefitinib. Resistance is characterized by a decreased fidelity in the
signaling pathways from HER2 to MAPK and Akt and is
phenotypically similar to aberrant signal transduction that has
been observed in cells with intrinsic resistance to gefitinib. The upregulation of constitutively active survival factors also contribute to
the resistant phenotype observed in IR-5 cells. Genes that are
differentially expressed and regulated by gefitinib in Bam1a and
IR-5 cells have been associated with intrinsic and acquired
resistance to gefitinib and the amplification of genes involved in
Notch signaling. These data suggest that acquired resistance to
gefitinib can be treated by strategies that target genes/pathways
used to achieve HER2 independence.
The relationship between the receptor mutation and resistant
phenotype will be tested by cloning and transfection of the wildtype and resistant receptors in a genetic background that has not
been selected for resistance. Aspects of acquired and intrinsic
resistance are being investigated by using specific chemical
inhibitors and small interfering RNA that target NOTCH-1, PDGFB,
FLT-1, and several other genes to validate their functional role(s) in
mediating resistance to gefitinib.
