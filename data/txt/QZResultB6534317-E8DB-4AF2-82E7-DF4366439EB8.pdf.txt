ABSTRACT
Evasive mechanisms triggered by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib reduce
its efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. Drug-resistant cancer
cells frequently exhibit sphingolipid dysregulation, reducing chemotherapeutic
cytotoxicity via the induction of ceramide-degrading enzymes. However, the
role of ceramide in sorafenib therapy and resistance in HCC has not been clearly
established. Our data reveals that ceramide-modifying enzymes, particularly
glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), are upregulated during sorafenib treatment in
hepatoma cells (HepG2 and Hep3B), and more importantly, in sorafenib-resistant
cell lines. GCS silencing or pharmacological GCS inhibition sensitized hepatoma
cells to sorafenib exposure. GCS inhibition, combined with sorafenib, triggered
cytochrome c release and ATP depletion in sorafenib-treated hepatoma cells,
leading to mitochondrial cell death after energetic collapse. Conversely, genetic GCS
overexpression increased sorafenib resistance. Of interest, GCS inhibition improved
sorafenib effectiveness in a xenograft mouse model, recovering drug sensitivity of
sorafenib-resistant tumors in mice. In conclusion, our results reveal GCS induction
as a mechanism of sorafenib resistance, suggesting that GCS targeting may be a
novel strategy to increase sorafenib efficacy in HCC management, and point to
target the mitochondria as the subcellular location where sorafenib therapy could
be potentiated.

incidence of HCV [2, 3]. HCC is often diagnosed in an
advanced stage characterized by resistance to current
therapy, when curative strategies are no longer applicable.
The establishment of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib
as the standard of care has opened a window of hope for
HCC patients with very poor prognosis [3]. However,
this promising systemic treatment has limited survival

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most

benefits with low rates of tumor response, probably due
to the existence of primary and acquired drug resistance
mechanisms [4, 5]. Several drugs are now in the pipeline
for HCC application, either alone or in combination with
sorafenib, but the lack of positive results complicates
their clinical application. Additionally, effective therapy
combinations may reveal novel targets of treatment for
HCC [4–6].
Ceramide is a bioactive sphingolipid generated
in response to a wide range of stimuli, including
chemotherapeutic agents, which triggers cell death [7].
Transient or sustained ceramide generation (Suppl. Fig.
1), either by sphingomyelinases activation or de novo
synthesis, respectively [7, 8], can be limited by the
concurrent activation of ceramide-degrading enzymes,
which reduce the efficacy of drug therapy on tumor
cells [8, 9]. For instance, glucosylceramide synthase
(GCS) catalyzes the generation of glucosylceramide
from ceramide while ceramidases (CDases) deacylate
ceramide to sphingosine, which is then phosphorylated
to sphingosine-1-phosphate by sphingosine kinases. Both
pathways have been characterized in drug-resistance
as protective mechanisms triggered by tumor cells after
cancer treatment [8, 10, 11]. In liver cancer, increasing
intratumoral ceramide levels with nanoliposomal
administration has been used as a strategy in the treatment
of HCC [12], while targeting acid CDase (ACDase)
potentiated the cytotoxic effect of daunorubicin in
hepatoma cells [13]. Regarding sorafenib action, recent
data has shown the efficacy of combining sorafenib
with recombinant acid sphingomyelinase, a ceramidegenerating enzyme, in experimental liver cancer [14],
or with nanoliposomal ceramide in melanoma or breast
cancer [15]. These findings have proposed a role for
sphingolipids in sorafenib toxicity [16], but a detailed
analysis of ceramide metabolism in vitro and in vivo HCC
models after sorafenib treatment has not been previously
reported.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our data indicate that, although sorafenib alters the
sphingolipidic metabolism in hepatoma cells via ASMase
activation, ceramide toxicity is partially reduced by the
simultaneous induction of ceramide-eliminating enzymes,
in particular GCS. Moreover, pharmacological or genetic
GCS antagonism sensitized hepatoma cells to sorafenib
by a caspase-independent mitochondrial-dependent
mechanism. Moreover, GCS is upregulated in resistant
hepatoma cells after long-term exposure to sorafenib,
pointing to GCS targeting as an effective approach to resensitize tumor cells to sorafenib. Therefore, our results
validate the interest of ceramide-focused strategies to
increase sorafenib effectiveness in HCC and confirm
mitochondria as the subcellular site responsible for these
effects.

RESULTS
Sorafenib increases ceramide levels and the
expression of enzymes involved in ceramide
metabolism in Hep3B cells
Despite several evidences showing the influence
of ceramide-related compounds in sorafenib efficacy
[14, 15], the effect of sorafenib on ceramide metabolism
has not been evaluated. Among critical sphingolipidic
genes (Suppl. Fig. 1), we found that overnight sorafenib
exposure increased expression of genes responsible
for ceramide production (Table 1) by sphingomyelin
hydrolysis (acid sphingomyelinase, ASMase) or de novo
synthesis (serine palmitoyl transferase, SPT, ceramide
synthase 2, CerS2). In parallel, genes involved in ceramide
modification via ceramidase degradation (acid ceramidase,
ACDase, and sphingosine kinase 1, SK1) or glycosylation
(glucosylceramide synthase, GCS) were also increased.
Moreover, in another hepatoma cell line, HepG2, sorafenib
also increased ceramide formation through ASMase and
glycosylation via GCS (Suppl. Table 1).

Rapid changes in ceramide concentration due to
ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents are induced
by ASMase stimulation, while sustained ceramide
increase via de novo synthesis occurs through activation
of ceramide synthases, such as CerS2 and CerS4, which
exhibit predominant liver expression [20, 21]. Timeresponse analysis in Hep3B cells showed both increases
(Figure 1A), in ASMase and in de novo ceramide
synthesis (SPT and CerS2). Moreover, sorafenib induced
the expression of GCS and ACDase, which metabolize
ceramide, as well as SK1. These effects were accompanied
by changes in ceramide levels upon sorafenib treatment.
Ceramide increased dose-dependently, being significant
for all doses (from 2.5 to 20 μM) after 4 h of sorafenib
exposure (Figure 1B).

from the sphingomyelin pathway, at doses that caused
no effect in hepatoma cell growing. Imipramine reduced
significantly sorafenib-induced cell death (Figure 1C),
while myriocin (Figure 1D) or fumonisin B1 (FB1) (data
not shown), another blocker of the de novo pathway [22],
caused no effect in sorafenib action, further confirming
a contributory role of ASMase activation in sorafenib
toxicity [14].
To examine if forcing ceramide accumulation could
increase sorafenib cytotoxicity in vitro, we tested cell
viability after inhibition of ACDase with NOE (Figure
2A), or GCS with PDMP in sorafenib-treated Hep3B cells
(Figure 2B). Cell death was augmented significantly upon
inhibition of GCS and ACDase, and similar effects were
observed with PDMP but not NOE in sorafenib-exposed
HepG2 cells (Suppl. Fig. 2). Of note, neither PDMP nor
NOE alone caused damage to primary mouse hepatocytes
as previously reported [13, 18], having no significant
effect on sorafenib toxicity in normal hepatocytes (data
not shown). Moreover, changes in ceramide content after
inhibition of ACDase with NOE or GCS with PDMP
were confirmed in sorafenib-treated Hep3B cells (Figure
2C). Remarkably, GCS inhibition was more effective
increasing ceramide levels after sorafenib exposure, in
line with greater sorafenib toxicity induced by PDMP,
and further demonstrating the upregulation of ceramide
metabolism after sorafenib exposure. Interestingly, we
detected GCS but not in ACDase induction by sorafenib

enzymes modulates sorafenib-induced toxicity in

To examine the role of the ceramide production/
degradation pathways in sorafenib cytotoxicity, we
administered sphingolipid inhibitors combined with
sorafenib in hepatoma cells (Suppl. Fig. 1). First, we
used myriocin (MYR, 5 μM), which targets ceramide
de novo biosynthesis by inhibiting SPT; and imipramine
(IMIP, 15 μM), tricyclic antidepressant and effective
ASMase inhibitor [22], to block ceramide generation

(Figure 2D) in Hep3B cells, despite of increased ACDase
(Figure 1A). These results were confirmed by western blot
in samples from Hep3B (Figure 2E) and in HepG2 cells
(Figure 2F), paralleling the increase seen at the mRNA
levels of GCS in both hepatoma cell lines after sorafenib
addition. Therefore, our results indicated that the blockage
of ceramide-modifying enzymes, particularly GCS,
potentiates ceramide contribution to sorafenib toxicity.

To further verify the contribution of ceramide in
sorafenib cytotoxicity, hepatoma cells were transfected
with siRNAs against GCS and ACDase analyzing

elicited increased sorafenib toxicity (Figure 3B). Similarly,
HepG2 cells transfected with GCS siRNA displayed
higher sensitivity to sorafenib (Suppl. Fig. 3). However,
ACDase silencing (Figure 3C), did not sensitize Hep3B
cells sorafenib (Figure 3D), in discrepancy with the results
observed after NOE inhibition, maybe suggesting NOE
off-target effects. Moreover, silencing GCS in PLC cells,
another hepatoma cell line, failed to sensitize to sorafenib
toxicity (Suppl. Fig. 4), and this effect was accompanied
by a modest reduction of GCS protein levels (30-40%).
However, pharmacological inhibition of GCS with PDMP
was highly effective in sensitizing PLC cells to sorafenib
(Suppl. Fig. 5), although it required higher doses of
PDMP compared to other hepatoma cell lines. Overall,
our data suggest that blocking ceramide elimination via
GCS reduction, rather than ACDase, improve sorafenib
cytotoxicity in HCC cells, clearly pointing to GCS as the

sphingolipidic enzyme to pharmacologically target for
sorafenib combined therapy.

GCS inhibition reduced tumor growth in
subcutaneous HCC mouse model after sorafenib
treatment
Before starting in vivo treatments, in order to
replicate the findings of sensitization to sorafenib upon
GCS inhibition/silencing seen with the MTT-based
cell viability approach, crystal violet cell proliferation
assay was used to measure the number of viable cells.
After four days exposure, Hep3B and HepG2 cells
treated with PDMP were clearly sensitized to sorafenib,
diminishing cell survival after GCS inhibition (Figure 4A),
reproducing in clonogenic assays the findings observed
with the MTT assay. After that, we established bilateral

xenograft tumors by injecting subcutaneously HepG2 cells
in the flanks of nude mice. Once measurable tumors were
established, animals received sorafenib or vehicle by oral
gavage, with or without PDMP i.p administration. While
sorafenib-treated mice exhibited reduced tumor growth,
this effect was potentiated by PDMP treatment (Figure
4B). In addition, the sensitizing effect of GCS inhibition
by PDMP was accompanied by reduced tumor cell
proliferation, as denoted by PCNA detection (Figure 4C)
and vascularization, as detected in CD34 stained slides
(Figure 4C). Moreover, we performed TUNEL assay in our

samples to identify DNA fragmentation as consequence of
the apoptotic cell death induced by the chemotherapeutic
treatments (Figure 4C). Only few TUNEL positive cells
were identified after sorafenib treatment, number that
was slightly increased after PDMP co-treatment. In
fact, the percentage of cells detected with fragmented
nuclear DNA is low (under 1%), maybe suggesting that
PDMP/sorafenib combination is not inducing classical
apoptotic cell death. Of note, PDMP alone administration
in mice did not modify tumor growth (Figure 4B), vessel
formation (Figure 4C) or induce any hepatic damage

contrasts with the sharp decline observed for Mcl-1 levels
as soon as 2-4 hours of sorafenib exposure (data not
shown).
Autophagy has a dual role in cancer cells either
promoting survival by providing nutrients to proliferating
cells or triggering cell death via lethal mitophagy [26].
Moreover, GCS inhibitors have been recently described
as enhancers of autophagy flux in primary neurons
[29]. To address whether sorafenib plus PDMP-induced
autophagy is protective or toxic, we incubated sorafenib/
PDMP-treated cells with 3-methyladenine (3-MA),
inhibitor of autophagy initiation. We first tested different
3-MA concentrations to guarantee autophagy inhibition
in the absence of cytotoxicity to hepatoma cells. After
that, 3-MA-induced autophagy inhibition displayed small
protection against sorafenib alone (Figure 5C), while cell
death was clearly potentiated by 3-MA in the combined
treatment (Figure 5D). Therefore, sorafenib/PDMPinduced autophagy induction seems to act as a protective
mechanism, discarding autophagy-induced cell death as
the mechanism triggered during PDMP/sorafenib toxicity.

Effect of GCS inhibition on sorafenib-induced
anti-proliferative effects and autophagy in
hepatoma cells
We next explored potential mechanisms underlying
the potentiation of SOR-induced cell death by GCS
inhibition. Since the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and PI3K/
AKT activity are critical in the progression of HCC [23],
we analyzed the impact of GCS inhibition with PDMP on
these pathways. Following sorafenib exposure, pAKT and
pERK decreased in a dose-dependent manner in Hep3B
cells (Figure 5A). However, no additional changes on
PI3K/AKT and RAF/MAPK/ERK signaling pathway were
detected after GCS inhibition.
Ceramide accumulation [24] and sorafenib
exposure [25] have been reported to promote autophagy.
To determine if enhanced cytotoxic effect of combined
therapy was associated with autophagic cell death, we
treated hepatoma cell line Hep3B with sorafenib and
tracked the conversion of LC3-I to the LC3-II form, as an
autophagosome marker, and p62, which is ubiquitinated
and degraded by the autolysosomes. Sorafenib induced
a reduction in LC3-I that was accompanied by enhanced
degradation of p62, consistent with an increase in
autophagy after the treatment (Figure 5B). LC3-II
accumulation was not evident, probably because LC3II is also degraded by autophagy. The sorafenib/PDMP
treatment resulted in decreased p62 levels compared to
sorafenib alone suggesting that ceramide accumulation by
PDMP potentiates sorafenib-induced autophagy, although
not providing conclusive data. To further analyze this
event, GFP-LC3 expressing Hep3B cells were cultured in
the presence or absence of sorafenib and/or PDMP and the
levels of punctate LC3-positive autophagosomes in cells
were calculated in each condition [26]. As seen, sorafenib
plus PDMP increased the number of LC3 positive dots,
indicating enhanced autophagosome formation (Figure 5E)
as denoted by the quantification of the percentage of cells
with three or more autophagosomal puncta (Figure 5F).
Beclin 1 is a Bcl-2-homology domain 3 (BH3)-only
protein required for the formation of the autophagosome,
and Mcl1 is an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homolog that inhibits
autophagy by “sequestering” Beclin 1 in a dimer [27].
Both proteins have a vital role in autophagy regulation in
HCC cells [28]. Our data showed that sorafenib markedly
decrease Mcl1 levels, and this effect is potentiated by
PDMP (Figure 5B). In fact, Beclin 1/Mcl1 ratio increased
from 1.0 in control cells to 2.8 in PDMP-sorafenib-treated
cells, probably releasing Beclin 1 molecules to promote
autophagy. In addition, we have tested for Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL levels after sorafenib treatment and have found
no differences, at least at short-time incubation, which

GCS inhibition triggers mitochondrialdependent cell death by sorafenib in
hepatoma cells
Besides its involvement in autophagy regulation,
Mcl1 is an antiapoptotic mitochondrial Bcl-2 member,
suggesting that the sensitization of PDMP to sorafenib
could involve apoptotic cell death. Mitochondrial damage
results from sorafenib interaction with mitochondrial
respiratory chain and reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production [30]. Similarly, ceramide induces
mitochondrial permeability after direct interaction with
complex III of the respiratory system [31]. Moreover,
sphingolipids, and particularly ceramide, promote changes
in mitochondrial membrane composition favoring channel
formation by Bcl-2 family members [32, 33]. Therefore,
we evaluated the influence of GCS inhibition on ROS
production and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
after sorafenib treatment. Hep3B cells were treated with
sorafenib and/or PDMP and incubated for 30 minutes
with DCF to determine ROS production and with JC-1
to estimate MMP. Sorafenib induced a rapid decline in
MMP even at low doses, which was not modified by
PDMP addition (Figure 6A). In fact, dissipation of MMP
was complete in less than 30 minutes with sorafenib
doses over 10 μM (not shown here), while PDMP alone
had no affect. In parallel, ROS induction caused by
sorafenib was not potentiated by PDMP, as measured
fluorimetrically by DCF (Figure 6B). In line with these
observations, we addressed whether sorafenib-induced
mitochondrial complex I inactivation, as observed
in human neuroblastoma cells [30] is potentiated by
sorafenib. Complex I activity decreased in sorafenibtreated hepatoma cells (around 50%), but PDMP coaddition did not significantly modify it (Suppl. Fig. 6).

Interestingly, despite the lack of changes in ROS
and MMP by GCS inhibition in sorafenib-treated HCC
cells, combined drug treatment enhanced the release of
cytochrome c into the cytosol (Figure 6C), indicative of
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Of note,
neither sorafenib (1-10 μM) nor PDMP alone up to 6-8
hours exposure induced cytochrome c release, although
sorafenib alone at doses higher than 10 μM triggered
cytochrome c translocation in O/N experiments (not
shown here).
Since mitochondrial cytochrome c release frequently
triggers caspase-dependent cell death through activation
of executor caspases, we measured caspase-3 levels
compared to TNF plus cycloheximide. Sorafenib increased
caspase-3 activity modestly in hepatoma cells, that was
not further enhanced by PDMP addition (Figure 6D),
despite the induction of cytochrome c release and cell
death. Notably, sorafenib/PDMP-induced cell death was
not blocked by pre-incubation with a pan caspase inhibitor
ZVAD (Figure 5D), at doses previously verified to block
Fas-induced apoptosis [17], further suggesting that the
mechanism involved in PDMP sensitization is caspaseindependent.
Elevation of glycolysis and enhanced autophagy may
cooperate to protect cells from caspase independent cell
death [28], preserving viability even after decline of MMP.
Release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins such as

cytochrome c induces a rapid loss of activity in respiratory
complexes jeopardizing mitochondrial functionality, and
leading to bioenergetic crisis and cell death [34]. To test
if GCS inhibition triggers this mechanism, we determined
changes in ATP concentration on sorafenib/PDMP exposed
cells. While neither sorafenib nor GCS inhibition reduced
ATP levels in Hep3B cells, the combination sorafenib/
PDMP depleted ATP levels (Figure 6E), suggesting the
induction of mitochondrial collapse by GCS inhibition
in sorafenib-treated cells. To discard that this effect was
caused by a decline in the number of mitochondria as a
consequence of the treatments, we examined for changes
in the mitochondrial DNA copy number in cells [35].
Despite the mitochondrial dysfunction observed after
6 hours following sorafenib/PDMP administration, no
alteration in mitochondrial DNA amount was detected
indicating that a decrease in mitochondrial mass was not
the reason for the mitochondrial alteration (Suppl. Fig. 7).
Moreover, although most tumors exhibit a
preferential switch to glycolysis, ceramide may reduce
GAPDH expression targeting the “Warburg effect”, as
observed in melanoma cells [36]. However, sorafenib did
not change GAPDH expression regardless of the presence
of PDMP (Suppl. Fig. 8), suggesting a mitochondrial
contribution in the ATP decline caused by the PDMP/
sorafenib cotreatment. Moreover, GCS inhibition
in sorafenib-treated cells caused significant nuclear

condensation (12.7±2.5, 8 hours), detected by Hoechst
staining (Figure 6F), compared to sorafenib (2.3±0.7%)
or PDMP (1.6±0.7%) alone, without evidences of
fragmented nuclei on later times of incubation (data not
shown). Apparently, since executioner caspases require
for full apoptotic death a non-oxidative environment and
an operational ATP production, in sorafenib/PDMP treated
cells, despite cytochrome c release, caspase activation is
blocked forcing the cell to die by a caspase-independent
mechanism after mitochondrial collapse. However, to
better characterize this event a complete bioenergetic
study with a flux analyzer would be required.

sorafenib resistance (Figure 7A-7B). Of note, before MTT
assays, hepatoma cells chronically exposed to sorafenib
were maintained in culture medium without sorafenib
for a week before assays. Moreover, hepatoma resistant
cells displayed almost no reduction in ERK signaling
after sorafenib exposure, in opposition to sensitive cells,
while exhibiting resistance for more than one month
after sorafenib withdrawal and cross-resistance to other
chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin (data
not shown). Afterwards, we checked for alterations in
the sphingolipid metabolism after long-term sorafenib
administration in hepatoma cells. While short-time
sorafenib addition stimulated mRNA changes in several
sphingolipidic enzymes (Table 1), Hep3B cells with
acquired sorafenib resistance exhibited modifications
only in very specific sphingolipidic proteins (Table 2),
most prominently in GCS expression. An effect also
observed in HepG2 resistant cells (Suppl. Table 2). To
validate if GCS expression could play a role in sorafenib
resistance, we reduced GCS levels by RNA interference.

Ceramide-related enzymes were analyzed by RT-PCR in Hep3B cells that exhibit sorafenib resistance after long-term
exposure to sorafenib (Hep3B R) or vehicle (Hep3B S). (n=3). *, p<0.05 vs. control.
Sorafenib-resistant Hep3B cells (Hep3B R cells)
transfected with siRNA against GCS displayed increased
sensitivity upon sorafenib administration (Figure 7C).
Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of GCS with PDMP
was effective in reducing sorafenib resistant in Hep3B R
cells dose-dependently (Suppl. Fig. 9). Similar results were
also observed in HepG2 resistant cells (Suppl. Fig. 10).
To further verify this observation, we overexpressed GCS
in Hep3B cells before exposure to sorafenib (Figure 7D).
GCS-transfected Hep3B cells displayed reduced sorafenibinduced cell death, suggesting that GCS mediates, at least
partially, sorafenib-acquired resistance in hepatoma cells.
Therefore, since our results indicated that GCS
overexpression could contribute to the inefficacy of
sorafenib-therapy, we addressed if enhanced expression of
GCS also occurs in tumors from HCC patients. To do so,
we measured GCS mRNA levels in a human cDNA array
from normal liver tissue or individuals with different HCC
staging. Our results did not detect changes in GCS levels
depending on the HCC stage (Suppl. Fig. 11), probably
indicating a relevant role of GCS in cancer-resistance
rather than in tumor progression or invasiveness.

resistant tumors (Figure 7E-7F). Of note, GCS inhibition
alone did not affect tumor volume (Figure 7F), and did
not cause any detectable liver damage alone or combined
with sorafenib (data not shown). In conclusion, GCS
antagonism restored tumor sensitivity to sorafenib in vivo,
suggesting GCS targeting as an interesting strategy against
sorafenib-acquired resistance.

DISCUSSION
Sorafenib is the only approved systemic drug
recommended for HCC patients with recurrence after
resection/ablation or diagnosed at advanced stages [38,
39]. Although other molecular therapies, tested head-tohead versus sorafenib, are explored in phase III clinical
trials, none of them have achieved superior results [4–6].
Therefore, despite its limitations, sorafenib is so far the
best option for advanced HCC and the first drug able
to disclose a weakness in HCC biology likely due to its
targeting of multiple pathways. Further research is needed
to identify novel molecular targets, but efforts to explore
the efficacy of combination therapies with sorafenib
should not be obviated. In this sense, our data reveals
that ceramide metabolism is activated during sorafenib
administration, making plausible strategies in HCC
treatment aimed to increase cytotoxicity via ceramide
accumulation, by targeting specific ceramide-degrading
enzymes such as GCS. Importantly, GCS is overexpressed
in sorafenib resistant hepatoma cells after long term
exposure, pointing to GCS induction as a specific mediator
of sorafenib resistance that provides a potential target for
cancer therapy.
Most common mutations in HCC, such as p53
and beta-catenin, are undruggable, therefore, suggesting
the need to exploit the use of proteins with well-known
inhibitors such as GCS to improve HCC management.
In this sense, PDMP [40], is a well characterized GCS
inhibitor and has served as a basis of novel GCS inhibitors,

Sorafenib-resistant HepG2 xenografts tumors

inhibition
Enhanced metastatic potential of hepatoma cells
with sorafenib resistance has been previously reported in
an orthotopic HCC model [37]. In our experiments, we
did not detected differences in terms of multiplicity or
engraftment between sorafenib-resistant HepG2 tumors
compared to mice inoculated with parental HepG2 cells.
Once developed, animals were randomly divided in groups
and treated with sorafenib or vehicle in combination with
GCS inhibitor PDMP. Our results verified tumor sorafenib
resistance during the study, while the combined therapy
(PDMP plus sorafenib) significantly reduced the growth of

which are now tested in clinical trials. Particularly,
eliglustat tartrate, a PDMP derivative designed for the
treatment of lysosomal diseases [41], have recently
reached FDA approval for Gaucher’s disease patients
[42]. Obviously, confirmation in preclinical models would
be required, but it is tempting to speculate about positive
results with immediate medical application.
Compounds that potentiates sorafenib efficacy are
important since validate potential targets, and also provide
clues for other products acting in the same metabolic
pathway or in the same subcellular location. In this sense,
our work points to the mitochondria as the organelle
where sorafenib toxicity is triggered by PDMP addition.
Several reports indicate that sorafenib interferes with
the mitochondrial respiratory machinery, inducing loss
of membrane potential and ROS production. However,
our data shows that sorafenib-treated cells maintained
mitochondrial integrity, without any loss of cytochrome
c, and with relatively normal ATP levels for several hours.
In fact, autophagy induction and the capacity of tumor
cells of generating ATP from extra-mitochondrial source
via glycolysis (Warburg effect) are adaptive mechanisms
that allow tumor recovering after strong mitochondrial
damage, sometimes from only a small fraction of surviving
mitochondria [43]. It is conceivable that sorafenib is
acting similarly in the absence of other mitochondrialdamaging stimuli, being insufficient to cause death in
most hepatoma cells. In fact, recent data indicates that the
mitochondrial damage induce by sorafenib is accompanied
by progressive glycolytic reprogramming to help cells
to survive under energetic stress [44]. Regarding this
point, we cannot rule out that GCS inhibition may be
also blocking the glycolytic pathway of ATP generation,
such as observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
treated with nanoliposomal ceramide [36]. However, we
detected no reduction in GADPH activity after PDMP/
sorafenib treatment. In line with these finding, our data
support a pathway in which GCS inhibition leading to
increase ceramide levels targets mitochondria, inducing
cytochrome c release, loss of ATP and energetic collapse,
making hepatoma cells incapable of recovery and destined
to die.
Numerous publications have shown how ceramide
accumulation perturbs the mitochondrial integrity
[13, 16, 14, 31–33], similarly to our observations in
sorafenib-treated hepatoma cells. In particular, changes in
sphingolipid composition of the mitochondrial membranes
seem to alter the specific lipid milieu required for Bak/
Bax activation modifying the cell death induced by BH3only proteins [32, 33]. Therefore, it is plausible that
molecules, such as specific Bcl-2 inhibitors, could elude
the incomplete MMP induced by sorafenib by breaking
the resistance at the point of Bax or Bak activation, as
observed in the PDMP/sorafenib combination. In line
with this, Bcl-xL inactivation (ABT-737) in combination
with sorafenib, that down-regulates Mcl-1 expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

specifically in tumor cells, efficiently induced cell
death in hepatoma cells [45]. In fact, a recent report has
shown in vinorelbine-resistant lung adenocarcinoma
cells an increase in GCS activity which was associated
with induction of Bcl-xL-mediated cell survival [46].
Interestingly, this is not the only link established between
ceramide metabolism and Bcl-2 protection. A recent
publication proposes a feed-forward model by which BAK
activation by chemotherapeutic drugs, and particularly by
BH3 mimetics, leads to elevated ceramide levels resulting
in synergistic channel formation by ceramide metabolites
and BAX/BAK. Certainly, if this mechanism is induced
by the combination of sorafenib and Bcl-2 mimetics is a
point that deserves further investigation [47]. In fact, it
is possible that other mitochondrial interfering molecules
may potentiate sorafenib efficacy maybe due to the
dependence on mitochondrial biogenesis of cancer stem
cells survival [48]. Accordingly, our results point to GCS
targeting as an interesting approach to increase sorafenib
efficacy in HCC management, and support strategies
aiming mitochondria to improve sorafenib therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and conditioned medium
preparation
Human liver tumor cell lines Hep3B, PLC and
HepG2 (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures
(ECACC)) were grown in DMEM (10% FBS) at 37°C
and 5% CO2. To generate sorafenib-resistant hepatoma
cells, freshly thawed Hep3B and HepG2 cells were
cultured with 1 μM of sorafenib and, after a month, the
concentration slowly increased by 0.5 μM per month (up
to 5 μM). After 8 to 10 months, two sorafenib-resistant cell
lines, termed HepG2 R and Hep3B R, were obtained. The
LD50 of the cells to sorafenib was determined in 96-well
plates, routinely for 24 hours and cell viability measured
by MTT assay.

qPCR and Immunoblot analysis
Total DNA isolated with and total RNA with TRIzol
reagent were analyzed with SensiFAST SYBR One-Step
Kit (Bioline. Ecogen, Barcelona, Spain) following the
manufacturer’s instructions, as detailed in Supplemental
Methods. Western blots were performed as indicated in
Supplemental Methods.

RNA interference and GCS overexpression
HepG2 and Hep3B cells were transfected with
siRNAs, designed to knockdown gene expression of
GCS, ACDase or control (siGCS, sc-45404; siACD, sc105032; siCTRL, sc-37007, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies),

FINANCIAL SUPPORT

All animal procedures were performed according
to protocols approved by the Animal Experimentation
Ethics Committee from the University of Barcelona.
For subcutaneous tumor model, male Swiss nude mice,
5-6 week old, were kept under pathogen-free conditions
with free access to standard food and water. HepG2
cells (5×106) or Hep3B cells (2.5×106) were injected
subcutaneously into the flanks of mice in 200 μL DMEM
without FBS, as previously reported [13, 19]. Treatment
with GCS inhibitor 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3morpholino-1-propranol (PDMP) or vehicle (saline
solution) was delivered i.p. daily, while sorafenib was
administered via oral gavage at a dose of 80 μg/g body
weight for 21 days. Tumors were measured periodically
with a vernier caliper, and the volume was calculated as
length×width2×0.5.
