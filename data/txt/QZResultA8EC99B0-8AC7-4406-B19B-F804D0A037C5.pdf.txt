Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Improved sequencing technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for investigating the role of
rare genetic variation in common disease. However, there are considerable challenges with respect
to study design, data analysis and replication1. Here, using pooled next-generation sequencing of
507 genes implicated in the repair of DNA in 1,150 samples, an analytical strategy focussed on
protein truncating variants (PTVs) and a large-scale sequencing case-control replication
experiment in 13,642 individuals, we show that rare PTVs in the p53 inducible protein
phosphatase PPM1D are associated with predisposition to breast cancer and to ovarian cancer.
PPM1D PTV mutations were present in 25/7781 cases vs 1/5861 controls; P=1.12×10−5, which
included 18 mutations in 6,912 individuals with breast cancer; P = 2.42×10−4 and 12 mutations in
1,121 individuals with ovarian cancer; P = 3.10×10−9. Notably, all the identified PPM1D PTVs
were mosaic in lymphocyte DNA and clustered within a 370 bp region in the final exon of the
gene, C-terminal to the phosphatase catalytic domain. Functional studies demonstrated that the
mutations result in enhanced suppression of p53 in response to ionising radiation exposure,
suggesting the mutant alleles encode hyperactive PPM1D isoforms. Thus, although the mutations
cause premature protein truncation, they do not result in the simple loss-of-function typically
associated with this class of variant, but instead likely have a gain-of-function effect. Our results
have implications for the detection and management of breast and ovarian cancer risk. More
generally, these data provide new insights into the role of rare and of mosaic genetic variants in
common conditions, and the utility of sequencing in their identification.

TEXT
There is strong evidence that rare genetic variation is important in breast and ovarian cancer
predisposition2,3. In the 1990s, genome-wide linkage analysis and positional cloning led to
the identification of the DNA repair genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, rare mutations of which
confer substantial risks of both diseases2,3. More recently, through case-control
resequencing studies of candidate genes we, and others, have discovered rare variants that
confer moderate risks of breast and/or ovarian cancer4-10. These cancers are therefore
exemplars of the rare variant-common disease hypothesis.

The successful studies to date have focussed on genes encoding proteins involved in DNA
repair such as PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, BRIP1, RAD51C and RAD51D4-10. These genes are
characterised by multiple, very rare, loss-of-function mutations, usually protein truncating
variants (PTVs), which predispose carriers to breast and/or ovarian cancer4-10. To further
investigate the role of DNA repair genes in cancer susceptibility, we sequenced 507 genes
(the ‘DNA repair panel’) in 1,150 individuals with breast cancer from the UK, 69 of whom
also had ovarian cancer (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). To maximise time,
sample and cost efficiency we used a pooled approach combining 200 ng of DNA from each
of 24 individuals into a single pool which we hybridised to a custom pulldown containing
the DNA repair panel (Supplementary Table 2). We performed sequencing using an Illumina
HiSeq2000 which generated a minimum coverage per pool of 480× for ≥ 90% of the target
region (Supplementary Fig. 2). Sequence variants were called using Syzygy11, the
performance of which was evaluated using previously generated data in a subset of the
samples. The sensitivity of base substitution calling was 99.6% (439/439 common variants
and 24/26 rare variants that were present in 1/24 individuals in a pool). The sensitivity of
insertion/deletion calling was 94.4% (51/54 rare insertion/deletions present in 1/24
individuals in a pool, Supplementary Table 3).
We next considered the 34,564 sequence variants called by Syzygy. We first focussed on
PTVs because of the strong association of this class of mutation with disease. In total, 1,044
PTVs were called by Syzygy and we used a ’PTV prioritisation method’ to stratify the genes

according to the number of different, rare truncating mutations present within the samples12.
PPM1D showed the strongest signal in this analysis, and we confirmed by Sanger
sequencing that five individuals carried different PPM1D PTVs. Two of these individuals
had ovarian cancer in addition to breast cancer.

To further explore the role of PPM1D in breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility we next
performed a case-control Sanger sequencing analysis of PPM1D in a total of 13,642
individuals; 7,781 unrelated individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer and 5,861
population controls (Supplementary Table 1). We initially sequenced all PPM1D exons and
intron-exon boundaries but after completing this analysis in 3,803 samples we noted that all
10 PTV mutations identified occurred within the last exon of PPM1D, and this clustering
was highly significant (P = 8.2×10−6). We thus analysed the remaining 9,839 samples for
this mutation cluster region (MCR), identifying a further 16 PTVs (Supplementary Table 1,
Fig. 1). In total we identified 25 PPM1D PTVs in individuals with breast and/or ovarian
cancer and 1 in controls (P = 1.12×10−5, Fig. 1, Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 4). This
included 18 mutations in 6,912 individuals with breast cancer (P = 2.42×10−4) and 12
mutations in 1,121 individuals with ovarian cancer (P = 3.10×10−9). The histological
features of the cancers in PPM1D mutation carriers were diverse, and five individuals had
both breast and ovarian cancer (Supplementary Table 5). The case series included 773
individuals with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (termed ‘BRCA1/2 mutation carriers’),
four of whom also carried PTVs in PPM1D (4/773 vs 1/5861 controls, P = 8.30×10−4). We
also identified a total of 16 non-synonymous, 14 synonymous and one intronic variant
across the cases and controls; there was no evidence for an association with cancer for these
variant classes (Supplementary Table 6).

The Sanger sequencing chromatograms for the PPM1D PTVs were unusual for
heterozygous mutations as the mutant allele was considerably and consistently lower than
the wildtype allele, suggesting the mutations were mosaic in lymphocyte DNA (Fig. 2a and
Supplementary Fig. 3). This contrasted with the non-truncating variants which all had
normal sequencing profiles. DNA from saliva was available for two individuals and the
PTVs were present at similar amplitude to that identified in the corresponding blood derived
DNA (Supplementary Fig 3). To further confirm the PTV mutations were bona fide we used
two additional mutation detection methods; deep PCR amplicon sequencing13 (Fig. 2b,
Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 4) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification (MLPA)14 (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 7). For the deep
PCR amplicon sequencing we generated Nextera libraries of pooled PCR products covering
BRCA1, BRCA2 and the PPM1D mutation, which we sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq
generating a median coverage of 3387× across the PPM1D mutation (Supplementary Fig. 4
and Supplementary Table 4). This confirmed the PPM1D PTVs were present at a lower
proportion than heterozygous polymorphisms in BRCA1 and BRCA2, with a median mutant
read percentage of 16% (range 5-34%). Additionally, we sequenced the original DNA repair
panel in six cases individually (i.e. unpooled), which again confirmed the mutations were
present, but mosaic (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 4). For three samples
we had data from both the deep PCR amplicon sequencing and the DNA repair panel which
gave identical mutation percentage results (Supplementary Table 4). Finally, family studies
were also consistent with mosaicism; none of 14 relatives carried the PPM1D mutation
identified in the proband. Most compellingly, for each of probands 17 and 24, we identified
two offspring that had inherited different maternal haplotypes at the PPM1D locus, but
neither offspring carried the relevant maternal PPM1D mutation, demonstrating that the
mutations were either not present, or mosaic in the germline of the probands (Fig. 2c).

PPM1D (protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+dependent 1D), also known as WIP1 (Wild-type
p53-induced phosphatase 1) was first identified in a screen for p53 target genes induced by

ionising radiation15. PPM1D encodes a 605 amino acid protein with a N-terminal
phosphatase catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain that contains a putative nuclear
localisation signal (Fig. 1)16. PPM1D transcription is upregulated in response to various
types of DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. Once upregulated, PPM1D has been
shown to dephosphorylate and downregulate several targets, particularly proteins associated
with the ATM/ATR-initiated DNA damage response (DDR) and including tumour
suppressors with a proven role in cancer susceptibility such as p5317, ATM18 and CHK219.
Thus it has been proposed that a primary role of PPM1D is as a homeostatic regulator of the
DDR, facilitating return of cells to their normal state after repair of damaged DNA17. There
is also accumulating evidence that PPM1D is involved in oncogenesis16. PPM1D
amplification and overexpression has been demonstrated in multiple human tumours20,
including breast cancers21 and ovarian clear cell carcinoma22, and is a promising therapeutic
target22-24.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The clustering of PTVs within the 370 bp region corresponding to amino acids 420-546,
which is downstream of the phosphatase catalytic domain but precedes or disrupts the
nuclear localisation signal25, suggests the PTVs are not acting as simple loss-of-function
mutations (Fig. 1). Moreover, all the PTVs were in the last exon and thus predicted to evade
nonsense-mediated RNA decay and to result in a truncated protein that retains the
phosphatase catalytic domain, rather than in haploinsufficiency25,26. We confirmed this
experimentally for three mutations (Fig 2a). To investigate the effect of PPM1D PTVs we
generated cDNA expression constructs representing two mutant alleles (PPM1D c.
1384C>T; case 6 and PPM1D c.1420delC; case 7) and tested their ability to suppress p53
activation in response to ionising radiation (IR) exposure. As expected, the normal elevation
of p53 levels after IR exposure was moderately suppressed in human U2-OS tumour cells
transfected with a wildtype PPM1D expression construct, matching previous
observations16,17 (Fig. 3). The suppression of p53 was enhanced in cells transfected with the
mutant PPM1D expression constructs suggesting that each of these alleles encodes a
hyperactive PPM1D isoform, i.e. consistent with a gain-of-function rather than a loss-offunction effect (Fig. 3). Similar effects were also observed in HeLa and 293 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 7).
To investigate the mechanism of oncogenesis in PPM1D PTV mutation carriers we analysed
eight tumours from five individuals. Intriguingly, the PPM1D mutations were not detectable
in any of the tumours by Sanger sequencing or MLPA (Supplementary Fig. 8). Through
microsatellite analysis we confirmed that the tumours were from the correct individuals and
demonstrated loss of heterozygosity at the PPM1D locus in seven of eight tumours, though
there was no evidence of PPM1D copy number alteration (Supplementary Fig. 8 and
Supplementary Table 8). We microdissected stromal tissue from the ovarian tumour in four
cases and undertook deep sequencing across the PPM1D PTV in blood, tumour and stromal
DNA. Each mutation was present in the blood, at similar level to that detected previously,
absent from the tumour and either absent (two cases) or present at very low level (5/915
reads and 4/5793 reads) in the stroma, consistent with lymphocyte contamination
(Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 5).
These data are intriguing and strongly suggest the mechanism of cancer association in
PPM1D mutation carriers differs from that in carriers of mutations in other DNA repair
genes associated with predisposition to these cancers. There are several potential
explanations. It is possible the mutation was present in the cell of cancer origin but was
subsequently lost, perhaps because a PPM1D mutation can act as a driver to initiate
oncogenesis, but is not required, or is detrimental to the progression of the resulting cancer.
The allele loss we observed at the PPM1D locus could be interpreted as supportive of this
hypothesis, but it should be noted that it is not known if the lost allele carried the PPM1D

PTV, and loss in this region of 17q is common in these cancers. Alternatively, the absence
of the PPM1D mutation in the tumour could be because oncogenesis is being driven by the
mutation in circulating blood cells. Another possibility is that the PPM1D mutations are not
directly involved in causing breast or ovarian cancer. For example, they could be a separate
manifestation of an underlying lesion, perhaps one that causes genomic instability, which
can lead to selection and clonal expansion of cells with PPM1D PTVs and also to cancers in
other tissues. Clearly, further studies will be required to explain the mechanism of
oncogenesis in PPM1D mutation carriers.
Irrespective of the mechanism of the association, our data demonstrate that individuals with
mosaic PPM1D PTVs in the mutation cluster region are at increased risk of cancer. The
association is not explicable by increasing age, unlike recently reported mosaic
chromosomal abnormalities (Supplementary Table 5)27,28. To estimate the cancer risks we
undertook a retrospective cohort analysis using information on breast and ovarian cancer
occurrence in the 6,577 unrelated individuals negative for BRCA1/2 mutations and controls,
by modelling the retrospective likelihood of the observed mutation status conditional on the
disease phenotype, as previously described9,29. This approach adjusts for our ascertainment
of cases with more extreme phenotypes such as young age of onset or bilateral breast cancer,
which we utilise to empower gene discovery4-7,10,30. The relative risk of breast cancer for
PPM1D PTV carriers was estimated to be 2.7 (95% CI: 1.3-5.3; P = 5.38×10−3), which
translates to approximately 23% cumulative risk by age 80. The relative risk of ovarian
cancer was estimated to be 11.5 (95% CI: 4.3-30.4; P = 9.95×10−7), which translates to
approximately 18% cumulative risk by age 80. It is noteworthy that we included an
unselected hospital-based series of 322 ovarian cancer patients in whom we identified five
PPM1D PTVs, suggesting that 1-2% of ovarian cancer patients may harbour mosaic PPM1D
mutations.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The frequency of PPM1D PTVs in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with breast and/or ovarian
cancer was also significantly different from population controls (4/773 vs 1/5861; P =
8.30×10−4) and similar to that in cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer without BRCA1/2
mutations (4/773 vs 21/6634; P = 0.56), suggesting that PPM1D PTVs are also associated
with increased risks of cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Studies of unselected,
population-based cancer patients and of larger series of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers would
be of value to extend our observations, and to further explore the prevalence and cancer
risks associated with PPM1D mutations.
These data provide new insights into ovarian and breast cancer, potentially identifying a
novel class of genetic defect that lies somewhere between classic germline genetic
predisposition mutations and tumour-specific somatic events. It is also highly plausible that
PPM1D mutations are associated with other cancers, and broad evaluation of individuals
with other tumour types would be of interest. More generally, the clinical implications of a
mosaic cancer predisposition marker that is genetic, but not hereditary, and that is detectable
in the blood but not the tumour(s) it is associated with are rather profound, particularly if
this phenomenon is observed in other genes/contexts.
Our results also provide insights into genetic variation, particularly in relation to the nature
and impact of rare gene mutations associated with disease. Given the truncating mutations
we report likely have a gain-of-function effect, the widespread interchangeable use of the
terms ‘truncating mutation’ and ‘loss-of-function mutation’ is inappropriate. We believe a
more descriptive term such as ‘protein truncating variant’ (PTV), which does not imply the
functional consequence of the mutation, is preferable. We also provide evidence that mosaic
mutations can have relevance to common disease. Such variants are challenging to detect by
Sanger sequencing, but are detectable by next-generation sequencing approaches. It is

therefore likely that further examples of mosaic disease-associated mutations will be
forthcoming, though studies to define the frequency and characteristics of mosaic mutations
in control individuals will be essential, to ensure the implications of such variants in case
series are correctly interpreted. Finally, although newer sequencing technologies are making
large-scale whole-genome sequencing experiments ever more feasible, it is likely that
focussed sequencing experiments with tailored design and analytical prioritisation strategies,
such as those employed here, will have utility over the next few years.

ONLINE METHODS
Patients and Samples
Cases—We used lymphocyte DNA from 8,046 individuals affected with breast and/or
ovarian cancer that were recruited via two studies. 7,724 cases were recruited through 24
genetics centres in the UK via the Breast and Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility study (BOCS),
which recruits women ≥18 years who have had breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer and have
a family history of breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer. Each proband was screened for
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (by Sanger sequencing and/or heteroduplex analysis) and
large rearrangements (by MLPA). The remaining 322 cases are an unselected hospital-based
series of women with ovarian cancer who were recruited during treatment for ovarian cancer
at the Royal Marsden Hospital. The DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples
except in 11 cases, for whom DNA was extracted from a lymphoblastoid cell line (NB all
the PPM1D mutations were identified in peripheral blood-derived DNA). At least 97% of
families were of European ancestry, i.e. comparable to the controls. Informed consent was
obtained from all participants. The research was approved by the London Multicentre
Research Ethics Committee (MREC/01/2/18).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For the Phase 1 pooled DNA repair panel experiment we used lymphocyte DNA from 1,150
women with breast cancer, 69 also had ovarian cancer. 78 of these individuals had one
mutation, and one individual had two mutations, in known cancer predisposition genes.
These were included as ‘positive controls’ to evaluate variant calling (see below). For the
PPM1D case-control sequencing experiment we used 7,781 individuals with breast and/or
ovarian cancer. We did not use the case data from the pooled DNA repair panel experiment
in the case-control analysis, firstly because the mutation status of individuals cannot be
definitively obtained from the pooled experiment as one cannot be certain that every sample
is equally represented in a pool, and secondly because the mutation detection method was
different to that utilised in the case-control experiment. We used our standard case and
control sample trays for the case-control PPM1D sequencing experiment and the sample
selection was blind to the pooled DNA repair panel experiment. 885 individuals were part of
both experiments.
Samples and pathology information from mutation-positive families—For
families in which a PPM1D mutation was detected, we sought DNA samples from relatives.
We also requested tumour material, histopathology information, and immunohistochemical
profiles, including hormone receptor receptor and HER2 status for patients with breast
cancer, in probands from the hospitals where they had been treated. Representative tumour
blocks were retrieved where possible and examined by two histopathologists (DNR & JSRF) and classified and graded according to the World Health Organisation 2003
classification1,2. Tumours were microdissected under a stereomicroscope and genomic DNA
was extracted from tumour and, where possible, stroma using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen) as
previously described2.

Controls—We used lymphocyte DNA from 5,861 population-based controls obtained from
the 1958 Birth Cohort Collection, an ongoing follow-up of persons born in Great Britain in
one week in 1958. Biomedical assessment was undertaken during 2002-2004 at which blood
samples and informed consent were obtained for creation of a genetic resource but
phenotype data for these individuals is not available. At least 97% of the controls were of
European ancestry. (http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/studies.asp?section=000100020003).

DNA repair panel sequencing—We identified genes for inclusion on the DNA repair
panel from http://www.geneontology.org/ using the search term “DNA repair” (GO:
0006281) and from http://string-db.org/ by identifying all genes interacting with ATM,
BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2 and PALB2 with highest confidence (≥ 0.9). This dataset
was manually curated to remove duplicate genes and pseudogenes. CCDS transcripts for the
remaining genes were retrieved from UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/
from November 2010) (Supplementary Table 2). Genomic coordinates for all coding exons
were identified and targeted in a custom pulldown designed using the Agilent SureSelect
Target Enrichment system (Agilent)3. We created 48 pools of DNA that each included 4 μl
of 50 ng/μl = 200ng of DNA from 24 individuals. We sheared 80 μl of the pooled DNA
using Covaris technology. We prepared libraries without gel size selection or PCR
enrichment using the Illumina Genomic PE Sample Prep Kit (Ilumina) and performed target
enrichment according to the Agilent SureSelect protocol. Sequencing was performed by the
WTCHG High-throughput DNA sequencing and MRC hub in Oxford on an Illumina
HiSeq2000 (v2 flow cell, one lane of sequencing per pool) generating 2×100 bp reads.
Sequence reads for each pool were mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using
BWA (version 0.5.6)4. Mapped reads were filtered to remove ambiguous alignments with a
quality score of 0 and bases with a call quality below 22 were masked. Of the remaining
reads for each pool 50-60% fell within the target regions, except for Pool 21 where the on
target percentage was significantly lower. Median coverage for each pool achieved for target
regions after filtering was between 2849× and 5545×. This corresponded to an average
coverage of 119×-231× per sample. All pools had 90% of the target covered at a minimum
of 480x. Target regions within the MHC achieved substantially lower coverage and were
excluded from further analysis.
We also sequenced the DNA repair panel in six PPM1D PTV positive individuals using
Illumina TruSeq kits for library preparation to enable sample indexing. Genomic DNA (1.5
μg) was fragmented and the libraries prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Sample
Preparation Kit (index set A). One pool of six libraries (500 ng each) was enriched as before
but with the addition of extra blocking primers targeted against the TruSeq index adapter
sequences. Sequencing was performed at ICR with an Illumina HiSeq2000 (v3 flowcell, one
lane) generating 2×100 bp reads. Mapped reads were filtered to remove ambiguous
alignments with a quality score of 0 and bases with a call quality below 22 were masked. Of
the remaining reads, 41-43% fell within the target region for each individual. Median
coverage of the target for each individual after filtering was between 602x and 690×. All
individuals had 90% of the target covered at a minimum of 50×.
PPM1D Sanger sequencing—We designed primers to PCR amplify and Sanger
sequence PPM1D using Exon-Primer from UCSC Genome Browser (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/ from November 2010). Primers and conditions are available on request.
PCR reactions were performed using the QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen). Amplicons
were unidirectionally sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an
ABI3730 automated sequencer (ABI PerkinElmer). We analysed the full coding sequence in
2,456 cases and 1,347 controls. As all the mutations identified in these samples were

restricted to exon 6 we sequenced the mutation cluster region (c.1261-20-c.1695), but not
the rest of the gene, in the remaining 5,325 cases and 4,514 controls. We also sequenced the
mutation cluster region in all available samples from relatives of PPM1D PTV positive
probands. All sequencing traces were independently analyzed by two individuals who were
blind to the others analysis. Each individual analysed the sequencing with both automated
software (Mutation Surveyor, SoftGenetics) and manual visual inspection. All putative
mutations were confirmed by bidirectional sequencing from a fresh aliquot of the stock
DNA. We also undertook Sanger sequencing of the PPM1D cluster region, in triplicate, in
DNA from eight tumour samples and four ovarian stromal samples.
For the cDNA sequencing we established lymphoblastoid cell lines from three individuals
with PPM1D PTVs (cases 20, 23 and 24). RNA was extracted using RNeasy Minikit
(Qiagen) and cDNA synthesised using the ThermoScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen),
employing standard protocols. We amplified the mutation cluster region using a cDNAspecific primer, [Forward_ACCACCAGTCAAGTCACTGG;
Reverse_TCTTTCGCTGTGAGGTTGTG] which we sequenced as described above.
Deep PCR amplicon sequencing—In lymphocyte DNA we amplified the PPM1D
mutation cluster region and the full coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries of BRCA1
and BRCA2 using the Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen). We prepared indexed libraries of the
PCR products using Nextera technology (Ilumina)5. We created two pools of 24 indexed
libraries which we sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq, generating 2×150 bp reads. Data
from 20 individuals passed quality control coverage metrics, generating median coverage
greater than 500× across the PPM1D cluster region (average median coverage 3384×).

For the tumour analyses we amplified the mutation cluster region in tumour, stroma and
blood DNA using an Illumina Nextera XT library preparation kit and supplied protocol
(Illumina). To attain the required 1ng input for tagmentation we also amplified BRCA1 in
24 samples as described above and we then created one pool of 24 indexed libraries which
we sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq, generating 2×150bp reads. We visually inspected
all sequencing reads present at the mutation site after alignment with Stampy to determine if
the PPM1D mutation was present.
NGS data analysis
DNA repair panel data—For the pooled DNA repair panel analysis, variant calling was
undertaken with Syzygy (version 1.2.4)6. 402/439 previously validated SNPs with a
MAF>5% genotyped through a breast cancer GWAS7 were successfully identified with high
confidence and the remaining 37 SNPs were detected at lower confidence. Syzygy also
detected 75/80 rare variants (MAF<1%) included in the study as positive controls (24/26
base substitutions, 14/14 insertions, 30/32 deletions and 7/8 complex indels, Supplementary
Table 3). Thus sensitivity was 99.6% for base substitutions and 94.4% for rare indels.
Frequency estimation for rare variants was assessed by evaluation of 39 BRCA1 and
BRCA2 variants at a frequency of one per pool. Syzygy correctly estimated the frequency in
33 of the 35 variants it detected, incorrectly estimating the frequency at two per pool for the
remaining two variants.
Deep PCR amplicon sequencing data—For the deep PCR amplicon sequencing and
the indexed DNA repair panel sequencing in six individuals, sequence reads were mapped to
the human reference genome (hg19) using Stampy version 1.0.148. Duplicate reads were
flagged using Picard version 1.60 (http://picard.sourceforge.net). Variant calling was
performed with Platypus version 0.1.9 (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/platypus)9. The mutant

read percentage was calculated as the proportion of total reads at the variant location that
contained the variant, with a minimum mutant read percentage threshold of 5%.

Variant Annotation—Annotation for all experiments was undertaken with reference to
CCDS transcripts from EnsEMBL version 65 identified using a custom Perl script
(Supplementary Table 2). Variant calls were annotated for changes with respect to the
chosen transcript and assigned a consequence type from the list used by EnsEMBL.
PTV Prioritisation Method—This is a gene-based (rather than the more typical variantbased) strategy that aims to prioritise potential disease-associated genes for follow-up by
leveraging two properties of protein truncating variants: (1) the strong association of rare
truncating variants with disease, and (2) collapsibility; different PTVs within a gene
typically result in the same functional effect and can be combined equally. We implemented
the method using the stats package in R. We first outputted all the predicted protein
truncating variants: stop gains, coding frameshifts and essential splice site variants (−2, −1,
+1, +2, +5). For this experiment we defined ‘rare’ as PTVs that were seen only once in the
DNA repair panel data. We next stratified the genes according to the number of different,
rare singleton PTVs called. We excluded genes for which samples had been included as
positive controls (Supplementary Table 3). PPM1D was the top gene in this analysis. We are
undertaking further analyses and follow-up of the DNA repair panel data which we aspire to
present in a separate publication.
MLPA

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We designed 22 probe pairs targeting PPM1D PTVs (n=18), wildtype PPM1D (n=2),
wildtype BRCA1 (n=1) and wildtype CEP112 (n=1) (Supplementary Table 7). We added
the synthetic probes to the SALSA MLPA probe mix P200 (MRC Holland). MLPA
reactions were performed in triplicate according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MLPA
was undertaken in lymphocyte DNA from 17 probands and in eight tumour DNA samples
(from five individuals). In brief, probes were hybridised to 150 ng of denatured DNA,
amplified by PCR, and separated on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Data were analysed using GeneMarker v1.51 software (SoftGenetics).
Microsatellite analysis
We used 5′6-FAM tagged primer pairs and PCR conditions for 17q microsatellite analysis
as listed in Supplementary Table 8. 10 μl of a mastermix of 30 μl ROX size standard and
1ml HiDi formamide were added to each reaction post PCR, denatured at 95°C for 5
minutes, and cooled at −20°C for 5 minutes. Reactions were run on a 3730xL genetic
analyser (Applied Biosystems) under the fragment analysis protocol. Data were analysed
using GeneMarker v1.51 software (SoftGenetics). Microsatellite analysis was undertaken in
lymphocyte DNA from 13 individuals from eight families, and in eight tumour DNA
samples and four stroma DNA samples from five individuals. Of note, one of these cases
(17) harbours both BRCA1 and PPM1D mutations. Both genes are located at chromosome
17q and it is the wild-type BRCA1 allele that is reduced in the tumours and therefore the
relevance of the loss of heterozygosity with respect to PPM1D is difficult to deduce.
Cell line and plasmid constructs
The U2OS, HeLa and HEK293 (all p53 wildtype) cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured and maintained according
to the supplier’s instructions. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen). A plasmid containing full-length wildtype PPM1D cDNA (pCMV6
entry-PPM1D) was obtained from Origene, and the PPM1D open reading frame (ORF)

subcloned into pCMV6-AN-HA (Origene), generating a construct that could express a
PPM1D-N-terminal HA epitope fusion protein. Truncating mutations were introduced into
the PPM1D ORF of this construct using the QuickChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Kit (Stratagene). To generate the following mutants, we used the following DNA
amplification primers:

reverse primer GACTACACCTTAGACATTCTCTC,

forward primer GATCCAGAACCATTGAAG,
reverse primer CTTCAATGGTTCTGGATC.
Western Blot Analysis of P53 levels
U2OS, HeLa and HEK293 cells were transfected with PPM1D expression constructs and 24
hours after transfection, cells were exposed to gamma irradiation (5 Gy) from an X ray
source. Whole cell lysates were generated from transfected cells after irradiation (at 30
minute and four hour time points) and subjected to protein electrophoresis. Immunoblotting
of electrophoresed lysates was performed using antibodies specific for p53 (9282S - Cell
Signaling Technology) and actin (sc-1616, Santa Cruz Biotech).
Frequency and Risk Estimation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Statistical analyses were performed using the stats package in R. The significance of
mutation clustering was modelled under a binomial distribution where the probability of
observing a mutation in the last exon, which comprises 31% of the coding sequence, was
0.31. The frequency in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers and non-carriers was compared using a
two-sided test of proportions. Risk estimation was implemented using a competing risks
retrospective likelihood model incorporating age at onset according to a proportional
hazards model. Since individuals screened for PPM1D mutations were selected on the basis
of both personal and family history of breast or ovarian cancer, standard methods of analysis
that ignore the sampling frame would yield biased estimates of the risk ratios. To address
this, we analysed data within a retrospective cohort approach by modelling the conditional
likelihood of the observed genotypes given the disease phenotypes, using information on
breast and ovarian cancer occurrence in the set of 6,577 unrelated individuals negative for
BRCA1/2 mutations (BRCA1/2 mutation-positive individuals from the BOCS series and all
the unselected ovarian case series were excluded) and controls. Male controls were included
in the analysis, but were not considered to be at risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer.
We assumed a competing risks model, under which, each individual was at risk of
developing breast or ovarian cancer. This has been shown to provide unbiased estimates of
the risk ratios for breast and ovarian cancer where a genetic variant may be associated with
one or both of the diseases10. We estimated the PPM1D mutation carrier frequency in the
population and breast and ovarian cancer risk ratios simultaneously. Since mutation
screened probands may have been selected on the basis of bilateral breast cancer diagnosis
or on the basis of both breast and ovarian cancer diagnosis we allowed for the risks of breast
or ovarian cancer diagnosis after the first cancer diagnosis, including the risk of contralateral
breast cancer. This model assumes that the increased breast cancer (including contralateral)
or ovarian cancer risk after the first cancer diagnosis is entirely due to the susceptibility as
defined by the model, with no additional variation in risk. Site-specific cancer risks were

assumed to be independent conditional on genotype. Therefore the incidence of cancer at the
second site was assumed to be the same as if the preceding cancer had not occurred, with the
exception of contralateral breast cancer incidence after the first breast cancer, which was
assumed to be half the overall breast cancer incidence, since only one breast was at risk. In
all models females were censored at age 80 years. We assumed that the breast and ovarian
cancer incidences depend on the underlying PPM1D genotype through models of the form:
λ(t) = λ0(t)exp(βx)where λ0(t) is the baseline incidence at age t in non-mutation carriers, β
is the log risk ratio associated with the mutation and x takes value 0 for non-mutation
carriers and 1 for mutation carriers. The overall breast and ovarian cancer incidences, over
all genotypes, were constrained to agree with the population incidences for England and
Wales in the period of 1993-199711, as described previously12.13. The models were
parameterised in terms of the mutation frequencies and log-risk ratios for breast and ovarian
cancer. Parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation and were
implemented in the pedigree analysis software MENDEL14. The variances of the parameters
were obtained by inverting the observed information matrix. To obtain confidence intervals
for the risk ratios and perform hypothesis testing, log risk ratios were assumed to be
normally distributed. A Wald test-statistic was used to test the null hypothesis that β=0 for
both breast and ovarian cancer. Since PPM1D mutations were not found to segregate within
families, we did not take into account precise family histories or pedigree information and
therefore did not incorporate the effects of other susceptibility genes.
