ABSTRACT
HGF/MET pathway mediates cancer initiation and development. Thus, inhibition
on HGF-initiated MET signaling pathway would provide a new approach to cancer
targeted therapeutics. In our study, we identified a targeting peptide candidate
binding to HGF which was named HGF binding peptide-1 (HGP-1) via bacterial surface
display methods coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). HGP-1
showed the moderate affinity when determined with surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) technique and high specificity in binding to HGF while assessed by fluorescencebased ELISA assay. The results from MTT and in vitro migration assay indicated that
HGF-dependent cell proliferation and migration could be inhibited by HGP-1. In vivo
administration of HGP-1 led to an effective inhibitory effect on tumor growth in A549
tumor xenograft models. Moreover, findings from Western Blots revealed that HGP-1
could down-regulated the phosphorylation levels of MET and ERK1/2 initiated by
HGF, which suggested that HGP-1 could disrupt the activation of HGF/MET signaling
to influence the cell activity. All the data highlighted the potential of HGP-1 to be a
potent inhibitor for HGF/MET signaling.

HGF in breast cancer is related to its progression [11].
Moreover, the expression level of HGF in the tumor
tissue is a crucial index for prognosis evaluation in some
cases such as glioma, due to its higher concentration in
malignant glioma than adenomas, oligodendrogliomas
and normal brain tissues [12]. Therefore, development
of agents targeting to components in HGF/MET pathway
is a potential therapeutic strategy for many cancers.
In recent years, many HGF/MET-related targeting
inhibitors or competitors are on the way to pre-clinical
or clinical evaluation. Various HGF targeting agents
including HGF antibodies and bio-antagonists are
reported. NK4 [13], a well-known HGF antagonist, is
a potent competitor that disrupts HGF binding to MET.
Ficlatuzumab [8, 14, 15] is one of HGF antibodies
undergoing clinical evaluation. Antibodies targeting
MET, including single-armed humanized monovalent
antibodies such as onartuzumab, are under phase II clinical
evaluation [1]. A novel targeting protein, anticalin PRS110 is an effective MET targeting agents [16]. In addition,

INTRODUCTION
The c-mesenchymal-epithelia transform factor
(c-MET, also called MET) was first discovered in the
1980s as an activated oncogene [1], and hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) was the sole physiological ligand
of MET [2]. The binding activity of HGF to MET
activates downstream signaling pathway, which regulates
cell mitogenesis, motogenesis, angiogenesis and
morphogenesis [3, 4]. The dysregulation of HGF/MET
pathway has been implicated in many kinds of cancers
[5–7]. MET is frequently involved in the pathogenesis of
solid tumors. For example, MET receptor overexpression
is often observed in gastric carcinoma, medulloblastoma,
glioblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer [1, 8, 9].
MET mutation is another MET-related dysregulation that
exists in colorectal cancer [1]. Meanwhile, the disorders
of HGF also play important roles in tumors progression.
HGF autocrine and overexpression are inducers of
angiogenesis in brain cancer [1, 8, 10]. The mutation of

small-molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are other
important parts of MET targeting agents. Some of TKIs
have been evaluated in pre-clinical models. Among them,
PHA665752 and SU11274 from Pfizer are the typical
representatives [1, 8].
Although the existing MET or HGF targeting
agents including TKIs and antibodies exhibit effective
inhibition on MET signaling [17], they have some
deficiencies in clinical application. For instance,
antibodies with large molecular weight will lead
to relatively low tissue penetrability. In addition,
antibodies have the potential to cause receptor
dimerization without ligands due to their bivalent
structure of immunoglobulins [8], which may create
potential risk in clinical targeting therapeutics. As
for TKIs, their broaden spectrum of inhibition on
tyrosine kinases may result in serious side effects
[16]. Furthermore, the acquired resistance in MET
targeted therapy initiated by TKIs [18] would limit their
application in targeting therapy as well.
Targeting peptides, biomolecules with lower molecular
weight and good tissue penetration, emerge as an attractive
class of therapeutic agents. In 1992, there existed reports on
peptides application in lymphoma therapy [19]. Benefiting
from bacterial surface display, we obtained a series of HGF
targeting peptides. By assessing the in vitro physicochemical
activities and in vivo bioactivities, a HGF targeting peptide
was selected to be a potential inhibitor candidate for HGF/
MET signaling pathway.

The peptides displayed on the surface of bacteria
clone 1, 2 and 3 were named HGF binding peptide-1, 2 and
3 (HGP-1, 2 and 3) separately. Peptide physicochemical
properties were preliminarily analyzed with bacteria
clones. To evaluate the binding ability of peptides on the
surface of bacteria to HGF, the PE-A fluorescence intensity
of each clone with different wash procedures were
determined by flow cytometry. Bacteria clones undergoing
regular or stringent washing procedures after incubation
with HGF were prepared. Results from flow cytometry
showed that HGP-1 and HGP-3 in washed groups bound
to their targets as well as the regular ones, but HGP-2 in
washed group had an obvious reduction (Supplementary
Figure S2a). These data indicated that HGP-1 and HGP3 had higher binding capability to HGF compared with
HGP-2 when displayed on the surface of bacteria.
To evaluate binding specificity of peptide displayed
on the surface of bacteria, cytokines including VEGF, EGF,
bFGF and BSA were added separately into the incubation
system. All samples were prepared referring to procedure
in sorting and their PE-A fluorescence intensities were
measured by flow cytometry. These proteins or cytokines,
except for EGF, did not disrupt bacteria clones binding
with HGF (Supplementary Figure S2b).

RESULTS

In order to gain an insight into the binding capability
of bacteria-free HGF binding peptides, the peptides
were synthesized and their binding properties were
determined. Moreover, a scrambled peptide of HGP-1
(SP-H1) was designed as described previously [20, 21].
To verify that SP-H1 could not bind to HGF, increasing
concentrations of SP-H1 were incubated with HGF
coated on the plate. Results from the fluorescence-based
ELISA assay demonstrated that SP-H1 remained a low
binding level to HGF at a high concentration (100 μM)
(Supplementary Figure S3a). It indicated that SP-H1 could
be an appropriate control in the study.
Since HGP-1 and HGP-2 showed different binding
capability on the surface of bacteria, we decided to
examine the binding properties of these two peptides. To
pre-assess the binding ability of peptide to HGF, peptides
were coated on the fluorescence plates and incubated with
HGF. The well coated with HGP-1 had at least 1500 times
higher RFU than the one with SP-H1. HGP-2 had a weaker
binding with HGF, but still with 700 times much higher
RFU than SP-H1 when coated on the well (Supplementary
Figure S3b). In other words, HGP-1 performed a twice
much stronger binding capability to HGF than HGP2, which was in accordance with results from relative
bacteria clones. In order to obtain a precise affinity data

Identification of binding peptides for HGF from
a fully random bacteria display library
To identify the peptide sequences binding to HGF,
a fully random 15-mer bacteria peptide library (X15) was
used. A schematic illustration for fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) was shown (Figure 1). In order to screen
the HGF binding peptides effectively and reduce the library
size rapidly, the original library was sorted by one cycle
of magnetic cell sorting (MACS). Through MACS and 7
cycles of FACS, percentages of bacteria in the sorting gate
increased from 2.3% to 50.5% (Supplementary Figure S1),
and PE-A fluorescence intensity of whole population in
each cycle ascended from 33 to 851 (Figure 2a). In addition,
to obtain peptides with higher affinity and specificity to
HGF, the incubation concentration of HGF was decreased
coupling with adding 10% human serum into the mixture
in the following generations of sorting. After next 6 cycles
of screening, there was a significant increase in the mean
intensity of PE-A fluorescence of enriched libraries (Figure
2b and 2c). Totally 52 bacteria clones were selected for
sequencing and 18 different peptide sequences were
obtained (Table 1). No obvious consensus sequence was
identified.

of HGP-1, the affinity and kinetics of HGP-1 against
HGF was detected by SPR technique (Figure 3a). HGF
was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 chip. Then, the
active groups were inactive by ethanolamine. Different
concentrations of HGP-1 were injected over the surface of
the chip followed by dissociation in buffer without peptide.
The KD value of HGP-1 was 1.73 × 10-6 M (697.5 1/Ms for
ka and 0.001243 1/s for kb).
The binding specificity of HGP-1 was investigated
by a fluorescence-based ELISA assay. HGF was coated
on the plate as the solid phase, and 10 μM FITC-labeled

HGP-1 coupling with different concentrations of cytokines
(EGF, VEGF, bFGF) and BSA acted as liquid phase. The
proteins except HGF did not obviously disrupt the binding
of HGP-1 to immobilized HGF (Figure 3b). Although
HGP-1 displayed on bacteria surface showed a high
binding activity with EGF (Supplementary Figure S2b),
the data from fluorescence-based direct ELISA gave an
opposite result. Even at a high concentration (100 μM),
HGP-1 did not exhibited a binding level to EGF as high
as to HGF. The RFU readouts of the wells coated with
EGF were approximately 8 times lower than the ones with

HGF targeting peptides inhibited HGFdependent cell proliferation

HGF post HGP-1 incubation (Figure 3c). Furthermore,
MTT assay was used for the detection of HGP-1 influence
on EGF-dependent cell proliferation to further evaluate
the binding capability of HGP-1 to EGF. In this assay,
A549 cells were used, on which EGFR is over-expressed.
The MTT results illustrated that HGP-1 performed
no significant inhibition on the EGF-dependent cell
proliferation (Supplementary Figure S4), which indicated
that HGP-1 might not bind to EGF or at least not bind to
the receptor-binding site of EGF.

The HGF/MET axis has been implicated in cell
proliferation [3]. Thus, we would like to assess the HGP-1
inhibition on cell proliferation initiated by HGF via
MTT assay and Ki-67 expression evaluation. After 4
days of HGP-1 treatment, the results from MTT assay
demonstrated that A549 cells treated with HGP-1 had
10% to 25% reduction in proliferation at the range of

(n = 5). c. The binding activity between HGP-1 to HGF and EGF were measured by fluorescence-based direct ELISA assay post 1.5-hour
incubation. HGP-1 at the concentrations of 0.1 μM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM were used (n = 3). Values were mean ± SEM.

HGP-1 concentrations (61.5 nM to 3.075 μM) as shown
in Figure 4a. It was further validated that HGP-1 could
inhibit A549 cells proliferation with an IC50 value of
496.4 μM (Figure 4b). As a supplement, another HGF
targeting peptide HGP-2 had a similar inhibitory effect
on cell proliferation in A549 cells although its binding
capability to HGF was lower than HGP-1 (Supplementary
Figure S5). Moreover, HGP-1 and HGP-2 did not exhibit
detectable cytotoxicity to cell proliferation in HGF-free
environment (Supplementary Figure S6a and S6b).
Ki-67 is a nucleoprotein whose expression is
associated with cell proliferation. Ki-67 expression levels
in A549 cells after treated with peptides were determined
by flow cytometry. The results illustrated that Ki-67
expression of A549 cells had a 74% decline when treated
with 1 μM HGP-1 for 2 days. In contrast, 1 μM SP-H1 did
not show obvious inhibitory effect on Ki-67 expression
compared with HGP-1 group (Figure 4c and 4d).

healing assay showed that HGP-1 performed a potent
inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-435s cell migration,
and the inhibition displayed decrease trend with
treatment by increasing concentration of peptides
(Figure 4e and Supplementary Figure S7a). HGP-2
also displayed a similar effect on MDA-MB-435s
(Supplementary Figure S7a and Supplementary Figure
S7b). Besides, no obvious inhibitory effect of HGP-1 and
HGP-2 on MDA-MB-435s migration was detected in the
culture system without HGF (Supplementary Figure S8).
The cell movement from one side of transwell
membrane to the basal side could mimic cell vertical motility.
To further validate the migration inhibitory effect of HGP-1 on
MDA-MB-435s, a transwell migration assay was conducted.
As shown in Figure 4f and 4g, after 18-hour treatment, the
number of migrated cells in HGP-1 group had almost 50%
reduction comparing with cells treated by HGF alone.
Label-free real-time cell-based assay (RTCA) could
provide cell dynamic data. Therefore, it was used to
examine the time-dependent effect of HGP-1 on A549 cell
motility [25]. A549 cells were treated by HGF alone or
coupling with 100 μM peptide (HGP-1 or SP-H1) to assess
temporal inhibitory effect of HGP-1 on cell migration.
When compared with SP-H1 treatment, 100 μM HGP-1
reduced the cell index by 40% at the 20th hour (Figure 4h),
which meant that HGP-1 could inhibit the migration of
A549 cells induced by HGF effectively. In addition, we
noticed that inhibitory effect of HGP-1 on cell migration
started approximately 14 hours post treatment.

MDA-MB-435s cells were used referring to the

HGP-1 inhibited tumor growth in luciferaseexpressed A549 xenograft models

Furthermore, RTCA was used to evaluate
whether inhibitory effect of HGP-1 on cell migration
was concentration-dependent. The result demonstrated
that HGP-1 at the concentration of 10 μM and 100 μM
established inhibitory effect on cell migration (Figure 4i)
in a concentration-dependent manner. In RTCA, HGP-1
exhibited a temporal and concentration-dependent
inhibitory effect on A549 cell migration.

transplantation. Results showed that the early HGP-1
treatment would postpone the initiation of tumors and
retard the tumor growth (Figure 5a). Data from the ROI
analysis of tumor bioluminescence signals displayed
the same trend with those from vernier calipers on the
assessment of tumor volume alteration (Figure 5b, 5c).
The average volume of tumor in day 74 of HGP-1 group
exhibited a 77% reduction compared with SP-H1 group
in the bioluminescence analysis, in accordance with data
from vernier calipers (Figure 5d, 5e). No significant
inhibitory effect of HGP-1 on tumor metastasis was
observed (Data not shown).

In 2009, Eric M. and colleagues reported a HGF-β
targeting peptide that could work as a noncompetitive
inhibitor for MET signaling [24]. In our study, we also
presented a peptide candidate HGP-1 for HGF/MET
signaling inhibition. HGP-1 could target to the full length
HGF with KD of 1.73 μM, lower than the disulfideconstrained HGF-β targeting peptide of HB1 (3 μM) in the
first panning. In addition, although HGF-β associated with
the activation of MET, but the activation of MET need a
cooperative interaction between α- and β-chain of HGF
[29, 30]. That is the reason why we choose the full length
HGF to be the targeting protein in our screening.
In order to study the mechanisms of inhibitory
effect of HGP-1 in vitro and in vivo, phosphorylation level
of MET and its downstream components were detected.
Results from Western Blot illustrated that HGP-1
could inhibit phosphorylation of MET at Y1234/1235,
which provided a possible explanation for alteration of
cell activities induced by HGP-1. According to the report
from Roskoski and Trusolino et al., phospho-MET would
lead to the activation of Ras-ERK cascade in HGF/MET
signaling and ERK1/2 involved in the regulation of cell
proliferation [27, 31]. In our study, HGP-1 inhibited the
phospho-ERK1/2 level at T202/Y204, which indicated
that ERK1/2 may be one of the mediators for HGP-1
to affect cell proliferation. As an important downstream
protein, ERK1/2 could activate myosin light chain kinase
to manipulate cell motility [32], which indicated that
ERK1/2 could be involved in HGP-1 inhibitory effect
on cell migration initiated by HGF. Belonging to ERK
family, ERK2 performed a dominant role in governing
cell proliferation and migration [33]. In this study, 50
μM HGP-1 inhibited phospho-ERK2 level at a similar
extent to 5 μM HGP-1 (Supplementary Figure S9b),
which meant that increased HGP-1 concentration was not
a main factor that cause the drop of phospho-ERK2 level.
The inhibition of HGP-1 on phospho-ERK2 might be a
possible explanation for the decline of A549 migration
when treated by 10 μM HGP-1 in RTCA. However,
some other molecules might be involved in the decrease
of A549 migration induced by 100 μM HGP-1, because
50 μM HGP-1 did not induce more significant downregulation of phospho-ERK2 level compared with 5 μM
HGP-1. It could be explained that there may exist other
downstream signaling components in HGF/MET signaling
and other possible receptors or lateral signaling pathways
such as EGFR pathway [34] involved in the inhibitory
effect of HGP-1.
In our study, ROI analysis of bioluminescence
signal and vernier calipers measurement were applied to
measure tumor volumes. The data from bioluminescence
provided more objective assessment on tumor volumes,
which would be a better approach to observe the tumor
growth. The bioluminescence signal did not provide
evidence for HGP-1 inhibitory effect on metastasis.
It might indicate that HGP-1 did not have apparent

Inhibitory effect of HGP-1 on cell activities was
via affecting MET signaling
It is well documented that HGF/MET signaling
cascade is associated with cell proliferation and motility
[2]. To explore how HGP-1 inhibited cell proliferation and
migration through HGF/MET signaling, A549 cells pretreated by HGP-1 were lysed, and their phosphorylation
level of MET and ERK1/2 were measured by Western
Blot. The result showed that the phospho-MET level at
Tyr1234/1235 would decrease by 28% and 33% after
treated by 5 μM and 50 μM HGP-1 (Figure 6a and 6b),
while phospho-ERK1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204 was reduced
by 13% and 31% (Figure 6c, 6d). HGP-1 could inhibit
the phospho-MET level at the concentration of 5 μM and
display significant inhibitory effect on phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 at the concentration of 50 μM without affecting
expression of MET and ERK1/2 (Supplementary Figure
S9a). In sum, the inhibitory effect of HGP-1 on cell
proliferation and migration stimulated by HGF was
via affecting the activity of MET signaling. The result
from structure simulation through ZDOCK illustrated
that HGP-1 might bind to the C-terminal of HGF-β
(Supplementary Figure S10), which was close to the
binding site of HGF-β to MET [26]. It provided a possible
explanation for the inhibitory effect of HGP-1 on the
activation of HGF/MET signaling.

DISCUSSIONS
HGF/MET axis regulates cell proliferation,
migration and morphogenesis [3, 27]. The dysregulation
of this pathway has been implicated in cancer initiation,
development and even metastasis [28], which suggested
that targeting to HGF/MET axis is a potential strategy
in cancer targeted therapy. In this article, we obtained a
series of HGF targeting peptides and identified a peptide
candidate named HGP-1. HGP-1 either on the surface of
bacteria clone or synthesized, exhibited a moderate affinity
and good specificity for binding to HGF. As a HGF binder,
HGP-1 could inhibit cell proliferation both in vitro and
in vivo and migration at least in vitro via reducing the
phosphorylation level of MET and ERK1/2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

inhibitory effect on tumor metastasis at least with the
concentration applied. On the other hand, considering the
small volume of metastasis, the emitted bioluminescence
signal might not be observed by IVIS Lumina II system.
Although no obvious metastasis signal was recorded
via bioluminescence, we noticed that some phenomena
occurred which might be a consequence of metastasis. Two
mice in SP-H1 group presented limb movement disorder
in half side, along with wry neck, circle motion and rapid
weight loss on day 43 and day 47, but no mice in HGP-1
group appeared similar phenomena. It has been reported
that brain metastases from cervical carcinoma would lead
to Hemiballismus [35]. Therefore, we speculated that the
limb movement disorder of the two mice from SP-H1
might be the result from brain metastasis.
Taken together, we identified a peptide targeting
to HGF, which could behave as an inhibitor to HGF/
MET signaling. The HGF targeting peptide candidate
HGP-1 could inhibit cell proliferation and migration via
down-regulating the phosphosrylation levels of MET
and ERK1/2. Our studies revealed that peptides might
be effective targeting molecules for cancer targeted
therapeutics.

Human non-small lung cancer cell line A549
(TCHu150, Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank) was
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium. Human melanoma
cell line MDA-MB-435s (TCHu 36, Chinese Academy of
Sciences Cell Bank) was cultured in high glucose DMEM.
The medium were supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. All the cells were cultured at
37°C, in 5% CO2.

Bacteria clones were subcultured and induced
as described before. Then, 107 bacteria of each clone
were incubated with biotinylated HGF referring to
sorting procedure. After incubating with HGF, bacteria
were divided into two groups. The ‘original’ group was
washed referring to sorting procedure, and the ‘washed’
group would have a tough washing. After centrifuged at
3000 × g for 5 minutes, bacteria in ‘washed’ group were
resuspended by 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS, PH
7.4) and inverted at 4°C for 10 minutes. The washing steps
were repeated for 3 times. Samples from two groups were
analyzed by flow cytometry.
To examine the binding specificity of peptide on
the bacteria surface, 107 bacteria were incubated with
7 nM HGF alone or coupled with the same molarity of
VEGF-165, EGF, bFGF or BSA separately. The washing
steps were performed following sorting procedure. The
fluorescence signals of samples were recorded with flow
cytometer.

Screening of HGF binding peptide from a
random library
The bacteria display library of linear peptides was
a gift from Professor Patrick S. Daugherty (University of
California, Santa Barbara, United States). In this library,
peptide with 15 randomized amino acid positions (X15)
was displayed at the N-terminus of eCPX [36] as fusion
protein on the surface of Escherichia coli. The size of
library was 5 × 108.
The frozen stock was thawed and cultivated
overnight at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium (LB medium)
supplemented 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 0.2%
(w/v) D-(+)-glucose with shaking at 200 rpm. The
bacteria were subcultured 1:50 the next day for 2 hours
in LB medium at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm, and
then induced by 0.02% (w/v) L-(+)-arabinose for 1 hour
at room temperature to express the outer membrane
protein scaffold. The MACS was conducted with 42.5 nM
biotinylated HGF to reduce the size of library. When the
size of library was smaller than 107, FACS was performed.
The enriched library incubated with biotinylated HGF at
concentrations ranging from 20 nM to 5 nM to enrich the
high affinity HGF binding peptides at 4°C for 45 minutes.
Subsequently, Streptavidin R-phycoerythrin (SAPE) at a
final concentration of 3.3 nM was added to the mixture
following by the incubation at 4°C for 30 minutes. The
PE-A fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured
by FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson). The bacteria with
high PE-A fluorescence intensity were sorted and cultured
in LB medium overnight for another cycle of sorting. In
the last several cycles of sorting, 10% human serum was
supplemented to increase the sorting stringency [37]. The
bacteria sorted from the last cycle of sorting were plated
on a LB-agar plate for an overnight incubation. Bacteria
clones were obtained and sent to GENEWIZ Inc. for DNA
sequencing.

Examination of binding property of
soluble peptide
Peptides were synthesized in Shanghai Bootech
Bioscience & Technology Co., Ltd., and FITC was
labeled at the N- terminal of the peptide sequence. The
binding property of soluble peptides was determined by
fluorescence-based ELISA. Plates (#3925, Corning) were
coated with 15.6 nM of HGF or EGF in PBS (pH 7.4)
overnight at 4°C. Then, wells were blocked with 5% (m/v)
BSA for 1 hour with shaking at room temperature. Different
concentrations of FITC-labeled peptide (0.1 μM, 1 μM,
10 μM and 100 μM) were added to the wells respectively
for 1.5 hours incubation at room temperature. At last, the
fluorescence intensity of each well was determined by
VECTOR X4 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer).
To evaluate the specificity of soluble peptide, a
fluorescence-based ELISA was established. HGF was
coated on the plate with concentration of 14.3 nM in
PBS (pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C. Afterwards, plates were
blocked with 5% BSA for 1 hour with shaking at room
temperature. FITC-labeled peptide (10 μM) coupling with
different concentrations (0.05 nM, 0.5 nM, 5 nM and 50
nM) of HGF, VEGF-165, EGF, bFGF or BSA was added
into wells separately and incubated at room temperature
for 1.5 hours. The fluorescence intensity of each well
was determined by VECTOR X4 Multilabel Plate Reader
(PerkinElmer).

Measurement of KD for peptide binding to HGF
Kinetic (ka and kd) and affinity constant (KD) of
soluble peptide were determined by surface plasmon
resonance technique on a Biacore X100 instrument

Assessment of cell migration by scratch
wound assay

(GE healthcare). The research-grade CM5 sensor
chip was activated following the process which was
recommended in the amino coupling reagent kit.
Human full length HGF was dissolved in PBS and
diluted to a suitable concentration by 20 mM NaCOOH
buffer (pH4.0) and immobilized on the chip, and 2000
resonance units were immobilized. The remaining
reactive groups were inactivated by ethanolamine. The
peptide was dissolved and diluted by HBS-EP (100 mM
HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA-Na2 and 0.005%
P20, pH7.4). Samples composed of concentrations
ranging from 0 to 100 μM of peptides were injected
over the protein surface. Each sample was injected at
a flow rate of 30 μL/min for 2 minutes and followed
by 8 minutes of dissociation in HBS-EP buffer without
peptide [38]. Ka, Kd and KD were calculated by Biacore
X100 Evaluation software.

MDA-MB-435s cells were plated on a 24-well plate
(1 × 105 cells/well), grown to an 80–90% confluent cell
monolayer, and serum-starved for 24 hours. Wounds were
scratched gently with tip of a plastic pipet and washed
twice with PBS. Subsequently, HGF (0.625 nM) alone or
coupled with peptides at the concentrations of 61.5 nM and
615 nM were added into the wells for 2 days treatment.
Each well was photographed at 10 × magnification with
light microscope before and after peptide treatment. The
cell migration capabilities were assessed by calculating
the width alteration of the wound area by Photoshop [25].
The percentage of cell migration followed the equation:

MTT assay

Wound healing assay was applied to evaluate the
inhibitory effect of peptides to cell migration after oneday incubation with peptides at different concentrations in
medium with 10% FBS.

A549 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a
density of 7000 cells per well. After overnight culture,
cells were starved with serum free DMEM medium
for 48 hours. HGF (0.625 nM) alone or mixed with
concentrations ranging from 61.5 nM to 3.075 μM
of peptides was added into the cells post starvation.
After cultured for 4 days, the cell culture medium was
changed with fresh medium containing 0.5 mg/mL
3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) solution for another 4 hours incubation
at 37°C, in 5% CO2. Then, medium was removed and
cells were lysed with dimethyl sulfoxide [39]. The
absorption of the solution in each well was measured at
490 nm on a VECTOR X4 Multilabel Plate Reader. IC50
value was also determined and calculated by GraphPad
Prism 5.
MTT assay was also used to assess the cytotoxicity
of peptides after 4-day incubation with peptides at
different concentrations in the medium with 10% FBS.
The cells were seeded in the 96-well plate at density of
2000 cells per well.

Assessment of cell migration by transwell assay
MDA-MB-435s cells were detached by 0.25%
trypsin and diluted with serum-free medium to a final
concentration of 4 × 105 cells/mL post 24 hours serum
starvation. Serum free medium containing 1 nM HGF
alone or mixed with 1 μM peptides was added to wells
in 24-well plate (bottom chamber). The basal side
of membrane in the millicell chamber (PIEP12R48,
Millipore) was pre-coated with 10 μg/mL rat tail collagen
type I, and 0.1 mL cell suspension was added to millicell.
The millicell chambers were hanged over the wells and
cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2. After cultured for 18 hours,
cells on the basal side of the membrane were fixed, stained
with 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet and photographed. The
crystal violet in cells were then eluted and quantified by
measuring absorbance at 595 nm on the VECTOR X4
Multilabel Plate Reader [24, 26].

Measurement of Ki-67 expression levels
by flow cytometry

Assessment of cell migration by real-time
cellular analysis

A549 cells were cultured on a 12-well plate
(2 × 105 cells/well), grown to a 70–80% confluent cell
monolayer, and serum-starved for 24 hours. Fresh
medium containing 1 nM HGF alone or mixed with 1 μM
peptides was added into each well for 2 days treatment.
Afterwards cells were detached by 0.1% trypsin and
fixed by ethanol for 2 hours at 4°C. Then, cells were
incubated with Ki-67 antibody following the instruction
of the Ki67 cell proliferation Detection Kit. The FITC
fluorescence intensity of each sample was determined by
flow cytometry.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A549 cells were detached and diluted with serumfree medium to a final concentration of 8 × 105 cells/
mL post 24 hours serum starvation. The upper chamber
of CIM-16 plate was pre-coated with 10 μg/mL rat tail
collagen type I. Serum-free medium containing 2 nM
HGF alone or with peptides at concentrations ranging
from 1 μM to 100 μM was added into the bottom chamber
of CIM-plate. Afterwards, the device including upper
chamber hanging on the lower chamber was balanced at
37°C, in 5% CO2 for 1 hour and baseline was measured.

Statistics analysis

Before data recording, cell suspension was added into the
upper chamber and incubated at room temperature for
30 minutes. Cell index was measured every 15 minutes
during 22 hours on the xCELLigence DP system (ACEA
Biosciences, Inc.) [40].

All the data were expressed as means ± SEM.
Histogram and line charts were generated by GraphPad
Prism 5. T-test and ANOVA were used to determine the
P values. P-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Assessment of tumor growth in mice
xenograft model

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

Four to five-week-old female Balb/c nu mice (SLAC
Laboratory Animal) were used in the experiment. Mice
were injected subcutaneously in the flank with 2 × 106
luciferase-expressed A549 cells in 0.1 mL PBS. When the
tumor volumes reached 200 mm3, the mice were sacrificed.
Tumor mass was separated under aseptic conditions and
washed by PBS. After removing the thanatosis tissue,
tumor tissues were cut into small cubes (approximately
1 mm3) and transplanted to mice right hindpaw [41]. The
mice were randomized into SP-H1 (Scramble peptide of
HGP-1) and HGP-1 group (8 mice per group). Peptides
were subcutaneously administrated (10 mg/kg) every other
day for 6 times two days post transplantation. The tumor
volumes and the weights of mice were measured every 2–3
days. Tumor volume = 1/2 × a × b2 (a is the length, b is the
width). The mice were photographed in an IVIS Lumina II
system (Caliper LifeScience) and ROIs of bioluminescence
were analyzed to evaluate tumor growth at two different
time points. All animal studies were approved by a local
Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments.

Structure prediction and model construction
of HGP-1
Three-dimensional models of the HGP-1 were
constructed through the Local Meta-Threading Server
(http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/LOMETS/) [42] for
the selection of the best model with the highest confidence
score. The structure of the complex between the HGP-1
