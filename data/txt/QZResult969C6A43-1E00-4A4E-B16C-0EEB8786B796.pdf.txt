ABSTRACT:
HER2, an oncogenic receptor is overexpressed in about 25-30% of breast cancer
patients. HER2 has been shown to play role in tumor promotion by having cross-talk
with multiple oncogenic pathways in cancer cells. Our results show that Cucurbitacin
B (CuB), a triterpenoid steroidal compound inhibited the growth of various breast
cancer cells with an IC50 ranging from 18-50nM after 48 and 72 h of treatment. Our
study also revealed the significant inhibitory effects of CuB on HER2 and integrin
signaling in breast cancer. Notably, CuB inhibited ITGA6 and ITGB4 (integrin α6
& integrin β4), which are overexpressed in breast cancer. Furthermore, CuB also
induced the expression of major ITGB1and ITGB3, which are known to cause integrinmediated cell death. In addition, we observed that TGFβ treatment resulted in the
increased association of HER2 with ITGA6 and this association was inhibited by CuB
treatment. Efficacy of CuB was tested in vivo using two different orthotopic models
of breast cancer. MDA-MB-231 and 4T-1 cells were injected orthotopically in the
mammary fat pad of female athymic nude mice or BALB/c mice respectively. Our
results showed that CuB administration inhibited MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumors by
55%, and 4T-1 tumors by 40%. The 4T-1 cells represent stage IV breast cancer and
form very aggressive tumors. CuB mediated breast tumor growth suppression was
associated with the inhibition of HER2/integrin signaling. Our results suggest novel
targets of CuB in breast cancer in vitro and in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

has been shown to interact with several other growth
promoting mechanisms like TGFβ, estrogen receptor,
FOXO1A, Src kinases, ILK and integrins to reinforce
oncogenesis and metastasis [11-16]. Trastuzumab
(herceptin) is a specific antibody for HER2 that is used
against HER2+ breast cancer. But studies indicate
limitations of trastuzumab therapy due to cardio-toxicity
and resistance in patients [17].
Integrins is a large family of cell adhesion
receptors, which also perform other diverse functions
like cell survival and motility. Various integrins have
been implicated in tumor cell survival, proliferation
and metastasis [18, 19]. Importantly, two major integrin
heterodimers ITGAVB3 (αVβ3) and ITGA6B4 (α6β4)
have been found to play specific role in breast cancer

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed
malignancy in women. Studies suggest that around
232,340 new cases will be diagnosed and around 39,620
women will die due to breast cancer by the end of
2013 [1]. The HER2/neu is a proto-oncogene, which is
amplified in several neoplasms like breast, salivary gland,
stomach, kidney and lung [2-7]. It is overexpressed in
about 30% of breast cancer patients, which leads to poor
clinical outcomes [2-7]. HER2 is a mitogenic tyrosine
kinase receptor, known to induce transforming signals
and hence directly promotes cell proliferation [8]. The
HER2 expression can lead to impaired DNA repair [8],
angiogenesis [9] and metastasis [10]. Furthermore, HER2

progression and metastasis [20-26]. There is a strong
evidence that cross-talk between HER2 and ITGA6B4
promotes tumor aggressiveness [16, 27-29]. ITGB4
(Integrin β4) contributes to HER2 up-regulation in
mammary tumors suggesting a strong correlation between
HER2 and integrins in mammary tumor development
and progression [30]. Identification of novel agents that
can target both HER2 and integrin signaling could be
beneficial for the treatment of breast cancer overexpressing
HER2.
Cucurbitacins are triterpenoid steroidal compounds
mainly present in the Cucurbitaceae family of plants
[31]. Several evidences suggest the cytotoxic properties
of Cucurbitacin B (CuB) through cell cycle arrest and
STAT3 inhibition in pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular
carcinoma [32-35]. However, the exact mechanism of CuB
is not clear.
The objective of the current study was to evaluate
whether CuB could suppress breast cancer growth by
inhibiting HER2/integrin signaling. Our results showed
that CuB inhibits HER2 expression in breast cancer
cells through ILK1 and YB-1 in both in vitro and in vivo
models. In addition, it was observed that CuB inhibits
ITGA6B4 (integrin α6β4) signaling and the subsequent
cross-talk with HER2. Our study provides a novel insight
into the mechanism of action of CuB along with evidence
for the role of HER2-integrin signaling in breast cancer.

non-toxic to the normal cells at the concentrations required
for inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.
To explore the mechanism of the growth inhibitory
effects of CuB, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3 and MCF-7 cells
were treated with 0, 15, 25, 50 and 75nM CuB for 48 or
72h. 4T-1 cells required higher concentration of CuB for
induction of apoptosis and the molecular changes hence
were treated with 0, 20, 40, 80 and 150nM CuB for 48h.
The cells were analyzed for apoptosis using Annexin V
assay. As shown in Fig. 1E & F, 75nM CuB treatment for
72h induced apoptosis in about 80% of SKBR3 cells and
about 60% in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and 4T-1 cells. To
further investigate the mechanism of apoptosis in CuB
treated breast cancer cells, western blot analysis was
performed. The western blot data of whole cell lysates
from CuB treated MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, MCF-7 and
4T-1 cells showed significant down-regulation of Bcl2 and
survivin (Fig. 2A-D). Although, SKBR3 cells expressed
low constitutive levels of Bcl2 and survivin, the extent
of apoptosis induced by CuB was comparable with other
cell lines indicating the role of multiple pathways in CuB
mediated cell death. On the other hand, expression of
pro-apoptotic BIM was up-regulated along with cleavage
of Caspase 8 (Fig. 2A-D). We were unable to detect the
cleaved fragments of Caspase 3 and hence looked at full
length Caspase 3 (pro-caspase 3). The expression of fulllength Caspase 3 decreased in response to CuB treatment
in all the cell lines tested indicating apoptosis (Fig. 2A-D).
These observations indicate the concentration-dependent
induction of apoptosis by CuB in breast cancer cells.
Interestingly, we observed cleavage of BAX by
CuB treatment. Expression of BAX generally increases in
response to apoptotic stimuli leading to caspase activation
[37]. BAX cleavage mediated by caspases or calpains is
known to play a much stronger role in apoptosis [38, 39].
We observed that CuB treatment caused a concentration
dependent cleavage of BAX at both 48h and 72h time
points in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3, while no cleavage
was observed in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A-C). To prove it
further, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with caspase 3
inhibitor along with CuB treatment. The results from this
experiment showed that caspase 3 inhibitor significantly
blocked CuB mediated cleavage of BAX (Fig. 2E). Since
MCF-7 is a caspase 3 null cell line, no cleavage of BAX
was observed. These results indicate a direct role of
caspase 3 in BAX cleavage in our model [40].

RESULTS
CuB inhibits breast cancer cell growth by
inducing apoptosis
Considering breast tumor heterogeneity, we used
four different cell lines with diverse phenotype and
genotype. Treatment of MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, MCF-7
and 4T-1 breast cancer cells with increasing concentrations
of CuB significantly reduced the survival of these cells in
a concentration and time-dependent manner with an IC50
ranging between 18 – 50nM after 48 and 72h treatment
(Fig. 1A - D). Previous studies reported significantly high
IC50 of CuB in normal mammary epithelial cell lines as
compared to SKBR3 breast cancer cells [36]. To confirm
the non-toxic effects of CuB, we evaluated its toxicity in
a normal human melanocyte epithelial (PIG1) cells. Our
results showed that the viability of PIG1 cells treated
with CuB was least affected as compared to the viability
of cancer cells (Suppl. Fig 1A). For example, treatment
of with 50nM CuB for 72h inhibited the growth of PIG1
cells by 20-30% only. However, the growth of cancer
cell lines like SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and 4-T1
were inhibited by 50-70% after treatment with CuB under
similar conditions (Suppl. Fig 1B). These results along
with previous observations suggest that CuB is relatively

CuB treatment suppresses HER2 signaling
To determine the mechanism of cell death induced
by CuB treatment, cell lysates were analyzed by western
blotting. Our results showed that treatment of MDAMB-231, SKBR3, MCF-7 and 4T-1 cells with CuB after
48 or 72h of treatment significantly reduced HER2 and
EGFR expression in a concentration-dependent manner
(Fig. 3A-D). Although both HER2 and EGFR were

reduced after 72h of CuB treatment, effect of CuB was
more pronounced at 48h in SKBR3 and MCF-7 cells.
CuB inhibited HER2 in all the cell lines irrespective of
ER or p53 status. Phosphorylated EGFR was undetectable
in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and 4T-1 cells. However, CuB
treatment significantly suppressed the phosphorylation
of EGFR at Y-992 after 72h treatment in SKBR3 cells
(Fig. 3B). CuB treatment also substantially reduced the
expression and phosphorylation of Src at Y-416 along
with decreased phosphorylation of p130CAS at Y-410.
The inhibitory effects of CuB on the phosphorylation
and expression of Src varied with duration of treatment
in MDA-MB-231, SKBR3 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3AD). However, longer treatment did not cause any further

suppression of phosphorylated p130CAS in any cell
line. p130CAS is a downstream effector molecule of
Src. Src plays a vital role in the cross-talk of HER2 with
integrins in breast tumors [16]. Furthermore, we observed
suppression of TNFα-converting enzyme protease (TACE)
by CuB treatment (Fig. 3A-D). The 72h treatment with
CuB caused more TACE inhibition as compared to 48h
treatment in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A &
C). TACE has been implicated in the activation of EGFR
and HER2 by TGFβ [16, 41]. Since CuB down-regulated
HER2 expression, it was important to test the effect of CuB
on the regulatory molecules of HER2. As shown in Fig.
3A-D, treatment of cells with CuB substantially reduced
the expression of ILK1 and Twist. It was observed that

CuB suppresses ITGA6B4

in MCF-7 cells, CuB treatment reduced ILK1 expression
more at 72h treatment as compared to 48h. TWIST
suppression was more pronounced at 48h treatment with
CuB in all the three cell lines. Furthermore, suppression of
YB-1 expression as well its phosphorylation at S-102 was
also observed with CuB treatment (Fig. 3A-D). The ILK1/
YB-1/Twist signaling axis has been known to regulate
HER2 expression in breast cancer cells [15]. Our results
showed that higher HER2 inhibition was observed at 48h
in only those cell lines where TWIST along with ILK
or YB1 were also inhibited. These observations suggest
that inhibition of HER2 by CuB was associated with the
inhibition of ILK1/YB-1 signaling.

To evaluate the role of CuB on integrin signaling,
MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, MCF-7 and 4T-1 cells were
treated with CuB for 48 and 72h. Our results showed that
CuB significantly suppressed the expression of ITGA6
and ITGB4 as compared to other integrins in the cell lines
tested in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A-D). The other
integrins were either not affected at all or very modest
changes were observed by CuB treatment. These results
indicate that CuB causes specific inhibition of ITGA6
and ITGB4, which interestingly are overexpressed in
breast cancer and interacts with HER2. On the other hand,

Figure 4: CuB suppresses integrin α6/β4 expression: (A) MDA-MB-231 (B) SKBR3 (C) MCF-7 and (D) 4T-1 cells were

blots were immune-probed for the integrins ITGB1 (integrin β1), ITGA5 (integrin α5), ITGAV (integrin αv), ITGB3 (integrin β3), ITGB5

the pro-apoptotic ITGB1 and ITGB3 were induced in a
time-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3
cells after treatment with similar concentrations of CuB.
Although, significant induction of ITGB1 was observed
at 48h treatment with CuB in MCF-7 cells, cleavage of
caspase 8 or apoptosis did not correlated as compared with
other cells. The induction of pro-apoptotic ITGB1 and
ITGB3 by CuB treatment suggests activation of integrins
mediated cell death by CuB in MDA-MB-231, SKBR3
and 4T-1 breast cancer cells.

integrins. TGFβ treatment significantly increased the
expression of ITGA6 by about 1.5 fold in MDA-MB-231
and 4T-1 cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, when HER2
was immune-precipitated from TGFβ treated cells, we
observed that TGFβ treatment increased the expression of
ITGA6 associated with HER2 (Fig. 5B). However, this
interaction was inhibited by CuB treatment (Fig. 5C).
These observations propose a novel mechanism of tumor
promotion by TGFβ by increasing the association between
ITGA6 and HER2, possibly due to induction of ITGA6.
Our results thus provide a novel insight into TGFβmediated physical interaction between HER2 and ITGA6.
However, further studies are required to confirm the
detailed mechanism and implications of this interaction.
To determine the effect of CuB on integrin signaling
in presence of TGFβ, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
with CuB (50nM) after treatment with TGFβ (10ng/ml).

CuB inhibits TGFβ mediated interaction of HER2
with ITGA6
Since TGFβ is known to activate HER2/integrin
signaling, we evaluated the interaction of HER2 with

of AKT at S-473 and ERK at T-202/204 (Fig. 6A-D). Both
AKT and ERK are important downstream targets of ILK1paxillin complex. Consistently, CuB treatment suppressed
the phosphorylation of GSK3β at S-9 while enhancing
its protein level in a concentration and time dependent
manner (Fig. 6A-D). AKT is known to negatively regulate
GSK3β in cancer cells. CuB also suppressed ROCK1 and
RhoA kinases which play important role in cell motility
(Fig. 6A-D). Both the kinases are known to be activated
by integrins and are important targets of Akt.

Inhibition of integrin signaling by CuB
Next we tested the effects of CuB on downstream
signaling of integrins in breast cancer cells. MDAMB-231, SKBR3, MCF-7 and 4T-1 cells were treated with
various concentrations of CuB for 48 or 72h. As shown
in Fig. 6A-D, CuB treatment suppressed the expression
and phosphorylation of paxillin at Y-118 (Fig. 6A-D). A
significant down-regulation of ILK1 was also observed
by CuB treatment. ILK1-paxillin complex regulated by
integrins serves as a major mechanism for various cell
survival processes. CuB also inhibited the phosphorylation

in the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice.
Once each mouse attained palpable tumors, mice were
randomly divided into two groups with ten mice in each
group. Treatment group received 2mg/kg CuB everyday
by oral gavage. The tumor growth was monitored by
measuring tumor volumes periodically. Our results
showed that oral gavage of CuB significantly reduced
the growth of breast tumors (Fig. 7A). At day 60 of the
treatment, tumor volume in the treated group was reduced
by 55% as compared to the control group [249.5±30.3mm3
vs 111.3±18.4mm3; (n=10)] (Fig. 7Ai). The weight of the
MDA-MB-231 tumors dissected from treated mice was
about 53% less than the weight of tumors from control
mice (Fig. 7Aii). The weight of mice did not change
significantly with oral gavage, indicating no apparent
systemic toxicity in CuB-treated mice (Fig. 7Aiii). In the
other experiment, 0.1X106 4T-1 breast cancer cells were

injected in the mammary fat pads of female BALB/c
mice. 4T-1 cells are highly aggressive and considered
to be late stage breast cancer. Once each mouse attained
palpable tumors, mice were segregated into two groups
with eight mice in each group. 1mg/kg CuB was given
intraperitoneally, every third day to the mice of treatment
group and the growth of the tumors monitored. The growth
of tumors in CuB treated group was reduced significantly
as compared to control group (Fig. 7B). For example,
at day 28 of the treatment, 4T-1 tumor volume in the
treated group was reduced by 39% as compared to control
group [2355.3±236.4mm3 vs 1446.7±142.6mm3; (n=8)]
(Fig. 7Bi). Similarly, the weight of the tumors in treated
mice was reduced by 27% (Fig. 7Bii & iv). A transitory
reduction in weight was observed in the mice receiving
i.p. administration of CuB as compared to control, which
ameliorated with time (Fig. 7Biii). Since the weight of the

DISCUSSION

mice dropped initially after intraperitoneal administration,
we decided to evaluate the mice of treated group for any
signs of gross toxicity. The organs of control and treated
mice were weighed once the experiment was terminated.
No change in the weight of organs like liver, spleen,
kidney, lungs, brain and heart were observed in CuB
treated mice as compared to control mice (Table 1). The
enzymatic activities of AST, ALT and LDH were also
evaluated in the plasma of control and CuB treated mice.
Although, no significant change in the activity of ALT and
AST was observed, interestingly, plasma LDH level was
reduced by 24.3% in the mice of CuB treated group (Table
2). The exact reasons behind the decrease in LDH level by
CuB treatment was not clear and require further studies.
To determine if the tumor growth suppression
in vivo by CuB was associated with the inhibition of
HER2/integrins, immunohistochemistry (IHC) of tumor
sections and western blot of the tumor tissue lysates
was performed. The tumor sections from CuB treated
mice showed reduced expression of HER2 and ITGB4
in MDA-MB-231 as well as 4T-1 tumor sections (Fig. 8
A & B). Our western blot results also confirmed that the
expression of HER2, ITGA6 and ITGB4 were suppressed
in the tumors of CuB treated mice (Fig. 8A & B). Tumor
lysates from CuB treated mice also revealed suppression
of phospho YB-1 (S-102) and Twist, which are known
to regulate HER2 expression in breast cancer cells. In
addition to suppression of HER2-associated signaling,
CuB treatment also inhibited integrins’ downstream
signaling molecules like phospho paxillin (Y118) and
ILK1 in the tumors. The induction of apoptosis by CuB
treatment was confirmed through down-regulation of Bcl2 and pro-caspase 3 in the tumors of CuB treated mice.
Taken together, these results indicate that the breast tumor
growth suppression by CuB in vivo was associated with
the inhibition of HER2/integrin signaling validating our
in vitro observations.

HER2 overexpression is observed in about onefourth of breast cancer patients and is a major cause for
poor prognosis [3]. The crosstalk of HER2 with several
other growth signaling pathways results in extremely
aggressive form of cancer, imparting high resistance
to conventional therapeutic modalities [42]. Our study
identified a unique HER2-integrin signaling axis in
breast cancer that was inhibited by CuB, a novel steroidal
triterpenoid compound [31].
Several previous studies used CuB extracted from
plants instead of using commercially available pure
compound to evaluate cytotoxicity. Tannin-Spitz et. al.
used the plant extract to evaluate the cytotoxic properties
of CuB [43]. This study showed an IC50 of 8µM in
MDA-MB-231 cells after 48h of treatment. On the other
hand, Promkan et al. observed an IC50 of 70µM (38.9µg/
ml) after 48h of treatment [44]. In contrast to these
studies, our study showed significantly reduced effective
concentrations of CuB. The IC50 of CuB after 72h of
treatment ranged between 18nM and 50nM in most of the
breast cancer cell lines tested. Our results are in agreement
with the IC50 observed by Wakimoto et. al., who used
pure CuB [45]. Hence, differences in the IC50 of CuB in
the published literature could be attributed to the purity
of CuB and cancer model. We observed that CuB was
effective in 4T-1 cells at slightly higher concentrations as
compared to other cell lines. This could be due to several
reasons: 4T-1 cells overexpress p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and
hence is resistant to several chemotherapeutic agents [46].
It is possible that CuB could be the substrate for P-gp,
leading to a requirement of higher concentrations of CuB
in this cell line. Secondly, 4T-1 is a very aggressive and
resistant cell line as compared to other cells used in our
study, thus needing more CuB to suppress its growth.
Our studies showed that CuB treatment induced
caspase mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
Apoptosis was confirmed through cleavage of caspase 8
and inhibition of full-length caspase 3. It is known that
Bcl2 and survivin play a crucial role in caspase inhibition

and their inhibition leads to activation of caspases.
We observed significant reduction of these proteins by
CuB treatment. Although, SKBR3 cells expressed low
constitutive levels of Bcl2 and survivin, the apoptosis
inducing effect of CuB was not compromised in SKBR3
cells, suggesting the role of other intermediary molecules.
BAX is an important protein that regulates the activation
of caspases and accumulation of BAX leads to apoptosis
[37]. On the other hand, several studies have shown that
cleavage of BAX mediated by caspases and calpains
also plays a critical role in apoptosis [38, 39].Our results
showed a concentration-dependent cleavage of BAX
by CuB treatment in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells.
However, the cleavage of BAX was not observed in MCF7 cells. This is not surprising as MCF-7 is a caspase 3 null
cell line [40]. Cleavage of BAX by CuB was significantly
blocked by caspase 3 inhibitor. These observations suggest
a direct role of caspase 3 in BAX cleavage induced by
CuB treatment. However, further studies are required to
confirm the mechanism and implications of BAX cleavage
by CuB.
Our results indicated TGFβ mediated interaction of
HER2 with integrins. HER2 utilizes multiple mechanisms
to enhance tumorigenicity. Kalra et. al. have shown
that ILK1 regulates HER2 expression by coordinating
the molecular functions of TWIST and YB-1 [15].
In agreement, our results showed that CuB treatment
inhibited ILK1/YB-1/TWIST signaling, which can explain
the down-regulation of HER2 in our model.
Furthermore, the tumorigenicity by EGFR family
of receptors is known to be mediated by Src kinase and
Src inhibition can lead to suppression of tumorigenicity
[14, 47]. Our results demonstrated significant inhibition
of Src expression and phosphorylation by CuB treatment.
These changes were accompanied with suppression of
phosphorylated P130CAS, the downstream effector
molecule of Src kinase [48]. Interestingly, TACE
dependent ligand shedding is also known to play role
in regulating HER2-integrin signaling in breast cancer
[16]. We observed suppression of TACE expression by
CuB treatment in all the breast cancer cell lines tested.
These observations suggest significant influence of CuB
treatment on HER2 and related signaling in breast cancer
irrespective of genotypes and phenotypes of various breast
cancer cells used in our studies.
Integrins are the master regulators of various cellular
processes [49]. ITGA6B4 has been recently identified
to play a significant role in breast cancer progression
through diverse mechanisms [20, 21, 26, 50-53]. ITGB4
is of special prognostic significance in basal type breast
cancer exemplified by MDA-MB-231 cells used in this
study [54]. Evidence suggests that HER2 is present at the
crossroad of integrin signaling in breast cancer [27, 29,
55]. Guo et. al. demonstrated that ITGB4 augments HER2
signaling to promote breast cancer progression, while
another study by Wang et. al. demonstrated augmentation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of ITGA6B4 by HER2 [28, 30]. Furthermore, a study
supports the physical interaction of HER2 with ITGA6,
ITGB1 and ITGB4, which can be augmented by TGFβ
[16]. These studies also suggest that inhibition of the
interaction of HER2 with integrins can be exploited for
therapeutic advantage [16]. Our studies confirm the
interaction of HER2 with ITGA6. Interestingly, we made
a unique observation that TGFβ treatment also increased
the constitutive expression of ITGA6, which might be
the reason of enhanced interaction of ITGA6 with HER2
by TGFβ treatment. Nonetheless, this interaction was
inhibited by CuB treatment. Our observations confirm the
interplay between HER2 and integrin α6β4 in breast cancer
cells, while suggesting a direct role of TGFβ in enhancing
the interaction. Our results also suggest that inhibition
of HER2 interaction with these integrins can serve as a
powerful mechanism for anti-cancer therapeutics.
In addition to cross-talk with HER2, integrin
heterodimers also enhance cell survival by direct
signaling [56]. The cytoplasmic domains of heterodimers
of β integrins can interact with adaptor proteins like ILK
(Integrin linked Kinase) and paxillin to enhance survival
signals through AKT and ERK, leading to inactivation
of GSK3β and activation of Rho kinases like ROCK1
and RhoA [57, 58]. Our data clearly shows inhibition of
ILK1, paxillin, Akt, ERK and Rho kinases while inducing
GSK3β by CuB treatment in breast cancer cells. Our timedependent study indicated that HER2 inhibition was more
prominent at 48h of CuB treatment whereas, inhibition of
integrins was more at 72h. Therefore, these results suggest
that inhibition of integrin followed HER2 inhibition,
indicating a link between these pathways.
Interestingly, ITGB1 and ITGB3 have been shown
to induce apoptosis through recruitment of caspase8, the
process known as integrin-mediated death (IMD) [18].
We observed an increase in the expression of ITGB1,
ITGB3 and cleavage of caspase 8 by CuB treatment in
MDA-MB-231, SKBR3 and 4T-1 cells, suggesting CuB
mediated IMD. However, further studies are required to
confirm this mechanism.
Zhang et. al. used 1mg/kg CuB through
intraperitoneal injection thrice a week against melanoma
tumors. They observed about 50% suppression of tumor
growth after 23 days [59]. Kausar et. al. observed that
treatment with 1mg/kg CuB every alternate day for 5
weeks reduced the volume of non-small lung carcinoma
tumor xenografts by 70% [60]. Furthermore, as shown by
Aribi et. al., CuB suppressed MDA-MB-231 orthotopic
tumor volume by 42% and 55% at dose of 0.5 and 1mg/
kg (i.p.) respectively after 36 days of treatment [61]. In
agreement to this study, we also observed a 55% reduction
in tumor volumes when 2mg/kg CuB was administered
orally every day for 60 days. In addition, in another
orthotopic tumor experiment, we employed murine
breast cancer cell line 4T-1, which represents late stage
aggressive breast carcinoma, and treated the mice with
1823

Oncotarget

1mg/kg CuB i.p., every third day [62]. After 28 days,
the average tumor volume in treated mice was found to
be about 39% reduced as compared to tumors in control
mice. Our two different in vivo tumor experiments confirm
the anti-breast tumor properties of CuB. The tumors of
CuB treated mice exhibited inhibitions of HER2/integrins
signaling, validating our in vitro observations. The two
tumor models used in this study displayed significantly
different tumor growth kinetics. However, CuB suppressed
the tumor growth in both the models by inhibiting HER2/
integrin signaling.
Taken together, our results indicate inhibition of
HER2-integrin signaling as a novel anti-cancer mechanism
of CuB in breast cancer cells. The HER2 inhibition
correlates with suppression of ITGA6 and ITGB4, which
further lead to inhibition of integrin-mediated cell survival
through ILK1 and paxillin. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report on induction of apoptosis in breast
cancer cells through HER2-integrin signaling inhibition.

and treated with different concentrations (0-100nM) of
Cucurbitacin B (CuB) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
for various time intervals. The cells were fixed with ice
cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed and stained with
sulforhodamine B (SRB) dye and the optical density was
measured in Tris base solution using plate reader, after
washing the dye with 1% acetic acid solution as described
by us previously [63, 64].

Annexin-FITC apoptosis assay:
Apoptosis assay was performed using a kit (BD
Biosciences, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Approximately, 0.1x106 cells were plated in 6-well plate
and left overnight for attachment. After treatment for 48
and 72h with 0-75nM CuB, cells were harvested after
trypsinization, washed and suspended in binding buffer to
have cell density of 1x106/ml. A 5.0µl of Annexin V-FITC
and 5µl of propidium iodide (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA) were added to the 100µl of suspension and incubated
for additional 20 min at room temperature in dark. Total
sample volume was made up to 200µl with binding buffer.
Samples were analyzed by flow cytometer after vortexing
(Accuri C6, MI).

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Ethics Statement:

Western Blot Analysis:

Experiments were conducted in accordance with the
ethical standards and according to approved protocol by
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Human breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231
and MCF-7 were purchased from ATCC and recently
authenticated by STR analysis by our core facility.
SKBR3 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Terumi KohwiShigematsu (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,
Berkeley, CA, USA). These cells were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% PSN [10].
The 4T-1 cells were purchased from Perkin Elmers (Santa
Clara, CA, USA). These cells were maintained in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% PSN. All the
cells used in this study were within twenty passages after
receipt or resuscitation. The cells were maintained and
passaged in culture as described by us previously [63].
MCF-7 is an ER positive cell line with wild type
p53 while MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 are ER negative
cells and harbor mutated p53. 4T-1 cells are triple negative
and p53 null murine cells representing stage IV metastatic
breast cancer.

Various breast cancer cells were treated with
varying concentrations of CuB (0, 25, 50 and 75nM
except for 4T-1 cells, which were treated with 0, 40, 80
and 150nM) for 48 or 72h. The MDA-MB-231 cells were
treated with 50nM Q-VD-OPH, a caspase 3 inhibitor
(Apoptrol, Enon, OH), 1h prior to treatment with CuB and
the cells were collected after 48h. In another experiment,
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10ng/ml TGFβ
(Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 1h prior to the treatment
with 50nM CuB for 48h. Whole cell lysates were prepared
using 4% (w/v) CHAPS buffer while tumor lysates were
prepared by homogenizing the tumors in RIPA lysis
buffer. Proteins from control and treated samples were
subjected to SDS-PAGE and the segregated proteins
were transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane
was developed as described by us previously [63, 65,
66]. All antibodies used in the study were purchased
from Cell signaling except HER2 (Abcam, Cambridge,
MA), ITGB4 (Santacruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX),
TWIST (Santacruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), phospho
Akt (S473) (Santacruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and
Caspase 3 (Santacruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX).

vehicle alone. Mice were sacrificed on day 28 by CO2
overdose and death was confirmed by cervical dislocation
in accordance with IACUC guidelines. The tumors were
removed aseptically from each mouse, weighed and snap
frozen in liquid-nitrogen for further analysis.

Immunohistochemistry:

Tumor therapy model:

The immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed as
previously described by our lab [69]. Paraffin-embedded
tumor tissues were sectioned into 5µm thick sections using
microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove,
IL). The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated by
performing three washes of xylene for 5 minutes each, two
washes of 100% ethanol for 10 minutes followed by two
washes of 95% ethanol for 10 minutes and the sections
were given two 5 minute washes in double-distilled water
(dH2O). Antigens were unmasked by boiling the sections
in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) followed by
incubating the sections at room temperature for about
30 minutes for cooling down. The slides were washed in
dH2O three times for 5 minutes each, then incubated in
3% hydrogen peroxide solution in methanol for 10 minutes
followed by two washes in dH2O for 5 minutes each.
Tumor sections were then washed twice in wash buffer
(PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) for 5 minutes each, blocked in
200 μL of blocking solution (5% goat serum diluted in 1%
bovine serum albumin solution in PBS) for 30 minutes at
room temperature, and incubated with anti–HER2 (1:150)
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or anti-ITGB4 antibody (1:150)
(Santacruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) overnight at 4°C.
Next day primary antibody was removed and the sections
were washed three times in wash buffer for 10 minutes
each followed by incubation with Ultravision ONE HRP
polymer (Thermofisher scientific, Fremont, CA) for 30
minutes. Subsequently, sections were washed with wash
buffer and incubated with DAB Plus chromogen as per
the manufacturer’s instructions for 15-20 minutes. The
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and
dehydrated by incubating in 95% ethanol followed by two
incubations in 100% ethanol for 5 minutes each and final
incubation was done in xylene for 5 minutes. The slides
were mounted using Permount (Fisher scientific, Fair
Lawn, NJ) and analyzed under a phase-contrast Olympus
microscope (Olympus America Inc).

Female athymic nude mice (4-6 weeks old)
were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Ban harbor,
Maine, USA) and maintained under specific pathogenfree conditions. The use of athymic nude mice and their
treatment was approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC), Texas Tech University
Health Sciences Center, and the experiments were
conducted in strict compliance with the regulations.
Mice were given antioxidant-free AIN-76A special diet
(TestDiet, Richmond, IN) one week before starting the
experiment. Exponentially growing MDA-MB-231 cells
were harvested, washed and resuspended in PBS at a
density of 50x106 cells per ml with 80% matrigel (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA). A suspension of 0.1mL
containing 5x106 cells was injected in the mammary fat
pads of the recipient mice. Tumor volumes and animal
weights were measured twice a week as described by us
previously [68, 69]. When the tumors reached a size of
about 50-80 mm3, mice were randomly segregated into
two groups with ten mice in each group. Test group of
mice received 2mg/kg CuB in PBS by oral gavage every
day till day 60, whereas control mice received vehicle
alone. Mice were sacrificed on day 60 by CO2 overdose
and death was confirmed by cervical dislocation in
accordance with IACUC guidelines. The tumors were
dissected out aseptically from each mouse, weighed and
snap frozen in liquid-nitrogen for western blot analysis.
In another experiment, female BALB/c mice (4-6
weeks old) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Ban
harbor, Maine, USA) and maintained under controlled
humidity and temperature conditions. The use of BALB/c
mice and their treatment was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Texas Tech
University Health Sciences Center, and the experiments
were conducted in strict compliance with the regulations.
Exponentially growing 4T-1 cells were harvested, washed
and re-suspended in PBS at a density of 1x106 cells per
ml with 50% matrigel. A suspension of 0.1mL containing
0.1x106 cells was injected in the mammary fat pads of the
recipient mice. Tumor volumes and animal weights were
measured every alternate day as described by us previously
[68, 69]. When the tumors reached a size of about 30-50
mm3, mice were randomly segregated into two groups
with eight mice in each group. The treatment group
of mice received 1mg/kg CuB in PBS by i.p. injection
every third day till day 28. The control mice received
