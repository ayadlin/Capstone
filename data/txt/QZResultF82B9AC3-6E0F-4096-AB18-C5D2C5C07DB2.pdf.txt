BACKGROUND. MPS160 (GRAMLGTHTMEVTV) is a glycoprotein 100-derived melanoma peptide that contains overlapping human leukemic antigen A2-, DR53-,
and DQw6-restricted T-cell epitopes. In preclinical testing, MPS160 demonstrated
superior immunization and antitumor activity. In this report, the authors present

the results from a clinical trial that evaluated the safety and immunologic efficacy of the MPS160 vaccine in patients with metastatic melanoma.

METHODS. Patients with stage IV melanoma were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment
arms: 1) MPS160 in incomplete Freund adjuvant (Montanide ISA-51); 2) MPS160
in Montanide ISA-51 with 75 lg of granulocyte-macrophage–stimulating factor
(GM-CSF); or 3) MPS160 in Montanide ISA-51 with 100 lg of GM-CSF. Vaccines
were administered every 3 weeks until patients developed disease progression or
severe toxicity. Patients were aged 18 years with metastatic melanoma and a
good performance status. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy/nursing, brain
metastases, and ongoing chemotherapy. Immunologic efficacy was ascertained
by using tetramer and functional analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes.

RESULTS. None of the 28 patients exhibited objective tumor responses or severe
toxicities. Four patients remained progression free for 100 days. Immunologic
analysis was available for 21 patients. Laboratory data demonstrated 1) increased
frequency of vaccine-specific, nonfunctional cytotoxic T lymphocytes in 10
patients; 2) no differences in immunization efficacy among the treatment arms;
and 3) evidence of systemic cytokine/immune dysfunction.

CONCLUSIONS. Clinically, the MPS160 vaccine was ineffective. Phenotypic (tetramer) evidence of immunization was ineffective functionally and most likely
was caused by global immune dysfunction, as illustrated by abnormal cytokine
profiles in peripheral blood. In this report, the authors discuss possible implications of the current results on future cancer vaccine studies. Cancer

umerous clinical trial efforts of therapeutic cancer vaccines in
patients with metastatic malignant melanoma have yet to
demonstrate significant clinical benefit. Explanations for this clinical
shortfall have included 1) endogenous dendritic cell (DC) dysfunction leading to poor immunization efficacy1; 2) poor functioning of
peripheral blood-derived, peptide vaccine-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) showing no correlation with clinical outcomes2,3;
and 3) the presence of powerful immune-response down-regulatory

signals (eg, Treg) at the tumor microenvironment.4
However, occasional patients continue to demonstrate remarkable clinical responses to T-cell-directed
immunotherapeutic/immunomodulatory
interventions (eg, interleukin 2 [IL-2] and anti-CTLA4).5–10
Although they are nonspecific, these observations
suggest that tumor-associated immune suppression
in humans potentially may be overcome and may
result in clinical benefit.
In this report, we present the results from a clinical
trial in which we used a synthetic peptide with overlapping human leukemic antigen (HLA) class I and II binding cell epitopes (MPS160), which was derived from the
glycoprotein 100 (gp100) melanoma antigen,11 as a therapeutic cancer vaccine in combination with 2 different
doses of granulocyte-macrophage–colony stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. We hypothesized that the unique
properties of the peptide, which allowed binding to both
HLA class I and HLA class II, would yield greater immunization efficacy (helper T-cell support) and, thus, clinical benefit, and that the addition of GM-CSF would
enhance further the immunization efficacy of the peptide vaccine.12 Herein, we describe the results from the
clinical trial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peptide Vaccine
The MPS160 (GRAMLGTHTMEVTV) gp100175–189
peptide was synthesized under GMP by Multiple
Peptide Systems (San Diego, Calif). Unit doses (1000
lg/vial) were kept frozen (808C) until they were
used. The other 2 vaccine components included
incomplete Freund adjuvant (Montanide ISA-51; Seppic Inc. Fairfield, NJ) and GM-CSF (Berlex Inc, Seattle, Wash). Prior to each vaccine injection, all 3
components of the vaccine were thawed/reconstituted, combined, and administered subcutaneously
to the patients.
Clinical Protocol
A randomized Phase II clinical trial was conducted in
HLA-A2-positive patients who had stage IV melanoma. The objective of the study was to examine the
immunization efficacy of the MPS160 vaccine in ISA51 with 3 different doses of GM-CSF (0 lg, 75 lg,
and 100 lg). The trial was reviewed and approved by
the Mayo Foundation Institutional Review Board in
accordance with an assurance that was filed with
and approved by the Department of Health and
Human Services. All aspects of the protocol were
conducted in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki.

This trial enrolled patients aged 18 years of age
who had histologically proven, stage IV, malignant
melanoma. Key contradictions to study entry
included abnormal hematologic or blood chemistry
profile, poor performance status, recent other malignancies (<5 years), known central nervous system
metastases, known immune deficiency, and pregnant/lactating women.
After registration, patients were randomized to 1
of 3 vaccine protocols: arm A (MPS160 and ISA-51),
arm B (MPS160, ISA-51, and GM-CSF 75 lg), and
arm C (MPS160, ISA-51, and GM-CSF 100 lg). Each
protocol was administered subcutaneously on Day 1
of a 3-week, reimmunization cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression, excessive toxicity,
refusal, or a maximum of 9 immunizations. Treatment was discontinued if the patient developed significant toxicity (grade 2 allergic reaction, grade 3
nonhematologic toxicity, grade 2 neutropenia or
grade 3 thrombocytopenia).
Prior to each cycle of treatment, patients underwent a physical examination, toxicity assessment,
complete blood count, and serum chemistry profiling. Tumor assessment (according to the National
Cancer Institute Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors) was performed every 6 weeks. Immunologic
testing was performed prior to each cycle of treatment. Patients who discontinued treatment because
of toxicity, refusal, or other medical conditions were
followed for up to 2 years postregistration for progression or death.

Study
The primary objective of this study was to quantify
the impact of the addition of GM-CSF to the
MPS160/ISA-51 vaccine, which was determined by
calculating the maximum change in the frequency of
peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in
peripheral blood from pretreatment levels (tetramer
analysis). Secondary objectives included 1) toxicity
profile, 2) maximum changes in other baseline
immunologic parameters as a function of the different vaccine preparations, 3) tumor responses, and 4)
survival. Ten patients per treatment arm were to
be assigned randomly to each vaccination regimen
using a dynamic allocation procedure that balanced
the marginal distribution of type of dominant disease
(visceral vs nonvisceral) and HLA-DR53 or DQw6
positivity (yes vs no) between regimens. Enrollment
was to be suspended if 2 of the first 6 patients
accrued had a grade 4 toxicity that lasted 5 days or
a raise in serum creatinine to levels 2 times the
pretreatment level. All patients who fulfilled the elig-

Stage IV Melanoma Peptide Immunization/Melanoma Study Group and Celis

ibility criteria and received at least 1 immunization
were included in all analyses.
Tumor response rates was estimated based on
the number of eligible patients who achieved complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) on 2
consecutive evaluations at 6 weeks apart divided by
the total number of eligible patients enrolled. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time
from registration to documentation of disease progression. If a patient died without documentation of
progression, then he or she was considered to have
progressed on the date of his or her death. Overall
survival (OS) was defined as the time from registration to death from any cause. For each toxicity that
reportedly was at least possibly related to treatment,
the percentage of patients who reported any level of
severity was determined along with the percentage of
patients who reported a grade 3 level of severity.

Peripheral Blood Immune Monitoring
Immune response monitoring was performed using
peripheral blood collections that were obtained prior
to immunization and every 3 weeks while patients
were on study. One hundred milliliters of blood were
collected into heparinized tubes prior to each peptide vaccination. Immediately after collection, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
isolated and frozen in complement-inactivated fetal
calf serum (FCS) with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma,
St. Louis, Mo). To minimize interassay variability,
all individual patient samples were analyzed at the
same time. Immunophenotyping of PBMCs was
performed both for vaccine-specific (tetramers for
MPS160; Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, Calif ) and
other tumor-specific parameters (tetramers for
melanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells
[MART-1]27–35, gp100209–217, and tyrosinase368–376)
and for global parameters (lymphocyte subsets; Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) of immune function. For tetramer analysis, thawed PBMCs were
stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anticathespin D 8 (anti-CD8); PC5-conjugated
antihuman CD4, CD14, and CD19; and conjugated
HLA-A2 tetramers that contained peptides from
MPS160 (MLGTHTMEV), cytomegalovirus (CMV),
Epstein-Barr virus, MART-127–35, gp100209–217, and
tyrosinase368–376. Samples were analyzed by flow
cytometry, and data were processed using Cellquest
software (Becton-Dickinson). The interassay coefficient of variation (CV) for said tetramer staining
in our laboratory is consistently <5% (single-lot
reagents). Gates were set on lymphocytes that were
negative for CD4, CD14, and CD19 (PC5). In view of
the high interassay reproducibility of our tetramer

205

method (CV, <5%; data not shown), evidence of immunization was defined as at least doubling of the
frequency of tetramer-positive CTLs after immunization compared with patients who had preimmunization levels 0.05% or a frequency of tetramer-positive
CTLs 0.05% after immunization if preimmunization
levels were <0.05%.13 The interassay CV for said tetramer staining in our laboratory is consistently <5%
(single-lot reagents).
Immunophenotyping of immune cell subsets
(CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16/56, CD3/621, CD3/69, CD3/
212, CD4/25, CD8/25, CD4/45RA, CD4/45RO, CD8/
45RA, CD8/45RO, CD14/DR, CD20, CD80, CD86, and
CD4/FoxP3) was performed using FITC- or phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled monoclonal antibodies according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Becton-Dickinson).
Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using the
same software described above. A set of 20 normal
PBMC samples were used as controls. The normal
donors were buffy-coat preparations that were left
over after the processing of whole blood from healthy
blood donors (10 women) who donated blood for
clinical use in the Mayo Clinic Blood Bank. Data were
analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (see
below).

Functional CTL analysis
In patient samples that demonstrated increases in
tetramer frequencies to MPS160, we proceeded to ascertain the ability of the tetramer-specific CTLs to
synthesize interferon-g (IFN-g) upon stimulation
with cognate peptide presented in the context of
HLA-A2 and anti-CD28 costimulation. Details of
this method have been reported previously.14 In
brief, previously frozen patient PBMCs were thawed
in batches, labeled with PE-conjugated tetramers
(Beckman-Coulter), and stimulated for 6 hours in the
presence of 1 lg/mL brefeldin A, (Sigma Aldrich,
St. Louis, Mo) with pararamagnetic beads (Dynal,
Oslo, Norway) coated with peptide-loaded HLA-A2
(Beckman-Coulter) and mouse anti-human CD28
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn). After stimulation, the cells were fixed, permeablized, and stained
with antigen-presenting cell (APC)-conjugated mouse
antihuman CD8 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif)
and FITC-conjugated mouse antihuman IFN-g (R&D
Systems). The stained samples were fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan and Cellquest software; Becton-Dickinson). The interassay variability
for this method demonstrates a CV of <10%.

for the measurements of plasma concentrations of
IL-1b, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9,
IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, basic fibroblast

IFN-g, IFN-g-inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage-derived
inflammatory mediator 1a (MIP-1a), MIP-1b, platelet-derived growth factor, chemokine CCL5 (regulated
upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted
[RANTES]), tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The assay
was performed according to the manufacturer’s
directions. Briefly, 100 lL of Bio-Plex assay buffer
were added to each well of a MultiScreen MABVN
1.2-lm microfiltration plate followed by the addition
of 50 lL of the multiplex bead preparation. After
washing of the beads with the addition of 100 lL of
wash buffer, 50 lL the samples or the standards were
added to each well and incubated with shaking for
30 minutes at room temperature. The plasma (1:3
dilution) and standards were diluted using the BioPlex human serum diluent kit and plated in duplicate. Standard curves were generated with a mixture
of 27 cytokine standards and 8 serial dilutions ranging from 0 pg/mL to 32,000 pg/mL. Then, the plate
was washed 3 times followed by incubation of each
well in 25 lL of premixed detection antibodies for 30
minutes with shaking. The plate was washed again,
and 50 lL of streptavidin solution were added to
each well and incubated for 10 minutes at room
temperature with shaking. The beads were given a
final washing and resuspended in 125 lL of Bio-Plex
assay buffer. Cytokine levels in the sera were quantitated by analyzing 100 lL of each well on a Bio-Plex
using Bio-Plex Manager software, version 4.0. Normal
controls (plasma samples derived from blood donors
ranging in age from 31 years to 48 years) were generated by analyzing 11 samples of frozen plasma (from
5 women). Plasma was collected from the heparinized buffy-coat sample of the processed whole
blood. All donors were qualified blood donors, and
their other blood products were used for clinical
practice.
For each cytokine (except IL-1b) and lymphocyte
subset (see above), the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was
used to assess whether the distribution of its values
differed between the healthy volunteers and the
study patients. Because IL-1b was not detected in
any of the healthy volunteers, Fisher exact tests were
used to assess whether the proportion of individuals
with detectable levels of IL-1b differed between the
healthy volunteers and the study patients. A P value
.001 was considered significant. Differences in cytokine levels between the patients who were immu-

nized to against MPS160 and patients who were not
immunized were examined in an exploratory manner. For each cytokine, a patient’s value was classified
based on whether or not it fell in the 10th to 90th
range of the normal volunteer values. Then, the
Fisher exact test was used to assess whether the proportion of patients that fell within this range differed
by immunization status. RANTES was not considered
in these analyses, because many values were above
the upper limit of detection.

DC in vitro maturation assay
DCs from frozen PBMCs of healthy volunteers were
thawed, diluted to 2 3 106/mL, and cultured for
2 hours in RPMI 1640 (Meditech, Herndon, Va) and
10% FCS (Hyclone, Logan, Utah). The nonadherent
cells were removed, and more media was added supplemented with 50 ng/mL recombinant human GMCSF (Berlex, Richmond, Calif) and 10 ng/mL recombinant human IL-4 (Cell Sciences Canton, Mass). In
addition, 1% plasma from a healthy volunteer or
melanoma patient was added. The cells were cultured for 7 days with fresh media, cytokines, and
plasma added every 2 days. On Day 7, 10 ng/mL of
soluble CD40L (R&D Systems) were added to some
wells. On Day 8, all cells were harvested; stained
with anti-CD80, CD83, or CD86, and APC anti-CD11c
(Becton Dickenson); and analyzed by flow-cytometry
(FACScan and Cellquest; Becton Dickenson).

RESULTS
Clinical Outcomes
Enrollment on this study was opened in July 2002
and was closed in November 2005. Twenty-eight
HLA-A2-positive patients (Table 1) were enrolled,
including 10 patients who were randomized to arm
A, 9 patients who were randomized to arm B, and 9
patients who were randomized to arm C. No patient
was declared ineligible. Among the 28 eligible
patients, 24 patients (89%) had visceral-dominant
disease, and 10 patients were positive for HLA-DR53
or DQw6 (HLA class II alleles that restrict responses
to the MPS160 peptide).11
Treatment course and toxicity
The median number of treatment cycles administered was 2 (range, 1–9 cycles) in arm A, 2 (range,
1–6 cycles) in arm B, and 2 (range, 2–6 cycles) in
arm C. None of the patients discontinued treatment
because of toxicity. Grade 1 injection site reactions
were reported by 40% of the patients in arm A, by
22% of the patients in arm B, and by 56% of the
patients in arm C. Severe toxicities (grade 3) that

Clinical efficacy
At last follow-up, 1 patient was alive with stable disease 13.5 months after study entry, 3 patients were
alive with disease progression, and 24 patients had
died from progressive melanoma. There were no
objective tumor responses observed among the 28
patients who were enrolled onto this study. Twentyseven of these 28 patients had disease progression
documented within 135 days of registration (that is,
during the first 6 cycles of treatment). Only 4 patients
(2 patients in arm A, 1 patient in arm B, and 1 patient
in arm C) remained progression free for >100 days.
They all had M1c disease. The median PFS was 45
days in arm A, 42 days in arm B, and 63 days in arm C.
The median survival was 10 months in arm A, 6
months in arm B, and 9 months in arm C (Fig. 1).

men and at least 1 postimmunization blood specimen.
Evidence of immunization against MPS160 was
observed in 12 of these 21 patients (Fig. 2). All 4
patients who remained progression free beyond 100
days demonstrated evidence of immunization against
MPS160. Epitope spreading for other melanoma differentiation antigens (MART-127–35, gp100209–217, and/or
tyrosinase368–376) was observed in 10 of the 12 MPS160
patients. Spontaneous development of antimelanoma
differentiation antigen CTLs was observed in 5 of 9
patients who did not demonstrate anti-MPS160 CTL
immunity. The presence or absence of cognate HLA
class II antigens (DR53 or DQw6) did not appear to be
associated with immunization efficacy against MPS160
(data not shown). Likewise, the presence or absence of
GM-CSF in the vaccine preparation did not influence
the outcome of MPS160 immunization (6 of 9 patients
in arm A, 3 of 5 patients in arm B, and 3 of 7 patients in
arm C) or clinical benefit.

Immune Monitoring
Tetramer analysis
The principal metric of immunization efficacy was the
increase in vaccine-specific CTL frequency using the
tetramer method. Of the 28 accrued patients, 21
patients had at least 1 preimmunization blood speci-

Functional CTL analysis
In an effort to understand why only 4 of the immunized patients experienced any clinical benefit (PFS
>100 days), we proceeded to evaluate the functional
status (intracellular IFN-g production) of the tetramer-positive CTLs that were reactive to MPS160.

FIGURE 2. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) frequencies compared with melanoma-differentiation antigens. A tetramer assay was used to determine CTL frequencies against vaccine (MPS160) and melanoma-differentiation antigens (melanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells [MART-1]27–35, glycoprotein 100
[Gp100]209–217, and tyrosinase368–376) in 11 patients who demonstrated at least the doubling of CTL frequency to at least 1 antigen. Each color represents individual patient data.

To do this, we stimulated PBMCs from 9 patients
who demonstrated increased tetramer frequencies to
MPS160 with artificial APCs (aAPCs) carrying antiCD28 and either HLA-A2/gp100177–186 MLGTHTMEV
(the HLA-A2-cognant CTL epitope contained in
MPS160) peptide (test) or HLA-A2/irrelevant peptide
(control) complexes. After the 6-hour incubation, tetramer-positive CTLs were stained for intracellular
IFN-g and were analyzed by flow cytometry. Background IFN-g staining was subtracted (control) from
the measured (test) sample. The data are presented
as the percentage of CD8-positive T cells stained
with MPS160 tetramer with/without intracellular
IFN-g (Fig. 3A). Based on these data, it appears that
only a fraction of all tetramer-positive CTLs are capable of intracellular IFN-g production upon CTL
peptide stimulation, and their number seems to
decrease (or stay unchanged) during the course of
reimmunizations. Likewise, the number of tetramerpositive, IFN-g-nonproducing CTLs seems to
increase during the same period. These changes correlate with tumor progression, because the last analyzed time points occur at the time of significant
tumor growth (clinical progression). A similar pattern

of change was observed with a spontaneously processed tumor antigen, MART-1 (Fig. 3B). Thus, in the
immunized patients, the increase in tetramer-positive
CTLs as a result of repeated immunization may be
more a reflection of nonfunctional (tolerance) rather
than functional immunity. This phenomenon does
not appear to be restricted only to the peptide vaccine, because it also involves a nonvaccine, naturally
processed antimelanoma antigen (MART-1).

Global Immune Competence
Peripheral blood immune cell subsets in patients versus
normal controls
To gain a better understanding of the observed
increase in nonfunctional (non-IFN-g-producing)
anti-MPS160 and anti-MART1 reactive CTLs and
their apparent association with tumor growth, we analyzed the preimmunization baseline immune status
characteristics of the treated patients. We conducted
immunophenotyping analyses of PBMCs prior to immunization for both MPS160 immunized and nonimmunized patients based on tetramer criteria in
22 study patients compared with a set of 20 healthy
volunteers (Fig. 4). The distributions of CD16/56

(P < .001), CD3/69 (P < .001), CD86 (P < 0.001), and
CD80/86 (P < .001) differed between the groups, in
that the study patients tended to have higher values
of these subsets relative to the healthy volunteers.
The distributions of CD3/4 (P < .001), CD3/62L (P <
.001), CD4/25 (P < .001), and CD4/FoxP3 (P < .001)
also differed between the groups, in that the study
patients tended to have lower values of these subsets
relative to the healthy volunteers. Collectively, these
data appeared to suggest a state of global T-cell activation in the patients with melanoma.

Multiplex immunoassay
To gain a further understanding of the presumed
state of immune activation in the patients with melanoma, we analyzed the cytokine profiles of plasma
available on a limited number of study patients prior
to treatment (16 samples; 8 patients were immunized
against MPS160, and 1 patient lacked immunization
data) and 11 healthy volunteers. The proportion of
individuals with detectable levels of IL-1b tended to
be higher among patients than among the healthy
volunteers (10 of 16 patients vs 0 of 11 volunteers:
Fisher exact test; P 5 .001). The MCP-1 values tended
to be higher in patients than that in the volunteers
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; P 5 .004). For IL-1b and
IL-5, each patient was classified according to
whether they had some cytokine present. For each of
the remaining cytokines, each patient was classified
according to whether they had levels within the 10th
and 90th percentile (I10-90) of the healthy volunteers
(yes vs no). A higher proportion of patients who were
immunized against MPS160 tended to fall outside
the I10-90 range for IL-8 (4 of 8 patients vs 7 of 7
patients; P 5 .07), and IL-12 (4 of 8 patients vs 7 of 7
patients; P 5 .07). The data are summarized in
Table 2. Because of the small sample sizes, a more
sophisticated statistical analysis was not possible.
Patient plasma inhibits normal DC and CTL function in vitro
To address the impact of the plasma cytokine milieu
on immune cell function, we analyzed the impact of
patient plasma on the function of normal DCs and
CTLs as assessed by in vitro DC-maturation and
CTL-activation (aAPC) assays. The assays employed
normal donor DCs or CTLs that were incubated with
1% plasma derived from a patient with stage IV melanoma (or healthy controls). The data demonstrated
a significant reduction in the ability of DCs to
express costimulatory molecules after CD40L stimulation (Fig. 5) as well as a reduction in the ability of
CTLs to synthesize intracellular IFN-g after aAPC stimulation for CMV recall antigens (Fig. 6), suggesting
that the plasma cytokine milieu in the setting of

advanced melanoma was inhibitory to both DC and
CTL function. A more sophisticated analysis was not
possible because of limited sample availability. However, the available data set suggests that the inability
of patients with stage IV melanoma to mount effective CTL immunity to the peptide vaccine may be
caused at least in part by a global state of immune
dysfunction mediated in part by systemic cytokines.

DISCUSSION
In this report, we present the results from a randomized Phase II clinical trial that evaluated the immunologic and therapeutic outcomes of a novel peptide
vaccine, which demonstrated overlapping binding
sequences to HLA class I and class II molecules, for
the treatment of metastatic melanoma. The results
1) demonstrated no significant clinical benefit of the

immune response, their clinical benefit remains anecdotal.15 This discrepancy between immunization
efficacy and lack of therapeutic antitumor activity
has been rationalized as immune suppression/dysfunction of the tumor microenvironment.16 Descriptions of tolerized tumor-specific CTLs at the tumor
site with evidence of functional CTLs in the peripheral blood largely have contributed to the notion that
the major defect of T-cell function in cancer is limited to the tumor microenvironment.17 This is supported further by the observation of high-frequency,
circulating, tumor-specific CTLs in the face of progressing cancer in patients with melanoma who are
undergoing immunization with cancer vaccines.2 The
tumor microenvironment-mediated immune suppression appears to be mediated by: 1) tumorderived cytokines (eg, IL-10, IL-8, VEGF); 2) tumor
cell expression of immunosuppressive molecules
(eg, B7-H1)18–20; 3) immunosuppressive, tumor-associated macrophages21,22; and 4) tumor-associated
and circulating regulatory T cells (Treg).16 Unlike the
seemingly intact peripheral blood tumor-specific
CTLs, both tumor-associated and peripheral blood
DCs are decreased in number and function.21,23–30
The numbers of mature DCs in peripheral blood
from cancer patients appear to correlate indirectly
with tumor burden.31 After surgical resection, some
of the observed DC abnormalities seem to recover,
suggesting a direct role of the tumor on DC homeostasis.27 The observed abnormalities of DC function
have been correlated somewhat with plasma levels of

VEGF, but not IL6, IL10, or TGF-b.27 Such abnormalities in DC numbers/function may be responsible for
the lack of more effective CTL immune responses to
peptide vaccines.
The results of the current clinical trial are consistent with those from similar studies of advanced
melanoma in which the cancer vaccine seemed to
generate a measurable antivaccine immune response
with no significant clinical benefit. Expansion of the
laboratory analysis with the introduction of a new
method for the quantitation of intracellular IFN-g
production in tetramer positive CTLs suggested
emergence of peptide specific, non-IFN-g-producing
CTLs coincident with tumor progression, potentially
reflecting the emergence of immune tolerance. In an
effort to understand these findings, we hypothesized
that immunosuppressive cytokine mediators of the
enlarging tumor microenvironments may have spilled
over into systemic circulation, affecting systemic
immune competence. Plasma cytokine quantification
revealed that many patients had evidence of cytokine
overproduction. In vitro exposure of normal DCs and
CTLs to patient plasma predominantly (at times profoundly) was immunosuppressive. The 2 possible
sources of the overproduced plasma cytokines are
1) tumor cells, and/or 2) tumor-infiltrating immune
cells, or 3) prior therapy. To address these possibilities, we analyzed messenger RNA (mRNA) expression
profiles for cytokines/chemokines in 3 established
melanoma cell lines (data not shown). The data suggested that malignant melanocytes were capable of
transcribing a number of cytokine mRNAs, further
expanding on published reports indicating tumor
production of CCL2, IL-6, TNF-a, TGF-b, and IL8.22,32,33 Overproduction of these molecules (tumor
derived or infiltrating immune cell derived) and their
systemic dissemination may have dampened systemic immune function, facilitating tumor growth.
Thus, the failure of vaccines in the treatment of
advanced melanoma may be caused in part by a suppressive systemic plasma environment. It is possible
that high-dose cytokine therapy (eg, IL-2) and global
T-cell activation (eg, anti-CTLA4 therapy) transiently
may reset the systemic cytokine disorganization and
lead to clinical responses, some of which remain
durable. Likewise, early reports of successful adoptive
transfer studies infusing tumor-specific, autologous
CTLs into patients with systemic cancer after immunosuppressive chemotherapy (eg, fludarabine) may
have dampened the cytokine macroenvironment to
near normal levels, allowing effective tumor-specific
CTL function.34–36 Perhaps the existence of a normal
macroenvironment of an immunocompetent laboratory animal transplanted with a malignant tumor

Stage IV Melanoma Peptide Immunization/Melanoma Study Group and Celis

and subsequently treated with an immune modulator
(or vaccine) results in effective antitumor immune
responses and tumor regressing because of the lack of
systemic tumor-induced immune dysfunction. Likewise, the impact of prior radiation or chemotherapy
may have affected the immune/cytokine macroenvironment of the patients. In the current study, a number
of patients received prior chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, or immunotherapy (Table 1). Unfortunately,
because of the limited numbers of patients in each of
these subgroups, we were unable to analyze the impact
of prior therapy on the described parameters of
immune homeostasis.
In summary, the presented data illustrate the
development of possible peptide vaccine tolerance
concurrent with tumor progression in the setting of
advanced melanoma. The lack of effective systemic
immunization may result at least in part from a
dysfunctional (asynchronous) cytokine macroenvironment compromising basic functions of native
immune cells and resulting in effective immune
unresponsiveness. Further studies utilizing cancer
immunization strategies in the setting of metastatic
cancer should consider systemic immune dysfunction as a possible obstacle to measurable clinical
activity.
