BACKGROUND. Newer systemic therapies have significantly advanced the treatment of multiple myeloma, but additional agents are
needed. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor with efficacy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma that inhibits tumor angiogenesis,
a process that has been implicated in multiple myeloma pathogenesis. METHODS. In AMBER(‘‘A Randomized, Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter, Phase II Study of Bevacizumab in Combination With Bortezomib in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple
Myeloma’’), patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma were randomized to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8,
and 11 of each 21-day cycle) and either placebo or bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on day 1 of each cycle) for up to 8 cycles. At completion,
patients in the bortezomib-plus-bevacizumab arm could continue bevacizumab until they developed progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS. The stratified hazard ratio of PFS for the bevacizumab-containing arm (n ¼ 49) relative to the bortezomib monotherapy arm (n ¼ 53) was 0.743 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.431.28; P ¼ .2804); the median PFS was 6.2 months (95% CI, 4.4-8.5 months) and 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.2-7.2 months), respectively; the
overall response rates were 51% and 43.4% (P ¼ .4029), respectively; and the median response duration was 6.9 months (95% CI,
4.73-11.83 months) and 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.86-8.31 months), respectively. Frequent adverse events occurred at similar rates
across treatment arms, but hypertension, fatigue, and neuralgia occurred more frequently in the bevacizumab-containing arm.
CONCLUSIONS. The addition of bevacizumab to bortezomib in unselected patients with pretreated multiple myeloma did not result
in significant improvements in efficacy outcomes. The combination was well tolerated, and no new safety concerns for either agent

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder that accounts for approximately 86,000 cancer diagnoses
and approximately 63,000 deaths worldwide each year.1 The introduction of new therapeutic strategies, such as lenalidomide, that target malignant plasma cells to affect their interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment have changed
the management of MM and have improved survival rates.2-4 After initial treatment, however, patients with MM eventually relapse.5 Therapeutic strategies that offer prolonged survival are needed.
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor known to induce apoptosis, reverse drug resistance of MM cells, and block
cytokine effects, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis in the myeloma cell microenvironment, all of which support the proliferation and migration of neoplastic plasma cells.6 Bortezomib is active in and approved for patients with relapsed or refractory MM.7,8
Angiogenesis appears to be important in the pathogenesis of MM.9 Microvessel density, a surrogate marker for
angiogenesis within the bone marrow, is increased in patients with myeloma versus normal controls10 and has been correlated with increased disease activity and decreased survival.11 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an important
regulator of angiogenesis, has been implicated in pathologic angiogenesis associated with tumor growth.12 Preclinical
studies have demonstrated that the small-molecule VEGF inhibitors GW654652 and GW786034B (pazopanib) also
have activity against MM cells.13,14
Bevacizumab (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif), a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits VEGF
activity, was the first antiangiogenic therapy to be approved for patients with cancer. Combined with chemotherapy or

biologics, bevacizumab is associated with prolonged overall survival (OS) in phase 3 trials of metastatic colorectal15
and nonsmall cell lung16 cancers and with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in renal cancer17 versus placebo, chemotherapy, or biologic therapy alone.
Preliminary observations from a phase 2 trial of bevacizumab with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in
relapsed or refractory MM demonstrated response rates
10% greater than previously reported for a similar population that received lenalidomide and high-dose dexamethasone as well as a manageable safety profile.18
AMBER was designed to evaluate the clinical benefit
and tolerability of bevacizumab with bortezomib versus
bortezomib alone in patients with relapsed or refractory
MM. Efficacy and safety outcomes from this study are
reported herein.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

AMBER involved 36 centers in the United States and 2 in
Canada. Eligible patients were aged 18 years with
relapsed or refractory MM and an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status between 0
and 2. Patients had disease progression after 1 to 3 prior
treatment regimens as well as measurable disease, which
was defined as serum monoclonal (M) protein 1 g/dL
and urine M protein 200 mg/24 hours. Key disease-specific exclusion criteria included cytopenias, minimal laboratory values for renal and liver function, and the receipt
of other antimyeloma therapies within 21 days before the
initiation of study treatment. Key bevacizumab exclusion
340

criteria included a history of hypertensive crisis; uncontrolled hypertension; ongoing congestive heart failure or
decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction; a history of
myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack
within 6 months of study entry; bleeding; and significant
vascular disease.
All patients provided written, informed consent for
study participation in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. The appropriate local institutional review
boards approved the protocol.

Study Design and Treatment

AMBER was a blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter
phase 2 study that was designed to provide a preliminary
assessment of the safety and efficacy of bortezomib combined with bevacizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory MM. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to
receive bortezomib either with placebo or with bevacizumab. Randomization was stratified according to the number of prior treatments received (1 or >1) and the b2microglobulin level (<3.5 mg/L or 3.5 mg/L) (Fig. 1).
During the blinded bortezomib treatment phase,
patients received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2) as a bolus intravenous injection on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21-day
cycle with either placebo or bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously) after bortezomib treatment on the first day of
each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 8 cycles. Treatment
was administered until disease progression, unacceptable
toxicity, initiation of nonprotocol-specified antimyeloma
therapy, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred
first.

Results From AMBER/White et al

Patients and investigators, including the clinical
staff, the contract research organization, and Genentech
personnel who performed data review, were blinded to
the treatment arm while patients were in the blinded treatment phase. Treatment was unblinded after 8 cycles of
study treatment or upon investigator request because of
safety concerns if the patient discontinued the blinded
phase early. Patients in the placebo arm entered the postbortezomib phase of the study. Patients who were receiving bortezomib and bevacizumab continued on
bevacizumab monotherapy (15 mg/kg intravenously every
21 days) until they developed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity were assessed or until the initiation of
nonprotocol-specified antimyeloma therapy. Patients
who had received bortezomib and placebo in the blinded
phase were observed until they developed disease progression or any other reason for ending disease evaluation. After study completion, all patients were followed for
survival every 3 months until death, loss to follow-up,
patient withdrawal from survival follow-up, or study
termination.
Dose Modifications

Bevacizumab dose reductions were not permitted. Bortezomib was withheld at the onset of any grade 3 nonhematologic or grade 4 hematologic toxicity, excluding
neuropathy. Once the symptoms of the toxicity resolved,
bortezomib could be reinitiated with a dose reduction of
25% (eg, 1.3 mg/m2 reduced to 1.0 mg/m2). If any agent
(bortezomib or bevacizumab or placebo) was delayed
because of toxicity, then the remaining agent was continued according to the protocol. If bortezomib was discontinued because of toxicity, then patients were unblinded
and continued on open-label bevacizumab monotherapy.
Assessments

Clinical assessments included a complete physical examination (including neurologic assessment) and vital signs as
well as hematologic and urine laboratory evaluations on
day 1 of the blinded bortezomib treatment phase, during
the unblinded postbortezomib phase, and at the study
completion visit. Samples for serum and urine M protein
determination were acquired at the beginning of every 21day cycle for the first year on study and every 6 weeks
thereafter until disease progression. Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies were acquired at screening, to determine a complete response (CR) and were acquired
thereafter only with a change in clinical status. Full skeletal radiographs were acquired to evaluate new skeletal
symptoms on an annual basis until disease progression.
Cancer

Select adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were collected for all patients while on study and for up to 30 days
after the final dose of bevacizumab. All patients were
monitored for hypertension.
Outcome Measures

The primary endpoint was PFS, which we defined as the
time from randomization to disease progression or death
on study. Secondary endpoints included overall response
(defined as a stringent CR, a CR, a very good partial
response [VGPR], or a partial response [PR] determined
on 2 consecutive assessments 6 weeks apart and before
the initiation of any nonprotocol-specified antimyeloma
therapy), duration of response (the time from the initial
response to disease progression or death), OS (the time
from randomization to death from any cause, whether on
study treatment or after treatment discontinuation),
safety, and tolerability. Response, duration of response,
relapse, and progression were assessed by the investigating
physician according to International Myeloma Working
Group Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple
Myeloma.19
Statistical Analysis

The median PFS, duration of response, and OS for each
treatment arm were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to
estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for those outcomes except as otherwise noted.
The log-rank test was used for exploratory hypothesis tests
to assess the difference between treatment arms. The overall response rate (ORR) and 95% CI using the Blyth-StillCasella method were calculated, and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used for exploratory hypothesis testing on the difference between arms. All patients who had
received any study drug were included in the safety assessment, which included the incidence of protocol-specified
AEs graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3,
and other safety-related information.
Determination of Sample Size

It was expected that approximately 50 patients per treatment arm would be adequate to estimate the magnitude
of the treatment effect. Calculations were based on an
assumed median PFS of 6.2 months with bortezomib and
placebo and of 9.3 months with bortezomib and bevacizumab, yielding an HR of 0.67. Assuming that 35% of
randomized patients would discontinue treatment before
disease progression, approximately 50 PFS events would
have occurred in the combined treatment groups at the
time of final analysis. Assuming a standard error of the

completed 8 cycles. Twenty patients (40.8%) in the bevacizumab arm received at least 1 cycle of open-label bevacizumab (Table 2).
The median duration of follow-up for this analysis
was 13.3 months (range, 0.1-26.7 months). On the data
cutoff date of November 9, 2009, 45 patients (84.9%) in
the control arm and 38 patients (77.6%) in the bevacizumab-containing arm had discontinued the study. The
most frequent reasons given for study discontinuation
across both arms were disease progression (43.1%) and
initiation of nonprotocol-specified antimyeloma therapy
(11.8%).
By design, bevacizumab exposure was greater in the
bortezomib-plus-bevacizumab arm versus the bortezomib-plus-placebo arm; patients in the former arm continued on open-label bevacizumab after the blindedtreatment period. Twenty patients went on to receive bevacizumab in the open-label phase of the study; most had
discontinued therapy by the time of the analysis. The median duration of bevacizumab treatment for patients in
the bortezomib-plus-bevacizumab arm was 18.1 weeks
(range, 3-116 weeks).
Efficacy

All randomized patients were included in the efficacy
analysis regardless of the actual treatment received (Table
3). The stratified HR of PFS for the bortezomib-plus-bevacizumab arm relative to the bortezomib-plus-placebo
arm was 0.743 (95% CI, 0.43-1.28; log-rank P ¼ .2804).
The median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.2-7.2
months) in the placebo arm and 6.2 months (95% CI,
4.4-8.5 months) in the bevacizumab-containing arm (see
Table 3, Fig. 2).
Cancer

January 15, 2013

One patient in each arm achieved a CR. The percentage of PRs was similar across treatment arms. In total,
16.3% of patients in the bortezomib-plus-bevacizumab arm
and 7.5% of patients in the placebo-containing arm had a
VGPR. The observed ORR was 43.4% in the placebo-containing arm and 51% in the bevacizumab-containing arm
(95% CI for difference, 11.7% to 27%; P ¼ .4029).
The median response duration was 6.0 months
(95% CI, 4.9-8.3 months) in the placebo-containing arm
and 6.9 months (95% CI, 4.7-11.8 months) in the bevacizumab-containing arm. The stratified HR for responders
in the bevacizumab-containing arm relative to the placebo
arm was 0.956 (95% CI, 0.404-2.261).
At the time of data cutoff, in total, 21 study patients
had died (control arm, n ¼ 13; bevacizumab-containing
arm, n ¼ 8). The median OS was 24.0 months in the bortezomib-plus-placebo arm, whereas the median OS in the
bortezomib-plus-bevacizumab arm was not estimable
because there were too few observed events (see Table 3).
The estimated HR for OS in the bevacizumab-containing
arm relative to the placebo arm, based on a Cox proportional hazards regression model stratified by the number
of prior treatments (1 or >1) and baseline b2-microglobulin level (<3.5 mg/mL or 3.5 mg/L), was 0.633 (95%
CI, 0.258-1.552; log-rank test, P ¼ .3134).
Safety

All randomized patients who had received any study drug
were included in the safety analysis and grouped according to the treatment received. One patient in each treatment arm received no study treatment and was excluded
from the safety analysis. Two patients who were randomized to the bortezomib-plus-placebo arm received at least

Upper respiratory tract infection did not occur in >5% of patients in either treatment group.

bortezomib-plus-bevacizumab treatment arm reported
more anemia, neutropenia, fatigue, upper respiratory tract
infection, neuralgia, and hypertension. The rate of peripheral neuropathy was the same in each treatment group.
Fewer patients in the placebo-containing arm than
in the bevacizumab-containing arm reported at least 1
grade 3 AE. More grade 5 events were reported in the
bortezomib-plus-placebo arm than in the bortezomibplus-bevacizumab arm (see Table 4). Eight patients
(16%) who received bortezomib plus bevacizumab had
grade 3 events of hypertension; the bortezomib-plusplacebo arm reported none. No unexpected patterns of
laboratory abnormalities were noted.
DISCUSSION
The combination of bevacizumab and bortezomib therapy did not result in a significant increase in PFS in
patients with relapsed or refractory MM versus bortezomib alone (HR, 0.743; 95% CI, 0.43-1.28; P ¼ .2804).
Although the median PFS of 6.2 months in patients who
received with bevacizumab and bortezomib was consistent
with the time to progression reported in patients who
received single-agent bortezomib,7,8 there was a 1.1month difference in PFS in the bortezomib-plus-bevacizumab arm versus the bortezomib-plus-placebo control
arm. The data collected in this study were not mature to

reliably estimate OS benefit; and, in light of the results
reported here, poststudy data collection was discontinued.
The difference in ORR between arms (51% for bortezomib plus bevacizumab vs 43.4% for bortezomib plus
placebo) was not statistically significant (P ¼ .4029). The
rates of CRs and PRs were similar across treatment arms,
and the VGPR rate was 16.3% for patients who received
bortezomib plus bevacizumab and 7.5% for those who
received bortezomib plus placebo.
Safety outcomes were consistent with bortezomib
and bevacizumab use in other trials and indications.8,15-17
The addition of bevacizumab to bortezomib therapy did
not increase the incidence of thrombocytopenia, a common AE associated with bortezomib. Although it was generally well tolerated, bevacizumab, like other anti-VEGF
agents, has been associated with specific AEs, including
hypertension, which may be intensified or exacerbated by
concomitant administration of chemotherapeutic
agents.20
The reason for the lack of significant benefit with
the addition of bevacizumab to bortezomib therapy probably is multifactorial. It is believed that angiogenesis plays
a role in promoting tumor growth, and inhibiting the activity of VEGF with bevacizumab has demonstrated clinical benefit in some malignancies (eg, nonsmall cell lung
cancer). Suppressing angiogenesis alone may be

insufficient, however, because additional mechanisms and
pathways are involved in tumor growth.5 Consistent with
this possibility, studies of the single-agent tyrosine kinase
inhibitors SU5416 (semaxanib),21 ZD6474 (zactima),22
and GW786034 (pazopanib)23 in patients with relapsed
or refractory MM have failed to demonstrate significant
clinical benefit for these VEGF receptor-targeted agents.
Furthermore, angiogenesis inhibition, which reportedly is
effected in part through a reduction in tumor cell VEGF
secretion,24 is 1 of the multiple anticancer mechanisms
proposed for the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.25
Conceivably, further inhibition of this pathway may not
add further clinical benefit.
It is noteworthy that approximately 20% of
patients enrolled in this study had received bortezomib
previously. Possibly this patient population required
more extensive proteasome inhibition and/or the addition of dexamethasone to produce a greater tumor
response. Another phase 2 study of bevacizumab for
relapsed or refractory MM in which it was combined
with dexamethasone and lenalidomide has reported a
70% response rate with the combination, a nonsignificant improvement relative to the 61% response rate previously reported in patients who received lenalidomide
and high-dose dexamethasone.18 More recently, another
trial (N ¼ 12) in which patients with relapsed or refractory MM who had received prior thalidomide treatment
received bevacizumab monotherapy (n ¼ 3) and those
who had not received prior thalidomide treatment were
randomized to either bevacizumab monotherapy (n ¼ 3)
or bevacizumab with thalidomide (n ¼ 6) reported a
similar median time to treatment failure for patients
who received bevacizumab monotherapy and for those
who received the combination therapy. Those authors
concluded that future trials of anti-VEGF therapy in
MM should focus on patients whose myeloma cells are
enriched for VEGF expression.26 Thus, the results from
AMBER may reflect the unselected population of
patients with relapsed or refractory MM.
In summary, the addition of bevacizumab to bortezomib in an unselected, pretreated MM patient population did not result in a significant improvement in
bortezomib activity. This combination was well tolerated,
and no new safety concerns for either agent were identified. A greater understanding of the role played critical
factors, such as hypoxia, and by novel angiogenic pathways in myeloma angiogenesis, as well as the potential
identification of predictive biomarkers, will enable the development of more effective regimens and may further
improve outcomes for patients with MM.
