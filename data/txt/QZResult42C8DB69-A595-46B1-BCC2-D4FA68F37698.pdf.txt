Abstract
NORE1A (RASSF5) is a proapoptotic Ras effector that is
frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in human
tumors. It is structurally related to the RASSF1A tumor
suppressor and is itself implicated as a tumor suppressor. In
the presence of activated Ras, NORE1A is a potent inducer
of apoptosis. However, when expressed at lower levels in the
absence of activated Ras, NORE1A seems to promote cell
cycle arrest rather than apoptosis. The mechanisms underlying NORE1A action are poorly understood. We have used
microarray analysis of an inducible NORE1A system to
screen for physiologic signaling targets of NORE1A action.
Using this approach, we have identified several potential
signaling pathways modulated by NORE1A. In particular, we
identify the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1 as a
target for NORE1A activation and show that it is a vital
component of NORE1A-mediated growth inhibition. In
primary human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), loss of
NORE1A expression is frequent and correlates tightly with
loss of p21CIP1 expression. NORE1A down-regulation in HCC
also correlates with poor prognosis, enhanced proliferation,
survival, and angiogenic tumor characteristics. Experimental
inactivation of NORE1A results in the loss of p21CIP1
expression and promotes proliferation. The best characterized activator of p21CIP1 is the p53 master tumor suppressor. Further experiments showed that NORE1A activates
p21CIP1 via promoting p53 nuclear localization. Thus, we
define the molecular basis of NORE1A-mediated growth
inhibition and implicate NORE1A as a potential component
of the ill-defined connection between Ras and p53. [Cancer

Introduction
NORE1A (novel Ras effector 1 or RASSF5) is a member of the
RASSF family and is f50% identical to the relatively wellcharacterized RASSF1A tumor suppressor (1, 2). NORE1A is
frequently down-regulated by promoter methylation in human
tumors, and the NORE1A locus undergoes loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) in some primary tumors (1, 3). Furthermore, a translocation
involving NORE1A results in the manifestation of a hereditary
human cancer syndrome (4). Exogenous expression of NORE1A can
promote apoptosis (5, 6) or cell cycle arrest (7). Moreover,

restoration of endogenous levels of NORE1A expression to a
NORE1A-negative human tumor cell line blocks the tumorigenic
phenotype (5). Thus, NORE1A seems to function as a human tumor
suppressor, like the related RASSF1A (1, 2). However, the
mechanism of action of NORE1A is poorly understood and the
role of loss of NORE1A expression in tumor development has not
been characterized.
NORE1A contains a Ras Association (RA) domain and was
originally identified as a Ras binding protein in a two-hybrid screen
(8). It directly binds the Ras oncoprotein in a GTP-dependent
manner with an affinity comparable with that of other known Ras
effectors (9). Moreover, NORE1A forms an endogenous complex
with Ras in cells (6). Thus, NORE1A seems to be a bona fide Ras
effector, which is also a tumor suppressor.
Activated forms of Ras, while being highly transforming, can also
activate proapoptotic pathways (10). NORE1A has been identified
as one of the proapoptotic effectors of Ras and may function in
part by binding and activating the proapoptotic kinases MST1 and
MST2 (6). Thus, loss of NORE1A function may enhance the
transforming capacity of activated Ras by subverting its proapoptotic functions. This concept is supported by the observation that
high levels of Ras activity correlate with low levels of NORE1A
expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; ref. 11).
NORE1A promotes apoptosis when overexpressed or in the
presence of activated Ras, but lower levels of NORE1A expression
seem to promote G1 cell cycle arrest (7). The signaling pathways
involved in NORE1A function, with the exception of the MST
kinases (6), are completely unknown. In an attempt to determine
the mechanisms of action of NORE1A, we performed a microarray
analysis of kidney cells induced to express NORE1A at levels
comparable with those seen in cells that retain endogenous
NORE1A expression. Several alterations in gene expression that
would be compatible with the action of a tumor suppressor were
detected and validated by quantitative reverse transcription–PCR
(qRT-PCR). One of the most interesting was the induction of the
cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21CIP1. p21CIP1 has a
complicated role in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways
and can promote, apparently, contradictory biological activities
(12). However, overexpression of p21CIP1 induces G1 arrest (13), like
NORE1A. Moreover, p21 CIP1 knockout mice are tumor prone and
more sensitive to tumor induction by additional genetic lesions
(14). Thus, p21CIP1 is a good candidate target for a novel NORE1A
signaling pathway promoting G1 arrest.
Here, we show that NORE1A overexpression up-regulates p21CIP1
and that loss of NORE1A expression causes the reduction of p21CIP1
levels. We confirm that p21CIP1 is a key mediator of the growth
inhibitory properties of NORE1A. Moreover, in primary liver
tumors, loss of NORE1A expression correlated tightly with loss of
p21CIP1 expression and an enhanced proliferative index. Experimentally, we found that stable knockdown of NORE1A enhanced

Perhaps, the best-characterized activator of p21CIP1 is the master
tumor suppressor p53 (15). Using dominant negatives and small
interfering RNA (siRNA) against p53, we show that the activation of
p21CIP1 by NORE1A is p53 dependent. Although NORE1A

expression did not seem to affect the protein levels of p53, it did
seem to activate the nuclear translocation of p53 by an unknown
mechanism. Thus, we have identified multiple proteins implicated
in tumor suppression that are activated by near-physiologic levels
of NORE1A and identify NORE1A as a component of p53/p21CIP1
signaling pathways.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids. pIND/SP1-NORE1A has been described previously (4), as have
pCDNAFLAG and pZIP-NORE1A (5). HA-p53 wild-type and dominantnegative (16) expression plasmids were a generous gift of J. Isaacs (MUSC).
p53 siRNA was from Applied Biosystems (ID 2714). The NORE1A short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences used were 367:GGCTGCTCAAGAAGTTCATGGTTGTGGAC and 971:GCGACGTGAGGAGCATCTTCGAGCAGCCG.
Scram: CAGAAGATCGACAGCTACAACACGCGAGA cloned in the pRS
vector (Origene) have been described previously (11).
Tissue culture, transfections, and treatment. HEK-293ecr kidney
(Invitrogen), HCT116 colonic (generous gift, C. Deng, NIH), A549 non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), WRL68 hepatoblast, and FOCUS, HuH2, HuH6,
and HuH7 HCC (American Type Culture Collection) cell lines were grown in
DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum. NIH 3T3 cells were grown as described
previously (17). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000. NORE1A silencing experiments on FOCUS and WRL68 liver cell
lines were performed, as previously reported (11), and results obtained at
24 and 36 h after transfection with siRNA were analyzed. For demethylating
experiments, cell lines were plated and allowed 24-h growth before addition
of 10 Amol/L 5-aza-cytidine (5-Aza-C; Sigma). All experiments were
repeated at least thrice per each cell line.
Microarray analysis. HEK-293ecr cells were stably transfected with
vector or pIND/SP1 NORE1A, grown in triplicate, and induced with
5 Amol/L Ponasterone A for 48 h. Cells were lysed in Trizol, and extracted
RNA was subjected to microarray analysis as described in Supplementary
Materials and Methods. Differentially expressed genes between control

versus NORE1A-expressing cells were identified with a P < 0.05 being
considered statistically significant. qRT-PCR analysis was performed as
described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Tissue specimens, clinicopathologic data, methylation-specific PCR,

Western blots and immunoprecipitation. The following antibodies
were used: anti-p21CIP1 (Novus Biologicals); mouse monoclonal anti–cyclin
A, anti–cyclin E, rabbit polyclonal anti-CDK2, p53-D0-1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal anti-NORE1A (5); HA and FLAG antibodies (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were from Amersham. CDK2–cyclin A
and CDK2–cyclin E immunocomplexes were assessed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-CDK2 antibody and probing the membranes with either
the anti–cyclin A or anti–cyclin E antibody. Blots were developed using an
enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham. Nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts from HuH6 and HuH7 cell lines were prepared by using the NE-PER
nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.).
Antirabbit polyclonal antibodies against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and histone H3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to
ascertain equal loading of cytoplasmic and nuclear pools, respectively.

Figure 2. A, inhibition of NORE1A expression leads to reduced p21CIP1 expression and increased G1-S transition markers in human liver cell lines. WRL68 and

cycle arrest (7). The apoptotic properties of NORE1A are activated
by Ras and may be mediated via the MST1 and MST2 kinases (5, 6).
However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of NORE1A on the
cell cycle remain completely unknown. To address this question, we
performed microarray analysis of HEK-293ecr kidney cells induced
to express NORE1A. The Invitrogen pIND/SPI/293ecr system was
deliberately used to avoid artifacts due to excessive protein
expression generated by transient transfection studies. The pIND/
SPI plasmid system is induced by an insect hormone mimic,
Ponasterone A, which has minimal effects on mammalian gene
transcription.
From these assays, we identified several genes that showed
enhanced or reduced expression relative to the vector control
(Table 1). Three of the targets that exhibited the greatest
differential expression were subjected to qRT-PCR validation.
EEF2 and SAT1 were confirmed as being down-regulated, whereas
p21CIP1 was confirmed as being up-regulated (Fig. 1A). Induced
expression of NORE1A was confirmed by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 1B). NORE1A has previously been shown to induce G1 cell
cycle arrest (7). As p21CIP1 has also been shown to be capable of
this type of cell cycle arrest (13), we selected it for further study as a
potential NORE1A signaling pathway component.
NORE1A stimulates p21CIP1 protein expression. To confirm
that the microarray data reflected the effects of NORE1A on p21CIP1
protein expression, HEK-293ecr cells were transiently transfected
with NORE1A and the levels of endogenous p21CIP1 protein
measured after 24 hours. Western blotting revealed a dramatic

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

increase in the levels of p21CIP1 protein in the NORE1A transfected
cells (Fig. 1C). Further confirmation of the effects of NORE1A on
p21CIP1 expression was obtained by performing luciferase assays
with a p21-Luc reporter (18) and increasing amounts of NORE1A
expression plasmid (Fig. 1D).
NORE1A inhibition reduces p21CIP1 expression. If NORE1A
expression can enhance p21CIP1 levels, then inhibition of NORE1A
should reduce the levels of p21CIP1 protein. The FOCUS (HCC) and
WRL68 (hepatoblast) cell lines that retain NORE1A expression were
transfected with siRNA against NORE1A, and the reduction of
NORE1A protein expression was confirmed by Western blot
analysis. The same protein samples were then analyzed for
p21CIP1 expression (Fig. 2A). siRNA-mediated inhibition of NORE1A
expression caused a corresponding decrease in the expression of
p21CIP1. Furthermore, suppression of NORE1A resulted in upregulation of CDK2, whose activity is inhibited by p21CIP1. The
CDK2 showed enhanced activation in the NORE1A knockdown
cells, as measured by the presence of cyclin A and cyclin E in the
complex, as well as by kinase activity toward histone H1 (Fig. 2A).
These results support an enhanced G1-S transition after inactivation of NORE1A.
NORE1A inhibition leads to enhanced proliferation/loss of
contact inhibition of NIH3T3 cells. Several studies have
examined the effects of exogenous expression of NORE1A on the
suppression of cell growth/survival and the tumorigenic phenotype
(1). However, the biological consequences of NORE1A loss of
function have not been described experimentally. We used a

nontransformed murine cell line (NIH 3T3) as a model. Two
different shRNAs against murine NORE1A were used to generate
stable NIH3T3 cell lines knocked down for the expression of
endogenous NORE1A. A scrambled shRNA served as the control.
The cells were examined for the effects on proliferation by growth
curve analysis (Fig. 2B). In each case, the NORE1A shRNAtransfected cells showed modest growth enhancement but
pronounced loss of contact inhibition. Confirmation of NORE1A
knockdown was obtained by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2C).
Activation of p21CIP1 plays a vital role in NORE1A-mediated
growth/survival inhibition. Having determined that NORE1A
modulates p21CIP1, we sought to determine the importance of the
p21CIP1 activation in NORE1A-mediated suppression of growth and
survival. We transfected isogenic HCT116 cells that are (+) or ( ) for
p21 CIP1 (19) while retaining wild-type p53 with pZIP-NORE1A and
selected the cells in G418. Cells retaining p21CIP1 expression did not
survive the transfection with NORE1A. The p21CIP1 / cells showed
multiple colony formation when transfected with NORE1A, although
this was less than the cells transfected with vector (Fig. 3A).
Confirmation that the p21 / cells were expressing NORE1A protein
is shown in the adjacent panel. We then transfected HuH6 HCC
cells with a NORE1A expression plasmid in the absence (Fig. 3B, i)
or presence (Fig. 3B, ii) of a p21CIP1 siRNA and measured the effects
on proliferation. NORE1A inhibited proliferation, but this was
significantly reduced in the presence of the p21CIP1 siRNA.
Down-regulation of NORE1A expression correlates with
poor prognosis and loss of p21CIP1 expression in HCC. If

NORE1A plays an important role in the regulation of basal p21CIP1
levels in vivo, then we might expect to see a correlation between
the expression levels of NORE1A and p21CIP1 in primary tumors.
We analyzed samples from a panel of HCC tumors that were
classified as poor prognosis (HCCP; survival, <3 years after partial
liver resection) or better prognosis (HCCB; survival, >3 years).
Promoter hypermethylation of NORE1A was detected in 21 of 60
(35%) tumor samples (Fig. 4A), with no hypermethylation being
found in normal and surrounding nonneoplastic livers (data not
shown). Together with NORE1A promoter hypermethylation, 9 of
60 (15%) HCCs displayed LOH of the NORE1A locus. Importantly,
18 of 21 (85.7%) HCCs displaying promoter hypermethylation of
NORE1A were characterized by a poor prognosis (HCCP),
indicating that its down-regulation is a feature of HCC aggressiveness. Analysis of the HCCP panel for the relative levels of NORE1A
and p21CIP1 protein expression showed promoter methylation of
NORE1A correlated perfectly with reduced NORE1A expression
(Fig. 4A). Furthermore, a significant, direct correlation was found
between the levels of NORE1A and those of p21CIP1 in HCC by the
Pearson’s correlation test (r 2 = 0.6962, P < 0.001). These results were
further confirmed by qRT-PCR in pooled samples that were +/ for
NORE1A promoter methylation (Supplementary Fig. S1). In these
experiments, reduction of NORE1A expression also correlated with
increased EEF2 and SAT1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Thus, the microarray results are again predictive of the situation in
primary tumors. A representative Western blot of a panel of tumors
that were NORE1A nonmethylated and of good prognosis (HCCB)

Figure 4. A, loss of NORE1A expression correlates with loss of p21CIP1 expression and inversely with p53 mutation in human HCC. HCC samples were examined
for NORE1A promoter hypermethylation (HYP ) and LOH, as well as for NORE1A and p21CIP1 expression and p53 mutation. Tumors 1 to 35 are HCCP (survival,
<3 y). Tumors 36 to 60 are HCCB (survival, >3 y). Protein lysates were immunoblotted with NORE1A and p21CIP1 antibodies. In each case, Western blot analysis
revealed that NORE1A methylation corresponded with reduced NORE1A expression compared with normal liver and, in every case but one, reduced p21CIP1
expression. NORE1A inactivation and p53 mutation were mutually exclusive. B, representative Western blot analysis is shown. Actin serves as a loading control.

The tumor suppressor p53 is perhaps the best characterized
regulator of p21CIP1 (15). If the NORE1A methylated tumors were all
p53 mutant, then this might act as an alternative explanation of the
reduction in p21CIP1 expression. Intriguingly, our analysis of the p53
mutation status of the tumors showed a total mutual exclusion of
NORE1A promoter methylation/LOH and the mutation of p53
(Fig. 4A, bottom).

in human HCC, we evaluated the proliferation and apoptotic
indices and microvessel density in liver tumors with levels of
NORE1A comparable or lower than normal livers, respectively.
HCC with low levels of NORE1A displayed higher proliferation
(35.02 F 6.77 versus 21.87 F 6.33; P = 1.92  10 6) and lower
apoptotic index (1.03 F 0.49 versus 2.24 F 0.74; P = 8.19  10 8), as
well as higher microvessel density (303.79 F 58.14 versus 129.65 F
29.79; P = 3.03  10 15), when compared with HCC displaying
NORE1A levels comparable with normal livers. This resulted in a
significant shorter patient survival length for HCC with lower than
normal NORE1A levels (11.26 F 3.63 versus 51.60 F 19.77; P = 3.93 
10 6). Taken together, these data indicate that suppression of
NORE1A is associated with increased proliferation, reduced
apoptosis, and angiogenic properties of human liver tumors,
leading to a rapid, adverse outcome (Supplementary Table S2).

Epigenetic therapy restores NORE1A signaling pathways.
NORE1A is down-regulated by aberrant promoter methylation, and
this can be reversed by treating cells with the DNA methyltransferase inhibiting drug 5-Aza-C (5). To determine if such
treatment not only restores NORE1A expression but allows
reconstitution of NORE1A signaling pathways, we treated the
HuH2 HCC (Fig. 4C) and the A549 NSCLC (Fig. 4D) cell lines that
had suffered epigenetic inactivation of NORE1A (5)5 with 5-Aza-C.
We then examined the cells by Western blot for NORE1A and
p21CIP1 expression. 5-Aza-C not only increased NORE1A expression
but also increased the expression of p21CIP1 in both cell lines
(Fig. 4C and D).
NORE1A activates p21 CIP1 via the p53 tumor suppressor. The
best known activator of p21 CIP1 is the tumor suppressor p53 (15).
Activation of p21 CIP1 by p53 has been shown to play a key role in
the ability of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest (19). Consequently, we
performed experiments to determine if NORE1A was acting via
p53. First, we transfected two HCC cell lines, one wild type for p53
(HuH6) and one mutant for p53 (HuH7) with pCDNAFLAG
NORE1A and analyzed the two cell lines for the expression of
both NORE1A and p21CIP1 by Western blot. Figure 5A shows that
p21CIP1 was only activated in the p53 wild-type cell line, despite the
levels of transfected NORE1A expression being identical. Although

NORE1A Modulates p21CIP1 via p53

the p53 mutant cell line was defective for p21CIP1 activation, we did
not observe any apparent change in the levels of p53 protein
(second to bottom panel). To confirm a role for p53 in the action of
NORE1A, we transfected HEK-293ecr cells with NORE1A in the
presence of a p53 dominant-negative (generous gift from J. Isaacs,
MUSC) or p53 siRNA. Both inhibited the ability of NORE1A to
stimulate p21CIP1 protein expression (Fig. 5B).
Examination of the levels of p53 in NORE1A transfected cells
failed to show any obvious change (Fig. 5A). However, when we
fractionated NORE1A-transfected HuH6 and HuH7cells, we found
that the levels of endogenous p53 in the nucleus were increased
(Fig. 5C, i and ii) in the HuH6 cells (containing wild-type p53)
but not in the HuH7 cells (containing mutant p53). Nuclear
translocation of p53 is indicative of activation (20). Thus,
NORE1A seems to act via promoting the nuclear localization
of p53.

Discussion
NORE1A was originally identified as a Ras effector protein and
was subsequently shown to mediate some of the proapoptotic
functions of Ras (5, 6). NORE1A has no apparent enzymatic activity
and is hypothesized to function as a scaffolding molecule, as it has
been shown to bind the MST kinases and recruit them to the
plasma membrane in a complex with activated Ras (6). In the
absence of activated Ras, NORE1A expression can promote G1 cell
cycle arrest (7), but the mechanism of this action is not known.
Thus, NORE1A can modulate apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, and the
balance of these forces may be shifted toward apoptosis by the
interaction with Ras.

Several lines of evidence suggest that in addition to serving as a
Ras effector, NORE1A is also a tumor suppressor. Firstly, NORE1A
expression is frequently impaired in a variety of tumors,
particularly kidney, lung, and liver tumors (1). Secondly, restoration
of NORE1A expression to normal levels in a NORE1A-negative
tumor cell line blocks the ability of the cells to grow in soft agar (5).
Thirdly, loss of NORE1A function is implicated in the development
of a human hereditary cancer syndrome (4). Thus, NORE1A is
strongly implicated as an important human tumor suppressor with
a poorly understood mode of action.
To gain a better understanding of the function of NORE1A, we
performed a microarray analysis to identify transcriptional
alterations associated with the expression of NORE1A. In an
attempt to maximize physiologic relevance, we used a kidney cell
system stably transfected with an inducible form of NORE1A.
Kidney tumors are the most frequently associated with NORE1A
down-regulation (1), and the inducible system allowed us to
control the expression levels of NORE1A, avoiding potential
artifacts due to massive overexpression.
A series of transcriptional alterations due to NORE1A induction
were observed. Three genes that showed some of the strongest
changes in the microarray assay were subjected to quantification
by qRT-PCR. These experiments confirmed that NORE1A expression induced decreases in EEF2 and SAT1 and an increase in
p21 CIP1 expression. Further analysis showed that in primary HCC,
NORE1A expression correlated with p21CIP1 and inversely correlated with EEF2 and SAT1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1).
EEF2 is a translation factor that mediates ribosomal translocation during peptide chain elongation and is activated by mitogenic
stimuli (21). EEF2 is overexpressed in many tumors and seems to

Figure 5. NORE1A activates p21CIP1 protein expression via p53. A, HuH6 (p53 wild type; H6) and HuH7 (p53 mutant; H7 ) human HCC cell lines were transfected with
pCDNAFLAG NORE1A, and the expression of NORE1A and p21CIP1 protein was determined by Western blot. NORE1A induced p21CIP1 only in the p53 wild-type
cell line, whereas the total levels of p53 did not change in both cell lines. B, Hek-293 cells were transfected with NORE1A in the presence or absence of p53siRNA or a
p53 dominant-negative construct. An HA-tagged p53 expression vector serves as a positive control. siRNA to p53 or the p53 dominant-negative inhibited NORE1A
induced p21CIP1 expression. C, NORE1A induces nuclear translocation of wild-type p53. HuH6 (p53 wild type; H6 ) and HuH7 (p53 mutant; H7 ) HCC cell lines were
transiently transfected with pCDNAFLAG NORE1A and fractionated into cytoplasmic (i) and nuclear (ii ) fractions before Western blotting for p53. NORE1A had
no effect on p53 levels in HuH7 cells, but it promoted progressive nuclear accumulation of p53 in HuH6 cells.

play an important role in rendering tumor cells resistant to the
translation suppressing effects of hypoxia (22). Resistance to
hypoxia is believed to play a critical role in the development of
many tumors (23).
SAT1 is a spermidine kinase that plays a key role in the
regulation of the intracellular levels of polyamines (24). Polyamines
play an important role in neoplastic growth, and polyamine
synthesis inhibitors are of interest as chemopreventive agents (25).
Activated K-Ras, like NORE1A, inhibits SAT1 expression (25).
Moreover, the related SAT2 has been implicated in the regulation of
HIF-1a, a key component of the cellular response to hypoxia and
an important component of the development of kidney cancer and
HCC progression (26).
Previously, microarray analysis has been performed to determine
the signaling profile of RASSF1A (27). RASSF1A is 50% identical to
NORE1A, but the two proteins seem to promote quite different
alterations in gene expression. SAT1 was the only target identified
by both RASSF1A and NORE1A. This confirms that the functions of
NORE1A and RASSF1A, while overlapping, are likely to be quite
distinct.
Several other up-regulated targets identified in the array have also
been associated with cell death and growth suppression. Among
them, BTG3 is a putative tumor suppressor and target of p53 itself (28),
and PDCD2 has been implicated in apoptosis (29) and proliferation
control (30). Moreover, RAB32 down-regulation has been associated
with colon cancer (31). Thus, NORE1A promotes a number of
alterations in transcription that might be expected to repress
transformation. Further work will be required to validate these
targets and assess their role in NORE1A signaling.
The original purpose of initiating these experiments was to
attempt to understand the basis of the nonapoptotic growth
inhibition we had observed with relatively low levels of NORE1A
expression. Consequently, the most interesting effect of NORE1A
that we detected was the activation of transcription of the p21CIP1
cdk inhibitor.
Cell homeostasis is normally maintained by a complex, coordinated network of signaling pathways that balances proliferation,
growth arrest, differentiation, and cell death. Errors in this balance
can lead to the development of neoplasia. Correct regulation of the
cell cycle is a key component of maintaining the homeostatic
balance. Cell cycle regulation is mediated by cdks, and cdks are
regulated, in part, by cdk inhibitors, such as p21CIP1 (32). p21CIP1
controls cell cycle progression through G1-S at several levels (33).
p21CIP1 has also been shown to induce resistance to apoptotic
stimuli, such as DNA damage. The mechanism of this effect may be
to delay the cell in G1 while DNA repair is affected. However, the
role of p21CIP1 in the modulation of apoptosis is complex, and
under some circumstances, p21CIP1 may exhibit proapoptotic
functions (34, 35). p21CIP1 has also been identified as playing a
key role in the induction of terminal differentiation and senescence
(32, 36). Thus, p21CIP1 plays a complex and, at times, apparently
contradictory role in modulating cellular behavior and survival.
However, on the whole, loss of p21CIP1 expression seems to
promote transformation. In primary human tumors, loss of p21CIP1
protein expression has been correlated with poor prognosis (37).
Moreover, the inactivation of p21CIP1 in transgenic mice is,
eventually, tumorigenic and enhances the transforming effects of
other genetic lesions, including activated Ras (14, 38, 39). Therefore,
p21CIP1 seems to serve as a tumor suppressor.
The ability of NORE1A to activate p21CIP1 explains the ability
of NORE1A to induce G1 cell cycle arrest (7), as p21CIP1 blocks

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

the cell cycle at G1 by inhibiting cdk2 (32). Conversely, loss of
NORE1A expression reduces p21CIP1 expression and enhances cdk2
activity. We also observed an increase in cdk2 protein levels,
although this target was not identified in the microarray. Both
effects could contribute to a large increase in kinase activity of the
cdk2 kinase complex precipitated from the knockdown cells. The
importance of p21CIP1 activation to NORE1A-mediated growth
inhibition was confirmed by our observation that loss of p21CIP1
from the cell system impaired the growth/survival inhibitory
effects of NORE1A.
NORE1A expression is often down-regulated in human tumors (1).
Our siRNA experiments in cells lines suggested that cells require
NORE1A for normal p21CIP1 expression. Examination of a panel of
primary HCC showed that loss of NORE1A expression correlated
closely with down-regulation of p21CIP1 expression. Preliminary data
from our group show a similar pattern in a small collection of human
renal, lung, and colorectal carcinomas (data not shown). These
findings suggest a physiologic link between NORE1A and p21CIP1 in
tumors. Loss of NORE1A and p21CIP1 expression also strongly
correlated with poorer prognosis of HCC, and this may identify
NORE1A as a good target for epigenetic therapy. Experimental
restoration of NORE1A expression by demethylating drugs was
successful in increasing p21CIP1 expression. This confirms the ability of
these drugs to restore pathway function, not just NORE1A expression.
As the p53 tumor suppressor is the best characterized regulator
of p21 CIP1 (40, 41), we examined the role of p53 in NORE1A
mediated p21 CIP1 activation. Dominant-negative and siRNA
reagents showed that p53 was necessary for NORE1A to activate
p21 CIP1. Moreover, NORE1A could only activate p21 CIP1 in a wildtype p53-containing tumor cell line. p53 seems to be the most
important tumor suppressor yet identified in human cancer with
over 50% of all primary tumors showing defective p53 function (42).
Thus, NORE1A participates in the modulation of what may be
considered the major human tumor suppressor pathway. This
conclusion is supported by the observation that, in primary human
HCC s, the mutation of p53 and the inactivation of NORE1A are
mutually exclusive.
The mechanism by which NORE1A can modulate p53 remains
unknown. We have not detected NORE1A in complex with p53 nor
have we observed changes in p53 protein levels due to NORE1A.
However, we did observe an increase in the fraction of p53 present
in the nucleus in NORE1A-transfected cells. This suggests to us that
NORE1A is promoting the nuclear localization of p53 via some
posttranslational modification, such as phosphorylation or acetylation (43). We are currently examining which, if any, modifications
of p53 are affected by NORE1A.
Although NORE1A is frequently down-regulated in primary
human tumors, the biological effects of inhibiting NORE1A function
have not been determined. To identify the effects of NORE1A loss
of function on nontransformed p53 wild-type cells, we transfected
NIH 3T3 cells with two different NORE1A shRNAs to make stable
knockdown cell lines. The cells showed an enhanced rate of growth,
but also a noticeable reduction in contact inhibition, and continued
to proliferate after the scrambled shRNA transfected cells had
arrested. We have recently shown that defects in p53 function
can lead to loss of contact inhibition in NIH 3T3 cells (44), so
inactivation of NORE1A may have a similar effect via p53.
Thus, we identify a novel signaling pathway for NORE1A,
connecting it to p53 and hence to the p21CIP1 cdk inhibitor. This
may help explain the frequency with which NORE1A is inactivated in
primary human tumors and why NORE1A and p53 inactivation is
