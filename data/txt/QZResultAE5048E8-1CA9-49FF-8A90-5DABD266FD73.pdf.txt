Nuclear Alternate Estrogen Receptor GPR30 Mediates
17β-Estradiol–Induced Gene Expression and Migration
in Breast Cancer–Associated Fibroblasts
Antonio Madeo and Marcello Maggiolini

Abstract
Fibroblasts are the principal cellular component of connective tissue and are associated with cancer cells at
all stages of tumor progression. Structural and functional contributions of fibroblasts to the growth, survival,
and invasive capacity of cancer cells are beginning to emerge. In breast carcinoma, ∼80% of stromal fibroblasts termed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are thought to manifest an activated phenotype that promotes cancer cell proliferation tumor growth at metastatic sites similar to the primary tumor. In this report,
we show that CAFs respond to physiologic concentrations of 17β-estradiol (E2) by rapidly inducing extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and immediate early gene expression, including c-fos and connective tissue growth factor, and cyclin D1. Notably, the E2 response is mediated by the alternate estrogen
receptor GPR30, which interfaces with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. In
particular, E2 stimulates a physical interaction between GPR30 and phosphorylated EGFR, recruiting them
to the cyclin D1 gene promoter. Nuclear localization induced by E2 was confirmed by cellular immunofluorescence methods. GPR30 was required for CAF proliferation and migration induced by E2. Our results provide
important new mechanistic insights into how CAFs are stimulated by estrogen through a GPR30-mediated
nuclear signaling pathway. More generally, they define estrogenic GPR30 signaling as a functionally important
component of the tumor microenvironment. Cancer Res; 70(14); 6036–46. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Fibroblasts are the principal cellular component of the
connective tissue (1). Similar to organ fibrosis, fibroblasts
surrounding tumors remain always activated, playing a
prominent role in defining the rate and extent of cancer progression such as in breast tumor (1, 2). The deletion of type II
transforming growth factor β receptor in fibroblasts of mice
(3) and carcinogen treatment of mammary fat pad stroma in
rats (4) promote tumor initiation and progression, suggesting
the important role elicited by stromal-derived factors in
tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in xenograft models of breast
cancer, coinjection of various fibroblasts or mesenchimal
stem cells with cancer cells stimulates tumor growth and
metastasis (5). Indeed, in human breast tumors, a “woundresponse” gene expression signature characteristic of activated fibroblasts was predictive of the risk of metastasis and
shorter survival (6), highlighting the contribution of the microAuthors' Affiliation: Department of Pharmaco-Biology, University of

environment in tumor progression. Accumulated evidence
has indicated that cancer cells actively recruit fibroblasts into
the tumor mass (7), in particular, the subpopulation named
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF; ref. 1). In breast carcinoma, ∼80% of stromal fibroblasts may acquire the activated
phenotype that promotes the proliferation of cancer cells at
the metastatic sites, stimulating tumor growth such as the
primary tumor (1).
Activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has
been mainly implicated in proliferation, migration, and invasion of fibroblasts (8). Although the transduction pathways
connecting EGFR-mediated events from cell surface to nuclear transcription remain to be fully elucidated, in EGFR
(−/−) mouse embryonal fibroblasts, the extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK)/c-Fos (and activator protein) signaling
was shown to be a downstream effectors of the EGFRmediated matrix metalloproteinase expression and collagen
contraction in fibroblasts (8). Furthermore, emerging evidence
suggest that EGFR signaling can involve its transport from the
cell surface to the nucleus and the association with AT-rich
consensus sequence-dependent transcription, including the
cyclin D1 promoter sequence (9). In this regard, it has been
shown that the juxtamembrane region of EGFR harbors a putative nuclear localization signal with three clusters of basic
amino acids (RRRHIVRKRTLRR, amino acids 645–657) mediating the receptor localization at the nuclear level (10). Although the nature and pathologic consequences of the EGFR
pathway within the nucleus remain elusive, accumulating data

Nuclear GPR30 Mediates 17β-Estradiol Action in CAFs

suggest its potential role in increased tumor cell proliferation
and poor survival rate in breast cancer patients (11, 12).
Stromal fibroblasts actively induce the local production
of estrogens, which largely contribute to the genesis and
progression of breast carcinomas through a signal cross-talk
with diverse growth factor transduction pathways (2, 13).
Although the physiologic responses to estrogens are mainly
mediated by the estrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ (14), in
the last few years, GPR30 has been shown to mediate estrogen signaling in a wide variety of cell types (15–23). Moreover, in a previous extensive survey, GPR30 was found to be
highly expressed and significantly associated with tumor
size (>2 cm), with the presence of distant metastases and
increased human EGFR-2 (HER-2)/neu expression (24).
Likewise, in a recent study performed in the aggressive
inflammatory breast cancer, the majority of tumors were
GPR30 positive (25), indicating that GPR30 expression
may be considered a predictor of an aggressive disease.
Recently, we have found that one of the strongest genes
induced through GPR30, such as CTGF, is required for both
proliferation and migration in ER-negative SkBr3 breast
cancer cells (26). Although elevated CTGF levels characterized diverse types of carcinomas (27–29) and were associated
with aggressive behavior of breast cancer cell lines (30, 31), a
lower CTGF expression was found in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues in a survey of 122 human breast
tumors (32).
In the present study, we show that GPR30 mediates in
CAFs rapid ERK activation, gene expression changes, and
the migration induced by a physiologic concentration
(1 nmol/L) of 17β-estradiol (E2). Moreover, we show that
E2 stimulates the physical interaction between GPR30 and
pEGFR, and their recruitment to the cyclin D1 promoter sequence. Notably, we provide the first evidence concerning the
nuclear localization of GPR30, opening new perspectives into
a better understanding of its role in cancer progression.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
SkBr3 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were maintained in
RPMI 1640 without phenol red and DMEM-F12 with phenol
red, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS). LNCaP prostate cancer cells were maintained in RPMI
1640 with phenol red and supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells
were switched to medium without serum the day before
experiments.
Isolation, cultivation, and characterization of CAFs
CAFs were extracted from six invasive mammary ductal carcinomas obtained from mastectomies. In each patient, a
second population of fibroblasts was isolated from a noncancerous breast tissue at least 2 cm from the outer tumor margin. CAFs and fibroblasts were isolated by tissue dissociation
followed by differential sedimentation, plating, and growth in
high-serum media conditions, which select for fibroblast
growth (26, 33). CAFs and fibroblasts were then expanded into
two 15-cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for two to

three population doublings within total 7 to 10 days after tissue dissociation. Thereafter, we verified by immunostaining
the purity of the various fibroblast populations that strongly
expressed the fibroblastic marker vimentin (Fig. 1B) but not
cytokeratin (data not shown). We used CAFs and fibroblasts
passaged for up to five population doublings for subsequent
experiments, to minimize clonal selection and culture stress,
which could occur during extended tissue culture. The investigation was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from the patients.
Drugs and chemicals
17β-Estradiol (E2) and PD 98059 (PD) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., and 1-[4-(-6-bromobenzol[1,3]
diodo-5-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahidro3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolin8yl]-ethanone (G-1) was bought from Merck KGaA. All compounds were solubilized in DMSO, except for E2, which was
solubilized in ethanol.
Plasmids
Firefly luciferase reporter plasmid used was XETL (EREluc) for ERα, and the plasmid HEG0 was used to express
ERα (34). As an internal transfection control, we cotransfected the plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) that expresses Renilla
Luciferase. The short hairpin RNA (shRNA) construct to
knock down the expression of GPR30 and the unrelated
shRNA control construct have been previously described
(17). The SureSilencing shEGFR and negative control plasmid (shRNA) were purchased from SABioscience Corp. and
were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The luciferase reporter plasmid for cyclin D1 (cyclin
D1-luc) with two ATRSs located in the proximal region of
the promoter between nucleotides −74 and −70 (TTTAT),
and −31 and −27 (TTTGT), respectively, containing 163 bp
was used along with the cyclin D1 reporter mutated in the
two ATRS sites [cyclin D1-luc(m); kind gifts of Dr. RG Pestell
(Kimmel Cancer Center, Department of Cancer Biology and
Jefferson Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Center,
Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA)]. As an internal transfection control, we cotransfected the plasmid pRLTK (Promega).
Immunoblotting
All cell lines were grown in 10-cm dishes, exposed to treatments, and then lysed as previously described (26). GPR30 was
revealed using the rabbit polyclonal antiserum LS-A4271
(MBL-Eppendorf). ERα (COOH-terminal domains, F-10),
EGFR, pEGFRTyr1173, c-Fos, CTGF, cyclin D1, p-ERK 1/2, ERK
2, and β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
and ERβ was from Serotec. The secondary antibodies for
chemiluminescence detection were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. For GPR30 and EGFR silencing, cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes, then transiently transfected in serumfree medium for 24 hours before treatments with 5 μg/plate
short hairpin GPR30 (shGPR30) or short hairpin EGFR
(shEGFR) or with the control empty vector (control shRNA).
Transfections were performed using Fugene 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics).

Reverse transcription and real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol commercial kit
(Invitrogen), and reverse transcription was performed as
previously described (26). Gene-specific primers were designed using the Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied
Biosystems, Inc.). For c-fos, CTGF, cyclin D1, and the ribosomal protein 18S, which was used as a control gene to obtain
normalized values, the primers were 5′-CGAGCCCTTTGATGACTTCCT-3′ (c-fos forward), 5′-GGAGCGGGCTGTCTCAGA-3′ (c-fos reverse), 5′-ACCTGTGGGATGGGCATCT-3′
(CTGF forward), 5′-CAGGCGGCTCTCTGCTTCTCTA-3′

and 5′-GGGCATCACAGACCTGTTAT-3′ (18S reverse).
Cellular fractionation and immunoprecipitation assay
After stimulation with 1 nmol/L E2 for 15 minutes, CAFs
were washed with PBS and cellular fractionation was performed as previously described (9). Protein concentrations
were determined using the Bradford method, then equal
amounts of nonnuclear (cytosolic) or nuclear fractions

were incubated overnight with immunoprecipitation buffer
with protease inhibitors, 2 μg of GPR30 or pEGFRTyr1173
antibody (1:1,000), and 20 μL of protein A/G agarose
immunoprecipitation reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
To pellet beads, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm
for 5 minutes at 4°C. Thereafter, pellets were washed four
time with 500 μL of PBS and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for
5 minutes at 4°C. The washed immunoprecipitates were
subjected to SDS page and Western blot analyses using
the anti-GPR30 antibody and pEGFRTyr1173.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Primary fibroblast cells were grown in 10-cm dishes to 70%
to 80% confluence, shifted to serum-free medium for 24 hours,
and then treated with vehicle or 1 nmol/L E2 for 1 hour. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as
previously described (19). Specific sequences of cyclin D1 promoter in the immunoprecipitates were detected by PCR with
primers forward (5′-GAGGGGACTAATATTTCCAGCAA-3′)
and reverse (5′-TAAAGGGATTTCAGCTTAGCA-3′). For
GPR30 or EGFR silencing experiments, cells were plated in

fection was renewed every day for an additional 48 hours.
Cell growth was monitored by MTT assay according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.).

Transfection and luciferase assay
Fibroblast cells (1 × 105) were plated in 24-well dishes with
500 μL of 5% charcoal-stripped FBS per well and then transfected after 1 hour using Fugene 6 reagent as recommended
by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) with a mixture containing 200 ng of ERα promoter plasmid, 500 ng of ERE-luc
reporter gene and 10 ng of pRL-TK, or with a mixture 500 ng
of cyclin D1-luc or cyclin D1-luc(m) and 10 ng of pRL-TK.
After 18 hours, 1 mL of medium with that lacking serum
and treatments was added to wells, and then cells were incubated for an additional 24 hours. Luciferase activity was
measured with the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega) according
to the manufacturer's recommendations. Firefly luciferase
values were normalized to the internal transfection control
provided by the Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized
relative light unit values obtained from cells treated with vehicle were set as 1-fold induction upon which the activity induced by treatments was calculated.

Would-healing assay
Twelve-well plates were coated with 500 μL fibronectin
0.5% in gelatin for 2 hours at 37°C. Fibronectin was removed
and then added 500 μL of 2 mg mL−1 bovine serum albumin
for 1 hour at 37°C to block coated wells. Then, multiwall
plates were washed once with PBS and refilled with 1 mL
of cells in regular growth medium (20% FBS). When at 70%
to 80% confluency, the cells were transfected with shGPR30
using Fugene 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer for 24 hours. Transfected cells were washed once and
replaced with 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS and then treated.
Next, to create a scratch of the cell monolayer, a p200 pipette
tip was used. The migration assay was evaluated after
48 hours of treatment.

Cells were seeded in two-well Lab-Tek II chamber slides at
a density of 1 × 105 per well and incubated for 24 hours in the
corresponding maintenance media. Cells were transiently
transfected in FBS 5% for 12 hours with a control shRNA
or the shGPR30 expression vector, using Fugene 6 reagent
as recommended by the manufacturer. For immunofluorescence staining, cultured fibroblast cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde; permeabilized with 0.1% TWEEN three
times for 5 minutes; then were blocked for 30 minutes at
room temperature with PBS containing 10% normal donkey
serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 0.1% Triton X-100, and
0.05% TWEEN. After incubation overnight at 4°C with a primary antibody against vimentin (R28; 1:250; Cell Signaling),
GPR30 LS-A4271 (1:1,000; MBL-Eppendorf), pEGFRTyr1173

Results
CAFs express GPR30 but not ERs
According to a previous investigation (33), CAFs (Fig. 1A)
were obtained from human invasive mammary ductal carcinomas, as assessed by immunostaining (Fig. 1B). Thereafter,
we ascertained that CAFs used in our experimental model
lack ERα and ERβ but express GPR30 and EGFR (Fig. 1C),
which is one of the major player of the GPR30-mediated action in tumor cells (15, 19). Moreover, we determined by reverse transcription-PCR that these cells do not express the
small isoform of ERα, which was recently involved in
GPR30 signaling (data not shown; ref. 35). Next, transfecting
CAFs with the ER reporter plasmid, the transcriptional
response to E2 was observed only cotransfecting the ERα expression plasmid (Fig. 1D).
GPR30 mediates the ERK phosphorylation and gene
expression induced by E2
Considering that in our and other previous reports E2
was able to trigger rapid ERK activation through the
GPR30/EGFR signaling (15), we performed dose-response
and time course studies to assess whether ERK might be
activated by E2 in CAFs and fibroblasts obtained from normal breast tissues. Of note, even a physiologic concentration of E2 (1 nmol/L) was able to strongly induce in CAF
ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A and B), which was abolished
in presence of the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase
(Mek) inhibitor PD (Supplementary Fig. S1). Conversely, only
a slight ERK activation by E2 was observed in fibroblasts
obtained from normal breast tissues (Supplementary Fig.
S2), indicating that the ERK response to E2 may represent
a peculiar feature of CAFs. Interestingly, the ERK phosphorylation triggered by 1 nmol/L of E2 and by 1 μmol/L of the

selective GPR30 agonist G-1 (36) was inhibited in CAFs
knocking down either GPR30 (Fig. 2C) or EGFR expression
(Fig. 2D), suggesting that both receptors are involved in the
response to E2 and G-1. Moreover, 1 nmol/L of E2 and
1 μmol/L of G-1 induced in CAFs (Fig. 3A and B), but
not in fibroblasts obtained from normal breast tissues (data
not shown), the mRNA and protein expression of c-fos,
CTGF, and cyclin D1. Silencing GPR30 or EGFR, the upregulation of these GPR30 target genes was abolished, as also
observed using the ERK inhibitor PD (Fig. 3B–D). Altogether, these data indicate that a physiologic concentration of
E2 stimulates rapid genomic responses in CAFs through
the GPR30/EGFR/ERK transduction pathway.
E2 induces the formation of GPR30-EGFR complex and
its recruitment to the cyclin D1 promoter
Based on our recent data obtained in different cancer cell
types (19), we therefore evaluated the potential direct inter-

action between GPR30 and EGFR in CAFs. Interestingly,
1 nmol/L of E2 stimulated the coimmunoprecipitation of
GPR30 with activated EGFR in the nuclear protein fraction
(Fig. 4A). Considering that EGFR can act as a transcription
factor able to activate in a direct manner the expression of
genes required for its mitogenic effects and considering
that the nuclear localization of EGFR has been correlated
with the highly proliferative status of cells and tissues (9–
12), we attempted to uncover in CAFs the functional cross-talk
between EGFR and GPR30 within the cyclin D1 promoter sequence. Surprisingly, 1 nmol/L of E2 induced the recruitment
of activated EGFR to the cyclin D1 promoter region, and this
effect was abolished in silencing GPR30 expression, as determined by ChIP assay (Fig. 4B). Next, the recruitment of
GPR30 to the cyclin D1 promoter sequence by 1 nmol/L of
E2 was blocked, knocking down the expression of EGFR
(Fig. 4C). To further corroborate the aforementioned results,
CAFs were transfected with an expression vector encoding a

Nuclear localization of GPR30 and pEGFRTyr1173
Different studies have shown the nuclear localization of
EGFR in a variety of systems (9–12). As it concerns GPR30,
it has reported only plasma membrane and cytoplasmic distributions (reviewed in ref. 15). To better assess the nuclear
localization of GPR30 required for its recruitment to the cyclin D1 promoter sequence together with EGFR in CAFs, we
performed a set of immunofluorescence experiments. CAFs
were immunostained with the anti-GPR30 antibody LSA4271 (MBL-Eppendorf) and double labeled by Alexa Fluor
488–conjugated anti-GPR30 antibody to localize GPR30
(green signal) and by DAPI (blue signal; Fig. 5A–C) or propi-

dium iodide (red signal; Fig. 5D–F) to localize nuclei. Notably,
GPR30 showed a distinct punctate nuclear distribution pattern (Fig. 5A–I), which was observed also using a different
GPR30 antibody (N-15 sc-48525 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Supplementary Fig. S3). The aforementioned results
were corroborated using a specific shGPR30 that effectively
silenced GPR30 expression, whereas a control shRNA did not
exhibit any activity (Fig. 5G–L). Next, CAFs were immunostained with antiphospho-EGFRTyr1173 antibody and double
labeled by Alexa Fluor 594 to localize activated EGFR
(red signal) and by DAPI (blue signal). As shown in Fig. 5
(M–O), activated EGFR was also detected in the nuclear

GPR30 (left) or pEGFRTyr1173 (right) and then blotted as indicated. CAFs were transfected with control shRNA and shGPR30 (B) or with control shRNA
and shEGFR (C); cells were treated with 1 nmol/L E2 or vehicle for 1 h and then ChIP assays were performed to amplify by PCR the cyclin D1 promoter
region. Input nuclear DNA was used as PCR controls. D, CAFs were transfected with a luciferase vector containing the cyclin D1 promoter with two
intact ATRS or the same promoter with the ATRS mutated. After 24 h of incubation, cells were treated with 1 nmol/L E2 or vehicle. Columns, mean of

both Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated preimmune serum and
Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated preimmune serum, the nuclear
staining was readily detectable only by DAPI (data not

GPR30 and p-EGFR detection.

we next questioned what the biological significance of
GPR30 signaling might be. Interestingly, silencing GPR30 expression CAFs grew poorly (Fig. 6A) and lost the migratory
response to 1 nmol/L E2 (Fig. 6B and C). Taken together, our
results suggest that GPR30 mediates the stimulatory effects
exerted by a physiologic concentration of E2 in CAFs.

carcinoma cells (17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 37, 38). GPR30 expression
was also strongly correlated with tumor size, HER-2 expression and distant metastasis in a survey of 321 primary breast
tumors (24), although a further study on breast cancer failed
to find similar results (39). Likewise, GPR30 expression was
associated with poor prognosis in endometrial carcinomas
and ovarian cancer (40–42).
In the present study, we show that in CAFs, a physiologic
concentration (1 nmol/L) of E2 induces through GPR30 the
rapid ERK activation and the expression of genes like c-fos,
cyclin D1, and CTGF that are largely involved in cell proliferation and migration. Interestingly, we found that 1 nmol/L
E2 stimulates the functional cross-talk between GPR30 and
activated EGFR in association with the cyclin D1 promoter
region, thus implying a nuclear localization of both receptors.
In this regard, previous studies well documented that EGFR
can function as a transcription factor to activate genes required for highly proliferating activities (9–12). As it concerns
GPR30, compelling evidence showed that its distribution
either associated with the cell membrane or within the cyto-

plasmic compartment likely depending on the cell type, and
even for a given cell type, on additional intracellular and extracellular factors (reviewed in ref. 15). Hence, our findings
unravel an unexpected nuclear localization of GPR30, which
implicates additional mechanisms involved in its function
respect to those currently known.
Intracellular effectors that stimulate GPCR-mediated
ERK1/2 phosphorylation include the well-characterized heterotrimeric G proteins, which are made up of three subunits,
α, β, and γ. Upon activation, the α subunit of each of the four
families of heterotrimeric G proteins, Gαi/o, Gαs, Gαq/11, and
Gα12/13, as well as the tightly associated β γ complex can
modulate ERK1/2 activation through numerous mechanisms
(43). In addition to the pathways described above, both α and
β γ subunits of G proteins can stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation through transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases.
Transactivation leads to receptor tyrosine kinase dimerisation, autophosphorylation and, as such, modulation ERK1/2
phosphorylation through the pathway described above (43).
Thereafter, activated ERK1/2 concentrates in the nucleus

Nuclear GPR30 Mediates 17β-Estradiol Action in CAFs

where it activates specific programs of gene expression, as
shown by time-lapse imaging in living cells (44). In this vein,
our data further highlight the role played by E2-induced
ERK1/2 gene regulation, even through a nuclear cross-talk
between GPR30 and pEGFR in cells composing the tumor
microenvironment.
Recently, we have shown that in ER-negative breast cancer
cells, the activation of GPR30 by estrogen or hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), which is an ER antagonist but an activator of
GPR30, induces a transcription factor network resembling
the stimulation of serum in fibroblasts (26). In the aforementioned study, we found that the most strongly induced gene,
CTGF, contributes not only to cell proliferation but also mediates the GPR30-induced stimulation of cell migration.
Given that CTGF primarily modulate and coordinate signaling responses involving cell surface components of the extracellular matrix, the integration of these molecular cues
might trigger the stimulation of cell motility, invasion, and
remodeling that actually promote a poor outcome in breast
cancer patients.
The crucial interplay between cancer cells and stroma has
pointed toward innovative strategies for targeting the microenvironment in cancer chemoprevention (45–47). In this regard, our results may shed new light into the potential of
CAFs to mediate the stimulatory signals of estrogens in cancer cells as well as in the surrounding stromal compartment.
Interestingly, recent studies have suggested that CAFs could

be used as therapeutic targets for a variety of carcinomas (1).
As it concerns breast cancer, endocrine therapies designed to
block estrogen signals are the most effective treatments in
ER-positive tumors. In addition to ER antagonists, aromatase
inhibitors have been developed and reported to be effective
in advanced breast carcinomas (48). Based on the present
data, the therapeutic action of aromatase inhibitors could
be elicited not only decreasing the bioavailability of estrogen
in ER-positive breast cancer but also preventing the estrogen
production and stimulation in ER-negative CAFs.
Our results provide novel insights into the action elicited
by E2 through a peculiar localization and function of GPR30
in CAFs. Further studies are needed to better assess the role
played by GPR30 in tumor-surrounding cells.
