Abstract
Increased activity of the renin angiotensin system with enhanced levels of angiotensin II leads to oxidative stress with
endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.
Epidemiologic studies revealed a higher cancer mortality
and an increased kidney cancer incidence in hypertensive
patients. Because elevated angiotensin II levels might contribute to carcinogenesis, we tested whether angiotensin II
induces DNA damage in the kidney. In isolated perfused
mouse kidneys, as little as 1 nmol/L angiotensin II caused a
significant increase in DNA strand breaks, measured with the
comet assay. This damage was independent of the hemodynamic effect of angiotensin II and mediated by the angiotensin
II type 1 receptor. Angiotensin II also caused double-strand
breaks in the cells of the isolated perfused kidney, detected
with an antibody against the double-strand break marker
;-H2AX. Studies in cell culture allowed further characterization of the DNA damage induced by angiotensin II. Single- and
double-strand breaks, abasic sites, and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, all types of oxidative DNA lesions, were detected in
angiotensin II–treated renal cells. The majority of detected
strand breaks was repaired within 1 hour, but double-strand
breaks increased and persisted for at least 24 hours. [Cancer

Introduction
The renin angiotensin aldosterone system plays an integral role
in the homeostasis of arterial pressure, tissue perfusion, and
extracellular volume. Increased levels of angiotensin II can cause
hypertension and contribute to the progression of kidney diseases
by stimulating growth, inflammation, and fibrosis (1–3). Epidemiologic studies exploring the connection between hypertension and
cancer incidence found a higher cancer mortality in hypertensive
patients (4) and an increased risk to develop kidney cancer (5, 6).
We observed the formation of DNA damage following treatment
with angiotensin II in vitro (7). This damaging effect could be
ascribed to the activation of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1)
receptor with subsequent release of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
The pivotal enzyme responsible for angiotensin II–mediated ROS
generation in the kidney is the NADPH oxidase complex, which is
composed of two membrane-bound components (p22phox and
Nox1, Nox2, or Nox4), three cytoplasmic subunits (p40phox,
p47phox, and p67phox), and the small GTPase Rac 1/2 (8–10). In
contrast to the neutrophil NADPH oxidase, the enzyme complex in
nonphagocytic cells continuously forms low levels of superoxide
intracellularly and can be further activated by agonists such as

angiotensin II (11). Angiotensin II activates NADPH oxidase either
by up-regulating subunits, like Nox1, p22phox, p47phox, and
p67phox (3, 12), or by facilitating the assembly of the subunits
(13, 14). Nox4 is unique because it seems to operate constitutively,
being regulated at the mRNA level (15, 16). The ROS produced on
stimulation with angiotensin II is mainly superoxide, which is
converted enzymatically to hydrogen peroxide and can also react
to hypochlorous acid and the hydroxyl free radical (3).
ROS on their part are able to evoke DNA damage (17). More than
100 oxidative DNA adducts have been identified; in addition, ROS
directly induce single- and double-strand breaks, abasic sites, and
DNA cross-links (18). Estimations exist that a human cell is
exposed to up to 105 oxidative hits a day from ROS, which can
result in permanent modifications representing the beginning of
carcinogenesis (17).
To transfer our results of the genotoxic effect of angiotensin II in
cell culture to the more physiologic context of an intact kidney, we
examined the effect of angiotensin II in the isolated perfused
mouse kidney. This model is widely used for studies of renal
physiology and pathophysiology in the absence of interindividual
influences of systemic confounding factors (19, 20). Whereas the
application of angiotensin II in vivo is accompanied by marked
hemodynamic effects, which might indirectly induce genotoxicity,
the isolated kidney allows the observation of effects under
controlled conditions (e.g., under a constant perfusion pressure).
The alkaline comet assay was done for the first time with cells
extracted from isolated perfused kidneys. The comet assay is a
rapid and quantitative method to measure DNA damage in any
tissue, provided that a single-cell suspension can be obtained
(21, 22). Its greatest advantage is its applicability to terminally
differentiated nondividing cells, such as cells out of the isolated
perfused kidney.
Further experiments served to characterize the DNA damage
caused by angiotensin II. As an alternative marker for DNA
damage, the phosphorylation of histone H2AX (g-H2AX) was used,
which marks chromatin at the damage site and serves to recruit
DNA repair and signaling molecules (23). Cleavage at oxidatively
altered bases by the enzyme formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG; ref. 24) is another sign for the involvement of ROS in
the development of the DNA damage. To show the base
modifications after angiotensin II treatment of cultured cells, the
comet assay with FPG preincubation was carried out. In addition,
the repairability of the angiotensin II–induced genomic lesions was
investigated using the comet assay and the detection of g-H2AX.

Materials and Methods
Materials. If not mentioned otherwise, all chemicals were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich. Candesartan was provided by AstraZeneca.
Isolated perfused mouse kidneys. Male C57BL/6 mice (20–26 g body
weight, Charles River) with free access to commercial pellet chow and tap
water were used as kidney donors. Perfusion of isolated mouse kidneys was
at a constant pressure of 100 mm Hg conducted as described earlier (20).

Stock solutions of the test substances were added to the perfusate for 1 h
with a latency of 10 min. After perfusion, the isolated mouse kidney was
minced to small pieces in 3 mL buffer [RPMI 1640, 15% DMSO, 1.8% (w/v)
NaCl], sifted through a cell strainer with a mesh pore size of 100 Am (Becton
Dickinson), precipitated at 1,000 rpm and 4jC for 5 min (Heraeus Labofuge
400e), and resuspended in 1 mL buffer.
Cell culture. LLC-PK1, an epithelial porcine kidney cell line with
proximal tubule properties, was obtained from American Type Culture
Collection and grown in DMEM (1.0 g/L glucose) supplemented with 10%
FCS, 1% glutamine, 25 mmol/L HEPES buffer, and antibiotics. Cells were
split routinely twice a week to ensure exponential growth and were cultured
for no more than 10 passages after thawing them from stock.
Determination of cell vitality. The fluorescein-ethidium bromide assay
was carried out according to Yang and colleagues (25), with the following
modifications: The staining solution contained 30 Ag/mL fluorescein
diacetate and 12 Ag/mL ethidium bromide. Cells (17.5 AL) were stained
with 7.5 AL staining solution. Ten microliters of this mixture were applied to
the slide and the fractions of green and red cells in a total of 2  200 cells
were counted under a microscope at a 200-fold magnification. Vital cells
stain green because their active esterases cleave the acetate groups from
fluorescein diacetate, which then starts to fluoresce. Dead cells stain red
because ethidium bromide can cross their defective membrane and
intercalates in the DNA. Cells with residual esterase activity and defective
membranes appear brownish green and were not included in the
quantification.
Quantification of apoptotic cells. Apoptotic cells were quantified with
the NucView 488 Caspase-3 Assay Kit for Live Cells (Biotium, Inc.). In brief,
50 AL of the kidney cell suspension were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min
in a microfuge. The cells were resuspended in 200 AL PBS, and 5 AL caspase-3
substrate was added. After 30-min incubation at room temperature, the
cells were washed twice with PBS (4,000 rpm, 5 min, microfuge) and
resuspended in 10 AL PBS. The number of green fluorescent apoptotic cells
was counted under a microscope at a 200-fold magnification in a total of
200 cells observed under transmitted light. Apoptotic cells stained green
because the substrate of caspase-3 included in this kit, on cleavage, migrates
into the nucleus and starts to fluoresce after binding to the DNA.
Comet assay. LLC-PK1 cells (3.5  105), seeded the day before in small
culture flasks, were treated for 4 h with test substances in 5 mL medium.
Afterward, the cells were harvested. Cell suspensions of extracted primary
kidney cells or LLC-PK1 cells were used in the comet assay as described
earlier (26) using a fluorescence microscope at a 200-fold magnification and
computer-aided image analysis (Komet 5, Kinetic Imaging Ltd.). After DNA
staining with propidium iodide (20 Ag/mL), 25 cells from each of two slides
were measured, with percent tail DNA being the evaluation parameter.
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from the frozen kidneys as
described earlier (27). For amplification of the cDNAs, the following primers
were used: glutathione peroxidase , 5¶-GTCCACCGTGTATGCCTTCT-3¶
(sense), 5¶-CCTGAGAGAGACGCGACATT-3¶ (antisense); heme oxygenase,
5¶-CAGGTGATGCTGACAGAGGA-3¶ (sense), 5¶-TCTCTGCAGGGGCAGTATCT-3¶ (antisense); NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox (p47),
5¶-GTCCCTGCATCCTATCTGGA-3¶ (sense), 5¶-GGGACATCTCGTCCTCTTCA-3¶ (antisense); NADPH oxidase subunit Nox4, 5¶-CTGGAAGAACCCAAGTTCCA-3¶ (sense), 5¶-TGACAGGTTTGTTGCTCCTG-3¶ (antisense);
b-actin, 5¶-TACAGCTTCACCACCACAGC-3¶ (sense), 5¶-CCTCAGAGAGACGCGACATT-3¶ (antisense). All amplificates were sequenced and found to be
99% to 100% identical to the respective mouse gene.
Detection of phosphorylated ;-H2AX sites. For immunofluorescence
staining of phosphorylated g-H2AX foci, LLC-PK1 cells treated with test
substances for 4 h and cells from perfused mouse kidneys were transferred
onto glass slides by cytospin centrifugation and fixed in ice-cold methanol
for at least 2 h. After washing, rabbit polyclonal antibody to g-H2AX
(Abcam) was added 1:100 in 5% PBS/FCS for 1 h at 37jC to LLC-PK1 cells,
and phospho-histone H2AX (pS139) rabbit monoclonal antibody (Epitomics) was added 1:100 in 5% PBS/FCS for overnight at 37jC to the mouse
cells. After washing with PBS + 0.2% Tween, the FITC-conjugated secondary
antibody was added for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were
mounted with Antifade Gold (Invitrogen). Images of LLC-PK1 cells were

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

visualized and captured using an Axioskop 2 (Zeiss) with a 100-fold oil
immersion lens. g-H2AX foci of cells from perfused mouse kidneys were
visualized and captured using an Eclipse 55i (Nikon) with a 40-fold lens and
quantified by measuring gray values of 200 cells per perfused kidney with
ImageJ 1.40g (28).3
For flow cytometric quantification of g-H2AX, 106 LLC-PK1 cells, seeded
the day before in medium culture flasks, were treated with test substances
for 4 h, washed twice with PBS, and supplied with fresh medium. After 0, 15,
30, 60, 120 min, and 24 h, cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, and
fixed for 1 h in ice-cold ethanol (70%). Cells were washed twice with cold
PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X in PBS for 10 min at room
temperature. Unspecific antibody binding sites were blocked for 30 min
with 5% FCS in PBS. Thereafter, cells were centrifuged and incubated with
1.5 AL of 1:100 anti–phospho-histone H2AX (clone JBW301, Millipore) in 5%
PBS/FCS overnight at 4jC. Cells were washed twice with FCS/PBS and
incubated with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min in the
dark. After washing twice with PBS/FCS, 740 AL PBS, 50 AL saponin (1% in
PBS), and 10 Ag propidium iodide were added and phosphorylated g-H2AX
foci were detected by flow cytometry (FACS LSR I, Becton-Dickinson).
Geometric means were assessed using the ‘‘histogram statistics’’ function of
CellQuest Pro 4.0.
Determination of FPG-sensitive sites. FPG-sensitive sites were
determined by comet assay including an incubation step with FPG. After
treatment with test substances, embedding the cells in agarose, and lysis of
the cell membranes, the slides were washed thrice for 5 min in cold buffer
(40 mmol/L HEPES-KOH, 100 mmol/L KCl, 0.5 mmol/L Na2EDTA, and
0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin) to remove the lysis solution. The FPGsensitive sites were detected by incubation of the nuclei embedded in
agarose with 0.005 Ag/mL FPG protein (kindly donated by Professor Bernd
Epe, Institute for Pharmacy, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany) for
60 min at 37jC. Afterward, the comet assay was carried out as described
above. In this case, ethidium bromide (20 Ag/mL) was used for DNA
staining. The net level of FPG-sensitive sites was obtained as the difference
in score between samples incubated with FPG protein and samples
incubated with buffer.
Detection of abasic sites. Cells were treated with test substances for
4 h, harvested, and subsequently fixed in ice-cold ethanol (100%) for
10 min at 4jC. The cells were washed once with cold PBS and incubated
for 2 h at 25jC with 1 mL staining solution [5 Amol/L Alexa Fluor 488
C5-aminooxyacetamide, bis(triethylammonium) salt (Alexa Fluor 488 hydroxylamine, Invitrogen), 3% acetic acid, 2% dimethylformamide, 0.25 mol/L
MgCl2 in PBS] per sample. Abasic sites were detected by flow cytometry.
The medians of the resulting histograms were evaluated using the freeware
WinMDI 2.8.4
For microscopic detection of abasic sites, cells were treated with test
substances for 4 h, harvested, and brought to slides by cytospin
centrifugation. After fixation in ice-cold methanol for at least 2 h, cells
were stained with 10 AL staining solution for 2 h at 25jC. Hereupon, the
slides were washed extensively with PBS and mounted with Antifade Gold.
Images were visualized and captured using an Axioskop 2 (Zeiss) with a
40-fold magnification. For better comparison, these pictures were magnified
2.5 times in Fig. 2B.
Statistics. If not mentioned otherwise, data from at least three
independent experiments F SD or SE ( flow rate of the kidneys) are
depicted. Statistical significance among multiple groups was tested with
Kruskal-Wallis over all groups, and Mann-Whitney test was used to
determine significance between two groups. For calculations, SPSS 16.0 was
used. Results were considered significant if P V 0.05.

a dose-dependent, significant increase in DNA damage after 1 hour

perfusate flow (milliliters per gram of kidney). The perfusion
procedure itself caused only a small amount of DNA strand breaks
in comparison with nonperfused kidneys processed the same way.
The following experiments were conducted with the angiotensin II
concentration of 10 nmol/L to ensure a sufficiently high damage,
which has the potential to be decreased significantly.
To exclude artifacts in the comet assay due to cytotoxicity, a
vitality assay was done with cells extracted from nonperfused,
control-perfused, and angiotensin II–perfused kidneys. Samples
from all these treatments showed no difference in the percentage
of viable cells (Table 1). Induction of apoptosis was monitored
by staining the cells for caspase-3 activity. Again, no significant
difference was observed between cells from nonperfused, controlperfused, and angiotensin II–perfused kidneys (Table 1).

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

To exclude the possibility that the DNA damage was caused by
mechanical stress or hypoxia due to the angiotensin II–induced
vasoconstriction, the thromboxane mimeticum U46619 was infused
in the same concentration as angiotensin II. Although application
of U46619 resulted in approximately the same vasoconstriction
as application of angiotensin II, it did not induce DNA damage
(Fig. 1B). A combination of U46619 and angiotensin II was not able
to reduce the flow rate any further and resulted in a comparable
DNA damage as induced by angiotensin II alone. These two
vasoconstrictors therefore showed neither synergism nor antagonism in their action.
To examine whether the AT1 receptor is involved in the formation of angiotensin II–induced DNA strand breaks in ex vivo perfused mouse kidneys, the AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan was

applied. In fact, whereas 5 Amol/L candesartan alone had no effect
on DNA damage and perfusate flow, it completely prevented angiotensin II–induced DNA damage and restored the flow (Fig. 1B).
Quantification of double-strand breaks with an antibody against
g-H2AX, an early marker of these lesions (23), showed a 1.4-fold
increase in angiotensin II–perfused kidneys (Table 1).
Measurement of transcript expression of the oxidative stress
marker genes glutathione peroxidase and heme oxygenase, as well as
of the NADPH oxidase subunits Nox4 and p47, showed no change
after 1-hour perfusion of the kidneys with angiotensin II compared
with the control kidneys (Table 1).
Cell culture experiments. To characterize in more detail the
angiotensin II–induced DNA damage, further experiments were
conducted in LLC-PK1 cells, a porcine kidney cell line with
proximal tubule properties.
First, the occurrence of double-strand breaks induced by angiotensin II was investigated. Immunofluorescence staining showed that
treatment with 200 nmol/L angiotensin II, a concentration that was
chosen after previous experiments (7), resulted in an increased
frequency of g-H2AX (Fig. 2A). Flow cytometric quantification of
g-H2AX revealed a significant increase in fluorescence after treatment with angiotensin II (Fig. 3A). Addition of candesartan restored
control levels.
Abasic sites were detected by immunofluorescence staining and
by flow cytometry. For this, the abasic sites were tagged with a
fluorescent aldehyde-reactive probe. As can be seen in Fig. 2B, the
nuclei of angiotensin II–treated cells are much brighter than those
of the control or the candesartan-treated cells. Flow cytometric
quantification revealed these differences in fluorescence-labeled
abasic sites to be significant, whereas the cotreatment with candesartan yielded levels comparable to the untreated control (Fig. 3B).
Besides strand breaks and abasic sites, oxidative stress leads
to the formation of base modifications such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxodG). 8-OxodG is the main DNA lesion recognized
by FPG in the FPG-modified comet assay. Whereas the normal
alkaline comet assay detects strand breaks and abasic sites, the
addition of FPG to it allows the quantification of the base
modifications. The enzyme incises the DNA at the site of the lesion,
thereby generating additional strand breaks (24). Treatment with
angiotensin II significantly increased the occurrence of FPGsensitive sites shown in Fig. 3C. Coincubation with candesartan
prevented the formation of these oxidative base modifications.
To test if angiotensin II–induced DNA damage was only
transient, DNA repair after treatment with angiotensin II was
measured in a time course experiment by comet assay over a time
period of 24 hours. Already after a recovery period of 15 minutes,
the cells were able to repair approximately half of the induced DNA

strand breaks, and after 24 hours, no more strand breaks than in
the control were detected (Fig. 4). Quantification of double-strand
breaks at the same time points by flow cytometry in contrast
showed an increase of g-H2AX in the course of the recovery period,
suggesting the persistence of double-strand breaks. FPG-sensitive
sites were repaired even faster than the strand breaks detected in
the normal comet assay; already after 30 minutes, control levels
were reached (Fig. 4).

Discussion
In the isolated perfused kidney, angiotensin II caused dosedependent vasoconstriction and DNA strand breaks. Control

kidneys perfused for 1 hour without any pharmacologic intervention showed a small increase in DNA damage compared with
unperfused kidneys subjected to the comet assay immediately after
sacrifice of the mice; thus, the perfusion per se had a slight effect
on the integrity of the DNA. DNA strand breaks can also be caused
by cytotoxic or apoptotic processes, which were observed in
angiotensin II–treated cells by others (29, 30). Therefore, we tested
the cells isolated out of the perfused kidney for their vitality and for
an early apoptotic marker, the stimulation of caspase-3 activity.
Although there was a certain amount of dead cells in the
preparations, which was most likely due to the extraction
procedure, there was no difference between the angiotensin II–
treated kidneys and the control kidneys. We measured cytotoxicity
and apoptosis only after 1 hour, whereas others report these effects
of angiotensin II as late as after 16 to 72 hours (29, 31). Therefore, it
cannot be excluded that angiotensin II would later induce
cytotoxicity and apoptosis in the kidney at the concentration of
10 nmol/L. The short perfusion time could also be responsible for
the lack of changes in the expression of the two analyzed oxidative
stress marker genes, heme oxygenase and glutathione peroxidase,
and the two analyzed NADPH oxidase subunit genes, p47 and
Nox4. The reaction of glutathione peroxidase on increased
angiotensin II levels was until now only studied in whole animals
(32). Increase in heme oxygenase-1 expression in kidney cells was
only seen after 16 to 48 hours (29, 33). Expression of p47 and Nox4
was higher after 1-hour incubation with 100 nmol/L angiotensin II
in smooth muscle cells (34). In one report on kidney cells
(podocytes), Nox4 was up-regulated, but details of incubation time
and angiotensin II concentration are missing (35).
Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that significantly
reduced kidney perfusion in our study. Because ischemia is known
to cause tubular epithelial necrosis and apoptosis (36) and both
processes would generate DNA damage detectable in the comet
assay, it is critical for our conclusion that the observed effects of
angiotensin II are not related to its vasoconstrictor effects. The
thromboxane mimetic U46619 generated a marked vasoconstriction, hereby drastically reducing kidney perfusion, but it did not
induce DNA damage. This observation reinforces our hypothesis
that the AT1 receptor–mediated DNA damage in the isolated
perfused kidneys indeed is independent of the hemodynamic
effects of angiotensin II.

Besides performing the comet assay, we quantified doublestrand breaks in the same perfused kidney samples. The histone
H2AX has been shown to be rapidly phosphorylated after induction
of double-strand breaks and is thought to promote repair protein
recruitment (23). g-H2AX can be visualized with the help of
phospho-specific antibodies (37). Double-strand breaks are the
most toxic form of DNA damage, resulting in cell death or genetic
alterations like large- or small-scale deletions, loss of heterozygosity, translocations, and chromosome loss (38). The chromosomal rearrangements that may occur after incorrect repair are
considered a major initiating factor in carcinogenesis (39).
However, because double-strand breaks and DNA damage
observed in the comet assay could nevertheless theoretically be
completely repaired, further experiments were conducted in the
porcine kidney cell line LLC-PK1 to be able to evaluate the
relevance of the DNA damage induced by angiotensin II ex vivo.
Flow cytometric measurements and immunofluorescence staining of g-H2AX in LLC-PK1 cells indicated that angiotensin II induced
double-strand breaks in a significant number, which even increased
over 24 hours. Comparison of these data with the additional repair
comet assay and FPG-repair comet assay revealed that overall, the
number of lesions decreased whereas that of double-strand breaks
increased. This increase can be due to repair procedures during
which DNA strands are incised at oxidative lesions.
In an earlier study, we have shown that, besides DNA damage,
which is detectable by comet assay, a 24 hour-incubation with
angiotensin II also caused micronuclei (7). Micronuclei, a subset of
chromosomal aberrations, are chromatin-containing structures in
the cytoplasm, surrounded by a separate membrane. They can be
formed by chromatin with double-strand breaks, resulting in
chromosome fragments lagging behind at anaphase during nuclear
division (40). Thus, the double-strand breaks we detected after
angiotensin II perfusion might lead to chromosomal aberrations
and possibly also to initiation of carcinogenesis, further supported
by enhanced cell proliferation and growth in the kidney, which is
known to be caused by angiotensin II (41).
The alkaline comet assay detects a variety of lesions: singleand double-strand breaks, incomplete excision repair sites, and
apurinic or apyrimidinic sites, which are alkali labile and therefore
appear as breaks under the alkaline conditions of the assay (42). To
detect base oxidation, the very sensitive FPG-modified comet assay

Angiotensin II Induces DNA Damage in the Kidney

was chosen. FPG is a bacterial DNA glycosylase/abasic site lyase
enzyme that recognizes diverse but structurally related oxidative
DNA base modifications like 7-hydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxodG),
formamidopyrimidines, N 7-methyl formamidopyrimidines, and
also abasic sites (43, 44). The significant increase in DNA damage
observed with this assay supports the thesis that the angiotensin
II–induced damage is of oxidative nature. Although the 8-oxodG
lesions were repaired rather fast, 8-oxodG nevertheless has
mutagenic potential, and repair errors or unrepaired 8-oxodGs
lead to A:T!C:G and G:C!T:A transversions (43, 45). With an
aldehyde-reactive probe, which reacts with aldehyde groups of
abasic sites as well as with residual sugar moieties of DNA strand
breaks (46), we could show that abasic sites, also a major class of
oxidative DNA damage, increased after angiotensin II treatment.
Additional experiments in the isolated perfused kidney could help
to clarify the mechanism that causes the DNA damage (e.g., by
identifying the involved radicals).
Summarizing, our study shows that angiotensin II induces DNA
damage in the form of single- and double-strand breaks not only in
cell culture but also in the intact whole kidney. In vitro, we could
provide evidence for the possible destructive effect of the DNA
strand breaks by showing that double-strand breaks persisted long
after other comet assay–detectable lesions had been repaired. The
AT1 receptor blocker candesartan was able to prevent all kinds of
injury caused by angiotensin II, proving the damage to be mediated
by this receptor.

Elevated concentrations of angiotensin II in humans may be
either due to an activated renin angiotensin system in hypertension
or formed locally in the kidney. Here, angiotensin II concentrations
can be up to 1,000 times higher than in the plasma (47, 48) and
therefore possibly have the potential to lead to DNA damage,
followed by mutations and the onset of carcinogenesis. Further
animal studies will have to show if angiotensin II indeed causes
malignant transformations. An ongoing study examines the effect
of an AT1 receptor inhibitor on the DNA damage of peripheral
blood lymphocytes of patients whose medication was changed
from another antihypertensive therapy. Finally, in humans,
correlations between angiotensin II levels, blood pressure, and
kidney damage should be investigated.
