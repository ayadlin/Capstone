BACKGROUND. The objectives of this study were to assess the status and clinical
course of patients with multiple myeloma based on the direct visualization of
changes in medullary, extramedullary, and focal osteolytic myeloma involvement
by using whole-body, low-dose, multidetector computed tomography (WBLDMDCT) and to compare those results with an assessment based on conventional
hematologic parameters.

METHODS. Between June 2002 and December 2005, WBLD-MDCT scans were
obtained from 131 consecutive multiple myeloma patients with or without ther-

apy, resulting in a total of 439 examinations. The number and size of osteolytic
lesions and the number, size, and density of focal or diffuse medullary and extramedullary lesions were analyzed. Those results and the results at follow-up were
related to current laboratory tests for myeloma. Validation was achieved by the
combined reading of both hematologic and radiologic parameters at follow-up.

RESULTS. Association between both diagnostic modalities was assessed by using
European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation response criteria, resulting in an agreement of j ¼ 0.70. Hematologic parameters proved correct in 84%
of all examinations, whereas WBLD-MDCT resulted in correct assessment in 94%
of all examinations. Among 91 of 439 examinations that produced discrepant
findings (21%), WBLD-MDCT proved correct in 68 of 91 examinations (75%), as
determined at further follow-up (95% confidence interval, 66–83%; P ¼ .000003;
sign test). The combination of WBLD-MDCT with conventional, laboratory-based
follow-up resulted in significantly greater diagnostic accuracy compared with laboratory testing alone.

CONCLUSIONS. The results from this study indicated that WBLD-MDCT represents a reliable, imaging-based method for the direct monitoring of the course of
patients with myeloma under specific therapy, and it showed good concordance
with established hematologic parameters. It is noteworthy that, in the current
investigation, WBLD-MDCT proved to be even more reliable than conventional,
laboratory-based follow-up. Cancer 2007;109:1617–26.

changes in paraprotein levels, detected from either
blood or urine, currently represents the backbone of
myeloma therapy response monitoring in clinical
routine. Sequential assessments of these parameters
are mandatory before a definite conclusion can be
drawn. Thus, unlike in most other malignant disorders, an indirect substitute parameter (paraprotein
secretion) serves as a basis to estimate tumor mass
in multiple myeloma and, hence, progression/regression under therapy. However, changes in paraprotein
levels may be discordant with the actual development of the disease, especially in patients with myeloma who receive treatment with these novel
agents.1 Imaging techniques that directly allow visualization of actual increases or decreases in the myeloma cell mass during the course of the disease are
likely to offer significant additional information in
this situation.2–4
Durie and Salmon have demonstrated that the
myeloma cell mass is correlated with the extent of
lytic bone involvement.5 Accordingly, a thorough evaluation of the extent of lytic involvement has been
considered necessary for 3 decades. Current imaging technologies, namely, magnetic resonance
(MR) imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron
emission tomography (FDG-PET), have improved
detection of the extent and location of disease, challenging the role of conventional radiographs in the
work-up of patients with myeloma.4,6–11 Although
they are more sensitive and accurate, these modalities are not applied routinely for the follow-up of
patients with myeloma, in part because of their high
cost and limited availability. The main advantage of
MRI is the visualization of the bone cavity content,
allowing a direct assessment of the extent of myeloma cell infiltration even before bone destruction
becomes visible on plane radiographs.11,12 Consequently, MR signal alteration represents a more reliable method for monitoring therapy response in
myeloma patients compared with conventional radiographic studies.
In analogy to MRI, whole-body, low-dose, multidetector computed tomography (WBLD-MDCT) can
be implemented in the assessment of multiple myeloma because of its ability to depict simultaneously
all 3 categories of myeloma manifestations: bone
marrow involvement (especially in the appendicular
skeleton), extramedullary manifestations, and lytic
bone destruction throughout the whole skeleton, the
latter in a similar but more confident fashion than
conventional x-ray. Thus, the objectives of this prospective study were to establish the value of WBLDMDCT for the follow-up of patients with myeloma
before and after treatment and to relate changes in

medullary, extramedullary, and bone involvement to
established hematologic criteria for therapy response
assessment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Characteristics
Between June 2002 and December 2005, 131 consecutive patients (73 men and 58 women; mean age,
61.2 years; age range, 40–86 years) who presented
with stage I (n ¼ 12 patients), stage II (n ¼ 23
patients), or stage III (n ¼ 96 patients) multiple myeloma according to the criteria defined by Durie and
Salmon were enrolled in a prospective trial and
underwent a WBLD-MDCT survey parallel to hematologic follow-up (70 patients with immunoglobulin
G [IgG] myeloma, 28 patients with IgA myeloma, 1
patient with IgD myeloma, 27 patients with lightchain myeloma, and 5 patients with nonsecretory
myeloma). All patients received 1 therapy(s) during
consecutive follow-up. Since June 2002, skeletal radiographs have been replaced routinely at our institution by WBLD-MDCT in all patients who provided
their written informed consent to the examination.
Approval for the publication of patient data was
obtained from our institutional Research Ethics
Board.
Treatment regimens differed and were determined by the referring hematologist mainly according to disease stage, prognostic cytogenetic and
laboratory parameters, age, and comorbidities. At the
time patients were included, 63 patients had newly
diagnosed myeloma (and were included for statistic
purposes in the progressive disease [PD] category), 8
patients presented with hematologic complete remission (CR) after treatment, 47 patients had a durable
hematologic partial remission (PR), 11 patients had
no change, and 2 patients had hematologic PD.
The patients who were analyzed were treated either in the frontline setting or after the developed
recurrent myeloma. For the vast majority of patients
aged <60 years, frontline treatment consisted of
combined idarubicin and dexamethasone (ID)-based
induction therapy; followed by stem cell mobilization
with combined ifosfamide, etoposide, and epirubicin
(IEV); and tandem melphalan 200 mg/m2-based,
high-dose chemotherapy (or, alternatively, busulfane/
cyclophosphamide). Most patients aged 60 to 70
years received tandem melphalan 140 mg/m2 highdose therapy with or without prior induction in the
frontline setting. Therapy at recurrence mostly comprised dexamethasone, bendamustine, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, or thalidomide-based regimens.
One hundred patients received high-dose melphalan;

28 patients received a busulfane regimen; 26 patients
received ID; 9 patients received IEV; 4 patients
received combined vincristine, doxorubicin, and
dexamethasone, 11 patients received high-dose dexamethasone; 22 patients received bendamustine; 9
patients received bortezomib; and 4 patients received
thalidomide. Six patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), and 6
patients received alternative alkylating agent-based
chemotherapeutic combinations. All patients with
lytic bone lesions received monthly bisphosphonate
treatment. For all patients, WBLD-MDCT images
were obtained before and after treatment.

Computed Tomographic Image Acquisition
Computed tomographic (CT) examinations were performed nonenhanced (without oral or intravenous
contrast dye application) on an MDCT scanner
(SOMATOM Sensation 16; Siemens, Forchheim,
Germany). A 16-mm 3 0.75-mm collimation protocol
with a 0.5-second rotation time was chosen. The
tube voltage was 120 KV, and the tube current time
product was 70 mAs.13 The scan length was in all
patients 1530.6 mm, stretching from the roof of the
skull down to the knees (depending on the patient’s
height, mostly down to the proximal tibial metaphysis), including the entire skull, axial skeleton, thoracic
cage, and the arms down to the elbows. The table
speed/rotation was 24 mm. Thin collimation made
whole-body coverage along the z-axis in 1 helical
possible, with a mean acquisition time of 75 seconds.
Patients were positioned supine, head first, with the
arms stretched in elevation and abduction over the
head, so that we also would be able to analyze bone
changes in the upper limbs.
Laboratory Data
For each patient, the levels of serum Ig, hemoglobin,
b2-microglobulin, and creatinine were determined at
the time of diagnosis and at each follow-up. The presence of Bence-Jones protein in the urine was
assessed and quantified in all patients by protein
electrophoresis from 24-hour concentrates. The
mean time interval between assessing these hematologic parameters and performing WBLD-MDCT was
0.1 days (standard deviation, 17.8 days). In 54% of
our patients, both examinations were performed on
the same day. The normal values for hematologic parameters determined by the laboratory at our institution were hemoglobin, 12 to 14 g/dL in women and
14 to 16 g/dL in men; creatinine, 0 to 1.1 mg/dL; b2microglobulin, <3 mg/dL; IgG, 700 to 1600 mg/dL;
IgA, 70 to 400 mg/dL; and IgD, 100 kU/L.

Hematologic parameters were registered at initial
presentation and follow-up, and all changes were
documented that occurred compared with the previous investigation (hematologic assessment). Based
on this assessment, patients were classified with no
change, minimal response, PR, CR, PD, or recurrence
after CR (R-CR) in analogy to standard therapy
response criteria of the European Group for Blood
and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, and the Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry.14
For patients with nonsecretory myeloma, bone marrow plasmacytosis, serum hemoglobin, and clinical
parameters like bone pain were considered in the hematologic assessment of their disease course.

Image Analysis
Changes in the number and size of focal osteolytic
bone lesions were assessed by WBLD-MDCT at each
examination to monitor therapy response. Only typical, punched-out osteolysis that showed no sclerotic
rim or cystic content was considered for myeloma
staging; and other, typically benign bone lesions
were excluded (eg, osteoma, enchondroma, etc). In
addition, we registered all focal or diffuse infiltrations
of the femoral and humeral bony canal and of the
pelvic bones with regard to their number, size, and
density. In the pelvic bones, bone marrow density
was considered pathologic when it occurred in a
focal, nodular fashion or proved to be denser than in
other areas of trabecular bone (eg, proximal humeral
or femoral metaphysis) or when it became denser at
follow-up. The density of bone marrow involvement
was measured by using circular regions of interest
(ROI), and the results were documented in Hounsfield units (HU). At follow-up, we analyzed all
changes that had occurred in relation to the previous
investigation. Manifestations of extramedullary myeloma also were registered and evaluated over time.
All images were assessed by 2 experienced radiologists (M.H. and P.P.) separately; and, in the case of
equivocal results, the decision was made by consensus. Both readers were blinded with respect to the
clinical course of the disease and the course of hematologic parameters, but they were informed about
the diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
Because there are no established international
standards for evaluating myeloma with imaging techniques, we proceeded in classifying tumor response
as assessed by WBLD-MDCT in a fashion analogous
to hematologic EBMT response criteria, as follows:
An increase >25% in the number, size, and density
of lytic bone lesions, medullary lesions, and extramedullary lesions was considered PD. The absence of

1620

CANCER

changes in size, number, and density of medullary
and extramedullary lesions was considered no
change. A decrease <25% in the size, number, or
density of medullary and extramedullary lesions was
considered a minimal response; a decrease 50% in
the size, number, or density of medullary and extramedullary lesions was defined as PR; and the entire
resolution of medullary and extramedullary lesions
was defined as CR. Radiologic recurrence was defined as the appearance of new medullary, extramedullary, or lytic lesions (R-CR).
Validation of the individual course of disease for
any given examination point was achieved by combined evaluation of hematologic, clinical, and radiologic data at the next subsequent examination,
taking into account all changes (clinical, laboratory
based, and radiologic) that had occurred during the
interval since the last evaluation in consensus
between a radiologist and a medical oncologist (M.H.
and C.D.). In the discussion below, we refer to the
result of this retrospective validation of an individual
assessment as the correct diagnosis. If 1 method
revealed worsening of the course of the disease at
this assessment (ie, PD or R-CR), then it always was
considered correct, whereas PR or CR were confirmed only if both assessment modalities agreed. If
the criteria for PD, R-CR, minimal response, PR, or
CR as the correct diagnosis were not met, then the
patient was considered to have no change.

Follow-up
All patients regularly visited our hematology department for follow-up examinations, including the laboratory parameters defined above, and clinical
assessment. WBLD-MDCT-based imaging was performed if it was indicated clinically (median interval,
7 months) (Fig. 1). The median interval of hematologic follow-up after diagnosis or after therapy was 3
months. WBLD-MDCT follow-up lasted from 3
months to 40 months (median, 20 months) between
the first and last visits. Routine bone marrow biopsies were not obtained at such visits. All therapies
were registered, and the time interval between therapy and CT investigation was documented.
Statistical Analysis
Agreement of EBMT categories between different
combinations of diagnostic traits was expressed as
excess over the expected agreement by unweighted
kappa (j) coefficient and agreement with the reference diagnosis as accurate. Diagnostic superiority
was described by P values of sign tests and 95% confidence intervals, and both were computed by using
exact binomial probabilities.

RESULTS
At the time patients were included, 112 patients presented with multiple osteolytic lesions, 3 patients
presented with solitary lesions, and 16 patients presented without lytic bone lesions. Bone lesions were
sclerotic in just 2 patients. Hyperattenuating bone
marrow lesions were absent in 73 patients at the
time of their inclusion in this study, 44 patients
had focal medullary lesions, and 14 patients had
homogeneous, diffuse bone marrow attenuation
(involvement). Considering both medullary and focal
osteolytic myeloma involvement, in total, 126
patients presented with myeloma involvement that
was detectable by means of WBLD-MDCT. In 8
patients who presented without lytic bone lesions,
we visualized bone marrow involvement by WBLDMDCT. Extramedullary myeloma manifestations were
encountered in only 10 patients at initial presentation.

Therapy Response Monitoring Based on Either WBLDMDCT or Conventional, Laboratory-based Criteria Yields
Conflicting Results
To address the validity of myeloma therapy response
assessments based on WBLD-MDCT, first, we compared the agreement between WBLD-MDCT and
EBMT standard therapy response criteria in 131 consecutive patients who had histologically confirmed
myeloma (Table 1). This comparison yielded 92 of
439 discrepant results (21%) at the time of assessment or agreement of j ¼ 0.70. Most conflicting
results in this respect were observed in patients who
were classified with PD based on WBLD-MDCT
(n ¼ 186 patients). Only 136 of those patients (73%)
also were assessed with PD according to hematologic
criteria, whereas 24 of 186 patients were assessed
with no change, and even 22 of 186 patients were
assessed with PR. Conversely, of 78 patients who had
no change based on hematologic assessment, 24

patients (31%) were assessed with PD according to
WBLD-MDCT studies, 3 patients were assessed with
PR, and 148 patients were assessed with no change.
In 9 patients, PD was observed hematologically but
was assessed as PR by WBLD-MDCT. In all other
categories for the course of disease, discrepant
results between laboratory-based and WBLD-MDCTbased assessment were less frequent.

WBLD-MDCT-based Monitoring Yields a More Accurate
Evaluation of Therapy Response Than Laboratory-based
Assessment Only
Next, we wanted to evaluate which of the 2 assessment modalities, already at the time of data acquisition, would be more appropriate to describe the
course of the disease, as defined by the combined
results from WBLD-MDCT and laboratory testing
obtained at the next consecutive follow-up (referred
to below as the correct diagnosis) (Table 2). In this
sense, of 439 assessments that were performed, 348
assessments (79%) yielded the correct diagnosis
according to both laboratory-based and WBLDMDCT findings at the time of examination. However,
of the 91 discordant results, laboratory-based assessment was correct in only 23 discordant results (25%),
whereas WBLD-MDCT yielded the correct diagnosis
in 68 discordant results (75%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 65–83%; P ¼ .000003). WBLD-MDCT
findings were very reliable with in 97% agreement
(j ¼ 0.96).

WBLD-MDCT indicates whole-body, low-dose, multidetector computed tomography.* Of 91 of 439
discrepant findings (20.7%) in 68 of 91 patients (75%), computed tomography was correct (95% confidence interval, 65–83%; P value (sign test) ¼ .000003).

Combined Assessment of Myeloma by WBLD-MDCT and
Laboratory-based Monitoring Is More Accurate Than
Either Modality Alone
When results from laboratory-based testing were
combined with WBLD-MDCT for assessment at the
time of examination, the result was significantly
more accurate in leading to the correct diagnosis
than either assessment method alone: Of 64 discrepant results between combined reading and exclusively laboratory-based assessment, combined reading
proved correct in 53 examinations (P < .0001). Similarly, in 12 of 27 discrepant results between combined
reading and WBLD-MDCT, combined reading was correct and, thus, was as accurate in reaching the correct
diagnosis as assessment based on WBLD-MDCT alone
(P ¼ .70).
WBLD-MDCT-based Imaging Is More Accurate in
Assessing the Course of Myeloma Than a Combined
Evaluation of Laboratory Parameters and Osteolytic
Lesions
Conventional routine assessment of the course of
myeloma is based on the combination of serologic
parameters and the evaluation of the course of osteolysis using plane x-rays. To compare this with
WBLD-MDCT-based assessment, we separately analyzed the course of osteolysis as deferred from
WBLD-MDCT and used this as a substitute parameter for results obtained by plane x-rays, assuming
that CT-based assessment is at least as accurate as
conventional x-rays. The conclusions reached by the
combination of laboratory-based tests and this CTbased assessment of osteolysis were defined as conventional assessment. From 80 examinations in which
the results obtained from WBLD-MDCT were not in
agreement with those based on conventional assessment, WBLD-MDCT led to the correct diagnosis in

1622

CANCER

57 examinations, whereas conventional assessment
was correct in 23 examinations (95% CI, 60–81%;
P ¼ .000183). When assessments were based on the
combination of WBLD-MDCT and laboratory testing
and were compared with conventional assessment,
53 results were discordant. In 42 of those examinations, WBLD-MDCT combined with laboratory testing was correct, compared with 1 examination in
which conventional assessment yielded the correct
result (95% CI, 0.66–0.89%; P < .000022).

Characterization of Patients with PD Classified
Incorrectly by Laboratory Testing
Response assessment based exclusively on hematologic parameters failed in 25% of patients who presented with PD (49 of 197 patients) compared with
6% (12 of 197 patients) who were categorized incorrectly by WBLD-MDCT-based evaluation (Tables 3
and 4). Twenty-one of 197 patients with PD were
misclassified, even with PR, by laboratory assessment
compared with 6 of 197 patients who were misclassified with PR or CR by using CT-based criteria (Fig. 2).
Of the 24 patients who had been classified with
no change by laboratory criteria but with PD by
WBLD-MDCT criteria, 21 patients had shown
changes in at least 1 of the 2 parameters paraprotein
level and/or b2-microglobulin (Table 5). However,
the laboratory changes observed did not meet the
criteria required by the PD definition and, thus,
could not be differentiated unequivocally from nonspecific changes in laboratory values at the time of
assessment. It is noteworthy that, in 3 patients, PD
occurred even without alterations in conventional
hematologic parameters. Of the 21 examinations in
which PD was misclassified as PR by laboratory testing, progressive medullary involvement was demonstrated by WBLD-MDCT in 17 examinations, and it is
entirely consistent that hemoglobin levels deteriorated at the next consecutive follow-up visit in these
patients, although serum or urine paraprotein levels
largely remained unchanged (Fig. 3).
All 24 patients with PD who were classified
incorrectly with no change by conventional serology
had been assessed correctly by WBLD-MDCT (Table
6). It is strikingly that only 5 of those patients
demonstrated a progressive course of osteolysis,
whereas PD in the majority of those misclassified
patients could be demonstrated only by progression
of bone marrow lesions (13 patients), extramedullary
manifestations (1 patient), or both (4 patients).
Consequently, a conventional, standard followup, which consisted of laboratory testing and radiologic assessment based on standard techniques,

would have missed PD at the respective visit in at
least 38 of 197 patients (19%) who had progressive
myeloma in our series. It is noteworthy that this estimate was based on the assumption that even conventional radiologic assessment using plane x-rays
has a sensitivity comparable to that of CT with regard
to the detection of osteolytic lesions. By contrast,
WBLD-MDCT categorized only 6 of 197 patients who
had progressive myeloma with no change at the time
of assessment. However, because all patients who
had PD missed by WBLD-MDCT-based assessment
had shown PD based on laboratory testing, all 197
patients with PD could be classified correctly at the
time of assessment when the information obtained
from both WBLD-MDCT and laboratory testing was
considered in combination.

FIGURE 2. These are images from a patient aged 50 years with stage III
light-chain j multiple myeloma. After melphalan high-dose chemotherapy
and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, the patient achieved partial
remission (PR). At that time, there were no significant residual bone marrow
abnormalities at control whole-body, low-dose, nonenhanced, multidetector,
computed tomography (WBLD-MDCT). In addition, the ubiquitous osteolysis
remained unchanged. Five months later, nodular medullar lesions occurred in
both femoral and humeral bones at different sites, as documented by a myeloma computed tomography scan (eg, in the right femoral diaphysis with a
density of 80 Hounsfield units) (see Fig. 2a,b), whereas the hematologic
parameters still showed PR. The patient complained about newly occurring
bone pain. Shortly afterward, another WBLD-MDCT image was obtained that
revealed extramedullary myeloma involvement along the ribs (not shown),
which was confirmed by biopsy.

FIGURE 3. (a--d) These are images from a patient aged 62 years with
stage III immunoglobulin A (IgA) myeloma that was diagnosed first in July
2003. At that time, medullary lesions with a density of 40 Hounsfield units
(HU) (arrow) were detected in both femoral (a) and humeral diaphyses. The
IgA and b2-microglobulin levels were 5370 mg/dL and 10 mg/dL, respectively. Upon subsequent therapy, hematologic partial remission (PR) was
achieved in June 2004 (IgA, 2420 mg/dL; b2-microglobulin, 2.1 mg/dL). At

stable for the next 6 months (d). Follow up computed tomography scans
showed ongoing progression of medullary bone involvement with stable osteolysis. Subsequently, the patient developed progressive anemia and renal

Lack of Visible Medullary and Extramedullary Lesions
Limits the Sensitivity of WBLD-MDCT to Detect Myeloma
Progression
To gain a better understanding of the limitations of
WBLD-MDCT in myeloma response assessment, we
conducted a separate analysis of all 12 patients who
had WBLD-MDCT examinations that failed to identify PD. In these patients, the course of the osteolysis
also was stable at subsequent follow-up visits, and
none of the patients had detectable medullary or
extramedullary lesions. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of
PD based on hematologic parameters also proved
correct at follow-up in all 12 patients.
Extramedullary lesions were detected at follow-up
in 30 WBLD-MDCT-based assessments. The occurrence and progression of extramedullary lesions in
some patients were responsible for unexpected PD
(Table 6). None of these extramedullary myeloma
lesions were known or clinically suspected prior to CT.
The course of osteolysis showed little agreement
with that of medullary and extramedullary lesions
when PD or R-CR were present. Thus, progress of osteolysis was observed by WBLD-MDCT in only 25 of
132 follow-up examinations (18%) in patients with
validated PD; although, in 102 of 132 examinations,
WBLD-MDCT was capable of visualizing disease progression by the progress of medullary and/or extramedullary involvement. In 1 of 2 patients who
presented with R-CR, osteolysis showed no changes
at the given time point. Therefore, evaluation of the
course of medullary or extramedullary lesions at follow-up was essential. Only in a small percentage of
examinations (2%) did progression of osteolysis
occur before medullary lesions revealed any changes
with regard to number, size, or density. PR and CR
sometimes were accompanied by an increase in peripheral sclerosis of osteolysis after therapy.

DISCUSSION
With the development of high-dose chemotherapy as
a backbone of myeloma care and the advent of novel
classes of powerful therapeutic agents like proteasome inhibitors and thalidomide and its analogues,
an increased survival of patients with multiple myeloma has been reached and still is anticipated. Likewise, the array of these new and relatively nontoxic
therapeutic agents potentially allows for numerous
lines of myeloma therapy by combining these novel
agents with classic cytotoxic drugs. For the assessment of the course of myeloma, this has 2 major
consequences: Because of improved survival and
therapeutic options, especially in patients with recurrent myeloma, it may become desirable to introduce
therapy before irreversible end-organ damage (like
osteolysis) has occurred, which would require sensitive and highly reliable tools for the assessment of
myeloma progress. Second, the prolonged survival of
patients with myeloma likely will lead to increased
numbers of patients with advanced disease in a
genetic sense. In these patients, the strong association between paraprotein levels and myeloma mass
gets lost because of clonal evolution, and extramedullary myeloma growth may become more frequent.
In addition, because thalidomide has poor activity
against extramedullary myeloma lesions, thalidomide
treatment may select for the presence of extramedullary lesions, which is not mirrored by conventional
radiographic assessment.
Modern imaging techniques like as MRI and
FDG-PET have been proposed both for myeloma staging and for monitoring response to chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, none of these technologies has been
proven entirely reliable in this regard.13,15 In a recent
report, Durie emphasized the increasing role of imaging in the diagnosis, follow-up, and therapy
response monitoring of patients with myeloma
because of the known limitations of the hematologic
parameters.16 It has been suggested that FDG-PET
may provide a superior whole-body imaging tool that
is able to detect all disease manifestations in and
outside the bone marrow, differentiating between
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and active myeloma and allowing reliable
screening and prognostic evaluation of myeloma disease early during therapy. However, because of the
limited spatial resolution of PET technology, complementary techniques like MRI remain necessary.
Recently, Breyer et al. compared FDG-PET with other
imaging modalities (x-ray, CT, and MRI) in a small
series of patients with multiple myeloma and
demonstrated that 133 additional (generally small)
lesions that were missed by FDG-PET could be

WBLD-MDCT in Multiple Myeloma/Horger et al.

detected by the other imaging modalities. Therefore,
those authors concluded that FDG-PET/CT and the
other imaging modalities were complementary and
that their joint reading led to an increase in sensitivity in the detection of myeloma lesions.17 Similarly,
an infiltrative pattern of spinal myeloma involvement
was observed with 25% greater sensitivity by using
MRI compared with 18F-FDG-PET/CT.18
Thus, sensitivity for the assessment of mild, diffuse bone marrow involvement seems to represent a
limitation for all imaging techniques, as also demonstrated by our CT study and by other authors who
have dealt with MRI in patients with myeloma. Wasser et al. reported that diffuse bone marrow infiltration by myeloma could be detected reliably by MRI
only in patients with advanced involvement.19
Compared with conventional radiographic studies, MRI, FDG-PET and WBLD-MDCT share the
advantage of providing information about the activity
of lesions within the medullary space, depending on
the degree of bone marrow infiltration by myeloma.
Although the use of different sequence combinations
for tissue characterization is needed for MRI-based
imaging, WBLD-MDCT exclusively delivers information that mirrors electron density in the bone marrow. Among patients with myeloma who have not
received recent therapy, the electron density is only
increased in those with myeloma infiltration. Therefore, interpretation of WBLD-MDCT is much easier,
enabling the evaluation of tumor cell density indirectly by measuring the density (HU) of hyperattenuating bone marrow involvement and extent, as
demonstrated in the current study. Using standardized investigational protocols and nonenhanced
techniques, tumor density can be compared reliably
and independent of contrast medium kinetics, which
depend in part on cardiac output.
Although MRI may be more sensitive than
WBLD-MDCT with respect to the visualization of
bone marrow involvement in the axial skeleton, the
higher diagnostic costs of MRI and the much longer
acquisition time are unlikely to allow a regular sequential follow-up by using this modality on a routine basis in the majority of institutions that treat
patients with myeloma.
In this report, for the first time to our knowledge,
we have evaluated WBLD-MDCT-based imaging
alone and in combination with hematologic parameters as a rapid, reliable, sensitive, comprehensive,
patient-friendly, and cost-effective assessment tool
for the course of myeloma in patients undergoing
therapy. According to our results, a conventional
assessment based on hematologic parameters and
the visualization of lytic bone lesions has relatively

1625

poor sensitivity with regard to the detection of disease progression. In this respect, evaluation exclusively by WBLD-MDCT (including the assessment of
medullary and extramedullary myeloma involvement) was significantly more sensitive and accurate.
Currently, we lack data to assess the value of
WBLD-MDCT for monitoring response to therapy in
patients with multiple myeloma, especially with
regard to a combined evaluation of medullary, extramedullary, and lytic bone lesions. Our current results
indicate that, consistent with data from MRI studies,
effective treatment leads to changes in the appearance of either focal or diffuse medullary lesions as
well as extramedullary tumor manifestations. Successful treatment of the affected bone marrow was
associated with following changes: decreases in the
size and density of medullary and extramedullary
lesions up to complete resolution and increases in
the density of osteolysis beginning at the periphery
of the lesion and progressing in a centripetal fashion.
In 25 of 26 patients with hematologic CR defined
according to EBMT criteria, medullary lesions returned to normal, representing radiologic CR, after
the completion of therapy. Conversely, 25 of 27
patients who achieved the complete radiologic resolution of bone marrow infiltrates proved to have
hematologic CR. In partial responders to therapy, the
size, number, and density of both focal-nodular and
diffuse bone marrow infiltrates decreased over time,
usually showing residual abnormalities. However, PR
was missed by WBLD-MDCT in patients who presented without medullary or extramedullary myeloma manifestations, which were assessed as no
change or even remission. In patients who remained
stable at follow-up, no changes in the appearance of
medullary, extramedullary, or osteolysis occurred
over time; thus, they all were classified correctly by
WBLD-MDCT.
Ninety-six of 132 patients who were assessed with
PD demonstrated an increase in the number, size, and
density of medullary lesions, sometimes also associated with new medullary and extramedullary involvement or even new osteolytic lesions. In particular,
the density of medullar lesions increased up to 90 HU,
which represents densely packed aggregates of tumor
cells. Only a minority (26 of 134 patients) of those who
presented with a worsening disease course (PD or RCR) also had progress of their osteolysis.
A final analysis of all results that were misclassified by WBLD-MDCT showed that the majority of
them (21 of 25 examinations) belonged to the patient group without evidence of medullary or extramedullary involvement at WBLD-MDCT. In these
patients, radiologic data did not lead to a correct

1626

classification, also because of the slower kinetics of
lytic bone lesions.
The current results indicate that the evaluation of
all types of myeloma involvement (medullary, extramedullary, and osteolytic) can be assessed reliably by
WBLD-MDCT. Like other methods, such as MRI, a limitation of WBLD-MDCT lies in failure to assess low
degrees of diffuse bone marrow infiltration. In these
patients, radiologic evaluation of tumor response to
therapy relies solely on the course of osteolysis. Nevertheless, this limitation was encountered in only a
small percentage of our patients and was remediated
by using data from hematologic follow-up.
Finally, this study also was focused on the assessment of tumor response to therapy, as judged by
the combined course of hematologic and radiologic
parameters. The results showed a considerable
degree of consistency between these 2 modalities but
also major discrepancies, in part because of different
kinetics of the survey parameters. Based on our data,
WBLD-MDCT should be regarded as a complementary, noninvasive tool for improving therapy response
assessment in patients with myeloma.
In summary, the widespread availability of CT
installations, short acquisition time (75 seconds),
lower cost, and high patient acceptance offered by
the WBLD-MDCT technique, combined with comprehensive information regarding staging, skeletal
stability, medullary involvement, and extramedullary
involvement, make it an attractive diagnostic tool.
We anticipate that the widespread use of this technology can increase the diagnostic accuracy and
reliability for evaluating the course of myeloma. It
remains to be determined whether this also will
translate into a lower degree of irreversible organ
damage, such as osteolysis, and, thus, improved
quality of life for patients with myeloma when therapy can be initiated earlier because of more reliable
and sensitive assessment of recurrent myeloma
based on advanced imaging techniques.
