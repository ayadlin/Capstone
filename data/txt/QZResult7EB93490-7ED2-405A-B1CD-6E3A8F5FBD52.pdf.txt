ABSTRACT
Pretreatment lymphocyte count (LC) has been associated with prognosis and
chemotherapy response in several cancers. The predictive value of LC for stage II
colorectal cancer (CRC) and for high-risk patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy
(AC) has not been determined. A retrospective review of prospectively collected data
from 1332 consecutive stage II CRC patients who underwent curative tumor resection
was conducted. A pretreatment LC value <1.3 Giga/L(28.1%, 373/1332) was defined
as low LC. A total of 738 patients (55.4%) were considered high-risk, 459 (62.2%) of
whom received AC. Patients with low LCs had significantly worse 5-year OS (74.6%
vs. 90.2%, p < 0.001) and DFS (61.3% vs. 84.6%, p < 0.001). High-risk patients
with low LCs had the poorest DFS (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that
low LC value or combined with high-risk status were both independent prognostic
factors(p <0.001). High-risk, AC-treated patients with high LCs had significantly
longer DFS than untreated patients (HR, 0.594; 95% CI, 0.364–0.970; p = 0.035).
There was no difference or trend for DFS or OS in patients with low LCs, regardless
of the use of AC (DFS, p = 0.692; OS, p = 0.522). Low LC was also independently
associated with poorer DFS in high-risk, AC-treated patients (HR, 1.885; 95% CI,
1.112–3.196; p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment LC is an independent
prognostic factor for survival in stage II CRC. Furthermore, pretreatment LC reliably
predicts chemotherapeutic efficacy in high-risk patients with stage II CRC.

histology, lympho-vascular and perineural invasion, have
been defined as high-risk factors associated with a worse
prognosis for stage II CRC [3]. Current clinical guidelines
recommend adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for such patients
to prevent tumor recurrence after curative surgery [4, 5].
Although these high-risk factors do not reliably predict
chemotherapeutic outcome, their presentation is typically
associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, high-risk
patients possess the greatest relative benefit from adjuvant
treatment [6].
However, the outcome of adjuvant treatment for
these patients remains controversial. The MOSAIC trial

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
tumor in men, the second most common tumor in women,
and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death
worldwide [1]. For stage II disease, which represents
30–40% of all resected CRCs, the five-year relative
survival rate is 75%, indicating that 25% of patients relapse
and die of their cancer within 5 years of surgery [2].
Several clinical and pathological features, including
T4 stage, bowel perforation or clinical bowel obstruction,
inadequate lymph node sampling, poorly differentiated

documented a nonsignificant trend toward improved
survival in patients with high-risk stage II disease who
were treated with adjuvant treatment [7]. Conversely, an
analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-Medicare data demonstrated a lack of survival
benefit from AC in the same population [8]. Therefore,
there is great interest in the elucidation of additional
prognostic and predictive biomarkers that can improve
outcome through patient classification.
Recent findings have revealed that cancer patient
outcomes are not only determined by tumor characteristics
but also by patient-related factors. Analysis of the local
tumor environment has revealed the role of the immune
system in preventing tumor recurrence [9]. Recent studies
have reinforced the belief that defective functioning or
decreased numbers of lymphocytes reduce the ability
of a patient’s immune system to mount an effective
response to cancer cells. Pretreatment lymphocyte count
(LC) is considered a surrogate marker for the level of
immunosuppression in patients and has been associated
with prognosis in several cancers, including hematological
malignancy, breast cancer, and renal cell cancer [10–12].
It has also been suggested that low LC is associated with
poor response to chemotherapy or radiotherapy [13, 14],
suggesting the important role of LC in survival and
clinical treatment response. Therefore, we speculated
that pretreatment LC might have important predictive
value in the prognosis of stage II CRC and the outcome of
high-risk patients treated with AC. To our knowledge, no
studies have investigated the value of LC in such patients.
Therefore, we conducted a large-scale retrospective cohort
study to investigate the prognostic and predictive value of
pretreatment LC as a widely available marker for stage II
CRC and to identify the stage II CRC patients who will
best benefit from the use of AC.

0.3–5.3). The LC distribution in our patients is shown in
Fig. 2. The median follow-up time was 816 days (mean,
924.9 days; range, 8–2480 days). Among the patients,
738 (55.4%) were considered high-risk and 594 (44.6%)
were deemed low-risk. Within the high-risk group, the
most frequent poor prognostic features included T4 tumor
(58.3%), suboptimal lymph node sampling (27.4%),
perineural invasion (21.5%), lymphovascular invasion
(13.0%) and poor differentiation (21.1%). Approximately
188 patients (25.5%) had >1 poor prognostic factor. In
the high-risk group, 459 (62.2%) patients received AC.
The adjuvant treatments were as follows: a semi-monthly
regimen of 5-FU and leucovorin (LV5FU2 regimen,
n = 20); capecitabine (n = 119); a semi-monthly regimen
of 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen,
n = 132); and a regimen of capecitabine and oxaliplatin
(n = 189).

Determination of LC cutoff value
To analyze the predictive value of LC for DFS
and OS in patients with stage II CRC, X-tile software
was used. This software allowed us to define an optimal
cutoff point that defined the LC value required to predict
prognosis. For OS, the maximum of ×2 log-rank values
of 25.19 ( p < 0.001) was achieved when applying an
LC of 1.2 as the cutoff value (Fig. 3A), but for DFS, the
maximum log-rank statistical value was 25.36 ( p < 0.001)
when the cutoff value was 1.4 (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we
utilized a median of 1.3 as the optimal cutoff value for
both OS and DFS in stage II CRC.

Correlation of LC with clinicopathological
characteristics
Patient baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.
The incidence of low LC was 28.1% (373/1332). As
a continuous variable, low LC correlated with tumor
location ( p = 0.012), T stage ( p = 0.025) and high risk
( p = 0.034). As a dichotomous variable, low LC was
associated with vessel invasion ( p = 0.048).

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
A total of 1494 patients were retrieved from the
database. Of these, 162 were excluded from the study
for the following reasons: previous or concomitant other
cancers (n = 54); complete intestinal obstruction or
perforation (n = 48); clinical evidence of infection (n = 16);
preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (n = 14); endocrine
tumors (n = 5); and missing or inaccessible medical files
(n  = 25). Thus, 1332 consecutive patients with stage II
CRC were selected for this study. Patients excluded from
the analysis were shown in a flow chart (Fig. 1).
Of the 1332 patients, 511 were women (38.4%) and
821 were men (61.6%). The median age for the entire
cohort was 60 years (mean, 60.0; range, 17–90). The
anatomic locations of the primary tumors were the colon
in 688 cases (51.7%) and the rectum in 644 cases (48.3%).
The median LC value was 1.6 Giga/L (mean, 1.71; range,

Clinical outcome of LC status or LC status
combined with high-risk factors in stage II
colorectal cancer
In Kaplan-Meier analyses, patients with low LCs
exhibited decreased postoperative OS and shorter DFS
(Fig. 4A, 4B). The 5-year OS and DFS rates of low-LC
patients were 74.6% and 61.3%, respectively, which
were significantly lower than those of high-LC patients
(OS, 90.2%; DFS, 84.6%; p < 0.001). We divided
the patients into low- and high-risk groups. Patients
with high LC values and a low-risk status had the best
prognosis, whereas those with low LC values and a highrisk status had the worst prognosis, with the lowest OS

and DFS (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4C, 4D). Univariate analysis
showed that poor DFS was significantly associated with
perineural invasion (HR, 2.140; p < 0.001), lymph node
sampling <12 (HR, 1.618; p = 0.011), CEA > 5.0 μg/ml
(HR, 1.682, p = 0.002) and LC ≤ 1.3 (HR, 2.214;
p < 0.001). Furthermore, LC ≤ 1.3 was also associated with
poor OS (HR, 2.486; p < 0.001) (Table 2). Multivariable
analysis of survival revealed that perineural invasion (HR,
1.957; 95% CI, 1.292–2.965; p = 0.002),CEA > 5.0 μg/ml
(HR, 1.488, p = 0.022) and LC (HR, 2.090; 95% CI,
1.493–2.925; p < 0.001) were independent prognostic
factors for DFS. Additionally, LC had a significant effect
on OS (HR, 2.425; 95% CI 1.507–3.901; p < 0.001). In
the multivariable model, the combination of LC and risk
factors was also confirmed to be an independent prognostic
indicator, especially for DFS (p < 0.001) (Table 3).

The 738 high-risk patients were divided into two
groups: a low-LC (n = 223, 30.2%) and a high-LC group
(n = 515, 69.8%). Among the two groups, 136 patients
(61.0%) and 323 patients (62.7%) received AC. The
baseline characteristics are described in Table 4. In the
Kaplan–Meier analyses, the patients treated with AC
exhibited a nonsignificant improvement in postoperative
DFS and OS compared with untreated patients (DFS,
p  =  0.168; OS, p = 0.141; Fig. 5A, 5D). Interestingly,
in the high-LC group, the patients treated with AC had a
significant DFS advantage compared with those who did
not receive AC (5-year DFS rate of 85.3% vs. 69.4%; HR,
0.594; 95% CI, 0.364–0.970; p = 0.035; Fig. 5C). There

individual factors associated with poor prognosis in
the high-risk patients. The patients with T4 tumors
demonstrated significant improvements in DFS following

the use of AC both in the high-risk group and the group

rate of 85.3% vs 55.4%) (Fig. 7A, 7B).In univariate

significantly associated with poorer DFS (HR, 1.978;

predictive value of pretreatment LC in stage II CRC and
high-risk patients treated with AC.
In recent years, several reports have documented
a correlation between peripheral LC and survival in
patients with various types of malignancies, including
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma, and lung cancer [16–18]. However, LC
cutoff values vary among different cancers, ranging from
1.0 to 1.9 [14, 16–18]. Therefore, in this study, X-tile
software was used to analyze the optimum cutoff value of
LC for stage II CRC. The data showed that a median LC
of 1.3 was the optimal cutoff value for OS and DFS, and
this value was also employed in previous studies [12, 19].
Next, we evaluated the efficacy of LC for predicting
postoperative survival. LC was associated with vessel
invasion and high-risk factors, which is concordant with
data from Jian Zhang et al [20], who found that low
LC was related to lymphatic invasion in non-small cell
lung cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrated that patients
with low LCs had significantly decreased postoperative
5-year OS (74.6% vs. 90.2%, p < 0.001) and shorter
DFS (61.3% vs. 84.6%, p < 0.001) compared to those
with high LCs. In multivariate analysis, low LC was
a significant and strong independent poor predictive
factor for DFS ( p < 0.001) and OS ( p < 0.001). It is
well known that the high-risk factors for stage II CRC
include perforation, T4 tumors, suboptimal lymph node
sampling, poor differentiation, colonic obstruction, and
lymphovascular or perineural invasion [3, 5]. In the
current study, we excluded the impact of perforation and
colonic obstruction on baseline LC. Among the remaining
features, perineural invasion (HR, 2.140; p < 0.001) and
suboptimal lymph node sampling (HR, 1.618; p = 0.011)

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we performed a large-scale
retrospective cohort study on patients with stage II
CRC and described three major findings. First, LC is an
independent poor prognostic factor for DFS and OS in
stage II CRC. Second, by comparing high-risk patients who
did and did not receive AC, we found that patients with low
LC did not benefit from AC, whereas patients with high
LC had a significant DFS advantage, especially patients
with T4 stage disease. Finally, low LC was also associated
with poor prognosis in high-risk patients treated with AC.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the

demonstrated a lack of survival benefit from AC in the
same population (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.94–1.15; p = 0.47)
[8]. Therefore, there is considerable interest in elucidating
additional predictive biomarkers that could improve
outcome through patient classification. It is notable that
most prior research has focused on the factors associated
with poor prognosis in stage II patients while ignoring
host immune status. Ropponen et al [25] confirmed that
there is an inverse correlation between the presence
of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor stage in
CRC: infiltrating CD8+ T cells are more prominent
during early stages (stages I and II) and decrease in
number during advanced stages (stages III and IV). This
situation might be a consequence of systemic immune
suppression in patients with advanced-stage disease. This
possibility in turn suggests that immune status plays an
important role in the outcome of early-stage CRC because
micrometastases are more amenable to elimination via
host immune response. Therefore, in contrast to advanced
CRC, more attention should be paid to the combination
of immune status and poor prognostic factors when
evaluating treatment effect in stage II patients. In the
current study, we demonstrated that high-risk patients
treated with AC exhibited nonsignificant improvements in
DFS and OS (DFS: p = 0.168, OS: p = 0.141). High-LC
patients who received AC had a significant DFS advantage
compared to those not treated with AC (p = 0.035; HR,
0.594). However, there was no difference or trend in DFS
or OS in low-LC patients regardless of the receipt of AC
(DFS: p = 0.692; HR, 1.141; OS: p = 0.522; HR, 0.738).
In multivariate analysis, low LC was independently
associated with poorer DFS (p  = 0.019; HR, 1.885) in
high-risk patients treated with AC. The above research
supports our hypothesis that patient immune status
substantially impacts the outcome of AC. Stage II CRC
patients with a normal immune status might gain more
benefit from adjuvant treatment than those with a poor
immune status, who might derive no benefit, regardless of
the presence of high-risk factors.
Some studies have suggested an association between
pretreatment lymphopenia and poor cancer survival
or poor response to chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Lissoni et al [21] showed that lymphocytopenia prior to
chemotherapy is associated with lower treatment efficacy
in terms of objective tumor regression rates in patients
with metastatic solid tumors. Kitayama et al [33] and
Chi Hwan Choi [34] suggested that pretreatment LC was
an important determinant of preoperative radiotherapy
efficacy in advanced rectal cancer. The mechanism
underlying the association between low LC and
decreased chemotherapy efficacy is not well understood.
The possible reasons are as follows: 1) Chemotherapy
might cause lymphocyte depletion and alter the balance
of lymphocyte subpopulations [35], which might
further decrease LC in patients with lymphocytopenia.
Lymphocyte depletion, especially of T cells, potentially

were independent prognostic factors for reduced DFS.
Moreover, the combination of LC and risk factor status
was also confirmed as an independent prognostic indicator,
especially for DFS ( p < 0.001), and was even stronger
than LC alone.
There is substantial evidence that the systemic
immune response of a host against a tumor is a vital
independent prognostic factor. Solid tumors are generally
infiltrated with leukocyte subsets, among which
lymphocytes play a major role in the immune response by
mediating the immunologic destruction of various cancers
[21–23]. In CRC, Jass et al [24] and Ropponen et al [25]
noted that conspicuous lymphocytic infiltration along the
invasive tumor margin is an independent prognostic factor
for improved survival. In most cases, these lymphocytes
are either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells [26, 27]. Differentiated
CD8+ T cell clusters have a pivotal role in tumor growth
control via their induction of cytotoxic T-cell killing and
apoptosis [28]. The quantity of CD8+ T cells that are
present significantly correlates with improved diseasespecific survival in CRC [29]. Meanwhile, CD4+ T cells
play a central role in orchestrating the immune response to
cancer [30]. Although no direct research has demonstrated
that peripheral lymphocyte count correlates with the
number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, some studies
have indicated an association between them. Romano et al
[31] found that preoperative treatment with recombinant
human IL-2 significantly increased total peripheral blood
lymphocytes and CD4 cells, which resulted in higher
lymphocyte tumor infiltration. Additionally, Chiba et al
[29] observed that the prognostic impact of intraepithelial
CD8+ T cells in CRC is more evident when the followup period is longer. Disease-specific survival curves for
patients with different levels of intraepithelial CD8+
T cells are similar during the first 1–2 years of follow-up
and subsequently diverge. These survival curves were very
similar to the peripheral LC results in our study. Moreover,
Pages et al [32] also demonstrated that early metastatic
invasion is negatively associated with tumor-infiltrating
immune cells, which agreed with our results showing
that low peripheral LC was significantly associated with
vascular invasion. These results suggest that local immune
responses in tumor tissues might not actually be confined
to local sites but rather may reflect systemic anti-tumor
immune responses. Therefore, lymphocytopenia, as an
index of a generalized depressed immune status, might
adversely influence survival due to reduced systemic and
local host responses to tumors.
The role of AC is well established in stage III CRC,
but its benefit to stage II patients remains controversial.
The MOSAIC study demonstrated no improvement in
DFS or OS in 899 patients with stage II disease (DFS:
HR, 0.84; p = 0.258; OS: HR, 1.00; p = 0.986). A trend
toward improved outcome was noted among high-risk
stage II patients (DFS: HR, 0.72; OS: HR, 0.91; p = 0.648)
[7]. Conversely, an analysis of SEER-Medicare data

criteria were excluded: 1) incomplete resection with
microscopic or macroscopic residual tumors; 2) previous
or concomitant other cancers; 3) absence of detailed
information or clinical data; 4) clinical evidence of
infection, other inflammation, or hematologic disease, or
use of hematology-influencing drugs within one month; 5)
preoperative neoadjuvant therapy; 6) complete intestinal
obstruction or perforation; and 6) contact lost during
follow-up.
The following data were collected from the medical
records of each patient: age (<60 and ≥60 years); sex (male
or female); tumor size (≤5 and >5 cm); tumor location
(colon and rectum); T stage (T3 and T4); differentiation
(well, moderate, and poor); vessel invasion (negative and
positive); perineural invasion (negative and positive);
and number of lymph nodes sampled (<12 and ≥12).
Vessel and perineural invasion was recorded according
to the results of pathologic reports. The 7th edition was
used to define the T stage as follows: T3, invasion of
the adventitia; T4, invasion of adjacent structures. As
part of the physical examinations, peripheral blood was
collected before surgery, and peripheral lymphocytes were
counted using an automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex
XE-5000; Sysmex, Kobe, Japan).
LC cutoff points were produced and analyzed using
the X-tile program (http://www.tissuearray.org/rimmlab/),
which identified the cutoff with the minimum p values
from log-rank ×2 statistics in terms of survival [15]. The
endpoints assessed were disease-free survival (DFS) and
overall survival (OS). For assessment of DFS, recurrence
was defined as time from operation to development of
local, nodal (regional) and distant metastasis. OS was
defined as time from operation to date of death.
Patients with stage II disease complicated by T4
tumors, suboptimal lymph node sampling (<12 lymph
nodes), the presence of lymphovascular or perineural
invasion or poor differentiation were categorized as “highrisk”. For the high-risk group, the role of postoperative AC
is controversial, and adjuvant therapy was not mandatory.
The most frequent ACs included 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and
oxaliplatin. In all cases, treatment regimens were based on
recommended dosing ranges and schedules. The duration
of AC was 6 months.
Independent t tests were used to compare the LC
as a continuous variable. Chi-square tests were used to
determine the significance of differences for patients
grouped by LC as a dichotomous variable. Survival
curves were generated using Kaplan–Meier estimates, and
differences between the curves were analyzed by a logrank test. Cox regression models were built for analysis
of risk factors for survival outcomes in CRC patients.
Continuous variables, reported as LC, were compared
using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Multivariate analyses
with a Cox proportional hazards model were used to test
independence, significance, and hazard discrimination.
Covariates included in the model are given in the result

compromises the effectiveness of the anti-tumor immune
response. 2) Lymphopenia represents an ineffective antitumor immune response against cancer cells/tissues, which
leads to tumor recurrence regardless of the receipt of AC.
3) Lymphopenia appears to lead to severe chemotherapyinduced hematological toxicity [13], which results in a
significant disadvantage for patients. Collectively, our
results suggest that in stage II CRC, AC should be used
in high-risk patients with a favorable immune status
(LC > 1.3), especially those with stage T4 disease. For
high-risk patients with a poor immune status (LC ≤ 1.3),
AC should not be recommended because it does not
benefit survival and potentially leads to severe toxicity.
There are several limitations to the current study.
First, although we adopted rigorous inclusion and
exclusion criteria, it has been shown that diabetes mellitus
and renal and/or hepatic failure might potentially affect
lymphocytes [36, 37]. Additionally, anti-diabetic drugs,
anti-hypertensive drugs, and/or other medications might
potentially affect LC. Therefore, larger prospective
studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.
Second, toxicity information is not routinely collected
in our database, thereby limiting our ability to explore
this aspect in greater detail. Third, different schedules of
chemotherapy were used, leading to potential differences
in the outcome of AC. However, these limitations should
be viewed within the context of the study’s strengths,
including its population-based nature, generalizability,
and relatively large sample of patients with stage II CRC.
In conclusion, our study is the first to demonstrate
that pretreatment LC is an independent prognostic factor
for survival in stage II CRC patients. Furthermore,
pretreatment LC is also an independent prognostic factor
for high-risk patients treated with AC. Most importantly,
pretreatment LC reliably predicts chemotherapy efficacy
in high-risk patients. Therefore, based on its easy
attainability, pretreatment LC might be used to select
patients with high-risk disease, evaluate intensified
therapy, and develop novel agents to improve patient
outcome.
