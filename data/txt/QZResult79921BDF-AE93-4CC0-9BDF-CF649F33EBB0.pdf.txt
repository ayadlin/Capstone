ABSTRACT
Inhibition of angiogenesis is a promising therapeutic strategy against cancer. In
this study, we reported that ZLM-7, a combretastain A-4 (CA-4) derivative, exhibited
anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, ZLM-7 induced microtubule
cytoskeletal disassembly. It decreased VEGF-induced proliferation, migration, invasion
and tube formation in endothelial cells, which are critical steps in angiogenesis.
In vivo, ZLM-7 significantly inhibited neovascularization in a chicken chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM) model and reduced the microvessel density in tumor tissues of
MCF-7 xenograft mouse model. ZLM-7 also displayed comparable antiangiogenic and
anti-tumor activities associated with the lead compound CA-4, but exhibited lower
toxicity compared with CA-4. The anti-angiogenic effect of ZLM-7 was exerted via
blockade of VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling. ZLM-7 treatment suppressed the expression
and secretion of VEGF in endothelial cells and MCF-7 cells under hypoxia. Further,
ZLM-7 suppressed the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and its downstream
signaling mediators including activated AKT, MEK and ERK in endothelial cells. Overall,
these results demonstrate that ZLM-7 exhibits anti-angiogenic activities by impairing
endothelial cell function and blocking VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling, suggesting that ZLM-7
might be a potential angiogenesis inhibitor.

μm [7]. Angiogenesis involves several steps, including
degradation of the surrounding extracellular matrix,
migration of endothelial cells, proliferation of endothelial
cells and transformation of endothelial cells into tubular
structures [8].
Of the nearly 30 known endogenous pro-angiogenic
factors, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is
the predominant [9, 10]. VEGF stimulates numerous steps
in tumor angiogenesis such as endothelial cell proliferation,
migration and invasion, and is elevated in many solid tumors
[11, 12]. Preclinical studies indicate that inhibition of VEGF
signaling reduces tumor growth [13]. Vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is the most important
receptor in VEGF-induced angiogenesis [14]. VEGFR2
phosphorylation triggers downstream signaling cascade in
endothelial cells [15–17]. Interruption of VEGF-VEGFR2

BACKGROUND
Solid tumors account for more than 90% of cancers
depending on the vascular network [1, 2]. Strategies that
disrupt pre-existing vasculature block the blood supply
or inhibit specific steps in angiogenesis [3]. Individual
agents might possess both vascular disrupting and antiangiogenic activities [4]. It has been reported recently
that microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) are the most
effective drugs exhibiting vascular-disrupting and antiangiogenic activities [5].
Angiogenesis, the outgrowth of new capillaries from
pre-existing blood vessels, is associated with the growth
and progression of solid tumors [6]. Most solid tumors
cannot grow beyond 1-2 mm3 in size without angiogenesis
because the tissue oxygen diffusion limit is 100-200

signaling pathway is a therapeutic target in tumor angiogenesis
and solid tumor growth [18]. Disruption of microtubules may
also downregulate VEGFR2 expression [19].
One of the most potent MTAs is combretastatin A-4
(CA-4). CA-4 is currently undergoing clinical evaluation
as a vascular disrupting agent [20]. It has strong affinity
to tubulin leading to cytoskeletal destabilization [21].
However, the cis-configuration of CA-4 isomerizes to the
more thermally stable trans-isomer, resulting in a dramatic
decrease in activity [22]. Therefore, many derivatives with
increased stability were designed and synthesized [23]. In
a previous study, we developed a series of cis-restricted
sulfide derivatives of CA-4, including ZLM-7 (Figure 1)
exhibiting comparable anti-cancer activity to CA-4. In the
present study, we evaluate the anti-angiogenic and antitumor activities of ZLM-7, and investigated its effect in
VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling.

found similar results with the microtubule network and
morphology of HUVECs.
Given the correlation between G2/M-phase arrest
and tubulin polymerization [27], we examined the effect
of ZLM-7 on the cell cycle by flow cytometry. Our data
showed that ZLM-7 treatment induced a dose-dependent
accumulation of cells in the G2/M-phase, with a reduction
in the proportion of cells in G1-phase (Figure 3A and 3B).
Similar results were obtained with CA-4.

ZLM-7 reduced proliferation of HUVECs
Proliferation of HUVECs was detected by MTT
assay to examine the anti-angiogenic effects of ZLM-7
in vitro. ZLM-7 and CA-4 inhibited the proliferation of
HUVECs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner
(Figure 4A). Approximately 50% reduction in cell number
at the concentration of 10 nM after 48 h incubation was
found relative to untreated cells. The results presented in
Figure 4B showed that both ZLM-7 and CA-4 significantly
suppressed VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation in
a dose-dependent manner. The effect of ZLM-7 and CA-4
on HUVEC proliferation was similar.
To further evaluate the cytotoxicity of ZLM-7 on
HUVECs, clonogenic assay, LDH cytotoxicity assay and
Annexin V-FITC staining apoptosis assay were carried
out. Results displayed in Figure 4C indicate that ZLM-7
was less toxic than CA-4 in the clonogenic assay. ZLM-7
was also found to induce fewer toxic effects than CA-4
on HUVECs visualized by LDH release (Figure 4D). As
indicated in Figure 4E, the number of apoptostic cells
was less in the ZLM-7-treated group compared with CA4-treated group. The above results indicate that ZLM-7
exhibited lower cytotoxicity compared with CA-4 in
HUVECs.

RESULTS
ZLM-7 disassembled microtubule network and
induced G2/M phase arrest in HUVECs
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
play a key role in vascular sprouting. They are often used
to investigate anti-angiogenic activity of drugs, in vitro
[24, 25]. The microtubule network controls cell division
and migration, maintenance of cell shape, intracellular
trafficking of cell signaling in eukaryotic cells, and
therefore, is required in angiogenesis [26]. To characterize
the effect of ZLM-7 on microtubule cytoskeleton of
HUVECs, immunofluorescent staining of β-tubulin was
performed. Figure 2A showed that ZLM-7 treatment led
to a diffuse microtubule network. In the control group,
the microtubule network exhibited normal organization
and arrangement of HUVECs. However, exposure to
ZLM-7 (1-100 nM) caused microtubule disassembly
and disappearance of microtubule polymerization at the
cell periphery. The effects of the ZLM-7 on HUVEC
morphology were also studied. We found that after
24 h of exposure to ZLM-7 at as low as 1 nM, cells
became rounded, accompanied by membrane blebbing
(Figure 2B). For comparison, we evaluated the effects
of CA-4 under similar experimental conditions and

ZLM-7 inhibited HUVECs migration, invasion
and tube formation
Endothelial cell migration and invasion are key steps
in angiogenesis [28]. To investigate the effect of ZLM-7
in endothelial cell migration, we used a wound-healing
migration assay by mechanically scraping a clear space
on HUVEC confluent monolayer for migration of motile

cells. We observed that control cells almost completely
migrated to fill in the initial clear area after 24 h, while
ZLM-7 treatment significantly reduced the VEGF-induced
migration of HUVECs in a concentration- and timedependent manner (Figure 5A). In a Matrigel invasion
assay, ZLM-7 also induced a dose-dependent suppression
in the VEGF-induced invasion of HUVECs (Figure 5B).
We further evaluated the inhibitory effects of ZLM-7 on
endothelial tube formation, which is also a well known
in vitro angiogenesis test [29]. As shown in Figure 5C,
VEGF stimulation resulted in a rich network of branched
capillary-like tubes 2 h after cells seeding on Matrigel.
In the presence of ZLM-7, the capillary-like tubes were
interrupted at lower concentrations (5 nM). Most cells
formed spherical aggregates at higher concentrations
(10, and 20 nM). In these experiments, we barely detected
the difference between ZLM-7 and CA-4 (data not shown).

We evaluated the ex vivo anti-angiogenic activity of
ZLM-7 based on capillary sprouting from aortic rings [30].
Microvessels emerging from cultured rat aorta embedded
in Matrigel, mimic several stages of angiogenesis,
including endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube
formation. As a result, the rat aortic ring assay simulates
angiogenesis in vivo. The results showed that the control
group formed a large number of microvessel structures
in six-day-old cultures. However, 5 nM ZLM-7 notably
suppressed the formation of microvessels and 20 nM
ZLM-7 completely blocked microvessel sprouting from
rat aortic rings (Figure 6A).
Next, we employed the popular CAM assay,
which provides a unique in vivo model to investigate
the anti-angiogenic effect of agents [31]. As shown in

Figure 2: Effect of ZLM-7 on cytoskeleton and morphology in HUVECs. A. Cells were treated for 24 h with ZLM-7 or CA-4,

Figure 6B, normally developed CAMs in control were
angiogenic, inducing a number of branches and new
capillaries from the exiting basal vessels, whereas ZLM7 blocked this angiogenesis. After 48 h of treatment
with 5 and 10 nmol, ZLM-7 significantly impaired
neovascularization accompanied by absence of vascular
networks. Quantitative analysis revealed that 1, 5 and 10
nmol ZLM-7 caused 27.3%, 42.6% and 71.5% reduction
in the number of blood vessels, respectively. These effects
of ZLM-7 were similar to that of the lead compound CA-4
(data not shown).

both in HUVECs and MCF-7 cells, the amount of VEGF
and HIF-1αprotein increased under hypoxia compared
with normoxic conditions. ZLM-7 treatment decreased
protein expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
7A and 7B). The secretion of VEGF was also increased
in HUVECs and MCF-7 cells in hypoxia, whereas it was
dramatically decreased after ZLM-7 treatment (Figure 7C
and 7D).

ZLM-7 inhibited hypoxia-induced VEGF and
HIF-1α expression

VEGF induces angiogenesis by stimulating the
proliferation, migration and sprouting of endothelial
cells via binding to VEGFR2 [15]. We further evaluated
the effects of ZLM-7 on the VEGF2 and its downstream
signaling pathways. As shown in Figure 7E, the total
VEGFR2 expression level decreased upon treatment with
ZLM-7. VEGF stimulated VEGFR2 phosphorylation,
which was inhibited by ZLM-7. VEGF also activated

ZLM-7 suppressed VEGFR2 activation and its
downstream signaling pathways

VEGF is a pro-angiogenic factor induced by
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), under hypoxic
conditions [9, 32]. We investigated the effects of ZLM-7
on VEGF and HIF-1α protein expression under hypoxic
conditions for 12 h by Western blot. Our data revealed that

in a dose-dependent manner. However, the total expression
of these proteins was almost unaffected.

body weight (P < 0.05), which suggested that ZLM-7 was
less toxic than CA-4.
We further investigated whether ZLM-7 inhibited
angiogenesis in tumor, via immunohistochemistry with
anti-CD31 antibody to stain solid tumor sections. CD31 is
present on most capillaries and is a widely used endothelial
marker for quantifying angiogenesis [33]. ZLM-7 treatment
markedly reduced the development of newly formed vessels
in tumors (Figure 8D). The mean vessel density in tumors
treated with ZLM-7 and CA-4 was reduced to 62.7% and
60.2%, respectively (Figure 8E).
As shown in Figure 8F, H&E staining revealed
that ZLM-7 therapy significantly elevated tumor
necrosis. In addition, ZLM-7 induced no apparent
pathological abnormalities in normal tissues including
liver, spleen and kidney (Figure 8G). Consistent with
our in vitro data, ZLM-7 treatment strongly decreased
the HIF-1α, VEGF and VEGFR2 protein expression
levels (Figure 8H).

ZLM-7 inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis
in a MCF-7 mouse xenograft model
To elucidate the anti-tumor effects of ZLM-7
in vivo, we used an MCF-7 breast xenograft mouse
model. In this experiment, 15 mg/kg ZLM-7 or CA-4 was
administrated i.p. daily for 3 weeks. The results showed
that ZLM-7 therapy significantly suppressed the growth
of MCF-7 subcutaneous tumor (Figure 8A and 8B).
The relative tumor volume in ZLM-7 and CA-4 group
decreased 65.8% and 56.0%, respectively. Meanwhile,
ZLM-7 treatment did not significantly decrease the
mouse body weight compared with control (P > 0.05)
(Figure 8C). Further, CA-4 significantly decreased the

DISCUSSION

VEGF, VEGF-stimulated migration, invasion and vessellike tube formation of endothelial cells. In addition, in
an ex vivo rat aortic arch model, the sprouting of ZLM7-treated aorta was scattered compared with the control.
Nevertheless, the above in vitro and ex vivo models lack the
biological complexity of vascular system in vertebrates.
Evidence supporting in vivo anti-angiogenic effects
of ZLM-7 is derived from the chicken chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM) and the MCF-7 xenograft mouse
model. ZLM-7 obviously reduced the neovascularization
on CAM and significantly suppressed tumor growth
accompanied by reduced microvessel density (MVD)
in tumor tissues of the MCF-7 xenograft model. ZLM7 also induced minor toxic effects in endothelial cells at
concentrations that significantly inhibited angiogenesis
in vitro. In addition, no body weight loss or toxicity was
observed in normal tissues of the ZLM-7 treated mouse
xenograft model. Interestingly, ZLM-7 showed similar
antiangiogenic and anti-tumor activities with the lead
compound CA-4, whereas it exhibited lower toxicity
compared with CA-4. These results indicated that ZLM7 may be an angiogenesis inhibitor with limited toxicity.

CA-4 is one of the latest additions to the anticancer
drug candidates undergoing phase III clinical trials.
Previous structure–activity relationship studies (SAR)
of CA-4 confirmed that the cis-orientation of the
diaryl groups was essential for its strong cytotoxicity.
However, this compound is intrinsically unstable
due the isomerisation of the cis-isomer into a more
thermodynamically stable but inactive trans-isomer [34].
To circumvent the problem of cis-trans isomerization,
chemically stable cis-restricted derivatives of CA-4 were
obtained by incorporating the olefinic double bond with
one-atom or five-member aromatic heterocyclic rings
[35, 36]. In our previous studies, we identified ZLM-7
as the most active compound among a series of sulfide
derivatives of CA-4. In this study, we unraveled the antiangiogenic and anti-tumor activities of ZLM-7.
We found that ZLM-7 inhibited angiogenesis both
in vitro and in vivo. ZLM-7, at nanomolar concentrations,
dramatically inhibited angiogenesis-associated activities
including proliferation with or without stimulation by

Microtubule cytoskeleton controls cell cycle
progression, cell proliferation and cell migration [26, 37]. In
this study, we found that ZLM-7 disrupted the microtubule
cytoskeleton of endothelial cells. Inhibition of microtuble
polymerization resulted in cell cycle arrest in various cell
lines [27]. We also found that ZLM-7 induced G2/M-phase
arrest in endothelial cells. These findings strongly suggested
that the morphological changes caused by ZLM-7 might be
correlated with endothelial function in angiogenesis.
Microtubules also affect signal transduction
pathways in cells [38]. We investigated the intrinsic
molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-angiogenic
activities of ZLM-7. In tumors, the microenvironment is
predominantly hypoxic [39]. Tumor growth is induced
via transcription and secretion of pro-angiogenic factors
controlled by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) resulting in
an angiogenic phenotype [40]. VEGF expression is induced
by HIF-1 in response to hypoxia [41, 42]. In this study,
we found that ZLM-7 suppressed HIF-1α expression, and
VEGF expression and secretion in HUVECs and MCF-7
cells under hypoxia. The results are consistent with the
results of microtubule disrupting drugs, which inhibit
tumor angiogenesis via the HIF-1 pathway [43–45].
These results suggested that ZLM-7 might inhibit tumor
angiogenesis via paracrine and autocrine VEGF pathways.
The angiogenic response to VEGF occurs mainly
via activation of VEGFR2 [46, 47]. In the present study,
we demonstrated that ZLM-7 suppressed the expression of
total and phosphorylated VEGFR2 stimulated by VEGF.
ZLM-7 also inhibits multiple VEGFR2 downstream
signaling mediators such as activated AKT, MEK and
ERK. AKT is responsible for the proliferation and survival
of endothelial cells; MEK and ERK activation results in
increased proliferation and migration of endothelial cells
[9]. In addition, the findings in vivo were consistent with
our in vitro results, indicating that the reduced MVD
in tumors may be related to ZLM-7 suppression of the
expression of HIF-1α, VEGF and VEGFR-2. All these
results suggested that ZLM-7 treatment inhibited tumor
angiogenesis by suppression of the VEGF-VEGFR2
signaling pathway.
In conclusion, our data indicate that ZLM-7 exerts
similar antiangiogenic and anti-tumor effects with low
toxicity compared with CA-4. ZLM-7 represents a
promising candidate as angiogenesis inhibitor.

Then, both the floating and adhesive cells were collected
and fixed with ice-cold 75 % ethanol (4 °C, overnight).
After ethanol removal, the cells were stained with a cell
cycle analysis kit (containing 1 mg/mL PI and 10 mg/mL
RNase A) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Cell
cycle distribution was determined using a FACScan flow
cytometer (BD FACS Calibur).

following the drug addition, the cells were photographed
under a light microscope. The wound width was measured
and the percent of gap closure was calculated.

In vitro chemoinvasion assay
A 24-well plate transwell chamber with 8.0 μm
pore sized polycarbonate filter inserts from Corning
Costar (Coring, NY, USA) was used. The upper side
was coated with 30 μL Matrigel. After 1 × 105 HUVECs
were placed in M199 medium containing 1% FBS and
vehicle or ZLM-7 in the upper compartment of the filter,
the lower chamber was filled with medium M199 (1 %
FBS) containing 20 ng/mL VEGF as a chemoattractant.
The chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells
on the lower side of the filter membrane were then fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet and
photographed microscopically.

Cell proliferation assay
HUVECs in 96-well plates were allowed to adhere
overnight followed by addition of ZLM-7 or CA-4 within
a concentration range of 1 to 100 nM in the presence
or absence of VEGF (20 ng/mL). After appropriate
incubation, the cell proliferation was measured using
a 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2Htetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay.

Colony forming assay

Tube formation assay

HUVECs plated in 6-well plates were allowed
to adhere for 12h. After treatment with different
concentrations of ZLM-7 or CA-4 for 4 h, the medium
was refreshed and cells were cultured for 2 weeks to
obtain colonies (replacing culture medium every 2 days).
Subsequently, the cells were briefly washed with PBS,
stained with crystal violet and photographed. Colonies of
>50 cells were counted visually.

We seeded 2×104 HUVECs in complete medium
containing vehicle or ZLM-7 and 20 ng/mL VEGF on
polymerized Matrigel, in 96-well plates. After incubation
for 2 h, the cells were photographed under microscopy.
The effect of the drugs on capillary tube formation was
calculated by measuring the length of cell network.

Aortic ring assay

LDH toxicity assay

The 48-well plates were covered with 100 μl
Matrigel. Aortic rings obtained from 6-week-old male
Sprague-Dawley rats were rinsed five times with the
M199 medium, sectioned into 1 mm-long cross sections
and placed on the surface of Matrigel in wells and covered
with an additional 60 μl Matrigel. The rings were cultured
in 0.4 mL M199 medium containing 20% FBS and either
vehicle or various concentration of ZLM-7. Each group
contained six aortic rings. The medium was replaced every
2 days. After 6 days of incubation at 37°C, the microvessel
growth was photographed microscopically.

The cytotoxicity of ZLM-7 was determined by
measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
activity into the medium. HUVECs were seeded in 96-well
plates and allowed to adhere for 12h. After incubation with
ZLM-7 or CA-4 for 48 h, cell supernatants were collected
and analyzed for LDH activity using LDH cytotoxicity
assay kit from Beyotime (Shanghai, China).

Apoptosis assay
The effects of ZLM-7 on cellular apoptosis were
analyzed using Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection
Kit. After incubation overnight, HUVECs were treated
with ZLM-7 or CA-4 for 48 h. The cells were stained with
Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min.
The apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACS
Calibur).

CAM assay
Groups of 10 fertilized chicken eggs were incubated
at 37.8 °C and 60–70 % relative humidity for 8 days. The
chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) was separated
from the shell membrane by drilling a small hole on
the broad end of the egg and another hole at a position
90° from the first. A 1 cm2 window was removed from
the eggshell immediately over the second hole and the
membrane was carefully pushed down to detach the CAM
from the shell. Sterilized filter paper disk (5 × 5 mm)
saturated with either vehicle or ZLM-7 (1, 5 or 10 nmoL/
egg) was placed on the CAM. The windows were sealed
with cellophane tape and the eggs were further incubated
for 48 h. After incubation, the papers were removed

Motility assay
HUVECs were seeded in 6-well plates. After
a confluent monolayer was formed, the cells were
mechanically wounded using a pipette tip. The wells were
then rinsed with PBS to remove the dislodged cells and
added M199 medium with 1% FBS and VEGF (20 ng/mL)
containing vehicle or ZLM-7. At indicated time points

points in each photo.

were quantified in five arbitrarily selected fields from
each tumor.

Statistical analysis

Western blot analysis

The data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 16.0
software. The Student’s t-test was used between two
groups and the differences were considered significant at
P-values < 0.05.

HUVECs or MCF-7 cells were incubated in the
presence or absence of ZLM-7 under indicated conditions
and were then collected. Total protein extracts were obtained
by lysing cells in cold RIPA buffer containing a proteinase
inhibitor and a phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C.
The cell lysates were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes. Membranes were blocked and immunolabeled
overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against VEGF,
HIF-1α, GAPDH, total and phosphorylated VEGFR2, AKT,
ERK and MEK. The membranes were then incubated with
secondary antibodies. Immunolabeling was visualized using
the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system
(GE healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

ELISA assay
VEGF secretion was measured in HUVECs and
MCF-7 cells using a VEGF immunoassay kit from
Research & Diagnostics Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN,
USA). Cells were incubated with or without 10 nM ZLM7 for 24 h under indicated conditions. After treatment, the
supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm
for 20 min at 4 °C. VEGF protein levels were determined
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

1 × 107 MCF-7 cells were injected subcutaneously
into the right flank of female Balb/c nu/nu mice. Mice
were randomly divided into two groups (n = 5) and
treated intraperitoneally with ZLM-7 or CA-4 (15 mg/kg/
day) when the tumors reached about 100 mm3. The body
weight and tumor size of each mouse every other day
was recorded. Solid tumor volume (V) was determined
by measuring the longest diameter (A) and shortest
diameter (B) of the tumor using digital vernier caliper
measurements and calculated as follows: V = (A × B2)/2.
After sacrificing mice on day 21, the tumors and normal
tissues were harvested for molecular assessment.
Excised tumors and normal tissues were fixed
in 10% buffered formalin solution and embedded in
paraffin. Histological assessment was conducted by
staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to investigate
the induction of necrosis and analyze the toxicity. The
tumor sections were immunohistochemically stained
with anti-CD31, anti-HIF-1α, anti-VEGF and antiVEGFR2 antibodies. Microvessels stained with CD31
