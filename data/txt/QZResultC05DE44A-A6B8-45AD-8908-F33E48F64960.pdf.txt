Abstract
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy with extremely high mortality due to the appearance of widespread metastases early in its clinical course and rapid acquisition of chemoresistance after initial
therapy. A theory of cell adhesion–mediated drug resistance is thought to be a principal mechanism in which
extracellular matrix proteins provide a survival advantage against cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis. We found
that the tetraspanin family member CD9 was expressed preferentially in SCLC tumors and metastases from
three of seven relapsed patients, whereas chemonaïve primary tumors from 16 patients were CD9 negative
with only one exception. Additionally, CD9 was highly expressed on SCLC cell lines rendered resistant to cisplatin or etoposide, and was upregulated in parental chemosensitive cells within 48 hours after exposure to
either of these compounds. CD9-expressing chemoresistant SCLC cells adhered more tightly to fibronectin via
β1 integrin, but they were less motile than the respective chemosensitive parental lines. Notably, treatment of
the chemoresistant cells with chemokine CXCL12 downregulated CD9 and transiently restored motility. Moreover, selective targeting of CD9 by treatment with specific monoclonal antibody ALB6 or a small interfering
RNA triggered apoptosis in the chemoresistant cells. Taken together, our findings implicate CD9 in the cell
adhesion–mediated drug resistance mechanism, highlighting CD9 as an attractive therapeutic target to improve therapeutic outcomes in SCLC. Cancer Res; 70(20); 8025–35. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide. Approximately 15% of all histologic types consist
of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that ultimately bears poor
outcome. The extreme aggressiveness of SCLC is due to its
unique biological characteristic; namely it metastasizes microscopically to systemic organs even in the early stages
and often recurs with a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype shortly after dramatic response to initial treatments,
which is achieved in approximately 80% of cases (1, 2). It
is noticeable for several molecular target drugs including
gefitinib, erlotinib, cetuximab, and bevacizumab to have
shown survival benefit in non-SCLC (3–7). However, no fa-

vorable therapeutic strategy has been established in recurrent SCLC to date. Development of novel drugs that
overcome MDR and bring about significant survival benefit
is urgently desired in SCLC.
Two well-characterized drug efflux pumps, P-glycoprotein
and MDR-related protein, have been thought to be crucial for
MDR of SCLC, but the importance of this mechanism is still
controversial because ectopic overexpression of these pumps
could induce partial resistance compared with the level
achieved by long-term drug selection (8, 9). Clinical studies
also revealed that expression of these pumps was not common and did not necessarily correlate with outcome in SCLC
(10, 11). Therefore, these molecules cannot completely account for MDR of SCLC and substitutable mechanisms must
be involved in the process.
SCLC cells exist in an extracellular matrix (ECM)–rich environment in vivo, and an interaction between the tumor and
the host microenvironment is central for their survival and
proliferation. Sethi and colleagues proposed the concept of
cell adhesion–mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) as a principal mechanism for SCLC cells to acquire the MDR phenotype. They showed that β1 integrin–mediated adhesion of
SCLC cells to ECM protects them from chemotherapyinduced apoptosis through activation of several intracellular
proteins (12, 13). Kraus and colleagues showed that chemoresistance of SCLC correlates with adhesion to ECM
and constitutive activation of Akt and mitogen-activated
protein kinase pathways (14). We also reported that adhesion

of SCLC cells to fibronectin enhanced their viability and cytoskeletal function mainly by activating phosphatidylinositol3-kinase and p125 focal adhesion kinase (15). Tsurutani and
colleagues showed that laminin-mediated activation of the
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway also enabled
SCLC cells to escape from imatinib-induced apoptosis (16).
Furthermore, Hodkinson and colleagues elucidated that interaction with ECM prevented SCLC cells from etoposideinduced G2-M cell cycle arrest by overriding the upregulation
of p21Cip1/WAF1 and p27Kip1, and the downregulation of cyclins E, A, and B (17). The importance of the CAM-DR mechanism has been also reported in various malignancies other
than SCLC (18–22).
Tetraspanin is the generic term for the glycoprotein family
containing four transmembrane domains. Members of this
family form multimeric complexes with one another and other
cell surface proteins including integrins, leukocyte antigens,
and signaling molecules at specialized tetraspanin-enriched
microdomains. As organizer, stabilizer, and facilitator of
these molecular networks termed the “tetraspanin web,”
tetraspanins regulate cellular morphology, motility, fusion,
and intracellular signals (23, 24). Among more than 30
members in mammals, CD9 was identified as a molecule
that suppresses cellular motility and metastatic potential
in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (25, 26). Clinicopathologic findings indicated that CD9 is a predictor for
better prognosis in adenocarcinoma of the lung (27, 28).
However, the biological relevance of CD9 in SCLC has
not been well understood thus far. We reported that
CD9 was absent in chemonaïve tumors at the primary site
in SCLC patients as well as in the majority of SCLC cell
lines, and that ectopic overexpression of CD9 suppressed
their motility (29). This evidence prompted us to investigate whether CD9 was involved in the advance of the disease and the CAM-DR mechanism and whether CD9 could
then be a therapeutic target to overcome MDR in SCLC.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture
SCLC cell lines SBC-3 (30), SBC-3/CDDP (31), and SBC-3/
ETP (32) were kindly provided by Dr. K. Kiura, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan. NCI-H69 (H69) was purchased from
American Type Culture Collection. H69/CDDP (33) and H69/
VP (34) were obtained from National Cancer Center, Tokyo,
Japan. H69/CD9 and SBC-3/CD9, which stably overexpress
ectopic CD9, were established as described previously (29).
All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin
(100 units/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL).
Antibodies
Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against CD9, clones 72F6
(Novocastra Laboratories), MM2/57 (Biosource International),
and ALB6 (Immunotech), were used as indicated in each experiment. The mAbs for β1 integrin (4B4), β-actin (C4), and
poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP; 46D11) were purchased
from Beckman Coulter, MP Biomedicals, and Cell Signaling

Technology, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against
phosphorylated or regular extracellular signal–regulated
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated
protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase, and Akt were available from Cell Signaling Technology.
Normal mouse IgG1 (Thermo Scientific) was used as a control
in several experiments.
Reagents
Nippon Kayaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan) supplied us with cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide (VP-16). SN-38, the active form
of irinotecan, and amrubicin were provided by Yakult Co.
(Tokyo, Japan) and Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. (Osaka,
Japan), respectively. Recombinant human CXCL12 was purchased from R&D Systems.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunoperoxidase procedures were carried out as described elsewhere (29). After antigen retrieval, inactivation
of endogenous peroxidase, and blockade of any nonspecific
reaction, the sections were subjected to immunoreaction
with primary anti-CD9 mAb 72F6 (diluted 1:400) overnight
at 4°C and subsequently incubated with goat anti-mouse
IgG biotinylated secondary antibody (diluted 1:300; Dako)
for 10 minutes at room temperature and then labeled with
streptavidin-peroxidase complex. They were developed and
counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin.
Flow cytometry
Cells (1 × 104) were incubated with 10 μg of primary mAb
or normal mouse IgG1 for 30 minutes at 4°C followed by labeling with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Biosource). Stained cells were analyzed by FACScan (Becton
Dickinson).
Reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells by the Isogen method
(Nippon Gene), 1 μg of which was reverse-transcribed using
the cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Generated cDNAs were
amplified with the following forward and reverse primer sets:
CD9 (5′-TGCATCTGTATCCAGCGCCA-3′ and 5′-CTCAGGGATGTAAGCTGACT-3′) and β-actin (5′-TGAACCCTAAGGCCAACCGTG-3′ and 5′-GCTCA TAGCTCTTCTCCAGGG-3′).
Using TaKaRa Ex Taq Hot Start Version (Takara Bio), the reaction mixtures were subjected to 30 amplification cycles with
30 seconds of denaturing at 94°C, 30 seconds of annealing at
60°C (CD9) and 61°C (β-actin), and a 60-second extension at
72°C. These primer pairs for CD9 and β-actin amplified 799 bp
and 397 bp fragments, respectively. Amplicons were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium
bromide.
Immunoblotting
Whole cell lysates were separated in a 10% to 20% gradient
gel (Wako) by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions,
transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) as described previously (35). Proteins were immunoblotted with
proper primary antibodies (diluted 1:500–1,000) followed by

Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent technique with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce).

Regulation of CD9 expression
Cells (1 × 106) were treated with CDDP or VP-16 at various concentrations (≈ IC50 and ≈2 × IC50 for respective
parental clone) for 48 hours (Fig. 1D) or incubated in the
presence (100 ng/mL) or absence of CXCL12 for 6 hours

mAb 72F6 from a representative SCLC patient. No immunoreactive CD9 is detectable in pretreated specimens from the primary site (a). In pathologically
dissected tissues, CD9 is positive in the relapsed primary tumor (b), metastasized mediastinal lymph nodes (c), and the liver (d). B, CD9 is upregulated
exclusively in chemoresistant cells at transcriptional (top) and protein (bottom) levels. C, FACS analysis confirms that CD9 is properly expressed on the cell
surface of chemoresistant clones and CD9 transfectants. D, exposure of H69 and SBC-3 to various concentrations (≈ IC50 and ≈2 × IC50) of CDDP or
VP-16 for 48 h induces transcriptional upregulation of CD9.

and FACS) then cultured for another 72 hours.

Drug sensitivity assays
Cells (5 × 103/well) were plated onto 96-well tissue culture–
treated plates (Sumitomo Bakelite) and treated with serially
diluted cytotoxic compounds in serum-containing medium
for 120 hours. The relative number of viable cells was quantified by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay as described previously (15, 36).

Statistical analysis
All the studies for statistical evaluation were performed in
triplicate in each experiment and repeated at least three times.
Mean ± SD values were calculated and differences were evaluated by two-sided Welch's t test using Statcel-12 software
(OMS). P < 0.05 values were considered statistically significant.

Results
Adhesion assay
Cellular adhesive potential was evaluated as mentioned in
our previous reports (15, 29, 36). Briefly, the wells of a 96-well
plate (Linbro) were precoated with 10 μg/mL of human plasma fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4°C. After blocking nonspecific binding sites with RPMI 1640 containing 0.1%
(w/v) bovine serum albumin, cells (5 × 104/well) were allowed
to adhere with 1 μg/mL of 4B4 or control IgG1 for 6 hours
(H69 series) or 1 hour (SBC-3 series) at 37°C. The relative
number of attached cells was determined by MTT assay.
Cell motility analysis by timelapse video microscopy
Cells (2 × 105) plated in fibronectin-coated 35-mm dishes
(Corning) in serum-containing medium were untreated or
treated with 100 ng/mL of CXCL12. After 6 hours of preincubation to urge cells to adhere, dishes were placed into a
temperature- and humidity-controlled chamber (IX-IBM,
Olympus). Cells were recorded for another 8 hours by timelapse video microscopy (TLVM) using an inverted microscope (IX70, Olympus) equipped with a charge-coupled
device camera (Cool-Snap HQ cooled 12-bit; Roper Scientific). Digital video images were saved every 5 minutes and
cellular movement was analyzed with MetaMorph software
(Universal Imaging, Co.) and then plotted to show the trace
of movement. The mean distance that a cell traversed for
each 5-minute period was also calculated.
ALB6 treatment
Cells (1 × 104/well) were placed into 96-well plates (Sumitomo Bakelite) and then cultured either untreated or treated
with 25 μg/mL of antibodies (ALB6 or IgG 1 ) in serumcontaining medium. After 72 hours of treatment, cells were
subjected to cell death detection assay to determine the biological toxicity of antibodies. The values of nucleosome enrichment that represent the increase of apoptosis were
measured using Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS Kit (Roche
Diagnostics). In parallel, a 100 times larger scale (1 × 106 cells)
treatment with antibodies or cytotoxic drugs was also carried
out for immunoblotting.
Small interfering RNA treatment
Cells were transfected with either 40 nmol/L of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against human CD9 (SHF27A-0631) or
control cocktail RNAs (S30C-0126; B-Bridge International)
using LipofectAMINE RNAiMAX (Life Technologies). After
48 hours of incubation, cells were replated in serumcontaining medium (1 × 104/well of a 96-well plate for

CD9 is preferentially expressed in recurred and
metastasized SCLC tissues
To address CD9 expression in recurred and metastasized
SCLC tissues, immunohistochemistry was carried out in
matched pre/posttreatment samples from seven patients
who had undergone pathologic dissection. None of the pretreated primary tumors from these subjects showed immunoreactive CD9. Additional pretreatment samples from nine
other patients were also negative for CD9 (with only one exception). However, relapsed primary tumor, mediastinal
lymph nodes, and metastasized tumors in the liver were all
positive for CD9 staining in two patients, tissues from one of
whom are shown in Fig. 1A, and another patient also had CD9positive tumors in the liver. These findings suggested that CD9
is involved in the disease progression and spread of SCLC.
CD9 is upregulated by exposure to cytotoxic drugs in
SCLC cells
We next investigated CD9 expression in chemoresistant
SCLC clones established by long-term exposure to cytotoxic
agents. CD9 was upregulated at the transcriptional level
(Fig. 1B) and abundantly expressed on the cell surface
(Fig. 1C) in all resistant clones, but not in parental cells, even
without chemotherapeutic drugs. To clarify if cytotoxic
agents induce CD9 expression in chemosensitive SCLC cells,
transcripts for CD9 were analyzed by reverse transcriptionPCR after 48 hours of exposure to CDDP or VP-16 at approximately equal and double the concentrations of IC50. CD9 was
upregulated in both H69 and SBC-3 cells (Fig. 1D) but this effect was transient and abrogated by drug withdrawal (data
not shown), in which the precise mechanism is unknown.
These results suggested that chemotherapy upregulates CD9
in primarily sensitive SCLC cells rather than clonally selecting
intrinsically resistant CD9-positive cells during treatment.
CD9 is involved in but not essential for acquisition of
chemoresistance in SCLC cells
As SCLC often recurs with the MDR phenotype shortly after successful initial treatment, we carried out an MTT drug
sensitivity assay. Proliferation rates were not significantly different among all clones including CD9 transfectants in both
H69 and SBC-3 series (data not shown). H69/VP and SBC-3/
ETP lost sensitivity to amrubicin compared with parental
lines with IC50 (nmol/L) values of 286 ± 65.1 (versus 42.3 ±
5.50 for H69, P < 0.03) and 310 ± 35.1 (versus 18.7 ± 12.6
for SBC-3, P < 0.01), respectively. SBC-3/CDDP showed

cross-resistance towards all of VP-16 (IC50: 2,333 ± 416 versus
107 ± 11.6 for SBC-3, P < 0.01), amrubicin (IC50: 70.7 ± 13.0
versus 18.7 ± 12.6 for SBC-3, P < 0.01), and SN-38 (IC50: 23.3 ±
5.80 versus 1.13 ± 0.71 for SBC-3, P < 0.03). On the other hand,
CD9 transfectants did not become resistant to any drug
(Fig. 2). These data suggested that CD9 upregulation by chemotherapy might not be essential for the acquisition of drug
resistance but could be a result of cellular adaptation.
CD9 enhanced β1 integrin–mediated adhesion to
fibronectin in SCLC cells
Integrins are essential cell surface receptors for ECM from
which intercellular survival signals go downstream. Because
almost all SCLC cell lines express β1 integrin subunit (37),
and because fibronectin is one of the major ECM components and common substrates for integrins, adhesion assays
were performed to evaluate adhesive potential of SCLC
clones onto this ECM (Fig. 3). H69 cells usually grow as floating aggregates and a majority of them still kept floating even
in the presence of fibronectin with only 8.15 ± 3.25% attached
cells. In contrast, approximately half of both H69/CDDP
(48.2 ± 2.39%, P < 0.01) and H69/VP (50.0 ± 4.69%, P < 0.01)
adhered. Moreover, SBC-3 cells which usually grow in an
anchorage-dependent fashion significantly increased adhesive faculty when they became resistant to CDDP and VP-16
with attachment ratios ranging from 55.0 ± 9.16% to 83.6 ±
3.26% (P < 0.01) and 86.6 ± 4.47% (P < 0.01), respectively. Treatment with function-blocking anti-β1 integrin mAb (4B4)

completely canceled this phenomenon in H69/CDDP (7.25 ±
3.23%, P < 0.01) and H69/VP (7.47 ± 4.19%, P < 0.01) to the level
of H69 (8.64 ± 1.35%) and also markedly decreased the adhesive potential in all SBC-3/CDDP (28.7 ± 11.2%, P < 0.01), SBC3/ETP (33.0 ± 14.0%, P < 0.03), and SBC-3 (12.4 ± 9.08%,
P < 0.01). Ectopic overexpression of CD9 extremely enhanced
adhesion in both H69/CD9 (85.8 ± 2.75%, P < 0.01) and SBC-3/
CD9 (78.6 ± 5.08%, P < 0.01), which was abrogated by 4B4 (7.63 ±
0.70%, P < 0.01 and 25.4 ± 10.7%, P < 0.01, respectively). These
results showed that CD9 is one of the key molecules in β1
integrin–mediated cell adhesion.
CD9 and CXCL12 participate in the CAM-DR
mechanism regulating cell motility in SCLC
The tighter the cells attach to ECM, the less motile they
become in general. We compared the cellular motility of
SBC-3/CDDP, SBC-3/ETP, and SBC-3/CD9 with SBC-3 on fibronectin using TLVM. Movement distances (μm/5 min) of
10 randomly selected cells are shown in Fig. 4A. Not only
SBC-3/CDDP (0.65 ± 0.28, P < 0.005) and SBC-3/ETP (0.98 ±
0.47, P < 0.03) but also SBC-3/CD9 (0.63 ± 0.41, P < 0.005) were
significantly less motile than SBC-3 (2.12 ± 1.23). We previously reported that CXCR4, the unique receptor for a chemokine CXCL12, was commonly expressed in SCLC cell lines
and CXCL12 enhanced their motility (36). As all the clones
used here express similar amounts of CXCR4 (data not
shown), we tested if CXCL12 could restore the motility of
these resistant clones. Compared with the unstimulated

state, movement of SBC-3/CDDP (1.95 ± 1.23, P < 0.01) and
SBC-3/ETP (2.18 ± 1.01, P < 0.005) significantly increased to
the level of SBC-3 in response to CXCL12. On the other hand,
SBC-3 (3.35 ± 1.48, P = 0.059) and SBC-3/CD9 (0.83 ± 0.37,
P = 0.26) did not respond to CXCL12, probably due to extremely low or high expression of CD9, respectively. Of interest, transcripts for CD9 were markedly reduced by CXCL12
within 6 hours in SBC-3/CDDP and SBC-3/ETP with movement recovery, but were marginal in SBC-3/CD9 (Fig. 4B).
This effect did not last so long and CD9 transcriptional levels
returned to baseline after 24 hours (data not shown). We also
examined if CXCL12 treatment could affect the chemosensitivity of these cells. SBC-3/CDDP and SBC-3/ETP cells were
not resensitized even in the presence of CXCL12, probably
because its effect was transient (Fig. 4C).
These results could strongly support the CAM-DR theory
that motility of cancer cells increases up to a peak then goes
down again to the baseline, which forms a bell-shaped curve,
along with continuously increasing cell-ECM adhesion and
chemoresistance (38, 39). Upregulation of endogenous CD9
probably plays some important roles in CAM-DR mechanism
and exogenous CXCL12 may transiently, but dynamically,
regulate cellular motility by controlling CD9 expression in
SCLC (Fig. 4D).
Selective inhibition of CD9 induced the apoptosis of
chemoresistant SCLC cells
Because ALB6, a mAb against CD9, was reported to induce
apoptosis of CD9-expressing malignant cells (40), we also examined if selective targeting of CD9 by ALB6 or siRNA could
induce the apoptosis of chemoresistant SCLC cells. ALB6, but
not control IgG1, led to apoptotic cell death exclusively in
CD9-expressing cells coupled with cleavage of PARP. When
the extent of apoptosis was evaluated using an increase of
nucleosome enrichment index by cell death detection assay,
values for ALB6 and control IgG1 were 0.50 ± 0.32 versus 0.02 ±
0.04 (P < 0.05) in H69/CDDP, 0.52 ± 0.16 versus 0.00 ± 0.05
(P < 0.001) in H69/VP and −0.09 ± 0.18 versus −0.02 ± 0.02 in
H69 (N.S.), 0.79 ± 0.15 versus 0.04 ± 0.09 (P < 0.005) in SBC-3/
CDDP, 0.71 ± 0.27 versus 0.02 ± 0.04 (P < 0.03) in SBC-3/ETP,
and −0.02 ± 0.19 versus 0.03 ± 0.08 (N.S.) in SBC-3, respectively

(Fig. 5A). In terms of intracellular signaling, ALB6 induced
the phosphorylation of JNK/SAPK and p38 but not Akt and
ERK1/2 in SBC-3/CDDP cells within 10 minutes but the effect
was transient and disappeared by 30 minutes, which was consistent with the previous report (ref. 40; Fig. 5B).
We next examined the effect of siRNA-induced CD9 depletion on survival of chemoresistant clones. Immunoblot and
FACS analyses confirmed that CD9 was successfully ejected
from the cell surface at least from day 2 to day 5 (Fig. 6A).
Similar to ALB6, siRNA treatment also induced apoptosis exclusively in chemoresistant clones in parallel with cleavage of
PARP. When evaluated by MTT assay, the percentage of viable

Discussion
CD9 is a tetraspanin that is well characterized by its close
association with β1 integrin and its ability to reinforce its
diverse biological actions on cell adhesion, migration, motility, and survival via interaction with ECM (23, 24). We found
that CD9 was preferentially expressed on SCLC cells at relapsed primary tumors and metastasized organs in patients
who had received prior chemotherapy. Therefore, we hypothesized that CD9 upregulated by chemotherapy could participate in the progression and spread of SCLC.
An immunohistochemical study revealed high levels of immunoreactive ECM proteins in SCLC tissues. In tumor foci,
collagen IV and fibronectin are deposited in adjacent host
connective tissue; moreover, fibronectin and laminin are also
visible in SCLC cells, suggesting that they might directly synthesize some components of the local ECM (12, 41). The production of fibronectin was also observed in all SCLC cell lines
used in our experiments (data not shown). Thus, SCLC cells

Figure 4. CD9 and CXCL12 participate in the CAM-DR mechanism regulating cell motility in SCLC. A, cells plated on fibronectin were untreated or
treated with 100 ng/mL of CXCL12. After 6 h of preincubation, cells were recorded every 5 min for another 8 h by TLVM. Traces from 10 randomly selected
cells are shown at ×80 magnification. Cellular movement is also presented in graphs with variables of time (h) as the X-axis and the distance that a
cell traversed every 5 min (μm/5 min) as the Y-axis. B (top), columns, mean distances with (black) or without (white) CXCL12; bars, SD. *, P < 0.01 and

that CXCL12 downregulates CD9 in SBC-3–derived chemoresistant clones within 6 h. C, drug sensitivity in the presence (black) or absence (white) of
CXCL12 was tested and shown as in Fig. 2. D, schema of CAM-DR mechanism with hypothetical involvement of CD9 and CXCL12 is shown. Motility
(solid line and arrow) of cancer cells increases up to a peak then goes down again to the baseline level in company with continuous increase in
chemoresistance (gray arrow) and adhesive potential (dashed line and arrow). Upregulation of endogenous CD9 is probably involved in CAM-DR
mechanism (gradient gray zone) and exogenous CXCL12 may dynamically regulate cellular motility controlling CD9 expression (open arrows).

them a suitable microenvironment to support their proliferation and survival.
This evidence prompted us to study if CD9 is involved in
the CAM-DR mechanism and how SCLC cells use CD9 to
intensify this mechanism to circumvent chemotherapy-

induced apoptosis. According to our findings, CD9 expression
would consistently increase in parallel with augmentation of
chemoresistance from the initial escape from chemotherapymediated apoptosis to the ultimately resistant stage (Fig. 1).
Although CD9 might not be essential for the acquisition of
drug resistance but a result of cellular adaptation to protect
cells from chemotherapy-driven stress (Fig. 2), chemoresistant

clones adhered to fibronectin via β1 integrin significantly more
tightly than the respective parental clones in which CD9 was
strongly concerned (Fig. 3). Therefore, chemoresistant SCLC
cells probably strengthen survival signals from ECM in cooperation with upregulated CD9 in their local environment.
Based on the CAM-DR theory, stubborn adhesion to ECM
would make cancer cells less mobile but offer them integrinmediated survival advantage in the face of chemotherapy
(38, 39), and in this setting, upregulated CD9 might play a role
in strengthening this mechanism. Chemoresistant clones and
CD9 transfectants actually became less mobile than their respective parental cells (Fig. 4A and B). Conversely, loose adhesion to ECM would give cancer cells adequate mobility at the
sacrifice of increased susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis. It is necessary for chemoresistant SCLC cells to
restore motility to metastasize to new distant sites during
the “treatment holiday.” We have previously reported that
CXCL12 secreted from stroma in such organs as bone marrow
and lymph nodes enhanced the motility of SCLC cells and contributed to their site-specific metastasis to these organs (36).
The motility of chemoresistant clones transiently increased to
the level of parental cells in response to CXCL12 coupled with
downregulation of CD9 (Fig. 4A and B). To form de novo metastases without affecting their chemosensitivity, it is reasonable and advantageous for chemoresistant cells that biological
activity of CXCL12 on their motility and CD9 expression does
not last so long (Fig. 4C). Thus, CD9 and CXCL12 might dynamically regulate cellular motility to provide cancer cells
with suitable conditions spatially as well as temporally in
the CAM-DR mechanism (Fig. 4D).
Selective targeting of CD9 by ALB6 and siRNA both led CD9expressing SCLC cells to apoptotic cell death, suggesting that
CD9 is a regulator of cell survival (Figs. 5 and 6). Murayama
and colleagues reported that CD9 was commonly expressed
in cancer cells originating from the digestive system, including
stomach, colon and pancreas, and that ALB6 induced the apoptosis of these CD9-expressing cells coupled with transient
activation of JNK/SAPK and p38 (40), which was consistent
with our results in SCLC (Fig. 5B). ALB6 treatment of mice
bearing CD9-expressing human gastric cancer cells has been
recently shown to successfully inhibit tumor progression via
not only antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on malignant cells but also antiangiogenic effects on tumor vessels reducing microvessel density (42). Inhibitory effects of anti-CD9
mAb on in vivo tumorigenicity as well as in vitro proliferation
of human colon carcinoma cells has also been reported (43).
Regulation of tumor angiogenesis by ALB6 in vivo is likely and

acceptable because another anti-CD9 mAb (ALMA.1) inhibited human vascular endothelial cell migration toward ECM
proteins at wound lesion and impaired its repair (44). Because
targeting tumor vessels by bevacizumab provides advantages
over traditional antitumor approaches (7), the anti-CD9 antibody is an attractive tool targeting both tumor cells and vessels in one molecule.
Furthermore, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
might have participated in antitumor activity by anti-CD9
antibodies in vivo (42, 43), although the authors did not refer
to the matter. IgG1 subclass antibodies such as trastuzumab,
rituximab, and cetuximab are well known to preferentially
induce this immune reaction because they have longer
half-lives and could bind to all subtypes of FcγR on effector
cells (45–48). In this context, IgG1 antibody directed against
CD9 such as ALB6 is expected not only as an apoptosis inducer for cancer cells and inhibitor of angiogenesis but also
as a potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediator. Thus, targeting CD9 is still the more attractive option in
antitumor strategy.
Collectively, our present study clarified the molecular significance of CD9 in CAM-DR mechanism in SCLC. Moreover,
we showed the possibility of using this molecule as a novel
therapeutic target to overcome drug resistance especially in
the refractory stage. Finally, the implication of targeting CD9
for therapeutic strategies in SCLC is promising to bring
about better prognosis of this devastating malignancy and
is valuable for future clinical applications.
