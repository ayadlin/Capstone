Abstract

Author Manuscript

Signals from the tumor microenvironment trigger cancer cells to adopt an invasive phenotype
through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Relatively little is known regarding key signal
transduction pathways that serve as cytosolic bridges between cell surface receptors and nuclear
transcription factors to induce EMT. A better understanding of these early EMT events may
identify potential targets for the control of metastasis. One rapid intracellular signaling pathway
that has not yet been explored during EMT induction is calcium. Here we show that stimuli used
to induce EMT produce a transient increase in cytosolic calcium levels in human breast cancer
cells. Attenuation of the calcium signal by intracellular calcium chelation significantly reduced
epidermal growth factor (EGF)- and hypoxia-induced EMT. Intracellular calcium chelation also
inhibited EGF-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3),
while preserving other signal transduction pathways such as Akt and extracellular signal regulated
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. To identify calcium-permeable channels that may regulate
EMT induction in breast cancer cells, we performed a targeted siRNA-based screen. We found
that transient receptor potential-melastatin-like 7 (TRPM7) channel expression regulated EGFinduced STAT3 phosphorylation and expression of the EMT marker vimentin. While intracellular
calcium chelation almost completely blocked the induction of many EMT markers, including
vimentin, Twist and N-cadherin, the effect of TRPM7 silencing was specific for vimentin protein

expression and STAT3 phosphorylation. These results indicate that TRPM7 is a partial regulator
of EMT in breast cancer cells, and that other calcium-permeable ion channels are also involved in
calcium-dependent EMT induction. In summary, this work establishes an important role for the
intracellular calcium signal in the induction of EMT in human breast cancer cells. Manipulation of
calcium signaling pathways controlling EMT induction in cancer cells may therefore be an
important therapeutic strategy for preventing metastases.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) converts epithelial cells to a mesenchymal-like
phenotype and is associated with the loss of cell contacts, production of the type-III
intermediate filament protein vimentin, and increases in cell migration and invasion (1).
This phenotypic switch is important during embryonic development and for pathological
processes including the metastasis of solid tumors from the primary site to a secondary
organ (2, 3). In addition to increases in the expression of classic EMT markers including
Snail, Twist, vimentin and N-cadherin, EMT in breast cancer cells is associated with the
evasion of apoptosis and senescence, and anoikis resistance (3, 4). Expression of EMT
markers is a feature of the basal and claudin-low breast cancer subtypes, which have a poor
clinical prognosis (5–8), and has been associated with breast cancer stem cell activity (9).
EMT markers are also enriched in cancer cell populations surviving hormonal or cytotoxic
therapy (10).

Author Manuscript

Many studies have investigated the molecular and cellular changes that occur as a
consequence of EMT and how these changes may facilitate cancer cell dissemination and
metastasis (9, 11). Comparatively little is known about key signal transduction pathways
that govern the induction of EMT (12). In this study we used EGF and hypoxia to induce
EMT in MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells. EGF-mediated activation of the EGFR
produces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of multiple downstream signaling proteins,
and a STAT3-Twist signaling pathway has been implicated in EGF-induced EMT in these
cells (13). Therapeutic targeting of specific signaling pathways that regulate epithelialmesenchymal plasticity may offer a novel approach for the prevention of cancer metastasis
by inhibiting cellular conversions at the primary and/or secondary site. Identification of
early signaling events important for EMT induction may aid in the development of clinically
useful anti-metastatic therapies due to the inherent difficulties with targeting the
transcription factors already identified as EMT regulators (14).
The calcium signal is a mechanism well suited to the rapid translation of signals from the
tumor microenvironment into cellular responses (15–17). However, most studies
investigating a role for calcium signaling in cancer have focused on processes important for
the growth of the primary tumor (i.e. cell proliferation and apoptosis). For example,
inhibition of calcium-permeable TRPC3 channels, which are elevated in clinical epithelial

ovarian cancer samples, reduces the proliferation of SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells (18).
Calcium signaling is also important in the context of cancer cell migration and invasion
(reviewed in Ref 19). Examples of calcium-dependent migratory processes are evident in
prostate cancer cells, where silencing of the non-selective cation channel TRPV2 inhibits
cell migration, an effect likely attributable to a reduction in basal cytosolic calcium
concentrations (20). Pharmacological inhibition of store-operated calcium entry or silencing
of components of this calcium influx pathway (ORAI1 and STIM1) in invasive MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells inhibits cell migration, in-part through regulation of focal
adhesion turnover (21). We have previously characterized changes in non-stimulated and
store-operated calcium entry that occur as a consequence of EGF-induced EMT (22), and
other studies have shown enhanced store-operated calcium entry associated with
transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-induced EMT in breast cancer cells (23). In these
studies we sought to determine the role of calcium signaling in the induction of EMT in
breast cancer cells and to define the mechanisms involved.

RESULTS
Scratch-wounding initiates an intracellular calcium wave in breast cancer cells
Mechanical wounding promotes a migratory cell phenotype and induces the mesenchymal
marker vimentin in breast epithelial cells (24). To assess possible rapid changes in calcium
signaling as a consequence of wounding we scratched a confluent monolayer of MDAMB-468 human breast cancer cells. An immediate increase in free cytosolic calcium
([Ca2+]CYT) in cells adjacent to the scratch and the propagation of an intracellular calcium
wave emanating from the wound site was observed (Fig. 1A and Movie S1).

Author Manuscript

Quantitative analysis of scratch-induced calcium wave propagation was performed by fitting
the dependence of the cell activation time (Tf) on distance from the wound edge (D) by Tf =
A*Dn, where A and n are constants (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1). An n = 1 indicates propagation at
a constant speed 1/A, while n = 2 indicates a purely diffusive process with a diffusion
constant 1/A. The best-fitting value of n was 1.50 (R2 = 0.82), suggesting a mixed model of
calcium signaling following mechanical wounding that may involve intercellular
communication via gap junctions as well as IP3 receptor-mediated wave propagation,
transitioning to a mechanism of calcium wave propagation that is likely to involve the
release of a diffusible extracellular calcium-mobilizing agent. Support for a model of
calcium wave propagation involving the release of an extracellular agent was given by the
ability of conditioned media (from a scratched monolayer collected immediately after
wounding) to promote vimentin protein induction mediated by EGF (Fig. 1C).

EGF stimulation produces an intracellular calcium signal and induces EMT in MDA-MB-468
breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

EGF is a well characterised EMT inducer in MDA-MB-468 cells (12, 13, 25) and a factor
known to be released in the tumor microenvironment (26). The ability of EGF to increase
[Ca2+]CYT in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells was therefore evaluated. EGF induced a
transient increase in [Ca2+]CYT (Fig. 1D and E). Activation of the protease-activated
receptor 2 (PAR2) with trypsin and purinergic receptor activation with ATP also increased
[Ca2+]CYT (Fig. 1D and E). We then compared the ability of these agents to increase
[Ca2+]CYT with their ability to induce EMT, as assessed by increases in vimentin protein
expression. PAR2 and purinergic receptor activation, despite producing significantly higher
elevations in [Ca2+]CYT, failed to induce EMT in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 1F). These
findings are consistent with one of two scenarios—either EGF-induced EMT arises
independently of calcium signaling or the nature (e.g., spatial and temporal aspects (27)) of
the calcium signal elicited by EGF is of critical importance in the regulation of EMT
induction.
Intracellular calcium chelation inhibits EGF-induced EMT
To directly explore a role for the calcium signal in the induction of EMT, MDA-MB-468
cells were pre-treated with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM and the ability of
EGF to induce vimentin expression in the absence of increases in [Ca2+]CYT was assessed.
A significant and pronounced decrease in EGF-induced vimentin expression was observed
with intracellular calcium chelation (Fig. 2A). Induction of vimentin by EGF was also
inhibited by another intracellular calcium chelator EGTA-AM (Fig. 2B).

Author Manuscript

Intracellular calcium chelation (BAPTA-AM) also blocked EGF-induced increases in
mRNA levels of many EMT-associated genes, including vimentin (Fig. 3A and B), Twist
(Fig. 3C and D) and N-cadherin (Fig. 3E and F). BAPTA-AM increased basal and EGFinduced Snail mRNA levels (Fig. 3G and H), indicating that calcium signaling may
differentially regulate EMT-associated transcription factors in breast cancer cells.
Intracellular calcium chelation also blocked EGF-mediated increases in the CD44/CD24
ratio (Fig. 3I and J). These effects were evident after treatment with EGF for six or 24 hours.
In addition, pre-treatment with BAPTA-AM strongly inhibited the cellular transformation
from a grape-like to a spindle-like morphology with EGF-induced EMT (Fig. S2). However,
BAPTA-AM did not appear to prevent the initial loss of cell-cell adhesions associated with
EGF treatment (Fig. S2). Collectively these results demonstrate a critical role for Ca2+
signaling in EGF-induced EMT.

Author Manuscript

Intracellular calcium chelation inhibits hypoxia-mediated EMT
To assess whether calcium signaling was critically involved in other models of EMT
induction we assessed the effect of intracellular calcium chelation on hypoxia-mediated
EMT in breast cancer cells. Hypoxia-mediated increases in vimentin and N-cadherin mRNA
levels and the CD44/CD24 ratio were also inhibited by intracellular calcium chelation in this
model (Fig. 4A–C). Consistent with the EGF model, BAPTA-AM markedly increased Snail
mRNA levels in these cells (Fig. 4D). Unlike EGF-induced EMT, Twist mRNA levels were

not affected by intracellular calcium chelation (Fig. 4E). These findings indicate that several
elements of hypoxia-induced EMT are also blocked by intracellular calcium chelation.
STAT3 activation is calcium signal dependent
To define the molecular pathways involved in calcium-dependent modulation of EMT
induction we assessed several EGF-mediated signaling events (13) in the presence and
absence of [Ca2+]CYT chelation. No significant alteration in EGF-induced phosphorylation
of the EGFR (Tyr1173) was observed in cells pre-treated with BAPTA-AM (Fig. 5A–C). As
this early EGF signaling event was intact in cells with intracellular calcium chelation, the
inhibitory effects of BAPTA-AM must originate from calcium-dependent processes
downstream of the EGFR.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A significant increase in EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Thr202/Tyr204) was
apparent with intracellular calcium chelation (Fig. 5D–F). Basal intracellular free calcium
levels have previously been shown to regulate the extent and duration of EGF-induced
ERK1/2 phosphorylation (28), an effect that may be explained by calcium-dependent
regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (29). We then assessed the
calcium dependence of Akt and STAT3, two key signal transducers that are also activated
downstream of the EGFR. Calcium chelation failed to alter the degree of phosphorylation
(Ser473) of Akt as a consequence of EGF stimulation (Fig. 5G–I). However, STAT3
phosphorylation (Tyr705) by EGF was substantially inhibited with intracellular calcium
chelation (Fig. 5J–L). This effect was most pronounced at early (20 min) time points, where
more than 90% of STAT3 phosphorylation was inhibited. These findings indicate that, while
many elements of EGF signaling remain intact, chelation of intracellular calcium exquisitely
inhibits the ability of cancer cells to undergo EMT in response to EGF, in-part through
STAT3, which is a demonstrated driver of EMT in this (13) and other models (30).
siRNA mediated silencing of TRPM7 inhibits EGF-induced vimentin expression

Author Manuscript

To explore the identity of putative calcium channel(s) associated with EMT induction, we
screened a panel of calcium influx channels for their ability to regulate EGF-induced
vimentin expression. Channels assessed in this targeted immunofluorescence screen have
previously been shown to regulate migratory or growth-factor mediated processes in
epithelial cells (21, 31–34), and include the calcium release activated current (CRAC)
channel pore subunit ORAI1, the transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid type-3
(TRPV3), canonical types (TRPC) 4, 5, 6 and the melastatin-like (TRPM) 6 and 7 channels.
A significant decrease in EGF-induced vimentin induction was detected with TRPM7
siRNA in our immunofluorescence screen (Fig. 6A). This phenotype was confirmed with
immunoblot assays of EGF-mediated vimentin induction with TRPM7 knockdown using
two different types of siRNA (Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus and siGENOME, each
consisting of a different pool of four rationally designed siRNAs; Fig. 6B–F), and using the
TRPM7 channel inhibitor NS8593 (35) (Fig. 6G–H). However, TRPM7 silencing did not
affect vimentin mRNA levels (Fig. S3), showing that it acts predominately at the protein
level.

Given the effect of inhibiting TRPM7 expression (siRNA) or function (NS8593) on EGFinduced vimentin protein expression, we investigated whether TRPM7 channel expression
affects the global cytosolic calcium response to EGF. No significant differences in the
cytosolic calcium response to EGF stimulation were detected in MDA-MB-468 cells with
TRPM7 siRNA versus the non-targeting siRNA control (Fig. S4A–C), indicating that
modulation of vimentin protein induction by TRPM7 occurs independently of EGFmediated increases in global cytosolic calcium levels. In addition, we assessed whether EGF
directly activates TRPM7 channels (independently of the EGFR) using N1E-115 cells that
stably express plasmalemmal TRPM7 channels but do not express the EGFR (36). EGF
stimulation did not produce an increase in cytosolic calcium in these cells (Fig. S4D),
demonstrating that EGF does not directly bind to and activate TRPM7 channels, as may
occur with other ligand-gated TRP channels (e.g., TRPV1 (37)).

Author Manuscript

TRPM7 silencing attenuates EGF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation
To further delineate the role for TRPM7 in EGF-induced EMT we assessed the activation of
downstream signal transduction pathways in cells with TRPM7 silencing. Consistent with
the calcium chelation experiments, phosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 7A) and Akt (Fig.
7B) was not altered by TRPM7 silencing. However, in contrast to the induction seen with
calcium chelation, a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was observed in
breast cancer cells transfected with TRPM7 siRNA (Fig. 7C). This apparent reduction in
ERK1/2 activation may be attributed to an increase in total ERK1/2 abundance with
sustained TRPM7 silencing (Fig. 7C).

Author Manuscript

Due to the pronounced inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation observed with intracellular
calcium chelation (Fig. 5J–L), we next assessed the effect of TRPM7 silencing on EGFinduced STAT3 activation. Consistent with the calcium chelation experiments, a significant
reduction in EGF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was a consequence of TRPM7 silencing
in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (Fig. 7D). Thus, while TRPM7 regulates some
elements of EGF-induced EMT (i.e. vimentin protein induction and STAT3
phosphorylation), EGF-induced increases in the mRNA levels of other EMT markers (i.e.
Twist and N-cadherin) (Fig. S3), and EGF-induced changes in cell morphology (Fig. S5),
are not affected by modulation of TRPM7, suggesting that other transporters of calcium are
likely to be involved in the other aspects of calcium-dependent EMT induction demonstrated
by calcium chelation.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript

Calcium is important for many physiological and pathological processes ranging from
neurotransmission and cardiac contractility to cancer progression. There is now a general
appreciation of the complexity of the calcium signal and its reliance on temporal and spatial
characteristics as ways in which to define a cellular response (27). This work describes for
the first time a mechanism whereby induction of EMT in human breast cancer cells is
abrogated by intracellular calcium chelation.
Transient increases in [Ca2+]CYT have been characterized in normal human urothelial cells

(38). Our studies show that increases in [Ca2+]CYT are also observed in breast cancer cells
post-wounding. Mechanical wounding generated an intracellular calcium wave in MDAMB-468 breast cancer cells that was propagated by the release of a diffusible extracellular
calcium-mobilizing agent and via cell-cell communication. Conditioned media from
scratched monolayers increased EGF-induced vimentin expression in MDA-MB-468 cells.
Wound-like effects together with local elevations in EGF (or related ligands of the EGFR),
both of which may occur at the edge of primary tumors in vivo (26, 39), could act to enhance
the efficiency of EMT and tumor metastasis. The importance of local and coordinated
signaling events is evident in intestinal epithelial cells where TGFβ and EGF work
synergistically to induce an EMT-like phenotype (40).

Author Manuscript

EGF-induced EMT was calcium signal dependent, and the nature of the calcium signal was
of critical importance. In MDA-MB-468 cells, EGF produced an immediate increase in
[Ca2+]CYT and an increase in vimentin protein expression after 24 h. Stimulation with other
calcium mobilizing agents, including ATP and trypsin, failed to induce vimentin, despite
producing large increases in free cytosolic calcium levels. The absence of an EMT-like
phenotype with trypsin and ATP treatment indicates that calcium-dependent EMT may be
regulated in a manner that is dependent on the spatial and temporal aspects of the signal, as
distinct from magnitude-dependent increases in global [Ca2+]CYT.

Author Manuscript

A direct role for the calcium signal in EGF-induced EMT was demonstrated by the ability of
intracellular calcium chelation to block increases in vimentin protein expression and the
mRNA levels of several EMT-associated genes, including vimentin, Twist and N-cadherin.
In contrast to other EMT markers, a significant increase in Snail mRNA was observed with
intracellular calcium chelation. These findings suggest that the calcium signal differentially
regulates EMT-associated transcription factors. However, the overall inhibitory effect of
BAPTA-AM on EGF-induced EMT indicates that Snail is not a key transcription factor
involved in EGF-induced EMT in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, as suggested
previously (13). Induction of the EMT markers vimentin and N-cadherin, and changes in the
CD44/24 ratio, were also calcium-dependent in hypoxia-induced EMT, suggesting that the
calcium signal may be exploited in a variety of pathways that lead to EMT.

Author Manuscript

The identification of the calcium-permeable ion channel TRPM7 as a partial regulator of
EMT induction indicates that in addition to being involved in processes important for
steering the directional migration of cells (31), TRPM7 is also involved in the induction of a
more migratory and invasive phenotype through EMT. Recent work supporting this finding
describes an association between TRPM7 levels and metastasis formation in human breast
cancers (34). Given that TRPM7 silencing did not alter the global cytosolic calcium
response to EGF, further studies are required to determine whether the effect of TRPM7 on
EGF-induced vimentin protein expression and STAT3 phosphorylation is related to its
calcium-transporting ability (i.e. local calcium signaling), or whether this phenotype may be
attributed to a dysregulation of intracellular magnesium homeostasis or TRPM7 kinase
activity (41). Although our results indicate that EGF does not directly bind to and activate
TRPM7 channels, EGF may indirectly activate calcium influx through TRPM7 in MDAMB-468 breast cancer cells via an EGFR-phospholipase C (PLC) signaling pathway, as
previously shown for other PLC-coupled receptor agonists, including bradykinin and

thrombin (36). The inability of TRPM7 silencing to inhibit all of the aspects of EMT
inhibited by Ca2+ chelation (BAPTA-AM) strongly suggests that other transporters of
calcium are involved in specific aspects of calcium-dependent EMT induction.

Author Manuscript

The reduction in EGF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation by buffering of increases in
[Ca2+]CYT, or (in-part) by silencing of TRPM7, provides further evidence for the importance
of STAT3 in EMT-induction in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (13). Growth factor
mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in rat
cardiomyocytes is calcium-dependent (42). In addition, cell adhesion-mediated STAT3
activity in NIH3T3 cells is reduced by chelation of extracellular calcium (to disrupt cell
adhesions) (43). To our knowledge, this work is the first to report that EGF-mediated
STAT3 activity in breast cancer cells is highly regulated by intracellular free calcium levels,
and adds STAT3 to the list of known calcium-dependent transcription factors, which
includes nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and nuclear factor kappa B, both of
which are important in key aspects of cancer progression (44, 45).
In summary, we have identified a central role for the calcium signal in the induction of EMT
in human breast cancer cells by multiple stimuli, and have shown that the nature of this
calcium signal is of critical importance. Therefore, in addition to regulating processes
important for metastasis, such as cell migration, invasion and apoptotic resistance (19),
calcium signaling also regulates the ability of some stimuli to induce a more invasive
phenotype. We have also shown that EGF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation is highly
calcium-dependent and partially regulated by the calcium-permeable ion channel TRPM7.
The targeting of calcium-dependent pathways that regulate EMT induction may therefore
offer new therapeutic approaches for combating cancer metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture

Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-468 cells were maintained in a humidified incubator (37°C) in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 4 mM Lglutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin, as previously described (46).
MDA-MB-468 cells routinely tested negative for mycoplasma infection (MycoAlert; Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland) and STR profiling of the MDA-MB-468 cell line was performed by the
Queensland Institute of Medical Research, using the StemElite ID Profiling Kit (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). N1E-115/TRPM7 cells were cultured as described previously (47). To
induce EMT with EGF, MDA-MB-468 cells were serum starved (0.5% FCS, 24 h) and
treated with 50 ng/mL EGF (E9644; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (13), unless
otherwise specified. For hypoxia-induced EMT, cells were exposed to a hypoxic insult (1%
O2) for six hours. Cells were then returned to normal culture conditions for six hours and
RNA was isolated as described below (48, 49).
For studies assessing the ability of conditioned media to augment EGF-induced EMT,
MDA-MB-468 cells were serum starved for 24 h. A pipette tip was used to scratch cell
monolayers (50) and the media was aspirated. Cells were incubated with conditioned media
or control (media from unscratched wells) for 30 min prior to EMT induction with EGF. For

studies assessing the ability of calcium-mobilizing drugs to induce vimentin, cells were
serum starved and treated with EGF (50 ng/mL), trypsin (30 nM) or ATP (100 µM) for 24 h
prior to immunofluorescence. For experiments involving the chelation of intracellular
calcium, cells were loaded with 100 µM BAPTA-AM (B6769; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) or EGTA-AM (E1219) for 1 h at 37°C prior to stimulation with EGF (51).
Measurement of intracellular calcium

Author Manuscript

Measurement of intracellular calcium in MDA-MB-468 cells in response to EGF was
performed with a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPRTETRA; Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA) using the BD PBX no-wash Ca2+ Assay Kit (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) (52). Cells were loaded for 60 min at 37°C with 2 µM Fluo-4 AM
(Invitrogen) in a solution containing 5% (v/v) PBX Signal Enhancer and 500 µM probenecid
(Sigma Aldrich) in physiological salt solution (PSS; 10 mM HEPES, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.4 mM
MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM NaHCO3, 140 mM NaCl, 11.5 mM glucose, 1.8 mM
CaCl2) (22). Intracellular calcium measurements were performed with an excitation intensity
of 470–495 nm and a 515–575 nm emission filter. Fluorescent values were normalized to the
starting fluorescence and expressed as ‘relative [Ca2+]CYT’. Pseudo-ratiometric calcium
recordings in N1E-115/TRPM7 cells (36), were performed by loading cells plated on glass
coverslips with Oregon Green BAPTA-1 488 AM (10 µg/mL) and Fura-Red AM (30
µg/mL) in HEPES buffered saline (HBS; 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 140
mM NaCl, 10 mM glucose, 1.8 mM CaCl2). Measurements were performed on a BioRad
MRC600 confocal microscope, exciting at 488 nm and reading out Oregon Green (500–560
nm) and Fura-Red (580–650 nm) simultaneously. Data are presented as ‘ratio OG/FR’.

Author Manuscript

For imaging the calcium response to mechanical wounding, MDA-MB-468 cells were plated
in 96-well imaging plates and grown to confluency. Cells were loaded as previously
described, with Fluo-4 AM, PBX signal enhancer and probenecid in HEPES-buffered
DMEM. Confluent cell monolayers were wounded by scratching with a pipette tip (50).
Images were acquired with a 20× objective using a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 inverted
epifluorescence microscope (488 nm excitation and 550 nm emission). A 33 ms exposure
time was used. Pseudocolor images were generated in ImageJ (v1.45b, National Institutes of
Health (NIH)) with a 16-color LUT; brightness and contrast adjustment was uniformly
applied to all images.
Quantitative analysis of scratch-induced calcium waves

Author Manuscript

For cell image segmentation a candidate image was generated representing the average of all
movie frames subsequent to the scratch event (Fig. S1A). The outline of individual cells was
determined by applying a watershed transformation to the candidate image (Fig. S1B) using
the MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox (v7.11.0.584 (R2010b), The MathWorks, Natick,
MA, USA). Cell groups with an average normalized pixel intensity < 0.2 and cell groups
with an area ratio < 0.1 were excluded from the subsequent analysis.
The calcium transient for each cell was calculated as the average pixel intensity over all
pixels within a given cellular region (Fig. S1C). The resulting calcium transients I(T) were
fitted by a Boltzmann sigmoidal equation, which has the following functional form:

where I0 is the transient baseline, IA is the transient amplitude, k is the slope factor, T is time
and Th is the half-activation time (see also Fig. S1D). The parameters from Eqn. (1) were
fitted using the lsqnonlin function from the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox.
The time at which a cell group was activated, denoted by Tf, can be determined by
rearranging Eqn. (1) as follows:

where α is the proportion of the calcium transient above baseline (i.e. α = (I − I0)/IA). Cell
groups were considered active when α = 0.5, at which point Tf is given the equation 2.
The distance of the cell group relative to the location of the scratch was calculated as the
perpendicular distance from the cell group’s centroid to the line defining the scratch event.
To determine the relationship between Tf and D, the following equation was fit to the firing
time/distance tuples for each cell groups:

(100 µM, 1 h) or NS8593 (1 µM or 10 µM, 24 h). Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axio
Observer epifluorescence microscope, using a 20× objective. Regions were selected based
on Hoechst nuclear staining.
Immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

Immunofluorescence for vimentin was performed as previously described (46). Images were
acquired using a 10× objective on an ImageXpress® Micro automated epifluorescence
microscope (Molecular Devices) based on the following excitation and emission
wavelengths: 377–450 and 447-60 nm for DAPI and 531-40 and 593–640 nm for Cy3vimentin. Integrated intensity and percent positivity for vimentin were determined using
MetaXpress® (v3.1.0.83, Molecular Devices). For analysis of integrated intensity, datasets
were imported into AcuityXpress (v2.0, Molecular Devices) and image data were
normalized using linear (min-max) scaling as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoblotting
Cell extracts were generated using protein lysis buffer supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Gel electrophoresis

was performed using NuPAGE 4–12% gradient Bis-Tris gels with MOPS running buffer
(Invitrogen), and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked using 5%
non-fat milk powder in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h. The following antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA): anti-phospho-EGFR
(4407), anti-EGFR (2232), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (9106), anti-ERK1/2 (9102), antiphospho-Akt (4051), anti-Akt (9272), anti-phospho-STAT3 (9138), anti-STAT3 (9139). The
anti-vimentin antibody (V6389) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Primary antibodies
were diluted 1:1000, with the exception of anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:2000) and anti-vimentin
(1:750), and incubated at 4°C overnight. The following secondary antibodies were used:
anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary (170–6516) and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated
secondary (170–6515, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) at a 1:10,000 dilution. Images were
acquired using a VersaDoc Digital Imaging System (BioRad) and analysed using ImageJ
(NIH) as per the gel analysis method outlined in the ImageJ documentation. Protein density
was normalized to the β-actin loading control (1:10,000), with the exception of ERK1/2,
which has a similar molecular weight to β-actin, precluding its use. Phosphorylated proteins
were quantified relative to the respective total protein.

Real time RT-PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated and purified using Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kits (74134).
Omniscript RT Kits (205111, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were used for reverse transcription
of RNA, and resulting cDNA was amplified using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix
(4352042) and TaqMan Gene Expression Assays. Gene Expression Assays used in this
study include: vimentin (Hs00185584_m1), Twist (Hs00361186_m1), Snail
(Hs00195591_m1), N-cadherin (Hs00983062_m1), CD24 (Hs02379687_s1), CD44
(Hs01075861_m1), and TRPM7 (Hs00292383_m1). Reactions were cycled using a
StepOnePlus Real Time RT-PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
with universal cycling conditions. Relative quantitation was determined with reference to
18S ribosomal RNA and was analysed using the comparative CT method (53).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (v5.04 for Windows; GraphPad
Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical tests used are provided in the figure legends.

NS8593 for 24 h prior to EGF treatment and NS8593 was maintained during EGF treatment.
Statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple
comparisons post-tests. * P < 0.05.

Figure 7. TRPM7 silencing alters specific EGF signaling pathways

Author Manuscript

Phosphorylation of A) EGFR (Tyr1173), B) Akt (Ser473), C) ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204),
and D) STAT3 (Tyr705) following EGF stimulation (50 ng/mL, 20 min) in MDA-MB-468
breast cancer cells transfected with nontargeting (NT) siRNA or TRPM7 OTP siRNA.
Graphs show mean ± S.D. for three independent experiments. The effect of TRPM7 gene
silencing on protein phosphorylation was assessed using two-way ANOVA with
Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons post-tests. * P < 0.05.
