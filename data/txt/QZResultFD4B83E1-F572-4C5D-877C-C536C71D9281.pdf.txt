Abstract
The quality of cancer genomic and proteomic data relies upon the quality of the clinical specimens examined.
Here, we show that data derived from non-microdissected glioblastoma multiforme tumor tissue is either masked
or not accurate, producing correlations between genomic and proteomic data that lead to false classiﬁcations for
therapeutic stratiﬁcation. We analyzed the level of 133 key signaling proteins and phosphoproteins in laser
capture microdissected (LCM) primary tumors from a study set of tissues used for the Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) proﬁling efforts, comparing the results to tissue-matched, nontumor cell–enriched lysates from adjacent
sections. Among the analytes, 44%, including targets for clinically important inhibitors, such as phosphorylated
mTOR, AKT, STAT1, VEGFR2, or BCL2, differed between matched tumor cell–enriched and nonenriched
specimens (even in tumor sections with 90% tumor cell content). While total EGFR protein levels were higher
in tumors with EGFR mutations, regardless of tumor cell enrichment, EGFR phosphorylation was increased only
in LCM-enriched tumor specimens carrying EGFR mutations. Phosphorylated and total PTEN, which is highly
expressed in normal brain, was reduced only in LCM-enriched tumor specimens with either PTEN mutation or
loss in PTEN copy number, with no differences observed in non-microdissected samples. These results were
conﬁrmed in an independent, non-microdissected, publicly available protein data set from the TCGA database.
Our ﬁndings highlight the necessity for careful upfront cellular enrichment in biospecimens that form the basis for
targeted therapy selection and for molecular characterization efforts such as TCGA. Cancer Res; 74(3); 818–28.

Introduction
Tumor cells do not exist as a separate cellular entity but are
part of a heterogeneous microecology that includes many
different cell types such as ﬁbroblasts, endothelial, nerve, and
inﬁltrating cells of the immune system among others. It is
becoming clear that this tumor microenvironment is an active
participant in tumorigenesis (1, 2). Depending on the tumor
type, location, and origin, the cellular makeup of the tumor
tissue varies dramatically. Even within the brain, which is
typically associated with few specialized cell types, high-grade
glioma tissue contains transformed cancer cells, microglia,
inﬁltrating lymphocytes, neural precursor cells, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes (3). Understanding the
contribution of each compartment or cell type to the disease is

critical. In fact, if targeted therapy is to be successful, we need
to understand what to target and where.
Coupling techniques that preselect speciﬁc tissue areas
and/or cell types with downstream molecular proﬁling analysis
may provide a powerful approach to personalized therapy. One
such technique, laser capture microdissection (LCM), provides
microscopically guided selective capture of individual cells or
tissue areas (4) and has received widespread acceptance and
has been used successfully in numerous studies (5–7).
A large proportion of targeted therapeutics in oncology are
kinase inhibitors (8), reﬂecting our current understanding of
cancer as being most often a disease of signaling derangements. As kinases are the central feature of protein signaling
pathways that depend on the posttranslational phosphorylation of proteins, accurate measurements of the functional
signaling architecture in human diagnostic tissue is necessary
to facilitate targeted treatment decisions. Past studies have
revealed that protein pathway activation levels cannot be
obtained by measuring genomic alterations or RNA transcript
proﬁling alone, which have little correlative relationships with
posttranslational protein modiﬁcations. One proteomic technique that is sensitive enough to enable measurement of the
functional state of cell signaling pathways in LCM material is
the reverse-phase protein microarray (RPMA) technology (9).
RPMA allows the evaluation of several hundred samples on a

single "dot blot" type array, can measure hundreds of phosphoproteins from only a few thousand cells, and has been
widely adopted in research and clinical trial settings (for
review, see ref. 10).
Past work has evaluated the impact of upfront cellular
enrichment by LCM (11, 12). However, the overall impact of
upfront cellular enrichment on drug target activation signatures and multi-omic data analysis with correlation between
protein activation and gene mutation/copy number variation
has not been systematically studied. Here, we have investigated
the impact of tumor cell enrichment by LCM on signal protein
pathway activation data of primary human glioblastoma multiforme tumor samples that represent a subset of glioblastoma
multiforme tumors from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
project. The TCGA project is systematically charting genomic
changes in 20 different cancers with hope of determining
driving mutations in tumor cells and stimulating the discovery
of new drugs as well as enable targeted therapy utilizing
currently available drugs (13, 14). Using available genomic
TCGA data, we investigated whether upfront cellular enrichment via LCM produced proteomic data that better correlates
with known genomic mutations and copy number variations in
key cancer drivers such as EGFR and PTEN. Moreover, we have
used this tissue set to determine whether very high endogenous
tumor cell content (90%) diminishes the potential difference
between enriched and nonenriched samples and would thus
allow for omitting sample preprocessing, as is current TCGA
practice. We then determined the impact of LCM on patient
stratiﬁcation for potential targeted therapy by interrogating
differences in actionable/druggable signaling protein measurements in matched LCM versus non-LCM material.

Materials and Methods
Tissue procurement
Resected brain tumors were collected at Henry Ford Hospital (Detroit, MI) with written consent from patients in
accordance with institutional guidelines and graded pathologically as glioblastoma multiforme according to the WHO
criteria. Tumor samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
within 1 hour of surgery. Frozen tissue from 39 newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme previously proﬁled by the
TCGA (15) were used for this work; in most cases, tumor
samples were cut from tissue adjacent to those sent to TCGA.
Somatic mutations and copy number variation were obtained
from cBio Cancer Genomics Portal (Supplementary Table S1;
ref. 16).
Laser capture microdissection
Frozen tissue was cut into 8 mm sections with alternating
sections of each sample being subjected to LCM or whole slide
lysis (Fig. 1). LCM was conducted as previously described (17).
Care was taken to selectively microdissect viable tumor cells
without inclusion of necrotic tissue, blood vessels, body ﬂuids,
and normal brain parenchyma. Tumor cell selection was
conducted during LCM by histologic analysis of the tissue
specimen, under guidance of a board-certiﬁed pathologist,
using standard surgical pathology criteria for frozen glioblastoma multiforme sections: nuclear anaplasia, mitotic activity,

nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, cellular density, microvascular
hyperplasia, and necrosis (18). To collect whole slide lysates,
tissue sections were lysed directly in extraction buffer, boiled
for 8 minutes at 100 C, and frozen at 80 C until printing.
Sections per sample were alternated between LCM and slide
lysis, and the number of sections used for slide lysis was
dependent on the number of sections used for LCM.
RPMA construction and staining
LCM tumor cell lysates were prepared and RPMA were
printed and stained as previously described (10). Samples were
printed along with a series of positive and negative control
lysates consisting of cell lines treated with compounds that
cause broad phosphoprotein increases (e.g., pervanadate, calyculin) and slides were stored dessicated at 20 C before
staining. All antibodies used (Supplementary Table S2) were
subjected to extensive validation for single band, appropriate
molecular weight speciﬁcity by Western blotting as well as
phosphorylation speciﬁcity through the use of cell lysate
controls (e.g., HeLa  pervanadate, Jurkat  calyculin). Raw
spot analysis data were acquired using ImageQuant 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics) and postprocessed using the Reverse-Phase
Protein Microarray Analysis Suite (developed in-house; ref. 19).
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
were baked at 56 C for 30 minutes, deparafﬁnized in xylene,
and rehydrated in a series of graded alcohols (100%, 95%, and
70%) with a ﬁnal rinse in wash buffer (Dako). Immunostaining

sample. Quartile differences between LCM and slide lysis
samples were calculated by scoring each phosphoprotein
level or pathway activation score according to quartiles
(0, 1þ, 2þ, 3þ) and comparing this quartile score between
matched LCM and slide lysis samples.

Statistical analysis
Two-way unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis
was prepared using JMP (version 5.1, SAS). Protein endpoints were only included in hierarchical clustering if all
data points were available. High and low signaling clusters
were determined according to the dendrogram. Mean comparisons of protein levels and phosphorylation were conducted in R (20) using Wilcoxon rank-sum or Student t test,
depending on data normality (Shapiro–Wilk test). Data
correlation (R2) was determined using GraphPad Prism
(version 5.04; GraphPad Software Inc.), which was also used
to prepare all of the bar graphs, box plots, and scatter plots.
Differences between populations of PTEN copy number
(0, 1, 2) were determined in R using pairwise Wilcoxon
rank-sum with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison. The Spearman r analysis was conducted using SciPy
(21). P < 0.05 was chosen to indicate signiﬁcance and P < 0.1
to indicate a trend. The EGFR/AKT/mTOR pathway activation score was determined by adding the respective rank of
EGFR Tyr1068, AKT Ser473, and mTOR Ser2448 for each

Many protein endpoints differ signiﬁcantly between
enriched and nonenriched samples
As a measure of quantifying the difference between tumor
cell enrichment via LCM versus no enrichment (slide lysis), we
measured the mean total or phosphorylation level for 133
proteins. Of these, 44% showed a signiﬁcant difference by
mean comparison (P < 0.05) between LCM and slide lysis
samples (Fig. 2A). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that samples clustered largely by LCM or slide
lysis as opposed to which tumor the matched pairs originated
from, with only 1 of 39 patient-matched pairs clustering
together (TCGA-06-0162, Supplementary Fig. S1). Limiting the
samples to those containing 90% tumor reduced the difference between LCM and slide lysis to 14% of the analytes
measured, whereas 23% of the measured signaling proteins
were signiﬁcantly different between LCM and slide lysis samples containing 50% to 89% tumor. Because of the low number
of samples (n ¼ 5), the difference between LCM and slide lysis
was not determined for samples containing less than 50%
tumor.

LCM Is Critical for Proteomic Analysis in Glioblastoma Multiforme

Next, we investigated individual LCM/slide lysis pairs to
determine whether a general trend (e.g., a scalar increase or
decrease from LCM to slide lysis) exists that would allow
computational transformation of slide lysis data to LCM.
However, as shown for 3 example phosphoproteins relevant
for glioblastoma multiforme tumor biology (mTOR Ser2448,
BCL2 Ser70, VEGFR2 Tyr951), phosphorylation levels did not
generally increase or decrease from LCM to slide lysis but were
protein- and patient-dependent (Fig. 2B). We also failed to ﬁnd
a correlation between protein phosphorylation levels in LCM/
slide lysis matched pairs when focusing only on high tumor
content samples (Fig. 2B). In fact, for VEGFR2 Tyr951, we even
found a slight but signiﬁcant inverse correlation, showing
reduced levels of VEGFR2 Tyr951 phosphorylation in slide
lysis samples with high phosphorylation levels in matched
LCM pairs.

whether co-clustering of matched LCM and slide lysis samples differed between ErbB/HER proteins, which are known
to be mostly expressed and activated in tumor cells (22), and
their downstream signaling targets, which are more likely to
be activated in non-tumor cells as well. Furthermore, we
focused on the lowest and highest signaling clusters each
because of their potential impact on patient stratiﬁcation
and selection for therapy. We found much more prominent
co-clustering of matched dissected and undissected samples
for ErbB/HER kinases compared with downstream targets
(81% and 50% LCM/slide lysis co-clustering for ErbB/HER
kinases in low and high signaling sample groups compared
with 44% and 12% LCM/slide lysis co-clustering for downstream targets; Fig. 3). This indicates that the impact of LCM
depends, in part, on how exclusively a protein is expressed or
activated in tumor cells.

The impact of enrichment is protein-dependent
Using Spearman r analysis on all 133 protein endpoints,
we identiﬁed the ErbB/HER family receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTK) as constituting a signiﬁcant portion of the small
subset of proteins with high correlation between LCM and
receptor tyrosine kinase samples (Supplementary Table S3).
On the basis of these results, we then wanted to determine

Whole-tissue extraction masks tumor biology and

We then chose to investigate the EGF receptor (EGFR) and
the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which are clinically important proteins in glioblastoma multiforme tumor
biology within the ErbB/HER signaling pathway and are known

to be highly correlated with their cognate genomic mutational
state (23, 24). Because of the more speciﬁc expression of EGFR
in tumor cells compared with normal brain cells (22), we
postulated a limited effect of tumor cell enrichment via LCM
on the correlation of EGFR DNA mutation/copy number
variation and EGFR (phospho)protein levels. In contrast, PTEN
protein/phosphorylation level concordance with DNA mutation/copy number variation should be affected much more by
LCM, because of its more ubiquitous expression in all cell types
(Fig. 5D; ref. 25).
Of 30 patients with known EGFR mutation status, 5
patients (17%) had a mutation in EGFR (Supplementary

signiﬁcantly increased EGFR protein levels, both in LCM and

phosphorylation (Tyr1173) were only found to be signiﬁcant
or showed a trend toward signiﬁcance (Tyr1068) after LCM
while being masked by high variation after lysing whole

We then investigated whether EGFR gene ampliﬁcation
would show the same trend. Of 36 patients with known EGFR

ampliﬁcation (Fig. 4B). Although the increase in total EGFR
and both phosphorylated forms of EGFR was signiﬁcant (P <
0.05) in LCM samples, the increase in EGFR Tyr1173 phosphorylation was less pronounced and not signiﬁcant in
whole-tissue lysates. No signiﬁcant impact of tumor content
was found for either LCM or slide lysis samples (Fig. 4B).
Following this, we determined the impact of PTEN mutation on PTEN protein levels. Of the 39 TCGA samples used
for this study, 30 had a known PTEN mutation status, with 23
patients displaying PTEN and 7 patients PTEN mutation
(23%; Supplementary Table S1). A decrease in PTEN protein
levels was found in tissue samples from patients with PTEN
mutation only when the data were derived from cells
enrichment by LCM (P < 0.1; Fig. 5A). Moreover, constraining
the analysis to high tumor content (90%) samples did not
improve the ability to obtain accurate PTEN protein data in
whole-tissue lysates (Fig. 5A). PTEN gene copy number was
available for 36 samples, with 7 patients having no change
in copy number (19%), 25 patients with single-copy loss
(heterozygous deletion, 69%) and 4 patients with deep loss

(possibly homozygous deletion, 11%). Deep loss of PTEN
resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in PTEN protein levels and
phosphorylation (Ser380) again identiﬁed only after LCM
tumor cell enrichment (Fig. 5B).
Whole-tissue extraction masks expected DNA mutation/
protein network activation determinants
Given the current emphasis on signaling networks in cancer
biology, we sought to determine the effect of LCM on accurate
determination of EGFR and PTEN mutation–driven phosphorylation of AKT (for review including current molecular targets
of this signaling network in glioblastoma multiforme, see
ref. 26). We found a highly signiﬁcant inverse correlation
between PTEN levels and AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 6A; AKT
Ser473: R2 ¼ 0.8, P < 0.01; AKT Thr3081: R2 ¼ 0.9, P < 0.005) in

correlation was lost when analyzing nonenriched samples
(AKT Ser473: R2 ¼ 0.1, P > 0.5; AKT Thr3081: R2 ¼ 0.1, P >
0.6). As expected, no correlation was found between AKT
phosphorylation and PTEN in patients without PTEN

samples (Fig. 6B; EGFR Tyr1068: R2 ¼ 0.8, P < 0.05; EGFR

displayed EGFR mutations (24%), whereas 37 displayed PTEN
mutations (30%). Gene copy number information was available
for 159 samples, with 76 (48%) having no or limited EGFR
ampliﬁcation (0/þ1) and 83 (52%) having signiﬁcant EGFR
ampliﬁcation (þ2), whereas 16 patients had no change in PTEN
copy number (16%), 124 patients had a single-copy loss (78%)
and 18 patients a deep loss (11%). As shown using this
independent data (Fig. 4C), and in keeping with our own data,
EGFR protein and phosphorylation levels were also signiﬁcantly increased in patients carrying EGFR mutations or
signiﬁcant EGFR gene copy number increases (Fig. 4C). However, as we also found in our undissected set, the TCGA data
showed lack of the expected correlation between PTEN mutational status or PTEN copy number with PTEN protein levels
(Fig. 5C).

LCM Is Critical for Proteomic Analysis in Glioblastoma Multiforme

Phosphoprotein measurements obtained from
undissected tissue samples lead to large variance and
inaccurate drug target activation conclusions
To evaluate the impact of LCM enrichment of tumor cells
for potential downstream clinical applications, we chose 6
proteins that are both relevant for glioblastoma multiforme
biology and known important drug targets for which the
measurement could be envisioned for patient selection/stratiﬁcation: EGFR, AKT, MTOR, STAT1, VEGFR2, and BCL2. Next,
we scored tumors depending on the respective phosphorylation level of each protein by converting the continuous variable
RPMA data into quartiles of relative phosphorylation (0, 1þ,
2þ, 3þ) similar to IHC scoring. We also calculated an EGFR/
AKT/mTOR pathway activation score for each sample, including EGFR Tyr1068, AKT Ser473, and mTOR Ser2448 measurements as previously described (27) to evaluate the impact of
LCM enrichment within the context of a canonical signaling
network measurement. Following this, we compared how
patients would have been stratiﬁed for therapy based on drug
target activation measurements using these scoring determinants. We found that even for samples with at least 90% tumor
cell content, 28% of matched LCM and slide lysis samples
showed signiﬁcant pathway activation classiﬁcation differences of 2 or more quartiles (e.g., 0 to 3þ or 0 to 2þ and vice
versa; Fig. 7A). In addition, 3 individual proteins (STAT1
Tyr701, VEGFR2 Tyr951, and BCL2 Ser70) showed signiﬁcant
classiﬁcation differences between matched LCM and slide lysis
samples in at least 40% of patients (Fig. 7B). Samples with

smaller amounts of endogenous tumor cell content had only a
modest reduction in major drug target classiﬁcation changes
between undissected and LCM material.

Discussion
The clinical utility of molecular proﬁling for personalized
therapy is inherently tied to the accuracy and ﬁdelity of the
underpinning data used. Recent high-proﬁle molecular characterization efforts such as the TCGA have sought to develop
translational "-omic" databases wherein comprehensive
molecular analysis of DNA, RNA, metabolomic, and (phospho)protein levels are being used to develop a systems level
view of tumor biology with the ultimate hope of using such data
for personalized therapy-based applications. Use of upfront
cellular enrichment technologies such as LCM have been
extensively used in conjunction with molecular proﬁling and
recent studies have revealed both the clinical accuracy of data
obtained by LCM-based protein analysis (12, 28) and the
impact of coincident stromal and epithelial co-contamination
on molecular data (11, 29). However, none of these past efforts
have systematically investigated the impact of LCM from
clinical specimens on downstream data ﬁdelity in the context
of important drug target measurements and DNA mutation–
protein phosphorylation analysis. The results presented herein
provide evidence in support of the critical role of upfront tumor
cell enrichment, especially in clinical patient samples that form
the basis for targeted therapy selection and for important
molecular characterization initiatives like the TCGA.

One may expect a limited impact of tumor cell enrichment
for glioblastoma multiforme, where tumor cells are often
assumed to be mixed with fewer cells of the microenvironment,
owing to its high tumor cell density compared with normal
brain parenchyma. In contrast to this assumption, we found
more than 40% of the 133 proteins/phosphoproteins and
nearly all important protein drug targets for clinical therapeutics that were measured to be signiﬁcantly different between
enriched and nonenriched samples (Fig. 2A). In fact, underpinned by the systemic differences in protein level and activation, only 1 of 39 enriched/nonenriched sample pairs coming
from the same patient clustered together during unsupervised
hierarchical clustering (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We hypothesized that the highest impact of LCM would be
on the measurement of DNA mutation–protein level linkages
of analytes with expression within both the tumor cells and the
surrounding brain parenchyma, whereas measurements of
proteins highly expressed in tumor cells would be less affected
(Supplementary Fig. S2). This was supported by our observation that ErbB/HER RTKs, which are well known to be
highly expressed/phosphorylated in tumor cells, make up a
signiﬁcant portion of the small subset of proteins with high
correlation between LCM and slide lysis samples (Fig. 3;
Supplementary Table S3). In addition, increased EGFR protein/phosphoprotein levels were observed for both LCM and
slide lysis samples from patients with increased EGFR gene
copy number. However, the increase in EGFR phosphorylation
in carriers of EGFR mutations was not statistically signiﬁcant
in slide lysis samples due to high data variability (Fig. 4B). Only
in an independent study set that consisted of a larger number
of nonenriched samples (n ¼ 159, publicly available TCGA
data) was statistical signiﬁcance reached. This indicates that
for largely tumor cell–speciﬁc proteins, the analysis of large
numbers of samples may overcome the observed increased
patient-to-patient variation following whole-tissue lysis. In
contrast to EGFR, PTEN is highly expressed in normal brain
(25, 30). In fact, loss of PTEN copy number is frequently found in
glioblastoma multiforme (15) and is under intense investigation as a companion diagnostic marker for PI3K/AKT/mTOR
targeting therapies. Moreover, it has been recently shown by us
that PTEN mutation status can be accurately determined by
RPMA-based PTEN protein levels in lymphoblastic leukemia
samples (31), providing conﬁdence in the PTEN results we
obtained herein. We observed decreased PTEN levels in tumors
from patients with deep loss of PTEN or carriers of PTEN
mutations only after LCM (Fig. 5). Furthermore, and in contrast
to EGFR, increasing the number of nonenriched samples by
investigating the aforementioned large independent study set
of publicly available TCGA data did not improve the ability to
measure correlations between PTEN protein levels and PTEN
mutation or variations in PTEN copy number (Fig. 5C). This
indicates that for proteins/phosphoproteins that are ubiquitously expressed/activated both in tumor and non-tumor cells,
the non-tumor cell signal also scales up with sample size
(Supplementary Fig. S2) and that for many important phosphoproteins such as AKT, mTOR, ERK, etc., simply analyzing a
larger number of nonenriched samples will not produce more
accurate data or correlations. Compounding this issue is that

826

Cancer Res; 74(3) February 1, 2014

for every given tissue sample, it will be impossible to know
ahead of time the percent contribution and amount of each cell
type. Thus, although the overall amount of signiﬁcantly different analytes between LCM and slide lysis samples is reduced
with higher tumor content [23% (50%–89% tumor) to 14% (90%
tumor); Fig. 2A], several key signaling proteins do not beneﬁt
signiﬁcantly from increased tumor cellularity (Fig. 7B).
Activated EGFR is known to lead to the downstream activation of AKT, whereas active PTEN causes a downstream
reduction in AKT phosphorylation. However, AKT is a very
"promiscuous" signaling molecule that interacts with and is
activated by a plethora of upstream ligands and pathways. It is
therefore not surprising that we only found a correlation
between AKT phosphorylation and EGFR or PTEN when either
was mutated and therefore constituted a major driving signaling inﬂuence (or lack of, as in the case of PTEN). However,
the expected and observed correlation between (phospho-)
EGFR levels, PTEN levels, and AKT phosphorylation disappeared in all cases if samples were not subjected to LCM-based
tumor cell enrichment. Taken together, these observations
indicate that expected network biology within tumor cells is
more clearly revealed by upfront tumor cell enrichment.
On the basis of the observed differences between LCM and
slide lysis samples, one may raise the possibility that the
procedure of LCM itself might systemically change the proteome. However, the utility and validity of LCM have been shown
in a multitude of publications by many research groups (4),
including direct proteomic comparisons of LCM versus nonLCM matched tumor samples, which showed no alteration of
the proteome by LCM (32). Moreover, recent publications have
shown excellent and even better concordance of (phospho-)
HER2 protein data obtained from microdissected tissue with
matched immunohistochemical and FISH data (28). In our
study, we found better linkage between proteomic and genomic data in LCM samples compared with matched undissected
samples, indicating that LCM facilitates a correct snapshot of
the tumor cell–speciﬁc proteome.
Apart from improving our understanding of tumor biology,
measuring the activation of signaling proteins also provides a
means of patient stratiﬁcation for targeted therapy. Given their
central role in tumorigenesis and metastatic progression,
protein kinases are ideal targets for therapy, which is reﬂected
in the high proportion of protein kinase inhibitors in the
current drug pipeline for cancer therapy (8). On the basis of
our analysis of important drug targets such as phosphorylated
EGFR, STAT1, VEGFR2, BCL2, AKT, and mTOR, as well as
EGFR/AKT/mTOR pathway activation, a signiﬁcant number of
tumors would have been inaccurately determined to have little
to no drug target either at the individual or at the pathway level
when actually they are highly activated, or vice versa, when
using slide lysis samples (Fig. 7) even when limiting the analysis
to samples with 90% tumor content or more. This raises
concern that treatment selection based on data obtained from
tumor specimens that were not microdissected (and independent of starting tumor cellularity) may generate incorrect
decisions if the targeted therapy is directed toward tumor cells.
In an effort to ensure the appropriate quality and ﬁdelity of
data, restrictions such as minimum tumor content per sample

LCM Is Critical for Proteomic Analysis in Glioblastoma Multiforme

are typically used as ﬁlters for biospecimen inclusion/exclusion. In a TCGA pilot set studying glioblastoma multiforme, the
inclusion criteria were set at 80% tumor nuclei, which has lead
to the exclusion of 65% glioblastoma multiforme biospecimens
(15). Recently, TCGA has determined that current secondgeneration sequencing platforms are sensitive enough "that
60 percent [tumor nuclei] provides a sufﬁcient proportion to
generate high quality data in which the tumor's signal can be
distinguished from other cells' signals," which allows for a
larger number of biospecimens to be included in the study (33).
However, our data suggest that for the analysis of proteins/
phosphoproteins, the practice of sample inclusion/exclusion
based on tumor cell content does not lead to appropriate
quality data, even if standards are set as high as 90% tumor
nuclei. Only upfront tumor cell enrichment appears to selectively provide tumor cell–speciﬁc proteomic data.
A potential issue that could contribute some variability to
the levels of proteins/phosphoproteins measured in our study
was the impact of phosphoprotein changes that could occur
between the start of surgery and the time when samples were
snap-frozen. It is well-known that kinases and phosphatases
are active during warm and cold ischemia time (34), which may
affect the ﬁnal protein/phosphoprotein measurements.
Although it is impossible to know exactly what the impact of
preanalytical variables was on the analytes we measured, the
ﬁdelity of the data (following LCM) for phosphorylated EGFR,
PTEN, and AKT based on concordance with PTEN and EGFR
mutation data was shown. Protein/phosphoprotein–DNA status correlations were conducted under the assumption that
the tumor cells provided the major source of altered genetic
information. Currently, efforts like the TCGA use the whole
tissue sample itself as input for genetic and proteomic analysis.
Although nearly all current genomic analyses are focused on
the identiﬁcation of driver DNA alterations within the tumor
cell archive, efforts to understand changes in the genetic
landscape of stromal cells, immune cells, etc., within the
context of the tumor microenvironment are now beginning.

As these studies unfold, the impact of tumor cell enrichment
within the context of protein/phosphoprotein–DNA status
correlations therein will need to be carefully scrutinized. It
also remains to be seen what the impact on data accuracy
obtained from global proteomic analysis (e.g., from mass
spectrometry–based proﬁling) will be when tumor cell enrichment is not used. However, on the basis of the data provided
herein and the signiﬁcant degree of discrepancies and inaccuracies that our data revealed even in our subscribe analysis
on a limited number of proteins and DNA mutations, further
evaluation of the impact of upfront tissue enrichment techniques on such analysis is imperative and warranted.
