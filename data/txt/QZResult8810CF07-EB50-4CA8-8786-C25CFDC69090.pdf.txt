BACKGROUND. Improving results in nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will
require the development of new drugs and strategies to combine available agents.
On the basis of data indicating the activity of docetaxel as second-line therapy, a
Phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the sequential combination of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin (P) and gemcitabine (G)
followed by docetaxel (DOC) in patients with advanced NSCLC.

METHODS. Patients with 1997 TNM stage IIIB (pleural effusion)/stage IV NSCLC,
performance status (PS) of 0–1, and normal organ function were eligible. Therapy
consisted of P at 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 and G 1200 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 every
3 weeks for 3 cycles followed, in nonprogressive patients, by DOC 30 mg/m2

rate was 36.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23–49). The median overall survival
was 11 months (95% CI: 9–13); the median progression-free survival was 6
months (95% CI: 5–7); and the 1- and 2-year survivals were 48% and 25%, respectively. One- and 2-year progression-free survivals were 12% and 8%, respectively.
Both phases of the treatment protocol were well tolerated.

CONCLUSIONS. P/G followed by weekly DOC is well tolerated and active as firstline therapy for NSCLC patients and provides a feasible chemotherapeutic option

ung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and approximately 80% of all cases are categorized as
nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).1 Chemotherapy with platinumbased doublets is the mainstay in the management of advanced
NSCLC and has been shown to provide a modest but significant survival benefit with an improvement in quality of life, as compared
with best supportive care.2 In this context, cisplatin-based regimens
appear to be more active than carboplatin-based ones, as demonstrated by a recently conducted individual patient meta-analysis of
randomized trials.3 Unfortunately, cisplatin-based regimens have
the disadvantage of cumulative toxicity requiring reduction in individual drug dosages and limiting the number of cycles that may be
delivered. To avoid increased toxicity with continued treatment,
therapeutic strategies using a limited number of chemotherapy
cycles have been devised. Two randomized studies have indeed compared fixed numbers of chemotherapy cycles (3 cycles of the mitomycin C plus vindesine plus cisplatin [MVP] regimen and 4 cycles

of carboplatin/paclitaxel) vs continued treatment (up
to 6 cycles with MVP and until progression with carboplatin/paclitaxel): although no statistically significant difference in terms of response and survival was
found in either study, a trend toward better efficacy
for continued treatment was observed in both studies,
despite increased cumulative toxicity, such as peripheral neurotoxicity, fatigue, and anemia. In addition,
both studies were underpowered to truly demonstrate the noninferiority of the strategy using a limited number of treatment cycles.4,5 An alternative
strategy to reduce cumulative toxic effects while preserving activity could be the administration of a limited number platinum-based chemotherapy cycles
followed by maintenance/sequential therapy with
nonplatinum agents. This strategy was recently explored by Novello et al6 in a Phase III study in which
patients received 2 cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine and were subsequently randomized between
3 additional cycles of the same combination or gemcitabine alone. Although preliminary, the results of
that study suggest that maintenance with single-agent
gemcitabine is equally effective, as compared with
continuing cisplatin, and has a significantly more
favorable toxicity profile in terms of both hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity.6 Along these lines,
promising results were recently presented by Belani
et al7,8 suggesting that weekly paclitaxel maintenance
after 6 cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel may indeed
prolong survival with minimal additional toxicity.
Similar results were obtained by Brodowicz et al9
with gemcitabine maintenance therapy after initial
therapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin. Maintenance
chemotherapy was feasible and produced significantly longer time to progression compared with best
supportive care alone. Whereas the former study
suggests that altering the schedule of paclitaxel in
the maintenance phase may somehow overcome or
delay the emergence of resistance, an alternative
strategy could be to sequentially administer noncross-resistant drugs after a limited number of a
platinum-based doublet, thereby increasing drug
diversity, and possibly antitumor activity, while
decreasing platinum-related cumulative toxicity. In
this context in vitro biological evidence and recent
clinical data demonstrate that taxanes have activity
in patients with platinum-resistant NSCLC and improve survival as compared with supportive care or
other chemotherapy regimens when given as secondline therapy.10–15
Based on these data, we conducted a Phase II
study to evaluate the tolerability and activity of a
sequential strategy using weekly docetaxel (DOC)
given after 3 cycles of cisplatin (P) and gemcitabine

(G) as first-line treatment in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic NSCLC. The choice
of a weekly schedule of DOC was based on a metaanalysis recently conducted by our group demonstrating that weekly administration schedules significantly
improve the tolerability while preserving the activity
of DOC when given as second-line therapy.16

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion Criteria
Eligibility criteria included histologically or cytologically documented advanced NSCLC (1997 TNM stage
IIIB or stage IV disease), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0–1, and
adequate hematologic (absolute neutrophil count
1.5 3 109/L, platelet count 100 3 109/L, hemoglobin 10 g/dL), hepatic (serum bilirubin and transaminases less than twice the upper limit of normal),
and renal (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or a calculated creatinine clearance 60 mL/min) function.
Asymptomatic brain metastases not requiring immediate radiation therapy or adequately treated brain
metastases were allowed. Other eligibility criteria
were the presence of at least 1 unirradiated and bidimensionally measurable lesion. Previous surgery and
radiation therapy were acceptable. No prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy were allowed. All patients
gave written informed consent before study entry.
The study was approved by the local ethics committees and was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki
and the guidelines on good clinical practice.
Pretreatment Evaluation and Treatment
At baseline all patients had a complete history and
physical examination, complete blood work-up, electrocardiogram, and a computer tomography scan of
the chest, brain, upper abdomen, and any other sites
of known disease. Other scans were performed if
clinically indicated. Treatment consisted of 3 cycles
of P and G every 21 days. P was administered intravenously at 75 mg/m2 on Day 1, with appropriate hydration and antiemetics; G was administered on Days 1
and 8 at 1200 mg/m2. After restaging, nonprogressive
patients received single-agent DOC at a dose of 30
mg/m2 every week for 6 consecutive weeks every 8
weeks. Two cycles of docetaxel were planned. Dose
modifications for the cytotoxic agents were performed during the course of treatment for significant
hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. Briefly, an
absolute neutrophil count greater than 1.5 3 109/L
and platelet count greater than 100 3 109/L were
required before each cycle of therapy. After grade 4

neutropenia lasting more than 7 days or grade 4 febrile neutropenia or grade 4 thrombocytopenia,
patients were retreated with a dose reduction of 25%
after recovery. Toxicities were graded according to
the World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity criteria. Therapy was discontinued and the patient removed from protocol in the presence of progressive
disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity as assessed by
the investigator, or upon patient request.

Statistical Methods
The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate
the activity in terms of objective response rate of the
P/G followed by DOC sequence treatment. Secondary
endpoints were the evaluation of safety profile (acute,
chronic, and delayed toxicities), time to progression,
and survival. The study was therefore designed as a
Phase II trial according to the method described by
A’Hern.17 A sample size of 52 patients was considered
sufficient to give an 80% probability of rejecting
a baseline response rate of 20% with an exact 1%
1-sided significance test when the true response rate
was 40%. The drug regimen should have been considered for further studies if at least 18 responses to
the sequential treatment were observed. All patients
enrolled were considered in the intention-to-treat
population (ITT) evaluated for the efficacy and safety
analysis.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Fifty-two eligible patients with advanced NSCLC were
enrolled in the study (Table 1). Thirty-nine (75%)
were men and 13 (25%) were women, with a median
age of 58 years (range, 36–73 years). Forty-four (85%)
patients had stage IV disease and 8 (15%) patients
had stage IIIB disease. Thirty-eight (73%) patients
had an ECOG PS of 0 and 14 (27%) had an ECOG
PS of 1. Twenty-eight patients had adenocarcinoma,
8 had squamous cell carcinoma, 11 had large-cell
carcinoma, and 5 had undifferentiated lung cancer
nonsmall-cell carcinoma. All 52 patients received 3
cycles of P/G; of these, 13 patients went off protocol
before the DOC cycle because of PD (10 patients),
informed consent withdrawal (2 patients), and treatment delay more than 3 weeks because of severe
disphagia (1 patient). Thirty-nine patients went on

weeks of DOC received was 6. Both phases of the
treatment protocol were well tolerated and there
were no toxic deaths. Six (11.5%) patients underwent
a dose modification almost entirely due to myelosuppression during the P/G phase, whereas no dose
reductions or delays were necessary during the
weekly administration of DOC. We observed mainly
hematologic toxicities. In the first phase 8 patients
experienced grade 3–4 neutropenia (15.3%) and
1 patient had grade 3 thrombocytopenia (1.9%); only
2 patients (3.8%) experienced grade 3 febrile neutropenia. In the DOC phase only 1 patient experienced
grade 3 neutropenia. Nonhematologic toxicities were
relatively uncommon and moderate in both phases.
Peripheral neurotoxicity, nail changes, or conjunctivitis were not observed with weekly administration of
DOC. Reversible allergic reactions were observed in
2 patients after DOC administration and did not
require treatment discontinuation.

to receive weekly DOC, of whom 19 completed 2
planned cycles (Fig. 1). Reasons for treatment discontinuation other than PD were radiotherapy treatment in 3 stage IIIB patients.

Response and Survival
Of the 52 patients who received P/G, 2 (3.9%) experienced a complete response (CR), 15 (28.8%) a partial
response (PR) with a relative risk (RR) of 32.7% (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 19–45), 25 (48%) patients
had stable disease, and 10 (19.3%) patients experienced PD. During the weekly DOC phase, 6 patients
who had had an objective response to P/G experienced further improvement, 4 patients maintained
the response, and 4 patients progressed. Similarly,
2 patients with stable disease to P/G had further
tumor shrinkage that reached the criteria for PR,
12 patients remained stable, and 11 patients progressed. The overall response rate (ORR) to the entire
sequential treatment was 36.5% (95% CI: 23–49).
Median response duration was 7 months (range, 4–
25 months). Figure 2 illustrates the Kaplan-Meier
survival curve for all 52 patients. The median overall
survival was 11 months (95% CI: 9–13); the median
progression-free survival was 6 months (95% CI:
5–7); and the 1- and 2-year survivals were 48% and
25%, respectively. One- and 2-year progression-free
survivals were 12% and 8%, respectively.
Toxicity
A total of 156 cycles of P/G and 328 weekly doses of
DOC were administered. The median number of

DISCUSSION
Our results demonstrate the feasibility and tolerability of a sequential strategy with P/G followed by
weekly DOC as first-line treatment of patients with
advanced NSCLC. The rationale for such an approach
is that tumor resistance to a given combination of
cytotoxic drugs would be circumvented by the
sequential use of a third drug and the cumulative
toxicity associated with the prolonged administration
of a platinum-containing doublet or with the simultaneous combination of more than 2 drugs would be
avoided. The safety profile of our regimen is comparably better than other Phase II-III trials using conventional doublets in which a high rate of severe
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, renal toxicity, and neuropathy is reported.18–20 This issue is of
particular importance given the palliative nature of
treatment. In our study there were no treatmentrelated deaths. Grade 3–4 neutropenia was observed
in 15.3% of the patients receiving P/G, with only
2 patients experiencing grade 3 febrile neutropenia.
Furthermore, in the first phase of the present study
the incidence of grade 3 thrombocytopenia was 1.9%.
Peripheral neurotoxicity, nail changes, or conjunctivitis were not observed with weekly administration of
docetaxel. Thus, as observed in the DISTAL-1 randomized Phase III trial, as well as in a recent metaanalysis, weekly scheduling of docetaxel remarkably
reduces myelotoxicity in pretreated NSCLC patients
without decreasing antitumoral activity.16,21
In our study 85% of the patients were at stage IV
and 61% had 2 or more sites of distant metastasis.
The antitumor activity was within the expected range,

with a best overall RR of 36.5%, a median survival
time of 11 months, and a 1-year survival rate of 48%.
Nine of the patients at stage IV had brain metastasis
and a median progression-free survival of 6 months
(95% CI: 5–7) and an overall survival of 10 months
(CI: 95% 6–14) for these patients were reported. It
should be pointed out that because 3 of them attained a PR and 1 a CR, systemic chemotherapy may
produce responses in brain lesions.
In conclusion, while waiting for a tailored, more
rational approach to lung cancer treatment, whether
evaluating EGFR mutations or the level of the excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) gene,
empirical strategies using chemotherapeutic drugs
are still a reasonable alternative. In this context, the
sequential regimen consisting of P/G followed by
weekly DOC appears to have a favorable cost-benefit
ratio in terms of extremely manageable toxicity
(especially with regard to cumulative neurotoxicity)
and activity and could therefore be considered for
further evaluation.
