Abstract

Introduction

Acquired resistance to protein kinase C (PKC) modulators may
explain the failure of clinical trials in patients with cancer.
Herein, we established a human colon cancer cell line
resistant to PEP005, a drug that inhibits PKCA and activates
PKCD. Colo205-R cells, selected by stepwise exposure to
PEP005, were >300-fold more resistant to PEP005 than
parental Colo205-S cells and were cross-resistant to phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate, bryostatin, bistratene A, and staurosporine. No PKCA or PKCD mutation was detected in
Colo205-S and Colo205-R cells. Changes in Colo205-R cells
were reminiscent of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) phenotype. Accordingly, Colo205-R cells were more
invasive than Colo205-S in Matrigel assays and in mouse
xenografts. We also found an increased mRNA expression of
several EMT genes, such as those encoding for transforming
growth factor-B and vimentin, along with a decreased mRNA
expression of genes involved in epithelial differentiation, such
as CDH1 (E-cadherin), CLDN4 (claudin 4), S100A4, and MUC1,
in Colo205-R compared with Colo205-S cells in vitro and
in vivo. Interestingly, high expression of ET-1 was shown
in Colo205-R cells and correlated with low sensitivity to
PEP005 and staurosporine in a panel of 10 human cancer cell
lines. Inhibition of the ET-1 receptor ETR-A with bosentan
restored the antiproliferative effects of PEP005 in Colo205-R
cells and decreased the invasive properties of this cell line.
Exogenous exposure to ET-1 and silencing ET-1 expression
using small interfering RNA modulated cell signaling in
Colo205-S and Colo205-R. In summary, acquired resistance
to PEP005 was associated with expression of EMT markers
and activates the ET-1/ETR-A cell signaling. [Cancer Res
2009;69(10):4260–9]

Protein kinase Cs (PKC) play a key role in signal transduction (1).
PKCs include at least 12 isoforms with varying tissue expression,
substrate specificity, and subcellular localization that are related
to specialized cellular functions, including cell differentiation,
proliferation, apoptosis, motility, adhesion, invasion, and metastasis (2–4). Among PKC isoforms, PKCa and PKCy were shown to
play a major role in the balance of proliferation and apoptosis as
well as tumor invasion (5). PKCa and PKCy may be activated by
several transmembrane receptors, including G protein–coupled
receptors such as endothelin receptors (ETR-A/B) and several
tyrosine kinase receptors such as epidermal growth factor
receptors (EGFR), platelet derived growth factor receptors, and
the tumor necrosis factor a receptor. Following surface receptor
stimulation, activation of PKCy by diacylglycerol may eventually
result in apoptosis induction in human cancer cell lines (6, 7).
Furthermore, down-regulation of PKCy activity has been shown to
inhibit apoptosis and to induce resistance to DNA-damaging
agents (8–10). PKCa expression was shown to be associated with
changes in the invasion capacity of cancer cells (11). Various
factors may increase the level and/or activity of PKCa, including
ETR-A and ETR-B activation by ET-1 (12, 13). Phosphorylated
PKCa (p-PKCa) may activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2, Jun NH2terminal kinase, and nuclear transcription factors nuclear factornB (NF-nB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1; refs. 14, 15). Following
activation by PKCa, NF-nB, and AP-1 can (a) induce mRNA
expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its
receptors, (b) induce the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP) 9 and MMP2, and (c) repress the expression of tissue
inhibitors of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 1 and
TIMP2, which in turn may increase the invasion capacity of cancer
cells. Recently, both PKCa and ET-1 have been shown to play a role
in epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT), leading to an
increase of the metastatic potential of cancer cells (16, 17).
PKCs have been considered as attractive targets for the discovery
of new anticancer agents. For example, bistratene A, a selective
activator of PKCy, induces apoptosis in human colon cancer cells
(18). Consistent with this, PKCy knockdown by RNA interference
(RNAi) and/or dominant-negative mutation was shown to increase
proliferation and to inhibit apoptosis in colon cancer cells (18).
Similarly, PKCy inhibition by rottlerin, a drug that competes with
ATP, has been shown to prevent the induction of proapoptotic
effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in prostate cancer
cells (19, 20). Ingenol derivatives are structurally closely related to

EMT Expression in Resistance to PKC Modulators

PMA and have been used in traditional medicines. PEP005 (ingenol
3-angelate), a small molecule extracted from Euphorbia peplus (21),
was initially developed as a topical treatment for actinic keratosis
or basal cell skin carcinoma and was recently proposed for the
treatment of acute myeloid leukemias. PEP005 was shown to
inhibit PKCa and to activate PKCy translocation to cytoplasmic
and nuclear membranes in leukemia (21, 22) and in colon cancer
models, inducing apoptosis through inhibition of the AKT signaling
pathway (23).
Despite evidence of sporadic antitumor activity, resistance to
PKC modulators has been a major concern and most drugs
investigated in clinical trials had little or no effect on time-totumor progression and survival (24). Mechanisms by which cancer
cells may become resistant to drugs that target PKC are still poorly
understood and may require further investigations to help improve
patient selection in clinical trials. Colorectal cancer remains a
leading cause of death both through local invasion and distant
metastases. In this study, we investigated mechanisms associated
with resistance to PEP005 and other PKC modulators in human
colon cancer cells, aiming to identify relevant molecular markers
of resistance. We showed that resistance to PKC modulators was
associated with changes in cellular morphology, invasion, and gene
expression, which were reminiscent of a mesenchymal phenotype.
Our study may help in understanding the mechanisms associated
with acquired resistance to PKC modulators and could serve in
identifying resistant tumors in clinical trials.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Human cancer cell lines, colon (HT29, HCT116, Colo205, and
HCC2998), breast (MCF7 and MDA-MB-435), lung (HOP62 and HOP92),
and ovarian (OVCAR3 and IGROV1), were obtained from the National
Cancer Institute and American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown
as monolayer in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen),
2 mmol/L glutamine, 100 units units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. All cell lines were tested
regularly for Mycoplasma contamination by PCR using a Stratagene kit.
Drugs. Purified PEP005 (ingenol 3-angelate) was supplied by PEPLIN
Ltd. PMA, bryostatin 1, bistratene A, rottlerin, and staurosporine were
purchased from Sigma. Bosentan was purchased from Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
Cell cytotoxicity assay. Cell viability was determined using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
(Sigma). The conversion of yellow water-soluble tetrazolium MTT into
purple insoluble formazan is catalyzed by mitochondrial dehydrogenases
(25) and is used to estimate the number of viable cells. In brief, cells were
seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2  103 per well. Cells
were incubated with 0.4 mg/mL MTT for 4 h at 37jC. After incubation, the
supernatant was discarded, insoluble formazan precipitates were dissolved
in 0.1 mL DMSO, and the absorbance was measured at 560 nm by use of
a microplate reader (Thermo). Wells with untreated cells or with drugcontaining medium without cells were used as positive and negative
controls, respectively. Growth inhibition curves were plotted as a
percentage of untreated control cells.
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L sodium
vanadate, 100 mmol/L NaF, and 0.4 mg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.
Equal amounts of protein (20 Ag/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with
5% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in 0.01% Tween 20/PBS and then
incubated with the primary antibody overnight. Membranes were then
washed and incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase. Bands were visualized by using the enhanced
chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system. Densitometric

analysis was performed under conditions that yielded a linear response. The
following antibodies were used: anti-PKCa, anti-PKCy, anti–phosphorylated
p38 (p-p38), anti–phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), anti–phosphorylated
AKT (p-AKT), anti–phosphorylated S6K (p-S6K), anti–phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3h (p-GSK3h), anti–p-PKCa, anti–p-PKCy, and
phosphorylated Raf [p-Raf; monoclonal antibody (mAb); purchased from Cell
Signaling]; ET-1 mAb (Abnova); and ETR-A mAb (Tebu-Bio). The anti-PKCa
and anti-PKCy antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution; the anti–ET-1 and
anti–ETR-A antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution.
Gelatin zymography. The presence of the gelatinases MMP2 and MMP9
in the serum-free conditioned medium and in cells was analyzed by
zymography in 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/mL gelatin
(Sigma) as described previously (26). The gels were scanned using the Scion
computer-based image analysis software.
Invasion assay. Membranes (8 Am) were coated with Matrigel (50 Ag).
The inserts were placed within a 24-well chamber containing 0.75 mL RPMI
1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum as chemoattractant. Cells (2  105) were
seeded into the inserts suspended in 0.5 mL of serum-free RPMI 1640. After
incubation for 24 h at 37jC in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2), the upper surface
of the filter was scraped to remove nonmigratory cells. Migrated cells were
fixed and stained with a Diff-Quik detection kit (Becton Dickinson). For
quantification, the average number of migrating cells per field was assessed
by counting 10 random fields under a light microscope (400).
Gene sequencing. The sequences of PKCa- and PKCy-coding exons
were used to design primers for amplicons covering these regions. DNA
from Colo205-S and Colo205-R cells was amplified by PCR with these
primers and sequenced using fluorescent dye terminators. Sequences were
verified by automated DNA sequencing using a DNA sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems).
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. The theoretical and practical
aspects of real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using
the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Perkin-Elmer Applied
Biosystems) have been described in detail elsewhere (27). Results were
expressed as n-fold differences in target gene expression relative to the TBP
gene (an endogenous RNA control) and relative to a calibrator (1 sample),
consisting of the cell line sample from our tested series that contained the
smallest amount of target gene mRNA.
Immunofluorescence. The cells were grown on coverslips at 37jC
overnight. The growth medium was then removed; the cells were washed
with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with
PBS/Triton X-100 (1:1,000), and then washed with PBS. Incubation with
primary antibodies was performed at room temperature for 1 h (ET-1, 1:200;
ETR-A, 1:400) followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclei were stained
with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes).
The images were captured and analyzed with a RT Spot Camera and RT
Spot Software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.).
ET-1-small interfering RNA. Two different ET-1 RNAi oligonucleotides
or scrambled small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides (100 nmol/L)
were transfected into the cells using the BLOCK-iT transfection kit and
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were then incubated for 72 h.
ET-1 ELISA. ET-1 protein in cell culture supernatants and lysates was
quantified using ELISA (Immuno-Biological Laboratories). Cells (5  105/mL)
were seeded in six-well plates and supernatants or lysates of cell cultures were
collected after 24 h. The liquid was turned yellow by the addition of stop
solution. The absorbance of each well was determined at 450 nm using a
microplate reader. The lower limit of detection for ELISA was 0.78 pg/mL.
Concentrations of ET-1 were calculated using calibrating curves.
Xenograft models. Female (three to six) nu/nu athymic mice were
engrafted in the Animal Facility of the Institute of Hematology, Saint-Louis
Hospital (Paris, France). At baseline, 10 mm3 fragments of Colo205-S and
Colo205-R tumors were xenografted s.c. under xylazine (10 mg/kg) and
ketamine (100 mg/kg) anesthesia. Mice were sacrificed at different times;
tumors were weighed and stored in liquid nitrogen, alcohol-formalin-acetic
acid, and glutaraldehyde for molecular biology and immunohistochemical
analysis. Mouse experiments were approved by the Animal Housing and
Experiment Board of the French government.

Results
PEP005-resistant Colo205 cells display cross-resistance to
several PKC modulators. The antiproliferative effects of
48-hour exposure to PEP005 were determined in IGROV1 (IC50:
200 F 42 Amol/L), OVCAR3 (IC50: 200 F 40 Amol/L), MCF7 (IC50:
180 F 36 Amol/L), HT29 (IC50: 140 F 28 Amol/L), HCT116
(IC50: 120 F 24 Amol/L), HOP62 (IC50: 110 F 32 Amol/L), HOP92
(IC50: 85 F 17 Amol/L), HCC2998 (IC50: 30 F 6 Amol/L), MDA-MB435 (IC50: 3 F 0.5 Amol/L), and Colo205-S cells (IC50: 0.01 F 0.001
Amol/L), Colo205-S being the most sensitive cancer cells.
We established the Colo205-R–resistant cell line from Colo205-S
cells using a stepwise exposure to increasing PEP005 concentrations. After 3 months of exposure and 44 passages, cells were

able to grow in medium containing 3 Amol/L PEP005. Resistance
to PEP005 was shown to be nonreversible after z20 passages. Cell
doubling time (48 hours) was similar in both cell lines and
fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed no significant
change in cell cycle distribution between Colo205-R and Colo205-S
cells (data not shown). Colo205-R cells (IC50: >10 Amol/L) were
>300-fold more resistant to PEP005 (Fig. 1A, top) than parental
Colo205-S cells. The protein and mRNA levels of PKCa were 10-fold
lower in Colo205-R than in Colo205-S cells, with no difference
in PKCy mRNA and protein expressions (Fig. 1A, bottom). No
mutation of PKCa and PKCy was detected in Colo205-S and
Colo205-R cells (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 1B, Colo205R cells were cross-resistant to all PKCy activators, including

EMT Expression in Resistance to PKC Modulators

PEP005, PMA, bryostatin, and bistratene A. In addition, some level
of cross-resistance between PEP005 and staurosporine was also
observed in Colo205-R cells. IC50s of 5-fluorouracil, SN38, and
oxaliplatin were similar in Colo205-S and Colo205-R cells (data not
shown).
Acquired resistance to PEP005 is associated with morphologic changes and increased invasive capacity reminiscent
of EMT. Colo205-S cells displayed round shapes (Fig. 2A, top),
clustered together, were easily detached from plastic plates, and
underwent some level of anoikis. In contrast, Colo205-R cells did
not cluster together and lost the round shape, instead showing
scattered elongated cells with lamellipodia/filopodia-like formations (Fig. 2A, bottom); these cells were more adherent to plastic
plates and seemed to be more resistant to anoikis than Colo205-S
cells. Furthermore, Colo205-R cells were >3-fold more invasive than
Colo205-S cells in Matrigel assay (Fig. 2B).
Subsequently, Colo205-S and Colo205-R cells were injected s.c. in
nude mice. As shown in Fig. 2C, the growth of Colo205-R cells was
significantly higher than that of Colo205-S cells (two-sided P < 0.05
at days 14, 21, and 27). Liver and lung metastases were infrequent
with no significant difference between Colo205-S and Colo205-R
xenografts. Microscope analysis showed that tumors induced by
Colo205-S cells yielded typical well-differentiated adenocarcinomas

with glandular structures and with a well-delineated rim of stromal
cells (Fig. 2D, a and b). Conversely, Colo205-R–induced tumors
were poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with elongated cells,
no glandular formation, and with cancer cells invading the
peripheral rim of the tumor in surrounding tissues, including
adipose areas and muscles (Fig. 2D, c and d). These data showing
that Colo205-R cells display morphologic changes in cultured cells
and tumors, as well as increased invasive capacities in vitro and
in vivo, were reminiscent of EMT.
Changes in EMT markers induced by PEP005 in cultured
Colo205 cells. We investigated mRNA expression levels of a panel
of selected EMT markers in cultured Colo205-S and Colo205-R
cells. First, we evaluated changes in the mRNA expression profile of
several genes known to play a role in EMT in cultured Colo205-S
cells exposed to PEP005. PEP005 exposure in Colo205-S cells was
shown to increase mRNA expression of several genes encoding
for transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h), transcription factors
Snail1, Snail2, and TWIST, and the adhesion molecule claudin 4
(data not shown). Conversely, fibronectin and ET-1 mRNA
expression decreased in Colo205-S cells after exposure to PEP005.
Subsequently, we compared the mRNA expression profiles of genes
involved in cellular differentiation and EMT in Colo205-S and
Colo205-R cells (Fig. 3A). mRNA encoding for genes frequently

B, in an in vitro Matrigel assay, Colo205-R cells
were more invasive (two-sided P < 0.01) than

were shown to grow more rapidly (two-sided
P < 0.01 at days 14, 21, and 27) than Colo205-S
tumors in nude mice. In mice, pathologic
examination of tumors (D ) showed that Colo205-S
cells yield well-differentiated adenocarcinomas (a ),
with no invasion of surrounding tissues (b).
Conversely, Colo205-R xenografts yield
undifferentiated tumors (c ) that invade surrounding
muscle and adipose tissues (d).

Figure 3. mRNA expression of genes involved in EMT in cultured Colo205-S and Colo205-R cells and xenografts. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of genes involved in
the EMT, including Snail1/SNAIL, MMP9, ICAM-1, TAGLN, FN1, ET-1 , TGF-h/TGFB1, SPARC , N-cadherin/CDH2 , TWIST/TWIST1, ACTA2 , vimentin, Snail2/SLUG ,
claudin 4/CLDN4 , E-cadherin/CDH1, S100A4, MUC1 , and connexin 32/CX32. A, increased mRNA expression of several EMT genes was observed in Colo205-R
relative to Colo205-S cells. B, in mice, Colo205-R xenografts expressed decreased levels of several genes involved in epithelial differentiation (top ) and increased
levels of several genes involved in mesenchymal transition (bottom ) compared with Colo205-S tumors (quantitative RT-PCR analysis). Cancer cells in Colo205-S
xenograft (C ) expressed higher levels of E-cadherin compared with Colo205-R (D ) as measured by immunohistochemistry.

expressed in differentiated colorectal cancer, such as S100A4, a
target of the Wnt/h-catenin pathway, and MUC1, encoding for a
mucin, was lower in Colo205-R than in Colo205-S cells, suggesting
dedifferentiation. We also found that the mRNA expression of
several EMT markers of mesenchymal differentiation was
increased in Colo205-R cells, including growth factors (TGF-h/
TGFB1 and ET-1), transcription factors (Snail1/SNAIL, Snail2/
SLUG, and TWIST1), invasion molecules (N-cadherin/CDH2,
vimentin, fibronectin1/FN1, ICAM-1, and MMP9), and various other
molecular markers of mesenchymal differentiation (TAGLN,
ACTA2, and SPARC). Accordingly, mRNA expression of epithelial
markers, such as the adhesion molecules claudin 4 (CLDN4),
E-cadherin (CDH1), and connexin 32 (CX32), was decreased in
Colo205-R compared with Colo205-S cells. The enzymatic activity
of MMP9 and MMP2 was evaluated by gelatin zymography. MMP2
activity was shown to be increased in Colo205-R compared with
Colo205-S cells. Although MMP9 mRNA expression was higher in
Colo205-R than Colo205-S cells, the enzymatic activity was similar
in both cell lines. Consistent with mRNA expression, the protein
level of ET-1 was higher, whereas E-cadherin and claudin 4 protein

levels were lower in Colo205-R than Colo205-S cells (data not
shown).
EMT markers in Colo205-S and Colo205-R xenografts. We
further investigated mRNA expression levels of a panel of selected
EMT markers in Colo205-S and Colo205-R xenografts. The
increased invasiveness of Colo205-R xenografts was associated
with increased mRNA expression of several genes involved in EMT
and invasion and decreased mRNA expression of genes involved in
adhesion. As shown in Fig. 3B, mRNA expression levels of several
genes involved in epithelial differentiation and adhesion, such as
CDH1 (E-cadherin), CLDN4 (claudin 4), S100A4, MUC1, and CX32
(connexin 32), were decreased, whereas mesenchymal markers,
including TGFB1 (TGF-h) and vimentin expression levels, were
increased in Colo205-R compared with Colo205-S tumors. In
addition, Colo205-R xenografts expressed higher mRNA levels of
EMT genes, including TWIST and SLUG (Snail2), as well as other
genes involved in invasion, such as ACTA2, HMGA2 (HMG
proteins), PAI1, and SPARC (osteonectin). Unlike those in cultured
cells, ET-1 and SNAIL (Snail1) mRNA levels were similar in
Colo205-R and Colo205-S xenografts. Immunoassay of tumors

showed that both Colo205-S and Colo205-R xenografts expressed
epithelial AE1-3 markers. However, Colo205-S tumor cells expressed
high membrane staining for E-cadherin (Fig. 3C), whereas no
expression of E-cadherin was detectable in Colo205-R xenografts
(Fig. 3D).
Autocrine secretion and exogenous exposure to ET-1
increase resistance to PEP005 in vitro. Because ET-1 was
recently shown to be an important growth factor that may promote
EMT in cancer cells (12, 13, 17, 28), we further focused our work on
the mRNA and protein expression levels of ET-1 in Colo205-S
exposed to PEP005 and in Colo205-R. As described above, Colo205-S
cells exposed to PEP005 had a decreased expression of ET-1.
Conversely, Colo205-R cells that display a mesenchymal phenotype
had an increased expression of mRNA and protein levels of ET-1.
ET-1 is synthesized as a large precursor polypeptide, named
pre-pro endothelin-1, which is cleaved into an intermediate
peptide, the bigET-1. The bigET-1 is then cleaved by an
endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) to produce the mature ET-1
that binds to two high-affinity serpentine receptor subtypes, ETR-A
and ETR-B. In this study, we found that ETR-B was not expressed
in Colo205-S or Colo205-R cells (data not shown). We observed a
diffuse intracellular localization of ET-1 and a predominant
membrane localization of ETR-A in Colo205-S and Colo205-R cells
(data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4A, mRNA expressions of ECE-1
and ET-1 were increased in Colo205-R compared with Colo205-S
cells, whereas ETR-A expression was similar in both cell lines.
Western blot analysis showed that ET-1 and ETR-A proteins were
both increased in the Colo205-R cells compared with Colo205-S
cells (Fig. 4B). In addition, we observed a 3-fold increase of ET-1
concentrations both in conditioning medium and in cell lysate in

Colo205-R compared with Colo205-S cells using the ELISA assay
(Fig. 4C). The increased concentration of ET-1 was consistent with
an increase of ECE-1 mRNA expression level. To test whether ET-1
itself may play a role in resistance to PEP005, we evaluated the
antiproliferative effects of PEP005 in Colo205-S cells with and
without pretreatment with exogenous ET-1 at a supraphysiologic
high concentration of 100 nmol/L that was previously shown
capable of activating PKC signaling. As shown in Fig. 4D,
preexposure to ET-1 was associated with decreased sensitivity to
PEP005 in Colo205-S cells. Colo205-R cells expressed a higher level
of EGFR than Colo205-S cells both at mRNA and protein levels.
EGFR was activated only in Colo205-S, this activation being
inhibited by a 4-hour exposure to ET-1 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
ET-1 expression is increased in cancer cells resistant to PKC
modulators. To test whether ET-1 may play a role in resistance in
other cancer cells, we further measured the mRNA expression of
ET-1, along with that of claudin 4 (CLDN4), PKCa, and PKCy, in our
panel of 10 cancer cell lines tested for sensitivity to PEP005 and
staurosporine. Attempts were made to correlate the expression
of these biomarkers with the antiproliferative activity of PEP005
and staurosporine. We showed no clear correlation between IC50
values of PEP005 (Fig. 5A) or staurosporine (Fig. 5B) and mRNA
expression of PKCa, PKCy, and claudin 4/CLDN4. Interestingly,
the mRNA expression levels of ET-1 were correlated with resistance
to PEP005 (r 2 = 0.62; P = 0.004) and staurosporine (r 2 = 0.60;
P = 0.006), with those cancer cells resistant to PEP005 showing
the highest expression of ET-1. Thus, the increased expression of
ET-1 in Colo205-R cells, and the high expression of ET-1 in cancer
cells resistant to PEP005 and staurosporine, suggested that ET-1
may be an important growth factor for cell survival in the presence

of PEP005. This also suggested that mRNA expression of ET-1 may
be regarded as a potential molecular marker of resistance not only
in Colo205-R cells with an acquired resistance to PEP005 but also
in unselected cancer cells that display various levels of sensitivity to
PEP005 and staurosporine.
Changes in signaling induced by PEP005 in Colo205 cells.
PEP005 was shown to act primarily through the activation of

p-PKCy and inhibition of p-PKCa, leading to the activation of p-Raf
(data not shown), p-p38, and p-ERK1/2 MAPK signaling as well as
inhibition of p-AKT and activation of p-GSK3h (Fig. 6A). Exposure
of Colo205-R cells to PEP005 showed modest effects on PKCa,
PKCy, p38, ERK1/2, and AKT phosphorylation levels but a strong
activation of GSK3h. Exposure of Colo205-S cells to ET-1 yielded a
slight increase of p-PKCa, down-expression of p-p38 and p-GSK3h,

EMT Expression in Resistance to PKC Modulators

and no major changes in p-PKCy and p-S6K. ET-1 exposure
prevented the expected inhibition of p-PKCa, limited the increase
of p-PKCy, and modified downstream changes in p38, GSK3h, and
S6K signaling normally induced by PEP005 and PMA in Colo205-S
cells (data not shown).
Effects of inhibition of the ET1/ETR-A axis in Colo205 cells.
Bosentan is a competitive antagonist of endothelin receptor that
was previously shown inhibiting ET-1–induced ETR-A/B activation
at concentration z80 Amol/L. As shown in Fig. 6B, inhibition of
ETR-A with 100 Amol/L bosentan restored sensitivity to PEP005
in Colo205-R cells. Moreover, Colo205-R cells exposed to bosentan
had a 10-fold decreased invasive capacity compared with untreated
Colo205-R (Fig. 6C). Colo205-R cells were transfected with ET-1siRNA (siET-1). Transfection with siET-1 selectively decreased ET-1
mRNA and protein levels as well as the extracellular concentrations
of ET-1 in Colo205-R cells (data not shown). No significant change
of ECE-1, PKCa, and PKCy total protein levels was detected.

Transfection was unstable and Lipofectamine had intrinsic toxicity
that did not allow completion of reliable cytotoxicity and invasion
assays with siET-1–transfected Colo205-R cells. siET-1 had no
relevant effects on baseline signaling and response to PEP005 and
PMA in Colo205-S cells. siET-1 transfection of Colo205-R cells
yielded no changes in p-PKCa, p-PKCy, p-ERK1/2, or p-p38 but
increased p-GSK3h. In siET-1–transfected Colo205-R cells, PEP005
was still capable of decreasing p-PKCa and increasing both
p-GSK3h and p-ERK1/2 (Fig. 6D) with almost no effects on PKCy
and p-p38 (data not shown). Altogether, these data show that the
ET-1/ETR-A axis modulates cellular response to PEP005 in Colo205
cells.

Discussion
In previous studies, it has been shown that PEP005 inhibits
PKCa and activates PKCy, yielding late G1 cell cycle accumulation

and induction of apoptosis (22). We previously showed that
exposure to PEP005 modulates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT and ERK1/2 signaling through complex mechanisms
in Colo205-S cells (23). Caspase-3 cleavage was described as being
associated with PKCy activation, leading to apoptosis in cells
treated with PEP005. Previous studies have also shown that some
cancer cells may be exquisitely sensitive to PEP005, whereas others
required high concentrations barely compatible with clinical
uses and may be considered as intrinsically resistant to PEP005.
Considering that most previous clinical trials with several PKC
inhibitors failed to show consistent antitumor activity (24), it
seemed essential to identify molecular mechanisms of resistance
that may serve to select patients with tumors unlikely to benefit
from PEP005 therapy. In this study, we first selected Colo205-S
among a panel of cancer cells as being the most sensitive cancer
cell line. We further selected Colo205-R by stepwise increased
PEP005 concentrations. Resistance of Colo205-R to PEP005 was
nonreversible in drug-free medium after several passages. Interestingly, Colo205-R cells also display cross-resistance to several
other PKCy activators, including PMA, bryostatin, and bistratene A,
as well as PKCy inhibitors, such as staurosporine. As shown in this
study, mRNA expression and protein levels of the target PKCa were
found to be decreased in Colo205-R, whereas no difference for
PKCy was observed. However, whereas acquired resistance was
associated with down-expression of PKCa, no correlation between
PKCy and PKCa expression and sensitivity to PEP005 was observed
in a larger number of human cancer cell lines. Thus far, large-scale
genomic screening has failed to identify PKCa and PKCy mutations
in human colon cancer (29). Although no mutation of PKCy was
reported, potential important sites for PKCy mutations were
regions coding for tyrosine phosphorylation sites (30). PKCaD294G mutants were found in pituitary, breast, and thyroid tumors
resulting in altered membrane binding, thereby preventing the
transduction of several antitumorigenic signals, and increasing
the invasiveness of pituitary tumor cells (31). Because PKCa and
PKCy were the primary targets of PEP005, we searched and found
no mutation in exons coding for PKCa and PKCy in Colo205-S
and Colo205-R cells. Our data supported the possibility that other
genomic events, beyond target mutations, occurred to counteract
the cytotoxicity of PEP005 in Colo205-R cells.
In this study, transcription of TGF-h was activated under
exposure to PEP005 along with that of some other transcription
factors of EMT. Previous studies have shown that TGF-h–related
tumor suppressor activity led to apoptosis by repressing the PI3K/
AKT/survivin pathway in colon cancer cells (32). We further
studied the role of TGF-h in sensitivity to PEP005. We observed
that short-duration exposure of Colo205-S cells to exogenous TGFh had no effect on the phosphorylations of PKCy, ERK1/2, and p38
but increased p-S6 activity. Exogenous exposure to TGF-h had no
effect on the cytotoxicity of PEP005 in Colo205-S cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition to direct effects of PEP005 on PKCs,
the increased transcription of TGF-h may participate in the
inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway and contribute to caspase-3/
PKCy–dependent apoptosis induced by PEP005 in Colo205-S cells.
Continuous exposure to PEP005 induced strong and stable TGF-h
overexpression associated with the activation of the transcription
machinery, leading to the overexpression of several transcription
factors, such as Snail1, Snail2, and TWIST, as well as cellular
changes that were reminiscent of EMT in Colo205-R. The tumor
promoter function of TGF-h has been associated with its ability to
induce EMT, which confers resistance to the apoptotic effects of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

TGF-h. Thus, our data strongly suggest that Colo205-R cells have
escaped from both PKCy-dependent and TGF-h–mediated mechanisms that initially participated in apoptosis induced by PEP005
and a broad number of PKCy modulators in Colo205-S cells.
EMT plays a central role in cancer progression, allowing cells to
develop invasive competences by changing adhesive properties,
by activating proteolysis and motility (33), and by repressing the
expression and/or the function of intercellular adhesion molecules,
including E-cadherin, claudin 4, and connexin 32 (34–37).
Consistently, Colo205-R cells were poorly differentiated and had
an increased invasive potential in vitro and in vivo. We also showed
that resistance to PKC modulators was associated with changes in
genes involved in EMT, including the overexpression of vimentin,
and genes involved in invasion (N-cadherin, ICAM-1, MMP2, MMP9,
and ACTA2), along with decreased mRNA expression of several
genes involved in adhesion of epithelial cells (E-cadherin, CLDN4,
and CX32). ET-1 is a small vasoactive peptide that was shown to be
expressed at high levels in plasma and tumor tissue samples from
patients with colorectal cancer (38). ET-1 stimulates proliferation
of colorectal cancer cells via the ETR-A receptor and subsequent
activation of pertussis toxin–sensitive Go/Gi proteins, PI3K, PKC,
and transactivation of the EGFR. ET-1 was also previously shown to
play an important role in EMT (12, 17, 39). In this study, we found
that ET-1 and ETR-A were expressed in Colo205-S and Colo205-R
cells. However, the ET-1 level was higher in Colo205-R cells, which
display the EMT phenotype, than in Colo205-S. In addition,
pharmacologic inhibition of ETR-A with bosentan reduced the
invasive capacity of Colo205-R cells. This finding fits with previous
data by Rosanò and colleagues (12, 17) showing that ET-1 was a key
factor in promoting EMT in ovarian human cancer (39). These data
also seemed to be consistent with previously published results
showing reciprocal activation of ET-1 and TGF-h tumor promoter
function in cells undergoing EMT (28). Data previously published
have shown that ET-1/ETR-A promotes nuclear localization and
transcription of Snail, as well as a Snail and h-catenin protein
stabilization, thereby activating a transcriptional program that
regulates EMT determinants. Snail1 represses E-cadherin expression by binding the E-boxes present in its promoter in vitro and
in vivo (39, 40). Our data also showed that Colo205-R cells growing
in xenografts lost the overexpression of ET-1, suggesting that ET-1
overexpression may only be transiently required during the
dedifferentiation process that promotes local invasion and may
not be required anymore in established tumors. ET-1 has been
previously shown to play a role in preventing apoptosis in several
tumor models (12). In this study, we showed that Colo205-S cells
expressed ETR-A and responded to ETR-A stimulation by
exogenous ET-1 by reducing phosphorylation of p38 and GSK3h.
Exogenous ET-1 was also shown to reduce the antiproliferative
effects of PEP005 in Colo205-S. Our data suggested that baseline
ET-1 may not be sufficient to counteract apoptosis induced by
PEP005 in Colo205-S cells but that exogenous activation of ETR-A
by ET-1 may trigger changes in cell signaling that counteract
modulations of PKC by PEP005. Colo205-R cells that become
resistant to PEP005 also activate transcription of ET-1, a
mechanism that induces the autocrine stimulation of cells through
ET1/ETR-A signaling and that will in turn help activation of the
EMT machinery. We have shown that Colo205-R, as well as several
other cancer cells resistant to PEP005, displayed a high level of ET-1
and that ET-1 expression may be regarded as a molecular marker
of resistance to several PKC inhibitors. Furthermore, switching off
the ET-1/ETR-A survival signaling pathway, using pharmacologic

inhibition of ETR-A, restored the sensitivity to PEP005 in Colo205-R
cells. From these data, it is likely that autocrine activation of ET-1/
ETR-A may counteract the apoptotic effects of PKC modulators in
Colo205-R cells by switching on survival mechanisms that take over
when PKCa signaling is down-regulated. Indeed, the blockage of
ET-1/ETR-A–dependent signaling using receptor antagonists may
also be considered as an interesting approach to restore sensitivity
in cells resistant to PKC modulators.
In summary, our work shows that cancer cells resistant to
PEP005 may develop cross-resistance to several other PKC
modulators. Acquired resistance to PEP005 was associated with
EMT. These molecular changes could not only serve as molecular
markers of resistance but also seem to be associated with an
increased invasive capacity of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
Our study may help in understanding the mechanisms associated
with acquired resistance to PKC modulators and could serve in
identifying resistant tumors in clinical trials. Colo205-R cells also
represent a potentially useful tool in gaining insights into the
mode of action of PEP005 in tumor cells and selecting non–cross-
