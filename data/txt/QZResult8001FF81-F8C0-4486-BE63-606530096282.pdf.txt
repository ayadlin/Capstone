ABSTRACT
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) “cholinic phenotype”, characterized by increased
intracellular phosphocholine content sustained by over-expression/activity of choline
kinase-alpha (ChoKα/CHKA), is a metabolic cellular reprogramming involved in
chemoresistance with still unknown mechanisms.
By stable CHKA silencing and global metabolic profiling here we demonstrate
that CHKA knockdown hampers growth capability of EOC cell lines both in vitro and
in xenotransplant in vivo models. It also affected antioxidant cellular defenses,
decreasing glutathione and cysteine content while increasing intracellular levels of
reactive oxygen species, overall sensitizing EOC cells to current chemotherapeutic
regimens. Natural recovering of ChoKα expression after its transient silencing
rescued the wild-type phenotype, restoring intracellular glutathione content and
drug resistance. Rescue and phenocopy of siCHKA-related effects were also obtained
by artificial modulation of glutathione levels. The direct relationship among CHKA
expression, glutathione intracellular content and drug sensitivity was overall
demonstrated in six different EOC cell lines but notably, siCHKA did not affect
growth capability, glutathione metabolism and/or drug sensitivity of non-tumoral
immortalized ovarian cells. The “cholinic phenotype”, by recapitulating EOC addiction
to glutathione content for the maintenance of the antioxidant defense, can be
therefore considered a unique feature of cancer cells and a suitable target to improve
chemotherapeutics efficacy.

INTRODUCTION

[1]. Late diagnosis, frequent relapse and development of
chemoresistance mainly contribute to the unfavourable
prognosis [2]. As in many other cancer types, drug
resistance in EOC is a complex phenomenon associated
with several alterations that affect multiple factors and

pathways [3, 4] including reprogram of cell metabolism
to sustain cell growth and survival [5].
Aberrant metabolism has been recently proposed
as a cancer hallmark [6], and it represents a source
of promising therapeutic targets [7]. In particular,
altered choline metabolism, characterized by increased
phosphocholine (PCho) and total choline-containing
compounds (tCho), is a metabolic hallmark that
reflects the complex reciprocal interactions between
oncogenic signaling and cellular metabolism [8, 9]. In
recent years this altered choline metabolism, has been
reported in different cancer types including breast, lung,
prostate cancer [10-12] and more recently in pancreatic,
endometrial cancer [13, 14] and also in glioma in
association with R132H mutation of IDH1 gene [15].
These observations also provided the molecular basis for
the development of non-invasive imaging approaches
based on choline phosphorylation for the characterization
of tumor growth and response to therapy [8, 16, 17] as
well as the rationale for developing specific inhibitors for
this metabolic pathways even in disease others than cancer
[18, 19].
We described an increase in PCho levels also for
EOC [20, 21] and demonstrated that intracellular PCho
accumulation was sustained by activation of enzymes
involved in phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) biosynthetic and
catabolic pathways. They include: choline kinase (ChoK),
which produces PCho, and PtdCho-specific phospholipase
C which, by degrading PtdCho, contributes to restore the
PCho pool [20, 21]. Choline kinase alpha (ChoKα) plays
a major role in increasing PCho content in EOC through
increased activity and expression [20, 22], whereas the
expression of the beta isoform of the enzyme (ChoKβ)
remained unchanged [22]. We showed that transient downmodulation of ChoKα in EOC cells decreased cell growth,
cell motility and invasion capability, overall weakening the
EOC aggressive phenotype and also increasing sensitivity
to cisplatin (cis-diammine-dichloro-platinum, DDP) and
paclitaxel even in cells exhibiting intrinsic resistance to
DDP like the SKOV3 cell line [23].
Among the various metabolism-related mechanisms
affecting drug sensitivity, high intracellular levels
of reduced glutathione (GSH) have been shown to
contribute in developing resistance to chemotherapeutic
drugs including DDP and doxorubicin [24-26]. GSH is
a thiol peptide which tightly regulates cell redox status
through its antioxidant and reducing activities [27]. Many
conventional antitumor agents have been shown to trigger
cancer cell death by inducing oxidative stress; therefore,
targeting oxidative-stress related pathway is considered a
promising tool to overcome drug resistance [27].
Our present analysis of the global metabolic profile
of CHKA silenced cells disclosed altered glutathione
metabolism. Here we demonstrate that ChoKα is directly
involved in regulation of glutathione-dependent oxidativestress signaling pathway in EOC cells and that targeting

RESULTS
Stable CHKA silencing hampers in vitro and
in vivo EOC aggressiveness and impairs PCho
accumulation
To investigate the dynamics of long-term biological
effects related to CHKA silencing, INTOV11 and
SKOV3 cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector
expressing GFP and specific CHKA shRNA [28]. A
significant 61% ± 1% and 68.3% ± 7.6% reduction of
CHKA mRNA was obtained in sh-CHKA transduced
INTOV11 and SKOV3 cells respectively as compared
to their relative control (ΔLuc) (Figure 1A left panels). A
severe silencing effect was also observed at protein level
where the densitometric analysis showed a proportional
protein down-modulation of 40% ± 5% and 41% ± 9% on
INTOV11 and SKOV3 transduced cell lines, respectively
(Figure 1A, right panels). With the stable transfection
approach we obtained a 44.4%±4.4% and 49.63%±1.76%
in vitro growth inhibition (Figure 1B, left panels) and a
38%±10% and a 61.6%±6% reduction of colony formation
(Figure 1B, right panels) in foci-formation assays for shCHKA INTOV11 and sh-CHKA SKOV3 respectively
as compared to their relative controls. We observed in
sh-CHKA transduced cells a 40% and 51% reduction of
migration capability (Supplementary Figure 1A) and 41%
and 45% inhibition of invasive potential (Supplementary
Figure 1B) compared with their control cells, in INTOV11
and SKOV3 models, respectively. We also showed that
stable CHKA silencing did not affect the main survival
signaling pathways; indeed, phosphorylation level of the
main molecules involved (Akt and ERK1/2 proteins)
remained essentially unchanged in both sh-CHKA models
as compared to their controls (Supplementary Figure 1C).
Given the strong inhibitory effects on in-vitro cell
proliferation by CHKA stable silencing, we evaluated
potential inhibitory effects in in-vivo models. Volumes
of subcutaneously growing tumors were monitored and
a significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed
for both EOC silenced cell lines (Figure 1C, left panels).
Tumors derived from control and sh-CHKA groups were
then analyzed at molecular level. qRT-PCR analysis
reported in Figure 1C (right panels) showed down
modulation of CHKA mRNA expression in sh-CHKA
xenografts of both INTOV11 and SKOV3 as compared to
their relative controls.
CHKA-shRNA lentivirus transduction dramatically
impacted on EOC choline metabolism. Fully relaxed 1HMR spectra performed on water-soluble extracts, showed
that PCho levels were significantly higher in ΔLuc11217

shRNA cells as compared to CHKA-shRNA transduced
cells. Quantitative analysis showed a decrease of 61±9%
and 83±3% of PCho content in sh-CHKA INTOV11 and
SKOV3 cells respectively, as compared to their ΔLucshRNA controls (Figure 1D, left panel; representative
examples are reported in middle and right panels). The
indirect evidence of decreased ChoK-alpha activity
(evaluated as decrease of PCho content) in sh-CHKA cells
was confirmed by the direct measurement of enzymatic
activity in both EOC models. Indeed, consistently with
the reduction of PCho levels in sh-CHKA transduced cells
a significant decrease of 77±16% and 97±32% of ChoK
enzymatic activity as compaired to controls was detected
in INTOV11 and SKOV3 cell lines (Figure 1E).

with seeding times in both cell lines consistent with
time-dependent metabolic adaptation (not shown). The
greatest metabolic changes were observed at 72h post
seeding where a number of metabolites were found to
be down-regulated in CHKA silenced cells. A summary

of biochemicals which achieved statistical significance
(p≤0.05), as well as those approaching significance
(0.05<p<0.10) is reported in Supplementary Figure 2A.
The complete heatmap of significantly altered metabolites
for each cell line is reported in Supplementary Figure 2B.
We identified as commonly altered in the two sh-CHKA
models, metabolic pathways mainly related to amino
acid, lipid and nucleotide metabolism (see Supplementary
Figure 2C for details).
We found of particular interest the alterations related
to glutathione and its precursor cysteine. Indeed, in this
study CHKA stable silencing resulted in a significant
decrease in cysteine levels as compared to the relative
ΔLuc controls in both cellular models (Figure 2A),
coupled with an alteration of glutathione metabolism,
commonly characterized by a 2-fold decrease of oxidized
glutathione (GSSG) content and a 3-fold decrease of
reduced glutathione (GSH) (Figure 2B left panels). A 3040% reduction of GSH/GSSG ratio indicated an overall
decrease in GSH content in sh-CHKA cells as compared to
their controls (Figure 2B, right panels). To independently
validate this observation, we transiently silenced CHKA
expression on INTOV11 and SKOV3 and quantified GSH
and GSSG levels using a luminescence-based system
assay, obtaining a 2 fold reduction of GSH/GSSG ratio
in silenced (si-CHKA) cells compared to their relative
controls (Figure 3A). GSH is known to regulate redox

state through its antioxidant and reducing activities.
Our observations suggested that CHKA knock down, by
altering GSH intracellular levels, may cause an increase
in ROS levels thus impairing antioxidant cellular defense
and possibly enhancing cell responsiveness to drug
treatment. We therefore assessed the ROS intracellular
levels measuring by flow cytometry the fluorescent signal
of CM-H2DCF-DA probe in control and si-CHKA cells.
A 3-fold and a 6-fold increase in intracellular ROS levels
was detected in INTOV11 and in SKOV3 siCHKA cells
respectively as compared to their corresponding controls
(Figure 3B and 3C).
In order to exclude a cell line-dependent effect,
CHKA was silenced in four different EOC cell lines:
IGROV1, A2774, OAW42 and OVCAR5, which have
heterogeneous ChoKα protein expression levels and PCho
intracellular accumulation (Figure 4A and 4B).
In all tested cell lines, CHKA transient silencing
induced an average 60% decrease of ChoKα protein
expression (Figure 4C). Quantification of the GSH/
GSSG ratio showed variable basal intracellular levels of
these biochemicals, however a significant decrease of 2
fold of the GSH/GSSG ratio was confirmed after CHKA
silencing in all models (Figure 4D). To exclude that these
observations could be due to non specific off-target effects,
decrease in GSH content was validated in siCHKA cells
using a second independent CHKA-specific siRNA pool

ROS levels in siCHKA silenced cells as compared to their controls is reported. ROS levels were measured by flow cytometry using the

mean fluorescence index for each sample. C: A representative experiment for each cell line is reported showing the increase in fluorescence

(Supplementary Figure 3).
To verify whether an altered expression of the
cysteine transporter Sxc could account for the observed
decrease in cysteine, we analyzed the expression of
the transporter subunit xCT/SLC7A11 both at mRNA
and protein level (Supplementary Figure 4), and of the
regulatory subunit SLC7A5 at mRNA level (not shown)
and we did not observe any alteration following stable or
transient CHKA silencing, thus excluding a decrease in
cysteine uptake.

upper and lower panels, respectively), mimicking the
pattern of sensitization observed after CHKA silencing
(see Figure 4E and [23] ). As complementary approach,
we examined if we could rescue the resistant phenotype
in INTOV11 and SKOV3 siCHKA cells by restoring the
GSH intracellular levels. The glutathione tripeptide itself
is not cell permeable, therefore to increase its intracellular
content we loaded cells with a membrane/lipid permeable
derivative, Glutathione Reduced Ethyl Ester (GEE) and
we evaluated the capability of GEE treatment to recover
intracellular GSH levels in siCHKA cells. After CHKA
silencing, cells were loaded with GEE for 8h and then
incubated for 48h in its absence, thus mimicking the timeschedule of the drug treatment. GSH/GSSG levels were
monitored and quantified at the end of silencing (t0), after
loading (8h GEE) and at relapse. CHKA silencing caused
in both cell lines the expected two-fold decrease in the
GSH/GSSG ratio as compared to relative controls (Figure
5A, t=0). GEE treatment effectively recovered GSH
levels in both siCHKA cell lines and such an increase was
maintained up to 48h after the end of GEE loading (Figure
5A, green histograms).
Most importantly GSH reloading in siCHKA
cells substantially affected intracellular ROS levels, by
lowering their amount to levels comparable to drug treated
control cells (Figure 5B and 5C).
Significantly, GEE treatment reverted drug
sensitization associated with CHKA silencing, almost
completely retrieving the dose-response curve typical of
wt and control cells (Figure 5D). Rescue of GSH content
and loss of drug sensitization were also observed after

CHKA silencing increases cell sensitivity to drugs
by modulating intracellular GSH levels
CHKA silencing increased sensitivity to drug
treatment in INTOV11 and SKOV3 [23] as well as in the
four additional analyzed EOC cell lines (Figure 4E) where
we validated the GSH decrease following CHKA down
modulation (see Figure 4D).
Since GSH intracellular levels are known to
interfere with cell sensitivity to different antitumor agents
including platinum compounds, we investigated whether
the alteration of GSH/GSSG levels dependent upon CHKA
silencing was the mechanism by which cell sensitivity
was modulated. Thus, to phenocopy the effects of CHKAsilencing, we reduced basal intracellular glutathione
levels treating wild type INTOV11 and SKOV3 cells
with a non toxic concentration of BSO. As hypothesized,
this GSH-depleting agent significantly increases DDP
and doxorubicin sensitivity (Supplementary Figure 5

that EOC aggressiveness may rely, at least in part, also
on the expression and activity of this enzyme. We clearly
showed that the depletion of CHKA expression was
associated to a drop in PCho content and Chok activity,
indicating a predominant role of the alpha isoform in the
build-up of PCho in EOC cells. Furthermore, we did not
observe any significant changes in the levels of PtdCho
in CHKA-silenced cells (data not shown), suggesting
that the phospholipid homeostasis was not substantially
altered under these experimental conditions. ChoK-alpha
activation has been described as a mediator of relevant
survival signaling pathways (MAPK and AKT) and
as a regulator of phosphatidic acid levels [29, 30]. We
previously showed that in a transient siCHKA setting the
phosphorylation status of the main signaling molecules
was not affected by CHKA knock down. We now validated
these observations in stable shCHKA cells where we also
did not detect variation in phosphatidic acid content,
further indicating that CHKA silencing affected different
pathways in EOC cells.
The overall metabolic profiling disclosed an altered
glutathione metabolism characterized by a decreased
cysteine and GSH content in CHKA-silenced cells.
Reduction of GSH content in CHKA silenced cells could
be ascribed to limited cysteine availability or reduced
activity/expression of the two enzymes which, starting
from cysteine, are directly involved in glutathione
synthesis: glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL/GCS) and
glutathione synthase (GS) [27]. Our MS data clearly
showed a decreased cysteine content, thus supporting a
primary role for this precursor in determining the GSH
content. Limited cysteine availability could in turn be
due to both impaired import by SXc carrier or impaired
synthesis by the trans-sulphuration pathway. However
upon CHKA knockdown we did not observed significant
modification of the active transporter subunit of the
SXc carrier (xCT) both at mRNA and protein level, thus
suggesting that reduction of cysteine is not related to
a decreased intake but might predominantly rely on
decrease of the trans-sulphuration pathway. Furthermore,
methionine could also participate (through the methionine
cycle and folate metabolism) in the biosynthesis of the

CHKA silencing does not affect Glutathione
metabolism and/or drug sensitivity in nontumoral ovarian cells
To assess the specific biological impact of GSH
regulation by CHKA expression in EOC cell lines, we
evaluated the GSH/GSSG ratio in the non-tumoral ovarian
cell line I64-hTERT and its possible alteration following
CHKA silencing. The GSH/GSSG ratio was significantly
higher in EOC cells than in I64-hTERT (Figure 7A) and
knock down of CHKA in I64-hTERT cells decreased
ChoK-alpha protein expression (Figure 7B) but it did not
impact on GSH intracellular levels or drug sensitivity
(Figure 7C and 7D). GSH depletion by BSO resulted in
a sensitization of I64-hTERT cells to DDP, suggesting
that in spite of its low basal level, intracellular GSH is
involved in mediating drug cytotoxic effects. However,
no differences were detected between CHKA silenced
and non-silenced cells (Figure 8A and 8B). Indeed, GEE
treatment caused a moderate increase in the GSH levels in
I64-hTERT (Figure 8C), and accordingly no differences
were observed in drug sensitivity of siCHKA, GEE-treated
cells (Figure 8D).

DISCUSSION
Aberrant choline metabolism is now a recognized
metabolic hallmark for different cancer types [8]. We
significantly contributed to define the relevance of this
hallmark in EOC as well, showing that tumor cells have
an increased expression and activation of ChoKα [20, 22]
and that transient CHKA silencing affected cell behavior
in vitro, hampering the aggressive phenotype [23]. These
observations were overall suggestive for a primary
role of altered Chok-α in sustaining the EOC “cholinic
phenotype”.
Here we showed that a stable silencing of CHKA
affected EOC in vivo growth, supporting the hypothesis

sulphur-containing amino acids homocysteine, cysteine,
and taurine and then regulate the trans-sulphuration
pathway and intracellular levels of glutathione [31].
Interestingly both methionine and folate metabolism
pathway were found significantly modulated in the
metabolic heatmap. Since the levels of methionine could
influence proliferation as well as the drug resistance in
cancer cells [32, 33], further studies are warranted to
better clarify the link between the methionine and/or folate
cycles and drug resistance in sh-CHKA cells.
The occurrence of drug resistance represents the
major limit to the efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatment
currently employed for progressive or recurrent EOC
disease, such as a platinum-taxane (the standard first
line therapy) or a platinum-liposomal doxorubicin
combination [34]. However, the mechanisms of cytotoxic
drug resistance in EOC remain elusive. Interestingly, a
cytoprotective role has been proposed for high intracellular
GSH content [24-26] and consistently, increased GSH
content has been observed in different tumor types
[27]. Indeed, besides participating in efflux transportermediated detoxification [26], GSH acts as scavenger of

free radicals and peroxides accumulating in cell during
oxidative stress like the hypoxic condition in tumor
tissues. Therefore, treatments causing GSH depletion, by
perturbing cell redox homeostasis, are expected to render
tumor cells more susceptible to chemotherapeutic agents.
In accordance with this proposed mechanism we observed
that CHKA targeting increased intracellular ROS levels
and sensitivity to DDP and doxorubicin treatment and
these effects were mediated by decreased GSH content.
Indeed, drug sensitivity acquired following CHKA
silencing was lost by restoring, in si-CHKA cells, the
GSH content both artificially or after natural recovery of
Chok-α expression thus confirming the direct relationship
existing among Chok-α expression, GSH content and drug
sensitivity.
Malignant transformation is characterized by
the progressive acquisition of genetic and epigenetic
alterations, frequently involving hyperactivation of
oncogenes and/or inactivation of oncosuppressor genes,
which induce addiction to specific signaling and metabolic
pathways [6]. Moreover, the overall deregulation of
cellular processes and functions is frequently associated

with enhanced cellular stress; thus malignant cells have
to adapt to this phenotype, becoming dependent on
a number of non-oncogenic functions to survive [7].
Several metabolic alterations of cancer cells such as
their dependence on glutamine, glycine or serine might
be considered as non-oncogenic addiction. Similarly, a
dependency associated with ROS homeostasis has been
shown to constitute a selective liability of malignant cells
(as opposed to non-transformed cells) also in xenograft
tumor models [35]. Identifying such dependencies
represent a promising alternative for the development of
new therapeutic strategies that by successfully targeting
metabolic enzymes minimize adverse effects on normal
tissues. Interestingly, the effects here described were
observed in cancer cells but not in normal immortalized
IOSE-hTERT cells, indicating that cancer cells only are
dependent on Chok-α expression to maintain the ROS
homeostasis. Indeed, we previously showed increased
expression and activity of Chok-α in EOC cell lines and
tumors as compared to the normal counterpart [20, 22]
and glutathione levels have been reported to be higher
in ovarian tumors than in normal ovarian tissue [36, 37].
Therefore CHKA targeting is expected to selectively affect
EOC cells while sparing normal cells. The enhancement
of cisplatin sensitivity upon CHKA knockdown in tumor
cells might open promising clinical perspectives providing
a chance for increasing the treatment efficacy by allowing
reduction of the dose of administered drugs and limiting
unwanted effects on normal cells.
Along this line, emerging technologies such as
the use of biocompatible nanoparticles for systemic
therapeutic gene silencing using RNA interference, offer
new opportunities for targeting even those molecules
otherwise undruggable.

Transient CHKA silencing
CHKA silencing was performed using a specific
siGENOME Smart Pool small interfering RNA (siRNA)
targeting a sequence of CHKA gene different from the
one recognized by the shRNA. A non targeting siRNA
was used as control (Thermo Scientific, Dharmacon
Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Transfection was carried out as
described [23]. Specificity of silencing effects was verified
using the QIAGEN siRNA pool targeting CHKA. Details
are reported in Supplementary Materials.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
Analyses were performed as described [20, 22] and
a brief description is reported in Supplementary Materials.

Enzymatic ChoK activity
H and 31P NMR assays were performed upon
addition of exogenous choline chloride, ATP and Mg++
ions to cytosolic cell preparations in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, as
described [20, 38].

Western blotting; qRT-PCR; cell migration and
cell invasion assays; drug sensitivity assays
For these assays, methods were essentially
as described [23] and are described in details in
Supplementary Materials with the list of specific
antibodies, probes and reagents used.

Materials and Methods

Growth and colony formation assay

Cell lines

Cells (100.000/well) were seeded in triplicates
on 12-well plates. After transfection cell growth was
assessed at each time-point by Trypan Blue exclusion
assay using Countess automated cell counter (Invitrogen).
Cell viability was evaluated as percentage of live cells
in the total cell population. For colony formation assay,
5.000 cells were plated in 6 well plates and grown 10
days. Colonies were fixed with 10% (v/v) methanol for
10min at -20°C, stained with 0.5% Crystal violet solution
(made in 25% methanol) for 10min at room temperature
and washed with ddH2O for colony visualisation. Colonies
were quantified using Odyssey Infrared laser scanner (LiCor Biosciences, NE, USA) at Infrared wavelength of 700
nm.

The following cell lines were used: INTOV11,
obtained in our laboratory from a serous high-grade EOC
[23], SKOV3, IGROV1, OVCAR5 (serous high-grade
EOC) and A2774 (endometrioid histotype) obtained from
ATCC; I64-hTERT normal ovary cell (IOSE-h-TERT)
lines immortalized with hTERT obtained in our laboratory
as described [20, 23]. For their relative maintenance and
genotypic characterization see Supplementary Materials.

Stable CHKA silencing
Strategy for cloning, generation and validation
of stable cell lines expressing shRNA against CHKA
and empty vector were as previously described [28].

reader (Tecan Group, Mannedorf/Zurich, Switzerland).
GSH/GSSG ratios are calculated from RLU measurements
after interpolation of glutathione concentrations from
standard curves.

For both INTOV11 and SKOV3 cellular models,
3x106 ΔLuc-sh-RNA and CHKA-sh-RNA -transduced
cells were injected sub-cutaneously into 8 weeks-old
female CD1 Nu/Nu mice (Charles River Laboratories)
acclimatized for at least one week before tumor cell
injection. Five animals/groups were used and monitored
for up to 30 days from injection. Tumors were measured
with a caliper and volume was calculated according to the

Glutathione depletion and loading
Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; Sigma Aldrich;
St Louis, MO, USA), an inhibitor of gammaglutamylcysteine synthetase [40], was used for GSH
depletion. 7,5x103 cells/well were seeded in 96 well plates
pre-incubated with or without 100 µM of BSO for 24
hours in FCS-free medium and then treated with cisplatin
or doxorubicin and cytotoxicity was evaluated after 48h
from medium replacement as above described. Glutathione
mono-ethyl ester (L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycyl
ethyl ester) (GEE; Sigma Aldrich; St Louis, MO, USA),
a membrane/lipid permeable derivative of GSH [41, 42],
was used for glutathione reloading experiments. To verify
the efficacy of GSH reloading, 1x104 cells/well were
seeded in 96 well plate, pre-incubated with or without
10 µM of GEE for 8 hours and then processed for GSH/
GSSG quantification according to kit’s instructions. To
verify the effects on drug sensitivity, 7,5x103 cells/well
were seeded in 96 well plates and pre-incubated with or
without 10 µM of GEE for 1 hour followed by exposure
to drugs for 7 hours; sensitivity to drugs was evaluated 48
hours later as above described.

.
following formula: volume (mm3) =
(D= major
nodule diameter; d= minor nodule diameter). The mice at
the end of the xenograft growth experiments were sacrified
upon induction of surgical anesthesia with ketamine/
xylazine. All protocols were approved by the Ethics
Committee for Animal Experimentation of the Fondazione
IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori and performed
according to institutional and the new Guidelines for the
Welfare and Use of Animals in Cancer Research (D.L.
116/92 and subsequent implementing circulars).

Metabolomic profiling
Metabolomic profiling analysis was performed
by Metabolon as previously described [39] analyzing
4 replicates of parental, ΔLuc-sh-RNA and sh-CHKA
transduced INTOV11 and SKOV3 cells collected 24
and 72 hours post seeding. Extracts from all samples
were analyzed on the gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid chromatography/
mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) platforms. Details on:
sample accessioning and preparation, GC/MS and LC/
MS/MS platforms, quality assurance data extraction and
compound identification are in Supplementary Material.
The present dataset comprises a total of 207 compounds
of known identity (biochemicals). Metabolon determined
global biochemical profiles of the samples and compared
them across treatment groups and cell lines to identify
biochemicals which differed significantly between
experimental groups within each cell line. Pathways were
assigned for each metabolite, allowing examination of
overrepresented pathways. All statistical analyses were
performed by Metabolon.

ROS detection
Intracellular accumulation of ROS was determined
under basal condition and after specific treatments (CHKA
silencing, drug treatment, GSH depletion/restoration)
using the oxidation sensitive fluorescent probe 5-(and-6)chloromethyl-2¢,7¢-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate,
acetyl ester (CM-H2DCF-DA) (Molecular Probes, Life
Technologies Milan, Italy). Cells were harvested by
trypsinization, washed and incubated for 45 min with 5
mM CMH2DCFDA and immediately analyzed by flow
cytometry. As positive control we used cells pretreated
with 150 µM H2O2 for 2hours and subsequently probed
with CMH2DCFDA. Samples were acquired with FACS
Canto (Becton - Dickinson) and the data processed using
Flow Jo 7.6.4 Analysis Software (Becton-Dickinson).

GSH/GSSG quantification

Statistical analysis

After 72 hours of CHKA transfection, 1x10^4 cell
were seeded in 96 well plate in FCS-free culture media
and after attachment, cells were lysed and processed for
the assay. Reduced and oxidized glutathione ratio was
measured using the luminescent GSH/GSSG-Glo assay
kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Luminescence was measured using an Ultra multiplate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism Software
Version 5 ( GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego). Statistical
significance was determined by one-way ANOVA or by
Student’s t-test, as specified. Differences were considered
significant at P < 0.05. Asterisks in all Figures denote a
statistically significant difference in comparison to the
