BACKGROUND: Despite recent improvements in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), adult patients
still have an overall poor outcome. The future of ALL management relies on the introduction of novel targeted therapies. The authors sought to assess if protein kinases (PKs), frequently deregulated in cancer, show an altered expression pattern and can be considered as suitable therapeutic targets in adult ALL. METHODS: The authors studied the
PK gene expression profile by oligonucleotide arrays in 133 adult ALL samples at the onset of the disease and subsequently performed in vitro experiments to evaluate the sensitivity to first- and second-generation PK inhibitors of a
set of ALL cell lines, as well as of primary ALL cells. RESULTS: The study documents a distinctive PK signature for different adult ALL subgroups; the PKs identified include several tyrosine kinase (TK) genes, especially in E2A/PBXþ Blineage ALL (B-ALL), B-ALL without known molecular abnormalities, and T-lineage ALL. Consistently, cell lines and
primary samples belonging to these groups proved susceptible to TK inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that second-generation TK inhibitors may be effective in ALL subsets other than BCR/ABLþ B-ALL and provide
the rationale for testing the impact of the newly developed TK inhibitors in the management of adult ALL patients.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represents a biologically and clinically heterogeneous entity with different

genetic profiles, and variable clinical features and outcome.1,2 B-Lineage ALL (B-ALL) accounts for 70% to 80% of
ALLs3; cytogenetic abnormalities are very common, the most frequent being t(9;22) occurring in roughly 25% of adults
and increasing in the elderly.4 Less frequent aberrations include t(4;11) and t(1;19), associated with ALL1/AF4 and E2A/
PBX rearrangements, respectively. t(9;22) and t(4;11) are associated with a poor outcome, whereas the prognostic impact
of t(1;19) is still debated.5-8 About 50% of cases do not harbor any known fusion transcript.1,3
T-Lineage ALL (T-ALL) has a lower incidence in both adults and children, accounting for about 20% to 25% of
cases; structural chromosomal alterations are detected in 50% of T-ALL, the most frequent involving the T-cell receptor
(TCR) loci. Other translocations, often cryptic, result in the formation of fusion genes as SIL/TAL1, CALM/AF10,
NUP214/ABL1, and EML1/ABL1.9 Moreover, a deregulated expression of T-cell oncogenes is frequently documented.10
Although great improvements have been achieved in the treatment of childhood ALL, adult patients still have a poor
prognosis, with a cure rate rarely exceeding 40%3; thus, valid alternatives to current therapies are required. Protein kinases
(PKs) play a fundamental role in signal transduction pathways; a PK deregulation, broadly described in cancer, might contribute to tumor development and progression.11,12 Over the past years, the number of kinase-targeted drug therapies

undergoing clinical investigation has increased exponentially.13,14 Several kinases have been validated as targets in
hematological malignancies, such as ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)15-17 and in BCR/ABLþ ALL
patients18,19 and FLT3 in acute myeloid leukemia
cases20,21; other PKs might represent potential therapeutic
targets.22-24
To assess if ALL leukemic samples from adult ALL
show an altered PK gene pattern and are affected by tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors, we performed gene expression
profiling and in vitro functional experiments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients’ Samples
One hundred thirty-three bone marrow (BM) primary
samples from adult patients with newly diagnosed ALL
were used for gene expression studies. Patients provided
their written informed consent to BM collection for diagnostic and research purposes according to the Declaration
of Helsinki. The study was approved by the institutional
review board of the Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome.
Patients were enrolled in 4 consecutive GIMEMA
(Gruppo Italiano Malattie EMatologiche dell’Adulto)
Italian multicenter clinical trials. After density gradient
separation, mononuclear cells were cryopreserved or immediately processed for RNA extraction. All samples
evaluated contained 80% leukemic cells. Immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular features were evaluated according to the protocol guidelines, as described.25
Molecular screening analysis was performed according to
the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
multiplex protocol described by Elia et al.26 Fifteen additional adult ALL patients were used for in vitro
experiments.
Oligonucleotide Microarray and
Statistical Analysis
Total RNA (2-8 lg), extracted using the RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for gene expression
profiling experiments. Eleven lg RNA were fragmented
and hybridized to HGU133 Plus 2.0 gene chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif), as described.27
Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed
using the dChip software (www.dchip.org),28 which uses
an invariant set normalization method, where the array
with median overall intensity is chosen as the baseline for
normalization. Model-based expressions were computed

for each array and probe set using only perfect match
probes.
To concentrate on PKs, unsupervised and supervised analyses were based on a list of 1324 probe sets (505
genes) coding for PKs, as from Affymetrix annotations
(www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx).
Unsupervised clustering was performed as described
by Eisen et al,29 and the distance between 2 genes was
computed as 1 minus the correlation between the standardized expression values across samples.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with P value .001
was performed to compare the 5 major ALL subgroups,
namely T-ALL, E2A/PBXþ, ALL1/AF4þ, BCR/ABLþ,
and cases without any known molecular abnormalities
(defined throughout the text as B-NEG); we retained
probe sets with a mean expression value 300 in at least 1
group and a fold change difference 1.5 in a group compared with every other. It is worth noting that these criteria were more stringent than those previously used by our
group.30
To further investigate the B-NEG group, 3 t tests
were performed comparing these patients with every other
B-ALL subgroup. Genes were required to have an average
expression value 300 in at least 1 group, a fold change
difference 1.5, and a P value .05.
Real-time Quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was performed on 5 T-ALL,
5 BCR/ABLþ, 5 B-NEG, 4 ALL1/AF4þ, and 3 E2A/
PBXþ samples on 13 genes resulting from ANOVA that
had a P value <E10. Primers were designed using Primer
Express 1.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
Calif) (Table 1). The ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence
Detection System and the SYBR green dye (Applied Biosystems) were applied as previously described.30 Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cycle
threshold (CT) values were used for normalization purposes. For each gene, expression levels were computed as
the difference (DCT) between the target gene CT and
GAPDH CT. Lower DCT correspond to higher expression
values.
Box plots were generated using the StatCrunch software (www.statcrunch.com), and the correlation between
gene expression and Q-PCR results was calculated using
the Pearson coefficient.
Cell Lines and Cell Cultures
In vitro experiments were performed on ALL cell lines
harboring the ALL1/AF4 and E2A/PBX transcripts—

namely RS4;11 and RCH-ACV—and on the Jurkat Tcell line (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). The ALL cell
line SUP-B15, harboring the BCR/ABL rearrangement,
was used as positive control. The Jurkat and RCH-ACV
cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Hyclone,
South Logan, Utah) supplemented with heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 0.3 mg/mL L-glutamine (EuroClone, Milan, Italy), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (EuroClone) at 37 C in a humidified 5% CO2
atmosphere. The RS4;11 cell line was grown in Iscove medium (Eurobio, Courtaboeuf, France) supplemented with
20% FBS, and the SUP-B15 was grown in McCoy 5A
medium (HyClone) supplemented with 10% FBS. No
growth factors or cytokines were added to the culture. To
test the sensitivity of the cell lines to TK inhibitors, imatinib mesylate (STI-571, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) and
dasatinib (BMS-354825, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) were used.
Cell Line Proliferation and MTT Assays
To evaluate the effects of TK inhibitors on cell line proliferation, 2 methods were used: the first based on (3H)-thy-

3428

midine incorporation by the proliferating cells and the
other based on the reduction of the yellow tetrazolium
MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) salt by metabolically active cells. To perform the (3H)-thymidine incorporation assay, cells (1 
104/100 lL) were cultured in a 96-well plate and treated
with increasing doses of imatinib or dasatinib, ranging
from 0.01 to 100 lM. Imatinib and dasatinib were given
exclusively at time 0, and proliferation was measured after
24, 48, 72, and 96 hours, when 1 lCi of (3H)-thymidine
was added. After an overnight incubation, cells were harvested, and radioactivity measured using a beta-counter
(Packard Bioscience, Groningen, the Netherlands).
Results are given in counts per minute (cpm). Each condition was run in triplicate.
The MTT assay (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, Mo) was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells (2  104/100 lL) were seeded in a 96-well plate and
exposed to the aforementioned concentrations of imatinib
or dasatinib; also in this assay, drugs were added only at
time 0. The cell activity rate was evaluated quantifying the
tetrazolium products after 48 and 72 hours of treatment

calculated as the mean of cpm/OD triplicates of treated
wells divided by the mean cpm/OD triplicates of control
untreated wells, multiplied by 100%.
Cultures of Primary ALL Cells and MTT Assays
Freshly isolated ALL samples were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Hyclone) supplemented with heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone), 0.3 mg/mL L-glutamine (EuroClone), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (EuroClone) at
37 C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The medium
was not supplemented with additional growth factors.
Sensitivity to imatinib and dasatinib was determined
only by the MTT assay, given the low proliferation rate of
primary cells. Cells (1  105/100 lL) were seeded in 96well plates and incubated with escalating doses (0.001100 lM) of TK inhibitors, administered only at time 0.
Cell viability was assessed after 72 and 96 hours as
described above.

RESULTS
Patients’ Characteristics
The median age of the patients included in the gene
expression profiling study was 36 years; 56 were women,
and 77 were men. Immunophenotypic analysis assigned
91 samples to B-lineage and 42 to T-lineage. Forty B-ALL
samples carried the BCR/ABL rearrangement, 5 carried
the ALL1/AF4 fusion gene, and 3 were E2A/PBXþ. Fortythree samples did not harbor any known molecular
abnormality.
Among T-ALL cases, molecular analysis revealed a
BCR/ABL rearrangement in 2 samples and NUP214/
ABL1 in 1; 5 cases were SIL/TALþ and 1 carried the
ALL1/ENLl fusion transcript.
Patient’s characteristics are summarized in Table 2.

Gene Expression Profiling Identifies Specific
PKs for Each ALL Subgroup
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on the PK
gene list containing 1324 probe sets grouped the majority
of T-ALL cases in a unique cluster, whereas the B-ALL
patients harboring specific molecular abnormalities were
intermingled (Fig. 1).
To highlight distinctive PKs within each ALL subgroup, an ANOVA was performed; 170 genes were
selected (Fig. 2). Among the genes with a mean expression
value 300 in at least 1 group, 78 were highly expressed
in T-ALL and in the E2A/PBXþ group, 80 in the ALL1/
AF4þ group, 77 in the BCR/ABLþ group, and 74 in the
B-NEG group.

Figure 2. Gene expression profile based on 170 protein kinases identified by analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown. B-NEG indicates no known molecular abnormalities; T-ALL, T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

A fold change criterion was subsequently used; 17
and 15 PK genes were highly specific for the T-ALL and
E2A/PBXþ cases, respectively, and 12 genes were specific
for the ALL1/AF4þ patients. In contrast, the BCR/ABLþ
group was characterized by a specific expression of only 7
PK genes, and the B-NEG group had a single gene; this is
consistent with the high heterogeneity of this group.30 TALL samples were characterized by the high expression of
EPHB6, LCK, ITK, FGFR1, RYK, and ZAP-70. The E2A/
PBXþ group showed the homogeneous overexpression of
MERTK, BLK, and TNK2. Moreover, in line with our
previous results,30,31 these samples exerted high levels of
ZAP-70 and LCK, although the highest levels were distinctive of T-ALL cases. FLT3, ILK, and LTK were specifically highly expressed in ALL1/AF4þ cases. Apart from
ABL1, the BCR/ABLþ group was characterized by the
high expression levels of FYN. The complete list of
selected PKs is provided in Table 3.
Thus, distinctive PKs were identified for each ALL
subgroup, except the B-NEG samples.

Comparative Analysis of B-NEG Group With
Other B-ALL Subgroups
To identify additional PKs highly expressed in the BNEG cases, we compared this group with every other

3430

B-ALL subset using a t test. The comparison between the
B-NEG and E2A/PBXþ groups identified 70 genes (Fig.
3A). Fifty-two genes were differentially expressed between
the B-NEG and ALL1/AF4þ groups (Fig. 3B). Only 27
genes were differentially expressed between the B-NEG
and BCR/ABLþ groups (Fig. 3C). Fourteen genes, including FYN, RYK, FLT1, and FGFR1, were more highly
expressed in the B-NEG group when compared with both
E2A/PBXþ and ALL1/AF4þ cases.
Moreover, HCK and FLT3 were overexpressed in
the B-NEG group in comparison with the E2A/PBXþ
and BCR/ABLþ groups (Table 4).

Validation of Results in an Independent
Test Set
To further validate these results, we compared this analysis with the data obtained in a prior set of B-ALL samples30; ZAP-70, LCK, ALK, BLK, MERTK, STK39, and
KIAA0175, previously found overexpressed in the E2A/
PBXþ group, were also detected in the present analysis.
Similarly, we could confirm the overexpression of FLT3
and MAP3K5 in the ALL1/AF4þ samples. Furthermore,
the present analysis corroborated the overexpression of
FLT3, FLT1, RYK, FGFR1, and FYN in the B-NEG
group.

the lowest DCT values in the ALL1/AF4þ samples, followed by the B-NEG cases (Fig. 4C). In addition to
ABL1, CRIM1 was more highly expressed in the BCR/
ABLþ cases (Fig. 4D).
There was a significant correlation between the QPCR and microarray values; because low CT values correspond to high microarray gene expression levels, a negative correlation was found.

Figure 3. Identification is shown of protein kinases differentially expressed between the no known molecular abnormalities (B-NEG) and the other B-lineage acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) subgroups by t test.

Q-PCR Analysis
To validate the microarray results, Q-PCR was performed
on 13 genes (Table 1).
ZAP-70, LCK, CAMK4, ITK, PRKCQ, and RYK
showed the lowest DCT in the T-ALL group; MERTK,
PRKCZ, and STK38 DCT was low in the E2A/PBXþ
group (Fig. 4A, B). FLT3, together with LTK, displayed

Effects of TK Inhibitors on Cell Line
Proliferation and Viability
ALL cell lines were exposed to increasing doses of TK
inhibitors, and their effects on proliferation and viability
were examined by (3H)-thymidine assay incorporation
and the MTT assay. The intermediate dose of 1 lM was
regarded as ideal to compare cell line responses. As
expected, after 72 hours treatment with 1 lM dasatinib,
the proliferation rate and viability of the SUP-B15 cells
were decreased to 23% and 12%, respectively. The RCHACV cells showed a comparable response; in fact, the percentage of proliferating cells was reduced to 19%, and the
viability decreased to 33%. Dasatinib proved moderately
effective in modulating the Jurkat proliferation and viability, because both decreased to roughly 50%. In contrast,
when exposed to 1 lM dasatinib for 72 hours, the RS4;11
cells proved barely sensitive (Fig. 5A).
Dasatinib effects were compared with those achieved
by imatinib. Although SUP-B15 proliferation was moderately inhibited by imatinib, only 36% of cells remained
viable after 72 hours imatinib treatment. The Jurkat cell
line was somewhat affected by imatinib exposure, with a
45% reduction in proliferating cells and an even lower
decrease of 40% in viability. Furthermore, the RCHACV and RS4;11 cell lines proved insensitive to imatinib
(Fig. 5B); similar results were observed also at higher concentrations. Overall, these results suggest that dasatinib is
more effective than imatinib in affecting the viability of
various ALL cell lines and displays a higher antiproliferative effect.
Effects of TK Inhibitors on Primary
Cell Viability
The effects of TK inhibitors were also evaluated using the
MTT assay on primary cells from 15 patients, including
12 B-ALL and 3 T-ALL. Among the B-ALL patients, 7
carried the BCR/ABL fusion transcript, and 1 carried the
ALL1/AF4 transcript, whereas 4 cases did not carry any
molecular rearrangement (B-NEG).

Although a response was already observed at 72
hours, the greatest effects on primary cells were observed
at 96 hours, in line with the lower metabolic activity of
primary cells compared with cell lines. As expected, BCR/
ABLþ primary cells proved highly sensitive to dasatinib.
In fact, when treated with dasatinib 1 lM, only 34% of
cells on average remained viable; to a lesser extent, consistent with the results obtained from gene expression profiling and cell lines, the viability of T-ALL and B-NEG
samples was considerably reduced (60% and 46% viable
cells on average, respectively). In contrast, primary cells
from the single ALL1/AF4þ patient were not affected by
dasatinib exposure (Fig. 6). In line with this, a dose
response effect of dasatinib was recorded in BCR/ABLþ,
T-ALL, and B-NEG cases, whereas an effect on ALL1/
AF4þ primary cells was observed only at very high concentrations (Fig. 7). Imatinib showed a marked activity
only on BCR/ABLþ samples (Fig. 6). Therefore, in vitro
experiments on primary cells corroborated the results
observed on cell lines.

DISCUSSION
Treatment of adult ALL may improve through the identification of molecules or cellular pathways that enhance
growth, cell survival, and proliferation, which might be
blocked by specific inhibitors. To evaluate if PKs, particuCancer

July 15, 2010

larly TKs and receptor TKs (RTKs), could be considered
as potential therapeutic targets in adult ALL patients, we
examined their expression levels in 133 patients at the
onset of disease. Different ALL subgroups showed specific
PK gene expression patterns. The T-ALL group showed
the highest number of specific TKs; among these, ZAP70, LCK, and ITK play an important role in TCR
signaling.
In the E2A/PBXþ B-ALL group, BLK, MERTK,
and TNK2 satisfied the selection criteria; BLK is a Src
family kinase involved in the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway,32 and MERTK belongs to the RTK family,33
whereas TNK2, a nonreceptor TK involved in intracellular signal transduction, has a role in tumorigenesis.34
Pro-B ALL cases carrying the ALL1/AF4 rearrangement were characterized by a high expression level of ILK
and LTK; furthermore, the analysis confirmed the high
levels of expression of FLT3, a RTK involved in leukemogenesis and consistently reported to be highly expressed in
this ALL subset.30,35,36
In addition to ABL1, the BCR/ABLþ group showed
an up-regulation of RPL4 and FYN; the latter among the
first signaling molecules downstream of the TCR and is
also involved in BCR-induced signal transduction.37,38
Given the high heterogeneity of B-NEG cases,30,39
no TKs were specifically expressed in this group. However,

some TKs and several RTKs were expressed at high levels in
these patients: among these, HCK, FYN, and FLT3 appear
to contribute to leukemogenesis.35,38,40-42
Overall, these data indicate that in several hematologic settings other than CML and BCR/ABLþ ALL, TKs

might be of considerable interest for targeted intervention. To test this hypothesis, we carried out in vitro
experiments exposing ALL cell lines, as well as primary
ALL cells, to TK inhibitors. At present, 3 inhibitors have
been widely tested clinically, the milestone being imatinib, an inhibitor targeting the inactive form of BCR/ABL
that has dramatically improved the outcome of CML
patients and has a primary role also in BCR/ABLþ
ALL.15-19,43 Second-generation inhibitors include nilotinib (AMN107, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), which is
highly specific for the inactive form of BCR/ABL and has
proven to be more potent than imatinib,44-47 and dasatinib, which simultaneously inhibits ABL1 and a wide spectrum of TKs, especially Src family kinases.48,49 These
molecules have achieved highly encouraging results in
clinical trials.46,50,51 Imatinib and dasatinib were chosen
to perform in vitro experiments to compare the effect of a
specific first-generation TK inhibitor with that of a multitarget second-generation inhibitor. In vitro experiments
showed that, in addition to the BCR/ABLþ cell line, the
T-ALL cell line and the B-ALL line carrying the E2A/PBX
transcript were sensitive to dasatinib. Consistently, when
exposed to dasatinib, primary cells from patients with TALL showed reduced viability. We did not test TK inhibitors on primary cells from any E2A/PBXþ primary sample, given its low incidence.7 However, E2A/PBXþ
patients are likely to be sensitive to a second-generation
TK inhibitor in view of the high levels of expression of
several TKs and the results achieved in the RCH-ACV
cells. The ALL1/AF4þ cell line and primary cells were
barely affected by dasatinib treatment. Moreover, we
observed that dasatinib was capable of impairing the via-

bility of primary cells from B-NEG patients. This finding
is in agreement with the gene expression profiling data
highlighting a similarity between BCR/ABLþ ALL and
ALL with B-NEG profiles30,39; furthermore, in vitro
experiments point to a potential role of dasatinib in the
management of such patients.
Overall, the in vitro functional experiments confirmed that ALL samples from subgroups with a significant overexpression of several TKs were sensitive to
dasatinib. The finding that B-NEG, E2A/PBXþ, and TALL subsets were responsive to dasatinib could be sustained by the overexpression of several TKs and Src family
kinases, namely BLK, FYN, HCK, and LCK, being a target
of dasatinib.48 At variance, no Src family kinases were distinctive of ALL1/AF4þ cases; thus, it is not unexpected
that the effects of dasatinib were irrelevant in this subgroup of patients.
In conclusion, in the present study we could document that dasatinib has a remarkable effect on several ALL
subgroups, whereas imatinib is active only in the BCR/
ABLþ cases. This is not surprising, because imatinib specifically targets the leukemogenic event occurring in BCR/
ABLþ ALL, that is, the constitutive ABL1 activation.52 In
contrast, in the other subgroups of ALL there are no evidences that any TKs are pathogenic. Nevertheless, TK
overexpression may sustain leukemic cells survival,
because viability is impaired when a multitarget TK inhibitor is used. We propose that dasatinib, as well as newly
developed TK inhibitors, may be effective in the management of ALL subtypes; given that the percentage of viability reduction is in the range of about 50%, a combination
approach should be considered.
