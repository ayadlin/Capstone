BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is associated with poor survival. This study compared the outcomes of
patients with unresectable ICC treated with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) plus systemic chemotherapy (SYS) with the outcomes of
patients treated with SYS alone. METHODS: Consecutive patients with ICC were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicopathologic data
were reviewed. Survival rates were compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank testing. RESULTS: Between January 2000 and
August 2012, 525 patients with ICC were evaluated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and 236 patients with unresectable
tumors (locally advanced or metastatic) were analyzed. Disease was confined to the liver in 104 patients, who underwent treatment
with combined HAI and SYS (n 5 78 or 75%) or SYS alone (n 5 26 or 25%). The response rate in the combined group was better than
the rate in the group receiving SYS alone, although this did not reach statistical significance (59% vs 39%, P 5.11). Overall survival for
the combined group was longer than overall survival for the patients who received SYS alone (30.8 vs 18.4 months, P <.001), and this
difference was maintained when patients with portal lymph node disease were included in the survival analysis (29.6 months with
HAI and SYS [n 5 93] vs 15.9 months with SYS [n 5 74], P <.001). Eight patients who initially presented with unresectable tumors responded
enough to undergo complete resection and had a median overall survival of 37 months (range, 10.4-92.3 months). CONCLUSIONS: In
patients with unresectable ICC confined to the liver or with limited regional nodal disease, a combination of SYS and HAI chemotherC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common primary liver cancer and is increasing in incidence.1
Unresectable ICC is associated with a median survival of less than 5 months without treatment2 and approximately 1 year
with contemporary systemic chemotherapy (SYS).3 Patients who undergo resection with curative intent frequently develop a recurrence,4 and this results in a median survival ranging from 27 to 36 months.4,5 The ABC (Advanced Biliary
Cancer)-02 phase 3 trial established the current standard of SYS in advanced biliary cancer but showed only a modest survival benefit in patients treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin (11.7 months) versus gemcitabine monotherapy (8.1
months).3 More effective nonoperative therapies are, therefore, necessary if improvements in outcome are to be realized.
Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy represents a locoregional approach that administers a continuous
infusion of a drug directly into the liver and thereby allows much greater drug delivery to the tumor without increasing systemic toxicity.6 Other hepatic artery–based treatment modalities that are being used for unresectable ICC include transarterial chemoembolization and radioembolization with yttrium-90.7,8
The greatest experience with HAI has been in patients with colorectal liver metastases, particularly those with
advanced disease. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of HAI in both adjuvant and unresectable disease settings,
with significantly higher response rates, less toxicity, and, in some cases, a potential survival benefit in comparison with

SYS alone.9-17 In contrast, experience with HAI in primary liver cancer is much more limited. Studies in
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma have suggested efficacy and a potential survival benefit for patients who
respond to a combination of SYS and HAI.18,19 The existing experience with ICC has been limited to small phase 1
and 2 trials using a variety of agents with promising
results.20-22 The authors have previously published their
experience with HAI floxuridine (FUDR) monotherapy
and FUDR in combination with bevacizumab in unresectable primary liver cancer in 2 phase 2 clinical trials
with encouraging response rates and a median survival of
approximately 30 months23,24; however, large, prospective trials comparing HAI with SYS to SYS alone have not
been performed.
The aims of the current study were to compare the
response and survival with SYS and combined HAI and
SYS in patients with unresectable ICC. This study is a retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients with
unresectable ICC treated with SYS with or without HAI
over a 12-year period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Tumors

This study was approved by the institutional review board
and was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act–compliant. Prospectively maintained databases in the
Department of Surgery were queried to identify patients
with ICC who were referred for surgical evaluation; an
institutional database was also queried for patients with
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis code 155.1 (malignant neoplasm of intrahepatic bile
ducts) to identify all ICC patients referred for nonsurgical
therapy. The study included only patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of ICC that was not amenable to
resection at initial presentation, as determined by attending
hepatobiliary surgeons. Unresectable disease included distant metastases, nonreconstructable vascular involvement,
or severe underlying liver parenchymal disease. Patients
with multifocal tumors and extensive regional nodal disease
were, in general, considered unresectable because of the
poor prognosis associated with these findings. Satellite
lesions were defined as ICC nodules separate from the
main tumor mass. Patients subjected to resection, patients
not treated with chemotherapy or treated elsewhere, and
patients with missing treatment and/or outcome data were
excluded from this study.
The majority of the patients initially considered candidates for resection or HAI pump placement underwent

surgical exploration, and their staging was derived from
the operative findings. Patients who were not explored
were staged on the basis of imaging. Evidence of extrahepatic disease in the initial imaging (nodal disease and distant metastases) was reviewed in subsequent scans for the
purpose of this study, and evidence of radiologic progression was used to confirm the presence of disease.
Patients with unresectable disease were referred for
treatment with chemotherapy, either SYS alone or a combination of SYS and HAI, according to the extent of disease and at the discretion of the treating medical
oncologist. The indications for HAI chemotherapy in
patients with ICC and the technique of HAI pump placement have been published previously.23,24 Briefly,
patients were considered for HAI placement if they had
liver-confined disease with < 70% of the liver involved.
Exclusion criteria included prior hepatic radiation or
treatment with FUDR, a Karnofsky performance status< 60, first-degree sclerosing cholangitis, Gilbert’s disease,
portal hypertension, severe hepatic parenchymal dysfunction (encephalopathy, serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL, serum
bilirubin  1.8 mg/dL, or international normalized ratio
>1.5), portal inflow occlusion, a white blood cell
count < 3500 cells/mm3, concurrent malignancy (except
for localized basal or squamous cell skin cancers), active
infection, and concurrent pregnancy or lactation
(females). Forty-four patients who received HAI were part
of 2 previously reported clinical trials.23,24 The first trial
reported 34 unresectable patients with primary liver cancer (26 with ICC) and investigated the use of dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for the
assessment of tumor vascularity as a biomarker of outcome. The second trial reported 22 unresectable patients
with primary liver cancer (18 with ICC) and investigated
the safety and efficacy of adding systemic (intravenous)
bevacizumab to HAI. HAI therapy was typically reserved
for patients with disease confined to the liver or select
patients with limited regional lymph node disease (ie,
porta hepatis), which was often identified at the time of
exploration. SYS without HAI was the treatment of choice
for all patients with lymph node disease beyond the porta
hepatis (ie, celiac and para-aortic).
HAI chemotherapy consisted of a continuous infusion of FUDR into the hepatic arterial circulation that
was administered through a surgically implanted pump at
a predetermined flow rate.23 Pump chemotherapy treatment generally began 2 weeks after pump placement, with
each cycle consisting of 2 weeks of continuous FUDR
infusion followed by 2 weeks of heparin and saline; concurrent SYS was typically delivered during this latter 2759

week period. In the face of disease progression in the liver,
select patients received sideport injections of mitomycin
C or gemcitabine. The administration of HAI and SYS
chemotherapy has been described in several prior publications.23-25 A variety of systemic regimens were used in
combination with HAI. For patients treated with SYS
alone, gemcitabine-based combination therapy was used
most often, although several different agents were ultimately employed.
After the onset of treatment, patients were followed
at approximately 3-month intervals with computerized
tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
Magnetic resonance imaging scans and positron emission
tomography scans were obtained during treatment to
investigate specific findings as necessary. The response to
therapy was assessed with Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.26 When disease progression
was evident, the treatment regimen was changed or new
agents were added according to the specific findings.23,24
Liver disease progression for a patient on HAI led to the
addition of an SYS agent and/or another HAI agent via
sideport injection. Extrahepatic progression was treated
with the addition or modification of the SYS regimen
according to the disease response.
Treatment with SYS and/or HAI continued until one
of the following conditions was observed: liver disease progression, extrahepatic progression, treatment-related toxicity/complications, or completion of surgical resection.
Toxicity during chemotherapy was graded according to the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria
3.0. With respect to biliary toxicity, liver function tests
were routinely evaluated during each HAI cycle. Dose
modifications of FUDR were calculated according to the
changes in liver function tests. Hepatic toxicity from treatment was defined as a significant increase in comparison
with individual pretreatment values (2-fold or greater for
alkaline phosphatase, 3-fold or greater for aspartate aminotransferase, and 1.5-fold or greater for bilirubin) that led to
a dose reduction, as described previously.27 Our experience
with biliary toxicity related to HAI in combination with
bevacizumab has been reported previously.24,28
Outcomes Measures and Statistical Analysis

Responses based on RECIST and overall survival were analyzed in patients stratified by treatment (HAI and SYS vs
SYS alone) and disease extent (liver only with or without
regional nodal disease); patients with distant metastatic
disease were included in the survival analysis for comparison. The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS
14.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Ill). The Student t test and the
760

Mann-Whitney test were used to compare continuous
variables, and the chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test
were used to compare categorical variables as appropriate.
Overall survival was measured from the date of the first
histological diagnosis until death or last follow-up. Progression-free survival was measured from the date of treatment initiation until first documented progression, death,
or last follow-up. Survival rates were estimated with the
Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to
assess differences between survival curves. A P value less
than .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
Clinicopathologic Characteristics

Between January 2000 and August 2012, 525 patients
with biopsy-confirmed ICC were evaluated at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. After the exclusion of
patients who underwent resection (n 5 138) and patients
who received treatment elsewhere without sufficient data
(n 5 151), 236 patients with unresectable ICC had complete clinicopathologic, chemotherapy, and survival data
available. Among these patients, 167 had disease confined
to the liver and/or regional lymph nodes, and they represent the focus of this study; the remaining 69 patients had
distant metastases.
The characteristics of the 167 patients without distant disease are summarized in Table 1. The median age
of all patients was 62 years (range, 30-88 years), and the
majority (59%) were female. The most frequent presentation was abdominal pain (43%). The median radiologic
tumor size was 8.5 cm (range, 1.5-16.4 cm); most tumors
involved both liver lobes (74%), were multifocal (63.5%),
and were moderately differentiated (67%). The majority
of the included patients (n 5 117 or 70%) had unresectable disease at exploration, and 93 of these patients (56%)
underwent HAI pump placement. Overall, 104 patients
(62%) had disease confined to the liver (ie, without nodal
disease) but were not candidates for resection because of
locally advanced and/or multifocal tumors, whereas 63
(38%) were found to have nodal disease.
At the time of the analysis, the majority of the 236
patients (79%) were dead of disease. The median overall
survival for the study cohort was 20.1 months (range, 1.3120.3 months). Patients with liver-only disease (24.1
months; range, 4-120.3 months) experienced better survival than patients with nodal disease (17.1 months;
range, 1.4-58.9 months) or distant metastases (12.4
months; range, 1.3-59.2 months), regardless of treatment
(P < .001; Fig. 1).

both SYS and HAI; 6 patients (2.5%) received only HAI
because they did not tolerate SYS but were included in the

(76%).
Table 2 outlines the chemotherapy agents administered to the 167 patients with disease confined to the liver

study. In total, 93 patients received HAI (56%). FUDR
was used in all of these patients, with mitomycin C added
for 38%; gemcitabine-based HAI was used in 3%. The
most common SYS agent used in combination with HAI
was a gemcitabine-based regimen (86%); irinotecan- and
5-fluoruracil–based regimens were used in 67% and 54%
of the patients, respectively. Forty-four patients were
treated in the setting of 2 clinical trials (26 with FUDR
monotherapy and 18 with FUDR plus bevacizumab).
In patients who received only SYS therapy, 78%
were administered gemcitabine-based regimens as the first
line, and 65% were administered 5-fluoruracil regimens
as the second line. Among the patients who received only
SYS therapy, 85% received gemcitabine-based chemotherapy at some point in their treatment; the vast majority
received either gemcitabine and cisplatin (30%) or
another gemcitabine-based multiagent therapy (43%)
such as gemcitabine and oxaliplatin.

clinicopathologic characteristics of these patients. All
patients who were treated with HAI underwent surgical
exploration, whereas 11 of the patients (42%) treated
with SYS alone were also surgically explored.
Overall, patients who received only SYS had patient
and tumor characteristics similar to those of patients
treated with HAI and SYS. According to the available
chemotherapy response data (n 5 78 for HAI and n 5 18
for SYS), the response rate for patients who received HAI
and SYS was better than the rate for those who received
SYS alone. A partial response according to RECIST was
observed in 47 of 79 (59%) after HAI and SYS and in 7 of
18 (39%) after SYS (P 5 .11; Fig. 3).
Progression-free survival was better for the HAI and
SYS group, although this did not reach statistical significance (12 vs 7 months, P 5 .2). The combination of HAI
and SYS was associated with improved overall survival in
comparison with SYS alone (30.8 vs 18.4 months,

and SYS (n 5 78) were compared with those treated with

Patients Subjected to Resection After
Conversion Chemotherapy

In total, 8 patients who initially presented with unresectable tumors underwent resection with curative intent after
conversion chemotherapy. Four patients received SYS
only, and 4 received SYS and HAI (1 patient in the latter
group received HAI only). The median age of these
patients was 63.5 years (range, 41-80 years), and 4 were
female. Five of these patients (62%) were initially not candidates for resection because of liver-confined advanced
disease, and 3 were initially not candidates because of
nodal disease. The median time from the initial diagnosis
to resection was 11 months (range, 7-36 months), and the
median time from chemotherapy initiation to resection
was 10 months (range, 5.3-33.9 months). Seven of 8
resections were extended hepatectomies, and the resection
margins were negative in 5 patients; the median tumor
size was 6 cm (range, 4-9.5 cm), and 2 patients had confirmed metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes. Two
patients died perioperatively, and 5 patients experienced
recurrence within a year. The 2 patients with nodal disease
received only SYS. Two patients continued to have no

(range, 10.4-92.3 months).
DISCUSSION
ICC, albeit the second most common primary liver cancer, is a rare malignancy. It has been increasing in frequency and mortality,29 likely because of an increase in
established risk factors, such as hepatitis C virus and nonalcoholic liver disease, and because of more accurate recognition.30,31 Most of these tumors present at an
advanced unresectable stage with limited treatment
options, whereas even resectable disease frequently recurs
and is associated with limited survival.4,5 More effective
treatments are thus needed.
Currently, the gold standard for advanced biliary
tumors consists of a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin, which offers a modest survival advantage over
Cancer

gemcitabine monotherapy (11.7 vs 8.1 months, respectively).3 Other gemcitabine-based regimens, notably gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin, have shown similar efficacy.32
The large majority of SYS patients with disease confined
to the liver and regional lymph nodes in this study were
treated with gemcitabine (85%), which was part of combination therapy in 73%. The addition of biologic agents
such as cetuximab has failed so far to lead to improvements in the survival of these patients.33 Recent advancements in the knowledge of the biology of these tumors
and the identification of novel mutations are expected to
aid in the identification of new targeted therapies that
could potentially lead to improvements in survival.34,35
HAI chemotherapy represents a therapeutic
approach that combines the delivery of high doses of
chemotherapy directly to the arterial circulation where
tumors derive most of their supply and minimizes the systemic toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent. FUDR, a
pyrimidine antimetabolite transformed to 5-fluoruracil in
the liver, is the preferred agent at our institution because it
has an extraction rate of 94% to 99% in the liver during
the first pass; this leads to a high ratio of hepatic drug exposure to systemic drug exposure and minimizes systemic
toxicity.36 The use of HAI for the treatment of extensive
colorectal cancer liver metastases is associated with
improved responses, less toxicity, and a potential survival
benefit in comparison with SYS alone. The use of HAI in
ICC is limited to small clinical trials frequently combining
HAI with a variety of systemic agents.20-23 We previously
763

Original Article

reported 2 clinical trials investigating the use of FUDR first
alone and subsequently in combination with systemic bevacizumab for unresectable primary liver cancer, with the majority of the patients having cholangiocarcinomas.23,24 The
first trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of HAI for
ICC.23 The second trial concluded that the addition of bevacizumab to HAI with FUDR increased the biliary toxicity
without an improved outcome.24 In these trials, we
reported high response rates and a median survival of
approximately 30 months.
In the current study, we report our entire experience
with HAI and SYS in a large series of patients with unresectable ICC. Patients with liver-confined disease who
were treated with both HAI and SYS experienced better
response rates and improved survival in comparison with
patients who received only SYS (30.8 vs 18.4 months,
respectively); this survival benefit was maintained when
patients with nodal disease were included in the survival
analysis (29.6 vs 15.9 months, respectively). The combination of HAI and SYS is aimed at maximizing the therapeutic effect in the liver while also treating microscopic
metastatic disease at extrahepatic sites.
Only 8 patients eventually underwent resection with
curative intent after induction treatment with SYS and/or
HAI, and the median survival time was 3 years. This
conversion-to-resectability rate is far below the rates
achieved for colorectal cancer liver metastases.34,35
Whether the combination of HAI and SYS can lead to
improved resectability rates for this disease, which usually
presents at an advanced, unresectable stage, merits more
investigation.
The main limitations of this study are its retrospective nature and the single-institution experience. The former has obvious implications for a potential bias
introduced into patient selection, whereas the latter precludes generalizability of the recommendations pending
confirmation in a multicenter study. Because a significant
proportion of the HAI patients (n 5 44) were derived
from 2 clinical trials, the generalizability of the results will
be somewhat limited, and although the inclusion of
patients with regional nodal disease helps in this regard,
confirmation of the results in larger studies will be
required. The heterogeneity of SYS regimens, which is inherent to studies other than controlled clinical trials, represents a limitation and must be considered when we are
interpreting these results. In addition, potential differences in staging might have existed between the groups
because not all patients were staged surgically; however, to
minimize this possibility, equivocal radiologic findings
were followed in serial scans to determine their nature.

Despite these limitations, however, the results of the current study represent the best reported treatment results for
patients with advanced ICC and demand that the HAI
and SYS treatment approach be further investigated.
Future studies should investigate the best systemic
regimen combined with regional FUDR. In addition,
recent studies of ICC have suggested a number of potentially exploitable mutations in known cancer-related
genes; continued efforts to characterize these mutations
may not only help to identify patients most likely to benefit from this treatment approach but also open up other
therapeutic avenues.
In conclusion, in this retrospective review, the use of
HAI chemotherapy offered a partial response in 59% of
patients and was associated with higher overall survival in
comparison with the use of SYS alone for unresectable
ICC confined to the liver and/or the portal nodes (30.8 vs
18.4 months). The efficacy of regional FUDR is established. Whether the survival benefit observed in our study
is derived from the use of FUDR will need to be answered
in larger prospective studies.
