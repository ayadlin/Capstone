ABSTRACT
In the present study, we demonstrate that prolonged treatment by trastuzumab
induced resistance of NCI-N87 gastric cancer cells to trastuzumab. The resistant
cells possessed typical characteristics of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)/
cancer stem cells and acquired more invasive and metastatic potentials both in
vitro and in vivo. Long term treatment with trastuzumab dramatically inhibited the
phosphorylation of Akt, but triggered the activation of STAT3. The level of IL-6 was
remarkably increased, implicating that the release of IL-6 that drives the STAT3
activation initiates the survival signaling transition. Furthermore, the Notch activities
were significantly enhanced in the resistant cells, companied by upregulation of the
Notch ligand Jagged-1 and the Notch responsive genes Hey1 and Hey2. Inhibiting the
endogenous Notch pathway reduced the IL-6 expression and restored the sensitivities
of the resistant cells to trastuzumab. Blocking of the STAT3 signaling abrogated IL6-induced Jagged-1 expression, effectively inhibited the growth of the trastuzumab
resistant cells, and enhanced the anti-tumor activities of trastuzumab in the resistant
cells. These findings implicate that the IL-6/STAT3/Jagged-1/Notch axis may be a
useful target and that combination of the Notch or STAT3 inhibitors with trastuzumab
may prevent or delay clinical resistance and improve the efficacy of trastuzumab in
gastric cancer.

INTRODUCTION

positive tumors [1, 2].
However, resistance to trastuzumab is common in
both breast and gastric cancers. Her2 is overexpressed in
~25% of gastric cancer patients, who would supposedly
benefit from trastuzumab therapy [3]. Unfortunately,
the response rate to trastuzumab among the patients is
only 12.8%, which is much lower than that previously
reported in breast cancer [4]. Currently, much of what
we know about the resistant mechanisms associated
with trastuzumab, including hyperactivation of the
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, deficiency
of phosphatase and tensin homolog, an inhibitor of the
PI3K/AKT pathway, and mutation in the catalytic subunit

Trastuzumab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody
directed to the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
(Her2), has been used as standard therapy in advanced
Her2-positive breast cancers. It is also indicated in
Her2-positive advanced gastric cancers in combination
with chemotherapy. The international phase III trial of
trastuzumab for gastric cancer showed a clinically and
statistically significant benefit in terms of response rate,
median progression-free survival, and median overall
survival. Currently, trastuzumab is approved for the
clinical treatment of gastric cancer patients with Her2www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

α of PI3K [5-12], comes from the researches in breast
cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of intrinsic
or acquired trastuzumab resistance in gastric cancer have
not been extensively explored.
Tumor cells frequently display initial sensitivity to
anti-tumor therapeutic drugs, but acquire resistance during
the treatment. Several recent studies demonstrated that
long-term treatment of tumor cells with chemotherapeutic
drugs (such as 3-aminobenzamide, doxorubicin, and
cisplatin) in vitro resulted in enrichment of the cell
population with the characteristics of cancer stem cell
(CSC) (the expression of stemness-related genes, high
clonogenicity, self-renewal capacity, resistance to the
cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy, and, critically, the
ability to initiate the original tumors upon transplantation
in immunodeficient mice). CSCs could also be enriched
in xenogeneic tumors following chemotherapy or arise
from differentiated cancer cells through epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT). The importance of
EMT in tumor invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance
has been increasingly recognized [13-15]. So far, it has
been unknown that whether and how the phenotypes
and biobehaviors of gastric cancer cells resistant to
trastuzumab are altered.
Here, we provide evidence showing that acquisition
of trastuzumab resistance is associated with the formation
of EMT/CSC phenotype and transition of survival
signaling through activating IL-6/STAT3/Jagged-1/Notch
positive feedback signaling loop in gastric cancer cells.

resistance in gastric cancer cells, we reperformed the
experiment. Fig. 1G shows that following exposure of
NCI-N87 cells to 2.5 μg/ml trastuzumab for one week, the
expression of the epithelial markers, including E-cadherin
and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1, a critical regulator of
epithelial tight junctions) was significantly increased.
Another epithelial marker, claudin-1 (an adhesion
molecule) was not changed. Increased levels of E-cadherin
and ZO-1 were sustained for six weeks. Interestingly, the
expression of these molecules was either disappeared or
declined subsequently. Concomitant with the decrease of
the epithelial markers, the expression of a mesenchymal
marker vimentin and EMT regulatory factors ZEB1 and
Slug were markedly increased by six weeks of treatment
with trastuzumab. The expression of these mesenchymal
markers was maintained at high levels up to 12 weeks.
The upregulation of ZEB1 at the transcription level was
also detected (Fig. 1H and 1I). Noticeably, upregulation
of Snail, a transcription repressor of E-cadherin was
coincident with the elevation of the E-cadherin and ZO-1
levels, implicating a negative feedback mechanism of
regulating the expression of the epithelial markers by
Snail. β-catenin is an essential component of adherent
junctions. The E-cadherin-catenin complex modulates
cell-cell adhesion and cell migration. It has been reported
that activation of the β-catenin pathway is critical for the
maintenance of EMT and that β-catenin was involved in
regulation of EMT-like behaviors in tamoxifen-resistant
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells [16, 17]. We noticed
that the β-catenin level was prominently elevated after
trastuzumab treatment for six weeks (Fig. 1G). These data
suggest that gastric cancer cells underwent EMT during
development of trastuzumab resistance.

RESULTS
Trastuzumab resistance is associated with EMT in
gastric cancer cells

Trastuzumab resistant cells have high potentials
of migration, invasion, tumorigenesis, and
metastasis

To model the development of acquired trastuzumab
resistance in patients, we treated Her2-overexpressing
human gastric cancer cells (NCI-N87 and MKN-45) with
increasing doses of trastuzumab for eight months and
obtained the trastuzumab-resistant sublines NCI-N87-R
and MKN-45-R. Compared with parental NCI-N87
cells, NCI-N87-R cells exhibited remarkable resistance
to trastuzumab in vitro (Fig. 1A). Loss of an epithelial
marker E-cadherin expression is a hallmark of EMT. We
observed that the level of E-cadherin was dramatically
downregulated and a mesenchymal marker vimentin,
which was negative in the parental cells, upregulated in
the resistant cells (Fig. 1B and 1C). Similar data were also
observed in MKN-45 cells (Fig. 1D and 1E). In addition,
an important EMT regulator, E-cadherin transcriptional
repressor ZEB1 was also upregulated (Fig. 1F), suggesting
that trastuzumab resistant cells underwent a phenotypic
conversion.

EMT process is generally accompanied with an
enhancement in cellular invasion and migration [18, 19].
We evaluated the migration activities of the resistant cells
by wound healing assays. Compared to their parental
cells, NCI-N87-R and MKN-45-R cells had significantly
higher migration activities, as evidenced by the fact that
a more rapid and complete wound closure was observed
in these cells (Fig. 2A, 2B, and 2C). We utilized a more
physiological approach, three-dimensional (3D) cell
culture to assess tumor cell invasion. As shown in Fig. 2D
and 2E, NCI-N87-R cells displayed a remarkable capacity
to invade through a reconstituted basement membrane
(Matrigel).

with PolyHEMA in the media containing 1% serum. The
cells grew predominantly as a single-cell suspension.
NCI-N87 cells underwent anoikis after loss of detachment
for 72 h, with the anoikis rates of approximately 60%.
Conversely, NCI-N87-R cells exhibited a significant
resistance to anoikis and the anoikis rate was only about
10% (Fig. 2F), indicating that the growth of the cells is
in an anchorage-independent manner. In addition, NCIN87-R and MKN-45-R cells could more actively form

colonies in soft agar, compared with their parental cells
(Fig. 2G, 2H, and 2I). In the presence of trastuzumab,
the proliferation of NCI-N87-R cells was not affected.
In contrast, when trastuzumab was added, NCI-N87 cells
almost stopped growing and colonies formed by NCI-N87
cells were much smaller and less (Fig. 2G and 2H). These
data suggest that trastuzumab resistant cells acquired
malignant traits.
We then evaluated the tumorigenic potential of the
cells in an animal model. Several independent experiments

cultured in 96-well plates with an initial cell density of 4 × 103/well in DMEM containing 0, 5, or 10 μg/ml trastuzumab for five days.
The in vitro proliferation activities were measured by CCK8 assays. B, The expression of E-cadherin and vimentin in NCI-N87 and NCIN87-R cells was analyzed by Western blot. C, NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells were labeled with the rabbit monoclonal antibodies against
E-cadherin and vimentin. Binding was detected by Alexa fluor 549-labeled secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI.

points after trastuzumab treatment. These experiments were repeated in duplicate. ** P<0.01.

plates. The confluent cell monolayers were wounded by scraping and the closure of the wounded areas was monitored. The images of the
wounds were taken at the indicated time points (A) and the rate of cell migration by measuring the distance traveled toward the center
of the wound was calculated (B). C, Migration activities of MKN-45 and MKN-45-R cells were analyzed by scratch wound assays and
the images of the wounds were taken at 0 and 30 h. D and E, NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells were suspended in a mixture of Matrigel
matrix and culture medium (1:24, v/v) and then layered onto solidified Matrigel. The images were taken after 10 days of culture (D).
The invasive structures in 3D cell cultures were counted in five random areas under a light microscope (E). F, NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R
cells were cultured in the plates coated with PolyHEMA for 72 h and cellular apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using Annexin
V-FITC detection kit. G and H, 5 × 103 NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells were suspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.35% agar
and plated on top of the bottom layer of 0.6% agarose in six-well plates. 5 μg/ml trastuzumab or PBS was added twice a week. Colonies
were stained with MTT, photographed (G) and counted (H) after 16 days. I, Soft agar colony formation assays were performed in MKN-45
and MKN-45-R cells and photographs taken. These experiments were performed in duplicate. J, 2 × 105, 1 × 105, and 0.5 × 105 NCI-N87
and NCI-N87-R cells were injected subcutaneously in the left and right upper flank of the mice, respectively. 20 days following tumor cell
implantation, the mice bearing tumors were photographed. K, 2 × 106 NCI-N87 or NCI-N87-R cells were injected subcutaneously in the
right upper flank of the mice. 40 days following tumor implantation, the livers of the mice were autopsied and paraffin embedded. The
sections were stained with HE. White arrows point to mitotic cells. Bar = 200 μm ** P<0.01

105, 1 × 105, and 0.5 × 105 NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells
were subcutaneously injected into athymic nude mice.
When minimal numbers of cells (0.5 × 105) per mouse
were injected, NCI-N87-R cells formed tumors within 10
days. The implantation of greater numbers of NCI-N87-R
cells produced larger tumors. However, even maximal
numbers of NCI-N87 cells (2 ×105) were injected, no
tumors were generated within 20 days (Fig. 2J). To further
confirm it, the mice were divided into six groups randomly
and each group contained five mice. 2 × 105, 0.5 × 105,
or 5 × 103 NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells were injected
subcutaneously to the mice. The tumors were detected
in the mice injected with 2 × 105, 0.5 × 105, or 5 × 103
NCI-N87-R cells within 7, 10 or 20 days, respectively. No
tumor was observed within 20 days in the mice injected
with an equal number of NCI-N87 cells. Tumor formation
only occurred after implantation of 2 × 105 NCI-N87
cells for 36 days (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
The data suggest that the resistant cells may possess the
characteristics of tumor-propagating cells.
We examined liver metastases from the xenografts
in nude mice. As displayed in Fig. 2K, subcutaneous

implantation of 5×106 NCI-N87-R cells resulted in
spontaneous liver metastases in nude mice and vigorous
mitosis was observed in the metastatic loci. NCI-N87
xenografts did not develop liver metastasis. We detected
the expression of vimentin in the xenograft tumors
by immunohistochemistry. The data demonstrate that
vimentin is predominantly expressed in mesenchymal
cells, which were around NCI-N87 xenograft tumor
tissues. However, the expression of vimentin was found
to localize in both tumor and mesenchymal cells in the
NCI-N87-R xenograft tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
In addition, the expression of E-cadherin was lost and
ZEB-1 significantly upregulated in NCI-N87-R xenograft
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1D). These data confirm
that trastuzumab resistant cells have higher potentials of
migration, invasion, tumorigenesis, and metastasis.

Trastuzumab resistant gastric cancer cells acquire
the phenotype of cancer stem-like cells
It is known that EMT can endow cells with stem-cell
like characteristics, such as self-renewal, differentiation,

expression of CD44 in NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells was detected by real-time RT-PCR (A) and flow cytometry (B). C, The alteration of
CD44 at the mRNA and protein levels was analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blot at the indicated time points after trastuzumab treatment.
D and E, The in vitro self-renewal capacities of NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells were assessed by spheroid colony formation assays by
culturing the cells under nonadherent conditions with serum-free media. After two weeks of culture, spheres were photographed (D) and
sphere number per 100 cells was counted (E). F, The expression of CD44, CD133, and OCT-4 was analyzed by Western blot in NCI-N87
and NCI-N87-R cells. The experiments were performed at least twice. ** P<0.01

and resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Several
previous studies demonstrated that CD44-positive gastric
cancer cells possessed the features of CSC. In severe
combined immunodeficiency mice, CD44-positive gastric
cancer cells are highly tumorigenic and resistant to
chemotherapeutics or radiation [20, 21]. CD44 is a cell
surface transmembrane receptor for hyaluronic acid, one
of the extracellular matrix components and participates
in regulating cell-cell interaction, cell adhesion, and
migration. CD44 is also a known downstream target of
Wnt/β-catenin pathway and expressed in a variety of
solid tumors including gastric cancer [22]. We analyzed
the expression of CD44 in NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R
cells by real-time RT-PCR and flow cytometry. The level
of CD44 in parental NCI-N87 cells was very low, which
is consistent with the data presented in a previous study
[18]. However, NCI-N87-R cells expressed significantly
higher level of CD44 at both mRNA and protein levels
(Fig. 3A and 3B). Noticeably, the expression of the
CD44 mRNA and protein was upregulated at the sixth
week of postinduction with trastuzumab (Fig. 3C and
Supplementary Fig. S2A) and elevation of the CD44 level
was accompanied by upregulation of key EMT inducers,
Slug and ZEB1 (Fig. 1G).
To determine the in vitro self-renewal capacity
of NCI-N87-R cells, we performed spheroid colony
formation assays by culturing NCI-N87-R cells under
nonadherent conditions with serum-free media. The
growth of spherical colonies, which is considered as an
indication of self-renewal ability, was observed after
culturing for two weeks. As expected, NCI-N87-R cells
generated significantly larger and more spheroid colonies
than NCI-N87 cells (Fig. 3D and 3E). Based on previous
published reports regarding CSC markers in gastric cancer
cells, we also examined other stemness markers, which
are highly expressed in gastric cancer, including CD133
and the octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) that
is involved in regulating pluripotency and self-renewal
maintenance of embryonic stem cells. Fig. 3F shows that
NCI-N87-R cells expressed higher levels of CD133 and
OCT4 than parental cells. Enhanced expression of OCT4
was also observed in MKN-45-R cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). Intriguingly, NCI-N87-R cells maintained
this phenotype even in the absence of trastuzumab in
subsequent passages. As mentioned above, the NCIN87-R cells yielded tumors with as few as 5 × 103 cells
in all mice. These data clearly indicate that trastuzumab
resistant NCI-N87-R cells acquire the phenotype of cancer
stem-like cells.

as a key mediator of trastuzumab resistance in breast
cancer [23]. To explore the signaling mechanisms of
trastuzumab resistance in gastric cancer, we examined
the phosphorylation status of Akt, ERK, and STAT3,
which are well known to be major cell survival pathways
mediated by Her2. In parental NCI-N87 cells, the
phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK were high,
whereas the phoshorylation of STAT3 was barely detected.
The ERK phosphorylation status was not changed in
NCI-N87-R cells. Surprisingly, phosphorylated STAT3
level was dramatically increased in NCI-N87-R cells,
but the phosphorylation of Akt was almost completely
disappeared (Fig. 4A), implicating that the survival
signaling on which the growth of parental NCI-N87
cells depended may be shifted. To evaluate the STAT3
transcription activities, NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells
were co-transfected with the STAT3 reporter plasmid and
the transcriptional activities of STAT3 were determined by
luciferase assays. Fig. 4B demonstrates that the luciferase
activities in NCI-N87-R cells were significantly increased
by nearly nine-folds compared to NCI-N87 cells. Time
course analyses show that the phosporylation of Akt was
remarkably decreased after trastuzumab treatment for one
week and then hardly detectable after 12 weeks, reflecting
the inhibitory effect of trastuzumab on the Akt activation.
Noticeable, the STAT3 phosphorylation was initiated at
the sixth week of posttreatment with trastuzumab and
remained persistently high up to 20 weeks (Fig. 4C).
Elevated phosphorylation of STAT3 was also seen in
MKN-45-R cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
To determine the importance of the STAT3 signaling
pathway in the growth of the resistant cells, we treated
the cells with GDC0941 (a potent inhibitor of PI3Kα/δ),
PD184352 (an ATP non-competitive MEK1/2 inhibitor),
and WP1066 (an inhibitor of Jak2/STAT3). Fig. 4D shows
that 10 ng/ml of trastuzumab could effectively suppress
the growth of NCI-N87 cells. All inhibitors appeared to
have inhibitory effects on the growth of the parental cells.
GDC0941 could enhance the antiproliferation activities of
trastuzumab in the parental cells. However, GDC0941 and
PD184352 did not affect the proliferation of NCI-N87-R
cells, but treatment with WP1066 significantly inhibited
the growth of NCI-N87-R cells. Combined treatment with
trastuzumab and WP1066 resulted in a more dramatic
growth inhibition of the resistant cells. Taken together,
the data indicate that the survival signaling is shifted in
trastuzumab resistant NCI-N87-R cells and that STAT3
plays a predominant role in the survival and proliferation
of NCI-N87-R cells.

IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, activate STAT3 either directly
or indirectly [24, 25]. A previous study demonstrates that
development of trastuzumab resistant in breast cancer
cells is mediated by activation of an IL-6 inflammatory
feedback loop [10]. Gastric mucosal inflammation has
been associated with tumorigenesis of gastric cancer.
IL-6 as an important activator of oncogenic STAT3 links
inflammation to malignant transformation by activating
several inflammation-related signaling pathways and
inducing EMT. Therefore, we examined the effects of

trastuzumab treatment on the expression and secretion
of IL-6 in parental and trastuzumab resistant NCI-N87-R
cells. In parental NCI-N87 cells there was no detectable
expression and secretion of IL-6. However, the expression
of the IL-6 mRNA was dramatically increased by more
than 150-folds (Fig. 5A) and the secretion level of IL-6
as high as 7000 pg/ml in NCI-N87-R cells (Fig. 5B). We
noticed that the temporal spatial expression pattern of IL-6
was coincident with the phenotypic transition of NCI-N87
cells and activation of STAT3 (Fig. 5C to 5E). In the

parental cells, the level of phosphorylated STAT3 was very
low, but STAT3 was constitutively activated in NCI-N87-R
cells. Addition of recombinant IL-6 caused a marked
increase of phosphorylated STAT3 in both NCI-N87 and
NCI-N87-R cells (Fig. 5F). The anti-proliferation effect
of trastuzumab was significantly abrogated by IL-6 in
parental NCI-N87 cells (Fig. 5G). Treatment with WP1066
alone dramatically caused apoptosis of NCI-N87R cells
and combination of trastuzumab with WP1066 induced a
much stronger pro-apoptosis effect (Fig. 5H). Together,
these results suggest that IL-6 autocrine is involved in
development of trastuzumab resistance in NCI-N87 cells.

The oncogenic functions of the Notch signaling
have been well documented and the roles of the Notch
signaling in various stem and early progenitor cells have
also been recognized [26]. Several recent studies indicate
that IL-6 is a novel Notch target in breast cancer cells and
enhanced Notch signaling upregulates the IL-6 expression,
leading to activation of autocrine and paracrine Jak/STAT
signaling. On the other hand, the IL-6 signaling can drive

the expression of Notch-dependent genes. It has also
been reported that IL-6 induces malignant phenotypes
in Notch-expressing stem/progenitor cells from human
breast cancer [27-30]. To determine whether the Notch
signaling is activated in the resistant cells, we transfected
NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells with a Notch reporter
plasmid and measured the luciferase activities. Fig. 6A
shows that the Notch reporter activities were significantly
higher (approximately six folds) in NCI-N87-R cells
than in NCI-N87 cells. The expression of the Notch
ligand Jagged-1 was also remarkably enhanced in NCIN87-R and MKN-45-R cells (Fig. 6B and Supplementary
Fig. S2B). Moreover, Notch cleavage products that are
indicative of the Notch activation were observed in NCIN87-R cells (Fig. 6B). In addition, the expression of the
Notch target genes Hey1 and Hey2 at the mRNA levels
was remarkably increased by about 20 and seven folds,
respectively (Fig. 6C and 6D). We noticed that elevation
of the Hey1 mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig.
S3A) was coincident with the upregulation of the IL-6
mRNA expression (Fig. 5D), whereas the level of Hey2
was progressively elevated (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Ecotopic overexpression of Jagged-1 [31] resulted in a
dramatic upregulation of the Hey1, Hey2, and IL-6 at the
mRNA level (Fig. 6E, 6F, and Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Knock-down of the Jagged-1 expression in NCI-N87-R
cells remarkably restored the expression of E-cadherin
and suppressed the expression of vimentin (Fig. 6G).
These data indicate that the activation of the Jagged-1/
Notch signaling pathway is involved in the development
of trastuzumab resistance in gastric cancer cells.
Notch signaling is initiated by γ-secretase-dependent
cleavage of the Notch receptor following binding of the
Notch receptors to their cognate ligands [32]. We observed
that treatment of NCI-N87-R cells with γ-secretase
inhibitor DAPT effectively repressed the expression
of IL-6 (Fig. 6H), demonstrating that activation of the
Notch signaling is associated with the production of
IL-6 in NCI-N87-R cells. Il-6 stimulation upregulated
the expression of Jagged-1 in a time-dependent manner
(Fig. 6I and Supplementary Fig. S4B). WP1066 but not
PD184352 markedly inhibited IL-6-induced Jagged-1
expression (Fig. 6I). Although inhibition of the Notch
pathway by γ-secretase inhibitor LY411575 alone did not
markedly repress the proliferation of NCI-N87-R cells
in 3D culture system, invasive potential of NCI-N87-R
cells appeared to be reduced (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
Simultaneous blocking of the STAT3 and Notch pathways
by WP1066 and LY411575 almost completely inhibited
the proliferation of NCI-N87-R cells in 3D culture system
and also greatly suppressed self-renewal capacities (sphere
formation) of NCI-N87-R cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A
and S5B). Additionally, LY411575 also significantly
restored the sensitivity of the resistant cells to trastuzumab
(Supplementary Fig. S5C). These data demonstrate that
IL-6/STAT3 and Jagged-1/Notch pathways synergize in

induction of trastuzumab resistance in gastric cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
The development of resistance is a major obstacle to
trastuzumab-based treatment in both Her2-overexpressing
breast and gastric cancers. Multiple mechanisms driving
trastuzumab resistance have been proposed in breast
cancer [33], but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms
exist in gastric cancer [34-36]. Exploration of the
molecular mechanisms and identification of the phenotypic
identity of resistant cells will facilitate the discovery of
novel targets and development of personalized therapies
in gastric cancer.
In the present study, we obtained trastuzumabresistant sublines from human gastric cancer cell lines
NCI-N87 and MKN-45 by repetitive, dose-escalating
trastuzumab treatment in vitro. The cell populations
exhibited typical characteristics of EMT (loss or
downregulation of epithelial markers E-cadherin and
ZO-1 and gain of mesenchymal markers vimentin,
ZEB1, Slug, and Snail) and acquired more invasive and
metastatic potentials both in vitro and in vivo (invasively
growth in 3D culture and spontaneous liver metastasis
in nude mice). EMT can trigger reversion to a CSC-like
phenotype. CSCs, which have tumor-initiating capability
and high metastatic potential, tend to be resistant to
conventional therapeutic strategies such as radiotherapy
or chemotherapy. The emergence of EMT and CSCs
by treatment with chemotherapeutic agents has been
reported [14]. We found that the long-term trastuzumab
treatment induced CSC-like properties in gastric cancer
cells, including elevated expression of CD44, CD133, and
OCT4, self-renewal (forming mammospheres), higher
clonogenicity, and increased tumorigeniticy. These data
indicate that prolonged treatment by trastuzumab induces
EMT and CSC-like phenotype in gastric cancer cells,
resulting in resistance to trastuzumab.
Tumors with aberrantly activated oncogenes
are frequently ‘‘addicted’’ to the oncogene-associated
signaling pathways [37]. In NCI-N87 cells, ERK and
Akt are constitutively active, implicating that the ERK
and PI3K/Akt pathways are major signaling pathways
for survival of NCI-N87 cells. Prolonged treatment by
trastuzumab dramatically inhibited the phosphorylation
of Akt, but triggered the activation of STAT3, indicating
that inhibition of the survival signaling, which parental
NCI-N87 cells were addicted to, are compensated by
activating the STAT3 signaling pathway. Activation of
feedback compensation circuit following inhibition of
survival signaling has been associated with drug resistance.
The coupling of the PI3K/Akt signaling blocking and
STAT3 activation is an important event that promotes
survival of the resistant gastric cancer cells in the presence
of trastuzumab. Several survival signaling pathways, such
as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3K/

Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and
Notch pathways, have been linked to the drug resistance
of conventional chemotherapy [38-42]. For example,
ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase
are activated following exposure to chemotherapeutics
in a variety of cancer cells, such as melanoma, breast,
colon, and hepatocellular cancer cells [43, 44]. Activation
of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is known to
mediate resistance to both chemotherapy and molecularly
targeted therapy in various cancers [45, 46]. A recent
study demonstrates that inhibition of EGFR by erlotinib,
an EGFR inhibitor results in activation of the STAT3
signaling in lung cancer cells [47]. We found that the level
of IL-6 was extremely high after trastuzumab treatment for
six weeks when the STAT3 signaling became predominant
survival signaling pathway in the resistant gastric cancer
cells, implicating that the release of IL-6 that drives the
STAT3 activation in response to trastuzumab initiates
the survival signaling transition, which contributes to
resistance to trastuzumab via a feedback mechanism.
The previous studies suggested that the Notch
signaling is involved in chemotherapy-triggered CSC
transition. Activation of the Notch signaling is also
associated with induction of EMT. It is reported that the
Notch signaling is important for the maintenance of selfrenewal in human CD34+ cord blood cells and cancerinitiating cells as well [48, 49]. IL-6 is also capable of
expanding CSCs and inducing EMT [50]. A recent report
identified IL-6 as a target of Notch in breast cancer
cells. It was shown that activated Notch1 induced the
IL-6 transcription via interaction with the IL-6 promoter
[51]. In NCI-N87 cells stimulation by IL-6 induced
the expression of Jagged-1, whereas overexpression
of Jagged-1, in turn, promoted the expression of IL-6
that triggered the activation of STAT3. Blocking the
STAT3 activation by WP1066 effectively abrogated IL6-induced Jagged-1 expression, strongly inhibited the
growth of the trastuzumab resistant cells, and enhanced
the anti-tumor activities of trastuzumab in the resistant
cells. The data suggest that autocrine release of IL-6 and
activation of Notch may comprise a positive feedback
loop [28, 30]. We observed that the Notch activities were
significantly enhanced in the resistant cells, companied
by a substantial increase in the expression of Jagged-1
and the Notch responsive genes Hey1 and Hey2.
Inhibiting the endogenous Notch pathway by γ-secretase
inhibitor DAPT reduced the IL-6 expression. However,
the upregulation of IL-6 in NCI-N87-R cells could not
be completely blocked by DAPT. A previous study
showed that preclinical efficacy of γ-secretase inhibitor,
RO4929097 could be abrogated by overexpression of IL-6
[52]. It was also reported that Src activity was markedly
increased in trastuzumab resistant gastric cancer cells [53]
and that activated Src was capable of interacting with and
activating Stat3 in fibroblasts [54], implying that other
signaling pathways may also be involved in development
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of trastuzumab resistance. Simultaneous inhibition of
the STAT3 and Notch pathways greatly inhibited the
malignant behaviors of NCI-N87-R cells. Additionally,
inhibition of STAT3 or Notch signaling pathway
significantly restored the sensitivity of the resistant cells to
trastuzumab. The findings suggest that sustained activation
of the Jagged-1/Notch signaling in gastric cancer cells
elicits an aberrant release of IL-6, leading to the transition
of survival signaling, phenotype conversion, and
resistance to trastuzumab. Our data support the hypothesis
that cancer cells may undergo adaptive changes after antitumor therapies (either chemotherapy or targeted therapy)
and also demonstrate that the IL-6/STAT3/Jagged-1/Notch
signaling pathway exerts critical functions in trastuzumab
resistant gastric cancer cells.
In summary, our data indicate that prolonged
treatment by trastuzumab induced resistance in Her2overexpressing gastric cancer cells. Blocking of a major
survival pathway by trastuzumab is associated with
production of IL-6, compensatory activation of STAT3,
induction of EMT/CSC-like phenotype, and survival of
resistant cells in the presence of trastuzumab, revealing
an important cell-protective feedback mechanism. These
findings implicate that the IL-6/STAT3/Jagged-1/Notch
axis may be a useful target and combination of the STAT3
or Notch inhibitors with trastuzumab may prevent or delay
clinical resistance and improve the efficacy of trastuzumab
in gastric cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and treatment
Human gastric cancer cell lines NCI-N87 and
MKN-45 are obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml), and
streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37°C under 5 % CO2.
Trastuzumab resistant NCI-N87 (NCI-N87-R) or MKN45 (MKN-45-R) cells were established by culturing the
cells in increasing concentration of trastuzumab over a one
year period and final concentration of trastuzumab was 10
μg/ml at the end of the period.

Western blot
The following antibodies were used for
immunoblotting: the antibodies against E-cadherin
(Cell Signaling), vimentin (Cell signaling), ZO1 (Cell
signaling), Claudin-1 (Cell Signaling), β-catenin (Cell
Signaling), ZEB1 (Cell Signaling), Slug (Cell Signaling),

measured by CCK8 assays following the manufacturer’s
instruction. The experiments were performed in duplicate.

Scratch wound assay

Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and
confocal microscopy

NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells were cultured in sixwell plates. The confluent cell monolayers were wounded
by scraping once horizontally and vertically with a 200
μl pipette tip and further incubated in DMEM with 0.5%
FBS. The images of the wounds at different time points
were captured using the Olympus CKX41 microscope
system.

The parental and trastuzumab resistant gastric cancer
cells were labeled with the rabbit monoclonal antibodies
against E-cadherin and vimentin. Bound antibodies were
detected by Alexafluor 549-labeled (red) secondary
antibody (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml
DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Sigma). The cells
were observed under a laser-scanning confocal microscope
(LSM 510 META, ZEISS). The experiment was repeated
in duplicate.
The xenograft tumor tissues were fixed and
embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry assay was
performed as described previously [34]. The expression of
vimentin was detected by the rabbit monoclonal antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology). Images were taken under
a microscope (Olympus) using the Spot insight image
capture system CCD camera.

3D cell culture
3D cell cultures were performed as described in the
previous study [55]. Briefly, NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R
cells (1 × 105/ml) were suspended in a mixture of Matrigel
matrix (BD-Biosciences) and culture medium (1:24, v/v)
and then layered onto solidified Matrigel. After one week
incubation, the images of the cells were captured using the
Olympus CKX41 microscope system.

Anoikis assay

Conventional and quantitative RT-PCR

NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells were cultured in
the plates coated with PolyHEMA (Sigma) to avoid the
adhesion of cells as described previously [56]. After
incubation for 72 h, the cells were harvested and cell
apoptosis was measured using Annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) detection kit (Calbiochem). The
experiment was performed for three times.

The total RNA was isolated from NCI-N87 cells,
which were cultured with the media containing 10 μg/
ml trastuzumab, using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) at the
indicated time points. cDNA were synthesized by using
reverse transcription kit (Promega) in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions. The specific primers
(Supplementary Table S1) were used to detect the mRNA
expression of ZEB1, IL-6, Hey1, Hey2, and CD44.
Amplification of β-actin with the primers (Supplementary
Table S1) was used as the control. The conventional and
quantitative RT-PCR experiments were conducted as
described in our previous study. The experiments were
performed three times independently.

Colony-formation assay
Anchorage-independent growth of cells was
determined by soft agar colony formation assays. The
parental and trastuzumab resistant gastric cancer cells
were suspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.7%
agar and plated on top of the bottom layer of 1.2% agar
in six-well plates and fed twice a week by adding 0.3 ml
medium with or without 5 μg/ml trastuzumab. Colonies
were stained with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5
diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), photographed, and
measured after 16 days. The experiment was repeated
twice.

Proliferation assay
NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells were cultured
in 96-well plates with an initial cell density of 4 × 103/
well in DMEM containing 0, 5, or 10 μg/ml trastuzumab.
To determine the roles of the STAT3, AKT, and ERK
signaling in the development of trastuzumab resistance,
cells were treated with 5 μM WP1066 (Jak2/STAT3
inhibitor, Calbiochem), 100 nM GDC0941 (PI3K inhibitor,
Calbiochem), 10 μM LY411575 (selective γ-secretase
inhibitor) or 1 μM PD184352 (MEK1/2 inhibitor,
Calbiochem), respectively. After incubation for different
time periods, the in vitro proliferation activities were

tumors were taken. Alternatively, 2 × 105, 0.5 × 105, or
5 × 103 NCI-N87 and NCI-N87-R cells were injected
subcutaneously to the mice.

Cell sphere culture

Statistical analysis

NCI-N87 or NCI-N87-R cells were collected and
washed to remove sera and then suspended in serum-free
DMEM/F12 medium containing 100 ng/ml recombinant
human epidermal growth factor, 20 ng/ml recombinant
human basic fibroblast growth factor, 2% B27 supplement
without vitamin A, 1% N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 100
IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells
were subsequently cultured in ultra low attachment sixwell plates (Corning) at a density of 1000 cells/well for
two weeks.

All data were presented as mean±SD. Student’s t
test was used for comparison between two groups. For
comparison of three or more groups, one-way ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni post hoc test was used. P<0.05
was considered statistically significant.
