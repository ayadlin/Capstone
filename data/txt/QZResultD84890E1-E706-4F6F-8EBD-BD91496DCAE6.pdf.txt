BACKGROUND: Recurrence is a major cause of treatment failure after allogeneic transplantation for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and treatment options are very limited. Azacitidine is a
DNA methyltransferase inhibitor with activity in myeloid disease. The authors hypothesized that low-dose azacitidine
administered after transplant would reduce recurrence rates, and conducted a study to determine a safe dose/schedule combination. METHODS: Forty-five high-risk patients were treated. Median age was 60 years; median number of
comorbidities was 3; 67% were not in remission. By using a Bayesian adaptive method to determine the best dose/
schedule combination based on time to toxicity, the authors investigated combinations of 5 daily azacitidine doses,
8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 mg/m2, and 4 schedules: 1, 2, 3, or 4 cycles, each with 5 days of drug and 25 days of rest. Cycle
1 started on Day þ40. RESULTS: Reversible thrombocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. The optimal combination was 32 mg/m2 given for 4 cycles. Median follow-up was 20.5 months. One-year event-free and overall survival
were 58% and 77%, justifying further studies to estimate long-term clinical benefit. No dose significantly affected
DNA global methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine at 32 mg/m2 given for 5 days is safe and can be administered
after allogeneic transplant for at least 4 cycles to heavily pretreated AML/MDS patients. The trial also suggested that
this treatment may prolong event-free and overall survival, and that more cycles may be associated with greater

nonrecurrence mortality remain a major cause of treatment failure for patients transplanted without remission.1,2 Preparative regimen dose escalation has failed to
improve results significantly, in large part because of a
direct relationship between dose intensity and treatmentrelated mortality. The CR rate with HSCT, however, is
high, and most patients transplanted in recurrence will be
in morphologic remission after HSCT, but these remissions are usually short-lived. Because most recurrences
occur early, any preventative intervention must be
implemented during the first 3 months after HSCT to be
effective. In this scenario, new strategies for maintaining
remission are needed.
Pharmacologic maintenance is difficult to achieve
with traditional agents because of multiple drug interactions and myelosuppression risk. An ideal drug should
have activity against the disease, without excessive myelosuppression. Azacitidine is effective in MDS in doses that
are likely to induce severe pancytopenia after HSCT.3
This hypomethylating agent appears to reverse DNA
hypermethylation, leading to silencing of tumor-suppressing genes in malignant cells. Azacitidine and decitabine
may also cause phenotypic modification of leukemic cells
(including increased expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and human leukocyte antigen [HLA]DR) and induction of expression of cancer antigens that
could potentially enhance the graft-versus-leukemia
effect.4-9 We have shown that low-dose azacitidine is
moderately active in reinducing remission and donor
chimerism for patients with indolent AML/MDS recurrences after HSCT, using doses ranging from 16 to
40 mg/m2 for 5 days in 28- to 30-day cycles.10
We therefore hypothesized that azacitidine might
decrease the recurrence rate after HSCT. However,
it might worsen graft-versus-host disease (GVHD),
compromise graft function and immune recovery, or
induce other adverse effects. A phase 1 study consequently
was necessary. We were also interested in demonstrating
that the drug can be administered repeatedly after transplant, assuming that patients treated early on, when grafts
are vulnerable to myelosuppression, would be able to
safely receive longer administration schedules in future
studies. Herein we present the results of such study.

2 or high-risk) aged 18 to 75 years, not in first CR (CR1),
who were not candidates for myeloablative transplant
regimens because of older age or comorbidities. After
establishing the low toxicity profile of azacitidine, we
amended the protocol to allow inclusion of high-risk CR1
patients. Donors could be related or unrelated, matched
at HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 (1 mismatch
allowed), typed as previously described.12
Other eligibility criteria included a left ventricular
ejection fraction >40%, a forced expiratory volume at
1 second, forced vital capacity, and diffusing capacity of
lungs for carbon monoxide >40%, creatinine <1.6 mg/
dL, bilirubin <1.6 mg/dL, human immunodeficiency
virus seronegativity, negative pregnancy test, absence of
active infection, and ability to undergo the informed
consent process. The protocol was approved by the
institutional review board at The University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
A reduced-intensity regimen of gemtuzumab ozogamicin 2 mg/m2 (given to 40 CD33-positive patients on
Day 12), fludarabine at a dose of 30 mg/m2 (on
Days 5, 4, 3, and 2), and melphalan at a dose of
140 mg/m2 (Day 2) was used.13 Patients with unrelated
or mismatched-related donors received rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) 0.5 mg/kg (Day 3) and 1.25 mg/
kg (Days 2, 1). GVHD prophylaxis was tacrolimus
and minimethotrexate (5 mg/m2 on Days 1, 3, 6, and 11),
or sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and ATG (n ¼ 5).
Supportive care was as previously described.13
Eligibility to Receive Azacitidine
Patients in CR by HSCT Day þ30 were eligible to receive
azacitidine, whereas patients with persistent disease or
without donor engraftment were removed from the study.
Other eligibility criteria to start azacitidine were as
follows: creatinine <1.6 mg/dL, bilirubin <1.6 mg/dL,
alanine aminotransferase 3  upper limit of normal,
platelet count >15,000/mm3, and absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) >1000/mm3. Patients could not have
bleeding, uncontrolled infection, or grade III/IV acute
GVHD. If not eligible for treatment during the first
3 months post-transplant, patients went off protocol.
Azacitidine was given for 1 to 4 30-day cycles. In
each cycle, the drug was administered subcutaneously for
5 days, starting on the sixth week after HSCT at 1 of
5 dose levels (8, 16, 24, 32, or 40 mg/m2).
Development of drug-related grade 3 or 4 organ
toxicity or severe infection led to azacitidine discontinuation. Azacitidine was also discontinued if platelet count

was allowed.
Evaluation of Response and Definitions
Patients had a bone marrow aspiration on transplant Days
þ30 and þ100 to þ120, and at 9 and 12 months after
transplantation. CR was defined as <6% bone marrow
blasts and evidence of donor chimerism (>80%) by DNA
microsatellite polymorphism analysis.
Bone marrow or peripheral blood donor-recipient
chimerism was evaluated using DNA microsatellite
polymorphism analysis by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). We also used conventional cytogenetic analysis
with G-banding or fluorescent in situ hybridization studies for the Y chromosome in sex-mismatched transplants.
Mixed chimerism was defined as the presence of any
detectable percentage of unsorted recipient cells or DNA.
Analysis of DNA Methylation
We studied long interspersed nuclear elements methylation, a marker of global DNA methylation using bisulfite
pyrosequencing.14 Methods for bisulfite modification of
DNA and subsequent PCR techniques are described in
http://www3.mdanderson.org/leukemia/methylation and
in Table 1. The degree of methylation was calculated
using PSQHS 96A 1.2 software (Biotage AB, Uppsala,
Sweden). Blood samples were obtained on Days 1, 5, and
21 of treatment with azacitidine (n ¼ 38 patients).
Total Design and Statistical Analysis
The primary goal was to find the best combination of peradministration dose and schedule of azacitidine. Each
patient was assigned 1 per-administration dose/schedule
combination, with schedule ¼ 1, 2, 3, or 4 cycles. The
first cycle started approximately on Day 40 post-transplant. Under schedule 1, the assigned per-administration

5422

dose was given on transplant Days 40, 41, 42, 43, and 44;
under schedule 2 on Days 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 68, 69, 70,
71, and 72, and similarly for schedules 3 and 4. The
outcome was the time to toxicity, where toxicity was
defined as any of the following adverse events occurring
within 116 days from the start of the first cycle: 1)
National Cancer Institute grade 3 or higher renal, hepatic,
cardiac, pulmonary, or neurologic toxicity; 2) grade IIIIV acute GVHD; 3) serious infection; 4) severe hematologic toxicity/graft failure; or 5) >2 dose reductions for
any reason. The Bayesian method of Braun et al15 was
used to adaptively choose each new patient’s per-administration dose/schedule combination, based on the probability of toxicity within 116 days from the start of therapy,
with the goal of choosing the per-administration dose/
schedule combination having posterior mean probability
of toxicity closest to .30, a criterion similar to that used by
the Continual Reassessment Method.16 Additional safety
rules were 1) a per-administration dose/schedule pair was
acceptably safe if the posterior probability of having likelihood of toxicity >.30 was not >.80, with no unacceptable
pairs administered; and 2) when escalating to a peradministration dose/schedule pair that had not yet been
tried, it was allowed to increase either the per-administration dose or schedule, a ‘‘do not skip’’ rule.
The trial was conducted as follows, where ‘‘escalation’’(‘‘de-escalation’’) means increasing (decreasing) peradministration dose, schedule, or both:
•
•
•

•

Treat the first patient at the lowest dose/schedule pair
(8 mg/m2, 1 cycle).
For each patient after the first, based on the current data
under the Bayesian model, determine the set of acceptably
safe per-administration dose/schedule combinations.
If none of the per-administration dose/schedule combinations are acceptably safe, then stop the trial and conclude
that none of per-administration dose/schedule combinations are acceptable.
If 1 or more per-administration dose/schedule combinations are acceptably safe, then assign the next patient to

•

the combination for which, based on the current data,
the posterior mean of probability of toxicity is closest to
the targeted value .30, subject to the escalation constraint of the ‘‘do not skip’’ rule.
If the safe dose with probability of toxicity closest to the
targeted value .30 is below the current per-administration dose/schedule combination, then there was no constraint on de-escalation.

It was planned initially to study the 3 per-administration doses of 8, 16, and 24 mg/m2. When only 1 toxicity was observed in the first 27 patients, the design was
extended to include 4 higher per-administration doses,
32, 40, 48, or 56 mg/m2, of which 48 and 56 mg/m2 were
not studied.
Unadjusted probabilities of overall survival (OS)
and event-free survival (EFS) were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method.17 The log-rank test18 was used to
compare unadjusted OS or PFS between subgroups. A
Bayesian log-normal regression model was used to assess
the effects of covariates and treatment on OS and PFS.
Covariates included log(bone marrow blast), number of
previous chemotherapy regimens (2 vs 1), cytogenetics, number of comorbidities, dose, and number of cycles
of azacitidine. The lognormal regression model was
selected using the Bayes Information Criterion and the
Bayesian chi-square method.19 Each covariate parameter
in the lognormal model linear term was assumed to follow
a normal prior with mean 0 and variance 10,000, denoted
N(0,10000), and the dispersion parameter followed a
noninformative inverse-gamma prior with mean 1 and
variance 10,000. A Bayesian logistic regression model was
fit for the binary indicator of chronic GVHD, with each
parameter in the linear term of covariates following a noninformative N(0,10000) prior. The Bayesian model fits
were carried out in WinBugs1.420; all other analyses were
carried out in Splus6.1.21 The Bayesian parametric model
underlying the method15 was fit to the final data to assess
the joint effects of per-administration dose and schedule
on the risk of toxicity.

RESULTS
Patients
Median age was 60.6 years (range, 24.3-73.8 years). Diagnoses were AML (n ¼ 37) or MDS (n ¼ 8); 67% of the
patients were not in CR at HSCT. The median number

HSCT. The median number of clinical comorbidities was
3 (Table 2), and median performance status was 1 (range,
0-2).
Donors, Grafts, and Engraftment
Donors were unrelated (42%) and related (58%). All but
3 donor-recipient pairs were fully matched. Median number of infused CD34-positive and total nucleated cells was
4.3  106 (range, 1.04-13.3) and 8.0  108 (range, 0.426.9). Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 12 days (n ¼ 45; range, 10-23) and 17 days
(n ¼ 43; range, 10-66). As expected with this preparative
regimen, most patients (96%) exhibited 100% donor
chimerism on Day 30 to 40. Azacitidine did not affect
engraftment (median of 100% donor chimerism for
evaluable patients at 6 and 12 months after HSCT).
Preparative Regimen and Azacitidine
Ninety patients were enrolled. Four never started the
conditioning because of death or serious infections, 10
patients died early (up to Day þ60), and 2 did not
respond to transplant. Of the 74 patients potentially eligible to receive azacitidine, 45 (60%) actually received it
and comprise the group described here. Reasons for never
receiving azacitidine were refusal (n ¼ 3), GVHD (n ¼
5), pancytopenia (n ¼ 6), elevated creatinine (n ¼ 4), and
infections (n ¼ 11). Patients received a total of 105 cycles
of azacitidine.
EFS and OS
Median follow-up was 20.5 months (range, 7.7-39.6
months). Nineteen (42%) patients had died at a median
of 30.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3
months-upper limit not estimable) (Fig. 1). Causes of
death included GVHD (n ¼ 3), pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage (n ¼ 1), and disease recurrence (n ¼
15). Nonrecurrence mortality rate was 9% (n ¼ 4).
Twenty-four (53%) patients had developed disease
recurrence. Seven recurrences occurred while on azacitidine: at 16 mg/m2 for 2 cycles (n ¼ 1, AML in CR3, second HSCT), 24 mg/m2 for 1 cycle (n ¼ 3, in first
recurrence), 32 mg/m2 for 1 cycle (n ¼ 2, primary induction failure and first recurrence), and 40 mg/m2 for 2
cycles (n ¼ 1, primary induction failure).
Twenty-eight patients (62%) died or developed disease recurrence. Median EFS was 18.2 months (95% CI,
11.9 months-upper limit not estimable) (Fig. 2). Cytogenetics or donor type did not affect EFS. There was,
however, a significant EFS difference favoring patients in

The fitted Bayesian model indicates that longer OS
was significantly associated with having fewer bone
marrow blasts, a smaller number of previous chemotherapies, fewer comorbidities, and more cycles of azacitidine (posterior probability .95 of a beneficial effect)
(Table 3). There was no significant association between
azacitidine dose and OS. Similar results were noted in the
EFS model (Table 4).

Acute and Chronic GVHD
Grade 2-3 and grade 3 acute GVHD rates were 27% and
9%, respectively. Because most GVHD started before
azacitidine initiation, and patients who developed severe
GVHD earlier were excluded, these results should be
interpreted with caution.
Eighteen (37%) of 43 patients at risk developed
chronic GVHD. The probability of developing chronic
GVHD decreased significantly with the number of azacitidine cycles, but was unaffected by dose (Table 5).

Toxicities and Infections
Median platelet count at the start of azacitidine was
113,000/mm3 (range, 16,000-302,000; lower quartile,
69,500), median white blood cell count was 5600/mm3
(range, 2800-18,000), and median ANC was 3000/mm3
(range, 1220-15,800). There was no correlation in this
relatively small series between white blood cell or platelet
count at the start of maintenance and development of
hematologic toxicities. Hematologic toxicities associated/
possibly associated with azacitidine included reversible
grade 1-2 or 3 thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 7 and n ¼ 2),

5426

which was documented more often with 32 mg/m2, and
in 1 of 2 patients receiving 40 mg/m2. Grade 1-2 neutropenia was documented in 7 cases.
Other toxicities included grade 1 nausea (n ¼ 9),
grade 2 fatigue (n ¼ 6), grade 1-2 transaminases elevation
(n ¼ 3), pruritus (n ¼ 1), grade 1 confusion (n ¼ 2), grade
2 creatinine elevation (n ¼ 1), and oral ulcers (n ¼ 2).
There were 3 cases of possible ocular toxicity: conjunctival
erythema, retina hemorrhage with platelet count drop to
50,000/mm3 (possibly pre-existing), and papilledema.

administration of azacitidine, as a function of peradministration dose and number of cycles (probability of
toxicity). The design targeted a per-administration dose/
schedule combination having posterior mean probability
of toxicity closest to .30. Tables 6 and Table 8 show that,
in terms of proximity to the targeted mean probability of
toxicity of 0.30, 2 equally optimal safe combinations were
32 mg/m2 for 4 cycles, which had posterior mean probability of toxicity ¼ .26, and 40 mg/m2 for 3 cycles), which
had posterior mean probability of toxicity ¼ .34. The
dose 32 mg/m2 for 4 cycles combination was chosen
because of thrombocytopenia observed with 40 mg/m2.
Induction of DNA Hypomethylation
As shown in Figure 3, we were unable to detect any significant induction of global DNA hypomethylation.

DISCUSSION
Disease recurrence is a major cause of treatment failure
after transplant.22-26 Results of most therapies given to
treat recurrence are very poor. In view of this observation,
we proposed to evaluate post-transplant azacitidine as a
strategy for remission consolidation/maintenance.
We demonstrated that it is possible to administer
azacitidine early after allogeneic HSCT to the majority of
a group of high-risk AML/MDS patients. Approximately
60% of our cohort of heavily pretreated patients was able
to receive at least 1 cycle of the drug. Our study was
designed with only a maximum of 4 cycles because of the
logistics of a phase 1 trial, but there are no reasons to
believe we could not prolong the duration of treatment,
considering that longer exposure may be important with
hypomethylating agents. We used an innovative trial

Figure 3. Mononuclear cell DNA global methylation is shown

cycle; D, day of the administration cycle. Global hypomethylation induction was analyzed using the long interspersed
nuclear elements (LINE) bisulfite pyrosequencing assay. LINE
methylation was measured on Day 1 before therapy and on
Days 5 and 21 of therapy. (A) When all patients and dose
levels/schedules were analyzed, no evidence of induction of

design that allowed us to determine dose and schedule of
administration, overcoming a major limitation of traditional phase 1 studies that do not address the issue of
number of cycles that can be delivered with a given dose.
A maintenance of remission study does not provide
direct evidence of drug activity. However, direct substantiation of the antileukemia effectiveness of low-dose azacitidine has been reported.27 We have treated AML/MDS
patients relapsing after allogeneic HSCT with doses ranging from 16 to 40 mg/m2 for up to 2 years, and preliminary experience indicates a 20% long-term disease control
rate for patients with indolent recurrences, even without
the need for immunosuppression withdrawal.10
Given the timing of drug administration, we could
not determine whether there was any effect on acute
GVHD. However, the probability of developing chronic
GVHD may have been decreased with longer schedules of
azacitidine administration. This possible effect is intriguing and deserves further investigation.

There was no change in global DNA methylation
with therapy, which is in contrast to studies in patients
receiving standard-dose azacitidine.14 Others have been
unable to document a relationship between hypomethylation induction and disease response, however,28 and it is
possible that the potential therapeutic effects observed
here are not directly related to hypomethylation.
It has been shown by other authors that epigenetic
changes may lead to decreased expression of cancer testis
antigens in malignant cells.29-31 It seems reasonable to
hypothesize that DNA hypomethylating agents could
magnify the graft-versus-leukemia effect of allogeneic
HSCT by increasing the immunogenicity of cancer
cells through increased expression of tumor antigens.
Azacitidine and decitabine may also induce increased
FoxP3 expression and regulatory T lymphocyte generation, which could conceivably influence GVHD
incidence.32
As expected, EFS was negatively influenced by
disease burden, extent of prior treatment, and comorbidities. Longer schedules of azacitidine administration were
associated with prolongation of EFS and OS, even with a
median number of 2 cycles per patient. It is unlikely that
patient selection per se explains the results. Although we
excluded patients from receiving azacitidine for reasons
described here, the final study cohort consisted of patients
with a median age of 60 years, mostly with recurrent
disease, and who had received a median of 2 chemotherapy regimens before transplant, a poor prognosis
variable in the setting of refractory AML/MDS.33,34
Feasibility of maintenance therapy is likely higher
than documented here. We arbitrarily limited eligibility
for starting azacitidine to the first 2.5 months after
HSCT, a decision made because of logistic reasons only.
If patients are allowed to start the treatment in a more
flexible schedule during the first 40-100 days, a larger
fraction will be eligible to receive it. These findings
provide the basis for an ongoing randomized trial comparing azacitidine given for 1 year after HSCT versus no
maintenance.
In conclusion, azacitidine 32 mg/m2 daily for 5 days
in each of 4 30-day cycles is associated with acceptable
toxicities when given after HSCT. Our trial also suggested
that this treatment may prolong EFS and OS, and that
more cycles may be associated with greater benefit.
