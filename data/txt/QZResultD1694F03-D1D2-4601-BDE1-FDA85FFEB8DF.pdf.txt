Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients With Newly
Diagnosed Breast Cancer
A Review of the Literature
Melissa Pilewskie, MD; and Tari A. King, MD

The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer remains controversial. Here we review
the current use of breast MRI and the impact of MRI on short-term surgical outcomes and rates of local recurrence. In addition, we
address the use of MRI in specific patient populations, such as those with ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive lobular carcinoma, and
occult primary breast cancer, and discuss the potential role of MRI for assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Although
MRI has improved sensitivity compared with conventional imaging, this has not translated into improved short-term surgical outcomes or long-term patient benefit, such as improved local control or survival, in any patient population. MRI is an important diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients presenting with occult primary breast cancer and has shown promise in monitoring response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy; however, the data do not support the routine use of perioperative MRI in patients with newly diagnosed

INTRODUCTION
The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer requires balancing the positive and negative aspects of additional imaging and, as evidenced by the growing number of editorials and reviews arguing
for or against the routine use of MRI,1-8 remains an area of significant controversy. This debate has been fueled by inconsistent data largely comprised of small, single-institution retrospective studies, although 2 randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) and several meta-analyses have provided more robust data evaluating MRI in the perioperative setting. The “pros”
of perioperative MRI include improved sensitivity compared with conventional imaging and therefore increased identification of multifocal, multicentric, or contralateral disease. With improved sensitivity comes a theoretical improvement in
short-term surgical management and/or long-term outcomes. The “cons” of perioperative MRI include the high falsepositive rate, potential treatment delays, increased mastectomy rates and cost, and, some argue, overdiagnosis and overtreatment of MRI-only detected disease. Here we review the relevant data regarding MRI use in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, examining both the short-term and long-term outcomes, MRI use in populations of women with
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), MRI’s role in patients presenting with occult primary breast cancer, and MRI’s ability to evaluate neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response.
Current MRI Use

In contrast to the well-established guidelines for MRI screening in patients with an inherited predisposition to breast cancer,9 to our knowledge, there are no guidelines for MRI use in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer; nevertheless, a
report from Western Washington State’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry demonstrated that
27% of 9196 women with breast cancer underwent MRI for staging or treatment planning between 2002 and 2009,10
and by 2009, 46% of women underwent perioperative breast MRI. MRI use varied significantly based on age, with 45%
of women aged 18 years to 40 years undergoing an MRI compared with 10% of those aged  81 years (P < .001). Patients
were also more likely to undergo MRI if they had commercial health care plans, lived in an urban area, lacked medical

comorbidities, or had stage I to III breast cancer, lobular
histology, or hormone receptor-negative tumors. The
association between MRI use, young patient age, and hormone receptor-negative cancer may be attributable to the
presence of known or suspected BRCA mutation carriers
in the population; however, this information is not available in the SEER registry. Breslin et al reported an even
higher rate of use of advanced imaging, with 53% of
patients with non-stage IV breast cancer aged < 65 years
undergoing breast MRI in 2008. In this cohort of 52,202
women, MRI use increased annually from 2005 to 2008
for women with both invasive and in situ carcinoma.11
Studies examining MRI use in older patients have
reported an overall MRI receipt rate of 7% to 10% among
women aged  65 years,12-14 with significant variation
based on geographic location and chronologic year
(P < .01). Wang et al found that by 2007, 27% of women
in the SEER-Medicare database with stage 0 to II breast
cancer had undergone a perioperative MRI13 and, as in
younger patients, preoperative MRI was found to increase
mastectomy rates among older patients,14 many of whom
likely would have been good candidates for breastconserving surgery (BCS) and anti-estrogen therapy
alone.15
A survey sent to the membership of the American
Society of Breast Surgeons in 2010 sought to evaluate
indications and practice patterns for MRI use among
treating physicians. Of 1034 respondents, 41% reported
routinely (> 75% of the time) recommending breast MRI
to patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.16 Variation in the recommendation for MRI was noted with
respect to both physician and patient factors, with academic surgeons less likely to obtain an MRI compared
with private practice surgeons (P 5 .01). Routine recommendation for MRI was more frequent for women with a
strong family history of breast cancer (73%), those with
ILC (69%), in women undergoing BCS (47%), and in
those with increased mammographic breast density
(88%). Although physician perception is that MRI is particularly beneficial in the setting of dense breast tissue,
studies have demonstrated no significant difference in the
diagnostic yield, sensitivity, or negative predictive value of
MRI according to breast density.17 Similarly, studies
examining the value of MRI in women with lobular cancers have generated conflicting results.
MRI for Treatment Selection

The increased sensitivity of MRI for the detection of multifocal or multicentric disease has been widely reported
and summarized in a meta-analysis by Houssami et al,18
Cancer

which included 2610 patients with breast cancer who
underwent perioperative MRI in addition to conventional
imaging. MRI identified additional disease in 16% of
patients (range, 6%-34% in individual studies), resulting
in a change from wide local excision to mastectomy in
8.1% of women (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9%11.3%) and a larger local excision in 11.3% of women
(95% CI, 6.8%-18.3%). A more recent meta-analysis by
Plana et al included 10,811 women from 50 studies and
found very similar results, with additional lesions identified by MRI in 20% of cases (range, 6%-71%).19
Although data consistently demonstrate an increased
detection rate of multifocal and multicentric disease, to
our knowledge, there are few data demonstrating
improved outcomes based on the treatment of MRI-only
detected disease. Therefore, the value of MRI in selecting
local therapy remains elusive.
MRI and Short-Term Surgical Outcomes

Proponents of breast MRI argue that MRI better characterizes tumor extent and, as such, should improve surgical
planning and decrease the rate of positive surgical resection margins and, therefore, the need for re-excision.
However, studies have demonstrated significant variability in tumor size estimation by MRI, with underestimation
reported in 8% to 59% of cases and overestimation in
11% to 70% of cases.20-24
Two prospective RCTs evaluated the effect of MRI
on re-operation rates (both re-excision and conversion to
mastectomy) in patients deemed appropriate for
BCS.25,26 The COMICE (Comparative Effectiveness of
MRI in Breast Cancer) trial multicenter collaboration
included 1625 women randomized to either perioperative
MRI or no additional imaging between 2002 and 2007.
There was no difference noted with regard to the primary
endpoint of re-operation rate, which was 19% in both the
MRI and the no-MRI groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.96;
95% CI, 0.75-1.24 [P 5 .77]), despite the finding that 5
times as many patients in the MRI group (n 5 58) converted to mastectomy before an initial attempt at BCS
compared with the no-MRI group (n 5 10). Among those
who underwent an initial mastectomy in the MRI group,
in 28% of patients (16 of 58 patients) it was considered
pathologically unnecessary.26
Similarly, the MONET (MR mammography of
non-palpable breast tumours) trial randomized 418
women with nonpalpable lesions, classified as Breast
Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3 to BIRADS 5 and detected on mammogram or ultrasound, to
biopsy or the addition of MRI before biopsy. In total, 163

malignant lesions were identified (83 in the MRI group
and 80 in the no-MRI group). It is interesting to note that
there was an increased re-excision rate for positive surgical
resection margins after BCS in the MRI group (34%)
compared with the no-MRI group (12%) (P 5 .008), and
no difference was noted in the rate of conversion to mastectomy after attempted BCS in the MRI (11%) and noMRI (14%) groups (P 5 .49).25
A meta-analysis that included 3112 patients with
breast cancer from the randomized MONET and COMICE trials, as well as 7 comparative cohort studies, evaluated surgical outcomes with the addition of breast MRI
and found no difference in re-excision rates after an initial
attempt at BCS based on the use of MRI (11.6% vs
11.4%; P 5 .87). However, the use of MRI was found to
significantly increase both the initial and overall mastectomy rates (16.4% and 25.5%, respectively) compared
with the no-MRI group (8.1% and 18.2%, respectively),
and this difference persisted after adjusting for age (initial
mastectomy-adjusted OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.03-4.61
[P < .001]; overall mastectomy-adjusted OR, 1.51; 95%
CI, 1.21-1.89 [P < .001]).27 In addition to a lack of
improvement in re-excision rates and an increase in mastectomy rates, studies have also reported an increased use
of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in women
undergoing perioperative MRI.28-30 On multivariate
analysis, both King et al28 and Sorbero et al29 found MRI
imaging to be a significant predictor of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (ORs of 2.8 and 2.04, respectively).
Collectively, available data have failed to support
MRI use for the goal of improving surgical management,
and the increased rates of both unilateral and bilateral
mastectomy in women undergoing perioperative MRI are
2082

concerning when considering the low rates of ipsilateral
breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and contralateral breast
cancer (CBC) in the modern era.
MRI and Long-Term Outcomes: IBTR

Although breast cancer assessed by mammogram and clinical examination is found to be unicentric in > 90% of
cases,31 serial sectioning of mastectomy specimens demonstrates that 21% to 63% of clinically and mammographically detected unicentric tumors are actually
multifocal or multicentric.32-38 As such, a large percentage
of patients treated with BCS will have microscopic residual disease in the breast, yet multiple prospective RCTs
and the updated Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group overview continue to demonstrate equivalent
survival between patients undergoing BCS and mastectomy,39-41 and IBTR rates have substantially decreased
over time.42,43
To the best of our knowledge, the only randomized
controlled data evaluating the impact of MRI on recurrence rates come from short-term follow-up in the COMICE trial, in which rates of local recurrence (LR) were
assessed as a secondary endpoint. At 3 years, local
recurrence-free interval rates of 94% and 96% were
reported for the MRI and no-MRI groups, respectively.44
Several retrospective single-institution series have
compared LR outcomes in women imaged with and without MRI (Table 1).45-50 Only the study by Fischer et al45
reported a lower IBTR rate in women undergoing MRI.
This study compared 121 patients with breast cancer who
underwent a perioperative MRI with 225 patients who
did not. At a mean follow-up of 40 months, the MRI
group had an IBTR rate of 1.2% compared with 6.5% in

the no-MRI group (P < .001). However, these results are
difficult to interpret both because of the high rate of
IBTR observed in the no-MRI group (nearly 7% at
just > 3 years) and because statistical adjustments were
not performed to control for differences between both
groups. The MRI group had a higher percentage of small
(T1) lymph node-negative tumors and fewer high-grade
lesions, and, paradoxically, a higher percentage of patients
in the MRI group received chemotherapy, all of which
may have impacted IBTR rates. The 5 subsequent studies
shown in Table 1 failed to find a significant improvement
in IBTR rates with the addition of MRI when controlling
for patient and tumor factors, and all reported low (0.4%5.0%) rates of IBTR at 2 to 8 years of follow-up.46-50 A
recent individual-person data meta-analysis including
3169 women from 4 of the above-mentioned trials
reported no difference in 8-year LR-free survival (97% for
the MRI group vs 95% in the no-MRI group; P 5 .87) or
8-year distant recurrence-free survival (89% in the MRI
group and 93% in the no-MRI group; P 5 .37). On multivariable analysis, there was no association noted between
perioperative MRI and LR-free survival (hazard ratio for
MRI vs no-MRI, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.52-1.51 [P 5 .65]).51
The recognition that IBTR rates differ by breast cancer subtype and, notably, the significantly higher LR rates
reported among patients with triple-negative and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-amplified
breast cancers in the pre-trastuzumab era,52,53 combined
with ongoing controversy regarding the theoretic advantages of perioperative MRI, have led to an RCT supported
by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network
and the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology. The
objective of the trial is to assess the impact of MRI on reoperation rates, LR, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness
in women with triple-negative and HER2-amplified
breast cancer. Although this study may provide useful information in the cohort of patients with triple-negative
breast cancer, the RCTs of adjuvant trastuzumab demonstrated significantly lower IBTR rates with the addition of
trastuzumab,54 and the low IBTR and CBC rates noted

among patients with HER2-amplified cancers in more
modern series will likely limit the impact of MRI among
patients with HER2-amplified cancer.55,56
MRI and Long-Term Outcomes: CBC

MRI has the potential to decrease metachronous CBC rates
through the identification of otherwise occult contralateral
disease. Table 2 summarizes 4 retrospective studies that have
compared rates of metachronous CBC in women imaged
with and without MRI at the time of their index breast cancer diagnosis.45,46,49,57 Criticisms of the study by Fischer
et al45 have been mentioned previously. Overall, CBC development rates were low (0.5%-6.0%) in both groups. It is
important to note that the 2 studies reporting a significant
difference in CBC rates both found an absolute difference of
1% to 2% in the MRI and no-MRI groups.45,57
A meta-analysis by Brennan et al58 evaluating the
rate of CBC detection by MRI among 3253 women presenting with unilateral cancer reported that 4.1% of
patients were diagnosed with a synchronous CBC based
on MRI. In comparison, a SEER population-based study
from 1973 to 1996 reported the actuarial 10-year risk of
metachronous CBC in women treated for unilateral stage
0 to stage II breast cancer to be 6.1%,59 and more recent
studies have demonstrated that CBC incidence has been
decreasing by approximately 3% per year since 1985.60
Together, these data suggest that either a single MRI at
the time of breast cancer diagnosis will identify the majority of breast cancers that will develop over time or, conversely, that many MRI-detected contralateral cancers will
be adequately treated as a by-product of appropriate systemic therapy for the index cancer and would remain clinically irrelevant.39
MRI and Long-Term Outcomes: Survival

The Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group
overview established that there is an important relationship between local control and survival in patients with
breast cancer; however, as systemic therapies continue to
improve, substantially larger differences in local control

will likely be needed to impact survival. Although, to the
best of our knowledge, there are no prospective or RCT
data evaluating the impact of MRI on survival in patients
with breast cancer, in consideration of the aforementioned
studies demonstrating little or no impact on LR, it is not
expected that MRI would have an impact on breast cancerrelated survival. Unsurprisingly, retrospective reports by
Solin et al,46 Shin et al,48 and Ko et al49 found no improvement in survival for women imaged with MRI compared
with those who underwent conventional imaging alone.
MRI in Select Patient Populations: DCIS

Surgical outcomes, including rates of re-excision and conversion to mastectomy, in women with DCIS imaged
with and without MRI have been reported in 5 retrospective single-institution studies (Table 3).61-65 MRI did not
appear to significantly decrease positive surgical resection
margin or re-excision rates for women undergoing BCS in
any series, yet mastectomy rates were only found to be
increased in 2 of 6 studies.62,63
Pilewskie et al compared the long-term locoregional
recurrence (LRR) rates and CBC rates among 2321
women with DCIS who were treated with BCS with and
without perioperative MRI.66 Similar to the data for invasive carcinoma, there was no association noted between
MRI use and improved outcomes. Eight-year rates of
LRR did not significantly differ (14.6% in the MRI group
vs 10.2% in the no-MRI group; P 5 .52), nor did rates of
CBC development (3.5% in the MRI group vs 5% in the
no-MRI group; P 5 .86). On multivariate analysis, there
was no association noted between MRI use and improved
LRR (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.79-1.78 [P 5 .42]).
Because women forgoing radiotherapy may derive the
greatest benefit from the addition of MRI, a cohort of 904
women treated with BCS and no adjuvant radiotherapy
2084

was analyzed separately. Again, no difference was noted in
the 8-year LRR rates between the MRI and no-MRI
groups (P 5 .33).66
MRI in Select Patient Populations: ILC

A review of 18 studies examining MRI use in women with
ILC found that MRI detected additional disease in 32%
of cases (95% CI, 22%-44%) and resulted in a subsequent
change in surgical management in 28% of women.67
Three retrospective studies to date have examined the
effect of perioperative MRI on surgical outcomes in
women with ILC and have reported conflicting findings
(Table 4).68-70 Mann et al68 reported a significant
decrease in the re-excision rate in the MRI group (5%)
compared with the no-MRI group (15%) (OR, 3.29;
95% CI, 1.22-8.85 [P 5 .01]), as well as a nonsignificant
trend toward a lower overall mastectomy rate in the MRI
group (48% vs 59%, respectively; P 5 .098).
Conversely, studies by Heil et al69 and McGhan
70
et al found no significant decrease in re-excision rates
and a nonsignificant trend toward higher mastectomy
rates in women imaged with MRI. The previously mentioned meta-analysis by Houssami et al analyzed women
with ILC separately and found a nonsignificant trend toward decreased re-excision rates in those women imaged
with MRI (adjusted OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.29-1.09
[P 5 .09]) at the expense of an increased age-adjusted
mastectomy rate with MRI (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.042.59 [P 5 .034]).27

MRI has become a standard imaging tool and is able to
identify a primary breast lesion in > 67% of cases.72 A
negative MRI also provides reassurance that a large tumor
burden is unlikely and that the patient may be safely
treated with axillary lymph node dissection, whole-breast
radiotherapy, and appropriate systemic therapy.
In a meta-analysis of 8 retrospective studies,72 which
included 220 women with occult primary breast cancer,
MRI identified a suspicious breast lesion in 72% of cases,
with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 31%. The
mean pathologic tumor size ranged from 5 mm to 16
mm, and > 90% were invasive carcinomas. When MRI
identified an occult breast lesion in patients without metastatic disease, 21% to 60% of patients were able to
undergo successful BCS.
MRI for Problem Solving

Similar to patients with an occult primary breast cancer,
women with Paget disease or abnormal physical examination findings and negative conventional imaging may
benefit from the addition of MRI for disease localization.
Paget disease, which is characterized by nipple erythema,
erosion, or ulceration caused by epidermal infiltration of
malignant cells, is associated with an underlying breast
malignancy in > 90% of cases, yet mammographic imaging may be normal in up to 50% of patients.73 Morrogh
et al74 reviewed imaging and pathology data on 34 women
with Paget disease who were treated at a single institution
and 94% were found to have an underlying carcinoma.
Mammography detected the underlying malignancy in
22% of cases, and supplemental MRI performed among 8
women with a negative mammogram demonstrated the
underlying malignancy in 4 cases (50%).
MRI Imaging in the NAC Setting

NAC is being used with increasing enthusiasm to convert patients requiring an upfront mastectomy to BCS
as well as to assess the impact of treatment on rates of
Cancer

pathologic complete response (pCR).75 Multiple studies
have evaluated the ability of MRI to predict response to
NAC. In the American College of Radiology Imaging
Network 6657 study, part of the I-SPY 1 trial, MRI
was obtained at 4 time points: before the initiation of
chemotherapy, after the first cycle, between the
anthracycline-based regimen and taxane therapies, and
at the conclusion of NAC before surgery. Compared
with clinical examination, MRI was found to be a stronger predictor of both pCR and residual cancer burden,
with tumor volume change measured at the time of the
second MRI being the strongest predictor.76 However,
from a clinical standpoint, the comparison of MRI with
physical examination is not particularly relevant, and a
more practical comparison is that between MRI and
conventional breast imaging.
A meta-analysis of 2050 women from 44 NAC
studies conducted between 1980 and 2008 reported that
MRI correctly identified residual disease with a median
sensitivity of 0.92. However, the ability of MRI to correctly identify patients who achieved a pCR in the current analysis was limited, with a median specificity of
0.60, and, expectedly, the accuracy of MRI for predicting pCR varied based on the pCR definition used. MRI
was found to have a higher accuracy than mammography
(P 5 .02), but no difference was noted between MRI and
ultrasound accuracy for the identification of a pCR
(P 5 .15).77 Similarly, a multicenter retrospective collaboration from the Translational Breast Cancer
Research Consortium (TBCRC 017), which included
746 patients treated from 2002 through 2011, reported
an overall accuracy rate of 74% of MRI for predicting a
pCR. Given this study’s more recent timeframe, information regarding hormone receptor and HER2 status
was available, and the authors demonstrated that MRI
had the highest negative predictive value in patients with
triple-negative and HER2-amplified tumors (60% and
62%, respectively).78

Although prediction of pCR is an important endpoint for therapeutic monitoring, it is not an absolute
endpoint for the ability to perform lesser surgery as
women with a partial response may still be good candidates for conversion to BCS after NAC. Data from the ISPY 1 trial were analyzed to assess a “clinically meaningful
tumor reduction,” defined as a change in tumor size
from > 4 cm to  4 cm after NAC, as a surrogate for
patients who may become candidates for BCS. Of 174
women with an initial tumor size of > 4 cm, 81% had a
pathologic tumor size of  4 cm after NAC, 37% of
2086

whom were successfully treated with BCS. In 38% of the
total study population, there was a discrepancy of  2 cm
between post-NAC MRI measurements and final pathologic tumor size. In this study, MRI accuracy also was
found to differ by tumor pattern and receptor subtype,
with improved performance noted among patients with
breast cancer subtypes that are known to have higher pCR
rates.79 A meta-analysis by Marinovich et al compared the
agreement in tumor size between different imaging
modalities and final pathology after NAC in 958 patients
from 19 studies.80 MRI and ultrasound were found to

have similar overestimations of tumor size (mean differences of 0.1 cm), whereas MRI had a lower overestimation
of tumor size than mammography (mean difference of 0.4
cm). Although the pooled mean difference between MRI
and final pathology was 0.1 cm, the 95% limits of agreement ranged from 24.2 cm to 4.4 cm, which is a clinically significant margin of error when planning surgical
therapy.80
The wide margin of error in MRI estimations of
post-NAC tumor response and size is likely related to
both tumor subtype and treatment regimen, and requires
further investigation. Important unanswered questions
relate to the ability to predict successful BCS after NAC,
which likely relates to the pattern of tumor response (concentric vs multicentric) (Figure 1). Given the increased
cost of MRI, a direct comparison of MRI with conventional imaging in this setting may be prudent. Although
the use of MRI for planning BCS after NAC is an area of
future research, if a patient is known upfront to require
mastectomy after NAC, such as individuals with extensive
multicentric or inflammatory disease, post-treatment
MRI is not indicated.
Conclusions

The available literature does not appear to support the
routine use of MRI for the evaluation of patients with
newly diagnosed breast cancer. Data from RCTs and several retrospective series have failed to demonstrate an
improvement in short-term surgical outcomes, and studies have consistently demonstrated increasing mastectomy
rates with the addition of MRI. Data supporting
improved long-term outcomes with the addition of perioperative breast MRI, including IBTR, CBC development, and survival, are also lacking. Multiple series
demonstrating increasing trends in MRI use without a
benefit in surgical or long-term outcomes require a reevaluation of practice patterns. Although there are clinical
situations in which MRI can provide valuable information, such as in patients with occult primary breast cancer
and, potentially, in monitoring response to NAC, the
increasing costs of advanced imaging in patients with cancer81 highlight the need for clinicians to critically evaluate
the literature and focus on spending health care dollars in
an evidence-based manner.
