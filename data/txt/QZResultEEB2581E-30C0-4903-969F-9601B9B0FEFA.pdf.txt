with a high risk of metastases that may only become clinically
apparent many years after initial diagnosis (1). ASPL-TFE3–positive
renal carcinomas form a small proportion of adult renal
carcinomas but are overrepresented in children and young adults;
given their very recent description, their long-term clinical course
remains unclear at this time but metastases have been reported (2).
ASPL-TFE3 renal carcinomas represent just one of several subtypes
of renal carcinoma characterized by translocations involving TFE3.
These include PRCC-TFE3 (3–5), PSF-TFE3, and NONO-TFE3 (6),
among others, and together they make up a distinctive type of renal
carcinoma recently designated translocation carcinomas of the
kidney (7). These renal cancers are now being increasingly
recognized in adults as well (8).
TFE3 is a member of the microphthalmia-TFE basic helix-loophelix leucine zipper transcription factor subfamily. The normal
cellular role of ASPL (ASPSCR1) remains to be fully elucidated but
it may function at least in part as a regulator of intracellular
trafficking of the GLUT4 glucose transporter (9). The ASPL-TFE3
fusion replaces the NH2-terminal portion of TFE3 by ASPL
sequences while retaining the TFE3 DNA-binding region, activation
domain, and nuclear localization signal (1). The ASPL-TFE3 fusion
protein functions as a stronger transactivator compared with
native TFE3 at several promoters (10). These findings suggest that
inappropriate target gene transactivation by ASPL-TFE3 may
contribute to its oncogenic properties in ASPL-TFE3–associated
tumors. Other TFE3 fusion proteins have also been shown to
function as aberrant transcription factors (11, 12).
Here, we provide evidence that ASPL-TFE3–mediated direct
transcriptional up-regulation of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase
triggers dramatic activation of downstream signaling pathways.
The depletion of MET by RNA interference or its functional
inhibition by the selective inhibitor PHA665752 abolishes HGFstimulated signaling pathways, leading to loss of various tumorigenic phenotypes in ASPL-TFE3–associated renal carcinoma cells,
including cell proliferation, adhesion, cell motility, and Matrigel
invasion. We also provide evidence supporting a similar role for
other TFE3 fusion proteins. These findings point to an important
role for MET in the pathobiology of human cancers with TFE3
fusions and highlight MET as a more tractable therapeutic target in
these cancers than the fusion proteins themselves.

Abstract
Specific chromosomal translocations encoding chimeric transcription factors are considered to play crucial oncogenic
roles in a variety of human cancers but the fusion proteins
themselves seldom represent suitable therapeutic targets.
Oncogenic TFE3 fusion proteins define a subset of pediatric
renal adenocarcinomas and one fusion (ASPL-TFE3) is also
characteristic of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). By
expression profiling, we identified the MET receptor tyrosine
kinase gene as significantly overexpressed in ASPS relative to
four other types of primitive sarcomas. We therefore examined
MET as a direct transcriptional target of ASPL-TFE3. ASPLTFE3 binds to the MET promoter and strongly activates it.
Likewise, PSF-TFE3 and NONO-TFE3 also bind this promoter.
Induction of MET by ASPL-TFE3 results in strong MET
autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling
in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In cancer
cell lines containing endogenous TFE3 fusion proteins,
inhibiting MET by RNA interference or by the inhibitor
PHA665752 abolishes HGF-dependent MET activation, causing
decreased cell growth and loss of HGF-dependent phenotypes.
MET is thus a potential therapeutic target in these cancers.
Aberrant transcriptional up-regulation of MET by oncogenic
TFE3 fusion proteins represents another mechanism by which
certain cancers become dependent on MET signaling. The
identification of kinase signaling pathways transcriptionally
up-regulated by oncogenic fusion proteins may reveal more
accessible therapeutic targets in this class of human cancers.

Introduction
The ASPL-TFE3 fusion arising from a t(X;17)(p11.2;q25.3)
characterizes two distinct human cancers, alveolar soft part
sarcoma (ASPS), where it is present in all cases, as well as a newly
defined subset of pediatric renal adenocarcinomas (1, 2). ASPS is an
uncommon chemoresistant sarcoma typically presenting as an
extremity tumor in an adolescent or young adult; it is associated

amplified with MET promoter primers (5¶-TTCTGCGGTGCCCAAATCTCT-3¶
and 5¶-TGTCTGTCTGCCTCGCGTGCTGTC-3¶) or control downstream primers (5¶-GAACGTAAAATGTGTCGCTC-3¶ and 5¶-CTCTGTCAGATAAGA AATTCCTTAG-3¶) with Advantage GC (Clontech, Mountain View, CA).

FU-UR-1 renal carcinoma (gift of Dr. M. Ishiguro, Fukuoka University School
of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan; ref. 16), and the renal carcinoma lines UOK109
and UOK145 (gift of Dr. M. Linehan, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,
MD; ref. 6). Cell culture conditions are provided in Supplementary Methods.
To establish ASPL-TFE3 inducible cell lines, T-Rex 293 cells (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) were transfected with DNA of pcDNA4/TO/myc-His, ASPLTFE3 type 1/TO, or ASPL-TFE3 type 2/TO. After 48 h, the cells were treated
with 0.2 mg/mL zeocin (Invitrogen), and drug-resistant colonies were
isolated. The expression of ASPL-TFE3 was induced by 1 Ag/mL tetracycline
(Invitrogen).

Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 Ag total RNA by SuperScript
II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) for MET was done using iCycler (Bio-Rad, CA). The amounts of
the various target genes and TATA-box binding protein (TBP) gene as an
endogenous control were quantified by standard curves obtained from
serial dilutions of standard plasmids. The sequences for primers and probes
were as follows: c-MET forward primer, 5¶-CATGCCGACAAGTGCAGTA;
c-MET reverse primer, 5¶-TCTTGCCATCATTGTCCAAC; c-MET probe,
CCAGGCAGTGCAGCATGTAGTGAT; TBP forward primer, 5¶-GCATATTTTCTTGCTGCCAGTCT; TBP reverse primer, 5¶-ACCACGGCACTGATTTTCAGTT; TBP probe, 5¶-ACTGTTCTTCACTCTCTTGGCTCCTGTGCA.
Standard plasmids were generated by cloning cDNA fragments of MET
and TBP into the pCRII TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen).

Antibodies
MET (C-12 and C-28) and actin (I-19) antibodies were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); Gab1 antibody was from Upstate (Lake
Placid, NY). Antibodies against phosphorylated MET (Y1234/Y1235 and
Y1349), phosphorylated Gab1 (Y307), phosphorylated RAF (S338), mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphorylated MAPK (T202/Y204),
Akt and phosphorylated Akt (S473, 587F11), signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) and phosphorylated Stat3 (Y705), epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) and phosphorylated EGFR (Y845 and Y1068),
and phosphorylated myc (T58/S62) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA).
The antibody against Crk was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington,
KY); human HGF antibody was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); myc
antibody was from Invitrogen; Flag-M2 with or without horseradish
peroxidase was from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO).

MET Inhibition
Selective MET inhibitor. PHA665752 (kindly provided by J. Christensen,
Pfizer, Inc., La Jolla, CA; ref. 18) was dissolved in DMSO and used at the
concentrations described below.
RNA interference. For experiments with FU-UR-1 cells, small
interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting MET mRNA were obtained from
Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO) and used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. We used a pool of four MET-specific 21-nucleotide doublestranded RNA oligonucleotides each forming a 19-bp duplex core with
2-nucleotide 3¶ overhangs. MET siRNA duplexes were transiently transfected into FU-UR1 cells using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen).
The reagent used for transfection was added in MOCK cells, and negative
control cells were transfected by nonspecific control pool siRNA
(Dharmacon). For experiments with UOK109 and UOK145 cells, MET
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences (19) were isolated from the parental
pSuper vector by EcoRI and XhoI digestion and cloned into p(si)2-puro
(20). Cells were infected with retrovirus produced as described (20) and
selected with puromycin (2 Ag/mL).

Plasmids
cDNAs of ASPL-TFE3 type 1 or type 2 (1) and wild-type TFE3 were
amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA4-myc-His expression vector
(Invitrogen). The promoter region of MET was delineated using Gene2
Promoter software (Genomatix Software GmbH, Munich, Germany), and a
fragment extending 500 bp upstream from the transcription start site was
amplified by PCR and cloned into pGL3basic (Promega, Co., Madison, WI).
The expression plasmids for Ras V12 and Ras N19 were generous gifts from
Dr. S. Tanaka (Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan).

Protein Expression
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Western blotting and the
detection of protein-protein interactions by coimmunoprecipitation were
carried out using standard techniques, as described in Supplementary
Methods.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded whole sections or tissue microarray sections of ASPS and ASPL-TFE3 renal
carcinomas were immunostained with MET polyclonal antibody (C-28;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:3,000 dilution with EDTA pretreatment or
with HGF antibody (R&D Systems). Staining for MET and HGF in these
ASPL-TFE3–containing tumors was compared with that seen in tissue
microarray sections of other translocation-associated sarcomas, including
synovial sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and
desmoplastic small round cell tumor.

Measurement of Growth Rates

For FU-UR1 cells, 1  105 cells were seeded onto 60-mm-diameter plates
and were treated the following day with or without PHA665752, PD98059,
LY294002, and rapamycin at the doses indicated below. To assess cell
viability, the numbers of cells were counted at 4 days using a hemocytometer. The effects of PHA665752 and/or rapamycin on cell proliferation
were examined every other day for 10 days. For UOK109, colony counts were
done as described (20). For UOK145 cells, cells were fixed and stained with
crystal violet and then destained with 10% methanol/10% acetic acid and
the absorbance at 595 to 750 nm was measured to quantitate cell survival,
as described (20).

Luciferase Reporter Assay
The activation of the MET promoter construct was examined using the
Dual Luciferase Promoter Assay System (Promega), using standard
techniques, as described in Supplementary Methods.

Results
MET is highly differentially overexpressed in ASPS. We
performed expression profiling using the Affymetrix U133A chips
on 16 cases of surgically resected ASPS, all previously confirmed to
contain either the ASPL-TFE3 type 1 or type 2 chimeric transcript
(Fig. 1A). The global expression profile of the ASPS tumors was
compared with that of four other translocation-associated
sarcomas, including synovial sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, alveolar
rhabdomyosarcoma, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor. We
have observed that differentially expressed genes defined by
expression profiling of human cancers with chimeric transcription
factors provide an enriched source of candidate transcriptional
targets of these specific fusion oncoproteins (21). A similar

MET Promoter Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay for
ASPL-TFE3
This was done using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay
kit from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), as described in detail in
Supplementary Methods. ChIP-purified DNA was analyzed by PCR for the
presence of MET promoter sequences, by using the following primers:
forward, 5¶-CGCTTTGTGAGCAGATGCGG; reverse, 5¶-AGCGGCGCAAGGACCACACG.

MET Promoter ChIP Assays in UOK109 and UOK145 Cells
UOK109 and UOK145 chromatin were prepared as described (17):

Activation of MET Signaling by TFE3 Fusion Oncoproteins

Figure 1. The MET promoter is a direct target of ASPL-TFE3. A, ASPL-TFE3–mediated transactivation of MET promoter. 293T cells were transiently cotransfected
with the MET promoter reporter plasmid and the expression plasmid for native TFE3, or ASPL-TFE3 type 1 or type 2. MOCK cells were transfected with the
empty plasmid. The luciferase activities were normalized to that of cotransfected pRL-TK plasmid. Columns, mean from three independent experiments; bars, SD.
Statistical analyses were done by Student’s t test, and the luciferase results for ASPL-TFE3 type 1 or type 2 were significantly different from that of MOCK-transfected
cells at P < 0.01. The pGL3-basic reporter plasmid without MET promoter was used as negative control (left side ). The schematic structures of ASPL, TFE3, and
ASPL-TFE3 chimeric proteins (type 1 and type 2) are shown. Dotted line, the fusion points in the chimeric gene products. Numbers, amino acid residues. AD,
transcription activation domain. B, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were done to confirm the binding of ASPL-TFE3 to the MET promoter. MOCK, ASPL-TFE3
type 1– or type 2–inducible 293 cell lines were treated with 1 Ag/mL tetracycline for 46 h, and the cell lysates were treated as described in Materials and Methods.
PCR was done to detect the endogenous MET promoter sequences in chromatin-DNA complexes containing ASPL-TFE3. Lanes 1, 4, and 7, the amplification in
total input DNA before immunoprecipitation. Lanes 2, 5, and 8, PCR amplification in samples precipitated with normal mouse IgG as negative control. Lanes 3, 6, and 9,
the presence of MET promoter sequences in ASPL-TFE3–containing chromatin-DNA complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody. The expression levels
of ASPL-TFE3 after tetracycline treatment were examined by immunoblotting using anti-myc antibody. C, the relative expression of MET mRNA was analyzed by
quantitative PCR after ASPL-TFE3 induction in 293 cells, and this was normalized to that of the TBP control gene. The expression levels of ASPL-TFE3 after
tetracycline treatment were examined by immunoblot using anti-myc antibody. D, the MET promoter is also bound by other TFE3 fusion proteins. Chromatin
preparations isolated from UOK109 and UOK145 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-TFE3, TFEB, or MITF antibodies or a control antibody (anti-GST), subjected
to PCR with primers specific for the MET promoter or a region downstream of the MET promoter (control ) and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Input
chromatin, amplified unfractionated chromatin.

Figure 2. ASPL-TFE3–induced MET expression and its phosphorylation. A, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the expression plasmids for MOCK,
native TFE3, ASPL-TFE3 type 1, or ASPL-TFE3 type 2, and their expression levels were examined by immunoblotting (IB ) using anti-myc antibody. The expression
of MET and its phosphorylation at Y1234/Y1235 residues were analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Upper arrowhead in the MET immunoblot,
precursor MET; lower arrowhead, mature form of MET. B, the expression of MET and its phosphorylation at Y1234/1235 residues after ASPL-TFE3 induction were
examined by immunoblotting. ASPL-TFE3–inducible 293 cells were treated with 1 Ag/mL tetracycline for 24 or 48 h. Upper arrowhead, precursor MET; lower
arrowhead, mature form of MET.

the levels of MET mRNA were examined by real-time quantitative
RT-PCR. Induction of ASPL-TFE3 type 1 or its type 2 in 293 cells
was followed by a 3.5-fold elevation in the expression level of
the endogenous MET mRNA relative to that in MOCK cells
(Fig. 1C).
Other TFE3 fusion proteins also bind specifically to the MET
promoter. Given the activation of MET by ASPL-TFE3, we
hypothesized that other renal carcinoma–associated TFE3 fusions
may similarly act on the MET promoter. The renal carcinoma cell
lines UOK109 and UOK145 express the NONO-TFE3 and PSF-TFE3
translocation products, respectively (25). ChIP assays showed
reactivity with antibodies directed against TFE3 at the MET
promoter in both cell lines (Fig. 1D). Notably, both of these lines
fail to express detectable wild-type TFE3 (ref. 25; and data not
shown), supporting the interpretation that TFE3 fusion proteins
are occupying the endogenous MET promoter in these cells. In
addition, native TFEB seemed to be bound to the MET promoter
in UOK109 cells (Fig. 1D), a finding that is consistent with the
close biochemical similarity of TFEB to TFE3, as well as its role
as a translocated oncogene in other cases of childhood renal
carcinoma (26).
ASPL-TFE3 increases MET protein expression and phosphorylation. Next, we used multiple approaches to examine the
link between ASPL-TFE3 and the expression level and activation
state of MET protein. The transfection of ASPL-TFE3 expression
plasmid into 293 cells led to an increase in both MET precursor
protein (170 kDa) and its mature form (145 kDa; Fig. 2A,
arrowheads). To exclude a nonspecific effect of transient transfection on MET protein levels, we used 293 cells stably transfected
with an inducible ASPL-TFE3 construct to confirm its stimulation
of MET protein expression (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these findings,
FU-UR1 renal carcinoma cells that express the endogenous ASPLTFE3 fusion exhibit remarkably high expression of endogenous
MET protein compared with several other types of cancer cell lines,
including HeLa cervix adenocarcinoma, MCF7 breast cancer cells,
A673 Ewing sarcoma cells, and three independent synovial sarcoma
cell lines (SYO1, HS-SY-II, Fuji; see below; data not shown).
Finally, we used phosphorylation site–specific antibody to show

observation has been made in acute leukemias with chimeric
transcription factors (22). We have used this approach to identify
other direct transcriptional targets of ASPL-TFE3 (10).
Here, to identify ASPL-TFE3 transcriptional targets of potential
therapeutic interest, we focused on kinase genes specifically upregulated in ASPS relative to the other sarcomas listed above. We
identified 739 probe sets on the Affymetrix U133A chip
corresponding to 432 genes with kinase domains by searches of
the annotation database provided by Affymetrix and careful
curation based on comprehensive reviews (23, 24) and genome
database searches. We examined which kinase genes were most
differentially expressed in ASPS relative to the four other sarcomas.
This revealed that the MET receptor tyrosine kinase gene was
among the kinase genes most significantly overexpressed in ASPS
compared with the other sarcomas (Supplementary Table S1). The
relative fold change of MET and its P value by Student’s t test were
4.9 and 2.91  10 9, respectively. This was significant at P < 0.01
after Bonferroni correction (a method considerably more stringent
that the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate). Based on this
analysis, we chose to examine MET as a potential ASPL-TFE3 target
gene.
MET is a direct transcriptional target of ASPL-TFE3. In
standard cotransfection assays, exogenous ASPL-TFE3 type 1 or
type 2 fusion protein induced prominent transactivation of an
exogenous MET promoter construct in 293 cells, significantly
higher relative to that of native TFE3, especially in the case of
ASPL-TFE3 type 2 (Fig. 1A). This reporter was driven by a portion
of the MET promoter extending 500 bp upstream from its
transcription start site. CANNTG, the consensus binding sequence
for native TFE3, is also bound by ASPL-TFE3 fusion proteins (10).
Therefore, we used ChIP to examine whether ASPL-TFE3 localizes
to a portion of the MET promoter containing a CANNTG site
(CACGTG, f300 bp upstream from the MET transcription start
site) using 293 cells with inducible ASPL-TFE3 expression (T-Rex
system). This revealed that the myc-tagged ASPL-TFE3 type 1 or
type 2 fusion proteins were specifically present at the endogenous
MET promoter in 293 cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 9). To further
support ASPL-TFE3–mediated transactivation of MET promoter,

Activation of MET Signaling by TFE3 Fusion Oncoproteins

phosphorylation at tyrosine 1,349 in its cytoplasmic multipledocking site is known to provide a direct binding site for the Gab1
docking protein. Indeed, we were able to show that ASPL-TFE3
expression resulted in association of MET to Gab1 by immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 3A). In addition, phosphorylation at
tyrosine 307 of Gab1 was induced after ASPL-TFE3 expression
(Fig. 3B). Tyrosine 307 of Gab1 is one of the multiple binding sites
for various SH2 proteins, and, indeed, this was associated with the
recruitment of the adaptor protein Crk (Fig. 3B).
Examining more downstream phosphorylation targets in these
signaling pathways, we found that ASPL-TFE3 induced the
phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK (T202/Y204) and myc (T58/
S62) in 293 cells, although their total expression levels remained
constant (not shown for myc; Fig. 3C). Phosphorylation at these
sites increased at 48 h after ASPL-TFE3 induction compared with
24 h. As expected, the dominant negative form of Ras (Ras N19)
blocked ASPL-TFE3–induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK
(Fig. 3D, lanes 6 and 9). To examine the cell specificity of this ASPLTFE3–mediated activation of MAPK, three other cell lines, HeLa,
Cos7, and MCF7, were transfected with the expression plasmids for

that ASPL-TFE3–dependent induction of MET protein was
associated with MET autophosphorylation at tyrosine residues
1,234 and 1,235 in its catalytic domain (Fig. 2A and B). In contrast,
in this experiment, native TFE3 did not exhibit any effect on MET
protein expression and phosphorylation (Fig. 2A).
ASPL-TFE3 expression triggers assembly of MET/Gab1/Crk
complexes, activating downstream signaling. MET autophosphorylation at tyrosine residues 1,234 and 1,235 in the catalytic
domain is followed by additional phosphorylation events at Y1349
and Y1356 in its COOH-terminal multiple-docking site, an essential
step in the recruitment of downstream Gab1 (growth factor
receptor binding protein 2–associated binder 1) docking protein
(27). Once Gab1 is phosphorylated at multiple sites by activated
MET, it can recruit several downstream transducers such as the
p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), CrkII/CrkL,
PLC-g?, Shc, SHP-2, and SHIP, leading to a variety of biological
responses. Therefore, as ASPL-TFE3 expression induces MET
overexpression and autophosphorylation, we next examined
signaling downstream of MET in this context to better understand
the biological phenotypes of ASPL-TFE3–associated tumors. MET

Figure 3. ASPL-TFE3 recruits MET/Gab1/Crk complexes, activating the ERK and PI3K/Stat pathways. A, ASPL-TFE3–induced recruitment of Gab1 to phosphorylated
MET. MOCK-, ASPL-TFE3 type 1–, or ASPL-TFE3 type 2–inducible 293 cells were treated with 1 Ag/mL tetracycline for 24 or 48 h, and the expression levels of
ASPL-TFE3 were examined by immunoblot using anti-myc antibody. The phosphorylation at residue Y1349 of MET was analyzed by immunoprecipitation using
anti-MET antibody followed by immunoblotting with phosphorylated Y1349–specific MET antibody. To detect the association of MET and Gab1, the cell lysate was
immunoprecipitated with anti-Gab1 antibody, and subsequently MET bound to Gab1 was detected with anti-MET antibody. B, ASPL-TFE3–mediated Gab1/Crk
complexes. Tetracycline treatment of ASPL-TFE3–inducible 293 cells was done as described in (A ). The phosphorylation at the Y307 residue of Gab1 in
whole-cell lysates was analyzed by immunoblotting. The association of Crk and Gab1 was examined by immunoprecipitation using anti-Crk antibody followed by
immunoblotting with anti-Gab1 antibody. C, MOCK or ASPL-TFE3–inducible 293 cells were treated with 1 Ag/mL tetracycline for 24 or 48 h, and the expression levels
of ASPL-TFE3 were examined by immunoblot with anti-myc antibody. The phosphorylations of p42/44 MAPK (T202/Y204), myc (T58/S62), Akt (S473), and Stat3
(Y705) in whole-cell lysates were examined by immunoblotting with phosphorylation site–specific antibodies. The protein levels loaded in each well were confirmed
with anti-MAPK, anti-Stat3, and antiactin antibodies. D, Ras-dependent MAPK phosphorylation in ASPL-TFE3–induced 293 cells. 293T cells were transiently
transfected with the expression plasmids for ASPL-TFE3 type 1 or type 2 with or without the expression plasmids for dominant active form of Ras (Ras V12) or its
dominant negative form (Ras N19), as indicated. The expression levels of ASPL-TFE3 were examined by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibody. The phosphorylations
at T202/Y204 of MAPK were identified using specific antibodies.

PHA665752 was also effective in inhibiting HGF-triggered phosphorylation of downstream Gab1, Akt, and MAPK in a dosedependent manner, and, indeed, 1 Amol/L PHA665752 suppressed
phosphorylation at these sites quite potently (Fig. 4D). As expected,
50 Amol/L LY294002 completely inhibited HGF-dependent phosphorylation of Akt and Stat3, but did not affect Gab1 and MAPK
(Supplementary Fig. S1). However, contrary to our expectations,
PD98059 did not fully suppress HGF-dependent phosphorylation of
MAPK in FU-UR1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
MET inhibition by PHA665752 decreases cell viability and
proliferation of cells with endogenous ASPL-TFE3. To evaluate
the relationship between the expression levels of MET and the
effects of PHA665752 on cell viability, we used five different cell
lines expressing a variety of levels of endogenous MET protein.
Consistent with our microarray data on clinical samples with the
same fusion oncoproteins, FU-UR1 renal carcinoma cells (ASPLTFE3–positive) and RH30 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells (PAX3FKHR–positive) exhibited remarkably higher levels of MET than
A673 Ewing sarcoma cells (EWS-FLI1–positive) or the synovial
sarcoma cell lines, HS-SY-II (SYT-SSX1–positive) and Fuji (SYTSSX2–positive; Fig. 5A). The up-regulation of MET in alveolar
rhabdomyosarcomas has been previously reported (28).
PHA665752 decreased the viability of FU-UR1 cells in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5B). The IC50 of PHA665752 in this cell line
was 0.5 Amol/L, the lowest of the five cell lines tested. PD98059,
LY294002, and rapamycin also reduced the viability of FU-UR1 cells;
however, in contrast to the findings with PHA665752, for none
of these other compounds was FU-UR1 the most sensitive cell
line among these five lines (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Finally,
combining the two most active compounds, PHA665752 and
rapamycin, produced an additive effect on FU-UR1 cells, reducing
cell counts by f75% at 8 days (Supplementary Fig. S2B). A cooperative effect of PHA665752 and rapamycin has been reported in
other cancers (29).
MET knockdown decreases viability and proliferation of
cells with other TFE3 fusions. To examine whether MET is also
playing a similar role in cells containing other TFE3 fusions, we
depleted MET in the UOK109 and UOK145 renal carcinoma cell
lines using a shRNA (Fig. 5C) that was delivered by either
transfection or retroviral infection. Whereas control cells (HeLa)
were unaffected by MET shRNA (not shown), MET knockdown
potently decreased UOK109 and UOK145 cell viability (Fig. 5D).
MET depletion inhibits HGF-mediated phenotypes in cells
with endogenous ASPL-TFE3. HGF/MET signaling is known to
play important roles in cell adhesion, motility, and invasion,
processes that may be determinants of metastatic potential and
poor prognosis (reviewed in refs. 30, 31). HGF stimulation of FU-UR1
cells dramatically increased cell adhesion on extracellular matrix
proteins such as collagen IV, fibronectin, and laminin/fibronectin
(Supplementary Fig. S3A ). The depletion of MET by RNA
interference completely abrogated the HGF-triggered enhancement
of cell adhesion (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Wound-healing assays
(32) were done to evaluate the scattering and motility of FU-UR1
cells. In the absence of HGF, the cell motility after wound formation
was almost equal between MOCK-, control siRNA–, and MET siRNA–
transfected cells, although a slight decrease was observed in MET
siRNA–transfected cells after 16 h (Supplementary Fig. S3B). HGF
stimulation led to remarkable cell scattering and induced more than
twice higher cell motility compared with that without HGF
in MOCK- or control siRNA–transfected cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). However, MET-depleted cells failed to dissociate from

native TFE3, ASPL-TFE3 type 1, or ASPL-TFE3 type 2. ASPL-TFE3
induced phosphorylation of MAPK in HeLa and 293 cells, but no
change in MAPK phosphorylation could be detected in Cos7 and
MCF7 cells, possibly due the high basal phosphorylation levels in
these two cell lines (not shown).
Regarding the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, we found that Akt
and Stat3 were also phosphorylated at serine 473 and tyrosine 705,
respectively, upon ASPL-TFE3 induction in 293 cells (Fig. 3C). In
contrast, the phosphorylation of p90 RSK, Elk, MAPKAPK-2, and
HSP27, all mainly related to the p38 MAPK pathway, were
unresponsive to the expression of ASPL-TFE3 in its inducible 293
cells (data not shown).
Activation of MET signaling pathways in tumors with TFE3
fusions. To support the relevance of these data to human tumors
in vivo, we confirmed that MET is detectable by both immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4A) and immunoblotting (Fig. 4B) in most ASPLTFE3–positive clinical tumor samples. In addition, the expression
levels of HGF in these tumors were also remarkably high (Fig. 4A
and B). In contrast, we did not detect HGF expression in most
other translocation-associated sarcomas by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). Thus, among the sarcomas tested,
coexpression of MET and its ligand, HGF, was by far most frequent
and most striking in ASPS.
Examining the in vivo activation status of signaling mediators
downstream of MET by immunoblotting, we found that the high
expression of MET in ASPS tumors and ASPL-TFE3–positive or
PRCC-TFE3–positive renal carcinomas was associated with phosphorylation of Akt and p44/42 MAPK, at S473 and T202/Y204,
respectively (Fig. 4B). MET expression level, phosphorylation, and
activation of downstream mediators in these tumors containing
TFE3 fusions was generally comparable with that observed in eight
papillary renal cell carcinomas (a subtype characterized by
activating MET mutations; not shown).
Consistent with the data from exogenous ASPL-TFE3 in
heterologous cells and from clinical tumor samples, we observed
that FU-UR1 cells display, in the presence of HGF, prominent
phosphorylation of MET in the catalytic domain and multipledocking site, the recruitment of Crk to phosphorylated Gab1,
leading to strong phosphorylation of downstream transducers such
as Raf-1 (S338), p44/42 MAPK (T202/Y204), Akt (S473), and Stat3
(Y705; Fig. 4C).
Effects of MET knockdown on MET-mediated signaling
pathways in cells with endogenous ASPL-TFE3. To evaluate
MET as a potential therapeutic target in ASPL-TFE3–associated
tumors, we first used RNA interference to knock down MET. RNA
interference using siRNA transfections resulted in almost complete
depletion of MET protein in FU-UR1 cells (Fig. 4C), which
completely abolished HGF-dependent phosphorylation of MET at
Y1234/Y1235 and Y1349 and of downstream transducers such as
Gab1 at Y307, p42/44 MAPK at T202/Y204, Akt at S473, and Stat3 at
Y705 (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the loss of Gab1 phosphorylation,
the HGF-dependent association of Crk to Gab1 was also abolished
(Fig. 4C).
Effects of PHA665752 on MET-mediated signaling pathways
in cells with endogenous ASPL-TFE3. As a complementary
approach to validate MET as a potential therapeutic target in
human cancers with TFE3 fusions, we examined the effects of the
selective MET inhibitor PHA665752 (18). As little as 0.5 Amol/L
PHA665752 dramatically suppressed HGF-dependent MET phosphorylation at Y1234/Y1235 in FU-UR1 cells, and 1 Amol/L of this
compound abolished it completely (Fig. 4D ). Furthermore,

the elimination of MET by RNA interference dramatically inhibited

Discussion

a large set of human sarcomas allowed us to identify the MET gene
as significantly overexpressed in ASPS relative to its level in
other translocation sarcomas. We therefore examined MET as a
direct target of transactivation by ASPL-TFE3. We provide multiple lines of evidence to support this hypothesis. Exogenous ASPLTFE3 fusion protein binds directly to the MET promoter in 293
cells, strongly transactivating it. ASPL-TFE3 is also physically
present at the MET promoter in ASPL-TFE3–transfected 293 cells.
Likewise, ChIP analysis in two renal carcinoma cell lines with other
TFE3 translocations provided evidence for occupancy of the MET
promoter by NONO-TFE3 and PSF-TFE3.
Our finding that the up-regulation of MET protein by ASPL-TFE3
in 293 cells leads to MET autophosphorylation raised the possibility
that MET may be constitutively activated in human tumors with
endogenous TFE3 fusions. Indeed, in most ASPS tumors and in
ASPL-TFE3–positive or PRCC-TFE3–positive renal carcinomas, we
found that MET was phosphorylated at tyrosine 1,234 and 1,235 in
the catalytic domain and that HGF was coexpressed. Consistent
with these findings in primary tumor material, we observed
that FU-UR1 cells (with endogenous ASPL-TFE3) showed strong
activation of signaling pathways downstream of MET upon HGF

Aberrant activation of HGF/MET signaling has been implicated
in key oncogenic phenotypes such as uncontrolled cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis (reviewed in ref. 31). Clinically, MET
overexpression or activation correlates with poor prognosis in a
variety of human cancers (30), including usual (nontranslocation)
renal carcinomas (33). Both HGF and MET have been reported to
be constitutively overexpressed in many tumors, resulting in
autocrine or paracrine activation (30). MET can also be activated in
a ligand-independent manner through MET overexpression or
mutation. Missense point mutations in the kinase domain of MET
that lead to its constitutive activation are well described in
sporadic and hereditary papillary renal carcinomas (34). Here, we
have shown that MET activation may play a major role in the
biology of human tumors containing TFE3 fusions, because of its
aberrant transactivation by these fusion oncogenes, as summarized
in Fig. 6.
The transcriptional targets of the fusion oncoproteins that
function as aberrant transcription factors are likely to be central to
the biology of translocation-associated human cancers. A screen

different cell lines, including FU-UR1 renal carcinoma cells (ASPL-TFE3–positive), RH30 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells (PAX3-FKHR–positive), A673 Ewing
sarcoma cells (EWS-FLI1–positive), or the synovial sarcoma cell lines HS-SY-II (SYT-SSX1–positive) and Fuji (SYT-SSX2–positive). B, effects of MET-selective

and the numbers were normalized to that without inhibitor (indicated as 0 Amol/L) and described as a proportion. C, effects of MET depletion on growth of cells with
other TFE3 fusion proteins. First, to confirm the effectiveness of the MET shRNA, COS7 cells were transfected with Flag epitope–tagged MET and LacZ together
with 1 (+) or 2 (++) Ag/well of pSuper expressing control or MET-directed shRNA. Whole-cell extracts were immunoblotted with anti-Flag (MET ) or anti-LacZ (control ).
D, UOK109 renal carcinoma cells (NONO-TFE3 fusion positive) were transfected with pSuper directing the expression of luciferase-directed (control ) or MET-directed
shRNA together with constant amounts of pBABE-Puro. Colonies developing after puromycin selection were counted. Likewise, UOK145 renal carcinoma cells
(PSF-TFE3 fusion positive), infected with retrovirus encoding luciferase-directed (control ) or MET-directed shRNA were selected, fixed, and stained with crystal violet.
Stain was eluted and quantitated (OD595-background ). For comparison, upon the same treatment, HeLa cells were unaffected (not shown). Bars, SD.

dependent prometastatic properties, including cell adhesion to
extracellular matrix, scattering, cell motility, and Matrigel invasion,
suggesting that targeting MET could affect metastatic potential, a
common clinical problem in ASPS. We also examined MET
inhibition by PHA665752. We found that 1 Amol/L PHA665752
strongly blocked HGF-dependent MET phosphorylation both in the
catalytic domain and multifunctional docking site in FU-UR1 cells.
The block in MET phosphorylation upon PHA665752 treatment
suggests that this compound should also inhibit MET downstream
signaling pathways and associated phenotypes. Indeed, we found
that 1 Amol/L PHA665752 caused complete suppression of
downstream signaling and also exhibited inhibitory effects on cell
viability, proliferation, and Matrigel invasion in FU-UR1 cells. In
contrast, we did not observe an equivalent effect of PHA665752 on
the viability of RH30 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells, in spite of
their high expression of MET protein, indicating that the inhibitory
effects of this compound may depend on the genetic context and
cell type, which may represent an important consideration in METtargeted therapies. Thus, based on our data, MET seems to
represent a better therapeutic target in ASPS (and other tumors
with TFE3 fusions) than in alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, where
MET is also up-regulated by the fusion oncoprotein (28) and has
been studied as a therapeutic target (42). Overall, our data support
MET as a potential therapeutic target in tumors with TFE3 fusions
and provide a rationale for clinical trials of MET-targeted therapy
in this tumor group.
We should note some striking parallels between the oncogenic
mechanisms associated with TFE3 deregulation in the context of the
ASPL-TFE3 fusion protein (and highly related fusions such as PRCCTFE3) and MITF deregulation in cutaneous melanoma by overexpression and/or amplification. MITF is phosphorylated at serine
residues in its basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ)
domain and this seems to enhance its ability to activate
transcription (43, 44). As the bHLH-LZ domain is highly conserved
between MITF and TFE3, we explored the phosphorylation state of
ASPL-TFE3. Indeed, we found that the exogenous ASPL-TFE3 is
serine phosphorylated in 293T cells and FU-UR1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, ASPL-TFE3–evoked constitutive activation of
MET signaling pathways could lead to phosphorylation of

stimulation. However, we did not detect any mutations in the
juxtamembrane and catalytic domains of MET in eight ASPS
tumors and three ASPL-TFE3–positive renal carcinomas (data not
shown).
We found that the prominent activation of MET triggered by
ASPL-TFE3 expression also evoked the recruitment of phosphorylated Gab1, leading to the strong activation of downstream PI3K/
Akt and Crk/Sos/Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
signaling pathways (Fig. 6). PI3K/Akt signaling is a crucial pathway
downstream of MET. Furthermore, PI3K bound to phosphorylated
Gab1 has been reported to regulate Rac1 activity through several
guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for Rac1 that are required for
HGF-dependent cell motility (35). Stat3 is required for HGF/MET–
mediated growth in soft agar and tumorigenesis (36), and a recent
study has shown that the aberrant activation of Stat3 also
contributes to MET-mediated cell motility in some cancers (37).
In addition, the activation of ERKs through the Sos-Ras cascade is
linked with uncontrolled proliferation, and sustained activation of
this pathway is required but not sufficient for HGF-dependent
motility and morphogenesis (38–40). Thus, the ASPL-TFE3 fusion
oncoprotein, by transcriptionally up-regulating MET, may evoke
various oncogenic phenotypes through the activation of the ERK
and PI3K/Akt pathways.
Targeting MET in preclinical settings has been attempted using
HGF-neutralizing antibodies, MET antisense oligonucleotides,
dominant-negative forms of MET protein, ribozymes targeting
MET mRNA, and RNA interference (29, 41). More recently, the
small-molecule inhibitor PHA665752 that is selective for MET has
become available (17, 29). The IC50 of PHA665752 against other
tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases has been shown to be at least
300-fold higher than against MET, supporting it as a selective
inhibitor of MET-dependent signaling pathways. In mouse tumor
models, PHA665752 inhibits MET phosphorylation and downstream signal transduction and these effects correlate with tumor
growth inhibition or tumor regression (18).
We achieved almost complete depletion of MET protein by RNA
interference in FU-UR1 cells and this significantly reduced the
effect of HGF on the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways (Fig. 6).
Furthermore, the knockdown of MET completely inhibited HGF-

More generally, specific chromosomal translocations encoding
chimeric transcription factors are considered to play crucial
oncogenic roles in a variety of human cancers but the fusion
proteins themselves seldom represent suitable therapeutic targets.
The present work shows how genes highly differentially expressed
between chimeric transcription factor–associated cancers may
include direct transcriptional targets of these chimeric transcription factors. Restricting such comparisons to kinase genes can help
to narrow the search for direct transcriptional targets of potential
therapeutic significance. The identification of kinase signaling
pathways transcriptionally up-regulated by oncogenic fusion
proteins may reveal more accessible therapeutic targets in this
class of human cancers.

ASPL-TFE3 by one or more pathways, thereby increasing its activity
as a transcriptional activator of MET and other target genes, raising
the possibility of a positive feedback loop. This possibility is under
further investigation. Finally, this model is also supported by a recent
study reporting direct transactivation of MET by MITF in melanocytes through binding of a site in the MET promoter located
within the region examined in our ChIP experiments and
enhancement of MITF activity by HGF/MET signaling (45), suggesting that the MITF amplification seen in some melanomas (46) may
likewise set up a positive feedback loop that could be significant as a
therapeutic target. More recently, Smolen et al. (47) have reported
that gastric cancers with MET gene amplification (associated with
ligand-independent constitutive activation) are very sensitive to
PHA665752. Thus, forced overexpression of MET through either gene
amplification (47) or aberrant transcriptional up-regulation by
amplified MITF (45, 46) or by TFE3 fusion proteins, as described
here, may set up a dependence on MET signaling, making tumor cells
especially susceptible to MET-selective agents. Interestingly, a recent
functional genetic screen led to the observation that TFE3 can
counter the antiproliferative effects of transforming growth factor-h
signaling in human cells (48); if TFE3 fusion proteins share this
function, it could synergize with the proliferative effects of MET
transcriptional up-regulation reported here.
