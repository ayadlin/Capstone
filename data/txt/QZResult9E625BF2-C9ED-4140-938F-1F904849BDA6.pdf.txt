Abstract
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) generally respond well to chemotherapy, but tumors that express low levels
of the transcription factor OCT4 are associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis. Hypoxia is known to
induce drug resistance in TGCTs; however, the mechanistic basis for reduced expression of OCT4 and drug
resistance is unclear. Here we show that hypoxia reduces OCT4 levels and increases the resistance of embryonal
carcinoma (EC) cells to cisplatin and bleomycin. Furthermore, we show that the loss of OCT4 expression under
hypoxia can be triggered by sumoylation, which was regulated by SUMO1 and the SUMO1 peptidase SENP1. Under
hypoxic conditions, overexpression of SUMO1gg (the active form of SUMO1) not only increased the level of
sumoylated OCT4 (Su-OCT4), but also decreased the stability of OCT4 protein. In addition, overexpression of
SENP1 reduced the Su-OCT4 level induced by SUMO1gg overexpression, thereby maintaining OCT4 levels and
enhancing chemosensitivity. Mechanistic investigations revealed that OCT4 sumoylation occurred at K123, as
overexpression of an OCT4-K123R mutant effectively reduced the level of Su-OCT4 under hypoxic conditions.
Taken together, our results showed that hypoxia reduces OCT4 expression levels in ECs to increase drug
resistance and that these effects could be countered to ablate the suppressive effects of hypoxia on
chemosensitivity. Our ﬁndings also highlight SENP1 as a potential therapeutic target for drug resistant
TGCTs. Cancer Res; 72(19); 4963–73. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most common
malignancies among human germ cell tumors and are histologically classiﬁed into seminomas and nonseminomas (1).
Seminomas are generally histologically uniform and resemble
a transformed state of primordial germ cells (PGC). Nonseminomas are typically heterogeneous and include teratocarAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Biochemistry, 2Graduate Institute of

cinomas (with pluripotent embryonal carcinoma, EC), mature
teratomas, yolk sac tumors (YST), and choriocarcinomas (1).
In the clinic, pluripotent seminomas and ECs of TGCTs are
able to differentiate into other tumor types (e.g., teratomas,
YSTs, and choriocarcinomas; 2, 3). Feldman and colleagues
further proposed that differentiated TGCTs are more malignant and display higher resistance to chemotherapy (4). We
therefore presumed the identiﬁcation of a therapeutic target
involved in the differentiation process of pluripotent TGCTs
could improve the prognosis of the drug-resistant germ cell
tumors.
Previous work has shown that drug resistance of TGCTs may
be modulated by retinoic acid treatment (5) and/or hypoxic
stresses (6). Hypoxia is also known to be an important stimulus
for tumor progression and drug susceptibility. As embryos
develop under hypoxic conditions, most notably during the
peri-implantation period, hypoxia is also believed to be
involved in modulating pluripotent cells during early embryogenesis (7). In support of this, the transcription factor OCT4, a
master regulator controlling the pluripotency of embryonic
stem (ES) cells (8), PGCs (9), and induced pluripotent stem
(iPS) cells (10, 11), is upregulated under hypoxic conditions in
ES and a wide variety of cancer cells (12–14). In TGCTs, OCT4 is
upregulated in pluripotent seminomas and ECs (15) and a lack
of OCT4 in ECs has been shown to increase cisplatin resistance
in vitro and in vivo (16, 17). These results highlight the role of
OCT4 in modulating the differentiation status and drug

susceptibility of EC cells. We therefore hypothesized that
hypoxia might increase the drug resistance of TGCT cells by
modulating the level of the pluripotent transcription factor
OCT4.
Sumoylation is a posttranslational modiﬁcation involving
covalent linkage of the small ubiquitin-like modiﬁer (SUMO)
to proteins, which regulates various cellular functions including nuclear-cytosolic transport, transcriptional regulation,
apoptosis, stress responses, cell cycle progression, and protein
stability (18). The sumoylation process is reversible; sumoylation and desumoylation are controlled by ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2I (UBE2I or UBC9) and SUMO1/sentrin speciﬁc
peptidase (SENP) proteins (18). A previous report showed that
the level of mouse Oct4 protein can be regulated by sumoylation: the covalent linkage of SUMO1 at lysine 118 residue (K118)
increased the stability of mouse Oct4 protein under normoxic
conditions (19). However, whether the sumoylation process is
involved in regulating the stability of human OCT4 protein in
pluripotent germ cell tumors remains to be determined.
In the current work, we show that hypoxia reduces human
OCT4 protein in EC cells via sumoylation at K123. Overexpression of SENP1 in hypoxic EC cells effectively increases the level
of OCT4 protein and improves drug susceptibility in vitro and
in vivo. These results indicate an important role for the SENP1mediated desumoylation process in modulating the level of
OCT4 protein and the drug sensitivity of EC cells under hypoxic
conditions.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and hypoxic treatment
NCCIT (CRL-2073), NT2 (CRL-1973), and HEK293T cells
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection.
NCCIT cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen), and NT2 and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (Invitrogen). All cells were
supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 C in a 5% CO2 humidiﬁed
atmosphere. For hypoxic treatment, the cells were cultured at
37 C in 5% CO2/1% O2/94% N2.
In vitro sumoylation assay
The cell-free in vitro sumoylation assay was carried out using
an in vitro sumoylation kit (UW8955, Enzo Life Sciences). HAtagged OCT4 expressed in HEK293T cells was harvested by
immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA-agarose antibody
(A2095, Sigma-Aldrich). In brief, the harvested HA-tagged
OCT4 protein was divided equally into 2 or 3 portions for
sumoylation reactions [SUMO activating enzyme (E1), SUMO
conjugating enzyme (E2, as UBC9), Mg-ATP] in the presence or
absence of His6-SUMO1 protein (UW9195, Enzo Life Sciences)
and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SENP1 (UW9760, Enzo
Life Sciences). Then the reactions were incubated at 37 C for
60 minutes, washed extensively with PBS, and then stopped by
adding sample buffer for SDS-PAGE separation and Western
blot analysis.
Protein stability assays
HEK293T cells were transfected with either HA-OCT4-WT
or HA-OCT4-K123R plasmids using a TurboFect transfection

4964

Cancer Res; 72(19) October 1, 2012

reagent (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. To examine the OCT4 protein stability, plasmid-transfected HEK293T cells were cultivated at 37 C for
24 hours. Then the total cells were pooled together, split
equally into 6-cm plates to ensure the same cell transfection
efﬁciency in each plate. After culture for an additional 24
hours, cycloheximide (CHX; 100 mg/mL, C4859, SigmaAldrich) was added to each plate, and cells were subsequently harvested at the different indicated times for
SDS-PAGE separation and Western blot analysis.
Xenograft tumor models
For renal capsule grafting, 8-week-old nonobese diabetic/
severe combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD-SCID) mice were
obtained from BioLasco Taiwan. NCCIT cells (106 cells)
infected with a lentivirus of an empty vector or HA-SENP1
were engrafted beneath the renal capsule of NOD-SCID mice
according to Szot and colleagues (20). At 8 weeks after implantation, host mice were sacriﬁced by CO2 asphyxiation, and
sutures were dissected for histologic processing. For an in vivo
drug susceptibility analysis, Empty- and HA-SENP1-NCCIT
cells (106 cells with Matrigel) were implanted into thymic nude
mice (BioLasco Taiwan) by a subcutaneous injection. The
tumor volume (1/2  length  width2) was measured every
3 or 4 days. On day 50, nude mice were injected intraperitoneally with cisplatin (3 mg/kg/day) for 7 continuous days.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated at least 3 times with different
individual samples. Data are expressed as the mean  SD.
Statistical differences between sets of data were determined
using paired 2-tailed Student t test, with P < 0.05 considered
signiﬁcant.

Results
Hypoxia induces drug resistance and reduces OCT4
protein in EC cells
Because hypoxia can promote the malignancy and drug
resistance of EC cells (6), we initially examined whether
hypoxia reduces the drug susceptibility of EC cells by
altering the level of OCT4. Cisplatin and bleomycin, 2 of
the most commonly used drugs for TGCT clinical chemotherapy, were used to treat NCCIT and NT2 cells under
normoxia (21% O2) and hypoxia (1% O2). As shown in Fig. 1,
hypoxia induced signiﬁcant drug resistance to cisplatin and
bleomycin in both NCCIT and NT2 cells (Fig. 1A). Moreover,
hypoxia was found to decrease the level of OCT4 protein in a
time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Quantitative analysis
showed that hypoxia decreased the level of OCT4 protein
by 60% in NCCIT cells and by 77% in NT2 cells after a 24hour incubation (H24 of Fig. 1B,  , P < 0.01). However,
hypoxia did not affect the mRNA level of OCT4 in EC cells
(Fig. 1C). The ﬁnding that hypoxia decreased OCT4 protein
level in NCCIT cells was conﬁrmed using immunocytochemical staining combined with confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S1). These observations suggest that hypoxia
may regulate the stability of OCT4 protein via a posttranslational modiﬁcation.

Hypoxia regulates the stability of the OCT4 protein in EC
cells through sumoylation
Because sumoylation can modulate the stability of Oct4
protein in mouse pluripotent cells (19), we examined whether
overexpression of EGFP-SUMO1gg (an active form of SUMO1)
could lead to sumoylation and destabilization of the OCT4
protein in EC cells.
Overexpression of EGFP-SUMO1gg resulted in a dosedependent decrease in the level of the OCT4 protein in NCCIT
cells (Figs. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2). In the presence of
CHX, hypoxia further decreased the level of the OCT4 protein
in EGFP-SUMO1gg-NCCIT cells, compared with CHX treatment under normoxic conditions (Fig. 2B). These results
suggest that hypoxia-mediated sumoylation affects the stability of the OCT4 protein in NCCIT cells.
The ﬁnding that sumoylation of the OCT4 protein under
hypoxia affects its stability was further supported by immunoﬂuorescent staining experiments. As shown in Fig. 2C,
immunoﬂuorescent staining of NCCIT cells in the presence

of 10 mmol/L MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, showed stronger
colocalization of OCT4 protein (red) and EGFP-SUMO1 (green)
in nuclei of NCCIT cells expressing SUMO1gg under hypoxic
conditions compared with either SUMO1aa overexpression or
normoxic conditions (colocalization is indicated by yellow,
þMG132 vs. MG132 panel). Western blotting also showed
that hypoxia enhanced the generation of high-molecularweight sumoylated-OCT4 (Su-OCT4) in NCCIT cells expressing
EGFP-SUMO1gg (Fig. 2D, lanes 5 and 6 vs. lane 4, indicated by
an arrowhead), but not in NCCIT cells expressing EGFPSUMO1aa (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–3). The unsumoylated OCT4 is
shown for both short- and long-exposure times (Fig. 2D,
indicated by arrows). These results further support OCT4
sumoylation under hypoxia reducing the stability of the OCT4
protein in NCCIT cells.
Sumoylation of OCT4 protein occurs at K123
A previous study showed that sumoylation at K118 regulates
the stability of the Oct4 protein in mice (19). However, the

sumoylation site of the human OCT4 protein is unknown.
Using the sumoylation motif of mouse Oct4 (yKxD/E) as a
reference, K123 and K222 were identiﬁed as potential sumoylation sites in the human OCT4 (Fig. 3A). To examine sumoylation at these sites in the human OCT4 protein, an HA-tagged
wild-type OCT4 expression plasmid (HA-OCT4-WT) and 3
HA-tagged mutant OCT4 expression plasmids were constructed. The K123 amino acid residue was mutated to R
in the peptide produced from the HA-OCT4-K123R mutant
expression plasmid, and the HA-OCT4-K222R construct
produced a peptide that contained the same substitution
at Position 222. The double-mutant expression plasmid, HAOCT4-2KR, produced a peptide with both K to R substitutions. The wild type and mutant expression plasmids were
transfected into HEK293T cells, and the HA-OCT4 proteins
were pulled down by anti-HA agarose beads for cell-free
in vitro sumoylation assays. As shown in Fig. 3B, the in vitro
sumoylation assay showed a unique sumoylation site at

4966

Position 123 of the HA-OCT4 protein. The high-molecularweight sumoylated forms of the HA-OCT4-WT and HAOCT4-K222R proteins are shown in lanes 2 and 7, respectively, and GST-SENP1 effectively reduced the levels of the
Su-OCT4 protein (lane 3 vs. lane 2).
To examine the direct interaction of endogenous OCT4 and
SUMO1 in EC cells, pull-down assays with antibodies against
endogenous OCT4 were conducted to isolate the OCT4 protein
from NCCIT and NT2 cells. Western blotting with anti-OCT4,
anti-SUMO1, and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibodies
showed a high-molecular-weight Su-OCT4 (Fig. 3C).
To further conﬁrm this result, plasmids of HA-OCT4-WT,
-K123R, -K222R, or -2KR were cotransfected with FLAGSUMO1gg and UBC9 into HEK293T cells for in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 3D, the Su-OCT4 was
detected in WT- and K222R-HEK293T cells (lanes 2 and 7), and
coexpression of SENP1 signiﬁcantly reduced the level of SuOCT4 (lane 3 vs. lane 2). Sumoylation of OCT4 was further

signiﬁcantly increased the sumoylation of the wild-type OCT4
protein in HEK293T cells (lane 4 vs. lane 3), and the level of
sumoylated HA-OCT4-WT was signiﬁcantly reduced by coexpression of HA-SENP1 (lane 5 vs. lane 4). High-molecularweight Su-OCT4 was not detected in cells cotransfected with
the HA-OCT4-K123R (lane 7 vs. lane 4) and HA-OCT4-2KR
mutant constructs (lane 11 vs. lane 4), respectively. These
results show that sumoylation of the human OCT4 protein
occurs at K123.

Because hypoxia signiﬁcantly decreased the level of OCT4
protein in EC cells (Fig. 1), we examined whether hypoxia
regulates OCT4 protein stability through sumoylation. For this
purpose, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with HA-OCT4
(WT, K123R, K222R, or 2KR) and the EGFP-SUMO1gg plasmids
and were incubated under normoxia or hypoxia with addition
of MG132. As shown in Fig. 3F, under normoxic conditions, the
Su-OCT4 protein was detected in HA-OCT4-WT- and HAOCT4-K222R-HEK293T cells (lanes 1 and 7, indicated by an
arrowhead). Cotransfection with HA-OCT4-K123R or HAOCT4-2KR expression plasmids completely blocked Su-OCT4
formation under normoxia (lanes 5 and 9). These results

conﬁrm that the sumoylation of human OCT4 protein occurs
at K123. We also found that hypoxia signiﬁcantly increased the
Su-OCT4 level in cells that were cotransfected with HA-OCT4WT (lane 2 vs. lane 1) or HA-OCT4-222R (lane 8 vs. lane 7). The
unsumoylated OCT4 protein level is shown in both long and
short exposures (indicated by arrows). Quantitative analysis
showed that the ratio of Su-OCT4/OCT4 in HA-OCT4-WT- and
HA-OCT4-K222R-HEK293T cells was signiﬁcantly increased
under hypoxia (Fig. 3F, right panel).
To further examine whether hypoxia decreased the stability
of OCT4, HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-OCT4-WT
and HA-OCT4-K123R expression plasmids before treatment
with CHX, and cells were harvested at various time points. As
shown in Fig. 3G, hypoxia decreased the half-life of OCT4 in the
presence of CHX, compared with similar normoxic conditions
(WT panel), and the wild-type OCT4 protein displayed a longer
half-life than did the mutant HA-OCT4-K123R protein under
hypoxic conditions. These results collectively show that hypoxia enhances sumoylation of the human OCT4 protein at
K123, which leads to a reduction in the stability of the human
OCT4 protein.
SENP1 suppresses OCT4 sumoylation and increases
OCT4 stability under hypoxic conditions
SENP1 is a negative regulator of protein sumoylation. Initially, we found that the level of SENP1 transcription was lower
in NCCIT/NT2 cells compared with human ES cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). We further found that overexpression of
SENP1 in NCCIT cells suppressed hypoxia-induced reduction
of the OCT4 protein. NCCIT cells were infected with a lentivirus
carrying an empty vector (vector control) or HA-SENP1-IREStRFP (HA-SENP1). As shown in Fig. 4A, immunoﬂuorescent
staining showed that higher expression of SENP1 (indicated by
tRFP, red ﬂuorescence) correlated with the more intense OCT4
staining (indicated by ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate, green ﬂuorescence). Western blotting further conﬁrmed that SENP1 can
suppress hypoxia-induced reduction of the OCT4 protein in
NCCIT cells. Quantitative analysis showed that overexpression
of HA-SENP1 signiﬁcantly increased the OCT4 protein level in
hypoxic conditions (Fig. 4B;  , P < 0.05, n ¼ 3). The increased
stability of the endogenous OCT4 protein resulting from
coexpression of SENP1 was further conﬁrmed by CHX treatment. The HA-SENP-NCCIT cells contained a higher level of
the OCT4 protein after the 12 hours incubation under normoxic conditions, compared with the vector control group
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
In contrast, knockdown of UBC9, a SUMO-conjugating
enzyme, in cells by shRNAs blocked hypoxia-induced reduction
of the OCT4 protein (Fig. 4C, H24, shLuc vs. shUBC9). These
results support the assertion that sumoylation of the OCT4
protein under hypoxia affects its stability in NCCIT cells.
Regulation of the OCT4 protein stability by SENP1 was
further examined using tumor-bearing mice models. Control
NCCIT cells (infected with an empty lentiviral vector) and
SENP1-overexpressing NCCIT cells (infected with lenti-HASENP1) were transplanted into renal capsules of NOD-SCID
mice. As shown in Fig. 4D, tRFP staining marked grafted tumor
tissues (Fig. 4D, tRFP panel). Compared with the empty vector

4968

Cancer Res; 72(19) October 1, 2012

group, NCCIT cells that expressed HA-SENP1 had more intense
OCT4 staining (Fig. 4D; HA-SENP1 panel vs. Empty vector
panel). Lower cytokeratin expression was correlated with
intense OCT4 staining and was observed in NCCIT cells that
expressed HA-SENP1 compared with empty vector control
cells. Quantitative analysis conﬁrmed that there were more
OCT4-positive cells in the tumor generated from transplantation of SENP1-overexpressed NCCIT cells than in the tumor
generated from transplantation of control NCCIT cells. The
ﬁnding that OCT4 staining was negatively correlated with
cytokeratin staining shows that SENP1 suppresses the differentiation of NCCIT cells in vivo via maintaining the level of the
OCT4 protein (Fig. 4E).
SENP1 increases the drug sensitivity of EC cells in
hypoxic conditions
Low levels of OCT4 are known to be associated with higher
drug resistance in ECs (16, 17). Because SENP1 can increase
OCT4 protein stability in hypoxic conditions (Fig. 4), we
examined the effect of SENP1 on the drug sensitivity of EC
cells. As shown in Fig. 5, higher drug sensitivity was observed in
SENP1-overexpressing NCCIT cells compared with control
NCCIT cells (Fig. 5A;  , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01). The IC50 value
of HA-SENP1-overexpressing NCCIT cells in hypoxic conditions (21.63  0.12 mmol/L for cisplatin and 7.33  1.04 mmol/L
for bleomycin) was greatly decreased to a level similar to that of
control or HA-SENP1-overexpressing NCCIT cells in normoxic
conditions (16.9  0.83 mmol/L for cisplatin and 3.72  0.52
mmol/L for bleomycin; Supplementary Table S3). There was no
signiﬁcant difference in cell viability between control and HASENP1-overexpressing NCCIT cells in either normoxic or
hypoxic conditions (Supplementary Fig. S5). Xenograft experiments using nude mice (n ¼ 35) were conducted to examine
the effect of SENP1 on the drug susceptibility of EC cells in vivo.
In these experiments, Control NCCIT cells (infected with
empty lentiviral vector) and SENP1-overexpressing NCCIT
cells (infected with lenti-HA-SENP1) were injected into nude
mice, and the tumor volume was determined 50 days postinjection (Fig. 5B). The tumor-bearing mice were then treated
with cisplatin for 7 continuous days (3 mg/kg/day, via
intraperitoneal injection) and tumor size was measured on
days 1, 4, and 7. When compared with the day 1 control
group, cisplatin signiﬁcantly decreased the size of the tumor
in the HA-SENP1 group (35% vs. 73% decrease; Fig. 5C).
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed that the
tumors in the HA-SENP1 group were poorly differentiated
compared with the control group tumors (Fig. 5D). The
positive hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) expression
indicates the hypoxic microenvironment in tumor regions
(Fig. 5D). Importantly, fewer tRFP-labeled and p21-expressing cells were observed in the HA-SENP1 groups, suggesting
that SENP1-overexpressing NCCIT cells were sensitive to
cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5D). Positive staining of cleaved
caspase-3 in the HA-SENP1 groups (Fig. 5D) further supported the higher cisplatin susceptibility of SENP1-overexpressing NCCIT cells. Quantitative analysis conﬁrmed the
observation and showed that SENP1 increased the susceptibility of NCCIT cells to cisplatin treatment in vivo (Fig. 5E).

SENP1 enhances the drug sensitivity of EC cells by
maintaining the level of the OCT4 protein
To examine whether the SENP1 protein increases the
drug sensitivity of EC cells by maintaining the OCT4 protein
stability, we knocked down the expression of the endogenous OCT4 protein in NCCIT cells in which HA-SENP1 was
simultaneously overexpressed in the presence of cisplatin or
bleomycin. Knockdown of OCT4 and the overexpression of
HA-SENP1 in NCCIT cells are shown in Fig. 6A. Under both
normoxic and hypoxic conditions, OCT4 silencing signiﬁcantly increased IC50 to cisplatin and bleomycin in both
the HA-SENP1-NCCIT cells (Fig. 6B, lanes 7–12) and the

NCCIT control cells (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–6), clearly demonstrating an inverse relationship between the level of endogenous OCT4 protein and the IC50 value (Fig. 6B). These
results show that SENP1 regulates susceptibility to cisplatin
and bleomycin through its effects on the level of OCT4
protein in EC cells.

Discussion
OCT4 is a key transcription factor involved in regulating the
self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells and PGCs (8, 9).
Recent work has also shown that OCT4 has a key role in

reprogramming somatic cells to a pluripotent stage (11). Most
TGCTs express OCT4, suggesting that it plays a critical role in
germ cell neoplasia and that it may be useful as a marker for
preinvasive and invasive TGCTs (21, 22). A portion of TGCTs
display resistance to chemotherapy, and this chemoresistance
is associated with several genetic elements (23) including the
loss of OCT4 expression. Recent evidence has showed that loss
of OCT4 in EC cells increases resistance to cisplatin treatment
(16, 17). However, the mechanism underlying the loss of OCT4
in EC cells is less clear. OCT4 is known to be regulated by
multiple processes, including epigenetic methylation (24),

posttranslational sumoylation (19), and hypoxic oxygen tension (25). Hypoxia is known to affect the level of OCT4
expression in ES cells (12), PGCs (25), iPS cells (26), and a
wide variety of cancer stem cells (CSC; 13, 14). For example,
hypoxia can increase the level of OCT4 expression in ES cells
through stabilizing the hypoxia-inducible protein HIF-2a. It
has been shown that HIF-2a binds to the hypoxia response
element of the OCT4 promoter, and then activates OCT4
expression (25). We also found that hypoxia increased the
HIF-2a level in ES cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A), but not in EC
cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B). This result may explain why

SENP1 Increases OCT4 Stability and Drug Susceptibility of EC

cells by maintaining the level of the OCT4 protein. A, OCT4 silencing and
SENP1 overexpression in NCCIT cells was observed. B, half maximal

hypoxia increased the OCT4 expression in ES cells, but
decreased the OCT4 protein level in EC cells (Supplementary
Fig. S6). The discrepancy of hypoxia effect on the levels of HIF2a and OCT4 in ES and EC cells may be because of the different
expression levels of SENP1 in these cells. SENP1 has been
showed to be a regulator of HIF-2a protein stability (27).
Compared with ES cells, the SENP1 level in EC cells is extremely
low (around 20% of the ES cells; Supplementary Fig. S3). This
low expression of SENP1 may explain the low HIF-2a and OCT4
protein levels in EC cells under hypoxia (Supplementary Figs.
S3 and S6).
SENP1 can cause desumoylation by removing the SUMO
group from target proteins. The current work showed that
SENP1 can reduce the sumoylation of OCT4 protein induced by
hypoxia in EC cells, leading to increased OCT4 protein stability
and enhancement of drug sensitivity. Hypoxia is known to
increase protein sumoylation-associated gene expression,
including SUMO1 and RSUME (a small RWD-containing protein that is a sumoylation enhancer; 28, 29). In a SENP1/
mice model, hypoxia induces sumoylation of HIF-1a and drives

www.aacrjournals.org

its ubiquitination and protein degradation (30). Removing a
SUMO1 group from the nuclear HIF-1a by SENP1 activates
HIF-1a and HIF-1b complex formation, thus driving the transcriptional activation of EPO, VEGF, and Glut-1 (30). Moreover,
a sumoylation modiﬁcation at the speciﬁc K118 residue
increases mouse Oct4 protein stability under normoxic conditions (19). In our results, hypoxia downregulated SENP1
protein level (Supplementary Fig. S7A) and upregulated the
RSUME mRNA level (a sumoylation enhancer; Supplementary
Fig. S7B), and decreased human OCT4 stability in EC cells
through sumoylation modiﬁcation at K123 (Figs. 2 and 3).
Overexpression of SENP1 in EC cells removed SUMO1 from
OCT4 (Fig. 3B, D–F), and increased OCT4 protein stability and
drug susceptibility (Figs. 4 and 5).
Loss of OCT4 in EC cells has been shown to increase
resistance to cisplatin treatment (23), but the mechanism
behind this remains to be determined. In several types of CSCs,
hypoxia is known to increase the OCT4 protein level, thereby
enhancing drug resistance (31, 32). For example, signaling of
AKT and ABCG2 is known to mediate OCT4-induced drug
resistance in hepatocellular carcinomas (33). However, OCT4
seems to play an opposite role in EC cells. Reduction of OCT4
via hypoxia or retinoic acid treatment in EC cells has been
shown to be associated with increase in drug resistance (5, 6).
The mechanisms that lead to increase in drug resistance in
differentiated EC cells have been proposed to involve epigenetic remodeling and p21 regulation (34, 35). In addition to
the role of epigenetic remodeling, our current work shows
that overexpression of SENP1 in EC cells under hypoxia
signiﬁcantly restores the level of OCT4 protein and increases
drug susceptibility both in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 4 and 5).
The role of SENP1 in enhancing the drug susceptibility of EC
cells is supported by the lower expression of cytoplasmic p21
and the higher level of cleaved caspase-3 found in the HASENP1-xenograft tumors (Fig. 5D and E). These results are
consistent with previous work showing that OCT4 negatively

regulates p21, which is highly expressed in chemoresistant
germ cell tumors and protected against cisplatin-induced
apoptosis (35).
In conclusion, the current work shows that hypoxia
decreases the level of OCT4 protein in EC cells via sumoylation
at K123 (Fig. 7). Overexpression of SENP1 in EC cells under
hypoxia can effectively restore the level of OCT4 protein and
improve drug sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. These ﬁndings
suggest that SENP1 may be a promising therapeutic target for
drug-resistant TGCTs.
