ABSTRACT
Cancer cells employ glutaminolysis to provide a source of intermediates for
their upregulated biosynthetic needs. Glutaminase, which catalyzes the conversion
of glutamine to glutamate, is gaining increasing attention as a potential drug target.
Small-molecule inhibitors such as BPTES and CB-839, which target the allosteric site of
glutaminase with high specificity, demonstrate immense promise as anti-tumor drugs.
Here, we report the study of a new BPTES analog, N,N′-(5,5′-(trans-cyclohexane-1,3-diyl)
bis(1,3,4-tiadiazole-5,2-diyl))bis(2-phenylacetamide) (trans-CBTBP), and compared its
inhibitory effect against that of CB-839 and BPTES. We show that CB-839 has a 30- and
50-fold lower IC50 than trans-CBTBP and BPTES, respectively. To explore the structural
basis for the differences in their inhibitory efficacy, we solved the complex structures of
cKGA with 1S, 3S-CBTBP and CB-839. We found that CB-839 produces a greater degree of
interaction with cKGA than 1S, 3S-CBTBP or BPTES. The results of this study will facilitate
the rational design of new KGA inhibitors to better treat glutamine-addicted cancers.

emerging target for cancer therapeutics [7, 9–11]. Indeed,
treating tumor cells with an antisense glutaminase
mRNA induces apoptosis under oxidative stress [12].
To date, several approaches using small molecules have
been used to inhibit glutaminase [8, 13]. Competitive
inhibitors, such as 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON)
and azaserine, have had limited success against tumors
owing to their severe toxicity and non-specificity
[13–15]. Two classes of allosteric inhibitors have been
reported, and these vary in their inhibition mechanism:
(1) compound-968 (5-(3-bromo-4-(dimethylamino)
phenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-2,3,5,6
tetrahydrobenzo[a]
phenanthridin-4(1H)-one) and (2) BPTES (bis-2-(5phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide).
Compound-968 is specific to GLS but shows limited
potency in the presence of the inorganic phosphates that
promote GLS activation by tetramerization [7]. BPTES,
on the other hand, is a GLS1-specific inhibitor that is
active even in the presence of inorganic phosphates
[16], with some anti-tumoral success against breast,
glioblastoma and B lymphoma cancer cell lines [10, 17–
19]. A recent study suggests that the concomitant use of

INTRODUCTION
One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is their
increased reliance on glycolysis for their bioenergetic and
biosynthetic requirements, even in the presence of oxygen
[1, 2]. In addition to maintaining aerobic glycolysis,
cancer cells display a characteristic reprogramming of
metabolic pathways and glutamine-dependent anaplerosis
to maintain the high flux of intermediates required for their
upregulated nucleotide, protein and fatty-acid biosynthesis
[3]. Glutaminase is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes
the first step in glutamine-dependent anaplerosis by
converting glutamine to glutamate, more simply referred
to as glutaminolysis. GLS1 and GLS2 encode two primary
isoforms of human glutaminase. GLS1 has two full-length
splice variants, kidney-type glutaminase (KGA) and
glutaminase-C (GAC), whereas GLS2 encodes liver-type
glutaminase (LGA) [4]. Both GLS1 isoforms share an
identical catalytic domain.
Glutaminase is also reportedly upregulated in
response to oncogenes such as c-Myc, Raf, Ras and the
Rho GTPase [5–8] and, because of this, glutaminase is an

glutaminolysis inhibitors and antagonists against certain
tumor-derived chemokines, such as IL-8 [20], could
improve the antitumor effect.
In the past, we have demonstrated the inhibition
mechanisms for an active site inhibitor, DON, and
an allosteric inhibitor, BPTES [8, 13]. Others and we
have reported that BPTES inhibits KGA by binding
to an allosteric site between a pair of homodimers, and
this results in a dramatic conformational change in key
loop residues (Glu312-Pro329) that render the tetramer
inactive [8, 21]. Although, BPTES has shown promise in
the treatment of a range of cancer types, its low solubility
and moderate potency has limited its pharmacological
applications [22]. In an attempt to circumvent the potency
and solubility limitations of BPTES, various BPTES
analogs have been developed. One promising candidate,
CB-839, first characterized by Gross et al., is currently
undergoing clinical trials. Compared with BPTES, CB839 is reported to have higher solubility and superior
antiproliferative activity in triple-negative breast cancer
cells [19]. Furthermore, CB-839 has a 13-fold lower IC50
value, slower reversibility kinetics, and, most importantly,
a stronger affinity for GLS1 over BPTES [23]. The
compound also demonstrates antitumor efficacy in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma, solid
tumors and hematological malignancies [24–26]. Despite
its current successes, the structural basis for this potent
inhibitory activity of CB-839 has not been determined.
As a part of our continued efforts to understand
the allosteric inhibitory mechanism of KGA and
develop superior inhibitors, here we characterized the
inhibitory efficacy and toxicity of a new BPTES analog
developed by Agios (Cambridge, MA), N,N′-(5,5′-(transcyclohexane-1,3-diyl)bis(1,3,4-tiadiazole-5,2-diyl))bis(2phenylacetamide), hereafter referred to as trans-CBTBP
[27], and compared it against CB-839 and BPTES.
Additionally, we determined the crystal structures of
the cKGA (catalytic domain Ile221-Leu533 of KGA)
in complex with the trans-CBTBP enantiomer (1S,
3S-CBTBP), and CB-839. These studies have enhanced
our understanding of how specific modifications can affect
the inhibitory potency of the compound and will aid in the
design of new lead molecules for therapeutics.

explore the role of these interactions in terms of their
effect on inhibitor affinity, we chose two representative
BPTES analogs, trans-CBTBP and CB-839 to determine
the mode of cKGA inhibition. Trans-CBTBP is
structurally similar to BPTES, with the exception of a
1,3-di-substituted cyclohexyl ring in place of the acyclic
aliphatic linker on BPTES. CB-839, unlike BPTES and
trans-CBTBP, is asymmetric across its center and has
multiple unique moieties, including the replacement of the
terminal phenylacetyl groups with a pyridylacetyl group
and a trifluoromethoxylphenyl acetyl group, as well as
the substitution of a pyridazine ring for one of the two
thiadiazole rings (Figure 1A).

Inhibition of cKGA by trans-CBTBP and
CB-839
In order to compare the inhibitory efficacies of the
three inhibitors: BPTES, trans-CBTBP and CB-839, we
performed both in-vitro and in-vivo inhibition assay with
recombinant cKGA (Figure 1B; Supplementary Figure S3).
Among the three inhibitors, CB-839 showed the lowest IC50
values. Although the in-vitro assay shows that both BPTES
and trans-CBTBP demonstrate similar IC50 values; in
comparison with BPTES, trans-CBTBP displays a smaller
number of rotatable bonds (NRB). The reduction in NRBs
(8 in trans-CBTBP vs. 12 in BPTES) in trans-CBTBP
would improve the probability of good absorption [28].
Figure 1B shows the dose-response curves for
these two inhibitors in 293T epithelial cells. The IC50
values for glutaminase inhibition for trans-CBTBP and
CB-839 were determined to be 0.1 μM and 3.2 × 10-3
μM, respectively, with a 30-fold difference in activity
between the two compounds. Further, we note that the
IC50 for trans-CBTBP is only a moderate improvement
over that for BPTES (IC50= 0.16 μM) [8] and could be
due to greater cell permeability of trans-CPTBP over
BPTES. To confirm that glutaminase activities measured
were attributed from ectopic cKGA, glutaminase activity
were assessed in the absence of ectopic KGA. The
endogenous glutaminase activity was 3% of the ectopic
expressed cKGA (Supplementary Figure S4). In addition,
the endogenous glutaminase was completely inhibited at
very low concentrations (1nM) of inhibitors.
Next, to verify the toxicity of the inhibitors to nontumorigenic cells, we conducted a cell viability assay
(Figure 1C). We found that neither CB-839 nor transCBTBP caused substantial cytotoxicity at concentrations
up to 0.1 μM, suggesting that both inhibitors are safe at
their effective concentration range.
Overall, we find CB-839 to be a more potent
inhibitor than trans-CBTBP and BPTES, with transCBTBP showing only a small improvement in its in vivo
inhibitory activity over BPTES. To further understand
these differences in potency, we solved the complex
crystal structures of both inhibitors with cKGA.

RESULTS
Exploring the allosteric interactions involved in
the inhibition of KGA
Our previous structural studies on the allosteric
inhibition of cKGA with BPTES reported two primary
interactions between cKGA and BPTES: (1) Hydrogen
bonding contacts between cKGA and the thiadiazole
moiety and the amide nitrogen of BPTES; (2)
Hydrophobic interactions between the cKGA allosteric
pocket and aliphatic BPTES linker [8]. In an attempt to

cKGA: 1S,3S-CBTBP Complex

1S, 3S-CBTBP forms multiple hydrophobic interactions
with the side chains of Tyr394, Phe322 and Leu321
from both the neighboring cKGA monomers (see
Supplementary Table S2).

A racemic mixture of trans-CBTBP enantiomers:
1S, 3S and 1R, 3R were used for co-crystallization
with cKGA. The cKGA: 1S, 3S-CBTBP was found to
crystallize and the structure was determined at 2.74 Å
resolution (Table 1; Figure 2A, 2B). However multiple
crystallization conditions did not yield the crystals
of cKGA: 1R, 3R-CBTBP complex. This indicated a
higher preference of the 1S, 3S stereoisomer for cKGA
over the 1R, 3R form. The 1S, 3S-CBTBP molecule was
positioned using a Fo-Fc Simulated Annealing omit map
(Supplementary Figure S1A).
Trans-CBTBP shares an internal symmetry across its
1,3-di-substituted cyclohexyl linker (Figure 1A). BPTES
and 1S, 3S-CBTBP share similar symmetric halves,
and have identical hydrogen bonding interactions with
cKGA (Figure 3A, Supplementary Table S1). However
the differences in the hydrophobic interactions of these
two inhibitors with cKGA is prominent. Unlike the
aliphatic linker of BPTES, the cyclohexane linker from

cKGA: CB-839 Complex
The complex structure for cKGA:CB-839 was
determined at 2.1 Å (Table 1; Figure 2C, 2D). Two
molecules of CB-839 are found to be interacting with the
cKGA tetramer. Similar to BPTES and 1S, 3S-CBTBP,
several hydrogen-bonding interactions mediate the binding
of CB-839 with cKGA (Supplementary Table S1). Similar
to that observed for the cKGA:1S, 3S-CBTBP complex,
the cKGA backbone amide groups of Phe322 and Leu323
are involved in hydrogen bonding contact with CB-839.
Notable unique interactions include the hydrogen bonds
between the pyridazinyl and acetyl groups of the inhibitor
with the side-chains of Try394, Lys320 and Asn324 from
cKGA. Furthermore, the thiadiazol group of CB-839 is
also involved in a water-mediated interaction with Asp327

of cKGA. The terminal moieties of the inhibitor–fluorine
and oxygen atoms of the trifluromethoxy phenyl group,
as well as the nitrogen atoms from the pyridine ring of
the inhibitor are not engaged in any hydrogen bonding
contact with cKGA. It is plausible, however, that the
trifluoromethoxy phenyl group could help improve the
solubility of CB-839 [29, 30].
Hydrophobic interactions between the aliphatic linker
of CB-839 and the side-chains of Phe322 and Tyr394 from
cKGA also contribute to the binding (Supplementary Table
S2). The pyridinyl moiety and terminal phenyl ring also

Comparison of the binding of BPTES, 1S,
3S-CBTBP and CB-839 with cKGA
A comparison of the cKGA complex structures of
BPTES, 1S, 3S-CBTBP, and CB-839 indicates that binding
differences are primarily due to the strengths of interactions
made with the allosteric pocket of cKGA. The cKGA
allosteric pocket resembles a lock, with negligible changes

observed in its conformation in complex with the different
inhibitors; the inhibitors are analogous to different keys
with their moieties acting as levers. The binding affinity is a
function of the flexibility and orientation of the interacting
moieties from the inhibitors (Figure 4).
The interaction of 1S, 3S-CBTBP with the cKGA
allosteric pocket is primarily mediated by hydrogen
bonding interactions from the thiadiazol group and
hydrophobic interactions from the cyclohexane linker. In
comparison, the driving force for CB-839 binding is the
higher number of hydrogen bonds and this is assisted by
the hydrophobic interactions from the pyridinyl ring. The
lower effective concentrations for CB-839 are consistent

with an improved cumulative strength of the interactions.
The calculated buried surface areas of 520 Å2 for CB-839
and 460 Å2 for 1S, 3S-CBTBP further validate the greater
relative strength of the CB-839 interaction [31].

DISCUSSION
Metabolic pathway enzymes are increasingly being
investigated as potential drug targets for cancer treatment
[32–34]. The mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase in
particular is under intense investigation in many tumor
models [35], with an immense amount of time invested in
the development of selective and non-toxic small-molecule

glutaminase inhibitors with superior metabolic stability
and pharmacodynamics. Various recent efforts have
shown that inhibition of glutaminolysis offers synergistic
effects when administered alongside anti-NOTCH1,
β-lapachone, or BCL-2 inhibition for the treatment of T
cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), pancreatic
cancer, or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), respectively
[36–38]. A structural understanding of the differences
in the protein: inhibitor interactions as a result of the
small modifications to these inhibitors will help in the
development and rational design of more potent inhibitors.
In this study, we report the inhibitory efficacies
along with complex structural studies of two analogs of
BPTES, trans-CBTBP and CB-839. As shown in Figure
1B, we observe a 50-fold lower IC50 value for CB-839
as compared with BPTES (30-fold as compared with
trans-CBTBP), when using a cell-culture based assay
to determine the dose response. This is consistent with
the inhibition assay performed by Gross et al. for GAC

with CB-839 [23]. Further, we have explored the utility
of the inhibitors as drugs by correlating their effective
concentration range to their toxicities. Both transCBTBP and CB-839 were found to be safe at their IC50
concentrations. Intriguingly, increasing CB-839 inhibitor
treatment starting from 0.5mM, leads to rapid decrease
of proliferation. In contrast, trans-CBTBP treatment does
not have a major impact on the proliferation of cells,
suggesting lower toxicity of trans-CBTBP over CB839 (Figure 1C). The mechanism of cell death at higher
concentrations of CB-839 is yet to be determined and
warrants further investigation.
Both 1S, 3S-CBTBP and CB-839 were found to
interact with the same allosteric pocket of cKGA, as
reported for BPTES. The effective concentrations of transCBTBP and CB-839 were compared with BPTES and its
other analogs (Table 2). The low affinity of inhibitors 4
and 3 for cKGA could be attributed to the absence of the
terminal phenyl ring and acetyl group, which are involved

in interactions with the cKGA allosteric pocket as observed
in the crystal structure of the cKGA:BPTES complex.
Inhibitor 2 likely has better binding because of the central
sulfur atom, which restrains the flexibility of the diethyl
sulfide linker. The terminal phenyl rings on inhibitor 5
that are substituted with electron-donating methoxy
groups, leads to moderate improvements in its affinity over
inhibitors 2, 3 and 4. Unlike BPTES, the cyclohexane linker
of 1S, 3S-CBTBP improves the hydrophobic interactions
and imposes rigidity across the center of the inhibitor. The
terminal electron-withdrawing trifluoromethoxy group
of CB-839, substituted on the phenyl ring on BPTES,
deactivates the aromatic ring system and increases the
electronegativity of the pyridazinyl nitrogen atoms, thus
strengthening the hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition
the trifluoromethoxy group increases the lipophilicity of
the inhibitor.

The findings from these studies provide further
insights into rational design of the next generation of
KGA inhibitors by utilizing knowledge garnered from
ligand-based interactions. From the activity assay, we
have shown that CB-839 has enhanced inhibitory efficacy
over trans-CBTBP and BPTES. Since the terminal atoms
of the inhibitors do not engage in key interactions with the
cKGA, chemical modifications should be targeted around
this region to improve the solubility of new inhibitors
[39]. Since both GAC and KGA share exactly the same
catalytic domain, the structural and inhibition studies
performed with cKGA would be similar and applicable
to the glutaminase domain of GAC as well. Moreover,
building on what we now know, a chimeric inhibitor
with a cyclohexane linker and a pyridazinyl ring might
improve the interactions of the compound with KGA and
GAC [27].

mM glycerol-2-phosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate,
and 20mM sodium fluoride and protease inhibitors (Roche
Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Lysates were
quantified for protein amount using BCA protein assay
kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Cells were
incubated with 10 μl cKGA-inhibitor at 37°C for 10 min
with 10 μl of assay mix consisting of 20 mM glutamine,
50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 8.6), 100 mM phosphate, and
0.2 mM EDTA. The reaction was quenched with the
addition of 2 μl of 3 M HCl. The reaction mixture was
then incubated for 30 min at room temperature (24°C)
with 200 μl of the second assay mix (2.2 U glutamate
dehydrogenase, 80 mM Tris-acetate (pH 9.4), 200 mM
hydrazine, 0.25 mM ADP, and 2 mM nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide) and the absorbance read at 340 nm using an
Infinite 200 microplate reader (Tecan, Durham, NC).

The cKGA was cloned into pET-28(b) fused to an
N-terminal His tag, and expressed in Escherichia coli
BL21 (DE3)-RIL-Codon plus cells. The cells were induced
with 200 μM IPTG and then sonicated in the lysis buffer
consisting of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, and
one tablet of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche
Diagnostics, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The cell lysate
was bound to Ni-NTA affinity beads (Roche Diagnostics)
and eluted with 400 mM imidazole. The protein was
further purified using a Superdex-200 column (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) in a buffer containing
20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and
3 mM DTT. The protein was then concentrated to 20 mg/
ml concentration using protein concentrators (Vivaspin,
Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany).

Cell proliferation assays

Cell culture, transfection and inhibitors
treatment

293T cells were trypsinized and replated into 96well plates and then treated with inhibitors for 48 h.
293T cells treated with DMSO served as the control.
The amount of cell proliferation was determined using
an MTT proliferation assay kit (Promega, Fitchburg,
WI) as described by the manufacturer. At least three
independent experiments were carried out, each with
multiple replicates. Statistical significance was analyzed
using ANOVA and the Student-Newman-Kuels multiple
range test (StatsDirect, Cheshire, UK). Data are mean ±
SD (p < 0.05) and are expressed as fold increase over the
control cells.

Human embryonic kidney epithelial 293T cells were
maintained in RPMI-1640 (Hyclone, GE Life Sciences)
with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg,
MD), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/
ml streptomycin (HyClone). Cells were grown at 37°C
in 5% CO2. Confluent cells grown in 12-well plates were
transfected using TransIT (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI)
with 1 μg of plasmid encoding wild-type KGA and then
incubated with the indicated inhibitors for 24 h.

In-vitro glutaminase assay

Crystallization and structure determination

The glutaminase assay was performed in two steps
using a dual enzyme assay [41]. Inhibitors were dissolved
in DMSO. 10 μl of DMSO/inhibitor was incubated with
80 μl assay mixture A (1 μM recombinant cKGA , 50 mM
Tris-acetate (pH 8.6), 100 mM Potassium phosphate, and
0.2 mM EDTA) for 2 h at room temperature (24°C). 10
μl of 200 mM glutamine was then added prior to a 20
min incubation at 37°C. The reaction was quenched with
the addition of 10 μl of 0.6 M HCl. The reaction mixture
was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature
(24°C) with 100 μl of the assay mix B (3.7 U glutamate
dehydrogenase, 160 mM Tris-acetate (pH 9.4), 400 mM
hydrazine, 5 mM ADP, and 2 mM nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide) and the absorbance read at 340 nm using an
Infinite 200 microplate reader (Tecan, Durham, NC).

The protein:inhibitor complex was prepared by
incubating cKGA (2 mg/ml) with inhibitors (1:10 molar
ratio; final concentration of 5% DMSO) at 4°C for 1 h.
The complex was then concentrated to 20 mg/ml before
crystallization screening using the vapor diffusion
method. Crystals for cKGA–CB839 was obtained with
0.1 M Bis-Tris propane (pH 7), 3% DMSO and 1.8 M
LiSO4. cKGA–trans-CBTBP crystals were obtained
with 0.1 M Bis-Tris propane (pH 7), 4% DMSO and 2
M LiSO4. The crystals were cryopreserved in reservoir
solution supplemented with 15% glycerol. For both
complexes, the diffraction data sets were collected at
the synchrotron beamline 13B1 (wavelength 1.000 Å)
at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Centre
(NSRRC, Taiwan). Data sets were processed and scaled
using HKL2000 [43].

Glutaminase assay with 293T cell line
A glutaminase assay was performed using the twostep procedure as described previously [42]. Confluent
293T cells grown in 12-well plate were transfected with
cKGA plasmid and incubated with the indicated inhibitors
for 24 h. Cells were lysed with 100 μl of Hepes buffer

Structure solution and refinement
Structures of the cKGA:inhibitor complexes were
obtained by molecular replacement with the program
Phaser-MR [44] using the coordinates of apo cKGA
57951

Oncotarget

as the search model (Protein data bank, 3VOY). The
restraints for the inhibitors were generated using eLBOW
program [45, 46]. The model was examined and built in
COOT [46] and subsequent refinement was carried out
with Phenix-refine [47]. The electron density for the
cKGA gating loop (316LRFNKL321) region is disordered
in 1S, 3S-CBTBP and CB-839 inhibitor complex
structures, and was not modeled [48]. The final structures
for cKGA:1S, 3S-CBTBP and cKGA:CB-839 were
refined up to 2.74 Å and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively
(Table 1). The overall geometry of the final model was
analyzed using a Ramachandran plot with the program
PROCHECK [49].
