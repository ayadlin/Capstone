ABSTRACT
Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 9 (CASC9) is a novel gene generating long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) with oncogenic potential that was first identified in esophageal
cancer. In this study, we have found that CASC9 was overexpressed in gastric cancer
(GC) compared to normal gastric tissue. A higher expression level was associated with
aggressive pathological characteristics, including deep invasion, poor differentiation and
lymph node metastases. In two gastric cancer cell lines, BGC823 and SGC7901, CASC9
were both overexpressed compared to that of normal gastric epithelial cell (GES-1).
Moreover, the expression of CASC9 was even higher in BGC823/DR and SGC7901/DR cells
that are resistant to paclitaxel or adriamycin. CASC9 knockdown inhibited proliferation
and promoted cell apoptosis In BGC823/DR and SGC7901/DR cells. The invasion potential
was also significantly inhibited measured by Transwell assay. In addition, CASC9
knockdown in BGC823/DR and SGC7901/DR cells restored chemosensitivity to paclitaxel
and adriamycin. This was associated with decreased expression of multidrug resistance
1 (MDR1) protein. Taken together, our data suggest that expression of lncRNA CASC9
correlated with aggressive pathological characteristics of GC, it may serve as a potential
oncogene to regulate proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance of GC cells.

INTRODUCTION

Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 9 (CASC9) gene is
located at 8q21.11, it encodes a lncRNA. The gene was
first reported in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(ESCC), where it regulates migration and invasion of the
cancer cells [10]. By using microarray assays, we have
found that CASC9 was expressed nearly eightfold higher
in GC tissue than that of control normal gastric tissues. The
observation has prompted us to further study its role in cell
proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance. Our findings
suggest that CASC9 plays a significant role in these steps.
CASC9 may serve as a therapeutic target of GC.

Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common
solid malignant tumors [1]. Because locally advanced
GC has high a frequency of micrometastasis and relapse,
its prognosis is poor. The 5 years survival after radical
surgery was 30%~50%. Perioperative and adjuvant
chemotherapy have been shown to be able to decrease
distant metastasis and improve survival by 10–15% [2–4].
Chemoresistance likely has contributed to the relapse after
chemotherapy. It is crucial to understand the underlying
mechanism of chemoresistance and find novel therapeutic
targets to further improve the outcome of GC.
Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a type of
endogenous RNA that is not translated to protein. Over
the past ten years, the research in lncRNA has progressed
rapidly. LncRNAs could act as transcriptional regulators
for many genes, and participate in key steps of cancer
proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance [5–7]. A few
lncRNAs have been proposed to act as oncogenes or tumor
suppressor genes in malignant tumors [8, 9].

specimens from the same patients (Figure 1A). This
observation was further confirmed by qRT-PCR in 89 GC
tissues, compared with control NST, the expression of
CASC9 in 89 GC tissues was significantly higher (3.34 ± 0.24,
P < 0.05, Figure 1B). The expression of CASC9 in gastric
cancer cell lines, BGC823 and SGC7901 cells (4.21 ± 0.25,
3.24 ± 0.20), were higher than that in control normal gastric
epithelial cells (GES-1) (P < 0.05, Figure 1B).
We have further analyzed the correlations between
CASC9 expression and clinical pathological characteristics
of GC. The expression levels of CASC9 were associated
with increased tumor size, depth of invasion, and number of
lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05, Table 1). The expression
levels of CASC9 were much higher in tumors of Borrmann
3 and 4 types, or tumors with poor differentiation, INFγinfiltrating pattern than in tumors of Borrman 1 and 2
type, or tumors with well or moderate differentiation, and
INFα/β-infiltrating pattern (P < 0.05). These results suggest
that CASC9 may play a role in tumor progression and
metastasis of GC.

CASC9 knockdown inhibited chemoresistance in
drug-resistant GC cells
CASC9 knockdown in BGC823/DR and SGC7901/
DR cells resensitized them to paclitaxel: IC50 decreased
from 183.33 ± 0.41 μg/L and 146.54 ± 0.57 μg/L to
72.31 ± 0.28 μg/L and 58.62 ± 0.32 μg/L, respectively
(P < 0.05 Figure 3A). Similarly, CASC9 knockdown restored
their sensitivities to Adriamycin, IC50 decreased from
7.26 ± 0.21 μg/mL and 5.41 ± 0.14 μg/mL to 4.17 ± 0.19 μg/
mL and 2.28 ± 0.16 μg/mL, respectively (P < 0.05, Figure 3B).

CASC9 knockdown is associated with
downregulation of multidrug resistance 1
(MDR1) in drug-resistant GC cells
Based on the preliminary results of microarray assays
(data not shown), a positive correlation between CASC9
and MDR1 was suggested. We tested the expression level
of MDR1 in BGC823/DR and SGC7901/DR cells before
and after CASC9 knockdown by Western blots. As a matter
of fact, knockdown of CASC9 was associated decreased
expression of MDR1 (Figure 3C, P < 0.05.

CASC9 was up-regulated in GC drug-resistant
cell lines
The IC50 of paclitaxel in BGC823/DR and SGC7901/
DR cells were 183.33 ± 0.41 μg/L and 146.54 ± 0.57 μg/L,
respectively, significantly higher than that in BGC823 and
SGC7901 cells , 41.52 ± 0.27 μg/L and 33.28 ± 0.24 μg/L,
respectively (P < 0.05). The calculated resistance indexs
(RI) were 4.42 and 4.40.
The IC50 of adriamycin BGC823/DR and SGC7901/
DR cells were 7.26 ± 0.21 μg/mL and 5.41 ± 0.14 μg/mL,
respectively, significantly higher than that in BGC823 and
SGC7901 cells 3.02 ± 0.18 μg/mL and 1.52 ± 0.13 μg/mL,
respectively(P < 0.05). The IC50 in drug-resistant cells was
much higher, their resistance index (RI) were 2.41 and 3.55.
The BGC823/DR and SGC7901/DR cells are
resistant to paclitaxel and Adriamycin at tested levels. The
expression of CASC9 expression were significantly higher
in drug-resistant BGC823/DR and SGC7901/DR cells
(6.95 ± 0.31, 5.38 ± 0.34, P < 0.05, Figure 1B). These
results suggest that CASC9 overexpresion is associated
chemoresistance of GC.

DISCUSSION
CASC9 was originally found in ESCC by nextgeneration sequencing and bioinformatics analyses
[11], higher expression level of CASC9 was found to
be correlated with poor differentiation of ESCC [10].
Interestingly, high expression level of CASC9 was
also found in GC specimen by microarray analysis.
The overexpression remains to be true in the two well
established gastric cell lines, BGC823 and SGC7901, but
not in the normal gastric epithelial cells, suggesting that it
may potentially promote cell growth. In fact, in GC tumor
specimens, higher expression level of CASC9 correlated
well with increased tumor size, depth of tumor invasion,
and number of lymph node metastasis, Borrmann 3 or
4 subtypes, poor differentiation, and INFγ infiltrating
pattern. Silencing the expression of CASC9 by pS-CASC9
transfection not only inhibited the proliferation, promoted
apoptosis in BGC823/DR and SGC7901/DR cells, but
also inhibited their invasion potential by Transwell assay.
The underlying mechanism as to how CASC9 promote
proliferation remains to be elucidated. LncRNA regulates
the expression and function of downstream genes through
a variety of ways. Li P et al. reported that lncRNA
CASC2 suppresses the proliferation of gastric cancer
cells by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway [12].
Our previous study showed that another lncRNA, TUSC7
(tumor suppressor candidate 7), was targeted and inhibited

CASC9 knockdown inhibited the growth and
invasion of drug-resistant GC cells
To evaluate whether manipulation of CASC9 will
affect the growth and invasion of drug-resistant GC cells,
cells stably expressing CASC9 silencing vector were
established, and the knockdown was confirmed by qRTPCR (P < 0.05, Figure 2A).
As shown in Figure 2B and 2C, CASC9 knockdown
inhibited cell growth of both BGC823/DR and SGC7901/
DR cells (P < 0.05). Flow cytometry revealed that
CASC9 knockdown is associated with significantly

gene in glioma cells [5]. We speculate that CASC9 might
play its role in GC through regulating the expression of
its target genes, our ongoing studies will shed light in the
future on the underlying mechanisms.
The expression of CASC9 was further upregulated

involved in chemoresistance of GC cells. As a matter

chemoresistance to paclitaxel and Adriamycin in BGC823/

correlation between the level of CASC9 and MDR1

needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms.
In conclusion, lncRNA CASC9 is frequently
overexpressed in GC, it may promote cell growth and

Mini Kit (Qiagen p/n 74104). Human 8 x 60K LncRNA
expression array purchased from KangchengBio
Corporation (Shanghai, China) was used for the determine
the lncRNAs/mRNAs expression profiles. RNA was
labeled with Quick Amp Labeling Kit One-Color (Agilent
p/n 5190-0442), re-purified with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen
p/n 74104) and measured by NanoDrop ND-1000. Equal
amount of RNA was then hybridized with Agilent Gene
Expression Hybridization Kit (Agilent p/n 5188-5242).
Following repeated washing, the arrays were scanned
and the data were extracted by using Agilent Feature
Extraction Software.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical specimens
Total of 89 GC and paired control normal stomach
tissues (NST) were obtained from the First Affiliated
Hospital of China Medical University from Feb 2016
to Aug 2016. The tissue samples were stored in liquid
nitrogen. The clinicopathological data was confirmed by
pathologist. The Ethics Committees of China Medical
University approved this study, and research consents were
given by the patients before the study.

Cell culture
Human gastric cancer BGC823 and SGC7901 cells
and normal gastric epithelial cell GES-1 were purchased
from China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Drugresistant BGC823/DR and SGC7901/DR were preserved
in our laboratory. Those cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco,
Carlsbad, CA, USA)at 37°C with 5% CO2 according to our
previous study [13].

0.5 μg/mL, 5 μg/mL, 50 μg/mL) 24 h later [13, 15]. After 48 h,
the cellular viability was evaluated, and the dose-response
curve was drawn to calculate the half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) using a Probit regression model.

Total RNA was harvested with TRIzol reagent
(Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and
reverse transcribed to cDNA using Reverse-Transcription
Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). One Step SYBR RTPCR Kit (TaKaRa, Japan) was used to detect the CASC9
expression in GC tissues and cell lines according to
manufacturer’s protocol. Relative CASC9 expression
was quantified with the relative quantitative method
relative to GAPDH level. The primers of CASC9 were
5'- AGATGAAGCCGGTACCTCAGAT -3' (sense) and
5'- TCACTTTAAAGAGGGAGAGGAG -3' (antisense).

Cell invasion assay
Cell invasion assay was conducted by Transwell
chamber (Costar, Corning, NY, USA) with polycarbonic
membrane (6.5mmin diameter, 8 μm pore size) and Matrigel
(BD, NJ, USA). The Transwell membrane was coated with
80 μL of Matrigel solution (500 ng/μL; BD, Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA) and incubated at 37°C for 4 h. The transfected
cells were resuspended in 100 μL serum-free medium
at a density of 5 × 105 cells/mL and added in the upper
chamber. 600 μL of DMEM/high-glucose or DMEM/F12
medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to the
lower chamber. After incubation for 48 h, cells above the
membrane surface were mechanically removed. Cells that
had invaded to the lower side of the membrane were fixed
with methanol and stained with 20% Giemsa. Stained cells
were counted under a microscope in five randomly chosen
fields and the average number was calculated.

Vector construction and transfection
The silence vector pS-CASC9 and empty pSilencer
(NC) were obtained from Fitgene Company (Guangzhou,
China). pS-CASC9 and pS-NC were transfected with
Lipofectamine 3000 Reagent (Invitrogen, Foster City,
CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol after
24 h of culture. G418 (Invitrogen, Foster City, CA, USA)
was used to select cell lines stably expressing the vectors,
and qRT-PCR was used to confirm and measure the
konckdown. Eight passages had been passed by the time
of conducting the experiment.

Measurement of apoptosis

Proliferation and chemotherapy resistance assay

Cell apoptosis rate was quantified using Annexin
V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Biosci, Hangzhou, China)
with flow cytometry according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Data was analyzed according to our previous report [5].

Cellular proliferation was measured by MTT assay
according to our previous study [14]. Cells were seeded
into 96-well plates with 3000 cells per well and treated
