ABSTRACT
Background: To date, there is no effective therapy for patients with advanced/
metastatic adrenocortical cancer (ACC). The activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin
signaling is frequent in ACC and this pathway is a promising therapeutic target.
Aim: To investigate the effects of the inhibition of the Wnt/beta-catenin in ACC cells.
Methods: Adrenal (NCI-H295 and Y1) and non-adrenal (HeLa) cell lines were
treated with PNU-74654 (5–200 μM) for 24–96 h to assess cell viability (MTS-based
assay), apoptosis (Annexin V), expression/localization of beta-catenin (qPCR,
immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry and western blot), expression of
beta-catenin target genes (qPCR and western blot), and adrenal steroidogenesis
(radioimmunoassay, qPCR and western blot).
Results: In NCI-H295 cells,PNU-74654 significantly decreased cell proliferation
96 h after treatment, increased early and late apoptosis, decreased nuclear betacatenin accumulation, impaired CTNNB1/beta-catenin expression and increased betacatenin target genes 48 h after treatment. No effects were observed on HeLa cells.
In NCI-H295 cells, PNU-74654 decreased cortisol, testosterone and androstenedione
secretion 24 and 48 h after treatment. Additionally, in NCI-H295 cells, PNU-74654
decreased SF1 and CYP21A2 mRNA expression as well as the protein levels of STAR
and aldosterone synthase 48 h after treatment. In Y1 cells, PNU-74654 impaired
corticosterone secretion 24 h after treatment but did not decrease cell viability.
Conclusions: Blocking the Tcf/beta-catenin complex inhibits the ­Wnt/­beta-catenin
signaling in adrenocortical tumor cells triggering increased apoptosis, decreased
cell viability and impairment of adrenal steroidogenesis. These promising findings
pave the way for further experiments inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in
pre-clinical models of ACC. The inhibition of this pathway may become a promising
adjuvant therapy for patients with ACC.

achieved in recent years both in basic and clinical research,
adjuvant therapeutic options for patients with ACC remain
very limited [3]. Mitotane (M), the first line adjuvant
treatment, is highly toxic and its combination with
etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (EDP) is generally
ineffective and almost all patients will experience disease

INTRODUCTION
The management of patients with adrenocortical
carcinomas (ACCs) remains a challenge and patients
with invasive, metastatic or recurrent disease have a poor
prognosis [1, 2]. Although significant progress has been

progression [4]. New molecular targeted therapies have
been successfully developed for various types of cancers
but not for ACCs. Thus, better treatments are urgently
necessary.
Several genetic abnormalities have been found
in these tumors, the most prominent being IGF2
overexpression [5–7] and mutations in TP53 and CTNNB1
(the beta-catenin gene) in both adult and pediatric
adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) [8–10]. Transcriptome
studies have shown that ACCs are clustered within
different sets of poor prognosis for adult ACC patients
according to TP53 or CTNNB1 abnormalities [10].
Accordingly, overexpression of beta-catenin in ACCs
has been correlated with a worse prognosis [11]. Exon 3
CTNNB1 mutations have been found in 15–36% and 6%
of adult and pediatric ACTs, respectively [8, 9, 12–15].
We previously showed that activation of both canonical
and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways are common
in ACTs with or without CTNNB1 mutations [8, 9].
The hypothesis that the Wnt pathway can be activated
through other mechanisms than CTNNB1 mutations has
been recently reinforced. A large-scale high-resolution
analysis study showed that variations in ZNRF3, which
is a Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibitor, were the most
common genetic defect found in a large number of ACC
samples. ACCs presenting ZNRF3 variants showed
transcriptional activation of beta-catenin target genes
[16]. Thus, activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway
triggered by CTNNB1 and ZNRF3 mutations or down
regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin inhibitors are important
for ACC pathogenesis. Therefore, inhibition of the Wnt/
beta-catenin signaling is a rational option and may become
a promising approach.
CTNNB1 mutations found in ACCs are located
at residues involved in phosphorylation, which are
essential sites for beta-catenin degradation by ubiquitin/
proteasome signaling. Therefore, mutations in these
sites lead to beta-catenin accumulation in the nucleus,
where it binds with the T cell factor (Tcf) and enhances
its transcriptional activity [15]. The NCI-H295 cell line
is an immortalized adrenocortical-secreting carcinoma
lineage derived from an adult patient [17]. Remarkably,
this cell line harbors the CTNNB1 p.S45P mutation, thus
representing a good in vitro model of ACC showing
Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation [14, 15]. Highthroughput screening identified small molecules that
antagonize the Tcf/beta-catenin complex and inhibit
the growth of tumor cell lines [18]. Among Tcf/betacatenin antagonists, PKF115-584 has been reported to
inhibit proliferation of the NCI-H295R cell line and the
expression of the beta-catenin target genes cyclin D1 and
c-Myc [19].
The PNU-74654 (PNU) compound is a non-FDAapproved drug which prevents that Tcf from binding to
beta-catenin, acting as a Wnt/beta-catenin antagonist
(Figure 1). This small molecule was found by virtual
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

screening and confirmed by biophysical screening
to  interfere with protein-protein interactions [20].
Beta-catenin tightly binds to Tcf through a hot spot
site. By binding to the same site, PNU can compete with
Tcf. A luciferase activity assay for Tcf transactivation
showed specific inhibition in the presence of PNU,
confirming that this drug-like compound is an effective
Wnt pathway antagonist [20].
Taken together, these data suggest that the Wnt/
beta-catenin pathway might be a potential targeted therapy
for patients with ACC. Tcf/beta-catenin antagonism may
be useful to treat patients with ACC exhibiting increased
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. In the present study, we
assessed the in vitro effect of PNU on adrenocortical
tumor cells. Our results showed that inhibition of the
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling resulted in a significantly
decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis and impaired
steroidogenesis.

RESULTS
Authentication and sequencing analysis of exon
3 CTNNB1 and TP53 coding regions in cell lines
NCI-H295 and HeLa authenticity was confirmed
by STR profiling (Supplementary Table 1). In our
own stock of NCI-H295 cells, we confirmed the
presence of the pathogenic p.S45P CTNNB1 variation.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that, under basal
conditions, beta-catenin is highly expressed in the
cytoplasm and nucleus of NCI-H295 cells (Figure 2a–2c).
This finding confirms that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway
is activated in NCI-H295 cells. In addition, we also
detected the presence of the p.P278L TP53 variation in
this cell line.
HeLa, a cervix carcinoma cell lineage, was
employed as a non-adrenal cell line that did not carry
the exon 3 CTNNB1 mutation but which also showed
the p.P72R TP53 variation as well as a second intronic
TP53 variation (c.97-30C > A/g.11298). Additionally, we
identified an intronic TP53 variation at position c.74 +
38 (C > G rs1642785) in HeLa cells. These results are
summarized in Supplementary Table 2.

Inhibition of the Tcf/beta-catenin complex
induced by PNU impairs cell viability in human
adrenocortical cell lines but not in mouse
adrenal cell lines and human non-adrenal cell
lines and prevents cell proliferation by Forskolin
stimulation (Figures 3 and 4)
PNU impaired NCI-H295 cell viability. NCI-H295
cell viability was decreased 24 and 48 h after treatment
with 100 and 200 μM PNU (Figure 3a–3b) and 72 h after
treatment with 10, 100 and 200 μM PNU (Figure 3c).

Figure 1: Wnt pathway signaling and PNU-74654 effect on the Tcf/beta-catenin complex. A. When Wnt signaling is

activated, the Wnt ligand binds to the Frizzled (Fzd) receptor and LRP5/6 (LRP) co-receptor and stimulates LRP5/6 phosphorylation with
the help of Dishevelled (DVL). Phosphorylated LRP recruits Axin to the membrane and disrupts the beta-catenin degradation complex.
Beta-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and enters into the nucleus, where it binds to Tcf/Lef and co-activators triggering Wnt target
gene transcription. PNU-74654, a drug-like compound, disrupts the beta-catenin/Tcf complex and arrests Wnt target gene transcription.
B. When Wnt signaling is not activated (either by Wnt ligand sequestration by sFRPs and/or LRP5/6 inhibition by DKK3), cytoplasmic
beta-catenin is phosphorylated by the beta-catenin degradation complex consisting of APC, Axin, GSK3beta and CKIα. Phosphorylated
beta-catenin is then recognized by beta-Trcp and is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Lower doses of PNU were able to decrease cell viability
96 h after treatment: 22, 27, 50 and 97% with 10, 50,
100 and 200 μM, respectively (ANOVA: p < 0.0001;
Figure 3d).
PNU did not decrease HeLa cell viability
96  h after treatment compared to vehicle (p = 0.05;
Figure  3e). Interestingly, PNU showed a weak effect
48 h after treatment, but this effect was observed only
at a concentration of 200 μM (ANOVA: p = 0.01;
Supplementary Figure 1).
PNU did not decrease Y1 cell viability 48 h after
treatment (Figure 3f). We chose to evaluate these cells up
to 48 h and not at 96 h because they grow much faster than
NCI-H295 cells under culture.

As expected, 10 μM Forskolin increased cell
proliferation by approximately 50% compared with
vehicle (p = 0.0008; Figure 4). In turn, association
of 5,  10 and 50 μM PNU with Forskolin prevented
Forskolin-induced cell proliferation 96 h after treatment
(Figure 4).

Inhibition of the Tcf/beta-catenin complex
induced by PNU increased NCI-H295 cell
apoptosis (Figure 5)
PNU treatment at the concentrations 10, 50 and
100 μM resulted in a dose-dependent increase (19%,
51% and 80%, respectively) of late apoptotic cells 48 h

in an increase (18%, 60% and 31%, respectively) of
early apoptotic cells 48 h after treatment (Figure 5a and

after PNU treatment at the concentrations of 10, 50

Y1 cells under basal conditions (Supplementary Figure 2).
This result supports the idea that the Y1 cell line does not
present Wnt/beta-catenin activation.

Under basal conditions, NCI-H295 cells retain the
ability to secrete adrenal steroids [21]. Overall, PNU
treatment significantly impaired adrenal steroidogenesis by
decreasing steroid production and the mRNA expression
of steroidogenesis-related genes in NCI-H295 cells. PNU

lines. In addition, we provided evidence that PNU may
directly impair adrenal steroid secretion. To date, there is
no effective adjuvant therapy for patients with advanced
or metastatic ACCs. Very recently, a phase II clinical trial
involving the suppression of the IGF system was tested
in ACC patients but unfortunately the results were rather
disappointing [22]. Hence, new approaches based on
molecular targeted therapies are suitable.
Abnormal activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin
pathway plays an important role in adrenocortical
tumorigenesis [8, 10, 12, 15, 23]. Actually, Wnt/betacatenin-related abnormalities appear to be the most
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

common molecular signature of these tumors [8–10,
12, 14–16, 24]. In addition, beta-catenin constitutive
activation in mice results in adrenal glands with malignant
characteristics, such as uncontrolled neovascularization
and loco-regional metastatic invasion [25]. In agreement,
a previous study confirmed overexpression of Wnt target
genes in ACTs harboring beta-catenin mutations as well as
in the adrenal cell lineage NCI-H295. In that study, 24 h
treatment with Wnt inhibitors, 10 μM PKF115-584 and
100 μM PNU, resulted in decreased beta-catenin target
gene transcription [24]. However, the impact of these
compounds on apoptosis, cell viability and steroidogenesis

has not been assessed. Our study investigated in depth the
effects of PNU on cell viability over a longer period of
time (96 h). Moreover, we also determined its effects on
apoptosis and adrenal steroidogenesis.
A previous study had shown that PKF115-584,
currently called Calphostin C, dose-dependently inhibited
beta-catenin-dependent transcription and H295R
proliferation, and induced entry of cells into the S phase
[19]. However the topological polar surface of PKF115584 is 194 square angstrom (Å2), higher than recommended
for good absorption (less than 140 Å2), characterizing this
compound as poorly absorbed by cells [26]. On the other
hand, the topological surface of PNU-74654 is 63.8 Å2
causing this compound to be very well absorbed by cells
for a better effect on Wnt signaling inhibition (National
Center for Biotechnology Information. PubChem
Compound Database; CID = 60119583, https://pubchem.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/60119583 (accessed Aug.
12, 2015).) [27]. In our study, PNU was able to decrease
cell viability since 24 h after treatment at higher but
apparently non-cytotoxic concentrations (100 μM). After
a longer time of treatment (72 h and 96 h) this effect was
achieved even with a lower dose (10 μM). Additionally,
we analyzed the impact of this drug under conditions of
stimulation with Forskolin, which has a potent effect on
adrenal cell proliferation. Forskolin alone increased cell
proliferation by approximately 50%. In contrast, PNU
prevented the cell proliferation stimulated by Forskolin.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The effects of PNU appear to be partially specific for cells
carrying Wnt/beta-catenin activation. Our results showed
that PNU does not decrease cell proliferation in cells that
do not carry exon 3 beta-catenin mutations, such as HeLa,
a non-adrenal cell line, as previously reported, and Y1, a
mouse adrenal tumor cell line [19].
In NCI-H295 cells, the analysis of apoptosis 48 h
after PNU treatment showed a dose-dependent increase
of apoptotic cells. These data support the proposal
that inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling impairs
cell proliferation mostly by increasing early and late
apoptosis. In agreement, Doghman et al. showed that
Wnt/beta-catenin inhibition by PKF115-584 repressed
the entry of H295R cells into the S phase and induced
their apoptosis [19]. In addition, an increase of TUNELpositive cells, which indicates the presence of apoptotic
cells, was described in Sf1/Crelowbeta-catenin knockout
mice, supporting the idea that the loss of beta-catenin in
the adrenal cortex progressively contributes to the loss of
adrenocortical tissue via apoptosis [28].
We found reduced expression of beta-catenin at
the mRNA and protein level 48 h after PNU treatment.
In addition, we also found a reduction of nuclear betacatenin accumulation in PNU-treated cells, as shown by
immunofluorescence. Similarly, to previous data, our
results show that shorter exposure to PNU (24 h) did not
affect beta-catenin expression [24]. In agreement with our
results, it has been reported that PNU was able to decrease

beta-catenin protein expression in juvenile zebrafish after
10 days of exposure [29]. Taken together, these data
show that PNU might have a later effect and appears to
require a prolonged exposure to affect gene and protein
expression. Thus, PNU may directly decrease beta-catenin
expression as well as its nuclear localization by directly
binding to beta-catenin. Interestingly, this effect occurred
48 h after treatment with 10 and 50 μM PNU, even before
the reduction of cell viability. This finding suggests that
increased cell proliferation in adrenal tumor cells is driven,
at least in part, by increased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling,
as suggested by transgenic mouse model studies [25]. In
addition, silencing beta-catenin reduced cell proliferation
in H295R in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model [30].
We also observed that PNU led to increased mRNA
expression of the beta-catenin target genes CCND1
and AXIN2. In agreement, it has been shown that the Wnt/
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

beta-catenin pathway inhibition resulted in increased
AXIN2 mRNA expression in endometrial cells [31].
Furthermore, our data suggest a potential effect on betacatenin-dependent transcription, a mechanism of action
that has been reported for other inhibitors of the Tcf/betacatenin complex [18,  32]. The absence of an effect of
PNU on MYC mRNA, a well-known beta-catenin target
gene, supports the hypothesis that MYC overexpression is
common in many cancers but not in ACTs [8, 33]. TCF7
mRNA expression did not change in response to PNU
treatment, supporting the hypothesis that this drug directly
interferes with the Tcf/beta-catenin interaction [20].
The majority of ACCs secrete excessive amounts
of cortisol, androgens or both, resulting in significant
morbidity associated with excess hormone production
[3]. Thus, an adjuvant therapy that, in addition to having
antitumoral effects, is also able to directly decrease
43026

Oncotarget

excessive hormone secretion is highly desirable [34].
Therefore, we also investigated the effects of inhibiting
the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling on steroid production and
steroidogenic enzyme gene expression. PNU treatment
resulted in decreased cortisol, testosterone and, to a lesser
extent, androstenedione secretion. Interestingly, adrenal
steroidogenesis was impaired as early as 24 h after
treatment, a time point where no decreased cell viability
was yet observed. Hence, these results point to a potential
direct effect of PNU on adrenal steroid secretion. This
hypothesis is supported by the fact that PNU elicited
reduction of corticosterone secretion but not of cell
viability in Y1 cells. At higher doses it is also likely that
the effect of PNU on cell decrease may contribute in part
to decreased hormone production. On the other hand, we
found that PNU treatment impaired the mRNA expression
of SF1 and CYP21A2, both important genes required for
steroidogenesis, suggesting that PNU directly impairs
adrenal steroid secretion by inhibiting the initial steps of
steroidogenesis.
SF1 is required for StAR gene expression, which
is an early and limiting step in normal steroidogenesis.
Accordingly, the finding of impaired StAR protein levels
after PNU treatment in NCI-H295 cells reinforces this
hypothesis [35, 36]. In addition, PNU treatment also
decreased the protein levels of aldosterone synthase,
encoded by the CYP11B2 gene. This result agrees with
data reported by Berthon et al (2014), who showed
that the inhibition of the Wnt pathway decreased
hormone secretion, CYP11B2 and CYP21 expression
after angiotensin stimulation [37]. Our findings support
previous data regarding the importance of the Wnt/betacatenin signaling in adrenal cortex homeostasis [28].
Mouse studies have suggested a critical role for betacatenin in the maintenance of adrenal cortex progenitor
cells. Partial knockout of beta-catenin in the adrenal
cortex resulted in depletion of adrenocortical cells
upon aging [30]. On the other hand, it has been recently
suggested that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling may
control adrenal homeostasis by inhibiting fasciculata
differentiation and promoting the undifferentiated
state of progenitor cells, resulting in suppression of
steroidogenesis [38].
There are some possible limitations to the
present study. We evaluated the effects of PNU only
on immortalized tumor cell lines, which are known to
have possibly accumulated additional genetic defects
and chromosomal instability over time. However, the
NCI-H295 lineage is a good surrogate model for the
analysis of the effect of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
inhibition on ACC since it harbors the p.S45P betacatenin mutation, as confirmed in our own stock of cells.
This mutation leads to the activation of the constitutive
Wnt/beta-catenin pathway [14, 15]. In addition, this
lineage retains the ability to produce adrenal steroids,
permitting the assessment of the effects of experimental
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatments on hormonal secretion [17, 21]. One could
argue that the PNU doses used were excessively high,
namely the dose of 200 μM and possibly the dose of 100
μM, resulting in cytotoxic effects. However, these high
doses did not result in cytotoxic effects in non-adrenal
cells, such as HeLa, or in Y1 mouse adrenal cells.
Furthermore, lower doses (10 and 50 μM) were able to
impair H295 cell viability 96 h after treatment. These
findings suggest a specific effect on cells exhibiting
increased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. In addition, we
only evaluated in vitro effects and the results of this study
do not ensure that the same effect will be obtained in in
vivo models. The use of agents suppressing this pathway
in clinical practice must be very cautious in view of
toxicity and side effects since the Wnt signaling is a
ubiquitous signaling pathway [32].
In conclusion, the results of this in vitro study
demonstrated that blocking the Tcf/beta-catenin complex
inhibited the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling as shown
by decreased beta-catenin expression and nuclear
accumulation, and impaired expression of beta-catenin
target genes. These effects resulted in increased apoptosis,
decreased tumor cell viability, and impairment of adrenal
steroidogenesis. These promising findings may pave
the way for further experiments inhibiting this pathway
in pre-clinical models of ACCs. Taken together, these
lines of evidence indicate that inhibitors of the Wnt/betacatenin complex may become useful for the individualized
treatment of patients with ACC presenting increased Wnt/
beta-catenin signaling.

observer inverted microscope, Carl Zeiss, Germany).

Cell proliferation assay
The CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (Promega Corporation, Madison,
WI, USA), an MTS-based assay, was used to determine
cell viability before and after treatment with PNU.
Briefly, cells were plated on 96-well plates at a density
of 20,000  cells/well (NCI-H295) or 10,000 cells/well,
incubated for 24 h (Y1 and HeLa) and 48 h (NCI-H295)
and then treated with 5, 10, 50, 100 and 200 μM PNU
in triplicate. After 24, 48, 72 and 96 h of incubation for
NCI-H295 cells, 24 and 48 h of incubation for Y1 cells
and 48 and 96 h of incubation for HeLa cells, 20 μL of
CellTiter 96® Aqueous Solution was added to each well
and incubated for 1–3 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 according
to the manufacturer’s datasheet. Absorbance at 490 nm
was obtained from a microplate reader (BioRad). At least
three independent experiments were performed for each
cell line.

RNA isolation and qPCR

Stimulation of cell proliferation with forskolin

Total RNA from NCI-H295 cells was isolated using
TRIzol® according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Life
Technologies). RNA concentrations were quantified by
spectrometry (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). RNA integrity was checked
according to the 28S/18S ratio, with an acceptable
range of 1.6 to 2.0 and confirmed by 1.2% agarose gel
electrophoresis. mRNA was reverse transcribed from
500 ng of total RNA using the High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription kit and MultiScribe® enzyme (Life
Technologies).
For quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR), TaqMan®
assays (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) were
used according to the manufacturer’s recommendation
using cDNA (diluted 1:5) as template. TaqMan® assays
for NCI-H295 and HeLa cells: CTNNB1 (Hs00170025_
m1), CCND1 (Hs00765553_m1), AXIN2 (Hs00610344_
m1), MYC (Hs00153408_m1), TCF7 (Hs00175273_m1),
NR5A1/SF1 (Hs00610436_m1) and CYP21A2 (Custom:
AIVI3LV). TaqMan® assay for Y1 cells: Ctnnb1
(Mm01350391_m1). Relative expression values
were determined by the 2−ΔΔCt method using GUSB
(ID: 4326320E) as endogenous control.

To analyze the impact of PNU under conditions of
stimulation with Forskolin, NCI-H295 cells were plated on
96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well, incubated
for 48 h and then stimulated with 10 μM Forskolin (Sigma
Aldrich) and treated with 5, 10, 50, 100 and 200 μM PNU
in triplicate. After 96 h of stimulation/treatment, 20 μL of
CellTiter 96® Aqueous Solution was added to each well
and incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 according to
the manufacturer’s datasheet. Absorbance at 490 nm was
obtained from a microplate reader. Three independent
experiments were performed.

Detection of apoptosis with annexin V-FITC
(flow cytometry)
NCI-H295 cells were plated at 350,000 cells per
well in 6-well plates in triplicate. After 48 h, cells were
treated with vehicle (0.08%, 0.16% and 0.32% DMSO)
or with 10, 50 and 100 μM PNU. After 48 h, cells were
harvested, triplicates were pooled, washed once in 0.01
M PBS and suspended in binding buffer (Sigma Aldrich)
at a minimum of 1.106 total cells and assayed according
to manufacturer’s recommendations (Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis Detection Kit, Sigma Aldrich).
The procedure basically consists of the binding
of annexin V-FITC to phosphatidylserine in the cell
membranes, which are beginning the apoptotic process,
and the binding of propydium iodide to cellular DNA
in cells where the cell membrane has been totally
compromised. The cells were incubated with annexin
V-FITC and propydium iodide at room temperature for

Adrenal steroid measurement
Cortisol, testosterone and androstenedione
concentrations were measured in the supernatant of the
NCI-H295 cell medium and corticosterone concentrations
were measured in the supernatant of the Y1 cell medium
by radioimmunoassay (RIA) as previously described
