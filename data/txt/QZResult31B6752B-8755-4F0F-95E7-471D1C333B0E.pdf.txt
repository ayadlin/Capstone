miR-150: targeting MLL leukemia
Xi Jiang, Jianjun Chen
It has been a tough challenge to hunt for effective
therapeutic targets for acute leukemia bearing mixed
lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion genes. The MLL gene
which maps to human chromosome 11 band q23 (11q23)
is frequently involved in chromosome translocations
in around 10% of total leukemia, including 5-10% of
patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 80%
of infant acute leukemia. The critical feature of MLLrearrangements is the generation of a chimeric transcript
consisting of 5’ MLL and 3’ sequences of the partner
gene; at present, more than 100 different loci which
translocate to the MLL gene have been identified and
more than 60 different partner genes have been cloned
[1]. MLL-rearranged leukemia is usually associated
with intermediate to poor prognosis and refractory to
conventional therapies [1]. Therefore, it is urgent to
develop new therapeutic methods which have high
efficacy and low side-effects to treat MLL-rearranged
leukemia.
These MLL-fusions are the “drivers” that determine
the pathogenesis of the MLL-associated leukemias.
Several important oncogenes (e.g. homeobox A (HOXA)
genes, MEIS1, FLT3, MYB and MYC, etc.) serve as direct
or indirect downstream targets of MLL-fusion proteins and
are frequently up-regulated in MLL-associated leukemias.
In addition to sharing a common driver and contributing to
the pathogenesis of MLL-fusion-induced leukemia, these
oncogenes have complex mutual regulatory influences
on each other. For example, the HOXA cluster genes
are the most well-defined direct targets of MLL fusions;
MYB is an essential downstream target of the HOXA9/
MEIS1 signaling, and an autoregulatory feedback
loop was reported recently in which MYB binds MLL
through MENIN and regulates expression of HOXA9/
MEIS1 directly [2]; MYC, a potent oncogene which
transcriptionally activates many tumor-promoting genes
[3], is a downstream target gene of MLL fusions and FLT3
[4]; LIN28 is a direct target of MYC [5]. Taken together, a
functional circuit, “driven” by MLL-fusions and involving
all the above oncogenes (i.e. HOXA9, MEIS1, FLT3, MYB
and MYC), exists in MLL-associated leukemia. However,
how the MLL-pathway is regulated is unclear and this
question merits deep exploration.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small (22~25
bp) non-coding RNAs important in mediating posttranscriptional gene silencing, are involved in the
pathogenesis of various types of cancers [1]. Jiang et al.
[6] recently show that miR-150, a miRNA significantly

down-regulated in most AML cases, is up-regulated
by MLL-fusion/MYC at the primary transcription level
but strikingly, is repressed by MYC/LIN28 during the
maturation process. miR-150 functions as a critical
tumor suppressor in inhibiting MLL-fusion-induced cell
transformation and leukemogenesis, through directly
targeting MYB/FLT3 and thereby subsequently interfering
with the HOXA9/MEIS1/FLT3/MYB/MYC/LIN28 signaling
network. Collectively, this report describes a previously
unappreciated regulatory circuit, namely MLL-fusion/
MYC/LIN28⊣miR-150⊣ FLT3/MYB/HOXA9/MEIS1 in
MLL-associated leukemia, where miR-150 functions as a
pivotal tumor-suppressing gate keeper [6].
During the past two decades, many efforts have been
made to identify effective therapies targeting oncogenic
components of the above circuit, e.g. inhibitors for FLT3
and MYC [7, 8]. Given the essential role of miR-150 in
inhibiting MLL-fusion-mediated cell transformation
and leukemogenesis, and its remarkable repression of
expression of all major downstream oncogenic targets of
MLL fusions, restoring miR-150 expression/function holds
great therapeutic potential in treating MLL-associated
leukemia. Its side effect on normal hematopoiesis is
likely weak, as overexpression of miR-150 in normal
bone marrow progenitor cells results in only slight, if
any, inhibitory effect on cell proliferation [6]. Thus,
restoring the function of miR-150 by miRNA replacement
(e.g. packaged in nano-particles, etc.) may provide an
effective therapeutic strategy to treat MLL-associated
leukemia, either alone or in combination with suitable
chemotherapeutic drugs, or through synergy with future
available therapeutic compounds that specifically target
critical component(s) of the MLL-regulatory circuit such
as FLT3 or MYC.
Given the fact that miR-150 is significantly
downregulated in almost all subtypes of AML and its
forced expression exhibits a significant inhibitory effect
on cell transformation mediated by various types of
leukemic fusion genes, it would be important in the future
to systematically investigate miR-150’s pathologenic role
and critical target genes/pathways in other subtypes of
AML. It is also critical to determine whether the MYC/
LIN28⊣miR-150⊣FLT3/MYB/HOXA9/MEIS1 regulatory
circuit also exists and is functionally important as a whole
or at least in part in other subtypes of leukemia, or even
other types of cancers (e.g., lymphomas). Such studies
may lead to the ultimate development of highly effective
targeted therapy approaches to treat not only MLL1268

associated leukemia, but also other subtypes of leukemia
or even other types of cancers that also utilize at least part
of the aforementioned signaling circuit.
