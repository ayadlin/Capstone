Abstract
This study addresses the role of PTEN loss in intrinsic resistance to the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720.
Immunohistochemical staining of a tissue array covering all stages of melanocytic neoplasia (n ¼ 192) revealed
PTEN expression to be lost in >10% of all melanoma cases. Although PTEN expression status did not predict for
sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of PLX4720, it was predictive for apoptosis, with only limited cell death
observed in melanomas lacking PTEN expression (PTEN). Mechanistically, PLX4720 was found to stimulate
AKT signaling in the PTEN but not the PTENþ cell lines. Liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring
mass spectrometry (LC-MRM) was performed to identify differences in apoptosis signaling between the two cell
line groups. PLX4720 treatment significantly increased BIM expression in the PTENþ (>14-fold) compared with
the PTEN cell lines (four-fold). A role for PTEN in the regulation of PLX4720-mediated BIM expression was
confirmed by siRNA knockdown of PTEN and through reintroduction of PTEN into cells that were PTEN.
Further studies showed that siRNA knockdown of BIM significantly blunted the apoptotic response in PTENþ
melanoma cells. Dual treatment of PTEN cells with PLX4720 and a PI3K inhibitor enhanced BIM expression at
both the mRNA and protein level and increased the level of apoptosis through a mechanism involving AKT3 and
the activation of FOXO3a. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that loss of PTEN contributes to
intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance via the suppression of BIM-mediated apoptosis. Cancer Res; 71(7); 2750–60.

Introduction
One defining moment in our understanding of melanoma
initiation and progression was the discovery of activating
V600E mutations in BRAF in >50% of melanomas (1, 2). There
is now good evidence that mutated BRAF is a bona fide
therapeutic target in melanoma (3–5). A number of BRAFspecific small molecule kinase inhibitors have been developed

that are now undergoing intense preclinical and clinical
investigation (6, 7). In preclinical studies, the BRAF inhibitors
PLX4720 and PLX4032 potently inhibited BRAF kinase activity
in melanoma cells harboring the BRAF V600E mutation and
were cytostatic and cytotoxic in both in vitro cell culture
systems and in vivo xenograft melanoma models (5, 6, 8). This
promising preclinical activity was mirrored by a recent phase I
clinical trial of PLX4032 in advanced melanoma in which >80%
of patients showed some level of tumor regression (4).
Although most patients with BRAF V600E mutated melanoma
showed some response to PLX4032, 20% of those treated did
not meet the RECIST criteria threshold for a response (4, 9).
Although the mechanisms of intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance are not well understood, increased cyclin D1 expression
(in 17% of BRAF mutated melanomas) allows for cell cycle
entry when MAPK signaling is abrogated (10, 11). It is also
likely that constitutive activity in other pathways, such as
phospho-inositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, may contribute to
intrinsic resistance by limiting the apoptotic response (12,
13). One of the most critical negative regulators of AKT activity
is the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), which
hydrolyses PI-3,4,5-P3 to PI-4,5-P2, ultimately preventing the
phosphorylation of AKT (14). In this study, we identify loss of
PTEN expression, observed in >10% of melanoma specimens,
as being responsible for increased PI3K/AKT signaling when

Intrinsic BRAF Inhibitor Resistance

BRAF is inhibited. We further show that PTEN loss contributes
to the intrinsic resistance of BRAF V600E-mutated melanoma
cell lines to PLX4720 by suppressing the expression of the
proapoptotic protein BIM.
Cell culture and MTT assay
Melanoma cell lines were a gift from Dr. Meenhard Herlyn
(The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA) and were grown as
described in (8). MTT assays were performed as described in
ref. (15). The identity of the Wistar Institute cell lines was
confirmed using the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ) cell identity mapping kit. The M233 cell line was derived as described
in (16) and its identity confirmed by Biosynthesis Inc. by STR
validation analysis.
Generation of WM793TR-PTEN cell lines
Wild-type and G129E PTEN (phosphatase deficient)
human cDNAs were a gift from Dr. Bill Sellers (Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute; ref. 17). WM793TR-PTEN-wt, WM793TRPTEN-G129E, and WM793 cells overexpressing wild-type
BAD were a kind gift from Dr Andrew Aplin (Kimmel
Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). Inducible expression of
PTEN was obtained by treatment of cultures with doxycycline at a final concentration of 100 ng/mL. The WM793
cells stably expressing wild-type BAD were generated as
described in ref. (18).
Western blotting
Proteins were blotted for as described in ref. (15). The
antibodies to phospho-AKT (Ser473 and T308), total AKT,
phospho-BAD (S75 and S99), Bcl-2, BIM, BRAF, FOXO3a,
phospho-PDK1, total PDK1, PTEN, phospho-S6, and total S6
were from Cell Signaling Technology.
Flow cytometry
Cells were treated with 3 or 10 mmol/L PLX4720 for 24 or 48
hours or treated with PLX4720 (3 or 10 mmol/L) in the absence
or presence of GDC-0941 (3 mmol/L, Selleck Chemical Co.) and
harvested after 48 hours. Annexin-V/TMRM staining was
performed as described in ref. (19).
RNA interference
Cells were grown overnight in RPMI complete media. The
following day, complete media was replaced with OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and one of the following siRNA
sequences in complex with Lipofectamine 2,000 (Invitrogen): 50 nmol/L BRAF (Dharmacon), 20 nmol/L PTEN, 25
nmol/L BIM (Cell Signaling Technology). Scrambled siRNAs
at each concentration were also added as nontargeting
controls. A final concentration of 5% FBS in complete RPMI
was added the next day. Cells were transfected for a total of
48 to 72 hours before treatment with PLX4720
(3–10 mmol/L).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen's RNeasy mini kit. The
following TaqMan Gene Expression Assays primer/probes
were used: Hs00197982_m1 (BIM), P/N 4319413E (18S), and

www.aacrjournals.org

Hs99999905_m1 (GAPDH). The 18S þ GAPDH data were used
for normalizing BIM. After a 2-minute incubation at 50 C,
AmpliTaq Gold was activated by a 10-minute incubation at
95 C, followed by 40 PCR cycles consisting of 15 seconds of
denaturation at 95 C and hybridization of probe and primers
for 1 minute at 60 C. All standards and samples were tested in
triplicate wells and data were analyzed using SDS software
version 2.3.
Immunofluorescence staining
Cells were plated onto coverslips and treated with PLX4720
for 48 hours before being fixed and permeabilized as previously described (15) and imaged with a Leica confocal
microscope at 40 magnification.
3D spheroid assays
Collagen implanted spheroids were prepared using the
liquid overlay method (12) and were treated with 3 mmol/L
of PLX4720, 10 mmol/L LY294002, or both drugs in combination for 72 hours before being analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy as described in ref. (11). In other studies,
spheroids were treated for 72 hours, washed 3 times in
fresh media and allowed to recover for 120 hours before
analysis.
Immunohistochemical staining
A melanoma tissue array was generated from de-identified formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from
the Moffitt Pathology archives under a protocol approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the University of South
Florida. Slides were stained using the Ventana Discovery
XT automated system (Ventana Medical Systems) as per
manufacturer's protocol. The PTEN antibody (1:200,
#E4250, Spring Bioscience) was incubated for 32 minutes
and the pAKT antibody (1:20, #4051, Cell Signaling) was
incubated for 16 minutes. Slides were analyzed by 2 independent observers and consensus scored on a scale from
0 to þ3.
Liquid chromatography, multiple reaction monitoring
mass spectrometry (LC-MRM) analysis
Whole cell proteins extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE,
visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad) and
selected bands were excised. Following digestion, the internal
standard peptides were added in 2% acetonitrile. LC-MRM
analysis was performed as described in ref. (20) with 3
replicate analyses for each peptide. Quantification was
achieved by using the sum of the peak areas for all detected
transitions using Xcalibur QuanBrowser (Thermo). Relative
protein expression is determined using the ratio of peak area
of the native peptide to corresponding internal standard
(Supplementary Table S2).

lines had lower constitutive levels of pAKT (Ser473) compared
with the PTEN (Fig. 1A). Similar levels of pAKT (Thr308)
were observed in the PTEN and PTENþ cell lines. Analysis of
the growth inhibitory effects of PLX4720 by the MTT and
Alamar Blue assays (Fig. 1B and Supplemental Fig. S1) did not
reveal any statistically significant differences in the GI50 values
between the PTENþ and PTEN cell lines (P ¼ 0.48; Supplementary Fig. S2).
As increased PI3K/AKT signaling is known to limit apoptosis, we next measured PLX4720-induced apoptosis in our
PTEN/PTENþ melanoma cell line panel (Fig. 1C). Here we
observed that following PLX4720 treatment (3 and 10 mmol/L,
48 hours), the PTEN melanoma cell lines showed significantly less apoptosis than the PTENþ (*, P < 0.05: Fig. 1C).

PLX4720 mediated apoptosis was blocked by high doses (>75
mmol/L) of the capase inhibitor z-vad-fmak (Supplementary

We confirmed the incidence of PTEN loss in a tissue microarray containing a large sample of melanocytic neoplasms (n ¼

Results of immunohistochemical staining were graded from 0
to 3þ based on strength of the staining. It was observed that
although nonatypical nevi rarely demonstrated loss of PTEN,
>10% of atypical nevi and every stage of melanoma demonstrated loss of PTEN expression (either 0 or þ1). Significantly,

WM793, 1205Lu) cells were treated with PLX4720 (24 hours: 0.03–3 mmol/L) and probed for phospho-PDK1 (pPDK1), total PDK1, phospho-AKT (pAKT),

before treatment with either vehicle or PLX4720 (3 mmol/L). C, siRNA knockdown of BRAF increases pAKT in melanoma cell lines that are PTEN. WM164
(PTENþ) and WM793 (PTEN) cells were incubated with lipofectamine alone (L), nontargeting siRNA (NT), or BRAF-specific siRNA (BRAF). Protein

primary melanoma, lymph node metastases, and distant
metastases melanoma demonstrated loss of PTEN in 12.5%,
27%, and 14% of cases each (Fig. 2A and C). Staining of the same
TMA for pAKT demonstrated an increase in AKT activation as
the tumors progressed from primary melanoma to distant
metastasis (Fig. 2B). The level of pAKT positivity only partially
correlated with PTEN expression status (Fig. 2C).
PLX4720 and BRAF siRNA leads to AKT signaling in
BRAF V600E-mutated/PTEN melanoma cell lines
Treatment of the PTENþ/ cell line panels with PLX4720
increased pPDK1 and pAKT signaling only in the melanoma cell
lines lacking PTEN expression (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PLX4720
inhibited BRAF activity in both PTEN and PTENþ cell lines
with a similar potency (Supplementary Fig. S4) and prevented
BrdU uptake in both PTENþ and PTEN cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5). Addition of PLX4720 also led to the inhibition
of mTOR activity in the PTENþ cell lines only (Fig. 3A) and was
associated with stimulation of LKB1 and AMPK signaling
(Supplementary Fig. S6). The requirement for PTEN in the
increased AKT signaling was confirmed by studies showing

2754

Cancer Res; 71(7) April 1, 2011

that PLX4720 stimulated pAKT in WM35 cells (PTENþ) when
PTEN was knocked down by siRNA (Fig. 3B). The effects of
PLX4720 upon pAKT signaling were BRAF specific, with BRAF
siRNA knockdown found to increase pAKT in PTEN cells only
(Fig. 3C). Mechanistically, PLX4720 increased IGF-I signaling in
the PTEN cells, with the IGFR1 inhibitor NVP-ADW-742 (21)
being found to abrogate the PLX4720-mediated increase in
pAKT signaling (Supplementary Fig. S7).
PLX4720 treatment differentially regulates BIM in
PTENþ and PTEN cells
We next used LC-MRM to quantify the PLX4720-induced
changes in the expression of 17 members of the Bcl-2 protein
family (Fig. 4A shows results for 9 proteins). The only proapoptotic protein to demonstrate significant differences
between the PTEN and PTENþ cell lines was BIM
(Fig. 4A; 14- and 4-fold increases in the PTENþ and PTEN
cell lines, respectively). Western blots and immunofluorescence staining confirmed the LC-MRM data and showed a
greater degree of PLX4720-induced (3 and 10 mmol/L) BIM
expression in the PTENþ cell lines compared to PTEN cell

observed that PLX4720 also increased the inactivation of BAD
(as shown by increased phospho-BAD) in the PTEN cells
(Fig. 4D) and that overexpression of BAD in the PTEN cells
enhanced PLX4720-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 4D). PLX4720
treatment also increased total BAD expression in both the
PTENþ and PTEN cell lines. Little PLX4720-induced
changes in Mcl-1 expression were observed in the PTENþ
and PTEN cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S9).

We next explored the link between PTEN expression status
and PLX4720-mediated induction of BIM. siRNA knockdown
of PTEN using 2 siRNA sequences led to the inhibition of
PLX4720-induced BIM expression in PTENþ cells (Fig. 5A).

We next determined whether reintroduction of wild-type
PTEN (PTEN-wt) or lipid phosphatase mutated PTEN
(PTEN-G129E) into a PTEN cell line enhanced BIM expression when BRAF was inhibited. In these studies, we used an
isogenic pair of WM793 melanoma cell lines that expressed
either doxycycline inducible PTEN-wt or PTEN-G129E
mutant. Control studies showed that doxycyline (100 ng/
mL, 48 hours) increased expression of PTEN in both cell lines
(Fig. 5B). The impaired lipid phosphatase function of the
G129E mutant was confirmed by the fact that only the
induction of PTEN-wt suppressed pAKT activation
(Fig. 5B). The role of PTEN in the PLX4720-mediated induction
of BIM was confirmed by the enhanced expression of BIM seen
when PTEN-wt was induced compared to when PTEN-G129E
was induced (Fig. 5B) and was paralleled by a significant
increase in PLX4720-mediated apoptosis (P < 0.05; not

expression of PTEN through mechanisms that are not currently clear. The effects of PI3K/AKT signaling upon the

in the PLX4720-induced apoptotic response, we showed that

cell lines with a PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941, 3 mmol/L or

BRAF inhibition increased the level of BIM expression in both
Western blot and immunofluorescence studies (Fig. 6A). Both
the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways are known to regulate
BIM RNA expression levels through the transcription factor
FOXO3a (22–25). In agreement with this, PLX4720 treatment

increased the nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a in the PTENþ
but not PTEN melanoma cells (Fig. 6B; not shown). Consistent with a role for increased AKT signaling suppressing
BIM expression in PTEN cells, dual BRAF and PI3K inhibition increased nuclear FOXO3a localization in the PTEN cell
lines (Fig. 6B) and enhanced the level of BIM mRNA (Fig. 6B).
siRNA knockdown of FOXO3a was further found to block
PLX4720-mediated upregulation of BIM in PTENþ cells (Supplementary Fig. S11). The observation that PLX4720 treatment
led to increased PI3K/AKT signaling in PTEN melanoma cell
lines suggested that dual BRAF/PI3K inhibition could be one
strategy to overcome intrinsic resistance. In agreement with
this, the combination of PLX4720 with the PI3K inhibitor
GDC-0941 significantly enhanced the levels of apoptosis
observed in PTEN melanoma cell lines compared to either
the BRAF or PI3K inhibitor alone (Fig. 6C). Similar results were
also observed in a 3D spheroid assay, where combined
PLX4720 (3 mmol/L) and LY294002 (10 mmol/L) treatment
prevented the recovery of cell growth observed when melanoma spheroids were treated with either drug alone (Fig. 6D).
The proposed mechanism for BIM regulation following BRAF
inhibition in PTENþ and PTEN melanoma cell lines is
shown in Supplementary Figure S12.

Discussion
This study has focused upon the mechanisms underlying
the intrinsic resistance observed in melanoma patients
recently treated in the phase-I trial of PLX4032 (4). Melanomas are known to have constitutive activity in many
signaling pathways whose outputs converge to regulate cell
cycle entry and survival. Of these, melanoma initiation and
progression is known to be dependent upon both the Ras/
Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways (12, 26–28). The
mechanisms underlying this signaling activity differ according to the initiating oncogenic event. Thus, melanomas with
activating NRAS mutations rarely harbor concurrent alterations in either BRAF or PTEN/AKT as Ras stimulates both
the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways (29, 30). In
contrast, melanomas with BRAF mutations require other
mechanisms to activate their PI3K/AKT signaling and frequently show inactivation/deletion of PTEN or increased
expression of AKT3 (31–34).
We began by investigating PTEN expression across a large
sample of melanocytic lesions and found that PTEN was lost
in 10% to 27% of melanomas. Although PTEN loss overlapped
with the level of pAKT staining it was not always well
correlated, agreeing with previous observations that other
mechanisms may underlie the increased AKT activation associated with melanoma progression (35). Our results agree with
other published studies on smaller numbers of melanoma
samples (n ¼ 16–39), and confirm that reduced PTEN expression is a significant oncogenic event for a restricted subgroup
of melanomas (31, 32, 36). Although PTEN was retained in
nonatypical nevi, a significant number (23%) of atypical nevi
lacked expression, suggesting this to be an early event in
melanoma development. This idea is supported by recent
mouse modeling studies showing that the conditional expres-

2758

sion of the BRAF V600E mutation leads to melanoma development only when PTEN is suppressed (28).
Although lack of PTEN expression did not predict for
sensitivity of BRAF V600E-mutated melanoma cell lines to
the growth inhibitory effects of PLX4720, there were significant differences in PLX4720-mediated apoptosis between
PTENþ and PTEN melanoma cell lines. Initially, we
hypothesized that PTEN melanoma cell lines would show
higher levels of AKT activity and that this would mediate
resistance to PLX4720. Instead, we observed that drug treatment increased AKT signaling in the PTEN cell lines. The
effects upon AKT signaling were PTEN dependent, and could
be recapitulated in PTENþ melanoma cell lines when PTEN
was knocked down using siRNA. The increase in AKT signaling
observed in the PTEN cell line panel was associated with
PDK1 phosphorylation and increased expression of IGF-I.
These effects were reversed following pretreatment with
the IGF1R inhibitor NVD-ADW-742 (21), suggesting a link
between BRAF inhibition and enhanced IGF1R-mediated PI3K
signaling. Similar findings, linking BRAF/MEK inhibition to
increased IGF signaling, have been recently reported by 2
other groups (37, 38).
AKT plays a critical role in cancer development through its
ability to regulate cell survival through the direct phosphorylation of BAD, the stimulation of ribosomal S6 kinase signaling, the inhibition of FOXO signaling, and the inhibition of
glycogen synthase 3-kinase (35). To determine the mechanism
of PLX4720-induced apoptosis induction in the PTENþ melanoma cell lines, LC-MRM analysis was used to quantify the
relative expression of members of the Bcl-2 protein family (20).
For the majority of proteins examined, PLX4720 treatment
was associated with very similar dynamics in both the PTENþ
and PTEN cell lines. These findings agree with previous
studies and show that BRAF inhibition leads to an increase in
the expression in the proapoptotic protein BIM (18, 39, 40). In
contrast to these studies, which did not distinguish between
PTENþ and PTEN cell lines, the LC-MRM analysis allowed
us to identify significant PTEN-dependent differences in the
level of PLX4720-induced BIM expression. BIM is a proapoptotic BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 protein family that exists
in 3 major splice forms; extra long (BIM-EL), long (BIM-L) and
short (BIM-S; refs. 41 and 42). It exerts its cytotoxic activity by
binding to and antagonizing the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2,
Bcl-w, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 (41, 42). Expression of BIM is
regulated both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally
by a number of signaling pathways, including BRAF/MEK/
ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, and PI3K/AKT (39, 41, 43, 44). In
melanoma, the BRAF V600E mutation regulates BIM expression through the MEK/ERK pathway-mediated phosphorylation of the extra-long form of BIM (BIM-EL) at Serine 69,
leading to its subsequent degradation by the proteasome (39,
45). Our study is the first to demonstrate that the level of BIM
expression following BRAF inhibition is also determined by
PTEN status and that the differing levels of BIM induction can
determine the extent of apoptosis induction when BRAF is
inhibited. Apoptosis control in melanoma cells is complex and
increased AKT signaling is likely to regulate survival at multiple levels. One of the best known prosurvival substrates of

Intrinsic BRAF Inhibitor Resistance

AKT is the cell death inducing molecule BAD. AKT inactivates
BAD via phosphorylation at Ser99, which prevents its binding
to Bax and relieves the antagonism of Bax on Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL
(18). A role for Bad inactivation in the escape of PTEN cells
from PLX4720-induced apoptosis was suggested by the preferential inactivation of BAD when BRAF was inhibited and
the fact that overexpression of BAD sensitized the same cell
line to PLX4720-induced apoptosis. Another candidate proapoptotic factor up-regulated in melanoma cells following
BRAF/MEK/ERK inhibition is BMF (Bcl-2 modifying factor;
refs. 40 and 46). BMF, which is also regulated through the
PI3K/AKT pathway, mediates its apoptotic effects through
binding to Mcl-1. Although it is possible that BMF may also be
differentially regulated in PTENþ/ cells, we, like other
groups, were unable to confirm the selectivity of commercially
available BMF antibodies (40, 47).
In addition to regulating PIP3 levels in the cytoplasm
through its lipid phosphatase function, PTEN also localizes
to the nucleus where it exerts its tumor suppressor function
through lipid phosphatase-independent effects upon the
regulation of chromosomal integrity, p53 acetylation and
the expression of cyclin D1 (48). As the lipid phosphatasedependent and -independent functions of PTEN are likely to
be very different, we re-expressed either wild-type PTEN or a
PTEN mutant with impaired lipid phosphatase function
(G129E) in melanoma cells that were PTEN (49). These
studies confirmed the requirement for the lipid phosphatase
function of PTEN in the suppression of BIM expression, with
PLX4720 treatment inducing only a weak upregulation of
BIM protein when PTEN G129E was expressed. The importance of the lipid phosphatase function in the suppression
of BIM expression was supported by experiments showing
that combined BRAF/PI3K inhibition and siRNA knockdown
of AKT3 both enhanced the level of BIM expression and
increased the level of apoptosis in the PTEN cells. In
other systems, AKT downregulates BIM expression by phosphorylating and inactivating the transcription factor

FOXO3a (22, 24). In agreement with these reports, we confirmed that PLX4720 treatment led to increased nuclear
accumulation of FOXO3a in the PTENþ cells only and
demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of FOXO3a abrogated
the increase in BIM expression.
In summary, we have identified an important role for PTEN
loss in the intrinsic resistance of BRAF V600E mutated melanoma cells to the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. These studies
further suggest that increased BIM expression may be a useful
biomarker in predicting clinical response to BRAF inhibition
and demonstrates that LC-MRM is a useful method for
monitoring BIM expression that could be translated to patient
assessment. This work also provides a rationale for dual
BRAF/PI3K inhibitor treatment in the management of melanomas that are BRAFV600E/PTEN.
