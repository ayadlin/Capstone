BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may prevent the development of cancer by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are involved in carcinogenesis. Therefore, the authors of this report examined the association between
NSAID use and the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and malignant melanoma (MM). METHODS:
From 1991 through 2009, all incident cases of SCC (n ¼ 1974), BCC (n ¼ 13,316), and MM (n ¼ 3242) in northern Denmark were identified. Approximately 10 population controls (n ¼ 178,655) were matched to each case by age, gender, and county of residence. The
use of aspirin, other nonselective NSAIDs, or selective COX-2 inhibitors was ascertained through a prescription database. Conditional
logistic regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders were used to compute odds ratios as estimates of incidence rate
ratios (IRRs). RESULTS: For NSAIDs overall, ever use (>2 prescriptions) compared with nonuse (2 prescriptions) was associated
with a decreased risk of SCC (IRR, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.94) and MM (IRR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.95), especially
for long-term use (7 years) and high-intensity use (>25% prescription coverage during the total duration of use). NSAID use was
not associated with a reduced risk of BCC overall (IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.01), but the risk of BCC at sites other than the head
and neck was reduced in association with long-term use (IRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.95) and high-intensity use (IRR, 0.79; 95% CI,
0.69-0.91). All estimates of reduced risk were driven primarily by the use of nonselective NSAIDs and older COX-2 inhibitors (diclofenac, etodolac, and meloxicam). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that NSAID use may decrease the risk of SCC and MM.

INTRODUCTION
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have potential cancer-preventive effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase
(COX) enzymes, which are involved in detrimental processes, such as inhibition of apoptosis, immunosuppression, and
stimulation of angiogenesis and invasiveness.1,2 Moreover, COX-independent pathways that involve lipoxygenases and
extracellular signal-regulated kinases also may be involved.2 The cancer-preventive properties of NSAIDs have been
observed particularly for colorectal cancer among users of COX-2 inhibitors or aspirin but also may extend to other
cancers.1,2
Previous studies largely support a protective role of NSAIDs in development of keratinocyte carcinomas, ie, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), as well as malignant melanoma (MM).3-13 Thus, the results
from 1 randomized controlled study indicated a lower risk of keratinocyte carcinomas associated with use of the COX-2
inhibitor celecoxib.8 However, the previous studies are controversial and are difficult to compare because of differences in
outcome measures (eg, inclusion or exclusion of in situ cancers), study design, study populations (eg, high-risk populations vs general populations), and type and measure of NSAID use.3-13 Therefore, we conducted a population-based,
case-control study using validated registry data to examine whether orally administered aspirin, other nonselective
NSAIDs, or COX-2 inhibitors are associated with reduced incidence of SCC, BCC or MM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Setting and Design

We conducted this study in northern Denmark, which
has a population of approximately 1.8 million (30% of
the Danish population).14 To ensure that we had at least 2
years of complete prescription history for all study participants, the study period commenced 2 years after establishment of the prescription databases in northern Denmark
(all were established between 1989 and 1998) and continued until December 31, 2008. We included only individuals who had resided in the study area for at least 2 years.
In Denmark, a government-funded health care plan
guarantees universal tax-supported health care for all residents; and prescribed medication, including NSAIDs, is
subsidized to various degrees.14,15 The unique central personal registration (CPR) number assigned to all Danish
residents allows linkage of medical registries.16
Skin Cancer Cases

Since 1943, the Danish Cancer Registry (DCR) has
recorded all malignancies together with details on morphology and histology.17 We used the DCR to identify all
incident cases of SCC, BCC, and MM diagnosed during
the study period in individuals aged 20 years. Patients
who had more than 1 type of skin cancer were included in
the analysis of each type. To evaluate the effects of
NSAIDs on skin cancer by the approximate level of sun
exposure, we extracted information on the anatomic site
of skin cancer (ie, head and neck vs other sites). We
excluded individuals who had human immunodeficiency
virus infection, a previous cancer diagnosis, or a history of
solid organ transplantation, because these disorders
increase skin cancer risk.18,19 The date of diagnosis was
considered the index date for cases.
Population Controls

Since 1968, the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS)
has recorded all changes in vital status, such as death and
migration, with daily updates.16 We used the CRS to
match up to 10 population controls to each case by birth
year, sex, and county of residence. We sampled controls
using risk-set sampling; ie, only individuals who were alive
and who had no history of skin cancer registered in the
DCR on the index date of the case were eligible for selection.20 The same inclusion/exclusion criteria that were
used to select cases were applied to controls. Controls
were assigned an index date identical to that of their corresponding case.
Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug Use

We used the Aarhus University database14 to identify all
NSAID prescriptions that were redeemed by study particCancer

ipants before their index date. Each time a prescription is
redeemed at a pharmacy, a record of the patient’s CPR
number, the date, and the type and quantity of drug prescribed (according to the World Health Organization’s
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System) is
transmitted to the database.14
We identified prescriptions for low-dose aspirin (75
mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg) and high-dose aspirin (500 mg),
other nonselective NSAIDs (phenylbutazon, indomethacin, sulindac, aceclofenac, piroxicam, tenoxicam, lornoxicam, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen,
flurbiprofen, dexibuprofen, tiaprofenic acid, tolfenamic
acid, and nabumeton), older selective COX-2 inhibitors
(diclofenac, etodolac, and meloxicam), and newer selective COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib, rofecoxib, and etoricoxib).21 We examined older and newer COX-2
inhibitors separately as well as together because of overlapping COX-2 selectivity.2,21
We categorized exposure according to the number
of prescriptions filled by each individual. We excluded
prescriptions redeemed within the year before the index
date to reduce both surveillance bias1 and the potential
effect of subclinical disease on medication use. ‘‘Ever
users’’ redeemed >2 prescriptions during the entire study
period and were classified further as either recent users
(>2 prescriptions within 1-2 years before the index date)
or former users (>2 prescriptions in total, but not within
1-2 years before the index date). We classified duration of
use as short-term (<7 years) or long-term (7 years)
based on the number of days between the first and the last
prescriptions plus the average prescription length
(assumed to be 30 days).22 We defined intensity of use as
low (<25%) or high (25%) according to the number of
days of prescription coverage (product of the number of
prescriptions and length of prescription) divided by duration of use in days. We defined individuals who had 2
NSAID prescriptions as nonusers (reference group).
Finally, for a comparison analysis, we examined the association between prescribed acetaminophen and the risk of
skin cancer.1
Patient Characteristics

From the Danish National Registry of Patients,23 we
retrieved patients’ medical history between 1977 and the
index date and computed their comorbidity burden using
the validated Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score.24
We also identified patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
migraines, or cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease), using these diseases and the CCI as proxy measures

for chronic use of over-the-counter, low-dose ibuprofen
and aspirin. Furthermore, we identified a history of any
autoimmune disease, because these diseases are associated
with increased NSAID intake25 and may affect skin cancer
risk.26-28
Comedication Use

Various drugs other than NSAIDs also may affect skin
cancer risk.18,29-31 Therefore, we used the prescription
database to obtain information on use of the following
comedications before the index date: glucocorticoids,
cytostatic and immunosuppressive drugs, treatments for
skin cancer precursor lesions, topical NSAIDs, and drugs
with documented adverse effects of photosensitivity,
phototoxicity, and/or pigmentation according to Litt’s
Drug Eruption Reference Manual.25,32 We also identified
psoralen and ultraviolet A (UVA) treatment through
treatment codes in the Danish National Registry of
Patients.

or anatomic site. In the comparison analysis of acetaminophen, we considered only nonusers of NSAIDs and
defined the reference group as individuals who had 2
acetaminophen prescriptions. We also estimated the IRR
in ever users compared with nonusers of both NSAIDs
and acetaminophen.
To examine the robustness of our findings, we performed 3 sensitivity analyses. First, we examined the isolated effect of any NSAIDs, low-dose aspirin, nonselective
NSAIDs, and COX-2 inhibitors by examining the associations among patients who did not use other NSAIDs
and/or acetaminophen. Second, to reduce potential surveillance bias,1 we repeated the analyses after excluding
prescriptions that were redeemed within 2 years and then
within 3 years before the index date, altering the exposure
definitions accordingly. Third, we reanalyzed the effects
of duration and intensity of use using an average prescription length of 60 days.

Statistical Analysis

RESULTS

We computed the frequency and proportion of cases and
controls in categories of each study variable. We used conditional logistic regression to compute unadjusted odds
ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), associating
NSAID use with SCC, BCC, and MM occurrence. Given
the risk-set sampling design, the odds ratios provide an
unbiased estimate of incidence rate ratios (IRRs).20
Next, we adjusted for 1 covariate at a time to quantify the confounding effect of each before fitting a multivariate, conditional logistic regression model with
adjustment for CCI score and use of systemic glucocorticoids, cytostatic or immunosuppressive medications, and
drugs with pigmenting adverse effects. We estimated
adjusted IRRs with 95% CIs for skin cancer among ever
users, recent users, and former users of NSAIDs. This
approach was used for any NSAIDs; low-dose and highdose aspirin; nonselective NSAIDs; older, newer, and all
COX-2 inhibitors; and the most frequently used agents.
In the analyses of NSAID subtypes, we ignored use of
NSAIDs different from the subtype under consideration;
for example, use of aspirin was not taken into account
when examining nonselective NSAIDs. In analyses examining intensity and duration of use, we considered all
NSAIDs together and reduced bias because of left censoring by focusing only on individuals with a minimum of
10 years of prescription history. To explore the presence
of effect measure modification, we performed unconditional logistic regression with additional adjustment for
the matching factors and stratified the results by age, sex,

Descriptive Data

4770

We identified a total of 1974 patients with SCC, 13,316
patients with BCC, and 3242 patients with MM. The median age at diagnosis was 77 years, 67 years, and 57 years
among patients with SCC, BCC, and MM, respectively
(Table 1). Men accounted for a greater proportion of
patients with SCC (63%) versus patients with BCC
(50%) and MM (45%). SCC tumors were located more
frequently on the head and neck (56%) compared with
BCC tumors (50%) and MM tumors (12%).
Among controls, 38% (67,338 patients) were ever
users of NSAIDs. Only 6% had redeemed 1 or more prescriptions for newer COX-inhibitors, and, among these,
only 37% had more than 6 months’ duration of use; this
proportion decreased exponentially to 28%, 14%, and
6% after 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively.
Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and Skin
Cancer

Ever use of NSAIDs, compared with nonuse, was associated with slightly reduced risks of SCC (adjusted IRR,
0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.94) and MM (IRR, 0.87; 95% CI,
0.80-0.95) but not BCC (IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.01)
(Table 2). We observed no variation in the magnitude of
associations according to timing of use, ie, recent use or
former use. However, the magnitude of associations
depended on the duration and intensity of use (Table 3).
Decreased IRRs for SCC were observed in all subgroups
of duration and intensity of use, especially among highCancer

site. We observed no apparent modification of the effect
estimates by age or sex.
Acetaminophen and Skin Cancer

Unexpectedly, we observed an inverse association between
acetaminophen use and the risk of BCC at sites other than
the head and neck (IRR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.83). This
decreased risk was observed in high-intensity and/or longterm users. Overall, ever use of acetaminophen was not
associated with the risk of MM (IRR, 0.98; 95% CI,
0.74-1.31), but the analyses of duration and intensity of
use revealed a 20% to 30% risk reduction in high-intensity and/or long-term users. No association was observed
between acetaminophen use and the risk of SCC (IRR,
0.96; 95% CI, 0.74-1.23). IRRs for ever use of both
NSAIDs and acetaminophen were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.680.96) for SCC, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96) for BCC, and
0.77 (95% CI, 0.64-0.93) for MM.
Sensitivity Analyses

Taking concurrent use of other NSAIDs into account
weakened the inverse association between low-dose aspirin, newer COX-2 inhibitors, and the risk of SCC but
strengthened the inverse association with older COX-2
inhibitors. The effect estimates remained similar for BCC
and MM, except for an attenuation of the association
between nonselective NSAIDs and the risk of MM. The
results were not affected meaningfully by changing the average prescription length to 60 days or by excluding
NSAIDs prescribed within 2 years or 3 years before the
index date.
DISCUSSION
We observed that use of NSAIDs overall, including aspirin, nonselective nonaspirin NSAIDs, and COX-2 inhibitors, was associated with a decreased risk of skin cancer,
particularly SCC and MM. The effect increased with
greater duration and intensity of use, which may reflect a
cumulative biologic effect (ie, a dose-response effect)
exerted in the initiation of carcinogenesis. In line with the
approved treatment of actinic keratosis with topical diclofenac,25 we also observed that older COX-2 inhibitors
(including diclofenac) were associated with a greater isolated reduction in the risk of SCC versus BCC and MM.
The various associations for skin cancer subtypes
and anatomic sites may be explained by dissimilarities in
the expression of COX enzymes. For example, laboratory
studies consistently have reported elevated COX-2 levels
in SCC and its precursor lesions (eg, actinic keratosis and
Bowen disease), whereas results have been conflicting for
BCC and MM.2,33,34 Another explanation may be that
4774

the phototoxic adverse effects of some NSAIDs preclude
their protective effects at sun-exposed sites, especially in
MM and BCC, because they are associated more strongly
with sunburns (ie, intermittent, intense sun exposure)
than SCC.18,19 Also, the harmful effect of sun exposure
itself at such sites may be so strong that the protective
effects of NSAIDs are reduced.
A recent trial investigated the risk of BCC, SCC,
and actinic keratosis after 11 months of follow-up in 240
high-risk patients who were randomized to receive either a
placebo or 200 mg celecoxib administered orally twice
daily for 9 months.8 The trial indicated that there was a
protective effect of celecoxib on both SCC (relative risk
[RR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.93) and BCC (RR, 0.40;
95% CI, 0.18-0.93),8 similar to the results from 2 observational studies in high-risk populations.6,12 Our results
do not support an association between newer COX-2
inhibitors and skin cancer or NSAIDs overall and BCC.
However, our findings are in accordance with studies conducted in the general population.3,4,13,35 Thus, the effects
of NSAIDs may depend on the baseline risk of skin cancer. In addition, newer COX-2 inhibitors are rarely used
continuously for a longer time; were commercially available for only part of the study period; and in, some instances (rofecoxib), were withdrawn from the market.25
Therefore, duration of use in our study population may
not have been sufficient to demonstrate a protective effect
of these agents.
Five previous studies have examined the association
between aspirin and other nonaspirin NSAIDs and the
risk of MM.5,7,9-11 Only 1 of those studies failed to demonstrate an inverse association.5 Like us, Curiel-Lewandrowski et al7 observed that the inverse association was
cumulative and that the association remained even after
taking into account concurrent use of other NSAIDs. On
average, previous studies reported a higher prevalence of
NSAID use.3-13 This discrepancy is likely attributable to
differences in defining ‘‘ever users,’’ age and sex distributions, and the source of exposure data (self-reported vs
prescription records).
The major limitation of the current study is that
cases were ascertained through the DCR, in which only an
estimated 60% of SCC and BCC cases are
recorded.28,29,36 This incompleteness hypothetically may
bias our results in 2 ways. On 1 hand, if NSAID users
have higher comorbidity than nonusers, then some clinicians may deem the detection of a keratinocyte carcinoma
relatively trivial and not as important to register as other
comorbidities, thereby producing a false inverse association between NSAIDs and SCC or BCC risk. Conversely,
Cancer

NSAID Use and Skin Cancer/Johannesdottir et al

NSAID users may be in more frequent contact with the
health care system and, thus, may have a greater chance of
skin cancer detection—a scenario that would cause us to
underestimate the actual inverse association with NSAID
use.1 In any case, the completeness of data in the DCR is
high for other cancers, including MM17; therefore, the
inverse association with MM strengthens the validity of
our results.
Our study relied on dispensed prescriptions, which
may not be equivalent to actual drug use. However, the
fact that patients partially paid for and repeatedly
redeemed prescriptions suggests adherence with the medications and increases our confidence that we accurately
classified chronic, long-term use of NSAIDs—the exposure of greatest interest in our study. Over-the-counter use
of aspirin and low-dose ibuprofen also may have affected
our results. However, regular users typically are registered
in the prescription database, because the cost is automatically partly refunded when a physician prescribes the
drug.15 We also lacked data on length of prescriptions and,
thus, could not classify daily or weekly doses of each drug.
Finally, we may have misclassified some former users as
nonusers because of left censoring through the prescription
database. Nonetheless, at the most, these limitations in exposure classification would have led us to underestimate a
protective effect of NSAIDs on skin cancer.
We had no information on lifestyle factors, skin
phenotype, or UV radiation exposure. However, matching on county of residence and the limited geographic variation in northern Denmark minimizes geographic
differences in ambient UV radiation exposure.37 To
explain our results, unmeasured confounders would have
to be associated with both long-term NSAID use and
decreased risk of skin cancer. In this context, a Danish
study previously demonstrated that continuous analgesic
use is more frequent in individuals with poor self-reported
health, smoking, and low levels of education and physical
activity,38 suggesting that a healthy user effect is unlikely.
The comparison analysis of acetaminophen was used as an
indicator of a potential healthy user effect. Unexpectedly,
we observed an inverse association between acetaminophen and BCC and MM risk, possibly suggesting confounding by unmeasured factors. Conversely, an actual
protective effect of acetaminophen is plausible, eg,
through COX-3 inhibition or activation by tyrosinase to
cytotoxic metabolites in melanocytes.39,40 The clinical
data on this association, however, are limited and conflicting.4,13,35,41 When interpreting these discrepancies, our
lack of information on over-the-counter acetaminophen
should be taken into account.

Given the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of
these agents may have important public health implications. We observed that NSAIDs overall, including aspirin, other nonselective NSAIDs, and older COX-2
inhibitors, were associated with a decreased risk of skin
cancer, particularly SCC and MM. The risk reduction
was greatest among long-term and high-intensity users,
suggesting a cumulative and dose-dependent, protective
effect.
