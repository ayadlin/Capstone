Abstract
Recent case-controlled clinical studies show that bronchioalveolar carcinomas (BAC) are correlated with
smoking. Nicotine, the addictive component of cigarettes, accelerates cell proliferation through nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). In this study, we show that human BACs produce acetylcholine (ACh) and
contain several cholinergic factors including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT),
choline transporter 1 (CHT1, SLC5A7), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT, SLC18A3), and nACh
receptors (AChRs, CHRNAs). Nicotine increased the production of ACh in human BACs, and ACh acts as a
growth factor for these cells. Nicotine-induced ACh production was mediated by a7-, a3b2-, and b3-nAChRs,
ChAT and VAChT pathways. We observed that nicotine upregulated ChAT and VAChT. Therefore, we conjectured
that VAChT antagonists, such as vesamicol, may suppress the growth of human BACs. Vesamicol induced potent
apoptosis of human BACs in cell culture and nude mice models. Vesamicol did not have any effect on EGF or
insulin-like growth factor-II–induced growth of human BACs. siRNA-mediated attenuation of VAChT reversed
the apoptotic activity of vesamicol. We also observed that vesamicol inhibited Akt phosphorylation during cell
death and that overexpression of constitutively active Akt reversed the apoptotic activity of vesamicol. Taken
together, our results suggested that disruption of nicotine-induced cholinergic signaling by agents such as
vesamicol may have applications in BAC therapy. Cancer Res; 73(4); 1328–39. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Bronchioalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a subtype of lung
adenocarcinoma arising from type II pneumonocytes in the
lung. The World Health Organization revised its classiﬁcation
of BACs in 2004 to include lung adenocarcinomas, which grow
in a lepidic fashion along the alveolar septa without invasion
into the stroma, pleura, blood vessels, or lymphatics (1–3). The
incidence of pure BACs is about 4%; however, mixed subtypes,
including BACs with stromal invasion and pulmonary adenocarcinoma with BAC-like morphologic features, account for
almost 20% of all non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC; ref. 4).
Cigarette smoking is the leading risk factor for the develop-

ment of lung cancer. It is estimated that smoking is associated
with 80% to 90% of lung cancer cases throughout the world (5).
Smoking has a stronger association with small cell lung cancer
(SCLC) than with adenocarcinoma (6). BAC is a relatively rare
type of adenocarcinoma; therefore, only a few epidemiologic
studies have investigated the relationship between BAC and
smoking (7–9).
Traditionally, the role of tobacco smoking in the etiology of
human BAC originates from a series of early studies involving
human patients with lung cancer, most of which were nonsmokers (1). These non-smoking patients with lung cancer had
higher incidence of BAC than other types of lung cancer. The
resulting impression was that smoking is unimportant in the
etiology of human BACs (1). However, these reports did not
contain any cohort or case–control studies that formally
determined the relationship of human BACs to cigarette
smoking.
Epidemiologic data have shown an association between
human BACs and smoking (7, 8, 10). The risk of developing
BACs is greater for people who started smoking at a younger
age, smoked for a longer time, or smoked more cigarettes per
day. Conversely, the risk decreases in proportion to the duration of smoking cessation. Smoking habits have been correlated to both the mucinous and non-mucinous form of human
BACs (11). Rolen and colleagues conducted a case–control
study and compared smoking status of 198 patients with BACs
with an equal number of controls. They observed that the risk
of BACs is strongly related to the smoking history of patients.

VAChT Inhibition and Bronchioalveolar Carcinoma

They also found that both current and former smokers were at
risk of developing BACs (9). Recently, Boffetta and colleagues
analyzed 7 case-controlled studies in the United States comprising 799 cases of BACs and 15,859 controls. They found that
ever smokers are at a 2-fold greater risk of developing BACs
than never smokers. They also observed a positive correlation
between the duration and amount of smoking and the development of lung BACs (8).
Although cigarette smoke is composed of a mixture of
many compounds, nicotine is the addictive component of
cigarette smoke (12). Several convergent studies have shown
that nicotine promotes the progression of human BACs and
confers resistance against chemotherapy (12, 13). All of these
observations suggest that nicotine-induced mitogenic and
prosurvival pathways contribute to the pathophysiology of
BACs.
The proliferative activity of nicotine is mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs; ref. 12). The endogenous ligand for nAChRs is acetylcholine (ACh; ref. 14).
Recent studies have shown that nAChRs are present in
non-neuronal tissues, including lung cancer cells, lung epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes (12). SCLCs
and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SCC-L) express all
components of the ACh autocrine loop, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT),
vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), choline transporter1 (CHT1), nAChRs, and muscarinic acetylcholine
receptors. SCLCs and SCC-L cells secrete ACh, which promotes their proliferation (14–17). Song and colleagues found
that the muscarinic receptor antagonist darifenacin displayed antitumor activity in human SCC-L in both cell
culture and nude mice models (15, 18). Such observations
suggest that the cholinergic network may be a viable molecular target in the therapy of human lung cancer.
The present manuscript investigates whether the cholinergic loop exists in human BACs. We show that human BAC cell
lines produce ACh and express cholinergic proteins. We also
show for the ﬁrst time that nicotine can amplify the components of the cholinergic loop in human BACs. Nicotine
increased the production of ACh in human BAC cell lines in
a time- and dose-dependent manner. ACh acted as a growth
factor for human BAC cells. Nicotine upregulated VAChT and
ChAT expression in human BAC cells. We conjectured that
nicotine-induced increase of VAChT levels may provide a
viable molecular target in human BACs. The VAChT antagonist
vesamicol induced robust apoptosis of human BAC cells in
both cell culture and in vivo models. Vesamicol did not affect
EGF or insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II–induced growth
pathways in human BACs. This ﬁnding suggests that the
pro-apoptotic activity of vesamicol is speciﬁc to the acetylcholine signaling pathway in human BACs. The pro-apoptotic
activity of vesamicol was mediated via suppression of Akt
activation. The data presented in this article characterize the
cholinergic system in human BACs and offer novel avenues for
BAC therapy. The results of our experiments are relevant to
patients with BACs who are exposed to secondhand smoke or
use nicotine-based cessation devices (e.g., patches and gums)
to quit smoking.

Materials and Methods
Ethical use and care of laboratory animals
Nude mice (Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.)
were acclimatized for 1 week. They were housed in autoclaved
cages with ad libitum access to food and water in HEPA-ﬁltered
racks and closely monitored by animal facility staff. All procedures involving nude mice were conducted according to
the Animal Care and Use Guidelines in a facility accredited
by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International and were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Joan
C. Edwards School of Medicine, Marshall University (Huntington, WV; Protocol # 418).
Authentication of cell lines
The human BAC cell lines, A549, NCI-H358, and NCI-H650
(hereinafter referred to as A549, H358, and H650), and the
human SCC-L cell line H520 were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The A549, H358, and H520
cells were authenticated by the ATCC Cell Authentication
Service in October 2012. They used short tandem repeat (STR)
proﬁling for authentication of these cells, and the results are
summarized in Supplementary Fig. S1. The human BAC cell
line H650 was passaged for less than 6 months and therefore
did not require authentication. This cell line was obtained from
ATCC, which used STR proﬁling for its characterization.
Primary human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC)
were obtained from ScienCell. These cells were characterized
by ScienCell using immunostaining for speciﬁc markers. A
certiﬁcate of analysis was provided.
Cell culture
A549 and H358 were cultured in RPMI-1640, supplemented
with 2.0 mmol/L glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, 50.0 mg/mL
streptomycin, 1.0 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1
insulin, transferrin, sodium selenite (ITS) supplement (Invitrogen Corp), 50 nmol/L hydrocortisone, and 1.0 mg/mL human
EGF (15, 16). This medium will be referred to hereafter as
serum-free RPMI (SF-RPMI). For a few experiments, the cells
were rendered quiescent by incubating them in SF-RPMI containing 1/4 ITS supplement, 12.5 nmol/L hydrocortisone and
0.25 mg/mL EGF. This media, reduced serum-free RPMI, will
be referred to hereafter as SF-RPMI-R. H650 was grown in a
1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagles' Media (DMEM)
and Ham/F-12K, supplemented with 2.0 mmol/L L-glutamine,
100 units/mL penicillin, 50.0 mg/mL streptomycin, 0.02 mg/mL
bovine insulin, 1 ITS, 50 nmol/L hydrocortisone, 100 mmol/L
ethanolamine, 100 mmol/L O-phosphorylethanolamine, 100
mmol/L 3,30 ,5-triiodo-L-thyronine, 5% (w/v) BSA, 0.5 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 100 mg/mL EGF.
The culture conditions for H520 and HPAEpiCs are described
in Supplementary Methods.
Measurement of ACh production
A549 cells were grown in SF-RPMI. On the day of the assay,
100 mmol/L neostigmine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor)
was added to each plate (16). Four hours after the addition of
neostigmine, the indicated doses of nicotine were added and

the cells were incubated at 37 C for 36 hours. The supernatant
was collected and spun at 800  g. Subsequently, the supernatant was lyophilized, reconstituted with one-ﬁfth volume
autoclaved water, and stored at 80 C until further analysis.
The amount of ACh in the sample was measured using the
Choline/Acetylcholine Quantiﬁcation Kit (Biovision; refs. 15–
17). Each sample was assayed in triplicate, and the whole
experiment was carried out 2 independent times for each cell
line.
Immunohistochemical staining of VAChT, ChAT in
human BAC tissue microarray and normal lung TMA
Human BAC tissue microarray (TMA) slides (Abnova) were
deparafﬁnized and rehydrated as described previously (19, 20).
The immunostaining was conducted using Vectastain ABC Kit
(Vector Laboratories) following the manufacturer's protocol.
The dilutions of primary antibodies used were 1:50 (polyclonal
VAChT antibody) and 1:25 (monoclonal ChAT antibody). The
images were captured by phase contrast microscopy (Leica
Microsystems) at a magniﬁcation of 400. The normal lung
TMA (US Biomax Inc.) was stained for VAChT and ChAT as
described above.
VAChT, ChAT, and nAChR ELISA assays
The concentration of VAChT and ChAT was measured using
the VAChT ELISA Kit (Antibodies Online Inc.) and the ChAT
ELISA Kit (NovaTein Biosciences), according to manufacturer's instructions. The expression of nAChR subunits in
human BAC cell lines was analyzed by using a7-, a3-, b2-, and
b3- nAChR ELISA Kits (Antibodies Online Inc.). Each of these
assays was completed in duplicate, and the whole experiment
was carried out 2 independent times for each cell line.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling assays
A549 or H358 cells (10,000 cells per well) were seeded into an
8-well chamber slide in SF-RPMI and incubated overnight at
37 C (13, 19). Subsequently, the medium was replaced with SFRPMI-R for 24 hours. After 24 hours, cells were treated with 100
nmol/L nicotine in the presence or absence of 50 mmol/L
vesamicol. Cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37 C. Apoptosis
was measured by the colorimetric TUNEL Assay (Promega
Corporation), according to manufacturer's protocol. The magnitude of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the untreated
control wells was considered to be equal to 1, and the TUNELpositive cells in the remaining wells were calculated as fold
increase relative to the control. The experiment was carried out
2 independent times with 2 replicates in each experiment.
Caspase-3 activity assay
Human BAC cells were incubated in SF-RPMI-R for 24 hours.
Subsequently, cells were treated with 100 nmol/L nicotine in
the presence or absence of 50 mmol/L vesamicol for 48 hours at
37 C. Lysates were made using the Caspase-3 Activity Kit (EMD
Millipore Corporation). Caspase-3 activity in untreated lysates
was considered to be equal to 1, and the activity observed in
treated lysates was calculated as fold increase relative to the

1330

control cells. The experiment was carried out 2 independent
times with 2 replicates in each experiment.
Antitumor studies in nude mice
Four-week-old male nude mice were acclimatized for 1 week
and housed in autoclaved cages with ad libitum access to food
and water in HEPA-ﬁltered racks. A549 cells were resuspended
in a 1:1 (v/v) solution of serum-free media and Matrigel matrix
(BD Biosciences). One million cells were injected subcutaneously between the scapulae of each mouse (15, 21). After the
tumors reached approximately 100 mm3, the mice were randomized into 2 groups, a control (n ¼ 8) and a treatment (n ¼ 8)
group. The control group was fed an AIN-76A–based diet
containing 10% corn oil. The treatment group was fed a diet
containing 50 mg vesamicol/kg food (10 mg vesamicol/kg
body weight) per day. Both groups were administered nicotine
in their drinking water (200 mg/mL in 2% saccharin sodium;
refs. 20, 21). The drug treatment was continued until tumors of
the control group reached approximately 1,500 mm3. Mice
were weighed once per week. Their food consumption and
water consumption were monitored daily. Tumor lengths (l),
widths (w), and height (h) were measured daily (6 d/wk) for
each mouse. Tumor volumes were calculated as (l  w  h)/2
(22, 23). After euthanizing the mice, the tumors were excised.
Half of the tumor was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tumor
lysates were prepared using T-Per lysis buffer (Pierce Biotechnology), according to manufacturer's protocol (24). The other
half of the tumor was ﬁxed in 10% formalin-buffered saline and
used for immunohistochemistry.
Statistical analysis
All data were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5 Software, Inc.
and were represented as the mean  SEM. Results from the
control and treated samples were compared using ANOVA
followed by a Neumann–Keuls multiple comparison test. All
analyses were completed using a 95% conﬁdence interval (CI).
Data were considered signiﬁcant when P < 0.05.

Results
Cholinergic proteins are expressed on BACs
The cholinergic pathway proteins have been traditionally
found in neuromuscular junctions and in neuronal cells (14).
However, studies have shown that genes for these proteins are
found in SCC-L and SCLC cells (14). ELISA experiments
were carried out to examine whether cholinergic proteins were
expressed in human BAC cell lines and in HPAEpiCs. Figure 1A
shows that multiple nAChR subunits are expressed on A549,
H358, and H650 human BAC cells. Similarly, HPAEpiCs also
expressed a diverse array of nAChR subunits. Immunoblotting
experiments were carried out to examine the presence of
AChE, ChAT, CHT1, and VAChT (Fig. 1B) in human BAC cell
lines and in HPAEpiCs. H520 human SCC-L cells were used as
the positive control for both of the experiments. We observed
that human BAC cell lines, as well HPAEpiCs normal lung cells,
express VAChT, ChAT, AChE, and CHT1. The antibodies to
VAChT, ChAT, CHT1, and AChE were found to be speciﬁc and
showed only a single band at the correct molecular weight in
full-screen Western blots (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2D). The

VAChT Inhibition and Bronchioalveolar Carcinoma

Figure 1. Human BACs and normal HPAEpiCs express cholinergic proteins. A, ELISA assays show that human BAC cell lines and HPAEpiCs express multiple
nAChR subunits. The assay was completed in duplicate, and the whole experiment was carried out 2 independent times. Results indicated by a
different letter are signiﬁcantly different (P < 0.05). B, HPAEpiCs and human BACs express AChE, ChAT, CHT1, and VAChT. H520 human SCC-L cells were
used as the positive control for the experiments outlined in A and B. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the
loading control, and the results were quantitated by densitometric analysis. The experiment was repeated twice, and the representative data are shown.
C and D, immunohistochemistry of the human BAC microarray showed that BAC tumors (isolated from patients) express ChAT and VAChT in the cytoplasm,
adjacent to the hematoxylin-counterstained dark nuclei in the tissue samples. A tumor microarray containing 81 cores of human BACs was used for these
experiments and 4 panels of representative photos are shown. Scale bar, 20 mm.

expression of ChAT and VAChT was examined in human BAC
tumors isolated from patients using BAC TMA. The speciﬁc
VAChT and ChAT antibodies described above were used for
the immunostaining. Each TMA contained 81 samples of
human BAC tumors from patients. Human BAC tumors displayed robust expression of both ChAT (Fig. 1C, left) and
VAChT (Fig. 1D, right). Both VAChT and ChAT were found
to be expressed in the cytoplasm. This observation is in
agreement with previous data from several research groups
showing that VAChT and ChAT are localized in the cytoplasm
of cells (25–28). We also analyzed the expression of VAChT and
ChAT in normal lung tissues using normal lung TMA (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). This TMA contained 20 samples
of normal lung tissue. We found that normal lung tissues also
express VAChT and ChAT, and these proteins are localized in
the cytoplasm.
Nicotine induces acetylcholine production in BACs
Next we wanted to assess the effect of nicotine on acetylcholine production in human BACs. We observed that nicotine

www.aacrjournals.org

increased ACh production from A549 cells in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 2A). The maximum ACh production
(2 mmol/L) was observed at 100 nmol/L nicotine and remained
constant thereafter. A similar pattern was observed in H358
and H650 human BAC cells (Fig. 2A). We also carried out a time
kinetics experiment with nicotine on A549 cells and found that
the maximal ACh production (2 mmol/L) occurred at 36 hours
and remained relatively constant thereafter (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we selected a concentration of 100 nmol/L nicotine and a
36-hour time point for all of our ACh production experiments.
A point to note here is that 100 nmol/L nicotine is within the
concentration range found in the plasma of an average smoker
(1 nmol/L–1 mmol/L; ref. 29).
Studies by Song and colleagues have shown that ACh acts as
an autocrine growth factor for SCLCs (16, 17). We analyzed the
mitogenic activity of ACh in human A549 BAC cells and found
that ACh stimulated the proliferation of A549 cells in a
concentration-dependent manner; the maximal proliferation
observed at 2 mmol/L ACh (Fig. 2C, white bars). This ﬁnding is
signiﬁcant because the maximal mitogenic activity of ACh is

and H358 cells. BrdUrd assays
show that 2 mmol/L of ACh (which is
approximately the amount of ACh
produced in nicotine-treated BAC
cells) caused a 4- to 4.5-fold
increase in proliferation of A549
and H358 human BACs. Each
sample was analyzed in triplicate.

similar to the amount of ACh secreted by human BACs. We
repeated the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) cell proliferation
assays in H358 human BAC cells and obtained similar results
(Fig. 2C, black bars). Our observations raise the possibility that
nicotine induces the production of ACh in human BACs, which,
in turn, promotes the growth of human BACs in an autocrine
manner.
Next, we wanted to determine the role of nAChRs in nicotine-induced ACh production. The treatment of A549 cells with
the generalized nAChR antagonist mecamylamine (MCA) suppressed nicotinic-induced ACh production, whereas atropine,
an antagonist to the closely related muscarinic receptor, had
little to no effect on nicotine-induced ACh levels. We obtained
similar results in another human BAC cell line H358. Our
results show that nicotine promotes ACh levels in human
BACs in an nAChR-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig.
S4A).
The next series of experiments aimed to investigate which
speciﬁc nAChR subunits were responsible for nicotine-induced
ACh production. Our data showed that the treatment of
A549 and H358 human BAC cells with a7-nAChR subunit
antagonists, methyllycaconitine (MLA) and a-bungarotoxin
(a-BT), ablated nicotine-induced ACh production. In addition,
1 mmol/L of a-conotoxin MII (a-CT; a3b2 and b3 subunit
antagonist) reversed the pro-secretory effect of nicotine,
whereas DHbE (a3b2 and a4b2 nAChR antagonist) had little

1332

Cancer Res; 73(4) February 15, 2013

to no effect (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Taken together, these
results suggest that nicotine-induced ACh secretion is mediated via nAChRs, speciﬁcally through the a7-, a3b2-, and b3containing nAChR subunits.
Finally, we wanted to examine the effect of choline/acetylcholine transporters on nicotine-induced ACh production. The
treatment of A549 and H358 cells with hemicholinium (an
antagonist of CHT1) suppressed nicotine-induced ACh secretion. Similarly, vesamicol (an antagonist of VAChT) potently
abrogated nicotine-induced ACh production (Supplementary
Fig. S4C). Taken together, this shows that CHT1 and VAChT
function are vital for nicotine-induced ACh production.
Nicotine increases VAChT and ChAT levels in human BAC
cells
We wanted to investigate whether nicotine promoted ACh
secretion via the VAChT/ChAT pathway in BAC cells. We used
an ELISA kit to measure VAChT and ChAT levels, which
allowed us to quantitate these levels in an accurate and
sensitive manner. We observed that the VAChT ELISA Kit
detected VAChT levels in asynchronous A549, H358, and H650
BAC cells and HPAEpic normal lung cells (Supplementary Fig.
S5). The relative pattern of VAChT expression in the ELISA
correlated well with the results obtained from western blotting
(Fig. 1B, fourth panel). ELISA The treatment of A549 cells with
100 nmol/L nicotine caused a 4-fold increase in VAChT levels

Figure 3. Effect of nicotine on
cholinergic proteins in human BACs.
A, the treatment of A549 and H358
cells with 100 nmol/L nicotine
caused 4- to 5-fold increase in
VAChT levels. B, nicotine produces a
modest increase in ChAT levels. C,
nicotine decreases AChE levels in
both A549 and H358 cells. The levels
of CHT1 are relatively unaffected by
nicotine in human BAC cells. Data

(Fig. 3A) and a 1.5-fold increase in ChAT levels (Fig. 3B).
Similarly, nicotine increased VAChT levels in H358 by 5.5-fold
and ChAT levels by 1.4-fold (Fig. 3A and B). We also tested the
effect of nicotine on AChE and CHT1 in human BACs. We
found that nicotine decreased AChE levels in H358 and A549
human BACs (Fig. 3C). The levels of CHT1 were relatively
unaffected by nicotine in both the cell lines (Fig. 3C).
The VAChT antagonist vesamicol causes apoptosis in
human BACs
Our results showed that nicotine-induced ACh production
was blocked by the VAChT inhibitor vesamicol (Supplementary Fig. S4C). It may be envisaged that vesamicol will suppress
nicotine-induced ACh production and thereby block AChinduced growth of human BACs. In addition, we conjectured
that nicotine-induced upregulation of VAChT should provide a
viable molecular target for vesamicol therapy in human BACs.
MTT assays (Supplementary Methods online) showed that
vesamicol decreased the viability of nicotine-treated A549 and
H358 human BAC lines in a concentration-dependent manner.
The maximum reduction in cell viability was observed at 50
mmol/L vesamicol (Fig. 4A). Therefore, we used 50 mmol/L
vesamicol for all further experiments.
Next, we wanted to examine whether vesamicol induced
apoptosis in human BAC cell lines. Quiescent A549 and H358
cells were treated with 100 nmol/L nicotine in the presence or
absence of 50 mmol/L vesamicol. Apoptosis was measured by
TUNEL assays. Figure 4B shows that vesamicol caused robust
apoptosis in both A549 and H358 human BACs. The results of
the TUNEL assays were veriﬁed by caspase-3 activity assay.

apoptosis relative to nicotine-treated human BAC cells
(Fig. 4C).
We also wanted to assess the effect of vesamicol on other
mitogenic signaling pathways in human BACs (30–35). Several
convergent studies indicate that EGF and IGF-II are potent
growth factors for human BAC cells (30–35). We conducted a
BrdUrd assay (Supplementary Methods online) to test the
effect of vesamicol on EGF-induced proliferation of human
BAC cell lines. We found that vesamicol has no effect on EGFinduced proliferation of A549 and H358 human BAC cell lines
(Fig. 4D). Similarly, vesamicol did not affect IGF-II–induced
proliferation of human A549 and H358 cells (Fig. 4E). Our
ﬁndings seem to suggest that vesamicol speciﬁcally inhibits the
acetylcholine-proliferative pathway in human BACs.
Vesamicol induces apoptosis in human BAC cells by
speciﬁcally targeting VAChT
Vesamicol is a well-characterized antagonist of VAChT (36).
However, previous studies indicate that vesamicol also binds to
the sigma-receptor in several types of human cancer cells (37,
38). We wanted to examine whether vesamicol induced apoptosis in human BAC cells by speciﬁcally targeting VAChT. For
this purpose, we used siRNA methodology to suppress the
expression of VAChT or sigma receptor in A549 cells. A549 cells
were transfected with VAChT-siRNA or sigma-receptor siRNA
(Supplementary Methods Online). Eighteen hours posttransfection, the cells were rendered quiescent by incubating them
in SF-RPMI-R medium for 24 hours (19). Subsequently, the cells
were treated with 100 nmol/L nicotine in the presence or
absence of 50 mmol/L vesamicol for 48 hours at 37 C. A549 cells
transfected with a nontargeting control siRNA were used as the

We observed that vesamicol-induced apoptosis was
decreased upon transfection of VAChT-siRNA and unaffected
by sigma-receptor siRNA. The apoptotic activity of vesamicol
was also unaffected by the control nontargeting siRNA

BAC cells. Western blotting experiments show that the levels of
sigma-receptor are ablated upon transfection of sigma-receptor siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S6C and S6D) in both A549 and
H358 cells.
We also examined whether vesamicol was targeting the
VAChT pathway at concentrations lower than 50 mmol/L.
We chose 10 and 25 mmol/L vesamicol for our experiments.
Caspase-3 activity assays show that the cellular apoptosis
induced by 10 mmol/L vesamicol was suppressed by 2
independent sets of VAChT-siRNA in both A549 and H358
cells (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). Similarly, the transfection of VAChT-siRNA efﬁciently abrogated the apoptotic
activity of 25 mmol/L vesamicol in nicotine-treated A549 and
H358 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7C and S7D). ELISA assays
indicate that both the VAChT-siRNA decreased the expression of VAChT in A549 and H358 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S7E). Taken together, our data show that vesamicol caused
apoptosis in human BAC cells by speciﬁcally targeting the
VAChT pathway.

pathway in human BACs
The Akt signaling pathway plays a vital role in nAChR

observed that the treatment of A549 and H358 human BAC
cells with nicotine and vesamicol caused potent decreases in
phosphorylated Akt levels (Fig. 6A and B). The levels of both
phosphorylated Akt (Thr308) and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473)
are robustly suppressed upon vesamicol treatment, whereas
total Akt levels remain constant (Fig. 6A and B, respectively).
Western blotting also showed that vesamicol had little to no
effect on the expression of phosphorylated Akt in untreated
A549 (or H358) cells (Fig. 6C and D). The transfection of
constitutively active Akt (pcDNA3-HA-Akt-CA; Supplementary
Methods Online) reversed the apoptotic effect of vesamicol,
showing that vesamicol induces cell death by suppressing Akt
activation (Fig. 6E and F). Western blotting conﬁrms the
overexpression of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Akt in A549 and
H358 human BAC lines upon transfection (Supplementary Fig.

decreased the tumor growth rate of A549 human BAC tumors

the diet was well tolerated and caused no discomfort or weight

relative to control nicotine-treated mice (Fig. 7C). Our data

Discussion
Our study shows for the ﬁrst time that human BACs produce
ACh and contain a functional acetylcholine signaling system. A
functional cholinergic loop has also been detected in SCLCs,
SCC-L, and normal bronchial epithelial cells (14). Most importantly, nicotine regulates the cholinergic machinery and
increases ACh levels by about 10-fold in human BACs. Nicotine
upregulates the levels of cholinergic proteins, namely VAChT
and ChAT, and concomitantly downregulates AChE in human
BACs. Nicotine-induced increases of VAChT and ChAT promote ACh content and its transport into the extracellular
environment. On the other hand, nicotine decreases AChE
levels, which, in turn, suppress ACh degradation. Thus, the
enhanced levels of ACh provide proliferative stimuli to human
BACs. The ampliﬁcation of the cholinergic network by nicotine
offers novel therapeutic strategies for BAC therapy. These
phenomena are highly signiﬁcant as about 30% of patients
with lung cancer continue to smoke, use nicotine-based ces-

sation patches or gum, or are exposed to environmental
tobacco smoke after their diagnosis (39–41).
We observed that nicotine caused a 3-fold increase in
VAChT and ChAT levels in human BAC cells. This led us to
hypothesize that antagonists of VAChT should attenuate
nicotine-induced ACh production and thereby suppress the
growth of human BACs. As a proof-of-principle, we decided to
use the well-characterized VAChT antagonist, vesamicol, for
our experiments. Our hypothesis was supported by the results
of Song and colleagues who showed that vesamicol suppressed
the growth of H82 human SCLC cells in vitro. We believe that
our results are the ﬁrst to report characterizing the anticancer
activity of VAChT antagonists in human BACs using both
cell culture and in vivo model systems. We found that vesamicol induced robust apoptosis in human BAC cells in both cell
culture and in vivo systems.
A survey of literature shows that only very few studies have
evaluated the antitumor activity of vesamicol. Ogawa and
colleagues evaluated radioiodinated vesamicol analogs for
tumor imaging and antitumor activity (42, 43). They found
that radioiodinated vesamicol analogues suppressed the
growth of human prostate cancer cells in mice model.

However, their results showed that vesamicol exerted its
antitumor activity by binding to the sigma-receptor on DU145
prostate cancer cells (42). Several convergent studies have
shown that vesamicol is also a ligand for the sigma-receptor.
However, our experiments involving VAChT-siRNA and sigmareceptor siRNA showed that the anticancer activity of vesamicol was speciﬁcally mediated by VAChT. It is possible that
sigma-receptors do not play a vital role in nicotine-induced
proliferative signaling in human BAC cells.
The present manuscript shows that apoptotic effects of
vesamicol are mediated via suppression of the Akt pathway.
Clinical studies have shown that the activation of Akt is
highly prevalent in human BAC tumors. Nicotine causes
rapid activation of Akt and its downstream substrates.
Studies by West and colleagues have speculated that inhibition of the Akt pathway may be a viable strategy for
treatment of tobacco-related lung cancers (44, 45). The EGF
receptor (EGFR) inhibitors geﬁtinib and erlotinib have been
shown to suppress Akt phosphorylation in human lung
cancer cells (46, 47). Similarly, phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt inhibitors, that is, LY294002 and deregulin, suppress proliferation of human BAC cells in vitro and in mouse
models of tobacco carcinogenesis (48). Our results suggest
that VAChT antagonists such as vesamicol are another class
of therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting activated Akt in
human BACs.
The acetylcholine signaling pathway has been found to
regulate multiple cellular functions, such as proliferation,
cell-to-cell contact, differentiation, and cytoskeletal integrity
(14). Apart from lung cancer cells, endothelial cells, mesothelial
cells, immune cells, and keratinocytes have been found to
synthesize, transport, and degrade acetylcholine (14). The
pharmacologic manipulation of this non-neuronal cholinergic
system by agents, such as vesamicol, could lead to the devel-

opment of novel therapies for multiple tobacco-related diseases including lung cancer.
