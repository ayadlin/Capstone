ABSTRACT
Overexpression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in human cancer contributes
to tumor metastasis, but the role of 5-HT receptor family in cancer has not been
thoroughly explored. Here, we report overexpression of 5-HT1D receptor (5-HT1DR) was
associated with Wnt signaling pathway and advanced tumor stage. The underlying
mechanism of 5-HT1DR-promoted tumor invasion was through its activation on the
Axin1/β-catenin/MMP-7 pathway. In an orthotopic colorectal cancer mouse model,
we demonstrated that a 5-HT1DR antagonist (GR127935) effectively inhibited tumor
metastasis through targeting Axin1. Furthermore, in intestinal epithelium cells, we
observed that 5-HT1DR played an important role in cell invasion via Axin1/β-catenin/
MMP-7 pathway. Together, our findings reveal an essential role of the physiologic
level of 5-HT1DR in pulmonary metastasis of colorectal cancer.

cancer and bladder cancer have been investigated [5–7],
there is a lack of evidence regarding whether these
receptors play a significant role in CRC.
It has been found that the activation of Wnt signaling
in colorectal cancer correlates with more invasive tumor
growth, a higher susceptibility of disease recurrence
after surgery, and a lower survival rate [8]. However, the
underlying molecular mechanism of Wnt signaling is not
clear. Recently, a report has shown that 5-HT1B receptors
on osteoblasts inhibit cell proliferation by activating
PKA and CREB in Wnt signaling [9]. Although there is
a great contribution of 5-HT1 group receptors in signaling
pathway including Wnt signaling [10], there is a lack of
evidence of Wnt signaling on the impact of 5-HT receptors
in colorectal cancers.
In this study, we first clarified the molecular
mechanism by which 5-HT1D receptor (5-HT1DR) inhibits

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading
causes of cancer-related human morbidity and mortality
worldwide [1]. Despite recent advances in the diagnosis
and therapy of CRC, the general survival rate of CRC
patients has not improved [2]. Metastasis disposes patients
to poor prognosis and is the main cause of mortality [3].
The molecular mechanisms underlying CRC metastasis
are not quite clear to date.
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is
a neurotransmitter that mediates a wide variety of
physiological events including central and peripheral
action through the binding of multiple receptor subtypes
[4]. Although the mitogenic events of serotonin receptors,

5-HT1DR competitively bound to Axin1 and
released Axin1 from the destruction complex

Wnt signaling, then we disclosed the direct effect of
5-HT1DR on Axin1. We demonstrated that inhibition
of 5-HT1DR has potent anti-metastatic effect via Wnt
signaling pathway. Our results provided the Wnt targeted
mechanism to better understand CRC metastasis.

Western blotting analysis revealed that the family
members of 5-HTR protein were differentially expressed
in 4 human CRC cells (LoVo, HCT-116, HT-29 and
SW403) (Figure 2A). As we know, LoVo cells are a well
differentiated cells. Interestingly, 5-HT1DR, 5-HT1BR and
5-HT1FR were more overexpressed in LoVo cells than
that in HCT-116 cells, which are poor differentiated
cells. Since previous evidence indicated that targeting
5-HT1D receptor subsequently targets Wnt pathway,
we investigated which factor is involved in 5-HT1DR
regulating Wnt pathway. First, using sumatriptan to
increase the level of 5-HT1DR, we found the expression
of 5-HT1DR in HCT-116 was upregulated, whereas
5-HT1DR protein was downregulated in LoVo cells in a
dose-dependent manner after treatment with GR127935
(Figure 2B). Second, to verify the effect of 5-HT1DR
on canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, other
components of the “destruction complex” including
APC, Axin1, GSK3β and CKIα were tested. As shown
in Figure 2C, when sumatriptan was applied, the Axin1
level was markedly decreased in HCT-116 cells, but
increased in LoVo cells (Figure 2C and right-upper).
Consistent with our findings in Axin1 expression,
β-catenin protein showed a decreased expression in the
cytoplasm of HCT-116 cells, but an increased expression
in the HCT-116 nucleus in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 2C). These findings suggest that 5-HT1DR is a
gene involved in the response to nuclear accumulation
of β-catenin in activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
As protein interaction is the first step for epigenetic
regulation, we then checked whether 5-HT1DR is
associated with Axin1 by ChIP analysis. Among the
three members APC, Axin1, GSK3β and CKIα of the
destruction complex family, only Axin1 co-precipitated
with 5-HT1DR in 5-HT1DR overexpression LoVo
colorectal cancer cells (Figure 2D).

RESULTS
5-HT1DR is overexpressed in CRC tumors
To study the expression pattern of HTR in
colorectal cancer, the protein level of 5-HT1R,
5-HT2R, 5-HT3R and 5-HT7R were quantified by
immunohistochemical staining in 90 pairs of colorectal
cancers and matched adjacent normal colon tissue
samples. Upregulation of 5-HT1DR, 5-HT3CR and 5-HT4R
protein level was observed in colorectal cancer samples
compared with the paired normal tissues (Figure 1A).
Notably, the expression of 5-HT1DR (68 out of 90,
76%) was observed being the highest among all 5-HT
receptors.Then we divided the patients into two groups:
high level of 5-HT1DR (68) and low level of 5-HT1DR
(22). Statistical analysis indicated that patients with high
level of 5-HT1DR had significantly worse overall survival
(OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared with
patients with low level of 5-HT1DR (Figure 1 B). This
was not associated with sex, age, tumor grade, carcinoembryonic antigen (CFA) and fetoprotein (AFP) level
(Supplementary Table S1).The 5-year OS was 48.8%
for high level of 5-HT1DR and 64.7% for low level of
5-HT1DR patients (p = 0.0023). The 5-year PFS was
39.9% for high level of 5-HT1DR and 56.2% for low level
of 5-HT1DR patients (p = 0.0038).
To further characterize the role of 5-HT1DR
overexpression in colorectal cancer, we performed a
full cDNA microarray to screen for different expression
of cancer genes in 7 pairs of patient-matched normal
tissues (data not shown). As viewed in Figure 1C and
Supplementary Figure S1, a total of 16 genes were
differentially upregulated (by more than 10 times), and
involved seven signal pathways. Interestingly, components
of the Wnt signaling pathway, including MMP-7,
β-catenin, and APC, were significantly upregulated in high
5-HT1D R tumor tissue, implying a possible link between
5-HT1D R and Wnt signaling pathway in CRC patients.
Importantly, in 68 CRC patients with high level of
5-HT1DR, a positive and significant association between
5-HT1DR and c-myc or MMP-7 gene was observed
(Figure 1D), whereas no such correlation was seen
in the other 14 genes. MMP-7 is a known downstream
target of Wnt signaling pathway and protein MMP-7
can be upregulated when the Wnt signaling pathway are
activated. Collectively, our results suggest a possible link
between 5-HT1DR upregulation and Wnt/MMP-7 signaling
pathway in CRC progression.

5-HT1DR regulated Axin1/β-catenin/LEF1/TCF4/
MMP-7 signaling
Since LEF1/TCF4 is one of the major downstream
of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, we hypothesized that 5-HT1DR
may utilize Axin1/β-catenin/LEF/TCF4 to influence its
metastatic effects. We evaluated the level of LEF/TCF4
in LoVo cells with or without sumatriptan treatment
after transfected with Axin1-overexpressing vector.
As expected, the level of LEF/TCF4 was significantly
upregulated in Axin1-overexpressing LoVo cells compared
to that of LoVo cells transfected with empty vector (Figure
3A). Importantly, the combination of sumatriptan and
Axin1-overexpressing vector offset the inhibitory effect of
Axin1, suggesting that 5-HT1DR regulates the expression
of Wnt/β-catenin/LEF/TCF4 specifically through Axin1

separated from the destruction complex. To further clarify
the molecular mechanisms of the 5-HT1DR activation of
the Axin1/β-catenin/LEF/TCF4 pathway, we compared
the expression profiles of Wnt-related molecules in LoVo
cells including MMP-7, cyclin D1, c-Myc, MMP-2 and
MMP-9. Western blot result showed that only expression
of MMP-7 changed with a similar trend as the level of
LEF1/TCF4 (Figure 3B). The findings from this study
revealed an inherent role of 5-HT1DR which binds Axin1
and dissociates β-catenin from the complex, moving
β-catenin into the nucleus to activate the β-catenin/LEF1/
TCF4/MMP-7 pathway in colorectal cancer metastasis
(Figure 3C).

of mice treated with GR127935 compared with that
of the control group. Similar to the result in vitro, the
levels of β-catenin, LEF1, TCF4 and MMP-7 increased
after treatment with GR127935 compared with those
of the control group (Figure 5B). Next, we generated
a xenograft tumor model using fluorescence-labeled
Axin1-overexpressed colorectal cancer cell. When we
treated these tumor-bearing mice with sumatriptan,
the fluorescence activity of Axin1 decreased in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 5C). We also used
fluorescently-labeled Axin1-overexpressed cells in
a colonic orthotopic xenograft. After sumatriptan
treatment for 28 days, the fluorescent activity of Axin1
was significantly attenuated compared with that of the
control group (Figure 5D). Furthermore, we examined
the invasion and migration by hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining in main organ tissue slices. We found
more colonic metastases in liver and lung tissue in
Axin1-overexpressed group, which were decreased in
Axin1-overespressed group treated with sumatriptan
(Figure 5E). Corresponding survival curves showed a
significantly increase in median survival of sumatriptantreated group. We also saw that the luc-vector group
had significantly prolonged overall survival than the
Axin1-overexpressed group with or without sumatriptan
(Figure 5F).

5-HT1DR modulates colorectal cancer invasion/
migration in vitro
To determine whether the 5-HT1DR may play a
role in tumor invasion, GR127935 was applied to LoVo
cells and analyzed using a scratch-wound motility
assay. The data in Figure 4A showed a time and dosedependent downregulation of cell migration in response
to GR127935 treatment, as shown by as much as 40%
delay in wound closure at 48 hours post-treatment with
the highest dose of GR127935 (Figure 4A right). Similar
results were seen in Matrigel-coated Transwell assays,
in which LoVo cells were treated with GR127935 in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 4B). In addition to the
offset effect of sumatriptan to Axin1, we also elucidate
the role of sumatriptan in Axin1-mediated cell migration.
Transfection of Axin1-overexpressed vector and a specific
sumatriptan dose were used to inhibit the activity of Axin1
mediated signaling pathway in LoVo cells. As expected,
compared with vector cells, Axin1-overexpressing cells
showed more migration activity; however the activity was
decreased after adding sumatriptan (Figure 4C). Finally,
we evaluated cell viability after GR127935 treatment with
the trypan blue exclusion assay. As shown in Figure 4D
and 4E, the proliferation and migration of LoVo cells
remained unchanged, implying that 5-HT1DR plays a
key role in the regulatory effect of Axin1-mediated cell
migration without the proliferation change.

5-HT1DR modulates colorectal cancer invasion/
migration in IECs
Because increased motility and invasion are
among the principal effects of upregulated Axin1/βcatenin signaling, those features were tested in 5-HT1DR
overexpressing colorectal cancer cells. To test whether
5-HT1DR also regulate motility and invasion via Axin1/βcatenin signaling in intestinal epithelium cells, we use
Caco-2 cell as intestinal epithelium cells, and measured
the level of 5-HT1DR with or without sumatriptan and
GR127935. Western blot results showed a low level of
5-HT1DR in Caco-2 cell, and sumatriptan or GR127935
could increase or decrease the level of 5-HT1DR
respectively (Figure 6A). Next, we assessed its toxicity
in Caco-2 cells. As shown in Figure 6B, sumatriptan or
GR127935 treatments do not significantly inhibit cell
growth or slow the rate of Caco-2 cell cycle (Figure 6C).
To investigate the potential mechanism of Caco-2 cells
and LoVo cells, we used PCR to examine the expression
of mRNA in 19 genes including their difference in the
tumor sample previously found and Axin1, LEF1, TCF4.
As shown in Figure 6D, Axin1, β-catenin, LEF, TCF4 and
MMP-7 were downregulated in Caco-2 cells. Furthermore,
we also tested the effect of sumatriptan in the Axin1/βcatenin-related signal pathway, which has been verified
in LoVo cells. Figure 6E and 6F showed that 5-HT1DR
may utilize Axin1/β-catenin/LEF/TCF4 to influence its
metastatic effects.

5-HT1DR modulates colorectal cancer invasion/
migration in vivo
To further test our hypothesis of 5-HT1DR’s role
in migration and invasion in vivo, we first established
a subcutaneous xenograft tumor model of colorectal
cancer cell line. Compared with normal saline group,
the tumor growths were not apparent after treatment
with GR127935 (Figure 5A). The toxicity of GR127935
was evaluated by observing the body weight, and no
significant weight loss was observed (Supplementary
Figure S2). However, immunohistochemistry analyses
of Axin1 displayed a downregulation in the tumor

the molecular mechanisms underlying 5-HT1DR in CRC
metastasis are still unclear.
Wnt pathway is known as a “destruction complex”
in which Axin and adenomatous polypopsis coli (APC)
form a scaffold facilitating β-catenin phosphorylated by
CK1a and GSK3β at serine and threonine residues in its
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

amino-terminal region [21, 22]. In a normal steady state, the
cells are not exposed to Wnt signaling [23, 24]. However,
activation of Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway
is thought to lead to a higher susceptibility of disease
recurrence after surgery and a lower survival rate [25, 26].
Its mechanism is illustrated as follows: Axin dissociates

from the APC/Axin/GSK/β-catenin-complex, then β-catenin
translocates to the nucleus where it binds to T-cell factors
(Tcf) and activates the transcription of specific target genes,
including c-Myc, cyclin D1 and MMP7 [27, 28].
Because of the demonstrated relationship between
5-HT1DR, Wnt/β-catenin and MMP-7 from clinical data
analysis, we hypothesized that 5-HT1DR may be involved
in Wnt/β-catenin/MMP-7 mediated CRC metastasis. We
increased 5-HT1DR expression in HCT-116 cell using an
agonist, and revealed a concomitant reduction in Axin1
protein level and a concomitant increase of β-catenin
protein level in the nucleus. On the contrary, GR127935
had the opposite effect in LoVo cells. Previous studies
have illustrated the separation of “destruction complex”
leading to an increased in Axin and [β-catenin/TCF]
signaling in the cellular environment [29, 30]. Although
APC and GSK3β are reported to be components of the
“destruction complex”, we did not find significant changes
in the expression levels of APC or GSK3β after the two
colorectal cancer cells treatment with sumatriptan or
GR127935. Therefore, it seems that highly-differentiated
cells have an intrinsic mechanism to target Axin1 and
activate β-catenin/TCF signaling pathway [31], which
is still maintained when the overall level of 5-HT1DR is
elevated in cancer cells. Furthermore, the ChIP assay
also confirmed that the 5-HT1DR protein could bind to the
Axin1 gene promoter in LoVo cells, but not to APC or
GSK3β. Additionally, the results also showed that 5-HT1DR
did not affect the other gene, only changed the level of
MMP-7. CTHRC1 was also reported to be an activator
of the planar cell polarity pathway of Wnt signaling in
mouse embryogenesis [32]. In this work, we also provide
some insights into the biological effects of overexpression
of 5-HT1DR in CRC. Our in vitro data further showed that
GR127935 functions as a tumor suppressor via Axin1/βcatenin/MMP-7 pathway in the cell cycle, proliferation,
and invasion. This is the first work that we know of to
use a mouse model system of Axin1-overexpression on
the primary colon tumors to identify the effect of 5-HT1DR
in metastasis.
There are indications that some additional genetic or
epigenetic alterations are required in normal cells, thereby
leading to a gain-of-function phenotype. In agreement
with this possibility, our results in the normal primary
colon cell, as well as studies by others report, show that
the activation of Axin1/β-catenin/MMP-7 pathway is
acquired only after 5-HT1DR activation.
We reported in our study that 5-HT1DR activated
Axin1/β-catenin/MMP-7-mediated signaling by targeting
Axin1 directly induces potent invasion and migration
activity both in vitro and in vivo.The correlation between
5-HT1DR expression and Axin1 further provided a
mechanism-based rationale to target Axin1. In conclusion,
we suggest that Axin1/β-catenin/MMP-7 may be a useful
prognostic marker for CRC progression and in determining

the sensitivity of 5-HT1DR as a potential target for patients
with CRC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
The human colorectal cancer LoVo, HCT-116, HT-29
and SW403 cell lines were purchased from the Shanghai
Cell Collection (Shanghai, China). Cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heatinactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml
penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) at 37°C in a 5% CO2-humidified
atmosphere. Monoclonal antibodies against 5-HT family,
Axin1, β-catenin, APC, GSK3β, CKIα, LEF1, TCF4,
cyclin D1, c-Myc, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-7 and β-actin
were products of Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
MA, USA). 5-HT1DR agonist (Sumatriptan) and 5-HT1DR
antagonist (GR127935) were from Sigma Chemical Co.
(St.Louis, MO).

Clinical samples
From 2008 to 2014, unifocal, primary CRC
biopsies surgically resected from 90 patients, who
received detailed pathological assessment and regular
follow-up at Shuguang Hospital Shanghai University
of Traditional Chinese Medicine were collected for
this study. The basic clinical characteristics of the
90 patients are presented in Supplementary Table S1. All
of the donors or their guardians provided written consent
and ethics permission was obtained for the use of all
samples. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics
and Human Clinical Trial Committee of the affiliated
hospitals, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese
Medicine.

Immunohistochemical analysis
The hydrated paraffin section were incubated in
a blocking solution (10% donkey serum +5% nonfat
dry milk +4% BSA +0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min,
and then incubated at 4°C overnight with anti-5-HT
family antibody. After washing with PBS, the sections
were incubated with diluted (1:200) biotinylated
secondary antibody for 30 min. Subsequently, the
sections were washed again in PBS and incubated
for 30 min with the preformed avidin-horseradish
peroxidase macromolecular complex. Development
of peroxidase reaction was achieved by incubation
in 0.01% 3, 3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
(DAB) in PBS containing 0.01% hydrogen peroxide for
approximately 5 min at room temperature. Sections were

then washed thoroughly in tap water, counterstained in
haematoxylin, dehydrated in absolute alcohol, cleared in
xylene and mounted in synthetic resin for microscopic
examination.

Cells were treated with 100 nM Dasatinib or
DMSO for 24–72 h. Cell cycle was determined using the
FITC BrdU Flow kit (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA,
USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions [13].
Subsequently, cells were washed once with PBS and
analyzed by FACS. The percentage of cells in various
phases of the cell cycle, namely, G1, G2, and S, were
analyzed using ModFit software.

Transfection of lentivirus
Transfection procedures were performed according
to manufacturers’ instructions, with Lipofectamin 2000 as
transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Axin1-GFP/luciferase
lentivirus and control GFP/luciferase Lentivirus were used
to transfect LoVo cells. In brief, 2 × 105 cells were plated
in each well of a 24-well plate and incubated overnight.
Lentiviral supernatants were added to cells according the
concentration of lentivirus for 12 h. The GFP positive cells
were sorted and the stable clones were isolated.

Cell invasion and wound healing assays
The Matrigel invasion assay was done using the BD
Biocoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber (pore size: 8 mm, 24well; BD Biosciences, USA) following the manufacturer’s
protocol [14]. From five randomly selected fields, the invading
cells were counted under a light microscope.For woundhealing assay, cell monolayers were scratched with a clean
pipette tip and cell migration was observed for up to 24 h.

Analysis of gene expression
Total RNAs were reverse-transcribed to cDNA using
The Advantage RT-PCR Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.,
MountainView, CA, USA). For quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR), target gene expression was normalized
to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression.
Primers are described in online Supplementary Table S2.

Animals and xenograft models
Male athymic nude mice (NCr-nu), 8–12 weeks
old, were purchased from Sino-British SIPPR/BK lab
Animal Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China, license No. SCXK
2008-0016), and maintained under specific-pathogenfree conditions. All animal protocols were approved by
the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. All the
experiments and animal care were approved by Shanghai
Medical Experimental Animal Care Commission
and in accordance with the Provision and General
Recommendation of Chinese Experimental Animals
Administration Legislation
For experiment 1, 24 mice were subcutaneously
injected with 1.0 × 106 LoVo cells per animal. When
the tumors reach an average size of 100 mm3, the mice
were randomized into 4 groups (n = 6 per group) and
received intragastric administration of 5-HT1DR antagonist
(GR127935) at the doses of 0 mg/kg, 0.617 mg/kg,
1.233 mg/kg and 2.466 mg/kg every day as previously
described [15]
For experiment 2, 24 mice were subcutaneously
injected with Axin1-overexpressed luciferase LoVo
cells per animal. When the tumors reach an average
size of 100 mm3, the mice were randomized into 4
groups (n = 12 per group) and received intragastric
administration of sumatriptan at the doses of 20.55 mg/
kg, 41.1 mg/kg and 82.2 mg/kg. In clinical practice,
5-HT1DR agonist (Sumatriptan) is usually prescribed at a
maximum daily dose of 200 mg. When this human dose
is converted into an animal dose (a person of 60 kg, and
a conversion factor of 12.33 between human and mouse),
it was equivalent to the middle dose (41.1 mg/kg) used in
this study. Six mice were sacrificed in each group on the

Western blot analysis
Whole cell lysates for Western blot analysis of
5-HTR family, Axin1, β-catenin, APC, GSK3β, CKIα,
LEF1, TCF4, cyclin D1, c-Myc, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-7
and β-actin expression were prepared as previously
reported [11]. Briefly, the cells were lysed on ice in
immunoprecipitation assay buffer for 2 h before being
homogenized using a mortar and pestle. The homogenized
sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected
and stored at -80°C until used. Densitometric analysis
was performed using the Scion Imaging software (Scion
Corporation), with β-actin as internal reference.

Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation was performed as described
previously [11], except N-ethylmaleimide was added to
the cell lysis buffer at a final concentration of 10 mM to
preserve poly-ubiquitinated protein conjugates.

Cell viability assay
Cells were stained with 2 mg/ml propidium iodide
as described previously [12]. Events in live cell gate were
counted by an FACS Calibur. Ratio of live to total events
was calculated as percent viability. All experiments were
done with 5 replicates per experiment and repeated at least
3 times.

28th day after treatment (35 day after transplantation),
the other 6 mice in the same group were observed longer
for survival time
For experiment 3, 24 mice underwent colon
orthotopic transplantation with Axin1-overexpressed
luciferase or vector luciferase LoVo cells per animal.
The treatment was similar to experiment 2, except that
the time of intragastric administration of sumatriptan
started from 30 days after transplantation due to a
prior observation that metastasis of colorectal cancer
needs at least one month to take place [16]. Six mice
were sacrificed in each group on the 60th day after
transplantation, the other 6 mice in the same group were
observed longer for survival time. The body weight of
the animals and the two perpendicular diameters (A and
B) were recorded every 3 days and tumor volume (V)
was estimated according to the following formula [16]
:V= π/6 × [(A+B)/2]3. The survival time for each group
and overall significance was plotted on a Kaplan-Meier
survival curve using GraphPad Prism
