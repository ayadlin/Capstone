Abstract
Combinations of MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors have shown
promise in preclinical cancer models, leading to the initiation of clinical trials cotargeting these two key cancer
signaling pathways. GDC-0973, a novel selective MEK inhibitor, and GDC-0941, a class I PI3K inhibitor, are in early
stage clinical trials as both single agents and in combination. The discovery of these selective inhibitors has
allowed investigation into the precise effects of combining inhibitors of two major signaling branches
downstream of RAS. Here, we investigated multiple biomarkers in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
and PI3K pathway to search for points of convergence that explain the increased apoptosis seen in combination.
Using washout studies in vitro and alternate dosing schedules in mice, we showed that intermittent inhibition of
the PI3K and MAPK pathway is sufﬁcient for efﬁcacy in BRAF and KRAS mutant cancer cells. The combination
of GDC-0973 with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 resulted in combination efﬁcacy in vitro and in vivo via induction
of biomarkers associated with apoptosis, including Bcl-2 family proapoptotic regulators. Therefore, these data
suggest that continuous exposure of MEK and PI3K inhibitors in combination is not required for efﬁcacy in
preclinical cancer models and that sustained effects on downstream apoptosis biomarkers can be observed in
response to intermittent dosing. Cancer Res; 72(1); 210–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) signaling cascade transduces
multiple proliferation and differentiation signals within the cell
via activation of the RAS GTPase and subsequent sequential
activation of RAF, MEK, and extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK). Aberrant regulation of this pathway contributes
to many hallmarks of cancer cells, including uncontrolled
proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and evasion
of apoptosis (1, 2). Inhibition of MEK is a promising strategy in
the development of oncology therapeutics to control the
growth of tumors that are dependent on aberrant MEK pathway signaling (3–5). The MEK pathway is upregulated in a large

fraction of tumors, in part, due to mutation of several components of the pathway. Oncogenic-activating mutations have
been identiﬁed in KRAS (22% of all cancers), NRAS (8%), HRAS
(3%), and BRAF (20%; COSMIC database; ref. 6). Activating
BRAF mutations, the majority of which are a single amino acid
substitution (V600E) in the activation loop of the kinase (6, 7),
are prevalent in malignant melanomas (66%) and are also
found in colon cancer (15%) and thyroid papillary carcinoma
(27%). Cancer cells transformed by BRAF V600E are highly
sensitive to MEK1/2 inhibition (4, 8). In addition to RAS and
RAF mutations, many tumors are activated by ampliﬁcation or
overexpression of upstream pathway components. Therefore,
MEK1/2 inhibitors may have broad utility in tumors with
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations.
PI3K–AKT pathway activation has been implicated in several types of cancer (9, 10). Activating and transforming
mutations in the p110a subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) are commonly found in multiple tumor types (11–13). In
addition, the pathway is activated in numerous types of cancer
by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, RAS mutations, or
the loss of the phosphatase PTEN (10).
Targeting either of these pathways individually can attenuate signaling and has been shown to be efﬁcacious in animal
models (14, 15). However, in some tumors, cell proliferation
and survival are driven through multiple effector pathways,
such as in tumors with concurrent activation of the RAS and
PI3K pathways, as is seen in a subset of melanoma, lung, and

Antitumor Efﬁcacy by Intermittent Dosing of MEK and PI3K Inhibitors

colorectal cancers. Targeting both of these pathways is significantly more efﬁcacious in preclinical models than targeting
either pathway alone (15, 16). Pathway feedback, resulting in
activation of parallel pathways in response to targeted inhibitors, can also contribute to combination efﬁcacy (15–18).
GDC-0973 is a novel small-molecule inhibitor of MEK that is
potent and highly selective. The results presented here show
that when GDC-0973 is combined with the PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 in cancer models, it results in combination efﬁcacy in vitro
and in vivo via induction of biomarkers associated with apoptosis, including Bcl-2 family proapoptotic regulators (19).
These ﬁndings suggest that intermittent dosing regimens may
be efﬁcacious for combinations of MEK and PI3K inhibitors in
the clinic and that sustained exposure to inhibitors may not be
required for maximal combination efﬁcacy.

Materials and Methods
Cell line single-nucleotide polymorphism ﬁngerprinting
Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was
carried out for all cell lines except 888MEL, DU-145.X1, and
NCI-H520.X1. Cells were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection. Cell line identity was veriﬁed by high
throughput SNP genotyping using Illumina Golden gate
multiplexed assays. SNPs were selected on the basis of minor
allele frequency and presence on commercial genotyping
platforms. SNP proﬁles were compared with SNP calls from
the Sanger database to conﬁrm ancestry for the following
cell lines: 22Rv1, A2058, A375, A549, Calu-6, FaDu, HCT-116,
LoVo, MiaPaCa-2, NCI-H2122, NCI-H441, NCI-H460, and
SKOV-3.

were quantiﬁed by the LI-COR Odyssey immunoblotting
system.
Pharmacodynamic assays
Frozen tumors were pulverized on dry ice using a small
Bessman tissue pulverizer (Spectrum Laboratories) and prepared according to the manufacturer. For subsequent Western
blot analysis, proteins were resolved by 4% to 12% SDS-PAGE
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Corporation) and immunoblotting carried out as described earlier.
Tumor and body weight measurement
Tumor volumes were determined with digital calipers (Fred
V. Fowler Company, Inc.) using the formula (L  W  W)/2.
Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated as the percentage of the area under the ﬁtted curve (AUC) for the respective
dose group per day in relation to the vehicle, such that %TGI ¼
100  [1  (AUCtreatment/d)/(AUCvehicle/d)]. Curve ﬁtting was
applied to log2-transformed individual tumor volume data
using a linear mixed-effects model with the R package nlme,
version 3.1-97 in R v2.12.0.

this cell line panel, 63% of cancer cell lines with oncogenic
mutations in PIK3CA were sensitive to GDC-0941 (Supplementary Table S2). A higher percentage of RAF and RAS mutant cell
lines are resistant to GDC-0941 than RAF and RAS wild-type
cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1).

MEK1. In biochemical assays, GDC-0973 showed more than
100-fold selectivity for MEK when tested against a panel of
more than 100 serine–threonine and tyrosine kinases (Supplementary Table S1).
GDC-0973 shows strong cellular potency in a broad panel of
tumor types, particularly in BRAF or KRAS mutant cancer cell
lines (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S2). In a panel of cancer cell
lines, 80% of BRAF mutant lines (including V600E and nonV600E mutations) were sensitive to GDC-0973, 54% of lines
carrying oncogenic mutations in KRAS or NRAS were sensitive,
and 35% of the remaining lines were sensitive. As not all RAF
and RAS mutant lines are sensitive to MEK inhibition, and not
all wild-type lines are resistant, there are clearly additional
genetic factors affecting sensitivity and resistance to MEK
inhibition.
GDC-0941 is a potent inhibitor of class I PI3K isoforms with
biochemical IC50 values of 3 to 75 nmol/L for the 4 class I
isoforms of PI3K (14). This compound shows excellent selectivity against mTOR, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK), and a panel of more than 228 kinases (14). GDC-0941
shows strong inhibition of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo,
especially those with activated PI3K pathway signaling (21). In

GDC-0973 has antitumor efﬁcacy in BRAF and KRAS
mutant human xenograft tumor models
GDC-0973 showed activity in a number of human tumor
xenograft models, particularly in models mutant for BRAF.
Two dose-ranging efﬁcacy studies in BRAF mutant and KRAS
mutant human xenograft models are shown in Fig. 2. In the
A375.X1 BRAFV600E mutant melanoma xenograft model, treatment with doses of GDC-0973 above 3 mg/kg led to strong TGI
(Fig. 2A). In the NCI-H2122 KRASG12C mutant non–small cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) xenograft model, treatment with up
to 5 mg/kg GDC-0973 led to moderate TGI and at 10 mg/kg
approached tumor stasis (Fig. 2B). GDC-0973 was tested in
additional xenograft tumors with different genetic backgrounds and showed varying degrees of TGI across tumor
types and genotypes (Table 1). There was a high degree of
sensitivity to GDC-0973 in BRAFV600E mutant melanoma

low doses and regression at high doses. An exception was the
A2058 BRAF mutant model, where the loss of PTEN may be a
resistance factor (8). Apart from BRAFV600E mutant models,
there was no strict correlation of tumor inhibition with genotype. In particular, maximal tumor inhibition for KRAS mutant
models ranged from 9% to 108% and tumor inhibition in KRAS
wild-type models ranged from 21% to 96%, again suggesting
that additional genetic factors contribute to the sensitivity to
single-agent MEK inhibition.

intensities were quantiﬁed and plotted relative to vehicletreated mice (time: 0 h). In the A375.X1 model, dose- and

time-dependent suppression of p-ERK was observed, with the
10 mg/kg dose of GDC-0973 suppressing p-ERK 75% at 2, 8, and

model, GDC-0973 inhibited p-ERK 83% at 8 hours and 73% at 24
hours (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. S2). Lower doses of GDC0973 showed weaker suppression of p-ERK over time and dose
dependency consistent with the single-agent antitumor activity of GDC-0973 in the A375.X1 and NCI-H2122 models,
respectively.

Figure 3. Combination of GDC-0973 þ GDC-0941 results in reduced viability, pathway inhibition, and increased apoptosis. A, the 888MEL and A2058 BRAF
mutant melanoma cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 as single agents and in combination and assayed in a
96-hour viability assay. The highest drug concentrations corresponded to 4 EC50 doses for 888MEL (0.2 mmol/L GDC-0973, 10 mmol/L GDC-0941) and
A2058 (10 mmol/L GDC-0973, 10 mmol/L GDC-0941) cells. B, top, melanoma cells were treated with 1 half maximal effective concentration (EC50)
concentration of MEK and PI3K inhibitors for 24 hours (888MEL: 0.05 mmol/L GDC-0973, 2.5 mmol/L GDC-0941; A2058: 2.5 mmol/L GDC-0973, 2.5 mmol/L
GDC-0941), and protein lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. Bottom, RNA was extracted from the melanoma cells treated with 1 EC50 drug
concentration for 16 hours and analyzed by TaqMan gene expression assay. Bim RNA levels are normalized to GAPDH. C, A2058 cells were treated with
distinct siRNA oligonucleotide pools to Bim for 72 hours and subsequently treated for 24 hours with the indicated concentrations of GDC-0941 or GDC-0973
and analyzed by the Cell Death Detection ELISA assay. Differences in cell death induction by GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 combination in the presence or
absence of Bim were statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.05).

4-day CellTiter-Glo viability assay. GDC-0941 and GDC-0973
act cooperatively to inhibit the viability of all melanoma cell
lines tested, 60% of which carry oncogenic mutations in BRAF
(Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Table S2). GDC0941 and GDC-0973 were also tested in a panel of NSCLC cell
lines. Because the compounds showed efﬁcacy as single agents
in most of the NSCLC cell lines, synergy could be assessed in
these lines with Calcusyn, a program using the Chou and
Talalay combination index (CI) method for calculating the
level of synergy (20). Strong synergy or synergy, as indicated by
CI values less than or equal to 0.3 or 0.3 to 0.7, respectively, was
observed for 74% (n ¼ 35 of 47) of NSCLC cell lines, of which
approximately half carry oncogenic mutations in KRAS (Supplementary Table S2). The remaining 26% of lung cancer cell
lines could not be evaluated for synergy because one of the
compounds showed no efﬁcacy as a single agent. There was no
statistically signiﬁcant genotype dependence of combination
efﬁcacy with respect to BRAF or KRAS mutation status in the
cell lines tested.
The effects of combined MEK and PI3K pathway inhibition
on downstream pathway markers were evaluated in cell lines.
Analysis of downstream pathway markers in the 888MEL
(BRAF V600E) and A2058 (BRAFV600E) mutant melanoma
cell lines showed that treatment with GDC-0973 decreased pERK whereas treatment with GDC-0941 decreased p-AKT in

214

these cell lines (Fig. 3B). Whereas GDC-0941 was able to
decrease phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) moderately on its own, pS6 showed greater decrease in response to
the combination at both the S235/236 and S240/244 sites in
multiple tumor cell lines (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S5A). The
single agent and combination treatments were also assessed
for their effect on apoptotic markers. Treatment with GDC0973 and GDC-0941 resulted in a combinatorial increase of
cellular mediators of apoptosis, such as cleaved PARP and
alternatively spliced isoforms of Bim (Fig. 3B; ref. 19). The
majority of cell lines tested showed a stronger response of Bim
to GDC-0973 than to GDC-0941, whereas the increase in
cleaved PARP was equally dependent on both compounds
(Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S5A), suggesting additional apoptotic mechanisms are involved. Consistent with expectations
based on the published literature (22, 23), combined GDC-0973
and GDC-0941 treatment increased Bim levels via several
complementary mechanisms, including gene expression,
BimEL phosphorylation, and Bim protein stabilization.
Decreases of pS6 and Bim in tumors were also observed in
vivo in response to the combination (Supplementary Fig. S5B
and S5C). To conﬁrm the functional contribution of Bim in
mediating apoptosis induced by MEK and PI3K inhibition,
RNA interference studies were conducted to ablate Bim in
melanoma cells (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). In

Antitumor Efﬁcacy by Intermittent Dosing of MEK and PI3K Inhibitors

0973 and GDC-0941 were selected to produce moderate singleagent activity in each model to visualize improvement of
efﬁcacy in the combination arms. For the A375 (BRAFV600E)
model, all tested doses of GDC-0973 showed regression and all
tested doses of GDC-0941 showed lack of TGI, however, the
combination of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 led to a greater
tumor response rate as GDC-0973 resulted in 70% (7/10)
complete responses (CR), whereas the combination resulted
in 100% (10/10) CRs. As a result, upon cessation of treatment,
tumors were slower to grow back in the combination arm
versus the GDC-0973 single-agent arm (Fig. 4A). In A2058 (Fig.
4B), DLD-1 (Fig. 4C), and NCI-H2122 (Fig. 4D), combination of
GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 resulted in stronger tumor suppression than either single agent alone in all models tested (summarized in Supplementary Table S3). These results show that
the combination activity observed in vitro translates into
increased combined antitumor efﬁcacy in vivo. Combination

Similar to in vitro combination results, the combination of
GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 showed increased efﬁcacy compared
with single-agent treatment in multiple human xenograft
tumor models (Fig. 4A–D). Four xenograft tumor models
harboring BRAF or KRAS mutations with or without alterations in PTEN or PIK3CA were evaluated for response to GDC0973 and GDC-0941 as single agents and in combination.

Figure 5. Transient treatment of GDC-0973 þ GDC-0941 results in apoptosis and prolonged accumulation of Bim. A, 888MEL cells were treated with
0.05 mmol/L GDC-0973 and 5 mmol/L GDC-0941 as single agents or in combination for 24 hours and then washed to remove the compounds. Lysates were
made at subsequent time points after washout (2 and 24 hours) and analyzed by immunoblotting. B, 888MEL cells were treated with a 1 EC50 concentration of
GDC-0973 and/or GDC-0941 for 24 hours or a 4 EC50 concentration for 4 hours prior to exchanging media to remove the compounds. Cells were analyzed at
the 24 hour time point for apoptosis by the Cell Death Detection ELISA assay. cl-PARP, cleaved PARP; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.

pharmacokinetic studies showed that there were no drug–drug
interactions that impacted the exposure of either compound
(E.F. Choo, submitted for publication).
Transient exposure to MEK and PI3K inhibitors results in
apoptosis
Given that exposure to GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 resulted in
apoptosis, we hypothesized that transient inactivation of MEK
and PI3K signaling could be sufﬁcient to elicit antitumor
efﬁcacy. To examine this possibility, 888MEL cells were pretreated with GDC-0973, GDC-0941, or both for 24 hours followed by washout of compounds and serial evaluation of
downstream markers over time (Fig. 5A). After treatment with
single agent GDC-0941, the proximal pathway markers p-AKT
and pS6 were strongly inhibited but rapidly returned to baseline levels within 2 hours following washout. Treatment with
single agent GDC-0973 resulted in a strong decrease of p-ERK
that only partially rebounded after washout. Transient treatment with the combination had identical effects on p-ERK,
p-AKT, and pS6 as the single agents. However, there was a
combined enhancement of Bim protein accumulation and
cleaved PARP. Bim protein levels were modestly increased
above baseline in response to single agent GDC-0973 and were
maintained for 24 hours after compound washout. This
increase was more pronounced in response to combination
treatment. Cleaved PARP was modestly induced in response to
single-agent treatment with GDC-0973 or GDC-0941. It was
more strongly increased in response to the combination,
although it did not persist through 24 hours after washout.
This is perhaps due to detachment of late apoptotic cells from
the plates during repeated wash cycles.
To conﬁrm the functional consequences of transient exposure to GDC-0973 and GDC-0941, cell death was assessed by a
nucleosomal ELISA apoptosis assay. Transient treatment of
888MEL cells with either single agent GDC-0973 or GDC-0941
resulted in minimal to no apoptosis induction, whereas GDC0973 plus GDC-0941 resulted in a 5-fold increase in apoptosis
(Fig. 5B). A comparable extent of apoptosis was observed for

216

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

cells that were exposed to either a low concentration of the
inhibitors for 24 hours or a high concentration for 4 hours.
Effects of transient combination treatment on cell proliferation were also observed (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). To
conﬁrm these results in vivo, mice bearing A2058 xenograft
tumors were dosed daily with GDC-0941 and GDC-0973 for 4
days, and then tumors were excised and analyzed serially after
the last dose. As expected, pS6 levels returned to baseline by 8
hours after the ﬁnal dose (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Taken
together, these results show that continuous pathway suppression is not necessary to elicit sustained effects on proliferation and apoptosis.
Intermittent dosing of MEK and PI3K inhibitors is
efﬁcacious in vivo
The cell washout studies producing apoptosis suggested
that continuous exposure to the combination of GDC-0973 and
GDC-0941 is not required for efﬁcacy. This was tested in the
A375.X1, A2058, DLD-1, and NCI-H2122 xenograft tumor models by dosing both GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 on an every third
day intermittent schedule (Fig. 6A–D). Each tumor model
varied in its sensitivity to the 2 compounds, and doses were
chosen to produce modest single-agent activity. When both
drugs were dosed intermittently on an every third day regimen
increased TGI was observed in response to the combination in
all 4 models. While all the models showed some degree of
improvement of efﬁcacy in combination, tumor inhibition of
the combination differed most from single-agent activity in the
DLD-1 colon cancer xenograft model, which carries mutations
in both KRAS and PIK3CA.
Pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in the A2058
xenograft model to assess the response of downstream
markers to intermittent dosing with GDC-0973 and GDC0941. Brieﬂy, both GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 were administered intermittently every third day for a total of 2 doses at
15 and 150 mg/kg, respectively. Tumors were harvested at 8
and 72 hours following the second dose and analyzed by
Western blotting for various downstream pathway markers.

GDC-0941 (blue circles and lines), or a combination (Combo) of the 2 drugs (green diamonds and lines) were dosed orally, every third day (Q3D) for 21
consecutive days at the indicated doses labeled in the panels. Percentage of TGI is listed in Supplementary Table S3. Tumor PD studies were conducted in the
A2058 xenograft tumor model at 8 hours (E) and 72 hours (F) post last dose. Brieﬂy, tumor-bearing mice were treated for a total of 2 doses of GDC-0973 and
GDC-0941 at 15 and 150 mg/kg, respectively, both given Q3D. Multiple downstream response markers were assessed by Western blotting.

At 8 hours post last dose, intermittent GDC-0973 treatment
resulted in robust suppression of p-ERK, a mild decrease in
cyclin D1 levels, and an increase in BimS and BimL levels
(Fig. 6E). GDC-0941 treatment resulted in suppression of pAKT with a modest decrease in phospho-S6 levels, as well as
a slight increase in BimS and BimL levels (Fig. 6E). Combination treatment resulted in a more pronounced decrease in
cyclin D1 levels at 8 hours as well as a stronger induction of
BimS levels (Fig. 6E). Mobility of the BimS, BimL, and BimEL
isoforms was increased, consistent with a more stable and
dephosphorylated form of Bim (Fig. 3B; refs. 22, 23). At 72
hours post last dose, p-ERK, p-AKT, and pS6 levels had
returned to baseline levels in both single agent and combination-treated tumors (Fig. 6F). However, cyclin D1 levels
remained lower and Bim levels remained slightly elevated in
response to combination treatment. This is consistent with
intermittent pathway knockdown resulting in more sus-

tained effects on downstream markers of proliferation and
apoptosis.
Similar intermittent efﬁcacy was observed using a different
PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0980, when dosed daily or once a week in
combination with GDC-0973 (Supplementary Fig. S8A and
S8B). Combination efﬁcacy has also been published with a
different MEK inhibitor, PD0325901, when dosed intermittently with GDC-0941 (15). Therefore, intermittent efﬁcacy with
MEK and PI3K inhibitors has observed with multiple
inhibitors.

Discussion
In the past several years, there have been numerous studies
published on combinations of targeted agents in preclinical
cancer models, and more recently, combinations of novel
targeted agents have begun to be tested in the clinic

Hoeﬂich et al.

(24, 25). For inhibitors of the PI3K and MEK pathways, there are
currently more than half a dozen phase Ib combination trials in
progress combining selective targeted agents against nodes in
these pathways (26–29). There are many important questions
to be addressed including which nodes in the pathways will be
most efﬁcacious and best tolerated in combination, identifying
which patients will be most likely to beneﬁt from a particular
combination, and which doses and schedules will be optimal
for efﬁcacy and tolerability.
Dose and schedule selection can be affected by both the
pharmacokinetic proﬁle and in vivo mechanism of combination activity of the 2 agents. For the selective MEK inhibitor
GDC-0973 and class I PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941, the mechanism
of combination activity was shown to be synergistic regulation
of cap-dependent translation (pS6, p4E-BP1), cell-cycle progression (cyclin D1, p27Kip1), and cellular apoptosis (Figs. 3
and 5; ref. 30). MEK/PI3K-dependent apoptosis was showed by
increased cleavage of PARP and mediated at least in part
through increased levels of the proapoptotic Bim protein.
Complete rescue of apoptosis was not observed in Bim lossof-function experiments and this may be due to additional
MEK and PI3K effectors that also contribute to survival
signaling by these pathways (30–32).
Given that the effects on knock-down of downstream
markers have typically been evaluated in cells under constant exposure to compound (33, 34), we tested how transient exposure to GDC-0973 plus GDC-0941 would affect the
time course of downstream pathway inhibition and recovery.
Whereas the majority of pathway markers returned to
baseline levels within 2 hours after removal of the compounds, Bim remained elevated up through 24 hours after
compound removal, showing a sustained elevation of apoptotic activity.
These ﬁndings translated in vivo, where pharmacodynamic
data show that pS6 levels in tumors returned to baseline by 8 to
24 hours after dosing with GDC-0973 þ GDC-0941, indicating
recovery of MAPK and PI3K pathway signaling at efﬁcacious
doses. Previous data have shown a similar time course for

recovery of the p-AKT signaling pathway after treatment with
GDC-0941 (33). The fact that the every 3 day schedule is
efﬁcacious suggests that continuous pathway knock-down is
not required for TGI, as the compounds are cleared from the
system and proximal pathway signaling returned to normal for
more than 24 hours prior to the next dose.
The every 3 day schedule used in these studies is a proof of
concept that intermittent dosing can be efﬁcacious and is not
suggestive that this is the optimal schedule to be used preclinically or clinically. Several factors will affect the optimal
dose and schedule of a combination in the clinic (35). After
gaining understanding of the mechanism of combination
efﬁcacy, the half-life of each of the compounds must be
considered, which differ substantially between mice and
humans. The schedule may also be affected by tolerability,
thereby affecting the therapeutic index. The pharmacokinetic
drivers of efﬁcacy and toxicity may be different and are being
assessed by MEK and PI3K pathway inhibitor combination
trials, including GDC-0973 and GDC-0941. With efﬁcacy in
BRAF and KRAS mutant preclinical models achieved with both
continuous and intermittent schedules, it generates multiple
paths for clinical investigation.
