BACKGROUND: Patients irradiated for brain tumors often suffer from cerebral edema and are usually treated with
dexamethasone, which has various side effects. To investigate the activity of Boswellia serrata (BS) in radiotherapyrelated edema, we conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot trial. METHODS:
Forty-four patients with primary or secondary malignant cerebral tumors were randomly assigned to radiotherapy
plus either BS 4200 mg/day or placebo. The volume of cerebral edema in the T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence was analyzed as a primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, cognitive function, quality of life, and the need for antiedematous (dexamethasone) medication. Blood samples were taken to analyze the
serum concentration of boswellic acids (AKBA and KBA). RESULTS: Compared with baseline and if measured immediately after the end of radiotherapy and BS/placebo treatment, a reduction of cerebral edema of >75% was found in
60% of patients receiving BS and in 26% of patients receiving placebo (P ¼ .023). These findings may be based on an
additional antitumor effect. There were no severe adverse events in either group. In the BS group, 6 patients reported
minor gastrointestinal discomfort. BS did not have a significant impact on quality of life or cognitive function. The
dexamethasone dose during radiotherapy in both groups was not statistically different. Boswellic acids could be
detected in patients’ serum. CONCLUSIONS: BS significantly reduced cerebral edema measured by MRI in the study
population. BS could potentially be steroid-sparing for patients receiving brain irradiation. Our findings will need to

Boswellia serrata (BS) is an extract of Indian frankincense. There are very few published data about the effects of BS in brain
edema and brain tumors. The most promising study came from Streffer et al,1 who investigated the use of the BS preparation H15 in 12 patients with cerebral edema and demonstrated a clinical or radiological response in 8 of 12 patients.
Boeker and Winking2 had similar results in a small prospective study. In a systematic review, Ernst3 found 7 controlled
clinical trials investigating the anti-inflammatory effects of BS. These studies were related to the treatment of asthma,
rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, collagenous colitis, and osteoarthritis. No serious safety issues were raised in any of
the published BS trials. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to investigate the efficacy of
BS on cerebral edema in patients irradiated for brain tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
A total of 44 patients were enrolled in the trial. Demographic, tumor, and radiotherapy data are depicted in Table 1. The
2 randomly assigned groups were well balanced. The CONSORT flow chart for the study is given in Figure 1. All patients
received whole brain radiotherapy or partial brain radiotherapy to more than 60% of brain volume. Whole
brain radiotherapy was planned by 2-dimensional x-ray simulation, whereas partial brain radiotherapy was 3-dimensional

computed tomography planned (Oncentra MasterPlan,
Nucletron, Veenendaal, The Netherlands). Radiotherapy
was delivered by a 6MeV linear accelerator (Varian
Clinac 600C).
Study Design
In Germany, H15 (the Boswellia preparation used for the
current study) is sold as a dietary supplement. Because
H15 has no reported adverse effects, a classical phase 1
dose escalation study to find a maximum tolerated dose
was deemed unnecessary, and we decided to conduct a
pilot trial. A double-blind, randomized design was
selected to obtain data reflecting the smallest bias possible.
The study did not change the well-established radiotherapy for brain tumors in any way, and it did not pose an
extra risk for the patients.
All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study. The study was approved by the ethics
committee of the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg and
was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion criteria were (1) primary brain tumor or brain
metastases; (2) radiotherapy of whole or part of the brain
(>60% of brain irradiated) with a dose of 30-60 Gy in a
fractionation of 5  1.8-3.0 Gy/week; (3) no former

radiotherapy in the brain; (4) age >18 years; and (5) written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were (1) Karnofsky index <50; (2) pregnancy; (3) dexamethasone >24
mg/day before radiotherapy; and (4) lack of adequate
physical/psychological condition to provide written
informed consent.
BS and Placebo
After careful advice from pharmacists considering contents, standardization, and availability, the BS product
H15 (350 mg; Hecht Pharma, Stinstedt, Germany) was
selected for use in the study. H15 does not contain any
other ingredients apart from BS. The capsules were
bought by the pharmacy of the University Hospital Freiburg. Lot numbers of the product were exactly listed. The
manufacturer was not informed about the trial.
After consulting with a pharmacologist, the dosage
in the active treatment group was set at 4200 mg/day
(34 capsules/day), primarily because of potential difficulties associated with swallowing a large number of capsules. Because BS is available as a dietary supplement and
no considerable adverse effects have been reported, there
was no defined maximum dose. It is noteworthy that
Boeker and Winking2 reported better results with 3600
mg BS extract than with 2400 mg and reported no effects
with 1200 mg.
Placebo capsules contained the excipient lactose.
Blinding and Randomization
Randomization was performed by a pharmacist using a
computer-generated randomization schedule over 48
treatment numbers. Allocation was performed using balanced blocks of 4 distributing BS/placebo 1:1. A consecutive treatment number was allocated to the individuals
included in the trial.
For blinding, H15 capsules were sealed in another
capsule in the pharmacy. Using these double-layer capsules, the characteristic smell of BS could not be perceived.
Placebo capsules containing lactose were produced with
the same coating. Supply for 1 week was transferred into
plastic boxes, which were labeled with the individual
patient treatment number.
The BS/placebo capsules were delivered to the
Department of Radiation Oncology at University Hospital Freiburg. For security reasons, envelopes for emergency decoding were also transferred to blinded staff. The
randomization code was kept in the pharmacy until the
study ended and the database was closed. No emergency
envelope was opened. This procedure ensured that all

patients and staff were blinded. Additionally, the primary
endpoint was rated by an independent neuroradiologist
who did not know the patients and only disposed of the
magnetic resonance images.
Study Course
After providing written informed consent, patients
received the BS/placebo in consecutive order following
the randomization list in a box containing 84 capsules for
1 week (34 capsules/day starting with the first day of
radiotherapy). Baseline examinations and weekly study
visits (physical examination, EORTC-QLQ 30, minimental state, Common Toxicity Criteria [CTC], dexamethasone medication) were performed by a physician.
On every study visit, each patient returned the empty box
and received the BS/placebo for the next week. After considering the clinical status of each patient, the necessary
dexamethasone dose was defined. At the end of radiother-

3790

apy, BS/placebo was discontinued. The first follow-up
visit occurred 4 weeks after the end of radiotherapy.
Study Endpoints
The primary study endpoint was cerebral edema volume
on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after
therapy compared with volume at baseline (ie, before the
start of radiotherapy). Edema volume (cm3) was calculated by multiplying the edema extent in 3 directions (x,
y, z). Midline shift and size of ventricles were also measured. MRI imaging was performed at 3 time points:
before the start of therapy, at the end of therapy, and 4
weeks after the end of radiotherapy (plus BS/placebo).
The secondary endpoints of the study were dexamethasone medication (mg/week), toxicity (RTOG/
EORTC-CTC score), quality of life (average functioning
scales of the EORTC-QLQ 30), cognitive functioning
(mini-mental state examination), and progression-free

survival. In addition, serum levels of boswellic acids were
measured via high-performance liquid chromatography
combined with mass spectrometry.
Dexamethasone dose was determined by each
patient’s clinical situation before and during therapy. The
dose was increased when symptoms of intracranial pressure occurred; it was decreased when the patient was
asymptomatic. Because the study was a double-blind one,
the physicians responsible for the dexamethasone dose did
not introduce a bias. Dexamethasone doses were given as
median and range, because the mean values were biased
by single outliers. Data about the duration of steroid therapy prior to beginning radiotherapy were not collected.
Serum Levels of BS
Serum levels of boswellic acids have been shown to reach a
peak 1-2 hours after oral ingestion and plateau 2 hours
later.4 The specified pharmacokinetic profile was verified
in a test with a male subject; after oral ingestion of 1750
mg BS (H15), serum levels of the boswellic acids AKBA
and KBA were measured hourly for 6 hours. This test
proved that it was possible to take patients’ blood samples
during the plateau phase at any time of the day.
Extracts from different Boswellia species consist of
different boswellic acid compounds.5 The BS preparation
used (H15) is known to contain AKBA and KBA in relevant concentrations.6 In the test subject, KBA serum levels
up to 34.23 ng/mL were found. AKBA was found in low
serum concentrations, with a maximum of 2.83 ng/mL
and a minimum of 1.16 ng/mL, which is near the detection limit. AKBA could not be shown in the study
patients’ serum. This may be due to concentrations below
the detection limit of 1 ng/mL.
Measurement of boswellic acid concentrations was
performed in the Central Laboratory of German Pharmacists (Eschborn, Germany). The blood samples were centrifuged, and the serum was frozen at 80 C
immediately. The high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method for analysis has
been published elsewhere.4
Statistics
In addition to descriptive statistics, the Wilcoxon rank
test (BS group versus placebo group) for significance (P <
.05) was performed. For 2-sided testing, a power of 80%
and a ¼ 0.05 a sample size of n ¼ 19 for each group was
calculated and rounded up to n ¼ 20 per group. For better
demonstration of the results, edema response was classified according to the following groups: (1) increase of

edema, >105% of baseline (5% error); (2) constant
edema, 75%-105% of baseline; (3) slight decrease of
edema, 25%-75% of baseline; (4) large decrease of edema,
<25% of baseline. The raw data were the basis for statistical testing.
Analysis of progression-free survival was performed
using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. For
data management and statistical calculations, Microsoft
Excel 2002, jmp 5.01 (SAS Institute), and Sigma Plot 8.0
(SPSS) were used.

RESULTS
MRI Measurements
At the end of radiotherapy and at the first follow-up visit
the relative changes of edema volume compared with
baseline were evaluated. At the end of radiotherapy, 60%
of patients who had received BS reached a decrease of
edema to <25% of baseline values or showed no edema at
all. In the placebo group, only 26% of patients reached
this optimal outcome (Figure 2). At that point, 13% of
BS group patients and 21% of placebo group patients had
an increase of edema volume to >105% of the baseline
value. At follow-up, 4 weeks after the end of therapy and

cancer (adenocarcinoma) are shown (a) at baseline, (b) after radiotherapy, and (c) at follow-up (4 weeks after radiotherapy).

after discontinuing BS or placebo, the changes of edema
volumes in both groups converged again (Figure 2).
The measured and calculated average volume of
edema at baseline was 188.4 mL (range, 0-617.3 mL) in
the placebo group and 159.3 mL (range, 0-506.2 mL) in
the BS group (P ¼ .86). During radiotherapy, these values
changed to 97.4 mL (range, 0-346.8 mL) in the placebo
group and 45.7 mL (range, 0-264.0 mL) in the BS group
(P ¼ .023). After 4 weeks of follow-up, the values were
83.3 mL (range, 0-352.7 mL) and 73.9 mL (range, 0413.1 mL), respectively.
Typical MRI pictures of a patient receiving BS are
shown in Figure 3. This patient did not need any dexamethasone while on radiotherapy.
Stratifying the patients into primary and secondary
brain tumors did not change the results. Due to low
patient numbers in the subgroups, stratified results were
not significant.
Because tumor response on radiotherapy may have a
remarkable effect on edema outcome, this endpoint was
investigated carefully. In the BS patients, tumor volume
(biggest lesion) changed from an average of 24.4 cm3
before radiotherapy to 2.9 cm3 after radiotherapy compared with 19.9 cm3 to 16.1 cm3 in the placebo group.
This difference was statistically significant (P ¼ .008). Tumor response was also evaluated according to Response
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). In the
placebo group, 18% of patients had progressive disease
(PD), 36% stable disease (SD), 36% partial response (PR)
and 10% complete response (CR). In the BS group, 0%
had PD, 62% had SD, 25% had PR, and 13% had CR.
To investigate whether the BS group was experiencing primary edema reduction or secondary edema reduction via a decrease in tumor volume, the ratio of T1-

3792

weighted MRI tumor volume and T2-weighted MRI
edema volume (T1/T2 ratio) was calculated. Before therapy, this ratio was 0.11 in the placebo group and 0.15 in
the BS group. After therapy, it was 0.15 in the placebo
group and 0.06 in the BS group. This may be a hint for
the edema reduction by BS depending on an additional
antitumor effect.
The MRI measurements of midline shift and the
size of ventricles correlated with edema size but did not
adduce significant results.
Use of Dexamethasone
In the placebo group as well as the BS group, the median
value of dexamethasone dose was 0 mg/wk before and
during therapy. The ranges before therapy were 0-84 mg/
wk in the placebo and 0-112 mg/wk in the BS group. The
ranges during therapy were 0-122 mg/wk in the placebo
group and 0-84 mg/wk in the BS group. These differences
were not statistically significant.
Adverse Effects
Common adverse effects of radiotherapy were the same in
the placebo and the BS group (dermatitis, alopecia).
Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (nausea,
vomiting, dizziness, epileptic seizures, and headache)
recorded by RTOG/EORTC-CTC score are shown in
Table 2. Two patients had grade 3 and 4 toxicity, both of
whom were in the placebo group (nausea grade 3 in 1
patient and epileptic seizure grade 4 in 1 patient). The
patient with the epileptic seizure had to discontinue radiotherapy and the study.
In 6 patients from the BS group, diarrhea grade 1-2
occurred compared with no patients from the placebo

with the BS group or placebo group.
Many patients had a significant problem swallowing
12 relatively large capsules of BS or placebo per day, but
most of the patients learned to cope with this problem.
One patient who had metastases from esophageal cancer
could not swallow the capsules. Two patients refused to
further swallow the capsules and discontinued the study
in the first treatment week.
Quality of Life and Mental Functioning
The median Karnofsky index of the BS and placebo
patients at baseline was 70 and 80, respectively. It did not
change remarkably during radiotherapy (80 and 70 at the
end of radiotherapy). After 4 weeks of follow-up the median Karnofsky index was 80 in both groups. All differences were not statistically significant.
Quality of life was measured using the EORTC
QLQ-30 questionnaire at baseline, after radiotherapy,
and after 4 weeks of follow-up. Using the functional scales
(physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning, and global health status), the patients in the placebo
and the BS group at baseline reached an average score of
55.9 and 54.3 points, respectively (maximum, 100
points). After radiotherapy and after 4 weeks of followup, the BS group scored slightly better, with 58.6 and
61.3 points, respectively, compared with 56.2 and 53.8
points in the placebo group. The differences were not statistically significant. All patients had a comparatively low
quality of life.
In addition to the EORTC-QLQ 30 questionnaire,
the patients underwent a mini-mental state test (MMT).
The average MMT score at baseline was 28 points in the
placebo group and 29 points in the BS group (maximum,
30 points). At the end of radiotherapy and after 4 weeks
of follow-up, the BS patients reached an average of 27 and
29 points, respectively, versus 28 and 26 points in the pla-

cebo group. The differences were not statistically
significant.
At baseline, 100% of EORTC-QLQ 30 and MMT
questionnaires in both groups were evaluable. After radiotherapy, 81% of the EORTC-QLQ 30 and 80% of the
MMT questionnaires were evaluable. After 4 weeks of follow-up, 55% of the EORTC-QLQ 30 and 55% of the
MMT questionnaires were evaluable. Missing questionnaires were due to patient noncompliance or death shortly
after therapy. This may bias the quality of life results.

Progression-Free Survival
Progression-free survival, which could be a parameter for
an antitumor effect of BS, did not differ between the 2
groups. This is shown by Kaplan-Meier plots in Figure 4

Original Article

(P ¼ .68; log-rank test, BS vs placebo). The median follow-up time was 250 days.
Boswellic Acid Serum Levels
To prove BS uptake in the patients, the serum levels of the
boswellic acids KBA and AKBA were measured. AKBA
could not be shown in any of the 48 examined samples
(concentration under the detection limit), and KBA was
not shown in any of the 24 placebo patient samples. In 19
of the 24 BS samples, an average concentration of 64.9
ng/mL (range, 5.12-153.49 ng/mL) KBA was seen. In
5 of the BS samples, no KBA was found. Two of these
samples came from patients who did not continue the
study later on; 3 samples came from patients whose
other samples were positive and who had difficulties with
medication compliance.
In the patient with the highest BS serum levels (5
samples, all positive with an average KBA concentration
of 123.1 ng/mL [range, 53.25-153.49 ng/mL]) one of the
largest edema reductions was observed. His edema volume
was reduced by more than 300 mL from baseline to the
time after radiotherapy.

DISCUSSION
In addition to spiritual use, Boswellia or frankincense has
been used as a medication for hundreds of years.7 In
recent years, mechanisms of action of boswellic acids have
been identified.8 Takada et al9 showed that AKBA can
potentiate apoptosis, inhibit invasion, and abolish osteoclastogenesis in different human cancer cell lines. The
mechanism of these actions was found to be a suppression
of nuclear factor jB (NF-jB) and NF-jB-regulated gene
expression. It was further shown that boswellic acids possess potent anti-inflammatory properties in vitro by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, human leukocyte elastase, and the
NF-jB pathway.10,11 Cathepsin G was identified as
another target of boswellic acids.11
In clinical research, positive effects of boswellic acids
in the treatment of inflammatory diseases could be
shown.3,12 There exist clinical trials about the use of boswellic acids in asthma,13 rheumatoid arthritis,14 Crohn
disease,15 collagenous colitis,16 and osteoarthritis of the
knee.17,18 To our knowledge, there exist only first clinical
observation results for the treatment of cerebral edema by
boswellic acids.1,2
In our study, patients taking BS extract had significantly less cerebral edema than patients taking placebo,

3794

whereas the median dexamethasone dosage was the same
in the BS and the placebo group.
As cerebral edema and its inflammatory processes
are major causes of morbidity in brain tumor patients the
treatment of these phenomena has always been of high
importance. The most effective medication for cerebral
edema patients is steroids, in most cases dexamethasone.
However, steroids have reasonable adverse effects as
immunosuppression, mental changes, or even Cushing
syndrome. Furthermore, there is evidence that dexamethasone influences cancer therapies through stabilization of
blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers and reduction of
tumor perfusion.19 Several years ago, it was shown that
the use of steroids influences vascular response to radiation20 and directly inhibits apoptosis in human malignant
glioma cells.21 However, in spite of strong efforts, an
adequate replacement medication for dexamethasone has
not been found yet. Boswellic acids could be the basis for
a new kind of anti-inflammatory and thus antiedema
medication with decreased adverse effects, the additional
induction of apoptosis, and no modulation of drug (and
radiation) sensitivity.19 In addition to the first clinical
results,1,2 our study may be a further step in this direction.
In this study, patients receiving BS showed a better
tumor response to radiotherapy. This was not a planned
endpoint, and therefore, it has to be considered carefully.
Nevertheless, this observation may be a hint to a cytotoxic
or radiosensibilizing effect of BS which will have to be
investigated in further studies with long-time BS medication. It also has to be determined whether the impact of
BS on cerebral edema may be caused by an antitumor
effect.
The prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind design of this study makes its results highly
reliable. Nevertheless, the study will have to be confirmed
by a phase 3 trial. In the design of such a study, some
weaknesses of the reported trial should be considered.
First, most of the patients had problems swallowing 12
large capsules a day; future trials should attempt to provide the boswellic acids in a more concentrated form.22
Another possibility could be the development of a BS
product with an isolated acting component and applicable
intravenously. Second, considering the excellent toxicity
profile of BS, a phase 3 study should use an even higher
dose, particularly if the BS product can be more highly
concentrated. Third, the food of the patients on study
should be closely observed. It was shown by Sterk et al23
that food intake can remarkably change the bioavailability
of boswellic acids. By adding fat to normal nutrition, the

serum levels of BS could be further increased. Fourth, the
measurement of quality of life should be better adapted to
the situation of brain tumor patients; neither the MMT
nor the EORTC QLQ 30 seems to be the best instrument
for quality of life measurements in this context. A further
study might use more individual instruments tested in
palliative care, such as the SEIQoL.24 Fifth, duration of
dexamethasone medication before the study should be
recorded, and an exact schedule for decreasing dexamethasone dose should be given. Finally, the effect of BS on the
tumor should be included as a study endpoint.
A future phase 3 trial should consider the most important points for a potential clinical benefit of BS: an
effect on cerebral edema with possible reduction of the
necessary dexamethasone dose and an antitumor effect. It
will have to be investigated whether both are reflected in
patients’ quality of life.
In our patients, BS significantly reduced cerebral
edema measured by MRI. There were no severe adverse
events concerning BS. The results of this study do not suggest the use of BS as a replacement of dexamethasone in
patients treated with brain irradiation; nevertheless, they
show that BS could allow for steroid sparing. The study
will have to be confirmed by further investigations.
