ABSTRACT:
Targeted delivery of IL-12 might turn this cytokine into a safer, more effective
cancer therapeutic. Here we describe a novel immunocytokine, NHS-IL12, consisting
of two molecules of IL-12 fused to a tumor necrosis-targeting human IgG1 (NHS76).
The addition of the human IgG1 moiety resulted in a longer plasma half-life of NHSIL12 than recombinant IL-12, and a selective targeting to murine tumors in vivo. Data
from both in vitro assays using human PBMCs and in vivo primate studies showed that
IFN-gamma production by immune cells is attenuated following treatment with the
immunocytokine, suggesting an improved toxicity profile than seen with recombinant
IL-12 alone. NHS-IL12 was superior to recombinant IL-12 when evaluated as an antitumor agent in three murine tumor models. Mechanistic studies utilizing immune cell
subset-depleting antibodies, flow cytometric methods, and in vitro cytotoxicity and
ELISA assays all indicated that the anti-tumor effects of NHS-IL12 were primarily
CD8+ T cell-dependent and likely IL-12-mediated. Combining NHS-IL12 treatment
with a cancer vaccine, radiation, or chemotherapy resulted in greater anti-tumor
effects than each individual therapy alone. These preclinical findings provide a
rationale for the clinical testing of this immunocytokine, both as a single agent and
in combination with vaccines, radiation and chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

(monokine induced by interferon gamma) [11, 12]. By
virtue of its potent abilities to stimulate cell-mediated
immunity and inhibit angiogenesis, exogenous IL-12
administration has long been considered a promising
anti-cancer treatment [13]. Early preclinical studies of
recombinant murine (mu) IL-12 reported dramatic, even
curative efficacy against syngeneic murine tumors of
various types [14, 15], paving the way for subsequent
clinical studies in human subjects. However, after over a
decade in early clinical development, documented cases
of severe toxicity [16] and generally low response rates
[17] to rIL-12 have stymied its clinical development. To
successfully exploit the therapeutic potential of IL-12
in the clinic, innovative approaches for improving its
tolerability are clearly required.
One strategy for improving the safety of

Interleukin-12
(IL-12)
is
a
pleiotropic
proinflammatory cytokine produced by activated dendritic
cells (DCs) that is a key mediator of the transition from
innate to adaptive immunity [1]. IL-12 promotes cellmediated immunity by inducing the differentiation of TH1
cells [2] and by increasing the proliferation [3, 4] and lytic
capacity [5-7] of cytotoxic T and NK cells. High levels
of IFN-gamma are produced by T cells and NK cells
in response to IL-12 [8], leading to enhanced antigenpresentation through paracrine upregulation of MHC class
I and class II expression [9, 10]. In addition, the IL-12–
induced release of IFN-gamma stimulates macrophages
to produce the anti-angiogenic chemokines CXCL10/
IP-10 (interferon-inducible protein 10) and CXCL9/Mig

proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-12, is
to direct their delivery to tumors via fusion to a tumortargeting antibody. Such antibody-cytokine fusion
proteins, or “immunocytokines,” have previously
demonstrated the ability to enhance anti-tumor immunity
in preclinical models [18]. To maximize immunocytokine
tolerability, the antibody selected as a vehicle must bind
specifically to an antigen uniquely found in tumors.
Antibodies directed against necrosis-associated antigens,
which are abundantly present in tumors but not in normal
tissues, offer an attractive delivery approach [19, 20]. The
ability of DNA/histone-binding antibodies to selectively
target to regions of tumor necrosis has been well studied
both preclinically and clinically [21]. Taking advantage of
this concept, a necrosis-targeted IL-12 immunocytokine,
called NHS-IL12, was engineered by genetically fusing
2 human IL-12 heterodimers to the C-termini of the
heavy chains of the NHS76 antibody. NHS76 is a fully
human, phage display-derived IgG1 antibody selected for
its specific ability to bind to necrotic regions and thereby
target to tumors in vivo [22].
Here we describe the in vivo pharmacokinetic
and tumor-targeting properties, anti-tumor activity, and
immunological mechanisms of action of NHS-IL12.
For murine studies, a surrogate immunocytokine, NHSmuIL12, was engineered which consists of the human
NHS76 antibody fused to 2 murine IL-12 heterodimers.
The use of a surrogate molecule was necessary because
human IL-12 lacks biological activity in the mouse [23]. To
study the full mechanistic potential of the molecule, several
syngeneic tumor models were used in immunocompetent
mice. The efficacy and immunomodulatory activity of
NHS-muIL12 were compared against administrations
of non-targeted recombinant muIL-12 (rMuIL-12). In
addition, the anti-tumor effects of NHS-muIL12 were
studied in combination with radiation, three approved
chemotherapeutic agents, and an experimental cancer
vaccine.

suggest that delivering IL-12 via the immunocytokine
might result in a better tolerated and safer therapeutic.

Pharmacokinetics and in vivo bioactivity of NHShuIL12 treatment in cynomolgus monkeys
In subsequent in vivo studies, single s.c. or i.v.
injections of human NHS-huIL12 (40 µg/kg) or rHuIL-12
(4 µg/kg) were administered to cynomolgus macaques (n
= 2/cohort) to examine both IFN-gamma serum levels as
well as comparative pharmacokinetics. Consistent with the
previous in vitro assays, administration of NHS-huIL12
induced much lower serum IFN-gamma levels than did
rHuIL-12 (Figure 1C). Pharmacokinetic analyses clearly
showed the sustained presence of plasma NHS-huIL12
levels when injected by either route (Figure 1D-E), as
compared with a single i.v. injection of 4 µg/kg rHuIL-12
(Figure 1F). NHS-huIL12 was well tolerated as evidenced
by (a) an absence of any measurable increase in body
temperature, (b) a minor reduction in platelet counts, and
(c) no significant injection site reactions. Immunogenicity
against the fully humanized NHS-huIL12 was observed in
these monkeys, with a preponderance of reactivity against
the Ig, rather than the IL-12 portion (data not shown).

In vivo tumor-targeting and efficacy of NHSmuIL12
In order to assess the tumor-targeting and anti-tumor
efficacy of NHS-IL12, a second molecule was constructed
that included the same human NHS76 antibody, but fused
with 2 murine IL-12 heterodimers (NHS-muIL12). That
immunocytokine also induced lower levels of IFN-gamma
than rMuIL-12 when added to human PBMCs in vitro
(Figure 2A). In vivo fluorescence imaging was used to
study the tumor-targeting characteristics of subcutaneously
(s.c.) administered NHS-muIL12 in mice bearing s.c. LLC
tumors. Localization of fluorescent-labeled NHS-muIL12
within tumors was compared against BC1-muIL12, a
human monoclonal antibody immunocytokine analogous
in structure to NHS-muIL12 but lacking a target antigen
in murine tumors [24, 25]. Following subcutaneous
delivery at a distal site, NHS-muIL12 accumulated
within tumors to a higher level than did BC1-muIL12
(Figure 2B). Quantitation of tumor accumulation of both
immunocytokines is shown in Supplemental Figure S1A,
also indicating some passive targeting mechanism of the
BC1-muIL12.
To visualize the subcellular localization of NHSmuIL12 in vivo, tumor-bearing mice were treated with
the molecule, the tumors were harvested and fixed, and
immunohistochemical detection was performed against the
NHS76 antibody (human IgG1). Strong, distinct staining
in the nuclei of tumor cells was observed (Figure 2C), in
agreement with the proposed DNA-binding mechanism

RESULTS
Comparative stimulation of IFN-gamma

human IL-12 (rHuIL-12) in vitro
Figure 1A shows a ribbon diagram that illustrates the
immunocytokine NHS-IL12, which consists of the tumor
necrosis-targeting NHS76 antibody fused to 2 molecules
of the human IL-12 heterodimer. In vitro studies using
PHA-stimulated human PBMCs (Figure 1B) or human
NK-92 cells (data not shown) revealed that IFN-gamma
production was severely attenuated following the addition
of the immunocytokine. Since IFN-gamma production has
been linked with rHuIL-12 toxicity [16], these findings

of the molecule. NHS-muIL12 is a large macromolecular
protein that cannot pass through intact cell membranes;
therefore, the intracellular penetration of the molecule
in vivo suggests a loss of cell membrane integrity (i.e., a
necrotic/apoptotic phenotype).
In comparative studies, NHS-muIL12 was
administered via the s.c. route, as this resulted in elevated
levels of tumor uptake but reduced levels of liver uptake
than the i.v. route (Supplemental Figure S1B). NHSmuIL12 (10µg, corresponding to a dose of 5.4µg of
murine IL-12 equivalents) demonstrated greater antitumor effects compared with rMuIL-12 (5.4µg) in 3
different syngeneic tumor models (Lewis lung carcinoma
(LLC); MC38 colon carcinoma; B16 melanoma) (2-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test, P < 0.050) (Figure
2D–F). Both molecules were tolerated equally well as
indicated by normal body weight gain (data not shown).

To study the anti-tumor response to NHS-muIL12
over a range of doses, C57BL/6 mice bearing s.c. MC38
tumors were treated with DPBS or a single subcutaneous
injection of 1 µg, 5 µg, 25 µg, or 50 µg NHS-muIL12.
The delay in tumor outgrowth (Figure 3A), improvement
in overall survival (Figure 3B), and reduction in tumor
burden (Figure 3C) were all dose-dependent. Differences
in overall survival between treatment groups were
statistically significant (log-rank test, P < 0.0001), and
tumor volumes on day 20 correlated with the dose of
NHS-muIL12 (linear trend test, P < 0.0001).

that an immune mechanism(s) was responsible for the antitumor effects seen in vivo. IL-12 is known to induce the
release of IFN-gamma, so it was not surprising that NHSmuIL12 induced a dose-dependent serum IFN-gamma
response in vivo (Figure 4A). In addition, NHS-muIL12
induced the in vivo maturation of splenic dendritic cells,
as determined by quantifying MHC class I expression
on DCs (Figure 4B). NHS-muIL12 also induced the in
vivo activation of splenic NK cells (Figure 4C), tumorinfiltrating NK cells (Figure 4D), and splenic CD8+ T
cells (Figure 4E) in MC38 tumor-bearing mice. Similar
results were seen in B16 tumor-bearing mice treated with
NHS-muIL12 (Supplemental Figure S3A–D). All of these
effects were dose-dependent, and NHS-muIL12 was
more effective at activating the immune response than an
equimolar dose of rMuIL-12 for all of these parameters
(Figure 4B–E and Supplemental Figure S3A–E). These
correlates of immune response and anti-tumor efficacy
might prove useful to monitor in NHS-IL12‒treated
patients.

With knowledge that the human NHS76 antibody
would elicit a xenogeneic immune response over time
(Supplemental Figure S2A-B), multiple daily dosing
regimens were evaluated. Mice bearing s.c. MC38
tumors were injected subcutaneously with DPBS or
NHS-muIL12 according to 1 of the following schedules:
a single injection of 5 µg or 25 µg NHS-muIL12, or 5
daily injections of 1 µg or 5 µg each. In this study, the
total dose of NHS-muIL12 given determined the delay
in tumor outgrowth (Figure 3D), overall survival (Figure
3E), and tumor burden (Figure 3F). However, fractionated
dosing did not appear to have a major advantage over
single dosing of NHS-muIL12 at either total dose level
(P > 0.05).

Immune correlates of NHS-muIL12 function
NHS-muIL12 did not slow the rate of MC38 tumor
cell growth directly in vitro (data not shown), suggesting

Figure 4: Immune activation markers correlate with increasing doses of NHS-muIL12. (A) C57BL/6 mice were injected

with a single dose of NHS-muIL12 within the range of 0.01–50 µg. For each dose level, 2 mice were injected and serum samples were
obtained 48 h later for IFN-gamma detection by ELISA. (B–E) MC38 tumor-bearing mice were randomized (n = 4 mice per group) and
treated with PBS (closed circle), 5.4 µg rMuIL-12 (closed square), 2 µg NHS-muIL12 (closed triangle), 5 µg NHS-muIL12 (closed inverted

muIL12 in this study had a durable tumor regression.
When rechallenged with MC38 tumor cells on the opposite
rear flank, tumor outgrowth was significantly delayed
compared to naïve controls (Figure 5C), indicating that
the previously treated mice had developed a systemic antitumor memory response.
Although CD8+ T cells were shown to contribute
to the anti-tumor effects of NHS-muIL12, the antigen
specificity of this CD8+ T-cell response was unclear. The
p15E endogenous retroviral antigen has previously been
shown to be a tumor rejection antigen for several murine
tumor models including MC38 [26], suggesting that this

To identify the effector cells responsible for the
anti-tumor activity of NHS-muIL12, MC38 tumor-bearing
mice were treated with NHS-muIL12 in the presence or
absence of immune cell subset-depleting antibodies. The
in vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ cells,
resulted in a substantial loss of the antitumor efficacy
following the administration of NHS-muIL12 (Figure
5A−B). Depletion of NK cells also appeared to abrogate
the antitumor efficacy of NHS-muIL12, but this effect was
not statistically significant. Four mice treated with NHS-

rechallenged 4 months later with 300,000 MC38 cells on the opposite rear flank (open square). Five naïve C57BL/6 mice were challenged
with MC38 tumors in the same way (closed circle) (t-test; *, P < 0.05). Error bars in panels A and C indicate SEM. (D) MC38 tumor-bearing
mice were randomized and treated with PBS, 5.4 µg rMuIL-12, 2 µg NHS-muIL12, 5 µg NHS-muIL12, or 10 µg NHS-muIL12. Five days
after treatment, splenocytes from 4 mice per treatment group were pooled and stimulated for 6 days in vitro with 1 µg/ml p15E peptide.
ELISPOT assays were then used to determine the relative frequencies of splenic CD8+ T cells specific for p15E or ovalbumin. (E) The

assays detected a high frequency of p15E-specific T cells
in NHS-muIL12–treated mice bearing MC38 tumors
(Figure 5D), and similar results were observed in the B16
tumor model (Supplemental Figure S3E). In a separate
experiment, mice treated with NHS-muIL12 and cured of
their tumors were found to have a detectable p15E-specific

and to a lesser degree in C57BL/6 MUC1 transgenic
(Tg) mice (Figure 6A). This vaccine was then tested in
tumor models together with NHS-muIL12 to determine
their combined therapeutic potential. MUC1.Tg mice
bearing subcutaneous MC38/MUC1+ tumors were treated
with a single injection of cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg
intravenous (i.v.)) 1 day prior to treatment with NHSmuIL12 (10 µg s.c.) and tecemotide (100 µg peptide
s.c.). Three weekly booster vaccinations of tecemotide
were given following this priming vaccination. Mice
treated with the full combination of cyclophosphamide,
tecemotide, and NHS-muIL12 showed an increased delay
in tumor growth relative to untreated controls and mice
that received only 2 therapeutic agents (2-way ANOVA, P
< 0.001) (Figure 6B). An analogous study in the orthotopic
Panc02/MUC1+ tumor model gave similar results (2-way

pancreatic cancer and some other carcinomas [33]. Mice
bearing orthotopic Panc02 tumors were given 2 treatments
of 10 µg NHS-muIL12 (s.c.) plus 120 mg/kg gemcitabine
(i.v.) spaced 1 week apart. This treatment combination also
showed additive anti-tumor effects (Figure 7C) relative to
either monotherapy (2-way ANOVA, P < 0.050).
Docetaxel is an anti-mitotic taxane that can promote
tumor susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing [34]. Mice
bearing well-established s.c. MC38 tumors were treated
with docetaxel or NHS-muIL12 alone or in combination.
Docetaxel treatment of mice bearing ~150mm3 MC38
tumors slowed tumor growth, whereas NHS-muIL12
administration resulted in significant transient tumor
regression (Figure 8A). The combined administration of
docetaxel followed by NHS-muIL-12 was able to induce
the sustained regression of very large (~640mm3) MC38
tumors (Figure 8B).

Radiation treatment is known to induce some
immune-associated changes in tumor cells, including
upregulation of MHC class I molecules and diversification
of the intracellular antigenic peptide pool, resulting in
better anti-tumor immunity [29]. In mice bearing LLC
tumors, the combination of NHS-muIL12 with localized,
fractionated radiotherapy showed additive tumor growth
inhibition (Figure 7A) that was statistically significant
relative to either therapy given alone (2-way ANOVA, P
< 0.001). The therapeutic combination of radiation with
NHS-muIL12 in the MC38 s.c. tumor model showed
similar results (data not shown).
Sunitinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor
used to treat late-stage kidney cancer and gastrointestinal
stromal tumor [30] that has been shown to modulate
immune responses [31, 32]. The treatment combination
of sunitinib with NHS-muIL12 showed an additive

DISCUSSION

levels of IFN-gamma release by immune cells both in vitro
and in vivo than IL-12 alone. Furthermore, an NHS76murine IL-12 conjugate is able to target subcutaneous
tumors in vivo, and this immunocytokine is superior to an
equimolar dose of rMuIL-12 in delaying the growth of 3
different tumor models (LLC, MC38 and B16). The effects
of NHS-muIL12 on subcutaneous tumor growth were
dose-dependent over a 50-fold range, and NHS-muIL12
showed anti-tumor efficacy after a single injection. The
finding that NHS-muIL12 does not directly inhibit MC38
tumor cell growth in vitro, combined with the previously
reported immune-activating effects of IL-12, provided
evidence for the immune-mediated mechanisms by which
NHS-muIL12 affects tumor growth in vivo.
NHS-muIL12 was found to increase serum IFNgamma levels, upregulate MHC class I protein expression
on DCs, and induce the proliferation of CD49b+ NK cells
and CD8+ T cells, all in a dose-dependent manner. An
immune cell subset depletion study confirmed that the
anti-tumor effects of NHS-muIL12 require CD8+ cells
and may involve NK cells, consistent with the known
mechanisms of action of IL-12 [41]. Further investigations
into the antigen specificity of the CD8+ T-cell response
focused on the p15E endogenous retroviral tumor antigen.
ELISPOT analysis revealed that mice bearing MC38 or

Interleukin-12 is clearly capable of eliciting
substantial immunotherapeutic effects in various
preclinical studies, but its clinical potential has yet to be
successfully translated [35-38]. Developing new IL-12
delivery systems to maximize cytokine levels directly
in the tumor microenvironment may be a safer and more
effective approach to treat cancer. In the present studies,
IL-12 has been engineered into an immunocytokine (NHSIL12) with tumor-targeting capabilities and tested for
efficacy. This selective targeting of NHS-IL12 is mediated
by the immunoglobulin portion of the molecule (NHS76)
that binds to DNA in necrotic tissue [22]. In both mouse
and human tumors, rapid tumor growth often outpaces
the development of blood vessels, leading to a lack of
adequate perfusion and subsequent necrosis. Necrosis
can expose intracellular antigens within the tumor
microenvironment, which presents an ideal opportunity for
the tumor-specific targeting of NHS-IL12. Other IL-12based immunocytokines have been engineered previously
[39,40], but the antibody portion of NHS-IL12 may give it
a unique potential to target a wider range of solid tumors.
Here we have shown that NHS76 fused to human
IL-12 has a longer half-life in vivo but induces lower

Figure 8: Docetaxel and NHS-muIL12 are effective as monotherapies and combined therapies in mice bearing wellestablished MC38 tumors. (A) Mice bearing well-established (~150 mm3) s.c. MC38 tumors were randomized (n = 12 mice per group)

and treated with saline (closed circle), 3x0.5 mg docetaxel (closed square) on days 11, 13 and 15 (blue arrows), or 1x50 µg NHS-muIL12
(closed triangle) on day 11 (red arrow) after tumor implantation. Docetaxel and NHS-muIL12 each significantly delayed tumor growth as
compared with saline-treated controls (1-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-test; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.0001). (B) To study the combined
efficacy of these therapeutic agents, mice bearing MC38 tumors were randomized (n = 12 mice per group) and treated with saline (closed

(red arrow), or the sequential combination of both (closed inverted triangle). Graphs show mean tumor volume ± SE over time for each

B16 tumors developed a stronger p15E-specific CTL
response following NHS-muIL12 treatment. Mice that
were cured of their MC38 tumors showed some resistance
to tumor rechallenge and displayed long-lasting p15Especific CTL memory. Thus fusing IL-12 to NHS76 does
not alter the fundamental immune-activating mechanisms
of the cytokine. The potential of NHS-muIL12 as an
effective immunotherapeutic agent is underscored by
the significant anti-tumor activity and CTL activation
observed following a single s.c. injection.
NHS-muIL12 is clearly more potent against murine
tumor models when directly compared with rMuIL-12.
This enhanced efficacy of NHS-muIL12 likely stems
from the more favorable pharmacokinetic properties of the
immunocytokine and its DNA-binding ability at necrotic
sites. Additionally, large macromolecules are known to
selectively accumulate in tumors through a passive process
termed the “enhanced permeabilization and retention
effect” [42], which may also apply to immunocytokines.
Tumor targeting of NHS-muIL12 may enhance the
activation of CD8+ T cells at the site of the tumor and also
prolong their cytotoxic effector function. The duration of
CD8+ T-cell exposure to IL-12 correlates with the overall
level of T-cell activation [43], and it is well known that
regulatory T cells (Tregs), macrophages, and other cells
found within tumors can be immunosuppressive [44].
The advantage gained by NHS-muIL12 administration
is an increase in intratumoral IL-12 concentration, which
seems to be biologically important to fully activate
tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and overcome this
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
In addition to increasing its therapeutic efficacy,
the biochemical properties of NHS-IL12 might mitigate
the toxicity that has been associated with rHuIL-12. In
vitro assays using IFN-gamma production to compare
functional potency revealed that NHS-huIL12 and NHSmuIL12 were only 5% as potent as molar equivalent
amounts of human and murine rIL-12, respectively.
Additionally, NHS-muIL12 was extremely well tolerated
even at very high doses throughout our studies in mice.
Relying on mice alone may not be appropriate for the
preclinical modeling of IL-12 toxicity and it is therefore
important to note that NHS-IL12 was also well tolerated
by monkeys. Injection of cynomolgus monkeys with 40
µg/kg was well tolerated as evidenced by the lack of fever
and any change in blood profiles. The immunogenicity
against NHS76 seen in mice and monkeys indicates that
only clinical trials can provide meaningful information on
the repeated administration of NHS-IL12.
Pharmacokinetic data in cynomolgus monkeys
and tissue distribution studies in mice indicate that
subcutaneous injection is the preferred route of
administration of NHS-IL12. The frequency of NHSIL12 dosing is another important point of consideration,
as it has been reported that clinical IL-12-related toxicity
is highly schedule-dependent [16]. We have shown here
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that bolus and fractionated dosing of NHS-muIL12 had
equivalent efficacy against MC38 tumors at 2 different
total dose levels. This finding indicates that less frequent
dosing in clinical studies of NHS-IL12 might reduce
toxicity without a loss of efficacy.
One might expect NHS-IL12 to provide additive
or synergistic effects when combined with other types
of cancer therapy. Many cancer vaccines that were
specifically designed to induce strong tumor-specific
T-cell responses are in development [45]. However,
effector T cells can still be inactivated upon entering
the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment [46].
Pairing a cancer vaccine with NHS-IL12 treatment might
allow for the vaccine-induced T cells to better infiltrate
the tumor and remain active by virtue of their exposure to
NHS-IL12. In 2 preclinical tumor models, the treatment
combination of NHS-muIL12 with the vaccine tecemotide
was found to delay tumor growth more effectively than
either therapy alone. Combining NHS-IL12 with radiation
or a chemotherapeutic agent is another attractive option
for clinical development. Radiation, docetaxel, sunitinib,
and gemcitabine treatment of tumor-bearing mice have all
shown favorable immune changes at the tumor site (i.e.,
antigen modulation, reduced Treg numbers, and support
of memory T-cell generation) [29, 34, 47, 48]. In addition
to their own anti-tumor mechanisms, these therapies could
enhance tumor necrosis and thereby increase the tumortargeting capacity of NHS-IL12. Pairing NHS-muIL12
with radiation, sunitinib, gemcitabine, and docetaxel
in the preclinical studies reported here showed additive
anti-tumor effects, indicating that each of these treatment
combinations might be worth investigating in the clinic.
A phase I clinical trial of NHS-IL12 in patients with
metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors has recently
been initiated to determine the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) and optimal biological dose (clinical trial
#NCT01417546). Once the MTD of NHS-IL12 is
identified, the studies reported here will provide the
rationale for phase II trials that combine NHS-IL12 with
other experimental or standard of care cancer therapies.

tecemotide containing 25 µg peptide at each of 4 sites (100
µg total peptide per dose).
Sunitinib powder was obtained as a free base from
Merck KGaA and dissolved to a working concentration
of 2 mg/ml. The pH was adjusted to 6.0 and the drug
was administered to mice orally at 20 mg/kg/day for 7
consecutive days.
Gemcitabine hydrochloride was obtained from Eli
Lilly, diluted in 0.9% saline to a concentration of 12mg/
ml, and injected i.v. into the tail vein at a dose of 120mg/
kg. Mice received 2 separate injections spaced 14 days
apart.
Docetaxel solution was obtained from Hospira,
diluted in 0.9% saline to a concentration of 5mg/ml, and
injected i.p. at a dose of 0.5mg/mouse. Mice received 3
separate injections spaced 2 days apart.

Adult female C57BL/6, Balb/c, and athymic mice
were purchased from NCI-Frederick and Charles River
Laboratories. Mice that express the human CEA gene
on the C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by
Dr. John Shively (City of Hope, Duarte, CA). C57BL/6
mice expressing the human MUC1 gene were a gift
from Dr. Sandra Gendler (Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale,
AZ) and used for tecemotide studies. All animals were
housed and maintained under pathogen-free conditions
in microisolator cages, and were 2–6 months old at the
start of each study. Animal care was in compliance with
the recommendations of The Guide for Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (National Research Council).
Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), B16, MC38, and
Renca cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. CEA-expressing
and MUC1-expressing MC38 cells were cultured in the
same media supplemented with 300 µg/ml G418. At the
start of each study, tumor cells were trypsinized, washed,
resuspended in HBSS, and then injected s.c. into the
right rear flank of each mouse. Mice were anesthetized
with ketamine (15 mg/kg) and xylazine (75 mg/kg) and
shaved on the rear flank prior to subcutaneous tumor cell
injection.

In vitro bioactivity assays
Freshly isolated normal human PBMCs were
incubated with phytohemagglutinin (2 µg/ml, PHA-P) for
4 days to promote the formation of blastoid cells. Human
IL-2 (R&D Systems) was then added for an additional day,
in order to upregulate the expression of the IL-12 receptor
on these cells. NHS-huIL12 and rHuIL-12 (R&D Systems)
were then added and supernatants were harvested 24 h
later. Secreted IFN-gamma levels were measured using an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Treatments

Cynomolgus monkey studies

NHS-huIL12 consists of the NHS76 DNAbinding antibody [22] fused to 2 molecules of the
human IL-12 heterodimer. NHS-muIL12 consists of
the same human NHS76 antibody fused to 2 molecules
of the murine IL-12 heterodimer. NHS-huIL12 was
produced by transient transfection of CHO-S cells, and
NHS-muIL12 and the control immunocytokine BC1muIL12 were produced by transient transfection of
HEK293. All three immunocytokines were purified by
Protein A chromatography. The antigen-binding and
IL-12 stimulatory functions of the fusion proteins were
characterized in vitro (data not shown) prior to the conduct
of in vivo studies. For anti-tumor efficacy studies, NHSmuIL12 or rMuIL-12 (R&D Systems) was injected s.c.
into the inner leg contralateral to the tumor.
Tecemotide is a liposomal vaccine encapsulating
monophosphoryl lipid A and a 25-mer peptide derived
from the human MUC1 tumor antigen [27, 28].
Lyophilized tecemotide was obtained from Merck
KGaA and resuspended in PBS prior to injection at a
concentration of 0.5 mg peptide/ml. To help overcome
immune tolerance to MUC1, mice were first injected
once i.v. with saline containing 2 mg cyclophosphamide
(Sigma) into the tail vein 1-3 days prior to the first
tecemotide vaccination. Mice were then shaved in the
abdominal area and injected s.c. with a weekly dose of

Cynomolgus macaques were treated with 40 µg/kg
NHS-huIL12 s.c., 40 µg/kg NHS-huIL12 i.v., or 4 µg/kg
rHuIL-12 i.v. (n = 2/group). Serum levels of IFN-gamma
were monitored for 5 days post-injection by ELISA. Drug
levels were monitored for 8 days post-injection by IL-12
ELISA.

Noninvasive in vivo imaging
NHS-muIL12 and BC1-muIL12 were conjugated
to Alexa Fluor 750 using the SAIVI Rapid Antibody
Labeling Kit (Invitrogen) and injected either s.c. or i.v.
into nude mice bearing Lewis lung tumors. Fluorescence
and photographic images of the tumor site were taken over
the course of 3 days using an IVIS 200 imaging system
(Caliper Life Sciences). Fluorescence at the site of the
tumor was analyzed using Living Image software (Caliper
Life Sciences).

slides. Following deparaffinization, the slides were
placed in an automated staining instrument (Ventana
Medical Systems). Slides were incubated with a primary
Ab (rabbit anti-huIgG1; Epitomics) for 8 h at room
temperature followed by incubation with a secondary Ab
(anti-rabbit IgG-HRP; OmniMap) for 16 minutes at 37˚C.
Chromogenic detection was made using ChromoMap
DAB substrate solution (Ventana). Counterstaining
was performed with Hematoxylin II (Ventana) and a
post-counterstain was performed using Bluing Reagent
(Ventana).

Serum cytokine quantification

Subcutaneous tumor growth studies

Single-cell suspensions prepared from spleens were
labeled with an antibody cocktail containing anti-mouseCD11c-PE-Cy7, anti-mouse-CD80-APC, anti-mouseCD86-PE, anti-mouse-H-2Kb-FITC, and anti-mouseI-Ab-Pacific Blue (all antibodies were purchased from
eBioscience). The mean fluorescence intensities (MFI)
of H-2Kb (MHC class I) and I-Ab (MHC class II) in the
CD11c+CD80highCD86high population were determined
using a BD LSR II flow cytometer and BD FACSDiva
software.

Mouse serum was obtained 48 h following s.c.
NHS-muIL12 treatment of non-tumor-bearing C57BL/6
mice. Murine IFN-gamma levels were determined using a
standard ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sample ODs at 450nm
were read using a Synergy HT plate reader (Bio-Tek).

MHC expression by dendritic cells

Mice were inoculated with LLC (5x105), B16
(5x10 ), MC38 (3-5x105), MC38/CEA+ (3x105), MC38/
MUC1+ (106), or Renca (106) tumor cells in the right rear
flank. Tumors became measurable 7-12 days later at which
time the mice were randomly assigned to experimental
groups and treatment was initiated. Tumors were measured
twice per week throughout the studies using calipers, and
the tumor volume was calculated as: Volume = (width)2 x
(length) x 0.5236. Mice were euthanized when the tumor
volume exceeded 1.5cm3.

In vivo lymphocyte proliferation

Orthotopic pancreatic tumor growth studies

Mice were administered 1mg of bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at 24 h, 16 h, and
1 h prior to harvest of tumors and spleens. Minced tumor
slurries were dissociated in media containing collagenase
IV (400 units/ml; Worthington) and DNase I (100 µg/
ml; Roche). Single-cell suspensions were prepared from
spleens and labeled with an antibody cocktail containing
anti-mouse CD45-PerCP-Cy5.5, anti-mouse CD8-Pacific
Blue, anti-mouse CD4-Alexa Fluor 750, and anti-mouse
CD49b-APC (eBioscience). Intracellular antibody staining
against BrdU was performed using a commercially
available kit (BD) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Data were acquired on a BD LSR II flow
cytometer and analyzed using FACS Diva software.

Previously frozen Panc02 or Panc02/MUC1+ tumor
fragments were surgically implanted onto the pancreases
of female C57BL/6 or MUC1.Tg mice. Twelve days later,
~2mm3 tumor fragments were prepared from these seed
tumors and implanted onto the pancreas of each mouse
on the study. Treatment was initiated 7 days after tumor
implant. To monitor tumor growth, mice were anesthetized
and tumor diameter was measured with calipers. Tumor
volume was calculated as: Volume = (4/3) x 3.14159 x
(Diameter/2)3. Mice were euthanized when the tumor
volume exceeded 2.0cm3.

Radiotherapy combination study

Immune cell subset depletions

Mice were inoculated into the right quadriceps
muscle with 5x105 LLC cells. Ten days after inoculation,
mice were sorted into treatment groups with mean tumor
volumes of ~135mm3. Tumor-bearing legs were irradiated
(360 cGy daily/5 days) by timed exposure to a 137Cs source
(GammaCell 40 Exactor); a lead collimator device was
used to localize delivery. Tumors were measured twice per
week throughout the study using calipers, and the tumor
volume was calculated as: Volume = (length) x (width) x
(height)/2. Mice were euthanized when the tumor volume
exceeded 2.0cm3.

To deplete CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell populations,
mice were given 4 daily i.p. injections of 100 µg GK1.5
or 2.43 antibodies, respectively, the week before tumor
implantation. Mice were then given additional weekly
i.p. injections throughout the study to maintain these
low T-cell levels. NK cells were depleted by injecting
mice once per week with 25µl rabbit anti-asialo-GM1
(Cedarlane Laboratories), beginning the week before
tumor cell injection and continuing through the end of the
study.

In vitro MUC1-specific CD4+ lymphocyte
proliferation assay

C57BL/6 mice (n = 4/group) received 2 s.c.
injections of NHS-muIL12 (10 µg) or PBS given 7
days apart. Plasma was collected 1 week after the last
administration. Antibodies against NHS-muIL12 were
detected using an ELISA method: 96-well immunoassay
plates (Nunc) were coated by incubation with 2 µg/ml
NHS-muIL12 in carbonate buffer overnight, followed
by blocking with 5% BSA. Plasma samples were
serially diluted in the assay plate and incubated for 1
h. Detection was made using a rabbit anti-mouse IgG1
antibody conjugated to horse-radish peroxidase (Jackson
ImmunoResearch) and TMB substrate (BioFX). A standard
curve ranging from 1.56 to 100ng/ml was prepared using
mouse IgG1 (Invitrogen). Sample ODs at 450 nm were
read using a SpectraMax 340PC plate reader (Molecular
Devices).

The 25-mer peptide used to produce tecemotide
(BP25, STAPPAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPP) was
synthesized and purified by CPC Scientific. Two weeks
after the final tecemotide booster vaccination, spleens
from naïve and vaccinated mice were harvested and
prepared as single cell suspensions. CD4+ splenocytes
were isolated using a Dynal CD4 cell negative isolation kit
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
These cells (2x105/well) were then co-incubated with
irradiated splenocytes (20 Gy, 106/well) from syngeneic
naïve mice and 3.1-100 μg/ml of BP25 peptide in flatbottom 96-well plates. After 4 days, [3H]-thymidine (1µCi/
well) was added to each well and incubated overnight. The
cells were harvested onto glass fiber filtermats using a
Tomtec Harvester 96, and 3H incorporation was measured
by liquid scintillation counting on a 1450 MicroBeta
counter (Perkin-Elmer). Each sample was run in triplicate,
and results were combined to yield a mean ± SE.

ELISPOT assay
Pooled splenocytes from each study group were
stimulated in vitro with 1 µg/ml of p15E peptide
(KSPWFTTL, H-2Kb). Six days later, CD8+ T cells
were isolated by magnetic-bead separation (Miltenyi)
and analyzed using an IFN-gamma ELISPOT kit (BD
Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
A total of 20,000 CD8+ T cells were co-incubated with
splenocytes pulsed with either p15E peptide or a negative
control OVA peptide (SIINFEKL, H-2Kb). As positive
controls, CD8+ T cells were stimulated with 1 µmol/L
of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 10 ng/mL of
ionomycin. Co-cultures were carried out in triplicate.
Spot counts were analyzed using an ELISPOT plate reader
(Immunospot).

Statistical analysis
For subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor growth
studies, the tumor volume over time was plotted as mean
± SE. Survival comparisons between treatment groups
were made using Kaplan-Meier plots and analyzed with
the log-rank test. To analyze the differences in mean tumor
volume between treatment groups, the latest time point at
which all mice remained alive was selected for 1-way or
2-way ANOVA analysis followed by an appropriate posttest. The student’s t-test was used to analyze a study with
only 2 treatment groups. Analyses were carried out using
the GraphPad Prism software package (Prism 5 for Mac
OS X, version 5.0d, GraphPad Software, Inc.). Statistical
significance was accepted if P < 0.05.

CTL assay
A CD8+ T-cell functional assay was carried out using
RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1
mM nonessential amino acids, 15 mM Hepes buffer (pH
7.4), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin.
Splenocytes from mice that became tumor-free after NHSmuIL12 treatment were stimulated in vitro with 10 µg/ml
p15E peptide (KSPWFTTL, H-2Kb). After 6 days, these
cells were co-incubated in triplicate wells of round-bottom
96-well plates with 111In-labeled EL-4 cells pulsed with 10
µg/ml p15E peptide or a negative control VSV-NP peptide
(RGYVYQGL, H-2Kb). After overnight incubation, 111In
release was measured via gamma counter and cytotoxicity
was calculated as % specific lysis = [(experimental cpm spontaneous cpm) / (total cpm – spontaneous cpm)] x 100.
Results from triplicate wells were combined and reported
