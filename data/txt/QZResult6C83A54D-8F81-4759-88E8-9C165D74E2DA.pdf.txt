ABSTRACT
Metastatic spread of cancer cells portends a poor prognosis and mortality for lung
cancer patients. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) enhances tumor cell motility
by activating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is considered
a prerequisite for metastasis. Recent studies of microRNA involvement in cancer
invasion and metastasis have highlighted the role of such RNAs in tumor development.
However, little work has been done to identify tumor suppressor microRNAs that
target HIF-1α to down-modulate the EMT and thereby counteract the aggressiveness
and metastasis of lung cancer cells. Here, we identiﬁed the 3′-untranslated region of
HIF-1α mRNA as a target of miR-622 and established that miR-622-mediated downmodulation of HIF-1α correlates with decreased levels of mesenchymal proteins,
including Snail, β-catenin, and vimentin. Functional analyses revealed that increased
miR-622 expression inhibited lung cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. miR-622
also inhibited the genesis of metastatic lung nodules as demonstrated in a lung cancer
xenograft model in which nude mice were transplanted with A549 cells expressing
miR-622. Mechanistic analyses showed that overexpression of EGF decreased the miR622 level in A549 cells, and this reduction could be rescued by administrating U0126,
an inhibitor of ERK. Moreover, miR-622 overexpression mediated by the transcription
factor FOXO3a decreased the invasiveness of lung tumor cells by inhibiting HIF-1α via
inactivation of ERK signaling in U0126-treated A549 cells. These ﬁndings highlight the
pivotal role of the FOXO3a/miR-622 axis in inhibiting HIF-1α to interfere with tumor
metastasis, and this information may contribute to development of novel therapeutic
strategies for treating aggressive lung cancer.

increased tumor-speciﬁc angiogenesis, which is required
to resolve hypoxia in tumor microenvironments, promote
tumor expansion [1]. Studies have clearly demonstrated
that hypoxia itself enhances pro-survival mechanisms

HIF-1 [2]. HIF-1α is essential for enabling angiogenesis
and metastasis in a variety of solid cancers including
lung cancer [3, 4]. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), which can be induced by hypoxia [5],
is considered to be a prerequisite for the typical tumor
phenotypes of upregulated angiogenesis, enhanced cell
motility, and extracellular matrix invasion. Regulation of
the mesenchyme-speciﬁc transcription factor gene Snail
(SNAI1), which is activated via the HIF-1α signaling
cascade, enhances expression of the mesenchymal markers
β-catenin and vimentin in hepatocellular carcinoma in
response to hypoxia [6–8]. Importantly, HIF-1α is a key
factor responsible for the transcriptional regulation of
genes that facilitate the stemness properties of cancer cells
and enhance their metastatic potential in leukemia and in
prostate and breast carcinomas [9]. Accumulating lines of
in vitro evidence indicate that HIF-1α is overexpressed
in tumors to induce VEGF expression via activation
of a signaling pathway downstream of the mitogenactivated protein kinase/extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway [10, 11]. Thus, HIF-1α
is an established target for the development of cancer
therapeutics.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding
regulatory RNAs averaging 22 nucleotides in length
that principally recognize target sequences of cognate
mRNAs via less-than-perfect complementarity with the
3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the mRNA, leading
to cleavage of the target mRNA or repression of its
translation [12, 13]. More than 30% of protein-coding
genes are predicted to be regulated by miRNAs based on
bioinformatic algorithms [14]. Intensive studies of lung
cancer using gene expression proﬁling to investigate
tumorigenesis and tumor progression have revealed that
miRNAs function as tumor suppressors by negatively
regulating oncogenes [15]. However, there has been
scant identiﬁcation of potent tumor suppressor miRNAs
that target HIF-1α to down-modulate EMT and thereby
counteract the aggressiveness and metastasis of lung
cancer cells. Moreover, there have been even fewer
attempts to retrieve critical molecular information
regarding metastatic lung tumor cell–speciﬁc miRNA
expression that may impact tumor progression. To address
this deﬁciency, we predicted that the 3′-UTR of HIF-1α
mRNA contains a sequence that directs miR-622-mediated
translational repression, and indeed we validated HIF-1α
mRNA as a target of miR-622. We thus used lentivirusmediated transduction to establish two stable clones of
the human lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299 that
express miR-622 to validate the ability of this miRNA
to suppress cancer cell motility both in vitro and in vivo.
We discovered a novel mechanism underlying miR-622mediated regulation of HIF-1α, which is activated by
the transcription factor FOXO3a. Our ﬁndings provide
invaluable clues on how FOXO3a-mediated miR-622

overexpression regulates lung cancer progression, and
this information may drive the optimization of the design
and evaluation of potential miRNA-based therapeutics for
metastatic lung cancer.

RESULTS
miR-622 represses HIF-1α expression by directly
targeting the 3′-UTR of HIF-1α mRNA
We used a combined computational prediction
algorithm approach, including use of the programs
miRBase (http://www.mirbase.org/), miRWalk (http://
www.umm.uni-heidelberg.de/apps/zmf/mirwalk/), and
TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/), to determine
whether miR-622 contains a sequence complementary to
the 3′-UTR sequence of HIF-1α (Figure 1A) on human
chromosome 14q23.2 (Figure 1B). Toward this end,
we used the pGL4.13-luciferase reporter to generate a
construct encoding the full-length 3′-UTR of HIF-1α
(wild-type HIF-1α 3′-UTR-luc) as well as a 3′-UTR/
Mutant-luc with a mismatched version of the miR-622
complementary sequence (Figure 1C). We found that
miR-622 signiﬁcantly reduced the luciferase activity of
the HIF-1α 3′-UTR-luc product by > 50%. Moreover,
this reduction in activity was restored in the presence of
the pGL4.13 reporter construct containing a mutation in
the 3′-UTR of HIF-1α (Figure 1D). Furthermore, HIF1α protein repression was more prominent in miR-622transfected A549 lung cancer cells compared with control
(Figure 1E). These results clearly demonstrated that miR622 decreases HIF-1α expression by directly binding the
3′-UTR of its mRNA.

miR-622 represses HIF-1α to inhibit invasiveness
of lung cancer cells
Tumor hypoxia induces EMT, which leads to
invasion and metastasis by repressing the expression
of the epithelial marker E-cadherin [16]. We therefore
examined the suppressive function of miR-622 in lung
cancer progression of two lung cancer cell lines in vitro.
As expected, the migration and invasion abilities of miR622-transfected A549 and H1299 lung cancer cells were
diminished by >50% compared with mock-transfected
controls (Figures 2A–2D and Supplementary Figure S1).
In addition, miR-622 overexpression in these two cell
lines reduced HIF-1α level, which resulted in decreased
levels of Snail, β-catenin, and vimentin and an increased
level of E-cadherin (Figures 2E and 2F).
To underscore the contribution of miR-622 to the
molecular mechanism that enables mesenchymal tumor
cells to regain a cobblestone-like epithelial phenotype to
inhibit cancer cell aggressiveness during the mesenchymalto-epithelial transition of lung cancer cells, we used a

miR-622 compared with control (Figure 3A). After the
third day of incubation, the proliferation rate of A549miR-622 cells was signiﬁcantly lower compared with
control (Figure 3B). Interestingly, A549 cells with the

increased miR-622 level underwent a morphological
change from elongated and spindle-like ﬁbroblasts to a
cobblestone-like epithelial phenotype (Figure 3C). These
data indicated that miR-622 overexpression in A549
cells altered cell morphology and diminished tumor cell
proliferation as a consequence of the repression of HIF 1α
expression. On the other hand, the decreased cancer cell
motility upon miR-622 overexpression was restored

miR-622, and vimentin level was restored to that of the
control (Figures 3D–3F). In parallel, results from HIF1α silencing experiments with two short hairpin RNAs
(shRNAs) targeting HIF-1α mRNA (shHIF-1α) revealed
dramatic decreases in the migration and invasion of lung
cancer cells (Figures 3G–3I), lending support to our theory
that miR-622 inhibits tumor motility via repression of
HIF-1α to down-modulate the EMT axis.

the miR-622 overexpression group (Figures 4A and 4B).
Mice were sacriﬁced and their lungs dissected to evaluate
tissue morphology by hematoxylin and eosin staining. We
found that mice injected with A549-pLKO/miR-622 cells
had only a few pulmonary metastatic nodules on average
and signiﬁcantly fewer than the number of nodules
formed in the control group (P < 0.001, Figure 4C).
The control mice had signiﬁcantly larger tumors and
more extensive neovascularization, and the metastatic
lung cancer tissues that lacked miR-622 overexpression
had intensive staining for HIF-1α as assessed with
immunohistochemistry (Figure 4D). This supported our
hypothesis of a suppressive function for miR-622 in lung
cancer metastasis in vivo.

miR-622 suppresses metastasis in a xenografttransplantation model of lung cancer
Because we found that miR-622 plays a critical
upstream mediator role in regulating lung cancer invasion
and migration and repressing HIF-1α expression in vitro
(Figure 2), we explored whether miR-622-associated
metastatic suppression occurs in vivo. To examine whether
miR-622 downregulates the HIF-1α axis with consequent
effects on tumor metastasis, we established a xenograft
model of human lung cancer cells in nude mice. In this
model, A549 cells containing pLKO (control) or pLKO/
miR-622 were injected into the tail vein (5 × 106 cells/
mouse). After 6 weeks, the average body weight in the
control group was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with

miR-622 is downregulated by ERK in lung
cancer
miRNA genes are frequently downregulated via
promoter hypermethylation in different types of solid
cancers [17–20]. We therefore examined whether the
observed reduction in miR-622 level in lung cancer cells
was ascribable to DNA hypermethylation. However, we
found no signiﬁcant change in miR-622 level in A549
cells treated with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Figure 5A).

Alternatively, evidence has shown that induction of
angiogenesis by HIF-1α in cancer cells is activated by
epidermal growth factor (EGF)/AKT/ERK signaling
during hypoxia [21], and our analysis of miR-622overexpressing cells revealed decreased HIF-1α-dependent
cell invasion. We therefore hypothesized that lung cancer
cell aggressiveness could be rescued by upregulating
EGF/AKT/ERK signaling to compensate for the miR622-mediated downregulation of HIF-1α. Support for our
hypothesis came from our observation that A549 cells
treated with 10% serum or EGF (20 nM) had a reduced
level of miR-622 (Figure 5C); this lower miR-622 level
led to invasiveness (Figure 5D) via increased HIF-1α
expression as a consequence of ERK phosphorylation in
the EGF-treated A549 cells (Figure 5B). This inhibitory
effect on miR-622 level was comparable to that of the
ERK inhibitor, U0126, and inactivation of phosphorylated
ERK in the lung cancer cells resulted in a higher miR-622
level in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5E). Notably,
monitoring phosphorylation of Akt at T308 has been
shown to improve the assessment of Akt activation and
revealed that Akt activation is a poor prognostic factor
for lung cancer [22], we thus examined the activation
of AKT in association with miR-622 expression level
during hypoxia; however, T308 of AKT kinase was not
phosphorylated in response to EGF treatment in A549 cells
(Figure 5B). In addition, although phosphorylation of ERK
reduced the miR-622 level, miR-622 level was not affected
by HIF-1α knockdown in A549 cells (Figure 5F). We
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

concluded that a block of EGF/ERK signaling may inhibit
lung cancer metastasis via miR-622-mediated repression
of the HIF-1α axis, which, as a consequence, precludes
feedback inhibition of miR-622 level by HIF-1α.

FOXO3a upregulates miR-622 level
Inhibition of FOXO proteins by ERK depends
on ERK phosphorylation that leads to ubiquitination of
FOXOs and their subsequent degradation in proteasomes
[23]. Based on bioinformatics, we found that the primary
miRNA transcript of miR-622 (pri-miR-622) is located
at chromosome 13q31.3, and an in silico analysis with
ALLGGEN_PROMO predicted three putative FOXO3abinding sites in the pri-miR-622 promoter region;
thus, we speculated that FOXO3a might regulate miR622 expression. To test this possibility, we designed a
FOXO3a knockdown experiment in combination with
altered pri-miR-622 promoter constructs. In the gene
encoding miR-622, three fragments upstream of the 5′UTR of miR-622 gene were ampliﬁed and cloned into the
vector pGL4.21-Basic-Luc; these were named (–845/+1)Luc, (–845/–376)-Luc, and (–376/+1)-Luc (Figure 6A,
upper panel). In the presence of U0126 (40 μM), A549
cells having either promoter construct (–845/+1)-Luc or
miR-622 (–376/+1)-Luc showed an approximate 2-fold
increase in luciferase activity compared with the negative
control (Figure 6A, lower panel). Additionally, chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays performed with an antibody

ERK activation downregulates the FOXO3amiR-622 axis to increase HIF-1α expression in
lung cancer cell invasion

against FOXO3a showed that FOXO3a binds the upstream
promoter region of the miR-622 gene in response to
ERK (Figure 6B). Further, because U0126-mediated
ERK inactivation in A549 cells stabilized endogenous
FOXO3a mRNA (Supplementary Figure S2A) and protein
(Supplementary Figure S2B), we designed a FOXO3a
knockdown experiment in U0126-treated A549 cells and
found that the effect of FOXO3a on miR-622 elevation
was abrogated by shFOXO3a (a FOXO3a-speciﬁc shRNA;
Figure 6C). Concomitantly, upon ERK inactivation, the
decreased level of HIF-1α in the miR-622-overexpressing
A549 cells was restored upon transfection with either
of two shFOXO3a constructs (Figure 6D), which also
resulted in enhanced tumor cell invasiveness compared
with control oligonucleotide-transfected cells (Figure 6E).
Taken together, our data suggested that the inhibitory
effect of FOXO3a-mediated miR-622 expression on the
decrease in invasion capacity of cancer cells is controlled
by suppressing ERK-HIF-1α signaling.

As shown in Figure 6, FOXO3a upregulates miR622 to repress HIF-1α expression via inactivation of
ERK phosphorylation, resulting in the inhibition of the
invasiveness of A549 cancer cells. Further, we utilized a
luciferase gene construct encoding the promoter region
of HIF-1α (pGL4.21 (–376/+1), shown in Figure 6A);
the resultant promoter activity values showed that the
normalized luciferase activity increased in shERK1/2treated cells compared with control shRNA cells. By
contrast, this increase in luciferase activity was reduced
by > 60% in shERK1/2-cells treated with shFOXO3a
(Figures 7A and 7B). In addition, we used chromatin
immunoprecipitation with an antibody against FOXO3a;
the DNA fragment was captured in A549 cells transfected
with shERK1/2, whereas this was not the case for cells

level in shFOXO3-treated cells was much lower than
that in shERK1/2-treated cells, indicating that miR-622
downregulation correlates with the ERK-FOXO3a axis.

cells was signiﬁcantly reduced upon shERK1/2 treatment
(Figure 7E). Moreover, this decrease in invasiveness of

role of the FOXO3a-miR-622 axis in repressing HIF1α expression to account for ERK activation and its

lung cancer cells (Figure 7E and 7F).

invasion and metastasis in different types of cancers,
including brain, esophageal, and gastric cancer [24–26],

remain unknown. In the hypoxic microenvironment of

solid tumors, HIF-1α expression in certain clones affords
a selective advantage through multiple mechanisms
that rely on angiogenesis and EMT, which ultimately
increases tumor aggressiveness. HIF-1α overexpression
in lung tumor cells is associated with increased invasion
capacity and metastasis, and HIF-1α serves as a biomarker
of poor prognosis in human lung cancer [27]. The most
prescient ﬁndings of the present study are that miR622 directly targets HIF-1α as assessed with three
algorithms and that the resultant repression of HIF-1α
inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion as assessed
in vitro in two lung tumor cell lines under hypoxia. Our
xenotransplantation study of the tumorigenicity of human
lung cancer cells in mice conﬁrmed that the number of
lung nodules was signiﬁcantly decreased in animals that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

received cells overexpressing miR-622, which facilitated
downregulation of HIF-1α level. These ﬁndings not only
describe a relationship between the miR-622-mediated
suppression of lung cancer metastasis (based on targeting
HIF-1α) but also delineate the mechanism underlying the
inhibitory effect of miR-622 on lung cancer progression
via repression of the transcription factor Snail, which is
responsible for the mesenchymal phenotype observed
during EMT.
Recent studies have shown that miRNA expression
in tissues is regulated by the methylation of DNA
sequences upstream of the corresponding miRNA gene
and that cancer cell DNA is frequently hypermethylated
compared with normal cells [28–30]. We conjectured that
this modiﬁcation could be involved in miR-622-mediated

silencing in lung cancer, and thus we investigated global
DNA methylation patterns of the miR-622 promoter
in A549 cells. Our results, however, showed that the
reduced level of miR-622 in lung cancer did not correlate
with DNA hypermethylation in the miR-622 promoter
sequence. In contrast, expression levels of certain miRNAs
are tightly regulated during the cellular response to
hypoxia in poorly differentiated solid tumors, and indeed
EGF acts as an inhibitor to decrease the levels of tumorsuppressor miRNAs [31–33]. Intriguingly, we found a
correlation between EGF treatment and miR-622 reduction
under hypoxia, which led to an elevated HIF-1α level
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and promoted tumor cell invasion (Figure 5). Hypoxia
upregulates the EGF receptor and prolongs the activation
of ERK and AKT signaling, which contributes to tumorrelated angiogenesis and tumorigenesis [23, 34, 35]. Our
present data show that, although treatment of A549 cells
with EGF did not activate the kinase AKT, it enhanced
the phosphorylation of ERK, which led to a decrease
in FOXO3a level. Notably, blocking ERK activation
with U0126 enhanced FOXO3a-mediated miR-622
transcription that resulted in inhibition of HIF-1α
expression in cancer cells, leading to decreased tumor
invasion and metastasis (Figure 8).

Figure 8: Schematic representation of FOXO3a-mediated overexpression of microRNA-622 suppresses tumor
metastasis by repressing HIF-1α in ERK-responsiveness of lung cancer. A blockade of EGF/ERK signaling enhances FOXO3a-

induced miR-622 transcription, which inhibits the HIF-1α-EMT axis and leads to diminished tumor invasion and metastasis in lung cancer.

Going beyond the current study of the inhibitory
effects of miR-622 on lung cancer progression owing
to HIF-1α reduction, our results suggest a mechanism
underlying down-modulation of HIF-1α by miR-622
that then inactivates EMT pathway genes, leading
to reduced levels of Snail, β-catenin, and vimentin.
In response to hypoxia, HIF-1α and a broad array of
its downstream targets are synthesized de novo as a
consequence of defects displayed by a variety of tumor
suppressors in concert with organ-speciﬁc cancer cell
invasion and migration. For example, deﬁciency of
von Hippel-Lindau function counters the degradation
of HIF-1α under normoxia [16, 36], and HIF-1α
represses the transcription of the E-cadherin gene,
contributing to EMT in von Hippel-Lindau-null renal
cell carcinomas [16, 37]. In brain and breast cancers,
HIF-1α overexpression increases angiogenesis by
upregulating the levels of VEGF, interleukin-8, and basic
ﬁbroblast growth factor [38]. Recent association studies
between miRNA markers and lung cancer development
have demonstrated that the miRNAs miR-18, miR199, and miR-519c can suppress HIF-1α expression
for the purpose of assessing cancer prognosis [39–41].
Therefore, it would be informative to validate additional
genetic factors, including miRNAs, that are involved
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in modulating HIF-1α level in collaboration with
mesenchymal markers to potentially help predict risk of
aggressive lung cancer.
MiRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate the expression
of hundreds of tumor-suppressor genes that control a wide
range of biological and physiological events, leading to
inhibition of tumorigenesis and cancer progression as well
as the promotion of tumor cell death in different cancer types
[42, 43]. To our knowledge, the present study is the ﬁrst to
suggest the potential prognostic signiﬁcance of FOXO3amediated miR-622 transcription that then downregulates
HIF-1α and decreases tumor aggressiveness in response
to EGF-activated ERK signaling in lung cancer. Our data
demonstrate a role for miR-622 in repressing metastasis via
inhibition of HIF-1α-related EMT signaling and thus suggest
that miR-622 could be utilized as a promising target for the
development of a lung cancer therapeutic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, virus generation, and infection
The lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco’s
44234

Oncotarget

modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Life Technologies)
containing 0.1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS, 2 mM
l-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin. For the incubation of cells under conditions
that mimic hypoxia, cells were treated with deferoxamine
mesylate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or
cultured at 37°C in a hypoxia chamber (1% O2, 5%
CO2, 94% N2 atmosphere). Cells were transfected using
Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
A549 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS.
Brieﬂy, 2 × 106 HEK293T (human embryonic kidney)
cells were cotransfected with 10 μg of the lentiviral vector
pLKO (control) or pLKO/miR-622, 9 μg of pCMV∆R8.91
(packaging plasmid), and 2.5 μg of pMDG (envelope
plasmid), which were purchased from the National
RNAi Core Facility at Academic Sinica, Taiwan. At 24
h post-transfection, virus-containing supernatants were
collected. Lentiviral infection was performed by adding
virus-containing supernatant to A549 cells (1 × 106) at
the desired multiplicity of infection in the presence of 8
ng/mL polybrene. After 48 h, stable transfectants were
selected under 5 μg/mL puromycin. miR-622 expression
was conﬁrmed by real-time PCR.

HIF-1α (Cell Signaling) and E-cadherin (cat. 610182, BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were also used. Proteins
separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a Hybond-C
Extra membrane (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK)
that was then subjected to western blotting with an
appropriate primary antibody. Anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used as the
secondary antibody for detection using an ECL western
blot detection system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), and
band intensities were quantiﬁed by densitometry (Digital
Protein DNA Imagineware, Huntington Station, NY).

Site-directed mutagenesis
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to
generate the mutant HIF-1α 3′-UTR sites of the luciferase
construct using complementary oligos (Figure 1).
Plasmids containing multiple point mutations within the
sites were generated using the QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis system (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA).
Different concentrations of expression plasmids were
transiently transfected into lung cancer cells (1 × 106)
using Transfast reagent (Thermo, Waltham, MA). After
48 h, the cells were harvested, and whole-cell extracts
were assayed in subsequent experiments.

Reverse transcription and real-time PCR

Dual luciferase reporter assay

Primers speciﬁc for miR-622 and random hexamers
(supplied with the TaqMan miRNA assay) were obtained
from Applied Biosystems. Real-time PCR was performed
using an Applied Biosystems 7000 Fast Real-time PCR
system with miR-622 primers and TaqMan Universal PCR
Master Mix and AmpErase UNG (uracil-N-glycosylase;
Applied Biosystems). Values represent the average of three
independent experiments, normalized to the endogenous
control gene RNU-6B.

The 3′-UTR sequence of human HIF-1α was cloned
into plasmid pGL4.13 (Promega Co., Madison, WI,
USA) to produce the recombinant vector pGL4.13/HIF1α 3′-UTR wt, which contains the ﬁreﬂy luciferase open
reading frame under the control of the SV40 promoter. The
mutated nucleotides are underlined, and the sequences of
the mismatch primers used to generate the different HIF1α 3′-UTR mutants are shown in Figure 1C. A549 cells
were cultured in 24-well plates and co-transfected with
100 ng of HIF-1α wild-type or mutated 3′-UTR construct
and pLKO (the negative control) or pLKO/miR-622. The
ﬁreﬂy luciferase/Renilla luciferase activity ratio of each
sample was measured in the dual-luciferase reporter assay
system (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA).

Cell proliferation assay
Lung cancer cells (2 × 103 cells) were cultured in
96-well ﬂat-bottomed microtiter plates supplemented with
DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C. Cell
viability was determined with the MTT (methyl thiazolyl
tetrazolium) assay (absorbance read at 570 nm), and cell
viability is expressed as a percentage of viability measured
for the relevant control cells.

Flow cytometry
Cells (5 × 105) were seeded onto 6-cm dishes and
cultured at 37°C for 24 h. The cell pellets were washed
twice with PBS and ﬁxed with 70% ethanol at 4°C for
30 min. After centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min, the cell
pellets were washed with PBS to remove any residual
ethanol. Finally, the cells were resuspended in 1 mL of
solution containing 0.5 mg/mL RNase A, 1% (w/v) Triton
X-100, and 40 μg/mL propidium iodide and incubated at
37°C for 30 min. The cells were ﬁltered through a 40μm nylon mesh before ﬂow cytometry analysis of cellcycle distribution using a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer
(BD Biosciences).

Western blotting
The detailed procedure for western blotting has been
described [44]. Western blotting used primary antibodies
(diluted 1:1000) against the following proteins: AKT
(sc-8312), phosphorylated AKT (sc-16646-R), ERK
(sc-94), phosphorylated ERK (sc-7383), and vimentin
(sc-6260); each antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Antibodies against
