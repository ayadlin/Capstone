Abstract
Prior work indicates that c-myc translation is up-regulated in
multiple myeloma cells. To test a role for interleukin (IL)-6 in
myc translation, we studied the IL-6–responsive ANBL-6 and
IL-6–autocrine U266 cell lines as well as primary patient
samples. IL-6 increased c-myc translation, which was resistant
to rapamycin, indicating a mechanism independent of
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and cap-dependent
translation. In contrast, the cytokine enhanced cap-independent translation via a stimulatory effect on the myc internal
ribosome entry site (IRES). As known IRES-trans–activating
factors (ITAF) were unaffected by IL-6, we used a yeast-threehybrid screen to identify novel ITAFs and identified hnRNP A1
(A1) as a mediator of the IL-6 effect. A1 specifically interacted
with the myc IRES in filter binding assays as well as EMSAs.
Treatment of myeloma cells with IL-6 induced serine
phosphorylation of A1 and increased its binding to the myc
IRES in vivo in myeloma cells. Primary patient samples also
showed binding between A1 and the IRES. RNA interference to
knock down hnRNP A1 prevented an IL-6 increase in myc
protein expression, myc IRES activity, and cell growth. These
data point to hnRNP A1 as a critical regulator of c-myc
translation and a potential therapeutic target in multiple
myeloma. [Cancer Res 2008;68(24):10215–22]

nism of protein expression when cap-dependent translation is
prevented or when leaders contain structural elements, which are
inhibitory to scanning ribosomes (9–11). Translation initiation is
then achieved via internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) in the
mRNA’s 5¶ untranslated region (UTR). The three dimensional IRES
structure directly or indirectly recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit
to the mRNA for translation initiation. Several IRES-associated
trans-acting factors (ITAF) are required for IRES activity. These
factors bind to RNA at sites in the 5¶UTR and induce
conformational changes, which facilitate recruitment of the
ribosome to the IRES. Several publications (7, 8) document a
myeloma-specific up-regulation of myc IRES function.
In this study, we tested whether the up-regulated myc translation
in MM cells could be further enhanced by the myeloma growth
factor, IL-6. As IL-6 is an important growth-promoting cytokine for
MM cells (12) and in MM patients (13), its ability to affect myc
expression could support a pathophysiologic relevance of myc
translation in this disease. In several MM cell line models as well as
primary patient samples, the tumor growth factor IL-6 was shown
to enhance IRES-dependent myc translation. In addition, this effect
on the myc IRES was mediated by a novel myc ITAF, hnRNP A1.
IL-6 induced serine phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 and significantly
enhanced its binding to the myc IRES. Thus, RNP A1 is an
important regulator of MM myc expression and MM tumor cell
expansion.

Introduction
The c-myc gene encodes a transcription factor that is a key
regulator of proliferation (1). Dysregulated myc expression plays a
role in Burkitt’s lymphoma, murine plasmacytoma, and human
multiple myeloma (MM; refs. 2–4). In myeloma, dysregulation of
myc can result ftrom a gene translocation with juxtaposition of
myc to the immunoglobulin enhancer (4). Another potential
mechanism of dysregulated transcription is from stimulation with
the myeloma growth factor interleukin (IL)-6 via a signal
transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT-3)–dependent
mechanism. However, this cytokine effect is cell type specific and
IL-6 treatment of some cells actually results in decreased myc
transcription (5, 6). Myc overexpression in MM cells can also be
due to up-regulated translation through cap-independent mechanisms (7, 8). Cap-independent translation is the fail-safe mecha-

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, constructs, reagents. The ANBL-6 wild-type (WT), K-ras–
transfected ANBL-6 and U266 cell lines were gifts from Dr. Brian Van Ness
(University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). The pRF construct was a kind
gift of Dr. A. Willis (University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom). The
c-myc and p27 IRESes were amplified from IMAGE clones 4667496 and
4298338, and cloned into the intercistronic region of pRF to generate pRmF
and pRp27F. These have been previously described in detail (14). The pRV-F, pSP65-R-F, and pSP65-R-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-F
plasmids were gifts from Dr. Greg Goodall (University of Adelaide, Adelaide,
Australia). They have also been previously described (15).
Primary myeloma samples. Primary patient myeloma cells were
isolated from bone marrow by positive selection for CD38 as previously
described (16). The purity was >99% plasma cells. These cells were then
treated with or without IL-6 and subsequently studied for myc expression
by Western blot and for myc IRES-dependent reporter expression by the
dicistronic assay (see below). In addition, four primary myeloma samples
that had been previously purified and cryopreserved were thawed and
washed, followed by immunoprecipitation of hnRNP A1 and assessment of
bound myc IRES by immunoprecipitation-reverse transcription-PCR (IP-RTPCR) assay (see below).
Western and Northern blot. Western and Northern blot was performed
as previously described (12, 14, 15).

Polysome analysis of translational state. As previously described (17),
cells treated with or without IL-6 and with or without rapamycin were lysed
in ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with 100 Ag/mL cycloheximide at 4jC.
After removal of nuclei and mitochondria, supernatants were layered onto
15% to 50% sucrose gradients and spun at 38,000 rpm for 2 h at 4jC in a
SW-40 rotor. Eleven 1-mL fractions were collected using an ISCO Density
Gradient Fractionator at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The UV absorbance at
254 nm of each fraction was measured to generate a polysome profile of the
sucrose gradient that was used to differentiate between the monosome
( fractions 1–3) and polysome ( fractions 4–11) fractions. The RNA from
individual fractions was extracted using phenol/chloroform and precipitated in ETOH. The RNA of fractions 1 to 3 (monosome) were pooled as were
the RNAs from fractions 4 to 11 (polysome-associated RNA). Northern blot
analysis was performed on these pooled RNA fractions for myc or actin. The
percent of total mRNA present (measured by densitometry of equally
exposed autoradiographs) in the polysomal fractions versus the monosomal
fractions were analyzed.
Dicistronic reporter assay. The reporter constructs were transfected
into cell lines or primary MM cells using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen)
and normalized for transfection efficiency by cotransfection with pSVhGal
(Promega). Transfection efficiency was generally 5% to 10%. A transfection
efficiency of at least 5% was required for carrying out a dicistronic reporter
assay. After 12 to 14 h, they were treated with or without IL-6 for varying
durations. Cells were then harvested, and Renilla luciferase, Firefly,
luciferase, and h-galactosidase activities were determined as previously
described (14). To test IRES-dependent reporter expression from transfected
RNA, polyadenylated dicistronic mRNAs were first generated in vitro (as
previously described in ref. 15), and 500 ng RNA were transfected by
electroporation (230V for 25 ms). Transfection efficiency was again
controlled by assaying h-galactosidase activity.
Yeast methods and screening. All constructs used for the yeast threehybrid assay were based on the RNA-Protein Hybrid Hunter System
(Invitrogen). cDNA encoding full-length hnRNP A1 was inserted into
pYesTrp3. A 233 nucleotide segment of the c-myc IRES was inserted into the
hybrid RNA plasmid pRH5¶. These plasmids were transformed into the
strain L40uraMS2 [MATa, ura3-52, leu2-3112, his3 -200, trp1 -1, ade2,
LYS2::(LexAop)4-HIS3, ura3:(LexAop)8-LacZ carrying pLexA/MS2/Zeo as
previously described (18)].
Filter binding assay. Indicated amounts of glutathione S-transferase
(GST)-hnRNP A1 were added to in vitro transcribed 32P-labeled RNAs
corresponding to either the c-myc IRES or the p27 IRES in separate
reactions in a volume of 10 mL in buffer containing 5 mmol/L HEPES (pH
7.6), 30 mmol/L KCL, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 200 mmol/L DTT, 4% glycerol, and
10 ng of yeast tRNA for 10 mins at room temperature. Eight microliters of
each binding reaction were applied to nitrocellulose membranes on a slot
blot apparatus (Minifold II; Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were washed,
dried, and signals were quantified using a phosphorimager. Binding curves
of three independent experiments were fitted by using SigmaPlot to
determine the apparent dissociation constants.
Evaluation of in vivo binding of hnRNP A1 to myc IRES. The IP-RTPCR assay was performed as previously described (19). Briefly, myeloma cell
lines were treated with or without IL-6 for varying durations, treated with
1% formaldehyde, and then hnRNP A1 was immunoprecipitated and bound
RNA was evaluated by RT-PCR. Real-time PCR for myc RNA and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) RNA was performed
on total extracted RNA from the immunoprecipitates.
Gene amplifications for real-time PCR were performed with an ABI
PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Each 20-AL
reaction in a 96-well plate comprised 9 AL of cDNA template, 1 AL of 20
primer mixtures for c-myc or GAPDH (containing 2 unlabeled primers for
amplifying the c-myc or GAPDH sequence, respectively, and 1 6-FAM dye–
labeled Taqman MGB Probe), and 10 AL 2Taqman Universal PCR Master
mixed with AmpErase UNG. Plates were sealed with adhesive optical film.
After an initial 2 min at 50jC to activate ampErase and a denaturation step
of 10 min at 95jC, 60 cycles of amplification were performed with
denaturation for 15 s at 95jC and annealing/extension for 1 min at 60jC. All
samples were run in triplicate and no template controls were included in all

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (24). December 15, 2008

plates for both c-myc and GAPDH. Comparative CT method with c-myc and
GAPDH in separate tubes was used according to manufacture’s manual. CT
corresponded to the number of cycles at which the fluorescence signal can
be detected above a threshold value, which is automatically set in our case.
siRNA analysis. siRNA transfections targeting human hnRNP A1 were
performed using synthetic oligonucleotides (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool;
Dharmacon) directed at sequences within the coding region and 3¶UTR. An
siRNA with a scrambled sequence was used as a negative-targeting control.
siRNAs were introduced into cells by electroporation (230V for 25 ms).
c-Myc protein turnover assay. c-Myc protein stability was determined
as previously described (20). Briefly, cells were stimulated with or without
IL-6 (100 U/mL) overnight and then preincubated (15 min in DMEM
without methionine and cysteine plus 5% dialyzed FCS) followed by a pulse
with Tran35S-label (ICN; 300 uCi/mL) for 1 h. The cells were then chased
(DMEM/10% FCS plus 400 mg/L methionine) as indicated in Fig. 1. Lysates
were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz).
EMSA. The c-myc IRES, Apaf-1 IRES, or GAPDH RNA were in vitro
transcribed (mMessage T7 transcription kit; Ambion) as previously
described (14) and 5¶ end labeled with (32P) g-ATP (GE Healthcare) using
T4 polynucleotide kinase. Radiolabeled RNA was incubated with or without
purified GST-hnRNP A1 in binding buffer containing 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH
7.5), 90 mmol/L potassium acetate, 1.5 mmol/L magnesium acetate,
2.5 mmol/L DTT, and 40U SUPERase-IN (Ambion) for 30 mins at 30jC.
Subsequent EMSA procedures were performed as described previously (21).
Statistics. The t test was used to determine significance of differences
between groups.

Results
Effects of IL-6 on myc expression and myc IRES activity in
MM cells. We initially studied the ANBL-6 MM cell line, which
expresses functional IL-6 receptors. ANBL-6 WT cells are IL-6
dependent in that their growth ceases after f1 to 2 weeks of IL-6
depletion. In contrast, ‘‘K-RAS’’ cells are ANBL-6 MM cells stably
transfected with an activated K-Ras allele (22). These cells become
IL-6 independent in that they proliferate in the absence of IL-6,
although they still respond to exogenous IL-6 with enhanced
growth. Activating mutations of K-RAS are frequently found in
primary MM specimens and correlate with aggressive disease (23).
The ANBL-6 cell line does not contain a myc-Ig translocation.
Both cell lines [WT empty vector–transfected and K-RAS–
transfected (K-RAS) ANBL-6 cells] were initially exposed to 100
U/mL of recombinant IL-6. Each cell line showed a significant
increase in growth as previously shown (22, 24). This growth was
accompanied by up-regulation of c-myc protein expression in both
lines (Fig. 1A, top). In contrast, Fig. 1A (bottom) shows that
induction of c-myc RNA only occurred in WT ANBL-6 cells. Two
additional experiments confirmed these results and also showed no
significant RNA induction in K-RAS mutated cells at earlier time
points (30–120 minutes). Northern data from all three experiments
are summarized as bar graphs in Fig. 1A. The latter K-RAS–
mutated cells may express heightened constitutive myc RNA
expression, which results from the RAS mutation with little room
for further stimulation when exposed to IL-6. Nevertheless, these
data show that the IL-6–induced up-regulation of c-myc protein
expression in mutant K-RAS–containing MM cells is not accompanied by increased RNA expression.
Additional studies, using the pulse-chase technique, showed that
the increased myc protein expression in IL-6–treated K-RAS cells
was not due to increased protein stability. As shown in Fig. 1B, the
opposite result was detected, namely a slight decrease in protein
stability due to IL-6 exposure. A second possible explanation for
enhanced protein expression could be an IL-6–induced stimulation
of cap-dependent translation. We had previously shown that IL-6

could activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in MM
cells (24, 25), which could achieve this effect. We, thus, addressed
effects of IL-6 on myc translation using the methodology of Zong
and colleagues (26), which is based on the observation that well
translated transcripts are associated with polysomes, whereas
poorly translated mRNAs are monosomal. ANBL-6 cells were
treated with or without IL-6, polysomes were separated from
monosomes on a sucrose gradient, and the associated RNA from
these two groups was assessed by Northern analysis. Densitometric
analysis of the signals obtained from monosomal versus polysomal
fractions confirmed an enhancement in c-myc translation induced
by IL-6. IL-6 induced an increase in polysome c-myc RNA from 28%
to 44% in WT ANBL-6 cells and from 25% to 52% in K-RAS mutant
cells (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, however, the mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin (at 1 and 10 nmol/L) had no effect on enhanced
translation although both concentrations inhibited mTOR mediated phosphorylation of p70S6kinase with complete ablation at
10 nmol/L (Fig. 1D). This indicated that the increase in c-myc
translation induced by IL-6 was not mediated by mTOR and capdependent translation, and suggested a role for cap-independent
translation.
To test whether IL-6 enhanced IRES-dependent cap-independent
translation, we used the myc discistronic vector in which the myc
5¶UTR, containing its IRES, was subcloned into the intracistronic

www.aacrjournals.org

space between the Renilla and Firefly luciferase open reading
frames in the parental pRF vector (ref. 14; Fig. 2A). This generated
the pRmF vector whose firefly luciferase translation would be
driven by the 5¶UTR. As a control, we also subcloned the p27 IRES
into pRF, generating the pRp27F vector. After transfection of WT or
K-RAS cells with the vectors, the mRNAs were tested for their
ability to direct cap-independent translation (Firefly luciferase).
Results (Fig. 2B) are normalized for transfection efficiency by
cotransfection with a h-galactosidase construct. The presence of
the myc 5¶UTR IRES in pRmF markedly enhanced Firefly luciferase
expression (versus pRF) in both WT and K-RAS lines while having
no effect on Renilla luciferase expression, a monitor of capdependent translation. When exposed to 100 U/mL IL-6, a timedependent increase in Firefly luciferase was shown in both cell
lines. As a negative control, Fig. 2B shows that similar IL-6
treatment of K-RAS cells did not increase firefly luciferase driven by
the p27 IRES (right). It is difficult to see in Fig. 2 because of the
range of luciferase activity assayed (Y axis), but there was a very
modest but significant increase in Renilla luciferase expression also
after IL-6 exposure [to 150–175% of control values (no IL-6)]. This
is consistent with the positive effect of IL-6 on global capdependent translation secondary to activation of mTOR. A
representative experiment with raw data are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.

Cancer Research

To further support an effect of IL-6 on myc IRES activity in MM
cells, we studied a third cell line, the U266 MM line, in which an
autocrine IL-6 growth pathway exists. This cell line secretes IL-6,
which, subsequent to its binding to IL-6 receptors, results in
activation of many pathways and cell growth. As shown in Fig. 2C,
U266 cells exhibit a huge amount of myc IRES activity, shown by
the marked increase in Firefly luciferase expression in pRmF
compared with pRF. When the cells are exposed to neutralizing
anti–IL-6 and blocking anti-IL-6R antibodies (+anti–IL-6 AB),
Firefly luciferase is greatly inhibited, whereas identical concentrations of isotype-specific control antibodies have no effect. To the
right of Fig. 2C is shown an immunoblot assay for STAT-3
phosphorylation (STAT-3-P) used as a monitor for IL-6 signal
transduction. It shows that the anti–IL-6/anti-IL6R antibodies
interrupted the IL-6 autocrine loop, whereas the control antibodies
had no effect. Thus, these results in three IL-6–responsive MM cell
lines show that this growth factor enhanced RAP-resistant myc

translation and myc IRES activity. This up-regulation of IRES
activity completely explains the enhanced myc protein expression
in IL-6–treated mutant RAS-containing cells and works together
with enhanced RNA expression in WT cells.
To rule out the possibility that IL-6 increased myc firefly
luciferase expression because of effects on a cryptic myc promoter
located in the 5¶UTR, we exploited RNA transfection using
dicistronic RNAs to avoid cryptic promoter activity. To achieve
this, the control pRF dicistronic reporter construct or the
corresponding construct containing the myc 5¶UTR in the
dicistronic space was inserted into the pSP65-20B vector, which
contains the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter and a 38 nucleotide
polyadenylic acid tail (gift of Dr. Greg Goodall). Polyadenylated
dicistronic RNAs were generated (Fig. 3A) and transfected into
ANBL-6 WT cells. As an additional control, we also used the
dicistronic RNA, which contains the VEGF 5¶UTR in the intracistronic space (pR-V-F, generated as previously described in

ref. 15). The Renilla and Firefly luciferase activity was then
measured, and the relative luciferase activity of pRmF RNA was
compared with the pRF control RNA in MM cells treated with or
without IL-6. As shown in Fig. 3B, IL-6 significantly enhanced firefly
luciferase expression in pRmF RNA-transfected cells by 2.5-fold
while having no effect on expression in cells transfected with
control pRF RNA or in the additional control cells transfected with
the VEGF 5¶UTR-containing RNA (pR-V-F). This ruled out the
possibility of a cryptic promoter in the myc IRES DNA that could
have responded to IL-6 stimulation.
Identification of hnRNP A1 as a potential IL-6–responsive
c-myc ITAF. We initially hypothesized that an IL-6–induced
increase in enhancing ITAFs or a decrease in inhibitory ITAFs could
explain an increased IRES activity. However, no significant effects
of IL-6 were found on protein levels of known myc ITAFs (including
PTB, hnRNP K, hnRNP E1/E2, hnRNP C1/C2, and unr) or their
electrophoretic mobility (data not shown). We, thus, used a yeast
three-hybrid screen (Supplementary Fig. S2) to identify novel
proteins, which specifically bound to the smallest construct
containing sequences from the myc 5¶UTR, which retained full
IRES activity, a nucleotide segment spanning 396 to 165
upstream of the initiation codon. From this screen, we identified
several clones encoding hnRNP A1, which specifically bound to the
c-myc IRES sequence and was dependent on both the IRES
sequence and the hnRNP A1 activation domain fusion for reporter
expression.
Filter binding assays (Fig. 4A) and EMSA analysis (Fig. 4B)
showed specific binding of hnRNP A1 to the myc IRES. The kDa for
A1 binding to the myc IRES was f200 nmol/L, whereas binding to
the p27 IRES (Fig. 4A, darkened circles) was undetectable. In
EMSAs, addition of recombinant hnRNP A1 retarded the migration
of radiolabeled c-myc IRES but had no effect on migration of the
Apaf-1 IRES or GAPDH RNA (Fig. 4B). In addition, when added as
recombinant protein to extracts prepared from U87 cells in which

www.aacrjournals.org

endogenous hnRNP A1 had been silenced, hnRNP A1 markedly
enhanced myc IRES-dependent reporter expression (27). These
data indicate hnRNP A1 is an ITAF for the myc IRES.
Although IL-6 had no effect on the expression level of hnRNP A1
in MM cells (Fig. 4C), it increased the binding of A1 to the myc
IRES in vivo as determined in an IP-RT-PCR assay (Fig. 4D). In this
experiment, we treated both ANBL-6 WT and ‘‘K-RAS’’ cell lines
with IL-6 and, after varying incubation periods, immunoprecipitated hnRNP A1, and performed PCR analysis on the precipitate for
detection of myc IRES sequences. As shown in Fig. 4D, myc IRES
RNA binding to hnRNP A1 was undetected in resting WT ANBL-6
MM cells, whereas a modest amount was bound to A1 in K-RAS
cells. As a control, immunoprecipitation with nonspecific IgG could
not bring down any myc IRES sequences. Exposure to IL-6 induced
an increase in binding of hnRNP A1 to the myc IRES in both cell
lines in a time-dependent fashion with optimal binding at 0.5 to
3 hours. To further confirm these data, we performed real-time
PCR for quantification of myc IRES sequences bound to hnRNP A1.
As shown in Fig. 4E, the real-time PCR data are consistent with
a maximal induced binding after 3 hours of IL-6 exposure up to
7-fold over control (no IL-6). Thus, IL-6 increased the amount of
hnRNP A1 bound to the myc IRES inside MM cells, and this was not
due to any increase in A1 expression.
Although IL-6 did not alter total expression of hnRNP A1, A1
became serine phosphorylated as shown in Fig. 4F. In this
experiment, ANBL-6 MM cells were treated with or without IL-6
or, as a positive control for A1 phosphorylation, sorbitol (28). HNRNP A1 was then immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted for
phospho-serine or total A1. As shown, A1 serine phosphorylation
due to IL-6 exposure was comparable with that of sorbitol
treatment. In a time course experiment, serine phosphorylation
of A1 in MM cells was identified by 2 hours of exposure to IL-6
(Fig. 4F).
Effect of hnRNP A1 knockdown. To directly test a role for
hnRNP A1 in the IL-6–induced stimulation of myc IRES function,
A1 was silenced by siRNA, using a pool of three siRNA sequences.
As shown in Fig. 5A (top gel), effective knockdown of A1 was
accomplished in K-RAS cells with a pool of scrambled sequences
having no effect. These cell lines were then treated with or without
IL-6, and the IRES-dependent discistronic reporter assay was
performed. As shown in Fig. 5B, A1 knockdown prevented the
ability of IL-6 to stimulate myc IRES activity. In addition, there was
a corresponding absence of myc protein up-regulated expression in
these IL-6–treated cells (Fig. 5A, bottom gel). Finally, the A1 siRNA
silencing also prevented the ability of IL-6 to stimulate cell growth
in vitro (Fig. 5C).
Studies in primary MM specimens. To test whether IL-6 could
enhance myc IRES function in primary MM specimens, three
patient bone marrow samples were processed (see Materials &
Methods) to isolate pure myeloma tumor cell populations (>99%
pure). The cells were treated with or without IL-6 (100 u/mL for
6 hours) and then transiently transfected with the dicistronic
reporters to test IRES activity. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, the
patient samples showed a significant enhancement of firefly
luciferase expression (IRES activity) and myc protein expression
after exposure to IL-6.
We were also able to investigate if hnRNP A1 binds the myc IRES
in primary MM cells. Cryopreserved patient-isolated myeloma cell
specimens (>99% pure tumor cells, n = 4) were thawed, RNAprotein binding was secured by treatment with 1% formaldehyde,
and A1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-A1 antibody or control

performed to show binding of hnRNP A1 to the myc IRES (top ) but not to the Apaf-1 IRES (middle ) or to GAPDH RNA (bottom ). C, Western blot for hnRNP A1
protein expression in ANBL-6 cells treated with IL-6 for 0, 2, or 4 h. D, WT or K-RAS–mutated ANBL-6 cells were treated with IL-6 for 0 to 12 h and, at varying time points,
hnRNP A1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-A1 antibody (hnRNPA1 ) or control antibody (IgG ). RT-PCR was then performed on the immunoprecipitates for presence of
the myc IRES. E, hnRNP A1 was immunoprecipitated as in B after varying durations of IL-6 exposure and real-time PCR performed for quantification of the attached
myc IRES. Open bars, WT ANBL-6 cells; dark bars, K-RAS cells. F, ANBL-6 cells treated with IL-6 (100 u/mL) or sorbitol (S, 600 mmol/L) for 3 h (top gels ) or IL-6 for
varying time points (bottom gels ) after which A1 was immunoprecipitated and the precipitate was immunoblotted with an antibody against total A1 or phosphoserine.

IgG. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed for bound myc
IRES RNA by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 6C, the myc IRES was
present in the anti-A1 immunoprecipitates obtained from all the
myeloma patient samples. Thus, in vivo binding between hnRNP A1
and the myc IRES is present in primary MM cells.

Discussion
The results of this study indicate that part of the up-regulation of
myc protein expression in MM cells stimulated with IL-6 is due to
enhanced IRES-dependent translation. This was shown in the
ANBL-6 MM cell model, the U266 cell line and in primary MM
specimens. Furthermore, hnRNP A1 is an important protein that
mediates IL-6–induced enhancement of myc translation. Importantly, siRNA knockdown of A1 expression in RAS-mutated MM
cells prevented the stimulation of myc IRES activity, curtailed
up-regulation of myc protein expression, and abrogated
IL-6–enhanced cell growth.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (24). December 15, 2008

HnRNP A1 has recently been identified as an ITAF for the
fibroblast growth factor-2 and XIAP IRESes (29, 30), and our data
(27) support its role as a myc ITAF. The ability of IL-6 to increase
the binding between A1, and the myc IRES suggests a possible
mechanism that could explain how A1 mediates the IL-6 effect on
IRES activity. This increased binding may facilitate the ability of A1
to induce the proper conformational change in the IRES required
for recruitment to the 40S ribosomal subunit. Whether or not the
detected IL-6–induced serine phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 is
critical for the enhanced A1-IRES binding remains to be examined.
An additional potential mechanism that must be considered is
that IL-6 enhances A1 cytoplasmic localization. Initial binding
between A1 and the myc IRES presumably occurs in the nucleus
where hnRNP A1 is primarily localized. However, A1 is a nuclearcytoplasmic shuttling protein and is likely involved in the nuclear
export of mRNAs such as myc to the cytoplasm, the translationally
competent compartment. Cytoplasmic shuttling is regulated by
phosphorylation of A1 on 4 serine residues in the F peptide, an 18

c-Myc Translation, IL-6, and hnRNP A1 in Myeloma

Figure 5. A, K-RAS cells were electroporated
with siRNA for hnRNP A1 (siRNA ) or control
scrambled sequences (SCR ). Sixteen hours
later, viable cells were immunoblotted for
expression of hnRNP A1 (A1) or actin (top ) or
treated with or without IL-6 (100 U/mL, 24 h),
after which immunoblot assay was performed
for expression of c-myc or actin (bottom ).
B, K-RAS cells were electroporated and
treated with or without IL-6 as in A. Cells were
transiently transfected with the dicistronic pRF
or pRmF reporter plasmids and luciferase
expression was assayed. Results are Firefly/
Renilla ratios; columns, mean of three
experiments; bars, SD. Cells knocked down for
A1 expression (siA1 ) showed no IL-6–induced
increase in Firefly/Renilla ratios, whereas
cells exposed to scrambled control did show a
significant increase (P < 0.05). C, K-RAS
cells were electroporated with SCR or siRNA
and treated with or without IL-6 as in B and

later. Results are fold increase over control

amino acid segment in the COOH terminus of the protein (31, 32).
Such phosphorylation is mediated by MNK kinases (33) that are
activated downstream of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK; ref. 34). Although IL-6 does not activate the p38MAPK
cascade, it is well-accepted that it can activate the RAS-RAF-MAP/
ERK kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK
cascade (12). Interestingly, MNKs can also be activated by ERK
(35). Thus, an additional potential mechanism of IL-6 stimulation
of A1-IRES function is via stimulation of ERK with subsequent
activation of MNKs, MNK-dependent phosphorylation of A1 at the

F peptide and enhanced shuttling of A1/Myc RNA to the
cytoplasmic translational compartment. Experiments are under
way to determine which residues of A1 become serine phosphorylated by IL-6 and whether there is an IL-6–dependent increase in
A1 cytoplasmic localization.
Recent work (36) supports the hypothesis that dysregulation of
c-myc expression is key to the progression from the premalignant
MGUS syndrome to overt myeloma. Gene set enrichment analysis
identified a myc activation gene set signature that was significantly associated with MM compared with MGUS. Because myc

Figure 6. A and B, primary myeloma cells
were isolated from three separate patients
and treated with or without IL-6. Eighteen
hours later, immunoblot assay was
performed on an aliquot of cells for
c-myc or actin expression (A) and the
dicistronic reporter assay performed on
another aliquot (B ). Results in B are
presented as Firefly (FF)/Renilla (R)
luciferase ratios for each patient where 1 is
arbitrarily identified as the pRF values in
absence of IL-6. C, cryoperserved primary
isolated myeloma cells from four patients
were thawed, and protein extracts were
immunoprecipitated with anti-hnRNP
A1 antibody (A1 ) or control IgG.
RT-PCR analysis was then performed for
identification of hnRNP A1 IRES bound to
the immunoprecipitated hnRNP A1.

translocations to the immunoglobulin enhancer element only
occur in f15% of newly diagnosed patients (37), it is possible that
a heightened myc translation is also important in progression and
this may be facilitated by hnRNP A1 after IL-6 stimulation.
In summary, our data underscore the potential importance of
a myc RNA-binding protein, hnRNP A1, in the enhanced myc
translation that occurs in myeloma cells whose growth is
stimulated by IL-6. A further understanding of the regulation of
A1 and myc IRES function may allow future manipulation of
myeloma tumor growth by targeting A1 therapeutically.
