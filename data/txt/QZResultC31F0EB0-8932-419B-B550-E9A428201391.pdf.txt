Abstract
Nitric oxide–donating nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NO-NSAIDs) are an emergent class of pharmaceutical derivatives with promising utility as cancer chemopreventive
agents. Aspirin and sulindac have been shown to be effective
in selecting for cells with reduced microsatellite instability
(MSI) that is inherent in mismatch repair (MMR)–deficient
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) cells. The
effect of NO-NSAIDs on MSI in MMR-deficient HNPCC cells is
unknown. Here, we have examined genetically defined MMRdeficient murine embryo fibroblasts, murine colonocytes, and
isogenic human HNPCC tumor cell lines treated with
acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin; ASA) and three isomeric derivatives of NO-aspirin (NO-ASA). The MSI profiles were determined and compared with the Bethesda Criteria. We found
that the ASA- and NO-ASA–treated MMR-deficient cell lines
displayed a dose-dependent suppression of MSI that appeared
as early as 8 weeks and gradually increased to include up
to 67% of the microsatellite sequences examined after 19 to
20 weeks of continuous treatment. Residual resistance to
microsatellite stabilization was largely confined to mononucleotide repeat sequences. Control (MMR-proficient) cells
showed no changes in microsatellite status with or without
treatment. The relative dose-dependent stabilization selection
was: ortho-NO-ASA  para-NO-ASA > meta-NO-ASA J ASA.
Moreover, the doses required for stabilization by the orthoand para-NO-ASA were 300- to 3,000-fold lower than ASA.
These results suggest that NO-ASA derivatives may be more
effective at suppressing MSI in MMR-deficient cell lines than
ASA and should be considered for chemopreventive trials with
HNPCC carriers. [Cancer Res 2007;67(22):10966–75]

Introduction
Nitric oxide–donating nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NO-NSAIDs) are an emerging class of compounds that may prove
efficacious as chemopreventive agents in the treatment of
colorectal and other forms of cancer (1, 2). Several studies have

shown that NO-NSAIDs inhibit the growth of a variety of human
tumor cell lines 10- to 6,000-fold more potently than their parental counterparts (3–5). NO-aspirin (NO-ASA) derivatives have been
reported as the most potent of the NO-NSAIDs studied to date
(6, 7). In specific experimental systems, NO-ASAs appear to be at
least 100-fold more active than other NO-NSAIDs (3, 5). They
may be synthesized as one of three different positional isomers,
ortho-, meta-, or para-, depending on where the nitrogen-donating
(CH2ONO2) group is attached to the benzene spacer (Fig. 1).
The observed pharmacologic superiority of NO-ASA versus ASA
has been extended to more physiologically relevant models of
tumor formation in rats and mice (8, 9). In both animal models,
NO-ASA was more effective than ASA in reducing tumor burden.
Recent studies in rats and hamsters have shown that NO-ASA can
be administered at levels up to 3,000 ppm without deleterious
effects on the animal model (10, 11). Furthermore, a recent clinical
study has shown that administration of meta-NO-ASA to human
subjects for 1 week resulted in minimal gastrointestinal toxicity
(12). The potential advantages of incorporating NO-ASA into a
chemopreventive regime are immediately obvious: (a) retention of
the well-documented prophylactic antitumorigenic activity of ASA
and (b) alleviation/elimination of side effects associated with longterm ASA administration, notably gastrointestinal and renal
damage.
DNA mismatch repair (MMR) functions in the repair of
postreplication misincorporation errors, mismatches generated
during genetic recombination, repair of several DNA damage–
specific lesions, as well as apoptotic signaling following extensive
genomic damage ( for review, see ref. 13). The human MMR
proteins function as heterodimers ( for review, see ref. 14). The
human MutS homologues (MSH) play a fundamental role in
mismatch/lesion/structure recognition and include hMSH2hMSH3, hMSH2-hMSH6, and hMSH4-hMSH5. The human MutL
homologues (MLH) appear to transduce the initial MSH recognition to downstream effectors that include hMLH1-hPMS1,
hMLH1-hPMS2, and hMLH1-hMLH3. There is compelling evidence
that links hMSH2, hMSH6, hMLH1, and hPMS2 with hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; ref. 15). The remaining
MSH and MLH homologues are either unlinked to HNPCC
(hMSH3, hMSH4, hMSH5, hPMS1) or remain controversial
(hMLH3; ref. 16). Tumor tissues from the vast majority of HNPCC
cases associated with MMR defects display microsatellite instability (MSI; ref. 17). MSI is generally considered a convenient
marker of the elevated mutation rates (mutator phenotype)
associated with MMR defects. It is the mutator phenotype that

has been suggested to provide the environment for the
accumulation of the multiple mutations that appears to drive
tumorigenesis (18).
Our previous work demostrated that ASA and sulindac suppressed the MSI mutator phenotype of several human colon tumor
cell lines (19). The mechanism appeared to be via a genetic
selection that enhanced apoptosis in cells undergoing MSI. These
observations suggested a potential prophylactic treatment for
the HNPCC genetic susceptibility. Unfortunately, the toxicity and
side effects of prolonged ASA or sulindac treatment significantly
reduces enthusiasm for their effective use as chemopreventives.
Here, we have examined isogenic Msh2-deficient murine
fibroblast and colonic epithelial cell lines as well as near-isogenic
human hMLH1-deficient human colon tumor cell lines to
determine the efficacy of the ortho-, meta-, and para-NO-ASA
derivatives on the suppression of MSI. We found that all of the NOASA positional isomers suppress MSI following 8 to 12 weeks of
continuous treatment. These results are consistent with our
previous conclusion that ASA aids in the acquisition of a
microsatellite-stable (MSS) phenotype via a genetic selection
process (19). Because MSI is required to accelerate tumorigenesis
in HNPCC and MMR-deficient mice, these results suggest that NOASAs may be an important chemopreventive for HNPCC.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from
12 to 13 dpc embryos using standard methods. Early passage MEFs were
immortalized with the adenovirus 12S E1A gene using the protocols
outlined by McCurrach and Lowe (20). E1A-transformed MEFs were
produced from wild-type and Msh2/ MEFs. Colonocyte cell lines were
generated from p53/ and p53/Msh2/ mice according to Sevignani et
al. (21). The HCT116(hMLH1/) cell line was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection. HCT116(hMLH1/) cells complemented with
either human chromosome 2 [HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr2(hMLH1)], or
chromosome 3 [HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr3(hMLH1+)], were provided by the
laboratory of Dr. Richard Boland (Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas,
TX; ref. 22). All cell lines were grown in DMEM containing 25 mmol/L of
D-glucose, 4 mmol/L of L-glutamine, and 25 mmol/L of HEPES (Life
Technologies). The medium was supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (Life
Technologies) and 50 Ag/mL of penicillin/streptomycin.
ASA and NO-ASA reagents. ASA (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO to
give a stock solution of 2 mol/L. The NO-donating derivatives of ASA [2(acetyloxy)benzoic acid 2-[(nitrooxy)methyl]phenyl ester; NCX-4060] (orthoNO-ASA) and [2-(acetyloxy)benzoic acid 4-[(nitrooxy)methyl]phenyl ester;
NCX-4040] (para-NO-ASA) were dissolved in DMSO to give stock solutions
of 100 mmol/L. [2-(Acetyloxy)benzoic acid 3-[(nitrooxy)methyl]phenyl ester;

www.aacrjournals.org

NCX-4016] (meta-NO-ASA) was dissolved in DMSO to give a stock solution
of 400 mmol/L. All drug stocks were aliquoted and stored at 20jC.
Treatment of cell lines with ASA and NO-ASA. To determine the IC50
of ASA and NO-ASA, cells were plated into either 12- or 24-well dishes at
concentrations between 5 to 8  104 and 2.5 to 4  104 cells per well,
respectively. Cells were treated with a selected range of concentrations of
each ASA or NO-ASA drug; for example, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 Amol/L of orthoNO-ASA (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Negative controls of medium alone
(DMEM) and DMEM + DMSO carrier (DMSO) were included in the analysis.
The final concentration of DMSO in each cell treatment never exceeded
0.1%, except when final concentrations above 2 mmol/L of ASA were being
examined. Drugs were added within a 3-h period after cells had been plated.
Experiments were done in triplicate. After 5 days, cells were washed with
PBS, trypsinized, pelleted at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, stained with 0.4% trypan
blue, and viable cells were counted.
Long-term drug treatment for MSI analysis. Cells were initially plated
into six-well dishes at 2  105 cells per well, and treated with ASA and NOASAs. The concentrations of ASA and NO-ASA were lower than the IC50, and
are found in Supplementary Tables S1 to S12. A smaller subset of two
concentrations of each reagent was selected for long-term exposure of each
cell line. Negative controls of DMEM and DMSO were included. Cells were
split when confluent and were under continual exposure to the drugs. In the
early stages of the treatments, cells were counted and re-plated at 2  105
cells per well. Exceptions were made if cells were growing poorly, usually as
a consequence of drug treatment, and most often in the early days of the
experiment. In this case, cells were split at a slightly higher density of 4 to
5  105 cells per well. At various time points, a portion of each cell suspension was saved for subsequent isolation of its genomic DNA and MSI
analysis.
MSI analysis of treated cell line DNAs. The mouse primers used in this
study have previously been reported by Kabbarah et al. (23) as TG27, TA27,
GA29, CT25/CA27, A33, and T27. They have been re-designated MSM01 to
MSM06 herein for simplicity. The human primers have previously been
reported by Ruschoff et al. (19) as BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, D5S346, D2S123,
and D17S250. They have been re-designated MSM11 to MSM16 for simplicity. One oligomer of each primer set was 5¶-labeled with FAM, VIC or NED.
Details for all primer pairs are presented in Supplementary Table S13.
Genomic DNA was prepared from drug-treated mouse and human cell
lines using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). DNA was amplified with Platinum
Pfx DNA polymerase. The final components of the reaction mix were as
follows: DNA (1–2 ng; f100–200 genome equivalents; <0.5% total genomes);
amplification buffer (2 concentration); 1 mmol/L of MgSO4; 300 Amol/L of
deoxynucleotide triphosphates; 300 nmol/L of each primer; 1 unit of Pfx;
and H2O to a final volume of 15 AL. The following amplification conditions
were used as a standard: 94jC, 2 min (94jC, 30 s; 54jC, 30 s; 68jC, 30 s) for
30 to 35 cycles; 68jC, 2 min. Samples were diluted and analyzed on an
Applied Biosystems 3730. At least three independent amplification reactions
of each microsatellite sequence were examined for each genomic DNA
sample.

Results
ASA and NO-ASA inhibit mammalian cell growth in vitro.
Prior to treatment, we examined the effect of ASA and NO-ASA
positional isomers on cell growth. Mammalian cell lines were
seeded into 12- or 24-well plates at 2.5 to 5  104 cells/mL and
treated with a range of ASA and NO-ASA concentrations. The IC50
values were determined following a 5-day exposure to estimate the
appropriate drug concentrations that could be tolerated (Table 1).
Representative survival curves are depicted in Supplementary
Fig. S1.
The MMR-deficient murine colonocytes and MEFs appear to
display a modest resistance to ASA and NO-ASA positional isomers
compared with their isogenic wild-type controls (Table 1). For
example, the meta-NO-ASA IC50 is 148 Amol/L for MMR-deficient
p53/Msh2/ colonocytes, compared with 91 Amol/L for the
corresponding MMR-proficient p53/ colonocytes. These observations appear similar to the drug resistance observed when MMRdeficient cells are treated with several DNA damaging agents such
as methylmethane sulfonate ( for review, see ref. 24).
The human tumor cell line HCT116(hMLH1/) is MMR-deficient
as a result of biallelic mutation of the hMLH1 gene (22). Transfer of
chromosome 2 or chromosome 3 into the HCT116(hMLH1/) cell
line yielded the MMR-deficient HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr2(hMLH1)
cell line and the MMR-proficient HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr3(hMLH1+)
cell line, respectively. The MMR status of these cell lines has been
verified by repair assays and Western analysis for MLH1 expression
(ref. 22; data not shown). These nearly isogenic human cell lines do not
appear to show a consistent sensitivity to ASA or NO-ASA positional
isomers. Although both cell lines lack hMLH1 and are MMR-deficient,

para -NO-ASA are an isomeric family of compounds based on the parental
molecule of ASA (gray box ). They differ only in the position at which the nitrogendonating —CH2ONO2 group is attached to the benzene spacer.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (22). November 15, 2007

the meta-NO-ASA IC50 is 138 Amol/L for HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr2
(hMLH1 ) but only 59 Amol/L for the parental cell line
HCT116(hMLH1/). Similarly the para-NO-ASA IC50 is 2.29 Amol/L
for HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr2(hMLH1) and only 0.81 Amol/L for
HCT116(hMLH1/). Restoration of MMR by expression of hMLH1 in
the HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr3(hMLH1+) cell line confers increased
tolerance to meta-NO-ASA compared with HCT116(hMLH1/).
These data appear to underline the differences in human tumor cell
line derivatives versus murine MEFs and colonocyte epithelial cells.
Importantly, the murine cells were derived from isogenic mice that
differ solely in their MMR (Msh2) status, whereas the tumor-derived
human cell lines may harbor multiple known and unknown mutations
associated with tumor development. The mechanism of modest
resistance to ASA and NO-ASA positional isomers in Msh2/ murine
cell lines is unknown.
Both the ortho-NO-ASA and para-NO-ASA isomers appear to be
500- to 4,000-fold more efficient than ASA at inhibiting mammalian
cell growth (Table 1). The IC50 data highlights the striking effect
that substitution of the —ONO2 group at the meta position on the
benzene linker has on the biological properties of this family of
compounds (Fig. 1). The meta-NO-ASA seems to be 100- to 250-fold
less efficient at inhibiting cell growth compared with the ortho- or
para-NO-ASA. These results appear consistent with previous
reports comparing these derivatives (2).
Development of a simplified screen for altered MSI. Previous
work suggested that treatment of MMR-defective tumor cell lines
with ASA or sulindac induced a genetic selection for microsatellite
stability in MMR-defective human tumor cells (19). These studies
were done by a laborious method that included isolation of
multiple microclones from a total cell population during drug
treatment. Once isolated, the microclones allowed the quantification of MSI within the population during the process of
stabilization. For example, these studies suggested that numerous
microclones isolated from hMSH2- and hMLH1-deficient tumor
cell lines display 40% to 60% MSI. That is, 40% to 60% of the
microclones differed in microsatellite size from a canonical starting
size. Long-term treatment with ASA or sulindac resulted in <5% of
these microclones with a different microsatellite size (19).
We reasoned that continuous splitting (reduction) of a
population of growing cells undergoing selection for stable
microsatellite sequences (In ! SIn) was the population equivalent
of isolating stable microclones (Fig. 2B). This idea is based on the
observation that ASA/sulindac–treated MSI cells were shown to
enter an apoptotic pathway while the selected MSS cells continued
to grow (19). Furthermore, sampling a fraction of the total genomes
(<0.5% or f500 genome equivalents) at each time point enhanced
the likelihood of identifying altered microsatellite sizes. By this
method, we defined MSS when at least three independent
fractional samples displayed an equivalent microsatellite pattern.
The final MSS cell population need not necessarily contain a
single microsatellite size (SI1). Rather the MSS cells might contain
several microsatellite sizes (SIn) that would result in a combined
MSS pattern (Fig. 2B). Our fractional genomic sampling method
merely places a lower limit on the probability of cells in the
population containing a recently altered microsatellite size that
would result in classification as MSI.
Examples of the selection of an MSS cell population from an MSI
cell population are shown in Fig. 2. Untreated E1A Msh2/ MEFs
display an enduring altered microsatellite pattern (MSI) relative to
a known size control over the course of 156 days of growth: for
these cells, this period approximates 156 generations (Fig. 2A). It

Figure 2. NO-ASA driven selection of MSS cells from a founding population of genetically microsatellite unstable cells. A, the MSI profile of untreated E1A
Msh/ MEFs continues to change in culture over time. Because there is no drug treatment, there is no selection process for an emergent stable microsatellite profile.
The MSI profile of this cell line, as assessed by amplification of MSM06 (A27), is different at all of the sample times, indicating continuing instability of the
mean allele size of this locus. B, the MSI/MSS screen suggests that within the microsatellite-unstable population of MMR-defective cells containing n microsatellite
lengths (dark gray circles; In, Instability), there is a subset of cells that have a MSS phenotype with a subset of SIn microsatellite lengths, (light gray circles;
SIn, Stabilization of Instability). Although the latter cells only comprise a minority of the total cell population, they can be selected by treatment with NO-ASAs
(see ref. 19). These agents confer either a subsequent growth advantage to cells that are SIn and/or selectively eliminate cells that are In, through apoptotic processes
(19). With continual exposure to NO-ASAs, the relative proportion of SIn cells within the population increases to the point where they eclipse the In cells. Note
that emergent SIn cells do not necessarily have the same stable microsatellite pattern (i.e., they are only required to retain a stable phenotype). C, E1A MSH/
MEFs treated with para -NO-ASA demonstrate stabilization of MSI at marker MSM06 (A27). Prolonged exposure results in stabilization of the MSI profile after 123 days
(compare 123 days to 156 days). D, HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr2(hMLH1) cells treated with ortho -NO-ASA demonstrate stabilization of MSI at microsatellite marker
MSM16 (AC25). The MSM16 marker contains two alleles. Although single-allele stabilization appears to have occurred by 84 days, drug-induced stabilization of
both alleles by treatment with ortho -NO-ASA occurred only by 112 days (see Fig. 5). Small arrowhead, position of known size control (bottom ); large arrowhead and
dashed line, position of major allele(s) relative to the last time point (top ).

should be noted that the amplification of microsatellite sequences
by PCR results in a normal distribution of repeat sizes surrounding
the absolute microsatellite size (stutter pattern). The available data
suggests that this is a result of repetitive polymerase misincorporation errors associated with cyclic (PCR) copying of repeat
sequences (25). The absolute length of a microsatellite may be
determined as the highest peak length within the stutter pattern.
For a population of cells with multiple microsatellite lengths, the
highest peak length within the stutter pattern corresponds to the
average microsatellite size.
In contrast to untreated cells, E1A Msh2/ MEFs treated
continuously with 0.5 Amol/L of para-NO-ASA display MSI that
gradually transitions to a stable microsatellite size pattern (MSS)
by 123 days (Fig. 2C). Similarly, HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr2(hMLH1)

www.aacrjournals.org

treated with 5 Amol/L of ortho-NO-ASA displayed MSI at heterozygous microsatellite alleles of a single locus (Fig. 2D). However, by
112 days of continuous treatment, both alleles display MSS (Fig. 2D).
This analysis of altered/stable microsatellite patterns was used to
screen mouse and human MMR-deficient cell lines using panels of
six mouse or six human diagnostic microsatellite markers,
respectively (Supplementary Table S13).
ASA and NO-ASA treatment regimen for mammalian cell
lines. The IC50 data (Table 1) was instrumental in estimating the
concentrations of ASA and NO-ASAs to be used for the long-term
exposure of mouse E1A MEFs and colonocytes. A range of drug concentrations roughly centered on the IC50 values was initially
selected. We regarded it likely that drug concentrations much
higher than the IC50 would result in population cell death, especially

Figure 3. Long-term treatment of MMR-deficient mouse cell lines with NO-ASAs selects for a population of MSS cells. A, treatment of MSS E1A Msh2+/+ MEFs
with NO-ASAs does not alter the microsatellite marker pattern. MMR-proficient E1A Msh2+/+ MEFs were split at day 0 and subjected to treatment with 0.5 Amol/L
of ortho -NO-ASA. DNA samples were prepared from cells at the times indicated and marker MSM01 was analyzed to reveal any drug-induced changes of this
microsatellite pattern (see Supplementary Tables S1–S8). B, the MSI status of p53/Msh2/ colonocytes indicates independent evolution of microsatellite patterns
following different treatments of the same starting cell line. MMR-defective colonocytes were split at day 0 and subjected to the treatments shown. After 84 days,
all cell lines displayed a different pattern for microsatellite marker MSM01 compared with t = 0; major allele bands of 137, 137, 139, and 135 bp, respectively
(top to bottom ). C, treatment of p53/Msh2/ colonocytes with meta-NO-ASA selects for a cell population that displays a stable microsatellite pattern at the
previously unstable microsatellite marker MSM01. MMR-defective mouse colonocytes were treated with meta -NO-ASA and DNA samples were isolated at the times
indicated. After 28 days, the major allele was 137 bp, which had changed to 139 bp by day 66, and then 135 bp by day 84. At day 123 and all-subsequent days,
MSM01 remained constant at 135 bp, indicating that drug treatment had resulted in stabilization at this previously unstable microsatellite marker. Small arrowheads,

during long-term exposure. However, it was formally possible that
such long-term exposure might result in drug tolerance and
eventual adaptation of these cell lines to increased concentrations
of the NO-ASAs.
We found E1A Msh2+/+ MEFs to be most sensitive to the growthinhibitory effects of the NO-ASAs. Maintenance of these cells in
medium containing 1 and 2.5 Amol/L of either ortho-NO-ASA or
para-NO-ASA resulted in complete cell death in 67 and 33 days,
respectively (data not shown). Moreover, cells could not be
successfully nurtured beyond these time points regardless of
altered seeding densities. In contrast, the HCT116-derived cell lines

appeared to thrive during prolonged treatment with ortho-NO-ASA
and para-NO-ASA concentrations above their 5-day IC50 values. We
found that it was possible to maintain and propagate these lines in
5 Amol/L of either ortho- or para-NO-ASA. Although an initial lag
in cell growth was observed, the HCT116-derived cells recovered
and displayed normal growth kinetics by 2 weeks of culture and
were viable for the duration of the study. The basis of this limited
drug tolerance is unknown and might be related to their tumor cell
characteristics. This observation underlines the importance of
examining relatively normal isogenic mammalian cell lines in
comparison to tumor-derived cell lines.

+ch3(hMLH+) cells are unaffected by long-term treatment with NO-ASAs. MMR-proficient HCT116(hMLH1/)+ch3(hMLH+) cells were subjected to treatment
with 5 Amol/L of ortho -NO-ASA. DNA was isolated from cells at the times indicated and amplified with (A ) marker MSM16 (AC25) and (B ) marker MSM13 (T40).
C and D, treatment of HCT116(hMLH1/) cells with ortho -NO-ASA results in selection for a cell population that displays stabilization at previously unstable
microsatellite markers. HCT116(hMLH1/) cells are MMR-deficient and are MSI. C, treatment with 5 Amol/L of ortho -NO-ASA changes the mean allele size of marker
MSM15 (AC28) from 213 to 211 bp by day 112. This shift in allele size becomes stable and does not change upon further duration of treatment. D, treatment with
5 Amol/L of ortho -NO-ASA changes the mean allele sizes of marker MSM14 (AC14). The MSM14 marker contains two alleles, which achieve stabilization independently
of each other. The smaller allele stabilizes at 106 bp by day 84, whereas the larger allele stabilized at 116 bp by day 112. Small arrowheads, positions of known
size control (bottom ); large arrowhead and dashed line, positions of major alleles (top ).

Prolonged exposure of mammalian cell lines to ASA and
NO-ASA. We treated the murine cell lines with 0.5 and 1.5 mmol/L
of ASA, 0.1 and 0.5 Amol/L of ortho-NO-ASA, 100 and 150 Amol/L of
meta-NO-ASA, and 0.1 and 0.5 Amol/L of para-NO-ASA. The only
exception to this treatment regime were E1A Msh2+/+ MEFs, which
were treated with 0.1 and 0.25 mmol/L of ASA because they proved
comparatively more sensitive to this compound than the other cell
lines. The cell lines were split at the onset of the study, considered
as day 0 (t = 0), and subjected to continual long-term cultivation.
Negative controls included cell culture in medium alone (DMEM)
and cell culture in medium plus DMSO. After t = 0, each treatment
was considered to generate separate cell lines which were analyzed
individually with six microsatellite markers (see Materials and
Methods).
Cell lines were treated with ASA and NO-ASAs for up to 156 days.
Complete MSI/MSS data for each cell line is tabulated in
Supplementary Tables S1 to S8. A central premise was that NOASA treatment would uniquely affect the microsatellite patterns of
MMR-deficient cells but not MMR-proficient cells. This prediction
was substantiated by the observation that these compounds did
not alter the microsatellite size pattern(s) of any of the MMRproficient cells examined (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Tables S1–S8).
MSI analysis suggested that the MMR-deficient murine cell lines
continue to independently evolve novel microsatellite size patterns.
For example, examination of p53/Msh2/ colonocytes at 84
days following growth in DMEM, DMSO, 100 Amol/L of meta-NOASA, and 150 Amol/L of meta-NO-ASA results in four different MSI
profiles for marker MSM01 (Fig. 3B). These cell lines originated
from a single parental cell line (day 0) that was then split and
subjected to the drug regimes. At 84 days posttreatment, the
microsatellite size patterns of all the cell lines appeared different
(Fig. 3B). These data strongly suggest independent evolution of MSI
cells.
An example of p53/Msh2/ colonocyte microsatellite sequence (MSM01) analysis over the course of treatment with
150 Amol/L of meta-NO-ASA is shown in Fig. 3C. The microsatellite
size pattern appears altered relative to its preceding pattern until
day 123. At day 123, the microsatellite size pattern appears
identical to day 84. All succeeding and redundant analyses of this
microsatellite repeat sequence from these p53/Msh2/ colonocytes treated with 150 Amol/L of meta-NO-ASA appeared
identical to day 84 (data not shown). These results are consistent
with the conclusion that long-term treatment of p53/Msh2/
colonocytes with 150 mmol/L of meta-NO-ASA induced MSS for
the MSM01 microsatellite.
The initial microsatellite size profiles of HCT116(hMLH1/),
HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr2(hMLH1), and HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr3(hMLH1+) cell lines for the six diagnostic microsatellite markers
suggests that these cell lines are not absolutely isogenic (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, numerous studies have detailed
the complementation and apparent full function of hMLH1 in the
HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr3(hMLH1+) cell line (22, 26). We observed
differences between these three cell lines in both major allele size
and the PCR stutter pattern for MSM12, MSM13, and MSM16
(Supplementary Fig. S2). This observation is best exemplified by
the MSM13 microsatellite. The HCT116(hMLH1/) tumor cell line
contained two major allele sizes of 106 and 116 bp. These sizes
should be considered relative to the consensus allele size in most
normal human tissues of 126 bp (27). This result is consistent
with the general observation of shortened allele sizes in most
MSI human tumors as well as the original HCT116(hMLH1/)

MSI tumor cell line (17, 28). The construction of the HCT116(hMLH1 /)+chr2(hMLH1 ) and HCT116(hMLH1 /)+chr3(hMLH1+) cell lines resulted in the isolation of clones from the
original HCT116(hMLH1/) parent line with additional microsatellite size differences. These included 103 and 117 bp in the
HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr2(hMLH1) cell line as well as 105 and
115 bp in the HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr3(hMLH1+) cell line (Supplementary Fig. S2). The stutter pattern also revealed qualitative
differences between these cell lines.
The microsatellite size patterns of the MMR-proficient
HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr3(hMLH1+) cell line were stable and
unaltered compared with the starting microsatellite size pattern
following treatment with ASA or NO-ASAs (Fig. 4A and B; see
Supplementary Tables S9–S12). These results are quantitatively
similar to the MMR-proficient mouse cell lines (Fig. 3; Supplementary Tables S1–S8). Examples of microsatellite size stabilization
following treatment of the MMR-deficient HCT116(hMLH1/)
cell line with ortho-NO-ASA are shown in Fig. 4C and D. We
noted the stabilization of the MSM15 allele at 211 bp by day 112
(Fig. 4C). Similarly, we noted the stabilization of the small MSM14
allele at 106 bp by day 84 and the large allele at 116 bp by day 112
(Fig. 4D). These results suggest that ASA- and NO-ASA–dependent
stabilization of MSI is allele-specific, even within a single microsatellite. We scored drug-induced MSS only when both alleles
displayed stability.
Treatment of MMR-deficient cells with ASA and NO-ASA
results in dose-dependent microsatellite stability. A complete
analysis of long-term ASA and NO-ASA exposure using the panel of
six mouse/human-specific microsatellite sequences was performed
with the E1A MEFs and p53/Msh2/ colonocytes (Fig. 5A and
B; Supplementary Tables S1–8) and the HCT116-derived human
tumor cell lines (Fig. 5C and D; Supplementary Tables S9–S12). The
data are displayed in a bar format to allow an overall view of
microsatellite marker stability compared with untreated controls
and the MMR-proficient control cell lines. We found that treatment
of the MMR-deficient cell lines with ASA and NO-ASA resulted in a
dose-dependent MSS of normally unstable microsatellite markers
(Fig. 5). The greatest stabilization following any treatment regime
was four of six microsatellite markers (67%). Dinucleotide microsatellite repeat sequences seemed to display ASA- and NO-ASA–
induced MSS to a greater extent and at earlier time points than
mononucleotide microsatellite repeat sequences. These latter
results seemed consistent with the observation that mononucleotide microsatellite repeat sequences were more prone to MSI even
in marginally MMR-deficient genetic backgrounds (23, 29, 30).
Treatment of the E1A Msh2/ MEFs and p53/Msh2/
colonocytes with 0.5 Amol/L of ortho-NO-ASA resulted in a residual
MSI of 33% (two of six) which borders on the National Cancer
Institute–recommended diagnosis of MSI (Fig. 5A and B, lane 4;
ref. 17) and is below the diagnosis of MSI derived from a large-scale
survey of microsatellite markers (28). There appeared to be no
consistent time of onset of the dose-dependent MSS of MMRdeficient cell lines. However, the earliest onset of MSS of a single
microsatellite marker occurred at 60 days posttreatment of the
E1A Msh2/ MEFs with ASA (0.5 and 1.5 mmol/L) and ortho-NOASA (0.5 Amol/L), the p53/Msh2/ colonocytes with 0.1 Amol/L
of para-NO-ASA, and the HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr2(hMLH1)
with 5.0 Amol/L of para-NO-ASA. Because these cell lines, on
average, displayed a 24-h doubling time, the number of generations
required to develop MSS appears nearly equivalent to the number
of days posttreatment. The relative suppression of MSI by ASA and

Figure 5. Dose-dependent stabilization of MSI in MMR-deficient cell lines following prolonged treatment with ASA and NO-ASA. Changes in microsatellite
patterns were assessed with six microsatellite markers for both the murine (MSM01–06) and human (MSM11–16) cell lines; designated 01-06 (TG27, TA27,
GA29, CT25/CA27, A33, T27) and 11-16 (T26, A26, T40, AC14, AC28, AC25), respectively, as indicated on far left Y -axis (see Supplementary Table S13). Changes
that result in microsatellite stability of these selected markers following long-term exposure to ASA and NO-ASAs are shown as six arbitrarily shaded bars, indicating
the observed stability of individual microsatellites. The positive controls (+) for each panel are the respective MMR-proficient cell lines: A, E1A Msh2+/+ MEFs;
B, p53/ colonocytes; C, HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr3(hMLH+); D, HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr3(hMLH+). These MMR-proficient cell lines are represented by six bars,
demonstrating the complete stability of each microsatellite studied, which remains unaltered with treatment (see Fig. 3). Conversely, the negative controls () represent
the comparable isogenic MMR-deficient cell lines treated with DMSO only: A, E1A Msh2/ MEFs; B, p53/Msh2/ colonocytes; C, HCT116(hMLH1/);
D, HCT116(hMLH1/)+chr2(hMLH1). These cell lines lack a representative bar for any of the microsatellite markers, indicating fundamental MSI that remains
unaltered over time. The treatment parameters of the MMR-deficient cell lines are keyed to the numbers on the far right Y-axis and correspond to the numbers above
each treatment day. For example, in A, E1A Msh2/ MEFs treated with 0.5 mol/L (1) and 1.5 mol/L (2) of ASA display stabilization at marker MSM01 (bottom,
black bars ) at day 60. At day 88, marker MSM02 (second, medium gray bar ), in addition to MSM01 also displays stabilization. These summarized bar data are
derived from Supplementary Tables S1–12. Numbers in parenthesis on the X-axis represent the time points at which data for meta -NO-ASA were obtained.

NO-ASA derivatives did not seem to be equivalent when cell lines
were compared (Fig. 5). However, taken as a whole, our data are
consistent with the conclusion that treatment of MMR-deficient
cells with ASA and NO-ASA leads to widespread dose-dependent
suppression of MSI. These results are qualitatively similar to
previous studies of ASA- and sulindac-treated human tumor cell
lines (19).

Discussion
We have demonstrated that continuous long-term exposure of
genetically defined MMR-deficient murine and human HNPCC cell
lines to ASA and NO-ASA positional isomers resulted in a dosedependent widespread suppression of MSI. The level of this
suppression is incomplete. However, in all cases, a minimum of
50% of the diagnostic microsatellite markers appear to be
stabilized by at least one of the NO-ASA positional isomers.
Dinucleotide microsatellite markers seem to be preferentially
stabilized compared with mononucleotide microsatellite markers.
These latter results appear consistent with genetic and biochemical
studies that have shown a preference for mononucleotide repeat
instability in cells with marginal MSI and suggests that replication
fidelity may underpin the selection of MSS cells.
MMR gene defects that have been clearly linked to widespread
MSI include hMSH2, hMSH6, hMLH1, and hPMS2 (hMLH3 remains
controversial; ref. 16). Alteration of any of these genes affects the
stability of mononucleotide, dinucleotide, and complex microsatellite sequences as well as base substitution mutations. Because
there has been no reported dissociation of MSI from base
substitution mutagenesis, we regard it likely that suppression of
MSI by ASA and NO-ASA would also result in suppression of the
widespread mutator phenotype (base substitution mutagenesis)
associated with cellular MMR defects.
Although previous studies have implicated apoptosis in ASA
selection of MSS in MMR-deficient HNPCC cells (19), the
mechanism of the NO-ASA positional isomer–selective process
for MSS is unknown. A detailed understanding of the components
associated with the induced apoptotic selection by ASA and its
functional derivatives remains enigmatic. Moreover, it is unclear
whether MSI suppression depends uniquely on the ASA moiety or
is enhanced by the NO-donating group. Because the suppression of
MSS occurs in genetic backgrounds that are deficient in hMSH2–
hMSH6 or hMLH1–hPMS2, the role of ASA and NO-ASA in MSS
selection must a priori be independent of these protein complexes.
Moreover, because there seems to be little change in doubling
times of the treated and untreated cells, it would be unlikely that
differential growth suppression could be a significant contributor

to the selective process. The existing data seems to suggest that
ASA and NO-ASA lowers the threshold for cellular damage–
induced apoptosis such that it includes postreplication mismatched nucleotides. Because the normal mismatch detection
system is defective, sensing these lesions seems to occur
independently of the fundamental MMR components. However,
we have not ruled out the possibility that suppression of MSI might
include components of the MMR-dependent damage-induced
apoptosis signaling pathway.
The murine cell lines used in this study contain deleted or
attenuated p53. In fact, the only methodology to date for the
consistent isolation of murine colonocyte epithelial cells requires
genetic deletion of p53 from the starting tissues (31). However, the
HCT116-derived human cell lines contain wild-type p53 and have
been consistently used for studies involving normal p53 function(s).
Because our results seem to be constant across several mammalian
cell lines with varying p53 status, we regard it unlikely that p53
plays a significant role in the suppression of MSI or the mechanism
that leads to this suppression. However, we cannot rule out a
competing role for p53 in the ASA/NO-ASA apoptotic selective
process because there seems to be modestly less suppression of
MSI in the HCT116-derived cell lines (p53+) compared with the
murine cell lines (p53). The suppression of MSI by ASA and NOASA positional isomers in fibroblasts, colonic epithelial cells, and
tumor cells suggests that the suppression components and/or
mechanism(s) are largely conserved across many cell types.
We find a consistent hierarchy in the suppression of MSI by
these ASA derivatives: ortho-NO-ASA  para-NO-ASA > meta-NOASA J ASA. The doses required for the ortho-NO-ASA and
para-NO-ASA to suppress MSI seem to be 10- to 100-fold less than
meta-NO-ASA and 300- to 3,000-fold less than ASA. Such reduced
doses may significantly attenuate the clinically relevant side effects
associated with ASA and sulindac. The combination of enhanced
suppression of MSI at significantly reduced dosages suggests that
the ortho- and para-NO-ASA derivatives may be useful chemopreventives for carriers of the MMR deficiency associated with
HNPCC.
