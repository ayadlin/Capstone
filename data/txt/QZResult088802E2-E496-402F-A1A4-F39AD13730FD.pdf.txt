BACKGROUND: The current study was a phase 1 clinical trial conducted with patients who had recurrent or
progressive malignant glioma (MG). The trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) and toxicity of irinotecan (CPT-11) when administered with temozolomide (TMZ) and O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG). METHODS: All 3 drugs, CPT-11, TMZ, and O6-BG, were administered on Day 1 of a 21-day treatment. First, patients were treated with a 1-hour bolus infusion of O6-BG at a dose of 120 mg/m2 followed
immediately by a 48-hour continuous infusion of O6-BG at a dose of 30 mg/m2/d. Second, within 60
minutes of the end of the 1-hour bolus infusion of O6-BG, TMZ was administered orally at a dose of 355
mg/m2. Third, 1 hour after administration of TMZ, CPT-11 was infused over 90 minutes. Patients were
accrued to 1 of 2 strata based on CYP3A1- and CYP3A4-inducing antiepileptic drug (EIAED) use; dose
escalation was conducted independently within these strata. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were enrolled. In
both strata, the dose-limiting toxicities were hematologic and included grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia. For Stratum 1 (EIAEDs), when TMZ was administered at a
dose of 355 mg/m2, the MTD of CPT-11 was determined to be 120 mg/m2. In contrast, for Stratum 2 (no
EIAEDs), when TMZ was administered at a dose of 200 mg/m2, the MTD of CPT-11 was determined to be
80 mg/m2. CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that the results of the current study provide the foundation
for a phase 2 trial of O6-BG in combination with CPT-11 and TMZ in patients with MG. Cancer

TMZ, CPT-11, and O6-BG for Recurrent MG/Quinn et al

for the treatment of malignant glioma (MG), their ability
to prolong survival is short-lived. Thus, innovative therapeutic agents and strategies are imperative.
Few would argue with the reasoning that because cytotoxic drugs when used as single agents rarely have a
major therapeutic impact, combination treatment should
be developed. Thus, the rationale for the combination of
TMZ, irinotecan (CPT-11), and O6-benzylguanine (O6BG) is based on 5 factors. First, TMZ and CPT-11 each
have demonstrated clinical activity when administered
separately to patients with MG. In a multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial, the addition of TMZ to radiotherapy
for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma resulted in
a statistically significant survival benefit.1 These results
were supported by earlier studies indicating that TMZ
was active in patients with recurrent MG.2,3 Although
CPT-11 has demonstrated some activity in MG, the magnitude of this activity remains unclear. In phase 2 MG trials, the response rates for CPT-11 were reported to range
from 2.2% to 44%.4-8 The variability in response rates
can be explained by the variability in the following: 1)
population (pediatrics vs adults), 2) interpatient pharmacokinetics (CYP3A1- and CYP3A4-inducing antiepileptic
drugs [EIAEDs]), 3) extent of prior therapy (newly diagnosed vs recurrent), and 3) dosing regimen (every 3 weeks
vs weekly for the first 4 of 6 weeks).
Second, TMZ and CPT-11 are ideal candidates for
combination chemotherapy, because they exert their antitumor effects through interactions with different targets
and have different organ toxicities. CPT-11 is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that stabilizes the covalent bond between
topoisomerase I and DNA, a bond formed during synthesis of new DNA, thereby inhibiting the religation and ultimately leading to cell death.9 The dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT) of CPT-11 is diarrhea.10,11 TMZ is an alkylating
agent that transfers a methyl group to 3 sites: N7-guanine,
N3-adenine, and O6-guanine.12 The toxic lesion is
believed to be the O6-guanine adduct, which leads to a
lethal cycle of DNA mismatch repair if the adduct is not
removed by the DNA repair protein, O6-alkylguanineDNA alkyltransferase (AGT). The DLT of TMZ is
myelosuppression.13
Third, TMZ given in combination with CPT-11
demonstrates enhanced antitumor activity compared with
the 2 agents used alone. Houghton et al14 first discovered
that the activity of the combination of CPT-11 and TMZ
Cancer

in glioblastoma xenografts was significantly greater than
the activity of either agent administered alone. Patel
et al15 confirmed this synergistic activity and went on to
demonstrate that this activity was schedule dependent.
When TMZ preceded CPT-11, a substantial increase in
antitumor activity was noted compared with the response
to the agents used alone. However, when CPT-11 preceded TMZ, a dramatic decrease in this enhanced activity
was observed. The mechanism of this enhanced activity
was elucidated by Pourquier et al16 when he demonstrated
in vitro and in N-methyl-N’-nitrosoguanidine–treated
Chinese hamster ovary cells that O6 alkylation of guanine
induces topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes,
thereby decreasing the topoisomerase I-mediated DNA
religation.
Fourth, AGT appears to be a major mechanism of
resistance to TMZ. An inverse relation between AGT levels and response was noted in patients with MG who were
treated with preradiation TMZ.17 Furthermore, Hegi
et al18 have demonstrated a correlation between inactivation of the AGT gene by promoter methylation and survival in patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated with
surgery, radiotherapy, and TMZ. To our knowledge, no
clinical trials have been performed to date to elucidate the
relation between AGT levels and CPT-11 efficacy in MG
patients, despite marginal preclinical studies purporting a
correlation between AGT and CPT-11.19-21 Accordingly,
no CPT-11 dose modifications based on AGT were performed. These studies suggest that the efficacy of TMZ
but not necessarily CPT-11 could be enhanced by depletion of tumor AGT by O6-BG.
Fifth, the addition of O6-BG to the combination of
TMZ and CPT-11 was found to dramatically increase the
growth delay of AGT-positive D-456 MG xenografts
compared with the growth delay in these xenografts after
the administration of either agent alone or in combination.22 These 5 factors suggest that the combination of
TMZ, O6-BG, and CPT-11 may be a highly effective
clinical intervention.
In the current study, we report a phase 1 clinical trial
in patients with recurrent or progressive MG. This trial
was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) and DLT of CPT-11 when administered after
TMZ and O6-BG. The secondary objectives were to further define the toxicity of this regimen and to evaluate for
antitumor activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eligible patients had a histologically confirmed diagnosis
of progressive or recurrent primary MG (glioblastoma
multiforme, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma). Patients were aged 18 years and required to
have Karnofsky performance score 60%. Patients must
have had measurable disease on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An interval of at least 2
weeks since prior surgical resection or 6 weeks since prior
chemotherapy or radiotherapy had to have elapsed for the
patient to be enrolled into the clinical trial. Additional
enrollment criteria included adequate pretreatment bone
marrow function (hemoglobin 10 g/dL, total granulocyte count 1500 cells/lL, and platelet count 100,000
cells/lL), renal function (blood urea nitrogen and serum
creatinine <1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]),
and hepatic function (total serum bilirubin <1.5 times
ULN, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase <2.5 times ULN, and alkaline phosphatase <2
times ULN). Patients of reproductive potential were
required to take effective contraceptive measures for the
duration of the study. The protocol was reviewed and
approved by the Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board. Each patient signed an informed
consent form.
The following patients were excluded from the
study: patients who had previously failed CPT-11, nursing or pregnant women, potentially fertile women or men
who were not using an effective contraception method,
patients with a previous active malignancy treated within
the past year, patients taking immunosuppressive agents
other than corticosteroids, patients with active infection
requiring intravenous antibiotics, patients with known
human immunodeficiency virus infection, or those experiencing frequent vomiting or a medical condition that
could interfere with oral medication intake.

including phenytoin, carbamazapine, phenobarbital,
oxcarbazepine, and primidone.4,6,8 Therefore, patients
were accrued independently into each stratum. Stratum
1 was comprised of patients receiving EIAEDs and
Stratum 2 was comprised of patients not receiving
EIAEDs.
All 3 drugs, TMZ, O6-BG, and CPT-11, were
administered on Day 1 of a 21-day treatment cycle until
unacceptable toxicity or tumor progression occurred.
First, patients were treated with a 1-hour bolus infusion of
O6-BG at a dose of 120 mg/m2 followed immediately by
a 48-hour continuous infusion of O6-BG at a dose of 30
mg/m2/day, based on the desire to prevent regeneration of
AGT and removal of O6 methyl adducts before futile
rounds of DNA mismatch repair lead to cell death.23
CPT-11 is not affected by AGT, and no timing considerations with O6-BG were necessary for this agent. Second,
within 60 minutes of the end of the 1-hour bolus infusion
of O6-BG, TMZ was administered orally at a dose of 355
mg/m2, which represents a 1-level reduction from the single-dose MTD of TMZ when given in combination with
O6-BG.23 Third, 1 hour after TMZ administration,
CPT-11 was infused over 90 minutes.
Dose escalation for CPT-11 for Stratum 1 was as
follows: 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, and 270 mg/
m2. Dose escalation for CPT-11 for Stratum 2 was as follows: 40, 60, 80, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 mg/m2. If
the first dose level of CPT-11 exceeded the MTD, the
dose of TMZ for the next cohort of patients was reduced
to 267 mg/m2. If this dose of TMZ plus the first dose level
of CPT-11 still exceeded the MTD, the TMZ dose was
reduced for the next cohort of patients to 200 mg/m2. If
this dose of TMZ (200 mg/m2) in combination with the
first dose level of CPT-11 exceeded the MTD, the study
was to be closed.
O6-BG was supplied by AOI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(New York, NY). TMZ was commercially available from
Schering-Plough Research Institute (Kenilworth, NJ).
CPT-11 was commercially available from Pfizer Pharmaceuticals (New York, NY).

Study Design and Treatment
This was a phase 1, open-label, single-center trial with
accrual goals defined within 2 separate strata. Previous
studies confirmed that the metabolism of CPT-11 is
significantly enhanced by concurrent use of EIAEDs,
2966

Surveillance and Follow-up
The baseline examination included central review of tumor tissue, MRI or computed tomography (CT) (if MRI
was medically contraindicated), complete blood counts

and blood chemistry tests, and a physical examination
including a comprehensive neurologic examination. During therapy, complete blood counts and blood chemistry
tests were obtained weekly. Before subsequent cycles of
chemotherapy, patients were required to repeat the complete blood count and blood chemistry tests and the physical and neurologic examination. In addition, after every 2
cycles of chemotherapy, patients were required to obtain
repeat neuroimaging.
Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).
Repeat cycles of chemotherapy were administered on
schedule only if the patient met the following retreatment
criteria: total granulocyte count >1000 cells/lL, platelet
count >100,000/lL, hemoglobin >10 g/dL, aspartate
aminotransferase 2.5 times ULN, creatinine <1.5 times
ULN, and total bilirubin within normal limits; all other
toxicities must have resolved to baseline or grade 1. The
CPT-11 dose was reduced by 20% in any patient with
grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity that was felt to be
probably or definitely related to the administration of
CPT-11.
Objective assessments of overall response were based
on tumor assessment from MRI scans (or CT if MRI was
medically contraindicated) interpreted in the light of corticosteroid use, as suggested by Macdonald et al,24 with
appropriate support from the neurologic examination.
Thus, complete response was considered to be the disappearance of all enhancing tumor on consecutive MRI
scans at least 1 month apart and no corticosteroid use
except for physiologic doses. Partial response was classified as a 50% reduction in contrast enhancement for
lesions on consecutive MRI scans at least 1 month apart,
and at least stable corticosteroid use, with stable or
improved neurologic condition. Progressive disease was
considered to be a 25% increase in contrast enhancement of any lesion or any new enhancing tumor on MRI
scans, and stable or increased corticosteroid use, with or
without neurologic progression. Stable disease was considered in all other situations.

Statistical Analysis
In establishing the optimal CPT-11 dose when combined
with TMZ and O6-BG, a modified classic ‘‘3 þ 3’’ dose
escalation design was used, which permitted up to 3 addiCancer

tional patients to be accrued at a given dose level as long as
none of the first 3 patients enrolled at that dose level experienced a DLT. The dose level was escalated in successive
cohorts of 3 patients as long as no DLT was observed. If 1
instance of DLT was observed among the initial 3 assessable patients at any dose level, an additional 3 patients
had to be treated at that dose level with no further DLT
for dose escalation to proceed. If 2 instances of DLT were
observed at a dose level, the MTD was determined to be
surpassed, and a total of 6 patients were treated at the previous level to ensure its tolerability. The MTD was therefore the highest dose level at which DLT was experienced
by no more than 1 of 6 patients. Any patient who had stable or responding disease who developed DLT could continue to be treated at the next lowest dose level, provided
the patient’s toxicity resolved to grade 1 or lower and no
more than 2 weeks were required for recovery. However,
the patient was removed from study if DLT occurred at
the lower dose.

RESULTS
Patient Data
A total of 55 patients with recurrent MG were enrolled at
Duke University Medical Center between July 2003 and
March 2005. Demographic and clinical characteristics of
patients are detailed in Table 1.

Toxicity Evaluation
Table 2 summarizes the frequency and type of DLT
observed at each dose level per stratum. For Stratum 1
(EIAEDs), DLT was not observed until the dose of CPT11 was escalated to 120 mg/m2. One patient experienced
a DLT of grade 4 neutropenia at this dose. Once the
CPT-11 dose was escalated to 150 mg/m2, 2 patients
experienced a DLT, 1 with grade 4 neutropenia and the
other with grade 4 leukopenia. For Stratum 1, when
TMZ was administered at a dose of 355 mg/m2, the
MTD of CPT-11 was determined to be 120 mg/m2. In
contrast, for Stratum 2 (no EIAEDs), 3 patients experienced DLTs at the initial CPT-11 dose of 40 mg/m2. At
this dose level, 2 patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia
with grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and 1 patient experienced grade 4 neutropenia. Subsequently, the TMZ dose

was de-escalated, first to 267 mg/m2 and then ultimately
to 200 mg/m2 after 2 patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia at a dose of 267 mg/m2. Once the dose of TMZ was
established at 200 mg/m2, the CPT-11 dose was escalated
to 60 mg/m2 and then to 80 mg/m2 with 1 DLT of grade
4 neutropenia experienced at each dose level. The last
dose escalation of CPT-11, to 100 mg/m2, proved to be
too toxic, with 2 DLT events of grade 4 febrile neutropenia and grade 4 neutropenia with grade 4 thrombocytopenia. For Stratum 2, when TMZ was administered at
200 mg/ m2, the MTD of CPT-11 was determined to be
80 mg/m2.
Seven patients were not evaluable for DLTs (Table
2). Two patients received filgrastim by home physician
intervention for grade 3 neutropenia before the absolute
neutrophil count nadir was reached. Another patient did
not obtain laboratory findings during Cycle 1, although
they went on to receive a total of 17 cycles without experiencing toxicities. Three patients died of disease progression, which was verified on MRI: 2 patients on Day 11
and 1 patient on Day 19 of their first cycle. On Day 19 of
the first cycle, 1 patient died suddenly after experiencing
signs and symptoms suspicious for pulmonary embolism,
which was not verified by autopsy.

Seven patients died while participating in this study.
Three patients died of disease progression from cerebral
herniation during their first cycle of therapy. The other 4
patients died of adverse events that were not dose-limiting. Two patients experienced signs and symptoms consistent with pulmonary embolism and died suddenly, 1
during the first cycle and 1 during the fourth cycle. One
patient died of an intracranial hemorrhage during the second cycle of therapy, despite no evidence of thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy. One patient died during the
seventh cycle of therapy after presenting to medical attention with pneumonia and sepsis with positive blood cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa accompanied by grade 4
leukopenia and grade 3 thrombocytopenia.

Response
There were 53 of the 55 patients evaluable for response by
MRI. All had developed disease progression at the time of
last follow-up. Although it was not a response study, there
were no reports of any patients who had an objective
response (>50% decrease in size of tumor). The median
progression-free survival (PFS) time measured by the
Kaplan-Meier technique from the date of initiation of
therapy was 6.4 weeks (95% confidence interval, 6 weeks7.71 weeks). Seventeen patients were progression free for
13 weeks, and 2 patients (both with glioblastoma multiforme [GBM]) were progression free for 6 months.
These results are difficult to compare with the literature,
because typically there are limited summaries of response
rates in phase 1 studies. Nevertheless, a review of 6-month
PFS in adults with recurrent grade 4 (9 weeks) and grade
3 glioma (13 weeks) has been reported.25 Unfortunately,
it is impossible to meaningfully relate these results to those
in our phase 1 trial.

DISCUSSION
The goal of the current study was to define the MTD and
DLT of CPT-11 when administered after TMZ and O6BG once every 3 weeks to patients receiving and not
receiving EIAEDs. In the current phase 1 trial for Stratum
1 (EIAEDs), when TMZ was administered at a dose of
355 mg/m2, the MTD of CPT-11 was determined to be
120 mg/m2. In contrast, for Stratum 2 (no EIAEDs),
when TMZ was administered at a dose of 200 mg/m2, the
Cancer

July 1, 2009

MTD of CPT-11 was determined to be 80 mg/m2. The
DLTs were hematologic and included grade 4 neutropenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 in these 2 strata were not evaluated,
but the available literature is clear regarding the reduced
levels of CPT-11 and SN-38 noted in patients receiving
EIAEDs.6
The rationale for using a frequency of once every 3
weeks in the dosing regimen for TMZ, CPT-11, and O6BG is based on several factors. First, of the 2 competing
dosing regimens of CPT-11 (once every 3 weeks vs weekly
for the first 4 of 6 weeks), neither has proven to be more
efficacious or less toxic than the other. In prior phase 1
and 2 MG trials using CPT-11, the variability in population, interpatient pharmacokinetics, dosing regimen, and
extent of prior therapy makes drawing any conclusions as
to a preferred CPT-11 dosing regimen difficult, if not
impossible.
Second, the schedule-dependent enhancement of
antitumor activity observed in preclinical studies made it
necessary to administer TMZ before but within 5 days of
CPT-11. This requirement persuaded us to choose the
once-every-3-weeks dosing regimen, because we had no
prior experience in administering TMZ in combination
with O6-BG on a weekly basis. Because our prior phase 1
and 2 trials of TMZ plus O6-BG used a 28-day cycle
length for drug administration, a modification in cycle
length from 28 to 21 days was believed to be safe, along
with, as detailed earlier, a concomitant dose reduction of
TMZ from 472 mg/m2 to 355 mg/m2. In our present
study, it is unclear whether the reduction in cycle length
of TMZ plus O6-BG from 28 to 21 days or the addition
of CPT-11 necessitated the eventual dose reduction in
TMZ to 200 mg/m2 in those who did not require
EIAEDs. Despite this TMZ dose reduction, 12 patients
who received no EIAEDs demonstrated stable disease for
4 to 18 cycles.
The current study describes a phase 1 trial combining CPT-11 plus TMZ plus O6-BG and demonstrates
that these drugs can be safely administered together in a
once-every-3-weeks dosing regimen, with and without
EIAED. This was a phase 1 trial, and the primary endpoint was not response. Nevertheless, the lack of any
responses was disheartening, and it is possible that the
final MTDs represent subtherapeutic doses or that the
timing of administered doses did not maximize

therapeutic benefit. These questions can only be answered
in a future phase 2 trial using this combination of drugs.
