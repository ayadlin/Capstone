ABSTRACT
Kindlin-3 (FERMT-3) is known to be central in hemostasis and thrombosis control
and its deficiency disrupts platelet aggregation and causes Leukocyte Adhesion
Deficiency disease. Here we report that Kindlin-3 has a tumor suppressive role in solid
cancer. Our present genetic and functional data show that Kindlin-3 is downregulated
in several solid tumors by a mechanism involving gene hypermethylation and
deletions. In vivo experiments demonstrated that Kindlin-3 knockdown in 2 tumor
cell models (breast cancer and melanoma) markedly increases metastasis formation,
in accord with the in vitro increase of tumor cell malignant properties. The metastatic
phenotype was supported by a mechanism involving alteration in β3-integrin activation
including decreased phosphorylation, interaction with talin and the internalization of
its active form leading to less cell attachment and more migration/invasion. These
data uncover a novel and unexpected tumor suppressor role of Kindin-3 which can
influence integrins targeted therapies development.

INTRODUCTION

different genes, KIND1 (FERMT1, chromosome
20p12.3), KIND2 (FERMT2, chromosome 14q22.1),
KIND3 (FERMT3, chromosome 11q13.1). Kindlins
are characterized by a C-terminal domain FERM (4.1
protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin) which is bisected by a
pleckstrin homology domain [1-4]. Kindlins can bind

Kindlin-3 (Mig2B, FERMT-3), a key integrin
activating protein belongs to the Kindlin family which
includes three members that share considerable sequence
and structural homologies. They are encoded by three

directly to various classes of integrins and participate in
their activation, thus playing a key role in the regulation
of cell-matrix junctions, such as focal adhesions, as well as
cell-cell contacts. Kindlin-3 has been mainly described in
hematopoietic cells and appears to be central in the control
of hemostasis and thrombosis [5, 6]. It has been implicated
in β2 integrin activation in leukocytes and was shown to
promote their adhesion and endothelial transmigration [5].
Point mutations in the kindlin-3 gene have been identified
in humans with a rare inherited Integrin Activation
Deficiency Disease (IADD), also designated as Leukocyte
Adhesion Deficiency syndrome (LAD-III or LADI
variant). The manifestations of the Kindlin-3 deficiency
include episodic bleeding, susceptibility to frequent
infections and osteopetrosis which result from an inability
to activate β1, β2 and β3 integrins [5, 7-10]. A recent study
reported that Kindlin-3 is also expressed in endothelial
cells and contributes to their integrin-mediated adhesion
[11]. Kindlin-3 knockdown in endothelial cells results
in impaired adhesion to integrin substrates, despite the
presence of Kindlin 2 in these cells suggesting different
roles for these Kindlin members in integrin signaling [11].
While Kindlin-3 expression is restricted to cells
of hematopoietic origin, Kindlin-1 is predominantly
expressed in epithelial cells in tissues such as skin,
intestine and kidney and Kindkin-2 is expressed in most
tissues but mainly in skeletal and smooth muscle cells
[4]. All three proteins are localized to integrin-dependent
adhesion sites.
Integrins play key roles in cell adhesion by providing
a physical connection between the extracellular matrix and
the cytoskeleton. They have also been shown to regulate
intracellular signaling processes involved in migration,
invasion, proliferation, differentiation, and survival of
normal and tumor cells [12-14]. In particular, integrin β3
has been suggested to have prominent functions in cancer
biology, its expression in tumor tissue correlates with
tumor progression and it was shown to contribute to the
metastasis of different cancer types [15-18]. Integrins exist
in two main conformational states, upon ligand binding
and cellular stimulation, integrins are activated by shifting
from a low affinity to a high affinity state and this was
shown to require the binding of several adaptor proteins
to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin. It is now widely
accepted that both of the cytoplasmic proteins kindlins and
talins are critical for integrin activation through binding to
the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin subunit [4].
Talin-mediated integrin activation was suggested
to play a role in tumor progression and talin expression
was shown to increase significantly in certain cancers
and to correlate with progression to the metastatic
disease [19]. Both kindlin-1 and kindlin-2, apart from
their implication in inherited disease, have also been
reported to be deregulated in certain human cancers [20].
However, the role of Kindlin-3 in solid tumors has not
yet been explored, probably because it was thought to be
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

only expressed by hematopoietic cells. Since our initial
studies detected Kindlin-3 expression in several cell and
tissue types, albeit in lower levels than in platelets and
leukocytes, and in view of its ability to crosstalk with
integrins, having crucial role in tumorigenesis [21] we
hypothesized that Kindlin-3 could play a role in cancer.

RESULTS
Kindlin-3 is down-expressed in human tumors
We analyzed the expression of Kindlin-3 mRNA and
protein in several tumor types including melanoma, breast,
lung and kidney cancers and observed that Kindlin-3
was significantly downregulated in these tumors when
compared with the normal tissue counterparts (Figure
1A). Histological examination of the tumor samples
confirmed the predominance of malignant cells (> 80%),
suggesting that the Kindlin-3 mRNA expression is mostly
from tumor cell origin. Kindlin-3 transcript levels in
breast cancer (n=129) were 5 fold lower than in normal
breast tissues (n=23) (P< .001, Student t test). A similar
profile was observed in a series of kidney cancer tissues
(n=15 cancer vs 11 normals; P< .05). Kindlin-3 levels in
nevi (n=11), benign cutaneous melanocytic proliferations
which can sometimes progress to melanoma, was lower
than in normal skin (n=17) but significantly higher than in
melanoma lesions (n=71) (P< .05). Ten out of 18 matched
pairs of lung cancer and normal tissues, derived from the
same patients at a distance from the tumor, had Kindlin-3
transcriptionally down-regulated in the cancer tissues.
These expression data were confirmed by the histological
analysis using specific anti-Kindlin-3 antibodies which
do not recognize Kindlin-1 or Kindlin-2 (Figure 1BC). Furthermore a significant correlation was observed
between Kindlin-3 transcript and protein expression
when examined in a series of 18 tumors (Spearman r =
0.62 P<0.05). Taken together, these results suggest that
Kindlin-3 downregulation may be a common phenomenon
in solid cancers. This assertion is further supported by
the decreased expression of Kindlin-3 described in the
Oncomine microarray database for lung, colon cancers and
melanoma totaling 424 individual cases (Supplementary
Figure 1).

Kindlin-3 gene regulation in human tumors
Promoter methylation is one of the pivotal
mechanisms which contribute to gene silencing in tumor
progression. The methylation status of three regions
of potential interest in the kindlin-3 gene, including
two CpG islands as well as the TSS (transcription start
site), was investigated by serial pyrosequencing on
bisulfite-treated DNA obtained from breast, melanoma

We next examined whether deletions in Kindlin-3
gene may also contribute to its silencing. Preliminary
screening for potential deletions in kindlin-3 gene (11q13.1
loci), using Agilent CGH 180K array containing two
Kindlin-3 specific probes revealed a genomic loss in 2/8
melanoma tissues. Similar frequency of focal deletion was
obtained for the tumor suppressor CDKN2A (p16). This
analysis was then extended to a wider series of tumors
using a more detailed mapping approach with genomic

and lung cancer tissues and the corresponding nonneoplastic tissues. Kindlin-3 promoter was significantly
hypermethylated at the TSS (Fig. 2A) as well as in the first
intron (supplementary Figure 2a) in most cancer samples
analysed (breast cancer vs normal breast P=0.0006 and
0.02; melanoma vs nevi P=0.0055 and 0.03 respectively).
High methylation levels of Kindlin-3 in these regions were
also observed in most cultured tumor cells (melanoma,
breast and lung cell lines) (Supplementary Figure 2b).

using the Abcam anti-Kindlin-3 Ab. Note that staining is always lower in the corresponding cancer tissues. Scale bar = 20µm. C. Specificity
of the anti-Kindlin-3 antibodies used Western blot analyses of N-terminal GST-tagged recombinant Kindlin-1 (300ng), Kindlin-2 (300ng)
or Kindlin-3 (150ng) proteins (H00055612-P01, H00010979-P01, H00083706-P01; Novus Biologicals Cambridge, UK). Blots were probed
with 2 different kindlin-3 antibodies (upper panels) or GST antibody; Millipore) (lower panels). A single band corresponding to GST-tagged
Kindlin-3 was obtained with both antibodies used, ab68040 (Abcam, Cambridge MA, USA) and the custom made anti-Kindlin-3 antibody
produced against a human Kindlin-3 specific peptide corresponding to amino acids 19 –31 (RVFVGEEDPEAES) and affinity purified on
a sepharose matrix (Genosphere, France). Importantly, neither of the two antibodies recognized GST tagged Kindlin-1 or Kindlin-2 even
when 2x quantity of these recombinant proteins was loaded.

DNA (gDNA) quantification PCR (qPCR). Tumor specific
Kindlin-3 gene deletion was found in 7/19 melanoma;
2/8 breast cancer and 4/5 renal cell carcinoma analysed
by copy number loss, relative to normal peripheral
mononuclear cells (PMN) for diploid gDNA, producing
either 1 or 2 fold decrease (corresponding to heterozygous
or homozygous deletions) (Figure 2B). These findings
were strengthened by The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset
(TCGA) showing, in various subtypes of cancer, up to
12% of cases with homozygous deletion of chromosome
region 11q13.1, including Kindlin-3 gene (Supplementary
Table-1) [22-25]. Interestingly, the CGH data retrieved
from the Progenetix database showed a 33% recurring
deletions this region in a cohort of 83 primary melanomas
[26, 27].

The down regulation of Kindlin-3 in malignant
tumors suggested that Kindlin-3 plays a role in controlling
the malignant phenotype. To test this possibility, we
modulated Kindlin-3 expression in non-malignant
(normal melanocytes: Melan-a) and malignant (melanoma
SKMEL28 and breast cancer MDA-MB231) cell lines
and tested the cells in various relevant assays. As shown
in Figure 3a-e, increasing Kindlin-3 expression in
SKMEL28 and MDA-MB231 cells significantly increased
cell adhesion to collagen I, III and fibronectin and,
consistently, induced a decrease in their migratory and
invasive activities. In contrast, knockdown of Kindlin-3
in Melan-a cells decreased cell adhesion and increased
migration and invasion, thus bringing their phenotype

closer to that of the tumor cells (Figure 4A a). Similar to
the effect of Kindlin-3 downregulation in Melan-a cells,
further knockdown of Kindlin-3 in SKMEL28 and MDAMB231 cells also decreased cell adhesion and increased
migration and invasion (Figure 4A b-e). This was also
illustrated by live cell imaging (supplementary movies
1-4), which demonstrated a more disorganized stressfiber structures and exhibiting abundant filopodia (arrows;
actin in red, Figure 4B and movies 1&2) in the direction
of migration compared to control cells which appeared to
be more adherent. Interestingly, knockdown of Kindlin-3
in SKMEL28 and MDA-MB231 cells also enhanced their
proliferation rate and their ability to exhibit anchorage

independent growth (Figure 4C). Similar results were
obtained with A549 lung cancer and M10 melanoma cell
lines. Noteworthy, transcript quantification confirmed that
the knockdown of Kindlin-3 was specific as the expression
of Kindlin-1 and Kindlin-2 was not affected (Figure 4C c).
Gene expression analyses of a set of genes involved
in cell cycle, adhesion, migration and invasion, in
SKMEL28 and MDA-MB231 cells with downregulated
Kindlin-3 expression, demonstrated altered levels of
MMP-2, TIMP-1, CDK4, CDK6, and Ki-67 mRNAs, as
shown in the table of Figure 5a. In addition, human kinase
phosphorylation profile showed increased phosphorylation
of FAK, paxillin, and PYK2 (Figure 5b). Taken together,

a period of 11hr. Scale bar = 50 μm. Migrating cells were more often seen in Kindlin-3 siRNA cells with densely packed actin stress fibers
and induction of filopodia formation in the direction of migration (arrows). Note that the filopodia seen on the left side of the cell at 2hr is
no longer seen at 4hr (arrows), and that the cell moved to the right of the field at 11hr. Also, stress fibers appear disorganized, in particular
at the later time points. By contrast, in control, more cells were engaged in adhesion process displaying a normal distribution of filamentous

cell lines, using an in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA),
which detects protein-protein interactions. As shown in
Fig. 6A, Kindlin-3 was found to interact with integrins
β3, β1, and β5 in SKMEL28 and MDA-MB231 cells,
as illustrated by the appearance of fluorescent spots,
which were abolished after transfection of the cells
with Kindlin-3 siRNA. Moreover, Kindlin-3 siRNA
administration to SKMEL28 and MDA-MB231 cells
reduced the formation of talin-integrin complexes (Figure
6C) necessary for integrin activation [28]. Consistently,
the activation status of integrin β3 was reduced, as

determined by an antibody recognizing phosphorylated
tyrosine 785 (Figure 6B). This tyrosine is located in the
membrane distal tail region NxxY of integrin 1, 2 and 3 to
which Kindlin-3 directly binds [29].
Furthermore, adhesion assays where cells were
allowed to adhere for 45min and then examined using
confocal microscopy after 1hr incubation with PAC1:FITC antibody, demonstrate that the strong membrane
localization of PAC-1 antibody in control tumor cells. This
antibody which binds specifically to the activated form
of β3-integrin, appeared intracellularly in the Kindlin-3

knockdown cells (Figure 6B-D) [30, 31]. PAC-1, which
was mainly studied in platelets, has also been used to study
the active form of β3 in tumor cells such as melanoma [32,
33]. Thus, these data suggest that Kindlin-3 mediates talindependent integrin activation, at least in part, through the
regulation of integrin activation and internalization, with
consequences on cell attachment and migration [34, 35].

later, for tumor growth and development of spontaneous
metastases. SKMEL28 xenografts analysis showed that
downregulation of Kindlin-3, significantly increased
tumor growth (2.27 ± 0.39 vs 1.27± 0.19 cm3; P=0.036),
(Figure 7A b). The decrease in Kindlin-3 protein
expression within the subcutaneous tumors was confirmed
by immunohistochemical analyses of the tumor sections
(Figure 7A c) and by transcript quantification, which also
show that Kindlin-3shRNA did not alter the expression
of Kindlin-1 and Kindlin-2 in the tumor (Figure 7A d).
Histological analyses of the lung tissues also revealed that
reduced levels of Kindlin-3 expression correlated with
enhanced formation of lung metastatic foci in 7/10 mice
inoculated with Kindlin-3 shRNA-expressing SKMEL28
cells. In contrast, no metastases were detected in lungs of
mice receiving control SKMEL28 cells (Fig. 7B). In order
to verify whether these in vivo results are not limited to
the SKMEL28 cells, the effect of Kindlin-3 silencing on
metastasis was also investigated on the breast tumor model

did not affect the expression of either Kindlin-1
or Kindlin-2 and was associated with an increased

metastatic foci were much greater in the shRNA-Kindlin-3
mice (Figure 7C immunofluoresence), the increased
number of foci was only statistically different in the liver
and lymph nodes (P<0.05 for both).
In agreement with the in vitro data, Kindlin-3
silencing in vivo also decreased integrin β3
phosphorylation at Tyr785 and consistently disrupted talin/
integrin β3 interaction in SKMEL28 tumors (Figure 7D).
Collectively, these data demonstrates a suppressive role of
Kindlin-3 in tumor growth and metastasis that is mediated
in part by its ability to regulate integrin β3 activation.

triggered signaling pathways by dephosphorylating focal
adhesion kinase (FAK), resulting in inhibition of integrinmediated cell spreading, migration, and invasion [37].
The two other members of the Kindlin family,
Kindlin 1 and Kindlin-2 have already been reported to
be deregulated in solid tumors, more often upregulated.
Kindlin-1, but not Kindlin-2 or Kindlin-3 was upregulated
in colorectal and lung tumors [38]. Kindlin-1 levels were
also associated with increased lung metastasis in breast
cancer [20]. Kindlin-2 was overexpressed in gastric cancer
and was correlated with poor prognosis [39]. It was also
increased in malignant mesothelioma [40]. However,
a suppressive role of Kindlin-2 in mesenchymal cancer
cell invasion was also reported as high levels of Kindlin-2
were associated with a decrease in the invasion potential
[41]. The functional consequences of the down regulation
of Kindlin-3 in tumor cells demonstrated in our study also
suggest that Kindlin-2 and Kindlin-3 play a different and
therefore non-redundant role in cancer.
The mechanism of how Kindlin-2 and Kindlin-3
play opposing roles in tumor suppression is not clear
since the literature suggests that both interact with similar
residues of beta integrin subunits. However, Bialkowska
et al. [11] have shown nevertheless that the recognition
of integrin by these 2 Kindlins, -2 and -3 is not identical.
These may suggest that the different kindlins may play
different function in cancer. Kindlin-2 is expressed
at higher levels than Kindlin-3 in most cells and it is
possible that a critical concentration of this Kindlin is
necessary for optimal function. Indeed, a suppressive role
of Kindlin-2 in mesenchymal cancer cell invasion was
also reported as high levels of Kindlin-2 were associated
with a decrease in the invasion potential [41]. In this
context, a very recent report by Plow’s group [42], linked
Kindlin-3 overexpression in breast tumor cells to increased
metastasis. These studies, together with our present results,
highlight the complex role of Kindlin members which
could exhibit dual effects. Future investigations will no
doubt shed light on the mechanisms involved.

DISCUSSION
The results of the present study are consistent with
a tumor suppressive role for the Kindlin-3 gene, which
we have shown here to be downregulated in several
tumor types namely melanoma, breast and lung cancers,
through hypermethylation and deletions. Furthermore, our
experimental data in mice suggest that downregulation
of Kindlin-3 enhances metastasis formation. Indeed, in
SKMEL28, cells known to be poorly metastatic, most of
the mice with xenografted with shRNA Kindlin-3 cells
displayed lung metastases. When xenografted with shRNA
Kindlin-3 MDA-MB-231 cells (known to metastasize
in nude mice), the increase in metastasis formation was
observed in several organs including liver, lymph nodes
and lung. However, in this model we did not observe a
significant effect on tumor growth at the time of sacrifice.
These in vivo studies illustrate that Kindlin-3 plays a more
important role in the metastatic process. Based on our in
vitro data, the anti-metastatic effect of Kindlin-3 is likely
to be derived from its ability to regulate cell adhesion,
migration and invasion, which are known to be cellular
activities that play key roles in the dissemination of tumor
cells.
Our mechanistic in vitro and in vivo data suggest
that the changes in the adhesive and migratory properties
of tumor cells result from Kindlin-3-mediated regulation
of integrin β3 function. This is based on the demonstration
that upon Kindlin-3 silencing, both the phosphorylation
and interactions with talin of integrin β3 were significantly
reduced. Indeed, the specific binding to the cytoplasmic
tail of integrin’s β subunit by the intracellular protein talin
has been suggested to be a key step of inside-out signaling
[28, 36]. Consistently, these effects were associated with
enhanced internalization of the integrin β3 active form, a
process known to result in reduced cell attachment and
enhanced migration, two cellular activities that contribute
to the metastatic phenotype [34, 35]. These findings are
compatible with a model by which Kindlin-3 suppresses
malignant properties of cancer cells by interfering with
integrin function. This action of Kindlin-3 is similar to
that displayed by PTEN, a known tumor suppressor gene,
which has also been shown to antagonize interactions
of integrins with the extracellular matrix and integrinwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Kindlin-3 is known as a LAD-III causing gene. Its
somatic alterations in cancer suggest that physiological
outcomes depend on cellular context. This was also
described for the tumor suppressor genes PTEN and ATM,
whose inactivation also leads to neuronal loss when the
mutations are in the germline [43, 44]. Kindlin-3 germline
mutations have not yet been shown to predispose LADIII patients to cancer. It is tempting to speculate that
any cancer promoting advantage brought by Kindlin-3
germline inactivation may be counterbalanced by the
associated defects in tumor promoting thrombosis [45] and
inflammation [46] caused by these mutations.
In summary, this study is, as far as we know, the
first demonstration of a putative tumor suppressor role
of Kindlin-3 in solid human tumors that is mediated in
part by dysregulation of integrin function. These findings

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and cell lines.

Immunohistochemistry
Patients

Tumor
sections
were
analyzed
by
immunohistochemical staining using 2 different antibodies
directed against Kindlin-3, Abcam ab68040 [49] and
anti-Kindlin-3 antibody produced against a human
kindlin-3 specific peptide corresponding to amino acids
19 –31 (RVFVGEEDPEAES) and affinity purified on a
sepharose matrix; Genosphere France (Figure 1C) [50].
Both antibodies are specific to Kindlin-3 and do not
recognize either Kindlin-1 or Kindlin-2 (Fig 1C). Staining
was visualized using the Vectastain Elite universal ABCkit (Vector-Laboratories, Burlingame), followed by
counterstaining with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Three-amino9-ethyl-carbazole (Sigma-Aldrich, France) was used as the
chromogen.

Tumor and normal tissue samples were collected
from patients with breast cancer (tumor n=129; normal
n=23), lung cancer (tumor and normal matched pairs
n=18), kidney cancer (tumor n=15; normal n=11) or
melanoma (tumor n=71; normal skin n=17 and nevi
n=11). Written informed consent was obtained from
each patient according to the recommendations of the
local ethics committee. The study was approved by the
INSERM review board and ethic committee (IRB, number
X80). PMN cells from healthy donors were isolated by
Ficoll centrifugation and cryopreserved using standard
procedures. PMN and tumoral gDNA were extracted with
the DNA blood mini kit and DNA Tissue Kit (Qiagen)
respectively.

Western Blotting analyses

Cell lines

Western Blots were performed as described
previously [51] using anti-Kindlin-3 antibody
(Genosphere) or anti-phospho-Integrin β3 (pTyr785;
Sigma) normalized to actin or β3-integrin respectively.

Human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and
T47D, human melanoma cells SKMEL28 and human
lung cancer cells A549, were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC Manassas, VA). Human
melanoma cells M10 established from the primary nodular
melanoma of a patient, were cultured as previously
described [47]. Melan-a is a nontransformed mouse
melanocyte line that retains many of the characteristics of
normal melanocytes [48].

Human Phospho-Kinase Array
The human phospho-Kinase Array Kit (Proteome
Profiler Array, ARY003, R&D Systems, UK) was used
to detect relative levels of phosphorylation of 46 kinase
phosphorylation sites, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, using total cell lysates of cells transfected
with either Kindlin-3 or scrambled siRNA. Total cell
lysates were diluted to 150 to 200 µg/mL protein in a
detergent-, urea-, and phosphatase inhibitor-containing
solubilizing buffer (R&D Systems) and incubated with
the arrays overnight at 4°C. After washing away the
unbound material, membranes were incubated with a
cocktail of phosphosite–specific, biotinylated antibodies,
to detect phosphorylated kinases with streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase and signals were revealed with
a chemiluminescent substrate kit (ECL Dura Thermo
Scientific, 34076). Independent experiments were
performed in duplicate.

Expression Analyses

Real-Time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue
sections or cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, San
Diego). RNA quantity and quality was assessed using
the Nanodrop-ND-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies,
Wilmington). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a
High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied-Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Kindlin-1,
Kindlin-2 and Kindlin-3 primer and probe sets (sequences
are listed in supplementary Materials, available online)
were specifically designed for each transcript and span

Signalling pathways transcript analyses were
conducted using Human qPCR SignArrays® 96 system
(cell cycle, adhesion, migration and invasion gene
profiling analysis Human qPCR SignArrays® 96 kit; and
Perfect MasterMix SYBR Green® (AnyGenes, France) on
a LightCycler 480 (Roche, France) as described by the
manufacturer, in SKMEL28 and MDA-MB231 cells with
downregulated Kindlin-3 by siRNA, 24h after transfection.
Quality control of qPCR data for consequent analysis
was based on control for genomic DNA contamination
and positive and negative PCR controls. Briefly, a total
volume of 20µl of PCR mix, which included 10µl of
MasterMix, 8µl of double distilled water and 2µl of cDNA
was loaded into each of the 96 wells of the qPCR array.
PCR amplification was conducted at 95°C for 10 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 sec and 60°C for 30
sec. The mRNA expression for each gene was normalized
using the average expression of 8 housekeeping genes:
peptidylprolyl isomerase A (cyclophilin A, PPIA),
b-actin (ACTB), TATA box binding protein (TBP), beta2-microglobulin (B2M), ribosomal protein large PO
(RPLPO), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1
(HPRT1), transferring receptor (p90, CD71) (TFRC) and
glucuronidase beta (GUSB). Gene profiling analyses were
performed in three independent experiments. The ∆∆Ct
method was used for data analysis. Data analysis was
conducted using Excel spreadsheets in Windows. Fold
changes were calculated for each gene as the difference in
gene expression between cells transfected with Kindlin-3
siRNA and control siRNA using the CS2R software
provided by the manufacturer.

Copy number quantification
Kindlin-3 relative copy number was determined
by qPCR (cycle conditions available upon request) using
the LightCycler-480 System. Total DNA content was
estimated by assaying GAPDH for each sample, and 20
ng of gDNA was mixed with the SYBR-Green-I Master
(Roche) and 2 pmol/µl of each primer.

Oncomine database queries
(https://www.oncomine.org) were performed using
the same criteria for all tested cancer types. Briefly, we
searched all gene expression datasets for Kindlin-3 in the
“cancer versus normal analysis” category.

Bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing
Quantitative DNA methylation analysis was
performed by pyrosequencing of bisulfite treated DNA
[53]. One μg of DNA was bisulphite converted using
the EpiTect 96 Bisulfite kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Regions of interest were
amplified using 30 ng of bisulfite treated human genomic
DNA and 5 to 7.5 pmol of forward and reverse primer, one
of them being biotinylated. Sequences for oligonucleotides
for PCR amplification and pyrosequencing are given in
supplementary Materials (available online). Reaction
conditions were 1x HotStar Taq buffer supplemented
with 1.6 mM MgCl2, 100 µM dNTPs and 2.0 U HotStar
Taq polymerase (Qiagen) in a 25 µl volume. The PCR
program consisted of a denaturing step of 15 min at
95°C followed by 50 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at the
respective annealing temperature and 20 s at 72°C, with a
final extension of 5 min at 72°C. Ten µl of PCR product
were rendered single-stranded as previously described [53]
and 4 pmol of the respective sequencing primer were used
for analysis. Quantitative DNA methylation analysis was
carried out on a PSQ 96MD system with the PyroGold
SQA Reagent Kit (Qiagen) and results were analyzed
using the Q-CpG software (V.1.0.9, Biotage AB).

Genetic Analyses.

Genome-wide DNA array analysis
Genomic DNAs from melanoma tissues (n=15)
were analyzed by high-density array comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH) technologies using the 1
× 1M Microarray SurePrint G3 (Agilent Technologies)
according to the manufacturers’ recommendations.
Analyses were performed using the Genomic Workbench
software (Agilent Technologies) with the help of the
ADM-2 algorithm for array CGH data, Genomic Suite
6.5 software (Partek). The final retained abnormalities
were validated by two investigators by visual inspection
considering the size and Log2 ratios of the abnormalities
with respect to the individual background noise of each
array at each particular chromosomal location, as reported
previously [52]. Polymorphic copy number variations
were excluded using the Database of the Genomic Variants

5-Aza-2′ deoxycytidine treatment
Tumor cell lines were treated with demethylating
agent 5-Aza-2′deoxycytidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 days
at a concentration of 5μM. Total RNA extracted from
treated and untreated cell lines were reverse transcribed
analyzed by real time quantitative PCR for Kindlin-3 and

Expression vectors and Small interfering RNA
transfections
The complete open reading frame of the human
Kindlin-3 gene was amplified by PCR, cloned into the
pcDNA 3.1-GFP TOPO-TA mammalian expression
vector (Invitrogen), and transiently transfected into
MDA-MB-231, SKMEL28 tumor cells and Melan-a
melanocytes. Control vector (pcDNA3.1-GFP) containing
no insert was used to generate negative control cells.
Vectors were sequenced in the forward and reverse
directions to verify the insertion of the Kindlin-3 and GFP
sequences and the lack of insert in the control plasmids.
For Kindlin-3 knockdown, two different Kindlin-3
siRNA (IDs:s38130 and Ids:s38131; Applied-Biosystems)
and scrambled siRNA oligos (Control) were used with
Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) as transfectant.

In situ PLA used to assess protein-protein
interactions, cells grown on Lab-tek chamber slides
(Nunc, #154534), transfected with Kindlin-3 or control
siRNA and immediately ﬁxed were subjected to In situ
PLA using the Duolink Detection kit (Olink Bioscience,
Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Brieﬂy, slides were blocked, incubated with antibodies
directed against Kindlin-3 (Genosphere), Integrins β1, β3
or β5 (Abcam ab58524, Santa Cruz sc-14009, sc-14010)
or Talin (Abcam ab11188) and thereafter incubated with
PLA probes, which are secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit
and anti-mouse) conjugated to unique oligonucleotides.
Circularization and ligation of the oligonucleotides was
followed by an ampliﬁcation step. The products were
detected by a complementary ﬂuorescently labeled probe.
Protein complexes were visualized in a laser-scanning
confocal microscope (Leica-Lasertechnik) as bright
fluorescent signals.

Cellular assays

PAC-1 Immunofluorescence
Active conformation of αIIbβ3 integrin in
melanoma cells was essentially performed as already
described [31]. Briefly, tumor cells plated on coverslips
and allowed to adhere for 45 min were incubated for 1
hr with the mouse anti-human mAb PAC-1:FITC IgM
(20µg/ml) that specifically recognizes the high-affinity
αIIbβ3 integrin [30] or a mouse IgM:FITC used as control
antibody (Becton Dickinson, France). Adherent cells
were then fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde prior to
visualization by confocal microscope.

Functional in vitro assays
Adhesion assays were performed on cells incubated
with immobilized integrin ligands (fibronectin, collagen I
and collagen III), in triplicate, for 30 min at 37 °C. After
washing, cells were fixed and treated with 0.5% crystal
violet staining. An automated plate reader was used to
quantitate cell attachment, once each well was solubilized
with Sorenson solution, and OD read at 590nm.
The in vitro migration (on uncoated filters) and
invasion (on coated filters with matrigel) were performed
using a modified Boyden chamber [54] in 24-well plates
and 8-mm pore filter inserts (BD Bioscience).
Proliferation assay on transfected cells seeded on 96well plates was measured using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous
Non Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega).
For anchorage-independent assays, transfected cells
were mixed with 1 ml of growth media and 0.3% agar and
then layered onto 0.5% agar beds in 60-mm diameter Petri
dishes. Cells were allowed to grow for 10 days and the
entire area of the dish was counted. Colonies were counted
and the plates were photographed. Assays were conducted
in triplicate.

Live imaging of cells
Live fluorescent microscopy of adhesion/migration
dynamics was performed 30min after plating SKMEL28
cells expressing RFP-actin on IBIDI plates (IBIDI
HI-q4). Imaging was performed using 20x and 40x
objectives on a Nikon BioStation IM Live Cell Recorder
(Nikon Instruments Inc.) and image acquisition was
done every 3 min. For actin labelling, SKMEL28 cells
were transduced with RFP-actin using BacMam reagent
(Invitrogen, CellLight® Reagent BacMam 2.0). The
reagent was directly added to the cells at approximately
60% confluence followed by incubation for 16 hr at 37°C,
after which the cells were trypsinized, plated and imaged
as above.

were stably transfected with psiRNA-h7SK vector with
small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Kindlin-3 or with
shRNA control (Invivogen, France). Female 6-week-old
nude/c mice were injected subcutaneously with 5×106
SKMEL28 and 3×106 MDA-MB-231 stably transfected
Kindlin-3 shRNA or control shRNA cells (n=10 controlGFP and n=10 Kindlin-3-shRNA-GFP cells, for each cell
line). Tumor size was measured twice a week by caliper.
Five weeks later, all mice were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation, and primary tumors were removed and
measured with calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated
as: volume (cm3)=a×b2/2 (a and b are the two registered
perpendicular diameters, with a > b). For metastasis
analyses, lungs for SKMEL28 and lungs, livers and
lymph nodes for MDA-MB-231, were also dissected
and metastatic foci were searched at different levels on
serial sections (every 300 μm) in each organ and analyzed
using Axiovert fluorescent microscopy. The number of
metastatic foci was determined in a blinded manner by
two independent pathologists.
