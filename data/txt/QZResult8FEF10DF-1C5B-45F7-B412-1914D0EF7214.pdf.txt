BACKGROUND: The recently developed the Src and Abelson (Abl) kinase inhibitor dasatinib has antitumor effects in
epithelial and mesenchymal tumors. Preclinical data have indicated that dasatinib is metabolized primarily through
cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and may cause QT prolongation. In light of its improved tolerability, the authors
were interested in the safety of a once-daily dasatinib regimen. METHODS: The authors conducted a phase 1 trial of
dasatinib in 29 patients with advanced solid tumors. Segment 1 of the trial was short term and sequential and was
designed to determine whether the coadministration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole had an effect on
the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib. Segment 2 was designed to evaluate the safety of dasatinib as dosing was
increased. QT intervals were monitored closely in both segments. Efficacy was assessed in Segment 2 using both
positron emission tomography and computed tomography. RESULTS: Hematologic toxicities were markedly less than
those observed in patients with leukemia, whereas nonhematologic toxicities were similar. The authors determined
that the maximum recommended dose was 180 mg once daily based on the incidence of pleural effusion. Coadministration of ketoconazole led to a marked increase in dasatinib exposure, which was correlated with an increase in corrected QT (QTc) values of approximately 6 msec. No adverse cardiac events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The
dose-limiting toxic effect for dasatinib was pleural effusion. The pharmacokinetic and cardiac studies indicated that
coadministration of dasatinib with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or agents that prolong the QTc interval should be
avoided if possible. Close monitoring for toxicity and dose reduction should be considered if the coadministration of

The dysregulation of signal transduction is central to the progression of cancer. In the past decade, inhibitors of tyrosine
kinases that control signal transduction pathways have been a subject of great interest because of their ability to affect biologically important targets, the development of potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors with favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics, and the discovery that such agents are well tolerated and clinically effective.
Src family kinases (SFKs) are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases involved in signal transduction in both normal cells and cancer
cells. Increased SFK protein levels and activity have been observed in multiple epithelial cancers, sarcomas, and hematologic
malignancies.1 In colon cancer, the expression and activation of c-Src correlate with malignant progression.2 It has been observed
that inhibiting SFK activity using both molecular approaches and pharmacologic inhibitors induces cell cycle arrest3 and apoptosis4 and decreases anchorage-independent growth, tumor cell proliferation,4 tumor growth in vivo,4,5 in vitro invasion and migration,6 in vivo metastasis,5 and vascularity in vivo4 in multiple cancer cell types. In addition to having direct effects on cancer cells,
SFK inhibitors also may affect cancer progression by inhibiting bone lysis, angiogenesis, and endothelial cell permeability.7

Dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company,
Princeton, NJ) is a thiazole-based, dual-SFK/Abelson (Abl)
kinase inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of leukemia. Dasatinib is a potent SFK inhibitor in cell lines, both
in culture and in animals, that has antitumor effects in preclinical models at levels that are achievable in humans,
including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer, mesothelioma, prostate cancer, colon
cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, sarcoma, small cell
lung cancer, and melanoma.5,6,8-11 Given the promising
preclinical data, further study of dasatinib in solid tumors is
warranted. Dose escalation above those doses recommended
in patients with leukemia (100 mg daily) may be necessary
to inhibit intratumoral SFKs or other kinase targets.
In the current study, we sought to evaluate the toxicity of dasatinib in patients with solid tumors; because,
although the toxicity profile of dasatinib is known in
patients with leukemia, it has not been established in
patients with solid tumors. In addition to conducting
standard safety assessments, we closely monitored
patients’ QT intervals; because, in vitro, human ether-ago-go–related gene and Purkinje-fiber assays have suggested that dasatinib prolongs cardiac repolarization. An
additional objective of this study was to evaluate the effect
of the coadministration of potent cytochrome P450 3A4
(CYP3A4) inhibitors with dasatinib. We hypothesized
that the coadministration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor
ketoconazole would increase dasatinib exposure and toxicity, because dasatinib is metabolized primarily by the
CYP3A4 enzyme.12 Because many commonly used medications are CYP3A4 inhibitors, it is important to define
this potential drug interaction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Design and Eligibility Criteria
This was a multi-institution, open-label, phase 1 trial that
was conducted in 2 segments. Segment 1 was a single-

Cancer

sequence study that was designed to determine the effects
of the coadministration of ketoconazole on the steadystate pharmacokinetics of dasatinib. Segment 2 was an
ascending-dose study that was designed to evaluate the
safety of dasatinib in patients with advanced solid tumors.
The trial was open to adults who had advanced solid
tumors that were refractory to standard therapy, measurable or evaluable disease, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score from 0 to 2.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Additional inclusion criteria included a neutrophil count
>2000 cells/lL, a platelet count >100,000 cells/lL, a hemoglobin level >9 g/dL, bilirubin and creatinine levels
<1.5 times the upper limits of normal for the institution,
alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels <2 times the
upper limits of normal, serum potassium and magnesium
levels within the normal ranges, a QT interval <450
msec, and a calcium level greater than the lower limit of
normal for the institution. Patients who had untreated
brain metastasis, serious concurrent medical illness, or significant cardiac disease were excluded.
Drug Administration
Dosing schedules for Segments 1 and 2 are provided in
Table 1. During Segment 2, patients were accrued in successive cohorts with 3 dose levels (90 mg every 12 hours
twice daily, 140 mg once daily, and 180 mg once daily).
Initially, we started with a twice-daily dosing regimen, but
we changed to a daily dosing regimen because of emerging
evidence that intermittent target inhibition preserves efficacy and improves tolerability.13
If no patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT), then the next cohort received the next higher dose
level. The dose just below that at which 33% of patients
experienced a DLT was designed to be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Toxicities were defined using the US
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. We defined a DLT as

1583

Original Article

any event that occurred in the first 4 weeks of treatment,
was attributable to dasatinib, and met the following criteria: grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, excluding alopecia, fatigue, or nausea; grade 3 or 4 nausea that was not
controllable with medical intervention; electrocardiography (ECG) that revealed a rate-corrected QT (QTc) value
>530 msec; grade 4 neutropenia that lasted >5 days; neutropenic fever; grade 4 thrombocytopenia; or any toxicity
that required withholding dasatinib for 14 days.
No intrapatient dose escalation was permitted, and
dose reductions were permanent. Patients who were considered evaluable for MTD determination were those who
had received treatment for at least 4 weeks or who had discontinued treatment because of study-related toxic effects.
Patients continued to receive dasatinib until their disease
progressed, unacceptable toxicity occurred, or consent
was withdrawn.
Pharmacokinetic Evaluation
Plasma was isolated from patients’ whole blood for pharmacokinetic measurements on Days 2 through 5 and
Days 8 through 10 of Segment 1 and on Days 1 and 26 of
Segment 2, Cycle 1 (see Table 1). On Days 2 and 8 of Segment 1, the blood was drawn before and at 0.5 hours, 1
hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours,
10 hours, and 24 hours after dasatinib administration; the
24-hour sample was drawn before the next day’s dose was
administered. Predose (trough) levels were measured on
Days 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10. On Day 8, ketoconazole levels in
the blood were measured before and at 2 hours, 4 hours, 6
hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, and 12 hours after ketoconazole
administration. In Segment 2, blood was drawn before
and at 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours after dasatinib administration on Days 1 and 26.
Blood was collected in tubes that contained potassium
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (dasatinib specimens) or
sodium heparin (ketoconazole specimens) and was separated in a centrifuge at 2000g for 10 minutes at 4 C.
Plasma was analyzed for levels of ketoconazole, dasatinib,
and 2 active metabolites of dasatinib (M4 and M5) using a
validated, liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method (unpublished method; Bristol-Myers Squibb
Company). Briefly, spiked analytical quality control (QC)
samples were analyzed with the study samples to assess the
accuracy and precision of each analytical run. The standard
curves were well fitted by a 1/2-weighted linear equation
over the concentration range from 1 ng/mL to 1000 ng/
mL. Values for the between-run and within-run precision
of analytical QC samples for dasatinib and metabolites were

1584

within the prespecified range of a 10% coefficient of variation with deviations from the nominal concentrations of no
more than 9%. The standard curve and QC data indicated that the method of using dasatinib and metabolites in
a human plasma assay was precise and accurate. The lower
limit of detection was 1 ng/mL.
A noncompartmental method was used to derive
pharmacokinetic parameters for dasatinib, M4, and M5
from plasma concentration-time data using Kinetica 4.4.1
in the eToolbox (version 2.6.1; Thermo Electron Corp.,
Philadelphia, Pa). The parameters were the maximum
observed plasma concentration (Cmax), the time of Cmax
(Tmax), the area under the plasma concentration-time
curve in a dosing interval (AUC), and the plasma half-life.
To assess the effect of ketoconazole on the steady-state
pharmacokinetics of dasatinib, analyses of variance were
performed on log(Cmax) and log(AUC) values for dasatinib. The factors in each analysis were study day (Days 2
and 8) as a fixed effect and patient as a random effect.
Point estimates and 2-sided 90% confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated for the Day 8-to-Day 2 ratios of geometric means of the Cmax and AUC of dasatinib.
Cardiac Monitoring
Before Segment 1, a 12-lead ECG was performed in triplicate over 24 hours to construct a time-matched baseline.
During treatment, ECG was conducted in triplicate at all
time points when samples for pharmacokinetic testing
were obtained on Days 2 through 5 and Days 8 through
10. ECG results were reviewed by the investigator on site
and by the ECG core laboratory (eResearch Technology,
Philadelphia, Pa) using an MUSE system with intervals
measured on a GE Marquette 12 SL computer algorithm
(GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wis). All ECG intervals were adjudicated by a board-certified cardiologist
who was blinded to patients’ dosing regimens and day of
study. Individual ECG parameters were based on the average values at each time point, and changes were measured
from the time-matched baseline values. In Segment 2,
ECGs were similarly conducted on Days 1 and 26.
Assessment of Clinical Efficacy
18
F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans were
obtained at baseline and at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks
after the start of therapy on Segment 2; and CT scans
were obtained every 8 weeks thereafter. Tumor response
was assessed according to World Health Organization criteria. Measurable lesions were defined as those that could

be measured accurately in at least 1 dimension, with at
least 1 greatest dimension 2.0 cm (or at least 1.0 cm
for spiral CT). Metabolic response was measured using
FDG-PET scans and was assessed using guidelines established by the European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer.14 Briefly, a partial metabolic
response was defined as a reduction >25% in the tumor
FDG standardized uptake value (SUV); and progressive
metabolic disease was defined as an increase >25% in the
tumor FDG SUV, an increase in the extent of FDG
uptake, or the appearance of new FDG uptake.

are illustrated in patients who received 20 mg of
once daily alone (solid circles) or in combination

In addition, 11 new patients were enrolled directly in Segment 2. Table 2 summarizes patient characteristics for the
28 patients who were enrolled on Segment 2. The median
time from cancer diagnosis to enrollment in the study was
40 months (range, 4-122 months). All patients had
received previous chemotherapy, and the median number
of prior chemotherapy regimens was 4 (range, 1-9).
Pharmacokinetics
To determine whether the steady-state pharmacokinetics
of dasatinib were affected by the coadministration of ketoconazole, we compared the pharmacokinetic parameters
of dasatinib on Day 2 (no ketoconazole) and Day 8 (coadministration of ketoconazole) of Segment 1. The mean
plasma concentration-time profiles for dasatinib on Days
2 and 8 demonstrated that coadministration of ketoconazole markedly increased plasma dasatinib levels (Fig. 1).
Both the Cmax and the AUC were higher when ketoconazole was present (Fig. 2). On Days 2 and 8, the values for
Cmax were 14 ng/mL and 51 ng/mL, respectively, and
the values for AUC were 71 ng*hour/mL and 345
ng*hour/mL, respectively. The Day 8-to-Day 2 ratios for
Cmax and AUC were 3.56 (90% CI, 2.86-4.44) and 4.84
(90% CI, 3.83-6.13), respectively. In addition, the mean
terminal-phase half life (T-half) (standard deviation
[SD]) increased from 3.3 hours (1.0 hour) to 8.7 hours
(3.9 hours). Levels of the dasatinib metabolites M4 and

patients (27%) on the 180-mg daily regimen and 1 of 6
patients (17%) on the 90-mg twice daily regimen received
85% relative dose intensity. Two patients at the 180-mg
daily dose level and 1 patient at the 140-mg daily dose
level had permanent dose reductions because of toxicity.

Figure 2. Individual dasatinib (Top) maximum observed
plasma concentration (Cmax) and (Bottom) area under the
plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values are shown for
dasatinib alone and in combination with ketoconazole,
respectively. The drop in Cmax and AUC values in 1 patient
after the ketoconazole treatment appeared to be an outlier.
Decreased Cmax and AUC values in 1 patient may have been
the result of incomplete absorption on the day of treatment
with dasatinib plus ketoconazole.

M5 on Day 8 were higher than those on Day 2. However,
both M4 and M5 are minor metabolites, and the metabolic proportions ranged from 1.8% to 5.7%.
Dose Administration and Intensity
In Segment 2, the first 6 patients started at a dasatinib
dose of 90 mg twice daily, the next 11 patients started at
140 mg daily, and the final 11 patients started at 180 mg
daily. Ten patients (36%) required at least 1 dose interruption, and most of those patients were receiving a total
daily dose of 180 mg. The average daily dose ranged from
122 mg to 140 mg for patients in the 140-mg cohort and
from 114 mg to 180 mg for patients in the 180-mg
cohorts, and the median dose intensity was 140 mg and

1586

Toxicity
Of the 28 patients who received treatment during Segment 2, 20 patients (71%) ceased participation in the trial
because of cancer progression. Four patients experienced
clinical deterioration without a DLT and withdrew from
the trial. Another patient died during the trial, 1 patient
discontinued participation because of a DLT (dysphagia
leading to dehydration and hospitalization), and 2
patients discontinued therapy after receiving only 1 dose
of dasatinib (1 because of an adverse event not related to
dasatinib and the other because of a prolonged QTc
interval).
The most frequent drug-related adverse events were
pleural effusion, fatigue, and vomiting (Table 3). Except
for 1 patient with grade 3 anemia, significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory values (hematology, coagulation, and serum chemistry parameters) were not observed.
The most frequent serious adverse events (SAEs), excluding cancer progression, were dyspnea, pleural effusion,
pyrexia, and dehydration (Table 3). We considered pleural effusion, dyspnea, and dysphagia as SAEs related to
dasatinib.
Eight patients died of disease progression within 30
days of their last dose of dasatinib. The patient who died
during the trial was a man aged 80 years who had colorectal cancer and liver metastases. He presented on Day 4
of Segment 2 with increasing dyspnea and bilateral pleural
effusions. He was admitted to the hospital, underwent
thoracentesis, and dasatinib was discontinued. Nine days
later, he had left-sided facial weakness consistent with a
stroke, but no further workup was done because of his
advanced cancer. He died 1 day later.
Cardiac Effects of Dasatinib
The primary objective of cardiac monitoring was to measure the effect of dasatinib on the QT interval. Because of
the strong correlation between QT interval and heart rate,
we considered several formulas for QT correction.15 We
used baseline ECGs to determine which formula yielded
data that were least affected by heart rate. The Pearson
correlation coefficients between QT interval, QTc value,
and heart rate were 0.869 (QT, uncorrected), 0.282

(Bazett formula), 0.388 (Fridericia formula), 0.213
(linear population), and 0.201 (log-linear population).
Therefore, we used the log-linear population correction
(QTcLogP) in our analysis, because it was affected the
least by heart rate.
All 18 patients who received treatment in Segment 1
were evaluable for cardiac effects. To determine whether
plasma dasatinib concentrations affected QT interval, we
plotted time-matched QTcLogP changes from baseline
against dasatinib concentrations for each study day (Fig.
3). Then, we fitted on the plots linear mixed regressions,
which were performed on the change in QTcLogP at
dasatinib Tmax and at dasatinib Cmax for each study day.
We observed no clear relations between QTcLogP or
change in QTcLogP and plasma dasatinib concentrations.
Because the Day 8 dasatinib exposures (AUCs) were
4.8 times as high as those on Day 2, we compared Day 2

and Day 8 QTc values. The mean (SD) QTcLogP after
drug administration on Day 2 did not differ significantly
from baseline. Geometric mean changes from baseline in
QTcLogP across all time points on Days 2 and 8 were 3.3
msec (2-sided 90% CI, from 0.9 msec to 7.6 msec) and
9.4 msec (2-sided 90% CI, 4.3-14.4 msec), respectively.
More patients had an increase in QTcLogP >30 msec on
Day 8 (6 patients) than on Day 2 (3 patients).
No SAEs were related to ECG changes. Also, no
patient had a QTcLogP >480 msec: The greatest increase
in QTcLogP was 58 msec. One patient did experience an
increase in his QTc interval that necessitated withdrawal
from the trial. Although he completed Segment 1 without
incident, his QTc interval on Day 1 of Segment 2 (ie, after
a 5-day washout from dasatinib) was read on site as 491
msec, so dasatinib treatment was not started. That day,

from the trial. Three of the 11 patients who received 180
mg of dasatinib once daily had grade 3 pleural effusions,
and 1 of those 3 patients died (as described above).
Although a dose level at which one-third of patients experienced a DLT was not reached (ie, the predefined
MTD), the finding that 3 of 11 patients who received 180
mg of dasatinib once daily had 85% relative dose intensity suggested that a higher dose probably would not be
tolerated. Therefore, we established 180 mg once daily as
the maximum recommended dose.

and hypokalemia and was given intravenous fluids containing potassium. The next day, his electrolyte levels
were normal, and his QTc was 450 msec, which was not
significantly different from baseline. Therefore, he
received 1 dose of dasatinib as part of Segment 2 and was
placed under more intensive cardiac monitoring. On Day
2 of Segment 2, the patient’s QTc was read on site as 497
msec, and he was removed from the trial. Later, his
QTcLogP was calculated as 480 msec. The patient had no
adverse cardiac event while on the study or during the 30
days afterward.
During Segment 2, 22 patients (79%) had maximum QTc values according to the Fridericia formula
(QTc[F]) <450 msec, and 6 patients (21%) had maximum values from 450 msec to 500 msec. The change in
QTc(F) from baseline was <30 msec in 15 patients
(54%), between 30 msec and 60 msec in 10 patients
(36%), and >60 msec in 3 patients (11%; 1 patient in
each dose group).
Determination of Recommended Dose
Of the 6 patients who received 90 mg of dasatinib twice
daily during Segment 2, 1 patient experienced a DLT
(grade 3 dyspnea caused by pneumonia and pleural effusions). His dose was reduced; and, eventually, he withdrew from the trial because of disease progression. Two of
the 11 patients who received 140 mg of dasatinib once
daily had treatment-related DLTs; 1 patient had grade 3
abdominal cramping and diarrhea and continued on the

Efficacy
Twenty-four patients (86%) were evaluable for response.
No complete or partial responses were observed. Six
patients (21%) had stable disease as their best response,
including 1 patient (sarcoma) in the cohort that received
140 mg daily and 5 patients (colon cancer, melanoma, osteosarcoma, myxoid sarcoma, and ovarian carcinoma) in
the cohorts that received 180 mg daily. The patient who
had high-grade myxoid sarcoma with a leiomyosarcoma
component had prolonged stable disease and received 40
weeks of therapy. All 6 patients who had stable disease
had progression before initiating dasatinib: Five patients
had confirmed radiographic progression, and 1 patient
had clinical progression. The remaining 18 patients had
progressive disease. Of the 24 evaluable patients, 15
patients had PET imaging studies that allowed for evaluation of metabolic response: Ten patients of those had a
partial metabolic response, 3 patients had stable disease,
and 2 patients had progressive metabolic disease.

DISCUSSION
In our phase 1 trial of dasatinib in patients with solid
tumors who had received multiple lines of previous therapy, the toxicity profile of dasatinib was consistent with
its profile in patients with leukemia, except that we
observed significantly less hematologic toxicity.13,16-18
We identified pleural effusion as a DLT and defined the
maximum recommended dose as 180 mg daily. Our data
were consistent with findings in patients with leukemia
indicating that higher total doses of dasatinib lead to more
toxic effects. Concurrent administration of dasatinib with
the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole led to marked
increases in dasatinib levels. Several patients had stable
disease as their best response, but no objective responses
were observed.

Dasatinib in Solid Tumors/Johnson et al

In patients with leukemia, myelosuppression is the
most common toxic effect of dasatinib. The most common serious nonhematologic toxicities (ie, grades 3 and
4) are hemorrhage, fluid retention (including pleural effusion), dyspnea, respiratory infection, and diarrhea.13,17,18
In another phase 1 study of dasatinib in patients with solid
tumors, significant toxic effects included pleural effusion,
anorexia, nausea, rash, and fatigue.19
We did not observe any significant hematologic
toxic effects except for anemia in 1 patient, which indicated that patients with leukemia are more prone to these
effects. The toxicities in our study that most affected
patients’ ability to continue therapy were fatigue and pleural effusion. However, because patients with advanced
solid tumors have high rates of fatigue at baseline, determining the contribution of dasatinib to fatigue is difficult.
All 4 patients who experienced clinical deterioration and
withdrew from the study without having a DLT experienced fatigue and had advanced disease that progressed
soon after they withdrew. Although from 13% to 20% of
patients with leukemia also commonly experience fatigue
during dasatinib treatment, grade 3 or 4 fatigue is rare
(<3%).13
Pleural effusion is a common dasatinib-related toxicity in patients with leukemia (it occurs in 2%36%)13,16-18 and is associated with risk factors that
include a cardiac history, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
autoimmune disease, a higher total dose of dasatinib, and
development of rash during therapy.13,16,20 In our current
study, more patients in the cohorts that received 180 mg
of dasatinib daily (47%) had effusions than patients in the
cohort that received 140 mg daily (9%). All of the effusions developed within 1 month of starting therapy; and,
in 1 patient, the effusions developed 4 days after initiating
dasatinib. We also identified pre-existing pleural disease
as a potential risk factor for dasatinib-induced pleural
effusions, although our study sample was too small to conduct meaningful statistical analyses of this variable. Of the
3 patients with grade 3 pleural effusions, 1 had pleural
metastasis; 1 had a baseline right pleural effusion, and 1
had parenchymal lung metastasis but no detectable pleural
disease. Only 17% of our patients without baseline effusions developed effusions after receiving dasatinib. The
etiology of dasatinib-induced effusions is not known;
however, findings that pleural effusions are associated
with autoimmune diseases20; that the effusions respond to
pulse steroids13; and that they usually are exudative, sterile, and contain lymphocytes or neutrophils21 have led to
the hypothesis that such effusions are immune-mediated.

Although pleural effusion was the main DLT in our study,
patients who were treated at the currently approved 100
mg daily dose experienced pleural effusion only rarely
(<2%).13
Dasatinib is rapidly absorbed (Tmax, 0.5-6 hours)
and metabolized (with an elimination half-life of 3-5
hours) in humans. In vitro assays suggest that dasatinib is
metabolized primarily by the P450 isoform CYP3A4.12
Ketoconazole, a well tolerated antifungal agent and a specific, potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, is considered a model
drug for testing interactions that involve CYP3A4 substrates.22 Oral doses of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily
for 5 days achieve steady-state conditions and the maximum inhibition of CYP3A4. The plasma levels of ketoconazole on Day 8 in our study (data not shown) were
similar to levels reported in the literature. A previous clinical study demonstrated comparable exposure to dasatinib
between Day 1 and Day 26 when it was given alone at 15
mg daily, 30 mg daily, and 50 mg daily.23 Because dasatinib has a short half-life, it is likely that the exposure to
dasatinib would be similar between Days 2 and 8, and
steady-state conditions should have been achieved by Day
8 in our trial. Furthermore, in our trial, plasma concentrations of dasatinib observed before and 24 hours after
administration on Day 8 were comparable (data not
shown), suggesting that a steady state had been achieved
by Day 8 (after dasatinib and ketoconazole had been coadministered for 6 days).
In our trial, the mean Cmax and AUC of dasatinib
on Day 8 were increased by approximately 4 times and 5
times, respectively, compared with their mean levels on
Day 2. This is consistent with the finding that CYP3A4 is
responsible for most of the metabolic elimination of dasatinib. In addition, the arithmetic mean T-half of dasatinib
substantially increased from Day 2 to Day 8, implying
that the decrease in the systemic clearance of dasatinib
resulted from the inhibition of CYP3A4 in the liver. Our
findings indicate that, if dasatinib must be administered
concurrently with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, then the
dasatinib dose should be reduced. Because the recommended starting dose of dasatinib is 100 mg daily,24 a
dose decrease to 20 mg daily should be considered, and
the patient should be monitored closely for toxicity. If the
combined therapy is not tolerated, then either the
CYP3A4 inhibitor or the dasatinib must be discontinued.
We studied the effect of dasatinib on QT interval;
because, although dasatinib does not directly impair cardiac mitochondrial function, data have demonstrated an
effect of dasatinib Purkinje-fiber assays in vitro.25 In our

1589

Original Article

study, when dasatinib and ketoconazole were coadministered, the mean increase in plasma concentration of dasatinib (4.8 times) was associated with an increase in the
QTc interval of about 6 msec.
Our QTc interval findings were consistent with
those from studies of dasatinib in patients with leukemia.
For example, in an integrated analysis of their clinical program (467 patients with leukemia), investigators observed
that long-term treatment with dasatinib (70 mg twice
daily) was associated with a 3-msec to 6-msec average
increase in the QTc interval compared with baseline. All
of the upper 95% 1-sided CIs for the mean changes in
QTc at each time point were <8 msec. Long-term dasatinib treatment was associated infrequently with absolute
QTc values >500 msec (0.7%) or changes >60 msec
(2.9%). The increase in QTc reported after the start of
dasatinib treatment was present by Days 5 through 8 and
was similar in magnitude at 1 month. No effect was
reported after a single dose, no progression was evident
beyond 1 week, and no relation to total cumulative exposure was detected.
Studies in patients with leukemia had a limitation
that our trial also had: No placebo groups were included
for comparison because of ethical constraints. Because of
the lack of a placebo group and another limitation—the
study’s sequential design—it is possible that the increase
in QTc we observed during chronic treatment was not
fully present by Day 2. In addition, ketoconazole may
have an independent effect on QTc.26 The inherent variability in QTc intervals over time, combined with our
sample size (n ¼ 18 patients in Segment 1), also limited
our ability to quantify small changes in the QTc interval
that resulted from dasatinib. Despite these limitations,
we can say it is likely that dasatinib does cause a small
increase in the QTc interval in humans, because such
increases have been observed consistently in several studies. However, this small increase in QTc is unlikely to
cause any significant harm, because cardiac toxicity
(other than pericardial effusion) has not been reported
for dasatinib in multiple clinical trials.13,17,18 One
patient in our study had QTc prolongation, but it
occurred 5 days after he stopped receiving dasatinib and
was associated with hypokalemia, which influences cardiac depolarization. Plasma dasatinib concentrations for
that patient were similar to those of other patients in the
trial. Nevertheless, dasatinib should be administered with
caution to patients who have or may develop QTc prolongation and patients who are taking medications that
lead to QT prolongation.

The main DLT of dasatinib was pleural effusion,
but no significant hematologic toxicity was observed.
Monitoring with a chest x-ray is warranted in the first
month of therapy to evaluate for pleural effusions. Pharmacokinetic and cardiac studies suggest that coadministration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or agents that
prolong the QTc interval should be avoided if possible.
Because solid tumor cell lines are less sensitive than Bcr/
Abl-positive cells to dasatinib in preclinical models, dose
escalation above those doses recommended in patients
with leukemia may be necessary to demonstrate an antitumor effect. In addition, toxicities are distinct in these
patient populations. Thus, we explored doses above the
leukemia dose of 100 mg daily. On the basis of our data,
additional experience with dasatinib in solid tumors, and
the leukemia data, the initial dose of dasatinib monotherapy should be between 140 mg and 180 mg daily. Given
our findings and the promising preclinical data, further
study of dasatinib in solid tumors is warranted.
