ABSTRACT
Multicellular spheroids are very attractive models in oncology because they
mimic the 3D organization of the tumour cells with their microenvironment. We show
here using 3 different cell types (mammary TSA/pc, embryonic kidney Hek293 and
cervical cancer HeLa), that when the cells are growing as spheroids the frequency of
binucleated cells is augmented as occurs in some human tumours.
We therefore describe mitosis in multicellular spheroids by following mitotic
markers and by time-lapse experiments. Chromosomes alignment appears to be correct
on the metaphasic plate and the passenger complex is well localized on centromere.
Moreover aurora kinases are fully active and histone H3 is phosphorylated on Ser 10.
Consequently, the mitotic spindle checkpoint is satisfied and, anaphase proceeds as
illustrated by the transfer of survivin on the spindle and by the segregation of the
two lots of chromosomes. However, the segregation plane is not well defined and
oscillations of the dividing cells are observed. Finally, cytokinesis fails and the absence
of separation of the two daughter cells gives rise to binucleated cells.
Division orientation is specified during interphase and persists throughout
mitosis. Our data indicate that the cancer cells, in multicellular spheroids, lose their
ability to regulate their orientation, a feature commonly encountered in tumours.
Moreover, multicellular spheroid expansion is still sensitive to mitotic drugs
as pactlitaxel and aurora kinase inhibitors. The spheroids thus represent a highly
relevant model for studying drug efficiency in tumours.

of nutrient and oxygen [1]. 3D-multicellular spheroids
include proliferating, quiescent and hypoxic regions and,
display very different sensibilities towards anti-cancer
drugs and a more realistic anti-cancer drug response
model compared to 2D cultures [2]. 3D systems also
offer the opportunity to co-culture different types of cells,
such as tumour cells plus as well as stromal fibroblast
and immune cells. Complex spheroids also mimic the
microenvironment of the tumour and, compared to monocellular spheroids, different biochemical pathways are
activated. As an example, the presence of cancer-activated
fibroblasts within melanoma spheroids was shown to
prevent ERK/MAP signalling and to re-activate FAK
proliferating pathway [3].
Several systems of 3D-cell culture have been
developed [4]. In the simplest one, the free floating
spheroid, tumour cells are allowed to aggregate on a

INTRODUCTION
For several decades, two-dimensional- (2D)cell cultures were used for the screening of anti-cancer
drugs, however they do not fully recapitulate the solid
tumour architecture and its biology. Cells grown as
monolayer, on 2D surfaces, present few cell-cell and
cell–matrix interactions with a stretched and abnormal
cytoskeleton rearrangement that lead to aberrant gene and
protein expression. Additionally, the cells are uniformly
oxygenated with a full access to nutriments. These changes
result in accelerated doubling times. Three-dimensional
(3D)-cultures emerged that realistically recapitulated
tumour cell behaviour and have become, therefore,
increasingly popular, in recent years. The architecture of
3D-cultures reflects the microenvironment of solid tumour
with appropriated cell-cell interactions as well as gradients

non-adherent support [5]. This system was then modified
in order to introduce an extracellular matrix (ECM),
which is a key regulator of normal homeostasis and
tissue phenotype. Laminin-rich extracellular matrix and
basement-membrane extracts (matrigelTM) were used to
grow the cells within or on-top of these matrix [6, 7].
Alternatively, tumour cells have been encapsulated in
alginate hydrogels [8]. Alginate is a natural polymer that
provides an inert 3D-environment. It can be mixed with
ECM and allow to study the aggressiveness of tumours as
a function of the matrix stiffness [9]. Organoid models are
also developed from cancer tissues: stem cells are isolated
and embedded in ECM. Such reconstituted organoids have
similar heterogeneities to the original tumours [10].
These 3D systems are valuable tools for anticancer drug testing [11]. Comparison of gene and protein
expression reveals that metabolic, cell stress-response,
structural, signal transduction, and cellular transport
proteins are expressed at different levels in spheroids as
compared to 2D-cultured cells [12] and [13].
In growing spheroids, the proliferating cells are
preferentially located in the outermost layers [14].
Previous reports described the cell cycle parameters
but none has focused on the progression of mitosis
[14]. Mitosis allows the segregation of the two lots
of chromosomes and finally the separation of the two
daughter cells. Mitosis is a highly regulated process
controlled by many regulatory complexes such as the
crucial passenger complex (aurora-B kinase, survivin, ... )
[15]. The cells must satisfy two successive checkpoints:
the spindle checkpoint that prevents the cells from entering
in anaphase and the noCut checkpoint that controls the
division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis) [16, 17].
In the present study, we report the presence of
bi-nucleated cells in multicellular spheroids and we
describe mitosis progression. The cell cycle analysis of
7 days old-spheroids indicated a decreased S-phase and a
stable 4N-population that represents mitosis-arrested and
tetraploid cells.
We set-up time-lapse experiments on live fluorescent
spheroids to follow mitosis. Direct live imaging has been
poorly explored on spheroids. Our study demonstrates
that the mitotic spindle checkpoint is satisfied since
chromosomes are aligned on the metaphasic plate, histone
H3 is phosphorylated on Ser10 and the passenger complex
is transferred on the spindle. Conversely, cytokinesis failed
as a consequence of the mis-orientation of the dividing
axis, giving rise to binucleated cells.
Despite unsuccessful mitosis, multicellular
spheroids are a suitable model for testing mitotic drugs
because their expansion is sensitive to pactlitaxel and
aurora kinase inhibitors. Spheroids, thus, represent a
highly relevant model for studying drug efficiency.

Presence of binucleated cells in spheroids
Murine, p53WT TSA/pc cells derived from a
mammary gland tumour were used for 3D-MCTS
production either in U-low binding 96-wells or by the
pending drop method. In both cases we identified a
significant proportion of bi-nucleated cells within the
spheroids (Figure 1A (a) and (b) respectively). The same
observations were made with Hek293 (Figure 1A (c))
and HeLa spheroids (not shown). The proportion of binucleated cells at the spheroid surface was 23.7, 28.2
and 24.0 % respectively for TSA/pc, Hek293 and HeLa
cells (Figure 1B). The proportions of bi-nucleated cells
increased by around 20 % when cells were grown as
spheroids compared to 2D-plastic cultures (Figure 1B).

Detection of mitotic markers
Since the presence of bi-nucleated cells is a
consequence of unsuccessful mitosis, we studied the
localization of important mitotic proteins and markers
(Figure 2). We performed immunofluorescence
experiments on HeLa cells either WT or stably expressing
survivin-GFP (Figure 2). Survivin is a member of the
chromosomal passenger complex that controls the spindle
checkpoint, first mitotic checkpoint [18]. Other members
of this complex are InCenp, borealin and aurora-B kinase.
In spheroids, mitotic cells were imaged. The chromosomes
are aligned on the metaphasic plate (Figure 1A (a)) and
the mitotic spindle appears normal (Figure 2A-2C). As
expected, survivin-GFP was located on the centromeres
and the aurora B kinase was fully active since it was found
to be phosphorylated in 100% of the mitotic cells (46 cells
scored) (Figure 2B). The phosphorylation of Histone H3
on Ser10 was also detected in 100% of metaphases (93
counted). This signal is absolutely required before the
anaphase can proceed [19]. As expected also, Ki67 was
decorating the metaphasic chromosomes (Figure 2C).
According to these data, we can conclude that the spindle
checkpoint is satisfied and that the anaphase can proceed.
Anaphases were detected in the spheroids (Figure 1A (c)
and Figure 2 (C-G)) and both actin and tubulin appeared
properly localized. Survivin-GFP was transferred on the
spindle (Figure 2C) and the phosphorylation of AMPKThr172 was detected on late anaphase as expected
(Figure 2F) [20]. In comparison to mitosis occurring in
2D cultures, we noted that some metaphases were not
perfectly round (Figure 2A) and anaphases appeared
in contact with neighbour cells (Figure 2D and 2E). In
anaphase, we often observed lagging chromosome and
chromosomes appeared twisted (Figure 2G).

segregation was finally not successful. The anaphase (T0)
gave rise to a unique cell with two nuclei (Figure 4A) that
appeared in two different z-plans (projection in Figure
4B). The absence of segregation was a consequence of
mitosis progression in the spheroid or at its surface. If the
same spheroids were allowed to spread overnight on glass,
normal separations occurred (Figure 4C). This suggested
that, in the spheroid, cytokinesis failure is either due to
the contact with the neighbouring cells or to unstretched
cytoskeleton in interphase.
To ascertain that cells escape from mitosis,
experiments were performed with Fucci-HeLa cells
expressing the two sensors: geminin-GFP and cdt1-RFP
[21]. Geminin is mostly expressed in late S-phase and
G2/M whereas Cdt1 peaks in G1 and declines after the
initiation of S-phase. These markers allow ascertaining
that the cells initially identified by their shape as anaphase
(Figure 3A) are really mitotic cells with two lots of
chromosomes (Figure 5A and 5B). The presence of red
bi-nucleated cells (Figure 5A and 5B) fits with the timelapse observations (Figure 3 and 4). G2/M-green and
G1-red binucleated cells were detected at the surface of
the spheroids (Figure 5A and B). The presence of red
binucleated cells confirmed that the cells escaped from
mitosis without segregation. In part C, a time-lapse was
performed on Fucci-HeLa cells. At T0, an anaphase was
selected (pointed with a green arrow) and imaged for
around 6 hours. We observed a movement of the future
daughter cells (compare 52 min with 2h) from the right
to the left. Finally, this mitotic cell gives rise to a large
non-coloured cell in early G1 phase (Figure 5C, 4h34 and
6h). When a similar experiment was conducted on FucciNMu-Mg cells, we did not observe any movement of the
future daughter cells pointed with a green arrow, for a
period of 1h23 (Figure 5D). Meanwhile, the increase of
polyploid cells was non-statistically significant in these
normal mammary gland cells (9.5 % ± 2.8 in 2D cultures
compared to 10.1 ± 4.5 in spheroids).

At the spheroid periphery, a cell in anaphase
identified by its shape was continuously imaged (Figure
3A). This time-lapse revealed movements of the two
daughter cells (Figure 3A, T0 to 41 min) and the rotation of
the division axis. Finally, a unique round cell was obtained
due to the absence of segregation (Figure 3A, 50 min to 64
min). This defect of separation of the two daughter cells
may lead to the presence of bi-nucleated cells in spheroids.
In order to better describe the mitosis, we performed
time-lapse experiments on HeLa cells expressing survivinGFP. Survivin is a passenger protein localized on the
centromeres as recalled in Figure 3C (T0). At anaphase,
survivin is transferred on the central spindle (Figure 3C,
35 min) and it lies on microtubules till the final segregation
(Figure 3C, 35 min). Survivin-GFP was detected within
the spheroids and time-lapse experiments were realized
as follows (Figure 3B). In each experiment, an area
encompassing one metaphase is imaged continuously
(Figure 3B). In 2D cultures, the spindle predetermined
the direction and the orientation of the future segregation
(Figure 3C). Within growing spheroids, the fluorescent
signal was found punctuated from T0 to 6 min. Then,
survivin was transferred on the spindle and was detected
as small rods (Figure 3B, t= 16 min and 19 min). Finally, a
clear midbody appeared (Figure 3B, t= 56 min to 83 min).
However the metaphasic plate (schematically represented
by the red arrows from T0 to 28 min) was found to rotate.
This is an unusual feature. Changes of orientation of the
midbody were also not expected (Figure 3B, t 56 min to
83 min). This rotation of the metaphasic plate (Figure
3D T0 to 18 min) and of the midbody (Figure 3D) was
observed in all cases (see field in Figure 3D). The changes
of orientation of the midbody are consistent with the
movements of the two daughter cells observed in Figure
3A (T0 to 41 min).
The transfer of survivin from chromatin to
microtubules indicates that the spindle checkpoint is
satisfied when the cells are growing as spheroids (Figure
3B). As expected, we therefore observed a decrease of
cyclin B in anaphases (Figure 3E), corresponding to its
degradation.
To better define these unexpected features, we
performed a time-lapse on cells expressing histone
H2A-GFP (Figure 4A). We could not work with a clonal
population that was too bright. For accurate results, we
worked with a population in which about 30% of the
cells were fluorescent. Early anaphases were selected at
T0 and continuously imaged. As shown in Figure 4A, the
two lots of chromosomes started to separate at 1 min, but
the orientation of the anaphase was different 2 minutes
later (3 min). At 8 min, the chromosomes were already
condensed and the cells started to segregate, however,

Role of fibronectin
One possible explanation for the mis-orientation of
the cytokinesis axis could be a lack of tension between
the daughter cells. We looked for the organization of
fibronectin, an extracellular matrix protein. TSA/pc
spheroids were expanded continuously (Figure 6A). When
mixed spheroids were prepared with tumour cells and
fibroblasts, they grew slowly and they were more compact
than spheroids made of tumour cells only (Figure 6A).
The detection of fibronectin indicated differences in its
organisation (Figure 6B). Surprisingly, TSA/pc-spheroids
did not assemble fibronectin at their border (Figure 6B,
TSA/pc-zp). The opposite could be expected since only
exterior cells were in contact with serum. In mixed

spheroids, the signal of fibronectin significantly increased
and it was detected on the whole spheroids (Figure 6B,
TSA/pc +F-zp). In mixed spheroids, cells were embedded
in fibronectin and the structure was compact but we still
detected binucleated cells (Figure 6C).

paclitaxel that prevents tubulin depolymerisation [23],
AZD1172 [24] and C5M [25] two aurora B-kinase
inhibitors (Table 1). In addition to aurora B inhibition,
C5M targets the noCut checkpoint by preventing AMPK172 phosphorylation [25]. The three drugs inhibited the
expansion of TSA/pc spheroids with IC50 similar to those
measured in 2D assays except for C5M. The IC50 of
C5M was 2.5 higher in 3D. Their efficiencies decreased
on ‘older’ spheroids, around 6 days post establishment, in
which less cells were in mitosis. The IC50 increased from
20 nM to 35 nM for paclitaxel and from 25 to 150 nM for
AZD1172. Although cytokinesis failed in spheroids, the
model was thus found relevant for screening different antiproliferating drugs targeting mitosis.
As a conclusion, we observed cytokinesis failure,
in different cell-spheroids, as a consequence of the
destabilization and mis-orientation of the segregation axis.

Cell cycle analysis
The analysis of the cycle revealed a decrease of
S-phase; this phase represented 9 %, on day 4 and 4 % on
day 7, for cells grown as spheroid (Figure 7). This reflects
the proliferation rate within the spheroids. Meanwhile the
4N fraction was still high (27 % on day 7 and 20 % on day
11) but it was accounted for by interphasic bi-nucleated and
G2/M cells. Moreover, the mitosis was found to be slowed
down as illustrated by time-lapses (Figure 4A). The sup >4N
fraction increased progressively to reach the initial level of
the cell line in 2D culture (Figure 7). These data suggested
that binucleated cells mostly did not enter in a new cycle.

DISCUSSION

Role of p53

Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems are
valuable tools for anti-cancer drug testing since cells
acquire morphological and cellular characteristics relevant
to in vivo tumours [2]. Among the different available
systems we chose the free-floating spheroid for its easy
handling and the possibilities of microscopy. We imaged
daily the spheroids grown in U-well plates, under live
conditions, and we followed each spheroid individually.
These spheroids assemble their own matrix and TSA/pc
spheroids grow exponentially for at least three weeks.
As also reported by other authors [26, 27], the analysis
of the cell cycle revealed a large decrease of the S-phase
within the spheroid that is consistent with a doubling time
of the whole population in around 7 days. This decrease
of S-phase did not fit with a quite constant presence of
G2/M cells. The presence of a large proportion of binucleated cells could account for this 4N-fraction. This
tetraploid population was observed in spheroids prepared
with different cell lines and even in compact spheroids
generated by addition of fibroblasts [28]. Polyploidisation
of cells grown in suspension was only reported, in 1982,
for chinese hamster V-79 cells which spontaneously
formed spheroids [29].
We decided to describe the progression of mitotic
cells at the periphery of the spheroid. Many different
imaging, like classical and biphotonic fluorescent
microscopy [30] and complex imaging such as light
sheet (LS), were performed on spheroids [31]. However,
to our knowledge, direct time-lapse experiments without
a reconstitution step have not yet been reported in
spheroids. We adapted to 3D-cultures the fluorescent
time-lapse experiments widely used in 2D-cultures by

In adherent cells growing in 2D, P53 was described
to be stabilized in bi-nucleated cells and to prevent the
proliferation of tetraploid cells [22]. Since the increase
of bi-nucleated cells was observed in P53 positive cells
(Figure 1), we describe the situation in P53 negative cells.
We prepared spheroids from genetically modified hct116
cells expressing P53 (P53+) or not (P53-). P53+ spheroids
grew faster than P53- ones similarly to results obtained in
2D cultures (Figure 8A). Immunofluorescence experiments
revealed, on both types of spheroids, the presence of
binucleated cells and the absence of larger polynucleated
cells (> 4 N) (Figure 8B). The comparison of cell cycle
of both spheroids did not reveal major differences and the
> 4 N fractions were very similar in both, even at day 11
(Figure 8C). In addition, we observed no stabilisation of
p53 in hct116 cells (data not shown) and in TSA/pc cells
(Figure 8D). These results and the lower expansion of P53spheroids compared to P53+ ones as well as the similar >
4N phases suggest that P53 is probably not involved in the
proliferation arrest of binucleated cells. This arrest could
only reflect the low proliferation rate within the spheroids
as illustrated by the decrease in percentage of cells in
S-phase (Figure 7 and 8C).

Test of antiproliferating drugs targeting mitosis
Spheroids are proposed as models for testing
anti-cancer drugs since they better mimic tumours than
adherent cells. Taking into account cytokinesis failure, we
questioned whether the system was still suitable for testing
mitotic drugs. We selected three anti-mitotic compounds:

acquiring images on a confocal microscope using a PlanApochromat 20X / 0.75 objective. As in 2D-cultures,
this technique allowed to describe step-by-step the
progression of mitosis. We found that the passenger
complex was well localized on the centromere and was
fully active. The spindle checkpoint was thus satisfied
and anaphase proceeded as accounted for by the transfer
of survivin-GFP on the mitotic spindle. Meanwhile the
two lots of chromosomes were separated. In 2D-cultures,
the anaphase cells had the same orientation as in the
former metaphase and the cytokinesis was thus already
oriented. At the periphery of the spheroids where most
division occurred, we observed continuous movements
of the mid-body. The absence of stabilization of the
furrow division and the presence of chromatin in the
segregation plane prevented the separation of the
two-daughter cells. After a long arrest, cells escaped
from mitosis and gave rise to a G1-binucleated cell.
We supposed that, because of an active proteolysis
and in the absence of transcription, some proteins
are in too low concentration for maintaining mitosis.
Cytokinesis failure was thus responsible for the increase
of binucleated cells. Conversely to what was reported
for 2D-culture, cytokinesis failure did not induce the

stabilisation of p53 and presumably did not activate the
hyppo tumour suppressor pathway [22, 32]. In spite of
these unsuccessful mitoses, free floating spheroids are a
valuable system for evaluating mitotic drugs even when
these drugs target late events.
Cytokinesis failure could be the consequence
of the destabilization of the axis of division. The axis
of division is influenced by the interaction of spindle
microtubules with cortical actin, by forces generated at
the cellular cortex and by the shape of the cell [33, 34,
35]. In fact, the distribution of retraction fibres during
mitosis constitutes a memory of the adhesion pattern in
interphase and controls the orientation of the spindle [36].
In the spheroid, we noted that few mitotic cells were not
round and had unusual contacts with the surrounding
cells. In many disease processes including cancer, cells
may lose their ability to regulate spindle orientation
[36, 37] giving rise to aberrant structures [38]. Cancer
multicellular spheroids recapitulate such a feature that was
not found in one example of normal mammary cells. More
investigations are needed for establishing a link between
the transformation and the polyploidisation of cells grown
as spheroid.

Accumulating evidence points the significant
contribution of tetraploid intermediate in the composition
of cancer genomes: about 20% of all solid tumours exhibit
tetraploid karyotypes [39]. Moreover bioinformatics
analyses on 4 000 human cancers revealed that about
37 % of all tumours, even with diploid karyotypes, have
undergone at least one whole genome duplication event
during their evolution [40]. Spheroids represent an
attractive model for understanding such events. Especially
as tetraploid cells are genetically unstable and can promote
tumorigenesis [32].

already described in [25] except that both cells are mixed
at the starting point.
Alternatively spheroids were prepared by the
hanging drop technic. Drops of 40 µL (around 10 000 cells
/mL, in culture medium with 10% FCS) were pipetted on
the lid of a petri dish containing PBS. The culture was
maintained for 5 to 7 days.
Spheroids were imaged in live conditions either
directly in the 96-well plate or upon their transfer into
coverglass Lab-Tek wells.
For measuring their expansion, spheroids were
imaged with a Zeiss510-confocal microscope, each day,
with a 10-X objective and then the area of the larger
section was determined for each spheroid by the Image
J software. Most experiments were done on 5 spheroids
alternatively on 3. Finally, at the end-point, the number of
live cells was determined by the celltiter Glo-3D kit under
conditions suggested by the manufacturer (Promega).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
HeLa and Hek293 cell lines obtained from ATCC
were cultured under the suggested conditions. HeLa cells
stably expressing survivin-GFP and Hek-293 expressing
histone H2A-GFP were already described [41] [42]. TS/Apc cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented
with 1% glutamine. Genetically modified HCT116 (P53+
and P53-) cells were a gift from Dr B. Vogelstein. FucciHeLa and Fucci-NMuMG cells expressed both cdt1-RFP
and geminin-GFP [21].

Cell cycle analysis
For determination of cell cycle profiles, adherent
cells were recovered and fixed by ice-cold 70% ethanol,
for 1 hour, and then, incubated with propidium iodide
solution (50 µg/ml) in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml RNase A
for 15 minutes, at 37°C. DNA content was measured using
the BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, US)
and CFlow Plus software.
Determination of the cell cycle of cells grown as
spheroids proceeded as follows: Five spheroids were
recovered by pipetting in an eppendorf tube, washed by
PBS then, transferred in a well of a 24-plate containing
trysin/EDTA, incubated at 37°C with vigorously shaking
from time to time. The dislocation of the spheroids is
followed under the microscope and the action of trypsin
stopped by adding FCS. Then, cells were recovered and
cell cycle analysis is performed as described above.

Compounds
Paclitaxel and AZD-1172 were supplied by SigmaAldrich. C5M was described in Le et al [25].

Multicellular tumour spheroid models
Spheroids were generated by plating either TS/Apc or HeLa or Hek293 or Hct116 cells, at 1000, 800, 500
and 1000 cells/well respectively, into ultra low adherence
-96-well plates (Corning, Tewksbury, USA). These plates
stimulate spontaneous formation of a single spheroid of
cells, within 24 hours of incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2.
Spheroids grew in complete medium as in 2D-cultures in
the final volume of 200 µL.
Mixed spheroids containing both TSA/pc tumour
cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were essentially prepared as

Cell viability assays
For 2D cultures, cell proliferation assays were
conducted in 96-well culture plates. Assays were run in
triplicate. Serial dilutions of compounds were prepared
and the viable cell number was determined, on day 4, by
28781

the addition of MTS (Promega). Two different experiments
were run. Dilutions are as follows: from 1 nM to 200 nM
for AZD1152 and paclitaxel and from 100 nM to 1 µM
for C5M.
For 3D cultures, the growth was determined by
measuring the maximal area of each spheroid and the
percentage of expansion at Dx equals (area Dx – area
D0/area D0) X 100. IC50 is the concentration that
decreases expansion by 2. At the end-point, the number
of live cells was determined by the celltiter Glo-3D kit
(Promega). IC50 values indicated in Table 1 are the means
of both types of determinations, when available. Drug
treatments were performed, on day 4 or 6.5 and repeated
on 5 spheroids. Three different concentrations were used
and, at least, two independent experiments were run.

was manual. Around 1 000 cells were analysed. For
3D-cultures, the quantification was performed on z-stack
images.

Time lapse
Ex vivo experiments were conducted on cells
grown on Lab-Tek chambered coverglass (Nalgen Nunc
International) and maintained under standard culture
conditions (37°C, 5% CO2). Spheroids were recovered by
pipetting just before imaging and deposited in the LabTek well containing cell culture medium. Images were
acquired on a Zeiss dynascope confocal microscope using
a Plan-Apochromat 20X / 0.75 objective. Images were
analysed with the Zen software provided by Zeiss and a
median filter (3/3/1) was applied to all images. At least
10 mitotic cells were simultaneously followed and three
independent experiments were conducted.

Immunofluorescence
Adherent cells grown on glass coverslips were
fixed by formaldehyde 4%, for 10 minutes, at 37°C.
Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described
previously [24]. Immunofluorescence experiments were
conducted on whole spheroids as follows. Several spheroids
were recovered by pipetting in an eppendorf tube, washed
by PBS then fixed by formaldehyde 4%, for several hours,
at room temperature or alternatively overnight at 4 °C.
Then, spheroids were washed by PBS and permeabilized
with PBS, 0.2% Triton-X100, for 30 min. Then, a saturation
step with BSA (0.5 mg/ml) preceded the incubation with
the antibodies (overnight with mild agitation). Finally,
spheroids were washed with TBS-tween 20 (0.5%) and
incubated with Cy2-, Cy3- or Hylite 647- fluorescent
secondary antibodies for 3 hours, at room temperature.
Spheroids were then imaged directly in LabTeck coverslips
or fixed with formaldehyde 4% and kept at 4°C.
The antibodies were targeted against the following
antigens: α-tubulin (Sigma, 1:1000), phospho-histone
H3-Serine10 (Upstate, 1:2000); phospho aurora kinaseA-B-C (Cell signaling technology (CST), 1:100);
phospho-AMPK (Thr172; CST, 1:100), phospho-myosin
light chain 2 (Ser19; CST 1: 100), mouse P53 (CST 1:
100), Ki-67 (Dako, 1: 100), Cyclin B (Santa cruz, SC245, 1: 100) and fibronectin (Sigma 1:500). Actin was
stained by either phalloidin-rhodamin (1 µg/ml) or
phalloidin-Atto 488 or phalloidin-Atto 647. DNA was
visualized with either hoechst 33342 (Sigma, 0.5 µg/
ml) or NucRed (Thermofischer, one drop in PBS for 15
min at room temperature). Images were collected with
a ZEISS 710 Laser Scanning Confocal microscope with
either a Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.75 or a water immersion
40 X objectives. Slices of 0.5 µm are shown as well as
3D-projections created by the zen software from Zeiss. A
median filter (3/3/1) was applied to most images.
For estimating the percentage of polyploid cells,
DNA and polymerized actin were labelled. Then, photos
were acquired with a confocal microscope and the scoring
