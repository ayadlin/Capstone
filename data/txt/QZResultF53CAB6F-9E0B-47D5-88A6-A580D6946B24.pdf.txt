BACKGROUND. The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been tempered by fears of detrimental effects
on cognitive function. Neuropsychologic testing was prospectively conducted
before and after PCI to evaluate its effects on cognitive function in patients with
SCLC.

METHODS. Ninety-six patients who completely or partially responded to initial

therapy underwent formal neurocognitive testing before PCI. Three patients who
had central nervous system metastasis were excluded. Of the remaining patients,
69 received PCI (mean dose, 25 grays [Gy] in 10 fractions). Repeat testing was
performed on 37 patients (median follow-up, 23 months; range, 6–120 months).

RESULTS. Baseline impairment was defined as 1.5 standard deviations below
the normative mean. Before undergoing PCI, 47% of patients had evidence of
impaired cognitive function. After PCI, univariate analysis revealed significant
transient declines in executive function (pre-PCI mean, 15.6  11.5; post-PCI,
27.1  17.6 [P 5 .008]) and language (pre-PCI mean, 33.8  9.9; post-PCI,
31.0  9.0 [P 5 .049]) at early timepoints. Controlling for noncentral nervous system disease progression the deficit in executive function was no longer significant. Moreover, these deficits were not sustained, and significant improvements
in language and motor coordination were recorded. On multivariate analysis, no
significant differences before and after PCI were found.

CONCLUSIONS. Neurocognitive testing demonstrated that a substantial portion of
patients with SCLC had impaired brain functioning at baseline. Persistent
declines in cognitive function were not observed after cranial irradiation. These
data do not favor the omission of PCI on the basis of fears of neurotoxic effects.

rain metastases are an exceedingly common cause of morbidity
and mortality in patients with cancer. Without intervention, up
to 50% of patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) will develop metastases in the central nervous system (CNS).1 Prophylactic
cranial irradiation (PCI) has been shown to decrease the incidence
of brain metastasis and provide an overall survival benefit to
patients with limited-stage SCLC in complete remission.2 Despite
recognizing a survival benefit of PCI, some practitioners have hesitated to use it, citing fears of radiation-induced CNS injury.3
To our knowledge, the majority of previous studies of brain
function in patients with SCLC treated with PCI have been retrospective and have failed to include baseline measurements of cogni-

tive function.3–6 Moreover, large prospective trials
have attempted to assess cognitive changes but have
been criticized for their testing methods.7 Traditional
indices such as the Karnofsky performance status
(KPS) are measures of physical but not brain function. The Mini-Mental Status Examination, used in
previous trials, is not a sensitive measure of cognition8 because it detects only profound dysfunction
and fails to measure subtle alterations in learning
and memory, executive functioning, and other areas.
In contrast, standardized measures of brain function,
which are easily performed, are both specific and
sensitive.9 These measures of neurocognitive function (NCF) are now being used as primary and secondary endpoints and to stratify patients enrolled in
randomized trials.
In the current study, we update the results of a
study that formally assessed NCF in patients with
SCLC who were treated with PCI.10 We prospectively
conducted neuropsychologic testing at baseline and
after PCI to evaluate the treatment’s effects on cognitive function. All patients enrolled were tested before
undergoing PCI. When possible, patients underwent
repeat testing after PCI at early and late intervals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study and Patient Inclusion Criteria
Between 1989 and 2002, patients with histologically
confirmed SCLC were enrolled on an Institutional
Review
Board-approved,
prospective
protocol.
Informed consent had been obtained from each
patient before enrollment. Patients who had previously experienced either a complete or partial
response to concurrent chemoradiation, radiation
alone, or surgical resection of their SCLC were eligible. Before undergoing PCI, all patients were restaged
with computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging of the brain. Results from 30 patients have
been previously reported.10 Herein, we describe
results of analysis of 96 total patients (including the
30 previously reported).
Primary Treatment Modalities
Twenty-one patients received induction chemotherapy before definitive treatment; 16 were treated with
cisplatin and etoposide, and 5 were treated with cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide. Seventy-seven
patients received concurrent chemotherapy (most
commonly cisplatin and etoposide) and thoracic
radiation. The mean thoracic radiation dose was 45
grays (Gy) (range, 32–66 Gy). Most patients were
treated with 1.5-Gy fractions twice daily. When single
daily treatments were used, the fractions were either

1.8 or 2 Gy. Fourteen patients underwent thoracic
radiotherapy alone. Three patients underwent surgical resection followed by irradiation, chemotherapy,
or both. One patient underwent resection alone and
another received intraluminal brachytherapy.

Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation
Cranial irradiation was administered using either
cobalt-60 or a linear accelerator-based treatment
with 6-megavolt photons (mean, 12 weeks after primary therapy). Sixty-seven patients received 25 Gy in
10 fractions. One of the remaining 2 patients
received 30 Gy in 10 fractions and the other received
24 Gy in 12 fractions. All patients received only 1
fraction per day. Concurrent chemotherapy was not
administered.
Neurocognitive Function Testing
Testing focused on learning and memory (Verbal
Selective Reminding Test and Benton Visual Retention Test11,12), executive function (Wisconsin Card
Sorting, number of perseverative errors, and Trail
Making Test Part B13,14), verbal and visual reasoning
(Similarities and Block Design subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised [WAIS-R]15),
attention (Digit Span and Arithmetic subtests of the
WAIS-R15), processing speed (Digit Symbol subtest of
the WAIS-R and Trail Making Test Part A14,15), expressive and receptive language (Controlled Oral Word
Association and Token Test16), and motor coordination (grip strength, grooved pegboard test, and finger
tapping14).
Baseline testing (after treatment of the primary
disease) was performed on 96 patients. Three
patients had brain metastases identified on imaging
at the time of baseline testing. Because metastatic
disease is known to lead to cognitive impairment,17
these patients were excluded from the analysis.
Repeat testing after PCI was conducted on 37
patients. For 3 of the 37 patients, the observations
were censored after CNS metastases were identified
on surveillance imaging. Disease progression was the
most common reason for lack of repeat testing.
Statistical Analysis
Normative population data were available for the
tests of cognition that were used.11–16 For the 93
patients included in the baseline dataset, raw test
scores were converted to Z-scores and compared
with normative data using a binomial test. Multivariate analysis was performed with a Bonferroni correction to account for the number of tests used.
For comparisons of cognitive functioning before
and after PCI, patients who underwent repeat testing

Univariate analysis of raw test scores obtained before
and after PCI was performed using the Student t test for
paired samples, with a 2-tailed test of significance.
Multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox
regression model. P values <.05 were considered statistically significant. The average number of post-PCI
repeat evaluations was 1.6. Stata 9.2 software (StataCorp, College Station, Tex) was used for calculations.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Baseline characteristics of the 96 patients who were
enrolled are described in Table 1. Patients with CNS
metastasis identified at the time of baseline testing
were excluded. The median age of the patients was
59 years (range, 34–77 years). The median follow-up
times were 23 months (range, 6–120 months) for all
patients and 48 months (range, 11–120 months) for
all patients still alive at the end of the study. Progress
of patients through the trial is illustrated in Figure 1.
Baseline Neurocognitive Function
Comparisons with the general population were made
using normative data available for the cognitive tests
employed. Baseline impairment was defined as 1.5
standard deviations below the normative mean, a
level at which only 6.7% of the population would be
expected to score. Before undergoing any cranial
irradiation, 47% of the patients displayed deficits on
1 of the neurocognitive tests. As shown in Table 2,
nearly 40% of the patients displayed deficits in executive functioning and learning and memory in at

patients throughout the trial. PCI indicates prophylactic cranial irradiation;

least 1 measure. Roughly one-third of patients displayed deficits in processing speed or motor coordination. No significant deficiencies were noted in the
domains of attention, reasoning, or language.
Previous studies have suggested that baseline
cognitive dysfunction may be predictive of poor outcomes.17 In our relatively small patient population,
baseline cognitive dysfunction did not predict for
worse survival or CNS failure (data not shown).

Neurocognitive Function After PCI
Sixty-nine patients underwent PCI and 37 were available for repeat NCF testing. Observations were censored for 3 patients in whom CNS metastasis
developed during the follow-up period. When possible, tests were administered in alternate forms to
minimize learning of the test (practice effects).

The results of univariate analysis by a Student
t test for paired data are shown in Table 3. Testing at
early timepoints, up to 449 days after PCI, revealed
significant declines in executive function (Wisconsin
Card Sorting Test: pre-PCI mean, 15.6  11.5; postPCI, 27.1  17.6 [P 5 .008]) and modest declines in
expressive language (Controlled Oral Word Association: pre-PCI mean, 33.8  9.9; post-PCI, 31.0  9.0
[P 5 .049]). When patients with disease progression
(non-CNS) were excluded from the analysis, the
decline in executive function was no longer significant (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test: pre-PCI mean,
17.0  13.4; post-PCI, 24.9  20.1 [P 5 .08]). Additional measures of executive function and language
(the Trail Making Test Part B and the Token Test,
respectively) did not demonstrate significant
changes. Patients who underwent testing at the later
timepoints (450 days after baseline) did not show

declines in NCF. Rather, significant improvements in
both expressive speech (Fig. 2) and motor coordination were found. On multivariate analysis, no significant differences were noted between baseline and
follow-up.

Patients Unable to Perform Repeat Testing
Thirty-two patients underwent PCI with baseline
NCF testing but failed to undergo repeat testing.
Among these patients, 13 had disease progression or
recurrence in the chest, 4 developed brain metastasis, 5 had non-CNS metastatic disease, 1 had severe
sequelae of thoracic radiotherapy, and 2 developed a
second malignancy (non-CNS). Seven patients
returned home for further care but were without evidence of CNS dysfunction at the time of last contact.
Attrition from the study was not due to cognitive
impairment secondary to PCI in any case.
As described earlier, there was a high incidence
of disease progression, and overall survival was significantly shorter for patients who did not undergo
repeat testing. However, no significant differences
were found in baseline NCF between those who had
repeat testing and those without (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Retrospective studies have suggested deleterious
effects of cranial irradiation on brain function. This
has lead to persistent concern over potential cognitive impairments secondary to PCI. We prospectively
followed patients with SCLC, formally assessing neuropsychologic testing before and after PCI. We found
no convincing evidence for long-term neurotoxic
effects from PCI. Instead, we found that a high proportion of SCLC patients have impaired cognitive
function even before cranial irradiation.

593

As survivorship for patients with SCLC increases,
potential late effects of PCI become more important.
Unfortunately, to our knowledge there are only limited data describing the long-term toxic effects of
cranial irradiation for patients with SCLC. Initially,
some studies suggested high rates of neurotoxic
effects associated with cranial irradiation.3–6 However, these studies were inherently limited because of
their retrospective design and lack of baseline assessments of neurologic and neurocognitive function.
Moreover, large fraction sizes and concurrent chemotherapy were often employed. As part of a prospective study, Arriagada et al.7 conducted standard
neurologic assessments, including the Mini-Mental
Status Examination, on SCLC patients before and after cranial irradiation. No significant differences were
observed in neurologic function. Unfortunately, the
methods used in that study7 are only powered to
detect overt deficits in neurologic function.8 Gregor
et al.18 followed patients prospectively with psychometric evaluations. Unfortunately, the battery of tests
employed was not comprehensive and failed to
include measures of executive function. Moreover,
normative population data were not used for comparison. Because of the paucity of prospective data,
investigators developing decision-analysis models
have been forced to account for potentially substantial delayed toxic effects.19
In the current study, we performed formal neurocognitive testing before and after cranial irradiation
as part of a prospective study designed to detect
subtle deficits in cognition. We used validated testing
methods powered to detect subtle cognitive impairment. Even with meticulous testing, we were unable
to demonstrate consistent long-term declines in NCF
after PCI. Rather, we found a high incidence of baseline cognitive dysfunction.
It is enticing to speculate on the etiology of baseline deficits. The deficiencies observed in the current
study group are likely multifactorial. Tumor factors
(subclinical paraneoplastic syndromes), chemotherapy, medical comorbidities, and steroid use and
other medications are likely significant factors.
Indeed, previous studies have shown that chemotherapy affects brain functioning.20,21 In the current
study, nearly all patients had received neoadjuvant or
concurrent chemotherapy with radiation therapy or
both as part of treatment of the primary disease.
Twenty-one patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Those treated with neoadjuvant therapy did
tend to display increased baseline deficits (data not
shown). However, because testing was performed
before PCI, not before any therapy, our study could
not address this. Also, to our knowledge, there are

594

data suggesting that even before treatment cognitive dysfunction is prevalent among patients with
several types of malignancy, including those with
SCLC.20,22,23 This may favor the contribution of subclinical paraneoplastic syndromes or other tumorassociated factors.
In patients who underwent repeat NCF testing
after PCI, univariate analysis identified declines in
single measurements of executive function and language. Although the changes were statistically significant, mean differences were small and the clinical
effects likely minimal. The most robust finding was a
decline in executive function, as measured by the
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, between Days 250 to
449. When patients with disease progression (nonCNS) were excluded from the analysis, the decline in
executive function was no longer significant. This
suggests that non-CNS disease progression, salvage
treatment, or both account, in part, for cognitive deficits. In addition, if deterioration of brain function is
due to treatment effects then a decline in NCF
should persist with time. In the current study,
patients who were able to undergo extended followup did not demonstrate a decline from baseline in
NCF. Moreover, multivariate analysis failed to reveal
significant changes in any measure.
In evaluating a prophylactic therapy such as PCI
it is necessary to weigh the potential risk of deficits
resulting from the treatment itself against the risks of
disease recurrence. In a large meta-analysis, PCI has
been shown to decrease the incidence of CNS failure
and provide a survival benefit in patients with limited-stage SCLC.2 Individual studies, underpowered
to detect overall survival differences, have demonstrated that PCI benefits disease-free survival and
brain metastasis-free survival.7,18,24 The potential
morbidity of CNS failures cannot be overlooked. Disease metastatic to the brain can be physically and
mentally debilitating. Studies have shown that
increased tumor burden is correlated with neurocognitive decline.17 Moreover, NCF is believed to be correlated with quality of life.25 Thus, in addition to
decreasing mortality, PCI may prevent excess morbidity by averting CNS failures.
The current study is limited by a small sample
size. With a larger numbers of patients, subtle deficits in brain function could be revealed. Unfortunately, outcomes for patients with SCLC remain poor
and long-term survivorship relatively rare. Thus,
long-term data are difficult and time-consuming to
obtain. Currently, to our knowledge, the current
study remains the only prospective study published
to date using an extensive battery of validated measures of NCF. Future research will focus on identifying

potential mechanisms of baseline cognitive dysfunction.
We conclude that PCI delivered in low daily fraction sizes, to a moderate total dose, is unlikely to significantly affect NCF. Given that PCI reduces SCLCassociated deaths and may potentially reduce cancer-related morbidity, we believe it should be offered
to all eligible patients.
