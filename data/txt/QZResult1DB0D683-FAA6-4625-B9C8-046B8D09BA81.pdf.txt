Abstract
Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has emerged as a
potent anticancer strategy. Bortezomib, a specific proteasome
inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of relapsed or
refractory multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma cell survival
is highly dependent on Mcl-1 antiapoptotic molecules. In a
recent study, proteasome inhibitors induced Mcl-1 accumulation that slowed down their proapoptotic effects. Consequently, we investigated the role of Bcl-2 family members in
bortezomib-induced apoptosis. We found that bortezomib
induced apoptosis in five of seven human myeloma cell lines
(HMCL). Bortezomib-induced apoptosis was associated with
Mcl-1 cleavage regardless of Mcl-1L accumulation. Furthermore, RNA interference mediated Mcl-1 decrease and sensitized RPMI-8226 HMCL to bortezomib, highlighting the
contribution of Mcl-1 in bortezomib-induced apoptosis.
Interestingly, an important induction of Noxa was found in
all sensitive HMCL both at protein and mRNA level.
Concomitant to Mcl-1 cleavage and Noxa induction, we also
found caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activation. Under
bortezomib treatment, Mcl-1L/Noxa complexes were highly
increased, Mcl-1/Bak complexes were disrupted, and there
was an accumulation of free Noxa. Finally, we observed a
dissociation of Mcl-1/Bim complexes that may be due to a
displacement of Bim induced by Noxa. Thus, in myeloma cells,
the mechanistic basis for bortezomib sensitivity can be
explained mainly by the model in which the sensitizer Noxa
can displace Bim, a BH3-only activator, from Mcl-1, thus
leading to Bax/Bak activation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5418–24]

Introduction
The 26S proteasome is critical for the maintenance of
homeostasis of most of intracellular proteins (1). A large number
of proteins involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis are
regulated by ubiquitinylation and proteasome-mediated degradation. Therefore, targeting proteasome pathway has emerged as a
promising approach to cancer therapy (2). Bortezomib (PS341,
Velcade, Millenium), a cell-permeable dipeptidyl boronic acid, is a
specific and selective inhibitor of 26S proteasome. Bortezomib is
the first proteasome inhibitor used for the treatment of relapsed or
refractory multiple myeloma (3), an incurable disease characterized

by an accumulation of malignant long-lived plasma cells. Clinical
trials comparing bortezomib with dexamethasone showed the
superiority of bortezomib in terms of response rate and survival in
patients with relapsed myeloma (3). Although bortezomib is able to
bypass drug resistance and synergize with some conventional
therapy, it was shown recently that bortezomib can trigger the
accumulation of antiapoptotic factors responsible for a protective
antitumor effect. This includes Mcl-1 antiapoptotic protein. Indeed,
it was shown that the intrinsic cytotoxic activity of bortezomib is
slowed down by the accumulation of Mcl-1 (4). Mcl-1 is particular
among the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members in that it is a short-lived
protein that is rapidly induced and turned over (5). In multiple
myeloma, the role of Mcl-1 can be distinguished from that of the
other antiapoptotic members because we have found that only
Mcl-1 antisenses trigger a rapid induction of apoptosis, which was
observed neither with Bcl-2 nor with Bcl-xL antisenses (6). Thus,
Mcl-1 seems as one of the key proteins in regulating multiple
myeloma cell survival. Both Mcl-1 mRNA and protein have a short
half-life in multiple myeloma cells (7). In multiple myeloma cells, a
large variety of stimuli (growth factor withdrawal, cytotoxic agents)
induce the disappearance of Mcl-1 that is associated with the onset
of apoptosis. In contrast, regardless of the apoptotic stimulus, Bcl-2
expression remains unchanged (8, 9). The disappearance of Mcl-1
can be explained by the combination of synthesis blockade,
proteasome degradation, and/or proteolysis by caspases (5). We
showed previously that Mcl-1 down-regulation is important to
make multiple myeloma cells susceptible to BH3-only proteins and
therefore to mitochondrial disruption (8). Until now, two different
BH3-only have been involved in apoptosis induction by bortezomib
(i.e., either the induction of the BH3-only protein Noxa or the
accumulation of Bik/NBK; refs. 10–12). Because Mcl-1 is the
essential survival protein in multiple myeloma and can be
accumulated by bortezomib treatment, we examined its regulation
and involvement in bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) technology was used in human myeloma cell lines
(HMCL) to assess the specific role of Mcl-1 in response to
bortezomib. The identification of the specific role of BH3-only
proteins in apoptosis induction by bortezomib remains unclear. We
found that Noxa contributes to apoptosis induction by bortezomib.
Therefore, we were interested in the study of Noxa interactions to
better understand its mechanism of action.

Japan). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FCS,
2 mmol/L glutamine, antibiotics (100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin), and 10 Amol/L 2-h-mercaptoethanol.
Antibodies (monoclonal antibodies) and reagents. Bortezomib was
kindly provided by Millenium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Anti-Mcl-1 monoclonal
antibody (mAb; clone RC 13) and anti-Bcl-2 (clone 124) mouse mAbs were
obtained from Neomarkers (Interchim) and DAKO, respectively. Antibodies
against caspase-3 (mouse mAb), caspase-9 (F7 mouse mAb), Bik (goat
polyclonal), and Mcl-1 (S19, rabbit polyclonal) were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Tebu-Bio) and caspase-8 from Cell Signaling Technology.
Antibodies against Noxa and Bak (TC-100) were from Alexis and Oncogene,
respectively. Anti-F1-ATPase and anti-Bim rabbit polyclonal antibodies
were obtained from Molecular Probes and Calbiochem, respectively.
Immobilized recombinant protein A-Sepharose was obtained from
Interchim and zVAD-fmk was from Promega.
Lentiviral vector construction for RNA interference. Two lentiviral
vectors, pLenti-CD90-sh-Mcl-1 and pLenti-CD90-sh-Luci, were generated as
described previously (13) to produce shRNA directed against human Mcl-1
(accession no. NM-021960) or firefly luciferase mRNA, respectively. Briefly,
they were derived from the pLenti6/V5-GW/LacZ plasmid (Invitrogen
Corp.), whose LacZ and blasticidin genes have been replaced by a marker
gene coding for CD90 membrane protein. In addition, they contain a
genomic cassette composed of H1 promoter plus sequence for shRNA

synthesis. Mcl-1 shRNA was designed to target the following Mcl-1 gene
sequence (ACGCGGTAATCGGACTCAA).
Virus production and cell transduction. Viral productions were done
following the guidelines of the ViraPower Lentiviral Expression System
(Invitrogen). Briefly, 3  106 293FT cells were transfected using the calcium
phosphate method with 9 Ag of the optimized packaging mix and 3 Ag
pLenti-CD90-shRNA. Virus-containing supernatants were harvested 48 h
after transfection and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. For titration,
serial dilutions of viral production were tested on 293FT cells that were
analyzed for CD90 expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
72 h after infection. We usually obtained titers ranging from 5  106 to
5  107 viral units/mL. To generate stably modified RPMI-8226 cell lines, 105
cells were placed in 200 AL of medium within a well of 24-well plate and
infected at a multiplicity of 8 with either Lenti-CD90-sh-Mcl-1 or LentiCD90-sh-Luci viral units. Ten days after infection, 80% of transduced RPMI8226 cells were identified by their overexpression of CD90 and sorted out
using FACS analysis. By this approach, we obtained a control population,
named shLuci-RPMI-8226 and another one, named shMcl-1-RPMI-8226.
Noxa RNA interference assay. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) used
to silence Noxa gene (Noxa siRNA) was N8 5¶-GUAAUUAUUGACACAUUUCUU-3¶ (14). Both siRNA and SilencerR Negative Control siRNA (AM4635)
were synthesized by Ambion. U266 cell line was electroporated using a
Nucleofector system (Amaxa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cancer Research
Briefly, 5  106 U266 cells were resuspended in 100 AL R nucleofector
solution containing 10 Amol/L siRNA and electroporated with T01
Nucleofector program. Cells were transferred to culture plates and cultured
at 5  105 cells/mL for 2 h before incubation with bortezomib.
Assay for detection of apoptotic cells. Cell death was assessed by
APO2.7 (Beckman Coulter) staining according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation. Flow cytometry analysis was done on a FACSCalibur
using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).
Caspase activity. Caspase activity was detected as described previously
(15). Briefly, cell lysates were prepared as described for immunoblotting.
Caspase activity was measured by following the cleavage of 50 Amol/L
peptide Ac-DEVD-AMC (caspase-3), Ac-IETD-AMC (caspase-8), or AcLEHD-AMC (caspase-9), respectively. The fluorescence of the cleaved
substrate was determined every 15 min using a spectrophotometer
(Fluorolite 1000, Dynatech Laboratories) set at an excitation wavelength
of 365 nm and emission wavelength of 465 nm. Fluorogenic peptides ACDEVD-AMC, Ac-IETD-AMC, and Ac-LEHD-AMC were purchased from
Bachem.
Immunoblotting. Cells (5  106) were resuspended in lysis buffer
[10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton
X-100] containing protease inhibitors. After 40 min on ice, lysates were
cleared by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 30 min at 4jC. Protein concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce).
Equal amounts of total protein (70 mg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE,
transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, and
analyzed following standard procedures. The signal was detected by
enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce).
Immunoprecipitation. Cells (25  106) were lysed in 1% CHAPScontaining lysis buffer. Whole-cell lysates were obtained, precleared with
Protein A-Sepharose, and incubated overnight with 5 Ag of the specific
antibody. The immunocomplexes were captured with protein A. Beads were
pelleted, washed thrice, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The presence of
immunocomplexes was determined by Western blotting analysis.
Subcellular fractionation. Subcellular fractionation was adapted from a
published protocol (16). Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and
incubated in hypotonic buffer [5 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.025 mol/L
sucrose, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 2 Amol/L aprotinin, 0.4 mmol/L pefabloc] for
30 min on ice. Cells were disrupted with a dounce homogenizer, sucrose
was added to 250 mmol/L and centrifuged at 500  g for 10 min to recover
the nuclear pellet. The collected supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000  g
for 15 min to obtain the heavy membrane pellet. The supernatant was
collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. Heavy pellets were lysed in lysis buffer.
Nuclear pellets were washed once in hypotonic buffer, sonicated in lysis
buffer, and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 30 min at 4jC.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. One microgram of
the total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Maloney murine leukemia
virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Amersham).
Quantitative PCR was done using the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Core
reagent kit and the MX4000 instrument (Stratagene) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The thermal cycling variables used were as
follows: 40 cycles at 95jC for 30 s, 60jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 30 s. To
control specificity of the amplified product, a melting curve analysis was
done. No amplification of unspecific product was observed. Amplification of
cyclophilin was carried out for each sample as endogenous control. Primer
sequences were 5¶-GCTGGAAGTCGAGTGTGCTA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CCTGAGCAGAAGAGTTTGGA-3¶(reverse) for Noxa and 5¶-CCCACCGTGTTCTTCGACAT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CCAGTGCTCAGAGCACGAAA-3¶ (reverse) for
cyclophilin. The relative expression ratio of the Noxa gene was calculated
according to the equation of Pfaffl (17) using untreated cells as reference.

sensitive to bortezomib (Fig. 1A). We observed that HMCL are
differentially sensitive to bortezomib; we found very sensitive
HMCL (z40% of apoptotic cells), intermediate sensitive HMCL
(>25% and <40% of apoptotic cells), and weakly sensitive HMCL
(<25% of apoptotic cells).
Several members of the Bcl-2 family are known targets of
bortezomib; thus, we studied the effect of 24 h of bortezomib
treatment on antiapoptotic (Mcl-1 and Bcl-2) and proapoptotic
(Noxa, Bik, and Bak) protein expression. Previous reports showed
that bortezomib exposure leads to Mcl-1L accumulation (10, 11). In
our study, all sensitive HMCL displayed Mcl-1 modifications at the
expression level. Indeed, bortezomib treatment induced either a
down-regulation (NCI-H929, U266, and RPMI-8226) or an accumulation (MDN and KMS-12-PE) of Mcl-1L. Strikingly, despite the
modification of Mcl-1L level induced by bortezomib, we detected a
cleavage of Mcl-1 as a general feature of highly sensitive HMCL
(Fig. 1B). In contrast, no Mcl-1 cleavage was observed in the weakly
sensitive RPMI-8226 or resistant LP1 and L363 HMCL. Bcl-2 levels
were not substantially affected under bortezomib exposure. Of
interest, Noxa BH3-only protein was strongly induced in all
sensitive HMCL but it was not detected in LP1 or L363. Bik levels
were not modified in any HMCL, suggesting that this BH3-only
protein is not responsible for bortezomib-induced apoptosis.
Finally, although Bak levels were not consistently affected in
all sensitive HMCL, a down-regulation was often observed. Thus,

Noxa and Mcl-1 Contribute to Bortezomib Apoptosis

Mcl-1 cleavage and a significant Noxa induction are crucial events
of bortezomib-induced apoptosis. To characterize the apoptotic
machinery mediating bortezomib-induced apoptosis, we next
investigated the activation (as detected by cleavage) of the
initiators caspase-8 and caspase-9 as well as of the downstream
effector caspase-3 (Fig. 1B). Activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and
caspase-3 was observed in highly sensitive cell lines after 24 h of
bortezomib treatment. By contrast, the weakly sensitive RPMI-8226
and the resistant LP1 and L363 HMCL did not exhibit caspase
activation.
Mcl-1 down-regulation sensitizes RPMI-8226 cells to apoptosis induction by bortezomib. To definitively establish the role
of Mcl-1 in bortezomib-induced apoptosis in myeloma cells, we
made use of RNA interference (RNAi) technology. We infected
RPMI-8226 cells with lentivirus for the delivery of shRNA directed
against Mcl-1 mRNA. shLuci-RPMI cells were generated to evaluate
the potential effects caused by siRNA synthesis and distinguished
them from the specific effects due to Mcl-1 down-regulation.
Immunoblot analysis of Mcl-1 showed that shMcl-1-RPMI-8226
cells were characterized by a down-regulation of Mcl-1 corresponding to 50% reduction compared with shLuci-RPMI-8226 cell

population (Fig. 2B). Only a partial down-regulation of Mcl-1
allowed us to obtain viable Mcl-1 silencing RPMI-8226 cells because
Mcl-1 is the essential survival protein for multiple myeloma cells.
Mcl-1 knockdown sensitized RPMI-8226 cells to bortezomibinduced apoptosis as detected by 35%, 24%, and 18% increase of
apoptotic cells at 5, 10, and 20 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 2A).
Moreover, when both shMcl-1-RPMI-8226 and shLuci-RPMI-8226
cells were treated by bortezomib for 24 h, the most significant
difference was the cleavage of Mcl-1 (Fig. 2B). This cleavage was
only observed in shMcl-1-RPMI-8226.
Noxa induction is essential for bortezomib-induced apoptosis. We did a kinetic analysis in MDN cells to characterize the
implication of Mcl-1 and Noxa in bortezomib-induced apoptosis.
The cleavage of Mcl-1 and the increase of Noxa levels were both
early events in apoptosis induction. Mcl-1 cleavage was caspase
dependent because preincubation with pan-caspase inhibitor
zVAD-fmk totally prevented the generation of the cleaved form
(Fig. 3A). Moreover, measurement of caspase activity (caspase-3,
caspase-8, and caspase-9) showed caspases activation as early as
4 h of treatment concomitantly to Mcl-1 cleavage (Fig. 3B). To
evaluate whether the increase of Noxa was due to an induction of

Figure 3. Mcl-1 cleavage, Noxa induction,
and caspase activation are early events of
bortezomib-induced cell death. A, MDN

bortezomib for the indicated times or
incubated with 50 mmol/L ZVAD-fmk for
1 h followed by 10 nmol/L bortezomib for
6 h. Cell lysates were subjected to
Western blotting analysis. Membranes
were probed with the respective
antibodies. B, caspase activity was
measured on cell lysates using
50 Amol/L Ac-DEVD-AMC (caspase-3),
Ac-IETD-AMC (caspase-8), or
Ac-LEHD-AMC (caspase-9), respectively.
Results were expressed in arbitrary units
(AU ). Points, mean of three different
determinations. C, MDN and L363 cell
lines were treated with 10 nmol/L
bortezomib over 3, 6, and 18 h. Noxa
mRNA levels were evaluated at these
time points by quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR. Noxa mRNA levels
are given in relative expression ratio
using untreated cells as reference and
cyclophilin as housekeeping gene.
D, knockdown of Noxa using siRNA
decreases bortezomib-induced apoptosis.
U266 cells were transfected with Noxa
siRNA or control siRNA, 2 h after
transfection, cells were treated with
10 nmol/L bortezomib for 24 h, and cell
lysates were probed with anti-Noxa mAb.
After 72 h of bortezomib treatment, cell
viability was determined by trypan blue
exclusion assay. Columns, mean of four

Figure 4. Disruption of Mcl-1/Bak complex and accumulation of free Noxa are
hallmark of cell death induced by bortezomib. A, MDN cells were treated as
indicated and immunoprecipitations (IP ; 1 mg cell lysate) were carried out with

was determined by Western blotting analysis, 5% of total lysates, and
immunoprecipitation supernatants were also analyzed. B, bortezomib-induced

transcription, we did quantitative, real-time PCR analysis. Eighteen
hours of bortezomib treatment triggered a 15-fold increase in Noxa
mRNA levels in MDN-sensitive HMCL, whereas it had no effect in
L363-resistant HMCL (Fig. 3C). This result suggests that transcription of Noxa plays an important role in Noxa up-regulation. To
determine whether Noxa played an essential role in bortezomibinduced apoptosis, we used siRNA to knock down Noxa expression.
Noxa siRNA inhibited the induction of Noxa by bortezomib
(Fig. 3D). The knockdown of Noxa provided protection against
bortezomib-mediated apoptosis in U266 HMCL (Fig. 3D).
Disruption of Mcl-1/Bak complex and accumulation of free
Noxa. It has been proposed that Mcl-1L forms constitutive
complexes with proapoptotic Bak that are disrupted in apoptotic
cells. To induce apoptosis, Bak should be released from Mcl-1
complex, probably displaced by Noxa (18). To address this
mechanism in multiple myeloma cells, we analyzed the endogenous complexes between the antiapoptotic and the proapoptotic
members and their modifications under bortezomib treatment. We
first confirmed that Mcl-1L was constitutively associated to Bak
(Fig. 4A). For the first time, we showed the presence of endogenous
Mcl-1L/Noxa complexes in MDN cells that express a weak
endogenous Noxa level. This result was expected because Noxa
displays a high specificity for Mcl-1L (19). After 7 h of bortezomib
treatment, we observed an increase of both Mcl-1L/Bak and Mcl1L/Noxa complexes. The Mcl-1L/Bak complexes became undetectable after 18 h (Fig. 4A). This may be due to the disruption of the
Mcl-1L/Bak complex. However, the combined analysis of both total
lysates and immunoprecipitation supernatants together with the
coimmunoprecipitation products suggests that the decrease of
Mcl-1L/Bak complex could be also explained by the decrease of
Bak induced by bortezomib treatment. Moreover, subcellular
fractionation into nuclear, mitochondrial, and cytoplasmic fractions showed that the decrease of Bak level was also evident at the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

mitochondria (Fig. 4B). It is worth noting that, despite the high
level of Mcl-1/Noxa interaction under bortezomib treatment, free
Noxa was detected in its respective immunoprecipitation supernatants (Fig. 4A). We also showed that Noxa is exclusively located
in the mitochondrial fraction either constitutive or accumulated
under bortezomib treatment (Fig. 4B). Thus, we can hypothesize
that free Noxa may induce, directly or indirectly, mitochondria
dysfunction.
Noxa induction could result in disruption of Mcl-1/Bim
complexes. Because we reported previously the relevance of the
disruption of Mcl-1/Bim complexes in myeloma cells undergoing
apoptosis (8, 9), we assessed the modification of these complexes
under bortezomib treatment. Endogenous Mcl-1/Bim and Bcl-2/
Bim complexes were abundantly found in healthy MDN HMCL. After
7 h of bortezomib treatment, Mcl-1/Bim complexes were barely
detectable, whereas the Bcl-2/Bim complexes were not modified
(Fig. 5). Although, analysis of total lysates showed no modification of
Bim levels and an accumulation of Mcl-1, Bim immunoprecipitates
revealed the disruption of Mcl-1/Bim complexes as observed by the
absence of Mcl-1 associated to Bim (Fig. 5). Because Noxa displays
very high specificity for Mcl-1 and was abundantly induced in MDN
cells after bortezomib treatment, we can hypothesized that Noxa
displaces Bim from Mcl-1 as suggested by the appearance of
abundant Mcl-1/Noxa complexes (Fig. 4A). Bim release may
therefore trigger mitochondria dysfunction. A model by which the
interplay between these Bcl-2 subfamily members determines cell
death under bortezomib treatment is provided in Fig. 6.

Discussion
Proteasome inhibitors represent a novel class of compounds
with promising antitumor activity. The clinical efficacy of the
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has been shown in the treatment
of patients with refractory and relapsed multiple myeloma and
other tumors (20). In this report, we show that bortezomib, at the
pharmacologic concentration of 10 nmol/L, triggers apoptosis in
five of seven HMCL, allowing to define sensitive and resistant
HMCL. Although effective as an antitumor target, proteasome
inhibition was implicated in the accumulation of the antiapoptotic
protein Mcl-1L (4), whose elimination has been proposed to be
required for apoptosis induction by different stimuli (8, 21). In our
study, regardless to the decrease or the accumulation of Mcl-1L

the ‘‘direct activator’’ Bim, which is now able to activate
Bax/Bak by a ‘‘hit and run’’ mechanism, triggering
mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.

induced by bortezomib in responsive HMCL, the cleavage of Mcl-1
was a hallmark of bortezomib sensitivity. Because the deregulation
of antiapoptotic factors by bortezomib could negatively affect its
antitumor effect (4), we explored the implication of Mcl-1 by RNAi
in HMCL. shMcl-1-RPMI-8226 were more sensitive to bortezomib
than shLuci-RPMI-8226. This result underscores the contribution of
Mcl-1 to bortezomib apoptosis induction. It is worth noting that
bortezomib increased sensitivity in shMcl-1 RPMI-8226 is associated with the generation of a cleaved Mcl-1 form, confirming its
relevance in bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Kinetic studies indicated that Mcl-1 cleavage was detected as soon as caspases were
activated. Moreover, pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk completely
prevented the appearance of the cleaved form, confirming the
direct involvement of caspase-3 and caspase-8 in Mcl-1 cleavage
(22). Consequently, Mcl-1 cleavage occurs following apoptosis
commitment. It has been shown recently that Mcl-1 cleavage
products have a proapoptotic function (5); therefore, their
induction under bortezomib treatment could amplify the apoptotic
cascade. Of interest, apoptosis in all sensitive HMCL was
consistently accompanied by the strong induction of the BH3-only
protein Noxa. In contrast, we did not find an up-regulation of the
BH3-only protein Bik, implicated previously in proteasomemediated apoptosis (12). Our results point out that both, the level
of Noxa induction and the cleavage of Mcl-1, clearly contribute
to bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Our results agree with Qin et al.
(10, 23) that showed bortezomib-induced apoptosis of melanoma
cells was associated with Noxa induction. Furthermore, Noxa
knockdown experiments confirmed the important role of Noxa in
bortezomib-induced apoptosis. We found that Noxa protein upregulation is due to an enhanced transcription of Noxa mRNA. This

last result agrees with the fact that Noxa does not contain PEST
sequences and that its high levels could not be only explained by
the inhibition of proteasome degradation due to bortezomib (11).
Recently, Chen et al. (19) have nicely depicted the high specificity of
Noxa for Mcl-1. Moreover, it has been proposed that up-regulated
Noxa promotes Bak activation by displacing it from Mcl-1 (11, 18).
Consistent with this model, after 18 h of bortezomib treatment,
we found a strong association between Mcl-1 and Noxa, whereas
Mcl-1/Bak complexes were no more detected. However, the
disruption of Mcl-1/Bak complex could be partially due to the
observed Bak decrease. We also found free Noxa under bortezomib
treatment, indicating that this BH3-only protein may contribute to
mitochondria dysfunction by itself as shown previously (24).
Furthermore, the exclusive mitochondria location of induced Noxa
is compatible with the involvement of this BH3-only protein in
mitochondria dysfunction. Of note, we showed for the first time
that endogenous Mcl-1/Noxa complexes are present in viable
HMCL, suggesting that Noxa is totally kept in check by Mcl-1 as
no free Noxa was detected in viable HMCL.
In addition, we have shown previously that in viable myeloma
cells, antiapoptotic family members sequester Bim. Among these
complexes, we showed that myeloma cell death is totally
dependent on Mcl-1/Bim complex disruption (8, 9). In the present
study, we found that bortezomib induced an early dissociation of
Mcl-1/Bim complexes. Because at the same time point Mcl-1 levels
remained constant, we can assume that the high amount of Noxa
induced by bortezomib is involved in the displacement of Bim from
Mcl-1 binding. According to the fact that Bim belongs to the
category of ‘‘BH3-only activators,’’ released Bim could trigger Bax/
Bak activation. In this context, the displacement of Bim by Noxa

under bortezomib apoptosis reinforces the model in which the
simple inhibition of antiapoptotic molecules is insufficient to
induce apoptosis unless a direct BH3-only activator of Bax or Bak is
present (25, 26).
Altogether, our results provide a better knowledge of the
mechanistic basis for bortezomib sensitivity in multiple myeloma
cells. They could also contribute to the design of novel therapeutic
interventions like sensitizer BH3 mimetic molecules. Of note, some
BH3 mimetic molecules are currently in preclinical development (27).
