Stage Migration and Increasing Proportion of
Favorable-Prognosis Metastatic Renal Cell
Carcinoma Patients
Implications for Clinical Trial Design and Interpretation

BACKGROUND: The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk model classifies patients with metastatic renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) by 5 pretreatment features as favorable, intermediate, and poor risk. The number of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center patients in each risk group was examined by year of treatment to analyze stage
migration. METHODS: The distribution of risk groups was examined retrospectively in 789 Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center patients with metastatic RCC treated in a first-line therapy clinical trial from 1975 to 2007. Date of
treatment onset was divided into 6 cohorts between 1975 and 2007 (1975-1980, 1981-1985, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, 19962001, and 2001-2007). RESULTS: The median age of the first-line metastatic RCC clinical trial patients was 59 years
(range, 20-82 years). Most patients received cytokine therapy (55%), 37% received chemotherapy/other, and 8%
received vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapies. Overall survival increased with each consecutive
cohort year group (P < .001). Median survival was 0.43 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-0.68) in the 19731980 cohort and 1.5 years in the 2001-2007 cohort (95% CI, 1.15-2.11). Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center riskgroup distribution shifted between 1975 and 2007 (P < .0001). The poor-risk group proportion became smaller (from
44% in 1975-1980 to 13% in 2001-2007), whereas the favorable-risk group increased (from 0% in 1975-1980 to 49% in
2001-2007). The intermediate-risk group remained stable at 50%. After adjusting for type of therapy, the shifts continue to be significant (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The risk-group distribution for metastatic RCC patients in clinical
trials shifted from 1975 to 2007. These shifts have direct implications for data analysis, interpretation of metastatic

Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is generally unresponsive to conventional chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Until recently, cytokines were widely used as first-line metastatic RCC therapy, and treatment with cytokines, such as
interferon (IFN)-a or interleukin-2, resulted in a modest response rate and a median survival ranging from 10 to 16
months. Pivotal phase 3 trials of sunitinib, temsirolimus, and bevacizumab (administered with IFN) showed superior efficacy compared with IFN alone, and have recently been incorporated into standard treatment.1-3 These angiogenesis-targeted therapies have resulted in an improved prognosis and a new paradigm for treatment of metastatic RCC.
Prognostic factors are used in metastatic RCC clinical trial design and interpretation, risk-directed treatment, and
patient counseling, and predictive models have been developed that have been applied to the conduct of clinical trials. The
model developed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center classifies patients as favorable-, intermediate-, and poorrisk according to the number of risk factors predictive of survival. These factors include time from diagnosis to start of systemic therapy of <1 year, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and corrected serum calcium levels, anemia, and low

performance status.4-6 This Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center model was independently validated by
investigators at the Cleveland Clinic has also been widely
used for the study and interpretation of cytokine and
targeted drug therapies, and the risk groupings have
guided treatment for a recently proposed nomogram
for metastatic RCC.7,8 For example, sunitinib or
bevacizumab þ IFN have been cited as preferred treatment options for metastatic RCC patients with favorableor intermediate-risk features. In contrast, temsirolimus
has been recommended as a preferred treatment option
for RCC patients with poor-risk features, based on a large,
phase 3 trial that was directed specifically at metastatic
RCC patients with poor-prognosis features.
In this retrospective study, we examined the relative
proportion of patients in our center’s database according
to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk class and
year of treatment. The patient population includes all
metastatic RCC clinical trial patients enrolled at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1975 to 2007.
Recent reports have indicated better overall survival (OS)
rates, and this serves as the primary motivation for these
analyses. This study aims to investigate shifts in the frequency of prognostic factors from 1975 to 2007. Any
shifts could be suggestive of a well-known phenomenon
termed stage migration. We first described changes in
known prognostic factors over the last 3 decades. We also
evaluated the proportion of patients in our database with
poor-prognosis features reported from the pivotal phase 3
trial of temsirolimus compared with IFN. In this trial,
definition of poor risk was expanded from that in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center model by the addition of a sixth risk factor, multiple sites of metastases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
All patients were treated on 42 consecutive Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Review
Board-approved clinical trials between December 1975
and June 2007. First-line therapy metastatic RCC
patients were included in this analysis. Patients treated at
institutions other than Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center (n ¼ 175) and second-line patients (n ¼ 260) were
excluded from analysis. In total, 789 patients were part of
this retrospective study. Table 1 provides the trial, agent,
number of patients, and dates of accrual for each of the 42
clinical trials. Eligibility details are described in individual
reports, but all included histologic confirmation of RCC;

348

stage IV disease with presence of measurable lesions;
adequate performance status; lack of severe comorbid
conditions; and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic
function.
Routine studies at the time of clinical trial entry
included the following: detailed history and physical examination, complete blood count, prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, creatinine, total bilirubin,
alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase lactate
dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, total protein, albumin, and imaging studies to assess measurable
disease.
Analysis
The primary aim of this retrospective study was to assess
changes in the proportion of patients in each of the 3 Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk groups from
1975 to 2007. The methods and development of the
model used to define risk groups with pretreatment features have been defined above. In summary, low Karnofsky performance status (<80%), high lactate
dehydrogenase (>1.5  upper limit of normal), low serum hemoglobin (<lower limit of normal), high corrected serum calcium (>10 mg/dL), and <1 year interval
from diagnosis to treatment onset, were defined as independent prognostic factors. Presence or absence of these
risk factors was used to stratify patients into 3 groups:
favorable risk (0 factors), intermediate risk (1 or 2 risk factors), and poor risk ( 3 risk factors). Risk groups were
assigned to 756 of the 789 patients. Thirty-three patients
did not have data on 1 or more of the prognostic factors.
Although these patients are not included in the main analyses, data from these patients are summarized when
available.
To examine changes in the proportion of patients in
each risk group, date of treatment onset was divided into
6 cohorts: 1975-1980, 1981-1985, 1986-1990, 19911995, 1996-2001, and 2001-2007. The proportion in
each of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk
categories (favorable, intermediate, poor) was calculated
for each group by treatment onset cohort. To determine
whether a trend existed, a multinomial logistic regression
with the 3 Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk
categories serving as the endpoint and the 6 cohorts
entered as 5 indicator variables was fit. Type of therapy
was included as a covariate to adjust for differences in eligibility criteria. Type of therapy was divided into 3 classes:
targeted, cytokines, and chemotherapy or other. Patients
treated with targeted therapies are the smallest group of

patients with each of the 5 known prognostic factors used
to develop the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center

The Cochran-Armitage test was used to determine the
presence of a trend in each of the prognostic factors from
1975 to 2007.

the 2001-2007 cohort. Although there is considerable
censoring in the more current cohorts, this indicates that
median OS has increased since 1975. We also found that
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk-group
distribution for metastatic RCC patients has shifted from
1975 to 2007 (Fig. 2, P < .0001). The proportion of
patients in the poor-risk group has become smaller (from
44% in 1975-1980 to 13% in 2001-2007), whereas the
favorable-risk group has increased (from 0% in 19751980 to 49% in 2001-2007). The intermediate-risk group
has remained stable at 50% of the first-line, metastatic
RCC patient population in Memorial Sloan-Kettering

Cancer Center clinical trials. After adjusting for type of
therapy, the shifts continue to be significant (P < .0001).
Table 4 shows the proportion of patients found in
each of the 5 risk factors by treatment year. The proportion of patients within each risk factor has decreased by
treatment year, with all Cochran-Armitage test P values <

performance status has decreased from 44% in 19751980 to 4% during 2001-2007. Elevated serum lactate
dehydrogenase level affected 24% of patients in 19751980, and decreased to 8% of patients during 2001-2007.

with low hemoglobin and time interval from diagnosis to
start of treatment. In a secondary analysis, a sixth prognostic factor was added to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center risk group, ie, 2 metastatic sites. A large
clinical trial of temsirolimus versus IFN, published by
Hudes et al, included patients with 2 metastatic sites
who also had 2 other risk factors and were defined as having a poor prognosis.1 This was done in that trial to
expand the target patient population, given that the number of metastatic sites had been reported to be related to
OS. When applying this sixth criterion to the current data
set, 185 patients changed from intermediate to poor risk.
Even using the additional metastatic site criterion, however, Figure 3 shows the proportion of patients in the

proportions calculated using the original Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center poor-risk criteria.

DISCUSSION
Our retrospective study observed changes in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk distribution for
metastatic RCC patients in clinical trials. Over time, there
has been an upward shifting of patients; the numbers in
the poor-risk group have shifted up into the intermediaterisk group, whereas numbers in the intermediate-risk
group have shifted up into the favorable-risk group. There
are proportionately fewer poor-risk and more favorablerisk patients in current treatment years. The intermediaterisk group has remained relatively stable numerically,
comprising half of the overall trial population. These
trends may reflect study eligibility and patient referral.
However, we also have seen that OS has increased with
each consecutive cohort year group (after adjusting for
treatment), indicating that risk-group migration based on
earlier detection and diagnosis may also be playing a role.
Although these data come from the clinical trial population at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and a
population-based study is warranted, our analyses suggest
that risk-group migration because of earlier and more precise detection and diagnosis of metastatic disease is an important issue to consider when designing new trials and
when interpreting clinical trial results.
These findings allude to a well-studied phenomenon, that is, that advances in technology, increased
screening, and better diagnostics can have an effect on
classification systems.45-47 For example, with better imaging techniques, smaller tumors and metastases are found
with higher frequency, and as a result, disease is diagnosed
earlier. In metastatic RCC, better imaging techniques can
have a direct impact on the risk-group stratification; more
good-risk patients will be identified, and over time, less
high-risk patients will be identified. More importantly,
the makeup of each group may change. For instance, with

351

Original Article

better imaging and earlier diagnosis, it is possible that the
poor-risk group will include only those patients with fastgrowing tumors, and thus patients with more virulent disease. Contrast this with the makeup of the poor-risk
group before advances in imaging, when the poor-risk
group was likely to be a mixture of patients with fastgrowing tumors and patients whose metastatic tumors
were silent in early scans.
There are several limitations to our analyses. Riskgroup stratifications based on multivariate models often
guide clinicians in assessing therapy options and provide
the basis for an informed discussion about prognosis.
However, these methods are often developed and validated in single-institution data sets, and require validation
and reassessment in other data sets. Study in other datasets
is important because other institutions may prefer different prognostic factors, reflecting a differing mix of
patients and diagnostic criteria. The patient sample used
for these analyses come from several trials at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. It is important to look for
similar trends among RCC patient populations in data
sets from other centers and cooperative groups. Another
limitation is that each clinical trial had slightly different
inclusion criteria. However, it is important to note that
the main, basic criteria were similar across the trials.
Finally, this is a retrospective review and cannot explicitly
investigate specific reasons for time shifts in the observed
risk-group distribution. Rather, these analyses are suggestive, and further analyses in population-based datasets,
such as that gathered by the International Kidney Cancer
Working Group Project,48 are needed. It is difficult to
measure the degree to which risk-group migration is a factor in these trends, but evidence from these analyses and
the experience of clinical trials in poor-risk patients indicate that it may be. These findings have implications on
trial design and statistical analysis. For instance, a trial
that targets poor-risk patients will become more difficult
to populate as this target population shrinks. In the large
clinical trial of temsirolimus versus IFN published by
Hudes et al,1 patients with 2 metastatic sites who also
had 2 other risk factors were defined as poor prognosis.
The original Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
poor-risk group does not include number of metastatic
sites as a risk factor, but this has been related to OS in
other publications. The addition of this factor increased
the pool of eligible patients for the temsirolimus trial.
A 2-arm randomized trial comparing sunitinib with
IFN showed that sunitinib has superior efficacy in achieving objective response and improving progression-free

352

survival and OS in 750 treatment-naive patients with metastatic RCC. A recent update and survival analysis showed
sunitinib was associated with longer survival compared
with IFN (median OS 26.4 vs 21.8 months, respectively,
P ¼ .051, unstratified log-rank test).49 The study was
powered based on historical data, to detect an improvement of 35.7% in OS. Per historical data, OS associated
with IFN had been reported to be approximately 13
months.3 However, the survival outcome for patients on
the IFN arm of the trial was longer than anticipated.
Results of exploratory analyses were consistent with the
hypothesis that survival was extended for patients on the
IFN arm by crossover treatment to sunitinib as well as
other anticancer agents after discontinuation.44 Also, the
long survival seen in the sunitinib arm is certainly because
of therapy. However, in both arms, given the findings in
our study, it is possible that part of the observed survival
effect may be partly because of stage migration.
In our analyses, we show that even by adding 2 metastatic sites as another criterion, the modified poor-risk group
declined over time (Fig. 3). It also appears that the gap
between these 2 poor-risk groups is getting smaller, indicating
that fewer patients with >2 metastatic sites are being identified. As mentioned earlier, these data provide evidence that
the face of metastatic RCC may be changing, which could be
because of better imaging and earlier diagnosis. This has an
effect on the eligible clinical trial population, and suggests
that further studies are warranted to identify prognostic features for patients in treatment with new targeted agents.
