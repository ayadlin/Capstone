ABSTRACT
TROP2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in various cancers.
Emerging evidence suggests that TROP2-targeting therapies are efficacious and safe
in patients with multiple prior treatments. TROP2 is a promising target for lung cancer
treatment; however, little is known regarding the association of TROP2 expression
with clinicopathological/molecular features, including prognosis, in lung cancer. We
examined consecutive cases of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), and
high-grade neuroendocrine tumor (HGNET) for the membranous expression of TROP2
using immunohistochemistry. High TROP2 expression was observed in 64% (172/270)
of adenocarcinomas, 75% (150/201) of SqCCs, and 18% (21/115) of HGNETs.
Intriguingly, the association of TROP2 expression with mortality was dependent on the
lung cancer subtype. High TROP2 expression was associated with higher lung cancerspecific mortality in adenocarcinomas [univariable hazard ratio (HR) = 1.60, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 1.07–2.44, P = 0.022)], but not in SqCCs (univariable HR =
0.79, 95% CI = 0.35–1.94, P = 0.79). In HGNETs, high TROP2 expression was associated
with lower lung cancer-specific mortality in both univariable and multivariable analyses
(multivariable HR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.020–0.44, P = 0.0003). Our results suggest a
differential role for TROP2 in different lung cancer subtypes.

(IMMU-132) is an anti-TROP2 ADC [11–18] that contains
SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. Without
severe side effects, IMMU-132 has been effective against
triple-negative breast cancer [19], metastatic small cell
lung carcinoma (SCLC) [14], and metastatic non-SCLC
(NSCLC) resistant to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy [15].
Lung carcinoma represents a group of histologically
and molecularly heterogeneous diseases [20–28]. The
major subtypes include adenocarcinoma, squamous
cell carcinoma (SqCC), and high-grade neuroendocrine
tumor (HGNET), which consists of SCLC and large

INTRODUCTION
TROP2 (also known as TACSTD2) is a
transmembrane glycoprotein that has high expression
in many cancers and is associated with patient survival
[1–11]. Emerging evidence suggests that TROP2 is a
promising molecular target for the treatment of various
malignancies [11]. Several ongoing clinical trials for
TROP2-targeting therapies are showing signs of efficacy
[11]. TROP2 has been used as a target of antibody-drug
conjugate (ADC) therapy [11]. Sacituzumab govitecan

cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). Even within
the same subtype, tumors display heterogeneous
characteristics. For example, alterations in cancer driver
genes differ between lung adenocarcinomas (e.g., EGFR,
KRAS, ALK, RET, and ROS1) [27]. Little is known about
the role of TROP2 in lung cancer [1–3, 11, 14, 15].
Because TROP2 is a promising molecular target for the
treatment of lung cancer, we examined the association
of TROP2 expression with clinicopathological and
molecular features as well as with prognosis of various
lung cancer subtypes, including 270 consecutive cases
of adenocarcinoma, 201 cases of SqCC, and 115 cases of
HGNET (74 cases of SCLC and 41 cases of LCNEC).

chemotherapy, and high TROP2 expression was not
associated with the status of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
SCLC (P = 0.67). In HGNET, the Ki-67 index (< 60% vs.
≥ 60%) was not associated with TROP2 expression (no/
low vs. high expression) (P = 0.61).

TROP2 expression and lung cancer mortality
Out of the 270 patients with adenocarcinoma, there
were 149 deaths, including 109 lung cancer-specific
deaths, during a median follow-up period of 13.0 years
(IQR: 9.1–15.5 years) for the censored cases. High TROP2
expression was associated with shorter lung cancer-specific
(log-rank, P = 0.025; Figure 2A) and overall survival (logrank, P = 0.023; Figure 2B). A univariable Cox regression
analysis revealed that high TROP2 expression was
associated with shorter lung cancer-specific (univariable
hazard ratio [HR] = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] =
1.07–2.44, P = 0.022) and overall survival (univariable HR
= 1.49, 95% CI = 1.06–2.13, P = 0.021). In a multivariable
analysis, however, the association was not significant for
both lung cancer-specific (P = 0.26) and overall survival
(P = 0.21) (Table 2). Next, we analyzed the association of
other covariates with patient mortality using univariable
and multivariable Cox regression analyses. The results
showed that p-stage (P < 0.0001), tumor differentiation
grade (P = 0.0013), and age (P = 0.043) were confounding
factors for TROP2 expression in lung cancer-specific
survival (Supplementary Table 1).
Out of the 201 patients with SqCC, there were 59
deaths, including 25 lung cancer-specific deaths, during
a median follow-up period of 5.0 years (3.1–6.3 years)
for the censored cases. High TROP2 expression was
not associated with lung cancer-specific (log-rank, P =
0.58; Figure 2C) or overall survival (log-rank, P = 0.36;
Figure 2D). A Cox regression analysis revealed that high
TROP2 expression was not associated with lung cancer-

RESULTS
TROP2 expression in lung cancer
We defined high TROP2 expression as intensity
1 with ≥50% expression or intensity 2 with ≥10%
expression in tumor membranous staining, as mentioned in
Materials and Methods section and presented in Figure 1.
High TROP2 expression was observed in 172 (64%)
adenocarcinomas, 150 (75%) SqCCs, and 21 (18%)
HGNETs using immunohistochemistry. Table 1 shows the
clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of each
lung cancer subtype according to the TROP2 expression
level (no/low vs. high). In adenocarcinoma, high TROP2
expression was associated with the male gender (P =
0.0018), larger tumor size (>30 mm) (P = 0.016), higher
pathological-stage (p-stage) (II–IV) (P = 0.012), and less
tumor differentiation (moderate to poor) (P = 0.045). In
SqCC, high TROP2 expression was associated with a
higher rate of well tumor differentiation (P = 0.040). In
HGNET, high TROP2 expression was associated with
the LCNEC subtype (P = 0.0013). Of the 115 cases of
HGNETs, only 22 cases of SCLC underwent neoadjuvant

Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate HR and 95% CI.
For adenocarcinoma, the multivariable model initially included age (< 60 years vs. ≥ 60 years), gender (male vs. female), smoking status (ever smoker vs.
never smoker), tumor differentiation grade (well vs. moderate-poor), pathological stage (p-stage) (I vs. II–IV), EGFR status (wild type vs. mutant), KRAS
status (wild type vs. mutant), and ALK rearrangement status (negative vs. positive). For SqCC, the multivariable model initially included age (< 60 years
vs. ≥ 60 years), gender (male vs. female), smoking history (smoking index ≥ 400 vs. < 400), tumor differentiation grade (well vs. moderate-poor), and
p-stage (I vs. II–IV). For HGNET, the multivariable model initially included age (< 60 years vs. ≥ 60 years), gender (male vs. female), smoking history
(smoking index ≥ 400 vs. < 400), p-stage (I vs. II–IV), histology (SCLC vs. LCNEC), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs. no), and adjuvant chemotherapy
(yes vs. no).
We created missing categories for any missing variables. A backward stepwise elimination with a threshold of P = 0.05 was performed to determine the
variables for the final model.

associated with longer lung cancer-specific (log-rank, P
= 0.024; Figure 2E) and overall survival (log-rank, P =
0.073; Figure 2F). A univariable Cox regression analysis
revealed that high TROP2 expression was associated
with longer lung cancer-specific (univariable HR = 0.23,
95% CI = 0.037–0.74, P = 0.0096) and overall survival
(univariable HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.21–1.02, P = 0.057).
A multivariable analysis also showed that high TROP2
expression was associated with longer lung cancerspecific (multivariable HR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.020–0.44,
P = 0.0003) and overall survival (multivariable HR =
0.30, 95% CI = 0.12–0.65, P = 0.0015) (Table 2).

We examined the association of TROP2 expression
in tumors with clinicopathological/molecular features
and with prognosis of various lung cancer subtypes,
including adenocarcinoma, SqCC, and HGNET (SCLC
and LCNEC). The association of high TROP2 expression
with prognosis varied based on the lung cancer subtype. In
adenocarcinoma, high TROP2 expression was associated
with higher patient mortality. In SqCC, high TROP2
expression was not associated with mortality. In HGNET,
high TROP2 expression was unexpectedly associated with
lower patient mortality. This study suggests a differential
role for TROP2 in different lung cancer subtypes.

and prognosis in lung cancer subtypes. Kobayashi et al.
reported that TROP2 overexpression was associated with
higher overall mortality in 130 patients with small-sized
(< 2cm) lung adenocarcinoma (P = 0.056) [1]. Li et al.
showed an association of high TROP2 expression with
poor prognosis (P = 0.046) in 68 cases of adenocarcinoma
and demonstrated that TROP2 overexpression enhanced
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in the lung
adenocarcinoma cell line A549 [3]. In contrast, Pak et al.
reported that TROP2 overexpression resulted in a better
overall survival in 100 patients with lung adenocarcinoma
(P = 0.02) and showed a tendency toward better overall
survival in 64 patients with SqCC (P = 0.49) [2]. To the
best of our knowledge, our study is the first to examine
the prognostic association of TROP2 expression in
HGNET (SCLC and LCNEC). In addition, our study
used the largest sample sizes of lung adenocarcinoma and
SqCC to examine TROP2 expression. We demonstrated
that high TROP2 expression was related to differential
prognoses based on the lung cancer subtype. High TROP2
expression was associated with higher mortality in lung
adenocarcinoma, was not associated with mortality
in SqCC, and was associated with lower mortality in
HGNET. Similarly, PD-L1 positivity was associated
with higher mortality in lung adenocarcinoma [29–31],
whereas PD-L1 positivity was related to lower mortality
in SCLC [32, 33]. Thus, PD-L1 and TROP2 appear to play
different roles depending on the lung cancer subtype. Of
interest, high TROP2 expression was significantly more
frequent in LCNEC than in SCLC. Emerging evidence
suggests that LCNEC is a biologically heterogeneous
group, containing SCLC-phenotype/NSCLC-phenotype
[34] and YAP1-negative group/YAP1-positive group[35].
There may be an association of high TROP2 expression
in LCNEC with SCLC-phenotype/NSCLC-phenotype
or YAP1 expression. Because the Ki-67 index was not
substantially different according to the TROP2 expression
level (no/low vs. high) in HGNET, the other mechanisms
except for proliferation, including SCLC-phenotype/
NSCLC-phenotype or YAP1 expression, might explain
the differential clinicopathological differences according
to the TROP2 expression level in HGNET. The use of
different downstream signaling pathways may explain
the divergent associations of TROP2 expression with
prognosis for adenocarcinoma and SqCC [36]. Further
studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms
accounting for differential clinicopathological associations
according to tumor histological subtypes.
We also determined the prevalence of high TROP2
expression and its association with clinicopathological/
molecular features in different lung cancer subtypes. A
high proportion of patients with adenocarcinoma (64%)
and SqCC (75%) showed high TROP2 expression,
suggesting that therapies targeting TROP2 may be
effective. However, a low proportion of high TROP2
expression was observed in HGNET tumors (18%),
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggesting that the probability of good clinical response
of HGNET to this type of therapy may be low, although
that of TROP2-expressing HGNET may be high. In
adenocarcinoma, high TROP2 expression was associated
with the male gender, larger tumor size, advanced stage,
and less tumor differentiation but not with genetic
alterations in EGFR, KRAS, or ALK. In HGNET, 34%
(14/41) of LCNEC and 9.5% (7/74) of SCLC tumors
showed high TROP2 expression. This information must be
useful for the development of therapies targeting TROP2.
A growing body of evidence suggests that TROP2
is a promising molecular target for the treatment of
various malignancies [11]. IMMU-132 is an anti-TROP2
ADC that has been shown to be effective against various
cancers without severe side effects in various cancers
[11–18], including metastatic SCLC [14] and NSCLC
resistant to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy [15]. Because little
data are available on TROP2 expression in lung cancer,
our data are valuable for establishing the utility of TROP2targeting therapies.
Our study had limitations that need to be
stated. First, there is no standardized method for the
immunohistochemical assessment of TROP2 expression
in tumors, which may influence the reproducibility of the
results. We evaluated membranous TROP2 expression
in cancer cells because this assessment is required to
predict the efficacy of molecular-targeted therapies for
lung cancer. However, some studies evaluated both
membranous and cytoplasmic TROP2 expression, which
could yield conflicting results as to the association of
TROP2 expression with clinicopathological/prognostic
features. In our study, two pathologists conducted a blinded
and independent assessment of TROP2 expression with
a good interobserver agreement. Second, we used tissue
microarrays to evaluate TROP2 expression in tumors.
Intratumoral heterogeneity is a characteristic of lung
cancer; thus, tumors with heterogeneous TROP2 expression
can affect the results. We speculate that this potential
misclassification of tumors based on TROP2 expression
would be randomly dispersed; therefore, null results would
have been yielded. Nonetheless, we have shown statistically
significant results. In addition, an experienced pulmonary
pathologist (KI) chose each core site with a relatively
large diameter (2 mm) based on the most histologically
representative region of the tumor to minimize the chance
of this potential misclassification affecting the results.
Third, the difference of follow-up periods among the three
subtypes might be a potential confounder of our results.
Nonetheless, we monitored survivors for the median
(interquartile range) of 13.0 years (9.1–15.5 years) in
adenocarcinoma, 5.0 years (3.1–6.3 years) in SqCC, and
5.8 years (3.1–8.2 years) in HGNET. Therefore, less time
between surgery and death in SqCC and HGNET did not
appear to affect our results substantially. Fourth, the total
number of patients, especially those with HGNET (N
= 115), was not sufficient, and the statistical power was
28731

therefore limited. Fifth, our database was retrospectively
created. Finally, we only enrolled Japanese patients at a
single cancer hospital. Therefore, additional studies in other
patient populations are needed.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the prognostic
association of high TROP2 expression differed according
to lung cancer subtypes. Although high TROP2
expression was associated with higher mortality in lung
adenocarcinoma, it was associated with lower mortality
in HGNET, and was not associated with mortality in
SqCC. We also determined the prevalence of high TROP2
expression and its association with clinicopathological/
molecular features in these lung cancer subtypes. This
information is beneficial for determining the utility of
TROP2-targeting therapy. Additional large-scale studies
are required to confirm our findings.

paraffin blocks using a 2 mm-diameter coring needle and
transferred the tissue to the array in the recipient block
using a manual tissue arrayer (KIN-1; Azumaya, Tokyo,
Japan). For each tumor, an experienced pulmonary
pathologist (KI) selected one site exhibiting the most
representative histology for that tumor [42].
Sections with a thickness of 4 μm were
immunostained for TROP2 with an anti-TROP2 mouse
monoclonal antibody (clone: 1E5-1E2, Daiichi Sankyo
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; diluted 1:400) using the Leica
Bond III automated system (Leica Biosystems Melbourne
Pty Ltd., Australia). This monoclonal antibody recognizes
an epitope in the extracellular domain (Mer1-Thr274) of
human TROP2. The sections were incubated at pH 6 for
10 min at 100°C. TROP2 expression on the membranes of
tumor cells was interpreted by an experienced pulmonary
pathologist (KI) in a blinded manner. The intensity of
TROP2 membranous staining in tumor cells was defined
as 0 (absent), 1 (weak to moderate), or 2 (strong) (Figure
1). We calculated the percentage of tumor cells at each
TROP2 intensity level. For the statistical analyses, we
categorized the specimens into two groups based on the
staining intensity and percentage of positive cells: no/
low TROP2 expression (Intensity 1 < 50% and Intensity
2 < 10%) and high TROP2 expression (Intensity 1 ≥ 50%
or Intensity 2 ≥ 10%). A random sample set of 127 cases
of lung adenocarcinoma, all 201 cases of SqCC, and all
115 cases of HGNET were blindly examined by a second
pathologist (YY). There were high concordances between
the two observers, as evidenced by a kappa of 0.66 (95%
CI = 0.53–0.79; P < 0.0001) for adenocarcinoma, 0.60
(95% CI = 0.47–0.73;P < 0.0001) for SqCC, and 0.63
(95% CI = 0.45–0.81; P < 0.0001) for HGNET. In addition,
to assess intratumoral heterogeneity of TROP2 expression,
we immunostained TROP2 using whole sections from
20, 15, and 12 cases of adenocarcinoma, SqCC, and
HGNET (6 SCLCs and 6 LCNECs), respectively and did
not observe substantial intratumoral heterogeneity in any
cases in terms of tumor TROP2 expression.
For HGNET, we also conducted immunostaining
for Ki-67 (MIB-1, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; diluted
1:200) using the Leica Bond III automated system (Leica
Biosystems Melbourne Pty Ltd.). The tumor Ki-67 index
was calculated by an experienced pulmonary pathologist
(KI) in a blinded manner. For the statistical analysis, we
categorized the specimens into two groups by the Ki-67
index of 60%, which is a median of all HGNET cases (<
60% vs. ≥ 60%). All 115 cases of HGNET were blindly
examined by a second pathologist (YY) with a high
concordance between the two observers, as evidenced by
a kappa of 0.66 (95% CI = 0.53–0.79; P < 0.0001).
For negative and positive controls, we used a cell
array (provided by Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan). This cell array consisted of cell line Calu-6
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) showing very low (below
the detection limit) TROP2 expression and N-87 (ATCC)

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
We examined 270 consecutive cases of lung
adenocarcinoma, 201 cases of SqCC, and 115 cases of
HGNET (74 SCLC cases and 41 LCNEC cases) to assess
the TROP2 expression in tumors and survival. Lung
adenocarcinoma, SqCC, and HGNET were surgically
resected between April 1995 and January 2002, between
April 2005 and February 2014, and between July 1990
and November 2014, respectively, at The Cancer Institute
Hospital, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research
(JFCR) in Tokyo, Japan. Patients were observed until
death or December 1, 2015. For the assessment of
smoking history, we used a smoking index (SI) calculated
by multiplying the “number of cigarettes per day” by
“duration in years.” This study was approved by the
institutional review board of JFCR, and informed consent
was obtained from all patients included in this study.

Pathological evaluation
Pathological diagnoses were made by experienced
expert pulmonary pathologists (KI and YI), essentially
based on the 2015 WHO classification of lung tumors
[37]. Tumor differentiation grades were defined according
to the Japanese Lung Cancer Society criteria [38, 39]. All
patients were pathologically staged according to the 7th
edition of the AJCC-TNM staging system [40].

Immunohistochemistry for TROP2 and Ki-67
Membranous TROP2 expression of tumor cells
was evaluated by an immunohistochemical analysis of
tissue microarrays. Using the archived surgical specimens
used for initial pathological diagnoses of primary lung
cancers, we constructed tissue microarrays as previously
described [41]. Briefly, we punched points of the donor

was performed using Calu-6 as a specific negative control
and N-87 as a positive control. Sections processed with
replacement of primary antibody by Dako REAL™
Antibody Diluent (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) were also
used as a non-specific negative control.

status (wild type vs. mutant), and ALK rearrangement
status (negative vs. positive). For SqCC, the multivariable
model initially included age (< 60 years vs. ≥ 60 years),
gender (male vs. female), smoking history (smoking index
≥ 400 vs. < 400), tumor differentiation grade (well vs.
moderate-poor), and p-stage (I vs. II–IV). For HGNET,
the multivariable model initially included age (< 60 years
vs. ≥ 60 years), gender (male vs. female), smoking history
(smoking index ≥ 400 vs. < 400), p-stage (I vs. II–IV),
histology (SCLC vs. LCNEC), neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(yes vs. no), and adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs. no).
We created missing categories for any missing variable,
if applicable. A backward stepwise elimination was
performed using a P = 0.05 threshold to select variables for
the final model. The proportionality of hazards assumption
in each subtype was confirmed using the graphs of the
log(-log[survival probability]) vs. log of survival time to
visually assess if the lines were approximately parallel.

Detection of EGFR and KRAS mutations and
ALK fusion
Tumor specimens were snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen typically within 20 min after surgical resection
and stored at −80°C until use. DNA was extracted using
a standard proteinase K digestion and phenol-chloroform
extraction. For analysis of the EGFR mutation, we
examined four exons (exons 18–21) that code for the
tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene. For exons
18 (G719X), 20 (S768I and T790M), and 21 (L858R
and L861Q), the TaqManTM SNP Genotyping Assay kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For exon 19
deletion and exon 20 insertion, a fragment analysis was
conducted, as previously described [43]. For the analysis
of KRAS mutation, we performed direct sequencing assays
for codons 12, 13, and 61, as previously described [43].
For detection of ALK fusion, we performed
immunohistochemistry using an anti-ALK mouse
monoclonal antibody (clone: 5A4, Leica Biosystems
Newcastle Ltd., UK; diluted 1:50) and the Leica Bond III
automated system (Leica Biosystems Melbourne Pty Ltd).
The sections were incubated at pH 9 for 30 min at 100°C.
In the ALK-positive tumors, ALK fusions were confirmed
by fluorescence in situ hybridization, as previously
described [27].

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using the
JMP statistical software package 12 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA) and Excel 2013 software (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA, USA). All P-values were two-sided. The
statistical significance level was set to P = 0.05.
To investigate the association of TROP2 expression
with clinicopathological and molecular features in lung
cancer, we used the chi-square or Fisher’s exact test as
appropriate.
The Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test were
used for survival analyses. For the analysis of lung cancerspecific mortality, deaths as a result of other causes were
censored. We also used univariable and multivariable Cox
proportional hazards regression models to calculate HR for
mortality according to the TROP2 expression level. For
adenocarcinoma, the multivariable model initially included
age (< 60 years vs. ≥ 60 years), gender (male vs. female),
smoking status (ever smoker vs. never smoker), tumor
differentiation grade (well vs. moderate-poor), p-stage
(I vs. II–IV), EGFR status (wild type vs. mutant), KRAS
