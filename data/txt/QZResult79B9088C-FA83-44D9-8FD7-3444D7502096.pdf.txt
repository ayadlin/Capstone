ABSTRACT
Background: Mucin glycoprotein 1 (MUC1) is a glycosylated transmembrane
protein on epithelial cells. We investigate MUC1 as a therapeutic target in Barrett’s
epithelium (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and provide proof of concept
for a light based therapy targeting MUC1.
Results: MUC1 was present in 21% and 30% of significantly enriched pathways
comparing BE and EA to squamous epithelium respectively. MUC1 gene expression was
x2.3 and x2.2 higher in BE (p=<0.001) and EA (p=0.03). MUC1 immunohistochemical
expression increased during progression to EA and followed tumor invasion. HuHMFG1
based photosensitive antibody drug conjugates (ADC) showed cell internalization,
MUC1 selective and light-dependent cytotoxicity (p=0.0006) and superior toxicity
over photosensitizer alone (p=0.0022).
Methods: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) evaluated pathways during BE
and EA development and quantified MUC1 gene expression. Immunohistochemistry
and flow cytometry evaluated the anti-MUC1 antibody HuHMFG1 in esophageal
cells of varying pathological grade. Confocal microscopy examined HuHMFG1
internalization and HuHMFG1 ADCs were created to deliver a MUC1 targeted
phototoxic payload.
Conclusions: MUC1 is a promising target in EA. Molecular and light based targeting
of MUC1 with a photosensitive ADC is effective in vitro and after development may
enable treatment of locoregional tumors endoscopically.

clinical importance. Within the field of esophagogastric
adenocarcinoma HER2 is the only therapeutic biomarker
to be incorporated into widespread clinical practice.
The HER2-targeting antibody Trastuzumab when used
in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to
improve progression-free and overall survival in HER2
positive gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer
patients [5]. HER2 overexpression occurs in approximately
13-23% of esophagogastric cancers but expression can be
heterogeneous [6, 7]. An ideal therapeutic target would be
stable and present in a higher proportion of tumors.
The mucin MUC1 is a densely glycosylated
transmembrane protein anchored to the apical surface
of many epithelia including the breast, ovary, pancreas,
airway and gastrointestinal tract. The extracellular
subunit of MUC1 has a ‘variable number tandem repeat’
(VNTR) region which consists of a repeating 20 amino
acid sequence mediating heavy O-linked glycosylation
[8]. MUC1 has an important extracellular role in cell
surface lubrication and the clearance of debris and
pathogens. Its intracellular signaling is linked to the ErbB,
fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 and p53 pathways,
which are implicated in cancer development [9]. MUC1
is overexpressed in a diverse range of carcinomas.
In progression to cancer, MUC1 protein expression
generally increases, alters location and is coupled with
aberrant glycosylation [8, 10]. Previous studies of
MUC1 expression in the premalignant changes of EA are
inconsistent [11–13]. Up-regulation of MUC1 has been
linked to bile acids exposure in gastroesophageal reflux,
a condition connected to the development of Barrett’s
epithelium and EA [14]. Others have associated a single
nucleotide polymorphism in the MUC1 gene to a reduced
risk of other upper gastrointestinal cancers [15].
HuHMFG1 is an antibody against MUC1 that has
been tested in clinical trials for breast cancer [16–18].
Targeting using HuHMFG1 was ineffective alone but the
antibody was well tolerated and had a good safety profile
[19]. Later studies used the radiolabeled anti-MUC1
antibody (yttrium-90-AS1402) in ovarian cancer after
de-bulking surgery. Administration led to endogenous
production of anti-MUC1 IgG in some patients, but there
was no survival benefit in those in whom this occurred
[20]. HuHMFG1 undergoes cell internalization [21] and
was considered as a vehicle for an antibody-drug conjugate
(ADC) approach using the potent cytotoxin, calicheamicin.
Reasonable efficacy was seen but in this example the
overall therapeutic window was low as calicheamicin was
not well tolerated at the higher doses [22]. ADCs are a
well-established and clinically-successful approach to
cancer therapy but target and payload selection are key in
developing drugs with high efficacy and tolerability, i.e. a
high therapeutic index (TI). With the right payload, an anti
MUC1 ADC could have great potential.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an ideal modality
for application to ADC, particularly where there is some
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

degree of normal tissue expression and hence the TI is
low. PDT is already an established treatment modality
for dysplastic Barrett’s epithelium [23]. It has also shown
utility in the treatment of cancers of the prostate, lung,
pancreas, bile duct, oral cavity and skin [24, 25]. PDT
involves the administration of a photosensitizer (PS)
and its activation locally using light to cause cellular
destruction via intracellular free radicals and/or reactive
oxygen species [26–29]. As there is little effect on
connective tissue, it preserves luminal integrity when
used in the digestive tract [29]. Though not inherent to
PDT itself, the first generation photosensitizers approved
for clinical use such as porfimer sodium suffered from
suboptimal pharmacokinetic / biodistribution profile and
poor tumor selectivity. This led to low potency and off
target photosensitivity, resulting in severe sunburn and the
scarring of internal organs in some patients [23]. These
limitations can be inherent to any therapeutic molecule
but by chemical modification and/or combination with
other molecules it is now possible to avoid them [30–
34]. Photoimmunotherapy is one such approach using
a niche ADC where PS are targeted with antibodies
(photoimmunoconjugates) [33, 35–38].
This study aims to highlight the role MUC1 plays
in the progression to EA. It further examines how MUC1
expression and glycosylation are altered during esophageal
malignant transformation and later locoregional invasion.
Finally proof of principle data for the mechanism and in vitro
efficacy of a MUC1 targeting ADC using PDT is shown.

RESULTS
Identification of MUC1 as a biomarker in the
development of EA
MUC1 was linked to the progression to EA using
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Within the GSEA
two groups of upper GI samples were compared; the
comparison of non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE)
to normal esophageal squamous epithelium (Sq) gave 47
pathways that were enriched in NDBE compared to Sq,
of which 28 were significant and of these 21% included
MUC1. Comparison of EA to Sq gave 49 pathways
enriched in EA compared to Sq of which 27 pathways
were significant and of these 30% included MUC1
(Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). This recurrent
appearance of MUC1 in the significant pathways suggests
involvement in the transition of normal esophageal tissue
to malignancy. Some of the most significant pathways
included both MUC1 and HER2. To see if the MUC1
gene was up regulated during cancer progression the
data was mined using the Affymetrix probe for MUC1
to retrieve raw gene expression values. When compared
to Sq, mRNA levels in NDBE show a 2.3 fold increase
in MUC1 expression (p < 0.001), while mRNA levels in
EA showed an increase in both the range of expression as

(p = 0.03) (Figure 1).

its intracellular location. Since it was shown HuHMFG1
bound some normal epithelium, development as a
photoimmunoconjugate was chosen as the use of light
to selectively activate the drug in a local area could be
used to avoid the majority of normal epithelium which
can be distinguished endoscopically.
HuHMFG1 staining at the optimized concentration
was sensitive (95% of cancers were identified as
positive) but not specific (40% of normal tissue also
stained positive). Specificity for HGD and EA could be
demonstrated by using a less antibody (0% staining in
Sq, NDBE and LGD) however this was at the expense of
substantially reduced sensitivity (positive staining in HGD
and EA fell to ~20%) (Supplementary Figure 3).
Staining of resection specimens demonstrated
that HuHMFG1 does not bind normal connective tissue,
vascular or muscular structures of the esophagus. The
epithelial specificity of HuHMFG1 is demonstrated
exquisitely in Figure 5 in which a whole esophagus
transverse section taken from a patient with EA was
stained with HuHMFG1. This section includes 2 lymph
nodes, one infiltrated with cancer and one free of disease.
HuHMFG1 selectively stains only the infiltrated node.
To confirm this pattern in lymph nodes, staining was
extended to a panel of 11 EA resection specimens with
31 associated locoregional nodes. HuHMFG1 staining
was positive in all 18 tumor infiltrated lymph nodes
and negative in all 13 benign nodes (Fishers exact p
<0.0001). This reinforces the choice for HuHMFG1
for therapeutically application as any off target effects
in normal areas would spare connective, muscular and
vascular tissue and damaged normal squamous mucosa
can regrow [40].

MUC1 glycoprotein tissue staining
Four antibodies against different epitopes of
MUC1 (Figure 2) were used to stain patient samples
representing various stages toward progression to cancer;
Sq epithelium, NDBE, low-grade dysplasia (LGD),
high grade dysplasia (HGD) and invasive esophageal
adenocarcinoma (EA). HuHMFG1 immunostaining was
mostly membranous and cytoplasmic with additional
nuclear staining in highly expressing samples. CT2 and
NCL-MUC-1 stained predominantly the apical membrane
with mild cytoplasmic positivity. NCL-MUC-1-CORE
staining was focused on the luminal surface of cells. In
all cases binding was limited to the epithelial cell layer.
The intensity of HuHMFG1 staining increased in the
progression to EA, and towards the more differentiated
superficial epithelial cells (Figure 3).
HuHMFG1 and CT2 binding increased from
moderate in squamous mucosa to high levels in NDBE.
NCL-MUC-1 and NCL-MUC-1-CORE maintained
low binding levels in normal and dysplastic tissue but
increased to high levels of binding in EA tissue (Figure
4). An alternative representation (Supplementary
Figure 2) shows the Allred score of individual samples
and is presented to show the heterogeneity of all four
antibodies across all pathological grades. Due to the
recognized EA risk of dysplastic columnar epithelium,
and a desire to target it therapeutically [4, 39],
HuHMFG1 was selected as the optimum antibody to
take forward for therapeutic development over CT2 as
the latter is not as suitable for ADC development due to

HuHMFG1 potential as a therapeutic antibody
in living cells

localization of HuHMFG1 was demonstrated in a breast
cancer cell line [21].
To prove the targetable therapeutic potential of
HuHMFG1, an ADC of the antibody was made via NHS
ester mediated amide conjugation of photosensitive drug
molecules (PS1) to available lysine amino acids [41, 42].
UV-VIS spectrometry of the final HuHMFG1:PS1 ADC
dissolved in PBS confirmed peak absorption at 683nm for
laser activation and approximately 7 PS1 photosensitizers
were coupled on average onto each HuHMFG1 antibody
(Figure 7). Digital image analysis of reducing SDS-PAGE
separation of the conjugate indicated 52% of the PS1 was
conjugated to HuHMFG1 via a covalent amide bond,
and 48% was conjugated via non-covalent interactions.
The non-covalent material in the conjugate was tightly
bound and not dissociated in biological buffers or with
the addition of low level detergent during the purification
process. Upon conjugation small shifts in the absorbance
spectra of PS1 were observed; the two main PS1 peaks at
398nm and 687nm shifted 4-5nm into the blue, and the

To confirm binding to native antigen in living cells,
HuHMFG1 was tested in vitro on a panel of esophageal
cell lines derived from each stage in the squamousmetaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. All EA lines
showed a dose dependent increase in cell binding of
HuHMFG1 to a point of cell surface receptor saturation;
HuHMFG1 binding was at a low level in normal
squamous cells (Het1A) but then incrementally increased
through NDBE cells (BAR-T), HGD cells (chTERT)
with the highest level of binding seen in EA cells (OE19)
(Figure 6).
For an effective ADC, it is preferable but not
required that it underwent intracellular internalization
after binding. Using confocal microscopy, internalization
of HuHMFG1 into an EA cell line (OE19) was shown
(Figure 6). The punctate intracellular pattern is similar to
the pattern seen in previous work where endosomal co-

esophageal tissue from incremental pathological grades including normal squamous epithelium (Sq), non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus
(NDBE), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high grade dysplasia (HGD) and invasive esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). Positivity was defined by
2+/3+ intensity staining in ≥10% of the pathology examined. The proportion of positive samples for each tissue is shown with respectively

ratio between the two main peaks changed from 2.2 in
the free PS1 to 2.6 in the conjugated form. There were
no shifts in absorbance observed between the free and
conjugated antibody at 280nm (Figure 7).
Confocal microscopy was used to confirm
HuHMFG1:PS1 ADC internalization into OE19 cells.
Both the drug (PS1) and antibody (HuHMFG1) parts of
the conjugate remain co-localized after internalization
in a similar pattern to that seen with unconjugated
HuHMFG1 (Figure 7). Due to the photoactive nature of
the drug, carrying out live cell imaging induces cell death.
In an attempt to co-localize the ADC with a marker of
endosomal localization, a nontoxic ADC was produced
using the same reaction conditions but in which nontoxic Cy5.5 dye molecules were covalently conjugated to

HuHMFG1 instead of PS1. Spectral analysis of the new
HuHMFG1:Cy5.5 ADC show the antibody had an average
of 5 dye molecules covalently bound per antibody and
when run on SDS PAGE, the conjugate showed 30% noncovalently bound Cy5.5 (data not shown). Results showed
partial co-localization of the HuHMFG1:Cy5.5 conjugate
with transferrin a marker of the recycling endosomal
pathway. This could suggest HuHMFG1 conjugates are
internalized during endocytosis but then delivered to
another compartment, i.e. the lysosome compartment
(Figure 7).
The phototoxic ADC HuHMFG1:PS1 was
investigated for its light dependent cytotoxicity with an
in vitro MUC1 positive EA cell line. OE19 cells were
incubated in the dark with a range of doses of either

HuHMFG1:PS1 or the equivalent concentration of free
PS1 molecules. Cells were then washed and either left
in the dark or irradiated with low intensity laser light at
670nm [0.33J/cm2 over 10seconds] (Figure 8A). Despite
the non-covalently bound material, light-dependent
cytotoxicity of the HuHMFG1:PS1 ADC was seen to
be significantly more potent than equivalent amounts
of PS1 alone (linear regression p=0.0022, F=26.09). No
significant cytotoxicity was seen with either drug in the
dark (linear regression p=0.7335, F=0.1273) or between
the vehicle control (2% DMSO) and cells in media only
(p=0.12) (data not shown). The top HuHMFG1:PS1 dose
was then used to compare cytotoxicity in MUC1 positive
OE19 cells to a MUC1 negative cell line HT29 (Figure
8B). The phototoxic efficacy of the HuHMFG1:PS1 ADC
was significantly greater in MUC1 positive OE19 cells

than negative HT29 cells (t test p<0.0006). No cytotoxicity
was seen in either line with the unconjugated antibody or
with the ADC in the absence of light.

DISCUSSION
GSEA looks at cellular pathways focusing on
groups of genes that share common biological function,
chromosomal location, or regulatory pathways. GSEA
found MUC1 was identified as a protein involved
with, and up-regulated in, the progression from normal
squamous epithelium to invasive EA. To confirm the
GSEA results, and to clarify some of the variations in
MUC1 IHC profiles previously reported in the literature,
4 different antibodies recognizing different epitopes of
MUC1 were tested in a panel of human biopsy samples.

Figure 6: MUC-1 expression in esophageal cell lines of various pathological grades and internalization into esophageal
adenocarcinoma. A. Binding of the antibody HuHMFG1 in vitro to esophageal cell lines originally isolated from tissue of various

pathological grades was carried out using flow cytometry. Cells were incubated with varying concentrations of HuHMFG1 antibody which
was detected using a FITC conjugated anti-human IgG secondary fluorescent antibody (shown in green) shown alongside nuclei staining
with DAPI (shown in blue). An increase in fluorescence represents more HuHMFG1 bound to each cell and the saturation of the fluorescent
signal indicates cell surface receptor saturation. HuHMFG1 did not bind the colonic line HT29 (negative control). It bound at a low level
in normal squamous and non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus (NDBE) and a high level in high grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal
adenocarcinoma (EA). B. Confocal microscopy images showing OE19 cells exposed to HuHMFG1 (i) or media alone (ii). OE19 internalize

The NCL-MUC-1-CORE antibody binds directly
to the VNTR protein backbone where normal mucin
glycosylation levels sterically hinder antibody binding.
Sagara and colleagues had similar findings with a

different MUC1 backbone binding antibody (DF3). They
too showed it did not bind normal squamous esophageal
epithelium [43]. Strong binding of this antibody in EA is
most likely due to a tumor associated MUC1 reduction

effective in the MUC1 positive line compared to the MUC1 negative control (Students t-test; p=0.0006). No significant cytotoxic effect was
seen in either line with the vehicle control, antibody alone or ADC without light activation.

this staining intensity will not correlate with MUC1
expression at the molecular level, this is due to variation
in the number of tandem repeats between individuals [46].
Though variation does exist, for the purpose of clinical
translation we expect MUC1 will follow the example
set by Trastuzumab in HER2 positive esophagogastric
cancer and use a similar IHC staining intensity cut-off to
identify which individuals would respond well to antibody
treatment [5].
HuHMFG1 and CT2 demonstrate persistently high
levels of binding in all pathological grades from NDBE to
EA making them suitable for ADC development for early
and locally advanced esophageal neoplasia. CT2 is an
intracellular epitope so further development was focused
on HuHMFG1. Though HuHMFG1 bound a proportion of
normal epithelium, its specificity to the epithelial layer is
important therapeutically. Damaged mucosa can re-grow
but serious damage occurs when therapy reaches deeper
muscle layers and can cause esophageal strictures [23, 47].
Re-epithelialization with neosquamous epithelium is likely
to follow HuHMFG1 treatment strategies in pre-invasive
disease, similar to regeneration seen following ablative
esophageal therapies [4]. HuHMFG1 also offers potential
to treat a selection of established invasive cancers,
including those with locoregional lymph node spread,
particularly if a photosensitizing drug is used which is
activated by deep red light. At 670nm, light penetrates
more deeply into tissue than at 633nm, used to activate
first generation PS such as porfimer sodium. Under
optimal conditions, depth of necrosis can also extend
up to five times the light penetration [48]. In bladder
tumors, 673nm light penetrates 5.03mm to create PDT
effect up to 25mm from the urothelial surface [49]. When
administered into the lumen of the esophagus, a similar
depth of PDT effect is envisaged allowing for treatment of
locally infiltrated lymph nodes.
HuHMFG1 was shown to bind a panel of living
esophageal cells throughout the pathological grades in
a similar pattern to that observed with IHC. To provide
proof-of-concept of HuHMFG1 as an ADC a conjugate
with a photoactive-drug was produced. Photodynamic
therapy (PDT) is particularly relevant for EA as laser light
is easily applied via endoscopy. Targeting photosensitizers
with HuHMFG1 would improve PDT selectivity. PS1
(previously developed as compound 1) is a second
generation photosensitizer based on the chlorophyll
derivative PPa. It has been chemically manipulated to
include a bioconjugation handle and a series of short
PEG-like chains to increase its water solubility [41]. PS1
was conjugated to HuHMFG1 via NHS mediated amide
bond formation to exposed lysine amino acid residues.
The ADC produced was shown to contain an average of 7
PS1 molecules per antibody but around half of these were
non-covalently bound. Since the method for estimating
conjugation ratio uses extinction coefficients based on the
absorbance spectra of the free PS1 dye, the small shifts
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in absorbance upon conjugation may compromise the
validity of the resulting ratio. Further work would have
to be done to address this before the ADC is taken further.
The additional non-covalently bound material is a problem
seen elsewhere with PDT-ADCs and would hinder further
development as it stands. It would likely cause batch-tobatch inconsistencies and make for poor chemical and
biological reproducibility alongside a loss of selectivity
of the final product [50]. Despite some of the PS1 being
non-covalently bound, the photosensitizer and antibody
seem to remain co-localized in vitro. The intracellular
localization of the photoimmunoconjugate is critical to
the mechanism of action and would rather be established
more fully and where possible done with the final drug,
not a non-toxic equivalent as we have shown, if this was to
be taken further. For future translation we plan to improve
purity by using smaller antibody fragments with optimized
lysine spacing and an alternative conjugation strategy
with more hydrophilic PS. This would have advantages
from a pharmacokinetic and manufacturing point of view
[33]. We have successfully applied this technique using a
HER2 targeting antibody Fab fragment [51]. We believe
despite these issues with purity, the cytotoxicity results
presented offer a promising proof of concept for a MUC
targeted ADC. A low dose of laser light, only 0.33J/cm2,
was used to make it translatable to the lower level of light
that can be clinically delivered deeper into tissue. The
wavelength of light used was 670nm and so use of a laser
closer matched to the peak absorbance of PS1 (Figure 7)
would hopefully improve cytotoxicity. HuHMFG1:PS1
demonstrated light dependent cytotoxicity that was
significantly more effective for both the MUC1 positive
cell line than for the MUC1 negative cell line and more
potent than equivalent free PS1 photosensitizer.
This paper confirms how MUC1 is upregulated
during progression with gene set enrichment analysis,
immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry in esophageal
tissues and cell lines taken from discrete histological
grades. It clarifies previously conflicting data with regards
to the detection of epitopes differentially expressed on
MUC1 due to glycosylation changes. It shows how MUC1
expression is maintained by glandular cells throughout
the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence, binding
only the epithelial layer in early disease. In advanced
disease, expression is maintained by glandular cells as
they invade the submucosa, muscular layer and into
metastases. HuHMFG1 was shown to positively bind a
high proportion of cases from non-dysplastic Barrett’s
epithelium, through degrees of dysplasia to invasive EA.
This suggests HuHMFG1 may have excellent therapeutic
potential. To confirm this, we showed HuHMFG1 binding
in live cells and developed first in class proof-of-concept
MUC1 targeting photoactive ADCs. We postulated on
its therapeutic mechanism and confirmed its cytotoxic
efficacy for the future translation of this antibody into the
clinical arena.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

in the absence of background staining with antibodies
at the following primary concentrations. NCL-MUC-1
(1:500; Leica-Novocastra), HuHMFG1 (1:1000 [10μg/
mL]; Antisoma, UK) NCL-MUC-1-CORE (1:500; LeicaNovocastra) and CT2 (1:500; gifted by Professor Sandra
Gendler, Mayo Clinic, USA). Staining was carried out
using heat-induced epitope retrieval in pH 6.0 sodium
citrate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, S4641). Endogenous
peroxidase (Leica, RE7157) and non-specific protein
activity (Leica, RE7158) were blocked prior incubation
with primary antibody. The humanized antibody
HuHMFG1 required initial biotinylation (ThermoFisher,
21335) followed by incubation with ExtrAvidin
Peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich E2886). All other slides were
incubated with post-primary block (Leica RE7159) and
polymer (Leica RE7161). Slides were then developed with
3,3-diaminobenzadine tetrahydrochloride as a chromogen
(Leica RE7162), counterstained with hematoxylin,
dehydrated in graded ethanol and mounted in distyrene
plasticizer xylene (Sigma Aldrich 06522).
All slides were scored by two expert GI pathologists
(MN, MRJ). Positive MUC1 cases were defined as
those staining 2+/3+ intensity in ≥10% of the pathology
examined, following the established classification
adopted for HER2 [5]. The Allred system was also
used to characterize staining in more detail. Intensity
was scored as negative (0), mild (1), moderate (2+) and
strong (3+), and proportion of tissues positively stained
as negative (0), <1% (1), 1-<10% (2), 10-<33% (3), 33<66% (4) and ≥66% (5) [62]. Statistical tests including chi
squared, Pearson's R and Linear regression analysis were
performed using IBM® SPSS® statistics Version 22 (IBM
Corporation).

Gene set enrichment analysis
Microarray data was obtained from Gene Expression
Omnibus data from Wang et al [52]. The data set included
19 normal esophageal squamous epithelium, 20 NDBE
and 21 EA samples. Gene set enrichment analysis was
carried out as previously described on around 4000
cellular pathways using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test
[53]. Recurrent genes in the most important pathways in
transition from squamous to NDBE and squamous to EA
were identified. The MUC1 gene probe 213693_s_at was
then used to mine additional gene expression microarray
data [52, 54–56] for raw mRNA expression levels using
Affymetrix, and compared with Mann-Whitney test.

Tissue panel
A panel of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)
esophageal specimens of varying pathological grades was
identified from the University College London Hospital
upper gastrointestinal clinical database. The pathology
sample chosen was of the highest grade the patient had at
the time of sampling. Ethical approval was obtained from
the UK Research Ethics Committee (EC13.13; 08/H808/8;
08/H0714/27). Esophageal tissue samples were selected
from 123 patients containing, in order of disease severity;
normal squamous tissue (n=15), NDBE (n=29), low
grade dysplasia (n=25;), high grade dysplasia (n=34) and
invasive EA (n=20). Sections from selected samples were
stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) to confirm the
reported pathological grade by two expert GI pathologists
(MN, MRJ). H&E staining was performed using standard
protocols.

Cell culture

Immunohistochemistry

Het1A obtained from ATCC (October 2014) is
a human cell line established from an area of normal
esophageal epithelium that has been SV40 large T
antigen-immortalised [63, 64]. BAR-T gifted by Prof
Rhonda Souza (UT Southwestern, USA) is a human
cell line established from an area of non-neoplastic
Barrett’s that has been telomerase-immortalised [65].
ChTERT (CP-52731) gifted by Dr Stuart McDonald
(Barts Cancer Institute, UK) is a human epithelial cell line
established from an area of high grade dysplastic Barrett’s
esophagus that has also been telomerase-immortalised
[66]. OE19, obtained from the ECACC (May 2014) is a
human epithelial cell line established from a stage three
moderately differentiated esophageal adenocarcinoma
at the esophageal gastric junction [67]. These cells were
compared to human Caucasian colon adenocarcinoma cell
line (HT-29) gifted by Prof Marilena Louzidou (Royal
Free Hospital, UK) as a negative control, as it does not
bind HuHMFG1. All lines were cultured either according
to ECACC/ATCC guidelines or their original publication.
All cells were confirmed mycoplasma free.

In order to examine MUC1 glycoprotein expression
during progression to EA, four antibodies against
distinct areas and/or glycoforms were tested. The mouse
monoclonal antibody NCL-MUC1 binds a sialylated
amino acid attached to a carbohydrate linked to the
PDTRPAP region of the VNTR [57]. The humanized
monoclonal antibody HuHMFG1 binds a glycan linked
PDTR amino acid sequence on the VNTR [58]. The mouse
monoclonal antibody NCL-MUC-1-CORE binds directly
to the TRPAPG amino acid sequence on the VNTR
[57]. The hamster monoclonal antibody CT2 targets
the intracellular SSLSYTNPAVAATSANL amino acid
sequence on the cytoplasmic tail of MUC1 [59] Binding
of antibodies to the antigens near or on the VNTR can be
sterically hindered in fully glycosylated normal MUC1,
but become increasingly exposed in cancer due to aberrant
glycosylation [60] [61] (Figure 1).
Immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques were
optimized to maintain strongly positive tissue staining

Flow cytometry

Production and characterization of
HuHMFG1:PS1

Cell lines were detached with Accutase (Millipore
SCR005) or a 0.05%Trypsin/0.02% EDTA/0.5%PVP
solution for Het1A cells. Approx. 200,000 cells per
sample were washed and incubated in 50ul on ice
with varying concentrations of HuHMFG1. After 1
hour cells were again washed and exposed to 300nM
α-Human IgG (FAB specific) FITC conjugate (SigmaAldrich F5512) on ice for 30 minutes before two final
washes. All steps carried out in FC buffer; PBS + 2%
FCS + 1mM EDTA. Flow cytometry was carried out on
a Beckman-Coulter Cyan ADP, Cells underwent laser
excitation at 488nm and emission was recorded between
510nm and 550nm.

N-Hydroxysuccinimide activated PS1 (PS1NHS) was produced as previously published [41] and
patented [42]. Small volume aliquots of PS1-NHS or a
commercially available Cy5.5 NHS Ester (Amersham,
GE Healthcare) were dissolved in DMSO were added
progressively into a light protected PBS pH7.4 mixture
containing 16.7μM HuHMFG1 and organic solvents
at a final concentration of 20% DMSO and 6% MeCN,
PS1-NHS or Cy5.5-NHS was added until 16 times molar
excess over the protein. The reaction was left shaking
and protected from light at room temperature for 2 hours.
The resulting conjugates were dialyzed extensively into
PBS pH 7.4 through a cellulose membrane with pore size
MWCO 7kDa (Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassettes, 66370,
Pierce), to remove unreacted or hydrolyzed PS1 as well
as any organic solvents, neither gentle dialysis with a
larger MWCO or size exclusion chromatography in the
presence of low detergent concentrations were sufficient
to improve the purity. For UV-VIS analyses a sample was
diluted to a suitable concentration into PBS in a micro
volume 1 cm path length quartz cuvette and absorbance
was measured over 190-400nm on an Agilent 8453 UV
Visible Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies).
Spectra were normalized to 900 nm and PBS background
removed. Concentrations were calculated using the
following equation A = εlc where A is absorbance of
the sample, ε = molar absorptivity, l = path length in cm
and c = concentration in molar. Before spectra could be
used to calculate conjugation efficiency, Molar extinction
coefficient (M−1 cm−1) and the peak absorption were
calculated for the free dyes in PBS and used as follows
PS1 (A280=8896, A687=20594) and Cy5,5 (A280=22479,
A674=215826), a generic IgG molar extinction coefficient
was used for HuHMFG1 (A280=210000). To calculate
conjugation ratio; absorbance of the conjugate at its peak
absorbance in the red (678nm or 674nm) was used to
obtain the concentration of the dye in the conjugate, this
concentration could be used to calculate the contribution
of the dye to absorption at 280nm. The remaining A280
is then attributed to the antibody and can be used to
calculate the protein concentration. For reducing SDS
analysis a sample of the conjugate was then denatured in
reducing Laemmli Loading buffer that does not contain a
loading dye, and run through on 12% Acrylamide SDSPAGE. Fluorescence of the wet gels was visualized by
exciting the photosensitizers with a UV-transilluminator
(Fujifilm-LAS3000). Gels were then stained with
Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize protein. Image
analysis techniques of the unstained gel images were used
to estimate the proportion of covalently coupled to free
photosensitizer in the immunoconjugate mixture using
AIDA image Analyzer software v3.52.

Confocal microscopy
OE19 cells were plated in a Lab-Tek 8 well
chambered borosilicate cover glass (NUNC 155411)
at 10,000 cells/well and cultured at 37°C / 5%CO2.
Figure 6= Cells were cultured for 4hrs in media with
and without 0.5μM HuHMFG1. Figure 7C= Cells
were cultured for 2.5hrs in media with either 0.5μM
HuHMFG1:PS1 in the ADC conjugated form or 0.5μM
unconjugated HuHMFG1 plus the equivalent amount of
free PS1 that was present in the ADC. Figure 7D= Cells
were cultured for 5hrs with 0.3μM HuHMFG1:Cy5.5
with or without additional 0.3uM Transferrin Alexa
Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies).
Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde (VWR
361387P) in PBS, permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100
(Sigma-Aldrich X100) and blocked with 0.05% Triton
X-100, 4% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich G6767) and 1%
bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich 9418) in PBS.
HuHMFG1 was labelled with 0.098 mg/ml of anti-human
IgG FITC (Sigma F5512), 0.05% Triton X-100 and 4%
goat serum. Cells were then washed and co-stained
with 300nM 4',6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dilactate
(DAPI) (Invitrogen D3571) in a mounting media
made up from 0.5% N-Propyl gallate (Sigma-Aldrich
P3130), 50% glycerol (VWR 24388.295) in 20mM Tris
(Sigma-Aldrich T1503) pH 8. Images were collected
at x63 magnification on a Perkin Elmer Spinning Disk
Microscopy system using Volocity image acquisition
software. FITC or Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence was
collected with excitation at 488nm and detection
between 500 and 555nm and is shown in green. DAPI
fluorescence was collected with excitation at 405nm and
detection between 580 and 650nm and is shown in blue.
PS1 or Cy5.5 fluorescence was collected with excitation
at 640 nm and detection between 485-705 nm and is
shown in red. Single stain control wells were included in
the experiments and no bleed through was seen for any
of the dyes/channels (data not shown).

Cytotoxicity studies

Author contributions

The cytotoxic efficacy of the HuHMFG1-PS1 ADC
was compared with both equivalent concentrations of free
HuHMFG1, and free equivalent PS1 in the presence or
absence of laser “light” activation. MUC1 positive OE19
cells and MUC1 negative HT29 cells were plated in black
walled 96 well plates and allowed to adhere over 24 hours.
Cells were incubated at 37°C / 5% CO2 in the dark with
various doses of HuHMFG1, PS1 or HuHMFG1:PS1
ADC in supplemented cell culture media without phenol
red (Sigma-Aldrich R7509) plus 2% DMSO. Controls
included triton X 100 (100% cell death), culture media
with 2% DMSO (vehicle control) and media alone with
and without cells. After 2 hours cells were washed and
returned to normal media and left at 37°C / 5% CO2 for
a further hour. Where cells were irradiated laser light
was delivered at 670nm [0.33J/cm2 over 10seconds]
(HPD 7401 laser system, High Power Devices Inc). Dark
controls were not lasered. Cell viability was measured
48 hours later with MTS assay (Promega Cell Titre-96)
via absorbance at 490nm. Background absorbance was
removed using cells that had been lysed using triton X 100
and % cell viability was calculated using the cells in media
only. Cytotoxicity between cell types was compared using
the Students T-Test (Microsoft Excel). Dose response
curves comparing cytotoxicity of HuHMFG1:PS1 ADC
versus equivalent PS1 alone in light and dark were
compared using linear regression analysis assigning best
fit curves on a log scale (GraphPad PRISM ®).
