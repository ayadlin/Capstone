ABSTRACT
Metabolic plasticity is an emerging hallmark of cancer, and increased glycolysis
is often observed in transformed cells. Small molecule inhibitors that target driver
oncogenes can potentially inhibit the glycolytic pathway. Osimertinib (AZD9291) is a
novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is potent and selective for sensitising
(EGFRm) and T790M resistance mutations. Clinical studies have shown osimertinib to be
efficacious in patients with EGFRm/ T790M advanced NSCLC who have progressed after
EGFR-TKI treatment. However experience with targeted therapies suggests that acquired
resistance may emerge. Thus there is a need to characterize resistance mechanisms and
to devise ways to prevent, delay or overcome osimertinib resistance. We show here that
osimertinib suppresses glycolysis in parental EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma lines,
but has not in osimertinib-resistant cell lines. Critically, we show osimertinib treatment
induces a strict dependence on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos),
as OxPhos inhibitors significantly delay the long-term development of osimertinib
resistance in osimertinib-sensitive lines. Accordingly, growth conditions which promote
a less glycolytic phenotype confer a degree of osimertinib resistance. Our data support
a model in which the combination of osimertinib and OxPhos inhibitors can delay or
prevent resistance in osimertinib-naïve tumour cells, and represents a novel strategy
that warrants further pre-clinical investigation.

INTRODUCTION

target both T790M and activating-mutant forms of EGFR
while showing lower potency against wildtype EGFR
[7, 8]. Data from clinical trials have shown osimertinib
to have a 66% response rate against NSCLC tumours
that have become resistant to TKI treatment due to the
T790M mutation [9], and has been approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration and the European
Commission for use in T790M-positive NSCLC patients
who have progressed on EGFR TKI therapy. However it
is anticipated that osimertinib resistance will arise after
initial response. Emerging clinical data on osimertinib
resistance has shown that a subset of patients acquire
yet another EGFR mutation, C797S which also prevents
drug binding [10], or can use bypass signaling [11].
However a majority of patients likely develop resistance
by as yet unknown mechanisms, highlighting the need to
develop alternative strategies to prevent progression after
osimertinib treatment.

Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) have been reported in up to 15% and
40% of cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
in Western and Asian populations, respectively [1]. This
has prompted development of specific EGFR small
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib and
erlotinib that have shown significant clinical benefit in this
segment. Unfortunately in a large majority of patients the
response to TKIs is not sustained, with median relapse
occurring 9–14 months after initiation of treatment [2, 3].
In approximately 60% of patients, resistance to these firstgeneration TKIs is due to a secondary T790M mutation
in EGFR within the kinase domain which prevents drug
binding [4–6]. Therefore strategies to target T790M
EGFR were developed, and osimertinib (AZD9291;
TAGRISSO™) was developed as a new class of TKI to

An emerging hallmark of cancer cells is altered
metabolism, to adapt to the increased energy and biomass
requirements that accompany transformation [12].
Notably, most cancer types exhibit enhanced glycolysis,
a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect [13].
However rather than simply a mechanism to generate
additional energy via ATP production, it is now thought
that increased glycolysis in cancer cells is required to
derive critical cellular components such as amino acids,
nucleotides and lipids from glycolytic intermediates.
Efficient ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation
(OxPhos) is also critical for cancer cells, and compounds
which target this key process are being explored as cancer
therapeutics [14]. Interestingly, the antidiabetic biguanide
drug metformin, which is a mild inhibitor of complex I of
the electron transport chain (ETC) [15], and thus OxPhos,
has significant anticancer properties [16, 17]. However it
is unclear whether these beneficial effects of metformin
in cancer patients are tumour cell autonomous, or are
rather the systemic effects of mitigating the deleterious
symptoms of metabolic syndrome [18]. Nevertheless,
clinical trials testing the efficacy of metformin in a wide
range of cancers have been undertaken [14]. OxPhos
inhibitors with increased potency and cellular uptake, such
as the discontinued biguanide drug phenformin, are also
being tested in preclinical cancer models [19, 20].
Dominantly-acting oncogenes have been shown
to drive increased glycolysis in tumour cells [21, 22]. In
this study, we hypothesized that osimertinib could inhibit
glycolysis in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma lines.
Moreover, we wished to test whether osimertinib resistance
led to an altered metabolic phenotype, and critically,
whether OxPhos inhibition could inhibit the development
of osimertinib resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer lines.

glycolysis inhibition and both average osimertinib IC50 and
suppression of S6 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure
S1B, S1C and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly,
NCI-H1975 cell lines with acquired osimertinib resistance
[24] cultured in the absence of osimertinib showed no
change in glycolysis after subsequent osimertinib treatment
(Figure 1E), despite potent EGFR inhibition (Figure 1F).
Similar results were obtained in osimertinib-resistant
derivatives of PC9 cells, where osimertinib treatment
either has no (PC9-AZDR1 and PC9-AZDR2) or little
(PC9-AZDR4) effect on lactate secretion (Supplementary
Figure S1D). We confirmed that osimertinib’s effects on
lactate were due to impairment of glycolysis by measuring
hexokinase activity – the first enzymatic step in glycolysis
- on similarly treated cells. We saw that osimertinib
sensitive cells showed reduced hexokinase activity after
drug treatment, whereas NCI-H1975 cells with acquired
osimertinib resistance did not alter hexokinase activity in
response to EGFR inhibition (Figure 1G) Taken together
these data suggest that osimertinib-resistant cells rely on
an alternative pathway for glycolysis in the absence of
EGFR. However cells with T790M-mediated acquired
resistance to gefitinib (PC9-IR4) or vandetinib (PC9VanR) showed attenuated lactate secretion after osimertinib
treatment (Supplementary Figure S1E), aligned with
their growth sensitivity to this drug (Supplementary
Figure S1F). Moreover, PC9-VanR cells showed
reduced hexokinase activity after osimertinib treatment
(Figure 1G). Gene expression analysis of osimertinibsensitive PC9 cells showed that several key regulators
of glycolysis were downregulated after osimertinib
(Figure 1H). Downregulation glycolytic genes was
confirmed at the mRNA level in a panel of osimertinibsensitive lines, particularly evident in HCC827 and PC9VanR cells, whereas osimertinib-resistant NCI-H1975
cells showed no significant downregulation of this set of
mRNAs (Supplementary Figure S1G). Moreover, 24h
osimertinib treatment of PC9, PC9-VanR and NCI-H1975
cells caused a significant increase in mRNA expression
of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), a negative
regulator of glycolysis [25] (Supplementary Figure S1H
and S1G), which was confirmed at the protein level in 3 of
4 osimertinib-sensitive cell lines, but not in resistant cells
(Supplementary Figure S1H). Therefore we conclude that
inhibition of glycolysis correlates with growth inhibition
by osimertinib, and that glycolysis in cells with acquired
osimertinib resistance is EGFR-independent.
Because osimertinib effectively inhibits glycolysis
in sensitive lines, we hypothesized that OxPhos inhibitors
might synergize with osimertinib to block the growth of
EGFR-mutant lines. We compared osimertinib growth
response curves with and without the addition of 0.1 mM
phenformin (approximate IC50). Phenformin had no effect
on the acute osimertinib sensitivity of PC9 and HCC827
cell lines (Supplementary Figure S2A, S2B), whereas
phenformin caused a modest increase in the osimertinib

RESULTS
Previous reports have shown that suppression of
dominantly-acting kinase oncogenes via specific small
molecule inhibitors can attenuate glycolysis [21, 22]. We
wished to evaluate the effects of osimertinib on glycolytic
metabolism in EGFRm lung cancer cell lines. As seen in
Figure 1A, osimertinib impairs lactate production – a marker
of glycolysis - in the EGFR-mutant lines NCI-H1975
and PC9, while having no effect on lactate in the EGFRwildtype line NCI-H460. This effect is EGFR-specific,
because gefitinib inhibits glycolysis in PC9 cells, but not
in gefitinib-resistant T790M+ NCI-H1975 cells which
retain EGFR activity (Figure 1B). Osimertinib inhibited
lactate secretion in an expanded set of EGFRm lines, with
the exception of NCI-H1650 cells (Figure 1C), which
are intrinsically resistant to EGFR inhibitors including
osimertinib (reference [23] and Supplementary Figure S1A),
and only modestly suppress S6 phosphorylation in response
to osimertinib despite EGFR suppression (Figure 1D).
Overall there was a significant inverse correlation between

sensitivity of NCI-H1975 cells (Figure 2A). Conversely,
the sensitivity of NCI-H1975 cells to a range of OxPhos
inhibitors including phenformin (Figure 2B), metformin
(Figure S2C), the biguanide buformin (Supplementary
Figure S2D) and BAY 87-2243 - a small molecule with
potent OxPhos inhibitory properties [26] - (Supplementary
Figure S2E) was enhanced by the addition of osimertinib.
Further evidence co-suppression of glycolysis and OxPhos

can impair growth of EGFRm cells was provided by
the fact that oligomycin, an ATP synthase inhibitor that
blocks OxPhos, sensitizes NCI-H1975 cells to 2-DG,
a glucose analogue that blocks the glycolytic pathway
(Supplementary Figure S2F). Because osimertinib fails
to suppress glycolysis in resistant cells, we hypothesized
that they would show no increased sensitivity to OxPhos
inhibition compared to sensitive lines, and indeed there is

no significant increase in sensitivity to phenformin (Figure 2C,
Supplementary S2G), metformin (Supplementary Figure S2H)
or BAY-87-2243 (Supplementary Figure S2I). Furthermore,
phenformin co-treatment had no effect on osimertinib
sensitivity of resistant cells (Figure 2E). When NCI-H1975,
PC9 and HCC827 cells were treated with osimertinib or
phenformin alone or in combination (Figure 2F, S2J),
osimertinib effectively inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
which was not altered by the addition of phenformin. However,
ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation was more strongly
inhibited by osimertinib/phenformin treatment than treatment
with either drug alone. We next hypothesized that concurrent
inhibition of glycolysis and OxPhos metabolism might induce
apoptosis in EGFRm cells. The osimertinib/phenformin
combination significantly increased caspase 3/7 activation in a
subset of cell lines (NCI-H820, HCC827, HCC2935 and PC9VanR) over osimertinib alone (Figure 2G, Supplementary Figure
S2K), and we observed a similar pattern when a subset of these
cell lines were subjected to Annexin V staining after compound
treatment (Supplementary Figure S2L). We observed a similar
proportion of lines that showed increased caspase activity upon
addition of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886), as previously described [23], though these two sets of
cell lines did not completely overlap.
Although we saw an increased sensitivity to
osimertinib in NCI-H1975 cells with concurrent
phenformin treatment in a short-term growth assay, we
wished to assess the effect of OxPhos inhibitors on the
acquisition of osimertinib resistance in a model that better
represents clinical progression. We employed a long-term
culture system where cells were plated at low density in
multiple wells and cultured for a prolonged period [23].
In this assay, all osimertinib-treated NCI-H1975 wells
achieved resistance by day 25 post-plating (Figure 3A),
whereas more sensitive cell lines had both a lower
proportion of resistant wells and a longer median time to
resistance (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure S3A–S3C).
Nevertheless, for all cell lines tested, phenformin delayed
or prevented the development of osimertinib resistance in a
dose dependent manner. For example, in PC9 cells only 10%
of wells (3/30) became resistant when 30 nM osimertinib
was combined with 30 µM phenformin compared to 97% of
wells (29/30) with osimertinib monotherapy (Supplementary
Figure S3A). At 160 nM osimertinib (Figure 3B), 60% of
wells (18/30) reached confluence, which was reduced to
17% (5/30) with the addition of phenformin. Similarly,
in NCI-H1975 cells 100 μM phenformin, a dose that had
negligible effects as monotherapy, blocked resistance
to both osimertinib (Figure 3A) and CO-1686, another
T790M-targeting EGFR inhibitor [27]; Supplementary
Figure S3D). In contrast, in NCI-H1650 cells, which show
EGFR-independent glycolysis (Figure 1C), phenformin
had only modest effects when combined with osimertinib
(Supplementary Figure S3E), supporting the hypothesis
that simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis and OxPhos
mediates attenuation of resistance. Further, combining
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

osimertinib and a panel of OxPhos inhibitors (metformin,
buformin, BAY 87-2243 and oligomycin) in NCI-H1975
cells showed a dramatic suppression or elimination of
resistance, aside from metformin which had only modest
effects commensurate with its previously described lower
potency in transformed cells [28] (Figure 3C). Finally,
we established that the effects of OxPhos inhibition on
resistance were AMPK-independent, as the direct AMPK
activators compound 991 [29] and 5-Aminoimidazole-4carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) were unable to alter
the kinetics of osimertinib resistance (Figure 3D).
Previous reports have shown that a significant
subset of osimertinib-resistant cell lines show markedly
enhanced sensitivity to MEK inhibition [23, 24]. However
we predict that resistance will develop after initial MEK
inhibitor sensitivity. To model this phenomenon in vitro,
selumetinib-sensitive PC9-AZDR1 and NCI-H1975AZDR1 cells were plated in long-term culture assays as
described above (Figure 4A, 4B). After initial sensitivity
to MEK inhibition by selumetinib, 93% and 100% of
PC9-AZDR1 wells demonstrated resistance (Osi/Sel
treatment). In contrast, co-treatment of PC9-AZDR1 cells
with osimertinib, selumetinib and 3 or 10 μM phenformin
(Osi/Sel/Phen treatment) resulted in only 27% (8/30)
or 13% (4/30) of resistant wells, respectively. Similar
results were seen for a separate osimertinib-resistant,
MEKi-sensitive line (PC9-AZDR4 cells; Supplementary
Figure S4A). Moreover, while phenformin did not alter
the proportion of wells demonstrating resistance to Osi/
Sel treatment in NCI-H1975-AZDR1 cells, it significantly
delayed the median onset of time to resistance from 18
days to 28.5 days (30 µM phenformin) or 31.5 days (100
µM phenformin). Importantly, PC9-AZDR2 and NCIH1975-AZDR4 cells, which show no enhanced MEK
inhibitor sensitivity in short-term assays [24] showed only
moderate sensitivity to the Osi/Sel combination and the
addition of phenformin has minimal effects on resistance
(Supplementary Figure S4B, S4C). PC9-AZDR1,
PC9-AZDR4, NCI-H1975-AZDR1 and NCI-H1975AZDR4 cells treated with the Osi/Sel/Phen combination
showed an enhanced inhibition of S6 phosphorylation
compared to Osi/Sel or Osi/Phen treatment (Figure
4C, Supplementary Figure S4C). Furthermore, the
addition of phenformin potentiated the apoptotic effect
of Osi/Sel in PC9-AZDR1 cells, while the effects in
PC9-AZDR2 cells were minimal (Figure 4D). NCIH1975-AZDR1 cells showed minimal apoptosis after
Osi/Sel treatment similar to the parental cell line
(Figure 2E) that could not be enhanced by phenformin
(data not shown). Our model predicts that the ability
of phenformin to suppress Osi/Sel resistance in PC9AZDR1, PC9-AZDR4 and NCI-H1975-AZDR1 cells is
due to its OxPhos inhibitory effects. We see that while
osimertinib alone had no effect on lactate production in
PC9-AZDR1, PC9-AZDR4 and NCI-H1975-AZDR1
cells, Osi/Sel effectively inhibits glycolysis in these cells
86317

(Figures 4E, S4D), whereas this combined inhibition
of EGFR and MEK has a limited effect on insensitive
PC9-AZDR2 and NCI-H1975-AZDR4 cells.Taken together
these data support the idea that simultaneous suppression
of glycolysis and OxPhos underlies the cooperative effects
of phenformin and small molecule kinase inhibitors.
We hypothesize here that inhibition of OxPhos
suppresses the development of osimertinib resistance in
EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines. We next tested whether
cells with enhanced OxPhos activity showed increased
osimertinib resistance. OxPhos can be upregulated by
altering the main fuel source in cells from glucose to
lactose or galactose, which forces cells to generate ATP
via mitochondrial respiration. As expected, NCI-H1975
cells plated in galactose showed enhanced sensitivity to
phenformin (Supplementary Figure S5A), but interestingly
were significantly less sensitive to osimertinib (Figure 5A).
Similarly, HCC827 cells showed marked osimertinib
resistance when grown in galactose media (Figure 5B),
while PC9 cells showed reduced osimertinib sensitivity
in lactate-containing media (Supplementary Figure S5B).
OxPhos can also be enhanced by serine deprivation, as cells
divert the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate into
the de novo serine synthesis pathway. In serine/glycinedepleted conditions (SFM), 3 of 4 cell lines showed marked
osimertinib resistance (Figure 5C, 5D and Supplementary
S5C, S5D). To explore this phenomenon further, we
generated “serine-deprived” (SD) derivatives of PC9 cells

by prolonged culture (> 21 days) in SFM (Supplementary
Figure S5E). These cells showed reduced glycolysis which
persisted when serine was added back to culture (Figure
5E). Moreover, they showed enhanced sensitivity to
phenformin when grown in full RPMI media (Figure 5F).
While no enhanced osimertinib resistance was observed in
PC9-SD cells in short-term growth assays (Supplementary
Figure S5F), they displayed significantly less osimertinibinduced apoptosis (Figure 5G). Critically, when these cells
were plated in long-term resistance assays, PC9-SD cells
showed significantly earlier onset of resistance (Figure 5H).
Interestingly, PC9-SD cells maintain a higher degree of S6
phosphorylation after osimertinib treatment compared to
parental cells (Figure 5I). Thus when EGFR-mutant cells
derive their ATP via OxPhos rather than glycolysis they
show decreased osimertinib sensitivity, and increased
sensitivity to OxPhos inhibitors.

DISCUSSION
Osimertinib provides an effective treatment option
for NSCLC patients with EGFRm-positive tumours
that have relapsed while on EGFR TKI therapy due
to T790M. Moreover, osimertinib has been recently
tested in the first-line setting for EGFRm patients – a
majority of which were T790M-negative – and was
found to have a promising median progression-free
survival of 19.3 months [30]. However, osimertinib and

other TKI monotherapies are not curative, so additional
therapeutic strategies must be identified to prolong
patient benefit. Potential diverse clinical molecular
mechanisms of EGFR TKI resistance are increasingly
becoming identified. For instance, T790M [1], MET [31]
or HER2 [32] amplification and PIK3CA mutation [5]
have been associated with resistance to early generation
TKIs. Similarly, clinical resistance mechanisms to
osimertinib include EGFR-C797S mutation [10] or

bypass signalling through MET or HER2 [33]. This
provides a challenge of identifying molecular resistance
segments that would respond to novel targeted
combinations. However, from the data presented here,
we hypothesize that by subjecting tumour cells to
apoptotic or metabolic stress through dual blockade of
glycolysis and OxPhos, the pool of actively dividing
cells with the potential to develop such resistance
mechanisms would be significantly reduced. Moreover,

since our data demonstrates that such a strategy can be
effective across different cell backgrounds and resistance
mechanisms, this approach could provide a more generic
strategy to combat resistance in heterogeneous tumours.
Interestingly, after we generated osimertinib-resistant
cell lines in vitro, we found them to be equally sensitive
to OxPhos inhibitors as their parental counterparts, even
when osimertinib is present. This finding is critical for
devising a potential therapeutic strategy, suggesting
that maximal patient benefit would occur with the
osimertinib/OxPhos inhibitor combination given up
front in osimertinib-sensitive tumours, whereas such a

combination would provide little benefit once resistance
was established in a tumour population.
We [24] and others [23] have previously shown that
combining EGFR and MEK inhibitors can significantly
impair resistance to EGFR inhibition in EGFRm positive
NSCLC cell lines Moreover, we have shown that a subset
of cell lines with acquired osimertinib display enhanced
sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib [24].
However resistant cell lines that initially show sensitivity
to the osimertinib/selumetinib combination show rapid
regrowth both in vitro (Figure 4A, 4B) and in vivo (data
not shown). While mechanisms mediating this “double

resistance” are unknown, its rapid onset likely precludes
genetic alterations, whereas metabolic adaptation is one
possible explanation for the observed results. Phenformin’s
ability to inhibit osimertinib/selumetinib resistance lends
support to this hypothesis, although more careful metabolic
analysis of “double resistant” lines is warranted.
Recent interest in the anticancer potential of
metformin has exploded, however results have been largely
inconclusive with regard to clinical benefit [14]. Metformin
requires active transport into cells via the organic cation
transporter (OCT1) [34], the expression of which is
typically low or absent in transformed cells [35]. In our
current study, we saw that of OxPhos inhibitors tested,
metformin was the least proficient at inhibiting osimertinib
resistance (Figure 3C), even at supraclinical doses.
Although discontinued in the diabetes setting, phenformin
has advantages over metformin as an oncology drug; it does
not require OCT1-mediated transport into cells [35] and is
a more potent inhibitor of complex I [15]. Phenformin’s
primary adverse effect is severe lactic acidosis in a subset
of patients [36], but there is evidence that susceptibility is
genetically determined [37], and early screening to identify

vulnerable patients, combined with careful monitoring
of blood lactate could mitigate the potential for adverse
effects. Thus this drug holds promise for cancer therapy,
particularly in the settings of LKB1-null lung cancer [20]
and combination strategies such as those proposed by our
study and others [38]. However data presented here and
elsewhere [39] also points to the therapeutic potential of
small-molecule complex I inhibitors such as BAY 87-2243
that have potency in the high nanomolar range, supporting
further drug development efforts for this class of complex
I inhibitors that may have a more favourable safety profile.
The results of this study are potentially relevant not
only to EGFR-driven lung adenocarcinoma, but also to
other cancers where glycolysis is driven by dominantlyacting oncogenes. In particular, these data resemble the
metabolic adaptations in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells
treated with pathway-specific inhibitors where lactate
production is suppressed [21, 40] and mitochondrial protein
levels increased [40]. We note that a recent report showed
dramatic upregulation of mitochondrial ETC proteins after
treatment of EGFR-mutant cells with pathway inhibitors
[41]. However, we failed to detect any osimertinib-

Figure 6: Combined inhibition of glycolysis and OxPhos suppresses osimertinib resistance. (A) In osimertinib-sensitive

cells, glycolysis is EGFR-dependent. Concurrent inhibition of OxPhos induces metabolic crisis and cells are significantly less able to
develop osimertinib resistance. (B) In osimertinib-resistant cells, glycolysis is driven by EGFR-independent bypass pathways. In
combination treatment, OxPhos is inhibited yet cells can produce ATP via glycolysis. Overall OxPhos inhibitor sensitivity is similar to that
of osimertinib-sensitive cells treated with OxPhos inhibitor monotherapy.

mediated upregulation in mitochondrial ETC genes at
the mRNA (data not shown), or protein (Supplementary
Figure S1E) level. We did observe a modest increase in
basal oxygen consumption in PC9 cells pre-treated with
osimertinib (Supplementary Figure S1J), although similar
treatment in NCI-H1975 cells caused no alteration of
basal oxygen consumption (Figure S1K). Notably, the
addition of FCCP showed that the maximal respiration
rate is roughly equivalent to the basal respiration rate, even
in vehicle control cells. Similarly, osimertinib-resistant
lines maintained basal respiration at near-maximal levels,
which was not significantly altered by either osimertinib or
selumetinib treatment (Supplementary Figure S1L, S1M
and Supplementary Figure S4F, S4G). Based on our data,
we postulate that OxPhos activity is maintained at a high
level in untreated EGFRm cells, and after osimertinibinduced glycolysis suppression cells become strongly
dependent on OxPhos metabolism for energy generation.
Thus the osimertinib/phenformin combination abrogates the
metabolic “escape route” provided by OxPhos activity and
cells are effectively prevented from developing osimertinib
resistance.
Our compelling in vitro data showing inhibition of
osimertinib resistance by concurrent treatment with OxPhos
inhibitors prompts the question as to whether this can be
replicated in vivo. Unfortunately modelling osimertinib
resistance in vivo is difficult due to the potency of osimertinib
against EGFR-mutant xenografts, where under continuous
dosing no resistance is observed [8]. To circumvent this
issue, we treated animals bearing NCI-H1975 xenografts
with osimertinib alone or in combination with phenformin,
metformin or selumetinib for 28 days, and then monitored
animals for tumour regrowth (Supplementary Figure S6).
Animals treated with osimertinib alone exhibited regrowth
beginning approximately 50 days after treatment initiation.
Combining osimertinib with phenformin led to a decreased
average tumour size at day 63 over osimertinib alone that
was on the verge of statistical significance (p = 0.054; oneway ANOVA). Similar results were obtained with metformin
treatment. Notably, selumetinib in combination with
osimertinib did not improve upon the osimertinib/phenformin
combination in this model despite the osimertinib/selumetinib
combination being very effective in a transgenic model of
EGFR-driven lung cancer [24]. We conclude that this
regrowth model, which is dependent on drug cessation, is
not optimal for modelling resistance in patients, and future
work testing the osimertinib/phenformin combination in
established transgenic models will be very informative.
In summary, we have shown that the EGFR
T790M inhibitor osimertinib suppresses glycolysis, and
simultaneous treatment with OxPhos inhibitors delays or
prevents the emergence of drug resistance. Further preclinical studies, for example in genetically-defined mouse
models of EGFR T790M-driven lung adenocarcinoma,
will be key for translating this preclinical finding to a
potential therapeutic opportunity. We propose that this
could be a broadly applicable combination strategy that

enhances the benefit of osimertinib and other EGFR TKIs
in EGFRm NSCLC patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
All cell lines are listed in Supplementary Table
S2. PC9-SD cells were derived from PC9 parental cells
by growth in serine/glycine-free media (SFM) for 21
days. The identity of all cell lines was confirmed by short
tandem repeat (STR) profiling. All cells were grown in
RPMI1640 (Gibco), supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS) and 2 mM glutamine, with the exception
of the experiments where media manipulations were
carried out as follows: SFM – minimal essential medium
(MEM; Gibco Cat. ♯ 21090), 1× MEM vitamins (Gibco
Cat. ♯ 11120), 10% dialysed FCS (Hyclone) and 2 mM
glutamine; for controls serine and glycine were added
back to the above media at a concentration of 0.4 mM;
galactose/lactose-containing media – DMEM no glucose,
no glutamine (Gibco Cat. ♯ A14430-01), supplemented
with 10% dialysed FCS, 2 mM glutamine and either 5 mM
glucose (control), galactose or lactose.

Reagents and western blotting
Osimertinib, selumetinib and gefitinib were
synthesized according to published methods. Phenformin,
metformin, 2-deoxyglucose and oligomycin were purchased
from Sigma. Buformin was purchased from Santa Cruz.
BAY-87-2243 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals.
All antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table S3.
Culture medium was aspirated from cells and cells were
washed once in cold PBS. Cells were scraped into 100µl
lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 3 mM EDTA, 5
mM EGTA, 0.27 M sucrose 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM
NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 5
mM sodium pyrophosphate, Complete protease inhibitor
tablets (Roche)) per 35 mm dish. Protein concentrations
were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protocol
from Pierce and Western blots were performed by running
samples of equal protein concentration on SDS-PAGE
gels (NuPAGE™ Novex™ 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gel,
Thermo Scientific), transferring proteins to polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes, incubating with primary antibodies
overnight, followed by addition of A) fluorescent-labelled
secondary antibodies (Li-COR Biosciences) and analysis
on an Odyssey Infrared Scanner (Li-COR Biosciences) or
B) HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling)
and detected with Supersignal Pico West chemiluminescent
substrate (Thermo Scientific).

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was purified from cell lines on a
Qiacube using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit. Targeted gene

expression was performed using a 48 × 48 Fluidigm
dynamic array and ABI primers (Thermo Scientific).
50 ng of total RNA from cell lines was reverse transcribed
using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
(Thermo  Scientific) and pre-amplified with a Taqman
PreAmp master mix (Thermo Scientific) for 14 cycles with
48 selected primers. The Fluidigm Array was then primed
and loaded on an IFC Controller and qPCR experiments
run on the Biomark System. Data were collected and
analysed using the Fluidigm Real-Time PCR Analysis
software, generating Ct value. Alternatively, mRNA levels
were measured using the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit
from Qiagen in 384 well plates run on the LightCycler480
(Roche). Ct values were normalised to an average of
TFRC and GAPDH housekeeping genes and treatments
were normalized to untreated DMSO controls to calculate

to calculate p values. (*p < 0.05 two-sided paired t-test).

using the Cell Mito Stress Test protocol according to
manufacturer’s instructions, using 1 μM oligomycin,
1 μM FCCP and 0.5 μM rotenone/antimycin A.
Values were normalized to protein concentration as
measured by BCA assay after media was removed and
cells lysed directly on the plate.

Lactate assay

Long-term culture

Cell lines were plated in 12-well dishes at 50,000
cells well. The following day cells were treated in
duplicate with compounds in DMEM containing 3 mM
glucose, 2 mM glutamine and 10% dialysed FCS
(Thermo Scientific). After 24 h, conditioned media was
collected, cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation and
either frozen at −80°C or immediately subjected to an
enzymatic lactate assay (Sigma). Lactate concentrations
were calculated compared to a standard curve and values
were normalized to overall protein content of each well
(BCA assay). Values for each treatment were averaged
and normalized to DMSO control, and the experiment was
repeated for a minimum n = 3.

Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 350 cells/well
in 100 μl of media. 24 h later cells were treated with
compound in either 12 (single compound controls) or 30
wells (osimertinib alone or osimertinib + compound) as
well as a DMSO control at 2-fold the final concentration
diluted in 100 μl of media. Media was removed and
replaced with fresh media + compound (1× dose) every
7 days. Wells were followed daily over time and scored as
resistant when they had reached > 80% confluency. The
experiment continued until all wells were either confluent
or showed no evidence of growth.

Hexokinase assay

Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 4000 cells/well
in 100 μl of media. 24 h later cells were treated with
compound in triplicate at 2-fold the final concentration
diluted in 100 μl of media. 48 h after dosing plates were
analysed. For caspase assays, Caspase 3/7-Glo reagent
(Promega) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Duplicate plates were analysed for cell viability by Cell
Titer-Glo (see above) simultaneously, and caspase values
were normalized to average viability for each treatment.
Graphs represent values relative to DMSO for a minimum
n = 3. For Annexin V staining, cells were double stained
with Annexin V fluorescein conjugate/Hoescht for 15
minutes, then read using a 2-channel CellInsight NXT
plate reader (ThermoScientific). Results were calculated
as % responding cells (Annexin V positive) compared to
total number of cell nuclei (Hoescht positive).

Cell viability assays
Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 2000 cells/well
in 100 μl of media. 24 h later cells were treated in triplicate
with a 9-point half-log dosing as well as a DMSO control
at 2-fold the final concentration diluted in 100 μl of media.
96 h after dosing cells were analysed using Cell Titer-Glo
reagent (Promega) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Values were normalized to DMSO control and plotted using
GraphPad Prism. Experiments were repeated for a minimum
n = 3, and presented graphs represent a typical growth curve.

Apoptosis assays

Cell lines were plated in 12-well dishes at 50,000
cells/well. The following day cells were treated for 24 h
with indicated doses of compound at which time cells were
lysed in lysis buffer described above. Lysates were subjected
to an enzymatic hexokinase assay (Sigma) according to
manufacturer’s instructions, normalized to protein content
of each well (BCA assay). Values for each treatment were
averaged and plotted relative to DMSO control (n = 3).

Oxygen consumption analysis
PC9, PC9-AZDR1, NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1975AZDR1 cells were plated on custom Seahorse 96-well
plates at 20,000 cells/well. The following day cells were
treated with osimertinib at the indicated doses for 24 h, at
which time cells were washed 2× with unbuffered Seahorse
media (supplemented with 10 mM glucose and 1 mM
glutamine), and finally incubated with unbuffered media
containing compound for 1h at 37°C with 0% CO2. Plates
were then analysed on a Seahorse XF96e bioanalyzer
