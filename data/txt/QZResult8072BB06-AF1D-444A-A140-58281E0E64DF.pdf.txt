ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer constitutes one of the most lethal gynaecological malignancies
worldwide and currently no satisfactory therapeutic approaches have been
established. Therefore, elucidation of molecular mechanisms to develop targeted
therapy of ovarian cancer is crucial. PDLIM2 is critical to promote ubiquitination
of nuclear p65 and thus its role in inflammation has been highlighted recently. We
demonstrate that PDLIM2 is decreased in both ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma
and in various human ovarian cancer cell lines compared with normal ovary tissues
and human ovarian surface epithelial cells (HOSE). Further functional analysis
revealed that PDLIM2 is epigenetically repressed in ovarian cancer development and
inhibition of PDLIM2 promoted ovarian cancer growth both in vivo and in vitro via
NOS2-derived nitric oxide signaling, leading to recruitment of M2 type macrophages.
These results suggest that PDLIM2 might be involved in ovarian cancer pathogenesis,
which could serve as a promising therapeutic target for ovarian cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

was first proposed in the ‘incessant ovulation theory’
[3]. Rupture of the ovarian surface epithelium induces
an inflammatory reaction causing cell damage and
proliferation, enhancing potential aberrant DNA
repair, inactivating tumor-suppressor genes, leading to
subsequent mutagenesis. Chronic diseases of the female
reproductive tract (including endometriosis, polycystic
ovary syndrome and pelvic inflammatory disease) are
associated with inflammation, and are purported epithelial
invasive ovarian cancer (EOC) risk factors [4]. Recently,
both mouse and human studies suggest nuclear factorκB (NF-κB) transcription factor plays a causative role
in inflammation, and subsequently, the pathogeneses of
ovarian cancer [5]. Deregulation of NF-κB activity may

Ovarian cancer occurs in 1 of 2500 post-menopausal
females in the United States and has been considered the
most lethal gynecologic malignancy, accounting for 5–6%
of all cancer-related mortalities worldwide [1]. Patients
with advanced ovarian cancer are mainly treated with
surgical cytoreduction, followed by chemotherapy, with a
clinical response rate of 60–70%. However, many patients
ultimately succumb to relapse resistant to chemotherapy,
yielding an overall 5-year 10-30% survival rate [2].
Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel therapeutic
strategies treating advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer.

therapy for advanced ovarian cancer. Moreover, as a key
regulator of NF-κB signaling, inhibitors of IkB kinases
(IKK) were recently demonstrated to play a critical role in
both invasive and metastastic ovarian cancer processes [6].
These observations demonstrate NF-κB signaling is vital
in ovarian cancer oncogenesis and progression. NF-κB
activity is tightly regulated during physiologic conditions.
Typically, NF-κB is rapidly activated transiently in
response to different stimuli. One essential mechanism
for the swift termination of the NF-κB response involves
nuclear degradation of its prototypic member p65, a
process predominantly controlled by PDZ-LIM domaincontaining Protein 2 (PDLIM2) [7]. PDLIM2 is the most
recently discovered PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein.
The COOH-terminal LIM domain of PDLIM2 is essential
for promoting ubiquitination of nuclear p65, whereas
its NH2-terminal PDZ domain participates in shuttling
nuclear p65 along the nuclear framework into discrete
intranuclear compartments for proteasome-mediated
degradation. Accordingly, PDLIM2 knockout mice are
more sensitive to lipopolysaccharide(LPS)-induced shock
due to enhanced NF-κB/p65 activation and augmented
inflammatory cytokines production [8].
Currently, the specific molecular mechanisms
underlying ovarian cancer pathogenesis remains unclear.
Herein, we demonstrate PDLIM2 is decreased in both
ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma and in various
human ovarian cancer cell lines compared to normal
ovarian tissues and human ovarian surface epithelial cells
(HOSE). Further functional analysis revealed PDLIM2 is

epigenetically repressed in ovarian cancer development.
Inhibition of PDLIM2 promoted ovarian cancer growth
both in vivo and in vitro via NOS2-derived nitric oxide
signaling, leading to M2 type macrophages recruitment.
These results suggest an important role of PDLIM2 in
ovarian cancer pathogenesis, which might be a promising
therapeutic target in the clinical treatment of ovarian
cancer.

RESULTS
PDLIM2 expression is repressed in ovarian cancer
and is associated with patient prognosis
Given the critical role of NF-κB in ovarian
cancer pathogenesis and the involvement of PDLIM2 in
terminating NF-κB activation, we hypothesized PDLIM2
is involved in the ovarian cancer pathogenesis. We
determined PDLIM2 levels in normal ovary, fallopian
tube, and high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC)
specimens. PDLIM2 protein expression is significantly
decreased in HGSC specimens (Figure 1A). Further
RT-PCR analysis revealed PDLIM2 mRNA level is
significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared
to normal ovary and fallopian tube tissues (Figure 1B).
We next investigated previously published microarray data
regarding PDLIM2 expression in the Oncomine database.
PDLIM2 mRNA levels were decreased in ovarian cancer
tissues compared to normal tissue in the Yoshihara and

Hendrix datasets (P=1.22E-4 and P=1.87E-7, respectively)
(Figure 1C). We next performed quantitative real-time
PCR and immunoblotting to respectively determine
PDLIM2 mRNA and protein levels in ovarian cancer
cells and control HOSE cells. Both PDLIM2 mRNA
levels and protein levels are significantly decreased in all
ovarian cancer cell lines compared to control (Figure 2A
and 2B). Survival analysis revealed PDLIM2 repression
was associated with decreased progression-free survival,
overall survival, and post-progression survival (Figure
1D). These data suggest PDLIM2 protein expression is
repressed in ovarian cancer, and its decreased expression is
associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients.

OVCAR-3 cells (Figure 3A) and Caov-3 cells (Figure
3B) expressing PDLIM2 formed markedly fewer and
smaller colonies compared to control, suggesting PDLIM2
suppresses ovarian cancer growth in vitro. To validate
these observations in vivo, we separately incubated the
control vector and PDLIM2-expressing ovarian cancer
cells subcutaneously in nude mice. As shown in Figure
3C and 3D, both control vector and PDLIM2-expressing
cells of OVCAR-3 and Caov-3 cells developed tumors
subcutaneously in nude mice. However, PDLIM2expressing ovarian cancer cells were significantly smaller
than those formed by the vector-expressing cell lines.
Taken together, these data support PDLIM2-mediated
suppression of ovarian cancer cell tumorigenicity.

PDLIM2 repression in ovarian cancer involves
DNA methylation

To further investigate the effect of PDLIM2
expression in ovarian cancer, we performed a colony
formation assay, employing OVCAR-3 and Caov-3
cells expressing PDLIM2 versus empty vector. Both

Next, we investigated the underlying mechanism of
PDLIM2 repression in ovarian cancer, and asssessed the
potential role of DNA methylation, a major mechanism

responsible for tumor suppressor gene suppression in
malignant cells. We first analyzed the expression levels
of three DNA methyltransferases responsible for DNA
methylation (DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b). All
three enzymes were significantly increased in each ovarian
cancer cell line compared to nontumorigenic HOSE cells
(albeit to different degrees Figure 4A). To further establish
a correlation between DNA methyltransferase and
PDLIM2 expression, we determined the effect of 5-azadC, a highly specific DNA methyltransferase inhibitor,
upon cancer cell PDLIM2 expression. 5-aza-dC treatment
restored PDLIM2 expression in all studied ovarian cancer
cell lines (Figure 4B). These data suggest PDLIM2
repression in ovarian cancer involves DNA methylation.
Interestingly, 5-aza-dC treatment also resulted
in growth inhibition of OVCAR-3 and Caov-3 ovarian
cancer cells (Figure 4C and 4D). To determine whether the
PDLIM2 promoter is methylated in ovarian cancer cells,
and whether 5-aza-dC–mediated restoration of PDLIM2
expression involves inhibition of PDLIM2 promoter
methylation, we performed bisulfite genomic DNA

sequencing. The PDLIM2 promoter was hypermethylated
in ovarian cancer cell lines compared to HOSE cells
(Figure 4E). 5-aza-dC administration significantly reduced
methylation of the PDLIM2 promoter. Together, these data
suggest promoter methylation is an important modulating
factor in the expression of PDLIM2 in ovarian cancer.

PDLIM2 inhibition increases endogenous NO
level
We next investigated consequential downstream
molecular events of PDLIM2 repression in ovarian
cancer. We first compared the NO production capacity of
PDLIM2-repressed OVCAR-3 and Caov-3 ovarian cancer
cells by measuring nitrite (NO2-, a stable byproduct of NO)
in culture medium. Both siPDLIM2-treated OVCAR-3
and Caov-3 ovarian cancer cells produced significantly
more NO than control (Figure 5A), suggesting PDLIM2
repression may increase NO synthesis. To investigate the
function of endogenous NO in ovarian cancer cells, we

NOS2 expression is increased in PDLIM2repressed ovarian cancer cells

transfected OVCAR-3 and Caov-3 ovarian cancer cells
with E. coli FlavoHb, a potent NO-consuming enzyme
that converts NO to nitrate (NO3-) (Figure 5B and 5C).
FlavoHb reduced NO synthesis in PDLIM2-repressed
ovarian cancer cells (Figure 5D), and inhibited both
OVCAR-3 and Caov-3 cellular growth (Figure 5E and
5F). Taken together, these data suggest PDLIM2 inhibition
increases endogenous NO levels, with increased resultant
ovarian cancer cell growth.

Although we demonstrated FlavoHb blocked NO
availability and decreased ovarian cancer cell growth,
the source of PDLIM2-repressed cell-derived NO
remains unclear. There are three isoforms of nitric oxide
synthases: NOS1, NOS2 (iNOS), and NOS3 (eNOS).

Inhibition of NO synthesis attenuates ovarian
cancer growth in vitro and in vivo

We determined the mRNA and expression levels of these
three NOS isoforms to identify which is responsible for
increased NO synthesis in PDLIM2-repressed ovarian
cancer cells. Via RT-PCR analysis, both OVCAR-3 and
Caov-3 ovarian cancer cells exhibit elevated NOS2 mRNA
levels after siPDLIM2 treatment (Figure 6A), consistent
with the finding confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure
6B). No significant change was observed in the NOS1 and
NOS3 mRNA levels (Figure 6A). Immunohistochemistry
analysis revealed NOS2 expression is significantly
increased in PDLIM2-repressed ovarian cancer specimens
(Figure 6C). Correlation analysis demonstrated tumor
expression of NOS2 is negatively correlated with PDLIM2
levels (r2=0.2082; P=0.0328) in ovarian cancer specimens,
suggesting a functional link between the two factors
(Figure 6D). Additionally, survival analysis revealed
increased expression of NOS2 was associated with
decreased progression-free survival and overall survival
(Figure 6E). These data demonstrate NOS2 may be an
important mediator in PDLIM2-repression-induced NO
synthesis in ovarian cancer.

To further evaluate the functional import of NO in
ovarian cancer growth, we assessed OVCAR-3 and Caov3 cells in vitro during conditions of impaired NOS2/NO
signaling. Both NOS2 inhibitor 1400W (Figure 7A) and
PTIO (Figure 7B) significantly reduced the growth rate
of siPDLIM2-treated ovarian cancer cells compared with
control. To directly determine the importance of NOS2
in siPDLIM2-treated ovarian cell growth, we employed
NOS2-targeting siRNA for functional validation. Impaired
NOS2 expression reduced siPDLIM2-treated OVCAR-3
and Caov-3 cell growth in vitro, compared to control
(Figure 7C and 7D). To examine the role of NO synthesis
in ovarian cancer growth in vivo, we treated PDLIM2-repressed OVCAR-3 and Caov-3 cancer cells with
NOS2 siRNA or control. NOS2-siRNA decreased both
OVCAR-3 (Figure 8A) and Caov-3 (Figure 8B) cancer
cell growth in vivo, in statistically significant fashion
(Figure 8C and 8D). These data support the implications
of NOS2-induced NO synthesis upon ovarian cancer cell
growth.

ovarian cancer.
PDLIM2 has a PDZ domain (that binds with the
actin cy­toskeleton via α-actinin) and a LIM do­main
(that has potential to associate with different protein
partners). PDLIM2 shuttles between the cytoskeleton
and nucleus, and participates in cytoskeletal signaling,
cellular polarization, and cellular migration[9]. Recent
studies has demonstrated PDLIM2 specifically targets
nuclear p65 for polyubiquitination-mediated proteasomal
degradation, terminating NF-KB activation [7]. It has
been suggested the C-terminal LIM domain of PDLIM2
is required for promoting ubiquitination of nuclear p65,
while its N-terminal PDZ domain shuttles nuclear p65
along the nuclear framework into discrete intranuclear
compartments for proteasome-mediated degradation [8].
Correspondingly, PDLIM2 knock-out mice are more
sensitive to lipopolysaccharide-induced shock due to
enhanced p65 activation and subsequently augmented
production of inflammatory cytokines [8]. Apart from its
involvment in inflammation, its role as a tumor suppressor
has also been highlighted. PDLIM2 is repressed in a
variety of tumors, including breast [7] and colon cancer
[10]. The molecular mechanisms underlying its decreased
expression involve promoter methylation. Heretofore,
whether PDLIM2 is similarly repressed in ovarian cancer
has not been investigated. Our current study demonstrated
PDLIM2 is epigenetically repressed in ovarian cancer,
and restoration of PDLIM2 significantly impaired ovarian
cancer growth, suggesting an important role of PDLIM2
in ovarian cancer development.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important regulator of
a variety of physiological functions, but continuous
exposure to moderate-to-high concentrations of NO may
lead to pathological processes such as inflammation,
apoptosis, and tumorigenesis [11]. iNOS–NO signaling has
been reported to be closely correlated with tumorigenesis,
but its contribution in ovarian cancer pathogenesis remain
unknown. Previous studies have reported homeoprotein
DLX4 regulated inducible nitric oxide synthase-mediated
angiogenesis in ovarian cancer [12]. Moreover, Caneba et
al. demonstrated NO positively orchestrated the Warburg
effect (increased glycolysis with reduced mitochondrial
activity during aerobic conditions). NO promotes
tumor growth and inhibits mitochondrial respiration in
OVCA cells, metabolically shifting these cells towards
glycolysis to maintain ATP production. Additionally, NO
increases TCA cycle flux and glutaminolysis, suggesting
NO decreases ROS levels by increasing NADPH and
glutathione levels [13]. Our study demonstrated NOS2
expression was increased in PDLIM2-repressed ovarian
cancer cells , increasing intracellular NO synthesis in
ovarian cancer cells. Via NO synthesis inhibition, we
demonstrated PDLIM2-deficient ovarian cancer cells grow
in a NO-dependent manner. Taken together, our results
support the vital role NO signaling plays in PDLIM2repressed ovarian cancer cell growth.

Previous investigations have demonstrated
macrophage infiltration in the tumor microenvironment
favors tumor growth, angiogenesis, inflammation,
metastasis/invasion, and immunosuppression through
production of various factors promoting tumor
progression. These factors serve as the interface
between cancer cells and monocytes/macrophages under
inflammatory stimuli in vitro and in vivo. Macrophages
supporting aggressively malignant tumors are mostly the
M2 type [14]. The number of M2 type tumor-associated
macrophages is correlated with prognosis in different
cancer types, including ovarian cancer [15]. Our study
demonstrated the percentage of M2 type tumor-associated
macrophages is significantly increased in PDLIM2deficient ovarian cancer specimens of nude mice model
compared to control, suggesting the likely involvement of
M2 type tumor-associated macrophages with PDLIM2repressed ovarian cancer cell growth.
Taken together, our data demonstrated PDLIM2
is repressed in ovarian cancer cells compared to
normal tissue. Functional analysis revealed PDLIM2 is
epigenetically repressed by DNA methylation in ovarian
cancer, which is conducive to cellular growth both in
vivo and in vitro via NOS2-derived nitric oxide signaling.
M2 type macrophages recruitment was increased in
the PDLIM2-repressed ovarian cancer tissue tumor
microenvironment. Our results support an important role
of PDLIM2 in ovarian cancer pathogenesis, which might
be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of
ovarian cancer.

Immunohistochemistry

1 ml sample with 5 ml methanol, followed by 1 hour of
incubation at −80 °C. Samples were pelleted, dried, and
subjected to further immunoblotting. All signals were
quantified by QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad), and
defined as the ratio of target protein to β-actin.

Paraffin-embedded normal ovary, fallopian tube, and
ovarian cancer specimens were obtained from 43 patients,
who had undergone surgical resection from 2009 to 2010.
Immunohistochemistry was performed utilizing primary
antibodies, including mouse anti-PDLIM2 (diluted 1:200;
abcam), rabbit anti-NOS2 (diluted 1:200; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-CD163 (diluted 1:200;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as previously described
(12). 10 random images per section were captured, and
immunohistochemical staining positivity was determined
by calculating the percentage of positive cells and
immunostain intensity via Image-Pro Plus version 6.0
(Media Cybernetics, Baltimore, MD). Staining intensities
ranged 0 to 10. The mean value of staining intensity of 10
captured images was considered each specimen’s staining
score. All slides were evaluated by two independent
pathologists in a double-blinded manner. Any discrepancy
between the two evaluators was resolved by re-evaluation
and open deliberation until agreement was reached.

Cell growth assays
Cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of
5,000 cells per well. Cells received 5-aza-dC (5 μmol/L)
or vehicle treatment. The drug-containing medium was
replenished each day. Cell density was determined by
replacing the medium with 2 μmol/L of calcein AM in 1×
dissociation solution (Trevigen) at indicated time points.
After 1 hour incubation, diesterase activity (in relative
fluorescence units) was measured via Tecan Infinite 200
Microplate Reader (excitation wavelength 485 nm and
emission wavelength 520 nm).

Colony formation assay
100 cells were counted and seeded in triplicate in
a 6-well plate, and cultured continuously for 14 days. All
subsequent clones were stained with crystal violet and
counted via light microscopy. Any clusters exceeding 50
cells was considered a clone, and clonogenic formation
rate was calculated.

Real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was obtained with TRIzol reagent.
cDNA was generated with SuperScript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR assays were
conducted as previously described. Primer pairs were
PDLIM2 (forward 5’-GCCCATCATGGTGACTAAGG,

Bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing
Genomic DNA from 5-aza-dC–treated or mocktreated cells was isolated via PureLink Genomic DNA
Purification Kit (Invitrogen) per manufacturer’s protocol.
Subsequently, genomic DNA aliquots were treated
with sodium bisulfite via EZ DNA Methylation-Gold
Kit (Zymo Research), followed by PCR to amplify the
PDLIM2 promoter by Hot-Start Taq enzyme (Qiagen).
Primers were designed to recognize the bisulfite-modified
regions (−1084 to −800) of the PDLIM2 promoter
(forward 5′-AGAGGAGTTTATATATATTTAGG, reverse
5′-TACCTAACAACCCTCTCTCC). The PCR products
were then directly employed for DNA sequencing or
subcloned into the SmaI restriction site of pEGFP-N2
(Clontech) for single colony sequencing to determine the
methylation status of the CpG dinucleotides within the
PDLIM2 promoter.

Data set and survival analysis
The Oncomine database provides publicly available
data sets concerning cancer gene expression. The
Oncomine database was searched to further compare the
expression levels of PDLIM2 and NOS2 in normal tissues
and ovarian carcinomas. Kaplan Meier survival analysis
data of ovarian cancer patients from the Australian
Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS) was collected [17].

Xenograft study

Immunoblot

Xenograft experiments were conducted per national
guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of Sichuan University (Chengdu,
Sichuan, China), as done previously [19]. Briefly, 2×106
cancer cells were subcutaneously injected in the right

For immunoblotting, whole cell lysates were
prepared as previously described [18]. Proteins from
conditioned medium samples were precipitated by mixing

flank of 5-7 week old severely combined immunodeficient
(SCID) mice. Tumor growth was assessed over time
by twice weekly physical examination and palpation.
Mice were sacrificed 21 days after inoculation. Tumors
were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -75°C for
subsequent analyses.

To determine cellular nitrite production,
conditioned supernatants or nitrite standards were
added to 4,5-diaminofluorescein (DAF-2; Cayman
Chemical). Samples were analyzed post-acidification and
neutralization for fluorescence (measured with lex=488nm
and lem=525 nm). All results were normalized to cellular
protein content (measured by Bradford assay; Bio-Rad).

Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 5.0d for Mac (GraphPad Software)
was utilized for all statistical analyses. Data was reported
as mean±standard deviation. Student’s t test (twotailed) assessed the significance of differences between
two groups. p values<0.05 and 0.01 were respectively
considered statistically significant and highly statistically
significant. Spearman correlation analyzed the potential
correlation between two different experimental parameters
(*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01).
