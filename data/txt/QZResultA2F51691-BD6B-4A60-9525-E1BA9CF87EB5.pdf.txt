Abstract
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are clinically relevant because they are used as anticancer drugs. Recent
evidence sheds light on an intriguing connection among the DNA damage response (DDR), protein acetylation,
and autophagy. HDAC inhibitors have been shown to counteract key steps in the cellular response to doublestrand break formation by affecting checkpoint activation, homologous recombination–mediated repair of DNA
lesions, and stability of crucial enzymes involved in resection of DNA ends. The degradation of the resection
factors depends on autophagy, which plays a detrimental role when cells are in a hyperacetylated state and
experience treatment with radiomimetic anticancer drugs. Future work will be required to further investigate the
mechanisms underlying the link between acetylation, autophagy, and the DDR, as well as the signiﬁcance of
mTORC1 inhibitors, which are potent inducers of autophagy that are now used in cancer treatment. Cancer Res;

Introduction
One hallmark of cancer and aging cells is an unstable
genome, which results from DNA damage. Eukaryotic cells
developed intricate surveillance mechanisms to maintain
their genome integrity and to repair DNA lesions. Following
genotoxic stress, the evolutionary conserved DNA damage
response (DDR) is activated and, in turn, coordinates DNA
repair with cell-cycle events. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the
DDR is mediated by two phosphoinositide 3-kinases: Mec1
(ATR in humans) and Tel1 (ATM in humans). ATR senses
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) coated with replication protein
A (RPA), whereas ATM monitors the presence of DNA breaks.
This mediation of the DDR results in activation of signal
transduction pathways, which involves the Rad53 (Chk2 in
humans) and Chk1 (Chk1 in humans) kinases (1). These
cascades end in phosphorylation of several substrates involved
in cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair (2). Defects in the DDR
pathway components can lead to genome instability and
cancer. In fact, several studies showed that replication stress
and double-strand breaks (DSB), which lead to activation of
DDR, occur in early tumor lesions (3, 4).

DSBs can arise spontaneously as a consequence of certain
metabolic reactions, can be induced by extrinsic genotoxic
events, such as ionizing radiation, or can occur in a programmed manner as in meiosis. These lesions must be promptly repaired to prevent loss of genetic material and maintain
genome integrity. Induction of a single DSB is sufﬁcient to
activate the DDR in mitotically growing cells (5). In G2, DSBs
are typically repaired by the homologous recombination (HR)
pathway, which is initiated by 50 -end resection followed by the
coating of 30 -ssDNA overhangs with RPA. The RPA–ssDNA
nucleoﬁlaments are thought to be the signal for ATR activation
(6). S. cerevisiae has been instrumental in elucidating the
conserved pathways involved in DSB repair. Several proteins
mediate the resection process, including the MRX complex
that consists of Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2, Sae2, Exo1, Sgs1, as well as
Dna2 (7). RPA is then exchanged with Rad51, the RecA strand
exchange protein, which in turn promotes DNA recombination
processes. Inefﬁcient and/or faulty DSB repair inevitably lead
to genome rearrangements and cancer. A new phenomenon,
called chromothripsis, has recently been described in cancer
cells (8). It involves the rearrangement of broken chromosomes
and can be acquired from one cellular catastrophic event.
Remarkably, cells can survive such a crisis by selectively
rearranging their genomes, although the consequence is
cancer.
Regulation of expression and activity of key DNA repair and
checkpoint proteins is essential and is mediated partly by
posttranslational modiﬁcations (PTM), such as acetylation,
phosphorylation, or ubiquitination. Cross-talk between different PTMs is key for regulation of DNA repair pathways.
Acetylation, which is mediated by acetyltransferases (HAT)
and histone deacetylases (HDAC), not only affects gene expression through its modulation of histone tails but also has
recently been implicated in regulating nonhistone proteins.
Intriguingly, a large class of acetylated proteins is involved in

Autophagy and DNA Damage Response

DNA damage and repair; examples include p53, ATM, Ku70,
and Exo1 (9). The biologic signiﬁcance of protein acetylation is
largely not understood.

Valproic Acid Reveals a Link between Acetylation
and Double-Strand Break Repair
HDAC inhibitors are currently used in cancer treatment (9).
To investigate the importance of protein acetylation in the
yeast DSB repair pathway, Robert and colleagues (10) used
valproic acid (VPA), a U.S. Food and Drug Administration–
approved antiepileptic drug shown to be an HDAC class I and II
inhibitor and, therefore, now used in cancer clinical trials (11).
Cells experiencing a single irreparable DSB were treated
with VPA to induce a hyperacetylated state. Intriguingly, VPA
treatment counteracted DDR activation. The authors then
dissected the steps of DSB repair that are defective in VPAtreated cells and found that DSB resection rates were slower in
VPA. They found that, whereas loading of Mre11 at the DSB site
was unaffected, its unloading seemed to be defective in VPA.
This phenotype resembled that of sae2 cells (12), raising the
possibility that Sae2 endonuclease might be nonfunctional in
VPA. Indeed, the levels of Sae2 protein in VPA-treated cells
signiﬁcantly declined. This ﬁnding not only applies to Sae2 but
also to Exo1, suggesting that the DSB repair defect in VPA is
due to the absence of at least these 2 critical nucleases
implicated in resection. Consistently, Sae2 protein is hyperacetylated in VPA-treated cells.
A previous study by Kaidi and colleagues showed that CtIP,
the mammalian counterpart of Sae2, is also acetylated in
mammalian cells (13), indicating that acetylation as a PTM
on Sae2/CtIP is highly conserved. Interestingly, also in mammals, a hyperacetylated state induced by treatments with
HDAC inhibitors led to DSB repair defects, although CtIP
degradation was not reported. Although acetylation of Exo1
was described in mammals (9), it was not found in yeast (10).

A Role for Autophagy in DNA Damage Response
An interesting study by Jeong and colleagues showed that
mutant Huntingtin (Htt) protein, which undergoes acetylation,
is degraded by macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy
hereon; ref. 14). Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic
process involved in degradation of cytoplasmic components in
the vacuole (lysosomes in humans). During autophagy, a
double-membrane vesicle, named the autophagosome, forms
and nonspeciﬁcally engulfs the cytoplasmic material that
typically includes organelles, pathogens, or protein aggregates.
Upon fusion of the autophagosome with the vacuole, the
content is released and consequently gets degraded by lysosomal enzymes. This degradation allows recycling of amino
acids and nutrients that are necessary for survival of cells under
stress conditions.
Much of our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms
underlying autophagy comes from S. cerevisiae (15). Although
autophagy largely occurs on a nonspeciﬁc basis, several selective types of autophagy also exist; examples include pexophagy,
mitophagy, and the cytoplasm to vacuole (CvT) pathway. CvT
takes place in nutrient-rich conditions and mediates the

www.aacrjournals.org

transport of the precursor vacuolar hydrolases aminopeptidase 1 and a-mannosidase from the cytoplasm into the vacuole. In S. cerevisiae, 34 autophagy (ATG) genes have been
identiﬁed to date, some of which are shared among all autophagy subpathways and constitute the core machinery needed
for membrane formation. Autophagy is initiated by activation
of the essential Ser/Thr kinase Atg1 and is induced most
commonly by nutrient starvation and in response to several
stimuli, such as treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, which is currently used in the clinic as an anticancer
agent, suggesting that inhibition of mTOR might have important therapeutic values in cancer prevention (16).
The link between mutant Htt protein acetylation and its
autophagy-dependent degradation suggested that autophagy
could also account for Sae2 degradation. Indeed, genetic and
chemical inactivation of autophagy, more speciﬁcally the CvT
pathway, rescued Sae2 degradation in VPA. Moreover, induction of autophagy by rapamycin resulted in Sae2 degradation.
These lines of evidence support the notion that autophagy
negatively inﬂuences DSB repair in a hyperacetylated state.

Sae2 Is Regulated by Gcn5, Hda1, and Rpd3
To uncover the identity of HDACs and HATs that mediate
regulation of Sae2 acetylation status, the authors monitored
Sae2 stability in strains deleted for both HDA1 (class 1) and
RPD3 (class 2). Indeed, Sae2 is destabilized in hda1 rpd3 cells.
This ﬁnding recapitulates the effect of VPA, validating the
mechanism of action of VPA through HDAC inhibition and
indicating that Hda1 and Rpd3 are at least 2 HDAC targets of
VPA involved in the DDR. Gcn5 HAT, a member of the SAGA
HAT family in mammals, opposes the effect of Hda1 and Rpd3
(17). Consistently, deletion of GCN5 resulted in the suppression
of Sae2 degradation in VPA and rapamycin. These ﬁndings
suggest that interplay among Gcn5, Hda1, and Rpd3 regulates
the acetylation status of Sae2 and, thus, its stability during DSB
repair. Interestingly, in mammals, the SIRT6 HDAC has been
implicated in CtIP acetylation and in DSB repair (13). SIRT6
belongs to class III HDACs, suggesting a role of other HDACs in
the DDR pathways.

A Working Model
Robert and colleagues proposed the following model on
the basis of their study (Fig. 1A): upon DSB formation, the
MRX complex is recruited to DSB sites, followed by Sae2 and
Exo1, which remain in a deacetylated state in an Hda1/Rpd3dependent manner. Once resection takes place, Gcn5 (and
likely other HATs) mediate hyperacetylation of Sae2 (AcSae2), triggering its degradation by autophagy. Because
autophagy takes place in the cytoplasm, it is likely that
Ac-Sae2, along with Exo1 and additional unknown targets, is
exported into the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore.
Piecemeal microautophagy of nucleus (PMN) has been
reported in S. cerevisiae and has been shown to take place
at nucleus–vacuole junctions (18). PMN depends on several
autophagy genes, including ATG1. Another possibility, which
remains to be addressed, is that Ac-Sae2 degradation takes
place in a PMN-dependent manner.

Figure 1. A, working model based on ﬁndings reported by Robert and colleagues (10). Upon DSB induction, the MRX complex forms at DSB ends, followed by
the consecutive recruitment of Sae2 and Exo1 nucleases, which remain hypoacetylated in an Hda1- and Rpd3-mediated manner. Resection takes place, and
ultimately the Mec1-Ddc2 complex is activated, followed by autophosphorylation of Rad53 kinase. Sae2 (and likely other targets) undergoes Gcn5-dependent
acetylation, which may trigger the formation of a large protein complex that is exported from the nucleus and becomes destined for vacuolar degradation by
the CvT autophagy subpathway. B, both rapamycin and HDAC inhibitors, including VPA, trigger autophagy, which then counteracts DSB repair. The
mechanism(s) underlying VPA-induced autophagy remain(s) to be elucidated but will be important to unravel, given the therapeutic value of HDAC inhibitors in
cancer treatment.

Perspectives
A future challenge is to further elucidate the contribution of
the different autophagy pathways in regulating the DDR.
Autophagy is involved in degradation of long-lived proteins
and in recycling of macromolecular components. Perhaps
acetylated Sae2 and other DSB repair proteins (including Exo1)
form large complexes and, thus, difﬁcult substrates for ubiquitylation. Hence, after their use, autophagy might represent
the only degradation pathway mediating their recycling. In
fact, the acetylome study conducted in human cells showed
that large protein complexes undergo acetylation (9), which
may signal their degradation by autophagy.
Increasing evidence in the literature shows that autophagy is induced in response to DNA damage (19). In addition
to the recent link between autophagy and DNA damage in
S. cerevisiae (10), Dyavaiah and colleagues (20) showed that
a subunit of ribonucleotide reductase Rnr1 is also regulated
in an autophagy-dependent manner (20). It is important to
note that DNA-damaging agents also cause protein damage
(21), which in turn may induce stress pathways such as
autophagy as a survival mechanism to degrade damaged
proteins or aggregates.
The physiologic role of autophagy has recently been a topic
of debate (22). Autophagy has a cytoprotective role and is
needed for survival during development, aging, and pathogen
invasion. Defects in autophagy genes lead to predisposition to
cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (22). In fact, a strong
correlation exists between autophagy induction and tumor
suppression. On the other hand, autophagy can have a cytotoxic effect because tumor cells can rely on it for survival or
healthy cells can be killed by excessive autophagy. The yeast

1334

Cancer Res; 72(6) March 15, 2012

studies suggest that autophagy has a negative impact on cell
survival when cells in a hyperacetylated state are exposed to
radiomimetic drugs (10).
The study by Robert and colleagues has raised many questions. Pathways that regulate autophagy are well characterized
and include TOR1, Ras-PKA, Snf1 AMP kinase (AMPK in
humans), as well as Sch9 kinase (S6K and/or PKB in humans;
ref. 23). It will be interesting to investigate the mechanism(s)
underlying autophagy induction by VPA or other HDAC inhibitors that are currently in clinical development. In mammalian cells, VPA activates autophagy in an mTOR-independent
manner (24, 25); however, in yeast, the target pathway of VPA
is still unknown. Moreover, the precise mechanism underlying the CvT-mediated degradation of Sae2 and Exo1 (and
likely other targets) should be explored further. Cross-talk
between autophagy and the proteasome has been reported
(26), and whether it takes place during DSB repair should be
investigated.
One study conducted in breast cancer cells showed that
rapamycin affects DSB repair pathways, HR, and nonhomologous end joining (27). Consistently, the report by Robert and
colleagues further pinpoints that the DDR can be counteracted
by rapamycin and HDAC inhibitors. Rapamycin and its analogs, rapalogues, have effective antitumor activity and are
currently used either alone or in combination with anticancer
drugs (16). Ongoing clinical trials that rely on combining
rapamycin with genotoxic drugs should be evaluated in light
of these recent ﬁndings.
Although much attention has been granted to DNA damage
repair pathways, protein damage likely plays a signiﬁcant role
in response to genotoxic stress. Thus, the theme of nutritional

pathways such as autophagy will become more common in the
genome integrity ﬁeld. From the therapeutic perspective,
mechanistic studies aimed at understanding the interplay
among autophagy, DSB resection and acetylation, and drug
intervention designed for autophagy and/or DDR cross-talk
might aid in the development of more effective cancer
treatments.
