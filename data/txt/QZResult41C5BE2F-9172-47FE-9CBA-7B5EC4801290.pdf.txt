ABSTRACT
We previously reported that ATP7B is involved in cisplatin resistance and ATP7A
confers multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells.
In this study, we show that ATP7B expressing cells also are resistant to
doxorubicin, SN-38, etoposide, and paclitaxel as well as cisplatin.
In ATP7B expressing cells, doxorubicin relocated from the nuclei to the lateendosome at 4 hours after doxorubicin exposure. EGFP-ATP7B mainly colocalized
with doxorubicin.
ATP7B has six metal binding sites (MBSs) in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region.
To investigate the role of the MBSs of ATP7B in doxorubicin resistance, we used three
mutant ATP7B (Cu0, Cu6 and M6C/S) expressing cells. Cu0 has no MBSs, Cu6 has
only the sixth MBS and M6C/S carries CXXC to SXXS mutation in the sixth MBS. Cu6
expressing cells were less resistance to the anticancer agents than wild type ATP7B
expressing cells, and had doxorubicin sequestration in the late-endosome. Cu0- and
M6C/S-expressing cells were sensitive to doxorubicin. In these cells, doxorubicin did
not relocalize to the late-endosome. EGFP-M6C/S mainly localized to the trans-Golgi
network (TGN) even in the presence of copper. Thus the cysteine residues in the sixth
MBS of ATP7B are essential for MDR phenotype.
Finally, we found that ammonium chloride and tamoxifen suppressed late
endosomal sequestration of doxorubicin, thereby attenuating drug resistance. These
results suggest that the sequestration depends on the acidity of the vesicles partly.
We here demonstrate that ATP7B confers MDR by facilitating nuclear drug efflux
and late endosomal drug sequestration.

in animal cells [1–3]. Several mutations of ATP7A
and ATP7B are causes of Menkes and Wilson disease
respectively [4].
In the other hand, we previously found that high
expression of ATP7B confers resistance against cisplatin
and this has since been confirmed by other groups
[5–7]. ATP7B expression has been reported as a poor

INTRODUCTION
ATP7A and ATP7B are copper transporters existing
in the Golgi membrane and share 67% amino acid identity.
They have six metal binding sites (MBS) in the N-terminal
cytoplasmic region and 8 membrane spanning segments.

Ɨ Indicates statistically significant ( p <0.05)
prognostic marker in some cancers receiving cisplatinbase chemotherapy [8, 9] . ATP7A also has been reported
to confer cisplatin resistance [10].
Additionally we indicated that ATP7A expressing
cells are resistant against not only cisplatin but also a
variety of anticancer agents including doxorubicin, SN38, etoposide, vincristine and paclitaxel through vesicle
transport dependent ways. Surgically resected ATP7A
positive human colon tumor cells were significantly
resistant to SN-38 than ATP7A negative cells ex vivo [11].
That means ATP7A confers multidrug resistance (MDR)
of cancer cells and related to drug resistance in clinical
cancer cells.
MDR is a characteristic that the cells are resistant
to multiple structurally unrelated anticancer agents and
an obstacle for successful cancer chemotherapy. MDR
is caused by expression of some ABC transporters,
modification of DNA repair systems, apoptosis defects
and several more mechanisms [12, 13]. However there are
no established therapies to overcome MDR in practice so
far [14, 15].
Here we evaluated drug sensitivities of ATP7B
expressing cells to make clear that ATP7B also confers
MDR and examined the mechanism of ATP7B mediated
drug resistance with mutant ATP7B expressing cells and
imaging of doxorubicin localization.

doxorubicin (17.25fold), SN-38 (38.14 fold), etoposide
(25.84 fold), and paclitaxel (2.00 fold) as well as cisplatin
(12.03fold) in comparison with KB/EV, pRC/CMV
plasmid transfected KB-3-1 cells (Table 1).

Doxorubicin localizes to the late endosome in
ATP7B-expressing cells
Doxorubicin has an intrinsic red fluorescence that
allows observation of its localization. We observed the
intracellular distribution of doxorubicin at 0 time and at
4 hours after doxorubicin treatment and washing with
PBS with confocal laser fluorescence microscopy. In KB/
EV cells, doxorubicin was localized predominantly to the
nuclei at both time points (Figure 1a, 1b). Alternatively, in
KB/WD cells, doxorubicin was localized in the nuclei at 0
time but after 4 hours, was predominantly localized in the
cytoplasm (Figure 1c, 1d).
To determine the cytoplasmic localization of
doxorubicin in ATP7B expressing cells, we observed
doxorubicin distribution in the Green Fluorescence Protein
(GFP)-Golgi or GFP-late endosome transfected cells in
the presence of bathocuproine disulphonate (BCS), a
copper chelate, at 4 hours after doxorubicin exposure.
Doxorubicin in KB/WD cells predominantly co-localized
with GFP-late endosomes and not with GFP-Golgi
(Figure 2). Therefore, doxorubicin is sequestrated into the
late endosome compartment from the nuclei in ATP7B
expressing cells independent of copper.

RESULTS
Resistance to anticancer agents of ATP7B
expressing cells

ATP7B localizes to the late endosome in the
presence of doxorubicin

We previously reported that ATP7A confers
resistance against a wide variety of anticancer agents in
addition to cisplatin [11]. We first examined whether wt
ATP7B expressing KB/WD cells are resistant to anticancer
agents other than cisplatin by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. We
found that KB/WD cells are significantly resistant to

Not only copper but also cisplatin causes the
relocalization of ATP7B from the trans-Golgi network
(TGN) to the peripheral vesicles [6, 16]. We examined
the localization of ATP7B after exposure of doxorubicin
using EGFP-wt ATP7B transfection to KB-3-1 cells. When
BCS is used to deplete copper, EGFP-ATP7B mainly

colocalized with RFP-Golgi (Supplementary Figure 1a and
1b). By contrast in the presence of copper, EGFP-ATP7B
localizes to the late endosome (Supplementary Figure
1c and 1d). These results are consistent with that copper
levels influence the localization of ATP7B and result in its
change from the TGN to the late endosome as previously
reported [17, 18].
Next, we examined the effect of doxorubicin
on ATP7B localization in EGFP-ATP7B transiently
transfected KB-3-1 cells in the presence of BCS. The
ATP7B colocalized with doxorubicin in the late endosome
at 4 hours after doxorubicin treatment (Figure 3a).
Therefore, doxorubicin, copper, and cisplatin alter the
ATP7B subcellular localization from the TGN to the late
endosome [6, 16]. These results suggest that ATP7B can
be activated with a metal unrelated chemical agent.

The protein expression of wild type (wt) and mutant
ATP7B was examined by immunoblotting using anti-HA
antibody (Figure 1b). The expression of each ATP7B
protein was comparable in each cell line. Full-length wt
ATP7B and M6C/S (170 kDa) and the ATP7B deletion
mutants, Cu0 and Cu6, were detected at their expected
sizes 120 kDa and 125 kDa respectively (Figure 4b).
In MTT assay, KB/Cu0 cells were sensitive to
the agents, suggesting that the cytoplasmic MBSs
are important for resistance to doxorubicin and other
anticancer agents. KB/Cu6 cells were more resistant to
cisplatin (3.30-fold), doxorubicin (7.4-fold), SN-38 (5.7fold), etoposide (21.7-fold), and paclitaxel (1.35-fold) than
KB/EV cells, but less resistant than KB/WD wt ATP7Bexpressing cells. KB/M6C/S cells were sensitive to these
agents (Table 1). These results suggest that MBS6 of
ATP7B is critical for doxorubicin resistance while MBSs
1-5 increase resistance but are not required.
To identify where doxorubicin localizes in these
mutant ATP7B expressing cells, we observed doxorubicin
localization after transfection with GFP-late endosome.
In KB/Cu6 cells, which have some drug resistance,
doxorubicin was detected in both the cytoplasm and nuclei
at 4 hours after exposure and was partly co-localized
with the GFP-late endosome like KB/WD (Figure 5c). In
KB/M6C/S and KB/Cu0 cells, doxorubicin was mainly
localized in the nuclei (Figure 5a, 5b). Furthermore in
EGFP-M6C/S expressing KB-3-1 cells, doxorubicin
localized to the nuclei and EGFP-M6C/S protein localized
to cytoplasm differently from those in the EFGP-ATP7B
expressing cells (Figure 3).
Therefore, the cysteine residues of MBS6 are
essential for ATP7B mediated drug sequestration in the late
endosome. These results support that the sequestration of

The sixth metal binding site of ATP7B is critical
for doxorubicin resistance and relocalization of
ATP7B
In previous reports, the cytoplasmic MBSs,
especially the cysteine residues in the sixth MBS (MBS6)
of ATP7B are/is essential for copper transport and cisplatin
resistance [16, 19]. We examined whether the MBSs in
ATP7B are important for doxorubicin sequestration and
resistance.
Figure 4a presents a schematic drawing of the
N-terminus of ATP7B proteins used in this study as
described in the material and method. Cu0 has no MBSs,
Cu6 has only the sixth MBS and M6C/S carries CXXC to
SXXS mutation in the sixth MBS. Cu0, Cu6 and M6C/S
expressing KB-3-1 cells are named KB/Cu0, KB/Cu6 and
KB/M6C/S respectively.

doxorubicin is mediated by ATP7B through its interaction
with doxorubicin via MBS6.

by NH4Cl could increase the sensitivity of KB/WD cells
against doxorubicin and SN-38 (Figure 7).
In addition to NH4Cl, tamoxifen can reduce ATP7B
mediated drug resistance to doxorubicin, cisplatin, and
SN-38. However, the effects of cisplatin are weaker
than those of doxorubicin. This result is consistent with
doxorubicin being a weak base (pKa 9.53/8.94 strongest
acidic and strongest basic respectively), which allows
it to accumulate in the acidic vesicles, while cisplatin
(pKa 5.06) and SN-38 (pKa 9.68/3.91 strongest acidic
and strongest basic respectively) are more acidic and
acidification has weaker effect to accumulation of these
compounds. These results indicate that ATP7B mediated
doxorubicin sequestration partially depends on the acidity
of the vesicles.

Acidic condition in the vesicles contribute to
doxorubicin sequestration
To investigate whether doxorubicin sequestration in
the late endosome depends on the acidity of the vesicles,
we examined doxorubicin localization in the presence of
NH4Cl or tamoxifen. NH4Cl is a lysosomotropic agent that
inhibits sequestration of weakly basic molecules in the
vesicle by increasing the endo-lysosomal pH. Tamoxifen
inhibits acidification of endosomes and lysosomes without
increasing cytoplasmic pH [20, 21]. In the presence of
NH4Cl or tamoxifen, doxorubicin accumulated in the
nuclei and only slightly colocalized with the GFP-late
endosome (Figure 6). Next, we estimated whether NH4Cl
or tamoxifen could modify cell viability. The viability of
doxorubicin treated KB/WD cells significantly decreased
in the presence of both NH4Cl and tamoxifen, although
there was no remarkable change in that of KB/EV cells.
Preventing sequestration of drugs in the acidic vesicle

either ATP7B confers cisplatin resistance and that the
expression of ATP7A confers resistance to several

structurally unrelated anticancer drugs including
cisplatin [5, 11]. The involvement of ATP7B in resistance
to other anticancer drugs has not been investigated. Here
we show that ATP7B confers resistance to doxorubicin,
SN-38, etoposide, and paclitaxel, making ATP7B
another candidate of MDR.
ATP7B normally resides in the TGN of
hepatocytes. In the presence of elevated copper levels,
ATP7B is redistributed from the TGN to the late
endosome/lysosome compartments [17, 18]. Tagged wt
ATP7B localizes to the TGN under both copper- and
cisplatin-free conditions and is dispersed throughout
the cell after 1 hour of exposure to either cisplatin or
copper [6, 16]. Fluorescein-labeled cisplatin localizes
to the TGN and lysosome and colocalizes with both
ATP7B and ATP7A [6, 22]. Here we show that exposure
to doxorubicin also induces redistribution of ATP7B to
the late endosome, similar to exposure to copper and
cisplatin. Additionally, we show ATP7B facilitates efflux
from the nuclei and sequestration of doxorubicin to the
late-endosome. Taken together, these results suggest that

ATP7B is activated by doxorubicin as well as by copper
and cisplatin.
The CXXC motif in MBS6 of ATP7B is essential
for the transport of Cu and for trafficking in response to
cisplatin [16, 23, 24]. KB/M6C/S cells are sensitive to
cisplatin, doxorubicin, SN-38, etoposide and paclitaxel
suggesting that the CXXC motif of MBS6 is important
for resistance to these anticancer agents. Alternatively,
KB/Cu6 cells are resistance to these agents, but are less
resistant than KB/WD cells to them. The resistance of
the mutant-expressing cells to doxorubicin is correlated
with the amount of doxorubicin accumulation in the
late endosome based on our confocal microscopic study
(Figure 4 and 5). Thus, MBS6 is critical to drug resistance;
however, MBS6 alone is not sufficient to confer resistance
comparable to wt ATP7B. MBSs 1-5 have supportive roles
in the function of ATP7B.
Our results are compatible with previous studies
investigating the MBSs of ATP7B. The second MBS
in the N-terminal domain of ATP7B is important
in receiving copper from Atox1, a cytosolic copper
chaperone [25]. Platinum can also transfer copper to

the second MBS from Atox1 [26]. The fragment of
N-terminal ATP7B including MBSs 1-4 binds with the
copper-bound Atox1 in the yeast two hybrid system
[27]. Cisplatin also binds to MBSs 1-4 but not MBSs
5 or 6 of ATP7B based on studies using proteins
expressed in Escherichia coli [28]. Therefore, MBSs
1-4 might have higher affinity to the copper than MBS6.
These reports are consistent with MBSs 1-4 having a
supportive function of ATP7B transport activity. MBSs
1-5 is expected to also interact with doxorubicin since
KB/Cu6 cells are less resistant to anticancer agents in
comparison with KB/WD cells.
Cisplatin was shown to be transported by the
ATP7B-expressing vesicle using the baculovirus
expressing system [24]. Recently, electrical measurements
using a membrane fraction of ATP7A- or ATP7Bexpressing Cos-1 cells demonstrated a charge transfer in
the presence of cisplatin, indicating an ATP-dependent
vectorial displacement of a charged cisplatin complex
by ATP7A and ATP7B [29]. We previously showed that
SN-38 could be transported into the membrane vesicles

of ATP7A-expressing cells [11]. These results suggest
ATP7A and ATP7B directly transfer cisplatin or SN-38 to
acidic vesicles.
Since
many
chemotherapeutic
agents,
which target molecules including nucleic acids,
topoisomerases, and DNA polymerase, localize to
the nucleus, alteration of the intracellular distribution
of these chemicals strongly influences their efficacy
[30–32]. Vesicle acidification has been proposed to
play one of major roles in drug sequestration [33].
Previously, we found that in ATP7A-expressing cells,
monensin, which disturbs the acidity of the vesicles,
could relocate doxorubicin from intracellular vesicles
to the nuclei [11]. In our present study, the inhibition
of vesicle acidification with NH4Cl or tamoxifen
altered drug distribution and significantly reversed
the cell viability in ATP7B expressing cells. Thus,
ATP7B confers resistance through late endosomal
sequestration, which partly depends on acidification.
In this study indicates that ATP7B potentially
facilitate doxorubicin efflux from the nuclei and following

late endo-lysosomal drug sequestration, and confers drug
resistance to cancer cells. More detailed analysis of the
mechanism of drugs sequestration is required.
Appearance of drug resistant, especially MDR,
cells hinders successful chemotherapy treatments.
Several mechanisms of MDR, including expression
of some ABC transporters, increase detoxification,
DNA repair and apoptosis defects have been reported
[12, 13]. The therapy against MDR is not established,
one of the reason is not all mechanisms of MDR
have not been elucidated [14]. It has been reported
that ATP7B expression elevate in several human
malignancies, including ovarian, gastric, and breast
cancers when compared with non-cancer tissues
and its high expression is a poor prognostic marker
in ovarian and oral squamous cell cancers treated
with cisplatin-base chemotherapy [8, 34–36]. Using
PrognoScan (http://www.abren.net/PrognoScan/) we
found that high ATP7B expression is a poor prognosis
index in several neoplasms which non-platina base
chemotherapy are applied as standard protocol for:
AML (data set GSE8970: P<0.014613), DLBCL (data
set E-TABM-346: p<0.026222), follicular lymphoma
(data set GSE16131-GPL97: p<0.040192), glioma (data
set GSE4412-GPL97: P<0.005900).
According to our analysis and previous reports,
ATP7B is expected to be important position in MDR of
human cancers clinically as well as cisplatin resistance. In
this study, we show that ATP7B confers MDR to cancer
cells, similarly to ATP7A, by facilitating nuclear efflux
and following late endosome drug sequestration.

Wt ATP7B and two mutant ATP7B, Cu0 (deleted
all MBS) and Cu6 (deleted the 1st-5th MBSs, MBS15) plasmids were kindly presented by Drs. Sugiyama
and Terada (Akita University) Cu0 and Cu6 were
constructed as described previously [37]. Another
ATP7B mutant M6C/S, the cysteines of which were
replaced with serines in MBS6, was generated using
site-directed mutagenesis with forward primer: 5′
CCTCTGTCCACAACATAGAGTCCA 3′ and reverse
primer: 5′ AAGCGCTGGTCATCCCTGTGATTG 3′.
These cDNAs were ligated into pRc/CMV (Thermo Fisher
Science, Waltham, MA) and transfected into KB-3-1 cells
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Science) with
G418 selection as described previously [5]. Each single
clone that expresses comparative amounts of ATP7B
protein to that in KB/WD cells was used in the following
analysis.
To produce EGFP-wt ATP7B and EGFP-ATP7B
M6C/S cDNA, BamH1-Xba1 fragments that include
the entire coding region of pRc/CMV-wt ATP7B and
M6C/S cDNA were ligated into the Bgl II and XbaI
sites of pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech, Japan). These
plasmids were transiently transfected into KB-3-1 cells
with Lipofectamine 2000 and observed two days after
transfection.

Preparation of membrane protein
Membrane proteins were prepared as described
previously [5]. Protein concentration was determined by
Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

etoposide, paclitaxel and tamoxifen form Sigma Chemical
Co., (St, Louis, MO), Glutamine, NH4Cl and CuCl2 from
Wako (Osaka, Japan), and HEPES and BCS from Dojindo
(Kumamoto, Japan). SN-38 was obtained by donation
(Daiichi Sankyo Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.).

Membrane fraction protein (100μg) was subjected
to 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.
Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously
[38]. A polyclonal antibody against the HA epitope
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or antiABCC4/MRP4 monoclonal antibody (M4I-10, Monsan,
Netherlands) was used as a primary antibody, while
horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit or antimouse IgG (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, England)
was the secondary antibody respectively. Immunoreactive
bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence
using ECL prime western blotting system (GE
Healthcare).

Cell culture and cells
All cells were cultured in DMEM (Nissui

fetal calf serum (Thermo Scientific, Logan, UT), 10 mM
HEPES (7.5 pH), 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 units/ml
penicillin in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Wild type (wt) ATP7B
expressing cells named KB/WD cells were established by
wt ATP7B transfection to human epidermoid carcinoma,

the cells were allowed to attach overnight. The cells
were exposed for 1 hour to 5 μM doxorubicin at 37°C.
To verify the intracellular localization of doxorubicin,
cells were transfected with GFP-Golgi, RFP-Golgi,
GFP-late endosome, or RFP-late endosome (Cell Light
Reagents BacMam 2.0, Thermo Fisher) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Following 5 μM doxorubicin
exposure for 1 hour, cells were incubated in DMEM
with or without 200 μM BCS, 10 mM NH4Cl, or 10 μM
tamoxifen for 4 hours. All cells were stained with Hoechst
33342 (Thermo Fisher) in PBS (1:2000) for 5 minutes,
washed with PBS three times, and observed using a
confocal laser microscopy (Zeiss LSM700, OberKochen,
Germany).

Cell viability assay
To determine the effects of NH4Cl and tamoxifen
on cell viability, cells were seeded at 2000 cells/well in
96 well plates. After an overnight incubation, cells were
treated with doxorubicin, SN-38 and cisplatin with or
without 10 mM NH4Cl or 10 μM tamoxifen for 24 hours.
The cell viability was determined using the Cell Titer-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit (Promega, Madison,
WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Luminescence was measured using Fluoroskan Ascent FL
(Thermo Fisher).
