ABSTRACT
Tamoxifen is still the most commonly used endocrine therapy drug for estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients and has an excellent outcome, but
tamoxifen resistance remains a great impediment to successful treatment. Recent
studies have prompted an anti-tumor effect of aspirin. Here, we demonstrated
that aspirin not only inhibits the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cell line MCF7, especially when combined with tamoxifen, but also has a potential function to
overcome tamoxifen resistance in MCF-7/TAM. Aspirin combined with tamoxifen can
down regulate cyclinD1 and block cell cycle in G0/G1 phase. Besides, tamoxifen alone
represses c-myc, progesterone receptor (PR) and cyclinD1 in MCF-7 cell line but not
in MCF-7/TAM, while aspirin combined with tamoxifen can inhibit the expression of
these proteins in the resistant cell line. When knocking down c-myc in MCF-7/TAM, cells
become more sensitive to tamoxifen, cell cycle is blocked as well, indicating that aspirin
can regulate c-myc and cyclinD1 proteins to overcome tamoxifen resistance. Our study
discovered a novel role of aspirin based on its anti-tumor effect, and put forward some
kinds of possible mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast cancer cells,
providing a new strategy for the treatment of ER-positive breast carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION

[9–11]. But when there exists drug resistance, tamoxifen
cannot play a role [12]. Generally, cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDKs) involve in the cell cycle phase transitions and also
boost gene transcription in mammals [13]. More literatures
suggest that cyclin-dependent kinases (especially, CDK4
and CDK6) have been identified as the major oncogenic
drivers among CDKs in the cell cycle transitions [14, 15].
Evidence indicates that cyclinD-CDK4/CDK6 axis
has an important role in breast cancer cell survival and
proliferation [14–18]. Aberrant regulation of cyclinD1
leads to tamoxifen resistance, so drugs targeting the axis
can be used in the treatment of breast cancer [17, 19],
which might be also applicable in patients with advanced
breast cancer who are resistant to endocrine treatment.

Approximately 50%–70% of breast cancers are
considered estrogen receptor (ER) positive [1]. Estrogen
signaling plays a central role in ER-positive breast cancer,
which involves in cell proliferation and survival [1, 2].
Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator
(SERM), has been the most widely used endocrine
treatment in ER positive breast cancer patients for more
than 30 years [3, 4]. However, primary or acquired
resistance to tamoxifen results in therapeutic failure,
which needs to be solved in the clinical application [5–8].
Researches show that tamoxifen can block cell cycle
and inhibit cell proliferation in sensitive breast cancer cells

RESULTS

A considerable body of evidence strongly suggests
that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such
as aspirin can reduce the risk of cancers associated with
colon, breast, gastric, prostate, lung, and skin [20–25].
But the exact mechanisms of aspirin that exert its antitumor effect are yet to be elucidated [21, 26]. Studies
have reported that aspirin and its primary metabolite
salicylic acid both have the ability to decrease the mRNA
and protein levels of c-myc in human colon cancer cell
lines, which might be one of the mechanisms for the
antineoplastic activity [27, 28]. Recently, Dachineni et al
[29] have shown that aspirin and salicylic acid can downregulate a number of cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases
(CDKs) in multiple cancer cell lines, which collectively
suggests that inhibitory effect may occur through
down-regulation of these cell cycle regulatory proteins,
providing a novel mechanism for the anti-tumor effect of
aspirin and salicylic.
In our study, we used the ER-positive breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 as the research model, which was
sensitive to the anti-estrogen treatment. At the same time,
tamoxifen resistant cell line MCF-7/TAM was used as the
model to investigate the possible underlying molecular
mechanism of tamoxifen resistance. According to our
studies, there were some genes which may contribute
to the tamoxifen resistance. A few studies have reported
that MYC mRNA and c-myc protein can be inhibited
by salicylates such as aspirin. This in turn reveals the
anti-tumor effect of salicylates on colon cancer cell
lines [27, 28]. So we attempted to use this drug in ERpositive breast cancer and combined it with the SERM
4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT). Interestingly, aspirin not
only had anti-tumor function on the two cell lines MCF-7
and MCF-7/TAM, but also restored the inhibitory effect
of 4-OHT in tamoxifen resistant cell line MCF-7/TAM.
Furthermore, we confirmed aspirin’s anti-tumor function
and potential role in overcoming tamoxifen resistance by
blocking cell cycle. Then we found that aspirin downregulated the tumor related protein cyclinD1, which was
one of the key factors in the cyclinD-CDK4/CDK6 axis
[13]. Aspirin combined with tamoxifen could block cell
cycle in the G0/G1 phase in the two cell lines. Further,
we knocked down the MYC gene and the effect of aspirin
occurred. Our studies have discovered a novel role based
on anti-tumor effect of aspirin, and have put forward a
few possible mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance in ERpositive breast cancer cells, providing a new strategy for
the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer.

Identification of MCF-7 and MCF-7/TAM,
and comparison of the anti-tumor effect of
4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) on the two breast
cancer cell lines
Through comparison with cell databases and
identification of professional institutions, there was no
deterioration caused by other human cells and there was
no cytometaplasias observed in MCF-7 and MCF-7/TAM
cell lines. Cell lines intended to be MCF-7 whose DNA
was typing well.
Estrogen receptor α (ERα), the target of tamoxifen,
is one of the most important biomarkers in MCF-7 cell
line. Results from the immunofluorescent assay showed
that ERα was expressed in every cell of both tamoxifen
sensitive cell line MCF-7 and tamoxifen resistant cell line
MCF-7/TAM, but the fluorescence intensity of MCF-7/
TAM cells was much weaker than that of MCF-7 cells.
Besides compared with MCF-7 cells, the morphology of
MCF-7/TAM cells also changed, cells were smaller and
more compact (Figure 1A).
To examine whether MCF-7 cells were sensitive to
4-OHT while MCF-7/TAM cells were resistant, we treated
two cell lines with several concentrations of 4-OHT
(0–6 μM) for 7 days and measured the cell survival rate
compared with negative control. As shown in Figure 1B,
there was an incremental inhibition effect of proliferation
on MCF-7 cells but not on MCF-7/TAM cells, indicating
that MCF-7/TAM cells were resistant to tamoxifen.
Previous studies suggest that tamoxifen can block
cell cycle and inhibit cell proliferation in sensitive breast
cancer cells [9–11]. Then we tested cell cycle by flow
cytometry and found that the percentage of G0/G1 phase
increased significantly in MCF-7 cells after treated with
4-OHT, but not in MCF-7/TAM cells (Figure 1C and 1D),
which meant that cell cycle would be affected in MCF-7
cells, while in MCF-7/TAM cells there was no significant
change of it.

Aspirin has an obvious anti-tumor effect on both
cell lines and a synergetic effect with tamoxifen
on MCF-7/TAM
We used 4-OHT alone and combination with ASA to
investigate the effect on two cell lines. As shown in Figure 2,
the inhibitory effect of 4-OHT on MCF-7 and MCF-7/
TAM cells was distinct. The survival rate of MCF-7
cells decreased along with the increase of concentrations
of 4-OHT, and there was an additive inhibition observed
when combined with 2 mM ASA (Figure 2A and 2B).
These results suggested that ASA had anti-tumor effect on
MCF-7 cell line.
We found that the survival rate of MCF-7/TAM

cells decreased with the increasing concentrations of
4-OHT when combined with 2 mM ASA, while no
such phenomenon was observed when using 4-OHT
alone (Figure 2C). Also we figured out that at the same
concentration of 4-OHT, there was difference of MCF-7/
TAM cells survival rate between using 4-OHT alone and
combined with 2 mM ASA. Meanwhile the difference
significantly rose with the increase of concentrations of
4-OHT (Figure 2D), suggesting that ASA had an additional
function to enhance the anti-tumor effect of tamoxifen on
MCF-7/TAM cells. We deduced that ASA could not only
have anti-tumor effect on ER-positive breast cancer cell
lines, but also overcome tamoxifen resistance.

As shown above, 4-OHT could block cell cycle in
MCF-7 cells but not in MCF-7/TAM cells. We wondered
whether there also existed changes of cell cycle in two cell
lines when combining 4-OHT with 2 mM ASA. Then we
tested by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 3A and 3B,
compared with negative control, the percentage of G0/G1
phase increased in the 4-OHT group and combination
group in MCF-7 cell line, especially in the combination
group, suggesting that cell cycle changed in different
extent after treatment.
In MCF-7/TAM cell line, there was nearly no

change of cell cycle among 4-OHT group, ASA group
and negative control, but the percentage of G0/G1 phase
increased evidently in the combination group (Figure 3C
and 3D), which showed that more cells were arrested in
G0/G1 phase when combining 4-OHT with ASA than
using 4-OHT alone or ASA alone. Thus, we concluded
that aspirin could enhance the cell-killing effect of 4-OHT
through cell cycle arrest both in MCF-7 and MCF-7/
TAM cell line. This might be a comparatively important
mechanism of how ASA reverse 4-OHT resistance.

By the gene microarray, we found that there were
lots of differences of the expression of genes between
MCF-7 and MCF-7/TAM cell lines. Through screening
and analyzing relevant websites and database online,
and with the help of previous literature [7, 12, 27, 28],
we thought that there were some genes which might
contribute to the phenomena of tamoxifen resistance.

7-day treatment, with the increasing concentrations of 4-OHT (0 μM, 3 μM and 6 μM), the survival rate of MCF-7 cells decreased and there

alone (p > 0.05). (D) The difference of survival rate between combined drug group and negative control (4-OHT alone) was observed at

For example, ERα protein is the target of tamoxifen, the
transcription of PGR is dependent on the ERα activating
estrogen response element (ERE) and also code PR
protein, while its level can reflect the function of ERα.
Cyclin D1 protein can be regulated by ERα, and coded by
CCND1 gene, which is one of the key factors in cyclinDCDK4/CDK6 axis and have effect on cell cycle [30].
C-myc, coded by MYC gene, performs multiple cellular
functions such as cell proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis,
growth, and differentiation [31, 32].
As shown in Figure 4A, we found that there were

differences between MCF-7 and MCF-7/TAM cell lines.
The transcription of PGR had a lower expression level
in MCF-7/TAM cell line. The transcription of CCND1
gene showed no significant difference between MCF-7
and MCF-7/TAM cell lines. The expression of oncogene
MYC was much higher in tamoxifen resistant cell line,
and it might contribute to the unlimited proliferation
of cancer cells. When treated with 4-OHT alone, there
were differences among CCND1, MYC and PGR gene
expression in MCF-7 and MCF-7/TAM cell lines. In
MCF-7 cells, 4-OHT could down-regulate CCND1,

PGR and MYC significantly, while there was no such
function observed in MCF-7/TAM cell line. However,
when combined 4-OHT with ASA, these genes could be
down-regulated in MCF-7/TAM cells as well (Figure 4B
and 4C). These changes of gene expression might reveal
the sensitization mechanism of ASA.

complex can affect on cell cycle, which can take cell
cycle from G0/G1 phase to S phase [16]. As shown
in Figure 5, normally cyclinD1 protein level could be
down-regulated by tamoxifen binding to ERα in MCF7 cells. However, in MCF-7/TAM cell line, cyclinD1
protein level cannot be down-regulated by tamoxifen
binding to ERα anymore. When combined ASA with
4-OHT, the inhibitory effect on cyclinD1 showed an
emergence again in MCF-7/TAM cells, which enhanced
by the increasing concentrations of 4-OHT. The results
showed that 4-OHT could repress cyclinD1 protein
levels in MCF-7 cells but not in MCF-7/TAM cells.
Combination of ASA and 4-OHT could inhibit CDK4’s
expression in two cell lines but not CDK6, and the
inhibitory effect enhanced along with the increasing
concentrations of 4-OHT. This indicated that ASA

DISCUSSION

cycle changed as well, suggesting that cells became more
sensitive to tamoxifen after knocking-down the MYC.
Further, this indicated that MYC gene and c-myc protein
might be one of the targets of aspirin and play important
roles in overcoming tamoxifen resistance.

Although aspirin treatment in tumor inhibition has
been reported in recent years in clinical and laboratory
researches [20–22, 24–26, 33], the exact molecular
mechanisms are still unclear. In our study, we took ERpositive breast cancer cell lines as the research object

and assessed the anti-tumor effects of aspirin on MCF-7
and MCF-7/TAM cell lines, which were sensitive and
resistant to tamoxifen respectively. We found that aspirin
did have an impact on ER-positive breast cancer cells’
proliferation and inhibited the process of cell cycle. Even
more important, we observed the role of aspirin in partly
reversing the function of tamoxifen in MCF-7/TAM cells,
so we further explored the molecular mechanisms of this
phenomenon, which might reflect the cause of tamoxifen
resistance in ER-positive breast cancer cells.
The anti-inflammatory dose of aspirin varies
from 0.5 to 2.5 mM [34], so we choose 2 mM as the
concentration of ASA which is not non-specific cytotoxic,
and can be used as a therapeutic dose. Aspirin inhibited the
expression of c-myc protein in our study. C-myc protein
levels are tightly regulated via ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway in the normal cells [35–37]. But in many cancers,
including breast, lung, colon and prostate cancer, c-myc
is overexpressed and activated frequently [38, 39].
As a transcription factor, c-myc binds with nuclear
DNA, controls nearly 15% of the expression of global
genes, and performs multiple cellular functions such as
cell proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, growth, and
differentiation [31, 32]. Hence, c-myc is considered as an
ideal target for cancer treatment [40–42]. In this paper,
compared with tamoxifen sensitive cell line MCF-7,
the gene expression of MYC showed a higher level in
tamoxifen resistant cell line MCF-7/TAM, and a higher
level of c-myc protein was also observed. Since the
function of c-myc had similarities with estrogen receptor,
and the expression of MYC had a higher level in MCF-7/
TAM cells, we supposed that the role of ERα was replaced
by c-myc partially or totally. Because of this, the function
of tamoxifen inhibiting cell proliferation by targeting
ERα disappeared. Aspirin could down-regulate the c-myc
protein level, and then the functions of ERα regained.
Meanwhile cell proliferation and cell cycle were relied on
ERα binding with estradiol again. In tamoxifen resistant
cell line MCF-7/TAM, through knocking down the gene
expression of MYC and suppressing the protein level of
c-myc, cell proliferation and cell cycle were affected,
further prompting our conclusion to be reliable.
CyclinD-CDK4/CDK6 axis has an important role
in the survival and proliferation of cancer cells, which
mainly takes effect through regulating the cell cycle [43].
Drugs that target this axis can be used in the treatment
of cancers especially breast cancer [17, 18, 44, 45]. In
tamoxifen sensitive breast cancer cell line MCF-7, 4-OHT
alone could down-regulate the protein level of cyclinD1,
while there was no such effect observed in tamoxifen
resistant cell line MCF-7/TAM. When 4-OHT was
combined with ASA, a more significant inhibitory effect
of cyclinD1 protein occurred in MCF-7 cells. Besides,
the cyclinD1 protein level was down-regulated in MCF7/TAM cells at the same time. The inhibitory effect also
enhanced along with the increasing concentrations of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

4-OHT, which might be one of the mechanisms of aspirin
to overcome the MCF-7/TAM cells’ tamoxifen resistance.
Furthermore, with the recent introductions of CDK4/6
inhibitors for treatment of ER-positive advanced breast
cancer [46, 47], but with the potentially unpredictable
toxicity, the combined use of tamoxifen and aspirin offers
a much simpler treatment. Of course, clinical trials will be
need to confirm the observations reported in our studies.
In tamoxifen resistant ER-positive breast cancer cell
line, aspirin might also inhibit the upstream regulators
of c-myc and cyclinD1 proteins, such as the mTOR
signaling [36, 48], wnt/β-catenin [49, 50] and NF-κB
pathways [51, 52]. These proteins and factors could upregulate c-myc and cyclinD1 protein levels excessively,
and these effects which were necessary for the survival of
cancer cells did not depend on estradiol binding to ERα.
When tamoxifen was combined with aspirin, almost all
the growth signals were blocked off, and the functions
of tamoxifen were regained, which reflected an effect of
overcoming tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast
cancer. Diagramatic representation of this has been shown
in Figure 7. Since several large reviews were published
in the latest years about tamoxifen resistance but none
has mentioned aspirin or/and the pathways (c-myc and
cyclins), our findings are indeed unique. Next, we are
going to explore more features about c-myc protein and its
regulatory mechanisms. Besides, the relationship between
c-myc and cyclinD1 should also be investigated.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that
the function of aspirin inhibiting the cell cycle and
proliferation of MCF-7 and MCF-7/TAM cell lines is
involved in cyclin D1, c-myc and PR proteins. What’s
more important is that aspirin also has a potential role in
overcoming tamoxifen resistance, which in turn provides a
novel therapeutic strategy for ER-positive advanced breast
carcinoma.

Briefly, cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density
of 2 × 105 cells /well, followed by overnight incubation.
Cells were then treated with 4-OHT at a concentration of

72 hours’ treatment, nucleus was stained by Propidium
Iodide (PI) and cell cycle was examined by flow cytometry
(Beckman, USA) according to the kit’s manufacturer’s

was under 3%. Final concentrations of 4-OHT were
1–6 μM, and final concentration of ASA was 2 mM.

Immunofluorescent assay

Cell growth inhibition assay

Cells were plated on the glass slides. After 48
hours, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, then treated with 0.1% Triton X-100.
Unspecific antigens were blocked by goat serum at room
temperature and primary antibodies were incubated
overnight at 4°C. The CY3-secondary antibodies (Abcam,
USA) were incubated and FITC-phalloidin solution was used
bind F-actin. Cell nucleus was stained by DAPI working
solution. Finally, cells were photographed using LSM 510
META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).

The growth inhibitory effects were measured by
using a colorimetric MTS assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich).
Briefly, MCF-7 and MCF-7/TAM cells were plated in
96-well plates at a density of 1 × 103 cell/well, followed
by an overnight incubation. Cells were then treated with
increasing concentrations of 4-OHT (0–6 μM) individually
or by combining with 2 mM ASA. After 7-day treatments,
viable cells were quantified with MTS substrate according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. 450nm wave length OD
values were examined by an enzyme-labeled instrument
(Bio-Rad, USA). Cell viability rates were expressed as
percentage of corresponding control.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay
Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol
reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), and cDNA was synthesized
from total RNA using a Reverse Transcript Kit
(Promega, USA). Relative quantitation of mRNA
expression was achieved using real-time PCR (CFX

Cell cycle assay
The experiment was performed by using a cell cycle
analysis kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, shanghai, China).

Figure 7: Diagramatic representation of the possible related molecular mechanism of MCF-7/TAM. In the resistant
cell line MCF-7/TAM, other mitogens or pathways take place E2-ER complexes’ function, so tamoxifen resistance occur. Aspirin has an
effect on inhibiting c-myc and cyclin D1’s expression or their upstream regulators’ activity, and partly restores the function of tamoxifen,
prompting a potential role in overcoming tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive advanced breast carcinoma.

Western blot analysis
After treatment with drugs, whole-cell lysates
(20μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and then
proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Pall
Corporation, Life Sciences). Membranes were blocked by
3% BSA and probed with antibodies. The quantification
of protein level was performed by densitometric scanning
(Tanon-5500, Shanghai, China) and then was normalized
to intensity with GAPDH. The results of Western blotting
were analyzed by ImageJ software. Antibodies for Western
blot were as follows: rabbit c-myc and rabbit PR primary
antibodies were purchased from Abcam (USA) at 1:1000
dilution in 5% BSA. Rabbit cyclinD1, rabbit GAPDH
primary antibodies and mouse anti-rabbit HRP antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (USA) at
1:2000 dilution in 5% BSA.
