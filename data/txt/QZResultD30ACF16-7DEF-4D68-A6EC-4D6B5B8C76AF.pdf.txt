Abstract:
Myelodysplastic syndromes are characterized by a high risk of evolution into
acute myeloid leukaemia which can involve activation of signalling pathways. As
the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has a key role in signal transduction,
we investigated its role in the pathogenesis and evolution of myelodysplastic
syndromes. Expressions of HSP90 and signalling proteins clients (phosphorylatedAKT (pAKT), Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated-FAK (pFAK)), were
assessed in bone marrow mononuclear and CD34-positive (CD34+) cells from 177
patients with myelodysplasia. Effects of HSP90 inhibition were also evaluated in
39 samples. The levels of all proteins studied were significantly higher in patients
with high grade disease, than those with low grade myelodysplastic syndrome or
chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. High levels of HSP90, FAK, pFAK and pAKT
were associated with shorter survival and increased risk of progression into acute
leukaemia. A down regulation of pFAK and pAKT and increased apoptosis was
observed in mononuclear and CD34+ cells after 12 hours of incubation with 17-AAG.
In conclusion, our data suggest the implication of HSP90 and FAK and AKT activation
in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes with excess of blasts and evolution
to leukaemia. Moreover this signalling network could be a therapeutic target through
HSP90 inhibition.

INTRODUCTION

microenvironment is also implicated in the pathogenesis
through the secretion of proapoptotic cytokines (Fas and
Trail) [7,8]. Increased apoptosis is observed in all forms
of MDS, but is higher in patients with better prognosis and
comparatively lower in patients with an excess of blasts
[5,6].
Apoptosis is a tightly regulated phenomenon,
and caspase activation is controlled by the bcl-2-family
proteins. Indeed we showed that the apoptotic disorder
was associated with an imbalance between proteins of
the bcl-2 family, with an upregulation of anti-apoptotic
proteins bcl-2 and bcl-XL in the forms with excess of

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a
heterogeneous group of diseases with regard to initial
presentation and evolution [1]. Patients with MDS usually
present with one or several peripheral cytopenias despite a
normo- or hypercellular bone marrow (BM). This apparent
paradox has been linked to an excessive intramedullary
apoptosis [2-4], but mechanisms underlying this
phenomenon are not fully understood yet. We and
others have demonstrated that apoptosis results from the
activation of caspases, particularly caspase 3 [5,6]. The

[13]. Furthermore, HSP90 exists mainly in the activated
(complexed) form in cancer cells, whereas in non
malignant cells only a small part of HSP90 is activated
[14].
More limited data are available regarding the
expression of HSP90 in haematological malignancies and
particularly in acute leukaemia and MDS: high expression
of HSP90 protein and HSP90α RNA has been reported
by Yufu et al in leukemic cell lines and a small series
of acute leukaemia patients [15]. We reported on the
expression of HSP90 in a larger series of patients with
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) [16]. Higher HSP90
levels, as assessed by flow cytometry, were associated
with a poor prognosis and higher expression of activated
signal transduction proteins: phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K), phospho serine-threonine protein kinase AKT
(also known as protein kinase B) and extracellular signalregulated kinases (ERK). Other reports show that HSP90
is necessary for the maintenance of oncoproteins such as
bcr-abl [17], mutated c-kit [18], and flt3 [19,20].
HSP90 activation and functional properties
necessitate the binding of ATP to a specific pocket. The

blasts [9]. More recently the role of Heat Shock Proteins
(HSP) in cell protection and apoptosis regulation has
been demonstrated. HSP are a group of highly conserved
proteins, which act as molecular chaperones in order to
ensure the proper folding of synthesized proteins, or their
refolding under denaturating conditions [10]. They also
play a role in protein degradation via the proteasome
machinery. A member of the HSP family, HSP90, is
abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm of most human
cells. HSP90 exists in two main isoforms: HSP90α,
inducible, and HSP90β, constitutive [11]. It exerts its role
by forming a multiprotein complex with high ATPase
activity, in cooperation with cochaperones, including
HSP70 [12]. HSP90 clients are implicated in cell cycling,
receptor function, signal transduction and apoptosis.
High levels of HSP90α protein or HSP90 mRNA have
been reported in many types of cancer cells, such as
pancreatic carcinomas, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung

benzoquinone ansamycins herbimycin A and geldanamycin
are potent inhibitors of HSP90, binding tightly to the ATP
pocket and preventing the formation of an active HSP90
complex [21]. The less toxic geldanamycin-derivative
17-allylamino-demethoxy geldanamycin (17-AAG)
presents a much higher (up to 100-fold) affinity for HSP90
complexes than for uncomplexed HSP90, which confers
to this drug a highly specific anti-tumoral activity [22].
17-AAG (Tanespimycin) and other HSP90 inhibitors
are now considered as targeted therapy for cancer, as
they show promise in early clinical trials [23,24]. In a
preliminary study, we have shown that HSP27, 70 and 90
are over-expressed in advanced MDS as compared to early
MDS and normal BM [25]. This suggests their possible
implication in MDS pathogenesis and evolution. Here
we report on the clinical and biological significance of
HSP90 expression in a series of 177 patients with MDS.
We evaluated the expression of HSP90 and of relevant
client proteins (pAKT), implicated in cell survival and
autonomous growth, and phospho-focal adhesion kinase
(pFAK), implicated in tissue invasion and metastasis, at

diagnosis and in some cases after evolution to a higher
grade MDS or to overt AML. The use of multicolour
flow cytometry allowed us to specifically study subsets of
cells (ie CD34+ cells). We show that HSP90 and FAK are
overexpressed in high risk cases, and that CD34+ cells are
highly sensitive to the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG.

RESULTS
Expression of HSP90, FAK, pFAK and pAKT
Expression of HSP90 was weak in normal bone
marrow MNC (MFIR: 7.8 ± 2.3, n= 6). We also observed a
low expression of FAK and pFAK (MFIR : 4.2 ± 0.8 ; 6.8
± 0.8 respectively), whereas pAKT was not detected above
control level. Results were similar in normal CD34+ cells
for all the proteins studied.
In MDS/CMML MNC, HSP90 and other proteins
levels were significantly higher in high-risk cases
according to WHO classification (p<10-4, Figure 1, mean

Predictive value

obtained when considering the percentage of positive cells
instead of the MFIR (data not presented).
Although these proteins were not detected only in
the “blast” gate (CD45/SSC low) of MNC, we observed
a weak linear correlation between the percentage of
blasts (as assessed by cytology or by cytometry) and the
expression of HSP90, pAKT, FAK and pFAK in MNC
(r2=0.62 to 0.71).
These proteins were also expressed at significantly
higher levels in CD34+ cells than in CD34-negative MNC
(p<10-4 for all proteins). We therefore compared the level
of expression in CD34+ cells in the different sub-types
of MDS and in CMML. Again, we observed a higher
expression of HSP90 (mean MFIR ± SD: 62 ± 22 versus
5 ± 6 and 25 ± 24), pAKT (51 ± 22 versus 4 ± 5 and 17 ±
22), FAK (37 ± 13 versus 4 ± 4 and 17 ± 21) and pFAK
(69 ± 20 versus 4 ± 6 and 22 ± 27) in RAEB (n=93) than
in RA (n=61), and CMML (n=23) respectively, CMML
exhibiting intermediate levels (Figure 1). This shows that
the differences regarding expression in MNC were not
only due to the higher percentage of blasts or CD34+ cells
in high-risk cases.
Finally, there were also significant differences
related to cytogenetic category (overall p level <10-4,
figure 2). Specifically, HSP90 (p<0.001), FAK (p<0.05),
and pFAK (p<0.01) expression in MNC was lower in
good prognosis than in intermediate/poor prognosis forms.
pFAK levels were more elevated in poor prognosis than in
intermediate forms (p<0.05). The same differences were
observed in CD34+ cells, but in addition, pAKT levels
were lower in good versus intermediate or poor prognosis
groups (p<10-4). 5q- cases expressed similar levels to other
good prognosis cases.

Because of the correlation with other relevant
clinical factors such as cytogenetic and percentage of
blasts, we studied the prognostic value of HSP90, pAKT,
FAK and pFAK expression. For univariate analysis,
patients were arbitrarily placed into two categories: high
level (MFIR equal to or above median value) or low level
(MFIR below median value). Survival duration and time
to transformation into overt leukaemia were significantly
shorter in patients with high expression of HSP90, pAKT,
pFAK and FAK (Figure 3). For all those intracellular
proteins, the percentage of positive cells was significantly
higher in the groups with increasingly poor prognosis as
defined by the international prognostic scoring system
IPSS (p<10-4, Table 2). In multivariate analysis, we studied
the effects of known parameters such as age, cytogenetic
(or IPSS), percentage of blasts and marker expression.
Only cytogenetics (or IPSS), percentage of blasts and
percentage of CD34+ cells remained independent
prognostic factors.

Transformation into AML
Transformation occurred in 87 cases in total, after
a mean delay of 386 days. Nineteen cases could be
reevaluated at the time of transformation. This included
9 cases with a diagnosis of RA and 10 RAEB. The blast
percentage was 6.5% (±5.9) at diagnosis and 42% (±16)
after transformation.
As presented in Figure 4, the levels of HSP90,
FAK, pFAK and pAKT were significantly higher after
transformation than at diagnosis. This was the case in
MNC (p<10-4) and more interestingly in CD34+ cells
(p<10-4).

Inhibition of HSP90

technique was used as for uncultured cells. In addition,
we also assessed the expression of HSP70, which has
been reported to be upregulated in the presence of HSP90
inhibitors. The levels of HSP90, FAK, pFAK and pAKT
were significantly decreased in the presence of 2 and 5 µM
of 17-AAG. This effect was more evident in CD34+ cells
than in MNC. By contrast, expression of HSP70 was not
significantly modified in both cell types (Figure 5).

The effects of inhibition of HSP90 were studied by
exposing MNC to 17-AAG for up to 24 hours. Thirty-nine
cases of RAEB expressing high levels of HSP90 were
studied. In the presence of 2 µM 17-AAG, the percentages
of viable cells at 12 and 24 hours were respectively 60%
and 32% compared to 100% for the control without 17AAG. At a concentration of 5 µM, the percentage of viable
cells was 38% at 12 hours, and no viable cell could be
recovered at 24 hours (Figure 5).
17-AAG significantly increased the percentage
of apoptotic cells, as assessed by activated caspase-3
expression and annexin V binding. After 12 hours of
exposure to 5 µM 17-AAG, more than 90% of cells were
apoptotic (Figure 5). In clonogeneic assays, the yield of
colonies was heterogeneous in the absence of 17-AAG
(mean number ± SD of CFU-GM, clusters and BFU-E:
60 ± 80,  139 ±  136, and 19 ± 14, respectively). At a
concentration of 5 µM, 17-AAG completely inhibited the
growth of all types of colonies in semi-solid medium (data
not shown).
The effects of 17-AAG on protein expression was
studied after 12 hours of culture. The same staining

DISCUSSION
In this paper, we show that high expression of
HSP90 is associated with increasingly advanced disease
and poor clinical prognosis. As expected, this was
significantly correlated with other known prognostic
features such as cytogenetics and blast percentage which
appear to be of importance in multivariate analysis.
One interesting point is the fact that CD34+ cells from
advanced cases also expressed the higher levels, when
compared to CD34+ cells of good prognosis cases
or normal marrows. This implies that progression to
advanced disease is associated with a distinct transduction
pathways profile at the CD34+ progenitor level, where
an imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis has
already been described.6 In line with this observation,
we also show that when patients could be retested at the
time of transformation into overt leukemia, the expression
of HSP90 and signaling molecules was significantly
increased. This is also consistent with the known
overexpression of HSP90 in acute myeloid leukemia [15,
16].
We also studied the expression of the activated
forms of known clients of HSP90, pAKT and pFAK.
These proteins are implicated in signal transduction and
their constitutive activation is a hallmark of transformation
in many cancer models. Again a higher expression was
observed in MNC and in CD34+ cells of MDS with poor
prognosis or adverse cytogenetics. Indeed high expression
of HSP, FAK and pAKT was associated with higher risk
of transformation and poor survival. High levels of HSP
and FAK are predictive of resistance to chemotherapy in
AML, as shown by our group and others [16, 30]. The data
regarding the prognostic significance of pAKT activation
in AML cells is more controversial. While we and others
have observed a correlation with poor prognosis [16, 29],
Tamburini et al showed that pAKT expression as detected
by flow cytometry implied a better prognosis, observed
independently of cytogenetics, although pAKT was higher
in core binding factor (CBF) and intermediate cases [31].
These discrepancies may be the consequence of different
technical approaches, but mainly due to the fact that
different sites of phosphorylation were assessed in these
studies. Again, we show that levels in CD34+ cells were
higher at time of evolution to AML than at diagnosis,
irrespective of the initial classification of MDS. Taken
together, these findings favor a role for these proteins in

disease initial type and in the pathogenesis of evolution
into overt AML.
The second point raised in our study is the
possibility to target in vitro HSP90. HSP90 inhibitors
such as geldanamycin, 17-AAG or 17-DMAG have
anti-tumoral activity by inhibiting proliferation and
inducing apoptosis [32, 33]. In leukemia cells, 17-AAG
alone or in combination with chemotherapy inhibits
cell growth and induces apoptosis [34]. Moreover,
in specific leukemia subtypes characterized by the
presence of mutations or rearrangements of genes such
as FLT-3 or BCR-ABL resulting in high expression of
constitutively activated oncoproteins, the association of
HSP90 inhibitors and targeted drugs is highly effective in
vitro [35, 36]. Although the exact mechanism by which
HSP90 inhibitors interfere with leukaemia cell survival
is not fully understood, we have also demonstrated that
17-AAG was able to induce apoptosis in primary AML
cells, in correlation with HSP90 and activated AKT levels
[16]. In MDS, we show that 17-AAG readily inhibits
CD34+ and MNC survival in liquid culture, at least in
samples from high grade MDS. Short-term exposure to

17-AAG also down regulates pAKT and pFAK levels.
This is consistent with the mechanism of 17-AAGinduced apoptosis suggested by Nimmanapalli et al, which
implicates a modulation of apoptotic proteins of the bcl-2
family downstream of AKT, Raf-1 and Src pathways [37].
FAK is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase localized
to regions called focal adhesions. Many stimuli can
induce activation of FAK, including integrins and growth
factors. The major site of autophosphorylation, tyrosine
397, is a docking site for the SH2 domains of Src family
proteins. Phosphorylated FAK binds and activates proteins
forming the FAK complex, and facilitates the generation
of downstream signals necessary to regulate cell functions
like motility, survival and proliferation. Dysregulation of
FAK could participate in the development of cancer, and
abnormal activation of FAK has been described in AML
[29]. Our data suggest that FAK, as a client of HSP90,
could be indirectly targeted by HSP90 inhibition.
Finally, although the HSP90 inhibitor alvespimycin
proved to be toxic in patients with AML involved in a
phase I study, other therapeutic strategies using HSP90
inhibitors may be possible, specially with new inhibitors

Figure 5: Effects of HSP90 inhibition with 17-AAG. The viability of bone marrow MNC from RAEB patients (n=39) was studied
after exposure to 2µM or 5µM of 17-AAG for 12 to 24 hours (top left). Apoptosis of the cells was assessed by activated caspase-3
expression and annexin V binding after exposure to 2µM or 5µM of 17-AAG for 24 hours and 12 hours respectively (bottom left). The
levels of HSP90, HSP70, pAKT, FAK and pFAK expression was evaluated in MNC (top right) and CD34+ cells (bottom right) after
exposure to 2µM or 5µM of 17-AAG for 12 hours.

Cultures

like NVP-AUY922, which seems to be less toxic than
ansamycine derivaties [38, 39]. Epigenetic therapies
are increasingly used in MDS. The histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors show a clinical activity in high-grade
MDS. Acetylation of HSP90 by exposure to HDAC-6
inhibitors results in an inhibition of its chaperone function
[40]. The combination of an inhibitor of HDAC and 17AAG is highly active in vitro against cells from chronic
myeloid leukemia in blast crisis and AML cells harboring
a FLT-3 mutation [41]. HDAC-6 inhibitors, alone or in
combination with another HSP90 inhibitor, may therefore
represent a potential targeted therapy of high risk MDS
with possible dual mechanism of action. Recent preclinical
studies have tested bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in
MDS, but with limited effects [42]. Adjunction of revlimid
to bortezomib seems of interest, but recent data showed
that efficacity of bortezomib may be enhanced by HSP90
inhibition, thought induction of protein misfolding. It will
be of interest to test this combination in MDS [43].
In conclusion, assessment of the level of HSP90
expression could be predictive of patient response and
allow the selection of patients for which HSP90 inhibition
would be most promising.

Short-term liquid cultures
17-AAG was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
diluted in DMSO and stored at –20°C before use. Nonadherent MNC and CD34+ cells were incubated in
RPMI1640 at 37°C in fully humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2 in the presence of different concentrations of 17
AAG (2µM or 5µM), or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) alone
for controls, for 24 hours. After these treatments, cells
were washed in PBS and viable cells were enumerated
using a trypan blue exclusion test.
All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Clonogenic assays
Normal and MDS/CMML MNC were incubated in
triplicate in methylcellulose and growth factor-containing
culture medium (STEMα.ID, STEMα, Saint-Clémentles-Places, France). In some experiments, cultures were
performed in the presence of 17-AAG (or DMSO alone
for controls) which was added into the culture medium
to obtain the appropriate final concentration (2µM or
5µM). CFU-GM and BFU-E were scored after 14 days
of incubation.

DESIGN AND METHODS

Antigen expression and flow cytometry

Patients

The samples were surface-stained with CD45PECy5 (clone J33, Beckman-Coulter France, Villepinte,
France) and CD34-FITC (clone 8G12, BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA) antibodies for 15 minutes at room
temperature. Then, the cells were washed and fixed with
3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 minutes. The
staining of intracellular proteins was performed after
permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X100 (Sigma-Aldrich)
during 15 minutes at room temperature. The specific
antibodies used for this study were: HSP90-phycoerytrin
(PE)-conjugated (clone F8 SCL3-119 which recognizes
both HSP90 alpha and beta isoforms, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), FAK-PE (clone H-1,
Santa Cruz), pFAK-PE (clone K73-480, BD Biosciences),
pAKTS473-alexafluor (AF647)-conjugated (clone M-8961, BD Biosciences), and AKTS473-AF647 (clone
55PKBa/Akt, BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated for
1 hour at room temperature, washed and re-suspended in
PBS before analysis. The isotype controls used for the
phospho-proteins were matched to the primary antibodies
at identical concentrations [28]. Cell populations were
gated according to CD45/side scatter (SSC) analysis.
Flow cytometry analysis was performed with
a Becton-Dickinson FACS Canto II, using the DIVA
software. At least 100000 events were analyzed. Results
were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity ratios
(MFIR) (ratio of stained sample/isotype control).

One hundred and seventy-seven patients with MDS
(n=154) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML,
n=23) at diagnosis were included in this study between
January 2006 and October 2010. All patients gave an
informed consent. Diagnosis was carried out according to
WHO recommendations and confirmed by two separate
observers [26]. As we included CMML cases, the FAB
classification was also used to distinguish sub-groups [27].
Cytogenetic analysis was available for 152 cases. Detailed
clinical and biological characteristics are given in Table 1.

MDS/CMML and control cells
Cells were collected by bone marrow aspiration
into heparin-containing vials. Mononuclear cells (MNC)
were separated on a Ficoll gradient (Eurobio, Les Ulis,
France), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), resuspended in
RPMI 1640 (Eurobio) and incubated for two hours at
37°C on sterile plastic dishes. Non-adherent cells were
then recovered, washed twice in PBS and immediately
processed for further studies.
As controls, normal marrow cells were harvested
from 6 healthy bone marrow donors and processed
identically.

Apoptosis

Correlations were performed using a Spearman rank
correlation test.
Survival curves were plotted according to the
Kaplan-Meir method. Survival duration of different groups
was compared by the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis
of survival was performed using a Cox regression model.
Statistical tests were computed by the IBM SPSS
statistical software and data plots were performed using
the Prim5 software.

Annexin V staining
Untreated and drug-treated cells were incubated
with Annexin-V fluorescein and propidium iodide (PI)
in HEPES buffer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). After
incubation for 15 minutes in the dark, cells were analyzed
by flow cytometry. Live cells were determined by PI
exclusion. Early apoptotic fraction was determined by
annexin-V-positive and PI-negative staining.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Activated caspase-3 expression

This research was funded by the “Association Les
Amis de Rémi” and “Ligue Départementale contre le
Cancer de la Loire” (France).

Cytospins were also used to study the caspase-3
activation by Alkaline Phosphatase-Anti Alkaline
Phosphatase-(APAAP) technique. We used an
amplification combination of alkaline phosphatase (AP)
and avidin-biotinyled enzyme complex (ABC) technique
(Vectastain Universal mouse and rabbit kit, Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cytospins were fixed for
90 seconds with acetone at room temperature. They were
rehydrated in PBS for 5 minutes. Non-specific binding
was blocked with horse serum during 20 minutes. Then
slides were incubated for 30 minutes with polyclonal
rabbit anti active caspase-3 clone (Cell Signaling, Beverly,
MA), washed twice in PBS for 5 minutes and incubated
with biotinyled horse anti-mouse or rabbit secondary
antibody for 30 minutes, rinsed again for 5 minutes in
PBS, and reincubated for 30 minutes with biotinyled
alkaline phosphatase complex (ABC reagent). After an
additional wash in PBS, slides were incubated with an
appropriate enzyme substrate solution (Fast red) until
optimal red granular reaction (20-30 minutes). Slides were
rinsed respectively with PBS and distilled water before
a counterstain nuclear step consisting of an incubation
for 7 minutes with Meyer’s Haematoxylin (Dako). After
washing in distilled water, PBS, and distilled water again,
slides were finally mounted in Fluorotech aqueous media
(Valbiotech, Paris, France). Controls were performed by
replacing the primary rabbit antibody by an irrelevant
antibody of the same isotype. Slides were examined
using X10 magnification by two observers. Cells were
considered stained if any diffuse reddish cytoplasmic
staining could be identified. A scale of three levels of red
staining was used to assess intensity of staining: 0 for no
staining, 1 for weak staining, 2 for strong staining and 3
for very strong staining. The percentage of positive cells
(strong or very strong staining) was determined after
counting 100 cells.
