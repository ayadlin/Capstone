Abstract
Obesity is a pandemic and major risk factor for cancers. The reduction of obesity would have been an effective
strategy for cancer prevention, but the reality is that worldwide obesity has kept increasing for decades, remaining
a major avoidable cancer risk secondary only to smoke. The present studies suggest that vitamin D may be an
effective agent to reduce obesity-associated cancer risks in women. Molecular analyses showed that leptin
increased human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA expression and cell growth through estrogen
receptor-a (ERa) activation in ovarian cancer cells, which was suppressed by 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25
(OH)2D3]. The suppression was compromised when miR-498 induction by the hormone was depleted with
microRNA (miRNA) sponges. In mice, high-fat diet (HFD) stimulation of ovarian tumor growth was remarkably
suppressed by 1,25(OH)2D3 analogue EB1089, which was also compromised by miR-498 sponges. EB1089 did not
alter HFD-induced increase in serum leptin levels but increased miR-498 and decreased the diet-induced hTERT
expression in tumors. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed an inverse correlation between hTERT mRNA and
miR-498 in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 in estrogen-sensitive ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancers. The studies
suggest that miR-498-mediated hTERT downregulation is a key event mediating the anti-leptin activity of 1,25
(OH)2D3 in estrogen-sensitive tumors in women. Cancer Res; 74(21); 6194–204. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Obesity is a major health problem in the United States and
around the world, exceeding 30% in America in most gender
and age groups. Its prevalence remained steady in the past
decade, and in 2009–2010, the rate was estimated to be 35.5%
and 35.8% among adult men and women, respectively. Besides
well-known metabolic and cardiovascular complications, obesity has been associated with increased incidence and mortality rates of various cancers and difﬁculties in treatments.
About 20% of all cancers are estimated to be caused by excess
body weight with obesity accounting for about 20% of cancer
death in women and 14% in men, which is second only to
smoking for the number of avoidable cancers (1). Agents
capable of mitigating obesity-associated cancer risk will have

a great potential to improve the outcomes of cancer
intervention.
Among the complex biologic mechanisms linking obesity to
cancer susceptibility, multiple lines of evidences support a
connection between increased production of leptin and obesity-associated cancers, particularly estrogen-sensitive ones in
postmenopausal women. Circulating levels of leptin, an adipocyte-derived adipokine that classically plays a crucial role in
regulating appetite and energy balance, are strongly correlated
with body fat content and markedly elevated in obese individuals (2, 3) as well as in patients with breast, ovarian, and
endometrial cancer (4, 5). The Women's Health Initiative
studies have identiﬁed obesity as a major breast cancer risk
factor for postmenopausal women who had never taken hormone replacement therapy (6). The Million Women Study has
estimated that approximately half of endometrial cancers in
postmenopausal women can be attributed to obesity (7).
Similarly, some studies have suggested an association between
obesity and the risk of ovarian cancer (8, 9). In laboratory
studies, leptin is capable of promoting an aggressive cancer
phenotype by stimulating growth, migration, invasion, and
angiogenesis (8, 9). Particularly relevant to estrogen-sensitive
cancers, leptin has been shown to amplify estrogen signaling by
either increasing aromatase expression in stromal and cancer
cells (10, 11) or by activating estrogen receptor-a (ERa)
through ERK and STAT3 signaling pathways (12–14), establishing a functional cross-talk between leptin and estrogen signaling pathways. The leptin–estrogen connection is further
supported by studies showing that obesity is associated with an

Suppression of Leptin Actions by Vitamin D

increase in systemic estrogen levels (15, 16) and that obese
women exhibit higher levels of ERa expression than lean
women in several types of cancers (17).
The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] or calcitriol, has antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties and is widely recognized as agent with
great potential for cancer intervention (18, 19). Previously, we
have shown that 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses the growth of multiple human ovarian cancer cells and ovarian tumors in mice
(20–25). It induces ovarian cancer cell death via telomerase
suppression mediated through miR-498 (25, 26), a primatespeciﬁc microRNA (miRNA) of which the expression is
normally restricted to placenta. In this study, we present
experimental evidences showing that leptin and high-fat diet
(HFD) stimulated the growth of estrogen-sensitive tumors
through ERa activation and telomerase induction, which was
suppressed by 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogue EB1089 through
miR-498. The studies suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 or its precursors may be used to reduce obesity-associated risks for estrogen-sensitive cancers in women and that clinical trials with
obese women may reveal the effectiveness of vitamin D in
cancer intervention, a controversial issue debated in both the
scientiﬁc community and public arena.

Materials and Methods
Materials and cell lines
1,25(OH)2D3, human recombinant leptin, 17b-estradiol (E2),
and ICI 182,780 were purchased from Sigma. Anti-VDR and
anti–human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) antibodies were from Epitomics. Antibodies against ERa and
b-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
pLEN-hERa, EREelbLuc, pCMVbGal, and miR-498 sponges
have been used in previous studies (26, 27). BG-1 cells (28)
were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 2
mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) . MCF-7 and Ishikawa
(29) cells were maintained in DMEM containing 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin,
and 5% FCS. PE-04 cells (30) were maintained in RPMI
medium containing 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10% FCS. All cells were
maintained at 37 C in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2.
ERa expression and estrogen sensitivity of BG-1 (28), PE-04
(30), and Ishikawa (29) cells were validated, and morphologic
analyses and genotyping by Genetics DNA Laboratories were
used to ensure that the cells are not cross-contaminated with
MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were from the American Type
Culture Collection and authenticated with its guidelines. For
all studies involving estrogen treatments, cells were deprived
of estrogens by culturing for 2 days in phenol red–free
medium containing 2% charcoal-stripped FCS.
Transfections and reporter assays
Cells were plated in medium containing 5% FCS at 1.5 
105 cells per well in 6-well plates. One day after plating, cells
were transfected with Lipofectamine following the protocol
from Invitrogen (Life Technologies) and were placed in
phenol red–free DMEM/F-12 containing 2% charcoal-

stripped FCS. Forty-eight hours after transfections, cells
were treated with vehicle (EtOH), E2 or leptin in the presence or absence of 1,25(OH)2D3 for 3 days. For longer
treatments, cells were re-fed with fresh culture medium
every 2 days. Luciferase and b-galactosidase (b-gal) activities
were determined as previously described (20).
To establish luciferase-marked cells that express miRNA
sponges, BG-1 cells were cotransfected with control or miR-498
sponges together with pGL3 control plasmid as previously
described (26). Stable clones were isolated after selection with
puromycin (2 mg/mL) for about 5 weeks.
Quantitative RT-PCR assays
Total and small RNAs were extracted from cells using the
mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was reverse-transcribed
from 1 mg total cellular RNA with random hexamer primers
and thermo-stable reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). TaqMan
assays (Life Technologies) were used to quantify the expression
of hTERT mRNA and mature miR-498. GAPDH and U6 were
used as controls for hTERT and miR-498 expression studies,
respectively. PCR reactions were carried out in a 20-mL reaction
mixture containing 1.33 mL of reverse transcribed product, 1.0
mL of corresponding TaqMan probe, and 10-mL TaqMan 2
universal PCR master mix. Reactions were run in the ABI Prism
7900 Fast Real-Time PCR system in triplicate with incubation
at 95 C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles of denaturation for
15 seconds at 95 C and annealing at 60 C for 1 minute. The
target gene levels at each time point were normalized with
cognate controls by subtracting the cycle threshold (Ct) value
of controls from Ct of target genes to produce a DCt. The fold of
induction over vehicle controls was calculated on the basis of
the formula 2½DCt ðtreatmentÞDCt ðvehicleÞ .
Immunoblotting analyses
Cells were estrogen-starved and treated with vehicle, E2 or
leptin in the presence or absence of 1,25(OH)2D3 for 3 days
and lysed on ice by incubating for 20 minutes with lysis
buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 1 mmol/L PMSF,
and protease inhibitor cocktail. After centrifugation, protein
concentrations of the supernatant were determined using
the Bio-Rad assays. Samples of equal amount proteins were
separated in SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane, and probed with cognate antibodies. Immunoreacted proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) plus.
MTT assays, apoptosis, and cell-cycle analyses
To quantify cell growth, the MTT assays were performed as
described previously (31). Cells were estrogen starved and
plated at 5  104 in 96-well plates and treated with vehicle,
E2, or leptin in the presence or absence of 1,25(OH)2D3 for 6
days. The MTT reagents were added to each well to give a ﬁnal
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and incubated with cells for 3
hours. After the removal of the media, 200-mL DMSO was added
to the cells. The absorption at 595 nm was determined with a
microplate reader (DYNEX Technologies).

studies, mice were divided into two diet groups (n ¼ 20/group).
Group I was fed with vitamin D–deﬁcient diet (VDD) containing 22.9%-kcal fat supplemented with 0.47% calcium. Group II
received the same calcium-supplemented VDD but containing
HFD (55%-kcal). The diet was obtained from Harlan Teklad.
To establish ovarian tumors in mice, BG-1 cells stably
transfected with pGL3-control (luciferase) and control or
miR-498 sponges were harvested and resuspended at a concentration of 5  106 cells in 100 mL of DMEM/F-12 medium
containing 5% FCS and ice-cold Matrigel (1:1) and injected i.p.
into mice that have been on VDD or HFD diets for a week.
Mice were randomized and treated every other day with either
vehicle or EB1089 (Pure Chemistry Scientiﬁc Inc.) at 0.5 mg/kg
body weight diluted in sesame oil in a volume of 50 mL by
gavage. All mice were weighed once per week over the course of
treatment to monitor changes in body weight. Tumor growths
were measured with IVIS-200 (Xenogen) live imaging system at
30 and 60 days as described previously (26). All animals were
euthanized after treatment for 60 days. Tumor weight and the
number of nodules in the abdominal cavity were scored.

To determine the apoptotic index, cells were treated with
vehicle or leptin in the presence or absence of 1,25(OH)2D3 for 6
days, harvested, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). Cell suspensions were incubated with FITC and propidium iodide (PI) according to the manufacturer's protocol
(FITC Annexin V Kit; BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry was
performed in a FACScan (BD Biosciences). For each data point,
triplicate samples were analyzed and the experiment was
reproduced three times.
To determine cell-cycle distribution, cells were harvested,
washed with PBS, and ﬁxed with 70% ethanol for 2 hours. Fixed
cells were washed again with PBS, resuspended in staining
solution of 1-mL PBS containing 10-mg/mL DNase-free RNase
and PI and incubated for 3 hours at 4 C. Cell populations
distributed at different phases of the cell cycle were quantiﬁed
by FACScan. For each data point, triplicate samples were
analyzed and the experiment was repeated three times.
HFD and ovarian tumor studies
Female athymic nu/nu mice of 4- to 6-week-old were
obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley. Mice were housed at
University of South Florida (USF; Tampa, FL) animal facility at
the appropriate temperature and with a standard 12-hour
light–dark cycle. All mouse studies were carried out according
to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at University of South Florida. For tumor

Suppression of Leptin Actions by Vitamin D

Leptin increases hTERT expression and cell growth
through ERa
Leptin has been shown to stimulate ERa transactivation
(12–14), and as mentioned earlier, estrogens stimulate hTERT
expression through EREs present in the hTERT promoter.
Thus, it is possible for leptin to stimulate hTERT expression
and cell growth through ERa in ovarian cancer cells. As shown
in Fig. 2A, leptin signiﬁcantly increased the transcriptional
activity of ERa in BG-1 cells in reporter assays, which was
blocked by pure ERa antagonist ICI 182,780. Similarly, qRTPCR analyses and the MTT assays, respectively, revealed that
leptin signiﬁcantly stimulated hTERT expression (Fig. 2B) and
cell growth (Fig 2C), both of which were blocked by ICI 182,780.
These analyses demonstrate that ERa mediates the leptin
effect on telomerase expression and cell growth in ovarian
cancer cells.

1,25(OH)2D3 dominates over estrogens in controlling
miR-498 and hTERT expression and cell growth
Estrogens have been shown to stimulate hTERT gene
expression and telomerase activity in breast (32), ovarian
(33, 34), and endometrial (35) cancer cells, which involve
estrogen response elements (ERE) present in the hTERT
promoter. Our recent studies identiﬁed miR-498 as a primary target gene for 1,25(OH)2D3 that binds to hTERT 30 untranslated region (UTR) and decreases telomerase activity
in ovarian cancer cells (26), making it possible for 1,25
(OH)2D3 to inhibit estrogen-induced telomerase activity and
cell growth through miR-498. To test this idea, we examined
whether 1,25(OH)2D3 induced miR-498 in estrogen-sensitive
ovarian cancer cells and whether the induction occurred in
the presence of E2. As shown in Fig. 1A, miR-498 was
signiﬁcantly induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in BG-1 cells and that
the induction occurred similarly in the absence or presence
of E2. Consistent with the miR-498 data, 1,25(OH)2D3 suppressed E2-induced hTERT expression at mRNA (Fig. 1B)
and protein (Fig. 1C) levels. These analyses show that 1,25
(OH)2D3 antagonizes and dominates over estrogen actions in
regulating miR-498 and hTERT expression in ovarian cancer
cells. The 1,25(OH)2D3 dominance was further supported by
the ﬁndings that 1,25(OH)2D3 suppressed E2 stimulation of
BG-1 cell growth (Fig. 1D) and that 1,25(OH)2D3-induced
increase in VDR protein expression was not affected by E2
(Fig. 1C). In these analyses, 1,25(OH)2D3 did not alter the
ability of E2 to downregulate ERa a (Fig. 1C), a process
required for efﬁcient ERa transactivation (36), indicating
that the dominant effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 over E2 is likely to
be exerted at steps downstream of ERa transactivation by its
ligands.

transfectants to leptin and 1,25(OH)2D3 was analyzed. As
shown in Fig. 4, 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased leptin-induced hTERT
expression (Fig. 4A) and cell growth (Fig 4B) in cells transfected
with control sponges but had little effect in cells expressing
miR-498 sponges, showing that the suppression of leptin
actions was mediated through miR-498. Consistent with its
known proliferative activity, leptin increased the percentage of
BG-1 cells in S-phase, which was also suppressed by 1,25
(OH)2D3 in cells transfected with control but not miR-498
sponges (Fig 4C). The studies demonstrate that leptin stimulates ovarian cancer cell growth through telomerase induction
and that 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses the leptin effect through miR498. In the analyses, leptin had little effect on the ability of 1,25
(OH)2D3 to induce cell death, whereas miR-498 sponges, as
expected, signiﬁcantly relieved the apoptotic induction by the
hormone (Fig. 4D), showing that the role of miR-498 in the
induction of ovarian cancer cell death initially established in
OVCAR3 cells is applicable to estrogen-sensitive cells. In BG-1
cells, miR-498 sponges partially relieved the suppressive effect
of 1,25(OH)2D3 on leptin stimulation of S-phase accumulation,
suggesting that the role of miR-498 in 1,25(OH)2D3 actions in
estrogen-sensitive ovarian cancer cells goes beyond cell death
induction.

expression and ovarian cancer cell growth through the
miRNA. To test this concept, we ﬁrst assessed the ability
of 1,25(OH)2D3 to induce miR-498 in the presence or absence
of leptin in BG-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, 1,25(OH)2D3
stimulated miR-498 expression to comparable levels in the
presence or absence of leptin, showing a dominance of 1,25
(OH)2D3 over leptin in miR-498 induction. Consistent with
the dominance in controlling miR-498 expression, 1,25
(OH)2D3 attenuated leptin-induced hTERT mRNA (Fig. 3B)
and protein (Fig. 3C) expression as well as BG-1 cell growth
(Fig. 3D). In these analyses, leptin decreased the ERa protein
expression, likely due to ERa activation by the adipokine,
and the decrease also occurred in cells cotreated with 1,25
(OH)2D3 (Fig. 3E). On the other hand, 1,25(OH)2D3 increased
VDR protein expression, which also occurred in the presence
of leptin (Fig. 3E). These analyses show that 1,25(OH)2D3 is
dominant over leptin in controlling ovarian cancer cell
growth and that this dominant action occurs at steps
downstream of ERa activation by leptin, which likely
involves miR-498-mediated hTERT downregulation.
To assess the role of miR-498 in the dominant action of 1,25
(OH)2D3 over leptin, control and miR-498 sponges (26) were
stably transfected into BG-1 cells and the response of the stable

(M-bSP) sponges were stably transfected into BG-1 cells. The stable clones were treated with EtOH (Control), 10 mol/L VD, leptin (100 ng/mL), or

10 mol/L VD plus leptin (100 ng/mL) for 3 days. Total RNAs were extracted and the expression of hTERT was determined by qRT-PCR and normalized to
GAPDH. The values are expressed as fold of the control. B, cells were treated as in A but for 6 days. Cell growth was measured in the MTT assays. C, cells
were treated as in B and stained with PI. Cell-cycle distribution was assessed by ﬂow cytometry. D, cells were treated as in B. Apoptosis was measured by FITC
Annexin-V analyses. Data represent three independent experiments and are presented as the mean  SD. Statistical analyses were performed with the
Student t test (n ¼ 3 in A, C, and D; n ¼ 10 in B).

1,25(OH)2D3 analogue EB1089 suppresses HFD-induced
ovarian tumor growth in mice through miR-498
HFD is known to increase serum leptin levels, cause leptin
resistance, and promote the development of obesity and
cancer (37). The dominance of 1,25(OH)2D3 over leptin through
miR-498 makes it likely for 1,25(OH)2D3 to suppress HFDinduced ovarian tumor growth. To test this idea, BG-1 cells
stably transfected with ﬁreﬂy luciferase together with either
control or miR-498 sponges were injected into peritoneal cavity
of nude mice. The mice were then treated for up to 60 days with
a vehicle or synthetic 1,25(OH)2D3 analogue EB1089 that is
known to be less calcemic and more potent in tumor suppression. Tumor growth was monitored by live luciferase imaging
(Fig. 5A and B), counting numbers and size of tumor nodules
(Supplementary Fig. S1A) and measuring tumor weight (Supplementary Fig. S1B). As shown in Fig. 5A and B, the growth of
tumors expressing control sponges was signiﬁcantly suppressed by EB1089 in mice fed with VDD diet. The suppression
was largely diminished in tumors expressing miR-498 sponges,
showing the importance of miR-498. More importantly, HFD
stimulated BG-1 tumor growth by up to 6-fold, which was
remarkably suppressed by EB1089 in groups expressing control
sponges but not in those expressing miR-498 sponges. In
parallel studies, tumors expressing miR-498 sponges grew
faster than those expressing control sponges in vehicle-treated
groups, revealing a role of basal miR-498 expression in sup-

pressing basal and HFD-induced ovarian tumor growth. Ki67
staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays of tumor tissue sections revealed that the tumor suppression by EB1089 is associated with decreased proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S2)
and increased apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3). Overall, the
data show that EB1089 suppresses the HFD-induced ovarian
tumor growth and that miR-498 is an important mediator of
this antitumor effect.
As expected, mice fed with HFD were heavier than mice on
VDD diet and the difference became statistically signiﬁcant
(P < 0.0001) since 4 weeks of the experiment (Fig. 6A). Serum
leptin levels at the end of the experiment were also signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.0001) increased in mice on HFD as compared with those
on VDD diet (Fig. 6B). Neither EB1089 nor miR-498 sponges
altered the effect of HFD on body weight and serum leptin
levels. EB1089 increase serum calcium levels but did not induce
hypercalcemia (Supplementary Fig. S4). qRT-PCR (Fig. 6C) and
Western blot (Fig. 6D) analyses showed that levels of hTERT
mRNA and protein expression in tumors were signiﬁcantly
suppressed by EB1089 in both VDD and HFD groups, and that
miR-498 sponges diminished the suppressive effect of EB1089.
The data suggest that HFD increased leptin to stimulate
ovarian tumor growth in vivo and the stimulation of tumor
growth was suppressed by EB1089 through miR-498-mediated
hTERT downregulation.

Inverse regulation of miR-498 and hTERT expression by
1,25(OH)2D3 in multiple ERa-positive cancer cell lines
The studies described above have established the concept
that 1,25(OH)2D3 and EB1089 suppress BG-1 ovarian tumor
growth induced by leptin and HFD through miR-498-mediated
telomerase downregulation. To assess whether the concept
can be extended to other estrogen-sensitive cancers, a panel of
estrogen-sensitive cancer cell lines, including ovarian (PE-04),
breast (MCF-7), and endometrial (Ishikawa) cells, were treated
with EtOH or 1,25(OH)2D3 for 0, 3, and 6 days, and the
expression of miR-498 and hTERT mRNA was determined by
qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig 7, miR-498 (Fig 7A) and hTERT
mRNA (Fig 7B) expressions was inversely regulated by 1,25

(OH)2D3 in a time-dependent manner. As in BG-1 cells, 1,25
(OH)2D3 induced apoptosis in PE-04, MCF-7, and Ishikawa cells
(Fig 7C), which was not affected by leptin, and suppressed
leptin-induced growth (Fig. 7D) of these cells, showing that the
concept established in BG-1 tumors (Fig. 7E) can be extended
to other estrogen-sensitive ovarian cancer as well as breast and
uterine cancers. Dosage analyses revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3
induced apoptosis at concentrations as low as 1 nmol/L and
that the induction occurred in a dose-dependent manner in
both BG-1 and MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5), showing
that the hormone killed estrogen-sensitive tumor cells at
physiologic concentrations. Interestingly, miR-498 induction
was not observed in vitamin D–sensitive HCT116 (colon) and
LNCaP (prostate) cancer cells (data not shown), showing a
speciﬁcity to women's cancers.

Cancer Res; 74(21) November 1, 2014

Telomerase is a hallmark of cancer that cells must possess to
overcome two proliferative barriers, senescence and crisisassociated apoptosis, to become cancerous (38). Because of the
critically short telomere length, telomerase activity remains
rate-limiting in cancer cells, explaining why tumor-promoting
factors need to increase telomerase activity to increase tumor
growth. In the present studies, ICI 182,780, a pure ERa antagonist, diminished the ability of leptin to induce hTERT expression, cell growth, and ERa transcriptional activity, deﬁning
ERa-mediated hTERT induction as the main mechanism
underlying leptin stimulation of estrogen-sensitive ovarian
cancer growth. 1,25(OH)2D3 suppressed such a leptin action
through miR-498-mediated hTERT destruction, which was
translated into the suppression of HFD-induced hTERT
expression and ovarian tumor growth in vivo in mice (Fig.
7E). In addition to BG-1 cells, miR-498 induction and hTERT
downregulation by 1,25(OH)2D3 were also detected in ERapositive PE-04, MCF-7, and Ishikawa cells, showing that the
concept that 1,25(OH)2D3 may prevent obesity-associated
cancers can be generalized to estrogen-sensitive ovarian as
well as breast and uterine cancers.
Previous studies in estrogen-insensitive ovarian cancer cells
have deﬁned miR-498 as a primary 1,25(OH)2D3 target gene
that directly binds to the 30 -UTR of hTERT mRNA to induce cell
death (26). The present studies are the ﬁrst to document an
important role for miR-498 in mediating the suppressive effect
of 1,25(OH)2D3 on estrogen stimulation of cancer growth. The
studies are also the ﬁrst to document a cross-talk between
leptin and 1,25(OH)2D3 and place telomerase and the miRNA
pathway at the center stage. It is important to point out that
our studies do not project miR-498-mediated hTERT degradation as the sole mechanism underlying the 1,25(OH)2D3
suppression of estrogen and leptin actions in cancer cells.
1,25(OH)2D3 has been reported to decrease ERa expression
and activity in MCF-7 cells (39, 40). In BG-1 cells, 1,25(OH)2D3
caused a modest reduction in ERa protein expression (Fig 1C)
and decreased its transcriptional activity in reporter assays
(data not shown), suggesting that the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on
ERa expression and/or activity may also contribute to its
suppression of leptin actions in ovarian cancer cells.

Nevertheless, the fact that miR-498 sponges relieved majority
of the suppressive effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on leptin and HFDinduced ovarian cancer growth shows that the miR-498 pathway is the main mediator of the 1,25(OH)2D3 effect on leptin.
Although present studies have focused on how 1,25(OH)2D3
suppresses ERa-mediated leptin effect on telomerase, there
are no reasons to believe that the impact of 1,25(OH)2D3 action
through miR-498 on telomerase will be limited to leptin action
or ERa-positive tumors. Recently, hypercholesterolemia,
another obesity comorbidity and an independent cancer risk
factor in postmenopausal women, has been shown to activate
ERa and liver X receptor to control breast cancer growth and
invasion after converting into 27-hydroxycholesterol (41).
Although remaining to be determined, 27-hydroxycholesterol
may increase telomerase activity through ERa and 1,25
(OH)2D3 may prevent hypercholesterolemia-associated cancer

risk through miR-498. Likewise, leptin has been shown to
increase telomerase activity in breast and hepatocellular carcinoma cells through STAT3 (42, 43) and c-Myc (43), which may
not depend on ERa. 1,25(OH)2D3 should also be able to
suppress the ERa-independent leptin effect on telomerase
through the same miR-498 pathway.
Although controversial, literature information, in general,
supports an association between obesity and the risk of ovarian
cancer (44–46). Similarly, the estrogen sensitivity of human
ovarian cancer has been implicated by the facts that hormone
replacement therapy increased ovarian cancer incidence (47)
and that its decreased usage after the Women's Health Initiative studies was associated with a reduction (48). Despite the
estrogen sensitivity of their cancers, patients with ovarian
cancer do not beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from treatments with antiestrogens or aromatase inhibitors. 1,25(OH)2D3 may offer an

destruction to suppress the stimulatory effect of HFD and leptin (see text for details).

effective approach to block ERa actions, which may be used to
selectively reduce ovarian cancer risk in obese women. Consistent with this idea, the well-publicized Cohort Consortium
Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rare Cancers revealed an inverse
correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and ovarian
cancer risk that reached statistical signiﬁcance only in obese
women (49).
The concept that vitamin D may prevent cancers has been
supported by epidemiologic and molecular studies from many
laboratories. However, population-based studies aiming to
advance vitamin D into clinics for cancer intervention are
complicated by many issues such as timing, dosages, and
duration, etc. With personalized medicine concept in mind,
one may argue that the key to success will be the identiﬁcation
of a subpopulation of human subjects who are highly sensitive
to vitamin D. The present studies argue that two groups of
women may beneﬁt greatly from vitamin D intervention. One
group would be women who are overweight or obese. The idea

6202

Cancer Res; 74(21) November 1, 2014

is consistent with literature information that obesity is usually
correlated with low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3,
which was projected to be responsible for 20% of the cancer
risk linked to increased body mass index (50). Another group
would be postmenopausal women who receive hormone
replacement therapy, which are known to increase their cancer
risks. Well-controlled clinical trials should be carried out to
determine whether vitamin D will offer a nontoxic and economic way of cancer intervention in overweight and obese
women and whether its addition to the current hormone
replacement therapy formula will cut down the increase in
cancer risks.
