Abstract
We investigated whether impaired regulation of bone morphogenetic protein-2
(BMP-2) via epigenetic pathways is associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
pathogenesis. Expression and CpG methylation of the BMP-2 gene were analyzed
using RCC cell lines, and 96 matched RCC and normal renal tissues. We also performed
functional analysis using BMP-2 restored RCC cells. A significant association of BMP2 mRNA expression was also found with advanced tumor stage and lymph node
involvement, while lower BMP-2 mRNA expression was significantly associated with
poor overall survival after radical nephrectomy. In RCC cells, BMP-2 restoration
significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation.
In addition, BMP-2 overexpression induced p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 expression, and
cellular apoptosis in RCC cells. BMP-2 mRNA expression was significantly enhanced
in RCC cells by 5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine treatment. The prevalence of BMP-2 promoter
methylation was significantly greater and BMP-2 mRNA expression was significantly
lower in RCC samples as compared to normal kidney samples. Furthermore, a
significant correlation was found between BMP-2 promoter methylation and mRNA
transcription in tumors. Aberrant BMP-2 methylation and the resultant loss of BMP-2
expression may be a useful molecular marker for designing improved diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies for RCC.

Introduction

recurrence and/or metastasis after curative radical surgery
[4]. Although several prognostic models of RCC based
on clinical parameters have been developed [5, 6],
they all lack accuracy, probably due to the biologically
heterogeneous nature of the disease. Therefore, efficient
and reliable molecular biomarkers to predict cancer
progression are urgently needed to develop better
therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.
Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), a member
of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily,

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most
commonly encountered urological cancers, accounting
for 2-3% of all tumor malignancies in adults [1]. The
major cause of death from RCC is metastasis and the
5-year survival rate for affected patients with metastasis
is less than 10% [2]. Indeed, 25% of RCC patients show
metastasis at the time of diagnosis [3]. In addition,
up to one third of localized RCC patients experience

cartilage and ectopic osteogenesis [7]. In addition to
bone formation, BMP-2 plays important roles in cell
differentiation, proliferation, morphogenesis, and
apoptosis [8-11]. Similar to TGF-β, BMP-2 exerts its effect
via 2 types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase
receptors; BMP receptor type I (BMPRI) and II (BMPRII).
BMP-2 binding to BMPRII triggers phosphorylation of
BMPRI, and activation of downstream signaling via Smaand Mad-related (Smad) proteins; e.g., Smad1, Smad5,
and Smad8. Phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 subsequently
form complexes with Smad4 and then translocates to
the nucleus to regulate a variety of genes that arrest cell
growth and induce apoptosis [12, 13].
BMP-2 is thought to be a putative tumor-suppressor
gene in several types of cancer (i.e., gastric, colon,
prostate, adrenal) [10, 11, 14-17]. Recently, Wang et al.
[18] demonstrated that BMP-2 inhibits RCC growth by
causing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. On the other
hand, Markić et al. [19] showed that expression levels of
BMP-2 were strongly elevated with increased TNM stage
in clinical RCC. However, the biological effects of BMP-2
on RCC development and progression remain to be fully
elucidated, because only limited information is available
for BMP-2 in human RCC.
DNA methylation of CpG islands involving the
promoter of tumor suppressor genes is a well-known
mechanism underlying gene silencing, which leads to
functional loss as a tumor suppressor [20, 21]. Previous
studies have shown that the expression level of BMP-2
is frequently down-regulated because of promoter CpG
hypermethylation [14, 15]. Therefore, we hypothesized
that impaired regulation of BMP-2 via an epigenetic
pathway may be associated with RCC pathogenesis.
In the present study, we assessed the correlation
between expression of the BMP-2 gene and epigenetic
mechanisms using 2 RCC cells lines, as well as 96
matched RCC and normal renal tissues. We also evaluated
the association of BMP-2 expression and BMP-2 CpG
methylation status with clinical parameters and prognosis
in cases of RCC following radical nephrectomy. Finally,
we over-expressed BMP-2 in kidney cancer cells and
performed functional analyses.

compared with the nonmalignant HK-2 cells. Next,
BMP-2 expression was evaluated in 96 RCC samples and
matched normal renal tissues. As shown in Figure 1C,
RCC showed a lower level of BMP-2 mRNA expression
in comparison with that of the corresponding normal renal
tissues (P=0.0144). We also investigated the expression of
BMP-2 using immunohistochemical staining. BMP-2 was
significantly higher in the tubular cytoplasm of normal
renal cells as compared to that of the RCC (P<0.0001;
Fig. 1D, E). Furthermore, there was a positive correlation
between BMP-2 mRNA transcription and protein level
(data not shown).

BMP-2 is regulated by promoter CpG methylation
in RCC
We used 5-aza-dC to screen for the epigenetic status
of BMP-2 in RCC cell lines. In Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells,
the expression level of the BMP-2 mRNA transcript was
significantly increased after 5-aza-dC treatment (Fig.
2C), suggesting that promoter CpG methylation may
be associated with BMP-2 expression in these cells. To
confirm the relationship between CpG methylation and
expression of the BMP-2 mRNA transcript, we performed
MSP analysis. As shown in Figure 2A and B, MSP and
USP primers were designed based on a previous report
[14]. Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells, which slightly express the
BMP-2 gene, were partially methylated (Fig. 2D).
We further performed MSP analysis of the 96 RCC
tissue samples. Representative MSP and USP bands of
8 matched RCC and normal renal tissues are shown in
Figure 2E. Most RCC tissues showed both MSP and USP
bands, whereas most normal renal tissues showed only
a USP band. Forty-six of the 96 RCC tissues (47.9%)
were found to be positive for BMP-2 methylation, while
16 of 96 normal kidney tissues (17.7%) were positive
(P<0.0001; Fig. 2F). Bisulfite DNA sequencing was also
performed to confirm whether the MSP bands reflected the
true methylation status of the CpG sites. Representative
bisulfite DNA sequencing findings for RCC and normal
renal tissues are shown in Figure 2G. In a normal kidney
sample (No. 2 Normal), the majority of cytosines within
CpG sites were completely converted to thymines (unmethylated) after bisulfite modification. On the other hand,
the majority of cytosines remained virtually unchanged
after bisulfite modification in an RCC sample (No. 8
Tumor). These results indicated that methylation analysis
using a combination of MSP and USP was consistent with
the results from bisulfite DNA sequencing.
Next, we evaluated the correlation between
methylation status and BMP-2 expression in RCC
samples. A significant inverse correlation was found
between BMP-2 mRNA transcripts and methylation of
the BMP-2 promoter in the RCC samples (P=0.0079; Fig.
3A). In addition, RCC samples with an un-methylated alle

metastasis (P=0.038, P=0.0024, respectively). Also, the
RCC patients with positive methylation had a higher
stage as compared to those with negative methylation,
though the difference did not reach statistical significance
(P=0.0701). However, there was no significant association
of BMP-2 methylation with tumor grade found.
Correlations of clinicopathological findings with BMP-2
mRNA expression are shown in Figure 3C and D. A lower
expression level of the BMP-2 mRNA transcript was also
significantly correlated with high-stage disease and lymph
node involvement (P=0.0065, P=0.024, respectively).
Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (OS) after
radical nephrectomy are shown in Figure 3E and F. OS
in the BMP-2 methylated group was significantly worse
in comparison with that in the BMP-2 un-methylated
group (P=0.025; Fig. 3E). Likewise, when the expression
level of the BMP-2 mRNA transcript was divided into
2 groups based on mean values, lower expression was
significantly associated with poor prognosis (P=0.039;
Fig. 3F). As shown in Table 2, BMP-2 methylation
status, BMP-2 mRNA expression, tumor stage, and tumor
grade were identified as significant factors contributing
to OS in univariate analysis. When these variables were
subjected to a multivariate model, BMP-2 expression and
tumor stage were shown to be significantly independent
predictors for OS after a radical nephrectomy.

[18]. Our result indicates that RCC cells have a potential
capability of being activated by BMP-2, though they have
lower levels of BMPRII as compared to HK-2 cells.
After transient transfection of a plasmid containing
human BMP-2 into Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells, significant
amounts of BMP-2 protein were detected by Western
blotting (Fig. 4A). Cell proliferation (Fig. 4B) and
wound healing (Fig. 4C) results demonstrated significant
inhibition with BMP-2 transfectants for both Caki1 and Caki-2 cells as compared to the control vector
transfectants. Matrigel invasion assay also showed that
the number of invaded cells was significantly decreased
in the BMP-2 transfectants as compared with their control
counterparts (Fig. 4D). In addition, overexpression of
BMP-2 inhibited colony-formation in both Caki-1 and
Caki-2 cells (Fig. 4E). Thus, these results suggest that
BMP-2 plays an important role in RCC progression.

BMP-2 induces p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 expression
in RCC via the Smad pathway
A previous study indicated that the anti-proliferative
effect of BMP-2 in RCC cell lines may be due to cell cycle
arrest in the G1 phase [18]. In addition, accumulation of
p21WAF1/CIP1 and/or p27KIP1 in response to activation of
the BMP-Smad pathway contributes to growth arrest in
several types of cancer [22-25]. Therefore we examined
the expression of Smad1/5/8, phospho-Smad1/5/8,
and several cell cycle regulatory genes using Western
analysis. As shown in Figure 5A, expression of phosphoSmad1/5/8, p21WAF1/CIP1, and p27KIP1 proteins were
significantly increased after transfection with BMP-2 in
Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells. Conversely, expression of Cdk2
protein in BMP-2 transfectants in both RCC cell lines was
significantly decreased in comparison with the control.
Next, we examined the mRNA expression of
p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 in clinical samples. That of p27KIP1
was significantly higher in the RCC samples than in the
normal renal tissues (P<0.0001; Fig. 5B). Interestingly,
there was a significant inverse correlation between BMP-

in RCC, we examined whether over-expression of BMP2 has effects on cell viability, migration and invasion
properties, and colony-formation ability of RCC cell
lines. Initially, mRNA expression of the BMP-2 receptors
BMPRIa, BMPRIb, and BMPRII was evaluated, because
BMP-2 induces a physiological response via their
activation [12, 13]. As shown in Supplementary Figure S1,
all of the BMP receptors were found to be expressed in
Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells, consistent with previous findings

in mRNA levels between the RCC samples and normal

Since BMP-2 restoration significantly inhibited
proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation
in RCC cell lines, we hypothesized that its expression

may induce apoptosis. The results of apoptosis assays
of Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells performed 24 hours posttransfection are shown in Figure 6A and B. Apoptotic
and early apoptotic fractions (upper right and lower
right, respectively, in quadrant images) were significantly
greater in BMP-2 transfectants as compared to the vector
control. These differences were also seen in both Caki-1
and Caki-2 cells at 48 hours after transfection (data not
shown). These findings indicate a pro-apoptotic role for
BMP-2, as well as its effects on the apoptotic pathway
and regulation of tumorigenicity. In our recent study, we
found that growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene
45α (GADD45α) may play important roles in human RCC
apoptosis [26]. Therefore, we examined the expression of
several apoptotic proteins and GADD45α protein using
Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6C, BMP-2
over-expression caused an increase in cleaved caspase-3
in both Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells, further supporting the
pro-apoptotic role of BMP-2. Furthermore, GADD45α
was up-regulated, indicating that overexpression of BMP2 induced GADD45α and apoptotic effects. Figure 7
indicates the putative BMP-2 pathway in RCC on the basis
of our results and previous studies [12, 13, 25, 27].

The incidence of RCC has been steadily increasing
over recent decades in North America as well as Japan
[28, 29]. Although currently employed molecular targeted
drugs may be promising as treatment to prevent tumor
progression [30, 31], they have not shown robust antitumor effects. Therefore, increased understanding of the
process of tumor progression may contribute to better
treatment options for RCC patients. To date, several
studies have shown that BMP-2 inhibits the growth of
tumor cells in various types of cancer including RCC [10,
11, 14-18]. With this background in mind, we focused
on the role of BMP-2 in RCC tumorigenesis. Our results
demonstrated a potential prognostic role for BMP-2 in
RCC based on its significantly lower expression in patients
with advanced stage and lymph node involvement. We
also found that lower OS probability was significantly
associated with lower BMP-2 expression. Furthermore,
multivariate analysis clearly demonstrated the prognostic
relevance of BMP-2 expression to predict OS after
surgery. Thus, BMP-2 has a strong tumor suppressive
potential in human RCC and may be useful for predicting

that CpG hypermethylation regulates BMP-2 gene
expression in human RCC cells. We also found that the
prevalence of BMP-2 CpG methylation was significantly
higher in RCC samples than normal renal tissues by MSP
analysis and bisulfite DNA sequencings. In addition,
both BMP-2 mRNA and protein expression levels were
significantly lower in methylated than none-methylated
RCC samples, indicating epigenetic regulation of BMP2 in the clinical samples as well. Interestingly, BMP-2
methylation status was correlated with poor prognostic
factors (i.e., infiltrative growth pattern and systematic
metastasis) and shorter OS as well as BMP-2 expression.

OS following radical nephrectomy.
DNA methylation is one of the most common
epigenetic changes that occurs in human cancers
and many tumor-related genes are silenced by DNA
hypermethylation in RCC [32, 33].It has been reported
that BMP-2 expression is frequently regulated by DNA
hypermethylation in colorectal and gastric cancers [14,
15]. Therefore, we evaluated whether BMP-2 expression
is regulated by alteration of CpG methylation in RCC.
Both Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells showed a significant increase
in BMP-2 mRNA expression following 5 aza-dC treatment
compared to non-treated cells and MSP analysis suggested

This is the first study to report that the expression of BMP2 is regulated by promoter CpG methylation in RCC.
Overexpression of BMP-2 has been found to
decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness
of human colon cancer cell lines [10].We also noted that
BMP-2 re-expression strongly inhibited these activities
in RCC cell lines. Previous results indicate that BMP-2
blocs transition of the cell cycle from the G1 to S phase,
which then inhibits proliferation of several types of
cancer [11, 14, 18]. These anti-proliferative effects seem
to be responsible for the increased phosphorylation of
Smad1/5/8, and subsequent induction of cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors such as p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 [22-25].
These two proteins inhibit the activity of the cyclin E/
Cdk2 binary complex, which is required for G1/transition
[34-36]. Clinically, accumulation of altered cell cycle
regulators serves as an independent prognostic factor in
RCC [37, 38]. In this study, we demonstrated that the
expression of phospo-Smad1/5/8, p21WAF1/CIP1, and p27KIP1
were up-regulated, while that of Cdk2 was down-regulated
after BMP-2 restoration in RCC cell lines. Also, a positive
correlation between BMP-2 and p27KIP1 mRNA levels
was found in the RCC samples. These results suggest
that BMP-2-induced growth suppression may be partly
mediated by induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and/or p27KIP1 via
activation of a SMAD-dependent signaling pathway in
RCC (Figure 7).

The present study is the first to clearly demonstrate
that over expression of BMP-2 induces a significantly
increased level of apoptosis in RCC cell lines. Other
studies have reported that the anti-proliferative effect of
BMP-2 in different tumor cell lines, including gastric,
colon, and leukemia, may involve induction of apoptosis
[8-10]. However, the precise mechanism of BMP2-induced apoptosis in cancer cells remains unclear.
GADD45 proteins have been implicated in stress response,
cell cycle arrest, apoptosis [39, 40], and have also been
linked to c-Jun NH (2)-terminal kinase-mediated and
mitochondria-mediated cell death [27]. Interestingly
GADD45β, a member of the GADD45 family, has been
proposed to be a major BMP-2 responsive gene induced
in chondrocytes [41]. In addition, Tront et al. [42] found
that GADD45α may have a tumor suppressive function
in breast cancer. We also recently reported that downregulation of GADD45α inhibits cell death in RCC cell
lines [26]. In light of these observations, we sought to
determine whether GADD45α is associated with BMP-2mediated apoptosis and found GADD45α overexpression
following BMP-2 restoration in RCC cell lines. Thus,
GADD45α may play an essential role in BMP-2-mediated
apoptosis in RCC cells (Figure 7), though further research
is required to verify our findings.
In summary, our findings show that BMP-2 is an
important tumor suppressor that is down-regulated by

Figure 7: Schema of BMP-2/Smad signaling pathway in RCC. BMP-2 expression is regulated by DNA promoter methylation.

BMP-2 may cause the induction of GADD45a, p21 and p27 expression through the activation of Smad pathway. GADD45a will induce
apoptosis via caspase cascade. In addition, p21 and p27 will induce cell cycle arrest by inhibiting CDK2. These cell cycle arrest and
apoptotic effect may play an important role in the inhibition of tumor proliferation in RCC.

Genomic DNA from kidney samples was extracted
using a QIAamp Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and
precipitated with ethanol. Genomic DNA from cell
lines was extracted using DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen
Life Technologies, San Diego, CA) and total RNA was
extracted with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center,
Cincinnati, OH), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA pellets obtained after isopropanol
and ethanol precipitation were dried, resuspended in 25
μL of RNase-free water, and stored in aliquots at -80°C
until reverse transcribed. The concentrations of DNA and
RNA were determined with a spectrophotometer, and their
integrity was checked by gel electrophoresis.

RCC tissue samples
Ninety-six matched renal cell carcinoma (90 clear
cell carcinomas, 6 papillary carcinomas) and normal
renal tissues were obtained from the stocks of Shimane
University Hospital (Izumo, Japan). Median patient age at
surgery was 63 years old (range 16-87 years). Of the 96
patients, 63 were males and 41 of the lesions were located
on the right side. Fifty patients had a stage (Robson’s
classification) I, 15 patients a stage II, 20 a stage III, and
10 a stage IV. Thirty-three (34.4%) patients had tumor
grade 1, 53 (55.6%) were tumor grade 2, and the remaining
10 (10.4%) were tumor grade 3. Of the 96patients, 11
(11.5%) had metastatic disease at the initial diagnosis.
Each normal renal and RCC tissue specimen was halved,
then one half was fixed in 10% buffered formalin (pH 7.0)
and embedded in paraffin wax, with 5-mm-thick sections
subjected to H&E staining for histologic evaluation. The
remaining half of each sample was immediately frozen
and stored at -80°C for DNA and RNA extraction. Written
informed consent was obtained from each patient for
molecular analysis of the resected specimens and the study
protocol was approved by the local ethnical committee of
Shimane University Faculty of Medicine.

cDNA preparation and gene quantification
Using 1 μg of RNA, 0.5 μg of oligo-dT primer, and
0.5 units of RNase inhibitor, cDNA was constructed using
reverse transcriptase (Promega). The mRNA transcript
levels of BMP-2, BMPR1a, BMPR1b, BMPR2, p21WAF1/CIP1,
and p27KIP1 were measured with a 7500 Fast Real-Time
PCR System (Applied BioSystem), with glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the reference
gene. For clinical samples, a standard curve was generated
using a serial dilution of the external standard. The level
of expression was calculated as the ratio of the target gene
to that of the reference GAPDH. For cell line samples,
the data was analyzed using the delta-delta Ct method to
calculate the fold-change.

Cell lines and reagents

Treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine

A human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell
line, HK-2, and renal cancer cell lines Caki-1 and
Caki-2 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA). Keratinocyte serum-free
medium (K-SFM), bovine pituitary extract (BPE), and
recombinant epidermal growth factor (rEGF) were
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). McCoy’s 5A
and Opti-minimum essential medium were obtained from
the UCSG Cell Culture Facility (San Francisco, CA).
Fetal bovine serum (FBS) came from Atlanta Biologicals
(Lawrenceville, GA).

To screen for epigenetic alterations in the BMP-2
gene, Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells were treated in duplicate
with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC, 5 μmol/L), then
cultured cells were harvested after 4 days of treatment.
Using cDNA, the difference in expression level of the
BMP-2 mRNA transcripts before and after 5-aza-dC
treatment was analyzed with the 7500 Fast Real-Time
PCR System (Applied BioSystem).

promoter sequence of the BMP-2 gene [13], methylationand non-methylation-specific primers were designed using
MethPrimer. The regions amplified by these primers have
19 CpG sites and their relationship to the CpG sites are
shown in Figure 2A. For methylation-specific PCR (MSP),
a second round of nested PCR (MSP and USP) was done
using the universal PCR product amplified by Uni-S and
Uni-AS primers as a template. The first universal primer
sets had no CpG sites in either the forward or reverse
primer. For each assay, the absence of a DNA template
served as a negative control. The primer sequences for
universal, MSP, and USP are shown in Figure 2B. The
MSP and USP products were analyzed following 2%
agarose gel electrophoresis. For bisulfite DNA sequencing,
1 µl of bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified using a pair
of universal primers (Uni-S and Uni-AS) in a total volume
of 20 μL. Sequencing of the PCR products using either a
forward or reverse universal primer was done according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA).

MA, USA). Transfected cells were re-suspended in culture
medium without FBS and placed in the upper chambers
in triplicate. After 48 hours of incubation at 37°C, cells
migrating through the membrane were stained. The results
are expressed as invaded cells quantified at OD 560 nm.

Colony formation assay
Colony formation assays were performed using a
CytoSelectTM 96-Well Cell Transformation Assay (Cell
Bioloabs). Briefly, 600 transfected cells were seeded into
each well of 96-well microplates and incubated for 8 days.
Then, quantitation of colony formation was determined
by adding MTT solution to each well and measuring
absorbance at 570 nm with a SPECTRA MAX 190 plate
reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

Apoptosis assay
Fluorescence-activated
cell-sorting
(FACS)
analysis for apoptosis was done at 24 and 48 hours posttransfection, using an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)/7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) staining
system (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and a Cell Lab
QuantaTM SC MPL (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).
Cells stained with annexin V-FITC only (early apoptotic),
or both annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD (late apoptotic) were
considered to be apoptotic cell fractions.

Transfection
For BMP-2 overexpression, Caki-1 and Caki-2
cells were transfected with a pCMV6-ENTRY vector
expressing human BMP-2 cDNA or an empty pCMV6ENTRY vector (OriGene Technologies, Rockville,
MD) using X-treme gene HD Transfection Reagent
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Western blot analysis

MTS assay

Whole cell extracts were prepared using
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA; Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL) containing a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Protein
quantification was done using a BCA protein assay kit
(Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Total cell protein (15-20 μg) was used for western blotting.
Samples were transferred to PVDF membranes, then
immersed in 3% skim milk with antibodies against BMP-2
(#ab14933, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), Smad1/5/8 (#12656
Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-SMAD1/5/8
(#sc-12353-R, Santa Cruz), p21WAF1/CIP1 (#2947, Cell
Signaling Technology), p27KIP1 (#2552, Cell Signaling
Technology), Cdk2 (#2546, Cell Signaling Technology),
Caspase-3 (#9662, Cell Signaling Technology), Cleaved
Caspase-3 (#9661, Cell Signaling Technology), and
GaDD45α (#4632, Cell Signaling Technology) overnight
at 4°C. Blots were washed in TBS containing 0.1%
Tween20 and labeled with horseradish peroxidase
conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology). Specific complexes were visualized with an
ECHO chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (GE
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) using the Chemidoc

Cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well
microplates at a density of 3×103 cells per well,
then transfected with BMP-2 the next day. At the
desired time points, the number of viable cells was
determined by adding a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)
-2H-tetrazolium-based CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution
Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) to each well and
measuring absorbance at 490 nm with a SPECTRA MAX
190 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

Migration and invasion assay
Cell migration was evaluated using a woundhealing assay. Cells were plated in 6-well dishes and
cell monolayers were scraped using a P-20 micropipette
tip. Wound closure was monitored and percent closure
measured. Cell invasion assay was performed using
modified Boyden Chambers consisting of transwell-precoated Matrigel membrane filter inserts with 8 micro-pores
in 24-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences, Bedford,

Disclosure of Potential Conflicts
of Interest

Immunohistochemical analysis

The authors have no potential conflicts of interest
to disclose.

Of the 96 patients with RCC who underwent
radical nephrectomy, specimens from 84 were available
for evaluation by immunostaining. Normal control
tissues were obtained from 62 of those 84 RCC patients.
Immunostaining of BMP-2 was performed using an
UltraVision Detection System (Thrmo Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 12
hours of incubation with a rabbit polyclonal antibody
for BMP-2 (1: 250, #ab14933, Abcam), DAB was
added as a chromogen, followed by counterstaining with
hematoxylin. For BMP-2 expression, cytoplasmic and
nuclear expression was analyzed according to the intensity
of positive cells using Image J software (http://rsb.info.
nih.gov/ij) and ranked on an overall scale from 0 to 3; with
0 indicating the absence of staining; 1, weak staining; 2,
moderate staining; and 3, strong staining.

Statistical analysis
Values are presented as the mean ± standard error
based on results obtained from at least 3 independent
experiments. All data were analyzed using the StatView
V statistical package (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
Relationships between 2 variables and numerical values
were analyzed using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney
U test or a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. A chisquare test was used for analyzing the correlation between
clinicopathologic parameters and BMP-2 methylation
status. Correlations between 2 continuous variables were
analyzed using Spearman’s rank correlation. Survival
curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meir method
and differences between 2 curves were analyzed with a log
rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses for overall
(OS) survival were performed using a Cox proportional
hazards regression model. A P value of less than 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
