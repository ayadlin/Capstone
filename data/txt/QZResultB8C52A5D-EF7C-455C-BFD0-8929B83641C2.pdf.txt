When Medical Evidence Alone Is
Simply Not Enough
Michael A. O’Donnell, MD

With the alacrity of tax accountants armed with enumerated spreadsheets, authors Messing and colleagues
demonstrate that US urologists (at least from 1997-2004) have not come to terms with the use of prophylactic,
single-dose, immediate, intravesical chemotherapy after transurethral surgery for nonmuscle-invasive (superficial) bladder cancer.1 Despite class-1A medical evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials published
during the time of this analysis showing consistent and substantial reduction in cancer recurrence for patients
treated with this therapy, <1% of US urologists had incorporated this medical evidence into clinical practice.
Can these results be believed? And if so, how can they be explained, and more importantly, rectified?
Supporting the authors’ contention of low chemotherapy use from their detailed methodological analyses
of MEDSTAT and Medicare databases, independent surveys of US urologists made during these years provide
strong validation. A survey of 105 US urologists published in 2003, representing primarily community-based
practitioners, reported that only 2% of respondents would use any intravesical chemotherapy after transurethral
resection of first-time, low-grade, noninvasive bladder cancer.2 A more robust survey of 760 US urologists published in 2005 showed that 40% did not routinely give any adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy (single dose or a
protracted course), with 25% reporting they believed that it does not reduce the risk of recurrence.3 Furthermore, in a large 1100-patient trial of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) plus interferon that enrolled from 1998
to 2000, <4% of patients were found to have received a single postoperative chemotherapy dose, even among
the >300 patients who had first-time papillary bladder cancers.4
The authors have suggested several explanations for the phenomenon of poor use of this therapy among
US urologists, including poor dissemination of knowledge and lack of advocacy. Among the 5 controlled studies
published from 1994 to 1999, none had been performed in the United States, and 3 involved an agent, epirubicin, unfamiliar and unavailable to US urologists. Furthermore, the US bladder cancer guidelines published in
1999 by the American Urological Association (AUA) specifically omitted any recommendation or reference to
single-dose, immediate, postoperative chemotherapy.5 Although the European Association of Urology (EAU)
first advocated this treatment in its 2002 guidelines, it was not until 2004 that a meta-analysis of immediate
postoperative chemotherapy was published, providing the first major impetus to its use.6 Thus, it is quite
plausible that US urologists were ill-prepared and unfamiliar with the medical evidence during the time of the
authors’ analysis.

However, other potential hindrances involving
safety and logistical concerns could further have contributed to meager US urologist use of this treatment during
this time. The low molecular weight alkylating agent, thiotepa, was still commonly used by US urologists, with the
widespread recognition that major absorption with resultant myelosuppression was a clearly identified risk, especially in the setting of recent transurethral bladder tumor
resection.7 Thiotepa had also not been found to be effective as a single-dose postoperative agent in randomized trials.8 The other 2 commonly used drugs, mitomycin and
doxorubicin (Adriamycin) were known to cause some toxicity as well as rare severe tissue reactions upon extravasation from the bladder, as might occur after bladder tumor
resection.9 Add to this the logistical difficulty in getting
chemotherapy to the operating or recovery room, the
drug wastage that could occur if unexpected bleeding or
perforation were found, and uncertain reimbursement
concerns about billing under these settings and the impetus to maintain the status quo could well have discouraged
widespread use.
The real question is whether these obstacles are surmountable and how best to translate this medical evidence
into clinical practice. It appears that advocacy and codified guidelines can and do make a big difference. In
Europe, the implementation of EAU bladder cancer
guidelines in 2002 has been largely, but still not totally,
successful. A total of 244 consultant urologists from Flanders and Belgium were surveyed approximately 3 years after the first EAU Bladder Cancer Guidelines were
published. Single-dose instillation of chemotherapy was
acknowledged as a routine practice by 62% and 57% of
urologists treating low- and intermediate-risk bladder
tumors, respectively.10 In England, 82% of nearly 300
urologists surveyed in 2005 reported the use of mitomycin
for single-dose immediate postoperative use. However, of
these urologists using mitomycin, <4% administered the
drug within the first 6 hours at a time shown to be the
most effective, whereas 64% dosed between 6 and 24
hours, and 32% dosed after 24 hours, at a point considered generally ineffective.11 This suggests logistical concerns remain problematic. Recently, a methodology for
on-site mitomycin preparation has been reported and
demonstrated to allow 177 of 210 (84%) patients to be
treated in the operating room.12 An organized strategy for
cooperative planning among nurses, pharmacists, and surCancer

geons has also been proposed to overcome logistical difficulties to facilitate early postoperative treatment.13
It remains to be seen whether US urologists can
effectively catch up with their European colleagues. The
newly published 2007 AUA Bladder Cancer Guidelines
now includes single-dose mitomycin as an ‘‘option’’ for
any patient who presents with an abnormal growth on the
urothelium but who has not yet been diagnosed with
bladder cancer, and as a ‘‘recommendation’’ for a patient
with small-volume, low-grade, papillary noninvasive bladder cancer.14 These guidelines are already being widely
promulgated among US urologists. However, there
remains some reticence to advocate more sweeping use
because of the lack of long-term benefit, especially with
regard to alteration in disease progression. By contrast,
the new 2008 EAU Bladder Cancer Guidelines go so far
as to recommend 1 dose of immediate postoperative
chemotherapy as initial treatment for all patients with
non-muscle invasive disease, plus additional therapy (further chemotherapy or BCG immunotherapy) for those at
intermediate or high risk for recurrence or progression.15
The arguments advanced by Messing et al about the
economic benefits to be gained by immediate postoperative chemotherapy should be expected to add further fuel
to broader US use. Bladder cancer is the most expensive
cancer to treat from diagnosis until death, largely because
of its highly recurrent and often nonlethal, enduring nature.16 Indeed, it is estimated that there are over 500,000
patients currently surviving with this cancer, costing the
US healthcare system in excess of $3 billion annually.
With the aging US population, bladder cancer incidence
continues to grow. The conservatively estimated annual
savings of $20-25 million by Messing for new low-risk
cases treated with immediate therapy could multiply severalfold by broadening this practice to intermediate- and
high-risk cases and to the more predominant recurrent
cases.
The impetus for change probably can and must
come from multiple sources. Although physician awareness and advocacy will undoubtedly push forward, already
there is a growing movement to measure and report evidence-based physician and hospital behavior. With strong
class-A medical evidence supporting its clinical use, metrics to reward appropriate and discourage inappropriate
denial of immediate postoperative chemotherapy may
well be in the future. Especially as this affects the bottom

line of healthcare cost, third-party payers and Medicare
are expected to take notice. Implementation, of course,
must be flexible enough to provide for patient-specific
exceptions and facilitate the logistical aspects of use and
reimbursement. One notable potential problem is the lack
of any Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs
for immediate postoperative use, a situation already
encouraging major pharmaceutical industry interest.
This report by Messing and colleagues does much to
demonstrate that medical evidence alone is not always sufficient to enable the efficient implementation of changes
in clinical practice. Practice patterns, information dissemination, advocacy programs, guidelines, logistics, and reimbursement policies must all synchronize to promote
effective change. The recognition of these important elements must be understood and acknowledged to translate
medical evidence into clinical practice. Tracking postoperative bladder chemotherapy use in the years to come could
well provide further important insights into this process.
