BACKGROUND. It is unclear whether intensive chemotherapy is beneficial to
patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) if they are aged 60 years.

METHODS. The authors studied 160 patients with a median age of 67 years who
received intensive chemotherapy for MDS or AML with cytosine arabinoside and
an anthracycline.

RESULTS. At diagnosis, cytogenetic analysis was available in 146 patients. Karyotype was normal in 78 patients and abnormal in 68 patients. Of the abnormal
karyotypes, 32 belonged to the high-risk category, ie, they involved either 3
chromosomes or chromosome 7. Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 94
patients (56%). CR rates were 70% among the patients who had a normal karyotype, 69% among the patients who had an abnormal (noncomplex) karyotype,
but only 46% among the patients ho had a high-risk karyotype. The median sur-

n elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the role of intensive chemotherapy
has not been defined clearly, because many trials exclude patients
aged > 60 years.1 However, the incidence of AML strongly increases
with age. At diagnosis, the median age of patients with AML is
approximately 70 years. In individuals aged > 65 years, the incidence is almost 10 times higher than in the younger population
(12.2 per 100,000 vs 1.3 per 100.000).2
A few studies have demonstrated an unfavorable outcome of
chemotherapy in elderly patients with AML.3–7 Chemotherapy
presents several problems for these patients, including increased
treatment toxicity, a high rate of infectious and hemorrhagic complications, and an increased proportion of incomplete remissions. In
addition, AML in the elderly often is associated with cytogenetic

findings that portend a poor prognosis.8–10 With
these prospects, prolonged hospitalization and seriously impaired quality of life associated with intensive chemotherapy may not be acceptable.
To evaluate the role of intensive chemotherapy
further in elderly patients with AML and high-risk
MDS, we performed a unicenter trial for patients
aged 60 years. In patients with MDS, chemotherapy
was started because of severe cytopenia, increasing
medullary blast count, or transformation to AML.
Some patients fulfilled more than 1 criterion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between 1991 and 2004, 160 patients aged 60 years
were entered into the trial. The median age was 66
years (range, 60–77 years). The trial included 94 men
and 66 women. A diagnosis of MDS according to the
French-American-British (FAB) classification was
made if patients met the following criteria: 1) peripheral cytopenia despite normal or increased bone
marrow cellularity, 2) morphologic evidence of
dysplasia in blood and bone marrow, and 3) absence
of exclusion criteria (vitamin B12 and folic acid
deficiency; antibody-mediated cytopenia; paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria; hypersplenism; solid tumors; chronic inflammatory diseases; metabolic disorders; and bone marrow toxicity through drugs,
alcoholism, or occupational toxins). At the time of
entry into the study, 32 patients had MDS (3 patients
had refractory anemia [RA], 7 patients had RA with
excess blasts [RAEB], and 22 patients had RAEB in
transformation [RAEB-T]). AML was diagnosed in 128
patients. The median blast count among the patients
with AML was 75%. In 46 patients, AML had developed from MDS, including 2 patients who had RA,
3 patients who had RA with ringed sideroblasts
(RARS), 8 who had RAEB, 32 patients who had RAEBT, and 1 patient who had chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia. Patients who had AML-M3 were not
included in the study.
Patient characteristics with regard to median
blood counts, medullary blasts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), organomegaly, and clinical symptoms are
summarized in Table 1.
The median time from diagnosis of MDS or AML
to initiation of chemotherapy was 7 days (range,
from 1 day to 41 months). In the MDS group, the
median time from diagnosis to initiation of chemotherapy was 1 month (range, from 8 days to 21
months); in the de novo AML group, the median
time from diagnosis to initiation of chemotherapy
was 6 days (range, from 1 day to 25 months); and, in

the group of patients who had AML that derived
from MDS, the median time from diagnosis to initiation of chemotherapy was 8 days (range, from 1 day
to 41 months). The differences were not statistically
significant.
Some patients had received previous treatment
with low-dose chemotherapy, hydroxyurea, or investigational drugs. The decision to proceed with intensive chemotherapy was made by the attending
physician, whose judgment was influenced by a good
performance score of the patient, lack of concomitant nonhematologic disorders, and the patient’s
wish to be treated. The study was approved by the
ethics committee, and written informed consent was
obtained from all patients.

Cytomorphology
Cytomorphologic assessment was based on MayGrunwald-Giemsa, peroxidase, and a-naphthyl-esterase stains. Subtypes of MDS and AML were diagnosed according to FAB criteria.11,12
Cytogenetic Studies
The karyotype was classified as abnormal if aberrations were identified in <3 chromosomes and as
high-risk either if 3 chromosomes were involved or
if chromosome 7 was involved. Chromosome studies
were performed on bone marrow aspirates. TrypsinGiemsa-banded metaphases that were obtained from
direct preparations and from 24- or 72-hour cultures
without added mitogens were examined. In each
patient, 20 metaphases were karyotyped and classified according to the International System for
Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature.13 Karyotype at
diagnosis was available in 146 patients and was normal in 78 patients. Noncomplex aberrations were
identified in 36 patients, with 5q, inv16, and trisomy 8 the most frequently identified anomalies.
Aberrations of the high-risk category were identified
in 32 patients. The frequency of chromosomal abnormalities, including high-risk karyotypes, did not
differ between MDS, de novo AML, and AML deriving from MDS. Involvement of chromosome 7 was
observed in 17 patients.
Chemotherapy Regimens
Induction chemotherapy with cytosine arabinoside
(Ara-C) (200 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] on Days 1–5)
and idarubicin (12 mg/m2 IV on Days 1–3) was given
to 129 patients. Thioguanine (100 mg/m2 orally on
Days 3–9) was included in 25 patients, and etoposide
(100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 3, and 5) was included in 6
patients.
A second course of idarubicin plus an increased
dose of Ara-C (1000 mg/m2 on Days 1–5) were administered as consolidation chemotherapy. In patients
in ongoing complete remission (CR), maintenance
therapy with low-dose, subcutaneous Ara-C (100 mg/
m2 monthly on Days 1–5) plus oral idarubicin (10
mg/m2 monthly on Days 1–3) was planned for up to
3 years.
Supportive Care
Prophylactic treatment against infections included
oral antibiotics (ciprofloxacin 1000 mg daily or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol 320 mg daily plus colistine 384 mg daily) and antifungal prophylaxis with
oral amphotericin B (2000 mg daily). Red cell transfusions were given to keep the hemoglobin level
above 8 g/dL. The objective of platelet transfusions

347

was to maintain a platelet count >10,000 lL to
20,000 lL. Febrile patients were treated empirically
with broad-spectrum antibiotics and IV amphotericin
B if they had a suspected fungal infection. Hematopoietic growth factors were not given.

Criteria for Response and Definition of Recurrence
A CR, as defined according to International Working
Group criteria,14,15 required the presence of a morphologically normal bone marrow as well as
neutrophils >1.0 3 109/L and platelets >100.000/lL
in the peripheral blood. Relapse was defined as >4%
blasts in the bone marrow aspirate or extramedullary
leukemic infiltrates in patients who previously
achieved CR after induction or consolidation therapy.
Early death was attributable to treatment complications within 30 days from the start of induction
chemotherapy. A nonresponse was defined as the
failure to achieve CR or partial remission in patients
who survived 30 days of treatment.
Statistical Analysis
The product-limit method was used to estimate the
probability of survival, disease-free survival (DFS),
and risk of leukemic transformation. Survival was
measured from the start of induction therapy to the
time of death or last follow-up (March 31, 2005). DFS
was calculated from the date of documented CR to
the time of relapse (MDS or AML) or death without
relapse. Survival curves for different cytogenetic subgroups (normal, abnormal, and high-risk) were compared by using the log-rank test.16 Clinical and
hematologic data from patients at the time of diagnosis were compared using the chi-square test with
Yates correction17 and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Parameters that were predictive of achieving CR were
analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Prognostic
factors that were related to DFS were determined
using the stepwise multivariate regression method of
Cox.18

RESULTS
Induction Therapy
During induction therapy, patients stayed in hospital
for a median of 31 days (range 15–83 days), they
were febrile for a median of 10 days (range, 1–47
days), and they received antibiotic treatment for a
median of 19 days (range, 1–66 days). CR was
obtained in 94 patients (59%), which was somewhat
less than would be expected in a younger patient
population. Eight patients achieved a partial remission (5%), and 42 patients showed no response

(26%). The rate of fatal complications was not excessive: Early death occurred in 16 patients (10%).

Consolidation Therapy
Only 56 of 160 patients received consolidation chemotherapy; because, among 96 patients who achieved
CR, 40 patients had clinical problems, mainly relating to infectious complications, which precluded further chemotherapy. Karyotypes were available for 53
of 56 patients who received consolidation therapy.
The initial karyotype had been normal in 33 patients,
had been abnormal (noncomplex) in 13 patients, and
had shown high-risk features in 7 patients. After consolidation chemotherapy, only 25 patients went on to
receive at least 1 cycle of maintenance chemotherapy
(18 patients with an initially normal karyotype, 6
with abnormal karyotype, and 1 patient with highrisk karyotype anomalies).
Survival
For the entire group of 160 patients, the median survival from the start of induction chemotherapy was
9.5 months (range, from 10 days to 157 months) (Fig.
1). The median survival from diagnosis was 14
months (range, from 1 day to 157 months). Treatment outcome did not differ between the 3 variants
of induction chemotherapy (Table 2). Patients who
achieved CR after induction chemotherapy, as
expected, survived significantly longer than patients

There was no significant difference in treatment
outcomes between patients who had MDS, AML
derived from MDS, or de novo AML. Survival from
the day of diagnosis and survival from the start of
induction chemotherapy were similar in patients
with de novo AML and patients with MDS/AML (see
Table 1). Both measures of survival indicated that the
prognosis was worse for patients with de novo AML
than for patients with primary MDS, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (P 5 .08
and P 5 .09, respectively). DFS also did not differ sig-

nificantly between patients with MDS, MDS/AML,
and de novo AML.

Influence of Karyotype on Treatment Outcome
The pretreatment karyotype influenced the response
to induction chemotherapy. CR was achieved by 70%
of patients who had a normal karyotype, by 69% of
patients who had an abnormal (noncomplex) karyotype, and 46% of patients who had high-risk karyotype anomalies. A partial remission was considered
no response. The difference in CR rate was statistically significant between the high-risk and normal
karyotype groups (P 5 .02) but failed to reach statistical significance between the high-risk and abnormal
(noncomplex) karyotype groups (P 5 .08).
The initial karyotype influenced not only CR
rates but also long-term survival (Fig. 3). This part of
the analysis excluded cases of early death. The median survival was 18 months for patients with a normal karyotype, 6 months for patients with an
abnormal karyotype, and only 4 months for patients
with a high-risk karyotype. Differences were statistically significant between patients with normal
and abnormal (noncomplex) karyotypes (P 5 .0019),
between patients with normal and high-risk karyotypes (P < .00005), and between patients with normal
and all pathologic karyotypes (abnormal plus highrisk; P 5 .001). The difference between abnormal
(noncomplex) and high-risk karyotype was not statis-

349

tically significant (P 5 .15). Regarding high-risk
karyotype anomalies, there was no difference in survival between patients with or without involvement
of chromosome 7 (P 5 .95).
For those patients who achieved CR after induction chemotherapy, the initial karyotype maintained
its importance as a prognostic parameter. Patients
who had a normal karyotype had a relapse rate of
66% and a median survival of 19 months. Patients
who had an abnormal (noncomplex) karyotype had a
recurrence rate of 59% and a median survival of 13
months. There were relapses in 11 of 12 patients
who had high-risk karyotype anomalies, and their
median survival was 11 months. In the latter group,
the only patient who did not develop a relapse died
of infectious complications 4 months after diagnosis.
Among the patients who entered CR, the difference
in survival was statistically significant only between
those with a normal karyotype and those with a
high-risk karyotype (P 5 .03).
The DFS of patients who entered CR was 13
months (range, 1–157 months) for patients with a
normal karyotype, 5 months (range, 1–30 months)
for patients with an abnormal karyotype, and 6
months (range, 1–27 months) for patients with a
high-risk karyotype. The difference was statistically
significant between patients with normal and abnormal (noncomplex) karyotypes (P 5 .01), between
patients with normal and high-risk karyotypes
(P 5 .03), and between patients with normal and all
pathologic karyotypes (P 5 .003).

Auer Rods
In the entire group, we identified 31 patients with
Auer rods. Of these, 25 patients entered CR (86%). Of
129 patients without Auer rods, 69 patients entered
CR (60%; P 5 .008). The different CR rates were not
important for long-term prognosis, because differences in survival and DFS were not statistically significant (DFS: 7 months vs 11 months; P 5 .09;
survival: 9 months vs 11 months; P 5 .41).
Auer rods were detected in 25.6% of patients
with normal karyotype, in 16.7% of patients with
abnormal (noncomplex) karyotypes, and in only 3%
of patients with high-risk karyotype. Because Auer
rods indicate at least some degree of myeloid differentiation, their absence in leukemic cells with extensive chromosomal damage suggests an immature
phenotype.
Multivariate Analysis of Outcome After Chemotherapy

is shown in Table 1. With respect to achieving CR, no

prolonged time from diagnosis to the start of induction therapy (>3 months). For DFS, karyotype, Auer
rods, and time from diagnosis to induction therapy
were identified as independent prognostic factors
(Table 3).

DISCUSSION
The current data suggest that intensive chemotherapy in elderly patients is not necessarily associated
with an excessive risk of early death. In our group of
160 patients with high-risk MDS or AML aged 60
years, the rate of early deaths was similar to that
reported for intensive chemotherapy of de novo AML
in younger patients.19
The important question is whether the survivors
of induction chemotherapy benefit in terms of longterm survival. The answer depends, to a considerable
extent, on cytogenetics. Those patients in our trial
who presented with a high-risk karyotype at the time
of diagnosis derived no survival benefit from chemotherapy compared with best supportive care. Because
there are no outcome data available for best supportive care in AML, we suggest drawing upon patients
with RAEB-T instead. In the Dusseldorf MDS Registry, patients with RAEB-T have a median overall survival of 4 months with best supportive care. The
same overall survival was observed in our AML
patients with karyotype anomalies who received intensive chemotherapy. This unfavorable result was
attributable to a low rate of CR and a high risk of
early recurrence. Our finding that karyotype is an important predictor of response facilitates the appropri-

ate selection of elderly patients for intensive
chemotherapy.
Along with karyotype, other pretreatment variables may contribute to predicting outcome. Our
data confirm that the time from diagnosis to the start
of induction chemotherapy is an important prognostic factor. This was demonstrated previously in a
large trial by the European Organization for the
Research and Treatment of Cancer in which patients
aged 65 years had a shorter median survival with a
wait-and-see strategy than with induction therapy
shortly after diagnosis (11 weeks vs 21 weeks).20 Several groups have reported a trend toward higher CR
rates among patients who were treated during the
MDS phase compared with patients who were treated after the evolution to AML.21,22 The CR rates
were 62.5% and 35%, respectively, according to a
meta-analysis of 370 patients.23
Even if it is started early, cytotoxic treatment
benefits only those patients who enter CR after
induction chemotherapy. This has been observed in
AML patient populations that were not restricted to
the elderly, as in the German AML Cooperative
Group 1992 trial, for example, which included
patients who ranged in age from 16 years to 76
years.24 Our data show that this conclusion also
applies to patients aged >60 years. We were able to
induce CR in 59% of our patients, and 25% of those
who achieved a complete response maintained
remission for at least 2 years.
Irrespective of whether patients entered CR after
induction chemotherapy, our data show that the survival of patients with MDS, AML from MDS, and de
novo AML strongly depends on the initial karyotype.
In our study, there was a small group of 14 elderly
patients with MDS or AML who had a normal karyotype and achieved long-term remission, which lasted
from 3 years to 10 years. Conversely, among 34
patients who survived for 2 years, only 2 patients
had a high-risk karyotype. Those patients died after
25 months and 26 months, respectively, from recurrent disease.
Although several studies have demonstrated the
influence of karyotype on response to induction therapy, chance of survival, and risk of relapse in patients
with AML,25–35 few studies specifically have examined the influence of karyotype anomalies in elderly
patients.36 It appears that only 20% to 30% of older
patients achieve CR when they have a low performance status and/or an abnormal or even high-risk
karyotype.7,37–39
Because elderly patients with high-risk karyotype
anomalies do not benefit from intensive chemotherapy, other approaches must be tried. Oral etoposide

plus idarubicin has been studied in elderly patients
(median age, 69 years) in patients with high-risk
AML, but none of the patients achieved CR, and the
median overall survival was only 100 days.40 Recently, demethylating agents such as decitabine41–43
or 5-azacytidine44,45 and inhibitors of histone deacetylases such as valproic acid46–49 have produced
promising results. Patients can be treated in an outpatient setting and experience fewer side effects. It is
noteworthy that these agents did not produce CR
rates or overall survival that were inferior compared
with intensive chemotherapy in patients who had
high-risk karyotype anomalies.
