ABSTRACT
Whereas cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II) is a first-line medicine to
treat solid cancerous tumors, it often causes serious side effects. New medicines
that have an equivalent or even better therapeutic effect but with free or less
side effects than cisplatin are highly anticipated in cancer therapy. Recent reports
revealed that Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) possesses hepatoprotective activity in
addition to anticancer. In this study, we wanted to know whether AC enhances
chemo-sensitivity of cisplatin and/or alleviates cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity, as
well as the underlying mechanisms thereof. Our results indicated that AC inhibited
proliferation of line-1 lung carcinoma cells and rescued hepatic HepG2 cells from
cisplatin-induced cell death in vitro. The fact is that AC and cisplatin synergized to
constrain growth of line-1 lung carcinoma cells in BALB/cByJ mice. Quantitative
real-time PCR further revealed that AC promoted expression of apoptosis-related
genes, while it decreased expression of NF-κB and VEGF in tumor tissues. In liver,
AC  reduced cisplatin-induced liver dysfunctions, liver inflammation and hepatic
apoptosis in addition to body weight restoration. In summary, AC is able to increase
cisplatin efficacy by triggering expression of apoptosis-related genes in line-1 lung
cancer cells as well as to protect liver from tissue damage by avoiding cisplatininduced hepatic inflammation and cell death.

INTRODUCTION

non-enzymatic molecule glutathione (GSH) [18, 19]. Liver,
the key detoxification organ, is vulnerable to oxidative
stress. Because the pathogenicity of the cisplatin-induced
hepatotoxicity has not yet been clearly elucidated, the
development of proper adjuvant treatments to prevent or
alleviate the cisplatin-induced hepatopathy is hampered.
Given that the cisplatin-induced liver injury is strongly
associated with free radicals, a new strategy combing both
cisplatin and antioxidant might be worthwhile to assess for
reduction of the toxic side effects in liver [20, 21].
Antrodia cinnamomea (AC), the genus Antrodia
(Polyporaceae), is a photophobic parasitic fungus growing
in inner cavities of Cinnamomum kanehirai, which is a
Taiwan endemic species [22]. Taiwanese have a long
history to use AC as a medicine for several body disorders,
such as diarrhea, intoxication, hypertension, stomachache,
inflammation, etc [23]. Recent studies further revealed
that AC has some hepatoprotective effects, for example,
inhibition of viral antigen activity of hepatitis viruses
[24], reduction of oxidative stress of alcohol-induced
liver diseases, and counteraction of liver fibrosis of the
TAA-induced liver injury [25]. AC was also reported able
to protect liver cells from free radical-induced oxidative
stresses through the Nrf-2 activation and up-regulation
of the MAP kinase-mediated antioxidant genes [26, 27].
Moreover, AC was reported able to inhibit proliferation
of head and neck cancer cells [28], migration of leukemia
cells [29, 30], as well as help characterize cancer stem
cells of hepatocellular carcinoma [31].
In this report, we aimed to interpret the mechanisms
of the AC protection effects on the cisplatin-induced
oxidative stress and liver injury, as well as the inhibition
effect of AC in lung tumor growth upon the cisplatin-based
therapy in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that not only
does AC protect hepatic cells but also act in synergy with
cisplatin to promote lung carcinoma cell death. AC was
further demonstrated able to reduce oxidative stress
in vitro. Finally, we conclude that AC in conjunction with
cisplatin inhibits growth of line-1 lung carcinoma cells and
attenuates cisplatin-induced cachexia, liver damage and
inflammation in mice.

Lung cancer known for its high relapse and low
cure rate is the leading cancer, accounting for 19.5% of all
cancer death [1], wherein the non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) takes up 75–80% with a five-year survival
rate of 10–15%. The non-resectable lung cancer (~80%
of NSCLC) is even notorious for its bad prognosis. The
mean survival time of 9–23 months is contingent upon
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations
and with/without EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
treatment [2, 3]. Though a subset of patients with specific
EGFR mutations benefits from the EGFR targeted therapy
[4, 5], for most patients the disease one way or the other
advances as result of acquiring drug resistance [6].
Surgery, chemotherapy and target therapy are
mainstream cancer treatments. In chemotherapy, the
platinum-based chemotherapy remains one of the major
choices for NSCLC. Cisplatin, a platinum-containing
compound, is effective on a variety of solid tumors, such
as lung, ovarian, malignant pleural mesothelioma and head
and neck cancers [7, 8]. The fact is that cisplatin-based
adjuvant chemotherapy has been estimated with high
overall survival and/or disease-free survival rate in five
large-scale clinical trials over 4584 fully NSCLC resected
patients [9]. Both disease-free and overall survival rates
of the NSCLC resected patients were increased by coadministration of cisplatin and vinorelbine [10]. Pepe
et al. [11] suggested that elderly surgical NSCLC-removal
patients treated with vinorelbine along with less total
cisplatin chemotherapy would improve overall prognosis.
Therefore, the cisplatin-based chemotherapy should not
be completely withheld from elderly patients. Although
younger patients could tolerate more aggressive cisplatin
chemotherapy, while the one-year survival rate was not
significantly increased by such an aggressive treatment
[12]. While the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin can be
improved through dose expansion, serious non-specific
cytotoxicity such as nephrotoxicity [13], ototoxicity [14]
and hepatotoxicity [15] often arise. Nephrotoxicity is
the most common dose-limiting cytoxicity, which looms
slowly but predictably upon repeated exposure. Cisplatin
accumulates in kidney higher than in other organs due
to relatively dense mediated transport system in kidney,
where from about one third of patients complicate with the
cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity [13, 16]. Hepatotoxicity
is also very common in patients under high-dose cisplatin
treatment [15]. Poor outcomes such as low survival rate,
bad tumor responses, deteriorated life quality, and ill
toxicity in advanced NSCLC patients underline urgent
needs for better treatments [17].
Oxidative stress has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Oxidative
stress is also known positively correlated to reactive
oxygen species (ROS) but negatively to antioxidant
defense systems, for example, antioxidant enzymes and

RESULTS
A. cinnamomea protects hepatic cells, inhibits
lung carcinoma cells and alleviates oxidative
stress
To make sure whether AC differentially protects
hepatic cells but inhibits lung carcinoma cells, we examined
cell viability and survival rate in the presence of AC by
MTS assay. For this experiment, both the mouse line-1
lung carcinoma cell line and the human hepatic HepG2 cell
line were used, and results were compared to evaluate the
differential cytotoxicity of AC. HepG2 is an immortalized
human hepatoma cell line that is frequently used in
25742

hepatocyte-function-related studies [32]. Cells were treated
with various concentrations of AC (1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/
mL) for 48 h, where the number of line-1 lung carcinoma
cells declined significantly while that of HepG2 cells had no
change (Figure 1). To know if cisplatin synergizes with AC to
reduce cell viability, comparison assays were performed. In
terms of cell viability and proliferation, HepG2 cells treated
with cisplatin or/and AC resulted in quite distinct results as
shown in Figure 1: AC does not inhibit the viability of HepG2
cells, while cisplatin has strong cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells
in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, AC can reverse the
cisplatin-induced cell death also in a dose-dependent manner
(p < 0.05). On the other hand, both cisplatin and AC do
inhibit line-1 lung carcinoma cells. When both cisplatin and
AC were administrated together, a synergistic suppression
resulted (p < 0.05, Figure 1). Accordingly, we suggest that
cisplatin/AC has an inhibitory effect on tumor growth (line-1
cells); AC has a protective effect on hepatic cells, particularly
the cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity.
To conclude the above findings, we further
examined the effects of AC on different primary
cultured cells BALB/cByJ mice cell line and human
A549 lung carcinoma cell line with/without addition of
cisplatin. The results of BALB/cByJ mice cells indeed

are consistent with those of human hepatic HepG2 cells
(Supplementary Figure S2A). In contrast, the A549 cell
line, which is cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells [33, 34],
displayed no observable cytotoxity under the doses of
1.25–5 μM cisplatin versus the presence/absence of AC
(Supplementary Figure S2B). As a result, we considered
that the line-1 cell line is a better testing cell model
than A549 in this experiment to reflect the true antitumorigenesis/liver-protection effect of AC.
The anti-oxidative activity of AC was subsequently
determined using ferrous ion chelating assay, DPPH radical
scavenging assay and superoxide-anion scavenging assay.
As shown in Figure 2A, the linear formation of ferrous and
ferrozine complexes when AC was added indicates that AC
can chelate irons in a dose-dependent manner, although
the iron chelating activity of AC is not as good as that
of EDTA. In Figure 2B, AC presents DPPH scavenging
activity also in a dose-dependent manner, wherein the
scavenging rates are 66.88% and 36.22% for AC at 5 and
1.25 mg/mL, respectively. The anti-oxidation activity of
AC is comparable to that of Vitamin C. In Figure 2C, AC
has a superior superoxide radicals quenching rate to gallic
acid (2.5 mg/mL, 16.36%). Their quenching rates are
80.15%, 73.43%, and 61.94% in the presence of 5, 2.5, and

1.25 mg/mL of AC, respectively. LPS-induced RAW 264.7
cells were also subjected to NO inhibition assay, whereby
nitrite accumulates. When AC (5 mg/mL) was included
in the NO production system, the accumulation of nitrite
significantly decreased (Figure 3A), where cytotoxicity was
not detected (Figure 3B).
As a result, AC that possesses several desired
biological activities is confirmed: AC selectively kills lung
carcinoma cells without harming immortalized hepatic
cells; AC has strong anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation

activities. AC is a suitable agent to improve conventional
chemotherapeutics in cancer treatment.

A dose of 2.5 mg/kg cisplatin was intraperitoneally
injected into BALB/cByJ mice xenografted with murine
lung carcinoma line-1 cells. As shown in Figure 4A
& 4B, tumor volume and tumor weight in the T+cis
group decrease significantly by 52.96% and 49.80%,
respectively, when compared to those of the T group. Mice
that received a combination of 300 mg/kg AC and cisplatin
reduced tumor volume and tumor weight by 79.82% and
69.36%, respectively (Figure 4A & 4B). Co-administration
of AC and cisplatin apparently exhibits a synergistic
antitumor activity.
To understand whether the synergistic effect is as
result of modulating apoptotic signaling pathways, the
gene expression of Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2 and Bax)
and caspases (3, 8 and 9) was examined by real time PCR
(Figure 4C). The mRNA level of Bcl-2 decreased after
treating the tumor-bearing mice with cisplatin, while that
of Bax increased instead (Figure 4C). The set of testing
animals co-administrated with AC and cisplatin showed

significantly decreased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 but increased
pro-apoptotic Bax when compared with those treated with
cisplatin alone. The gene expression of caspases 3, 8 and
9 increased significantly in the T+cis group. Mice that
received a combination of AC and cisplatin did not change,
but maintain an above-average gene level of caspases 3,
8 and 9. Thus, our results suggest that AC can maintain or
enhance antitumor activity of cisplatin.
It has been well documented that cancer cells
regularly express NF-κB and VEGF [35, 36]. NF-κB is
a redox-sensitive transcription factor sensing oxidative
stresses [37]. We found that the gene expression level
of NF-κB increased in the T group, thus suggesting
a high oxidative stress in tumor. The mice treated with
cisplatin did not show decreased NF-κB in contrast to
those co-administrated with AC and cisplatin (Figure 4D).
Tumor inoculation would normally induce expression of
angiogenic factor VEGF. The mice treated with cisplatin
showed reduced VEGF; those co-administrated with

result, AC not only has an antineoplastic activity but also
carry an antioxidant activity.

group. Tumor inoculation would cause weight loss;
cisplatin however aggravates the weight loss. The body
weight loss in the T+cis+AC group is about 6.48%, while
the cisplatin-induced body weight loss is considerably
lessened with the treatment of AC (p < 0.05, Figure 5A),
ascertaining that AC alleviates the cisplatin-induced
weight loss in tumor-bearing mice.
AC that reduces the cisplatin-induced hepato­
toxicity was further explored by measuring liver tissue
weight, histopathological change and serum biochemical
parameters in the mice xenografted with line-1 lung
carcinoma cells. As shown in Figure 5B, the liver
weights are 1.65 ± 0.14 and 1.41 ± 0.05 g in the vehicle
and T groups, respectively. Tumor inoculation seems to
have no effect on liver weight change, whereas cisplatin

Body weight loss has been used to index the extent
of tumor-induced cachexia. As shown in Figure 5A, after
a 18-day cisplatin treatment the body weight decreases
12.96% in mice (p < 0.05), while the body weight remains
leveling off in the group receiving cis+AC (p > 0.05),
suggesting that AC can restore the cisplatin-induced
weight loss. The body-weight loss was estimated about
4.20% in the T group, as opposed to 18.12% in the T+cis

the cis and T+cis mice. Likewise, with the AC treatment
the gene expression of caspases 3 and 9 kept at the basal
level in the T+cis+AC mice (p < 0.05, Figure 6B). Cisplatin
thus causes liver damage through induction of liver cell
apoptosis, while AC can reverse the cisplatin-induced
liver cell death. Taken together, AC is able to suppress
hepatotoxicity, inflammation and apoptosis in the liver
tissues of the tumor-bearing mice upon cisplatin treatment.

administration does cause decreases of liver weight
by 32.34% and 27.45% in the T+cis and cis groups,
respectively. In contrast, the decreases of liver weight are
10.24% and 13.56% in the cis+AC and T+cis+AC groups,
respectively. Clearly, the mice groups receiving cisplatinAC significantly show lesser liver weight loss than those
receiving cisplatin only (p < 0.05, Figure 2B). As a result,
AC is able to rescue the cisplatin-induced liver weight loss.
Liver damage often manifests such symptoms as
necrotic hepatocytes, inflammatory cellular infiltration,
cytoplasmic degeneration, and hepatocytes vacuolation. As
shown in Figure 5D & 5G, the mice that received cisplatin
treatment (the cis and T+cis groups) show severe bleeding,
neutrophil inflitration and hepatocytes vacuolation as
compare with control and T groups (Figure 5C & 5F). The
mice that received both cisplatin and AC, however, show
minor hepatic damage (Figure 5E & 5H). AC significantly
alleviates the cisplatin-induced liver damage. Histological
abnormalities also coincide with the increased levels
of liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) in the cisplatin-treated mice. The
mice treated with cisplatin for 18 days displayed elevated
levels of serum ALT and AST in the cis and T+cis groups,
indicating that cisplatin per se causes liver dysfunction in
tumor-bearing mice (Table 1). With the AC treatment the
serum levels of AST and ALT reversed in the cis+AC and
T+cis+AC groups (Table 1). Thus, AC not only alleviates
the cisplatin-induced liver dysfunction but also protects
liver from damage.
We further investigated whether AC has antiinflammatory activity in liver, which indexes the extent
of the cisplatin-induced tissue damage. In the cisplatintreated mice, the level of iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α in liver
significantly increased. However, with administration of AC
the level of these cytokines in liver decreased significantly
(p < 0.05, Figure 6A). Expression of the apoptotic-related
caspase genes 3 and 9 (except caspase 8) was increased in

DISCUSSION
To maximize tumor cytotoxicity but minimize
chemotherapy-induced normal tissue damage has long
been the primary task in cancer chemotherapeutic research.
Many studies have reported that some natural products
carry desired properties to meet this goal [38]. AC is one
of examples able to inhibit free radical-induced oxidative
stresses [26, 27] as well as to strengthen anti-tumor effects
of conventional chemotherapy [28–30]. While a plethora
of biological activities for AC were reported before [39],
the hepatoprotection and lung cancer adjuvant effects,
however, had never been reported.
The free radical-induced oxidative stress is now
realized to play a role in the initiation and progression
of tumors [40]. Researchers are looking for substances
with high anti-ROS potentials, because they may stand
a chance to be developed into medicines for chronic
inflammatory disease and cancer. AC that blocks formation
of oxidative stress and cell apoptosis is likely due to its
high levels of flavonoids, terpinoids and polyphenolics
[41]. Antroquinonol and antcin C, two active compounds
in AC, have been shown to suppress NO and ROS in lipid
peroxidation [26, 27]. In this study, we found that hot
water extracts of AC show high level of polysaccharides,
which inhibit both production of NO in the LPS-stimulated
RAW264.7 macrophages and generation of superoxide
and DPPH radicals.

Unlike cisplatin, of which its cytotoxicity is
indiscriminable between normal and cancerous cells, AC,
however, has no harm to normal cells. AC has been examined
with no subchronic oral toxicity in BALB/c mice [42]; we
also tested AC in three different dosages (350, 700 and 1400
mg/kg BW/day) in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (10 rats/

dose) for 90 consecutive days, during which we observed
no mortality and detectable toxicity (data not shown). The
repeat-dose toxicology for AC is yet to be performed, while
its repeat dose in SD rats was estimated > 1,400 mg/kg
BW. In this study, oral administration of AC significantly
reduced tumor growth and promoted the cisplatin efficacy

in line-1 cell-inoculated BALB/cByJ mice. AC also reduced
inflammatory responses and formation of new blood vessels
in tumor tissues, likely by down-regulating NF-κB and
VEGF. Cisplatin and AC likely synergize in several ways
through increasing pro-apoptotic Bax, decreasing antiapoptotic Bcl-2 as well as overexpressing caspase genes 3, 8
and 9 to protect mice from the challenge of line-1 tumor cells.
The combination of natural agents and chemotherapy
is getting popular in cancer therapy. One example is
that curcumin, a potent radiosesitizer, supplements the
expression of the radiation-induced prosurvival genes in
prostate cancer patients [43]. An ideal chemo-preventing
agent presumbably balances both chemosensitization
and chemotherapeutic toxicity. In addition to promoting
generation of ROSs, cisplatin, which non-selectively
crosslinks intra- and inter-strands of DNAs [44, 45], gives
rise to several severe side effects in patients. Given that
cisplatin would accumulate in liver and kidney resulting
strong hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity [46], its clinical
use is thus limited. Here, we found that the AC coadministration not only prevents cisplatin-induced cachexia
but also restores body weight/liver size to normal. AC was
further demonstrated to alleviate the cisplatin-induced liver
dysfunction, liver inflammation and hepatic apoptosis,
suggesting that AC is promising to act as a hepaticprotective
agent for patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy [47].
In conclusion, our results evidence that AC is a
potent adjuvant, which alleviates oxidative stress, augments
antitumor efficacy of cisplatin, and protect patients from
cisplatin-induced cachexia and hepatotoxicity.

modifications [49]. Briefly, the mycelia of AC were air
dried and extracted with boiling water (at a ratio of 1:20,
w/v) for 6 h. The extract liquid and mycelia precipitate
were seperated by continuous high speed centrifugation.
The suspension was filtered under suction to take out the
insoluble matter. The filtrate was mixed with four volumes
of ethanol (95%) and permitted to stand overnight to
precipitate crude extract, in which polysaccharide is the
major component. After 3890 × g centrifugation for 30
min to remove the supernatant, the crude extract referred
to aqueous AC mycelial extract was dissolved in water
and was stored at room temperature for use. The total
sugar content of the AC extract was determined and the
concentration of polysaccharide is 4.00 ± 0.80 mg/g.

(3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy­
phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) assay is
a colorimetric assay based on the ability of viable cells to
change from soluble yellow tetrazolium salt to blue formazan
crystals. Line-1 and HepG2 cells (0.5 × 104 cells/ml)
were first pretreated with varying concentrations of AC
and cisplatin for 48 h. After drug treatment, cells were
washed with incubation buffer, collected by centrifugation,
and then suspended in the incubation buffer, containing
0.5 mg/ml MTS for 4 h. After MTS treatment, cells were
collected by centrifugation, and then suspended in DMSO
for 10 min to thoroughly dissolve the dark blue crystals.
The absorbency at a wavelength of 490 nm was measured
by spectrophotometer. The cell viability was determined
by  comparing the results with the absorbency of the
untreated cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture

Nitric oxide assay

Line-1 cells from the BALB/cByJ alveolar lung
carcinoma (provided by Dr. John Yuhas) were adapted to
tissue culture [48]. Line-1 cells were cultured in RPMI
Medium 1640 (Gibco, New York, USA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). HepG2 cells (human
hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) and RAW264.7 cells
(Murine macrophage cell line) were obtained from the
Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu,
Taiwan). HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, 1%
non-essential amino acids (NEAA) (Gibco), and 1%
streptomycin-penicillin (100 IU/mL) (Hyclonr, USA).
RAW264.7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were incubated at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for varying times.

The nitric oxide assay was performed as described
previously with slight modifications [50]. After preincubation of RAW264.7 cells (2 × 105 cells/mL) with LPS
(1 μg/μL) and in the presence of varying concentrations of
AC for 18 h, the quantity of nitrite in the culture medium
was measured as an indicator of NO production. Amounts of
nitrite, a stable metabolite of NO, were measured using Griess
reagent (1% sulphanilamide and 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride in 2.5% phosphoric acid). Briefly,
50 μL of cell culture medium was mixed with 50 μL of Griess
reagent. Subsequently, the mixture was incubated at room
temperature for 10 min and the absorbance at 550 nm was
measured in a microplate reader. The fresh culture medium
was used as a blank in every experiment. The quantity of
nitrite was determined from a sodium nitrite standard curve.

Preparation of A. cinnamomea extract

Ferrous ion chelating activity

The mycelia of AC was provided by Chang Gung
Biotechnology Corp. (Taipei, Taiwan). The AC extract
was taken out according to a published method with slight

Ferrous ion chelating activities of AC were
determined by the method of Dinis et al. with slight
modifications [51]. 1.7 ml distiled water, 50 μL of 0.2 mM

Mice and tumor model

FeCl2·4H2O, and 50 μL of 2.5 mg/mL sample solution
were added into test tubes, and the mixture was left at
room temperature for 1 min. 0.2 ml of 5 mM ferrozine
was added, and final color was monitored at 562 nm after
10 min of incubation. In control, water was used in place
of samples. The inhibition percentage of ferrozine–Fe2+
complex formation against blanks containing FeCl2 and
ferrozine was calculated by the formula:

Male BALB/cByJ mice (6–8 weeks) were obtained
from the National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei,
Taiwan, ROC) and housed in a climate controlled room
(12:12 dark-light cycle with a constant room temperature
of 21 ± 1°C). Mice underwent at least 4-day adjustment
to a new environment and diet before treatments were
performed. Food and water were given ad libitum. To
assess the effect of AC on tumor growth and cisplatin
toxicity, mice were divided into groups with matched
weight (Supplementary Figure S1): (1) the control group
receiving normal saline (vehicle group), (2) the group
treated with 2.5 mg/kg cisplatin (cis group), (3) the group
treated with 2.5 mg/kg cisplatin+300 mg/kg AC (cis+AC
group), (4) the line-1 cell-inoculated group receiving
normal saline (T group), (5) the line-1 cell-inoculated
group treated with 2.5 mg/kg cisplatin (T+cis group),
(6) the line-1 cell-inoculated group treated with 2.5
mg/ kg cisplatin plus 300 mg/kg AC (T+cis+AC). Tumors
were induced with a subcutaneous injection of 3 × 105
line-1 cells in 100 μL into the right foot dorsum of
BALB/cByJ mice on Day 0. The control group was
injected with 0.1 ml of a sterile saline solution. Until
the 7th day after tumor inoculation (Day 7), mice were
daily given AC (300mg/kg body weight (BW)) in 200 μL
normal saline via oral gavage until sacrifice (Day 26).
Cisplatin (2.5 mg/kg BW) dissolved in normal saline was
intraperitoneally injected every three day on days 7 after
tumor inoculation. The control group was fed orally with
0.2 ml of a sterile saline solution. Finally, 19 days later
(Day 26), the mice were anesthetized and sacrificed, and
the organs were removed and weighed and stored at 20°C
for further analysis.

% of metal chelating = [1 − (AS:10/AB:10)] × 100
Where AS:10 is absorbance of sample and AB:10 is
absorbance of blank at 10 min reaction time.

DPPH radicals scavenging assay
The radical scavenging ability of AC was assessed by
the method of Shimada et al. with slight modifications [52].
The radical scavenging ability of the extracts was determined
at concentrations of 10 mg/mL in ethanolic DPPH solution
(0.1 mM) (Sigma, Saint Louis, USA). In control, water was
used in place of the sample in which the extract was prepared.
Cuvettes were left in the dark at room temperature for 30 min
and the resulting color was measured spectrophotometrically
at 517 nm against blanks. A decreasing intensity of purple
color was related to higher radical scavenging ability, which
was calculated using the following equation:
DPPH radical scavenging ability= [1− (AS:30/AB:30)] × 100
Where AS:30 is absorbance of the sample and AB:30 is
absorbance of the blank at 30 min reaction time.

Superoxide anion scavenging activity
The NADH/PMS/NBT system was used to
determine the superoxide anion scavenging activity of AC
[53]. Superoxide radicals are generated in PMS–NADH
systems by oxidation of NADH and assay by the reduction
of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) (Sigma). Briefly, 50 μL of
NBT solution (300 μM in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH
7.4) 50 μL NADH solution (936 μM in 100 mM phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4) and 50 μL of sample solution (2.5 mg/ml
in distilled water) were mixed. The reaction was started
by adding 50 μL of phenazine methosulphate (PMS)
solution (120 μM in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4)
to the mixture. The reaction mixture was incubated at
room temperature for 5 min, and the absorbance at 560
nm was measured against blank samples. The decreased
absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated increased
superoxide anion scavenging activity. The NADH/PMS/
NBT solution without sample solution was used as the
control. The percent inhibition of superoxide anion
generation was calculated using the following formula:

Blood sample preparation and analyses
Blood samples (0.5 mL) were obtained immediately
after killing and centrifuged immediately at 1500 × g for
10 minutes. The plasma sample was stored at 4°C within
1 h after collection and diluted 1:100 with distilled water
before measurements for biochemical analysis of ALT and
AST with an autoanalyser (Arkray, Japan). ALT and AST
in the serum of all mice were assayed using the available
kits obtained from Bio Vision Research Products (Avenue,
USA). All assays were made according to the instructions
of the manufacturer.

Histopathological analysis
Tumor and liver tissues were collected from
mice, washed by cold normal saline 3 times, then fixed
in formalin solution 10%, processed, and embedded in
a paraffin film. Sections of 5-μm thick slices of tissues
were prepared. The sections were stained with H &  E.
Microscopic observations were carried out at 200×
magnifications.
