ABSTRACT
The relation between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA load and clinical course of
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is unknown. We assessed EBV
DNA load by quantitative PCR at CLL presentation in mononuclear cells (MNC) of 220
prospective patients that were enrolled and followed-up in two major Institutions.
In 20 patients EBV DNA load was also assessed on plasma samples. Forty-one agematched healthy subjects were tested for EBV DNA load on MNC. Findings were
validated in an independent retrospective cohort of 112 patients with CLL. EBV DNA
load was detectable in 59%, and high (≥2000 copies/µg DNA) in 19% of patients,
but it was negative in plasma samples. EBV DNA load was significantly higher in CLL
patients than in healthy subjects (P < .0001). No relation was found between high
EBV load and clinical stage or biological variables, except for 11q deletion (P = .004),
CD38 expression (P = .003), and NOTCH1 mutations (P = .05). High EBV load led
to a 3.14-fold increase in the hazard ratio of death and to a shorter overall survival
(OS; P = .001). Poor OS was attributable, at least in part, to shorter time-to-firsttreatment (P = .0008), with no higher risk of Richter’s transformation or second
cancer. Multivariate analysis selected high levels of EBV load as independent predictor
of OS after controlling for confounding clinical and biological variables. EBV DNA load
at presentation is an independent predictor of OS in patients with CLL.

INTRODUCTION

life-long infection [1]. Following primary infection, EBV
remains latent in memory B-cells, and confined by EBVspecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the healthy host [2].
However, in patients with profound immunosuppression

due to T-cell function impairment and/or insufficient
antibody production, the infection may induce lytic
replication of the EBV genome and B-cell proliferation.
There is compelling evidence for an etiologic role of
EBV in certain B-cell tumors including endemic Burkitt
lymphoma [3, 4], post-transplant lymphoproliferative
disease [3, 4], HIV-related lymphomas [5], and aggressive
lymphomas of the elderly [6].
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is typically
characterized by immunosuppression already manifest
in the early phases of the disease [7]. Although CLL is
not considered an EBV associated disease, CLL cells
express the complement receptor that serves as EBV
receptor [8]. Pre-clinical data indicate that CLL cells are
difficult to grow after exposure to EBV [9, 10], although
this can be achieved following cytokine activation [11]
or by successful outgrowth of in vivo EBV infected CLL
cells [10]. A recent epidemiological study has reported an
association between EBV infection and risk of developing
CLL [12]. Tarrand et al. [13] reported that LMP1 mRNA
levels were higher in CLL patients than in healthy subjects
(14% vs. 1% of healthy controls), suggesting that EBV
late gene expression does occur at least in a subset of CLL
cells. The same group reported that 38% of CLL patients

had evidence of EBV infection by in situ hybridization
for EBV EBER1, a small noncoding RNA species [14].
Furthermore, EBV infection correlated with accelerated
clinical course, including Richter’s transformation [1416]. Another study showed a relation between latent EBV
infection and CLL cases expressing IGHV4-34 B-cell
receptor configuration [17].
With this study we show that EBV DNA load
obtained from mononuclear cells (MNC) of patients with
CLL at disease presentation is higher than in healthy
controls. Increasing levels of EBV DNA load were
significantly associated to shorter survival.

RESULTS
EBV DNA load in MNC, sorted B-cells and
plasma of patients with CLL, and in MNC of
healthy subjects
EBV DNA load was detectable by real-time PCR
(>0 copies/µg DNA) in 129 of the 220 patients (59%), and
was high (≥2000 copies/µg DNA) in 43 of the 220 patients

(19%). Distribution of EBV DNA levels among patients
was skewed to the right and had a peaked distribution
(skewness 4.906, Kurtosis 33.160 by K–S test). Mean
and median value among patients were 1625 and 192,
respectively (standard deviation 3877; range 0-36449). In
all five patients tested in parallel in sorted B-cells, EBV
DNA load gave similar results to that observed in MNC
(± 30 copies/µg DNA).
Twenty patients (10 with EBV DNA load ≥2000,
and 10 with <2000 copies/µg DNA) were tested for EBV
DNA load on plasma samples. All 20 resulted negative.
Viral load was significantly higher in patients with
CLL than in healthy subjects (median value 0 copies/µg
DNA; range 0-3234; P < .0001), as shown in Figure 1.
EBV DNA load was not associated with any of the
EBV serological patterns (IgG+/IgM- versus IgG+/IgM+
versus IgG-/IgM-).

dichotomous variable, are listed in Table 1. Basically, a
direct association between viral load, CD38 expression (P
= .003), presence of del11q (P = .004), and borderline with
mutations of NOTCH1 (P = .05) was identified. There was
a non-significant trend (P = .09) for older age in patients
with high EBV DNA load.
Overall, 36 of 137 patients (26%) from the learning
set had stereotyped B-cell receptor configuration. Of them,
five had EBV DNA load ≥ 2000 copies/µg DNA, and 31
had EBV DNA < 2000 (22% vs 27%, respectively, P =
.58). Subsets distribution appeared not biased between
patients with high or low EBV DNA load.

Overall survival and time to first treatment
With a median follow-up of 54 months (range 1298), we registered 30 deaths in the learning set. Median
OS has not been reached, and 5-years OS was 83% ±
3% (Figure 2a). Patients with high EBV DNA load had a
significant inferior OS (67% ± 8% at 5-years) than patients
with low EBV DNA load (88% ± 3%, P = .001, Figure
2c). Two-years TTFT was 74% ± 3% (Figure 2b). Patients

and 95% confidence interval were 3,149 (1,486-6,672) and 2,243 (1,378-3,648) for OS and TTFT, respectively.

with high EBV DNA load had a significant inferior 2-years
TTFT (52% ± 7%) than patients with low EBV DNA load
(79% ± 3%, P = .01, Figure 2d). This predictive effect
on TTFT was confirmed when the 171 patients with were
analyzed separately (2-years TTFT 99% ± 1% for patients
with low EBV DNA load versus 90% ± 5% for patients
with high EBV DNA load, P = .001).
No significant difference was observed both in terms
of OS and TTFT in patients with 0 copies/µg of DNA and
those with <2000 copies/µg DNA, suggesting that the
2000 cut-off might be appropriate for defining high values.
No impact of different front-line treatment approaches was
evident on the EBV DNA predictive power.
Among other prognostic variables, univariate
analysis recognized Binet A vs B or C (P < .0001), CD38,
ZAP70, and CD49d expression (P = .002, P = .009, P =
.01, respectively), IGHV mutational status (P < .0001),
presence of del17p/P53 gene mutations (P = .0005), and
NOTCH1 gene mutations (P = .03), as significantly related
to TTFT. In terms of OS, all these variables maintained
prognostic significance in univariate analysis except for

ZAP70, CD49d and CD38 expression (the latter being
borderline, P = .06), NOTCH1 mutations (P = .14), and
Binet stage (P = .18).
Mutations of SF3B1, MYD88, and BIRC3 did not
reach statistical significance due to the low number of
mutated patients at CLL diagnosis in this prospective
cohort of patients (Table 1).

Validation set and cause of deaths
EBV DNA was detectable in 62 of 112 CLL
patients (55%), and was ≥ 2000 copies/µg DNA in 22%.
As reported in Table S1, similarly to the learning set,
EBV DNA load was significantly associated with CD38
expression.
The predictive value of EBV DNA load was
confirmed in the validation set, both in terms of OS and
TTFT (Figure S1).
We observed 30 deaths in the learning set, and 32
in the validation set. Causes of death were apparently
similarly distributed among patients with different EBV

DNA load at CLL diagnosis. Second cancer was the cause
of death in 5% and 12%, CLL progression in 42% and
41%, infection in 8% and 9%, age-related complications
in 13% and 14% of patients with low and high EBV DNA
load, respectively. None of the differences was statistically
significant.

In terms of OS, EBV DNA load resulted as the
strongest independent predictive factor (P = .0004),
together with IGHV mutational status (P = .02). Del17p/
P53 mutations were not significant in multivariate analysis
due to their rarity (only 2 patients with del17p/P53
mutation and high EBV DNA load, Table 1). The analysis
identified Binet stage C (P = .0001), unmutated IGHV (P =
.0005), and EBV DNA load as significant variables which
independently predicted a shorter TTFT. Details are listed
in Table 2.
In accordance with Cox’s model results, a high EBV
DNA load significantly predicted for poor OS and TTFT
in both IGHV mutated and unmutated patients (Figure 3).

EBV DNA load as continuous variable

DISCUSSION

As Cox model indicated that EBV DNA load was
predictive as continuous variable, and given that EBV
DNA load varied widely from patient to patient (range
0-36449), we analyzed the impact of increasing levels of
EBV DNA load on OS. When patients were divided in
three groups according to frequency distribution of EBV
DNA load (10th to 25th vs 25th to 90th vs >90th percentile), we
observed a progressive impairment of OS curves (Figure
4). Of note, patients with EBV DNA load ≥5000 copies/µg
DNA (21, 10%) had an extremely poor 5-years OS of 50%
± 12% vs 95% ± 3% for patients with EBV DNA load of 0
(P < .0001) vs 80% ± 5% for those with EBV DNA load of
1 to 4999. Again, as shown in Figure 4b-4c, results were

In this study, we present for the first time an analysis
on the clinical significance of EBV DNA load in patients
with CLL at disease presentation. We have shown that
EBV DNA load, tested in MNC, is detectable in more
than half of patients, and that high levels (≥ 2000 copies/
µg DNA) are found in one fifth of patients. We found
that EBV DNA load had a strong relationship with OS.
The predictive value of viral load was independent of
commonly recognized prognostic factors, and increasing
levels of EBV DNA load were directly associated to worse
outcome. Patients with EBV DNA ≥ 2000 copies/µg DNA
had a 5-years OS of 67% ± 8%, which resembled patients
with del17p/P53 gene mutation (5-years OS of 60% ±

unmutated IGHV were .001 and .04, respectively. All other differences were not statistically significant.

16%) or patients with unmutated IGHV (5-years OS 69%
± 6%). An independent retrospective series of patients
with longer follow-up corroborated our findings.
Our study has the merit of analysing a prospective
series (learning set), avoiding bias related to patients
selection. Despite the relatively short follow up for
this indolent disease (54 months), the discriminating
power of EBV DNA on OS appeared relevant. Since
EBV replication is known to be related to severe
immunosuppression, we hypothesized that the excess
of deaths in patients with high EBV DNA load was due
to infections or second tumors. However, deaths due to
infections were 9% and 8% in patients with high or low
EBV DNA load, respectively, while fatal second cancers
were observed in 12% of patients with high EBV DNA
and in 5% of patients with low EBV DNA load (P = .25).
The poor prognosis conferred by high EBV DNA load was
attributable, at least in part, to shorter TTFT (P = .0008),
reflecting a more pronounced tumor aggressiveness,
regardless of clinical stage at diagnosis (Binet A, B or
C). Moreover, no significant relationship between EBV
DNA load and age, or unmutated IGHV was observed.
These findings suggest that EBV may not be a mere
manifestation of the underlying immunosuppression
associated with CLL, although further studies are needed
to clarify this.
So far, molecular detection of EBV DNA in
circulating MNC or plasma of patients with CLL had not
been consistently reported in the literature. Hermouet et
al. [20] reported that 11 of 21 patients (52%) with CLL
had measurable EBV DNA load in peripheral blood
lymphocytes by a real-time PCR assay. More recently,
a study from Poland found detectable EBV-DNA load
in mononuclear cells of 54% patients with CLL [21].
Similarly to our findings, an association between higher
EBV load, CD38 expression and del11q, together with a
shorter treatment-free survival was reported.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We acknowledge that our observations cannot
define the biological role of EBV in CLL. Further
studies are needed, as it has been done in EBV-driven
lymphoproliferative disorders [3-5]. We observed that
EBV DNA was detectable in sorted CLL B-lymphocytes
in five patients at similar levels than in MNC, while it
was consistently undetectable in the plasma of 20 patients
with either high or low EBV DNA load. This indicates that
EBV may latently infect CLL B-cells, since the absence
of DNA in plasma samples argues against an active lytic
infection. At our cut-off value (2000 copies/µg DNA),
roughly one cell out of 100 is infected by the virus (1 µg
of DNA corresponds to approximately 100.000 infected
cells or 200.000 EBV DNA copies). However, since EBV
does not behave as a normal gene, and each cell could
contain more than one viral genome, 2000 copies/ug
DNA may correspond to less than one infected cell every
100. Therefore, we can speculate that a relatively small
number of CLL B-cells is infected by the virus at disease
presentation, and that this EBV-related sub-clone would
subsequently expand conditioning B-cells proliferation
and the microenvironment. When latently infecting
B lymphocytes EBV induces sustained telomerase
activity [22], which is known to confer to B-CLL cases
an aggressive clinical behaviour [23]. This link between
EBV and telomerase may represent an explanation to the
accelerated clinical course we have described in patients
with high EBV DNA load. Longitudinal monitoring of
EBV DNA load at different time points during CLL course
would be of key importance to verify this theory. On the
other hand, the presence of EBV DNA at higher levels in
some patients may merely represent a consequence of the
deeper immunosuppression, which is known to enhance
tumor aggressiveness. For this reason, an assessment of
T-lymphocyte and natural killer cell count, together with
immunoglobulines level is warranted in these patients.
The literature does not provide a consistent threshold

value corresponding to “high” EBV load, despite EBV is
routinely investigated using sensitive and quantitative
PCR methods, to relate virus loads to disease emergence
and progression in several hematological malignancies
including post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders
[24, 25]. We observed that 95% of our healthy subjects
had EBV DNA load < 2000 copies/µg DNA, and we
assumed this as a cut-off value to define high level.
Similarly, Stevens et al. [19] found that MNC samples of
healthy donors had EBV DNA load < 2000 copies/ml in
almost all cases. This is consistent with previous studies
that found EBV genome copy number in adults with latent
EBV infection [24]. The variations in EBV DNA detection
rates may be ascribed to the use of different assay systems,
and to the lack of an agreed calibrator, specimen type, or
unit adopted for reporting [25]. Obviating the need of a
specific cut-off, EBV DNA load as a continuous variable
was highly predictive in our series (Figure 4).
EBV has been well characterized in cases of
Richter’s transformation of CLL, particularly those
displaying abundant Reed – Sternberg type cells [26].
In some, but not all cases, the malignant transformation
occurs in cells originating from the CLL clone. In
other cases of patients heavily pre-treated with T cell
suppressants such as fludarabine, Richter’s has been
associated with the development of an unrelated EBVassociated B-cell clone showing that EBV or other viruses
could drive Richter’s transformation in some patients
with CLL in the presence of impaired EBV-specific
T-cell immunity [27, 14-16]. However, the precise role
of EBV infection in Richter’s transformation remains
to be determined. In our series we described 12 patients
developing Richter’s transformation during follow-up (8
in the learning set and 4 in the validation set). Four of
these had EBV DNA load ≥ 2000 copies/µg DNA (Table
1 and Table S1). Median EBV DNA load among patients
with Richter’s transformation was higher (1232 copies/
µg DNA) than in patients without transformation (185
copies/µg DNA), but this difference was not statistically
significant (P = .16). It is conceivable that sample
collection in our patients undergoing later transformation
was obtained too early, thus hampering a more precise
evaluation of EBV role in driving CLL transformation.
In summary, our analysis on prospective patients
with CLL indicates that EBV is present in peripheral MNC
in more than half of patients with newly diagnosed CLL.
High levels of EBV DNA are associated with an aggressive
clinical behavior and short survival. The independence of
EBV DNA load from most widely recognized biological
and clinical prognostic factors indicates that a quantitative
test for EBV DNA load could be integrated in the initial
evaluation of patients to better define their outcome.
Further studies are needed to clarify whether EBV has an
active role in enhancing CLL progression or is merely a
manifestation of the underlying immunosuppressed state
associated with the disease.

Patients
A total of 220 consecutive patients with newly
diagnosed CLL referred to two major Hematology
Divisions (San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, and University
Hospital, Verona), were enrolled between June 2007
and December 2013, and followed prospectively.
These patients constituted a learning set for prognostic
considerations. A subsequent cohort was used for
independent confirmation (validation set). In all patients
biological material was collected at diagnosis, before
receiving any cytotoxic treatment. All patients met the
CLL diagnostic criteria of National Cancer Institute
Working Group [18], and gave written informed consent to
donate their blood and to have their clinical data collected
into a dedicated database. Patients with monoclonal
B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) were excluded. The study
was approved by the ethic review board of San Bortolo
Hospital, as an ancillary study of the “CLL Veneto”
project, which was started in 2007 as a prospective clinical
and biological registry of incident patients diagnosed with
CLL.

Clinical characteristics and treatment
The median age of patients enrolled in the learning
set was 65 years (range 30-86 years), with a male/female
ratio of 1.97. Clinical and biological characteristics are
listed in Table 1. At the time of this analysis, median
follow-up from CLL diagnosis was 54 months (range
12-98). Overall, 81 patients (37%) received induction
chemo-immunotherapy consisting of rituximab,
fludarabine, cyclophosphamide in 36 (45%), rituximab
and chlorambucil in 20 (25%), chlorambucil alone in 12
(14%), and other immunochemotherapies in 13 (16%),
following the guidelines of the CLL Veneto protocol,
which were based on widely accepted guidelines in terms
of treatment and visits of follow-up [18].

Blood processing, DNA and RNA extraction
At CLL diagnosis, we collected 20 mL of whole
blood for each patient in EDTA-rinsed tubes. Plasma was
obtained by centrifugation of samples. Peripheral blood
MNC were isolated by Ficoll gradient, and were used for
DNA and RNA extraction using QIAGEN spin-column
kits and automatically extracted by QIAcube (Qiagen).
Extracted DNA and RNA were then quantified by using
the Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
Both plasma and nucleic acids were subsequently frozen
at -80°C.

DNA load.

patients with CLL (Table S1) [18].

Phenotypical, molecular, and genetic analysis
CD49d, ZAP-70 and CD38 expression were
assessed on peripheral blood samples by flow cytometry,
as previously described [28]. Extracted RNA was used
to assess immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region
(IGHV) mutational status, and stereotypes of the B-cell
receptor were determined by analyzing the complete
sequence of the heavy-chain complementary-determining
region 3 in 210 patients (137 from the learning set and 73
from the validation set), as previously reported [29].
Cytogenetic abnormalities were evaluated by
cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
according to the hierarchical risk model of FISH anomalies
[30]. The mutation hot spots of the TP53 (exons 4-9,
including splicing sites; RefSeq NM_000546.5), NOTCH1
(exon 34; including splicing sites; RefSeq NM_017617.2),
SF3B1 (exons 14, 15, 16, 18, including splice sites;
RefSeq NM_012433.2), MYD88 (exons 3, 5, including
splicing sites; RefSeq NM_002468.4), and BIRC3 (exons
6-9, including splicing sites; RefSeq NM_001165.4) genes
were analyzed on extracted DNA by PCR amplification
and DNA direct sequencing of high-molecular-weight
genomic DNA, as previously described [31].

Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
measuring EBV DNA
EBV DNA load was assessed by quantitative
PCR using DNA extracted from plasma or MNC, and
was expressed as number of DNA copies per µg of total
extracted DNA (copies/µg DNA). Analysis were made
by setting up real time PCR performed on Rotor-Gene Q
(Qiagen) using artus EBV QS-RGQ kit (Qiagen) following
the instructions provided by the company. The EBV RGQ
Master contains reagents and enzymes for the specific
amplification of a 97 bp region of the EBNA-1 gene.
An internal control and external positive controls were
included to monitor the efficiency of sample preparation
and downstream assay. Further details are available at
http://www.qiagen.com/resources.

Epstein-Barr virus serological pattern
The presence of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG)
and IgM antibodies against the viral capsid antigen
(VCA) was studied in 74 patients at CLL diagnosis using
chemiluminescence immunoassay. Sixty-eight patients
(92%) were IgG+/IgM, 4 (5%) were IgG+/IgM+, and 2
(3%) were IgG-/IgM-.

Statistical analysis
EBV DNA load ≥ 2000 copies/µg DNA,
corresponding to the 95th percentile of healthy subjects,
was defined as high value, in keeping with data of the
literature [19].
Overall survival (OS), defined as the time interval
between CLL diagnosis and last follow-up or death for
any cause, was considered the primary outcome of the
study. Time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) was defined as the
time interval between the date of presentation and date
of first CLL treatment. Patients who did not receive any
treatment during follow-up were censored at their last
follow-up date. Actuarial OS and TTFT were estimated
by the Kaplan-Meier method [32] and differences were
analyzed by the log rank test. Proportional Cox Hazard
Model was used for multivariate analysis [33].
The comparison of clinical and biological features
between patients with high vs low load was carried out
with the χ2 test or with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney
test, as appropriate. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (K–S
test) was used to define the distribution of the EBV DNA
load as continuous variable. All variables found to have
a P value less than or equal to .05 were considered to be
statistically significant. All statistical calculations were
performed using StatView (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley,
CA).

Healthy subjects
Forty-one healthy subjects without signs or
symptoms of recent or ongoing fever, no enlarged
lymphnodes or infectious episodes were recruited among
blood donors or volunteers, and their peripheral blood
MNC were isolated tested for EBV DNA load. Sixteen
were females and median age was 59 years old (range 3274). We included 20 subjects older than 60 to minimize
age-related bias in comparison to CLL patients.

Validation set
For validation, we used an independent series of
112 patients with CLL, diagnosed at San Bortolo Hospital
between January 2001 and May 2007. This set included
retrospective cases with available stored biological
material at CLL diagnosis and follow-up data. Median
follow-up from CLL diagnosis was 103 months (range
14-168). Their clinical presentation and survival appeared
representative to an unselected cohort of consecutive
