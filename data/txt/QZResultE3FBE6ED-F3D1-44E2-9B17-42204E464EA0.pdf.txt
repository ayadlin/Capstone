Abstract
Targeted therapies for cancer are inherently limited by the inevitable recurrence of resistant disease after
initial responses. To define early molecular changes within residual tumor cells that persist after treatment, we
analyzed drug-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma cell lines exposed to reversible or irreversible epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, alone or in combination with MET-kinase inhibitors, to characterize the
adaptive response that engenders drug resistance. Tumor cells displaying early resistance exhibited dependence
on MET-independent activation of BCL-2/BCL-XL survival signaling. Further, such cells displayed a quiescencelike state associated with greatly retarded cell proliferation and cytoskeletal functions that were readily reversed
after withdrawal of targeted inhibitors. Findings were validated in a xenograft model, showing BCL-2 induction
and p-STAT3[Y705] activation within the residual tumor cells surviving the initial antitumor response to
targeted therapies. Disrupting the mitochondrial BCL-2/BCL-XL antiapoptotic machinery in early survivor cells
using BCL-2 Homology Domain 3 (BH3) mimetic agents such as ABT-737, or by dual RNAi-mediated knockdown
of BCL-2/BCL-XL, was sufficient to eradicate the early-resistant lung-tumor-cells evading targeted inhibitors.
Similarly, in a xenograft model the preemptive cotreatment of lung tumor cells with an EGFR inhibitor and a
BH3 mimetic eradicated early TKI-resistant evaders and ultimately achieved a more durable response with
prolonged remission. Our findings prompt prospective clinical investigations using BH3-mimetics combined
with targeted receptor kinase inhibitors to optimize and improve clinical outcomes in lung-cancer treatment.

targets, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 1, 2),
MET (3, 4), which can be therapeutically inhibited in human
cancer therapy. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), gefitinib and erlotinib, are approved targeted agents against
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with enhanced efficacy
toward tumors that express somatic sensitizing kinase
domain mutations (e.g., L858R, exon 19 deletions; 5–7). One
of the most formidable challenges of targeted therapy is the
invariable tumor secondary resistance after initial response.
MET genomic amplification has been implicated in about 20%
of acquired EGFR TKI resistance (8, 9) whereas the EGFR
gatekeeper T790M kinase mutation (10–12) accounts for
approximately half of the resistant cases. Further targeting
strategies to overcome EGFR TKI resistance include the use of
irreversible TKIs (10, 13, 14), pan-EGFR/ERBB kinase inhibitors (15), and MET inhibitors (8, 16). The MET receptor has
been shown to be an important molecule in a variety of
malignancies (3, 17) and has recently been validated as an
attractive therapeutic target in cancer therapy, including lung
cancer (4, 18–23). Reversible small molecule inhibitors to
target against MET have been developed for novel anticancer
therapeutic intervention (20, 21, 24–26). Studies from our
group and others have recently showed the cross-talk signaling network between EGFR and MET, and also the role of MET

inhibition in combination with EGFR inhibitor in lung cancer
in overcoming MET amplified resistance (8) or T790M–EGFR
mediated resistance (16) to EGFR–TKI.
Further knowledge into additional mechanisms of tumorcell resistance to targeted inhibitors should prove to be of great
significance in the quest for novel effective treatment strategies
to impact the long-term prognosis of lung cancer. Majority of
the reported studies investigating mechanisms of tumor resistance centered on late time window after chronic exposure to
TKIs at escalating dosing concentrations when secondary
resistant clones ultimately arose and propagated from the
parental drug-sensitive cell populations. Nonetheless, a deep
understanding of the entire spectrum of tumor cells mechanistic strategies to escape or evade targeted therapeutics in
resistance, especially during the early inhibitory phase, remains
to be better defined at present (27, 28). Here, we investigated
the "early" molecular events in lung tumor cells under targeted
EGFR alone or combined with MET-kinase inhibitors treatment. Our results identified that a resurgence of prosurvivalantiapoptotic signaling was evident in the surviving tumor with
early evasion against the targeted kinase inhibitors, that
involved a TKI-induced dependence of activated STAT3, and
its transcriptional target BCL-2/BCL-XL, with therapeutic
translational values. Our results show that proapoptotic
BCL-2 Homology Domain 3 (BH3)-mimetic, such as ABT737, can be effective in eradicating these "early" TKI-resistant
lung tumor evader cells, thereby potentially enhancing the
long-term efficacy of targeted EGFR lung cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and immunoblotting
Lung cancer cell lines were obtained directly from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown under standard
cell culture conditions. Cell lines characterization and authentication were carried out by the ATCC Molecular Authentication
Center, using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) for interspecies identification and short tandem repeat (STR) anlaysis
(DNA fingerprinting) for intraspecies identification. Sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS—PAGE)
and Western blotting were carried out as previously described
(16, 29). The primary antibodies used are as follows: phosphoMET[Y1234/1235]: Cell Signaling Technology (CST), MET
(C-12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-EGFR[Y1068]; CST,
EGFR (Santa Cruz), phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr), phosphoAKT[S473], AKT, phospho-MAPK(ERK1/2)[T202/Y204]—
allfromCST,MAPK(ERK1/2): Biosource,phospho-STAT3[Y705];
CST, STAT3, BCL-2, BCL-XL (all from Zymed), cleaved-Caspase3[Asp175], cleaved-PARP[Asp214], phospho-STAT5[Y694]—all
from CST, survivin (Zymed) and actin (Santa Cruz).
Chemicals and inhibitors
EGFR inhibitor (reversible) erlotinib was prepared as previously described (29, 30). MET inhibitors SU11274,
PHA665752 and EGFR inhibitor (irreversible) CL-387,785 were
obtained from EMD–Calbiochem. BCL-2 family inhibitors
ABT-737, obatoclax mesylate (GX15–070), and HA14–1 were
obtained from Selleck.

Cellular cytotoxicity, viability, and survival assays
Cellular cytotoxicity and viability assays were carried out
using CellTiter 96 AQueous. One Solution Cell Proliferation
(MTS) assay (Promega), according to the manufacturer's
instruction at 72 hours after treatment with indicated inhibitors in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) media. For the studies
of cells under 9 days of pretreatment under targeted (EGFR/
MET) inhibitors, the indicated inhibitors in the culture media
were replenished at least every 2–3 days (which was verified to
be indistinguishable from daily TKI replacement) prior to cell
harvesting at the end of the inhibitory culture for subsequent
cellular assays.
For cell survival assay using crystal violet staining method,
H1975 cells or HCC827 cells were treated as described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods with indicated TKIs
for 6 days, followed by indicated BH3-mimetic inhibition with
or without concurrent TKI for 3 extra days.
Time-lapsed video microscopy: Image analysis of
cytoskeletal functions
HCC827 cells were plated on cell-culture dishes in a temperature-controlled chamber at 37 C in an atmosphere of 5%
CO2 for time-lapsed video microscopy (TLVM) analysis of
cytoskeletal functions and determination of cellular mitotic
activities as previously described (16) and also in Supplementary Materials.
In vivo xenograft model and bioluminescence imaging
of human lung cancer
Lung cancer xenograft. Firefly-luciferase(luc)-expressing
HCC827 and H1975 lung cancer cells, and their corresponding
murine xenograft models were established as previously
described (see also Supplementary Materials and Methods)
according to institution-approved protocols and guidelines
(16). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of the tumor xenograft was carried out in the Tissue Procurement and Histology
Core Facility, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, using antihuman BCL-2 (Abcam), antihuman p-STAT3[Y705] (rabbit
monoclonal antibody, D3A7, CST) primary antibodies. For
details see also Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Tumor microarray
Human lung cancer tumor microarray was purchased from
Zymed-Invitrogen (MaxArray Human Lung Cancer Tissue
Microarray Slides, Cat. No. 75–4083). IHC staining using
antihuman BCL-2 antibody was carried out as described
above, and graded using 4-tier scoring system (0, 1þ, 2þ,
and 3þ) by a dedicated thoracic pathologist (S. H.-K.). For the
lung cancer tumor microarray (TMA) analysis, the TMA
used in the analysis consisted of the followings: Squamous
Cell (n ¼ 25), Adenocarcinoma (n ¼ 21), Large Cell (n ¼ 3),
SCLC (n ¼ 5), Carcinoid (n ¼ 2), Mesothelioma (n ¼ 2).
BCL-2/BCL-XL DNA transfection and RNA interference
studies
Human BCL-2 plasmid vector was a generous gift from Dr.
Clark Distelhorst (Case Western Reserve University). Transfection of the BCL-2 expression vector into HCC827 cells was

carried out using Fugene 6 according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Roche). RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown
studies were conducted using the Thermo Scientific/Dharmacon RNAi Technologies, including siGENOME siRNA-NT (nontargeting; Cat.#D-001210–02), siRNAs against human BCL-2
(Cat.#L-003307–00), and BCL-XL (Cat.#L-003458–00). For
HCC827 cells (Fig. 6A–B), cells were plated at full confluence
on 48-well plates, then cultured for 9 days in serum-containing
media (a) without inhibitor, or with treatment of (b) Erlotinib
alone for 9 days, or (c–f) Erlotinib together with the followings
in combination: (c) ABT-737 (2 mmol/L) concurrently at Day 0,
(d) siRNA-nontargeting (siNT), (e) siRNA-BCL-2, and (f) dual
siRNA-BCL-2/BCL-XL RNAi knockdown. Cells were then fixed
in methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet as above at
the end of day 9 to visualize the early TKI-resistant tumor
survivor cells emerged under various conditions. Experiments
were carried out in triplicate.
Statistical analysis
In the BCL-2 transfection study and erlotinib cellular cytotoxicity assay in the HCC827 cells (Fig. 5D), the results under
each transfection condition were first summarized by the area
under the curve (AUC). The differences of AUC between
transfection conditions were then examined by Z-test. Statistical data analysis of the in vivo study using HCC827-luc
xenograft murine model (Fig. 6E) was carried out using the
mixed model to examine the difference of read-out
[bioluminescence imaging (BLI) region of interest (ROI)]
among the four study groups (I–IV), by the in vivo xenograft
growth rate–changing rate over time [i.e., the change of readout (BLI ROI) divided by time (day)]. To ensure the normality
assumption for the mixed model used is satisfied, the readouts were transformed by natural log function, i.e., loge(readout), prior to fitting the data using Mixed Model. Tumor
recurrence was defined as 20% increase of tumor BLI-flux
from the nadir and the difference of recurrence rates between
Group II (ABT-737 alone), Group III (Erlotinib alone), and
Group IV (ABT-737 plus Erlotinib) was examined by Fisher's
exact test. All tests were two-sided and P-values  0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Results
Tumor resistance emerged "early" from EGFRreversible-TKI-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma evading
erlotinib:MET-independent BCL-2/BCL-XL signaling
The lung adenocarcinoma cell lines HCC827 and PC-9 are
both highly sensitive to reversible-EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib/
gefitinib), owing to the oncogenic sensitizing EGFR exon 19
deletion (E746_A750 del). Here, we focused to study the "early"
molecular alterations in tumor cells under TKI treatment, in
an attempt to uncover potential therapeutic "Achilles’ heel"
for the tumor cells that may survive the TKI within the early
time-window.
We first adopted the HCC827 cell line in the in vitro "early"
TKI-resistance studies, with the cells cultured under ongoing
erlotinib (1 mmol/L) inhibitory treatment up to 9 days.
We chose the concentration of erlotinib to be used at

4496

approximately IC70–75 in the 72-hrs cell viability assay. By
day 9 of inhibition, there were cell subpopulations ("early"
survivors, HCC827_ERL-D9.R) that evaded and survived the
TKI treatment. These "early" survivor cells exhibited a dramatic shift of TKI-sensitivity phenotype toward higher
resistance (100-fold), compared with the TKI-naïve parental cells (Fig. 1A). After an initial inhibited state, there was
also reactivated BCL–2/BCL–XL, within the background of a
tyrosine-phosphoproteomic reactivated cellular state of a
unique profile different from the parental cells (Fig. 1B–C).
Importantly, the tumor cells that survived up to days 6–9 of
the EGFR–TKI treatment evidently signaled independently
of EGFR and MET (Fig. 1C). Following an initial inhibitory
period, we observed a rather early p-STAT3[Y705] reactivation despite ongoing erlotinib treatment. These restored
prosurvival-antiapoptotic markers correlated well with
time-dependent downregulated cleaved-caspase 3 and
cleaved-PARP, indicative of a suppressed caspase-dependent
intrinsic apoptosis mechanism among these TKI-evader
cells. These results were further verified in PC-9 cell line,
with the erlotinib-surviving PC-9 cells (PC-9_ERL-D9.R) at
Day-9 inhibition exhibiting MET-independent upregulated
p-STAT3[Y705]/BCL-2/BCL-XL signaling, and "early" TKIresistance (Supplementary Fig. S1).
EGFR-irreversible-TKI-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma
H1975 cells also showed "early" tumor resistant evasion
from CL-387,785
We also tested the H1975 cell line against the irreversibleEGFR-TKI CL-387,785 as an alternate model. Similarly, the
"early" TKI-surviving H1975 cells (H1975_CL-D9.R) that were
harvested after 9 days of CL-387,785 (1mmol/L) exposure were
found remarkably more resistant (Fig. 2A), accompanied with
a prosurvival-antiapoptotic signaling upregulation as early as
beyond day 3 of inhibition (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the
findings in both HCC827 and PC-9 cells, the H1975_CL-D9.
R cells also signaled independent of MET. Intriguingly, the
H1975_CL-D9.R cells were found to exhibit reactivated pEGFR[Y1068] beyond day 3 and onward despite ongoing
CL-387,785, in the presence of complete p-MET inhibition.
Thus, the downstream prosurvival-antiapoptotic signaling in
the survivor cells may still be at least partially driven by EGFR
signaling. We verified that the reactivated EGFR phosphorylation, and its downstream signals emerged in the H1975_CLD9.R cells, could be inhibited by a higher concentration (5
mmol/L) of the same inhibitor (Fig. 2C). Nonetheless, p-STAT3
and BCL-2 were not effectively inhibited by the retreatment,
highlighting their potential importance in promoting the
cellular resistant survival, independent of both EGFR and
MET signaling.
Early EGFR–TKI resistance exhibited "adaptive"
phenotypes that were highly "reversible"
Using TLVM analysis, we found that the HCC827_ERL-D9.
R exhibited a cellular "quiescence-like" state, with dramatically inhibited proliferative and cytoskeletal functions while
in evasion against erlotinib. Promptly after erlotinib-withdrawal, we found that the early resistant cells could readily

(Fig. 3A) and mitotic proliferation (Fig. 3B; see also Supplementary Movies). We further tested to see if the Day-9 "early"
resistant cells could maintain their resistant phenotype after
a brief period of TKI withdrawal. Interestingly, after only
7 days of withdrawal of the corresponding TKIs, both
HCC827_ERL-D9.R and H1975_CL-D9.R cells quickly
reverted back to a highly TKI-sensitive phenotype, indistinguishable from parental-cell populations, respectively
(Fig. 3C and E). Importantly, upon a washout period of
TKI-withdrawal, these early resistant escape survivor tumor
cells reexhibited TKI-induced p-EGFR inhibition as in the
TKI-naïve parental cells (Fig. 3D).

targeted RTK-inhibitors. HCC827 xenograft was inhibited with
erlotinib for 3 days, during which remarkable tumor response

STAT3 downstream transcriptional target BCL-2 expression
was found induced in the TKI-evading survivor cells (Fig. 4A).

so cytoplasmic in the untreated HCC827 cells. Conversely, the
activated p-STAT3 signal was predominantly nuclear in the
residual HCC827 tumor early survivor cells circumscribing
along the xenograft periphery (Fig. 4B).
Past studies suggested that non-T790M-EGFR mediated
acquired gefitinib/erlotinib resistance in sensitive-lung cancer cells may include genomic MET amplification (8, 9) or
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) overexpression (31). Currently, there are various clinical trials investigating the
strategy of combining EGFR- and MET-inhibitors to enhance
therapeutic efficacy and overcome acquired EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC. We have previously characterized the MET
inhibitors SU11274 (20) and PHA665752 (21) in lung cancer
novel therapy, which were utilized in the present study.
Similar to the EGFR-TKI monotherapy model above, there
was an upregulated BCL-2/BCL-XL prosurvival-antiapoptotic signaling in H1975 TKI-evader cells after 9 days of
dual CL-387,785/PHA665752 inhibition, alongwith restored
p-STAT3 activation (Fig. 4C), and associating with a more
TKI-resistant phenotype in the evader cells (P ¼ 0.0118;

Figure 2. Targeted inhibition of irreversible EGFR-TKI-sensitive H1975

BCL-2.

We recently reported the efficacy of combined SU11274erlotinib (MET-EGFR/ERBB TKI) in vivo H1975 xenograft
model in overcoming T790M-EGFR drug-resistance, with
resultant near-complete BLI-radiographic complete response
(16). Here, we further evaluated the microscopic residual
TKI-evading H1975-luc tumor cells and found they resided
primarily along the tumor periphery juxtaposing the murine
host-microenvironment. These TKI-evading survivor tumor
cells also exhibited upregulated BCL-2 expression (Fig. 4D).

BCL-2 signal pathway expression and its potential
therapeutic utility in NSCLC inhibition by BH3-mimetic
BCL-2 was found to be expressed at varying levels in NSCLC
cell lines and lung tumor tissues, albeit at a significantly
lower level range than in SCLC (Fig. 5A–B). Interestingly,
unlike BCL-2, the expression levels of BCL-XL appeared to
be more comparable among NSCLC and SCLC cell lines
(Fig. 5A). TMA analysis showed that BCL-2 expression in
NSCLC was primarily nuclear, whereas that in SCLC was
strongly positive both nuclear and cytoplasmic. Stronger

Figure 3. "Adaptive" emergence of "early" TKI-resistant tumor survivor cells in HCC827 under erlotinib, and H1975 under CL-387,785 inhibitory
pressure. HCC827 cells (A–C): A, TLVM: HCC827_ERL-D9.R cells exhibited a "quiescence-like" state with highly inhibited cell proliferation as well
as cellular cytoskeletal functions that were both readily reversible upon TKI-washout for 11 days. B, cell mitotic index (M.I.) of HCC827 cells under various

inhibition after 7 days of TKI-washout culture conditions, indistinguishable from the parental HCC827 cells sensitivity (P > 0.05, N.S.). H1975 cells (D–E):
D, H1975_CL-D9.R cells were resensitized to TKI in cellular signaling inhibition promptly upon withdrawal of CL-387,785. E, H1975_CL-D9.R cells were
resensitized to CL-387,785 inhibition upon 7 days of TKI-washout, indistinguishable from the parental H1975 cells sensitivity (P > 0.05, N.S.).

BCL-2 nuclear expression was observed in squamous cell
comparing with adenocarcinoma subtype. Our results above
provide a rationale to target BCL-2 family signaling through
proapoptotic BH3-mimetic, such as ABT-737 (32–34), in order
to optimize targeted therapies. ABT-737 has been well-characterized recently and shown to antagonize BCL-2/BCL-XL,
thereby inducing a proapoptotic effect through the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptosis pathway. NSCLC cell lines were
relatively insensitive to ABT-737 (IC50 > 5 mmol/L), whereas
the SCLC H345 cell line tested was as expected highly sensitive
(IC50 < 0.2 mmol/L; Fig. 5C). HCC827 cells with forced overexpression of transfected BCL-2 was sufficient to induce a

significantly higher erlotinib-resistance, with 100-fold
increase in IC50 (Fig. 5D).
ABT-737 inhibition in concert with targeted kinase
inhibitors, both in vitro and in vivo, eradicated "early"
TKI-resistant tumor evaders and further inhibited
subsequent tumor recurrence
We hypothesized that preemptive inhibition and eradication of "early" resistant tumor cells in RTK targeted therapy
may impact on the long-term outcome of targeted therapy. We
adopted RNAi knockdown of BCL-2/BCL-XL using siRNA
methods here to test in parallel with ABT-737 (Fig. 6A–B).

Figure 4. In vivo xenograft lung tumor survivor cells evading against targeted inhibitors, with activated p-STAT3/BCL-2 antiapoptotic signaling. In vivo
HCC827 xenograft model treated with erlotinib (n ¼ 6) revealed "early" TKI-resistant tumor survivor cells (A) with induced BCL-2 expression especially
in the nuclear subcellular localization (red arrows), and (B) with nuclear translocation (red arrows) of p-STAT3[Y705] from the untreated cytoplasmic localization
(yellow arrows). C, combined MET–EGFR TKIs treatment of H1975 cells in vitro also led to an induction of MET-independent activated p-STAT3[Y705],
and BCL-2/BCL-XL signaling in TKI-evading survivor cells against 9 days of combined-TKIs (PHA665752 [1 mmol/L] and CL-387,785 [1 mmol/L]). D, induced
BCL-2 expression in H1975-xenograft residual dual SU11274/erlotinib-TKI-evader survivor cells.

Dramatic reduction in the early TKI-resistant tumor survivor
cells was achievable by dual BCL-2/BCL-XL RNAi knockdown
in conjunction with erlotinib, but not by mere knockdown of
BCL-2 alone. ABT-737, when used concurrently with erlotinib
to inhibit HCC827 cells, also dramatically reduced emergence
of early TKI-resistant tumor survivor cells against erlotinib
(Fig. 6B).
We further carried out in vitro ABT-737 inhibition studies
on the NSCLC H1975 TKI-evading tumor cells that were
primed to upregulate BCL-2/BCL-XL prosurvival signaling
by (i) EGFR/ERBB inhibitor (CL-387,785; Fig. 6C), and (ii) dual
EGFR–MET inhibitors (erlotinib plus SU11274; Fig. 6D). ABT737, at a concentration relatively insensitive against H1975
parental cells, completely eradicated the early CL-387,785resistant H1975 evader cells (Fig. 6C, top), either alone or in
combination with CL-387,785. Importantly, we showed that
the "early" TKI-resistant tumor cells were primed to be more
susceptible to ABT-737 inhibition, exhibiting a much
enhanced proapoptotic marker cleaved-PARP induction by
the BH3-mimetic (Fig. 6C, bottom). Moreover, the dual-TKIresistant H1975_ERL/SU-D9.R tumor cells could also be tar-

geted by ABT-737 to further induce apoptosis (Fig. 6D). Other
BH3-mimetic BCL-2 family inhibitors tested in our study,
obatoclax (35) and HA14–1 (36), also showed efficacy
(Fig. 6D). Similar to H1975 cells, early TKI-evading resistant
HCC827 cells also displayed therapeutic susceptibility to BH3mimetic in vitro (Fig. 6E).
Finally, we tested if the addition of the BH3-mimetic ABT737 in vivo would prolong the duration of response in
erlotinib-treated drug-sensitive HCC827-luc xenograft
(Fig. 6E). The in vivo ABT-737 treatment dosage in our study
was chosen based on reported literature on the therapeutic
range in the tested sensitive cancer models (37). The tumor
growth rate in recurrence of the ABT-737þErlotinib-treated
group (IV) was significantly lower than that of the Erlotinibalone group–III [P ¼ 0.0009; Fig. 6E, Table 1; also Supplementary Fig. S3]. ABT-737-alone (Group II) did not account
for the tumor regression and abrogation of tumor recurrence
as seen in the ABT-737þErlotinib group (Group IV; P ¼
0.0004). Finally, the HCC827 tumor recurrence rates at
day 18 and day 32 for Group III (Erlotinib-alone) animals
were 50% (P ¼ 0.014) and 62.5% (P ¼ 0.004), respectively,

Discussion
In recent years, molecularly-targeted cancer therapy has
renewed our hope for cancer cure. Nonetheless, the challenges
of clinical tumor resistance, both intrinsic and acquired,
remain formidable and substantially limit long-term efficacy.
Classic secondary mutational resistance [e.g., T790M-EGFR
against gefitinib/erlotinib in lung cancer (11)], and receptor
kinase class-switching [e.g., from EGFR-addiction to MET/
HGF (8, 9, 16), IGF1-R (27, 38), or AXL (39) signaling] have been
identified in earlier studies that emphasized on "acquired"
drug-resistance at "late-stages" of chronic drug treatment. Our
study here focuses on the molecular changes of drug-sensitive
tumor cell population within the "early" time-window of
targeted TKI treatment. We identified and further characterized the "early" adaptive functional TKI-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells that survived and evaded EGFR/MET-TKI,
as early as within 9 days of therapy. During our manuscript preparation, Settleman and colleagues reported the
identification of "drug-tolerant state" in cancer cell subpopulations that was maintained through engagement of IGF-1R
signaling and an epigenetic alteration of chromatin state that

www.aacrjournals.org

requires the histone demethylase RBP2/KDM5A/Jarid1A (27).
Our report here lends further support to the emerging evidence of the existence of tumor cell subpopulations with
adaptive resistant-escape under therapeutic inhibitory stress.
These early adaptive resistant survivors likely serve as the
founder population as minimal residual disease in solid
cancers under therapeutic pressure, which ultimately leads
to frankly recurrent resistant disease on therapy in the future.
Despite the new insights into nonmutational early resistance (28), detailed underlying regulatory mechanism(s) that
directly mediate the emergence of such early resurgent resistant cells against the inhibitors remain to be fully defined. Our
study here provided the first evidence that the "early" emergence of resistant tumor survivors evading EGFR/ERBB-MET
TKIs is independent of MET receptor signaling activation,
contrasting previous reports of MET genomic amplification as
acquired resistance mechanism in HCC827 cells that escape
"chronic" dose-escalating gefitinib inhibition at "late stages"
after many months of treatment (8, 9). We present findings
here that the BCL-2-family signaling in the mitochondrial
(intrinsic) programmed-cell death pathway may indeed represent the central mechanism as tumor cells’ newly-dependent
addiction, in promoting "early tumor evasion" to survive
targeted therapeutics. Here, we also provide additional in vivo
therapeutic study evidence to validate the efficacy of targeting

prosurvival resistance against dual-TKIs inhibition by erlotinib/SU11274 (ERL/SU). The experiment was carried out with H1975 cells similar to (C)
above, except that cells were pretreated with dual EGFR–MET inhibitors here, i.e., erlotinib (1 mmol/L)/SU11274 (1 mmol/L). BH3-mimetic used in treatment

the BCL-2 family antiapoptotic machinery in the residual
tumor survivors under TKI(s) therapeutic inhibition
(Fig. 6E). Collectively, our results further raise the promise
of the feasibility in "drugging" the drug-resistant residual
tumor cells (40), particularly within an early therapeutic
window-of-opportunity. Hence, targeting the mitochondrial
antiapoptotic machinery as the secondary "Achilles’ heel"
newly-emerged in the early-resistant tumor cells appears to
be an attractive therapeutic strategy. On the other hand,
concurrent EGFR-TKI and ABT-737 treatment also significantly suppressed the emergence of early TKI-resistant
HCC827 cells, evident as early as within 6 to 9 days (Fig. 6)
with the efficacy lasting up to 4 to 6 weeks (data not shown).
We believe that the novel therapeutic strategy in targeting the
adaptive drug-evader tumor survivor cells emergent within
the "early treatment time-window" is attractive, as these
evader cells are most likely more "homogeneous" molecularly
than those found eventually as overtly resistant disease after
"chronic" TKI inhibition for months. "Late" TKI-resistant
tumor cells likely already had undergone divergent resistant
molecular evolution in progression, hence more heterogeneous, during the long time lapsed under chronic TKI stress.
Our data suggest that the early tumor survival against TKI is
an "adaptive" mechanism, rather than a selection of preexisting
resistant cell clones. It remains unclear at present as to what
definitively regulates and determines the cell fates early under
targeted inhibition, and which cells among the parental drugsensitive cell population would emerge as resistant survivors in
the beginning of the tumor evolution under therapeutic stressors. Nonetheless, the contribution of intrinsic molecular
heterogeneity and nongenetic variation within individual cells
among the parental cell population may still play at least a
partial role in the ultimate cell-fate determination. Interestingly, BCL-2 has recently been implicated as inhibitor of DNA
repair mechanism (41–44), which may potentially enhance and
facilitate the molecular evolution of tumor progression beyond
the "early" nonmutational resistance.
Persistent STAT3 activation has been detected in a variety
of hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors (45–47). We
observed phosphorylated-STAT3(p-STAT3) in the residual
tumor survivor cells both in vitro and in vivo under targeted
kinase inhibitors. Our results suggest that "early" reactivation
of STAT3 at tyrosine-705 (important in STAT3 dimerization
and subsequent nuclear translocation) may be an important

www.aacrjournals.org

central transcriptional programming event prior to the ultimate resurgence of resistant tumor survivors. Recent attempts
to develop therapeutic inhibitors to target STAT3 have proven
to be rather difficult. Nonetheless, a number of BH3-mimetic
that target the key STAT3 downstream transcriptional targets,
such as BCL-2/BCL-XL, have shown promise in preclinical and
clinical studies, including ABT-737, and the newer pan-BCL-2
family inhibitors ABT-263, and obatoclax (37, 48, 49). The
latter pan-BCL-2 family inhibitors may potentially be more
advantageous over ABT-737 in their effective inhibition of
MCL-1, shown to induce ABT-737 resistance (50).
To our knowledge, our study represents the first in vivo
evidence that therapeutic targeting early resurgent resistant
tumor survivor cells evading cancer targeted inhibitors is
feasible through inhibiting the mitochondrial antiapoptotic
BCL-2/BCL-XL signaling in NSCLC, impacting on the therapeutic outcome. Our results here provide support to further
develop BH3-mimetic beyond basally BCL-2 overexpressing
tumors such as SCLC and lymphomas, and extend to NSCLC
as a therapeutic strategy to unleash the full potential and to
optimize long-term clinical outcome of oncogenic kinase
inhibitors. We propose that the combinational approach using
BH3-mimetic and RTK inhibitors should be investigated
further in the context of NSCLC human clinical trial studies.
