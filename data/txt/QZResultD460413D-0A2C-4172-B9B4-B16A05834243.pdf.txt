BACKGROUND: Activating, nonamplification ERBB2 mutations (ERBB2mut) are not detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), but are detected by DNA sequencing and may predict clinical responses to human epidermal
growth factor receptor (HER2)-targeted therapy. The authors queried 5605 advanced/metastatic breast cancers (mBC) to uncover
the frequency of ERBB2mut genomic alterations. Clinical responses to anti-HER2 therapeutics were identified. METHODS: DNA was
extracted from 40 mm of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was used to
evaluate up to 315 genes (5923 mean coverage depth). Results were analyzed for base substitutions, short indels, copy number
changes, and selected rearrangements. RESULTS: Of 5605 cases, 698 (12.5%) featured ERBB2 alterations, including 596 (10.6%)
ERBB2 amplifications (ERBB2amp) and 138 (2.4%) ERBB2mut; 38 cases (0.7%) had co-occurring ERBB2amp and ERBB2mut.
ERBB2mut predominantly affected the kinase (124 cases; 90%) or extracellular (15 cases; 11%) domains. Both primary BC (52 cases;
38%) and metastatic site biopsies (86 cases; 62%) were found to harbor ERBB2mut, which were distributed across carcinoma not
otherwise specified (NOS) (69 cases; 50%), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (40 cases; 29%), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) (27
cases; 20%), and mucinous mBC (2 cases; 1%). Genes commonly coaltered with ERBB2 were tumor protein 53 (TP53) (49%); phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) (42%); cadherin 1, type 1 (CDH1) (37%); MYC (17%); and cyclin D1 protein
(CCND1) (16%). CDH1 mutations were enriched in ERBB2mut mBC (P<0.0006) and associated with recurrent mBC. Selected patients
with ERBB2mut, without ERBB2amp, who responded to anti-HER2 targeted therapies are presented herein. CONCLUSIONS: Within
this large series, 1.8% of cases harbored ERBB2mut, which are undetectable by standard-of-care IHC or FISH tests. Metastatic BC
driven by ERBB2mut respond to anti-HER2 targeted therapies, and expanding clinical trials designed to detect ERBB2mut by CGP

INTRODUCTION
The ERBB2 gene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor/
human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of proteins.1 ERBB2 gene amplification has been identified in 10% to
34% of invasive breast cancers, is associated with HER2 (p185 neu) protein overexpression, and has been associated with
increased cell proliferation, cell motility, tumor invasiveness, progressive regional and distant metastases, accelerated angiogenesis, and reduced apoptosis.2-4 ERBB2-driven breast cancer is more frequently associated with higher histologic grade, is more
often negative for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and often presents with positive lymph node metastases.2 Positive HER2 status has been identified in all 4 subtypes of breast cancer: basal-like, luminal A, luminal B, and HER2enriched.5 ERBB2 amplification with corresponding HER2 protein overexpression is associated with sensitivity to therapies

targeting HER2, including antibodies, reversible and irreversible kinase inhibitors, and dual epidermal growth factor
receptor/HER2 kinase inhibitors. These targeted therapies
include the US Food and Drug Administration-approved
drugs lapatinib, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and adotrastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1).6-9
Nonamplification ERBB2 alterations (ERBB2mut)
have been identified in a wide variety of solid tumors,
including advanced/metastatic breast cancer (mBC).10,11
ERBB2mut are not detected by routine clinical immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), but are detected by DNA sequencing
assays.10 Recent evidence had demonstrated that the presence of ERBB2mut can predict clinical responses to antiHER2 targeted therapies.12-16 We examined a database of
5605 clinical cases of recurrent mBC to determine the
prevalence of ERBB2mut as a therapy target and to identify associated genomic alterations (GAs) in cases of clinically advanced mBC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A series of 5605 clinically advanced mBC cases were analyzed by DNA sequencing to identify somatic GAs. Local
site permissions to use clinical samples were obtained for
the current study. On routine microscopic examination, all
samples had a minimum 20% tumor nuclear area compared with benign nuclear area. Comprehensive genomic
profiling (CGP) was performed in a Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified, College of
American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, Mass). In brief,  50 ng of
DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of tumor samples. Hybridization capture
of 3320 exons from up to 315 cancer-related genes and
select introns of 28 genes commonly rearranged in cancer
were applied to the extracted DNA. The samples were
sequenced to high, uniform coverage, with a mean sequencing depth of 5643, as previously described.17 GAs, including base substitutions, small insertions or deletions (indels),
rearrangements, and copy number alterations, were determined and reported for these samples.
RESULTS
From a series of 5605 consecutive clinical cases of mBC
CGP, 697 cases (12.5%) featured ERBB2 alterations.
ERBB2 amplifications (ERBB2amp) were identified in
596 of the mBC cases (10.6%), and 138 cases (2.4%) had
an ERBB2 activating mutation (ERBB2mut) (a base
substitution or indels). Thirty-eight mBC cases (0.7%)
had both ERBB2amp and ERBB2mut, which accounted

Figure 1. Distribution of ERBB2 alterations in 5605 cases of
recurrent metastatic breast cancer. Copy number gains
(amplifications [Amp]) only were observed in 10% of samples, ERBB2 mutations (Mut) alone were observed in 1.8% of
samples, and both Amp and Mut were found in 0.7% of cases.
The remaining 87.5% of breast carcinoma samples did not
harbor alterations in ERBB2.

for 5.5% of all ERBB2-altered mBC cases and 27.5% of
all mBC cases with ERBB2mut (Fig. 1).
As seen in Table 1, the 138 female patients whose
clinically advanced breast cancers featured ERBB2mut
had a mean age of 59.6 years (range, 29-93 years). Samples analyzed by CGP included 52 primary BC tumors
(38%) and 86 tumors from metastatic sites (62%), including the liver (20%), lymph nodes (14%), bone/soft tissue/
skin (12%), serous cavities (6%), lung (4%), and miscellaneous sites (6%) (Tables 2 and 3). Of these tumors, 69
mBC cases (50%) were submitted as carcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS), 40 (29%) as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 27 (20%) as invasive lobular carcinoma
(ILC), and 2 (1%) as mucinous mBC.
Of the 138 ERBB2mut cases, 5 (3.6%) had > 1
ERBB2mut (4 tumors with 2 ERBB2mut and 1 tumor with
3 ERBB2mut). There were 124 ERBB2mut (90%) affecting
the kinase domain and 15 (11%) affecting the extracellular
domain (ECD) (Table 1) (Fig. 2). The majority of ERBB2mut led to base substitutions within the kinase domain,
including 34 L755S, 33 V777L, 16 D769H or Y, and
6 G776V substitutions. There were 22 insertion ERBB2mut, including 12 at residue P780, 7 at G776, and 3 at
V777. There was 1 activating splice site mutation, the
c.1899-1G>C mutation identified in case 105.18,19 Of
the ECD ERBB2mut, 7 were S310F and 4 were S310Y.
The mutations in ERBB2 described above are known activating mutations.

Bold values indicate a statistically significant difference in specimen site distribution between tumors harboring only amplifications and those without any
alterations in ERBB2 (wild-type) (P < 0.005). All other values did not reach statistical significance.

The most common genes found to be coaltered in
ERBB2mut mBC were tumor protein 53 (TP53) (49%);
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha
(PIK3CA) (42%); cadherin 1, type 1 (CDH1) (37%);
MYC (17%); and cyclin D1 protein (CCND1) (16%)
(Fig. 2, Table 4). The enrichment of CDH1 mutations in
ERBB2mut mBR was significant (P < 0.0006) and associated with recurrent lobular mBC (Table 1) (see Supporting Information Table 1), in agreement with previous
studies.11,20 PIK3CA also was found to be mutated significantly more often in ERBB2mut tumors (42%) compared
with tumors without any ERBB2 alterations (32%), either
mutation or amplification (P < 0.01) (Table 4). The
remaining genes appeared to be mutated at similar levels
in ERBB2mut and ERBB2 wild-type tumors.
Several individuals included in the current
study cohort have been reported to have responded to
anti-HER2 targeted therapy.12,21,22 The first was a 43year-old woman with a 10-year history of ER-positive,
PR-negative, and HER2-negative breast carcinoma who
presented in October 2012 with peritoneal and omental
metastases, a left adrenal mass, and enlargement of liver
metastases; the sample was found to have an ERBB2

ERBB2 S310F mutation and positive HERmark assay
(Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, Calif), the
patient experienced clinical benefit after treatment with
trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and fulvestrant.22 Finally, a
58-year-old patient with metastatic triple-negative inflammatory breast cancer that was found to be HER2 negative
by both FISH and IHC and who was previously treated
with multiple courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy underwent CGP that revealed 2 distinct ERBB2mut, 1 each in
the kinase domain (V777L) and the ECD (S310F). The
patient received multiple anti-HER2 targeted therapies
combined with chemotherapy and demonstrated substantial clinical response.12
DISCUSSION
The era of targeting HER2 for the treatment of breast cancer began in 1998 within the context of metastatic disease
and extended to the adjuvant setting in 2005.6,8,23,24 The

clinical criteria for using anti-HER2 targeted therapies are
HER2 overexpression detected by IHC, FISH, or chromogenic in situ hybridization.2 In 2004, nonamplification
alterations in the ERBB2 sequence were reported in patients
with lung adenocarcinoma and shown to be associated with
activation of HER2 signaling.25 Mutations affecting the kinase domain of HER2 can drive downstream nuclear processes impacting proliferation, invasiveness, and resistance
to apoptosis, and have emerged as potential therapy targets.15,25-28 In addition, sequence alterations within the
ECD of HER2 have been linked to increased dimerization
of the HER2 and HER3 proteins, a phenomenon associated with increased signaling in the absence of overexpression of either receptor or ligand.29 The distribution of
kinase versus ECD mutations appears to vary according to
tumor type. For breast cancer, base substitution kinase do2660

main mutations are more common. However, in other tumor types, such as urinary bladder cancer or non-small cell
lung cancer, base substitution ECD mutations10,30,31 or kinase domain insertion mutations10,25,32,33 are predominant. In the current study of recurrent and metastatic breast
cancer, kinase domain mutations accounted for 85% of the
ERBB2 mutations identified.
The publically available cBioPortal (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) databases, which include both primary
tumors that did not ultimately progress and metastatic
disease samples, list the ERBB2 mutation frequency in
breast cancer at between 1.7% and 2.0%.34,35 The slightly
higher frequency of 2.4% for ERBB2mut identified in the
current study of 5605 clinically advanced breast cancers
may reflect a lower frequency of ERBB2mut in breast cancers that are destined to be cured by primary therapies and
that are included in the COSMIC and cBioPortal databases. ERBB2mut appear to occur mostly, but not exclusively, in the absence of ERBB2amp. In the current study,
nearly 75% of breast cancers with ERBB2mut did not
have an ERBB2amp, such that, in 5605 cases of clinically
advanced breast cancer, 98 patients would have had a
negative slide-based HER2 IHC or FISH test, yet nonetheless still had an ERBB2-driven tumor that was potentially targetable with anti-HER2 therapies. ERBB2
nonamplification mutations thus define a substantial subset of breast carcinomas currently undetected by the
standard clinical criteria of overexpression determined by
IHC, FISH, or chromogenic in situ hybridization.

ERBB2 Short Variants in Breast Cancer/Ross et al

To the best of our knowledge, published clinical outcome reports describing the therapeutic targeting of
ERBB2mut in breast cancer have until recently been limited primarily to case reports.12,21,22 Both approved antibody therapeutics (trastuzumab) and kinase inhibitors
(lapatinib and afatinib) have been used to treat ERBB2mut
cancers of the breast and other organs. Non-small cell lung
cancer harboring ERBB2mut has been successfully controlled with afatinib,36 and major responses have been
observed in patients with rare ERBB2mut tumor types
treated with the combination of capecitabine and lapatinib.37 It has been theorized that anti-HER2 antibody therapeutics such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab may be
useful in the treatment of ERBB2mut tumors, especially
when the mutation is within the ECD and causing
enhanced dimerization of the HER2 and HER3 proteins.22
It is interesting to note that ERBB2mut when accompanying ERBB2amp has been cited as a potential acquired resistance mechanism for patients with HER2-positive disease
originally detected by IHC and/or FISH and currently progressing on standard anti-HER2 targeted therapies.38
The most frequently altered genes in this series of
ERBB2mut breast cancers included TP53 (49%) and
PIK3CA (42%). This TP53 mutation frequency is higher
than that published for primary breast cancer and the
enrichment may reflect the fact that all the patients had
stage IV disease at the time of sequencing34 and that TP53
missense mutation is a negative prognostic factor for breast
cancer.39,40 The association between PIK3CA mutations in
ERBB2amp breast cancer and the development of resistance to anti-HER2 targeted therapy is well documented.41
However, to the best of our knowledge, the association
between PIK3CA mutations and ERBB2mut in breast cancer is not well known and the potential impact of PIK3CA
mutations on the treatment of patients with ERBB2mut
breast cancer is currently not known. In addition, the
comutation frequency of 37% observed further validates an
association between ERBB2mut and clinically recurrent
CDH1 (E-cadherin)-mutated (CDH1mut) lobular breast
cancer, as previously described.11
The recent presentation of the results of a small clinical trial in which patients with ERBB2mut breast cancers
were treated with single-agent neratinib has significantly
increased interest in the treatment of nonamplification
ERBB2 alterations in patients with recurrent and
metastatic disease.16 Neratinib is a pan-ERBB2
irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor well known to inhibit
ERBB2mut breast cancer cell lines.15 In a study presented
at the 2015 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium of 13
evaluable patients, all with ERBB2 kinase domain mutaCancer

tions not accompanied by ERBB2 amplification, 5
patients (39%) achieved an objective response at 8 weeks
(95% confidence interval, 14%-68%). For the ERBB2mut-positive patients who responded to neratinib, there
was 1 complete response (ERBB2 L755S) and 4 partial
responses (ERBB2 L755S, V777L, V777L, and L869R)
reported.16 In this study, the significant association of
CDH1 mutations in ERBB2mut lobular breast cancers
was again observed.16 Other irreversible kinase inhibitors
currently are under development for the treatment of
patients with ERBB2mut breast cancer.42 The results of
this and other studies20 indicate that nearly 2% of patients
with late-stage breast cancer who would be HER2 negative by IHC may harbor targetable ERBB2 alterations not
commonly detected by other methods, a substantial population that could benefit from anti-HER2 targeted therapies. Given the preliminary results of these clinical studies
and the prevalence of ERBB2mut in patients with clinically advanced breast cancer, targeting nonamplification
ERBB2 genomic alterations in this disease demonstrates
significant promise and the continued evaluation of novel
treatment strategies appears warranted.
