Modulation of the ATPase and Transport Activities of BroadActing Multidrug Resistance Factor ABCC10 (MRP7)
Ekaterina V. Malofeeva, Natalya Domanitskaya, Mariya Gudima, and Elizabeth A. Hopper-Borge

Abstract
The cell surface molecule ABCC10 is a broad-acting transporter of xenobiotics, including cancer drugs,
such as taxanes, epothilone B, and modulators of the estrogen pathway. Abcc10/ mice exhibit increased
tissue sensitivity and lethality resulting from paclitaxel exposure compared with wild-type counterparts,
arguing ABCC10 functions as a major determinant of taxane sensitivity in mice. To better understand the
mechanistic basis of ABCC10 action, we characterized the biochemical and vectorial transport properties of
this protein. Using crude membranes in an ABCC10 overexpression system, we found that the ABCC10
transport substrates estrogen estradiol-glucuronide (E217bG) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) signiﬁcantly
stimulated ABCC10 beryllium ﬂuoride (BeFx)-sensitive ATPase activity. We also deﬁned the E217bG
antagonist, tamoxifen, as a novel substrate and stimulator of ABCC10. In addition, a number of cytotoxic
substrates, including docetaxel, paclitaxel, and Ara-C, increased the ABCC10 basal ATPase activity. We
determined that ABCC10 localizes to the basolateral cell surface, using transepithelial well assays to establish
that ABCC10-overexpressing LLC-PK1 cells exported [3H]-docetaxel from the apical to the basolateral side.
Importantly, we found that the clinically valuable multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, and a natural alkaloid,
cepharanthine, inhibited ABCC10 docetaxel transport activity. Thus, concomitant use of these agents might
restore the intracellular accumulation and potency of ABCC10-exported cytotoxic drugs, such as paclitaxel.
Overall, our work could seed future efforts to identify inhibitors and other physiologic substrates of ABCC10.

Introduction
The phenomenon of multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a
substantial problem in the chemotherapeutic treatment of
cancer. One important contributing factor in MDR is the
overexpression of a class of efﬂux pumps known as ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporters. The C subfamily of ABC
proteins is alternatively known as the ABCC proteins, or the
multidrug resistance protein (MRP) subfamily. Members of
this subfamily confer resistance to and transport several
classes of chemotherapeutics including taxanes, vinca alkaloids, camptothecans, and nucleoside analogs, as well as
physiologic substrates including leukotrienes and glutathione
(1, 2). This ABCC group consists of 9 family members conserving a common structural organization that includes at
least 2 transmembrane domains (TMD) and nucleotide-binding domains (NBD; ref. 2). The ABCC subfamily is further
divided into 2 groups: ABCC1 (MRP1), ABCC2 (MRP2), ABCC3

(MRP3), ABCC6 (MRP6), and ABCC10 (MRP7) have additional
N-terminal transmembrane domains, whereas ABCC4 (MRP4),
ABCC5 (MRP5), ABCC11 (MRP8), and ABCC12 (MRP9) do not
(2).
ABCC10 consists of 3 TMDs and 2 NBDs, and is one of the
least well-characterized family members (3), although we and
others have shown that ABCC10 tissue expression is widespread (4). Recent work has suggested that ABCC10 expression
level is elevated in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in
relation to normal lung, with ABCC10 expression in adenocarcinoma correlated with tumor grade and stage (5). Supporting a potential role for ABCC10 in control of the response of
tumors to the administration of therapeutics, we have previously shown that overexpression of ABCC10 in vitro confers
resistance to an unusually wide range of clinically valuable
drugs, including taxanes, vinca alkaloids, nucleoside analogs,
and epothilone B (6–8). Excitingly, we have recently used
a newly developed Abcc10/ mouse model to show that
absence of this transporter in vivo sensitizes animals to taxanes, with Abcc10/ mice experiencing increased sensitivity (i.e., neutropenia, and bone marrow hypoplasia) as compared with their wild-type counterparts following paclitaxel
treatment.
Together, these ﬁndings suggest that modulation of ABCC10
activity by inhibitors may have clinical value in management of
human cancers, such as NSCLC. Currently ATPase activities
have been described for some of the longer ABCC subfamily
members, including ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, and ABCC6

(9–12) and also for ABCC4 (13). However, to date, neither the
enzymatic activity of the ABCC10 ATPase nor the mechanistic
basis for ABCC10 transport of substrates have been substantially investigated. This study addresses these points, by
characterizing the effects of modulators on biochemical and
transport properties of ABCC10.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
LLC-PK1 cells were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) 7 years ago. All ATCC cell lines
undergo authentication tests during the accessioning process using methods described in the online ATCC brochure
Maintaining High Standards in Cell Culture. These characterizations are applied to the ﬁnal seed and distribution stocks
of cell lines for certiﬁcation include testing viability of the
cell population just before freezing and immediately after
thawing by Trypan-blue dye exclusion test. Observations of
recovery and growth are recorded along with morphologic
appearance. The ATCC also uses isoenzymology and/or the
cytochrome C subunit I (COI) PCR assay is conducted for
species conﬁrmation. Cells were passaged in our laboratory
for fewer than 3 months after receipt or resuscitation. The
High Five cell line was purchased 3 years ago from Invitrogen. Cells were passaged in our laboratory for fewer than 3
months after receipt or resuscitation. These cells have not
been authenticated.

Expression and identiﬁcation of ABCC10, ABCB1 and
ABCC1 in High Five insect cells
High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were infected with the
recombinant baculovirus containing the ABCB1 (Addgene
plasmid 10957), ABCC1 or ABCC10 cDNA. To create the recombinant baculovirus, ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCC10 cDNA
were cloned into pFastBac CT-TOPO vector (Invitrogen).
Crude membranes were prepared as previously described
(14) and used in subsequent ATPase assays. Total protein
was estimated using an Amido Black protein-ﬁlter assay of
Schaffner and Weissmann with BSA as a standard. The
membrane fraction was then resuspended to a concentration of 1 mg/mL and stored at 80 C until use. Crude
membranes were electrophoresed on a 3% to 8% NuPAGE
gel (Invitrogen) and stained with Colloidal blue (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer's instructions. Following electrotransfer to nitrocellulose paper, blots were probed with
the previously described ABCC10 monoclonal antibody at a
dilution of 1:10 (7) or the previously described Abcc10
polyclonal antibody (15) at a dilution of 1:3,000 and an
anti-ABCC1 mouse monoclonal QCRL-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at a dilution of 1:100.
Preparation of membranes
Total cell membranes were prepared from LLC-PK1 cells by
Dounce homogenization in Plasma Membrane (PM) PM-buffer
(1 mol/L HEPES, 1 mol/L MgCl2, and 1 mol/L KCl) containing
protease inhibitors: 5 mg/mL aprotinin, 5 mg/mL leupeptin, 2
mg/mL pepstatin, 100 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride
(PMSF). Intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation
at 500  g for 10 minutes at 4 C, and then the supernatant spun
at 3,000  g for 10 minutes at 4 C. Cell membranes were
pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000  g for 45 minutes at 4 C
and resuspended in PM-buffer.
For immunoblot analysis, 10 to 40 mg of membrane proteins
was analyzed on a 8% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to
nitrocellulose ﬁlters using a wet transfer system, as described
previously (16). The blots were incubated with the previously
described ABCC10 monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:10 (7)
or the previously described Abcc10 polyclonal antibody (15).
After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) secondary goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin
G (IgG; NEN). b-Actin-HRP (Abcam) conjugated antibody was
used at a dilution of 1:5,000.
Beryllium ﬂuoride-induced [a-32P]-8-azidoADP
trapping in ABCC10
Beryllium ﬂuoride (BeFx)-induced [a-32P]-8-azidoADP trapping assays contained ATPase assay buffer, 0.5 mmol/L
BeFx, 20 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mg/mL of membrane ABCC10, and
100 mmol/L [a-32P]-8-azidoATP (2.5–10 mCi/nmol; Afﬁnity
Photoprobes, LLC). Reactions were preincubated in low light
in the absence of [a-32P]-8-azidoATP at 37 C for 3 minutes,
initiated by the addition of [a-32P]-8-azidoATP and quenched
by adding ice-cold ATP (100 mmol/L). Reactions were irradiated by UV light (365 nm wavelength) on ice for 10 minutes
and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and after drying, the gel was
exposed to ﬁlm for 12 to 72 hours.

ABCC10 Biochemistry, Transport, and Localization of ABCC10

Measurement of ATPase activity
ATPase activity was measured by the endpoint inorganic
phosphate (Pi) assay as previously described (17). ABCC10-,
ABCB1- and ABCC1-speciﬁc activity was recorded as vanadate- or BeFx-sensitive ATPase activity. The amount of inorganic phosphate released over 20 minutes at 37 C was measured. 2 ATPase assay buffer (100 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 1
mol/L KCl, 0.25 mol/L sodium azide, 0.125 mol/L EGTA, 1
mmol/L ouabain, and 1 mol/L dithiothreitol (DTT)) was
combined with 2 mol/L MgCl2, 5 to 10 mg of membrane protein,
and various drugs or substrates for a 5-minute preincubation at
37 C. The reaction was initiated by 5 mmol/L ATP addition and
quenched with 100 mL of 5% SDS. The amount of Pi released
was quantitated using a previously described colorimetric
method (13). Kinetic parameters were determined by linear
regression analysis of the Lineweaver–Burk transformation of
the data by using GraphPad Prism 4 software. Velocity (V) ¼
Vmax [S]/([S] þ Km), in which: Vmax is the limiting velocity as
substrate concentrations get very large. [S] is concentration of
substrate; Km is the concentration of substrate that leads to
half-maximal velocity (in mol/L). All data were statistically
analyzed with a Student unpaired t test, and P values less than
0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Drug accumulation
For drug accumulation, control LLC-pcDNA 3.1 cells,
ABCC10-transfected LLC-ABCC10-11, and LLC-ABCC10-16
cells were seeded in duplicate at a density of 2  105 cells per
well in a 6-well plate. The next day, the media was replaced with
media containing 0.1 mmol/L [3H]-docetaxel (5 Ci/mmol,
Movarek) to a ﬁnal concentration and cells were incubated
at 37 C. For inhibition studies, the cells were preincubated
with the modulators cepharanthine (5 mmol/L) or tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI) as indicated in the results (2.5 mmol/L)
for 1 hour. After preincubation, the solution was removed and
labeled substrate with modulators was added to the well for 15,
30, and 60 minutes incubation at 37 C. After incubation, cells
were washed with ice-cold PBS and trypsinized. An aliquot of
cells was used to determine cell number, and the remaining
cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS. Each sample
was placed in scintillation ﬂuid to measure the radioactivity in
a liquid scintillation counter. All data were statistically analyzed with a Student unpaired t test, and P values less than 0.05
were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Transepithelial transport
Cells were seeded on microporous polycarbonate membrane ﬁlters (3.0-mm pore size, 6.5-mm insert, Transwell
3415, Costar) at a density of 1  106 cells per well for LLCPK1 cells in 24-well plates. The cells were grown for 7 days in
complete medium, with medium replacement after day 1 and
then every 2 days until the day of the experiment. Once the
transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) reached more than
500 Wcm2 and when Lucifer yellow rejection reached 97% to
100% (18, 19), the experiment was started by adding Hank's
Balanced Salt Solution(HBSS)-containing 0.1 mmol/L [3H]docetaxel (5 Ci/mmol) to either the apical or basolateral side.
For the inhibition study, after washing steps, the cells were

www.aacrjournals.org

preincubated with modulators for 1 hour. After incubation, the
solutions were aspirated and labeled substrate was added to
the donor chamber, while reﬁlling fresh modulator solution in
both chambers. The cells were incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2,
and 25 mL aliquots were taken from the receiver side at 0, 2, 6,
12, 20, and 30 minutes, and placed in scintillation ﬂuid to
measure the radioactivity in liquid scintillation counter. The
apparent permeability coefﬁcient (Papp) was calculated as
previously described (19). All data were statistically analyzed
with a Student unpaired t test, and P values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy
LLC-PK ABCC10 transfectants were grown on cover slips for
approximately 3 days until cells reached conﬂuency. After PBS
washing, ﬁxation, solubilization, and blocking, cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal C-terminus-ABCC10 antibody
(diluted 1:50 in blocking buffer; ref. 15) and mouse antib-catenin (dilution 1:500; BD Transduction Laboratories) for
1 hour at room temperature. Secondary antibody included
anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa-488 and anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa-568. 40 ,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) was used to stain DNA at a dilution of
1:2,000. The cells were mounted on a glass slide with ProLonged Antifade Reagent (Molecular probes). Confocal laser
scanning microscopy was conducted with a Nikon C1 spectral
confocal microscope (Nikon).

Results
Expression and identiﬁcation of human ABCC10 and
ABCC1 in High Five insect cells
To support study of ABCC10 ATPase activity, ABCC10 and
ABCC1 (a well-characterized transporter used as a positive
control; refs. 20, 21) were overexpressed using a baculovirus
system. ABCC10 and ABCC1 were readily detected in crude
membrane fractions as full-length proteins, with almost no
truncation or degradation byproducts (Fig. 1A and B). Puriﬁed ABCC10 bound effectively to the nucleotide analog
[a-32P]-8-azidoATP, conﬁrming structural integrity of the
NBDs (13; Fig. 1C).
Basal properties of ABCC10-mediated ATP hydrolysis
ABCC10 ATPase activity was measured using an Pi release
assay (17), with ouabain, EGTA, and sodium azide added to
crude membrane preparations to eliminate confounding Naþ
/Kþ, Ca2þ and mitochondrial ATPase activity, as in ref. (22).
Under these conditions, the basal rate of ATP hydrolysis of
ABCC10 ranged from 5.5 to 12 nmol/min/mg protein (Fig. 2A
and data not shown), depending on the preparation. For
reference, ABCC1 activity was 5 to 10 nmol/min/mg protein
using puriﬁed and reconstituted protein (9), and approximately 4 to 5 nmol/min/mg protein in our system (data not shown).
The noncovalent ATPase inhibitors Vi and BeFx replace phosphate during ATP hydrolysis, and stabilize a speciﬁc, transition
state conformation, inhibiting ATPase activity; prior work has
shown individual ABC transporters respond differently to
these inhibitors, reﬂecting differences in catalytic activity
(13, 23, 24). We determined that ABCC10 ATPase activity is

cation dependent; we established a rank order preference of
Mn2þ>Mg2þ>Ca2þ>Co2þ (Fig. 2E), with Mn2þ increasing
ATPase activity by 52% as compared with Mg2þ.

170 kDa (6, 17). B, colloidal blue staining of (i) 20 mg or (ii) 10 mg of

more sensitive to BeFx than Vi (32% and 11.4% inhibition,
respectively; Fig. 2A and B). For ABCC1, the BeFx-dependent
inhibition was almost 2-fold more effective than Vi inhibition
(60% vs. 35%, respectively), in accordance with previously
reported values (25; Fig. 2A and B).
Environmental pH can signiﬁcantly affect transporter
ATPase activity (19, 22, 26–28). Optimal ABCC10 ATPase
activity occurred at pH 7.5 (Fig. 2C), comparable with that
reported for ABCC1 (9). Titration of ATP revealed maximal
ABCC10 activity at a concentration of approximately 6 mmol/L
(Fig. 2D). We analyzed the kinetics over a concentration range
from 0 to 8 mmol/L ATP using a Lineweaver–Burk analysis. We
determined that the ABCC10 Km value for ATP binding is 3.2
mmol/L, in contrast to a 0.1 mmol/L Km value of ABCC1 (25).
ABCC10 ATPase activity was inhibited at [ATP] more than 9
mmol/L. Prior work on other ATPases have observed similar
inhibitory effects under conditions where other factors
required for catalysis, such as [Mg2þ], are present in limiting
concentrations (29). Discrete ATPases typically have varying
requirements for divalent cations during ATP hydrolysis
(13, 30). As anticipated, ABCC10-mediated ATP hydrolysis is

Dose-dependent induction of ABCC10 ATPase activity by
physiologic substrates and anticancer agents
LTC4, the estrogen estradiol-glucuronide (E217bG) and glutathione are physiologic substrates for ABCC1, and induce
ABCC1 ATPase activity (31, 32). We tested these compounds
for activation of ABCC10, using the crude membrane system
described earlier. We found that LTC4 and E217bG induced
ABCC10 ATPase activity by 79.7% and 30%, respectively (Fig. 3A
and C). Maximal induction of ABCC10 ATPase activity was
observed for LTC4 at 1 mmol/L. Further analyses of the effect of
LTC4 on ABCC10 ATPase activity revealed that at concentrations less than 1 mmol/L, the Km ¼ 0.057 mmol/L for LTC4 (Fig.
3C inset). The compound tamoxifen is frequently used in breast
cancer treatments as an estrogen receptor antagonist, based
on competition with estradiol. Interestingly, we found that
tamoxifen is also a modest substrate for ABCC10, and at lower
tamoxifen concentrations (less than 2 mmol/L) the Km ¼ 0.078
mmol/L (Fig. 3B inset). However, at higher concentrations LTC4
and tamoxifen both inhibited ABCC10 ATPase activity. In
contrast, glutathione had no signiﬁcant effect on ABCC10
ATPase activity at approximately 1 mmol/L, a concentration
stimulatory for ABCC1 (Fig. 3D). As controls, we conﬁrmed
that leukotriene C4 and glutathione are ATPase-inducing
substrates for ABCC1 (Fig. 3E and F; refs. 9, 20, 21). Taken
together, these data indicate that while LTC4 and E217bG
interact similarly with the ABCC1 and ABCC10 ATPase
domains, glutathione does not stimulate ABCC10 ATPase
activity. We observed that at high concentrations all substrates
inhibited ABCC1 and ABCC10 ATPase activity as previously
described for ABCB1 (33). It has been previously described that
ABC transporter substrates can be categorized into 3 distinct
types: (i) agents that stimulate ATPase activity at low concentration but inhibit activity at high concentration; (ii) agents
that enhance ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner; and
(iii) agents that inhibit ATPase activity (as for ABCB1; ref. 34).
Therefore, the ABCC10 substrates LTC4, and E217bG are
classiﬁed into the ﬁrst group and glutathione falls into the
third class of agents.
We have shown that the growth of ABCC10-transfected
HEK293 cells is resistant to taxanes, vinca alkaloids, the nontaxane antimicrotubule agent epothilone, and the nucleoside
analog Ara-C, but not to cisplatin (7, 35). We assessed the drugstimulatable ATPase activity of ABCC10 using 2 drug concentrations (0.625 and 5 mmol/L) of the taxanes (docetaxel and
paclitaxel), Ara-C, epothilone B, and cisplatin. We used vector
transfected pFastBac membranes as a control, and ABCB1overexpressing membranes for comparison (Fig. 4A–C). A
maximal 31.8% stimulation in activity of ABCC10 was induced
by Ara-C at a concentration of 0.625 mmol/L and (Fig. 4A). At 5
mmol/L, paclitaxel, and docetaxel stimulated ABCC10 ATPase
activity by 15% and 24.38%, respectively (Fig. 4B), whereas in
contrast, these compounds stimulated ABCB1 ATPase activity
by 63% and 36%, respectively. However, the basal ATPase
activity for ABCB1 was reduced 3-fold in comparison with

affect ABCC10 ATPase activity, even though overexpressed
ABCC10 causes resistance to this compound (7). As expected,
the negative control cisplatin, a nonsubstrate (6), did not
inﬂuence the ATPase activity ATPase activity of ABCC10 or
ABCC1.
Localization and docetaxel transport properties of
ABCC10 in polarized LLC-PK1 cells
ABC transporters variously localize to the apical or basolateral cell surface, affecting their transport properties (36,
37). To study the localization and transport properties of
ABCC10, we overexpressed ABCC10 in a polarized pig kidney
epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1 (Fig. 5A). ABCC10 localized
predominantly to the basolateral membranes in 2 independent ABCC10-overexpressing LLC-PK1 derivative cell lines
(Fig. 5B).
As anticipated, these ABCC10-overexpressing cell lines
exhibited reduced accumulation of [3H]-docetaxel compared
with parental vector-transfected LLC-pcDNA3.1 cells (51% and
63%, respectively, at 60 minutes time point; Fig. 6A). A transepithelial well assay was used to assess transport of [3H]docetaxel initially added to either the apical or the basolateral
side of a cell monolayer. Polarized LLC-PK1 ABCC10-over-

expressing cells line predominantly exported [3H]-docetaxel
from the apical to the basolateral side (Fig. 6B). While the
parental cell line revealed no differences between apical-tobasolateral or basolateral-to-apical docetaxel transport, in
contrast, we found that apical-to-basolateral transport of
ABCC10-overexpressing derivative cell lines were 70% to
80% higher than for LLC-PK1 parental apical-to-basolateral
transport. These data correlated with the localization of
ABCC10 (Fig. 5); ABCC10's basolateral localization indicated
that ABCC10-dependent transport should be directional from
the apical-to-basolateral side.
Cepharanthine and TKIs modulate ABCC10 ATPase
activity, accumulation, and transcellular transport of
[3H]-docetaxel
The natural product cepharanthine has previously been
established as a modulator of ABCC10-dependent resistance
and transport activity (38). Clinically valuable TKIs, such as
imatinib, lapatinib, erlotinib, and nilotinib, have also been
shown to inhibit ABCC10 in vitro (39–41). We determined that
at 5 mmol/L, cepharanthine, sorafenib, imatinib, nilotinib,

ATPase activity of ABCC10 at any concentration tested.
Treatment of ABCC10-overexpressing cells (LLC-ABCC1011 and LLC-ABCC10-16) with 5 mmol/L cepharanthine significantly increased accumulation of [3H]-docetaxel (by 48.4%
and 22.5%, at 60 minutes, respectively), compared with accumulation levels without inhibitor. In contrast, 2.5 mmol/L
sorafenib increased [3H]-docetaxel accumulation by 22.4% in
LLC-ABCC10-16 cells and by 49% in LLC-ABCC10-11 cells,
compared with accumulation levels without inhibitor (Fig.
7B). A total of 2.5 mmol/L dasatinib also increased [3H]docetaxel intracellular accumulation without signiﬁcant
effects on ABCC10 ATPase activity. Conversely, 2.5 mmol/L
lapatinib (a reported ABCC10 reversal agent (40) did not affect
the accumulation levels of docetaxel but decreased ABCC10
ATPase activity. Other TKIs with reported activity in inhibiting
ABCC10, such as nilotinib and erlotinib, only affected [3H]docetaxel accumulation of the LLC-ABCC10-11 cell line,
whereas imatinib only inhibited the LLC-ABCC10-16 cell line
(Fig. 7B). Interestingly, nilotinib, dasatinib, imatinib, and lapa-

tinib signiﬁcantly decreased [3H]-docetaxel accumulation of
the parental LLC-pcDNA3.1 cell line, indicating additional
activities not targeted at ABCC10.
Because our data revealed that [3H]-docetaxel accumulation
was signiﬁcantly inhibited by sorafenib in both transfectants,
we tested if sorafenib could also inhibit ABCC10-transepithelial transport using cepharanthine as a positive control. We
showed that cepharanthine was the most potent inhibitor of
ABCC10-mediated [3H]-docetaxel accumulation in both transfectants (Fig. 7B). Finally, we also established that transepithelial apical-to-basolateral transport of labeled docetaxel was
inhibited by 5 mmol/L cepharanthine in LLC-ABCC10-16 (Fig.
7C). A total of 2.5 mmol/L sorafenib maximally inhibited apicalto-basolateral transport for the LLC-ABCC10-16 cell line at 6 to
30 minutes (Fig. 7C).

Discussion
To date, the localization, biochemical, and transport properties of ABCC10 have been largely unexplored, with the
exception of a single study that used a membrane vesicle

ABCC1 (6). Our characterization of ABCC10 basal activity
revealed that ABCC10 was far less sensitive to vanadate
(11%) or BeFx (32%) inhibition than ABCC1 (35% and 60%,
respectively), or the other major taxane pump, ABCB1, which
has been reported to be completely inhibited (43). Taken
together, these data imply that the catalytic cycle of ABCC10
differs from the well-described cycles of ABCC1 and ABCB1. As
anticipated, we found that ABCC10 ATPase activity is stimulated by its substrates, the taxanes and Ara-C, similar to the
best-described taxane pump, ABCB1 (44). Surprisingly, however, the extremely weak ABCC10 transport substrate LTC4,
stimulated ABCC10 activity signiﬁcantly more than ABCC1
activity (80% vs. 30%), even though LTC4 is a well-established physiologic substrate for ABCC1. This unexpected result
further highlights differences between these proteins, and
emphasizes the need for further study (9, 45).

Knowledge of intracellular distribution is important for
understanding the potential effects of ABCC10-mediated
transport in normal tissues, and to provide insight with
respect to putative substrates. In the present study, we have
shown that ABCC10 localizes basolaterally when ectopically
expressed in the LLC-PK1 kidney cell line, similar to the
localization reported for ABCC1 in small intestine and
kidney cells. In contrast, ABCB1 localizes apically in brain,
liver, small intestine, and kidney (46, 47). ABCC10 transcript
expression is widespread, with highest levels detected in the
gonads and spleen (7). The ABCC10 transcript has been
detected in multiple types of adenocarcinoma that are
routinely treated with taxanes, including breast, ovary, and
lung (4, 48). Recent studies have shown that ABCC10 is also
upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma compared with
normal adjacent healthy liver samples (49), and that ABCC10
gene levels in colorectal tumors correlate with tumor grade
(P ¼ 0.01; ref. 50), implying that increased ABCC10 expression might be a biomarker for and regulator of treatment
response in certain cancers. However, besides a single study
examining ABCC10 protein expression in lung cancer (5), no
studies have been published about ABCC10 protein expression. It will be of considerable interest to assess ABCC10
protein expression levels in tumors versus normal tissues in
the context of treatment with taxanes.
Our recent work has indicated that loss of Abcc10 function in vivo causes taxane sensitization (15). In this report,
we have shown that cepharanthine and sorafenib (an agent
used to treat unresectable and advanced hepatocellular
carcinoma) were effective inhibitors of ABCC10 ATPase
activity. Likewise, we showed that cepharanthine increased
docetaxel accumulation in ABCC10-overexpressing cells and
inhibited apical-to-basolateral transport, particularly at early timepoints (at 6–12 minutes). Interestingly, we found that
sorafenib promoted increased [H3]-docetaxel accumulation
in 2 LLC-ABCC10 transfectants. The identiﬁcation of sorafenib as an ABCC10 inhibitor suggests that in vivo action of
this inhibitor may involve modulation of ABCC10-dependent
docetaxel transport. Currently, no identiﬁed inhibitors have
been shown to have in vivo efﬁcacy against ABCC10; an
important goal for future work would be the exploration of
the ability of sorafenib, cepharanthine, and other putative
inhibitors to modulate in vivo taxane transport capabilities
of ABCC10 in preclinical models. ABCC10 inhibition is
particularly nominated as a potentially high value target
for inhibition based on its physiologic relevance to in vivo
taxane resistance. The loss of no other single transporter
(including ABCB1) has resulted in tissue sensitization to
taxanes, suggesting no other transporter can be upregulated
to compensate for Abcc10 loss (15). Whether absence of
ABCC10 sensitizes solid tumors to taxanes while not leading
to unacceptable toxicity in normal tissue remains to be
determined. These investigations are currently ongoing in
our laboratory.
In summary, this study provided the ﬁrst analysis of ABCC10
ATPase activity, showed that ABCC10 localized basolaterally in
a polarized kidney cell line, and conﬁrmed this localization by
showing apical-to-basolateral transport. Importantly, we also
