Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Mutations in Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 are among the most common genetic
alterations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC), a deadly liver cancer1–5. Mutant IDH
proteins in IHCC and other malignancies acquire an abnormal enzymatic activity allowing them to
convert alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which inhibits the activity of
multiple αKG-dependent dioxygenases, and results in alterations in cell differentiation, survival,
and extracellular matrix maturation6–10. However, the molecular pathways by which IDH
mutations lead to tumour formation remain unclear. Here we show that mutant IDH blocks liver
progenitor cells from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation through the production of 2HG and
suppression of HNF4α, a master regulator of hepatocyte identity and quiescence.
Correspondingly, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) expressing mutant IDH in the
adult liver show aberrant response to hepatic injury, characterized by HNF4α silencing, impaired
hepatocyte differentiation and markedly elevated levels of cell proliferation. Moreover, mutant
IDH and activated Kras, genetic alterations that co-exist in a subset of human IHCCs4,5, cooperate
to drive the expansion of liver progenitor cells, development of premalignant biliary lesions, and
progression to metastatic IHCC. These studies provide a functional link between IDH mutations,
hepatic cell fate, and IHCC pathogenesis, and present a novel GEMM of IDH-driven malignancy.

Gain-of-function IDH1/IDH2 mutations occur in ∼25% of IHCCs1,3–5 but have not been
identified in hepatocellular carcinomas (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) — liver
malignancies that exhibit bile duct and hepatocyte differentiation, respectively. To examine
the role of IDH mutations in liver tumourigenesis we isolated mouse hepatoblasts (HBs),
which are embryonic progenitors that give rise to hepatocytes and bile duct cells and show
correspondence to adult liver progenitors11,12. HBs expressing mutant IDH1 (R132C,
R132H) or IDH2 (R140Q, R172K) produced increased 2HG, but exhibited morphology and
proliferation rates indistinguishable from vector and IDH wild type (WT) controls (Extended
Data Fig. 1a–d). However, unlike control HBs, which underwent hepatocyte differentiation
when transferred from collagen-coated plates to uncoated plates13, forming hepatocyte
clusters, decreasing proliferation, and activating a large program of hepatocyte-specific
genes including Adh1 and Aldob, IDH mutant cells were refractory to differentiation (Fig.
1a–d, Extended Data Fig. 1e–g). IDH1-R132C and IDH2-R172K caused the most
pronounced effects, correlating with relative 2HG levels. Treatment of R132C-expressing
HBs with ML309 (AGI-5027), a specific inhibitor of mutant IDH114, attenuated 2HG
production (Extended Data Fig. 1h) and restored hepatocyte differentiation (Fig. 1e–f).
Conversely, differentiation of WT HBs was counteracted by (R)- or (S)-2HG octyl-esters
(Extended Data Fig. 1i–j). In contrast to the complete inhibition of hepatocyte
differentiation, mutant IDH did not impair biliary differentiation of HBs in matrigel (Fig. 1g,
Extended Data Fig. 1k–l). Thus, mutant IDH specifically blocks hepatocyte lineage
progression through 2HG production.
To uncover the molecular program underlying these defects, we examined the effect of
mutant IDH1/2 on the transcriptome of HBs grown on collagen. Transcriptional profiles of
mutant IDH 1 and 2 clustered together and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
demonstrated reduced expression of targets of HNF4α — a master transcriptional regulator
of hepatocyte differentiation12 — and of HNF1α which acts downstream of HNF4α15.

Moreover, canonical HNF4α and HNF1α binding sites were strongly enriched at the
promoters of differentially expressed genes (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a–c).

Author Manuscript

HNF4α has multiple isoforms expressed from separate promoters. The P2 promoter
(encoding Hnf4a7-9) is active in hepatoblasts and gradually extinguished in adult
hepatocytes, whereas the P1 promoter (encoding Hnf4a1-6) is hepatocyte-specific16.
Hnf4a7-9 mRNA and protein were reduced in IDH-mutant HBs, as was expression of
HNF4α targets (Extended Data Fig. 2d–g). Moreover, under hepatocyte differentiation
conditions, mutant IDH completely inhibited the pronounced induction of HNF4α1-6 and its
target OCLN that is observed in control cells (Fig. 2b–c, Extended Data Fig. 2h). Mutant
IDH or octyl-2HG treatment blocked Hnf4a1-6 mRNA induction, whereas AGI-5027
restored Hnfa1-6 levels in R132C-expressing cells (Extended Data Fig. 2i–k). Histone H3
lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4Me3) is associated with active transcription and was
specifically reduced at the P1 promoter in R132C HBs, consistent with the observed
silencing of Hnf4a1-6, whereas the repressive marks, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, were
unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 2l–m and data not shown). Significantly, HNF4α
knockdown impaired hepatocyte differentiation of WT HBs without inhibiting biliary
differentiation, whereas ectopic HNF4α expression rescued differentiation of IDH-mutant
cells (Fig. 2d–h, Extended Data Fig. 2n–o, 3a–b). Thus, mutant IDH alters the epigenetic
state of the P1 promoter — through targeting either direct regulators of the locus or more
upstream factors — and prevents induction Hnf4a1-6, thereby blocking hepatocyte lineage
progression. Notably, HNF4α and HNF1α have critical anti-proliferative and tumour
suppressor functions in the adult liver17–20, suggesting the relevance of this pathway to
mutant IDH-mediated tumourigenesis and prompting us to extend our studies in vivo.

We generated transgenic mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of IDH2-R140Q or
IDH2-R172K (Tet-R140Q, Tet-R172K strains) specifically in adult hepatocytes — R140Q
was detected in virtually all hepatocytes and R172K showed more scattered expression, and
liver 2HG levels were elevated (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d, 5a). Since mutant IDH blocks
liver progenitors from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation in vitro, we sought to address
whether it acts analogously in vivo to specifically override differentiation from a progenitor
cell state, or conversely, whether it broadly alters homeostasis of mature hepatocytes.
Although normally quiescent, the liver has extensive regenerative capacity following injury
involving replication of mature hepatocyte and biliary cells, or activation of bipotential
progenitors (oval cells) that may arise from either lineage11,21. In the absence of injury, TetR140Q mice were healthy up to 48 weeks, and had normal liver histology, marker
expression, proliferation, and liver function (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 5b, and data not
shown). By contrast, pronounced defects in restoration of hepatocyte differentiation were
observed in mice fed a diet containing 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidin (DDC) for
5 days then switched to normal diet for 3 weeks (Fig. 3a), a protocol causing hepatocyte cell
death and transient oval cell activation21,22. Hepatocyte markers including HNF4α were
downregulated 3–10-fold, while biliary markers were unchanged, and proliferation was
increased >40-fold relative to WT controls (Fig. 3b–d). Despite this depletion of mature
hepatocytes, no changes were seen in parameters of liver function (Extended Data Fig. 5c–d
and data not shown), consistent with the persistence of hepatocytes surviving short-term

DDC treatment and the established capacity of reduced hepatocyte numbers to maintain
normal physiology.

Serial analyses of WT and R140Q livers revealed comparable numbers of proliferating
periductal HNF4α−/CK19− oval cells at 1 week, and resolution of this population after 3
weeks (Extended Data Fig. 6a–b, and Fig. 3e–f). However, R140Q livers exhibited
prominent induction of proliferating non-periductal cells with hepatocyte morphology but
reduced or absent HNF4α expression (HNF4α+ and HNF4α−/CK19−), which persisted after
3 weeks (Fig. 3e–f, Extended Data Fig. 6a–d). Similar but more tempered phenotypes were
seen in Tet-R172K mice, consistent with focal transgene expression (Extended Data Fig. 6e–
f). Thus, mutant IDH specifically blocks restoration of hepatocyte differentiation following
acute liver injury, leading to aberrant proliferation in the hepatic parenchyma. As HNF4α
levels increase in liver progenitors undergoing hepatocyte commitment23,24, these
proliferating HNF4α-low/absent cells appear to be committed progenitors (derived from dedifferentiated hepatocytes or oval cells) whose differentiation to hepatocytes is subverted by
mutant IDH2. The transgene was not expressed in Sox9+ oval cells, precluding assessment
of effects on these earlier progenitors.

Author Manuscript

We developed an additional transgenic strain (LSL-R172K) expressing human IDH2-R172K
in Sox9+ biliary cells but not in hepatocytes (Fig. 3g, Extended Data Fig. 7a–b). These
animals displayed normal liver histology, gene expression, and proliferation at 3 months
(Extended Data Fig. 7c and data not shown). However, by 20 months of age there was
pronounced accumulation of Hnf4α−/Sox9+ oval cells expressing R172K >25µm away from
any bile duct or portal structure (zones 2/3) (Fig. 3g). Collectively, our results suggest that
mutant IDH2 abrogates differentiation of adult progenitors (activated spontaneously during
aging or by injury), specifically blocking hepatocyte lineage progression.

Author Manuscript

These findings are concordant with our observations in HB cells and suggest that failed
HNF4α induction could contribute to the liver phenotypes caused by mutant IDH in vivo. In
this regard, acute HNF4α deletion in hepatocytes is reported to provoke hepatocyte
differentiation defects and, upon diethylnitrosamine (DEN) treatment, oval cell
accumulation and formation of tumours showing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and IHCC
morphology20. To expand upon potential parallels with IDH-mutant mice, we characterized
these phenotypes in further depth. Significantly, the HCC lesions in DEN-treated HNF4a
conditional KO mice were uniformly HNF4α+, indicating that they arose from cells that
escaped deletion of the locus (Extended Data Fig. 8a). By contrast, Sox9+ oval cells and
CK19+ IHCCs were HNF4α-negative and were never observed in DEN-treated controls
(Extended Data Fig. 8b–c). Thus, HNF4α ablation in DEN-treated livers drives progenitor
expansion and progression specifically to IHCC. These findings establish Hnf4a as an IHCC
tumor suppressor and are consistent with HNF4α acting downstream of mutant IDH in liver
growth control.
The capacity of mutant IDH to silence Hnf4a and impair differentiation would be expected
to confer sensitivity to transformation by additional oncogenic lesions. In this regard, IDH
and KRAS mutations exist concurrently in human IHCC4,5 and AML25. Previously, we
showed that KrasG12D expression in mouse liver causes mixed IHCC/HCC with long

latency, a phenotype accelerated by p53 deletion26. Intercrossing LSL-R172K, KrasG12D and
Alb-Cre mice revealed dramatic oncogenic cooperation, with 6/6 Alb-Cre; LSL-R172K;
KrasG12D animals developing poor body condition and palpable liver tumours between 33
and 58 weeks (mean 47.3 weeks; Fig. 4a). Multifocal liver masses with splenic invasion and
peritoneal metastases were observed and demonstrated to be IHCC by histopathologic
analysis, CK19 staining, and lack of reactivity for the hepatocyte/HCC marker, Hep Par1
(Fig. 4b). By contrast, only 1/7 Alb-Cre; KrasG12D mice sustained a tumour by 70 weeks
(mean survival = 81.6 weeks), and solely HCC were detected (Extended Data Fig. 8d).
Tumour 2HG levels in R172K mice were comparable to those in IDH-mutant human IHCC1
(Extended Data Fig. 8e).

Author Manuscript

In humans, IHCC is thought to develop from precursor lesions, including biliary
intraepithelial neoplasias (BilIN)2. Aberrant oval cell proliferation also precedes liver cancer
development in murine models27. Notably, in all Alb-Cre; LSL-R172K; KrasG12D mice
analyzed (N=6), the adjacent liver exhibited oval cell expansion and a graded series of
BilIN-like lesions, which were Sox9+/CK19+, and expressed the IDH2-R172K transgene at
physiologic levels (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 9a–b, 10a). Importantly, neither Alb-Cre;
KrasG12D nor Alb-Cre; KrasG12D; p53Lox/+ livers26 showed oval cell expansion, and BilIN
were found in only 2/8 Alb-Cre; KrasG12D; p53Lox/+ mice. Thus, IDH2-R172K and
KrasG12D cooperatively incite activation of hepatic progenitors and multistage IHCC
progression.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we present a novel GEMM driven by mutant IDH that exhibits the hallmarks of
human IHCC. Mutant IDH blocks hepatocyte differentiation from progenitors in vitro, and
regulates hepatic regeneration, progenitor cell expansion, and IHCC pathogenesis in vivo.
Collectively, our findings are consistent with a model whereby mutant IDH subverts the
HNF4α-mediated hepatocyte differentiation/quiescence program in proliferating
hepatocytes or bipotential progenitors, creating a persistent pre-neoplastic state primed for
transformation by additional oncogenic mutations, and leading to adenocarcinoma
specifically with a biliary phenotype (Fig. 4d). While lineage-tracing studies are required to
fully define the impact of IDH mutations on different liver cell types, this model predicts
that IDH-mutant IHCC may have progenitor-like features, and that IDH mutations occur
early in disease pathogenesis as observed in glioblastoma and AML28,29. Accordingly
GSEA revealed that IDH-mutant tumors have strong enrichment of a hepatic stem cell
expression signature (Extended Data Fig. 10b).

Author Manuscript

Defining the biologic functions of mutant IDH is of immediate significance as IHCCs are
resistant to current treatment. Our GEMM provides an autochthonous context for ‘coclinical trials’ to help determine the best way to deploy IDH inhibitors and identify
biomarkers of response, thereby informing clinical decision-making in this deadly disease.

HB cells were prepared from WT mice at embryonic day 14 and immortalized by plating at
clonal density13. HBs were maintained in HB media [DMEM/F-12 (Gibco Life
Technologies, Grand Island NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillinstreptomycin, 50ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 30 ng/mL insulin-like growth factor II
(PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 10 µg/mL insulin (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)] on plates
coated with rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) in a humidified atmosphere
with 5% CO2 at 37°C. For IDH1 experiments, culture media was supplemented with 25
ng/mL of doxycycline (d9891, Sigma-Aldrich). For hepatocyte differentiation assays, 5×106
HB cells were cultured on uncoated 10 cm tissue culture dishes in HB cell medium for up to
5 days. Pictures were taken 2–5 days after plating. For bile duct differentiation (matrigel)
assays, 0.5 mL of Basement Membrane Matrix (BD) was coated onto 6 cm tissue culture
dishes and allowed to set for 1h. Then 0.5×106 HB cells were added to the plate in HB cell
media supplemented with 100 ng/mL recombinant mouse hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Tubules were counted after 24hrs. For gene expression
analysis, cells were isolated after 10 days. For proliferation assays, cells were plated in
duplicate on collagen-coated 6 well dishes (1×104/well) or uncoated 6 well plates (1×105/
well) in culture medium. Adherent and non-adherent cells were harvested, trypsinized and
counted by trypan-blue exclusion using a Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen) 24,
72 or 120 hrs later. Negative mycoplasma contamination status of all cell lines and primary
cells used in the study was established using LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Kit (Sigma,
MP0035).

Doxycycline inducible models: To generate the doxycycline-inducible Tet-R140Q and TetR172K strains (Extended Data Fig. 4), IDH2-R140Q cDNA was cloned into the pBS31
Prime transgenic targeting vector (Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems, #MES4487). A
modified version of pBS31 containing a floxed stop cassette was used for the IDH2-R172K
mice. The targeting vectors were co-electroporated into C2 mouse embryonic stem cells
(Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems, #MES4305) with a plasmid expressing FLPE
recombinase (pCAGGS-FlpE, Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems, Waltham MA,
#MES4488) as described33. This system involves single copy integration of the transgene
downstream of the Collagen-1 locus, and within the liver, results in expression in
hepatocytes but not in bile ducts33. ES cells were screened for integration of the transgene
by PCR and correctly targeted ES cells were injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts. Chimeras
were crossed to the Albumin-Cre strain30, and offspring were successively crossed with
Rosa26-LSL-rtTA31, and LSL-KrasG12D mice32. We confirmed the expected expression of
the R140Q (Extended Data Figure. 4b–c) and R172K transgenes (Extended Data Fig. 4d) in
the adult hepatocytes and lack of expression in bile ducts. Stably expressed model: To
generate mice with a conditionally active IDH2-R172K allele (LSL-R172K), human IDH2R172K was cloned into a modified version of the PGK-ATG-Frt vector (Open Biosystems,

strain was successively crossed with Albumin-Cre and LSL-KrasG12D animals. This
transgene was specifically expressed in bile ducts and oval cells (Fig. 3g and Extended Data
Fig. 7b). We did not observe developmental anomalies in these mice, although the
inefficiency of recombination induced by the Alb-Cre strain in neonates and the restricted
activity of the transgene in this system precludes definitive assessment of potential effects of
mutant IDH2 on the embryonic liver.
DDC treatment

Author Manuscript

For DDC experiments, 4-week old mice were treated with 200 µg/mL doxycyclinecontaining water. 2 days later, mice were fed with 0.1% DDC-containing chow (F4643, Bioserv, Frenchtown, NJ) for 5 days. The mice were then switched to normal chow and
maintained on doxycycline-containing water until harvest 1 or 3 weeks later. Randomization
was done according to genotype and blinding was applied during histological analysis. No
mice were excluded from the analysis. Sample sizes were chosen to achieve statistical
significance yet use the fewest animals possible to minimize suffering.

Gene expression of HBs expressing IDH1 WT, IDH1 R132C, IDH2 WT, R172K and empty
vector controls (N=2 cultures for each condition) grown on collagen-coated plates, as well
as IDH1 R132C and empty vector controls grown on uncoated plates, was evaluated using
Affymetrix Mouse 430Av2 DNA microarrays (DFCI Microarray core facility). Raw
expression values were processed and normalized using RMA in the R Bioconductor
package. This dataset is available in GEO (GSE57002). Differentially expressed genes in
IDH1 R132C and IDH2 R172K expressing HBs were identified using the signal-to-noise
metric. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the expression data was used to uncover
the molecular program accounting for the differentiation defects. GSEA was performed
using two libraries from version 3.1 of the molecular signature database (http://
www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp): the c2 curated gene sets from online
pathway databases, PubMed publications, knowledge of domain experts and the c3 motif
gene sets. Pairwise GSEA analysis such as shown in Fig. 2a was performed by creating
ranked lists of genes using the log2 ratio of mutant IDH samples to vector or WT control
and running GSEA in the ranked list mode. The heat map in Fig. 2a presents the gene-sets
that distinguish IDH1 R132C or IDH2 R172K as compared to cells expressing WT IDH1 or
IDH2 or EV. Each column represents pairwise analysis of HB cells expressing mutant IDH
(IDH1 R132C or IDH2 R172K) with either EV (left columns) or WT IDH (right columns)
control cells for two independent replicates of each sample. All other results were obtained
using GSEA to rank genes according to signal-to-noise ratio between mutant IDH samples
and controls. Statistical significance for GSEA results were obtained from permuting gene
sets (1000 permutations). Gene sets of ‘Hepatocyte Genes’ for the GSEA results shown in
Extended Data Fig. 1g were created from expression data from Shin, et al. 201137. The
expression data was downloaded from GEO (GSE28891) in series matrix form and loaded
into R. Undifferentiated, differentiated hepatocytes, and primary hepatocyte samples were
selected from GSE28891 (4 samples of each type for a total of 12). Within that sample
subset, the normalized signal intensities were thresholded to a minimum value of 10 and
features were filtered out if they had less than 3 fold difference between minimum and
maximum values or had absolute differences less than 50 between minimum and maximum
values (leaving 21277 features out of 37908). A t-test was performed between the
undifferentiated and the combined differentiated and primary hepatocyte samples and pvalues from the t-test were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the BenjaminiHochberg correction (in R using the Bioconductor multtest package). This left 206 features
up and 407 down in the hepatocyte direction with an adjusted BH p-value < 0.01 which are
represented by 133 and 311 unique gene symbols respectively. 96 of these genes were
represented on the murine Affymetrix array. The feature list was made into a gene set
labeled as ‘Hepatocyte Genes’ and is shown in Supplementary Table 1.

Tissue samples were fixed overnight in 4% buffered formaldehyde, and then embedded in
paraffin and sectioned (5 µm thickness) by the DF/HCC Research Pathology Core.
Hematoxylin & eosin staining was performed using standard methods. For
immunohistochemistry, unstained slides were baked at 55°C overnight, deparaffinized in
xylenes (2 treatments, 6 min each), rehydrated sequentially in ethanol (5 min in 100%, 3 min
in 95%, 3 min in 75%, and 3 min in 40%), and washed for 5 min in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS
(PBST) and 3 min in water. For antigen unmasking, specimens were cooked in a 2100
Antigen Retriever (Aptum Biologics Ltd, Southampton, UK) in 1X Antigen Unmasking
Solution, Citric Acid Based (H-3300, Vector Laboratories), rinsed 3 times with PBST,
incubated for 10 min with 1% H2O2 at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase
activity, washed 3 times with PBST, and blocked with 5% goat serum in PBST for 1h.
Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution as follows: anti-R172K (26163, New
East Biosciences) 1:100, anti-R140Q (26165 New East Biosciences) 1:100, anti-IDH2
(NBP2-22166, Novus Biologicals) 1:100, anti-HNF4α monoclonal antibody (PP-K9218-00,

anti-Ki67 (ab15580, Abcam), 1:100 and incubated with the tissue sections at 4°C overnight.
Specimens were then washed 3 times for 3 min each in PBST and incubated with
biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) in blocking solution for 1h at room
temperature. Then, specimens were washed 3 times in PBST and treated with ABC reagent
(Vectastain ABC kit #PK-6100) for 30 min, followed by 3 washes for 3 min each. Finally,
slides were stained for peroxidase for 3 min with the DAB (Di-amine-benzidine) substrate
kit (SK-4100, Vector Laboratories), washed with water and counterstained with
hematoxylin. Stained slides were photographed with an Olympus DP72 microscope. For
Immunofluorescence studies of tissue specimens, antigen unmasking was performed in 1X
Antigen Retrieval Buffer, Tris-EDTA Buffer, pH 9.0 (ab93684, Abcam), rinsed briefly with
dH2O, washed for 5min in PBS, followed by 5 min in 0.05% Tween-20/TBS (TBST).
Specimens were then blocked using 0.5% blocking reagent (FP1020, PerkinElmer) diluted
in TBS (TNB) for 1h and incubated in primary antibodies at 4°C overnight in TNB,
followed by 3 min washes in TBST and 1h incubation in secondary antibodies (1:400)
diluted in TNB. Finally, specimens were rinsed 3 × 5 min in TBST and mounted using
mounting media with DAPI (H-1500, Vectashield Vector Laboratories). For cell culture

X-100/PBS and blocked for 30 min with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2%
Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS). Coverslips were incubated with primary (1:100) and
secondary (1:1000) antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h and 40 min, respectively, at
room temperature, and nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.
Coverslips were mounted with immu-mount (Thermo-Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). The
following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Sox9 (1:500; Millipore AB5535); goat
anti-HNF4α (SC6556, 1:250; Santa Cruz). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to
Alexa-488, 555 or 647 (Life Technologies). Confocal images were captured by a scanning
laser confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti; Nikon) using 40× or 60× oil lenses and
captured using NIS-Elements software (Nikon). Images were processed using ImageJ and
Adobe Photoshop CS4. For quantification of signal intensity ratios, channel intensities of
individual cells were selected from at least 60 cells per sample from at 3- 5 images using the
Measure RGB plugin of ImageJ and exported into Excel for further analysis.
2HG production and measurement

Author Manuscript

2HG-octyl esters were prepared from commercially available 2HG lactones (CAS#
21461-84-7 (S-) and 53558-93-3 (R-)). Esterification of lactone with 1-octanol and EDCI
(CAS# 25952-53-8), followed by opening of the lactone with lithium hydroxide in
tetrahydrofuran/water, yielded the 2HG-octyl esters (free carboxylic acid) upon
neutralization and chromatographic purification. The sodium salts of both 2HG-octyl esters
are available from Toronto Research Chemicals. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using
an AB Sciex 4000 (Framingham, MA) operating in negative electrospray mode. MRM data
were acquired for each compound using the following transitions: 2HG (146.9/128.8 amu),
13C5-2HG (151.9/133.8 amu) and 3HMG (160.9/98.9 amu). Chromatographic separation
was performed using an ion-exchange column (Bio-Rad Fast Acid Analysis, 9µm, 7.8 mm X
100 mm; Bio-Rad). The flow rate was 1ml/min of 0.1 % formic acid in water with a total
run time of 4 minutes. Samples were prepared as follows: Tissues were weighed out and
homogenized in appropriate volumes of PBS using Tissue Lyser (Qiagen). 10µl of
homogenate were extracted by adding 200µl of methanol with 200 ng/ml 3HMG as internal
standard. Cell pellets containing 1×106 cells each were resuspended in specified volumes of
80:20 MeOH:water, centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000 rpm. 30µl of supernatant were
extracted by adding 170µl of methanol with 200 ng/ml 13C5-2HG as internal standard. All
sample types were then vortexed, centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 5°C and 150µl of supernatant
transferred to a clean 96-well plate. The samples were dried down and reconstituted in 200µl
0.1% formic acid in water, and 10 µl injected on a column.

Human samples and genomic studies
An initial cohort of 149 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples was obtained
from ICC patients resected between 1995 and 2007 at three centers from the HCC Genomic
Consortium: IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori (Milan), Mount Sinai School of Medicine
(New York), and Hospital Clinic (Barcelona). Pathological diagnosis of ICC was confirmed
by two independent liver pathologists (MS and ST). DNA and RNA extraction from human
tissue, whole-genome gene-expression profiling (DASL assay Illumina), and the Infinium
FFPE restoration kit (Illumina) are extensively described elsewhere36. The study protocol

was approved at each center’s Institutional Review Board. A total of 127 samples had
available data for both gene expression and DNA copy number changes and were analyzed
for molecular characterization to define molecular-based classes. IDH1 and 2 mutations
occurring at Arginine residue 132 and 172 respectively were analyzed by PCR technique
using primers 5’-GTGGCACGGTCTTCAGAGA-3’ (forward primer) and 5’TGCTTAATGGGTGTAGATACCAA-3’ (reverse primer), and 5’GCCCACACATTTGCACTCTA-3’ (forward primer) and 5’AAGGAAAGCCACGAGACAGA-3’ (reverse primer). The PCR amplifications were
performed in a volume of 25µL reaction mixture containing 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.2mM of each
dNTP, 0.125mM of each primer and 1U of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen).
PCR products were purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and
sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 3700 DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM® 3730XL;
Applied Biosystems). Good quality sanger sequencing data for both IDH1 and IDH2 was
obtained for 107 ICC DNA samples and has been included in all the subsequent analyses.
Human Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
Genes, molecular pathways, and gene expression signatures associated with the classes were
evaluated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for Molecular Signature Database
gene sets (MSigDB, www.broadinstitute.org/msigdb). Data analysis was conducted using
the GenePattern Analytical Toolkit37, whereas correlation with clinico-pathological
parameters was performed with SPSS software® (version 18) as previously described36.
