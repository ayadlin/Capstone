Abstract
Estrogen receptor α (ERα)–positive breast cancers that co-express transcription factors GATA-3 and FOXA1
have a favorable prognosis. These transcription factors form an autoregulatory hormonal network that influences estrogen responsiveness and sensitivity to hormonal therapy. Disruption of this network may be a mechanism whereby ERα-positive breast cancers become resistant to therapy. The transcription factor T-bet is a
negative regulator of GATA-3 in the immune system. In this study, we report that insulin increases the expression of T-bet in breast cancer cells, which correlates with reduced expression of GATA-3, FOXA1, and the
ERα:FOXA1:GATA-3 target gene GREB-1. The effects of insulin on GATA-3 and FOXA1 could be recapitulated
through overexpression of T-bet in MCF-7 cells (MCF-7-T-bet). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
revealed reduced ERα binding to GREB-1 enhancer regions in MCF-7-T-bet cells and in insulin-treated
MCF-7 cells. MCF-7-T-bet cells were resistant to tamoxifen in the presence of insulin and displayed prolonged
extracellular signal–regulated kinase and AKT activation in response to epidermal growth factor treatment.
ERα-positive cells with intrinsic tamoxifen resistance as well as MCF-7 cells with acquired tamoxifen and
fulvestrant resistance expressed elevated levels of T-bet and/or reduced levels of FOXA1 and GATA-3. Analysis
of publicly available databases revealed ERα-positive/T-bet–positive breast cancers expressing lower levels of
FOXA1 (P = 0.0137) and GATA-3 (P = 0.0063) compared with ERα-positive/T-bet–negative breast cancers.
Thus, T-bet expression in primary tumors and circulating insulin levels may serve as surrogate biomarkers
to identify ERα-positive breast cancers with a dysfunctional hormonal network, enhanced growth factor
signaling, and resistance to hormonal therapy. Cancer Res; 70(2); 685–96. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Gene expression studies have enabled classification of
breast cancers into different prognostic subgroups; intrinsic
subtype is one among them (1, 2). There are five intrinsic
subtypes: luminal type A, luminal type B, HER2/Neu-positive,
basal-like, and normal-like (3). Luminal type A cancers,
which express estrogen receptor α (ERα), have one of the
best prognosis, with a 90% 5-year survival rate (3). This is
partly attributed to their sensitivity to antiestrogen therapy.
However, resistance commonly develops to these hormonal
therapies over time. Luminal type B breast cancers, which

express either ERα or progesterone receptor (PR) and
ki67high, with few cases being HER2 positive, have worse
prognosis than luminal A cancers (4, 5).
Luminal type A tumors are characterized by elevated expression of three transcription factors: ERα, FOXA1, and
GATA-3 (3, 6). The co-expression of these three factors is
associated with a better prognosis (3, 7, 8). In vitro as well
as gene knockout studies have revealed a mutual interdependence of these factors for expression. For example,
FOXA1 is an estrogen-regulated gene, whereas GATA-3
and ERα regulate each other's expression (6, 9, 10).
GATA-3 is also essential for FOXA1 expression during
mammary development (11, 12). FOXA1 is recruited to
distal enhancer elements depending on the distribution of
histone H3 lysine 4 mono- and di-methylation; this facilitates ERα binding to regions that bind to both FOXA1
and ERα (13). Hence, FOXA1 is thought to be required
for the expression of ∼50% of the estrogen target genes
(9, 14). Similarly, GATA-3 binding sites are enriched in genomic regions that also bind to ERα (15). Based on their
interdependence, these three transcription factors are suggested to constitute a cell-lineage–specific hormonal transcription factor network (6).

McCune et al.

Most studies on antiestrogen resistance have focused on
the role of the ERα:estrogen axis, transcription co-regulatory
molecules, and the kinases that phosphorylate ERα and/or
co-regulatory molecules (16–18). However, signaling pathways that may disrupt the ERα:GATA-3:FOXA1 hormonal
network have received very little attention. GATA-3 was originally characterized as a signaling molecule involved in T-cell
differentiation (19) and subsequently found to have a role in
the differentiation of breast luminal progenitor cells (11). In
T cells, the transcription factor T-bet, also known as Tbx21, is
a negative regulator of GATA-3 activity (19). Whereas T-bet is
essential for the differentiation of T helper progenitors into
Th1 cells, GATA-3 performs an equivalent function in Th2
cells. T-bet prevents Th2 lineage commitment by inhibiting
GATA-3 DNA binding (20). T-bet is expressed in epithelial
cells of the female reproductive tract where, along with
GATA-3, it is expressed cyclically, suggesting a hormonally
regulated expression (21). From these studies, we considered
the possibility of T-bet regulating GATA-3 activity in breast
cancer cells and disrupting the ERα:GATA-3:FOXA1 signaling
network. Furthermore, with previous studies showing a role
for T-bet in insulin-dependent diabetes, we evaluated the
role of insulin in disrupting hormonal network (22–24). Serum insulin level is an independent prognostic factor in
breast cancer (25–28). We observed insulin-dependent overexpression of T-bet with subsequent reduction in GATA-3 expression in breast cancer cells. T-bet impaired estradiol (E2)
and tamoxifen response in ERα-positive breast cancer cells,
implicating its role in the progression of luminal A breast
cancers.

RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). For quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), RNA was reverse
transcribed using a single-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and subjected to quantitative PCR using SYBR Green
or TaqMan (for T-bet; Applied Biosciences). The primers used
were as follows: GREB-1, 5′-TGCCAGATGACAATGGCCACAATG-3′ (forward), 5′-TCTGCTTCTTGGGTTGAGTGGTCA3′ (reverse); XBP-1, 5′-AGTGAGCTGGAACAGCAAGTGGTA3′ (forward), 5′-AGCGCTGTCTTAACTCCTGGTTCT-3′ (reverse); GATA-3, 5′-ACACTCTGGAGGAGGAATGCCAAT-3′

BT-474) supplemented with 5% CCS and L-glutamine for
48 h before plating. Cells were plated in a 96-well plate
(1,000 per well) and treatment was initiated after 2 d with
subsequent medium change on the 5th day. Cell proliferation
was measured on the 7th day using bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) incorporation ELISA assay (Calbiochem).

Hormonal Transcription Factor Network in Breast Cancer

Results
T-bet is overexpressed in a subset of ERα-positive breast
cancers. To consider the possibility of T-bet, a negative regulator of GATA-3 activity in T cells (19), controlling the
function of hormonal network involving GATA-3 in breast
cancer, we first examined the expression pattern of T-bet
in the publicly available microarray databases. Although
T-bet is expressed at higher levels in ERα-negative breast
cancers compared with ERα-positive breast cancers, a subset of ERα-positive breast cancers expressed higher levels of
T-bet (Fig. 1A; ref. 30). Differences in the expression between T-bet–positive (n = 94) and T-bet–negative (n =
131) subgroups within ERα-positive breast cancer are statistically significant (P = 0.0001; Fig. 1B). Using the same data
set, we then analyzed the expression levels of GATA-3 and
FOXA1 in T-bet–positive and T-bet–negative subgroups. Tbet expression negatively correlated with FOXA1 (P =
0.0137) and GATA-3 (P = 0.0063; Fig. 1C). T-bet expression
was also associated with PR negativity (P < 0.00005; ref. 31),
a subgroup that is known to be associated with resistance
to endocrine therapy (ref. 32; Fig. 1D). Analysis of T-bet expression among ERα/PR-positive breast cancer patients
who received tamoxifen treatment in a different data set
revealed a trend of elevated T-bet expression in tumors of
patients with recurrence (n = 28) compared with patients
who were disease-free (n = 32) after 5 years of treatment,
although this did not reach statistical significance (P =
0.066; ref. 33). Because microarray analysis was done on laser capture microdissected tumor samples, this study shows
that T-bet is present in cancer cells.
Insulin induces T-bet and/or reduces GATA-3 and
FOXA1 expression. To determine whether T-bet is expressed
in breast cancer cell lines and the expression is regulated by
extracellular signals, we investigated the effects of growth
hormone, insulin, insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I
and IGF-II), epidermal growth factor (EGF), inflammatory cytokines, and E2 on T-bet expression in MCF-7 cells. Only insulin and IGF-I induced T-bet expression (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S1; data not shown). Insulin increased
T-bet mRNA levels, and this increase in mRNA correlated
with insulin-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of
signal transducer and activator of transcription-1, a transcription factor involved in T-bet expression (ref. 34; Supplementary Fig. S2A and B).
We next examined the effects of insulin on GATA-3 and
FOXA1 expression. If cross talk between T-bet and GATA-3
is similar in both T cells and breast epithelial cells, insulin
is expected to reduce the expression and/or activity of
GATA-3. As expected, insulin reduced the expression of
GATA-3 both at the protein (Fig. 2B) and the transcript levels (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Results of multiple experiments on the effects of insulin on T-bet, GATA-3, FOXA1,
and ERα proteins are shown in Fig. 2C. Insulin-mediated
reduction in GATA-3 correlated with a 30% reduction in
FOXA1 expression. However, it was noted that not all
MCF-7 variants or breast cancer cell lines showed insulindependent reduction of FOXA1 (see below).

www.aacrjournals.org

To determine the cell type specificity of insulin action, we
examined additional ERα-positive luminal A (T47-D) and luminal B (BT-474, MD-361, and ZR75-30) cell lines for T-bet,
GATA-3, FOXA1, and ERα expression (35). Luminal B phenotype seems to be associated with reduced or loss of GATA-3
expression (Fig. 2D). T-bet expression was markedly higher in
BT-474 cells compared with other cell lines (Fig. 2D). Insulin
reduced FOXA1 expression in T47-D and ZR75-30 cells by
∼30%. The GATA-3 dependency of FOXA1 expression is cell
type specific because all luminal B cell lines expressed significant FOXA1. Taken together, these results reveal a cell
type–specific association between T-bet, GATA-3, and
FOXA1 expression in breast cancer cells and the effects of
insulin on their expression.
T-bet overexpression in MCF-7 cells leads to altered E2
and tamoxifen response. To determine whether T-bet negatively regulates E2-inducible expression of specific ERα,
GATA-3, and FOXA1 target genes, we generated MCF-7 cells
overexpressing T-bet (MCF-7-T-bet; Fig. 3A). The expression
of GATA-3, FOXA1, and ERα was lower in MCF-7-T-bet
cells compared with parental (MCF-7p) cells, which is consistent with the effect of insulin on the expression of
GATA-3 and FOXA1. As with insulin, T-bet overexpression
resulted in lower levels of GATA-3 transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
XBP-1 is a potential downstream target of the ERα,
FOXA1, and GATA-3 network based on a meta-analysis and
contains binding sites for all three transcription factors (7,
14). Whereas E2 readily induced XBP-1 expression in MCF7p cells, it was markedly lower in T-bet–overexpressing cells
(Fig. 3B, left). E2-inducible expression of GREB-1, which also
contains both ERα and FOXA1 binding sites, was lower in
MCF-7-T-bet cells compared with MCF-7p cells, although
the magnitude of this effect was not as dramatic (Fig. 3B,
left). T-bet did not have an effect on E2-inducible expression
of EBP50, which suggests gene-specific effects of T-bet on E2regulated gene expression (data not shown).
We next investigated whether reduced E2-inducible expression of XBP-1 in MCF-7-T-bet cells correlates with
lower ERα binding to regulatory regions by performing a
ChIP assay. XBP-1 has three distinct enhancer elements
with ERα binding sites; enhancers 1 and 2 also contain
FOXA1 binding sites (Fig. 3C). E2-induced ERα binding to
all three ERα binding sites of XBP-1 was substantially lower in MCF-7-T-bet cells compared with MCF-7p cells (Fig.
3C). Like XBP-1, GREB-1 is associated with multiple ERα
binding sites; a few of these sites are enriched for FOXA1
binding (Fig. 3D). ERα binding to one of these binding
sites that we examined was lower in T-bet–overexpressing
cells compared with parental cells. Taken together, these
results suggest a negative effect of T-bet on ERα binding
to the genome.
To determine whether insulin can mimic T-bet overexpression on E2-induced expression of the above genes, we
pretreated MCF-7 cells with insulin overnight and then exposed the cells to ethanol or E2 for 4 hours. Insulin significantly reduced basal and E2-inducible expression of GREB-1
(Fig. 3B, right). We performed ChIP assay to determine

GREB-1 enhancer (Supplementary Fig. S4). Insulin similarly
reduced ERα binding to XBP-1 enhancer 1 (Supplementary

T-bet–overexpressing cells are less sensitive to tamoxifen in the presence of insulin. To further evaluate the effects of T-bet–mediated changes in E 2 signaling, we
examined tamoxifen sensitivity of MCF-7p versus MCF-7T-bet cells. Both cell types showed similar sensitivity to
1 μmol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen in the absence of insulin
(Fig. 4A). Insulin increased the proliferation of MCF-7p
as well as MCF-7-T-bet cells; the magnitude of stimulation
was significantly higher with MCF-7-T-bet cells. Although
tamoxifen treatment reduced insulin-stimulated growth in

both cell types, the overall level of proliferation was significantly higher in MCF-7-T-bet cells compared with parental
cells (under insulin plus tamoxifen or a combination of insulin, tamoxifen, and E2). Similar results were obtained at
variable insulin and tamoxifen concentrations (Fig. 4B and
C). The concentrations of insulin used in these experiments are similar to the levels seen in breast cancer patients with hyperinsulinemia (36). Note that at 0.1 μmol/L
tamoxifen, MCF-7-T-bet cells showed modest yet significant resistance to tamoxifen compared with MCF-7p cells,

and this resistance was further enhanced in the presence
of insulin (Fig. 4C).
To examine the role of endogenous T-bet on cell proliferation, we treated MCF-7 and T47-D cells with siRNA against
T-bet. Due to low basal levels of T-bet and the failure of T-bet
siRNA–treated cells to proliferate, interpretable results could
not be obtained in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Even with
only a 30% reduction, T-bet siRNA–treated T47-D cells
showed reduced proliferation on insulin or E2 stimulation
(Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained with BT-474 cells
(data not shown).
Antiestrogen-resistant cells express higher levels of
T-bet. We used clonal variants of MCF-7 that had acquired
tamoxifen (MCF-7-T) or fulvestrant resistance (MCF-7-F;
ref. 29) to determine whether there is a correlation between
antiestrogen resistance and T-bet expression. Both MCF-7-T
and MCF-7-F cells expressed higher levels of T-bet (Fig. 5A).
FOXA1 expression was significantly reduced in these resistant cells compared with parental cells. Basal GATA-3 expression was unchanged in all three cell types. Insulin
reproducibly reduced GATA-3 expression in MCF-7 and
MCF-7-T cells. Reduced FOXA1 expression and T-bet overexpression in MCF-7-T and MCF-7-F cells correlated with
absence of E2-inducible GREB-1 expression (Fig. 5B). Thus,
T-bet overexpression and reduced expression of either
FOXA1 or GATA-3 are consistent features associated with
acquired (MCF-7 derivatives) or intrinsic (BT-474, ZR7530, and MD-361) antiestrogen resistance of breast cancer
cell lines.
We used siRNA against T-bet to determine whether the tamoxifen resistance of MCF-7-T cells can be partially reversed
by reducing the levels of T-bet (Fig. 5C). T-bet siRNA–treated
cells failed to grow and, as in T47-D cells, E2 treatment did
not result in cell proliferation. These results suggest that
T-bet is required for redirecting ERα to genes that may be
essential for E2-stimulated proliferation of cells.
T-bet–overexpressing cells display elevated EGF-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. A functional ERα transcriptional network has previously been
shown to suppress growth factor–activated signaling, and
this network is thought to be essential for ERα-positive
breast cancers to respond to antiestrogen treatment (37).
Conversely, elevated growth factor–dependent mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or AKT activation

is associated with antiestrogen resistance in breast cancers
(38–40). To determine whether T-bet–mediated disruption
of the ERα:FOXA1:GATA-3 transcriptional network leads to
altered growth factor–dependent MAPK and AKT activation, we examined the levels of pERK and pAKT in
MCF-7p and MCF-7-T-bet cells on treatment with EGF,
heregulin, or insulin. pERK levels were higher and prolonged in EGF-treated MCF-7-T-bet cells compared with
MCF-7p cells (Fig. 6A). Basal pAKT levels were consistently
higher in MCF-7-T-bet cells (1.44-fold, P = 0.006, n = 6)
compared with MCF-7p cells. Consequently, overall EGF
stimulated pAKT level was also elevated in MCF-7-T-bet
cells compared with MCF-7p cells. Similar to EGF, insulinstimulated ERK activation was prolonged in MCF-7-T-bet
cells compared with MCF-7p cells (Fig. 6B). Interestingly,
heregulin-mediated ERK and AKT activation, which relies
mostly on ERBB2:ERBB3 heterodimers, was similar in both
cell types (Fig. 6C). The effects of T-bet on EGF and insulinmediated ERK and AKT are independent of growth factor
receptor levels because the levels of EGFR, ERBB2/HER2,
and ERBB3 were similar in both cell types.

Discussion
The intrinsic subtype classification scheme and several
other studies have identified the ERα:FOXA1:GATA-3 transcription factor network in luminal type A breast cancers
as well as in ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines (3, 6, 35).
FOXA1 is a positive regulator of ERα binding to genome (14,
41). GATA-3, similar to FOXA1, binds to regions on chromatin that are enriched for ERα binding and may function as a
cofactor for ERα binding (15). In contrast to FOXA1 and
GATA-3, the transcription factors Nkx3-1 and LEF-1 inhibit
ERα binding to genome (42). In this study, we have identified
T-bet as an additional transcription factor that can disrupt
the activity of ERα. T-bet significantly inhibited the ability
of ERα to bind chromatinized DNA despite having a modest
effect on ERα protein levels. T-bet may inhibit ERα binding
by reducing the levels of GATA-3. T-bet additionally may inhibit GATA-3 DNA binding through protein-protein interaction as in T cells (20).
The major effects of T-bet and insulin on ERα-, FOXA1-,
and GATA-3–positive cells are on E2-dependent proliferation,

Figure 3. T-bet inhibits chromatin binding of ERα- and E2-regulated gene expression. A, T-bet overexpression results in general reduction in GATA-3,

Methods. *, P = 0.0001, MCF-7p versus MCF-7-T-bet cells under identical treatment conditions. B, effect of different concentrations of insulin on the

response to tamoxifen, and growth factor receptor activation. In both MCF-7-T and T47-D cells, even a modest reduction (30%) of T-bet levels caused a marked decrease in
E2-dependent proliferation. These results are somewhat incompatible with the results of ERα binding studies, which
showed T-bet–mediated reduction in ERα binding to XBP1 and GREB-1. We noted that T-bet overexpression did not
significantly affect ERα binding to another E2-regulated
gene, SMRT (Supplementary Fig. S4). This suggests that the
effects of T-bet on ERα DNA binding are gene specific. It is
possible that T-bet redirects ERα to proliferation-associated
genes. In this context, studies in mammary and prostate epithelial cells suggest a key role for GATA-3 and FOXA1 in the
expression of differentiation-associated genes (11, 12, 43).

Therefore, ERα:FOXA1:GATA-3 may be involved in the expression of two independent gene expression pathways,
one involved in differentiation and the other in proliferation.
T-bet may abrogate the differentiation-associated gene expression program while maintaining or enhancing the proliferation-associated gene expression program.
T-bet, ERα, FOXA1, and GATA-3 are rate-limiting celllineage–specific transcription factors compared with housekeeping transcription factors such as SP-1; therefore, a subtle
change in their expression and/or activity levels is sufficient
to have a biological effect. In this context, an insulin-dependent increase in T-bet expression (2-fold) correlated with a
50% reduction in GATA-3 expression (Fig. 2C) and a 70% increase in proliferation rate (Fig. 4A). As a consequence,

tamoxifen plus insulin–treated MCF-7 cells maintained a
proliferation rate similar to untreated cells (Fig. 4A). Further
elevation of T-bet levels through overexpression augmented
insulin effects in terms of overall proliferation and response
to tamoxifen.
It is recently suggested that whereas resistance to antiestrogen aromatase inhibitors is due to ligand-independent activation of ERα, resistance to tamoxifen is due to activation
of growth factor signaling pathways (40, 44). Consistent with
this possibility, elevated activity of the growth factor signaling pathway molecules Raf and ERK is associated with ta-

moxifen resistance (38). These results raise the possibility
that E2 and tamoxifen actively repress growth factor signaling pathways through ERα in tamoxifen-sensitive cells, and
loss of this repressive mechanism leads to tamoxifen resistance. A recent study supports this possibility: E2:ERα and
tamoxifen:ERα repress ERBB2 expression through Pax2-dependent recruitment of ERα to the ERBB2 enhancer, and loss
of this association results in tamoxifen resistance (37). Although we did not observe an effect of T-bet on any growth
factor receptor expression, we did observe a prolonged EGF
and insulin-mediated induction of ERK and an increased

(P < 0.05). B, E2 fails to induce the

treated with siRNA as in Fig. 4D
and cell proliferation was measured
by BrdUrd-ELISA. As in T47-D cells,
T-bet siRNA reduced T-bet protein
levels by 30% (left) and transcript
levels by 50% (middle).

basal level of activated AKT. T-bet–mediated changes in ERα
activity could influence the expression of other positive or
negative regulators of growth factor signaling.
Insulin-mediated upregulation of T-bet accompanied
with repression of GATA-3 is the major finding of this
study. The loss of GATA-3 is an important step in the
transformation process because it marks the progression
from adenoma to early carcinoma followed by metastasis
in animal models of breast cancer (45). Hyperinsulinemia
is an independent risk factor for breast cancer, and the
presence of diabetes in breast cancer patients is linked to
a 40% increase in mortality within the first 5 years after
diagnosis (25, 46). Elevated fasting insulin and estrogen levels, but not IGF-I, are associated with increased risk of
breast cancer (47). A recent systematic review and metaanalysis revealed increased breast cancer risk among wom-

en with diabetes, and it is suggested that diabetes contributes to cancer progression and mortality (28). Consistent
with these observations, use of Metformin, a diabetic therapy, is associated with reduced cancer incidence, lower
cancer-related mortality, and higher response to neoadjuvant therapy (48, 49). Our in vitro studies show the effect
of elevated insulin on ERα-positive cells with respect to
growth, response to antiestrogen treatment, and growth
factor signaling. Further epidemiologic studies focusing on
outcomes of antiestrogen therapy in ERα-positive patients
with or without diabetes are needed.
