Abstract
B-cell receptor signaling contributes to apoptosis resistance in
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), limiting the efficacy of
current therapeutic approaches. In this study, we investigated
the expression of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a key
component of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, in CLL
and its role in apoptosis. Gene expression profiling identified
enhanced expression of SYK and downstream pathways in CLL
compared with healthy B cells. Immunoblotting showed
increased expression and phosphorylation of SYK, PLC;2,
signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, and
extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 in CLL compared
with healthy B cells, suggesting enhanced activation of these
mediators in CLL. SYK inhibitors reduced phosphorylation of
SYK downstream targets and induced apoptosis in primary
CLL cells. With respect to prognostic factors, SYK inhibitors
exerted stronger cytotoxic effects in unmutated and ZAP70+
cases. Cytotoxic effects of SYK inhibitors also associated with
SYK protein expression, potentially predicting response to
therapy. Combination of fludarabine with SYK Inhibitor II or
R406 increased cytotoxicity compared with fludarabine
therapy alone. We observed no stroma-contact–mediated
drug resistance for SYK inhibitors as described for fludarabine
treatment. CD40 ligation further enhanced efficacy of SYK
inhibition. Our data provide mechanistic insight into the
recently observed therapeutic effects of the SYK inhibitor R406
in CLL. Combination of SYK inhibitors with fludarabine might
be a novel treatment option particularly for CLL patients with
poor prognosis and should be further evaluated in clinical
trials. [Cancer Res 2009;69(13):5424–32]

Introduction
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most prevalent
B-cell malignancy in adults, is characterized by expansion of
monoclonal mature B lymphocytes with low levels of surface
membrane immunoglobulin. Despite advances in treatment, the
disease remains incurable, warranting further efforts to identify
novel molecular targets in CLL.

Signals propagated through the B-cell receptor (BCR) guide the
maturation and survival of B cells and may promote progression of
CLL. Structural and functional features of the BCR associate with
the clinical course, indicating that antigen stimulation and
signaling may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this
disease (1, 2). Leukemic cells of patients with an aggressive clinical
course typically display BCRs encoded by unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgVH) genes and express the protein
tyrosine kinase ZAP70. In contrast, CLL cells from most patients
with stable disease express mutated IgVH and lack ZAP70 (3–5).
The two subsets also differ in their ability to transmit BCR-derived
signals, as in vitro ligation of IgM induces stronger signaling
responses and prolongs cell survival in CLL cells from patients
with a poor prognosis (6–9). Moreover, biased VH segment usage
and stereotyped complementarity determining region 3 substantiate the theory of BCR involvement in the pathogenesis of CLL
(10, 11), suggesting the BCR signaling pathway as new target for
therapy in CLL.
The protein tyrosine kinase spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)
represents a key mediator of proximal BCR signaling, providing
proliferation and survival signals in a variety of hematopoietic cells
(12). After antigen stimulation, SYK is recruited to the BCR and
becomes activated by sequential phosphorylation at conserved
tyrosine residues. Once activated, SYK propagates the BCR signal
by associating with adaptor proteins and phosphorylating important signaling intermediates, such as VAV, Phospholipase Cg2
(PLCg2), Bruton’s tyrosin kinase, and B-cell linker protein. The
signaling cascade then proceeds with the activation of further
downstream signaling molecules including extracellular signal
regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), and p38 (13). Translocations
involving SYK have recently been identified in myelodysplastic
syndromes and T-cell lymphoma, indicating that SYK may also
function as a proto-oncogene (14, 15). Protein tyrosine kinase
inhibitors such as Curcumin or Piceatannol exert proapoptotic
effects in some B-cell lymphoma entities (16, 17). Recently, more
specific SYK kinase inhibitors, such as SYK Inhibitor I to IV or R406
have been developed. The oral SYK inhibitor R406 has been safely
tested in humans for nonmalignant diseases (18).
Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that SYK may be
a rational candidate for targeted therapy of CLL and that SYK
inhibitors might eliminate the constitutive BCR signal and,
therefore selectively promote cytotoxicity of CLL cells.

criteria (20), and history of treatment were analyzed. All patients were
untreated or off therapy for at least 6 mo before inclusion. B cells were
isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and negative selection (B-cell
isolation kit II; Miltenyi Biotech).
Microarray and pathway analysis. Microarray and pathway analysis
were performed by reanalysis of the baseline raw gene expression data from
Vallat and colleagues (21) using Genedatas Expressionist (Genedata AG).
These include 12 previously untreated patients and 6 healthy donors. After
condensation with Wu’s GC-RMA algorithm (22), differentially expressed
genes were determined for pathways from the KEGG database6 using
Student’s t test.7
Reagents and cell lines. Curcumin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich,
Piceatannol, SYK Inhibitor II (SYKII), and IV from Calbiochem. R406 was
provided to H. Jumaa, Freiburg, Germany by Rigel Pharmaceuticals. All
inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, also used as negative control in the
respective concentration. Arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-ara-A) was from
Sigma-Aldrich, SYK antibody from Santa Cruz. Antibodies against
phosphorylated and total ERK1/2, STAT3, PLCg2, Akt, and secondary
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibodies were from Cell Signaling.
The B-CLL–derived cell line MEC-1 and stromal cell line M2-10B4 were
from DSMZ cell collection and American Type Culture Collection,
respectively, and cultured in RPMI or Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium,
supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin,
2 mmol/L L-glutamine.
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis. One microgram of total RNA
isolated from CLL cells and healthy B cells (Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit) was
transcribed into first strand cDNA (Qiagen Omniscript RT kit), after
quantification and quality control via the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. Realtime PCR was carried out in duplicates using FastStart SYBR green Master
Mix and the LightCycler 480 system (Roche). SYK primers were from
SuperArray, h-glucoronidase primers were self-designed. Ct values were
determined by the second derivative maximum method (23) and relative
quantification was performed using the DCt method: DCt = Ct(SYK)Ct(hGlu) (24).
Immunoblot analysis. Total cell protein extracted from B cells of
patients with CLL and healthy donors were analyzed for the expression of
the indicated proteins by immunoblotting as previously described (25).
Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was performed using the ImageJ
software.
Immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts (5 Ag)
of protein lysates were incubated with antibodies overnight. After
centrifugation and at least three washing steps, the precipitated protein
was resuspended in loading buffer and stored at 20jC. Samples were
heated to 95jC for 2 min, centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by
immunoblotting.
Apoptosis assay. Cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10%
FCS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L
6
L-glutamine at a concentration of 1 to 5  10 cells/mL in 96-well plates
in the presence or absence of varying doses of the SYK inhibitors at 37jC
for 48 h. For CD40 activation, cells were treated with 100 ng/mL sCD154
(Biosource). For coculture experiments, M2-10B4 cells were cultured for
24 h before CLL cells were added. For apoptosis analysis, cells were
stained using Guava Viacount (Guava Technologies) or stained with the
Annexin-V Apoptosis Detection kit I (BD Biosciences) and assayed by
flow cytometry. Results were analyzed with FlowJo and GraphPad Prism
software.
Intracellular staining of active Caspase 3 and p-Akt. For active
Caspase 3, cells were cultured for 24 h with SYKII, R406, or vehicle control.
For p-Akt detection, cells were cultured 72 h after siRNA transfection. Cells
were stained for CD19, fixed, and permeabelized (Foxp3 staining kit;
eBioscience), stained intracellularly with active Caspase 3 antibody (BD

Bioscience) or p-Akt, subsequently with FITC-labeled anti-rabbit F(ab’)2
fragment (Jackson Immunoresearch), and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Protein tyrosine kinase activity assay. Tyrosine kinase activity assay
(Sigma Aldrich) was performed in duplicates using human recombinant SYK
and ZAP70 (R&D Systems). For SYK, a final concentration of 0.77 ng/mL
per well was used and, for ZAP70, due to lower enzymatic activity, 1.1 ng/mL.
To determine inhibitory capacity, untreated tyrosine kinase activity was
defined as 1.
Transfection with SYK siRNA. CLL cells (7  106) were resuspended in
Nucleofector solution (Nucleofector kit V; Amaxa), containing 1 Amol/L
control siRNA or SYK siRNA (Dharmacon), and transfected using the Amaxa
Nucleofector program U-013. After 24 h, cells were centrifuged, resuspended
in 400-AL culture medium, and plated in a round-bottomed 96-well plate.
Viability and SYK expression was determined 72 h after transfection by flow
cytometry using a PE-labeled anti-SYK antibody (Santa Cruz) or Annexin-V/
PI staining. SYK expression was calculated by DMFI = MFI (SYK)
MFI
(unstained).

Results
Gene expression profiling identifies enhanced expression of
SYK and its pathway in CLL cells versus healthy B cells. The
BCR signaling pathway was highly overexpressed in CLL compared
with healthy B cells as assessed by gene expression profiling (21).
SYK, a central mediator of BCR signaling, was significantly
overexpressed in three of four Affymetrix probe sets in CLL
patients compared with healthy donors. Because mutated and
unmutated CLL differs in BCR signaling, we compared the
expression of SYK in mutated and unmutated CLL. Unmutated
cases showed a trend for higher SYK mRNA expression compared
with mutated CLL samples. In line with SYK overexpression, CLL
cells showed enhanced expression of SYK downstream signaling
molecules within the BCR signaling pathway including VAV, RAC,
PLCg2, RAS, AKT, and ERK1/2 (Fig. 1A).
Enhanced quantitative gene expression and protein expression of SYK in CLL cells. Real-time PCR using cDNA of 19 CLL
patients (14 mutated, 5 unmutated) and 17 healthy donors confirmed
the enhanced SYKexpression in CLL cells observed by gene expression
profiling (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, a trend for higher SYK expression in
the unmutated CLL samples was detected (data not shown).
SYK protein expression normalized to h actin was f2-fold
higher in CLL samples compared with healthy B-cell samples as
assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). The CLL-derived cell line
MEC-1 also expressed high SYK levels (Fig. 1C, right). CLL cells
from unmutated patients revealed a significantly higher SYK
protein expression than those from mutated cases (Fig. 1D),
confirming the trend observed at mRNA level.
Enhanced phosphorylation of SYK and its downstream
targets in CLL cells compared with healthy B cells. Because
expression of SYK does not provide information about its activity,
we analyzed the phosphorylation status of SYK in CLL cells
compared with healthy B cells. Direct detection of phosphorylated
SYK in whole cell lysates is hampered by the lack of suitable
antibodies. We therefore performed phospho-tyrosine immunoprecipitation followed by total SYK immunoblotting. In parallel,
we performed a total SYK immunoblot with equal protein
amounts as used for immunoprecipitation. To rule out that any
effects observed on phospho-SYK resulted from differential
expression of total SYK, densitometric ratios were generated
between phosphorylated and total SYK. In addition to the higher
overall SYK expression levels (Fig. 1C), the phosphorylation of
SYK in CLL was f2-fold higher than in normal B cells (Fig. 2A).
Finally, phosphorylation of PLCg2, and signal transducers and

activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), typical downstream
intermediates of SYK, was significantly increased and p-ERK1/2
tended to be increased in CLL cells compared with healthy B cells
(Fig. 2B).

SYK inhibitors reduce phosphorylation of SYK downstream
mediators in CLL cells. To test whether activation of these
downstream targets is SYK dependent, we analyzed their
phosphorylation pattern in the presence and absence of SYK

Figure 1. SYK and downstream pathway molecules are differentially expressed in CLL cells compared with healthy B cells. A, top, reanalysis of gene expression
profiling data revealed four affymetrix probe sets corresponding to the SYK gene with increased expression in CLL cells (n = 12) compared with healthy B cells (n = 6),

inhibitors. All inhibitors significantly reduced phosphorylation of
PLCg2, STAT3, and ERK1/2 in MEC-1 cells (Fig. 2C). Similar effects
were observed in primary CLL cells (low expression levels
prevented analogous analysis of p-PLCg2; Fig. 2D). MEC-1 cells
were analyzed after overnight treatment. Due to the common high
rate of apoptosis in extended culture of primary CLL cells,
phosphorylation was analyzed after 2 hours of SYK inhibitor
treatment (4 Amol/L).
SYK inhibitors induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells.
Because increased SYK kinase activity might promote survival of
CLL cells, we tested the effect of SYK inhibitors on the viability of
CLL cells. Quantification of viable and necrotic cells by Guava
Viacount revealed significant cytotoxicity for Curcumin, Piceatannol, SYKII, and SYK Inhibitor IV in primary CLL cells. SYKII showed

the highest cytotoxic effect on primary CLL cells, whereas the effect
on the viability of healthy B cells was minor (Fig. 3A). SYKII
achieved a significant decrease in viability at a concentration of as
low as 1 Amol/L (Fig. 3B). Reduction of viability by SYK inhibition
predominantly resulted from increased apoptosis rather than cell
necrosis both in CLL and healthy B cells as assessed by flow cytometric quantification of Annexin-V and 7-AAD staining (Fig. 3C).
This might explain the overall low effects observed in Fig. 3A (note
that Guava Viacount analysis is unable to detect apoptotic/
Annexin-V+/7-AAD cells). Because the concentration of 4 Amol/L
has been described to be achievable in vivo for R406 (26), and SYKII
and R406 share equal IC50 values regarding SYK inhibition in vitro
(41 nmol/L), we continued with a concentration of 4 Amol/L.
Intracellular staining for active Caspase 3 suggested that induction

of apoptosis was Caspase 3 dependent (Fig. 3D). Interestingly,
SYKII-induced Caspase activation was more effective in unmutated
CLL samples than mutated ones (Fig. 3D, right). Finally, we treated
CLL cells from 38 CLL patients with SYKII (4 and 10 Amol/L) or
R406 (4 Amol/L) for 48 h. SYK inhibitors reduced the relative
viability of CLL cells to 76% and 44% for SYKII (4 and 10 Amol/L)
and 66% for R406 (4 Amol/L), respectively, as assessed by AnnexinV/7AAD staining (Fig. 4A).
SYK inhibitor–induced apoptosis correlates with prognostic
factors and SYK protein expression. Given the differences in
clinical course, the differential SYK expression pattern (Fig. 1D),
and Caspase 3 activation (Fig. 3D) depending on mutational status,
we separately analyzed the susceptibility of CLL cells of these
patient subgroups to SYK inhibition. CLL cells from unmutated
patients showed a significantly higher rate of SYK inhibitor–
induced apoptosis corresponding to decreased viability compared
with cells of mutated patients. Similar results were obtained when

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

cells were stratified by ZAP70 expression status. These data suggest
that particularly patients with a poor prognosis might benefit from
SYK inhibition (Fig. 4B). In addition, SYK protein expression
correlated with cytotoxic effects of SYK inhibition (Fig. 4C). These
data show that high SYK expression correlates with better response
to SYK inhibitor treatment, indicating that SYK expression might
predict for SYK inhibitor responsiveness.
Specificity of SYK inhibition with respect to induction of
apoptosis. Because ZAP70 and SYK belong to the same protein
family and share a high homology, we performed a protein tyrosine
kinase activity assay demonstrating that both inhibitors only
decreased the kinase activity of SYK but not ZAP70 at the
concentrations used (Fig. 5A). Still, SYK inhibitors might act via
unspecific binding of other kinases. To verify that SYK regulates
apoptosis in CLL, we performed SYK gene silencing experiments in
CLL cells. Seventy-two hours after transfection, we observed a
significant induction of apoptosis along with down-regulation of

SYK-Dependent BCR Signaling in B-CLL

SYK protein expression in SYK siRNA-transfected compared with
control siRNA-treated CLL cells as assessed by flow cytometry
(Fig. 5B). In line with our previous findings, we observed a concomitant induction of Caspase 3 (Fig. 5C). Finally, in three of three
analyzed samples, a reduction of Akt phosphorylation was
observed, another SYK downstream signaling molecule (Fig. 5D).
SYK inhibitors increase the efficacy of fludarabine. The
combination of fludarabine, the most potent cytoreductive agent in
CLL, with other drugs enhances its antileukemic effects (27).
Therefore, we assessed the in vitro effects of SYK inhibitors in
combination with the active fludarabine derivate F-ara-A. Cotreatment of F-ara-A with SYKII or R406 significantly decreased viability
of CLL cells at low, in vivo achievable doses of R406 (Fig. 6A). The
mean viability of F-ara-A–treated cells was reduced from 47% to
34% by SYKII and to 30% by R406, respectively.
Stromal cell coculture does not influence the effect of SYK
inhibitors on CLL cells, but CD40L stimulation sensitizes CLL
cells toward SYK inhibition. Because the microenvironment
enhances the viability of CLL cells and thereby decreases their
sensitivity toward chemotherapy (28), we assayed apoptosis rates
of CLL cells incubated with SYKII in the presence and absence of

the stromal cell line M2-10B4. Stromal coculture protected CLL
cells against spontaneous apoptosis (data not shown). However,
the presence of stromal cells did not limit SYK inhibitor-induced
cytotoxicity of CLL cells (Fig. 6B).
In proliferative centers, CD40L-expressing T cells represent an
important feature of the CLL microenvironment (29). Therefore, we
analyzed the effect of SYKII in combination with CD40 ligation.
Stimulation with CD40L (100 ng/mL) significantly increased SYKIImediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 6C), suggesting that SYK inhibitors
might ensure potential targeting of both, CD40 stimulated,
proliferating and resting CLL cells.

Discussion
The signal transducer SYK is a crucial factor for function and
survival of B cells. In the absence of SYK, B-cell maturation is
blocked at the early pro–B-cell state in murine knockout models
(30). Furthermore, inducible depletion of Iga, the linker between
the BCR and its signaling cascade, results in rapid death of mature
B cells in mice, revealing the importance of BCR signaling for B-cell
survival independent of antigen contact (31). Moreover, SYK

respectively. Cytotoxicity is defined as difference of

However, we observed a nearly 2-fold higher expression along with
an f2-fold higher phosphorylation status of SYK in CLL compared
with healthy B cells, suggesting that SYK inhibition, although not
fully CLL specific, may be feasible in CLL. In fact, the prodrug of
R406, R788 (Fostamatinib disodium, FosD), an orally available SYK
inhibitor under development for rheumatoid arthritis, showed
significant in vitro activity against BCR-dependent non–Hodgkin
lymphomas (26) and, very recently, even high clinical activity in
patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. CLL/SLL patients showed
an overall response rate of 54%, whereas other B-cell malignancies
included in the study such as DLBCL (21% overall response rate),
follicular lymphoma (10%), and mantle cell lymphoma (11%)
showed considerably lower response rates (36), lending direct
in vivo evidence to the concept of SYK inhibition in CLL.
Our data may contribute to the understanding of these effects.
We observed a decrease of CLL cell viability along with an increase

formally acts as a proto-oncogene and is suggested to be involved
in tumorgenesis of diverse hematologic malignancies including
mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL),
lymphoblastic leukemia, and follicular lymphoma (26, 32–34). Here,
we hypothesized that SYK plays a crucial role in CLL by
transmitting BCR-mediated signals to the dependent downstream
signal transduction pathways.
In contrast to a previous report claiming normal SYK expression
in CLL compared with normal B cells (35), but lacking quantitative
analysis, we show SYK overexpression in CLL compared with
healthy B cells. SYK protein expression was enhanced in
unmutated compared with mutated CLL, potentially reflecting
the increased BCR signaling in unmutated CLL reported by others
(6–9). In accordance with its role for tonic BCR signaling, active
SYK is crucial for DLBCL cell survival (26). In line with these data,
all tested SYK inhibitors resulted in apoptosis induction and
reduction of phosphorylation of downstream targets in CLL in this
study. SYK inhibitor treatment also affected normal B cells.

SYK-Dependent BCR Signaling in B-CLL

of Caspase 3 activation in CLL cells upon treatment with SYKII or
R406. Importantly, these events correlated with prognostic factors
suggesting that SYK targeting may be most effective in patients
with worst prognosis. Recently, a similar correlation was reported
for the treatment of CLL cells with the SRC and ABL kinase
inhibitor Dasatinib (37). Other studies showed elevated levels of
SYK in cases with high ZAP70 expression, arguing for a synergistic
role of ZAP70 and SYK in initial BCR signaling (38).
The enhanced sensitivity of ZAP70+ CLL samples and the
homology of SYK and ZAP70 raise the possibility that SYK
inhibitors also interact with ZAP70 kinase activity. Such crossinhibition is, however, highly unlikely because SYK but not ZAP70
activity was significantly reduced by both SYK inhibitors in a
protein tyrosine kinase activity assay. However, the inhibitors
tested may interfere with other molecules. In non–Hodgkin
lymphoma cell lines, SYK but not Janus-activated kinase has been
found to be the relevant target to inhibit proliferation and survival
by comparing effects of specific SYK inhibitors and a bispecific
SYK- and JAK-inhibitor (39). Expression of the constitutively active
TEL-SYK in BaF3 cells induced Akt and ERK phosphorylation, an
effect abrogated by R406 treatment (40). Finally, our gene silencing
experiments provide direct evidence for SYK-dependent regulation
of apoptosis in CLL cells. Taken together, although off target effects
cannot be completely excluded, our data indicate that SYK
inhibition is the most likely mechanism underlying apoptosis
induction in CLL cells by SYKII and R406.
Fludarabine represents an efficient therapy for CLL but still
bears disadvantages in terms of frequent relapses and development
of fludarabine resistance (41). Fludarabine-based combination
therapies offer superior therapeutic efficacy (42). With respect to
molecularly targeted fludarabine combinations, the tyrosine kinase
inhibitor genisteine increased induction of apoptosis in CLL
compared with fludarabine alone (43). Because fludarabine
treatment results in dephosphorylation of STAT1 (44), whereas
SYK inhibition leads to STAT3 dephosphorylation (Fig. 2D), we
hypothesized that SYK inhibition might represent a rational
combination partner for fludarabine. Activated STAT1 and STAT3
can dimerize and modulate the expression of target genes related
to prosurvival or antiapoptotic effects (45). Moreover, unmutated
patients with early requirement for therapeutic intervention carry a

substantially higher risk for the development of fludarabine
resistance (46). Because these prognostically poor cases have
higher sensitivity to SYK inhibitors, the combination of SYK
inhibitors and fludarabine may have the potential to prevent
development of resistance. We indeed observed that the simultaneous exposure to fludarabine and SYK inhibitor II or R406 resulted
in synergistic apoptotic effects on primary CLL cells.
Interactions between CLL cells and the microenvironment
exhibit prolonged cell survival, growth advantage, and drug
resistance to malignant CLL cells. For fludarabine, reduced
cytotoxicity on CLL cells in stromal coculture is described (28).
Here, we observed no protective effect by stromal cell contact that
would limit the efficacy of SYK inhibition in CLL cells. The absent
protective effect for SYK inhibitors might be due to involvement of
SYK in the cross-talk between stroma and CLL cells, as SYK was
recently described to be involved in integrin signaling (47). CD40Lexpressing CD4+ T cells provide important proliferation stimuli in
proliferative centers in CLL (29) and may rescue CLL cells from
apoptosis (48). In contrast to fludarabine (49, 50), CD40 ligation
sensitized CLL cells toward SYKII, potentially suggesting that
combined treatment might efficiently target both, proliferating and
resting CLL cells.
In summary, this work supports the concept of SYK inhibition as
therapeutic strategy in CLL. Our data provide mechanistic
understanding of the therapeutic effects of SYK inhibition recently
observed in CLL, and warrant further clinical assessment.
