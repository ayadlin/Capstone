Abstract:
To improve prognosis in recurrent glioblastoma we developed a treatment
protocol based on a combination of drugs not traditionally thought of as cytotoxic
chemotherapy agents but that have a robust history of being well-tolerated and are
already marketed and used for other non-cancer indications. Focus was on adding
drugs which met these criteria: a) were pharmacologically well characterized, b) had
low likelihood of adding to patient side effect burden, c) had evidence for interfering
with a recognized, well-characterized growth promoting element of glioblastoma, and
d) were coordinated, as an ensemble had reasonable likelihood of concerted activity
against key biological features of glioblastoma growth. We found nine drugs meeting
these criteria and propose adding them to continuous low dose temozolomide, a
currently accepted treatment for relapsed glioblastoma, in patients with recurrent
disease after primary treatment with the Stupp Protocol. The nine adjuvant drug
regimen, Coordinated Undermining of Survival Paths, CUSP9, then are aprepitant,
artesunate, auranofin, captopril, copper gluconate, disulfiram, ketoconazole,
nelfinavir, sertraline, to be added to continuous low dose temozolomide. We discuss
each drug in turn and the specific rationale for use- how each drug is expected to
retard glioblastoma growth and undermine glioblastoma’s compensatory mechanisms
engaged during temozolomide treatment. The risks of pharmacological interactions
and why we believe this drug mix will increase both quality of life and overall survival
are reviewed.

Preamble: ecce turtur. ipse proficit tantum con
collum foras.

current recurrent glioblastoma treatments by adding nine
already-marketed growth factor-inhibiting drugs to low
dose continuous temozolomide.
We review here the rationale for this nine drug mix
using already-marketed drugs, as adjuvants to improve
effectiveness and tolerability of low dose continuous
temozolomide in treatment of glioblastoma at first postStupp protocol recurrence. The total ten drugs of CUSP9
are in three function categories:
i] Established use in recurrent glioblastomatemozolomide,
ii] Sound pre-clinical evidence supporting potential
benefit based on documented inhibition of growth factors
or a pathogenic driver- aprepitant, artesunate, auranofin,
disulfiram with copper gluconate, nelfinavir,
iii] Published reports of increased OS with use
but of uncertain significance and drugs with less robust
theoretical support- captopril, sertraline, ketoconazole
As many growth enhancing systems have been
identified in glioblastoma, and many currently-marketed
drugs not traditionally thought of as cytotoxic have
shown to have inhibitory activity at one or another of
these systems, we searched the literature to find such
drug- glioblastoma growth factor matches that would be
unlikely to add to patient side effect burden based on our
experience of long use of the respective drug in humans
for non-cancer indications. Drugs were selected also on
the basis of having little potential for seriously aversive
effect or interaction with each other and, as an ensemble,
had reasonable likelihood of concerted and coordinated
activity against key biological features of glioblastoma
growth. In the Conclusion section, we outline why CUSP9

I. INTRODUCTION
In the effort to improve the current prognosis
in glioblastoma of one or two years’ survival after
primary diagnosis even with the best of treatments, we
have created a new adjuvant approach, termed CUSP9,
presented here. As of early 2013, standard initial treatment
consists of temozolomide and irradiation after maximal
primary resection, typically referred to as the “Stupp
Protocol” [1, 2]. There is no standard or agreed upon
single best approach to recurrent glioblastoma after this
initial treatment. A total of 22 clinical trials reported
in 2012, all using various new, recurrent glioblastoma
treatments that all had sound established activity in preclinical study [1, 3 - 23]. Yet none reported more than
minimal quality of life (QOL) or overall survival (OS)
benefit. Many were stopped early for increased morbidity,
drastically decreased QOL, or for meeting pre-established
futility criteria.
Dörner et al. recently reported that even after
placement of carmustine (BCNU) wafers along the
surgical cavity wall, the recurrence pattern remains largely
local with meager meaningful advantages to patients in
OS or QOL increases [24]. We present here a position
paper from The International Initiative for Accelerated
Improvement of Glioblastoma Care on a treatment plan
aiming for more lasting tumor control while not adding to
patients’ side effect burdens. Our treatment plan- termed
CUSP9- aims to increase QOL and OS compared to

can be expected to improve QOL as well versus current
simpler treatments.
Pharmacologic risks of each drug individually
and permutations of all possible combinations were
carefully evaluated and presented in section IV. CUSP9
PHARMACOLOGY. The only potential for harmful
interaction that we can foresee is the potential interaction
between artesunate and auranofin. We believe this risk
can be managed by slow up titration of doses and frequent
monitoring as described in section V. Partial CUSP’s,
Risk Reduction, Risk Assessment. Otherwise the risks
of these drugs used together was assessed to be low with
the understanding that unexpected interactions may occur
and this risk will require exceptional vigilance, as with
any new treatment but particularly so in a regimen of this
complexity.
There is now broad recognition that multiple crosscovering growth promoting signaling paths and cell death
avoiding mechanisms are active in glioblastoma [25- 30].
As Siegelin et al. stated in referring to glioblastoma,
“Drug discovery for complex and heterogeneous tumors
now aims at dismantling global networks of disease
maintenance” [29]. Or as formulated by Eyler et al. also
referring to glioblastoma, these “networks of disease
maintenance” require commensurate corresponding efforts
directed to understanding “the exact nature by which many
of the pathogenic drivers connect” [30]. On this basis we
generate CUSP9. The conclusion of recognition of many
global networks and multiple pathogenic drivers is the
requirement for many pathogenic drivers’ inhibitors as
CUSP9 provides.
Multiple pathogenic drivers and interconnected
growth promoting paths of glioblastoma maintenance

are concepts reminiscent of a well-known problem in
medicine, expressed as a metaphor- “The Three Locks
Problem”. A door with three locks will not open any better
if one or two of the locks are unlocked. Likewise blocking
one or two growth factors may not result in any slowing of
glioblastoma growth due to alternate paths that take over
for the blocked one[s]. How do we proceed if glioblastoma
has twenty locks on it? In logic terms “if A then not B”
does not imply “if not A then B” [if growth path “A”
remains active then glioblastoma won’t be stopped (“not
B”) does not imply that if growth path “A” is effectively
inhibited then glioblastoma will be stopped (“B”)].
Table 1. lists the drugs of CUSP9 with basic area of
projected modes of action.

II. RATIONALE:
II.1. Established use in recurrent glioblastomatemozolomide
Temozolomide is a 194 Da alkylating cytotoxic
cancer chemotherapy drug. Current standard primary
glioblastoma treatment, the Stupp Protocol, is, with minor
variations, temozolomide and irradiation to tumor area
after maximal resection that spares areas vital to good
QOL [1, 2, 31, 32]. There is no generally accepted standard
treatment for glioblastoma that has recurred after Stupp
Protocol treatment. Our plan is to give temozolomide
50 mg/m2 daily without pause (or until toxicity) at first
recurrence after a completed Stupp Protocol. Multiple
other first recurrence treatments have been reported but
none have exceeded the QOL maintenance and a median
OS of 30 to 41 weeks that this regimen provides [2, 33,
34].

II.2. Sound pre-clinical evidence supporting
potential benefit based on documented growth
factor or a pathogenic driver’s inhibitionaprepitant, artesunate, auranofin, disulfiram,
nelfinavir.
II.2.1. aprepitant.
Aprepitant is a 534 Da oral neurokinin-1 receptor
(NK-1R) antagonist approved for use in treating
chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), an
indication for which it is quite safe and effective [35, 36],
even during highly emetogenic regimes [36-40]. Substance
P is an eleven amino acid signaling neuropeptide that
belongs to the tachykinin family of peptides. Substance P
is the natural ligand of NK-1R that by binding to NK-1R,
in addition to generating CINV, forms a regulatory link in
many biological functions in cancer such as proliferation,
angiogenesis, migration, and metastasis.

Figure 1: Schema showing relationship between CCR5
and neurokinin receptor (NK-1R) signaling operative
in glioblastoma. Note three points: (a) NK-1R signaling can

augment CCR5 signaling by converting less active plain CCR5
to the more active serine phosphorylated CCR5, (b) NK-1R and
CCR5 can cross-cover for each other, both independently can
activating ERK1 ⁄ 2 and (c) expected synergy between aprepitant
and maraviroc in blocking this aspect of glioblastoma growth
promotion. Maraviroc is a newly approved blocking drug at the
CCR5 cytokine receptor.

consumption is massive.
As part of a screening campaign of the National
Cancer Institute, USA, artesunate and other related
artemisinin-type compounds were shown to have
cytotoxicity towards 60 cell lines derived from 8 different
tumor types, including CNS tumors [52]. That artesunate
induces apoptosis in cancer cells was first shown by
Efferth et al. in a leukemia cell line [53].
That there was no correlation between IC50
values of artesunate and mRNA expression of the
multidrug resistance-conferring ABCB1 gene (coding
for P-glycoprotein efflux pump) in the National Cancer
Institute cancer cell lines and that artesunate is similarly
active towards cell lines which over-expressing MDR1/
P-glycoprotein [54-56] indicate that artesunate isn’t a
substrate for these chemotherapy defeating elements.
Likewise, methotrexate-resistant cells with an amplified
dihydrofolate reductase gene and hydroxyurea-resistant
cells over-expressing ribonucleotide reductase were not
cross-resistant to artesunate [56].
Particularly beneficial for glioblastoma treatment,
the transfer of dihydroartemisinin, the first metabolite of
artesunate, from plasma to lipid-rich brain structures is
still increasing at a time when post-dose blood levels of
both artesunate and dihydroartemisinin are decreasing in
humans with malaria treated with artesunate [57].
A rough correlation of baseline antioxidant mRNA
gene expression in the National Cancer Institute cancer
cell lines with the IC50 values for artesunate indicated a
role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress in artesunate’s
anti-cancer effect [58-60]. WEHI7.2 cells selected for

Muñoz et al. [41, 42] have been documenting in a
series of articles the growth enhancing aspects of NK1R signaling in several cancers over the last few years.
They have been advocating trials of aprepitant in an anticancer role in these cancers. Since many cancers [43, 44],
including glioblastoma [45] use Substance P signaling
at NK-1R as a growth stimulating element it was logical
enough to suggest aprepitant as treatment adjunct [46, 47].
An added benefit of aprepitant is the rarity of any side
effect at all when used as treatment for CINV [37].
Empirically, Substance P stimulates glioma cells’
proliferation [45]. NK-1R antagonists such as aprepitant,
after binding to NK-1R, inhibit proliferation, have proapoptotic effects, and exert anti-angiogenic and antimigration effects in pre-clinical models [42, 44, 48].
Aprepitant has central effects and good diffusion
across the blood brain barrier (BBB). Moreover, it is
eminently well tolerated [36, 37] even in a clinical trial
as antidepressant using 300 mg/day. Side effects did not
differentiate from placebo [49].
Considering the above data sets, plus the fact
that glioma cells tend to overexpress NK-1R [50] and
aprepitant shows a broad spectrum antitumor action,
including in glioma models, it was natural to add
aprepitant to CUSP9.
II.2.2. artesunate.
Artesunate is a 384 Da orally available drug used
in tablets alone or in fixed combinations with other
drugs to treat malaria, particularly with drug-resistant
Plasmodia strains, around the world and usually without
a prescription [51]. Artesunate is one of several related
semi-synthetic phytoderrived drugs, the artemisinin’s,

resistance to hydrogen peroxide or transfected with
thioredoxin (note strong thioredoxin reductase inhibition
by another member of CUSP9, auranofin discussed below,
see also Figs. 2. and 6.), manganese superoxide dismutase
(that is inhibited by another CUSP9 member, disulfiram
discussed below) or catalase were relatively artesunateresistant compared to parental cells [58].
As tumor cells commonly contain more iron
than corresponding normal cells, the question arises as
to whether iron may be critical for artemisinin group
medicines’ action towards tumor cells. Cellular iron
uptake and internalization are mediated in part by binding
of transferrin-iron complexes to a transferrin receptor
(CD71) on the cell surface membrane [61].
CD71 is highly expressed in tumors, including
glioblastoma [62, 63]. CD71 expression was higher
in a leukemia cell line and in U373 glioma tumor cells
(48-95%) than in peripheral mononuclear blood cells of
healthy donors (<2%) [64]. Iron and transferrin increased
cytotoxicity of artesunate and artemisinin towards these
cell lines [64].
Interestingly, exposure of artemisinin and its
derivatives produced only marginal cytotoxicity to
non-tumor cells [64, 65]. The growth of primary
human fibroblasts was almost unaffected by artesunate
concentrations up to 100 µM [64, 65]. The elegance of
this approach of Efferth et al. is that it uses glioblastoma’s
hunger for growth as reflected in CD71 overexpression,
an erstwhile growth enhancing attribute, to help kill these
cells.
Artesunate also induces DNA breakage in a
dose-dependent manner as shown by single-cell gel

electrophoresis and confocal microscopy of the DNA
double-strand break indicator gamma-H2AX [53, 66].
This is probably the proximate mode of damage leading
to artesunate mediated cell death.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also
known as HER-1) is an important target for cancer therapy
and is particularly important specifically in glioblastoma
pathophysiology [67-69]. Artesunate strongly enhanced
erlotinib cytotoxicity to glioblastoma cells [70].
Artesunate enhanced cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in human
acute T cell leukemia Jurkat cell line J16 and the human
acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines CEM and Molt4 [71]. Exposure of glioma cells to artesunate enhanced
irradiation induced induction of apoptosis, G2/M arrest
and DNA damage [72] and had similar effects in a nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line [73].
II.2.3. auranofin.
Auranofin is a 678 Da drug approved to treat
rheumatoid arthritis [74, 75]. Three sets of data suggest its
use in adjuvant treatment of glioblastoma.
One of the probable mechanisms of action of
auranofin in promoting cytotoxic drug cell death is given in
Fig. 2. Anti-TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis protein (ATIA)
is highly expressed in human glioblastoma [76]. ATIA
knockdown in glioblastoma cells renders them sensitive
to hypoxia-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 2, ATIA
up regulates thioredoxin reductase [76], a cytoprotective
factor reducing intracellular ROS. As outlined below, it
is precisely by inhibiting such cytoprotective thioredoxin
reductase that we think auranofin exerts its primary
anticancer effect. Strong thioredoxin reductase inhibition

by auranofin is well-documented [77]. Mean circulating
blood thioredoxin reductase levels were 31% higher in
glioblaastoma patients compared to matched controls
[78], indicating a significant pathophysiological role
for thioredoxin reductase. Glioblastoma tissue levels of
thioredoxin reductase were five times that of normal brain
[78].
Shifting cancer cells’ redox bias towards oxidizing,
away from reducing is an active area of cancer research.
As a major force in limiting oxidizing conditions within
cells, thioredoxin reductase therefore becomes an
attractive target in cancer treatment generally. Auranofin
and other thioredoxin reductase inhibitors are in active
research programs as adjunct to current cancer treatment
[79, 80]. How thioredoxin reductase inhibition by
auranofin shifts intracellular redox towards an oxidizing
state is diagrammed in Fig. 6. Increased intracellular ROS
generated by auranofin has been shown empirically [81,
82].
Multiple experimental thioredoxin reductase
inhibitors other than auranofin are in various stages of
development for cancer treatment after showing good
pre-clinical activity [83, 84]. We intend to use the one we
already have- auranofin.
As diagrammed in Fig. 6, NADP(H) is required for
regeneration of reduced thioredoxin. Reduced thioredoxin
is a major intracellular reducing agent. Glioma cell line
proliferation remains unchanged as intracellular NADP(H)
levels decrease until a level ~15% of normal is reached.
At further decreases beyond that point proliferation and
motility become progressively impaired and viability
steeply declines as levels descend through <10% of
normal [85].
We have empirical evidence of auranofin’s
cytotoxicity in multiple cancer models [86], for example
ovarian cancer [87], head & neck cancer [88] and others.
Cathepsin B is an important element of glioblastoma

cell invasion along Scherer’s tracts [89, 90]. Two
independent groups found that heavier cathepsin
B immunohistochemical staining predicts shorter
glioblastoma OS [91, 92]. Experimental reduction
of cathepsin B inhibited glioblastoma growth and
invasion in rodent glioblastoma models [93]. Auranofin
inhibits cathepsin B and was previously suggested as a
glioblastoma treatment adjunct on that basis [94].
II.2.4. disulfiram.
Of all the ancillary drugs of CUSP9, disulfiram has
the strongest evidence of potential benefit in glioblastoma.
Disulfiram is a 297 Da oral aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) inhibitor that results in accretion of acetaldehyde
if ethanol is ingested. Such high levels of acetaldehyde
are experienced as extremely unpleasant, hence alcohol
consumption is discouraged, the current main clinical
use of disulfiram. It has been in continuous use in the
treatment of alcoholism since the 1940’s [95].
After ingestion disulfiram is rapidly metabolized to
diethyldithiocarbamate after binding copper in the stomach
[96]. Disulfiram metabolism is complex [96] and the
ultimate metabolic species relevant to ALDH inhibition
or disulfiram’s anti-cancer effects remain uncertain. In
clinical use by far the most common observation is to see
no side effects at all in those patients taking disulfiram
250 mg p.o. once or twice a day to treat alcoholism. An
estimated 10% will experience an easily tolerated metallic
taste at times.
Much of the seminal work on disulfiram’s anticancer cell properties come from the lab of Weiguang
Wang at the University of Wolverhampton [97-101].
Disulfiram’s multiple anticancer properties have
been demonstrated in pre-clinical models of breast,
prostate, myeloma, leukemia, lung cancers, cervical
adenocarcinoma, melanoma, neuroblastoma and colorectal
cancer [102-112].

multiple contexts [112-118]. Particularly the stem cell
sub-population of glioblastoma are ALDH positive [97,
98, 120-123], and susceptible to inhibition by disulfiram
[97, 98, 100, 120-124]. We have increasing pre-clinical
evidence that disulfiram, an old and inexpensive drug in
continuous use for 6 decades in alcohol aversion therapy
exerts significant anticancer activity [104, 112-118].
Disulfiram has previously been documented to
potentiate the effect of several chemotherapy agents
in vitro: cisplatin [128], gemcitabine [101, 129]
temozolomide [130], paclitaxel [100], docetaxel [131],
cyclophosphamide [132], 5-fluorouracil [101, 102],
doxorubicin [99], sunitinib [104], and BCNU [133].
Currently, disulfiram is in Phase I clinical trials in
metastatic melanoma, in hormone refractory cancers
with lung and liver metastases (www. clinicaltrials.gov,
identifiers NCT00256230 and NCT00742911) as well as
in prostate cancer (identifier: NCT01118741).
Dufour et al. randomized 64 women with
non-metastatic high risk breast cancer in a double
blind placebo controlled phase 3 clinical trial of
adjuvant diethyldithiocarbamate vs. placebo [134].
Diethyldithiocarbamate 10 mg/kg p.o. or placebo
was given once weekly for 9 months after the first
chemotherapy cycle. After 6 years, overall survival
was 81% in the diethyldithiocarbamate group vs. 55%
in placebo group, a significant difference. Current
recommended dosing of disulfiram during alcoholism
treatment is 250-500 mg per day, equivalent to 3500 mg

of diethyldithiocarbamate weekly compared to the ~700
mg of diethyldithiocarbamate weekly given in the Dufour
et al. trial [134]. Even at 3000 mg p.o. per day disulfiram
gave no serious adverse effects (135).
A detail-poor case report appeared in 1977 of a
woman experiencing gradual remission of breast cancer
metastases to spine, skull, pelvis and ribs after intermittent
exposure to disulfiram and interspersed drinking bouts
(136). She died from a fall after ten years of such
intermittent, alternating (and overlapping?) alcoholdisulfiram exposure. Autopsy showed high blood alcohol
level and microscopic nests of metastatic breast cancer in
her bone marrow but no macroscopic disease [136].
A case report of a patient with metastatic ocular
melanoma treated with disulfiram 250 mg/day p.o. and
zinc gluconate 250mg/day p.o. showed decreasing tumor
volume [110]. After 53 months of ongoing treatment with
disulfiram (250 mg/d) and zinc gluconate (250 mg/d) this
patient experienced no progression with no discernible
drug side effects [110].
Suppression of breast cancer xenografts by
disulfiram was shown in mice (137). Multiple in vitro
models have recently demonstrated considerable antiglioblastoma effects via proteasome and ALDH inhibitions
[97, 98, 111, 115, 122, 130, 138]. Suppression of breast
cancer xenografts by 74% was shown in mice [137]. In
prostate cancer xenografts 40% reduction in growth was
seen [112, 117] indicating that combinatorial approaches
will be needed [112, 118]. Following this conclusion

Ketola et al. found several compounds could potentiate
disulfiram in reducing prostate cancer xenograft viability
[104]. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
receptor kinase inhibitor sunitinib for example was
synergistic with disulfiram [104].
Disulfiram also inactivates P-glycoprotein [139],
a major drug exporter from the brain, and therefore a
problem for us in delivering chemotherapeutic drugs to
glioblastoma.
Antitumor efficacy specifically of temozolomide
can be directly increased by disulfiram partially through
inhibition of the DNA repair protein O6-methylguanineDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) [130, 140]. MGMT
is expressed at low levels in human brain. It normally
functions to remove methyl groups from methylguanine
that if left uncorrected would be read as adenosine (the
normal G:C becomes an A:T) [141, 142]. MGMT transfers
the temozolomide-generated methyl groups bound to O6position of guanine directly to an active site cysteine
(Cys145) in MGMT in a 1:1 stoichiometric reaction [143],
permanently destroying the MGMT molecule that is then
degraded after each single methylguanine demethylation
[144]. Consistent with this, OS patients with MGMTproficient tumors is somewhat shorter than those with
lower expression of MGMT [145, 146].
Lesions that escape MGMT-mediated removal
are targeted by mismatch repair (MMR). During
DNA replication temozolomide-induced unrepaired

methylguanine mispairs with thymine. MMR
removes thymine from these methylG-T mispairs.
As methylguanine is left unrepaired by MMR the
methylguanine is again read as an adenosine and paired
with thymidine. This becomes a futile repair cycle. This
may result in single-strand DNA repair patches that block
replication. In a subsequent round of replication, this
eventually results in double-strand breaks that are potent
activators of the apoptotic pathway [141, 142].
Inhibition of MGMT by O6-benzylguanine during
temozolomide is undergoing clinical trials but frequent
bone marrow toxicity is discouraging [147]. Due to its
basic microenvironment MGMT’s Cys145 has a low
pKa of 4.8 [148]. Srivenugopal and his colleagues have
found that disulfiram can form adducts with this Cys
145 at the active site of MGMT, thereby inactivating
its methyltransferase function [144, 149]. Empirically
disulfiram increases the cytotoxicity of another aklylating
agent occasionaly used in glioblastoma treatment,
BCNU (Paranjpe). From the foregoing, it is clear that
the electrophilic drug disulfiram, a major component in
the CUSP9 protocol, is expected to have multifaceted
biochemical effects, all working in synergy to improve
glioma treatment.
As highly reactive compounds, disulfiram and
its first metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate react with
many proteins in the cell, particularly by binding metals
in enzymes’ active sites [113-120]. This has made the

Figure 5: Schema indicating how HSP90, and hence its inhibition by nelfinavir (NFV) sit at several crossroads
previously documented as crucial for glioblastoma growth. Note that CUSP9 is expected to inhibit the compensatory survival-

enhancing response to temozolomide by two paths. A) as indicated in this Figure via nelfinavir dampening of AKT function, and B] by the
NFkB degradative actions of disulfiram. Maintainance of a good NFkB pool is one of the crucial elements in glioblastoma hardiness [314].

determination of a primary mechanism of action in cancer
treatment of disulfiram and its multiple metabolites
difficult. Several non-exclusive mechanisms have
been proposed based on demonstrated in vitro actions
summarized below:
•	 inhibition of DNA methyltransferase [112],
•	 reduction of NF-kB activation [100-102, 111,
116, 133, 150],
•	 reduction of DNA replication [118],
•	 induction of oxidative stress [100, 117],
•	 induction of mitochondrial membrane
permeabilization, cell cycle arrest, reduction
of angiogenesis, invasion of cancer stem cells
[100],
•	 proteosome inhibition [115-118, 137, 151],
as inhibitor of superoxide dismutase with
consequently increased intracellular reactive
oxygen species [152],
•	 MGMT repair function inhibition [133, 144,
149]
•	 inhibition of interleukin-1 converting enzyme
(ICE-1) as diagramed in Fig. 4 [153, 154].
•	 ALDH inhibition mediated decreases cancer
stem cell function [121, 122, 126, 127, 130,
155]
•	 P-glycoprotein inactivation [139]
Which of these paths is important in disulfiram’s
clinical anti-cancer effect, which are primary and which
secondary to some underlying primary effect, which are

simple epiphenomena, are all unanswered questions.
Recent dramatic data from the lab of H. Ishii in Osaka
indicate that ALDH enzymatic function itself is important
for stem cell resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy [155].
ALDH therefore is not just a marker for stemness. It is a
mediator of stemness and most importantly, a mediator we
can block.
Concordant with the data of H. Ishii’s group and
particularly encouraging for our intended use in CUSP9,
Schäfer et al. have recently identified ALDH 1A1 isoform
as a major marker (and mediator of) glioblastoma
resistance to temozolomide [123]. We have ample reason
to include disulfiram. In many ways disulfiram would
seem to be the ideal adjuvant addition to current cytotoxic
chemotherapies of cancer, including glioblastoma.
Since some data on disulfiram as adjunct during
cancer treatment has indicated a requirement for copper
[97- 99, 101, 105, 116, 119, 122]. Copper gluconate is a
434 Da salt, widely available without prescription as a
dietary supplement that we add to CUSP9 on that basis.
This might not be necessary in that it is thought that
plain disulfiram rapidly chelates copper after ingestion
[96]. The United States’ FDA has concluded that copper
(cupric) gluconate is a category 1, Generally Regarded as
Safe (GRAS) substance. In their words category 1 means
that “There is no evidence in the available information
on (substance) that demonstrates, or suggests reasonable
grounds to suspect, a hazard to the public when they are
used at levels that are now current or might reasonably be
expected in the future.” [156].
II.2.5. nelfinavir.
Nelfinavir is a 568 Da oral aspartic protease
inhibitor in use for over ten years in the treatment of HIV.
It is usually well tolerated, short term side effects are few.
If gradual up titration is observed, loose stool without
need for treatment was the only immediate side effect of
note. In HIV-infected persons, years of treatment with HIV
protease inhibitors may lead to metabolic disturbances,
lipodystrophy, and insulin resistance [157].
HSP90 is a dimeric ATP-binding chaperone protein
that binds to and thereby conformationally stabilizes
many signaling receptors and crucial intracellular proteins
[158]. Many signaling receptors shown to be important in
glioblastoma growth are such HSP90 stabilized proteins
or protein complexes. Some of these are diagramed in
Fig. 5. There are many other client proteins of HSP90 that
are of potential importantance in glioblastoma growth.
Nelfinavir, like the older, related, 721 Da protease inhibitor
ritonavir, binds to and prevents or limits the chaperone
function of HSP90 [159-161] with multiple beneficial
cancer chemotherapy consequences, some of which are
outlined below.
Wide interest in nelfinavir as an effective new anticancer drug [162-165], in particular in the adjuvant role in
combination treatment, isreflected by the implementation

of more than two dozen clinical studies with cancer
patients as of the end of 2012 (www.clinicaltrials.
gov) that are currently ongoing, including two studies
with glioma patients (NCT00915694: nelfinavir plus
temozolomide plus radiation; NCT01020292: nelfinavir
plus temozolomide).
Increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [163,
167] and HSP90 function interference [161] are major
paths by which nelfinavir is thought to exert an anti-cancer
effect. Loci of nelfinavir’s undermining of several core
survival enhancing paths engaged by temozolomide can
be seen diagrammed in Fig. 5.
Nelfinavir-mediated ER stress, probably caused by
nelfinavir’s inhibition of a yet unidentified ER associated
aspartic proteinase involved in protein processing, leads to
a massive accumulation of misfolded proteins within the
ER lumen, triggering the pro-apoptotic pathway of the ER
stress signaling cascade [163, 167, 168]. In glioma cells,
nelfinavir-mediated ER stress was shown to up regulate
pro-apoptotic proteins and to induce cleavage of caspase
4 in vitro and in a xenograft model [168].
Nelfinavir has not only been shown to be effective
against a wide variety of different cancer cell lines at
clinically relevant levels [169-171], but more importantly
has also been shown to be similarly effective on ex vivo
biopsy tissue from patients with primary and recurrent
ovarian cancer [163]. This indicates a possible use of
nelfinavir for relapsed cancer, independent of previously
acquired chemoresistance. Particularly in myeloma cells
can impaired proliferation and proteosome inhibition be
seen after exposure to nelfinavir, with curiously enhanced
inhibition to that provided by the marketed proteosome
inhibitor bortezomib [171].
Experimental (not marketed) inhibitors other than
nelfinavir or ritonavir e.g., derivatives of geldanamycin
like 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), are in active research programs as adjuncts to
traditional current cancer cytotoxic chemotherapy. Trials
of these drugs are based on strong pre-clinical evidence
that HSP90 inhibition undermines several compensatory
survival enhancing responses to temozolomide in
glioblastoma [172], in other cancers [173] and in gliomas
to other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs [174-176].
Specific studies on temozolomide action in glioma
have shown HSP90 inhibition (again mostly but not
uniquely using 17-AAG) as a strong sensitizing maneuver
to glioma cells otherwise resistant to temozolomide [174,
177] or irradiation [178]. Several novel [not marketed]
HSP90 inhibitors have shown strong cytotoxicity against
glioblastoma specifically against the stem cell subpopulation [175, 176, 179, 180]. Empirical inhibition
is seen of proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines U251,
A172, and U373 during exposure to nelfinavir alone but
without significant apoptosis induction [181]. Increased
vulnerability in nelfinavir-exposed cells to apoptosis
induction by other agents was however demonstrated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[181].
Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (72 kDa, MMP-2, also
termed gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (94 kDa, also termed
gelatinase B) are proteolytic collagenases strongly
associated with glioblastoma growth and invasion [159,
182, 183]. MMP-9 secretion is an HSP90 requiring
event [184]. Note that three of CUSP9 drugs inhibit
MMP-2, MMP-9- captopril, disulfiram, and nelfinavir,
as referenced in the respective sections of this paper, and
have previously been suggested as a mutually reinforcing
trio of drugs well-suited as mutually reinforcing adjuvants
in the treatment of glioblastoma [159].
Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is a
phosphatase that constitutively inhibits or functions to
diminish AKT (protein kinase B, a serine/threonine kinase)
signaling. PTEN is often malfunctioning in glioblastoma,
resulting in AKT related constitutive overdrive. AKT is
one of the many intracellular proteins requiring HSP90
chaperoning for optimal functioning. Experimental HSP90
inhibitors like 17-AAG [177] as well as nelfinavir and
ritonavir inhibit AKT function [161, 185-190], partially
reversing faulty PTEN function as commonly seen in, and
forming one of the core growth enhancing abnormalities
of, glioblastoma [191-193]. In 2006 Pore et al. showed
decreased VEGF, hypoxia induced factor-1 (HIF-1),
and AKT activation in U87 glioma cells and decreased
angiogenesis into U87 seeded, subcutaneously placed
Matrigel plugs in mice treated with oral nelfinavir [194,
195].
We therefore expect some of the growth drive
consequent to PTEN loss common in glioblastoma [193]
resulting overactivation of AKT to be partially reversed
by nelfinavir.
Of the many proteins that use HSP90 for correct
folding and function, one of the most important in
glioblastoma pathophysiology is perhaps transforming
growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) [196-199]. That TGF-beta
sits at a crucial crossroads in glioblastoma’s dysregulation
as recently reviewed by Eyler and Rich makes HSP90 a
particularly attractive target [30]. This crossroads position
of HSP90 in this regard is also indicated in Fig. 5.
Benefit was clear when nelfinavir was added to
standard chemoradiation in a recent study of unresectable
non-small cell lung cancer [200]. Of particular note was
that this benefit was achieved using the dose we suggest
for CUSP9, 1250 mg p.o. twice daily, and that this gave
little evidence of added side effect burden to patients
[200].
A remarkable research of Xie et al. showed that
“nelfinavir is able to inhibit multiple members of the
protein kinase-like superfamily” in addition to lowering
AKT activation. Perhaps most interesting of all was their
observation and their accompanying conceptual leap, that
weak inhibition of multiple growth enhancing kinases as
provided by nelfinavir can result in significant anti-cancer
activity, not necessarily by itself but by setting up the
511

intracellular milieu to be less robust in coping with other
insults like irradiation or traditional cytotoxic drugs [190],
or in our case nelfinavir undermining survival paths that
are engaged after exposure to temozolomide.
We expect nelfinavir to be well tolerated. In HIV
studies only about 4% of nelfinavir treated patients
switched to other drugs due to side effects [201] and in
a recently reported clinical study of nelfinavir as cancer
treatment adjuvant nelfinavir added little morbidity [200].
For treatment of HIV-infected persons, nelfinavir is
more and more being replaced by ritonavir-boosted HIV
protease inhibitors of the newer generation. Some of these
HIV protease inhibitors, including lopinavir, atazanavir
[168], and even ritonavir as a single agent [185,189,
202], have been shown to have similar anti-tumoral
(but this does not imply identical) effects as nelfinavir.
Since nelfinavir is the currently most investigated HIV
drug for cancer treatment, this treatment plan will focus
on the incorporation of nelfinavir but remains open
for the inclusion or replacement by other HIV protease
inhibitors in case that preclinical or clinical data indicate
a superiority of other marketed HIV protease inhibitors in
glioblastoma treatment.

antidepressant such as sertraline compared to those not on
such...”Two-year survival in the cohort of patients taking
an SSRI was 32% versus 17% in those who were not (P =
0.18).” [ 209]. No excess toxicity was noted in the SSRI
treated patients [ 209].
Additive anti-proliferative effect in U87
glioblastoma cells was seen with temozolomide plus
sertraline in vitro [210]. Down regulation of AKT with
some reduced proliferation was seen in melanoma cells
exposed to sertraline [211] but it was undetermined if this
was related to serotonin reuptake inhibition or some other
attribute of sertraline. So all above considerations taken
together we consider the minimal risks of adding sertraline
to be worth any gains that might accrue, were this data,
particularly of slight increases in OS, to hold.
II.3.2. captopril
Angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)
are a class of eminently well-tolerated drugs commonly
used to treat hypertension, or congestive heart failure [212,
213]. ACEI inhibit the proteolytic cleavage of angiotensin
I to angiotensin II. A related class of drugs, sartans, binds
to and prevents the stimulation of the angiotensin II
receptor.
In a study of 87 glioblastoma patients, those on
ACEI or a sartan had lower need for dexamethasone [214].
This steroid-sparing use of ACEI alone holds potential to
improve QOL, in that psychiatric [215, 216], metabolic
[217], and immunosuppressive [218] morbidities
secondary to dexamethasone use in glioblastoma are not
trivial. The Carpentier et al. study’s finding of a nonsignificant increase in OS in the ACE inhibited group was
intriguing [ACEI use had “no effect on survival (16.2 vs.
17.9 months for the treated and the non-treated group,
respectively, P = 0.77)”] [214]. Data like this not meeting
statistical significance, as with the non-significant increase
in OS noted in Caudil et al.’s study of SSRIs, can both a)
be a real, important, and ultimately statistically significant
difference that becomes evident on further study with
larger populations, and b) allow important insights into
pathophysiology of a given disease if the difference
proves to be statistically significant even if not clinically
meaningful to patients in itself.
Captopril is a 217 Da oral ACEI, the first such to
enter clinical use [219]. Since then many other ACEI’s
have been approved yet captopril remains useful in treating
hypertension and as remodeling inhibitor post-myocardial
infarction [219]. Although hypotension is a theoretical
risk, captopril has a history of safe use in uncomplicated
hypertension. Orthostatic hypotension incidence remains
low even in setting of captopril use in congestive failure
and post-myocardial infarction [220].
In experimental systems, the antitumor effects of
diverse ACE inhibitors and sartans show that as a class
they inhibit cell proliferation and possess antiangiogenic,
antimetastatic effects in multiple cancer models;

II.3. Published reports of increased OS with use
but of uncertain significance and drugs with less
robust theoretical support- captopril, sertraline,
ketoconazole
II.3.1. sertraline
Sertraline is a 306 Da selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor (SSRI) in common use over the last twenty years
in the treatment of depressed mood [203]. It is usually
well-tolerated and is effective in about half of patients
started on it [203, 204].
By formal study of glioblastoma patients, an
18% rate of moderate to severe depression is seen postresection [205] but other studies would suggest that the
actual rate of depression-related signs and symptoms was
considerably higher and that these significantly degraded
quality of life in glioblastoma patients [206]. Family
member interviews indicate that glioblastoma patients
experience greater depression signs than the patients
themselves report [207].
A recent study of 1,364 glioma patients showed a
non-significant longer survival [“suggestive trend towards
a beneficial association”] in those treated post-diagnosis
with tricyclic antidepressants [208]. Not only don’t we
know if this data is a real effect or not (potential for
propter hoc fallacy) but also we don’t know that, if it were
a real association (longer survival if treated with a tricyclic
antidepressant) would this carry over to the modern SSRI’s
generally or sertraline specifically. However Caudill
et al. at the Mayo Clinic reported also a non-significant
longer survival in glioblastoma patients on an SSRI class

this basis as well we feel the ACEI effect of Carpentier et
al. will prove to be validated as a slight but statistically
significant benefit when greater numbers are studied.

Losartan, a sartan class pharmaceutical angiotensin
II receptor blocker, reduced the growth of C6 glioma in rats
[234]. Glioma cell line T98G constitutively synthesizes
MMP-2 and MMP-9. This is inhibited by captopril with
an expected consequent inhibition of Matrigel invasion
inhibition [235]. As human glioblastoma tissue produces
prodigious amounts of both MMP-2 and MMP-9,
collagenases strongly associated with glioblastoma growth
and invasion [159, 182, 183] captopril was previously
mentioned as an obvious therapeutic intervention for
glioblastoma [159].

Arachidonate
5-lipoxygenase
(arachidonate:oxygen
5-oxidoreductase,
EC
1.13.11.34) is the rate-limiting enzyme in leukotriene
synthesis. A proliferation enhancing role in glioblastoma
for 5-lipoxygenase generated leukotrienes was first
suggested in 1998 when inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase
was shown to inhibit proliferation in U-373 glioma
cell line [255]. dl-nordihydroguaiaretic acid (“Nordy”)
is a phytoderived 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor active in
inhibiting CD133+ related clonogenicity of glioma
cell lines [256]. Glioblastoma biopsy material studied
by immunohistochemistry for 5-lipoxygenase shows
heavy staining [257]. Two experimental 5-lipoxygenase
inhibitors inhibited proliferation of the A172 glioma cell
line [257], results confirmed and extended a year later
by a different group [258]. A heavy granular staining
for 5-lipoxygenase is seen in glioblastoma [and grade
3 astrocytomas] not seen in the even staining of normal
neurons and glia [259].
Much of the peritumoral edema seen during
glioblastoma is generated by 5-lipoxygenase mediated
leukotriene synthesis [260- 262]. Human glioblastomas
are prodigious producers of leukotrienes [263] the
consequence from which derives many of the decrements
in QOL and increases in tumor growth vigor. Glioblastoma
patients’ urinary leukotriene excretion decreases by 79%
post-resection [263] indicating that it was the tumor itself
that was generating excess leukotrienes. Exposure to
experimental 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors inhibited in vitro
glioma cell growth [264, 265]. Increased 5-lipoxygenase in
glioblastoma was first noted in 2003 [266], then confirmed
in a 2006 immunohistochemistry study showing staining
for 5-lipoxygenase where heavier staining correlated with
shorter OS [267]. The immunochemistry study of Ishii
in 2009 again confirmed this and furthermore showed
that experimental 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors inhibit
proliferation of A172 glioblastoma cell line [257].
Already in 1989 increased leukotrienes in areas of
glioblastoma peritumoral edema were documented [262].
On this basis we can expect diminished peritumoral
edema with consequently increased QOL in ketoconazole
treated glioblastoma patients as well as, if the data of Ishii
et al. and the other indices of anti-glioblastoma effects
mentioned hold, longer OS.

II.3.3. ketoconazole.
Ketoconazole is a 531 Da broad spectrum antifungal drug, used in both topical and oral applications
[236]. Several paths of importance in glioblastoma growth
have good experimental documentation of inhibition by
ketoconazole. To what extent ketoconazole congeners like
miconazole or fluconazole share the discussed properties
of ketoconazole is likewise unknown. Fluconazole
penetration into brain tissue approaches 1:1 with blood
levels but it might not possess the four attributes of
ketoconazole outlined below.
Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of a) 5lipoxygenase [237- 239], b) thromboxane synthase [240243], c) a drug efflux pump at the blood-brain barrier
[244- 250], and d) has shown an empirical inhibition of
cancer cell growth [238, 239].
In a study of long-term ketoconazole treatment of
onychomycosis, 18% of people developed slight liver
transaminase elevation, 3% developed transaminase
elevations high enough to trigger stopping ketoconazole
[251]. Reviews on the risks/benefits of ketoconazole
and related anti-fungal drugs have concluded risks for
ketoconazole use are low [252]. A total of about ten case
studies have been published of fatal hepatitis during oral
ketoconazole treatment [253].
In advanced prostate cancer patients on docetaxel
given adjunctive ketoconazole at 200 mg p.o. three times
daily this was well-tolerated, giving 1.24 microg/mL
trough and 2.79 microg/mL peak plasma ketoconazole
levels during steady-state [254].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

b) Ketoconazole & thromboxane synthase:
Robust thromboxane A2 content of, and synthetic
ability by, human glioblastomas was shown as early
as 1987 [268]. Thromboxane A2 receptors are widely
expressed on normal tissues and on various cancers,
including human glioblastoma cells [269- 271].
Thromboxane synthase catalyzes the formation of
thromboxane A2 from prostaglandin H2.
Already in 1998, unregulated gene expression
with corresponding increase in mRNA for thromboxane
513

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 502-530

synthase was noted in glioblastoma cells selected in
vitro for enhanced migration [272]. An experimental
thromboxane synthase inhibitor [(furegrelate) inhibited
glioblastoma cell line growth in vitro and growing in
nude mice and most importantly sensitized these cells
to he alikylating chemotherapy drug BCNU [273].
This confirmed and extended earlier work showing that
thromboxane synthase inhibition diminished in vitro
migration and sensitized glioblastoma cell lines to killing
by irradiation [274].
Following documentation of increased thromboxane
synthase gene and protein expression in the sub-set of
glioblastoma cells with a more migratory phenotype
compared to the slower moving majority population
[277] an in vitro study of exposure to the experimental
thromboxane synthase inhibitor furegrelate resulted in
caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic
death [275].
Thromboxane synthase as a growth facilitating
element also in many non-glioma cancers- and the
beneficial potential benefit from its inhibition- is an
active area of current research [276]. We intend to use the
thromboxane synthase inhibitor we already have on the
market- ketoconazole.

combined to the others as shown in the grid of Fig. 3. Each
pair of drugs was evaluated for the available evidence
of interactions using as source of information the Risk
Control Plans (RCP) of the reference medicinal product
[279], and by a specific research using MEDLINE and
Embase.

IV.2. Pharmacokinetic interactions:
The literature review has provided the evidence that
four potential pharmacokinetic interactions may occur for
the group of drugs scheduled in the protocol: ketoconazole
+ aprepitant, nelfinavir + aprepitant, artesunate +
ketoconazole and artesunate + nelfinavir.
IV.2.1. Ketoconazole + aprepitant and nelfinavir +
aprepitant
CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the
metabolism of aprepitant [280]. Ketoconazole is wellknown as one of the most potent inhibitors known of
CYP3A4. In vitro studies showed that ketoconazole may
inhibit the 98% of aprepitant metabolism, with a marked
increase in its bioavailability (5-fold increase of AUC,
3-fold increase of half-life) [280, 281]. Nelfinavir inhibits
CYP3A4 [282, 283]. No study has directly tested the
effect of nelfinavir on aprepitant levels or metabolism. It
is therefore difficult to quantify the pharmacokinetic result
of this potential interaction. In terms of clinical relevance,
if used in standard doses, the combination ketoconazolenelfinavir-aprepitant may result in very high levels of
aprepitant. In the previously mentioned antidepressant
article 300 mg. aprepitant per day (twice the dose
suggested for CUSP9) gave no side effects different from
placebo [36, 49].

c) Ketoconazole as efflux pump inhibitor:
Volume sensitive osmolyte efflux was blocked by
ketoconazole [244].
P-glycoprotein efflux of docetaxel at blood
brain barrier was inhibited by ketoconazole [245].
We have evidence for ketoconazole inhibiting BBB
efflux of phenobarbital [246] and ritonavir [160, 248].
Ketoconazole inhibits the human breast cancer resistance
protein (BCRP) [250], and P-glycoprotein efflux pump
[247- 249]. Its occasional use in psychiatric practice is
based on a) the salutary consequence of ketoconazole’s
blunting high cortisol excursions [277] and b) increase in
brain tissue of certain psychotropic medicines by virtue of
its efflux pump inhibition [278].

IV.2.2. Ketoconazole + artesunate and nelfinavir +
artesunate
As mentioned above, ketoconazole and nelfinavir
are both potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. CYP3A4 is also
involved in the metabolism of artesunate [284]. Nelfinavir
and ketoconazole can be expected to increase artesunate
levels. As a consequence, the possibility of artesunate
dose-related adverse reactions is enhanced, among which
the most relevant would be QT prolongation [285]. A QTc
of >o.42 will exclude artesunate from CUSP9.

IV. CUSP9 PHARMACOLOGY:
IV.1. Introduction.
The introduction of a therapy with ten-drugs
requires a special assessment of safety to limit the risk of
adverse drug reactions. The greater the number of drugs,
the closer should be the monitoring. We judge a minimum
of twice weekly un-hurried meetings with gradual oneby-one addition of drugs and slow up titration will be best
for safety. Drug-drug interactions represent a common
event and these should be prevented with an adequate
protocol of dosing that requires an early assessment of
potential interplays between the scheduled medicines.
To assess potential interactions each drug of CUSP9 was

IV.3. Pharmacodynamic interactions
The literature review did not provide direct evidence
of specific pharmacodynamic interaction among the drugs
included in the protocol. However, considering the main
categories of adverse drug reaction for each drug, a
potential hepatotoxic effect is expected for ketoconazole
[286], nelfinavir [287] and temozolomide [288]. Patients
exposed to the combination of these three drugs should

functions.
A further potential pharmacodynamic interaction
would be that between auranofin and artesunate. The
use of artesunate is contraindicated in patients receiving
aurothioglucose since both drugs have been associated
with the development of blood dyscrasias [289]. Although
a specific contraindication with auranofin is not reported,
we should expect risk for similar interaction with
auranofin + artesunate, warranting frequent blood counts
when these are given.

slow up titration. Unhurried careful weekly meetings are
required for CUSP9 to function safely. We will have better
chances to catch incipient unexpected interactions quickly
this way.
V.1.2. Addition of one drug at a time.
To minimize unforeseen drug-drug interactions with
a complicated but necessary regime like CUSP9, a single
drug only is added at each meeting. The next drug is added
only when it has been established that that latest added
drug has not generated a problem. The one exception to
this rule will be copper gluconate that will be given with
each disulfiram or not given if disulfiram is not tolerated.

IV.4. Felicitous drug-drug interactions:

V.1.3. Slow up titration.

IV.4. 1. Protection against artesunate cytotoxicity is
afforded by intracellular ROS reducing agents [58- 60],
important elements of which of which are inhibited by
auranofin [81,82] and disulfiram [100, 117, 152].
IV.4. 2. Auranofin does double duty. First as
thioredoxin reductase inhibitor [290, 291] then as
cathepsin B inhibitor [79, 80, 84, 94].
IV.4. 3. Note that three CUSP9 drugs inhibit MMP-2
& MMP-9- captopril, disulfiram, and nelfinavir [159, 292]
IV.4. 4.Two drugs of CUSP9 have inhibitory activity
at relevant drug efflux pumps, disulfiram [108, 109, 139],
and ketoconazole [245- 250].
IV.4. 5. Both disulfiram [98, 100, 121- 124] and
nelfinavir and other HSP90 inhibitors [294- 296] have
shown specificity in inhibiting cancer stem cell function.
IV.4. 6. Both artesunate [297] and nelfinavir [194,
195] lower both VEGF and HIF-1 activity.
IV.4. 7. Interference with AKT function has been
noted after exposure to sertraline [211] and nelfinavir [55,
65].
IV.4.8. Disulfiram and ritonavir acting together
inhibit ICE-1, lowering IL-1 beta growth drive to
glioblastomas [153, 154], also diagramed in Fig. 4.

Drugs will be added at the low end of their dose
range and slowly up titrated if meeting with the patient,
and lab study if needed, establish that the last dose has
been well tolerated.
V.1.4. Frequent lab monitoring.
Weekly check of EKG, liver, kidney, and bone
marrow function will be a minimum.
V.1.5.
Patients will have a 24 hour phone contact with
their monitoring physician and instructions to call if there
is any deterioration in any domain.
V.1.6. Exclusions.
A lengthy and detailed exclusion criteria list
will help safety. Among many other exclusions, herbal
preparations, nutritional supplements, or over-the-counter
medicines or other ancillary medicines will not be allowed
with 3 exceptions: 1) Hypertension controlled on any
combination of ACEI or sartans will be permitted, in
which case captopril is omitted from CUSP9, and 2) noninsulin requiring diabetes well controlled on metformin
will be allowed. The use of grapefruit juice or extracts will
be discouraged because of its CYP3A4 inhibiting effect. 3)
Hydromorphone will be allowed for pain control.

V.
Risk
Reduction,
Risk
Assessment, and partial CUSP’s.

V.1.7. Partial CUSP’s.
If an untoward reaction or side effect is seen with
the addition of a particular drug, that drug will be dropped
from that patient’s treatment protocol and the addition
process will continue as planned minus that drug, after
restitution to the state of well-being established prior to
addition of the offending drug. No further additions will
be given if such restitution does not occur.

V.1. Safety features built into CUSP9.
Underpinning the entire CUSP9 treatment process
and a crucial component of CUSP9 are the safety features
that must be in place for a new many-drug protocol like
this. Sudden onset drug-drug interactions can usually be
prevented by considering, as we have done, researching
literature and history of drugs under consideration and
their individual pharmacologic attributes. Specific safety
requirements of CUSP9 are therefore:

V.2. Our safety assessment.
Using our clinical experience with these drugs
combined with published data, to help others understand
the safety structure better we have stratified the relative
risk of the ten drugs as temozolomide >auranofin >

V.1.1 Frequent meetings.
Onset of drug-drug interactions is usually gradual.
Early recognition of a negative interaction is enhanced by

ketoconazole > nelfinavir >artesunate > sertraline >
captopril > disulfiram > aprepitant > copper gluconate.
For heuristic reasons and as options for patients
and physicians who are timorous we offer a suggestion
to consider partial CUSP’s in four risk category
combinations.

We are not the first (nor was Virchow when he
discussed this in mid-1800’s) to suggest a connection
between inflammation pathways and cancer, and to
consider blocking these as a cancer treatment modality
[301- 305]. The term “inflammation” is too imprecise
to be useful in discussing the relationship between the
malignant clone/cells and the rest of the body [301, 302].
CUSP9 aims to inhibit elements of inflammation that
enhance glioblastoma growth.
There are many open questions. To what degree do
nelfinavir and ritonavir share attributes? To what degree
does ketoconazole increase CSF levels of nelfinavir as
it does for ritonavir? Will BBB opening maneuvers be
required for any of the CUSP9 drugs? Will any of the
drugs work against any of the others in ways we don’t
foresee? To what extent are associations with angiotensin
inhibition and longer OS, or SSRI use and longer OS,
simple propter hoc fallacies or real meaningful or causal
elements?
Two of our CUSP9 drugs- disulfiram and ritonavir/
nelfinavir have a potential synergy in inhibiting a growth
path used in glioblastoma that resembles closely an IL1beta converting enzyme (ICE-1, also termed caspase-1)
and IL-18 mediated inflammation paths in some cases of
acute pancreatitis [153], diagramed in Fig. 4. “Reducing
IL-1beta and IL-18 production by inhibition of ICE-1
is one promising strategy...” [303] in cancer treatment
[294, 301- 303, 306] that was outlined already in 2001
by Randle’s group in München. IL-18 and IL-1beta are
both well documented growth facilitating elements in
glioblastoma [306, 307].We take up this thread by using
disulfiram and nelfinavir to do exactly that- ICE inhibition
with disulfiram and nelfinavir to inhibit IL-1 and IL18 activation, details of which are pharmacologically
explained in ref. 153 and depicted in Fig.4. We intend to
thereby re-re-wire the pathogenically re-wired, amplifying
feedback loop between HIF-1 and IL-1 common in cancers
generally as described by Kaluz and Van Meir [307].
Aspects of our approach are similar to that being
implimented in pediatric glioblastoma by J. Wolff et al.
[308] at Tufts University where relapse post-primary
treatment is selected in part by morphometric and
immunohistochemical data that show which markers
an individual tumor bears, then searching for alreadymarketed drugs that may block that receptor system or
marker. This can lead to use of non-cytotoxic drugs not
traditionally thought of as cancer chemotherapeutic drugsas in CUSP9.
As referenced throughout our paper, CUSP9 is
weighted towards interference with glioblastoma stem
cell function, a particularly fruitful sub-population to
target, offering higher reward yet having similar risks
as targeting the tumor cell population as a whole [309,
310]. Glioblastoma stem cells have a complex interaction
with their surrounding brain parenchyma, stroma and
extracellular matrix [311]. There is a bidirectional

V.2.1. Low risk combination:
Given at the low end of our target dosing range,
aprepitant 80 mg twice daily, sertraline 50 mg twice daily,
captopril 25 mg twice daily, disulfiram 250 mg twice daily,
copper gluconate 2 mg twice daily.
V.2.2. Medium risk combination:
artesunate or auranofin, nelfinavir, ketoconazole in
addition to the low risk drug combination.
V.2.3. Higher risk combination:
temozolomide, combination auranofin and
artesunate in addition to drugs of the low and medium
group, the full CUSP9 given at our suggested target doses:
1....artesunate 50 mg p.o. twice daily
2....aprepitant 80 mg p.o. twice daily
3....sertraline 50 mg p.o. twice daily
4....captopril 50 mg p.o. twice daily
5....auranofin 3 mg p.o. twice daily
6....nelfinavir 1250 mg p.o. twice daily
7….temozolomide 25 mg/M2 p.o. twice daily
8....disulfiram 250 mg p.o. twice daily
9....copper (cupric) gluconate 2 mg p.o. twice daily
10...ketoconazole 200 mg p.o. twice daily

VI. A CUSP9 SUMMARY:
The use of old drugs for new indications, coined
“repurposing” is a realistic concept to accelerate therapy
development for many cancers, previously formulated by
many others [for example 25, 113, 120, 299, 300]. We
herein add our voice and suggest a specific, coordinated
old drug mix- CUSP9- as a multipronged coordinated
attempt to augment current treatment of recurrent
glioblastoma. In parallel with bacteriology practice we
believe that a combination strategy such as CUSP9 is
less likely to allow development of chemotherapeutic
resistance as usually occurs in cancer treatment and
specifically limits clinical efficacy of temozolomide in
glioblastoma.
We, The International Initiative for Accelerated
Improvement  of Glioblastoma Care, heartily invite
suggestions, comments, or proposals for additions or
deletions, or further improvement of the CUSP9 protocol,
or its translational use in other cancer treatments. Indeed
allowing wide debate, critical thinking, and feedback
with intent to improve CUSP9 was a central motive
for publishing this protocol. Comments to either of the
corresponding authors will be sent to all co-authors for
discussion and evaluation.

relationship between these two compartements
(surrounding brain and the glioblastoma cell) [311, 312]
with which CUSP9 aims to block, as discussed throught
this paper.
Both that >99% of patients will experience
progression post-primary treatment and the short median
OS of patients with glioblastoma warrant taking the
measured and manageable risks of CUSP9. The 22 reports
of failed studies of new treatments using variations on
traditional cancer therapeutic published in 2012 [1, 3-23]
also justify our excursion into conceptually new treatment
approaches as here in CUSP9. CUSP9 complexity and
requirement for large clinician time commitment per
treated patient may be unavoidable if we are to make a
dent in this tough disease.
