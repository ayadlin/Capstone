BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and young people. Efficacy of
multiagent MAP (methotrexate, doxorubicin [Adriamycin], cisplatin) chemotherapy may be influenced by multiple
cellular pathways. This pilot study aimed to investigate the association of 36 candidate genetic polymorphisms in
MAP pathway genes with histological response, survival, and grade 3-4 chemotherapy toxicity in osteosarcoma.
METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 60 patients who had completed MAP chemotherapy. All patients were
manually genotyped for 5 polymorphisms. The remaining 31 polymorphisms were genotyped in 50 patients using the
Illumina 610-Quad microarray. Associations between candidate polymorphisms and histological response, progression-free survival, and toxicity were estimated using Pearson chi-square and Fisher exact tests, the Kaplan-Meier
method, the log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Poor histological response was
increased in variants of ABCC2 c.24C>T (P ¼ .011) and GSTP1 c.313A>G p.Ile105Val (P ¼ .009), whereas MTHFD1
c.1958G>A p.Arg653Gln was protective (P ¼ .03). Methotrexate toxicity was increased in variants of MTHFR
c.1298A>C p.Glu429Ala (P ¼ .038), ABCB1 c.3435T>C Ile145Ile (P ¼ .027), and ABCC2 c.3563T>A p.Val1188Glu (P ¼
.028). Variants of GSTP1 c.313A>G p.Ile105Val were at increased risk of myelosuppression (P ¼ .024) and cardiac damage (P ¼ .008). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study represents the most comprehensive study to date examining the role
of genetic polymorphisms in osteosarcoma. Although small and retrospective, it shows that several polymorphisms
appear to significantly influence toxicity and clinical outcome. These deserve prospective validation in the hope
of optimizing treatment for resistant disease and reducing the late effects burden. Cancer 2012;118:1856-67.

INTRODUCTION

Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and young people. Multiagent chemotherapy has dramatically improved survival from <20% after surgery alone to 55% to 70% at 5 years.1 Methotrexate, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cisplatin form the backbone of most standard treatment protocols as a triple-drug regimen
(MAP). However, approximately 40% patients show a poor response to chemotherapy, with inferior 5-year survival of
45% to 55%.2 Furthermore, 60% of bone tumor survivors experience severe or disabling chronic health conditions 30
years from diagnosis.3
Little is known about MAP chemotherapy pharmacogenomics, but information gained from the use of these agents
in other malignancies provides insight into potentially critical pathway components. All 3 drugs are substrates of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) membrane efflux transporters. Functional polymorphisms in several of these
proteins influence both chemotherapy toxicity and outcome in several malignancies but have not been investigated in
osteosarcoma.4-12

Genetic Polymorphisms in Osteosarcoma/Windsor et al

Methotrexate, transported by the reduced folate carrier (RFC) protein, disrupts the folate cycle by direct inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), consequently
depleting
methylene
tetrahydrofolate
reductase
(MTHFR) and thymidylate synthetase (TYMS). Adverse
survival in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) is associated with several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including MTHFR c.677C>T
p.Ala222Val, also known to enhance methotrexate toxicity
in both ALL and solid tumors.2,3,6,13-16 In osteosarcoma,
MTHFR c.677C>T p.Ala222Val increased hematological
toxicity but did not influence survival.17
Cisplatin and doxorubicin form helix-distorting
DNA adducts resulting in strand breakage and inhibition of
replication. Restoration of damaged DNA is by nucleotide
excision repair (NER), whereas glutathione-S-transferase
(GST) enzymes play a detoxification role. The influence of
NER and GST polymorphisms are well described in solid
and hematological malignancies.5,9,18-21 Increased lung
relapse and improved overall survival in GSTM1 null and
GSTT1 null patients, respectively, was recently reported in
80 osteosarcoma patients.22 A further small study reported
an association between excision repair cross-complementation group 2 (ERCC2) c.2251A>C p.Lys751Gln, poor histological response, and inferior survival.23
We hypothesized that pharmacogenomic profiling of
osteosarcoma patients may facilitate optimization of current regimens with the aim of improved outcome and a
decreased burden of late effects. For this pilot study, 21
genes were selected from MAP pharmacological pathways
(www.pharmgkb.org). From these genes, 35 candidate
polymorphisms were identified on the basis of previously
described associations or putative functional effects (Table
1). One cell-cycle protein polymorphism was also included,
based on previously described associations. The primary
aim was investigation of possible associations between
genetic polymorphisms in drug target and metabolizing
pathways of MAP chemotherapy and response to treatment
in osteosarcoma; the secondary aim was investigation of
polymorphic associations with treatment-related renal,
cardiac, hematological, and ototoxicity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Recruitment
Patients aged >16 years who had completed MAP chemotherapy for histologically proven osteosarcoma were eligible for enrollment. The study protocol was approved by
the local research ethics committee, and patients provided

written informed consent. Clinical data recorded at study
entry included age at diagnosis, sex, ethnic group, tumor
site, histology, presence of metastasis, surgical intervention (reconstruction or amputation), histological response
(degree of tumor necrosis found histologically in the surgical resection specimen defined as good response [>90%
necrosis] or poor response [90%]2), time to and site of
relapse, and length of follow-up. Treatment-related data
included number of administered chemotherapy cycles,
delays and dose modifications, total cumulative doxorubicin and cisplatin exposure (mg/m2), adjuvant radiotherapy, and therapy at relapse.
MAP Chemotherapy
The MAP regimen comprises 6 chemotherapy cycles, 2
preoperative and 4 postoperative. In week 1 of cycles 1 to
4, patients receive doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin
120 mg/m2, followed by methotrexate 12 g/m2 at weeks 4
and 5. In cycles 5 and 6, patients receive doxorubicin 75
mg/m2 alone at week 1 followed by methotrexate 12 g/m2
at weeks 3 and 4. Toxicity assessment was performed
before each cycle, graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE).
Chemotherapy Toxicity
CTCAE grades for infection, mucositis, and myelosuppression were recorded for each drug and cycle. Renal,
cardiac, and auditory function was recorded at diagnosis,
preoperatively, and at end of treatment measured by isotopic glomerular filtration rate (GFR; mL/min/1.73m2),
cardiac ejection fraction (EF), and audiogram, respectively. Treatment-related cardiac toxicity, nephrotoxicity,
and ototoxicity were defined as: early ¼ decrease in EF,
GFR, and audiogram by 1 CTCAE grade from diagnosis to cycle 2; and end of treatment ¼ decrease in EF,
GFR, and audiogram by 1 CTCAE grade from diagnosis to end of treatment.
DNA Extraction and Amplification
Two 5-mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid venous blood
samples were obtained from all subjects at recruitment.
Lymphocytic genomic DNA was extracted from 5 mL
whole blood using the Qiagen FlexiGene kit (Qiagen,
Crawley, UK). DNA yield, integrity, and protein contamination were checked by spectrophotometry. Manual genotyping was performed for thymidylate synthase variable
numbers of tandem repeats, G/C SNPs, and DHFR insertions/deletions using standard polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism

techniques as previously described.14,24 Multiplex PCR was
used to detect homozygous deletions of GSTT1 and
GSTM1 with primers for the housekeeping gene BCL2 as
an internal control.25 Fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.
Final assignment of genotypes was confirmed by a clinician
scientist blinded to patient outcomes.
SNP Microarray Analysis
The Illumina 610-Quad SNP array was used for microarray analysis of DNA in accordance with Illumina guidelines (Illumina, San Diego, Calif). After an initial quality
check on 1% agarose gel, 300 ng of high-quality DNA
was whole genome amplified, fragmented, precipitated,
and resuspended. Samples were denatured and arrays
loaded by a Tecan liquid handling robot (Tecan Group,
Männedorf, Switzerland). After hybridization for 16 to
24 hours at 48 C, single base extension and labeling with
Cy3 and Cy5 monoreactive dyes was performed. All
reagents were supplied by Illumina. Genotypes were
assigned using BeadStudio version 3 software (Illumina).
Statistical Analysis
Candidate SNPs with minor allele frequency <0.05 or
deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P < .001
were excluded. Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact tests were
used to analyze demographic, clinical, and genotypic data.
In addition to wild-type, heterozygous, and variant homozygous forms, genotypes were grouped as dichotomous variables on the basis of their phenotypic consequences.
Highest recorded CTCAE grades were grouped as
binary variables (grade 0-2; grade 3-4) for each drug cycle.
Associations between genotypes and toxicity were calculated by logistic regression analysis and presented as odds
ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Where small sample size resulted in the statistical phenomenon of separation, ORs and CIs were calculated by
penalized log-likelihood regression.26 Multivariate logistic

regression analysis of cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity
included doxorubicin and cisplatin exposure (mg/m2) as
covariates, respectively. Student t test was used to investigate differences between mean diagnostic and end of treatment EF and GFR with respect to genotype.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from
the start of chemotherapy to first disease recurrence.
Patients without disease recurrence at final analysis were
censored at last follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to calculate survival probabilities, and log-rank
test was used to compare differences in PFS. Overall survival was not analyzed, as because of small patient numbers it was not informative. Cox proportional hazards
model was used for calculation of hazard ratios (HRs) in
multivariate analysis, with predictors of survival identified
in univariate analysis as covariates (tumor primary site,
metastasis at diagnosis). All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill)
and Stata 10 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex). Reported
P values were 2-sided, and a value of .05 was considered
statistically significant. Adjustment for multiple testing
was not performed, as P values and CIs were felt to be
more informative in the setting of a small pilot study.

etoposide were excluded from renal toxicity analysis. Ototoxicity analysis was not performed because of incomplete
data. At least 1 episode of grade 3-4 toxicity was experienced by 46 (79%) patients after methotrexate, 54 (93%)
after doxorubicin/cisplatin, and 40 (69%) after doxorubicin cycles.
Median diagnostic EF was 63% (interquartile range
[IQR], 57-66), and doxorubicin exposure was 444 mg/m2
(IQR, 386-453). Early and end of treatment cardiotoxicity was recorded in 16 (29%) and 25 (45%) patients,
respectively. A deterioration in cardiac function by 2
CTCAE grades from diagnosis to end of treatment was
seen in 10 (18%) patients.
Median diagnostic GFR was 110 mL/min/1.73 m2
(IQR, 97.5-127), and cisplatin exposure was 474 mg/m2
(IQR, 443-480 mg/m2). Early and end of treatment
nephrotoxicity was recorded in 18 (33%) and 33 (60%)
patients, respectively. A deterioration in renal function by
2 CTCAE grades from diagnosis to end of treatment
was seen in 5 (9%) patients.

Genotype Information
Genotype frequencies were consistent with previously
reported studies, with no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Two SNPs with minor allele frequency
<0.05 (NQO1 c.415C>T p.Arg139Trp and GSTP1
c.341C>T p.Ala114Val) were excluded from further analysis. Genotype showed no association with age, primary
site, or histology. TYMS group 2 (2R/3G, 3G/3C, 3G/
3G) was over-represented in males (P ¼ .016) and wildtype MTHFR c.677C>T p.Ala222Val over-represented in
non-Caucasians (P ¼ .015). Metastasis at diagnosis was
associated with CCND1 c.870A>G p.Pro241Pro wildtype homozygotes (OR, 9; 95% CI, 1.4-57.9; P ¼ .021)
and ERCC1 c.354T>C p.Asn118Asn variant homozygotes (TT; OR, 12; 95% CI, 1.3-112; P ¼ .03).

Histological Response
Poor histological response was significantly increased in
variants of ABCC2 c.24C>T (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.428.5; P ¼ .017) and GSTP1 c.313A>G p.Ile105Val heterozygotes (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 1.6-37.5; P ¼ .01), whereas
MTHFD1 c.1958G>A p.Arg653Gln was protective (OR,
0.2; 95% CI, 0.05-0.8; P ¼ .03). Data for significantly
associated polymorphisms are presented in Table 3.

PFS
In univariate analysis, decreased PFS was seen in wildtype homozygotes of CCND1 c.870A>G p.Pro241Pro
(P ¼ .018), in variant carriers of GSTP1 c.313A>G
p.Ile105Val (P ¼ .025) and RFC c.80G>A p.Arg27His
(log rank P ¼ .02), and in the GSTT1 null allele (P ¼

multivariate analysis (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 0.9-11.6; P ¼
.075). Multivariate logistic regression suggested a trend
between relapse and RFC c.80G>A p.Arg27His (OR,

in Table 4.
Chemotherapy Toxicity
Significant genotypic associations with grade 3-4 chemotherapy toxicities are shown in Table 5, presented according to administered drug cycle.
Cardiotoxicity and Nephrotoxicity
Multivariate analysis of genotypic associations with cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity are shown in Table 6.

DISCUSSION
Understanding and overcoming the interindividual variation in drug response and toxicity remains among the
major challenges in cancer chemotherapy. This pilot study
explored the pharmacogenomics of osteosarcoma chemotherapy and although limited by small sample size secondary to retrospective recruitment and the rarity of this
tumor, it remains the most comprehensive study to date.
Herein, we observed several novel polymorphic associations as well as confirming several previously reported
Cancer

findings. Cautious interpretation is required, but we
believe further investigation is warranted.
Several strengths have optimized the value of the
dataset obtained. First, the selection of candidate polymorphisms was based on the established pharmacological
pathways of each MAP drug, functional data, and previous associations reported in the literature. Second,
detailed recording and analysis of chemotherapy toxicity
according to drug adds rigor, as many studies combine
toxicities of multidrug regimens despite actions on several
different pharmacological pathways. Third, MAP is a prolonged and intense chemotherapy regimen with extensive
patient monitoring, providing a comprehensive overview
of individual toxicity. Finally, predictors of survival
identified by univariate analysis were used as covariates in
multivariate analysis of survival.
Multidrug chemotherapy has significantly improved
survival in nonmetastatic osteosarcoma, but the proportion of patients cured has remained static for 2 or more
decades. The identification of markers of subclinical metastatic or resistant disease may allow early treatment intensification, potentially salvaging some patients. Wild-type
CCND1 c.870A>G p.Pro241Pro was over-represented in
patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis, which is intriguing, as this genotype is also associated with poor survival in ALL.27 Cyclin D1 assumes a key role in cell cycle
progression; the wild-type allele of c.870A>G p.Pro241Pro encodes a truncated CCND1 protein resistant to nuclear export, enhancing its oncogenicity. The importance
of CCND1 in osteosarcoma has previously been reported,
both in Notch-mediated tumor growth and by RNA interference inhibiting proliferation of tumor cell lines.28,29

Thus c.870A>G p.Pro241Pro may impose far-reaching
cellular consequences, suggesting that the association with
metastatic disease deserves more extensive investigation.
The relationship between poor histological response
and inferior survival is well established in osteosarcoma,
with the concept of later treatment intensification to rescue these patients currently being explored in an international clinical trial.2,30 Lacking at present is a means of
identifying patients at risk of poor response at diagnosis.
This study observed 2 novel polymorphic associations
with poor response but did not replicate a reported association with ERCC2 c.2251A>C p.Lys751Gln.23

1862

Poor response was associated with ABCC2
c.24C>T in a dose-dependent manner. Previously in 44
pediatric ALL patients treated with high-dose methotrexate, female carriers of the c.24C>T variant allele showed
a 2-fold increase in plasma levels, suggesting reduced
efflux.11 High plasma methotrexate levels confer a greater
risk of toxic side effects, possibly decreasing subsequent
chemotherapy dose intensity, an important factor in osteosarcoma response.31 There are further treatment implications, as cisplatin and doxorubicin are also effluxed by
ABCC2.9,12 However, in contrast to our findings,
enhanced response to platinum-based chemotherapy was

reported in Chinese patients with nonsmall cell lung
cancer.9
Poor response was also associated with GSTP1
c.313A>G p.Ile105Val. GSTP1 is widely expressed in
human epithelium, with overexpression contributing to
both cisplatin and doxorubicin resistance in osteosarcoma.32 GSTP1 has 2 common polymorphisms,
c.313A>G p.Ile105Val and c. 341C>T p.Ala114Val, the 4
alleles showing significant differences in their abilities to
protect against anticancer agents.33 There are no published data on the influence of GSTP1 c.313A>G
p.Ile105Val in osteosarcoma disease response, although
extensive research exists in other malignancies, much of it
conflicting.5,9,18-20,34-36
A trend toward osteosarcoma relapse in variant
homozygotes of RFC c.80G>A p.Arg27His replicated a
previous report in ALL, where higher plasma methotrexate levels suggested reduced RFC function.13 In osteosarcoma, compromised intracellular methotrexate transport,
enzyme inhibition and drug polyglutamylation have
potentially devastating consequences for disease control as
the efficacy of high-dose methotrexate relies heavily on
polyglutamylation. Furthermore, sensitivity to cisplatin, a
pivotal drug in MAP chemotherapy, correlates with RFC
expression in human tumor cell lines.37
MAP chemotherapy imposes significant early and
long-term side effects. The early identification of patients
at risk of severe toxicity may facilitate improved monitoring and early intervention to minimize morbidity. In
addition, as the absence of chemotherapy toxicity may
predict poor outcome in osteosarcoma, the identification

Cancer

of those at risk of chemoresistance is of equal importance.38 Several ABC polymorphisms influenced methotrexate toxicity, an observation not previously reported. In
ALL, high methotrexate levels were associated with
ABCC2 polymorphisms, although not c.3563T>A
p.Val1188Glu as was found in our study. The gene however exhibits a high degree of linkage disequilibrium, perhaps explaining this association.11 The possible
association of ABCG2 with toxicity may be explained by
its function as the only folate transporter capable of effluxing polyglutamates, the latter critical for prolongation of
methotrexate activity.
ERCC1 c.354T>C p.Asn118Asn and ERCC1
c.1510C>A p.Gly504Lys were associated with gastrointestinal and hematological toxicity, as might have been
predicted from the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin/cisplatin. The former showed no association in >1000 ovarian
and colorectal cancer patients, but the latter was in concordance with previous reports of increased gastrointestinal toxicity in cisplatin-treated nonsmall cell lung
cancer.5,19,39 One study in osteosarcoma reported no
association of ERCC1 c.354T>C p.Asn118Asn with cisplatin-induced hearing loss but did not investigate other
chemotherapy toxicities.23
Myelosuppression was increased in variants of
GSTP1 c.313A>G p.Ile105Val, the same genotype implicated in poor histological response and PFS. Previously
reported associations are inconsistent, with enhanced neurotoxicity observed in platinum-treated colorectal cancer
but no association with toxicity in a large ovarian cancer
patient cohort.5,19 We speculate that increased

oxidative stress; GSTP1 is pivotal in myocyte protection
through its role in glutathione conjugation and peroxidase
activity. Reduced function by GSTP1 c.313A>G
p.Ile105Val may compromise the already reduced oxidative stress capacity of doxorubicin-exposed cardiac
myocytes, facilitating cardiac damage. As a proven cardioprotectant is available, pretreatment identification of individual cardiotoxicity risk offers the potential to reduce the
burden of late cardiac damage, particularly as high-dose
doxorubicin is likely to remain a fundamental component
of osteosarcoma therapy.
High-dose methotrexate and cisplatin may both
cause acute renal damage and long-term insufficiency.
Early nephrotoxicity was increased in variants of ERCC2
c.2251A>C p.Lys751Gln, and although a small decrease
in GFR is of arguable clinical significance, the impact on
early chemotherapy dose intensity is potentially important. Cisplatin nephrotoxicity is mediated through renal
ischemia, a tumor necrosis factor-a inflammatory
response, and generation of reactive oxygen species by
apoptotic cellular signaling pathways.40 ERCC2 removes
oxidative DNA damage; thus, altered function by
c.2251A>C p.Lys751Gln may expose renal tubules to
greater oxidative stress, enhancing renal toxicity.
A trend toward early nephrotoxicity was seen with
MTHFR c.677C>T p.Ala222Val, previously associated
with acute renal failure after high-dose methotrexate.41
The variant allele has been associated with diabetic nephropathy but also correlates with hyperhomocysteinemia

that is directly toxic to glomerular cells.42 It is possible
that variant carriers of MTHFR c.677C>T p.Ala222Val
are more susceptible to both methotrexate toxicity and
direct renal damage.
This exploratory study has demonstrated several
polymorphic associations with disease outcome and
chemotherapy toxicity in osteosarcoma, but it must be reemphasized that the study is retrospective and limited by
small sample size. Nonetheless, some may have important
implications for patient management and deserve validation in a larger, prospective cohort. It is hoped that prospective pharmacogenomic profiling will be undertaken
in patients entered into future international clinical trials,
the ultimate goal being the prediction of aggressive disease, poor clinical outcome, or severe toxic effects.
