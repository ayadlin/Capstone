Abstract

Introduction

The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has
emerged as an exciting molecular target. Derivatives of the
natural product geldanamycin, such as 17-allylamino-17demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG), were the first HSP90
ATPase inhibitors to enter clinical trial. Synthetic smallmolecule HSP90 inhibitors have potential advantages. Here,
we describe the biological properties of the lead compound
of a new class of 3,4-diaryl pyrazole resorcinol HSP90 inhibitor (CCT018159), which we identified by high-throughput
screening. CCT018159 inhibited human HSP90B with comparable potency to 17-AAG and with similar ATP-competitive
kinetics. X-ray crystallographic structures of the NH2-terminal
domain of yeast Hsp90 complexed with CCT018159 or its
analogues showed binding properties similar to radicicol.
The mean cellular GI50 value of CCT018159 across a panel
of human cancer cell lines, including melanoma, was 5.3
Mmol/L. Unlike 17-AAG, the in vitro antitumor activity of
the pyrazole resorcinol analogues is independent of NQO1/
DT-diaphorase and P-glycoprotein expression. The molecular
signature of HSP90 inhibition, comprising increased expression of HSP72 protein and depletion of ERBB2, CDK4, C-RAF,
and mutant B-RAF, was shown by Western blotting and
quantified by time-resolved fluorescent-Cellisa in human
cancer cell lines treated with CCT018159. CCT018159 caused
cell cytostasis associated with a G1 arrest and induced
apoptosis. CCT018159 also inhibited key endothelial and
tumor cell functions implicated in invasion and angiogenesis.
Overall, we have shown that diaryl pyrazole resorcinols
exhibited similar cellular properties to 17-AAG with potential
advantages (e.g., aqueous solubility, independence from NQO1
and P-glycoprotein). These compounds form the basis for
further structure-based optimization to identify more potent
inhibitors suitable for clinical development. [Cancer Res

The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)
regulates the stability, activation, and biological function of
numerous oncogenic client proteins, including steroid hormone
receptors, kinases (e.g., ERBB2, C-RAF, B-RAF, and CDK4), and
other proteins (e.g., mutant p53, hTERT, and HIF1a; ref. 1). The
HSP90 chaperone machine is driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis
(2). Its activity is regulated by co-chaperones (e.g., HSP72, CDC37,
P23, CHIP, and immunophilins) that affect the balance between
stabilization and degradation of clients via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (3, 4). HSP90 inhibitors are therefore of interest.
Therapeutic selectivity for cancer versus normal cells could derive
from the stressed conditions associated with malignancy (5),
oncogene addiction, and the greater dependence on HSP90 of
mutated versus wild-type oncoproteins, as exemplified recently
with B-RAF (6, 7). Because HSP90 client proteins are associated
with many oncogenic signaling pathways, pharmacologic blockade
of HSP90 function should deliver a combinatorial effect on all the
hallmark traits of malignancy (8).
The complex natural products geldanamycin and radicicol
(Fig. 1) bind at the NH2-terminal ATP site and inhibit the ATPase
activity (9). This targets client proteins for proteasomal degradation (10, 11), most probably via recruitment of ubiquitin ligases like
CHIP (3). Geldanamycin exhibited potent antitumor activity
against human cancer cells (12), but significant toxicities precluded
its clinical development (13). The geldanamycin derivative 17allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG; Fig. 1) exhibited
a greater therapeutic window (14–16). Several phase I clinical trials
of 17-AAG have been completed (17–19). These showed that 17AAG is well tolerated with satisfactory pharmacokinetic exposures,
leading to HSP90 inhibition as shown by the accepted molecular
signature (17, 20). Prolonged stable disease was observed in two
patients with metastatic malignant melanoma (17), and responses
were also observed in breast cancer and multiple myeloma (21, 22).
Despite these promising results, 17-AAG has potential drawbacks, including limited aqueous solubility with resulting formulation issues, low oral bioavailability (23), variable metabolism by
the polymorphic enzymes CYP3A4 (24) and NQO1/DT-diaphorase
(15, 25), and hepatotoxicity (17–19). 17-DMAG (26) and the
hydroquinone IPI-504 (27), which exhibit improved aqueous
solubility, have entered phase I clinical trials. Radicicol analogues
showed in vivo activity in human tumor xenografts (28) but have
not progressed to the clinic.
Experience with the natural products generated interest in
alternative chemotypes (29–31). The first synthetic small-molecule

Diaryl Pyrazole Resorcinol HSP90 Inhibitors

Figure 1. Chemical structures of the different classes of HSP90 inhibitors.

NH2-terminal ATP site–binding inhibitors were designed by Chiosis
et al. based on a purine scaffold (32, 33). Purines with improved
aqueous solubility and oral bioavailability have been described (33).
Using high-throughput screening to identify inhibitors of the
intrinsic NH2-terminal ATPase activity of yeast Hsp90 (34), we
discovered the novel synthetic 3,4-diaryl pyrazole resorcinol
inhibitor CCT018159 (35). Structure-based design generated a
series of active analogues (36, 37). Here, we provide the first
detailed characterization of the biological properties of CCT018159
and related derivatives. The results show that CCT018159 is a
representative of a new class of fully synthetic molecules with
potential for development as novel anticancer agents.

Materials and Methods
HSP90 inhibitors. Diaryl pyrazole resorcinols were synthesized as
described (35). 17-AAG and radicicol were from Axxora Ltd. (Nottingham,
United Kingdom) and Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom),
respectively. Geldanamycin was supplied by the National Cancer Institute
(Rockville, MD). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO.
Cell lines. Unless otherwise stated, all cell lines were from the American
Type Culture Collection (LGC Promochem, Middlesex, United Kingdom). All
human cancer cell lines were grown in DMEM /10% FCS, 2 mmol/L
glutamine, and nonessential amino acids in 5% CO2. The human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the prostate carcinoma cell line PC3LN3
were cultured as described (38). MCF10a cells derived from human

www.aacrjournals.org

mammary gland were maintained in DMEM-Ham’s F12 mix (Invitrogen
Ltd., Paisley, United Kingdom) and 10% FCS, 10 Ag/mL insulin, 20 ng/mL
epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, and 500 ng/mL
hydrocortisone. The human prostate epithelial cell line PNT2, immortalized
with SV40 (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Wiltshire, United
Kingdom), was grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) and 10% FCS. All lines were
free of Mycoplasma contamination (Venor GeM kit, Minerva Biolabs, Berlin,
Germany).
Production of recombinant HSP90 and AHA1. Expression and
purification of recombinant full-length human HSP90h, full-length yeast
Hsp90, and NH2-terminal domain and yeast AHA1 was as described (39, 40).
X-ray crystallography. Crystallization of the yeast Hsp90 NH2-terminal
domain has been described (39). An aliquot (5 AL) of inhibitor at 50 mmol/L
stock concentration was added to 1 mL of HSP90 NH2-terminal domain at
4 mg/mL in 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5) and 1 mmol/L EDTA. The complex was
concentrated to 200 AL (20 mg/mL) and crystallized by the hanging drop
method.
Isothermal titration calorimetry and K d determinations. Heats of
interaction were measured as described (9). Briefly, 10 aliquots of 27 AL
compound (100 Amol/L) were injected into 10 Amol/L recombinant fulllength human HSP90h at 30jC in 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L EDTA,
5 mmol/L NaCl, and 1% DMSO.
Colorimetric determination of ATPase activity. Inhibition of ATPase
activity of recombinant yeast Hsp90 or recombinant human HSP90h in the
presence of the co-chaperone AHA1 (40) was determined using the malachite
green assay (34). Briefly, different inhibitor concentrations were added to 400
Amol/L ATP (Sigma-Aldrich), 400 nmol/L yeast Hsp90 or 2 Amol/L human
HSP90h and 30 Amol/L AHA1 in 100 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mmol/L
KCl, and 6 mmol/L MgCl2. IC50 values were determined as the concentration
causing 50% inhibition compared with vehicle controls.
K i values against recombinant full-length human HSP90 ATPase activity
were determined as follows. Enzyme activity for 3.3 Ag protein was assayed at
2.5 Amol/L compound across a range of ATP concentrations (0.2–2 mmol/L).
The double reciprocal plot of 1/velocity against 1/substrate concentration
was used to determine the type of inhibition and a secondary plot of
x intercept against concentration generated K i values (Graphpad Prism,
San Diego, CA).
Biochemical selectivity of CCT018159. The malachite green assay (34)
was used to determine the biochemical selectivity of CCT018159 versus
human HSP72 ATPase activity (SPP-776F; Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) at
400 Amol/L ATP and 1.2 Amol/L protein. Selectivity towards human
topoisomerase II ATPase was determined using DNA decatenation to
measure functional activity (TopoGen assay kit, Port Orange, FL); 200 ng
catenated DNA with 6 units of enzyme were used. Kinase profiling was
carried out by Upstate (Charlottesville, VA).
Fluorescence polarization assay. Competitive binding of inhibitors to
full-length human HSP90h was measured using a fluorescent pyrazole
resorcinol probe (41). Relative binding affinities for HSP90 in lysates from
cancer and nontumorigenic cell lines were also measured by fluorescence
polarization assay.
Growth inhibition assay. Cellular sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors was
measured by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (15). Sensitivity of HUVEC was
determined using an alkaline phosphatase colorimetric method (38). The
GI50 was calculated as the concentration that inhibits cell proliferation by
50% compared with vehicle controls.
Western blotting. Protein extracts and Western blotting were done as
described (15). Antibodies are described in Supplementary Materials.
Time-resolved fluorescence-Cellisa. Full details of time-resolved
fluorescent (TRF)-Cellisa have been described (42).
Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle effects were initially determined using
propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry (16). For more detailed
analysis, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)-Hoechst33258/PI staining was used.
Apoptosis studies. Attached and trypan blue–negative detached cells
were counted using a hemacytometer. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
cleavage was detected by Western blotting using an antibody (Clontech,
Oxford, United Kingdom) that recognizes the 116-kDa native PARP and the
85-kDa apoptosis-related cleavage product (16).

Cancer Research
Functional studies on human endothelial and tumor cells. In vitro
chemomigration in response to soluble ligands, haptotaxis assays
(migration on a solid substrate), and cellular differentiation on Matrigel
using HUVEC and/or PC3LN3 human prostate carcinoma cells and LICRLON-HN6 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells were determined as
described (38, 43).

Results
Protein X-ray crystallography. Protein X-ray crystallography at
1.6 to 2.5Å resolution confirmed that radicicol, CCT018159,
CCT072453, and CCT072440 (Fig. 1) all bind to the ATP site within
the yeast Hsp90 NH2-terminal domain (Fig. 2). The carboxylate side
chain of Asp79 forms two hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2A, left), one via a
tightly bound water molecule, to two of the radicicol oxygens (9).
The same tightly bound water is hydrogen bonded to the mainchain amide group of Gly83 and the hydroxyl side chain of Thr171.
Another hydrogen bond exists between the main-chain carbonyl of
Leu34, via a second water molecule, to a third radicicol oxygen, and
yet another contact is formed between the q-amino side chain of
Lys44 and the radicicol epoxide oxygen. Other interactions are van
der Waals contacts (Asn37, Asp40, Ala41, Ile82, Met84, Phe124, and
Ile173; Fig. 2A, left). The pyrazole resorcinol CCT018159 binds
similarly (35), except that the hydrophilic Lys44 and hydrophobic
Asp40 interactions are lost (Fig. 2A, right). However, an additional
hydrophobic interaction is established with Leu93, whereas the
main-chain carbonyl of Gly83 and one of the ring nitrogens of
CCT018159 form a new hydrophobic contact, as with the other
pyrazole analogues (Fig. 2B ). For CCT072453, the protein
interactions are exactly the same as for radicicol and include
contacts with Lys44 and Asp40 (Fig. 2B, left), but not with Leu93 as
seen for CCT018159. In contrast, for CCT072440, the Lys44 and
Asp40 interactions are lost, and there is also no interaction with
Leu93 (Fig. 2B, right). The 5¶-ethyl group on the resorcinol ring of
CCT018159 and the equivalent 5¶-chloro group of CCT072440 and
CCT072453 reside in a hydrophobic pocket, contributing to
potency (see later). The superimpositions (Fig. 2C) show that the
pyrazole resorcinols and radicicol all occupy a similar space within
the HSP90 ATP-binding site.
HSP90 binding and ATPase inhibition. Isothermal titration
calorimetry with full-length recombinant human HSP90h gave a
dissociation constant (K d) of 0.47 Amol/L for CCT018159. K d values
were about 2-fold lower for the 5¶-chloro analogue CCT072440
(0.24 Amol/L), the 5¶-chloro analogue with a cyanopropyloxy
substituent replacing the dioxan ring CCT072453 (0.25 Amol/L),
and geldanamycin (0.24 Amol/L). The less-potent analogue
CCT066961 (Fig. 1), lacking a chloro or ethyl substituent at C-5 in
the resorcinol ring, gave a K d value of 4.0 Amol/L. Radicicol showed
tighter binding with a K d of 0.007 Amol/L. In the presence of
recombinant human HSP90 ATPase-activating protein AHA1 (40),
CCT018159 binding to HSP90h was similar (K d = 0.37 Amol/L).
Incubation of CCT018159 and geldanamycin for 24 h at room
temperature did not markedly alter the K d (0.53 and 0.32 Amol/L,
respectively).
CCT018159, 17-AAG, and geldanamycin acted as competitive
inhibitors with respect to ATP against the full-length recombinant
human HSP90 ATPase, assayed with AHA1 using the malachite
green method. CCT018159 exhibited a K i of 1.8 F 0.29 Amol/L
(mean F SE, n = 3), which was similar to that for 17-AAG (1.4 F
0.32 Amol/L) and geldanamycin (1.8 F 0.22 Amol/L).
The IC50 value for CCT018159 against the ATPase activity of
full-length yeast Hsp90 at 400 Amol/L ATP was 6.6 F 0.5 Amol/L

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

(mean F SE, n = 3). The 5¶-chloro analogues CCT072440 and
CCT072453 were 10-fold more potent than CCT018159 (Table 1A).
They were also more potent than CCT018159 against the
recombinant full-length HSP90h with AHA1, but the difference
was smaller (Table 1A). The analogue CCT066961, lacking a chloro
or ethyl substituent at C-5 in the resorcinol ring (Fig. 1), was 15-fold
less potent against both yeast and human HSP90 compared with
CCT018159 (Table 1A).
The more sensitive fluorescence polarization assay gave IC50
values for human HSP90h 5- to 10-fold lower than the malachite
green method. CCT072440 and CCT072453 were confirmed as 2- to
3-fold more potent than CCT018159, whereas CCT066961 was
12-fold less potent (Table 1A).
The fluorescence polarization assay was used to determine the
relative binding affinity of CCT018159, 17-AAG, and geldanamycin
for HSP90 in lysates from human tumor cells (HCT116 colorectal
and WM266.4 melanoma) and nontumorigenic cells (HUVECs,
MCF10a human mammary gland epithelial cells, and PNT2 human
prostate epithelial cells). For all three inhibitors, the binding
affinity was similar in lysates from tumor and nontumorigenic cells
(Table 1B). In each case, the IC50 for binding to HSP90 in the cell
lysates was about 2-fold lower than that seen with purified
recombinant HSP90h.
Biochemical selectivity of CCT018159. At 10 and 100 Amol/L
CCT018159, no inhibition was observed against human HSP72

NOTE: (A) Enzyme assays were carried out using full-length yeast Hsp90 or human HSP90h, the latter in the presence of the activating protein AHA1,
using the malachite green method (34). The fluorescence polarization competitive binding assay was carried out with human HSP90h using a
fluorescent pyrazole resorcinol probe (41). Cell growth inhibitory activities are also shown; these were carried out in HCT116 human colon cancer cells
using the SRB endpoint. Values represent mean F SE (n = 3). (B) The amount of cell lysate that gave an anisotropy reading corresponding to 30 nmol/L
human HSP90h was used (4 nmol/L for HCT116 and PNT2 cells and 12 nmol/L for WM266.4, HUVEC, and MCF10a cells). Values represent mean F SE
(n = 3–5).

ATPase or the decatenation activity of human topoisomerase II. In
a panel of 20 representative kinases, CCT018159 at 50 Amol/L
showed <50% inhibition in 13 of these kinases (Supplementary
Table S1). The greatest activity was against LCK (98% inhibition).
Note, however, that the concentration used was much higher than
the IC50 for HSP90h (Table 1).
Antiproliferative activity. The growth-inhibitory potencies of
CCT018159, CCT072440, and CCT072453 in HCT116 human colon
carcinoma cells, measured by SRB assay, were similar (GI50 = 4.1–
6.8 Amol/L; Table 1A). CCT066961 was less active, consistent with
its lower potency against HSP90h.
The growth-inhibitory activity of CCT018159 was determined
against a range of human cancer cell lines. Although CCT018159
was less potent than 17-AAG, in some lines (e.g., CH1 ovarian
and BE colon carcinoma), the difference was only 3.6- to 10-fold
(Table 2). The mean GI50 (FSE) for CCT018159 across the tumor
cell panel was 5.3 F 2.5 Amol/L, with the lowest GI50 seen in the
MCF7 breast cancer cells (1.4 F 0.05 Amol/L) and CH1 cells (2.6 F
0.4 Amol/L). Except for the more resistant HT29 colon carcinoma
cell line, the GI50 values for CCT018159 varied only 6-fold from
1.4 Amol/L in MCF7 cells to 8.2 Amol/L in SKMEL 5 melanoma
cells. In contrast, 17-AAG exhibited a 82-fold range across the
cancer cell panel, probably due to varying levels of NQO1 (see
later). CCT018159 undergoes rapid glucuronidation both in mice
and mouse liver microsomes (44). We showed extensive loss of
parent CCT018159 and formation of the corresponding glucuronide in HT29 cells, to a much greater extent than in HCT116 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting an explanation for the resistance of HT29 cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

CCT018159 inhibited HUVEC proliferation with a GI50 of 0.87 F
0.3 Amol/L (mean F SE, n = 3; Table 2). This indicates greater
sensitivity than the tumor cells and is consistent with inhibitory
effects of CCT018159 on the functions of activated endothelial cells
described later. In contrast, nonmalignant prostate cells (PC3LN3)
exhibited similar sensitivity to CCT018159 when compared with
majority of the tumor cells tested, whereas mammary epithelial
cells (MCF10a) were more resistant. For 17-AAG, HUVEC response
was similar to, but not greater than, that of the more sensitive
cancer cells. The nontumorigenic breast and prostate epithelial cell
lines had GI50 values close to those for the more resistant tumor
cell lines.
Effect of NQO1/DT-diaphorase on cellular sensitivity to
HSP90 inhibitors. We previously reported that cancer cells with
low NQO1 levels were much less sensitive to 17-AAG and proposed
that this is due to reduction of the quinone to a more active HSP90
inhibitor (15). Recent studies confirmed that the greater activity of
17-AAG in high NQO1 cell lines was caused by metabolism to the
more potent hydroquinone (25). Hence, we investigated the effect
of NQO1 expression on sensitivity to CCT018159, which lacks the
quinone moiety (Fig. 1). The melanoma cell lines exhibit a range of
NQO1 activities (15), with SKMEL 5 and WM266.4 expressing the
highest levels, SKMEL 28 expressing intermediate level, and SKMEL
2 expressing the lowest activity. This reflects the order of sensitivity
to 17-AAG (Table 2). Cellular sensitivity of CCT018159 in the
melanoma cell lines did not correlate with NQO1 status. As before
(15), 17-AAG was much less active in the BE human colon tumor
cells, which carry an inactivating NQO1 polymorphism, compared
with HT29 counterparts with naturally high NQO1 levels (P <

0.0001; Table 2). Furthermore, 17-AAG was confirmed as less active
(P < 0.0001; Table 2) in the BE vector control line compared with its
isogenic counterpart transfected with the NQO1 gene and
expressing similar high NQO1 activity to HT29 cells (15). In
contrast, CCT018159 showed no differences in potency between
this isogenic pair (P = 0.9; Table 2). The GI50 values for the 5¶-chloro
analogue CCT072453 in the BE vector control and transfected BE2
cell lines were also similar (11.0 F 2.1 and 11.9 F 1.3 Amol/L,
respectively; mean F SE, n = 3; P = 0.2). These results indicate that
unlike 17-AAG, the activity of the pyrazole resorcinols is
independent of NQO1.
Sensitivity of acquired drug-resistant cancer cells to HSP90
inhibitors. We previously reported that P-glycoprotein, the product
of the MDR1 multidrug resistance gene, confers resistance to 17-AAG
(15). We confirmed that 17-AAG was 4.6-fold less active (P < 0.0001)
in the doxorubicin-induced, drug-resistant variant CH1doxR compared with the parental CH1 human ovarian cancer cell line. In
contrast, CCT018159 showed no difference in activity between the
two lines (P = 0.1; Table 2). The 5¶-chloro analogues CCT072453 and
CCT072440 also exhibited no cross-resistance (GI50 for CCT072453 =
6.8 F 2.4 Amol/L in the parental CH1 cells and 4.0 F 1.2 Amol/L
in CH1doxR; GI50 for CCT072440 = 2.5 F 0.8 and 2.9 F 1.1 Amol/L
in CH1 and CH1doxR, respectively; P > 0.1). The MDR1 reversal agent
R -verapamil reduced the level of doxorubicin resistance to
17-AAG in the CH1doxR from 4.6- to 1.3-fold (GI50 values for 17AAG plus 6 Amol/L R-verapamil in CH1 and CH1doxR were 0.8 F
0.02 and 1.0 F 0.01 Amol/L, respectively). No R-verapamil–induced
changes in GI50 values were observed with CCT018159 (P > 0.1; data
not shown). These results suggest that the pyrazole resorcinols are
not subject to P-glycoprotein–mediated multidrug resistance.

The in vitro potencies of CCT018159 and 17-AAG were also
compared in the HT29 human colon cancer cell line and its
counterpart with acquired resistance to oxaliplatin (45). CCT018159
and 17-AAG exhibited similar cellular activity in the HT29oxaliR
cells compared with the parental line (P = 0.14 and 0.9 for
CCT018159 and 17-AAG, respectively; Table 2). Thus, both HSP90
inhibitors are able to retain activity in these platinum-resistant cells.
Molecular signature of HSP90 inhibition induced by
CCT018159. 17-AAG causes depletion of client proteins, such
as C-RAF, ERBB2, and CDK4, and induction of HSP72 in human
cancer cell lines (14–16). This molecular signature of HSP90
inhibition was validated in human tumor xenografts and used to
confirm the mechanism of action of 17-AAG in patients (17, 20).
Both CCT018159 and 17-AAG induced HSP72 and decreased
C-RAF, ERBB2, and CDK4 expression in SKMEL 28 melanoma
cells (Fig. 3A). A similar level of HSP72 induction and depletion
of client proteins by CCT018159 or 17-AAG was also seen in
other human cancer cells (e.g., A2780 and CH1 ovarian cells and
HT29 and HCT116 colon cells; data not shown except for A2780;
Supplementary Fig. S2). The detailed kinetics of client protein
depletion was cell line dependent. For example, CCT018159
depleted C-RAF more rapidly in the A2780 line compared with
SKMEL 28 (Supplementary Fig. S2; Fig. 3A). However, ERBB2 was
consistently the most sensitive client protein, as measured by
both rapid disappearance (Fig. 3A) and by concentrationresponse data (i.e., depletion at 1  GI50; data not shown).
The 5¶-chloro analogues CCT072440 and CCT072453 also showed
the same HSP90 inhibition signature in HCT116 cells (data not
shown). The less active analogue CCT066961 exhibited no HSP72
induction or client protein depletion at 28 Amol/L (equivalent to

5  GI50 CCT018159; Fig. 3B). TRF-Cellisa showed a 2- to 3-fold
increase in HSP72 protein levels and 20% to 25% reduction in
C-RAF with CCT018159 and CCT072440 in HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
We and others (6, 7) recently reported that oncogenic mutant BRAF is an HSP90 client protein and is degraded following 17-AAG
treatment of melanoma cells. Figure 3C shows that CCT018159 and
17-AAG caused comparable depletion of V600EB-RAF in SKMEL 28
melanoma cells (46). In contrast, no depletion of wild-type B-RAF
was seen in SKMEL 5 cells with CCT018159 (Fig. 3C) or 17-AAG (6).

protein depletion. A, Western blot of SKMEL 28 cells treated with 5  GI50

less potent compound (CCT066961) at 28 Amol/L, which is equivalent to 5  GI50

treatment with HSP90 inhibitors in SKMEL 28 (V600EB-RAF mutation) and

used were 14.5 Amol/L CCT018159 (5  GI50) and 0.105 Amol/L 17-AAG
(5  GI50) in SKMEL 28 cells and 41 Amol/L CCT018159 (5  GI50) in WM266.4
cells. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as
loading control. Representative blots of at least three independent experiments.

Consistent with depletion of C-RAF and mutant B-RAF, CCT018159
reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation without affecting total ERK in SKMEL 28 melanoma
(Fig. 3A) and other cancer cell lines (data not shown).
Cell cycle effects. Flow cytometry with PI staining showed that
CCT018159 or 17-AAG at 5  GI50 concentrations (41 and 0.07
Amol/L, respectively) caused marked accumulation in the G1 phase
in SKMEL 5 (Fig. 4A) and other melanoma lines (data not shown).
Continuous BrdUrd labeling and bivariate Hoechst-PI flow
cytometry showed that both HSP90 inhibitors arrested cells in
the initial G1 or subsequent G*1 phase (Fig. 4A).
Cytostatic versus apoptotic effects. All the melanoma cell lines
treated with CCT018159 or 17-AAG showed a cytostatic growth
inhibitory response up to 96 h (SKMEL 28 cells shown in Fig. 4B).
Treatment of SKMEL 28 cells for 24 h with 14.5 Amol/L CCT018159
or 0.105 Amol/L 17-AAG (both equivalent to 5  GI50 concentrations) caused an increase (6- and 1.9-fold, respectively) in trypan
blue–negative detached cells (Fig. 4C). After 48 h, the number of
detached cells after treatment with 17-AAG increased by 8.1-fold
(data not shown). Cells treated with CCT018159 resulted in an
increased in cell debris after 48 h (data not shown). Apoptosis was
confirmed by PARP cleavage in detached SKMEL 28 cells treated
with CCT018195 or 17-AAG (Fig. 4D). Note in Fig. 4D that equal
amounts of protein were loaded for the detached treated and
control cells, and hence, both also showed similar levels of cleaved
PARP. In the controls, this represented the background level of cell
death. However, the number of apoptotic cells was increased after
treatment with CCT018159 or 17-AAG, when compared with
control (Fig. 4C).
Functional studies in HUVEC and tumor cells. As shown
above (Table 2), HUVECs were very sensitive to growth inhibition
by CCT018159. A 24-h exposure of HUVEC to CCT018159 gave a
dose-dependent increase in HSP72 and decrease in AKT expression
(Fig. 5A). CCT018159 also inhibited expression of the major
angiogenic cytokine receptor (VEGFR-2). CCT018159 induced a
dose-dependent inhibition of HUVEC migration in response to FCS,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and basic fibroblast
growth factor (Fig. 5B). Ability to close a ‘‘wound’’ made in
confluent cell monolayer (haptotaxis) was inhibited by 60% at
5  GI50 concentrations of CCT018159. Reduction of the HSP90
client protein FAK has been shown to delay haptotaxis (38).
CCT018159 reduced FAK phosphorylation at Tyr576/577 (47), with
moderate effects on total FAK (Fig. 5A). CCT018159 reduced the
tubular differentiation of HUVEC plated on Matrigel over 24 to
48 h (Fig. 5C). In the PC3LN3 prostate tumor cell line, haptotaxis
was inhibited by 50% at 5  GI50 concentration of CCT018159. In
addition, differentiation of PC3LN3 and LICR-LON HN6 head and
neck squamous carcinoma tumor cells on Matrigel (which requires
engagement with matrix proteins and cell motility) was reduced by
54% and 72%, respectively, at 5  GI50 concentrations of
CCT018159.
These results show that, as exemplified by CCT018159, the diaryl
pyrazole resorcinols have the potential to inhibit invasion and
angiogenesis as part of their combinatorial anticancer effects, as
previously shown for 17-AAG (38).

Discussion
The widely studied HSP90 inhibitors, such as 17-AAG, geldanamycin, and radicicol, inhibit the essential ATPase activity of HSP90
by competing at the NH2-terminal ATP site (9). However, despite

Figure 4. Effects of CCT018159 on cell growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis. A, representative DNA histograms and BrdUrd-Hoechst/PI cytograms of SKMEL 5 human
melanoma cells following treatment with 41 Amol/L CCT018159 (5  GI50) or 0.07 Amol/L 17-AAG (5  IC50). BrdUrd (10 Amol/L) and CCT018159 (or 17-AAG)
were added at the same time and incubated for 16, 24, 48, and 72 h before fixing with ethanol. Control cells were treated with vehicle and BrdUrd. No BrdUrd or
compound was added to control cells at 0 h. Hoechst/PI stain was added immediately before analysis by flow cytometry. The results were replicated in three
independent experiments. Results showed that SKMEL 5 cells treated with CCT018159 or 17-AAG caused a G1 arrest at 16 h. By 24 h, cells in the original G2 have
moved to the new G*1 phase and remained blocked at that point. B, quantitation of attached total cell counts. SKMEL 28 cells were treated with vehicle control (n) or
14.5 Amol/L CCT018159 (.) or 0.105 Amol/L 17-AAG (4) for 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Attached cells were counted using a hemacytometer. C, detached SKMEL 28 cells
(as % total cells) following treatment with 14.5 Amol/L CCT018159, 0.105 Amol/L 17-AAG, or vehicle control for 24 h. D, quantitation of detached cells. Equal
amounts of protein were loaded from the detached control and treated SKMEL 28 cells after 72 h, and PARP cleavage was detected in both detached populations by
Western blotting. The PARP antibody recognizes the 116-kDa native PARP and the 85-kDa apoptosis-related cleavage product. Lysates from the attached population
(72 h) were used as control. Note, however, that although PARP cleavage is seen in both control and treated samples, both HSP90 inhibitors caused an increase
in the number of detached, apoptotic cells (C ).

promising molecular effects and clinical activity with 17-AAG
(17, 20), the natural product–based inhibitors have significant
limitations and synthetic small-molecule inhibitors are eagerly
sought (30, 31, 37). The first of these were designed by Chiosis et al.
based on the purine scaffold and show considerable promise
(32, 33). Next, the diaryl pyrazole resorcinols were identified by
high-throughput screening (34, 35, 48). Here, we provide the first
detailed description of the biological properties of the lead
compound CCT018159 and two related analogues in human cancer
cell lines and certain nontumorigenic cells.

Protein X-ray crystallography confirmed that the pyrazole
compounds and radicicol, which share the resorcinol unit, bind
in a very similar way to the yeast Hsp90 ATP site in the NH2terminal domain (Fig. 2C). The binding mode involves an intricate
network of hydrogen bond interactions between the phenolic
hydroxyl groups in the resorcinol moiety of the pyrazoles or
radicicol and the protein plus key water molecules. Some specific
differences were identified between the pyrazoles and radicicol
and between the individual pyrazole compounds. In contrast to
radicicol, an additional hydrophilic interaction is established

between the main-chain carbonyl of Gly83 and one of the ring
nitrogens of the pyrazoles. The 5¶-ethyl group in the resorcinol ring
of CCT018159 and the equivalent 5¶-chloro group of CCT072440
and CCT072453 occupy a hydrophobic pocket, contributing to
potency (see later). The crystallography studies were carried out
with yeast Hsp90. The yeast and human enzymes exhibit 88%
similarity (70% identity) between their NH2-terminal domains, with
only two differences within 5 Å of bound ADP. These are Ala38
(human Ser52) and Leu173 (human Val186), which are f4 and 5Å
from the exocyclic N6 of the adenyl ring of ADP, respectively.
Consequently, all the key interactions with ADP, ATP, and various
HSP90 inhibitors are essentially the same. Comparison of the
binding of CCT018159 with the yeast and human HSP90a confirms
a high degree of similarity (36).
Dissociation constants (K d values) determined by isothermal
titration calorimetry were similar for CCT018159 and 17-AAG but
higher than for radicicol. The human HSP90 ATPase-activating
protein AHA1 did not appreciably alter the CCT018159 K d and had
no effect on enzyme inhibition. Compared with CCT018159,
analogues CCT072440 and CCT072453 (Fig. 1) showed improved
binding to, and inhibition of, both yeast protein and human fulllength HSP90, as measured by a variety of assays. Structure-activity
relationships for a larger analogue series supports the importance
of the interaction of 5¶-substituents, especially ethyl and chloro,
with the hydrophobic pocket mentioned above (35–37). Replacement of 5¶-ethyl in CCT018159 with 5¶-chloro in both CCT072440
and CCT072453 improves potency, whereas CCT066961, lacking the
5¶-substituent, is much less potent in all biological assays.
Enzyme kinetic analysis showed that CCT018159, 17-AAG, and
geldanamycin inhibit human HSP90 competitively with respect to
ATP, consistent with the binding mode, and have similar K i values.
Concerning biochemical selectivity, CCT018159 was inactive
against two other ATPases (i.e., the structurally related human
topoisomerase II and the structurally unrelated but biologically
linked HSP72). In addition, CCT018159 exhibited generally weak
activity at 50 Amol/L against various kinases, with the exception of
LCK. Thus, CCT018159 exhibits promising selectivity for a lead
compound against HSP90. It is likely that selectivity will be
improved even further during lead optimization.
In terms of antiproliferative properties against HCT116 human
colon cancer cells, the modest 2- to 3-fold increase in enzyme
potency compared with CCT018159 seen for the 5¶-chloro compounds was not translated into cellular activity, presumably due
to physicochemical and permeability factors. More significantly,
although the pyrazole compounds have similar micromolar
potency against HSP90h to 17-AAG, the latter is more potent in
cells; however, in some tumor lines, the difference was only 3- to
10-fold. This discrepancy between target and cell activity is not
surprising for 17-AAG; several groups have reported that 17-AAG
possesses moderate micromolar target potency while achieving low
nanomolar growth inhibition in many but not all cell lines (15, 49).
Chiosis et al. suggested that the differential cell versus target
potency for 17-AAG may be explained by the physicochemical
characteristics of ansamycins, leading to high intracellular
concentrations (49). Kamal et al. (5) reported that 17-AAG binds
to HSP90 more tightly in the presence of certain co-chaperones,
and that a high-affinity, 17-AAG–sensitive superchaperone complex
predominates in cancer cells compared with normal epithelial and
endothelial cells. This could explain the greater accumulation in
tumor tissue and the reported preferential activity of 17-AAG
towards malignant versus normal cells (49). Interestingly, although

Cancer Research

we found that CCT018159 and 17-AAG were bound about 2-fold
more tightly to HSP90 in cell lysates compared with recombinant
HSP90h, we observed with both CCT018159 and 17-AAG that
binding to HSP90 was comparable in lysates from cancer and
nontumorigenic cells. Similar results were reported by others
(27, 50, 51). One explanation for these apparent discrepancies
between different studies is that geldanamycin exhibits slow tight
binding inhibition, potentially related to conversion of the quinone
to the more potent hydroquinone (25, 27, 50, 51). This is consistent
with our original observation that 17-AAG is much more potent in
cancer cells overexpressing the quinone reductase NQO1, which we
showed reduces 17-AAG (15, 25). We did not observe a timedependent increase in HSP90h binding potency with 17-AAG.
The disparities between various studies could relate to the different
binding probes and experimental conditions, especially the presence of reducing agents. Here, we used a fluorescent CCT018159
derivative as the binding probe and did not include reducing agents.
Of note, Gooljarsingh et al. (50) observed a time-dependent increase
in binding with 17-AAG, but not with an isoxazole analogue related
to CCT018159, in agreement with our results. It seems possible that,
lacking the quinone moiety of the geldanamycins, the biochemical
and cellular pharmacology of the pyrazole resorcinols may be less
complex.
In contrast to 17-AAG, the lack of dependence of the pyrazole
resorcinols on NQO1 was expected as the pyrazoles have no quinone.
NQO1 expression varies across tumor and healthy tissues, and
NQO1 polymorphism is associated with loss of activity (52). Thus,
the independence of the pyrazole resorcinols from NQO1 activity
removes a source of metabolic variability and a potential resistance
mechanism. Quinone metabolism may contribute to ansaymcin liver
toxicity, and it will be interesting to assess the toxicology of the new
series using analogues with optimized pharmacokinetic properties.
As with NQO1, the cellular activities of CCT018159 and its
analogues are also independent of P-glycoprotein expression. In
addition, both the pyrazole resorcinols and 17-AAG are able to
retain activity in cancer cells with acquired resistance to oxaliplatin
where the resistance was associated with reduced platinum-DNA
adduct formation (45). Our results do, however, suggest that care
should be taken in considering the potential for resistance to
CCT018159 and related compounds through metabolism of the
resorcinol moiety to glucuronides. Crystal structures (Fig. 2) show
that these metabolites could not bind HSP90. Uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferases, which catalyze glucuronidation of phenolic hydroxyls, are known to be variably expressed in certain
colon, liver, and kidney cancers (53).
Given previous results with 17-AAG (5), it is of interest to
compare the activity of CCT018159 in cancer versus nonmalignant
cells. Interestingly, HUVECs were particularly sensitive to the
growth inhibition by CCT018159 compared with tumor cells.
However, two other nontumorigenic epithelial cell lines (MCF10a
mammary and PNT2 prostate) showed in general similar or rather
reduced sensitivity sensitive to CCT018159 compared with most of
the tumor lines. With 17-AAG, HUVEC sensitivity approached that
of the most sensitive cancer cells, whereas the nontumorigenic
breast and prostate lines tended to have GI50 values closer to those
of the more resistant cancer lines.
Clinical studies with 17-AAG showed that doses that were quite
well tolerated, apart from issues with the DMSO-containing
formulation, gave good pharmacokinetic exposures resulting in
HSP90 inhibition in tumor biopsies, as shown by the validated
molecular signature of HSP72 up-regulation and down-regulation

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

of C-RAF and CDK4 proteins (17–20). Prolonged stable disease was
seen in two melanoma patients (17). Melanoma cells are commonly
driven by and addicted to the RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein/
ERK kinase (MEK)-ERK pathway (54). In melanomas, where this
pathway is activated by N-RAS mutation resulting in C-RAF
activation, C-RAF depletion by CCT018159 or 17-AAG results in
reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Mutations in B-RAF, particularly
the V600E form, are common in melanoma (55). We and others
showed that B-RAF is a hypersensitive HSP90 client compared with
wild type, and that 17-AAG stimulates B-RAF degradation (6, 7).
Two of the melanoma cell lines used here (SKMEL 2 and SKMEL 5)
have wild-type B-RAF, and SKMEL 28 and WM266.4 cells harbored
mutant B-RAF (V600E and V600D, respectively; ref. 46). Both
CCT018159 and 17-AAG reduced B-RAF protein expression, with
the mutants being more sensitive in each case. As reported for 17AAG (6, 7), CCT018159 sensitivity did not correlate with B-RAF
status in the melanoma cells. Down-regulation of ERK1/2
activation is achieved by HSP90 inhibitors depleting either or both
the C-RAF and mutant B-RAF drivers of the pathway. Thus, their
therapeutic activity may be broader than MEK inhibitors, which
show selective activity in B-RAF mutant melanomas (54).
Both CCT018159 and 17-AAG caused accumulation of melanoma
and other tumor cells in G1, as seen for 17-AAG in several but not all
tumor lines (11, 16). The stage of cell cycle block by HSP90 inhibitors
is cell line and tumor type dependent; for example, G2-M arrest is
seen in some colon cancer cell lines (11, 16). With the melanoma
lines, G1 arrest by both CCT018159 and 17-AAG is consistent with
a predominant effect on the critical RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2
pathway that regulates cyclin D1 expression in this tumor type
(54). In addition to the same cell cycle effects, we show here that
CCT018159 and 17-AAG both induced apoptosis in melanoma cells
at equivalent growth inhibitory concentrations (5  GI50). The
results suggested a greater degree of detached apoptotic cells for
CCT08159 than for 17-AAG at 24 h. At 48 h, more apoptotic cells
were present with 17-AAG, whereas a greater amount of cell debris
was seen with CCT018159. Further studies are required in
melanoma and other cell lines to determine any consistent or cell
line–specific effects that may be seen in the concentration- and
time-dependent effects of the two agents. However, it is clear that
both CCT018159 and 17-AAG induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
CCT018159 modulates expression of several key proteins in
HUVEC, including HSP72, AKT, and VEGFR-2, confirming that it
inhibits HSP90 activity in these cells at concentrations used in
functional assays. CCT018159 inhibited HUVEC chemotactic
responses to soluble ligands, as well as haptotactic motility, which
was associated with decreased FAK phosphorylation. Haptotaxis
and tubular differentiation on Matrigel were also inhibited in two
different types of human tumor cells. Thus, in addition to inhibiting
cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis, the diaryl pyrazole
resorcinol HSP90 inhibitors are likely, as with 17-AAG (38), to exert
antiangiogenic and anti-invasive effects in vivo. We also showed
recently that CCT018159 and 17-AAG induce keratinocyte differentiation (56). Their combinatorial effects on the multiple
phenotypic features of malignancy is a major advantage of HSP90
inhibitors. It is promising that this is shared by the geldanamycin,
purine, and diaryl pyrazole series (8, 30).
Our objective here was to use CCT018159 and its analogues to
exemplify the detailed biological properties of our new diaryl
pyrazole resorcinol series of HSP90 inhibitors. The results show that
CCT018159 represents the prototype of a novel, synthetic HSP90
inhibitor chemotype with potential advantages over 17-AAG in

terms of aqueous solubility, lack of susceptibility to P-glycoprotein,
and independence from metabolism by NQO1. Absence of the
quinone moiety may reduce hepatotoxicity. The resorcinol hydroxyls are, however, subject to glucuronidation. We recently showed
that CCT018159 and its analogues have promising pharmacokinetic
properties in mice (44). Structure-based lead optimization has
produced more active inhibitors with similar cellular potency to 17AAG and considerable potential to become a clinical candidate (36).
Combinatorial action of HSP90 inhibitors against multiple oncogenic proteins and pathways, which provide the opportunity to
modulate all the hallmarks of traits of cancer (8), is a significant
feature of these agents. Given the considerable interest in HSP90 as
an oncology drug target and the potential limitations of 17-AAG, it
seems appropriate to progress several chemical series into
preclinical and clinical development. Studies to date with other
classes of HSP90 inhibitors have clearly indicated their ability to
exhibit therapeutic selectivity for cancer versus normal tissues in
animal models (15, 57). Assessment of therapeutic index will need to
