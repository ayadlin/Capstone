BACKGROUND: Acquired resistance to antiepidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) therapy may be caused by EGFR–v-erb-b2
avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2) heterodimerization and pathway reactivation. In preclinical studies,
inhibiting ErbB2 blocked this resistance mechanism and resensitized cells to anti-EGFR therapy. Cetuximab targets EGFR, whereas
lapatinib inhibits both EGFR and ErbB2. The objective of this phase 1 trial was to assess the safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and
maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of cetuximab and lapatinib in patients with solid tumors. METHODS: Patients received standard
weekly cetuximab with escalating lapatinib doses of 750 mg, 1000 mg, or 1250 mg daily in 3-week cycles. DLTs were monitored
through the end of cycle 2. Pretreatment and post-treatment tumor biopsies and germline DNA samples were obtained for correlative studies. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled, and 18 patients each were evaluable for toxicity and response. Fifty-nine
percent of patients had received prior anti-EGFR therapy. Common toxicities included rash and diarrhea. No patient experienced a
DLT at the highest dose level, and no grade 4 toxicity was observed. Response included no complete responses, 3 partial responses,
9 patients with stable disease, and 6 patients with disease progression, for an overall response rate of 17% and a clinical benefit rate
of 67%. The clinical benefit rate in patients who had previously received anti-EGFR therapy was 70%. The mean treatment duration
was 4.7 cycles (range, 1-14 cycles). Decreased expression of EGFR/ErbB2 pathway components after treatment was correlated with
response, whereas increased expression in the PI3K, Jak/Stat, and MAPK pathways occurred in nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: The
combination of cetuximab and lapatinib was well tolerated, had the expected toxicities, and exhibited notable clinical activity, including in patients who had received previous anti-EGFR therapy. Further clinical study of this combination is warranted. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Successful treatments designed to block epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling include monoclonal antibodies targeting the extracellular domain of the EGFR receptor (cetuximab and panitumumab) as well as inhibitors of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor (erlotinib, afatinib, and gefitinib). Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal
antibody that targets the extracellular domain of the receptor when it is in its homodimer configuration, and it is approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic colorectal and head and neck cancers.
Numerous models explaining acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy have been proposed.1-3 One such proposed mechanism of acquired resistance is through EGFR heterodimerization with v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2 [Her2/neu]), reactivating the EGFR pathway.3-8 Combining anti-EGFR therapy
with anti-ErbB2–targeted agents overcame acquired anti-EGFR resistance in preclinical models of colorectal cancer,
head and neck cancer, and lung cancer cell lines.3,5-9 For example, gefitinib-resistant nonsmall cell lung cancer cells had
high levels of EGFR and ErbB2 dimerization, which, in turn, led to persistent pathway activation.9 The addition of
lapatinib in this model reduced EGFR and ErbB2 heterodimerization as well as EGFR tyrosine residue phosphorylation, leading to diminished phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The combination of cetuximab and gefitinib was not synergistic,

but the combination of cetuximab and lapatinib was synergistic in decreasing cell surface EGFR expression,
reducing EGFR phosphorylation, and inducing apoptosis, all leading to higher rates of cell death.9
On the basis of these preclinical studies, we conducted
a phase 1 dose-finding clinical study of the combination of
cetuximab and lapatinib in patients with diseases for which
there was evidence at the time of the study that they could
be treated efficaciously with cetuximab, including v-Ki-ras2
Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) wildtype colorectal, head and neck, nonsmall cell lung, and anal
cancers.10-13 We performed correlative tumor biopsy and
pharmacogenetic analyses as part of the current study to
explore whether tumor pathway activation and germline
genetic variations correlated with response and toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Adult patients who had refractory solid tumors that were
treatable with cetuximab at the time of the study (Kras wildtype colorectal, nonsmall cell lung, head and neck, and anal
squamous cell cancers) were enrolled in a single-institution,
open-label, dose-escalation, sequential cohort, phase 1 clinical
study at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center of
Georgetown University (Washington, DC). Patients were
required to have measurable disease, adequate organ function, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status from 0 to 2, a normal ventricular ejection fraction, a
life expectancy >3 months, and resolution of reversible toxicities related to prior therapy to grade 1.
Trial Design and Objectives

A 3 1 3 dose escalation design was used to determine the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of
lapatinib and cetuximab. Secondary objectives included
determining clinical activity as well as the translational studies described below. The cycle length was 3 weeks, and
response was assessed every 2 cycles. Initial dose cohorts
included 3 patients. If 1 of 3 patients experienced a doselimiting toxicity (DLT), then an additional 3 patients were
enrolled at that dose level. If 2 of 6 patients experienced a
DLT, then the next lower dose of lapatinib would be determined to be the MTD and the recommended phase 2 dose
(RP2D) when used in combination with cetuximab. At
least 6 patients were to be treated at the RP2D.

diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg. Three dose cohorts of daily
lapatinib were planned at doses of 750 mg (3 tabs), 1000
mg (4 tabs), and 1250 mg (5 tabs) daily. This was because,
although the highest approved dose of lapatinib is 1500 mg
daily, the highest approved dose when combined with
another agent (capecitabine) is 1250 mg daily. Lapatinib
was started on day 1 and had to be taken at least 1 hour
before or after a meal. All patients were treated on a daily
rash-prevention regimen known to reduce rash severity in
patients who receive EGFR-directed monoclonal antibody
therapy (topical 1% hydrocortisone cream, skin moisturizer, sunscreen, and doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, all
starting on day 21 of cycle 1).14
Response and Toxicity

Disease status was assessed radiographically every 2 cycles,
and response was assessed using Response Criteria in Solid
Tumors (version 1.1). Toxicities were assessed using the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (version 3.0). The dermatologic side
effects from anti-EGFR therapy often peak 4 weeks or
later after starting therapy. For this reason, and because we
expected that rash potentially would be our DLT, we
monitored patients for DLTs through the first 2 cycles of
treatment for a total of 6 weeks. This is in contrast to the
usual phase 1 clinical trial design. DLTs were defined as
grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting >5
days, neutropenic infection, or other grade 4 hematologic
toxicity as well as any grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity except alopecia and as follows: for grade 3 acneform
rash, a dose delay of cetuximab therapy was allowed for
up to 2 weeks, and, if it persisted, then it was considered a
DLT; if grade 3 or 4 diarrhea persisted despite optimal
supportive care, then it was a DLT. A cetuximab infusion
reaction was not considered a DLT; instead, the patient
was taken off study and replaced.
For patients who had received previous anti-EGFR
therapies, we compared the time patients were on those
prior therapies with the time they were treated on study
with cetuximab and lapatinib. Furthermore, for patients
whose best treatment response was stable disease (SD) or
better, we compared the progression-free survival (PFS)
duration on study with the PFS duration of the treatment
patients received just before study entry using an approach
similar to that proposed by Von Hoff et al15 by calculating
the ratio of PFS on study/PFS on prior therapy.

Treatment

Treatment included standard cetuximab dosing of 400 mg/
m2 on day 1 and 250 mg/m2 weekly thereafter. Premedications included oral acetaminophen 650 mg and intravenous

CYP3A4, for the first 6 patients, weekly trough lapatinib
pharmacokinetic (PK) levels were measured before that
day’s treatment during cycle 1 while patients were receiving doxycycline. Doxycycline was held during cycle 2, and
additional weekly trough levels were measured, allowing
for intrapatient comparison. PK levels were assessed using
a previously validated method.16
Pharmacogenetic Testing

Germline genetic variations in proteins involved in the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lapatinib
and/or cetuximab were tested and correlated with
response and toxicity. In total, 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested in 8 genes: cyclin D1
(CCND1), ERBB2, EGF, EGFR, FC-gamma receptor IIA
(FccRIIA), cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5 (CYP3A5), and adenosine triphosphate-binding
cassette, subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1). DNA was
extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) obtained from whole blood samples. SNP identification primers (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City,
Calif) were used along with VIC and FAM probes. Samples were run on a 7900 HT Real-Time PCR System
(AME Bioscience, Toroed, Norway) for 40 cycles (at
95 C for 15 seconds then at 60 C for 60 seconds). Data
analysis was performed with the SDS software package
(version 2.1; Applied Biosystems, Inc.).
Tumor Biopsy Analysis

Patients underwent tumor biopsies within 4 weeks of
starting treatment and then at the end of cycle 1. Two
biopsies were obtained at each time point. One was immediately placed on dry ice, and transported to 280 C
freezer storage in <15 minutes to ensure integrity of
protein phosphorylation status. A second biopsy was
placed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Protein
lysates were prepared from each frozen sample and were
robotically immobilized on nitrocellulose-coated slides
along with positive and negative controls. Each array was
interrogated with a highly specific antibody that targeted
a protein (including specific phosphorylated sites on such
proteins) involved in the EGFR pathway using a proprietary reverse-phase protein microarray platform. Paraffinembedded samples were analyzed using antibodies
matched to these target proteins.
In total, 32 proteins were assessed in the EGFR/
ErbB2 pathway and in related downstream pathways,
including MAPK, PI3K, Janus kinase/signal transducer and
activator of transcription (Jak/Stat), and p38 MAPK. The
involvement of other tyrosine kinase receptors also was studCancer

ied, including c-Met (hepatocyte growth factor receptor)
and insulin receptors. Intensity values within each independent spot were subjected to local background subtraction and subtraction of values from nonspecific binding of
the secondary antibody using a matched slide exposed to the
secondary antibody alone. Results were checked manually
for saturation and limits of detection. Staining intensity was
normalized to the total protein intensity value within the
same spot by staining each slide with Sypro Ruby Red total
protein stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., New York,
NY) before primary antibody application.
Statistical Methods

The exact Cochran-Armitage test was used to determine
whether the genotype and the count of genetic polymorphisms were associated with either toxicity or efficacy parameters. Tumor expression levels of the EGFR and
ErbB2 pathway proteins were analyzed in 2 ways: 1) the
Spearman rank-correlation coefficient was used to assess
the relation between the baseline measures determined
from paraffin-embedded samples and response; and 2)
paired specimens were described as the percentage change
from baseline to the level measured in a biopsy after 1
cycle of therapy. Any of the exploratory inferences were
considered interesting for further exploration in later trials
if the P values were < .10.
The protocol was approved by the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center’s scientific review committee
and the Medstar/Georgetown University’s cancer-specific
institutional review board and was overseen by the cancer
center’s data and safety monitoring committee. This was a
registered clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier
NCT01184482).
RESULTS
Patients

Between October 2010 and October 2012, 22 patients
were enrolled and started on therapy (Table 1). Patients
had colorectal (n 5 8), nonsmall cell lung (n 5 8), head
and neck (n 5 4), or anal (n 5 2) cancers. The patient median age was 62 years, and the majority of patients were
women. Patients were heavily pretreated, having received
a median of 3.6 lines of prior therapy for their metastatic/
recurrent disease. In total, 13 patients (59%) had received
previous anti-EGFR therapy.
Treatment and Toxicities by Dose Level

Seven patients were enrolled at dose level 1. The first
patient who received treatment experienced a grade 3 rash
by day 4 of cycle 1 that did not resolve in 2 weeks and,
1647

thus, was deemed a DLT. An additional 5 patients were
enrolled at that dose level, but no grade 3 rash or other
DLT was observed. One patient was taken off study
because of noncompliance. At dose level 2, 9 patients
were enrolled. One patient experienced grade 3 diarrhea
with grade 3 dehydration during cycle 1 despite optimal
medical intervention, and this was considered a DLT. No
other DLTs occurred. Three patients experienced rapid

were not evaluable for toxicity and were replaced. At dose
level 3, 6 patients were enrolled, and none experienced a
DLT. One patient progressed after 2 cycles. The other 5
patients were on treatment for 4, 6, 11, 12, and 14 cycles.
For all patients, the mean number of cycles received was
4.7 (14.1 weeks; range, 1-14 cycles).
Other toxicities observed were those typical for antiEGFR therapy, including rash, diarrhea, and fatigue. No
grade 4 toxicity was observed. No hepatotoxicity was
experienced by any patient.
Toxicities reported during the first 2 cycles or at any
time during treatment that were possibly, probably, or
definitely related to treatment are listed in Table 2. It is
noteworthy that 4 patients (3 patients with SD and 1
patient who achieved a partial response (PR); 1 patient at
dose level 2 and 3 patients at dose level 3) withdrew consent and decided to come off of the study after being on
treatment for 4, 6, 13, and 14 cycles because of prolonged
mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) rash or fatigue, even after
dose modification.
Response

Of the 22 enrolled patients, 18 were evaluable for
response. No patient had a complete response (CR), 3
(17%) experienced a PR, 9 (50%) had SD, and 6 had disease progression as their best response. The patients who

study. Figure 1 is a waterfall plot highlighting responses
according to disease type and receipt of prior EGFR therapy.
For patients who had received prior anti-EGFR
agents, there was no obvious correlation between the duration of that prior therapy and the duration of cetuximab
and lapatinib therapy (Fig. 2A). There were improvements in PFS for some patients on study compared with
the treatment they received just before study entry (Fig.
2B). For patients whose best response was SD or a PR, the
average ratio of PFS on study/PFS on prior therapy was
1.6 (range, 0.3-4.5). The study by Von Hoff et al identified a ratio of 1.3 as clinically beneficial.15
PK measures

Complete sets of trough PK measures for cycles 1 and 2
were available for the first 5 patients. There were no statistically significant differences in trough lapatinib PK levels
on and off doxycycline treatment (P 5 .81), indicating no
significant drug-drug interaction.
Pharmacogenetic analysis

Figure 1. This is a waterfall plot of the best responses to combined cetuximab and lapatinib by disease type. Patients are
identified according to primary disease as follows: C indicates
colorectal cancer; L, nonsmall cell lung cancer; A, anal carcinoma; and H, head and neck cancer. A circumflex symbol (^)

had PRs had colorectal cancer (n 5 2) and head and neck
cancer (n 5 1), and the duration on study for these
patients was 4 cycles, 12 cycles, and 12 cycles (3 months,
9 months, and 9 months, respectively). The clinical benefit rate (SD 1 PR 1 CR) was 67%. At the highest dose
level (n 5 6), 1 patient had disease progression, 4 patients
had SD, and 1 patient with head and neck cancer had a
PR, for a clinical benefit rate of 83%, indicating a possible
dose-response relation.
Of the 10 patients who were evaluable for response
and had previously received anti-EGFR therapy, 7 experienced clinical benefit (1 PR in a patient with colorectal cancer and SD in 6 patients). The patient with colorectal cancer
had been receiving single-agent cetuximab for 11 months
before progressing and then was enrolled in the current
Cancer

Pharmacogenetic testing results indicated that variations
in FccRIIA correlated with clinical benefit (SD 1 PR vs
progressive disease; P 5 .045) (Table 3). Variation in
CCND1 levels correlated with a higher degree of diarrhea
in patients who had the variant genotype (P 5 .013) and a
trend toward improved clinical benefit (P 5 .07). No variant was correlated with the degree of rash toxicity.
Tumor biopsy analysis

In total, 18 patients underwent successful baseline biopsies,
and pretreatment and post-treatment biopsies were available from 11 patients who also were evaluable for response.
A decrease in phosphoprotein expression of specific proteins in the EGFR pathway appeared to coincide with clinical benefit (Supporting Table 1; see online supporting
information). In terms of disease-specific results, for the 5
patients with nonsmall lung cancer, decreased phosphoprotein expression was observed in those who experienced SD
(patients 15 and 20), whereas increased protein expression
in specific components of the EGFR/ErbB2 and related
pathways occurred in the patients who experienced disease
progression. This included the PI3K (patients 5 and 9),
MET receptor (patients 9 and 13), MAPK (patients 9 and
13), Jak/Stat (patient 13), and insulin-like growth factor
(IGF) protein (patient 13) pathways.
DISCUSSION
In the new era of targeted anticancer agent development
and treatment, the same questions that were asked during

(A) The duration of previous antiepidermal growth factor receptor (antiEGFR) therapy is compared with the duration of treatment on study with cetuximab and lapatinib.

the era of cytotoxic agent development can and should be
asked again. First, can active single agents be combined to
achieve additive or even synergistic efficacy? Second, can
agents with overlapping toxicities be combined safely, and
how can these toxicities best be managed? Third, when
(and not whether) cancer cells develop acquired resistance
to an agent, can that acquired resistance be overcome with
the addition of other agents?
Anti-EGFR agents have proven efficacy in a range of
epithelial solid tumor malignancies, especially in the metastatic setting, either as single therapies or when combined
with cytotoxic agents. The efficacy of combined antiEGFR therapy with cetuximab and erlotinib recently was
established in patients with refractory colon cancer in the
phase 2 DUX trial.17 Conversely, dual anti-EGFR therapy using cetuximab and either erlotinib or gefitinib was
not as effective in patients with nonsmall lung cancer, at
1650

least in the phase 1 setting,18,19 although additive activity
had been observed in preclinical models.20,21 Lapatinib,
as an EGFR inhibitor, would be expected to have similar
efficacy to that observed in the DUX trial when combined
with cetuximab, at least in patients with colorectal cancer.
Our results of a 17% PR rate and a 50% SD rate highlight
the potential benefit from dual anti-EGFR therapy. In
fact, our results are more promising than either singleagent lapatinib or trials that combined lapatinib with
cytotoxic agents in these same cancers.22-26
Toxicities associated with anti-EGFR therapies were
common in our trial, as expected. Greater than 90% of
patients experienced a rash, and >60% experienced diarrhea, although the majority were only grade 1 events. It is
noteworthy that these toxicities were not dose-dependent.
We believe that the aggressive combined antirash treatment we used probably kept that toxicity from being

more significant—and more dose limiting—than it otherwise would have been. This toxicity profile was similar to
that observed when trastuzumab was combined with lapatinib in the phase 1 setting, although, in that trial, the
MTD of lapatinib was only 1000 mg daily.27
We used the cautious and unconventional approach
for a phase 1 trial of monitoring patients for these DLTs
through a total of 2 (rather than 1) 3-week cycles. In the
alternative, we could have had cycles last 6 weeks to
assess this DLT window, but we determined that restaging such refractory patients only every 3 months (or 2
cycles) could be detrimental to their care if the treatment
was not providing benefit. In the end, our approach was
not necessary, because the vast majority of grade 2 or 3
episodes of rash and diarrhea occurred—or at least
began—in the first 3 weeks of therapy. However, some
of our patients did experience mounting fatigue and skin
rash after prolonged treatment. In fact, 4 patients (3 with
SD, 1 with a PR) withdrew consent after receiving treatment for 4, 6, 13, and 14 cycles because of these toxicities. In these patients, the skin rash evolved from
acneform to a more diffuse erythematous, nonblanching
rash that was mainly on the face.
These results highlight the complexity and difficulty
in assessing MTDs and DLTs in phase 1 trials of targeted
therapies28 and in the design of phase 1 combination drug
studies.29 These results also highlight the finding that
effective therapies can become cumulatively taxing, even
in the absence of acute toxicities. Consideration of inteCancer

grating treatment breaks or rest periods could be worthwhile in this scenario.
Our hypothesis in conducting this phase 1 trial was
that combined anti-EGFR and anti-ErbB2 therapy may
be beneficial, especially in treating tumors that have
developed acquired resistance after exposure to antiEGFR therapy with EGFR/ErbB2 receptor heterodimerization and pathway reactivation.3,5-9 Preclinical work
done since the start of our trial by Yonesaka and colleagues confirmed this mechanism of acquired resistance
to cetuximab and demonstrated how combined treatment with lapatinib reversed this resistance.30 We could
not directly test this hypothesis, because antibodies measuring the heterodimer configuration of EGFR/ErbB2
could not be optimized for tumor assessment. However,
our exploratory results in terms of treatment efficacy,
including the average “PFS on study/PFS on prior
therapy” ratio of 1.6 for patients with SD or better, suggest that this treatment strategy may be of benefit and
warrants further testing in the phase 2 setting.
The study of pharmacogenetics attempts to explain
differences in pharmacologic response and toxicity by
germline and/or somatic genetic variations.31 For cetuximab, mutations in the Kras protein—which is downstream from the EGFR receptor—can nullify the benefit
from blocking the receptor, leading to persistent intracellular signaling and cellular growth. Our finding that a
germline SNP in FccRIIA correlates with clinical benefit is
provocative, confirms other findings,32-34 and deserves

additional exploration. The observed impact by this polymorphism is likely because of cetuximab (and not lapatinib) therapy given the drug’s mechanism of action, and it
may indicate different activation of antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity.35
Tissue biopsies revealed decreased phosphoprotein
expression of EGFR/ErbB2-related pathways in patients
who benefited from therapy. Nonresponders had an
increase in the expression of phosphoproteins in 1 or
more EGFR downstream pathways in response to treatment. This included critical members of the PI3K, MET,
MAPK, and Jak/Stat pathways, many of which can be targeted with approved agents or drugs currently in development. Again, how best to identify such patients before
treatment initiation remains the clinical challenge.
In conclusion, the MTD (and recommended phase 2
dose) of this combination is cetuximab 400 of 250 mg/m2
weekly and oral lapatinib 1250 mg daily. Toxicities of rash
and diarrhea were common and manageable, especially with
aggressive antirash supportive care. Clinical benefit was
observed in this small cohort of heavily pretreated patients,
including patients who had previously received anti-EGFR
therapies. Additional clinical trials in solid tumors known to
be driven by the EGF pathway that can be treated with
cetuximab are warranted and are being planned.
