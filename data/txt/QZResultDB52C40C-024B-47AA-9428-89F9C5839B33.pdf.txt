Abstract
KRAS is mutated in about 20-25% of all human cancers and especially in
pancreatic, lung and colorectal tumors. Oncogenic KRAS stimulates several prosurvival pathways, but it also triggers the trans-activation of pro-apoptotic genes.
In our work, we show that G13D mutations of KRAS activate the MAPK pathway,
and ERK2, but not ERK1, up-regulates Noxa basal levels. Accordingly, premalignant
epithelial cells are sensitized to various cytotoxic compounds in a Noxa-dependent
manner. In contrast to these findings, colorectal cancer cell sensitivity to treatment
is independent of KRAS status and Noxa levels are not up-regulated in the presence
of mutated KRAS despite the fact that ERK2 still promotes Noxa expression. We
therefore speculated that other survival pathways are counteracting the pro-apoptotic
effect of mutated KRAS and found that the inhibition of AKT restores sensitivity to
treatment, especially in presence of oncogenic KRAS. In conclusion, our work suggests
that the pharmacological inhibition of the pathways triggered by mutated KRAS could
also switch off its oncogene-activated pro-apoptotic stimulation. On the contrary, the
combination of chemotherapy to inhibitors of specific pro-survival pathways, such as
the one controlled by AKT, could enhance treatment efficacy by exploiting the prodeath stimulation derived by oncogene activation.

Introduction

GTPases are bound to GDP and display low activity,
unable to trigger the down-stream signaling processes.
RAS proteins require GTP to be activated and undergo
rapid cycles of activation and inactivation crucial for
physiological signaling [1]. Because these cascades
stimulate cell growth and division, aberrant RAS signaling

KRAS is a 21 KDa protein involved in cell signal
transduction belonging to the RAS subfamily, which
comprises several other small GTPases endowed with
GTP-hydrolyzing activity. In unstimulated conditions,

can also lead to cancer. The 3 human RAS genes (HRAS,
KRAS, and NRAS) are among the most prevalent drivers
of human cancer, with KRAS being mutated in 20-25%
of all human tumors and up to 90% in certain cancer
types, e.g. pancreatic cancer [2]. In these settings, KRAS
activates several down-stream effectors leading to the
stimulation of the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (RAF/MEK/
ERK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways.
Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most
widespread cancer types, displays in 40% of cases
KRAS activating mutations, primarily involving codon
12 or 13. Several drug combinations are currently used
for CRC treatment, including oxaliplatin, 5-FU and the
camptothecin (CPT) analogue irinotecan [3]. Moreover,
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-blocking
antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab are approved
for treatment of metastatic CRC in combination
with chemotherapy and as maintenance therapy in
chemorefractory tumors. Receptor tyrosine kinases such as
EGFR, through the activation of the downstream GTPases,
regulate MAPK and PI3K pathways. Importantly,
mutations or amplification of KRAS is often associated
to unresponsiveness and acquired resistance to cetuximab
[4].
Even though oncogenic KRAS is often associated
with poorer prognosis, its mutations have also been
considered for targeted therapy taking advantage of
combinations that produce a synthetic lethal effect [5,
6]. In fact, the presence of constitutively active KRAS
sensitizes cancer cells to MEK and BCL-XL [7] or RAF
[8] inhibition, TRAIL [9], 5-FU and oxaliplatin [10].
Nonetheless, KRAS activation is usually associated with
reduced proneness to apoptosis and increased resistance
to chemotherapy owing to the activation of pro-survival
pathways [11-13] and resulting in the up-regulation of
anti-apoptotic factors such as the members of the inhibitor
of apoptosis proteins (IAP) family [14, 15].
IAPs are characterized by the presence of a
conserved baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain [16]
important for protein-protein interactions. Despite the 8
members of the IAP family had initially been considered
essentially apoptosis negative regulators, only X-linked
IAP (XIAP) is known to physically interact with caspases
and prevent their activity [17]. Later studies have shown
that IAPs regulate cell life aspects other than apoptosis.
Cellular IAP1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2, for example, modulate
the signaling of pro-survival pathways, such as the ones
regulated by NF-kB transcription factors and MAPKs
[16]. Interestingly, IAPs are often deregulated in cancer
cells and associated to unfavorable prognosis [18]. An
opportunity to target IAPs, and especially cIAP1, cIAP2
and XIAP, both for therapeutic purposes and as tools in
pre-clinic research is represented by second mitochondriaderived activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetic (SM) small
compounds [19]. SMs were designed to mimic the activity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of SMAC [20], a natural antagonist of XIAP, which, by
interacting with its BIR domains, displaces caspases
and promotes their activity with consequent apoptosis
induction. SMs also target cIAP1 and cIAP2, causing
their degradation [21, 22], modulating several pathways
and overcoming cancer cell resistance to therapy [23]
and especially to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis
inducing ligand (TRAIL) [20, 24].
Here we report that SM83, a SM recently described
by us [25, 26], greatly enhances the cytotoxic activity of
the topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT in premalignant models
in which KRAS G13D is endogenously or ectopically
expressed in human epithelial cells. The increased
sensitivity of oncogenic KRAS-expressing cells stems
at least in part from the basal up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein Noxa, which is stimulated in an ERK2dependent manner. In clear contrast to the premalignant
models, a panel of CRC lines with knock-in (KI) and
knock-out (KO) mutations of KRAS G13D showed that
the sensitivity to treatment is independent of KRAS status.
Accordingly, Noxa levels are unaffected by oncogenic
KRAS expression and other pathways, such as the ones
controlled by PI3K/AKT, protect cancer cells from the
potentially pro-apoptotic stimulus of mutated KRAS.

Results
The combination of SMs and CPT selectively kills
premalignant epithelial cells bearing oncogenic
KRAS
As SMs are rarely effective in monotherapy, but
sensitize cancer cells to other compounds, we searched
for drugs whose cytotoxicity can be efficiently enhanced
by SM83 using a high-throughput cell based screening
approach. HeLa cells were exposed in vitro to SM83
and izTRAIL in addition to a combined library of about
3000 FDA-approved small molecule inhibitors and
cell viability assessed (see Materials and Methods). Of
the 3000 small molecule inhibitors assessed, we found
that the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT)
most profoundly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of SM83
(Table 1). In addition to the enhancing effect of CPT,
we also found that different formulations of CPT such
as 10-hydroxycamptothecin also enhanced the effects of
SM83, further confirming that CPT can be effectively
combined with SMs and TRAIL. We then asked whether
this combination is more cytotoxic in a specific genetic
background and treated a panel of premalignant and
cancer cell lines with izTRAIL, SM83 and CPT alone or in
combination (data not shown). Viability tests showed that
the immortalized human epithelial (HME) cell line bearing
a KI G13D mutation in the KRAS gene (D13/+) is far
more sensitive to SM83 plus CPT treatment compared to

confirming the involvement of KRAS in the enhanced
sensitivity. Unfortunately, the lack of an antibody
specific for mutant KRAS did not allow us to determine
the efficiency of G13D down-regulation (Figure S2).
Furthermore, the silencing also affected wild type KRAS,
which might also have a protective role to the treatment. To
overcome this limit, KRAS G13D was inducibly expressed
in HME cells using doxycycline. Augmented levels of
phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Figure 2B), a down-stream
effector of KRAS, and GST-RBD pull-down experiments
confirmed the increased expression of activated KRAS
(Figure 2C) paralleled by an hypersensitivity to SM83/
CPT co-treatment (Figure 2D). We then repeated the
experiments with another human epithelial cell line to
exclude a possible cell line-specificity of our observation.
MCF10A transduced with the KRAS G13D inducible
vector confirmed that expression of mutant KRAS
causes the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Figure 2E) and
hypersensitivity to cell death (Figure 2F).

the parental HME or to HME carrying mutations activating
PI3K and EGFR (Figure 1A). Moreover, HME D13/+ cells
were more sensitive to izTRAIL alone or in combination
with SM83 (Figure S1 upper panels), to the topoisomerase
II inhibitor etoposide (ETO) and to neocarzinostatin
(NCS), a DNA double strand break inducer (Figure S1
lower panel), suggesting a general enhanced sensitivity
to cell death more than a specific mechanism favoring
CPT-mediated death. Pre-treatment with pan-caspase
inhibitor z-VAD strongly supports the idea that SM83/CPT
treatment kills HME D13/+ cells through an apoptotic
mechanism (Figure 1B left panel). In fact, the blocking
of caspases resulted in almost complete protection from
the treatment, while necroptosis inhibitor Necrostatin-1
(Nec-1) showed only a negligible effect. Importantly,
as TNF is known to be a pivotal player in SM-mediated
cell death, HME D13/+ were also pre-treated with the
TNF-specific blockers Infliximab (Figure 1B middle
panel) and Enbrel (Figure 1B right panel) which both
remarkably rescued cells from the treatment, confirming
the involvement of TNF in the SM83/CPT cell killing.
Finally, by biochemical analysis we further confirmed
that SM83 strongly increases the pro-apoptotic effect of
CPT, as is evident from the substantial accumulation of
cleaved PARP, caspase-8 and -3 (Figure 1C). Importantly,
the altered sensitivity to treatment in cells with wild type
or mutated KRAS did not stem from a diverse expression
of the SM known targets cIAP1, cIAP2 and XIAP (Figure
1D), which are also depleted at the same level by SM83.

Oncogenic KRAS-mediated up-regulation of Noxa
sensitizes cells to SM83/CPT co-treatment
To determine the mechanisms by which oncogenic
KRAS sensitizes non-tumoral cells to treatment, several
cell lines expressing endogenous and ectopic KRAS
G13D were analyzed by western blot for the levels of
pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (data
not shown). In accordance to other works, we found that
the presence of oncogenic KRAS considerably increases
the basal levels of Noxa in untreated cells. Accordingly,
HME bearing the KI G13D mutation displayed higher
levels of Noxa compared to the parental cell line (Figure
3A left panel), while the basal levels of the Noxa natural
antagonist Mcl-1 were not affected by oncogenic KRAS
expression, but markedly dropped after CPT treatment
in a SM83-independent manner. Moreover, transient
induction of ectopic KRAS G13D in HME and MCF10A
parental cell lines concurred to a marked increase of Noxa
levels in both cell lines (Figure 3A right panels, upper and
lower panel respectively). In line with these data, KRAS
silencing reduced the levels of Noxa in HME KRAS G13D
cells (Figure S2). Furthermore, since Mcl1 levels were
reduced concurrently to Noxa up-regulation in HME cells
(Figure 3A left panel), we checked whether Noxa increase
was responsible for Mcl1 down-regulation. Mcl1 levels
were therefore detected in KRAS G13D-induced HME
cells which showed that the sole Noxa up-regulation in not
sufficient to affect Mcl1 levels in untreated cells. We then
analyzed by western blot HME KI D13/+ cells silenced
with control or Noxa-specific siRNAs and treated with
increasing concentrations of CPT (Figure 3B). Also in this
case Mcl-1 stability was independent of Noxa presence,
suggesting that Mcl-1 down-regulation stems from the
treatment and not from Noxa up-regulation. To determine

To further investigate the role of mutated KRAS in
the increased sensitivity of HME, the cytotoxic response
to CPT and SM83 was assessed following total KRAS
knockdown. The results showed that reduced KRAS
decreased the toxicity by about 50% (Figure 2A), thus

whether the oncogenic KRAS-dependent accumulation of
Noxa is responsible for the hypersensitivity to SM83/CPT,
viability tests were performed after Noxa depletion (Figure
S2). The results showed that Noxa silencing confers
resistance to treatment in HME D13/+ cells (Figure 3C).

LY294002 did not affect significantly the toxicity of
SM83/CPT treatment (Figure 4A). In contrast, both
MEK1/2 inhibitors partially protected D13/+ HME cells
from SM83/CPT treatment and conferred resistance at the
same degree as parental cells (Figure 4A). Having found
that Noxa is a pivotal mediator of KRAS-dependent
increased sensitivity to the combination (Figure 3C), we
evaluated whether the MAPK pathway was responsible
for the increased levels of Noxa. We found that both
MEK inhibitors reduced, as expected, the levels of
phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2, and concurrently
reduced the levels of Noxa (Figure 4B). Interestingly,
also Mcl1 levels were slightly reduced by the MEK
inhibitors, suggesting that both Noxa and Mcl1 expression
is regulated by the MEK/ERK pathway. Importantly,
MEK inhibition slightly reduced Noxa basal levels also
in parental HME (left panel) suggesting that the MAPK

KRAS-induced up-regulation of Noxa is mediated
by ERK2
We next investigated the mechanisms responsible
for the acquired sensitivity of KRAS-mutated HME to
treatment. Both parental and D13/+ HME cell lines were
treated with CPT and SM83 in the presence of various
inhibitors of the MAPK, AKT and PI3K pathways which
can be stimulated by activated RAS. In parental cells,

pathway stimulates Noxa also in physiological conditions.
To understand whether MEK targets ERK1 and ERK2 both
contribute to Noxa regulation, we silenced each of them
in D13/+ HME cells and found that only ERK2 downregulation reduced Noxa levels, while ERK1 silencing
marginally increased accumulation of Noxa (Figure 4C
right panel). Again, Mcl1 was not down-regulated by
Noxa accumulation, further confirming that the treatment
with CPT, and not Noxa up-regulation, was responsible for
Mcl1 reduction in HME cells (Figure 3A). In line with the
regulation of Noxa observed in figure 4C, ERK1 silencing
slightly, but significantly, enhanced the sensitivity of
D13/+ HME cells to SM83/CPT treatment, while ERK2

silencing resulted in the opposite effect (Figure 4D).

Sensitivity to SM83/CPT is independent of KRAS
status in a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines
Our findings support the notion that oncogenic
KRAS can sensitize premalignant cells to SM83/CPT
treatment. We then considered whether this also occurs
in malignant cells, and for this reason we employed a
panel of isogenic CRC cell lines where mutated KRAS
is either KI (+/+ and D13/+, SW48 and Lim1215) or KO
(D13/- and +/-, HCT-116 and DLD1). Surprisingly and in

contrast to the premalignant settings, the sensitivity of the
CRC cell lines to SM83/CPT treatment was independent
of the KRAS status (Figure 5A-D). We then investigated
the Noxa status, which was responsible for the increased
sensitivity of normal epithelial cells bearing oncogenic
KRAS, and found that its levels were unaffected by the
presence of mutated KRAS (Figure 5E-H). Likewise, the
levels of Noxa-antagonist Mcl1 were not repressed by the
treatment with CPT and/or SM83, and further experiments
confirmed an increased stability of Mcl1 in colorectal
cancer compared to HME cells (Figure S3). Noxa basal
levels were however higher in CRC than in HME cell lines
(data not shown), suggesting that pro-apoptotic mediators
can even be up-regulated in tumor cells, but there are
likely other activated pathways that counterbalance the
potential pro-apoptotic stimuli.

findings described for HME are true also in this cancer cell
line. In fact, the targeting of ERK1 by silencing enhanced
the levels of Noxa, while a specific siRNA targeting ERK2
slightly reduced its expression (Figure 6F).

Discussion
In our work, we searched for FDA-approved drugs
that increase the cytotoxic activity of IAP-antagonizing
compounds and death ligands. For this purpose, using a
high-throughput approach, we combined SM83 [25] and
izTRAIL [29] to a library of about 3000 compounds.
CPT was identified several times among the best hits
and validated, alone or in combination with SM83 and/
or izTRAIL, in a panel of normal and cancer cell lines
bearing KI and KO mutations in genes frequently mutated
in cancer. The employment of isogenic cell lines with
distinct point mutations is a powerful tool to comprehend
the effect of oncogene activation [31] and addiction [32],
and synthetic lethal interactions [27, 33] in cancer cells.
With this approach, we found that the endogenous and
ectopic expression of KRAS bearing the G13D mutation
sensitizes normal, but not cancer cells, to CPT plus SM83
or TRAIL treatment, and to other DNA-damaging agents.
Since oncogenic KRAS stimulates the up-regulation
of the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa [10, 34], we checked
the occurrence of this event in premalignant cells and
whether it was associated with the increased sensitivity
to treatment. In both human epithelial cells HME and
MCF10A, the expression of oncogenic KRAS was
indeed responsible for the up-regulation of Noxa in a
MEK/ERK-dependent manner and for the augmented
death upon SM83/CPT treatment. Accordingly, chemical
inhibition of the MEK1/2 kinases that results in prevention
of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and silencing of ERK2, but
not ERK1, down-regulated Noxa in HME D13/+ to levels
comparable to parental HME (+/+) cells. Of note, ERK2
silencing slightly, but reproducibly, protected HME D13/+
cells, while ERK1 silencing even sensitized to SM83/CPT
treatment and simultaneously increased Noxa basal levels
especially in CRC cell lines. The observation that ERK1
and ERK2 display opposite effects in regulating Noxa
levels and mediating chemotherapy responsiveness was
also described in hepatocellular carcinoma cells [35]. In
this case, ERK2 knockdown was responsible for increased
Noxa levels after cisplatin treatment. Although we
investigated Noxa basal levels in our experiments, these
contrasting results strongly support that ERK1 and ERK2
mutually regulate each other [36] in a cell type-dependent
manner. Surprisingly, MEK inhibitors strongly prevented
treatment cytotoxicity, while siRNA targeting ERK1
and ERK2 only have a modest effect, despite siERK2
efficiently down-regulated Noxa levels. This suggests that
other unknown regulatory mechanisms between the two
ERK proteins eventually impact on the treatment outcome.
We then asked whether our findings are true not only

Aberrant activation of AKT counterbalances
KRAS-mediated pro-apoptotic scenario in
colorectal cancer cells
Despite the presence of mutant KRAS, our findings
suggest that cancer cells are not sensitized to SM83/CPT
treatment. Therefore, we hypothesized that malignant
progression might have caused the deregulation of other
pathways that can counterbalance the potential apoptotic
effect of oncogenic KRAS. Interestingly, HCT116 and
DLD1 cells bear mutated PI3K, which results in hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, a signaling cascade
known to promote cell survival. For this reason, we treated
HCT116 and DLD1 cells bearing mutated and wild type
KRAS with SM83/CPT after pre-treatment with inhibitors
of MEK1/2, AKT and PI3K. Interestingly, and concordant
to our hypothesis, AKT inhibition restored sensitivity
to the treatment only in the presence of mutant KRAS
(Figure 6A and 6B). Noxa levels were lowered by MAPK
blocking (Figure 6C and 6D) as already observed in HME
cells (Figure 4B), but were not affected by AKT inhibition,
suggesting that the AKT pathway blocks the pro-death
effect triggered by oncogenic KRAS in an independent
fashion. Importantly, AKT inhibition sensitized to
SM83/CPT treatment also CRC cell lines bearing wild
type PI3K (Figure S4), further supporting the idea that
AKT counteracts the pro-death stimulus deriving from
oncogenic KRAS. Surprisingly, LY294002 treatment,
which reduced AKT activation, did not sensitize to SM83/
CPT treatment (Figure 6C and 6D). We speculate that this
stems from the fact that the LY294002 inhibitor did not
completely abolish AKT phosphorylation and therefore
we tested the GDC-0941 PI3K inhibitor. This compound
reduced the AKT activation more efficiently (Figure 6E
left panel) and sensitized the HCT116 D13/- in the same
way as Triciribine (Figure 6E right panel). Finally, we
investigated the mechanisms by which Noxa levels are
controlled in HCT116 cells and demonstrated that the

in premalignant cells, but also in cancer cells. To this end,
a panel of isogenic colon cancer cell lines with KI and KO
mutations of KRAS was tested. In clear contrast to HME
and MCF10A cells, Noxa levels did not depend on KRAS
status in cancer cells and in line with this observation cell
sensitivity was almost identical in each pair of isogenic
cells. Basal levels of Noxa in cancer cells were higher
than in epithelial cells (data not shown), suggesting that
tumor cells constitutively express some pro-apoptotic
proteins at high level, but could also activate parallel
pro-survival pathways to counteract the pro-death signals
supported by the MEK/ERK axis. Considerable evidence
shows that mutations in the RAS/MEK/ERK cascade are
associated to aberrant activation of PI3K/AKT signaling
[37] and therefore both pathways should be targeted
simultaneously for effective responsiveness to treatment
[11, 38]. In accordance to this hypothesis, HCT116 cells
and DLD1, which bear PI3K activating mutations, are
sensitized to SM83/CPT treatment when pre-treated
with AKT inhibitors only in the presence of oncogenic
KRAS, supporting the notion that AKT is protecting from

oncogenic KRAS-dependent cancer cell sensitization
(Figure 7). It is important to note that this protective role
was demonstrated also in cells bearing wild type PI3K
(Figure S4), confirming the general pivotal role of AKT in
counterbalancing the pro-death effect of oncogenic KRAS.
In conclusion, our work has two main implications.
First, targeting down-stream effectors of oncogenes might
result in an immediate and transient anti-proliferative
effect often achieved by conventional therapies, but,
more importantly, could also shut-down the pro-death
signals derived from oncogene activation. Secondly, for
a successful treatment, targeting of the EGFR/MAPK
pathway alone is not sufficient [39], as it results in
emerging protecting mutations [4, 40], feedbacks [41]
and incomplete responses. It is therefore imperative to
characterize and inhibit also the aberrantly activated
survival pathways in a combination treatment, in order
to overcome the anti-apoptotic effect of PI3K/AKT
activation and simultaneously to exploit the pro-death
signal stemming from oncogenic activation.

Figure 7: Proposed mechanism for oncogenic KRAS-mediated sensitization to cell death. In premalignant models, normal
epithelial cells expressing endogenous or ectopic mutated KRAS express high levels of Noxa due to the hyper-activation of MAPK kinases
and in particular of ERK2. In these settings, the basal activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is not sufficient to protect from this pro-death
stimulus and treatment with several cytotoxic agents results in Noxa-dependent cell killing. In contrast, in CRC cells, Noxa levels are
independent of KRAS status and oncogenic KRAS-bearing cells respond to treatment to the same extent as in the presence of wild-type
KRAS. In fact, mutated PI3K and up-stream stimuli likely deriving from the tyrosine kinase receptors activate AKT, which counterbalances
the potential pro-death stimulus deriving from oncogenic KRAS.

Methods

High-throughput screening
On day 1, 350 HeLa cells/well were seeded in
384-well white plates in 20 µl medium. At day 2, media
was changed with cells being exposed to 100 nM SM83
in addition to FDA-approved drug libraries (ENZO
Life Sciences, MicroSource Discovery Systems Inc.
and Prestwick Chemical, France) with the drug library
compounds present at a final concentration of 1 µM. At
day 3, cells exposed to SM83 were also exposed to 20
pg/ml izTRAIL. Cell viability was estimated on day 5 by
CellTiter-Glo (Promega). Hits were selected due to their
capability to enhance the cytotoxic activity of SM83/
izTRAIL and then validated using the same HeLa cells
employed in the screening. In validation experiments,
SM83 and izTRAIL were administered alone and in
combination, also changing the schedule and pre-treating
cells with SM83 24 h before izTRAIL or administrating
these compounds simultaneously. On the basis of
these results, validated hits were tested in a panel of
premalignant and cancer cell lines.

Cell lines
The human isogenic hTERT-immortalized mammary
epithelial cell lines HME +/+ and HME D13/+, and the
human epithelial mammary MCF10A together with the
isogenic pairs of colorectal cancer cell lines SW48 +/+ and
SW48 D13/+, HCT116 +/- and HCT116 D13/-, Lim1215
+/+ and Lim1215 D13/+, DLD1 D13/- and DLD1 +/- have
already been described [4, 27]. HME isogenic pairs and
MCF10A cell lines were cultured in DMEM-F12 (Gibco),
supplemented with 10% FBS (LONZA), 2 mM glutamine
(LONZA), 20 ng/ml EGF (Immunological Science), 10
µg/ml insulin (Sigma), 500 µg/ml hydrocortisone (SigmaAldrich). SW48 and DLD1 isogenic pairs were cultured
with DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and
2 mM glutamine. Lim1215 isogenic pairs were cultured
with RPMI (LONZA) supplemented with 10% FBS,
2 mM glutamine and 1 µg/ml insulin. HCT116 were
cultured in RPMI, supplemented with 2 mM glutamine,
sodium pyruvate (LONZA), and non-essential amino acids
(LONZA). HeLa cells for the high-throughput screening
and packaging HEK293FT (Life Technologies) for
lentiviral production were cultured in DMEM with 10%
FBS. All cell lines were mycoplasma-free as determined
by Takara Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Clontech).

Western blot
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500
rpm for 5 min at 4°C. After washing once with PBS,
lysates were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in
60-100 µl lysis buffer (125 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8, 5 %
SDS) supplemented with 1x complete protease (Roche
Diagnostics) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich).
Lysates were boiled at 99°C, sonicated for 20 seconds at
RT. Then lysates were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 20
min at RT and cleared supernatants were transferred into
a new tube and frozen at -20°C. Cell lysates were mixed
with 4x reducing SDS-Sample buffer containing 10%
β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and heated for 10
min at 99°C. Proteins (50 µg) were separated by SDSPAGE using pre-cast 4-12% BisTris NuPAGE gels (Life
Technologies), blotted to PVDF membranes (Millipore),
which were washed with PBS-tween for 5 min, blocking
buffer made of 4% non-fat milk in PBS-tween for 30 min
and then incubated overnight with the indicated primary
antibodies. Proteins were detected after hybridization
with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated
secondary antibodies by adding a chemiluminescent
substrate (EuroClone).

Reagents
Antibodies targeting pan-RAS, Noxa (CalBiochem),
Actin and ERK1/2 (Sigma), cleaved-PARP, cleaved
caspase-3, phosphoERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), pAKT and
AKT (Cell Signaling), cIAP1 (R&D Systems), cIAP2 and
XIAP (BD Biosciences), caspase-8 (Enzo Life Sciences)
and Mcl-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were employed
in western blot experiments. z-VAD(OMe)-FMK was
purchased by BIOMOL, Necrostatin-1 from Enzo Life
Sciences. PD98059 and UO126 were purchased from
CalBiochem, LY294002 from Sigma, GDC-0941 and
Triciribine from Selleckem. Infliximab (Schering-Plough)
and Enbrel (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) were used as TNF
blockers. CPT and neocarzinostatin were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, etoposide by Teva. SM83 synthesis has
been described elsewhere [25, 28], while izTRAIL was
purified as already shown [29]. Mutant KRAS (G13D)
was cloned in the pINDUCER20 and lentiviral particles
prepared modifying an already described protocol [30]
and using Lipofectamine 2000 as transfection reagent.
Expression of the transgene was induced by doxycycline
(Sigma-Aldrich) at the indicated concentrations.

Cell viability assays
96-well optical bottom, polymer base white plates
(Thermo Scientific) were used for viability tests. At day
1, 10000 cells per well were seeded in 100 µl medium.
At day 2, cells were treated adding the indicated drug(s)
in 10 µl volume per well. At day 3, cell viability was

determined using the CellTiter-Glo assay according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical analysis was
performed with GraphPad Prism 5.02 using the two-tailed
unpaired t-test.

Transfection and lentiviral transduction
To achieve transient knock-down of target proteins
in HME cells, a reverse transfection protocol employing
siRNAs (Qiagen) and RNAiMAX (Life technologies) was
used. Briefly, 3.25 µl RNAiMAX and 200 µl Optimem
(GIBCO) were mixed and incubated for 5 min at RT.
Subsequently, 3.25 µl siRNA of a 20 µM stock were
added, mixed and incubated for further 30 min at RT. The
transfection mix was placed in a 6-well plate and 0.15 x
106 cells seeded in 800 µl on top.
Tumor cells were seeded the day before transfection
and the same transfection mix as for reverse transfection
was added on top of cells 24 h later. The cells were then
incubated for 48 h before being drug-treated for further 24
h or cultured for 72 h before stopping the experiment. In
each experiment, scramble siRNAs (siCtr) were used as
a control.
Cells transduced with lentiviral particles
were cultured in the presence of medium collected
from HEK293FT packaging cells transfected with
pINDUCER20-KRAS G13D (referred to as G13D) or
empty vector (Mock). After 48 h, medium was replaced
and fresh medium added in the presence of 500 µg/ml
G418 (Life Technologies).

2.5 x 106 cells were seeded into 10 cm dishes. The
next day, cells were incubated with and without 250
ng/ml of Dox. Cell lysis and RAS-GTP pulldown was
performed. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of IP-lysis buffer
supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors. To
fully detach lysed cells, they were scratched using a cell
scraper and transferred into tubes for a 30-minute lysis
at 4 °C on a rotator. Lysates were centrifuged at 13000
rpm for 30 min and cleared supernatants were transferred
to a new tube. RAS-GTP was precipitated using beads
coated with the RAF1-binding domain RBD recombinant
protein. The following day, beads were washed 5 times
with IP-lysis buffer and precipitated protein complexes
were eluted from the beads via boiling in SDS-Sample
buffer for 10 minutes at 80°C. Proteins were separated by
SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot. As a loading
control, proteins were stained by blue coomassie (Thermo
Scientific Pierce).
