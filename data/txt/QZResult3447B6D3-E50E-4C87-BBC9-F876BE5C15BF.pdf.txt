Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Chromosomal translocations are a hallmark of leukemia/lymphoma and also appear in solid tumors,
but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. By establishing a cellular model that mimics the
relative frequency of authentic translocation events without proliferation selection, we report
mechanisms of nuclear receptor-dependent tumor translocations. Intronic binding of liganded-AR
first juxtaposes translocation loci by triggering intra- and interchromosomal interactions. AR then
promotes site-specific DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at translocation loci by recruiting two
types of enzymatic machinery induced by genotoxic stress and liganded-AR, including ActivationInduced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) and the LINE-1 repeat-encoded ORF2 endonuclease. These
enzymatic machineries synergistically generate site-selective DSBs at juxtaposed translocation loci
that are ligated by Non-Homologous Ending Joining (NHEJ) pathway for specific translocations.
Our data suggest that the confluence of two parallel pathways initiated by liganded-nuclear receptor
and genotoxic stress underlie non-random tumor translocations, which may function in many types
of tumors and pathological processes.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Chromosomal translocations, caused by rearrangement of non-homologous chromosomes
(Aplan, 2006), have been well described in leukemia and lymphomas (Greaves and Wiemels,
2003), but their occurrence in solid tumors is increasingly recognized, particularly in prostate
cancer (Tomlins et al., 2005). It has been recognized that prevalent tumor translocations may
be responsible for certain aggressive behaviors of prostate cancer (Wang et al., 2006).
Androgen and its derivatives, which act via the androgen receptor (AR), are not only essential
for development of the prostate gland, but also instrumental to prostate carcinogenesis
(Heinlein and Chang, 2004). Recently, some high frequency gene fusion events have been
discovered in prostate cancers, which involve translocation of the 5′ untranslated region of the
AR target gene TMPRSS2 to two members of the ETS family of genes ERG and ETV1 (Tomlins
et al., 2005). These gene fusion events, which may be present in 50-70% of prostate cancers,
render specific members of the ETS family of genes under the control of androgens; such
acquired androgen-dependent expression or overexpression of the ETS genes has been
proposed to provide a key driving force to the development or aggressiveness of prostate
cancers (Shaffer and Pandolfi, 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While the linkage between chromosomal translocations and various forms of cancer has
founded the theoretical grounds for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics, particularly for leukemia
and lymphomas (Corral et al., 1996; Krivtsov and Armstrong, 2007), the underlying molecular
mechanisms have remained incompletely understood. Although it is well established that
transcriptionally active regions, such as promoters, can be particularly susceptible to DNA
damage (Aguilera and Gomez-Gonzalez, 2008; Thomas and Rothstein, 1989), a prevalent view
has been that tumor translocations may initially result from random chromosome
rearrangement events, which are ultimately selected based on the proliferative and/or antiapoptotic advantage provided by specific fusion gene products. However, precedents such as
Gross Chromosomal Rearrangements (GCR) in yeast (Myung et al., 2001), V(D)J
recombination, and Class Switch Recombination (CSR) during T and B cell development
(Chaudhuri and Alt, 2004) argue for a role of genetically-based and cell lineage-specific
juxtaposition of translocation loci, which may facilitate specific chromosomal translocations
(Jhunjhunwala et al., 2008; Neves et al., 1999; Nikiforova et al., 2000; Roix et al., 2003).
Because many types of cancer occur in tissues in which specific transcription factors may exert
critical roles in tumor development, a potential mechanistic relationship between regulated
transcription and the strategies that underlie tumor translocations, if any, remain an intriguing
question.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here, we present evidence that tumor translocations involving TMPRSS2, ERG and ETV1 in
prostate cancer are non-random events, which require two critical roles of AR: (i) liganddependent binding of AR to intronic binding sites near the tumor translocation sites, causing
chromosomal movements that result in specific intra- and interchromosomal interactions to
create the spatial proximity for tumor translocation partners, and (ii) the actions of intron-bound
AR to both alter local chromatin architecture and recruit the ligand and genotoxic stressinduced enzymes, including the Activation-Induced cytidine Deaminase (AID) and LINE-1
repeat-encoded ORF2 endonuclease to these specific regions for facilitating DNA doublestranded breaks (DSBs) generation. The generated DSBs are subsequently ligated by the NonHomologous End Joining (NHEJ) machinery. These findings elucidate several unexpected
general principles for non-random chromosomal translocations in tumors.

Androgens and Genotoxic Stress Synergistically Induce Prostate Cancer-Specific
Chromosomal Translocations
Based on the critical roles of AR in prostate development and tumor progression, and the
observation that genotoxic stress is able to rapidly induce chromosomal translocations
(Deininger et al., 1998), we first investigated whether androgen treatment and genotoxic stress,
either alone or in combination, might induce chromosomal translocations of TMPRSS2:ERG
and TMPRSS2:ETV1. To establish a cellular model, we utilized androgen-responsive LNCaP
prostate cancer cells in which these chromosomal translocations had not occurred (Tomlins et
al., 2005).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Surprisingly, the treatment of LNCaP cells with both DHT (10−7 M) and irradiation (IR) (50
Gy) dramatically induced both TMPRSS2:ERGb and TMPRSS2:ETV1b fusion transcripts in
24hr, with similar effects reproducibly observed at lowered levels of DHT (10−9 M) and IR
(10 Gy). (Figures 1A and 1B and data not shown). Sequencing of induced fusion transcripts
confirmed that they represented the authentic translocation fusion junctions (Figures 1A and
1B). The cell viability did not differ significantly after 24hr treatment. Actin expression was
equivalent among samples (Figure S1). Other modalities that cause genotoxic stress, including
Etoposide and Doxorubicin, when combined with the DHT treatment, also induced tumor
translocation (Figures S3A and S3B).
To quantitate the frequency at which each type of fusion transcript was formed, 48 individual
sets of cells were exposed (24hr) to either DHT alone, IR alone, or both. RT-PCR analyses of
TMPRSS2:ERGb and TMPRSS2:ETV1b fusion transcripts revealed that either treatment gave
rise to a reproducible, but minimal, induction of the fusion transcripts, but the combined
treatment exhibited an unequivocal, striking synergy (Figures 1C and 1D). The frequency of
these chromosomal translocations in LNCaP cells was estimated by dilution experiments to be
~1 event/10,000 cells (vide infra).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The finding that eight isoforms of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts have been identified in
prostate cancer (Wang et al., 2006) led us to detect all potential induced fusion isoforms using
primers targeting the first exon of TMPRSS2 and the last exon of ERG or ETV1, respectively
(Figures 1E and 1F). This analysis revealed that the frequency of each induced
TMPRSS2:ERG fusion isoform in LNCaP cells was very similar to that identified in prostate
cancer tissues (Wang et al., 2006) (Figures 1E and S2). Together these data demonstrated that
our cellular model and treatment conditions authentically recapitulate the in vivo chromosomal
translocation events, and surprisingly, these specific patterns are established without
proliferation selection.
To determine whether the generation of chromosomal translocation has cell type specificity,
we analyzed IR-induced BCR:ABL1 translocation in KG-1 cells (Deininger et al., 1998) (Figure
S4A) and LNCaP cells. Although BCR and ABL1 are expressed in LNCaP cells at a detectable
level (Figures S4B and S4C), IR (50 Gy) induced BCR:ABL1 fusion in KG-1 cells at an
efficiency ~8-fold higher than that in LNCaP cells (Figure S4D). Conversely, irradiation of
LNCaP cells induced TMPRSS2:ERGb or TMPRSS2:ETV1b fusion >10 fold more efficiently
than in KG-1 cells under the same conditions (Figures S4E and S4F). These observations
demonstrated that general genotoxic stress signals preferentially induce gene fusions in a nonrandom, cell type-specific fashion.
Using validated siRNAs to target specific components of the Homologous Recombination
(HR), NHEJ, or Microhomology-Mediated End Joining (MMEJ) pathways (Figure S8A), we
found that knockdown of individual components of the NHEJ pathway generally attenuated

the induction of both TMPRSS2:ERGb and TMPRSS2:ETV1b fusion transcripts, suggesting
the error-prone NHEJ as the major repair mechanism to generate fusion genes (Figure 1G).
Removal of the major components of the HR pathway actually enhanced the induction of
TMPRSS2:ERGb translocations (Figure 1H). Knockdown of individual components of several
other DNA damage repair pathways did not show any significant effect on the chromosomal
translocation types we tested (Figure S5 and data not shown).
Liganded-AR Induces Intra- and Interchromosomal Interactions Required for Translocations
Based on the dynamic re-organization of chromosomes during development or in response to
specific signals (Cremer et al., 2006), we investigated whether one role of AR might be to
mediate androgen-dependent spatial proximity of the corresponding chromosomal
translocating regions. ERG and TMPRSS2 are both located on Chromosome 21 (Chr21), ~3
megabases apart, while the ETV1 gene is located on Chromosome 7 (Chr7). As TMPRSS2 is
a well-established direct AR target gene (Lucas et al., 2008), we tested whether DHT induced
specific intra- and interchromosomal interactions between these regions.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To avoid potential complications associated with aneuploidy of cancer cells, we focused on
normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC). While TMPRSS2 and ERG genes were independently
localized in the nuclei of mock-treated PrEC cells, DHT stimulation (1hr) induced the apparent
colocalization of these two genes in ~25% of cells, about half exhibiting mono-allelic
interactions and the other half bi-allelic interactions as revealed by FISH analysis (Figure 2A).
We performed a similar analysis for the TMPRSS2 and ETV1 genes in PrEC cells, which
exhibited DHT-induced colocalization in ~10-15% of cells, the majority being mono-allelic
interactions (Figure 2B). We observed similar induced colocalization in LNCaP cells (Figure
S6A and S6B). In contrast, the BCR and ABL1 gene loci did not show any DHT-dependent
colocalization, suggesting the specificity of DHT-dependent chromosomal interactions (Figure
S6C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Based on the reported role of nuclear actin in transcriptional activation (Hofmann and de
Lanerolle, 2006), we examined whether a nuclear myosin I (NMI)/actin-dependent mechanism
might be involved in mediating intra- and interchromosomal interactions in PrEC cells, as
recently documented for breast epithelial cells (Hu et al., 2008). Treatment of DHT-stimulated
PrEC cells with Jasplakinolide (Jpk), which specifically inhibits depolymerization of actin
networks (Holzinger, 2001), caused almost a complete loss of DHT-induced interchromosomal
(TMPRSS2:ETV1) interactions, but did not affect intrachromosomal (TMPRSS2:ERG)
interactions (Figures 2C and 2D). Likewise, single-cell nuclear microinjection of siRNA that
specifically targeted NMI (Grummt, 2006) had little effect on intrachromosomal
(TMPRSS2:ERG) interactions, but caused a complete loss of the DHT-induced
TMPRSS2:ETV1 interchromosomal interactions (Figures 2E and 2F). Similar results were
also obtained by single-cell nuclear microinjection of a neutralizing antibody against NMI,
which could be functionally rescued by co-injecting a plasmid expressing wild-type NMI, but
not mutant NMI that fails to bind to ATP (Wang et al., 2003)(Figures 2G and S7). LNCaP cells
treated with Latrunculin (LtA), which blocks actin polymerization (Rizk and Walczak, 2005),
or Jpk exhibited inhibition of induced TMPRSS2:ETV1 translocations, as was observed using
an siRNA that specifically targeted NMI (Figures 2H and 2I). Together, these observations
reveal the mechanistic link between ligand-induced, nuclear myosin/actin motor systemdependent interchromosomal proximity and tumor translocations.
Mapping TMPRSS2:ERG and TMPRSS2:ETV1 Translocation Breakpoints
To identify the potential DSBs in the corresponding introns of the two translocation partners,
we adapted a protocol of BrdU labeling by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT) (Ju et
al., 2006) coupled with ChIP-seq analysis to detect potential DNA breaks in response to DHT,

genotoxic stress, or both. To test the potential efficacy of this protocol for high-throughput
screening experiments, we took advantage of the inducible 4-OHT-I-PpoI systems to generate
specific cleavage sites on Chromosome 1 (Berkovich et al., 2008) and labeled these sites with
BrdU. Indeed, anti-BrdU ChIP assay showed that after induction with 4-OHT, both the 5′ and
3′ chromatin fragments at the cleavage site, but not the flanking region, could be labeled by
BrdU (Figure S9). By applying this protocol to LNCaP cells, our data revealed one potential
breakpoint located within or nearby intron 1 of the TMPRSS2 gene (Region I), two potential
breakpoints located within intron 3 of ERG gene (Regions II and III), and one potential
breakpoint in the ETV1 gene intron 3 (Region IV) (Figure 3A). Compared to mock treatment,
DHT induced an ~ 6-10-fold change at each of these putative DSBs (Figure 3B). These putative
sites were further confirmed by conventional ChIP analysis, in DHT or DHT+IR treated LNCaP
cells (Figures 3C and 3D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As illustrated in Figure 3A, amplification with primer pairs flanking Region II and I resulted
in a single PCR product (Figure 3E, band a) containing a breakpoint between nucleotides
Chr21: 38819940-38819946 on ERG gene and nucleotide Chr21: 41792689-41792695 on
TMPRSS2 gene (Figure 3E), which confirms that the DNA breaks identified in these pilot
experiments corresponded to actual translocation breakpoints in these genes. Taking advantage
of a finding that simultaneous cotransfection of FLAG-DOT1L (encoding an H3K79
methyltransferase) expression plasmid and MeCP2 siRNA into LNCaP cells resulted in a 60fold induction of fusion transcript (Figure S10), we amplified two additional PCR products
(Figure 3F, band b and c) using primer pair flanking Region III and I, finding that band b
contains breakpoints between Chr21: 38840448-38840454 and Chr21: 41792689-41792695,
and band c contains breakpoints between Chr21: 38840754-38840760 and Chr21:
41792689-41792695 (Figure 3F). Interestingly, both ERG and TMPRSS2 utilize a common
motif (TGT/AGGGA/T) for break/ligation (Figure 3H).
For TMPRSS2:ETV1 translocation, two breakpoints between Chr7: 13991147-13991153 or
Chr7: 13991182-13991188 and Chr21: 41798889-41798895 were revealed by sequencing
PCR product d (Figure 3G, middle panel), containing a common CCAGG/CAA motif as their
break/ligation sites (Figure 3I). An additional breakpoint between ETV1 and TMPRSS2 at Chr7:
13991254 and Chr21: 41791805 were identified from PCR product e (Figure 3G, lower panel).
Together, these mapping results identified unique heptad repeats serving as breakpoints for
non-random ligation sites of tumor translocation.
Sensitization of Intronic AR Binding Sites to Genotoxic Stress

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since AR agonists induced both intra- and interchromosomal movements that involved the AR
target gene TMPRSS2, we hypothesized that the ERG gene might also harbor some previously
unsuspected AR binding sites, even though ERG expression is not induced by AR agonists
(Tomlins et al., 2005). Because the identified “break” sites in ERG and TMPRSS2 are adjacent
to potential Androgen Response Elements (AREs) or ARE half sites (Figure 4A, upper panel),
we conducted conventional ChIP analysis for AR recruitment across the intronic translocation
regions within the ERG and TMPRSS2 genes. As controls, we observed the binding of AR to
PSA promoter and to the recently identified ARE located 13.5kb upstream of the TMPRSS2
gene (ARE V) (Wang et al., 2007), but no significant binding to either an AR negative binding
region in the TMPRSS2 gene (ARE III) (Wang et al., 2007) or the GAPDH exon8 region (Figure
4A). Interestingly, upon DHT treatment, we found that AR was clearly recruited to the ERG
“break” site Region A (corresponding to Region II in Figure 3A), C and D (corresponding to
Region III in Figure 3A), TMPRSS2 “break” site Region F (corresponding to Region I in Figure
3A) and ETV1 “break” site Region H (corresponding to Region IV in Figure 3A) with temporal
kinetics similar to these observed at known positive AR binding sites (PSA promoter and
TMPRSS2 ARE V) (Figures 4A and S15A). AR was also recruited to a potential ARE (Region

G) 2.5 kb upstream of the TMPRSS2 “break” site (Figure 4A). In contrast, the ERG Region B
and the TMPRSS2 Region E, neither of which harbor any apparent ARE nor serve as break
sites, showed no significant AR recruitment (Figure 4A).
To understand the synergistic effect of liganded-AR and genotoxic stress on chromosomal
translocation, we first examined the DNA damage response marked by γH2AX in DHT-, IRor DHT+IR-treated LNCaP cells. No significant enrichment of γH2AX were detected at all
the regions we tested with DHT alone; and a moderate recruitment was observed upon IR
treatment alone with characteristic spreading to regions adjacent to DSBs. Surprisingly, there
was a striking enrichment of γH2AX to the translocation regions (ERG Region A, C, D, the
TMPRSS2 Region F and the ETV1 Region H) after combined treatment with DHT+IR (Figures
S11 and S15B). Since Ku80 protein binds to DNA DSBs, nicks, gaps and hairpins in a
sequence-independent manner and serves as a key component of the NHEJ repair machinery
(Critchlow and Jackson, 1998), we next applied Ku80 as a mark to validate site-specific DSBs
at translocation regions. Consistently, we observed that Ku80 bound to the TMPRSS2 and
ERG intronic AR binding sites exclusively under the condition of combined treatment with
DHT and IR, but not to control regions within the ERG gene (Figures 4B-4D). These results
demonstrated a site-specific sensitization of AR-bound intronic sites to genotoxic stressinduced DSBs.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because binding of nuclear receptors during transcriptional activation is characteristically
accompanied by covalent histone modifications that mark structural changes of chromatin
(Metivier et al., 2006), we next tested whether intronic AR binding causes histone
modifications that facilitate sensitization of these regions to genotoxic stress. Enhanced H3K79
methylation, a mark of altered chromatin structure (Huyen et al., 2004) has been observed to
correlate with V(D)J recombination in B cells (Ng et al., 2003). Histone H4K16 acetylation is
also considered as a mark for chromatin relaxation (Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006) and is involved
in DNA repair. We observed that DHT+IR provoked robust accumulation of di-methyl H3K79
and H4K16 acetylation markers in the ERG regions A, C, D and the TMPRSS2 site F (Figures
S12A and S12B). TMPRSS2 ARE III and GAPDH exon 8 regions, at which no breaks occurred,
provided negative controls. These data provide evidence that the androgen receptor acts to
cause regional histone modifications at the intronic translocation sites.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As a 3′-5′ DNA helicase in yeast is required for GCR by enhancing binding of the replication
protein A (RPA) (Banerjee et al., 2008), we tested whether binding of AR might induce the
recruitment of RPA, which is known to bind to and stabilize single-stranded non-template DNA
(Bochkarev and Bochkareva, 2004) by performing RPA ChIP analysis. Upon DHT stimulation
for 1hr, RPA was rapidly recruited to the AR binding sites, persisting even after 16hr of DHT
stimulation (Figure 4E). Consistent with a key role for RPA in yeast GCR, treatment of LNCaP
cells with RPA2 siRNA inhibited both intra- and interchromosomal translocations induced by
DHT+IR (Figure 4F).
Genotoxic Stress-Induced Enzymatic Machinery Contributes to Chromosomal Breaks at
Intronic AR Binding Sites
Although irradiation may cause random DSBs in the genome, we next investigate the roles of
irradiation in generating site-specific DSBs at translocation regions. Recently, Gadd45, which
is a well-known irradiation-induced protein, was shown to play an important role in mediating
AID actions by forming a functional complex with AID (Rai et al., 2008). Gadd45 is also
known to function as a transcriptional co-activator for a number of nuclear receptors (Yi et al.,
2000). Normally, AID is expressed at a very low level in LNCaP cells; however, we observed
that AR agonists and genotoxic stress both induced AID expression by ~3-fold and >60-fold,
respectively (Figures 5A and 5B). Correspondingly, the AID protein was highly induced in
IR-treated cells as early as 4hr (Figure 5C).

We therefore tested the potential roles of DHT-dependent recruitment of AID/Gadd45 to AR,
observing that AR interacted with both AID and Gadd45 upon DHT+IR treatment (Figure 5D).
This interaction was DHT-dependent, because IR alone did not induce such interactions (Figure
S13). These data suggested that the DHT- and IR-induced AID might be recruited to the intronic
translocation sites via direct binding of the Gadd45/AID complex to liganded-AR. Indeed,
ChIP analysis of anti-Myc-tagged AID (Figure S14A) revealed that AID was recruited to the
intronic AR-binding sites on ERG, TMPRSS2 and ETV1 translocation regions, as well as to
known AR targets such as PSA promoter and TMPRSS2 enhancer, but not to non-AR binding
sites (Figures 5E and S15C). To further confirm a functional role for AID and Gadd45 in AR
dependent tumor translocations, we treated LNCaP cells with either DHT or Bicalutamide
(Casodex, CDX) and observed only minimal recruitment of AID or Gadd45 to intronic AR
binding sites in CDX-treated cells (Figures 5F and 5G).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because AID mediates CSR and Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) by initiating deamination of
bases of single-stranded non-template DNA during transcription (Chaudhuri et al., 2003), we
investigated whether recruitment of AID is essential for the generation of DSBs by monitoring
the enrichment of Ku80 at the translocation regions under the condition of AID knockdown by
siRNA (Figure S8B). Knockdown of AID resulted in a dramatic decrease in the Ku80
enrichment as shown by ChIP analysis (Figure 5H), indicating an inhibition of DSBs generation
in these translocation regions. To further validate this finding, we also used the BrdU/TdT
assay to confirm that DSBs generated at these intronic sites are mediated by AID (Figure 5I).
Consistent with these observations, siRNA knockdown of AID blocked the induction of both
intra- and interchromosomal translocations (Figures 5J). The actual frequency of chromosomal
translocation events was quantitated by PCR analysis in serial dilution experiments, finding
that the rate of translocation induced by DHT+IR within 24hr fell from ~12×10−5 in control
siRNA samples to ~3×10−5 in AID siRNA knockdown samples (Figure 5K).
One hallmark of AID enzymatic activity is the induction of SHM (Honjo et al., 2002). PCR
amplification and sequencing of the break region (ERG region A) following DHT+IR treatment
revealed evidence of the C to U and G to A mutations characteristic of SHM (Figure 6A). These
mutations were inhibited by knockdown of AID prior to the treatment, suggesting that AID is
actively involved in the observed DSB generation at translocations sites. In adjacent control
regions (ERG region B), only basal mutation rate was observed (Figure 6A). To examine the
possibility that AID may also play an obligatory role in mediating AR-induced chromosomal
movements, AID knockdown was performed in PrEC and LNCaP cells, finding that AID did
not exert any effects on DHT-dependent interchromosomal movement, as revealed by FISH
analysis (Figure S16).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We also observed that the Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UNG), which recognizes the U•G
mismatch generated upon deamination of cytidine by AID and generate abasic sites in the
C1 regions during CSR (Rajewsky and von Boehmer, 2008) localized to both ERG and
TMPRSS2 intronic AR binding sites in DHT+IR-treated LNCaP cells (Figure 6B). The
recruitment of UNG was dependent on AID, indicated by reduced UNG recruitment following
the knockdown of AID (Figure 6C).
To determine whether AID also plays a role in SLC45A3:ETV1 chromosomal translocation
identified in prostate cancer (Tomlins et al., 2007), we assessed these translocation events in
DHT+IR-treated LNCaP cells following AID knockdown by specific siRNAs. With combined
treatment of DHT and IR, we detected significant induction of SLC45A3:ETV1 translocation
in LNCaP cells, but not in PrEC cells, even though the expression of SLC45A3 was similarly
induced by DHT between these two cell lines (Figures S20 A-C). However, knockdown of
AID abolished the induced SLC45A3:ETV1 translocation (Figure S20D). Similarly, in B cell
leukemia KG-1 cell line, the BCR:ABL1 translocation is induced by high-dose irradiation, and

knockdown of AID caused a decrease in irradiation-induced BCR:ABL1 translocation (Figures
S8D, S17A and S17B), consistent with the previous report that AID is required for cMyc:IgH translocation (Robbiani et al., 2008). While these findings strongly implicate the
actions of AID to facilitate the DNA breaks at the intronic AR binding sites, they also raised
the question whether other key enzymatic machinery was combinatorially required for induced
chromosomal breaks.
Contribution of PIWI-Regulated LINE-1 Repeat/ ORF2 Endonuclease to Tumor
Translocations
Intriguingly, DHT+IR was much less effective in inducing chromosomal translocations in
PrEC cells than in LNCaP cells (Figures 6D, 6E and Figure S20B), even though the expression
of the TMPRSS2 and SLC45A3 genes were induced similarly by DHT in both cell types
(Figures S18 and S20C). This observation is consistent with the possibility that cancer cells
express additional factors that predispose to genome instability (Peng and Karpen, 2008). We
therefore surveyed the mRNA expression levels of a series of “epigenetic” modulators that
have been implicated in genome instability (Goldberg et al., 2007). Whereas the expression of
most of these modulators did not change, a few (e.g. MOF1) did exhibit ~2-3-fold higher
expression level in PrEC cells compared to LNCaP cells (data not shown), and MOF knockdown noticeably enhanced the efficiency of both intra- and interchromosomal translocations
(Figure S19).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Strikingly, the most dramatic discrepant target we tested between LNCaP and PrEC cells was
PIWIL1 (~9-10 fold) (Figure 6F). PIWIs have been reported to suppress retrotransposition,
including LINE-1 element during spermatogenesis (Aravin et al., 2007), but more recent
studies have also implicated its role in somatic organs (Malone et al., 2009). Treatment of PrEC
cells with PIWIL1 siRNA caused induction of LINE-1 ORF2 expression (Figures 6G and
S8C). This finding raised the possibility that PIWIs might serve as an unexpected but key
component of machinery that silences the expression of the LINE-1 encoded ORF2 in normal
prostate epithelial cells. Indeed, knockdown of PIWIL1 enhanced the enrichment of γH2AX
at ERG and TMPRSS2 intronic translocation regions in PrEC cells (Figure 6H). Despite its
already low levels in LNCaP cells, further knockdown of PIWIL1 elevated the DHT+IRinduced intra- and interchromosomal translocations (Figure 6I), whereas overexpression of
PIWIs in LNCaP cells largely inhibited the induced chromosomal translocations (Figure 6J).
Serial dilution experiment confirmed that the actual translocation frequency rose to
~39×10−5 in LNCaP cell following PIWIL1 knockdown (Figure 6K).

A series of observations including the close relationship between LINE-1 element and genome
instability (Prak and Haoudi, 2006), the potent endonuclease activity of LINE-1-encoded ORF2
(Goodier et al., 2004), and the activation of LINE-1 retrotransposition by irradiation (Farkash
et al., 2006), led us to address the possibility that expression of the LINE-1-encoded ORF2
endonuclease might itself exert a direct role in tumor translocation. Indeed, the relative level
of LINE-1 ORF2 transcripts exhibited a significant (~6-fold) increase in LNCaP cells
compared to PrEC cells, and ORF2 expression was robustly induced by genotoxic stress
(Figures 7A and 7B). These data suggested that ORF2 might function as an additional
irradiation/genotoxic stress-induced enzymatic machinery to mediate the chromosomal breaks
involved in tumor translocations.
Consistent with this possibility, exogenous overexpression of LINE-1 ORF2 (Figure S14B)
was sufficient to cause DHT-dependent DNA breaks at the established translocation sites, as
revealed by specific recruitment of Ku80 to ERG and TMPRSS2 intronic translocation regions,
but not at other AR binding regions, such as TMPRSS2 ARE III (Figure 7C). However,
expression of an endonuclease-inactive mutant of ORF2 (Goodier et al., 2004) diminished the
enrichment of Ku80 (Figure 7C). Furthermore, overexpression of the LINE-1 ORF2 induced

a marked increase in both intra- and interchromosomal translocations whereas the
endonuclease-inactive mutant partially blocked DHT+IR-induced translocations (Figure 7D).
Interestingly, overexpression of the endonuclease-inactive mutant of ORF2 reduced the DSBs
generation marked by Ku80 recruitment at ERG and TMPRSS2 intronic translocation regions
in DHT+IR treated LNCaP cells, but with minimal effects on the recruitment of AID to the
same regions (Figures 7E and 7F). These data suggest that the LINE-1 ORF2 contributes to
DSBs generation, in combination with the parallel actions of AID.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Indeed, ChIP analysis revealed that LINE-1 ORF2 was selectively recruited in a DHTdependent fashion to the translocation regions, as well as to the enhancer region of
TMPRSS2, but not to the promoter of PSA (Figure 7G). However, we could not detect any
direct physical interaction between AR and LINE-1 ORF2, suggesting the possibility that the
recruitment of LINE-1 ORF2 may result from other events, including the AR-induced
alterations in local chromatin architecture, and the exposed A/T-rich ssDNA that might then
attract LINE-1 ORF2 to these chromatin regions. Importantly, the recruitment of ORF2 to
translocation regions was not affected by removal of AID (Figure 7H), supporting the model
that irradiation-induced LINE-1 ORF2 and AID act as independent mechanisms that
combinatorially contribute to DSBs generation and tumor translocation. Thus, we conclude
that activation of LINE-1 ORF2 expression in tumor cells appears to provide an additional
endonuclease activity that makes an important quantitative contribution to ligand/genotoxic
stress-induced tumor translocations. The functional role of LINE-1 ORF2 in chromosomal
translocation has been further extended based on our findings that overexpression of LINE-1
ORF2 endonuclease-inactive mutant abolished DHT+IR-induced SLC45A3:ETV1
translocation (Figure S20E). Therefore, it is highly possible that LINE-1 ORF2 has a general
function in facilitating chromosomal breaks and global genome instability in cancer cells.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A long-standing concept in tumor translocations has been that genotoxic stress causes direct,
random DSBs that lead to random translocations, with selection of those conferring growth
advantage. Here, by devising and investigating a model of tumor translocations that fully
mimics the frequency of in vivo events without proliferative selection, we suggested that, rather,
there is a site-selective immediate pattern of DSBs that ultimately dictate the pattern of tumor
translocations. This system has permitted the identification of several unexpected mechanisms,
some sequential and others combinatorial, by which the androgen receptor acts in concert with
genotoxic stress as parallel pathways to direct rapid, site-specific and cell type-specific tumor
translocations in the absence of proliferative selection (Figure 7I). Translocation breakpoint
preferences are dictated both by (i) site-specific binding of liganded-AR at intronic
translocation regions that trigger rapid intra- and interchromosomal interactions, which results
in spatial proximity required for translocations, and (ii) induced alterations of local chromatin
architecture are permissive for sensitizing these regions to genotoxic stress. These
transcription-related events, in combination with activation and induction of specific enzymatic
machineries by ligand and genotoxic stress, mechanistically underlie the extended DNA breaks
at the critical intronic AR binding sites. Thus, rather than being entirely the consequence of
random damage-induced DSBs, with selection for the resulting tumor translocations that confer
putative growth advantages as is commonly hypothesized, there appears to have an initial
selective sensitization in a site-specific manner that presages the observed tumor translocations
in prostate cancer. Therefore our findings suggest the provocative concept that ligandedreceptor acts, in a sense, as a mutagen, licensed by the enzymatic machinery activated by
genotoxic stress.
One initial puzzle was how the various TMPRSS2 fusion partners were brought together for
DNA recombination. We found that AR bound to multiple intronic regions near break sites in

TMPRSS2, ERG and ETV1 genes, juxtaposing DNA breaks for subsequent recombination. This
spatial proximity induced by a specific transcription program is reminiscent of the DNA
rearrangement in developing B cells, thus suggesting that a general strategy is exploited for
DNA rearrangement in tumorigenesis as well as during normal development. The requirements
of a nuclear motor for the induced proximity permitted our demonstration that the induction
of this spatial proximity is actually prerequisite for the induced translocation events.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our data indicate that AR acts in concert with a number of key enzymes induced by androgens
and genotoxic stress, including AID, previously considered to be a B cell-specific factor
(Chaudhuri et al., 2003), Gadd45 and quite unexpectedly, the LINE-1-encoded ORF2, to
license extended DSBs. AID is recruited to the intronic AR binding sites as part of the genotoxic
stress-induced Gadd45/AID complex. These recruitments are postulated to be permissive for
potentiating the occurrence of specific translocation breakpoints that we have mapped within
the TMPRSS2, ERG and ETV1 genes. Our data further suggest that only ~20% of intronic AR
binding sites exhibiting induced DSBs. We have further documented that these breaks are
marked by the recruitment of Ku80 and by direct incorporation of BrdU at these sites. The
presence of micro-homology in multiple TMPRSS2:ERG and TMPRSS2:ETV1 fusion sites
lends further support for the model that there are staggered sites of DNA breakage as might be
expected from the sequential actions of AID and UNG, analogous to their predicted functions
in CSR (Stavnezer et al., 2008). Further, we observed the mutations characteristic of somatic
hypermutation within the short region of AID binding sites, reflecting actions of AID at these
intronic break sites. Consistent with our findings, AID has been recently reported to be required
for c-myc:IgH translocations in B cells (Robbiani et al., 2008).
A key challenge was to identify specific machineries altered in tumors that might sensitize the
cell to tumor translocations. The observation that the DHT+IR induced chromosomal
translocations observed in prostate cancer cells were not detected in normal prostate epithelial
cells led to the discovery of the critical, independent role of the PIWI-regulated LINE-1
encoded-ORF2 endonuclease in translocation events. Thus, in addition to the induction of AID
in prostate cancer cells, we have uncovered a second, unexpected component of this
sensitization mechanism based on the diminished expression of PIWIs, which serves as a
dedicated protective strategy to block retrotransposition of LINE-1 elements to ensure genome
stability in germ cells (O'Donnell and Boeke, 2007). Surprisingly, we found that the level of
PIWIL1 was dramatically lower (>9-fold) in LNCaP cells than in normal prostate epithelial
cells. Even at this low level in LNCaP cells, knockdown with specific siRNA caused a further
deprotection of the genome, resulting in increased chromosomal translocations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To our surprise, even in the absence of genotoxic stress, the ORF2 endonuclease appears
capable of targeting to the intronic AR bound sites to license DNA breakage, which emphasizes
its independent, parallel function to AID in generating DSBs at the translocation sites. Our
findings are consistent with the reported elevation of the LINE-1 ORF2 endonuclease activity
in prostate cancer and the inducibility of this enzyme by irradiation (Farkash et al., 2006;
Santourlidis et al., 1999), and also with the documented role of PIWIs in silencing LINE-1
repeat movement during neurogenesis (Muotri et al., 2005).
Because androgens exert important developmental roles in the prostate, we suggest that similar
events might occur in other cancer types in which a selective, regulated DNA binding
transcription factor(s) serves to promote DNA rearrangement. Finally, understanding the
molecular mechanisms that underlie tumor translocations and specific “epigenetic” strategies
used by normal cells to protect the genome against such deleterious DNA rearrangements have
the promise to provide insights into the etiology of cancer and to facilitate the development of
new diagnostic/therapeutic approaches.

Experimental Procedures
Cell Lines and Treatments

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The prostate cancer cell line LNCaP was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). Human Prostate Epithelial Cells (PrEC) were obtained from Lonza and maintained
in PrEGM media. Transfection of LNCaP cells with siRNA and plasmid DNA were performed
using Lipofectamine2000™ (Invitrogen) and Nucleofector® Kit R (Lonza), respectively.
Transfection of PrEC cells with siRNA was performed using DeliverX Plus siRNA transfection
reagent (Panomics). MVA/T7RP-mediated expression of LINE-1 proteins was performed as
previous described (Goodier et al., 2004). For induction of chromosomal translocation, LNCaP
or PrEC cells were grown in charcoal-stripped serum containing media for 48 hr followed by
mock, DHT (10−7 M), γ-irradiation (50 Gy) treatment, or both. After treatments, the cells were
re-incubated for 24hr before being harvested for appropriate assays. Cell viability in cultures
before and after irradiation was assessed by trypan blue exclusion.
Fluorescence in situ Hybridization
PrEC or LNCaP cells were stimulated with vehicle or 10−7 M of DHT for 1hr. Cell nuclei
isolation and DNA-FISH was carried out according to a method previously described (Hu et
al., 2008), and the probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and listed
in Supplemental Table 1.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

DNA-break Labeling and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
The labeling of transient DNA break(s) by BrdU was performed as described (Ju et al.,
2006). ChIP and Re-ChIP were performed as described previously (Shang et al., 2000). The
enrichment of the DNA template was analyzed by QPCR using primers listed in Supplemental
Table 1.
Single-Cell Nuclear Microinjection Assays
The single cell nuclear microinjection assays were performed as described (Perissi et al.,
2004).
Data Analysis and Statistics

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Relative quantities of TMPRSS2:ERG and TMPRSS2:ETV1 fusion transcript were normalized
to Actin and further to the expression level of TMPRSS2. The relative amount of each fusion
transcript was then calibrated to DHT alone or DHT+IR treated control sample as appropriately.
Calibrated quantities are indicated and samples without detectable fusion transcript after 40
cycles of amplification are indicated by 0 (Tomlins et al., 2007). Results are reported as mean
± SEM of three independent experiments. Comparisons were performed using two-tailed
paired Student t-test. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
