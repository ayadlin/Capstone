ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with chronic prostate inflammation resulting
in activation of stress and pro-survival pathways that contribute to disease progression
and chemoresistance. The stress oncoprotein lens epithelium-derived growth factor
p75 (LEDGF/p75), also known as DFS70 autoantigen, promotes cellular survival
against environmental stressors, including oxidative stress, radiation, and cytotoxic
drugs. Furthermore, LEDGF/p75 overexpression in PCa and other cancers has been
associated with features of tumor aggressiveness, including resistance to cell death
and chemotherapy. We report here that the endogenous levels of LEDGF/p75 are
upregulated in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) cells selected
for resistance to the taxane drug docetaxel (DTX). These cells also showed resistance
to the taxanes cabazitaxel (CBZ) and paclitaxel (PTX), but not to the classical inducer
of apoptosis TRAIL. Silencing LEDGF/p75 effectively sensitized taxane-resistant PC3
and DU145 cells to DTX and CBZ, as evidenced by a significant decrease in their
clonogenic potential. While TRAIL induced apoptotic blebbing, caspase-3 processing,
and apoptotic LEDGF/p75 cleavage, which leads to its inactivation, in both taxaneresistant and -sensitive PC3 and DU145 cells, treatment with DTX and CBZ failed to
robustly induce these signature apoptotic events. These observations suggested that
taxanes induce both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death in mCRPC cells,
and that maintaining the structural integrity of LEDGF/p75 is critical for its role in
promoting taxane-resistance. Our results further establish LEDGF/p75 as a stress
oncoprotein that plays an important role in taxane-resistance in mCRPC cells, possibly
by antagonizing drug-induced caspase-independent cell death.

of the prostate leading to an augmented state of cellular
oxidative stress and activation of stress survival pathways
has been linked to PCa pathogenesis and resistance to
therapy [3–7].
Lens Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor of 75kD
(LEDGF/p75) has recently emerged as a stress oncoprotein
that promotes cellular survival against many different
environmental stressors, including oxidative stress, radiation,
heat, serum starvation, and cytotoxic drugs [8–20]. Also
known as PC4 and SFRS1 interacting protein (PSIP1), and
dense fine speckled autoantigen of 70 kD (DFS70), this
protein has attracted considerable attention due to its broad
relevance to cancer, autoimmunity, eye diseases, and HIVAIDS [14, 15]. LEDGF/p75 is the target of autoantibody
responses in a subset of patients with PCa [14, 21], as well
as in patients with diverse chronic inflammatory conditions
and some apparently healthy individuals [14]. While early
studies suggested that LEDGF/p75 was a growth factor
critical for the proliferation of lens epithelial cells [8],
subsequent studies have demonstrated that this protein is not
a lens specific growth factor but rather a ubiquitous nuclear
transcription co-activator with oncogenic functions that is
activated during the cellular response to stress [14, 15].
Our group and others have shown that LEDGF/p75
is upregulated in PCa and in other human cancer types,
and that overexpression of this protein in cancer cells is
associated with features of tumor aggressiveness, such as
increased proliferation, resistance to cell death and therapy,
invasion, migration, clonogenicity, angiogenesis, and
tumor growth [11, 15–25]. In a previous study we reported
that LEDGF/p75 overexpression in PCa cells promoted
resistance against caspase-independent cell death induced
through lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP)
by the taxane drug docetaxel (DTX), the gold standard
for advanced PCa chemotherapy [18]. These results
were consistent with studies in other cancer cell types
demonstrating that LEDGF/p75 overexpression promoted
cellular protection against LMP-inducing drugs [19].
More recently, we provided evidence that LEDGF/p75
overexpression in PCa cells promotes protection against
necrotic cell death induced by oxidative stress [20].
The mechanisms by which LEDGF/p75 promotes
resistance to stress-induced cell death have not been fully
elucidated, although available evidence suggests that
this oncoprotein is upregulated or activated in response
to environmental stressors [8-14, 17-20, 22, 24-25].
Acting as a transcription co-activator, it contributes to the
transactivation of stress, antioxidant, and cancer-associated
genes through interaction with transcription complexes
involving RNA polymerase II, PC4 transcription factor,
menin-MLL (mixed leukemia lineage), the MeCP2
transcription activator/repressor, and c-MYC-associated
protein JPO2 [26–31]. LEDGF/p75 target genes include
heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), oxidoreductase ERP57/
PDIA3/GRP58, cytoglobin (CYGB), peroxiredoxin 6
(PRDX6), involucrin, alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde
dehydrogenase, αB-crystallin, gamma glutamylcysteine

synthase, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C),
and interleukin 6 (IL-6) [12, 13, 20, 22, 23, 28, 32-41].
Recent evidence points to LEDGF/p75 as a promising
druggable target for HIV and leukemia therapy [42–44].
In light of our previous demonstration that LEDGF/p75
overexpression in PCa cells promoted resistance to DTX
[18], the present study was conducted to determine if
targeting LEDGF/p75 in chemoresistant PCa cells would
re-sensitize these cells to the clinically relevant taxane
drugs DTX and cabazitaxel (CBZ), which are the first and
second line cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs, respectively,
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer (mCRPC) [45, 46]. In addition, since LEDGF/p75
promoted protection against DTX-induced lysosomal cell
death and stress-induced caspase-independent cell death in
PCa cells [18, 20], we explored if the protective functions
of LEDGF/p75 are linked to the ability of DTX and CBZ
to activate caspase-independent mechanisms of cell death in
drug-resistant PCa pre-clinical models. This study represents
the first step in the development of a multi-targeting approach
involving LEDGF/p75 in combination with taxanes to resensitize chemoresistant mCRPC cells to therapy.

RESULTS
LEDGF/p75 is overexpressed in DTX-resistant
DU145 and PC3 cells
We determined the expression of LEDGF/p75 in
the DTX-resistant mCRPC cell lines DU145-DR and
PC3-DR, compared to the drug sensitive parental DU145
and PC3 cells. These cells were developed to be resistant
to DTX by selecting and expanding the surviving cells
after successive treatments with increasing concentrations
of the drug. We observed that the expression of LEDGF/
p75 was significantly upregulated at the transcript and
protein level as DU145 and PC3 cells made the transition
from chemosensitivity to chemoresistance (Figure 1). The
DU145-DR cells displayed a significant 3.87 fold increase in
LEDGF/p75 transcript expression compared to the parental
DU145 cells (Figure 1A, left panel). To determine if the
increase in transcript expression correlated with increased
protein expression, we collected total lysates from DU145
and DU145-DR cells and performed immunoblotting using
an antibody specific for LEDGF/p75. We observed that
LEDGF/p75 was robustly expressed in the DU145-DR cells
compared to the parental cells (Figure 1B, left panel). To
further confirm these findings, we then proceeded to analyze
LEDGF/p75 expression by immunofluorescence microscopy
using a well-characterized human autoantibody against this
protein [47]. Acquiring the images under exactly the same
parameters, we observed that the fluorescence intensity
of nuclear dense fine speckles, corresponding to LEDGF/
p75 staining [28, 47], in the DU145-DR cells was higher
compared to the intensity in the chemosensitive DU145 cells
(Figure 1C, left panel).

The same experimental procedures were performed to
assess LEDGF/p75 expression in the PC3 and PC3-DR cells.
When we compared the LEDGF/p75 transcript expression
in these two cell lines, we observed a significant 3.60 fold
increase in the transcript levels in PC3-DR compared to the
sensitive PC3 cells (Figure 1A, right panel). As in DU145DR cells, there was a robust increase in LEDGF/p75 protein
expression in the PC3-DR cells compared to the parental

PC3 cells (Figure 1B, right panel). Also, similar to DU145DR cells, the fluorescence intensity of LEDGF/p75 staining
in PC3-DR cells was higher when compared under identical
imaging conditions to the PC3 cells (Figure 1C, right panel).
Taken together, these findings showed higher endogenous
expression of LEDGF/p75 in DTX-resistant cells at both the
transcript and protein levels compared to their drug-sensitive
parental cells.

Figure 1: LEDGF/p75 is overexpressed in DTX-resistant DU145 and PC3 cells. LEDGF/p75 transcript levels were quantified

using mRNA isolated from DU145 and DU145-DR cells by qPCR in at least three independent experiments (A., left panel). Statistical
significance was determined in comparison to control DU145 cells using Student’s t-test (** p<0.01). LEDGF/p75 protein expression
was evaluated in lysates from DU145 and DU145-DR cells by immunoblotting using a rabbit anti-LEDGF/p75 antibody that specifically
detects this protein at 75kDa (B., left panel). β-actin was used as loading control. Fluorescence intensity of nuclear dense fine speckles
characteristic of LEDGF/p75 was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy in DU145 and DU145-DR cells, using a human
anti-LEDGF/p75 autoantibody (C., left panel). LEDGF/p75 transcript levels were also quantified using mRNA isolated from PC3 and PC3DR cells by qPCR in at least three independent experiments (A, right panel). P values were determined in comparison to control PC3 cells
using Student’s t-test (**p<0.01). LEDGF/p75 protein expression was evaluated in lysates from PC3 and PC3-DR cells by immunoblotting
using a rabbit anti-LEDGF/p75 antibody (B, right panel). β-actin was used as loading control. Fluorescence intensity of nuclear dense fine
speckles characteristic of LEDGF/p75 was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy in PC3 and PC3-DR cells, using a human

DU145-DR and PC3-DR cells are resistant to
multiple taxanes but not to TRAIL

treated our chemosensitive and chemoresistant PCa cells
with tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand
(TRAIL), an inducer of caspase-dependent apoptosis. In
previous studies we observed that while ectopic LEDGF/
p75 overexpression promoted protection against stressors
that induced caspase-independent cell death such as DTX
and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), it did not confer
protection against classical inducers of caspase-dependent
cell death such as TRAIL and staurosporine (STS) [18, 20].
Therefore, we sought to reproduce these observations in
chemoresistant PCa cells naturally overexpressing LEDGF/
p75 after selection.
For these studies, we treated DU145-DR cells and
DU145 cells with increasing concentrations of DTX,
PTX, or CBZ for up to 72 hr, and TRAIL for up to 24
hr (Figure  2A) and determined the approximate drugs’
half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50). We

We then investigated if the DTX-resistant PCa cells,
which showed endogenous overexpression of LEDGF/
p75, were selectively resistant to DTX or also showed
multi-drug resistance, particularly to other taxanes such
as CBZ and paclitaxel/taxol (PTX). Currently, CBZ is the
second-line cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drug available for
advanced PCa patients that develop resistance to DTX [45,
46]. We also included in our analysis PTX, the original
taxane and parent drug of both DTX and CBZ. Although
not currently used for clinical treatment of advanced PCa,
PTX is commonly used in the treatment of other tumor
types [48], and it was therefore important to determine if
DTX-resistant cancer cells overexpressing LEDGF/p75
also promote resistance to this parental taxane. We also

observed higher viability in DU145-DR cells treated with
DTX (EC50 ≈ 200 nM), and PTX (EC50 ≈ 300 nM),
compared to DU145 cells, which showed EC50s of 10
nM and 20 nM, respectively. In the dose response curves,
a statistically significant difference in the percentage of
surviving cells could be observed at all concentrations
(range 10-1000 nM). Interestingly, when we examined
the difference in the overall survival between DU145DR and DU145 cells treated with CBZ, there was a trend
toward higher survival in the DU145-DR cells, with
EC50 values of 11 nM in the DU145-DR cells and 2 nM
in the DU145 cells. For CBZ, there was a statistically
significant difference in survival at concentrations above
10 nM. We did not observe a difference in survival when
DTX-resistant and -sensitive cell lines were treated with
increasing concentrations of TRAIL. Both cell lines
showed high sensitivity to low concentrations of this cell
death ligand (10 ng/ml).
Similar experiments with PC3-DR and PC3 cells
revealed a statistically significant difference in the
percentage of surviving PC3-DR cells compared to PC3
cells after exposure to DTX, with EC50s of 100 nM and
10 nM, respectively (Figure 2B). We also observed a
statistically significant increased survival in PC3-DR cells
exposed to PTX, with an EC50 of 1000 nM, compared to
an EC50 of 100 nM for PC3 cells. Consistent with results
obtained with the DU145-DR and DU145 cells, there
was an overall trend in the difference in survival between
PC3-DR cells and PC3 cells after treatment with CBZ.
We obtained EC50s of 50 nM for PC3-DR and 5 nM for
PC3 cells, with statistically significant differences at CBZ
concentrations below 1 nM. Like in DU145 cells, we did
not observe any differences when PC3-DR and PC3 cells
were treated with TRAIL.
We then proceeded to examine the morphology of
the cells under the different treatment conditions (Figure
2C). We observed that DTX-resistant cells had a relatively
normal morphology with fewer floating cells and features
of cell death, compared to the sensitive cell lines which
clearly showed increased cell death when treated
with DTX, PTX, or CBZ at the low pharmacological
concentrations of 10 nM, 1 μM, and 10 nM, respectively.
Robust apoptotic cell death could be observed upon
treatment with TRAIL. In summary, there was increased
cell survival in the DTX-resistant cell lines, which express
high endogenous levels of LEDGF/p75, during treatment
with increasing concentrations of the different taxanes.
However, none of the cell lines showed resistance to
TRAIL.

the contribution of LEDGF/p75 to the observed taxane
resistance in DU145-DR and PC3-DR cells. For these
experiments, we transiently knocked down LEDGF/p75
in our drug-resistant models using small inhibitory RNAs
(siRNAs) specific for this protein [20, 33]. We sought to
determine if LEDGF/p75 knockdown alone decreased
the clonogenic potential of taxane-resistant cells, and if
its combination with drug treatment further sensitized
the cells to taxane chemotherapy. We chose clonogenic
assays for these experiments because they could clearly
show cellular sensitization to the treatments over time
by decrease in colony formation. The spatial constraints
(96 well plates) that we encountered in short-term MTT
viability assays did not permit to assess the long-term
effects of drugs on cell growth. Colony formation assays
have been widely used to determine the effects of LEDGF/
p75 knockdown on its tumorigenic properties as well as its
ability to promote resistance to non-taxane drugs in nonPCa cell models [19, 23, 25, 27, 51].
Transient knockdown of LEDGF/p75 in DU145-DR
and PC3-DR cells led to robust depletion of the protein
compared to cells transfected with scrambled duplex
siRNA (siSD) control (Figure 3A and 4A). LEDGF/
p75 depletion was still robust 96 hr post-transfection in
both cell lines, indicating that it was stable at the time
the cells were treated with the DTX or CBZ during the
initial hours of clonogenic growth (Figure 3A and 4A).
We focused on DTX and CBZ on these and subsequent
experiments because they are the first and second line
chemotherapeutic drugs, respectively, currently used for
the clinical treatment of mCRPC.
LEDGF/p75 depletion alone in DU145-DR cells
in the absence of taxanes significantly reduced colony
formation by 50.7% compared to untreated siSD control
cells (Figure 3B, 3C, 3D). On the other hand, treatment
with DTX alone, without LEDGF/p75 depletion,
significantly reduced colony formation by 35% and 55.3%
at concentrations of 50 nM and 100 nM, respectively,
compared to the untreated siSD control cells (Figure 3C),
indicating an EC50 for DTX alone of approximately 100
nM. However, the combination of LEDGF/p75 depletion
plus 50 nM DTX or 100 nM DTX reduced colony
formation by 75.2% and 83.4%, respectively, when
compared to untreated SD-control cells (Figure 3C), and
by 49.7% and 66.4%, respectively, when compared to
LEDGF/p75 depletion alone (Figure 3D). These results
indicated that the combination of DTX plus LEDGF/p75
depletion chemosensitized the cells, with EC50 < 50 nM,
compared to untreated cells.
In the case of CBZ, this drug alone, without LEDGF/
p75 depletion, significantly reduced colony formation in
DU145-DR cells by 14.2% and 41.8% at concentrations
of 0.1 nM and 1 nM, respectively, when compared to
untreated siSD-control cells (Figure 3B, 3C), indicating an
EC50 above 1 nM. However, the combination of LEDGF/
p75 depletion plus 0.1 nM CBZ or 1 nM CBZ reduced

colony formation by 66.1% and 83.8%, respectively, when
compared to untreated siSD control cells (Figure 3C),
and by 31.2% and 67.1%, when compared to LEDGF/
p75 depletion alone (Figure 3D). These results indicated
that the combination of CBZ plus LEDGF/p75 depletion
chemosensitized the cells, with EC50 < 0.1 nM, compared
to untreated cells.
DU145-DR cells transfected with siSD control
oligos or si-LEDGF/p75 were equally sensitive to 100
ng/ml TRAIL, a concentration used in previous studies
to efficiently induce caspase-dependent apoptosis [18,
21] and which did not yield any colonies (Figure 3B, 3C,
3D). These results were consistent with results shown
in Figure 2 in which DU145 cells, both DTX sensitive
resistant, were equally sensitive to a wide range of TRAIL
concentrations (10 ng/ml-100 ng/ml).

We then performed similar studies to determine
the effects of transient LEDGF/p75 depletion in PC3-DR
cells, with and without drug treatment. We observed a
significant decrease (24.4%) in the clonogenicity of PC3DR cells after LEDGF/p75 depletion compared to the
siSD control cells, although the effect was not as robust
as in the DU145-DR cells (Figure 4B, 4C). Treatment
with DTX alone, without LEDGF/p75 depletion, reduced
PC3-DR colony formation by 10.4% and 18.6% at
concentrations of 50 nM and 100 nM, respectively,
compared to the untreated siSD control cells (Figure 4C),
indicating an EC50 well above 100 nM. However, the
combination of LEDGF/p75 depletion plus 50 nM DTX
or 100 nM DTX reduced colony formation in the PC3-DR
cells by 46.7% and 57.9%, respectively, when compared
to untreated SD-control cells (Figure 4C), and by 29.5%

and 44.4%, respectively, when compared to LEDGF/
p75 depletion alone (Figure 4D). These results indicated
that the combination of DTX plus LEDGF/p75 depletion
chemosensitized the cells, with an EC50 between 50 and
100 nM, compared to untreated cells.
Treatment of PC3-DR cells with CBZ alone, without
LEDGF/p75 depletion, significantly reduced clonogenicity
by 7.7% and 24.1% at concentrations of 0.1 nM and 1 nM,
respectively, when compared to untreated siSD-control cells
(Figure 4C), indicating an EC50 well above 1 nM. However,
the combination of LEDGF/p75 depletion plus 0.1 nM CBZ
or 1 nM CBZ reduced PC3-DR colony formation by 36.2%
and 54.2%, respectively, when compared to untreated siSD
control cells (Figure 3B), and by 15.6% and 39.4%, when
compared to LEDGF/p75 depletion alone (Figure 4D).
These results indicated that the combination of CBZ plus

LEDGF/p75 depletion chemosensitized the cells, with EC50
< 1 nM, compared to untreated cells.
Like in DU145-DR cells, we also observed that
PC3-DR cells transfected with siSD control oligos or siLEDGF/p75 were equally sensitive to 100 ng/ml TRAIL.
Taken together, these results showed that LEDGF/p75
depletion in DU145-DR and PC3-DR cells significantly
diminished their clonogenicity, an effect that was
enhanced in combination with taxanes.

induced lysosomal cell death and to oxidative stress-induced
necrosis, but not to classical apoptosis inducers such as
TRAIL and stauroporine (STS) [18, 20]. In addition, studies
from our group showed that during caspase-dependent
cell death triggered by classical apoptosis inducers (e.g.,
Fas, TRAIL, STS, etoposide), LEDGF/p75 is cleaved by
caspases-3 and -7, generating various cleavage fragments,
including a signature fragment of 65 kD that lacks prosurvival activity and exacerbates cell death in the presence
of stress [11, 20–21]. We also demonstrated that this protein
has a short splice variant, LEDGF/p52, which induces
apoptosis when ectopically overexpressed leading to
LEDGF/p75 cleavage and impaired ability to transactivate
stress survival genes [52]. Together, these observations
suggested that the stress protective effects of LEDGF/p75
are more relevant in the context of cellular resistance to
stress-induced caspase-independent cell death, where lack
of caspase activation results in preservation of LEDGF/p75
structural integrity, which is essential for its transcriptional
and stress survival functions [11, 32, 52].
In light of these previous observations and
the observed contribution of LEDGF/p75 to cellular
resistance to taxanes but not TRAIL, we designed
experiments to determine if the structural integrity of
LEDGF/p75 is preserved during taxane-induced cell
death. For these studies, we treated DTX-sensitive and
-resistant DU145 and PC3 cells with concentrations
of DTX (100 nM), CBZ (100 nM), or TRAIL (100 ng/
ml) that caused cell death in the previous experiments
(Figures 2-4). We first examined by Western blotting if
there was caspase-3 processing under these treatments,
which would be indicative of activation of caspasedependent apoptosis, using an antibody that specifically
recognizes cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 5A). We observed
the appearance of strong bands corresponding to
cleaved caspase-3 fragment in lysates from both DTXsensitive and -resistant cells treated with TRAIL.
However, we did not detect robust processing of
caspase-3 in DU145 or PC3 cells, both sensitive and
resistant, 72 hr after exposure to 100 nM DTX, in spite
of observing significant cell death at this concentration
and time point, particularly in the sensitive cells, in
previous experiments (Figure 2). Overexposure of
chemiluminescent blots to film did not result in increased
detection of caspase-3 cleavage in cells treated with DTX
or CBZ (data not shown). There was a slight detection
of cleaved caspase-3 in DU145 cells treated with 100
nM CBZ (Figure 5A), in spite of the extensive loss of
cell survival observed at this concentration in previous
experiments (Figure 2). These experiments suggested
that while TRAIL clearly induces caspase-dependent
cell death in these cell lines, both sensitive and resistant,
DTX and CBZ did not induce a comparatively robust
caspase-3 processing and activation at the relatively high
pharmacological concentrations used.

We then proceeded to determine if LEDGF/p75
was cleaved during the same experimental conditions.
As expected, we observed robust cleavage of LEDGF/
p75 into its signature apoptotic 65 kD fragment in DU145
and PC3 cells, both sensitive and resistant, treated with
TRAIL (Figure 5B). This fragment was detected using
human anti-LEDGF/p75 autoantibodies, which recognize
a C-terminal autoepitope region that is preserved in
the apoptotic cleavage fragments [11, 20]. However,
LEDGF/p75 was minimally cleaved during the 72 hr
treatment with 100 nM DTX in all cell lines (Figure 5B).
Although cleavage was more visible, albeit still weak, in
cells treated with 100 nM CBZ, it did not achieve the
robustness of the cleavage induced by TRAIL (Figure
5B). These results were consistent with the observed
minimal processing of caspase-3 during taxane-induced
cell death, with robust processing during TRAIL-induced
apoptosis (Figure 5A).
In light of these results we proceeded to examine
closely the morphology of DU145 and PC3 cells, both
DTX-sensitive and -resistant, treated with 100 nM
DTX, 100 nM CBZ, or 100 ng/ml TRAIL to assess the
features of cell death (Figure 5C). The TRAIL-treated
cells exhibited the classical apoptotic morphology
characterized by extensive blebbing and shrinkage.
By contrast, cells exposed to DTX and CBZ exhibited
rounding and floating, consistent with mitotic arrest and
catastrophe, as well as cells that appeared to be swollen
and with breakage of the cell membrane. While there
were cells displaying apoptotic blebbing, this feature
was not as prominent in the taxane-treated cells as in the
cells treated with TRAIL. These results are consistent
with the observation of robust caspase-3 processing
and LEDGF/p75 cleavage during TRAIL-induced cell
death (Figure 5A) but not during taxane treatment
(Figure 5B).

LEDGF/p75 depletion does not influence the
expression of the multidrug resistance protein
P-glycoprotein in DTX-resistant PCa cells
The molecular mechanisms by which LEDGF/
p75 promotes taxane resistance are relatively unknown,
although they are likely linked to its ability to
transcriptionally co-activate stress survival genes. Given
the established role of multidrug resistance or transporter
proteins such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp, also known as
ABCB1 or MDR1) in PCa chemoresistance [53, 54], we
speculated that LEDGF/p75 might upregulate this protein
in taxane resistant cells. For these experiments, we first
compared the expression of P-gp in DU145-DR and PC3DR cells to the drug-sensitive, parental DU145 and PC3
cells. Consistent with its role in chemoresistance, P-gp
was not expressed in the sensitive cell lines but was highly
expressed in the drug-resistant cells (Figure 6A). We then

determined if transient LEDGF/p75 depletion (up to 72h)
in the taxane resistant cells led to downregulation of P-gp.
Our results indicated that LEDGF/p75 depletion had no
effect on P-gp expression levels in DU145-DR and PC3DR, suggesting that P-gp is not a target gene of this stress
transcription co-activator.

DTX-induced caspase-independent cell death caused
by LMP, as well as oxidative stress-induced necrosis,
but not to the apoptosis inducers TRAIL and STS [18,
20]. Given its role as a stress transcription coactivator,
LEDGF/p75 activation by cancer cells is likely to
counter rapid increases in oxidative stress that might
overwhelm cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms and
induce DNA damage and LMP.
In this study we used mCRPC cellular models (PC3
and DU145) that were selected over time for their acquired
resistance to DTX. While multiple mechanisms of taxaneresistance likely operate in these cells, we focused on
LEDGF/p75 given our previous observations linking its
ectopic overexpression to DTX resistance in mCRPC cells
[18]. Our results clearly demonstrated the upregulation of
endogenous LEDGF/p75 in DU145-DR and PC3-DR cells.
This upregulation did not appear to occur during short-term
exposure to DTX because cells treated with increasing
concentrations of DTX for up to 48 hr did not show LEDGF/
p75 upregulation (data not shown). However, as we selected
chemoresistant clones after weeks of exposure to increasing
concentrations of DTX, we began to detect elevated
endogenous LEDGF/p75 levels, suggesting that this stress
protein contributes to the selection of surviving cells in the
presence of DTX.
Our results also showed that DTX-resistant
DU145 and PC3 cells displayed increased resistance to
PTX and CBZ, compared to sensitive cells, at a wide
range of pharmacological concentrations. However, both
DTX-sensitive and -resistant cell lines showed robust
sensitivity to TRAIL. These results suggested that the
mechanisms of DTX resistance operating in these cells
could also apply to PTX and CTX resistance, but not
to TRAIL. The exquisite sensitivity of taxane-resistant
cells to TRAIL suggests that apoptosis induction
via death receptor signaling could be used to bypass
the cellular protective functions of LEDGF/p75 and
other survival proteins that are susceptible to caspasemediated cleavage and inactivation. Unfortunately,
efforts to target TRAIL receptors in clinical trials have
been tempered by increased toxicity to cancer patients,
most likely due to the high levels of these receptors in
normal tissues [59].
Recent efforts to target LEDGF/p75 in the context
of HIV-AIDS and leukemia have provided “proof-ofprinciple” that this protein is a druggable molecular
target [27, 43, 44, 51, 60]. We reasoned that if LEDGF/
p75 upregulation occurs during development of taxane
chemoresistance, then targeting this protein in preclinical mCRPC models in combination with taxanes
would sensitize sub-populations of resistant tumor
cells to these drugs. Our results revealed that transient
LEDGF/p75 depletion by itself, without drug treatment,
attenuated the clonogenicity of both DTX-sensitive and
-resistant PC3 and DU145 cells, consistent with results
from other groups using other tumor cell models [19,

DISCUSSION
Our understanding of mechanisms underlying
mCRPC has improved the outcomes for the management
of this disease, with new therapeutic regimens that
include sipuleucel-T, denosumab, abiraterone acetate,
enzalutamide, and taxane therapy [55]. Unfortunately,
despite these advances and overall increase in patient
survival, mCRPC is still a challenging disease to
manage, with most patients dying within three years
of diagnosis due to therapy resistance, particularly to
taxanes [49, 50, 53, 55-58]. The goal of the present
study was to further establish the role of LEDGF/p75
in PCa taxane resistance and its potential as a novel
therapeutic target for overcoming this resistance.
Our group and others have provided evidence for the
role of this protein in promoting tumor aggressive
properties and chemoresistance in various cancer types
[11, 17-20, 22-27]. We reported previously that stable
overexpression of LEDGF/p75 in PC3 cells attenuated

25]. It should be noted, however, that LEDGF/p75 is not
essential for cell viability under normal growth conditions
since cancer cell lines with stable knockdown of this
protein have been effectively developed [20, 28]. Also,
PSIP1/LEDGF/p75-\- knockout mice were viable despite
suffering from multiple skeletal malformations leading to
increased perinatal mortality [61]. However, under stress
conditions, LEDGF/p75 plays a key role in enhancing cell
survival [13, 14].
Our results also showed that LEDGF/p75
depletion in combination with DTX or CBZ significantly
decreased the clonogenic potential of both DU145-DR
and PC3-DR cells, particularly at higher, albeit still
pharmacological, drug concentrations. Given the limited
range of taxane concentrations used in our clonogenic
assays, it was not possible to determine with precision
the exact EC50 values for drug-resistant DU145 and PC3
cells treated with either DTX or CBZ, with or without
LEDGF/p75 depletion. While our results suggest a
possible additive effect of the combinatorial treatment of
taxanes plus LEDGF/p75 depletion, we cannot rule out
the possibility that this combination acts synergistically
to re-sensitize resistant cells. This could be explored in
future studies by applying the Chou Talalay statistical
method [62] to results from experiments in which a
broad range of concentrations of both taxanes and

small molecule inhibitors of LEDGF/p75 are combined.
Our data also indicated that the anti-survival effects of
LEDGF/p75 silencing was more pronounced in DU145DR cells, consistent with the previous observation that
LEDGF/p75 silencing in DU145 cells impairs their
aggressive properties [23].
LEDGF/p75 silencing did not completely sensitize
resistant cells to DTX and CBZ, most likely due to
the contribution of other independent mechanisms,
possibly involving clusterin and P-gp drug transporter,
to taxane resistance [49, 50, 53, 54]. Indeed, our results
demonstrated that LEDGF/p75 depletion does not
downregulate P-gp in taxane-resistant cells, suggesting
that these two proteins act independently of each other.
We cannot rule out, however, that LEDGF/p75 may
transcriptionally activate P-gp in resistant cells but the
cellular stability of this drug transporter may not make
it susceptible to downregulation in response to LEDGF/
p75 depletion. Interestingly, a previous study showed
that while P-gp is dramatically upregulated in several
chemoresistant PCa cell lines, its inhibition reversed the
resistant phenotype on a cell-line dependent manner,
which would be consistent with the notion that multiple
mechanisms of drug resistance may be activated in
prostate tumor cells in response to chemotherapy [54].
Identifying resistance mechanisms independent of

P-gp is therefore important since targeting this drugtransporter has not been highly successful because of the
complexity of toxicity, adverse side effects, and altered
pharmacokinetics encountered in studies [63].
Maintaining the structural integrity of LEDGF/
p75, particularly its C-terminal domain, is essential for
its transcriptional and stress survival functions [11, 32,
52]. During apoptosis, caspase-3 mediated cleavage
removes the extreme N-terminal and C-terminal
regions of LEDGF/p75, abrogating its stress survival
functions [11]. This could explain why LEDGF/
p75 overexpression in cancer cells typically does not
confer protection against insults that robustly activate
caspase-3, such as TRAIL and STS, which result in
LEDGF/p75 cleavage and inactivation, but does protect
against insults that induce LMP and even necrotic cell
death, which leave the protein relatively intact [18, 19,
64]. While several reports have underscored the antiapoptotic role of LEDGF/p75 in cancer cells, the exact
mode of cell death, and the possibility that caspasedependent and caspase-independent pathways operate
in parallel under the experimental conditions used, have
not been fully characterized in these studies [17, 23, 24,
65]. Nevertheless, it is plausible that LEDGF/p75 could
promote protection against apoptosis if this mode of cell
death occurs downstream of events antagonized by this
protein such as DNA damage and LMP [18-19, 24, 64].
Our observation that DTX and CBZ did not induce
robust caspase-3 processing and LEDGF/p75 cleavage
at relatively high pharmacological plasma concentrations
that induce cell death (100 nM), suggests that insufficient
apoptosis induced by taxanes may lead to drug resistance
by preserving the structural integrity of LEDGF/p75
and other stress survival proteins that otherwise would
be cleaved and inactivated during apoptotic caspase-3
activation (Figure 7). In a previous study, we showed that
caspase-3 activity and LEDGF/p75 cleavage could be
induced in PC3 cells, albeit not robustly, at micromolar
concentrations of DTX [18]. While high micromolar
DTX concentrations are detected in plasma of cancer
patients early after drug administration, typically they
drop to the low nanomolar range a few days posttreatment, which may prevent induction of robust and
sustained tumor cell apoptosis [66]. Consistent with this,
a recent study indicated that intratumoral accumulation of
DTX and CBZ is key for their efficacy, with development
of DTX resistance occurring if accumulation of this drug
is insufficient [67].
The limited caspase-3 processing and LEDGF/
p75 cleavage in taxane treated mCRPC cells observed in
this study is consistent with the recent observation that
DTX is a poor inducer of caspase-dependent apoptosis
in DU145 cells [68], and our previous observation that
DTX induces both caspase-dependent and caspaseindependent lysosomal cell death in PC3 cells [18]. It
is likely that induction of both caspase-dependent and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

-independent cell death by taxanes occurs in parallel in
the tumor microenvironment, and that depending on the
cellular context and local drug concentration, one cell
death mode may be preferred over the other [18, 69,
70]. This then raises the intriguing question of whether
there are intrinsic mechanisms in mCRPC tumors,
such as upregulation of LEDGF/p75 and other stress
oncoproteins, that favor promoting resistance to taxaneinduced caspase-independent cell death. Although
the mechanisms of cellular resistance to taxanes are
not completely understood, current evidence points to
tubulin mutations, multidrug transporters, androgen
receptor-mutations, and overexpression of transcription
factors and stress proteins such as Stat1, Stat3, NF-kB,
Hsp27, and Clusterin [49, 50, 53, 54, 71]. It remains
to be established, however, whether some of these
mechanisms effectively antagonize taxane-induced
caspase-independent cell death. If this turns out to be
the case, then targeting multiple molecular pathways
that protect tumor cells against both caspase-dependent
and caspase-independent cell death could be an effective
strategy to overcome taxane resistance in mCRPC. Since
LEDGF/p75 appears to be a novel promoter of mCRPC
cell resistance to taxane-induced caspase-independent
cell death, this protein could be considered as a
promising therapeutic target to overcome this resistance
in combinatorial therapies.
Finally, understanding the complex mechanisms
underlying LEDGF/p75-promoted taxane resistance will
require a close examination of the regulatory mechanisms
controlling the expression of this stress protein during PCa
transition to chemoresistance. To date, known mechanisms
of LEDGF/p75 regulation include its activation by
transcription factor Sp1 [72, 73], as well as repression
by sumoylation, TGF-β, Bcl-2, ERK, and its small splice
variant LEDGF/p52 [52, 74–76]. A crosstalk between
LEDGF/p75 activation and the STAT3/IL6 inflammatory
pathway, implicated in PCa, has also been identified in
HaCaT skin cancer cells and in breast cancer cells [41, 77].
Future studies will explore whether acquisition of taxaneresistance in mCRPC involves activation or suppression of
LEDGF/p75 regulatory mechanisms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, antibodies and reagents
The metastatic PCa cell lines DU145 (brain
metastasis) and PC3 (bone metastasis) were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
(Cat.# HTB-81 and Cat.# CRL-1435, respectively). Cells
were cultured following supplier’s instructions in RPMI
medium (Life Technologies – Thermo Fisher Scientific)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
penicillin/streptomycin, and gentamicin. Cells were
maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at
24926

37°C. The DTX-resistant cell line variants were developed
as described previously [20]. Briefly, DU145 and PC3
cells were cultured in media containing 1 nM DTX and
then surviving cells were passaged four times before
increasing the concentration of DTX. This was repeated
until resistant cells could be maintained with minimal cell
death in media containing 10 nM DTX.
The following commercially acquired antibodies
were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-LEDGF/p75 (1:1000,
Bethyl Laboratories Inc. catalog# A300-848A); rabbit
monoclonal anti-β-actin (1:5000, Cell Signaling catalog #
5125); rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000,
Cell Signaling catalog # 9661); rabbit monoclonal antiP-gp/MDR1/ABCB1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling catalog
# 13342) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled
secondary IgG antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:5000,
Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog # 31466; goat antihuman IgG/IgA/IgM, 1:5000, Thermo Fisher Scientific
catalog # A18847). The human autoantibody to LEDGF/
p75 (1:200) was from the serum bank of the Casiano
Laboratory at the Center for Health Disparities and
Molecular Medicine at Loma Linda University School
of Medicine. The following cytotoxic drugs were used:
DTX (LC-Laboratories), PTX (Sigma-Aldrich), and
CBZ (Sanofi-Aventis). TNF-related apoptosis inducing
ligand (TRAIL) was purchased from Peprotech and
Actinomycin D was purchased from R&D Systems.

plus mini kit (Qiagen). The iScript cDNA synthesis
kit (BioRad) was used to reverse transcribe RNA
(0.5 μg) into cDNA. qPCR was performed using
the MyiQ real-time PCR detection system with
primers using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad)
following manufacturers’ recommendations. Primer
sequences for LEDGF/p75 were designed using the
Primer3 software. Forward sequence (5’ to 3’) was
TGCTTTTCCAGACATGGTTGT and reverse sequence
(3’ to 5’) was CCCACAAACAGTGAAAAGACAG.
Primers were commercially synthetized by Integrated
DNA Technologies (IDT). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was used for
normalization. Data was normalized to values of
corresponding controls and analyzed in three different
experiments, each in triplicates.

Immunoblotting procedures
Immunoblotting was performed as described
previously [28]. Briefly, equal amounts of protein from
whole cell lysates were separated using sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE, NuPAGE 4–12%, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
transferred into polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membranes
(Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% dry milk
or 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), depending on the
primary antibody, prepared in TBS-T buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.6, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes
were then probed individually with primary antibodies and
corresponding secondary antibodies and washed several
times with TBS-T between each antibody application.
Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used to detect
immunoreactive protein bands. For this, the ECL Western
Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Pierce,
catalog # 32106) was added to the antibody-protein surface
of each membrane, followed by incubation for 5 minutes.
Membranes were then transferred to autoradiography
cassettes and exposed to autoradiography films for
different lengths of time to ensure accurate detection of
immunoreactive protein bands.

Viability assays
PCa cells were treated with the different taxane
drugs at the selected concentrations for up to 72 hr, or
with TRAIL plus 100 ng/ml Actinomycin D for up to
24 hr. Cell morphology was visualized on an Olympus
IX70 microscope equipped with Hoffmann Modulation
Contrast (Olympus American) and a digital Spot Imaging
System (Diagnostic Instruments). To assess viability,
cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1x104
cells per well and then treated with each individual drug
in at least triplicates. A modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
(Sigma-Aldrich) was performed as described previously
[18]. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a
μQuant microplate reader (Bio-tek Instruments). Values
were normalized to the absorbance obtained for the
untreated, control cells. The approximate drug halfmaximal effective concentration (EC50) was determined
using the plotted values of the dose response curve.
Each value represents the mean value of at least three
different experiments in triplicates. The standard error of
the mean (SEM) was calculated for each value.

Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy
To visualize endogenous LEDGF/p75 expression,
cells were grown on coverslips, washed with PBS, then
fixed with 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with
0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with
human anti-LEDGF/p75 serum autoantibody [47] at 1:200
dilution for one hour in a humid chamber. After washes
with PBS, cells were incubated with a FITC-conjugated
goat anti-human IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (1:200,
Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog # 62-7111), used at
1:200 dilution. Cells were mounted and counterstained
with medium containing 4’,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole
(DAPI) (Vectashield). Images were acquired in a BioRevo
Keyence BZ-9000 fluorescent microscope (Keyence). All

Quantitative real-time PCR

RNA interference-mediated knockdown of
LEDGF/p75 in PCa cells
To achieve transient knockdown of LEDGF/p75
in our cellular models, specific short inhibitory RNAs
(siRNAs) were used as described previously [20, 33].
Specifically, the si-LEDGF/p75 sequence corresponded
to nucleotide sequence 1340–1360 (‘5-AGACAGC
AUGAGGAAGCGAdTdT-3’), present in a region in
the C-terminus of LEDGF/p75 that is not shared by its
short alternative splice variant LEDGF/p52. Cells were
transfected with 100 nM siRNAs using Oligofectamine
(Life Technologies) following manufacturer’s instruction.
A scrambled siRNA duplex (siSD, Darmacon) was used as
a negative control.
