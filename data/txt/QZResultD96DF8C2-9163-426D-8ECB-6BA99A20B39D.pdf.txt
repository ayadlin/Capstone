Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy that is
generally refractory to chemotherapy, thus posing experimental and clinical challenges. In this study, the antiproliferative
effect of the triterpenoid compound cucurbitacin B was tested
in vitro and in vivo against human pancreatic cancer cells.
Dose-response studies showed that the drug inhibited 50%
growth of seven pancreatic cancer cell lines at 10 7 mol/L,
whereas clonogenic growth was significantly inhibited at
5  10 8 mol/L. Cucurbitacin B caused dose- and timedependent G2-M-phase arrest and apoptosis of pancreatic
cancer cells. This was associated with inhibition of activated
JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5, increased level of p21WAF1 even in
cells with nonfunctional p53, and decrease of expression of
cyclin A, cyclin B1, and Bcl-XL with subsequent activation
of the caspase cascade. Interestingly, the combination of
cucurbitacin B and gemcitabine synergistically potentiated
the antiproliferative effects of gemcitabine on pancreatic
cancer cells. Moreover, cucurbitacin B decreased the volume
of pancreatic tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice by 69.2%
(P < 0.01) compared with controls without noticeable drug
toxicities. In vivo activation of JAK2/STAT3 was inhibited and
expression of Bcl-XL was decreased, whereas caspase-3 and
caspase-9 were up-regulated in tumors of drug-treated mice.
In conclusion, we showed for the first time that cucurbitacin B
has profound in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative effects
against human pancreatic cancer cells, and the compound
may potentate the antiproliferative effect of the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine. Further clinical studies are
necessary to confirm our findings in patients with pancreatic
cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5876–84]

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is a severe health problem and a leading cause
of cancer-related deaths (1). Despite recent advances in the
understanding of the molecular biology of pancreatic cancer, the

annual incidence still is almost identical to the mortality rate. The
low survival rate is due to insensitivity of pancreatic cancer to most
therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy (1, 2). The single-agent gemcitabine is known to be an
acceptable standard in advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer,
but the benefit is small. Even the addition of other chemotherapeutics or monoclonal antibodies with gemcitabine has not
resulted in a meaningful improvement in survival of pancreatic
cancer patients (2).
Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) belong
to a family of transcription factors that relay cytokine receptorgenerated signals into the nucleus. The phosphorylation of Janus
kinases (JAK) via the activation of cytokine receptors creates
receptor docking sites for recruitment of cytoplasmic STAT
proteins. Additionally, activation of STAT signaling is also
modulated by several growth factors such as epidermal growth
factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and platelet-derived growth
factor. The activated STATs translocate to the nucleus in a dimer
form, bind to specific DNA response elements, and finally modulate
cell growth and differentiation (3, 4). Recent studies showed
aberrant signaling of the JAK/STAT pathway in pancreatic cancer
(4, 5), which therefore may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for
this type of aggressive cancer.
Biochemists and biologists have been investigating a variety of
purified compounds from herbs as possible sources of new
anticancer drugs. Naturally occurring cucurbitacins constitute a
group of oxygenated triterpenes, which are characterized by the
tetracyclic cucurbitane nucleus skeleton and present in many
plants as h-glucosides. Cucurbitacin B, a member of the
cucurbitacins, is extracted from Trichosanthes kirilowii Maximowicz (Cucurbitaceae family), a plant that has long been used in
oriental medicine for its anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and
abortifacient effects. This active ingredient has antiproliferative
effects on several types of malignancies and is known to be an
dual inhibitor of the activation of both JAK2 and STAT3 in some
malignancies (3). Recently, we were able to show that cucurbitacin B has antiproliferative activity against human breast cancer,
glioblastoma multiforme, and myeloid leukemia cells (6–8).
In the present study, we show that cucurbitacin B markedly
inhibits the proliferation of seven human pancreatic cancer cell
lines. The growth-inhibitory effects of this compound were
associated with a significant G2-M-phase arrest and increase in
apoptosis by inhibition of JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5 and subsequent
activation of the caspase cascade. Moreover, the compound
significantly potentiated the antiproliferative effects of gemcitabine
on pancreatic cancer cells. We further confirmed our in vitro

observations by showing profound antitumor activity of cucurbitacin B in a murine xenograft model with no apparent toxicity to
the animals.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and compounds. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Monolayer cultures
of MiaPaCa-2, PL45, and Panc-1 were maintained in DMEM (Life
Technologies), SU86.86 and AsPC-1 were maintained in RPMI 1640, and
Panc-03.27 and Panc-10.05 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium
bicarbonate, 4.5 g/L glucose, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1.0 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate, and 10 units/mL human insulin. Heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (10%, v/v; Gemini Bio-Products) was added to all cell cultures, and
they were maintained at 37jC in a humidified chamber of 95% air and 5%
CO2. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells growing as a monolayer were
detached from the flask surface using 2.5% trypsin-EDTA solution. Cell
counts were determined using a hemocytometer (Allegiance Healthcare),
and only cells in the logarithmic phase of growth were used for all studies.
In this study, we used highly purified cucurbitacin B (CKBP002;
molecular weight 558.7; C32H46O8; Fig. 1) synthesized by CK Life Sciences
Int’l. CKBP002 consists of cucurbitacin B with >99% purity as confirmed by
high-performance liquid chromatography (data provided on request by CK
Life Sciences Int’l.). The drug was dissolved in DMSO at a stock
concentration of 10 2 mol/L and stored at 20jC.
Gemcitabine (Gemzar; Eli Lilly) was stored at 4jC and dissolved in sterile
PBS on the day of use.
Measurement of cellular proliferation and colony count. For
measurement of proliferation, the seven human pancreatic cancer cell
lines were placed into 96-well plates at 104 cells per well (100 AL) and
treated with either diluent control (DMSO) or various concentrations of
cucurbitacin B (10 9-10 6 mol/L). The cells were incubated at 37jC for
96 h, a time point selected as it was previously determined to be optimal for
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays
(9). MTT (10 AL; 5 mg/mL; Sigma) dissolved in PBS was added to each well
followed by 100 AL of 20% SDS after 4 h. The absorbance of the product was
measured with an ELISA reader at 540 nm after 16 more hours. The
obtained values of 50% effective dose were expressed as the concentrations
that corresponded to a reduction of cellular growth by 50% when compared
with values of the diluent control cells.
For pulse-exposure experiments, all seven human pancreatic cancer cell
lines were exposed to cucurbitacin B (10 7 mol/L) for either 2, 9, or 20 h,
washed with culture medium, and cultured again in cucurbitacin B-free
medium. After an additional 1, 2, and 3 days, MTT assay was done as
described above. To examine if cucurbitacin B treatment influences
the ploidy in pancreatic cancer cell lines, cells were drug-treated for
9 h (10 7 mol/L) and incubated for an additional 24 h in drug-free medium.

After being trypsinized and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, the cells were
fixed in 70% methanol overnight. The fixed samples were treated with
RNase A, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry
(FACScan; Becton Dickinson) with the ModFitLT V2.0 software (Verity).
For clonogenic assays, three pancreatic cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa-2,
PL45, and Panc-1) were plated into 24-well plates using a two-layer soft agar
system with a total of 3  103 cells per well in a volume of 400 AL/well as
described previously (10). After 10 days of incubation with different
concentrations of cucurbitacin B (10 9 10 7 mol/L), the colonies were
counted.
Cell cycle analysis and measurement of apoptosis. Two pancreatic
cancer cell lines (105 cells; Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2) were analyzed for
alterations in their cell cycle after treating the cells for 24, 48, and 72 h with
cucurbitacin B (5  10 8 and 10 7 mol/L). After the cells were fixed in 70%
methanol, the samples were treated with RNase A and exposed to
propidium iodide for analysis by flow cytometry.
We used the Annexin V assay (Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit;
BD Pharmingen) for the measurement of cellular apoptosis. The pancreatic
cancer cell lines Panc-1, MiaPaCa-2, and PL45 (105 cells) were cultured with
cucurbitacin B (2  10 7 mol/L) for either 24, 48, 72, or 96 h. Annexin VFITC and propidium iodide labeling followed, which was done according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Percentage of apoptosis in both diluent
control and cucurbitacin B-treated cells was analyzed by flow cytometry.
Western blotting. Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells with a known p53
mutation were harvested for Western blotting, and proteins were extracted
with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)] containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein lysates
(50 Ag) were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories),
resolved by electrophoresis on 4% to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were
probed with antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology as well as Santa
Cruz Biotechnology and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence
kit (Pierce), whereas GAPDH was used as a control. All antibodies that were
used in this study can be found in Supplementary Table S1.
Murine xenograft model and tumor treatment. The in vivo behavior
of pancreatic cancers was investigated in a murine xenograft model. All
animal experiments were in accordance with the guidelines of CedarsSinai Research Institute and the NIH. Five-week-old female nu/nu athymic
mice (weight 20-22 g; specific pathogen-free) from Harlan Sprague-Dawley
were maintained in pathogen-free conditions and fed irradiated chow.
Mice (5 per cohort) were randomly assigned to either treatment group
(mean weight 21.1 g) or control group (mean weight 20.9 g). Panc-1 cells
(107) in 0.2 mL Matrigel (Basement Membrane Matrix, High Concentration;
BD Biosciences) were injected subcutaneously in both flanks of the nude
mice. Because each mouse had two tumors, every group consisted of
10 tumors. Treatment was started the day after cell implantation with
either 1 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneal injections of cucurbitacin B
three times a week (treatment group) or diluent control (DMSO) alone
(control group). We showed previously that this concentration of the drug
and frequency of administration were safe for mice (6). Cucurbitacin B was
dissolved in 5% DMSO and administered to the mice in a volume of
0.1 mL. Tumors were measured with Vernier calipers every 3 days and
volume was calculated as described previously using the following
formula: (length  width  depth)  0.5236 (11). Each mouse was
weighed twice per week. After 48 days of treatment, the experiment was
halted due to excessive tumor volume in the control group. We weighed
the dissected tumors, fixed them in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, and
embed these tumors them in paraffin wax. Inhibition rate of tumor growth
was calculated using the following formula: tumor growth inhibition rate
(%) = (1 - M T / M C)  100, where M T and M C are the mean normalized
tumor masses of treatment and control groups, respectively (12).
Metastatic disease was determined macroscopically at autopsy in all
thoracic, abdominal, retroperitoneal, and pelvic organs followed by
histologic examination. At sacrifice, tumors were harvested from mice,
and a portion of each tumor was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -80jC until analysis. Tumor tissue homogenates were prepared in SDS

Statistical analysis. All in vitro experiments were repeated at least three
times to confirm the results, and data were expressed as the mean F SD.
Statistical significance was determined with Student’s t test (two-tailed)
when comparing two groups of data set. P values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. Asterisks shown in the figures indicate significant
differences of experimental groups in comparison with the corresponding
control condition (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01).
Drug synergy was determined by the isobologram and combination index
(CI) methods (CalcuSyn software, version 1.1.1 1996; Biosoft) derived from
the median-effect principle of Chou and Talalay (14, 15). The isobologram
method is a graphical representation of the pharmacologic interaction and
is formed by selecting a desired fractional cell kill and plotting the required
individual drug doses on their respective x and y axes. A straight line is then
drawn to connect the points. The observed dose combination of the two
agents that achieved that particular fractional cell kill is then plotted on the

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

isobologram. Combination data points that fall on the line represent an
additive drug-drug interaction, whereas data points that fall below or above
the line represent either synergism or antagonism, respectively. The CI
method is a mathematical and quantitative representation of a two-drug
pharmacologic interaction. Using data from the growth-inhibitory experiments and computerized software, CI values are generated over a range of
Fa levels from 0.05 to 0.90 (5-90% growth inhibition). A CI of 1 indicates an
additive effect between two agents, whereas a CI < 1 or CI > 1 indicates
synergism or antagonism, respectively.

Results
Cucurbitacin B inhibits proliferation of pancreatic cancer
cells and causes multinucleation. We tested the ability of
cucurbitacin B to inhibit the proliferation of a panel of seven
pancreatic cancer cell lines via the MTT assay: MiaPaCa-2, PL45,

Panc-1, and AsPC-1 (Fig. 2A) as well as SU86.86, Panc-03.27, and
Panc-10.05 (data not shown). Each had a fairly similar sensitivity to
the compound with an inhibition of 50% growth at 10 7 mol/L. We
also examined the antiproliferative activity of the seven malignant
cell lines when pulse-exposed to cucurbitacin B (10 7 mol/L) for
either 2, 9, or 20 h, washed, and grown in liquid culture in the
absence of cucurbitacin B for an additional 1, 2, or 3 days. A
significant decrease in proliferation of the pancreatic cancer cells
occurred after exposure for either 9 or 20 h to the drug compared
with the diluent-exposed control cells (Fig. 2B; representative data
shown for MiaPaCa-2). The pancreatic cancer cell lines underwent
rapid morphologic changes within <1 h after exposure to
cucurbitacin B, rounding up and losing their pseudopodia
(Fig. 2C). Reexamining the cells after growing in normal culture
medium, the cells reverted to their regular morphology within

24 h after pulse exposure, suggesting that the alterations mediated
by 1 h of exposure to cucurbitacin B were reversible. Interestingly,
the pulse-exposure treatment for either 9 or 20 h with 10 7 mol/L
cucurbitacin B caused prominent multinucleation of the cells after
they were washed and recultured in normal medium for an
additional 24 h (Fig. 2C). After 9 h of exposure of MiaPaCa-2 and
Panc-1 cell lines to 10 7 mol/L cucurbitacin B followed by 24 h of
culture in drug-free medium, a mean of 38 F 7% cells developed
tetraploidy (62 F 7% diploidy) compared with 4 F 2% in untreated
cells (96 F 2% diploidy; Fig. 2D).
Cucurbitacin B inhibits clonogenic growth, produces cell
cycle arrest, and increases apoptosis of pancreatic cancer
cells. Clonogenic assay relies on individual colony-forming cells to
proliferate actively in soft gel culture to form a colony of cells.

cytometry after exposure to cucurbitacin B

and 72 h. C, apoptosis was measured by

(MiaPaCa-2, PL45, and Panc-1) after
treatment with 2  10 7 mol/L cucurbitacin
B for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.

were cultured in soft agar either with or without cucurbitacin B,
clonal growth was inhibited significantly by the drug in a dosedependent fashion compared with the control cells. Cucurbitacin B
at 5  10 8 mol/L inhibited >80% of the clonogenic pancreatic
cancer cells (Fig. 3A).
The affect of cucurbitacin B on the cell cycle was studied by flow
cytometry using MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cell lines.
The compound caused a time- and dose-dependent growth arrest
in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 3B; representative data for
MiaPaCa-2 shown). After 72 h of drug exposure (2  10 7 mol/L),
the percentage of cells in the G2-M phase increased up to 5-fold in
the treated cell lines compared with the controls.
Further, the ability of cucurbitacin B (10 7 mol/L) to induce
apoptosis was measured by Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide
labeling of pancreatic cancer cells. A total of 76 F 4% (MiaPaCa-2),
85 F 4.5% (PL45), and 71 F 4% (Panc-1), respectively, of the
pancreatic cancer cells were apoptotic after 96 h of drug exposure,
whereas only 12 F 2% (MiaPaCa-2), 12.8 F 2.3% (PL45), and 10 F
1% (Panc-1), respectively, of diluent treated control cells had
undergone apoptosis (Fig. 3C).
Cucurbitacin B profoundly inhibits JAK/STAT pathway with
activation of caspase cascade. The JAK/STAT pathway plays an
important role in cell growth, proliferation, and survival, and it has
been implicated in many human cancers (16, 17). We tested the
ability of cucurbitacin B to modulate the expression of these
proteins. Serum-starved Panc-1 cells with mutant p53 expressed
high levels of activated JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5 in response to
interleukin-6 treatment (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the activation of
JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5 was markedly inhibited by 4 h treatment
with cucurbitacin B (5  10 8 mol/L). The RAS/RAF/ERK and PI3K/
AKT signaling pathways were not down-regulated by the compound. Activation of AKT and JNK was not affected (data not
shown), whereas phosphorylated ERK was up-regulated by drug
treatment (Fig. 4A). We further examined the expression of
proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptotic pathways,
which are known to be connected to the JAK/STAT pathway. Cyclin

kinase inhibitor p21WAF1 , which is associated with cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis (18), was increased in a time-dependent manner,
and the cell cycle regulators cyclin A and cyclin B1 decreased after
24 h exposure to cucurbitacin B (Fig. 4B). The drug also decreased
the protein level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL protein and increased
the proapoptotic caspase-3 and caspase-9 enzyme levels associated
with PARP cleavage over 24 h. The protein expression of the cell
cycle inhibitor p27 (CDKN1B) as well as cyclin D1 were not altered
by the drug treatment (data not shown).
Cucurbitacin B synergistically potentiates the antiproliferative effects of gemcitabine. The growth of MiaPaCa-2 and Panc1 cells treated with cucurbitacin B (10 8, 5  10 8, and 10 7 mol/L),
gemcitabine (10 9 and 10 8 mol/L), or a combination of both was
determined by MTT assay. The dose in this study was chosen
based on a preliminary dose-escalation study (data not show). We
observed no significant combinatory effects in growth inhibition
when using either cucurbitacin B 10 8 or 5  10 8 mol/L together
with gemcitabine 10 9 mol/L (treatments 1 and 2, respectively;
Fig. 5). In contrast, a significant reduction in growth was observed in both cell lines treated in a combination of cucurbitacin
B 10 7 mol/L with gemcitabine 10 9 mol/L (treatment 3) as well
as in combination of cucurbitacin B 10 8, 5  10 8, or 10 7 mol/L
together with 10 8 mol/L gemcitabine (treatments 4-6, respectively;
P < 0.01; Fig. 5). With these latter combinations, the CI was <0.9
in both cell lines, which means that the two drugs have a synergistic
activity.
Cucurbitacin B markedly decreases growth of Panc-1
human pancreatic tumor xenografts in vivo. We also determined whether cucurbitacin B administration can suppress the
growth of human pancreatic tumor xenografts in vivo. Panc-1
pancreatic tumor cells were subcutaneously implanted in athymic
nude mice, and the experimental mice were given 1 mg/kg
cucurbitacin B intraperitoneally 3 days a week. The experiment
ended on day 48 due to excessive tumor size in the diluent-treated
control group. Growth of the tumors was significantly inhibited in
the mice treated with cucurbitacin B compared with the growth of

tumors in control mice (Fig. 6A). At the conclusion of the study, the
mean tumor volume in the diluent treated control mice was 1.8 F
0.24 cm3 compared with 0.51 F 0.14 cm3 in the cucurbitacin
B-treated mice (69.2% decrease; P < 0.01; Fig. 6B). The overall
tumor weight of the control group was 19.4 F 2.12 g, whereas it
was only 3.96 F 0.61 g for the mice that received cucurbitacin B
treatment (P < 0.01; Fig. 6C). Furthermore, no metastases were
found in the cucurbitacin B-treated group, whereas the control
cohort showed additional metastatic spread in the axillary lymph
nodes, mediastinum, liver, and peritoneum, which was confirmed
by histologic examination of suspected lesions. Treatment with
cucurbitacin B was without apparent ill consequences for the mice
such as altered weight, signs of discomfort, or impaired movement
(data not shown). Concordantly with our in vitro results, tumors of
mice treated with cucurbitacin B had lower levels of activated
STAT3, JAK2, and the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-XL and higher

expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 compared with the tumors
from the control mice (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
In 1997, a randomized phase III study of gemcitabine versus
5-fluorouracil showed a statistically significant clinical benefit of
gemcitabine compared with 5-fluorouracil (19). The 1-year survival
rate of patients with pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine
was 18% versus 2% with 5-fluorouracil. Since that time, the
nucleoside analogue gemcitabine has become standard chemotherapy for locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Limited progress has been achieved despite intense research using
combinatorial treatments with chemotherapy agents, often along
with the use of biological agents targeting activated molecular
pathways involved in pancreatic cancer. For instance, erlotinib, an

oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the epidermal
growth factor receptor, was recently tested in combination with
gemcitabine (20). However, due to a small improvement in median
survival and the resultant toxicity, the clinical benefit of this
combination remains unclear. Moreover, agents inhibiting vascular
endothelial growth factor pathways have been largely disappointing as primary therapy. For example, bevacizumab in combination
with gemcitabine in a randomized phase III clinical trial as well as
sorafenib in a small pilot study have both failed to show superiority
over gemcitabine monotherapy (21, 22). Patients with refractory
advanced pancreatic cancer have had a benefit from salvage
chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin-based regimens
(23, 24).
However, many new insights in the molecular alterations and
their prognostic significance concerning pancreatic cancer have
been made over the last years. Recently, studies provided evidence
that the JAK/STAT3 pathway, which is well known to play a major
role in many types of cancers, may enhance proliferation of
pancreatic cancer. This pathway is often constitutively activated in
subsets of human pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines (4, 5).
Moreover, specific inhibitors of JAK2 and/or STAT3 decrease
growth of pancreatic cancer cell lines. STAT5 is also known to be
active in a variety of malignancies such as breast and prostate
cancer, leukemias, and myeloproliferative disorders (25, 26).
In this study, we provide strong evidence that cucurbitacin B has
a marked antiproliferative effect on pancreatic cancer at least in
part by the inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This
compound inhibited the activation of JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5.

Downstream targets of the JAK/STAT pathway, which are
responsible for generating pro-proliferative signals via cell cycle
modulation and up-regulate antiapoptotic proteins, were also
affected. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1 , which acts as
a negative cell cycle regulator, was up-regulated; and cyclin A and
cyclin B1 were down-regulated by cucurbitacin B treatment. This
resulted in a dose- and time-dependent G2-M cell cycle arrest in
drug-treated pancreatic cancer cells. In general, about half of
human cancers have p53 mutations resulting in the inability of this
protein to induce expression of p21WAF1 (27, 28). However, p21WAF1
not only mediates growth arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA
damage but may also be responsible in a p53-independent way for
the antiproliferative effects of certain growth inhibitory stimuli,
such as transforming growth factor-b (29), mimosine (30), okadaic
acid, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (31), and several differentiating agents (32). Because Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells
have p53 mutations, cucurbitacin B is able to up-regulate
expression of p21WAF1 independent of p53. This is relevant because
p53 mutations have been found in 40% to 76% of pancreatic cancer
tissues (28).
Pulse-exposure experiments showed that only 9 h exposure to
10 7 mol/L cucurbitacin B inhibited growth of up to 81%
pancreatic cancer cells. Additionally, these cells showed prominent
multinucleation with high levels of tetraploidy, one important sign
of failed mitosis, even after cells were reexposed to drug-free
medium. Interestingly, after a very brief exposure (<1 h) to
cucurbitacin B, the pancreatic cancer cells became round and
refractile. These morphologic changes are similar to changes we

Cucurbitacin B Induces Apoptosis in Pancreatic Cancer

noted in studies with cucurbitacin B on human breast cancer and
glioblastoma cell lines (6, 7). In those two studies, we showed by
confocal microscopy that the drug disrupted the cytoskeletal
architecture including F-actin, whereas the spindle microtubules
were still functional.
Bcl-XL plays a vital role in pancreatic cancer chemoresistance,
and the increased expression of this antiapoptotic protein is
associated with poor survival in this type of cancer (33, 34).
Cucurbitacin B was markedly able to decrease Bcl-XL expression in
pancreatic cancer cells and activate the caspase cascade as another
important downstream target of JAK/STAT signaling. The activity of
caspase family members 3 and 9 were up-regulated by cucurbitacin
B treatment with subsequent cleavage of PARP protein. This
activation was associated with increased levels of apoptosis in
the pancreatic cancer cell lines. The RAS/RAF/ERK and PI3K/AKT
pathways were not inhibited by cucurbitacin B, suggesting that
these signaling pathways are not important for growth inhibition
or apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells by the drug.
Pancreatic cancer is poorly treated by conventional therapies
including gemcitabine, whereas aberrant activation of the STAT
pathway is able to confer resistance to radiation and chemotherapies (35, 36). The ability of cucurbitacin B to potentiate
gemcitabine is notable. Strikingly, the drug at 10 8 mol/L
synergistically augmented the antiproliferative effect of gemcitabine. However, further in vivo studies are warranted to confirm
these findings.
The cucurbitacins as unpurified molecules have been used for
centuries as folk medicine in countries such as China and India
without any clear toxicity (37). They have been used because of
their anti-inflammatory analgesic effects. We showed that administration of purified cucurbitacin B to athymic nude mice with
human pancreatic cancer xenografts significantly retarded tumor
growth. In agreement with our in vitro observations, tumors from
these mice had decreased expression of activated JAK2 and STAT3
compared with controls. The enhanced expression of the
antiapoptotic gene Bcl-XL in pancreatic cancer and its association

with shorter patient survival suggests that this protein may
enhance the viability of pancreatic cancer cells in vivo. Interestingly, we found that cucurbitacin B inhibited the in vivo expression
of Bcl-XL with increased activity of the proapoptotic caspases.
Regarding in vivo toxicity, the cucurbitacin B-treated mice
tolerated the therapy with no signs of toxicity including no
significant change in body weight. This is similar to our previous
study of administration of cucurbitacin B to mice having human
breast cancer xenografts (6). These mice also received intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg/kg cucurbitacin B three times a week with
no apparent side effects.
In the present study, we show for the first time that cucurbitacin
B has profound antipancreatic cancer activity in vitro and in vivo.
The drug induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in pancreatic
cancer cell lines by inhibiting the JAKT/STAT pathway, increasing
the expression of p21WAF1 independently of p53 activity, and
inducing the caspase cascade. The drug also potentiates the
proliferative activity of the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine. Our
studies provide a rationale for the development of cucurbitacin B
as a therapeutic agent against human pancreatic cancer.
