Abstract
Overexpression of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells occurs
widely in patients with multiple myeloma, but the pathophysiologic effects of GDF15 in this setting remain
undeﬁned. GDF15 has been described in numerous solid tumors but never in hematologic malignancies. In this
study, we report that GDF15 signiﬁcantly increases survival of stroma-dependent multiple myeloma cells
including primary multiple myeloma cells. In particular, GDF15 conferred resistance to melphalan, bortezomib,
and to a lesser extent, lenalidomide in both stroma-dependent and stroma-independent multiple myeloma cells.
Akt-dependent signaling was critical to mediate the effects of GDF15, whereas Src and extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways were not involved. Given these results, we tested the clinical signiﬁcance
of plasma concentrations of GDF15 (pGDF15) in 131 patients with multiple myeloma and found that it correlated
with disease prognosis. Speciﬁcally, patients with high levels of pGDF15 had lower probabilities of event-free
and overall survival 30 months after diagnosis than patients with low pGDF15 levels. Our ﬁndings suggest that
tumor microenvironment-derived GDF15 is a key survival and chemoprotective factor for multiple myeloma
cells, which is pathophysiologically linked to both initial parameters of the disease as well as patient survival.

Introduction
Multiple myeloma is a clonal plasma cell malignant disease
that accounts for 13% of hematologic cancers (1). The disease is
fatal and the median survival is 5 years (2), but this survival has
signiﬁcantly increased with the introduction of novel therapies, (3) with some patients surviving more than 10 years (4).
Prognostic factors reﬂecting tumor burden, tumor damage in
organs and tissues, and intrinsic characteristics including
genetic abnormalities have been described, but so far, none
of these speciﬁcally reﬂect the multiple myeloma microenvironment (5–12).

Nevertheless, multiple myeloma has been a prototypic disease model for the study of interactions between the microenvironment and malignant cells (13) and has led to the
development of novel drugs such as immunomodulatory drugs
and proteasome inhibitors, which target not only multiple
myeloma cells but also their microenvironment (14). A better
understanding of the mechanism by which the multiple myeloma microenvironment affects the disease is still required to
deﬁne new therapeutic targets.
Multiple myeloma cells proliferate in close contact with cells
from the bone marrow microenvironment. Bone marrowmesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) are the only long lived
cells of the bone marrow microenvironment. They secrete
survival factors for multiple myeloma cells and cytokines that
promote osteoclastogenesis and angiogenesis (15–18). Abnormalities of BM-MSCs have recently been reported (19–21). In
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, we reported
that BM-MSCs grown without multiple myeloma cells had an
abnormal gene expression proﬁle: 145 genes were differentially
expressed between BM-MSCs from patients with multiple
myeloma and normal subjects. In particular, we found that
growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) was increased in BMMSCs from patients with multiple myeloma (21).
GDF15 is a 40-kDa propeptide that is cleaved to release a
25-kDa circulating protein (22). It was ﬁrst described as a
divergent member of the human TGF-b superfamily (23).
GDF15 has a broad activity, as indicated by the diversity of

the nomenclature (MIC-1, PTGF-b, PLAB, PDF, NAG-1, and
PL74). In healthy subjects, GDF15 is highly expressed in the
placenta, with serum concentration increasing during pregnancy (24, 25). GDF15 concentration is notably increased in the
serum of patients with glioma, prostate, colorectal, or pancreatic cancer (26–29), and the factor was recently described as
belonging to a series of 20 biomarkers that best deﬁne the
malignant phenotype of numerous tumors (30). Understanding
the biologic role of GDF15 in cancer growth is challenging.
Some studies have documented its protumorigenic role
(26, 28–32) and others have shown antitumorigenic activity
(22, 33, 34). The role of GDF15 in hematologic malignancies has
not yet been documented.
To determine the potential impact of GDF15 overexpression
by BM-MSCs from patients with multiple myeloma, we
assessed the bioactivity of GDF15 on multiple myeloma cells
under serum-free culture conditions. We sought correlates of
plasma concentration of GDF15 (pGDF15) in patients with
multiple myeloma with biologic and clinical parameters of the
disease. We found that GDF15 is a survival and chemoprotective factor for multiple myeloma cells and show correlates of
pGDF15 to initial parameters of the disease and to patient
survival.

Cell survival. MOLP-6, MM1.S, and primary multiple myeloma cells were plated at 50  103 cells per mL with 0, 10, 100, or
200 ng/mL recombinant human GDF15 (R&D systems). Cells
were grown at 37 C and 5% CO2. At day 1 of culture, viable cells
were counted by Trypan blue exclusion assay. In a separate set
of experiments, MOLP-6 cells were pretreated overnight with
an Akt-1/2 inhibitor (124018) at 1 mmol/L (Merck) before
adding 200 ng/mL GDF15 for 24 hours.
Chemoprotection assay. MOLP-6 and MM1.S cells were
plated at 50  103 cells per mL with or without 200 ng/mL
GDF15 for 24 hours. Cells were grown at 37 C and 5% CO2. The
following drugs were added to the cell cultures for 1 day: 8
mmol/L melphalan (Sigma), 8 nmol/L bortezomib (Millennium
Pharmaceuticals), or 100 mmol/L lenalidomide (Celgene).
Appropriate controls (cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or
buffer alone) were included. In a separate set of experiments,
both multiple myeloma cell lines were pretreated overnight
with an Akt-1/2 inhibitor (124018) at 1 mmol/L before applying
the above mentioned procedure. Viable cells were counted by
Trypan blue exclusion assay. Percentage cell survival in cells
pretreated with GDF15  Akti versus nonpretreated cells was
obtained, and percentage of control cell survival (without Akti
or GDF15 pretreatment and without any drugs) was then
calculated.

Materials and Methods

Akt phosphorylation
MOLP-6, MM1.S, and primary multiple myeloma cells were
treated with 20 ng/mL GDF15 (R&D systems) or 50 ng/mL
recombinant human interleukin 6 (IL-6; R&D systems) in
serum-free medium for 15 minutes (a set of experiments was
carried out in 10% calf serum conditions). Cells were ﬁxed for
15 minutes, washed, permeabilized for 30 minutes with use of
an intracellular stain kit (BD Pharmingen) and stained with a
phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-pT308 or S473 Akt mAb
(BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes. Akt phosphorylation was
detected by ﬂow cytometry (EPICS XL-MCL; Beckman Coulter). Live cells, which could be clearly distinguished in forward
versus sideways scatter plots, were gated, and the median
ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) was determined. Fold changes of
MFI for each condition were deﬁned as the fraction (MFI of
measured sample)/(MFI of isotype control). A set of experiments with an Akt-1/2 inhibitor (124018, 1 mmol/L) was carried
out to verify inhibition of Akt phosphorylation.

Cell samples
The MOLP-6 stroma-dependent multiple myeloma cell
line was a generous gift from Dr. Harashima (ref. 35; Fujisaki
Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories) in 2007.
Cryopreserved MOLP-6 cells were defrosted and grown on
BM-MSCs in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum
and 10 mg/mL ciproﬂoxacin. BM-MSCs were obtained from
healthy bone marrow by culturing cells harvested from
ﬁlters used to remove ossicles and aggregates from the
allograft and prepared as previously described (21). The
MM1.S stroma-independent multiple myeloma cell line was
purchased from American Type Culture Collection in 2009.
Cryopreserved MM1.S cells were defrosted and grown at
37 C and 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal calf
serum and 10 mg/mL ciproﬂoxacin. These 2 multiple myeloma cell lines were tested and authenticated before starting
and during the study (morphologic analysis, immunophenotype, caryotype, stroma dependence, mycoplasma, and
EBV detection). Bone marrow from 4 patients with newly
diagnosed multiple myeloma was obtained by sternal puncture after patients gave their written informed consent.
Primary bone marrow myeloma cells were puriﬁed with use
of magnetic anti-human CD138 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec), and multiple myeloma BM-MSCs were obtained from
the CD138-negative fraction and prepared as previously
described (21).
Cell cultures
All culture experiments were carried out in Syn H serum-free
culture medium, an Iscove-based fully deﬁned culture medium
containing human albumin without insulin (ABCell-Bio;
ref. 12).

Bone marrow from 5 healthy individuals was obtained from the
remaining sample used for quality control during the preparation of allogeneic hematopoietic grafts. Bone marrow plasma
was obtained after centrifugation of bone marrow. The median
age of patients with multiple myeloma and healthy subjects
was 57  10 and 45  13 years, and the sex ratio (M:F) was 1.5
and 1.3, respectively.
Blood plasma. Peripheral blood plasma from 131
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma was
obtained after patients gave their written informed consent.
Patients' characteristics are in Table 1. The median age of
patients was 59  10 years, and the sex ratio (M:F) was 1.4.
These 131 patients were enrolled in different Intergroupe

conventional chemotherapy, including melphalan and prednisone, and 78 high-dose chemotherapy. Patients with Durie
Salmon disease stage I were symptomatic and thus treated.
Blood plasma from 13 healthy volunteers was also collected

and the sex ratio (M:F) was 1.2.
GDF15 measurement
Quantiﬁcation of GDF15 in supernatants and plasma
involved use of DuoSet ELISA for human GDF15 (R&D systems)
following the manufacturer's protocol. All samples were
assayed in duplicate. Intra-assay reproducibility was evaluated
in 3 independent experiments. Each assay involved 6 replicates
of 3 plasma samples containing low, median, and high values of
GDF15. The calculated overall intra-assay coefﬁcient of variation was 11%, 7%, and 7%, respectively. Interassay reproducibility was evaluated in 5 independent experiments. Each assay
involved a duplicate of the same 3 plasma samples containing
low, median, and high values of GDF15. The calculated overall
interassay coefﬁcient of variation was 15%, 4%, and 4%,
respectively.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of categorical variables was tested with
the c2 test or the Fisher exact test and that of continuous
variables with the Student t test, then Mann–Whitney U test.
All tests were 2 tailed. Correlation between pGDF15 level and
initial biologic parameters was tested by Spearman correlation.
A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Survival was evaluated for the 131 patients with multiple
myeloma by pGDF15 level. The threshold value of pGDF15 (0.50
ng/mL), deﬁning low and high levels, was deﬁned as mean þ 3
SD of pGDF15 of healthy subjects. The duration of event-free
survival (EFS) was calculated for all patients from the date of
diagnosis to the time of disease progression, relapse, or death.
Kaplan–Meier curves for EFS and overall survival (OS) were
plotted and compared by the log-rank test. Prognostic factors
for survival were determined by the Cox proportional hazards
model for univariate and multivariate analysis. As possible
prognostic factors, age, International Staging System (ISS;
ref. 7), b2-microglobulin level, hemoglobin level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and
presence or absence of deletion of chromosome 13 (del13) were
included in the regression model. For continuous variables,
classical cut-off values were selected.

Results
GDF15 increases survival of a stroma-dependent
multiple myeloma cell line and primary multiple
myeloma cells
We ﬁrst measured the survival of a stroma-dependent
(MOLP-6) and a stroma-independent (MM1.S) multiple myeloma cell lines and primary multiple myeloma cells under
serum-free conditions supplemented with titrated concentrations of GDF15. Without stromal cells, only 43.9%  3.1% of
MOLP-6 cells and 51.2%  5.8% of primary multiple myeloma
cells survived at day 1 of culture whereas 77.4%  10.2% of
MM1.S cells survived. GDF15 increased the MOLP-6 cell and
the primary multiple myeloma cells survival: 200 ng/mL
of GDF15 yielded up to 70.3%  5.6% viable MOLP-6
cells (P < 0.005) and 74.0%  5.9% viable primary multiple

activation of Akt (Supplementary Fig. S2). In primary multiple
myeloma cells, GDF15 induced T308 and, although to a lower
extent, S473 Akt phosphorylation (P < 0.05 and nonsigniﬁcant,
respectively), whereas IL-6 induced only T308 phosphorylation
(Fig. 2B). Therefore, GDF15 enhances Akt phosphorylation and
activity in MOLP-6 and primary multiple myeloma cells but not
MM1.S cells. Overnight pretreatment of MOLP-6 cells with an
Akt-1/2 inhibitor (124018, 1 mmol/L) inhibited GDF15-induced
p-Akt (Fig. 3A) and abrogated the GDF15-induced survival
increase (P < 0.05; Fig. 3B).
Of note, GDF15 did not induce phosphorylation of Src and
ERK1/2 in both multiple myeloma cell lines (Supplementary
Figs. S3 and S4).

cally used in multiple myeloma treatment. Dimethyl sulfoxide alone did not affect multiple myeloma cell survival (data
not shown). In drug-treated cultures, the proportion of
control MOLP-6 cell survival was increased when the cells
were pretreated with GDF15 (melphalan: 70.0%  10.1% vs.
48.8%  6.6%, P < 0.01; bortezomib: 91.0%  10.6% vs. 67.6%
 7.5%, P < 0.01; lenalidomide: 43.0%  7.6% vs. 31.1% 
3.8%, nonsigniﬁcant; Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained
with MM.1S cells (melphalan: 80.0%  24.3% vs. 30.0% 
6.7%, P < 0.01; bortezomib: 81.5%  17.5% vs. 54.0%  8.0%,
P < 0.05; lenalidomide: 20.7%  7.8% vs. 5.6%  1.4%,
nonsigniﬁcant; Fig. 4B). Thus, GDF15 decreases chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity of the 3 drugs in both multiple
myeloma cell lines. Overnight pretreatment of MOLP-6 cells
with an Akt-1/2 inhibitor (124018, 1 mmol/L) tended to
abrogate the GDF15-induced drug resistance (melphalan:
52.4%  5.7% vs. 70.0%  10.1%, P < 0.05; bortezomib: 69.4%

contrary, Akt-1/2 inhibitor had no signiﬁcant effect on the
GDF15-induced drug resistance for MM1.S cells (Fig. 4B).
GDF15 is not produced by multiple myeloma cells
themselves
Because GDF15 has been described to be produced by
tumors cells themselves in solid cancer, we measured simultaneously the concentration of GDF15 in supernatants of
primary BM-MSCs and multiple myeloma cells from 3 patients
with newly diagnosed myeloma. Whereas the concentration of
GDF15 ranged from 4  103 to 8  103 pg per cell for their
BM-MSCs, we did not detect any GDF15 in the corresponding
multiple myeloma cells supernatants. We found similar results
with both multiple myeloma cell lines, MOLP-6 and MM1.S
cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). Hence, GDF15 is a speciﬁc factor
of microenvironment in myeloma.
pGDF15 increases with multiple myeloma disease stage
Because GDF15 is oversecreted by BM-MSCs from patients
with multiple myeloma relative to healthy subjects (21) and
confers in vitro survival and chemoresistance to multiple
myeloma cells, we next wondered whether the concentration

1400

of GDF15 was also higher in bone marrow plasma from
patients with multiple myeloma than from healthy subjects.
We measured the concentration of GDF15 in bone marrow
plasma from patients with multiple myeloma (n ¼ 16) and
healthy subjects (n ¼ 5) and found it signiﬁcantly higher in
patients with multiple myeloma (0.95  0.92 ng/mL vs. 0.41 
0.19 ng/mL, P < 0.001). Among patients with multiple myeloma,
the mean concentration of GDF15 was signiﬁcantly higher
for the 9 patients with ISS stage II and III disease (1.26 
0.16 ng/mL) than for the 7 patients with stage I disease (0.57 
0.20 ng/mL, P < 0.001; Fig. 5A).
To study the concentration of GDF15 in a larger cohort of
subjects, and because blood samples are easier to collect than
bone marrow samples, we next measured the concentrations
of GDF15 in bone marrow and blood plasma in 24 patients with
multiple myeloma. We found a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.98
(Supplementary Fig. S6), so for the rest of the study, we tested
only blood plasma.
The pGDF15 was measured in blood from 131 additional
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and 13
healthy subjects. Demographic and clinical characteristics for
the patients with multiple myeloma are in Table 1. Mean

Prognostic factors of EFS
We analyzed the impact of prognostic factors (age, ISS
stage, b2-microglobulin level, hemoglobin level, LDH activity, CRP level, and presence or absence of del13) on EFS
for the 131 patients with multiple myeloma. On univariate
analysis, EFS was signiﬁcantly related to pGDF15 (P ¼ 0.003),
age (P ¼ 0.003), and b2-microglobulin level (P ¼ 0.02).
On multivariate analysis, EFS was related to only pGDF15
(P ¼ 0.04) and age (P ¼ 0.001).

Discussion
Our study shows that functionally GDF15 is a survival and
chemoprotective factor for multiple myeloma cells and that
clinically pGDF15 is related to initial parameters of the
disease and survival. This study provides new insights into
the mechanism by which the abnormal multiple myeloma
microenvironment affects the pathophysiology and the
prognosis of multiple myeloma. Here, we investigated the
signiﬁcance of one of multiple myeloma microenvironment
dysfunctions, the overexpression of GDF15 by BM-MSCs
(21). Although the overexpression of GDF15 has been
described in numerous solid malignancies (26, 29, 32, 37),

www.aacrjournals.org

its precise implication in tumors remains unknown. GDF15
may have different functions in cancer, such as being a
tumor suppressor during early oncogenesis but a promoter
at later stages (22, 38). GDF15 has never been studied in
hematologic malignancies.
Here, we ﬁrst determined the role of GDF15 on multiple
myeloma cell survival in vitro. This involved experiments under
serum-free conditions to avoid components present in serum,
in particular insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which might
confound interpretation of the results (12). GDF15 increased
cell survival in the MOLP-6 stroma-dependent multiple myeloma cell line, conﬁrming our previous work (21) but in more
stringent culture conditions. Moreover, GDF15 was able to
signiﬁcantly increase cell survival in primary multiple myeloma cells. Although these results contrast with GDF15-induced
apoptosis of prostate cancer cells (33), they are notably consistent with those of GDF15 supporting malignant glioma cell
proliferation (26). We previously reported that BM-MSCs from
patients with multiple myeloma induced an overgrowth of
MOLP-6 cells when compared with BM-MSCs from normal
subjects (21). To determine whether the overproduction of
GDF15 by multiple myeloma BM-MSCs is involved in this
overgrowth, we carried out MOLP-6 cells and multiple myeloma BM-MSCs coculture experiments involving MSCs from 4
patients with multiple myeloma that were transfected either
with a control plasmid or with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)targeting GDF15. The number of MOLP-6 cells after 7 days of
coculture was signiﬁcantly decreased (P < 0.05) when MSCs
were transfected with shRNA GDF15 (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Although this decrease is moderate, it suggests that the overproduction of GDF15 participates to the MOLP-6 overgrowth
we previously observed with multiple myeloma BM-MSCs. We
did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant survival advantage with GDF15 in
the MM1.S stroma-independent multiple myeloma cell line. Of
note, no overgrowth of stroma-independent cell line had been
observed with multiple myeloma BM-MSCs in our previous
work (21). Interestingly, GDF15 induced Akt phosphorylation
in MOLP-6 and primary multiple myeloma cells but not in
MM1.S cells. In addition, pretreating MOLP-6 cells with an
Akti-1/2 inhibitor abrogated GDF15-induced survival increase.
These results support the presence of an Akt-dependent
survival mechanism, which is consistent with the observation
from Kim and colleagues (31), who found that GDF15 activates
Akt signaling in human breast and gastric cancer cells. The
contribution of the Akt pathway to the growth of multiple
myeloma cells has been extensively studied (36, 39–41). Functionally, the Akt pathway is implicated in cell-cycle and apoptosis regulation in multiple myeloma cells. Akt is phosphorylated in bone marrow biopsies from patients with multiple
myeloma, notably because of bone marrow microenvironment-derived cytokines such as IL-6 or IGF-1 (42). Our data
indicate that GDF15 also contribute to triggering the Akt
pathway in multiple myeloma cells. The absence of IL-6 effect
on Akt signaling in MOLP-6 cells was expected as IL-6 has no
bioactivity on their survival (35). Its marginal effect in primary
multiple myeloma cells in our serum-free conditions is due to
the fact that the bioactivity of this cytokine is highly dependent
on IGF-1 presence (12). The lack of signiﬁcant effect of IL-6 and

Corre et al.

GDF15 on MM1.S stroma-independent cells survival reﬂects
constitutive activation of Akt (41). Apart from Akt, GDF15 has
been described to activate ERK1/2 in a SNU-216 gastric cancer
cells (31) and Src in SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells (43). In our
culture conditions, GDF15 could not induce phosphorylation
of ERK1/2 in both multiple myeloma cell lines, suggesting that
the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway would not be involved. In
addition, GDF15 had no bioactivity on Src in MOLP-6 and
MM1.S cells.
GDF15 conferred drug resistance in MOLP-6 and MM1.S
cells to 3 drugs classically used in multiple myeloma treatment (melphalan, bortezomib and, to a lower extent, lenalidomide). These data are consistent with previous observations (44) showing that GDF15 protects prostate cancer cells
against the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel and mitoxantrone.
Because the GDF15-mediated chemoprotection of MOLP-6
cells was abrogated when the cells were pretreated with an
Akti-1/2 inhibitor, we suggest the presence of an Akt-dependent chemoprotection mechanism. For MM1.S cell line, this
effect might be Akt independent. Other signaling cascades
activated by cytokines or growth factors in multiple myeloma cells may be involved, including Janus-activated kinase
(JAK)/Stat3, Wnt, NF-kB pathways (1, 14), and underlying
other cellular processes that might inﬂuence chemoresistance (drug efﬂux, cell death, genotoxic sensing, DNA repair,
proteasome activity). The differences of biologic proﬁle
between MOLP-6 and MM1.S cells and the similarities
between MOLP-6 and primary multiple myeloma cells pinpoint the importance of the stroma dependence of multiple
myeloma cell lines chosen as in vitro models to study the
impact of microenvironment on tumor.
We next showed that GDF15 is increased in bone marrow
plasma from patients with multiple myeloma. Although our
previous studies indicated that this increase reﬂected GDF15
overproduction by multiple myeloma BM-MSCs, macrophages might also contribute to total GDF15 level. Macrophages are able to secrete GDF15 (23) and constitute abundant components of multiple myeloma microenvironment
and able to protect multiple myeloma cells against druginduced apoptosis (45). However, as compared with its
production in solid tumors, GDF15 is not produced by the
malignant multiple myeloma cells themselves but speciﬁcally by their microenvironment.
Although GDF15 has been described in many solid
tumors, a lot remains to be uncovered on its biology; in
particular GDF15 receptor is still unknown today. There is
some evidence for SMAD pathway activation, suggesting
GDF15 may act through a TGF-b superfamily (46). A recent
study identiﬁed GDF15 as an acute-phase modiﬁer of CCR2/
TGF-bRII–dependent inﬂammatory responses to vascular
injury (47). On the other side, Kim and colleagues elegantly
showed that GDF15 induces the transactivation of ErbB2
tyrosine kinase in SK-BR-3 breast and SNU-216 gastric
cancer cells (31). We did not ﬁnd any expression of TGFbRII or ErbB2 on both multiple myeloma cell lines and
primary multiple myeloma cells (data not shown), suggesting that GDF15 receptor also remains to be discovered in
multiple myeloma.

Cancer Res; 72(6) March 15, 2012

To determine whether the GDF15 concentration level
increase was indicative of the severity of the disease in
patients with multiple myeloma, and because we found that
the concentrations of GDF15 in bone marrow and blood
plasma in 24 patients with multiple myeloma were correlated, we next measured the pGDF15 in 131 patients with
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The pGDF15 level
increase was correlated with prognosis, as was reported for
patients with prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers
(27, 28, 48). Finally, we found a strong relation between
pGDF15 level and survival to 30 months in patients with
multiple myeloma.
This study allows to gain a better understanding into the
mechanism by which the abnormal microenvironment
affects the pathophysiology and the prognosis of multiple
myeloma. Microenvironment has become a therapeutic target that cannot be ignored in multiple myeloma. However,
the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc targets into this tumoral microenvironment is urgently needed for the development of nextgeneration therapies. Although further work need to be done
to characterize GDF15 biology, we suggest that GDF15
participates in the control of minimal residual disease,
possibly by maintaining in a chemoprotective niche an
undetectable pool of multiple myeloma cells causing the
relapse. Because of the moderately minor phenotype displayed by GDF15-knockout mice (49, 50), therapeutic strategy speciﬁcally targeting GDF15 might be conceivable. In
this regard, future studies from our laboratory will assess
GDF15 as a novel target for therapeutic strategies in multiple myeloma.
