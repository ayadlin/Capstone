Abstract
The toxicity of pharmacologic ascorbate is mediated by the
generation of H2O2 via the oxidation of ascorbate. Because
pancreatic cancer cells are sensitive to H2O2 generated by
ascorbate, they would also be expected to become sensitized
to agents that increase oxidative damage such as ionizing
radiation. The current study demonstrates that pharmacologic
ascorbate enhances the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation as
seen by decreased cell viability and clonogenic survival in all
pancreatic cancer cell lines examined, but not in nontumorigenic pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. Ascorbate radiosensiti-

zation was associated with an increase in oxidative stress–
induced DNA damage, which was reversed by catalase. In mice
with established heterotopic and orthotopic pancreatic tumor
xenografts, pharmacologic ascorbate combined with ionizing
radiation decreased tumor growth and increased survival, without damaging the gastrointestinal tract or increasing systemic
changes in parameters indicative of oxidative stress. Our results
demonstrate the potential clinical utility of pharmacologic
ascorbate as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of pancreatic
cancer. Cancer Res; 75(16); 3314–26. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

predicted to preferentially sensitize tumor cells versus normal
cells via metabolic oxidative stress (1, 5).
IR has long been known to induce DNA damage. In addition to
direct damage, IR generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can
damage proteins, lipids, and DNA, inducing both single- and
double-strand DNA breaks (6). Formation of double-strand
breaks results in the rapid phosphorylation of histone H2AX
(7). Mammalian-phosphorylated H2AX (g-H2AX) is believed to
facilitate the recruitment and retention of DNA repair and checkpoint proteins (8, 9). Radiosensitive tumor cells have been shown
to retain g-H2AX for a longer duration after IR than radioresistant
cells.
Pharmacologic ascorbate-mediated H2O2 formation also
causes DNA damage, which involves transition metal ions such as
Fe2þ associated with DNA (10). Fe2þ reacts with H2O2, producing
site-speciﬁc hydroxyl radical (HO ), damaging DNA bases as well
as the sugar/phosphate backbone of DNA (11). The base excision
repair pathway is the major system for repair of oxidative-induced
DNA damage (12). Thus, DNA damage can be assessed by
measuring g-H2AX, which is upregulated in the presence of
double-strand breaks.
Because both IR and pharmacologic ascorbate initiate DNA
damage, we hypothesize that pharmacologic ascorbate has potential as a radiosensitizer in pancreatic cancer. Here, we demonstrate
that pharmacologic ascorbate is a selective radiosensitizer in
pancreatic cancer versus normal nontumorigenic pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. Pharmacologic ascorbate also enhanced IRinduced DNA damage in pancreatic cancer cells as well as enhancing IR-induced inhibition of tumor growth in established human
pancreatic xenografts without causing systemic changes in parameters indicative of oxidative stress or enhancing normal tissue
injury to the gut epithelium. These results demonstrate the potential utility of pharmacologic ascorbate as an adjuvant to pancreatic
cancer radiotherapy.

Pharmacologic ascorbate induces cytotoxicity and oxidative
stress in pancreatic cancer cells, compared with normal cells
(1). In the extracellular environment, pharmacologic concentrations of ascorbate can oxidize to form hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2; refs. 1–4). H2O2 will diffuse readily across the cell
membrane causing oxidative damage to cellular proteins,
lipids, and DNA. The generation of H2O2 correlates with the
concentration of ascorbate in both a time- and dose-dependent
manners. Ascorbate has been shown to decrease viability in all
pancreatic cancer cell lines studied, but has no effect on nontumorigenic pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (1), and cytotoxicity was reversed with scavengers of H2O2. Furthermore, in vivo
treatment with pharmacologic ascorbate inhibited tumor
growth and prolonged survival. Thus, ascorbate has been
hypothesized to be a "prodrug" for formation of H2O2 in
pancreatic cancer xenografts (1, 3). Therapeutic interventions
designed to increase oxidant stress (such as ionizing radiation,
IR) in combination with pharmacologic ascorbate would be

Ascorbate Radiosensitization

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MIA PaCa-2, AsPC-1, and PANC-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection and passaged for fewer than 6 months after receipt.
MIA PaCa-2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. AsPC-1 cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–
streptomycin. PANC-1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Also, patient-derived pancreatic cancer cell
lines (403 and 339s) from the Medical College of Wisconsin
surgical oncology tissue bank (13, 14) were cultured in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Media Nutrient Mixture F-12 with penicillin/
streptomycin, human recombinant EGF, bovine pituitary extract,
hydrocortisone, and human recombinant insulin. In addition to
the pancreatic cancer cell lines, we also used the nontumorigenic
HPV16-E6E7 immortalized cell line derived from normal pancreatic ductal epithelium (H6c7) with near normal genotype and
phenotype of pancreatic duct epithelial cells (15). H6c7 cells were
maintained in keratinocyte serum-free media supplemented with
epidermal growth factor (5 ng/mL) and bovine pituitary extract
(50 mg/mL). The H6c7 cells were characterized by IDEXX-RADIL.
Proﬁle data were not available for comparison purposes for H6c7
cells. However, the genetic proﬁle for H6c7 cells was compared
with the cell line genetic proﬁles available in the DSMZ STR
database and did not match any other reported proﬁles in the
DSMZ database. The H6c7 cells alone do not form colonies so
feeder cells were used as described (15).
L-ascorbic acid was purchased from Macron Chemicals. Stock
solutions of ascorbate (1.0 mol/L, pH 7.0) were made as previously described (1). For ascorbate treatments, cells were placed in
fresh media and treated with ascorbate for 1 hour at 37 C. To
determine clonogenic survival, cells were treated, trypsinized,
counted, diluted, and plated for clonogenic cell survival assay as
previously described (1). Surviving colonies were ﬁxed and
stained with Coomassie blue after 10 to 14 days and counted
under an inverted light microscope. As another indicator of cell
viability, an assay monitoring the reduction of MTT (3-[4, 5dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was
used. Cells were seeded in 60 mm2 dishes at 3  105 cells per
well and allowed to attach for 24 hours. Next, cells were irradiated
with cesium-137 source, doses ranging from 0 to 10 Gy. Immediately prior and during IR, cells were treated with ascorbate (0.25
mmol/L) in DMEM with 10% FBS for 1 hour. After treatment, the
media were changed, and cells were allowed to recover for 72
hours. The media were removed, and cells were then incubated in
a solution of MTT, 1 mg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), dissolved in serumfree DMEM at 37 C for 3 hours in the dark. At the end of the
incubation time, the media were removed, and DMSO was added
to each plate to dissolve the precipitate. Samples were transferred
to a 96-well plate for plate reader analysis and read at 590 nm on a
Tecan SpectraFluor Plus plate reader (Tecan).
Catalase treatment
To determine whether H2O2 was responsible for the cytotoxic
effects of ascorbate and radiation, cells were treated with various
forms of catalase, including adenovirus catalase (AdCAT), bovine
catalase (100 U/mL), or catalase-polyethylene glycol (PEG-CAT;
200 U/mL). Catalase and PEG-catalase were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. The AdCAT construct used was a replication-

www.aacrjournals.org

defective, E1- and partial E3-deleted recombinant adenovirus
(16). Inserted into the E1 region of the adenovirus genome is
the human catalase gene, which is driven by a cytomegalovirus
promoter. For the adenovirus experiments, approximately 106
cells were plated in 10 mL of complete media in a 100 mm2 tissue
culture dish and allowed to attach for 24 hours. Cells were then
washed three times in serum- and antibiotic-free media. The
adenovirus constructs were applied to cells in 4 mL of serumand antibiotic-free media. Control cells were treated with the
empty adenovirus (AdEmpty) construct. Cells were incubated with
the adenovirus constructs for 24 hours. Media were replaced with
4 mL of complete media for an additional 24 hours before cells
were harvested for Western blot or treated for clonogenic assay.
Cell cycle analysis
Cell viability was measured by ﬂow cytometry using propidium
iodide (PI). After treatment, cells were collected by trypsinization,
centrifuged at 500 g, and resuspended in 500 mL of Hank's
Buffered Salt Solution. After addition of 5 mL of PI (50 mg/mL),
cells were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 5
minutes. PI ﬂuorescence was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (excitation at 488 nm, emission at >550 nm). To analyze alterations in
cell cycle by quantitation of DNA content, cells were collected and
ﬁxed in suspension with 70% ethanol for 4 hours at 4 C. Cells
were washed with 1 mL PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in 100
mL RNase A (1 mg/mL in PBS). After 30-minute incubation at
room temperature, 500 mL PI (35 mg/mL in PBS) was added to
each sample. After 1-hour incubation in the dark at room temperature, PI ﬂuorescence was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.
Determination of intracellular hydrogen peroxide
Intracellular H2O2 concentrations were determined by analysis
of the rate of aminotriazole-mediated inactivation of endogenous
catalase activity (17). Catalase is irreversibly inactivated by aminotriazole (3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; Sigma-Aldrich) in the
presence of H2O2. Cells grown in 150 mm2 culture dishes were
irradiated at 3 Gy and then treated with ascorbate (20 mmol/L) in
the presence of 3-AT (20 mmol/L) for 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 120
minutes at 37 C. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested,
and lysed by freeze/thaw at 80 C followed by room temperature. To determine the amount of fully active cellular catalase, cell
lysates (2 mL) were introduced into the reaction chamber of an
oxygen monitor (YSI model 5300, YSI Inc.). Then 333 mmol/L of
H2O2 was injected into the reaction chamber, and the rate of
production of oxygen was continuously recorded for 5 minutes or
until the curve reached a plateau. The rate of appearance of
dioxygen reﬂects the amount of active catalase in the cell lysate.
Cell protein was determined by Bio-Rad DC protein assay. The
intracellular steady-state concentration of H2O2 was calculated
from the equation [H2O2]ss ¼ kinactivation/k1, where kinactivation is
the experimental pseudo ﬁrst-order rate constant of catalase
inactivation (s1) and k1 ¼ 1.7  107 M1 s1, i.e., the rate
constant for the formation of catalase compound I.
The rate of extracellular production of H2O2 was determined
with a Clark electrode as in refs. 1 and 5.
Intracellular GSH and GSSG measurement
Cells grown in 100 mm2 dishes were treated with IR, ascorbate,
or in combination. After treatments, cells were washed with PBS
and harvested by trypsinization (ﬂoating cells in culture media
and PBS were collected and combined with trypsinized cells).

After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in 100 mL perchloric acid buffer [5% perchloric acid with 100 mmol/L DETAPAC
(diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid); Sigma-Aldrich Chemical
Co.] to precipitate protein. Samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 18,500 g for 5 minutes at 4 C using an Eppendorf
Microcentrifuge. Supernatants were collected and stored at 80 C
or analyzed immediately using HPLC (ESA CoulArray; Dionex/
Thermo Scientiﬁc) with electrochemical detection (ECD) following the protocol described in Park and colleagues (18). In addition,
in separate groups of treated mice, red blood cells (RBC) were
harvested and centrifuged (500 g for 5 minutes). The plasma was
removed from the sample, and the remaining pellet of intact RBCs
was washed twice with cold isotonic saline. An aliquot was
removed for counting by a hemocytometer. From the RBC pellet,
100 mL of RBCs were lysed with 300 mL of perchloric acid buffer
and then centrifuged to pellet the protein (500 g, 5 minutes). The
clean supernatant was stored at 80 C or immediately analyzed
for total glutathione (tGSH) using a plate-reader–based assay (19).

Immunohistochemistry
MIA PaCa-2 cells were seeded in 8-well (0.8 cm2/well) glass
Lab-Tek Chamber slides at a density of 30,000 cells/well. After 48
hours, cells were treated with ascorbate prior to IR treatment. Cells
were ﬁxed in 3% paraformaldehyde and rehydrated in Dulbecco's
PBS (pH 7.4) 30 minutes after treatment and then incubated in
RNAse (0.5 mg/mL) at 37 C for 30 minutes, and 10% normal goat
serum was applied overnight for blocking. Cells were incubated in
anti–g-H2AX primary antibody (1:200; Calbiochem) for 1.5
hours. A goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor
488 (1:500) was used as a secondary antibody to ﬂuorescently
tag g-H2AX. Slides were mounted in Vectashield with DAPI as a
nuclear counterstain. Slides were imaged on a Bio-Rad Radiance
2100 confocal multiphoton microscope with laser sharp software.
Z-plane images of each treatment were captured, and the intensity
of ﬂuorescence was quantiﬁed on ImageJ using a maximum
intensity Z-projection with identical threshold values to calculate
the mean ﬂuorescence intensity for individual cells.

sisted of 9 to 12 mice. MIA PaCa-2 or PANC-1 human pancreatic
tumor cells (2  106) were delivered subcutaneously into the
ﬂank region of nude mice with a 1-mL tuberculin syringe
equipped with a 25-gauge needle. The tumors were allowed to
grow until they reached between 3 mm and 4 mm in greatest
dimension (2 weeks), at which time the mice were randomized
and treatment was initiated. This was deﬁned as day 1 of the
experiment. Before IR, the animals were anesthetized with 80 to
100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine i.p. and shielded in a
lead block such that only the tumor-bearing right hind ﬂank was
irradiated. Tumor size was measured twice a week using a digital
caliper, and tumor volume was estimated according to the following formula: tumor volume ¼ p/6  L  W2, where L is the
greatest dimension of the tumor, and W is the dimension of the
tumor in the perpendicular direction (20). Animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation when the tumors reached a predetermined size of 1,000 mm3. In the orthotopic pancreatic cancer
model, 6-week-old athymic nude mice were injected with the
human pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2, which had previously been stably transfected with ﬁreﬂy luciferase. Ultrasound
guidance was used to identify the pancreas as described (21), and
400,000 cells suspended in 20 mL of a 1:1 mixture of PBS and
Matrigel were injected into the pancreas under direct visualization. Bioluminescence-imaging microscopy was used to identify
mice with established tumors within the pancreas, and tumorcontaining mice were randomly assigned and treatment was
initiated. Tumor growth was monitored using bioluminescence-imaging microscopy to determine the average radiance
(photons/s/cm2) of the tumors.
In separate groups of treated animals, mouse tumors were
excised and processed as described to determine 4-hydroxy-2nonenal-(4HNE)–modiﬁed proteins (22). Brieﬂy, tissues were
homogenized and 25 mg of protein was blotted onto PVDF
membranes. Blots were incubated with the primary antibody
recognizing the Michael addition product of 4HNE-modiﬁed
cellular proteins (23) diluted 1:2,000 overnight at 4  C, followed
by 2 hours in secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit polyclonal antibody (1:20,000), and chemiluminescence
detection with X-ray ﬁlm. Immunoreactive protein on the dot blot
was analyzed using integrated densities determined with ImageJ
software.
In separate groups of mice, a crypt cell assay was performed.
Mice were exposed to 10 Gy or 13 Gy of total abdominal radiation
with and without ascorbate (4 g/kg/d). After 48 hours, each animal
was sacriﬁced and sections were made of the jejunum and then
viewed under light microscopy and expressed as surviving cells/
circumference. In addition, blood samples for TNFa were collected
into 4.0 mL heparinized vial from control mice and mice treated
with radiation (13 Gy) and/or ascorbate (4g/kg). Samples were
centrifuged at 200 g for 20 minutes. Serum samples were collected
from each tube and stored at 80 C. TNFa levels in the serum
were measured using a Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems).

Animal experiments
Thirty-day-old athymic nude mice were obtained from Harlan
Sprague-Dawley. The nude mice protocol was reviewed and
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Iowa. The animals were housed in a cage and were fed a
sterile commercial stock diet and tap water, ad libitum. Animals
were allowed to acclimate in the unit for 1 week before any
manipulations were performed. Each experimental group con-

Statistical analysis
A single factor ANOVA followed by the Tukey post hoc test was
used to determine statistical differences between mean for multiple comparisons, or a Student t test was used when only two
comparisons. All mean were calculated from three experiments,
with error bars representing the SEM. All Western blots were
repeated at least twice. All data are expressed as mean  SEM.
A dose-modifying factor (DMF) was calculated for each cell line

Immunoblot analysis
Protein (10–40 mg) was electrophoresed in a 4% to 20% BioRad ready gel and then electrotransferred to an Immobilon PVDF
membrane (EMD Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5%
nonfat milk for 1 hour, then treated with anti–g-H2AX (Ser 139)
antibody (1:1,000; EMD Millipore), or with anti-catalase antibody (1:5,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology). Horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat antimouse (1:50,000; Chemicon International) was used as a secondary antibody. Anti-GAPDH (1:1,000; EMD Millipore) or antiactin (1:4,000; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a loading control.
Blots were treated with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and exposed to autoradiography ﬁlm.

based on clonogenic surviving fraction. For the in vivo studies, the
statistical analyses focused on the effects of different treatments
on tumor progression. The primary outcomes of interest were
time to death and tumor growth over time. The log-rank test was
used to compare the survival times between treatment groups.
Kaplan–Meier survival plots were constructed to estimate survival.
Linear mixed effects regression models were used to estimate and
compare group-speciﬁc tumor growth curves. Tests of statistical
signiﬁcance were two-sided and performed using the Systat and
SAS software.

Results
Ascorbate enhances IR-induced cytotoxicity
Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that
pharmacologic ascorbate is cytotoxic to pancreatic cancer cells
while normal cells are resistant (1). To test the effect of ascorbate
on radiation response in cancer versus noncancerous cell lines, we
performed clonogenic (Fig. 1A–D) and cell viability assays (Fig.

1E and F) using three pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas [MIA
PaCa-2, PANC-1 (Fig. 1A and B), and AsPC-1 (Fig. 1C)], compared with normal nontumorigenic H6c7 pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (Fig. 1D). The radiation survival curves were normalized to ascorbate- or sham-treated controls and ﬁt with a linear
quadratic model. Pharmacologic ascorbate (0.25 mmol/L)
enhanced IR-induced decreases in clonogenic survival. The pancreatic cancer cell lines showed dose modiﬁcation factors at 10%
iso-survival of 2.5 (MIA PaCa-2), 2.2 (PANC-1; Fig. 1A and B), and
1.25 (AsPC-1; Fig. 1C). In contrast, no radiosensitization was
noted with ascorbate in the normal nontumorigenic H6c7 pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (Fig. 1D). Similar results were seen
using cell viability where there was radiosensitization in the MIA
PaCa-2 cell line (Fig. 1E) but no radiosensitization in the H6c7 cell
line (Fig. 1F). To determine if ascorbate radiosensitization occurs
in the physiologically relevant environment seen in pancreatic
cancer, we treated patient-derived pancreatic cancer cell lines, 339
(Fig. 1G) and 403 (Fig. 1H; refs. 13, 14) in 4% O2. Again, we
demonstrated ascorbate radiosensitization in the 339 line with a

Ascorbate radiosensitization induces DNA damage. A, in MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells, both IR (2 Gy) and ascorbate (2 mmol/L) induced the formation of
g-H2AX as determined by Western blot, whereas the combination treatment further enhanced g-H2AX formation. B, in AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, ascorbate
(2 mmol/L) radiosensitization increased g-H2AX immunoreactive protein, which was reversed with catalase pretreatment. C, g-H2AX immunohistochemistry
demonstrated increased g-H2AX formation with the combination treatment, which was reversed with catalase pretreatment. Cells were treated with ascorbate

DMF of 1.4 at 40% iso-survival and a DMF of 1.6 in the 403 cell
line at 40% iso-survival. The timing for the administration of
pharmacologic ascorbate is also important. Treating cells with
ascorbate for 1 hour prior to IR or 1 hour immediately after IR
demonstrated a similar decrease in clonogenic survival when
compared with IR or ascorbate alone. However, when ascorbate
was administered 6 hours after IR, the decrease in clonogenic
survival was decreased (Supplementary Fig. S1). These data
strongly support the hypothesis that pharmacologic ascorbate is
a selective radiosensitizer in pancreatic cancer cells versus normal
nontumorigenic pancreatic ductal epithelial cells.
Cell cycle analysis of ascorbate-induced radiosensitization
Hydrogen peroxide generation has been reported to induce cell
cycle arrest at G1 and G2 (24). IR-induced DNA damage also
triggers G1 or G2 arrest, allowing time for cells to repair DNA
damage (25). In MIA PaCa-2 cells treated with ascorbate
(2 mmol/L) or 2 Gy alone or combination for 6, 24, 48, and
72 hours, there was no signiﬁcant change in cell cycle distribution.
However, the sub-G1 population increased in cells treated with

www.aacrjournals.org

ascorbate (2 mmol/L) or combination of 2 Gy IR and ascorbate
(2 mmol/L) at 6 and 24 hours. At 24 hours, there was a signiﬁcant
sub-G1 fraction in the combination group compared with the
control, IR alone, and ascorbate alone groups (Supplementary
Fig. S2). In addition, the PI viability assay at 24 hours after
treatment demonstrated that there was no signiﬁcant change in
viability with IR (2 Gy) alone while pharmacologic ascorbate
alone induced an 89%  1% sub-G1 fraction that was increased
to 96%  2% with the combination treatment. These data,
taken together with the clonogenic survival and cell viability
assays, strongly support the hypothesis that pharmacologic ascorbate is a radiosensitizer in pancreatic cancer cells.
Ascorbate radiosensitization is mediated by H2O2
Ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity is mediated by the formation of
H2O2 during the oxidation of ascorbate. Similarly, IR generates
numerous ROS, including H2O2 and hydroxyl radical from the
radiolysis of water. We hypothesized that ascorbate-induced
radiosensitization is mediated by H2O2. To determine if intracellular levels of H2O2 change upon exposure to pharmacologic

Ascorbate Radiosensitization

ascorbate, intracellular concentrations of H2O2 were determined
by the rate of aminotriazole-mediated inactivation of endogenous
catalase activity. Cells were treated with IR (3 Gy), ascorbate (20
mmol/L), or in combination, and catalase activity was assayed in
cells treated with 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). Using the stoichiometric inactivation of catalase in the presence of H2O2 and excess 3AT, baseline intracellular concentration of H2O2 6 hours after
treatment was 53  6 pmol/L in pancreas cancer cells; this
increased to 71  9 pmol/L with exposure to pharmacologic
ascorbate, and 79  14 pmol/L following IR. However, the
combination of IR þ ascorbate increased the concentration of
intracellular H2O2 to 105  2 pmol/L (Fig. 2A).
Under steady-state conditions, intracellular GSH is maintained at millimolar concentrations, which keeps cells in a
reduced environment and serves as the principal intracellular
redox buffer when cells are subjected to an oxidative stressor
including H2O2 (26). Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity
catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 to water with the conversion of
GSH to glutathione disulﬁde (GSSG). Under steady-state conditions, GSSG is recycled back to GSH by glutathione disulﬁde
reductase using reducing equivalents from NADPH. However,
under conditions of increased H2O2 ﬂux, this recycling mechanism may become overwhelmed, leading to a depletion of
intracellular GSH (27, 28).
Because ascorbate combined with radiation signiﬁcantly
increases the intracellular H2O2, we next examined the effects
of the combination of ascorbate and IR on the GSH/GSSG
intracellular redox couple. MIA PaCa-2 cells were treated with
IR (2 Gy) and ascorbate (2 mmol/L) and harvested at various
time points (1–24 hours). Cells treated with IR þ ascorbate
showed a signiﬁcant decrease in intracellular GSH concentration
at 6 hours compared with untreated cells (2.5  0.1 mmol/L vs.
2.1  0.1 mmol/L, respectively, mean  S.D., n ¼ 3, P < 0.05)
and failed to recover after 24 hours (Fig. 2B). The half-cell
reduction potential (Ehc) of the GSSG/2GSH couple, which is
a marker for overall redox environment of the cell (26), was
calculated using the Nernst equation. Ehc increased (more positive), indicating a more oxidized intracellular redox environment. This increase mirrored the depletion of GSH (Fig. 2B). MIA
PaCa-2 cells have a baseline oxygen consumption rate of 57 amol
cell1 s1 (29); assuming 1% efﬁciency, this corresponds to a
metabolic rate for the production of H2O2 of less than 1 amol
cell1 s1. The ﬂux of H2O2 in these experiments was 1,400 amol
cell1 s1, considerably greater than the metabolic ﬂux, thus
recycling of GSSG to GSH is rate-limiting and depletion of GSH
and an increase (more positive) in Ehc would be expected (28).
Changes in Ehc have been shown to correlate with biologic
status of the cell with a change from 240 mV to 170 mV as
cells shift from the state of proliferation to the onset of cell death
(26). These results indicate that ascorbate radiosensitization can
create an overwhelming oxidative stress to pancreatic cancer cells,
resulting in oxidation/depletion of the GSH intracellular redox
buffer, resulting in cell death.

To further determine whether H2O2 was responsible for the
cytotoxic effects of ascorbate þ radiation, cells were pretreated
with either AdEmpty (50 MOI) or AdCAT (50 MOI) adenoviral
vectors. Figure 2C demonstrates that there was robust expression
of immunoreactive intracellular catalase in MIA PaCa-2 cells
treated with the AdCAT vector when compared with control- or
AdEmpty-treated cells. IR decreased clonogenic survival to 50% of
AdEmpty alone values, whereas ascorbate (2 mmol/L) decreased
clonogenic survival to 26%  2% (Fig. 2D). The combination of
2 Gy IR and ascorbate (2 mmol/L) further decreased clonogenic
survival to 6%  1%. This decrease in clonogenic survival was
signiﬁcantly reversed, with overexpression of intracellular catalase
resulting in clonogenic survival of 41%  1%, which was not
signiﬁcantly different from IR, suggesting that H2O2 mediates
ascorbate radiosensitization (Fig. 2D).
Ascorbate radiosensitization induces DNA damage
g-H2AX is a sensor of DNA strand breaks (30) and promotes
efﬁcient double-strand break repair (31). As shown in Fig. 3A, 2
Gy IR and ascorbate (2 mmol/L) induced formation of g-H2AX in
MIA PaCa-2 cells. However, the combination of IR and ascorbate
increased formation of g-H2AX, indicating a greater number of
double-strand breaks. Previous studies have demonstrated that
ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity is mediated by generation of H2O2
(1–3). To determine if H2O2 mediates the increase in g-H2AX
during ascorbate-induced radiosensitization, cells were treated
with extracellular catalase. Figure 3B demonstrates that the combination treatment of IR and ascorbate induced increased formation of g-H2AX in AsPC-1 cells compared with either treatment
alone. The increase in g-H2AX with the combination treatment
was inhibited with catalase pretreatment, suggesting that H2O2
mediates the increase in g-H2AX during ascorbate-induced radiosensitization. In addition to Western blot, we demonstrated
similar increases in double-strand DNA breaks as seen by g-H2AX
on immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3C). In cells treated with ascorbate (1 mmol/L), IR alone, or the combination of the two
treatments, the increase in ﬂuorescence was reversed with catalase
pretreatment. Once again, quantiﬁcation of these images demonstrated signiﬁcant increases in ﬂuorescence after ascorbate
treatment and after IR þ ascorbate combination treatment that
was ameliorated with catalase pretreatment (Fig. 3D). These
experiments were repeated with varying doses of pharmacologic
ascorbate and varying doses of IR with similar results (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, H2O2 signiﬁcantly contributes to the DNA
damage observed upon exposure to pharmacologic ascorbate and
IR, as seen by g-H2AX.
Ascorbate-induced radiosensitization in vivo
We have previously demonstrated that ascorbate alone inhibits tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model with intraperitoneal administration of 4 g/kg twice daily (1). Pre-established
MIA PaCa-2 tumors in nude mice were treated with either:
saline (1 mol/L NaCl i.p. daily); IR (7.5 Gy on days 5 and 8 and

(Continued.) Both IR and ascorbate alone decreased intracellular GSH compared with controls. The combination of ascorbate and IR did not further decrease GSH
when compared with IR alone. D, complete blood counts and differential in control mice and those treated with ascorbate, IR, and IR þ ascorbate. White
blood cell counts were decreased with IR, which was unchanged when ascorbate was added to the treatment regimen. E, initially, puriﬁed BSA was reacted with
excess puriﬁed 4-HNE to create a positively labeled protein control, which is seen in the top plot. The negative control was puriﬁed BSA without puriﬁed 4-HNE.
Then, to determine 4-HNE–modiﬁed proteins in separate groups of mice, dot blots for 4-HNE–modiﬁed proteins in cardiac muscle showed no changes in
immunoreactive protein after any of the treatments compared with controls. F, dot blots for 4-HNE–modiﬁed proteins in heart, kidney, and liver demonstrated no
changes in immunoreactive protein after any of the treatments compared with controls.

daily); ascorbate (4 g/kg i.p. daily); or ascorbate þ IR (mean, n ¼ 7–12 animals/group).  , P < 0.05, control versus ascorbate þ IR; #, P < 0.05, ascorbate þ IR

summaries of tumor volumes used in the mixed linear regression analysis of growth curves. The sample sizes (N) given in
the table are the total number of measurements available
within each group. Pairwise comparisons were carried out to
assess group differences. Treatment with the combination of
ascorbate þ IR signiﬁcantly delayed tumor growth compared
with controls or ascorbate alone (Fig. 4A). Summary statistics
for the survival analysis are presented in Supplementary Table
S2. The estimated survival curve for the treatment groups is
given by the Kaplan–Meier plots in Fig. 4B. Ascorbate þ IR also
signiﬁcantly increased overall survival compared with controls,
IR alone, or ascorbate alone (Fig. 4B). Most notably, 54% of
mice treated with the combination of IR þ ascorbate had no
measurable tumors (Supplementary Table S2). Treatment was
well tolerated as evidenced by similar weight gain patterns in all
groups of mice (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Oxidative stress indicators
Glutathione is a measurable marker indicative of the oxidation
state of the thiol redox buffer in cells. In severe systemic oxidative
stress, the GSSG/2GSH couple may become oxidized, i.e., the
concentration of GSH decreases and GSSG may increase because
the capacity to recycle GSSG to GSH becomes rate-limiting. As
seen in Fig. 4C, intracellular concentrations of GSH in red blood
cells of mice after ascorbate, IR, and ascorbate þ IR treatments
decreased. However, the addition of pharmacologic ascorbate
with IR did not signiﬁcantly reduce GSH levels compared with
5 Gy IR alone. This suggests that the very high levels of pharmacologic ascorbate in these experiments may have a pro-oxidant
toward red blood cells as seen by a decrease in the capacity of the
intracellular redox buffer. To further determine the effect of these
treatments on hematological parameters, complete blood counts
were determined in separate groups of mice. Although ascorbate
and IR decreased intracellular GSH in red blood cells, there were
no signiﬁcant changes in hemoglobin and/or hematocrits

3322 Cancer Res; 75(16) August 15, 2015

between groups of mice. As seen in Fig. 4D, mice that received
IR alone or IR þ ascorbate had a signiﬁcant decrease in white
blood cells, suggesting some immunosuppression with IR. However, ascorbate did not add to further decreases in white blood
cells, and the percentage of neutrophils and lymphocyte counts
were unchanged between groups.
Oxidation of lipids generates highly reactive aldehydes, such
as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which can be used as a marker
of oxidative damage (32, 33). To further examine systemic
oxidative stress, we harvested heart, kidney, and liver from
mice treated with the various combinations to determine 4HNE–modiﬁed proteins. As seen in Fig. 4E, there were no
differences in 4-HNE–modiﬁed proteins in heart tissue in mice
treated with the various combinations. In addition, dot blot
analysis of the other organs demonstrated no differences in 4HNE proteins after the various treatments (Fig. 4F). These data
support the hypothesis that ascorbate radiosensitization does
not cause an increase in oxidative damage from lipid-derived
aldehydes to other organs.
Orthotopic tumors were established using ultrasound guidance
as described (Fig. 5A; ref. 21). After bioluminescence-imaging
microscopy identiﬁed mice with established tumors within the
pancreas (Fig. 5B), mice were randomly assigned to one of four
treatment groups: controls received NaCl (1 mol/L) i.p. daily;
ascorbate 4 g/kg i.p. daily; NaCl i.p. daily and two separate
fractions of 5 Gy IR one week apart on days 4 and 11; a group
that received both IR and ascorbate. Tumor sizes were measured
weekly throughout the experiments, resulting in repeated measurements for each mouse. Linear mixed effects regression models
were used to estimate and compare group-speciﬁc tumor growth
curves. Supplementary Table S3 provides statistical summaries of
tumor volumes used in the linear mixed effects regression analysis
of growth curves. The sample sizes (N) given in the table are the
total number of measurements available within each group.
Pairwise comparisons were carried out to assess group differences.
P values for the comparisons are listed in Supplementary Table S3.

Radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity is highly relevant to
the treatment of pancreatic cancer with radiation. To determine if
pharmacologic ascorbate changes the response of the gastrointestinal tract following radiation in a clinically meaningful way, a
crypt cell assay was performed (Fig. 6). Control animals and those

treated with pharmacologic ascorbate (4 g/kg) had similar degrees
of crypt cell generation. IR alone (10 Gy) decreased crypts to 28%
of control values, while 13 Gy decreased crypts to 44% of control
values. Addition of pharmacologic ascorbate partially reversed the
decreases in both the 10 Gy and 13 Gy groups of mice, suggesting
that ascorbate may protect the gastrointestinal tract from the
damaging effects of IR. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that radiation-induced jejunal toxicity was accompanied by increases in serum TNFa (34). TNFa was 7.5  2.2 pg/mL
in controls and was increased to 25.0  1.5 pg/mL after 13 Gy.

suggest that pharmacologic ascorbate may protect the gut locally
by decreasing IR-induced damage to the crypt cells, and systemically, by ameliorating increases in TNFa.
The in vivo animal experiments were repeated using PANC-1
tumors. In these sets of experiments, we added gemcitabine to the
IR group as done in clinical practice (35). The mice were divided
into four groups and treated with either: saline (1 mol/L NaCl i.p.
daily); IR/gemcitabine (5 Gy on days 4 and 8 with gemcitabine 60
mg/kg i.p. every fourth day for 2 weeks and 1 mol/L NaCl i.p.
daily); ascorbate (4 g/kg i.p. daily); or ascorbate þ IR/gemcitabine. As seen in Fig. 7A, treatment with IR/gemcitabine delayed
tumor growth compared with ascorbate alone (P < 0.05). However, the combination of ascorbate þ IR/gemcitabine further
delayed tumor growth compared with ascorbate alone (P <
0.001). Summary statistics for the survival analysis are presented
in Supplementary Table S4. The estimated survival curve for the
treatment groups is given by the Kaplan–Meier plots in Fig. 7B.
Ascorbate þ IR/gemcitabine also signiﬁcantly increased overall
survival compared with ascorbate alone (Fig. 7B). Most notably,
100% of the mice on day 43 that were treated with the combination of ascorbate þ IR/gemcitabine were surviving (Fig. 7B).
Treatment was well tolerated as evident by similar weight gain
patterns in all groups of mice (Fig. 7C).

Discussion
Our current study demonstrates the potential for pharmacologic ascorbate as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of pancreatic
cancer. IR is the standard of care in pancreatic cancer in a variety of

3324 Cancer Res; 75(16) August 15, 2015

clinical scenarios, including (i) locally advanced pancreatic cancer; (ii) positive margins or positive lymph nodes after pancreatic
resection; or (iii) large tumors that obstruct the duodenum
(36). Chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy has also
shown to improve survival in pancreatic cancer when compared
with single-modality therapy (37). In addition, radiotherapy
can also provide palliation to patients with locally advanced
disease (38). Thus, pharmacologic ascorbate-induced radiosensitization may have clinical beneﬁts.
In our present study, we have shown that pharmacologic
ascorbate signiﬁcantly decreases clonogenic survival and inhibits
the growth of all pancreatic cancer cell lines as a single agent, as
well as sensitizes cancer cells to IR. This corresponds well with
other reports demonstrating that pharmacologic ascorbate
enhances IR-induced cell killing and DNA fragmentation, leading
to induction of apoptosis in HL60 leukemia cells (39). In addition, Hurst and colleagues demonstrated that pharmacologic
ascorbate combined with IR leads to increased numbers of double-strand DNA breaks and cell cycle arrest when compared with
either treatment alone (40). Our previous studies demonstrated
that pharmacologic ascorbate could serve as a "prodrug" for the
delivery of H2O2 to tumors (1–4). There was both a time- and
dose-dependent increase in measured H2O2 production with
increased concentrations of ascorbate. Others have demonstrated
increased levels of double-strand breaks with pharmacologic
ascorbate and H2O2 treatment to tumor cells (41, 42). In addition,
the double-strand breaks induced by H2O2 were more slowly
repaired.
Previously, we demonstrated that the immortalized, nontumorigenic pancreatic ductal epithelial cells H6c7 are resistant to

Ascorbate Radiosensitization

ascorbate-induced toxicity (1). Consistent with this study, our
current study demonstrates that H6c7 cells are also resistant to the
combination treatment of IR and ascorbate. The selective ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity may be due to the combination of low
levels of antioxidant enzymes and high endogenous levels of ROS
in cancer cells (43–45). Moreover, tumor cells are often defective
in DNA repair, whereas normal cells are proﬁcient (46). The
combination of ascorbate and IR provides two distinct mechanisms of action: ascorbate-induced toxicity due to extracellular
production of H2O2 that then diffuses into cells and causes
damage to DNA, protein, and lipids; and radiation-induced
toxicity as a result of ROS-induced damage to DNA. In addition,
redox metals like Fe2þ may play an important role in ascorbateinduced cytotoxicity. By catalyzing the oxidation of ascorbate,
labile iron can enhance the rate of formation of H2O2; labile iron
can also react with H2O2. Recently, our group has demonstrated
that pharmacologic ascorbate and IR increase the labile iron in
tumor homogenates from this murine model of pancreatic cancer
(47). In our present study using a pancreatic cancer xenograft
model, we demonstrated that ascorbate or IR alone decreased
tumor growth, but the combination treatment further inhibited
tumor growth, indicating that pharmacologic ascorbate is an
effective radiosensitizer in vivo. In addition, all groups of mice
had similar weight gain during treatment, suggesting lack of
normal tissue toxicity with the combination treatment.
That approximately 30% of pancreatic patients receive a
diagnosis of advanced locoregional disease underscores the
importance of radiotherapy for local disease control (48). Our
preclinical model shows that the combination of IR and ascorbate enhances toxicity in pancreatic cancer cells compared with
either treatment alone. In a phase I clinical trial that investigated the use of pharmacologic ascorbate as an adjuvant to
gemcitabine, the standard of care, in the treatment of pancreatic
cancer, it was well-tolerated with few dose-limiting toxicities
(49). The data reported here support testing of pharmacologic
ascorbate as an adjuvant treatment for radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer patients after surgical resection or with locally
advanced disease. Indeed, the preclinical translational studies
in this current study have led us to develop and implement a
phase I clinical trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01852890,
Cullen PI) with FDA approval (IND 105715, Cullen sponsor-investigator).
