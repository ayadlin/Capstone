ABSTRACT
Chromatin undergoes structural changes in response to extracellular and
environmental signals. We observed changes in nuclear morphology in cancer tissue
biopsied after chemotherapy and hypothesised that these DNA damage-induced
changes are mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Nuclear morphological
changes in cell lines (PE01 and PE04 models) and a xenograft model (OV1002)
were measured in response to platinum chemotherapy by image analysis of nuclear
texture. HDAC2 expression increased in PEO1 cells treated with cisplatin at 24h,
which was accompanied by increased expression of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1).
HDAC2 and HP1 expression were also increased after carboplatin treatment in the
OV1002 carboplatin-sensitive xenograft model but not in the insensitive HOX424
model. Expression of DNA damage response pathways (pBRCA1, γH2AX, pATM, pATR)
showed time-dependent changes after cisplatin treatment. HDAC2 knockdown by
siRNA reduced HP1 expression, induced DNA double strand breaks (DSB) measured
by γH2AX, and interfered with the activation of DNA damage response induced by
cisplatin. Furthermore, HDAC2 depletion affected γH2AX foci formation, cell cycle
distribution, and apoptosis triggered by cisplatin, and was additive to the inhibitory
effect of cisplatin in cell lines. By inhibiting expression of HDAC2, reversible alterations
in chromatin patterns during cisplatin treatment were observed. These results
demonstrate quantifiable alterations in nuclear morphology after chemotherapy,
and implicate HDAC2 in higher order chromatin changes and cellular DNA damage
responses in ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

Mammalian HDACs are grouped into four classes
based on structural homology, enzymatic activity, and
cellular localisation [9, 10, 11, 12]. Class I HDACs
(HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 8) are mainly nuclear, and they
interact with histones and other proteins [13, 14], while
class II HDACs (HDAC 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10) are tissuespecific and can be both nuclear and cytoplasmic [13];
the majority of HDAC inhibitors inhibit both class I and
class II enzymes [15, 13]. Class III HDACs, namely
sirtuins (SIRTs1 – 7; silent information regulators), are
unresponsive to most HDAC inhibitors but require the
cofactor NAD+. Finally, the class IV HDAC, HDAC11, is
expressed in the nucleus and shares homology with class I
and class II HDACs [15, 16].

INTRODUCTION
Chromatin structure is dynamic, and changes occur
in response to extracellular and environmental signals
[1]. Histone tail acetylation is an important chromatin
modification that alters DNA accessibility to regulating
enzymes by transforming chromatin from a compact to
relaxed structure that is permissive of gene expression [2,
3]. The balance between histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities ultimately
determines acetylation status [4]. Histone acetylation is
involved with cellular differentiation, mitosis and meiosis,
DNA transcriptional regulation, DNA damage, DNA
replication, and circadian rhythms [5, 6, 7, 8].

RESULTS

HAT and HDAC activity can be altered by
mutation, overexpression, or translocation, disrupting
the acetylation-deacetylation balance and consequently
contributing to cancer hallmarks; these epigenetic changes
have been observed in leukaemia and prostate, breast,
colorectal, and ovarian cancers [17, 13]. Acetylation
changes are thought to participate in carcinogenesis
by silencing tumor suppressor gene promoters, such as
p21, [18, 19], activation of repressed genes, or abnormal
recruitment of HATs or HDACs [13].
The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) protein
family plays various roles in establishing and maintaining
heterochromatin (tightly-packed DNA) structure, thereby
repressing transcription [20]. HP1 overexpression can
cause global gene repression and chromatin condensation
[21, 22]. The three human HP1 isoforms, HP1α, HP1β,
and HP1γ, share functions and localise to chromatin with
incomplete overlap [23], differentially localising to centric
heterochromatin, telomeres, and specific euchromatic
sites [24]. Alterations in HP protein expression have been
identified in some cancers including ovarian [25], breast
[26], and colorectal cancer [27].
We have observed changes in nuclear structure
in clinical samples of cancer tissue after treatment with
chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since structure dictates
gene expression and, therefore, function, we sought
to investigate this phenomenon to better understand
therapeutic responses. We hypothesised that nuclear
morphological changes in cancer in response to DNA
damage are mediated by HDACs and are associated
with changes in HP1 protein expression and/or nuclear
distribution. Initial studies indicated changes in expression
of HDAC2, therefore, we explored whether HDAC2
mediated response to injury and might act as a resistance
factor to DNA-damaging therapy.

Nuclear structure changes after chemotherapy
or radiotherapy in ovarian cancer cells
Preliminary observations by light microscopy
suggested that nuclear morphology was different in
clinical tumors after treatment with chemotherapy and
radiotherapy (Figure 1). To explore this phenomenon
further, chromatin patterns were quantified by nuclear
texture image analysis in an ovarian cancer cell line
model. Texture features were regarded as positively
or negatively associated with chromatin patterns
(homogeneity, heterogeneity, and contrast) as previously
described [28, 29]. Five parameters associated with
texture were obtained: angular second moment (ASM),
correlation, entropy, inverse different moment (IDM)
and contrast. ASM is a strong measure of uniformity
or smoothness associated with overall homogeneity of
chromatin patterns. Correlation calculates the grey-level
linear dependency of the image and correlates negatively
with the heterogeneity of chromatin patterns. Entropy
measures pattern disorder and is negatively correlated with
homogeneity. Inverse different moment (IDM) measures
the local variability and intensity of a region of interest
(ROI) and is affected by image homogeneity, with nonhomogeneous areas normally resulting in low IDM values;
thus, it is described as the ‘contrast’ of chromatin patterns.
PE01 ovarian cancer cells [30] grown on coverslips
were treated with cisplatin or ionising radiation and
incubated for 0h, 6h, 12h and 24h. After 24 h treatment
with 6 μM cisplatin or 6 Gy radiation, all five image
texture parameters measured changed compared to
untreated controls; observations were similar for both
cisplatin and radiation. ASM, correlation, and IDM

decreased after cisplatin/radiation treatment by 20%/23%,
25%/49%, and 15%/11%, respectively, while entropy
and contrast increased by 6%/8% and 40%/120%. The
heterogeneity and contrast of chromatin increased and the
homogeneity decreased in cell nuclei after DNA damageinducing treatment with cisplatin and radiation, consistent
with the observations made by light microscopy.

patient-derived ovarian cancer xenograft model [31].
Carboplatin, a cisplatin analogue, was used as this drug
is commonly used clinically. After a single treatment with
carboplatin, ovarian cancer xenografts were collected
on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. Haematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining and light microscopy indicated similar
morphological changes to those seen in vitro (Figure
1). Untreated tumors tended to have strongly stained
and homogeneous nuclei, while nuclei after carboplatin
treatment had more lightly stained nuclei and greater
heterogeneity (Figure 2B). When nuclear texture was
analysed by image analysis, texture parameters were
different in samples after carboplatin treatment compared

Measurement of nuclear texture changes in
response to carboplatin in vivo
We next sought to establish whether similar nuclear
changes occur in vivo using a platinum-sensitive OV1002

At least 100 nuclei were included in each experiment. Nuclear texture was analysed by measuring five texture parameters (angular second

to controls, with the most significant effects of singledose carboplatin typically seen two days after treatment
(entropy and IDM p=0.034 and 0.008, respectively; Figure
2C), indicating that chromatin pattern changes occur after
platinum treatment in vivo and in vitro (Figure 2D).

IIA (HDAC4) members in PEO1 and PEO4 cells 24h after
cisplatin treatment. The PE04 cell line was derived from
the same patient as the PE01 cell line but after resistance
had developed [30]. Since changes in nuclear texture after
cisplatin treatment were most pronounced at 24 h, we
speculated that HDACs would similarly show maximal
changes at this time point. HDAC2 expression was
increased approximately 1.5 fold in cisplatin-treated PEO1
cells, but not in PE04 cells, compared to controls at 24 h.
Expression of HDACs 1, 3, 4 and 8 were unchanged in both
cell lines after 24h (data not shown). This suggests that
HDAC2 might be a cisplatin response biomarker in vitro,
at least in sensitive cells. HP1 heterochromatin isoforms
were also measured after cisplatin treatment (Figure 3A).
Two HP1 isoforms (HP1α and HP1β) increased by about

It has previously been shown that HDAC1, HDAC3,
and HDAC4 might be associated with resistance to
chemotherapy and poor prognosis in cancer patients
[32 - 34]. To investigate whether HDACs are involved
in DNA damage-based treatment, we measured protein
expression of HDAC class I (HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8) and

30% and 70%, respectively, but only in PEO1 cells after 24
h cisplatin treatment, while HP1γ protein remained static.
To visualise and confirm these observations,
immunofluorescence (IF) was performed on PEO1 and
PEO4 cells with or without cisplatin treatment using
antibodies targeting HDAC2, HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ
(Figure 3B). As expected, expression of HDAC2 increased
24 h after cisplatin treatment, and HP1 proteins gradually
increased over 24 h of cisplatin treatment in PEO1 cells
(Figure 3B). Again no changes were observed in PEO4
cells (data not shown). The IF images confirmed nuclear
localisation of these targets.
Since HDAC2 and HP1 protein expression changed
after cisplatin treatment in PEO1 cells, we next measured
mRNA expression. Transcription of HDAC2, HP1α, HP1β,
and HP1γ were all significantly elevated by cisplatin
treatment (p<0.05) after 24 h in PEO1 cells (Figure 3C),
mirroring the protein expression changes; however, mRNA
levels remained unchanged in PEO4 cells (data not shown).
The changes in HP1 expression suggest that the amount of
heterochromatin increases after DNA-damaging treatment.

HP1 proteins were significantly increased in the sensitive
model (OV1002) after carboplatin treatment, with the most
significant changes (p<0.05) observed on day 7 (Figure 4).
In the HOX424 model, expression of these proteins was
similar between control and treated groups.

Time-dependent cellular DNA damage response
induced by cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells
We next investigated several DNA damage response
(DDR) pathway members (γH2AX, pBRCA1, ATM,
pATM, ATR, and pATR) by western blotting (Figure 5). As
expected, the DNA damage response proteins pBRCA1,
γH2AX, pATM, and pATR participated in the response to
cisplatin and were upregulated after treatment. pBRCA1
expression increased after 24 h of cisplatin treatment
in PEO1 cells, which persisted to 96 h, while γH2AX,
pATM, and pATR increases occurred slightly later from
48 h. ATM and ATR protein expression remained stable
except for ATM reductions at 96 h.

pronounced changes in response to cisplatin, we examined

Characterisation of cellular responses to
cisplatin treatment in ovarian cancer cells when
HDAC2 is suppressed

the effect of HDAC2 knockdown by siRNA (Figure
6A). HDAC2 knockdown was efficient (Supplementary
Figure 1). Expression of HDAC3, HDAC4, and
HDAC8 were not significantly affected by HDAC2
knockdown. Interestingly, HDAC1 expression was mildly
upregulated after HDAC2 knockdown, indicating a
possible compensatory effect as previously reported [35
- 37]. Since HDAC2 was implicated in heterochromatin
formation, we further assessed HP isoform expression
after HDAC2 knockdown (Figure 6A). There were
minor changes in HP1 protein expression, with mild
downregulation (20%) of HP1α on HDAC2 knockdown.
With respect to DNA damage response protein expression,
HDAC2 knockdown resulted in marked upregulation of
γH2AX and downregulation of pBRCA1 (Figure 6A).
In contrast, other DDR proteins (pATM, ATM, pATR,
ATR, and Rad51; Figure 6A) were not obviously affected.
This suggests that double-strand breaks accumulate and
DNA repair might be suppressed on HDAC2 knockdown,
although the upregulation of γH2AX might also indicate
that the cells are undergoing apoptosis [38].

We next investigated the potential role of HDAC2 in
cisplatin response. PE01 cells were treated with cisplatin
after HDAC2 knockdown (Figure 6B). HDAC2 was
consistently upregulated at 24 h and downregulated at
later time points in response to cisplatin without HDAC2
knockdown. Unsurprisingly, the induction of doublestrand breaks (DSBs) indicated by γH2AX expression
occurred as early as 6 h, while γH2AX expression
increased after 24 h of cisplatin treatment in cells depleted
of HDAC2 compared to cisplatin-treated or HDAC2
knockdown groups. This accumulation diminished over
72 h. As expected, pBRCA1, pATM, pATR, and Rad51
participated in the DNA damage response triggered by
cisplatin at certain time points (6h, 24h, 48h, and 24h) and
were upregulated. In contrast, cisplatin reduced expression
of these proteins in cells with HDAC2 knockdown from
24h to 72h (Figure 6B).

Figure 5. Time-dependent expression of DNA damage response proteins in PEO1 cells. Cells were seeded and treated with

or without cisplatin (6μM), and protein lysates were collected every 24h after treatment from 0h to 96h. Western blotting was performed to
detect expression of pBRCA1, γH2AX, pATM, ATM, pATR, and ATR. Membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies, and tubulin
was used as a loading control. Experiments were performed at least three times acquiring similar results. Blots from one representative
experiment are shown.

Role of HDAC2 in γH2AX foci formation during
cisplatin treatment

The cisplatin-resistant PEO4 cell line was next
studied to further clarify the involvement of HDAC2
during cisplatin-induced DNA damage responses
(Supplementary Figure 2). There was little change
in HDAC2 expression in PEO4 cells during cisplatin
treatment, except for decreased expression at 72 h.
In contrast to PEO1 cells, the cumulative effect of
HDAC2 depletion and cisplatin treatment on γH2AX
was not observed in PEO4 cells, although induction
of DSBs was noted from 24 h in response to cisplatin
alone. Additionally, pBRCA1, pATM, and RAD51 were
upregulated by cisplatin treatment alone. Expression
of these proteins was suppressed by HDAC2 depletion,
although the pattern of expression over time was different
to PEO1 cells.

γH2AX foci at DNA damaged domains are
indicative of inter-strand crosslinking by cisplatin [39].
The detection of ser139-phosphorylated γH2AX foci has
been widely used to evaluate double-strand breaks (DSBs)
[40]. Therefore, γH2AX foci were targeted and visualised
using immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 7). γH2AX
foci were formed in PEO1 (Figure 7) and PE04 cells in
response to cisplatin (Supplementary Figure 3). Similarly,
HDAC2 knockdown resulted in γH2AX foci in both cell
lines (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure 3). There was
a marked increase (number and intensity) in γH2AX
foci in PEO1 cells treated with cisplatin after HDAC2

Figure 6. The effect of siHDAC2 knockdown on expression of other HDAC family members, HP1s, and DNA damage
response proteins by western blotting in PEO1 cells alone (A) and in the presence / absence of cisplatin (B). Protein was

lysed after HDAC2 was knocked down after 72 h using reverse transfection. Non-transfection (control), mock, and siRNA negative control
were used as controls. Membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies, and tubulin was used as a loading control. Experiments were
performed at least three times acquiring similar results. Blots from one representative experiment are shown. In (B), cells were treated with
cisplatin (6μM) after 72h incubation with mock (lane 1), siRNA negative control (lane 2), or HDAC2 siRNA duplexes (10pmol in 6mL,
lane 3). Protein lysates were collected at 6h, 24h, 48h, and 72h after cisplatin treatment and analysed by western blotting of DNA damage
response proteins; tubulin was used as loading control. Experiments were performed at least three time acquiring similar results. Blots from
one representative experiment are shown.

knockdown, which was less pronounced in PEO4 cells,
similar to cisplatin alone (Supplementary Figure 3). Using
a cut-point of five foci per cell as negative background, the
number of foci-positive PEO1 cells significantly increased
after cisplatin treatment, HDAC2 knockdown, and
cisplatin treatment in HDAC2-depleted cells (p<0.05 and
0.01 compared to cisplatin-treated and siRNA-transfected
groups, respectively; Figure 7). In PE04 cells, cisplatin
induced foci (p<0.001), while HDAC2 knockdown
did not.

induced by cisplatin in PEO1 cell (+120%, p<0.05) and
an additional reduction in G1 phase cells (-20%, p<0.001).
In contrast, HDAC2 depletion seemed to reduce S-phase
accumulation (-20%, p<0.001) and increase the G1-phase
population (+140%, p<0.05) based on measurements of
cisplatin treated cells without transfection.
We next analysed the effect of cisplatin and HDAC2
knockdown on apoptosis (Figure 8C). Cisplatin induced
early apoptosis (annexin V positive only) (p<0.001).
HDAC2 knockdown caused both early and late apoptosis
(p<0.001). Furthermore, HDAC2 depletion induced
significant (especially early) apoptosis after cisplatin
treatment (p<0.001).

Cell fate determination by HDAC2 knockdown
during cisplatin treatment
We assessed the effect of HDAC2 knockdown on
cell fate with and without cisplatin treatment. Growth
inhibition by cisplatin was concentration dependent
manner in both control HDAC2 knockdown groups in
PEO1 cells (Figure 8A). Cisplatin treatment alone induced
significant S-phase arrest in PEO1 cells (+160%, p<0.001)
and decreased the number of G1-phase cells (-30%;
p<0.05) (Figure 8B). HDAC2 knockdown alone increased
the S phase population (+120%, p<0.05). As expected,
cisplatin treatment in HDAC2-depleted cells altered the
cell cycle distribution in PEO1 cells, but in a different
way: HDAC2 knockdown caused further S-phase arrest

Reversibility of HDAC inhibition on nuclear
morphological changes during cisplatin
treatment
To test if the nuclear structural changes were
mediated by HDACs, then specifically HDAC2,
we investigated whether the nuclear changes were
reversible by applying either the broad-spectrum HDAC
inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) or HDAC2 siRNA in
PEO1 cells. When PEO1 cells were treated with TSA,
all five texture parameters were altered: angular second
moment, correlation, and inverse difference moment

used to probe cellular γH2AX foci (red channel), and DAPI was applied for nuclear staining (blue channel). A. Representative images from
one experiment are shown. >100 cells in each group were included for one experiment, and three independent experiments were performed.

following chemotherapy both in vivo and in vitro. HDAC2
was upregulated after 24h of cisplatin treatment in
vitro, with similar results seen in vivo in ovarian cancer
xenografts. In line with its function as a regulator of
condensed chromatin formation, HDAC2 expression
changed consistent with the observed changes in nuclear
texture and was a possible mediator of the DNA damage
response. This alteration in chromatin pattern might
also indicate that chemotherapy induces transcriptional
silencing, perhaps as a form of cellular self-protection
upon injury. There is evidence that HDAC-containing
complexes including Mi-2/NuRD and/or Sin3/HDAC
chromatin-modifying complex (containing HDAC1 and
HDAC2) participate in nuclear reorganisation and gene
repression during development [44]. Mi-2/NuRD and
mSin3/HDAC co-repressor complexes are also necessary
for pericentric heterochromatin assembly and chromosome
segregation [45, 46].
There were time-dependent changes in the
expression of DNA damage response proteins including
pBRCA1, γH2AX, pATM, and pATR after cisplatin
treatment in PEO1 cells. As a marker of double strand
breaks, elevated γH2AX expression indicated activation
of DSB repair pathways in response to cisplatin treatment
in PEO1 cells; there is evidence to show that the tumor
suppressor function of BRCA1 occurs via heterochromatin
silencing, with increased levels of both heterochromatin
and BRCA1 observed after DNA damage [47]. Our
results are consistent with these findings, and suggest
that chromatin remodelling by HDACs is involved in the

increased, while entropy and contrast decreased (Figure
9A). Decreased chromatin heterogeneity and contrast
and increased homogeneity are consistent with HDAC
inhibition relaxing the chromatin structure. With HDAC2
siRNA (Figure 9B), comparable changes to TSA were
observed.

DISCUSSION
Within this study, we show that comparable nuclear
morphological changes occur in several ovarian tumor
models (cell lines and xenografts) after treatment-induced
cellular damage. Image analysis of nuclear texture has
previously been used to differentiate between benign and
malignant cancers [28], examine apoptotic cells [41],
and study the condensation and distribution of chromatin
in the nucleus in drug-sensitive and resistant cells [42].
In the present study, increased nuclear heterogeneity
was assumed to indicate a transition from euchromatin
to heterochromatin. Consistent with this, HP1 isoform
expression increased after cisplatin treatment in vitro,
which was accompanied by enhanced expression of
HDAC2 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Studies
in vivo using a patient-derived ovarian cancer xenograft
model also showed elevated HDAC2 and HP1 isoform
expression after chemotherapy.
As an essential component of heterochromatin,
HP1 accumulates in response to UV or ionising radiation
consistent with chromatin reorganisation [43]. We obtained
a similar result, with enhanced heterochromatin formation

cellular response to DNA damage therapy such as double
strand break and DNA repair.
HDACs are associated with malignancy and poor
clinical outcomes in multiple cancer types [13, 17].
Roles for HDAC2 have been identified in a variety of
malignancies. In colon cancer cells, HDAC2 expression
has been associated with chemoresistance to genotoxic
stress [48]. In neuroblastoma, HDAC2 has been show
to act with N-MYC to reduce TP53INP1 expression
which influences p53 phosphorylation at serine 46, with
subsequent effects on cell proliferation and survival [49].

In leukemia, HDAC2 silencing induces modulation of
gene expression leading to strong transcriptional activation
[50] while in lung cancer, HDAC2 has been proposed to
exert an effect on survival by sustaining Mdm2-survivin
levels [51]. A number of studies have demonstrated
efficacy of combined HDAC inhibitor and cytotoxic
chemotherapy. The HDAC inhibitor romidepsin (FK228),
approved for phase I and II trials, enhances the cytotoxic
effects of cisplatin by reducing cell growth and inducing
more DNA damage-induced cell death in vitro and in vivo
[52]. Since HDAC2 in particular was associated with

early responses to cisplatin in our cell culture studies, cell
growth was evaluated in response to HDAC2 knockdown.
HDAC2 depletion reduced the IC50 of cisplatin in PEO1
cells, suggesting that HDAC2 loss enhances the effect of
cisplatin treatment. Repression of cell growth in chemosensitive PEO1 cells by cisplatin after HDAC2 silencing
appeared to be due to accumulated S-phase arrest and
apoptosis.
Cell cycle progression blockade has been reported
to occur as a result of checkpoint activation during DNA
damage-based therapy, and at least one checkpoint protein,
Chk1, is upregulated during intra-S-phase accumulation
by affecting chromatin formation and interfering with the
initiation and elongation of DNA replication [53]. It is
feasible that HDAC2 interacts with checkpoint proteins
to prevent DNA replication by condensing the chromatin
in self-protection, and triggers apoptosis via distinct
pathways in platinum sensitive and resistant cells. Several
mechanisms have been suggested to explain HDAC
inhibitor-induced apoptosis, such as altered transcription
and DDR and DNA damage repair [54-56]. The early
upregulation (after 24 h) of HDAC2 in sensitive cells
may suggest that HDAC2 is acting as a sensor of DNA
damage and a trigger of downstream DDR events (such
as activation of ATM, ATR, and BRCA1) and chromatin
remodelling, followed by histone hyperacetylation to relax
the chromatin structure and facilitate recruitment of more
DDR mediators to the damaged site.
DSBs (measured by γH2AX) accumulated after 24 h
of cisplatin treatment in HDAC2-depleted PEO1 cells, but
not PEO4 cells. High γH2AX expression has previously
been associated with cell viability and apoptosis in ovarian
cancer [57], which was attributed to the cell type tested
and time after damage. H2AX activation has also been
noted a number of days after treatment with an HDAC
inhibitor, suggesting that increased γH2AX expression
precedes cancer cell death [58]. Suppression of DDR
activation (as evidenced by pATM, pATR, pBRCA1, and
RAD51 expression) after HDAC2 knockdown strongly
suggests that HDAC2 is involved in responses to DNA
damage-based treatment. The differences between PEO1
and PEO4 cells in DSB accumulation and time of pathway
activation or suppression is consistent with the observed
differences in cell cycle progression, and also might be
due their differences in cisplatin sensitivity. The two major
pathways of DSB repair, non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), appear to
compensate for each other [59], and their balance might
be disrupted by the known BRCA2 deficiency in PEO1
and secondary mutation to restore BRCA2 in PE04 [60].
This might influence the dominant mechanism of repair
in the two cell lines and cause differences in the observed
functional activity of the measured DNA damage response
proteins after cisplatin treatment.
Together, these results suggest that chromatin
remodelling caused by increased HDAC2 expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

might be an early cellular event (within 24 h) in response
to DNA damage. We postulate that, in sensitive tumors,
early alterations in chromatin induced by chemotherapy
and mediated by histone deacetylation are a form of
cellular self-defence to injury by repressing transcription,
initiating chemotherapy-triggered DDR, and promoting
survival. This is followed by a change to a relaxed
chromatin conformation by histone hyperacetylation, such
as via H3k56Ac and H4k16Ac, to provide accessibility
of DNA to downstream proteins at damaged sites [61 63]. However, resistant tumors behave differently in terms
of their response to DNA damage to chemotherapy; this
might be due to their initial chromatin environment or due
to other changes in the components of the DDR response
pathways in which HDACs participate. In one study,
HDAC1/2-associated immediate histone hypoacetylation
occurred after laser microirradiation of a human
osteosarcoma cell line to promote NHEJ, which was
followed by hypoacetylation to enhance HR and guard
genome integrity [64], supporting our hypothesis. Linkage
between HDAC2 modulation and H4k16 acetylation has
been shown in breast cancer [65].
By identifying the detailed roles that HDACs play
in DNA damage responses by remodelling chromatin, we
hope to better understand the molecular processes that
underpin nuclear structure and identify novel mechanisms
that control responses to chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Cisplatin-sensitive PE01 and cisplatin-resistant
PE04 ovarian cancer cell lines derived in our laboratory
[30] were cultured as monolayers in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum
(FCS) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/mL) in 5% CO2
at 37°C.

Ovarian cancer xenografts
Two ovarian cancer patient-derived xenograft
models were previously established in our laboratory:
OV1002 and HOX424 [66]. Female adult CD-1 nude
mice housed in individually ventilated cages were treated
with carboplatin (50 mg/kg i.p.) on day 0, and tumor
samples were collected on days 0, 1, 4, 7, and 14 after
treatment. Tumors were formalin fixed and paraffin
embedded (FFPE). The OV1002 xenograft model was
markedly more sensitive to carboplatin treatment than the
HOX424 model [31]. Xenograft studies were undertaken
under a UK Home Office Project Licence in accordance
with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and
the University of Edinburgh Animal Ethics Committee
approved the study protocol.

Nuclear texture analysis

Protein extraction from mammalian cell lines

Confocal microscopy images were obtained using
a Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope (Nikon Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan) and images were viewed in NIS Viewer
(Nikon). Cells were grown on chamber slides for the
periods specified and fixed in 10% formalin in PBS for 10
min. After washing three times with PBS-0.05% Tween
20, slides were counterstained with anti-fade reagent with
DAPI (Invitrogen, P36931; Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). Nuclear texture was analysed using Image
J software. Briefly, after input of 8-bit images, fully focused
areas containing tumor cells were marked as regions of
interest (ROI) and individual nuclei selected. Nucleus
counter and GLCM (grey-level co-occurrence matrix) [67]
manager plugins were performed on each image and five
parameters associated with texture obtained: correlation,
contrast, angular second moment (ASM), inverse different
moment (IDM), and entropy. GLCM [67, 68] is a secondorder texture calculation that considers the distance and
angle relationship between two-pixel groups in the original
greyscale image under the same intensity of grey pixels
within a defined area. Texture features were regarded as
positively or negatively associated with chromatin patterns
(homogeneity, heterogeneity, and contrast) as previously
described [28, 29].

Cultured cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed
by scraping in ice-cold isotonic lysis buffer (50mM TrisHCl (pH7.5), 5mM EGTA (pH 8.5), 150mM NaCl, 1%
Triton X-100) supplemented with aprotinin (10 μg/mL)
and a cOmpleteTM Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet
(Roche, 11836153001) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were
centrifuged for 6 min at 13,000 × g and the supernatant
stored at -70°C. Protein concentrations were determined
using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Sigma, BCA-1;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Western blotting
After SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels,
resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes at 30V, 4°C overnight. After transfer,
membranes were rinsed in PBST and blocked with LiCor Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences,
Lincoln, NE; diluted 50:50 in PBS) for 1h at room
temperature before probing overnight at 4°C with
the appropriate primary antibody in Li-Cor Odyssey
Blocking Buffer. Primary antibodies were rabbit and
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA)
and used at 1:1000 unless otherwise indicated: anti-HP1
alpha (#2623), anti-HP1 beta (Abcam/ab10478), antiHP1 gamma (#2619), anti-HDAC1 (mouse, #5356),
anti-HDAC2 (#2540), anti-HDAC3 (Abcam (Cambridge,
UK) ab32369), anti-HDAC4 (Abcam ab32534), antiHDAC8 (Abcam ab39664), anti-AMT (1:750 Abcam
ab67998, mouse), anti-pATM (Ser1981; #4526), antiATR (Abcam ab2905), anti-pATR (Ser428; #2853),
anti-pBRCA1(Ser1524; #9009), anti-γH2AX (#2577),
anti-Rad51 (H-92) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX; sc-8349), anti-α-tubulin (1:6000 Mouse Abcam
ab7291), anti-β-tubulin (1:6000 Abcam ab6046), antiGAPDH (1:8000 Mouse Abcam ab8245). Membranes
were washed with PBS-Tween20 before incubation with
fluorescently-labelled secondary antibodies diluted in
Odyssey Blocking Buffer (50:50 in PBST) at 1:10,000
dilution. Mouse-derived primary antibodies were
detected using an anti-mouse fluorescently-labelled
secondary antibody (680nm wavelength), whilst rabbitderived primary antibodies were detected using an antirabbit fluorescently-labelled secondary antibody (800nm
wavelength) (45 min incubation). By combining a mouse
primary with a rabbit primary along with their respective
secondary antibodies, dual-labelled blots were obtained.
Membranes were scanned on the Li-Cor Odyssey
scanner, and the fluorescence value (integrated intensity,
I.I.) corresponded to protein expression levels. Alphatubulin (Mouse Abcam ab7291) was used as loading
control.

siRNA knockdown of HDAC2
Loss of HDAC2 function was achieved with
siRNA transfection of cells in 60mm cell culture dishes
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
siRNA duplex-Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX complexes
(Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were
prepared as follows. 10-100 pmol siRNA duplex
was diluted in 500μl Opti-MEM® I Medium (Life
Technologies) without serum in each cell culture
dish and mixed gently. The duplex sequences were:
GACAAACCAGAACACUCCAGAAUAU
and
AUAUUCUGGAGUGUUCUGGUUUGUC. A negative
scrambled stealth siRNA duplex with similar GC content
(low GC duplex) to the target was used as control. 0.8
μl Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX was added to each
dish containing diluted siRNAs and incubated at room
temperature for 20 min. After incubation, cells were
diluted in complete growth medium without antibiotics at
700,000 – 800,000 cells/5mL to ensure a cell density of
30-50% 24h after seeding, and 5 mL was added to each
well. Controls were untransfected (no transfection agents),
mock (only Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX mixture), and
negative control (random RNAi duplex). The cells and the
complexes were incubated for 24-120 h at 37ºC in full
serum without antibiotics. For drug treatment, cisplatin
was added after 48 h of transfection and cells were
collected after several time points as indicated.

RNA preparation and real time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR)

IF was analysed using the Automated QUantitative
Analysis (AQUA) system (HistoRx, New Haven, CT) as
previously described [69]. For each immunofluorescence
image, AQUAnalysis software evaluated the quantity (in
AQUA units=Au) of target protein expression (through
Cy-5-tyramide) within the cytoplasm (identified by
cytokeratin) and nuclei (DAPI). Images were examined
to exclude imaging faults and normal tissue, thus target
protein expression was scored only in invasive cancers.
Cores containing <5% epithelium were automatically
excluded to ensure tissues were representative of tumors
[70]. The final normalised AQUA score detecting the
fluorescence correlates with the expression level of target
protein.

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells
using the Qiagen Mini RNeasy Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Limburg, NL).
The concentration and quality of RNA were assessed by
NanoDrop. 1μg of total RNA from each individual sample
was reverse transcribed using the QuantiTect Reverse
Transcription kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions to produce 20μL of cDNA, which was
quantified using Rotorgene (Corbett Research, San
Francisco, CA) and the QuantiTect SYBR Green system
(Qiagen) following the manufacturers’ instructions. For
PCR, a 13-fold dilution of the cDNA mixture (10-fold
dilution for standard curve) and a 10-fold dilution of
primers for HDAC8 and β-actin (Qiagen) were used. A
15ul mixture of 7.5μl 2xQuantiTect SYBR Green iMaster
Mix, 1.5 μL primer mix (0.3 μM), 2.5mM of MgCl2, and
1.5 μL cDNA was prepared in RNase-free water for the
PCR reactions. PCR was performed as follows: 95°C for
15min; 45 cycles at 94°C for 15s, 56°C for 30s, 72°C for
30s; 72°C for 5min followed by melting from 55°C to
95°C at 0.2°C/s.

Sulforhodamine B cell proliferation assay
Cells were harvested in log phase, counted using
a haemocytometer, and optimal initial numbers of cells
in 200 uL per well were seeded into 96 well cell culture
plates for 72h. After 0 to 6 days incubation with small
molecules, cells were fixed in 25% cold trichloroacetic
acid (50uL/well), and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Plates
were washed, air-dried, and stained with sulforhodamine
B dye (0.4% solution in 1% acetic acid, 50 μl/well) for 30
min. After washing with 1% acetic acid, plates were dried.
100uL Tris buffer (10mM, pH 10.5) was added into each
well 1 h prior to reading and the optical density (OD) was
recorded using a Biohit BP800 Microplate reader (Biohit,
Helsinki, Finland) at 540 nm.

Immunofluorescence (IF) on xenografts
4μm TMA sections were deparaffinised in xylene for
5 min and rehydrated through graded ethanol. For antigen
retrieval, sections were treated with 0.15mM sodium
citrate, pH 6.0 or Tris-EDTA, pH9.0 using a microwave
pressure cooker for 5 min. Sections were rinsed in 0.05%
PBST, blocked in 3% hydrogen peroxide and serumfree protein block (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; #X0909),
10 min each. After blocking, slides were incubated with
primary antibodies diluted in second primary antibody
(mouse anti-cytokeratin, Invitrogen, #18-0132) in Dako
antibody diluents (1:25) for 1h at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies were rabbit from
Cell Signaling unless otherwise indicated: anti-HP1 alpha
(#2623; 1:100 dilution), anti-HP1 beta (Abcam ab10478;
1:150), anti-HP1 gamma (#2619; 1:400 dilution), antiHDAC1 (mouse #5356; 1:25 dilution), anti-HDAC2
(#2540; 1/100 dilution), anti-HDAC3 (Abcam ab32369;
1/100 dilution), anti-HDAC4 (Abcam/ab32534; 1/100
dilution) and anti-HDAC8 (Abcam/ab39664; 1/100
dilution). Sections were rinsed in 0.05% PBST three
times followed by incubation with secondary antibodies
for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:25 dilution of goatanti-mouse Alexa 555 antibody (Invitrogen, #A21422).
After rinsing, sections were incubated with target signal
amplification diluents and Cy5 tyramide at 1:50 in the dark
for 10 min at room temperature for target visualisation.
Finally, slides were rinsed, dehydrated in 80% ethanol for
1 min, air dried in the dark, and counterstained and coverslipped using Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI
(Invitrogen, P36931).

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were harvested and plated as described for
western blotting. At the time points indicated, cells
were trypsinised and transferred to 5 mL BD Falcon
tubes (BD Biosciences). Citrate buffer (trisodium citrate
(301287F, BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, UK),
121mg Tris Base (T1378, Sigma), 1044 mg spermine
tetrahydrochloride (S2876, Sigma) and 2mL Nonidet
NP40 (N3516, Sigma) in 2000mL distilled water, pH7.6)
was added after centrifugation. The following solutions
were added in sequence prior to analysis: 450uL solution
A (0.003% trypsin type IX-S (T0303, Sigma) in citrate
buffer, pH7.6) for 2 min, solution B (0.05% trypsin
inhibitor (T9253, Sigma) and 0.01% RNAse A (R4875,
Sigma) in citrate buffer pH7.6) for 10 min, and solution
C (0.0416% propidium iodide (81845, Sigma) and 0.1%
spermine tetrahydrochloride (S2876, Sigma) in 500 mL
citrate buffer pH7.6) for 10 min in the dark. Apoptosis was
detected at 24 h using the TACS Annexin V-FITC Kits (R
&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Flow cytometry was performed using a BD FACSAriaII
SORP (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). BD
FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson, Version 6.1.2)
was used for instrument control and Flowjo software
(Version 7.6.5) for Data analysis.

Cells were grown and stained as described above
using anti-phospho-histone H2AX (ser139, γH2AX;
Millipore 05-636) primary antibody. After mounting
with DAPI and air-drying, cells were visualised with
a BriteMAC or MacRd microscope. Nuclear images
were taken with IPLab software with single filters for
each channel and the same exposure for each set of
experiments. For each slide, over 100 nuclei were counted
for foci formation. The number of γH2AX foci in each
nucleus was counted by the PZ Foci EZ plugin in ImageJ
as described (available at www.pzfociez.com). Briefly,
a nuclear mask defining ROIs was first created for each
channel, and then the foci number was automatically
counted in the channel within the defined ROI.
