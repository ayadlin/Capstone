ABSTRACT
Stress has an emerging role in cancer and targeting stress-related β-adrenergic
receptors (AR) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach in melanoma.
Here we report that β3-AR expression correlates with melanoma aggressiveness. In
addition, we highlight that β3-AR expression is not only restricted to cancer cells, but
it is also expressed in vivo in stromal, inflammatory and vascular cells of the melanoma
microenvironment. Particularly, we demonstrated that β3-AR can (i)  instruct
melanoma cells to respond to environmental stimuli, (ii) enhance melanoma cells
response to stromal fibroblasts and macrophages, (iii) increase melanoma cell motility
and (iv) induce stem-like traits. Noteworthy, β3-AR activation in melanoma accessory
cells drives stromal reactivity by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion and
de novo angiogenesis, sustaining tumor growth and melanoma aggressiveness.
β3-ARs also play a mandatory role in the recruitment to tumor sites of circulating
stromal cells precursors, in the differentiation of these cells towards different
lineages, further favoring tumor inflammation, angiogenesis and ultimately melanoma
malignancy. Our findings validate selective β3-AR antagonists as potential promising
anti-metastatic agents. These could be used to complement current therapeutic
approaches for melanoma patients (e.g. propranolol) by targeting non-neoplastic
stromal cells, hence reducing therapy resistance of melanoma.

cells have been associated to β-adrenergic receptors
subfamily (β-ARs), composed of three members that
signal through distinct downstream pathways [2, 3].
The three subtypes of β-ARs, β1, β2, and β3, are widely
expressed in different tumors, such as those of the brain,
lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, breast, ovary, prostate
or lymphoid tissues [4–7]. We have recently reported that

primary melanoma cells express both β1 and β2-ARs and
that β2-ARs are up-regulated in metastatic melanoma, with
a strong correlation with malignancy  [4]. β3-AR plays
a key role in the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular
system and has been recently correlated with de novo
angiogenesis in models of retinal vascular proliferation
[8–10]. Moreover, β3-AR mRNA aberrant expression
has been reported in human cancers, such as leukemia,
vascular tumors and colon carcinoma [5, 11, 12]. Recently,
β3-ARs has been found to be expressed by murine
melanoma B16F10 cells and by endothelial cells of the
tumor vasculature [13, 14]. Finally, beside deregulation
of β3-ARs expression, Trp64Arg β3-AR polymorphism
has been associated with susceptibility to endometrial and
breast cancers [15, 16].
Although epidemiological data are still contradictory,
preclinical studies suggest that β-blockers favorably impact
on disease progression in several types of cancers, mainly
by reducing metastases, tumor recurrence and mortality,
[17–19]. In keeping with this, we have previously
demonstrated a significant activation of pro-tumorigenic
biological responses induced by catecholamines in
melanoma cells, severely inhibited by propranolol, a nonselective inhibitor that can block β-ARs  [4]. Although
propranolol is able to impair key features of melanoma
malignancy, such as proliferation, motility, secretion
of metalloproteases, invasiveness and secretion of proangiogenic and pro-inflammatory cytokines, the specific
contribution of β-ARs in controlling these cellular events
is still unknown. The ability of catecholamines to induce
in melanoma cells the expression of the pro-inflammatory
and pro-angiogenic interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin 8
(IL-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
prompted us to study the role of β-AR functions within
tumor microenvironment [20, 21]. Indeed, tumor
progression is a multistep process controlled by the crosstalk between tumor and stromal cells. Stromal cells can be
either resident or recruited to tumor site from circulating
bone marrow precursors to sustain tumor growth and to
orchestrate vasculogenesis, lymphoangiogenesis and
inflammation [22–24]. The microenvironment supporting
tumors progression is composed by endothelial cells,
cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages (CAFs and
CAMs), tumor associated lymphocytes and neuthrophils
[25–27]. Catecholamines are released locally by
sympathetic nerve fibers or can be found circulating in the
blood. Although β-ARs could be activated on both tumor
and stromal cells by catecholamines, data on the role of
these receptors within the tumor microenvironment are
needed to develop innovative therapeutic approaches.
Herein we investigated the role of several
cell populations that compose the melanoma
microenvironment (i.e. melanoma-associated fibroblasts,
macrophages, endothelial cells and bone marrow
derived mesenchymal cells) during cancer progression.
Our  findings indicate a differential involvement of β2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and β3-ARs in the recruitment and differentiation of
circulating precursors of stromal cells by the tumor. This
recruitment sustains tumor inflammation, angiogenesis
and ultimately promotes melanoma malignancy. Finally,
our data validate selective β-blockers as effective drugs to
target both autonomous and non-autonomous oncogenic
pathways in advanced melanoma.

RESULTS
β3-ARs expression in tissue samples
We have previously described the role of β2ARs in melanoma [4]. Here we wanted to address the
role of β3-ARs expression in melanoma malignancy.
Consequently, we investigated β3-ARs expression in a
cohort of human samples of common melanocytic nevi
(CN), atypical melanocytic nevi (AN), in situ primary
melanoma (ISM), superficial spreading melanoma (SSM),
nodular melanoma (NM) and cutaneous and lymph-nodal
metastatic melanoma (MM). β3-AR was expressed,
although at various levels, in all examined melanocytic
lesions. The immunostaining of each group, taking into
account both staining intensity and percentage of positive
cells (both composing the score), is shown in Table 1.
Score 1 was observed in all CN and AN but one (AN)
which expressed score 2, and in all ISM but one, which
showed score 2. Score 2 was detected in all SSM and
NM but one NM, which exhibited score 3. MM showed
score 3 in four cases and score 2 in six cases. β3-AR score
was significantly higher in malignant lesions compared to
nevi (p = 0.000068). ISM + SSM exhibited a significantly
lower score compared to NM+MM (p = 0.0087), and no
difference was observed between CN and AN. The cell
staining intensity of melanocytic/melanoma cells was
constantly weak, and moderate in only 3 metastases.
Representative β3-AR IHC pictures of melanocytic
lesions are shown in Fig. 1A. Beside melanoma cells,
stromal cells show strong immunoreactivity. Granular
layer of the epidermis, epidermal keratinocytes and
dermal fibroblasts always showed strong positive reaction.
Moreover, endothelial cells appeared to be stained in
all sections. Macrophages and lymphocytic infiltrate
exhibited reactivity only in invasive malignant lesions
(Fig. 1B, C).
Taken together, our data show that β3-AR is
expressed in human melanocytic lesions with a significant
up-regulation in malignant and advanced malignant
lesions. Importantly, β3-AR was expressed in stromal,
endothelial and inflammatory cells (Fig. 1B, C).

Tumor microenvironment is also constituted
by several accessory cells that may help and sustain
melanoma progression. We studied the effect of several
accessory cells, commonly present in solid tumors, on
β2/3-ARs expression: i) macrophages polarized in vitro
toward the antitumoral phenotype M1 or toward the protumoral M2 phenotype [28]; ii) HDFs, activated in vitro
by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β) to behave as
MFs; iii) HUVECs and EPCs, as endothelial precursors.
Endothelial cells were also exposed to 1% O2 hypoxia and
their conditioned medium was then used to treat A375
melanoma cells for 24 h to mimic intratumoral hypoxia.
Our results reveal that accessory cells are not able to affect
β2-ARs, but they are extremely successful in upregulating
β3-ARs expression (Fig. 2D, E, F, G). In particular, HDFs,
M2 macrophages and EPCs cells are the most efficient in
enhancing β3-ARs expression levels, while exposure to
hypoxia is able to strengthen the response of all accessory
cells, including HUVECs (Fig. 2F).
The vast majority of cutaneous melanomas show
activating mutations in BRAF proto-oncogenes, sustaining
proliferative stimuli [29, 30]. A375 cell lines are therefore
a representative model of such melanoma subtype, since
they show BRAF V600E mutation (REF). In order to study
the role of β-AR expression and activation in these cells,
we examined the activation of the extracellular regulated
kinase (ERK) pathway in response to NE stimulation, in
the presence or absence of the β3-AR-blocker SR59230A,
the β2-AR-blocker IC118551, as well as the non-selective
β-AR-blocker propranolol. The results suggest that ligand
stimulation of β-ARs by NE is able to enhance basal
ERK1/2 activation. Importantly, all β-AR blockers tested
revert this effect, although inhibition of β3-AR appears
to be the most effective. In addition, we also confirmed
these results by RNA interference of β2 and β3-ARs
(Supplementary Fig. 1).

The results suggested a role of β3-AR in recruiting not
only fibroblasts (both HDFs and MAFs) but also MSCs
and monocytes (Fig. 3A,  B, E, F). Conversely, β3-AR
and β2-AR have similar the recruiting abilities towards
endothelial cells (Fig. 3C,  D). Accordingly, only high
doses of propranolol are active on recruitment of stromal
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). To exclude a possible role of
α1-ARs in attracting stromal cells in vitro, we performed
HDFs and HUVECs recruitment by conditioned medium
of NE-treated A375 cells, using the selective α1-adrenergic
antagonist prazosin. As expected, prazosin has no effect
on both HDFs and HUVECs recruitment by NE-treated
melanoma cells (Supplementary Fig. 4A-B).

β3-AR drives accessory cells reactivity and
enhances melanoma:fibroblasts cross-talk
CAFs have been shown to undergo an activation
due to contact with cancer cells, consisting in their ability
to behave as myofibroblasts, contracting collagen fibers
through expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)
and secreting several pro-inflammatory and proangiogenic
cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, VEGF-A, FGF-2 [24, 26].
Both HDFs and MAFs were analyzed for their activation
in response to NE treatment. The results indicate that: i)
MAFs show a strong basal α-SMA expression, suggesting
an activation of these fibroblasts due to the fact that they
are derived from aggressive cancers, ii) both HDFs and
MAFs react to NE by increasing their expression of
α-SMA, although MAFs are less sensitive (Fig. 4A, B).
Importantly, β3-ARs appear to play the main role in
the regulation of stromal reactivity, as revealed by
β2/β3/α1-AR selective antagonists on α-SMA expression
(Fig. 4A, B, Supplementary. Fig. 4C).
MSCs recruited to tumor sites have been shown to
escort resident CAFs, as well as endothelial cells in their
protumoral function, due to their ability to differentiate
into fibroblasts or to orchestrate vessel-like structures
[31, 32]. Our results indicate that human bone marrowderived MSCs respond to NE treatment with an increase
in expression of both α-SMA and VEGF receptor-2
(VEGFR-2) (Fig. 4C), as well as with an enhancement of
their ability to form vessel-like structures in a capillary
morphogenesis assay (Fig. 4D).
Stromal reactivity due to tumor progression enhances
the production of several cytokines by resident fibroblasts
[33]. In keeping with this, NE is able to induces enhanced
expression of IL-6, IL-8, VEGF-A and FGF-2 mRNAs
(Fig. 4E), thereby indicating that the acknowledged ability
of fibroblasts to orchestrate de novo angiogenesis in vitro
and to sustain inflammation is enhanced upon catecholamine
release. We also observed that IL-6 and VEGF-A are able to
enhance the expression of β3-AR in melanoma cells, while
β2-AR is upregulated by IL-8, FGF-2 and VEGF-A, thereby
suggesting a feed-forward loop between NE and its cognate
receptors β3/ β2-ARs (Fig. 4F).

β-ARs in vitro activation drives the recruitment
of stromal cells to primary melanoma
The ability of primary melanoma cells to recruit
accessory cells in response to ligand activation of
β3-AR has been assessed by transwell chemotaxis assay.
We used HDF and fibroblasts derived from human primary
melanoma (MAFs). Conditioned medium derived from
A375 cells stimulated with norepinephrine (NE) for
24 h elicits an increase in recruitment of HDFs, MAFs,
HUVECs, as well as MSCs, EPCs and monocytes (Fig. 3)
when compared to conditioned medium derived from
unstimulated A375. Ligand stimulation is a mandatory
step for these recruitments. Indeed, to definitely identify
the differential role of β2 and β3-ARs, we used two
different approaches; a pharmacological one by treating
cells with selective β-AR blockers (i.e. ICI118-551
for β2-AR and SR-59230A for β3-AR) or by RNA
interfering with the two β-ARs (Supplementary Fig. 2).

β-ARs expression/activation in cancer cells
enhances their invasiveness and stem-cell
traits, as well as the ability to favor capillary
morphogenesis of endothelial cells

melanoma:fibroblasts co-cultures. Quantum-dots-labelled
melanoma cells were kept in co-culture for 48 h with
HDFs and stimulate with NE. The results indicate that
the contact with HDFs enhances the invasive ability of
melanoma cells (Fig. 5B). The involvement of specific
β-ARs has been addressed using the specific β-blockers.
Noteworthy, SR59230A is able to completely revert
the ability of CAF contact to elicit invasiveness, while
ICI118-551 is mostly ineffective (Fig. 5B).
Second, we also assayed the capillary morphogenesis
of HUVECs and EPCs upon contact with NE-treated
melanoma:fibroblasts co-coltures. Conditioned medium
from NE-treated co-cultures of melanoma cells:HDFs
were used in a capillary morphogenesis assay, as an
indication of endothelial cells commitment towards
tube-like structures-forming cells. We used mature
endothelial cells as HUVECs and EPCs, isolated from the
blood of 3 human umbilical cords and immunophenotyped
by flow cytometry [34]. Mature endothelial cells have
been reported to drive de novo angiogenesis, while EPCs
have been correlated with vasculogenesis, organized by
tumor-recruited precursors [35]. The results show that
NE strongly enhances the pro-angiogenic properties
of melanoma:HDFs co-cultures (Fig. 6A, B). The
involvement of β-ARs has been addressed using the
specific β-blockers ICI-118-551 and SR59230A. Both
antagonists decrease tube-like structure formation for both
mature and precursors endothelial, although with a main
implication of β3-ARs (Fig. 6A, B).

To determine the involvement of β-ARs activation
within the tumor:stroma milieu, we decided to analyze
in vitro three key functions played by stromal cells,
i.e. the pro-invasive and pro-angiogenic spur given by
activated-stromal cells in in vitro co-cultures, as well as
the ability to enhance stem-like traits in cancer cells. We
therefore tested the sensitivity of melanoma cells to NE,
to CM of HDFs activated with NE or to the combination
of the two treatments. Indeed, we speculated that the
combination of NE-stimulation of HDFs and of melanoma
cells, once they have contacted NE-activated stromal
HDFs and they have undergone enhanced expression of
β-ARs, should maximize malignancy of melanoma cells.
In this experimental setting, we assayed the ability of
melanoma cells to move in a transwell assay. The results
clearly indicate that HDFs stimulated with NE elicit a
motile spur in melanoma cells (Fig. 5A), likely due to
the ability of NE to activate fibroblasts to myofibroblastlike cells. Furthermore, the pro-migratory effect of NE on
melanoma and on HDFs is additive (Fig. 5A), suggesting
a wide function of NE stimulation in the melanoma:stroma
context.
To correlate this NE-driven mobility to melanoma
aggressiveness, we also carried out invasion assays of

DISCUSSION

Besides motile and vessel forming ability of
melanoma cells in response to NE administration, we
also investigated whether NE administration could
induce stem-like traits in cancer cells. The results
indicate that NE is able to increase expression of
stemness markers in melanoma cells, such as CD20 and
CD133 (Fig. 7A, B). P0 and P1 melanosphere formation
is an acknowledged feature of anchorage-independent
stem cells. NE administration is able to enhances
both melanosphere forming ability of A375, therefore
supporting the role of NE as a stem-like promoting
factor in melanoma (Fig. 7C, D). The use of selective
β-blockers suggest that β3-AR is the main receptor
involved in the melanosphere self-renewal ability of
A375 cells.
These findings collectively suggest that β3-AR
affects melanoma malignancy by acting on both cancer
cells and stromal populations in vitro, coordinating
angiogenic responses, as well as motility and stemcell traits.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Here we report that β-ARs are key molecular
players of melanoma aggressiveness and that their
function is not restricted to cancer cells, but these
receptors are strongly expressed and actively functional
in a large set of tumor associated cells, such as cancer
associated fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial
cells. Indeed, both β-ARs are overexpressed in
melanoma, with a clear correlation with malignancy. β3ARs appear to be the main responsible for instructing
melanoma cells to respond to environmental cell
signals, to sense cancer associated fibroblasts and
macrophages enhancing their motility and stem-like
traits. Moreover, several accessory cells also express
β3-AR and its functional activation plays an important
role in eliciting stromal reactivity, to sustain secretion
of proinflammatory cytokines and to drive de novo
angio/vasculogenesis. All these events are promoting
melanoma aggressiveness. Accordingly, patients-derived

tissue showed that β3-ARs is expressed in stromal,
inflammatory and vascular cells and this expression
positively correlates with melanoma malignancy.
It is widely accepted that tumor cells do not
proliferate and progress as isolated entities. In fact,
they rely on microenvironment support, which include
extracellular matrix and several supporting stromal cells.
Cancer cell microenvironment is a strong determinant for
metastatic potential [23, 24, 27]. Thus, during primary
tumor formation, tumor cells engage a complex collection
of mesenchymal cells, jointly forming the tumor-associated
stroma [31]. As tumor progression proceeds, the stromal
cells create a “reactive stroma” that releases a variety of
signals that induce changes in cancer cells phenotype.
This reactive stroma consists in CAFs, converted into
myofibroblasts by cancer cell-released factors, endothelial
cells forming blood-and lymph vessels, as well as
inflammatory cells (i.e. cancer associated macrophages)
that are recruited to tumor by cancer secreted chemokines.
All these host cells engage a continuous molecular crosstalk with cancer cells, secreting large amounts of factors
and cytokines that ultimately will influence invasion
ability and metastasis. Stromal cells can be resident,
i.e. activated mesenchymal/endothelial cells already
present within the tissue where the tumor occur, or
recruited by circulating precursors, mainly derived from
bone marrow-derived stem cells or monocytes [36–38].
Once activated by tumor-released factors, or recruited
by circulating precursors, these stromal cells are able
to exert protumoral effects. Indeed, in several cancer
models CAFs have been reported to induce invasiveness,
resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapic agents, as well
as to enhance the stem-cell traits of cancer cells, thereby
contributing to metastatic spread [39]. Herein, we include
NE within the large set of soluble factors that can enhance
stromal reactivity and recruit bone marrow precursors
(MSCs) to tumor site. So far these characteristics were
restricted to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6,
TGF-β and SDF-1. Our findings are therefore novel and
illustrate a novel interactive circuitry among melanoma
progression, inflammation and stress. β3-ARs are the
main effectors of MSCs recruitment, their differentiation
towards fibroblasts, as well as CAFs reactivity induction.
In keeping with the role played by CAFs in other cancer
models, we also observed that β3-ARs expression in CAFs
is mandatory to enhance invasiveness of melanoma cells,
as well as to enhance their stem-like traits (e.g. CD133
and CD20 expression and P1 melanospheres formation).
β-ARs are also involved in monocytes recruitment
induced by melanoma cells with a main involvement of
β3-ARs over β2-ARs. Once recruited to the tumor site,
monocytes differentiate into active macrophages, where
they may play a multifaceted role for tumor progression.
Indeed, M1 polarized macrophages are likely to play an
antitumoral response whereas M2-polarized macrophages

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have been associated with a chronic inflammatory
response that characterizes several highly malignant
neoplasiae [40, 41]. In particular, tumor infiltration
characterized by M2-polarized macrophages has been
associated with enhanced stromal fibroblasts reactivity
and angiogenesis, and hence with worst prognosis in
several cancers [37]. Here we reported that M2-polarized
macrophages contact induces β3-ARs expression in cancer
cells, whereas M1-polarized macrophages do not. It is
also plausible that β3-ARs could play a key role in the
management of the overall inflammatory response within
melanoma site. Indeed, catecholamine stimulation could
enhance melanoma cells release of cytokines, such as
IL-6, IL-8, VEGF-A and FGF-2, that sustain inflammatory,
angiogenic and motility tasks. In turn, these cytokines are
active on melanoma cells to enhance expression of β2-AR
and β3-AR, thereby closing the circuitry.
Our findings clearly indicate that β-ARs are
also involved in endothelial cells functions. First, the
contact with mature endothelial cells or bone marrow
derived endothelial precursors is able to induce
β3-ARs expression in melanoma cells, while β2-AR
levels appear to be unchanged. Catecholamine stimulation
is able to activate the recruitment by melanoma cells of
both mature and precursors endothelial cells with a clear
implication of β3-AR. In vitro capillary morphogenesis
assays suggest that β3-ARs are likely mediators in both
angiogenesis and vasculogenesis function, although the
contribution of β2-ARs is also relevant. In keeping with
the reported role of stromal fibroblasts in orchestrating
de novo angiogenesis in several cancer models [42–44],
HDFs activated by catecholamine administration drive this
β3-AR-dependent angiogenic response. Hence, there
is a clear synergy between tumor accessory cells
(e.g. fibroblasts and macrophages) and endothelial cells,
possibly sustained by the cross-talk among stress and
inflammatory factors, driving stromal reactivity and new
vessels formation. Both these last features are likely
exploited by malignant cells to succeed metastases.
Stress delivered catecholamines can reach the tumor
mass via circulating blood or via local sympathetic nerve
fibers [12, 45, 46]. In support of our data it has been
shown that chronic stress enhances progression of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia via β-adrenergic signaling and
β-blockers can inhibit tumor burden and dissemination
[12]. Importantly, the authors speculated that β-adrenergic
signaling may affect the interplay between cancer cells
and immune or microenvironmental cells, but they
did not provide mechanistic insight. Additionally, in a
model of pancreatic cancer, activation of β-adrenergic
signaling mimics effects similar to chronic stress, and
pharmacological β-block reverts these effects [47]. Our
results of β-ARs activation in tumor accessory cells are
novel and open new perspective for pharmacological
intervention to prevent melanoma metastases promoted by

stress. Indeed, several preclinical and observational studies
have suggested the possibility that β-ARs blockers, drugs
originally intended for the treatment of cardiovascular
disease, may provide new therapeutic opportunities for the
control of cancer progression, including that of melanoma,
breast and prostate cancers [48]. Notably, a great reduction
in the risk of disease progression with β-blockers has been
reported for melanoma patients [18, 49, 50]. Although
these studies have been recently questioned [51, 52],
they promisingly suggest a potential role for targeting
the β-AR pathway in melanoma patients, indicating the
need for randomized clinical trials. We herein emphasize
two key aspects that should be taken into account for
pharmacological intervention on melanoma: i) β3-AR
plays an important role in melanoma cell aggressiveness
suggesting selective β3-AR antagonists as important
agents in reducing stromal fibroblasts reactivity, ii) non
neoplastic stromal cells may be also targeted by this
therapeutic regimen, with the interesting consequence
to avoid the troublesome resistance to therapy, which is
typical of cancer cells.

(UltraVision, Bio-Optica, Milan, Italy), sections were
incubated overnight at 4°C with the β3-AR antibody
(1:100, Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy). Signal was
detected by using UltraVision Quanto Detection System
AP and the bound antibody was visualized using a
permanent Fast Red as chromogen (Thermo Scientific,
Milan, Italy). Nuclei were counterstained with Mayer’s
haematoxylin. Negative control was performed by
substituting the primary antibody with a non-immune
serum at the same concentration. Granular layer of the
epidermis, normal eccrine sweat glands and, at lesser
extent, sebaceous glands, expressed β3-AR. Eccrine
sweat gland staining was used as a positive internal
control (47).
Immunostaining was independently assessed
by two observers (D.M., S.M.). Discrepancies in the
reading were resolved by a second parallel reading of
the slides. The percentage of positive cells per lesion
was scored according to semi-quantitative criteria. Since
the percentage of positive nevus melanocytes/melanoma
cells was always higher than 50%, semi-quantitative
results were expressed as score 1 (50–80% positive
nevus melanocytes/melanoma cells), score 2 (81–90%
nevus melanocytes/melanoma cell staining), and score 3
(91–100% melanoma cell staining). The cell staining
intensity was scored on a scale as weak, moderate,
strong, very strong.
For statistical analysis, non-parametric tests
were used to determine significant differences between
groups. The percentage of positive cells per lesion after
immunological staining in each group was the unit of
analysis. Groups were: nevi, primary melanoma, MM.
Statistical evaluation was performed comparing nevi
versus malignant lesions, ISM + SSM versus NM+MM,
CN versus AN. Differences were assessed using the Fisher
test and were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Unless specified, all reagents were obtained from
Sigma; all cytokines used were from Peprotech.

Immunohistochemistry
Forty melanocytic lesions from 40 patients were
evaluated. Tissue samples were retrieved from the archives
of the Divisions of Pathology of Pistoia Hospital, Pistoia,
and of Pathological Anatomy, Department of Surgery
and Translational Medicine, University of Florence. One
sample from each case was analysed. The protocol has
been approved by the Institutional Review Board for the
use of human tissues. The study series included 5 common
melanocytic nevi (CN); 5 atypical melanocytic nevi
(AN); 5 in situ primary melanoma (ISM); 9 superficial
spreading melanoma (SSM) (thickness 0.30-1.90 mm,
mean 0.82 mm; 5 level II, 3 level III); 6 nodular melanoma
(NM) (thickness 1.40-17 mm, mean 5.2 mm; 2 level III,
3 level IV, 1 level V), 10 metastatic melanoma (MM), 5
cutaneous and 5 lymph-nodal.
Sections of 4 μm thickness were cut from tissue
blocks of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples.
Immuno-staining was performed according to standard
procedures. Briefly, antigen retrieval was performed
by immersing the slides in a thermostat bath containing
Epitope Retrieval Solution EDTA (pH 8.0) (Bio-Optica,
Italy) for 20 min at 97°C followed by cooling for 20 min
at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide in distilled water
for 10 min. After blocking with normal horse serum

Cell cultures and transfections
A375 human melanoma cells were from ATCC.
Cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS and
10  U/ml penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin. MSCs
were isolated from bone marrow aspirated of three
different human volunteers, following donor consent.
Cells were grown in in T75 cm2 with low glucose DMEM
(1 mM glucose). Experiments under hypoxic conditions
(1% O2) were performed in the hypoxic incubator. Human
monocytes were obtained from normal donor buffy coat
by gradient centrifugation using Ficoll and macrophages
were polarized as described by Comito and colleagues
[37]. For transient transfections, A375 cells were
plated in 60-mm cell culture dishes and grown to 80%
confluence. The siRNA (Life Technologies) was diluted
to a final concentration of 20nM. Transfections were
performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), following
manufacturer’s recommendations.

Isolation of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs)
and melanoma associated fibroblasts (MAFs)

separated and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Millipore).
The immunoblots were incubated in 3% bovine serum
albumin, 10 mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L EDTA,
and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, probed
first with specific antibodies and then with appropriate
secondary antibodies.

HDFs were isolated from healthy leg regions of
volunteers. MAFs were isolated from patients diagnosed
with primary melanoma placed in the back dorsal zone.
A small piece of the tumor tissue was minced into <1
mm pieces in size and digested overnight in 1 mg/mL
collagenase I at 37°C. They were then spun down,
re-suspended and plated into complete medium. We also
excluded contamination by skin stem cells of HDFs, by
evaluation of CD34 and cytokeratin-15, established skin
stem cell markers [53].

In vitro boyden invasion assay
Transwells (Costar), equipped with 8-μm-pore
polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters, were
coated with 50 μg/cm2 of reconstituted Matrigel (BD).
Cells were loaded into the upper compartment (5 × 104
cells in 200 μl) in serum-free growth medium. Cells were
allowed to migrate towards complete growth medium
or medium conditioned by stromal cells. After 24 h of
incubation at 37°C, non-invading cells were removed
mechanically using cotton swabs, and the membrane was
stained with Diff-Quick solution and chemoattracted cells
were counted.

Endothelial cells isolation and characterization
Human umbilical cord blood from healthy newborns
with a number of total nucleated cells <1.5 × 109 was
chosen in accomplishment with rules of Umbilical Cord
Bank of Careggi Hospital (Florence, Italy), with maternal
informed consent, in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and in compliance with Italian law. Endothelial
precursors cells (EPCs) have been isolated from Umbilical
Cord Bank as reported in Margheri et al [54]. Briefly,
blood was diluted 1:1 with Hanks balanced salt solution
and was overlaid on an appropriate volume of density
gradient separation medium. Cells were centrifuged for
30 minutes at room temperature at 740g. Mononuclear
cells were recovered, washed 3 times with Hanks balanced
salt solution and resuspended in complete EGM-2
medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 ng/mL VEGF,
and 5 IU/mL heparin. Cells were seeded on gelatin-coated
6-well tissue culture plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/
cm2 in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37°C. On days
4 and 7, half of the medium was exchanged with fresh
medium. Then the medium was changed completely with
EGM2–10% FBS every 3 days. EPC colonies appeared
in cell cultures after 2–3 weeks and were identified as
circumvented monolayers of cobblestone-like cells. EPCs
were analyzed for the expression of surface antigens
by flow cytometry (CD45, CD34, CD31, CD105/R,
VEGF-R2).

Capillary morphogenesis assay
All the experiments were performed using growth
factor–reduced Matrigel at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.
Fifty microliters of Matrigel was added to each well of a
96-well plate and then placed in a humidified incubator
at 37°C for 30 min. HUVECs and EPCs (2 × 104 cells/
well) were added to the Matrigel-coated plates in a final
volume of 200 μL. The effects on the morphogenesis of
endothelial cells were recorded after 6 h with an inverted
microscope (Leitz DM-IRB) equipped with CCD optics
and a digital analysis system. Results were quantified by
measuring the joint numbers in the field.

Real time PCR
Total RNA from cells was isolated using RNeasy
plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). 1 μg of total RNA was used
for Reverse transcription using QuantiTect reverse
transcription Kit (Qiagen). Measurement of gene
expression was performed by quantitative real-time PCR
(7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems)
using Quantifast SYBR Green PCR (Qiagen). The
amount of target is normalized to an endogenous
reference (GAPDH). The primers for VEGF-A were:
5′TTCTGCTGTCTTGGGTGCAT-3′
(forward),
5′TGTCCACCAGGGTCTCGATT-3′ (backward). The
primers for IL-8 were 5′-CTGGCCGTGGCTCTCTTG-3′
(forward),
5′-TTAGCACTCCTTGGCAAAACTG-3′
(backward).
The
primers
for
IL-6
were
5′AGTTCCTGCAGTCCAGCCTGAG-3′
(forward),
5′TCAAACTGCATAGCCACTTTCC-3′
(backward)
bFGF,
5′-GGCGTGTACATGTGGTCTCAGA-3′
(forward) and 5′-TTATGGCTCAC TGCAACCTTGA-3′
(backward).

Preparation of conditioned media
Conditioned media (CM) were obtained from HDFs,
MAFs, MSCs or macrophages. Cells were grown to subconfluence, then serum starved and incubated for 48 h
before collection of the CM. CM were harvested, clarified
by centrifugation, and used freshly.

Western blot analysis
Cells derived from our experimental conditions
were lysed for 20 min on ice in 500 μl of RIPA lysis
buffer. 20 μg of total proteins were loaded on SDS–PAGE,

A375 cells incubated for 72 h with CM were
detached using Accutase (Sigma). For melanospheres
formation, single cells were plated at 150 cells/cm2 on
low attachment 100 mm plate (Corning) in DMEM/F12
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with
N2 (Invitrogen), 20 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml bFGF and
10 ng/ml EGF. Cells were grown under these conditions
for 15–20 days and formed non-adherent P0 spheres. For
the evaluation of self-renewal a single melanosphere was
dissociated in single cells with Accutase and a dilution of
one cell per well into 96-well low attachment plates was
performed in order to isolate individual P1 melanospheres.
