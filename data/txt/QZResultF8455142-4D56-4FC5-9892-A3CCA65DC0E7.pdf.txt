ABSTRACT:
Even with successful surgical resection and perioperative chemotherapy and
radiation, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a high incidence of recurrence.
Tumor cell survival depends on activation of signaling pathways that suppress the
apoptotic stimuli of invasion and metastasis. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a critical
signaling molecule that has been implicated in tumor cell survival, invasion and
metastasis. We have previously shown that FAK and vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) are overexpressed in cancer cells and physically interact
to confer a significant survival advantage. We subsequently identified a novel small
molecule inhibitor C4 that targeted the VEGFR-3-FAK site of interaction. In this
study, we have shown that C4 disrupted the FAK-VEGFR-3 complexes in PDA cells. C4
treatment caused dose-dependent dephosphorylation and inactivation of the VEGFR-3
and FAK, reduction in cell viability and proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
PDA cells. C4 increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to gemcitabine chemotherapy in
vitro that lead to apoptosis at nanomolar concentrations of both drugs. C4 reduced
tumor growth in vivo in subcutaneous and orthotopic murine models of PDA. The drug
alone at low dose, decreased tumor growth; however, concomitant administration
with low dose of gemcitabine had significant synergistic effect and led to 70%
tumor reduction. Combination of C4 with gemcitabine had a prolonged cytostatic
effect on tumor growth after treatment withdrawal. Finally, we report an anecdotal
case of stage IV pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine in combination with C4
that showed a significant clinical response in primary tumor and complete clinical
response in liver metastasis over an eight month period. Taken together, these results
demonstrate that targeting the scaffolding function of FAK with a small-molecule FAKVEGFR-3 inhibitor can be an effective therapeutic strategy against PDA.

INTRODUCTION

presence of advanced disease at the time of diagnosis
and high resistance to treatments, due to activation of
redundant survival pathways in the tumor and stromal
cells [1-3]. The therapeutic standard for metastatic disease
has long been single-agent gemcitabine (GEM), which
can improve quality of life in a subset of patients and

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is
associated with a dismal prognosis with a 5 year survival
of less than 5%. Chemotherapy and radiation treatment

moderately extend survival. Several studies investigating
the role of conventional chemotherapy or targeted drugs
in conjunction with GEM have been mostly unsuccessful
[4]. The introduction of albumin-bound paclitaxel (nabpaclitaxel) affecting the desmoplastic stroma of PDA
[3, 5] substantially improved median survival (6.8 vs.
12.2 months) [6]. Clearly, additional agents that address
specific features of PDA are needed to improve outcomes
in this aggressive disease. Many of the survival signals
in PDA involve Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) [7, 8].
FAK, a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, localizes
at focal adhesions and is a major regulator of the signals
from ECM. It is one of the central molecules involved
in regulation of cancer cell metastasis and survival and
is associated with aggressive tumor behavior [9-11]. It
was shown that in PDA there is a statistically significant
correlation between FAK expression and tumor size, and
FAK expression and tumor staging [12, 13]. Experimental
data suggest that the aggressive capability of PDA is
related to activation of FAK with subsequent activation
of the Ras/Erk signaling pathway [7]. Indeed, FAK gene
silencing suppressed anoikis resistance in PDA cells
[14] and FAK siRNA potentiated gemcitabine-induced
cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo [15]. FAK has also been
implicated in chemoresistance – FAK phosphorylation
contributed to increased intrinsic chemoresistance to GEM
in PDA cell lines [16]. These factors make it an important
target in pancreatic cancer therapy. A few FAK kinase
inhibitors were described [17] and it was shown that small
molecule PF0562-271 reduced PDA tumor growth in
orthotopic mouse model [18].
One of the most significant functions of FAK
is its role as a scaffold for many growth-promoting
proteins. FAK is involved in multiple protein-protein
interactions and the scaffolding function of FAK plays
a pivotal role in cancer cell signaling [19, 20]. Targeting
cancer survival pathways with the drugs targeted to the
scaffold is emerging as a promising novel approach [21].
Data on targeting specific protein-protein interactions
of FAK demonstrate encouraging results in multiple
cancer models, including PDA [22, 23]. One of the
important components of the FAK scaffold is vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3 or Flt4).
Previously, we have shown that FAK physically interacts
with VEGFR-3 and provides important survival signals
for breast cancer cells [24]. VEGFR-3 belongs to the
VEGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases and plays an
important role in tumor vasculogenesis and angiogenesis
[25-27]. Recent data demonstrate that lymphangiogenesis,
facilitated by VEGFR-3 signaling, contributes to cancer
dissemination [28, 29] and in PDA expression of
VEGFR-3 ligands VEGF-C and VEGF-D has been
shown to correlate with the rate of metastasis to lymph
nodes [30, 31]. The VEGF-C, D/VEGFR-3 axis plays an
important role in cancer cell proliferation, survival and
resistance to chemotherapy [32-34]. We have shown that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

overexpression of VEGFR-3 increased aggressiveness
of the cancer cells [35]. Increased VEGFR-3 level in
pancreatic cancer tissues is related to marked expression
in the cancer stroma and to moderate immunoreactivity
in many cancer cells [30-32, 36]. Therefore VEGFR-3
upregulation on tumor blood vessels indicates a potential
additional antiangiogenic effect for VEGFR-3 inhibitors
[27, 36]. Indeed, inactivation of VEGFR-3 signaling
by blocking antibodies, suppresses tumor growth by
inhibiting tumor-induced neo-angiogenesis [25] and
leads to both regression of the lymphatic network and to
suppression of tumor lymph node metastasis [37, 38].
We have recently identified a novel molecular
inhibitor C4 (chloropyramine hydrochloride), that targets
the VEGFR-3-FAK site of interaction and disrupts the
survival function of these two proteins [39]. C4 showed
a marked reduction of breast tumor growth and was
synergistic with doxorubicin chemotherapy in breast
cancer xenograft models [39]. In this study we evaluated
the effect of C4 on pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and
pancreatic tumor growth in vivo in murine models of PDA
and have shown its synergy with GEM in inhibition of
pancreatic tumor growth. We report here an anecdotal case
with stage IV pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine
in combination with C4 that showed a significant clinical
response in primary tumor and complete clinical response
in liver metastasis over an eight month period.

RESULTS
C4 decreased the viability of pancreatic cancer
cells, reduced phosphorylation of FAK and
VEGFR-3 and decreased their complex formation.
To determine the effects of C4 on pancreatic cancer
cells, we first analyzed expression of FAK and VEGFR-3
in a panel of pancreatic cell lines and selected Panc-1 and
MiaPaCa-2 for further analysis, based on the expression
of both FAK and VEGFR-3 in these cells. Cells were
treated with increasing concentrations of C4 and viability
was measured after 24 and 48 h of treatment. Viability
experiments showed that both cell lines were sensitive to
C4 treatment and the effect was time- and dose-dependent
(Figure 1A, B). MiaPaCa-2 cells were more sensitive
to treatment with C4 than Panc-1 cells with up to 70%
reduction of viability after 48 h of treatment (Figure 1A,
B).
Next we tested the phosphorylation status of
FAK and VEGFR-3 after treatment with C4. Previously
we have shown that C4 decreased both FAK and
VEGFR-3 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells and
inhibited complex formation. Therefore, the effects
of C4 on phosphorylation were analyzed in FAK and
VEGFR-3 immunoprecipitates of MiaPaCa-2 and

Panc-1 cells after treatment for 24 h with increasing
concentrations of C4. In MiaPaCa-2 cells, C4 treatment
led to partial dephosphorylation of FAK on its major
autophosphorylation site Y397, as well as additional
FAK phosphorylation sites, that were revealed with antiphospho-tyrosin antibody (Figure 1C). This decrease of
the phosphorylated form of FAK occurred even in the
presence of stimulating ligand VEGF-C. The VEGFR-3FAK complex was significantly decreased in MiaPaca-2
cells after 24 h of treatment with 10 µM C4 (Figure 1C)

suggesting that C4 disrupted the FAK-VEGFR-3 complex.
Importantly, phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in MiaPaCa-2
cells was also abolished even in the VEGF-C stimulated
cells. This dephosphorylation affected the Tyr 1068 and
Tyr1230/1231 sites in the VEGFR-3 kinase domain
(Figure 1D). To assess changes in phosphorylation of
FAK in Panc-1 cells FAK was immunoprecipitated from
the lysates of cells treated with increasing concentration
of compound C4. We analyzed precipitates with antiphospho-tyrosine antibody, and found that 10 µM C4

the 100% viability of the untreated cells. C. C4 dose-dependent dephosphorylation of FAK and VEGFR-3 is accompanied by decrease
of FAK-VEGFR-3 association in PDA cells. Cells were treated with 10 µM (MiaPaCa-2) or 10 µM and 50 µM (Panc-1) of C4 for 24 h
and phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 and FAK was analyzed by immunoprecipitation (IP) with consequent western blotting (WB) with panphospho-tyrosine antibody 4G10, P-VEGFR-3 (Tyr 1230/1231) specific antibody and antibody to major autophosphorylation site of FAK
Y397. Control IP was done with isotype of the primary antibody. FAK precipitates were analyzed for the presence of VEGFR-3 protein
with VEGFR-3 specific antibody. Densitometry was performed for each IP experiment and data are presented as graphs on the right panel
of each figure.

treatment caused a decrease in total FAK phosphorylation,
and 50 µM treatment considerably reduced the amount
of active FAK (Figure 1E). We probed these precipitates
for the presence of the VEGFR-3 protein and found
that treatment with 10 µM C4 decreased the amount of
VEGFR-3 co-precipitated with FAK and 50 µM C4
significantly abrogated complex formation. This finding
correlated with the lower sensitivity of Panc-1 cells to C4
in the viability assay.
We have shown by kinase assays that
dephosphorylation of FAK and VEGFR-3 after treatment
with C4 was not related to C4 inhibition of their kinase
activity or kinase activity of some other closely related
kinases (Supplementary figure S1). Deactivation of FAK
and VEGFR-3 should be associated with C4 inhibition

of the FAK-VEGFR-3 binding site. We confirmed direct
binding of small molecule C4 with the FAT domain of
FAK in a direct binding assay Bio-Layer Interferometry
(Supplementary figure S2). Thus compound C4 reduced
the viability and specifically affected phosphorylation
of FAK and VEGFR-3 and their complex formation in
pancreatic cancer cells.

C4 treatment caused G1 arrest, lead to apoptosis
and affected Erk signaling pathway.
Next we measured the cell cycle status of
MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells after 24 h in the presence of
increased concentrations of C4 (Figure 2A). Cell cycle

distribution analysis showed that C4 delayed the cell cycle
progression by arresting the cells in G1-phase in both cell
lines. In MiaPaCa-2 cells, there was an increase in the
percentage of cells in G1-phase from 27±1.1% (vehicle
treated cells) to 61±2.1% (10 µM), with concomitant
decrease in percentage of cells in S phase from vehicle
treated 51±2.1% to 19±2.7% (10 µM) and a slight change
in the percentage of cells in G2 phase. The Panc-1 cells
started accumulating in G1-phase from 28±1% (vehicle
treated) to 53±1.5% (10 µM), similar to MiaPaCa-2, with
concomitant decrease in percentage of cells in S phase
from vehicle treated 51±2.1% to 17±2.7% (10 µM) and a
slight change in the percentage of cells in G2 phase. This
accumulation of cells in G1 was seen even at a low C4
concentration of 100 nM in both cell lines.
Two major pathways involved in the G1-to-S

transition are the RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3-AKT pathways
and it is known that FAK and VEGFR-3 are involved in
the activation of these pathways. Hence, we determined
the effect of C4 on Akt and Erk activation. We found
that C4 did not affect Akt phosphorylation at a 24 h time
point, with selected concentrations (data not shown). At
the same time C4 had a dose-dependent effect on Erk
dephosphorylation in MiaPaCa-2 cells (Figure 2B, left
panels) with significant inhibition of Erk1/2 at higher
concentration. In drug resistant Panc-1 cells we compared
the effect of C4 with FAK kinase inhibitor PF-562271
(PF271) and found that 24 h 10 µM treatment with C4
also led to dephosphorylation/deactivation of Erk1/2. At
the same time 10 µM PF271 caused activation of Erk1/2
(Figure 2B, right panels) with Erk phosphorylation
increased 1.5 times.

We next investigated whether the C4-mediated
decrease in viability of MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells
was due to apoptosis, because decrease in FAK
phosphorylation in cancer cells usually coincides with
cell death [40, 41]. We found that exposure for 24 h to 10
µM C4 induced apoptosis in MiaPaCa-2 to higher extend
than in Panc-1 cells (Figure 2D) and that corresponds to
higher C4 resistance of Panc-1 found in viability test. We
concluded that C4 caused PDA cell death through G1 cycle
arrest and through decrease the survival ability of the cells
by dephosphorylation/deactivation of Erk1/2.

(GEM) treatment in PDA cells and analyzed the effect
at reduced doses of both drugs. In MiaPaCa-2 cells,
viability was not affected by C4 or GEM at low doses
of 10 nM or 1 nM (Figure 3A). However, when 10 nM
doses of both C4 and GEM were combined there was
a decrease in the cell viability by 40%. Furthermore,
combination of C4 with GEM caused dose-dependent
apoptosis and at nanomolar doses of both drugs this effect
was synergistic (Figure 3B). This finding was confirmed
biochemically with increasing PARP cleavage in case
of dual treatment (Figure 3C). Although the Panc-1
cells were more resistant to GEM treatment, there was a
similar decrease in viability of approximately 40% with a
combination of 10 nM of each drug (Figure 3D). TUNEL
analysis of Panc-1 cells confirmed that they were more
resistant to apoptosis caused by GEM and C4 and only a
small portion of the cells underwent apoptotic cell death
even at 10 µM of each drug. However, we also saw an
increase in the number of apoptotic cells after combined

C4 sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to cytotoxic
therapy in vitro at nanomolar concentrations.
Our fundamental hypothesis is that disrupting of the
FAK scaffold-dependent survival pathways will augment
tumor sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy. We tested this
hypothesis by combining C4 with standard gemcitabine

treatment and confirmed TUNEL data biochemically by
demonstration of PARP cleavage in Panc-1 cells (Figure
3F). Therefore, a statistically significant decrease in cell
viability in comparison with control and each drug alone
was found at doses of 10 nM for both C4 and GEM. These
results demonstrated that disruption of FAK-VEGFR-3
protein-protein interaction with small molecule C4 caused
apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells and synergized with
cytotoxic treatment, leading to increased apoptosis at
nanomolar concentrations of both drugs.

smaller than the tumor size in control group (Figure 4
A), with approximate tumor growth reduction of 43%
(P=0.006) (Figure 4A). These data have shown that small
molecule C4 was able to reduce tumor growth in vivo, as
a single agent. Nonetheless, we recognized that effects of
C4 on tumor growth were moderate and we anticipated
use of this inhibitor in combination with cytotoxic agents.
Indeed, concomitant administration of C4 (50 mg/kg
1xq) with GEM (40 mg/kg 1x4d) reduced tumor growth
more than 90 % (P=0.003) in a MiaPaCa-2 prevention
model (Figure 4B). This result prompted us to confirm
the chemotherapy sensitizing effect of C4 using low
concentrations of GEM and C4 in our next experiment.
When GEM dose was reduced 10 fold (4 mg/kg) its effect
on tumor growth as a single agent was decreased from
73% to 32% of tumor growth reduction (Figure 4C), and
reduced concentration of C4 (10 mg/kg), led to 30% of
tumor growth reduction. However, combination of C4
and GEM at these concentrations caused more than 70%
tumor growth reduction (P=0.007). We concluded that C4
increases the sensitivity of PDA cells to chemotherapy and
the therapeutic dose of the drug can be reduced.

C4 decreased tumor growth in vivo and sensitized
to conventional chemotherapy.
Next we examined the activity of C4 against PDA
using the MiaPaCa-2 xenograft model. Intraperitoneal
injections of C4 (50 mg/kg) were started either the next
day after the cells were injected (prevention model) or
when the tumors reached on average a size of 100 mm3
(intervention model). After 21 days of C4 treatment, the
tumor volume of established tumors was significantly

than tumors treated with combination of the drugs (Figure
4D). The size of the tumors in the group with combination
of C4 and GEM was approximately 30% of the size of
the tumors from groups with C4 and GEM alone and this
difference was statistically significant.
All tumors were analyzed by IHC with Ki67
antibody and staining confirmed decrease in proliferation
of tumor cells (Figure 5A). We also analyzed the tumors
for the expression of vessel marker CD31 and measured
vessel density, because both tyrosine kinases FAK and

VEGFR-3 are important for vasculogenesis and are
expressed on endothelial cells. We found that vessel
density was changed differently in tumor periphery and
inside the tumors. The peritumoral vessel density was
significantly increased (Figure 5B, compare a and c). At
the same time we saw a decrease in the intratumoral vessel
density after four weeks of treatment with C4 (Figure 5B,
compare b and d). And we found that this vessel density
reduction was mostly related to vessel size reduction and
normalization of vessel network.

to assess the effect of C4 on tumor growth at orthotopic

for 21 days; while tumor growth was monitored by
bioluminescence imaging (Figure 6A). Maximal reduction
in tumor burden was observed in the dual treatment group.
These tumors were smaller than tumors in control group,
though the difference did not reach statistical significance
(P=0.076) (Figure 6B). Nevertheless, phosphorylation of
FAK, Akt, Erk and FAK substrate Paxillin was reduced not
only in combination C4 plus GEM treatment group but in
C4 group too (Figure 6C).
Finally we examined the activity of C4 against
patient tumor-derived pancreatic xenografts. For this
study, after 42 days of growth, tumor bearing mice (n=8
per group) were treated with either PBS or C4 (50 mg/kg,
IP) for 21 days. Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging
was performed before and after treatment to monitor
primary tumor growth and presence of metastases. T2weighted MRI was performed to assess tumor volume in
animals at baseline and following three weeks of therapy
(Figure 6D). Primary tumor volumes of animals in both
groups were comparable at the time treatment was initiated
(PBS = 527 ± 129 mm3, C4 = 724 ± 148 mm3; p>0.05). A
significant increase (p = 0.004) in primary tumor volume
was observed in PBS-treated controls over the three week
period (2104 ± 378 mm3). In contrast, C4-treated animals
did not show any significant increase in tumor volume
on day 21, compared to baseline. Compared to >4-fold
increase in tumor growth seen in controls, C4-treated
animals showed a two-fold increase in tumor growth (p
= 0.03). At the end of the experiment, MRI revealed the
presence of liver and lung metastases in 2/8 mice (25%)
in the PBS treated group. No evidence of metastasis was
seen in C4 treated mice.

or in combination with gemcitabine-based standard
chemotherapy, are not very efficient. Therefore, targeting
relatively unexplored signaling pathways can increase our
understanding of the complex biology of pancreatic cancer
and provide new therapy. In this study we explored the
simultaneous targeting of pathways related to the FAK and
VEGFR-3 signaling in PDA. Using the FAK inhibitor C4
targeted to VEGFR-3 protein-protein binding site on the
FAK FAT domain, we examined the effect of C4 on PDA
cell biology in vitro and therapeutic efficacy in vivo.
FAK plays a significant role in the regulation
of adhesion turnover and migration and is critical for
the survival and growth of the cancer cell [43, 44].
Consistent with this, we have shown that the treatment
with C4 of MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1cells inhibited PDA
cell viability, proliferation and migration. Importantly, we
confirmed direct binding of C4 (chloropyramine) to the
FAT domain of FAK with Octet biolayer interferometry
and confirmed high specificity of C4 actions. C4 affects
FAK-VEGFR-3 complex formation and phosphorylation
of these proteins but does not affect phosphorylation or
kinase activity of closely related proteins. Analysis of
phosphorylation status of FAK and VEGFR-3 revealed
a decrease in total phosphorylation and in case of
VEGFR-3 - dephosphorylation on Tyr-1230 and Tyr-1231.
Phosphorylation of these sites is important for interaction
with Grb2 and subsequent activation of the Akt1 and
Erk1/2 signaling. Tyr-1230/1231 contributes, together
with Tyr1337, to proliferation, migration, and survival of
endothelial cells [45] . We found that phosphorylation of
Grb2 dramatically reduced in PDA cells treated with C4
(not shown) and activation of Akt and Erk is inhibited.
We have shown that C4 treatment caused
apoptosis of PDA cells through G1 cycle arrest and
through the decrease the survival ability of the cells
by dephosphorylation/deactivation of Erk. This
finding correlates well with published literature on the
involvement of FAK in cell cycle regulation via activation
of protein kinase C isoforms and cyclins [46].
Our in vitro analysis demonstrated significant
effect of C4 on proliferation and death of PDA cells
as a single agent. Furthermore, its combination with
GEM demonstrated synergistic effect on cell viability
and induction of apoptosis even at low nanomolar
concentrations of both drugs, ineffective alone. This effect
was confirmed in our mouse model, where C4 or GEM
alone reduced tumor growth to a significantly low extent
than a combination of these two drugs. In accordance with
in vitro data, ten times lower concentration of gemcitabine
(4 mg/kg) in combination with six times lower
concentration of C4 (10 mg/kg) reduced tumor growth
almost as efficiently as combination of high concentrations
(TR=74% vs. TR=92%). Surprisingly, our results differ
from the preclinical study of FAK kinase inhibitor PF562,271, where combination with GEM did not increase
tumor growth inhibition [18]. Our comparison of schedule

Potential for clinical application.
Compound C4 is a small molecule chloropyramine
hydrochloride known as a competitive reversible H1receptor antagonist, widely used in Eastern Europe and
available over the counter. Figure 7A shows CT scan
image of a patient with stage IV pancreatic cancer who
personally elected to take daily oral chloropyramine
hydrochloride, in parallel with the standard course of
gemcitabine chemotherapy. Figure 7B shows significant
clinical response of primary tumor over an eight month
period of dual treatment. Importantly, liver metastasis seen
on initial CT and PET scan, has shown a complete clinical
response over an eight month period (Figure 7C).

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is known as
aggressive disease [42] with poor prognosis. Clinical
development of targeted agents directed against the
well-defined EGF/EGF receptor axis, the mutant KRAS
protein, MMPs, and VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, alone

and doses revealed very similar treatment approach (60
mg/kg IP once a day for C4 vs. 33 mg/kg twice a day
for Pfizer inhibitor PF-562271). We hypothesized that
FAK inhibitors decrease pro-survival function of FAK
and make cancer cells more vulnerable to additional
stress, but this discrepancy in data suggests that inhibition
of kinase function of FAK with kinase inhibitor affects
different mechanisms/pathways in cancer cell than PPI
inhibitor. In addition, we have shown an anecdotal report
of a patient with stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma who
had a clinical complete response to C4/gemcitabine based
therapy.
Targeting the site of protein-protein interaction
represents a novel approach to FAK inhibition with direct
disruption of downstream signaling. Protein-protein
interactions are now becoming increasingly attractive
targets for cancer therapeutics [47, 48]. Within the last few
years, sufficiently effective small-molecule inhibitors have
been identified for a few important PPIs [21]. In addition
to well-known nutlins, new inhibitors are entering clinical
studies and more are at preclinical stage. Thus, allosteric
FAK inhibitor Y15, targeting major autophosphorylation
site of FAK Y397, which affects not only FAK kinase
activity but, more importantly, FAK interactions with
Src and PI3K, showed promising results in treatment of
breast, pancreatic, colon and glioblastoma cancers [49].
PPI inhibitor NT2-31 targeted to the FAK-IGF-1R site of
interaction dramatically reduced growth of melanoma,
pancreatic and gastric cancers and show synergy with
chemotherapy [22, 50].
Our data demonstrate that FAK and VEGFR-3
proteins and their complexes are a great target because
they are present in tumor and stroma and their inhibition
will affect signaling in tumor and its microenvironment.
These results demonstrated that targeting the scaffolding
function of FAK with the small-molecule inhibitors can
be effectively used to develop potential oral-based cancer
therapeutics.

Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA): Procaspase-8, Erk 1/2, p-Erk, Akt, p-Akt, PARP. FAK mouse
monoclonal antibody (clone 4.47),  Paxillin, phosphotyrosin 4G10, VEGFR-3 clone 9D9 (Millipore, Billerica,
MA). Compound C4 - Chloropyramine hydrochloride,
Sigma #1915. FAK kinase inhibitor PF-562271 (Santa
Cruz, CA, USA).

Assays of cell viability
Cell survival was assayed by measuring
mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity with CellTiter 96®
Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Detection of apoptosis was performed by TUNEL
assay APO-DIRECT kit (Millipore) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Quantitative analysis
of apoptosis was performed using FlowJo program (Tree
Star, Ashland, OR).

Cell Cycle Analysis
For cell-cycle analysis, pancreatic cells were grown
to 70% confluency in 100-mm plates and then serum
starved for 48 hours to allow for synchronization. After
48 hours, medium was aspirated and fresh medium with
C4 or vehicle was added for 24 hours. Treated medium
was then collected, monolayers were washed with
cold PBS, cells were trypsinized, and cell pellets were
collected. Cell pellets were washed twice with PBS, fixed
in cold methanol, and rewashed with PBS to remove
methanol. After resuspension in 300–500 µL PBS, cells
were digested with 20 µg/ml RNase and cellular DNA
was stained with propidium iodide (50 µg/ml) by 3-hour
incubation at room temperature in the dark. The DNA
content of labeled cells was acquired using FACSCaliber
cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA) and FlowJo
software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western Blot Analysis

Cell lines
MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville,
MD, USA). Cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 with
10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were incubated at
37oC in 5% CO2.

Appropriately treated or non-treated cells were
allowed to grow until they are 80-85% confluent or until
treatment was completed. Cells were twice washed with
ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then incubated
on ice for 30 minutes with 1% NP-40 lysis buffer, with
inhibitors as previously published [39].

each group. Treatment with compound C4 was started
the next day, after cells injection or when tumor reached
approximately 100 mm3. Tumor size was measured twice
weekly and volume was calculated using the formula
length X width2 X 0.5. Animals were sacrificed after 21
days of treatment or when tumor size reached protocol
end point. Tumor was excised, measured and preserved
for protein and RNA preparation and cytochemistry.

All staining procedures were done as previously
described [50]. For detection, we used Vectastain Elite
ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Diaminobenzidine
(DAB) was used as the chromogen, and the slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin. A negative and positive
control was included in each staining. IHC-stained
tissue slides were scanned in an Aperio ScanScope CS,
viewed using ImageScope software, and quantified using
Aperio Image Analysis algorithms (Aperio Technologies,
Inc., Vista, CA). A full time research pathologist (W.B.)
analyzed tissue section for Ki67 and CD31 expression.
To obtain relative staining levels, five fields/samples
containing a minimum of 100 cells each were analyzed
for each stain. Staining analysis for Ki67 expression was
done using nuclear algorithm (V9) that measured intensity
(0, none; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong) and percentage
of positive cells (0–100). Staining analysis for CD31
expression was done using the microvessel algorithms (v9)
which reported scores for vessel density, mean for vessel
lumen, mean for vessel size, average vessel thickness.
Both algorithms were modified to and parameters were
adjusted to enhance the performance and accuracy of the
analysis. The results of the analysis were exported as CSV
file format.

Surgical orthotopic implantation:
Mice were anesthetized and the abdomen was
cleaned with isopropyl alcohol, and a left upper transverse
incision was made to and including the peritoneum. The
pancreas was exposed, and 1 × 106 cells MiaPaCa-2 or
cells derived from patient’s tumor 11424, previously
characterized in Dr. Repasky lab, were suspended in 50 μL
of PBS: Matrigel were slowly injected into the body of the
pancreas. Mice were allocated to 1 of 4 groups (n = 6 mice
per group). The pancreas was returned, and the abdomen
was closed with 5-0 Vicryl (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). The
mice were observed for 6-10 weeks and Necropsy was
performed. Animals were housed in facilities approved by
the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care and in accordance with current regulations
and standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Magnetic resonance imaging

Statistical analysis

MRI studies were conducted using a 4.7-T/33-cm
horizontal bore magnet (GE NMR Instruments, Fremont,
CA) incorporating AVANCE digital electronics (Bruker
Medical Inc., Billerica, MA) generating maximum field
strength of 950 mT/m and a custom-designed 35-mm
RF transmit-receive coil. Induction of anesthesia before
imaging and maintenance of anesthesia during imaging
was achieved by inhalation of isoflurane (∼2–3% in
oxygen). Anesthetized animals were placed on an acrylic
sled equipped with respiratory and temperature sensors
and positioned within the magnet. An air heater system
was used to maintain animal temperature in conjunction
with the sensors embedded within the sled, which provided
continuous feedback during imaging. Preliminary scout
images were acquired on the sagittal and axial planes
to assist in slice prescription for subsequent scans. T2weighted images were acquired on the coronal plane with
the following parameters: TE/TR = 41/2,500 ms, matrix
size 256 × 192, 1 mm thick slices, FOV 3.2 × 3.2 cm,
NEX = 4. Image processing and analysis were carried
out using commercially available software (AnalyzePC;
AnalyzeDirect). ). A primary tumor volume (mm3) was
calculated from manually traced regions-of-interest (ROI)
on multislice T2-weighted images.

For all experiments comparison between groups
were made using a two-tailed two-sample Student’s t test.
Differences for which P value was less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
