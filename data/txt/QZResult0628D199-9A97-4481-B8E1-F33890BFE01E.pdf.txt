Effect of the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor
SNDX-275 on Fas Signaling in Osteosarcoma
Cells and the Feasibility of Its Topical
Application for the Treatment of
Osteosarcoma Lung Metastases
Nadezhda V. Koshkina, PhD1; Krithi Rao-Bindal, MS2; and Eugenie S. Kleinerman, MD2

BACKGROUND: Patients with lung metastases from osteosarcoma (OS) have poor response to salvage therapy.
Understanding the mechanisms involved in the metastatic process of OS may lead to new effective therapeutic
approaches. The authors reported previously that up-regulation of the Fas receptor by transfecting OS cells with Fas
plasmid inhibited the in vivo growth of metastases in the lungs. METHODS: In the current study, the authors treated
OS cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor SNDX-275 and studied its cytotoxicity and its effect on Fas signaling
in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Subtoxic doses of SNDX-275 were able to activate the Fas pathway in OS cells by
increasing the expression of Fas messenger RNA; however, the increased expression was not always followed by
increased levels of Fas receptor expression on the cell surface. The treatment of cells with a combination of SNDX275 and Fas ligand (FasL) had a stronger cytotoxic effect on tested OS cells than either agent alone. Inhibition of the
Fas pathway in cells by inhibition of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) molecule eliminated this combination
effect, indicating that activity of FADD is important for the efficacy of this agent in the FasL-expressing environment
of the lungs. Intranasal administration of SNDX-275 in mice with OS lung metastases revealed that SNDX-275 may inhibit metastatic growth at a dose of 0.13 mg/kg, which is approximately 200-fold lower than the therapeutically
effective oral dose reported previously. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings indicated that SNDX-275 can activate
Fas signaling in OS cells in vitro and in vivo and that the administration of SDNX-275 by inhalation is feasible as a

The most common and almost exclusive site for osteosarcoma (OS) metastasis is the lungs. Metastatic OS is difficult to
treat. The overall survival rate for these patients ranges from 20% to 25%. Over the past 25 years, alterations in chemotherapy regimens have not improved survival rates significantly,1 indicating the need for new therapeutic approaches for
the treatment of lung metastases from OS.
The formation of metastases is a complicated process. Evaluation of the key mechanisms that control metastatic process should lead to the creation of novel therapeutic targets. We previously observed that the Fas pathway plays an important role in the growth of OS metastasis in the lungs. Lungs belong to the few organs in the body that constitutively
express Fas ligand (FasL). When tumor cells that express Fas receptor on their surface migrate to the lungs, their Fas binds
with FasL, which is expressed in the lung environment. This event leads to trimerization of the receptor and recruitment
of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) adaptor molecule. Assembly of these molecules all together is called the

‘‘death-inducing signaling complex’’ (DISC). The formation of DISC ultimately results in proteolytic cleavage of
caspases and apoptosis.2 By using LM7 and DLM8 models of OS lung metastases, we demonstrated that, because
of this mechanism, only Fas-negative cells were able to
survive and form lung metastases, whereas Fas-positive
OS cells were cleared rapidly from the lung.3 These findings were confirmed further by an analysis of Fas expression in OS lung metastases from patients. In most patient
samples, OS lung metastases had negligible levels of Fas.
The elevation of Fas expression was observed in patients
who had received chemotherapy before undergoing resection of their lung metastases.4 This finding indicates that
Fas expression may be triggered by treatment and that Fas
may contribute to the therapeutic effect. Indeed, we made
similar observations in LM7 and DLM8 animal models
with OS lung metastases that received aerosol chemotherapy.5,6 The inhibition of Fas-mediated signaling significantly corrupted tumor response to the treatment.6 These
results indicated that Fas signaling is a critical mechanism
in the treatment of OS lung metastases. Therefore, the
identification of agents that can enhance Fas receptor
expression in OS tumor cells and/or that can activate
downstream Fas signaling may lead to the discovery of a
novel therapeutic approach for patients with recurrent OS
in the lungs.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors comprise a
novel class of promising anticancer agents that have been
approved for clinical use. HDAC inhibitors promote acetylation of histones, which are required for the promotion
of gene transcription. Several classes of HDAC inhibitors
have been identified, but their effect on OS cells regarding
the Fas pathway is not well understood. The most detailed
studies were performed by Imai et al, who demonstrated
that the treatment of sarcoma cells with the FK901228
HDAC inhibitor was able to induce apoptosis in tumor
cells and up-regulate FasL expression. However, those
investigators did not observe changes in Fas receptor
expression.7
In the current study, we investigated the effect of
another HDAC inhibitor, SNDX-275, which specifically
inhibits class I HDACs,8 on Fas signaling in different OS
cells. We used low doses of SNDX-275 that, alone, had
little effect of the growth of OS cells in vitro. The objectives of this approach were to evaluate the ability of
SNDX-275 to sensitize tumor cells to apoptosis in a FasLexpressing environment without inducing a direct killing
effect by itself and to determine the mechanism of this
sensitization. We observed that, in 1 OS cell line

3458

(DLM8), SNDX-275 activated the Fas pathway by
directly up-regulating Fas messenger RNA (mRNA) and
its receptor expression on the cell surface; whereas, in the
other cell line (LM7), we did not observe elevated levels of
Fas receptor on the cell surface despite increased mRNA
levels. Treatment of both cell lines with a combination of
SNDX-275 and FasL produced an increased cytotoxic
effect compared with the effect of either agent alone. Corruption of the Fas pathway in both tumor cell lines by inhibiting the Fas adapter molecule FADD reversed the
killing effect of combined SNDX-275 and FasL, indicating on important role for this molecule in activation of
the Fas pathway by SNDX-275. On the basis of these
results, we concluded that SNDX-275 is able to activate
Fas signaling in OS cells and to induce their cell death in a
FasL-expressing environment without having a direct cytotoxic effect by itself.
To date, there have been few therapeutic studies of
SNDX-275 in solid tumors, including sarcomas.9-12
However, those studies were performed in subcutaneous
xenograft models, and high levels of FasL expression were
not reported in subcutaneous tissues. In addition, OS
metastasizes almost exclusively to the lungs. Therefore, in
the current study, we sought to verify the efficacy of
SNDX-275 treatment using a more relevant experimental
mouse model with established OS metastases in the
lungs.13,14 To minimize systemic exposure and deliver the
drug directly to the lungs, we used an aerosol delivery
approach. We previously demonstrated that aerosol
administration is feasible for delivering anticancer drugs
directly to the lungs,5,15,16 and we have developed unique
technology for outpatient aerosol anticancer therapy.17 In
this study, we treated mice intranasally with SNDX-275
at a dose that which was approximately 200-fold lower
than the previously reported, therapeutically effective oral
dose,9,10 and we demonstrated that this dose was able to
inhibit the growth of OS lung metastases in mice.

according to the manufacturer’s instructions (catalog no.
4322288; Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, Calif). The STR
profiles were compared with known American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) fingerprints (ATCC, Rockville,
Md; http://www.atcc.org December 28, 2009), with the
Cell Line Integrated Molecular Authentication (CLIMA)
database (version 0.1.200808; http://bioinformatics.istge.it/clima/ December 28, 2009)18 and with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center fingerprint
database. The STR profiles either matched known DNA
fingerprints or were unique. The authenticity of cells was
determined on November 12, 2010 by the Characterized
Cell Line Core at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center. All cell lines were maintained in complete
Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Whittaker Bioproducts Inc., Walkersville, Md) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NJ).
Recombinant, soluble super-FasL was purchased from
Alexis Biochemicals, Inc. (Farmingdale, NY). SNDX-275
was a kind gift from Syndax Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Waltham, Mass). Phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-Fas antibodies and isotype-matched controls were purchased
from BD Biosciences (San Diego, Calif). Antihuman
FADD monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate
Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY).
Flow Cytometry
To analyze OS cells for Fas, 1 million cells were suspended
in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer
(phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], 2% fetal calf serum,
and 0.1% sodium azide), and the cells were incubated
with either 1.0 mg/mL PE-conjugated mouse antihuman
Fas antibody (clone DX2) or hamster antimouse Fas
monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif) for
human and cells mouse cells, respectively. PE-conjugated,
isotype-matched control immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were used as negative controls. Samples were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, Mountain View, Calif). Experiments for all
cell lines were performed simultaneously.
Cytotoxicity Assay
The sensitivity of OS cells to soluble FasL (sFasL) (Alexis
Biochemicals, San Diego, Calif) was determined by 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described previously.3 Briefly, 3000

with SNDX-275 for the time specified in the text fol-

lowed by the addition of 10 ng/mL sFasL for 24 hours;
wells that were treated with a single agent or empty wells
served as controls. MTT reagent was added to each well at
a concentration of 0.08 mg/mL for 2 to 4 hours. Then,
the cells were lysed with 0.1 mL dimethyl sulfoxide. Cytotoxicity was quantified using a microtiter plate-reader at
570 nm. Experiments for all cell lines were performed
simultaneously.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay
Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde added
directly to cell culture medium for 10 minutes at room
temperature. The cell monolayers were washed twice with
ice-cold 1  PBS and collected in dithiothreitol solution
(100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.4; and 10 mM dithiothreitol)
followed by incubation at 30 C for 10 minutes. Cells
were washed sequentially with ice-cold PBS, Buffer I
(0.25 M Triton X-100; 1 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA], 0.5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid
[EGTA], and 10 mM 4-[2-hydroxyethyl]-1-piperazine
ethane sulfonic acid [HEPES], pH 6.5), and Buffer II
(200 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; and 10 mM HEPES, pH
6.5), which contained protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and then lysed in lysis buffer (1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate; 10 mM EDTA; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1; protease inhibitors; and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)
for 10 minutes on ice. Sonication was performed using a
Branson-450 Sonifier with Microtip (Branson, Danbury,
Conn) in 7-second bursts followed by 1 minute of cooling
on ice for a total sonication time of 21 second per sample.
This resulted in DNA fragment sizes from 0.7 kb to 1.5
kb. Then, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 revolutions per minute for 10 minutes at 4 C. Supernatants
were diluted 5-fold in chromatin immunoprecipitation
assay (ChIP) dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100; 2 mM
EDTA; 150 mM NaCl; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1; plus
protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and precleared for
30 minutes at 4 C with 20 lL preimmune serum and 80
lL salmon sperm DNA/protein A/G agarose slurry. Ten
percent of the total supernatant was saved as a total input
control and was processed with the eluted immunoprecipitates beginning with the cross-linking reversal step. Five
micrograms of ChIP-grade specific rabbit polyclonal antiacetyl H3 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, Mass) were
added to the chromatin solutions, and the samples were
incubated at 4 C overnight with rotation. Immunocomplexes were collected with 60 lL of the salmon sperm
DNA/protein A/G agarose beads for 1 hour at 4 C with
rotation. Beads were then washed consecutively for 10

minutes each with low-salt wash buffer (0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]; 1% Triton X-100; 2 mM EDTA;
150 mM NaCl; and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), high-salt
wash buffer (0.1% SDS; 1% Triton X-100; 2 mM
EDTA; 500 mM NaCl; and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1),
LiCl wash buffer (0.25 mM LiCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 1%
deoxycholate; 1 mM EDTA; and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.1), and twice in 1  Tris/EDTA (TE) buffer. A final
wash with TE buffer was divided in half, and the pellet
was frozen at  80 C until use. Half of the complex was
examined further for fas promoter polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, and the other half was examined for
the global chromatin acetylation status on histone H3 by
Western blot analysis.
For PCR analysis, reverse formaldehyde cross-link
was performed by eluting the pellet twice in 100 lL
freshly made elution buffer (1% SDS/0.1 M NaHCO3)
during 15 minutes. One microliter of 10 mg/mL RNase
and 5 M NaCl to a final concentration of 0.3 M was
added to the eluate, and the sample was incubated at
64 C overnight. DNA was recovered using the QiaQuick
spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) and was eluted in
80 lL of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0. Recovered DNA was then
quantified by PCR (see below).
For Western blot analysis, the chromatin-DNA
complex pellet was dissociated by adding 25 lL of 1 
Laemmli buffer and boiling for 10 minutes. The beads
were pelleted by centrifugation and discarded, and the
supernatants were loaded onto 15% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels. The proteins from the
gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and
stained with a ChIP-grade monoclonal mouse antiacetyl
K9 Histone 3 antibody from Abcam followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antimouse IgG antibody exposure.
Plasmids and the Establishment of Stable
FADD Dominant-Negative Clones
The plasmid constructs for human FADD dominant-negative (FDN) were a kind gift from Drs. Rokhlin and

3460

Taghiyev (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa),19 and the
mouse FDN constructs kindly were provided by Dr.
Winoto (University of California, Berkley, Calif).20 Both
cell lines were transfected with plasmids using the
Fugene6 reagent (Roche Applied Biosystems, Indianapolis, Ind).
Western Blot Assay
Cell lysates were processed by Western blot analysis as
described previously.3 Briefly, 0.02 mg of proteins were
separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences Inc., Pittsburg, Pa). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat
dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and then
incubated with an anti-FADD antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Reverse Transcriptase-PCR
Total RNA from cells was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Life Technologies, Inc, Gaitherburg, Md). Three micrograms of RNA were reverse-transcribed using a Reverse
Transcription System (Promega, Madison, Wis). The
2.5-lL aliquot of resulting combinational DNA was used
for PCR amplification with Taq-polymerase (Promega)
using specific primers for Fas and FADD (for primers and
annealing temperatures, see Table 1). Primers for b-actin
were used as loading controls. Cycling conditions were at
94 C for 60 seconds, annealing for 60 seconds, and
primer extension at 72 C for 30 seconds.
Animal Study
Nu/nu mice and C3H mice were purchased from the
National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, Md) and were
housed in standard cages with food and water provided ad
libitum. All animal experiments were performed with the
approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were injected with human LM7 cells
through the tail vein. Then, the mice were divided randomly into 2 groups (6 mice per group). Both groups
received treatment intranasally under isoflurane anesthesia. Inhalation-based treatment was initiated 32 days after

tumor cell inoculation, when micrometastases were established in lungs. Mice received either 0.13 mg/kg SNDX275 or PBS (as a control) 3 times weekly for 3 weeks.
Because mice are nose-obligatory breathers, substances
administered through the nose will go into the lungs. We
observed a slight toxicity in mice after 3 weeks, most likely
caused by frequent anesthesia, because the control mice
had signs of toxicity similar to those observed in the mice
that received SNDX-275 treatment; therefore, the frequency of treatment was decreased to twice weekly at the
same dose, and the treatment was continued for another 2
weeks. At the end of treatment, mice were killed, their
lungs were resected and weighed, and visible lung metastases were counted.
Immunohistochemistry
Lung tissues from mice were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were then deparafinized in
xylene and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed
by boiling slides with tissues in a microwave for 5 minutes
in 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. To block exogenous peroxidase, tissues were blocked with 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 12 minutes. Nonspecific binding was then
blocked with PBS containing 10% normal horse serum
and 1% normal goat serum (protein-blocking buffer).
The primary antibodies (polyclonal rabbit antihuman Fas
[C-20] or FADD [H-181] antibodies from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc [Santa Cruz, Calif]) at 1:50 dilution
in protein-blocking buffer were applied over the tissue
and left overnight at 4 C. The secondary goat-antirabbit
antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me) was then applied for 2 hours
at ambient temperature. Finally, the slides were developed
with 3,30-diaminobenzidine as a substrate and were
lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative controls were prepared by omitting the primary antibodies.
Liver tissue was used as a positive control for Fas, as
described previously,4 and for FADD, as verified by the
antibody provider. Tissues were examined under a conventional light microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany), and representative tumor lesions were photographed at 100 magnification.
Statistical Analysis
The unpaired Student t test was used to determine the significance of differences between experimental groups.
The Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was used to evaluate
data from the in vivo experiments. P values < .05 were
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
SNDX-275 Sensitizes DLM8 Mouse OS Cells to
FasL by Up-Regulating Fas Receptor
Expression
Mouse OS DLM8 cells were treated with a low dose of
SNDX-275 (3 lM) for 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours.
Flow cytometry analysis of Fas expression on the cell surface of DLM8 cells revealed that it increased over time
(Fig. 1A). Elevated Fas expression also was observed with
an increased dose of SNDX-275: in the untreated population, approximately 25% of DLM8 cells were Fas-positive, whereas the treatment of cells with 1 lM and 3 lM
SNDX-275 increased the percentages to 40% and 98% of
DLM8 cells, respectively. Cytotoxicity studies revealed
that this concentration of SNDX-275 was not toxic in
DLM8 cells (Fig. 1B).
To examine the biologic activity of overexpressed
Fas, we pretreated DLM8 cells with the same dose of
SNDX-275 for 48 hours and then added 10 ng/mL FasL
for another 24 hours. The cytotoxic effect was determined

FasL resulted in an increased cytotoxic effect compared
with that produced by either agent alone in DLM8 cells

SNDX-275 Promotes Fas Expression in DLM8
Cells by Increasing Histone Acetylation of the
Fas Gene Promoter and mRNA Expression
HDAC inhibitors activate transcription by histone acetylation. To verify that SNDX-275 enhances histone acetylation in DLM8 cells, we performed a ChIP assay. We
examined the acetylation status of global histone 3 and of
histone 3 on the fas promoter. The ChIP assay followed
by Western blot analysis of the protein lysate confirmed
that overall histone 3 acetylation of chromatin protein
was increased in DLM8 cells after treatment with SNDX275 (Fig. 2A).
A ChIP assay followed by PCR with specific primers
for fas promoter also was used to determine the level of fas
gene promoter acetylation after treatment with SNDX275 in these cells. Acetylation of the fas promoter did not
increase significantly at a low SNDX-275 concentration
(1 lM), as illustrated in Figure 2B, but increased after exposure to 3 lM SNDX-275. The subsequent reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis demonstrated the elevation
of mRNA expression in DLM8 cells after SNDX-275
treatment in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (Fig. 3).

Inactivation of the FADD Molecule in DLM8
Cells Reverses the Cytotoxic Effect of
Combined SNDX-275 and FasL
To verify the significance of Fas signaling in response to
the SNDX-275 treatment for DLM8 cells in an environment that constitutively expresses FasL, we inhibited the
pathway by stable transfection of cells with FDN plasmid
(Fig. 4A). This transformation completely reversed the
combination effect of SNDX-275 and FasL treatment
(Fig. 4B).

Real-time PCR analysis revealed that 2 lM SNDX-275
increased the expression of Fas mRNA in LM7 cells (Fig.

up-regulation of Fas receptor expression on the cell surface of LM7 cells after treatment with SNDX-275 alone
(Fig. 6A). The combined effect of SNDX-275 and FasL
observed in DLM8 cells also occurred in LM7 cells (P <
.001; Student t test) (Fig. 6B).
SNDX-275 Activates Fas Signaling in LM7
Cells Through FADD
To determine whether the combined effect of SNDX-275
and FasL in LM7 cells can be modulated by downstream
Fas signaling, we studied changes in mRNA expression
for the most upstream Fas adapter molecule: FADD. RTPCR and Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of
FADD in the cytoplasm of these cells (Figs. 7, 8).
To further verify the significance of FADD in the
activation of Fas signaling in LM7 cells in response to
SNDX-275 treatment, we transfected them with FDN

Vec cells, the combination of SNDX-275 and FasL produced a significantly increased cytotoxic effect compared
with either agent alone, whereas this effect of combined
treatment was inhibited in LM7/FDN cells (Fig. 9B).

was 56  43 in the control group and 18  2 in the
treated group (P ¼ .04; Mann-Whitney test). During immunohistochemical examination, we compared the lung
metastases of medium size, because larger tumors have a
higher background of apoptosis and necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining of the lungs did not reveal any significant difference in Fas expression in the LM7

FADD expression levels were higher in the metastases
from SNDX-275-treated mice than in those from control
mice (Fig. 10B). All metastatic lesions in mice from the
SNDX-275-treated group were positive for FADD. However, the staining pattern within tumors was not even—
some areas within the same tumors were positive for
FADD, and some were not. The intensity of staining also

the PBS-treated group were positive for FADD.

DISCUSSION
Currently, there is sufficient evidence indicating that
down-regulation of the Fas receptor may be associated
with a poor prognosis and metastasis formation in
patients with different types of cancer.21-23 In our previous studies of OS, we observed that levels of Fas expression in OS lung metastases from patients and animals
were increased after treatment.4-6 This indicates that the
fas gene is present in OS tumor cells, but its expression is
inhibited in OS metastatic lesions and may be reactivated
by chemotherapy. Therefore, detection of the mechanisms responsible for epigenetic silencing of the fas gene
and identification of agents that are capable of increasing
its expression in tumor cells will have important therapeutic significance.
Several mechanisms are responsible for the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Our studies of the fas
gene methylation status and the use of demethylation
agents revealed that methylation mechanisms cannot

change fas gene expression in OS cells.24 Another mechanism that plays a key role in the regulation of gene transcription is chromatin histone acetylation. Several studies
have demonstrated the ability of HDAC inhibitors to
stimulate fas gene transcription in different types of cancer
cells.25-27 However, little is known about the effect of
these inhibitors on the Fas pathway in OS. Imai and colleagues were the first to describe the ability of the panHDAC inhibitor FR901228 to induce OS tumor regression through Fas signaling by inducing the expression of
FasL in vitro.7 Later, Watanabe et al described the ability
of FR901228 to sensitize OS tumor cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis by the suppression of cellular
FADD-like interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme
(FLICE)-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) expression.28 In the
current study, we observed that transcription of the fas
gene can be stimulated in OS cells by treatment with the
HDAC inhibitor SNDX-275. Treatment of DLM8 cells,
which express low levels of Fas, with a subtoxic dose of
SNDX-275 enhanced the expression of Fas mRNA and
its protein on the tumor cell surface. This elevation of Fas
receptor expression increased the sensitivity of DLM8
cells to FasL treatment. ChIP analysis revealed an
increased acetylation status of the fas gene promoter in
these cells, indicating that chromatin histone acetylation
is the mechanism responsible for up-regulating fas gene
expression in these cells. Because SNDX-275 works by inhibiting Class I HDACs,8 inactivation of only these
HDACs was sufficient for the induction of Fas expression
in OS cells and increased their sensitivity to FasL
treatment.
It is noteworthy that, in LM7 cells, which also have
low levels of Fas receptor expression, treatment with
SNDX-275 was followed by elevated levels of Fas but not
by the elevation of Fas receptor expression on the cell surface. Although we observed that Fas receptor expression
on the tumor cell surface was not increased, the treatment
of LM7 cells with a combination of SNDX-275 and FasL
produced an increased cytotoxic effect compared with
treatment by either agent alone. We believe that the lack
of correlation between Fas mRNA and its protein expression on the cell surface may be caused by some post-translational dysregulation. Alterations of microRNA levels,
proteasome activity, or receptor trafficking (all of which
regulate different post-translation events) by HDAC
inhibitors29-34 may be responsible for this incongruity.
Although we observed that Fas receptor expression
on LM7 tumor cell surface was not increased, the treatment of LM7 cells with a combination of SNDX-275 and

Original Article

FasL produced an increased cytotoxic effect compared
with treatment by either agent alone. This indicates that,
in LM7 cells, levels of the Fas receptor molecule were sufficient to induce apoptosis, but there was a discrepancy in
the expression of some downstream signaling molecules.
RT-PCR analysis revealed that treatment of LM7 cells
with SNDX-275 increased the expression of FADD
mRNA, which is the most upstream adaptor molecule to
Fas receptor and is an essential component of DISC formation.2 Inhibition of FADD activity in these cells
reversed the cytotoxic effect of combined SNDX-275 plus
FasL. Similarly, the inhibition of FADD activity in DLM8
cells reversed the cytotoxic effect of this combination.
Taken together, our in vitro data indicate that
SNDX-275 can activate Fas signaling by stimulating transcription of the fas gene and increasing the expression of
Fas mRNA and protein. However, in some cells, elevation
of Fas mRNA was not followed by up-regulation of the
Fas receptor expression on the cell surface, and this did
not interfere with the cells’ increased sensitivity to combined SNDX-275 and FasL treatment. FADD mRNA
expression in these cells was elevated in response to
SNDX-275 treatment, and its inhibition reversed the cytotoxic effect of combined SMDX-275 and FasL. These
findings indicate an important role for FADD as a mediator of Fas signaling in OS cells in response to SNDX-275
treatment.
To further confirm the feasibility of SNDX-275 in
treatment of OS lung metastases, we treated mice with
established OS lung metastases with this drug. To minimize systemic exposure of SNDX-275 and to verify the
feasibility of a topical drug delivery approach to the lungs
through inhalation, mice received SNDX-275 intranasally. It is noteworthy that the intranasal dose we used in
our study (0.1 mg/kg) was significantly lower than the
oral dose (24.5 mg/kg) that reportedly had therapeutic
potential in studies of different types of subcutaneous tumor xenograft models.9,10 Intranasal administration of
SNDX-275 for 5 weeks was well tolerated and significantly inhibited LM7 OS metastasis growth in the lungs,
indicating local administration of the drug to the lungs by
inhalation facilitates the delivery of a therapeutic dose.
The discrepancy between the inhalation and systemic
therapeutic doses may be explained by the specificity of
FasL expression in the pulmonary environment and the
ability of SNDX-275 to activate Fas-induced apoptosis at
the subtoxic doses that we used in vitro. Indeed, immunohistochemical analysis of LM7 OS metastases obtained
from mice revealed that Fas expression did not change sig-

3466

nificantly after SNDX-275 treatment, but the levels of
FADD expression in these mice were higher than the levels in the control group. These in vivo findings correlate
with our in vitro data and indicate that activation of the
downstream FADD molecule in Fas signaling may be important for the therapeutic effect of this agent. We realize
that intranasal administration cannot be used in humans
and does not result in equal distribution of SNDX-275 in
the lungs or deep penetration of the agent into the respiratory zone, where lung metastases frequently form. In addition, low solubility of the drug in water prevented us from
using higher doses, which could provide a stronger antitumor effect. Therefore, in our future studies, we plan to develop a liposome aerosol formulation for this agent that
will allow us to bypass the limitations of intranasal administration and poor water solubility and will provide a topical, noninvasive method of drug delivery to the lungs. We
also plan to investigate whether this agent is capable of
inducing mechanisms other than Fas, because it is recognized that these agents can target multiple mechanisms in
cancer cells. The effect of this drug on normal lung tissues
also warrants further investigation.
In summary, we have established that the inhibition
of HDACs by SNDX-275 at subtoxic doses is sufficient
to activate the Fas pathway in OS cells and triggers apoptosis induction in the FasL-expressing environment.
Topical intranasal administration of SNDX-275 to the
lungs of mice with established OS pulmonary metastases
inhibited metastatic growth and was followed by changes
in FADD expression downstream of the Fas receptor,
indicating that the Fas pathway may play an important
role in the response to this treatment. Currently, SNDX275 is in clinical trials in adults, and our studies indicate
that its application as an aerosol therapy also should be
considered for the treatment of pediatric OS lung
metastases.
