ABSTRACT
Our previous studies revealed that tetraspanin CD151 plays multiple roles in the
progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by forming a functional complex with
integrin `6β1. Herein, we generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that dissociates
the CD151/integrin `6β1 complex, and we evaluated its bioactivity in HCCs. A murine
mAb, tetraspanin CD151 (IgG1, called CD151 mAb 9B), was successfully generated
against the CD151-integrin `6β1 binding site of CD151 extracellular domains. Coimmunoprecipitation using CD151 mAb 9B followed by Western blotting detected a
28 kDa protein. Both immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining showed
a good reactivity of CD151 mAb 9B in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of HCC
cells, as well as in liver cells. In vitro assays demonstrated that CD151 mAb 9B could
inhibit neoangiogenesis and both the mobility and the invasiveness of HCC cells. An
in vivo assay showed that CD151 mAb 9B inhibited tumor growth potential and HCC
cells metastasis. We successfully produced a CD151 mAb 9B targeting the CD151/
integrin `6β1-binding domain, which not only can displayed good reactivity to the
CD151 antigen but also prevented tumor progression in HCC.

Tetraspanin CD151, one of the most important
members of the tetraspanins, has been identified as an
important player in physiological processes [6] and the
progression of malignant tumors [7], including skin [8],
pancreas [9], lung [10], colon [11] and breast tumors
[12, 13]. Consistent with relevant reports, our serial
studies implicated CD151 in several pathological
processes, including tumor cell mobility [14], tumor
neo-angiogenesis [15] and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) [4] in HCCs. A distinct feature of
CD151 is its ability to self-assemble or associate with

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most
common malignant neoplasm worldwide [1]. Disease
outcomes have been attributed to (1) early distant
metastasis and high rates of recurrence after intervention
[2] and (2) a lack of effective and curative interventions
[3, 4]. An increased understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying this disease may give us insight
into potential targets for developing new preventive and
therapeutic options for HCC [5].

other transmembrane molecules to form tetraspaninenriched microdomains (TEM) [6]. Among the associated
partners, integrins are the principal group of proteins that
interact with tetraspanin CD151 [6]. Previously, we also
identified a group of partners that associated with CD151
in the HCC cell line HCCLM3 [16]. Additionally, we
validated the role of the CD151/integrin α6β1 complex in
the progression of HCC [16]. Therefore, both CD151 and
CD151-enriched microdomains appears to be promising
targets in the treatment of HCC [17]. However, simple
inhibition of CD151 in HCC is evidently inappropriate
because CD151 plays essential roles in normal
physiological processes, including cell adhesion, motility,
activation and proliferation [6, 18–20]. Based on the above
evidence, the dissociation of CD151-depedent TEM could
be an effective strategy for inhibiting CD151’s tumorpromoting abilities without disrupting its physiological
functions [17].
Molecular targeted therapies have provided
researchers with a broader perspective on the management of
cancer, including colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers
[21, 22]. Clinical trials have demonstrated that sorafenib,
a multikinase inhibitor against Raf-1, B-Raf, VEGFR2,
PDGFR and c-Kit receptors, improves progression-free
survival in advanced HCC [23]. The benefit derived from

sorafenib for advanced HCC patients is significant, but the
drug prolongs mean survival by only 3 months compared
with placebo [23]. Moreover, adverse events such as
diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and hand-food skin reactions
are frequent and limit the use of sorafenib for HCC patients.
Therefore, it is important to develop alternative monoclonal
antibodies for HCC [24]. In this study, we generated a
CD151 mAb 9B (IgG1, κ) against the CD151/integrin α6β1binding domain and determined its bioactivity in HCC cells.

RESULTS
Characterization of CD151 mAb 9B
A mouse anti-human CD151 mAb against the
CD151/integrin α6β1 binding site [25] (Figure 1A,
QRD194-196 site) was successfully produced and designated
as CD151 mAb 9B. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie brilliant
blue revealed two bands, including a light chain at
28 kDa and a heavy chain at 52 kDa (Figure 1B). The
immunoisotype of CD151 mAb 9B was identified as
IgG1 (Figure 1C). Western blotting using CD151 mAb
9B as the first antibody showed a band at 28 kDa in
both HCCLM3 cell lysates and recombinant CD151
proteins (Figure 1D). A co-immunoprecipitation (IP)

assay also showed that CD151 mAb 9B effectively
immunoprecipitated CD151 protein as efficiently as the
anti-CD151 antibody purchased from Abcam, which
recognizes a different epitope of CD151. Interestingly, the
integrin α6 protein cannot be detected by Western blotting
from immuno-complex mixtures immunoprecipitated by
CD151 mAb 9B, whereas integrin α6 can be detected
from immuno-complex mixtures immunoprecipitated by
the other anti-CD151 antibody. These results may indicate
that CD151 mAb 9B competitively binds to the epitope
through which integrin α6 binds to CD151 (Figure 1E).
It was confirmed in our previous study that CD151 forms
a complex with integrin α6, inducing Akt signaling. The
results of the current study showed that treatment with
0.2 mg/ml of CD151 mAb 9B significantly decreased
p-Akt expression in HCCLM3 cells (Figure 1F).

the plasma membrane of tumor cells (Figure 2A). CD151
protein expression was detected in 30 pairs of HCC tumor
and nontumor samples using immunohistochemical
staining with CD151 mAb 9B. The results also showed
that the immunoreactivity of CD151 was localized to the
plasma membrane of the tumor cells and that the intensity
of CD151 immunoreactivity in the HCC tissues was
stronger than that in the paratumoral samples (Figure 2B
and C, p<0.01).
A FACS assay was performed to test the binding
efficiency of CD151 mAb 9B with the conformational
epitope of CD151 QRD194-196 in HCC cells. The results
indicated that CD151 mAb 9B bound to CD151 in the
HCCLM3 cells efficiently; however CD151 mAb 9B did
not bind to any proteins in the extracts from the HepG2
cells, which express low levels of CD151 (Figure 2D).

assess its role in the mobility of tumor cells. The result
showed an apparent decrease in the migratory ability
of HCC cells treated with 0.2 mg/ml of CD151 mAb
9B. Representative photography indicated accelerated
wound closure in the control cells (Figure 3A). This
indicated that the migratory ability of the HCC cells was
markedly suppressed after the administration of CD151
mAb 9B. Next, a transwell assay was used to investigate
the role of CD151 mAb 9B in the invasiveness of tumor
cells. The result showed that the average number of
invaded cells significantly decreased after treatment
with 0.2 mg/ml of CD151 mAb 9B compared with that
of the control cells (Figure 3B, p<0.05). Third, a matrigel
angiogenesis assay demonstrated that significantly more
integrated capillary-like structures were found in the
HUVECs cultured with DMEM and 10% fetal bovine
serum than in the HUVECs supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml
of CD151 mAb 9B (Figure 3C). However, we further
determined the effect of the CD151 mAb 9B on the growth
of the HCC cells and found that CD151 mAb 9B does not
affect the proliferation of HCC cells (Figure 3D, p>0.05).

To further investigate the role of CD151 mAb 9B
in vivo, we used a subcutaneous metastasis model to
assay its impact on the efficiency of tumor growth and
progression. The results revealed that the tumor volume
and weight of the HCCLM3 cell-derived xenografts treated
with 25 mg/kg CD151 mAb 9B was much lower than that
in of the HCCLM3 cell-derived xenografts treated with
PBS (Figure 4A, B and C;741.3 ± 191.4 mm3 vs. 1195.2
± 202.5 mm3, 3.42 ± 0.88 g vs. 5.51 ± 0.93 g).
The microvessel density (MVDs) of HCCLM3
cell-derived xenografts treated with PBS were 217.69 ±
24.13/0.74 mm2 and were larger than those of the HCCLM3
cell-derived xenografts treated with 25 mg/kg CD151 mAb
9B (12.68 ± 2.47/0.74 mm2) (Figure 4D, p<0.01). CD151
expression in the HCCLM3 cell-derived xenografts treated
with PBS was stronger than in the HCCLM3 cell-derived
xenografts treated with 25 mg/kg CD151 mAb 9B (Figure

4D, p<0.05). These results indicate that CD151 mAb 9B
inhibits neoangiogenesis through blockage of CD151dependent TEM in HCC tissues.
Pulmonary metastases occurred in 66.7% (4/6) of
the PBS group. However, a lower rate was observed in
the CD151 mAb 9B group (16.7%, 1/6; Figure 4E). These
data indicate that CD151 mAb 9B can inhibit tumor
growth and the progression of HCC cells in vivo.

and invasiveness of HCC cells in vitro. On the other hand,
CD151 mAb 9B also inhibited growth and lung metastasis
in vivo. Interestingly, CD151 mAb 9B had a minimal
effect on the proliferation of HCC cells in vitro. These data
indicate that CD151 mAb 9B plays an important role in the
progression of HCC by targeting the CD151/integrin α6β1binding; therefore, CD151 mAb 9B could overcome the
limitation of CD151 blockage in HCC.
In conclusion, we successfully produced a CD151
mAb 9B that competitively binds to the tetraspanin
CD151/integrin α6β1-binding domain. This mAb may
be widely used for the detection of the expression and
localization of the CD151 antigen in HCCs. More
importantly, CD151 mAb 9B may be an efficient method
for inhibiting of the progression of HCCs.

DISCUSSION
Previously, our studies showed that CD151 is
an important player in several processes during the
progression of HCC [4, 14–16] and is considered an ideal
therapeutic target for HCC [4, 14–17]. In the present study,
we successfully produced a CD151 mAb 9B targeting
tetraspanin CD151.
Intriguingly, the expression of CD151 was
significantly reduced after CD151 mAb 9B treatment in
vivo, which would be expected to result in reductions of
both p-Akt and CD34 expression, as well as a reduced
rate of lung metastasis. The alteration of these downstream
molecular signals and phenotypes was similar to that
observed in CD151 knockdown HCC cells [26]. It should
be noted that a similar assay was applied in vitro as well.
The above similarity suggests that CD151 mAb 9B exerts
its antitumor effect though competitive binding to the
tetraspanin CD151/integrin α6β1-binding domain.
In a previous study, we identified a set of proteins
associated with CD151 in HCCLM3 cells (Established in
Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital) and identified
an important role for the CD151/integrin α6β1 complex in
the progression of HCC [16]. Therefore, CD151-dependent
TEM appears to be promising therapeutic targets for
HCC [17]. Given that CD151 implicates in physiological
processes, such as cell adhesion, motility, activation and
proliferation [6, 18–20], simple blockage of CD151 in HCC
is evidently inappropriate. Based on the above evidence, the
dissociation of CD151-depedent TEM could be an effective
strategy for inhibiting CD151’s tumor-promoting abilities
without disrupting its physiological functions [17]. Recent
studies have shown that the QRD194–196 site of CD151 was
required for binding with integrin α6β1 and its epitope
[25]. In the present study, we chemically synthesized
peptides of the CD151/integrin α6β1-binding domain
(GQRDHASNIYKVEGGC) and then successfully produced
a CD151 mAb 9B with a molecular weight of 28kDa.
Second, CD151 mAb 9B displayed good reactivity to the
CD151 antigen in HCCs. The newly synthesized antibody
not only accurately reflected the intensity of the CD151
antigen by Western blotting but also correctly displayed the
localization of the CD151 antigen by immunofluorescent
and immunohistochemical staining, which indicates that it
can be used in detection of the expression and localization
of CD151 antigen in basic research. Third, CD151 mAb 9B
showed good bioactivity for HCCs. On one hand, the newly
synthesized antibody significantly inhibited the mobility

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and animals
HCC cell lines HCCLM3, MHCC97-L (established
in Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital [27]),
HepG2 (American Type Culture Collection) and SP2/0
myeloma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were
used in this study and routinely raised. Male BALB/c
mice (8 weeks old) and male athymic BALB/c nude mice
(4 weeks old) were purchased from the Shanghai Institute
of Material Medicine and raised in specific pathogenfree conditions. Animal care was provided according to
the guidelines established by the Zhongshan Hospital
Experimental Animal Care Commission.

Sample collection
Thirty pairs of fresh tumor and corresponding
nontumor samples were collected from consecutive
HCC patients who underwent curative resection at
Zhongshan Hospital. All HCC samples were identified by
histopathological examination. Of these 30 patients, 26
patients had a history of hepatitis B. No patients received
preoperative anticancer treatment. Ethical approval was
provided by the research ethics committee of Zhongshan
Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from
each patient.

Preparation and purification of anti-CD151
monoclonal antibodies
The monoclonal antibody was produced as
previously described [28]. Briefly, small peptides were
designed according to the CD151/integrin α6β1-binding
domain
(GQRDHASNIYKVEGGC),
chemically
synthesized and coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin
(KLH). BALB/c mice were immunized with CD151/
integrin α6β1 binding domain recombinant peptides.
Splenocyte fusion was performed with SP2/0 myeloma
cells, from which hybridomas of the desired characteristics

protein G. The immunoglobulin subtype of the antibody
was determined using an antibody isotyping kit (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The
purified mAb was named CD151 mAb 9B and used for
subsequent experiments.

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with or
without 0.2 mg/ml CD151 mAb 9B.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was analyzed using a 3-(4,5)dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di- phenytetrazoliumromide
(MTT) assay as previously described [14]. These cells were
raised with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 0.2 mg/ml CD151 mAb 9B or IgG.

Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation
(co-IP), immunofluorescent (IF) and
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
Western blotting was performed as previously
described [15]. CD151 mAb 9B (1:2000) was used to
detect the expression of CD151 in three HCC cell lines
and tumor samples from 30 patients. β-actin (1:5,000;
Chemicon, USA) was used as an internal control. CoIP was conducted as previously described [16]. Five
milligrams of CD151 mAb 9B was used to extract
CD151 from the HCCLM3 lysates (250 mg). The gel
was stained using the PlusOne Coomassie brilliant blue
(Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescent staining was
performed as previously described [14]. The expression
and localization of CD151 protein in HCCLM3 cells
were assayed using the CD151 mAb 9B (1:200). The
immunohistochemistry protocols are described elsewhere
[14]. CD151 mAb 9B (1:200) detected the expression
of CD151 in the HCC samples. Positive staining was
measured as described in our previous report [14].

In vivo metastasis assays and
immunohistochemical analysis
A total of 6.0×106 HCCLM3 cells were used for
subcutaneous xenografts in a spontaneous metastasis
assay as previously described [15]. When the tumors
reached a mean tumor volume of 100 mm3, the mice
were randomly allocated into two groups (n=6); 25
mg/kg of either CD151 mAb 9B or phosphate buffer
saline (PBS) was administered intraperitoneally three
times per week for two weeks, and the diameter of the
xenografts was monitored twice a week. The xenografts
and visceral organs, including the lungs, were examined
histopathologically. Tumor volume, weight, and the total
number of lung metastases were assayed as previously
described [30, 31].
Mouse anti-human CD34 antibodies (1:100;
DakoCytomation, Denmark) and CD151 mAb 9B were
used to measure microvessel density (MVD) and CD151
expression. MVD and CD151 were evaluated as described
elsewhere [15].

FACS analysis
A total of 1 × 106 cells were collected by
centrifugation and incubated with 20 μg/ml of either
CD151 mAb 9B or IgG in PBS containing 1% newborn
calf serum for 45 min at 4°C. After being washed with cold
PBS three times, the cells were incubated for an additional
45 min at 4°C with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody
(Kang-Chen Bio-tech, Shanghai, China) in the dark. The
cells were then analyzed by FACS cytometry (Beckman
Coulter Epics Altra, Miami, FL).

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS
16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Values are expressed as the
mean ± standard deviation. Quantitative data between
groups were compared using Student’s t test. Categorical
data were analyzed using the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test.
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Wound healing, invasion assay and matrigel
angiogenesis assay

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

A wound-healing assay was used to evaluate the
effect of CD151 mAb 9B on cell migration [29]. These
cells were raised in serum-free medium supplemented
with or without 0.2 mg/ml CD151 mAb 9B. The invasion
assay was performed as described elsewhere [14]. The
supernatant of NIH3T3 in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum with or without 0.2 mg/ml CD151
mAb 9B, which served as a chemoattractant, was placed
in the lower chamber. All experiments were performed in
triplicate. The Matrigel angiogenesis assay was performed
as described previously [15]. The human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured with DMEM
