BACKGROUND. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of single-agent
weekly docetaxel with the combination of docetaxel and gemcitabine in elderly
and/or poor performance status patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

METHODS. Previously untreated patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who were either >65 years old or had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2 were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive weekly
docetaxel (36 mg/m2) Days 1, 8, and 15 or docetaxel (30 mg/m2)/gemcitabine
(800 mg/m2) Days 1, 8, and 15. Both regimens were repeated on 28-day cycles
for 6 cycles or until disease progression.

RESULTS. Three hundred fifty patients were randomized, and 345 received treatment. The median age of patients was 74 years; 38% were >75 years old, and
35% had ECOG performance status 2. Intent-to-treat analysis showed median
survivals of 5.5 months versus 5.1 months in the groups receiving docetaxel/gemcitabine versus weekly docetaxel, respectively (P 5 .65). There were no survival
differences detected with docetaxel/gemcitabine versus weekly docetaxel in the
223 patients with good performance status (7.2 months vs 8.0 months, respectively) or in the 122 poor performance status patients (3.8 months vs 2.9 months,
respectively). Median time-to-progression was longer in patients who received
docetaxel/gemcitabine (4.8 months vs 2.9 months; P 5 .004). Both regimens were
generally well tolerated.

CONCLUSIONS. Treatment with docetaxel/gemcitabine produced a modest
improvement in time-to-progression but had no impact on survival when compared with single-agent weekly docetaxel in this group of patients. Results with
both regimens were disappointing, particularly in patients with poor performance
status. Improved treatment for these patients will require the introduction of
novel, well-tolerated, targeted agents. Cancer 2007;110:2027–34.  2007 American

reatment with platinum-based combination chemotherapy
improves survival in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) who have good performance status, and platinumbased combination chemotherapy is now considered the standard
of care.1–4 However, the optimal treatment of patients who are elderly or who have poor performance status is less clearly defined.
Platinum-based regimens have consistently produced more toxicity

in these patient groups when compared with treatment of younger patients.5–7 Efficacy evaluations of
various regimens have produced somewhat more
conflicting results. In retrospective subset analyses of
large phase 3 trials, elderly patients with good performance status and younger patients derived similar
benefit from treatment with platinum-based combinations.2,5,6 However, in a large phase 3 trial
designed specifically for elderly patients, single-agent
treatment with either gemcitabine or vinorelbine was
equivalent to the nonplatinum-containing combination of gemcitabine/vinorelbine.8
To further investigate the optimal treatment for
elderly and poor performance status patients, we
performed a randomized phase 3 study that compared single-agent versus combination chemotherapy. For the single agent, we chose weekly docetaxel,
which we had previously demonstrated to be active
and well tolerated in this patient population.9 At the
time we started this trial, there was less information
on weekly docetaxel than either gemcitabine or
vinorelbine. However, single-agent docetaxel has
since been found to be more active than vinorelbine.10 For the combination regimen, we chose docetaxel/gemcitabine, a regimen we had previously
evaluated in a phase 2 trial.11 When we compared
our sequential phase 2 trials, the overall response
rates (28% vs 19%) and median survivals (7 months
vs 5 months) suggested an improvement with docetaxel/gemcitabine versus single-agent docetaxel.
However, these relatively small differences led us to a
more definitive comparison; results of our randomized phase 3 trial are now reported.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient enrollment in this multicenter, randomized,
phase 3 study was initiated in August 2001. This
study was conducted within the Minnie Pearl Cancer
Research Network, a community-based, collaborative,
clinical trials group.

Patient Eligibility
Patients eligible for this study were required to have
American Joint Commission on Cancer stage IIIB or
stage IV, biopsy-proven NSCLC (adenocarcinoma,
squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, or
mixtures of these histologies). Patients with stage
IIIB disease were eligible only if they had malignant
pleural effusions. In addition, patients were required
to be older than 65 years of age or to be poor candidates for standard platinum-based chemotherapy
regimens because of either coexistent medical illness
or poor performance status. Patients were required

to be previously untreated with chemotherapy; previous surgical resection and/or radiation therapy was
permitted. Additional inclusion criteria included
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2; measurable or evaluable
disease; adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 1500/lL, platelets 100,000/lL,
hemoglobin 8 g/dL); adequate liver function (serum
bilirubin <1.4 mg/dL, and serum glutamic oxaloacetic
transaminase [SGOT] <2.53 upper limits of normal);
serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL.
Patients were excluded if they had parenchymal
brain metastases or meningeal metastases. The single
exception was the patient with a solitary brain metastasis, previously treated with definitive resection
and/or radiation therapy, with no residual metastasis
on computed tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). Other excluded patients
included those who had had a major surgical procedure within 4 weeks; pre-existing peripheral neuropathy >grade 1; other invasive cancers treated within
5 years; and pregnant or lactating females.
All patients were required to give written
informed consent before study entry. This study was
approved by the TriStar Institutional Review Board
and by the local institutional review boards of all
participating network sites.

Pretreatment Evaluation
Before beginning therapy, all patients were evaluated
with routine history, physical examination, chemistry
profile, and complete blood counts. Tumor staging
included CT scans of the chest and abdomen. In addition, either CTor MRI of the head was required. A radionuclide bone scan or a positron emission tomographic
(PET) scan was also required in patients with skeletal
symptoms. All radiologic evaluation was performed
within 3 weeks of study entry; laboratory evaluations
were performed within 1 week of study entry.
Treatment Plan
Patients were randomized to receive either weekly
docetaxel as a single agent (Regimen A) or the combination of docetaxel 1 gemcitabine (Regimen B).
Patients randomized to Regimen A received docetaxel
36 mg/m2 by 30-minute intravenous infusion on Days
1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Patients randomized
to Regimen B received gemcitabine 800 mg/m2, 30minute IV infusion, followed by docetaxel 30 mg/m2,
30-minute IV infusion; both drugs were administered
on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Standard
hypersensitivity and antiemetic prophylaxis were
administered before each dose of chemotherapy.

Treatment of Elderly NSCLC Patients/Hainsworth et al.

All patients were re-evaluated for response to
treatment after they had completed 2 courses (8 weeks)
of therapy. Patients with objective response or stable
disease at the time of re-evaluation continued therapy, and they were reevaluated every 8 weeks.
Patients continued treatment until disease progression or for a recommended 6 courses (24 weeks) of
therapy.

Dose Modifications
Parameters for dose modifications necessitated by
myelosuppression were based on blood counts on
the day of scheduled treatment and were identical
for Regimens A and B. Patients with ANC >1500/lL
and platelet count >100,000/lL received a full dose
of treatment. Patients with an ANC of 1000–1500/lL
or a platelet count of 75,000–100,000/lL received a
75% dose. Patients with ANC <1000/lL or platelet
count <75,000/lL had the scheduled dose omitted,
and they were re-evaluated on the day of the next
scheduled treatment. If the counts had improved to
ANC >1000/lL and platelet count >75,000/lL, then
patients received treatment with 75% doses. The duration of each course of treatment was always
28 days. If patients had a dose omitted because of
myelosuppression, the treatment cycle was not
lengthened; rather, the patient was re-evaluated on
the date of the next scheduled dose, and treatment
proceeded as described above. A maximum of 2 dose
reductions were allowed; if myelosuppression continued to limit dosing, then the patient was removed
from study. If blood counts failed to return to acceptable minimum levels after 3 weeks, the patient was
removed from study. Growth factors (G-CSF or GMCSF) were not used routinely in this study, and they
were not substituted for a protocol-mandated dose
modification. However, use of growth factors during
treatment of neutropenic fever, or as prophylaxis following such an episode, was at the discretion of the
treating physician.
Patients who experienced other grade 3 or 4
nonhematologic toxicities (with the exception of nausea, vomiting, or alopecia) had treatment withheld
until the toxicity had improved to grade 1 or less.
Treatment was then resumed using a 75% dose of
the offending drug. Any grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic
toxicity that did not improve to grade 1 after 3 weeks
resulted in the discontinuation of treatment.
Definition of Treatment Response
All patients who received 8 weeks of therapy were
assigned a response category by their treating physician based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.12 (At the time this study was designed in late

2029

2000, the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
Tumors [RECIST] criteria had not yet become the
standard method of evaluating response to treatment.) In this study, there was no central review for
confirmation of responses.

Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of this study was to determine
whether the addition of gemcitabine to docetaxel
improved survival when compared with treatment
results with single-agent weekly docetaxel. The secondary objectives were to compare the objective
response rates, time to tumor progression, and toxicities of these 2 regimens. On the basis of previous clinical trials, treatment with weekly docetaxel was
expected to result in a 1-year survival rate of approximately 25% in this group of patients. To detect an
improvement of the 1-year survival to 40% with docetaxel/gemcitabine, randomization of a total of 330
patients was required (statistical type 1 error of 5%
and type 2 error of 20%). Assuming that approximately 5% of elderly patients entering trials for
advanced NSCLC are not evaluable for various reasons, the accrual goal for this trial was 346 patients.
Overall survival and time-to-progression were
plotted by Kaplan-Meier estimates,13 and differences
between groups were calculated according to the
log-rank test. Differences between groups for
response rate, baseline characteristics, and toxicity
were analyzed with the chi-square test. Time-to-progression was measured from the date of first treatment until the date of documented tumor progression.
Overall survival was measured from the date of first
treatment until the date of death. All patients who
received at least 1 dose of treatment were included
in the toxicity comparisons. Toxicity was measured
by Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 2.0 (published
by the National Cancer Institute, Cancer Therapy
Evaluation Program).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between August 2001 and March 2006, 350 patients
were enrolled by 39 participating sites in the Minnie
Pearl Cancer Research Network (Table 1). Five
patients never received any treatment and are
included only in the intent-to-treat analyses. Characteristics of the 345 patients who received at least 1
dose of treatment are summarized and compared in
Table 2. One hundred seventy-one patients received
weekly docetaxel, and 174 received docetaxel/gemcitabine. The median age for all patients in this study
was 74 years (range, 45 years to 91 years). Clinical

characteristics of these 2 groups were comparable,
including age, sex, performance status, histology, and
stage. Overall, 35% of patients in this trial had poor
performance status (ECOG-PS 2), and 132 (38%)
patients were older than 75 years. A total of 34 (10%)
patients were younger than 65 years; all of these
patients had poor performance status (ECOG-PS 2).

Treatment Administration
The 345 patients who were treated in this clinical
trial received a total of 1017 treatment cycles (docetaxel, 483 cycles; docetaxel/gemcitabine, 534 cycles).
The median number of cycles per patient was 2 for
both treatments used in this trial. Only 11% and 14%
of patients receiving docetaxel and docetaxel/gemcitabine, respectively, completed the planned 6 cycles

of treatment. The main reason for discontinuation of
treatment was disease progression (weekly docetaxel,
64%; docetaxel/gemcitabine, 55%). Treatment was
stopped prematurely because of treatment-related
toxicity in 15 (9%) patients who were receiving
weekly docetaxel, and in 22 (13%) patients who were
receiving docetaxel/gemcitabine. The remaining
patients (weekly docetaxel, 29 patients; docetaxel/
gemcitabine, 31 patients) were removed from treatment for a variety of reasons (eg, patient request,
intercurrent illness, physician decision); however, it
is likely that most of these patients also had progressive NSCLC that caused their decline in performance
status.
During the first 2 courses of therapy, the percentage of planned treatment administered in each arm
was as follows: weekly docetaxel, 95%; docetaxel/
gemcitabine, 84%.

Intent-to-Treat Analysis
At the time of analysis, 32 patients were alive after a
median follow-up of 22 months (range, 9 months to
52 months). Figure 1 shows a comparison of the

overall survival of patients treated with weekly docetaxel versus docetaxel/gemcitabine, based on an
intent-to-treat analysis of all 350 randomly assigned
patients. Survival comparisons for the weekly docetaxel and docetaxel/gemcitabine study arms, respectively, showed no significant differences (P 5 .65) and
were as follows: median survival, 5.1 months versus
5.5 months; 1-year survival rate, 24% versus 26%;
and 2-year survival rate, 9% versus 8%.

Analyses According to Protocol
After excluding, according to protocol, the 5 patients
who did not receive any treatment, 345 patients
(weekly docetaxel, n 5 171; docetaxel/gemcitabine,
n 5 174) remained by protocol for analyses. Comparison of the treated groups is almost identical to the
intent-to-treat population and shows no survival difference based on treatment received (docetaxel/gemcitabine, 5.6 months; docetaxel, 5.1 months; P 5 .64).
Because elderly patients with good performance
status are now recognized as a distinct group from
patients with poor performance status, these 2 subsets are compared separately. Figure 2 compares the
overall survival of all good performance status
patients in this trial treated with weekly docetaxel
(n 5 114) versus docetaxel/gemcitabine (n 5 109).
Although both subgroups had modestly better outcomes (median survivals, 8.0 months vs 7.2 months,
respectively), survival was not statistically different
(P 5 .5) when these subgroups were compared. Separate comparisons of good performance status
patients >70 years and >75 years of age also showed
no differences on the basis of treatment regimen.
Both treatments performed poorly in patients with
ECOG performance status 2; patients who received
docetaxel (n 5 57) had a median survival of 2.9 months

versus 3.8 months (P 5 .62) for patients who received
docetaxel/gemcitabine (n 5 65) (Fig. 3).

Time-to-Progression
Among the 345 patients considered eligible for analysis according to protocol, the median time-to-progression was 2.9 months (95% confidence interval
[CI], 2.0–3.6 months) for patients who received weekly
docetaxel versus 4.8 months (95% CI, 3.9–6.2 months)
for those who received docetaxel/gemcitabine
(P 5 .004) (Fig. 4). The percentage of progression-free
patients at 1 year was also higher for patients who
received docetaxel/gemcitabine (11% vs 21%).
Overall Response Rate
A total of 256 patients received at least 2 courses of
treatment and were evaluable for response (weekly
docetaxel, n 5 130; docetaxel/gemcitabine, n 5 126).
Of the 130 evaluable patients who received weekly
docetaxel, there were 2 complete responders and 20
partial responders (overall response rate 17%; 95%

patients had partial responses (overall response rate
25%; 95% CI, 18%–34%; P 5 .10).

Toxicity
A total of 345 patients (weekly docetaxel, n 5 171;
docetaxel/gemcitabine, n 5 174) received at least 1
dose of study drug and were included in the toxicity
analysis. The grade 3 and 4 toxicities encountered by
patients treated in this trial are summarized in Table
3. Both treatments were well tolerated by most
patients. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, and anemia was significantly
higher in patients who received docetaxel/gemcitabine. In addition, more patients who were receiving
docetaxel/gemcitabine required erythrocyte transfusions. Hospitalization for treatment of neutropenic
fever was uncommon with either treatment. Severe
nonhematologic toxicity was uncommon; fatigue was
the only adverse event that occurred in >10% of
patients. One patient who was receiving docetaxel/
gemcitabine developed fatal pulmonary infiltrates
with hypoxia, possibly related to treatment.
Both treatment regimens were tolerable in all
patient subgroups, including patients with poor performance status and those aged 75 years or older. A
higher percentage of poor performance status reported treatment-related fatigue with either regimen
(docetaxel, 21% vs 15%; docetaxel/gemcitabine, 22%
vs 16%). The rates of hematologic toxicity and other
nonhematologic toxicities did not vary significantly
with age or performance status.

DISCUSSION
The treatment of advanced NSCLC remains difficult,
particularly in patients who are elderly or have poor

performance status. When this trial was designed,
limited data were available on the efficacy of new
nonsmall cell lung cancer regimens in these patients,
and it was common to consider elderly and poor
performance status patients as a single, large group.
The currently accepted definition of ‘‘elderly’’ as
being >70 years of age was also less firmly established. More recently, it has become increasingly evident that this population is heterogeneous; patients
with poor performance status consistently have short
median survival, whereas some elderly patients with
good performance status have prognoses similar to
that of younger patients. This favorable subset of elderly patients (ie, good performance status, usually
<75 years of age) has recently been highlighted in
retrospective subset analyses of several large randomized trials.2,5,6,14,15 In these trials, patients older
than 70 years derived similar benefits from 2-drug,
platinum-based regimens as did the entire group. In
the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial
reported by Lilenbaum, patients who were ages
70 years and older (27% of the study population) had
superior outcomes when treated with the combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone,
similar to results found in the entire study population.2 Although not yet confirmed by prospective trial
results, current recommendations for treatment of
elderly patients with good performance status are
identical to those for younger patients with good
performance status.
Despite convincing data in selected good performance status elderly patients, it remains difficult
to estimate the frequency of these patients among
the entire group of elderly and/or poor performance
status patients. In all of the phase 3 trials from which
retrospective subset analyses arose, elderly patients
accounted for <30% of the total patient population,
and the large majority of these were between 70 and
75 years of age.2,5,14,15 Limited evaluation is available
on treatment outcomes of patients aged 75–80 years;
those older than 80 years have consistently tolerated
treatment poorly and had inferior outcomes.16,17 It is
clear that a sizeable percentage of elderly patients
are not ideal candidates for platinum-based doublets,
based on either poor performance status or greatly
advanced age.
Considerable effort has been focused on the development of effective regimens for elderly patients
that are better tolerated than the traditional platinum-based combinations. Several single agents have
demonstrated activity in this patient population;
vinorelbine proved superior to best supportive care
in a randomized phase 3 trial.18 Recently, singleagent docetaxel produced superior survival when

compared with single-agent vinorelbine in a randomized trial (14.3 months vs 9.9 months, respectively;
P 5 .06).10 Nonplatinum-containing doublets, such as
gemcitabine/vinorelbine, have also been well tolerated by elderly patients.8,19 However, in 1 large randomized trial reported by Gridelli et al., the
combination of gemcitabine/vinorelbine was no
more effective than either agent used alone.8 Therefore, the benefit of nonplatinum doublets in this
population has not been substantiated, and singleagent therapy remains the treatment of choice.
In the randomized phase 3 study reported here,
we compared single-agent weekly docetaxel with the
combination of docetaxel/gemcitabine. Both of the
regimens were active and well tolerated by this
patient group in our previously reported phase 2
trials.9,11 Because we conducted this trial in a multicenter, community-based setting, the population of
patients accrued is almost certainly different from
those entered in large cooperative group trials. The
median age of patients in this trial was 74 years, and
38% of patients were older than 75 years. In addition,
35% of patients had poor performance status (ECOGPS 2). In this relatively heterogeneous group, the survival of patients who received single-agent docetaxel
versus docetaxel/gemcitabine was similar. The timeto-progression was modestly improved with the com-

bination regimen. Median survivals for both groups
were disappointing (docetaxel, 5.1 months vs docetaxel/gemcitabine, 5.5 months), although similar to
the 5-month median survival in our previous phase 2
trial of weekly docetaxel.9 When the subsets of
patients with good performance status were compared, median survivals were substantially better (8.0
months vs 7.2 months, respectively), and they are
similar to those reported in this patient population
from large trials that used platinum-based doublets.2,5,14–16 Although the currently reported trial was
not sufficiently large to allow a definitive comparison, docetaxel/gemcitabine and weekly docetaxel
produced similar survival in this favorable subset of
patients. As expected, median survivals for ECOG-PS
2 patients were poor in both groups (2.9 months vs
3.8 months, respectively).
The results of this randomized phase 3 trial,
therefore, reinforce those previously reported by
Gridelli et al. and provide further evidence that treatment with a single agent produces similar results
and less toxicity than does a nonplatinum combination regimen. Although it may be appropriate to
select patients with good performance status and
<75 years of age for platinum-based combination
regimens, single-agent treatment should be considered for the remainder of this large population. In

the future, clinical trials should focus on more sharply defined subsets within this group. Specific subsets that require further evaluation are good
performance status patients >75 years of age and
patients with poor performance status.
Unfortunately, the results of this trial reveal the
limitations of current therapy in this large group of
lung cancer patients. It is likely that the modest benefit produced by 2-drug chemotherapy regimens in
younger, good performance status patients is negated
in an unselected group of elderly patients because of
a combination of increased toxicity and difficulties in
treatment delivery. In the future, substantial treatment advances in this group will require development of novel agents with better toxicity profiles.
