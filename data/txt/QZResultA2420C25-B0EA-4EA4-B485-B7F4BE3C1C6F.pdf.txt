BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to determine recurrence patterns and survival outcomes of stage
I uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) patients. METHODS: A retrospective, multi-institutional study
of stage I UPSC patients diagnosed from 1993 to 2006 was performed. Patients underwent comprehensive
surgical staging; postoperative treatment included observation (OBS); radiotherapy alone (RT); or platinum/taxane–based chemotherapy (CT)  RT. RESULTS: The authors identified 142 patients with a median
follow-up of 37 months (range, 7-144 months). Thirty-three patients were observed, 20 received RT alone,
and 89 received CT  RT. Twenty-five recurrences (17.6%) were diagnosed, and 60% were extrapelvic.
Chemotherapy-treated patients experienced significantly fewer recurrences than those treated without
chemotherapy (P ¼ .013). Specifically, CT  RT patients had a lower risk of recurrence (11.2%) compared
with patients who received RT alone (25%, P ¼ .146) or OBS (30.3%, P ¼ .016). This effect was most pronounced in stage IB/IC (P ¼ .007). CT- and CT þ RT–treated patients experienced similar recurrence. After
multivariate analysis, treatment with chemotherapy was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence (P
¼ .047). The majority of recurrences (88%) were not salvageable. Progression-free survival (PFS) and
cause-specific survival (CSS) for chemotherapy-treated patients were more favorable than for those who
did not receive chemotherapy (P ¼ .013 and .081). Five-year PFS and CSS rates were 81.5% and 87.6% in CT
 RT, 64.1% and 59.5% in RT alone, and 64.7% and 70.2% for OBS. CONCLUSIONS: Stage I UPSC patients
have significant risk for extrapelvic recurrence and poor survival. Recurrence and survival outcomes are
improved in well-staged patients treated with platinum/taxane–based chemotherapy. This multi-institutional study is the largest to support systemic therapy for early stage UPSC patients. Cancer

KEY WORDS: uterine carcinoma, papillary serous, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, survival.

Although uterine papillary serous carcinoma
(UPSC) represents <10% of all endometrial cancers, it
accounts for up to 39% of endometrial cancer-related
deaths.1 UPSC, the prototype of type II endometrial cancer, is characterized by high-grade, complex histology and
is biologically more aggressive than its type I counterpart,
endometrioid adenocarcinoma.2 In addition, UPSC has a
propensity for lymphatic and vascular space invasion,
even in the setting of minimal or no uterine invasion.
These tumor characteristics lead to high recurrence rates
and a poor prognosis.3-5
Approximately 50% of women with UPSC have
early stage disease after comprehensive surgical staging.
Because of poor results with surgery alone, radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been added postoperatively
to improve outcomes.1,2 However, the benefit of these
modalities and the optimal treatment for each disease
stage remain unclear. Randomized studies are absent, and
most retrospective series are confounded by the inclusion
of a heterogeneous patient population treated by variable
approaches. Most reports include small numbers of
women who were not surgically staged, although 3 recent
reports included comprehensively staged patients.6-8
These studies have collectively demonstrated the value of
platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of stage
I UPSC.
Although the evidence for platinum-based chemotherapy is compelling, it is unclear whether all stage I
patients would benefit from chemotherapy, what the margin of benefit would be, and whether the addition of pelvic radiotherapy (RT) would further reduce recurrence.
Specifically, patterns of recurrence have not been well
defined for women undergoing multimodality treatment
in early stage disease. Furthermore, in recent studies,

paclitaxel or other taxanes and platinum/taxane combinations have also demonstrated significant activity in endometrial carcinoma.9,10 Therefore, the purpose of this
study was to determine the patterns of recurrence and survival outcomes of surgical stage I UPSC patients treated
with platinum/taxane–based chemotherapy regimens
with or without radiation treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a multi-institutional, institutional review board–
approved retrospective study involving 9 US academic
centers. The study period was 1993-2006 and was chosen
to have at least 2 years of clinical follow-up time for most
subjects. Subjects were identified by pathology and tumor
registry databases. Inclusion criteria were stage I patients
who were comprehensively staged according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging
classification (hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy/pelvic and para-aortic lymph node assessment 
omentectomy) with at least 10% UPSC in the pathologic
specimen (by the Hendrickson criteria).11 Pathology was
initially reviewed by a gynecologic pathologist at each center to confirm the UPSC diagnosis. After surgery, patients
were treated with either observation (OBS) alone, 3
cycles platinum/taxane–based chemotherapy (CT) alone,
RT alone (vaginal brachytherapy [VcRT], whole pelvic
RT [WPRT], or a combination [WPRT þ Vc]), or CT þ
RT. Patients with a previous or current diagnosis of other
gynecologic or gastrointestinal malignancy were excluded.
Abstraction of data from patient medical records
for demographics, clinicopathologic variables, and clinical
outcomes was performed. The primary objectives were
to determine patterns of recurrence of disease and

progression-free survival (PFS) by adjuvant treatment
modality. The secondary objectives were to perform a
subgroup analysis of patients treated by platinum/taxane–
based CT versus CT þ RT and to determine causespecific survival (CSS) outcomes based on stage and treatment. Sample size calculations demonstrated a requirement of 150 stage I patients (in a ratio of 2:1 for
treatment with CT vs no CT) to identify a 20% difference
in PFS between treatment modalities. This is based on
published 5-year PFS rates of 60% to 65% for women
with stage I UPSC.

RT patients was also performed. PFS and CSS were calculated from the date of diagnosis until the date of first disease progression and date of death from disease, and date
of last status if the patient was alive. Data concerning
patients without disease progression or death at last follow-up were considered censored. Survival curves were
generated according to the Kaplan-Meier product-limit
method and compared using the log-rank test. Statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS version 14.0 (Chicago, Ill).

A higher proportion of the OBS group were stage IA
patients (P ¼ .027). A mean of 18.6 (SD ¼ 10.0) lymph
nodes were surgically excised per patient, and the number
removed did not differ between groups (P ¼ .104).
Although removal of the omentum was not required for
study inclusion, 71.1% of patients had an omentectomy
performed. Histologically, 61.3% of patients had 50%
UPSC, with 51.4% containing pure UPSC in their respective uterine specimens. In patients with mixed histology specimens (n ¼ 89), 94.3% also had an endometrioid
component and 5.7% a clear cell component. Furthermore, polyp-confined disease was present in 37.3% of
stage IA patients.
Of 89 CT  RT patients, 56 received CT alone and
33 had CT þ RT. The majority of patients (97.2%)
received carboplatin and paclitaxel; the remainder
received cisplatin and paclitaxel. The median number of
CT cycles (5; range, 2-6) was not different between the
CT and CT þ RT groups (P ¼ .806). Of 53 patients
administered RT (either alone or CT-RT), 17/53
(32.1%) received VcRT, and 67.9% (36/53) received
WPRT  VcRT. RT modality did not differ between the
RT alone and CT þ RT groups (P ¼ .497). There were
no treatment-related deaths.
There were no differences in follow-up times
between adjuvant treatment groups (P ¼ .268). After a
median follow-up of 37.0 months (range, 7-144 months),
25 recurrences (17.6%) were observed. The overall risk of
recurrence (irrespective of adjuvant treatment) was 11.8%
for stage IA, 16.9% for stage IB, and 30.8% for stage IC
(P ¼ .115). The majority of recurrences (72%) occurred
within 2 years, and 60% were extrapelvic (Table 2). Of
the locoregional recurrences (10/25, 40%), 8 were vaginal, and 2 were pelvic. In the 4/89 patients with local
2122

relapse who received CT  RT, 2/4 occurred in patients
who received CT alone and 2/4 in patients who received
CT þ RT. In the latter group, 1 patient had received
whole pelvic radiation, and 1 had received vaginal brachytherapy. The extrapelvic recurrences (15/25, 60%) were
more varied in their distribution, occurring most often in
the upper abdomen/para-aortic region (n ¼ 7), chest (n ¼
3), lung (n ¼ 4), and brain (n ¼ 1). Ten of 25 patients
(40%) experienced a primary relapse at multiple sites.
OBS patients with stage IA disease (n ¼ 19) had a 15.8%
recurrence rate, including a patient with polyp-confined
disease who experienced an extrapelvic relapse. Sixty percent and 80% of recurrences occurred outside of the pelvis
in patients treated with CT  RT or RT alone, respectively (P ¼ .248).
Patients treated with platinum/taxane–based CT
had a significant reduction in recurrence (11.2%) when
compared with patients who did not receive CT (28.3%;
P ¼ .013), and there was an overall difference in recurrence based on individual adjuvant treatment strategy (P
¼ .032, Table 3). Specifically, CT  RT patients had a
lower risk of recurrence (11.2%) compared with patients
treated by RT (25.0%, P ¼ .146) or OBS (30.3%, P ¼
.016). The effect of treatment was most evident in stage
IB/IC patients (P ¼ .007), in which 7/14 (50.0%) OBS,
4/15 (26.7%) RT, and 8/62 (12.9%) CT  RT patients
experienced a recurrence. There was no reduction of
recurrences observed with the addition of RT. Of 10
recurrences in the CT  RT patients, 6/56 (10.7%) were
observed in those receiving CT alone and 4/33 (12.1%) in
patients receiving CT þ RT (P ¼ .999). Notably, most
recurrences (75%) in the RT and CT þ RT patients
occurred in patients who received whole pelvic radiation
therapy  vaginal brachytherapy.

95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.98; P ¼ .047), and
stage IC disease was associated with an increased risk of recurrence (OR, 5.38; 95% CI, 1.34-21.61; P ¼ .018). Age
was not associated with recurrence.
PFS for CT-treated patients was significantly higher
than for those who did not receive CT (P ¼ .013). When
analyzing individual treatment modalities, treatment with
CT  RT was associated with improved PFS compared
with treatment with RT alone or OBS (Fig. 1A, P ¼
.027). This difference in PFS was most pronounced in
stage IB/IC patients (Fig. 1B, P ¼ .001). A trend toward
improved CSS was observed in patients who received CT
versus those who did not (P ¼ .081). When analyzed by
individual treatment modalities, however, CSS did not
significantly differ between groups (Fig. 2, P ¼ .219).
Five-year PFS and CSS for all stage I patients were 81.5%
and 87.6% in CT  RT, 64.1% and 59.5% in RT alone,
and 64.7% and 70.2% in OBS patients.
The vast majority of recurrences (22/25, 88%) were
not salvaged. Eighteen (72%) patients have died of their
disease, with a median time from recurrence to death of
12 months (range, 1-29 months); 5 patients (20%) with
recurrence are alive with disease but have either experienced progression or only a partial response on salvage
therapy, and 2 patients (8%) are without evidence of disease after salvage therapy.

DISCUSSION
In the largest series of surgical stage I UPSC patients, we
demonstrate that UPSC is a systemic disease, and that
even early stage patients have a significant risk for extrapelvic recurrence. However, the recurrence risk in patients
Cancer

May 15, 2009

treated with platinum/taxane therapy  RT was low
(11.2%). Notably, on multivariate analysis, the risk of recurrence was significantly reduced in patients treated with
platinum/taxane  RT but not with RT alone. Moreover,
women who underwent treatment with CT—especially
those with stage IB and IC disease—experienced significantly better PFS outcomes when compared with patients
who received RT alone or OBS after surgery. This significant difference in recurrence and survival based on adjuvant treatment modality is an important finding, as most
recurrences were not salvaged (88%), and the majority of
women who recurred died of their disease within 1 year.
To our knowledge, this is the first study powered to
observe a survival difference based on adjuvant treatment.
All patients underwent a comprehensive staging procedure with a satisfactory number of lymph nodes evaluated per patient and comparable excision results between
groups. Although there was a significant difference in
omentectomy rates among treatment groups, 88% of
patients with recurrence underwent an omentectomy.
Furthermore, Gehrig and colleagues suggested that
the sensitivity of a visually negative omentum was 0.89
(P < .0001); therefore, an omentum without gross metastases does not necessarily require removal, as it is unlikely
to impact clinical outcome.12
What remains difficult to quantify is the margin of
benefit adjuvant modalities have in reducing recurrence
risks in women with UPSC. Further insight into the
potential for benefit of an adjuvant therapeutic intervention may be gained through a better understanding of
stage-specific recurrence risks as well as patterns of recurrence. Published recurrence rates for untreated stage I
patients (0%-77%) vary considerably, thus complicating
risk assessment.6-9,13-17 Our study may represent a more

accurate report on patterns of recurrence, as we examined
a considerably larger number of comprehensively staged
patients from several academic institutions than reported
in recent series. In our series, untreated stage I patients (n
¼ 33) had a recurrence risk of 30.3%. When considering
untreated stage IA patients (n ¼ 19), we observed a
slightly higher recurrence rate than that reported in most
recent series (15.8%, Table 4). Several of these studies
suggest that observation be considered for women with
well-staged IA disease.8,17,18 However, in our study, 2/3
2124

recurrences in untreated stage IA patients were extrapelvic
and not salvageable. Other studies have attempted to
stratify consideration of observation of surgical stage IA
UPSC patients based on residual uterine disease status or
disease confined to an endometrial polyp.7,19 In these series, no recurrences were noted in 12 patients with stage
IA disease without residual UPSC who were observed
postsurgery or in 22 patients with disease confined to a
polyp. In our study, 3/19 (15.8%) stage IA patients had
no residual uterine disease; none experienced a recurrence.
However, 19 patients (37.3% of stage IA patients) had
polyp-confined UPSC, and 1 such patient experienced a
recurrence—a noncurable extrapelvic relapse. On the basis of the relapse rates noted in all substages of UPSC in
our cohort, consideration of adjuvant CT  RT seems
justifiable for all patients with stage IA or greater. Patients
with disease confined to a polyp or without residual uterine disease should be counseled that the risk of recurrence
is low but not negligible, and that relapses may be aggressive and not curable.
In regard to treatment of women with stage IB/IC
disease, we demonstrated that the margin of benefit of systemic adjuvant therapy appears to be greater for these
patients than for stage IA patients. Recurrence patterns for
IB/IC patients in this series were similar to those observed
in recent, smaller reports of surgical stage I UPSC patients

(Table 4). When examined cumulatively, these studies
demonstrate a reduction in recurrences for CT  RT–
treated patients when compared with patients treated by
OBS or RT alone.
What remains most unclear is whether the addition
of RT to a platinum/taxane–based regimen improves clinical outcomes for patients. Our study demonstrates that
when RT is used as either the sole adjuvant modality or in
concert with CT, it may improve locoregional control.
However, primary relapses in UPSC occur most often
outside of the pelvis, and improved pelvic control with
RT did not necessarily translate into better extrapelvic
control. In a subgroup analysis of the 89 CT-treated
patients, there were no recurrence or survival benefits
observed with the addition of RT. However, when examining the CT-treated patients who experienced locoregional recurrence (n ¼ 4), our data suggest that improved
systemic and locoregional control may be achieved if CT
and RT are both used. These results should be viewed
with caution (as we were not powered to observe differences between patients who received CT alone vs CT þ
RT), but are in line with the results of a randomized,
phase 3 Nordic Society of Gynecologic Oncology/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
trial on adjuvant treatment with pelvic radiation  CT in
high-risk endometrial cancer.20 Although only 19% of
the enrolled 382 stage I-IIIA patients in this study had
UPSC, a significant difference in PFS and overall survival
(OS) was noted in the radiation þ CT treatment arm for
all histologic subtypes. These preliminary, unpublished
results are promising, and will likely impact the design of
future treatment trials for early stage UPSC.
Most studies on platinum-based treatment of early
stage UPSC are small, but demonstrate favorable outcomes.6-8,14,15,21,22 In 10 stage I patients treated with surgery and postoperative pelvic radiation therapy followed
by 4 cycles of cisplatin and epirubicin, all women were disease-free at 32 months, compared with their historical controls (where 53% were dead of disease at 38 months).14
Moreover, in a recent phase 2 study, 30 women with surgical stage I-IV UPSC were treated with a ‘‘sandwich’’ regimen using 3 cycles of either cisplatin or carboplatin plus
paclitaxel followed by pelvic RT (45 grays) and then
another 3 cycles of CT.22 The regimen was well tolerated,
and 3-year PFS and OS were 69% and 75%, respectively,
in 18/30 women with stage I/II disease.

A study strength is that only platinum/taxane regimens were included, and 97% of patients received carboplatin and paclitaxel. Adding taxanes to a platinum-based
regimen is reasonable, as taxanes appear to have good activity in UPSC as well as endometrioid adenocarcinoma.9,10 In a retrospective, multi-institutional study of
29 surgical stage I UPSC patients, 21 women treated with
paclitaxel and carboplatin were alive and had no evidence
of disease, compared with only 6/8 patients who received
cisplatin with or without cyclophosphamide, or carboplatin alone.15
Our study has several limitations inherent to its
retrospective design. The treatment groups were not
matched for all variables, including age. An increased
number of older women were treated with observation.
This may be a result of physician bias precluding adjuvant
treatment in elderly patients. However, although the OBS
group had the most recurrences, age did not ultimately
impact recurrence rates after multivariate analysis. A second limitation was the inclusion of patients treated with a
variety of RT regimens. However, most patients received
whole pelvic RT  brachytherapy. Despite acquiring data
from 9 academic institutions, we report on a small number of patients treated by RT alone (n ¼ 20). This may
reflect a physician bias at academic centers for administering systemic therapy to these patients—a bias that seems
to be supported by our data. Our median follow-up time
of only 37 months was also not optimal; however, followup times were similar between adjuvant treatment groups,
and the vast majority of recurrences in this series (72%)
happened during the first 2 years after diagnosis (with
95% occurring within 3 years). This is in line with data in
type I endometrial cancer demonstrating that most recurrences develop within 2 to 3 years of diagnosis. Hence,
follow-up time was adequate to assess recurrence patterns,
which was 1 of our primary objectives.
High rates of recurrence in women with stage I uterine papillary serous carcinoma, regardless of substage, justify a consideration for adjuvant therapies. Although the
best adjuvant strategy for women with early stage UPSC
remains uncertain, we provide compelling data that
surgically staged patients treated with platinum/taxane
regimens experience low recurrence rates and overall
favorable prognoses. The relative benefit of RT in the
treatment of this disease remains unclear. Although only
randomized controlled trials or larger prospective cohort
2126

studies will allow us to refine our understanding of the
optimal adjuvant regimen and its associated margin of
benefit for each substage of UPSC, it is clear from these
data that platinum/taxane regimens merit further study. A
multi-institutional or cooperative group phase 3 study
examining platinum/taxane–based treatment with and
without RT is a reasonable next step in furthering our
understanding of early stage UPSC management.
