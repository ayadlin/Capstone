ABSTRACT
Peptide hormone-based targeted therapy to tumors has been studied extensively.
Our previous study shows that somatostatin receptor expresses high level on drugresistant human ovarian cancer. The paclitaxel-octreotide conjugate (POC) exhibits
enhanced growth inhibition, as well as reduced toxicity, in paclitaxel-resistant
human ovarian cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
targeted cytotoxicity and potential reversal mechanism of resistance in paclitaxelresistant human ovarian cancer cells xenografted into nude mice. The SSTR2 shows
higher expression levels in tumor tissue. Moreover, fluorescein-labeled POC displays
favorable targeting in tumor cells. POC presents the perfect efficacy in inhibiting tumor
growth and exerts lower or no toxic effects on normal tissues. Real-time PCR and
Western Blotting has demonstrated that the mRNA and protein expressions of SSTR2
in POC group were significantly higher, while MDR1, a-tubulin, βIII-tubulin, VEGF
and MMP-9 were significantly lower than in the other treatment groups and controls.
Combined with the previous study in vitro, this study evaluates an effective approach
on the treatment of paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer which expresses somatostatin
receptor SSTR. Our investigation has also revealed the possible molecular mechanism
of POC in treating the ovarian cancer, and therefore, provided a theoretical basis for
the clinical application of this newly-invented compound.

new anticancer drugs and reversing drug resistance are
particularly important.
Natural somatostatin (SST), also known as
somatotropin release-inhibiting factor (SRIF), is a cyclic
peptide, with a wide range of cellular functions, such as
inhibiting the secretion of various hormones, blocking
cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. As one of
the short peptides, somatostatin is an optional agent in
receptor targeting radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This
is based on its ease of synthesis and optimization, which
relatively small molecular weight, fast cycling clearance,
and good tissue penetration ability [6–8]. The biological
effects of somatostatin are mediated by targeting the
five somatostatin receptors (SSTR) expressed on cell
membranes [9–10]. Somatostatin receptors, which are
a group of mediators for somatostatin function, are

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of deaths
among female gynecological malignancies. Due to the
indolence at the early stage and lack of early diagnostic
methods, approximately 70% of patients are diagnosed
at advanced stage (stage III and IV) [1–2]. Cytoreductive
surgery, followed by systematic chemotherapy of platinum
and paclitaxel, is adapted as the standard treatment for
advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. Even though the
treatment is initially effective to 80% patients, recurrent
cancer with paclitaxel resistance is inevitable in many
cases, resulting in subsequent failure of chemotherapy
[3–4]. Moreover, available evidence indicates that the
effect of second-line chemotherapy is compromised due
to heterogeneity in populations [5]. Therefore, exploring

distributed extensively in neuroendocrine tumors as well
as carcinomas such as breast cancer, colon cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and cervical cancer
[11–12]. These observations raise the possibility of SST
and its analogue as potential tumor therapeutic molecules.
Compared to natural somatostatin, synthetic somatostatin
analogues (SSTA) like lanreotide, octreotide and
vapreotide show more advantages including longer halflife, metabolic stability, more specificity and efficiency
[13–15]. Studies have shown that SSTAs not only inhibit
tumor cell proliferation in vitro, but also suppress the
growth of solid tumors in vivo.
One of the five somatostatin receptors, SSTR2, can
be detected to be expressed in tumor, and SSTA has much
higher binding affinity to SSTR2 in tumor tissues than in
normal tissues [16–17]. SSTR2 can mediate the biological
effects of somatostatin as the latter can block the cell
proliferation, promote apoptosis and inhibit the secretion
of various hormones [9–10]. Furthermore, recent studies
have found that the expression of SSTR2 in ovarian
cancer tissue is quite high and SSTA has the capacity to
inhibit and reverse paclitaxel resistance from multiple
pathways [18–24]. Some researchers conjugated SSTA
(RC121, RC160) with paclitaxel into different targeted
drugs and found that the conjugate increased intracellular
concentration of paclitaxel, which was cytotoxic to breast
cancer cells and its stem cells [25].
Octreotide (OCT) is the most widely applied
representative of SSTA, and can inhibit the growth of
various carcinomas including gastrointestinal tumors,
breast cancer, besides neuroendocrine tumors and
leukemia, through targeted binding to somatostatin
receptor on tumor cells [26–28]. OCT also displays a
high affinity for SSTR2, induces the activation of tyrosine
phosphatase and inhibits the proliferation of SSTR2
expressing cells [29]. Our previous studies confirmed that
OCT, in combination with cisplatin, can effectively inhibit
the growth of SKOV3/DDP cisplatin-resistant human
ovarian cancer, promote its apoptosis and reverse its
resistance to cisplatin [30–31]. We have also detected that
A2780/Taxol paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian cancer
cell expresses SSTR2 and therefore, the synthetic POC
could exert its functions in a dose and time-dependent
manner via its specific binding to cell surface [32].
Some other studies indicate that chemotherapy
based on SSTR-targeting has higher efficiency and lower
toxicity in comparison to traditional chemotherapy. Some
scholars conjugated doxorubicin or gemcitabine with
SSTA and discovered that the conjugates had cytotoxic
effect specifically on tumor tissues which express SSTR
but lower toxicity to normal tissues in animal models.
Furthermore, even in tumors with relatively low densities
of SSTR expression, the conjugates are more effective and
less toxic [33–35].
Based on the previous findings, this study aims
to investigate the targeted effectiveness of POC and its

mechanism on reversing the resistance of paclitaxel in
A2780/Taxol ovarian cancer xenografted in the animal
model.

RESULTS
Inhibition of tumor growth
All the xenografted tumors grew up to about 1cm3
in size after 10 days following subcutaneous injection
of A2780/Taxol ovarian cancer cells. At this time,
no symptoms of apathy, diarrhea or poor vitality was
observed in all the tested mice. After four weeks following
the first administration, the average tumor weight and
size in any treatment group were significantly lower than
those in the control group (P <0.05). In comparison with
the octreotide group and paclitaxel group, the average
weight and size of tumor in PO group (0.86 gm, 1.12 cm3)
were even lower and smaller (P<0.05). In addition, POC
presented the perfect efficacy in tumor growth inhibition
with a significantly decreased average weight and size
of tumor (0.59 gm, 0.64 cm3) than any other treatments
(P<0.05; Table 1, Figure 1).

Targeting ability of POC in vivo
When the xenografted tumor grew up to about
1cm3, intravenous injection of fluorescence labeled
paclitaxel-octreotide conjugate (FITC-POC) was
performed in selected nude mice. 30 minutes after the
administration, the fluorescent signals were initially
observed in tumor site, and the fluorescence intensity was
gradually increased during the prolonged observation
(Figure 2A). A significant aggregation of fluorescence
into the xenografted tumor at 8 hours reaching the peak
at 24 hours indicated a favorable targeting of POC. After
administration for 72hours, part of the fluorescence was
still visible within the tumor site. Besides, mild fluorescent
signals could be found aggregated in liver and kidney
at each time point. These findings suggested that POC
presented specific targeting to paclitaxel-resistant human
ovarian cancer cells in nude mice and was probably
metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.

Histology and SSTR2 expression in xenografted
tumor
The tumors showed the same morphology as the
original serous ovarian cancer by using HE stain. POC
group and PO group displayed more necrosis of tumor
tissues than paclitaxel group and octreotide group
(Figure 3A). In addition, these morphology effects of
chemotherapy were not observed in the non-targeted
organs, such as liver, kidney, spleen and the tails of the
treated mice (Supplemental figure 2). Therefore, it is
suggested POC had lower or no toxicity to tissues outside

octreotide, has a longer half-life than native somatostatin,
and is effective in inhibition of multiple tumors such as
neuroendocrine tumors, gastrointestinal cancer, breast
cancer and leukemia [26–28].
Our previous study in vitro using the human ovarian
cancer cell line found that paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells
express high levels of SSTR2, and POC treatment could
lead to more cell apoptosis when compared to cells treated
with paclitaxel alone. Underlying cause for the difference
is possibly the specific targeting of octreotide to SSTR2,
which is distributed at high density on tumor cell surface
[32]. Here we reported the first in vivo study using the
nude mice. As in previous study, the high level expression
of SSTR2 in xenografted paclitaxel-resistant ovarian
tumor was confirmed by IHC, RT-PCR and western blot.
Previous in vitro research found that POC reversed
chemotherapy paclitaxel-resistance through reducing
the protein levels of SSTR2. However, the in vivo
results represented in this article suggested that SSTR2
expression in POC treatment was significantly higher than
in other treatment at both mRNA and protein levels. These
observations may indicate that the reversal effect of POC
might be associated with the increased the expression
of SSTR2. The discrepancy of SSTR2 observed in Hua
group between short-term and long-term treatment of
Hepatocellular carcinoma using octreotide can explain the
different SSTR2 expression levels in our in vivo and in
vitro studies. This discrepancy could have resulted from
the desensitization and internalization of SSTR2 after
short-term octreotide application, and may be related to
drug concentration, treatment time and microenvironment
[37].
In vivo imaging results further showed that POC
could combine with xenografted tumor specifically and
POC was accumulated in tumor significantly during

Western blotting was applied to determine the
protein expression levels of SSTR2, MDR1, VEGF,
MMP-9, α-tubulin and βIII-tubulin after each treatment.
The protein level of SSTR2 was in accordance with the
mRNA expression. Namely, SSTR2 protein expressions
in all treatment groups were higher than in the control
group and POC group was significantly higher than the
other treatment groups. Furthermore, MDR1, VEGF,
MMP-9, α-tubulin and βIII-tubulin protein expressions
in each treatment group were lower in comparison with
those in the control group, and levels of POC group were
significantly lower than those from the other treatment
groups (P <0.05). It is worth noting that, the protein
expression levels of MDR1, VEGF, MMP-9 in octreotide
group were lower than those in paclitaxel group, and
α-tubulin, βIII-tubulin were still higher than paclitaxel
group. The differences between each group were
statistically significant (P <0.05, Figure 5).

DISCUSSION
Chemotherapeutic regimens based on paclitaxel and
platinum combination are currently used for the treatment
of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. However,
due to the emergence of drug resistance, tumor relapse
happens even with chemotherapy and usually leads to
treatment failure. More investigations thus emphasize
on the paclitaxel resistance and the development of new
therapeutic agents that can overcome this resistance.
Peptide receptors are potential targets for the
molecular therapies, as represented by somatostatin
receptor [36]. The synthetic somatostatin analogue,

the prolonged observation in 24 hours. However, other
organs such as the liver and the kidneys have no obvious
uptake of POC. The inhomogeneous POC distribution
indicated that POC can specifically target at paclitaxelresistant human ovarian cancer cells in nude mice. In
addition, the tumor weight and size of POC treatment were
significantly lower than those in the other treatment group.
Histologic examination also revealed that the degree of
tumor necrosis and chemotherapy morphologic changes
was more significant in POC group. A large lightly stained
area with unclear boundary was surrounded by different
amount of inflammatory cell infiltration and irregularly
divided tumor cells. However, other organs showed no
remarkable pathological changes. In line with our previous
studies, these results further illustrated that POC could not
only inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro, but
also reverse the resistance of human ovarian cancer cell
to paclitaxel and induce the better chemotherapy response
of solid tumors in vivo. These therapeutic effects were
even further optimized as reduced cytotoxicity of POC to
SSTR-negative cells was observed simultaneously.
Multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) is known
as one of the important mechanisms causing paclitaxel
resistance. Overexpression of MDR1 leads to membrane
p-glycoprotein (p-gp) overexpression, which could
decrease the intracellular paclitaxel concentration, and
results in the reduced inhibitory effect on tumor cells by
paclitaxel [31–42]. Studies have shown that, SSTA can
suppress MDR1 expression and reverse drug resistance
by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signal pathway when binding
to SSTR1A, SSTRR1B and SSTR2 [21]. In our study,
POC treatment significantly decreased the mRNA and
protein expressions of MDR1 if compared with other
treatment group which was consistent with our previous
study in vitro. Furthermore, the MDR1 expression
was lower in mRNA and protein levels by octreotide
treatment than paclitaxel treatment. In combination, these
results suggested that the reversal mechanism of POC
to paclitaxel-resistance in human ovarian cancer was
possibly by reducing MDR1 expression.
Another mechanism of paclitaxel resistance may
be related to abnormal expression of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGFA, VEGF), a growth factor promoting
angiogenesis and playing the critical role in tumor
expansion [43]. The VEGF released by tumor tissues
leads to an upregulation of MDR1 through VEGF-VEGFR
signal pathway, and VEGFR antagonist can significantly
inhibit the ability of drug resistance and invasion of tumors
[44, 45]. Studies have demonstrated that the microvascular
endothelial cells of tumor tissues sometimes express
SSTR and somatostatin. These expressions could induce
vasoconstriction and consequently cause circulatory
disturbance to inhibit tumor growth [22–23]. This
study showed that both mRNA and protein expression
of VEGF after POC treatment were down-regulated,
which was consistent with the result in vitro [32]. In
addition, octreotide treatment led to a lower mRNA and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

protein expressions of VEGF in comparison to paclitaxel
treatment. The down-regulating of VEGF expression was
probably the reversal mechanisms mediated by POC.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are demanding
molecules in tumor cell invasion by degrading
extracellular matrix (ECM). MMP-2 and -9 are
particularly associated with the invasion of multiple
gynecological maliginancies, such as cervical cancer,
endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer [46]. Bergers
found that MMP-9 could promote tumor angiogenesis
by increasing the expression of VEGF and its receptor
(VEGFR) [47]. When angiogenesis was inhibited, MMP2 and -9 expressions are up-regulated. Inhibitors of MMPs
can weaken the MMPs roles in regulation of angiogenesis
by decreasing MMP-9 expression, and consequently
the inhibition of tumor growth. Some other studies
also revealed that up-regulation of MMP-9 expression
enhanced the chemotherapeutic resistance, and SSTR2
could suppress tumor growth and metastasis by inhibition
of MMP-2 and -9 expressions indirectly [24, 48]. Here
we found that MMP-9 mRNA and protein expressions
in tumor tissues were significantly decreased following
POC treatment as compared to the other treatment and
control group. Interestingly, the mRNA and protein levels
of MMP-9 by octreotide treatment alone were both lower
than by paclitaxel treatment alone. In summary, these
findings suggested that POC reversal of the resistance of
paclitaxel probably by inhibiting MMP-9 expressions in
both mRNA and protein levels, and it seems that octreotide
maybe more relevant to regulate the MMPs.
The anti-tumor activity of paclitaxel relies on its
capability of stabilizing microtubules and the resultant
interference with the G2-M transition of the cell cycle
[49–50]. Thus, the altered structure of microtubules is
one of the reasons for paclitaxel resistance. Fluctuation
of microtubule composition expression may lead to
dynamic changes in microtubule and eventually alter the
tumor response to paclitaxel. The increased expression
levels of α-tubulin and βIII-tubulin, mutation of βItubulin or down-regulation of microtubule associated
proteins (MAPs) can undermine the inherent stability of
microtubules and reduce the efficacy of paclitaxel [51–52].
In this study, decreased mRNA and protein expressions
of α-tubulin and βIII-tubulin in tumor tissues were
detected in each treatment group except the control group.
Octreotide treatment showed higher α-tubulin and βIIItubulin expression in both mRNA and protein levels than
paclitaxel treatment, which was higher than octreotide
combined with paclitaxel treatment. Additionally, POC
treatment had the lowest expressions of α-tubulin and
βIII-tubulin in all experimental groups. The alteration
of tubulin expression levels may be explained by POC
increasing the intracellular concentration of paclitaxel
through specifically targeting octreotide on cell membrane
followed by endocytosis. The endocytosis of the conjugate
then concentrates the intracellular paclitaxel and promotes
its inhibitory effect on α-tubulin and βIII-tubulin.

Paclitaxel-octreotide conjugate presents better
effects on targeting and inhibiting paclitaxel-resistant
human ovarian cancer cells in nude mice. The inhibition
of POC on tumors could probably result from a series of
mechanisms, including specific binding of octreotide to the
membrance receptor of SSTR2, up-regulated expression of
SSTR2 as well as down-regulated expressions of MDR1,
α-tubulin, βIII-tubulin, VEGF and MMP-9.

with octreotide (150 nmol/kg), paclitaxel-octreotide
conjugate (150 nmol/kg) or saline only were intravenously
administrated on days 1,8 and 15. Four weeks after the
first administration, the mice were sacrificed to measure
the size of tumors according to Steel formula tumor
volume: V = ab2/2 (cm3) (a: short-track; b: long-track).
The tumors were weighed in grams after stripping out the
tumors, removing adjacent non-tumor soft tissue. Then the
inhibitory rate of each drugs were calculated as follows:
inhibitory rate = (Vcontrol group -Vexperimental group)/Vcontrol group ×
100 %.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peptide and chemicals
Paclitaxel (Taiji Pharmaceutical Co.Ltd., China)
– octreotide (Zineng Pharmaceutical Co.Ltd., China)
conjugate was synthesized in our lab, using the following
steps: (1) Preparation of SDPP (N-Hydroxysuccinimido
diphenyl phosphate) and paclitaxel 2’ -succinate. (2)
Synthesis of paclitaxel 2’-succinyl-NHS by the reaction
of paclitaxel 2’-succinate with SDPP. (3) Paclitaxel
- octreotide conjugate was obtained by the coupling
reaction of paclitaxel 2’-succinyl-NHS with octreotide.
The structure of paclitaxel - octreotide conjugate was
confirmed by ESI-MS (as shown in supplemental figure
1). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Sigma Chemical
Co.St.Louis, MO, USA) was labeled to paclitaxel octreotide conjugate by our laboratory.

Targeting ability studies

Cell culture

To perform pathological examination, the tumor
tissue of mice in each treated group was fixed with 4%
formaldehyde solution, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin
and cut into 5μm-thick serial sections. Selected sections
were then stained with hematoxylin–eosin staining (HE
stain). Morphological changes of tumor tissues and nontargeted organs were observed under light microscope and
confocal microscope (Olympus FluoView ™ FV1000,
Japan). The primary rabbit anti-mouse SSTR2 monoclonal
antibody (ab134152, diluted 1:100; Abcam) was used
to investigate whether SSTR2 was expressed in tumor
tissues.

To evaluate the targeting ability of POC, we used
nude mice with the tumor size larger than 1cm3 for the
imaging experiments. The mice were intravenously
injected with fluorescein-labeled paclitaxel-octreotide
conjugate (FITC-POC) (150 nmol/kg). After being
anesthetized with isoflurane (2-3% concentration), all
mice were observed by using the automated small-animal
in vivo imaging systems (Maestro™ Automated In-Vivo
Imaging, USA) at multiple time points (0.5 and 8, 24 and
72hours).

Histopathology and immunohistochemistry assay

Paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line
A2780/Taxol (BogooBioTECH, Co.Ltd., China) was
cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco BRL Co.Ltd.,
USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen,
USA) at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 90% humidity.
The log-phase cells were collected by using 0.25% trypsin
(Gibco BRL Co.Ltd., USA) and then xenografted into
nude mice simultaneously.

Animals and xenografts

Quantitative realtime-PCR and western blot
analysis

Female athymic nude mice (BALB/c-nu/nu)
(Experimental Animal Center of Chinese Academy of
Science), approximately 6-8 weeks old and weighing
18-20g were breeding in specific-pathogen-free (SPF)
conditions. Xenograft models were established by
subcutaneous injection of 5×106 A2780/Taxol ovarian
cancer cells into the right armpit of forty nude mice, and
mice behavior and tumor growth were observed daily.
All animal experiments were approved by Experimental
Animal Ethics Committee of Southeast University.

The tumor tissues were cut into small pieces and
homogenized into powder in Trizol reagent until the
slurry was without transparent particles (100 mg: 1ml).
The cell lysate was transferred into a centrifuge tube and
placed at room temperature for 5min. After centrifuging
at 12,000rpm, at 4°C for 10min, supernatant was carefully
transferred into a new centrifuge tube. The mRNA and
protein expressions of MDR1/p-gp, α-tubulin, βIII-tubulin,
VEGF and MMP-9 were detected as described in manual
from RT-PCR kit (Takara Biotechnology Co.Ltd., Dalian,
China) and BeyoECL star (Beyotime Biotechnology,
