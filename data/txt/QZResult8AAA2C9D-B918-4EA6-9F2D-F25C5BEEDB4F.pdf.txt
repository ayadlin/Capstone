BACKGROUND: As Ewing sarcoma (EWS) can affect children and adults, these patients can be treated at either a pediatric or an adult institution. This study investigated whether differences in therapeutic strategy undertaken in pediatric and adult specialty sarcoma centers correlated with clinical outcome. METHODS: Data from patients with
localized EWS treated between 1990 and 2005 at tertiary care pediatric and adult institutions were reviewed.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (24 adult and 29 pediatric) were treated. Pediatric patients received a median of 16
cycles of chemotherapy comprised of doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide. Adult
patients received a median of 10 cycles of treatment, and a significantly lower total cumulative dose of ifosfamide
and cyclophosphamide (P < .0001). There was no difference noted with regard to the total dose of doxorubicin, or in
the type of local therapy offered (surgery or radiotherapy, vs both). However, local therapy occurred earlier in pediatric patients compared with adults (3.7 months vs 7.4 months; P ¼.0003). The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rate in
pediatric and adult patients was 70%  9% and 43%  13% (P ¼ 0.1), respectively. The 3-year overall survival rate was
81%  7.7% and 59%  12% (P ¼.02) for pediatric and adult patients, respectively. Factors found to be significantly
associated with EFS on univariate analysis included pelvic site, cyclophosphamide dose, and time to local therapy.
On multivariate analysis, only pelvic disease (hazard ratio [HR] 4.26; P ¼.018) and time to local therapy (HR, 1.19;
P ¼.002) were found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with localized EWS have an inferior outcome compared with pediatric patients. This difference may be related to lower doses of alkylating agents and the timing of

KEYWORDS: Ewing sarcoma, chemotherapy, adult, pediatric, radiotherapy.

The Ewing family of tumors are comprised of Ewing sarcoma (EWS), extraskeletal EWS, and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of bone, soft tissue, and the chest wall (Askin tumor). EWS is the second most common primary bone
malignancy in childhood and adolescence, with a yearly frequency in the population younger than 20 years of approximately 2.9 per million.1 The peak age for EWS is 15 to 17 years,2 and consequently, patients with this tumor are often
seen at both adult and pediatric institutions.
The impact of age on the prognosis of EWS remains controversial. In certain series, older age has been associated
with an inferior clinical outcome,3-6 yet others have been unable to demonstrate a significant difference based on age
alone.7-9 The impact of age can be confounded by a greater proportion of large pelvic primary tumors and more advanced
disease in adult patients,4 although other specific biological differences based on age may also play a role. To our knowledge, there have been no studies to date to systematically document treatment differences between adult and pediatric centers to account for differences in outcome.
The approach to therapy for pediatric patients is driven by clinical trial-based protocols, whereas adult treatment is
often institution-specific. Some adult centers follow pediatric protocols, whereas concerns regarding tolerance to therapy

have influenced other centers that treat adults to modify
their regimens to better suit this older population. Thus,
the ideal treatment strategy for adults with EWS remains
undefined, and the lack of clinical trials available through
adult cooperative groups for newly diagnosed patients
contributes to heterogeneity in treatment.
The University of Toronto has a large tertiary care
pediatric oncology program and a separate tertiary referral
center for adult sarcoma. Differences in therapeutic strategy used at these institutions provide an opportunity for
comparative analysis. We sought to compare the treatment-related factors that impacted outcome in patients
with localized EWS, adjusting for age.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
After Research Ethics Board approval was obtained from
The Hospital for Sick Children (Sickkids) and Mount
Sinai Hospital (MSH), hospital records of patients with
newly diagnosed localized EWS from 1990 to 2005 were
retrospectively reviewed. Patients with recurrent or metastatic disease at presentation or those who did not receive
all systemic therapy at these institutions were excluded.
Information regarding tumor site, stage, chemotherapy
drugs and doses, timing of chemotherapy, type and timing of local therapy (radiotherapy [RT] or surgery), and
outcome was recorded. Data on tumor size were not uniformly available.
Data were collected for 29 patients from Sickkids
(pediatric) and 24 patients from MSH (adult). At both
centers, initial staging investigations included computed
tomography (CT) scan of the chest, technetium-99 total
body bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
the primary tumor, and bilateral bone marrow aspirations
and biopsies. The chemotherapy agents and doses used
for all patients at both hospitals included vincristine (maximum dose 2 mg), doxorubicin (75 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (1.2 g/m2) [VDC] alternating with etoposide
(100 mg/m2  5 days) and ifosfamide (1.8 g/m2/day 
5 days) [IE] every 3 weeks. At Sickkids, before 1996,
patients were treated with the intent of receiving 10 cycles
of chemotherapy (5 cycles of VDC and 5 cycles of IE),
with local therapy planned after cycle 4 (n ¼ 4). From
1996 onward, patients at Sickkids were treated according
to the Intergroup Study 0154, through the Children’s
Oncology Group (COG).10 The standard arm of this
study included 5 cycles of VDC and 4 cycles of VC alternating with IE (8 cycles), for a total planned 17 cycles and
the investigational arm contained dose-intense alkylating

3190

agent for a total of 11 cycles. Local treatment was planned
after 12 weeks of therapy on both arms.10 Three patients
from Sickkids were registered on this study: 1 on the
standard arm and 2 on the investigational arm. After closure of the study, all patients were treated per the standard
arm with 17 cycles of therapy. There were no clinical trials
open at MSH for patients with newly diagnosed EWS
during the study period, and no patients at MSH were
registered on COG studies. All MSH patients were
treated with VDC (total of 5 cycles) alternating with IE
(total of 5 cycles), for a total of 10 planned cycles of therapy, regardless of age. The timing of local therapy was at
the discretion of the multidisciplinary treating team. Information regarding treatment at recurrence was not
collected.
At both institutions, local treatment was by surgical
resection by orthopedic oncologists whenever possible,
with radiotherapy reserved for lesions deemed to be unresectable, or for patients with microscopic residual disease
after surgery. At Sickkids, RT was delivered as previously
described.6 At MSH, patients who received RT alone
received 5000 centigrays (cGy) in 25 fractions to the
entire medullary cavity to cover MRI bone marrow
changes plus a 2-cm margin, followed by a boost to 6000
to 6600 cGy in 30 to 33 fractions. Similarly, patients with
microscopic residual disease postoperatively received
5000 cGy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed plus a 5-cm
margin, and a boost to tumor bed plus 2-cm margin to a
maximum of 6600 cGy in 33 fractions.
The date of local treatment was defined as the date
of definitive surgery or RT. If a patient received both
modalities of treatment, the date of local control was
defined by whichever occurred first. Time to local therapy
was defined as the time from the initiation of chemotherapy to local treatment. Progressive disease was defined as
evidence of new disease or documented radiologic progression during or up to 3 months after completion of all
therapy. Recurrence was defined as any evidence of new
disease >3 months after the completion of therapy. Dose
intensity of doxorubicin chemotherapy was calculated as
total dose of doxorubicin/(date of last cycle of
doxorubicin þ 21 days  date chemotherapy started)/7,
as previously described.11 Similar calculations were performed for cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide.
Statistical Analysis
Medians and means were used to estimate central values
of the variables considered. Ranges and standard deviations were used to estimate the spread of the data. For the

comparison of medians, the median test was used. Chisquare tests were used to assess cross-classification of categorical variables. Survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to death or last patient follow-up. Kaplan-Meier
survival curves were used to estimate proportion surviving
and the log-rank test was used to compare subgroups. For
univariate and multiple regression, Cox proportional hazards were used. If variables were significant at the .025 level
on univariate analysis, then they were included in the multiple regression. All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The demographics and clinical characteristics of the 53
evaluable patients are depicted in Table 1. The median
age for the 29 pediatric patients was 13.4 years (range,
0.29-16.2 years), and was 26.1 years for the 24 adult
patients (range, 16.7-66.5 years). There were 2 patients
aged <18 years who were treated at the adult hospital, but
they were considered adults for the purpose of this report.
Two pediatric (6.9%) and 6 adult (25%) patients had primary pelvic disease (P ¼ .07).

Chemotherapy
All patients received chemotherapy. For patients who
completed planned therapy (ie, excluding those who experienced disease progression while receiving therapy), the median number of cycles of therapy was 16 and 10, respectively,
for pediatric and adult patients (P <.0001). Correspondingly, the median total dose of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide was higher in pediatric than adult patients (Table 1).
The median dose of doxorubicin delivered was similar
among pediatric and adult patients; however, the dose intensity of doxorubicin was higher in adult patients compared
with pediatric patients (P ¼ .0001). There was no difference
in dose intensity of ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide between
pediatric and adult patients. Pediatric patients who received
RT at Week 12 would have had an interruption in the delivery of doxorubicin. Dose intensity of doxorubicin did not
differ between pediatric and adult patients who received surgery alone for local control (data not shown).
Local Therapy
The form of local therapy used did not differ between pediatric and adult patients (P ¼ .36); 16 of 29 (55%) pediatric patients and 11 of 24 (46%) adult patients
underwent surgery only; 3 of 29 (10%) and 6 of 24

and 10 of 29 (35%) and 7 of 24 (29%), respectively,
received RT only. The median dose of RT was 4500
centi-Gray (cGy) (range, 4500-6940 cGy) and 60 Gy
(range, 5000-6600 cGy) in pediatric and adult patients,
respectively. None of the patients required amputation.
The time to local therapy was shorter in pediatric patients
compared with all adult patients (3.7 months vs 7.4
months; P ¼ .0003) and compared with adults with nonpelvic primary tumors (3.7 months vs 6.0 months;
P ¼ .003).
Survival
The median follow-up time for surviving patients (n ¼
37) was 3.9 years (range, 0.67-10.1 years). The estimated
3-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)
rates for all patients are listed in Table 2. After treatment
for localized disease in pediatric and adult patients, the
3-year EFS rate was 70%  9% and 43%  13% (P ¼ .1)
and the OS rate was 81%  7.7% and 59%  12%
(P ¼ .02), respectively. Nine of 29 (31%) pediatric
patients experienced an event (recurrent or progressive
disease [PD]), 3 of whom (33%) were alive in second
remission at a median follow-up of 3.4 years (range, 2.16.36 years). In comparison, 10 of 24 (42%) adult patients
developed disease recurrence or had PD, and all had died
at the time of last follow-up. The median time to disease
recurrence/PD was 1.59 years and 1.43 years, respectively,
in pediatric and adult patients. The estimated 3-year OS
and EFS rates for all patients are listed in Table 2. In
patients with disease recurrence/PD, the median time to
local therapy was 6.2 months (range, 2-21 months) compared with 3.75 months (range, 3.75-9.07 months) in
31 patients without disease recurrence/PD.

pelvic tumor site (HR, 4.26; P ¼ .018) and time to local
therapy (HR, 1.19; P ¼ .002) were found to be significant
predictors of EFS (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
We compared the treatment-related factors that affected
outcome of localized EWS in adult and pediatric patients
treated at 2 tertiary care institutions. The major advantage
of this study was the homogeneity in chemotherapy delivered to the adult patients, because only 1 medical oncologist was involved over the study period. Furthermore,
both the pediatric and adult institutions are large tertiary
care centers with dedicated orthopedic, medical, and radiation oncologists with expertise in the management of sarcoma. The current study is subject to the inherent bias of
a retrospective chart review, with small numbers of
patients in 2 groups that were very different in their characteristics. Furthermore, specific limitations in data collection were encountered. Information regarding toxicities,
including febrile neutropenia, was not collected because
many patients were managed at local community hospitals
for these events. Unfortunately, tumor volume was also not
recorded due to the difficulty in locating the reports of initial MRI scans from patients treated in earlier years.
Adult patients received 5 cycles of IE alternating
with 5 cycles of VDC, resulting in a 3-year OS rate
of 59% for patients with localized disease. If patients
with pelvic primary tumors were excluded, OS improved

to 67%. The survival results in the current study compare
favorably with many previous reports of localized EWS in
adults treated with conventional chemotherapy, and a median age of >19 years with 3-year to 5-year OS rates of
40%,12 49%,13 52%,7 54%,8 59%,14 and 60%.15
The outcome of patients treated at the pediatric
institution in the current study was better than that of
patients treated at the adult institution. We compared the
treatment-related factors that may have contributed to
this difference, independent of age. Adults received fewer
cycles of chemotherapy compared with children, with a
consequential difference in the total dose of alkylating
agent. On univariate analysis, the total dose of cyclophosphamide significantly impacted EFS, whereas the total
dose of ifosfamide did not. The INT-0091 study6 demonstrated that the addition of IE improved survival in pediatric patients with localized EWS, but was not sufficiently
powered to determine if this was beneficial to patients
aged >18 years. Because there is no a priori reason to
expect different responses in young adults, inclusion of
these agents is reasonable. In the European cooperative
group study EICESS-92, in which 23% of patients were
ages 20-35 years, ifosfamide was not found to be superior
to cyclophosphamide in patients with localized disease of
<100 mL, and the improvement in EFS with the addition
of etoposide to ifosfamide-based therapy was not statistically significant in patients with large-volume disease.16
The treatment strategy in the current study of using
10 cycles of chemotherapy in adults offered an acceptable
outcome; however, it is conceivable that increasing the
dose of alkylating agents by increasing the total number of
cycles of chemotherapy may further improve survival.
Dose intensity of chemotherapy over time was not
found to significantly contribute to outcome in the current report. Recently, a randomized trial demonstrated
that increasing the dose intensity of chemotherapy by
increasing the total doses per cycle administered 3-weekly
did not improve survival in patients with localized
EWS.10 However, interval compression of chemotherapy
given twice-weekly improved EFS in patients less than age
18 from 65% to 76% (P ¼ .028).17 The inclusion of
adults with EWS in future studies is important to ensure
that trials are powered sufficiently to extrapolate conclusions to older patients.
On multivariate analysis, a longer time interval
between the initiation of treatment and definitive local
therapy unfavorably impacted EFS, adjusting for age.
Current pediatric protocols for EWS dictate that local
therapy should begin at 12 weeks from the initiation of

chemotherapy.6 By contrast, in adults, the timing of local
therapy is at the discretion of the multidisciplinary oncology team, and usually depends on tumor size, location,
and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As a result,
the decision as to when to offer local therapy for large pelvic tumors, often involves a detailed multidisciplinary
discussion among medical, radiation, and orthopedic
oncologists. In patients with chemo-responsive disease, it
is unclear whether the maximal benefit of chemotherapy
should be exploited to facilitate the best possible surgical
resection or radiation of the smallest tumor volume.
The delivery of concomitant RT and chemotherapy
is sometimes difficult in older patients, especially for axial
sites. Recovery from surgery for axial tumors is also often
prolonged, rendering it difficult to resume chemotherapy
in a timely manner. Furthermore, there may be merit in
maintaining dose intensity of chemotherapy in a patient
whose tumor is responding clinically. Such a response
might persuade clinicians to complete all 10 cycles, both
to avoid risking an interruption with local therapy as well
as to reduce total tumor volume. However, our data suggest that delaying local therapy may not be beneficial and
that it should be undertaken earlier in the treatment
course. In a study reviewing tolerance of chemotherapy in
older versus younger patients treated with the same chemotherapy regimen, older patients were more likely to have
grade 4 hematologic toxicity, compared with younger
patients; however, this did not translate into a difference
in frequency of dose delays or mean dose intensities.14 In
the current study, the dose intensity of doxorubicin was in
fact higher in adult patients than in pediatric patients, due
to the lack of interruption for RT. Adult patients treated
at MSH received higher doses and larger volume of RT
compared with pediatric patients treated at Sickkids,
mainly due to greater concern for recurrent disease and
less concern for growth-related complications and second
malignancies. Careful review of the toxicity experienced
by the adult population is warranted, and if feasible, earlier local therapy should be considered. It is conceivable
that a delay in local therapy will allow for the development
of resistant disease, although this has not been previously
systematically documented. However, a previous review
plotted the duration of chemotherapy before RT (in
patients who were treated with RT alone) against OS and
found that a significant association was identified between
a delay to RT and reduced survival.18
One of the strongest prognostic factors associated
with a poor outcome of patients with localized EWS is
primary disease in the pelvis. The increased prevalence of

3193

Original Article

pelvic EWS in adult patients is often cited as 1 of the main
contributors to poor outcome. The optimal strategy of
addressing local therapy in pelvic disease with surgery,
RT, or both, has been the subject of many reports, yet
remains highly controversial.19-22 Adults in the current
study were more likely to present with primary pelvic disease (6 of 24 patients vs 2 of 29 patients; P ¼ .07), and
also fared poorly. Our results suggest that introducing
local therapy earlier, even in patients with large pelvic primary disease, may improve outcome.
In summary, adults with localized EWS treated at
an adult institution can achieve reasonable outcomes,
although OS remains inferior to pediatric patients. There
may be value to offering local therapy earlier, and perhaps
revisiting the total dose of alkylating agents planned as
part of adult EWS chemotherapy regimens. For a disease
that is just as common in young adults as in children, a
concerted effort is required to capture these patients in
clinical trials to systematically address questions regarding
biological factors and therapeutic strategies to improve
survival. Future initiatives through the COG to bring trials in EWS to the clinical trials support unit (available at:
https://www.ctsu.org/) may provide a platform for adult
patients to access prospective studies.
