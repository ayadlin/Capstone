ABSTRACT
Galectin-1 (Gal-1), a member of the galectin family of carbohydrate binding
proteins, plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes of tumorigenesis. The
regulatory effect of Gal-1 on multidrug resistance (MDR) breast cancer cells is still
unclear. qRT-PCR and western blot showed that Gal-1 and MDR gene 1 (MDR1) were
both highly expressed in breast tumor tissues and cell lines. MTT assay and flow
cytometry revealed that Gal-1 knockdown improved sensitivity to paclitaxel (PTX) and
adriamycin (ADR) in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells via inhibition of cell viability
and promotion of cell apoptosis, while MDR1 overexpression weakened the sensitivity
to PTX and ADR induced by Gal-1 knockdown. Furthermore, the negative effects
of Gal-1 knockdown on sensitivity to PTX and ADR in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR
cells were revealed to be mediated via the suppression of Raf-1/AP-1 pathway. In
conclusion, Gal-1 knockdown dramatically improved drug sensitivity of breast cancer
by reducing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression via inhibiting the Raf-1/AP-1 pathway,
providing a novel therapeutic target to overcome MDR in breast cancer.

apoptosis and the major factor of MDR pathogenesis
is the high expression of MDR proteins of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters
in cell membranes, especially multidrug efflux transporter
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [4, 5]. P-gp, a plasma membrane
glycoprotein encoded by the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1, also known as multidrug
resistance gene 1 (MDR1)), is one of the main multidrug
transporters and has an important impact on the absorption,
distribution and elimination of chemotherapeutic drugs [6].
P-gp can recognize chemotherapeutic drugs as substrates,
pump substrates out of tumor cells and restrict the uptake
of substrates in an ATP-dependent manner [7], which leads
to a decrease of intracellular drug accumulation and soon
causes resistance to numerous drugs in cancer cells [8].
Therefore, P-gp is regarded as the most important MDRregulatory drug target and inhibition of P-gp expression
would be an effective therapeutic approach to overcome
MDR and enhance the therapeutic effect.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers
and the gradually increasing incidence of breast cancer is
the leading cause of cancer death among women in the
world [1]. Chemotherapy is the main treatment of breast
cancer. Chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel (PTX)
and adriamycin (ADR) have been widely used in the
treatment of various solid tumors including breast cancer
[2]. However, multidrug resistance (MDR) gradually
emerges in clinical trials by using chemotherapeutic
agents alone or combined with other antineoplastic agents
and is becoming a major clinical obstacle and paramount
factor in the failure of breast cancer chemotherapy and the
human body has become insensitive to antitumor drugs
due to MDR [3].
The mechanisms related to MDR are multifarious,
such as the increased drug efflux, activation of DNA
repair process and the deregulation of drug-induced

Galectin-1 (Gal-1), a homodimer of 14 kDa subunits,
is a member of the galectin family of carbohydrate binding
proteins and contains two β-galactoside binding sites [9].
Gal-1 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes of
tumorigenesis, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell
invasiveness, migration, and angiogenesis and regulates
the interaction between tumor cells and components of
tumor microenvironment [10]. Besides, Gal-1 has been
demonstrated as a therapeutic target by identifying the
overexpression of Gal-1 in human cancer including breast
cancer [10, 11].
Raf, a member of Raf family of serine/threonine
kinases, is ubiquitously expressed and activated by the Ras
family of GTPases, which is involved in survival, cell growth
and differentiation of tumors [12]. Raf is involved in a broad
range of cancers and functions as an oncogene that regulates
mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) pathway and cell
proliferation to promote tumourigenesis [13]. The activation
of MAPK pathway, which is regulated by phosphorylation of
some signaling protein kinases including Ras, Raf, and Raf
upstream activator PKC, has important roles in mediating
signals caused by growth factors, cytokines, and environment
stress and is associated with cell proliferation, survival,
differentiation and apoptosis [14]. It has been reported that
an intact Gal-1 interface of stacked dimers of H-Ras, Raf and
Gal-1 as building blocks is required for Gal-1 to modulate
Ras nanoclustering, thus representing a potential drug target
site in cancer associated Ras-mutations [15]. The protooncogenes c-Jun and c-Fos are the main components of the
AP-1 transcription factor complex in the downstream of Ras/
Raf and are crucial for Ras/Raf-mediated cell proliferation
and transformation [16]. Additionally, AP-1 regulates the
activation of numerous genes transcription and is a main
target of MAPK signaling pathway [17]. AP-1 is associated
with various cellular processes, such as cell differentiation,
proliferation, survival and apoptosis [18].
In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of
Gal-1 knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis of the
MDR breast cancer cell lines and the relationship between
Gal-1 and Raf-1/AP-1 signaling pathway to further study
the molecular mechanism of MDR, providing a novel
therapeutic approach to overcome MDR in breast cancer.

addition, the mRNA expressions of Gal-1 in breast cancer
patients were positively correlated with MDR1 (r = 0.736,
P = 0.0001) (Figure 1C). Besides, Gal-1 was found to
be dramatically higher in mRNA and protein levels in
MCF-7 cells than that in MCF-10A cells and the mRNA
and protein levels of Gal-1 in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/
ADR cells were strikingly higher than that in MCF-7
cells (Figure 1D, 1E and 1F). The expressions of MDR1
mRNA and protein P-gp in MCF-7 cells were significantly
higher than that in MCF-10A cells and dramatically lower
than that in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells (Figure
1G, 1H and 1I). These differential expressions suggested
that Gal-1 and MDR1 may play important roles in breast
cancer development and resistance.

Gal-1 knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PTX
and ADR in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells
To determine cell sensitivity to PTX and ADR,
MCF-7, MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells were treated
with different concentrations of PTX or ADR for 24 h.
Cell survival rates were assessed by MTT assay and the
results showed that the cell survival rates of MCF-7/PTX
cells at 10 nM, 15 nM and 20 nM of PTX and MCF-7/
ADR cells at 200 nM, 300 nM and 400 nM of ADR were
significantly higher than those in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2A
and 2B), which confirmed the PTX resistance in MCF-7/
PTX cells and ADR resistance in MCF-7/ADR cells. IC50
of MCF cells to PTX (15 nM) and IC50 of MCF cells to
ADR (300 nM) were chosen for sequential studies.
Considering the upregulation of Gal-1 in MCF7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells, Gal-1 knockdown was
performed to observe its effect on the drug resistance of
MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells. The cell viability
and apoptosis in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells
transfected with Gal-1 siRNA1 or Gal-1 siRNA2 were
evaluated by MTT assay and flow cytometry with
or without PTX or ADR treatment. As presented in
Figure 2C and 2D, Gal-1 siRNA1 and Gal-1 siRNA2
significantly decreased the levels of Gal-1 in MCF-7/
PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells, indicating the efficiency of
siRNAs in silencing Gal-1 expression. Gal-1 knockdown
or (PTX or ADR) treatment resulted in an obvious
decrease in cell viability; however, combination of Gal-1
knockdown with PTX or ADR resulted in a lower cell
viability than chemotherapy group alone in MCF-7/
PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells (Figure 2E and 2F). Gal-1
knockdown or (PTX or ADR) treatment led to a marked
increase in cell apoptosis; however, combination of Gal1 knockdown with PTX or ADR induced a higher cell
apoptosis than chemotherapy group alone in MCF-7/PTX
and MCF-7/ADR cells (Figure 2G and 2H). These results
showed that Gal-1 knockdown improved the sensitivity
against PTX and ADR in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR
cells via the inhibition of cell viability and induction of
cell apoptosis.

RESULTS
Gal-1 and MDR1 levels were both upregulated in
breast tumor tissues and cell lines
To evaluate the potential role of Gal-1 and MDR1
in breast cancer, the expression levels of Gal-1 and
MDR1 in MCF-10A, MCF-7, MCF-7/PTX, MCF-7/ADR
cells, normal tissues and breast tumor tissues samples
were detected by qRT-CPR and western blot. As shown
in Figure 1A and 1B, qRT-PCR results indicated that
Gal and MDR1 were significantly upregulated in breast
tumor tissues compared with that in normal tissues. In

Overexpression of MDR1 reduced the sensitivity
to PTX and ADR induced by Gal-1 knockdown
in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells

To explore the effect of overexpression of
MDR1ondrug sensitivity induced by Gal-1 knockdown
in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells, cells were
treated with (Gal-1 siRNA1 + drug) or (Gal-1 siRNA1
+ drug + pcDNA-MDR1). The MTT assay showed
that combination of Gal-1 siRNA1 and PTX or Gal-1
siRNA1 and ADR strikingly suppressed the relative
cell viability of MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells
compared to (Con siRNA + drug) group, whereas MDR1
overexpression reversed these negative effects (Figure
3C and 3D). Flow cytometry assay indicated that Gal-1
siRNA1 and PTX or Gal-1 siRNA1 and ADR obviously
induced apoptosis of MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR
cells compared with (Con siRNA + drug) group, while
MDR1 overexpression attenuated the induction effects

To explore the effect of Gal-1 knockdown or MDR1
overexpression on P-gp protein in MCF-7/PTX and MCF7/ADR cells, cells were transfected Gal-1 siRNA1, Gal1 siRNA2, (Gal-1 siRNA1 + pcDNA-MDR1) or (Gal-1
siRNA2 + pcDNA-MDR1). The western blot results
indicated that Gal-1 siRNA1 and Gal-1 siRNA2 both
significantly decreased the levels of P-gp in MCF-7/PTX
and MCF-7/ADR cells compared with corresponding
control groups, while MDR1 overexpression alleviated
the inhibition effects of Gal-1 siRNA1 or Gal-1 siRNA2
on P-gp (Figure 3A and 3B).

(Figure 3E and 3F). These data demonstrated that
overexpression of MDR1 significantly decreased the
sentivity to PTX and ADR induced by Gal-1 knockdown
in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells via the increase
of cell viability and reduction of cell apoptosis.

(Ser73), c-Jun and c-Fos in MCF-7/PTX cells (Figure
5A), and Raf-1 inhibitor GW5074 obviously reduced the
levels of P-gp, p-Raf-1 (Ser338), p-c-Jun (Ser73), c-Jun
and c-Fos in MCF-7/ADR cells (Figure 5B), suggesting
the validity of Raf-1 siRNAs and Raf-1 inhibitor GW5074
in suppressing the Raf-1/AP-1 signaling pathway.
The relative cell viability and apoptosis in MCF-7/PTX
cells treated with (Raf-1 siRNA1 + PTX) or (Raf-1 siRNA1
+ pcDNA-MDR1 + PTX) were assessed by MTT assay and
flow cytometry. The results showed that combination of Raf1 siRNA1 and PTX dramatically inhibited cell viability and
induced cell apoptosis in MCF-7/PTX cells compared with
(PTX + Con siRNA) group, whereas MDR1 overexpression
abated these effects (Figure 5C and 5E). Additionally, MCF7/ADR cells were treated with GW5074 or (GW5074 +
ADR) or (GW5074 + pcDNA-MDR1 + ADR). MTT assay
and flow cytometry showed that combination of GW5074
and ADR significantly decreased cell viability and promoted
apoptosis in MCF-7/ADR cells compared with ADR
treatment group, while MDR1 overexpression overturned
these effects (Figure 5D and 5F). These data suggested that
Galectin-1 knockdown enhanced sensitivity aganist PTX and
ADR by decreasing P-gp expression through suppressing the
Raf-1/AP-1 signaling pathway

Gal-1 knockdown significantly suppressed the
Raf-1/AP-1 signaling pathway
The levels of p-Raf-1 (Ser338), Raf-1, p-c-Jun
(Ser73), c-Jun and c-Fos were determined by western blot to
investigate the effect of Gal-1 knockdown on the Raf-1/AP-1
signaling pathway. As compared with Con siRNA group,
Gal-1 siRNA1 and Gal-1 siRNA2 significantly decreased the
levels of p-Raf-1 (Ser338), p-c-Jun (Ser73), c-Jun and c-Fos
in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells, indicating that Gal-1
knockdown dramatically decreased the phosphorylation of
Raf-1 and the induction of AP-1 activity in MCF-7/PTX and
MCF-7/ADR cells (Figure 4A and 4B).

DISCUSSION

The Raf-1 siRNAs and Raf-1 inhibitor GW5074
were used to inhibit Raf-1 activity to further observe the
underlying mechanism of Gal-1 knockdown on MDR of
breast cancer cells. The western blot results showed that
Raf-1 siRNA1 and Raf-1 siRNA2 dramatically decreased
the levels of P-gp, p-Raf-1 (Ser338), Raf-1, p-c-Jun

as breast cancer [19], lung cancer [20], and prostate
cancer [21]. Gal-1 has distinct biological roles in
tumor progression, including cell growth, apoptosis,
metastasis, and immunosuppression and is involved in
poor prognosis and the metastatic phenotype [22, 23]. For
example, Zhang et al. reported that Gal-1 overexpression
promoted tumorigenesis and Gal-1 knockdown led to
the reduction in cell growth, migration and invasion
in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) [24]. Zheng et al.
showed that overexpression of Gal-1 promoted cell
invasion and migration and suppressed cell apoptosis by
enhancing TGF-β signaling in gastric cancer [25]. Wiest
et al. manifested that Gal-1 showed apoptotic potential in
human breast cancer and trophoblast tumor cells [26]. Zhu
et al. reported that Gal-1 was highly expressed in human
breast tumor tissues and Gal-1 knockdown in carcinomaassociated fibroblasts inhibited cell migration and invasion
by suppressing the expression of matrix metalloprotein 9
(MMP-9) [19]. In the present study, we demonstrated that
Gal-1 was highly expressed in breast tumor tissues and
cells as compared with normal tissues and cells. Besides,
Gal-1 expression was significantly higher in MDR
breast cancer cells MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR. Gal-1
knockdown dramatically increased sensitivity to ADR and
PTX in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells by inhibiting
cell proliferation and enhancing apoptosis.
MDR to chemotherapeutic agents is the main cause
of chemotherapy failure of breast cancer. P-pg/MDR1
overexpression is one of the main causes leading to
MDR phenomenon in breast cancer and plays a crucial
role in producing MDR in breast cancer cells [27]. For
example, He et al. reported that MDR1 silencing resulted
in a decrease of P-pg activity and drug sensitivity of yolk
sac carcinoma [28]. Liu et al. manifested that siMDR1
effectively reduced the expression of MDR1 and led to
a remarkable increase of chemosensitivity to PTX [29].
In the present study, we discovered that the mRNA and
protein expression levels of MDR1 were higher in breast
tumor tissues and cells than that in normal breast tissues
and cells and MDR1 overexpression obviously decreased
sensitivity to ADR and PTX induced by Gal-1 knockdown
in MCF-7/PTX and MCF-7/ADR cells by promoting cell
proliferation and suppressing apoptosis.
Previous studies have reported that Raf and AP-1
signaling pathway is related to MDR [30]. For example,
Mukherjee et al. reported that Her2/Raf-1/MAPK/AP-1
pathway contributed to the development of castrateresistance prostate cancer, resulting in early relapse and
reduced disease-specific survival [31]. Kreiseder et al.
reported that the cytoskeletal linker protein α-catulin
chemosensitized melanoma cells by activating NF-κB and
AP-1 [32]. Yang et al. found that upregulation of miR195 improved the sensitivity to ADR in breast cancer by
suppressing Raf-1 [33]. In addition, it is convincingly
demonstrated that both AP-1 and NF-κB were transcription
factors of P-gp [34]. More importantly, NF-κB was
demonstrated to induce drug resistance by improving the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MDR1 gene expression in cancer cells [35]. Moreover,
a previous study uncovered that ectopic expression of
Gal-1 mediated chemoresistence of chronic myeloid
leukemia cells by inducing MDR1 expression via P38
MAPK activation and NF-κB translocation [36]. In the
present study, we noted that Gal-1 knockdown markedly
reduced the levels of P-pg, p-Raf-1 (Ser338), p-c-Jun (Ser
73), c-Jun and c-Fos. These results manifested that Gal-1
knockdown enhanced sensitivity against PTX and ADR
by reducing P-glycoprotein expression via suppressing the
Raf-1/AP-1 signaling pathway
In conclusion, we found that Gal-1 and P-gp were
both upregulated in breast tumor tissues and cells and Gal1 knockdown dramatically improved drug sensitivity of
breast cancer cells by reducing P-gp expression through
inhibiting the Raf-1/AP-1 signaling pathway, providing a
novel evidence that combining the depletion of Gal-1 with
drugs PTX or ADR is a potential method for the therapy of
patients with breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and tumor tissues
Breast tumor tissues and corresponding normal tissues
from 20 patients with breast cancer were collected from
the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. The
experiments were carried out with approval of the Ethic
Committee of Zhengzhou University. Informed consent was
obtained from all patients for using their tissues. The human
breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and human breast epithelial
cell line (MCF-10A) were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA).
MCR-7 derived adriamycin (ADR) resistant cells MCF7/ADR and paclitaxel (PTX) resistant cells MCF-7/PTX
were established as previously described [37], which were
induced drug resistance by pre-treating MCF-7 cells with
continuously increasing concentrations of ADR and PTX
over 8 months. The MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells were grown
in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco-BRL), 100
U/mL penicillin/streptomycin/kanamycin (Genom Co., Ltd.,
Hangzhou, China) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2.

Cell transfection
Double strand siRNA nucleotides targeting Gal-1
(Gal-1 siRNA1 and Gal-1 siRNA2), double strand siRNA
nucleotides targeting Raf-1 (Raf-1 siRNA1 and Raf-1
siRNA2), scrambled siRNA (Con siRNA), pcDNA 3.1MDR1, and pcDNA 3.1 empty vectors were purchased
from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China).
For transient transfection, 50,000 cells were seeded into
six-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Then the
cells were transfected with different siRNAs, pcDNAMDR1 or respective controls by Lipofectamine 2000

48 h in the serum-free medium. The cells with scrambled
siRNA transfection were used as the control.

China) was used to detect the concentrations of proteins.
Subsequently, samples (50 μg) were separated on 10%
sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnolgy) and
then blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica,
MA,USA). Following blocked with 5% milk in Trisbuffer saline (TBST) at 37°C for 1 h, the membranes
were incubated with monoclonal antibodies (MDR1/Pgp, p-Raf-1, Raf-1, p-c-Jun (Ser73), c-Jun, c-Fos, and
β-actin) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA) with 1:500, 1:1000, 1:500, 1:1000, 1:500, 1:500,
and 1:2000 dilutions overnight at 4°C, respectively. The
membranes were then washed three times with TBST
and labeled with horseradishperoxidase-conjugated
anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilutions).
Following washing three times, the blots were visualized
by Electrochemiluminescence Plus Detection system
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and analyzed using
an Image Scanner (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala,
Sweden). The β-actin was used as the internal control.

Cell viability analysis
MCF, MCF-7/ADR, and MCF-7/PTX cells (2×104
cells/well) were incubated in 96-well plates for 24 h and
then the cells were transferred into 100 μl fresh culture
medium containing different concentrations of PTX (2.5,
5, 10, 15, and 20 nM) or ADR (50, 100, 200, 300, and
400 nM). Cells with no additives were used as the control.
Following 48 h incubation, 20 μl (0.5 mg/ml) MTT was
added to each well and incubated for an additional 4 h
at 37°C and then 200 μl DMSO was added to dissolve
the MTT formazan precipitate for 15 min after the
medium was removed. After the crystals were completely
dissolved, the absorbance value at 490 nm in each well
was analyzed by a microplate reader (SPECTRAmax;
Molecular Device Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The IC50
values were calculated using the non-linear regression
curve fit of the Graphpad Prism5 software. The cell
viability in all transfected cells were detected using the
method described above.

Cell apoptosis assay
MCF-7/ADR and MCF-7/PTX cells transfected
with Gal siRNA1, Gal siRNA2, si-control, pcDNA 3.1MDR1, or pcDNA 3.1 empty vectors were seeded in sixwell plates at a density of 2×105 cells/well. Following
incubation for 24 h, cells were treated with 15 nM PTX or
300 nM ADR for 48 h. Then the cells were collected and
washed three times with PBS, followed by centrifugation
at 2×103 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 100 μL binding
buffer. Subsequently, 5 μL Annexin V-FITC was added
for incubation for 10 min, followed by 5 μL propidium
iodide (PI) for 15 min incubation. The apoptotic cells
were analyzed by using the FACScan flow cytometry
and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA).

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
The RAN from the breast cancer cell lines,
normal breast tissue and breast tumor tissue samples
were isolated by TransZolTMUp (TransGen Biotech,
Beijing, China). For the detection of Gal-1 and MDR1
mRNA expression, the complementary DNA (cDNA)
was reversely transcribed using RT reagent kit (Takara,
Shiga, Japan). The RT-PCR was used to evaluate the
mRNA expression of Gal-1 and MDR1 with the SYBR
green detection system (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) in an ABI7500 sequence detection system (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The procedure of RTPCR was performed as follows: denaturing temperature
95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 sec, 35 cycles at 95°C for 30
s, and 60°C for 20 s. The primers used were as follows:
forward,

for MDR1. The mRNA expression of GAPDH was used
as the endogenous control.

Statistical analysis
Data from each group were presented as the mean
± standard deviation (SD) error from at least three
independent experiments. Comparison between two
groups was performed by Student’s t test and differences
for three or more groups were analyzed using one-way
ANOVA tests. Statistical analysis was conducted using
graph prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Prism, San Diego,
CA). A statistically significant difference was considered
at a P value less than 0.05.

Western blot
For western blot analysis, the cells (1×106/ml) with
all siRNAs, pcDNA 3.1 MDR1 or respective controls
transfection or with GW5074 (5 or 10 μM) (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) treatment for 1 h were harvested and
lysed in RIPA buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnolgy,
Haimen, China) for 30 min. The bicinchoninic acid
