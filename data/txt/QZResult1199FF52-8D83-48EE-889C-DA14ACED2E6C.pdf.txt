Abstract
Targeted therapeutics hold tremendous promise in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. However, targeting
proteins individually can be compensated for by bypass mechanisms and activation of regulatory loops. Designing optimal therapeutic combinations must therefore take into consideration the complex dynamic networks in
the cell. In this study, we analyzed the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling network in the MDA-MB231
breast cancer cell line. We used reverse-phase protein array to measure the transient changes in the phosphorylation of proteins after IGF-1 stimulation. We developed a computational procedure that integrated mass action modeling with particle swarm optimization to train the model against the experimental data and infer the
unknown model parameters. The trained model was used to predict how targeting individual signaling proteins
altered the rest of the network and identify drug combinations that minimally increased phosphorylation of
other proteins elsewhere in the network. Experimental testing of the modeling predictions showed that optimal
drug combinations inhibited cell signaling and proliferation, whereas nonoptimal combination of inhibitors
increased phosphorylation of nontargeted proteins and rescued cells from cell death. The integrative approach
described here is useful for generating experimental intervention strategies that could optimize drug combinations and discover novel pharmacologic targets for cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 70(17); 6704–14. ©2010 AACR.

Major Findings
Simple and reliable strategies are needed to identify
optimal combinations of molecular targeted drugs to
treat individual cancer patients, to realize the fullest
potential of a targeted therapeutic approach.

Introduction
Cell signaling networks are complex systems that integrate
information from the cellular environment (1–5). Maps of
complex networks were derived by interconnecting the individual pathways obtained from experimental data (6, 7).
These studies revealed that signaling networks contain numerous features, such as feedback and feedforward loops
(8, 9), which render it virtually impossible for the human
mind to decipher how signals are integrated within the pathAuthors' Affiliation: Department of Systems Biology, The University of

ways. Thus, computational approaches are needed to elucidate the regulatory properties of signaling networks (10–12).
Several groups have used ordinary differential equations
(ODE) to analyze the dynamics of signaling networks and
generate experimentally testable predictions (6, 13–17). The
use of mass action ODE modeling, however, is impaired
because of incomplete knowledge about the concentrations
and kinetics of signaling intermediates.
Inferring the parameters for mass action modeling in signaling networks is challenging. The most common approach
is to obtain parameters from the literature and fit the models
to the experimental data to infer those that remain unknown
(6, 13, 18–24). Unfortunately, the kinetic parameters reported
in the literature may differ by orders of magnitude, depending on experimental conditions. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether discrepancies between computational and
experimental data are due to inaccurate measures or incomplete modeling. Parameter estimation can be effectively
accomplished using optimization methods, which enable
quantitative model fitting to experimental data (25–31).
However, the experimental techniques used to measure the
activity of signaling proteins mainly provide qualitative or
semiquantitative data. Optimization strategies are thus needed to identify sets of model parameters that equally fit the
qualitative experimental data.
Another challenge in the analysis of signaling networks is
the identification of optimal target combinations. The most
common methods of computational target identification are
based on formulating mathematical models and designing

Integrative Identification of Optimal Drug Combinations

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
Mass action modeling
The dynamics of the IGFR network in MDA-MB231 cells were described using a mass action model of ODEs formulated as follows:
Step 1: The pathways comprising the IGFR network were reconstructed into a set of chemical reactions that described the
simplified mechanisms of activation and inhibition of relevant proteins. For example, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
phosphorylation was assumed to be catalyzed by MAPK kinase [MAP/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)/MAPKK]
and occurred through an enzymatic reaction:
kf1

MAP K þ MEK 

K2

! C ! MAP K  þ MEK 


ð1Þ

kr1

In equation 1, k1f, k1r, and K2 are the forward, reverse, and dissociation kinetic rate constants, respectively.
Step 2: The set of chemical reactions was transformed into a system of coupled ODEs by assuming that the dynamics of the
IGFR network obeyed the law of mass action. Specifically, the accumulation rate of the concentration of the ith signaling intermediate was expressed as the difference between its net rates of production (rp,i) and consumption (rc,i). Thus, the accumulation
rate of the concentration of MEK* was expressed as follows:
X


dMEK  X
rc;MEK  ¼ kf1 ½MAP K	½MEK  	 þ kr1 þ K2 ½C	
ð2Þ
¼
rp;MEK  
dt
In equation 2, [MAPK], [MEK*], and [C] denote the concentration of MAPK, MEK* and C, respectively.
The list of chemical reactions that described the consensus activation and inhibition mechanisms of proteins involved in the
IGFR network and the corresponding system of ODEs are listed in Supplementary Material S1. To implement mass action modeling, it was necessary to infer the unknown model parameters, which are the kinetic rate constants and the initial concentrations of the proteins. In this regard, we trained the mass action model against transient data measured by RPPA using PSO. We
selected PSO because of its superior ability to converge to more optimal solutions compared with other optimization algorithms
(see Discussion).
Particle swarm optimization
PSO is a stochastic algorithm that mimics the behavior of swarms of animals that search for food (36). Particles in the swarm
have a position xij, a velocity vij, and a fitness fi, in which i and j represent the number of particles and the dimension of the space
solution, respectively. Each particle remembers its best position xijL locally and the best position xjG globally reached by the entire
swarm. During the iterative search for food, particles update their position and velocities to improve their fitness according to the
following rules:
h
i
h

ij ðt þ 1Þ ¼ !ij ðtÞ þ c1 r1 xLij ðtÞ  xij ðtÞ þ c2 r2 xG
j ðtÞ  xij ðtÞ
xij ðt þ 1Þ ¼ xij ðtÞ þ ij ðtÞ

ð3Þ

In equations 3, ω is the inertia factor; r1 and r2 are two random numbers uniformly distributed in the interval [0,1]; and c1 and c2
are the coefficients of self-recognition and social component (see ref. 37 and Supplementary Material S2 for details on parameters
in equations 3).
In our settings, the particle positions represented the unknown parameter values used in the mass action model to generate
computationally the time courses of proteins that are measured by RPPA; the particle velocities denoted the extent to which the
parameter values were iteratively changed; and the particle fitness was defined as the distance between the time courses of proteins experimentally and computationally measured. Model parameters were randomly initialized and iteratively changed according to equation 3 until the distance between the time courses of the measured and predicted proteins was minimal (i.e., optimal
fitness). The distance between computed and measured time courses was evaluated using the SD-weighted square error:
h

In equation 4, y˜ ijm and σ( yijm ) represent the mean and SD, respectively, of the proteins measured by RPPA, whereas yijc denotes the
protein levels computed using the mass action model. Moreover, s represents the total number of data points comprising a single
time course, and r is the total number of time courses. PSO was implemented to minimize the SD-weighted square error and train
the mass action model against RPPA data to estimate the unknown model parameters.

intervention strategies through environmental, genetic, and
signaling perturbations (32–34). This approach can predict
the effect of available drugs on signaling network dynamics,
but it does not facilitate the search for drug combinations
that would optimally inhibit aberrant signaling. Another
strategy is to integrate mass action modeling with simulated
annealing into a multiple-target optimal intervention (35).
Because this approach is computationally expensive, alternative procedures are needed to enable the rapid search for targets in disease-related networks.
In this study, we used reverse-phase protein array
(RPPA) to measure the transient response of the MDAMB231 breast cancer cell line after stimulation by insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). The reason for choosing
the IGF receptor (IGFR) network is 2-fold: There is a large
amount of experimental data and biological resources allowing us to build a consensus network and experimentally
test it; components of this network are being targeted in
several clinical trials for cancer therapy, thus having clinical applicability. We developed a computational procedure
that integrated mass action modeling with particle swarm
optimization (PSO) to train the model against normalized
time courses of phosphorylated proteins in MDA-MB231
cells and infer sets of unknown model parameters that
equally fit the measured data. The trained mass action
model was used to predict the effect of a targeted perturbation and tested using experimental data. The trained and
tested mass action model was then used to identify the
most influential molecules responsible for aberrant cell signaling and determine the optimal combinations of inhibitors and small interfering RNAs for inhibiting abnormal
signaling in MDA-MB231 cells. Immunoblotting and cell viability assay were then used to test and validate the effect
of drug combinations predicted by the mass action model.
Our integrative approach is useful for generating experimental intervention strategies that could optimize drug
combinations and discovering novel pharmacologic targets
for cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and stimulation
The human MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line (K-Ras
and B-Raf mutants) was purchased from the America Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). The cell line was validated by
STR DNA fingerprinting using the AmpFlSTR Identifiler kit
(Applied Biosystems). The STR profiles were compared with
known ATCC fingerprints (http://www.atcc.org/) and to the
Cell Line Integrated Molecular Authentication database version 0.1.200808 (38). Cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were serum starved
overnight and then subjected to treatment with 75 ng/mL
IGF-1 (Cell Signaling Technology). For RPPA, cells were
pretreated with 10 μmol/L U0126 (Promega) for 4 hours,
followed by IGF-1 stimulation for 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes. For immunoblotting, cells were pretreated with
10 μmol/L U0126, 50 μmol/L LY294002 (CalbiochemNova-Biochem Corp.) and 50 nmol/L rapamycin (Calbiochem-

6706

Nova-Biochem Corp.), individually or combined, for 1 hour,
followed by IGF-1 stimulation for 5 or 60 minutes. For RPPA
and immunoblotting, controls were incubated for the
corresponding times with DMSO.
Antibodies
The following antibodies were used for RPPA and immunoblotting: anti–phospho-MAPK (T202/Y204), anti–phospho-GSK3 (S21/S9), anti–phospho-AKT (ser473), anti–
phospho-TSC2 (T1462), anti–phospho-mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR; S2448), anti–phospho-P70S6K
(T389), anti-MAPK (p44/42), anti-AKT, anti-TSC2 (28A7),
anti-mTOR, anti-P70S6K, and anti-actin were from Cell Signaling Technology; and anti-GSK3 was from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed using standard procedures.
Reverse-phase protein array
Serial diluted lysates were arrayed on nitrocellulose-coated
FAST slides (Whatman) using the Aushon 2470 Arrayer
(Aushon Biosystems). Each slide was probed with a primary
antibody plus a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody. The
signal was amplified using the DakoCytomation-catalyzed
system (DAKO) and visualized using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
colorimetric reaction. The slides were scanned, analyzed, and
quantified using the customized Microvigene software (VigeneTech, Inc.) to measure spot intensity. Each dilution curve
was fitted with the logistic model “Supercurve Fitting” (39).
The mean values of the protein levels in the nonstimulated
cells were used to normalize the time courses of the phosphorylated proteins measured in IGF-1–stimulated cells.
Crystal violet cell viability assay
Viability assay was performed using standard procedures.
Cells were treated for 3 days with the following: U0126 (concentration of 0.1–100 μmol/L), LY294002 (concentration of 0.1–100
μmol/L), or rapamycin (concentration of 0.1–100 nmol/L);
combination of U0126 (concentration of 0.5–50 μmol/L) and
LY294002 [fixed at its quarter maximal effective concentration
(EC25) value of 3.8 μmol/L] or rapamycin (fixed at its EC25 value of 0.1 nmol/L); and combination of U0126 (fixed at its EC25
value of 3.5 μmol/L) and rapamycin (concentration of 0.5 to 50
nmol/L). Corresponding controls were incubated with DMSO.
The EC25 of each inhibitor was estimated (Supplementary Material S3) using Microsoft GraphPad Prism.
Computational procedures
Computational procedures are described in Supplementary Material S2.

complexes with IGFR and triggers IGFR autophosphorylation
(40). Phosphorylated IGFR propagates the signal downstream
through the MAPK and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)
pathways, and leads to MAPK and protein kinase B (PKB/
AKT) phosphorylation (4, 5). The signals from the MAPK
and PI3K cascades are routed to the mTOR pathway through
tuberous sclerosis (TSC2) inactivation (1). Phosphorylated
mTOR activates protein S6 kinase of 70 kDa (p70S6K), which
inactivates the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) through
a negative feedback loop (41). A detailed description of the
network topology is provided in Supplementary Material
S1. We used RPPA (42–46) to determine the changes in the
phosphorylation of proteins in the IGFR network after IGF-1
stimulation. To account for the intrinsic variability of these
assays, all experiments were performed in three independent

repeats. Figure 1B shows the time courses of the measured
phosphorylated proteins; the curves show the protein fold
change over the corresponding controls (Materials and
Methods). After IGF-1 stimulation, the level of phosphoAKT peaked at 30 minutes (28-fold increase) and then settled
toward a lower level at 120 minutes (18-fold increase).
In contrast, signal transduction across the MAPK cascade
remained essentially unchanged likely as a result of MAPK
constitutive activation driven by K-Ras and B-Raf mutations in MDA-MB231 cells. AKT activation triggered glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) and TSC2 downregulation
through phosphorylation, and TSC2 inactivation facilitated
phospho-mTOR and phospho-p70S6K upregulation. Thus,
the levels of p-GSK3, p-TSC2, p-mTOR, and p-p70S6K initially increased and then adjusted to stationary levels.

Complementing mass action modeling with PSO
Mass action modeling and model reduction. To predict
the dynamics of the IGFR network after IGF-1 stimulation in
MDA-MB231 cells, we developed a mass action ODE model.
Our formulation was based on a set of 77 chemical reactions
that described the consensus activation and inhibition
mechanisms of proteins involved in the IGFR network. The
resulting mass action model was structured into 127 ODEs
and 313 unknown parameters. To decrease the complexity
of the model, we developed a reduced version of the original
model. The 77 chemical reactions were reduced to a subset
of 41 reactions to describe the simplified interaction
mechanisms of the most relevant species in the IGFR network, and the original model was reduced to 65 ODEs and
161 model unknowns (Supplementary Material S4). We
tested and validated the ability of the reduced model to
adequately describe IGFR dynamics by showing that the protein profiles predicted by the reduced model matched those
generated by the original model for randomly selected sets of
parameters (Supplementary Material S5). Therefore, throughout the article, we exclusively used the reduced model to predict the dynamics of IGFR signaling network.
Model training. The measured time course data of proteins in MDA-MB231 cells contain relevant information
about the regulatory loops comprising the IGFR network.
To exploit this information to optimally inhibit aberrant
pathways, we used PSO to fit the model to the time courses
of p-AKT, p-MAPK, p-GSK3, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p-TSC2
proteins and infer the 161 unknown parameters. Studies
published in the literature typically use only two or three
“readout” molecules to fit ODE models to experimental data
and infer unknown parameters (14, 15, 26). In our study, we
trained our model using six readout proteins and 126 experimental data points combined into a scalar fitness.
Because of the substantial degree of uncertainty in parameter estimation, fitting mass action models to the qualitative
data measured on RPPA required the identification of multiple trajectories that equally resembled the measured protein
profiles. Using the integrative mass action modeling PSO
procedure, we identified 10 sets of model parameters that
equally fit the measured data (Supplementary File S1). We
characterized the parameter regimens by ranking the parameters according to their coefficient of variation (CV) and
found that 69% of them had a CV smaller than 1 (Fig. 1C).
We calculated the means and SD of the identified trajectories
to represent the entire set and the fitting variability. Figure 1B
shows the mean trajectories and the fitting variability
identified by the mass action model, which had been trained
using PSO against normalized protein profiles measured on
RPPA after IGF-1 stimulation of MDA-MB231 cells. The
simulation results indicated that the integrative procedure
adequately fit the time courses of all measured proteins.
Model testing. To determine the ability of the trained
model to correctly generate responses to perturbations that
have not been explicitly included in the training data set, we
used it to predict the dynamics of the IGFR network after
inhibition of MEK. Figure 2A shows the transient IGFR signaling response to targeted MEK inhibition, as predicted by

the trained mass action model. MEK inhibition led to significant downregulation of its immediate downstream effector,
p-MAPK. Inhibition of p-MAPK attenuated the inhibition of
IRS-1 through direct interaction and through the p70S6K
feedback loop. Consequently, p-AKT was upregulated. Activation of p-AKT increased the level of p-TSC2 but did not
affect the level of p-mTOR or GSK3. Signals from the MAPK
and mTOR cascades were integrated into the p70S6K pathway and led to p-p70S6K downregulation.
The computational results were experimentally tested
using an independent set of 252 data points measured by
RPPA. Figure 2B shows the levels of p-AKT, p-MAPK,
p-GSK3, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p-TSC2 detected in triplicate in IGF-1–stimulated MDA-MB231 cells in the absence
of the MEK inhibitor and after 4 hours of incubation with
the MEK inhibitor. The experimental data indicated that
MEK inhibition increased p-AKT and p-TSC2 levels, decreased p-MAPK and p-p70S6K levels, and slightly decreased
p-GSK3 levels but had no significant effect on p-mTOR levels.
Despite the limited discrepancy between the computed and
measured profiles of p-GSK3, the experimental results adequately matched those predicted by the model. Therefore,
the trained mass action model correctly predicted the effect
of MEK inhibition on IGFR dynamics.

pathways measured in MDA-MB231 cells, we used the
trained and tested mass action model to predict the response of the IGFR network after molecules in the network had been individually inhibited (Supplementary
Material S6). Figure 3 and Supplementary Material S6 show
the differential levels of proteins in inhibited versus noninhibited MDA-MB231 cells after IGF-1 stimulation, as predicted by the mass action model for 3 of the 10 sets of
parameters inferred using PSO (Supplementary File S2).
These three sets were randomly selected to repeat the
computational analysis in triplicate. The modeling results
suggested that targeting one molecule at a time may activate nontargeted molecules, likely as a result of feedback
loop compensation. Thus, targeting a single molecule may
not be sufficient to adequately inhibit aberrant signaling.
Although inhibition of molecules in the MAPK pathway

6710

Cancer Res; 70(17) September 1, 2010

was predicted to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, inhibition of intermediates comprising the PI3K/AKT pathway
was predicted to activate the MAPK pathway. Because
these pathways are often upregulated in many tumors
(47), the combined inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K/
AKT cascades emerged as a candidate strategy to inhibit
aberrant signaling in MDA-MB231 cells.
Combined inhibition of targeted molecules. Predicting
the response of IGFR networks to the inhibition of individual
molecules may not necessarily identify optimal drug combinations for pharmacologic intervention. In contrast, perturbing all molecules in the network simultaneously would
identify optimal combinations needed to inhibit aberrant
signaling. From a computational point of view, the effect of
small interfering RNAs can be mimicked by varying the initial
concentration of signaling proteins. The effect of the drug

inhibitor can be approximately simulated by varying the
values of rescaled kinetic rate constants, such as in the classic example of competitive inhibition (48). Integrating mass
action modeling with a random sampling of kinetic constants (inhibitors) and initial protein concentrations (small
interfering RNAs) within predefined intervals of values would
thus provide an unbiased, unsupervised means of computationally predicting the effect of simultaneously perturbing all
molecules in the IGFR network (computational procedures).
Combinations of signaling targets were identified by comparing the model parameters inferred using PSO from data
measured in MDA-MB231 cells with randomly sampled model parameters that could restore user-defined signaling output. We defined the signaling network characterized by the

measured time courses of p-AKT, p-MAPK, and p-p70S6K as
aberrant, as these proteins are often upregulated in many
tumors (47). We defined the state at which p-AKT, p-MAPK,
and p-p70S6K levels were inhibited by at least 5-fold as
user-defined signaling output. To obtain reliable results, we
identified 200 collections of combined perturbations (Supplementary File S3) that restored the user-defined signaling
changes in MDA-MB231 cells for the sets of parameters listed
in Supplementary File S2.
The most influential targets were scored according to
the absolute value of the median deviation to the SD ratio
(Supplementary Table S1). The computational analysis
was repeated in triplicate using the same three randomly
selected sets of parameters used to predict individual

inhibition of targeted molecules. Despite being ranked in a
different order, the top five targets were the same for the
three sets. All targets that scored as influential were characterized by a positive median deviation, which indicated
activation of the reactions leading to inhibition of phosphorylated protein. Because p-IGFR, p-IRS-1, p-MEK, pMAPK, and p-AKT were scored as the most influential
targets, combined inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK
pathways was predicted to optimally facilitate disruption
of the loops responsible for aberrant signaling in MDAMB231 cells.
Experimental validation of modeling predictions
The effect of drug combinations on the IGFR network in
the MDA-MB231 cell line. We used immunoblotting to determine whether the combined inhibition of the MAPK and
PI3K/AKT pathways would decrease the levels of p-AKT,
p-MAPK, and p-p70S6K, and minimize changes in phosphorylation of other signaling proteins in the network. We also
tested the combination of MEK and mTOR inhibitors to
determine whether targeting pathways that differ from the
predicted optimal combination would restore user-defined
signaling changes in the MDA-MB231 cells.

p-GSK3, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p-TSC2 detected in the absence
of inhibition, and after 1 hour of incubation with the MEK
and/or PI3K inhibitors in unstimulated cells and IGF-stimulated
cells. The experimental data indicated that, in IGF-stimulated
cells inhibited with MEK and PI3K inhibitors (column 8),
the levels of all phosphorylated proteins were significantly decreased compared with those of the corresponding proteins
detected in noninhibited, IGF-stimulated cells (column 5).
Figure 5A and B show the levels of p-AKT, p-MAPK,
p-GSK3, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p-TSC2 measured in the
absence of inhibition, and after 1 hour of incubation with
the MEK and/or mTOR inhibitors in unstimulated cells and
IGF-stimulated cells. The experimental data indicated that
p-MAPK, p-mTOR, and p-p70S6K levels in IGF-stimulated cells
inhibited with MEK and mTOR inhibitors (column 8) were
decreased compared with those of the corresponding proteins
in noninhibited, IGF-1-stimulated cells (column 5). However,
the p-AKT, p-GSK3, and p-TSC2 levels were increased.
Supplementary Table S2 shows the qualitative comparison
between the measured and predicted differential levels
of phosphorylated proteins in IGF-stimulated cells in the absence of inhibition, and after 1 hour of incubation with MEK
and PI3K inhibitors or MEK and mTOR inhibitors. Note that
the experimental results agree with the modeling predictions
for both drug combinations. Therefore, as predicted by the
mass action model, combined inhibition of the MAPK and
PI3K/AKT pathways optimally inhibited aberrant networks,
but combinations of MEK and mTOR inhibitors did not
decrease the levels of p-AKT, p-MAPK, and p-p70S6K, and
increased phosphorylation of nontargeted protein.

incubated with LY294002 at its EC25 (3.8 μmol/L) or rapamycin at its EC25
(0.1 nmol/L) in combination with U0126 at a concentration of 0.5 to

only with rapamycin at concentrations of 0.1 to 100 nmol/L or with a
combination of U0126 at its EC25 (3.5 μmol/L) and rapamycin at a
concentration of 0.5 to 50 μmol/L. Absorbance was normalized with

viability. To quantify the sensitivity of the MDA-MB231 cell
line to MEK and PI3K, or MEK and mTOR inhibition, we used
cell viability assays.
Figure 6A shows the effect of drug combinations on the
viability of MDA-MB231 cells, which was measured as the
normalized absorbance of viable cells as a function of increasing MEK inhibition (U0126) in combination with PI3K
inhibitor (LY294002) or mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin). The
experimental results indicated that inhibiting cells with a
combination of LY294002 and increasing concentrations of
U0126 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability.
In contrast, cells treated with a combination of rapamycin
and increasing concentrations of U0126 showed no change
in cell proliferation up to 1 μmol/L of U0126 followed by partial rescue of cells with rapamycin. Combined MEK-PI3K

Integrative Identification of Optimal Drug Combinations

inhibition monotonically decreased cell viability, likely as a
result of the optimal inhibition of the signaling pathways that
led to inactivation of phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 4). In contrast, combined MEK-mTOR inhibition increased cell viability at low concentrations of the U0126 inhibitor, likely as a
result of the nonoptimal inhibition of the signaling network
that led to activation of p-AKT (Fig. 5). At high concentrations of the U0126 inhibitor, cell viability was significantly
decreased for both drug combinations, likely as a result of
U0126 inhibitor toxicity (Supplementary Material S3).
To test whether the combination of MEK and mTOR
inhibitors rescued cell proliferation by activation of p-AKT,
we performed cell viability assays with rapamycin alone or
with rapamycin in combination with U2016. The experimental results shown in Fig. 6B indicated that addition of
a MEK inhibitor to cells treated with rapamycin increased
cell viability from 40% to 73% and rescued cells from cell
death. Therefore, the experimental results suggested that
optimal inhibition of aberrant signaling through combined
inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K pathways was correlated
with decreased cell viability. In contrast, nonoptimal combined targeted inhibition led to inadequate inhibition of
the signaling networks and increased cell viability.

Discussion
Integrating mass action modeling with optimization
schemes is a quantitative approach to train ODE models using experimental data and identify optimal drug combinations that can inhibit signaling networks. PSO converged
to more optimal solutions than did other optimization algorithms, including simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.
Supplementary Table S3 summarizes the performance of the
three algorithms in training the reduced mass action model
against time courses of proteins (Supplementary File S4). Each
simulation was repeated three times with different random
seeds of the reduced model unknown parameters.
The most simple and intuitive strategy to inhibit aberrant
networks consists of inhibiting the input sources that trigger
signal transduction. Thus, individual inhibition of IGFR could

restore user-defined pathways in MDA-231 cells. However,
constitutive p-MAPK activation driven by K-Ras and B-Raf
mutations impairs this approach. The experimental results
shown in Figs. 4 and 5, and the computational results shown
in Fig. 3 also suggest that individual inhibition of targeted
molecules frequently does not optimally inhibit cell signaling.
A more effective inhibition of aberrant signaling is accomplished through multiple combined inhibitions of targeted
molecules. The experimental results shown in Figs. 4 to 6 indicate that combined inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT
pathways optimally inhibited the signaling networks and
decreased cell viability. In contrast, combined inhibition of
the MAPK and mTOR cascades led to significant activation
of p-AKT and increased cell viability. Although several other
kinases and pathways may potentially regulate the viability of
the MDA-231 cells, the experimental results indicated that
simultaneous inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways was sufficient to significantly reduce cell proliferation.
In conclusion, we propose a computational procedure that
can be used to rapidly generate experimentally testable intervention strategies that may lead to an optimal use of available drugs and the discovery of novel signaling targets. The
procedure is currently being used to identify and validate
drug combinations that can inhibit aberrant networks in a
panel of human cancer cell lines.
