Abstract
Retinoic acid–induced gene G (RIG-G), a gene originally
identified in all-trans retinoic acid–treated NB4 acute
promyelocytic leukemia cells, is also induced by IFNA in
various hematopoietic and solid tumor cells. Our previous
work showed that RIG-G possessed a potent antiproliferative
activity. However, the mechanism for the transcriptional
regulation of RIG-G gene remains unknown. Here, we report
that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 2
together with IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-9 can effectively
drive the transcription of RIG-G gene by their functional
interaction through a STAT1-independent manner, even
without the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2. The complex
IRF-9/STAT2 is both necessary and sufficient for RIG-G gene
expression. In addition, IRF-1 is also able to induce RIG-G
gene expression through an IRF-9/STAT2–dependent or IRF-9/
STAT2–independent mechanism. Moreover, the induction of
RIG-G by retinoic acid in NB4 cells resulted, to some extent,
from an IFNA autocrine pathway, a finding that suggests a
novel mechanism for the signal cross-talk between IFNA and
retinoic acid. Taken together, our results provide for the first
time the evidence of the biological significance of IRF-9/STAT2
complex, and furnish an alternative pathway modulating the
expression of IFN-stimulated genes, contributing to the diversity of IFN signaling to mediate their multiple biological properties in normal and tumor cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(8):3673–80]

Introduction
The retinoic acid–induced gene G (RIG-G), also known as IFNinducible gene 60, was originally identified in all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA)–treated NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells
(1) and plays an important role in cell growth inhibition through
up-regulation of p21 and p27 (2). RIG-G gene expression can be
induced not only by ATRA along with the differentiation of NB4
cells but also by IFNa in a series of hematopoietic cell lines as well
as various types of solid carcinoma cells (1, 3), which pointed to a
possible role of RIG-G in signal cross-talk between ATRA and IFNa.
However, at present, little is known about the regulation control of
RIG-G gene expression. We previously reported two well-conserved
IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoter region
of RIG-G gene, these two ISREs being likely involved in RIG-G

transcription (2). Besides, some other potential cis-acting elements
for transcription factors [such as CAAT/enhancer binding protein
(C/EBP) and PU.1] have been also noted in the RIG-G gene
promoter. Therefore, the question of what are the transcription
factors essential for RIG-G gene induction remains open.
The first identified multimeric complex to recognize the ISRE
consensus sequence is the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) factor 3
(ISGF3), which is composed of the phosphorylated forms of signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2,
together with IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-9 (4). The IRF-9 protein is
a member of the IRF family characterized by a well-conserved
helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, which can recognize the ISRE.
The mammalian IRF family contains nine members to date, IRF-1
to IRF-9, which have diverse roles in host defense, cell cycle
regulation, apoptosis, oncogenesis, and immune cell development
(5). STAT1 and STAT2 represent two of the seven mammalian STAT
proteins that share several structurally and functionally conserved
domains, including an NH2-terminal coiled-coil region for interactions with other transcription factors and chaperone proteins,
a phosphotyrosine-binding Src homology 2 domain required for
receptor binding and STAT dimerization, and a COOH-terminal
transcription activation domain (TAD) within which a highly
conserved tyrosine residue is present. Importantly, the phosphorylation of this tyrosine allows a functional interaction between
activated STAT proteins (6). The mature ISGF3 complex serves as a
transcriptional regulator in type I IFN signaling pathways by
translocating into the nucleus and then binding to ISRE of certain
ISGs. Noteworthy, it is generally admitted that within the ISGF3
complex, STAT1 and IRF-9 mediate the DNA binding, whereas
STAT2 does not seem to interact directly with DNA but provides a
potent TAD (7).
In addition to the ISGF3, other types of STAT complexes with
IRF-9 can also be formed to bind the ISRE. It was reported that a
complex containing IRF-9 and the phosphorylated STAT1, but
lacking STAT2, could be directed to ISRE-containing genes in
response to IFNg (8, 9). In mature B cells, Gupta and colleagues
(10) found that IFNa was able to activate the formation of an
ISGF3-like complex comprising STAT2, STAT6, and IRF-9. Whereas
IRF-9 functions as an adaptor for tethering the different STAT
dimers to ISRE, other members of IRF family have also been shown
to be involved in the regulation of ISRE-containing genes. It was
shown that IRF-1 could regulate expression of ISGs by directly
binding to ISRE on its own or by dimerizing with other proteins,
including IRF-3, IRF-7, IRF-8, or STAT1 (11–13). Recently,
accumulating observations support the notion that STAT proteins
can drive gene expression without tyrosine phosphorylation
(14–19). It strongly suggests that some not yet identified
mechanisms could exist in gene transcription regulation in
response to these cytokines.

activity was measured 36 h after transfection.

In this work, we intensively explored the mechanisms underlying
the expression regulation of RIG-G gene and found that STAT2,
together with IRF-9, was sufficient for RIG-G expression, even
without the phosphorylation of STAT2, and provided a novel
mechanism modulating the expression of ISGs that accounts for
the signal cross-talk between IFNa and ATRA.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. The NB4 cells (gift from Dr. Lanotte, INSERM
U685, Paris, France) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and
antibiotics. The U3A, U2A, and HT1080 cells were kindly provided by G.R.

DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and
antibiotics. ATRA and cycloheximide (Sigma) were dissolved in ethanol as
stock solution at 10 2 mol/L and 10 mg/mL, respectively, and stored at
20jC. Human IFNa was purchased from Schering-Plough Co. and stored
at 4jC.
Plasmids. The expression constructs for wild-type (wt) STAT1 and
mutant STAT1-Y701F (converting tyrosine 701 to phenylalanine) were
kindly provided by Dr. J.E. Darnell, Jr. (Rockefeller University, New York, NY).
STAT2 full-length cDNA expression plasmid was obtained by subcloning the
insert of pBlueScript-STAT2 ( from Dr. J.E. Darnell, Jr.) to the vector
pcDNA3.1. The mutant STAT2-Y690F (converting tyrosine 690 to phenylalanine) was prepared by Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The luciferasecontaining reporter plasmids pXP2 ( 310) and pXP2 ( 87) were

( 310) by Mutagenesis kit. All the constructs were verified by DNA
sequencing.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen). After reverse transcription, cDNA was amplified under
the following conditions: 94jC for 5 min; 25 cycles of 94jC for 30 s, 58jC
for 45 s, and 70jC for 50 s; and 70jC for 10 min. The primers
5¶-ACCTCGAGACACAGAGGGCAGTC-3¶ and 5¶-ACGGATCCGCCTTGTAGCAGCACCCAATC-3¶ were used to detect RIG-G transcripts. The amplification of b-actin gene was used as an internal control for cDNA loading
with the primers 5¶-CATCCTCACCCTGAAGTACCCC-3¶ and 5¶-AGCCTGGATGCAACGTACATG-3¶.
Western blot analysis. The performance of Western blot and the
generation of rabbit polyclonal anti-RIG-G sera were described in our
previous work (2). Other primary antibodies were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (STAT1, STAT2, IRF-9, and IRF-1), Sigma (h-actin), and Cell
Signaling (pTyr701-STAT1 and pTyr690-STAT2).
Transfection and luciferase reporter assay. The cells were cotransfected with the reporter gene constructs and related expression plasmids as
indicated by using SuperFect (Qiagen) followed by transcriptional activity
assay using Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Ten nanograms pRL-TK vector (Promega) were
used as an internal control for normalizing the transfection efficiency. Data
were shown as means F SD of three independent experiments.
RNA interference. To make small interfering RNA (siRNA) against IRF-1,
19-bp sequence (5¶-CTTCCAGGTGTCACCCATG-3¶) within the coding region
of IRF-1 gene was selected and cloned into the pTER+ vector (22). The
plasmid pTER-si-IRF-1 was then transfected into U3A cells by using
SuperFect.
Coimmunoprecipitation. The expression plasmid encoding green
fluorescent protein (GFP)-IRF-9 hybrid protein was transfected with the
indicated STAT2 constructs into U3A cells. Twelve hours after transfection,
cells were treated with or without IFNa for another 24 h. The protein

extracts were prepared in the buffer containing 150 mmol/L NaCl,
50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.5% NP40 and then mixed with protein
A-agarose and rabbit anti–IRF-9 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at
4jC overnight with rotation. The precipitated proteins were eluted by
boiling beads in SDS-loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed using EZ ChIP kit (Millipore) according
to the instruction of the manufacturer. The primers specific to the promoter
region of RIG-G gene were as follows: 5¶-TGGTGAGTATGGCCTTAGAATT-3¶
and 5¶-TTCCTGTCTGCCTCAAGTAAAT-3¶. Normal rabbit IgG (Millipore)
was used to control the nonspecific immunoprecipitation of chromatin by
immunoglobulins.
Quantitative measurement of human IFNA in medium. The cell
culture supernatant was collected and concentrated if necessary, and then
100 AL aliquots were used for detection with ELISA kit (PBL Biomedical
Laboratories) following the protocol of the manufacturer. The ratio unit/pg
for human IFNa is approximately 3 to 5. Data were shown as means F SD
of three independent experiments.

Results
RIG-G is not a primary target of IFNA-activated ISGF3
complex. By Western blot analysis, we first examined whether the
Janus-activated kinase (JAK)-STAT pathway–activated ISGF3 complex was involved in IFNa-induced RIG-G up-regulation. We found
that in NB4 cells the total amounts of STAT1 and STAT2 continued
to increase throughout the IFNa treatment in parallel with the RIGG induction. In contrast, the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated
STAT1 increased rapidly, peaking at 10 minutes to 1 hour after
IFNa treatment and then returning to the levels characteristic of
untreated cells, whereas the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated

STAT2 followed a similar time course but with a much slower
decline (Fig. 1A). The differential expression kinetics between RIGG and the activated ISGF3 hardly exhibited a possibility that RIG-G
could be a direct target of ISGF3. In addition, no tyrosinephosphorylated STAT1 was detected in NB4 cells treated either by
IFNa for 6 hours or by ATRA for 72 hours (Fig. 1A), further
suggesting that the RIG-G gene expression was most likely
activated through a novel mechanism.
Using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, we questioned whether RIG-G was an IFNa primary responsive gene. In
comparison with the direct transcriptional response of IRF-1 to
IFNa, the RIG-G mRNA induction was entirely blocked by
cycloheximide (Fig. 1B), indicating that the RIG-G was not a
primary responsive gene in IFNa-induced JAK-STAT pathway.
Both IRF-9 and STAT2 are key factors required for RIG-G
expression. We then conducted a survey of transcription factors
essential to the expression of RIG-G. Several IFN signaling pathway–
related key regulators, including STAT1, STAT2, IRF-1, and IRF-9,
were transfected individually or in combination into STAT1-deficient
U3A cells, together with a luciferase reporter gene containing RIG-G
promoter. Consequently, STAT1, STAT2, or IRF-9 alone exhibited no
obvious effect on the reporter gene expression, whereas the
combination of IRF-9 and STAT2 could cooperatively cause an up
to 7-fold induction in luciferase activity, as the IRF-1 alone (Fig. 1C).
Some important factors implicated in myelopoiesis, such as C/EBPs
and PU.1, were also evaluated for their abilities to transactivate the
reporter gene. No significant change was observed when these
expression plasmids were transfected into U3A cells, except that
C/EBPa had a potent repressive activity (data not shown).
We found that enforced expression of STAT1 in U3A cells could
rescue the response of RIG-G gene to IFNa, but mutant STAT1Y701F had no such an effect (Fig. 1C), suggesting that phosphorylation of STAT1 was required for RIG-G expression in IFNa-treated
U3A cells. However, when we coexpressed mutant STAT2-Y690F
with wt STAT1 in U3A cells, IFNa-induced luciferase activity was
effectively inhibited by mutant STAT2-Y690F in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we observed no induction of
luciferase activity in IRF-9–deficient U2A cells after IFNa treatment,
unless the cells were reconstituted by IRF-9 (Fig. 1D). Taken
together, these results provided an indication that IRF-9 and STAT2,
rather than STAT1, were key factors necessary for RIG-G expression.
To investigate how IRF-9 and STAT2 synergistically regulate the
expression of RIG-G gene, we detected whether these two proteins
could interact. Unlike IFNa-activated ISGF3 complex in which
tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT proteins are required, IRF-9 could
successfully interact with either wt STAT2 or mutant STAT2-Y690F
in the absence of IFNa, although the interaction between IRF-9 and
wt STAT2 could be obviously enhanced by IFNa via tyrosine
phosphorylation of STAT2 (Fig. 2A). In agreement with this, both
wt STAT2 and mutant STAT2-Y690F displayed a similar effect on
the luciferase reporter gene expression in U3A cells without IFNa.
By contrast, in IFNa-treated U3A cells, the luciferase activity
showed an additional 7-fold increase by the complex of IRF-9 with
wt STAT2, but not in the case of mutant STAT2-Y690F (Fig. 2B).
Noticeably, no obviously increased binding ability of IRF-9 to
RIG-G promoter was observed in the presence of IFNa after normalizing the amounts of the detected samples according to input
(Fig. 2C).
Dramatic induction of RIG-G by ATRA is related to the IFNA
secretion in NB4 cells. The idea that both STAT2 and IRF-9 were
basic components necessary for RIG-G expression was also

Figure 3. A, IFNa secretion in ATRA-treated NB4 cells. NB4 cells were
treated with or without 1 Amol/L ATRA for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively. The
culture supernatants corresponding to every time point were used for IFNa
concentration quantification. B, U3A cells were cotransfected with STAT2 and
IRF-9. Twelve hours after transfection, the cells were incubated for another
24 h in the culture supernatants of NB4 cells treated with or without ATRA.
The transfected U3A cell extracts were then analyzed by Western blot. Lanes I,
II, III, IV, and V represent U3A cells cultured in the supernatants of NB4 cells
treated with 1 Amol/L ATRA for 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively. The total
STAT2 level was used to control the transfection efficiency. C, U3A cells were
transfected with IRF-1 or empty vector. Thirty-six hours after transfection,
the culture supernatants were collected and used for IFNa titration.

supported by the fact that ATRA could not only induce the total
amounts of STAT2 and IRF-9 proteins but also increase the tyrosine
phosphorylation level of STAT2 in NB4 cells (Fig. 1A). Because ATRA
could cause IFNa synthesis and secretion in NB4 cells by upregulating IRF-1 (23), we thus quantitated the IFNa in culture
supernatant of ATRA-treated NB4 cells. We noted that the IFNa level
was undetectable until the NB4 cells were treated with ATRA for
72 hours when the IFNa titer was f7 pg/mL. After a 96-hour treatment, a further 9-fold increase in IFNa level could be measured
(Fig. 3A).
To test whether the IFNa secreted from ATRA-treated NB4 cells
was able to induce the STAT2 phosphorylation and RIG-G
expression, we incubated the IRF-9/STAT2–cotransfected U3A
cells in the supernatant of ATRA-treated NB4 cells. The results
revealed that the supernatant of 72-hour ATRA-treated NB4 cells
was sufficient to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2

and the endogenous RIG-G level in U3A cells, in comparison
with the relative consistent level of total STAT2 (Fig. 3B). These
data suggested that the effective IFNa secretion might be one
of the causes resulting in RIG-G induction in ATRA-treated NB4
cells.
IRF-1 plays an important role in the modulation of RIG-G
expression. It was noteworthy that IRF-1 alone could significantly
induce the expression of the reporter gene containing RIG-G
promoter (Fig. 1C). To investigate the role of IRF-1 in RIG-G
expression regulation, IRF-1 gene-specific siRNA treatments were
included into the reporter gene assays. Consequently, we found
that si-IRF-1 could significantly reduce IFNa-induced luciferase
activity in STAT1-transfected U3A cells (Fig. 4A), showing that IRF1 was indeed involved in transcriptional activation of RIG-G.
Thus, we tried to better understand the mechanisms by which
IRF-1 induced RIG-G gene expression. An obvious up-regulation of
both STAT2 and IRF-9 proteins was found in HT1080 cells
transfected with IRF-1 (Fig. 4B), implying that the effect of IRF-1
on RIG-G expression might also be attributed to IRF-9 and STAT2.
Moreover, we observed that the transactivity of IRF-9 complexed
with wt STAT2, rather than mutant STAT2-Y690F, could be
enhanced 4-fold more when IRF-1 coexpressed in U3A cells
(Fig. 4C), suggesting a role of IRF-1 on STAT2 phosphorylation.
Whether IRF-1 could also induce the IFNa synthesis as well as the

phosphorylation of STAT2 was then determined. The IFNa level in
the culture supernatant of IRF-1–transfected U3A cells was 3-fold
elevated when compared with control cells (Fig. 3C). Similarly,
increased level of STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation was detected as
well in IRF-1–transfected HT1080 cells (Fig. 4B). Together, these
data indicated that IRF-1 could regulate RIG-G expression through
an IRF-9/STAT2–dependent mechanism.
However, because IRF-1 also has the ability to directly bind the
ISRE elements (24), an IRF-9/STAT2–independent mechanism in
which IRF-1 acted should not be ruled out. This notion was sustained
by the fact that IRF-1 could activate the RIG-G gene promoter in IRF9–deficient U2A cells and by our ChIP assay, confirming the ability of
IRF-1 to bind the RIG-G gene promoter (Fig. 4D). Moreover, we found
that IRF-9 could significantly inhibit the transactivity of IRF-1 in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A), reflecting again their competition
for direct binding with RIG-G promoter.
Two ISRE elements are molecular basis required for RIG-G
expression. Because both IRF-1 and the complex IRF-9/STAT2
could bind the RIG-G gene, we therefore conducted a detailed
functional analysis on RIG-G promoter to precise the molecular
basis for RIG-G expression. Several luciferase reporters with wt or
mutant RIG-G promoters were constructed (Fig. 5B and C): pXP2
( 87) was totally in lack of two ISRE elements; pXP2-mut-1 and
pXP2-mut-2 contained mutations in the site of ISRE I and ISRE II,

respectively; and pXP2-mut-3 possessed double mutations. Our
results showed that both pXP2 ( 87) and pXP2-mut-3 lost all
activities in response to indicated transcription factors. In contrast,
pXP2-mut-1 could significantly reduce the transactivities of both
IRF-9/STAT2 complex and IRF-1, whereas pXP2-mut-2 had no
difference with the wt construct pXP2 ( 310) (Fig. 5D). The similar
results were also obtained in the presence of IFNa. These
observations clearly indicated that the two ISRE sequences in
RIG-G promoter were the molecular basis for RIG-G gene
expression. Notably, it seems that both IRF-9 and IRF-1 preferentially bind the ISRE I.

Discussion
This work intended to identify the transcription factors essential
for RIG-G gene expression. The transcription factors usually
function as homodimers or heterodimers to regulate the gene

expression in eukaryotic cells and their activities are dependent on
distinct protein-protein interaction. In this regard, one of the best
models is IFN-stimulated JAK-STAT pathways, in which both
STAT1 and STAT2 are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in
response to IFNs (4). However, it has become apparent that the
activation of classic JAK-STAT pathways alone cannot account for
the pleiotropic biological effects of IFNs on target cells. Increasing
number of studies show that other types of STAT complexes can be
formed in response to IFNs (7). Several type I IFN-mediated STAT2dependent, but STAT1-independent, mechanisms were reported
(25–30). Because STAT2 is the only member of the STAT family
without DNA-binding activity, it can act as a transcription factor
only when complexed to other STATs or proteins (31). Two
independent reports have pointed the existence of a complex
composed of STAT2 homodimers and IRF-9 without STAT1 in
IFNa-treated cells (32, 33), but this finding was tempered by the
facts that their authors mentioned that this complex displayed only

limited DNA-binding affinity for an ISRE sequence. Therefore, for a
long time, the biological significance of IRF-9/STAT2 complex has
been difficult to assess.
In this study, we provide the first evidence that in STAT1-deficient
U3A cells, STAT2 forms a complex with IRF-9 on the ISRE regions of
RIG-G promoter and effectively mediates the transcription of RIG-G
gene, even without the tyrosine phosphorylation. Because IFNa
failed to induce RIG-G expression in STAT1-deficient U3A cells
unless the cells were transfected with exogenous STAT1, we
previously concluded that STAT1 was a prerequisite to RIG-G
expression. However, our conclusion no longer proved exact
because of our following new findings. First, mutant STAT2-Y690F
could exert a dominant-negative effect in STAT1-reconstituted U3A
cells in the presence of IFNa (Fig. 1C). Second, in IRF-9–deficient
U2A cells, IFNa-induced luciferase activity was detected only when
enforcing IRF-9 expression in these cells (Fig. 1D). Third, ectopic
overexpression of wt STAT1 in U3A cells was unable to induce the
reporter gene expression without IFNa, whereas mutant STAT1Y701F remained responseless even under IFNa treatment (Fig. 1C),
indicating that STAT1 activity depended on its phosphorylation.
Taken together, data are currently convincing that STAT1 alone is
not sufficient for the expression of RIG-G gene. The primary
function of exogenous STAT1 transfected into U3A cells might be to
restore the JAK-STAT pathways through which the downstream
genes, including IRF-1, IRF-9, STAT2, and RIG-G, can be directly or
indirectly induced (Fig. 6).
During the past decade, data on the putative roles of STAT
proteins in mediating gene expression without tyrosine phosphorylation have been accumulating. For example, a complex of
unphosphorylated STAT1 and IRF-1 was found to support the
constitutive expression of low molecular mass polypeptide 2 gene
coding for a subunit of 20S proteasome (15). Unphosphorylated
STAT3 could drive overexpressions of certain oncogenes (such as
M-RAS and MET), which contributed to cellular transformation
(34). Similarly, unphosphorylated STAT6 was shown to be able to
cooperate with p300 to enhance cyclooxygenase-2 gene expression
in human non–small cell lung cancer (16). Here, we have shown for
the first time that the unphosphorylated STAT2 could play an
important role in RIG-G gene expression by interacting with IRF-9,
further reinforcing the idea that STAT proteins could function as
transcription factors in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation.
Interestingly, it was reported that unphosphorylated STAT2 was
not static but dynamically shuttling between the nucleus and
cytoplasm (31, 35, 36). The nuclear import of unphosphorylated
STAT2 depended on its association with IRF-9, which contained a
constitutive nuclear localization signal (35). These findings offer no
doubt a prerequisite for the transactivation potential of unphosphorylated STAT2 on RIG-G expression.
Another interesting question addressed by our investigation is
how ATRA can induce RIG-G expression in NB4 cells. In addition
that ATRA greatly increases the protein level of both STAT2 and
IRF-9, IFNa synthesis and secretion in NB4 cells after ATRA
treatment for 72 hours and onward strongly suggests that ATRAinduced RIG-G may represent one of the key molecular nodes of
cross-talk between ATRA and IFNa. This idea is supported by the
finding that the lack of IFNa synthesis in ATRA-resistant NB4-R1
cells is exquisitely coincident with no induction of RIG-G by ATRA
in these cells (data not shown). Recently, some other cytokines
(such as tumor necrosis factor) or chemical drugs were also found
to up-regulate several IFN-inducible gene family members
(including RIG-G) through production of type I IFNs (37, 38),

further indicating that the induction of RIG-G by ATRA in NB4 cells
was tightly related with an IFNa autocrine pathway.
In summary, we propose here a novel mechanism for the
transcriptional regulation of RIG-G, an IFNa-induced gene. As
shown in Fig. 6, the binding of IFNa to its cognate receptors
activates the classic JAK-STAT pathway, which is required to
initiate the transcription of a set of primary target genes, such as
IRF-1. The expression of unphosphorylated STAT2 and IRF-9 is
greatly increased in response to IFNa probably through an indirect
manner. STAT2 interacts with IRF-9 to form a transcription factor
complex, which is both necessary and sufficient to transactivate
the expression of RIG-G gene. On the other hand, IRF-1 can also
induce RIG-G gene expression through an IRF-9/STAT2–dependent
or IRF-9/STAT2–independent mechanism. In NB4 cells, ATRA can
up-regulate IRF-1, which was followed by the production and
secretion of IFNa. Accordingly, the induction of RIG-G by ATRA is

Figure 6. Schematic illustration of signaling pathways on IFNa- or
ATRA-induced RIG-G expression in NB4 cells. Through binding cell surface
receptors [IFN receptor (IFNR )], IFNa activates classic JAK-STAT pathway,
which in turn leads to the formation of ISGF3 complex. The ISGF3 then
translocates to the nucleus and initiates the transcription of IFNa target genes,
such as IRF-1 . IRF-1 can largely increase the expression of STAT2 and IRF-9,
which form a functional complex to drive the expression of RIG-G gene.
The phosphorylation of STAT2 can greatly enhance the transactivities of the
complex IRF-9/STAT2. In addition, IRF-1 itself can also recognize the ISRE
sequences and directly bind RIG-G promoter to induce RIG-G gene expression.
ATRA has been generally known to exert its roles through their nuclear
receptors. In NB4 cells, ATRA can induce IRF-1, which is a transcriptional
activator of IFNa expression, suggesting that ATRA may induce the RIG-G
gene expression through an IFNa autocrine pathway.

also related to IFNa (Fig. 6). Our work deciphered the signal
cross-talk between ATRA and IFNa in APL NB4 cells, but our
finding should have broader implications in cancer. We furnished
here an alternative pathway for the diversity of IFN signaling to
mediate its multiple biological properties in normal and tumor
cells.
