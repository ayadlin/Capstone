ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable cancer characterized by clonal expansion
of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow and their egress into peripheral blood.
The mechanisms of myeloma cells migration/invasion have remained unclear. Herein,
we found SH3GL3 was highly expressed in the CD138-negative (CD138−) myeloma
cells. The migration/invasion capability of CD138− cells was significantly higher than
that in the CD138-positive (CD138+) cells. Silencing SH3GL3 using shRNA reduced
myeloma cells migration/invasion. Conversely, overexpression of SH3GL3 increased
myeloma cells migration/invasion. Moreover, SH3GL3 is also associated with the
stemness and chemo-resistance of CD138− myeloma cells. Elevated expression of
stem cell and multi-drug resistant markers were seen in the myeloma cells with
overexpressed SH3GL3; while knocking-down SH3GL3 reduced the expression of
these markers. A marked increase in p-PI3K and p-FAK was observed in the cells
with overexpressed SH3GL3. To test if FAK/PI3K signaling pathway was involved in
the SH3GL3-mediated myeloma cells migration, the cells transfected w/wo SH3GL3
cDNA were treated with FAK inhibitor 14 and PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Inhibition of
FAK and PI3K attenuated SH3GL3-mediated migration /invasion. Our findings indicate
that SH3GL3 plays an important role in myeloma cell migration/invasion, stemness
and chemo-resistance. The SH3GL3-mediated myeloma cell migration/invasion is
mediated by FAK/PI3K signaling pathway.

INTRODUCTION

multiple myeloma cells lacked the expression of plasma
cell marker CD138 [6] were enriched in CD138− CD19−
CD38++ plasma cells, while CD19+ B cells never formed
MM colonies [7]. In contrast, Matsui et al. [4] found that
CD138− CD19+ CD27+ cells isolated from the peripheral
blood of MM patients were able to engraft in the NOD/
SCID mice and generate mature CD138+ myeloma cells.
Myeloma cell migration is very important for myeloma
cell invasion and dissemination. However, the mechanism
regulating cell migration remains unclear. Myeloma cells
are thought to enter blood vessels in the periphery and then
migrate to the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment by
extravasting from the vascular endothelium. The interaction
between myeloma cells and BM stromal cells promotes
myeloma cell migration to secondary sites in the BM [8].
Studies have found that circulating malignant plasma cells
were present in more than 70% of MM patients [4, 9].

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most
prevalent hematologic malignancy. It is characterized by
the clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells [1] and
remains largely incurable in spite of the advent of several
therapeutic strategies [2]. The clinical outcomes of MM
patients are extremely heterogeneous, with survival ranging
from several months to more than 15 years [3]. Even if
MM patients may reach a complete remission initially with
currently available chemo- and radio-therapy, most MM
patients eventually developed relapsed disease after several
years. A number of studies have suggested that a small
fraction of cells responsible for disease relapse is capable
of clonogenic growth and resistant to the therapeutic drugs
[4, 5]. This subpopulation is termed as multiple myeloma
stem cells [4, 5]. Recent studies indicated that clonogenic

A number of studies have shown that several proteins
participate in the migration of myeloma cells, such as insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1) [10, 11], stromal cell-derived
factor-1α [12], wingless-ints (Wnt) [8], and integrin β-7
[13]. However, the complexity of migration process makes it
likely that other molecules may also play critical roles.
In order to characterize the differences between
CD138-positive and CD138-negtive cells, Yang et al.
[14] performed gene expression profiling analysis and
identified that a group of genes were upregulated in
CD138− subgroup, including mammalian SH3-domain
GRB2-like 3 (SH3GL3). The mammalian SH3GL3 is
also known as endophilin A3 and extra eleven nineteen
(EEN)-B2, and belongs to a small family of SH3 domain
containing proteins [15]. Endophilins contain a Bin/
Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain, a variable region
and an SH3 domain [15]. The BAR domain protein
superfamily are important for cellular traffic. SH3
domains play critical roles in protein-protein interaction
and are involved in signal transduction processes, such
as the regulation of cancer cell migration/invasion and
adhesion [16, 17]. Endophilins also play important roles in
receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, mitochondrial network
dynamics, and synaptic vesicles retrieval [15].
Previous studies have shown that SH3GL3/
endophilin A3 is associated with the adaptor protein Cb1interacting protein of 85K (CIN 85). Ubiquitin ligase
Cb1 recruits endophilin-CIN85 complex to mediate the
internalization of receptor tyrosine kinases [18]. SH3GL3 is
preferentially expressed in mammalian brain and testes, and
can interact with Huntingtin exon 1 protein, dynamin, and
synaptojanin [19]. Delic et al. [20] found that SH3GL3 was
involved in glioma cell invasion and silence of SH3GL3
resulted in a reduction in the cumulative activity of matrix
metalloproteins in these cells. To date, the specific function
of SH3GL3 in cancer has yet to be addressed.
SH3GL3-associated signaling pathways are still
poorly understood. A few of studies have focused on
the role of endophilins in endocytosis. Aramaki et al.
found that SH3GL3/endophilin A3 interacted directly
with metastasis-associated protein 1 [21]. Endophilin3-interacting protein 1 contains numerous SH3-domain
binding sites, and it functions as an endocytic protein
that affects energy homeostasis via its interaction with
endophilins [22]. Endophilin A1 can be phosphorylated
by Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and leads to
a reduction in EGFR endocytosis [23]. Phosphorylation
of Endophilin A2 by a FAK/Src complex inhibited
endophilin/dynamin interactions and abrogates endocytosis
of MT1-MMP [17]. The interaction of Ataxin 2 with
endophilin A1/A3, adaptor protein CIN85, and ubiquitin
ligase c-CbI regulates endocytic receptor cycling [24]. The
role of SH3GL3 in MM has not been investigated.
In this study, we found that CD138− myeloma stemlike cells had a higher migration and invasion capability.
SH3GL3 was highly expressed in CD138− myeloma cells.

Knocking-down SH3GL3 using shRNA reduced myeloma
cell migration and invasion and decreased the stemness
and chemo-resistance. In contrast, overexpression of
SH3GL3 increased myeloma cell migration/invasion and
enhanced the stemness and chemo-resistance of myeloma
stem cells. Activation of FAK and PI3K were required
for SH3GL3-increased myeloma cell migration/invasion.
Inhibition of FAK or PI3K attenuated SH3GL3-enhanced
cell migration. Taken together, these findings reveal, at
the first time, that the SH3GL3-induced cell migration/
invasion is mediated by FAK/PI3K signaling pathway.

RESULTS
Characterization of CD138- isolated from U266
myeloma cells
CD138+ and CD138− cells were isolated from U266
myeloma cells using autoMACS and CD138 microbeads.
CD138− cells account about 3–4% of the total number of
cells. Oct4, Lin28A, Nanog and Sox-2 are pluripotencyassociated transcription factors that maintain the selfrenewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. We
measured the expression of Lin28A, Nanog, OCT4, and
Sox2 in the CD138+ and CD138− cells using qRT-PCR. As
shown in the Figure 1A, these genes were highly expressed
in the CD138− U266 myeloma cells, when compared
with that in the CD138+ cells. The expressions of stem
markers were also determined in other three myeloma cell
lines (Supplementary Figure S2). It is known that clone
formation ability reflects a self-renewal capacity, which
is a characteristic of tumor stem cells. To examine the
clonogenic capacity of both subpopulations, we carried
out the soft agar clonogenic assay. As shown in the
Figure 1B, CD138− cells had a higher clonogenic capacity
than that in the CD138+ subpopulation. CD138− cells from
other three cell lines also displayed higher clonogenic
capacity (Supplementary Figure S3). We also measured
the sensitivity of both subpopulations to the therapeutic
drug Bortezomib (BTZ). The CD138+ and CD138− cells
were treated with 0–10 µM BTZ for 72 hours, and cell
viability was determined using MTT assay. As shown in the
Figure 1C, the treatment CD138+ cells with 2, 5 and 10 µM
BTZ led to 16%, 51% and 54% reduction in cell viability,
respectively, when compared to non-treated controls. In
contrast, CD138− cells were resistant to BTZ treatment.
Incubating CD138− cells with 0–10 μM BTZ for 72 h
failed to affect cell viability (Figure 1D). Taken together,
these results have demonstrated that CD138− cells have the
properties of stem cells and are resistant to BTZ treatment.

CD138− cells exhibit a higher migration/invasion
capability
To evaluate the migration/invasion capacity of
CD138− and CD138+ cells, we measured cell migration

and invasion using transwell assay. Comparing with the
CD138+ cells, we observed a more than two-fold increase
in the number of CD138− cells migrated into the lower
chamber (Figure 1E). Cell invasion was measured by
assessing the migration of cells through matrigel-coated
transwell filters overnight. Similarly, the number of
CD138− cells invaded through matrigel was more than
twice as much as the CD138+ cells (Figure 1F). Our data
indicates that CD138− cells have a higher migration and
invasion capability.

the Figure 2F, knocking-down SH3GL3 led to a significant
reduction in the number of migrated cells, when compared
with the cells infected with scrambled shRNA lentiviral
particles. The number of invading cells was also reduced
significantly (Figure 2G). Thus, knocking-down SH3GL3
appears to play a critcal role in decreasing myeloma cell
migration and invasion.

Overexpression of SH3GL3 enhances migration
and invasion of myeloma cells

We then sought to determine the signaling pathways
involving in the SH3GL3-activated migration of myeloma
cells. Previous studies have reported the signaling pathways
involved in the regulation of myeloma cell migration
[8, 10–13]. The focal adhesion kinase p125 (FAK) is a
cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and plays an important role in
cell migration [25]. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3Ks)
are a large family of lipid enzymes that can phosphorylate
the 3′-OH group of phosphatidylinositol on the plasma
membrane [26]. A study has demonstrated that the PI3K
signaling pathway is involved in many different cellular
processes such as motility, metabolism, cell survival and
cell progression [27]. Recent results have indicated that the
FAK and PI3K were involved in the migration of myeloma
cells [10]. We, therefore, assessed the status of FAK
activation in myeloma cells with overexpressed or silenced
SH3GL3. As shown in Figure 3A, knocking-down SH3GL3
led to a significant reduction in the phosphorylated FAK
protein level. In contrast, overexpression of SH3GL3
remarkably enhanced the phosphorylation of FAK
(Figure 3B). We also analyzed the phosphorylated protein
level of p85-PI3K. A similar pattern of changes in the
phosphorylated protein levels of p85-PI3K was observed
in the myeloma cells with reduced- or over- expression of
SH3GL3 (Figure 3C and 3D).
Our data has shown that SH3GL3 regulated
the activation status of FAK and p85-PI3K. Here, we
investigated if the SH3GL3-activated cell migration and
invasion were regulated through FAK/PI3K signaling. The
cells infected with SH3GL3 shRNA or cDNA lentiviral
particles were treated with either 10 µM FAK inhibitor
(FAK inhibitor 14) or 50 µM PI3K inhibitor LY294002 for
1 h prior to seeding onto the transwell inserts. Figure 3E
and 3F show that preincubation of cells with FAK inhibitor
14 abolished the SH3GL3-promoted cell migration
and invasion. Inhibition of PI3K using LY294002 also
abrogated SH3GL3-induced migration and invasion in
myeloma cells (Figure 3G and 3H). These results indicated
that FAK and PI3K were key mediators in the SH3GL3activated myeloma cell migration and invasion.
To determine the effect of FAK on the downstream
signaling proteins, U266 cells were treated with FAK
inhibitor and the related proteins were analyzed using
western blotting. As shown in the Figure 4A, inhibition
of FAK resulted reduction in the protein levels of p-PI3K,

Molecular mechanisms regulating MM cells
migration induced by SH3GL3

The microarray analysis from Yang et al. [14]
suggests that CD138+ and CD138− cells have distinct gene
expression profiles. We measured the mRNA levels of
several genes in CD138+ and CD138− U266 cells using
qRT-PCR. We found that SH3GL3 was highly expressed
in the CD138− cells, and verified the protein level using
western blotting in CD138+ and CD138-cells as shown in
the Figure 2A. To test if SH3GL3 plays a role in myeloma
cell migration and invasion, we first overexpressed
SH3GL3 in a myeloma cell line. Human H929 myeloma
cells expressed a relative low level of SH3GL3. We
overexpressed SH3GL3 in this cell line. H929 cells
were infected with lentiviral particles containing cDNA
construct or empty vector. The mRNA and protein levels
of SH3GL3 were determined using qRT-PCR and western
blotting, respectively. A 3.8 fold increase of SH3GL3
mRNA level was seen in the SH3GL3 cDNA-infected
cells, compared with the cells infected with empty vector
(Figure 2B, bottom). The protein level of SH3GL3 was
also increased in the SH3GL3 cDNA-infected cells
(Figure 2B, top). H929 cell infected with SH3GL3 cDNA
or empty vector were plated into the transwell inserts and
the cells invaded into the bottom of the filter were counted.
Overexpression of SH3GL3 resulted in a 3-fold increase
in cell migration (Figure 2C). The number of cells invaded
through the bottom of the matrigel membrane were also
significantly elevated (Figure 2D). Our data indicated
that overexpression of SH3GL3 enhanced migration and
invasion of myeloma cells.

Knocking-down SH3GL3 leads to a significant
reduction in cell migration and invasion
To further confirm the role of SH3GL3 in regulating
myeloma cell migration and invasion, we knocked down
the expression of SH3GL3 using SH3GL3 shRNA in U266
cells. U266 myeloma cells were infected with SH3GL3
shRNA lentiviral particles. As shown in the Figure 2E,
infection of cells with SH3GL3 shRNA resulted in a ~80%
reduction in SH3GL3 expression, determined using qRTPCR (Figure 2E, bottom). The protein level of SH3GL3
was also markedly reduced (Figure 2E, top). As shown in

p-Src, p-RhoA, p-ROCK1and p-P38. We didn’t see any
changes on other signaling molecules, such as ERK and
AKT (data not shown). Our data indicated that PI3K, Src,
RhoA, ROCK1 and P38 are involved in the FAK signaling.
To determine the effect of SH3GL3 on FAK signaling
pathway, the total and phosphorylated protein levels
in the cells with infected shRNA or cDNA of SH3GL3
were compared with the non-infected counterparts. As
shown in the Figure 4B, knocking-down SH3GL3 led to
a reduction in the protein levels of p-Src, p-RhoA, p-P38
and p-ROCK1. Conversely, overexpression of SH3GL3
enhanced the activation of these proteins (Figure 4C).
Based on the results that we obtained above and
the published signaling pathways for FAK, we proposed
a potential mechanism associated with the SH3GL3activated migration and invasion in the myeloma cells as
shown in the Figure 5.

of these stem cell markers (Figure 6B). No changes were
observed in the expression of Lin28A in the cells with
either overexpressed or silenced SH3GL3, when compared
with their corresponding controls (data not shown). We
also investigated the involvement of SH3GL3 in drug
resistance. We measured the expression of multi-drug
resistant markers, including multi-drug resistant protein
3 (ABCC3) and ATP-Binding Cassette Sub-Family B
Member 1 (ABCB1). As shown in the Figure 6C and 6D,
the expression of ABCC3 and ABCB1 were remarkably
increased in the cells with overexpressed SH3GL3
(Figure  6C), and significantly reduced in the SH3GL3silenced U266 cells (Figure 6D). We subsequently
examined the response of cells to BTZ. Myeloma cells
infected with lentiviral particles containing SH3GL3
cDNA, shRNA or vectors were incubated with 5 nM BTZ
for 72 h and cell viability was determined using MTT
assay. Interestingly, overexpression of SH3GL3 resulted in
an increase in cell viability when compared with the cells
infected with empty vectors (Figure 6E). In contrast, the
cells infected with SH3GL3 shRNA showed a reduction
in cell viability compared with the scrambled control
(Figure 6F). We also determined the role of SH3GL3 in
cell response to melphalan and lenalidomide. U266 cells
infected with SH3GL3 or scrambled shRNA were treated
with 5 µM melphalan or 10 µM lenalidomide for 72 h,
respectively. Knocking-down SH3GL3 sensitized the U266
cells to melphalan, but not lenalidomide (Supplementary
Figure S4). Taken together, these results suggest that
SH3GL3 plays a potential role in the stemness and drug
resistance of myeloma cells to BTZ and melphalan.

Overexpression of SH3GL3 promotes myeloma
cell stemness and enhances the expression of
drug-resistant proteins
To test whether SH3GL3 was indeed the driver
rather than an associated phenomenon of stem cell features
and drug resistance, we measured the expression of stem
cell markers (Nanog, OCT4, Sox2 and Lin28A) in the
H929 cells infected with SH3GL3 cDNA and empty
vector using qRT-PCR. Overexpression of SH3GL3 led
to a marked increase in the expression of Nanog, OCT4
and Sox2, respectively (Figure 6A). In contrast, knockingdown SH3GL3 using shRNA suppressed the expression

DISCUSSION

Though much progress in investigating clonogenic
myeloma progenitor cells has been made, it is still
debated whether CD138− cells are myeloma stem cells.
In our study, we isolated CD138− cells from myeloma
cell line U266, NCI H929, RPMI8226, and MM1.S
using autoMACS separator and CD138 microbeads,
and measured the expression of stem cell markers and
their clonogenic ability. We found that the CD138− cells
isolated from U266 cell line expressed a high level
of Lin28A, Nanog, OCT4, and Sox2, and had a higher
clonogenic potential compared with the CD138+ cells.
The CD138− cells isolated from other myeloma cell lines
had also higher clonogenic potential. CD138− U266
myeloma cells were resistant to the BTZ. Furthermore, it
has been reported that CD138− cells could initiate tumor
development and differentiate into CD138+ cells in vivo
[31]. Moreover, CD138− cells from a murine model of
MM are quiescent and most invasive [32]. In our study, we
also found that CD138− cells exhibited a stronger invasion
capability than CD138+ cells in vitro. Previous studies and
our data suggest that CD138− clonogenic myeloma cells
are myeloma stem cells with high migration potential.
We have demonstrated the distinct expression of
SH3GL3 in CD138− and CD138+ U266 myeloma cells

Most tumors are hierarchically organized and
sustained by a subset of clonogenic cells that have selfrenewal potentials. These clonogenic cells can grow
clonally into tumors and have potential to metastasize
to other sites. Disease relapse indicates that the cells
responsible for tumor regrowth are relatively drug resistant.
Recent studies indicate that multiple myeloma contains
heterogeneous cell types with different clonogenic potential
[6]. The clonogenic myeloma cells exhibit properties
of stem cells and are resistant to drug treatment [4, 28].
CD138 is expressed in malignant and normal plasma cells,
but not on virgin/ naive B cells, memory B cells, T cells, or
monocytes [29]. Previous studies have shown that human
myeloma cell lines and clinical specimens consist of only a
minority of cells that lacked CD138 expression [6]. These
CD138− cells display more clonogenic potential in vitro
and in vivo than CD138+ plasma cells and exhibit stem cell
properties [4, 30]. In the past several years, many efforts
have been focused on clonogenic myeloma cells and their
roles in myeloma initiation and relapse [6, 14]. However,
the exact mechanism and their functional roles in the
disease process are yet to be elucidated.

genes in the CD138+ and CD138− U266 cells was determined using qRT-RCR (lower panel). SH3GL3 was highly expressed in CD138−

consistent with the data from microarray analysis [14].
Paino et al. [33] reported that CD138++ and CD138low
have similar gene expression and genomic profiles.
There are two differences between their study and ours.
First, the isolation method they used was different from
the one we used. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
was used by Paino et al., and autoMACS separator plus
CD138 microbeads was used in our laboratory. Second,
they analyzed CD138++ and CD138low, but we analyzed
CD138+ and CD138−. Because CD138− cells only account
for a small subpopulation, it is more difficult to obtain
enough CD138− cells from MM patients. Therefore,
gene profiling analysis using microarray has not shown
a differential expression of SH3GL3 in the human MM
specimen compared to the health control [34]. Delic et al.
reported that SH3GL3 regulated glioma cell invasion, and
knocking-down SH3GL3 reduced the activity of matrix
metalloproteinase [20]. Iwakaki et al. [16] found that SH3
domains were critical to protein-protein interaction and
regulated signal transduction process, such as cancer cell
invasion. In our study, we found that increased numbers of
cells migrated into the lower chamber when SH3GL3 was
overexpressed, while few cells in the lower chamber when
SH3GL3 was silenced. Our data suggest that SH3GL3
plays an important role in migration and invasion of
myeloma cells.

Most of myeloma therapies take advantage of
the key features of malignant myeloma cells, such
as fast proliferation rate and sensitivity to certain
therapeutic drugs, or disrupting signaling pathways
and microenvironments required for the survival of
terminally differentiated myeloma cells. The combined
chemotherapies have led to clinical improvement of MM
patients. However, these therapies cannot successfully
eradicate all of the cancer cells in most of the patients,
because of the existence of myeloma stem cells. In this
study, we have demonstrated that SH3GL3 enhanced the
stemness of myeloma cells. Overexpression of SH3GL3
in the myeloma cells induced the specific characteristics
of stem cells, including the enhanced expression of
prototypical stem cell genes and drug resistant genes.
These cells were also resistant to BTZ treatment. The
opposite effect was observed while SH3GL3 was silenced.
These findings indicate that SH3GL3 appears to be an
important player in maintaining myeloma stem cell
features.
Cell migration plays crucial roles in cancer
progression [35]. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a
non-receptor kinase that plays critical roles in a variety of
biological processes [36]. In the recent years, numerous
studies have explored the role of FAK in various cancers
[37–39]. FAK−/− embryonic fibroblasts exhibited profound

in the cells infected with SH3GL3 shRNA (C) or cDNA (D) lentiviral particles. (E–F) H929 cells infected with SH3GL3 cDNA lentiviral
particles were pretreated with FAK inhibitor 14 (10 µM) for 1 hour and then cells were loaded into the insert in 300 µL of serum-free
RPMI 1640 medium. After 24 hours incubation at 37°C, the cells in the lower chamber were counted. The relative migration was shown
(E) and the relative invasion was shown (F). (G–H) H929 cells infected with SH3GL3 cDNA lentiviral particles were pretreated with PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 (50 µM) for 1 hour and then cells were loaded into the insert in 300 µL of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. After 24
hours incubation at 37°C, the cells in the lower chamber were counted. The relative migration was shown (G) and the relative invasion was
shown (H). The relative value was calculated as the ratio of the number of treated cells and the number of vector control. The results are
representative of 3 independent experiments and shown as mean ± SE, **p < 0.01.

defects in migration in vivo, suggesting the role of FAK
in promoting cell migration [40]. In the present study,
we found that the activation of FAK was stimulated by
SH3GL3. Several FAK downstream signaling pathways
have been known to involve in FAK-activated cell
migration. Previous studies indicated that the FAK/
PI3K signaling pathway plays important roles in the
regulation of cell migration [41, 42]. Reiske et al. found
that PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) inhibited FAK-promoted
migration in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [41].
Our data showed that FAK inhibitor was able to suppress
the activity of PI3K. Moreover, inhibition of FAK or
PI3K reduced SH3GL3-activated cell migration and
invasion. FAK can also increase cell migration through
other pathways. Phosphorylation of FAK at Y397 creates
a binding site for the SH2 domain of Src and triggers
the complex formation of FAK-Src [43]. The FAK-Src
complex can control cell shape, focal contact turnover
and generation of traction forces events [44, 45]. Our

results showed that FAK inhibition led to a significant
inhibition of phosphorylated Src in the myeloma cells. It
was reported that FAK overexpression could promote the
p190RhoGEF (a ubiquitously expressed RhoA-specific
GEF) tyrosine phosphorylation in Neuro-2a cells, which
is associated with the enhanced activity of p21 RhoA.
This event contributes to the regulation of cell migration
[46, 47]. ROCK, a downstream effector of RhoA, is also
involved in cell migration [48]. RhoA/ROCK signaling
pathway plays a crucial role in FAK activation. Therefore,
we investigated the RhoA and ROCK as the downstream
pathway of FAK. In our studies, the results showed that
treating cells with FAK inhibitor reduced the protein
levels of phosphorylated RhoA and ROCK, suggesting
that they are the downstream signaling molecules of FAK.
Additionally, we measured the activation of P38, Akt, and
Erk. The activation of P38 was regulated by SH3GL3. Akt
is the downstream signaling molecules of PI3K, so we
also tested the status of Akt. No significant changes in the

p-Akt was observed. Although Akt is viewed as a major
downstream effector of PI3K, at least in physiological
processes, several previous studies suggest that PI3K and
Akt act independently of each other in cancers [49–52].
Recent studies have reported that Erk plays crucial roles
in cell migration [53, 54]. This protein was also detected
in our study, and no significant changes in the p-Erk was
observed. Our results showed that Akt and Erk were
not involved in the SH3GL3-activiated cell migration.
Based on our findings, we proposed a mechanism for the
SH3GL3-promoted migration and invasion in myeloma
cells as shown in the Figure 5. Our study indicates that
SH3GL3-activated myeloma cell migration/invasion
is regulated through the activation of FAK signaling
pathways. Our current in vitro findings cannot be
simply extrapolated to in vivo conditions. Therefore,
in vitro observations need to be further confirmed using
appropriate animal models to support the potential
importance of SH3GL3 and related signaling molecules.
It is very important to target clonogenic myeloma
cells, which are thought to be responsible for disease
process and maintenance of MM [6]. Therapies against
terminally differentiated plasma cells may lead to
immediate clinical effects. The resistant stem cells
may escape from the treatments. Therefore, selectively
targeting myeloma stem cells could be prematurely
abandoned. In summary, our findings provide the evidence
of molecular mechanisms underlying the migration/
invasion of myeloma stem cells and offer potential
insights into pathways that can be selectively targeted for
the treatment of malignant MM disease. SH3GL3 may
represent an attractive target for future research.

CD138− portion. The magnetically labeled CD138+ cells were
retained within the column and flushed out using 500 µL
incubation buffers. The purity of isolated CD138− cells was
more than 94% (Supplementary Figure S1).

Clonogenic formation assay
Colony formation was performed as described
in [14]. Briefly, 5,000 myeloma cells were suspended
in 0.35% agarose in 2× complete RPMI medium. The
suspensions were placed onto a solidified base layer with
0.5% agarose in 2× complete medium in a 6-well plate.
The cells were cultured for three weeks and fresh medium
was added to the culture plate every 3–4 days. All plates
were imaged and colony numbers counted using Image
J software. Only colonies containing more than 50 cells
were scored.

Lentiviral vector construction for SH3GL3
shRNA
To determine the role of SH3GL3 in regulating
myeloma cell migration and invasion, SH3GL3 shRNA
and scramble sequences were designed using Invitrogen
online shRNA software (http://www.sirnawizard.com/
siRNA.php, Supplementary Table S1) and cloned into the
pLVTHM vector. The constructs were then co-transfected
with psPAX2 and PMD2G into 293T packing cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA). After 48 hours, the packaged virus was
collected and stored at −80°C until use. The SH3GL3expressing lentiviral particles were obtained from
GeneCopoeia (Rockville, MD). Myeloma cells were
infected with SH3GL3 shRNA or SH3GL3-expressing
particles in the presence of 8 µg/mL polybrene. The
efficiency of SH3GL3 silence and overexpression in the
myeloma cells were monitored by qRT-PCR and western
blotting. The sequence 1 of shRNA got good results, and
this shRNA was used in following assays.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The human myeloma cell lines U266 and H929
were purchased from the American Tissue Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA), and cultured in RPMI 1640
medium (Thermo Scientific, Logan, UT) containing 10%
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 37°C
in humidified 5% CO2.

Real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from myeloma cells using
an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA was
synthesized using the SuperScript III RT kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR)
reactions were carried out on the 7500 Fast Real-time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Briefly, qPCR amplification was performed with 100 ng
of cDNA in a 20 μL reaction mixture containing 10 µL 2×
All-in-OneTM qPCR mix (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD),
300 nM of upstream and downstream primers and nuclearfree water. PCR reaction was conducted with 1 cycle at
95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C
for 1 min, followed by dissociation curve analysis. The

CD138+ and CD138− cell isolation
CD138+ and CD138− myeloma cells were isolated
using autoMACS separator and CD138 microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 2 × 107 cells were
incubated with 40 µL of CD138 microbeads for 15 min at
4°C and resuspended with 500 µL incubation buffer. The
cells were then transferred into a separation column, which
was placed in a magnetic field in the autoMACS separator.
The cells passing through the column were collected as

Organics, Thermo Fisher Scientific, New Jersey) method
as described previously [55]. Briefly, 5000 cells /well were
plated in 96-well plates and incubated overnight. The cells
were treated w/wo bortezomib (various concentration
0.5~10 nM), melphalan (5 µM) and lenalidomide (10 µM)
for 72 hours. Then 12.5 µL of 5 mg/mL MTT reagent in
PBS was added to each well and incubated for 4 hours in
a CO2 incubator. Cells were then lysed by adding 50 µL
lysis buffer (20% SDS, 50% N, N, N-dimethyl formamide
(DMF), PH4.7) at 37°C. The absorbance at 560 nm was
measured using a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA).

Western blotting
Myeloma cells were lysed with 1 X RIPA buffer
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and
stored in aliquots at −20°C until use. Twenty micrograms
of cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of
Laemmli sample buffer, denatured by boiling, and
separated by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were
then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad,
Hercules, CA). The membranes were blocked using 5%
non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and probed
with antibodies overnight. After incubated with IgG
horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies
(Cell signaling, Beverly, MA) for 2 h at room temperature,
the immunoblots were developed using the enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Cell signaling,
Beverly, MA) and visualized using a FluroChemQ
processor (Proteinsimple, Santa Clara, CA).

Statistical analysis
Results are reported as the mean ± SD for
experimental groups performed in three replicate samples.
Student t test was applied to analyze the statistical
significance of the differences between experimental
groups. The P values less than 0.05 were considered
significant.

Cell migration and invasion assay using
transwells

The authors would like to thank Drs. Jing Su,
Guangxu Jin, and Haiguo Sun for their comments and
suggestions.

For migration studies, the transwell inserts
with 8  μm pores in a 24-wells format (Coring Costar,
Cambridge, MA) were used. One million cells were
fluorescently labeled by incubation with 5 µL of dialkyl
carbocyanine membrane dye (Dil; Invitrogen) for 20 min
at 37°C. After removing the unbound dyes, 1 × 105 cells
in 300 µL of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium were seeded
into the upper chamber and 500 µL of RPMI 1640 medium
with 100 ng/mL SDF-1 in the lower chamber. After 24 h
incubation at 37°C, the cells that migrated into the lower
chamber were counted. Triplicates of each experiment
were performed.
For the invasion assay, the transwell inserts were
coated with 100 µL Matrigel (50 µg/ml) for 4 hours. Dillabeled myeloma cells (1 × 105) in 300 µL of serum-free
medium were loaded into the upper chamber and 500 µL
of RPMI 1640 medium with 100 ng/mL SDF-1 in the
lower chamber. After incubation for 24–48 hours at 37°C,
the cells in the lower chamber was collected and counted.
For the experiments with specific inhibitors,
myeloma cells were pretreated with the inhibitors for
1 hour and then loaded into the inserts. The cells in the
control groups were treated with equal amount of vehicles.
All images were acquired with an Olympus microscope.
