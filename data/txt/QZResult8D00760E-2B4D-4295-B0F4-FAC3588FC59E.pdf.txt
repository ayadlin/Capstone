ABSTRACT
Anaplastic thyroid cancers and radioiodine resistant thyroid cancer are posing
a major treat since surgery combined with Iodine131 therapy is ineffective on them.
Small-molecule inhibitors are presenting a new hope for patients, but often lead to
drug resistance in many cancers. Based on the major mutations found in thyroid
cancer, we propose the combination of a MEK inhibitor and a Pi3’-kinase inhibitor
in pre-clinical models. We used human thyroid cancer cell lines and genetically
engineered double mutant BRAFV600E PIK3CAH1047R mice to evaluate the effect of both
inhibitors separately or in combination in terms of proliferation and signaling in vitro;
tumor burden, histology, cell death induction and tumor markers expression in vivo.
The combination of MEK and Pi’3-kinase inhibition shows a synergistic effect in term
of proliferation and apoptosis induction through Survivin down-regulation in vitro.
We show for the first time the effects of the combination of a MEK inhibitor and
Pi3’-kinase inhibitor in a genetically engineered mouse model of aggressively lethal
thyroid cancer. In fine, the two drugs cooperate to promote tumor shrinkage by
inducing a proliferation arrest and an elevation of apoptosis in vivo. Moreover, a
phenotypic reversion is also observed with a partial restoration of normal thyroid
marker transcription, and thyroid cancer marker expression reduction.
In conclusion, combination therapy of MEK and Pi3’-kinase inhibition synergizes
to target double mutant thyroid cancer in vitro and in vivo. This multidrug approach
could readily be translated into clinical practice and bring new perspectives for the
treatment of incurable thyroid carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION

United States according to the American Cancer Society,
with a prevalence in women 3 times as high as in men
[5]. Nevertheless, morbidity remains low compared to
most other cancers since the more common subtypes of
thyroid cancers have an excellent prognosis. Differentiated
thyroid cancers including papillary (PTC) and follicular
(FTC) thyroid cancers represent 90% of all thyroid cancers
[6]. With 80% of cases, PTC is the most prevalent type.
It responds very well to therapy consisting of surgery
combined with therapeutic radioiodine (131I). However,
patients with more advanced thyroid malignancies present
the greatest challenge in the management of thyroid
cancer. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) although rare,
causes almost 50% of thyroid cancer related deaths [7].

Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine
cancer. Its incidence has been rapidly increasing over
the last decades but with a stable related morbidity
rate [1]. Better detection of small tumors, thanks to the
increased use of ultrasound and also histopathological
over diagnosis, explains a part the rising incidence [2, 3].
The other part may be explained by increasing exposure to
high levels of radiation including from radiation treatment
to the head and neck, and/or fallout from nuclear power
plant accidents or weapons testing [4].
About 62,500 new cases of thyroid cancer and more
than 1,900 related deaths are estimated for 2015 in the

This undifferentiated subtype is associated with a very poor
prognosis and considered as one of the most aggressive
cancers in humans with a 5-months median survival
[8]. ATC is suspected to arise from well-differentiated
thyroid carcinomas like PTC by further progression/
dedifferentiation or to arise via poorly differentiated
thyroid carcinomas (PDTC) [9, 10].
ATC presents as a diffuse invasion of structures in
the neck such as trachea, esophagus, blood vessels and
nerves, making surgery difficult to perform. Ultimately,
this results in dyspnea and suffocation, which is the main
cause of death in patients [11]. Nevertheless, metastasis is
still observed in 10-20% of ATC cases, predominantly in
the lung and bones [12].
BRAF is part of the Mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway leading to MAPK/ERK kinase
(MEK) and Extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)
phosphorylation. It is commonly activated by somatic
mutations in human cancer [13]. Detected in 8% of all
cancers, BRAF mutations are common in melanoma and
thyroid cancer with respective frequencies of 60% and
40%. The point mutation A1799T, coding for the V600E
transversion, accounts for 90% of BRAF mutations.
It is the most common mutation found in PTC (45% of
patients), however, BRAF alone as a prognostic factor
is controversial [14]. Data from sequencing of PDTC
and ATC suggest, that the progression from welldifferentiated thyroid cancers to ATC happens as a result
of the cooperation between multiple acquired alterations
such as mutations in CTNNB1 (Human β-catenin gene),
PIK3CA (Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit),
TP53 (Transformation related protein 53) and PTEN
(Phosphatase and tensin homolog). Furthermore, copy
number and epigenetic changes involving oncogenes have
been described in this context [15].
Facing human cohort recruitment difficulties, animal
models recapitulating the key genetic aspects of ATC are
needed as a substitute. Currently, investigations are based
on large retrospective cohort studies with a paucity of
prospective randomized trials. Recently, significant efforts
have been made in the direction of developing murine
preclinical platforms allowing, on one hand, a better
understanding of crucial events in the disease initiation
and progression and, on the other hand, evaluation of
rational targeted therapies. The role of the most common
mutation BRAFV600E in PTC initiation has been shown in
several independent mouse models. First, thyroid-specific
transgenic overexpression of BRAFV600E, induces goiter
and invasive PTC with tall-cell features, which later
transition to poorly differentiated carcinomas [16]. Later,
a mouse model using thyroid-specific recombination to
mimick the point mutation event observed in patients,
demonstrated that BRAFV600E expression was sufficient to
drive PTC formation [17].
Furthermore, several mouse models associating
BRAF mutations to other oncogenic mutations have been
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

described [18]. Deletion or dominant negative mutation of
TP53 leads to progression from PTC to ATC [19]. Another
model using PIK3CAH1047R and BRAFV600E expression in
the thyroid showed that the combination cooperates to
promote tumor progression to ATC, characterized by local
invasion and subsequent death of the mice by suffocation
[20], resembling very closely the human disease.
Thyroid tumors carrying BRAFV600E mutations are
assumed to be exquisitely dependent on the oncoprotein
activity for viability. Thus, pharmacological inhibition is
associated with tumor regression and a partial restoration
of the differentiated phenotype [17]. However, monotherapies targeting one component of the MAPK pathway
in human patients are only transiently effective in some
cancers such as melanoma, since resistance arises
frequently after few months [21]. This resistance is due
to reactivation of the ERK signaling pathway via various
mechanisms [22, 23].
We hypothesize that targeting both MAPK and
Phosphoinositide 3′-kinase (Pi3′-kinase) pathways by
inhibiting the mutated enzymes that drive the development
of the disease or their downstream targets MEK would
have clinically measurable beneficial effect. To address
this question, we started by studying the effect of drugs
targeting the two pathways in human ATC cell lines. We
looked at eventual cooperation and possible molecular
mechanisms driving it. We used a mouse model of
aggressive PTC that progresses to ATC (thyrocyte-specific
expression of BRAFV600E and PIK3CAH1047R [20]) to
evaluate the combination effects of MEK and PI3′-kinase
inhibition in a pre-clinical context. The tumor burden
measured by ultrasound was used as a read-out, along
with the evaluation of the expression of clinical markers
of thyroid cancer and the transcription of normal thyroid
markers in tumor tissue from treated mice.

RESULTS
MEK inhibition synergizes with Piʹ3-kinase
inhibition in ATC cell lines
Since cancer is driven by multiple mutational
events, multidrug approaches are now becoming standard
to tackle tumors. Moreover, most mono-therapies are
showing mitigated results and emergence of resistance
mechanisms with time. We wanted to assess if targeting
MEK downstream of BRAF in combination with a Pi3′kinase inhibitor induces stronger proliferation reduction
than any drug alone in human ATC cell lines. Three
cell lines with BRAFV600E mutations were selected.
The SW1736 cell line has no other mutations reported.
However, OCUT-2 cells have an additional PIK3CAH1047R
mutation and 8505c cells have both TP53 and CDKN2A
(Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2) deletions.
We used PD-325901, which is a potent and selective
MEK1/2 inhibitor that has reached phase II clinical trials
24605

Oncotarget

for advanced non-small lung cancer, as a single agent [24].
For Pi3′-kinase inhibition, we used GDC-0941, currently
studied in phase Ib/II clinical trials for solid tumors [25].
To test the nature of the collaboration between the
two drugs, we performed a synergy test by incubating cells
with a range of concentrations from 0.016 fold of IG50 to 10
fold of IG50 obtained by 5-fold serial dilutions. The specific
Half-maximal inhibitory growth concentrations (IG50) of
PD-325901 and GDC-0941 used to calculate synergy, and
previously determined for each cell line experimentally,
were respectively around 10 nM and 200 nM in both
OCUT-2 and SW1736 cell lines. In 8505c cell line, the
IG50 concentrations were 20 nM and 300 nM. In 8505c
and OCUT-2 cells, a greater inhibition of proliferation was
obtained with the combination, as seen by the left shift of
the combination curve compared to the single treatment
curves. This effect was less pronounced in SW1736 cells
(Figure 1A). The constant concentration ratio approach
(See Material and Methods) allowed us to calculate the
combination index from the obtained proliferation data
based on the method of Chou and Talalay [26].
The strongest synergistic effect was obtained in
OCUT-2 cell lines followed by 8505c. In SW1736 The
combination index was ranged from 0.8 to 0.9 over the
concentrations tested. Even though 1.0 is the mathematical

threshold, 0.85 is considered a more significant threshold
since, statistically, the combination index cannot be
considered to show any effect deviating from the additivity
between 0.85 and 1.0 [27]. We can say then that in this cell
line we have, in the range of concentrations used, an effect
between additive and moderately synergistic (Figure 1B).
To understand the mechanism underlying the
inhibition, we investigated the effect of the drugs on cell
cycling. PD-325901 alone or in combination with GDC0941 induced a G1 cycle arrest in SW1736 and 8505c cell
lines. However, in OCUT-2, a significant effect was only
observed for the combination (Figure 1C). Altogether
this moderate additional cytostatic effect of the drug
combination could not explain the synergy in terms of
reduction in cell number. Therefore, we hypothesized
that induction of cell death could explain the difference
observed. We then performed an apoptosis assay by flow
cytometry using annexinV and Propidium Iodide (PI).
Only the OCUT-2 cell line already showed increased
apoptosis (double positive annexinV and PI cells) when
treated with the combination for 24 h (Figure 2A).
However, after 48 h of combination treatment, all three
cell lines (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 1) had
elevated double positive annexinV/PI cells (late apoptosis)
and annexinV positive cells (early apoptosis). The most

to the untreated. All the measurements were done in triplicate and the mean was represented with SEM. The constant ratio approach allows
figuring out obvious synergistic effect between drugs and calculating the combination index. (B) Combination index (CI) as a function of

remarkable observation was the significant decrease of
intact cells with drug combinations in all three cell lines
after 48 h.
To further investigate the observed apoptosis,
we performed western blot analysis. ERK1/2 and AKT
phosphorylation were assessed first to demonstrate the
drug efficiency. ERK1/2 phosphorylation ratio (p-ERK1/2
normalized to total ERK) was strongly decreased in all
cell lines when treated with PD-325901 alone or in
combination with GDC-0941. Similarly, GDC-0941
induced a strong reduction of AKT phosphorylation ratio
(Figure 3). Ribosomal S6 phosphorylation was affected
by both treatments and the combination resulted in further
de-phosphorylation of S6 showing a collaborative effect of
the two drugs at the level of this signaling node.
Cell death was also investigated by detection of
cleaved caspase 3 (CC3). In all three cell lines, CC3
was mainly driven by PD-325901 treatment, but still
showed a further elevation upon addition of GDC-0941.
We additionally tested modulators of caspase activity
like Survivin: there we could detect a down regulation of
Survivin in whole protein lysates that was also found in
the drug combination. This conjunction of CC3 elevation
combined with down regulation of Survivin could very
likely explain the increased cell death that was observed
with a time shift of 24 to 48 h. Apoptotic cell death was
assessed here by monitoring DNA fragmentation with

gamma-H2AX that was found increased under drug
treatments in both whole cell lysates and nuclear extracts
(Figure 3) in the three cell lines. We also tested alternative
mechanisms of apoptosis like X-chromosome-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) down regulation or
induction of the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) but these
did not show any differences in expression (Figure 3).

BRAFV600E and PIK3CAH1047R tumors regressed
under MEK inhibitor treatment and further if
combined with Pi3′-kinase inhibitor
To test if PD-325901 and GDC-0941 would
also cooperate in vivo, we used a previously described
mouse model of thyroid cancer [20]. In this model, the
endogenous expression of BRAFV600E and PIK3CAH1047R
can be induced by tamoxifen specifically in thyrocytes at
30 days of age. After tamoxifen injection, mice rapidly
develop PTC that progresses to ATC and death of the
mouse within 3 to 6 months after the drug-induced
mutational induction [20]. Treatment of mice with drugs
was started 2 months after tumor induction and ultrasound
measurements were performed weekly to assess the tumor
burden (Figure 4A–4B). Untreated mice display a steadily
increasing tumor burden reaching 220% over the time
of the experiment. GDC-0941 treated mice presented a
20% tumor burden reduction at 6 weeks of treatment but

regained their starting size after 9 weeks. Interestingly,
PD-325901 treated mice presented a 40% tumor burden
reduction after 6 weeks of treatment and remained stable
for the rest of the experiment. Strikingly, the combination
treated animals had a more pronounced response with a
60% tumor burden reduction after 7 weeks (Figure 4A).
After 9 weeks of treatment, we seemed to have achieved
a maximum stable response for the combo-treated animals.
Therefore, three mice from each group were dissected and
thyroids were processed for histological analysis. Untreated
mice showed an expected histology with PTC areas, tall cell
morphology and phenotypic progression to ATC in some
areas. Interestingly, PD-325901 treated mice showed a clear
improvement in histology with some almost normal follicles
and smaller PTC areas. GDC-0941 did not induce a beneficial
effect at the histological level. Finally, mice treated with the
combination, although resulting in smaller sections, seemed
to have a similar histological presentation to PD-325901 alone
treated animals (Figure 4C).
In terms of signaling, ERK and AKT phosphorylation
ratios were assessed by western blot after 9 weeks of
treatment to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug regimen.
PD-325901 alone or in combination was able to induce
a strong dephosphorylation of ERK1/2. However, GDC0941 induced only a small non-significant decrease in
terms of AKT phosphorylation. In tumors from PD325901 treated animals there was a tendency to elevated
AKT phosphorylation, that became significant in the
combination treatment (Figure 5A–5B). The lack of effect
of GDC-0941 on AKT-phosphorylation was unexpected.
Therefore, we tested the drug on mice over a shorter period
of time. Another group of mice was treated with only one
dose of GDC-0941 by oral gavage then sacrificed 4 hours
later. In this setting, western blots showed a much stronger
reduction of AKT phosphorylation (-80%) (Figure 5C–5D)
showing that the drug was efficiently inhibiting Pi3′kinase, even if the effect on the read-out pAKT does not
seem to last under a chronic treatment.

with PD-325901 or the combination no longer showed
the histological improvement seen after treatment and
presented with an aggressive phenotype (Figure 6B).

BRAFV600E and PIK3CAH1047R tumors regressed
under MEK and Pi3′-kinase inhibition by reducing
cell proliferation and increasing cell death
In order to understand the mechanisms driving the
tumor regression, we performed immunofluorescence
staining for Ki67, CC3 and DNA fragmentation (Terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
or TUNEL) on thyroid sections of the 9 weeks treated
mice. The proliferation index was significantly reduced
in tumors from PD-325901 treated animals or in the
combination treated group compared to the control,
but not significantly in the GDC-0941 treated group
(Figure 7A). Concerning CC3, we could see an increase in
PD-325901 and GDC-0941 treated mice, but the combination
resulted the highest score even if that was not statistically
significant (Figure 7B). We performed TUNEL staining to
monitor DNA laddering, the main hallmark of apoptosis
driven cellular death, and we could find a significantly
elevated positive staining in tumors from the PD-325901 and
the combination treated animals (Figure 7C).
To confirm the phenotype reversion found in
PD-325901 treated thyroids, we performed staining
for the tumor markers Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and
Galectin-3 (Gal-3), that are clinically used markers of
thyroid cancer. While controls and GDC-0941 treated
samples showed clear positive staining, PD-325901 and
combination treated animals showed drastically reduced
positivity for CK19 and very low positivity for Galectin-3
(Figure 8A). In fact, Galectin-3 positive cells observed in
PD-325901 and combination treated samples are immune
cells (e.g. macrophages) trapped in the cystic areas. This
reversion was also tested by measuring thyroid specific
markers by qPCR. PD-325901 induces the re-expression
of all normal thyroid markers tested: Sodium Iodide
Symporter (Nis), transcription factor Paired Box 8 (Pax8),
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor (Tsh-r), Thyroid
Peroxidase (Tpo) and Thyroglobulin (Tg). All of these
genes, but Pax8, showed elevation of the transcription
with MEK inhibition treatment, while GDC-0941 showed
almost no alteration. Combination treatment showed
elevations but not higher than MEK inhibition alone
(Figure 8B).

Drug removal induces immediate regrowth of all
tumors
To test if the treatment was curative we performed
tumor burden measurement after drug release in two mice
remaining from the PD-325901 and GDC-0941 treatment
groups and one mouse remaining from the combo-treated
group (after week 9). From the ultrasound data acquired
in this configuration we could clearly conclude that in
all treated mice living tumor cells were remaining and
capable of re-growing suggesting that the treatments were
not curative (Figure 6A).
Looking at the histology of re-growth, untreated
mice displayed features of progression with large areas
of ATC. GDC-0941 treated mice although presenting the
biggest tumors, look mostly like regular PTC and did not
seem to have progressed to ATC. Thyroids in mice treated

DISCUSSION
The management of ATC with multimodality treatment
has so far failed to improve survival in patients. The lack
of randomized studies prevents clinicians from being
conclusive about the benefits of the available treatments
including surgery. To improve the outcome, rationally
targeted therapies are needed. Well-differentiated thyroid

In addition, PIK3CA is also found frequently amplified in
ATC [29]. Targeting both the RAF→MEK→ERK and the
Pi3′-kinase→AKT→mTOR pathways is therefore a good
rational to tackle aggressive forms of thyroid cancer.
The synergistic effect observed when targeting both
pathways in two ATC cell lines demonstrates that the two
pathways are needed to drive proliferation (Figure 1A–1B).
Interestingly, synergy was stronger in OCUT-2 cell line,
the only cell line harboring both the BRAFV600E and the
PIK3CAH1047R mutations emphasizing the oncogene
addiction effect. Nonetheless, the synergistic effect was
observed in 8505c and an additive effect close to synergy
was found in SW1736. As the later have no known
mutations in PIK3CA, this suggest that these cell lines
still require “wildtype” Pi3′-kinase activity to maintain
proliferation. A similar synergistic effect was observed in
thyroid cancer cell lines using RAF inhibitors (RAF265
and ZSTK474) with a Pi3′-kinase inhibitor (SB590885)
in two PTC cell lines and in 8505c [30] or using a MEK
inhibitor (AZD6244) with GDC-0941 on OCUT-1 cells
and other PTC cell lines [31]. This shows that a variety
of thyroid cancer cell lines are responding synergistically
to drugs targeting the same (or similar) signaling nodes,
thus supporting our presented data. Interestingly, it was

carcinomas are treated effectively by surgical resection and
radioiodine therapy but there are limitations in using this
strategy in ATC and radioiodine resistant PTC. The local
invasiveness characterizing the undifferentiated type (ATC)
is making it almost inoperable because of the presence of
vital vessels and nerves. Understanding the key genetic
events promoting the dedifferentiation and consequently
progression and the maintenance of aggressive kinds of
thyroid cancers is therefore crucial for the development of
new effective treatments.
Currently, more and more efforts are focusing in
the development of combination treatments targeting
more than one target and/or pathway. This trend in cancer
research is based on the fact that mono-chemotherapy is
often associated with resistance, recurrence and sometimes
worsening of the disease.
Synergy in combining anticancer drugs has to be
uncovered empirically taking advantage of pre-clinical
models like cell culture and genetically engineered mice.
Previously published work has shown that BRAFV600E
and PIK3CAH1047R mutations collaborate to promote
rapid PTC formation and eventual ATC progression [20].
Moreover, these mutations are frequently found in ATC
[28] with 25% for BRAFV600E and 15% for PIK3CAH1047R.

overcome the resistance of some thyroid cancer cell lines
to Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha-Related ApoptosisInducing Ligand (TRAIL) signaling (Lexatumumab),
confirming the crucial role of Pi3′-kinase involvement in
thyroid cancer cells’ drugs response [32].
Since cell cycle analysis could not explain the
observed synergy: G1 arrest with marginal further effect

when combined (Figure 1C–1D); we aimed at investigating
drug-induced cell death mechanisms in the three ATC
cell lines. To that end we evaluated cell death induction
by performing annexinV/PI staining. An apoptotic
effect of the drugs in the three cell lines could be seen
48h after treatment and, interestingly in these cases, the
proportion of early or late apoptosis or necrosis was quite
variable between the 3 cell lines, but ultimately the drug

combination induced a superior effect, in terms of reducing
the number of intact cells in the three cell lines than any
drug alone (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 1).
In order to understand this drug-driven apoptosis
induction, we investigated the effect of the treatments on
cell signaling by western blotting. CC3 was moderately
increased 24 h after treatment with MEK inhibitor but
more when combined with the Pi3′-kinase inhibitor.
Because the delay in apoptosis induction suggested that
another mechanism was involved, we then looked for
alternative cell death mechanisms. AIF does not involve
caspases (its translocation into the nucleus leads to DNA
fragmentation). However, none of our different treatments
had any influence in both total and nuclear AIF levels
suggesting no involvement of this mechanism. GammaH2AX, a marker of DNA damage which is a late event
shared by all cell death mechanisms [33], increased with
MEK inhibitor alone and further with the combination.
We then investigated mechanisms involved in the
regulation of CC3 activity. We found that Survivin, a
member of inhibitor of apoptosis protein family (IAP) that
sequestrates caspases and prevents the activation of the
cascade responsible for apoptosis [34], was downregulated
with drug treatments (Figure 3). This effect relying on
protein turnover could explain the delayed apoptosis seen
in cells (Figure 2).
This drug combination effect has never been tried in
genetically engineered mouse model of thyroid cancer. We
wanted to translate this synergistic effect observed in cells
into a highly clinically relevant model in vivo. In a very
similar fashion, both drugs showed a significant effect on
tumor burden, but the combination showed an even more
pronounced effect, that was statistically significant after
7 weeks of treatment (Figure 4A). Tumor growth was
stabilized by GDC-0941 treatment, unlike the controls
that kept on growing. This is a very interesting result
showing that PIK3CA is not only important for the tumor
in the initial phase [20] but that tumors still rely on its
activity even a few months after induction. In addition,
while untreated mice had several more aggressive regions
looking like ATC at the end of the experiment (Figure
4C) GDC-0941 treated thyroids showed mainly PTC-like
lesions. These observations also confirm the importance
of the PIK3CAH1047R mutation for ATC progression, as
published previously [20]. The observed reduction in the
tumor burden after PD-325901 treatment (Figure 4A),
was due to a cell proliferation arrest (Figure 7A). This
effect was potentiated by the combination with GDC0941, with a more profound tumor burden reduction
(60% for the combination versus 40% for PD-325901
alone) that could be explained by an apoptosis induction
in addition to the PD-325901-dependent proliferation
arrest (Figure 7A–7C), since the proliferation index was
similarly affected. As shown by histology (Figure 4C), we
were able to achieve a partial tumor remission in the time
period considered (9 weeks) which is already a remarkable
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

result considering the aggressive nature of the disease
we were dealing with. Nevertheless, the remaining cells
were still viable and resumed growth after drug removal
(Figure 6). This implies that mutant cells could be tamed
by MEK inhibition, but recover their aggressive behavior
after drug removal. We think that MEK inhibition mainly
pushes cells to re-differentiate. Then cells failing to
repair their high genomic damage undergo apoptosis
under the treatment pressure. Consequently, the highgrade tumor areas get killed and replaced by cells which
succeeded to differentiate and/or the already resistant well
differentiated tumor cells. The concomitant occurrence of
re-differentiation and apoptosis was suggested by some
studies however others propose that apoptosis is occurring
later on [35, 36].
In terms of drug effect and pathways, we were able
to show that MEK inhibition could maintain ERK1/2
phosphorylation levels to a practically undetectable
level over the whole period of drug dosage (Figure 5A).
We think that ERK1/2 inactivation promotes the redifferentiation of cells into functional thyrocytes. This
is supported by the fact that thyroid cancer markers
Cytokeratin-19 and Galectin-3 detection are strongly
reduced upon MEK inhibition (Figure 6A). In addition,
qPCR showed that normal thyroid markers that are
usually lost in advanced thyroid cancers [37] are partially
restored by the drug (Figure 8B), possibly rendering the
tumor susceptible to radioactive iodine again. This is
consistent with what has been previously published by
the group of Prof. James Fagin in a PTC model [38].
Nevertheless, this is the first time that this effect is shown
in a PTC/ATC mouse model where therapeutic options are
extremely limited. In addition, we also show that while
GDC-0941 induces a further decrease in tumor burden,
it does not induce an additional beneficial effect in terms
of thyroid marker expression, meaning that Pi3′-kinase
does not play such a differentiation-driver role as ERK
in the context of thyroid cancer. This was consistent with
a recently published paper showing that complete ERK
inhibition with a MEK inhibitor maximizes the responses
of BRAFV600E thyroid cancers to radioiodine by inducing
sustained re-differentiation [39].
Unlike MEK inhibition, Pi3′-kinase inhibition could
not maintain low AKT phosphorylation levels over time,
meaning that another mechanism comes to compensate this.
Still, the drug presents a strong effect in terms of tumor
burden showing that Pi3′-kinase effect cannot be only
reduced to AKT phosphorylation. A similar observation
has been shown in another study by our group (Roelli et al,
Manuscript in preparation). This uncoupling of Pi3′-kinase
inhibition effect and AKT phosphorylation suggesting
AKT independent actions of Pi3′-kinase would be a very
interesting phenomenon to investigate in a future study.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated here that the
combination of a MEK1/2 inhibitor with a PI3′-kinase
inhibitor in the context of thyroid cancer is a valid
24615

approach that could relatively easy be translated into
clinical practice. The advances in management of MEK
inhibitors could allow such treatment to be realistically
considered for patients, avoiding the toxic side effects
(of current MEK inhibitors). The most interesting part
is really the fact that MEK inhibition induces a kind of
“re- diferentiation” of the thyroid, finally opening the door
for new clinical managements of ATC cancer patients, a
disease where the standard treatment of care has not
changed much in the last 40 years.

were used respectively at the following concentrations
(100 nM, 20 nM, 4 nM, 0.8 nM, 0.16 nM) and (2 µM,
400 nM, 80 nM, 16 nM, 3.2 nM) in SW1736 and OCUT2 cell lines. In 8505c the final concentrations used were
(200 nM, 40 nM, 8 nM, 1.6 nM, 0.32 nM) for PD-325901
and (3 µM, 600 nM, 120 nM, 24 nM, 4.8 nM) for GDC0941. These concentrations represent approximately (10,
2, 0.4, 0.08 and 0.016) times fold of the calculated IG50
for each drug in each cell line. Cells were incubated 72 h
then formalin-fixed and stained with crystal violet. Crystal
violet was recovered in Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate 1%.
Optical density at 550 nm was measured after lysis and
normalized to the untreated cells. Curves of percentage
of inhibition as a function of IG50 equivalents were
obtained. This constant ratio approach allows to calculate
the combination index (CI) values. CI = (D)1/(Dx)1 + (D)2/
(Dx)2 [26].
At 50% inhibition level, (Dx)1 and (Dx)2 are the
concentrations of PD-325901 and GDC-0941, respectively
that induce alone a 50% inhibition of cell growth; (D)1
and (D)2 are concentrations of PD-325901 and GDC-0941
in combination, which also inhibits cell growth by 50%
(D)1/(Dx)1 reflect how much Drug 2 potentiate the affect of
Drug 1 and (D)2/(Dx)2 reflect how much Drug 1 potentiate
Drug 2 in combination. When the 2 drugs potentiate each
other (Synergy) each one lowers the concentration of the
other which is necessary to reproduce the same effect as
a single agent.
The combination index was calculated for each
percentage of inhibition or fraction affected (Fa).
Synergism or antagonism was calculated on the basis of
the multiple drug-effect equation and evaluated by the CI,
where CI < 1, CI = 1, and CI > 1 indicate respectively
synergism, additivity and antagonism using Compusyn 2.0
software based on the Chou and Talalay method.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
Unless specified otherwise, chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Switzerland. MEK and Pi3′-kinase
inhibitors, PD-325901 and GDC-0941 respectively, have
been purchased from AbMole Bioscience Hong-Kong.

Animals
Compound mice were obtained by combining
the following alleles: BrafCA [40], Pik3caLat [41] and
Thyroglobulin-CreERT2 [42]. Mutations were induced by
5 consecutive daily injections of 1 mg tamoxifen IP. Mice
were kept in isolated ventilated cages, fed ad libitum in a
12/12 h cycle of light and dark. Mice were kept, treated
and euthanized according to the Swiss federal guidelines.
The experimental protocol was approved by the Bernese
cantonal ethical commission for animal experimentation
(Licence number: BE120/13).

Cell lines
8505c cells have a BRAFV600E mutation in addition
to p53 and CDKN2A alterations. Cells were purchased at
the Public Health England repository (Culture Collections,
Salisbury-UK) and cultured in RPMI 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% Non-Essential Amino
Acids (NEAA) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S). OCUT2 carries concomitant BRAFV600E and PIK3CAH1047R mutations
which was donated by Prof. James Fagin (Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center) validated by Single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) and cultured in DMEM medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% NEAA

purchased at the Cell Line Service (CLS, Eppelheim-DE) and
cultured in RPMI 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% P/S.
All cell lines were cultured for a maximum of 40 passages or
6 months; whichever limit was reached first.

Cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide (PI)
staining
After 24 h, the medium was centrifuged for 5′ at
300 g to recover the floating cells. Attached cells were
trypsinized (Trypsin 0.05%) and recovered with medium.
After 5′ of centrifugation at 300 g, the pellets were
re-suspended in PBS, and counted using a Neubauer
chamber. Then attached cells were pooled with the floating
cells and centrifuged for 5′ at 300 g. Cells were then
re-suspended in cold PBS at 1 million cells/ml. Then,
cells were centrifuged for 5′ at 300 g and the pellet was
re-suspended in 0.3 ml cold PBS /million cells. Then
0.7 ml cold ethanol 70% per million cells was added
drop wise while vortexing gently. The suspensions were
aliquoted in 1 ml aliquots and left over night at 4°C.
The tubes were centrifuged 10′ at 1,000 g at 4°C
and the supernatants were decanted. Pellets were washed
once with 1 ml cold PBS 1x and then centrifuged 10′ at
1,000 g at 4°C. Cells pellets were re-suspended in 250 μl

cytometry analysis

Drug treatments and ultrasound imaging
Mice were treated by oral gavage with 5 mg/kg of PD325901 or 50 mg/kg of GDC-0941, or the combination of
both, formulated in 5% hydroxpropyl methylcellulose 6 days
per week. Mice were anesthetized with 5 μl/g body weight of
a mixture of 0.1 mg/ml Dorbene, 0.5 mg/ml Dormicum and
5 μg/ml Fentanyl in 0.9% NaCl injected intraperitoneally.
The fur around the neck was epilated with Veet® hair removal
cream. Pictures were acquired with an ESAOTE MyLab Five
ultrasound machine using a LA455 Probe (18 MHz) from
Siemens. After imaging, mice were taken out of anesthesia
with 10 μl/g body weight of a mixture of 0.25 mg/ml Alzan,
5 μg/ml Flumazenil and 20 μg/ml Naloxon in 0.9% NaCl
injected sub-cutaneously. Images were analyzed using the
ImageJ software. Tumor burden was assayed as the surface
of the biggest thyroid section observed and normalized to the
size at the beginning of the experiment.

Cells were treated with PD-325901 and/or GDC0941 at 100 nM and 1 µM concentration respectively
for 24 h or 48 h. Floating cells were centrifuged at 1,000
g for 10′. Attached cells were washed with PBS and
trypsinized before re-suspending them in the appropriate
media. Cells suspensions were centrifuged at 300 g for
10′, re-suspended in cold PBS before a second round of
centrifugation at 300 g for 10′. The fractions of floating
cells and attached cells were pooled in 1X annexinV
binding buffer and re-suspended. Cells were counted
and 100 µl of cell suspension containing 105 cells was
transferred to a 5 ml culture tubes. BD Pharmingen FITC
annexinV Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences) was
used for the staining. 5 µl of FITC annexinV and 10 µl
of PI were added to the suspension, gently vortexed and
incubated for 15′ at room temperature in the dark before
measuring by flow cytometry within 1 h.

Immunofluorescence

Total protein preparation from cells

Mice were anesthetized using 10 µl/g of bodyweight
of a Ketamin/Xylazin mixture (10 mg/ml and 1.6 mg/ ml
respectively) injected intraperitoneally. Thyroids were
dissected and washed with ice cold PBS. Tissues were fixed
overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (Sigma).
After paraffin embedding, 5 μm sections were prepared.
Sections were rehydrated and targets were retrieved in
TEG buffer (10 mM Tris and 0.5 mM EGTA). Sections
were blocked three times 10′ in a buffer of 1% BSA, 0.2%
gelatin, and 0.05% Saponin in PBS. Antibodies were
diluted in 0.1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS to the
following concentrations: KI67 (Abcam-16667 1:300), CC3
(CST-9664S 1:300), CK19 (TROMA-III DSHB 1:300),
Galectin-3 (Abcam-53082 1:300). Primary antibodies were
incubated over night at 4°C. The slides were washed three
times with 0.1% BSA, 0.2% gelatin and 0.05% Saponin in
PBS. The secondary antibody was goat anti Rabbit 488 Life
Technologies A-11034 1:500. DAPI Sigma 32670 was used
at a final concentration of 5 µg/µl. Secondary antibodies
were incubated 1 h at room temperature.

After 24 h of treatment, both floating and attached
cells were recovered. They were then centrifuged for 5′ at
350 g at 4°C and washed twice with 10 ml cold PBS and
re-suspended in 1 ml cold PBS. Cells were then pelleted at
500 g and lysed in RIPA buffer with Halt™ Protease and
Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Pierce, ThermoFischer
Scientific). The lysates were incubated 30′ on ice and then
centrifuged for 15′ at 16,000 g at 4°C. Supernatants were
recovered, and protein concentrations were quantified by
the Bradford method (Pierce, ThermoFischer Scientific,
BCA Protein Assay Kit).
Lysates were prepared at 1-4 µg/µl in sample buffer
(5x; 1.47 M sucrose, 10% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 300 mM
Tris pH 8.8, 0.25% Bromophenol blue, and 130 mM
dithiothreitol) and the proteins were run on TGX precast
4-20% gels (BioRad, Switzerland), transferred onto TransBlot transfer pack nitrocellulose (BioRad, Switzerland),
and analyzed by western blotting.
