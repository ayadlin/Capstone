ABSTRACT
The Yes-associated protein, YAP, is a transcriptional co-activator, mediating the
Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition program in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC). With the aim to identify compounds that can specifically modulate YAP
functionality in PDAC cell lines, we performed a small scale, drug-based screening
experiment using YAP cell localization as the read-out. We identified erlotinib as an
inducer of YAP cytoplasmic localization, an inhibitor of the TEA luciferase reporter
system and the expression of the bona fide YAP target gene, Connective Tissue
Growth Factor CTGF. On the other hand, BIS I, an inhibitor of PKCδ and GSK3β, caused
YAP accumulation into the nucleus. Activation of β-catenin reporter and interfering
experiments show that inhibition of the PKCδ/GSK3β pathway triggers YAP nuclear
accumulation inducing YAP/TEAD transcriptional response. Inhibition of GSK3β by
BIS I reduced the expression levels of SMADs protein and reduced YAP contribution
to EMT. Notably, BIS I reduced proliferation, migration and clonogenicity of PDAC
cells in vitro, phenocopying YAP genetic down-regulation. As shown by chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments and YAP over-expressing rescue experiments, BIS
I reverted YAP-dependent EMT program by modulating the expression of the YAP
target genes E-cadherin, vimentin, CTGF and of the newly identified target, CD133.
In conclusion, we identified two different molecules, erlotinib and BIS I, modulating
YAP functionality although via different mechanisms of action, with the second one
specifically inhibiting the YAP-dependent EMT program in PDAC cell lines.

and activity, by phosphorylating YAP at Serine127.
Phosphorylation of YAP by the Hippo pathway leads to
its accumulation in the cytoplasm and, by interaction with
14–3–3 proteins, YAP is degraded by a ubiquitinationdependent proteasomal process. Therefore, the Hippo
pathway negatively regulates YAP functionality and
presence in the nucleus by modulating its cell distribution
and its protein expression levels too. Importantly, the
Hippo pathway-induced phosphorylation of YAP rules
its functionality according to cell density. At low density,

INTRODUCTION
The Yes-associated protein, YAP, is a transcriptional
co-activator containing a proline-rich region responsible
for the interaction with SH3 domains of c-Yes and
many other proteins [1]. Multiple post-translational
modifications (PTMs) regulate the functions of YAP.
The Hippo signaling pathway, initially defined as a tissue
growth and organ size regulator in Drosophila, is a kinase
cascade able to negatively regulate YAP localization

YAP is predominantly localized in the nucleus while
YAP translocates to the cytoplasm at high cell density
[2]. Cytoplasmic YAP has been found associated with
numerous protein complexes that mainly mediate its
sequestration and consequent functional inactivation. As
an example, Angiomotins recruit YAP to Tight Junctions
or the actin cytoskeleton, in a Hippo pathway-independent
manner, resulting in reduced YAP nuclear localization
[3,4]. On the same line, when the WNT pathway is off, the
association of YAP with beta-catenin leads to reciprocal
inhibition of both proteins [5–7]. GSK3β inhibition
by 6-bromoindirubin-30-oxime (BIO) promotes the
activation of YAP via de-activation of the Hippo pathway
[6]. Nuclear localization of YAP protein is associated with
its co-transcriptional activity. However, YAP is at the
crossroad of many signaling pathways, where it plays a
role depending on the upstream stimuli and the binding
to its multiple targets. Among the transcription factors
bound to YAP, members of the TEAD family were found
to be critical partners of YAP in the regulation of gene
expression. CTGF has been identified as a direct target
gene of YAP-TEAD in mammalian cells, and is crucial in
mediating the growth-stimulating and oncogenic function
of YAP-TEAD complex [8], but its transcriptional
expression depends on the contribution from other YAP
interacting transcription factors such as SMADs [9].
Additionally, many other transcription factors have been
found associated with YAP such as p73 [10], showing
that YAP can mediate oncosuppressive gene expression
program according to the cell context. Several pieces of
evidence support an important role of YAP in different
types of cancer [11,12], pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) included [13,14]. Indeed, YAP expression, via
immunohistochemistry studies in pancreatic tumor tissues,
was reported as moderate to strong in the nucleus and
cytoplasm of the tumor cells compared to adjacent normal
tissues. In cell lines, YAP localization was modulated by
cell density and its genetic ablation led to a decrease of
growth in soft agar of pancreatic cancer cells [12,13].
In PDAC mouse models, YAP has been shown to be an
essential promoter of mutant KRAS oncogenic program,
specifically inducing the expression of secreted factors
as CTGF and CYR61 [15] and associating with FOS to
regulate the expression of Epithelial to Mesenchymal
Transition genes as E-cadherin, SLUG, SNAIL and
Vimentin [16]. These pieces of evidence suggest a role of
YAP in pancreatic cancer development, potentially playing
an important role in the Epithelial to Mesenchymal
Transition (EMT) of pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore,
the identification of inhibitors of YAP activity could be
suitable as a new therapeutic option for PDAC treatment.
However, an intricate network of signaling pathways
contributes to EMT in PDAC. TGFβ signaling pathway is
frequently genetically altered in PDAC [17], and the “late
TGFβ signature” [18] actively promotes late EMT also
cooperating with YAP [9] and activating the RAS-ERK
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathway promoting the expression of EMT transcription
factors such as SNAIL and ZEB1 [19]. CD133 is a wellknown cancer stem marker [20] which has been included
to the plethora of genes responsible for EMT promotion by
activating SRC pathway [21–23].
We performed a small-scale high-content screening
for the identification of compounds able to interfere
with YAP localization and functionality. This approach
allowed us to assign to the widely used Receptor Tyrosine
Kinase (RTK) Inhibitor, erlotinib, the ability to sequester
YAP into the cytoplasm blocking its co-transcriptional
function. Additionally, we found that a small molecule,
GF 109203X (BIS I), induces YAP nuclear accumulation
and activation, however, modulating its co-transcriptional
activity by blocking the YAP-dependent EMT program
downregulating SMAD2/3.

RESULTS
YAP regulates anchorage-independent growth
in PDAC cell lines
We measured the expression level of YAP in a
panel of four PDAC cell lines using western blotting
and qRT-PCR: PANC1 and PK9 exhibited moderate to
high YAP protein levels, respectively, in comparison to
BXPC3 and MIAPACA2 cells (Figure 1A). Cell density
regulates phosphorylation and localization of YAP via
the Hippo signaling pathway. High cell density predicts a
cytoplasmic YAP localization while YAP appears mainly
localized in the nucleus in sparse cell culture of breast
cancer cells [24]. We investigated whether cell density
regulates YAP localization in pancreatic cancer cells. We
assessed the expression level and localization of YAP at
different cell densities using immunofluorescence in PK9
and PANC1 cells. Sub-cellular distribution of YAP protein
was equivalent in both cases with PANC1 cells, but YAP
significantly shuttled from nucleus to the cytoplasm at high
cell density in PK9 cells, as determined by high content
imaging analysis (Figure 1B). To investigate the functional
role of YAP, we interfered YAP expression in PK9 and
PANC1 cells using lentiviral transduction of specific
shRNA (Supplementary Figure S1A). shYAP-PANC1 and
shYAP-PK9 cells showed a decrease of 90% and 40% of
YAP mRNA compared to (SCR) control cells, respectively
(Figure 1C). CTGF and Cyr61 mRNA expression, bona
fide YAP targets, were significantly reduced in shYAPPANC1 and shYAP-PK9 (Figure 1C), whereas other
targets like AREG and BIRC5 were distinctly up-regulated
in silenced cells, indicating a transcriptional impact due
to YAP modulation. On the other hand, CTGF expression
was found increased in the case of YAP overexpression
(O/E) both in PK9 and in PANC1. CYR61 expression was
increased in PK9 O/E YAP. (Figure 1D). Phenotypically,
both YAP stable silencing (shYAP) and its transient
functional ablation inhibited anchorage-independent

6 well-plates coated with 0.7% agar (based agar) for 2 weeks. Total colony number and colony diameter were measured using Operetta
and Harmony 3.5.2 software (below).

BIS I changes YAP co-transcriptional activity
and inhibits anchorage independent growth

growth of PANC1 cells in soft agar (Figure 1E) and
slowed their proliferation rate (Supplementary Figure
S1B), in good agreement with previous data [14, 25].
Therefore, in PDAC cell lines cultured at high-density,
YAP is partially redistributed in the cytoplasm, it has a
transcriptional effect controlling the expression of known
target genes, it regulates proliferation and the ability of
PDAC cells to grow in anchorage-independent conditions.

Bisindolylmaleimide chemical family of compounds
are strong inhibitors of several kinases in the nanomolar
range and, therefore, it is difficult to associate a molecular
target directly to its efficacy. BIS I is a cell-permeable
and reversible inhibitor of protein kinases C (PKCs)
both conventional and atypical, but also of GSK3β
[28]. Moreover, compounds of the same class show
differential selectivity towards the same serine/threonine
kinases. For example, Go9676 was reported to be more
specific for PKCα than for PKCδ [29], while BIS I
behaves oppositely [30]. Since bisindolylmaleimides are
fluorescent compounds and could have interfered with
the immunofluorescence-based screening, we performed
nuclear/cytoplasmic separation and Western blots analyzes
of YAP levels upon drug treatments. We observed that
BIS I induced YAP nuclear localization in PDAC cell
lines, confirming the indication coming from the HCS
experiment (Figure 2D). Then we evaluated the stability
of YAP protein during BIS I treatment, and, in the time
frame of 48 hours, YAP protein was stable, suggesting
that we observed a pure subcellular re-localization
not affected by changes in protein expression level
(Supplementary Figure S1C). During re-localization, the
YAP post-translation status was deeply changed, as many
phosphorylation spots were present in the two-dimensional
western blots (Figure 2E). Hippo signaling pathway was
not directly involved in the observed PTMs because the
phosphorylation state of YAP-S127 and LATS-S909
did not change (Figure 2F). Additionally, we observed
a decrease in the expression level of LATS protein, an
effect that is likely independent of the activation of the
Hippo signaling but might contribute to the translocation
of YAP into the nucleus. BIS I amplified TEA reporter
signal in the basal conditions in PANC1 cells and during
YAP overexpression both in PK9 and PANC1 cells
(Figure 3A) and induced TEA reporter signal reduction
during functional ablation of YAP. Therefore, the effect
of BIS I on TEA reporter depends on the presence of
YAP (Figure 2B, 3A). Unexpectedly, BIS I significantly
suppressed CTGF and Cyr61 mRNA expression and
slightly increased AREG and BIRC5 mRNA expression in
PK9 and PANC1 cells at 24 hours of treatment, mimicking
YAP ablation (Figure 3B). To evaluate if BIS I displaces
YAP from CTGF promoter, despite YAP presence in the
nucleus, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation
of YAP and evaluated the amplification of the CTGF
promoter [31]. Indeed, YAP was no more associated
with the CTGF promoter during BIS I treatment, but
TEAD1 was still present (Figure 3C). Additionally, we
observed that BIS I inhibited TGF-β induced CTGF
expression in a YAP independent manner but activated
TEA reporter in a TGF-β independent manner (Figure 4A
and Supplementary Figure S1D). BIS I treatment reduced

Identification of modulators of YAP localization
To gain further insight into the molecular players
regulating YAP localization, we performed a small-scale
nucleo-cytoplasmic high content assay to quantify YAP
protein subcellular localization in PDAC cells. As a
cell model, we used PK9 cells as YAP was re-localizing
into the cytoplasm at high cell density (Figure 1B). We
used a library of 80 characterized kinase inhibitors (see
methods) with the aim to find molecules that could
modulate accumulation of YAP in the cytoplasm or the
nucleus, to identify the signaling cascade responsible
for these subcellular re-localizations and the biological
effects caused by its sub-cellular re-distribution. Most
of the molecules did not affect YAP localization being
the Z-score values of the nuclear/cytoplasmic intensity
close to controls (Figure  2A, Table 1, Supplementary
Table S1). Few compounds were further increasing
cytoplasmic YAP compared to control, and only two
compounds led to significant YAP accumulation into the
nucleus. Interestingly, first hits among YAP cytoplasmic
accumulators were inhibitors of tyrosine kinase receptors
(RTKIs) such as Genistein and Tyrphostins and one
inhibitor of the RAS pathway as ZM336372. On the other
hand, inducers of YAP nuclear shuttling were BIS I and Ro
31-8220, two representatives of the bisindolylmaleimide
family of Ser/Thr kinase inhibitors, as PKCs (Table 1).

Cytoplasmic inducers marginally modulate
YAP co-transcriptional activity
As the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors identified
belong to the family of tyrphostin [26], precursors of
the more potent and clinically used inhibitors of RTKIs,
such as erlotinib and lapatinib, we decided to use these
two drugs for further investigation. Moreover, given
the importance of the constitutive activation of the
RAS pathway in PDAC [27], we also evaluated the
efficacy of ZM336372 in inhibiting YAP-dependent
transcriptional effects by using TEA luciferase reporter
system as a readout. Only erlotinib inhibited modestly,
but significantly, TEA reporter and reduced the expression
level of CTGF but with no efficacy on Cyr61 (Figure 2B,
2C). On the contrary, lapatinib and ZM336372 increased
CTGF and Cyr61 expression levels (Figure 2C). Summing
up, only erlotinib showed a minimal, although significant,
negative modulation of YAP co-transcriptional activity.

Supplementary Figure S1E). BIS I phenocopied the
effects of YAP functional ablation: it slowed down cell
proliferation and induced an accumulation in the S-phase
(Supplementary Figure S1B, S1F). Most importantly,
BIS I was readily effective in reducing the anchorage-

independent growth of PDAC cell lines. Among the four
cell lines tested, PANC1 and MIAPACA2 formed colonies
within two weeks, while PK9 took longer and we could not
detect BXPC3 colony formation. BIS I reduced the total
number of colonies of PANC1, MIAPACA2, and PK9 and
reduced the colony dimensions of PANC1 and PK9 but
increasing MIAPACA2 ones (Figure 4C). Summing up,

hours. Silencing of GSK3β activated TEA reporter only
in the presence of YAP overexpression, similarly to BIS
I treatment (Supplementary Figure S2E) and reduced
the expression of SMAD3 mRNA (Figure 4E) as BIS I
treatment. Since the association of YAP to the destruction
complex has been reported [5], we evaluated the activation
of the WNT/β-catenin signaling in PDAC cell lines
during BIS I treatment. We performed a reporter assay
with a construct expressing luciferase under the control
of tandem repeats of TCF binding site (TOPFlash) or a
mutated one (FOPFlash). BIS I strongly activated WNT/βcatenin reporter activity in all of the PDAC cell lines used
and in HEK293T cells (Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure
S2F) as well as induced the accumulation of β-catenin
in the nucleus (Figure 5B). Coherently, Go9676 did not
activate TCF/LCF reporter nor induced β-Catenin into the
nucleus (Figure 5A, 5B).
Given the importance of YAP and β-Catenin in
regulating differentiation, we investigated if BIS I could
affect the expression levels of stemness markers of PDAC.
In our case, pancreatic stemness gene CD133 was upregulated upon β-Catenin over-expression (Figure 5C).
These stemness genes were down-regulated during BIS I
treatment (Figure 5D), but, interestingly, only CD133 was
affected by YAP and GSK3β ablation (Figure 5E and 5F).
Moreover, YAP overexpression induced the up-regulation
of CD133 that was blocked by BIS I (Figure 5G), therefore
identifying CD133 as a new gene regulated by YAP and
GSK3β. To sum up, BIS I induced YAP and β-Catenin
nuclear accumulation by inhibiting the PKCδ/GSK3β
pathway. Moreover, BIS I treatment decreased the level
of cancer stem cell markers, but only the effect on CD133
could be ascribed to a loss of YAP functionality. Notably, this
gene is a new critical regulator of EMT in PDAC [21,23].

CD133 gene expression is regulated by YAP
and inhibited by BIS I
To further investigate the molecular mechanism
of bisindolylmaleimides leading to YAP nuclear
accumulation, we evaluated four of them for their ability
to modulate CTGF expression levels. BIS I and BIS II
reduced CTGF expression in PK9 and PANC1 cells,
although to a different extent, while Go9676 increased
CTGF expression. BIS IV showed an increase of CTGF
expression only in PK9 cells with no activity in the
other cell lines (Supplementary Figure S2A). None of
the bisindolylmaleimides tested showed toxic effects
(Supplementary Figure S2B). Given the relative specificity
of BIS I for PKCδ/GSK3β, while Go9676 is more specific
for PKCα, we hypothesized that PKCδ/GSK3β ablation
could phenocopy BIS I treatment. Transient silencing of
PKCδ and GSK3β showed that CTGF decreased in both
cases linking the activity of these two kinases in CTGF
expression regulation (Figure 4D, Supplementary Figure
S2C). Short-term treatment with the GSK3β inhibitor LiCl
induced the expression of CTGF mRNA, but long-term
treatment decreased CTGF expression [32]. Interestingly,
the downregulation of SMAD2 mRNA occurred only at
a late time point whereas SMAD3 was already downregulated at 6 hours (Supplementary Figure S2D). BIS I
induced the downregulation of both SMADs already at 6

and de-potentiating YAP contribution to EMT via downregulation of SMAD2/3.
In agreement with previous reports [14,33,34],
we observed that, in PDAC cell lines, YAP mainly
regulates anchorage-independent growth, migration, and
proliferation. However, YAP governs the expression of
only some of the bona fide YAP target genes in these cell
lines as only CTGF and CYR61, but not AREG or BIRC5,
decreased during YAP functional ablation. Indeed, in a
KRAS mutant context, YAP, being post-translationally
modulated by KRAS/MAPK signaling cascade, promotes

relies on the inhibition of the EMT-related, YAP-dependent
transcriptional program (Figure 5G, 7D). In sum, we show
that BIS I inhibits EMT in PDAC cell lines triggering the
expression of epithelium markers by down-regulating
SMAD2/3 and blunting YAP co-transcriptional activity.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we show that BIS I, an inhibitor of the
PKCδ/GSK3β pathway, reverts the EMT transcriptional
program in PDAC cell lines inhibiting the TGFβ pathway

the expression of pro-proliferative secretory factors as
CTGF and CYR61, preferentially [15]. From our smallscale screening of kinase inhibitors, using as reporter
system the localization of the endogenous YAP protein,
we found out that general inhibitors of RTKs and one RAS
inhibitor induced YAP accumulation into the cytoplasm.
This finding suggests a functional link between the
EGFR and RAS pathway and YAP activity as observed
in Drosophila [35], liver carcinoma [36], NSCLC cells
[37] and pancreas itself [16]. Unfortunately, none of these
inhibitors was potent enough to inhibit TEA reporter
system and decrease CTGF expression, suggesting that
the residual amount of nuclear YAP was still active.
Only erlotinib showed a small but significant trend
towards inhibition of YAP co-transcriptional activity.
Indeed, erlotinib arrests NRG1-ERBB4-YAP signaling
in breast cancer cell lines [38], and suggests a further

rationale for the utilization of erlotinib in PDAC [39].
Additionally, we found of interest the behavior of YAP
nuclear accumulators, i.e. bisindolylmaleimides. The
mechanistic explanation can be linked to the pleiotropic
effect of BIS I. One possibility is that BIS I induced arrest
of the proteasome leading to accumulation of β-catenin
[40, 41] and YAP, being both proteins targeted for
degradation. Alternatively, the BIS I induced inhibition
of PKCδ/GSK3β activity can lead to the degradation of
the destruction complex as proved by β-catenin and YAP
nuclear accumulation. Inhibition of the GSK3β by BIS
I led to osteogenic differentiation and suppression of
adipocyte differentiation by β-catenin stabilization [42,
43]. More importantly, these data are in agreement with the
inhibition of the GSK3β by BIO that led to the activation
of YAP/TEAD response [6]. We did not observe a clear
inactivation of the Hippo pathway but a down-regulation

Figure 7: Genetic ablation of YAP and BIS I treatment regulate cell migration. A. BIS I reduces cell migration synergizing

with YAP silencing. Scratch assay was performed in SCR or stably YAP-silenced PANC1 cells. Images of invaded cells at 0, 24, and 48 H
after scratching and treatment with BIS I were taken from a time-lapse sequence of PANC1 cell migration; wounds with consistent shape
within each well were generated using 200 μl tip. Percentage of invaded cells at different time point is indicated (right panels) as calculated
by ImageJ softwre. (*p<0.05 and **p<0.01). B. BIS I down-regulates VIM and ZEB1 mRNAs. PK9 cells were treated with BIS I for
24H. Expression level of VIM and ZEB1 were measured by qRT-PCR. Data are presented as mean±SD. (**p<0.01 versus MOCK). C. BIS
I inhibits TFG-β induced ZEB1 expression. PK9 cells were stably transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding shRNA targeting YAP
(shYAP) or a non-targeting control shRNA (SCR). They were then treated with BIS I 5μM in the presence and absence of TGF-β 50ng/
ml for 24H. The expression levels of ZEB1 was evaluated. (*p<0.05, **p<0.01 and ***p<0.001). D. Overexpression of YAP reverts the
effect of BIS-I on the expression of CTGF, CDH1 and VIM. PK9 cells were transiently co-transfected with YAP and pEGFPN1 plasmids
and treated with BIS I for 24H. CTGF, CDH1, VIM, and ZEB1 expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR. Data are presented as
mean±SD. (*p<0.05 and **p<0.01).

of LATS that explains the nuclear translocation of YAP,
also in an independent manner from the association
to the destruction complex [6]. Indeed, we observed
the activation of the TEA reporter system during BIS I
treatment, but, at the same time, a clear, YAP-dependent,
decrease of CTGF and CYR61 mRNAs. CTGF promoter
region is highly regulated, and several transcription factors
contribute to the activation of this locus. In mesangial and
gingival cells, BIS I blockage of basal and TGFβ-induced
regulation of CTGF [44,45] was explained by inhibition
of GSK3β. Moreover, in hepatocarcinoma cells, PKCδmediated TGFβ signaling led to CTGF expression by
inhibiting the phosphatase PPM1A, which is responsible
for the SMAD2/3 inactivation [46]. Downregulation of
CTGF upon functional ablation of PKCδ and GSK3β
highlights that the similar mechanisms occur in PDAC
cell lines (Figure 4D) and can be explained by SMAD3
mRNA downregulation (Figure 4E). GSK3β inhibition
by LiCl induces a biphasic CTGF expression regulation:
an initial burst of expression, coherent with YAP nuclear
accumulation, is followed by a long-term downregulation
of the gene. This secondary response is likely due to the
parallel downregulation of SMAD2/3 (Supplementary
Figure S2D, S2E). BIS I down-regulated CTGF and
SMAD2/3 already at 6 hours, therefore showing a strong
potency in blocking TGFβ in a SMAD4 deficient context,
a frequent lesion in PDAC [47] and our cell lines. The
same mechanism applies to YAP/SMADs co-regulated
genes and, given the importance of this association in
promoting EMT [48], it explains the specific reversion of
EMT markers. Therefore, the down-regulation of SMADs
dampens the YAP co-transcriptional activity of EMT
genes. Indeed, YAP overexpression rescued phenotypically
the ability to migrate and grow in anchorage-independent
condition, and, molecularly, it inhibited the re-expression
of E-cadherin and blunted the downregulation of CTGF,
CD133, and Vimentin. Additionally, we showed that BIS
I induced displacement of YAP from CTGF promoter,
showing a loss of function of nuclear YAP on specific
genes, likely driven by the loss of SMADs partner. Finally,
we observed that BIS I induced the downregulation of
many cancer stem genes, CD133 included, and we found
that this new marker of EMT is highly regulated as YAP,
GSK3β, and β-catenin modulated CD133 expression,
addressing this gene as a co-regulated gene by these three
factors. Further experiments are necessary to clarify this
point. However, it suggests that inhibition of the SRC
pathway via dasatinib [23,49] may influence EMT in
PDAC by modulating YAP activity.

incubated for 72H before collection for WB. Stable silent
cells were selected using 3 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) in
the culture medium.

Cells were treated for 24H then they were
lysed in cold modified cytosolic lysis buffer (10mM
HEPES pH 7.0, 10mM KCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5%
NP-40, 1mM DTT, and Protease inhibitor cocktail). The
supernatant containing cytosolic fraction was collected by
centrifugation at 3000xg for 5 minutes at 4°C. Nuclear
pellets were then re-suspended in cold modified nuclear
lysis buffer (10mM HEPES pH 7.0, 400mM NaCl,
1mM EDTA, 25% Glycerol, 1mM DTT, and Protease
inhibitor cocktail). The nuclear extract was harvested by
centrifugation at 12000xg for 15 minutes at 4°C. Equal
quantities of proteins were separated by electrophoresis
on a 12% SDS-page gels. The blots were incubated with
YAP1, Phospho-YAP-1 (Ser127), β-catenin antibodies
overnight at 4°C. β-actin and Lamin A/C served as the
loading controls for the cytosolic and nuclear fraction,
respectively.
Luciferase reporter assay. HEK293T, PK9 and
PANC1 were seeded in 24 well-plates then indicated
plasmids were co-transfected using Lipofectamine 3000
(Invitrogen) or TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus).
After transfection (24H), cells were treated with BIS
family compounds including GF 109203X or BIS I (5μM),
Go6976 (5μM), Erlotinib (5μM), Lapatinib (5 μM), and
PMA (1 μM) for 24H. Cells were lysed and luciferase
activity was assayed using the enhanced luciferase assay
kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The firefly luciferase activity levels were measure and
normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.

Immunofluorescence staining and drug screening
PK9 and PANC1 cells were cultured sparsely
(LOW) and densely (HIGH) onto glass cover slides and in
96 well-plate for 48 H. Cells were fixed and localization
of YAP was visualized and nuclei were counterstained
with DAPI. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed
using a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope equipped with
Apotome module, with a Plan Apochromatic (63X, NA
1.4) objective. Images were acquired using Zen 1.1 (blue
edition) imaging software (Zeiss) and assembled with
Adobe Photoshop CS3. Drug screening, PK9 cells were
seeded on OptiPlate-96 Black, Black Opaque 96-well
Microplate (PerkinElmer) at a density of 5000 cells/well,
to obtain a 70% confluence at the end of the assay. The
library of known kinase inhibitors was re-suspended in
DMSO and diluted in PBS 1X. The compounds were
administrated at the final concentration of 1μM for 24H.
Cells were fixed as previously described [52], primary
antibody against YAP (1:500) and secondary fluorophore
conjugated (Alexa 488) antibody (1:10000) were diluted in
PBS + BSA 0.2%. DAPI (1.5 μg/ml) in PBS + BSA 0.2%
was used to detect nuclei. PerkinElmer image plate reader
Operetta was used for imaging and evaluation. The ratio
between nuclear and cytoplasmic signal represents the
mean of single cells for every well and it were normalized
to untreated control. The Z score was calculated to
evaluate the significance of results from the screening. Z
score was calculated as follow: Z = (X–mean)/standard
deviation. X = normalized sample ratio [51].

RNA isolation, real-time PCR and ChIP assay
Total RNA was extracted using RNA isolation
Mini Kit (Agilent Technologies and successively treated
with RNA-free DNase. RNA was subjected for reverse
transcription (RT) with iScript reverse transcriptase (Biorad). cDNA was then diluted and 50ng total of cDNA was
used for qRT-PCR with gene-specific primers using KAPA
SYBR FAST qPCR master mix (Kapa biosystem) or HOT
FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR Mix (Solis BioDyne). Relative
abundance of mRNA was calculated by normalization
to GAPDH mRNA. The reactions were carried out on
a CFX96TM real-time system (BIO-RAD). For ChIP
assay, DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform/
isoamyl alcohol, ethanol precipitated and re-suspended
in water. In mRNA expression experiments, Ct values
of every gene were normalized to the housekeeping
GAPDH, while in ChIP assays, the normalization were
calculated by the following formula: (X–IgG)/INPUT,
where X is the Ct of the sequence of interest derived
from the immunoprecipitated DNA bound to the protein
of interest; IgG is the Ct of the same sequence derived
from the DNA immunoprecipitated with an irrelevant
antibody and INPUT is the Ct derived from the total DNA

cycle was measured by FACS analysis at 24H after
treatment using propidium iodide (PI) staining. Real time
cell proliferation assay: PK9 were seeded 5000 cells/well
in E-plates (Roche), in triplicates. The cell growth curves
were automatically recorded on the xCELLigence System
(Roche) in real time. The cell attachment was monitored
every 15 minutes by a cell electronic system. The doubling
times were calculated according with cell index. The
cell index is an arbitrary unit for displaying inpedence.
