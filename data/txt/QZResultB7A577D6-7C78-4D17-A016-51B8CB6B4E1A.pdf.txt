Abstract
Bone metastasis affects more than 70% of advanced breast
cancer patients, but the molecular mechanisms of this process
remain unclear. Here, we present clinical and experimental
evidence to clarify the role of the integrin b-like 1 (ITGBL1)
as a key contributor to bone metastasis of breast cancer. In an in
vivo model system and in vitro experiments, ITGBL1 expression
promoted formation of osteomimetic breast cancers, facilitating recruitment, residence, and growth of cancer cells in bone
microenvironment along with osteoclast maturation there to
form osteolytic lesions. Mechanistic investigations identiﬁed

the TGFb signaling pathway as a downstream effector of
ITGBL1 and the transcription factor Runx2 as an upstream
activator of ITGBL1 expression. In support of these ﬁndings,
we also found that ITGBL1 was an essential mediator of Runx2induced bone metastasis of breast cancer. Overall, our results
illuminate how bone metastasis occurs in breast cancer, and
they provide functional evidence for new candidate biomarkers
and therapeutic targets to identify risk, to prevent, and to treat
this dismal feature of advanced breast cancer. Cancer Res; 75(16);

Introduction

EGF-like stalk fragment of integrin b (4), but contains neither a
transmembrane domain nor an RGD (Arg–Gly–Asp)-binding
domain, suggesting that ITGBL1 performs functions distinct
from those of integrin. In our previous gene-expression proﬁling dataset of breast cancer tissues, ITGBL1 was coexpressed
with genes encoding proteins involved in bone remodeling and
bone metastasis (5). Garcia and colleagues (6) found that
ITGBL1 is overexpressed in bone metastatic subclone cells
compared with their parental cells and is included in the
"osteoblast-like gene expression signature" and "bone metastatic gene signature." These evidences implied that ITGBL1
might contribute to the development of the osteoblast-like
(osteomimetic) phenotype and bone metastasis of breast cancer cells. Currently, information regarding the role and molecular mechanism of ITGBL1 expressed by breast cancer cells in
bone metastasis remains limited.
Runx2 is a critical transcription factor for osteogenic lineage
commitment and bone formation. It switches on the expression of
several bone matrix–remodeling genes by binding to the osteoblast-speciﬁc cis-acting element 2 (OSE2; refs. 7, 8). Runx2 and its
target genes are highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and play
pivotal roles in breast cancer bone metastasis (9–12). On the basis
of the evidence that ITGBL1 is coexpressed with RUNX2 in breast
cancer cells (6) and the fact that there are OSE2 motifs in the
ITGBL1 promoter, we hypothesized that ITGBL1 might be a
transcriptional target of Runx2 and mediate Runx2-driven bone
metastasis.
In this study, we present both in vivo and in vitro evidence to
clarify the roles and the underlying molecular mechanisms of
ITGBL1 in breast cancer bone metastasis. Moreover, we identify
ITGBL1 as a transcriptional target of Runx2, mediating
the Runx2-driven bone metastatic potential of breast cancer
cells.

Breast cancer cells preferentially metastasize to the bone, leading to osteolytic lesions. To form visible metastatic bone lesions,
breast cancer cells undergo processes, including recruitment to the
bone, survival, and clonal expansion in the bone microenvironment, as well as osteoclast activation to resorb the bone matrix
(1). Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the ectopic expression of bone-remodeling genes or gene signatures in primary
breast cancer cells increases the risk of bone metastasis (2);
however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely
unknown.
Integrin beta-like 1 (ITGBL1), which was ﬁrst cloned and
characterized from an osteoblast cDNA library (3), encodes a
ten integrin EGF-like repeat domain-containing protein (TIED).
The ITGBL1 protein is highly homologous to the N-terminal

ITGBL1 in Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis

Materials and Methods
Patients and tissue samples
A total of 88 primary breast cancer tissue specimens were
collected from breast cancer patients who developed distant
metastases within a 5-year follow-up period. Of these patients,
10 patients developed bone-only metastasis, and the other 78
patients suffered other organ metastases with or without bone
metastasis. The use of these tissues was approved by the
Institutional Review Board and the Research Ethics Committee
of Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital
(TMUCIH), and written consent was obtained from all
participants.
Cells and treatment
The human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells, osteoblast-like MG-63 cells, immortalized lung epithelial BEAS-2B
cells, and mouse osteoclast precursor RAW 264.7 cells were
obtained from the ATCC. To block the TGFb signaling pathway,
cells were treated with 1.0 mmol/L SB-431542 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in DMSO or with an equal amount of DMSO
as control.
In vitro chemotaxis assays
In vitro cell chemotaxis assays were performed using Boyden
chamber inserts (BD Biosciences). A total of 2.5  104 cancer cells
were seeded in the upper chambers and allowed to migrate toward
80% conﬂuent MG-63 or BEAS-2B cells in the bottom chambers
for 12 hours (MDA-MB-231) or 30 hours (T47D). Then, the
migrated cells were ﬁxed, stained, and counted.
In vitro osteoclastogenesis assays
Primary preosteoclasts were isolated from bone marrow cells
ﬂushed from the tibias of 6-week-old wild-type Balb/c mice and
cultured overnight in aMEM with 10% FBS. A total of 5  105
nonadherent cells were plated in a 24-well plate supplemented
with 50 ng/mL macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF;
PeproTech) for 2 days and then cultured with cancer cell
conditioned media (CM) containing 50 ng/mL receptor activator of NFkB ligand (RANKL; PeproTech) for 5 additional
days. Osteoclast precursor RAW 264.7 cells were induced for
the ﬁrst 4 days with 50 ng/mL RANKL and then cultured with
cancer cell CM containing RANKL for another 3 days. Multinuclear cells that stained positive for tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase (TRAP) were scored as mature osteoclasts.
Animal experiments
ITGBL1–GFP-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells or control
cells were injected into the left cardiac ventricle (1.0  106; ref.
13), the cortex of the right tibia (1.0  106; ref. 14), or the left
lower abdominal mammary fat pad (5.0  106) of 5-week-old
female SCID mice. The formation of tumors and metastases was
observed and assessed by bioluminescence imaging using a
Xenogen IVIS 200 Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences) at weeks
4 and 8. At week 8, the mice were sacriﬁced to observe osteolytic
lesions using an X-ray and SkyScan microCT system (Bruker,
Eschborn, GER). Metastases in the lung, liver, and bone were
observed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. TRAP staining was used to identify the mature osteoclasts in metastatic bone
lesions. The animal experiment protocols were approved by the
Animal Ethics Committee of TMUCIH.

Statistical analysis
Kaplan–Meier survival curves and the log-rank test were used to
evaluate the bone metastasis outcomes of patients with different
ITGBL1 expression proﬁles. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used
to determine the differences in the ITGBL1 expression values
among different groups. A repeated measure ANOVA was used
to compare the differences in the proliferation capabilities of
cancer cells. All other comparisons were determined using the
two-tailed Student t test.

Results
ITGBL1 is coexpressed with a set of genes related to bone
remodeling and bone metastasis in primary breast cancer
tissues
On the basis of our previous gene expression proﬁling dataset
(5) of breast cancer tissues and the GOBO (15) dataset (Fig. 1A),
we found that ITGBL1 was coexpressed with a set of genes related
to bone remodeling and bone metastasis encoding the osteoblastspeciﬁc transcription factor Runx2; osteoblast-speciﬁc adhesion
molecules OB-Cadherin/CDH11 and integrins (ITG); bone
matrix proteins, including collagens (COL), osteoblast-speciﬁc
factor 2 (OSF-2) and osteoglycin (OGN); and the growth factors
TGFb3 and bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1). These results
suggest that ITGBL1 may contribute to the formation of "osteomimetic" breast cancer, which is characterized by the ectopic
expression of bone remodeling-related factors and the properties
of bone metastasis (16, 17).
Breast cancers with high ITGBL1 expression levels are prone to
metastasize to bone
Because of the coexpression of ITGBL1 with a set of genes
related to bone remodeling and bone metastasis, we questioned
whether ITGBL1 expression is involved in bone metastasis. We
used RT-qPCR to quantify the mRNA expression levels of ITGBL1
in 88 primary breast cancers that developed distant metastases
within a 5-year follow-up period. The optimized cutoff value was
used to group the patients into a low ITGBL1 mRNA group
(ITGBL1low) and a high ITGBL1 group (ITGBL1high). The incidence of bone-only metastasis in the ITGBL1high group (17.0%;
9/53) was signiﬁcantly higher than in the ITGBL1low group (2.9%;
1/35). Patients in the ITGBL1high group had higher risks of boneonly metastasis than patients in the ITGBL1low group [OR, 5.4;
95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 0.7–42.8; P ¼ 0.072; Fig. 1B]. Next,
the combined Wang–Minn microarray dataset (18, 19) revealed
that the tumors developing bone metastasis expressed signiﬁcantly higher ITGBL1 mRNA levels than those with non-bone metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). The incidences of both
bone metastasis and bone-only metastasis (25.4% and 22.4%,
respectively) were signiﬁcantly higher in the ITGBL1high group
than in the ITGBL1low group (14.4% and 8.5%, respectively). In
addition, patients in the ITGBL1high group had higher risks of
bone metastasis (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0–3.0; P ¼ 0.033) and boneonly metastasis (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3–5.0; P ¼ 0.005) than
patients in the ITGBL1low group (Fig. 1B and C). Interestingly,
we found a negative link between ITGBL1 mRNA levels and nonbone metastases (lung and brain metastases; Fig. 1B and C;
Supplementary Fig. S1C–S1E). Taken together, these results provide clinical evidence for the role of ITGBL1 in facilitating
the bone-speciﬁc metastasis of breast cancer. Moreover, on
the basis of the Zhang and colleagues dataset (20), the ITGBL1

mRNA expression levels in bone metastatic tissues were signiﬁcantly higher than in metastatic tissues of other organs (Fig. 1D).
All of the bone metastatic tumor samples (18/18) were sorted into
the ITGBL1high group, and none of these samples was included in
the ITGBL1low group (Fig. 1E). Thus, this clinical evidence further
suggests that high ITGBL1 expression may help breast cancer cells
to survive in the bone microenvironment and facilitate the bone
metastasis of breast cancer.
ITGBL1 contributes to the seeding of bone metastases of cancer
cells and osteolytic bone lesions
Taking into account of the potential effect of tumorigenicity on
the metastatic capability of cancer cells, ITGBL1-overexpressing
MDA-MB-231 cells and control cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of mice. We observed a similar tumorigenicity of
ITGBL1-overexpressing cells (5/5) with the control cells (5/5),

3304 Cancer Res; 75(16) August 15, 2015

although ITGBL1-overexpressing cells lead to smaller tumors than
the control cells (Fig. 2A). Then, considering the high correlation
of ITGBL1 and bone metastasis in clinical breast cancer cases, we
speculated that ITGBL1 in breast cancer cells could endow tumor
cells with the ability to seed bones as these cells disseminated in
the circulation. We inoculated ITGBL1–GFP-overexpressing
MDA-MB-231 cells or control cells into the left cardiac ventricle
of SCID mice. The incidence of bone metastasis generated by
ITGBL1-overexpressing cells was 75% (3/4) at 90 days (Fig. 2B
and C), which is higher than the incidences generated by the
control cells (0/3; Fig. 2C) and the parental MDA-MB-231 cells
(31% at 100 days) reported by Kang and colleagues (21). Moreover, ITGBL1-overexpressing cancer cells led to serious osteolytic
bone lesions with a greater number of TRAPþ osteoclasts, but
reduced lung metastasis (1/4; Fig. 2B–E), whereas all mice (3/3) in
the control group died of serious lung metastasis within 40 days

(Fig. 2B–E) without detectable bone metastasis by either X-ray
imaging or H&E staining. Combining with the evidence that the
ITGBL1-overexpressing cells and control cells are similarly tumorigenic, these observations exclude the possibility that overexpression of ITGBL1 reduces lethal lung metastasis by decreasing
tumorigenicity of cancer cells and indicate a selective and speciﬁc
role for ITGBL1 in the seeding of breast cancer cells in bone. We
also observed more serious bone lesions in the right tibia and a
greater number of TRAPþ osteoclasts along the bone–tumor
interface of bone lesions in the ITGBL1-overexpressing group
with intratibial injection (Fig. 2F and G), indicating activated
osteoclasts induced by ITGBL1-overexpressing tumor cells. Surprisingly, all mice in the control group with intratibial injection
developed lung metastasis, whereas no mice in the ITGBL1-overexpressing group developed non-bone metastases (lung or liver
metastasis; Fig. 2C and F). These results suggest that ITGBL1overexpressing cancer cells were more likely to arrest in the bone
and that they had a greater survival advantage in the bone
microenvironment than control cells. However, some of the
control cancer cells entered the circulating blood rather than
arresting in bone and then disseminated to the lung and liver.

ﬁed, including 19 bone metastasis-related genes identiﬁed by
Kang and colleagues (21), 13 osteoblast-like breast cancer gene
markers identiﬁed by Bellahcene and colleagues (16), 4 receptors
for chemotactic factors, 3 proliferation-related genes, and several
genes involved in ECM remodeling and bone metastasis-related
signaling pathways (Supplementary Table S2). Then, we demonstrated that ITGBL1 KD reversed the osteomimetic phenotype and
further weakened the bone metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231
cells by clustering the expression proﬁling of ITGBL1 KD subclones, control cells and parental cells based on Bellahcene and
colleagues osteoblast-like signature (16) and Kang and colleagues
bone metastasis signature (21), as shown in Supplementary Fig.
S2B. Using immunoblotting and RT-qPCR, we identiﬁed adhesion molecules involved in bone metastasis, including integrin a5
(ITGA5; refs. 22, 23) and CD44 (24), and the osteomimetic
markers osteopontin (OPN), bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteonectin (OSN), and OSF-2 that decreased in ITGBL1 KD cells and
increased in ITGBL1-overexpressing cells compared with their
control cells (Fig. 3G and Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D).
Taken together, these results provide a suitable molecular basis for
ITGBL1 activity in promoting the bone metastasis of breast cancer.

ITGBL1 facilitates breast cancer cell recruitment to osteoblasts
in vitro
We tested the ability of two ITGBL1 knockdown (KD) MDAMB-231 subclones (ITGBL1 KD1 and ITGBL1 KD2), two ITGBL1overexpressing MDA-MB-231 subclones (ITGBL1-1 and ITGBL12), ITGBL1-overexpressing T47D cells (ITGBL1), and their respective control cells to migrate toward osteoblast-like MG-63 cells or
lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells using a Transwell chemotaxis assay
in vitro to investigate whether ITGBL1 facilitates cancer cells
homing to bone. As shown in Fig. 3A, ITGBL1 KD reduced the
chemotactic migration of MDA-MB-231 cells toward MG-63 cells.
Conversely, ITGBL1 overexpression increased the chemotactic
migration of both MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells toward MG-63
cells (Fig. 3A). However, ITGBL1 KD increased and ITGBL1 overexpression decreased the chemotactic migration of cancer cells
toward BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 3B). Considering the potential role of
ITGBL1 in the formation of osteomimetic breast cancer, we
speculated that osteomimetic breast cancer with high ITGBL1
expression might adapt to survive in the bone rather than in the
lung. Therefore, we assessed the colony formation and proliferation capabilities of ITGBL1 KD and ITGBL1-overexpressing cells,
as well as their respective control cells, in CM from MG-63 and
BEAS-2B cells, which were used to mimic the bone and lung
microenvironment. ITGBL1 KD reduced both of the anchorageindependent and anchorage-dependent survival and proliferation
capacity of cancer cells in MG-63 CM, but increased the anchorage-independent survival in BEAS-2B CM (Fig. 3C–F and Supplementary Fig. S2A). In contrast, ITGBL1 overexpression
enhanced the survival and proliferation of cancer cells in MG63 CM and weakened their survival in BEAS-2B CM (Fig. 3C–F and
Supplementary Fig. S2A). These results provide in vitro evidence
that ITGBL1 plays important roles in cancer cell recruitment to
bone and in survival and growth in the bone microenvironment.
To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of ITGBL1 in
the bone metastasis of breast cancer cells, we performed gene
expression proﬁling of two ITGBL1 KD subclones, control cells
and parental MDA-MB-231 cells by cDNA microarray analysis.
Differentially expressed genes with more than 2-fold changes in
ITGBL1 KD subclones compared with control cells were identi-

ITGBL1 contributes to osteoclastogenesis in the bone
microenvironment
Because of the osteolytic characteristics of breast cancer, we
further investigated whether ITGBL1 in breast cancer cells contributes to osteoclast formation and differentiation. We isolated
primary preosteoclasts from bone marrow cells of mice and
induced them with cancer cell CM in the presence of RANKL. No
signiﬁcant changes in the number of TRAPþ cells were observed in
the primary osteoclast cultures with cancer cell CM with different
ITGBL1 expression levels. However, TRAPþ osteoclasts induced by
the CM from ITGBL1 KD cells were signiﬁcantly smaller than
those induced by the CM from control cells, and the CM of
ITGBL1-overexpressing cells induced larger TRAPþ osteoclasts
than the CM of the control vector cells (Fig. 4A and B). We also
observed the osteoclastogenesis from osteoclast precursor cell line
RAW264.7 cultured with the CM of cancer cells with different
ITGBL1 expression levels in the presence of RANKL. TRAP staining
showed signiﬁcantly decreased numbers of TRAPþ multinuclear
cells among the RAW 264.7 cells cultured with the CM of ITGBL1
KD cells compared with those cultured with CM from control cells
(Fig. 4C and D). The TRAPþ osteoclasts induced by CM from
ITGBL1 KD cells were signiﬁcantly smaller and contained fewer
nuclei than those induced by the CM from control cells (Fig. 4E
and F). Conversely, CM from ITGBL1-overexpressing cells
induced more TRAPþ osteoclasts with larger sizes and more nuclei
than the CM of the control vector cells (Fig. 4C–F). Taken together,
these results suggest that cancer cells with high ITGBL1 expression
promoted osteoclast formation and differentiation. Next, we
sought to identify osteoclast-activating cytokines affected by
ITGBL1 in breast cancer using a human cytokine antibody array
and gene expression proﬁle microarray. The mRNA expression
levels of interleukins and the secreted protein levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), growthregulated alpha protein (GRO), IL1a, monocyte chemotactic
protein (MCP) 1, MCP-3, and macrophage stimulating protein
alpha (MSP-a) were decreased in the CM of ITGBL1 KD cells
compared with the CM of control cells (Supplementary Table S2
and Fig. 4G). The expression levels of RANKL, a pivotal activator
of osteoclastogenesis, decreased in the ITGBL1 KD cells and

TGFb mediates the function of ITGBL1 in bone metastasis of
breast cancer
Considering the positive correlation between the expression
levels of ITGBL1 and TGFB3 (Fig. 1A) and the downregulation of
six genes encoding TGFb signaling pathway molecules after
ITGBL1 KD (Supplementary Table S2), we speculated that TGFb
signaling mediated the ITGBL1-induced promotion of breast
cancer bone metastasis. Indeed, we observed increased secretion
of TGFb1 and TGFb3 by ITGBL1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5A).
Further immunoﬂuorescent staining showed that Smad2 translocated into the nuclei of ITGBL1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5B),
and a Smad2 luciferase reporter assay conﬁrmed that Smad2
transcriptional activity was elevated by ITGBL1 overexpression
(Fig. 5C), suggesting that the TGFb/Smad signaling pathway was
activated in ITGBL1-overexpressing cells. Then, we used the
TGFb receptor inhibitor SB-431542 to block the TGFb/Smad
signaling pathway (Fig. 5C). Consistent with TGFb/Smad signaling pathway activity, the chemotactic responses of MDAMB-231 cells toward MG-63 cells (Fig. 5D) and the stimulation
of osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 5E) were increased by ITGBL1 overexpression and inhibited by SB-431542 treatment. Molecularly,

RANKL and mRNA transcripts of CDH11, OPN, OSN were
upregulated in ITGBL1-overexpressed cells, and these changes
were reversed by blocking the TGFb signaling pathway (Fig. 5F,
Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). These results suggest that the
TGFb signaling pathway mediates the role of ITGBL1 in breast
cancer bone metastasis.
ITGBL1 is a transcriptional target of Runx2
Because Runx2 is a key transcription factor during bone development and ITGBL1 is coexpressed with RUNX2 and Runx2regulated bone remodeling-related genes in primary breast cancer
tissues, we investigated whether ITGBL1 was regulated by Runx2.
Indeed, through a sequence search of the ITGBL1 promoter, we
found three OSE2 elements in the proximal promoter region of
ITGBL1: 793 to 786, 1208 to 1201 and 1320 to 1295
(Fig. 6A). We performed a ChIP assay to enrich the Runx2-bound
DNA fragments and found that Runx2 bound the ITGBL1
promoter region containing the 793/786 site but not the
1320/1295 or 1208/1201 site (Fig. 6B).
We further investigated the regulatory activity of Runx2 on the
ITGBL1 promoter using dual-luciferase reporter assays and found
that ITGBL1 promoter activity decreased in the MDA-MB-231 cells

(Fig. 6C). Moreover, we also performed dual-luciferase reporter
assays to compare the ITGBL1 promoter activity upon the transient transfection of pGL3-ITGBL1 825/þ36 in a stable subclone
of MDA-MB-231 with that in shRNA-mediated Runx2 KD, Runx2overexpressing cells, and their control cells. Runx2 KD weakened
and Runx2 overexpression enhanced the activity of the ITGBL1
promoter compared with their respective control cells (Fig. 6D).
Together, these results demonstrate that Runx2 regulates the
activity of the ITGBL1 promoter by binding to the OSE2 element
at 793 to 786.
To further conﬁrm the regulatory effect of Runx2 on ITGBL1
transcription levels, the mRNA expression levels of ITGBL1 in
Runx2 KD cells, Runx2-overexpressing cells, and their corresponding control cells were measured by RT-qPCR. The ITGBL1
mRNA expression level was downregulated in Runx2 KD cells
and upregulated in Runx2-overexpressing cells compared with
their respective control cells (Fig. 6E). These results conﬁrm that
ITGBL1 is a positively regulated transcriptional target of Runx2.

ITGBL1 mediates Runx2-driven bone metastasis of breast
cancer cells
Once ITGBL1 was conﬁrmed as a Runx2 target gene that plays
pivotal roles in breast cancer bone metastasis, we further investigated whether ITGBL1 mediates the Runx2-driven bone metastasis of breast cancer cells. The chemotactic migration assay
showed that Runx2 overexpression signiﬁcantly increased the
chemotactic migration of MDA-MB-231 cells toward MG-63 cells.
ITGBL1 KD in Runx2-overexpressing cells reversed the Runx2induced chemotactic migration phenotype (Fig. 7A). We also
observed that the chemotactic migration of MDA-MB-231 cells
toward MG-63 cells was signiﬁcantly reduced by Runx2 KD and
was rescued by the accompanying ITGBL1 overexpression
(Fig. 7A). The culture of preosteoclast RAW 264.7 cells with CM
from Runx2-overexpressing cells induced more and larger TRAPþ
osteoclasts with more nuclei than did control medium (Fig. 7B).
Moreover, osteoclast differentiation induced by the Runx2-overexpressing cells was attenuated by ITGBL1 KD (Fig. 7B). Consistently, the CM of Runx2 KD cancer cells reduced osteoclast
differentiation in the primary osteoclast culture system, and
ITGBL1 overexpression recovered the capability of Runx2 KD
cancer cells to activate osteoclasts (Fig. 7C). These phenotypes

were also conﬁrmed by the expression of mRNA markers and
protein markers related to bone metastasis and osteoclastogenesis
as detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7D and Supplementary
Fig. S3C–S3E). Taken together, these results demonstrate that
ITGBL1 mediates the role of Runx2 in promoting the capability of
breast cancer cells to form bone metastasis.

Discussion
The present study provides clinical and experimental evidence
for a role of ITGBL1 in conferring a bone-speciﬁc metastasis
capability to breast cancer cells. ITGBL1 is highly expressed in
bone metastatic tumor cells, as well as in primary cancer cells with
bone metastasis capabilities. ITGBL1 facilitates the acquisition of
tumor cell advantages in recruiting, residing, and growth in bone
and further stimulates osteoclast maturation in the bone microenvironment to form bone metastatic lesions. We also identiﬁed a
fundamental mechanism of ITGBL1 in bone metastasis via TGFb
pathway activation. Moreover, ITGBL1, as a transcriptional target
of Runx2, mediates the role of Runx2 in promoting breast cancer
bone metastasis.
Tropism and adhesion are crucial steps in the communication
and interaction between breast cancer cells and the bone matrix or
host cells in bone. Both clinical data and animal experiments
demonstrated the role of ITGBL1 in organ selectivity to the bone
during breast cancer metastasis. Furthermore, our evidence that
ITGBL1 regulates the expression of chemokine receptor 4
(CXCR4), integrin av, and CD44 on the surface of breast cancer
cells supports the function of ITGBL1 in promoting the bone

tropism of breast cancer cells. The chemokine (C-X-C motif)
ligand 12 (CXCL12/SDF-1a) and CXCR4 axis is a well-known
chemotactic mechanism for breast cancer cell metastasis to bone
(21, 25). CXCL12 is expressed at high levels by osteoblasts and
bone marrow stromal cells and recruits CXCR4-positive cancer
cells to bone marrow (26). Integrin av on the surface of bone
metastatic breast cancer cells binds to RGD domain-containing
bone matrix proteins such as OPN, BSP, COLs, thus leading to
breast cancer cell adhesion to bone (27–29). CD44, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is a major adhesion molecule for the extracellular matrix (ECM) that binds primarily to the extracellular
glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA). HA is a major non-protein
glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM in human bone
matrix, and the interaction of CD44 and HA facilitates tumor
cell arrest and colonization in bone, leading to increased bone
metastasis (24, 30).
Metastatic cancer cells that home and localize to the bone
marrow can remain dormant (31, 32) until they are activated to
colonize and grow into visible metastatic bone lesions. In this
study, we found that ITGBL1 was highly expressed in clinical bone
metastatic tumors and that ITGBL1 enhanced the colony formation and proliferation capability of cancer cells in a bone-mimicking microenvironment, emphasizing its roles in the potential
reprogramming to activate quiescent cancer cells and survival
advantage in bone microenvironment. One explanation for this
survival advantage is the osteomimetic aspect of cancer cells.
Osteomimetic properties of breast cancer cells include the ectopic
expression of bone matrix proteins and osteoblast-speciﬁc adhesion molecules, and even mineralization under appropriate

conditions (16, 17). These osteoblast-like features allow cancer
cells to reside in bone due to their escape from immune surveillance in the bone microenvironment (6, 16, 17). Combining the
report that ITGBL1 was identiﬁed as a gene in the osteoblast-like
gene-expression signature (6) with our ﬁnding that ITGBL1
increased the expression of osteomimetic markers, we propose
that ITGBL1 contributes to osteomimetic breast cancer, and
therefore facilitates cancer cells preferentially residing in and
colonizing the bone microenvironment. Moreover, ITGBL1 positively regulated the cell proliferation-related genes KI67 and
CCNE, suggesting that ITGBL1 can also confer a proliferation
advantage to tumor cells in the bone microenvironment.
Most breast cancer metastases in bone cause osteolytic lesions.
Continuous expansion of osteolytic bone metastasis is driven by
the "vicious cycle" of tumor-dependent activation of bonedegrading osteoclasts and bone stroma-dependent stimulation
of tumor malignancy (22, 31). Osteoclasts are derived from
precursors in the mononuclear-phagocyte lineage and are responsible for bone resorption. RANKL, primarily produced by osteoblasts and cancer cells, binds to its cognate receptor RANK on
osteoclast precursors and plays a critical role in promoting osteoclast differentiation and activation, leading to bone resorption
(33). Osteoprotegerin is a soluble decoy receptor for RANKL that
blocks osteoclast formation by inhibiting the binding of RANKL
to RANK (33). Indeed, we observed that high ITGBL1 expression
in cancer cells promoted osteoclast activation in vitro and osteolytic lesions in vivo. Consistent with that phenotype, ITGBL1overexpressing cancer cells showed elevated levels of RANKL and
decreased expression of osteoprotegerin. Moreover, ITGBL1 positively regulated the secretion of the osteoclast differentiation
activators GM-CSF (34), GRO (35), IL1a (36), MCPs (37), and
MSP-a (38) in cancer cells, providing additional evidence supporting the role of ITGBL1 in cancer cell–triggered osteolytic
lesions in bone metastatic events.
The role of the TGFb signaling pathway in bone metastasis has
been clearly outlined. TGFbs promote the formation of osteomimetic breast cancer by inducing the expression of bone matrix
proteins (17) and also contribute to the "vicious cycle" and
osteoclastic resorption (22). In this study, we found that ITGBL1
increased the expression and secretion of TGFb1 and TGFb3 in
breast cancer cells. Blockade of the TGFb pathway by SB431542
weakened the ITGBL1-induced bone metastatic potential of breast
cancer cells, suggesting a modulatory role for the TGFb pathway in
ITGBL1-driven bone-speciﬁc breast cancer metastasis. However,
the detailed mechanism of TGFb upregulation and TGFb pathway
activation by ITGBL1 need to be further explored in future studies.

Runx2 is regarded as a pivotal transcription factor for the
formation of the osteomimetic phenotype (39, 40) and contributes to cancer cell dissemination into the blood, survival in the
bone microenvironment, and stimulation of bone resorption (41,
42). Expression of Runx2 target genes, including OPN, BSP, and
osteocalcin, appears to confer osteomimetic features upon breast
cancer cells, and is reported to play important roles in breast
cancer bone metastasis (39). In this study, we identiﬁed ITGBL1 as
a novel Runx2 target gene and demonstrated that ITGBL1 exhibits
properties similar to Runx2 in promoting the formation of osteomimetic breast cancer and mediates the Runx2-induced conferral
of bone metastasis capability on cancer cells.
In conclusion, our study revealed a new molecular mechanism
that promotes breast cancer metastasis to the bone. We also
identiﬁed an activator of the TGFb signaling pathway and a key
mediator of Runx2 in bone metastasis. Importantly, we provided
preclinical evidence for ITGBL1 as a molecular marker to predict
bone metastasis risk and as a therapeutic target against breast
cancer bone metastasis.
