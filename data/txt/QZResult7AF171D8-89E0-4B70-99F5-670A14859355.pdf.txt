sensitive methods are required for monitoring residual disease (ie, molecular
monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels). It is generally accepted that molecular
responses have prognostic significance. Patients with CP CML who achieve early
molecular responses are more likely to achieve durable cytogenetic responses
and are less likely to experience disease progression. Rising BCR-ABL transcript
levels also indicate loss of response, often as a consequence of developing BCRABL mutations. However, some studies have suggested that patients who achieve
complete cytogenetic disease remission may not derive an additional prognostic
benefit from achieving a major molecular response. Practical issues also exist for
molecular monitoring with respect to restricted access and variability in methodologies and data reporting. Although molecular monitoring has a clear role in
assessing residual disease and determining the risk of disease progression in
patients with CML, the importance of cytogenetic monitoring should not be
ignored. Cancer 2008;112:2112–8.  2008 American Cancer Society.

hronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by a consistent
cytogenetic abnormality known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is generated by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, causing the ABL gene
(encoding a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase) to fuse to the BCR gene.
The resulting BCR-ABL oncogene encodes a protein with constitutive and aberrant Abl tyrosine kinase activity, which has been shown
to play a causal role in CML.1,2 Bcr-Abl mediates the development
and maintenance of CML through interaction with multiple downstream signaling partners, resulting in altered cellular adhesion, activation of mitogenic signaling, and inhibition of apoptosis, leading to
the transformation of hematopoietic stem cells. Bcr-Abl signaling is
also associated with defective DNA repair, which results in additional chromosomal alterations and mutations, and may partly
explain the aggressive nature of advanced CML.3
Targeted inhibition of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity inhibits
proliferation and induces apoptosis in Bcr-Abl–expressing human
cells in vitro.4,5 Current drug treatments for CML, such as imatinib

(Tasinga; Novartis), aim to control disease by inhibiting Bcr-Abl activity and decreasing the number of
Bcr-Abl–positive cells. Continuous monitoring of disease levels in individual patients is required to determine the effectiveness of specific therapies so that
timely and appropriate decisions can be made
regarding treatment strategy. Achieving defined levels
of response (reductions in residual disease) within
specified timeframes has prognostic significance,
both in terms of the durability of treatment
responses and progression-free survival (PFS).6 Molecular assessment of BCR-ABL transcript levels is
widely used for monitoring CML disease status, and
there are accumulating reports of molecular
responses achieved with available treatments and
associated prognostic benefits. However, there are
conflicting data regarding the role of molecular monitoring compared with conventional assessments.
The aim of this review was to briefly summarize
current recommendations for CML disease monitoring, to discuss studies reporting molecular treatment
responses in CML patients, and to debate the prognostic value and potential limitations of molecular
monitoring using available data in patients in
chronic phase (CP).

Disease Monitoring in CML
Understanding the cellular and molecular basis of
CML has allowed the development of disease monitoring methods that detect responses to therapy and
disease recurrences at an early stage. Although treatment responses can be observed using hematologic
evaluations, the most sensitive methods for assessing CML disease status involve the cytogenetic
measurement of the frequency of Ph-positive cells
and the molecular measurement of BCR-ABL transcript levels.6,7

Cytogenetic assessment is the most widely used
method for disease monitoring in patients with CML.
Ph-positive bone marrow cells in metaphase are
quantified in a sample of 20 cells to determine cytogenetic response (CyR). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), which analyses of a higher number of
cells (up to 200), can be used instead of conventional
cytogenetic assessment for quantifying Ph positivity.7–9
However, a background level of false-positive results
limits the use of FISH and prevents full correlation
with conventional assessment. Recommendations
state that cytogenetic assessments should be performed at least every 3 to 6 months until a complete
cytogenetic response (CCyR: 0% Ph-positive cells) has
been achieved and confirmed (Table 1).6,7,10 Current
definitions of suboptimal response published by the
European LeukemiaNet include failure to achieve a
major CyR (MCyR: 35% Ph-positive cells) within 6
months of diagnosis or failure to achieve a CCyR
within 12 months.6
Once a patient has achieved a CCyR, cytogenetic
evaluation is less useful for monitoring residual disease. Because of the presence of the leukemia-specific BCR-ABL gene, CML disease status can be
monitored using real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (RT-qPCR) techniques to quantify
levels of BCR-ABL mRNA in peripheral blood.6,7,11
Molecular monitoring is often reserved for patients
who have achieved a CCyR and to our knowledge
represents the most sensitive method available for
monitoring disease status and residual disease. Some
investigators have suggested that BCR-ABL monitoring should become the method of choice for monitoring patients receiving imatinib,12 although this has
been debated.13 It is recommended that molecular
evaluation is performed every 3 months in patients
with CML.6,7,11 In a patient in stable CCyR, less frequent molecular monitoring (eg, every 6 months)

may be reasonable. A recent internet-based analysis
of treatment practice among hematologists/oncologists in the U.S. and Europe who treat patients with
CML found that 39% and 53%, respectively, perform
RT-qPCR every 3 months, with 38% and 31%, respectively, performing 6-month assessments.14
A major molecular response (MMR) has been
defined as a ratio of BCR-ABL transcripts compared
with a standardized control gene (normally ABL) of
0.1% (equivalent to a 3-log lower level),6,11 although
other slight variations are classified as MMR within
the published literature. According to LeukemiaNet
guidelines, failure to achieve a MMR within 18
months of diagnosis and treatment represents a
suboptimal treatment response.6 Achieving an undetectable or nonquantifiable level of BCR-ABL transcripts is classified as a complete molecular response
(CMR).
There is broad correlation between levels of
molecular and cytogenetic response.6,15 A BCR-ABL:
ABL ratio of 10% (1-log reduction) approximates an
MCyR and a 1% ratio (2-log reduction) approximates a
CCyR. Significant differences in median BCR-ABL
transcript levels have been demonstrated among
patients with different levels of CyR.15

Molecular Responses Achieved in CML
Targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors have produced
significant and durable treatment responses in
patients with CML, leading to a change in the natural
course of the disease. Because a MMR represents a
low level of residual disease, it could be argued that
the subset of patients achieving this response derive
the greatest clinical benefit from treatment. It should
be noted that because of methodologic differences,
molecular response rates cannot necessarily be
directly compared between studies.
Imatinib is the current first-line treatment for all
phases of CML.6,7 In the pivotal phase 3 International Randomized Study of Interferon (IFN) and
STI571 (IRIS) trial conducted in 1106 patients with
newly diagnosed CP CML, an estimated 87% of
patients who received imatinib at a dose of 400 mg/
day as initial therapy had achieved a CCyR at some
point within 5 years of follow-up.16 The MMR rate at
12 months in the total group was estimated to be
37%. High response rates have also been observed in
a single-arm study of patients with newly diagnosed
CP CML who were treated with high-dose imatinib
(800 mg/day).17 Over a median follow-up period of
15 months, 90% of 114 patients attained a CCyR,
63% attained a MMR (BCR-ABL:ABL ratio <0.05%),
and 28% achieved a CMR.

Molecular responses to imatinib have also been
reported in patients with CP CML treated after IFN
failure. In a noncomparative study from a single
center (median follow-up of 45 months; n 5 261
patients), the CCyR rate was 63%, the MMR rate
(BCR-ABL:ABL ratio <0.05%) was 31%, and the CMR
rate was 15%.18 In a study conducted by the
GIMEMA Working Party in CML of patients treated
with imatinib for 2 years (n 5 191), a CCyR was
achieved in 44% of patients, and among patients in
continuous cytogenetic disease remission, approximately half achieved a CMR.19 In a small study of
patients receiving high-dose imatinib after IFN failure (n 5 36), a CCyR was reported in 89%, with 56%
and 41% of patients achieving a MMR (BCR-ABL:ABL
ratio <0.045%) or CMR, respectively.20
To better understand why molecular responses
are achieved in some imatinib recipients but not
others, Cortes et al. performed a multivariate analysis
to identify factors predicting molecular response.21
The study group included patients with CP CML who
achieved a CCyR with imatinib administered at a
dose of 400 or 800 mg/day after IFN failure
(n 5 117) or patients with newly diagnosed disease
(n 5 163) who were followed for a median of 31
months. During this period, the MMR (BCR-ABL:ABL
ratio <0.05%) rate across the entire group was 62%,
and the CMR rate was 34%. Using multivariate analyses, only high-dose imatinib treatment (800 mg/day)
was found to be independently associated with a
higher probability of achieving a MMR at any time
(P 5 .02). In terms of achieving a CMR, only Ph-positive metaphases <90% at the onset of imatinib treatment were found to be significantly predictive
(P 5 .01), with high-dose imatinib found to be marginally significant (P 5 .08). In patients with newly
diagnosed disease, high-dose imatinib treatment was
found to be predictive of MMR (P 5 .01) or CMR
(P 5 .02) within 12 months.
Dasatinib is approved for patients with any
phase of CML who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib.7 A randomized phase 2 study was performed
comparing dasatinib treatment with high-dose imatinib (800 mg/day) in 150 patients who had failed
prior therapy with imatinib administered at a dose of
400 to 600 mg/day.22 With a median follow-up of 15
months, CCyRs were detected in 40% of the dasatinib
group compared with 16% of the patients treated
with high-dose imatinib (P 5 .004). In addition,
MMRs were detected in 16% of dasatinib recipients
compared with 4% of imatinib recipients (P 5 .038).
In a single-arm phase 2 study of dasatinib in patients
with CP CML after imatinib failure (n 5 186), the
median BCR-ABL:ABL ratio decreased from 66% at

baseline to 2.6% after 9 months.23 Preliminary data
have been presented from a study of first-line dasatinib therapy in patients with CP CML. Among 21 evaluable patients assessed after 12 months of treatment,
33% achieved a MMR (BCR-ABL:ABL ratio <0.05%)
and 5% achieved a CMR.24

Prognostic Implications of Molecular Responses
There is an increasing body of evidence indicating
that achieving a molecular response has prognostic
significance, both in terms of durability of treatment
responses and PFS. Molecular monitoring, therefore,
may be particularly useful for identifying patients at
greatest risk for disease recurrence or progression.
To our knowledge, 2 studies to date have demonstrated that early reductions in BCR-ABL transcript
levels predict the subsequent achievement of an
MCyR. Merx et al. reported that among patients
receiving imatinib after IFN failure, an early reduction in the BCR-ABL:ABL ratio to <20% of baseline at
2 months was correlated with a significantly higher
probability of MCyR at 6 months (P 5 .007).25 In a
similar study by Wang et al., decreases in the BCRABL:ABL ratio to <50% of baseline after 4 weeks or
to <10% after 3 months were associated with a significantly higher probability of achieving a MCyR at
6 months (P < .001).26
Molecular responses also are predictive of the
duration of CCyR. In a study by the Mannheim
group, mean levels of the best BCR-ABL:ABL ratio
reduction achieved were significantly lower in
patients with continuous cytogenetic disease remissions compared with those who developed disease
recurrence (P 5 .0011).27 In addition, no patient who
achieved a MMR subsequently experienced cytogenetic disease recurrence, compared with 46% of
patients who did not achieve a MMR and subsequently developed recurrence (P 5 .0036; median follow-up of 13 months). Similarly, investigators at the
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
reported that a significantly lower proportion of
patients achieving a molecular response (BCRABL:ABL ratio <0.05%; 5%) or CMR (4%) subsequently lost their CCyR compared with patients who
did not achieve a MMR (37%; P 5 .0001).21 Furthermore, patients who achieved a molecular response
within 6 months or 12 months were found to have a
significantly longer duration of CCyR compared with
those without a molecular response. A comparable
trend was reported by the GIMEMA group; patients
who received imatinib after IFN failure and who
attained a MMR at the time of first achieving a
CCyR, or patients who attained a MMR within 12
months, had a significantly longer duration of cyto-

genetic disease remission than comparator groups
(P < .05 and P 5 .021, respectively).28
Importantly, early molecular response also may
predict lack of disease progression. In the IRIS trial,
patients who had a CCyR and MMR (3-log reduction) at 12 months had a 100% probability of
remaining free from disease progression at 24
months, compared with a 95% probability in
patients who had a CCyR but no MMR (P 5 .007)
(Fig. 1).29 In the study by Wang et al., decreases in
the BCR-ABL:ABL ratio with imatinib therapy to
<50% after 4 weeks or <10% after 3 months were
associated with a superior PFS (P  .01; median follow-up of 16.5 months).26 Similarly, a recently
reported study found that rates of disease progression were significantly lower in patients who had
achieved BCR-ABL transcript ratios of <10% at 3
months (P 5 .04) or <1% at 6 months (P 5 .005).30
Achieving a 2-log molecular response at the time of
CCyR also was found to be predictive of a significantly longer duration of PFS (P 5 .005).31
In addition to predicting the duration of CyR or
PFS, BCR-ABL transcript levels may also provide an
early indication of loss of response. A 2-fold or serial
rise in BCR-ABL levels has been associated with
BCR-ABL mutation and the development of acquired
imatinib resistance (P < .0001).32,33 Among 183 patients with CP CML (median follow-up of 20 months)
with simultaneous RT-qPCR and bone marrow cytogenetic measurements, no patient experienced cytogenetic disease progression without an indication

patient in each group died.34

from molecular monitoring (20 of 24 patients had a
simultaneous or preceding BCR-ABL level increase of
at least 2-fold).15
Overall, various data indicate that achieving a
molecular response, and particularly an early molecular response, predicts the subsequent achievement
and duration of cytogenetic responses, as well as a
significantly lower likelihood of disease progression.
However, some questions still remain regarding the
use of molecular monitoring.

Potential Issues With Molecular Monitoring
Although the prognostic significance of molecular
responses in CML is widely stated, to our knowledge
no studies to date have reported an advantage of
greater overall survival associated with achieving a
molecular response, although this may reflect the duration of follow-up. One study to date has reported
that in patients with newly diagnosed CML who
achieved a CCyR with imatinib treatment, the overall
survival and PFS were similar regardless of whether a
molecular response had been achieved (Fig. 2).34 In
this study, the survival benefit for imatinib treatment
was associated with an improvement of CyR. In a
study of patients with CP or accelerated-phase CML,
cytogenetic, but not molecular, response at 3 months
was identified by multivariate analysis as the only independent parameter predictive of PFS at 2 years.13
It should also be noted that in the IRIS study 5-year
update, freedom from disease progression to advanced disease was found to be similar in patients in
cytogenetic disease remission at 18 months with or
without a molecular response (100% vs 98%; P 5
.11), but was significantly lower in patients who did

not achieve cytogenetic disease remission (87%;
P < .001).16 These data may support a hypothesis that
for some endpoints, achieving a CCyR has greater
prognostic significance than achieving a molecular
response in CML. The predictive value of achieving a
molecular response within a particular timeframe after cytogenetic disease remission also has been questioned. In the study by Press et al., once CCyR had
been achieved with imatinib treatment, the PFS benefit associated with achieving a subsequent MMR
existed regardless of when the MMR occurred.31
There are practical issues associated with measuring molecular responses. Molecular monitoring of
CML is performed in a restricted number of centers
worldwide. Techniques for BCR-ABL measurement
vary with respect to choice of control gene, quality of
RNA extract, and assay sensitivity. The apparent differences between MMR and CMR rates reported in
separate studies often reflect variability in testing
methods, making accurate comparisons impossible,
and a ‘‘negative’’ test (CMR) may simply indicate
inadequate test sensitivity.35 Precise standardization
is required before data from different laboratories
can be compared.11,36 Confusion surrounding terminology also may contribute to difficulties in reporting
and understanding molecular monitoring. The term
‘‘log reduction’’ may be erroneously interpreted to
mean that BCR-ABL levels are decreased relative to
baseline in a particular individual, rather than relative to an established control level.11 To address
some of these issues, an international scale for
molecular responses has been proposed, in which
BCR-ABL levels are reported as a percentage ratio of
a control gene that has been validated using reference standards.
A note of caution regarding molecular monitoring terminology has also been voiced. The term
‘‘complete molecular response’’ may be interpreted
as an absolute lack of leukemia, which is misleading.12 Although imatinib treatment is highly effective,
the most primitive leukemic stem cells are resistant
to imatinib and persist despite continuous treatment.37,38 Data from several reports indicate that discontinuing imatinib treatment after CMR results in
disease recurrence in approximately 50% of patients,
usually occurring rapidly after discontinuation.39–43
In summary, some questions may still remain
regarding the significance of molecular monitoring
and reporting in patients with CML.

Conclusions
The value of measuring molecular response in CML
is solidified by its usefulness as a sensitive predictor
of cytogenetic disease remission and lack of disease

progression. Whether this supersedes or adds to the
cytogenetic response assessment requires further
evaluation. Several studies have demonstrated that
early molecular responses of different levels are associated with significantly improved long-term outcomes. Rising BCR-ABL levels may provide the
earliest indication that a patient has become resistant to imatinib and/or whether BCR-ABL mutation
has occurred. Therefore, molecular monitoring enables
timely decisions to be made with regard to therapeutic strategy. Standardization of testing procedures
may make molecular monitoring more widespread,
and as experience increases, potential benefits
should become clearer. Although available evidence
clearly demonstrates that molecular monitoring has
an important role in CML, the prognostic significance of achieving a CCyR should not be forgotten.
