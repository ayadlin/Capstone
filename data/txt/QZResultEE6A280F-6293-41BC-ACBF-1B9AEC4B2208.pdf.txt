Abstract
The Ras-like GTPases RalA and B are important drivers of tumor growth and metastasis1.
Chemicals that block Ral function would be valuable as research tools and for cancer therapeutics.
Here, we used protein structure analysis and virtual screening to identify drug-like molecules that
bind a site on the GDP-form of Ral. Compounds RBC6, RBC8 and RBC10 inhibited Ral binding

to its effector RalBP1, Ral-mediated cell spreading in murine fibroblasts and anchorageindependent growth of human cancer cell lines. Binding of RBC8 derivative BQU57 to RalB was
confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasma resonance and 15N-HSQC NMR.
RBC8 and BQU57 show selectivity for Ral relative to Ras or Rho and inhibit xenograft tumor
growth similar to depletion of Ral by siRNA. Our results show the utility of structure-based
discovery for development of therapeutics for Ral-dependent cancers.

More than one-third of human tumors harbor activating RAS mutations2, which has
motivated extensive efforts to develop inhibitors of Ras for cancer therapy. However,
therapies directed at interfering with Ras post-translational modifications3 gave poor clinical
performance and efforts shifted to target signaling components downstream of Ras such as
Raf-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases4 and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKTmTOR pathway5. A third pathway downstream of Ras that leads to activation of the Raslike small GTPases, RalA and RalB6, has not been targeted to date. Active Ral activates
cellular processes through effectors including Ral Binding Protein 1 (RalBP1, RLIP76 or
RIP17), Sec5/Exo85, filamin, and phospholipase D18–10. These effectors mediate regulation
of cell adhesion (anchorage independence), membrane trafficking (exocytosis, endocytosis),
mitochondrial fission and transcription. RalA and RalB are important drivers of the
proliferation, survival and metastasis of multiple human cancers including skin11, lung12,
pancreatic1, colon13, prostate14, and bladder15,16.

We set out to discover small molecules that inhibit the intracellular actions of Ral GTPases.
Our approach was based on the hypothesis that molecules that selectively bind to Ral-GDP
might restrict Ral in an inactive state in the cell, making it unavailable to promote processes
linked to tumorigenesis. Comparing available three-dimensional structures of RalA revealed
differences in a region adjacent to, but distinct from, the guanine nucleotide binding pocket
(Fig. 1). This site is formed by the switch-II region (Ral70-Ral77), helix α2 (Ral78-Ral85) and
one face of helix α3 (Fig. 1a). Its proximity to the previously described C3bot binding site17
supports the notion that small molecule occupancy at this site could inhibit function. The
crystal structures used in the comparison included RalA-GDP (PDB code 2BOV, Fig. 1a, b)
and RalA-GNP (non-hydrolysable form of GTP) in complex with exo84 (PDB code 1ZC4,
Fig. 1c) or sec5 (PDB code 1UAD, Fig. 1d). Volumes calculated for this binding site were
175 Å3 for RalA-GDP (Fig. 1b), 155 Å3 for RalA-GNP-exo84 (Fig. 1c), and 116 Å3 for
RalA-GNP-sec5 (Fig. 1d). To our knowledge, a RalB-GDP crystal structure is not available.
However, in the RalB-GNP structure (PDB code 2KE5, Extended Data Fig. 1) this binding
site is largely absent. Next, we used a structure-based virtual screening approach18 to
identify small molecules that bind to this site in RalA-GDP by individually docking 500,000
compounds to this site (ChemDiv, v2006.5)19 and scoring protein-ligand complexes based
on calculated interaction energies. This process led to selection of 88 compounds.
We developed an ELISA for assay of Ral activity in living cells based on selective binding
of active RalA-GTP to its effector protein RalBP1. This assay used J82 human bladder
cancer cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged RalA. The epitope tag greatly increased the
sensitivity and dynamic range of the assay compared to using Ral antibodies for detection
(Extended Data Fig. 2a). Cells were treated with each of the 88 compounds (tested at 50

μM), extracts prepared, and FLAG-RalA binding to recombinant RalBP1 immobilized in 96
well plates was quantified. In this assay, the RalA binding reflects its GTP-loading and
capacity for effector activation. Compounds RBC6, RBC8, and RBC10 (structures shown in
Fig. 1e–g) reduced the activation of RalA in living cells (Fig. 1h) while compounds RBC5,
RBC7, and RBC42 (structures not shown) had no effect and thus served as negative
controls. None of the 88 compounds inhibited GTP or GDP binding to purified recombinant
RalA (Supplementary Information), consistent with the interaction site being distinct from
that used for binding guanine nucleotides.

A second cell-based assay also assessed the effects of compounds. Ral is required for lipid
raft exocytosis and spreading of murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) on fibronectin-coated
coverslips20. In these cells, depletion of RalA by siRNA inhibits spreading of WT MEFs,
whereas caveolin deficient (Cav1−/−) MEFs are resistant to RalA depletion. When RBC6,
RBC8 and RBC10 were tested for effects on cell spreading in WT and Cav1−/− MEFs,
inhibition was observed only in the WT MEFs (Fig. 1i, Extended Data Fig. 2b). RBC6 and
RBC8 are related structures sharing the same bicyclic core (Fig. 1e, f), with specific
substitutions giving rise to similar but somewhat different binding orientations in the
allosteric binding cavity (Extended Data Fig. 2c–e). We therefore focused on the RBC6/8
for further studies.

To test for direct binding of compounds to Ral, we used TROSY (Transverse RelaxationOptimized Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) 15N-HSQC NMR. The NMR
structure of RalB in complex with the GTP analogue GMP-PNP (GNP) has been solved
(PDB code 2KE5, BMRB entry 15230)21, therefore we focused on this isoform. First, we
obtained complete backbone NMR chemical shift assignments for the RalB-GDP complex
(see methods) and then compared the 15N-HSQC NMR spectrum of RalB-GDP and RalBGNP to determine chemical shift differences between the Ral GTP vs. GDP bound states.
Almost all the differences were confined to residues that interact with the third phosphate of
the GTP (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). 1H-15N-HSQC spectra were then recorded in the
presence of the compound RBC8 or DMSO as a control and chemical shift changes
compared. RBC8 induced chemical shift changes in RalB-GDP but not RalB-GNP,
indicating that RBC8 shows selectivity for the GDP bound form of Ral (Extended Data Fig.
3c, d). Moreover, RBC5, which did not affect the level of active Ral in the cell-based ELISA
assay, also did not induce chemical shift changes in RalB-GDP (Extended Data Fig. 3e),
therefore serving as additional negative control. Based on all data including structural
features, a series of RBC8 derivatives was synthesized and tested for binding in vitro. We
chose BQU57 for further evaluation because of its superior performance compared to RBC8
and its drug-like properties (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 4a, synthesis pathway in
Supplementary Information). A detailed NMR analysis of the binding between BQU57 and
RalB-GDP was carried out. The NMR spectrum of RalB-GDP (100 μM) in the absence
(black) and presence (magenta) of 100 μM BQU57 is shown in Fig. 2b. Concentrationdependent chemical shift changes for representative residues are shown in Fig. 2c. A plot of
the chemical shift changes with 100 μM BQU57 as a function of sequence (Fig. 2d) shows
that residues that exhibit significant changes (highlighted bars) are located in the switch-II
(aa 70–77) and helix α2 (aa 78–85) region. Because no RalB-GDP crystal structure is

available, instead a homology model was generated based on the similarity to RalA-GDP,
and the residues that displayed chemical shift changes in response to the compounds were
mapped onto this model (Fig. 2e). The majority of the chemical shift changes localized to
the allosteric site, consistent with assignment of BQU57 binding to this site based on
modeling. Similar to results with RBC8, BQU57 (100 μM) did not bind to RalB-GNP (100
μM) as indicated by minimal chemical shift changes on NMR spectrum (Extended Data Fig.
4b). Analysis of the NMR chemical shift titrations revealed that binding of BQU57 was
stoichiometric up to the apparent limiting solubility of the drug (estimated as ~100 μM in
control experiments without protein)(Extended Data Fig. 4c). The binding of BQU57 to
RalB-GDP also was determined using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) which yielded
a KD = 7.7 ± 0.6 μM (Fig. 2f). This was similar to results from Surface Plasma Resonance
(SPR) which gave a KD of 4.7 ± 1.5 μM (Extended Data Fig. 4d).

Next we evaluated RBC8, BQU57, and RBC5 (as a negative control) on human lung cancer
lines, H2122, H358, H460 and Calu6. Ral promotes anchorage-independence1,20, therefore
we measured cell growth in soft agar. We examined drug uptake, and found that RBC8,
BQU57 and RBC5 were readily taken into cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). In addition, we
found that all four lines were sensitive to K-Ras siRNA depletion (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b)
but only H2122 and H358 were sensitive to Ral knockdown (Extended Data Fig. 6c, d). We
used this characteristic to assess the specificity of the compounds for inhibiting Ral. Colony
formation in soft agar showed that the Ral-dependent lines H2122 and H358, but not H460
or Calu6, were sensitive to RBC8 and BQU57 treatment (Fig. 3a, b). The IC50 for RBC8 is
3.5 μM in H2122 and 3.4 μM in H358; for BQU57 2.0 μM in H2122 and 1.3 μM in H358.
The inactive control compound RBC5 did not inhibit growth of any of these cell lines
(Extended Data Fig. 5d). Additionally, a Ral pull-down assay using RalBP1 agarose beads8
showed that RBC8 and BQU57 but not RBC5 inhibited both RalA and RalB activation in
both the H2122 and H358 cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 5e).
To further examine the specificity of the compounds for Ral, Ral A and B were knocked
down in H2122 and H358 cells with siRNA. RBC8 or BQU57 treatment showed no further
inhibition of colony formation after Ral knockdown (Fig. 3c–f, Extended Data Fig. 6e). This
supports the conclusion that inhibition of cell growth by these compounds depends on Ral
proteins. Lastly, overexpression of a constitutively active (GTP-form22) RalAG23V or
RalBG23V, which do not bind these compounds (Extended Data Fig. 3d, 4b), mitigated
inhibition of H2122 and H358 cell growth by these compounds (Fig. 3g–j, Extended Data
Fig. 6f). Together, these data provide evidence that RBC8 and BQU57 act specifically
through the GDP-bound form of Ral proteins.

Inhibition of Ral activity and tumor growth were evaluated in human lung cancer mouse
xenograft models. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of RBC8 and BQU57 were analyzed in mice.
Serum concentrations were determined using LC-MS/MS methods after intraperitoneal
injection. RBC8 and BQU57 showed favorable properties that define good drug candidates
(Extended Data Fig. 7a). We then determined compound entry into tumor tissue 3h after
dosing. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 7b–c, the compounds were detected in tumor tissue
in vivo. To test the effect of Ral inhibitors on xenograft tumor growth, nude mice were
inoculated subcutaneously with H2122 human lung cancer cells and treated intraperitoneally

with 50 mg/kg/d of RBC8 for 21 days (except weekends). RBC8 inhibited tumor growth
(Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 7d) to a similar extent as dual knockdown of RalA and RalB
(Fig. 4b). A second lung cancer line, H358 yielded similar results (Extended Data Fig. 7e).
BQU57 was tested in vivo at several different doses 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg/d and dosedependent growth inhibition effects were observed (Fig. 4c).
Lastly, to further evaluate specificity for Ral GTPases, H2122 xenograft tumors (median
size 250 mm3) were collected 3h after a single intraperitoneal injection of RBC5 (50 mg/kg),
RBC8 (50 mg/kg) or BQU57 (10/20/50 mg/kg) and activation of Ral in the extracts was
analyzed in RalBP1 pull-down assays. Both RalA and RalB were significantly inhibited by
RBC8 (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d) and BQU57 (Fig. 4e) but not by the inactive compound
RBC5 (Extended Data Fig. 8e, f). By contrast, no inhibition of Ras and RhoA activity was
observed (Fig. 4e).

One reason for the failures to date to obtain clinically useful inhibitors for Ras and other
related GTPases is the highly conserved guanine nucleotide binding site that has high
affinity for the guanine nucleotides GDP/GTP present at millimolar concentrations in cells,
and would out-compete ligands for this site. Similar considerations delayed development of
protein kinase inhibitors, and indeed some of the best kinase inhibitors proved to not be
competitive with ATP, but are allosteric inhibitors that lock the conformation of kinases
such as MEK in a closed state23. Recently, three studies used similar fragment-based small
molecule screening to identify compounds that bind sites on the K-Ras surface and block its
SOS-mediated activation24–26 suggesting the approach has some promise.

Although our initial library screening was based on RalA structure, the selected compounds
also bound RalB, which is not surprising given the similarity of the amino acid sequences
and predicted structures. Molecular docking could not be performed on RalB-GDP since
only the RalB-GNP structure is available. However, NMR experiments with RalB-GDP
demonstrated interactions within the allosteric site. Moreover, the selected compounds
inhibited the activity of both RalA and RalB in cell culture and in human tumor xenografts.
Although distinct roles of RalA and RalB in tumorigenesis and metastasis has been
proposed 1,8,12,13, genetically engineered mouse models revealed substantial redundancy for
Ral proteins in tumorigenesis12. These results support the clinical utility of compounds that
inhibit both GTPases. Though additional medicinal chemistry optimization is required, these
Ral inhibitors represent a first generation of valuable tools for elucidating Ral signaling and
developing novel agents for cancer therapy.

J82 cells stably overexpressing FLAG-RalA were plated 800,000 cells per well in 6-well
plates and allowed to incubate for 16 h. Cells were treated with 500 μl of fresh medium
containing test compounds (50 μM) or DMSO control (1.0 h; 37°C). Cells were then washed
with ice-cold PBS and collected into ice-cold lysis buffer (750 μl containing 50 mM Tris,
pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal ca-630, 10 mM MgCl2, and protease inhibitors). The
lysate was cleared by centrifugation and the supernatants were then flash-frozen and stored
at −80°C until testing. For the ELISA assay, HisGrab nickel coated 96-well plate strips
(Pierce, #15142) were washed three times with ELISA buffer (200 μl consisting of 50 mM
Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, and 10 mM MgCl2). RalBP1 (0.5 μg/100 μl)
was then added to the wells and incubated with rocking (2.0 h RT). The plates were then
washed three times with 200 μl ELISA buffer. The plates were placed on ice and lysates, or
lysis buffer control (100 μl), were added to the wells in quadruplicate. The plates were then
incubated overnight with rocking at 4°C followed by two washes with ice-cold ELISA
buffer. Mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma, F1804) antibody (1:20,000 in ELISA buffer) was then
added at 100 μl per well and incubated (1.0 h, 4°C). After three washes, goat anti-mouse
antibody conjugated to HRP (Pierce, #31430) (1:2,500) was added at 100 μl per well and
incubated (1.0 h, 4°C). HRP substrate (Vector Laboratories, #SK-4400) was added to each
well at 100 μl after three washes and incubated for 1.0 h at RT. The reactions were stopped
by adding sulfuric acid (100 μl, 2N). Absorbance was read at OD450 on a Biotek Synergy
H1 plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT); Absorbance was corrected for
background absorbance by subtracting the reading for the same well at OD540.

After treatment, cells were rinsed once with DMEM containing 0.2% serum and equal
numbers of cells from all treatments were added to 24-well plates that had been coated
overnight (4°C, 2.0 μg/mL human fibronectin). Cells were allowed to spread for 30 min and
then fixed with formaldehyde using standard protocols. To enable visualization, cells were
labeled with Lava Cell (Active Motif) and visualized on a Nikon TE300 fluorescence

RalB (Q72L mutant) in a pET16b (Novagen) plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Darerca
Owen (Cambridge University). RalB was purified as previously described21, with additional
steps for loading with GDP or the non-hydrolyzable form of GTP, GMPNPP (GNP, SigmaAldrich) which was done as previously described30. Uniform 13C15N-double labeled protein
was produced in M9 media supplemented with 15N-NH4Cl and 13C-glucose. Samples were
prepared for NMR in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl and 1.0 mM MgCl2.
All NMR experiments were recorded on an Agilent 900 MHz system at 25 °C. Resonance
assignments for the RalB-GNP complex were obtained from previously published studies
deposited in Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB, code: 15230). Chemical shift
assignments of the RalB-GDP complex were obtained independently using HNCACB,
CBCA(CO)NH and COCNH-TOCSY experiments. All NMR data was processed using
NMRPipe31 and analyzed using CCPNMR analysis program32. Assignment were obtained
by automated assignment using PINE33 followed by manual verification. 15N-HSQC
experiments were used to monitor amide shifts from the RalB protein (100 μM) following
the addition of compound reconstituted in deuterated DMSO. DMSO concentrations in the
final sample were 0.5% or 1%; control samples were made with 0.5% or 1% deuterated
DMSO and all samples containing compounds were compared to their corresponding
DMSO control. Normalized chemical shift changes were calculated according to the
equation Δδ = sqrt (ΔδH2 + 0.15*ΔδN2).
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and Surface Plasma Resonance (SPR)

ITC experiments were carried out using the MicroCal iTC200 system. RalB protein was
purified as described above. Both protein and drug were prepared in 50 mM sodium
phosphate, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, and 1.0 mM MgCl2. Final DMSO concentration was
adjusted to 1%. RalB-GDP protein (300 μM) were loaded into the syringe and titrated into
drug (25 μM) or buffer alone as control. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. SPR
experiments were carried out using the Biacore 3000 system. RalB protein purified as above.
Running buffer contained PBS, pH 7.4, 1.0 μM GDP, 2.0 mM MgCl2, and 3% DMSO.
Regeneration buffer contained PBS, pH 7.4, 1.0 μM GDP, and 2.0 mM MgCl2. RalB-GDP
protein was immobilized onto CM5 chip; samples of compound BQU57 in running buffer
were injected at 30 μL/min for 60 s contact time followed by 5.0 minute regeneration.

His-RalA (100 ng) was incubated with gamma-labeled 32P-GTP (8 nM assay concentration)
and either DMSO or individual compounds (50 μM assay concentration) dissolved in
DMSO in the presence of EDTA (20 mM) for 15 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by
dilution into excess MgCl2, and the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotide was measured
by filter binding34. 32P-GTP (alpha-labeled) was converted to 32P-GDP by nucleotide
diphosphokinase, and used for the binding assay with GDP.
In vitro growth of human cancer cells

Author Manuscript

Growth inhibition on human lung cancer cells by the compounds were measured under
anchorage-independent conditions in soft agar. Cells were seeded into 6-well plates (coated
with a base layer made of 2.0 ml of 1% low-melting-point agarose) at 15,000 cells per well
in 3.0 ml of 0.4% low-melting-point agarose containing various concentration of drug. Two
to four weeks (depending on cell line) after incubation, cells were stained with 1.0 mg/ml
Nitro Blue Tetrazolium and colonies were counted under a microscope. The IC50 values
were defined as the concentration of drug that resulted in 50% reduction in colony number
compared to DMSO treated control. For growth effects induced by siRNA treatment, cells
were transfected with 50 nM siRNA against RalA, RalB or both (RalA/B) using methods
and sequences described8. After 48 hr, cells were subjected to the soft agar colony formation
assay as describe above. For the chemo-genetic experiments, siRNA treated cells were
seeded into soft agar in the presence of various concentrations of drug. For the
overexpression experiments, H358 cells stably overexpressing FLAG, FLAG-RalAG23V or
FLAG-RalBG23V were generated and cells were subjected to the soft agar colony formation
assay in the presence of drug. Attempts to stably overexpress FLAG-RalAG23V or FLAGRalBG23V in H2122 cells were unsuccessful and the rescue experiments with H2122 were
carried out 48 hr after transient transfection with FLAG, FLAG-RalAG23V or FLAGRalBG23V using agar colony formation assay in the presence of drug.
Cellular uptake, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics studies

Author Manuscript

To quantitate how well the compounds get into cells, H2122 human lung cancer cells were
seeded at 3 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates and let sit for 16 h. Compounds (10 μM)
were individually dosed in triplicate; cells were then collected into 800 μl ice-cold
ACN:MeOH:H20 (1:1:1) at different time points (1, 5, 15, 30 and 60 min). Drug
concentrations in cell lysates were then determined using LC/MS-MS methods described
below. The pharmacokinetics of RBC8 and BQU57 were determined in nude mice following
a single i.p. dose (50 mg/Kg). Blood samples were collected into EDTA-coated tubes at time
intervals from 15 min to 5 h post-dose (9 time points) and centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15
minutes to generate plasma samples. Pharmacokinetic parameters including area under the
curve (AUC), Co, and t½ were estimated using non-compartmental methods. The
pharmacodynamics of compounds were determined in tumor-bearing nude mice following a
single dose of 50 mg/Kg given i.p. Tissue samples were collected 3.0 h after injection of
RBC8 or BUQ57. Tissue samples were then homogenized with two weight volumes of
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). HPLC-MS/MS methods to quantify RBC8 and BQU57 in plasma
and tissues were developed. Plasma or homogenized tissue samples were extracted with

analyzed using a Shimadzu HPLC (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc.; Columbia, MD)
equipped with a Zorbax extended-C18 50 × 4.6 mm, 5 micron column (Agilent

All experiments were approved by the University of Colorado Denver Animal Care and Use
Committee and were carried out according to approved protocols. Female athymic nude
mice (Ncr nu/nu; National Cancer Institute, Fredrick, MD) were received at 5 to 6 weeks of
age and were allowed to acclimate for 2 weeks in sterile micro isolator cages with constant
temperature and humidity. Mice had free access to food and water. Mice were randomized
into 6 per group immediately before use (no blinding was done). H2122 cells in log-phase
growth were harvested on the day of use. Cells were suspended in un-supplemented RPMI
1640 medium and 0.1 mL (2 × 105 cells) was injected s.c. four sites per mice. For H358
xenografts, cells (5 × 106) were mixed with matrigel (20% final concentration) and 0.1 mL
was inoculated s.c. per site. After cell inoculation, mice were monitored daily, weighed
twice weekly and caliper measurements begun when tumors visible. Tumor volume was
calculated by (L × W2) / 2, where L is longer measurement of tumor and W is the smaller
tumor measurement. Drug treatment started the day after inoculation. Compounds were
dissolved in DMSO and injected i.p. daily except weekends at 10/20/50 mg/kg. No obvious
toxicities were observed in the control (DMSO) or drug-treated animals as assessed by
difference in body weight between control and drug-treated animals taking tumor size into
account.
Ral activity in tumor xenografts

Author Manuscript

Nude mice were inoculated with 5 × 106 cells H2122 cells s.c. When tumor reached an
average of 250 mm3, mice were randomized into 6 per group (no blinding was done) and
were given an i.p. dose of RBC8 or BQU57 at various concentrations. Tumors were then
collected 3h after injection of RBC8 or BQU57. RalA and RalB activity in tumor samples
were then measured using the RalBP1 pull-down assay kit (Millipore #14–415) as we have
described8,15. Ras and RhoA activity in tumor samples were measured using the respective
pull-down assay kits (Cytoskeleton #BK008 and #BK036). All the activity assays used
western blotting as the final readout. For quantification of the immunoblot, bands on each
blot were first normalized to respective internal control (10 ng of recombinant Ral, Ras, or
Ral protein run in the last lane), the numbers were then compared across different blots each
of which represented one treatment condition.
