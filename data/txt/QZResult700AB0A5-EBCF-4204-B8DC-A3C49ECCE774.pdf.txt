Abstract
Women with metabolic disorders, including obesity and diabetes, have an increased risk of developing
endometrial cancer. However, the metabolism of endometrial tumors themselves has been largely understudied.
Comparing human endometrial tumors and cells with their nonmalignant counterparts, we found that
upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT6 was more closely associated with the cancer phenotype than
other hallmark cancer genes, including hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M2. Importantly, suppression of
GLUT6 expression inhibited glycolysis and survival of endometrial cancer cells. Glycolysis and lipogenesis
were also highly coupled with the cancer phenotype in patient samples and cells. To test whether targeting
endometrial cancer metabolism could be exploited as a therapeutic strategy, we screened a panel of compounds
known to target diverse metabolic pathways in endometrial cells. We identiﬁed that the glycolytic inhibitor,
3-bromopyruvate, is a powerful antagonist of lipogenesis through pyruvylation of CoA. We also provide evidence
that 3-bromopyruvate promotes cell death via a necrotic mechanism that does not involve reactive oxygen species
and that 3-bromopyruvate impaired the growth of endometrial cancer xenografts Cancer Res; 74(20); 5832–45.

Introduction
Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the developed world and affects more than 287,000
women and attributes to 74,000 deaths worldwide each year
(1). Endometrial tumors originate from epithelial cells of the
uterus and may locally progress to invade the myometrium and
further metastasize to lymph nodes, liver, and lungs in
advanced stages (2). Endometrial cancer most commonly
arises in postmenopausal women and is classically categorized
in two clinicopathologic subtypes: type I (endometrioid) and
type II (predominantly clear cell and papillary serous). Type II

tumors are generally more invasive, estrogen receptor and
progesterone receptor (ER/PR) negative, and confer a poor
prognosis but account for less than 15% of all cases (3, 4). In
contrast, the more common type I tumors are frequently lowgrade, noninvasive, ER/PR-positive, and survival rates are
higher due to early identiﬁcation and treatment with primary
surgery (4).
Obesity [body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2] is associated
with increased incidence, risk of death, and lower age of
diagnosis for endometrial cancer (5–7). Disorders associated
with hyperglycemia (type 1 and 2 diabetes) also have increased
risk of endometrial cancer, indicating that poor control of
blood glucose may be an important contributor to the growth
of these tumors in women (8, 9). In our previous study
comparing obese women with and without type I endometrial
cancer, circulating glucose levels were higher in women with
cancer (119.5 vs. 90.7 mg/dL for noncancer; P ¼ 0.049). However, other cancer-related parameters including estrogen and
insulin were not signiﬁcantly elevated in obese women with
cancer (10). These ﬁndings suggested that, independent of
adiposity and its associated hormonal changes, increased
blood glucose levels may play an important role in the growth
and/or development of type I endometrial cancer.
Endometrial cancers are well-studied at the genetic level,
but few studies have rigorously evaluated endometrial cancer
metabolism. Many of the genetic aberrations that are thought
to drive endometrial cancer initiation and progression also
regulate cell metabolism. For example, the PI3K/protein kinase
B (Akt) pathway is altered in up to 93% of type I endometrial
tumors, through loss of PTEN and mutations in PI3K family
members (4, 11). Other aberrations include mutations in V-Ki-

Targeting Glucose Metabolism in Endometrial Cancer

ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor, loss of liver kinase B1
(LKB1), and tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2; refs. 4, 12, 13). Despite
this information, it remains unclear whether the ﬂux of nutrients through metabolic pathways contributes to endometrial
cancer cell survival and tumor growth. Herein, we show that
glycolytic–lipogenic metabolism is increased in endometrial
cancer cells and that they are dependent upon this metabolism
for survival.

Materials and Methods
Patient sample analyses
Institutional review board approval, in accordance with
Federal regulations, was obtained from the University of
Virginia Health System (Charlottesville, VA). Endometrial
samples were collected at surgery (hysterectomy) from four
women with and four women without type I endometrial
cancer (mean age, 52.6 years; BMI, 44.5 kg/m2) and RNA was
analyzed, as described (14). For protein expression analyses,
nontumor and tumor endometrial tissue (matched for each
patient) were obtained from an independent cohort of
postmenopausal women (mean BMI, 35.3 kg/m2), with Federation Internationale des Gynaecologistes et Obstetristes
(FIGO)-deﬁned low-stage (1A–1C) and grade (1–2) type I
endometrial cancer. Analyses of gene alterations (shown
in Table 1) from endometrial and ovarian cancers were
performed using cBioPortal (15, 16) and are based solely
upon data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Research Network (11, 17, 18).
Endometrial cells
Cells were obtained from ATCC (HEC-1-A, AN3CA, KLE,
RL95-2); Sigma Aldrich (Ishikawa); Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (MFE-296, MFE-319);

Dr. Hui Li at the University of Virginia (MAD11) and Dr. Kelle
Moley at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,
MO (hUE-Ts). MAD11 and hUE-Ts are human telomerase
reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-immortalized endometrial stromal and uterine epithelial cells, respectively, which were both
derived from patients without cancer. Cancer cells have not
been validated since purchase.
Immunohistochemistry
Pathologic analyses of tumor and nontumor tissue were
performed by a certiﬁed gynecologic oncology pathologist in
a blinded manner. Immunohistochemistry was performed at
the University of Virginia Biorepository and Tissue Research
Facility using a mouse monoclonal antibody against human
GLUT6 (Abcam). 3,30 -Diaminobenzidine was used as a substrate for the peroxidase reaction and hematoxylin as the
counterstain. Slides were scanned using an Aperio ScanScope
XT Slide Scanner (Aperio) and images analyzed using the
ImageScope software (Aperio).
siRNA transfections
Cells were double transfected (24 hours apart) with 50
nmol/L ON-TARGETplus siRNA; SLC2A6 (GLUT6) SMARTpool (Pool), GLUT6 individual siRNA sequences found in
the SMARTpool (Seq.1-4), or equivalent concentrations of
nontargeting SMARTpool control (Ctrl) siRNA (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc) using JetPRIME reagent (Polyplus Transfection Inc.) as the delivery vehicle.
qPCR
RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies)
and reverse transcribed using a High Capacity cDNA kit (Life
Technologies). qPCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green
SuperMix (Bio-Rad) on an iCycler (MyiQ Optical Module)

Bio-Rad system. GLUT mRNA expression was normalized to
b2M using the Pffaﬂ method (19).

Inc.). Fluorescent signal was measured 5 minutes later at 379/
513 nm.

Western blotting
Protein lysates (20mg) were resolved by PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Protein expression
was detected with rabbit antibodies such as GAPDH, PKM2,
LDHA, ACLY, ACC, FASN, PTEN, AKT, PPARg, TSC2, G6PD
(Cell Signaling Technology); GLUT1 (Abcam); and mouse
antibodies such as pAKT (S473), P-p70S6 kinase (T389) (Cell
Signaling Technology); HK2, MCT1, 14-3-3 (Santa Cruz);
GLUT6 (Abcam); and b-actin (Sigma Aldrich). Primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse IgG (DyLight 800
conjugate) or anti-rabbit IgG (DyLight 680 conjugate) and
membranes scanned on the LI-COR ODYSSEY System (LICOR).

Cytotoxicity assays
Cells were exposed to drugs for 48 to 72 hours, and viability
was detected by addition of thiazoyl blue tetrazolium bromide
(MTT) reagent. Formazan crystals were solubilized and absorbance read at 590/620 nm. Cell viability is displayed as a
percentage of control cells, that is, cells with equivalent concentrations of the appropriate drug vehicle. Refer to Supplementary Material for detailed methods.

Metabolic assays
Cells were incubated in Krebs Ringer Phosphate (KRP)
nutrient buffer containing either D-[3-3H] glucose, D-[14C
(U)] glucose, L[14C(U)]-glutamic acid, [1-14C]-palmitic acid, or
[2-14C] acetic acid sodium salt. Substrate oxidation was measured capturing evolved 14CO2 and de novo lipogenesis (DNL)
from substrates was measured by hexane:isopropanol (3:2)
extraction of 14C-lipids. For glycolysis measurements, D-[3-3H]
glucose was separated from tritiated [3H]2O by diffusion.
Detailed methods for these assays are provided in Supplementary Material. For OCR and ECAR measurements, cells (10,000
to 20,000/well) were seeded in 24-well Seahorse tissue culture
plates a day before incubation in KRP nutrient buffer (37 C for
>30 minutes). Basal OCR (pmolesO2/min) and ECAR (mpH/
min) were measured using the Seahorse XF-24 Flux Analyzer
(Seahorse Biosciences). OCR and ECAR rates for each cell line
were averaged over 3 plates and normalized to protein content
per well.
Lactate release
Lactate standards, NADþ, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
were prepared in glycine–hydrazine buffer (500 mmol/L glycine, 127 mmol/L hydrazine sulfate, pH 9.5). Cells were incubated in DMEM (without phenol red or FBS) for 45 minutes.
Media removed from cells was incubated with 2.5 mmol/L
NADþ and 25 mg/mL LDH for 1 hour at room temperature and
absorbance measured at 340 nm.
Glucose uptake
Cells were incubated with 5 mmol/L 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) in KRP with 0.2 mCi of 3H-2-DG per well for 2.5 minutes.
Cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS before permeabilization
in 1% TritonX-100 (1 hour) before counting.
Analyses of free thiol groups
CoA and 3-bromopyruvate (BrPA) were prepared in PBS (pH
7.4), and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in water, and coincubated at
room temperature (15 minutes). CoA and NAC alone were used
as positive controls, and BrPA alone as a negative control.
Solutions were added to black-walled 96-well plates with an
equivalent volume of 10 mmol/L ThioGlo1 (Covalent Associates

Cell viability and cycle analyses
Cells were stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; 2
mg/mL) and Annexin V (AV). Viable (AV) and nonviable
(AVþ) cell populations were determined by ﬂow cytometry
(BD FACSCanto I). For cell cycle, cells were permeabilized/
stained with 0.4% Triton X-100, 2 mg/mL RNase, and 2 mmol/L
TOPRO-3 in warm PBS. Proﬁles were determined by ﬂow
cytometry and sub-G1 populations gated using FlowJo software
(Tree Star Inc.).
Cell death assays
LDH release (LDH-Cytotoxicity Assay Kit II, Abcam) and
caspase activity (Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay reagent, Promega)
were measured by luminescence, as per manufacturer's
instructions. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose gel
electrophoresis, as previously described (20).
Mass spectrometry
Cell samples (in ice-cold 6% perchloric acid) contained 13C3malonyl-CoA (0.5 mmol/L ﬁnal) as an internal standard. Supernatants were loaded onto pre-equilibrated solid-phase extraction columns (Oasis HLB, 1 cc/30 mg, Waters) and dried
eluates reconstituted in chromatography solvent. Analyses
were performed using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
(AB-Sciex 4000 Q-Trap) coupled to a Shimadzu LC-20AD LC
system equipped with a Supelco Discovery C18 column (50 mm
 2.1 mm  5 mm bead size).
Animal studies
Six-week-old female athymic nude mice (Crl:NU(NCr)Foxn1nu, Charles River Laboratories Inc.) were subcutaneously
inoculated with 3  105 296 cells. Mice with palpable tumors
(2 mm diameter) were administered 2.5 mg/kg freshly prepared BrPA (pH 7.5) or equivalent volumes of PBS (vehicle) by
intraperitoneal injection 4 days a week for 3 weeks. Mice were
killed (CO2 asphyxiation) when the largest tumor neared 1 cm3.
Tumor volumes (length  width2/2) were calculated each week
during treatment and at time of harvest. All animal experiments were approved by the University of Virginia Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Statistical analysis
Unpaired 2-tailed Student t tests were used to determine the
statistical differences between experimental and control
groups where appropriate with P < 0.05 considered statistically

Targeting Glucose Metabolism in Endometrial Cancer

and linear regression graphs were derived from the GraphPad
Prism program.

Results
Glucose transporters, and glycolytic and lipogenic
enzymes, are upregulated in the malignant
endometrium
We previously reported gene expression data from women
with type I endometrial cancer who were matched for age
(mean, 52.6 years) and BMI (mean, 44.5 kg/m2; ref. 14). Mining
the microarray data using gene set enrichment analysis identiﬁed the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis gene set as highly
enriched in tumor-derived endometrium (NES, 1.87; q ¼ 0.02;
P < 0.001; Fig. 1A). Among the most elevated genes in malignant
tissue were the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase 2 (HK2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate
kinase M2 (PKM2), and lactate dehydrogenase isoform A
(LDHA; Fig. 1A). We also performed bioinformatics analyses
on genes that were upregulated by more than 6-fold (371 genes)
using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID; refs. 21, 22) and matched these hits to the
Panther biologic processes gene lists. These data identiﬁed
that glycolytic and lipogenic metabolic pathways were
enriched in malignant compared with nonmalignant endometrium (Fig. 1B). In an independent cohort of six patients with
type I endometrial cancer, we validated the gene expression
data at the protein level. Figure 1C shows the expression of
glycolytic (HK2, PKM2, GAPDH, and LDHA) and DNL enzymes,
including ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl-CoA carboxylases
(ACC1 and ACC2), and fatty acid synthase (FASN). All of these
enzymes except GAPDH were elevated in the majority of tumor
versus adjacent nonmalignant tissue (Supplementary Fig.
S1A).
Aberrations in the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway are common in
type I endometrial cancer. In our samples, PTEN expression
was reduced in one tumor sample, but activation of Akt
(phosphorylation at Ser473) was evident in most tumor samples (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1A). In contrast, the
expression of PPARg, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD), TSC2, and phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal kinase
(pS6K) were not dramatically altered between tumor and
nontumor endometrial tissue (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Although alterations in LKB1 expression were observed in
some tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1B), these changes were
inconsistent between patient samples, that is, LKB1 expression
was higher in one tumor and lower in other tumors, compared
with adjacent nontumor tissue. Overall, these data indicate
that Akt activation is associated with increased expression of
glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes in endometrial tumor tissue
(Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Glucose is a primary carbon source for glycolysis and
lipogenesis and enters cells through glucose transporters. We
manually ranked the GLUT family of transporters and identiﬁed GLUT6 (SLC2A6) as the 11th most upregulated gene overall
and the most signiﬁcantly elevated GLUT in the malignant
endometrium (36.9-fold increase; Fig. 1E). Elevated GLUT6
protein expression was conﬁrmed in tumor tissue compared

www.aacrjournals.org

with matched nontumor endometrium in ﬁve of the six
patients (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S1A). GLUT6 is highly
expressed in cancerous glandular epithelial cells, particularly
those closest to blood vessels in the surrounding stroma (Fig.
1G and Supplementary Fig. S2). Blood vessels also stained
positive for GLUT6. Glandular cells from the normal human
endometrium had little or no expression of GLUT6 (Fig. 1G and
Supplementary Fig. S2). In comparison, the ubiquitously
expressed glucose transporter, GLUT1, was elevated by 4.3fold at the gene level in the malignant endometrium (Fig. 1E)
and in three of six tumors compared with nontumor endometrium (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Analyses of TCGA datasets found that 40% of type I and
68% of type II endometrial cancers harbor alterations in the
glycolytic–lipogenic gene set found in our cohort of patient
samples (Table 1). The percentage of cases with alterations
did not vary dramatically between women with stage I
versus more advanced stages or lean versus obese within
type I and within type II cancers (Table 1). However, patients
with type I cancers (all cases) containing alterations in these
genes had signiﬁcantly poorer survival than those without
gene alterations. Further examination of speciﬁc groups of
type I cancers revealed poorer survival among obese women
or those with stage II–IV cancers if they had the gene
alterations (Table 1). Alterations in this gene set were also
found in 80% of ovarian cancers. However, these genes were
downregulated in a higher percentage of ovarian cancer
cases (78 of 254, 30.7%) compared with type I (4 of 123,
3.25%) and type II (0/45, 0%) endometrial cancers and were
not associated with worse survival (Table 1).
GLUT6 expression and glycolytic–lipogenic metabolism
are upregulated in endometrial cancer cells
To further investigate endometrial cancer metabolism,
we metabolically proﬁled seven human endometrial cancer
cells, including HEC-1-A (HEC), Ishikawa (ISH), MFE-296
(296), MFE-319 (319), AN3CA (AN3), RL95-2 (RL), and KLE,
and two immortalized cell lines derived from noncancerous
endometrial tissue, MAD-11 (MAD) stromal and hUE-Ts
(hUE) uterine epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, GLUT6
expression was upregulated in all seven endometrial cancer
cells compared with noncancerous endometrial cells,
whereas the expression of GLUT1 and all other glycolytic
and DNL enzymes varied between cancer and noncancer
cells (Fig. 2A and B). Akt was activated (phosphorylated) in
the majority of cancerous endometrial cells, and PTEN
expression was lost in three of the seven cancer cell lines
(Fig. 2B).
To determine whether metabolic protein expression correlated with metabolism in endometrial cells, we measured
oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidiﬁcation
rate (ECAR), and macronutrient ﬂux using radiolabeled glucose, glutamine, palmitate, and acetate tracers. Glycolysis, as
measured by the conversion of tritiated glucose to tritiated
water, was elevated in six of seven endometrial cancer cells
compared with noncancerous endometrial cells (Fig. 2C and
D), and glycolysis signiﬁcantly correlated with ECAR (r ¼ 0.858,
P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 2E). In contrast, glucose oxidation was markedly

Targeting Glucose Metabolism in Endometrial Cancer

decreased in all seven endometrial cancer cells compared with
the two noncancerous cells (Fig. 2F). The oxidation of glutamine (Fig. 2G) and palmitate (Fig. 2H) and OCR (Fig. 2I) was not
associated with a cancer phenotype. Finally, DNL from glucose,
glutamine, and acetate precursors was generally increased in
most cancer-derived cells compared with noncancerous endometrial cells (Figs. 2J–L). Correlation analyses of these data
revealed that GLUT6 protein expression signiﬁcantly correlated with Warburg-type metabolism (low glucose oxidation/
glycolysis ratio; r ¼ 0.837, P ¼ 0.005; Supplementary Fig.
S3A), and the phosphorylation of Akt signiﬁcantly correlated
with glycolysis (r ¼ 0.849, P ¼ 0.004; Supplementary Fig. S3B)
and glucose-derived lipogenesis in endometrial cells (r ¼ 0.777,
P ¼ 0.014; Supplementary Fig. S3C).
GLUT6 promotes glycolysis and survival of endometrial
cancer cells
Because GLUT6 has not been functionally characterized in
cancer cells, we evaluated the role of GLUT6 using siRNA to
knockdown this protein in 296 (Fig. 3A–I and Supplementary
Fig. S4A–S4C) and RL cells (Supplementary Fig. S4D–S4H).
Both of these cells were derived from type I endometrial
tumors from postmenopausal Caucasian women, with the RL
cells derived from an obese woman but the BMI is unknown for
the source of the 296 cells (23, 24). SMARTpool (Pool) siRNA
reduced GLUT6 protein expression in 296 cells by 65%, whereas
siRNA sequence 4 (Seq.4; a single sequence from the SMARTpool) reduced GLUT6 protein expression by 90%, compared
with controls (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Importantly, GLUT6 knockdown did not alter the expression of
GLUT1, GLUT4, and GLUT8 (GLUT8 has the most sequence
homology to GLUT6; ref. 25) in 296 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S4B).
Functional analyses revealed that GLUT6 knockdown with
the Pool siRNA reduced 296 and RL cell numbers by 62% and
59%, respectively, and with Seq.4 siRNA by 91% and 83%,
respectively (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S4E, P < 0.05).
Of note, GLUT6 knockdown with other individual siRNA
sequences (shown in Supplementary Fig. S4A) also signiﬁcantly reduced endometrial cancer cell numbers (data not
shown). Cell loss induced by GLUT6 knockdown was due to
cell death, as evidenced by morphologic alterations (Supplementary Fig. S4C), a marked increase in sub-G1 populations (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S4F), number of AVþ
cells (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. S4G), and release of
LDH from permeabilized cells (Fig. 3F and Supplementary
Fig. S4H).
To determine the role of GLUT6 in glucose metabolism,
we measured glucose uptake and glycolysis in GLUT6 knock-

down cells. Because complete knockdown of GLUT6 with
Seq.4 siRNA induced signiﬁcant cell death, the metabolism
of 296 cells was investigated using the siRNA pool. Partial
knockdown of GLUT6 expression signiﬁcantly inhibited
glucose uptake by 34% (Fig. 3G, P ¼ 0.001), glycolysis by
33% (Fig. 3H, P ¼ 0.004), and lactate release by 55% (Fig. 3I,
P < 0.001).
Targeting metabolism in endometrial cancer cells
To test whether metabolic phenotypes could be exploited in
endometrial cancer cells, we screened a panel of compounds
known to target diverse metabolic pathways. Selectivity and
toxicity of these compounds were compared with chemotherapeutics used to treat advanced-stage endometrial cancer.
Endometrial cancer and noncancer cells displayed varying
sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent carboplatin (Fig. 4A).
Notably, the noncancerous hUE cells were one of the most
sensitive to carboplatin, compared with endometrial cancer
and noncancerous MAD cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, paclitaxel
(a microtubule-stabilizing agent) showed greater selective
toxicity toward endometrial cancer cells compared with noncancer cells (Fig. 4B). This sensitivity correlated with cell
population doubling times, thereby validating the role microtubules play in cell division (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B;
r ¼ 0.796, P ¼ 0.01).
Endometrial cells were then exposed to the glycolytic
inhibitors 2-DG and BrPA (Fig. 4C and D), the lipogenesis
inhibitor 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA; Fig. 4E),
the glucose oxidation agonist dichloroacetate (DCA; Fig.
4F), the fatty acid oxidation inhibitor etomoxir (Fig. 4G),
the glucose and fatty acid uptake inhibitor, phloretin
(Fig. 4H), the glutaminolysis inhibitor, 6-diazo-5-oxo- L-norleucine (DON; Fig. 4I), and the pleiotropic metabolic inhibitor, metformin (Fig. 4J). These compounds displayed a
range of cytotoxic effects on the panel of endometrial cells
including nonselective toxicity to all cells (e.g., 2-DG,
metformin, and etomoxir), toxicity only at supraphysiologic concentrations (e.g., 2-DG and metformin), poor toxicity (e.g., DCA), or toxicity that plateaued with partial
inhibition of cell viability (DON). However, as predicted
by our metabolic ﬂux data, TOFA was toxic to the cell lines
with the highest rates of DNL and demonstrated mostly
cancer cell–speciﬁc toxicity (Fig. 4E). Curiously, of all
metabolic inhibitors, BrPA was the most disparately toxic
between cell lines, with a 37-fold difference in sensitivity
between the most sensitive (KLE, IC50 ¼ 34 mmol/L) and the
least sensitive cells (HEC, IC50 ¼ 1,267 mmol/L; Fig. 4D).
This suggested that sensitivity to BrPA was determined by
speciﬁc cellular targets.

BrPA inhibits DNL by pyruvylation of CoA
Birsoy and colleagues recently used BrPA in a global loss-offunction genetic screen to identify its selective cytotoxicity to
glycolytic tumors. Their study demonstrated that BrPA
requires monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) for transport
into cells (26). Other studies have also shown that BrPA inhibits
glycolysis by pyruvylation of GAPDH and HK2 (27). In evaluating the correlation between BrPA sensitivity and known
cellular targets, we found that the expression of MCT1 (Supplementary Fig. S5C), HK2, and GAPDH (Fig. 2A), individually,
did not correlate with sensitivity to BrPA (Supplementary
Fig. S5D).
Glycolysis and lipogenesis were the two metabolic pathways most upregulated in endometrial tumors. We therefore
investigated the effects of BrPA on these pathways in endo-

metrial cancer cells. At a toxic dose (100 mmol/L), BrPA
treatment inhibited glycolysis in 296 cells by 46% (Fig. 5A,
P < 0.0001) but had a greater inhibitory effect on DNL from
3 different lipogenic precursors such as glucose (79% decrease, P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 5B), glutamine (99% decrease, P < 0.001;
Fig. 5C), and acetate (86% decrease, P ¼ 0.0002; Fig. 5D).
DNL from these precursors requires the production of acetylCoA. As BrPA inhibited DNL from acetate, which enters
the lipogenic pathway as acetyl-CoA, we hypothesized that
BrPA inhibited DNL at, or downstream of, acetyl-CoA production. Indeed, acetyl-CoA was depleted by 99% in BrPAtreated cells (Fig. 5E; P < 0.002). The formation of acetyl-CoA
requires CoA. Because BrPA can pyruvylate free thiols (R-SH;
ref. 28), we examined whether BrPA reacted with the thiol
on CoA using a dye that ﬂuoresces once bound to free thiol

groups (Fig. 5F). Co-incubation of BrPA with CoA at a 1:1
micromolar ratio inhibited ﬂuorescent signal by 44% (P <
0.001) and a 10:1 micromolar ratio of BrPA to CoA completely
inhibited ﬂuorescent signal (Fig. 5F). These data indicated
that BrPA was directly interfering with CoA at its free thiol
group. Using a previously published ionization pattern for
CoA (29), we demonstrated by mass spectrometry that pyruvylation occurs at the sulfhydryl group of CoA (Supplementary Fig. S6).
BrPA-mediated cytotoxicity is independent of reactive
oxygen species generation
Previous studies have indicated that the antioxidant,
NAC, protects against BrPA-mediated cell death by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS; ref. 30). Because NAC also
harbors a thiol group, we postulated that NAC protects
against BrPA-mediated cell death by binding to BrPA. Indeed,

www.aacrjournals.org

we found that co-incubation of BrPA with NAC at a 1:1
micromolar ratio inhibited ﬂuorescent signal by 52% (P <
0.001) and a 10:1 micromolar ratio of BrPA to NAC completely
inhibited ﬂuorescent signal (Fig. 5G). These data suggested
that BrPA-induced cell death may not be mediated by ROS.
We therefore determined whether other antioxidants (without free thiols) could protect against BrPA-induced cell death.
Indeed, although a toxic dose of BrPA increased ROS (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B), pretreatment of endometrial
cancer cells with apocynin (Supplementary Fig. S7C), allopurinol (Supplementary Fig. S7D), N omega-nitro-L-arginine
methyl ester (L-NAME; Supplementary Fig. S7E), manganese
[III] tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP; Supplementary Fig. S7F), Mito-tempo (Supplementary Fig. S7G),
resveratrol (Supplementary Fig. S7H), or ascorbic acid (Supplementary Fig. S7I) could not protect against BrPA-mediated
cell death.

Because other antioxidants could not protect against

cytotoxicity. Indeed, pretreatment of 296 cells with CoA
(Fig. 5H) and NAC (Fig. 5I) protected from BrPA-induced
death. Similar results were reproduced in RL cells (data not
shown).
BrPA induces necrosis in vitro and inhibits endometrial
tumor growth in vivo
BrPA inhibits glycolytic–lipogenic metabolism and depletes intracellular ATP (60% decrease at 1.5 hours, P < 0.0001;
Supplementary Fig. S8A). These alterations can induce cell
death by multiple mechanisms. Using UV irradiation as a
positive control, we evaluated the effects of BrPA on classic
features of apoptosis. Treatment of 296 cells with BrPA did

5842

not induce dynamic membrane blebbing (BrPA-treated
cells are shown in Fig. 6A and UV-irradiated cells in Supplementary Fig. S8B), DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6B), an increase
in apoptotic cell populations (AVþ/7-AAD negative; Fig. 6C),
or activation of caspases (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, BrPA-mediated cell death was associated with an increase in LDH
release, and this was not prevented by the pan-caspase
inhibitor, Q-VD-OPH (QVD; Fig. 6E and Supplementary Fig.
S8C). From these observations, we conclude that BrPA-mediated cell death was due to necrosis. Because BrPA kills
endometrial cancer cells in vitro, we tested the efﬁcacy
of this agent against endometrial tumors in vivo. BrPA (2.5
mg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was administered to nude mice with
palpable 296 tumors (Fig. 6F). As a single agent, BrPA
dramatically inhibited tumor growth compared with vehicle
controls (Fig. 6G and H).

Targeting Glucose Metabolism in Endometrial Cancer

Discussion
Increased glucose metabolism (glycolysis) and ﬂux through
lipogenesis is a hallmark feature of many cancers, providing
structural molecules and aiding intracellular signaling and
transport that is required for cancer progression (31). Analyses
of TCGA data sets found that 40% to 68% of endometrial
cancers (type I and II) harbor alterations in the glycolytic–
lipogenic genes that we observed in our cohort of patient
samples. Interestingly, only women with type I tumors who had
these alterations (including those with stages II–IV and obese
patients) had worse overall survival than those without. In
contrast, in ovarian cancer (a malignancy not typically associated with obesity), alterations in these genes were more
common (80% of cases) but were more frequently downregulated and not associated with survival. While it is clear that
alterations in genes controlling glycolytic–lipogenic processes
are not unique to endometrial cancer, this metabolic pathway
appears to impact the outcome of treatment and/or disease
progression in women with type I endometrial cancer. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of this pathway may improve survival rates for these subsets of patients.
Facilitative glucose uptake feeds glycolytic–lipogenic
metabolism and is regulated by the GLUT family (GLUTs
1–14). Many of these are expressed in the uterus and some,
including the ubiquitously expressed GLUT1, are elevated in
endometrial cancer (25, 32–35). GLUT1 is thought to contribute to basal glucose uptake in normal tissues, and
upregulation of this transporter has been reported in many
malignancies (36). In this study, GLUT1 expression was only
increased in some of our patient tumor samples and it was
not speciﬁc to cancerous endometrial cells. In contrast,
GLUT6 was the most elevated glucose transporter in malignant endometrial tissue and it was the only protein specifically upregulated in endometrial cancer cells. Furthermore,
we demonstrated that GLUT6 promotes glycolysis and survival of endometrial cancer cells, despite the expression of
other glucose transporters. These data suggest that either
endometrial cancer cells become dependent on glucose
uptake via GLUT6 or GLUT6 may have other roles in cancer
biology that remain to be discovered.
Metabolic proﬁling of endometrial cancer cells showed
higher rates of glycolysis and lower glucose oxidation than
their nonmalignant counterparts. However, oxidative
metabolism in general was not defective in endometrial
cancer cells. Our results suggest that glucose oxidation is
speciﬁcally decreased in endometrial cancer cells by a
mechanism that is independent of a dysfunction in mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or oxidative phosphorylation machinery. Furthermore, our data support the
concept that glucose-derived carbons are preferentially used
by cancer cells for macromolecule synthesis to promote cell
proliferation (37, 38). Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway in cancer cells is thought to contribute to this
metabolic phenotype by stimulating glucose transport and
metabolism. In our study, activation of Akt was associated
with increased glycolytic–lipogenic metabolism in endometrial cancer cells. Activation of Akt also inﬂuences protein

www.aacrjournals.org

synthesis through mTOR, and alterations in this pathway
have been reported in endometrial cancer (13, 39). However,
in our cohort of patients, we found that TSC2 expression
(negative regulator of mTOR) and the phosphorylation of
S6K1 (an mTOR target that regulates protein synthesis) were
similar in endometrial tumor versus adjacent nontumor
tissue. Together, our data provide support for Akt activation
as a central regulator of glycolytic–lipogenic metabolism in
cancer cells.
In recent years, a number of studies have reported the
anticancer activity of BrPA (26, 27, 40–46), and a modiﬁed
formula of BrPA was effective at reducing the growth of
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in a human patient (28).
However, the metabolic consequences, molecular targets,
and mechanism of action for this agent remain unclear. In
endometrial cells, it appears that sensitivity to BrPA is not
solely mediated by the expression of an individual protein.
We also found that BrPA is a potent inhibitor of lipogenesis,
by depleting the lipid precursor acetyl-CoA. Other studies
have reported that BrPA lowers acetyl-CoA levels in noncancer cells (47, 48), although our study is the ﬁrst to report
that the mechanism for acetyl-CoA depletion is due to
pyruvylation of CoA. CoA is an important cofactor for
intermediary nutrient metabolism and is thought to be
involved in up to 4% of all cellular enzymatic reactions
(49). Therefore, BrPA has the ability to alter numerous
metabolic reactions by pyruvylating thiols, including that
of the intracellular reducing agent glutathione (GSH), as
proposed earlier (40, 50). GSH is important for protecting
cells against ROS, and it has been suggested that BrPAmediated cell death is due to oxidative stress (30). However,
in this study, BrPA-induced cell death was not protected by
any antioxidant except the thiol-containing NAC. We therefore propose that BrPA-induced cell death is not due to
increased ROS generation at least in endometrial cancer
cells.
Overall, this study supports an important role for glucose
metabolism in endometrial tumor growth. More speciﬁcally,
endometrial cancer cells may rely on GLUT6-mediated
glucose transport and glycolytic–lipogenic metabolism for
survival and these features represent vulnerabilities that are
amenable to therapeutic intervention. BrPA may prove
useful to treat endometrial cancer because it is a dual
glycolytic–lipogenic inhibitor. However, the pleiotropic
effects of this agent may limit its administration for anticancer therapy. As such, a modiﬁed formula or targeted
delivery of BrPA to tumors may be required to reduce offtarget toxicity. From a clinical standpoint, our data suggest
that maintenance of blood glucose levels by regulation of
dietary intake and/or administration of hypoglycemic agents
may be helpful at reducing the growth of endometrial
tumors. Future studies are required to delineate the role of
glucose availability and metabolism in the etiology of endometrial cancer.
