Abstract
The ability of tumor cells to invade and metastasize requires
deregulation of interactions with adjacent cells and the
extracellular matrix. A major challenge of cancer biology is to
observe the dynamics of the proteins involved in this process in
their functional and physiologic context. Here, for the first time,
we have used photobleaching and photoactivation to compare
the mobility of cell adhesion and plasma membrane probes
in vitro and in tumors grown in mice (in vivo). We find
differences between in vitro and in vivo recovery dynamics of
two key molecules, the tumor suppressor E-cadherin and the
membrane-targeting sequence of H-Ras. Our data show that
E-cadherin dynamics are significantly faster in vivo compared
with cultured cells, that the ratio of E-cadherin stabilized in
cell-cell junctions is significantly higher in vivo, and that
E-cadherin mobility correlates with cell migration. Moreover,
quantitative imaging has allowed us to assess the effects of
therapeutic intervention on E-cadherin dynamics using dasatinib, a clinically approved Src inhibitor, and show clear
differences in the efficacy of drug treatment in vivo. Our results
show for the first time the utility of photobleaching and
photoactivation in the analysis of dynamic biomarkers in living
animals. Furthermore, this work highlights critical differences
in molecular dynamics in vitro and in vivo, which have
important implications for the use of cultured disease models
as surrogates for living tissue. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):2714–9]

Introduction
Animal models have rapidly become essential tools in cancer
research; from the determination of basic biological mechanisms to
the study of complex human diseases. The analysis of molecular
dynamics in an intact host environment, however, remains a major
challenge. Fluorescence microscopy has been used to probe
molecular dynamics of key proteins within two-dimensional cell
cultures (1, 2), but in vivo conditions are more restrictive (3–5),
and it is unclear to what extent these in vitro techniques can be
applied in vivo. It is therefore important and necessary to develop
techniques for the quantification of molecular dynamics in vivo.
Cell-cell interactions mediated by E-cadherin are central to
maintaining normal tissue epithelial architecture and have been

studied in great detail in vitro (6). The disruption and deregulation
of E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell adhesions in cancer is a critical
initiation step in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition
associated with an invasive phenotype (7). Alterations in
E-cadherin dynamics could therefore serve as an early molecular
biomarker of metastasis. In order to study E-cadherin and
membrane dynamics in their physiologic context, we have applied
two complimentary techniques, photobleaching and photoactivation of fluorescence, to visualize protein dynamics in cell-cell
junctions and the plasma membrane in tumor xenografts (8–10).
Photobleaching is frequently used for the characterization of
molecular dynamics within cultured cells. In the simplest
approach, the fluorescence within a small region of the sample is
bleached using a laser and the recovery of fluorescence into the
bleached region is measured over time (11). Photoactivation is a
related technique, in which a nonfluorescent (caged) precursor
becomes fluorescent upon activation (10). In both cases, two basic
variables are derived, (a) the half-time of recovery, an indication of
the rate at which probes move in or out of the analysis region, and
(b) the immobile fraction, an indication of how much of the probe
remains trapped and unable to move out of the analyzed region.
Using this approach, we have successfully quantified E-cadherin
dynamics in a three-dimensional host setting and provided a
molecular readout of the early mobilization events in tumor cells.
Our results highlight the necessity and advantages of live animal
imaging in the study of tumor development and metastasis, and
show that photobleaching and photoactivation can be used in vivo
for the quantification of drug action in the treatment of cancer.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids. GFP-E-cadherin and PAGFP were kind gifts from Jennifer
Stow (Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland, St.
Lucia, Queensland, Australia) and Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (Cell
Biology and Metabolism Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD), respectively.
PAGFPFarn2Palm was made by substituting GFP in the pEGFP-N1 vector
with PAGFP-Farn2Palm ( for cloning, see Supplementary Materials).
Cell lines. A431 cells were obtained from (American Type Culture
Collection), and maintained as described. The cell-derived matrix was
generated as described previously (12). Cells (2  105) were plated onto the
cell-derived matrix and cells within colonies or migrating cells were
targeted for photobleaching and analyzed as described in the Supplementary Materials.

E-Cadherin Photoactivation and Photobleaching In vivo

to play a key role in cell migration and invasion (6, 7). We therefore
used photobleaching to assess whether we could quantify differences in E-cadherin dynamics between stationary and migrating
cells. A431 carcinoma cells were plated on cell-derived matrix, and
cell junctions between collectively migrating or confluent nonmotile cells were targeted for bleaching (refs. 13, 14; Fig. 1A and B;
Supplementary Movies 1 and 2, respectively). Photobleaching
recovery curves from migrating or stationary cells were pooled
and analyzed (Fig. 1C). The half-time of GFP-E-cadherin recovery
was reduced by 16 seconds in the junctions of cells restrained in
colonies (Fig. 1D), and the fraction of GFP-E-cadherin stabilized in
cell-cell junctions was 58% higher in confluent cells compared with

migrating cells (47.4 F 1.4% for confluent compared with 30.0 F
1.5% for migrating cells; Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained
comparing mobile cells at the leading edge of a monolayer wound
with confluent nonmigrating cells at the rear of the wound (data
not shown). The higher level of GFP-E-cadherin trapped at the cellcell junctions of stationary cells shows a correlation between cell
migration and the level of GFP-E-cadherin trapped within cell-cell
junctions. We therefore wanted to assess whether the immobile
fraction of GFP-E-cadherin could be measured in vivo and serve as
a biomarker for migration potential.
Photobleaching of GFP-E-cadherin shows fundamental
differences in E-cadherin mobility in vivo . To examine

GFP-E-cadherin dynamics in vivo, cells were grown as subcutaneous tumors in nude mice and compared with GFP-E-cadherin
in the junctions of confluent cells cultured in vitro. In both
cases, GFP-E-cadherin was similarly localized to the cell periphery
(Fig. 2A and B). Cell-cell junctions could be imaged up to f70 Am
deep in tumor tissue and effectively bleached at f20 Am, which
enabled cells completely surrounded by others to be targeted
for bleaching, analogous to the confluent cells targeted in vitro.
Initial observation of time-lapse movies suggested that the rate
of recovery was much faster in vivo than in vitro. Analysis of
pooled recovery curves (Fig. 2C) confirmed that the half-time of
recovery was four times faster in vivo (15.3 F 1.2 seconds in vivo
compared with 60.5 F 2.5 seconds in vitro; Fig. 2D). Furthermore,
the fraction of GFP-E-cadherin stabilized in cell-cell junctions was
1.5 times greater in vivo (Fig. 2D). These results show that the
mobility of the tumor suppressor E-cadherin, a key protein
implicated in the early stages of invasion, is substantially different
in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, these differences have profound

implications for cancer research, in which the behavior of Ecadherin in cultured disease models is used to elucidate basic
biological mechanisms which are extrapolated back into human
disease (6, 7).
Photoactivation shows fundamental differences in plasma
membrane dynamics in vivo. Protein mobility within the
plasma membrane also plays a fundamentally important role
during cell migration (12, 15). We therefore examined whether
plasma membrane dynamics might also differ in the intact host
environment compared with cell culture models. To answer this
question, we used photoactivatable GFP anchored to the plasma
membrane through the farnesylated and doubly palmitoylated
membrane targeting sequence of H-Ras (PAGFP-Farn2Palm;
ref. 16). Cells were stably transfected with the membrane probe,
cultured in vitro or in vivo, and targeted for photoactivation.
In vitro, the activated fluorescence was observed to undergo
rapid and virtually complete lateral diffusion (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Movie 5). However, initial observations in vivo suggested

that like E-cadherin, a significant proportion of the membrane
probe remained trapped in the site of activation (Fig. 3B;
Supplementary Movie 6). Analysis of pooled PAGFP-Farn2Palm
decay curves (Fig. 3C) revealed a similar half-time of recovery
in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3D). However, the immobile fraction of
the membrane probe was more than five times greater in vivo
than in vitro (40.00 F 4.1% in vivo compared with 7.5 F 6.5%
in vitro; Fig. 3D). Thus, in a similar manner to E-cadherin, we
found a substantial increase in the fraction of the membrane
probe trapped in vivo compared with in vitro (compare Figs. 2D
and 3D). The altered dynamics of both E-cadherin and the
plasma membrane in vivo may occur as a result of different

environmental cues within the host such as interactions with
stromal cells and the extracellular matrix and are currently
under investigation.
Dasatinib treatment enhances the stability of E-cadherin
in cell-cell junctions in vivo but not in vitro. Drug discovery
involves the validation of drugs and targets in vitro to be used
for therapeutic intervention in vivo. The high attrition rates of
compounds entering clinical trials (17) suggests that drug
discovery may be particularly sensitive to the kinds of differences in molecular dynamics in vitro and in vivo that we have
observed here for E-cadherin and the membrane probe. We
therefore addressed whether photobleaching could be used to

compare the effects of pharmacologic intervention in vitro
with in vivo. This approach could provide valuable in vivo
preclinical data for validating mechanisms of action and guiding
dosing regimes. We selected dasatinib, a dual Src/Abl tyrosine
kinase inhibitor under consideration for use as an anti-invasive
drug in epithelial tumors (18). Although the mechanism of
action is not fully understood, it may include effects on
E-cadherin dynamics known to be regulated by Src tyrosine
kinase activity (19, 20).
Cells were cultured in vitro and in vivo, and treated with
dasatinib (20) prior to photobleaching of GFP-E-cadherin.
Dasatinib treatment caused no change in E-cadherin levels
(Supplementary Fig. S2); however, photobleaching analysis
revealed that dasatinib treatment shortened the rate of GFPE-cadherin recovery both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 4A).
Remarkably, photobleaching analysis also revealed that drug
treatment had no effect on the immobile fraction of E-cadherin
in vitro but doubled the fraction of E-cadherin trapped in cellcell junctions in vivo (Fig. 4B). This striking increase in the
immobile fraction of E-cadherin in vivo ( from 29.5 F 4.9% to
65.4 F 2.3%) is significant in relation to our earlier finding that
more GFP-E-cadherin is immobilized in junctions between
confluent nonmigrating cells within colonies or at the rear of
a wound (Fig. 1D; results not shown). This result lends support
to a possible mechanism of dasatinib as an anti-invasive drug
through the stabilization of cell-cell adhesion, and would be
missed by cell culture–based screening assays typically used in
drug discovery.
To assess the specificity of the E-cadherin response to
dasatinib treatment, E-cadherin recovery dynamics were compared with membrane recovery dynamics in vitro and in vivo.
Dasatinib had no effect on either the half-time of recovery or
the immobile fraction of the membrane probe in vitro (results
not shown). In vivo, the half-time of recovery was similar for
both GFP-E-cadherin and the membrane probe. However,
dasatinib treatment had significantly different effects on the
immobile fraction of GFP-E-cadherin and the membrane probe
in vivo: drug treatment increased the immobile fraction of GFPE-cadherin by a factor of 2 but decreased the immobile fraction
of the membrane probe by a factor of 1.6 ( from 40.00 F 4.1%
to 24.7 F 4.0%; Fig. 4C). This highlights the selectivity of
dasatinib for E-cadherin in vivo independent of membrane
dynamics.
In summary, we have shown the first use of photobleaching
and photoactivation to monitor molecular dynamics in living
tumors. Our results show that fundamental cellular properties
such as the mobility of cell-cell adhesion components or plasma
membrane proteins are different in vitro and in vivo. Photobleaching offers the potential to probe the spatial and temporal
dynamics of cell-cell junctions in a context-dependent manner;
for example, depending on the proximity to migratory stimuli.
Such in vivo analysis enables the quantification of subtle early
changes in protein behavior in response to therapeutic
intervention, which might be missed using cell culture models.
The altered mobility of the membrane targeting sequence of
H-Ras in vivo highlights the potential that other membranetargeted signal transduction molecules may behave differently
than expected in vivo. Our data critically highlight a shortcoming
of conventional drug discovery, the use of cell culture models
which fail to recapitulate the behavior of cells in living
organisms, and emphasize the importance of early in vivo

adaptation of these techniques for real-time live animal imaging
can be extended to the analysis of other key dynamic
biomarkers or oncogenes during the study of cancer progression
and should provide an in-depth understanding of molecular
behavior in a spatial, temporal, and now, contextual setting.
