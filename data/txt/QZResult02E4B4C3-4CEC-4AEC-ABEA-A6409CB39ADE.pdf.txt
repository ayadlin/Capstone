Abstract
Sunscreens partially filter UVB and, therefore, could partially
prevent skin cancer; however, efficient approaches are desired
to effectively prevent photocarcinogenesis. It is hypothesized
that nontoxic pharmacologically active natural compounds
can increase photoprotective effects. Our completed studies
suggest that silibinin, a bioactive phytochemical, strongly
prevents photocarcinogenesis; however, its mechanism is not
fully understood. Herein, for the first time, we used a clinically
relevant UVB dose (30 mJ/cm2/day) to examine the photoprotective effect and associated mechanisms of silibinin in
SKH1 hairless mice. Topical or dietary silibinin treatment
caused a strong protection against photocarcinogenesis in
terms of delay in tumor appearance, multiplicity, and volume.
Analyses of normal skin, uninvolved skin from tumor-bearing
mice, and skin tumors showed a statistically significant
decrease (P < 0.05–0.001) in inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) levels by silibinin.
Concomitantly, phospho–signal transducers and activators
of transcription 3 (Tyr705) and phospho-p65(Ser536) were also
decreased by silibinin, which are potential up-stream regulators of iNOS and COX-2. Simultaneously, silibinin also
decreased UVB-caused increase in cell proliferation and
microvessel density. In tumors, hypoxia-inducible factor 1A
(HIF-1A) and vascular endothelial growth factor protein levels
were decreased by silibinin. Further analysis showed that
silibinin inhibited UVB-caused phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation of STAT3 and p65, as well as nuclear factor KB
(NF-KB) DNA binding activity. Together, these results suggest
that silibinin causes a strong protective effect against photocarcinogenesis via down-regulation of inflammatory and
angiogenic responses, involving HIF-1A, STAT3, and NF-KB
transcription factors, as well as COX2 and iNOS. [Cancer Res
2007;67(7):3483–91]

Introduction
UVB radiation–induced skin damages can potentially cause
precancerous and cancerous skin lesions, mostly nonmelanoma
skin cancer, and also accelerate skin aging. It involves an imbalance
of endogenous antioxidant system, leading to an increase in free
radical levels and inflammation. Along with production of reactive
oxygen species, UVB also causes direct DNA damage to exert its

detrimental effect (1, 2). In photocarcinogenesis, oxidative stress
and activation of various signaling cascades, including receptor
and nonreceptor tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, play major
role in clonal expansion of UVB-initiated cells into visible skin
tumors (3). Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3
(STAT3) and phospho-p65 subunit of nuclear factor nB (NF-nB) are
key mediators for many cytokines/growth factors–receptors
signaling (4). Both these transcription factors are constitutively
active in many human tumors and contribute to oncogenesis,
including skin tumorigenesis (5).
Recent studies reveal that persistently active STAT3 induces
tumor angiogenesis by up-regulation of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) expression and also modulates immune
functions in favor of tumor immune evasion (6). Activated NF-nB
often facilitates transcription of numerous genes, including
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2
(COX-2), involved in inflammation and tumorigenesis (7). Both
iNOS and NF-nB are induced by UVB, and because NF-nB
responsive elements are functionally present in iNOS, it indicates
a possible role of UVB-induced NF-nB activation in iNOS
expression (8). COX-2 is also involved in enhancing cell proliferation and up-regulation of angiogenesis (9, 10). UVB is shown
to enhance COX-2 protein level in both human and mouse skin
(10–15). Another molecule, hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a) is
also known to increase VEGF expression (16). Studies with genistein, all-trans retinoic acid and carbazol have shown to antagonize
UVB-caused inflammation and angiogenesis through different
signal transduction pathways (17–19). These studies indicate
potential role of iNOS and COX-2 in UVB-caused inflammation,
angiogenesis, and skin tumorigenesis.
Our recent studies have shown that silibinin, a naturally occurring
flavanolignan, causes strong protection against photocarcinogenesis
(20–24) and inhibits UVB and chemical tumor promoters–induced
skin inflammation and edema (25); however, its comprehensive
mechanisms are not understood. Present study, for the first time, was
designed to use a chronic UVB dose in physiologic range to induce
photocarcinogenesis in mice. Animal exposure to this UVB dose
(30 mJ/cm2/day) is in close range of human exposure to sunlight
and, therefore, has more translational significance (26) compared
with higher doses used in previous studies. We studied end points
of photocarcinogenesis, including tumor incidence, multiplicity,
and volume, and underlying molecular alterations.

Experimental design. Female SKH-1 hairless mice (5 weeks old) were
from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). Silibinin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) diet
(1%, w/w) was prepared by Dyets (Bethlehem, PA). UVB light source was
four FS-40-T-12-UVB sunlamps with UVB Spectra 305 Dosimeter (Daavlin,
Bryan, OH), emitting 80% radiation within 280 to 340nm with 314-nm peak

as described earlier (21). Treatment groups, each with 25 mice, were (a)
unirradiated and untreated (control); (b) 9 mg silibinin in 200 AL acetone
per mouse topical (SBT); (c) 1% silibinin fed in diet (SBF); (d) 30 mJ/cm2
UVB, 5 days/week for 25 weeks (UVB); (e) SBT 30 min before UVB (SB +
UVB); ( f ) SBT immediately after UVB (UVB + SB); and (g ) SBF and UVB
(SBF + UVB). Rationale for these protocols was based on completed studies
showing silibinin efficacy against photocarcinogenesis and acute UVBcaused changes in mouse skin after identical treatments but with higher
UVB dose (21, 23). Body weight and diet consumption were recorded
throughout the experiment. Mice were sacrificed when all the mice had
tumors in groups 4 to 7 (25 weeks post-UVB), and results were analyzed for
tumor incidence, multiplicity, and volume. Parts of skin and tumors were
collected and fixed in buffered formalin for immunohistochemical analyses,
and remainder flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for molecular analyses.
Immunohistochemical staining. Tissue processing, serial section
preparation, and other details are described recently (21–24). Sections were
incubated with 1:100 dilution for iNOS (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA),
COX-2, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1;
M-20), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)
and 1:50 dilution for phospho-STAT3(Tyr705; D3A7), phospho-p65(Ser276; Cell
Signaling, Beverly, CA) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature followed by
overnight at 4jC. Then sections were incubated with appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (1:250 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature,
followed by 45 min incubation with conjugated horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) streptavidin, and with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine for 10 min at room
temperature. Sections were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin. To rule
out nonspecific staining, sections were incubated with N-Universal Negative
Control mouse or rabbit antibody (Dako). Immunohistochemical analyses
were done using Zeiss Axioscop 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany).
Western immunoblotting. Total tissue lysates and nuclear and cytosolic
fractions were prepared as published earlier (21, 23, 27). Equal amounts of
protein from desired samples were resolved on Tris-glycine gel, transferred
onto nitrocellulose membrane and blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk.
Membranes were incubated with primary antibody for phosphorylated and
total STAT3 and p65 (Cell Signaling), iNOS (BD Biosciences), HIF-1a (Novus
Biologicals, Littleton, CO), COX-2, VEGF (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), and
a-tubulin (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) overnight at 4jC, and then with HRPconjugated secondary antibody, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence.
Purity of cytosolic and nuclear fractions was established by blotting
membranes with anti–glutathione S-transferase (GST)-k (MBL, Nagoya,
Japan) and histone H1 (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA) antibodies. Blots were
scanned with Adobe Photoshop 6.0 with minimum background.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Consensus sequences of doublestranded NF-nB oligonucleotide (5¶-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3¶
and 3¶-TCA ACT CCC CTG AAA GGG TCC G-5¶ from Santa Cruz) were endlabeled with g-32P-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/mL) as per manufacturer’s
protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Labeled probe was separated from free
g-32P-ATP using G-25 Sephadex column. Nuclear extract (8 Ag) was
incubated with 5 gel shift binding buffer (Promega) and then with
32
P-labeled NF-nB probe for 20 min at 37jC. In super shift and competition
assays, nuclear extract was incubated with anti-p65 or p50 antibody or
unlabeled-oligo before adding labeled NF-nB oligo. Unlabeled mutant
NF-nB oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz) was also used to further establish the
specificity of DNA-protein complex. DNA retardation gel (6%) was used to
resolve DNA-protein or DNA-protein-antibody complexes followed by gel
drying and autoradiography.
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using SigmaStat 2.03 software,
and statistical significance of difference between UVB alone versus all other
groups was determined by ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni t test
for multiple comparisons. Between groups, comparison was done by t test.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

mice by 18 weeks; however, it took 21 weeks to get tumors in all
mice in three different silibinin-treated plus UVB-exposed groups
(data not shown). First tumor appearance in UVB-alone animals
occurred at 14th week, which was delayed by 2 weeks in silibinintreated groups (data not shown). Silibinin treatments in three
different protocols showed lower tumor numbers throughout
the experiment, and at the end of study at 25 weeks, 26% to 45%
(P < 0.001) decrease in tumor number per mouse was observed
compared with UVB group (Fig. 1A). Tumor volume per mouse also
decreased from 96.2 F 15.6 mm3 in UVB group to 25.2 F 4.7, 30.1 F
2.8, and 21.4 F 1.5 mm3 in presilibinin or postsilibinin topical or
dietary group, respectively, accounting for 69% to 78% (P < 0.001)
decrease (Fig. 1B). Overall, three different modes of silibinin
treatments (pre-UVB or post-UVB topical or dietary) showed
almost similar effects on tumor number and volume. None of
the silibinin treatments caused any decrease in diet consumption
(Fig. 1C) or body weight (Fig. 1D) compared with controls.
Together, these results convincingly indicate that silibinin, as
opposed to sunscreens, acts at molecular level to provide
protective effect against photocarcinogenesis without any toxicity.
In further studies, potential molecular targets of silibinin in its
photoprotective effects were examined.
Silibinin treatments decrease iNOS expression in UVBexposed mouse skin and skin tumors. Induction in iNOS
expression is a potential mechanism to induce many physiologic,
as well as pathophysiologic, processes, including inflammation and
angiogenesis (7). Thus far, the effect of physiologic dose of UVB has
not been investigated on iNOS. Here, we observed that chronic
exposure of physiologic dose of UVB strongly increases the
immunoreactivity of iNOS throughout the skin epidermis compared
with sham-irradiated and only-silibinin (topical or diet) treated
groups of mice (data not shown). Quantification of immunostaining
showed 22 F 2% iNOS-positive cells in UVB-alone group; however,
pre-UVB or post-UVB topical silibinin or its feeding showed
14 F 1%, 12 F 1%, and 12 F 1% iNOS-positive cells, respectively,
accounting for 36% to 46% (P V 0.001) decrease (Fig. 2A, left).
Similarly, strong immunostaining for iNOS was observed in UVBirradiated skin tumors, which was also decreased in the tumors
from silibinin-treated groups (data not shown). Quantification
for iNOS-positive cells in skin tumors showed 34 F 4% cells in
UVB-alone group, which was decreased by 29% to 34% to 24 F 2%
(P V 0.05), 23 F 2% (P V 0.01), and 23 F 2% (P V 0.01) iNOS-positive
cells in pre-UVB or post-UVB topical or dietary silibinin group,
respectively (Fig. 2A, right). These results were further confirmed by
immunoblot analysis. Consistent with immunostaining data,
physiologic dose of chronic UVB exposure strongly increased iNOS
levels in both epidermis (Fig. 2C, left) and skin tumors (Fig. 2C, right)
compared with normal skin, which were profoundly decreased in
silibinin-treated epidermis (Fig. 2C, left) and tumor (Fig. 2C, right)
samples. Overall, these results suggest iNOS as a potential molecular
target in photoprotective effects of silibinin.
Silibinin treatments decrease COX-2 expression in UVBexposed mouse skin and skin tumors. In addition to iNOS,
COX-2 is also implicated in UVB-induced skin inflammation and
photocarcinogenesis (12). To assess whether silibinin efficacy
against UVB-induced skin inflammation and photocarcinogenesis
also involves alteration in COX-2, tissue samples were analyzed for
COX-2 levels. UVB-alone group showed increased immunoreactivity for COX-2 in both epidermis and skin tumors (data not shown).
In control mice, 6 F 1% COX-2–positive cells were observed in
epidermis compared with f3 F 0.5% in topical or dietary silibinin

group (Fig. 2B, left). After UVB exposure, COX-2–positive cells
increased to 26 F 2% in epidermis; however, topical silibinin
treatment before or immediately after UVB or its dietary feeding
reduced COX-2–positive cells to 10 F 1% (P V 0.001), 11 F 1% (P V
0.001), and 11 F 1% (P V 0.001), respectively, accounting for 58% to
62% decrease (Fig. 2B, left). Similarly, UVB-alone group showed
38 F 3% COX-2–positive cells in skin tumors which was decreased
(26–40%) by silibinin treatments showing 26 F 2% (P V 0.01), 28 F
2% (P V 0.05), and 23 F 2% (P V 0.001) COX-2–positive cells in preUVB or post-UVB topical silibinin or dietary silibinin group,
respectively (Fig. 2B, right). These results were further confirmed by
immunoblotting, in which, compared with normal skin, chronic
physiologic dose of UVB strongly increased COX-2 levels in
epidermis (Fig. 2C, left) and skin tumors (Fig. 2C, right), which
were decreased by silibinin treatments. These results indicate that,
in addition to iNOS, silibinin also targets COX-2 expression in its
photoprotective effects.
Silibinin inhibits cell proliferation in photocarcinogenesis.
Persistent inflammation causes hyperproliferation in epidermis,
and enhanced proliferation rate is hallmark of tumor cells (28). We
therefore examined the effect of physiologic dose of UVB exposure
without or with silibinin treatments on proliferation status of
epidermis and skin tumors by measuring PCNA level. Quantitative
analysis revealed 2 F 0.6% PCNA–positive cells in unirradiated
mouse epidermis, which were comparable with silibinin alone
treatments (Fig. 3A, left). Chronic UVB exposure for 25 weeks
showed 29 F 3% PCNA-positive cells, which were decreased to
17 F 2% (P V 0.001), 17 F 2% (P V 0.001), and 20 F 2% (P V 0.005)
by pre-UVB or post-UVB topical or dietary silibinin, respectively
(Fig. 3A, left). Similarly, in skin tumors, UVB-alone group showed
33 F 1% PCNA-positive cells which were decreased to 20 F 2%
(P V 0.001), 18 F 2% (P V 0.001), and 21 F 2% (P V 0.001) by
silibinin treatments, respectively (Fig. 3A, right). These results
indicate the antiproliferative mechanism of silibinin in its photoprotective effect against physiologically relevant dose of UVBcaused skin tumorigenesis.
Silibinin inhibits angiogenesis in photocarcinogenesis. Apart
from inflammation, iNOS and COX-2 are also implicated in
angiogenesis; therefore, we next examined effect of physiologic
dose of UVB exposure without or with silibinin treatments on
angiogenic variables. Quantitative analyses of PECAM-1, an
endothelial cell marker, immunostaining in control skin showed
2 F 0.2% positive cells which did not alter after silibinin
treatments (Fig. 3B, left). PECAM-1–positive cells were increased
to 8 F 0.9% in UVB group which were decreased by silibinin
treatments to 6 F 0.6% (P V 0.01), 6 F 0.8% (P V 0.01), and 6 F
0.8% (P V 0.05) in pre-UVB or post-UVB topical or dietary group,
respectively (Fig. 3B, left). Similarly, in skin tumors, there were
12 F 1% PECAM-1–positive cells in UVB group (higher than UVBtreated skin) which were significantly reduced to 6 F 0.6% (P V
0.001), 7 F 0.9% (P V 0.001), and 8 F 0.7% (P V 0.05) in silibinin
treatment groups, respectively (Fig. 3B, right). These results
suggest potential antiangiogenic activity of silibinin in its photoprotective effects, which we further investigated by immunoblotting for VEGF, a potent mitogen for endothelial cells. Compared
with normal skin, chronic physiologic dose of UVB alone showed
high level of VEGF expression in both epidermis (Fig. 3C, left) and
skin tumors (Fig. 3C, right); however, silibinin treatments in three
different protocols showed strongly reduced VEGF levels in both
epidermis and skin tumor (Fig. 3C). Because HIF-1a is a potential
transcription factor for VEGF expression, we next examined its

role in VEGF expression in our experimental conditions.
Consistent with VEGF results, compared with unirradiated skin,
UVB showed increased HIF-1a protein levels in both epidermis
(Fig. 3C, left) and tumors (Fig. 3C, right), which were decreased by
all the three modes of silibinin treatments. Overall, in addition to
iNOS and COX-2, these results suggest a potential role of HIF-1a–
mediated VEGF induction and angiogenesis in photocarcinogenesis, which was targeted by silibinin in exerting its protective
effects.
Silibinin inhibits STAT3(Tyr705) phosphorylation and its
nuclear translocation in photocarcinogenesis. Because we
observed that iNOS, COX-2, and VEGF are up-regulated by UVB
in both skin and tumors and were subsequently decreased by
silibinin in its efficacy against photocarcinogenesis, we examined
STAT3 status, which is known to transcriptionally activate these
inflammatory and angiogenic molecules. Immunohistochemical
analysis of skin for STAT3(Tyr705) phosphorylation, an activated
form of STAT3, showed 3 F 0.4% phospho-STAT3(Tyr705)–positive
cells in unirradiated mice without or with silibinin treatments
(Fig. 4A). When mice were exposed to UVB, an elevated level of
phospho-STAT3 immunostaining was observed in epidermis (data
not shown), which accounted for 28 F 2% phospho-STAT3(Tyr705)–
positive cells which were reduced by 29% to 46% to 15 F 2% (P V
0.001), 19 F 2% (P V 0.001), and 20 F 2% (P V 0.001) after three
different silibinin treatments, respectively (Fig. 4A). Similarly, skin
tumors from UVB group showed 32 F 2% phospho-STAT3(Tyr705)–
positive cells which were decreased by 25% to 44% to 22 F 2% (P V
0.01), 24 F 2% (P V 0.05), and 18 F 2% (P V 0.001) in pre-UVB or
post-UVB topical or dietary silibinin groups, respectively (Fig. 4B).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

Skin samples were further analyzed by immunoblotting for
phosphorylated and total STAT3 levels in cytosolic and nuclear
fractions; tumor tissues could not be analyzed due to the limited
amount. Consistent with immunostaining data, UVB-alone samples
showed an increased level of phospho-STAT3(Tyr705) as well as
total STAT3 in cytosolic extract from epidermis; however, this
increase was more prominent in nuclear fraction compared with
that of normal skin (Fig. 4C). Regarding silibinin-treated samples in
three different protocols plus UVB, there was either no effect or
only a slight decrease in both phosphorylated and total STAT3
levels in cytosolic fraction; however, both these levels decreased
very strongly to almost normal skin level in nuclear fraction. Purity
of cytosolic and nuclear fractions was established by also blotting
membranes with anti–GST-k and histone H1 antibodies, which
clearly showed immunoreactivity only for cytosolic and nuclear
specific proteins (Fig. 4C), respectively. These results suggest that
silibinin strongly inhibits UVB-induced STAT3(Tyr705) phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation, which is necessary for STAT3
transcriptional activity. These results also suggest that physiologic
dose of UVB activates STAT3 signaling in photocarcinogenesis,
which could effectively be targeted by silibinin in its photoprotective effects.
Silibinin inhibits p65 phosphorylation and NF-KB activation
in photocarcinogenesis. NF-nB transcription factor is activated
by UVB that mediates many processes involved in inflammation
and angiogenesis (7). In this regard, because iNOS, COX-2, as well
as VEGF could also be transcriptionally activated by NF-nB (6, 7),
we next assessed NF-nB activation in UVB-exposed skin and
skin tumors. First, we did immunohistochemical analysis for

phosphorylated p65(Ser276), an activated subunit form of NF-nB. In
control mice receiving normal diet, 4 F 0.6% phosphorylated
p65(Ser276)–positive cells were observed in epidermis, which
increased slightly (nonsignificant) by topical or dietary silibinin
(Fig. 5A). UVB-alone exposure showed 7.5-fold increase (30 F 2%)
in phospho-p65(Ser276)–positive cells which were strongly decreased (by 57–63%) to 11 F 1% (P V 0.001), 13 F 1 (P V 0.001), and
12 F 1% (P V 0.001) after pre-UVB or post-UVB topical or dietary
silibinin treatment, respectively (Fig. 5A). Similarly, skin tumors
from UVB-alone treatment had 41 F 3% phospho-p65(Ser276)–
positive cells, which were lowered by 27% to 34% to 30 F 2% (P V
0.05), 27 F 2% (P V 0.001), and 29 F 4% (P V 0.01) by three silibinin
treatments, respectively (Fig. 5B).
Once again, due to tumor tissue limitation, further studies were
done only in skin samples analyzing phospho-p65(Ser536) and total
p65 levels in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions, as well as NF-nB
activation. It is important to emphasize here is that other than
Ser276, phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 increases its nuclear
translocation (29, 30). UVB-alone exposure strongly increased
phospho-p65(Ser536) level in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions
compared with normal skin (Fig. 5C). All the three modes of
silibinin treatments showed a very strong decrease in phosphop65(Ser536) level in both cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 5C). Silibinin
treatments did not show any considerable effect on total level of
UVB-induced p65 in cytosol but strongly decreased it in the
nucleus (Fig. 5C). Once again, purity of cytosolic and nuclear
fractions was established by using anti–GST-k and histone H1

antibodies, which showed immunoreactivity only for cytosolic and
nuclear specific proteins (Fig. 5C), respectively.
Consistent with increase in both Ser276 and Ser536 phosphorylation of p65, UVB treatment strongly increased NF-nB DNA
binding activity, which was very strongly inhibited by silibinin
treatments (Fig. 5D). Super shift assay indicated presence of both
p65 and p50 subunits of NF-nB in DNA-protein complex (Fig. 5D).
Competition assays with unlabeled NF-nB consensus oligo showing
disappearance of band, and a lack of such effect when unlabeled
mutant NF-nB oligo was used in electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) further established the specificity of DNA-protein
complex (Fig. 5D). Overall, these results indicate that silibinin
strongly inhibits UVB-induced NF-nB signaling in photocarcinogenesis to mediate its photoprotective effects.

Discussion
There are many novel findings in the present study related to
physiologic dose of UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis. Specifically,
physiologically relevant dose (30 mJ/cm2/day) of UVB (a) enhances

dose alters molecular balance toward photocarcinogenesis. Additionally, these molecular changes can be effectively inhibited by
nontoxic chemopreventive agents, like silibinin, to provide
significant protection against photocarcinogenesis. Particularly,
present findings suggest potential clinical benefits of silibinin in
minimizing or preventing photodamage in human skin. Furthermore, almost similar effects of silibinin in topical post-UVB and
dietary treatments versus topical pre-UVB protocol suggest that it
is stable even after UVB irradiation (in pre-UVB application) and
that silibinin primarily works at molecular levels through systemic
distribution rather than as a sunscreen.
This study is different from previous work, in which six times
higher UVB dose (180 mJ/cm2/day) was used, and still we observed
photoprotective effect of silibinin (21). In this regard, the present
study is one-step ahead in identifying molecular alterations in skin
and tumors exposed to a chronic UVB dose which is in the range of
exposure to humans (26). Therefore, silibinin efficacy observed in
the present study in terms of a decrease in tumor number and a
shrinkage of tumor size would have potential clinical significance.
Further, consistent with earlier studies, silibinin did not show any
adverse health effect, which further supports its possible clinical
application.
iNOS produces biological nitric oxide that plays a pivotal role in
UV-induced inflammation and is implicated in the pathogenesis of
various inflammatory diseases, including sunburn and pigmentation, as well as in different stages of tumorigenesis (7, 31). In an
in vivo study, an acute and higher dose of UVB (200 mJ/cm2) is
shown to induce iNOS expression in mouse skin (32). Also, UV is
capable of inducing iNOS expression in keratinocytes (33).
Interestingly, an in vitro study with lower doses of UVB (2 and
5 mJ/cm2) in murine keratinocytes has reported a moderate
suppression in iNOS expression (33). However, in our in vivo study,
chronic exposure of physiologic dose of UVB strongly induced iNOS
expression in mouse skin as well as skin tumors, which is clinically
relevant, as in humans, photosensitivity is shown to be positively
associated with the level of iNOS expression (34, 35). Further,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

silibinin treatments down-regulated UVB-induced iNOS expression
in both skin and tumors which were possibly associated with its
photoprotective effects.
COX-2 is a key enzyme required for prostaglandins syntheses
that mediate inflammatory responses (10). UVB induces COX-2
expression in both mouse and human skin (11–15) and potentially
leads to photocarcinogenesis. However, UVB doses used in previous
studies are considerably higher than that of human exposure.
Recent studies also indicate a link between iNOS and COX-2
expression (36). A study using a single exposure of physiologic dose
of UVB to cultured human keratinocytes has shown up-regulation
of COX-2 expression (11). Consistent with these reports, our study
with the same UVB dose showed increased COX-2 levels in both
skin and skin tumor in hairless mice. Silibinin treatments
substantially lowered COX-2 protein levels in both chronically
exposed skin and skin tumors. Together, these findings suggest that
chronic physiologic dose of UVB induces iNOS and COX-2 to
mediate inflammatory and related processes in vivo and that
topical or dietary silibinin treatment could effectively suppress
them.
Because chronic inflammation is linked to enhanced cell
proliferation and angiogenesis, our next focus was to assess the
molecular markers associated with these biological processes. For
proliferation status, the results showing higher number of PCNAstained cells in both skin and skin tumors by UVB, and their lower
number with silibinin treatments, further substantiate our above
assumption. A similar result was obtained for cyclin D1 expression,
another marker of cell proliferation (data not shown). Consistent
with proliferation data, PECAM-1 analysis, an endothelial cell
marker, showed a similar increasing trend in angiogenic response
by physiologic dose of UVB which was decreased by silibinin
treatments. VEGF is a potent mitogen for endothelial cells and is
also secreted by chronically UVB-exposed skin epithelial or tumor
cells for neoangiogenesis (6, 37). Our results for VEGF were in
accord with PECAM-1 data which further support angiogenic role
of chronic exposure of UVB in both skin and skin tumors. For the

first time, we also observed in vivo effect of UVB on HIF-1a
induction in both tissues. HIF-1a transcriptionally activates VEGF
and plays a crucial role in pathophysiologic angiogenesis (38). It is
well established that overexpression of HIF-1a occurs in many
human cancers (39, 40), and that targeting HIF-1a in tumor cells
inhibits tumor growth (41, 42). Consistent with this, a possible HIF1a–mediated up-regulation of VEGF by UVB was observed in our
experimental conditions, which was targeted by silibinin. This
in vivo observation is supported by a recent report in which UVB is
shown to induce the expression of HIF-1a and VEGF in human
keratinocytes in cell culture (43).
A critical role of STAT3 in promoting tumor cell survival,
proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune evasion has
been shown in various pathophysiologic conditions, including
carcinogenesis (44). However, to our knowledge, there is only one
report with UVB in skin wherein authors have shown that a singleexposure of 180 mJ/cm2 UVB dose increases Tyr705 phosphorylation and total protein level of STAT3 in hairless mouse skin (45). In
our study, chronic physiologic dose of UVB showed similar effect
on Tyr705 phosphorylation and total level of SATA3 in both skin and

skin tumors; additionally, we also observed an increased nuclear
translocation of STAT3 indicative of its potentially enhanced
transcriptional activity. More importantly, UVB-induced activation
of STAT3 was almost completely blocked by silibinin treatments.
These findings imply that indeed STAT3 is a novel potential target
for the prevention of photodamage as well as photocarcinogenesis.
NF-nB is a transcription factor with diverse activities linked to
growth promoting potential and antiapoptotic responses of cells to
a broad spectrum of stimuli that may result in malignant
transformation of cells acquiring drug resistance and metastatic
potential (46). Regarding photocarcinogenesis, there are some
studies, mostly in vitro in keratinocytes, showing activation of
NF-nB by UVB; however, there is no such animal study using the
physiologically relevant dose of UVB to examine its effect on
NF-nB. Therefore, our finding showing activation of NF-nB by UVB
suggests that it could be a clinically relevant target to protect from
photodamage and photocarcinogenesis. Further, this hypothesis is
supported by the inhibitory effect of silibinin on NF-nB signaling in
the same (preclinical) experimental design, which was associated
with its protective effects against UVB.

The inhibitory effects of silibinin on intermediates of angiogenic
and proinflammatory signaling pathways, including HIF-1a,
STAT3, and NF-nB transcription factors suggest that silibinin
possibly targets cytokine and/or oxidative stress-induced activation
of receptor/nonreceptor signaling cascade after UVB irradiation of
mice or cells in culture. In this regard, we have shown that silibinin
strongly inhibits UVB-induced and chemical tumor promoters–
induced oxidative stress, activation of both mitogen-activated
protein kinases and AKT signaling, and skin inflammation in
mouse skin models (25). In addition, our cell culture studies
suggest that silibinin inhibits UVB-induced NF-nB activation
in mouse keratinocyte JB6 cells (47), tumor necrosis factor a
(TNF-a)–induced NF-nB activation in prostate cancer cells (48)
and cytokines mixture (IL-1h + IFNg + TNF-a)–induced proinflammatory events in lung carcinoma A549 cells (49). Therefore, it
is likely that as an upstream target, silibinin interferes with UVBcaused activation of receptor/nonreceptor signaling cascade to
subsequently inhibit the activation of proinflammatory and
angiogenic intermediate signaling molecules. More studies are
needed in the future to further substantiate this assumption and to
identify upstream targets of silibinin in photocarcinogenesis.
In summary, we have identified iNOS, COX-2, and VEGF as
potential molecules in the regulation of inflammation and
angiogenesis at physiologically relevant doses of UVB causing

photocarcinogenesis. In this clinically relevant experimental
condition, we also identified three transcription factors, HIF-1a,
STAT3, and NF-nB, which could potentially up-regulate iNOS,
COX-2, and VEGF in response to UVB. More importantly, silibinin
was found to inhibit these UVB-induced molecular alterations
together with a strong photoprotective effect. Whereas these
results establish correlations between inhibitory effects of silibinin
on inflammatory and angiogenic attributes as they associate to its
protective effect against photocarcinogenesis, future studies are
needed to define specific role of each identified transcription factor
in photoprotective efficacy of silibinin involving down-regulation of
inflammatory and angiogenic molecules. Lastly, it is important to
emphasize here that silibinin is physiologically achievable up to
165 Amol/L in mouse plasma (50) and is already in clinical trial for
prostate cancer (48), and therefore, based on the findings of the
present study; its clinical trial for photoprotective effects in
humans is also warranted.
