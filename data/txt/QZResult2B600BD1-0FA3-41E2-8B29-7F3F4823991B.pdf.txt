ABSTRACT
Cancer therapies that simultaneously target activated mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) and cell metabolism are urgently needed. The goal of our study
was to identify therapies that effectively inhibited both mTOR activity and cancer cell
metabolism in primary tumors in vivo. Using our mouse model of spontaneous breast
cancer promoted by loss of LKB1 expression in an ErbB2 activated model; referred
to as LKB1-/-NIC mice, we evaluated the effect of novel therapies in vivo on primary
tumors. Treatment of LKB1-/-NIC mice with AZD8055 and 2-DG mono-therapies
significantly reduced mammary gland tumorigenesis by inhibiting mTOR pathways
and glycolytic metabolism; however simultaneous inhibition of these pathways with
AZD8055/2-DG combination was significantly more effective at reducing tumor
volume and burden. At the molecular level, combination treatment inhibited mTORC1/
mTORC2 activity, selectively inhibited mitochondria function and blocked MAPK prosurvival signaling responsible for the ERK-p90RSK feedback loop. Our findings suggest
that loss of LKB1 expression be considered a marker for metabolic dysfunction given
its role in regulating AMPK and mTOR function. Finally, the outcome of our pre-clinical
study confirms therapies that simultaneously target mTORC1/mTORC2 and glycolytic
metabolism in cancer produce the best therapeutic outcome for the treatment of
patients harboring metabolically active HER2 positive breast cancers.

INTRODUCTION

however, in cancers that are mutant for LKB1 [3], AMPKmediated regulation of mTOR will be compromised. As
such, the metabolic branch of mTOR signaling, mTORC1,
will be hyperactive, particularly if there are associated
activating mutations in oncogenes. Because hyperactive
mTOR is often found in cancer associated with activating
mutation in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, significant
effort has been made to develop therapeutic strategies
that target PI3K/AKT signaling for the treatment of
cancer. Current treatment strategies are at various stages
of clinical trial, specifically NVP-BEZ235, PF-04691502
and BKM120 [4-6]. These new compounds are promising
however there may be limitations as these drugs are highly
dependent on tumor sub-type, are specific to particular
genetic alterations, and may lead to the activation of

The metabolic branch of mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is primarily dependent
on the energy sensing 5’ AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) and is under-utilized as a strategy to target
aberrant mTOR signaling. The main activator of AMPK
is the serine-threonine tumor suppressor kinase LKB1,
which is responsible for phosphorylating AMPK on
Thr172, leading to the activation of the energy sensor
[1, 2]. Both somatic and sporadic mutations have been
identified in LKB1 and are responsible for numerous
malignancies [3]. Arguably, targeting activating mutations
in the phosphoinoside-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway
have proven to be a viable strategy for inhibiting mTOR,

negative feedback loops that acerbate resistance or
recurrence. By exclusively targeting activating mutations
in the PI3K/AKT branch of mTOR signaling, it stands
to reason that if these same cancers express mutation in
LKB1 or express isoforms of the pseudokinase STRADα
that render LKB1 catalytically deficient [7], the tumors
may initially regress in response to treatment, however
because AMPK activity is deregulated and the mTORC1MAPK feedback loop is activated [8], the cancer will
invariably return and/or be resistant to future treatments.
Recently we discovered that 31% of HER2 positive
breast cancer lacked expression of LKB1 [9]. Based on this
discovery we developed a mouse model of breast cancer
where an activating mutation in the ErbB2 oncogene
was combined with loss of LKB1 expression (LKB1-/NIC mice) [9]. In this model, we observed that loss of
LKB1 activity promoted tumor growth by significantly
reducing the latency of ErbB2-mediated tumorigenesis.
Furthermore, tumorigenesis was strongly associated
with hyperactivation of mTOR and dysregulation of cell
metabolism, giving rise to metabolically active tumors.
We found that inhibition of mTOR with AZD8055, a
novel ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTOR that inhibits
both mTORC1 and mTORC2 [10], inhibited mTOR
signaling and expression of glycolytic enzymes, lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase
(PDH), in primary breast cancer cells isolated from LKB1/NIC mice [9]. Further to this, we and others observed
a reduction in LDH expression and therefore lactate, in
response to inhibition of mTOR by Rapamycin [11, 12].
It is clear that alternative treatment strategies
are necessary to overcome hyperactivated mTOR and
dysregulation of cell metabolism attributed to the loss
of LKB1 regulation of AMPK signaling pathways.
Given that aerobic glycolysis plays a significant role in
tumorigenesis, targeted regulation of ATP production
may present as a viable option for the treatment of cancer.
2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) inhibits a rate-limiting step in
glycolysis as it is taken up by the cell and metabolized
by hexokinase to phospho-2-DG (p-2-DG), a competitive
inhibitor of hexokinase [13, 14]. As a mono-therapy,
2-DG-mediated growth suppression appears to be
offset by a concomitant induction of AKT activation
through phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 [15]. We
conducted pre-clinical trials to investigate novel monotherapies and combinatorial therapies that targeted mTOR
and metabolism in mammary gland tumorigenesis. In
our study, we specifically evaluated inhibition of both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 with AZD8055 in combination
with the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG, in LKB1-/-NIC mice
with aggressive primary breast cancer [9]. Using magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), we monitored changes in tumor
growth in response to treatments and elucidated the role
metabolism plays in our model. Herein we confirm that
targeted combinatorial therapy that simultaneously inhibits
mTOR signaling and glycolytic metabolism is a viable

strategy for the treatment of aggressive primary breast
cancer.

RESULTS
Loss of LKB1

enhances

cell

We previously observed that ATP levels in LKB1NIC primary mammary tumor cells were elevated
compared to the level of ATP in wild-type mammary
epithelial cells, as were other important metabolites
quantified from whole tumors [9]. To determine whether
loss of LKB1 expression is responsible for enhanced
breast cancer cell metabolism, we analyzed the presence
of metabolites in whole LKB1-/-NIC mammary tumors
compared to tumors harvested from NIC control mice
and from wild-type (WT) mammary glands by NMR
analysis (Chenomx Inc.) (Fig.1). Normally, when
cellular AMP levels are elevated, the binding of AMP
to a AMPK enhances the substrate readiness of AMPK
for phosphorylation/activation by the LKB1 complex,
resulting in inhibition of mTOR signaling and fat synthesis
[16, 17]. Thus, AMPK serves as a metabolic switch that
senses the energy requirements of the cell. Metabolic
analysis of AMP concentrations in LKB1-/-NIC tumors
(0.001 ± 0.00 µM/mg), NIC tumors (0.13 ± 0.05 µM/mg)
and WT (0.59 ± 0.14 µM/mg) mammary tissues indicate
that AMP concentrations are significantly reduced in
mammary tumors compared to WT tissue (P<0.05).
Under these circumstances, AMPK activity in LKB1/NIC tumors would be compromised on two counts;
loss of LKB1 activity and reduced AMP concentrations,
whereas in NIC mice, AMPK activity would be less
impacted since NIC tumors express LKB1 comparable to
WT mammary tissues [9]. As a result, regulation of mTOR
in LKB1-/-NIC mice is increased, as is the regulation of
metabolic pathways. Of the biosynthetic metabolites that
are necessary for the maintenance of cell metabolism and
mitochondria function, acetate is used in cells as part of
acetyl-CoA group and is the first molecule to enter the
Krebs cycle. Acetate concentrations in LKB1-/-NIC tumors
(0.73 ± 0.03 µM/mg), was significantly elevated compared
to the concentration in NIC tumors or WT mammary
tissue (0.22 ± 0.07 and 0.22 ± 0.01 µM/mg, respectively;
P˂0.05). The amino acids isoleucine and alanine are direct
sources of ions for cell metabolism, as they are found in
mitochondria and are precursors for the synthesis of key
elements of the Krebs cycle and metabolic pathways. In
LKB1-/-NIC tumors, isoleucine (0.44 ± 0.02 µM/mg) was
significantly elevated compared to levels in NIC and WT
gland (0.31 ± 0.03 and 0.21 ± 0.02 µM/mg, respectively;
P˂0.05). Alanine levels were modestly elevated in LKB1/NIC (3.84 ± 0.41 µM/mg) tumors compared to NIC

(2.71 ± 0.23 µM/mg) and WT (3.13 ± 0.42 µM/mg),
however the differences were not statistically significant.
Taurine plays a role in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
pathways, with low levels of taurine implicated in a variety
of metabolic diseases [18, 19]. In LKB1-/-NIC tumors, we
observed a significant reduction in taurine (2.66 ± 0.31
µM/mg) concentration compared to NIC and WT gland
(4.68 ± 0.13 and 7.23 ± 0.38 µM/mg, respectively; P˂0.1).
Niacinamide is incorporated into NAD coenzyme and is
involved in a variety of mitochondria enzymatic reactions.
In our model, niacinamide was significantly elevated in
LKB1-/-NIC tumors (0.57 ± 0.007 µM/mg) compared
to NIC and WT tissues (0.38 ± 0.05 µM/mg and 0.41 ±
0.03 µM/mg, respectively; P˂0.05) (Fig. 1). These results
suggest that the loss of LKB1 promotes ErbB2-mediated
mammary tumorigenesis, in part, through metabolic
processes since analysis of NIC tumors displayed less
metabolic activity than tumors from LKB1-/-NIC.

we were interested in whether treatment of LKB1-/NIC mice in vivo with compounds that target the PI3K
pathway and mTOR would be effective at inhibiting
tumor growth. LKB1-/-NIC mice at 20 weeks [9] received
daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration for 21 days
and tumor volume was determined weekly using caliper
measurements. We observed that mice treated with NVPBEZ235 (10mg kg-1) resulted in a significant reduction in
tumor growth (22.58 ± 10.65, n=3 mean ± SD, P<0.01)
by day 21 of treatment, compared with Vehicle treated
mice (40.19 ± 6.97, n=3 mean ± SD) (Fig. 2A, B). We
treated mice with the mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 (20mg
kg-1) and found that inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2
significantly inhibited tumor growth (4.72 ± 1.19, n=3
mean ± SD, P<0.001) compared with Vehicle treated mice
(Fig. 2A, B). Further to this, tumor volume in response to
AZD8055 treatment was significantly reduced compared
with tumor volume in response to NVP-BEZ235 treatment
(P<0.01) (Fig. 2A, B). Tumor volume in response to
treatments was similar up to day 14, after which there
was a significant impairment in tumor growth in response
to AZD8055 treatment compared with Vehicle treatment
(2.5 ±0.9 and 19.29 ±12.8, n=3 mean ± SD, P˂0.01
respectively) (Fig. 2A).

was significantly decreased in response to both AZD8055
treatment alone (172 ± 5.2 mpH/min) and NVP-BEZ235

Vehicle- treated cells (Fig. 2C). In the same experiments,
oxygen consumption levels were found to be decreased in
response to mono- and combination therapies, indicative
of decreased metabolic function (Fig. 2D). Collectively,
this data suggests that both AZD8055 and NVP-BEZ235
mono-therapy decreased tumor growth in LKB1-/-NIC
mice, however the inhibition of mTOR by AZD8055 was
significantly more effective at preventing tumor growth
compared with NVP-BEZ235 treatment alone. Given that

Previously, we showed that treatment of primary
breast cancer cells isolated from LKB1-/-NIC mice with
AZD8055 significantly inhibited mTORC1/mTORC2,
as well as inhibition of glycolytic enzymes identified as
drivers of the Warburg effect [9]. To determine whether
mitochondria function is altered in our model, we treated
LKB1-/-NIC primary breast cancer cells using AZD8055
(100 nM) alone, NVP-BEZ235 (100 nM) alone and
combination AZD8055/NVP-BEZ235 (100 nM/100

NVP-BEZ235 is a poor inhibitor of AKT and PDK1 [20,

evaluated whether it was feasible to simultaneously inhibit
glycolysis and mTOR activity in LKB1-/-NIC mammary
tumors by treating mice daily for 21 days with low dose
2-DG (25 mgkg-1) alone, AZD8055 (20 mgkg-1) alone and
2-DG plus AZD8055 (25mgkg-1 plus 20 mgkg-1). For these
longitudinal studies, mice were pre-screened by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) at 19 weeks of age to identify
early tumor bearing mice, after which treatments were
initiated at week 20 with daily injections (i.p) for 21 days.
Treatment duration was determined by ethical endpoint
tumor burden of 10% body weight. Treatments were well
tolerated by the mice for the duration of the study and no
variation in weight gain was observed. Tumor volume was
measured by MRI every seven days with representative
mice shown at Day 0 and Day 21 for each treatment (Fig.

primary mammary tumor cells with AZD8055 inhibited
key glycolytic enzymes, namely PDH and LDH, we
wanted to explore beyond our previous ex vivo findings

3A). We did not observe any differences in tumor volume
after treatment for seven days (Fig. 3B); however by
14 days of treatment, tumor volumes were significantly
reduced in response to AZD8055 alone and in combination
treatment, compared with treatment with 2-DG alone or
Vehicle. Compared with Day 0, Vehicle treatment for
21 days resulted in an increase in tumor volume by 42.3
±10.4 fold, whereas both AZD8055 alone and 2-DG alone
significantly inhibited tumor growth by Day 21, compared
with Day 0 (3.7 ± 1.6 and 14.1 ± 2.4 fold, respectively)
(Fig 3A-B). Compared with start of treatment, the
combination of AZD8055 + 2-DG significantly decreased
tumor volume (0.85 ± 0.4 fold) by Day 21 compared with
Vehicle (42.3 ±10.4 fold), 2-DG treatments (14.1 ± 2.4
fold) and AZD8055 (3.7 ± 1.6 fold) mono-therapies (Fig
3. A-B). Tumors were harvested at the end of 21 days
and in agreement with MRI volumetric analysis, tumors
were consistently smaller from combination treated mice
compared to mono-therapies and Vehicle treatments (Fig.
3C). Furthermore, tumor burden in response to treatment
was significantly different between 2-DG treated mice
and those treated with AZD8055 alone or combination
treatment (Fig. 3D).

2-DG as mono-therapies or in combination are well
tolerated by mitochondria, as not altering mitochondria
biogenesis of normal cells. Furthermore, these results
suggest that loss of LKB1 signaling in breast cancer
reduces the ability of cells to overcome metabolic stress;
however, treatments that target aberrant glycolysis and
mTOR signaling drive the cells to overcome metabolic
stress, ultimately resulting in decreased tumourigenesis,
as observed in our pre-clinical study (Fig. 3).
Given that we observed a shift in mitochondria
content in response to AZD8055 alone, 2-DG alone and
combinatorial therapy, we investigated whether there
were corresponding changes in mitochondria function
that would challenge the energy requirements for rapidly
growing tumors. We investigated the capacity of LKB1-/NIC primary mammary tumor cells for aerobic glycolysis
(ECAR), and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in response
to treatments. Using the Seahorse XF analyzer, we treated
LKB1-/-NIC primary mammary tumor cells using 2-DG,
AZD8055 and combination of both. We observed that
treatment of cells with 2-DG alone (160.0 ± 1.5 mpH/min),
AZD8055 alone (169 ± 17.9 mpH/min) and combination
treatment (200.7 ± 26 mpH/min) significantly inhibited
ECAR levels compared to Vehicle treatment (281.3 ±
13.8 mpH/min; P<0.05) (Fig. 5A). Treatment of cells with
AZD8055 alone or combinatorial treatment significantly
reduced OCR compared with 2-DG treatment alone
(Fig. 5B). This data strongly supports that combination
treatment of AZD8055/2-DG reduces mitochondria
function and aerobic glycolysis in LKB1-/-NIC mammary
tumor cells.
As tumors develop, faulty metabolic switches
allow for growth advantages over normal cells. mTOR
enhances transcription of glycolytic enzymes, thereby
increasing the capacity of glycolysis metabolism [23-25].
Thus, the inhibition of mTOR would be a strategy for
controlling glycolytic metabolic switches. Further to this,
the inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme hexokinase 2
(HEX2) could augment the effects of mTOR inhibition.
To explore whether mono- or combination therapies
altered the expression of glycolytic enzymes in LKB1-/NIC mammary tumors, we analyzed expression of HEX2,
LDH and PDH in whole tumors harvested from mice
that had been treated with AZD8055, 2-DG, combination
treatment and Vehicle for 21 days (Fig. 5C), by western
blot analysis. AZD8055 treatment of LKB1-/-NIC mice
modestly reduced expression of HEX2 compared with
2-DG treatment in vivo however; combination therapy
exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on HEX2
expression. LDH expression was reduced only in
response to combination therapy, compared with monotherapies, while all treatments inhibited expression of
PDH compared with Vehicle treatment (Fig. 5C). These
results suggest that treatment of LKB1-/-NIC mice with
AZD8055 in combination with 2-DG, leads to molecular
changes in metabolic switches that contribute to inhibition

Mitochondria content shifts in response to
AZD8055 and 2-DG
To determine whether there was a difference in
mitochondria function between LKB1-/-NIC primary
mammary tumor cells and WT mammary epithelial cells,
we measured mitochondria content in LKB1-/-NIC and
WT cells using mitotracker red CMX/ROS (Fig. 4A).
We observed that LKB1-/-NIC primary mammary tumor
cells had greater mitochondria content than WT mammary
epithelial cells. In addition, we analyzed mitochondria
morphology by transmission electron microscopy
and fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 4B) and found that
morphologically, mitochondria in LKB1-/-NIC cells were
enlarged with increased cristae density compared to
mitochondria in WT mammary epithelial cells, suggestive
of increased ATP-production capacity.
To determine the effect of inhibiting mTOR and/
or glycolysis on mitochondria content, we treated cells
with AZD8055, 2-DG and AZD8055 + 2-DG for 2 hours,
followed by analysis of mitochondria metabolic activity. In
LKB1-/-NIC cells, both mono- and combination therapies
resulted in a shift in mitochondria content to the left;
indicative of reduced mitochondria content, compared with
Vehicle-treated LKB1-/-NIC cells (Fig. 4C). In response to
combination treatment, we consistently observed a greater
reduction in mitochondria content compared with monotherapies. For WT mammary epithelial cells, we did not
observe any difference in mitochondria content between
mono-therapies, combination therapy, or Vehicle treatment
(Fig. 4D). These results suggest that both AZD8055 and

of tumourigenesis (Fig. 3).
Previous work by others has shown that prolonged
inhibition of either PI3K or mTOR by drugs or by genetic
means, leads to activation of a negative feedback loop
that activate MAPK signaling [8, 26, 27]. As such, we
examined the effect of mono-therapies and combination
therapy on the expression of both AMPK and MAPK
signaling pathways in whole mammary tumors from
LKB1-/-NIC mice by western blot analysis (Fig. 5D).

In response to AZD8055 treatment for 21 days, tumor
volume and burden were significantly reduced (Fig.
3), while the expression of pACC, the direct target of
AMPK, and pAMPK were elevated, and expression
of pS6, the target of S6 kinase, was markedly reduced,
compared with other treatments. As expected [8, 26, 27],
the phosphorylation status of p90RSK and ERK were
elevated in response to prolonged inhibition of mTOR
by AZD8055, compared with other treatments (Fig. 5D).

Given that 2-DG is a known activator of pro-survival
pathways via PI3K and insulin-like growth factor receptor
1 [14, 28], in our model, both tumor volume and burden
were significantly reduced, compared with Vehicle
treatment (Fig. 3), however the phosphorylation status
of S6, ACC and AMPK were unchanged from Vehicletreated mice. The phosphorylation status of p90RSK and
ERK was also unchanged compared to Vehicle-treated
(Fig. 5D). Finally, treatment of LKB1-/-NIC mice for 21
days with combination therapy showed the greatest impact
on tumor volume and burden (Fig 3) with no change in

the phosphorylation status of S6 compared with 2-DG
treatment alone and Vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5D).
Interestingly, the phosphorylation status of ERK and
RSK were unchanged in Vehicle-treated mice despite the
increase observed in response to AZD8055 mono-therapy.
These results suggest that the simultaneous inhibition of
mTORC1/mTORC2 and glycolytic pathways prevents
the mTORC1 negative feedback loop and likely enhances
both AZD8055- and 2-DG-mediated growth inhibition
since activation of the MAPK pathway is prevented.

DISCUSSION

Therapies that activate the AMPK signaling pathway
such as the biguanides metformin and phenformin have
been used for the treatment of diabetes. Given the role
these compounds play in regulated glycolytic metabolism
as well as mitochondria function [34, 35], clinical trials
are underway for the treatment of cancer, highlighting
the importance of targeting cancer cell metabolism in
metabolically active diseases. Since aerobic glycolysis
is a major source of energy and provides biosynthetic
products for protein and lipid synthesis, targeted inhibition
of glycolysis would ultimately impact tumor growth.
Inhibition of the rate-limiting step in glycolysis with 2-DG
leads to depletion of ATP [13, 14], potentially shifting
the Warburg Effect [36]. Results from Phase II clinical
trials using 2-DG for the treatment of osteosarcomas and
lung cancer, suggest that mono-therapy with 2-DG may
not be as promising as combinatorial therapy, however
in combination with other targeted treatments such as
paclitaxel, inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG sensitized
tumors to the chemotherapeutic agents [28]. In another
study, treatment of LNCaP prostate cancer cells with 2-DG
in combination with the AMPK activator metformin,
resulted in activation of pro-death pathways in vitro
inducing p53-dependent apoptosis via the energy sensor
pathway AMPK [37].
In our study, treatment of LKB1-/-NIC mice that
are hyperactive for mTOR and metabolically active (Fig.
6A) with 2-DG mono-therapy (Fig. 3 and 6B) inhibited
tumorigenesis, such that both tumor volume and burden
were reduced in response to reduced aerobic glycolysis and
mitochondria function, however AZD8055 mono-therapy
(Fig. 3 and 6C) was significantly better at inhibiting
tumor volume, burden and mitochondrial function. A
possible explanation as to why 2-DG underperforms
may be due to concomitant induction of AKT thereby
activating pro-survival pathways [14, 38, 39]. With this
in mind, prolonged treatment of LKB1-/-NIC mice with
AZD8055 alone or 2-DG alone have challenges, in that
both mono-therapies lead to enhanced activity of prosurvival pathways. However combining both AZD8055
and 2-DG treatment for 21 days synergized treatment
effects, overriding pro-survival pathways, with the
greatest effect on tumor volume, burden and mitochondria
function. Thus, targeted treatment of hyperactive mTOR
and aberrant glycolysis with combination therapy,
AZD8055/2-DG inhibited the activation of ERKmediated survival pathways associated with prolonged
inhibition of mTOR [8, 40], as well as activation of AKT
associated with 2-DG treatment [14, 38, 39] (Fig.3 and
6D). Interestingly, we observed phosphorylation of S6 in
response to 2-DG monotherapy and combination therapy
(Fig. 5C), despite inhibition of pro- survival pathways. A
possible explanation for this could be that loss of LKB1
expression and therefore catalytic function, may contribute
to the phosphorylation of S6 under an energy depletion
state. Our findings are in agreement with work by others

In the present study we evaluated the effect of
mono-therapies and combination therapy on spontaneous
primary mammary tumors from LKB1-/-NIC mice that
we previously characterized as hyperactive for mTOR
and enhanced metabolic activities promoted by the loss
of LKB1 expression and gain of ErbB2 function [9]. Our
LKB1-/-NIC mouse model is representative of spontaneous
primary human breast cancers that are HER2 positive with
deregulated metabolic activity. Initial characterization ex
vivo of primary mammary tumor cells confirmed that
inhibition of mTOR by AZD8055 significantly reduced
AKT, mTORC1/mTORC2 and glycolytic activities
[9]. Pre-clinical longitudinal studies that targeted the
PI3K and p70S6K pathways with competitive NVPBEZ235 inhibitor was not as effective at reducing tumor
volume and burden as targeting mTOR with AZD8055
or glycolysis with 2-DG mono-therapies. A plausible
explanation for this difference may be attributed to the fact
that NVP-BEZ235 is a poor inhibitor of AKT and PDK1
[20, 21], whereas AZD8055 inhibition of mTOR prevents
the activation of both AKT-T308 and AKT-S473 [9]. Thus
in our model, AZD8055 is a better treatment.
Recently, LKB1 inactivation has been shown to
cooperate with activating oncogene mutations to drive
tumor progression in various models of cancer [9, 26,
29, 30]. The primary substrate of LKB1 is the central
regulator of energy homeostasis and metabolic checkpoint,
AMPK. At the nexus between growth factor receptor
signaling and cellular energy metabolism, AMPK when
activated regulates protein and lipid synthesis, inhibits
mTORC1 through activation of tuberous sclerosis
complex 2 (TSC2) and phosphorylation of raptor [1,
31-33]. When LKB1-AMPK signaling is functional,
regulation of the metabolic branch of mTOR signaling
is intact regardless of whether PI3K/AKT or receptor
tyrosine kinase signaling is aberrant. In our LKB1-/NIC mouse model of primary breast cancer, LKB1AMPK signaling is significantly compromised, thus
mono-therapy with the dual ATP-competitive PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 was insufficient to block
tumorigenesis whereas the combination of NVP-BEZ235
and AZD8055 resulted in reduced mitochondria function
comparable to AZD8055 mono-therapy alone. Unlike
NVP-BEZ235, AZD8055 inhibits phosphorylation of
mTORC1 and mTORC2 substrates, namely p70S6K and
4E-BP1, leading to significant inhibition of cap-dependent
translation, and phosphorylation of AKT at residues S473/
T308, respectively [9, 10]. Our pre-clinical data strongly
suggest that treatment with AZD8055 as a mono-therapy is
sufficient to inhibit primary mammary gland tumorigenesis
in LKB1-/-NIC mice, however the negative feedback loop
that leads to the activation of MAPK signaling [8, 26,
27] could lead to relapse. Thus, a novel combinatorial
approach that targets metabolic processes is warranted.

that evaluated 2-DG treatment of non-small cell lung
cancer cells (NSCLC) that lacked expression of LKB1
compared to NSCLC cells that express LKB1 [41]. In
this study, treatment of cells that lacked the expression
of LKB1, with 2-DG, did not reduce the phosphorylation
status of S6 compared to the phosphorylation status
of S6 in cells that express LKB1 [41]. It is also known
that phosphorylation of TSC2 by AMPK is required for
translation regulation and S6 phosphorylation events
[42] and more recently, it has been shown that activated
AMPK is necessary for 2-DG mediated inhibition of pS6

[43]. Therefore the loss of LKB1 expression leads to
loss of AMPK activation and impaired AMPK-mediated
activation of TSC2 in response to energy deprivation
caused by 2-DG treatment, emphasizing the importance
of LKB1 in the regulation of energy homeostasis.
Mitochondria content was significantly reduced in

mammary tumor cells, compared with mitochondria

model of primary breast cancer leads to hyperactivation of mTOR and enhanced cancer cell metabolism. (B) Cell signaling in LKB1-/NIC mammary gland tumors in response to 2-DG treatment. Schematic shows inhibition of aerobic glycolysis leading to decreased cell

mTOR remains hyperactive. (C) Cell signaling in LKB1-/-NIC mammary gland tumors in response to AZD8055 treatment. Schematic
shows inhibition of mTOR signaling thereby preventing phosphorylation of S6K, inhibition of cell proliferation and a decrease in aerobic

pro-survival pathways. (D) Cell signaling in LKB1-/-NIC mammary gland tumors in response to combination treatment with AZD8055/2DG. Schematic shows simultaneous inhibition of mTOR and aerobic glycolysis. In this model, glucose enters the cell but is not completely
metabolized in response to 2-DG treatment. As such, pro- survival pathways that would be activated in response to prolonged inhibition
of mTOR by AZD8055 treatment are suppressed via IRS1 signaling. The simultaneous inhibition of aberrant mTOR signaling and cell
metabolism by AZD8055 and 2-DG leads to a significant reduction in tumor growth, burden and aberrant signaling pathways.

biogenesis, cells lacking the LKB1-AMPK pathway would
be more sensitive to treatment with these compounds as
mono-therapies and/or in combination, while mitochondria
content remains intact in WT mammary epithelial
cells. These results suggest that AZD8055 and/or 2-DG
compounds would not be detrimental to mitochondria
function in normal cells when administered systemically.
In conclusion, we conducted pre-clinical trials
using our LKB1-/-NIC mice to test mono-therapies and
combinatorial therapies that targeted mTORC1/mTORC2
and metabolism in primary tumors. We discovered that
treatment of mice with AZD8055 or 2-DG as monotherapies was more effective at inhibiting mammary
gland tumorigenesis than targeting PI3K pathways with
competitive NVP-BEZ235 inhibitor. We also demonstrate
that metabolically active cancer cells are more susceptible
to the effects of metabolic drugs then normal mammary
epithelial cells. We discovered that simultaneous
inhibition of mTOR and metabolism with AZD8055 plus
2-DG combination was significantly more effective at
inhibiting tumorigenesis and preventing sustained tumor
growth that would occur through the activation of MAPK
survival pathways. The outcome of our pre-clinical study
emphasizes that mono-therapies directed towards ErbB2/
HER2, PI3K or hyperactive mTOR alone, may not be
adequate and sufficient to cause complete regression of
primary tumors and/or prevent resistant phenotypes from
developing. Our discovery strongly supports the practice
of evaluation of LKB1 expression in tumors as a marker
for aberrant mTOR and metabolic signaling. Furthermore,
our model of primary breast cancer can be used as a tool
to study the effectiveness of novel mono-therapies and
combination therapies that are directed towards cancer
that are hyperactive for mTOR and aberrant cancer
metabolism. Future studies could take into consideration
the role hyperactive mTOR and metabolism play in
metastatic disease, and how best to treat this more lethal
form of breast cancer and whether cell autonomous
mechanisms are involved. As such, combination therapies
that simultaneously target these pathways will provide the
best clinical outcome for the treatment of metabolically
active breast cancer.

Primary tumors and cells
Primary mammary tumors, primary mammary
tumor cells and primary mammary epithelial cells were
harvested from LKB1-/-/NIC and wild-type control
mice as previously described [9]. Primary mammary
epithelial cells were harvested and immediately used for
experimentation.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRI images were acquired using a 3T Agilent
MRI system specifically optimized for pre-clinical
imaging, using a 21cm Magnex gradient coil and 25mm
quadrature RF coil from Doty Scientific. MRI acquisitions
involved 150 micron isotropic resolution 3D balancedSSFP optimized for fat-tumor contrast. Volumetric
tumor estimates were obtained through ellipsoidal model
estimates in 3-plane orthogonal views using Agilent’s
VNMRJ package to measure tumor extent in each of
3 orthogonal directions. 3D rendered tumor volume
calculations were performed using the RView software.

Kinase Inhibitors
AZD8055 and NVP-BEZ235 were from Selleck,
Chemicals. AZD8055 and NVP-BEV235 treatment
protocols were based on previous drug studies conducted
in the LKB1 conditional mice [26, 32, 44, 45]. 2-DG was
from Toronto Research Chemicals. 2-DG treatments were
based on studies conducted in various conditional mouse
models [28, 46, 47].

Western blot analysis
Following drug treatments, mammary tissues from
wild-type animals and tumors from LKB1-/-NIC mice were
harvested and protein lysates were prepared as previously
described [9, 48]. The following antibodies were used:
phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (pS6)(S235/236), -ACC,
-pACC (S79), -pAMPK (T172), –AMPK, -pERK (T202/
Y204), -ERK and antibodies against glycolytic proteins
(all from Cell Signaling), -phospho-p90RSK (S380) and
–p90RSK (Abcam), anti-LKB1 (Ley 37D), actin (Santa
