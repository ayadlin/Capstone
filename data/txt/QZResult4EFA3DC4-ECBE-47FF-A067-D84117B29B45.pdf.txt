Tumors Induced by KRASG12D or BRAFV600E

Abstract
Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of lung tumorigenesis allow careful evaluation of lung tumor
initiation, progression, and response to therapy. Using GEM models of oncogene-induced lung cancer, we show
the striking similarity of the earliest stages of tumorigenesis induced by KRASG12D or BRAFV600E. Cre-mediated
expression of KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the lung epithelium of adult mice initially elicited benign lung tumors
comprising cuboidal epithelial cells expressing markers of alveolar pneumocytes. Strikingly, in a head-to-head
comparison, oncogenic BRAFV600E elicited many more such benign tumors and did so more rapidly than
KRASG12D. However, despite differences in the efﬁciency of benign tumor induction, only mice with lung
epithelium expression of KRASG12D developed malignant non–small cell lung adenocarcinomas. Pharmacologic
inhibition of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)1/2
combined with in vivo imaging showed that initiation and maintenance of both BRAFV600E- or KRASG12D-induced
lung tumors was dependent on MEK!ERK signaling. Although the tumors dramatically regressed in response to
MEK1/2 inhibition, they regrew following cessation of drug treatment. Together, our ﬁndings show that
RAF!MEK!ERK signaling is both necessary and sufﬁcient for KRASG12D-induced benign lung tumorigenesis
in GEM models. The data also emphasize the ability of KRASG12D to promote malignant lung cancer progression
compared with oncogenic BRAFV600E. Cancer Res; 72(12); 3048–59. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in the industrialized world and was responsible for approximately 160,000
deaths in the United States in 2007 (1). Despite its prevalence
and strikingly high mortality rates, the cellular origins of lung
cancer remain obscure and therapeutic approaches to treat the
disease have proven disappointingly ineffective (2). Consequently, the 5-year survival rate for patients with advanced
lung cancer remains low, emphasizing the need for new
therapeutic approaches to treat this disease.
The genetic heterogeneity of lung cancer has been revealed
in more detail and in a manner that has direct implications for
therapy (2, 3). For example, mutational activation of ERBB1,
encoding the EGF receptor (EGFR), predicts for a clinical
response to EGFR inhibitors such as Tarceva (4, 5). Similarly,
lung cancers expressing an oncogenic EML4-ALK fusion protein respond well to crizotinib, an inhibitor of anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK) and MET protein kinases (6). However, lung cancers expressing mutationally activated KRAS do

not respond to either EGFR or ALK inhibitors and, at least with
Tarceva, the use of EGFR inhibitors is contraindicated (7–9).
Mutationally activated KRAS binds to a multiplicity of
effector proteins including (but not limited to) RAF protein
kinases, phosphoinositide 3 (PI3)0 -lipid kinases and RAL-GDS
(10, 11). Consistent with an important role for RAS pathway
signaling in lung cancer, mutational activation of BRAF or
PIK3CA or silencing of PTEN are detected in a small percentage
of lung cancers (12–15). Because mutationally activated KRAS
remains an intractable pharmacologic target, deﬁning relevant
RAS effector pathway(s) in lung cancer is of critical importance
as potent and speciﬁc inhibitors of RAS effector kinases are
being clinically tested for a number of different cancers (11).
Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of KRASG12Dor BRAFV600E-induced lung cancer have been described
(16–19). In particular, mice carrying conditionally activated
alleles of KRas (KRasLSL) or BRaf (BRafCA), in which oncogene
expression is initiated by Cre recombinase at the normal
chromosomal locus, have allowed exploration of the earliest
events following oncogene activation as well as events involved
in cancer progression and metastatic spread (17, 18, 20–22).
Here, we use KRasLSL and BRafCA mice to directly compare the
effects of oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E on benign lung
tumorigenesis, malignant cancer progression, and the importance of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)1/2 signaling in tumor
maintenance. KRASG12D- and BRAFV600E-induced benign lung
tumors share similar morphologic and histologic characteristics and express markers of alveolar pneumocytes but not
Clara cells. Despite the fact that BRAFV600E tumors formed

Lung Tumorigenesis Initiated by Oncogenic KRAS or BRAF

faster and at higher multiplicity, they failed to display malignant progression. In contrast, KRASG12D-induced lung tumors
routinely progressed to higher grade adenocarcinomas. However, both KRASG12D- and BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors
were sensitive to the antitumor effects of MEK1/2 inhibition.
Consistent with this, tumor-derived cell lines were growtharrested in vitro following MEK inhibitor treatment, suggesting
that MEK1/2 inhibition, either alone or in combination chemotherapy, might represent a viable strategy for targeting
KRAS-mutant lung cancers in humans.

Materials and Methods
Mice and adenovirus delivery
All experiments involving mice were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. BRafCA (Braftm1Mmcm), KRasLSL (Krastm4Tyj),
Aqp5/, and LucRep Tg(Actb-GFP-Luc) mice were bred
and genotyped as previously described (17, 18, 23, 24). A
stock of adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre) was
purchased from Viraquest, and intranasal instillation for
infection of the mouse lung epithelium was conducted as
previously described (25). BrdU (Sigma) was administered at
approximately 30 mg/kg by i.p. injection 20 hours before
euthanasia.
Histology and quantiﬁcation of lung tumor burden
Lungs were removed and ﬁxed in zinc-buffered formalin and
stored in 70% (v/v) ethanol before parafﬁn embedding. Fivemicrometer sections were cut and slides were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). H&E-stained slides were
scanned with an Aperio ScanScope scanner. Quantiﬁcation
was carried out using Aperio Spectrum ImageScope viewing
software. Tumor number and size were measured per lung
section, and overall tumor burden was calculated as (area of
lung section occupied by tumor)/(total area of section) in mm2.
Differences in lung tumor grade were based on criteria established by Nikitin and colleagues (26). Statistical signiﬁcance of
differences in lung tumor grade was assessed using the exact
Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
For effects of MEK inhibition on tumor prevention, 10 lung
lobes from 3 vehicle-treated and 13 lung lobes from 4
PD0325901-treated KRasLSL mice were evaluated. For effects
of MEK inhibition on tumor regression, 7 lung lobes from 2
vehicle-treated and 8 lung lobes from 3 PD0325901-treated
KRasLSL mice were evaluated.
Drug treatments and bioluminescent imaging
PD0325901 (Hansun Trading Co.) was formulated in 0.5%
(w/v) (hydroxypropyl)methyl cellulose (HPMT; Sigma) and
administered by oral gavage at 12.5 mg/kg per mouse once
per day for 5 d/wk. Mice carrying the LucRep transgene were
injected with Fireﬂy D-Luciferin (Gold Biotechnology) i.p. and
were imaged 10 minutes later using the Xenogen IVIS 100
Bioluminescent Imaging System. Bioluminescent signal measured in photons/s (p/s) was quantiﬁed using Live Image
software (Caliper Life Sciences).

Immunostaining of mouse lung tissue and
immunoblotting
Mouse lungs were ﬁxed in formaldehyde overnight, processed, embedded in parafﬁn, cut into 5-mm sections, and
mounted on glass slides. Citrate-mediated antigen retrieval was
conducted, and then the following antibodies were used for
detection: anti-SP-C, anti-RAGE, anti-gp38 (Santa Cruz); antiAQP5 (Calbiochem); anti-BrdU (Roche); anti-Ki67 (Abcam);
anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-S6 (Ser235/236; Cell
Signaling Technology).
Cell proliferation was assessed by counting the percentage
of surfactant protein (SP-C)-positive tumor cells that were
also bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)-positive by double label
immunoﬂuorescence. In BRafCA mice, 6 tumors were analyzed
with 9 grids each for a total of 4,112 SP-C–positive cells
evaluated. In KRasLSL mice, 5 tumors were analyzed with 9 grids
each for a total of 2,831 SP-C–positive cells evaluated. Similar
numbers of cells were evaluated for the presence of SP-C/Ki67
double-positive cells in BRAFV600E- versus KRASG12D-induced
lung tumors.
Fifty-microgram aliquots of cell extracts were analyzed by
standard immunoblotting using antisera against the following
proteins: phospho-MEK1/2 (pMEK1/2), phospho-ERK1/2
(pERK1/2), total ERK1/2 (tERK1/2), BIM (Epitomics); cleaved
caspase-3 (CC3; Cell Signaling Technology); and cyclin D1 (Cell
Signaling Technology). Immunoblots were visualized using the
Odyssey Fc System (LI-COR) and ImageStudio Software.
Electron microscopy of BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors
Tumor-bearing lungs from initiated BRafCA/þ mice were
removed 11 weeks after Ad-Cre infection and ﬁxed in 2%
(v/v) glutaraldehyde, 1%(v/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L
sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 7.4. Following ﬁxation, samples
were incubated in 2% (v/v) osmium tetroxide in the same
buffer. Samples were then stained in 2% (v/v) aqueous uranyl
acetate, dehydrated in acetone, inﬁltrated, and then embedded
in LX-112 resin (Ladd Research Industries). Toluidine bluestained semi-thin sections were made to locate the areas of
interest. Samples were ultrathin sectioned on a Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome and counterstained with 0.8% lead
citrate. Grids were examined on a JEOL JEM-1230 (Transmission electron microscope, JEOL USA, Inc.) and photographed
with a Gatan UltraScan 1000 digital camera and DigitalMicrograph software (Gatan Inc.).
Lung tumor cell isolation and culture
Lungs of tumor-bearing BRafCA mice were perfused with
dispase (BD Biosciences) and individual lobes were minced
and further incubated with dispase and collagenase (Roche).
Cell suspensions were then ﬁltered and cultured in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% (v/v) normal calf
serum. Recombination of the conditional BRafCA allele was
veriﬁed using established genotyping protocols (18). Cell suspensions from lung cancer–bearing KRasLSL mice were
obtained in a similar manner and then passaged twice through
orthotopic implantation into nude mice before single-cell
suspensions were generated and established in culture in
DMEM with 10% (v/v) normal calf serum. The cell lines

described here have not been separately authenticated using
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or microsatellite DNA
markers. Cell proliferation assays were carried out using an
Alamar Blue cell viability assay (Invitrogen). PD0325901 was
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and applied to cells at
a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mmol/L. Similarly treated cells were
permeabilized, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by
FACScan for DNA content.

Results
BRafCA mice display an earlier onset and higher
multiplicity of lung tumors than KRasLSL mice
Genetically engineered KRasLSL or BRafCA mice carry knockin alleles of KRas or Braf, respectively, at the normal chromosomal loci that allow for conditional expression of either
oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in response to Cre recombinase (17, 18). Intranasal instillation of Ad-Cre elicits oncogene expression in the lung epithelium in a manner in which
the timing and frequency of oncogene-expressing cells can be
investigator-controlled. Lung epithelium expression of
KRASG12D is reported to lead initially to atypical adenomatous
hyperplasia (AAH) and then to development of benign lung
adenomas and ultimately to emergence of malignant non–
small cell lung cancers (17). Lung epithelium expression of
BRAFV600E also leads initially to AAH and then to benign lung
adenomas but progression to frank malignancy is rare and
appears to be constrained by cellular senescence (18). Despite
their similarities, a thorough side-by-side comparison between
these 2 models of lung tumorigenesis has not yet been
reported.
To minimize the inﬂuence of genetic modiﬁers of lung
tumorigenesis on our experiments, BRafCA/þ and KRasLSL/þ
mice were bred into an FVB/N genetic background for a
minimum of 4 generations and were then bred together to
generate compound BRafCA/þ;KRasLSL/þ mice. These mice
were further intercrossed for at least 3 generations. Experimental mice were generated by breeding compound BRafCA/þ;
KRasLSL/þ heterozygous mice with FVB/N mice resulting in
progeny heterozygous for either BRafCA or KRasLSL alleles on a
predominantly FVB/N genetic background.
The lung epithelium of BRafCA/þ or KRasLSL/þ littermates
was infected with 107 plaque-forming units (pfu) of Ad-Cre to
initiate expression of BRAFV600E or KRASG12D oncoproteins,
respectively. Mice were euthanized at 6 or 17 weeks following
initiation of oncogene expression at which time lungs were
processed for tumor analysis. Average tumor number and size
were quantiﬁed, and percentage of tumor burden was calculated as the area occupied by tumors per total section area as
described in Materials and Methods.
Six weeks after initiation, BRAFV600E expression led to
numerous detectable lung tumors and extensive tumor burden, whereas very few lung tumors were detected in mice with
KRASG12D expression in lung epithelium. Six weeks after AdCre infection, BRafCA mice had an average of approximately 23
lesions per lung section, whereas similarly treated KRasLSL
mice had an average of approximately 3 lesions per section [P
¼ 0.0017; Fig. 1A (top) and B]. In addition, individual tumors in

3050

Cancer Res; 72(12) June 15, 2012

the lungs of initiated BRafCA mice were approximately 8 times
larger than lesions initiated in KRasLSL mice (50,370 vs. 6,231
mm2, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1A and B). At 6 weeks, overall lung tumor
burden was signiﬁcantly higher in BRafCA mice than their
KRasLSL counterparts (7.3% vs. 0.28%, P < 0.0006; Fig. 1B)
At 17 weeks after initiation, lung tumors in BRafCA mice were
conﬂuent in many areas of the lung making individual tumor
number and size difﬁcult to quantify (Fig. 1A, middle). For this
reason, only tumor burden was quantiﬁed. Lungs of BRafCA
mice displayed approximately 26% tumor burden, whereas
KRasLSL mice had a burden of approximately 9% [P ¼
0.0009; Fig. 1A (top) and B]. It was not possible to compare
lung tumor burden between Ad-Cre–treated BRafCA or KRasLSL
mice at later time points due to the extensive benign tumor
burden in the BRafCA mice, which led to respiratory distress
and weight loss such that these mice had to be euthanized. In
contrast, at a time when all of the Ad-Cre–treated BRafCA had
been euthanized, all of the similarly treated KRasLSL mice
appeared healthy and maintained a normal weight, despite
the obvious lung tumor burden that they presented at
euthanasia.
BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors fail to progress beyond
low-grade, benign adenomas
To better characterize KRASG12D- or BRAFV600E-induced
lung tumors, lesions were classiﬁed as epithelial hyperplasia,
adenomatous hyperplasia, low- or high-grade adenomas (Fig.
1C) using criteria established by Nikitin and colleagues (26).
Epithelial hyperplasia was classiﬁed as regions of hyperplasia
originating from or directly associated with airways. Adenomatous hyperplasia was deﬁned as lesions originating from the
alveoli and measuring less than 100 mm in diameter. Adenomas
(lesions >100 mm) were classiﬁed as being low- or high-grade,
depending on the degree of cellular atypia. Percentage of each
tumor type per lung section was calculated as area of speciﬁc
lesion type per area of total lesion area. The statistical significance of differences in lung tumorigenesis between BRafCA
versus KRasLSL mice was assessed using the exact Wilcoxon
rank-sum test (27).
At 6 weeks, the lungs of Ad-Cre–treated BRafCA or KRasLSL
mice had a similar percentage of epithelial hyperplasia (9%
and 12.5%, respectively, P ¼ 0.23; Fig. 1C). The majority of
lesions in BRafCA mice (74%) were fully formed, low-grade
adenomas, compared with only 5% of such lesions in the
KRasLSL mice (P ¼ 0.002). Indeed, at 6 weeks, the vast majority
of the lesions in the KRasLSL mice (85%) were adenomatous
hyperplasias compared with only 17% of such lesions in BRafCA
mice (P ¼ 0.04).
At 17 weeks, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the
percentage of epithelial hyperplasias between BRafCA and
KRasLSL mice, (1.3% vs. 4%, respectively, P ¼ 0.52). Adenomatous hyperplasias were more prevalent in KRasLSL mice than in
BRafCA mice (30% vs. 11% respectively, P ¼ 0.0005). The
percentage of low-grade adenomas remained signiﬁcantly
higher in BRafCA mice than in KRasLSL mice (88% vs. 56%
respectively, P ¼ 0.002). Importantly, high-grade adenomas
were only observed in KRasLSL mice, where they comprised 10%
of the total observable lung lesions (P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 1C).

The majority of BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors appeared
benign and adenomatous with a structured papillary pattern
made up of seemingly well-differentiated, cuboidal epithelial
cells and lacking characteristics of high-grade tumors (Fig. 1A,
bottom). These observations are in accordance with our previous studies showing the benign nature of BRAFV600E-induced
lung tumors and their low rate of spontaneous malignant
progression (18). In contrast, despite the overall lower tumor
burden, approximately 10% of lung tumors in KRasLSL mice
appeared to be of higher grade, as evidenced by nuclear atypia,
such as prominent nucleoli and an increased nucleus to
cytoplasm ratio (Fig. 1A, bottom). Finally, we observed no
evidence of either local invasion, pleural effusion, or distant
metastatic spread in lung tumors arising in either BRafCA or
KRasLSL mice, which is consistent with our previous observations and those of others (17, 18, 20).

To determine whether there was a difference in proliferation
rate of KRASG12D- versus BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors, 17
weeks after initiation, appropriate mice were injected with
BrdUrd approximately 20 hours before euthanasia. Lung
sections were stained with antibodies against BrdUrd and
SP-C, a marker for alveolar type 2 pneumocytes expressed in
KRASG12D- and BRAFV600E-induced lung tumor cells (17, 18).
Tumor cell–speciﬁc proliferation was assessed by measuring the percentage of SP-C–positive cells that also stained
for BrdUrd incorporation by double label immunoﬂuorescence. By these criteria, 0.98% of BRAFV600E-expressing and
1.67% of KRASG12D-expressing tumor cells were BrdUrdpositive, respectively (P ¼ 0.12, Fig. 2). These data were
conﬁrmed by double label immunoﬂuorescence for Ki67/SPC double-positive cells. By these criteria, 2.35% of
BRAFV600E-expressing and 4.53% of KRASG12D-expressing

tumor cells were Ki67/SP-C double-positive (P ¼ 0.08, Fig.
2B). Hence, at 17 weeks, KRASG12D- and BRAFV600E-expressing tumors display a relatively low proliferative index and,
although there was a trend to a higher proliferative index in
KRASG12D-induced tumors, this did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance.
We next assessed signal pathway activation downstream of
oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E by immunohistochemical
staining for phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) or phospho-S6 (pS6)
in low- or high-grade adenomas. In general, the levels of
pERK1/2 and pS6 were low but detectable in both BRAFV600Eand KRASG12D-induced low-grade adenomas. However, we did
not detect a substantial elevation in pERK1/2 in KRASG12Dinduced high-grade adenomas, although elevated pS6 was
detected in these tumors (Fig. 3). These data are consistent
with the previous observations that neither KRASG12D nor
BRAFV600E induce high-level signal pathway activation during
the early stages of lung tumorigenesis (22).
BRAFV600E- and KRASG12D-induced lung tumors express
markers of alveolar type 1 and 2 pneumocytes
To further characterize lung tumors arising in Ad-Cre–
treated BRafCA or KRasLSL mice, we stained for expression of
markers of epithelial cells of the terminal bronchioles and
alveoli: Clara cell antigen (CCA); SP-C, and aquaporin 5 (AQP5).
Clara cells are CCA-positive but negative for SP-C and AQP5.
Alveolar type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes are SP-C–positive but
negative for CCA and AQP5. Alveolar type 1 (AT1) pneumo-

3052

Cancer Res; 72(12) June 15, 2012

cytes are AQP5-positive but negative for CCA and SP-C. As
previously reported, adenomas arising in both the BRafCA and
KRasLSL mice were largely CCA-negative (data not shown).
Interestingly, both BRAFV600E- and KRASG12D-induced lung
tumors were positive for both SP-C and AQP5, a combination
of marker expression not readily detected in the normal mouse
lung epithelium. SP-C was localized in a punctate manner
inside tumor cells consistent with its sequestration into lamellar bodies that are characteristic of AT2 cells (28). AQP5, an
integral membrane water channel, appeared membranous and
expressed asymmetrically on tumor cells consistent with its
normal expression on the apical surface of AT1 cells (Fig. 4A;
ref. 29).
To rule out the possibility that the apparent double positivity
of lung tumor cells for both SP-C and AQP5 was not simply due
to the close juxtaposition of 2 different cell types, we analyzed
BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors by electron microscopy. This
analysis revealed that BRAFV600E-induced tumors were composed of cuboidal AT2-like cells with prominent lamellar
bodies (Fig. 4B, arrowed) and were not inﬁltrated by normal
AT1-like cells. To further analyze the extent of tumor cell
expression of AT1 markers, we stained for RAGE (receptor
for advanced glycosylation end products) and podoplanin.
However, neither BRAFV600E- nor KRASG12D-induced lung
tumors expressed these proteins (data not shown). To test
whether the combination of SP-C and AQP5 expression is
observed in human lung cancer, we stained sections of 8 lung
cancers with documented BRAF mutation with antisera

on tumor frequency or the extent of tumor burden initiated by
BRAFV600E. Indeed, BRafCA;Aqp5/ mice developed benign
adenomas that were indistinguishable from those that formed
in control BRafCA;Aqp5þ/þ mice. As expected, lung tumors
arising in BRafCA;Aqp5þ/þ mice were double-positive for both
SP-C and AQP5 expression, whereas lung tumors arising in
BRafCA;Aqp5/ mice were SP-C–positive but negative for
AQP5 (Fig. 4C). These data conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of the AQP5
antiserum and indicate that BRAFV600E-induced (and by extension KRASG12D-induced) lung tumors are indeed positive for at
least one marker of AT1 cells. However, on the basis of their
cuboidal morphology and the presence of lamellar bodies,
tumor cells appear most similar to AT2 cells. Finally, these
data unequivocally showed that AQP5 is dispensable for
BRAFV600E-induced lung tumorigenesis.
BRAFV600E-initiated lung tumors regress upon MEK1/2
inhibition
BRAFV600E-initiated lung tumorigenesis is prevented by the
potent and speciﬁc MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901 (18, 31, 32).
However, others have reported that inhibition of KRASG12Dinitiated lung tumorigenesis requires blockade of both
RAF!MEK!ERK and PI30 -kinase!AKT!mTORC signaling
(33). Consequently, we sought to test the ability of single-agent
MEK1/2 inhibition (with PD0325901) to promote regression of
established BRAFV600E- or KRASG12D-induced lung tumors. To
facilitate this analysis, we generated compound BRafCA;LucRep
mice carrying the conditional BRafCA allele in combination
with a Cre-activated luciferase transgene (24). Ad-Cre infection
of the lung epithelium of these mice initiates oncogenic
BRAFV600E expression and the expression of luciferase, which
can be used to image tumorigenesis and response to pathway-

targeted therapy using a Xenogen In Vivo Imaging Systems
(IVIS).
Bioluminescence (in p/s) was measured in compound
BRafCA;LucRep mice at different times after initiation with
Ad-Cre (107 pfu). Baseline signal was determined to be
2  106 p/s by measuring bioluminescence from Ad-Cre–
infected LucRep littermates lacking the Cre-activated BRafCA
allele. Starting 5 weeks after Ad-Cre infection, bioluminescence in the lung was observed to increase in a representative BRafCA;LucRep mouse and at 9 weeks had increased
30-fold to 6  107 p/s (Fig. 5). At this time, PD0325901
was administered orally for 5 weeks on a 5-d/wk dosing
schedule. Over this period, the luciferase signal gradually
decreased until it was below baseline (Fig. 5). In addition,
at the time of drug administration, this mouse appeared
hunched, had lost body weight, and was displaying the signs
of respiratory distress that typify the end stage of conﬂuent
BRAFV600E-induced benign lung tumorigenesis. Following
5 weeks of drug treatment, the mouse appeared healthy,
had gained 8.7 grams in body weight (40% increase), and
no longer displayed signs of respiratory distress. Upon
euthanasia of similarly treated BRafCA mice, we could ﬁnd
little or no evidence of residual tumors following 5 weeks of
MEK1/2 inhibition (data not shown). This experiment was
repeated with an additional group of 5 BRafCA;LucRep mice,
all of which displayed robust tumor regression and health
status improvements in response to MEK1/2 inhibition
(data not shown). Despite the profound tumor regression,
cessation of MEK1/2 inhibitor administration led to rapid
regrowth of lung tumors in all the mice. These data indicate
that MEK!ERK signaling is required for both initiation and
maintenance of BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors. However,

the rapid regrowth of lung tumors following cessation of
drug treatment indicates the presence of tumor-initiating
cells that are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of PD0325901.
To assess the effect of MEK1/2 inhibition on KRASG12Dinduced lung tumorigenesis, a cohort of KRasLSL mice was
initiated by infection with Ad-Cre, and 4 weeks later, a time
before the onset of tumorigenesis (Fig. 1), mice were treated
with either vehicle or PD0325901 for 6 weeks at which time they
were euthanized and lung tumor burden assessed (Fig. 6A
compares vehicle vs. PD325901 – PD901). MEK1/2 inhibition
with PD0325901 treatment was highly effective in the prevention of KRASG12D-driven lung tumors (Fig. 6A). Whereas
vehicle-treated mice had 12.5 tumors per lung section,
PD0325901-treated mice had an average of 1.4 lung tumors
per section—a 9-fold decrease in lung tumor incidence (P ¼

0.0012; Fig. 6A). In addition, we observed a 9-fold difference in
the size of individual lesions when comparing control versus
PD0325901-treated mice (69,354 mm2 in vehicle-treated mice
compared with 7.837 mm2 for drug-treated mice, P ¼ 0.0002; Fig.
6A). The differences in tumor number and size contributed to
an overall 47-fold lower tumor burden in PD0325901-treated
mice than in vehicle-treated littermates (3.4% vs. 0.072%, P ¼
0.0005; Fig. 6A). These data indicate that RAF!MEK!ERK
signaling is essential for the onset of KRASG12D-induced lung
tumorigenesis.
Next, we assessed the efﬁcacy of PD0325901 in promoting
regression of preexisting KRASG12D-initiated lung tumors. Ten
weeks after initiating KRASG12D expression, mice were treated
with either vehicle or PD0325901 for a further 6 weeks at which
time they were euthanized and lung tumor burden assessed

(Fig. 6B compares vehicle vs. PD325901 – PD901). Mice treated
with PD0325901 showed signiﬁcantly fewer tumors per lung
section than vehicle-treated littermates (7.6 vs. 25.3, P ¼ 0.01).
Moreover, whereas vehicle-treated mice displayed mostly
high-grade lung adenomas, lesions in PD0325901-treated mice
were predominantly epithelial or adenomatous hyperplasias
and thus generally smaller than tumors observed in vehicletreated mice. However, the difference in overall lesion size
between PD0325901- and vehicle-treated mice was not significant (129,679 vs. 305,584 mm2, P ¼ 0.08). This is likely due to the
presence of residual large adenomas (Fig. 6B, PD325901-T
boxed) remaining after the full course of drug treatment, which
were presumably resistant to the effects of MEK inhibition.
Importantly, overall tumor burden was decreased approximately 8-fold in PD0325901-treated KRasLSL mice compared
with control (19% compared with 2.2%, P ¼ 0.0002; Fig. 6B).
To unequivocally show regression of preexisting KRASG12Dinduced lung tumors, we initiated tumorigenesis in a representative KRasLSL;LucRep mouse and monitored tumor growth
by bioluminescent imaging as described above (Fig. 6C). Baseline signal (2.6  106 p/s) was determined as the average signal
of KRasþ/þ;LucRep mice treated with the same dose (108 pfu) of
Ad-Cre. This KRasLSL/þ;LucRep mouse displayed a consistent
bioluminescent signal approximately 17-fold above baseline
11.5 weeks after initiation of KRASG12D expression, at which
time PD0325901 was administered. After 8.5 weeks of
PD0325901 treatment, the bioluminescent signal from lung
tumor burden was reduced approximately 6-fold (4.5  107–
8  106 p/s), consistent with the reduction in tumor burden
assessed by histochemical analysis of lung sections (Fig. 6B).
However, unlike the situation with BRAFV600E-induced lung
tumors, MEK1/2 inhibition did not result in the reduction of
the bioluminescent signal to baseline. Moreover, as with
BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors, cessation of PD0325901
administration led to rapid regrowth of KRASG12D-expressing
lung tumors requiring that this mouse be euthanized 2 weeks
later (Fig. 6C). Cumulatively, these data provide compelling
evidence that inhibition of RAF!MEK!ERK signaling both
prevents the growth and promotes the regression of preexisting of KRASG12D-induced lung tumors. However, the presence
of adenomas at the end of the drug treatment period may
explain the incomplete tumor regression observed in KRasLSL
mice and, thus, why KRASG12D-driven lung tumors appear less
sensitive to MEK1/2 inhibition than their BRAFV600E-expressing counterparts.
BRAFV600E- or KRASG12D-expressing lung tumor–derived
cell lines are sensitive to MEK inhibition in vitro
The antitumor effects of PD0325901 against BRAFV600E- or
KRASG12D-induced tumors in vivo could be mediated either by
tumor cell autonomous or nonautonomous mechanisms or
some combination thereof. Hence, to determine whether there
is a tumor cell autonomous response to MEK inhibition, we
used cell lines isolated from either BRAFV600E- or KRASG12Dinduced lung tumors. Whereas lung tumor lines can be generated from lung cancer–bearing KRasLSL mice, this is not the
case for similarly treated BRafCA mice. This likely reﬂects the
fact that BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors are benign and

3056

Cancer Res; 72(12) June 15, 2012

tumor cells are thought to be irreversibly arrested in the
cell-cycle division due to senescence (18). Consequently, we
infected compound BRafCA/þ;Trp53lox/lox mice with Ad-Cre to
initiate BRAFV600E and silence TP53 expression. These mice
develop abundant high-grade lung tumors with a propensity
for malignant lung cancer progression (18). Ten weeks later,
mice were euthanized and independent BRAFV600E/TP53null
lung cancer–derived cell lines were established as described in
Materials and Methods. Cre-mediated recombination of the
BRafCA and Trp53lox alleles in the various cell lines was conﬁrmed by PCR. Independent KRASG12D-expressing lung
tumor–derived cell lines were derived from Ad-Cre–infected
KRasLSL/þ mice in which spontaneous progression to non–
small cell lung cancer was observed. Immunoblot analysis
revealed that KRASG12D-expressing cell lines express detectable p53 (Shai and McMahon; unpublished data).
Treatment of BRAFV600E- or KRASG12D-expressing lung
tumor cells with 1 mmol/L PD0325901 for 48 hours led to
almost complete inhibition of proliferation compared with
vehicle (DMSO) control (Fig. 7A) with comparable effects of
PD0325901 observed on both BRAFV600E- and KRASG12Dexpressing lung tumor cells. Analysis of the cell-cycle proﬁle
of control versus PD0325901-treated cells revealed an accumulation of both KRASG12D- and BRAFV600E-expressing lung
tumor cells in G1 and a decrease of cells in S-phase (Fig. 7B),
consistent with the observed inhibition of cell proliferation. In
parallel, vehicle versus PD0325901-treated cells were stained
for a marker of apoptosis (Annexin-V) and cell death (propidium iodide; PI). Whereas there was a modest increase of
apoptotic and dead cells in PD0325901-treated cultures, the
majority of cells remained Annexin-V- and PI-negative (data
not shown).
In parallel, cell extracts were analyzed to assess the effect of
MEK inhibition on signal pathway activation. As expected,
PD0325901 treatment led to increased phospho-MEK1/2 but
decreased phospho-ERK1/2, consistent with the mechanism of
action of this agent (Fig. 7C). Both cell lines also displayed
decreased expression of cyclin D1, consistent with the known
role of ERK1/2 signaling in cyclin D1 regulation (34). We also
detected modest induction of the proapoptotic BCL-2 family
member BIM, consistent with its regulation by ERK signaling
(35), and the presence of cleaved caspase-3 in PD0325901treated cells. Cumulatively, these data suggest that the antitumor effect of PD0325901 in mouse models of KRASG12D- or
BRAFV600E-induced lung tumorigenesis results, at least in part,
from direct antiproliferative effects of the agent on tumor cells
mediated by cell-cycle arrest and accompanied by a modest
induction of apoptosis.

Discussion
Mutationally activated KRAS is a feature common to approximately 25% of all cancers and is particularly prevalent in
pancreas, colon, and lung cancer (2, 3, 36). Consistent with its
documented importance in human lung cancer, expression of
oncogenic KRASG12D in the mouse lung epithelium leads to the
development of non–small cell adenocarcinomas, some of
which have a propensity for metastasis (17, 20, 21). However,

it remains unclear, which of its various effector pathways are
critical for KRASG12D-induced lung tumor initiation and maintenance. Here, we show that RAF!MEK!ERK signaling is
both necessary and sufﬁcient for the early stages of KRASG12Dinduced tumorigenesis up to the formation of low-grade
adenomas. Consistent with this, expression of oncogenic
BRAFV600E in the lung epithelium leads to development of
benign lung tumors with most of the same histologic and
morphologic features but with strikingly enhanced efﬁciency
compared with KRASG12D. One explanation for this difference
may be the efﬁciency of Cre-mediated recombination of the
conditional BRafCA and KRasLSL alleles, which is not readily
measurable in the lung epithelium. Another possibility is that
there may be more cells with tumorigenic potential that
express BRAF compared with KRAS. Finally, the efﬁciency of
lung tumorigenesis may reﬂect a better ability of BRAFV600E to
elevate MEK!ERK signaling compared with KRASG12D.
Although we did not see a difference in pERK between
KRASG12D- or BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors, we were not
able to assess pERK levels in single initiated cells to determine
whether there may be differences between the 2 oncogenes in
signal pathway engagement. Although this highly reproducible
difference in the efﬁciency of BRAFV600E- versus KRASG12Dinduced lung tumorigenesis was surprising, it is not without
precedent. For example, whereas BRAFV600E elicits papillary
thyroid cancer when expressed in mouse thyrocytes, KRASG12D

www.aacrjournals.org

expression had no effect in the thyroid unless combined with
PTEN silencing (37, 38).
Although BRAFV600E elicits abundant lung tumors at early
time points, they remain low-grade, benign and rarely progress
to lung cancer (18). In contrast, despite the overall reduced
efﬁciency of lung tumorigenesis, KRasLSL mice invariably develop high-grade tumors with a strong propensity for further
malignant progression (17). Whereas evidence suggests that
high-grade lesions emerge from more benign tumors, it
remains possible that these lesions emerge from a different
cell of origin (17, 22). To explore the possibility that KRASG12Dor BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors may display phenotypic
differences reﬂective of their cell of origin, we stained tumors
for markers of cells of the distal lung epithelium. Whereas both
KRASG12D- and BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors types lacked
CCA expression, they were uniformly double-positive for SP-C
and AQP5, markers of AT2 and AT1 pneumocytes, respectively,
and a combination of markers not detected in normal lung.
However, by most other criteria, KRASG12D- and BRAFV600Einduced lung tumor cells resembled AT2 cells. Consequently, it
is unclear why the AT2-like cells in KRASG12D- or BRAFV600Edriven lung tumors express an AT1 marker such as AQP5, but
increased signaling through the MEK pathway may inﬂuence
expression of this protein in AT2 cells. Overall, the data stress
the similarity of the cellular phenotype of both KRASG12D- or
BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors and suggest that the ability of

KRASG12D to promote malignant progression at late time
points may be a result of differences in signaling caused by
this oncogene perhaps reﬂected by the elevated phospho-S6
detected in high-grade KRASG12D-induced tumors. Finally, It
has been proposed that the cell of origin of KRASG12D-driven
lung tumors is a bronchioalveolar stem cell (BASC), which
coexpresses both CCA and SP-C (39). Although we detected
small numbers of double CCA/SP-C–positive cells in
BRAFV600E-driven tumors, not all tumors contained such cells
and their frequency was less than 1% of the total tumor cells
(data not shown).
To explore the importance of MEK!ERK signaling in
BRAFV600E- or KRASG12D-driven tumors, we used PD0325901,
a highly selective and potent inhibitor of MEK1/2 (31, 32). In
vivo bioluminescent imaging showed the ability of this agent,
not only to prevent the onset of BRAFV600E-induced tumorigenesis (18) but also to promote dramatic regression of preexisting lung tumors. PD0325901 treatment also effectively
prevented the formation of KRASG12D-driven tumors and
promoted the regression of preexisting lung tumors, consistent
with the work of others (33, 40). However, the magnitude of
tumor regression in the KRasLSL mice was less dramatic than
that observed in BRafCA mice and, at euthanasia, we detected
fully formed adenomas in the lungs of PD0325901-treated
KRasLSL mice, which were presumably resistant to the cytotoxic effects of MEK inhibition. In addition, despite the striking
effects of MEK1/2 inhibition on BRAFV600E-induced lung
tumorigenesis, we were unable to eradicate tumor-initiating
cells from the lungs of these animals, which rapidly regrew lung
tumors upon cessation of drug treatment. The reasons for
these observations are the subject of ongoing investigation.
Tumor cell autonomous effects of MEK1/2 inhibition were
established using cultured cells isolated from BRAFV600E- or
KRASG12D-driven lung tumors. Interestingly, although such cell
lines were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of MEK
inhibition and displayed some evidence of apoptosis, we did

not observe substantial involution of these cell cultures. This
leaves open the possibility that MEK1/2 inhibition has both
tumor cell autonomous and nonautonomous effects that
contribute to the regression of BRAFV600E- and KRASG12Dinduced lung tumors in vivo. However, these data emphasize
the central importance of RAF!MEK!ERK signaling in
KRASG12D-induced lung tumorigenesis in the mouse.
Because mutationally activated KRAS remains an intractable
pharmacologic target, it is possible that targeting MEK1/2,
either alone or in combination chemotherapy, may represent a viable approach for targeting KRAS-induced lung
cancer (11).
