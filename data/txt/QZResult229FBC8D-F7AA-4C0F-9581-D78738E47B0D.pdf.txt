ABSTRACT
The prognosis is generally poor for patients suffering from glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) due to radiation and drug resistance. Prosurvival signaling
originating from focal adhesion hubs essentially contributes to therapy resistance
and tumor aggressiveness. As the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely
elusive, we addressed whether targeting of the focal adhesion proteins particularly
interesting new cysteine-histidine-rich 1 (PINCH1), integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and
ILK associated phosphatase (ILKAP) modulates GBM cell radioresistance. Intriguingly,
PINCH1, ILK and ILKAP depletion sensitized p53-wildtype, but not p53-mutant, GBM
cells to radiotherapy. Concomitantly, these cells showed inactivated Glycogen synthase
kinase-3β (GSK3β) and reduced proliferation. For PINCH1 and ILKAP knockdown,
elevated levels of radiation-induced γH2AX/53BP1-positive foci, as a marker for
DNA double strand breaks, were observed. Mechanistically, we identified radiationinduced phosphorylation of DNA protein kinase (DNAPK), an important DNA repair
protein, to be dependent on ILKAP. This interaction was fundamental to radiation
survival of p53-wildtype GBM cells. Conclusively, our data suggest an essential role of
PINCH1, ILK and ILKAP for the radioresistance of p53-wildtype GBM cells and provide
evidence for DNAPK functioning as a central mediator of ILKAP signaling. Strategies
for targeting focal adhesion proteins in combination with radiotherapy might be a
promising approach for patients with GBM.

molecular resistance mechanisms could prompt the
development of new drugs and facilitate more effective
treatment combinations.
In addition to a variety of well recognized gene
mutations and epigenetic alterations in GBM [6], receptor
tyrosine kinases, cytoplasmic protein kinases and integrins
play an important role in resistance to radiotherapy in
different tumor types [2, 7–14]. We recently reported

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most
common primary brain malignancy in adults [1]. Despite
great efforts to optimize multimodal therapy regimens,
the prognosis of patients with GBM is exceptionally poor
due to the high invasive potential and the intrinsic therapy
resistance of the tumor cells [1–5]. Therefore, clarifying

a significant reduction in GBM cell radioresistance
through targeting of β1 integrin [10], which facilitates
cell binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM). However,
the exact mechanism how integrin-mediated adhesion to
ECM confers radioresistance to GBM and other cancer
cells remains to be elusive.
A ternary protein complex composed of integrinlinked kinase (ILK), particularly interesting new
cysteine-histidine-rich 1 (PINCH1) and parvin is key
to integrin-mediated adhesion and the formation of
focal adhesions [15]. While targeting of ILK results in
radioresistance in head and neck and lung cancer cells and
in radiosensitization of GBM cells [16–18], inhibition
of PINCH1 causes radio- and chemosensitization in
various tumor models [19, 20]. The unconventional
structure of ILK that categorizes it as a pseudokinase
[15] warranted further investigation to identify the role
of ILK in signal transduction. One of its interacting
partners is ILK-associated phosphatase (ILKAP). ILKAP
has catalytic serine/threonine (S/T) phosphatase activity
and belongs to the protein phosphatase 2C family [21]. In
addition to its participation in cell cycling and apoptosis
[21–23], ILKAP can shuttle between the cytoplasm
and the nucleus using the importin nuclear trafficking
system [24]. Further potential ILKAP-associated proteins
include ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2), a signaling
molecule of the MAPK pathway regulating invasion and
cell motility [24, 25], and the tumor suppressor protein
p53 [25].
p53 is frequently mutated in malignant tumors,
where it is central to modifications in cell cycling, DNA
repair and survival of cancer cells [26–30]. In response
to cytotoxic stress, such as ionizing radiation, p53 is
activated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) to
control cell cycling and to form a protein complex with
DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK) [26, 27].
Irradiation induces DNAPK autophosphorylation at
T2609 and its participation in the repair of DNA double
strand breaks (DSB) [31, 32]. Despite detailed insights
into nuclear DNA repair processes, the mechanisms
connecting integrin-associated signaling and cell
adhesion-mediated radioresistance with DNA repair
proteins like DNAPK and ATM remain unknown.
Intriguingly, we recently reported that non-homologous
end joining repair of DSB is conducted via the β1
integrin/FAK/JNK1 signaling axis in head and neck
cancer cells [33].
In this study, we show that knockdown of
PINCH1, ILK or ILKAP sensitizes p53-wildtype
GBM cell lines to ionizing radiation. Mechanistically,
ILKAP depletion results in p53 hyperphosphorylation
and stabilization, DNAPK hypophosphorylation and
increased DSB numbers after irradiation, indicating a
crucial role of ILKAP for the cellular radiation response
of human GBM cells.

PINCH1 and ILK were overexpressed in
glioblastoma multiforme
Because PINCH1 and ILK are overexpressed
in a variety of tumor entities [19, 34], we analyzed the
mRNA expression in 757 samples of GBM and 127
samples of normal brain using the Oncomine data base
(www.oncomine.org) (Supplementary Table S1). As
shown in Figure 1, PINCH1 and ILK, but not ILKAP,
were significantly overexpressed in GBM biopsies
in comparison to normal brain tissue (Figure 1A).
Interestingly, ILK and ILKAP expression levels strongly
correlated (R = 0.42; P < 0.0001) in normal as well as
malignant tissue (Figure 1B). Similar results were
obtained for ILK and PINCH1 (R = 0.22; P < 0.0001),
which were in line with other studies [35], while there
was no significant association of PINCH1 and ILKAP
expression (Figure 1B).

Knockdown of integrin-associated proteins
reduced survival and radioresistance of
p53-wildtype glioblastoma cells
Targeting β1 integrin in glioblastoma cells enhances
cellular radiosensitivity and hampers DNA repair [7, 10].
However, the molecular mechanisms and in particular the
downstream molecules mediating these effects are widely
unknown. We found that β1 integrin as well as the integrinassociated proteins PINCH1 and ILK were mainly located
in focal adhesions of glioblastoma cells, whereas ILKAP
was expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 2A
and Figure 2B). Since the ILKAP antibody used for
Western blot was not suitable for immunofluorescence,
localization of ILKAP was revealed by transfection of an
ILKAP-GFP construct. To analyze the impact of PINCH1,
ILK and ILKAP on cell survival, we performed efficient
siRNA-mediated depletion in four different glioblastoma
cell lines (Figure 2C). While ILK silencing resulted in corepression of PINCH1, PINCH1 knockdown had no effect
on ILK expression (Figure 2C).
In p53-wildtype A172 and U87MG cells,
knockdown of ILK, PINCH1 or ILKAP reduced basal
survival (Figure 2D) and enhanced the radiosensitivity
(Figure 3A–3C). In contrast, depletion of integrinassociated proteins failed to modify the cellular
radiosensitivity of p53-mutant U138MG and LN229 cells
(Figure 3A–3C).

Depletion of PINCH1, ILK or ILKAP
differentially affected DNA synthesis
Because modulation of cell cycle distribution and
DNA synthesis impact cellular radiosensitivity [36], we

analyzed the effect of PINCH1, ILK and ILKAP inhibition
on the cell cycle proteins Glycogen synthase kinase-3β
(GSK3β) and Cyclin D1 as well as on the percentage
of S-phase cells as a marker of proliferation. As shown
in Figure 4, single downregulation of all three proteins
significantly increased GSK3β S9 phosphorylation
and Cyclin D1 expression in both A172 and U87MG
glioblastoma cell lines (Figure 4A and Figure 4B).
Exceptions were Cyclin D1 in ILK A172 knockdown cells
and phospho-GSK3β S9 in PINCH1 U87MG knockdown
cells.
Regarding BrdU incorporation as a proliferation
index, we found the number of BrdU-positive cells
decreased upon PINCH1, ILK and ILKAP depletion
(Figure 4C). Importantly, while the effect of PINCH1 and
ILK knockdown on the cell cycle was most pronounced
after 48 h, ILKAP depletion elicited a continuous
decline in the BrdU-positive cell compartment over the
observation period of 100 h (Figure 4C).

we examined the number of radiation-induced,
γH2AX/53BP1-positive foci as a marker for DSB after
inhibiting PINCH1, ILK or ILKAP. Strikingly, PINCH1
and ILKAP-depleted cells demonstrated significantly
more γH2AX/53BP1-positive foci in 6-Gy irradiated cells
compared with controls (Figure 4D and Figure 4E). ILK
knockdown, however, only elicited elevated numbers of
γH2AX/53BP1-positive foci in U87MG, but not in A172
cells (Figure 4E).

Expression of wildtype p53 was essential for
ILKAP-mediated radioresistance
To evaluate the role of p53 status in ILKAPmediated radiosensitization, we analyzed the expression
and phosphorylation of p53 and p21 after irradiation in
ILKAP-depleted cells (Figure 5A and Figure 5B). In
comparison with controls, ILKAP knockdown resulted
in enhanced expression and stabilization of both p53
and p21 as well as p53 S15 hyperphosphorylation after
radiation (Figure 5A and Figure 5B). Dual p53/ILKAP
targeting abrogated the radiosensitization mediated by
single ILKAP targeting (Figure 5C). These results were
confirmed in U87MG cells with a stable shRNA-mediated
p53 suppression (U87MG shp53) (Figure 5D–5G). Here,
ILKAP knockdown only reduced radiation survival

after irradiation, while ATM phosphorylation was increased
(Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure S2). Both DNAPK
and ATM have been reported to regulate radiation survival
of tumor cells [27, 31, 38–40]. To assess a putative
functional interaction between ILKAP and DNAPK or
ATM, we performed single DNAPK or ATM knockdown
and compared the radiosensitivity to cells with simultaneous
knockdown of ILKAP. DNAPK and ATM silencing had
no significant effect on basal glioblastoma cell survival
(Figure 6B). However, radiosensitization occurred upon
DNAPK but, surprisingly, not upon ATM depletion
(Figure 6B). Combined ILKAP/DNAPK knockdown
further reduced the surviving fraction of non-irradiated cells
in comparison to ILKAP knockdown alone (Figure 6C).

ILKAP modulated the phosphorylation of
DNAPK after irradiation
Radiosensitization and enhanced levels of radiationinduced foci indicate a function of ILKAP in DNA repair.
Interestingly, nuclear ILKAP expression increased after
irradiation, indicating a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling
of ILKAP (Supplementary Figure S1). After ILKAP
knockdown, cells showed reduced DNAPK phosphorylation

Radiation survival after ILKAP or ILKAP/DNAPK
depletion was not significantly different, indicating that both
proteins are part of the same signaling axis (Figure 6C).
To clarify the role of p53, we achieved p53/
ILKAP/DNAPK triple knockdown and found this
to have no impact on basal survival relative to p53/
ILKAP depletion (Figure 6D). However, DNAPK
knockdown on top of p53/ILKAP silencing restored
the radiosensitizing potential of ILKAP targeting
(Figure 6D). These data strongly suggest that all three
molecules, ILKAP, p53 and DNAPK, interdependently
and collectively control the radiosensitivity of p53wildtype glioblastoma cells. Based on these data, we

hypothesize that DNAPK functions downstream of
ILKAP or p53 (Supplementary Figure S3).

DISCUSSION
Identification of the molecular mechanisms
underlying resistance is fundamental for GBM
therapy optimization. In this study, we analyzed the
role of PINCH1, ILK and ILKAP on the cellular
radiation response of GBM cells. We found significant
radiosensitization and DNA repair perturbation,
particularly after siRNA-mediated knockdown of ILKAP.

interplay between ILKAP, p53 and DNAPK, which is key
for the radiation response of GBM cells.
Differential target expression in tumor versus normal
tissues provides a therapeutic window for moleculartargeting strategies and might be used as a biomarker
profile for personalized medicine. Both PINCH1 and ILK
are upregulated in different tumor entities [19, 41, 42].
In line with previous studies, our analysis showed that
PINCH1 and ILK were significantly overexpressed
in glioblastoma biopsies compared with normal brain
tissue. While the PINCH1 expression data in human
cancers are largely homogeneous, ILK expression seems
to be more dependent on the tissue of origin, the grade
of cellular differentiation and the tumor type [43, 44].
PINCH1 and ILK are both part of a ternary protein
complex, together with parvin, and are interdependently
regulated [45]. Accordingly, our co-expression analysis
revealed a correlation between PINCH1 and ILK mRNA
levels as well as a downregulation of PINCH1 after ILK
knockdown. Similar results were obtained for ILK and
ILKAP. Surprisingly, PINCH1 depletion had no effect on
ILK expression in our experimental setup. These results
are different from the data of Fukuda and colleagues,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which show diminished ILK protein levels after PINCH1
knockdown in HeLa cells [45]. We therefore conclude that
the interdependence between PINCH1 and ILK is strongly
influenced by tumor and tissue type.
Molecules involved in ECM adhesion have been
shown to essentially control important cell functions,
including tumor growth and cell survival [9, 11,
46–50]. Inhibition of integrins, the main ECM receptors,
reduces tumor cell survival and sensitizes GBM cells to
radiotherapy [7, 10]. Our model relies on two facts: (i)
PINCH1 targeting is known to elicit radiosensitization in
tumors other than GBM [19, 20] and (ii) ILK has been
reported as antisurvival determinant in irradiated cells
[17, 51]. In line with this knowledge, we found decreased
basal and radiation survival of glioblastoma cells after
PINCH1 depletion and far less after ILK targeting. In
addition, we investigated the ILK interacting protein
ILKAP as a target for GBM.
Interestingly, in light of the high p53 mutation
frequency in GBM [52], radiosensitization was only
achieved by PINCH1, ILK or ILKAP knockdown in the
p53-wildtype cell lines A172 and U87MG. Because β1
integrin inhibition reduces radiation survival independent

of p53 status [7, 10], the downstream signaling of
integrins, in particular the function of ILK, PINCH1 and
ILKAP for the integrin-mediated radioresistance, seems to
be different between p53-wildtype and p53-mutated GBM
cell lines. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is a central
mediator of integrin signaling in several tumor entities
[48, 53], could play a significant role in this process.
This hypothesis is supported by a recent study showing a
radiosensitizing effect of pharmacological FAK inhibition
in U138MG (p53-mutated), but not in A172 or U87MG
(p53-wildtype) cells [54].
Knockdown of ILK, PINCH1 or ILKAP altered
cell cycling, with ILKAP depletion exerting the most
pronounced effect. This was in line with enhanced
GSK3β S9 phosphorylation and Cyclin D1 expression.
Similar results on GSK3β have been obtained in
human embryonic kidney cells [21]. Concurrently, both
PINCH1 and ILKAP depletion were accompanied by an
increase in radiation-induced γH2AX/53BP1-positive
foci, suggesting a potential role for these molecules in
DNA repair processes.
Based on the most congruent data obtained for
ILKAP targeting on GBM cell radiosensitization, we
further examined the association between ILKAP
and p53. First, the radiosensitization after ILKAP
knockdown was diminished by p53 depletion, indicating
that p53 functions as a downstream mediator of ILKAP.
Second, ILKAP knockdown promoted enhanced
p53 protein stabilization and radiation-induced
phosphorylation at S15. ILKAP may act as a direct
p53 dephosphorylator, as shown for other structurally
similar PP2Cδ phosphatases [55]. This hypothesis is
further supported by Højlys-Larsen and colleagues
showing phospho-p53 S15 peptides in ILKAP affinity
pulldowns, which points to a molecular interaction of
these two proteins [25].
Since we not only observed reduced radiation
survival, but also enhanced DSB after irradiation of
ILKAP depleted cells, we analyzed phosphorylation
kinetics of the important DNA repair proteins DNAPK
and ATM. We found an ATM hyperphosphorylation
at S1981 in the absence of ILKAP. These results
are consistent with previous data indicating ATM as
a potential target for ILKAP phosphatase activity
[25]. As ATM has been shown to regulate DNAPK
phosphorylation at T2609 [56], we were surprised
to find an attenuated radiation-induced DNAPK
phosphorylation after ILKAP silencing. One explanation
for this could be that DNAPK phosphorylation at T2609
is regulated by more than one mechanism including a
possible role of DNAPK itself by an autophosphorylation
process [57, 58].
Although ATM is a known modulator of radiation
survival [39, 40, 59], knockdown of ATM did not affect
radiosensitivity in p53-wildtype glioma cells. Similar
observations have been described by Biddlestonewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Thorpe and colleagues. In this study, ATM inhibition
preferentially sensitized p53-mutant glioblastoma
cell lines but not p53-wildtype cells [60]. In contrast,
DNAPK as well as combined ILKAP/DNAPK
depletion led to significant radiosensitization which was
comparable to the single ILKAP knockdown. Therefore
we concluded that both proteins are part of the same
signaling axis that regulates DNA repair and radiation
resistance. Accordingly, the proper function of p53
after DNA damage is dependent on p53 interacting with
DNAPK, suggesting a putative link between DNAPK and
ILKAP/p53 signaling [26, 27]. As DNAPK knockdown
also reduces the radiation survival of p53-depleted cells,
DNAPK seems to be localized most downstream in this
signaling pathway.
In summary, our study demonstrates an essential
role for PINCH1, ILK and ILKAP in the radioresistance
of p53-wildtype GBM cells. Mechanistically, the data
presented provide evidence for DNAPK functioning as
a central mediator of ILKAP signaling. Thus, strategies
for targeting focal adhesion proteins in combination with
radiotherapy might be a promising therapeutic approach
for patients with GBM.

published [10]. Cells were irradiated 24 h after
plating. Cell colonies with a minimum of 50 cells were
microscopically counted at 9 days (U87MG, LN229) or 12
days (A172, U138MG) after plating. Plating efficiencies
were calculated as follows: numbers of colonies formed/
numbers of cells plated. Surviving fractions (SF) were
calculated as follows: numbers of colonies formed/
(numbers of cells plated [irradiated] × plating efficiency
[unirradiated]). Each point on the survival curves
represents the mean surviving fraction from at least three
independent experiments.

Tumor cell lines A172, U138MG, U87MG and
LN229 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Authenticated U87MG
shp53 cells with stable RNAi of p53 and U87MG shLuc
control have been described previously [61]. Cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
containing Glutamax-I supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum and 1% non-essential amino acids (PAA, Cölbe,
Germany) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing
7% CO2. In all experiments, asynchronously growing cells
were used. Irradiation was delivered at room temperature
using single doses of 200 kV X-rays (Yxlon Y.TU 320;
Yxlon, Copenhagen, Denmark) filtered with 0.5 mm
Cu. The absorbed dose was measured using a Duplex
dosimeter (PTW, Freiburg, Germany). The dose-rate was
approximately 1.3 Gy/min at 20 mA and applied doses
ranged from 0 to 6 Gy.

Total protein extracts and western blotting
Adherent cells were rinsed with ice-cold 1XPBS
prior to harvesting total proteins by scraping using
modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1%
Nonidet-P40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, Complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche), 1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM NaF). Cells in suspension
were centrifuged and washed with ice-cold 1XPBS. The
supernatant was discarded and the remainder was lysed
with modified RIPA buffer. Samples were stored at −80°C.
Total protein amounts were measured via BCA assay
(Pierce, Bonn, Germany). After SDS-PAGE and transfer
of proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher
and Schuell), probing and detection of specific proteins
was accomplished with indicated antibodies and ECL as
described [63].

mRNA analysis of human glioblastoma and
normal brain tissue biopsies
PINCH1, ILK and ILKAP mRNA analysis was
performed as recently published [19, 62]. Data were
obtained from the Oncomine database (www.oncomine.
org). The expression values of the different studies
(Supplementary Table S1) were first normalized to the
median of the expression levels in normal brain tissue.
Distribution, expression and statistics were calculated
from pooled data using R software version 3.1.0. For
comparison, the Welch’s t-test adaptation was used.

BrdU staining
To analyze the effect of PINCH1, ILK and ILKAP
on cell cycle, the percentage of S-phase cells was
determined after knockdown. Before fixation with 3%
formaldehyde, cells were incubated with 10 μM BrdU
for 10 min. After permeabilization with 0.25% Triton
X-100/PBS for 10 min, preparation of samples with
1N HCl and 2N HCl for 10 min and blocking with 1%
BSA/PBS, BrdU and Nuclei staining was accomplished
with specific antibodies and Vectashield/DAPI mounting
medium. Images were obtained with an Axioscope 2plus
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss).

siRNA transfection
PINCH1 siRNA (sequence: 5′-GGACCUAUAUG
AAUGGUUUtt-3′), ILK siRNA (sequence: 5′-GGGCAAU
GACAUUGUCGUGtt-3′), ILKAP siRNA (sequence:
5′-GGUUCUCUUGCCACAUCAAtt-3′), p53 siRNA
(sequence:
5′-GGGUUAGUUUACAAUCAGCtt-3′),
DNAPK siRNA (sequence: 5′- GGCAAUUCGUC
CUCAGAUUtt-3′) and ATM siRNA (sequence: 5′-GG
CACAAAAUGUGAAAUUCtt-3′) were obtained from
Applied Biosystems (Darmstadt, Germany) and the
non-specific control siRNA (sequence: 5′-GCAGC
UAUAUGAAUGUUGUtt-3′) from MWG (Ebersberg,
Germany). SiRNA delivery was performed as published
[19].Twenty-four hours after transfection with
oligofectamine and 20 nM siRNA under serum-free
conditions, cells were plated for colony formation assays,
immunofluorescence staining or protein lysates.

Immunofluorescence staining
For localization of integrin-associated proteins,
immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously
described [19]. Cells were cultured for 24 h, fixed with
1% formaldehyde/PBS and permeabilized with 0.25%
Triton X-100/PBS. Staining was performed with specific
primary antibodies and fluorescence-labeled secondary
antibodies. Nuclei were stained with Vectashield/DAPI
mounting medium. Representative immunofluorescence
images were obtained using a Laser Scanning Microscope
LSM510 meta (Zeiss).

Colony formation assay
The colony formation assay was used to measure
clonogenic cell survival and performed as recently

reached. Densitometry of Western blots was performed by
scanning of the exposed film and using ImageJ analysis
software (http://www.nih.gov).

The coding sequence of the human ILKAP gene
was amplified by PCR from cDNA generated from
human placental mRNA using specific primers (Fw:
5′-GGGGTACCATGGACC TCTTCGGGGACCTG -3′;
Rev: 5′-CGGGATCC CGGTGGGGTATCCGCACC
ACCAT-3′) and cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector
(Invitrogen) after restriction with KpnI and BamHI.
Transient transfection was performed as published using
Lipofectamine [19]. In brief, cells were plated 24 h prior
to transfection. Plasmid and lipofectamine were incubated
for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed 5 h
after transfection. Immunofluorescence images were
obtained with a Laser Scanning Microscope LSM510
meta.

γH2AX/53BP1 assay
To provide further mechanistic insight into the
enhanced radiosensitivity after PINCH1, ILK and
ILKAP silencing, we measured residual DNA-double
strand breaks (rDSB) by using the foci assay. As
previously published [63], rDSBs were visualized by
double staining of phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) plus
p53 binding protein-1 (53BP1). Cells were fixed with
1% formaldehyde/PBS at 24 h after X-ray irradiation
(0 or 6 Gy). Permeabilization with 0.25% Triton X-100/
PBS preceded staining with specific anti-γH2AX and
anti-53BP1 antibodies and Vectashield/DAPI mounting
medium. γH2AX/53BP1-positive nuclear foci of at
least 150 cells from three independent experiments
were counted microscopically with an Axioscope 2plus
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) and defined as rDSBs.

Protein fractionation
The Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for
Cultured Cells (Pierce) was used according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and as published [64]. In brief,
24 h after plating cells were irradiated with 6 Gy or left
unirradiated. At different time points after irradiation, cell
lysis and fractionation were conducted. Equal loading
was ensured by total protein concentration measurement
using the BCA assay (Pierce). Fractionation efficacy was
confirmed with detection of β1 integrin for the membrane
fraction and Histone H3 for the nuclear fraction.
