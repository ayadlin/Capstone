BACKGROUND: The objective of this secondary analysis was to identify patients with selected stage IIIB/IV nonsmall
cell lung carcinoma and good performance status who were at high risk for requiring subsequent palliative thoracic
radiotherapy after initial treatment with first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: The authors conducted a pooled analysis
of patients at a single institution who enrolled onto 10 prospective phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that involved first-line,
platinum-based chemotherapy. Baseline lung-related characteristics before trial enrollment were analyzed as possible
prognostic factors for freedom from pulmonary events (defined either as subsequent thoracic radiation or as a new
collapsed lung, which is an indication for thoracic radiation). RESULTS: Of 244 consecutive patients who were
reviewed, 42 patients received a palliative course of thoracic radiation, 40 exhibited evidence of new lobar collapse
on follow-up chest imaging, and 14 received thoracic radiation for lobar collapse. On univariable analysis, pulmonary
symptoms (P ¼ .043) or pneumonia at presentation (P ¼ .0001), increasing size of hilar disease (P < .0001), and evidence of obstruction of major bronchi or vessels (P ¼ .0003) were associated with subsequent pulmonary events. On
multivariable analysis, hilar disease measuring >3 cm (hazard ratio, 1.8; P ¼ .003) and prechemotherapy pneumonia
(hazard ratio, 2.1; P ¼ .009) were associated with pulmonary events; patients who had both risk factors or hilar disease >5 cm in greatest dimension exhibited a >50% risk of subsequent events. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with bulky
hilar disease and a history of pneumonia at presentation were at high risk for requiring palliative thoracic radiation.

INTRODUCTION
For patients with selected stage IIIB or IV nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), palliative chemotherapy as initial
therapy has demonstrated improvements in overall survival and quality of life in multiple randomized clinical trials compared with supportive care alone.1,2 For patients with a good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(ECOG PS) (0 or 1), the standard of care for most patients consists of a platinum doublet regimen for 4 to 6 cycles followed by either maintenance or immediate second-line chemotherapy3-6 or delayed second-line chemotherapy at the time
of progression.7-10
Palliative thoracic radiotherapy (RT) usually is reserved for patients who develop significant pulmonary symptoms,
such as dyspnea, hemoptysis, cough, or chest pain, or for patients who exhibit radiographic signs of bronchial obstruction
and parenchymal lobar collapse.11-15 A course of thoracic RT can be delivered at diagnosis or at the time of symptomatic
or radiographic progression.14 Although thoracic RT is efficacious in alleviating symptoms,11-14 to our knowledge, no
modern randomized trial has been conducted comparing thoracic RT versus supportive care alone for patients with

The objectives of the current study were to examine
the clinical and radiographic factors available at diagnosis
for patients with advanced stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to identify predictive factors for subsequent pulmonary events
(defined as receipt of palliative thoracic RT or development of lobar collapse on follow-up imaging, which is an
indication for palliative thoracic RT). The ultimate goal is
to define a subgroup of patients in whom early thoracic
RT may be of benefit before severe pulmonary symptoms
or collapsed lung parenchyma arise. We performed a
pooled analysis of patients who received treatment on 11
prospective trials at a single institution involving first-line,
platinum-based chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
This study was an institutional review board-approved,
pooled analysis of previously conducted clinical trials in
which patients were enrolled and treated at the University
of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer
Center. All patients who received treatment between the
years 1997 and 2010 who met the following criteria were
included in this study: 1) new diagnosis of advanced stage
IIIB or IV NSCLC; 2) enrollment onto a prospective,
phase 2 or 3 trial involving first-line, platinum-based
chemotherapy for patients with high performance status
(ECOG PS 0 or 1); 3) no prior thoracic surgery or RT;
and 4) available prechemotherapy chest computed tomography (CT). For a list of the 10 trials that were included
in this study, see Table 1. Of 318 patients identified, 2
were excluded from the analysis because no follow-up information was available. Patients who developed

metastatic disease after previous thoracic surgery (27
patients) or radical RT (10 patients) for stage I, III, or III
NSCLC were eligible for enrollment onto some of the
included trials but were excluded from our analysis,
because previous treatment may affect the ability to receive
subsequent palliative RT. Sixteen patients received palliative thoracic RT immediately before enrollment onto a
trial and, thus, were excluded; and 31 patients did not
have available chest CT scans and were excluded. In total,
244 patients met all criteria for the current analysis.
Data Collection
Baseline clinical data

Patient demographic information, the date of study
enrollment, and the date of either death or last clinical follow-up were obtained through the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center clinical trial databases and publicly
available resources. Clinical stage was consistently redefined
using the American Joint Committee on Cancer seventh
edition guidelines17 and was obtained through a review of
history and physical examination records and imaging
reports. Symptoms reported on the pretrial history and
physical examinations were recorded, including new cough
(chronic cough not scored), hemoptysis, chest pain, and
dyspnea above baseline (chronic dyspnea not scored). Pneumonia was defined by the prescription of antibiotics for pulmonary-related symptoms (cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis,
chest pain) within 60 days before enrollment (See Table 2).
Baseline radiographic data

For all 244 patients, chest CT scans were obtained
within 6 weeks of trial enrollment and were reviewed and
reported by the University of North Carolina Department
of Radiology. Of the 244 scans, 231 (95%) were contrast
enhanced. The CT reports were reviewed to collect information regarding the presence or absence of hilar disease
(defined as hilar nodes or masses that originate from the parenchyma or mediastinum and extend into the hilum, as
described in the reports) and the size of hilar disease as estimated by the maximum dimension in the axial plane.
Bronchial/vascular compression was defined as the narrowing, obstruction, or obliteration of the trachea or mainstem,
lobar, or segmental bronchi or major vessels. The presence
or absence of any atelectasis, atelectasis of 1 or more lobe,
and pleural effusion also was noted (See Table 3).

lapsed lobe on follow-up chest imaging. Any course of
palliative radiation targeted toward disease in the lung parenchyma, hila, or mediastinum that was delivered after the date
of enrollment onto trial was scored as a pulmonary event.
The reports of all chest CT scans and chest x-rays
were reviewed. A collapsed lobe was defined as any new
atelectasis after enrollment of more than half of the parenchyma in a lobe as described in the CT reports and confirmed by a second review of the images by the first author
(D.S.H.). Atelectasis caused by either central bronchial
obstruction or compressive pleural effusion was scored
without distinction, because, in a minority of cases (2 of
40), such a distinction was unclear. If a patient manifested

atelectasis of a whole lobe before the date of enrollment,
then the development of a separate, new collapsed lobe
was required to be scored as a pulmonary event.
Statistical Analysis
Freedom from pulmonary events was defined as the interval between the date of trial enrollment and the date of
first pulmonary event. If a patient received thoracic RT
and developed a collapsed lobe, then only the first event
was scored. By using the method of Kaplan and Meier,18
patients were censored from the analysis if they died, were
lost to follow-up, or were alive as of September 1, 2010
with no pulmonary event scored. We hypothesized that
baseline lung-related factors, such as disease stage (IIIB,
IVA, IVB), the presence and size of hilar disease, bronchial/vascular compression, atelectasis, malignant pleural
effusions, pulmonary symptoms, and pneumonia, may be
associated with pulmonary events.
Univariable analyses of freedom from pulmonary
events were conducted using a log-rank test for categorical
variables and Cox proportional hazards regression for continuous variables. All factors that demonstrated a significance level of P < .1 in univariable analyses were included
in multivariable analysis using Cox proportional hazards
regression. All statistical calculations were conducted with
STATA version 11 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The median age of the study population was 60 years
(range, 23-86 years), and 242 patients (99%) had an
ECOG PS 0 or 1 (see Table 2). In total, 231 patients
(95%) received doublet or triplet, carboplatin-based
chemotherapy; 36 patients (15%) received bevacizumab
in addition to carboplatin; and 13 patients (5%) who
were light smokers or never smokers with adenocarcinoma
received chemotherapy with erlotinib only (see Table 1).
At the time of this analysis, 220 patients (90%) had died,
21 patients (9%) were alive with a median follow-up of
12.1 months (range, 4.3-54.3 months), and 3 patients
(1%) were lost to follow-up after a median of 20.1 months
(range, 0.3-40.0 months). The median survival for all
patients was 7.7 months after the date of trial enrollment.
In total, 234 patients (96%) had subsequent follow-up
chest imaging studies available after trial enrollment, with
a median of 3 CT scans (range, 0-31 CT scans).
Pulmonary Events
In total, 68 patients (28%) developed a pulmonary event:

oped lobar collapse (14 of whom also received thoracic
RT). Patients received palliative thoracic RT a median of
5.6 months (range, 0.2-34.6 months) after enrolling onto
a first-line chemotherapy trial. Approximately 80% of
palliative thoracic RT courses were targeted to obstructing
central mediastinal or hilar disease. Thirteen patients
(31%) did not finish their initially prescribed course of
RT because of declining overall functional status and
moved toward supportive care only. The reasons for
decline were progressive pulmonary distress (11 patients),
progressive fatigue (1 patient), and mental status changes
(1 patient). The median survival after a course of palliative
thoracic RT was 2.9 months (range, 0.3-19.3 months).
Lobar collapse was identified on follow-up imaging
a median of 5.6 months (range, 0.06-40.7 months) from
trial enrollment and a median of 24 days before death
(range, 0-6.8 months). Two of the 40 collapsed lungs
(5%) were caused by compressive atelectasis from pleural
effusions, 36 (90%) were caused by central obstruction,
and, in 2 patients (5%), the distinction was unclear.
On univariable analysis, the size of hilar disease at
baseline; the presence of bronchial/vascular compression,
cough, or any pulmonary symptoms; pneumonia, and
whole lobe atelectasis were associated significantly with
subsequent pulmonary events (Table 4). On multivariable
analysis, the size of hilar disease (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30;
P < .0001) and pneumonia (HR, 2.30; P ¼ .0004)
remained significant (see Table 4 and Figure 1).
In separate sensitivity analyses of thoracic RT and lobar collapse, the size of hilar disease and pneumonia
remained the only 2 significantly predictive factors on multivariable analyses. For thoracic RT (42 events), both the size
of hilar disease (HR, 1.19; P ¼ .018) and pneumonia (HR,
2.24; P ¼ .015) were significant; whereas, for lobar collapse
(40 events), the size of hilar disease size (HR, 1.26; P <
.0001) was the only significant factor. In a sensitivity analysis
that included all consecutive patients (N ¼ 316), even those
who had received prior thoracic RT or surgery for earlier
stage disease, the size of hilar disease (HR, 1.24; P < .0001)
and prechemotherapy pneumonia (HR, 2.07; P ¼ .005)
again were the 2 significant factors on multivariable analysis.
Risk Groups
We examined the risk of pulmonary events by patient
groups with zero, 1, or 2 risk factors identified in multivariable analysis (the size of hilar disease and prechemotherapy pneumonia). For this analysis, hilar disease size
was dichotomized by the median disease size in the patient
cohort (3 cm) for clinical convenience. The cumulative

incidence of pulmonary events for the 3 groups was 20%
(0 factors), 30% (1 factor), and 60% (2 factors); and median survival also differed between the 3 groups (11.3
months, 7.0 months, and 4.7 months, respectively; logrank P ¼ .0001) (See Figure 2). These low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups constitute 53%, 36%,
and 11% of the population, respectively.

DISCUSSION
The standard treatment for most patients with advanced
stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and a good performance status is
platinum-based chemotherapy.1,2 Local treatment (either
RT or endobronchial debulking) is not given commonly
upfront but, instead, is given at the time of pulmonary
symptom development or when follow-up chest imaging
studies suggest lung collapse.11-14 Several randomized trials support the use of immediate3,6 or delayed,8,19 secondline, systemic therapy, leaving the role and timing of thoracic RT less defined. Thus, the objective of our study was
to increase understanding of which patients are at the
greatest risk for requiring thoracic RT after receiving firstline systemic therapy. In these patients, the role of early
thoracic RT could be studied to determine whether there
is a quality-of-life benefit for RT delivered before pulmonary collapse and/or severe pulmonary symptoms arise.
We observed that 20% of our cohort developed pulmonary events at a median of 5.6 months after initiating

2748

chemotherapy. The median survival after a collapsed lobe
was only 24 days; and, of the 40 patients who developed
collapsed lobes, only 14 (35%) received thoracic RT or
other local therapy to the lung. Of those patients who
received thoracic RT, 31% were unable to complete a
course of palliative RT because of declining overall functional status. These figures underscore the difficulty in
providing a course of thoracic RT at the time of pulmonary distress and/or lung collapse.
The size of hilar disease and pneumonia at baseline
were associated significantly with pulmonary events. Clinically, increasing size of central hilar disease can lead to
increased risk for future bronchial obstruction, lobar collapse, and pulmonary symptoms. Baseline prechemotherapy pneumonia may signify a predilection for future
postobstructive infections. In our cohort, patients with
both risk factors had a 60% cumulative incidence of
events. We estimate that the actual number of pulmonary
events in this population could be even higher, because
many patients in our cohort, choosing supportive care
measures, appropriately did not receive follow-up chest
imaging in the few months before death, and additional
patients may have received palliative thoracic RT at other
institutions without our knowledge.
Our observation that 31% of patients could not complete a course of palliative thoracic RT is analogous to published findings for systemic therapy. Among the patients
who complete first-line chemotherapy, only 60% to 70%
receive second-line chemotherapy at the time of progression, in part because of performance status declines.4-6,20
Because progressive disease and the development of collapsed lung often are associated with a decline in overall
functional status, these findings suggest that early thoracic
RT may be beneficial, especially in patients at high risk of
developing pulmonary events. Reducing the risk of collapsed lung and/or severe pulmonary symptoms through
early thoracic RT may have a quality-of-life benefit by
delaying a decline in functional status and thereby reducing
a barrier to completion of necessary systemic therapy. In
addition, lung collapse caused by central obstruction can
be a fatal event–the median survival after collapse of 1 or
more lobes in our series was only 24 days. Delaying or preventing its occurrence with early thoracic RT may improve
survival in selected patients. These outcomes can be studied
in a prospective trial.
The median time to pulmonary event of 5.6
months suggests that early thoracic RT could be interdigitated with first-line chemotherapy or could be delivered soon afterward to minimize interference with

planned systemic therapy. Only patients at high risk for
pulmonary events should be selected for early RT,
because 1 randomized trial conducted without systemic
therapy indicated that immediate palliative RT was not
necessary for all asymptomatic patients.21 In that study,
asymptomatic patients were randomized between immediate and delayed thoracic RT when needed to control
symptoms. In the delayed group, 42% of patients
required thoracic RT at a median of 4 months after trial
enrollment, and only 1% of patients received cytotoxic
chemotherapy. In our cohort, fewer patients seemed to
need RT (28%) at a longer time interval from enrollment (5.6 months), perhaps reflecting the efficacy of
first-line systemic therapy. In a secondary analysis of
another randomized trial comparing 3 dose and fractio-

nation schedules for immediate thoracic RT, those with
symptomatic disease had worse overall survival compared
with minimally symptomatic patients (6.0 months vs
11.8 months).22 Quality-of-life scores for both groups
(symptomatic and minimally symptomatic) deteriorated
over time, whereas transient esophagitis increased in
both groups, leading the authors to recommend delayed
RT at the time when significant pulmonary symptoms
develop.1 Thus, these prior studies suggest that early thoracic RT should be studied prospectively only in a
selected group of patients whose baseline clinical and radiographic characteristics suggest a high likelihood of the
need for delayed RT after first-line systemic therapy.
The current study has several limitations, including
its retrospective design and its analysis of a single

institution. The patients were drawn from patients
accrued over 13 years; thus, there may be stage migration
because of the use of positron emission tomography and
improvements in radiation treatment delivery with 3dimensional CT planning. Our results require validation
by others. The strengths of this study include the patient
cohort, which was drawn from prospective trials of chemotherapy and, thus, had relatively complete follow-up and
repeated chest imaging. Furthermore, to our knowledge,
this study is the first to identify a subgroup of patients
with advanced NSCLC and good performance status who
are at high risk of developing pulmonary events after firstline chemotherapy. The potential benefit of early thoracic
RT in this group of patients should be studied
prospectively.
