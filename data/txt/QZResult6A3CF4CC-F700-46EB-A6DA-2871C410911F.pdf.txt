Abstract
Growing evidence shows that cancer cells use mRNA-binding
proteins and miRNAs to posttranscriptionally regulate signaling
pathways to adapt to harsh tumor microenvironments. In ovarian
cancer, cytoplasmic accumulation of mRNA-binding protein HuR
(ELAVL1) is associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we
observed high HuR expression in ovarian cancer cells compared
with ovarian primary cells, providing a rationale for targeting
HuR. RNAi-mediated silencing of HuR in ovarian cancer cells
signiﬁcantly decreased cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, and impaired migration and invasion. In addition,
HuR-depleted human ovarian xenografts were smaller than control tumors. A biodistribution study showed effective tumortargeting by a novel Cy3-labeled folic acid (FA)-derivatized DNA

dendrimer nanocarrier (3DNA). We combined siRNAs against
HuR with FA-3DNA and found that systemic administration of
the resultant FA-3DNA-siHuR conjugates to ovarian tumor–
bearing mice suppressed tumor growth and ascites development, signiﬁcantly prolonging lifespan. NanoString gene expression analysis identiﬁed multiple HuR-regulated genes that function in many essential cellular and molecular pathways, an
attractive feature of candidate therapeutic targets. Taken together, these results are the ﬁrst to demonstrate the versatility of the
3DNA nanocarrier for in vivo–targeted delivery of a cancer
therapeutic and support further preclinical investigation of this
system adapted to siHuR-targeted therapy for ovarian cancer.

Introduction

effective therapeutic strategy is clearly needed to treat this deadly
cancer.
Gene dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer. Cancer cells acquire
a unique gene expression proﬁle to continue to proliferate and
survive the harsh tumor microenvironment. Unlike genetic modiﬁcation that usually takes years to achieve, cancer cells adopt a
more rapid and efﬁcient way to alter gene expression through
regulation of transcribed mRNAs (2–4). Posttranscriptional regulation (i.e., modiﬁcation of mRNA stability and/or translational
efﬁciency) is achieved through a tightly controlled network of
interactions between speciﬁc target mRNAs with transacting miRNAs and/or RNA-binding proteins (5–7). By regulating these
interactions, cancer cells rapidly alter the stability and/or translational efﬁciency of a large subset of mRNAs that encode protooncogenes, cytokines, cell-cycle regulators, and other regulatory
proteins that promote cancer cell survival and tumor progression
(8–11).
HuR (human antigen R, aka ELAVL1) is a ubiquitously
expressed RNA-binding protein that is highly expressed in many
ovarian tumors (12, 13). HuR functions in normal, healthy cells as
a critical molecule involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation. When cells are stressed (e.g., by low oxygen levels), HuR
binds to AREs, AU-rich RNA elements typically located in 30 untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNAs, and potently inﬂuences
translation of key survival and growth-related mRNAs in the
cytoplasm by several mechanisms including active transport of
mRNAs out of the nucleus, mRNA stabilization, and direct facilitation of translation. The role of HuR in the stress response is
most likely part of a survival mechanism used by the most
aggressive cancer cells in a tumor (14–16). High cytoplasmic

Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer
in the United States. It has been perceived as a silent killer due to
its asymptomatic nature during the early stages of disease progression. Ovarian cancers are classiﬁed into a number of different
subtypes depending on cellular origin and histologic characteristics, epithelial ovarian cancer being by far the most common
type (1). The current clinical regimen for treating ovarian carcinoma is typically surgical debulking followed by chemotherapy
with paclitaxel and a platinum-based therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin). Although 80% of patients receiving this treatment have an
initial favorable response, most tumors will eventually relapse
accompanied by the development of chemoresistance. A more

HuR expression correlates with high histologic grade of ovarian
cancer and poor prognosis in serous ovarian cancer (12, 17).
Identiﬁcation and targeted inhibition of a single protein
involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression is one strategy
to treat ovarian cancer (18). The role of HuR in posttranscriptional
regulation of multiple genes that promote survival of ovarian
tumor cells provides an opportunity to develop an alternative
strategy that targets multiple core signaling pathways at once.
Indeed, proof-of-concept studies using HuR knockout mice and
intracranial injection of mice with genetically silenced HuR primary glioblastoma cells have shown a reduction in colon tumor
and glioblastoma growth, respectively (19, 20). One approach to
inhibit HuR is through targeted delivery of functional siRNA. We
have recently reported suppression of pancreatic xenograft growth
in mice following direct injection of tumors with a nanoparticledelivered siHuR (21). Targeting systemically administered siRNAbased therapies to tumor cells, however, has been challenging. To
address this challenge, in this study, we use a novel DNA dendrimer nanocarrier, 3DNA, derivatized with folic acid (FA) for
systemic administration to target siHuR delivery to tumors in
mice bearing ovarian tumors that have high cell surface expression
of folate receptor-a.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, transfection, and viability assay
A2780 cells (T. Hamilton, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, obtained in 2004) and OVCAR-5 cells (A. Klein-Szanto,
Fox Chase Cancer Center, obtained in 2013) were authenticated
and maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Cellgro) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Gemini) at 37 C in 5% CO2. OVCAR3 cells,
purchased from ATCC, were grown in media as recommended
by ATCC. ID8 cells (K. Roby, University of Kansas Medical Center,
Kansas City, KS, obtained in 2006), stably transfected with CAG/
ﬁreﬂy luciferase (22), were authenticated and maintained as
described previously (23). Frozen aliquots of cells were prepared
upon receipt. All cells were used within 6 months of testing
negative for mycoplasma using a PCR kit (Sigma). Cells were
transiently transfected with siHuR (Ambion #4407268) using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Viable cell number was determined using EZ Count Kit (Lankenau Development, Inc.).
Immunoblotting
Whole-cell extracts were prepared in RIPA buffer containing
proteinase inhibitors. Extract protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Soluble proteins
were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western
blotting using HuR mAb clone 3A2 (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or GAPDH mAb clone 5C6 (1:8,000; Ambion), and
a secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase–labeled goat antimouse (1:8,000, Thermo Scientiﬁc). Membranes were developed
with ECL (Pierce).
Immunostaining
Four-micron sections of ﬁxed tumors were deparafﬁnized,
antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer, and endogenous peroxidase was quenched. Sections were incubated with
primary antibody overnight at 4 C [HuR mAb 19F12 (1:5,000;
Clonegene); rabbit anti-Ki-67 (1:150; Zymed)] and then with
biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature. Signal was ampliﬁed and visualized using the TSA-Plus
Fluorescence System (Perkin Elmer) or avidin/biotin complex

system (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) followed
by DAB visualization and hematoxylin counterstaining. Sections
were viewed with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope.
HuR knockdown cell line generation
HuR stable knockdown cell lines. To generate shHuR- or shControl
(shCtrl)-expressing lentiviruses, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
was used to transfect 293T cells for 24 hours with plasmids
including a HuR shRNA lentiviral construct (called shHuRc257;
"c" for constitutive) or a control shRNA construct (A. Ristim€aki,
University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; ref. 24), packaging
plasmids (pRSV-Rev and pMDLg/pRRE), and a VSVG-coding
envelope vector (J. Azizkhan-Clifford, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA). Transfection mixture was replaced with fresh cell
growth medium (DMEM þ 10% FBS). Forty-eight hours after
transfection, supernatant was collected, sterile-ﬁltered, and used
to infect A2780 and OVCAR5 cells in medium containing 8 mg/mL
polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following viral infection,
shHuRc257- or shCtrl-expressing cells were selected in medium
containing hygromycin B (Gemini).
Doxycycline-inducible HuR knockdown cell lines. To generate
shRNA-expressing plasmids, two DNA oligonucleotides encoding
shRNA targeting different human HuR sites (referred to as
shHuRi289 and shHuRi699; "i" for inducible; Integrated DNA
Technologies) were cloned into Tet-pLKO-puro lentiviral plasmid
(J. Azizkhan-Clifford, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA) as
described by Wiederschain and colleagues (25). Final shHuR
plasmid constructs were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing. Targeted
sense sequences were: shHuRi289 ¼ 50 -GCAGCAUUGGUGAAGUUGAAUCU-30 ; shHuRi699 ¼ 50 -GCCCAUCACAGUGAAGUUUGCA-30 . To generate OVCAR3 doxycycline-inducible cells,
OVCAR3 cells were infected with shHuRi289- or shHuRi699expressing lentivirus in medium containing 8 mg/mL polybrene
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After viral infection, shHuR- or
shCtrl-expressing cells were selected in medium containing 1
mg/mL puromycin dihydrochloride (Gemini).
In vitro scratch assay, soft agar colony formation, and invasion
assay
A total of 7.5  105 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates to
ensure 100% conﬂuent growth the next day. The cell monolayer
was scratched with a p200 pipet tip, then rinsed with DPBS to
remove debris, followed by addition of fresh culture medium
containing 5% FBS. Sixteen hours later, photographs of the
scratches were taken. The mean width of each scratch was
measured.
The soft agar assay was performed as described previously (26).
Matrigel invasion was performed using Corning's Cell Invasion
Assay protocol as described previously (21).
Cell injection to generate tumors
To generate xenografts, 2  106 OVCAR5-shHuR or OVCAR5shCtrl cells suspended in 100-mL PBS containing 20% cold
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected subcutaneously in the
ﬂank of 8-week-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan). Once a
week, calipers were used to measure tumor length (L) and
width (W), and tumor volumes were estimated by the formula
V ¼ (L  W2)  0.52.
To generate tumors in the peritoneum, 6- to 8-week-old
female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) were injected

intraperitoneally with 2  106 ID8-Fluc cells in 200-mL DMEM
containing no supplements. To assess tumor growth, mice were
optically imaged using an IVIS 100 series Bioluminescence Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences), as described previously, with a
5-minute integration time for image acquisition (22). Luciferase
activity, a measure of tumor load, was quantiﬁed as relative light
units (RLU).
3DNA-siHuR formulations and administration
Dendrimer production. Two-layer 3DNA nanocarriers (Genisphere) were prepared having 2 unique single stranded sequences
(arms) presented on the outer surface as described previously (27,
28). The diameter, determined by DLS, was 70 nm and the zeta
potential was 28  2 meV. FA-targeted 3DNA reagents were
prepared by ﬁrst conjugating FA to an oligonucleotide having
complementarity to one of the 2 single-stranded sequences on the
surface of the 3DNA and hybridizing this FA-modiﬁed oligonucleotide to 3DNA nanocarrier to achieve a ﬁnal ratio of 6 FA
molecules per 3DNA molecule. FA-targeted 3DNA or untargeted
3DNA was combined with either a Cy3 (GE Healthcare) labeled
oligonucleotide complementary to the second outer surface
3DNA, or a modiﬁed siHuR [Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)]
or control siRNA (IDT), complementary to the second outer
surface oligo to prepare ﬂuorescent-tagged or silencing reagents,
respectively. Both the siHuR and control silencing sequences had a
31 nucleotide extension added to the 50 -end of the sense strand as
well as base modiﬁcations (20 o-methyl C, 20 ﬂuoro G, 20 ﬂuoro A,
and phosphorothiolate bonds) to enhance stability against nuclease digestion and minimize immunogenicity. The ﬁnal molecular
ratio of siRNA to 3DNA was 18:1. The siHuR(mouse) sense
sequence is: 50 - GCCUGUUCAGCAGCAUUGGdTdT-30 ; and the
siHuR(human) sense sequence is: 50 -GCGUUUAUCCGGUUUGACAdTdT-30 .
Administration to mice. For efﬁcacy and life span studies, 3DNA
formulations were administered in a blinded fashion to mice
bearing ID8-Fluc tumors by intraperitoneal injection (bi-weekly
 4; 100 mL; 3 mg ds siHuR/injection). Mice were optically imaged
once a week. Four criteria deﬁned life span endpoints: (i) >20%
body weight loss from the pretreatment weight; (ii) ascites development; (iii) physical signs of distress; and (iv) unknown death.
For biodistribution analysis, mice were administered FA3DNA-Cy3 (intravenous injection, 100 mL) and sacriﬁced 24
hours later. Multiple tissues were collected, ﬁxed, and processed
for parafﬁn sectioning. Sections were examined for ﬂuorescence
and representative ﬁelds were photographed using a Nikon E800
Eclipse microscope equipped with Image Pro Plus software and
Evolution camera.
All procedures performed on mice in this study were done in
accordance with the protocols approved by the Lankenau Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Apoptosis
Apoptotic cells were identiﬁed by terminal deoxynucleotide
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using an In Situ
Detection Kit (Roche Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously (29).
Gene expression analysis
To identify cancer-related transcripts that were differentially
expressed between A2780 cells transfected with siHuR or control

www.aacrjournals.org

siRNA, 200 ng of total RNA for each sample, isolated using a
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), was analyzed with nCounter GX
Human Cancer Reference Kit (NanoString Technologies). Negative control probes were used to determine genes reliably detected.
Statistically signiﬁcant differences in gene expression were determined using Student t test (P < 0.05). Principal component
analysis (PCA) was performed using the top 4 components, which
accounted for >99% of the variance. Genes found to contain at
least one ARE site in previous PARalyzer analysis of four HEK293
cell PAR-CLIP libraries were used to identify HuR targets (30). All
analyses were performed in R using FactoMineR for the PCA,
pHeatmap for hierarchical clustering, and heatmap analysis and
ggplot2 for the scatterplots.
Statistical analysis
Survival distributions were estimated using the Kaplan–
Meier method, and treatment groups were compared using the
log-rank test. Pairwise comparison adjustments were made
using the Dunnett–Hsu method. Statistical signiﬁcance of differences in tumor growth rates were determined by a multivariate repeated measures ANOVA and differences in tumor mass
were determined using Student t test. Analysis was performed
using SAS 9.2 or later.

Results
Elevated HuR expression in ovarian tumor cell lines and tissues
To date, studies in ovarian cancer have shown that cytoplasmic
HuR accumulation correlates with poor disease progression, HuR
expression is high across different grades of ovarian cancer, and
strong nuclear HuR staining is often found in high-grade ovarian
carcinoma (13, 17). Few comparisons of HuR expression in
normal ovary and ovarian tumors have been made (12). Here,
we analyzed and compared HuR expression levels between ovarian cancer and primary cell lines as well as between 5 normal
ovaries and 31 serous ovarian tumors. In a Western blot analysis,
we found that all ovarian cancer cells tested (A2780, OVCAR3,
OVCAR5, and OVCA420) express higher levels of HuR (2–6 fold)
compared with ovarian primary cells (HIO80 and HIO120; Fig.
1A). Immunostaining human ovarian tumors for HuR revealed
cytoplasmic HuR expression in 29 of 31 tumors. Nuclear expression was high in the same 29 tumors (two tumors had no nuclear
and cytoplasmic HuR expression). In contrast, normal ovary
specimens had low nuclear HuR expression relative to tumors
and no cytoplasmic HuR (Fig. 1B), in agreement with the observations by Denkert and colleagues of HuR expression and localization in three normal ovaries (12). These results suggest that
HuR may be a good therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian
cancer.
In vitro suppression of HuR expression reduces ovarian cancer
cell growth
To study the effect of HuR on ovarian cancer cell growth, we
took three approaches to knock down HuR expression in vitro,
each targeting a different location in the HuR coding sequence:
transient transfection of siRNA (siHuR) or stable expression
(inducible and constitutive) of shRNAs (shHuR; see Supplementary Fig. S1 for targeted HuR sequences). First, we directly transfected A2780 ovarian cancer cells with siHuR615. HuR suppression was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis and immunostaining
(Fig. 2A). HuR mRNA was signiﬁcantly reduced as well in siHuRtransfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We assessed cell

inhibition resulted in a 32% reduction in viable cells 72 hours
after transfection as compared with cells transfected with control
siRNA (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A).

To further investigate the function of HuR in cell proliferation,
we utilized a lentiviral gene transduction system to generate
ovarian cell lines that stably express shRNAs targeting HuR mRNA.
First, we generated A2780 and OVCAR5 cell lines that stably and
constitutively express either shHuRc or shCtrl. HuR protein

expression was effectively silenced in a sustained way in shHuRcexpressing cells, whereas HuR expression remains at the parental
cell level in shCtrl-expressing cells in both early and later passages
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2B). HuR mRNA levels were also
reduced 7-fold in shHuRc-expressing cells (P < 0.0005; Supplementary Fig. S2C). The number of A2780 and OVCAR5 cells was
decreased 19% and 39% (compared with parental lines), respectively, in shHuRc-expressing cells when assayed at 72 hours after
the cells were plated (P < 0.05; Fig. 2B).
We also generated two OVCAR3 cell lines that stably express
two distinct doxycycline-inducible HuR-targeted shRNAs, shHuRi
289 and shHuRi699. We detected a 25% and 7% decrease in
cell number of OVCAR3-shHuRi289 and OVCAR3-shHuRi699,
respectively, at 120 hours after doxycycline treatment (Fig. 2C).
Signiﬁcant suppression of HuR protein and mRNA was detected
in both cell lines in response to doxycycline treatment (Fig. 2C

and Supplementary Fig. S3A). mRNA knockdown was 53% and
67% in OVCAR3-shHuRi289 and OVCAR3-shHuRi699, respectively (P < 0.005). Protein knockdown reached a maximum of
36% to 64% in both cell lines at 5 days of doxycycline
treatment (1 mg/mL; Fig. 2C). Importantly, doxycycline treatment by itself is not toxic and did not affect OVCAR3 cell
growth (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C). Taken together,
these results demonstrate that inhibition of endogenous HuR
expression compromises the normal proliferation of ovarian
cancer cells.

of cancer cells. To examine whether HuR is required for

anchorage-independent growth of ovarian cancer cells, we
assayed OVCAR5-shHuRc257 and control cells for soft agar
colony formation over a 7-week period (Fig. 3A). HuR suppression resulted in a 58% and 42% decrease in colony number
compared to parental (P < 0.005) and shCtrl-expressing cells
(P < 0.05), respectively.
Cancer cells regulate the expression of a discreet set of genes
to migrate and invade distant sites. HuR has been shown to
affect cell migration through posttranscriptional regulation of
invasion- and metastasis-related genes such as Snail and
MMP-9. High-grade serous carcinomas (type II) metastasize
rapidly and attach to the abdominal peritoneum or omentum
(31). Here, we investigated whether altering HuR expression
affects ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion. First, we
performed in vitro scratch assays with OVCAR5-shHuRc257
cells. We observed a signiﬁcant decrease in the rate at which
OVCAR5-shHuRc257 cells migrated to "repair" the scratched
surface as compared with OVCAR5 and OVCAR5-shCtrl cells.
After 16 hours, closure of the scratch was complete in parental
cells, while closure in siCtrl cells was nearly complete at 91%
and closure in shHuR-expressing cells was only 38% (P ¼
0.0001; Fig. 3B). Next, we performed Matrigel invasion assays
in which cells were seeded in serum-free medium on transwell
inserts coated with Matrigel and incubated for 24 hours with
serum-rich medium in the bottom chambers serving as a
chemoattractant to promote invasion. We observed a significant decrease in the number of OVCAR5-shHuRc257 cells
that had invaded the Matrigel as compared with the number
of invading parental OVCAR5 and OVCAR5-shCtrl cells (58%
and 48% decrease, respectively, P < 0.05; Fig. 3C). Taken
together, these results demonstrate that inhibition of endogenous HuR expression compromises the migration and invasion capabilities of ovarian cancer cells.
HuR inhibition suppresses ovarian xenograft growth
To test the effect of HuR inhibition on the growth of human
ovarian tumor cells in vivo, we injected the hind ﬂank of female
nude mice subcutaneously with equal numbers of either
OVCAR5-shHuRc257 or OVCAR5-shCtrl cells. Three weeks
postinjection, tumors were resected and photographed, and
their volumes measured (Fig. 4). The mean tumor volumes
generated from OVCAR5-shHuRc257 cells were signiﬁcantly
smaller than those from OVCAR5-shCtrl cells (118  21 mm3
vs. 357  63 mm3; P ¼ 0.0004; Fig. 4). Western blot analysis of
total cell lysates prepared from tumors showed a mean reduction of 73% in HuR protein in OVCAR5-shHuRc tumors as
compared with OVCAR5-shCtrl tumors (Fig. 4). We observed
very few apoptotic cells in both OVCAR5-shHuRc and

1554 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

OVCAR5-shCtrl upon TUNEL staining of tumor sections (Supplementary Fig. S4A). We also evaluated whether HuR inhibition affected tumor cell proliferation. Human Ki67 staining
revealed large areas of Ki67 cells in OVCAR5-shHuRc tumors
that were absent in OVCAR5-shCtrl tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S4A), in agreement with our observation that HuR inhibition resulted in a decrease in tumor cell proliferation in vitro
(Fig. 2). To complement the Ki67 staining of xenograft sections, we stained parental, shHuRc, and shCtrl cells with Ki67
in culture. The percent Ki67þ parental cells was 1.4 times
higher than in shHuRc cells (P ¼ 0.003) and 1.2 times higher
than in shCtrl cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). No apoptotic
cells were observed upon TUNEL staining of all cell populations. Taken together, we conclude from these results that
tumors in which HuR is suppressed are smaller than control
tumors largely due to a reduction in cell proliferation rather
than tumor cell death.
FA-derivatized 3DNA platform effectively targets siRNA to
ovarian tumors
To test the therapeutic efﬁcacy of siHuR in a mouse ovarian
tumor model, we conjugated FA to 3DNA nanocarrier for in vivo–
targeted siHuR delivery to tumor cells following systemic delivery
(Supplementary Fig. S5A). The folate receptor has been shown to
be overexpressed on the surface of many tumor cells, including
ovarian cancer (32). We conﬁrmed that ovarian cancer cells
express higher amounts of folate receptor than do ovarian primary
cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). To improve siHuR stability in
serum, we made several modiﬁcations to nucleotide bases (Supplementary Fig. S5C). Importantly, siHuR conjugated to 3DNA
retains its ability to suppress HuR expression; inhibition of HuR
expression following in vitro transfection of A2780 cells with FA3DNA-siHuR is as effective as Lipofectamine-delivered siHuR
(Supplementary Fig. S5D).
To determine how effectively FA targets delivery of 3DNA
to tumor cells, we systemically administered Cy3-labeled
3DNA with or without FA-derivatization to C57BL/6J mice
bearing tumors throughout the peritoneal cavity derived
from murine ID8-Fluc cells. Twenty-four hours after administration, mice were sacriﬁced and multiple tissues and
tumor nodules were collected for ﬂuorescent microscopic
analysis (Supplementary Fig. S6). We observed signiﬁcant
Cy3 ﬂuorescence in ovarian tumors, lesser amount in normal
ovaries of tumor-bearing mice, and very low amounts in
brain, liver, spleen, and lung. No ﬂuorescence was observed

Systemic Tumor-Targeted siHuR Inhibits Ovarian Tumor Growth

FA-derivatized 3DNA tumor-targeted delivery of siHuR
suppresses tumor growth and ascites formation and increases
life span in ID8-Fluc model
To test the therapeutic efﬁcacy of FA-derivatized 3DNA
delivery of siHuR, we used the ID8-Fluc ovarian cancer mouse
model. We intraperitoneally injected C57BL/6J mice with ID8Fluc cells. Tumor load in these mice was assessed using optical
imaging to detect and quantify luciferase bioluminescence as
relative light units (RLU). Baseline optical images were
obtained 4 to 6 weeks after mice were injected with cells. The
total RLU per mouse for baseline images ranged from 5  105
to 1  106 RLU. Mice were distributed into 5 groups having
equivalent tumor loads (n ¼ 6 per group). The treatment
schedule for these mice was 2 intraperitoneal injections of
either FA-3DNA-siHuR, 3DNA-siHuR, FA-3DNA-siCtrl, or
0.9% saline per week for 4 weeks (Fig. 5A). Mice were optically
imaged once a week. Representative optical images of mice in
each group at baseline and at week 4 are shown in Fig. 5A. The
mean tumor loads from each of the ﬁve treatment groups were
determined at week 1, 2, 3, and 4. Suppression of tumor
growth, although not quite signiﬁcant, was observed only in
mice treated with FA-3DNA-siHuR compared with those of
the other groups (Fig. 5A). Ascites ﬂuid accumulation in the

abdomen attenuates the bioluminescence emitted by tumor
cells. Thus, the observed bioluminescence may have resulted in
low assessments of tumor load in the other groups and underestimated the effectiveness of the FA-targeted siHuR treatment
on the suppression of solid tumor growth. Strikingly, only one
of 6 mice treated with FA-3DNA-siHuR developed ascites
compared with the rest of groups in which 67% to 100% of
mice developed ascites (Fig. 5A). Histopathologic analysis of
multiple tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, lung, brain, ovaries, and
heart) from three mice treated with FA-3DNA-siHuR revealed
minimal chronic inﬂammation (data not shown).
In a separate study, we examined whether FA-3DNA-siHuR
treatment of mice bearing ID8-Fluc tumors prolongs life. Mice
were injected twice weekly with the same 4 treatments as in Fig.
5A for 4 weeks. The median survival of FA-3DNA-siHuR–
treated mice is approximately 1.5 times longer than either the
FA-3DNA-siCtrl, or 3DNA only treated mice (43 vs. 29
days; Fig. 5B). The log-rank test of signiﬁcance across the groups
has a P value of <0.001, indicating a signiﬁcant difference across
the four treatment groups in survival. Pairwise comparisons
adjusted using the Dunnett–Hsu method indicate that treatment with FA-3DNA-siCtrl is signiﬁcantly different from FA3DNA-siHuR and 3DNA (P ¼ 0.0007 and P ¼ 0.0093),

respectively, but not signiﬁcantly different from 3DNA-siHuR
(P ¼ 0.305). Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that treatment with
the FA-derivatized 3DNA formulation improved both efﬁcacy
and life span outcomes as compared with the siHuR formulation lacking the FA conjugate.
HuR regulates transcripts that function in multiple cellular
pathways in ovarian cancer cells
To identify genes whose expression is regulated by HuR in
ovarian cancer cells, we used a NanoString nCounter GX
Human Cancer Reference Kit to interrogate 230 genes (plus
6 housekeeping genes) in total RNA from A2780 cells 72 hours
after they had been transfected with siHuR615 or with siCtrl
(see ref. 21 for complete list of the interrogated genes). Four
biologic replicates of each sample were analyzed using multivariate statistics. Both PCA and hierarchical clustering analysis
showed that the transcript proﬁle changed signiﬁcantly after
HuR suppression (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). MO plots
identiﬁed transcripts having signiﬁcantly different expression
after HuR knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S7C). 116 genes
(50%) had signiﬁcantly altered expression; 50 had upregulated
expression and 66 had downregulated expression (Table 1). We
used multiple existing PAR-CLIP datasets from HEK293 (30)
and ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitates from MiaPaca-2
cells (21) to identify those transcripts to which HuR binds
directly, and indirect targets of HuR (i.e., downstream of direct
targets). Thirty-one of 50 (62%) upregulated genes, and 37 of
66 (56%) downregulated genes are direct targets of HuR (Supplementary Fig. S7D; Table 1). Using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to
perform a functional annotation enrichment analysis, we determined that HuR-regulated transcripts with altered expression
were associated with multiple essential processes including cell
proliferation, angiogenesis, cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis,
and DNA repair (Supplementary Table S1).

Discussion
This is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of
targeting HuR for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Our previous
studies in preclinical pancreatic cancer models (33–38), as well as
studies by others (17, 19, 20, 24, 39–41), provided the rationale
for investigating HuR inhibition in ovarian tumors We ﬁrst
established that suppression of HuR expression reduces proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and invasion of ovarian
cancer cells in vitro. We further demonstrate HuR inhibition–
mediated reduction in tumor growth rate, delay in ascites development, and extension of lifespan by nearly 1.5-fold in two
different ovarian cancer mouse models, a xenograft model and
an orthotopic model in which mice bear tumors throughout the
peritoneum.
We used a novel DNA dendrimer nanocarrier, 3DNA, to
target delivery of siHuR directly to the peritoneum of mice
bearing ID8-Fluc tumors. Derivatization of 3DNA with therapeutic payloads (e.g., siRNA, miRNA, DNA, small molecules),
targeting moieties (e.g., antibodies, ligands) and tracking tags
(e.g., ﬂuorescent markers, radionuclides) allows for versatility
in the design of 3DNAs having potential for a wide range of

Systemic Tumor-Targeted siHuR Inhibits Ovarian Tumor Growth

medical applications. The results of this study demonstrate
that systemically administered siHuR delivered by 3DNA
retains the ability to inhibit HuR expression and achieve
desirable therapeutic endpoints.
While HuR acts as a stress-response protein in tumor cells by
regulating the expression of multiple genes known to function in
tumor cell survival, HuR is also expressed at low levels in normal
cells and plays a vital role in these cells as well. HuR functions in
normal cells to stabilize mRNA transcripts and regulate their
translation. It also plays a role in polyadenylation and alternative
spicing for selected pre-mRNA transcripts (42). In these capacities,
HuR is an essential protein, as evidenced by the inability of HuR
knockout mice to survive (43) and the lethal consequences of
globally induced HuR silencing in adult mice (44). Making use of
the versatility of the 3DNA nanocarrier, we conjugated the 3DNA
to FA aiming to suppress HuR in tumor cells while avoiding
toxicity in healthy cells. Folate receptor-a (FR) expression is
frequently ampliﬁed on tumor cells, including ovarian tumor
cells, allowing for preferential tumor uptake via receptor-mediated endocytosis (45). Our biodistribution study demonstrated
efﬁcient tumor targeting, as minimal ﬂuorescence was observed
in normal tissues following systemically administered Cy3labeled FA-3DNA. In addition, mice showed no outward signs
of distress and we did not observe any formulation-dependent
toxicity in noncancerous tissues after multiple administrations
of FA-3DNA-siHuR over a period of several weeks. However,
while 3DNA-siHuR formulations demonstrated signiﬁcant
tumor growth inhibition compared with controls in efﬁcacy
studies, the difference of tumor growth suppression and lifespan extension between mice treated with FA-targeted and
those treated with nontargeted siHuR formulations was not
signiﬁcant. It is noteworthy, however, that FA conjugation
always yielded better outcomes than nontargeted formulations,
suggesting that FA improved tumor-targeted delivery over and
above that which would be achieved simply by the enhanced
permeability and retention effect. Intratumoral heterogeneity
of FR expression may be a contributing factor that attenuates
FA-targeting effectiveness. It is important to keep in mind that
not all ovarian tumors in patients are FRþ. Screening tumors
for FR expression can be used to identify those patients that
would beneﬁt from FA-targeted therapy (46).
Treatment of ovarian tumor-bearing mice with siHuR significantly reduced the growth rate of tumors, but complete remission of tumors was not attained. While targeting HuR is an
attractive therapeutic strategy because it leads to disruption of
multiple genes in core signaling pathways, the overall effectiveness of a monotherapy based on HuR suppression depends
on the amount of HuR present in tumor cells. Disparity in HuR
expression and localization is likely to be heavily inﬂuenced by
the tumor microenvironment, which can show signiﬁcant interand intratumoral heterogeneity in terms of blood ﬂow, oxygenation, and nutrient supply (47). We have shown that HuR is
engaged under conditions of hypoglycemia and hypoxia (33).
As such, HuR expression and cytoplasmic localization are
expected to be high in regions within ovarian tumors with the
least amount of vascularization (i.e., greatest hypoxia and
hypoglycemia). Silencing HuR would have little effect on
cancer cells that have low cytoplasmic HuR expression. In
addition, serous ovarian tumors have a very high rate of genetic
instability that leads to extensive heterogeneity within tumors
(48). Mutation of non-HuR–regulated genes may promote

www.aacrjournals.org

tumor progression. It is also possible that the siHuR payload
was not delivered to all tumor cells.
We are currently taking a realistic approach and investigating
combination therapies in which tumor-targeted siHuR is combined with either another siRNA or with chemotherapeutic
drugs. In particular, we are combining siHuR with a siRNA
that silences CLDN3, a non-HuR–regulated gene, thus targeting
a pathway outside the HuR binding'ome. We have previously
shown that siRNA inhibition of the tight junction protein
claudin 3 suppresses ovarian tumor growth in mice (22). We
are also combining siHuR with carboplatin and paclitaxel, the
standard-of-care drugs for ﬁrst-line treatment for ovarian cancer. We have recently shown that silencing HuR sensitizes cells
grown in culture against DNA damaging agents, including
carboplatin and paclitaxel, due, in part, to HuR's acute upregulation of the mitotic inhibitor kinase Wee1 (36). Thus, in
addition to enhancing efﬁcacy directly as a combination therapy, HuR inhibition may also combat drug resistance. The
versatility of the 3DNA nanocarrier may make it possible to
target delivery of combination therapies to tumors using a
single 3DNA formulation.
A similar siRNA/chemotherapy combination therapy in
which a siRNA targeting the transmembrane protein EphA2
was combined with paclitaxel showed promising results in
preclinical tests in ovarian tumor-bearing mice and has recently
been approved by the FDA for use in a phase I clinical trial
(18, 49). As in our study using siHuR as a monotherapy, despite
signiﬁcant reduction in tumor growth, complete tumor remission was not obtained with the siEphA2/paclitaxel combination therapy. Interestingly, EphA2 is among the many genes
that are posttranscriptionally regulated by HuR (50). Given the
numerous genes and miRNAs that have signiﬁcantly altered
expression in ovarian tumors and are either presumed or have
been shown to be regulated by HuR, some of which are known
to sensitize cells to chemotherapeutics (e.g., miR-200c, class III
b-tubulin; see ref. 41), tumor-targeted HuR inhibition in combination with clinically relevant chemotherapeutics may yield
better therapeutic outcomes than those we have observed with
siHuR monotherapy.
