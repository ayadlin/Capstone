Abstract
Approximately 20% of early-stage breast cancers display
ampliﬁcation or overexpression of the ErbB2/HER2 oncogene,
conferring poor prognosis and resistance to endocrine therapy.
Targeting HER2þ tumors with trastuzumab or the receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor lapatinib signiﬁcantly improves
survival, yet tumor resistance and progression of metastatic
disease still develop over time. Although the mechanisms of
cytosolic HER2 signaling are well studied, nuclear signaling
components and gene regulatory networks that bestow
therapeutic resistance and limitless proliferative potential are
incompletely understood. Here, we use biochemical and bioinformatic approaches to identify effectors and targets of HER2
transcriptional signaling in human breast cancer. Phosphorylation and activity of the Steroid Receptor Coactivator-3 (SRC3) is reduced upon HER2 inhibition, and recruitment of SRC-3
to regulatory elements of endogenous genes is impaired. Tran-

scripts regulated by HER2 signaling are highly enriched with
E2F1 binding sites and deﬁne a gene signature associated with
proliferative breast tumor subtypes, cell-cycle progression, and
DNA replication. We show that HER2 signaling promotes
breast cancer cell proliferation through regulation of E2F1driven DNA metabolism and replication genes together with
phosphorylation and activity of the transcriptional coactivator
SRC-3. Furthermore, our analyses identiﬁed a cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) signaling node that, when targeted using the
CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, deﬁnes overlap and divergence
of adjuvant pharmacologic targeting. Importantly, lapatinib
and palbociclib strictly block de novo synthesis of DNA, mostly
through disruption of E2F1 and its target genes. These results
have implications for rational discovery of pharmacologic
combinations in preclinical models of adjuvant treatment and
therapeutic resistance. Cancer Res; 76(6); 1463–75. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

domain proteins that function, in part, as signal adaptors
and ampliﬁers for downstream kinase activity. Ras/Raf/MAPK
and PI3K/AKT pathways are subsequently activated and the
cascading substrates of these phospho-signaling events become
effectors of cell division, evasion of apoptosis, and general tumorigenicity (1, 2).
Steroid Receptor Coactivator-3 (SRC-3/AIB1/NCOA3) is a
potent transcriptional coregulator for various nuclear receptors
and transcription factors, including E2F1, NFkB, and members of
the ETS family (3–6). SRC-3 is ampliﬁed and/or overexpressed in
a wide variety of tumors, including ampliﬁcation in up to 10%
and overexpression in up to 60% of breast tumors (3, 7–10).
Importantly, SRC-3 is a coactivating partner for estrogen receptor
(ERa), the cognate effector for the mitogenic action of estrogenic
steroids in the mammary epithelium (11). ERa expression is an
important biomarker for prognosis and treatment and is present
in 70% of breast tumors at diagnosis, most of which receive
endocrine therapy to block estrogen synthesis or receptor activity
(12, 13). The function of SRC-3 in breast cancer has been intensively studied because it is a major coactivator for ERa and a
prominent, overexpressed oncogene. The coactivation potential
of SRC-3 is tightly regulated by posttranslational modiﬁcations
that alter protein activity, stability, and subcellular localization
(14, 15). In the context of ERa and NFkB-regulated transcription,
SRC-3 is differentially activated via phosphorylation at multiple
residues in response to estradiol or TNFa (14, 16). Collectively,
these studies position SRC-3 as a potential "signal integrator" of

The ErbB/HER receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family of membrane growth factor receptors activates multiple signaling pathways and is often associated with cancer. Tyrosine kinase activity
in this family of receptors is accomplished through homo- or
heterodimerization of ErbB family members (EGFR/ERBB1,
HER2/ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4) upon ligand binding and/or
membrane juxtaposition, and subsequent auto-and cross-phosphorylation of intracellular domains (1). Phosphorylated receptor tyrosine residues serve as docking platforms for various SH2

various cytokine and hormone elicited cell-signaling events that
specify distinct patterns of gene expression (17).
Clinical studies have shown that breast cancer patients with
tumors expressing high levels of both HER2 and SRC-3 display
resistance to endocrine therapy and have reduced disease-free
survival (12, 18, 19). Furthermore, SRC-3 knockout mice are
resistant to HER2/neu-mediated breast tumorigenesis and display signiﬁcantly reduced phosphorylation of key signaling
components, including HER2, AKT, and JNK (20). In MCF-7
breast cancer cells, SRC-3 phosphorylation is inﬂuenced by
HER2 (21). Together, these studies suggest HER2 and SRC-3
are cooperating oncogenes whereby HER2 signaling events
inﬂuence SRC-3 activity on discrete gene programs. However,
the transcriptional targets of HER2 and SRC-3 are largely
undescribed and it is unknown whether intrinsic SRC-3 activity
and speciﬁc phosphorylation sites are affected by HER2. Ampliﬁcation of HER2 occurs in approximately 20% of all breast
tumors, and overexpression of HER2 and SRC-3 is associated
with endocrine resistance and extremely poor prognosis. Given
the link between HER2 signaling and SRC-3 in breast cancer
and the importance of SRC-3 phosphorylation for its coactivation of steroid receptors and other transcription factors, the
combined effects of HER2 and SRC-3 on gene regulation are
understudied in breast cancer. Additionally, nuclear effectors of
HER2 signaling that regulate transcription of tumorigenic gene
networks are incompletely understood.
Here, we study the effects of HER2-mediated signaling events
on SRC-3 activity in breast cancer cells with ampliﬁed HER2
and SRC-3 genes. HER2 depletion attenuates site-speciﬁc phosphorylation of SRC-3, leading to a reduction in its intrinsic
activity. Transcriptomic analysis identiﬁes genes that are regulated by HER2 signaling, with a massive enrichment for transcripts involved in mitotic cell-cycle processes and DNA replication. A striking majority of genes downregulated upon HER2
depletion contain canonical and evidence-based binding sites
for the E2F1 transcription factor. Moreover, bioinformatics
reveals a common HER2/SRC-3/E2F1 target gene (CCND1)
that is signiﬁcantly correlated with sensitivity to RKT inhibitors
and identiﬁes a CDK signaling node amendable to pharmacologic targeting. Our results suggest that SRC-3 and E2F1 serve a
membrane-to-nuclear conduit function for HER2 signaling,
resulting in an anabolic DNA gene signature exploitable by
combinatorial therapies.

Sample preparation, immunoblotting, and RT-PCR
For protein analysis, cells were lysed (20 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH
8.0, 150 mmol/L NaCL, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.5% NP-40) for 1
hour at 4 C, followed by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 10
minutes. The supernatant was removed to a fresh tube and diluted
for quantitation using the Bradford method. Samples were separated using NuPAGE 4% to 12% Bis–Tris gels (Life Technologies)
and transferred to nitrocellulose using methanol transfer buffer.
Membranes were blocked in 5% fat-free milk reconstituted in PBS
plus 0.5% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Primary antibodies were diluted in 1% fat-free milk in PBST
and blots incubated for several hours at room temperature or
overnight at 4 C. Species-speciﬁc secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used with traditional
enhanced chemiluminescense and X-ray ﬁlm. Densitometric
quantiﬁcation was performed using ImageJ and numbers in
ﬁgures represent the area under curve for each band, normalized to actin in the identical lane. TRIzol reagent (low pH
phenol; Life Technologies) was used to collect and extract total
RNA. RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop
spectrometer and integrity was evaluated using Lab-on-chip
(Agilent). Reverse transcription using random hexamer priming
(BioRad iScript) was performed before qPCR on ABI OneStep
with Roche Universal Library hydrolysis probes. Data were
analyzed using the DDCT method (see www.nursa.org/qpcr_tutorials/ for review). Detailed descriptions of primer sequences
are listed in Supplementary Table S2.

Materials and Methods

Microarray analysis, motif scanning, and bioinformatics
RNA was prepared from BT-474 cells as described above and
hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A
2.0 Array chips by the Genomic and RNA Proﬁling (GARP) core
facility at the Baylor College of Medicine, and analysis was
performed using BRB Array Tools (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/
BRB-ArrayTools.html), dChip (http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/

probesets that were at least 2-fold downregulated upon HER2
depletion. Bioinformatics were performed using a collection of
resources in the Dan L. Duncan Cancer Center and Department
of Molecular and Cellular Biology. Brieﬂy, the Galaxy/Cistrome
suite, NCBI Gene ID, and existing data deposits were used in
combination with SQL-based database organization to queue

Cell culture, growth assays, and reagents
BT-474 and SKBR-3 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco/Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 2 mg/L insulin. Cells were obtained from ATCC,
and cell identity was veriﬁed using short tandem repeat (STR)
analysis routinely by the Tissue Culture Core at Baylor College
of Medicine, Houston, TX. For growth assays, 5  104 cells were
plated per well on 12- or 24-well multiwell plates in complete
media and allowed to settle, and the following day were rinsed
once with phenol red-free DMEM before treatment in identical
conditions supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS.
For Figs. 1A, C, E and 6A and B, crystal violet staining with
colorimetric absorbance was used to measure cell density.
For Fig. 6C and D, MTS (Promega) assay was used. Detailed
descriptions of reagents are listed in Supplementary Table S2.

RNAi, transfections, and luciferase assays
siRNA was custom designed and/or ordered as prevalidated
duplexes (Life Technologies; see Supplementary Table S2 for
details). BT-474 cells were plated on 6-well plates at a density of
4  105 per well 1 day prior to transfection in reduced serum
media (OPTI-MEM; Life Technologies) at a ﬁnal concentration of
40 nmol/L siRNA. Luciferase reporter and plasmid DNA transfections with siRNA are performed similarly with Lipofectamine
2000 (Life Technologies). Cells were harvested in Tris–EDTA–
NaCl (TEN) buffer, pelleted at 3500  g, and suspended in
reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Reporter activity was measured
using a Thermo Luminoskan Ascent. Relative light unit (RLU)
was calculated relative to total protein quantity. Detailed descriptions of reagents and catalog numbers are listed in Supplementary

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
ChIP was performed as described with minor modiﬁcations
(25). Brieﬂy, cells were ﬁxed in 1% formaldehyde before quenching with 125 mmol/L glycine. Cells were washed twice with icecold TEN buffer and scraped into tubes on ice. Cell pellets were
either ﬂash frozen and stored at 80 C or resuspended in 500 mL
of Tris–EDTA (TE)/1% SDS. All steps beyond this point were done
on ice or at 4 C. This suspension was sonicated for 8 cycles of
10 pulses at amplitude 90 and duty cycle 3.5 on a Branson
Soniﬁer 250. Chromatin extracts were cleared by centrifugation
and diluted 1:10 in a buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris–HCl
(pH8.0), 150 NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, and 1% Triton-X-100 to
reduce SDS concentration. Four micrograms of normal rabbit
IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used with 50 mL
Protein A/G Agarose plus salmon sperm DNA (Millipore)
to preclear the diluted chromatin for 1 hour. The cleared

supernatant was incubated with 4-mg SRC-3 antibody (Cell
Signaling 5E11) or control IgG overnight. Agarose beads were
used to precipitate immune complexes for 1 hour before
washing in buffers of increasing stringency as follows: 1X in
20 mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100; 1 in 20 mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH

1 in 10 mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1%
deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, and 0.25 M LiCl; and 2 with TE.
Beads were centrifuged at 1,000 g for 1 minute to pellet. DNA
was eluted from beads in 100 mmol/L NaHCO3 and 1% SDS at
65 C overnight. Extraction was performed using PCR product
puriﬁcation columns (Qiagen).
Tritium(3H)-labeled thymidine incorporation
Cells were plated on 6-well plates at a density of 2  105 per well
and treated with lapatinib, palbociclib, or bufalin for 24 hours in
normal growth media. Four mC of 3H-labeled thymidine (Perkin
Elmer) was added to the media, and cells were grown for two
additional hours. Media were removed, and cells were ﬁxed for 5
minutes with 25% acetic acid in methanol, rinsed once with
methanol, and protein precipitated using 5% trichloric acid for
5 minutes. Wells were washed an additional 3 times with methanol and allowed to dry. Radioactivity was recovered using 1N

Results
BT-474 cells display HER2-dependent estrogen responsiveness
and resistance to antiestrogens
Resistance to selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) in
HER2þ breast cancer is incompletely understood. Speciﬁcally,
whether HER2 expression is required for sensitivity to estrogen
and SERMs in HER2-ampliﬁed cells remains unanswered. The BT474 breast cancer cell line represents the ideal model system to
study effects of endogenously ampliﬁed HER2 and SRC-3 oncogenes on estrogen signaling because it is also positive for ERa
expression (data not shown; ref. 3). We ﬁrst tested the mitogenic
activity of 17b-estradiol (E2) and effects of the SERMs 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) and raloxifene (Ral) on cell growth and
gene expression. Cell density was signiﬁcantly increased by E2
relative to vehicle treatment, while tamoxifen and raloxifene
failed to decrease cell density relative to the vehicle control,
indicating resistance (Fig. 1A). Likewise, transcript levels of
canonical ERa-target genes were signiﬁcantly induced upon E2
treatment, but not affected by treatment with either SERM
(Fig. 1B). Upon HER2 knockdown, E2 is no longer mitogenic in
BT-474 cells (Fig. 1C, E2 panel). Moreover, siRNA against HER2
signiﬁcantly sensitized cells to treatment with 4HT or Ral (Fig. 1C,
4HT and Ral panels; note the decrease in cell density over time in
siHER2 transfected cells). These results conﬁrm that BT-474 cell
growth requires HER2 expression for estrogen sensitivity and
SERM resistance and indicate that HER2 protects cells from
SERM-induced apoptosis. Indeed, when HER2 is depleted using
siRNA, caspase-3 is cleaved (activated) upon treatment with 4HT
or Ral, but not vehicle or estrogen (Fig. 1D, compare T and R to V
or E in siHER2 lanes). The action of SERMs is postulated to occur,
at least in part, through disruption of the interaction between ERa
and its transcriptional coactivators, such as SRC-3 (26). Depletion
of SRC-3 also induced caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1D) and
decreased survival of breast cancer cells grown in steroid replete
media (Fig. 1E), demonstrating a functional dependency on both
HER2 and SRC-3 survival pathways in this cell model.
HER2 signaling affects SRC-3 phosphorylation and activity
Steroid Receptor Coactivator-3 is a potent coactivator for
numerous transcription factors involved in breast cancer and the
preference of SRC-3 for, and activity with, different transcription
factors is inﬂuenced by combinatorial phosphorylation (14). To
determine if HER2 signaling affects SRC-3 phosphorylation and
function, siRNA was used to deplete HER2 in BT-474 cells.
Knockdown of HER2 results in decreased SRC-3 phosphorylation
at T24, S543, S857, and S860 (Fig. 2A–C). Importantly, this loss of
phosphorylation does not appear to be uniform for SRC-3 protein
because S505 phosphorylation remains unchanged upon HER2
depletion (Fig. 2A). These data are consistent with a lack of change
in total SRC-3 protein levels upon HER2 knockdown, as S505 has
been described to function as part of a phospho-degron (27).
Because SRC-3 does not directly bind DNA, a system using a
GAL4-DNA binding domain fused to the N-terminus of SRC-3

1466 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

(pBIND-SRC-3) and a pGL5-Luciferase reporter was used to
interrogate whether HER2 inﬂuences intrinsic SRC-3 activity.
Upon HER2 knockdown, intrinsic SRC-3 activity is signiﬁcantly
reduced (Fig. 2D). These results can be pharmacologically recapitulated using an inhibitor of HER2, AG-825 (tyrphostin;
Fig. 2E). Additionally, transient transfection of HER2 is sufﬁcient
to enhance SRC-3 transcriptional activity (Fig. 2F, compare 200 vs.
300 ng of pBind-SRC-3). These data corroborate previous studies
suggesting a role for SRC-3 in HER2 tumorigenesis and highlight
the ability of this oncogenic signaling pathway to elicit strong
effects on transcriptional processes. Taken together, our results
show that HER2 signaling has speciﬁc effects on SRC-3 phosphorylation and is capable of increasing the intrinsic activity of
SRC-3.
HER2 depletion drastically alters the transcriptional landscape
The transcriptional consequences of HER2 action undoubtedly
play a signiﬁcant role in its oncogenic activity, but relatively
few studies have comprehensively investigated the transcriptional
targets of HER2 signaling. To deﬁne the HER2-regulated transcriptome, we performed microarray analysis on cells transfected
with control or HER2 siRNA (Fig. 3A). HER2 knockdown
decreased AKT and Raf phosphorylation, indicating disruption
of the downstream HER2 signaling cascade (Fig. 3B). Substantial
transcriptional changes upon HER2 depletion are evident in the
heat map shown in Fig. 3C. Gene Ontology analysis of transcripts
downregulated upon HER2 depletion indicated an impressive
decrease of transcripts involved in cell cycle and mitotic processes
(Fig. 3D), and RT-PCR conﬁrmed loss of transcripts involved in Sphase DNA replication, Ras signaling, and transcription factor
genes (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover, parsing this HER2regulated transcriptome with gene signatures associated with Ras/
Raf/MAPK or PI3K/AKT signaling revealed signiﬁcant overlap and
divergence between these signaling pathways (Supplementary
Fig. S1B–S1D). Conﬁrming a role for cell-cycle disruption when
HER2 is depleted, a reduction in G1 to S phase transition is
observed using ﬂow cytometry to analyze DNA content (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Next, we compared genes that were downregulated upon HER2
knockdown with publicly available breast cancer gene expression
patterns in TCGA in relation to HER2 and SRC-3 (NCOA3)
expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S3). Strikingly, tumor
samples with the highest expression of HER2 (Supplementary
Fig. S3, top) or SRC-3 (Supplementary Fig. S3, bottom) also
displayed high expression of HER2-sensitive genes identiﬁed by
microarray upon HER2 depletion. Jointly considered, these data
indicate that loss of HER2 in breast cancer cells results in a
substantial decrease of transcripts involved in cellular proliferation that relates to expression of HER2 and SRC-3 in a large dataset
of breast tumor samples.
Because HER2 is present at extracellular membranes and thus
acts as an indirect effector of nuclear transcription, we next
investigated transcription factor–binding motifs in the proximal
promoter regions of downregulated genes. Interrogation of 1-kb
upstream promoter sequences of putative target genes identiﬁed
an E2F1 consensus sequence as the most signiﬁcantly enriched
transcription factor motif (Fig. 3E). Transcript levels for E2F1 and
its target genes CCND1 and CDC25A have similar expression
patterns in our microarray analysis (Fig. 3F) and HER2 knockdown depletes the protein levels of these gene products (Fig. 3G–
I). Upon HER2 knockdown, E2F1 protein levels were abolished

(Fig. 3G), which also was observed upon SRC-3 knockdown,
indicating that HER2 and SRC-3 signaling likely converge on E2F1
target genes (Fig. 3H). Quantitative RT-PCR screening of HER2
target genes revealed that transcripts for additional mitogenic
transcription factors FOXM1 and ETV4, as well as the G1 to S
checkpoint gene CCND1, are signiﬁcantly decreased in cells
transfected with siRNA against SRC-3 or HER2 (Supplementary
Fig. S4C). These results suggest that depletion of HER2 or SRC-3
reduces the expression of multiple transcription factors, including
E2F1, which are known to regulate the transcription of genes
involved in mitotic progression and proliferation (28–30).
A majority of genes regulated by HER2 contain E2F1 binding
sites
All E2F family gene transcripts except E2F4 and E2F6 were
decreased upon HER2 knockdown in the microarray, and E2F7
and E2F8 were among the most depleted transcripts in the entire
array (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Given the large
number of cell-cycle and mitotic genes downregulated upon
HER2 depletion and the enrichment for E2F1 motifs, we investigated E2F1 transcription factor binding to DNA regulatory
elements of HER2-regulated genes. Binding sites for E2F1 from

www.aacrjournals.org

published chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIPseq) in breast cancer cells (31) were compared with transcripts
from our BT-474 siHER2 microarray. Brieﬂy, chromosomal coordinates of signiﬁcantly downregulated genes were compared with
E2F1 binding site intervals within the extended promoter region
(EPR, 7.5 to þ2.5 Kb) or anywhere within the gene and including 10-kb gene-ﬂanking regions (10 kb). A striking majority of
genes regulated by HER2 (>75%) in our microarray are bound by
E2F1 (Fig. 4A). Atypical E2F7 and E2F8 ChIP-seq binding in
cancer cells also shows signiﬁcant overlap with the HER2 gene
signature, and E2F8 may be a HER2 and SRC-3 target gene
(Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5C). Transcript and protein levels of
E2F7 and E2F8 were reduced with siRNA transfection of siHER2 or
siSRC-3 (Supplementary Fig. S5D–S5F). These results are intriguing considering a proposed role of atypical E2Fs in maintenance of
genome size and cancer, but E2F7 and E2F8 function was not
further explored in this study (32, 33). Additionally, HER2regulated genes with E2F1 promoter binding sites displayed
overlap with PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/MAPK gene signatures
(Supplementary Fig. S6A).
The CCND1 gene is ﬂanked by E2F1 binding sites including a
known SRC-3 binding element downstream, colloquially termed

by E2F1 and SRC-3 in BT-474 cells (Fig. 4C), and upon HER2
knockdown, SRC-3 recruitment to CCND1 enh2 is signiﬁcantly
reduced (Fig. 4D). Moreover, treatment with the HER2 inhibitor
lapatinib results in decreased SRC-3 recruitment, and H3K27
acetylation (but not H3K14ac) is lost from the enhancer region
(Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data show that HER2-mediated
gene regulation involves mechanisms of E2F1 and SRC-3 recruitment to gene regulatory elements involved in mitogenic expression of CCND1.
The HER2 transcriptome signature correlates with E2F1 and
proliferative breast cancer subtypes
BT-474 cells have previously been characterized as a Luminal B
subtype model for breast cancer owing to HER2 ampliﬁcation and
ERa expression (35), and we observe responsiveness to estrogen
but HER2-dependent resistance to antiestrogens (see Fig. 1A). As

suggested from cistromic and transcriptomic analyses, comparing
our HER2 gene signature expression scores with two large breast
tumor datasets reveals a strong correlation with E2F1 expression
(Table insets, Fig. 5A and B). Additionally, the HER2-regulated
gene signature correlates with the most proliferative breast cancer
subtypes: basal, HER2þ, and luminal B (Fig. 5A and B, histograms). Tumors considered to be slow growing (luminal A and
normal-like) display a negative correlation with our HER2 gene
signature, as do the predictors of luminal A subtype, ERa and PR
(Fig. 5). Collectively, gene signatures from patient samples are
consistent with our in vitro ﬁndings and indicate that HER2
signaling mediates a proliferative regulatory gene network in
breast cancer.

cancer types, including resistance to geﬁtinib (Supplementary Fig.
S6B). Importantly, CCND1 is involved in breast cancer sensitivity
to the HER/EGFR family inhibitors geﬁtinib, lapatinib, and afatinib (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer; ref. 37). Taken in
context, these results suggest that HER2/E2F1 signaling regulates
cyclin D1 and other genes that may predict sensitivity to therapy in
proliferative breast cancer subtypes.

function with CCND1 is well described and recent clinical trials
have reported optimistic results and recent FDA approval of the
CDK4/6-speciﬁc inhibitor palbociclib (PD 0332991, Pﬁzer;
ref. 40), we questioned whether this drug could similarly alter
cell-cycle gene transcription and sensitize breast cancer cells to
other pharmacologic agents. As shown in Fig. 6A, palbociclib
prevented the mitogenic effects of estradiol similar to knockdown
of HER2 (see Fig. 1C). Additionally, combination treatment of
palbociclib with 4HT signiﬁcantly reduced cell survival (Fig. 6A).
Integrators of cellular signaling, such as transcriptional coactivators, may represent an additional "weak link" (and therefore a
therapeutic target) in cancer gene regulation networks owing to
their pleiotropic effects on multiple proliferative pathways. When
palbociclib treatment is used in combination with bufalin, a
recently described inhibitor of SRC-3 (41), we observe a significant combinatorial effect on the decrease in cell survival (Fig. 6B).
Similarly, cellular sensitivity to lapatinib is augmented by palbociclib or bufalin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C and D).
Notably, bufalin is active in the nanomolar range and sensitizes
cells to lower concentrations of lapatinib (Fig. 6D). Similar results
are observed in the HER2þ/ERa breast cancer cell line SKBR-3,
suggesting that these pathways signal cooperatively in other cell
models (Supplementary Fig. S8). Palbociclib treatment reduced
transcript levels of cell-cycle genes E2F1, CDC6, and CDC45, but
not CCND1 (Fig. 6E). Transcript levels of E2F1, CDC6, and
CCND1, but not CDC45, are depleted upon lapatinib treatment,
suggesting that the HER2 pathway converges on similar transcriptional targets as CDK signaling (Fig. 6F). Additional genes
involved in cell-cycle regulation were decreased upon palbociclib
(i.e., E2F7, E2F8, and MCM10) or lapatinib (i.e., E2F7, E2F8, and
ETV4) treatment, indicating that these compounds inﬂuence
broad cell-cycle transcriptional networks (Supplementary Fig.
S9A and S9B). Treatment with lapatinib also decreases protein
levels of CCND1, CDC6, CDC45, MCM10, and ribonucleotide
reductase (RRM2), a rate-limiting enzyme in DNA nucleoside
metabolism (Supplementary Fig. S9C).

Cyclin D1/CDK cross-talk with HER2 converges on
transcriptional regulation of cell-cycle genes
Proliferation is critical in the etiology and associated pathogenicity of cancer. Individual oncogenes and tumor suppressors do
not easily deﬁne the batteries of genes that regulate proliferation
per se, because cell mitosis, DNA replication, and escape from
differentiation pathways involve large gene networks working in
concert. Importantly, because the tumor has become dependent
on cellular events resulting from ampliﬁcation or mutation of
such genes to maintain a proliferative advantage, these genes
represent fragility in the network of cancer cell signaling (2, 38).
Indeed, this has become the basis for directed therapies targeting
oncogenic signaling from tyrosine kinases HER2 and EGFR (2).
We used network analysis of CCND1 and another HER2/E2F1regulated gene from the microarray, CDC6, to identify a fragile
component of this signaling network amendable to pharmacologic
targeting. Network analysis of CCND1 and CDC6 revealed strong
overlap with the HER2 transcriptome. Remarkably, 50% of genes in
the CCND1-associated network, and 59% of CDC6 network genes
are regulated by HER2 in our microarray (Supplementary Table
S1). Not surprisingly, members of the cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDK) family and their regulators are enriched in the CCND1 and
CDC6 networks (Supplementary Fig. S7; ref. 39), which is consistent with KEGG pathway analysis. Because CDK4 and CDK6

Acute lapatinib or palbociclib treatment restricts DNA synthesis
in HER2þ breast cancer cells
Given the broad effect of HER2 and CDK signaling pathways on
transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell-cycle and DNA
replication (Fig. 6G), we reasoned that pharmacologically blocking HER2 or CDK should also block replicative synthesis of DNA
in HER2þ breast cancer cells. Indeed, lapatinib potently restricts
DNA synthesis at low nanomolar concentrations after 24 hours of
treatment, before any major changes occur to cellular health
(Supplementary Fig. S9D–S9G) but concomitant with decreased
phosphorylation of HER2 and cell-cycle protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S9H). Tritiated (3H)-thymidine incorporation to
directly measure DNA synthesis revealed that acute (24-hour)
treatment with lapatinib or palbociclib blocks de novo DNA
replication, without affecting cellular size, shape, or viability (Fig.
6H). Bufalin treatment blocks DNA synthesis to a lesser extent
(Fig. 6H), suggesting the combined effect of bufalin with lapatinib
or palbociclib on cellular viability (see Fig. 6B and D) is consistent
with its mechanistic role of inducing apoptosis (41). Consistent
with the effect of lapatinib and palbociclib on transcription,
protein levels of E2F1, CDC6, and CCND1 are reduced in BT474 and SKBR-3 breast cancer cells after acute treatment (Fig. 6I).
Moreover, the lapatinib-induced reduction of replication fork
proteins and block of DNA replication can be rescued by ectopic

expression of E2F1 (Fig. 6J). Collectively, these results demonstrate that HER2 and CCND1/CDK signaling pathways regulate
DNA replication through E2F1 and its associated transcriptional
targets, many of which are directly involved in nucleotide biosynthesis and replicative processivity. Moreover, our ﬁndings
demonstrate the potential for combined targeting of HER2 and
CDK signaling pathways or DNA replication may be a rational
model that warrants further investigation in preclinical studies.

Discussion
We describe an E2F1 transcriptional network downstream of
HER2 signaling that is inﬂuenced by SRC-3 phosphorylation in
breast cancer cells. Overexpression of SRC-3 contributes to the
etiology and progression of breast cancer, and mice lacking SRC-3
are resistant to oncogene and carcinogen-induced breast tumorigenesis (20, 42, 43). Moreover, SRC-3 is a coactivator for E2F1

transcription, resulting in breast cancer cell proliferation and
antiestrogen resistance (5). However, the involvement of E2F1
in HER2-driven transcriptional programs in breast cancer is relatively understudied. Recently, several studies have reported E2F
activators (typically considered to be E2F1-3) in the context of
HER2/neu, c-Myc, or Ras oncogene–induced breast tumors in
mouse models (44, 45). Andrechek and Wu and colleagues found
that E2f1 and E2f3 (and to a lesser extent E2f2) knockout mice are
protected from HER2/neu tumorigenesis, and E2F1-3 transcripts
are coordinately elevated in human tumors with high HER2
expression (44, 45). Moreover, E2F1 is known to be involved in
a feed-forward autoregulatory loop with SRC-3 (46, 47). These
reports are in agreement with our ﬁndings and highlight the
intricacies of a proliferative and antiapoptotic E2F1 transcriptional network downstream of oncogenic HER2 activity in breast
cancer cells that has been underappreciated. More research is
needed to understand autoregulatory mechanisms and cross-talk
between all members of the E2F family. Moreover, it will be

1472 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

critical to investigate how oncogenes such as SRC-3 and HER2
hijack E2F-mediated gene regulation to achieve wanton DNA
replication and cellular proliferation.
Cross-talk and overlap involving HER2 and estrogen signaling
have been extensively studied with implications for resistance to
endocrine and adjuvant therapies in breast cancer (48). Mechanisms proposed include phosphorylation-mediated export of ERa
from the nuclear compartment, reduction of ERa expression, and
high expression of SRC-3 (13). Importantly, the genomic loci for
HER2 and SRC-3 in the BT-474 cells used in this study are
ampliﬁed, while maintaining ERa expression and estrogen sensitivity despite SERM resistance (Fig. 1; ref. 3). This resistance is
dependent on HER2 expression, and cells undergo caspase-mediated apoptosis upon HER2 depletion and treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene. Interestingly, BT-474 cells devoid of HER2 fail
to respond to the proliferative estrogen signal, indicating substantial coordination between these two pathways in breast cancer
cells. Considering that 70% of breast tumors are ERþ, future

cell proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, and resistance to antiestrogens or therapeutic drugs is unlikely. In contrast, coregulators
and associated transcription factors serve as nodal integrators of
cellular signaling pathways and drive transcription of gene networks required for oncogenesis and tumorigenicity. It is likely that
diverse oncogenic signaling pathways use discrete coactivators as
critical signaling integrators, perhaps in a tissue-speciﬁc manner.
Importantly, these coactivators may represent a unique class of
targets to sensitize tumors to existing therapies.
Therapy options for breast and other cancers are ever evolving
and preclinical investigations in tractable models will be informative for hypothesis-driven clinical trials. The data presented in
the current study unveils previously unappreciated interplay
between known oncogenic and proliferative genes and an anabolic DNA replication pathway used to drive cell growth. Importantly, we show that combinations of treatments (siRNA, SERMs,
and small-molecule inhibitors) can increase sensitivity to inhibitors of alternate pathways of gene regulation that normally lead to
treatment-resistant growth and cell survival. Moreover, we identify anabolic metabolism of DNA as an important downstream
effect of the HER2 oncogene. Future studies should be directed at
deﬁning transcriptional and cistromic mechanisms involved in
therapy resistance and beneﬁt (or lack thereof) in targeting multiple pathways.
