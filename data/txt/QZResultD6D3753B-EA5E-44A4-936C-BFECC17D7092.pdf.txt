Abstract
Tumor stroma drives the growth and progression of cancers. A heparin-binding epidermal growth factor–like
growth factor, HB-EGF, is an EGF receptor ligand that stimulates cell growth in an autocrine or paracrine
fashion. While elevated expression of HB-EGF in cancer cells and its contribution to tumor progression are well
documented, the effects of HB-EGF expression in the tumor stroma have not been clarified. Here, we show that
HB-EGF is expressed in stromal fibroblasts where it promotes cancer cell proliferation. In uterine cervical
cancers, HB-EGF was detected immunohistochemically in the stroma proximal to the cancer epithelium.
Proliferation of cervical cancer cells in vitro was enhanced by coculture with fibroblasts isolated from tumor
tissues of patients with cervical cancer. Inhibition of HB-EGF function or treatment with platelet–derived
growth factor (PDGF) inhibitors abrogated cancer cell growth enhanced by cervical cancer–associated fibroblast
(CCF) coculture. Furthermore, tumor formation in a mouse xenograft model was enhanced by cotransplantation
of CCF or mouse embryonic fibroblasts, but not with embryonic fibroblasts from HB-EGF–deficient mice.
Conversely, conditioned medium from cancer cells induced HB-EGF expression in CCF. Mechanistic investigations established that PDGF was the primary factor responsible. Together, our findings indicate that HB-EGF
and PDGF reciprocally mediate the interaction of cancer cells with cancer-associated fibroblasts, promoting
cancer cell proliferation in a paracrine manner that has implications for novel combinatorial cancer therapies.

Introduction
Tumor-surrounding tissues or the tumor stroma influence
the behavior of carcinomas (1). The tumor stroma consists of
extracellular matrix (ECM) and various types of cells including
fibroblasts, immune and inflammatory cells, and blood vessel
cells. Invasive carcinoma is often associated with expansion of
the tumor stroma and increased deposition of ECM. Cancer
cells can alter their adjacent stroma to form a permissive and
supportive environment for tumor progression by producing
growth factors, proteases, protease inhibitors, and ECM mole-

cules. Fibroblasts within the tumor stroma, referred to as
"cancer-associated fibroblasts" (CAF), have a modified phenotype and a prominent role in the progression, growth, and
spread of cancers (2–4). Crosstalk between cancer cells and the
stromal fibroblasts is assumed. Cancer cells secrete various
kinds of growth factors that stimulate their own proliferation in
an autocrine manner. Some cancer cell–secreted growth factors, including TGFb, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF),
and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, act as key mediators of
fibroblast activation (2, 3, 5). The activated CAFs have a variety
of effects on both cancer cells and the surrounding stroma.
Their effects include altering the ECM environment, inducing
an inflammatory response, and activating angiogenesis, as well
as stimulating cancer cell proliferation and invasion by growth
factor secretion. Thus, cancer–CAF interaction constitutes
critical routes for cancer development and progression.
Cervical cancer is one of the most life-threatening diseases
for women worldwide (6). Infection with human papilloma
viruses (HPV) may be the first step of its carcinogenesis (7).
Despite infection with HPV, most of the resultant precancerous lesions, termed squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), do
not progress to an invasive carcinoma, suggesting that HPV
does not act alone in the development of cervical cancer.
Cervical cancer has a prominent stromal compartment. In the
course of its progression, carcinoma cells invade the stroma,
interact with fibroblasts, and change the stromal environment

in a manner termed desmoplastic change or stromal reaction.
Accordingly, the gene expression patterns of stromal cells are
largely altered in cervical carcinogenesis (8). A study using a
genetically-engineered mouse model suggested the presence
of crosstalk between cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts,
in which PDGF secreted from cancer cells stimulated PDGF
receptor–expressing CAFs, leading to the induction of FGF-2
and FGF-7 production by CAFs which in turn stimulated
angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation (5).
Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor–like growth factor (HB-EGF) is an EGF receptor (EGFR) ligands, synthesized as
a transmembrane precursor protein (pro-HB-EGF; ref. 9). Its
extracellular domain is then cleaved by proteases, via the socalled ectodomain-shedding mechanism, which yields the
soluble mature growth factor (sHB-EGF; ref. 10). sHB-EGF
shows strong mitogenic and motility activity by acting through
the EGFR (11–13). HB-EGF is involved in malignancy. Upregulation of HB-EGF has been reported in many types of
malignant tumors (14–22). In the case of ovarian cancer,
HB-EGF expression was increased in advanced cancers compared with that in normal ovaries and was associated with
poor clinical outcome (14, 23). Although increasing evidence has accumulated on the role of HB-EGF in tumor cell
growth and tumor progression (24), no study on the role of
HB-EGF expressed in stromal fibroblasts has been reported.
Here, we show that HB-EGF is produced by stromal fibroblasts in uterine cervical cancer. Coculturing the human
cervical cancer cell line ME180 with cervical cancer–associated fibroblasts (CCF) in vivo and in vitro indicated that
stromal HB-EGF contributes to the enhanced proliferation
of ME180 cells. On the other hand, PDGF produced in
ME180 cells induced HB-EGF expression in fibroblasts, suggesting that these growth factors contribute to the reciprocal
interaction of cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and reagents
Details about the antibodies and reagents are described in
the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Pathology scoring
HB-EGF immunostaining was simultaneously evaluated by
3 independent observers (including one gynecologic oncologist and one gynecologic pathologist), and a consensus was
reached for each score. The positive reaction for HB-EGF was
scored into 4 grades according to the following intensities of
staining; 0, 1þ, 2þ, and 3þ. The percentage of the positive
staining area was also scored into the following 4 categories:
1 (0%–25%), 2 (26%–50%), 3 (51%–75%), and 4 (76%–100%).
The sum of the intensity and percentage scores was used as
the final staining score (25). The staining pattern of the frozen
sections was defined as follows: 1, negative; 2–3, weak; 4–5,
moderate; and 6–7, strong.
Cell culture
The cervical cancer cell line HeLa and squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC)-derived ME180 cells were purchased from

6634

Cancer Res; 71(21) November 1, 2011

the American Type Culture Collection. The TCS and CaSki cell
lines were obtained from the RIKEN BioResource Center. All
the cell lines were passaged in our laboratory soon after
receipt from cell banks, divided, and stocked in liquid nitrogen
vessels. Each experiment was carried out using thawed cells
without further authentication. Mouse embryonic fibroblast
(MEF) cells from wild-type mice (MEF-HBþ/þ) or HB-EGF
knockout (KO) mice (MEF-HB/) were obtained as described
(26). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/
mL penicillin G, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. CCF cells were
obtained as described in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS
and antibiotics.
Coculture of ME180 cells and fibroblasts in
3-dimensional collagen gels
Unless otherwise stated, coculture assays were conducted under the following conditions. CCF cells (1 
105) or MEF cells (1  105) were plated into 24-well plates
3 days before coculture experiments and cultured in
0.75 mL of DMEM containing 1% FBS. ME180 cells (2 
102) were inoculated in 0.25 mL of 3-dimensional collagen
gel (13) using a Falcon cell culture insert (0.4-mm pore size
membrane; Becton Dickinson Labware). HB-EGF–neutralizing IgG (10 mg/mL), control goat IgG (10 mg/mL), CRM197
(500 ng/mL), or other inhibitors were added to the collagen
gel. The cell culture inserts containing 3-dimensional–
cultured ME180 cells were set into 24-well dishes at
day 0 and cocultured for 14 days. The medium was changed
on day 7 and a neutralizing antibody or control antibody
was added to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. On day 14,
ME180 cells were recovered by treatment with collagenase
and the viable cell numbers were counted (13). The effects
of inhibitors on the growth of cervical cancer cells in
coculture with CCF cells were expressed as a percentage
of the control calculated by the following formula: total cell
number of cervical cancer cells cocultured with CCF1 cells
in the presence of a particular inhibitor divided by that of
cervical cancer cells cocultured with CCF1 cells in the
absence of a particular inhibitor  100.
Mouse xenografting experiments
ME180 cells alone or mixtures of ME180 cells with either
CCF cells or MEF cells were subcutaneously injected into the
left flank of female athymic nude mouse at the cell numbers
indicated in the figure legends. Unless otherwise stated, the
tumor size was measured in 3 dimensions with calipers, and
the tumor volume (mm3) was calculated using the formula:
V ¼ 0.52  length  width  height.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean  SD. Statistical analysis of
HB-EGF staining in various stages of cervical cancer progression was conducted with the c2 test. The statistical significance of other experimental data was evaluated using one-way
ANOVA. Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.

HB-EGF and Cervical Cancer

Results

staining in the stroma and epithelium were scored (Fig. 1B,
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). No HB-EGF immunostaining was recorded in normal cervical stroma, whereas moderate to strong stromal HB-EGF immunostaining was observed
in 33% of LSIL cases, 66% of HSIL cases, and all cases of SCC. In
contrast, all the tissues had negative to weak immunostaining
in the epithelium. These results indicate that HB-EGF protein
is increased in the stromal tissues during cervical carcinogenesis, suggesting that it is involved in its progression. In
addition, stromal HB-EGF immunostaining was observed in
adenocarcinoma tissue and small cell carcinoma tissue, as
well as in SCC of the uterine cervix (Supplementary Table S1
and Fig. S1).
Strong HB-EGF immunostaining was observed in stromal
fibroblasts localized at the invasion front of cancerous epithelium [Fig. 1A (x and xii)]. The antibody used recognizes
both pro-HB-EGF and sHB-EGF. HB-EGF has strong affinities
for heparin-like molecules and heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

HB-EGF expression in the stroma of uterine cervical
cancers and its correlation with cancer progression
Frozen sections of clinical samples were immunostained
with an anti-human HB-EGF monoclonal antibody. In normal
cervical tissues, the stroma was not immunostained, whereas
the basal and parabasal epithelial layers were slightly reactive
[Fig. 1A (i and ii)]. In cases with low-grade SILs (LSIL) and
high-grade SILs (HSIL), faint immunostaining was observed in
the stroma [Fig. 1A (iii–vi))] However, in cervical cancer
tissues, HB-EGF was strongly immunostained in the stromal
region [Fig. 1A (vii–xii)]. An irrelevant antibody did not
immunostain the stroma, whereas a similar immunostaining
pattern was observed with other anti-HB-EGF monoclonal
antibodies (ref. 27; data not shown).
To evaluate the relationships between stromal HB-EGF
immunostaining and clinical features, the cases with positive

HB-EGF produced by fibroblasts contributes to ME180
cell proliferation in a coculture system
The effect of stromal HB-EGF on cervical cancer cell
proliferation was examined by coculture of ME180 cells with
CCF1 cells derived from cervical cancer–associated fibroblasts
(Fig. 2A). Because growth promotion by HB-EGF is masked in
common monolayer culture (13), ME180 cells were embedded
in collagen gel using cell culture inserts. These inserts have 0.4mm diameter pores in the membrane, so that soluble factors
can pass between the 2 chambers. The proliferation of ME180
cells was largely enhanced by coculture with CCF1 cells
compared with ME180 cells cultured alone. ME180 cells,
cocultured with CCF1 cells, formed larger cell colonies than
ME180 cells without CCF1 cells (Fig. 2B). The total cell number
of ME180 cells produced when cocultured with CCF1 cells was
about 5 times greater than that of ME180 cells cultured alone
(Fig. 2C). The enhanced cell growth by coculture with CCF1
cells was almost abrogated by an anti-HB-EGF neutralizing
antibody, whereas growth inhibition by an anti-HB-EGF antibody was not observed in ME180 cells cultured alone
(Fig. 2C). CRM197, which inhibits the mitogenic activity of
HB-EGF (28), inhibited the cell growth of ME180 cells in the
coculture system, but did not affect the growth of ME180 cells
cultured alone (Fig. 2D). An EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, also
strongly inhibited the cell growth of ME180 cells in the
coculture system but did not significantly affect the growth
of ME180 cells cultured alone (Fig. 2E).
Enhanced proliferation by coculture with CCF1 cells was
similarly observed in another cervical cancer cell line, CaSki
cells, and the enhancement was inhibited by CRM197 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Enhanced proliferation of ME180 cells
was also observed in coculture with MEF cells. ME180 cells
were cocultured with either MEF cells derived from a wildtype mouse (MEF-HBþ/þ) or MEF cells derived from an HBEGF KO mouse (MEF-HB/). The total cell number of ME180
cells produced when cocultured with MEF-HBþ/þ cells was
about 8.5 times higher than that of ME180 cells cocultured with
MEF-HB/ cells (Fig. 2F). Thus, ME180 cell proliferation was
enhanced by coculture with CCF or MEF cells, and HB-EGF
produced by fibroblasts contributed to this enhancement.
The coculture experiments suggested that HB-EGF promotes ME180 cell proliferation by acting directly on ME180
cells through phosphorylation of their EGFR. However, it is

Thus, sHB-EGF might be deposited at the ECM-enriched
stromal region, even though HB-EGF is not synthesized in
stromal cells. To clarify which cells produce HB-EGF, cervical
cancer cells, or cancer-surrounding stroma cells, the transcription levels of HB-EGF in cancer epithelium and stromal
regions were determined by quantitative reverse transcription
PCR using microdissected frozen tissues as described in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods. For these assays,
tissues from SCCs and adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix
were examined. As shown in Fig. 1C, HB-EGF mRNA was
higher in the stroma than in the epithelium in total cervical
cancer tissues (n ¼ 7, P ¼ 0.009) and in SCCs (n ¼ 5, P ¼ 0.015),
indicating that HB-EGF is mainly produced by stroma cells of
cervical cancer lesions.

also possible that HB-EGF acts on fibroblasts and indirectly
enhances ME180 cell proliferation. To address this point, we
carried out the following sets of experiments: First, addition of
HB-EGF to the medium was found to enhance ME180 cell
proliferation in the absence of CCF1 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Second, examination of EGFR expression and its
phosphorylation revealed that ME180 cells expressed abundant EGFR and that its phosphorylation level was enhanced by
coculture with CCF1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Third,

HB-EGF and Cervical Cancer

completely diminished the enhanced cell growth by coculture
with CCF1 cells (Fig. 2G). These results indicate that HB-EGF
directly enhances ME180 cell proliferation in coculture conditions through activation of EGFR on ME180 cells. HB-EGF
binds to ErbB4, as well as to EGFR. However, ME180 cells
had very low expression of ErbB4 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
dnEGFR expression in ME180 cells completely inhibited the
enhanced proliferation by coculture with CCF1 cells. Thus,
ErbB4 is unlikely to contribute to this process.
Cotransplantation of fibroblasts enhances tumor
growth in ME180 cells
To assess the contribution of fibroblasts and HB-EGF
expressed in fibroblasts on tumor growth in vivo, we carried
out cotransplantation experiments of ME180 cells with CCF or
MEF cells into athymic nude mice. In the initial set of
experiments, ME180 cells were used alone or mixed with
various CCF cells (CCF1, CCF2, and CCF3) isolated from
the cervical cancer stromata of different patients. Compared
with ME180 cells alone, coinjection of ME180 cells with CCF1,
CCF2, or CCF3 cells produced significantly larger tumors
(Fig. 3A). The histology of the tumors showed a prominent
stromal compartment, resembling SCC tissues of uterine
cervical cancer (Fig. 3B). Immunostaining with an anti-human
HB-EGF antibody showed the presence of human HB-EGF in
fibroblasts surrounding the ME180 cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, the
CCF cells enhanced the growth of ME180 cells in a mouse
xenograft model to form tumors that were histologically
similar to human uterine cervical cancer.
The enhanced tumor growth of ME180 cells by CCF cells
was also examined by monitoring the tumor size using
fluorescence imaging. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled ME180 (ME180/GFP) cells were subcutaneously transplanted with or without CCF1 cells into nude mice. Consistent
with the results shown in Fig. 3A, fluorescence imaging
confirmed that ME180 cell proliferation in the mouse xenograft model was enhanced by cotransplantation of CCF cells
(Fig. 3C and D).
To examine whether stromal HB-EGF contributed to
the enhanced tumor growth of the cervical cancer cells,
ME180/GFP cells were mixed with either Ds-Red–labeled
MEF-HB/ (MEF-HB//Red) or Ds-Red–labeled MEFHBþ/þ (MEF-HBþ/þ/Red) cells and the mixtures were transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice. As shown in Fig. 3E
and F, the tumors formed by ME180/GFP cells cotransplanted with MEF-HBþ/þ/Red cells were approximately
twice as large as those formed by ME180/GFP cells cotransplanted with MEF-HB//Red cells after 21 days. The latter
tumors were similar in size to ME180 cells transplanted
alone (see Fig. 3A and E), indicating that MEF-HB//Red
cells did not enhance ME180 cell tumor growth. These
results suggest that HB-EGF expressed in fibroblasts played
a major role in accelerating the growth of ME180 cells in
this mouse xenograft model.
Both hematoxylin and eosin and immunofluorescence
staining (Fig. 3F) indicated that Ds-Red–positive MEF cells
(red) were incorporated into the ME180/GFP tumors (green)
in both the MEF-HBþ/þ/Red and MEF-HB//Red transplan-

tation experiments. Necrotic fields were more prevalent inside
the tumor tissue when MEF-HB//Red cells were cotransplanted, compared with MEF-HBþ/þ/Red cells, suggesting
enhanced angiogenesis due to HB-EGF. Interestingly, the
fluorescence intensity of ME180/GFP cells cotransplanted
with MEF-HBþ/þ/Red cells tended to be higher than that of
ME180/GFP cells cotransplanted with MEF-HB//Red cells.
GFP synthesis in the former combination might have resulted
from a more abundant supply of nutrients and oxygen, given
the enhanced angiogenesis in these tumors.
PDGF secreted by cervical cancer cells induces HB-EGF
expression in fibroblasts
HB-EGF staining was preferentially observed at the stromal
regions contacting the cancer invasion front. This suggested
that cervical cancer cells might provide certain factors to the
cancer-surrounding fibroblasts to induce the expression of
HB-EGF and that fibroblasts could respond to these factors
and upregulate HB-EGF mRNA synthesis. To test this hypothesis, conditioned media (CM) prepared from cervical cancer
cell lines were added to the fibroblast primary cultures. When
CM from CaSki or ME180 cells was added to CCF1 cells, the
HB-EGF mRNA levels in CCF1 cells were markedly upregulated (Fig. 4A). Moderate upregulation was observed with CM
from HeLa cells, whereas no upregulation was observed with
CM from TCS or NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4A). Enhanced HB-EGF
mRNA expression by ME180 CM was observed in CCF2 and
CCF3 cells as well as in CCF1 cells but not in ME180 cells
themselves (Fig. 4B). Upregulation of HB-EGF mRNA expression was observed 3 hours after the addition of CM and peaked at 6 to 9 hours (Fig. 4C). Western blot analysis of CCF1 cell
lysates confirmed the induction of HB-EGF protein synthesis
by ME180 CM but not by control CM from CCF1 cells (Fig. 4D).
Examination of the expression levels of other EGFR ligands
revealed that ME180 CM preferentially induced HB-EGF expression in CCF1 cells, although HeLa CM slightly induced
epiregulin expression in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
These results indicate that CM from cervical cancer cell lines
specifically induced HB-EGF among the EGFR family of
growth factors in CCF cells.
To characterize the putative HB-EGF inducer in CM from
ME180 cells, various inhibitors were tested to see whether they
could prevent the induction of HB-EGF expression in CCF1
cells. FGF, insulin-like growth factor, PDGF, and TGFb are
known to be secreted by carcinoma cells to activate CAF cells.
An FGF/VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PD173074,
did not inhibit HB-EGF expression in CCF1 cells, whereas the
insulin-like growth factor receptor inhibitor AGL2263 and
TGFb RI kinase inhibitor II partially inhibited HB-EGF mRNA
synthesis. In contrast, the PDGF receptor inhibitor AG1295
completely inhibited HB-EGF expression (Fig. 5A), suggesting
that PDGF contributed to the HB-EGF induction in CCF cells.
PDGF is composed of heterodimers or homodimers of 4 subtypes. To test whether PDGF could induce HB-EGF expression
in CCF1 cells, various forms of PDGF were added to CCF1 cell
cultures. PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and PDGF-DD induced HB-EGF
expression in CCF1 cells, whereas PDGF-AA and PDGF-CC
almost had no effect (Fig. 5B). Western blot analysis confirmed

that ME180 cells produced PDGF-BB (Fig. 5C). Consistent with
this result, CCF1 cells produced PDGFRb (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Moreover, tissue sections stained with anti-PDGFB and anti-PDGFRb antibodies indicated that these proteins
were localized in cancer cells and the cancer-surrounding
stromal region, respectively, in a mouse xenograft model
coinjected with ME180 and CCF1 cells (Fig. 5D).
The PDGF receptor inhibitors AG1295 (Fig. 6A) and imatinib (Fig. 6B) prevented the enhanced proliferation of ME180
cells by coculture with CCF1 cells but did not inhibit ME180
cell proliferation when the cells were cultured alone (Fig. 6A

by ME180 cells was followed by ubiquitin-dependent degradation (29). Furthermore, the expression of dnPDGFRb, but
not that of dnEGFR, in CCF1 cells or MEF cells reduced the
enhanced proliferation of ME180 cells by coculture with CCF1
or MEF cells (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that PDGF-BB
does not contribute directly to ME180 cell growth but indirectly stimulates ME180 cell growth by inducing fibroblasts to
produce HB-EGF. Fig. 6C also shows that dnEGFR expression
in fibroblasts did not inhibit the enhanced proliferation of
ME180 cells in coculture, confirming that EGFR ligands did
not directly cause the activation of CCF or MEF cells.
In addition to the induced expression of HB-EGF by PDGF,
HB-EGF also enhanced PDGF expression in ME180 cells. As
shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C), PDGF-BB synthesis

Discussion
Elevated levels of EGFR are associated with a poor prognosis for patients with cervical cancer, suggesting that the
EGFR signaling pathway plays an important role in cancer
progression (30–32). Here, we focused on HB-EGF expression
and its growth-promoting activity in cervical cancer cells.
Immunohistochemical and laser microdissection analyses
revealed that HB-EGF was expressed in cancer-associated
stroma but not in cancer epithelial cells. HB-EGF accumulated
in CAF cells proximal to the cancer invasion front, although
other types of cells might also express HB-EGF. Therefore, we
investigated the role of stromal HB-EGF in cancer cell growth
using in vitro coculture assays. ME180 cell and CaSki-cell

Figure 7. A model of cancer cell–stromal fibroblast interactions in the
cervix. PDGF-BB produced by a cervical cancer cell upregulates HB-EGF
through PDGFRb activation in an adjacent fibroblast, which in turn
facilitates cancer cell growth by activating EGFR. HB-EGF also induces
PDGF synthesis in the cervical cancer cell. The paracrine loop can be
blocked with inhibitors.

proliferation was greatly enhanced in the presence of CCF
cells. An anti-HB-EGF–neutralizing antibody or CRM197
inhibited these effects. CRM197 not only inhibits the mitogenic activity of HB-EGF but also prevents its protein synthesis in cells that express high levels of pro-HB-EGF (33). No
effects were observed on protein synthesis in CCF1 cells and
ME180 cells at the concentration of CRM197 used here.
Growth promotion of ME180 cells was also observed by
coculture with MEF-HBþ/þ cells but not with MEF-HB/
cells. Thus, HB-EGF expressed in CCF or MEF cells promoted
ME180 cell proliferation in this coculture system. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first report that HB-EGF
expressed in CAF promotes epithelial cancer cell growth.
Coinjection of CCF cells with ME180 cells enhanced tumor
formation by ME180 cells in an athymic nude mouse model.
Similarly, MEF-HBþ/þ cells enhanced the proliferation of
ME180 cells much more than MEF-HB/ cells. These results
indicate that HB-EGF expressed in stromal cells enhances
cancer cell growth in vivo, consistent with the results of
our coculture assays. However, as HB-EGF is known to be
involved in tumor angiogenesis (34, 35), the growth-enhancing
effect of CCF or MEF cells in vivo might have been partly
caused by the indirect growth-promoting effect of HB-EGF via
neovascularization.
Another point we stress is that cervical cancer cells can
produce a factor that induces HB-EGF synthesis in fibroblasts.
Because PDGF is expressed in cervical cancer cells, we suspect
that it is a candidate, although other factors may also contribute to this process. PDGF did not induce cancer cell
growth itself but induced HB-EGF synthesis in CCF cells.
Consequently, AG1295 and imatinib inhibited tumor growth
by ME180 cells cocultured with CCF cells. Interestingly, addition of HB-EGF to ME180 cells in the absence of fibroblasts

HB-EGF and Cervical Cancer

resulted in increased PDGF production. These results indicate
that cancer epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts interact
reciprocally through PDGF and HB-EGF to form a positive
feedback loop. PDGF ligands produced by cancerous epithelial
cells stimulate the PDGFR-expressing stroma to upregulate
the synthesis of FGFs, thereby promoting angiogenesis and
epithelial-cell proliferation in a genetically-engineered mouse
model (5). Therefore, not just a single growth factor system,
but multiple systems could contribute to cancer–stroma
interactions in cervical cancers.
Immunohistochemistry indicated that HB-EGF was localized at the stromal region proximal to the invasion front of
cancerous epithelia. HB-EGF enhances cell motility as well as
cell proliferation (11, 36), suggesting that HB-EGF contributes
to the invasion and metastasis of cancerous epithelia. Membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), which is
involved in the degradation of ECM proteins, is believed to
play an important role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis
(37). MT1-MMP is expressed in cervical cancer cells, and its
expression increases with cervical tumor progression (38).
Invasion assays in collagen gel cultures showed that an
EGF signal, in addition to MT1-MMP, is required for inducing
keratinocyte invasiveness. We previously reported that MT1MMP cleaves the N-terminal region of HB-EGF to convey
enhanced mitogenic activity (39). Therefore, such processing
of the N-terminal region of HB-EGF at the invasion front of
cancer cells by MT1-MMP could be a cause of cervical cancer
invasion.

There are several reports indicating a positive correlation
between HB-EGF expression and cancer progression (24, 40,
41). In most of these cases, HB-EGF was upregulated in
cancerous cells. Here, we showed that HB-EGF is produced
in CAF and does not originate from cancer cells. The CAFproduced HB-EGF enhanced cancer cell proliferation. There
is a report that HB-EGF plays a role in tumor progression in
pericytes in a mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumorigenesis (35). Therefore, HB-EGF might contribute to
cancer progression by various means. Although the development of therapeutic strategies targeting HB-EGF is only
beginning, the combination of an HB-EGF inhibitor with other
therapeutic agents, including PDGF inhibitors or MT1-MMP
inhibitors, could lead to effective treatments for patients with
refractory cancers.
