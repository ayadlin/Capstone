Abstract
Castration resistance in prostate cancer (PCa) constitutes an advanced, aggressive disease with poor
prognosis, associated with uncontrolled cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and enhanced invasive
potential. The molecular mechanisms involved in the transition of PCa to castration resistance are obscure. Here, we report that the nonselective cationic channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 2
(TRPV2) is a distinctive feature of castration-resistant PCa. TRPV2 transcript levels were higher in patients
with metastatic cancer (stage M1) compared with primary solid tumors (stages T2a and T2b). Previous
studies of the TRPV2 channel indicated that it is primarily involved in cancer cell migration and not in
cell growth. Introducing TRPV2 into androgen-dependent LNCaP cells enhanced cell migration along with
expression of invasion markers matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and cathepsin B. Consistent with the
likelihood that TRPV2 may affect cancer cell aggressiveness by influencing basal intracellular calcium levels, small interfering RNA–mediated silencing of TRPV2 reduced the growth and invasive properties of
PC3 prostate tumors established in nude mice xenografts, and diminished expression of invasive enzymes
MMP2, MMP9, and cathepsin B. Our findings establish a role for TRPV2 in PCa progression to the aggressive castration-resistant stage, prompting evaluation of TRPV2 as a potential prognostic marker and
therapeutic target in the setting of advanced PCa. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1225–35. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Androgen ablation is initially beneficial to nearly all men
suffering from prostate cancer (PCa) because androgendependent PCa cells undergo apoptotic death induced by such
treatment (1). Unfortunately, androgen ablation is only palliative and patients relapse into castration-resistant PCa with
dramatic consequences (2). Indeed, androgen-independent
PCa cells do not enter the programmed cell death pathway
following androgen ablation (3). Thus, the major reason for
the ability of PCa cells to metastasize and kill the patient is
not related to their rate of proliferation but to their extensive
ability to survive once they have been disseminated to a distant site (4). These cells represent an androgen-insensitive and
apoptosis-resistant cell phenotype in the prostate (5), and
their abundance correlates with tumor malignancy, loss of

sensitivity to androgens, and poor prognosis (6, 7). In addition,
the emergence of castration-resistant phenotype is concomitant with an increase in overall tumor growth and progression
associated with enhanced level of cell migration (8). However,
the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling hormone
refractoriness, apoptosis resistance, and migration of these
cells are only partially understood (9). Among the different
mechanisms regulating cancer cell migration, those that
involve calcium dependence have been supposed to play
a primary role (10, 11). The family of transient receptor
potential (TRP) cationic protein channels displaying extraordinarily diverse activation mechanisms (12) has recently received increasing attention, in particular, to their
link to human diseases (13–15). Some of these TRP channels have been reported to be involved in cancerogenesis:
TRPM1 in melanoma (13) and TRPV6 and TRPM8 in PCa

(15–17). Among them, the TRP vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) channel is the one for which the mechanisms of regulation or
the role in carcinogenesis is not known thus far. Recent
studies have shown that mRNA of TRPV2 is expressed in
prostate (18). TRPV2 function may be regulated by some
lysophospholipids identified and known to have a range
of physiologic and pathologic effects, including stimulation
of cancer cell migration (19–21). However, the question remains as to how TRPV2 is involved in tumor development
and progression both in vitro and in vivo to an extremely
aggressive castration-resistant stage and whether it could
be a real hallmark of poor prognosis in patients suffering
from PCa.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The androgen-dependent human PCa cell
line LNCaP and androgen-independent human PCa cell lines
LNCaP C4-2, DU145, and PC3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in culture in
RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS
(Seromed, Poly-Labo), 5 mmol/L L-glutamine (Sigma), and
100 μg/mL kanamycin.
Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Before fluorescence measurements, the cells
were trypsinized and transferred onto glass coverslips. Cells
were used 2 to 4 d after trypsinization. The medium was replaced every 48 h.
Generation of shTRPV2 vectors. Hybridized oligonucleotides were cloned into pSilencer 4.1-CMV-puro vector (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions and defined
as shTRPV2 I (sense, 5′-GGTAAGACGTGCCTGATGA-3′) and
shTRPV2 II (sense, 5′-TAAGAGTCAACCTCAACTA-3′).
Nucleofection. Transfection of LNCaP or PC3 cells with
TRPV2-GFP or with shTRPV2 I or II was carried out using
Nucleofector (Amaxa GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 3 μg of vector were transfected
into 2 millions of trypsinized cells, which then were plated
into a T75 flask or onto the glass coverslips for 72 h.
Small interfering RNA transfection. LNCaP and LNCaP
C4-2 cells were transfected with 50 nmol/L small interfering
RNA (siRNA) against TRPV2 (siTRPV2; synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc.) using 6 μL TransIT-TKO transfection reagent
(Mirus, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions (see
Table 1 for the siRNA sequence).
Ca2+ measurements using Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester.
Before fluorescence measurements, the cells were trypsinized
and plated onto glass slips. The medium was replaced every
48 h. Cells were used 3 d after trypsinization. The culture medium was replaced by a HBSS solution containing 142 mmol/L
NaCl, 5.6 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L CaCl2,
0.34 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 0.44 mmol/L KH2PO4, 10 mmol/L
HEPES, and 5.6 mmol/L glucose. The osmolarity and pH of
this solution were adjusted to 310 mOsm/L and 7.4, respectively. When a calcium-free medium was required, CaCl2 was
omitted and replaced by equimolar MgCl2. Dye loading was
achieved by transferring the cells into a standard HBSS solu-

tion containing 1 mmol/L Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Calbiochem) loaded (45 min) for 40 min at 37°C, as described
previously (11), using a photomultiplier-based system (Photon
Technologies) and a double-wavelength (340 and 380 nm)
excitation protocol to quantify the absolute value of calcium concentration (22). All recordings were made at 37°C.
The cells were continuously perfused with HBSS solution
via a whole-chamber perfusion system. The flow rate of
the whole-chamber perfusion system was set to 1 mL/min
and the chamber volume was 500 mL. The basal Ca2+ was
measured using HBSS solutions containing 0 and 2 mmol/L
Ca2+. The relative increase in [Ca2+]cyt was measured following consecutive switch from free Ca2+ medium to 2 mmol/L
Ca2+ medium.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total mRNA was isolated
from cells as previously described (23). DNA amplification
conditions included an initial denaturation step of 7 min at
95°C; 36 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 60°C, and 30 s at 72°C;
and finally 7 min at 72°C. Primers used are listed in Table 1.
Antibody production. Rabbit polyclonal antibody antiTRPV2 was produced in the laboratory headed by Dr. Rassendren (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR
5203, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale U661, Montpellier, France). The polypeptide ASEENYVPVQLLQS corresponding to 740 to 763 amino acids of
the COOH-terminal sequence of the human TRPV2 channel
(NM_016113) was injected into rabbit to produce a polyclonal anti-TRPV2 antibody.
Fluorescence experiments. LNCaP cells nucleofected with
TRPV2-GFP were washed twice with PBS and subjected to
fluorescence analysis using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and analysis software (AIM 3.2, Zeiss), as previously
described (23).
Western blotting. The experiments were carried out as described previously (19). Membranes were reblotted twice:
first with the anti-NSE mouse monoclonal antibody (1:250;
Dako) and then with the anti–β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:500; NeoMarkers).
Migration assay. Cells were seeded onto the top of Transwell cell culture inserts with 8.0-μm pore size (Falcon) at a
density of 30,000 per well (24-well format) in serum-free
culture medium. Cells were stimulated to migrate across
the filters by providing 10% FCS as a chemoattractant in
the assay chambers beneath the inserts. After 2 h, almost
two thirds of the cells were adherent to each filter in the
inserts. After 26 h of incubation at 37°C, nonmigratory cells
were removed from the top of the filter by scraping, whereas
cells that had migrated through the filter pores to the lower
face of the inserts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS
and stained with Hoechst (5 mg/L in PBS). Cells under each
filter were counted on five random examination fields (×200)
using a Leica DMIRB. Data are expressed as means of four
wells ± SE.
Cell proliferation assay. Cells were plated at the initial
density of 500 per well for PC3 cells and 2,500 per well for
LNCaP cells in 96-well plates (Poly-Labo). After 48 h, cells
were cultured in the treatment medium (day 0). From day
0, half of the medium was changed daily for each condition.

Implication of TRPV2 in Prostate Cancer

The CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation
Assay (Promega Corp.) was used to determine the number of
viable cells (11).
Cancer tissue sampling and total RNA extraction. After
informed consent, patients with clear localized T2a and T2b
stages of PCa for whom a prostatectomy has been scheduled,
as well as patients with metastatic PCa having a stage M1
who were previously subjected to androgen ablation therapy,
have been included in a clinical research program (protocol
ID: 2897) funded by the Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg (Strasbourg, France). A total volume of 3 mL of bone
marrow was aspirated at a scintigraphic-indicated metastatic
site. Microscopic observations were made from an aliquot of
each bone marrow aspirate to confirm the presence of metastatic PCa cells. Total RNAs were extracted from small pieces
of localized tumor by the use of the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen)
and from bone marrow aspirates by the use of the QIAamp
RNA Blood kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nine samples from both localized and metastatic PCa
were used in our study.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR
of TRPV2 mRNA transcript was done using MESA GREEN
qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR Assay (Eurogentec) on the
Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System. The sequence of primers is indicated in Table 1. The 18S rRNA gene
was used as an endogenous control to normalize variations
in RNA extractions, the degree of RNA degradation, and variability in RT efficiency. To quantify the results, we used the
comparative threshold cycle method described by Livak and
Schmittgen (24).
Animals, siRNA injection, and tumorigenicity assays.
Studies involving animals, including housing and care, method of euthanasia, and experimental protocols, were conducted in accordance with the local animal ethical
committee in the Institut André Lwoff in Villejuif, France.
Tumor cells (2 × 106 per mouse) were injected s.c. in 50%
(v/v) Matrigel (BD Biosciences) to 6- to 8-wk-old male nude

mice. Once tumors were exponentially growing, mice were
randomized for treatment (at least six animals per group)
and received daily i.p. either siRNA control (siCTL) or
siTRPV2 at a dose of 120 μg/kg diluted in PBS. Mice were
sacrificed after 17 d of treatment, and tumors were dissected
and weighed.
Data analysis. Results were expressed as mean ± SE. Plots
were produced using Origin 7.0 (MicroCal Software, Inc.).
Each experiment was repeated at least three times. n indicates the number of the cells per experiment. N indicates
the number of experiments performed. The Turkey-Kramer
test was used for statistical comparison among means and
differences, and P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
TRPV2 channel expression and function in human PCa
cell lines. We have studied the expression of TRPV2 channel
in the androgen-dependent human PCa cell line LNCaP,
the androgen-independent human PCa cell line LNCaP C42 derived from androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, and the
castration-resistant human PCa cell lines DU145 and PC3
(Fig. 1A).
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) TRPV2 I and II (PC3 shV2 I
and II) were nucleofected into PC3 cells to specifically inhibit
the expression of TRPV2 (Fig. 1B). TRPV2 knockdown with
shTRPV2 I or II in PC3 cells led to significant suppression
of both mRNA and protein of TRPV2 and NSE (Fig. 1B).
We have shown that the proliferation rate of PC3 cells treated with shTRPV2 I or II evaluated during 6 days is not statistically different as compared with PC3 pSilencer–treated
cells (N = 4; Fig. 1C). However, the cell migration is decreased
in PC3 cells treated with shTRPV2 I or II (59 ± 11 cells for
PC3 shTRPV2 I and 58 ± 12 cells for PC3 shTRPV2 II, n =
4, N = 4; Fig. 1C) than in PC3 pSilencer cells (89 ± 5 cells,
n = 4, N = 4). The basal [Ca2+]cyt in PC3 treated with shTRPV2
I or II is lower (120 ± 13 nmol/L and 110 ± 9 nmol/L, n = 120,

the cells were kept in Ca2+-free medium (data not shown).
TRPV2 channel contributes to hormone refractoriness of
LNCaP C4-2 cells. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR) was used to show that LNCaP C4-2 cells
express TRPV2 mRNA in the control (transfected with a

specifically silence TRPV2 mRNA, we transfected LNCaP C42 cells with 50 nmol/L siTRPV2 for 72 hours. We have also
shown that in LNCaP C4-2 cells treated with siTRPV2, the
NSE expression is downregulated (Fig. 2A). A Western blot
experiment was used to confirm that transfection with
50 nmol/L siTRPV2 for 72 hours drastically diminished the

in LNCaP C4-2 cells transfected with siCTL (73 ± 5 cells,

for several days of the treatment. We have shown that the
addition of Bt2cAMP and IBMX to the culture medium induces TRPV2 mRNA expression in LNCaP cells after only
8 hours of treatment (Fig. 4B). Further, the siTRPV2 transfection into these cells reduces TRPV2 and NSE mRNA expression

± 10 nmol/L and 78 ± 3 nmol/L, n = 120, N = 4 per condition,
respectively) in the presence of Ca2+ in the medium (Fig. 4D).
Cell transfection with siCTL does not significantly modify
the basal [Ca2+]cyt (135 ± 10 nmol/L for LNCaP treated with
Bt2cAMP and IBMX and 80 ± 6 nmol/L for LNCaP CTL, respectively, n = 120, N = 4 per condition) in the presence of
Ca2+ in the medium. It should be noted that transfection of
LNCaP cells with siTRPV2 had no effect on basal [Ca2+]cyt
(80 ± 3 nmol/L, n = 120, N = 4) in the presence of Ca2+ in
the medium. However, in LNCaP treated with Bt 2cAMP
and IBMX, the transfection with siTRPV2 significantly decreased the [Ca2+]cyt (96 ± 4 nmol/L, n = 120, N = 4) in the
presence of Ca2+ in the medium as compared with LNCaP
treated with Bt2cAMP and IBMX and transfected with siCTL.
TRPV2 gene expression increases in PCa metastasis and
is involved in tumor development in vivo. A quantitative
real-time PCR showed that mRNA expression is ∼12 times
higher in metastatic PCa samples than in localized PCa samples (n = 9 for each condition; Fig. 5A). The most pertinent
question was whether TRPV2 silencing could inhibit tumor
development in vivo. Previously, a RNA interference in vivo
has been used to show that the androgen receptor is still required for the development of castration-resistant prostate
tumors (25). Similarly, the model of mice bearing xenografted
PC3 cell–provoked tumors has been created. Then, the mice
were treated on a daily basis during 17 days with either siCTL

or siTRPV2 at a dose of 120 μg/kg diluted in PBS. The weight
of tumors was significantly smaller in mice treated with
siTRPV2 than in siCTL-treated animals (Fig. 5B). To search
for the mechanisms that might account for the profound
effect of TRPV2 knockdown on the tumors, such markers of
invasion as MMP2, MMP9, and cathepsin B were shown to
be substantially downregulated on the TRPV2 knockdown
in vivo (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
In the present study, we report three major findings that
allow the understanding of human PCa development and
progression to castration-resistant phenotype. We have
shown for the first time that (a) the PCa tumor progression
to castration-resistant phenotype is characterized by the expression de novo of a cationic nonselective TRPV2 channel,
which may be served as a reliable prognostic marker of the
most aggressive castration-resistant stage; (b) the role of
TRPV2 in cancer cells derived from castration-resistant tumors is to maintain an elevated level of cytosolic calcium
due to the constitutive activity of the channel; (c) the main
feature of the PCa metastatic cells—their ability to migrate
and invade the adjacent tissues—could be mediated by
TRPV2 activity via the direct regulation of such proteins as

Implication of TRPV2 in Prostate Cancer

MMP2, MMP9, and cathepsin B used by the cancer cell to
invade.
The fact that the hormone refractoriness of PCa is featured
by the emergence of malignant cell phenotypes characterized
by uncontrolled proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and
enhanced potential to invade has led us to the search of
some specific molecular intermediators helping PCa cells
to escape a natural regulation by hormones. In the context
of the present work, we report a nonselective cationic channel TRPV2 as a unique and distinguished feature of castration-resistant PCa. As the evidence, TRPV2 is ultimately
expressed in metastatic castration-resistant PCa samples
rather than in localized hormone-responsive PCa tumors. Indeed, until now, TRPV2 channel has never been associated
with the development and progression of PCa. Unlike some
other TRP channels (e.g., TRPM8 channel), the expression
of TRPV2 channel does not require the presence and/or
activation of an androgen receptor (26). Therefore, it
seems likely that TRPV2 expression being confined to the
castration-resistant phenotype, which is no longer under
AR control, may be used by the cancer cell to increase its
oncogenic potential.
It has been previously shown that TRPV2 channels were
constitutively activated in TRPV2-overexpressing cell systems and induced an increase in basal [Ca2+]cyt (27). Our
results show that the basal [Ca2+]cyt is higher in hormoneresistant PCa cell lines, which express TRPV2, as compared
with androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line, which does not
express TRPV2. This increase in calcium is ultimately mediated by TRPV2 because, on the one hand, this high level
may be achieved by TRPV2 transfection into LNCaP cells
and, on the other hand, shRNA of TRPV2 prevents calcium
increase. Thus, by increasing basal [Ca2+]cyt, which is apparently temporally and spatially regulated in the cancer cell,
TRPV2 channels contribute to the progression to castrationresistant phenotype.
The transition of PCa cells to hormone-insensitive phenotype is a common feature of human prostate carcinoma (28,
29) and the appearance of neuroendocrine markers is considered to be associated with a poor prognosis and reduced
long-term survival (30). We have shown that TRPV2 expression is associated with the NSE expression in PC3 and
LNCaP C4-2 cells. It has been already shown that other neuroendocrine cell markers, PGP9.5 and chromogranin A, are
expressed in PCa derived from metastatic (lymph node and
bone) adenocarcinomas, suggesting that these cells had undergone specific PCa neuroendocrine differentiation (31).
This is usually accompanied by the loss of a nuclear androgen receptor (5) or, in the case of LNCaP C4-2, by the loss
of androgen sensitivity (32). Both steroid deprivation and
Bt2cAMP and IBMX treatments were used to restore in
the experimental conditions the consequences of androgen
ablation therapy in men in vivo. Interestingly, both treatments resulted in the expression of TRPV2 channels in
androgen-deprived LNCaP cells, in increase in cytosolic
calcium levels, and in overexpression of NSE. The latter has
already been used as a marker because serum NSE in metastatic PCa patients who underwent endocrine therapy is sig-

nificantly higher than that in nonmetastatic patients (33).
Our data were confirmed by the clinical in vivo studies using
the biopsies of the patients subjected to hormone ablation
therapy and who finally developed a castration-resistant
metastatic PCa.
TRPV2 was suggested to be a physiologic sensor of hot
temperatures (34). It is also expressed in nonneuronal cells,
such as prostate cells (19, 35), or in human blood cells, suggesting that, in addition to its role as a noxious heat sensor
(34), this channel may encompass other cellular functions
(36). One of such function of TRPV2 in cancer cells is the
control of cell migration. As we have shown, TRPV2 is primarily involved in PCa cell migration and not in cell proliferation. TRPV2 silencing drastically decreased the migration
of the cancer cells derived from castration-resistant tumors
and that TRPV2 overexpression increased cell migration of
androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Such a promigrative role
of TRPV2 has been also previously shown on macrophage
cells (37). To have an insight into the possible molecular
mechanisms responsible for TRPV2-induced enhanced potential to invade, such markers of invasion as MMP2,
MMP9, and cathepsin B (38–40) were studied. We have
shown that the expression of the above enzymes directly
participating in the process of invasion is strongly dependent on TRPV2 expression. Indeed, the transfection of
TRPV2 channel into androgen-dependent LNCaP cells induces the expression of MMP9 and cathepsin B, and at
the same time, the siRNA knockdown in vivo leads to progressive downregulation of these markers in the xenografted tumors.
Moreover, our data obtained in vivo using a nude mice xenograft model show that TRPV2 silencing in mice bearing
TRPV2-expressing PC3 cell tumors significantly decreased
the tumor weight, suggesting that tumors void of TRPV2
channel are likely to undergo necrosis. The fact that siRNA
against particular target does not inhibit cancer cell proliferation or is implicated in cell survival in vitro, preserving its
strong antitumor effects in vivo, comes from the specific suppression of this cancer cell migration. Indeed, the continuous
cell division inside of the tumor without any possibility to
invade the host in addition to restriction in oxygen and nutrition element supply leads eventually to tissue necrosis (see
ref. 41 for review).
Thus, the involvement of TRPV2 in the invasion process by
enhancing cell migration is evident for more aggressive PCa
cells and therefore seems vital for the PCa tumor in general.
In conclusion, we have discovered a new feature of castration-resistant PCa characterized by de novo expression of
a nonselective cationic TRPV2 channel. The latter has been
shown to manifest its activity via maintaining an elevated
intracellular calcium concentration. As a result of TRPV2
function, it contributes to enhanced cancer cell migration by
induction of key proteases—MMP2, MMP9, cathepsin B—and
is necessary for castration-resistant tumor development and
progression, as we have shown in vivo. Thus, TRPV2 channel
could be a prospective prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for future interventions to increase the life
expectancy of the patients.
