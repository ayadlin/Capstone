ABSTRACT
Deubiquitinating enzyme USP7 has been involved in the pathogenesis and
progression of several cancers. Targeting USP7 is becoming an attractive strategy
for cancer therapy. In this study, we identified synthetic triterpenoid C-28 methyl
ester of 2-cyano-3, 12-dioxoolen-1, 9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me) as a novel inhibitor
of USP7 but not of other cysteine proteases such as cathepsin B and cathepsin D.
CDDO-Me inhibits USP7 activity via a mechanism that is independent of the presence
of α, β-unsaturated ketones. Molecular docking studies showed that CDDO-Me fits
well in the ubiquitin carboxyl terminus-binding pocket on USP7. Given that CDDO-Me
is known to be effective against ovarian cancer cells, we speculated that CDDO-Me
may target USP7 in ovarian cancer cells. We demonstrated that ovarian cancer cells
have higher USP7 expression than their normal counterparts. Knockdown of USP7
inhibits the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Using the
cellular thermal shift assay and the drug affinity responsive target stability assay, we
further demonstrated that CDDO-Me directly binds to USP7 in cells, which leads to
the decrease of its substrates such as MDM2, MDMX and UHRF1. CDDO-Me suppresses
ovarian cancer tumor growth in an xenograft model. In conclusion, we demonstrate
that USP7 is a novel target of ovarian cancer cells; targeting USP7 may contribute
to the anti-cancer effect of CDDO-Me. The development of novel USP7 selective
compounds based on the CDDO-Me-scaffold warrants further investigation.

INTRODUCTION

Protein ubiquitination is a dynamic reversible
process. Removal of ubiquitin (Ub) is performed by
deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which are grouped into
five structurally different DUB enzyme families. Ubiquitinspecific enzymes (USP) constitute the largest subfamily
of DUBs, with more than 60 human member proteins.
USPs can release poly-Ub chains from proteins targeted
for degradation, recycle monomeric Ub, liberate Ub from
Ub-fusion precursors, reverse regulatory ubiquitylation
and edit inappropriately ubiquitylated proteins [4–5].

Ovarian cancer is one of the most common
gynecological malignancies in women [1]. Despite great
advances in chemotherapy and surgical treatment of this
disease, the 5-year survival remains approximately 36%
[2]. Over 80% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer
will relapse and eventually die of their disease [3]. Thus,
identification of novel target to conquer this disease is
urgently required.

USPs, such as USP1 [6], USP2 [7], USP7 [8], USP9x
[9] and USP14 [10], were recently shown to contribute
to the development of cancer and are emerging as novel
cancer drug targets [11–12]. USP7, also known as herpesassociated USP, has been found to be critical in cancer
progression because of its influence on the stability of the
tumor suppressor p53 [13]. USP7 has a higher binding
affinity for MDM2, thereby causing MDM2 stabilization
via the antagonisation of its autoubiquitination and the
consequent induction of p53 degradation. Therefore, the
inhibition of USP7 is predicted to destabilise MDM2 and
stabilize p53. Additional substrates of USP7 have been
reported; these substrates include claspin [14], FOXO4
[15], PTEN [16], UHRF1 [17]. USP7 exerts both p53dependent and p53-independent effects on controlling
cell proliferation and apoptosis, thereby making USP7 as
an attractive target for cancer therapy [8]. However, the
possible role of USP7 in ovarian cancer is not yet clear.
Triterpenoids are biosynthesized in plants by the
cyclization of squalene. They are used for medicinal
purposes in several Asian countries. In addition, ursolic and
oleanolic acids have anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective
and anti-tumor activities [18]. The C-28 methyl ester of
2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolen-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me)
is a novel synthetic oleanane triterpenoid. CDDO-Me is
currently in the late stages of clinical development for the
treatment of chronic kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy)
[19–21]. CDDO-Me exhibits cytotoxicity against various
cancer cells, including ovarian cancer [22–23]. However,
the underlying mechanism of anti-ovarian cancer activity
of CDDO-Me is not well understood.
In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that
CDDO-Me inhibits USP7 activity by directly interacting
with the protein. Furthermore, targeting USP7 contributed
to CDDO-Me-induced ovarian cancer cell death,
suggesting that USP7 is a novel drug target in ovarian
cancer cells.

on cathepsin B and cathepsin D. Even at a concentration
of 100 μM, CDDO-Me could not significantly inhibit the
activity of cathepsin B and cathepsin D (Figure 1D, 1E).
By contrast, E64 and pepstatin A, which are known
inhibitors of cathepsin B and cathepsin D, markedly
inhibited the activities of cathepsin B and cathepsin D
(Figure 1D, 1E). Moreover, we examined the effect of
CDDO-Me on other deubiquitiating enzymes with the
similar structure to USP7. Interestingly, CDDO-Me also
has inhibitory activity against USP2 with IC50 at 22.33 µM
(Supplementary Figure S1). Together, these data show that
CDDO-Me could inhibit USP7 activity in vitro, but does
not inhibit palpain-like enzymes.

CDDO-Me inhibits USP7 activity independent of
the Michael acceptor in the A ring
We next tried to determine the mode of action of
CDDO-Me on USP7. CDDO-Me has two electrophilic
Michael acceptor sites in the A and C rings. CDDO-Me
can interact with proteins containing structurally available
redox-sensitive cysteine residues such as IKK, STAT3 [24].
Given that USP7 is a cysteine protein, we hypothesized
that CDDO-Me may covalently bind to USP7 and inhibit
its activity in an irreversible manner. Unexpectedly, our
results showed that CDDO-Me inhibited USP7 activity in
a reversible manner (Figure 2A). Therefore, we suspected
that the two Michael acceptor sites may not be necessary
for the inhibitory effect of CDDO-Me. To address this, we
attempted to reduce the double bonds in the A and C rings
of CDDO-Me. However, we could only reduce the double
bond in the A ring could be (CDDO-MeR) (Figure 2B).
Interestingly, CDDO-MeR inhibited the USP7 activity at
concentrations similar to that of CDDO-Me (Figure 2C).
Moreover, preincubation with dithiothreitol (DTT) at
higher concentrations (40–80 mM) abrogated the activity
of CDDO-Me but not that of CDDO-MeR (Figure 2D).
These data suggest that CDDO-Me inhibits USP7 activity
via a mechanism independent of the presence of the
Michael acceptor site in the A ring.
The binding mode between USP7 and CDDOMe was further explored by molecular docking. The
predicted USP7-CDDO-Me complex showed that the
small molecule was bound to a narrow pocket near the
catalytic cleft (Supplementary Figure S2A). CDDOMe fits very well in this small pocket (Supplementary
Figure S2B), thereby leading to its stable binding with
USP7. The cyano group and the nearby carbonyl group
of the molecule formed hydrogen bonds with the Gln297
and Asp295 residues of USP7, respectively. In addition,
CDDO-Me had hydrophobic interactions with the Met292,
Tyr465, Phe409 and Tyr411 residues. In the USP7ubiquitin complex structure (PDB code: 1NBF), we found
that the same narrow pocket was occupied by the ubiquitin
C- terminus (Supplementary Figure S3). These results
suggest that the inhibition mechanism of CDDO-Me

RESULTS
CDDO-Me inhibits USP7 activity in vitro
In order to identify compounds with USP7
inhibitory activity, using the Ub-AMC protease assay,
we screened a small homemade compound library, which
is composed of some FDA approved drugs, compounds
entered in clinical trials and active natural compounds
(Supplementary Table S1). The results showed that
CDDO-Me (Figure 1A) markedly inhibited the USP7mediated cleavage of GST-UBA52 (Figure 1B) in an
in vitro gel-based assay. The IC50 of CDDO-Me for USP7
inhibition was 14.08  µM (Figure 1C). USP7 belongs
to cysteine protease, which including palpain-like
proteases (such as cathepsin B), caspase-like enzymes
and deubiquitinating enzymes. To see whether CDDOMe affects other cysteine protease, we measured its effect

may be explained by its displacement of the ubiquitin C
terminus while binding with USP7 [25–26]. However,
further experimental data, such as crystal structures, are
necessary to confirm this docking hypothesis.

Ovarian cancer tissues from non-neoplastic (n  =  10),
serous carcinoma (n  =  46), mucinous adenocarcinoma
(n = 15) and endometrioid carcinoma (n = 7) were stained
with anti-USP7 antibodies. As shown in Figure 3D, USP7
was localized to the nucleus of the respective tissues. In
general, ovarian cancer tissues expressed significantly
higher levels of USP7 compared with non-neoplastic tissue
(p < 0.001, Table 1). Moreover, an inverse relationship
was observed between the degree of differentiation and
USP7 expression: the lower the degree of differentiation,
the higher the USP7 expression (Figure 3D, Table 1,
p < 0.001). These data indicate that USP7 is expressed at
higher levels in ovarian cancer cells than in normal cells.

USP7 is expressed at a higher level in ovarian
cancer cells
CDDO-Me has been found to be effective in ovarian
cancers on tumor cell death [22–23, 27]. As CDDO-Me
could directly inhibit USP7 activity in vitro, we
hypothesized that USP7 may be a novel target of CDDO-Me
in ovarian cancer cells. Although overexpression of
USP7 has been observed in several types of cancer cells,
its association with ovarian cancer cells is unknown.
Therefore, we first examined the expression of USP7 in
ovarian cell lines. Compared with the non-tumorigenic
immortalized ovarian surface epithelial (IOSE) cells,
several ovarian cancer cell lines exhibit higher USP7
expression (Figure 3A, 3B). However, the expression
of USP2 is lower in these cell lines (Figure 3A, 3C).
Subsequently, we examined the expression of USP7
in ovarian cancer samples by immunohistochemistry.

Knockdown of USP7 inhibits proliferation of
ovarian cancer cells
To determine the role of USP7 in ovarian cancer
cells, USP7 was stably knocked down in HO8910 and
SKOV3 cells (Figure 4A, 4D). The vector-transfected
control cells and USP7 knockdown cells were
subcutaneously inoculated into nude mice, respectively.
As shown in Figure 4B and 4E, compared with the

Figure 1: CDDO-Me inhibits USP7 activity in vitro. (A) The chemical structure of CDDO-Me. (B) In an in vitro gel-based
USP7 activity assay, various concentrations of CDDO-Me were pre-incubated with 80 nM USP7 before GST-UBA52 was added. After
incubation, the reactions were stopped, and the products were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue
(G250), and the IC50 is 14.08 μM (C). (D–E) The effect of 50 and 100 μM CDDO-Me on the activity of cathepsin B (D) and cathepsin D (E)
were determined as described in the Materials and Methods section; 50 μM E64 (inhibitor of cathepsin B) and 50 μM pepstatin A (inhibitor
of cathepsin D) were used as positive controls. All experiments were performed at least three times with the same results.

non-specific shRNA (NC) transfected cells, knockdown
of USP7 (shUSP7) significantly inhibited tumor growth
in nude mice. Consistent with these observations, the
percentage of PCNA-positive cells significantly decreased,
whereas the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells
significantly increased in USP7-silenced cells (Figure 4C,
4F). These findings indicate the inhibition of proliferation
and increased cell death occurred upon USP7 knockdown.
Given that p53 is expressed in HO8910 cells but not in
SKOV3 cells [28–30], we observed an increase in p53
in the USP7-silenced HO8910 cells (Figure 4C,  4F).
Moreover, decrease of UHRF1 was observed in USP7
silenced cells (Figure 4C, 4F). These data suggest that
USP7 plays an important role in the proliferation and
survival of ovarian cancer cells.

(CETSA) was used in H08910 cells. CETSA is a
newly-developed method to evaluate drug binding to
target proteins in cells and tissue samples, which is based
on the biophysical principle of ligand-induced thermal
stabilization of target proteins [31–32]. Compared
to DMSO-treated cell lysate, CDDO-Me markedly
increased the thermal stability of USP7 at temperatures
examined (Figure 5A, 5B). We also tested whether USP7
stability during heating depended on the dose of CDDOMe. As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, USP7 accumulation
markedly increased as CDDO-Me concentration
increased. As a negative control, we demonstrated that
CDDO-Me did not increase the stability of vinculin
in cells. These data suggest that CDDO-Me directly
interacts with USP7 in cells. Consistent with the CETSA
results, the drug affinity responsive target stability
(DARTS) assay [33] also showed that the presence
of CDDO-Me partially prevents pronase-mediated
digestion of USP7 (Figure 5E). Furthermore, CDDO-Me
could compete with the binding of hemagglutinin [HA]tagged ubiquitin-vinyl sulfone (HA-Ub-VS), a DUBs
active site directed probe, to USP7 in a dose-dependent

activity of USP7 in ovarian cancer cells
Based on the above results, we hypothesized
that CDDO-Me may directly inhibit USP7 in ovarian
cancer cells. To this end, cellular thermal shift assay

manner (Figure 5F). Taken together, these results
confirm that CDDO-Me interacts with USP7 in cells.
Inhibition of USP7 may lead to changes in its
substrates such as MDM2, MDMX, P53 and UHRF1.
To test this hypothesis, HO8910 and SKOV3 cells were
treated with CDDO-Me for different time periods, and
the protein levels of MDM2, MDMX, P53 and UHRF1
were determined by western blotting. As shown in
Figure 6A, CDDO-Me treatment led to decreased levels
of MDM2, MDMX and UHRF1. By contrast, p53 level
markedly increased. Consistent with the idea that CDDOMe inhibits the deubiquitinase activity of USP7, the
amount of ubiquitinated MDM2 markedly increased after
CDDO-Me treatment (Figure 6B). In addition, the halflife of p53 increased from 0.5 h to 1–2 h (Figure 6C, 6D).
Accompanied with the inhibition of USP7, CDDO-Me
treatment led to activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of
PARP1, indicating induction of apoptosis (Figure 6E).
Taken together, these data suggest that CDDO-Me inhibits
USP7 activity in ovarian cancer cells.

and SKOV3 tumor growth (Figure 7A, 7D). Consistent
with previous reports [34], mild weight loss was observed
in the CDDO-Me treatment group (Figure 7B, 7E).
CDDO-Me also decreased the proliferation and increased
the cell death of tumor cells, as assessed by PCNA and
TUNEL staining (Figure 7G, 7H). Moreover, CETSA
assays showed that CDDO-Me treatment increase the
thermal stability of USP7 in tumor tissues, indicating
the interaction of CDDO-Me and USP7 (Figure 7C, 7F).
Furthermore, CDDO-Me increased p53 protein levels
in HO8910 cells but decreased UHRF1 in HO8910 and
SKOV3 cells, indicating the inhibition of USP7 activity
(Figure 7G, 7H). Together, these data indicate that CDDOMe inhibits USP7 activity in tumor tissues.

DISCUSSION
The synthetic oleanane triterpenoid CDDO-Me
is a multifunctional compound that has been studied
in phase I and phase II clinical trials for treating
haematological malignancies and solid tumors. In this
study, we demonstrated that CDDO-Me directly inhibits
USP7 activity in vitro and in vivo. Using CDDO-Me as
a probe, we found that USP7 is overexpressed in ovarian
cancer cells. Targeting USP7 may thus contribute to the
antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities of CDDO-Me.

CDDO-Me inhibits USP7 in vivo
Finally, we investigated the in vivo efficacy of
CDDO-Me in the HO8910 and SKOV3 xenograft model.
Intraperitoneal injection of CDDO-Me inhibited HO8910

Recent studies have reported elevated levels of
USP7 in prostate cancer and gliomas [35–36]. USP7 is
also implicated in modulating tumor growth and apoptosis
in a colon carcinoma xenograft model [37]. Several USP7
inhibitors have shown potent efficacy against tumor cells
[38]. Therefore, USP7 is an attractive drug target for
cancer therapy. In this study, we have shown that USP7
is a direct novel target of CDDO-Me based on following
evidence: (a) the gel-based assay showed that CDDOMe could inhibit USP7 activity in vitro; (b) CETSA and
DARTS analyses demonstrated that CDDO-Me directly
interacts with USP7 in cells; (c) CDDO-Me could compete
with the binding of USP7 to HA-Ub-VS in cells; (d)
consistent with the inhibition of USP7 activity, treatment
with CDDO-Me decreased the levels of USP7 substrates,
such as MDM2, MDMX, and UHRF1.
CDDO-Me has two α, β-unsaturated carbonyl
moieties. The proposed mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of CDDO-Me is the formation of Michael
adducts between CDDO-Me and reactive nucleophiles,
such as free thiols, on target proteins [24]. USP7 is
a cysteine protease. Initially, we hypothesized that
CDDO-Me may covalently bind to the active cysteine
in USP7. However, reduced CDDO-Me also inhibits
the activity of USP7 with similar potency compared to
CDDO-Me. Therefore, CDDO-Me is unlikely to inhibit
USP7 via an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety-dependent
pathway. Our docking studies showed that CDDO-Me
fits well in the ubiquitin-binding pocket. This model may
explain why DTT could abrogate the effect of CDDO-Me.
After reacting with DTT, CDDO-Me may not fit as well
in the same pocket. As expected, the binding of HA-UbVS with USP7 could be abrogated by pre-incubation of
CDDO-Me with USP7 [39]. This result may also provide
explanation for the inhibitory activity of CDDO-Me
against USP2. Currently, several USP7 inhibitors, such
as HBX41,108, HBX19,818 and P5091, are available
[40–41]. Similar to HBX41,108, CDDO-Me is a noncovalent inhibitor of USP7. However, the binding pocket
of CDDO-Me is similar to that of HBX19,818. That is,

CDDO-Me occupies the ubiquitin-binding pocket of
USP7 by interacting with Asp295 and Gln297. Both of
these residues are located at the entrance of the ubiquitinbinding pocket. Therefore, CDDO-Me may represent a
novel non-covalent inhibitor of USP7 by binding to the
C-terminus of ubiquitin.
Although CDDO-Me can inhibit the activity of
USP7 in vitro, an important question is whether CDDO-Me
indeed interacts with USP7 in cells. We used CETSA to
evaluate the interaction between CDDO-Me and USP7.
CETSA is a newly-developed method monitor and
quantify the extent to which a drug candidate reaches and
directly binds to a protein target of interest within a cell.
The CETSA methodology is based on the thermodynamic
stabilization observed for individual proteins as a result
of ligand binding. Compared with other methods that
confirm the interaction of small molecule compounds
with proteins, CETSA is more feasible and can directly
measure whether a drug molecule reaches its targets in
cells [31–32, 42]. Using this method, we demonstrated
that CDDO-Me interacts with USP7 in cells. In addition,
CDDO-Me could protect USP7 from protease-mediated
protein cleavage during DARTS assay. These data indicate
that CDDO-Me could interact with USP7 in its relevant
cellular context. Consistent with the inhibition of USP7
activity in cells, CDDO-Me treatment led to the decrease
of its substrates including MDM2, UHRF1.
CDDO-Me can effectively inhibit the growth of
ovarian cancer cells in vitro [22–23, 27]. Here we found
that CDDO-Me can inhibit USP7 activity. Therefore,
we suspected that USP7 may be a target of CDDOMe in ovarian cancer cells. Interestingly, several tumor
suppressor genes, including p53, PTEN, RB1, BRCA1
and UHRF1 are either mutated or dysregulated in ovarian
cancer. Evidence shows that all of these proteins can be
regulated by USP7. However, the role of USP7 in ovarian
cancer remains unclear. We provide evidence that USP7 is
expressed at higher level in ovarian cancer cell lines and
primary ovarian cancer cells. In contrast, lower level of
USP2 was observed in ovarian cancer cells. Interestingly,
77101

the expression level of USP7 is inversely related to the
degree of differentiation of ovarian cancer cells. Moreover,
knockdown of USP7 significantly inhibits the growth of
H08910 (p53-wild) and SKOV3 (p53-null) cells in vitro
and in vivo, suggesting that USP7 plays an important
role in the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. And the
growth inhibition effect of USP7 knockdown does not rely
on p53. UHRF1, an USP7 substrate, has been observed
in many cancer tissues such as breast, bladder, kidney,
lung, prostate, cervical and pancreatic cancers [43–46]. It
functions as an oncogene in the tumorigenesis and cancer
progression [47–48]. Recently, UHRF1 was found to be a
new oncogenic factor in ovarian cancer as knockdown of
UHRF1 inhibits ovarian cancer cell proliferation [49]. As
CDDO-Me decreases the expression of UHRF1, UHRF1
downregulation may contribute to CDDO-Me-induced cell
growth inhibition.

In conclusion, using CDDO-Me as a probe, we
identified USP7 as a novel target in ovarian cancer.
Targeting USP7 may represent a novel strategy to treat
ovarian cancer. Because CDDO-Me and its related
synthetic triterpenoids have entered clinical trials as
promising preventive and therapeutic agents for cancer
and chronic inflammatory diseases, development of novel
USP7-selective compounds based on the CDDO-Me
scaffold warrant further investigation.

for 10 min at 37°C in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0; 20 mM NaCl; 2 mM DTT). Subsequently, GSTUBA52 (3.92 mM, final concentration) was added. The
mixture was incubated for another 45 min at 37°C. The
reaction was terminated by adding the loading buffer and
boiling on the heat block. The proteins were separated
by 12% sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualised with
Coomassie brilliant blue (G250).

The effect of CDDO-Me on the activity was
evaluated by the cathepsin D activity assay kit
(BioVision Inc.). Briefly, 5 × 106  SKOV3 cells
were collected and lysed in 500 μL lysis buffer for
10  min on ice. After centrifugation (15  000  rpm,
4°C, 10  min), the supernatant was pre-incubated with
50  μM pepstatin A (inhibitor of cathepsin D); DMSO;
and 50 or 100 μM CDDO-Me at 37°C for 30 min. The
substrate GKPILFFRLK (Dnp)-D-R-NH2-labelled with
7-methoxycoumarin-4-ylacetyl (MCA) was added into
the reaction systems, which were incubated for 1.5 h at
37°C. The fluorescence of MCA was determined by the
Synergy H4 Hybrid Microplate Reader with excitation at
328 nm and emission at 460 nm.

Cathepsin B activity assay
The effect of CDDO-Me on the activity was
evaluated by the cathepsin B activity assay kit (BioVision
Inc., Mountain View, CA). Briefly, 5 × 106 SKOV3 cells
were collected and lysed in 500 μL lysis buffer for 10 min
on ice. After centrifugation (15000  rpm, 4°C, 10  min),
the supernatant was pre-incubated with 50 μM E64
(an inhibitor of cathepsin B; Calbiochem); DMSO;
and 50 or 100 μM CDDO-Me, respectively, at 37°C
for 30  min. The substrate RR-AFC was added into the
reaction systems, which were incubated for another 1.5 h
at 37°C. The fluorescence of AFC was determined by the
Synergy H4 Hybrid Microplate Reader with excitation at
400 nm and emission at 505 nm.

Ub-AMC protease assay
Ub-AMC hydrolysis assays were performed at
25°C in the assay buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5;
150 mM NaCl; 2 mM EDTA; 2 mM DTT), which was
supplemented with 1  mg/mL bovine serum albumin
(Roche). The recombinant USP7 (20  nM) was preincubated with DMSO (%) or the respective compounds
(50 μM) for 30 min; the enzymatic reaction was initiated
by adding the Ub-AMC substrate (300 nM). The reaction
mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h before

Synthesis of reduced CDDO-Me

Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with the
lysis buffer (50  mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 100  mM DTT,
2% SDS; 10% glycerol). Cell lysates were centrifuged
at 20,000 × g for 10 min; the proteins in the supernatants
were quantified. Protein extracts were equally loaded on
8%–12% gels for SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The
blots were stained with 0.2% Ponceau S red to ensure
equal protein loading. After blocking with 5% non-fat
milk in PBS, the membranes were probed with antibodies
against Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), HA (Sigma-Aldrich),

pdb) for docking calculation. Water and bromide ions
were all removed. To prepare for both the protein and
small molecule, all hydrogen atoms were added first,
and the Gasteiger charges were computed before the
non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged. The active
site was defined in AutoGrid4 by a grid box as large as
70  ×  70  ×  70 points with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å.
The box was centred on the Tyr514 residue in the crystal
structure of USP7. The protein was considered rigid
for the docking study. The docking parameters were
set as ga_pop_size  =  150 (number of individuals in
population) and ga_run = 100 (number of dockings that
were performed). Default values in the software were set
for other parameters. Protein–ligand interactions were
accounted by the Lamarckian genetic algorithm. Finally,
the conformation was selected according to the predicted
binding free energy.

Cellular thermal shift assay
HO8910 and SKOV3 cells were harvested and
washed with PBS. The cells were diluted in PBS
supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail.
The cell suspensions were freeze-thawed three times with
liquid nitrogen. The soluble fraction (lysate) was separated
from the cell debris by centrifugation at 20,000 × g
for 20  min at 4°C. The cell lysates were diluted with
PBS and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was
treated with DMSO; the other aliquot was mixed with
the diluent of CDDO-Me. After 10–30 min of incubation
at room temperature, the respective lysates were divided
into smaller (50 μL) aliquots and individually heated at
different temperatures for 3  min (Veriti thermal cycler,
Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies), followed by
cooling for 3 min at room temperature. The appropriate
temperatures were determined in preliminary CETSA
experiments (data not shown). The heated lysates were
centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to separate the
soluble fractions from the precipitates. The supernatants
were transferred to fresh microtubes before SDS-PAGE
and Western blot analysis.

Tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry
An ovarian cancer tissue array (US Biomax,
Inc., Rockville, MD) was used for this study; the
array contained ovarian tumors from 68 patients and
10 normal tissue samples. Deparaffinisation and antigen
retrieval were accomplished with the Trilogy solution
(Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA). The heating/pressure was
supplied by a conventional pressure cooker. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was inhibited by 0.3% hydrogen
peroxide. Non-specific interactions were blocked by
normal goat serum. The USP7 antibody (ab26083,
abcam) was diluted in PBS at 1:800 and incubated at
4°C overnight. The bound antibody was detected by
the biotin-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody and
streptavidin-conjugated HRP enzymes in conjunction
with the DAB chromagen. Tissue was counterstained
with haematoxylin. Immunoreactivity was defined by the
presence of discrete brownish chromogen deposits in the
cells. A semi-quantitative scoring method of USP7 was
used for immunohistochemical evaluation; the staining
intensity and percentage positive-stained tumor cells were
recorded. A staining index (with values from 0 to 9) was
obtained from the intensity of USP7 staining multiplied
by the proportion of immunopositive tumor cells. The
staining intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weakly
positive), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong); the proportion of
immunopositive tumor cells was scored as 1 (≤ 10%),
2 (10%–50%) or 3 (> 50%). The expression of USP7 in
the epithelium of all 10 informative samples of normal
ovarian samples was negative (0) or weak (1); thus, the
staining index in the normal ovaries was determined to be
3 or lower. Therefore, we interpreted a staining index of 0
to 3 as the normal expression of USP7, whereas a staining
index of 4 to 9 was interpreted as the overexpression of
this protein. For each sample, the percentage of positive
cells was recorded. The presence of more than 10%
expression of the marker within the tumor cells was
considered positive.

Drug affinity responsive target stability
DARTS is a general methodology for identifying
and studying protein–ligand interaction; this method was
employed to evaluate the CDDO-Me–USP7 interaction.
HO8910 cell pellets were lysed in standard Triton X-100
lysis buffer (50  mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 200  mM NaCl;
0.5% Triton X-100; 10% glycerol; 1 mM DTT), which was
supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma).
The cell lysates were incubated with drugs or vehicle
in room temperature for 50 min. The above mentioned
mixture continued to be digested by pronase (10 mg/mL
stock solutions in water-based aliquots stored at −20°C) at
appropriate ratios dissolved in TNC buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0; 50 mM NaCl; 10 mM CaCl2) for 30 min.
The reaction was stopped by the addition of concentrated
SDS-PAGE loading buffer to a final concentration of 1×,
well mixed and immediately boiled. Finally, the samples
were subjected to Western blot analysis.

Molecular docking
Molecular docking was performed with the
AutoDock4.2 software. The X-ray structure of the
USP7 catalytic domain (PDB ID: 4M5W) was retrieved
