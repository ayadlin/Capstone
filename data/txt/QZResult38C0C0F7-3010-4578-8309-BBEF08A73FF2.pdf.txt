Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive disease characterized
by poor prognosis and vast genetic instability. Recent microarray-based, genome-wide surveys have identified multiple
recurrent copy number aberrations in pancreatic cancer;
however, the target genes are, for the most part, unknown.
Here, we characterized the 19q13 amplicon in pancreatic
cancer to identify putative new drug targets. Copy number
increases at 19q13 were quantitated in 16 pancreatic cancer
cell lines and 31 primary tumors by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Cell line copy number data delineated a 1.1 Mb
amplicon, the presence of which was also validated in 10% of
primary pancreatic tumors. Comprehensive expression analysis by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR
indicated that seven transcripts within this region had
consistently elevated expression levels in the amplified versus
nonamplified cell lines. High-throughput loss-of-function
screen by RNA interference was applied across the amplicon
to identify genes whose down-regulation affected cell viability.
This screen revealed five genes whose down-regulation led to
significantly decreased cell viability in the amplified PANC-1
cells but not in the nonamplified MiaPaca-2 cells, suggesting
the presence of multiple biologically interesting genes in this
region. Of these, the transcriptional regulator intersex-like
(IXL) was consistently overexpressed in amplified cells and
had the most dramatic effect on cell viability. IXL silencing
also resulted in G0-G1 cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis
in PANC-1 cells. These findings implicate IXL as a novel
amplification target gene in pancreatic cancer and suggest
that IXL is required for cancer cell survival in 19q13-amplified
tumors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):1943–9]

Introduction
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a highly aggressive malignancy
with extremely poor prognosis. In the United States, pancreatic
cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death, accounting for
f30,000 deaths per year (1). Pancreatic cancer is characterized
by rapid progression, invasiveness, and profound resistance to
treatment (2). Apart from surgery, there is practically no effective
therapy; typically, the disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage
when surgical resection is no longer possible. Consequently, the

5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is <5% and the median
survival is <6 months (2, 3). Even for patients who undergo
potentially curative resection, the 5-year survival rate is only
f20% (2).
Aneuploidy and increased genetic instability manifesting as
complex genetic aberrations, such as losses, gains, and amplifications, are common features of pancreatic cancer (4, 5). These
genetic alterations are likely to conceal genes involved in disease
pathogenesis, and uncovering such genes might thus provide
targets for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic
tools. In particular, gene amplification is a common mechanism for
activating oncogenes, and other growth-promoting genes in cancer
and amplification of target genes, such as ERBB2 in breast cancer
and MYCN in neuroblastomas, have been shown to have clinical
significance as diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as
therapeutic targets (6). We recently did a microarray-based copy
number analysis in pancreatic cancer cell lines and identified an
f2.9 Mb amplicon at 19q13 (7). This result has since been
confirmed in multiple subsequent studies (8–12) and the same
amplicon has also been observed in other tumor types, including
ovarian, breast, cervical, gastric, and small-cell lung cancer (13–20).
Unfortunately, the microarray used in our previous study did not
provide a complete coverage of the 19q13 region and thus did not
allow direct elucidation of putative target genes. Here, we present
results from the comprehensive evaluation of the 19q13 amplicon
in pancreatic cancer, including detailed copy number and
expression analyses as well as high-throughput loss-of-function
screen using the RNA interference (RNAi) technology.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and tissue samples. Thirteen pancreatic cancer cell lines,
AsPC-1, BxPC-3, Capan-1, Capan-2, CFPAC-1, HPAC, HPAF-II, Hs 700T, Hs
766T, MiaPaCa-2, PANC-1, SU.86.86, and SW1990, were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Three additional cell
lines, DAN-G, HUP-T3, and HUP-T4, were acquired from the German
Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Brunswick, Germany). The
cell lines were cultured under recommended conditions. Commercially
available pancreatic cancer tissue microarray (AccuMaxTM Arrays) was
obtained from Petagen Incorporation (Seoul, Korea). The tissue microarray
contained four nonneoplastic pancreatic tissue specimens and 33
pancreatic cancer cases. Detailed clinicopathologic information on the
tumor specimens is shown in Supplementary Table S1.
Genomic clones. Public genome databases (National Center for
Biotechnology Information3 and University of California Santa Cruz
Genome Bioinformatics4) were used to select 15 bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) clones evenly distributed over the 2.9 Mb amplicon
at 19q13. These BAC clones were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

In addition, a BAC clone (RP11-345J21, a kind gift from Mariano Rocchi,
University of Bari, Bari, Italy) adjacent to the chromosome 19 centromere
on 19q was used as a control. The list of all BAC clones is shown in
Supplementary Table S2.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization. BAC clone DNA was labeled with
SpectrumOrange-dUTP (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL) using random priming.
Chromosome 19 reference probe (RP11-345J21) was labeled with fluorescein-12-dUTP (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA). Dual-color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to pancreatic cancer cell lines was done
as described (21). Hybridization signals were evaluated using Olympus BX50
fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Forty intact nuclei were
scored for each probe, and relative copy numbers were calculated as ratios
of mean absolute copy number of the test probe versus reference probe.
FISH on tissue microarray was carried out as described (22). Three adjacent,
partly overlapping BAC clones (RP11-67A5, RP11-256O9, and CTC-488F21)
were combined to increase signal intensity and hybridization efficiency.
Control experiments on normal lymphocytes verified that this probe
combination gave a single hybridization signal. The RP11-345J21 probe was
again used as a reference. Hybridization signals were scored and evaluated
as described above.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Gene expression
analyses were done using either the Light Cycler equipment (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) or the ABI 7900HT Fast Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Total RNA was isolated from cell lines
using RNeasy Mini total RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and
reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA using Superscript III reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers or iScript cDNA synthesis
kit (Bio-Rad, Inc., Hercules, CA). Normal human pancreatic RNA was
obtained from Ambion (Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom). For the Light
Cycler analyses, primers and probe sets were obtained from TIB MolBiol
(Berlin, Germany), and Light Cycler software (Roche) was used for data
analysis as described (23). Expression levels of the target genes were
normalized against a housekeeping gene TBP (TATA box binding protein;
ref. 23). For the ABI system, TaqMan Gene Expression Assays were obtained
from Applied Biosystems and ABI 7900HT software (Applied Biosystems)
was used for data analyses. Expression levels of the target genes were
normalized against an endogenous reference gene GAPDH (glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Primer and probe sequences are shown in
Supplementary Table S3.
Loss-of-function RNAi screen. Loss of function screening was done by
high-throughput RNAi using a focused small interfering RNA (siRNA) library
targeting all 19 known genes within the amplicon that were expressed in
PANC-1 cells (Supplementary Table S4). Two genes, SAMD4B and EID2B,
were hypothetical proteins at the time of the experiment and were thus not
included. Four siRNAs were designed for each gene using previously
described criteria (24, 25) and were obtained from Qiagen. A nonsilencing
siRNA (Qiagen) was used as a negative control. High-throughput RNAi was
done using siRNA reverse transfection of cells. Briefly, siRNAs were printed
in quadruplicate wells of a 384-well Costar microtiter plate (Fisher
Scientific, Hampton, NH). Diluted Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was added
to the wells to allow for the complexing of siRNA and transfection reagent.
After a 30-min incubation period, cell suspensions of either MiaPaca-2 or
PANC-1 cells were added to give a final concentration of 1,000 per well. Cells
were grown at 37jC with 5% CO2 for 96 h. Total cell number was analyzed
using Cell Titer Blue (Promega, Madison WI), and the plate was read at
excitation 544 nm/emission 560 nm using a EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA). Reduced cell viability to 50% or less compared with
nonsilencing siRNA-treated cells was considered a significant change.
Cell cycle and apoptosis analyses. Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen)
was used to transfect siRNAs in a final concentration of 100 nmol/L into
PANC-1 cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol. IXL 144 siRNA was
used to determine the effect of inhibition of IXL expression; luciferase
control siRNA, which targets the firefly luciferase gene (Genbank accession
no. M15077), was used as a control (Supplementary Table S4). Experiments
were done in triplicates using 24-well plates. After a 48-h transfection, cells
were collected for cell cycle and apoptosis analyses as well as for parallel
mRNA expression analyses (see above) to verify that efficient silencing was

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

obtained. For the cell cycle analysis, trypsinized cells were centrifuged and
suspended to 500 AL hypotonic staining buffer (0.1 mg/mL sodium citrate
tribasic dehydrate, 0.03% Triton X-100, 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide,
2 Ag/mL RNase A) and the amount of propidium iodide incorporated was
determined using flow cytometry (Coulter EPICS XL-MCL, Beckman
Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using
the Cylchred program.5 Annexin V FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit
(Calbiochem) was used to detect apoptotic cells by flow cytometry
(Beckman Coulter, San Diego, CA).

Results
We first did a systematic characterization of the extent of the
19q13 amplicon in a panel of 16 pancreatic cancer cell lines. To this
end, FISH, using 15 BAC clones evenly distributed across the
2.9 Mb region (Supplementary Table S1), was applied. Greater than
2-fold copy number increases were observed in 3 of 16 (19%) cell
lines, PANC-1, Su.86.86, and HPAC (Fig. 1). The PANC-1 cell line
harbored massive amplification (up to 20-fold) that on metaphase
chromosomes manifested as homogeneously staining region–like
structures (Fig. 1E), whereas lower-level copy number increases
(up to 5.3- and 2.6-fold, respectively) were observed in SU.86.86 and
HPAC cells (Fig. 2). The relative copy numbers of PANC-1 cells
varied considerably across the 2.9 Mb region (Fig. 1A–D), whereas
SU.86.86 and HPAC cells showed essentially uniform copy number
levels across the entire amplicon. Based on the PANC-1 copy
number profile, we were able to delineate a 1.1 Mb amplicon core
defined by six partly overlapping BAC clones from RP11-67A5 to
CTC-425O23 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, three BAC clones within this 1.1
Mb amplicon core, RP11-67A5, RP11-256O9, and CTC-488F21,
displayed 14- to 20-fold copy number increase in PANC-1 cells
(Fig. 2), thus defining an 660 kb subregion of extremely high level
amplification.
We also examined the presence of this amplicon in primary
tumors using FISH to a tissue microarray containing 33 pancreatic
cancer specimens. High-level amplification (relative copy number
z5) was observed in 3 of 31 tumors (9.7%) with successful
hybridizations (Fig. 3). All three tumors with amplification were
moderately to poorly differentiated (grades 2–3) ductal adenocarcinomas and showed lymph node metastases (Supplementary
Table S2). Two of the tumor samples also had extensions to
peripancreatic soft tissue with perineural invasion. The metastasis
status of the third tumor was not available.
To explore the consequences of amplification on gene expression, we first used public genome databases6 to retrieve all
transcribed sequences within the core 1.1 Mb amplicon. A total of
39 transcripts, including 27 known genes and 12 hypothetical or
predicted proteins, were identified (Table 1). Sixteen of these were
excluded as possible candidate genes because they represented (a)
obvious pseudogenes, (b) predicted transcripts with no mRNA
and expressed sequence tag evidence in public databases, or (c)
transcripts with no or very low level expression in PANC-1
(Table 1). The last criterion was based on the expectation that any
putative amplification target gene should be highly expressed in
PANC-1 cells that show high-level amplification. The expression
levels of the remaining 23 transcripts were then assessed in all 16
pancreatic cancer cell lines using quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
Interestingly, 22 of the 23 genes were highly overexpressed in

PANC-1 cells compared with the other pancreatic cancer cell lines
(Fig. 4) and normal pancreas (data not shown). Only PLD3, located
at the distal-most end of the amplicon, was not overexpressed in
PANC-1. In contrast, HPAC and Su.86.86 cells showed variable
expression levels from one gene to another (Fig. 4) thus allowing us
to distinguish genes differentially expressed between amplified and
nonamplified cell lines. Six known genes (GMFG, SAMD4B, IXL,
SUPT5H, PSMC4, and MAP3K10) and one hypothetical protein
(LOC284323) showed consistent overexpression in all three
amplified cell lines (Fig. 4). Of these, IXL showed the most distinct
differential expression pattern between the amplified and nonamplified cell line groups, with high-level expression occurring
almost exclusively in the amplified cell lines. In contrast,
GMFG and MAP3K10 were also highly expressed in additional cell
lines with no copy number increase, indicating other activating
mechanisms besides amplification. Interestingly, three of the
overexpressed genes, PSMC4, MAP3K10, and LOC284323, are
located outside the 660 kb amplicon maximum, thus making them
less likely to be the main targets of the amplification.
To identify which of the amplified targets are functionally
important, we did a targeted high-throughput RNAi screen across
the defined 1.1 Mb amplicon. This loss-of-function survey was
applied to study the effect of silencing of 19 known genes from the
amplified region. Four different siRNAs were designed for each
gene (Supplementary Table S4), and their effect on cell viability was
examined in PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells 96 h after transfection.
Down-regulation of IXL resulted in statistically highly significant
reduction in cell viability (P < 0.001) in the amplified PANC-1 cells
but not in the nonamplified MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S5). This effect was observed with two independent
siRNAs in three repeated experiments. Similar reduction in cell

viability was detected after LRFN1 and PLEKHG2 silencing as well
but only with a single siRNA. Finally, down-regulation of GMFG and
SUPT5H also led to reduction in cell viability but to a lesser extent
(Fig. 5A). Other genes examined did not have a statistically
significant effect on cell viability.
Further functional characterization concentrated on IXL because it was located within the 660 kb amplicon maximum and was
implicated in both the expression survey and the RNAi viability

screen. To explore the functional role of IXL overexpression, we
transfected siRNAs targeting IXL into amplified PANC-1 cells and
assessed the effects on cell cycle and apoptosis 48 h after
transfection. A parallel mRNA expression analysis was done to
verify that sufficient silencing was obtained (Fig. 5B). All
functional experiments were done in triplicates and repeated
twice. Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry showed an
increased fraction of G0-G1 phase cells after IXL siRNA (66%)
transfection compared with nontransfected cells (37%) or cells
transfected with a control siRNA (39%; Fig. 5C). Also, the
percentage of apoptotic cells was increased in IXL siRNA–treated
cells (8%) compared with control siRNA (1.6%) or untreated cells
(2.5%; Fig. 5D). Similar phenotypic changes were not observed
after IXL siRNA transfection to nonamplified MiaPaCa-2 cells
(data not shown).

Discussion
Gross chromosomal aberrations, including losses, gains, and
amplifications, are frequent in pancreatic cancer (3). Gene
amplification is a common mechanism for solid tumors to upregulate the expression of genes involved in tumor progression
(26, 27). Although multiple amplified regions have been documented in pancreatic carcinoma, the putative target genes
activated by these aberrations are largely unknown. Identification
of novel amplification target genes is extremely important because
it will not only advance our knowledge on pancreatic cancer
pathogenesis but it might also provide new tools for the clinical
management of this highly aggressive disease.
Previously, we did a genome-wide cDNA microarray-based copy
number analysis to identify localized DNA amplifications in
pancreatic cancer and recognized a novel amplified region at
19q13 spanning 2.9 Mb (7). However, due to incomplete clone
coverage on the microarray used, this previous study did not
permit exact definition of the amplicon boundaries or direct
identification of possible amplification target genes. Therefore,
we now carried out a systematic evaluation of this amplified region
to achieve these objectives. Three cell lines, PANC-1, SU86.86, and
HPAC, harbored the 19q13 amplification, with PANC-1 cells
demonstrating a massive, up to 20-fold, amplification. In addition,
the copy number profile of PANC-1 allowed us to narrow down the
amplicon core to 1.1 Mb, which also contained a 660 kb subregion
of extremely high level amplification. Previous studies have
indicated that amplification target genes are likely to be located
at or near the center of the amplification maximum; that is, the
region with highest copy number increase (28, 29). We thus believe

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

this 660 kb subregion to be of particular interest in pinpointing the
actual target genes of this amplicon.
Because the delineation of the amplicon core was accomplished
using established pancreatic cancer cell lines, we next sought to
validate the presence of the 19q13 amplicon in primary pancreatic
tumors. Evaluation of a set of 31 pancreatic tumors revealed
amplification in a f10% of the cases, thus confirming that this
aberration is also present in actual human tumors and is not a cell
culture–derived artifact. In general, oncogene amplification has
been shown to be linked to advanced disease (30, 31), and, in
ovarian carcinoma, 19q13 amplification has been associated with
less differentiated and more aggressive tumors (14). In our series,
all three tumors with amplification were moderately to poorly
differentiated. All three patients had nodal metastases and two of
them also had local metastases, whereas this information was
missing from the third patient. Based on these tumor characteristics, the 19q13 amplification seems to be associated with
advanced disease in pancreatic cancer as well. However, the
number of analyzed tumors was limited; therefore, the amplification frequency as well as the possible clinicopathologic associations need to be confirmed.
A comprehensive expression analysis was subsequently done
across the 1.1 Mb region to identify genes whose expression levels
are elevated through 19q13 amplification. This approach was based
on the well-established concept that amplification leads to
increased expression of the putative target gene. Our data revealed
a very distinct expression profile in PANC-1 cells demonstrating
high-level expression of all but one gene throughout the entire
amplicon. We hypothesize that the extremely high-level amplification in PANC-1 cells leads to complete deregulation of transcriptional control across the amplicon and thereby increased
expression of all genes within this region. In contrast, SU.86.86
and HPAC cells displayed more variable expression patterns with
consistent overexpression in a subset of seven genes compared
with nonamplified cells, with IXL having the strongest association
with amplification. Four of these seven genes, GMFG, SAMD4B, IXL,
and SUPT5H, are located within the 660 kb amplicon maximum
and were therefore considered the most likely targets.
Because the expression analysis did not explicitly pinpoint a
single putative amplification target gene, we chose to perform a
targeted high-throughput RNAi screen across the entire amplicon
to identify functionally relevant genes. Combination of data
from the expression analysis and the RNAi screen allowed us to
rapidly and systematically identify genes whose expression levels
were elevated through amplification, and, at the same time, whose
down-regulation resulted in phenotypic changes. This strategy
highlighted IXL as a gene that is activated by the 19q13
amplification and whose down-regulation resulted in most
dramatic reduction in cell viability in amplified PANC-1 but not
in nonamplified MiaPaCa-2 cells. LRFN1 and PLEKH2G knockdowns also affected cell viability but not as consistently as IXL.
However, these genes were not systematically overexpressed in all
amplified cell lines. Down-regulation of SUPT5H and GMFG also
depressed cell viability; however, the decrease was not as
significant as for IXL. Based on these data, IXL seems to be the
strongest candidate for the amplification target gene; however, we
cannot exclude the involvement of some of the other genes in the
region.
Further functional assays showed that IXL silencing resulted in
increased apoptosis and G0-G1 arrest again in PANC-1 cells but not
in MiaPaCa-2 cells, suggesting that IXL affects cell cycle regulatory

mechanisms that control the G1-S transition as well as induction of
apoptosis. These data implicate that IXL is required for cell cycle
progression and cell survival in 19q13-amplified pancreatic cancer
cells. IXL is a homologue to Drosophila melanogaster intersex, a
transcriptional regulator involved in female somatic sex determination (32). The protein is broadly conserved during evolution (33),
suggesting its importance in transcriptional regulation also in
other species. Indeed, mammalian IXL has been recognized as a
subunit of Mediator, a multiprotein complex that transduces
regulatory signals from DNA-binding transcription factors to RNA
polymerase II and thereby regulates mRNA synthesis (33, 34). The
Mediator complex is required for transcriptional activation and
thus controls key cellular processes. The exact function of human
IXL remains elusive, although it was recently proposed to be
involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway

(33). The overexpression of IXL in pancreatic cancer may thus lead
to inappropriate activation of several critical cellular processes,
such as those regulating cell growth.
The AKT2 gene has previously been suggested as the target for
the 19q13 amplification (15). AKT2 is the human homologue of the
viral v-akt oncogene, which is responsible for leukemia in mice (19).
Amplification of AKT2 was originally discovered in ovarian cancer
(15) but has been later observed also in other cancer types (14). Our
data show that AKT2 is indeed amplified in pancreatic cancer,
although it is located at the distal-most end of the 19q13 amplicon.
However, AKT2 was not consistently overexpressed in all amplified
cell lines and its down-regulation did not affect cell viability. These
findings indicate that AKT2 is clearly not the main target of the
19q13 amplification in pancreatic cancer although it cannot be
ruled out that simultaneous activation of AKT2 with other

Figure 4. Schematic representation of
mRNA expression levels of 23 genes
within the 1.1 Mb amplicon at 19q13 in
16 pancreatic cancer cell lines. The
expression levels were determined using
quantitative real-time RT-PCR and were
normalized against a housekeeping gene
TBP . The relative expression levels for
each gene were median centered and
displayed as a pseudocolor gradient. The
genes are arranged according to their
chromosomal position (from centromere to
telomere). Bottom, key to the color coding.

candidate genes from this region might provide a growth
advantage for the cancer cells. Recently, two other genes from this
region, PAF1 and DYRK1B, were proposed to associate with
pancreatic cancer development and cell survival, respectively
(35, 36). Yet, again, our data do not show evidence that these
genes would be the key targets of 19q13 amplicon.
In summary, our detailed characterization of the 19q13 amplicon
in pancreatic cancer cell lines delineated a minimal region of
amplification to a 1.1 Mb segment and further pinpointed a 660-kb
amplification maximum. This amplicon was recognized in 19% of

cell lines and 10% of primary pancreatic tumors. Expression
profiling of genes residing in the amplicon revealed seven
biologically interesting genes that were more strongly expressed
in the amplified cell lines compared with the nonamplified ones.
High-throughput loss-of-function screen by RNAi technology
showed that down-regulation of IXL, and, to a lesser extent,
GMFG and SUPT5H, resulted in decreased cell viability in the
amplified PANC-1 but not in the nonamplified cells. Additionally,
IXL knockdown was found to associate with G0-G1 arrest and
increased apoptosis. Our results reveal IXL as a novel amplification

IXL, a Cell Survival Regulator in Pancreatic Cancer

target gene that is essential for the growth and survival of a subset
of pancreatic carcinomas with 19q13 amplification. Thereby, IXL
has a critical role in pancreatic cancer development and growth
regulation and represents an ideal therapeutic target. However, it is
possible that other genes in this region might also contribute to
pancreatic cancer pathogenesis. Finally, this study shows that the
combination of copy number and expression analysis together with
targeted RNAi screen provides an efficient method for rapid
identification of putative amplification target genes in cancer.
