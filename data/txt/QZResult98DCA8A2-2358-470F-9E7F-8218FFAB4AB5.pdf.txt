Abstract
Intestinal radiation injury is dose limiting during abdominal
and pelvic radiotherapy and critical for the outcome after
accidental whole-body radiation exposure. The multifunctional
cytokine, interleukin-11 (IL-11), ameliorates the intestinal
radiation response, but its clinical use is hampered by severe
toxicity after systemic administration. This study addressed
whether protection against intestinal radiation injury can be
achieved by intraluminal administration of IL-11. Male rats
underwent surgical transposition of a 4-cm small bowel loop
to the scrotum. For repeated intraluminal drug administration, an ileostomy, proximal to the bowel loop in the scrotum,
was created. The transposed intestinal loop was exposed to
5 Gy fractions on 9 consecutive days. Recombinant human
IL-11 (rhIL-11; 2 mg/kg/d) or vehicle was given through the
ileostomy from 2 days before until 2 weeks after irradiation.
At 2 weeks, structural, cellular, and molecular aspects of
intestinal radiation injury were assessed. rhIL-11 ameliorated
structural manifestations of radiation enteropathy, including
radiation injury score (6.5 F 0.6 in the vehicle group versus
4.0 F 0.3 in the IL-11 group; P = 0.001), mucosal surface area
loss (0.2 F 0.1 versus 0.5 F 0.03; P < 0.0001), and intestinal
wall thickening (842 F 66 Mm versus 643 F 54 Mm; P = 0.02),
reduced postradiation transforming growth factor-B overexpression, and reduced numbers of ED2-positive cells.
Postirradiation mucosal mast cell numbers were partially
restored by rhIL-11. These data show that local administration
of rhIL-11 ameliorates early intestinal radiation injury and
support further development of rhIL-11 to reduce manifestations of intestinal radiation injury in the clinic. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Radiation therapy is used in 70% of cancer patients and is a
critical factor in 25% of cancer cures. Advances in treatment
planning and radiation delivery techniques have improved the
ability to focus the radiation beam to the target volume.
Nevertheless, radiation therapy remains dose limited by the
tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. The intestine not only is
a major dose-limiting organ during abdominal, pelvic, and
retroperitoneal radiation therapy (1, 2) but is also one of the

critical organs for the outcome of accidental whole-body radiation
exposure. Therefore, interventions that reduce intestinal radiation
injury (radiation enteropathy) are urgently needed.
Radiation enteropathy is not only the result of radiation-induced
intestinal crypt cell death but rather results from a complex
interplay of pathophysiologic processes. Inflammatory processes
contribute substantially to the pathophysiology of radiation
enteropathy (3, 4). During radiation therapy of organized tissues,
such as the intestine, acute inflammatory responses occur after
each radiation fraction. Many of these inflammatory responses are
not resolved within 24 h, thus leading to an accumulation of
responses with each radiation fraction that follows. Consequently,
the inflammatory response that occurs after a course of
fractionated radiation is not adequately resolved, as after physical
trauma, but leads to chronic overproduction of proinflammatory
cytokines (5, 6). Hence, modifiers of inflammation and/or immune
responses may be effective radiation response modifiers in
organized tissues (7, 8).
Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine
that also has hematopoietic growth factor activity and cytoprotective effects on intestinal crypt cells (9, 10). Recombinant
human IL-11 (rhIL-11) is used to reduce thrombocytopenia in
patients treated with chemotherapy (11) and has been tested in
clinical studies for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (12).
Systemic administration of rhIL-11 improves crypt cell survival
and reduces intestinal mucosal injury after total body irradiation
in mice (13–15). However, although systemic administration of
rhIL-11 is well tolerated in rodent models, severe side effects in
human subjects, including significant fluid retention and
multisystem organ failure, have limited the implementation of
systemic IL-11 in the clinic (16, 17). In an attempt to derive
therapeutic benefit from the gastrointestinal protection conferred by rhIL-11, while avoiding systemic side effects, entericcoated oral formulations have been developed for intraluminal
delivery of this cytokine (18). Indeed, studies in human subjects
have confirmed that administration of high oral doses of entericcoated rhIL-11 result in undetectable systemic levels and no
clinical signs of systemic toxicity (18).
Despite the well-documented safety and feasibility of intraluminal administration of rhIL-11, the therapeutic efficacy of this
approach for the purpose of ameliorating intestinal radiation injury
has not been investigated. Direct intraluminal injection of radiation
response modifiers during surgical exteriorization of the bowel has
been used in other animal models of radiation enteropathy (19). We
recently developed a rat model that allows daily intraluminal
administration of response modifiers during and after a course of
fractionated irradiation without the need for additional surgery. In
this study, we tested whether delivery of rhIL-11 into the gut lumen
during localized, fractionated irradiation ameliorates radiation
enteropathy development.

Materials and Methods
Surgery. A total of 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan), weighing 170
to 195 g on day of arrival, was housed under standardized conditions with
controlled temperature and humidity (30–35%) and a 12-12 h light-dark
cycle. The rats had free access to standard rat chow (TD8640, Harlan
Teklad) and tap water. All animals were conditioned to this environment
for 7 days before surgery. The experimental protocol was approved by the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. The UAMS animal care facility is fully accredited
by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.
A model for localized small bowel irradiation in combination with
local delivery of drugs to the bowel lumen was used as described in detail
before (Fig. 1; ref. 8). In brief, rats were anesthetized with i.m. injections of
60 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride and 10 mg/kg xylazine and orchiectomized, and a loop of distal ileum, located 10 cm from the ileocecal valve,
was sutured to the inside of the scrotum. The resulting ‘‘scrotal hernia’’
contained a 4-cm loop of small intestine that was accessible for localized
irradiation without additional manipulation.
Subsequently, an anteperistaltic Bishop-Koop type ileostomy was created
by making a circular 4-mm skin incision in the left lower quadrant of
the abdominal wall. The intestine was divided 12 to 15 cm proximal to the
scrotal loop, and the distal limb was pulled through the skin incision and
matured to the skin with six to eight full-thickness interrupted 6-0
polypropylene sutures. Intestinal continuity was reestablished by an end-toside anastomosis between the proximal limb and the distal limb, 6 to 7 cm
from the ileostomy. The abdominal incision was closed in two layers
(muscle/aponeurosis and skin). After surgery, the animals were maintained
in an incubator with controlled temperature until completely awake. During
the first postoperative week, patency of the ileostomy was ensured by daily
perfusion with a small volume of normal saline using an olive-tipped gavage
needle followed by application of triple antibiotic ointment to lubricate
the stoma at the skin surface. Subsequently, the ileostomies were perfused
weekly with saline until the start of drug administration.
Irradiation protocol. Irradiation was done after 6 weeks of postoperative recovery using a Seifert Isovolt 320 X-ray machine (Seifert X-Ray
Corp.). Irradiation characteristics were as follows: 250 kV, 15 mA, with 3 mm
aluminum added filtration. The resulting half-value layer was 0.85 mm
copper and the dose rate was 4.49 Gy/min. Calibration and dosimetry have
been described in detail before (20).

delivery of rhIL-11 was combined with a scrotal hernia for localized irradiation of
small intestine. Left, cartoon of the model. X-ray images show that contrast,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane inhalation, placed in a supine
position on a PVC board, and exposed to irradiation of the small bowel
segment in the scrotal hernia. Rats were randomly assigned to receive either
fractionated sham irradiation or fractionated irradiation with 5 Gy daily for
9 consecutive days. This radiation schedule consistently produces moderate
to severe early radiation enteropathy in our model system.
rhIL-11 administration. A daily dose of rhIL-11 (Neumega, Wyeth) or
vehicle was given from 2 days before the start of (sham) irradiation until
2 weeks after the end of (sham) irradiation (a total of 24 intraluminal
injections of rhIL-11). rhIL-11 was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl containing 0.1%
human serum albumin (HSA; Sigma) and given directly into the bowel
lumen through the ileostomy with a metal olive-tipped gavage needle at a
daily bolus of 2 mg/kg body weight (injection volume, 750 AL). Vehicletreated rats were injected with 0.9% NaCl, containing 1.8% HSA (injection
volume, 750 AL), to deliver the same amount of total protein as delivered to
the rhIL-11–treated rats. Special care was taken to avoid backflow of the
drug or vehicle by holding the rats in an upright position for at least 10 s
after injection. The daily drug injection did not require anesthesia.
Radiation enteropathy is classified as early (acute) or delayed (chronic).
This study focused on the early effects of radiation. Rats were euthanized
2 weeks after the last day of (sham) irradiation. Three specimens of
irradiated and unirradiated intestine (f10 cm proximal of the scrotal loop)
were obtained. One specimen was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
transferred to 80jC for RNA extraction, one specimen was fixed in
formalin for histopathology and morphometry, and one specimen was fixed
in methanol-Carnoy’s solution (methanol/chloroform/glacial acetic acid,
6:3:1) for immunohistochemical analysis.
Radiation injury score. H&E-stained sections were used to assign
radiation injury score (RIS), which provides a global measure of the severity
of structural radiation injury. It has been extensively used and validated in
our laboratory (21). Briefly, seven histopathologic variables of radiation
injury (mucosal ulcerations, epithelial atypia, thickening of subserosa,
vascular sclerosis, intestinal wall fibrosis, ileitis cystica profunda, and lymph
congestion) were assessed and graded from 0 to 3. The sum of the scores for
the individual alterations constitutes the RIS. All specimens were evaluated
in a blinded fashion by two separate researchers, and discrepancies in
scores were resolved by consensus.
Intestinal mucosal surface area. Radiation-induced decrease in
mucosal surface area (MSA) is a sensitive variable of small bowel radiation
injury. MSA was measured in vertical H&E-stained sections using a
stereologic projection/cycloid method as described by Baddeley et al. (22)
and adapted by us to our model system (21). This technique does not
require assumptions about the shape or orientation distribution of the
specimens and thus circumvents problems associated with most other
procedures for surface area measurement.
Intestinal wall thickness. Intestinal wall thickening is a measure of
both reactive intestinal wall fibrosis and intestinal smooth muscle cell
hyperplasia. Intestinal wall thickness (encompassing submucosa, muscularis externa, and subserosa) as well as the thickness of the subserosa alone
were measured with computerized image analysis (Image-Pro Plus, Media
Cybernetics) in 10 fields per section (40 objective), three measurements
per field.
Mast cell numbers. Sections were stained with 0.5% toluidine blue in
0.5 N HCl for 7 days followed by a 10 min-incubation in 0.7 N HCl. The
number of mast cells in 10 fields per section (40 objective) was considered
a single value for statistical analysis.
Immunohistochemistry and computerized image analysis. Immunohistochemical staining for ED2, myeloperoxidase, transforming growth
factor-h (TGF-h), and collagen types I and III was done with methods
established and optimized in our laboratory. Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 1% H2O2 in
methanol for 30 min. Nonspecific binding was reduced with 10% normal goat
or 10% normal rabbit serum (Vector Laboratories) in 3% dry powdered milk
in TBS for 1 h. Sections were incubated with mouse anti-ED2 (1:200; Serotec),
rabbit anti-myeloperoxidase (1:200; Dako), pan-specific rabbit anti-TGF-h
(1:300; R&D Systems), goat anti-collagen I (1:100; Southern Biotechnology
Associates), or goat anti-collagen III (1:100; Southern Biotechnology

Local IL-11 Reduces Intestinal Radiation Injury

Associates) for 2 h. This was followed by a 30-min incubation with the
following biotinylated antibodies: goat anti-mouse IgG ( for ED2, 1:400;
Sigma), rabbit anti-goat IgG ( for collagen I and III, 1:400; Vector Laboratories), or goat anti-rabbit IgG ( for TGF-h and myeloperoxidase, 1:400;
Vector Laboratories). Sections were incubated with avidin-biotin-peroxidase
complex for 30 min (Vector Laboratories) and developed in TBS containing
0.5 mg/mL 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.003% H2O2.
Quantitative assessment of immunoreactivity was done using computerized image analysis (Image-Pro Plus) as described and validated before
(23). Areas positive for immunoreactivity of extracellular matrix-associated
TGF-h, collagen I, or collagen III were measured in 20 fields per section
(40 objective). Cells positive for ED2 or myeloperoxidase were identified
by color thresholding. The number of positive cells per 10 fields (40
objective) was considered a single value for statistical analysis.
Statistics. Statistical analysis was done with software packages Number
Cruncher Statistical Systems 2000 (NCSS) and Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences 14.0 (SPSS). Differences in end points were tested with
ANOVA, with radiation and rhIL-11 as fixed factors, and post hoc multiplerange testing as appropriate. Univariate comparisons were done with the
Mann-Whitney test. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Similar to what has been shown in humans, administration of
rhIL-11 by the local route was well tolerated and not associated
with clinical signs of toxicity.
As reported in previous studies, irradiation induced significant
structural alterations in the intestinal wall, resulting in a significant
increase in RIS (P < 0.001), intestinal wall thickness (P < 0.001), and

thickness of the subserosa (P = 0.01) and a significant reduction in
MSA (P < 0.001; Fig. 2).
Local administration of rhIL-11 had no effects on intestinal
structure in sham-irradiated animals. In contrast, in irradiated
animals, rhIL-11 administration was associated with a significant
reduction in RIS (P = 0.001; Fig. 2A). Of all RIS variables, mucosal
ulceration, subserosal thickening, and vascular sclerosis were
reduced most markedly by rhIL-11. Likewise, rhIL-11 significantly
reduced total intestinal wall thickness (P = 0.02; Fig. 2B) and
subserosal thickness (P = 0.02; Fig. 2C) in irradiated intestine.
rhIL-11 also ameliorated radiation-induced loss of MSA (P < 0.0001;
Fig. 2D).
TGF-h is mechanistically involved in both early and delayed
intestinal radiation responses. Radiation induced a small increase
in extracellular matrix–associated TGF-h immunoreactive area
(radiation*IL-11 interaction component: P = 0.01). rhIL-1 significantly reduced TGF-h after irradiation (P = 0.004), bringing it back
to levels similar to unirradiated control intestine (Fig. 3).
The early intestinal radiation response is associated with
accumulation of macrophages and granulocytes. Hence, significant increases in the number of ED2-positive cells (macrophages)
and myeloperoxidase-positive cells (mainly neutrophils) were
observed after irradiation. Large numbers of ED2-positive cells
were especially found in areas with mucosal ulceration.
Treatment with rhIL-11 significantly reduced the number of
ED2-positive cells after irradiation (P = 0.02; Fig. 4A), whereas the
reduction in the number of myeloperoxidase-positive cells did not

at least part of the protective effect on crypt cells is simply the
result of induction of transient cell cycle arrest (31), somewhat
similar to TGF-h, which is assumed to protect intestinal crypt cells
by inhibiting their progression through G1 (32).
Mucosal mast cell numbers are greatly reduced 2 weeks after
small bowel irradiation in rats (8). rhIL-11 treatment was
associated with increased mast cell numbers both in irradiated
and unirradiated intestine. Members of the IL-6 family of cytokines,
including IL-11, can induce mast cell proliferation (33), which
might explain the increased mast cell numbers in the present
study. Because of the protective role of mast cells in the early
intestinal radiation response (34), it is conceivable that the
beneficial effect of rhIL-11 may be, at least partly, because of the
increased number of mast cells.

bowel irradiation in rats (9  5 Gy). Local administration of rhIL-11 significantly

reach statistical significance (P = 0.1; Fig. 4B). The number of
mast cells was significantly reduced at 2 weeks after irradiation
(P < 0.001). Small numbers of mast cells were especially found in
areas with mucosal ulceration. rhIL-11 partially restored mast cell
numbers after irradiation (P = 0.006). Interestingly, rhIL-11
administration also increased mast cell numbers in shamirradiated intestine (Fig. 4C).
At the early time point used in this study, no changes were found
in immunoreactive area for collagen I or collagen III and rhIL-11
did not affect collagen I or collagen III immunoreactivity (data not
shown).

Discussion
This study shows unequivocally that intraluminal delivery of
rhIL-11 significantly ameliorates structural, cellular, and molecular
manifestations of early radiation injury after local fractionated
irradiation of rat small bowel.
rhIL-11 may exert its protective effects in radiation enteropathy
by a variety of mechanisms. First, IL-11 is a potent antiinflammatory cytokine. Reduced numbers of neutrophils and
macrophages after rhIL-11 treatment of irradiated intestine suggest
that IL-11 may indeed interfere with the postradiation intestinal
inflammatory response. rhIL-11 reduces production of many
inflammatory mediators by macrophages, including IL-6, IL-12,
tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-1h, and nitric oxide (24). Analogous to
the findings in our study, rhIL-11 reduced myeloperoxidase activity
and transcript levels of profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines,
including TGF-h, in a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease
(25). The role of TGF-h in radiation injury and radiation-induced
adverse tissue remodeling is well established (26–28). The reduced
postradiation increase in TGF-h in the current study may therefore
contribute to the observed reduction of structural manifestations
of radiation enteropathy.
In vivo crypt cell apoptosis is significantly reduced by rhIL-11 as
early as 1 day after combined radiation and chemotherapy in mice
(29). Moreover, in vitro studies show that rhIL-11 has cytoprotective effects on intestinal epithelial cells, coinciding with an
up-regulation of the IL-11 receptor complex and heat shock protein
25 (10, 30). These studies are consistent with a direct cytoprotective
effect of rhIL-11 on intestinal crypt cells, which could contribute
to reduced mucosal alterations after irradiation. It is possible that

Local IL-11 Reduces Intestinal Radiation Injury

Interactions between the enteric nervous system and intestinal
mast cells are required for maintaining mucosal homeostasis and
for an appropriate response to injury (35). Interestingly, studies in
an inflammatory bowel disease model in rats showed that the
intestinal neural response was improved after rhIL-11 treatment
(36). This observation has interesting parallels to radiation
enteropathy, where sensory nerve ablation has been shown to
greatly exacerbate the early intestinal radiation response (37). It
is tempting to speculate that improved neural responses and
interaction between the enteric nervous system and intestinal
mucosal mast cells may contribute to the protective effects of
rhIL-11 in radiation enteropathy.
S.c. injections of rhIL-11 reduce intestinal radiation injury in
animal models (13–15) and ameliorate inflammatory bowel
disease in humans (12). However, although systemic administration of IL-11 does not cause overt toxicity in rodents, it is
associated with substantial toxicity in humans (16, 17), thus
limiting its use in the clinic. To derive therapeutic benefit from
gastrointestinal effects of rhIL-11, and at the same time prevent
unwanted systemic side effects, enteric-coated oral formulations
that allow intraluminal delivery of this cytokine without systemic
absorption have been developed (18). In human subjects, clinical
studies have verified that administration of high oral doses of
enteric-coated rhIL-11 does not result in detectable levels of this
cytokine in the systemic circulation and does not cause clinical or
biochemical signs of systemic toxicity (18). Because of the
documented clinical safety of intraluminal rhIL-11, the current
preclinical study was designed to investigate the potential benefits
of intraluminal delivery of rhIL-11 on intestinal radiation injury.
Previously, intraluminal administration of radiation response
modifiers has been successful in amelioration of radiation
enteropathy in animal models (19). An advantage of the model
used in the present study is that the administration through a
continent ileostomy allows repeated drug administration for
extended periods. This is particularly useful with clinically
relevant fractionated radiation schedules and also allows injection
during the postradiation period.
Although previous studies have clearly documented the safety of
the intraluminal delivery route of rhIL-11 in humans (18), it is
prudent to consider the possibility that use of this cytokine in the
setting of intestinal radiation mucositis (where the epithelial
barrier is defective) could lead to absorption and some degree of
systemic toxicity. Therefore, the use of rhIL-11 in patients who
undergo radiation therapy should preferably be investigated
according to a carefully planned dose escalation protocol. However
because of the size of the mature protein (177 amino acid residues),

systemic absorption, even when mucosal barrier integrity is lost,
is considered unlikely.
Although local delivery of rhIL-11 to the bowel lumen during
radiation therapy is unlikely to result in increased rhIL-11 levels at
the site of nongastrointestinal tumors, it is prudent to ascertain
that this method of rhIL-11 delivery does not stimulate cancer
growth or reduce the sensitivity of cancer cells to the cancer
treatment in question. Studies of the expression of IL-11 and the
IL-11 receptor in colon cancer have been contradictory (38, 39),
but IL-11 has no direct effect on the growth of colon carcinoma
cell lines in vitro (40). Moreover, whereas s.c. injections with
recombinant IL-11 protects mice from thoracic radiation injury,
the radiosensitivity of pulmonary breast cancer metastases is not
affected (41). Consistent with the presumed absence of a growthpromoting effect on malignant tumors, s.c. injection of rhIL-11
has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a
supportive treatment in adults with solid tumors and lymphomas
with severe chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (11).
Taken together, the results reported here suggest that local
delivery of rhIL-11 to the bowel lumen may be a promising
interventional strategy by which to reduce the risk of radiation
enteropathy in cancer patients. The effects of local rhIL-11
treatment on late intestinal radiation injury remain to be
determined. However, because rhIL-11 likely interferes with the
ongoing inflammatory responses that are induced by irradiation,
and early mucosal injury is greatly reduced as shown here, a
beneficiary effect of local rhIL-11 treatment on late radiation
enteropathy may be inferred.
In conclusion, rhIL-11 ameliorates early intestinal radiation
injury after localized fractionated small bowel irradiation in rats.
Our data may provide a preclinical basis for future clinical studies
to assess local delivery of rhIL-11 as a method to prevent or
ameliorate intestinal injury in patients who undergo radiation
therapy of tumors in the pelvis or abdomen. These results may also
be relevant to the development of medical countermeasures
against intestinal injury after accidental radiation exposure or in
the radiological terrorism setting.
