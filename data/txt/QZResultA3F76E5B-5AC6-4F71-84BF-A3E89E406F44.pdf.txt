ABSTRACT
The combination of erlotinib with gemcitabine is one of the most promising
therapies for advanced pancreatic cancer. Aiming at optimizing this combination, we
analyzed in detail the response to sequential treatments with erlotinib → gemcitabine
and gemcitabine → erlotinib with an 18 h interval, adopting a previously established
experimental/computational approach to quantify the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects
at G1, S and G2M checkpoints. This assessment was achieved by contemporary fits
of flow cytometric and time-lapse experiments in two human pancreatic cancer cell
lines (BxPC-3 and Capan-1) with a mathematical model reproducing the fluxes of cells
through the cycle during and after treatment.
The S-phase checkpoint contributes in the response to erlotinib, suggesting that
the G1 arrest may hamper S-phase cytotoxicity. The response to gemcitabine was
driven by the dynamics of the progressive resumption from the S-phase arrest after
drug washout. The effects induced by single drugs were used to simulate combined
treatments, introducing changes when required. Gemcitabine → erlotinib was more
than additive in both cell lines, strengthening the cytostatic effects on cells recovering
from the arrest induced by gemcitabine. The interval in the erlotinib → gemcitabine
sequence enabled to overcome the antagonist effect of G1 block on gemcitabine efficacy
and improved the outcome in Capan-1 cells.

INTRODUCTION

and erlotinib was also investigated in pancreatic cancer
(reviewed in [5]), where EGFR is over-expressed in
more than 50% of cases [6–8], and gave a significant but
limited improvement in overall survival of approximately
two weeks, so this regimen has not been widely adopted,
in consideration of its added toxicity [2]. However, preclinical studies indicate that the order in which EGFR
inhibitors and gemcitabine are given is important in
determining a synergistic or antagonistic effect of
the combination and simultaneous treatment may be
antagonistic [9–11], suggesting there is room to improve
the effectiveness of the therapy.
We believe that deeper knowledge, not only of
the molecular processes but also of cell proliferation in
response to treatment challenges, is vital to optimize
the treatment schedules. The approach we propose
has already been used to decode the dose- and timeresponses to different anticancer agents [12–20]. It allows
a detailed analysis of the dynamics of cell proliferation,

Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes
of cancer death in the Western world and its lethality
is principally ascribed to the fact that only 15–20% of
patients are eligible for surgery and the best available
therapies increase survival by only a few months [1].
Among cytotoxic drugs, gemcitabine was established as
first-line standard chemotherapy but since its introduction
in the late 1990s there have been no significant
improvements in survival [2]. At present a combination of
5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin or gemcitabine
and nab-paclitaxel are considered standard treatments,
having demonstrated significant improvement in median
survival, global health status, and quality of life [3, 4].
Besides cytotoxic drugs, small molecules targeting
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), such as
erlotinib, have shown clinical activity as monotherapy or
in combination. Simultaneous treatment with gemcitabine

reconstructing in silico the fluxes of the cells in the cycle,
while interacting with the checkpoints in G1, S and G2M
phases, and separating cytostatic from cytotoxic effects.
As the antiproliferative effect of the combination
can depend on the different genetic background of the cells
[21], we selected two human pancreatic cancer cell lines,
BxPC-3 and Capan-1, both p53-mutated (point mutations
A159V in Capan-1 and Y220C in BxPC-3) [22,  23]
but differing in KRAS status (point mutation G12V in
Capan-1 and wild type in BxPC-3) [22, 23] and EGFR
protein expression levels (low in Capan-1 and high in
BxPC-3) [24], and analyzed in detail the antiproliferative
response to erlotinib and gemcitabine in both systems. The
proliferation process was dynamically rendered in silico to
interpret the response to combined treatments, providing
a solid ground and new information for their evaluation.

The anti-proliferative effects of erlotinib were
confined to generations 0 and 1 and the cells were able to
grow normally after two mitoses. Cell death was detected
mainly among undivided cells treated with the highest
concentrations (Supplementary Figure 3).
Figure 1B shows the results of 6 h treatment with
gemcitabine. The main perturbation shown by FC was
an increase of %S and a decrease of %G1 at 24 h in
samples treated with 20 and 40 nM. DNA histograms
(Supplementary Figure 4) indicated that a subpopulation
of partially synchronized cells was propagating in S
phase at that time. With 120 nM there was a lower, later
increase of %S. An additional short-time effect was a
decrease of %G2M, suggesting that cells treated while in
G2M were able to reach G1, whereas entry in G2M was
reduced. The short-time decrease of generation 0 cells
confirmed this (Figure 1B – TL panels). After treatment,
the number of cells in generation 0 remained stable up to
24 h, indicating a strong cytostatic effect even with 20 nM,
then generation 0 cells divided and entered generation 1 at
dose-dependent rates. Only cells treated with 120 nM were
delayed in generation 1 and strong cell death was detected
(Supplementary Figure 5).
The overall process of proliferation involves the
passage of cell cohorts through the cell cycle and mitosis,
while treatment changes the “unperturbed” cycling
imposing delays or blocks and killing cells with different
mechanisms in each phase. The complexity of the effects
of erlotinib or gemcitabine was interpreted by rendering
the complete cycling of the cell population through G1, S
and G2M and in the subsequent generations in silico.

RESULTS
Cell cycle effects of erlotinib and gemcitabine:
experimental data
Before approaching the interpretation of combined
treatments, we studied the complete time- and dosedependence of the anti-proliferative cell cycle response
induced by the single treatments in both cell lines. We
collected flow cytometry (FC) and time-lapse (TL) data
during and after treatment with different concentrations
ranging from low-effective (about 30% growth inhibition)
to high-effective (about 70% growth inhibition) according
to preliminary growth inhibition experiments with
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay.
Experimental data after treatments with erlotinib
or gemcitabine on BxPC-3 are reported in Figure 1.
Cell cycle distribution was only slightly altered by
1  mM erlotinib, with an increase of %G1 at the end of
treatment (48 h) and a decrease at 72 h. The accumulation
of cells in G1 was accentuated with 10 and 40 mM and
already detectable at 24 h (Figure 1A–FC panels and
Supplementary Figure 2). At 72 h cells were out of G1 and
at 96 h the cell cycle was still altered only with 40 mM.
TL showed up the generation-dependence of the
effects of erlotinib (Figure 1A – TL panels). In the first 6 h
the curves representing the cells in generation 0 decreased
similarly in control and treated samples, indicating that the
cells that were in G2M at the beginning of the treatment
could divide like the control. Afterwards the exit of the
cells from generation 0 was dose-dependently delayed,
and more than 20% were still undivided at 96 h in the
samples treated with 40 mM erlotinib. In cells that were
able to divide, cell cycle progression in generation 1 was
again dose-dependently delayed, as demonstrated by
their long stay in generation 1, their late appearance in
generation 2 (after 48 h) in 10- and 40-mM treated samples
(Figure 1A–TL panels), and the longer average cell cycle
duration (Tc) (Supplementary Figure 3).

Cell cycle effects of erlotinib and gemcitabine:
simulation results
Core of the model are continuity equations which
govern the dynamic evolution of the number of cells in
each age and phase (see Supplementary Methods). The
inputs of the model are parameters that describe the cell
cycle during unperturbed growth (mean phase durations
– G1, S and G2M – with their variability, expressed as
coefficients of variation – CVG1, CVS and CVG2M) and
the effects of treatment, altering the normal cell cycle
flow. Each drug-induced effect is associated to a single
parameter expressing its probability of occurrence. They
include “delay” and “block” (cytostatic effects) and “death
rates” (cytotoxic effects) in each cell cycle phase and
generation. For instance, “block” is modeled assuming
that when a cohort of coetaneous cells arrives at a given
checkpoint the fraction of cells corresponding to the block
probability is arrested, and the others go on and reach the
next phase. In this way we can account for the fact that not
all cells are arrested and we can “measure” the activity of
the checkpoint – strong if the block probability is high,
weak if it is low. Blocked cells may subsequently re-enter
the cycle according to a “re-cycling rate”.

The researcher can build the model and simulate the
proliferation at the desired level of complexity obtaining
as output the time course of measurable quantities
comparable with experimental data, like cell number and
cell cycle percentages. Once the model of normal cycling
of untreated cells was established by fitting control data,
the model of treatments is obtained by optimizing the
parameters of the perturbation modules in play.
The best-fit models of erlotinb and gemcitabine
are represented in Figure 1, with the experimental data,
showing that they closely predicted all FC and TL data
with their time- and dose-dependence.

supposed to prevalently affect G1 cells, we first attempted
to fit FC and TL data with models including cell cycle
perturbations only in G1 phase, but they were not able to
provide reasonable fits, making predictions conflicting
with either TL or FC data (not shown). To conciliate the
delays observed in TL data with the time variations of cell
cycle percentages obtained by FC, we needed to associate
the G1 arrest with a delay in S phase and a mild G2M
arrest.
Figure 2 shows the dose-dependence of the main
parameters of the erlotinib model, obtained fitting jointly
the FC and TL time courses shown in Figure 1. Cellular
response to erlotinib involved checkpoints in all phases,
but they were not immediately activated. Data were
fitted adopting a sigmoid time-dependence for generation
0 parameters describing delay and blocking activities, with
half-maximum at 6 h. The dose-dependence was striking:
G1 block appeared at 10 mM and was almost complete at

Erlotinib
In order to simulate the effects induced by erlotinib
we considered the two intervals 0–48 h (with the drug) and
48–96 h (after drug washout) separately. As erlotinib is

40 mM, S-phase delay was already strong (0.6 probability)
with 1 mM, reached 0.9 with 10 mM and was almost
complete at 40 mM, while a weak G2M block was
detected at 10 mM and reached 0.5 probability at 40 mM
(Figure 2A–generation 0). The delayed activation and the
weakness of G2M checkpoint allowed cell divisions in the
first hours of treatment, but newborn cells (generation 1)
were then intercepted at G1 checkpoint and almost all of
them were arrested when exposed to 10 mM or higher
concentrations (Figure 2A–generation 1).
Cell death occurred in S (not in G1) phase in
generation 0 with dose-dependent rate, but remaining low
up to 10 mM.
After discontinuation of treatment (48 h), only
the cells that had already reached generation 2 at 48 h
continued to cycle without delays. Cells in generations
0 and 1 were no longer intercepted by G1 checkpoint and
those previously blocked gradually re-entered the cycle
(Figure 2B–G1 recycling rate), but progression through
S and G2M phases was delayed (Figure 2B–delay/block
probability). A high fraction of 40-mM treated cells was
still in generation 0 after treatment and experienced a
strong G2M delay, but cell death was not detected even
with this high concentration.

(120 nM) (Figure 3A). Only cells treated with 120 nM
were still delayed in G1 after mitosis (generation 1). The
mild perturbation of G2M phase did not involve cells that
were in G2M during treatment, but only those in generation
0 that reached G2M later than 12 h and when the DNA
synthesis inhibition was released.

Effects on Capan-1 cells
The DNA distribution of Capan-1 cells during and
after treatment with erlotinib and gemcitabine is shown in
Figure 4A. The patterns of the response to treatments in
Capan-1 were similar to those in BxPC-3, even though
in Capan-1 higher drug concentrations were needed to
induce the growth inhibition observed in BxPC-3. Flow
cytometric analysis of Capan-1 cells exposed to 1 and
10 mM erlotinib indicated only a slight increase of %G1
during treatments. In treatments with gemcitabine, cells
initially blocked in G1 and then progressing through S
phase as a partially synchronized subpopulation were seen
in samples exposed to 100 nM.
As Capan-1 cells could not be reliably tracked in TL
movies because of their morphology and their piled-up,
cluster-like spatial distribution, we partly bypassed the lack
of TL data by fitting flow cytometric cell cycle percentages
with the absolute cell number obtained with the Coulter
counter at different times during and after treatment. We
fitted both flow cytometric percentages and cell numbers
(Figure 4A) with the model developed with the richer
BxPC-3 dataset, considering the same kind of cell cycle
perturbations and optimizing the parameters’ values.
Capan-1 exposed to 1 mM erlotinib were able
to divide regularly and the simplest model explaining
the data required only a moderate block in G1 phase
for cells in generation 1, with blocked cells exiting at
the end of treatment and progressing regularly through
the other phases (Figure 4B). In 10-mM treated cells,
the perturbations were stronger in G1 and S phases,
with reduced progression of the cells in generation 0,
and only a very small percentage was intercepted by
the G2M checkpoint. A fraction of the cells that were
able to divide once (generation 1) were blocked in G1
and were progressively released after drug washout
(see G1 recycling rate), then slightly delayed in S phase
(Figure 4B). 10 mM erlotinib was only cytostatic, while
some cell death was seen in BxPC-3.
The final models of Capan-1 treated with
gemcitabine showed a 23% reduction of DNA synthesis
rate in cells treated with 30 nM, and almost complete
reduction with 100 nM (95%) (Figure 4C). In both
samples, synthesis restarted after drug removal with
kinetics similar to that of BxPC-3 cells, reaching about
50% of the normal value at 18 h. Similarly to BxPC-3,
cells that were initially in G2M divided regularly and were
delayed in generation 1. The G1 delay experienced by
Capan-1 exposed to 100 nM was similar to that of BxPC3 treated with 40 nM. The perturbation of G2M phase

Gemcitabine
A model including delay and death only in S phase
explained the trend of the observed data, but significantly
better fits were obtained including a delay, without death,
in G1 and further refinement led to include a modest,
although dose-dependent, G2M block.
Gemcitabine immediately reduced the DNA
synthesis rate (by 88% at 20 nM and with a complete
inhibition at higher concentrations) maintaining the effect
even after discontinuation of treatment. DNA synthesis
gradually restarted, reaching about 50% of the normal
rate at 18 h (Figure 3A – generation 0). This caused the
formation of a wave of semi-synchronized cells, detected
by FC analysis of DNA content (Supplementary Figure 4).
According to the model, the timing of the restart of DNA
synthesis was not dose-dependent, but recovery was
incomplete at higher concentrations, maintaining a long
term S delay. Cells treated with 20 nM that recovered from
S-phase block eventually divided, and their descendants
regularly cycled, while at higher concentrations, cells
progressed slowly and those still in generation 0 at 48 h or
in generation 1 at 72 h were committed to die (Figure 3B).
The death rate with 120 nM was similar or lower than
that with 40 nM, but the number of dead cells was much
higher, because most cells were still in generations 0 and 1
when death occurred, while many 40-nM treated cells had
already reached higher generations and survived.
In addition to S-phase related events, gemcitabine
induced a strong G1 delay during treatment (generation 0).
The delay was already active with 20 nM, and recovery
times were dose-dependent, from 6 h (20 nM) to 27 h

of cells that had recovered from the S-phase delay in
generation 0 was confirmed as a secondary effect, present
only at 100 nM. Cell death was not demonstrated by the
modeling, suggesting that the effects of gemcitabine were
prevalently cytostatic and not cytotoxic even at the highest
concentration (Figure 4C).

both schedules were close to additivity, with a synergistic
trend in G→E (IC50) and an antagonist trend in E→G. In
Capan-1 both sequences were synergistic, more at IC50
than at IC30. Simultaneous treatment led to higher CI in
both cell lines, confirming the superiority of the sequential
treatment.
The isobologram analysis provides a rough
evaluation of the complexity of the response to treatment,
nevertheless these results represented a first indication
of the efficacy of the combined treatments that could be
compared with other published studies. These preliminary
experiments enabled to span the whole concentrationresponse range and were used to select the concentrations
adopted in the subsequent detailed study.
To clarify the origin of the interaction suggested by
the long-term SRB assay, we treated BxPC-3 and Capan-1
cells with low-effective concentrations of erlotinib (1 and
10 mM) and gemcitabine (20 and 40 nM for BxPC-3;
30 and 100 nM for Capan-1) in the two sequences. Cell

Combined treatments
As previous studies [9, 25] had demonstrated the
superiority of sequential over simultaneous treatment with
erlotinib and gemcitabine, we focused on two different
sequences. In the first (G→E), 6 h incubation with
gemcitabine was followed, after 18 h, by 48 h treatment
with erlotinib, while in the second (E→G), the order of the
two drugs was inverted, with the same interval.
Isobolograms of the two schedules and simultaneous
72 h treatment at different levels of efficacy (IC30 and
IC50) are shown in Supplementary Figure 6. In BxPC-3

count and DNA distributions (Supplementary Figures 7
and 8 – FC analysis) were collected for samples treated
with single drugs or the combination at the end of the
second treatment and 24 h later. Interpretation of these
data required the support of modeling, because they are
the result of the kinetics of checkpoint activation during
the second treatment, intertwined with the history of each
cohort of cells that flows through the cycle starting from
different cell cycle positions as a consequence of the
previous treatment.

effects after treatment is the most probable source of a
synergistic trend of this scheme, as was consistently
predicted by the best models of all treatment groups, and
is the only change required in the 40G→10E model. A
reduction of the G1 block during the erlotinib treatment
was suggested by the 40G→1E and 20G→10E best
models, which on one hand reduces the cytostatic effect
but on the other increases the number of cells entering S
phase, where cell death occurred.

Capan-1: G→E

Analysis of combined treatment: results of the
simulation

Data for the combinations 30G→1E and 30G→10E
were reasonably fitted with the erlotinib model without
correction, but modifications were required for samples pretreated with 100 nM (Figure 5B). The best models of both
100G→1E and 100G→10E (Table 1B) suggested that the
G1 block was weakened or abolished and the DNA synthesis
was strongly inhibited immediately after addition of
erlotinib, without the 6 h lag observed with single treatment.
The modest residual long term S-phase delay caused by
gemcitabine was strengthened by the second drug. Thus
potentiation of the effects against the cells traversing S
phase may lead to synergism of the combination, with a
mechanism acting in S phase before their division.

The models simulating single drug treatments,
described above, were assumed to assess the expected
effect of the combined treatment in the absence of drug
interaction, and then compared with the data from the
combination experiments.

BxPC-3: G→E
At 24 h, when erlotinib was added, cells treated with
gemcitabine presented a wave of semi-synchronized cells
in S phase (see Figure 1B). The simulation ran with the
gemcitabine single-treatment best model until erlotinib
was added (24 h), then the cell cycle distribution reached
at this time was applied as starting point for the erlotinib
model.
Cell cycle percentages 48 h after the addition of
erlotinib (72 h) and 24 h after its removal (96 h) were
compared with those expected from the erlotinib model
(Figure 5A). At 96 h the data indicated a lower %G1 and
higher %G2M than with the erlotinib model. To reproduce
these data we had to correct the erlotinib models as shown
in Table 1A. Potentiation of the S and G2M cytostatic

BxPC-3: E→G
As shown in Figure 5C, the reference gemcitabine
models were unable to predict experimental data properly,
requiring refinement of the parameters in all phases
(Table 2A). Generation 0 cells showed a trend toward
a stronger G1 delay in the short term, confirmed in all
treatment groups, and increased delays/block in S and
G2M in the long term, which may counteract the cell death
expected after removal of gemcitabine.

Capan-1: E→G

Despite the different genetic backgrounds of the two
cell lines, some common hallmarks could be indentified
in the effects on the proteins involved in the downstream
signaling of the EGFR pathway.
Phosphorylation of ERK and AKT showed opposite
constitutive levels in BxPC-3 (high pT308-AKT and low
pERK, lanes 1a, 1c) and Capan-1 (low pT308-AKT and
high pERK, lanes 1b, 1d). In BxPC-3, single erlotinib
treatment caused reduction of both pERK and pT308AKT at the end of exposure (3a) and 24 h later (6a) while
in Capan-1 their constitutive levels remained (3b, 6b). In
BxPC-3 the G→E combination maintained low levels of
pT308-AKT but pERK was not reduced (4a, 7a), while
in Capan-1 the response to erlotinib was not affected by
gemcitabine pre-treatment (4b, 7b).
In Capan-1 pERK and pT308-AKT rose
immediately at the end of gemcitabine treatment (3d),

Experimental data from Capan-1 cells were
reasonably reproduced by strengthening the delay in G1
(100 nM gemcitabine only) and S phase (Figure 5D and
Table 2B). Thus, in a scenario where cytotoxic effects were
almost negligible, erlotinib pre-treatment strongly hampered
the resumption of cycle progression after gemcitabine.

Western blot analysis in drug combination
schedules
The pathways involved in cell responses to the
single and combined treatments were investigated by
western blot analysis at the end of the combined treatment
(72 h) and 24 h later (96 h), with the highest drug
concentrations used in the combination studies (Figure 6).

Parameters of gemcitabine or the combination E→G were compared for BxPC-3 (panel A) and Capan-1 (panel B).

whereas in BxPC-3 AKT phosphorylation did not increase
(3c) and pERK increased only long time after treatment
(2a). Erlotinib pre-treatment reduced the levels of pERK
and pT308-AKT only in Capan-1 (4d, 7d); in BxPC-3
it did not change the status of pERK and pT308-AKT
determined by gemcitabine (4c and 7c).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Western blot analysis of cell cycle checkpointrelated proteins showed only a few differences in the
effects of the combinations compared to the single drugs.
Chk1 was activated immediately at the end of gemcitabine
(72 h in the schedule E→G) in both cell lines (pS317Chk1 3c, 3d), followed by a decrease at 24 h, parallel with

the strong inhibition of DNA synthesis and its recovery.
In BxPC-3, pS317-Chk1 was reduced by erlotinib pretreatment (4c) but remained highly present in Capan-1
(4d). At 96 h, phosphorylation in both cell lines treated
with E→G was undetectable (7c, 7d).
Erlotinib did not activate Chk1 in either cell line
(pT14/Y15-Cdk1 3a, 3b and 6a, 6b), while high p27 levels
were detected at the end of drug exposure (3a, 3b), falling
back to basal values 24 h later (6a, 6b), parallel to the
presence of a G1 block and its release after drug removal.
In BxPC-3, the G→E combination maintained the high
expression of p27, pT14/Y15-Cdk1 and pY15-Cdk2 at 96 h
(7a), while in Capan-1 the response to erlotinib was not
substantially modified by gemcitabine pre-treatment (4b, 7b).
p27 was up-regulated in BxPC-3 long after
gemcitabine (2a, 5a) in the absence of any G1 block but in
presence of cell death. This effect might also explain the
long-term over-expression of p27 in the G→E group (7a).
In Capan-1 cells, where cell death was negligible, we did
not detect any p27 upregulation (2b, 5b).

No effects of gemcitabine on Cdk1 phosphorylation
were immediately detectable at the end of treatment (3c,
3d), but pT14/Y15-Cdk1 levels were high 24 h later in
both cell lines (6c, 6d). This was in agreement with the
progression in G2M at this time of the wave of semisynchronized cells originating in S phase. pT14/Y15Cdk1 expression was reduced in the E→G group. As
regards G1/S-related proteins, gemcitabine and E→G
treatment increased pY15-Cdk2 at 96 h in both cell lines
(6c, 6d and 7c, 7d), coherently with the presence of G1
and S delay.

DISCUSSION
Although EGFR signaling inhibition strategies have
been investigated for years, studies on cell cycle effects of
these compounds alone or in combinations have not yet
analyzed the time- and dose-dependence of their cytostatic
and cytotoxic effects and the origin of the potentiation
with a combination.

EGFR pathway and on cell cycle checkpoint-related proteins. Western blot analysis showing protein levels in BxPC-3

and Capan-1 cells treated with G→E (panels A and B) and E→G (panel C and D). In all experimental groups, cells were treated with
the single drugs (10 mM erlotinib, respectively 40 and 100 nM gemcitabine for BxPC-3 and Capan-1) or the combination and protein
extracts were taken at the end of the last treatment (72 h) and 24 h after drug washout (96 h). Single treated samples were incubated with
the drug at the same times scheduled for the combination (0–6 h for gemcitabine in the G→E group and 66–72 h in the E→G group;
24–72 h for erlotinib in the G→E group and 0–48 h in the E→G group). RAN and actin were used as loading controls.

The cell response to a drug comprises a complex
sequence of events superimposed on a widely heterogeneous
environment where some cells die, some do not proliferate
at all, and some divide once or more during the observation
period. This heterogeneity explains, at least in part, the
failure of early attempts to optimize treatment schedules
based on cell kinetics or synchronization. Alternative
rationales have been proposed to design more efficacious
treatments, for instance testing drug combinations able to
preserve the population of normal cells [26–28]. For this
aim, pretreatments with low doses of kinase inhibitors
were investigated, as they can arrest the growth in normal
cells, protecting them from subsequent chemotherapy,
and contemporaneously sensitize cycling cancer cells to
apoptosis induced by chemotherapy [29–32]. However,
to exploit in practice theoretically sound rationales of
combined treatments, it is essential to understand the
antiproliferative effects of a second drug on cells which had
received a first insults, e.g. with a compound silencing a
specific target, and are not completely recovered.
We look into the complexity of the antiproliferative
response to treatment using different techniques
(principally FC and TL microscopy) and decoding
the components of the response by simulation. This
experimental/computational approach, able to quantify
the activity of the checkpoints involved in the treatment,
has been already applied in studies of the effects induced
by cisplatin [13], taxol [14], topotecan [15], doxorubicin
[17], melphalan [16], trabectedin [33] and radiation [20].
Here we apply the same method to study sequential
treatments with erlotinib and gemcitabine in two pancreatic
cancer cell lines (BxPC-3 and Capan-1) with different
genetic backgrounds. This combination has been already
considered in clinical studies for treatment of pancreatic
cancer, however it is the first time that a full disclosure
of the cell cycling during and after treatment with these
drugs, singly and in sequence, is reported, illustrating the
dynamics of the activity of cell cycle checkpoints.
Working in the range of concentrations
corresponding to those observed in the plasma of patients
treated with erlotinib (1–10 mM) [34], we found an
important role for the S-phase checkpoint, not recognized
in previous studies of cell cycle perturbations induced
by EGFR inhibitors [35]. In BxPC-3 cells, erlotinib up
to 10 mM had a prevalently cytostatic effect. Cytotoxic
effects prevailed at higher concentrations, with cells dying
in S phase. Thus the G1 checkpoint did not drive the cells
towards apoptosis but acted as a protective mechanism,
preventing cells reaching the more sensitive S phase where
erlotinib exerted its cytotoxic effects.
The gemcitabine model indicated that the kinetics
of cell responses was dominated by the timing of the
S-phase checkpoint, which remained active several hours
after the time of drug exposure. Full recovery of the DNA
replication rate was achieved only at low gemcitabine
concentrations, whereas in samples exposed to more
cytotoxic doses the cells that did not complete generation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

1 at 72 h eventually died in S phase. The same models
of response to treatment were successfully applied to
Capan-1 cells, even though at higher concentrations than
those used in BxPC-3.
The time- and dose-dependence of the effects of
erlotinib and gemcitabine singly was used to interpret their
interactions in sequential treatments (G→E and E→G
with 18 h interval). Cells were hit by the second treatment
while recovering from the effects of the first, which were
not yet over.
The positive interaction of the G→E scheme
originated from potentiation of the cytostatic effects in
S phase, with an immediate strong delay in Capan-1 and
potentiation of S and G2M delays after the end of erlotinib
in BxPC-3. This sequence was particularly favorable
when a weakly effective erlotinib concentration followed
a gemcitabine concentration causing an important S-phase
arrest (like in 100G→1E sequence in Capan-1).
In BxPC-3 the E→G sequence caused an imbalance
in the response to gemcitabine in cell cycle phases,
strengthening G1 block and re-modulating the S-phase
arrest, weaker in the short term but longer and associated
with a G2M block. However, the added value of erlotinib
pre-treatment on G1 and S short-term cytostatic effects
was modest, also considering that at these times erlotinib
induced an S delay that obviously could not boost the
almost complete S-phase arrest induced by gemcitabine.
The long-term G2M block may in part counteract the
cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine. The balance of these
effects is in keeping with the nearly additive effect in the
SRB test. In Capan-1 the S-phase short-term delay was
strengthened with 30 nM gemcitabine, while combinations
with higher concentrations greatly increased the G1 delay
in the short term and the residual S delay in the long term.
Knowing that the effect of the erlotinib and
gemcitabine combination is a consequence of both cell
cycle and growth factor signaling interactions [11, 36], we
investigated some molecular pathways affected by these
two drugs, especially those that might have an important
role in the combination. In agreement with the literature
[10, 37, 38], erlotinib and gemcitabine influenced the
activity of the KRAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways,
though in different ways. In KRAS wt BxPC-3 cells,
EGFR inhibitors inactivated ERK, while pERK had to be
increased by gemcitabine for apoptosis [37]. Erlotinib’s
ability to inactivate ERK in BxPC-3 was partially reversed
by the G→E combination and might be an important
determinant of synergism [21].
This pathway was regulated differently in cells
harboring the KRAS mutation (Capan-1) but, according
to Bartholomeusz et al. [10], in this case the molecular
mechanism behind the synergism might be a decrease
in pT308-AKT expression, clearly observed at 72 h in
Capan-1 treated with the E→G sequence. Other effects
on the expression of cell cycle-related proteins can be
interpreted as a consequence of cell cycle redistribution
and the effects on KRAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways.

Time-lapse

Generally, the G→E sequence was preferable, since
it was synergistic/additive in both cell lines, although there
was no frank antagonism even with the opposite schedule.
This might be a result of the 18 h interval between the two
treatments, that enabled most G1 cells arrested by erlotinib
to exit the block, avoiding the mechanism of antagonism
reported for the simultaneous treatment, according to which
G1 blocked cells are poorly sensitive to gemcitabine [11, 39].
As concerns the interval in the G→E sequence
our analysis indicated that the timing of recycling from
G1/S phase arrest did not depend on the gemcitabine
concentration; it was the same in both cell lines and cells
exiting from the block took several hours to complete
S phase. That means that the optimal interval between
treatments may range from 18 h to 24 h or more [40],
making this rationale possible for in vivo translation. We
also found that low, modestly effective concentrations
such as 1 mM were enough to enhance gemcitabine’s
effect. However, this is not guaranteed in all patients
inside a poorly vascularised pancreatic carcinoma with
desmoplastic stroma, despite plasma levels above 10 mM.
Insufficient drug delivery to the tumor site probably
contributed to the statistical lack of improvement observed
in a recent trial where a G→E sequence with one day
interval was studied [41]. The trial was suspended due
to lack of funding after recruitment of only 30 patients
but no unexpected toxicity was observed. We believe that
with ongoing improvements in drug delivery, targeting the
microenvironment or using new drug carriers [42, 43], the
efficacy of treatments in general and of the G→E scheme
in particular could be boosted.

Cells were seeded in a multi-well plate, 24 h
later the plate was placed on a time-lapse instrument
designed to capture phase contrast images (Imaging
Station Cell^R, Olympus). Sequences were captured
every 20 minutes for 96 h, for one field for each well.
We analyzed five replicate wells for each experimental
condition [20]. BxPC-3 cells were followed up to 96 h or
four generations, but Capan-1 lineage in TL movies could
be reliably tracked only in controls up to the first division
because of their morphology and their piled-up, clusterlike distribution.

Analysis of combination treatment
To evaluate the effect of the combination of erlotinib
and gemcitabine we used a standard growth inhibition
assay with Sulforhodamine B detection. Cells were seeded
in 96-well plates, treated 24 h later and after drug washout
were left in drug-free medium up to seven days [40].
Using a factorial experimental design, each schedule was
tested in at least two independent experiments, each with
four independent replicate plates.
Data were analyzed using the isobologram method
[45]. Cells were exposed to a range of doses of both drugs
and combined concentrations inducing 30% and 50%
growth inhibition were calculated by fitting dose–response
curves of erlotinib at each gemcitabine concentration and
vice versa. To quantify the interaction, we calculated
the Combination Index (CI) for each pair of drug
concentrations tested, according to the Lowe additivity
criterion [46].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and drug treatment

Western blot analysis

Capan-1 and BxPC-3 cells were maintained
as monolayers in T-25 cm2 tissue culture flasks
(Iwaki) according to ATCC instructions. Culture was
maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 in air, at 37°C
and 96% relative humidity. Exponentially growing
cells were treated with erlotinib (Selleckchem) and/
or gemcitabine (Lilly). After treatment the cells were
washed twice with warm PBS and left in drug-free
medium. At each time cells from three replicated flasks
were detached, using 1 mL 0.05% trypsin-0.02% EDTA
(Cambrex) in PBS, counted with a Coulter Counter ZM
(Coulter Electronics), then pooled and fixed in cold
70% ethanol.

Proteins were extracted and visualized using
standard techniques as already described [47]. Specifically,
primary anti Chk1 (G4), pT14/Y15-Cdk1, Cdk1, Cdk2,
pERK, ERK, p27 and actin were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Primary anti pS317-Chk1, pT308AKT and AKT were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology. Primary anti pY15-Cdk2 was purchased
from Abcam. The mouse monoclonal anti-Ran (clone 20)
is from BD Transduction Laboratories.
