ABSTRACT
Mutations in the ALK tyrosine kinase receptor gene represent important
therapeutic targets in neuroblastoma, yet their clinical translation has been
challenging. The ALKF1174L mutation is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib only at
high doses and mediates acquired resistance to crizotinib in ALK-translocated cancers.
We have shown that the combination of crizotinib and an inhibitor of downstream
signaling induces a favorable response in transgenic mice bearing ALKF1174L/MYCNpositive neuroblastoma. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of this effect and
assessed whether a similar strategy would be effective in ALK-mutated tumors lacking
MYCN overexpression. We show that in ALK-mutated, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma
cells, crizotinib alone does not affect mTORC1 activity as indicated by persistent
RPS6 phosphorylation. Combined treatment with crizotinib and an ATP-competitive
mTOR inhibitor abrogated RPS6 phosphorylation, leading to reduced tumor growth
and prolonged survival in ALKF1174L/MYCN-positive models compared to single agent
treatment. By contrast, this combination, while inducing mTORC1 downregulation,
caused reciprocal upregulation of PI3K activity in ALK-mutated cells expressing wildtype MYCN. Here, an inhibitor with potency against both mTOR and PI3K was more
effective in promoting cytotoxicity when combined with crizotinib. Our findings should
enable a more precise selection of molecularly targeted agents for patients with ALKmutated tumors.

strategies against this often-fatal childhood cancer of the

FDA approval - has limited activity against the various
ALK mutations identified in patients with NB [4]. Indeed,
in a Children’s Oncology Group (COG) trial, only 1 of
11 patients with ALK-mutated NB had an objective
response to this agent [4]. When tested against NB cells
bearing either of the two more common mutations,
crizotinib inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in cells
expressing ALKR1275Q but failed to inhibit the growth of
ALKF1174L-positive cells [5, 6]. Similarly, in the COG trial,
3 of the 4 patients with ALKF1174L–positive NB tumors
developed progressive disease, compared with 2 of 5
whose tumors had a missense mutation at the R1275 locus
[4]. This relative resistance of ALKF1174L to crizotinib has
been attributed to the increased ATP-binding affinity of the
mutant, with complete inhibition of constitutively active
ALK attainable only at very high doses of the drug [5].
ALKF1174L is thus considered the most aggressive of all ALK
mutations in NB, possessing higher transforming potential
and segregating with MYCN oncogene amplification,
itself a marker of aggressive disease in high-risk NB
[7]. Importantly, ALKF1174L also arises secondarily as
a mechanism of resistance after an initial response to
crizotinib in patients with ALK-rearranged cancers [8].
Although several other compounds are in
development or in early-phase trials [9], there is no
certainty that these compounds will be any more potent
than crizotinib against mutant ALK. Therefore, novel
strategies that increase the efficacy of crizotinib in
ALK-mutated NB, without resorting to doses that could
cause irreversible toxicity in children, are particularly
relevant. One promising strategy has been the combined
use of agents that target not only aberrant ALK, but also
other signaling nodes whose activation by mutant ALK
contributes to the malignant phenotype [10]. Based
on activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in a murine
transgenic NB model expressing ALKF1174L and MYCN,
we demonstrated that combining an ATP-competitive
mTOR inhibitor with crizotinib induced tumor regression,
although the molecular basis for this result was unclear at
the time [6].
The mTOR protein kinase is selectively activated
in anaplastic large cell and T-cell lymphomas that are
positive for the NPM-ALK chromosomal translocation
[11]; however, its role in NB cells expressing the fulllength mutated ALK receptor remains to be defined.
mTOR signaling occurs in the context of at least two
multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that
are key components of the PI3K/AKT network and are
activated by growth factors and metabolic status. The
mTORC1 complex is a critical mediator of cell growth
and metabolism and regulates cell size and protein
synthesis through its substrates p70S6K and 4E-BP1
[12]. Activated p70S6K phosphorylates RPS6, an S6
protein of the 40S ribosomal subunit, which in turn
causes feedback inhibition of insulin-like growth factor
1 (IGF-1) signaling by phosphorylating insulin receptor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

substrate 1 (IRS-1), leading to its degradation [13, 14].
The mTORC2 complex, which is also activated by growth
factor stimulation, regulates cell proliferation and survival
through direct phosphorylation of AKT on serine 473 [12].
Here, we sought to dissect the critical components
of ALKF1174L-associated signaling in the presence of MYCN
overexpression to identify the molecular determinants of
the favorable response to combined crizotinib/mTOR
inhibitor therapy previously demonstrated using the THALKF1174L/MYCN transgenic model [6]. Moreover, we
investigated whether this combination would be just as
effective in ALK-mutated NB models in the absence of
MYCN amplification. We show that in cells overexpressing
both ALKF1174L and MYCN, there is persistent activation
of mTORC1 in the context of single-agent crizotinib
treatment. Thus, targeting mTORC1 in combination with
ALK leads to enhanced antitumor efficacy and prolongs
survival in mouse xenograft models of human NB
coexpressing ALKF1174L and MYCN. By contrast, in cells
without MYCN amplification, this combination, although
inducing downregulation of mTORC1, led to reciprocal
upregulation of PI3K activity not only in ALKF1174Lmutated cells but also in those that express the more
common ALKR1275Q-mutation. In this instance, an inhibitor
with equal potency against mTOR and PI3K was more
effective in promoting cytotoxicity when combined with
crizotinib. Our results provide a molecular rationale for
the selection of targeted agents to prevent or delay the
onset of resistance in patients with ALK-mutated NB.

RESULTS
PI3K/AKT but not mTOR is inhibited by
crizotinib in ALKF1174L/MYCN-positive NB cells
To probe the signaling networks in crizotinib-treated
NB cells harboring the ALKF1174L mutation and amplified
MYCN, we exposed Kelly NB cells (which express both
genes) to crizotinib or vehicle for 6 hours and analyzed
their gene expression profiles. High doses of crizotinib
were required to downregulate phosphorylation of ALK
at Y1604 (Fig. 1A). Using comparative marker selection
methods and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we
identified a number of significantly enriched gene sets in
crizotinib-treated cells whose transcripts were functionally
linked to protein kinase, insulin receptor, mTOR signaling,
MYC, E2F and PTEN pathways. Surprisingly however, the
majority of the PI3K/mTOR pathway transcripts were not
uniformly downregulated in the crizotinib-treated cells,
suggesting inadequate suppression of the pathway by
crizotinib even at high doses (Supplementary Table 1).
To determine whether these findings extend to
the protein level, we treated Kelly cells with doses of
crizotinib similar to those used for the expression analysis

and analyzed the three main targets of both mTOR
and PI3K signaling: pRPS6 and p4E-BP1, markers of
mTORC1 activation, as well as phosphorylation of AKT
at serine 473 and threonine 308, markers of mTORC2 and
PI3K activation, respectively. We observed that relatively
high doses of crizotinib for 6 hours were associated with
a decrease in phosphorylation of AKTT308 and AKTS473
(Fig. 1B). However, pRPS6 was unaffected and p4E-BP1
was even upregulated on exposure to crizotinib (Fig. 1B).
Thus, in MYCN-amplified NB cells expressing ALKF1174L,
crizotinib effectively downregulated mTORC2 and PI3K,
but had no appreciable inhibitory effect on mTORC1
activity.
We next asked whether these differential
downstream signaling changes also occur with genetic
depletion of mutated ALK. Abrogation of ALK expression
by stable shRNA transduction led to decreases in pAKT
at S473 and T308 but not pRPS6 in Kelly cells. The
same phenomenon was observed in MYCN-amplified
NGP cells that express non-mutated, non-amplified but
phosphorylated ALK (Fig. 1C). Together, these studies
indicate that in MYCN-amplified NB cells, efficient
depletion of activated ALK causes differential effects
on downstream signaling: PI3K and mTORC2 are
downregulated, while mTORC1 activity is maintained.

of mTORC1 activity in NB cells expressing activated
ALK. To test this hypothesis, we abolished the expression
of MYCN in MYCN-amplified, ALKF1174L-expressing
Kelly cells using shRNA knockdown, and tested whether
mTORC1 substrates pRPS6 and p4E-BP1 were affected.
Partial knockdown of MYCN that still maintained cell
viability did not lead to appreciable changes in pRPS6
levels. However, the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at
residues associated with mTORC1-mediated inhibition
(T37/46) [15] were downregulated at the level of MYCN
knockdown achieved (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we observed
upregulation of pAKT upon MYCN knockdown (Fig. 2A),
consistent with a loss of feedback inhibition associated
with reduced mTORC1 activity. To inhibit MYCN
expression completely and to further clarify the extent to
which it contributes to mTORC1 activity in the presence
of mutated ALK, we overexpressed ALKF1174L in the
SHEP NB cell line, which stably expresses a tetracyclinerepressible MYCN construct (Fig. 2B). Addition of
doxycycline to ALKF1174L-positive SHEP cells led to
depletion of MYCN expression, which was associated
with a significant decrease in pRPS6 levels compared
with cells in which MYCN was expressed (Fig. 2B).
Interestingly, we also noted that pRPS6 expression was
decreased in GFP-expressing SHEP cells when MYCN
was repressed (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that MYCN
contributes to mTORC1 activation.
We next explored the effects of MYCN
overexpression in ALKF1174L-positive cells upon exposure
to crizotinib. As noted previously, we again observed a
decrease in pRPS6 levels in DMSO-treated cells when
MYCN expression was shut off by the addition of
doxycycline (Doxycycline +) (Fig. 2C). Inhibition of

MYCN amplification determines downstream
signaling responses to crizotinib in ALK-mutated
cells
The above results suggested that deregulated
MYCN could contribute to the sustained upregulation

MYCN expression in both GFP and ALKF1174L-positive
SHEP cells led to a decrease in RPS6 phosphorylation
compared with results in MYCN-overexpressing cells
(p<0.05; Fig. 2C). Crizotinib also led to significant
downregulation of pAKTS473 levels in MYCN
overexpressing cells (Fig. 2C), but not in cells in which
MYCN expression was repressed (Doxycycline +), where
pAKTS473 levels remained elevated. Similarly, MYCN
repression led to elevation of pAKTT308 (hence PI3K) in
SHEP cells, which was further increased on exposure
to crizotinib, consistent with continued loss of RPS6mediated feedback inhibition (Fig. 2C). Thus, in ALKF1174L
cells without MYCN overexpression, crizotinib eventually
induced downregulation of mTORC1, with both mTORC2
and PI3K remaining activated. In contrast, induction of
MYCN expression led to downregulation of mTORC2,
while sustaining persistent activation of mTORC1. These
findings demonstrate that amplified MYCN maintains
mTORC1 activity in NB cells and contributes to a varied
response in AKT activity following crizotinib treatment.

PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors in NB cells (Table S2),
identifying Torin1 [16] and Torin2 [17] as promising
candidates. Although Torin1, an ATP-competitive mTOR
inhibitor [16] with preferential activity against mTOR
(EC50, 3 nM) compared to PI3K (EC50, 1.8 µM), exhibited
impressive cytotoxicity with downregulation of mTORC1
and mTORC2 targets in Kelly NB cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B), it has a low-yielding synthetic route,
poor water solubility, limited oral bioavailability and a
short half-life. These restrictions led us to test a secondgeneration analogue, Torin2 [17], which proved more
potent than Torin1 against mTOR (EC50, 0.25 nM) as well
as PI3K (EC50, 200 nM), and led to a decrease in both
pAKTS473 and pRPS6 levels (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Because of its reported lack of sustained cytotoxic activity
as a single agent [17], we next asked whether Torin2
would enhance the sensitivity of ALKF1174L-expressing NB
cells to crizotinib. Indeed, the combination of Torin2 and
crizotinib reduced the viability of both Kelly and LAN1 (ALKF1174L-positive/MYCN amplified) cells beyond that
achieved by either single agent alone (Fig. 3A). Growth
inhibition in Kelly cells was accompanied by a G0-G1 cell
cycle arrest (Fig. 3B), although a significant increase in
apoptosis was not observed (Supplementary Fig. S2A and
S2B).
Further testing of this combination in both Kelly
and LAN-1 cell lines using synergistic doses of each
compound elicited a striking and sustained decrease in
phosphorylated RPS6 and 4E-BP1 as well as AKTS473,
confirming the targeted inhibition of the mTORC1 and
mTORC2 complexes (Fig. 3C). Torin2 as a single agent

A selective mTOR inhibitor enhances the effect
of crizotinib in MYCN-amplified ALKF1174Lexpressing NB cells
The above findings suggest that continued or
compensatory upregulation of key signaling molecules
during crizotinib treatment could contribute to the limited
activity of this agent against NB cells expressing ALKF1174L
with concomitant overexpression of MYCN. To address
this issue, we screened several mTOR, PI3K and dual

caused an increase in the marker of PI3K activation,
pAKTT308, suggesting loss of feedback inhibition by
mTORC1. However, the combination of Torin2 and
crizotinib led to downregulation of pAKTT308 in both
cell lines (Fig. 3C). Together, these results show that
an mTOR-specific inhibitor can augment the cytotoxic
activity of crizotinib in ALKF1174L-mutated NB cells with
MYCN amplification.

the transgenic NB model [6], we sought to determine
whether similar results would be observed in models of
human disease. Therefore, we tested the crizotinib/Torin2
combination in human NB xenograft models generated
by subcutaneous injection of Kelly cells into NSG mice.
When tumors reached an optimal size (tumor volume,
~60mm3), the mice were separated into four groups (n = 8
each) and treated orally once daily with vehicle, crizotinib
(75 mg/kg), Torin2 (20 mg/kg), or a combination of the
two. Mice were treated in “cycles”, each consisting of
5 days on and 5 days off treatment for a total of three
cycles, to mimic clinical use of these drugs as closely as
possible. Crizotinib by itself lacked any apparent activity,
while Torin2 significantly suppressed tumor growth at
18 days (Fig. 4A), although this result did not translate
to prolonged survival (Fig. 4B). Combination treatment,
by contrast, significantly attenuated tumor growth and

4C). This paucity of morphologic alterations correlated
with a lack of effect of crizotinib on pALK and on the
expression of either mTORC1 (pRPS6 and p4E-BP1)
or mTORC2 (pAKTS473) targets (Fig. 4D). In fact, on
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, pRPS6 appeared
to be upregulated in the crizotinib-treated tumors (Fig.
4C). The profile of molecular events seen with singleagent therapy contrasted sharply with that induced by
the crizotinib/Torin2 combination. Indeed, there was a
striking decrease in AKTS473 phosphorylation as well as the
virtual disappearance of pRPS6 and p4E-BP1 on western
analysis of treated tumor cells (Fig. 4D). This dramatic
decrease in mTORC1 signaling was confirmed by IHC
showing downregulation of pRPS6 (Fig. 4C). Moreover,
the combination also led to an increase in tumor cell death
by H&E and cleaved caspase-3 staining, compared with

either agent alone (Fig. 4C). Together, these results show
that the combination of crizotinib and an mTOR inhibitor
can be used both safely and effectively in human NB
models.

lateral tail vein injection, with bioluminescence used to
assess engraftment in the liver 6 days later. At 10 days
post injection, repeat imaging revealed increased tumor
burden with metastases to many organs, including bone
marrow and lungs, reminiscent of human stage 4 NB. At
this point, mice were divided into four treatment groups
based on similar mean bioluminescence intensities (n = 8
per group) and received vehicle, crizotinib (100 mg/kg),
Torin2 (20 mg/kg), or a combination of these agents, given
in daily oral doses for 10 consecutive days. The standard
dose of crizotinib (100 mg/kg) allowed us to determine its
tolerability in combination with other agents. Mice treated
with the combination of crizotinib and Torin2 showed
signs of toxicity after 6 days of treatment, but these effects
resolved rapidly after cessation of treatment for 6 days, at
which point the combination was restarted and continued
in 5-day on/off cycles as described for the s.c. models.
Serial monitoring of tumors by bioluminescence did not
reveal any significant differences among the treatment
groups until day 21, at which time the cohort treated
with crizotinib plus Torin2 had lower bioluminescence
compared to mice treated with single agents or vehicle
(Fig. 4E and Supplementary Fig. S2C). As in the s.c.
models, monotherapy with crizotinib or Torin2 did not
appreciably affect the tumor burden or survival in our
metastatic model, in contrast to combination therapy,
which resulted in significant suppression of tumor growth
and prolongation of survival (Fig. 4F). These in vivo data
support the use of crizotinib with an mTOR catalytic
inhibitor in patients with ALKF1174L-mutated, MYCNamplified tumors.

is extremely potent against both PI3K and mTOR (IC50
of 0.4 and 1.6 nM, respectively). When combined with
crizotinib, this compound showed synergistic activity in
these cells (Fig. 5C and 5D), leading to the downregulation
of not only mTORC1 and mTORC2, but also PI3K (Fig.
5D). We further validated these findings in CHLA-20
cells that express the more common R1275Q mutation,
suggesting that various ALK mutations respond similarly
to the combination in the setting of non-amplified MYCN.
These findings suggest that mutant ALK-expressing NB
cells with non-amplified MYCN may respond better to an
inhibitor that is equally potent against mTOR and PI3K
when combined with crizotinib.

DISCUSSION
The ALKF1174L mutation, which occurs in NB and
cosegregates with the MYCN oncogene, demonstrates
limited susceptibility to crizotinib both in animal models
and in clinical testing [4, 6]. We have previously shown
that the combination of crizotinib with an mTOR inhibitor
induces responses in transgenic mouse models of NB
positive for ALKF1174L and amplified MYCN [6]. Here, we
provide a molecular basis for this effect, demonstrating
that incomplete inhibition of mTORC1 limits the activity
of crizotinib in NB cells that express both ALKF1174L and
deregulated MYCN. This interpretation is supported by our
observation that concomitant inhibition of mTOR restores
sensitivity to crizotinib in NB models. We also show that
this combination is not as effective in ALK-mutated cells
expressing non-amplified MYCN. In such cells, an agent
with appreciable activity against PI3K as well as mTOR
was most effective when combined with crizotinib.
In cells expressing ALKF1174L and amplified
MYCN, crizotinib treatment had minimal to no effect
on pRPS6 activity, suggesting that MYCN was capable
of maintaining mTORC1 activity in this context. This
prediction was confirmed in MYCN-repressible SHEP
NB cells, where overexpression of MYCN in the presence
of constitutively activated ALKF1174L led to sustained
activation of pRPS6. Moreover, repression or shRNA
knockdown of MYCN led to diminished activation of
mTORC1 targets. In cells expressing mutant ALK and
wild-type MYCN, moreover, exposure to crizotinib
resulted in downregulation of pRPS6 activity, in contrast
to MYCN-amplified cells where pRPS6 was unaffected,
again emphasizing the contribution of deregulated MYCN
to the sustained activation of mTORC1. Thus, persistence
of mTORC1 in the presence of amplified MYCN may
be a general phenomenon in ALKF1174L-mutated, MYCNamplified NB tumors, especially since this mutation
segregates with MYCN amplification [7]. Moreover, it
is likely that in these cells, even newer ALK inhibitors
with higher potency against the mutant kinase, will be
limited by persistent activity of deregulated MYCN. We

mTOR inhibitor is required to induce cytotoxicity
in ALKF1174L-positive NB cells without MYCN
amplification
We next determined whether the combination of
crizotinib and Torin2 would be as effective in ALKF1174Lexpressing SH-SY5Y without MYCN amplification (Fig.
5A and 5B). In contrast to the single agent crizotinib
response in MYCN amplified cells (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3C),
cells with absent MYCN amplification demonstrated
reduced pRPS6 and p4E-BP1 expression (Fig. 5B
and 5D), which is consistent with the hypothesis that
MYCN activity contributes to mTORC1 activation.
In these cells, the combination of Torin2 and crizotinib
led to a decrease in mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling
as evidenced by downregulated pRPS6, p4E-BP1 and
pAKT473, respectively (Fig. 5B). However, this was not
reflected in synergistic or additive cytotoxicity (Fig. 5A),
most likely due to loss of feedback inhibition and the
marked reactivation of pAKTT308 (Fig. 5B). These data
suggested the need for an inhibitor that was also active
against PI3K. Hence, we tested PF-05212384, which

been abrogated, pAKTT308 was upregulated. This reciprocal
relationship illustrates the relief of feedback inhibition by
mTORC1 and appears to occur not only in NB but in other
cancers as well [18, 19]. Such loss of feedback inhibition
has also been shown to activate upstream RTKs [13] thus
questioning the use of downstream signaling inhibitors as
single agents to secure a sustained response.
The ability of MYCN to sustain mTORC1 activity
is consistent with previous reports showing that MYC
overexpression or deregulation activates mTOR signaling
[20]. Indeed, MYC amplification has been observed
more often in cells resistant to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors,
as illustrated by the elevated expression of MYC and
eIF4E in cells that have acquired resistance to the mTOR
inhibitor BEZ235 [21]. The exact mechanism by which
MYCN activates mTORC1 is unclear, but may entail
the repression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
signaling [22] or transcriptional regulation of the
negative mTORC1 regulator TSC2 [23]. As previously
shown, tumors with high levels of MYCN respond
quite dramatically to mTORC1 inhibition, although this

property alone does not appear to be sufficient in tumors
expressing ALKF1174L as well [6].
Figure 6 shows the impact of the ALKF1174L
mutation on PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in NB, and the
opportunities these interactions afford for targeted therapy.
Cells expressing mutant ALK rely on phosphorylation
of AKT at T308 and S473 via ALK-activated PI3K
and mTORC2, respectively, for growth and survival.
Subsequent activation of mTORC1 and RPS6 leads
to inhibition of PI3K, creating a feedback loop that is
needed for fine-tuning of this survival mechanism (Fig.
6A). In this context, crizotinib by itself only marginally
reduces the activities of PI3K and mTORC2 (Fig. 6B).
In cells expressing both the ALKF1174L mutation and
amplified MYCN, mTORC1 activity is maintained by
deregulated MYCN (Fig. 6B). Here the addition of
an mTOR inhibitor such as Torin2 (or any equivalent
clinically available agent) results in a synergistic response
in which the downregulation of mTORC1 complements
the crizotinib-driven inhibition of ALK to suppress PI3K/
AKT activity (Fig. 6D). In cells expressing mutant ALK

Figure 6: Model for combined use of crizotinib and mTOR inhibitors in ALKF1174L-mutated NB cells with MYCN
amplification. A, In ALKF1174L-mutant NB cells, AKT is phosphorylated at T308 and S473 by ALK-activated PI3K and mTORC2,

respectively, promoting cell survival, transcriptional activation through release of 4E-BP1 from eIF4, and ribosome biogenesis
through activation of RPS6. Activation of RPS6 in turn leads to inhibition of PI3K, creating a feedback loop that permits fine-tuning
of proliferative and survival signaling. In MYCN-amplified, ALKF1174L-mutated NB cells, MYCN drives cellular proliferation, leading to
increased dependence on RPS6 and 4E-BP1 activity. B, Treatment of these cells with crizotinib as a single agent inadequately inhibits
mutant ALK, leading to marginally reduced PI3K (pAKTT308) and mTORC2 (pAKTS473) activities and a modest reduction in cell survival.
Although the reduction in pAKT levels leads to a minimal reduction of pRPS6 in MYCN-amplified cells, this response is not sustained, as
deregulated MYCN maintains upregulated mTORC1 activity. C, Single-agent treatment with specific ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors,
such as Torin2, blocks both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity, downregulating pRPS6 and pAKTS473, although amplified MYCN continues
to promote persistent mTORC1 activation and some level of PI3K feedback inhibition. D, The combination of crizotinib and Torin2 in
MYCN-amplified cells targets the activities of PI3K, mTORC1 and mTORC2 simultaneously; continued loss of feedback inhibition of
PI3K activity via incomplete suppression of MYCN/mTORC1/RPS6 signaling synergizes with crizotinib-driven inhibition of ALK to
downregulate PI3K activity and, in turn, AKTT308 phosphorylation.

without deregulated MYCN, the picture is less clear.
Exclusive use of Torin2, although able to completely
downregulate mTORC1 activity in the absence of
MYCN, leads to a much more striking increase of AKT
phosphorylation by PI3K. Such loss of feedback inhibition
leading to reciprocal activation of upstream signaling is a
major limitation of single-agent kinase inhibitor therapy
and suggests that a better result would be obtained by
combining crizotinib with an inhibitor that possesses
potent activity against PI3K as well as mTOR.
Although downstream signaling in cancer cells
depends largely on the specific cell type, mTORC1
activation is a prominent feature of a number of different
cancers that develop resistance to upstream kinase
inhibitors [24, 25]. In PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer cells,
for example, high levels of residual pRPS6 after treatment
with a specific PI3K inhibitor positively correlate with
either intrinsic or acquired resistance to this agent, which
can be reversed by addition of a specific mTORC1
inhibitor [24]. Similarly, mTORC1 activation predicts
responsiveness to RAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAFmutant melanoma; in tumors that do not respond, pRPS6
remains activated and combining mTORC1 inhibition with
RAF or MEK inhibition induces a cytotoxic response [25].
These observations, together with our findings in NB cells,
support aberrant activation of PI3K/mTOR as part of a
mechanism of acquired and/or innate resistance to kinase
inhibitors and raise the possibility of adding PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors to upstream kinase inhibitors at the outset of
therapy.
It is becoming increasingly clear that efforts to
perturb the signaling networks in a tumor cell using
a single upstream inhibitor are likely to be futile. Our
data suggest a need for clinical trials of ALK inhibitors
in combination with downstream pathway inhibitors to
enhance the antitumor activity of the former compounds,
in particular, their ability to overcome the resistance of
ALKF1174L–mutated NB cells to crizotinib. The strategies
described here could also benefit patients with ALKtranslocated cancers, where the F1174L mutation
modulates crizotinib resistance and the same signaling
pathways that drive tumor cells without translocated
ALK are active. Finally, such strategies may be useful in
delaying or even forestalling the development of resistance
to newer ALK inhibitors.

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin.
CHLA-20 human NB cells were cultured in IMDM media
supplemented with 20% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin,
100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 1X Insulin-TransferrinSelenium (Gibco). Cell lines were routinely mycoplasmatested and genotyped at the DFCI Core Facility. Crizotinib
(PF-02341066) and PF-05212384 were obtained from
Pfizer Inc. (New York, NY) through a materials transfer
agreement. Torin1 and Torin2 were synthesized in Dr.
Nathanael Gray’s laboratory. Rapamycin, NVP-BEZ235,
AZD8055, LY294002, and GDC-0941 were purchased
from Selleckchem.com (Houston, TX).

Gene expression and gene set enrichment analyses
(GSEA)
RNA was extracted with TRIzol® reagent according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen) from Kelly
NB cells treated in triplicate with either vehicle (DMSO)
or crizotinib (4 µM) for 6 hours. Gene expression was
evaluated using Affymetrix U133A DNA microarrays
(Affymetrix Inc. Santa Clara, CA). Data analysis was
performed with GenePattern software [26] and GSEA as
described previously [27].

Cell viability assay and drug combination analysis
Viability experiments were performed in triplicate
in 96-well plates and repeated at least three times with
the Cell Proliferation Kit I (Roche) or CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent cell viability assay (Promega, Madison,
WI), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
synergy/additivity analyses were performed in 384- or 96well plate format in two to four replicates and viability
measured using the CellTiter-Glo viability assay as per
the manufacturer’s protocol. Compounds were added
simultaneously at the indicated fixed ratios, and synergy
was assessed using Calcusyn software (Biosoft, Ferguson,
MO), using the Chou-Talalay method [28]. The resulting
concentration pairs at the indicated ratios were visualized
using Prism (GraphPad Software) or by isobologram
(Microsoft Xcel) [29].

Cell Signaling Technologies. Densitometry was performed
using the ImageJ software package and statistical
significance calculated using GraphPad Prism.

All animal experiments were performed following
approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the DFCI. NSG (Nod scid gamma) mice
were used for the in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies.
Subcutaneous model. Animals were injected with 5
x 106 Kelly cells and monitored until tumors appeared.
Tumor volumes were calculated using the spheroid
formula. Mice were divided into four treatment groups
with similar mean tumor volumes (~60 mm3, n=8 per
group) and treated with vehicle, crizotinib (75 mg/kg) p.
o. daily, Torin2 (20 mg/kg) p. o. daily, or a combination
of the two compounds. Treatments were administered in 5
day “cycles”, each consisting of 5 days on and 5 days off,
for a total of three cycles. Tumors were measured at least
once weekly and mice were sacrificed when tumor volume
reached 1500 mm3. Tumors were collected from three
mice per group as they reached the volume threshold;
half of the specimens were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin, while the other half were snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen.
Metastatic model. Fifty 6-week-old NSG mice were
injected in the lateral tail vein with 5 x 106 Kelly-LucmCherry-puro cells. Six days after injection, 3 randomly
selected cages of mice were imaged to determine baseline
tumor burden. Ten days after injection, all mice were
imaged and divided into four treatment groups (8 animals/
group) with similar mean bioluminescence intensities:
vehicle (nuclease-free water, Ambion, AM9916), crizotinib
at 100 mg/kg, Torin2 at 20 mg/kg, or the crizotinib/Torin2
combination. Single agent crizotinib and Torin2 were
given orally once daily for 10 consecutive days. Mice
receiving the combination were treated orally once daily
for 6 days, with treatment then adjusted to 5-day on/off
cycles, (days 1-6, 13-17, and 23-27) to avoid toxicity.
Tumor burden and mouse weights were monitored every
3-5 days by bioluminescence as previously described [32].

Plasmid transfections
The oligos for ALK shRNA #6 were synthesized
as previously described [30], while those for shRNA #8
were designed using the program described in [31]. Oligos
were cloned into the pLKO-1 lentiviral vector containing
the ampicillin resistance cassette. MYCN shRNA
constructs were purchased from the Broad Institute (#1TRCN0000020694, #3-TRCN0000363425). The shRNA
knockdown experiments were performed as previously
described [2]. The ALKF1174L mutation was introduced
into wild type ALK cDNA using the QuickChange II
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Strata-gene), cloned into
the MSCV vector backbone containing the puromycin
selectable marker (Addgene), and transfected into 293T
cells with helper plasmids for virus production. SHEP
cells were transduced with ALKF1174L–positive retrovirus,
followed by puromycin selection for at least 3 days.
MYCN expression in SHEP cells was repressed with 1µg/
ml doxycycline for 24 hr. For the in vivo studies, Kelly
cells were transduced with virus containing the LucmCherry-puro plasmid as described above.

Cell cycle and Annexin V analysis
Kelly cells were treated for 72 hrs. with synergistic/
additive doses of crizotinib (200 nM), Torin2 (20 nM), or
the combination and cell cycle analyses were performed as
previously described [2] or Annexin V staining performed
using the BD Pharmingen FITC Annexin V Apoptosis
Detection Kit I according to manufacturer’s protocol.
