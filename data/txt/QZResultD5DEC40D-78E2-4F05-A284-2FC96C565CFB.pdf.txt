ABSTRACT
Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic forms of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) whose pathogenesis is only poorly understood. Estrogens have
a complex role in inflammation and growing evidence suggests that these hormones
may impact IBD pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrated a significant reduction (p <
0.05) of estrogen receptor (ER)β expression in peripheral blood T lymphocytes from
CD/UC patients with active disease (n = 27) as compared to those in remission (n
= 21) and healthy controls (n = 29). Accordingly, in a subgroup of CD/UC patients
undergoing to anti-TNF-α therapy and responsive to treatment, ERβ expression was
higher (p < 0.01) than that observed in not responsive patients and comparable to
that of control subjects. Notably, ERβ expression was markedly decreased in colonic
mucosa of CD/UC patients with active disease, reflecting the alterations observed in
peripheral blood T cells. ERβ expression inversely correlated with interleukin (IL)-6
serum levels and exogenous exposure of both T lymphocytes and intestinal epithelial
cells to this cytokine resulted in ERβ downregulation. These results demonstrate that
the ER profile is altered in active IBD patients at both mucosal and systemic levels,
at least in part due to IL-6 dysregulation, and highlight the potential exploitation of
T cell-associated ERβ as a biomarker of endoscopic disease activity.

a

in IBD and has been successfully exploited as a target
for therapeutic intervention [3]. However, subgroups
of IBD patients fail to respond or lose response to this
drug indicating that the immune networks in the inflamed
mucosa are complex and subjected to multiple layers of
regulation by still unrecognized factors [3].
Growing evidence from epidemiological and
experimental studies suggests a role for estrogens,
particularly 17β estradiol, in IBD pathogenesis [4-14].
Estrogens have been shown to finely regulate inflammation
[15] and have been implicated in the modulation of several
immune-mediated diseases [16, 17]. Most of their effects
are mediated by two intracellular receptors, i.e, estrogen
receptor (ER)α and ERβ, which function as ligandactivated nuclear transcription factors producing genomic
effects [15]. ERs are expressed in different cell types
including immune cells [18-21] and the presence of one
ER subtype over the other may change estrogen effects,
promoting or dampening inflammation [15].
ERβ is the predominant ER subtype in colon tissue,
where it plays a fundamental role in growth, organization
and maintenance of normal epithelial architecture [12, 22,
23]. Interestingly, reduced ERβ mRNA expression and
increased gut permeability were found to precede the onset
of colitis in mouse models of intestinal inflammation [12].
Additionally, ERβ knockout mice developed a clinically
more severe colitis as compared to wild-type littermates
[13]. In keeping with these findings, beneficial effects of
ERβ agonists as well as estrogens have been reported in
different models of chronic colitis [9-11, 14]. There is also
evidence that estrogens can modulate disease severity in
IBD patients [4-6]. However, ER expression in human
IBD and its possible correlation with disease activity
have been till now poorly investigated, with the exception
of one study by Looijer-van Langen et al. [12] showing
decreased ERβ mRNA levels in colonic biopsies from
CD patients in relapse, but not in remission. Notably, UC
and CD are associated with an increased risk of colorectal
cancer (CRC) that appears to increase with the duration,
severity and anatomic extent of colonic inflammation
[24, 25]. In this respect, growing data support a role for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

estrogen/ER in the initiation and progression of CRC, and
establish that protective effects of estrogen are exerted
through ERβ [26-28].
In this study we report IBD-associated alterations
of ER expression profile both in peripheral blood T
lymphocytes and in colonic mucosa and their relationship
with the clinical characteristics of the studied population.
We also identified interleukin (IL)-6 as an unrecognized
regulator of ER expression in circulating T cells and
intestinal epithelium.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
ERβ expression is downregulated in peripheral
blood T lymphocytes from active IBD patients
We evaluated by flow cytometry the intracellular
expression of ERα and ERβ in peripheral blood T
lymphocytes from 48 patients with IBD (CD, n = 26 and
UC, n = 22) and 29 age/sex matched healthy controls
(HC). The demographic and clinical characteristics of IBD
patients are summarized in Table 1. A significant increase
of ERα and a concomitant decrease of ERβ expression
were observed in T lymphocytes from IBD patients as
compared to HC, whereas no differences were detected
between CD and UC patients (Figure 1A and 1B). Similar
results were obtained when purified CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells were analyzed separately (data not shown). For both
ERα and ERβ expression, no significant associations
were found with the epidemiological data (sex, age) of
the patient population. To estimate whether ER expression
level reflects disease activity, the patient population was
divided into 2 groups according to the endoscopic activity
at the time of sampling, i.e., patients with active disease
and those in remission (see Materials and Methods and
Table 1 for details). Although ERα expression was not
significantly different in T cells from patients in remission
and those with active disease (Figure 1C), a significantly
lower expression of ERβ was found in T cells from CD/
40444

UC patients with active disease as compared to those in
remission (Figure 1D).
Although ERs have been shown to finely regulate
inflammation [15], this is the first demonstration of a
specific alteration of ER profile in IBD. The current
diagnosis and management of IBD is based on clinical
and endoscopic criteria [29]. More specifically, as routine
clinical assessment is often inaccurate with respect to
endoscopic activity [30], colonoscopy represents the gold
standard technique for the evaluation of disease severity.
However, due to the complexity and invasiveness of this
practice, there is a pressing need for new non-invasive
biomarkers to improve disease activity detection, in
order to better determine prognosis and to monitor drug
response. In this regard, the strong association between

lymphocyte ERβ levels and endoscopic disease activity
observed in our study points to this receptor as a potential
prognostic biomarker for IBD.
Interestingly, blood T lymphocytes from a
subgroup of CD/UC patients in ongoing treatment with
anti-TNF-α (infliximab or adalimumab: 12/26 CD and
7/22 UC) showed significantly different expression of
ERβ according to drug response, as monitored by the
endoscopic activity. Specifically, responsive patients
(n = 8) expressed higher levels of ERβ as compared
to unresponsive patients (n = 11) (Figure 1E). The
expression of ERα was found to be not significantly
different between these 2 groups of patients (Figure 1F).
As response to therapy has been established on the basis
of disease remission at the endoscopic level, our findings

further strengthen the role of T cell-associated ERβ as a
systemic marker of intestinal disease activity. Additionally,
the association found between anti-TNF-α response and
normal ERβ levels in blood T lymphocytes suggests
that ERβ may represent a candidate predictive marker
to assess responsiveness to biological therapy. However,
longitudinal studies including subjects analyzed before
and after the initiation of anti-TNF-α therapy are needed
to provide conclusive evidence for a strict association
between anti-TNF-α response and ERβ rescue.

CD/UC patients and 10 age/sex matched HC. As shown in
Figure 2A, ERβ was highly expressed in normal colonic
mucosa, where a positive staining could be observed in
both epithelial cells and lamina propria lymphocytes.
Interestingly, a consistent reduction of ERβ expression
was found in intestinal mucosa from CD/UC subjects with
active disease (Figure 2B and 2C) but not from those in
remission (Figure 2E and 2F). In particular, a reduction
of both epithelial cell- and lymphocyte-associated ERβ
levels could be appreciated in inflamed mucosa (Figure
2B and 2C). Consistent with previous reports [26, 31, 32],
neoplastic mucosa explanted from patients with colon
adenocarcinoma (n = 5) displayed very low levels of ERβ
expression (Figure 2D).
These results provide the first evidence that, in
human colon, ERβ is markedly reduced in both CD and
UC patients and the extent of its expression reflects disease
activity. Of note, ERβ down-regulation in the colon tissue
parallels that observed in blood T lymphocytes, further
strengthening the role of T cell-associated ERβ as a
systemic marker of intestinal disease activity. Moreover,
the finding that colonic ERβ expression inversely

ERβ dysregulation in peripheral blood reflects
that observed in intestinal mucosa
It has been previously shown that the accumulation
of ERβ transcripts is decreased in intestinal mucosa
samples from IBD patients as compared to controls [12].
To assess the expression of ERβ protein in intestinal
mucosa of IBD patients and to evaluate whether this
expression reflects that observed in the blood, ERβ was
also analyzed in whole colonic mucosa from 19 out of 48

correlates with cancer development/progression [26, 31,
32], together with our results, point to ERβ as a major
regulator of intestinal epithelium integrity also in the
human system and suggest a role for this receptor in
maintaining homeostasis. Of note, IBD represent a risk
factor for CRC development [24, 25], and inflammationassociated early ERβ down-regulation might be one of the
factors linking chronic intestinal diseases to neoplastic

transformation.

IL-6 plasma levels inversely correlate with ERβ
expression and exogenous exposure of both
lymphocytes and intestinal epithelial cells to
recombinant IL-6 results in ERβ downregulation

suggesting that the inflammatory microenvironment of
IBD patients plays a role in controlling the ERα/ERβ
balance. In keeping with this hypothesis, the potential of
IL-6 targeting as a therapeutic strategy in IBD is under
investigation [35].
A deeper characterization of factors and mechanisms
controlling ER expression and function may increase our
knowledge on the pathogenesis of IBD and open new
perspectives for the comprehension and management of
the disease. Further analysis using ERα and ERβ selective
agonists will allow to more deeply investigate the ERmediated responses elicited in chronic inflammatory
conditions, and to study the potential role of ER as
therapeutic target. Reliable biomarkers of disease activity
as well as of response to therapy are not yet available in
IBD. Thus, identifying new factors/mechanisms that are
dysregulated in IBD patients may open new perspectives
for the comprehension of disease pathogenesis and
clinical management. Overall, our results indicate that a
better understanding of the role of ERs may advance our
knowledge of these complex diseases, and lead to novel
therapeutic options.

The unbalanced expression of ERα and ERβ,
exhibiting pro- versus anti-inflammatory features,
respectively, suggests that a switch toward ER-mediated
inflammatory responses occurs in CD/UC patients.
Whether the alterations of ER and ER-induced responses
contribute to establish or are a consequence of the
chronic inflammatory process observed in these subjects
is currently unknown. The finding that a similar ER
regulation occurred in both CD and UC, which exhibit
different localization, endoscopic findings and histological
features, would support the latter hypothesis.
The analysis of soluble immune mediators in plasma
samples from CD/UC patients revealed significantly higher
levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and
IFN-γ in subjects with active disease as compared to those
in remission (Figure 3A-3C). Interestingly, a significant
inverse correlation was found between ERβ expression
and plasma levels of IL-6 (Figure 3D) but not those of
TNF-α and IFN-γ (R = -0.10, p = 0.58, and R = -0.07, p
= 0.69, respectively, data not shown). No correlation was
found between ERα expression and plasma cytokine levels
(data not shown).
Based on these results, the effect of exogenous
administration of IL-6 on ERβ expression was
investigated. As shown in Figure 3E, exposure of control
blood T lymphocytes to IL-6 significantly reduced ERβ
expression, whereas TNF-α and IFN-γ did not exert any
effect. Conversely, ERα levels were not significantly
modulated by these cytokines (data not shown). To assess
whether intestinal ERβ expression could be regulated as a
result of inflammatory cytokine stimulation, Caco-2 cellderived normal epithelium was exposed to IL-6 at either
apical or basolateral sides. Consistent with the results
obtained in T cells, IL-6 was found to downregulate ERβ
expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Notably, this effect
was observed when IL-6 was added to the basolateral but
not to the apical side (Figure 3F and 3G), thus resembling
the cross-talk between intestinal epithelium and lamina
propria immune cells occurring in vivo [33].
Although the mechanism(s) underlying ERβ
regulation remain to be further elucidated, our results
show that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6,
whose levels we found increased in serum from IBD
patients with active disease, contributes to regulate ER
expression in T lymphocytes and in in vitro-generated
intestinal epithelium. IL-6 has been recently reported to
negatively regulate ERβ expression in ovarian cancer
cell lines [34]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first demonstration that this cytokine can regulate ERβ
expression in intestinal epithelium and blood T cells,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authors’
institutional review board. All the subjects included were
provided with complete information about the study and
asked to sign an informed consent.

Patients and biological samples
Biological samples were obtained from patients with
documented CD (n = 26) or UC (n = 22) attending to the
Digestive Endoscopy Unit (Catholic University, Rome,
Italy), the Gastroenterology and Digestive Endoscopy
(Nuovo Regina Margherita Hospital, Rome, Italy), and
the IBD Unit (Complesso Integrato Columbus, Catholic
University, Rome, Italy). Endoscopic biopsies from 5
patients with colon adenocarcinoma were obtained from
the Histopathology Complex Unit (Santo Spirito Hospital,
Rome, Italy). Twenty-nine healthy controls (HC) matched
for age and sex made up a control group. The exclusion
criteria were: clinical evidence of active infection, recent
(within 14 days) use of antibiotics, pregnancy, hormonebased therapy, and treatment with corticosteroids
(methylprednisolone or equivalents ) at doses > 20 mg/day.
Patients undergoing anti-TNF-α therapy were analyzed
after at least 6 months from the initiation of therapy and
40448

blood ER expression was determined the week before the
next anti-TNF-α administration. Endoscopic results were
assessed according to the Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic
Index of Severity (CDEIS, remission when score < 3)
[36] for CD, the Rutgeerts score (remission when score =
i0) [37] for post-operative CD, and the Mayo endoscopic
sub-score (remission when score = 0) [38] for UC. Blood
samples were drawn at the time of obtaining peripheral
vein access for the endoscopic procedure. Plasma were
frozen soon after collection and stored at -80°C until used.
Endoscopic biopsies were taken from colon/ileum tissue
of IBD patients, whereas surgical specimens of colonic
mucosa, from both neoplastic and adjacent ( > 5 cm distal)
macroscopically non-neoplastic regions, were obtained
from subjects with colon adenocarcinoma. Intestinal
mucosa was fixed in 10% formalin and stored for further
processing.

protein-conjugated anti-CD8 monoclonal Abs (all from
BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) were also used to
identify ERα and ERβ expression in lymphocyte subsets.
Acquisition was performed on a FACSCalibur cytometer
(BD Biosciences) and 50,000 events per sample were
run. Data were analyzed using the Cell Quest Pro (BD
Biosciences) software.

Quantification of plasma cytokine/chemokine
levels
The analysis of cytokine content in plasma samples
of randomly selected HC and IBD patients was performed
by using the Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27-plex Assay
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. This assay was able to
concomitantly detect the following cytokines, chemokines
and growth factors: IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL17, Basic FGF, Eotaxin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IP-10,
MCP-1 (MCAF), MIP-1α, MIP-1β, PDGF-BB, RANTES,
TNF-α, VEGF. The assay was performed at the Facility
for Complex Protein Mixture (CPM) Analysis (Istituto
Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy).

Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
and cell culture conditions
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated
by Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation.
Untouched T cells were subsequently separated using the
Pan T Cell isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotec, BergischGladbach, Germany). The purity of recovered cells,
assessed by flow cytometer, was ≥ 97%. For ER analysis,
cells were processed soon after isolation. For cytokine
stimulation, T cells isolated from HC were seeded in
RPMI-1640 medium without phenol red (GIBCO BRL,
Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% charcoalstripped fetal bovine serum (FBS, Euroclone, Pero, Milan,
Italy), 2mM glutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) 50
μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma), and exposed for 72 hours to
IL-6 or TNF-α (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA; 50 ng/
ml) or IFN-γ (Peprotech, 500 IU/ml) before ER analysis.
The 72 hour time point as well as the concentrations used
were chosen on the basis of preliminary time course and
dose-response experiments showing that these conditions
were those at which the highest changes of ER expression
could be detected.

Immunohistochemistry analysis
Intestinal mucosa sections were mounted on to
superfrost microscope slides and immunostaining of ERβ
was performed. Mouse anti-human ERβ Ab (clone 14C8,
Abcam) was applied at a dilution of 1:200 for 60 minutes
at 37°C. Antigen retrieval was performed with Cell
Conditioning (CC1, Ventana Medical Systems, Illkirch,
France) for 60 minutes at 98°C. The Ab reactions were
revealed using the ultraView Universal DAB (Ventana
Medical Systems). ERβ staining of neoplastic mucosa
from subjects with colon adenocarcinoma was also
performed, whereas adjacent normal mucosa ( > 5 cm
distal from the neoplastic lesion) was used as a positive
control. Sections incubated after the omission of the
primary Ab were used as negative controls. The sections
were counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated and
mounted on glass coverslips. All samples were observed
and photographed with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope.

Flow cytometry
Intracellular phenotyping of T cells was performed
by flow cytometry as previously described [21]. FITCconjugated rabbit anti-human ERα antibody (Ab, clone
MC-20) or mouse anti-human ERβ (clone 1531) Ab, both
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
were used. Equal amounts of appropriate isotype controls
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Anti-human
ERβ Ab was visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated F(ab’)2 fragment secondary Ab (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). Allophycocyanin conjugated anti-CD3,

and lysed in RIPA buffer. Intracellular ERβ expression
analysis was performed by western blot as previously
described [21], using a mouse anti-human ERβ Ab (clone
