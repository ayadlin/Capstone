NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is the most common type of pediatric peripheral T-cell
lymphoma. In 70–80% of cases, the chromosomal aberration t(2;5)(p23;q35) results in the
juxtaposition of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with nucleophosmin (NPM) and the
subsequent expression of the NPM-ALK fusion protein. NPM-ALK is a chimeric tyrosine kinase,
which induces numerous signaling pathways that drive proliferation and abrogate apoptosis.
However, the mechanisms that lead to activation of downstream growth regulatory molecules have
not been completely elucidated. Using a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic screen, we
identified GSK3β as a signaling mediator of NPM-ALK. Using a selective inhibitor of ALK, we
demonstrated that the tyrosine kinase activity of ALK regulates the serine-9 phosphorylation of
GSK3β. Expression of NPM-ALK in 293T cells led to an increase of pS9-GSK3β (glycogen
synthase kinase 3 beta) compared with kinase-defective K210R mutant NPM-ALK, but did not
affect total GSK3β levels. Phosphorylation of pS9-GSK3β by NPM-ALK was mediated by the
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. ALK inhibition resulted in degradation of GSK3β substrates Mcl-1
and CDC25A, which was recovered upon chemical inhibition of the proteasome (MG132).
Furthermore, the degradation of Mcl-1 was recoverable with inhibition of GSK3β. ALK inhibition
also resulted in decreased cell viability, which was rescued by GSK3β inhibition. Furthermore,
stable knockdown of GSK3β conferred resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of ALK
inhibition using viability and colony formation assays. pS9-GSK3β and CDC25A were selectively
expressed in neoplastic cells of ALK + ALCL tissue biopsies, and showed a significant correlation
(P < 0.001). Conversely, ALK-ALCL tissue biopsies did not show significant correlation of pS9GSK3β and CDC25A expression (P < 0.2). Our results demonstrate that NPM-ALK regulates the
phosphorylation of S9-GSK3β by PI3K/AKT. The subsequent inhibition of GSK3β activity results

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
often characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35). This translocation
results in the expression of the nucleo-phosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK)
fusion protein (Morris et al., 1994). Although the expression of ALK is usually confined to
neonatal brain tissue (Iwahara et al., 1997), the translocation places the gene under the
regulation of the NPM promoter, which is abundantly and ubiquitously expressed.
Furthermore, the dimerization of the fusion protein mediated by the oligomerization domain
of NPM (Bischof et al., 1997) leads to its autophosphorylation and constitutive activation
(Amin and Lai, 2007; Palmer et al., 2009). NPM-ALK activates diverse growth factor
signaling pathways including the JAK/STAT (Zamo et al., 2002), the PI3K/AKT (Slupianek
et al., 2001) and the PLCγ pathways (Bai et al., 1998). However, the cellular mechanisms
utilized by NPM-ALK to induce oncogenesis have not been completely characterized.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To identify novel signaling proteins regulated by NPM-ALK, we carried out
phosphoproteomic studies of t(2;5) + cell lines using the approach outlined previously (Rush
et al., 2005). Our studies provide evidence that GSK3β is a novel NPM-ALK-regulated
protein. GSK3β is a serine/threonine kinase that is constitutively active in resting cells
(Cohen and Frame, 2001; Jope and Johnson, 2004). Upon growth factor signaling, GSK3β is
phosphorylated at serine-9, which inhibits its ability to target key substrates for proteasomal
degradation. The accumulation of substrates of GSK3β such as CDC25A and Mcl-1 that
regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis contributes to the enhanced proliferative capacity of
tumor cells (Jinno et al., 1994; Diehl et al., 1997; Zhao et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2008).
Here, we show that serine-9 phosphorylation of GSK3β is dependent on NPM-ALK kinase
activity and the PI3K/AKT pathway. We provide evidence that NPM-ALK results in
stabilization of Mcl-1 and CDC25A through GSK3β inhibition, which in turn enhances cell
viability, proliferation and oncogenic potential. Furthermore, tissue biopsies of ALK +
ALCLs express pS9-glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) as well as CDC25A,
providing additional support for its functional significance in ALK + ALCLs.

Results and discussion
Given the oncogenic role of constitutively active NPM-ALK tyrosine kinase in ALK +
ALCL, we hypothesized that NPM-ALK-expressing cell lines would exhibit a
phosphoproteomic signature that would reflect the signaling cascade regulated by the
oncogene. To gain insight into these signaling pathways and to identify novel regulators of
NPM-ALK-induced oncogenesis, we used a phosphoproteomic approach (Rush et al., 2005)

to evaluate the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in the NPM-ALK-expressing SUPM2 cell
line. SUPM2 cell lysates were subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment using
phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies, followed by tandem mass spectrometry. NPM-ALKderived phosphotyrosine peptides in addition to numerous other phosphorylated proteins
were identified (data not shown). Among this list was an eleven amino-acid tryptic peptide
corresponding to GSK3β protein phosphorylated at Y216 (Figures 1a and b). Of note, this
phosphotyrosine peptide has been identified in a similar study contributing to the confidence
of this candidate protein (Boccalatte et al., 2009). On the basis of the known role of GSK3β
in cellular signaling (Jope and Johnson, 2004), we hypothesized that GSK3β may mediate
the oncogenic properties of NPM-ALK. As GSK3β activity is known to be regulated by
growth factor signaling through serine9 phosphorylation, we hypothesized that NPM-ALK
regulates the serine phosphorylation of GSK3β and inhibits its activity.

In order to determine whether serine phosphorylation of GSK3β is NPM-ALK dependent,
we utilized a small molecule (Compound 15) to inhibit ALK kinase (Ott et al., 2010).
Treatment of SU-DHL-1 cells with the ALK inhibitor for 2 and 6 h resulted in a marked
decrease in the levels of phosphorylated NPM-ALK (Y1604), but not total NPM-ALK
(Figure 1c). There was a marked decrease of pS9-GSK3β in both a dose-and time-dependent
manner, whereas total GSK3β levels remained unaffected. After 6 h of 300 nM ALK
inhibitor treatment, only 34%-of the serine phosphorylated GSK3β remained. Three
additional ALCL-derived cell lines (DEL, Karpas 299 and SUPM2) were treated with 300
nM ALK inhibitor for 6 h (Figure 1d), and similar to the effect observed in SU-DHL-1 cells
pS9-GSK3β was consistently reduced by ALK inhibition in all of the cell lines. Notably, in
contrast to the marked decrease in ALK phosphorylation, the decrease in pS9-GSK3β was
not complete. This may be partially explained by the existence of other kinases that
phosphorylate GSK3β independent of NPM-ALK. Alternatively, the time points used may
not be representative of the maximal loss of pS9-GSK3β. In addition, protein phosphatases
that regulate pS9-GSK3β may be weakly active in the context of NPM-ALK. Similarly,
293T cells that were transiently transfected with vectors encoding the kinase-defective
mutant (K210R) showed a 76% reduction in GSK3β serine phosphorylation, compared with
those that expressed the wild-type NPM-ALK (Figure 1e). Consistent with the previous
observation, there was no effect on expression of total GSK3β protein levels. Next, we
evaluated the effect of ALK knockdown using stable tetracycline-inducible small hairpin
RNA (shRNA) targeting NPM-ALK in SU-DHL-1 cells (Ito et al., 2010). Successful
knockdown of NPM-ALK, which was observed after 4 days of tetracycline treatment, led to
a marked decrease (79%) in pS9-GSK3β (Figure 1f), whereas the total GSK3β protein levels
remained unchanged. These data demonstrate that NPM-ALK kinase activity is required for
the serine-9 phosphorylation of GSK3β.
Interrogation of the phosphoproteomic data identified several serine kinases that are known
to phosphorylate GSK3β (data not shown). These included the PI3K, PKC and PKA kinases.
As the PI3K/AKT pathway is known to be activated by NPM-ALK as well as responsible
for GSK3β serine phosphorylation (Cross et al., 1995; Slupianek et al., 2001), we
hypothesized that the regulation of pS9-GSK3β by NPM-ALK is mediated by PI3K/AKT.
We utilized a selective small molecule inhibitor against PI3K-δ (CAL-101) (Herman et al.,

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 November 26.

2010) to determine the effect of PI3K/AKT inhibition on pS9-GSK3β in SU-DHL-1 cells.
Exposure to CAL-101 for 24 h at increasing concentrations resulted in decreased
phosphorylation of pS9-GSK3β and pS473-AKT in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2a).
Importantly, p-ALK was not affected by CAL-101-mediated inhibition of PI3K/AKT. These
data show that the PI3K/AKT pathway mediates the serine9 GSK3β phosphorylation by
NPM-ALK. However, this doesn’t preclude the possibility that other pathways active in
such as WNT (van Noort et al., 2002) or PLCγ (Bai et al., 1998) also contribute to GSK3β
phosphorylation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The serine9 phosphorylation of GSK3β results in inhibition of its kinase activity (Frame et
al., 2001). As active GSK3β is known to target a variety of proteins for proteasomal
degradation, we hypothesized that two known substrates of GSK3β, CDC25A and Mcl-1
would be deregulated in ALCL cells. We evaluated the expression of CDC25A in SUDHL-1 cells after the inhibition of ALK at indicated time points, following release from
double thymidine block synchronization (Bostock et al., 1971) (Figure 2b). ALK inhibition
resulted in significant reduction of CDC25A levels in a time-dependent manner, with only
30% of the protein remaining after 8 h. In contrast, CDC25A expression remained
unchanged through the entire 8 h time period in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control
condition. These data suggest that NPM-ALK deregulates the normal cyclical expression of
CDC25A and leads to stabilization and enhanced expression throughout the cell cycle (Jinno
et al., 1994). Similarly, the expression of Mcl-1 and CDC25A were analyzed in SU-DHL-1
cells in the presence of ALK inhibitor and/or proteasome inhibitor (MG132) after release
from synchronization using double thymidine block. As shown in Figure 2c, inhibition of
ALK resulted in a significant downregulation of Mcl-1 (47% of control) and CDC25A (14%
of control), which was recoverable by simultaneous inhibition of the proteasome. These data
suggest that NPM-ALK activity enhances the stability of Mcl-1 and CDC25A. Interestingly,
MG132 treatment resulted in recovery of Mcl-1 and CDC25A levels that exceeded the
expression in the DMSO control (120% and 358%, respectively), suggesting that NPM-ALK
does not provide complete proteasomal protection for these proteins.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine the role of GSK3β in proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1, SU-DHL-1 cells were
treated with the ALK inhibitor and/or a GSK3 inhibitor (inhibitor IX) for 6 h. As shown in
Figure 2d, the decrease in Mcl-1 upon ALK inhibition was abrogated by GSK3 inhibition.
Thus, NPM-ALK-mediated inhibition of GSK3β results in protection of Mcl-1 from
proteasomal degradation. These data provide evidence for the role of GSK3β in enhancing
the stability of Mcl-1 in NPM-ALK-expressing cells. As Mcl-1 is a known antiapoptotic
protein (Maurer et al., 2006), we asked whether NPM-ALK confers resistance to apoptosis
by its inhibition of GSK3β. Western blot analyses were performed on SU-DHL-1 and
SUPM2 cell lysates to evaluate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage as a
surrogate marker for apoptosis (Boulares et al., 1999). Cells treated with the GSK3β
inhibitor IX alone resulted in no change in PARP cleavage, whereas ALK inhibition greatly
reduced ALK phosphorylation and increased the cleavage of PARP (Figure 2e).
Interestingly, when both enzymes were inhibited, PARP cleavage was significantly reduced
compared with the ALK inhibitor alone. These data indicate that NPM-ALK leads to
inhibition of GSK3β, which provide protection against apoptosis.

To determine whether GSK3β is a key mediator of NPM-ALK-induced oncogenesis, we
assessed the effect of inhibitor IX on the cell viability of two ALCL-derived cell lines. An
effective dose of 100 nM of Inhibitor IX was selected because it represents a concentration
well above the IC50 (inhibitory concentration) for GSK3β but below the IC50 for other
serine/threonine kinases (Meijer et al., 2003). As expected, the ALK inhibitor (100 nM)
resulted in a dramatic reduction of cell viability as determined by WST-1 (4-[3-(4iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate) assay (Figure 3a)
to approximately 35% of control in both cell lines. Treatment of ALCL-derived cell lines,
SU-DHL-1 and SUPM2 with the GSK3β Inhibitor IX (100 nM) did not affect viability after
24 h. Notably, exposure to both compounds simultaneously (dual) resulted in a viability of
55% and 47% compared with control in SU-DHL-1 and SUPM2 cells, respectively. This
represents a significant recovery of viability compared with ALK inhibition (P < 0.01).
Importantly, Jurkat cells (ALK-negative T-lymphoblastic leukemia) were not responsive to
either the inhibitor IX or the ALK inhibitor, and there was no recovery in cellular viability.
To corroborate the results of ALK and GSK3β inhibition on cell proliferation, we carried out
flow cytometry-based Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining to quantitatively assess
cell viability (Figure 3b). Similar to the results of the WST-1 assay, inhibition of NPM-ALK
resulted in a drastic reduction (80%) in the percentage of live (Annexin V and PI negative)
cells compared with the DMSO control. Treatment with the GSK3β inhibitor alone did not
have an effect on the percentage of live cells. However, inhibition of both GSK3β and NPMALK (dual) resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of live cells compared with
ALK inhibition alone (34%).
To address the role of GSK3β in oncogenic potential of ALCL cells, Karpas 299 cells were
treated with the ALK inhibitor and inhibitor IX for 6 h before seeding into methylcellulose
media. After 14 days, colonies were stained and enumerated (Figure 3c). Whereas inhibition
of ALK led to a significant reduction of the number of colonies compared with control
(51%), dual inhibition of both GSK3β and ALK caused a recovery in the number of colonies
(79% compared with DMSO). We verified that 6 h pre-treatment did not affect viability
before seeding into the methylcellulose media by trypan blue staining. This showed that the
same number of viable cells was used for all conditions that were evaluated (Figure 3d).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further evaluate the role of GSK3β in NPM-ALK-mediated oncogenesis, stable GSK3β
knockdown cell lines were created by lentiviral transfection of shRNA targeted against
GSK3β (Figure 3e) in two ALCL-derived cell lines. SU-DHL-1 and Karpas 299 cells stably
expressing scramble or shGSK3β vectors were subjected to WST-1 assay following
treatment with the ALK inhibitor (Figure 3f). Both cell lines expressing scramble shRNA
showed a decrease in viability upon ALK inhibition. In contrast, the cells with knockdown
of GSK3β (shGSK3β) were resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of ALK inhibition.
Similarly, cells expressing scramble shRNA displayed a signification reduction in number of
colonies following ALK inhibition, whereas those with knockdown of GSK3β (shGSK3β)
were resistant to ALK inhibition and showed more colonies (Figure 3g). These data support
the hypothesis that NPM-ALK-mediated phosphorylation of GSK3β promotes proliferation
and oncogenic transformation. It is of interest to note that the rescue mediated by inhibition
of GSK3β was not complete This may be because of the presence of several GSK3β-

independent signaling pathways that are regulated by NPM-ALK such as JAK/STAT or
ERK (Ruchatz et al., 2003; Marzec et al., 2006; Lim et al., 2009). This idea is also evident
in the observation that pS9-GSK3β was not completely abolished by ALK inhibition (Figure
1c), yet a dramatic decrease in cell viability was observed.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 16 ALK-positive ALCL (ALK + ALCL)
tissue biopsies and 16 ALK-negative ALCL (ALK-ALCL) tissue biopsies. ALK + ALCL
samples showed strong staining for ALK in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of neoplastic
cells (Figure 4a), whereas ALK-ALCL samples showed no expression of ALK (Figure 4e).
A total of 14 of the 16 ALK + ALCL samples showed strong expression of pS9-GSK3β in
the neoplastic cells with weak expression in adjacent endothelial cells (Figures 4b and d).
Additionally, 13 out of 16 ALK + ALCL cases also showed expression of CDC25A,
highlighting the nuclear membranes of the neoplastic cells (Figure 4c). Reactive
lymphocytes did not express significant levels of pS9-GSK3β (Figure 4b) or CDC25A
(Figure 4c). Using χ-squared-squared distribution to test whether the observed distribution is
statistically different from the expected randomized distribution, we found that the ALK +
ALCL cases displayed a significant correlation of pS9-GSK3β and CDC25A expression (P <
0.001) (Figure 4d). In contrast, only 5 out of 16 of the ALK-ALCL cases showed expression
of pS9-GSK3β in the neoplastic cells whereas the infiltrating neutrophils showed strong
expression (Figures 4f and h). CDC25A expression in ALK-ALCL was present in 11 out of
16 cases. Figure 4g shows a representative case of ALK-ALCL lacking CDC25A
expression. In contrast to the ALK + ALCL cases, the ALK-ALCL cases displayed a lack of
significant correlation of pS9-GSK3β and CDC25A expression distribution (P < 0.2) (Figure
4h). Reactive tonsillar tissues demonstrated weak expression of pS9-GSK3β in epithelial
cells and scattered interfollicular activated T-lymphocytes (Figure 4i). CDC25A expression
was strongly expressed in the epithelial cells and in scattered interfollicular activated Tlymphocytes (Figure 4j). These findings confirm the presence of the inhibited form of
GSK3β and the accumulation of one of its downstream substrates in human ALCL tumor
samples. Overexpression of CDC25A transcript has been observed in various lymphomas
including ALK + ALCLs (Fernandez-Vidal et al., 2009), however its expression in ALCL
tumor tissue samples using IHC has not been reported previously.

In conclusion, our data show that NPM-ALK regulates the inhibitory serine phosphorylation
of GSK3β in ALCL cells, providing a growth advantage and the maintenance of a
proliferative phenotype. Our studies uncover a novel mechanism of NPM-ALK-mediated
oncogenesis. Detailed elucidation of such deregulated signaling events may be exploited in
the design of targeted and combinatorial therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ALKdriven neoplasia.
