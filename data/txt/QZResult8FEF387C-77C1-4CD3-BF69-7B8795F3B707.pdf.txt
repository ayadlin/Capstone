BACKGROUND: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using break-apart red (30 ) and green (50 ) ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) probes, consistently shows rearrangements in <100% of tumor cells in ALK-positive (ALKþ) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Increased copy numbers of fused and rearranged signals also occur. Here, correlations are explored between the percentage of ALKþ
cells and signal copy number and their association with response to ALK inhibition. METHODS: Ninety ALKþ NSCLC cases were evaluated. The percentage of positive cells, pattern of positivity (split, single red, or both), and copy number of fused, isolated red and
green signals were recorded. Thirty patients had received crizotinib. RESULTS: Increased isolated red signal copy number (contributing to both single red and split patterns of positivity) correlated with a higher percentage of ALKþ cells (r ¼ 0.743, P < .0001). Mean
fused copy number was negatively associated with isolated red signal copy number (r ¼ 0.409, P < .0001). Neither percentage of
positive cells (r ¼ 0.192, P ¼ .3), nor copy number of isolated red signal (r ¼ 0.274, P ¼ .195) correlated with maximal tumor shrinkage
with crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: The strong association between increased copy number of key ALK signals and percentage of positive
cells suggests that the <100% rate of cellular positivity in ALKþ tumors is due to technical factors, not biological factors. In ALKþ
tumors, neither the percentage of positive cells nor signal copy number appear to be informative variables for predicting benefit from
ALK inhibition. The inverse relationship between fused and isolated red copy number suggests ALKþ may be a distinct ‘‘near-diploid’’

Activation of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been described as a primary oncogenic event in a number of different
human cancers.1 In most cases, activation is through a chromosomal rearrangement that places one of several different 50
fusion partners and their associated promoter upstream of the 30 kinase domain of ALK.2 Rearrangements of the ALK gene
occur in 3% to 5% of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), most notably in adenocarcinomas.1 The most common 50
fusion partner in NSCLC is EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4), but other, rarer 50 fusion partners, notably KIF5B (kinesin family member 5B) and TFG (TRK-fused gene), have also been described.3-5 There are various potential methods for detecting ALK positivity in solid tumors, including use of immunohistochemistry to look for
aberrant expression of the kinase domain, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with primers directed
against specific fusion pairings and use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with break-apart probes that bind 50
and 30 of the common breakpoint in ALK to look directly for a gene rearrangement.1,6
NSCLC patients proven to have an ALK gene rearrangement, with FISH as the screening technique, commonly
manifest rapid, dramatic, and prolonged responses to crizotinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of ALK and MET.7,8 Within
all of the crizotinib studies, ALK positivity as determined by FISH has been defined as >15% of tumor nuclei demonstrating either split and/or single 30 (red in the most commonly used probe-color pairing) fluorescence patterns.7,8 To count as
positive for a rearrangement with a split pattern, splitting of the 50 (green) and 30 (red) signals must occur by more than 2
signal diameters. Single 50 (green) patterns and increased copy numbers of native (fused) and rearranged signals have also

been reported, but their biological significance, beyond
simply reflecting the chromosomal instability of many
cancers, remains uncertain.9,10
We have previously shown that the proportion of
positive cells within an overall ALK-positive (ALKþ) tumor covers a broad range greater than 15% but below
100% (eg, 22%-87%).9 Although some have interpreted
such findings as evidence against ALK gene rearrangements being both a primary and/or necessary oncogenic
event in NSCLC, other explanations exist.11 In conjunction with the presence of positive signals in up to 11% of
nontumor and negative tumor cells, we hypothesized that
most of the variation above zero in the negative and nontumor areas and the variation below 100% in the positive
tumor areas reflected technique rather than biology.9 Specifically, individual cells may be counted as positive but
not possess a true rearrangement (false positives) or may
be counted as negative when they do in fact possess a rearrangement (false negatives).
If cellular heterogeneity is related to technique and
not to biology, we hypothesized that the following would
be true. First, because a single red pattern may be easier to
detect than a split pattern, the overall proportion of
ALKþ cells should be higher in tumors expressing the single red pattern of positivity than the split pattern. Second,
it should be harder to miss a true positive pattern when
the number of signal copies is increased, given that only
one split red/green or single red pattern per cell is required
to call a cell positive, and therefore there should be a positive correlation between the number of 30 (red) signals
(contributing to both single red and split patterns of positivity) and the percentage of ALKþ cells in an ALKþ tumor. In contrast, fused signal copy number should not be
associated with the proportion of ALKþ cells. Because the
50 (green) signal contributes to both positive (split) and
negative (single green) patterns, correlation with ALKþ
may not be apparent for the overall 50 signal copy number,
but should be obvious when only those cases with a split
pattern of positivity are analyzed. Finally, there should be
no correlation between the percentage of ALKþ cells present in any ALKþ tumor and the maximal percentage of
tumor shrinkage, as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), seen in that tumor after
therapy with crizotinib. To test these hypotheses, as well
as the potential biological significance of ALK copy number alterations in ALKþ tumors, we explored correlations
between the percentage of ALKþ cells, patterns of ALK
positivity, and signal copy number and whether these variables are associated with response to ALK inhibition in
ALKþ NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The University of Colorado Thoracic Oncology Program
performs routine molecular screening for multiple molecular abnormalities including EGFR (epidermal growth
factor receptor) and KRAS (v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma
viral oncogene homolog) mutations and ALK gene rearrangements on all NSCLC cases with available tumor tissue. Testing is performed in-house within the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified
Colorado Molecular Correlates (CMOCO) laboratory
for the purposes of directing patients toward the most
appropriate targeted therapy. Screening for ALK gene
rearrangements by FISH began in late 2008 with the goal
of identifying patients for entry into defined molecular
cohorts within the phase 1 study of crizotinib (PF02341066).7 Initially, only patients with metastatic disease were screened, but later, beyond the crizotinib study,
all patients with NSCLC were screened regardless of stage
from the first point of contact with the program. Testing
for ALK with FISH, using the LSI ALK Dual Color,
Break-Apart Rearrangement Probe (Abbott Molecular),
designed to detect rearrangements in chromosome 2p23
encompassing the ALK gene, was conducted as
described.7,9 This probe set included a 250-kilobase (kb)
DNA fragment telomeric to ALK (30 end) labeled in SpectrumOrange and a 300-kb fragment centromeric to ALK
(50 end) labeled in SpectrumGreen. Signals were enumerated in at least 50 tumor nuclei in standard 4- to 5-lm
thick sections, using an epifluorescence microscope with
single interference filters sets for green (fluorescein isothiocyanate), red (Texas red), and blue (40 ,6-diamidino2-phenylindole) as well as dual (red/green) and triple
(blue, red, green) band-pass filters. Tumor areas were
marked by a lung pathologist in a hematoxylin-and-eosin–stained slide prior to FISH analysis to facilitate the
identification of tumor-rich regions by the FISH technologist. Because the 30 ALK orange probe is detected by an
interference filter with emission/excitation within the red
wavelength, its fluorescence signal is seen as red and identified as a ‘‘red’’ signal in this study.
On FISH testing, the occurrence of an ALK gene
rearrangement was concluded if >15% of tumor cells
showed a split red and green and/or single red (residual 30 )
pattern, otherwise the specimen was classified as ALK
FISH–negative. Tumor specimens from the first 90
ALKþ patients with NSCLC were examined. The percentage of tumor cells positive for a rearrangement, the
pattern of positivity (split, single red or both), and the
copy number of the fused, isolated red and isolated green
signals contributing to these patterns were recorded

A protocol approved by the institutional review
board at the University of Colorado permitted clinical
correlates to be made on all in-house patients in whom
molecular analyses have been conducted within the
CMOCO laboratory. In addition, patients within the crizotinib phase 1 study signed informed consent for treatment and data capture. The protocol for the crizotinib
phase 1 study was approved by the institutional review
board at each institution.
Linear associations between the percentage of ALKþ
cells and signal copy number or response to therapy were
summarized by Spearman correlations using 2-sided P
values. A 2-sided Student t test was performed to compare
the average percentage of ALKþ cells between different
patterns of positivity (split vs single red).
Figure 1. (A) Schematic diagram is shown of the different cellular positive (split or single red) and negative (fused or single green) patterns for ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase)
status testing with fluorescence in situ hybridization testing.
(B) Schematic diagram exhibits how individual fused, isolated
red and isolated green signals are counted and contribute to
the different positive and negative patterns seen.

(Fig. 1A,B). Of note, throughout this article, the term
‘‘signal’’ is used to refer to the individual spot representing
homology to a specific probe sequence, whereas ‘‘pattern’’
is used to refer to how the different signals present in a
given tumor cell. In addition, the term ‘‘single’’ is reserved
for the description of a specific pattern, whereas ‘‘isolated’’
is used in reference to a specific probe signal. For example,
an isolated red signal may be part of a split pattern or a
single red pattern of positivity, depending on whether an
isolated green signal either does or does not coexist in the
same cell.
Of the 90 ALKþ patients, 30 received crizotinib
(PF-02341066) within the phase 1 study and had available response outcomes on therapy.7,8 Best objective
responses of target lesions per RECIST, version 1.0, were
assessed on patients with measurable disease following crizotinib treatment. Radiographic disease assessments were
performed at baseline and continued after every other 28day cycle, or if clinically indicated, until disease progression as determined by the clinic physician. The lowest
sum of the diameter of target lesions at any assessment
while on treatment was calculated against baseline measurements to determine maximum tumor response (percent tumor shrinkage). RECIST response data were then
correlated with the individual’s ALK profile (percent
ALKþ cells, signal pattern, and signal copy number).

RESULTS
Percentage of ALK1 Cells According to
Patterns of Positivity and Correlation With
Signal Copy Number

The mean percentage of ALKþ cells was 56% (range:
18%-100%) in the dataset of 90 ALKþ patients and 59%
(24%-94%) in the subset of 30 crizotinib-treated patients.
In the overall dataset, 49 patients (54%) demonstrated a
split signal pattern of positivity, 33 patients (37%) demonstrated a single red pattern of positivity, and 8 patients
(9%) demonstrated aspects of both patterns (Fig. 1). In
the crizotinib-treated dataset, 18 patients (60%) demonstrated a split signal pattern of positivity, 10 patients
(33%) demonstrated a single red pattern of positivity, and
2 patients (7%) demonstrated aspects of both patterns.
The mean and range of cells positive by pattern of
positivity is shown in Table 1. Tumors with a single red
pattern of positivity had a significantly higher mean percentage of ALKþ cells than tumors with a split pattern of
positivity (74% [26%-100%] vs 48% (18%-82%),
respectively; P < .0001). However, both patterns demonstrated a similarly wide range of percentage positive cells.
The correlations between the percentage of ALKþ
cells, overall and by different patterns of positivity (split,
single red, and mixed), and the mean fused, isolated red
and isolated green signal copy number are shown in Table
1. Increased copy number of isolated red signal (contributing to both single red and split patterns of positivity)
strongly correlated with a higher percentage of cells positive for a rearrangement (r ¼ 0.743, P < .0001) (Fig. 2).
The correlation with isolated red signal copy number gain
was stronger for the single red pattern than for the split
pattern of positivity (r ¼ 0.884, P < .0001 vs r ¼ 0.558,
P < .0001, respectively).

ALKþ indicates positivity for anaplastic lymphoma kinase; FCN, fused copy number; IGCN, isolated green signal copy number; IRCN, isolated red signal copy
number.

Isolated green signal copy number (contributing to
the split pattern of positivity and the single green negative
pattern) was loosely associated with a lower percentage of
cells positive for a rearrangement (negative association
with higher percentage) (r ¼ 0.264, P ¼ .012). However, when only those tumors with a split pattern of positivity were assessed, the correlation between percentage of
positive cells and isolated green signal copy number was
strongly reversed (r ¼ 0.91, P < .0001).
Fused signal copy number was negatively associated
with the percentage of cells positive for a rearrangement (r
¼ 0.466, P < .0001), particularly if the tumor was positive with a split as opposed to a single red pattern of positivity (r ¼ 0.44, P ¼ .002 vs r ¼ 0.042, P ¼ .016).

The correlations between the mean copy number per cell

are shown in Table 2. Although there was no correlation
between mean fused and isolated green signal copy number (all patterns), mean fused copy number was negatively
associated with isolated red signal copy number (r ¼

not specifically associated with ALK positivity per se, contributing as it does to both positive (split) and negative
(single green) patterns, we reanalyzed the correlation

Conclusions

ALK gene rearrangements in NSCLC are highly predictive
of clinical benefit from treatment with crizotinib, a smallmolecule inhibitor of ALK and MET.7 In most cases,
treatment with crizotinib results in tumor shrinkage. The

of crizotinib was 61%, with a median duration of response
of 48 weeks.8 In addition, when the waterfall plot of
RECIST-defined changes in tumor size on treatment is
examined, although not everyone reached the criteria for a
RECIST-defined objective response, nearly 90% of
patients manifested some degree of tumor shrinkage from
the drug.8 Within the phase 1 and other studies of crizotinib in ALKþ NSCLC, ALK positivity is determined using
FISH with the Abbott Molecular break-apart probe set as
the screening technique.
We have previously shown that there is a broad
range of percentage of positive cells within tumors meeting the >15% criterion for positivity.9 Using separate
FISH probes for both EML4 and ALK, Martelli et al similarly noted EML4-ALK rearrangements in 50% to 100%
of cells of their ALKþ tumors.11 Because the presence of
EML4-ALK alone is sufficient to act as a transforming
event, the fact that not all cells in the tumor appear to
demonstrate a gene rearrangement initially seems confusing.3 Based on their findings, Martelli et al concluded that
ALK rearrangements may represent a late, rather than the
primary, oncogenic event, resulting in the coproliferation
of different ALKþ and ALK-negative clones within established tumors.11 The alternative explanation why ALKþ
tumors do not show positivity in all cells is that there is a
consistent cell-by-cell false negative rate. Consistent with
this is the observation that FISH analysis of cell pellets
derived from ALKþ cell lines, such as NCI-H3122 and
NCI-H2228, also do not show rearrangements in every
cell (data not shown). In theory, such false negatives could
occur due to compression or folding of the DNA that randomly affects the distance between the sequences homologous to the red and green probes, nuclear sectioning
causing loss of the 30 (red) probe binding site, aberrant
probe hybridization, or observer error. Observer error
may be particularly problematic in lung cancer, where the
predominant 50 fusion partner is EML4 that resides only
12 megabases centromeric from ALK on chromosome 2p.
The paracentric inversion that generates the EML4-ALK
fusion causes only minimal separation of the 30 and 50
ALK probes and therefore may be harder to spot than rearrangements involving genes mapped on different chromosomes seen in other ALKþ cancers.9,12 We have similarly
shown that there is also the potential for a cell-by-cell false
positive rate with up to 11% of nontumor cells or tumor
cells within protocol-defined ALK-negative tumors
appearing to demonstrate rearrangement patterns.9
Just as with false negatives, there are also numerous
technical factors that could lead to false positive patterns.
Among them are the stretching of the DNA leading to ar4492

tificial separation of the red and green probe binding sites
from each other, nuclear sectioning causing loss of the 50
(green) probe binding site, aberrant probe hybridization,
or observer error. Whether tumors with any percentage of
positive cells will respond to crizotinib or whether these
are indeed false positive cells (as the detection of positive
patterns in nontumor tissue suggests can sometimes be
the case) is unknown. Further exploration of the cell-bycell false positivity rate would require second screening
techniques such as immunohistochemistry and potentially
wider access to specific inhibitors in the clinic to see if borderline tumors respond. Exploration of the potential for
false cellular negatives in ALK testing by FISH is, however, already possible via retrospective analyses set up to
address a series of specific hypotheses (Table 3). We have
previously shown that the heterogeneity in cellular positivity appears to be a diffuse and not a focal phenomenon
within positive tumors, suggesting that clonal gain or loss
of rearrangements is not the dominant basis of the heterogeneity.9 To further explore whether technique rather
than biology underlies this heterogeneity, we analyzed in
detail the association between patterns of positivity (split
vs single red patterns) and percentage of positive cells and
association between signal copy number (of fused, isolated
red and isolated green signals) and percentage of positive
cells (Fig. 1). The higher percentage of positive cells seen
in tumors with a single red pattern of positivity (74%),
compared to the percentage seen in tumors manifesting a
split pattern (48%) (P < .0001), suggest that difficulties
in detecting the narrow probe separation in the dominant
EML4-ALK paracentric inversion may indeed contribute
toward ‘‘missed’’ true positive cells (Tables 1 and 3).
Given that only one split or single red pattern per
cell is required to call a cell positive, if cells are falsely
called negative because a positive pattern is missed in individual cells, we hypothesized that increases in the signal
copy number associated with positive patterns should be
correlated with a higher percentage of cells being called
positive within any tumor. The strong positive association
between increases in isolated red signal copy number and
percentage of ALK FISHþ cells (r ¼ 0.743, P < .0001)
and between isolated green signal copy number (when
part of a split pattern of positivity) and percentage of
ALKþ cells (r ¼ 0.91, P < .0001) appears to support this
hypothesis (Tables 1 and 3; Fig. 2). The fact that the correlation is even stronger for the isolated red signals when
only tumors with a single red pattern of positivity were
considered, compared with those having a split pattern,
also supports the idea that single red patterns may be
easier to spot than split patterns (r ¼ 0.884, P < .0001 vs

r ¼ 0.558, P < .0001, respectively). As a corollary, the hypothesis is also supported by the observation that overall
isolated green signal copy number (contributing to both
the split pattern of positivity and the single green negative
pattern) did not show a strong association with the percentage of cells positive for a rearrangement (r ¼ 0.264,
P ¼ .012). Similarly, fused signal copy number was negatively associated with the percentage of cells positive for a
rearrangement (r ¼ 0.466, P < .0001), particularly if
the tumor was positive with a split as opposed to a single
red pattern of positivity (r ¼ 0.44, P ¼ .002 vs r ¼
0.042, P ¼ .016), consistent with fused and split patterns being the hardest to distinguish.
If all the variation in percentage cells positive within
a positive tumor only reflects technical aspects of ALK
FISH testing rather than true biological heterogeneity, the
proportion of positive cells should not influence therapeutic outcomes. Specifically, we hypothesized that there
should be no correlation between the percentage of positive cells present in any positive tumor and the maximal
percentage tumor shrinkage per RECIST seen in that tumor after crizotinib treatment; this was indeed the case
(r ¼ 0.192, P ¼ .3) (Table 3; Fig. 3).
Copy number alterations in ALK-related signals
have recently been described.9,10 Although we have
exploited these alterations to address questions about false
cellular negatives in ALKþ tumors, whether copy number

alteration reflected biological variation that was directly
clinically relevant was unknown. Here, we have shown
that neither isolated red (r ¼ 0.274, P ¼ .195) (Fig. 4)
nor isolated green (split pattern) (r ¼ 0.438, P ¼ .117)
nor fused signal (r ¼ 0.247, P ¼ .187) copy number
correlated with the maximal percentage tumor shrinkage
per RECIST after crizotinib treatment.
Potential flaws in the logic underlying these
response-related data include the fact that the percentage
of positive cells and the signal copy number mostly have
been assessed on archival material, whereas the tumor
itself may have changed biologically prior to commencing
crizotinib. In addition, the estimate of tumor shrinkage
per RECIST, although expressed as a percentage, is based
on proportional change in a very specific measurement
calculation (the sum of the longest diameter of a number
of prespecified target lesions) in RECIST, version 1.0.
Therefore, the proportional shrinkage may not reflect the
exact magnitude of the biological response. For example,
it may not be as direct a measure as assessing changes in
tumor volume, and may underestimate the clinical activity of crizotinib in the correlations. However, based on
our data, the lack of correlation between either percentage
of positive cells or fused/rearranged signal copy number,
and crizotinib response does suggest that these are not relevant biological variables to follow with respect to benefit
from ALK inhibition.

Finally, although there was no correlation between
mean copy number of fused and isolated green signal
copy number, mean fused copy number was negatively
associated with isolated red signal copy number (r ¼
0.409, P < .0001) (Table 2). The inverse relationship
between fused and isolated red signal copy number suggests that ALK gene rearrangements may not be a manifestation of simple chromosomal instability in these cancer
cells. Specifically, this raises the possibility that although
there may be some selection pressure for increases in ALK
signal copy number, or that the region around the ALK
gene may be particularly fragile, overall ALK gene rearrangements tend to originate in a distinct ‘‘near-diploid’’
state. Similar near-diploid states have been described,
notably in the microsatellite instability subtype of colorectal cancer.13 This suggests that ALK rearrangements
may occur early in the cancer development process, before
instability changes leading to significant chromosomal
aneusomy occur.
In conclusion, our detailed analyses based on correlations between the percentage of ALKþ cells, patterns of
ALK positivity, and mean signal copy number per tumor
cell and association of these variables with response to
ALK inhibition in ALKþ NSCLC, support the hypothesis
that heterogeneity in the percentage of cells positive
within ALKþ tumors reflects technical rather than biological variation (Table 3). The lack of correlation between
either percentage of cells positive or signal copy number
and response to crizotinib suggests that these are not relevant biological variables to capture with respect to predicting benefit from ALK inhibition in ALKþ tumors. In
addition, the negative association revealed between copy
numbers of fused signals and isolated red signals suggests
the novel hypothesis that ALK gene rearrangements occur
early in cancer development, preceding significant chromosomal aneusomy. Additional studies are warranted to
investigate further whether ALKþ NSCLC is indeed a
‘‘near-diploid’’ subtype of NSCLC.
