Abstract
Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), a constituent of edible cruciferous vegetables, inhibits growth of human breast cancer cells
in culture. The present study provides in vivo evidence for efficacy of BITC for prevention of mammary cancer in MMTVneu mice. Administration of BITC at 1 and 3 mmol/kg diet for
25 weeks markedly suppressed the incidence and/or burden of
mammary hyperplasia and carcinoma in female MMTV-neu
mice without causing weight loss or affecting neu protein
level. For example, cumulative incidence of hyperplasia/carcinoma was significantly lower in mice fed BITC-supplemented
diets compared with control mice (P = 0.01 by Fisher's test).
The BITC-mediated prevention of mammary carcinogenesis
correlated with suppression of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The average number of Ki-67–positive cells
in the carcinoma lesions of 3 mmol BITC group was lower by
∼21% (P < 0.05) compared with tumors from control mice. Apoptotic bodies in the mammary tumor were higher by about 2to 2.5-fold in the 1 and 3 mmol BITC treatment groups (P <
0.05) compared with control group. The BITC administration
also resulted in overexpression of E-cadherin and infiltration
of CD3+ T-cells in the tumor. Although BITC treatment increased cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells in vitro, dietary
feeding of BITC failed to augment NK cell lytic activity in an
ex vivo assay. The present study demonstrating efficacy of
BITC against mammary cancer in an animal model provides
impetus to determine its activity in a clinical setting. [Cancer

Introduction
Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths
in women despite significant advances in screening techniques, allowing for early detection of the disease, as well as continuous evolution of molecularly targeted therapies (1–4). The known risk
factors for breast cancer include family history, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, atypical hyperplasia of the breast, late age at first full-term
pregnancy, early menarche, and late menopause (5–7). Because
some of these risk factors are not modifiable, novel strategies for
prevention of breast cancer are highly desirable. Some success in
prevention of mammary carcinogenesis has been achieved using
selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen, but this
strategy is ineffective against estrogen receptor–negative breast
cancers (8, 9). In addition, selective estrogen receptor modulators

suffer from severe side effects including increased risk of uterine
cancer, thromboembolism, cataracts, and perimenopausal symptoms (8, 9). Accordingly, novel agents that are relatively safe but
which could prevent onset and/or progression of breast cancer
irrespective of the hormone receptor status are attractive. Natural
products have received increased attention in recent years for the
discovery of novel cancer chemopreventive and/or cancer therapeutic agents (10).
Benefit of a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables as a modifier of
the breast cancer risk is recognized by population-based, observational studies. For example, a case-control study involving >300
breast cancer cases and controls (matched by age, menopausal status, etc.) documented an inverse correlation between urinary levels
of isothiocyanates as a biological measure of cruciferous vegetable
intake and the risk of breast cancer (11). Consumption of cruciferous vegetables was inversely associated with the risk of mammary
cancer in premenopausal women in another population-based
case-control study (12).
Anticarcinogenic effect of cruciferous vegetables is attributed
to isothiocyanates, which are generated upon hydrolysis of corresponding glucosinolates through catalytic mediation of myrosinase (13, 14). Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) is one such compound
that has attracted increasing attention because of its ability to
inhibit chemically induced cancer in animal models (13, 14). For
example, BITC is a potent inhibitor of mouse lung carcinogenesis
induced by polycyclic hydrocarbons and hepatocarcinogenesis in
rats induced by diethylnitrosamine (15, 16). Dietary administration
of N-acetylcysteine conjugate of BITC inhibited benzo(a)pyrene–
induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice (17).
Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that BITC inhibits viability of cultured human breast cancer cells by causing apoptosis (18). On the other hand, a spontaneously immortalized
nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A)
is markedly more resistant to BITC-mediated growth inhibition
and apoptosis induction compared with breast cancer cells (18).
We also showed that the proapoptotic effect of BITC against human breast cancer cells is triggered by generation of reactive oxygen species due to inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain
(18, 19).
Despite compelling epidemiologic and cellular evidence suggesting anticancer effect of BITC (11, 12, 18, 19), studies on its in vivo
efficacy against breast cancer are lacking. Here, we show that dietary administration of BITC inhibits incidence and/or burden of
mammary hyperplasia and carcinoma in female MMTV-neu mice
without causing any side effects.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. BITC (purity, ∼98%) was purchased from LKT laboratories.

purchased from Invitrogen. Antibody against neu was purchased from
ThermoFisher Scientific; antibody against Ki-67 was from DakoCytomation; antibody against CD31 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-CD3 antibody was from Biocare Medical; and anti–E-cadherin
antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. ApopTag
Plus Peroxidase In situ Apoptosis detection kit for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was
procured from Chemicon International-Millipore. Control and BITCsupplemented AIN-76A diets were prepared by Harlan-Teklad and stored
at 4°C in airtight containers purged with nitrogen gas. Stability of BITC in
the diet was checked by high-performance liquid chromatography essentially as described by Jiao and colleagues (20).
Chemoprevention protocol. Six-week-old female transgenic MMTVneu mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and were acclimated for 2 wk before start of the experiment. Spontaneous development of
breast cancer in MMTV-neu mice is driven by mammary epithelial expression of the rat erbB2 oncogene under control of the MMTV promoter (21).
The mice were randomized into three groups with 32 mice in each group.
The control mice were placed on basal AIN-76A diet, whereas the experimental groups of mice were fed AIN-76A diet supplemented with either
1 mmol BITC/kg (149.2 mg BITC/kg diet) or 3 mmol BITC/kg (447.6 mg
BITC/kg diet). The diet was replenished every 3 to 4 d at the time of cage

change. Diet consumption and body weights were recorded once weekly.
Each mouse in every group was also monitored on alternate days for signs
of distress including impaired movement or posture, indigestion, and areas
of redness or swelling. Mice were sacrificed at 33 wk of age (25 wk on control or BITC-supplemented diets). The mammary tissues and vital organs
(heart, lung, liver, kidney) were collected at necropsy.
Histopathologic analyses of mammary neoplastic lesions. Concentration-effect relationship for dietary BITC administration on incidence
and burden (area of the mammary gland occupied by the neoplastic lesion)
of mammary hyperplasia and carcinoma were assessed by histopathologic
analyses of H&E-stained sections. Mammary glands from control and
BITC-fed mice were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4-to 5-μm thickness. Three step
sections encompassing the periphery and center of each mammary gland
were included in the analysis. Hyperplasia was characterized by thickened
and multilayered mammary ducts and cells with a large nucleus. Carcinoma was characterized by the loss of ductal structure, uncontrolled expansion of enlarged cells, and invasion of healthy breast tissue. A Leica
microscope equipped with a grid was used for measurement of the area
of the hyperplasia/carcinoma lesions at ×100 magnification.
Immunohistochemistry. Mammary tissues were sectioned at 4- to
5-μm thickness, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. The sections were

quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide and blocked with normal serum. The
sections were then incubated with anti-neu (erbB2), anti–Ki-67, anti–Ecadherin, anti-CD31, or anti-CD3 antibody and washed with TBS followed
by incubation with appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody. A characteristic brown color was developed by incubation with 3,3-diaminobenzidine. For CD3 staining to determine infiltration of T cells, a characteristic
pink color was developed by incubation with Vulcan red. The sections
were examined under a Leica microscope. At least five nonoverlapping representative images were captured from each section using a camera
mounted onto the microscope. The images were analyzed using Image ProPlus 5.0 software from Media Cybernetics for quantitation.
Detection of apoptotic bodies by TUNEL assay. The paraffin-embedded
tissue sections (4- to 5-μm thickness) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and
used to visualize apoptotic cells by TUNEL staining according to the manufacturer's protocol as described by us previously (22).
Measurement of lytic activity of natural killer and/or dendritic
cells. Basal medium for natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells
(DC) was RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, antibiotic mixture, 2 mmol/L
L -glutamine, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids,
50 μmol/L HEPES, and 50 μmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol. The NK cells were
activated by culture for 5 d in medium supplemented with 1,000 units/mL
interleukin (IL)-2. The DC were cultured for 5 d in basal medium supplemented with 0.5 mmol/L NG-methyl-L-arginine monoacetate, 500 ng/mL
IL-4, 500 ng/mL granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, and
25 ng/mL Flt-3. The BRI-JM04 cells, established from spontaneously developing tumor of a MMTV-neu mouse (a generous gift from Dr. Anne
Lenferink, Biotechnology Research Institute, Montreal, Canada; ref. 23),
were used as target cells to measure lytic activity of NK cells and/or
DC. The BRI-JM04 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and antibiotics. For in vitro cytotoxicity
assay, the NK cells and DC were isolated from the spleen and bone marrow, respectively, of 10-wk-old wild-type (untreated) female FVB mice
(24, 25). After isolation, the NK cells and DC were maintained in above
described medium in the absence or presence of 0.1, 1, or 3 μmol/L BITC.
After 5 d, the BITC-containing medium was removed, and the NK cells
(2 × 105 cells/mL) were plated in 96-well plates alone or with DC at a 10:8
(NK cells/DC ratio). After 24 h, BRI-JM04 target cells labeled with 51Cr
were added to the wells at specified ratios. The plates were spun down
after 4 h and 50 μL of the supernatant was used for analysis of 51Cr

release using a scintillation counter. The NK cells and DC, respectively,
isolated from the spleen and bone marrow of control and BITC-fed
MMTV-neu mice were used to determine ex vivo lytic activity against
BRI-JM04 target cells essentially as described above.
Statistical analyses. Statistical significance of difference in hyperplasia/
carcinoma incidence between control and BITC treatment groups was determined by one-tailed Fisher's exact test. Statistical significance of difference in burden (area of the neoplastic lesion) of mammary neoplastic
lesions between groups was determined by a one-sided Wilcoxon test. A
two-tailed t test was used to determine the statistical significance of difference in cell proliferation (Ki-67 expression), vessel area (CD31 staining), and
apoptotic bodies (TUNEL) between control and BITC treatment groups.

Results
Dietary BITC administration inhibited mammary cancer in
MMTV-neu mice. Dose-dependent inhibition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-induced [benzo(a)pyrene, 5-methychrysene,
and dibenz(a,h)anthracene] pulmonary tumor incidence and/or
multiplicity in mice by gavage of BITC has been showed previously
(26). For example, the benzo(a)pyrene-induced pulmonary tumor
multiplicity in female A/J mice was reduced by about 63% and
81% by gavage of 6.7 and 13.4 μmol BITC, respectively, administered 15 min before the carcinogen challenge (26). In the present
study, we used a well-characterized mouse model (21) to determine mammary cancer chemopreventive efficacy of dietary BITC
administration. Doses of the BITC for the present study were selected from previous chemoprevention studies involving chemically induced tumor models (26–28). The BITC-supplemented diet
was well tolerated by the mice and did not result in weight loss
compared with age-matched controls (Fig. 1A). Histology of the vital organs of mice placed on BITC-supplemented diets was also
normal (data not shown). However, there were seven deaths in
the control group and six and three mice each respectively died
before the termination of the study in the 1 and 3 mmol BITC/
kg diet groups. Necropsies on the deceased mice by a veterinary

technician were inconclusive to pinpoint the cause of death. The average body weight of the mice in the 3 mmol BITC/kg diet group was
smaller compared with control mice at the onset of the study and
this differential was maintained at the termination of the experiment (Fig. 1A). Average food consumption (grams/day/mouse)
was modestly but statistically significantly higher in 3 mmol
BITC/kg diet group compared with the control group (Fig. 1B).
The H&E-stained sections depicting hyperplastic structures (identified by an arrow) in representative mammary gland of a control
mouse and a mouse from the 3 mmol BITC/kg diet group are shown
in Fig. 1C. The incidence of mammary hyperplasia in control mice
was ∼60%, which was reduced by ∼42% in the 1 mmol BITC/kg diet
group (P = 0.06 compared with control by Fisher's test) and by ~37%
in the 3 mmol BITC/kg diet group (P = 0.09 compared with control
by Fisher's test; Fig. 1D). Statistical comparison between the control
group and combined 1 and 3 mmol BITC/kg diet groups revealed
significant reduction in mammary hyperplasia incidence upon dietary BITC administration (P = 0.05 by Fisher's test; control versus
combined 1 and 3 mmol BITC/kg diet groups).
Mean area of the mammary hyperplasia in the control group
(6.6 ± 5.1 mm2) was higher compared with that in mice fed 1 mmol
BITC/kg diet (0.12 ± 0.09 mm2; P = 0.06 compared with control) or
3 mmol BITC/kg diet (0.13 ± 0.08 mm2; P = 0.08 compared with control; Fig. 1D). Average area of the hyperplasia from the combined
1 and 3 mmol BITC/kg diet groups was statistically significantly
lower compared with that of control mice (P = 0.04 by Wilcoxon test
compared with control). These results indicated that dietary BITC
administration inhibited mammary hyperplasia incidence and burden in MMTV-neu mice without causing side effects.
As expected, several mice in each group developed palpable tumors
by the end of the study. The H&E-stained sections depicting carcinoma in mammary gland of a representative control mouse and a

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (24). December 15, 2009

mouse from the 3 mmol BITC/kg diet group are shown in Fig. 2A.
Approximately 72% of the control mice developed carcinoma
(Fig. 2B). The incidence of carcinoma was reduced by ∼25% in mice
fed 1 mmol BITC/kg diet compared with control, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.15 by Fisher's test).
The incidence of mammary carcinoma was lower by ∼33% (P = 0.07
by Fisher's test) in mice fed 3 mmol BITC/kg diet compared with
control mice (Fig. 2B). When the results were computed to include
hyperplasia, carcinoma in situ, and adenocarcinoma (collectively
termed as abnormal structure), the incidence of the abnormal structure was significantly lower in mice fed BITC-supplemented diets
compared with control mice (Fig. 2C; P = 0.01 by Fisher's test).
Effect of dietary BITC administration on neu protein expression. Next, we considered the possibility that BITC-mediated
prevention of mammary carcinogenesis in MMTV-neu mice was
due to suppression of the transgene expression. As expected, high
level of neu protein was detectable in the mammary hyperplasia
and carcinoma of the control mice (Fig. 3). The expression of the
neu protein was not altered by dietary feeding of BITC (Fig. 3).
These observations led us to conclude that the BITC-mediated prevention of mammary carcinogenesis in MMTV-neu mice was not
due to the suppression of the transgene expression.
BITC administration inhibited cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in the tumor. Figure 4A depicts immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67 expression in mammary tumor from a
representative mouse of both the control group and the 3 mmol
BITC/kg diet group. The Ki-67 is a large nuclear protein expressed
during all active phases of the cell cycle and is a well-accepted marker
of cellular proliferation (29). As can be seen in Fig. 4A (right), expression of the Ki-67 was significantly lower in the mammary tumor of the
mice fed 3 mmol BITC/kg diet compared with mice placed on basal
AIN-76A diet. For example, average number of the Ki-67–positive

cells per high power field in the tumor of 3 mmol BITC/kg diet was
lower by ∼21% (P < 0.05 compared with control by two-tailed Student's t test) compared with tumors from control mice (Fig. 4A).
The BITC administration resulted in a statistically significant increase in number of apoptotic bodies in the tumor as visualized
by TUNEL assay (Fig. 4B). The TUNEL-positive apoptotic bodies
in the mammary tumor were higher by ∼2-fold in the 1 mmol
BITC/kg diet group and by ∼2.5-fold in the 3 mmol BITC/kg diet
group (P < 0.05 by two-tailed Student's t test) compared with control (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that dietary BITC administration resulted in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis
in the mammary tumor especially at the 3 mmol/kg diet dose.
Effect of BITC administration on tumor angiogenesis. Because neoangiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) is critical

for tumor growth (30), mammary carcinoma from the control and
1 and 3 mmol BITC/kg diet group were stained for angiogenesis
marker CD31 (also known as platelet cell endothelial adhesion
molecule). Immunohistochemical staining for CD31 in the mammary tumor of a representative mouse from both the control group
and the 1 and 3 mmol BITC/kg diet group are shown in Fig. 4C
(vessels are identified by arrows). Although the vessel area was
smaller in the tumors from 1 mmol/kg BITC-fed mice compared
with control, the difference did not reach statistical significance
(Fig. 4C, right).
BITC administration resulted in overexpression of tumor
E-cadherin expression. E-cadherin is considered a suppressor of
invasion and growth of many epithelial cancers (31). We therefore
compared expression of E-cadherin in mammary tumor from the

through granule-mediated exocytosis and induction of apoptosis
(32). Initially, we determined lytic activity of NK cells cultured in
the presence of varying concentrations of BITC for 5 days against
BRI-JM04 target cells. As can be seen in Fig. 5A, the NK cytotoxicity
was increased to ∼83% in the presence of 0.1 μmol/L BITC compared
with ∼37% specific cytotoxicity observed in absence of BITC. Interestingly, this effect was abolished at higher concentrations of BITC,
possibly due to a cytotoxic effect of BITC on NK cells especially at the
3 μmol/L concentration. Because interaction of NK cells with DC results in coactivation of both cell types (33), we also determined
in vitro cytotoxicity following coculture of NK cells and DC for 5 days
with or without BITC. Similar to NK cells alone, presence of 0.1
μmol/L BITC, but not the 1 or 3 μmol/L dose, in culture media augmented cytotoxicity of NK cells and DC cocultures (Fig. 5B). These
experiments, which were repeated thrice with similar results, suggested that low concentrations of BITC could augment lytic activity
of NK cells and NK cells-DC cocultures. Next, we tested ex vivo cytotoxicity of NK cells and DC isolated from the spleen and bone marrow, respectively, of control and BITC-fed mice using BRI-JM04 as a
target cell line. The results presented in Fig. 5C do not show any significant improvement in cytotoxicity of NK cells alone or NK cellsDC cocultures from BITC-fed mice compared with control mice.
BITC administration increased tumor infiltration of T cells.
In addition to NK cells, T cells are also implicated in surveillance of
tumors (34, 35). Presence of infiltrating T cells in the tumor was examined by immunohistochemistry of CD3, a pan T-cell marker. Infiltrating T cells (identified by arrows) were visible in the tumors of
control mice (Fig. 6A) as well as in the tumors of 1 and 3 mmol
BITC/kg diet groups (Fig. 6B). Fraction of infiltrating CD3+ T cells
in the tumor of mice fed 3 mmol BITC/kg diet was ∼70% higher in
comparison with control mice (P = 0.06 by two-tailed Student's t test).
These results suggested that the anticancer effect of dietary BITC administration was accompanied by an increase in T-cell surveillance.

Discussion
Overexpression of neu due to the amplification of neu gene is
linked with breast cancer (36). The neu-positive tumors account
for ∼20% of all breast cancers and these tumors tend to be more
aggressive with poor prognosis (37). In the present study, we used
a mouse model with mammary-specific expression of the neu oncogene to test in vivo chemopreventive efficacy of dietary BITC administration. We found that BITC administration in the diet
suppresses incidence and/or burden of mammary hyperplasia
and carcinoma in MMTV-neu mice without causing weight loss
or any other adverse effects. However, we were puzzled by the
deaths of some mice in each group before termination of the study.
Because more mice died in the control group and the necropsy was
inconclusive, we conclude that the deaths were not related to BITC
administration. The BITC-mediated prevention of mammary carcinogenesis was evident at concentrations that can be generated
through dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables (13, 14).
We have shown previously that BITC treatment suppresses
growth of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231)
in association with apoptosis induction regardless of estrogen
responsiveness or p53 status (18). Cultured cancer cells are invaluable not only for rapid screening of potential cancer chemopreventive agents but also for elucidation of the mechanism of their

action. However, in vivo validation of the cellular findings is a critical step in clinical development of promising anticancer agents.
Consistent with cellular data (18, 19), dietary BITC administration
elicits growth inhibitory and proapoptotic response in vivo in the
MMTV-neu model. Expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 in
the mammary tumor of MMTV-neu mice is reduced significantly
upon administration of 3 mmol BITC/kg diet. Likewise, the spontaneous tumors from BITC-fed mice exhibit significantly higher
count of TUNEL-positive apoptotic bodies in comparison with
control tumors. Based on these observations, we conclude that cell
proliferation and apoptosis are valid biomarkers to assess BITC response in future clinical trials.
E-cadherin, a single-span transmembrane glycoprotein of five repeats and cytoplasmic domain, plays an important role in normal
physiologic processes including development, cell polarity, and tissue morphology (38). E-cadherin is considered a tumor suppressor
because of its role in inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (31, 39, 40). E-cadherin is frequently downregulated during cancer progression and correlates with poor prognosis (41). Expression
of E-cadherin has been shown to reduce progression and invasiveness of breast tumors (42). The present study reveals that dietary
BITC administration causes a marked increase in expression of Ecadherin protein in the tumor of the MMTV-neu mice. Our preliminary unpublished studies indicate that BITC treatment indeed
inhibits migration of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells at
pharmacologically relevant concentrations.4 Thus, it is reasonable
to conclude that E-cadherin overexpression probably contributes to
mammary cancer prevention by dietary BITC administration. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of
BITC-mediated induction of E-cadherin protein expression.
The NK cells are the earliest responders of the innate immune
system and have been broadly implicated in tumor immune surveillance (32, 43). We assessed the immunomodulatory potential
of BITC in vitro and found that it can augment NK cell cytotoxicity
at low concentrations. However, augmentation of NK cell activity
was not evident in an ex vivo assay. The T cells are involved in cellmediated immunity, and have been implicated in the control of
tumor development (44, 45). We observed an increase in T-cell infiltration in the tumors from BITC-fed MMTV-neu mice compared
with controls. These results suggest that the BITC-mediated prevention of mammary carcinogenesis may be mediated by infiltration of cytotoxic T cells.
In conclusion, the present study indicates that dietary BITC administration inhibits mammary carcinogenesis in MMTV-neu mice
without causing weight loss or any other side effects. We show further that the BITC-mediated prevention of mammary cancer correlates with reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, CD3+
T-cell infiltration, and overexpression of E-cadherin. These preclinical observations merit clinical investigation of BITC for its efficacy
against human breast cancer.
