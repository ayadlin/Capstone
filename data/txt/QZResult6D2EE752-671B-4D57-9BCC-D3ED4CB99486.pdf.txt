ABSTRACT
During the last decade, the burst of interest is observed to antidiabetic biguanide
metformin as candidate drug for cancer chemoprevention. The analysis of the
available data have shown that the efficacy of cancer preventive effect of metformin
(MF) and another biguanides, buformin (BF) and phenformin (PF), has been studied
in relation to total tumor incidence and to 17 target organs, in 21 various strains
of mice, 4 strains of rats and 1 strain of hamsters (inbred, outbred, transgenic,
mutant), spontaneous (non- exposed to any carcinogenic agent) or induced by 16
chemical carcinogens of different classes (polycycIic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitroso
compounds, estrogen, etc.), direct or indirect (need metabolic transformation
into proximal carcinogen), by total body X-rays and γ- irradiation, viruses, genetic
modifications or special high fat diet, using one stage and two-stage protocols of
carcinogenesis, 5 routes of the administration of antidiabetic biguanides (oral gavage,
intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injections, with drinking water or with diet) in a wide
ranks of doses and treatment regimens. In the majority of cases (86%) the treatment
with biguanides leads to inhibition of carcinogenesis. In 14% of the cases inhibitory
effect of the drugs was not observed. Very important that there was no any case of
stimulation of carcinogenesis by antidiabetic biguanides. It was conclude that there is
sufficient experimental evidence of anti-carcinogenic effect of antidiabetic biguanides.

INTRODUCTION

type 2 diabetes mellitus and this may have already saved
more people from cancer death than any drug in history.[2]
Recently it was announced an ambition project of clinical
trial called TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin)
proposed by Nir Barzilai and colleagues (Albert Einstein
College of Medicine in New York).[3, 4]. They are going
to give MF during 5-7 years to 3,000 people aged 70-80
years who already has one or two of three age-associated
diseases (heart disease, cancer, cognitive decline). Authors
are expected delay these pathologies and death. Persons
with type 2 diabetics (T2D) cannot be enrolled due to they
were already treated with MF. This project based on the
data on the increase of life span of mice and rats given
MF and on results of clinical observation on 15% increase
in survival of T2D patients primarily treated with MF as
compared with healthy people without diabetes. [5] These
findings and planning of the TAME clinical trial rise the
question on the safety of long-term administration of MF
in non-diabetic people.

Cancer prevention is one of main goals of
fundamental and clinical oncology. As it was stressed
in the preamble to the IARC Handbooks of Cancer
Prevention, preventive strategies embrace chemical,
immunological, dietary and behavioral interventions that
may retard, block or reverse carcinogenic processes or
reduce underlying risk factors.[1]
In fourteen volumes of this series of handbooks were
collected and critically evaluated available data on cancer
preventing effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, carotenoids, vitamin A, retinoids, indoles and
isothiocyanates, some fruits and vegetables, tobacco and
body weight control programs, breast and cervix cancer
screening programs (www.iarc.fr). During the last decade
there is a burst of interest to cancer prevention potential of
antidiabetic biguanide metformin. More than 120 million
prescriptions of MF are written yearly for treatment of

In present article, we evaluated available
results of preclinical studies on anti-carcinogenic
and geroprotector effects of metformin (N,Ndimethylbiguanide, MF) and other antidiabetic biguanides
phenformin (1-phenylethylbiguanide, PF) and buformin
(1-butylbiguanide hydrochloride, BF) and perspectives
of its wide introduction in clinical practice. We focused
mainly on end-point results of studies, doses and route
of administration of biguanides to get answers to two
critical questions: (1) are biguanides effective in cancer
prevention in non-diabetic organism? and (2) are they safe
in long-term treatment? Mechanisms of geroprotective,
anti-carcinogenic and antitumor effects of biguanides
are intensively studied at present. There are a lot of
comprehensive reviews on this topic, [6-15] which could
be recommend to readers.

Dilman [32] proposed the idea of metabolic
rehabilitation for cancer patients giving them biguanides
and maintaining on calorie restricted diet. Treatment with
PF decreased incidence of metastases and increased 5-year
survival in breast, stomach and colon cancers patients [33,
34] In the late 1970s due to high incidence of adverse
effects (severe lactic acidosis) phenformin was forbidden
for clinical use and metformin possessed in much less
adverse effects started toward nowadays.[15, 34]
After the wave of publications on anti-carcinogenic
effect of PF and BF in 1974-1985 with absolute peak in
1980-1982, during next 20 years only one report appeared
on inhibitory effect of MF on chemical carcinogenesis
of pancreas in hamsters.[35] It seems that interest to this
effect was lost, and these very impressive results have
been forgotten. In 2003 we have published results of our
early studies on anti-carcinogenic and geroprotective
effects of antidiabetic biguanides recalculated at MaxPlank Institute for Demographic Research at Rostock,
Germany [36] and started new series of experiments using
metformin.
In 2005 we firstly have found that treatment with
MF inhibits mammary carcinogenesis and increases the
life span of female HER-2/neu transgenic mice. [37] At
the same year, Evans et al. [38] and then Bowker et al.
[39] reported that treatment with metformin decreased the
breast cancer risk. These studies induced the second huge
wave, like tsunami - an exponential growth of number of
publications on MF and cancer. A search in the PubMed on
key words “metformin and cancer” shows 1 publication in
1995; 23 articles in 2000, 88 - in 2005, 175 - in 2010, 281
- in 2012, 350 - in 2013, 408 - in 2014. From 1st January
to 1st October, 2015 - 330 articles on the topic appeared in
PubMed! There are a near hundred excellent reviews and
meta-analyzes of epidemiological data on MF effect on
cancer risk in type 2 diabetes patients. We refer readers to
some of them.[40-44]
During 2005-2010 nineteen original research articles
with results of studies on anti-carcinogenic effect of MF
in rodent models have been published, and in 2011- 2015
– 27 papers. The available data on the results of in vivo
studies on effects of biguanides involved more than 20
experimental models of carcinogenesis are summarized
in the Table 1. They included models of spontaneous
carcinogenesis (in rat and mice), chemical carcinogenesis
induced by 16 different chemical carcinogens and tumor
promoters, viruses, dietetic modifications, ionizing
irradiation, transgenic and knockout mice. Antidiabetic
biguanides were given with diet, drinking water, orally
(gavage), intraperitoneally or subcutaneously. To the
date, we found in total 65 publications reported results of
original studies. Experiments have been performed on 21
strains of mice (8 inbred, 3 outbred,10 genetically modified
mouse strains), 4 rat strains and 1 - hamsters. Effect of
antidiabetic biguanides have been studied in 17 target
organs/tissues. The majority was focused on mammary

Antidianetic biguanides: Milestones in the drugs
history
In the early 1900s, guanidine was identified as
active compound of botanic medicine Galega officinalis
(French Lilac) commonly used in midevial Europe for the
treatment of polyurea in diabetic patients.[15] This was
followed by development of antidiabetic biguanides in the
1920s, however due to the discovery of insulin in 1921
only thirty years late the first biguanides (phenformin,
buformin and metformin) were synthesized. The drugs
were approved in the middle of last century in the USA an
Europe for the treatment of T2D.
In the 1971, Dilman [16] proposed that antidiabetic
biguanides may be promising as a potent anti-aging
and anti-cancer drugs. In the middle of 1970s Dilman
at the N.N. Petrov Research Institute of Oncology (St.
Petersburg, Russia) initiated the series of experiments in
mice and rats to test this hypothesis. In 1974, it was shown
in the first time that PF inhibits 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)
anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary carcinogenesis
in female rats.[17] Five years later, the first article on
the inhibitory effect of PF on spontaneous mammary
carcinogenesis and life span extension in cancer-prone
female C3H/Sn mice has been published. [18, 19] At the
same period it have been reported on inhibitory effect of
both PF and BF on spontaneous carcinogenesis in female
rats, [20, 21] and on carcinogenesis induced by DMBA
or N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU) in mammary gland [2224], by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) – in colon [25, 26],
by N-nitrosoethylurea (NEU) and N-nitrosomethylurea
(NMU) in kidney and nervous system [27, 28], by
20-methylcholanthrene – in soft tissues, [29] by X-rays
- in lymphoid tissue [30] In 1987, we summarized the
results of experimental studies on anti-carcinogenic effects
of antidiabetic biguanides in special section of our book
“Carcinogenesis and Aging”, Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press,
1987, vol.2. [31]

gland (21 experiments) and colon tumors (11studies),
uterus (5) and liver (7) that reflects the importance of these
localizations for clinical practice. Effect of biguanides on
total tumor incidence was evaluated in 8 studies. Positive
results only (inhibitory effect) induced by treatment with
biguanides have been observed in 13 localizations (76%).
In colon cancer models, 8 of 11 studies (72.7%) revealed
of positive effect of biguanides, whereas in mammary
tumor the inhibitory effect of these drugs was shown 15
out 21 experiments (71.4%) and 6 studies (28.6%) failed to
show inhibitory effect of the drugs. It worthy to note that
there were no cases observed of stimulation of any type of
carcinogenesis with antidiabetic biguanides. Only in one
study the obese and diabetic mice were used.[87] In all
studies on effect of biguanides on induced carcinogenesis,
young adult rodents were commonly used, and only in one
article the results of the treatment with MF started at the
young, adult and old age have been published.[91] Also,
only one study was focused on tumorigenesis in mice
neonatally exposed to MF.[90] Comprehensive analysis
of the results of experimental studies on anti-carcinogenic
effect of antidiabetic biguanides has been done recently.

liver than in lungs. Absolute levels of MF was 6.1 µM in
plasma of mice that were allowed to drink MF ad libitum
whereas in mice exposed to a single i.p. injection or
gavage – 29.1 and 12.27 µM respectively. It was estimated
that human equivalent dose (milligram per kilogram)
equal to animal dose (milligram per kilogram) x animal
Km/ human Km, where species and Km values are based on
body surface area (Km for adult human weighted 60 kg is
37, and Km for mouse weighted 20 g is 3.[106] Tan et al.
[69] calculated that daily i.p. administration of 125 mg/kg
MF into mice is equivalent to human dose 600 mg/average
size person of 60 kg and concluded that the dose of 125
mg/kg is approximately 4 times less than the maximum
safe dose of MF (2500 mg/day). Thus, doses MF less than
500 mg/kg in mice yielded plasma level of MF practically
similar to that in diabetic patients. Our calculation have
shown that used in our experiments dose of MF 100 mg/kg
equal to 300 mg/m2 of the surface area. Recalculation for
humans gives in average 510 mg/m2, that is much less that
commonly used in clinical practice (1.0 – 2.5 g per day).
We believe that studies on the effect of various routes of
metformin administration at various doses levels will very
helpful for a search most optimal regimens for prevention
and treatment of cancer.

Impact of dose and route of administration on
effects of metformin

CONCLUSIONS
The history of biguanides in oncology started in
70th of last century at N.N. Petrov Research Institute of
Oncology by Dilman and his colleagues is rather dramatic
and seems not came to “a happy end” at present time. First
publications in 1974-1982 showing the high potential of
PF and BF in prevention of spontaneous and induced by
chemical carcinogens, X-rays and viruses carcinogenesis
were not met an interest adequate to the degree of real
importance of these finding. Whereas the both in vitro
and in vivo experiments provide new evidences of anticarcinogenic potential of biguanides, and the majority of
clinical observations clearly demonstrates protective effect
of MF in relation to many localization of cancer (see Box
1), there are some publications on results of clinical trials
that are inconclusive and sometime were demonstrated
adverse effect of MF. [34, 107] Recently Bio Med Central
Biology published interview with N. Chandel [108] who
as an explanation of possible reasons for this inconsistence
cited rather sardonic comment of M. Pollack – one of the
leaders in the topic: “The problem with metformin is it’s
cheap, it’s widely available, it has a great safety profile,
and anyone can use it”. Really, it is difficult to say better…
In PubMed, under the words such as “metformin and
cancer” the number of indexed papers were increasing
exponentially from zero in 1990 to more than 2500 last
September. Among them around 185 reviews on the topic
were published only during last 5 years. So there are too
many works and still there is no final conclusion. May
be the time became to make this long story short. We

The selection of adequate dose of MF is one of
most discussed questions. Some authors believe that the
doses of MF used in in vitro studies much more than
concentration of MF in the blood of patients.[15] Graham
et al. [105] have shown that after a single dose a peak
plasma concentration of MF in T2D patients was in ranges
from 0.5 to 2 µg/mL (4 µM to 15 µM). In the majority
of in vitro studies MF inhibited tumor growth in doses
from 0.5 to 50 mM. It seems really much more than in
human. In studies on antitumor effect using xenografs
of human tumors into athymic nude mice as well as with
transplantable tumor lines, MF was given with drinking
water in the concentrations from 0.1 to 5 mg/mL, orally
or intraperitoneally in doses of from 50 to 300 mg/kg
of the body weight. [92, 93, 96, 97] In the studies of
anticarcinogenic potential of MF it was administered
with drinking water in concentrations from 0.1 to 1 mg/
mL, with diet in doses from 800 to 2000 ppm, orally in
doses from 100 to300 mg/kg of the body weight (Table
1). After repeated administration, MF does not accumulate
in the plasma and did not bind to plasma proteins.
Biodistribution of [14]C-labeled MF has been studied in
mice 1 hour after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (250 mg/
kg) or gavage (5 mg/mL), and in mice allowed to drink
oral MF dissolved in water (5 mg/mL) ad libitum during
5 days. [63] The authors observed practically similar
patterns of MF distribution after a single i.p. or gavage
administration with MF levels about 4.5 times higher in
