Abstract
Incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is driven by androgen
receptor (AR) activation. Potent therapies that prevent AR signaling, such as
Enzalutamide (ENZ), are mainstay treatments for CRPC; however patients eventually
progress with ENZ resistant (ENZR) disease. In this study, we investigated one
mechanism of ENZ resistance, and tried to improve therapeutic efficiency of ENZ.
We found HER2 expression is increased in ENZR tumors and cell lines, and is induced
by ENZ treatment of LNCaP cells. ENZ-induced HER2 overexpression was dependent
on AKT-YB1 activation and modulated AR activity. HER2 dependent AR activation
in LNCaP and ENZR cells was effectively blocked by treatment with the EGFR/HER2
inhibitor Lapatinib, which reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis. Despite
efficacy in vitro, in vivo monotherapy with Lapatinib did not prevent ENZR tumor
growth. However, combination treatment of Lapatinib with ENZ most effectively
induced cell death in LNCaP cells in vitro and was more effective than ENZ alone in
preventing tumor growth in an in vivo model of CRPC. These results suggest that
while HER2 overexpression and subsequent AR activation is a targetable mechanism
of resistance to ENZ, therapy using Lapatinib is only a rational therapeutic approach
when used in combination with ENZ in CRPC.

INTRODUCTION

growth-promoting effects of androgens and activates
apoptosis in PCa tumors cells [2], prolonging median
overall survival for PCa patients [3]. Despite high initial
response rates, remissions following ADT are temporary
due to the emergence of castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC), where tumors grow in the presence of low
levels of androgens.
Because AR activation remains a central mechanism
driving CRPC progression [4], targeting the AR with antiandrogen drugs remains a critical component of novel
CRPC therapies [5, 6]. Enzalutamide (ENZ) is a second
generation anti-androgen that has significant anti-tumor
effects both in vitro and in vivo. Despite the fact that
ENZ does improve survival in CRPC patients, it does
not lead to complete regression, with tumors recurring

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common male
cancer in North America and 2nd leading cause of cancer
deaths [1]. While many gains have been made in early
detection and treatment of localized PCa, many men
still die of recurrent, metastatic disease. This occurs
when androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the standard
treatment for advanced localized and metastatic PCa, fails.
Androgens are principal factors in PCa carcinogenesis and
progression, regulating gene and signaling networks that
promote cell survival through binding with the androgen
receptor (AR), a ligand-responsive transcription factor.
ADT therefore, including medical or chemical castration
and the use of non-steroidal anti-androgens, blocks the

CRPC.

in a mean time of 47 weeks [7]. Therefore, despite the
efficacy of ENZ in the short term, the development of
ENZ resistant (ENZR) tumors in CRPC represents a
significant challenge in the treatment of advanced PCa.
As such, studying the mechanisms driving resistance to
ENZ is critical to improve the future of PCa therapy. In
this study, we tried to resolve the importance of the HER2
signaling pathway as mechanism of resistance to ENZ and
evaluate the potential of targeting HER2 to improve the
therapeutic efficacy of ENZ.
Previous data from our laboratory suggests that
as in CRPC, re-activation of the AR occurs during ENZ
resistance [8]. In androgen deprived conditions, continued
AR activity can result from variable combinations
of AR gene amplification, increased AR sensitivity,
promiscuous AR binding mutants, altered expression of
co-regulators, increases in androgen biosynthesis as well
as ligand independent activation by oncogenic signaling
pathways [9-12]. In particular, there is increasing evidence
suggesting that activation of the EGFR/HER2 pathway is
important in driving PCa progression. Multiple reports
have indicated that HER2 can activate the AR in androgen
deprived conditions [13-15]. Furthermore, EGFR/HER2
expression levels increase with PCa disease progression
to CRPC [16] and are also highly upregulated in lymph
node metastases [17]. Interestingly however, although
targeting of EGFR/HER2 can suppress prostate tumor
xenograft growth in in vivo models [18, 19], trials using
EGFR/HER2 inhibitors such the EGFR inhibitor Gefetinib
[20] or the dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor Lapatinib [21]
as single agents in patients with CRPC do not improve
overall survival or decrease PSA (a surrogate marker of
AR activity). These studies suggest therefore, that HER2
activation of AR signaling is potentially a mechanism of
resistance to ENZ and that combination therapy using
potent anti-androgens like ENZ with HER2 targeting
agents may be a more viable way to prevent ARreactivation in CRPC patients.
Using ENZR tumor cell lines and LNCaP cells
treated with ENZ, we found that HER2 overexpression is
both associated with ENZ resistance and a consequence
of ENZ treatment. In addition, our data indicates that
ENZ-mediated HER2 expression is dependent on the
transcription factor YB-1 and that HER2 controls AR
activation, potentially through a feed forward mechanism
of upregulation of AKT, which is known to activate both
YB-1 and the AR itself. Indeed we show that the EGFR/
HER2 inhibitor Lapatinib prevented AR activation in both
LNCaP and ENZR cell lines and reduced cell viability.
While ENZR cell lines were more susceptible in vitro
to Lapatinib, monotherapy in vivo was ineffective in
preventing ENZR tumor growth. However, in our in vivo
model of CRPC, combination therapy of Lapatinib with
ENZ was more effective in preventing tumor growth than
ENZ treatment alone. Taken together these data provide
proof-of-principle that combination therapy using ENZ

RESULTS
HER2 overexpression is associated with ENZ
treatment and resistance in prostate cancer
Hyperactivation of oncogenic signaling pathways
including HER2 have been implicated as mechanisms
driving re-activation of the AR in CRPC and thus
contribute to resistance to anti-androgen therapies [16,
17]. We found that HER2 was up-regulated in ENZR
tumors compared to CRPC controls tumors (Fig. 1A).
Immunohistochemistry analysis also showed that HER2
is highly up-regulated in ENZR tumors compared to
CRPC (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, HER2 expression was
highly expressed at the protein level in ENZ-resistant cell
lines established from ENZ-resistant tumors compared
to cell lines derived from CRPC tumors or the prostate
cancer cell line C4-2 (Fig. 1C). In addition, we found
that ENZ induces HER2 in a time- dependent manner
in castrate-sensitive LNCaP and castrate-resistant C4-2
cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that
treatment of PCa with the anti-androgen ENZ increases
HER2 expression, which may be a mechanism of therapy
resistance.

ENZ induces HER2 via AKT-YB1 signaling
To investigate the molecular mechanism by
which ENZ may upregulate HER2 expression in PCa
cells, we assessed the activity of the AKT/YB-1 signal
transduction pathway. Previous reports have shown that
ENZ induces activation of AKT [22]; in turn, activated
AKT leads to phospho-activation of the transcription
and translation factor YB-1 [23]. Since YB-1 binds
to the promoter of HER2 [24] leading to its increased
expression, we hypothesized that ENZ increases HER2
by activating AKT/YB1. Indeed, we found that in LNCaP
cells ENZ induced phosphorylation of AKT in a time
dependent manner with concomitant increase of YB-1
phosphorylation (Fig 2A). Accordingly, phosphorylation
of YB-1 was associated with ENZ-induced YB-1 nuclear
translocation (Fig. 2B), implicating its ability to function
as a transcription factor. To investigate whether YB-1
is required for HER2 expression after ENZ treatment,
we first assessed YB-1 binding to the HER2 promoter
region previously identified as being critical for HER2
transcription by YB-1 [25]. ENZ treatment increased
binding of YB-1 to the HER2 promoter as measured by
ChIP assay (Fig. 2C), suggesting that YB-1 was required
for increased levels of HER2 under these conditions.
Further validating our hypothesis that YB-1 activated

by ENZ is required for HER2 expression, we found that
targeting YB-1 with siRNA abrogated ENZ induced HER2
upregulation at the mRNA (Fig. 2D) and protein level (Fig.
2E). Moreover, we observed predominantly nuclear YB-1
localization in the ENZR cell line MR49F compared to
LNCaP (Fig. 2F). Overall, these results suggest that ENZ
induces AKT phosphorylation which will activate YB-1,
and trigger its nuclear translocation. This allows YB-1 to
act as a transcription factor that binds the Y-box in HER2
to activate HER2 expression (Fig. 2G).

we examined the effect of Lapatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2
inhibitor, on AR signaling. As expected, we found that
Lapatinib treatment induced a decrease of AR regulated
genes at the protein and mRNA level in LNCaP cells (Fig.
3A-B) and PSA promoter activity was also significantly
reduced in Lapatinib treated LNCaP cells after androgen
stimulation (Fig. 3C). This was associated with decreased
nuclear AR in Lapatinib treated cells (Fig. 3D).
Accordingly, Lapatinib also inhibited androgen mediated
AR binding to the androgen-responsive element (ARE)
in the promoter region of PSA (PSA ARE+) (Fig. 3E).
These results indicate that suppression of EGFR/HER2
signaling with Lapatinib inhibits AR activity in PCa cells
and suggest the increased dependence of HER2 mediated
AR activation in ENZR cells.

HER2 inhibition by Lapatinib blocks AR
activation
One important consequence of increased HER2
signaling in CRPC is re-activation of the AR [15, 26, 27],
which also occurs during ENZ resistance [8]. Our results
showing increased HER2 expression in ENZR cell lines
suggest that as in CRPC, HER2 activation of the AR
may be a mechanism of resistance to ENZ. Therefore,

cells, Lapatinib treated ENZR MR49C and MR49F cells
showed a reduction in AR and PSA expression (Fig. 4A).
Probasin luciferase activity in both ENZR cell lines was
also significantly inhibited by Lapatinib, in both androgen
stimulated and unstimulated conditions (Fig. 4B). Reduced
AR signaling in ENZR cells treated with Lapatinib was
associated with increased frequency of cells in the SubG0

Lapatinib suggested that Lapatinib may improve efficacy
of ENZ or target ENZ resistance. To investigate this
hypothesis further we assessed PCa cell growth after
Lapatinib treatment in vitro and in vivo. As in LNCaP

effectively reduced viability of ENZR MR49C and
MR49F cells in vitro and these cells were more sensitive
than LNCaP cells to treatment (Fig. 4E).
Our in vitro results further support the hypothesis
that HER2 mediated AR activation is a mechanism of

resistance to ENZ and suggest that this mechanism can be
overcome by targeted HER2 inhibition with Lapatinib. To
investigate this possibility further, we questioned whether
Lapatinib would be an effective monotherapy against
ENZR tumors in vivo. Contrasting our in vitro results,
we found that Lapatinib had no effect on growth of ENZ

resistant MR49F tumors in castrated male mice compared
to vehicle alone (Fig. 4F). While in contrast to our in vitro
findings, these results support previous data from our
laboratory which showed that further targeting the AR in
ENZ resistant MR49F tumors in vivo provides only shortlived benefit in terms of slowing tumor growth [8] as well
as data from clinical trials showing that monotherapy
with Lapatinib is not effective in PCa patients [21, 33].
Taken together, these data suggest that while single agent

targeting of mechanisms of ENZ resistance may reduce
cell viability in vitro, they are not sufficient to prevent
tumor progression in vivo.
As an alternative to monotherapy, combination
therapies targeting novel signaling pathways along-side
the AR may be more viable alternatives for patients
with anti-androgen resistant PCa [28]. To investigate
this possibility, we assessed the therapeutic combination
effect of ENZ with Lapatinib on AR signaling in LNCaP

cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, combination treatment of
Lapatinib with ENZ enhanced the reduction of AR and
PSA expression (Fig. 4A) as well as AR transactivation
in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4B) more so than ENZ or Lapatinib
treatment alone. Accordingly, combination of ENZ with
Lapatinib also showed the greatest efficacy in increasing
the fraction of cells in the SubG0 phase of cell cycle (Fig.
4C) and induction of PARP cleavage (Fig. 4D) compared
to ENZ or Lapatinib alone. Moreover, combination
treatment of ENZ and Lapatinib showed the greatest
reduction in cell viability compared to monotherapy with
Lapatinib. Calculated combination indices determined at
ED50, ED75 and ED90 revealed values below 1 (Fig. 5E),
indicating ENZ and Lapatinib are strongly synergistic in
LNCaP cells. These results suggest that HER2 signaling
is important for growth and survival in the context of antiandrogen treatment and co-targeting this pathway and the
AR may have synergistic effects in CRPC.
To explore whether Lapatinib would improve
efficacy of ENZ in CRPC, LNCaP tumors were
xenografted subcutaneously into male nude/scid mice and
after castration resistant recurrence of LNCaP tumors,
mice were treated with ENZ alone, or combination
therapy of ENZ with Lapatinib. Supporting our hypothesis
that combination treatment targeting HER2 with antiandrogen may be an effective treatment for CRPC, our
results showed that adding Lapatinib treatment to ENZ
significantly reduced tumor volume compared to animals
treated with ENZ alone (Fig. 5F). Overall our in vitro and
in vivo results suggest that ENZ induced upregulation
of HER2 occurs via AKT/YB-1 signaling, leads to AR
activation and can effectively be targeted to improve
therapeutic efficacy of ENZ.

EGF signaling has been implicated in PCa
progression in a variety of reports. Activation of EGF
receptor and HER2 signaling is a known consequence
of treatment with previous generation anti-androgens
in human and mouse [29, 30] and increased expression
of EGFR or HER2 correlated with disease relapse,
progression to CRPC and poor prognosis [16, 31]. We
observed that LNCaP cells treated with the potent antiandrogen ENZ support these previous reports, with these
cells showing increased expression of HER2. Moreover,
our data in newly developed ENZR xenografts and cell
lines showing overexpression of HER2 suggested that
HER2 activity may contribute to treatment resistance,
providing support for investigating the efficacy of HER2
inhibitors after ENZ treatment and in ENZR cells. Indeed,
we found that combining Lapatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2
inhibitor, with ENZ most effectively reduced cell viability
in LNCaP cells in vitro and suppressed tumor growth vivo,
supporting previous findings showing HER2 inhibition
augments the therapeutic effect of androgen deprivation
in PCa cells [32].
AR activity is the primary source of proliferation
and survival signals in PCa tumor cells, both in primary
disease and in CRPC. Thus, we sought to determine
whether hyperactivity of HER2 in response to ENZ was
required for AR signaling. In fact, it is well known that
EGFR/HER2 signaling can constitutively activate AR and
render prostate cancer cells refractory to AR blockade
[15, 26]. Our results showing that ENZR cells, which
had the highest levels of HER2 expression, were even
more susceptible to Lapatinib treatment than LNCaP
cells support these results and suggest that ENZR cells
are dependent on HER2 mediated activation of the AR
for survival. Indeed, treatment with Lapatinib abrogated
the androgen-induced transcription and translation of
downstream AR target genes and ENZR cells were more
susceptible to Lapatinib treatment in vitro than LNCaP.
Despite these strong effects observed on ENZR cells in
vitro however, targeting growth of ENZR tumors in vivo
with Lapatinib monotherapy was not sufficient to prevent
tumor progression. This is an important finding, which
indicates that although HER2 may indeed drive further AR
activation as a mechanism of ENZ resistance, targeting this
single pathway is not effective against late stage disease
and echo previous reports showing that monotherapy
with HER2 inhibitors have been unsuccessful in PCa
[21, 33] . By contrast however, Lapatinib combination
therapy with ENZ in our model of CRPC was effective
in slowing tumor growth. This effect may be due to the
ability of combination treatment to work most efficiently
in reducing AR activity in LNCaP cells. Indeed, in
androgen stimulated LNCaP cells, combination treatment
of Lapatinib and ENZ reduced AR transactivation activity
by approximately 270 fold, whereas transactivation in
ENZR cells was only reduced by 5 fold. These results
suggest that in response to androgen deprivation, PCa cells

DISCUSSION
Overcoming treatment resistance in CRPC is
essential to improve therapy for patients who no longer
respond to even the most effective anti-androgen
treatment. Although inhibition of AR signaling will
always be a mainstay of PCa treatments, there is an
unmet clinical need to use therapies that target signaling
pathways that are induced by hormonal therapy and/
or contribute to AR re-activation in resistant disease. In
this study, we show that treatment with ENZ, the most
recently approved anti-androgen, increases activity of the
HER2 signaling pathway and hyperactivity of HER2 is
a mechanism of resistance to ENZ that can be overcome
using targeted HER2 inhibition by Lapatinib. Moreover,
we provide a mechanism for not only ENZ induced HER2
upregulation, but also HER2 control of AR signaling via
the transcription factor YB-1. These results support many
clinical findings that draw correlations between HER2 and
YB-1 expression with progression of PCa to CRPC and
provide proof-of-principle for combination therapy using
Lapatinib with ENZ in the future.

can activate the AR to promote survival and proliferation
via HER2 and that targeting this mechanism of survival
can increase efficacy of ENZ in CRPC, but not overcome
treatment resistance.
Investigation into the mechanism by which HER2
is activated by ENZ indicated the importance of the AKT/
YB-1 signaling pathway. The Y-Box binding protein 1
(YB-1) is a transcription factor that positively correlates
with HER2 expression in breast cancer [34] and lung
cancer [35]. Previous reports have shown that HER2
expression is regulated by YB-1 in breast cancer cells
[25] and that YB-1 up-regulates HER2 expression by
HER2 gene amplification [36]. Our results support the
requirement for YB-1 in mediating HER2 expression in
PCa as well, especially in androgen deprived conditions,
as we found that YB-1 bound to the HER2 promoter in
LNCaP cells and YB-1 was required for ENZ mediated
upregulation of HER2. The activation of YB-1 in our
system was induced by ENZ downstream of AKT,
supporting previously published results [37].
The correlation between increased YB-1 and
HER2 expression after ENZ treatment not only provides
a mechanism for HER2 upregulation itself, but also a
possible mechanism of AR activity regulation by HER2.
Like re-activation of the AR, YB-1 expression is closely
associated with aggressive PCa. Total and nuclear YB-1
expression in human PCa increases with Gleason Grade
and upon treatment with androgen deprivation therapy [38,
39]. In addition, our previous results indicate that YB-1 is
required for AR activation in models of CRPC [40]. These
studies in PCa support findings in other cancers where
YB-1 mediates treatment resistance [38, 41]. Based on
these data and our own presented herein, we hypothesize
that ENZ treatment initiates a feed forward loop involving
YB-1, HER2, and AR activation that contributes to
treatment resistance.
In conclusion, we have identified overexpression
of HER2 as a mechanism of resistance to the potent
anti-androgen ENZ. Our results in ENZR xenografts
and cell lines as well as LNCaP cells treated with ENZ
indicated that YB-1 and AKT are also upregulated in
response to treatment, which may contribute to HER2
mediated activation of the AR, promoting cell survival.
YB-1 was also identified as being required for HER2
upregulation, implicating a convergence of oncogenic
signaling pathways upon the AR that can mediate
treatment resistance. Most importantly, our studies in
vitro and in vivo provide proof-of-principle for the rational
combination of HER2 targeted therapy, such as Lapatinib,
with ENZ to treat CRPC and delay the emergence of
ENZR disease.

activities.

Mix (Applied Biosystems). Target gene expression was
normalized to GAPDH levels in respective samples as an
internal control.

Western blot analysis

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP
assay)

Whole-cell extracts were obtained by lysis of
cells in an appropriate volume of ice-cold RIPA buffer
composed of 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40,
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) containing 1 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Complete,
Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Nuclear and
cytoplasmic extracts were obtained using CelLyticTM
NuCLEARTM Extraction Kit (Sigma) according to
manufacturer’s protocol. Extracts were clarified by
centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 10 min and protein
concentrations of the extracts determined by a BCA
protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Extracts (30 μg)
were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and separated
by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Membranes were probed
with diluted primary antibodies followed by incubation
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies. After extensive washing, proteins were
visualized by a chemiluminescent detection system (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).

ChIP assay was performed as previously
described [9]. Briefly, LNCaP cells were cross-linked
with paraformaldehyde and digested with micrococcal
nuclease to achieve a DNA smear of 200-1000 bp. ChIP
assay was performed using SimpleChIPTM Enzymatic
Chromatin IP Kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol on the HER2 or PSA gene.
The quantitative RT-PCR assay with DNA extraction,
the primer pairs below and FastStart Universal SYBR
Master (Roche, Missassauga, ON) was performed
using ABI 7900HT System (Applied Biosystems). The
results are representative of at least three independent
experiments. The sequences of primer pairs are as
follows:
5’-AGGGGCTCCAAATAGAATGT-3’
(Fw)
and
5’-AATTTGGGAGGAGACAGTCA-3’
(Rv) for HER2 promoter targeting between –978
bp and –514 bp from transcription start site (TSS)
[43]; 5’-TCTGCCTTTGTCCCCTAGAT-3’ (Fw) and
5’-AACCTTCATTCCCCAGGACT-3’ (Rv) for PSA
ARE+ targeting between –250 bp and –39 bp from TSS;
and 5’-CTGTGCTTGGAGTTTACCTGA-3’ (Fw) and
5’-GCAGAGGTTGCAGTGAGCC-3’ (Rv) for PSA
ARE– targeting between –1997 bp and –1846 bp from
TSS.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining was conducted
using the Ventana Discover XT Autostainer (Ventana
Medical System) on paraffin embedded tumors with
enzyme labeled biotin streptavidin system and a solventresistant DAB Map kit by using HER2 antibody. Slides
were scored as follows: 0= no staining, 1= faint or focal
stain, 2= convincing intensity in a minority of cells, and
3= convincing intensity in a majority of cells. The overall
percentage of cancer cells showing staining (0%–100%)
was also indicated. Scoring was conducted at 200x.

Cell growth assay
LNCaP, MR49C and MR49F cells were plated in
96-well plates and treated with ENZ and/or Lapatinib
at indicated concentration. After incubation for 72 h,
cell growth was measured using the crystal violet assay
as described previously [44]. The combination index
(CI) was evaluated using CalcuSyn dose–effect analysis
software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). This method, based
on the multiple drug effect equation of Chou–Talalay [45],
is suitable for calculating combined drug activity over a
wide range of growth inhibition: CI ¼ 1, additivity; CI
> 1, antagonism; CI < 1, synergism. CI was calculated at
ED50 and ED75.

Luciferase reporter assay
Luciferase reporter assay was performed as
described previously [8]. Briefly, LNCaP cells were
transfected with 1.0 μg/mL of PSA reporter plasmid (PSALuc) or Probasin reporter plasmid and 0.05 μg/mL of pRLTK as an internal control. After 12 h from transfection,
media was changed to serum-free media with or without
10 nmol/L of R1881. At 12 h later, cells were further
incubated with or without 10 μmol/L of Lapatinib for 24
h. The luciferase activities were measured using a DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Flow cytometry analysis
LNCaP and MR49F and MR49C cells were plated
in 10-cm dishes and treated with ENZ and/or Lapatinib at
indicated concentration. After incubation for 48 h, cellcycle fraction was analyzed as described previously [28].

Animal treatment was performed as described
previously [28, 44]. For CRPC studies, male athymic
mice (Sprague Dawley; Harlan, Inc., Indianapolis,
IN) were injected subcutaneously with 1 x 106 LNCaP
cells (suspended in 0.1 mL Matrigel; BD Biosciences)
and castrated when serum PSA increased above 70 ng/
mL. For ENZR studies, male athymic mice (Sprague
Dawley; Harlan, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were injected
subcutaneously with 2 x 106 ENZR MR49F cells
(suspended in 0.1 mL Matrigel; BD Biosciences) under the
pressure of 10mg/kg ENZ (daily oral dose). In the CRPC
study, once tumors progressed to castrate resistance, mice
were randomly assigned to (i) vehicle, (ii) ENZ (10 mg/
kg) alone, (iii) Lapatinib (100 mg/kg) alone or (iv) ENZ
(10 mg/kg) combined with Lapatinib (100 mg/kg) and
treated orally 5 times per week. In the ENZR study, once
tumors reached 200mm3, mice were randomly assigned
to treatment with (i) vehicle or (ii) 100mg/kg Lapatinib.
Tumor volume measurements were performed weekly or
twice weekly for CRPC and ENZR studies, respectively.
Tumor volume was calculated by the formula: length x
width x depth. At experimental endpoint, tumors were
harvested and portions were snap frozen for protein
analysis or fixed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin for
IHC analysis. All animal procedures were performed
according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on
Animal Care and appropriate institutional certification.
