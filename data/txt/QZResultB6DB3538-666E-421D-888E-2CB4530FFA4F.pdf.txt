ABSTRACT
Melanoma harboring BRAF mutations frequently develop resistance to BRAF
inhibitors, limiting the impact of treatment. Here, we establish a mechanism of
resistance and subsequently identified a suitable drug combination to overcome the
resistance. Single treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines with vemurafenib
or dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitors) alone or in combination with trametinib (MEK1/2
inhibitor) resulted in overexpression of Mcl-1. Overexpression of Mcl-1 in A375
and SK-MEL-28 by transfection completely blocked BRAF and MEK1/2 inhibitormediated inhibition of cell survival and apoptosis. Melanoma cells resistant to BRAF
inhibitors showed massive expression of Mcl-1 as compared to respective sensitive
cell lines. Silencing of Mcl-1 using siRNA completely sensitized resistant melanoma
cells to growth suppression and induction of apoptosis by BRAF inhibitors. In vivo,
vemurafenib resistant A375 xenografts implanted in athymic nude mice showed
substantial tumor growth inhibition when treated with a combination of vemurafenib
and Mcl-1 inhibitor or siRNA. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses
demonstrated enhanced expression of Mcl-1 and activation of ERK1/2 in vemurafenibresistant tumors whereas level of Mcl-1 or p-ERK1/2 was diminished in the tumors
of mice treated with either of the combination. Biopsied tumors from the patients
treated with or resistant to BRAF inhibitors revealed overexpression of Mcl-1. These
results suggest that the combination of BRAF inhibitors with Mcl-1 inhibitor may
have therapeutic advantage to melanoma patients with acquired resistance to BRAF
inhibitors alone or in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors.

BRAFV600E have shown significant clinical activity in the
patients with late stage metastatic melanoma amongst
which vemurafenib has been recently approved by
US-FDA [6–8]. In spite of promising initial response,
there have been several recent reports of acquired
resistance within 6–9 months of treatment with BRAF
inhibitors in most of the patients [8, 9]. Moreover, about
20–30% patients develop squamous cell carcinoma and
more develop tumor recurrence limiting vemurafenib
therapy as well as other BRAF targeted therapies [10, 11].

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma, a malignant transformation of
melanocytes accounts for the highest number of skin
cancer related deaths with a 5-year survival probability
of less than 5% [1]. BRAF mutation is observed in almost
60% melanomas [2, 3]. Most common mutation in BRAF
is a single substitution of valine to glutamic acid at codon
600 (V600E), accounting for almost 90% BRAF mutations
in melanoma [3–5]. Selective inhibitors targeting

The ‘acquired resistance’ occurring in the tumors that were
earlier sensitive to BRAF inhibitor treatment has emerged
as a major obstacle in the treatment of the patients with
late stage metastatic melanoma with BRAFV600E mutation
leading to poor prognosis. Therefore, a combination
of BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib) and MEK1/2 inhibitor
(trametinib) was approved in early 2014 for the treatment
of metastatic melanoma, to which incidences of resistance
has already been observed [12, 13]. Hence, identification
of the mechanism behind the resistance and formulating
a drug combination to overcome resistance is of prime
importance.
Myeloid cell leukemia – 1 (Mcl-1) is pro-survival
member of Bcl-2, which is known to promote oncogenesis
not through cell proliferation but by inhibition of
apoptosis, hence leading to immortalization of malignant
cells [14, 15]. Its expression is regulated by transcription
factors like STATs, cAMP response elements and NFκB
[16]. Mcl-1 is frequently overexpressed in a variety
of human cancers thereby providing protection to the
tumor cells from apoptosis [17, 18]. Hence, Mcl-1 has
been identified as an important target in majority of
human cancers [19, 20] and several therapeutic strategies
focusing on Mcl-1 inhibition are currently under
development [21–25].
In this study, we have established that resistance to
BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib or dabrafenib alone
or in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitor (trametinib)
in melanoma cells was due to overexpression of Mcl-1.
Moreover, our results suggest that combination of BRAF
inhibitors with Mcl-1 targeted therapies were successful
in overcoming acquired resistance in melanoma in vitro
and in vivo.

upon vemurafenib treatment (Fig. 1C). We further treated
eight other melanoma cell lines with 0.4 μM vemurafenib
and observed significant upregulation of Mcl-1 in all
the cell lines (Supp Fig. 1). The fold increase in Mcl-1
expression in all the cell lines induced by single treatment
of vemurafenib is shown in Fig. 1D.
Although the viability of A375 and SK-MEL-28
cells treated with 0.4 μM vemurafenib (4XIC50) was
reduced by 60%, a remarkable increase in Mcl-1
expression was observed (Fig. 1C). These observations
were intriguing and indicated that the increase in Mcl-1
expression we observed was perhaps coming from the
remaining 40% of live attached cells that were resistant to
vemurafenib. We therefore separated attached and floating
cells after vemurafenib treatment and compared the levels
of Mcl-1 by western blotting. Our results showed that
there was a diminished expression of Mcl-1 in the dead
floating cells (Figs. 1E–1F). In contrast, cells that survived
upon vemurafenib treatment had significant upregulation
of Mcl-1 as compared to control cells indicating that
expression of Mcl-1 perhaps protected the cells from the
cytotoxic effects of vemurafenib (Figs. 1E–1F).

Mcl-1 inhibitor enhances the growth suppressive
effects of vemurafenib
Since we observed that the cells that survived
after vemurafenib treatment had significant upregulation
of Mcl-1, we wanted to see whether TW-37, a
Mcl-1 inhibitor, enhances vemurafenib mediated growth
suppression. Vemurafenib (0.4 μM) treatment reduced
the viability of A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells by 48% and
55% respectively (Figs. 1G–1H). TW-37 alone decreased
the viability of A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells by 40% and
58% respectively (Figs. 1G–1H). However, combination
of vemurafenib and TW-37 treatment reduced the cell
survival by 85% and 79%, which was significantly higher
than any of the single treatments (Figs. 1G–1H). These
observations correlated with our western blot results.
Vemurafenib failed to stimulate Mcl-1 when co-treated
with TW-37 (Figs. 1I–1J). The combination treatment
significantly induced the cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP,
which was higher than any of the individual treatments,
indicating apoptosis (Figs. 1I–1J).

RESULTS
Vemurafenib treatment induces Mcl-1 expression
in melanoma cells
To choose the working concentration, we
initially determined concentration-dependent effects of
vemurafenib using cell viability assay. We used A375
and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells, both of which harbor
BRAF mutation at V600E. The IC50 of vemurafenib in
A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells at 72 hours of treatment
were 0.1 μM and 0.075 μM respectively (Fig. 1A–1B).
Based on these results, A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells were
treated with 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 μM vemurafenib for 72 hours
(Fig. 1C). Our results showed a significant upregulation of
Mcl-1 expression upon vemurafenib treatment in both the
cell lines (Fig. 1C). Vemurafenib treatment increased the
expression of Mcl-1 by 4.7, 5.2 and 4.5 fold in A375 cells
and by 10, 11 and 14 fold in SK-MEL-28 cells at 0.1, 0.2
and 0.4 μM respectively (Fig. 1C). However, there was no
significant change in the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL

We further wanted to investigate the levels of
Mcl-1 in the cells with vemurafenib resistance. Hence, we
generated A375-VR and SK-MEL-28-VR vemurafenib
resistant cell lines. The IC50 of vemurafenib in A375-VR
and A375 X/R was 3.0 μM and 2.2 μM respectively, and
that in SK-MEL-28-VR was 3.3 μM as compared to the
IC50 of 0.1 μM and 0.075 μM in A375 and SK-MEL-28

30–40 fold resistance to vemurafenib in these cell lines.
The viability of resistant cells was not suppressed at the
concentrations that suppressed more than 60% growth
of the sensitive cell lines (Fig. 1G–1H and 2C). As
expected, western blot results showed a massive increase
in Mcl-1 expression in vemurafenib resistant cell lines
(Fig. 2B). The fold increase of Mcl-1 expression in A375VR and A375-X/R was 6.2 and 4.8 respectively, and that
in SK-MEL-28-VR was 10.1, as compared to respective
sensitive cells (Fig. 2B). Moreover, there was also a
significant increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in
all the resistant cell lines (Fig. 2B). We did not observe
any significant difference in the expression of Bcl-2 and
Bcl-XL between the wild type and resistant cell lines
(Fig. 2B).

Vemurafenib, at a concentration of 0.4 μM,
exhibited negligible effect on the survival of A375VR cells (Fig. 2C). The survival of A375-VR cells was
decreased by 25% when treated with TW-37 (Fig. 2C).
However, when these resistant cells were treated with
both TW-37 and vemurafenib, the survival of A375VR cells was decreased significantly by 80% (Fig. 2C).
Similarly, in SK-MEL-28-VR cells, vemurafenib showed
minimal effect but when combined with TW-37, the
survival of resistant cells was suppressed by about 80%
(Fig. 2C). TW-37 treatment alone reduced the growth of
SK-MEL-28-VR cells by 25% only (Fig. 2C). The enhanced

be attributed to the inhibition of Mcl-1, rendering the cells
sensitive to vemurafenib. Similar results were observed in
A375-X/R cells (Fig. 2C). These observations were further
validated by apoptosis assay. Vemurafenib treatment failed
to induce apoptosis in all the vemurafenib resistant cell
lines (Fig. 2D). There was a 2-fold increase in apoptosis
when these cells were treated with TW-37 (Fig. 2D).
Finally, when these cells were treated with a combination
of TW-37 and vemurafenib, there was more than 5-fold
increase in apoptosis (Fig. 2D). Our western blot results
showed marked expression of Mcl-1 in vemurafenib
resistant untreated cells, whereas vemurafenib treatment
further increased the expression of Mcl-1 in all the resistant
cell lines and no cleavage of caspase 3 was observed in
all the cell lines (Fig. 2E). However, vemurafenib in
combination with TW-37, which significantly inhibited
Mcl-1, increased the cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP,
indicating apoptosis (Fig. 2E). Activation of ERK1/2 was
also observed in vemurafenib resistant cell lines (Fig. 2E).
Furthermore, vemurafenib treatment did not have any
effect on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204
but when combined with TW-37, ERK1/2 phosphorylation
was suppressed (Fig. 2E). No change in the protein level
of ERK1/2 was observed by individual or combination
treatment (Fig. 2D). These results clearly indicated the role
of Mcl-1 in inducing resistance to vemurafenib in malignant
melanoma cells.

both the cell lines, which was completely diminished upon
Mcl-1 overexpression (Figs. 3C–3D).
To further establish a connection between Mcl-1
and vemurafenib resistance, we generated A375-Mcl-1+/+
and SK-MEL-28-Mcl-1+/+ cell lines exhibiting stable
overexpression of Mcl-1, and then evaluated the effect of
vemurafenib in these cell lines. As expected, these cells
behaved very similar to the resistant cells when treated
with vemurafenib. The survival of A375-Mcl-1+/+ cells
was reduced by only 20% and 25% when treated with
0.2 μM and 0.4 μM vemurafenib respectively (Fig. 3E).
In SK-MEL-28-Mcl-1+/+ cells, no change was observed
when treated with 0.2 μM vemurafenib but about 15%
reduction in cell survival was observed when treated
with 0.4 μM vemurafenib (Fig. 3E). In contrast, both
the respective wild type (parent) cell lines were highly
sensitive to vemurafenib treatment (Fig. 3E). Vemurafenib
treatment was able to induce a modest 2 fold increase in
apoptosis in both the melanoma cell lines with stable
Mcl-1 overexpression in contrast to 6 fold induction of
apoptosis in the respective parent cell lines (Fig. 3F).
These results established the involvement of Mcl-1 in
the induction of acquired resistance to vemurafenib in
melanoma cells.

Silencing Mcl-1 reverses vemurafenib resistance
To examine whether silencing Mcl-1 could
overcome vemurafenib resistance in melanoma cells,
Mcl-1 was silenced using two different siRNAs, which
were denoted as siRNA#1 and siRNA#2. The sequences
of siRNAs are given in Supplemental Table 1. We first
tested the effect of Mcl-1 silencing in A375-Mcl-1+/+
and SK-MEL-28-Mcl-1+/+ cells, since the response of
these cells to vemurafenib was analogous to the resistant
cell lines (A375-VR and SK-MEL-28-VR). Almost
100% silencing of Mcl-1 was achieved with both the
siRNAs in both the Mcl-1 overexpressing cell lines
(Fig. 4C). As mentioned above, vemurafenib treatment
had very minimal effect on A375-Mcl-1+/+ cells whereas
SK-MEL-28-Mcl-1+/+ cells were completely resistant
(Fig. 4A). However, upon silencing of Mcl-1by siRNA#1
or siRNA#2, vemurafenib suppressed the survival of
A375-Mcl-1+/+ cells by 73% and that of SK-MEL-28Mcl-1+/+ cells by 70% (Fig. 4A). Likewise, combination
of vemurafenib with Mcl-1 siRNA#1 and Mcl-1 siRNA#2
induced 5 fold apoptosis in both the Mcl-1 overexpressing
cell lines (Fig. 4B). These observations were further
supported by our western blot results. With vemurafenib
treatment, there was no change in the cleavage of caspase
3 and PARP as compared to control in both the Mcl-1 +/+
cell lines (Fig. 4C). However, when Mcl-1 was silenced
and the cells were treated with vemurafenib, significant
apoptosis was induced as depicted by cleavage of caspase
3 and PARP (Fig. 4C).

Mcl-1 overexpression reduce the sensitivity of
melanoma cells to vemurafenib
To further characterize the role of Mcl-1 in
vemurafenib resistance, we overexpressed Mcl-1 in
A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells by transfecting the cells with
Mcl-1 overexpressing plasmid. The survival of A375 cells
was reduced by about 55% and 75% and SK-MEL-28
cells by 57% and 67%, when treated with 0.2 μM and
0.4  μM vemurafenib respectively (Fig. 3A). However,
upon Mcl-1 overexpression, the effect of vemurafenib
was significantly reduced in both the cell lines (Fig. 3A).
For example, the survival of Mcl-1 overexpressing A375
was reduced merely by 18% and 24% when treated
with 0.2 μM and 0.4 μM of vemurafenib respectively
(Fig. 3A). Similarly, SK-MEL-28 cells overexpressing
Mcl-1 were completely resistant when treated with
0.2  μM vemurafenib whereas 0.4 μM reduced the
survival of cells by only 18% (Fig. 3A). We also tested
the effect of Mcl-1 overexpression on apoptosis induced
by vemurafenib. There was about 4-fold induction of
apoptosis when A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells were treated
with vemurafenib (Fig. 3B). Upon Mcl-1 overexpression,
the apoptosis induced by vemurafenib was completely
abrogated (Fig. 3B). These results were further supported
by our western blot results. Upon vemurafenib treatment,
there was a marked cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP in

Next, we sought to determine the effect of
vemurafenib in A375-VR, A375-X/R and SK-MEL-28VR cells after silencing Mcl-1, as these cells expressed
very high levels of Mcl-1. About 85–95% Mcl-1 silencing
was achieved by both the siRNAs in all the resistant cell
lines (Fig. 4F–4G). Upon Mcl-1 silencing, there was a
significant reduction in cell survival in all the resistant
cell lines when treated with vemurafenib. The survival
of A375-VR, A375-X/R and SK-MEL-28-VR cells
when treated with vemurafenib was decreased by 65%,
75% and 55% respectively when Mcl-1 was silenced in
these resistant cells (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the sensitivity

of Mcl-1 silenced resistant cells to vemurafenib was
very similar to that of parent (sensitive) cells that
we observed earlier (Fig. 1A–1B). Additionally, the
combination of vemurafenib and Mcl-1 siRNA#1 or
Mcl-1 siRNA#2 induced 5-fold apoptosis in all the
resistant cell lines, which were initially unresponsive
to vemurafenib treatment (Fig. 4E). These results were
further supported by western blotting data (Fig. 4F–4G).
Vemurafenib treatment induced very minimal cleavage of
caspase 3 and PARP in resistant cell lines (Fig. 4F–4G).
Nonetheless, treatment of cells with vemurafenib after
silencing of Mcl-1 induced notable cleavage of caspase

treatment did not have any effect on p-ERK1/2 but
when combined with Mcl-1 siRNA, phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 was significantly suppressed (Fig. 4F–4G). The
exact mechanism by which Mcl-1 inhibition regulates
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in our model is not clear
and requires further investigation. The expression of

was 870 ± 187.8 mm3 demonstrating a 48% and 46%
reduction in tumor growths as compared to the tumor
volumes of the mice from control as well as vemurafenib
treated group, respectively (Fig. 5A). Most importantly,
mice that were treated with a combination of vemurafenib
and TW-37 had significantly lower tumor volumes as
compared to all the three groups (Fig. 5A). The average
tumor volumes of these mice at the end of the experiment
were 215.3 ± 51.6 mm3, showing a marked reduction in
tumor growth by more than 85% as compared to control
or vemurafenib treated group (Fig. 5A). In fact, the
tumors did not grow much once the treatment started.
The average tumor volume of the mice that
were treated with Mcl-1 siRNA alone at the end of the
experiment was 875 ± 134.3 mm3, which was significantly
lower than that of control and vemurafenib treated mice
(Fig. 6A). The average tumor volume of the mice treated
with scrambled siRNA was 1553 ± 650 mm3, showing
no significant difference between the average volumes
of the tumor of the mice treated with scrambled siRNA,
vemurafenib or control mice (Fig. 6A). However, the
average volume of the tumors in the mice that were treated
with vemurafenib and Mcl-1 siRNA was 292 ± 48.12 mm3,

melanoma tumors resistant to vemurafenib
Although it was very evident from our in vitro
results that inhibition of Mcl-1 completely reversed the
acquired resistance to vemurafenib in melanoma cells, it
was of utmost importance to translate these observations
in vivo. At day 30, the average tumor volume of the

than 80%, as compared to control or vemurafenib treated
group (Fig. 6A).
At day 30, mice from all the groups were sacrificed
and the tumors were removed and weighed. As shown in
Fig. 5B, there was no difference in the tumor weight of
control and vemurafenib treated mice. The weight of the
tumor in TW-37 treated group was reduced by 47% as
compared to control and 48% as compared to vemurafenib
treated group (Fig. 5B). Notably, the tumor weight in the
mice treated with TW-37 and vemurafenib was reduced
by more than 85%, consistent with tumor volume data.
The weight of the tumor in Mcl-1 siRNA treated group
was reduced by 40% as compared to control and 43%
as compared to vemurafenib treated group (Fig. 6B).
Moreover, the tumor weight in the mice treated with
Mcl-1 siRNA and vemurafenib was reduced by more
than 85%, consistent with tumor volume data (Fig. 6B).
These results clearly indicated that Mcl-1 overexpression
led to vemurafenib resistance and that inhibition of
Mcl-1 sensitized the vemurafenib resistant tumors to
vemurafenib.

on p-ERK1/2 expression (Fig. 5 and 6C–6D). However,
upon combining vemurafenib with either Mcl-1 inhibitor
or Mcl-1 siRNA, there was a substantial decrease in
the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, hence, indicating the
inhibition of MAPK pathway (Fig. 5 and 6C–6D).
Nevertheless, the expression of ERK1/2 was not changed
by any of the treatments (Fig. 5C and 6C). Finally, TUNEL
staining exhibited significant staining in the tumors of the
mice that were treated with a combination of vemurafenib
and Mcl-1 inhibitor/siRNA, indicating apoptosis (Fig. 5D
and 6D). Tumors from the mice treated with vemurafenib
showed negligible or no TUNEL staining, which was
similar to the tumors from control mice (Fig. 5D and 6D).

Dabrafenib induces Mcl-1 expression in
melanoma cells
While we were working with vemurafenib,
dabrafenib, another BRAF inhibitor was approved for the
treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma. Hence, we wanted
to see whether the role of Mcl-1 in drug resistance was
specific to vemurafenib or applicable to other BRAF
inhibitors as well. We treated A375, SK-MEL-28,
WM239 and SK-MEL-5 cells with 2.5, 5 and 10 nM
dabrafenib for 72 hours. Similar to vemurafenib, we
observed that dabrafenib treatment also induced massive
Mcl-1 expression at all the three concentrations (Fig. 7A).
We then generated dabrafenib resistant A375, SK-MEL-28
and WM-239 cells, which were denoted as A375-DR,
SK-MEL-28-DR and WM-239-DR. The IC50 of dabrafenib
in A375, SK-MEL-28 and WM-239 was 5nM, 2nM and
6nM respectively, and that of A375-DR, SK-MEL-28DR and WM-239-DR was greater than 100 nM indicating
more than 30-fold resistance (Fig. 7B). As expected,
dabrafenib resistant melanoma cells showed marked
upregulation of Mcl-1 as compared to the respective wild
type (sensitive) cells (Fig. 7C). The fold-increase in Mcl-1
expression in A375-DR, SK-MEL-28-DR and WM-239DR was 14.2, 19.4 and 12.9 respectively (Fig. 7C).

Vemurafenib resistant tumors exhibit
overexpression of Mcl-1
Upon termination of in vivo experiments,
tumors were examined by western blotting and
immunohistochemistry. The control tumors showed marked
expression of Mcl-1 (Fig. 5 and 6C–6D). Interestingly,
tumors from vemurafenib treated group had even higher
expression of Mcl-1 than the tumors from control group
(Fig. 5 and 6C–6D). The tumors from the mice that were
treated with either Mcl-1 inhibitor (Fig. 5C–5D) or Mcl-1
siRNA alone (Fig. 6C–6D) had diminished expression
of Mcl-1. Nonetheless, the tumors from the mice that
were treated with a combination of vemurafenib with
either Mcl-1 inhibitor or Mcl-1 siRNA had significantly
lower expression of Mcl-1 as compared to the tumors
from control or vemurafenib treated group (Fig. 5C–5D).
We also examined the expression of cleaved caspase 3,
cleaved PARP and p-ERK1/2 in these tumors. Tumors
from control and vemurafenib group showed minimal
cleavage of caspase 3 or PARP (Fig. 5 and 6C–6D).
The tumors treated with Mcl-1 inhibitor or Mcl-1
siRNA showed modest cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP
(Fig. 5 and 6C–6D). However, the tumors that were
treated with the combination of vemurafenib with Mcl-1
inhibitor or Mcl-1 siRNA showed massive cleavage
of caspase3 and PARP. Expression of p-ERK1/2 was
evaluated to check the inhibition of MAPK pathway.
In control and vemurafenib treated group, where there
was high expression of Mcl-1, we also observed notable
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 5 and 6C–6D). Treatment
with Mcl-1 inhibitor or Mcl-1 siRNA had minimal effect

Dabrafenib-Trametinib combination induces
Mcl-1 expression in melanoma cells
Early 2014, FDA approved a combination of BRAF
inhibitor (dabrafenib) and MEK1/2 inhibitor (trametinib)
for the treatment of late stage malignant melanoma, due
to ineffectiveness of vemurafenib monotherapy. Hence,
we wanted to know whether the role of Mcl-1 in drug
resistance was specific to BRAF inhibitors or applicable to
the combination of BRAF and MEK1/2 inhibitors as well.
We treated the cells with BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib or
vemurafenib) and MEK 1/2 inhibitor (trametinib) alone
as well as in combination. As observed earlier, dabrafenib
at a concentration of 10 nM significantly induced the
expression of Mcl-1 in A375, SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-5

cells with a combination of vemurafenib or dabrafenib
with trametinib also caused remarkable induction of Mcl1 which was more as compared to individual treatments
(Fig. 8A–8B). Induction of Mcl-1 by treatment with a

expression of Mcl-1 (Fig. 10A). Furthermore, progression
biopsy revealed enhanced expression of Mcl-1 as
compared to the pretreated tumors from the same patient
(Fig. 10B). Hence, these results showed that treatment
with BRAF inhibitor alone or in combination with
MEK1/2 inhibitor caused Mcl-1 overexpression, which
correlated with relative resistance.

of Mcl-1 is promoted by various transcription factors
like STATs, cAMP response elements and NFκB [16].
Recent studies have correlated the activation of Src and
STAT-3 with vemurafenib resistance [30, 31]. Both these
pathways can directly or indirectly stimulate Mcl-1
expression. Moreover, activation of other unknown
pathways may also cause induction of Mcl-1 expression.
Nonetheless, targeting upstream molecules may provide
little benefit to overcome vemurafenib resistance as
compared to targeting Mcl-1 directly, as Mcl-1 is the
ultimate downstream molecule and directly responsible
for causing resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Additionally,
targeting upstream molecules for therapy often fails as the
intermediary molecules often get mutated or influenced
by cross talk with other survival pathways resulting in the
ineffectiveness of therapy [32–34].
Our studies provided several in vitro and in vivo
evidences to prove this and established Mcl-1 as the
major culprit in inducing resistance to BRAF inhibitors in
melanoma. Wild type A375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma
cells completely lost sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors alone
or in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors upon Mcl-1
overexpression and transformed them into resistant cells.
The involvement of Mcl-1 in resistance to BRAF
inhibitors was strengthened when vemurafenib resistant
A375-VR or SK-MEL-28-VR cells were treated with the
combination of vemurafenib with TW-37 (Mcl-1 inhibitor)
or Mcl-1 siRNAs, and the combination treatment markedly
induced apoptosis in both the cell lines which were
earlier resistant to vemurafenib treatment. Moreover, the
combination of vemurafenib with TW-37 or Mcl-1 siRNA
dramatically inhibited the growth of A375-VR tumors,
which exhibited complete resistance to vemurafenib
treatment. Surprisingly, even though TW-37 or Mcl-1
siRNA did not have any effect on the phosphorylation
of ERK1/2, their combination with vemurafenib led to

DISCUSSION
All the melanoma cell lines tested in the present
study were highly sensitive to the treatment with BRAF
inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) alone or in
combination with MEK1/2 inhibitor (trametinib). In spite
of this, it was surprising to see a significant upregulation
of Mcl-1 in the surviving cells following a single
treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Our previous study did
not observe any significant change in the expression of
Mcl-1 with BRAF inhibitor treatment [26]. However, the
expression of Mcl-1 in aforementioned study was tested
only after 24 hours of treatment in contrast to 72 hours
treatment in the current study. This suggests that Mcl-1
expression was induced upon longer duration of treatment.
Moreover, the dead floating cells which responded to
vemurafenib treatment had diminished Mcl-1 expression,
consistent with previous reports indicating that inhibition
of oncogenic BRAF led to inhibition of Mcl-1 [27–29].
Subsequently, in the current study, the cells resistant to
BRAF inhibitors exhibited enhanced expression of Mcl-1.
This provided initial evidence that overexpression of Mcl1 might be responsible for acquired resistance to BRAF
inhibitors in melanoma cells.
Induction of Mcl-1 with the treatment with BRAF
inhibitors may indicate activation of other pathways post
treatment leading to upregulation of Mcl-1. Expression

is that patients with high Mcl-1 expression exists, either
at baseline or by BRAF inhibitors, and these patients will
be less likely to benefit from such a combination. Next
important step is to develop clinical assay to measure
Mcl-1 expression, so that patients likely to benefit from
non-Mcl-1 targeting BH3 mimetics could be identified,
ideally prior to therapy or early after the commencement
of therapy. Beyond that, as the clinical development of
Mcl-1 inhibitors proceed, an early look at combinations
with BRAF targeted therapy will be critical.
Taken together, our results conclusively established
that overexpression of Mcl-1 was responsible for the
resistance to BRAF inhibitors; the process mediated by
BRAF inhibitors itself. Mcl-1 targeted therapies will have
significant impact on the patients with melanoma tumors
refractory to BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination
with MEK1/2 inhibitor. Although, currently there is no
FDA approved Mcl-1 inhibitor, the process to discover
clinically useful Mcl-1 inhibitors has well begun [24, 25,
44, 45]. Our laboratory is also aggressively working on
developing novel Mcl-1 inhibitors as drugs.

decrease in the levels of p-ERK1/2. This may indicate
that in presence of Mcl-1 inhibitor, vemurafenib was
effectively controlling the MAPK pathway. However, the
exact mechanism by which phosphorylation of ERK1/2
was suppressed require further investigation.
TW-37 is a BH-3 mimetic which binds to Mcl1 and Bcl-2 with a Ki of 260 and 290 nM respectively
and consequently induces caspase activity. TW-37 binds
to Bcl-XL with a 5 fold lower affinity (Ki≈1200 nM)
[35, 36]. Therefore, in order to inhibit Bcl-XL, cells should
be treated with at least 5 fold higher concentration of TW37 as compared to that used in the current study, sufficient
to inhibit Mcl-1 but not Bcl-XL [37]. We observed that
treatment of melanoma cells with BRAF inhibitors did
not induce Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, there was no
difference in the expression of Bcl-2 between the wild type
and resistant melanoma cells. Besides, previous studies
have shown reduced expression of Bcl-2 in melanoma as
compared to melanocytes and benign nevi [38–42], ruling
out the involvement of Bcl-2 in our study. Furthermore, the
concentrations of TW-37 used for this study were not able
to inhibit the expression of Bcl-XL in vivo (Supplemental
Fig. 3). These factors somewhat eliminated the involvement
of other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins. More
importantly, the in vitro and in vivo observations were
confirmed by using Mcl-1 siRNA along with vemurafenib
treatment, which further ruled out the involvement of other
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. In fact, two Mcl-1
siRNAs with different sequences were used to ensure target
specificity and to eliminate off-target actions.
Finally, highly elevated expression of Mcl-1
in the biopsy samples obtained from the patients that
were treated with or resistant to BRAF inhibitors like
vemurafenib or dabrafenib alone or in combination with
MEK1/2 inhibitor (trametinib) further confirmed that
Mcl-1 may be responsible for induction of resistance to
the entire class of BRAF inhibitors.
The translational consequences of these findings
are significant. Our results conclusively establish that
overexpression of Mcl-1 is critical for melanoma cell
survival in the setting of BRAF inhibitor treatment and
induce clinical resistance to BRAF inhibitors. To date,
Mcl-1 targeted therapies have not been well established in
the clinic, however based on this work and others, Mcl-1
is an obviously high valued target in oncology. Instead,
the major so-called BH3-mimetics that are in clinical
trials are those that inhibit Bcl-2 quite selectively (ABT199) or more broadly (navitoclax, ABT-737), though even
navitoclax only selectively inhibits Bcl-2, Bcl-x, Bcl-w
and does not have any activity against Mcl-1. Due to the
exciting preclinical data with Bcl2/Bcl-x inhibitors in
combination with single-agent BRAF inhibitors [26, 43],
combined BRAF targeted therapy with navitoclax as part
of a CTEP study (P9466, NCT01989585) has commenced.
Still, the prediction from our current and previous work

Generation of BRAF-inhibitor resistant cell lines

Mcl-1 overexpression

Vemurafenib resistant clones of A375 and SKMEL-28 were generated by continuous exposure of cells
to escalating concentrations of vemurafenib over a period
of one year. The cells were treated with vemurafenib for
72 hours after which fresh media was added to the cells.
The cells were allowed to recover for 24 hours after
which they were again exposed to vemurafenib as shown
in Supp. Tables 2–3. In all, cells were exposed weekly to
two treatments of vemurafenib for 72 hours each with a
24 hour recovery period between the treatments. The
initial concentration of vemurafenib used was 0.2 μM
which was eventually increased to as high as 10 μM.
Similarly, dabrafenib resistant cells were cultured by
incubating the cells with increasing concentrations of the
drug for a period of 3 months as described above. The fold
resistance was intermittently evaluated by cell viability
assay. Vemurafenib resistant cell lines were referred to
as SK-MEL-28-VR or A375-VR and dabrafenib resistant
cell lines were referred to as A375-DR, SK-MEL-28-DR
or WM-239-DR. Another resistant cell line was generated
from A375 xenograft-resistant (A375 X/R) tumors. Here,
A375-VR cells were injected subcutaneously in nude
mice. When palpable tumors were formed, the mice
were orally treated with 30 mg/kg vemurafenib twice a
day. After 30 days of treatment, cells from the tumors of
mice treated with vemurafenib were isolated and cultured
in vitro. These cells were named as A375 X/R cells.

A375 or SK-MEL-28 cells were transiently or
stably transfected with plasmid overexpressing Mcl-1 by
nucleofection kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) according
to manufacturer’s protocol and previously described by us
[49]. Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were suspended in a reaction
mixture from the kit specific to the cell line (Kit V for
A375 and Kit R for SK-MEL-28 cells). The cells were
transferred to the cuvettes and electroporated using the
nucleofector instrument (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany).
To achieve stable overexpression, after transfection, cells
were exposed to puromycin with an initial concentration
of 1 μg/ml, which was gradually increased to 5 μg/ml. The
resistant colonies were picked by colony picking cylinder
and were cultured in presence of puromycin (5 μg/ml).
Stable overexpression of Mcl-1 was intermittently tested
by western blotting. A375 or SK-MEL-28 cells with stable
overexpression of Mcl-1 were denoted as A375-Mcl-1+/+
or SK-MEL-28-Mcl-1+/+ respectively.

Mcl-1 silencing
Silencing of Mcl-1 was achieved according to the
protocol described by us previously [50]. Briefly, 0.3 × 106
cells were plated in OPTI-MEM without antibiotics and
transfected with Mcl-1 siRNA#1, Mcl-1 siRNA#2 or
scrambled siRNA. Complexes were prepared by incubating
10nM siRNA with 8 μl siPORT transfection reagent in
200 μl OPTI-MEM media without serum or antibiotic for
20 minutes. These complexes were then added to the cells.
Six hours after transfection, complexes were replaced with
fresh medium.

Cytotoxicity analysis
SK-MEL-28, A375, WM-239, SK-MEL-28-VR,
A375-VR, A375-X/R, A375-DR, SK-MEL-28-DR and
WM-239-DR cells were treated with various concentrations
of vemurafenib or dabrafenib and cytotoxicity was
performed by SRB assay as previously described by us
[46, 47].

Tumor therapy
All the experiments involving animals were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
About 5–6 weeks old athymic nude mice (Charles River,
Wilmington, MA, USA) were allowed to acclimatize for
one week prior to the beginning of the experiments. Mice
were injected subcutaneously with 3.5 × 106 A375-VR cells.
When the tumor volume reached to 150 mm3, mice were
randomly segregated into several groups with 6–7 mice in
each group. Vemurafenib, formulated as microprecipitated
bulk powder (MBP) was suspended at a desired
concentration in a vehicle containing 2% Klucel LF and
adjusted to pH 4 with HCl, was given at a dose of 25 mg/
kg twice a day through oral gavage. TW-37 in PBS/ethanol/
Tween 80 was administered intraperitonially at a dose of 30
mg/kg thrice a week. Mcl-1 (0.2 nmol) or scrambled siRNA
was administered twice a week directly into the tumors
(intra-tumoral injection) as described by us previously [50].
Tumor measurements were taken thrice a week by vernier
calipers and the volume was calculated by the formula
V = length * (breadth)2/2 as previously described [51–53].

Apoptosis assay
Annexin V/FITC assay was perform by flow
cytometry after TW-37 treatments, Mcl-1 overexpression
or Mcl-1 silencing according to manufacturer’s protocol
(BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) as previously
described by us [48].

TW-37 treatment
SK-MEL-28, A375, SK-MEL-28-VR, A375-VR
and A375-X/R were plated in a six-well plate at a density
of 0.3 × 106 cells/well and left overnight to attach. Next
day, cells were treated with 500nM TW-37 for one hour
followed by treatment with 0.4 μM vemurafenib for
72 hours. Cells were collected and processed for SRB
assay, apoptosis assay or western blotting.

We would like to thank Dr. Tyler Wakenda,
Rochester University, NY for providing us A375 cells and
Dr. Randy Burd, University of Arizona, AZ for providing
us SK-MEL-5 cells.

At the end of the experiment, animals were euthanized
humanely and tumors were excised and fixed in formalin
for immunohistochemistry or flash frozen in liquid nitrogen
for western blot analysis as described previously by us [54].

Immumnohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed according to
the protocol previously described by us [55]. Expression of
Mcl-1, cleaved caspase 3 and p-ERK1/2 in tumor samples
were analyzed in paraffin sections obtained from five mice
from each group. The sections were deparaffinized and
rehydrated using decreasing concentrations of ethanol.
Antigen retrieval process was carried out by boiling
the sections in citrate buffer (pH 6) for 10 minutes.
Endogenous peroxides were quenched by incubating
the sections in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Sections
were blocked using 6% goat serum for 30 minutes after
which they were exposed to primary antibody overnight.
Following the incubation, the expression was detected
using Ultravision ONE detection reagent (Thermo
Fisher, Houston, TX) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The sections were then counterstained with
Mayer’s hematoxylin and dehydrated using increasing
concentrations of ethanol and xylene and observed under
the microscope (Olympus).TUNEL assay was carried out
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Patient samples
Patients with metastatic melanoma containing
BRAF V600E mutation (confirmed by genotyping) were
consented for tissue acquisition per IRB-approved protocol
covered under DF/HCC protocol number 11–181. Tumor
biopsies were performed pre-treatment (day 0) 10–14 days
after treatment initiation (on treatment) and upon evidence
of resistance to therapy (progression). Formalin-fixed
tissue was analyzed to confirm that viable tumor was
present via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.

Statistical analysis
All the statistical analysis was performed using
Prism 6.0 (Graph Pad software Inc., San Diego, CA,
USA). In vitro data was plotted as mean ± S.D. of at least
three independent experiments and in vivo data was plotted
as mean ± S.E.M. Data was analyzed by Student’s t-test or
one way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc analysis
for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered
statistically significant at P < 0.05.
