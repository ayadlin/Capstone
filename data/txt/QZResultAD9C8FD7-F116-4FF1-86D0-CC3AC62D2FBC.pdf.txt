ABSTRACT
Background: Recent evidence suggests a critical role of hyaluronan (HA),
especially low-molecular-weight HA (LMW-HA), in the aggressive tumor phenotype.
Increased expression of KIAA1199, a newly identified protein involved in HA
degradation, has been reported in various cancers, including pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, little is known about the functional significance
of KIAA1199 in PDAC.
Methods: Using siRNA knockdown and forced expression models, we investigated
the effects of KIAA1199 expression on malignant behaviors (proliferation, migration,
and invasion) of PDAC cells. We also examined the effect of inflammation on the
transcriptional regulation of KIAA1199 using a pro-inflammatory cytokine and antiinflammatory agent.
Results: Knockdown of KIAA1199 expression using siRNA resulted in decreased
cell migration and proliferation. On the other hand, forced expression of KIAA1199
using gene transduction significantly enhanced the migration and invasion.
Importantly, increased KIAA1199 expression was associated with an increased level
of LMW-HA in the conditioned medium. Exposure to a pro-inflammatory cytokine,
interleukin-1ß, increased the KIAA1199 transcription and enhanced the migration.
In contrast, treatment with NS-398, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, decreased the
KIAA1199 expression and inhibited the migration.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that increased KIAA1199 expression
may contribute to the aggressive phenotype partly through increasing the LMWHA concentration. Our present results also suggest a possible link between
inflammation, induced KIAA1199 expression, and enhanced migration during PDAC
progression.

tumor phenotype is important to develop novel therapeutic
strategies and improve survival of patients with PDAC.
Recently, the study focus in the field of PDAC
research has shifted from cancer cells themselves
to their surrounding microenvironment. PDAC is
characterized by a dense stroma consisting of various
stromal cells (including inflammatory cells, stellate
cells, and activated fibroblasts) embedded within rich
extracellular matrix (ECM) [2]. Hyaluronan (HA), a
major component of ECM, is abundantly accumulated
in a wide range of cancers including PDAC and plays a
critical role in a variety of cellular processes including

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one
of the most aggressive neoplasms ranking the fourth
among cancer-related deaths in western countries. The
prognosis of patients with PDAC remains dismal with the
overall 5-year survival rate of less than 5% [1]. One major
reason responsible for this extremely poor prognosis in
PDAC is related to its rapid invasion to the surrounding
structures and metastatic spread to the lymph nodes and
distant organs. Therefore, understanding the biological
and molecular mechanisms underlying this aggressive

cell proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis,
angiogenesis, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents
[3-8]. Interestingly, low-molecular-weight HA (LMWHA) or small HA fragments, rather than high-molecularweight HA (HMW-HA), has been suggested to be
essential for cancer progression in terms of invasion
and metastasis [9, 10]. We also show that LMW-HA
stimulates motility of PDAC cells [11]. HA, a large
linear glycosaminoglycan of up to 106-107 Da in its naïve
form, is produced by HA-synthesizing enzymes (HASs)
and degraded into smaller fragments by hyaluronidases
(HYALs). We previously demonstrated overexpression
of HAS2 (one of the major HA-synthesizing proteins) in
PDAC [12]. In addition to the HA synthesis, degradation
of HA by HYAL is also accelerated in malignant tumors.
In our previous study, HYAL1 has been shown to be
overexpressed in PDAC [13]. Because of the important
role of LMW-HA in the malignant phenotype, other
mechanisms for HA degradation are likely to exist
independent of HYALs.
KIAA1199 is a gene originally identified in relation
with non-syndromic hearing loss [14]. Previous studies
suggests that KIAA1199 (also termed as CEMIP) is
overexpressed, prognostic, and correlated with the
malignant behavior in a variety of cancers [15-21].
Recently, KIAA1199 was found to have an ability
to degrade HA independent of HYAL activities [22],
suggesting a possible linkage between KIAA1199
expression, HA degradation, and cancer progression.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the
functional significance of KIAA1199 in PDAC. We also
examined the effect of inflammation on the KIAA1199
expression and migration of PDAC cells. Our present
results suggest that KIAA1199 plays an important role in
the aggressive tumor phenotype in PDAC partly through
accelerating the process of HA degradation.

examined whether KIAA1199 knockdown affected PDAC
cell proliferation. The MTT assay showed the knockdown
of KIAA1199 significantly decreased the proliferation of
PDAC cells as compared to control on day3 and day 5
(P<0.05; Figure 1D).

Upregulation of KIAA1199 expression increased
migration, invasion and LMW-HA in PDAC cells
We next used an expression vector to examine the
forced expression of KIAA1199 in PANC-1 with low
expression level (Figure 1A). We transfected KIAA1199
expression vector (KIAA1199-clone1, KIAA1199clone2) or an empty vector control into PANC-1 and
stable transfectants were established under selection with
G418. The KIAA1199 mRNA and protein expression
were examined by real-time RT-PCR and western blot
analysis, respectively. As expected, the KIAA1199 mRNA
expression was higher in the KIAA1199-clone1 and
KIAA1199-clone2 (with a maximum of approximately
11-fold) as compared to the empty vector control (Figure
2A). KIAA1199 protein expression was also higher in the
KIAA1199-clone1 and KIAA1199-clone2 as compared to
control (Figure 2A).
We then compared abilities for migration and
invasion between KIAA1199-clones and control. The
transwell migration assay showed that forced expression
of KIAA1199 significantly enhanced the migration of
PDAC cells (P=0.005 for KIAA1199-clone1, P=0.015
for KIAA1199-clone2 as compared to control; Figure
2B). Invasion assay showed that forced expression
of KIAA1199 significantly enhanced the invasion of
PDAC cells (P=0.001 for KIAA1199-clone1, P<0.001
for KIAA1199-clone2 as compared to control; Figure
2C). We also examined whether overexpression of
KIAA1199 affected PDAC cell proliferation. However,
there was no significant difference in cell proliferation
between KIAA1199 clones and control cells (date not
shown).
Because KIAA1199 is involved in HA degradation,
we measured the concentration of LMW-HA (<100 kDa)
in the conditioned media in these cells. The concentrations
of LMW-HA were significantly higher in KIAA1199clones relative to the control (P<0.05; Figure 2D).

RESULTS
Knockdown of KIAA1199 expression decreased
migration and proliferation in PDAC cells
In the present study, we used two PDAC cell
lines with high and low KIAA1199 mRNA expression
(as compared to a control cell line HPDE) (Figure 1A).
First, we used siRNA to knockdown the expression of
KIAA1199 in BxPC-3 with high KIAA1199 mRNA
expression (Figure 1A). Real-time RT-PCR showed that
transfection with siRNA targeting for KIAA1199 (siRNAKIAA1199) resulted in 73% knockdown (Figure 1B).
First, we investigated whether KIAA1199 affected
cell migration. The transwell migration assay showed
that knockdown of KIAA1199 significantly inhibited the
migration of PDAC cells as compared to control (nontarget siRNA transfection) (P<0.001; Figure 1C). Next, we

Effects of inflammation on KIAA1199 expression
and migration
Because inflammation is a key factor promoting
cancer initiation and progression, we thought to determine
the effects of inflammation on the KIAA1199 expression
in PDAC cells. First, we used a pro-inflammatory cytokine
interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) to induce inflammation. Exposure
of PANC-1 cells with IL-1ß at 500 pg/ml for 48 hours
robustly increased the expression of KIAA1199 (6.3-fold
increase, Figure 3A).

We also examined the effect of IL-1ß on migration
in PANC-1. Exposure to IL-1ß significantly increased the
number of migrating cells (P<0.001; Figure 3B).
We
used
an
anti-inflammatory
drug
(cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, NS-398) to further
examine the effect of inflammation on the KIAA1199
expression in another PDAC cell line BxPC-3. Treatment
with NS-398 decreased the expression of KIAA1199
mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A). We also
examined the effect of NS-398 on migration in BxPC-3.
The transwell migration assay at 24 hours after treatment

(when there was no significant difference in the number
of cells) showed that NS-398 inhibited the migration of
BxPC-3 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4B).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we investigated the effects
of KIAA1199 expression on the malignant phenotype
of PDAC cells by modulating its expression level. The
major findings obtained were as follows: (1) knockdown
of KIAA1199 resulted in decreased proliferation and

migration in BxPC-3; (2) forced expression of KIAA1199
resulted in increased migration and invasion in PANC-1;
(3) increased expression of KIAA1199 was associated
with an elevated level of LMW-HA; and (4) KIAA1199
expression and migratory ability were increased in
response to a pro-inflammatory stimulus but decreased
by treatment with an anti-inflammatory drug. These
findings suggest that KIAA1199, which can be induced by

inflammation, may contribute to the malignant phenotype
in PDAC cells partly through increasing the LMW-HA
level.
The exact mechanisms by which KIAA1199
accelerates cancer progression remain undermined.
However, functional studies have revealed a number of
cancer-promoting effects of KIAA1199. For example,
KIAA1199 is known to increase the migration of

transfected KIAA1199 expression vector (KIAA1199-clone1, KIAA1199-clone2) or an empty vector control into PANC-1 and stable
transfectants were established under selection with G418. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis validated the successful transfection
and the expression of KIAA1199 mRNA and protein were upregulated in KIAA1199-clone1 and KIAA1199-clone2. B. The transwell
migration assay showed that forced expression of KIAA1199 significantly stimulated the migration of PDAC cells as compared to control
(P=0.005 for KIAA1199-clone1, P=0.015 for KIAA1199-clone2). C. Invasion assay showed forced expression of KIAA1199 significantly

cancer cells partly through mediating endoplasmic
reticulum calcium leakage, which results in protein
kinase Cα activation [23]. Previous studies have shown
that KIAA1199 promotes EMT, which is associated
with a more aggressive phenotype in various cancers
[23]. KIAA1199 promotes cancer cell survival through
EGFR signaling [24] and through promoting glycogen
breakdown and preventing apoptosis [25]. The shRNAmediated knockdown of KIAA1199 in breast cancer cells
resulted in reduced cell motility and proliferation in vitro

and decreased tumor growth in mice [15]. Geneticallyengineered knockout of KIAA1199 reduces the ability of
colon cancer cells to form xenograft tumors in athymic
mice [19]. In the present study, we demonstrate that
KIAA1199 enhances the malignant behaviors of PDAC
cells in associated with an increased level of LMW-HA.
Although further studies are required, our results suggest
that KIAA1199 may contribute to the aggressive tumor
phenotype through accelerating the HA degradation and
producing a larger amount of LMW-HA.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR

Factors that regulate KIAA1199 expression remain
poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrate that
hypoxia promotes colon cancer dissemination through
up-regulation of KIAA1199 [26]. In the present study,
we demonstrate, for the first time, that exposure to
IL-1ß induces the expression of KIAA1199 which is
associated with enhanced migration. We also found
that treatment with NS-398 resulted in decreased
expression of KIAA1199. These findings suggest a
possible mechanistic linkage between inflammation
and KIAA1199 expression. In support of this finding,
a previous study showed that NF-κB induces the
expression of KIAA1199 and promote survival through
EGFR signaling [24]. Taken together, these findings
led to a hypothesis that inflammation promotes cancer
initiation and progression partly through induction of
KIAA1199.
In conclusion, these findings suggest that KIAA1199
expression may contribute to the aggressive phenotype of
PDAC cells through increasing LMW-HA. Our present
results also highlight the importance of KIAA1199 as a
therapeutic target for PDAC.

Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacture’s protocol. First strand
cDNA was synthesized from 1.0 μg of total RNA using
SuperScript® VILO cDNA synthesis Kit and Master Mix
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
Real-time mRNA expression analysis of KIAA1199 and a
housekeeping gene (GAPDH) for control was performed
using TaqMan@ Gene Expression Assays and Step One
Plus real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc.) according to the manufacture’s instruction. The assay
numbers for these genes were as follows: Hs01552124_
m1 (KIAA1199); and Hs02758991_g1 (GAPDH).
The relative quantification was given by the Ct
values, determining the reactions for target genes and an
internal control gene in all samples.

Cell migration assay
The migratory ability of cells was determined by
transwell cell migration assay using cell culture inserts
equipped with a filter membrane containing 8 μm pores
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lajes NJ). The lower chamber
was filled with RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS. The upper
chamber was filled with 2.0 x 104 cells (for PANC-1) or
4.0 x 104 cells (for BxPC-3) in the RPMI1640 containing
1% FBS. After 24 h incubation, the cells remaining on
the upper side of the filters were removed. The cells on
the bottom surface of the membrane were stained with
hematoxyline and eosin and the number of cells that had
migrated to the bottom surface of the membrane were
counted in five randomly selected microscopic fields in
each samples. Cell migration assays were also performed
in the presence of an IL-1ß or NS-398 which was added to
lower chambers at the beginning of assay.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
We used 2 PDAC cell lines, BxPC-3 and PANC1 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA,
USA). An immortalized cell line derived from human
pancreatic duct, HPDE, was a kind gift from Dr. M.S.
Tsao (Univ. of Toronto, Canada). PDAC cell lines were
maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies) and 1%
streptomycin and penicillin (Life Technologies). HPDE
was maintained in HuMedia-KG2 (KURABO, Osaka,
Japan), in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Recombinant
human IL-1ß (PEPROTECH, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and
NS-398 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA) were used
at different concentrations (IL-1ß: 500pg/ml, NS-398:
100, 200μM) for 48 hours treatment.

Cell proliferation assay
The capability of cell proliferation was measured
by MTT assay. Cells were plated at 3,000 cells/well in
96-well plates and incubated. Then cells were incubated
with 10 μl MTT (SERVA Electrophoresis, Heidelberg,
Germany) for 4 h at 37°C and 200 μl DMSO (Wako,
Osaka, Japan) was pipetted to solubilize the crystal
product. The absorbance of each well was measured with
a microplate reader at a wavelength of 570 nm.

siRNA targeting for KIAA1199
The siRNA targeting for KIAA1199 (ONTARGETplus Smart Pool Human KIAA1199 L-02229100) and negative control siRNA (ON-TARGETplus
Control siRNA Non-Targeting siRNA #1 D-001810-01-05)
were purchased from GE healthcare (Buckinghamshire,
England). BxPC-3 was transfected with 100 nM siRNA
using DhermaFECT 1 Transfection Reagent (GE
healthcare) according to manufacture’s instructions. After
48 hours treatment, the cells were immediately used for
further experiments.
