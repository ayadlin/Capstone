Abstract
Although many studies have uncovered an important role for
the receptor-binding protein kinase RIP1 in controlling cell
death signaling, its possible contributions to cancer pathogenesis have been little explored. Here, we report that RIP1 functions as an oncogenic driver in human melanoma. Although
RIP1 was commonly upregulated in melanoma, RIP1 silencing
inhibited melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and retarded the
growth of melanoma xenografts in vivo. Conversely, while
inducing apoptosis in a small proportion of melanoma cells,
RIP1 overexpression enhanced proliferation in the remaining
cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the proliferative

effects of RIP1 overexpression were mediated by NF-kB activation. Strikingly, ectopic expression of RIP1 enhanced the proliferation of primary melanocytes, triggering their anchorageindependent cell growth in an NF-kB–dependent manner. We
identiﬁed DNA copy-number gain and constitutive ubiquitination by a TNFa autocrine loop mechanism as two mechanisms
of RIP1 upregulation in human melanomas. Collectively, our
ﬁndings deﬁne RIP1 as an oncogenic driver in melanoma, with
potential implications for targeting its NF-kB–dependent activation mechanism as a novel approach to treat this disease.

Introduction

ubiquitination and/or linear ubiquitination of the protein
carried out by TRAF2/cIAPs and linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), respectively (8, 11–13). K63 polyubiquitin and linear ubiquitin chains linked to RIP1 serve as
substrates for binding of the TAB2/TAB3/TAK1 complex and
NEMO, leading to activation of NF-kB, which plays an important role in regulating many cellular processes (11, 12).
The expression of cIAPs is regulated by second mitochondriaderived activator of caspases (Smac), which is released from
mitochondria upon activation of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling (14). Once in the cytosol, Smac binds to cIAPs, leading to
their degradation (14). A number of small-molecule chemicals
that function pharmacologically as Smac mimetic have been
shown to similarly cause cIAP degradation (15, 16). When cIAPs
are inhibited, RIP1 is deubiquitinated by the ubiquitin-editing
enzyme A20 and the deubiquitinase cylindromatosis (17, 18).
This switches the function of RIP1 to that of promoting apoptosis
in complex IIa containing FADD and caspase-8 upon exposure to
TNFa (6, 8). In this case, the kinase activity of RIP1 is essential for
TNFa-induced apoptosis (8). However, if caspase-8 activation is
limited, RIP1 recruits RIP3, leading to formation of complex IIb
causing programmed necrosis (necroptosis) in some types of cells
(6, 9). Noticeably, TNFa can also trigger apoptosis independently
of RIP1 when protein synthesis is inhibited (19, 20). This induction of apoptosis is inhibitable by cFLIP, but is not affected by
inhibition of RIP1 kinase activity (21).
Many studies in recent years have primarily focused on the role
of RIP1 in induction of cell death (5–7). In particular, the role of
RIP1 in apoptosis and necrosis of various types of cancer cells in
response to therapeutic agents is being increasingly reported (6,
7). However, RIP1/ mice display extensive apoptosis in selected
tissues and die at age 1 to 3 days (5), indicating that RIP1 has an
important role in cell survival in a tissue type–speciﬁc manner.
Indeed, recent evidence suggests that RIP1 is constitutively polyubiquitinated by cIAPs and interacts with TAK to facilitate cell

Aberrant activation of survival signaling pathways plays an
important role in cancer development, progression, and resistance to treatment (1). In melanoma, identiﬁcation of activating
mutations in BRAF as the major cause of constitutive activation of
the MAPK pathway has led to successful development of mutant
BRAF-speciﬁc inhibitors in the treatment of the disease (2).
However, primary and acquired resistance, which is commonly
associated with activation of other survival pathways, remains a
major obstacle in the quest for curative treatment (3, 4).
Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) mediates both
cell survival and death signaling and is emerging as an important determinant of cell fate in response to cellular stress, in
particular, to activation of death receptors such as TNFa receptor 1 (TNFaR1; refs. 5–8). Upon TNFaR1 stimulation, RIP1,
along with other proteins, including TRADD, TRAF2, cIAP1,
and cIAP2, is recruited to form prosurvival complex I (5, 9, 10).
This results in stabilization of RIP1 through K63-linked poly-

RIP1 in Melanoma

Antibodies and reagents
The antibody against RIP1 used in immunoprecipitation and
antibodies against cIAP1, cIAP2, TNFaR1, and NEMO were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody against
RIP1 used in Western blotting was from BD Biosciences. Antibodies against phospho-IkBa, IkBa, and cFLIP were from Cell
Signaling Technology. The antibody against K63-linked ubiquitin
was from Novus Biologicals. The blocking antibody against TNFa
and recombinant human TNFa was from R&D Systems. The RIP1
kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), the Smac mimetic SM406,
and the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk were from Selleckchem. The
NF-kB inhibitors PDTC and BAY-11-7082 were from SigmaAldrich. The NF-kB reporter assay Kit was from QIAGEN.

survival in a number of cancer cell lines (9, 22). Nonetheless, little
is known about the role of RIP1 in the pathogenesis of melanoma.
In this study, we have examined the role of RIP1 in the
development and progression of melanoma. We report here that
RIP1 is commonly upregulated and plays a role in melanoma cell
proliferation through activation of NF-kB. Moreover, we show
that although overexpression of RIP1 causes anchorage-independent growth of melanocytes, knockdown of RIP1 retards melanoma growth in a xenograft model. Our results also reveal that
autocrine TNFa contributes to upregulation of RIP1 through IAPmediated K63-linked polyubiquitination, and that RIP1 in turn
protects against TNFa-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells.

Materials and Methods

IHC
IHC staining and quantitation were performed as described
previously (27). Brieﬂy, antigen retrieval was performed in a
pressure cooker for 30 seconds at 125 C. Antibody detection was
performed using the Dako Envision HRP Detection system/DAB
as per the manufacturer's instructions. Slides were counterstained
with Azure B to differentiate the melanin from the brown DAB
immunolabeling.

Cell lines and human tissues
Human melanoma cell lines described previously were cultured in DMEM containing 5% FCS (23). Human melanocytes
(HEMa-LP, HEMn-DP, and HEMn-MP) were purchased from
Banksia Scientiﬁc and cultured as previously described (24).
Human fresh melanoma isolates were prepared from surgical
specimens according to the published method (25). Individual
cell line authentication was conﬁrmed using the AmpFISTR
Identiﬁler PCR Ampliﬁcation Kit from Applied Biosystems and
GeneMarker V1.91 software (SoftGenetics LLC). A panel of 16
markers was tested, and each cell line had a distinct individual set
of markers present (26). Tissue microarrays were constructed from
formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) melanocytic tumour
tissues retrieved from the Department of Tissue Pathology and
Diagnostic Oncology at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Australia (Supplementary Table S1). Studies using human tissues
were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of the
University of Newcastle and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,
Australia.

Cell viability
A CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit was used
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Cells
were seeded at 5  103/well in 96-well plates overnight before
treatment as desired. CellTiter-Glo Reagent (100 mL) was added
and incubated for 10 minutes. Luminescence was recorded by
Synergy 2 multidetection microplate reader (BioTek; ref. 28).

then allowed to grow for a further 12 days before ﬁxation with
methanol and staining with crystal violet (0.5% solution).
Cell proliferation assays
BrdUrd cell proliferation assays were carried out using an assay
kit (Cell Signaling Technology) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, cells were seeded at 5  103/well in 96-well plates
overnight before treatment as desired. BrdUrd (10 mmol/L) was
added and cells were incubated for 4 hours before BrdUrd assays
were carried out. Absorbance was read at 450 nm using a Synergy 2
multidetection microplate reader (BioTek).
NF-kB reporter assays
NF-kB activity assays were performed using an assay kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions (29). Brieﬂy, cells
transfected with the NF-kB activity reporter with or without
cotransfection with indicated siRNAs or cDNAs were subjected
to Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega) after desired
treatment.
Anchorage-independent cell growth
Cells (5  104) were seeded in 0.3% cell agar layer, which was
on top of 0.6% base agar layer in 12-well culture plates. Cells were
then incubated for a further 30 days at 37 C and 5% CO2. Cell
colony formation was then examined under a light microscope.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were carried out as
described previously (30, 31). In brief, equal amounts of protein
extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot.
For immunoprecipitation, extracts were mixed and precipitated
with antibody and protein A/G Agarose beads by incubation at 4 C.
The bound proteins were removed by boiling in SDS buffer and
resolved in SDS-PAGE gels for immunoblotting analysis.
Quantitative PCR analysis
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out as described before
(30). Brieﬂy, the reaction was carried out for 40 cycles: 95 C for 15
seconds; 60 C for 1 minute. The relative abundance of mRNA
expression of a control sample was arbitrarily designated as 1.
Primers used were listed in Supplementary Experimental
Procedures.
Small interference RNA
The siRNAs were purchased from GenePharma. Transfection of
siRNAs was carried out in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) using
Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's transfection protocol (27).
Short hairpin RNA
The human RIP1 shRNA Kit (TG320591), human PTEN shRNA
Kit (TG320498), and scramble shRNA Kit (TG300130), in which

shRNA constructs are in retroviral GFP vector (pGFP-VRS), were
purchased from Origene and were used according to the manufacturer's protocols.
Plasmid vectors and transfection
The lentivirus-based inducible gene expression system (ViraPower HiPerform T-REx Gateway Vector Kit) was purchased from
Invitrogen. The pCMV-Myc-RIP1 construct was from Origene. A
mutant RIP1 construct containing four silent mutations within
the RIP1 shRNA1 target sequence was also cloned into the pCMVMyc vector. The kinase dead RIP1 (RIP1-K45A) construct was
from Dr. Zheng Gang Liu (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda).
The pCR-cFLIP construct was from Dr. H Nakano (Juntendo
University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan). Plasmids were
transfected as described previously (27).
Melanoma xenograft mouse model
Studies on melanoma xenografts were approved by the Animal
Research Ethics Committee of Shanxi Cancer Hospital of
China and were carried out as previously described (27). Brieﬂy,
cells (1  107) were injected s.c. into each ﬂank of male athymic
nude mice (Model Animal Research Centre of Nanjing University,
China). Tumor growth was measured every 2 days using a caliper.
Mice were sacriﬁced, and tumors were weighed at 30 days after
tumour cell transplantation.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using JMP Statistics Made
Visual software. The Student t test or Kruskal–Wallis test was used
to assess differences between different groups. A P value less than
0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
RIP1 is frequently upregulated in human melanoma
We examined the expression of RIP1 by use of IHC in tissue
microarrays constructed from 100 FFPE melanocytic tumors
(Supplementary Table S1; ref. 27). The results revealed that RIP1
expression was frequently increased in melanomas compared
with nevi (Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary Table S1). However,
there was no signiﬁcant difference in RIP1 levels between thin and
thick primary, or between primary and metastatic melanomas
(Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1),
suggesting that RIP1 is upregulated at early stages in the pathogenesis of melanoma.
We also examined RIP1 expression in a panel of melanoma cell
lines, which were generated from melanomas of different stages
and had varying status of the most common mutations in BRAF
(BRAFV600E) and NRAS (NRASQ61R) (Fig. 1C). RIP1 was also
commonly expressed at increased levels in the melanoma cell
lines irrespective of their origins and genetic backgrounds in
comparison with cultured melanocytes [pooled melanocytes

RIP1 in Melanoma

from 3 different lines (HEMa-LP, HEMn-DP, and HEMn-MP)
were used to simplify analysis as these melanocytes expressed
similarly low levels of RIP1; Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S2].
The elevated RIP1 expression was also evidenced in a panel of 21
fresh metastatic melanoma isolates by immunoblotting (Fig. 1D).
RIP1 promotes melanoma cell proliferation
We focused on examination of the functional signiﬁcance of
RIP1 upregulation in melanoma cells. Although RIP1 knockdown
did not cause melanoma cell death, it inhibited cell proliferation
as shown in BrdUrd incorporation and clonogenic assays (Fig.
2A–C). Introduction of a construct expressing shRNA-resistant
RIP1 cDNA reversed the inhibitory effect (Fig. 2D and E), demonstrating the speciﬁcity of the RIP1 shRNA and consolidating the
role of RIP1 in regulation of melanoma cell proliferation.
We introduced an RIP1-expressing construct into MM200 and
IgR3 cells that expressed relatively low levels of endogenous RIP1
to establish sublines (MM200.RIP1 and IgR3.RIP1) conditionally
expressing RIP1 in response to Tet (Fig. 2F). Induction of RIP1
reduced cell viability by approximately 10%, which could be
reversed by the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, indicative
of induction of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3A; ref. 32).
Nevertheless, the remaining cells with RIP1 overexpression
acquired increased proliferation rates (Fig. 2G). Of note, the RIP1
kinase inhibitor Nec-1 did not affect cell death caused by RIP1
overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S3A), consistent with previous reports that introduction of a kinase domain-defective form of
RIP1 induced cell death to the similar extent as overexpression of
wild-type RIP1 (6, 20). Indeed, introduction of a kinase-dead
RIP1 mutant similarly reduced viability of MM200 and IgR3 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Nevertheless, kinase-dead RIP1
retained the ability to promote melanoma cell proliferation
irrespective of the presence of Nec-1 (Fig. 2I), indicating that
RIP1-mediated promotion of melanoma cell proliferation is
similarly independent of its kinase activity. In support, Nec-1 did
not affect melanoma cell proliferation even in MM200 and IgR3
cells overexpressing RIP1 (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
RIP1 promotes melanoma cell proliferation through activation
of NF-kB
As reported before, NF-kB was constitutively activated at high
levels in melanoma cells compared with melanocytes (Supplementary Fig. S4; ref. 33). However, the levels of activation were
reduced when RIP1 was knocked down (Fig. 3A and B). Consistently, phosphorylation of IkBa at Serine 32/36 (p-IkBa S32/36)
that is marked for degradation was decreased (Fig. 3B; ref. 34).
Introduction of the shRNA-resistant form of RIP1 reversed the
inhibitory effect of RIP1 knockdown on activation of NF-kB (Fig.

3A), further verifying the role of RIP1 in NF-kB activation. Indeed,
TAK1 and NEMO that are essential for RIP1-mediated NF-kB
activation were coprecipitated with RIP1 in melanoma cells (Fig.
3C; ref. 35). Moreover, RIP1 overexpression increased NF-kB
activation in MM200 and IgR3 cells (Fig. 3D).
The signiﬁcance of NF-kB in RIP1-mediated promotion of
melanoma cell proliferation was demonstrated by introduction
of a nondegradable mutant of IkBa (IkBa-S32AS36A; ref. 29),
which inhibited melanoma cell proliferation even when RIP1 was
overexpressed (Fig. 3E and F). Similarly, the NF-kB inhibitors
PDTC and BAY-11-7082 also abolished RIP1 overexpressiontriggered enhancement in melanoma cell proliferation (Fig. 3G;
ref. 29). These results indicate that NF-kB activation plays an
important role in RIP1-mediated promotion of melanoma cell
proliferation. This was further supported by the ﬁnding that RIP1
knockdown could not reduce melanoma cell proliferation when
IkBa was co-knocked down, which caused NF-kB hyperactivation
(Fig. 3H–J). Furthermore, the levels of NF-kB activity appeared
positively associated with the levels of RIP1 expression in fresh
metastatic melanoma isolates (Figs. 1D and 3K).
RIP1 modulates melanoma growth
To investigate whether elevated RIP1 contributes to melanocyte
transformation, we introduced the RIP1-expressing construct into
HEMn-MPmelanocytes(Fig.4A).Alikeitseffectonmelanomacells,
RIP1 overexpression reduced viability of melanocytes by approximately 10% in a caspase-dependent manner (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Nevertheless, it increased the proliferation rate of the
remainingcells.ThiswasassociatedwithincreasedNF-kBactivation
as it could be reversed by the NF-kB inhibitor BAY-11-7082 (Fig. 4A
and B). Moreover, RIP1 overexpression triggered anchorage-independentgrowth comparable with that observed with knockdown of
PTEN, which was used as a control (Fig. 4C–E; ref. 27).
To examine whether elevated RIP1 affects melanoma growth in
vivo, we transplanted Mel-RM cells with or without RIP1 stably
knocked down into nu/nu mice (Fig. 4F). Deﬁciency in RIP1 caused
retardation of tumor growth (Fig. 4G and H), which was associated
with increased expression of IkBa and reduction in its phosphorylation (p-IkBa S32/36; Fig. 4I). The role of RIP1 in promoting
melanoma tumorigenesis was conﬁrmed by transplanting MM200
cells stably overexpressing RIP1 into nu/nu mice (Fig. 4J). This
demonstrated that RIP1 overexpression increased NF-kB activation and promoted melanoma growth in vivo (Fig. 4K–M).
Posttranslational modiﬁcation is critical for upregulation of
RIP1 in melanoma cells
In contrast with the common increase in the RIP1 protein, there
were wide variations in RIP1 mRNA levels in melanoma cell lines

Liu et al.

and fresh isolates (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S6A). In
particular, some melanoma cell lines expressed even reduced
levels of the RIP1 mRNA relative to melanocytes (Fig. 5A). qPCR
analysis of genomic DNA showed that one of 11 melanoma cell
lines and one of 7 fresh melanoma isolates had copy-number gain
of the RIP1 gene (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S6B), in keeping
with the TCGA dataset showing that RIP1 copy-number gain
occurred in 5.3% (20/375) of melanomas (www.cbioportal.
org/public-portal). These data suggest that although DNA
copy-number gain contributes to upregulation of RIP1 in some
melanomas, posttranscriptional upregulation is a more commonly involved mechanism. In support, the turnover rates of the RIP1
mRNA remained comparable between melanoma and melanocyte cell lines regardless of its expression levels (Supplementary
Fig. S7). Furthermore, the turnover rates of the RIP1 protein were
prolonged in melanoma cell lines expressing higher levels of the
protein (Fig. 5C and D).
We examined the ubiquitination status of RIP1 in Mel-RM and
ME4405 cells that expressed relatively high levels of the protein.
RIP1 was constitutively ubiquitinated with K63-linked ubiquitin
chains as determined using an antibody speciﬁcally directed to
k63-linked ubiquitin (Fig. 5E), suggesting that ubiquitination of
RIP1 by cIAP1 and cIAP2 plays a role in its upregulation in
melanoma cells. This was supported by the physical association
of cIAP1 and cIAP2 with RIP1 as shown by coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 5F), and was further consolidated by downregulation of RIP1 when cIAP1, and to a lesser extent, cIAP2, was
reduced by the Smac mimetic SM406, or when cIAP1 or cIAP2 was
knocked down (Fig. 5G–I).
Autocrine TNFa contributes to upregulation of RIP1 in
melanoma cells
In keeping with previous reports (36), the TNFa transcript
was readily detected in melanoma cells (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the
TNFa protein was found in supernatants of melanoma cell
cultures, although the levels varied widely among melanoma
cell lines (Fig. 6B). Nevertheless, melanoma cells expressed in
general higher levels of TNFa mRNA than melanocytes (Fig.
6A). Similarly, melanoma cell culture media contained
increased levels of its protein compared with melanocyte cell
culture media (Fig. 6B). Strikingly, the addition of a blocking
antibody against TNFa in melanoma cell cultures caused
reduction in RIP1 ubiquitination and expression and reduced
the amount of cIAP1 and cIAP2 coprecipitated with RIP1 (Fig.
6C–E), suggesting that autocrine TNFa is responsible, at least in
part, for upregulation of RIP1 through regulating cIAP-mediated RIP1 ubiquitination. Indeed, TNFaR1 knockdown also
triggered reduction in RIP1 ubiquitination and expression and
reduced the amount of cIAP1 and cIAP2 coprecipitated with
RIP1 (Fig. 6F–H). Furthermore, the TNFa blocking antibody or
TNFaR1 knockdown reduced NF-kB activation and decreased
proliferation, albeit moderately, in melanoma cells, which
could be abolished by RIP1 overexpression (Fig. 6I and J and
Supplementary Fig. S8).
RIP1 protects melanoma cells from TNFa-induced apoptosis
Although RIP1 knockdown did not impinge on cell viability, it
conferred sensitivity of a proportion of melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by recombinant TNFa (Fig. 7A). This suggests that
endogenous RIP1 plays a role in protecting melanoma cells from
the toxicity of TNFa. Treatment with Nec-1 did not have a similar

1742 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

sensitizing effect (Fig. 7B), indicating that RIP1 protects melanoma cells independently of its kinase activity.
We tested whether TNFa-induced apoptosis in RIP1 knockdown melanoma cells could be inhibited by cFLIP overexpression. As shown in Fig. 7C and D, RIP1 knockdown did not
sensitize Mel-RM cells stably overexpressing cFLIP to TNFainduced apoptosis, suggesting that RIP1 inhibits TNFa-triggered
cFLIP-inhibitable apoptosis in melanoma cells. Indeed, the levels
of cFLIP are reduced in melanoma cells with RIP1 knocked down
(Fig. 7E). Co-knockdown of IkBa reversed RIP1 knockdown–
mediated reduction in cFLIP and enhancement in TNFa-induced
killing (Fig. 7E and F), indicating that RIP1 protects melanoma
cells from apoptosis induced by TNFa through activation of
NF-kB.

Discussion
Although RIP1 can mediate both cell survival and death signaling, many studies in recent years focused on its role in induction of apoptosis and programmed necrosis by various cellular
stresses (6, 7, 20, 32). Indeed, similar to our ﬁnding that introduction of exogenous RIP1 triggers apoptosis in a proportion of
melanoma cells and melanocytes, RIP1 overexpression has been
shown to cause apoptotic cell death in many other cell types (32).
These observations suggest that RIP1 may function primarily as an
antisurvival protein and contribute to tumor suppression. However, we found in this study that RIP1 expression was frequently
upregulated in melanoma cells, pointing to a role of RIP1 in
favoring the pathogenesis of melanoma, and indicating that the
expression of RIP1 must be under tight control so that its cellular
level remains constantly below a threshold to ensure avoidance of
apoptosis. Nevertheless, how RIP1 at high levels induces apoptosis in a selective population of melanoma cells and melanocytes
remains unknown. This does not require the kinase activity of
RIP1, as neither Nec-1 nor the kinase-dead mutant of RIP1
impinged on cell death. The death domain (DD) of RIP1 allows
it to interact with other DD-containing proteins including FADD
(6, 20), which can in turn recruit caspase-8. It is conceivable that
RIP1 at high concentrations may trigger proximity-driven dimerization of caspase-8, thus leading to its activation and apoptosis
(6, 8). On the other hand, cells that can survive RIP1 overexpression may possess intrinsic or acquired mechanisms that antagonize activation of caspase-8, thus protecting against apoptosis.
An important ﬁnding of this study is that RIP1 promotes
melanoma cell proliferation and enhances melanoma growth.
However, in contrast with previous reports in other types of cells
(35, 37), inhibition of p53 does not appear to play a major role in
RIP1-mediated proliferation of melanoma cells, as knockdown of
RIP1 similarly inhibited cell proliferation in p53-null melanoma
cells (ME4405 cells; ref. 38). In addition, RIP1 knockdown does
not affect p53 expression in melanoma cells (35, 37). Moreover,
RIP1 knockdown did not affect the expression of peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1a (PGC-1a)
that has been recently shown to play a role in RIP1-mediated
suppression of p53 though regulating mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation and glycolysis in lung cancer cells (data not
shown; ref. 39). Although the mechanism responsible for this cell
type–dependent involvement of p53 in RIP1-mediated regulation
of cell proliferation remains to be addressed, it is known that wildtype p53 is often expressed at high levels but fails to exert an
effective tumor suppressive role in melanoma cells (38).

NF-kB is not involved in RIP1-mediated promotion of cell
proliferation in some types of cells (5, 39). However, we found
that NF-kB activation was critical for RIP1 to promote melanoma
cell proliferation. This was demonstrated by (i) RIP1 knockdown
resulted in decreased NF-kB activation, whereas melanoma cells
that survived RIP1 overexpression displayed increased NF-kB
activation; (ii) TAK1 and NEMO were physically associated with
RIP1; (iii) inhibition of NF-kB activation abolished enhancement
in proliferation of melanoma cells overexpressing RIP; and (iv),
hyperactivation of NF-kB eliminated RIP1 knockdown–mediated
inhibition of cell proliferation. The mechanisms regulating cell
type–dependent involvement of NF-kB remain to be clariﬁed.
Regardless, our results indicate that RIP1 is responsible, at least in
part, for constitutive NF-kB activation that is commonly found at
high levels in melanoma cells (29, 40).

1744 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

Although RIP1 was expressed at elevated levels in melanoma
cells, its mRNA levels varied widely in melanoma cells, and in
some cases, were even lower than the levels in melanocytes.
These ﬁndings promoted us to examine posttranscriptional
mechanisms responsible for RIP1 upregulation. Indeed, RIP1
was constitutively polyubiquitinated with K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which is known to stabilize the protein (8–11, 13).
Consistent with the established role of cIAPs in K63-linked
polyubiquitination of RIP1 (9, 10), cIAP1 and cIAP2 were
physically associated with RIP1. Because cIAP1s are transcriptional targets of NF-kB and RIP1 contributes to constitutive
activation of NF-kB (9, 22, 41), it seems that a dynamic positive
feedback loop of NF-kB–cIAPs–RIP1 maintains the high levels
of RIP1 expression and NF-kB activation in melanoma cells
(Figs. 1A–D and 3A).

Melanoma cells have long been known to secrete TNFa, which
promotes melanoma progression (42). Consistent with this, we
found that autocrine TNFa played an important role in sustaining
the NF-kB–cIAPs–RIP1-positive feedback loop in melanoma cells
(Fig. 6). Because the production of TNFa is transcriptionally

1746 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

regulated by NF-kB (42), it appears that TNFa is an essential
built-in apparatus of the NF-kB–cIAPs–RIP1 feedback loop, and
plays a driving role in activation of these intracellular components. These results suggest that autocrine TNFa may be involved
in intrinsic resistance of melanoma cells to treatment. Indeed,

RIP1 in Melanoma

TNFa receptor activation contributes to resistance of melanoma
to therapeutic agents such as BRAF inhibitors through activation
of NF-kB (43). Autocrine TNFa also contributes to cell proliferation and resistance to treatment in some other types of cancers
(44).
In addition to autocrine TNFa, cancer cells are commonly
exposed to microenvironments characterized by chronic inﬂammation associated with high levels of TNFa production (45).
Circumvention of the cell death–inducing potential is essential
for cancer cells to evade this detrimental effect of TNFa. We found
that, despite its established role in TNFa-induced cell death when
cIAPs are inhibited (20, 32), RIP1 played a role in protection of
melanoma cells from apoptosis induced by TNFa through NF-kB
activation and subsequent upregulation of cFLIP. Thus, cFLIP is a
major effector of the NF-kB–cIAPs–RIP1 feedback loop that
protects melanoma cells from apoptosis induced by TNFa. Of
note, although TNFa plus Smac mimetic induces apoptosis in
many types of cells including melanoma cells (6, 46), we did not
observe signiﬁcant apoptosis in all but one melanoma cell line
treated with the combination of TNFa and the Smac mimetic
SM406. This is conceivably due to cell line–dependent effects of
the treatment.
The role of RIP1 as an oncogenic regulator in the pathogenesis
of melanoma is consolidated by the ﬁnding that RIP1 overexpression promoted proliferation and triggered anchorage-independent growth of melanocytes. Indeed, the signiﬁcant increase in
RIP1 expression in primary melanomas compared with nevi
indicates that RIP1 upregulation is an early event during melanomagenesis. Importantly, RIP1 upregulation is not associated
with oncogenic activation of NRAS or BRAF, suggesting that it may
cooperate with oncogenic mutations in NRAS or BRAF to promote
the pathogenesis of melanoma, and that inhibition of the oncogenic activity of RIP1 may negatively regulate melanoma growth
irrespective of mutations in NRAS/BRAF, which often underlies
resistance of melanoma to treatment (47). Our ﬁnding that RIP1
promotes melanoma cell proliferation through NF-kB points to
the possibility of targeting the intermediate domain of RIP1 that is
required for NF-kB activation as a novel approach in the treatment

of melanoma (5, 48). However, this has to be cautiously evaluated, as RIP1 is known to mediate cancer cell death induced by
various agents (5–7). Furthermore, inhibitors that target the
intermediate domain of RIP1 have to be carefully designed so
that they do not impinge on the kinase activity of RIP1 as do
currently available RIP inhibitors such as Nec-1 that inhibit RIP1mediated cell death (8, 49).
