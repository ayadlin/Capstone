BACKGROUND: Therapy related secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) was commonly associated
with prior exposure to alkylating agents or topoisomerase inhibitor. The long-term outcome of such
patients with secondary AML was found to be worse than that of patients with de novo AML. Earlier
reports suggested similar outcomes for patients with de novo and secondary AML associated with corebinding factor (CBF) abnormalities. METHODS: A total of 188 patients with CBF AML were analyzed. The
frequency of secondary CBF AML was 9%. RESULTS: Patients with secondary CBF AML were found to have
significantly worse overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) compared with patients with de novo CBF
AML. Secondary CBF AML status appeared to have only marginal significance in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Matched analysis (by age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and additional cytogenetic abnormality) indicated worse OS and EFS in patients with secondary CBF AML.

Reports of the long-term outcome of patients with secondary CBF AML are scarce because most reports of CBF
AML do not distinguish between patients with de novo
and those with secondary disease.
Herein, we report on outcomes of patients with secondary CBF AML and compare long-term outcome data
with that of patients with de novo CBF AML.

Statistical Analysis

Between 1991 and 2007, 188 patients with CBF AML
were treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center. Based on a history of a prior diagnosis of
malignancy (except skin or in situ cancers), patients with
exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation were classified
as having either de novo or secondary CBF AML. Patient
characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Patient characteristics at the time of presentation between
patients with de novo and secondary CBF AML were
compared. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to assess
the difference in continuous variables, and categoric variables were assessed using chi-square tests or Fisher exact
tests.
The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used
to generate survival curves and event-free survival (EFS)
curves, for which the overall survival (OS) is defined as the
time between admission to The University of Texas M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center and last follow-up. EFS was
calculated from the date of achieving CR to the date of the
earliest disease recurrence or death or last follow-up. The

Treatment
All patients underwent induction chemotherapy with intermediate-dose to high-dose cytarabine-based chemotherapy (total dose of 6 to 10 g/m2), and patients
achieving a complete remission (CR) received high-dose

log-rank test was subsequently used to access the difference in OS or EFS between the 2 groups. In addition, to
study the effect of patient characteristics on survival and
EFS, Cox proportional hazards regression models were
used to assess the hazard ratios. In univariate Cox regression, the effects of the variables were modeled individually. All variables were then included into an initial
multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, and a stepwise model selection procedure was performed with equal
entering and staying probabilities of 0.1. At the end of
model selection, variables with P values <.05 were
retained.
All computations were performed using SAS 9.1 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) using the
Windows XP 2002 operating system. All reported P values were for 2-sided tests, and a P value <.05 was considered statistically significant.
Patients with secondary CBF AML were matched
by age (5 years), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status, and the presence of additional chromosomal abnormalities to patients with de
novo CBF AML. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to
generate survival curves, and the log-rank test was performed to evaluate the difference between groups.

RESULTS
A total of 188 AML patients with CBF AML were
included in this analysis. Among them, 17 (9%) patients
had secondary CBF AML. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Twelve patients with secondary CBF
AML had prior exposure to both an alkylating agent and
topoisomerase inhibitor. Six patients had prior lymphoma
and 5 had a prior diagnosis of breast cancer. The median
time from treatment of prior malignancy to the development of AML was 2 years (range, 1 year17 years). None
of the patients with secondary CBF AML had a documented phase of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Patients with secondary CBF AML were significantly
older than those with de novo disease (P ¼ .02) and had
lower white blood cell (WBC) counts at the time of presentation (P ¼ .02). Among all patients with CBF AML,
94 (50%) patients had chromosomal abnormalities in
addition to CBF abnormality but there was no difference
noted among the de novo (87 of 171) and secondary (7 of
17) disease groups with regard to the frequency of addiCancer

tional chromosomal abnormalities (P ¼ .63). Two (2 of
17) patients in the secondary CBF AML group had chromosome 7q deletion, and 2 others had sex chromosome
loss. Three (3 of 171) patients in the de novo group had
7q deletion.

Treatment Outcomes
One hundred seventy-three (92%) patients achieved a CR
or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). There
were 6 (3%) induction-related deaths, 3 patients were resistant to induction therapy, and 2 patients refused therapy. Five of the 15 (33%) patients with secondary CBF
AML who achieved a CR had developed disease
recurrence compared with 57 of 158 (36%) patients
with de novo CBF AML. Of these 5 patients, 3 received
cytarabine-based salvage therapy, 1 was treated with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and another received thalidomide for secondary MDS with chromosome 5 and 7
abnormality without the previously present inversion 16
abnormality.

Survival Analysis
The median OS among all patients was 269 weeks (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 170 weeks->800 weeks).
The median duration of CR for the entire group was
>600 weeks (95% CI, 94 weeks to >734 weeks). The OS
(P ¼ .004) (Fig. 1) and EFS (P ¼ .04) of patients with secondary CBF AML were found to be significantly worse
than that of patients with de novo CBF AML.

Univariate and Multivariate Analysis
On univariate analysis, age, secondary CBF AML, bilirubin, and hemoglobin were found to significantly impact
OS. After adjusting for age, bilirubin, and hemoglobin;
secondary CBF AML status was found to have a marginally significant effect (P ¼ .11) on OS. Similarly, on univariate analysis, age, secondary CBF AML, higher
bilirubin, lower hemoglobin, and higher WBC counts
were found to be significantly associated with a worse
EFS. However, after adjusting for age, WBC count, and
bilirubin; secondary AML status was not found to be significantly associated with a worse EFS (P ¼ .26).
Matched Analysis
Patients with secondary CBF AML were matched 1:1
with patients with de novo disease based on age, ECOG
performance status, and the presence of additional chromosomal abnormalities (Table 2). Patients with secondary CBF AML had a worse OS (P ¼ .001) (Fig. 2) and
EFS (P ¼ .003) compared with matched patients with de
novo disease.

DISCUSSION
Although CBF AML is considered to have favorable prognosis, results from larger groups indicate that the EFS at
5 years is in the range of 40% to 50%.3,6 This highlights
the presence of ample room for improvement. The inci3220

dence of secondary CBF AML is relatively low compared
with that of secondary AML with unfavorable cytogenetics.8,11,12 An earlier report indicated that the outcome of
patients with secondary CBF AML is similar to their de
novo counterparts.13 Conversely, the results of the current
analysis highlight a worse outcome in this subgroup of
patients with ‘‘good-risk’’ cytogenetics. Given that
patients with secondary CBF AML tend to be older than
those with de novo disease, the finding that they have secondary leukemia still negatively impacts their OS and
EFS, as evidenced by our matched analysis.
Secondary AML associated with balanced translocations usually occur after prior exposure to topoisomerase
II inhibitors. With improved survival noted among
patients treated with such agents, the incidence of secondary leukemias including secondary CBF AMLs is expected
to increase. Whether early referral for stem cell transplantation at the time of first CR for patients with secondary
CBF AML will improve outcome is not known.
Recent reports have linked the presence of unusual
CBFB-MYH11 transcripts in therapy-related CBF AML
with inv16 abnormality.14 Additional cryptic mutations
in patients with therapy-related CBF AML may be responsible for the worse overall outcome, and a systematic
approach to document such additional genetic events may
help in unraveling its pathogenesis. Because of the presence of unique transcripts, CBF AML is amenable to molecular monitoring of disease.15-17 Multiple log
reductions in fusion transcripts after induction and

consolidation therapies are associated with better EFS.16
Interventions designed to be implemented at times of molecular progression of disease or lack of optimal molecular
response may improve outcome in patients with CBF
AML, including secondary CBF AML. However, to our
knowledge, the definitions of molecular progression or
suboptimal response have not been established in patients
with CBF AML. Moreover, unlike for patients with overt
clinical disease recurrence, the risk-versus-benefit profile
of early intervention will need to be established.
