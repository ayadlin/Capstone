viously acknowledged in the acupuncture literature so comparison of treatment to no intervention is not that useful.4
Additionally, there are a number of problems with
the authors’ choice of a sham:
1. The patients receiving electroacupuncture experienced de
qi, whereas patients receiving sham acupuncture did not.
Clearly, this would have strongly influenced a patient’s
perception of whether he or she was receiving the active
treatment and would have affected expectations.
2. In electroacupuncture, the needles were placed
“around the joint with the most pain” (the distance is
not specified), but in sham acupuncture, the needles
were at least 5 cm from the most painful joint. This
could have affected patient perception as well. As nonpenetrative needles were used in the sham acupuncture
patients, this difference seems unnecessary.
3. Patients randomized to electroacupuncture obviously
received electrical stimulation. Unless this was imperceptible, it also would have affected patient expectations.

Sham Procedure Inadequate
It is unfortunate that Mao et al’s study1 was underpowered
to evaluate whether electroacupuncture is more effective
than sham acupuncture. It is widely recognized that there is
a strong placebo effect present during the study of subjective
responses such as pain2 and anxiety3; this issue has been pre1148

Reply to Sham Procedure
Inadequate
William Hay raises several issues related to our sham acupuncture design, including the lack of de qi sensation,1
