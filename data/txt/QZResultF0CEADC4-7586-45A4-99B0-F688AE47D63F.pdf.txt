ABSTRACT
Despite recent advances in diagnosis and management, prostrate cancer remains
the second most common cause of death from cancer in American men, after lung
cancer. Failure of chemotherapies and hormone-deprivation therapies is the major
cause of death in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Currently,
the androgen inhibitors enzalutamide and abiraterone are approved for treatment
of metastatic CRPC. Here we show for the first time that both enzalutamide and
abiraterone render prostate tumor cells more sensitive to T cell-mediated lysis
through immunogenic modulation, and that these immunomodulatory activities are
androgen receptor (AR)-dependent. In studies reported here, the NAIP gene was
significantly down-regulated in human prostate tumor cells treated in vitro and in
vivo with enzalutamide. Functional analysis revealed that NAIP played a critical role
in inducing CTL sensitivity. Amplification of AR is a major mechanism of resistance
to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Here, we show that enzalutamide enhances
sensitivity to immune-mediated killing of prostate tumor cells that overexpress
AR. The immunomodulatory properties of enzalutamide and abiraterone provide
a rationale for their use in combination with immunotherapeutic agents in CRPC,
especially for patients with minimal response to enzalutamide or abiraterone alone,
or for patients who have developed resistance to ADT.

INTRODUCTION

been demonstrated in clinical trials [4-6], including the
AFFIRM trial where it mediated a 4.8-month advantage
in overall survival compared to placebo [6]. Abiraterone
is a potent inhibitor of CYP17A1, a rate-limiting enzyme
in androgen biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme
subsequently blocks the production of androgen in all
endocrine organs, including the testes, adrenal glands,
and in the prostate tumor itself [7]. In a phase III study
in patients with CRPC previously treated with docetaxel,
abiraterone was shown to improve overall survival by 3.9
months compared to placebo [8].
Immunogenic modulation, whereby conventional
therapies alter tumor phenotype, rendering tumor
cells more susceptible to immune-mediated attack,
has been described previously and reviewed [9]. The
immunomodulatory effects of conventional therapies

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard
of care for prostate cancer [1, 2]. However, most patients
eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC). CRPC was generally thought to be completely
resistant to ADT. However, it has been demonstrated
that CRPC remains dependent on androgen signaling for
growth and that CRPC is sensitive to further manipulation
of androgen signaling [3]. Two agents FDA-approved
for ADT currently play a major role in the management
of CRPC: enzalutamide and abiraterone. Enzalutamide
is an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist that blocks
androgens from binding to the AR and prevents nuclear
translocation and coactivator recruitment of the ligandreceptor complex. The utility of enzalutamide has

of tumor antigens, Fas, MHC moieties, and components
of the antigen-processing machinery (APM). The various
immunomodulatory effects of standard therapies can be
exploited to enhance the antitumor activity induced by
immunotherapy. The immunogenic modulation potential
of ADT, particularly enzalutamide, was first described
in a mouse model. Treating murine prostate carcinomas
with enzalutamide in vitro increased expression of MHC-I
and Fas on the cell surface, which subsequently improved
the sensitivity of TRAMP-C2 cells to T cell-mediated
killing [10]. The ability of enzalutamide to sensitize
tumor cells to immune-mediated killing enhanced the
efficacy of combination treatment with enzalutamide and a
therapeutic cancer vaccine, which translated to significant
improvement in overall survival of TRAMP mice (27.5 vs.
10.3 weeks) compared to ADT or vaccine therapy alone.
Here, we investigated whether ADT mediated
immunogenic modulation and rendered human prostate
carcinomas more sensitive to T cell-mediated killing.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a)
the novel immunomodulatory properties of ADT with
enzalutamide or abiraterone that render human prostate
carcinomas more sensitive to immune-mediated attack;
b) that the immunogenic modulation properties of ADT
are dependent on AR expression; c) that the molecular
mechanism of enzalutamide-mediated immunogenic
modulation in human prostate carcinomas includes
modulation of the expression of the antiapoptotic gene
NAIP (NLR family, neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein);
d) the functional importance of NAIP in rendering human
prostate tumor cells sensitive to immune-mediated killing;
and e) that enzalutamide renders prostate tumor cells
harboring AR amplification (the major mechanism of
ADT resistance) more sensitive to T-cell mediated killing.
These data further support the combination of ADT and
immunotherapy as a promising treatment for CRPC.

abiraterone. This clinically relevant dose was similar to or
lower than the median plasma concentration achieved in
humans [11]. Treatment with enzalutamide significantly
inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells (P < 0.01) (Fig.
1A), but did not inhibit the proliferation of PC-3 cells
(Fig. 1C). Similarly, abiraterone significantly reduced
the proliferation of LNCaP cells (P < 0.01), but did not
affect PC-3 cells (Figs. 1E and 1G). Neither enzalutamide
nor abiraterone affected the viability of LNCaP and
PC-3 cells, as measured by trypan blue exclusion after
3 days of drug exposure (insets, Figs. 1A, 1C, 1E, and
1G). To determine whether enzalutamide or abiraterone
mediated increased sensitivity to T-cell lysis, LNCaP
and PC-3 cells were treated with either drug in vitro and
used as target cells for MUC1-specific CTL-mediated
killing assays. Exposing LNCaP cells to enzalutamide
significantly enhanced their sensitivity to MUC1-specific
CTL-mediated lysis relative to tumor cells exposed to
vehicle (P < 0.01) (Fig. 1B). This killing was MHCrestricted as determined by HLA-A2 blocking (Fig. 1B
inset). Similarly, exposing LNCaP cells to abiraterone
significantly improved their sensitivity to MUC1-specific
CTL-mediated lysis compared to vehicle-treated tumor
cells (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1F). However, neither enzalutamide
nor abiraterone improved PC-3 cells’ sensitivity to MUC1specific CTL-mediated lysis (Figs. 1D and 1H) relative to
vehicle-treated tumor cells. These results suggested that
both enzalutamide and abiraterone mediated immunogenic
modulation in human prostate tumor cells, and this effect
was dependent on AR expression.

Immunogenic modulation by enzalutamide was
dependent on AR expression
To further confirm that immunogenic modulation
by enzalutamide is AR-dependent, we used a pair of
LNCaP cell lines stably expressing either control-shRNA
(expresses AR) or AR-shRNA cells (reduced or no AR
expression) [12]. In vitro, enzalutamide significantly
inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP control-shRNA (P <
0.01) (Fig. 2A) but did not affect the growth of LNCaP
AR-shRNA (Fig. 2B). Treatment with enzalutamide
significantly enhanced the sensitivity of LNCaP controlshRNA to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-specific CTLmediated lysis compared to vehicle-treated tumor cells (P
< 0.05) (Fig. 1C). The improved sensitivity to T-cell killing
mediated by enzalutamide was lost when tumors with
reduced expression of AR were used, as seen in Figure 2D,
where LNCaP AR-shRNA treated with enzalutamide or
vehicle demonstrated similar sensitivity to CEA-specific
CTL-mediated lysis. RT-PCR confirmed the reduced
expression of AR in LNCaP cells stably expressing ARshRNA compared to LNCaP expressing control-shRNA
(inset, Fig. 2B). Data from this study further confirmed
that increased sensitivity to T-cell killing by enzalutamide

RESULTS
ADT with enzalutamide or abiraterone inhibited
proliferation of AR+ prostate tumor cells and
increased their sensitivity to T-cell killing
Enzalutamide has previously been shown to induce
immunogenic modulation in TRAMP-C2 mouse prostate
carcinomas and to improve tumor cells’ sensitivity to
gp70-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) killing
in vitro [10]. Here we investigated the effect of ADT
with enzalutamide or abiraterone on human prostate
carcinomas. To determine the effect of ADT on tumor-cell
proliferation, 2 human prostate tumor-cell lines, LNCaP
(AR+, HLA-A2) and PC-3 (AR–, HLA-A24), were treated
in vitro with vehicle (DMSO) or 10 μM enzalutamide or

of PSA would inhibit tumor sensitivity to a PSA-specific
immune response in patients undergoing immunotherapy.
To determine the effect of enzalutamide on PSA levels,
LNCaP cells were treated in vitro with enzalutamide for
48 h. Real-time (RT)-PCR analysis showed a 5.5-fold
reduction in levels of PSA mRNA (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3A).

described. We hypothesized that modulation of apoptotic
genes might be part of the mechanism of action of ADTinduced CTL sensitization. We analyzed the expression of
96 genes involved in the process of apoptosis by RT-PCR
in LNCaP cells treated with enzalutamide or abiraterone
in vitro. Of these 96 genes, 3 were up-regulated and 12
were down-regulated > 2-fold by enzalutamide treatment.
Abiraterone treatment resulted in a > 2-fold up-regulation
of 11 genes and down-regulation of 14 genes. Further
analysis showed that only 9 genes were down-regulated by
both enzalutamide and abiraterone (Table 1). Among these

9 genes, one in particular, NAIP, was down-regulated 14fold by enzalutamide and 5-fold by abiraterone treatment.
To examine the reduced expression of NAIP in vivo, either
LNCaP or PC-3 cells were transplanted into nude mice.
Here, female mice were utilized to model a patient with
treatment mediated castrate levels of systemic testosterone
where the only source of testosterone would be from the
tumor itself. Once tumors reached 500 mm3, mice were
left untreated or treated with 10 mg/day of enzalutamide.
After 7 days of treatment, tumors were subjected to
immunohistochemistry staining to detect the presence and
intensity of NAIP expression. NAIP showed much less
intense staining in LNCaP tumors harvested from mice
treated with enzalutamide (Fig. 4A, right panel) compared
to LNCaP tumors harvested from untreated mice (Fig. 4A,
left panel). Positive pixel analysis (insets, Fig. 4A) from
2 independent experiments demonstrated a significant
2- to 8-fold reduction in tumor cells that strongly stained
for NAIP in enzalutamide-treated tumors compared to
untreated tumors (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the overall
population of enzalutamide-treated tumor cells expressing

NAIP significantly decreased by 1.5-fold (P < 0.01)
compared to untreated tumors, and there was a significant
2.2-fold increase (P < 0.01) in tumor area that did not
express NAIP in enzalutamide-treated tumors compared
to untreated tumors. In contrast, in mice harboring PC-3
tumors, treatment with enzalutamide did not mediate
significant changes in NAIP expression. Similarly intense
staining was seen in harvested tumors from enzalutamidetreated and untreated PC-3 tumors (Fig. 4B). Positive
pixel analysis demonstrated similar NAIP expression in
enzalutamide-treated and untreated PC-3 tumors (insets,
Fig. 4B).

The antiapoptotic gene NAIP is involved in the
molecular mechanism of enzalutamide-mediated
immunogenic modulation
To investigate the role of NAIP in immunogenic
modulation and subsequent improvement in CTL
sensitivity mediated by enzalutamide, we transiently

quantified by positive pixel quantification analysis. Staining intensities are depicted in pie charts. Numbers indicate percentage of cells

reduced the expression of NAIP in LNCaP cells in vitro
using NAIP siRNA, and confirmed this reduced expression
by western blot (inset, Fig. 5A). NAIP expression in
LNCaP cells transfected with NAIP siRNA was reduced
by 90% 48 h post-transfection, compared to LNCaP cells
transfected with control siRNA. In a parallel experiment,
we treated LNCaP cells with vehicle or enzalutamide
for 48 h and used these cells as targets for CEA-specific
CTL lysis. As shown in Figures 1A and 5A (left panel),
treatment with enzalutamide, previously shown to reduce
NAIP expression in vitro (Table 1) and in vivo (Fig. 4A),
significantly enhanced the sensitivity of LNCaP cells to
CEA-specific CD8+ T-cell killing (P < 0.0001). Similarly,
reduced expression of NAIP in LNCaP cells treated with
NAIP siRNA also significantly increased tumor cells’
sensitivity to T cell-mediated killing (P < 0.001) (Fig. 5A,
right panel). These data suggest that NAIP played a major
role in immunogenic modulation. Besides NAIP, another

gene of interest was death-associated protein kinase 1
(DAPK1), as enzalutamide down-regulated this gene 6.5fold (Table 1). To evaluate the importance of DAPK1,
we used DAPK1 siRNA to reduce the expression of
DAPK1 and found that reduced expression of DAPK1 did
not increase sensitivity of LNCaP cells to T-cell killing.
This suggested that DAPK1 did not play a major role in
enzalutamide-mediated immunogenic modulation (Fig.
5A, right panel).
To validate the importance of NAIP in the process of
immunogenic modulation, PC-3 cells previously shown to
be unaffected by enzalutamide (Fig. 1B) were transfected
with either control or NAIP siRNA for 48 h, and reduced
expression of NAIP was confirmed by western blot (inset,
Fig. 5B). PC-3 cells were also independently treated
with vehicle or enzalutamide. Forty-eight hours after
enzalutamide or siRNA treatment, the cells were used as
targets for MUC1-specific T-cell killing. As previously

PC-3 cells to T-cell killing (Fig. 5B, left panel). However,

in LNCaP/AR(cs) cells (inset, Fig. 6A). To determine the
effect of enzalutamide on cell proliferation, LNCaP and
LNCaP/AR(cs) cells were treated in vitro with vehicle
(DMSO) or 10 μM enzalutamide (Fig. 6B). Treatment
with 10 μM enzalutamide significantly inhibited the
growth of LNCaP cells (P < 0.01) (Fig. 6A), but did not
inhibit the proliferation of LNCaP/AR(cs) cells (Fig. 6C).
A higher, but still clinically feasible, dose of enzalutamide
(30 μM) inhibited the growth of LNCaP/AR(cs) cells by
50% while having no effect on the cells’ viability (Fig.
6C, inset). To determine whether enzalutamide could
increase the sensitivity of these ADT resistant cells to
T-cell killing, LNCaP/AR(cs) cells were treated with
10 μM enzalutamide in vitro and used as target cells in
either CEA- or PSA-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated killing
assays. Exposing LNCaP (Fig. 6B) and LNCaP/AR(cs)
(Fig. 6D) cells to 10 μM enzalutamide significantly
improved the cells’ sensitivity to T-cell killing (P <
0.01). Exposure of LNCaP/AR(cs) cells to 30 μM also

Enzalutamide improved the sensitivity of LNCaP/

CRPC is commonly associated with increased
expression of AR, arising from amplification or mutation
of the AR gene as well as other mechanisms [15].
Amplification of AR is arguably a major mechanism
of treatment resistance in CRPC [16]. We investigated
whether enzalutamide-mediated immunogenic modulation
could improve the sensitivity of prostate tumor cells
engineered to overexpress AR to T cell-mediated killing.
RT-PCR confirmed the overexpression of AR by 5-fold

significantly improved the cells’ sensitivity to T-cell
killing (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference
in the improved CTL sensitivity by treatment of the of
LNCaP/AR(cs) cells with 10 μM or 30 μM enzalutamide.

PSA levels (Fig. 3A), enzalutamide still improved prostate
tumor cells’ sensitivity to PSA-specific T-cell killing (Fig.
3B). This is particularly important because enzalutamide
is currently being tested in combination with PROSTVAC,
a cancer vaccine composed of a series of poxviral vectors
engineered to express PSA and a triad of human T-cell
costimulatory molecules [24]. Evaluation of immune
response from patients treated with PROSTVAC showed
that 57% of patients had a ≥ 2-fold increase in PSAspecific T cells [25]. Furthermore, patients who mounted
the greatest increase in PSA-specific T cells (≥ 6-fold)
had improved overall survival compared with patients
who did not mount as great an increase in PSA-specific T
cells [26]. Our data suggest that an enzalutamide-mediated
reduction in PSA level (i.e., reduction in CTL target)
would not reduce the sensitivity of prostate tumor cells to
PSA-specific immunity generated by the host. However,
in vitro treatment with enzalutamide did not increase the
sensitivity of prostate tumor cells to subsequent radiation
therapy (Suppl. Fig. 1).
The mechanism by which ADT, particularly with
enzalutamide, induces immunogenic modulation in
human prostate carcinomas appears to be distinct from
the molecular mechanism in murine cells. In murine
TRAMP-C2 cells, treatment with enzalutamide in vitro
up-regulated MHC-I and Fas [10]. Treatment with
enzalutamide induced a modest up-regulation of tumor
antigens and cell-surface molecules in AR-expressing
LNCaP human prostate carcinomas (Suppl. Table 1).
Up-regulation of cell-surface expression of APM and
calreticulin has also been described as a molecular
mechanism of immunogenic modulation [17], although
exposing LNCaP cells to enzalutamide in vitro did not
induce significant changes in expression of APM and
calreticulin (Suppl. Table 2). Treatment with either
enzalutamide or abiraterone in vitro, however, mediated
major changes in several apoptotic genes in LNCaP cells.
In particular, NAIP was markedly down-regulated in
LNCaP cells treated in vitro with enzalutamide (14-fold)
or abiraterone (5-fold) (Table 1). NAIP is a member of a
family of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) [27] that
directly inhibit cell death by inhibiting activated caspases.
IAPs may be overexpressed in a variety of malignancies
and may contribute to apoptosis resistance and drug
resistance, as well as tumor progression [28]. The main
function of NAIP is to protect motor neurons in the spinal
cord from apoptosis. Deficiency of NAIP is associated
with the most severe types of spinal muscular atrophy,
a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder [29]. Emerging
evidence suggests that increased expression of IAPs,
particularly NAIP, plays a role in the development of
drug- and hormone-resistant prostate cancer [30-36]. The
exact mechanism of NAIP involvement in prostate cancer
progression has not been determined. In addition, some
evidence suggests a link between nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) activity and NAIP expression [30], and that castration

DISCUSSION
Localized prostate cancer is treated with surgery,
radiotherapy, or watchful waiting, while recurrent disease
is further treated with ADT [1]. Most patients on ADT
eventually develop CRPC, characterized by a rise in PSA
and subsequent progression of disease despite castrate
blood levels of testosterone [14]. While it was initially
thought that CRPC was completely resistant to ADT,
several studies have demonstrated that CRPC remains
dependent on androgen signaling for growth and that
CRPC is sensitive to manipulation of androgen signaling
[3]. Enzalutamide and abiraterone are FDA-approved for
ADT in patients with metastatic CRPC. Both enzalutamide
and abiraterone have been evaluated in numerous clinical
trials that resulted in improved overall survival in patients
with metastatic CRPC [4-6, 9].
Immunogenic modulation describes a cascade
of phenotypic and molecular events occurring when
conventional therapies alter the phenotype of tumor cells,
rendering them more susceptible to immune-mediated
attack [9]. The molecular mechanisms of immunogenic
modulation include a) changes in the surface phenotype
of cancer cells, including exposure of calreticulin on
the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, b) downregulation of antiapoptotic and/or prosurvival genes, and
c) modulation of components of the APM [17-23]. The
numerous immunomodulatory effects of standard therapies
can be exploited to enhance the antitumor activity
induced by immunotherapy. Immunogenic modulation
by enzalutamide was first described in murine prostate
carcinomas [10], where enzalutamide up-regulated MHC-I
and Fas on the surface of tumor cells, thus improving
the cells’ sensitivity to T-cell killing. In those studies,
treatment with enzalutamide did not alter the number or
function of T cells. Enzalutamide-mediated immunogenic
modulation increased the efficacy of a therapeutic cancer
vaccine in TRAMP mice with spontaneous prostate
tumors, which subsequently translated to significant
improvements in overall survival [10].
Here, we investigated whether ADT, particularly
with enzalutamide, could induce immunogenic modulation
in human prostate carcinomas. Our findings demonstrated
that ADT with enzalutamide or abiraterone mediated
immunogenic modulation that rendered human prostate
tumor cells more sensitive to T-cell killing compared to
treatment with vehicle (Fig. 1). Immunogenic modulation
by ADT was dependent upon AR expression, since
improved tumor-cell sensitivity to T cells was only seen
in AR+ prostate cancer cells (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition,
we were able to show that despite mediating a reduction in

activity.
Increasing evidence suggests that modulation
of apoptotic genes may play a major role in sensitizing
tumor cells to T cell-mediated killing [23]. It was
previously shown that modulation of the Bcl-2 family of
apoptosis proteins increased the sensitivity of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma to T cell-mediated killing.
Here, we found that treatment with enzalutamide or
abiraterone reduced the expression of a different apoptosis
protein, NAIP, in vitro (Table 1). To confirm the reduced
expression of NAIP in vivo, nude mice were implanted
with LNCaP or PC-3 tumors and treated for 7 days with 10
mg/day of enzalutamide, a dose equivalent to a therapeutic
dose in humans [4, 10]. Immunohistochemistry analysis
of NAIP expression on LNCaP tumors harvested from
enzalutamide-treated mice confirmed a significant
reduction in NAIP expression post-enzalutamide treatment
compared to untreated tumors (Fig. 4A). The reduction
of NAIP was not seen in AR– PC-3 prostate tumors (Fig.
4B), further confirming that immunogenic modulation by
enzalutamide is strictly dependent upon AR expression
(Figs. 1 and 2). The functional importance of NAIP in
immunogenic modulation was confirmed by demonstrating
that a reduction in NAIP, whether mediated by treatment
with enzalutamide or NAIP siRNA, in either AR+ or AR–
prostate cancer cells, improved the cells’ sensitivity to T
cell-mediated killing (Fig. 5). These novel findings suggest
the importance of NAIP in sensitizing prostate cancer cells
to immune-mediated attack and warrant further studies in
other carcinomas.
A majority of prostate cancer patients treated with
ADT will eventually progress [37]. Several mechanisms of
resistance contribute to CRPC, such as AR amplification,
AR mutations, AR splice variants, post-translational
modifications of AR, AR-coregulators and collaborating
factors, and AR transcriptional activity [37]. We used
LNCaP/AR(cs) cells engineered to overexpress AR by
5-fold over parental LNCaP cells to identify the major
mechanism of immunogenic modulation. We were
thus able to show that enzalutamide, although it did
not affect the proliferation of LNCaP/AR(cs) cells, did
mediate immunogenic modulation, rendering the cells
more susceptible to T-cell killing despite increased AR
expression levels. FDA approval of Provenge [38], along
with encouraging clinical results for the therapeutic
vaccine PROSTVAC [39] and immune checkpoint
inhibitors such as PDL-1 and CTLA-4 [24, 40], represent
significant milestones in the field of immunotherapy.
Findings from this study now suggest that enzalutamide
could potentially be used as an immunomodulatory agent
in combination with these immunotherapeutic agents, even
in patients who have developed treatment resistance.
To our knowledge, we report here for the first time a)
the properties of ADT with enzalutamide and abiraterone
that induce immunogenic modulation and render human
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

prostate carcinomas more sensitive to immune-mediated
attack; b) that the properties of ADT that induce
immunogenic modulation are strictly dependent on AR
expression; c) the molecular mechanism of enzalutamidemediated immunogenic modulation in human prostate
cancer cells is modulation of the expression of the
antiapoptotic gene NAIP; d) the functional importance of
NAIP in rendering human prostate cancer cells sensitive
to immune-mediated killing; and e) that enzalutamide
improves the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells harboring
AR amplification, the major mechanism of ADT
resistance, to T cell-mediated killing.
In reported clinical trials, more than 30% of patients
did not respond to enzalutamide and continued to have
rising PSA levels (5, 19). Moreover, nearly all patients
who initially respond to ADT will ultimately develop
ADT resistance [37]. Findings from this study provide a
further rationale for combination strategies that include
ADT, particularly with enzalutamide, and immunotherapy
as a promising treatment option for prostate cancer, and
especially for patients who have had minimal to modest
responses to enzalutamide or have developed ADT
resistance. A clinically active therapeutic vaccine such as
PROSTVAC-VF is an attractive option in combination
with enzalutamide for treatment of CRPC. In a phase II
trial of PROSTVAC-VF in metastatic CRPC patients (n
= 125), the vaccine was well tolerated and was associated
with a 44% reduction in death rate and an 8.5-month
improvement in median overall survival compared to
placebo [39]. Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of
PROSTAC-VF plus enzalutamide in CRPC [41] and in
nonmetastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer [42] are
currently underway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tumor cells
LNCaP (HLA-A2, AR+) and PC-3 (HLA-A24,
AR ) prostate adenocarcinoma cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and
maintained in the recommended medium. LNCaP cells
stably expressing control or AR shRNA were generously
provided by Dr. Paul Rennie (Vancouver Prostate Centre,
Vancouver, BC). The stably transfected LNCaP cells were
maintained as previously described [12]. LNCaP cells
stably overexpressing AR (LNCaP/AR(cs)) were a gift
from Dr. Charles Sawyers (Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center, New York, NY) and were maintained in
the recommended medium with 10% FBS [43].

Tumor-cell proliferation

Enzalutamide diet

To evaluate the effect of enzalutamide or abiraterone
on cell proliferation, LNCaP or PC-3 prostate cancer cells
were treated in vitro with vehicle (DMSO) or 10 μM
enzalutamide or abiraterone (Selleckchem, Houston, TX)
in complete media. Cells were harvested 24, 48, or 72 h
after exposure, and the total number of adherent viable
cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Viability
was confirmed by 7AAD staining.

For use in an animal model, enzalutamide, which is
administered orally to humans, was formulated into rodent
diet. Enzalutamide admixed with Research Standard Diet
(Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) was fed to
animals at a dose level equivalent to the therapeutic level
for humans, previously determined to be 10 mg/day [4,
10].

Immunohistochemistry

CD8+ CTL lines

All mice were housed and maintained in
microisolator cages under specific pathogen-free
conditions and in accordance with the guidelines of
the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care. All experimental studies were
carried out with the approval of the NIH Intramural
Animal Care and Use Committee. Nude mice (Charles
River, Wilmington, MA) were implanted s.c. in the
right flank with 5 x 106 LNCaP or PC-3 prostate tumor
cells. When tumors reached a volume of 500 mm3, mice
were either left untreated or treated with 10 mg/day of
enzalutamide for 7 days. Mice were then sacrificed and
tumors were surgically removed, fixed, and prepared
in paraffin sections. NAIP expression was detected
via immunohistochemistry using a rabbit polyclonal
antibody to NAIP (Novus Bio, Littleton, CO) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Entire slides were
digitally scanned by an Aperio ScanScope CS system and
analyzed by Aperio ImageScope Viewer software (Aperio
Technologies Inc., Vista, CA). Statistical analysis was
performed using 3–7 murine tumors, each prepared as a
complete stained tumor section. Positive tumor regions
were determined using the Positive Pixel Count v9
algorithm. Negative controls included omission of primary
antibody with PBS and matched rabbit isotype antibody.
In all cases, necrotic areas of tumor were excluded from
analysis.

HLA-A2-restricted CEA-specific CTLs recognize
the CEA peptide epitope YLSGANLNL (CAP-1) [4446]. HLA-A2-restricted PSA-specific CTLs recognize the
PSA peptide epitope VLSNDVCAQV [46]. The MUC1specific CTL lines recognize the MUC1 peptide epitope
ALWGQDVTSV (HLA-A2-restricted) or KYHPMSEYAL
(HLA-A24-restricted) [47].

Cytotoxicity assays
To determine T cell-mediated killing, cytotoxicity
assays were performed as previously described [10].
Tumor cells were treated with vehicle or 10 μM
enzalutamide or abiraterone. At the indicated times,
cells were harvested and counted. Equal numbers of
effector target cells from all treatment were plated with
respective cytotoxic T cells. The E:T ratio was held at
30:1. and adherent cells were used as targets in a standard
cytotoxicity assay using indium-111 (GE Health Care,
Vienna, VA).

RNA isolation, quantitative real-time PCR and
apoptosis array
Total RNA was isolated from tumor-cell lines
using the RNeasy Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Advantage
RT-for-PCR Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). cDNA
(2.5–10 ng) was used in quantitative RT-PCR reactions
using probes specific for AR (Hs00901571_m1), PSA
(Hs02576345_m1), and GAPDH (4326317E). Relative
mRNA expression levels of 96 genes involved in
apoptosis were assessed using an apoptosis PCR array
(SA Biosciences, Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. RT-PCR was performed on the 7300 RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).
Where indicated, values were calculated as expression
relative to GAPDH, as previously described [48].

RNA interference (siRNA)
siRNA duplexes targeting NAIP sequences and
control were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD).
LNCaP or PC-3 cells were transfected with NAIP siRNA
or control siRNA according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The interference of NAIP expression was
confirmed by RT-PCR using TaqMan probes for NAIP
(Hs03037952_m1, Applied Biosystems) or western blot.

Western blot
For protein blotting, tumor cells were lysed in
RIPA buffer modified with 1 mM PMSF (Cell Signaling

Technology, Beverly, MA). Proteins (20–40 μg) were
resolved using 4%–12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies specific for
AR and NAIP were acquired from Abcam (Cambridge,
MA). Blots were incubated with antirabbit IRDye
secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln,
NE), and detected using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System (LI-COR Biotechnology). Intensity of individual
bands was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD).
