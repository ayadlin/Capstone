ABSTRACT:
Trastuzumab has been shown to improve the survival outcomes of HER2 positive
breast cancer patients. However, a significant proportion of HER2-positive patients
are either inherently resistant or develop resistance to trastuzumab. We assessed the
effects of neratinib, an irreversible panHER inhibitor, in a panel of 36 breast cancer
cell lines. We further assessed its effects with or without trastuzumab in several
sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells as well as a BT474 xenograft model. We
confirmed that neratinib was significantly more active in HER2-amplified than HER2
non-amplified cell lines. Neratinib decreased the activation of the 4 HER receptors
and inhibited downstream pathways. However, HER3 and Akt were reactivated at
24 hours, which was prevented by the combination of trastuzumab and neratinib.
Neratinib also decreased pHER2 and pHER3 in acquired trastuzumab resistant cells.
Neratinib in combination with trastuzumab had a greater growth inhibitory effect
than either drug alone in 4 HER2 positive cell lines. Furthermore, trastuzumab in
combination with neratinib was growth inhibitory in SKBR3 and BT474 cells which had
acquired resistance to trastuzumab as well as in a BT474 xenograft model. Innately
trastuzumab resistant cell lines showed sensitivity to neratinib, but the combination
did not enhance response compared to neratinib alone. Levels of HER2 and phosphoHER2 showed a direct correlation with sensitivity to neratinib. Our data indicate
that neratinib is an effective anti-HER2 therapy and counteracted both innate and
acquired trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer. Our results suggest
that combined treatment with trastuzumab and neratinib is likely to be more effective
than either treatment alone for both trastuzumab-sensitive breast cancer as well as
HER2-positive tumors with acquired resistance to trastuzumab.

INTRODUCTION

resistant to trastuzumab, the combination of lapatinib
with capecitabine increased median time to progression
compared to capecitabine alone [23]. As a result, lapatinib
with capecitabine is currently licensed for use in patients
who have previously failed trastuzumab. Clinical trials
have shown that the addition of trastuzumab and lapatinib
to chemotherapy achieved a higher pathological complete
response than either trastuzumab or lapatinib alone [24,
25].
To further enhance HER2 inhibition, irreversible
TKIs, such as neratinib, afatinib and dacomitinib have
been developed. Neratinib, is an irreversible inhibitor of
EGFR, HER2 and HER4 tyrosine kinase activity [26]
shown to have promising preclinical activity against
HER2-overexpressing cell lines [27]. Indeed, it is
currently undergoing several phase 3 clinical trials [28,
29]. Since we have previously shown that trastuzumabinduced activation of all HER receptors may contribute
to trastuzumab resistance [19], we assessed the effects
of neratinib, to determine if it can improve response and
overcome resistance to trastuzumab, in sensitive and
resistant HER2 amplified breast cancer cells.

HER2 is a member of the human epidermal growth
factor receptor (HER) family which also includes EGFR
(HER1), HER3 and HER4 [1]. The HER proteins are
receptor tyrosine kinases which consist of an extracellular
domain, an α-helical transmembrane region and an
intracellular tyrosine kinase domain [2]. The crystal
structure of HER2 shows that the extracellular domain
is constitutively in an ‘open’ conformation, ready for
dimerization [3]. Although HER2 has no known ligand,
it is the preferred heterodimerization partner of the other
HER receptors and is involved in the lateral transmission
of signals between other HER family receptors [4]. The
HER2/HER3 dimer is considered to be the most potent
with regards to strength of interaction, ligand-induced
tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream signaling [5,
6]. HER2 signaling promotes cell proliferation via the
RAS-ERK pathway and inhibits cell death via the PI3KAkt-mTOR pathway [7]. Over-expression of HER2 occurs
in approximately 20% of breast cancers and is associated
with a poor prognosis [8, 9].
Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody
which binds to extracellular domain IV of HER2. It
has been shown to increase survival in HER2 positive
metastatic and early breast cancer patients, especially
when given in combination with chemotherapy [10, 11].
Trastuzumab is thought to exert its anti-tumor activity
partly by accelerating the internalization and degradation
of HER2 and thus blocking downstream signaling. In
addition, it may also act by mediating antibody-dependentcellular cytotoxicity [12]. However, many patients do not
respond to trastuzumab and the majority who initially
respond, progress within a year of initiating therapy [13].
Understanding the mechanisms responsible for resistance
to trastuzumab is therefore crucial for the development of
new therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcome.
Based on preclinical studies, mechanisms of
primary and acquired resistance to trastuzumab include
(i) activation of PI3K/Akt signaling due to PTEN loss or
PI3KCA mutations [14, 15], (ii) the presence of p95HER2,
a truncated form of HER2 [16]; (iii) interaction of HER2
with other receptors such as IGF-IR and c-Met [17, 18]
and (iv) activation of HER receptors by an Akt negative
feedback loop [19]. Other proposed mechanisms include
the constitutive activation of the autophagy-related gene
12 (ATG12) [20], the presence of trastuzumab-refractory
breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) [21], and the steric
hindrance caused by association of HER2 with other cell
surface signaling proteins, i.e. integrins β1, CD44, MUC1
and MUC4 [22].
In an attempt to circumvent resistance to
trastuzumab, anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
were introduced. The first TKI to show activity in HER2
positive breast cancer patients was the dual EGFR/HER2
reversible TKI, lapatinib [23]. In patients who were

RESULTS
Neratinib sensitivity in a panel of breast cancer
cell lines
We determined sensitivity to neratinib in a panel
of 36 breast cancer cell lines, including HER2 positive,
luminal and basal-like cell lines (Figure 1A left panel,
Supplementary Table 1). The HER2 positive cell lines
(n=12) were significantly more sensitive to neratinib, than
either the triple negative (n=15, p=0.0002) or luminal
cell lines (n=9, p=0.0055) (Figure 1A, right panel).
One luminal cell line however, MDA-MB-175, showed
sensitivity to neratinib (IC50 value < 0.001 µM), while one
of the HER2 positive cell lines, UACC-732, was relatively
insensitive to neratinib (IC50 value = 0.65 µM). The IC50
values for neratinib were lower than those previously
published for lapatinib in the panel of HER2 positive
cell lines [30]. The results were also confirmed by direct
comparison of the two drugs in SKBR3 and BT474 cells,
and both cell lines showed greater sensitivity to neratinib
than lapatinib (data not shown).

Neratinib decreases pHER2 in a dose-dependent
manner in HER2 amplified breast cancer cells
As the HER2 positive cell lines were significantly
more sensitive to neratinib, we investigated the effect
of neratinib on HER2 signalling in two HER2 positive
breast cell lines. One hour of neratinib (2 nM) treatment
did not decrease pHER2 levels despite inhibition of pAkt

and pERK (Figure 1B). However, pHER2 was inhibited
after 24 hours (Figure 1B). A dose dependent inhibition
of pHER2 was observed with increasing concentrations
of neratinib in both cell lines (Figure 1B). Although
total HER2 levels were not altered by treatment with
neratinib for 1 hour, by 24 hours HER2 level was reduced
in response to 50 nM neratinib in SKBR3 and was
undetectable in BT474 cells.
Reactivation of pERK was observed after 24
hours of neratinib treatment in SKBR3 cells, although
the highest concentration of neratinib (50 nM) inhibited
this reactivation (Figure 1B). The reactivation of pERK
was not seen in BT474 cells, which are more sensitive
than SKBR3 cells (Figure 1B). The results suggest
that neratinib effectively inhibits HER2 activation and
downstream signaling in HER2 positive breast cell lines.

and

To assess the effect of trastuzumab with neratinib,
SKBR3 and BT474 cells were treated with 40 µg/
ml trastuzumab, 2 nM neratinib or the combination for
six days. The combination treatment was significantly
more effective in reducing cell numbers compared to
trastuzumab alone (p< 0.001) or neratinib alone (p<
0.05) in both cells lines (Figure 2A). To understand the
enhanced response to the combination, a time-course
experiment was performed to assess the effect of the
combination on HER receptor activation and downstream
signaling. Figure 2B shows the results after three days
of treatment in the SKBR3 cells (data for BT474 cells
are not shown as there were insufficient cells left after
three days of the combination treatment). Trastuzumab

decreased pHER3 and pAkt only minimally after 1 hour
and did not decrease pEGFR, pHER2, pHER4 or pERK
at the timepoints tested (Figure 2B and Supplementary
Figure 1). In contrast, 1-hour neratinib treatment
inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and
HER4 as well as pAkt and pERK levels (Figure 2B and
Supplementary Figure 1). However, reactivation of HER3
and Akt phosphorylation was observed after 24 hours
(Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 1). The combination
of trastuzumab and neratinib prevented reactivation of
pHER3 and pAkt and downregulated EGFR and HER2 at
3 days (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 1).

We tested the effect of neratinib on acquired
trastuzumab resistant BT474 (BT474R) and SKBR3
(SKBR3R) cells. With increasing doses, neratinib inhibited
pHER2 and pHER3 as well as downstream pathways
in both cell lines at 1 hour and 1 day (Figure 3A). We
also assessed the effect of trastuzumab withdrawal and/
or neratinib treatment in resistant cells. In the BT474R
and SKBR3R cells, withdrawal of trastuzumab increased
the cell count significantly, compared to trastuzumab
replacement or continuous treatment with trastuzumab

numbers to a greater extent than trastuzumab replacement,

treatment to 7 additional HER2 amplified breast cancer
cell lines, including cell line models of innate trastuzumab
resistance. In the MDA-MB-361 and EFM-192-A cell
lines, which are moderately sensitive to trastuzumab,
the combination of neratinib and trastuzumab showed
greater inhibition of growth than either of the drugs alone
(Figure 4A). However in the trastuzumab-resistant cell
lines (JIMT1, MDA-MB-453, HCC1419, HCC1954,
UACC732) the combination treatment showed no
enhancement compared to neratinib alone (Figure 4B and

Response to neratinib correlates with HER2 and
pHER2 in HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines

Correlation between the effect of neratinib on cell
signaling and biomarkers

In order to identify potential predictive biomarkers
for neratinib sensitivity in HER2 positive breast cancer,
we correlated the neratinib IC50 values with a panel of
potential biomarkers previously measured by O’Brien
et al [30] to determine their relationship with response/
resistance to lapatinib and/or trastuzumab. In the panel
of 11 HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines, higher
baseline levels of both HER2 and phosphorylated
HER2 significantly correlated with response to neratinib
(p=0.038 and 0.042 respectively) (Figure 5A). Neratinib
sensitivity was not significantly associated with p95HER2, EGFR, HER3, Akt, ERK, PTEN, PI3K mutation
status or ER status (Supplementary Table 2).

In order to examine potential pharmacodynamic
biomarkers of response to neratinib, we tested the
effects of neratinib (200 nM) on HER2 and downstream
signalling in a panel of HER2 amplified cell lines, with
varying sensitivity to neratinib (Figure 5B). In all cell lines
tested, neratinib significantly reduced phosphorylation of
HER2, although the level of reduction did not correlate
with sensitivity to neratinib (Figure 5C). Neratinib
inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and ERK to a greater
extent in cell lines which are more sensitive to neratinib
(pAkt: p=0.026; pERK: p=0.012).

xenograft tumors showed no statistically difference in
the levels of membrane HER2 and pHER2 between any
of the groups although the trastuzumab and neratinib
combination treatment showed the lowest IRS scoring
for pHER2 staining (Figure 6C and 6D). In contrast to
HER2, staining for pHER3 was weak but the lowest IRS
scoring was seen in the combination arm (Supplementary
Figure 3B). Consistent with the cell line data, neratinib
and trastuzumab inhibited pAkt to a greater extent than
trastuzumab monotherapy but not neratinib monotherapy
(Figure 6E and Supplementary Figure 3C). Neratinib
treatment showed little effect on ERK phosphorylation
whereas trastuzumab alone and the combination treatment
decreased pERK staining in the xenograft tumors
(Figure 6F and Supplementary Figure 3C). However, the
differences in pHER3, pAkt and pERK IHC staining were
not statistically significant.

We further examined the effect of neratinib and/or
trastuzumab in a BT474 xenograft model and showed that
the combination treatment resulted in the greatest tumour
inhibition (Figure 6A), correlated with the final tumor
volume in vivo among the four groups (vehicle control
vs combination group, p< 0.05; all other comparisons,
p > 0.05) (Supplementary Figure 3A left panel). The
combination treatment also resulted in the smallest tumor

0.05; all other comparisons, p > 0.05) (Supplementary
Figure 3A right panel) and with higher percentage of
connective tissue ex-vivo compared to vehicle control (p<

ERK and Akt, reflecting its immediate inhibitory effect on
the tyrosine kinase activity of all the HER receptors. In
contrast, trastuzumab did not decrease phosphorylation
of EGFR, HER2, HER4 and ERK, reflecting the different
mechanisms of action of the drugs. The xenograft
experiment also showed that the combination treatment
lead to the greatest decrease in pHER2 with decreased
activation of pAkt and pERK, correlating with increased
efficacy compared to the single agents, in xenograft
models. Although trastuzumab has been previously
shown to downregulate HER2 [12, 19, 31], this effect
was not seen with either trastuzumab, neratinib or the
combination treatment in our xenograft study. This
may be because there was a significant heterogeneity in
HER2 staining between xenograft tumor areas and the
dose of trastuzumab used in this study was lower than in
previously reported xenograft experiments [31], which
may affect the amount of HER2 downregulation and
assessment [32].
Clinically, the withdrawal of trastuzumab treatment
in patients who are no longer responding is controversial
[33], partially due to the cost of continuing trastuzumab
treatment [34]. Our data revealed that the withdrawal
of trastuzumab from the trastuzumab-resistant cell lines
resulted in a significantly increased cell count compared
to continuation of trastuzumab treatment. Furthermore,
the combination of trastuzumab and neratinib was
significantly more effective than neratinib alone even in
the presence of trastuzumab resistance. This is supported
by recent data which showed that lapatinib in combination
with trastuzumab significantly improved overall survival
and progression-free survival compared to lapatinib alone
despite disease progression on prior trastuzumab-based
therapy [35, 36].
Neratinib has shown promising activity in several
clinical trials, particularly in HER2 positive breast
cancer patients [29, 37]. Neratinib and trastuzumab in
combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy showed clinical
benefit in patients who had been heavily pre-treated with
anti-HER2 agents and chemotherapy, with a mean of 4
prior regimens [38]. A phase II multi-centre randomized
study of neratinib in combination with weekly paclitaxel
with or without trastuzumab followed by doxorubicin
and cyclophosphamide (AC) as neoadjuvant therapy
for women with HER2-positive locally advanced breast
cancer (NSABP FB-7) is currently ongoing. As well as
neratinib, other irreversible TKIs including dacomitinib
(PF-00299804) and afatinib (BIBW2992) are also
being tested in clinical trials. Afatinib monotherapy was
shown to have promising clinical activity in extensively
pretreated HER2-positive breast cancer patients who had
progressed following trastuzumab treatment [39].
It has been previously shown that EGFR and HER2
inhibitors failed to suppress HER3 phosphorylation due
to ligand-dependent activation of HER3 via ADAM17
through an Akt feedback loop [19, 40, 41]. This could
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

be an important drug resistance mechanism for EGFR
and HER2 inhibitors. We showed that although neratinib
effectively inhibited phosphorylation of all HER receptors
for up to 24 hours, reactivation of HER3 and Akt occurred
within 3 days. However, the combination of trastuzumab
and neratinib significantly delayed reactivation of HER3
and Akt compared to neratinib alone. In contrast a recent
study showed that dual inhibition with trastuzumab
and lapatinib or trastuzumab and pertuzumab does not
completely eliminate HER3 function [42]. It would be
interesting to determine if the reactivation of HER3
observed with neratinib is also induced by ADAM17
mediated heregulin release [19]. This possibility might be
investigated using an ADAM17 inhibitor or a monoclonal
antibody to HER3.
Although neratinib is a panHER inhibitor, we
showed that it is selectively active in HER2 amplified
compared to non-amplified breast cancer cell lines.
However, some of the HER2 amplified cells listed in
Supplementary Table1, including MDA-MB-361 and
MDA-MB-453, have been classified as IHC 2+ or HER2
negative [43-46], as they express slightly lower levels
of HER2 protein, at an expression level that is nearer
to the original FDA definition of HER2 positivity [47].
Since HER2 testing results may be variable according to
the methods or assays of testing [48], it is not surprising
that some of these cells have been classified differently.
Nevertheless, some of the moderate HER2 expressing
breast cancer cells including MDA-MB-453 and MDAMB-361 show greater sensitivity to neratinib than
trastuzumab. In NSABP B-41, lapatinib in combination
with chemotherapy induced a greater pathological
complete response than that of trastuzumab in combination
with chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with IHC 2+
although the number of patients in each arm was small
[49]. Thus it may be important to assess the effect of
neratinib in patients whose tumors express lower levels of
HER2 protein (IHC 2+).
Despite the frequent overexpression of EGFR in
triple negative breast tumors and cell lines, they were
less sensitive to neratinib than HER2 amplified cells.
The luminal cell line, MDA-MB-175, which showed
significant sensitivity to neratinib has previously been
shown to be dependent on heregulin-mediated activation
of HER2/HER3 signaling and are also more sensitive to
pertuzumab treatment than trastuzumab [50]. In addition,
neratinib but not lapatinib, has been shown to be active
against HER2 somatic mutations present in about 1-3% of
HER2 negative breast cancer patients [51]. This suggests
that there may be both overlapping and non-overlapping
mechanisms of resistance to different HER2 inhibitors.
There is a need to further understand the biomarkers that
can predict response to neratinib in different breast cancer
subtypes.

HER2 correlated with response to neratinib in the panel of

HER2 protein and mRNA levels have also been shown
to predict response to dacomitinib [52]. The reduction in
pAkt and pERK in response to neratinib treatment was
also correlated with sensitivity to neratinib. Other potential
biomarkers which may be predictive of response to
neratinib, and other HER2 targeted therapies, include the
dimerization states of the HER receptors [53], and levels
of protein tyrosine phosphatases, such as PTPN9 which
has been shown to regulate EGFR and HER2 activation
[54, 55].
Like lapatinib [30], neratinib can overcome
trastuzumab resistance in cell line models of acquired
trastuzumab resistance and can enhance response to
trastuzumab in trastuzumab sensitive cell lines. However,
neratinib also shows activity in some cell lines which are
innately resistant to lapatinib which suggests that neratinib
may have clinical benefit in patients who do not respond
to trastuzumab and/or lapatinib. The challenge will be
to identify predictive markers to select those patients
with HER2 positive breast cancer who may benefit from
neratinib treatment but not from trastuzumab or lapatinib.
The results of this study provide a rational for clinical
trials of neratinib in combination with trastuzumab and
of neratinib alone (with chemotherapy) in patients whose
disease has progressed on trastuzumab and/or lapatinib
treatment.

% PSF (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA, USA). All cell
lines were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 ˚C with 5
% CO2 apart from MDA-MB-134, MDA-MB-157, MDAMB-175, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-415, MDA-MB-436,
UACC812 and UACC893 which were grown at 37 ˚C in
the absence of CO2.
Stock solutions of lapatinib (10 mM) (Sequoia
Research Products) and neratinib (10 mM) (supplied by
Pfizer) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
Trastuzumab was purchased from St Vincent’s University
Hospital and Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust.

Proliferation assays

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Proliferation was assessed using cell counting and acid
phosphatase assays.

Cell lines and generation of trastuzumab resistant
cell lines

For cell counting experiments, cells were seeded in
duplicate at 2 – 3 x 104 cells per well, depending on the
cell line, in 24 well plates. The cells were treated for 5
days unless otherwise stated. On the concluding day of
the experiments, the cells were washed with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) before trypsinization and counted
using ISOTON solution on the Coulter Z2 particle counter
(Beckham Coulter, Inc). Growth inhibition relative to
control treated cells was determined. The log of drug
concentration was then plotted against the log growth
inhibition and IC50 values were calculated using linear
regression analysis as previously described [30].
For the acid phosphatase assay, 5 x 104 cells/well
for MDA-MB-361 cells, and 3 x 104 cells/well for the
other cell lines were seeded in triplicate 96-well plates.
Following overnight incubation at 37°C, drugs were added
at the appropriate concentrations and incubated for 5 days
at 37°C. Cells were washed once with PBS and acid
phosphatase substrate (7.25 mM p-nitrophenyl-phosphate
(Sigma) in sodium acetate buffer) was added to each
well and incubated at 37 ºC for 1 hour. The reaction was
stopped by adding 50 µl 1 M NaOH and absorbance was
read at 405 nm with 620 nm as the reference wavelength.

SKBR3 and BT474 were obtained from CRUK
London Research Institute Cell Services, and were
cultured in RPMI and DMEM respectively; both were
supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin.
Trastuzumab-resistant BT474 and SKBR3 cell lines were
generated as previously described [19]. In addition to
SKBR3 and BT474, the following panel of breast cancer
cell lines was used in this study: EFM192A, HCC1419,
MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, SUM190, SUM225,
UACC732, UACC812, UACC893, CAMA1, EFM19,
KPL1, MCF7, MDA-MB-134, MDA-MB-175, MDAMB-415, T47D, ZR751, HCC1569, HCC1954, BT20,
BT549, CAL51, HCC38, HCC70, HCC1143, HCC1187,
HCC1395, HCC1806, HCC1937, JIMT1, MDA-MB157,
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-435, MDAMB-436. All cell lines used were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA)
unless otherwise stated. EFM192A, KPL1, EFM19 and
CAL51 were supplied by the German Tissue Repository
DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). SUM190 and SUM225
were obtained from the University of Michigan (Ann

Pharmacodynamic biomarkers of neratinib response
in a panel of cell lines

The flank of BALC/nu/nu mice was injected with
107 BT474 cells in Matrigel and left to grow (under the
project license PPL 30/2771). Mice were provided with
5 µg/ml oestradiol in the drinking water for the duration
of the experiment. When tumors reached an average
size of 125 mm3, the mice were divided into 4 groups,
keeping average tumor size similar between groups. The
control group of 4 mice was treated with vehicle (0.5%
methocellulose - 0.4% polysorbate-80 (Tween 80)) by
gavage daily and sterile PBS intraperitoneally (IP) twice
weekly. The treatment groups consisted of 5 mice, treated
with: (i) vehicle containing neratinib 10 mg/kg by gavage
daily and IP PBS twice a week; (ii) trastuzumab 10 mg/
kg (twice weekly IP) and vehicle by gavage daily; (iii)
trastuzumab 10 mg/kg by IP twice a week with neratinib
(10 mg/kg) by gavage daily. The treatment continued
for 17 days (5 trastuzumab treatments) and the mice
were sacrificed 3 hours after the last neratinib treatment.
Tumours were weighed and collected in 4% formalin to
fix over night at 4 °C. The samples were then embedded
in paraffin for immunohistochemical analysis.

After neratinib treatment for 24h, cells were washed
with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma) containing
protease inhibitors, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF) and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. After 20
min incubation on ice, lysate was passed through a
21-gauge needle and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min
at 4ºC. Protein quantification was carried out using the
bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce).
Forty µg of protein were solubilized in sample
buffer (250 mM Tris–HCl; 10% sodium dodecyl
sulphate (SDS); 5% beta-mercaptoethanol; 30%
glycerol; 0.02% bromophenol blue), heated to 95 ºC for
5 min and separated using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels
(Lonza). Proteins were transferred to Hybond enhanced
chemiluminescence nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham,
Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The membrane
was blocked with 5% milk in PBS–0.1% Tween at room
temperature for 1h. After overnight incubation at 4ºC
with primary antibody (anti-HER2, Calbiochem, all
other antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology) in 5%
blocking solution milk in PBS–0.1% Tween, three washes
with PBS–0.1% Tween were carried out, followed by
incubation at room temperature with secondary antibody
in 5% blocking solution milk in PBS–0.1% Tween for 1
hour. Following three washes with PBS–0.1% Tween and
one PBS wash, protein bands were detected using Luminol
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA).

Western Blotting
Neratinib dose escalation studies in naïve and acquired
resistant SKBR3 and BT474 cells
SKBR3 and BT474 cells were seeded and left to
adhere overnight. Cells were treated as indicated before
they were placed on ice and washed with PBS. Lysis
buffer (10 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 10 mM Na2P2O7 and 100 mM NaF with 1% Triton
X and 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail) was added to the
cells and the cells scraped off the plates. Samples were
centrifuged at 4°C to remove the insoluble cell pellets.
Bradford Protein Assay was then performed to determine
protein concentration. Equal amounts of protein sample
were prepared in 4X SDS with 10% beta-mercaptoethanol,
boiled for 10 minutes at 95°C. Samples were then loaded
into a NuPage 4-12% gel and ran at 100V for 15 minutes
then 130V until completion. The proteins were semi-dry
transferred to a PVDF membrane for two hours at 12V.
The membrane was blocked in 3% BSA in PBS-Tween
(0.2%) for a minimum of one hour. The membrane was
then incubated with primary antibody in 3% BSA in PBSTween overnight at 4°C. All antibodies were purchased
from Cell Signalling Technologies. The membrane was
then washed four times with 1% milk in PBS-Tween
(0.2%) at room temperature and incubated with secondary
antibody in 5% milk PBS-Tween (0.2%) for one hour
before washing four times in 1% milk PBS-Tween. Bands
were then visualized and the blot developed using an
enhanced chemiluminescent system (ECL, GE Heathcare).

Immunohistochemisty and immunoreactive (IRS)
scoring
Formalin-fixed BT474 xenograft samples were
embedded in paraffin and 4 µm thick sections were cut
for immunohistochemical staining. The sections were
dewaxed and rehydrated prior to antigen retrieval using
Tris/EDTA at pH9 for HER2 and phosho-HER2, or citrate
buffer at pH6 for the other antibodies. Sections were
blocked using horse serum (Vector laboratories) overnight
at 4oC. The following day, sections were incubated with
primary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature,
followed by 3 washes with PBS. The sections were then
incubated with a horseradish peroxidise-coupled antirabbit secondary antibody (Vector laboratories) for 30
minutes at room temperature. Visualization of staining was
performed using a diaminobenzidine (DAB) peroxidase
substrate (Vector Laboratories). Counterstaining was
performed using Haemocytoxin prior to the mounting
using aqueous-based mounting media (Aquatex). Levels
of staining were scored blindly. The scoring criteria is
composite score based on staining intensity (SI) and
percentage of positive cells (PP) using the formula IRS
= SI × PP. The staining intensity (SI) was determined as
1602

Oncotarget 2013; 4:

0 = negative; 1 = weak; 2 = moderate; and 3 = strong
and the percentage of positive cells (PP) was defined as
0, <1%; 1, 1%–10%; 2, 11%–50%; 3, 51%–80%; and 4,
>80% positive cells.

Statistical analysis
Mann-Whitney U test was used to investigate the
association between response to neratinib and breast
cancer cell line subtype. The differences in the means
between different conditions or groups (n>2) were
analysed by Anova with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison
test and p < 0.05 was taken to be statistically significant.
Relationships between neratinib response and HER2,
pHER2, p95, EGFR, HER3, Akt, ERK, PTEN, PI3K and
ER (from O’Brien et al [30]) were examined using the
Spearman’s Rank correlation and Mann-Whitney U test on
StatView for Windows (version 5.0.1) (SAS Institute, Inc).
