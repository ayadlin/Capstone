Abstract
Emerging evidence indicates the presence of tumor-initiating cells (TIC) or cancer stem cells in osteosarcoma. However, no study has shown specific markers to identify osteosarcoma TICs with in vivo
tumor formation ability. Additionally, there has been a lack of investigations gauging the contribution of
osteosarcoma TICs to metastatic and drug-resistant properties. In this study, we have identified mouse
and human osteosarcoma TICs using mesenchymal stem cell markers CD117 and Stro-1. These markers were
preferentially expressed in spheres and doxorubicin-resistant cells. Both mouse and human cells expressing
these markers were sorted and analyzed for their abilities of tumor formation with as few as 200 cells, selfrenewability, multipotency, drug resistance, metastatic potential, and enrichment of a metastasis-associated
marker (CXCR4) and a drug resistance marker (ABCG2). CD117+Stro-1+ cells efficiently formed serially transplantable tumors, whereas CD117−Stro-1− cells rarely initiated tumors. On orthotopic injections, CD117+Stro-1+
cell-derived tumors metastasized at a high frequency. Further, CD117+Stro-1+ cells showed high invasive and
drug-resistant properties and were efficiently enriched for CXCR4 (20–90%) and ABCG2 (60–90%). These
results suggest possible mechanisms for the high metastatic and drug-resistant properties of osteosarcoma
TICs. In summary, CD117 and Stro-1 identify osteosarcoma TICs associated with the most lethal characteristics of the disease—metastasis and drug resistance—and these markers offer candidates for TICtargeted drug delivery aimed at eradicating osteosarcoma. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4602–12. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Osteosarcoma, the most common bone cancer, is the second highest cause of cancer-related death in children and
adolescents. Approximately 90% of cases show micrometastasis at diagnosis, making systematic chemotherapy the first
choice of treatment (1). Despite intensive chemotherapy, the
survival rate for high-grade osteosarcomas remains only 50%
to 80% (2). The inadequacy of current treatments may result
from the inability to effectively target tumor-initiating cells
(TIC) or cancer stem cells of osteosarcoma (3, 4). TICs represent a small fraction of the cellular population of a tumor,
having the ability to generate new tumors identical in cellular
composition to the tumor of origin. Given that normal adult
stem cells are capable of becoming TICs through the acquisition of mutations in several types of cancer, markers for

stem cells have been widely used to identify TICs (4–7). However, the origin of the TICs remains controversial (8).
TICs have been proposed to be responsible for cancer
metastasis because cancer cells use the same molecular
machinery for invasion and metastasis as normal stem cells
do for homing or mobilization (9). The chemokine SDF1/
CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 are involved in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization and homing as well as
breast cancer cell migration and metastasis (10). CXCR4 is
also shown to be enriched in CD133 + glioblastoma TICs
(11). Recently, CXCR4+ pancreatic TICs showed a markedly
increased metastatic potential compared with CXCR4− TICs
(12). Thus, increasing evidence suggests a crucial role of
CXCR4 in the metastatic property of TICs.
Another important property of TICs is resistance to anticancer drugs (13). This phenotype is mainly mediated by
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as MDR1/
ABCB1 and BRCP1/ABCG2. These transporters also allow
cells to efflux Hoechst 33342 dye, a property used to identify
a subpopulation of cells, called the side population (SP;
ref. 14). The SP cells are shown to be enriched with tumorigenic stem-like cancer cells (15). Recently, ABCB5, another
ABC member, has been reported to identify melanoma stem
cells (16). These findings indicate the significant involvement
of ABC transporters in the drug-resistant property of TICs.
Despite numerous efforts to identify osteosarcoma TICs,
no report has yet successfully shown markers to identify
them, specifically about in vivo tumor formation (17–20).

Characterization of Osteosarcoma Tumor-Initiating Cells

To discover novel and effective therapies for eradicating
osteosarcoma, we have isolated a subpopulation of cells with
TIC properties from mouse and human osteosarcoma cell
lines using mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers because
of its mesenchymal origin. As few as 200 cells expressing
CD117 and Stro-1 efficiently initiated tumors in immunocompromised mice. Additionally, CD117+Stro-1+ cells showed
high metastatic and drug-resistant properties with enrichment of cells positive for CXCR4 and ABCG2.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Mouse K7M2, human KHOS/NP (R-970-5), and MNNG/HOS
osteosarcoma cell lines were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (21). Primary mouse osteosarcoma
cell lines 318-1 and P932 were previously established (22, 23).
BCOS is a primary cell line established by Dr. Pochampally's
laboratory from an untreated osteosarcoma-bearing 25-yearold male patient undergoing biopsy in accordance with
the protocol approved by Tulane University Health Sciences
Center Institutional Review Board. The tumor was located in
the left radius, and the histologic subtype was high-grade
osteoblastic osteosarcoma.
Sphere culture
For sphere formation studies in Fig. 1A, five cells per well
were plated on 96-well ultralow attachment plates under
serum-free sphere-specific conditions described by Gibbs
and colleagues (18). These spheres were processed to form
the next generation of spheres every 14 days. Third-generation
spheres were used for all the following experiments.
Differentiation studies
Cells (15, 000) were plated on 96-well plates. When cells
reached confluency, they were cultured in adipogenic differentiation medium for 5 days. Cells were fixed with 10%
buffered formalin and stained with Oil Red O (Sigma Biochemicals; ref. 24). For osteogenic differentiation, cells were
cultured in osteogenic differentiation media for 3 weeks
and stained using the Von Kossa Staining kit (Polysciences;
ref. 25).
Tumor sample preparation for flow cytometry, cell
sorting, and serial transplantability
Tumors were minced and incubated with 3 mg/mL collagenase/dispase solution (Roche Applied Science). Isolated
cells were cultured for 1 day in complete media to ensure
the removal of dead and nonadherent cells. To eliminate
nonspecific binding of antibodies and dead cells for flow
cytometry and cell sorting, mouse FC Block and 7-aminoactinomycin D staining (BD Biosciences) were used, respectively. Flow cytometric acquisition was performed using
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using BD CellQuest Pro. Isotype controls were used for all experiments.
Cell sorting was performed using FACSAria (BD Biosciences)
at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center
Alcohol Research Center.

Tumor formation and metastasis studies
Cultured cells including spheres were dissociated into
single-cell suspensions using nonenzymatic cell dissociation
solution (Sigma Biochemicals). Live cells were counted by
trypan blue staining, suspended in 4.5 mg/mL Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) in HBSS, and s.c. injected into NIH-III nude mice.
For orthotopic injections, cells were injected into femoral
bone marrow space of anesthetized nonobese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. The injection
entry point was sealed using bone wax (World Precision
Instrument). Mice were monitored daily until 4 months after
injection or when tumors reached 1 cm in diameter. Data were
accumulated from at least three independent experiments.
Tumor nodules >1 mm in diameter were taken for pathologic
examination. When tumor nodules were identified at secondary sites apart from a primary injection site and diagnosed as
osteosarcoma, the nodules were determined as metastases.
Invasion assay
Invasion assays were performed for monolayer (Mo),
CD117−Stro-1− [double negative (DN)], and CD117+Stro-1+
[double positive (DP)] cells using growth factor–reduced
Matrigel-coated 24-well Transwell chambers (BD Biosciences).
To recover cells from sorting stress, DN and DP cells were cultured for 48 hours in complete medium before performing
assays. Cells (3,000 per well) were plated in culture media containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in duplicates. Culture
media containing 10% FBS were used as a chemoattractant.
Invading cells were fixed after 19 hours and stained with
Diff-Quik Stain Set (Dade Behring). Cells on the entire filter
were counted to determine relative invasive potential.
Drug sensitivity assessment
318-1 and K7M2 (Mo, DN, and DP) cells were cultured for
2 days in complete media to recover cells from sorting stress.
Cells (5,000 per well) were cultured in 96-well plates for 1 day
and then treated with increasing concentrations of doxorubicin (0–8.0 μmol/L) for 24 hours. Cell viability was measured
by MTT assay (26) to determine the mean IC50 values.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (27). Paraffin-embedded tissues sections (5 μm) were
deparaffinized, rehydrated, and processed for antigen retrieval using citrate buffer solution. Following hydrogen peroxide
treatment, samples were incubated with appropriate antibodies. Signal detection was performed using the Vectastain
Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Stro-1 immunohistochemistry was performed using the BenchMark XT (Ventana Medical Systems,
Inc.). For signal detection, the ultraView Universal DAB Detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems) was used, followed
by counterstaining with hematoxylin.
Statistical analyses
Each experiment was performed independently at least
thrice. Values were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical significance (P < 0.05) was determined using Student's t test.

Results
Murine osteosarcoma sphere cells efficiently initiate
tumors and are enriched for stem cell markers CXCR4,
ABCG2, CD117, and Stro-1
TICs are capable of forming spheres when cultured without serum and in an anchorage-independent manner (28).
We first tested if mouse osteosarcoma cell lines contained

a cellular population possessing this property using an established cell line (K7M2) and two primary cell lines (318-1
and P932). After 14 days of culture in sphere-specific conditions, cells from all three cell lines formed spheres but
with different numbers and sizes (Fig. 1A). This suggests
that each cell line contained a different number of TICs
or, alternatively, TICs with different growth properties.
Next, we examined the tumor-forming ability of sphere
cells. Single-cell suspensions from third-generation spheres
and Mo from 318-1 and K7M2 cell lines were s.c. injected
into NIH-III nude mice. As few as 200 cells from spheres
successfully initiated tumors (two of five in 318-1 and two

of four in K7M2 cells), and >60% of mice injected with 500
and 2,000 sphere-derived cells developed tumors in both
cell lines (Fig. 1B; Table 1A). In contrast, 200 and 500 Mo
cells did not initiate tumors, and only a few mice injected
with 2,000 Mo cells developed tumors (one of five in 318-1
and two of four in K7M2 cells; Table 1A).
CXCR4 and ABCG2 are linked to metastatic and drugresistant properties of TICs in diverse tumor types (10, 29).
Thus, we wanted to examine if spheres were enriched with
cells expressing these markers. Less than 10% and 1% of
Mo for all three cell lines expressed CXCR4 and ABCG2,
respectively (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the rare existence of
ABCG2+ cells in Mo, Hoechst 33342 dye-excluding SP cells
were present at only 1.7 ± 0.5% in P932 cells (Supplementary

Fig. S1A). Compared with Mo, spheres derived from all three
cell lines contained significantly more CXCR4+ cells (P <
0.005). ABCG2+ cells were minimally enriched only in 318-1
and P932 sphere cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 1C; Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Cells from spheres also showed the ability to differentiate into both osteogenic and adipogenic lineages (Supplementary Fig. S1C). These results suggest that spheres
from murine osteosarcoma cell lines are enriched with cells
having TIC properties.
Given that osteosarcoma TICs are enriched in spheres and
share certain properties of MSCs, MSC markers that are predominantly expressed in spheres could be used to identify
potential osteosarcoma TICs. Our flow cytometric analyses
revealed that spheres contained higher percentages of cells

expressing CD117/c-kit and Stro-1, but not markers such as
CD44, CD105, and CD49b, compared with Mo (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S1D). Cells DP for CD117 and Stro-1 were
present at 1% to 3% of Mo and at 6% to 14% of sphere cells
in all three cell lines, suggesting the possibility of using these
markers as a strategy to identify osteosarcoma TICs.
Cells expressing CD117 and Stro-1 show higher
resistance to doxorubicin
TICs from certain tumors show chemotherapy resistance
(16, 30); hence, we additionally examined which subpopulations of MSC marker-expressing cells could survive when Mo
cells were exposed to doxorubicin, a commonly used chemotherapy drug for the treatment of osteosarcoma. Cells surviving doxorubicin treatment contained higher percentages of
cells expressing CD117 and Stro-1 compared with control
DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Because two independent strategies to enrich TICs resulted in
essentially the same consequence, we hypothesized that
CD117 and Stro-1 can be used to isolate subpopulation of osteosarcoma cells possessing TIC properties. To investigate the
drug-resistant property of cells expressing these markers, we
first sorted Mo for CD117+Stro-1+ (DP) and CD117−Stro-1−

(DN) populations. Purities for DP and DN populations were
constantly more than 85% and 90%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Mo, DN, and DP cells from 318-1 and K7M2 cell
lines were exposed to increasing concentrations of doxorubicin to determine the mean IC50 (Fig. 2B). The IC50 value for
DP cells was 2.2 μmol/L compared with 1.5 μmol/L in Mo
and DN cells in 318 cells, whereas that in K7M2 DP cells
was 2.6 μmol/L compared with 1.5 μmol/L in Mo and DN
cells. Thus, in both cell lines, DP cells showed a higher resistance to doxorubicin than Mo and DN cells.
CD117+Stro-1+ cells efficiently initiate tumors with a
high frequency of metastasis
The most significant property of TICs is their ability to
initiate tumors. We therefore s.c. injected DP and DN cells
in immunocompromised mice. In each cell line, cells were
independently sorted more than thrice. In 318-1 and K7M2
cells, the majority of mice injected with as few as 200 DP
cells formed tumors, whereas only one mouse injected
with 2,000 318-1 DN cells showed tumor formation (Fig. 3A;
Table 1B). This DN-derived tumor was considerably smaller
than those with 2,000 DP cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
For P932 cells, 2,000 DP cells were required for tumor

three different 318-1 DP-derived tumors, we observed tumor
formation in 67% of mice (n = 9) injected in triplicate with

500 DP cells. These results suggest the serial transplantability
of DP cells.
Next, we tested the ability of DP cells to initiate osteosarcomas in their own niche by performing orthotopic injections

and seven of eight mice with 2,000 DP injection formed tumors. These tumors were confirmed as osteosarcomas that

To investigate the metastatic potential of DN and DP cells,
we counted the number of metastatic nodules in tumorbearing mice. Because 2,000 DN cells were insufficient to
initiate tumors, we increased the number of DN cells injected

to 20,000 and 200,000. This higher number of DN cells efficiently generated tumors (five of seven and four of four mice
with 20,000 and 200,000 cells, respectively; Table 1C; Supplementary Table S1). Notably, to generate tumors of ∼1 cm
in diameter, a 3-month period was required for 20,000 DN
cells compared with the 2-month period for 2,000 DP cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Slow-growing tumor formation using higher number of DN cells may indicate the possibility of either contamination of DP cells in DN population
during cell sorting procedures or the presence of other
populations with tumor-initiating potential. Nonetheless,
the average number of lung nodules from 200 and 2,000 DP
cell-derived tumors was 29 per tumor-bearing mouse
(n = 11), whereas that of 2,000 to 200,000 DN cell-derived
tumors was only 6 (n = 10; Table 1C; Supplementary
Table S1). To further confirm the high metastatic potential
of DP cells, we performed in vitro invasion assays using
318-1 Mo, DN, and DP cells (Fig. 3C). DP cells showed a 2-fold
higher invasive potential compared with that of Mo, whereas
DN cells showed a similar invasive potential to that of Mo,
supporting our in vivo observation of DP cells possessing
high metastatic potential.
We further wanted to compare the expression patterns of
stem cell markers CD117, Stro-1, ABCG2, and CXCR4 in primary tumors with those in lung metastases. We performed
immunohistochemistry of primary tumors and their lung
metastases from five mice with intrafemoral injections of
318-1 DP cells (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig S3C). Although
we detected cells positive for all four markers in both primary and metastatic tumors, the intensely stained cells were
more frequent at the metastatic sites compared with those
in their primary sites (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig. S3C).
These markers did not show any specific intratumoral
localization patterns at both primary and metastatic sites
(Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig. S3C). These results support previous findings that high expression of TIC markers positively
correlates with cancer metastasis (31–33).
CD117+Stro-1+ population is multipotent and enriched
for CXCR4 and ABCG2
TICs are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into
multiple cell populations (3). Thus, we examined for the
MSC marker profile of 318-1 DP-derived tumors and compared it to that of Mo. The percentages of CD117+Stro-1+
cells in 318-1 DP-derived tumors were similar to those of
Mo (Fig. 4A), indicating that DP cells can generate other
cellular populations in tumors. Percentages of other MSC
markers, including CD44, CD105, and CD49b, were also similar
between Mo and DP-derived tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4).
We further confirmed successful differentiation of DP cells
into both osteogenic and adipogenic lineages, suggesting the
multipotent nature of these cells (Fig. 4B).
Given that DP cells showed a high metastatic potential,
we investigated percentages of CXCR4+ cells in this population using flow cytometric analyses. Strikingly, >70% of DP
cells from all three lines expressed CXCR4, whereas only a
few CXCR4+ cells were present in Mo and DN cells (Fig. 4C).
Single-positive CD117+Stro-1− (CD117) cells also contained

4610

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

30% to 75% of CXCR4 + cells; however, enrichment of
CXCR4+ cells in CD117−Stro-1+ (Stro-1) cells was observed
only in 318-1 cells.
Because DP cells showed resistance to doxorubicin, we
next examined for the percentage of ABCG2+ cells. Similar
to the results of CXCR4, >60% of DP cells from all three lines
expressed ABCG2 compared with <2% of Mo and DN cells.
Approximately 30% to 75% of single-positive CD117+Stro-1−
(CD117) cells expressed ABCG2, whereas only 0% to 25%
were ABCG2+ in CD117−Stro-1+ (Stro-1) cells (Fig. 4D). In
summary, mouse osteosarcoma DP cells showed TIC properties as indicated by their efficient tumor-initiating ability,
self-renewability, multipotency, high metastatic potential,
and drug resistance.
Human osteosarcoma CD117+Stro-1+ cells also show
TIC properties
The major objective in establishing a mouse system is its
translation into human research. We therefore investigated
the TIC properties of DP cells isolated from the established
human osteosarcoma cell lines (KHOS and MNNG/HOS)
and a primary cell line (BCOS) that we derived from an
osteosarcoma patient. Isolated DP and DN populations
were approximately 85% and 95% in purities, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S5A). On s.c. injections of these populations into NIH-III nude mice, seven of eight mice with
500 KHOS DP cells, seven of eight mice with 1,000 BCOS
DP cells, and three of four mice with 1,000 MNNG/HOS DP
cells initiated tumors (Fig. 5A; Table 1D). In contrast, only
one of eight mice with 500 KHOS DN cells, one of eight
mice with 1,000 BCOS DN cells, and no mice injected with
1,000 MNNG/HOS DN cells formed tumors (Table 1D).
Moreover, the KHOS DN-derived tumor was significantly
smaller in size compared with those from DP cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Serial transplantability of DP cells was
tested by injecting 500 DP cells in duplicate after reisolating them from three different tumors induced by 500
KHOS DP cells. We found tumor formation in four of six
injections. Additionally, DP cells were capable of differentiating into adipogenic lineage (Supplementary Fig. S5C). These
results suggest that human osteosarcoma DP cells also
represent TICs. We then examined expression profiles
of CXCR4 and ABCG2 in the DP population of KHOS and
BCOS cells. Whereas only a few CXCR4+ cells were present
in Mo and DN cells, ∼25% of DP cells from both cell lines
contained CXCR4+ cells (Fig. 5B). Unlike the mouse system,
only CD117−Stro-1+ (Stro-1) cells contained high percentages
of CXCR4+ cells similar to that of DP cells, whereas CXCR4+
cells were not enriched in CD117+Stro-1− (CD117) cells. About
ABCG2 expression, ∼90% of DP cells from both cell lines
contained ABCG2 + cells, whereas only a few Mo and DN
cells were positive for ABCG2. Contrary to the mouse system,
enrichment of ABCG2+ cells in the CD117−Stro-1+ (Stro-1)
population was more efficient (70–80%) than that in
the CD117+Stro-1− (CD117) population (30–50%; Fig. 5C).
Although enrichment profiles of CXCR4 and ABCG2 were
different between mouse and human, our results indicate
that human osteosarcoma DP cells also show TIC properties

Characterization of Osteosarcoma Tumor-Initiating Cells

with high enrichment of metastasis-associated and drug
resistance–associated markers.

Discussion
Markers for the identification of osteosarcoma TICs
showing in vivo tumor formation have not yet been reported. We have selected MSC markers CD117 and Stro1 due to their preferential expression in spheres and in
cells surviving doxorubicin treatment. Our data strongly
suggest that CD117+Stro-1+ (DP) cells from both mouse
and human osteosarcoma cell lines are enriched with TICs.
CD117/c-kit is a 145-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein and
is expressed in both HSCs and MSCs. CD117 has been suggested as a prognostic marker for osteosarcoma because
its higher expression, mainly due to gene amplification
rather than mutations, is associated with a poorer outcome in patients, metastasis, and recurrence of the local
disease (34–37). Considering that CD117 can be a marker
for osteosarcoma TICs associated with metastasis and
drug resistance, overexpression of CD117 in patients with
worse prognosis observed in these reports may indicate
that these osteosarcomas contain a high population of
TICs. Stro-1, originally identified as an antigen expressed
by stromal elements in human bone marrow, is exclusively
present in MSCs (38). However, the clinical relevance of
Stro-1 in cancer remains to be explored. Given that TICs
are considered to be derived from their normal adult stem
cells, we believe that osteosarcoma TICs also carry over
the properties of MSCs, including expression of cell surface
markers. Nonetheless, it remains unknown if CD117 or
Stro-1 plays an active role in the properties of osteosarcoma TIC, in addition to solely serving as its marker. Further
studies are required to clarify this issue.
We show that CD117+Stro-1 + (DP) cells showed high
metastatic potential compared with CD117−Stro-1− (DN)
cells by both intrafemoral injection studies and in vitro invasion assays. We also showed that DP cells were enriched
with cells expressing a metastasis-associated stem cell
marker (CXCR4). This observation agrees with the previous
studies, suggesting that CXCR4 plays a crucial role in the
metastatic property of TICs (12). Because CXCR4 is also
linked to poor prognosis or metastasis of osteosarcoma
(39, 40), our findings suggest that targeting DP cells may
help prevent metastasis. In addition to the high metastatic
property, DP cells exhibited a higher IC50 value for doxorubicin treatment than DN cells, showing their drug-resistant
property. We also observed that DP cells were enriched
with ABCG2+ cells at >60% of the population in all cell
lines examined. ABCG2 is a major contributor of the SP
phenotype, which is well correlated with the drug-resistant
property of cells (19, 41, 42), and its expression is associated with a poor clinical outcome or resistance to therapy in
several types of cancer (43, 44). Therefore, our observation
of enrichment of ABCG2+ cells in DP cells may suggest
the contribution of ABCG2 to the drug-resistant property
of osteosarcoma TICs. Thus, significant enrichment of cells
positive for both CXCR4 and ABCG2 in DP population

www.aacrjournals.org

suggests possible mechanisms for the high metastatic and
drug-resistant properties of osteosarcoma TICs.
Our flow cytometric analyses using triple staining for
CD117, Stro-1, and CXCR4 or ABCG2 revealed that expression profiles of CXCR4 and ABCG2 for single-marker
CD117+Stro-1− (CD117) or CD117−Stro-1+ (Stro-1) cells were
not identical between mouse and human osteosarcoma
cell lines. Because CD117+Stro-1− (CD117) cells, but not
CD117−Stro-1+ (Stro-1) cells, displayed similar expression
profiles of CXCR4 and ABCG2 to those of DP cells in mouse
osteosarcoma cell lines, CD117 may play a more critical role
in TIC properties than Stro-1 in mouse osteosarcoma. On
the other hand, in human cell lines, CD117−Stro-1+ (Stro-1)
cells showed similar expression profiles of CXCR4 and ABCG2
to those of DP cells. Thus, in human osteosarcoma, Stro-1 may
contribute to TIC properties more than CD117. These results
suggest that each marker, CD117 and Stro-1, has a differential
influence on TIC properties between the two organisms. Further investigation is required to decipher the role of the individual stem cell markers.
Although our study delineates CD117 and Stro-1 as markers for isolating osteosarcoma TICs, we do not exclude
the possibility that other markers also identify them. Our
intrafemoral injection studies show the slow-growing tumor
formation using a higher number of DN cells. This observation may suggest the presence of other populations
with tumor-initiating potential, but we cannot exclude the
possibility of contamination of DP cells in the DN population
during cell sorting procedures. Nonetheless, our study is
the first to show isolation of an osteosarcoma subpopulation
with TIC properties, including efficient tumor-initiating
ability, self-renewability, multipotency, high metastatic
potential, and drug resistance. Further, this study identifies
CD117 and Stro-1 as potential candidates for TIC-targeted
drug delivery, which will accelerate the development of
new therapies that are associated with the most lethal
characteristics of osteosarcoma—metastasis and chemotherapy resistance.
