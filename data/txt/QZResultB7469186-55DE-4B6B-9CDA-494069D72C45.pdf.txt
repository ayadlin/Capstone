Abstract
Traditionally, the goal of nanoparticle-based chemotherapy has been to decrease normal tissue toxicity by
improving drug speciﬁcity to tumors. The enhanced permeability and retention effect can permit passive
accumulation into tumor interstitium. However, suboptimal delivery is achieved with most nanoparticles
because of heterogeneities of vascular permeability, which limits nanoparticle penetration. Furthermore, slow
drug release limits bioavailability. We developed a fast drug-releasing liposome triggered by local heat that has
already shown substantial antitumor efﬁcacy and is in human trials. Here, we show that thermally sensitive
liposomes (Dox-TSL) release doxorubicin inside the tumor vasculature. Real-time confocal imaging of doxorubicin delivery to murine tumors in window chambers and histologic analysis of ﬂank tumors illustrates that
intravascular drug release increases free drug in the interstitial space. This increases both the time that tumor
cells are exposed to maximum drug levels and the drug penetration distance, compared with free drug or
traditional pegylated liposomes. These improvements in drug bioavailability establish a new paradigm in drug
delivery: rapidly triggered drug release in the tumor bloodstream. Cancer Res; 72(21); 5566–75. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
A major challenge in chemotherapy is to change the biodistribution of drugs to reduce free drug toxicity and favor
tumor accumulation. Attempts to overcome this challenge have
focused on nanoparticles, such as liposomes (1, 2) and other
self-assembling systems (3–5). The hyperpermeability of tumor vasculature led to the hypothesis that liposomes and other
particles could accumulate more speciﬁcally in tumor tissue
than normal tissue by passive extravasation; the process was
termed the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect
(6, 7). As an extension, additional tumor speciﬁcity could be

achieved with active ligand targeting. While these methods
have been shown to increase the amount of drug delivered,
there is growing evidence (6, 8–10) that many nanoparticle
delivery systems are too large to extravasate in human tumors.
Even when tumor vasculature is permeable to 100-nm liposomes, the distribution pattern is extremely heterogeneous and
susceptible to large inter- and intratumoral variances in vascular permeability and ligand expression (9, 11). Furthermore,
the relatively large size of nanoparticles limits their penetration
depth to 1 to 2 cell layers from blood vessels (6, 8–10, 12).
Nanoparticles also release drug slowly; thus, tumor cells may
not be exposed to concentrations high enough to result in cell
death (9, 13). Consequently, a gap exists between shielding
normal tissue from drug and delivering the drug at therapeutic
concentrations to all tumor cells. One solution would be to
initiate local drug release from a nanoparticle in the tumor's
bloodstream, where it can diffuse into the tissue, down its
concentration gradient. This would avoid the reliance on
particle extravasation.
We developed thermally sensitive liposomes (Dox-TSL) that
rapidly release doxorubicin in response to 40 C to 42 C heat (14–
20). Preclinical work showed tumor drug levels up to 30 times
higher than free drug and 3 to 5 times greater than traditional
liposomes; the enhanced delivery was linked to superior antitumor efﬁcacy (15, 21). Interestingly, timing of liposome injection
versus application of hyperthermia altered antitumor efﬁcacy in
rat ﬁbrosarcomas (22). When Dox-TSLs were administered after
tumors were preheated, tumor drug concentrations were doubled as compared with Dox-TSL administration before hyperthermia. We speculated that the increased drug delivery in the

Intravascular Liposomal Release Promotes Drug Penetration

ﬁrst case was due to intravascular release during peak plasma
concentrations of liposomal drug.
This result led to the current hypothesis, the mechanism of
drug delivery from Dox-TSL þ heat is due to perivascular drug
penetration as a result of rapidly triggered intravascular liposomal drug release. This method maintains the toxicity beneﬁts of sequestering drug until it reaches the tumor where it
releases drug with a localized trigger. Intravascular release
from TSLs overcomes heterogeneity in vascular permeability
and limited penetration associated with the EPR effect. In this
context, TSLs serve as a continuous intravascular infusion of
drug, which originates at the tumor site. This creates high
intravascular drug concentrations that drive drug uptake by
cells and increase drug penetration further from vessels.
While the intravascular release hypothesis has existed since
the early work on TSLs in the 1970s (23–25), it has not been
shown in vivo; the enhancement in drug delivery has only been
shown by an increase in overall tumor drug concentrations, not
drug penetration. Herein, we present the ﬁrst in vivo evidence
of intravascular drug release using intravital confocal microscopy and illustrate that intravascular drug release improves
drug penetration to reach more tumor cells than either the EPR
effect with pegylated liposomes or with free drug.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Human squamous cell carcinoma (FaDu) cells were grown
as monolayers in tissue culture ﬂasks containing minimal
essential Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin
(Gibco). Cell cultures were kept at 37 C with 5% CO2 in air.
B16BL6 melanomas were transplanted to window chambers
from donor animals. Both cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection.
Dorsal skin-fold window chamber
All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with
Duke University (Durham, NC) or Erasmus Medical Center's
(Rotterdam, The Netherlands) Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee guidelines. Either nude athymic mice (FaDu
tumor model) or eNOS-GFP transgenic mice (B16BL6 melanoma model) were used. The eNOS-GFP transgenic mouse
model contains the eNOS-GFP fusion protein expression,
restricted to the endothelial cells. Mice were anesthetized and
then underwent dorsal window chamber implantation as
described previously (26). Additional details are in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Liposome preparation
This study used 2 different liposome formulations, the primary TSL formulation, used for evaluating drug kinetics and
penetration, and a second formulation prepared in Rotterdam,
Netherlands to corroborate intravascular release of drug in
eNOS-GFP mice. The ﬁrst liposome preparation consisted of
99.9 mol% of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (MSPC), and 1,2distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N- [methoxy
(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000) with correspond-

ing mole percentages of 85:9.8:5.2, along with 0.5 mol% ﬂuorescein N-(ﬂuorescein-5-thiocarbamoyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoylsn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine triethylammonium salt
(DHPF). TSLs were similarly prepared at the Erasmus Medical
Center but with the mole percentages 90:10:4 (DPPC:MSPC:
DSPE-PEG2000). Doxorubicin loading was achieved by the
remote pH gradient method (27). Further details are provided
in Supplementary Methods.
Confocal image acquisition
Nude mice with dorsal window chambers were anesthetized
[Nembutal; 85 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.)] and positioned on
a custom-designed microscope stage and heating device for
localized heating to the window chamber between 40.7 C to
41.8 C (or 34 C–36 C in unheated controls; ref. 12). Core body
temperature was maintained with a warming pad set at 37 C.
The tail vein was cannulated and 0.1 mL of 10 mg/mL 2-MDa
rhodamine-labeled dextran (Molecular Probes) was injected
i.v. A z-stack of images was collected with a LSM 510 laserscanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) through approximately
50 to 100 mm of tissue, using a 543 excitation laser and LP 560
emission ﬁlter. A plane approximately halfway through the zstack image was chosen for continual sequential imaging of
either doxorubicin and dextran (when free doxorubicin was
injected) or doxorubicin and ﬂuorescein-labeled liposomes
(when Dox-TSL was injected); both at 6 mg/kg. Images were
obtained every 5 seconds for 20 minutes, including 20 seconds
of background images. Four treatment groups were evaluated
doxorubicin þ heat (n ¼ 5), doxorubicin  heat (n ¼ 5), DoxTSL þ heat (n ¼ 6), and Dox-TSL  heat (n ¼ 4).
For visualization of the intravascular doxorubicin release in
the eNOS-GFP mice, animals were anesthetized with isoﬂuorane (Nicholas Piramal (I) Limited) and placed on a thermal
stage at 37 C. Heating of the chamber to target tumor temperatures of 41 C was accomplished by an external circular
resistive electric heating coil attached to the glass of the
back side of a glass coverslip (28). The doxorubicin dose was
5 mg/kg. Representative pictures out of 4 independent experiments applying Dox-TSL þ heat are shown. Additional details
are provided in Supplementary Methods.
Confocal image analysis
Data were preprocessed to segment vascular and extravascular spaces, and doxorubicin ﬂuorescence was normalized
and corrected for bleed-through. Additional analysis details
are provided in Supplementary Methods. Drug penetration
depth was determined by converting the 3D vascular mask
from the rhodamine–dextran images into a distance map that
related the distance of each pixel from the nearest vascular
structure in 3D space. A distance of 0 corresponded to the end
of the intervascular space. Boundary effects were removed by
truncating the dataset by 50 pixels on all sides in the x–y plane.
Fluorescence intensities for pixels located at each distance
from the nearest vessel were then averaged.
Histology image analysis
Athymic nude mice were injected with 1  106 FaDu cells into
the right leg. Tumors were 8 to 12 mm in diameter when used
(ulcerated tumors excluded) in 4 treatment groups Dox-TSL þ

þ heat (n ¼ 8). Mice were anesthetized (85 mg/kg Nembutal i.p.)
and ﬁtted with a tail vein catheter and a rectal temperature
monitoring probe to measure core body temperature during
water bath heating (see Supplementary Methods).
Tumor-bearing legs were preheated for 10 minutes before
injection to reach thermal steady state. Mice were then
injected i.v. with 15 mg/kg Dox-TSL, free doxorubicin, or Doxil
at 2 mg/mL to ensure an injected volume per mouse less than
0.2 mL. Following injection, the animals were heated for an
additional 20 minutes, then removed and allowed to cool for
10 minutes before sacriﬁce (Doxil animals sacriﬁced 24 hours
posttreatment). Tumors were snap frozen over liquid nitrogen.
Entire tumor sections were imaged for doxorubicin and
stained and imaged for CD31 using a Zeiss Axioscope 2
scanning stage with 20 objective and Metamorph image
software (see Supplementary Methods).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means with SDs. Statistical differences
between groups were computed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test. AUC0–20 values are expressed as median  SDs of the
product %Ivasc,max  seconds.

Results
Drug delivery through intravascular release
Free drug administration was compared with intravascular
release of drug from Dox-TSL. Heat showed little inﬂuence on
the accumulation of free doxorubicin (red signal), which
diffused out of the vascular space (green signal) and into the

extravascular space immediately after injection (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Movies S1 and S2). However, declining vascular
concentration caused the blood vessel compartment to switch
from a drug source to a drug sink, resulting in reabsorption of
drug into the vasculature more quickly than it can diffuse and
enter cells. This leads to limited tumor cell exposure. Thus,
extravascular drug levels quickly declined, with a precipitous
drop in apparent drug accumulation within 5 minutes of
injection, in line with previous observations (13, 29). In Fig.
1, free drug reabsorption into the vasculature is reﬂected by a
decrease in drug (shown in red) in the extravascular region. As
the reabsorption occurs more slowly than the blood ﬂow rate
in the nearby vessels, any drug that is reabsorbed into the
vascular compartment is immediately removed from the
tumor area, explaining why the vessels do not seem to have
more drug during reabsorption.
Dox-TSL's prolonged plasma half-life maintains high intravascular concentrations, resulting in increased accumulation
of drug with time in the interstitial space (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Movies). In the absence of heat, doxorubicin remains
contained within the liposome and conﬁned to blood vessels.
To investigate intravascular release, ﬂuorescently labeled liposomes were imaged to determine the contribution of extravasation versus intravascular release (Fig. 2). Overlap between
green lipid label and red ﬂuorescence of doxorubicin is seen as
yellow. The intravascular signal remains strongly yellow
throughout the 20 minutes, whereas the red signal increases
in the interstitial space. In contrast, there is very little yellow
color in the interstitial space during heating. The lack of
overlap between lipid and doxorubicin ﬂuorescence in the

heating TSLs results in continuous
drug delivery to tissue; dramatic
uptake by cells is seen far from
vessels, by 20 minutes. In addition,
drug is delivered without
extravasation by the liposomes

space), indicative of intravascular
release. The Dox-TSL  heat panel
illustrates that TSLs do not release
appreciable amounts of drug into

Intravascular Liposomal Release Promotes Drug Penetration

organs. Within 20 minutes, residual drug levels in tumor were
reduced to 9.6%  2.0% of the original peak intravascular drug
levels (Ivasc,max) in heated tumors and 13.7%  5.7% in nonheated tumors. In contrast, the high intravascular drug levels
maintained by the rapidly releasing liposomes allow for sustained drug accumulation in the extravascular space. At 20
minutes, drug is continuing to accumulate, with extravascular
levels at 160%  47% of the peak vascular drug level, 11- to 17fold higher than free drug.
The area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) for the
extravascular space provides a measure of the cumulative
exposure of tumor cells to drug (12, 13). Within the ﬁrst 20
minutes, AUC0–20 values of free drug with and without heat are
not statistically different, 156.8  41.7 and 185.2  160.8,
respectively (P value ¼ 0.6905). The AUC0–20 value for heated
nanoparticles was 9-fold higher than free drug þ heat, 1700 
863.1 (P value ¼ 0.0317). After 20 minutes of heating, the AUC
value for the Dox-TSL treatment group was still increasing due
to continual accumulation of drug, whereas AUC increases in
the free drug þ heat group with each additional minute are
minimal due to very low intravascular drug levels. This AUC0–20
value is only indicative of the ﬁrst 20 minutes of drug delivery
during a typical 1-hour heat treatment. Thus, these differences
would be magniﬁed for a 1-hour exposure. The ability to
maximize gains in AUC will be dependent on the local liposome
concentration in the blood supply, underscoring the importance of heating before liposome injection. Starting heat after
liposome injection would be expected to result in suboptimal
AUC, due to declining vascular levels of Dox-TSL caused by
clearance from the bloodstream (30). Maximum AUC could
also be affected by the circulation kinetics and stability of the
TSL formulation in plasma.

Over the time course of drug delivery, liposomes stay inside the
vasculature, indicating intravascular drug release. Liposome

interstitial space proves that drug accumulation in the interstitial space is due to release from liposomes still conﬁned in
the bloodstream. Intravascular release of doxorubicin and
subsequent redistribution into tumor tissue is further illustrated with B16 melanoma using the eNOS-GFPtg mouse
model (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Movie S2).
Enhanced tumor tissue uptake of drug
For each method of drug delivery, vascular clearance and
extravascular accumulation of drug were quantiﬁed with
image analysis (Fig. 4). Intravascular release results in longer
tumor cell exposure at higher drug concentrations as compared with free drug. Free drug administration, heat, results
in peak extravascular drug levels within 1 minute. Thereafter,
drug levels in the interstitial space decline as vascular concentration decreases. The drop in vascular concentration is a
reﬂection of elimination and distribution of drug to other

www.aacrjournals.org

Enhanced drug penetration
Doxorubicin's poor penetration characteristics have been
highlighted in vivo with mouse studies and in patients with
breast cancer (31, 32). To determine if intravascular release
resulted in enhanced drug penetration in addition to accumulation, we ﬁrst used image analysis to quantify relative drug
concentrations with distance away from blood vessels (Fig. 5).
Administration of free drug exhibits a characteristic decline in
drug concentration with distance from vessels; decreasing
intravascular concentrations quickly cause drug to diffuse back
toward the vasculature, resulting in relatively low drug retention
outside the microvessels. At distances of 35 mm from vessels (3–
4 cell layers), the maximum amount of drug delivered within
the ﬁrst few minutes was only 31%  7% of the peak intravascular drug level (Ivasc,max), and at 20 minutes after injection,
the amount of drug remaining at this distance declined to
10%  2%. Drug penetration for free drug without heat was
similar, 28%  5% at maximum and 14%  4% at 20 minutes.
Drug delivered with heat-triggered liposomes was continuous throughout the period of heating, resulting in increased
levels of drug out to 35 mm. This penetration was the furthest
possible depth measureable in the window chambers, given the
heterogeneity of vessels across all groups and tumor regions. In
contrast to the 10% residual drug at 35 mm from vessels after 20
minutes with free drug, Dox-TSL drug levels at this same

conﬁned to the vascular space although the signal intensity is reduced, indicating a loss of liposomes from the blood stream. E, 1 minute after the
onset of heat treatment at 41 C, the intravascular drug signal increases due to intravascular release of doxorubicin and dequenching effects as the drug leaves

distance were 138%  45% of Ivasc,max (P value ¼ 0.0087). In
addition, drug accumulation at the endothelial cell barrier
seemed to exhibit saturation kinetics; the drug level present at
the endothelial cell edge did increase, but to a lesser extent
than at further distances from microvessels. Drug accumulation at the endothelial cell edge changed from 88%  12% of
Ivasc,max at time 0 to 126%  32% of Ivasc,max at 20 minutes.
However, at distances 10 mm from the vasculature, the increase
was more dramatic, from 41%  16% at time 0 to 180%  46% at
20 minutes. Thus, the sustained intravascular release of drug
may aid in saturating endothelial and tumor cell drug transport
mechanisms, providing a method to enhance perivascular
penetration. Maintaining high intravascular drug levels led to
extravascular drug concentrations that exceeded maximal
plasma levels. This is most likely due to cellular uptake of the
drug, which removes drug from the interstitial space, thus
maintaining the concentration gradient. Indeed, nuclear accumulation of drug is readily seen in the confocal images and is
consistent with our prior observation of increased DNA-bound
drug for the Dox-TSL formulation, compared with free drug or
nonthermally sensitive liposomes (15). This ability to locally
deliver drug concentrations that exceed vascular concentrations cannot be achieved with free drugs or nonthermally
sensitive pegylated liposomes, where the extravasation is
dependent entirely upon pharmacodynamics and/or the EPR
effect, respectively (8, 33, 34).
To further deﬁne the enhanced drug penetration from DoxTSL, we conducted histologic analysis of ﬂank FaDu tumors on
mice that were given Dox-TSL þ heat, free drug  heat, or Doxil
þ heat. Tumors were harvested 30 minutes after heating for all
treatment groups except the Doxil þ heat group, which was
harvested 24 hours posttreatment to directly compare the Dox-

TSL penetration distance with the maximum nanoparticle
accumulation typically seen with the EPR effect (8, 33, 34).
Tissue sections were imaged for the vascular marker CD31 and
doxorubicin, and then analyzed using custom Matlab code to
determine the median penetration distance of drug from
vessels over the entire tumor section. With free drug, median
drug penetration was 29  10 and 55  6 mm, without and with
heat, respectively (Fig. 6), which is comparable with published
reports for this drug (32). However, the concentration delivered
at all distances with free drug was much lower than with either
Dox-TSL or Doxil, with maximum ﬂuorescence of free drug
being 16% to 25% of the maximum ﬂuorescence closest to
vessels with Dox-TSL. A direct comparison was also made
between TSL þ heat and the traditional liposome Doxil þ heat.
Dox-TSL þ heat resulted in a penetration distance double that
achievable with Doxil þ heat; drug penetrated 78  18 mm
compared with 34  9 mm, respectively (P value ¼ 0.0106). In
addition, at the point where drug levels from Dox-TSL þ heat
started to decrease below the level immediately proximal to the
vasculature, drug levels had already declined to 36% of their
initial value for the Doxil þ heat group. Thus, the confocal and
histology data together show that liposome-mediated intravascular drug release not only exposes tumor cells to a higher
drug concentration for a longer time period but also improves
tumor exposure to drug at every distance from vessels. Most
importantly, the overall achievable drug penetration is doubled
with intravascular release as compared with free drug or the
EPR effect seen with Doxil þ heat.

10% of the initial injected amount (9.6%  2.0% heated, 13.7%  5.7% nonheated). In contrast, doxorubicin levels continue to increase when delivered with
Dox-TSL þ heat. At 20 minutes into treatment, drug is still accumulating, with extravascular levels at 160%  47% of the initial injected drug amount.
Without heat, the nanoparticles shield drug from tissue, and doxorubicin accumulation levels are minimal (5.4%  1.9%), maintaining the toxicity beneﬁts of

molecularly targeted cancer therapies more speciﬁcally interfere with cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, and have the
potential to be more effective and less harmful to normal cells.
Yet, the challenge for these molecular therapeutic agents is still
fundamentally the same–-limited delivery. Lack of drug penetration or sufﬁcient concentration to result in tumor toxicity
has been highlighted using multiple small-molecule chemotherapeutics (32, 35–37), and the newer ﬂeet of monoclonal
antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors would be expected to
display these same penetration-limited pharmacodynamics
(12, 36). The larger the size of the drug, the more tumor
penetration becomes a fundamental limitation. Lack of drug
penetration becomes even more signiﬁcant when using nanoparticles, as their perivascular accumulation and slow release
pose a severe hindrance to drug delivery. The results here show
that even with hyperthermia, the maximum penetration of
Doxil is limited to 34 mm; other studies not using hyperthermia
have reported even more limited penetration of 8 to 16 mm (10).
Treatment with TSL þ heat to local tumors can be
thought of as the fusion of 2 traditional approaches to drug
delivery: (i) continuous infusion of drug and (ii) nanoparticle

www.aacrjournals.org

encapsulation. Drug infusions maintain elevated drug levels
in the bloodstream, and thus prevent drug washout from the
tumor before cellular uptake (13). However, this approach
does not provide any tumor selectivity. Alternatively, nanoparticles are typically designed to shield drug from normal
tissue, but this strategy sacriﬁces drug bioavailability. Our
results present the union of these 2 ideas—using a liposome
to shield the normal tissue from toxicity and incorporating
local release in the tumor vascular supply, effectively serving
as a continuous infusion that originates at the tumor site.
While this idea was previously postulated for TSL (24, 25, 38),
these results are the ﬁrst in vivo evidence to prove that
intravascular release is the predominant method of drug
delivery. Furthermore, these results show that this approach
exposes tumor cells to drug over a longer time frame,
delivers drug at a higher concentration at all distances from
blood vessels, and doubles the maximum penetration distance of drug into tumor tissue. It is also important to note

Figure 5. Drug penetration into tumor tissue from vessels through time. Doxorubicin penetration into the extravascular space is displayed as a percentage of
the peak intravascular ﬂuorescence (%Ivasc,max) through time. A and B, differences in drug accumulation with both time and penetration distance.
C and D, further display this data at speciﬁed time points. Time 0 minute corresponds to the time of peak intravascular concentration, with the 0 distance
deﬁned as the space immediately adjacent to the vascular compartment. A and C, free doxorubicin administration þ heat (n ¼ 5). Free drug exhibits
characteristic exponential decline in drug levels with vasculature, but within minutes most of the drug is reabsorbed into the bloodstream. B and D, doxorubicin
compartmentalization after Dox-TSL injection into a heated tumor (n ¼ 6). In contrast with free drug injection, doxorubicin delivered with Dox-TSL results
in an alteration of penetration characteristics, with continual buildup of drug into the interstitial space. Data are expressed as means and SD.

that the percentage of DNA-bound doxorubicin with DoxTSL is substantially greater than what can be achieved with a
Doxil-type of liposome formulation (15). The Doxil formulation is not thermally sensitive; we have shown that Doxil
does not exhibit enhanced drug release in the mild hyperthermia temperature range (41 C–45 C; ref. 16). Thus, we
would not expect signiﬁcant nuclear uptake of doxorubicin
during heating with Doxil. This recapitulates the concept
that Dox-TSL intravascular drug release/delivery provides a
venue for bioavailable drug delivery, as compared with Doxil,
where the drug remains entrapped inside the liposome after
delivery, where subsequent release occurs over days to
weeks.
Since the formulation and efﬁcacy publications for Dox-TSL
in 2000 (15, 16), several studies have been published, including
additional preclinical studies (21, 22), a canine clinical trial
(39), and pharmacokinetic data from a human clinical trial (30).
A comprehensive review of these studies was recently published (40).
Dox-TSL has also been tested in 3 phase I clinical trials.
Results of a phase I trial for patients with primary and
metastatic tumors of the liver treated with the combination
of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and Dox-TSL have been
reported (41). This dose escalation study involved a 30-minute

5572

infusion of Dox-TSL given 15 minutes before RFA. A statistically signiﬁcant difference in the time to treatment failure was
observed between the patients receiving at least the maximumtolerated dose (MTD) and patients receiving less than the MTD
(374 vs. 80 days, respectively). The authors concluded that the
combination of RFA and Dox-TSL was safe and likely more
efﬁcacious than RFA alone. These results formed the rationale
for a multinational phase III trial for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (NCT00617981; ref. 42). Accrual was recently
completed and follow-up is in progress. A report of this trial is
expected within the next year.
A phase I trial has been completed and a phase II trial has
been initiated for the treatment of recurrent chest wall disease
in breast cancer patients with the combination of Dox-TSL
and hyperthermia (NCT00826085; ref. 43). A prior phase I study
was conducted at Duke University, and a article combining
these 2 studies is being prepared for submission. Because of
the broad range of doxorubicin antitumor efﬁcacy, Dox-TSL
has the potential to be used to treat multiple other cancer
types.
Further research into intravascular release methods will be
dependent on the ability to localize the intended stimulus, in
this instance, application of hyperthermia to the tumor.
Advances in the application of hyperthermia over the last

Intravascular Liposomal Release Promotes Drug Penetration

Figure 6. Histologic assessment of drug penetration from vessels in a ﬂank tumor model. A and B, histology images following free doxorubicin þ heat (A) and
Dox-TSL þ heat (B) treatments, with drug (red), vessels stained with CD31 (green), and EF5 hypoxia marker (yellow; whereas these images vary in
extent of hypoxia, there was no statistical difference in the extent of hypoxia across all tumors). C, expresses drug levels as median ﬂuorescence intensity at
distances out to 100 mm from the nearest blood vessel. Dox-TSL delivers more drug at all distances from vessels as compared with Doxil and free
doxorubicin  heat. At the distance Dox-TSL levels start to decrease, Doxil levels are less than half that of Dox-TSL and have already decreased to
approximately one-third of their maximal concentration close to blood vessels. D, maximum drug penetration from tumor vasculature versus treatment
group and shows that drug delivered with Dox-TSL penetrates twice as far as with traditional Doxil liposomes (78 vs. 34 mm;  , P value ¼ 0.0106). Data are
expressed as medians (C) and means (D) with SD.

decade have already made this a clinical reality for localized
tumors (44–46). This article presents the idea of fast-triggered
release, which may not necessarily be limited to stimulus by
hyperthermia, however. With further advances in nanoparticle
technology, this same mechanism may equally be achieved
using other trigger stimuli, including ultrasound, light, radiation, or potentially even magnetic ﬁelds. Furthermore, the
ability to deliver drug to tumor at vascular penetration distances twice as far as previously achievable may result in
increased beneﬁt from microenvironmentally targeted drugs,
such as hypoxic cytotoxins, which have shown dramatic in vitro
results but often fail to deliver the same results in vivo due to
lack of penetration into hypoxic areas (47, 48).
Drug penetration distances are important clinically; for
example median intercapillary distances in cervix cancer
have been reported to be 167 mm (49). These distances were
also shown to be prognostically important, likely in relation
to drug delivery or hypoxia. Thus, data from this work
suggest that TSLs can deliver drug to most tumor cells in
such patients, considering that the 78-mm drug-diffusion
distance is on both sides of the capillary bed. This not only
provides an argument for further investigation into various
nanoparticle triggers but also allows some drugs to potentially be revisited if their efﬁcacy has in the past been limited
by drug diffusion.
