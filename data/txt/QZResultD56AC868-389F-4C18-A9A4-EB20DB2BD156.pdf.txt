BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to compare simultaneously obtained bone marrow (BM) cytogenetics (CTG), peripheral blood (PB) and BM fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) for BCR-ABL1 in monitoring response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and
homoharringtonine (HHT) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: PB and BM FISH (n ¼ 112 samples) and/or Q-PCR (n ¼ 132 samples) for BCR-ABL1 were simultaneously obtained in 70 patients with Philadelphia
chromosome-positive (Phþ) CML in chronic (68%), accelerated (16%), and blast phase (16%) before the initiation of
therapy and during the course of treatment with imatinib (IM) (n ¼ 40 patients), dasatinib (n ¼ 20 patients), nilotinib
(n ¼ 4 patients), bosutinib (n ¼ 18 patients), or HHT (n ¼ 4 patients) for patients with newly diagnosed (n ¼ 13
patients), IM-sensitive (n ¼ 34 patients), IM-resistant (n ¼ 30 patients), or IM-intolerant (n ¼ 9 patients) disease.
Eighteen patients were found to have Phþ variants or karyotypic abnormalities in addition to the Phþ. RESULTS:
Excellent correlations (r) were observed between PB and BM FISH (r ¼ 0.95) and PB and BM Q-PCR (r ¼ 0.87), as
well as BM CTG and PB FISH (r ¼ 0.89) and PB Q-PCR (r ¼ 0.82). This correlation was not affected by the presence
of the Phþ variant or additional chromosomal abnormalities, the presence of ABL1 kinase domain mutations, phase of
the disease, or treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PB FISH and Q-PCR appear to be reliable methods with which to monitor

Targeting BCR-ABL1 using the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate (IM) (Gleevec, Novartis,
East Hanover, NJ) dramatically improved outcomes in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1,2 Similar to what
was observed during treatment with interferon (IFN), the achievement of cytogenetic (CTG) remission is associated with
improved disease-free and overall survivals with IM therapy.1 Therefore, tracking Philadelphia chromosome positivity
(Phþ) yields valuable prognostic information. In addition, and with the availability of second- and third-generation
TKIs, early detection, while patients are receiving IM, of suboptimal responses, loss of response, or disease progression
permits treatment modifications that may favorably impact outcomes.3,4
Assessing the number of bone marrow (BM)-derived Phþ metaphases has been the gold standard for monitoring
response to therapy in CML. However, more sensitive methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), are not only more sensitive for detecting minimal residual disease, but are easily measurable on peripheral blood (PB) samples.5 Given the need for frequent monitoring in patients
with CML, interest in noninvasive methods has increased over the years. PB FISH correlated with BM CTG and BM

FISH during treatment with IFN, and excellent correlations have been reported between BM and PB PCR in
patients treated with IM.6-12 Correlations between PB
and BM assays to detect BCR-ABL1 during therapy with
second-line agents and beyond have not been reported to
the best of our knowledge, Therefore, we herein report
results in simultaneously obtained PB and BM FISH,
Q-PCR, and BM CTG in this setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
A computer database search retrospectively identified all
FISH and Q-PCR for BCR-ABL1 performed on PB and/
or BM samples between February 2004 and February
2009. Patients with Phþ acute lymphoblastic leukemia
were excluded. Phþ CML patients with simultaneous
(same day) PB and BM FISH and/or Q-PCR were
selected for this analysis. Demographics, disease characteristics, treatment, response, and outcomes were extracted
onto study-specific case report forms. This study was
approved by the Emory University Institutional Review
Board.
Staging and Response Criteria
Patients were classified according to World Health Organization criteria and assigned to the worst phase of the disease they ever reached. Phþ patients in chronic phase had
<10% PB and/or BM blasts and a platelet count 100
109/L; patients in accelerated phase had 10% to 19%
PB and/or BM blasts, thrombocytopenia (platelet count
<100 109/L) or thrombocytosis (platelet count >1000
109/L), and the presence of chromosomal abnormalities
in addition to the Phþ variant.13 Blast phase was defined
by the presence of >20% PB and/or BM blasts or the
presence of extramedullary disease. CTG responses were
complete if Phþ metaphases were 0%; partial if they were
between 1% and 34%, and minor if they were between
35% to 90%.14
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed
using the protocol provided by the manufacturer for the
dual fusion/dual color probe set of BCR-ABL1 (Abbott
Molecular, Inc, Des Plaines, Ill) on fixed cells from both
PB and/or BM. At least 2 technologists scored analyzable
interphase cells of each specimen, recording all patterns
observed, for a total of 200 nuclei. Results were considered clonal when the percentage of cells containing the

1246

BCR-ABL1 rearrangement exceeded the established, validated normal cutoff value of >1.0%.
Real-Time Quantitative PCR
Red cells were lysed by Ammonium chloride lysis and
white cells were stored in RNALater (Applied Biosystems/
Ambion, Austin, Tex) at a concentration of 5 million
cells/500 lL. RNA was extracted either using the Ambion
RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion)
(before September 15, 2008) or the Qiagen RNeasy Mini
Kit on the QIAcube (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) (after September 15, 2008). Reverse transcription and real-time
PCR were performed using the Light Cycler- t(9;22)
Quantification Kit and the Light Cycler 1.2 with Light*Cycler software (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Ind).
This kit detects products of b3a2 (e14a2), b3a3 (e14a3),
b2a2 (e13a2), b2a3 (e13a3), and e1a2 translocations; but
does not distinguish between different transcripts. Specific breakpoints were not determined in this study; however, the method used detects the common breakpoints
observed in CML (e13a2 and e14a2). Relative quantitation was performed using the delta Ct method. Results
were reported as a ratio of BCR-ABL1 to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and also as log-10 change
from a normalized baseline.
ABL1 Kinase Domain Mutation Analysis
Mutation analyses were performed by PCR and sequencing of the entire ABL1 kinase domain at independent
commercial laboratories (Genzyme Genetics [Westborough, Mass] and ARUP Laboratories [Salt Lake City,
Utah]).
Cytogenetic Analyses
BM mononuclear cells were cultured according to standard methods; 20 metaphase cells were analyzed for numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities by Gbanding with trypsin-Giemsa staining. Karyotype designation was performed using the International System for
Cytogenetic Nomenclature criteria.15 For the correlation
analyses, CTG findings were expressed as a percentage by
dividing the number of Phþ metaphases by the total
number of metaphases examined.
Statistical Analysis
The Pearson correlation statistic was used to analyze the
relation and generate the correlation coefficient between
pairs of continuous variables. One-way analysis of

Patient Characteristics
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. A total
of 70 patients who had throughout the course of their
treatment with 1 or 1 TKI and/or homoharringtonine
(HHT) simultaneous BM CTG, PB FISH, and BM
FISH (n ¼ 53 patients and 91 samples) or BM CTG, PB
Q-PCR, and BM Q-PCR (n ¼ 58 patients and 115 samples) were identified. Fifty-two patients had all 5 tests
(BM CTG, BM Q-PCR, BM FISH, PB FISH, and PB
Q-PCR) performed simultaneously at 84 various time
points. Patients in chronic phase (n ¼ 48 patients), accelerated phase (n ¼ 11 patients), or blast phase (n ¼ 11
patients) had, at any given time, newly diagnosed (n ¼ 13
patients), IM-sensitive (n ¼ 34 patients), IM-resistant (n

(SKI-606, Pfizer, New York, NY; n ¼ 18 patients), and/
or HHT (CGX-635, Chemgenex, Menlo Park, Calif;
n ¼ 4 patients). Samples were collected at diagnosis and
after the initiation of treatment. Approximately 68% of

Cancer

patients had samples collected at >1 time point, and 15
patients had samples collected during sequential treatments with different drugs. The median age of the
patients was 51 years (range, 18-79 years). Forty-nine
patients with IM-resistant CML were tested for the presence of ABL1 kinase domain mutations. Eighteen patients
had Phþ variant or chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the Phþ. Sixteen had a detectable mutation, and 5
had >1 mutation detected during the course of their
therapies.
FISH Analyses
Sixty-one patients had 112 FISH analyses performed
simultaneously on PB and BM samples. BM CTG results
were available in 54 of those patients. As shown in Figure
1, a very strong correlation (r) was found between PB
FISH and BM CTG (r ¼ 0.89; P < .0001) (Fig. 1a) and
PB FISH and BM FISH (r ¼ 0.95; P < .0001) (Fig. 1b),
as well as BM FISH and BM CTG (r ¼ 0.95; P < .0001)
(data not shown). When the analysis was restricted to
patients with detectable Phþ by BM CTG, the

PCR Analyses
Sixty-four patients had 132 Q-PCR analyses performed
simultaneously on PB and BM samples. BM CTG results
were available in 58 of those patients. As shown in Figure

CTG remission and with negative FISH had 37 detectable
BCR-ABL1 by Q-PCR on simultaneously obtained BM
and PB samples. The correlation between BM and PB
Q-PCR was very strong (r ¼ 0.96) (data not shown).

somal abnormalities to the Phþ variant;. Eighteen
patients had a Phþ variant (n ¼ 2) or additional chromosomal abnormalities (n ¼ 16). The Phþ variants
included: t(9;12) and t(9;19;22), and the chromosomal
abnormalities were der(9)t(9;22) (1 case), der(17)
(1 case), der(22)t(9;22) (1 case), þ8 (1 case), t(15;22) (1

correlation was also observed between BM and PB FISH
(r ¼ 0.95; P < .0001) (data not shown) and PB Q-PCR
and BM Q-PCR (r ¼ 0.95; P < .0001) (data not shown).
In addition, a very strong correlation was also observed
between BM FISH and BM CTG (r ¼ 0.93; P < .0001)
(data not shown) as well as BM Q-PCR and BM CTG (r

not affected by stage of CML or the type of TKI or HHT
(data not shown).
PB FISH and Q-PCR Values at the Time of
Complete BM CTG Remission
Patients in whom sequential quarterly monitoring was
available from the time of diagnosis or CTG recurrence to
complete CTG remission were selected. No patient had a
positive PB FISH and a complete CTG remission. Three
patients had a transient detectable BM Phþ (2 of 20, 3 of
20, and 1 of 40 Phþ metaphases/total metaphases analyzed, respectively) in the absence of a detectable BCRABL1 by PB FISH. After normalization of the Q-PCR
data using log-2 transformation, a median log-2 Q-PCR
( the standard deviation) was determined at the time of
various CTG responses. As expected and shown in Figure
4, the highest values were found in patients with newly
diagnosed CML, patients with CTG recurrences, and/or
patients with no CTG responses, and the lowest values
were noted in patients with complete CTG response
(P<.01). There was no overlap in the confidence intervals
between patients with no/partial CTG responses and
patients in complete CTG response.
Cost Analysis
A cost analysis was performed to compare standard monitoring using BM CTG with PB monitoring using FISH
and PCR. The costs for monitoring with BM biopsies was
calculated by including professional and technical fees, as
well as fees associated with conscious sedation. The costs
to monitor patients using PB FISH and Q-PCR were estimated by including professional and technical fees, as well
as fees associated with phlebotomies. Costs for standard
semi-annual monitoring using BM biopsies for CTG
analyses in the first 18 months after the diagnosis of CML
was US$11,104, whereas PB monitoring was US$2592
for a difference of US$8512.

to significant and durable responses.17-19 Monitoring for
the presence of the balanced translocation between chromosome 9 and 22 remains the gold standard in evaluating
CML response to treatment,20 because major reductions
in the numbers and the disappearance of Phþ metaphases
are associated with improved survival.1,21 In addition to
predicting outcomes, tracking BCR-ABL1 permits the
early detection of loss of CTG response, and a switch in
therapy to at least a second-line agent or allogeneic stem
cell transplantation. Early intervention may be relevant.
In a recent report, patients who were switched from IM to
dasatinib at the time of a loss of CTG response had better
outcomes compared with those switched during loss of
hematologic response.4 In addition, and given that CML
is a stem cell disease that will likely not be completely
eradicated with TKIs,22,23 long-term monitoring will
remain an essential tool in the management of these
patients. Therefore, reliable noninvasive and convenient
monitoring methods are desirable.
Reliability of PB FISH and/or Q-PCR to monitor
for the presence of BCR-ABL1 has previously been investigated and is summarized in Table 2.6-12 Strong correlations were observed between PB Q-PCR and BM
CTG7,9,10 or BM Q-PCR7,9-11 after transplantation, IFN
combinations, and IM. Strong correlations were also
reported between BM FISH and BM CTG and/or PB

Table 2. Summary of Studies Comparing PB and BM CTG, FISH and/or Q-PCR in CML

current study is the first report to describe correlations
between PB and BM Q-PCR, FISH, and BM CTG in simultaneous samples obtained from patients treated with 1
or more than 1 TKI and/or HHT. These correlations
were found to be strong and not affected by the stage of
the disease, the type of TKI, and the presence of additional chromosomal abnormalities, Phþ variants, or
ABL1 kinase domain mutations.
Can Achievement of Complete CTG Remission be Predicted Using PB FISH? In a recently reported GIMEMA
study in which BM FISH was simultaneously obtained
with BM CTG,25 BM FISH reliably predicted complete,
but not partial, CTG responses during treatment with
IM. In the current study, albeit in a smaller number of
patients, a very strong correlation was observed between
BM CTG and both BM and PB FISH in patients with detectable Phþ when monitored on a quarterly basis. In
addition and throughout treatment with different agents,
no false-positive PB FISH was found when complete BM
CTG remission was achieved, and only 5% of patients (3
of 56 patients) had transient low levels of detectable BM
Phþ in the absence of a detectable BCR-ABL1 as measured by PB FISH.
Limitations of the current study include the relatively small number of patients/samples, the retrospective
nature of the analysis, and the heterogeneous patient population that ranged from those with newly diagnosed
untreated CML to those receiving long-term treatment
with IM, and IM-resistant or IM-intolerant patients
receiving at least second-line agents. In addition, FISH
and Q-PCR are selective assays for the specific detection
of BCR-ABL1, and therefore are inadequate to detect
emerging clonal abnormalities that may develop in the absence of the Phþ. The significance of these clonal abnormalities occurring in Ph-negative metaphases remains
unclear.20,26-29 Clinical context can help tailor suspicions
and guide additional BM examinations. Indeed, these
cytogenetic abnormalities tend to be relatively rare
(3.4%), frequently transient, are observed in patients previously treated with IFN, are usually detected before
CTG remission occurs, and are often associated with lateonset cytopenias.26-28,30
Well-accepted recommendations for monitoring
patients with chronic phase CML receiving IM therapy
include BM CTG analyses at 3 months and 6 months,
then every 6 months for first 18 months or until complete
CTG response.14,30,31 Recommendations for the management of patients treated with dasatinib or nilotinib have
not been established. The results of the current study, if

independently confirmed, may reassure physicians and
help reduce the number of routine BM biopsies in
patients treated with at least second-line agents and to a
certain degree patients receiving IM. In IM-treated
patients, after a diagnostic BM has established the phase
of the disease, an optimal BM CTG response at 3 months
followed by a very low or negative PB FISH percentage at
6 months may spare those optimally responding patients
subsequent BM biopsies. These patients can be monitored
by PB FISH until FISH negativity, and subsequently by
PB Q-PCR to assess molecular response. Restaging BM
biopsies would be necessary at the time a rise in PB QPCR leads to FISH positivity. Given that interventions at
the time of rising levels of Q-PCR without loss of CTG
response remain unproven, and the excellent correlations
between PB Q-PCR, PB FISH, and BM CTG reported
herein, such approach is reasonable. As highlighted in the
recent European LeukemiaNet guidelines,31 BM biopsies
would still be required in at-risk patients who develop
new late-onset cytopenia while receiving IM regardless of
Q-PCR levels.21,26-30 This strategy could also be acceptable for patients with IM-resistant or IM-intolerant CML
receiving at least second-line agents, in whom definitions
for suboptimal responses are not as well established. This
proposed approach would also be financially cost effective
in the United States, as suggested by our cost analysis. The
approximate saving of US$8500 using PB analyses was
based on monitoring during the first 18 months after the
initiation of IM for newly diagnosed, chronic phase
CML.32 This difference in costs would be magnified,
should patients require more frequent monitoring during
or beyond the first 18 months of therapy, as is often the
case for patients with IM-resistant CML receiving at least
a second-generation TKI or HHT.
In conclusion, the data from the current study suggest
that PB FISH and Q-PCR are reliable methods with which
to monitor CTG response to modern therapy in all phases
of CML, and should cautiously be considered a positive
step in sparing CML patients ‘‘routine’’ BM biopsies.
