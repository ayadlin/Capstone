ABSTRACT
Renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer and
the 8th most common cancer overall in the US. RCC survival rates drop precipitously
with regional and distant spread and recent studies have demonstrated that RCC
presents an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype linked to increased
recurrence and decreased survival. EMT is a key characteristic of tumor stem cells
(TSCs) along with chemo-resistance and radio-resistance, which are also phenotypic
of RCC. Targeting these factors is key to increasing the survival of RCC patients.
Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) marks TSCs in pancreatic and colorectal cancer
and regulates EMT and stemness. Analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas’ RCC
dataset revealed that DCLK1 is overexpressed and dysregulated on the mRNA and
epigenetic level in more than 93% of RCC tumors relative to adjacent normal tissue.
Immunohistochemistry using α-DCLK1 antibody confirmed overexpression and
demonstrated a major increase in immunoreactivity in stage II-III tumors compared
to normal kidney and stage I tumors. Small-interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated
knockdown of DCLK1 resulted in decreased expression of EMT and pluripotency factors
and significantly reduced invasion, migration, focal adhesion, drug-resistance, and
clonogenic capacity. These findings suggest that DCLK1 is a novel, overexpressed
factor in RCC progression that may be targeted to suppress EMT, metastasis, and
stemness in early-stage and advanced RCC to increase patient survival. Moreover, the
possibility that DCLK1 may mark a population of tumor stem-like cells in RCC should
be further investigated in light of these findings.

for patients with localized disease, patients with regional
spread or metastatic disease have 64.2 and 12.3% 5-year
survival rates respectively [1].
RCC is a highly radio- and chemo-resistant
cancer characterized grossly by cell heterogeneity and
hypervascularity [3, 4]. On the molecular level RCC is
often associated with mutagenic or epigenetic inactivation
of the Von-Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL)
leading to altered expression of hypoxia-inducible and
angiogenic factors [5, 6]. More recently, RCC has been
shown to possess an epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT) phenotype and levels of EMT-related factors
E-cadherin, Twist1, Vimentin, and β-catenin have been
linked to adverse pathologies, increased recurrence, and
reduced survival [2, 7].
Resistance to therapy, cell heterogeneity, and an
EMT phenotype are key characteristics conferred by
tumor stem cells (TSCs). Moreover, hypoxic conditions
have been shown to support stemness in many cancers
[8]. The stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors as
a result of VHL inactivation or direct somatic mutation
in RCC may support an optimal environment for TSCdriven tumor progression. Doublecortin-like kinase 1
(DCLK1) is a tumor stem cell marker in colon cancer,
pancreatic cancer, and likely other cancers [9-13] that is
overexpressed in hypoxic conditions [13]. Lineage-tracing
experiments using Dclk1-driven Cre recombinase mouse
models demonstrate that the Dclk1+ tuft cell is a cell of
origin for adenomas and colon cancer following loss of
Apc in the intestine [9, 14]. Both the intestine and the
proximal tubules of the kidney possess a prominent brush
border, which aids in the process of nutrient reabsorption.
Moreover, RCC arises from the proximal tubules in
humans and can be initiated by loss of Apc in the renal
epithelium in mice [15]. Despite these similarities and
DCLK1’s emerging role as a TSC in gastrointestinal
cancers, it has not been assessed in cancers of the
excretory system. Here we demonstrate that DCLK1 is
a potential therapeutic target against invasion, migration,
focal adhesion, and stemness that is overexpressed in RCC
tumors.

[1, 16]. Approximately 1/3rd of the patients had been
reported deceased at the date linked to the dataset (Table
SI).

DCLK1 is overexpressed and has a unique
methylation signature in RCC
Analysis of the TCGA KIRC RNA-Seq dataset
[17] and multiple NCBI gene expression omnibus gene
microarray datasets [16, 18] revealed that DCLK1 is
massively overexpressed in RCC tumors compared to
adjacent normal tissue (Fig 1A; Fig S1A-C). Additionally,
the expression levels of DCLK1 were similar regardless of
disease stage (Fig 1B). In patients with distant metastases
DCLK1 was overexpressed approximately 1.3-fold
(p=0.01, Fig 1C). Of the 72 patients in the KIRC RNASeq dataset with adjacent matched normal tissue only 5
patient tumors did not overexpress DCLK1 (Fig 1D). In
order to assess whether DCLK1 mRNA expression may
serve as a biomarker in RCC, we performed a receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using
Graphpad Prism 6.0. We found that DCLK1 mRNA
expression is an excellent biomarker for RCC (p<0.0001,
AUC = 0.876±0.019; Fig 1E).
Genes are often dysregulated in cancer as a
result of epigenetic alterations, and global changes
in tumor methylation are common [19]. Recently,
DCLK1 methylation has been reported as a biomarker
in cholangiocarcinoma and colon cancer [20, 21]. From
159 KIRC patients we compared tumor and matched
normal samples that had been subjected to Illumina
450k Methylation Array analysis. We selected probes
for analysis that demonstrated a p-value <0.001 between
matched tissues by the Student’s tTest. Using these probes
we performed single-linkage hierarchical clustering and
found that DCLK1 has a unique methylation signature
in RCC tumor tissue (Fig 2A). DCLK1 has multiple
promoters that produce multiple coding and non-coding
transcripts (Fig 2B). A recent report focusing on a
particular region of the DCLK1 α-promoter demonstrated
hypermethylation in cholangiocarcinoma suggesting gene
knockdown and a potential tumor suppressor function
for DCLK1 in that cancer [20]. We found that although
part of this region was hypermethylated in RCC, when
the promoter as a whole is taken into consideration strong
hypomethylation is present. Moreover, we found that the
β-promoter was also hypomethylated (Figure 2C). ROC
curve construction and analysis revealed that DCLK1
promoter methylation can serve as a biomarker in RCC
(p<0.0001, AUC = 0.758±0.028; Fig 1E). To determine
which promoter’s methylation was a better biomarker we
constructed separate ROC curves for each promoter and

Patient Characteristics of the KIRC Dataset
The Cancer Genome Atlas’ (TCGA) KIRC dataset
was used to analyze patient mRNA, methylation, and
protein levels. The average and median ages of patients
upon diagnosis were slightly higher for females compared
to males. There were almost twice as many males as
females in the study, and the vast majority of the patients
were white (>91%). Rates of distant metastasis for this

methylation of probe cg13805761, which is associated
with an intronic region with high Histone 3 Lysine 27
activity at Chr13:36553414 according to ENCODE
[23], and DCLK1 mRNA expression as reported in
the Broad Institute’s standard data analyses [24]. Our
analysis confirmed this relationship (Pearson R = -0.2498,
p<0.0001; Fig 2E).
To assess DCLK1 protein expression in RCC
we performed immunohistochemistry using α-DCLK1
antibody on a commercially available tissue microarray.
A chi-square test was performed to examine the relation
between DCLK1 immunostaining and RCC diagnosis.
The relation between these variables was significant,
X2 (1, n = 192) = 4.156, p <0.05, indicating that RCC
tumors were significantly more likely to demonstrate
DCLK1 immunostaining. Mean tumor expression of
DCLK1 protein was 2 fold higher in tumors compared to

normal samples and tumor samples
and the
average AUC [22]. Using this method we found that
β-promoter methylation (AUC = 0.838±0.024) was a
significantly better biomarker than α-promoter methylation
(AUC = 0.629±0.032) with z = -5.345 where z above 2 or
below -2 is considered to be statistically significant.
Next we assessed isoform specific RNA-Seq data
from these same patients and found that isoform 1, which
is produced from the α-promoter, and isoform 4, which
is produced from the β-promoter, are both significantly
overexpressed (Figure 2D). CAMK-related peptide
(CARP/ANIA4), another product of the β-promoter
also demonstrated increased expression, but was not
statistically significant (data not shown). Isoform 3 was
not expressed in either normal or tumor tissue in the
kidney, save for a few samples at low levels (data not

normal kidney (data not shown). Moreover, stage II and
III tumors demonstrated significantly increased DCLK1
protein expression compared to both normal kidney
and stage I tumors (Figure 3A-B), and DCLK1 protein
expression was also upregulated in grade I and II tumors
(Figure 3C). Together, these data demonstrate that DCLK1
is epigenetically altered and significantly overexpressed
in RCC, and dysregulation of DCLK1 methylation
and mRNA expression are interrelated. Moreover,
immunohistochemical staining confirms these findings
for DCLK1 protein in patient tumors and demonstrates

which lead to an invasive phenotype characterized by
low expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin (CDH1)
and high expression of mesenchymal markers Vimentin
(VIM) and N-cadherin (CDH2). We found that the VIM
and CDH2 were overexpressed while CDH1 mRNA was
significantly downregulated in RCC tumors compared
to matched normal adjacent tissue (p<0.0001, Fig S2A).
In stage-wise comparisons we determined that VIM was
significantly increased in Stage III and IV compared to
Stage I tumor tissue (p<0.05, Fig S1D). No stage-wise
effects were seen for CDH1 or CDH2 (data not shown).
Interestingly, three of the five patients that displayed
lower expression of DCLK1 mRNA in tumors compared
to normal adjacent tissue were among the few patients that
displayed high expression of CDH1.
VIM gene expression and loss of E-cadherin are
prognostic markers for cancer-specific survival in renal
cell carcinomas [25, 26]. In order to assess overall survival
in the KIRC dataset relative to VIM gene expression and

and bottom 25th percentiles respectively for analysis.
High VIM expression was a prognostic factor for poor
overall survival as determined by the Log-Rank test
(p=0.035) with a median survival difference of 813 days.
However, the Wilcoxon test which is sensitive to survival
differences at earlier time points did not indicate statistical
significance, suggesting that the reduction in overall
survival is not likely attributable to the modest stagedependent increases in VIM expression (Fig S1D). Low
CDH1 gene and protein expression were both prognostic
factors for poor overall survival as determined by the LogRank test (p<0.005) as well as the Wilcoxon test (p<0.002,
Fig S2B). Using RNA-Seq data the median survival
difference between groups was 248 days, while for
protein it was 761 days. These data link RCC to an EMT
phenotype, confirm the previously reported use of these
markers as prognostic indicators, and support targeting
factors that modulate EMT as a therapeutic strategy to
increase RCC survival.

In order to assess the therapeutic potential of
silencing DCLK1 in RCC we transfected Caki-2 cells with
25 nM DCLK1 siRNA (siDCLK1) targeting the primary
DCLK1 protein-encoding transcripts (Fig S3A) or 25 nM
siRNA of a scrambled sequence targeting no known genes
(siSCR) as a control for 48 or 72 h. Following treatment
50-60% knockdown of DCLK1 was confirmed by realtime RT-PCR and Western blot (Fig 4A-B). Additionally,
siDCLK1 treatment decreased cell proliferation by
approximately 20% following 48 h transfection (Fig S3B).
DCLK1 has been shown to regulate the expression
of EMT factors in multiple gastrointestinal cancer models
[27-30]. Similarly, the expression of EMT transcription
factors SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1, and ZEB1 was
significantly decreased 48 h post siDCLK1 transfection
(Fig 4C). While mesenchymal marker Vimentin protein

expression was decreased 40-50% 72 h post transfection
(Fig 4B). Based on the loss of EMT marker expression
following siDCLK1 treatment, we assessed the functional
effect of DCLK1 knockdown on RCC cell migration
and invasion in vitro. There was an approximately 30%
decrease in wound-healing capacity in Caki-2 cells
treated with 25 nM of siDCLK1 compared to 25 nM
siSCR controls at 12, 24, and 48 h post-wound formation
(p<0.0003 for all points; Fig 4F). DCLK1 knockdown has
previously been shown to reduce the invasive capabilities
of pancreatic cancer cells [12]. 48 h post transfection
Caki-2 invasion was reduced 80-90% in 25 nM siDCLK1
treated cells compared to 25 nM siSCR treated cells
(p<0.02; Fig 4D-E). These results demonstrate that
DCLK1 knockdown reduces the invasive and metastatic
capabilities of RCC.

During our studies it became apparent that
cells transfected with siDCLK1 for 48 h appeared to
demonstrate a uniform increase in the space between
cells compared to siSCR treated cells. To quantify the
observed increase in intercellular space, image-processing
techniques were used to compare the unoccupied
intercellular area between treatment groups (Fig 5A)
and demonstrated a statistically significant increase
in unoccupied area between both 12.5 nM and 25 nM
siDCLK1 treated cells compared to 25 nM siSCR treated
cells (p<0.011; Fig 5B). To rule out changes in cell cycle
dynamics induced by siDCLK1 as a source of the aberrant
adhesion we performed cell cycle analysis of 48 h siSCR
and siDCLK1 treated Caki-2 cells. No notable changes

in cell cycle were observed between the controls and
treated cells (Fig S3C). Moreover, a significant decrease
in PTK2 (FAK) protein expression, a key regulator of
focal adhesion which network analysis suggests may be
regulated through DCLK1’s physical association with
calmodulin [31-33], was found 72 h post-transfection (Fig
5D; Fig S3D).
To confirm the decreased adhesive phenotype
following siDCLK1 transfection, immunocytochemistry
was performed using TRITC-phalloidin, which detects
filamentous actin (F-actin), and vinculin antibody, which
detects the specific sites of focal adhesions. A loss of rigid
F-actin strands as well as a modestly decreased number of
focal adhesions was observed in cells transfected with 25
nM siDCLK1 (Fig 5C). These results demonstrate a new
functional role for DCLK1 in maintaining focal adhesion
in cancer and another potential mechanism of action for
siDCLK1’s anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects.

As we have seen in other cancers and cancer cell
lines [12], knockdown of DCLK1 reduced the expression
of stem cell pluripotency factors MYC, NANOG,
POU5F1/OCT4, and SOX2 in Caki-2 cells (Fig 6A).
Moreover, the expression of ALDH1A1 (Fig 6B), a
putative RCC stem cell marker that is associated with
decreased recurrence-free and overall survival [34, 35],
was significantly decreased 72 h post transfection. These
findings demonstrate that DCLK1 regulates the expression
of stemness and pluripotency related factors in RCC.
To investigate the alteration of stemness further,
a clonogenic assay was performed with Caki-2 cells
transfected with siDCLK1 or siSCR. Following 2 weeks
of growth there was an approximately 25 and 30%
decrease in the number of colonies formed from 12.5 nM
and 25 nM siDCLK1 treated cells respectively relative

stark, approximately 70% decrease in the mean size of
12.5 and 25 nM siDCLK1 transfected colonies suggesting
that DCLK1 is an important factor in RCC anchorageindependent growth (Fig 6C-E). These results as a
whole demonstrate that DCLK1 is directly or indirectly
responsible for maintaining functional stemness in RCC
cells and suggest that disruption or inhibition of DCLK1
should be investigated as both a primary and adjuvant
therapy in RCC.

lifespan, and there is a desperate need to identify
novel therapeutic targets that can slow or prevent this
spread in order to improve the survival of patients with
advanced disease. Moreover, RCC’s survival-related
EMT phenotype, hypoxic conditions, slow growth rate,
and intense radio/chemo-resistance suggest that it may
represent a model tumor stem cell driven cancer.
In this study we leveraged data generated by TCGA
to demonstrate that DCLK1 is epigenetically dysregulated
and overexpressed in RCC compared to normal tissue
and confirmed these findings at the protein level by
immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that DCLK1 methylation and mRNA expression can serve
as RCC tissue biomarkers, and confirmed a relationship
between DCLK1 methylation and mRNA expression.
Analysis of the TCGA methylation data for DCLK1
exemplifies the complex epigenetic alterations present in
cancerous tissue and suggests the need to take a careful

approach to analyzing these alterations in genes with
multiple protein coding transcripts such as DCLK1.
However, we are confident that with an understanding of
these complex sets of alterations – highly specific DCLK1
methylation biomarkers can be identified.
One of the most novel findings of this study is that
DCLK1 knockdown leads to a significant loss of cell
adhesion, which may be integral to the anti-migratory
and anti-invasive effects observed. It is well known that
DCLK1 colocalizes with both microtubules and the actin
cytoskeleton, but these associations and their significance
in cancer have not been investigated in depth. Moreover,
the observed loss of adhesion is also interesting in light of
DCLK1’s roles in neurite formation and elongation [37]
and should be investigated further in other cancers known
to express DCLK1.
Given the importance of hypoxia and hypoxiainducible factors in RCC we subjected Caki-2 cells to
hypoxia to assess DCLK1 expression. Following 2 h of
hypoxia we found that DCLK1 mRNA expression was
massively increased along with pluripotency factors
MYC, POU5F1/OCT4, and SOX2 (Fig 7A). Additionally,
we found that DCLK1 protein expression was highly

increased following 7 h of hypoxia (Fig 7B). These
findings merit further study into DCLK1’s role in the
hypoxic RCC tumor environment. In previous studies
we have demonstrated that DCLK1 regulates angiogenic
factors, which are tightly regulated by hypoxia inducible
factors [38]. Further studies will be needed to assess
whether inhibition or downregulation of DCLK1 is
sufficient to reduce hypoxia inducible factor signaling,
angiogenesis, and stemness in RCC under hypoxia.
Although a previous report using northern blotting
indicated that DCLK1 was not expressed in the normal
human kidney [39], we observed positive staining in renal
tubules, stroma, and endothelia in normal sections present
on the tissue microarray (Fig 7C). To our knowledge
this will be the first reported data demonstrating DCLK1
expression in the normal kidney. Larger tissue sections
from whole normal kidney will be needed for detailed
characterization of DCLK1’s expression in this organ.
However, we believe that this data in addition to the
functional similarities between renal tubules and the
small intestinal epithelium merits further investigation of
DCLK1 in kidney diseases in addition to cancer.
Finally, we note that different therapeutic

interventions targeting DCLK1 in cancer are currently
under development. Since EMT is a major factor in
the survival of RCC patients and DCLK1 regulates
this process, some of these interventions may have the
potential to significantly extend survival. Notably, a
number of DCLK1 targeting agents have been developed
in the kinase inhibitor class of drugs [29, 30] – a class
that has proven effective in extending the lives of patients
with advanced RCC. Moreover, our preliminary studies
indicate that DCLK1 knockdown sensitizes RCC cells
to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib (Fig S3E),
which may be beneficial in early treatment or extend
sunitinib’s efficacy after resistance has developed. This
effect is likely related to the loss of stemness following
DCLK1 knockdown. In addition, DCLK1 is overexpressed
in a majority of patient tumors and has a targetable cellsurface domain. These characteristics suggest that it may
be an optimal beacon for promising, targeted anticancer
drugs such as monoclonal antibodies or antibody-drug
conjugates. Further studies in animal models of RCC as
well as patient derived xenograft and orthotopic models
will be needed to determine the efficacy of these DCLK1targeted therapeutics.

Caki-2 human clear cell renal carcinoma cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and maintained in RPMI medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For siRNA-mediated
knockdown studies, 105 Caki-2 cells were seeded into 6
cm petri dishes and allowed to attach overnight. Following
attachment, 25 nM of commercially validated siRNA
targeting human DCLK1 exons 4/8 of the β/α-promoter
isoforms respectively (siDCLK1; Life Technologies
s17584) or 25 nM human scrambled sequence (siSCR)
not targeting any known genes were complexed with
Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) and added to the
dishes in fresh cell culture medium. After 48 and 72 h of
treatment respectively, RNA and protein were collected
for analysis.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from Caki-2 cells using Tri
Reagent (MRC) per the manufacturer’s instructions. First
strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using SuperScript
II Reverse Transcriptase and random hexanucleotide
primers (Invitrogen). The complementary DNA was
subsequently used to perform RT-PCR on an iCycler IQ5
Thermal Cycler (BioRad) using SYBR Green (Molecular
Probes) with gene-specific primers and JumpStart™ Taq
DNA polymerase (Sigma). The crossing threshold value
assessed was normalized to β-actin and quantitative
changes in mRNA were expressed as fold-change relative
to control ± SEM value. The Student’s t-test was used to
determine statistical significance. The primer sequences
for the genes analyzed are provided in Table SII.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analysis of NCBI GEO and TCGA patient data
The standard data run for 11/14/2013 of The
Cancer Genome Atlas’ (TCGA) Kidney Renal Clear Cell
Carcinoma (KIRC) dataset was downloaded from the
Broad Institute’s Genome Data Analysis Center using
the firehose_get tool. Data was sorted and manipulated
for analysis using the R statistical environment (version
3.0.2). NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data was
downloaded directly.

Western blotting
Denatured proteins of cell lysates were subjected to
Western blot analysis. The concentration of total proteins
was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford,
IL). 40 μg of total proteins was separated on a 7.5%–15%
SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a PVDF
membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% non-fat dry
milk for 1 h and probed overnight with primary antibody.
Subsequently the membrane was incubated with infrared
cw800-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature. The proteins were detected using a LICOR
Odyssey Infrared Imager. Protein density quantification
was performed in Image Studio Lite (LICOR).

Pathological characterization of RCC tissue
A kidney cancer tissue microarray (US Biomax
KD2085) containing 192 microsections including 20
normal kidney samples and 64 stage I, 76 stage II, 30
stage III, and 2 stage IV RCC samples was stained with
hematoxylin and eosin and immunostained with α-DCLK1
antibody (ab31704) following a previously described
immunohistochemistry protocol [29]. Each stained
tissue micro-section was scored independently by two
pathologists and based on percent of tissue demonstrating
staining (1 for <10% - 4 for > 60%) and staining intensity
(1 for lowest intensity - 4 for highest intensity). The
resulting scores were multiplied by each other to obtain a
composite score.

Proliferation Assays
For analysis of siDCLK1’s effect on proliferation
105 Caki-2 cells/well were seeded into 2 six well plates.
2202

Oncotarget

Each plate was transfected with 25nM siDCLK1 or
siSCR respectively for 48 h after which resazurin (alamar
blue; Biotium) was added to each well according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. After 2 h the fluorescence was
read at 590 nm. For calculations, values were normalized
to siSCR.

remaining cells were fixed with 100% methanol, stained
with 0.1% crystal violet, and allowed to dry. After drying
all invading cells were counted from each transwell at
4x magnification. Cell number was normalized to siSCR
control x 100 and results were reported as invasion
(%siSCR Control).

Wound healing assay

Colony formation assay

105 Caki-2 cells/well were seeded into 6-well plates,
allowed to grow to 50% confluence, and transfected with
25 nM siDCLK1 or 25 nM siSCR for 48 h. Following
a 24 h recovery period, a sterile 200 μl pipette tip was
used to scratch the confluent layer, and detached cells
were removed with washing. For each plate 9 points
were selected and marked and baseline images were
taken at 4x magnification. Images were again taken at
12, 24, and 48h. Images were converted to 16-bit format,
thresholded, and the migrating edges were detected using
the analyze particles function in ImageJ. All replicates
were normalized to their baseline value and migration was
reported as relative wound area remaining.

Caki-2 cells were seeded into a 6 cm dish and
transfected with 25 nM siSCR, 12.5 nM siDCLK1, or 25
nM siDCLK1 using Lipofectamine 3000 as a transfection
reagent. Following 48 h transfection, 5000 Caki-2 cells/
well (4 replicates per siRNA treatment) were seeded into
0.3% soft agar on top of a 0.6% soft agar base in a 24 well
plate. 250 ul of complete medium was added on top of
each well and replenished every 3rd day. The cells were
allowed to form colonies for 14 days and on day 14 the
plates were stained with 0.5% crystal violet. A 4X image
was taken of each well and analysis was performed by
using a macro to automatically convert images to 16-bit,
threshold, and run the analyze particles function to count
the number of cells and measure the area of each. The
collected data were normalized to siSCR and reported as
relative percent change.

Analysis of Focal Adhesion
Level of focal adhesion was qualitatively assessed
by immunocytochemistry using an actin cytoskeleton/
focal adhesion staining kit (Millipore) containing TRITCconjugated phalloidin and mouse α-Vincullin according
to the manufacturer instructions. To increase clarity cell
nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. In order to
quantitatively assess cell adhesion images of siDCLK1 or
siSCR transfected cells (48 h transfection + 24 h recovery)
were taken at 4X at 1280 x 960 resolution where 1 pixel
is equivalent to 1 μM. The images were converted to 16bit, thresholded, and assessed with the analyze particles
function in ImageJ. The sum of the area of all particles
(cells) combined was subtracted from the total image area
to give the area of unoccupied intercellular space. These
experiments were carried out twice independently to
ensure precision.

Induction of Hypoxia in RCC Cells
105 Caki-2 cell/well were seeded into a 6-well plate
and allowed to attach overnight. Following attachment
cells were incubated either under normoxia or hypoxia
(1% O2/5% CO2). Cells were lysed at various time
intervals and subjected to mRNA or protein expression
analysis as described.

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in Graphpad
Prism 6.0, SPSS Statistics 22, and Microsoft Excel. For
non-parametric data the Mann-Whitney U test was used,
and for parametric data the Student’s tTest was used. For
survival analyses the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and the
Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test were used. A p-value of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for
all analyses.

Matrigel transwell invasion assay
Matrigel coated transwells (BD Biosciences) were
prepared by soaking in serum-free media for 2 h at 37ºC
in a 24-well plate. Subsequently, Caki-2 cells (5000/well)
pre-transfected with either 25 nM siDCLK1 or siSCR for
48 h were seeded into each transwell in serum-free media
in triplicate. Cell culture medium containing 10% FBS
was added to the bottom of each well as chemoattractant
and the cells were incubated for 22h at 37°C under 5%
CO2. Afterwards, a cotton swab was used to scrape noninvasive/migratory cells off the top of transwells and the
