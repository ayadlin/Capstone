ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer (PCA) kills thousands of men every year, demanding additional
approaches to better understand and target this malignancy. Recently, critical
role of aberrant lipogenesis is highlighted in prostate carcinogenesis, offering
a unique opportunity to target it to reduce PCA. Here, we evaluated efficacy and
associated mechanisms of silibinin in inhibiting lipid metabolism in PCA cells. At
physiologically achievable levels in human, silibinin strongly reduced lipid and
cholesterol accumulation specifically in human PCA cells but not in non-neoplastic
prostate epithelial PWR-1E cells. Silibinin also decreased nuclear protein levels
of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and 2 (SREBP1/2) and their target
genes only in PCA cells. Mechanistically, silibinin activated AMPK, thereby increasing
SREBP1 phosphorylation and inhibiting its nuclear translocation; AMPK inhibition
reversed silibinin-mediated decrease in nuclear SREBP1 and lipid accumulation.
Additionally, specific SREBP inhibitor fatostatin and stable overexpression of SREBP1
further confirmed the central role of SREBP1 in silibinin-mediated inhibition of PCA
cell proliferation and lipid accumulation and cell cycle arrest. Importantly, silibinin
also inhibited synthetic androgen R1881-induced lipid accumulation and completely
abrogated the development of androgen-independent LNCaP cell clones via targeting
SREBP1/2. Together, these mechanistic studies suggest that silibinin would be
effective against PCA by targeting critical aberrant lipogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

have recognized that the metabolic rewiring aiding cancer
growth are not just limited to glucose metabolism but
also involved other metabolic fluxes including lipid and
amino acids [3, 4]. The importance of lipids in cancer
progression was established after several studies showing
that normal cells, excluding liver and adipose, meet their
requirement of lipids through uptake of free fatty acids
from the diet; however, in case of cancer cells, more
than 90% of their elevated lipid needs, are fulfilled by
de novo lipogenesis [5-7]. Regarding prostate cancer
(PCA), several studies have shown that its precursor

Dysregulated metabolism is now accepted as one
of the hallmarks of cancer [1], and metabolic alterations
supporting high growth rate and energy requirements are
essential for the sustained tumor growth and progression.
The initial observations showcasing the fact that tumor
cells are highly glycolytic in nature, led to studies
focusing on metabolic variations as a target for cancer
therapy [2]. Glucose metabolism henceforth has been
extensively studied; however, in recent years, studies

lesions undergo exacerbated endogenous lipogenesis,
irrespective of extracellular or circulating lipids levels
[6-8]. The higher de novo lipogenesis in PCA cells has
been linked with their increased demand for membranes,
energy storage, redox balance, protection from cell death,
and activation of several intracellular signaling pathways
during uncontrolled cellular proliferation [6-9]. Besides,
during androgen deprivation therapy, lipids (cholesterol)
play an important role in the de novo synthesis of
androgens by PCA cells, providing them self-sufficiency
in androgen receptor (AR) signaling and hormonerefractory progression [10, 11]. This unique dependence
of PCA cells on lipids for their growth and progression
provides an excellent opportunity to reduce PCA burden
via inhibiting lipogenesis and associated molecular
regulators using non-toxic small molecules. Silibinin,
isolated from the seeds of milk thistle (Silybum marianum)
plant, is widely consumed as a hepatoprotective agent and
has shown strong efficacy against PCA both as anti-cancer
and chemopreventive agent in various cell culture and
animal models, and is currently being investigated for its
beneficial effects in PCA patients [12-17]. Accordingly, in
the present study, employing both PCA and non-neoplastic
prostate epithelial cells, for the first time we examined the
detailed effect of silibinin on cellular lipid levels as well
as molecular regulators of lipogenesis.
In PCA cells, glucose-derived carbons are shunted
from the mitochondrial TCA cycle (as citric acid) to
cytosol for lipid synthesis. Importantly, expression and
activity of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis such as
ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl Co-A carboxylase
(ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl-CoA
desaturase 1 (SCD1) are upregulated and play an important
role in PCA [6, 7, 9, 18, 19]. Furthermore, the expression
of master transcriptional regulator of lipid synthesis
enzymes, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1
(SREBP1), is strongly correlated with Gleason grade [7,
20]. SREBP1 overexpression alone is sufficient to increase
tumorigenicity and invasiveness of PCA cells, while its
inhibition decreases de novo fatty acid synthesis and
causes PCA growth inhibition and apoptosis induction [6,
20]. SREBP1 is also the critical link between oncogenic
signaling and tumor metabolism [7]. For example, Akt
and mTORC1 promote nuclear accumulation of mature
SREBP1, and in turn Akt/mTORC1 signaling is activated
by SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis [21]. Similarly, a
negative regulator of mTOR pathway, AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) is reported to phosphorylate
SREBP1 and prevent its proteolytic activation [6, 8]. Our
extensively published studies have shown that silibinin
targets various components of oncogenic signaling in a
panel of human and mouse PCA cells and animal models
[22-26]; however, silibinin effect on SREBP1 expression
as well as its role in the anti-cancer efficacy of silibinin
have not been examined yet. Results from present study
showed that silibinin effectively decreases SREBP1

expression through AMPK activation in PCA cells, and
that silibinin-mediated SREBP1 inhibition is critical
for its anti-cancer efficacy against PCA. Since lipid
synthesis in PCA cells is controlled by androgens, and
under low androgen conditions, lipogenesis regulators
play an important role in androgen biosynthesis [27,
28], we also examined silibinin effect on androgeninduced lipid accumulation as well as lipogenesis
regulators (SREBP1/2) expression under low androgen
conditions. Our results showed that silibinin treatment
strongly inhibited the synthetic androgen R1881-induced
lipid accumulation as well as completely abrogated the
development of androgen-independent clones via targeting
SREBP1/2 expression under low androgen condition.

RESULTS
Human PCA cells exhibit lipogenic phenotype
In order to understand how PCA cells are unique
in terms of their metabolic profile, we first evaluated a
series of prostate/PCA cell lines for their glucose and
fat uptake rates as well as endogenous lipid levels. We
selected non-neoplastic benign human prostate RWPE1, and neoplastic cells (WPE1-NA22 and WPE1-NB14)
derived from RWPE-1 [29], and a panel of human
PCA cell lines (androgen dependent LNCaP as well as
androgen-independent DU145 and PC3 cells), and also
included non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) A549
cells for comparison. As shown in Figure 1A, prostate/
PCA cell lines did uptake glucose that was dependent
upon their individual cell growth rate in culture; however,
there was no clear trend correlating glucose consumption
with aggressiveness of these cell lines, e.g. glucose
consumption between non-neoplastic RWPE-1 and
prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cells was almost similar
(Figure 1A). Interestingly, glucose uptake by prostate/
PCA cells was much lower when compared with NSCLC
A549 cells (Figure 1A), suggesting their relatively lesser
dependence on glucose metabolism.
Next, we assessed the uptake of fatty acids by these
cell lines and to our surprise, all prostate cell lines showed
much higher fatty acid uptake compared to A549 cells
(Figure 1B). Also, there was some trend in terms of higher
fatty acid uptake correlating with cells’ aggressiveness,
e.g. fatty acid uptake trend of WPE1-NB14 > WPE1-NA22
>RWPE-1 matches with their aggressiveness (Figure
1B). On the contrary, LNCaP cells showed higher fatty
acid uptake compared with more aggressive DU145 and
PC3 cells, which might be related with the functional AR
signaling in LNCaP cells (Figure 1B). Together, glucose
and fatty acid uptake data underline the dependence of
prostate cells on fatty acid precursors compared to A549
cells, which are more glycolytic in nature.

Next, we assessed the neutral lipid content of
various prostate/PCA cells by Oil red O (ORO) staining
that mainly stains cellular cholesteryl esters and neutral
triglycerides. In this assay, we included non-neoplastic
immortalized PWR-1E cells along with other cell
lines (RWPE-1, WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, LNCaP,

DU145 and PC3). We observed higher ORO staining in
all PCA cells, with LNCaP cells showing highest lipid
accumulation, while least staining was observed in nonneoplastic PWR-1E and RWPE-1 cells (Figure 1C). This
data supported the notion that PCA cells have higher
content of neutral lipids.

Silibinin specifically inhibits neutral lipid,
cholesterol and citrate levels in PCA cells

The mammalian SREBP1 is synthesized as 125 kDa
precursor with an N-terminal transcription factor domain.
In its inactive form, the precursor SREBP1 is present in a
complex with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP),
which in turn is bound with another protein, INSIG, and
this complex remains bound to the ER membrane [30].
During starvation or sterol depleted condition, there is a
decrease in the SCAP-INSIG interaction and the SCAPSREBP complex translocates to the Golgi apparatus
where two sequential proteolytic cleavage marks the
activation of SREBPs [31]. The mature soluble SREBP1
(68 kDa) rapidly translocate to the nucleus and activates
the target genes by binding to the sterol response element
(SRE) within their promoter regions [32]. Since we did
not observe any change in SREBP1 mRNA levels with
silibinin treatment, but there was a decrease in nuclear
SREBP1 levels, we next examined the SREBP1 precursor
level after treatment with silibinin and found that while
the precursor SREBP1 level was increased, the mature
SREBP1 level was decreased, further validating that
silibinin inhibits the proteolytic cleavage of SREBP1
(Figure 2C). Next, to confirm inhibitory effect of silibinin
on nuclear SREBP1, we employed confocal microscopy,
and as shown in Figure 2D (images and bar diagram),
SREBP1 expression was mainly nuclear in untreated PCA
cells and silibinin treatment reduced the nuclear SREBP1
level while significantly increasing the cytoplasmic
SREBP1 level.
Next, we examined the effect of silibinin on the
protein expression of several genes whose expression
is controlled transcriptionally by SREBPs. As shown
in Figure 2E, silibinin treatment strongly decreased the
FASN level in both LNCaP and DU145 cells. ACC is
another important enzyme involved in maintaining fatty
acid homeostasis by catalyzing the carboxylation of
acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA. This step precedes the
fatty acid synthesis steps catalyzed by FASN, therefore,
ACC is considered an important target in PCA [33]. ACC
is inactivated by a phosphorylation at Serine-79 site by
AMPK or at Serine-1200 site by protein kinase A [34].
We found that there was a significant up-regulation of
ACC phosphorylation at Serine-79 site especially in
LNCaP cells by silibinin without any significant change
in total ACC level (Figure 2E), suggesting an inactivation
of ACC following silibinin treatment. Another key
regulator of de novo fatty acid synthesis is ACLY [35].
We found that silibinin inhibited the phosphorylation of
ACLY at Serine-455 site (Figure 2E), thereby stopping
the utilization of citrate for synthesis of acetyl-CoA.
3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR)
catalyzes the rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.
It is suggested to be an important player in PCA
progression, as it is shown to contribute to intra-tumoral
androgen synthesis [10]. We found that silibinin strongly
decreased the HMGCR level in both LNCaP and DU145
cells (Figure 2E). Another metabolic gene α-methylacyl-

Since we observed that PCA cells possess higher
turnover rates of lipid and cholesterol discussed above,
we next chose to assess whether silibinin treatment could
affect the lipid content in these cells. As shown in Figure
1D and 1E, silibinin treatment significantly reduced the
neutral lipid level in PCA LNCaP and DU145 cells but not
in non-neoplastic PWR-1E cells. Since ORO dye stains for
cholesteryl esters, we next assessed the effect of silibinin
on unesterified cholesterol by Filipin III staining. Similar
to the results obtained with neutral lipids, we observed
a significant decrease in the unesterified cholesterol
following silibinin treatment in both LNCaP and DU145
cells but not in PWR-1E cells (Figure 1F).
Normal prostate cells are also known to produce
and secrete high amount of citrate into the seminal fluid;
however, PCA cells overexpress ACLY, an enzyme that
converts citrate to acetyl CoA, which is the substrate
for fatty acid biosynthesis. ACLY-catalyzed reaction
also generates energy (NADPH) required for fatty acid
synthesis. Therefore, next, we measured the level of
intracellular citrate in prostate/PCA cells. We observed
that the cancer cells especially WPE1-NB14, LNCaP and
DU145 have higher level of intracellular citrate (Figure
1G), corresponding to higher lipid accumulation in these
cells (Figure 1C), and importantly, silibinin treatment
significantly reduced the citrate levels in WPE1-NB14,
LNCaP and DU145 cells (Figure 1G).

Silibinin decreases nuclear SREBP1 level via
inhibiting its proteolytic activation, and thus
down-regulates SREBPs target genes involved in
fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism in PCA cells
SREBPs regulate the transcriptional activation
of several genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and
cholesterol metabolism; therefore, we next analyzed the
effect of silibinin on SREBP1 and 2 expression levels.
Silibinin treatment did not significantly alter the total
levels of the SREBP1/2 in both LNCaP and DU145 cells
(data not shown); however, there was a profound decrease
in the nuclear SREBP1 following silibinin treatment in
both LNCaP and DU145 cells but not in PWR-1E cells
(Figure 2A). Similarly, a decrease in SREBP2 protein
level was evident only in the nuclear fractions of LNCaP
and DU145 cells but not in PWR-1E cells following
silibinin treatment (Figure 2A). The observed decrease in nuclear
SREBP1 levels by silibinin could be through its effect on
SREBP1 transcription and/or through post-translational
modifications. To address that, we first examined silibinin
effect on SREBP1 mRNA level after 24 and 48 h of its
treatment, but found no effect on SREBP1 mRNA level
(Figure 2B).

Silibinin regulates SREBP1 expression via
activating AMPK

CoA racemase (AMACR) is reported to be overexpressed
in PCA [36]. It is a peroxisomal and mitochondrial
enzyme capable of racemizing the α-carbon of various
α-methylacyl-CoA derivatives. We found that silibinin
also strongly down-regulated the expression of AMACR
especially in LNCaP cells.

To examine potential mechanisms of silibininmediated decrease in SREBP1 expression, we focused on
signaling mechanisms that regulate SREBP1 expression
at post-translational level. One of the key signaling

blotting. Membranes were stripped and reprobed for TBP and tubulin as nuclear and cytoplasmic loading controls, respectively. (B) RTPCR analysis showing mRNA expression of SREBP1 after treatment with silibinin (90 μM) for 24 and 48 h. GAPDH was used as loading

molecules, known to regulate SREBP1, is AMPK, which
is an energy-sensing molecule with serine/threonine
kinase activity and is activated in the cells in response
to metabolic stress (with a higher AMP/ATP ratio) [37].
Once activated via phosphorylation at Threonine-172
site, AMPK inhibits bioenergetic pathways, especially
lipogenesis by either direct phosphorylation of ACC
or indirectly (via targeting SREBP1) to reduce the
transcriptional activity of lipogenic genes such as FASN
and ACLY [38]. Since we found down-regulation of
SREBP1 and its target genes by silibinin, we inferred that
this effect could be mediated by up-regulation of AMPK.
Indeed, treatment with silibinin resulted in a robust upregulation of AMPK phosphorylation in LNCaP and
DU145 cells at 12 h that was completely inhibited in
the presence of AMPK inhibitor, compound C (Figure
3A), prior to a decrease in SREBP1 expression by ~16 h
following silibinin treatment (data not shown). Activated
AMPK is known to inhibit SREBP1 activation and nuclear
translocation by phosphorylating it at Serine-372 site
[39], and thus we also employed confocal microscopy to
assess whether SREBP1 was phosphorylated by AMPK at
Serine-372 site. A prolific increase in the phosphorylated
levels of SREBP1 was observed in both LNCaP and
DU145 cells in response to silibinin treatment (Figure 3B).
Consistent with these findings, next we examined whether
inhibiting silibinin-caused AMPK activation would
reverse silibinin effect on lipid accumulation. Indeed
AMPK inhibitor compound C alone treatment resulted in
a significant increase in lipid accumulation in both LNCaP
and DU145 cells as measured by ORO staining, and when
combined with silibinin, it reversed the inhibitory effect
of silibinin on lipid accumulation in these PCA cell lines
(Figure 3C, left and right panels).

synthesis would essentially deprive the cells of cellular
biomolecules for membrane synthesis and other processes
important for cell division, we propounded that silibininmediated reduction in lipid level would be associated
with its (earlier reported) PCA cell growth inhibitory
effects [12, 22, 23]. Accordingly, we next examined the
effect of silibinin and fatostatin on cell cycle progression
and cell proliferation. Fatostatin and silibinin alone or
in combination resulted in comparable G1 phase arrest;
56%, 59% and 61% cells in G1 phase compared to 48%
in control, respectively (Figure 3F). Similarly, individual
treatment of fatostatin or silibinin resulted in 38% and
32% decrease in total cell number and their combination
caused 42% decrease in total cell number (Figure 3G).
Together, these results validated that both fatostatin and
silibinin act by targeting the same molecule, i.e. SREBP1.

SREBP1 overexpression abrogates anti-PCA
effects of silibinin
To test directly whether SREBP1 plays an essential
role in the down-regulation of lipid accumulation and
inhibition of cell growth in PCA cells by silibinin, we
transduced DU145 cells with a lentiviral expression vector
constitutively driving the expression of SREBP1. After
lentiviral infection and selection, positive clones were
checked for SREBP1 expression by immunoblot analysis
to confirm the transduction and SREBP1 overexpression in
SREBP1-DU145 cells compared to vector control-DU145
(VC-DU145) cells (Figure 4A). Next, effect of silibinin
treatment was examined on neutral lipid content in both
VC-DU145 and SREBP1-DU145 cells. We observed
a 22% increase in the lipid content in SREBP1-DU145
cells compared with VC-DU145 cells, but importantly,
the induced SREBP1 over-expression abrogated silibininmediated inhibitory effect on the lipid content (Figure
4B). The lipid content was reduced by 32% in VC-DU145
by silibinin, but only by 10% in SREBP1-DU145 cells
(Figure 4B).
As mentioned above, since silibinin also induces
a cytostatic effect in PCA cells by inducing a G1 arrest,
we next questioned whether over-expression of SREBP1
would abrogate this effect of silibinin. We found that
silibinin treatment of VC-DU145 cells resulted in a G1
arrest (59% cells in G1 phase compared to 51% in DMSO
vehicle control, p≤0.001), but this effect of silibinin
was compromised in SREBP1-DU145 cells showing no
change in the cell cycle distribution (Figure 4C). Next, we
compared the effect of silibinin treatment on cell growth in
VC-DU145 and SREBP1-DU145 cells. Photomicrographs
captured at the end of silibinin treatment clearly showed
that it has a strong effect on the morphology and growth
of VC-DU145 cells but not SREBP1-DU145 cells (Figure
4D, upper panel). Further quantitative analysis confirmed
that whereas silibinin causes a strong and dose-dependent

Silibinin does not show additional efficacy against
PCA cells in the presence of SREBP inhibitor
fatostatin
Fatostatin (FS) is a synthetic inhibitor of SREBPs
and has been shown to block the activation of SREBPs,
thereby decreasing the transcription activity of downstream
effectors [40]. Since we observed that silibinin mediates a
similar action on SREBPs, we did an analogue experiment
to further confirm that silibinin inhibits lipogenesis in PCA
cells solely via SREBPs inhibition. Fatostatin treatment
alone or in combination with silibinin resulted in a
decrease in nuclear SREBP1, with combination showing a
better decrease compared with either fatostatin or silibinin
alone (Figure 3D). However, the decrease in neutral lipid
level observed with combination was comparable to either
agent alone, where fatostatin alone reduced the lipid
content by 48%, silibinin by 51% and there combination
by 54%, suggesting that there was no significant additional
effect in combination (Figure 3E). Since inhibiting lipid

Silibinin inhibits androgen-induced lipid
accumulation as well as androgen independent
growth of LNCaP cells via targeting SREBPs

decrease in the cell growth of VC-DU145 cells, there was
almost no growth inhibitor effect of silibinin in SREBP1DU145 cells (Figure 4D, lower panel). Together, these
results clearly suggested that silibinin-caused PCA
inhibition is mainly via inhibiting SREBP1 and lipid
accumulation in PCA cells.

Androgens
such
as
testosterone
and
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are known to induce neutral
lipid accumulation in LNCaP cells, while androgen
antagonist Casodex inhibits lipogenesis [41]. This

suggests that lipid accumulation and synthesis in PCA
cells is influenced by androgens. In light of the fact that
silibinin inhibits AR signaling in PCA cells [42, 43],
we also sought to understand whether the inhibitory
effect of silibinin on lipid content was mediated via its
inhibitory effect on androgen-AR signaling. To study
this, we stimulated LNCaP cells with 10 nM R1881 under
charcoal stripped serum (cFBS) condition. We observed a
robust accumulation of lipid in LNCaP cells in response
to R1881 treatment, but silibinin addition along with
R1881 completely inhibited the R1881-induced neutral
lipid accumulation in these cells (Figure 5A). In another
experiment, we cultured these cells in media containing
R1881 for 96 h and treated them with silibinin after 24 h
(i.e. for last 72 h) or after 72 h (i.e. only for last 24 h); we
nonetheless found inhibition in lipid accumulation (Figure
5A, lower panel), advocating that silibinin could inhibit
the androgen-induced lipid accumulation in PCA cells.
It is now believed that androgen-independent growth
of PCA cells also depends upon lipogenesis, as lipids
(such as cholesterol) act as precursors for the synthesis
of androgens [44]. Accordingly, next we also examined
whether silibinin could inhibit the hormone-refractory
growth of PCA cells through its inhibitory effect on
key lipogenesis regulator SREBP1/2. LNCaP cells were
grown to 70% confluency and then shifted to androgen
free 10% cFBS containing media and maintained in
this media till androgen-independent clones emerged.
Androgen withdrawal led to inhibition in cell growth,
but significant increase in cell death started only after
3-4 weeks of cFBS treatment. Throughout the study,
cells were washed and fresh media was added every 3rd

day. In the control group, after 18 weeks of androgen
withdrawal, we found development and re-growth of
androgen-independent clones; however, in the flasks
with 10 µM silibinin treatment, there was no re-growth
or appearance of colonies even after 23rd week (Figure
5B), which suggests that silibinin inhibited the attainment
of androgen-independent phenotype. RNA analysis of
LNCaP cells collected at different time-points following
androgen withdrawal, showed that SREBP1 and SREBP2
expression did not decrease much and/or remained higher
even under androgen deprived conditions, but silibinin
treatment reduced their expression at all the time-points
(Figure 5C). This finding further supported our hypothesis
that silibinin treatment specifically inhibited SREBP1
and SREBP2, which are important for the androgenindependent growth of these LNCaP PCA cells.

DISCUSSION
PCA is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in
US men and according to the American Cancer Society
reports, 233,000 new cases and 29,480 deaths from PCA
are estimated in the United States in 2014 [45]. Although
curative measures exist for PCA management, significant
toxicity is associated with them and thousands of patients
succumb to this deadly malignancy every year. Clearly,
additional approaches and strategies are needed to better
understand and target PCA. One such unique opportunity
is to target aberrant lipogenesis in PCA, because a
plethora of studies in recent years have shown that this
metabolic feature is essential for PCA proliferation,
survival, bioenergetics, chemoresistance, etc. [6-9, 19,

Figure 6: Schematic representation of silibinin-mediated action against lipogenesis and cell growth inhibition in PCA.
Silibinin treatment activated AMPK, enhanced SREBP1 phosphorylation, decreased SREBP1 nuclear translocation and expression of
SREBP1 regulated genes, thereby inhibited lipid accumulation and cell proliferation, and induced cell cycle arrest in PCA cells.

20, 46, 47]. However, studies focusing on understanding
and targeting aberrant lipid metabolism in PCA cells by
non-toxic natural agents are lacking, although a series of
such agents have been studied extensively for their PCA
efficacy [22, 48]. Results from the present study, for the
first time, clearly suggest that natural flavonoid silibinin
targets cellular lipid accumulation and, thereby, inhibits
PCA cell proliferation.
Prostate tissue is unique in terms of endogenous
citrate secretion and turnover. The human prostate gland
accumulates and secrets extraordinarily high levels of
citrate and zinc in the prostatic fluid (citrate concentration
ranges from 40 to 150 mM), which is not found in any
other tissues in the body [49]. However, PCA cells, instead
of secreting citrate, divert it towards lipogenesis. In PCA
cells, citric acid, produced in mitochondrion, is transported
to the cytoplasm via citrate-pyruvate shuttle, where it is
cleaved by ACLY to generate energy and acetyl CoA, a
precursor for lipid biosynthesis. In the present study, we
observed higher intracellular citrate level in PCA cells
(WPE1-NB14, LNCaP and DU145 cells) compared to
non-neoplastic RWPE-1 and less aggressive WPE1NA22 cells. This suggests that PCA cells utilize citrate
for de novo lipogenesis, and silibinin treatment reduced
the intracellular citrate level via down-regulating ACLY
expression. The decrease in intracellular citrate level
by silibinin was also well reflected in the inhibition of
neutral lipid droplets in PCA cells. Importantly, PCA cells
consistently showed a higher lipid level compared with
non-neoplastic prostate cells, which is in line with earlier
published report showing an aberrant accumulation of
esterified cholesterol in lipid droplets of high-grade PCA
and metastases [50]. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of
silibinin on neutral lipid and cholesterol level was quite
specific to PCA cells and no significant change was
observed in neutral lipid and cholesterol level in nonneoplastic PWR-1E cells following silibinin treatment.
Moreover, a decrease in lipid level by silibinin correlated
with its PCA specific growth inhibitory effects reported in
this study as well as earlier [51]. This could be explained
by the fact that most of the normal cells do not require
de novo lipogenesis, and therefore, normal cells are less
sensitive to inhibition of this pathway by silibinin.
Lipogenesis is mainly controlled by SREBPs, and
aberrant activation of SREBPs as well as their target genes
has been reported in several cancer types, including PCA
[52]. Huang et al have reported that SREBP1 is highly
expressed in the nuclei of prostate tumor cells with higher
Gleason grades, which correlates with poor prognosis
and androgen-independent PCA progression [20]. Results
from the present study showed that silibinin decreases the
nuclear SREBP1/2 expression specifically in PCA cells.
Earlier studies have clearly established that mTORC1
promotes nuclear accumulation of mature SREBP1 [21],
while a negative regulator of mTOR pathway, AMPK,
physically interacts and phosphorylates SREBP1 (at
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Ser-372 site) and suppresses its proteolytic cleavage
and nuclear translocation [6, 8]. You et al reported that
AMPK inhibition leads to activation of SREBP1-mediated
lipogenesis [53]. Similarly, AMPK inhibition has been
suggested as a causal event in ethanol-induced fatty
liver [53]. AMPK activation restricts anabolic pathways
including lipogenesis and represses cancer cells growth
and induces apoptosis [54-58]. Therefore, we conjectured
that silibinin might inhibit SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis
through AMPK activation. Indeed, our results showed
that silibinin strongly up-regulates AMPK activation in
PCA cells, followed by robust inhibitory phosphorylation
of SREBP1 at Serine-372 site. AMPK inhibition by
compound C also resulted in up-regulation of lipid
biosynthesis. This is in line with earlier report by Shi et
al that inhibiting AMPK in hepatocytes resulted in lipid
droplet accumulation [59]. Importantly, AMPK-mediated
SREBP1 inactivation by silibinin seems to be central to its
anti-PCA effects (Figure 6), as AMPK inhibitor reversed
the inhibitory effect of silibinin on lipid accumulation, and
also silibinin did not exert any additional efficacy against
PCA cells in the presence of SREBP1 inhibitor fatostatin.
Furthermore, growth inhibitory effects of silibinin
were completely reversed in PCA cells overexpressing
SREBP1. Together, these results suggest that SREBP1 is
a novel silibinin target and plays a central role in silibinin
efficacy against PCA cells (Figure 6).
De novo androgen synthesis and sustained activation
of AR signaling are the central events during PCA regrowth under low androgen conditions during hormonal
ablation therapy [60-65]. There are several studies
suggesting that intra-tumoral androgens could be derived
from de novo synthesized cholesterol as well as circulating
cholesterol from diet [10, 44, 66]. Ettinger et al reported
that in LNCaP xenograft model, expression levels of both
SREBP1a and SREBP1c were significantly enhanced in
mice 2-3 weeks following castration compared to their
basal levels [28]. Similar results were also observed in
clinical PCA specimens showing an up-regulation of
SREBPs and their downstream effector genes during
progression to androgen independence [28]. Results from
the present study suggested that silibinin could prevent
PCA hormone-refractory progression via targeting
SREBP1/2 expression. Further studies are however needed
in future to confirm silibinin effect on de novo synthesis of
androgens from cholesterol and resultant activation of AR
signaling in PCA cells especially under in vivo conditions.
In conclusion, our results clearly show that silibinin
decreases nuclear level of SREBP1 and lipid accumulation
in PCA cells as a novel mechanism of its action against
PCA growth and progression. Together, these mechanistic
findings suggest that non-toxic silibinin could be useful
in PCA prevention and treatment via targeting aberrant
lipogenesis.

All the cell lines were from from ATCC (Manassas,
VA). LNCaP, DU145, PC3 and A549 cells were cultured
in RPMI1640 media with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum).
PWR-1E, RWPE-1, WPE-NA22 and WPE-NB14 were
maintained in keratinocyte growth medium with 5 ng/
mL human recombinant epidermal growth factor and 0.05
mg/mL bovine pituitary extract; and as per experimental

or serum free keratinocyte growth medium. Media, serum
and other cell culture materials were from Invitrogen-Life
Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Silibinin and fatostatin
were from Sigma (St Louis, MO) and dissolved in DMSO
as stock solution. The final concentration of DMSO in
the culture medium during different treatments did not
exceed 0.1% (v/v). Antibodies for SREBP1, HMGCR, and
TATA-binding protein (TBP) were obtained from Abcam
(Cambridge, MA).Total and/or phosphorylated antibodies
for SREBP1, SREBP2, FASN, ACC, ACYL, AMPK,

from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). R1881 was from Perkin
Elmer (Waltham, MA). ECL detection system and antimouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody were from GE
Healthcare (Buckinghamshire, UK).

Citrate content in the cells was measured using
the citrate colorimetric/fluorometric assay kit from
Biovision (Milpitas, CA). Cells were treated with 0.1%
DMSO or silibinin (90 µM) for 48 h. Thereafter, cells
were homogenized with 100 µl of citrate assay buffer and
centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove cell
debris. Cell lysates containing equal amount of proteins
were used for the deproteinization step which was done
with 10 kDa molecular weight cut off spin columns
(BioVision, Cat # 1997-25). The samples were then
processed as per the manufacturer’s protocol, and final
concentration of citrate was obtained after extrapolation
from the citrate standard curve.

Oil Red O (ORO) staining
Cells were seeded at 50,000 cells/ well in a 6
well plate. At the end of desired treatment, cells were
fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 15 minutes at room
temperature, washed twice with distilled water and then
with 60% isopropanol for 5 minutes. After isopropanol
wash, the plate was completely dried and stained with
ORO stain (0.3% ORO in 100% isopropanol, diluted
with distilled water in the ratio of 3:2) for 30 minutes.
After staining, cells were washed with distilled water to
get a clear background. Pictures were captured at 200x
magnification under a microscope and lipid content
quantitation was carried out by dye elution using
100% isopropanol and absorbance was measured by
spectrophotometer at 500 nm.

Glucose uptake assay
Glucose uptake was measured using the glucose
assay-cell based assay kit from Caymen chemicals (Ann
Arbor, MI). Cells were seeded at the density of 10,000
cells per well in a 96-well plate and maintained at 37ºC in
CO2 incubator for 24 h. Next day, the media was removed
and replaced with glucose free RPMI. After the end of 6
h, media containing 2-NBDG (150 µg/ml) was added to
each well and incubated for 30 minutes in dark. Thereafter,
media was removed and processed as per manufacture
description. The fluorescence was measured using a plate
reader at λex=485 nm and λem=535 nm.

Cholesterol estimation
Cells were seeded at the density of 10,000 cells per
well in a 96 well plate. After 24 h of cell seeding, complete
media was replaced with serum free media with or without
silibinin treatment for 48 h. Cholesterol content in cells
was detected using cholesterol cell based detection assay
kit from Caymen chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI) following
manufacturer’s protocol.

Fatty acid uptake assay

Cell growth and cell cycle distribution assays

Fatty acid uptake was measured using QBT™ fatty
acid uptake assay from Molecular devices (Sunnyvale,
CA) following manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were
seeded at 50,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate. After 24 h
of cells seeding, complete media was replaced with serum
free RPMI media for 6 h. The cells were treated with 100
µl of 1x loading buffer and transferred to a fluorescent

mRNA levels were quantified by RT-PCR following
standard procedures. GAPDH was used as the loading
control.

Cells were grown on cover slips and treated with
DMSO or silibinin (90 µM). At the end, cells were
fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 30 minutes at room
temperature followed by gentle PBS wash three times, and
permeabilized with PBST (PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100) for
2 h with gentle shaking; and then blocked for 1 h in CAS
block buffer (Invitrogen, 1:1 in PBS). Next, cells were
incubated with respective primary antibodies, SREBP1
(1: 500) and pSREBP1 (1: 200) after diluting in PBST
(with 1% BSA) overnight with gentle shaking. Thereafter,
cells were washed with PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, and
finally cells were incubated with rabbit Alexa-Fluor 488
secondary antibody for 1 h. The coverslips were washed
with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and mounted
on slides with ProLong® Gold Antifade Mountant from
Invitrogen-Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Images
were captured at 1000x magnification on a Nikon inverted
confocal microscope using 488/405 nm laser wavelengths
to detect SREBP1 or pSREBP1 (green) and DAPI (blue)
emissions, respectively. Average fluorescence intensity
was quantified using Image J software. In both control
and treatment groups, the intensity plot was generated
from 20 cells captured from different areas. The corrected
cell fluorescence (CF) was obtained after normalizing
to the background fluorescence using the formula:
CF= Integrated Density - (Area of selected cell x Mean
fluorescence of background readings)

Western blotting
Cells were treated with DMSO or silibinin and
whole cell or nuclear/cytoplasmic extracts were prepared
and immunoblotting was performed following published
methods [67]. As needed, 60 µg of protein lysate per
sample was denatured in 2x sample buffer and subjected to
sodium dodecylsulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) on 8-16% Tris–glycine gel (as required
based upon the protein molecular weight). The separated
proteins were transferred on to nitrocellulose membrane
followed by blocking with 5% non-fat milk powder (w/v)
in Tris-buffered saline (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 100
mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature.
Membranes were probed for the protein levels of desired
molecules using specific primary antibodies followed by
the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
and visualized by ECL detection system. As required,
membranes were also stripped and re-probed again for
protein of interest or with appropriate loading control
antibody. The autoradiograms/bands were scanned with
Adobe Photoshop 6.0(Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). In
each case, blots were subjected to multiple exposures on
the film to make sure that the band density is in the linear
range.

R1881 stimulation and androgen-deprivation
growth studies
LNCaP cells (2X105 per plate) were seeded, and 24
h later, cells were starved for 24 h in 10% cFBS media,
and then treated daily with R1881 (10 nM in ethanol) with
or without silibinin (90 µM) for 3 or 4 days or induced
with R1881 for 4 days and silibinin (90 µM) added only
for last 72 or 24 h. At the end of each treatment, cells were
fixed and stained with ORO. For androgen deprivation
studies, LNCaP cells were grown to 70% confluency and
then shifted to androgen free 10% cFBS containing media,
and maintained in this media till androgen independent
clones emerged. Cells were washed and fresh media was
added after every 3rd day. In the silibinin treatment group,
10 µM silibinin was added every time to the fresh media.
Cells were collected and RNA was isolated from cells at
different time-points following androgen withdrawal.

Generation of DU145-vector control and SREBP1
overexpressing stable cell lines
DU145 cells were transfected with lentiviral
particles containing pLX304-SREBP1 (Clone ID:
ccsbBroad304_06995) or vector control pLX304
(Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Stable transduced cells were
selected using blasticidin (10 µg/ml) in complete media
for 3-4 weeks. The individual resistant clones were picked
and grown separately and maintained in the same selection
medium.
