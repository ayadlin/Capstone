ABSTRACT
Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the most frequent cause of drug-induced liver
failure in the world. Hepatic c-jun NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation is
thought to be a consequence of oxidative stress produced during APAP metabolism.
Activation of JNK signals causes hepatocellular damage with necrotic and apoptotic
cell death. Here we found that APAP caused a feedback increase in plasma adenosine
5′-monophsphate (5′-AMP). We demonstrated that co-administration of APAP and
5′-AMP significantly ameliorated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in mice, without influences
on APAP metabolism and its analgesic function. The mechanism of protection by 5′-AMP
was through inhibiting APAP-induced activation of JNK, and attenuating downstream
c-jun and c-fos gene expression. This was triggered by attenuating apoptosis signalregulated kinase 1(ASK1) methylation and increasing ubiquitination-mediated ASK1
protein degradation. Our findings indicate that replacing the current APAP with a safe
and functional APAP/5′-AMP formulation could prevent APAP-induced hepatotoxicity.

INTRODUCTION

death can result in severe centrilobular hepatotoxicity and
acute liver failure [7–8].
In APAP-induced liver injury, hepatic JNK
activation is thought to be a consequence of oxidative
stress produced during APAP metabolism [9]. Inhibiting
or silencing expression of JNK1 and JNK2 markedly
protected the liver against APAP-induced injury, despite
extensive GSH depletion and covalent binding caused
by the production of NAPQI [10–11]. Recently, JNK
was reported to play a critical role in APAP-induced
hepatotoxicity in mice [12–13]; thereby identifying that
inhibition of JNK can be used as important therapeutic
way in the treatment of APAP-induced acute liver failure.
JNK is activated by sequential protein phosphorylation
through a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
module. Several MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs)
have been identified in the JNK cascade, such as apoptosis
signal-regulated kinase 1 (ASK1) [9, 14].
Adenosine 5′-monophosphate (5′-AMP) is a
natural molecule of adenosine triphosphate metabolism.
Administration of exogenous 5′-AMP displays multiple
regulatory functions and important physiological
roles [15–17]. In the present study, we identified that

Acetaminophen (APAP) is a widely used
analgesic and antipyretic drug that is safe at therapeutic
doses. However, when take at high doses or, rarely in
particularly susceptible people at therapeutic doses, APAP
can precipitate severe liver injury that can develop into
acute liver failure [1–2]. In fact, APAP overdose is the
most frequent cause of drug-induced liver failure in the
some developed countries [3]. Although much APAP is
metabolized via conjugation with glucuronic acid and
sulfate and then excreted, a portion of APAP is converted
by cytochrome P-450 metabolism to a reactive quinone
form, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which
is inactivated by conjugation with glutathione (GSH) [4].
Once the pool of GSH is exhausted, any remained
N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine covalently binds cellular
macromolecules induces a series of molecular events
that include alkylation of proteins, membrane lipid
peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, imbalance
of intracellular calcium, formation of reactive oxygen
species and reactive nitrogen species [5–6]. APAP-induced

co-administration of APAP and 5′-AMP ameliorated
significantly APAP- induced hepatotoxicity. The
mechanism of protection by 5′-AMP was through inhibiting
JNK signaling pathway and protein modification. Our
results suggest that replacing the current APAP with a safe
and functional APAP/5′-AMP formulation could prevent
APAP-induced hepatotoxicity.

used over-the-counter analgesic drug. We used formalininduced nociceptive behavioral test to investigate
whether 5′-AMP attenuated the analgesic effect of APAP.
Either pretreatment with APAP or APAP plus 5′-AMP
markedly reduced the cumulative response time of
formalin responses in both 1st phase and 2nd phase.
(Figure  2B,  2C), indicating 5′-AMP had no effect on
analgesic function of APAP.

RESULTS

5′-AMP protected against APAP-induced
hepatocellular damage in vitro

Co-administration of APAP and 5′-AMP
ameliorated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity

Cytochrome P-450 enzymes plays a major role in
the conversation of APAP into hepatotoxic N-acetyl-pbenzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) [18]. Treatment with 5′-AMP
had no influence on the expression of P450 enzymes
mRNA (Figure 3A–3C). Next, we used human hepatic
L02 cells to assess the effect of 5′-AMP on APAP-induced
hepatocellular damage. Cell viability was recovered in
5′-AMP-treated cells after APAP exposure (Figure 3D)
and the APAP-induced depletion of GSH in 5′-AMPtreated cells were significantly diminished (Figure 3E).
Furthermore, compared with control group, APAP
induced hepatocellular cell death in L02 cells, and 5′-AMP
markedly suppressed cell death (Figure 3F) with a dosedependent manner.

To identify possible changes in extracellular
nucleotides and their possible role in APAP-induced
hepatotoxicity, we looked for differences in circulatory
nucleotides between APAP-treated and control mice.
HPLC analysis from these samples indicated that the
plasma 5′-AMP, but not ATP and ADP, was elevated in
APAP-treated mice compared to control mice (Figure 1A).
We hypothesized that increased 5′-AMP was a feedback
protection against APAP-induced liver injury. Then,
wild-type mice were intragastrically challenged with
APAP (15 mg/g) or co-administration of APAP and
5′-AMP. Interestingly, the protective effects of 5′-AMP
(15, 20 mg/g) was detectable macroscopically on liver
appearance, with strong hepatic injury changes in livers
derived from APAP-treated mice, but normal liver
morphology in the mice treated with co-administration
of APAP and 5′-AMP (Figure 1B). Histological analysis
by H&E staining showed hepatocyte necrosis in the
livers of APAP mice, whereas co-administration of
APAP and 5′-AMP attenuated the area and extent of
necrosis (Figure 1C). Consistent with their reduced
histological liver damage, mice treated with APAP showed
evidence of severe liver injury at 24 h as indicated by
the significant increase of serum AST and ALT levels,
and co-administration of 5′-AMP and APAP resulted in
a significant reduction in serum AST and ALT values
compared with single APAP groups (Figure 1D). Next,
we found that the protective effects of 5′-AMP was
completely lost while mice were given 5′-AMP at 1 h after
APAP (data not shown). Together, these results revealed
that co-administration of 5′-AMP and APAP significantly
ameliorated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity.

5′-AMP inhibited APAP-induced JNK activation
The depletion of GSH by NAPQI is an important
component of APAP-induced liver injury [19]. The results
of GSH measurement demonstrated that the protective
effects of 5′-AMP against APAP-induced liver injury
was not due to inhibiting GSH consumption in early
stage. At 1 h after APAP, the bulk of hepatic GSH was
depleted to 85%, displaying equivalent depleted rate in
both groups. However, the hepatic GSH was signiﬁcantly
higher in 5′-AMP-treated mice at 24 h after APAP
treatment (Figure 4A). It is well established that APAP
hepatotoxicity causes mitochondrial dysfunction with
depletion of hepatic ATP levels [20–21]. Using HPLC,
we compared changes in ATP levels with alterations in
energy metabolism. We chose to evaluate these parameters
at different time points during the initiation of the injury
and late time when substantial was evident. ATP levels
in the livers of both mice treated with APAP and APAP
plus 5′-AMP were robustly reduced at the early stage.
Treatment with 5′-AMP did not result in an early ATP
recovery but improved the energy status at the late time
point (24 h) (Figure 4B). JNK activation is an early key
signal in mediating mitochondria-mediated lethal cell
triggered by toxicants in hepatocytes [22–23]. Therefore,
we investigated whether APAP-induced JNK activation
was attenuated by 5′-AMP. First, because c-jun and c-fos
genes are known to be JNK-dependent genes and reported
to be associated with the degree of APAP-induced- liver

5′-AMP failed to change APAP metabolism and
analgesic function
To investigate whether 5′-AMP influences APAP
metabolism, we preformed a HPLC analysis for plasma
APAP level with time course after APAP injection. 5′-AMP
failed to change APAP degradation rate during 0.5–4 h
after APAP administration. Statistics analysis revealed that
there are no significant differences of APAP degradation
rate between two groups (Figure 2A). APAP is a widely

injury, we examined the c-jun and c-fos mRNA expression
in liver at 6 h after APAP administration. Expressions of
c-jun and c-fos mRNA were significantly elevated in
APAP mice and suppressed by 5′-AMP treatment (Figure
4C, 4D). Furthermore, we used western blotting to examine
the time course of JNK activation (phosphorylation),
demonstrated JNK activation reached a peak plateau at
around 3 h after APAP treatment (data not shown). Then
we examined APAP-induced JNK activation in 5′-AMP
treated mice liver 3 h after APAP administration.
Treatment of mice with 5′-AMP significantly decreased
the levels of phospho-JNK while the total JNK levels were

unaffected (Figure 4E). Similar to JNK, MKK4 activation
was attenuated by 5′-AMP treatment (Figure 4F).

5′-AMP attenuated ASK1 level through protein
modification
MKK4 activation is regulated by phosphorylation
of ASK1. We examined whether APAP induced ASK1
activation in control mice, APAP-treated mice, and APAP
plus 5′-AMP-treated mice. ASK1 activation was observed
at 3 h after APAP administration and was significantly
attenuated by 5′-AMP. Unexpectedly, 5′-AMP significantly

decreased the total ASK1 expression (Figure 5A) in livers.
In L02 cells, total ASK1 expression was also significantly
attenuated by 5′-AMP (Figure 5B). Furthermore, the loss of
ASK1 in 5′-AMP-treated cells was prevented by MG-132
(a Proteasome inhibitor), indicating that it was undergoing
proteasome-mediated degradation (Figure  5C). To
determine whether 5′-AMP affects ASK1 protein stability,
we examined the ubiquitination and methylation of ASK1.
The high molecular bands are usually ubiquitination of
target proteins for degradation [24]. Indeed, these high
molecular mass above ASK1 protein were shown to be
polyubiquitinated (Ub) ASK1 proteins as demonstrated by
immunoprecipitation with anti-ASK1 followed by western
blot with anti-Ub. The basal ubiquitination of ASK1 was
detected and 5′-AMP treatment significantly increased
ASK1 ubiquitination (Figure 5D). Following investigation
revealed that ASK1 methylation was significantly
attenuated by 5′-AMP (Figure 5E).

revealed a novel protective role for 5′-AMP against APAPinduced hepatotoxicity. APAP treatment resulted in profound
liver cell injury and correlated with the rise in serum AST
and ALT levels. Cell injury inevitably caused intracellular
nucleotides to be released into the circulation [25]. Blood
cell-based CD39 mediates conversion of ATP and ADP
to 5′-AMP, whereas soluble 5′-nucleotidase and alkaline
phosphatase catabolize 5′-AMP to adenosine. Elevated
plasma 5′-AMP after APAP treatment implied that 5′-AMP
involved in APAP-induced liver injury. Indeed, 5′-AMP
treatment decreased the phosphorylation of JNK, MKK4,
and ASK1. JNK activation is a major component of liver
injury and is activated during hepatocyte injury caused by,
APAP, bile acids, concanavalin A, and ischemi-reperfusion
injury [26–27]. C-jun and c-fos have been reported to
be associated with the degree of APAP-induced liver
injury  [28]. Because these genes encode components of
the JNK activating pathway has been reported to mediate
hepatocyte death, activation of the JNK pathway is
considered to promote APAP-induced liver injury [29].
ASK1 is known to associate with redox-sensitive proteins
such as thioredoxin-1, which inhibits kinase activation [30].
ASK1 deficiency protected mice from APAP-induced liver
injury and reduced JNK activation, indicating that ASK1
acts as upstream of MAP3K in this process [9].

DISCUSSION
Previous findings demonstrate that 5′-AMP inhibit
inflammatory response and ameliorate LPS-induced liver
injury [17]. In the present study we found APAP treatment
caused a feedback increase in plasma 5′-AMP level, and

MATERIALS AND METHODS

5′-AMP also decreased the total ASK1 expression,
which was related to 5′-AMP- induced hyper-adenosine.
Adenosine inhibited AdoHcy hydrolysis in vitro and
in vivo. Inhibition of AdoHcyase results in the intracellular
accumulation of AdoHcy and thus potent inhibition of some
AdoMet- dependent methyltransferases [31]. The ratio of
AdoMet to AdoHcy levels is used frequently as an indicator
of cellular methylation capacity, whereby a decrease in this
ratio predicts reduced cellular methylation potential [32].
Methylated proteins were seen to have signif﻿﻿icantly
longer half-life than proteins for which no methylation
was found [33]. The functions of methylated proteins are
co-regulated by ubiquitination, phosphorylation or other
post- translational modifications [33]. In our observation,
5′-AMP attenuated the methylation of ASK1 and enhanced
the ubiquitination of ASK1, which accelerate ASK1
degradation, leading to an inhibition of MAPKs cascade.
Previous research indicated that ASK1 methylation
deceased the H2O2-induced activity of ASK, impairing
stress-induced signaling that controls a variety of cellular
events including apoptosis. [34–35].
In summary, the present study is the first to demonstrate
a significant protective effect of 5′-AMP against APAPinduce hepatotoxicity in mice. Findings from the current
study suggest that 5′-AMP plus APAP represent a promising
formulation in lowering APAP-induced hepatotoxicity.

Animals
Male wild-type C57BL/6J mice were used at
8–10 weeks of age with a body weight of 20–25 g in this
work. Mice were maintained under standard laboratory
conditions, with full access to food and water ad libitum,
and 12 h light/ 12 h dark (LD) cycles with lights on at
7:00 a.m. and off at 7:00 p.m. All experiments were in
accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and
Use Committee at Nanjing University of Science &
Technology.

Drug administration and experimental design
Acetaminophen (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved
in warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 50°C) and
cooled to 37°C before injection of mice. Mice were
fasted overnight (16–18 hours) before administration
of a single dose of acetaminophen (300 mg/kg, body
weight) together with or without 5′-AMP. All mice were
sacrificed at the indicated time periods. The blood was
collected from the carotid artery and the liver of each
mouse was removed immediately and then was kept at
−80°C until analyzed.

Figure 5: 5′-AMP influenced ASK1 modification and degradation. Mice were administered intragastrically with APAP (15 mg/g)

or co-administration of APAP (15 mg/g) and 5′-AMP (20 mg/g). (A) Activated ASK1 and total ASK1 expression were measured by western
blotting 3 h after treatment. β-actin was used as a loading control. (B) L02 cells were treated with APAP (5 mM) in presence and absence of
0.4 mM 5′-AMP for 2 h, (C) L02 cells were treated with APAP (5 mM) in presence and absence of 0.4 mM 5′-AMP, 10 μM MG132 for 2 h.
ASK1 was determined by western blotting and β-actin was used as a loading control. ASK1 was immunoprecipitated, the immunocomplexes
were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and ubiquitinated ASK1 (D) and methylated ASK1 (E) were detected by western blotting with anti-ubiquitin
and anti-mono and dimethyl Arginine. Three independent experiments were performed and representative blotting were shown.

Serum biochemistry assay and histological
analysis

Immunoblotting
Preparation of total protein extracts from mice
liver or cells was performed following the procedure
described previously [36]. The extracted proteins and
immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE 10% or
12% polyacrylamide gel and then electrically transferred
to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% (w/v) BSA
in TBST at room temperature for 1 h, the membranes
were then incubated with an appropriate specific primary
antibody (Anti-JNK1/2, anti-phospho JNK1/2, antiMKK4, anti-phospho MKK4, anti-ASK1, anti-phospho
ASK1, anti-Ubiquitinin, Cell Signaling Technology,
Boston; Anti-mono and dimethyl Arginine, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA) at 4°C overnight, followed by
incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:15,000; Sunshine Biotechnology) and detected by
enhanced chemical luminescence kit (Thermo scientific,
Hudson, NH, USA). The quantiﬁcation of the bands was
performed by the Gel Analysis V2.02 Software (Clin
Science Instruments, Shanghai, China).

Activities of serum aspartate transaminase (AST)
and alanine transaminase (ALT) were measured using
an AU2700 automatic biochemical analyzer (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan). For histopathological analysis, liver tissue
was fixed in 10% phosphate buffered formalin and paraffin
embedded, and cut into 4 μm sections. Sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed
by light microscopy.

Cell culture and cell treatment
Human liver cell line L02 were maintained in
supplemented DMEM in an atmosphere at 90% humidity
containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. At the end of the preincubated
period, cells were rinsed with PBS, and the medium was
exchanged to DMEN without fetal bovine serum. The cells
were treated with APAP (5 mM) in the presence or absence of
5′-AMP (100 μM, 200 μM, 400 μM). CGS15943 (100 nM)
was stimulated 30 min before APAP. Cell viability was
determined by the MTT assay. Cell death was determined
by exposing the L02 cells to a solution containing the DNAbinding dye propidium iodide (PI). PI enters those cells with
a damage membrane, staining the DNA red. Cells were then
observed under a fluorescence microscope.

Intracellular GSH
Preparation of cell or liver lysates was performed as
described previously [6]. Reduced intracellular GSH levels
were measured using a GSH assay kit (Jianchen, Nanjing,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR

HPLC analysis

Total RNA was extracted from fresh liver samples
with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. 20 ng RNA was converted
to cDNA using reverse transcript enzyme (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed, and
results were analyzed using an ABI 7300 Detection System
utilizing SYBR Green dye (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). All
primer sequences used for quantitative RT-PCRs are
shown in Table 1. Relative gene expression in comparison
with Gapdh expression was calculated by the comparative
cycle threshold (CT) method.

Plasma APAP concentration was determined
by HPLC as described previously [37–38],
S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), S-adenosylhomocysteine
(AdoHcy), 5′-AMP, ADP and ATP were extracted from
liver samples and cells using 0.4 N perchloric acid and
analyzed by HPLC, as described previously [17]. Extracts
were seperated and quantified using reverse- phase HPLC
(Waters 1525 system; Millipore, Bedford,MA) on a
Partisphere bounded phase C18 (reverse phase) cartridge
column. Pure APAP, 5′-AMP, ADP and ATP (SigmaAldrich) were used to identify the peaks and obtain the
calibration curves.

Immunoprecipitation

Formalin treatment and nociceptive behavioral
analysis

L02 cells after various treatments were washed twice
with cold PBS and lysed in cold lysis buffer containing 50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM PMSF and fresh
protease inhibitors. The lysates were precleared with
protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C. Then lysates
were incubated with the immunoprecipitating antibody
for 1 h on ice, protein G- Sepharose beads were added
on rotator at 4°C overnight. The beads were washed four
times with lysis buffer and heated at 95°C for 5 min in
sample buffer.

Formalin-induced nociceptive test was performed
as described previously [39]. 10 μl of 1% formalin
solution, made up in physiologic normal saline, was
injected subcutaneously (s.c.) under the surface of the
left hindpaw. Mice were treated orally once with APAP
(15 mg/g) together with or without 5′-AMP (20 mg/g)
for 30 min prior to the formalin injection. Mice were
observed simultaneously from 0 to 40 min following
