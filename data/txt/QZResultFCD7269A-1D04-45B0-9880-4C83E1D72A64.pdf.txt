ABSTRACT
The tumor microenvironment, primarily composed of myofibroblasts, directly
influences the progression of solid tumors. Through secretion of growth factors,
extracellular matrix deposition, and contractile mechanotransduction, myofibroblasts,
or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), support angiogenesis and cancer cell invasion
and metastasis. The differentiation of fibroblasts to CAFs is primarily induced by
TGF-β from cancer cells. To discover agents capable of blocking CAF differentiation,
we developed a high content immunofluorescence-based assay to screen repurposed
chemical libraries utilizing fibronectin expression as an initial CAF marker. Screening
of the Prestwick chemical library and NIH Clinical Collection repurposed drug library,
totaling over 1700 compounds, identified cardiac glycosides as particularly potent
CAF blocking agents. Cardiac glycosides are traditionally used to regulate intracellular
calcium by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase to control cardiac contractility. Herein, we
report that multiple cardiac glycoside compounds, including digoxin, are able to
inhibit TGF-β-induced fibronectin expression at low nanomolar concentrations without
undesirable cell toxicity. We found this inhibition to hold true for multiple fibroblast
cell lines. Using real-time qPCR, we determined that digoxin prevented induction of
multiple CAF markers. Furthermore, we report that digoxin is able to prevent TGF-βinduced fibroblast contraction of extracellular matrix, a major phenotypic consequence
of CAF differentiation. Assessing the mechanism of inhibition, we found digoxin
reduced SMAD promoter activity downstream of TGF-β, and we provide data that the
effect is through inhibition of its known target, the Na+/K+ ATPase. These findings
support a critical role for calcium signaling during CAF differentiation and highlight a
novel, repurposable modality for cancer therapy.

C; and enhanced contractility that influences cancer cells
through mechanotransduction and ECM remodeling [1, 7].
It is well documented that the cumulative effect of this CAF
phenotype in the reactive stroma can be the promotion of
invasive and metastatic cancer [8]. It has been shown that
the presence of CAFs in the reactive stoma is correlated
with poor prognosis for cancers of multiple origins [9, 10].
Multiple studies using genetically altered fibroblasts in
mouse models support a role for the CAF phenotype in
cancer initiation and progression. For example, mouse
fibroblasts overexpressing HGF were able to initiate

Fibroblasts are known to contribute to the
development and progression of cancers as well as
fibrotic diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, scleroderma,
and chronic kidney disease [1, 2]. Tumor progression
is accompanied by the activation of stromal fibroblasts
into myofibroblasts, often termed cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) [3–6]. CAFs are characterized by
increased expression of cancer-driving growth factors,
including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular
endothelial growth factor; extracellular matrix (ECM)

cancer in implanted normal human breast epithelia [11].
MCF7 cells were shown to grow into larger tumors when
co-injected into mice with CAFs vs. normal fibroblasts
[12]. Similarly, otherwise noninvasive cancer cells become
invasive when co-injected into mice with CAFs [13].
Under normal physiological conditions feedback
mechanisms restrict myofibroblast activation; however, in
cancer and other fibrotic diseases this process can become
dysregulated, leading to constitutive activation [1, 2, 14].
Overabundance of the potent morphogenic growth factor,
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), in the tumor
microenvironment is a primary contributor to aberrant
CAF activation [15–19]. Binding of TGF-β to its receptor
on fibroblasts initiates signaling cascades including
dimerization and translocation of SMAD transcription
factors into the nucleus [20]. SMAD promoter activity
directly and indirectly regulates much of the CAF-specific
gene expression [21].
Given the impactful role of CAF in cancer
progression and fibrotic disease we sought to discover
clinically relevant agents able to block TGF-β-induced
CAF differentiation. Although some reports indicate
complete depletion of myofibroblasts from certain
tumors may worsen prognosis in mice, the authors
acknowledge, and we agree, selective inhibition of CAF
differentiation may be more efficacious by supporting
normal tissue architecture maintained by quiescent
fibroblasts [22]. To this end, we developed a high
content immunofluorescence imaging assay to screen
for compounds able to block the induction of fibronectin
expression by TGF-β in fibroblast cell lines. Two drug
libraries, the NIH Clinical Collection and the Prestwick
Chemical Library were screened for efficacy. These
libraries comprise over 1700 compounds previously
approved for safety by the FDA (Prestwick) for at least
one indication or at least used in clinical trials with
pharmacology and toxicity information. Ideally, hits from
these repurpose collections hold the potential of expedited
approval for future clinical trials [23–28].
Herein we report, for the first time, the identification
of cardiac glycosides, Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors used to
treat congestive heart failure, as potent inhibitors of TGFβ-induced CAF differentiation [29]. Results from our
compound screen highlighted this class of compounds
as hits. Secondary testing of the glycoside digoxin
using western blot analysis, real-time qPCR, and ECM
contractility assays confirmed the ability of digoxin
to prevent CAF differentiation in multiple fibroblast
lines without causing cell death. The effects of digoxin
corresponded to its ability to reduce SMAD promoter
activity and suggest a critical role for intracellular
calcium signaling in CAF differentiation. These findings
support further evaluation of cardiac glycosides and
like compounds as therapeutic modalities for restricting
myofibroblast activity in the cancer microenvironment and
additional fibrotic diseases.

Cardiac glycosides identified as inhibitors of
fibronectin expression in a screen of repurposed
drug libraries
In order to discover compounds able to prevent
CAF differentiation, we developed a high content
immunofluorescence screen using the Cellomics Imaging
Platform. The WPMY-1 fibroblast cell line was used
for the initial screen. WPMY-1 cells were derived from
the peripheral zone of a histologically normal prostate
[30]. These cells upregulate fibronectin, and other CAF
markers, in response to overnight treatment with TGF-β
(Entrez Gene: 7040) [19]. For the screen, WPMY-1
cells arrayed in 96-well plates were treated with TGF-β
in the presence or absence of test compounds at 10 µM
for 24 hours under serum-free conditions. Changes to
fibronectin expression were quantitated based on endpoint
immunostain intensity per nuclei using a custom Cellomics
software algorithm (Figure 1A). The screen incorporated
1280 compounds from the Prestwick Chemical library
and 451 compounds from the NIH clinical collection
(Figure 1B). Of the roughly 1700 compounds tested, the
cardiac glycoside class of compounds (8 members; patent
pending #62/290,002) was found to be consistently and
potently effective at blocking TGF-β-induced fibronectin
expression (Figure 1C, 1D).
The Cellomics imaging platform and algorithm were
then used to establish a dose response curve and IC50 values
for the most effective glycosides. Again, WPMY-1 cells
were treated with TGF-β in the presence or absence of the
cardiac glycosides at concentrations ranging from 1 nM100 µM for 24 hours under serum-free conditions. The IC50
values for digoxin, strophanthin, and lanatoside C were
determined to be 30 nM, 40 nM, and 110 nM respectively
(Figure 1E–1G). Viability assays were subsequently
performed to address whether the compounds were
blocking fibronectin induction or causing a toxic response.
WPMY-1 cells were treated with digoxin, strophanthin,
or lanatoside C at their respective IC50 and assayed for
NADPH-based metabolic activity as an indication of
cell viability. No impairment to metabolic activity was
detected with any of the three glycosides through 48 hours
of treatment (Figure 1H). These results suggest cardiac
glycosides block TGF-β-induced fibronectin induction in
WPMY-1 cells without causing appreciable cell death.
Digoxin was used for subsequent studies to further
determine whether cardiac glycosides were able to prevent
the differentiation of fibroblasts to CAFs.

the WPMY-1 cell line we additionally tested the MRC-5
and HPS-19I lines. MRC-5 fibroblasts were derived from
normal lung tissue and HPS-19I from normal prostate
[31, 32]. These cell lines were treated with increasing
concentrations of digoxin in the presence or absence of
5 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 hours under serum-free conditions.
By western blot analysis of whole cell lysates, digoxin
was determined to effectively block TGF-β-induced
fibronectin induction in each of the three cell lines
(Figure  2A–2C). Moreover, it is apparent from these
results that digoxin reduces the basal level of fibronectin
expression to some extent in MRC-5 and HPS-19I, in
particular (Figure 2B, 2C). Together these data suggest the
effect of cardiac glycosides on TGF-β-induced fibronectin
induction is common to fibroblasts in general.

in general was prevented. CAF differentiation is associated
with gene expression changes to a number of common
markers including fibronectin (FN1; Entrez Gene: 2335),
α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA; Entrez Gene: 59), collagen
1a1 (Col1a1; Entrez Gene: 1277), fibroblast activation
protein (FAP; Entrez Gene: 2191), and tenascin C (TNC;
Entrez Gene: 3371) among others. Accordingly, we treated
WPMY-1 and MRC-5 cells with 120 nM digoxin, an
effective dose based on immunofluorescence and western
blot assays, in the presence or absence of 5 ng/ml TGF-β
for 24 hours under serum-free conditions. Quantitative realtime PCR was performed on these samples to evaluate gene
expression changes to FN1, αSMA, Col1a1, FAP, and TNC.
Although cell line specific distinctions were apparent, in
general, TGF-β upregulated expression of each of the CAF
markers and digoxin was able to block this induction or even
reduce the basal level of marker expression (Figure 3A, 3B).
In WPMY-1 cells, αSMA expression was exceptionally
high under basal conditions, but was greatly reduced with
the addition of digoxin. Additionally, FAP expression in the
MRC-5 cell line was an anomaly with digoxin causing it to
increase when combined with TGF-β.

differentiation
Given that cardiac glycosides were able to block
TGF-β-induced fibronectin expression in multiple fibroblast
lines, we sought to determine whether CAF differentiation

To further evaluate the ability of cardiac glycosides
to prevent CAF differentiation, we tested whether digoxin
was able to block the increased contractility characteristic
of CAFs. Either WPMY-1 cells or MRC-5 cells were
embedded in a matrix of Matrigel and collagen forming a
disc across wells of a 24-well plate. After 24 hours, cells
in the matrix were treated with TGF-β with or without
120 nM digoxin for 96 hours. Images of the matrix disks
were taken after 96 hours of contraction and the area of
each was quantitated. Digoxin was able to significantly
reduce the ability of both WPMY-1 and MRC-5 fibroblasts
to contract the extracellular matrix discs, indicative of
blocked CAF differentiation (Figure  3C,  3D). Taken
together, these data demonstrate that digoxin is able
to prevent multiple characteristic changes of CAF
differentiation elicited by TGF-β.

signaling, SMAD 2/3 (Entrez Genes: 4087/4088) and
EGR1 (Entrez Gene: 1958), in WPMY-1 fibroblasts after
24 hours of treatment with digoxin ± TGF-β [20, 33, 34].
As expected, TGF-β caused a marked increase in SMAD
promoter activity. Digoxin was able to reduce this activity
in a dose dependent manner (Figure 4A). Conversely,
EGR1 promoter activity in WPMY-1 cells was reduced
by TGF-β as well as digoxin treatment, a trend unlikely to
contribute to the effect of digoxin on CAF differentiation
(Figure 4B).
We next sought to assess whether digoxin
prevented CAF differentiation through its cognate target
of inhibition, the Na+/K+ ATPase (Entrez Gene: 476),
which would elevate intracellular calcium concentration.
It is well established that the affinity of digoxin for the
mouse Na+/K+ ATPase is 103-fold less than that for the
human protein [35]. Accordingly, we tested the efficacy
of digoxin to block fibronectin induction in the J2 mouse
fibroblast cell line. J2 cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of digoxin in the presence or absence of
TGF-β for 24 hours under serum-free conditions. Digoxin
was ineffective in the context of the mouse Na+/K+ ATPase.
TGF-β caused a modest induction of fibronectin over basal
levels, but even at the highest concentration, digoxin was
not able to reduce fibronectin levels (Figure 4C). These

activity likely through Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition
Given that digoxin was able to block global
CAF changes responsive to TGF-β, we sought to test
whether digoxin impaired TGF-β-induced transcriptional
regulation. To this end, we performed luciferase promoter
assays for two transcription factors downstream of TGF-β

CAF phenotype. Although some evidence suggests
the transcription factor EGR1 can regulate calcium
homeostasis and is upregulated downstream of TGF-β
signaling, under our experimental conditions, the changes
to EGR1 expression would not account for the effect of
digoxin on CAF differentiation [34, 36]. Given that digoxin
is largely ineffective in a mouse fibroblast line, it is likely
that digoxin works through its known target of inhibition,
the Na+/K+ ATPase [35]. This conclusion is further
supported by the fact that all represented cardiac glycosides
in the library screens were identified as potent hits (roughly
one-third of the 27 total hits from the 1731 compounds
screened), highlighting the importance of calcium signaling
downstream of TGF-β in CAF activation. Although there
are multiple reports of calcium signaling regulating
SMAD activity through direct phosphorylation by Ca2+/
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII), the
effect seems highly context dependent. Whereas CAMKII
activity promotes SMAD1 transcriptional activity in
undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, CAMKII inactivates
SMAD2 in fibroblast-like Cos-1 cells [34, 37, 38].
To evaluate the effects of digoxin on the overall
CAF phenotype, we assessed changes in gene expression

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates for the first time that the
cardiac glycoside class of drugs, particularly digoxin,
are able to block TGF-β-induced differentiation of
fibroblasts to the activated CAF phenotype. Using an
immunofluorescence-based screen of repurposed drug
libraries to assess fibronectin expression, we found
this class of drugs to be uniquely effective. Follow-up
studies concluded digoxin blocked fibronectin induction
in multiple fibroblast cell lines at low nanomolar
concentrations. This effect was without apparent cellular
toxicity or disruption of basal proliferation. By assessing
the expression of CAF markers and ECM contractility
in multiple fibroblast cell lines, we determined digoxin
inhibited the activated CAF phenotype induced by TGF-β
treatment.
Digoxin was found to reduce activity at the SMAD
promoter as a likely explanation for the restricted

of known CAF markers. These markers however, are
also functionally relevant to the progression of cancer,
in and of themselves [39]. Fibronectin and collagen I can
initiate invasive cell signaling pathways through integrin
signaling [40–44]. Elevated levels of the extracellular
glycoprotein tenascin C correlate with poor prognosis in
multiple cancer types including breast and bladder cancer
as well as being associated with increased invasiveness
[45]. α-smooth muscle actin is a critical mediator of the
contractile apparatus in myofibroblasts and is therefore
directly related to ECM remodeling [46]. Inhibition of
the serine protease fibroblast activation protein has been
shown to reduce growth in numerous mouse tumor models
[47, 48]. Digoxin was found to repress the expression of
each marker downstream of TGF-β.
In addition to gene expression changes, we found
that digoxin was able to prevent the enhanced contractile
phenotype of CAFs. Normally, enhanced contractility
of myofibroblasts is essential to the ECM reassembly
required for wound healing [49]. In addition to ECM
remodeling, constriction within a tissue microenvironment
influences cells through mechanotransduction to elicit a
motile or invasive phenotype [50]. In the context of cancer,

unresolved stromal rigidity imparts pro-invasive signals to
the progressing tumor while disrupting normal restrictive
tissue architecture [51]. A number of studies have attributed
tissue stiffness to tumor aggressiveness and promotion
of metastasis [52]. The ability of digoxin to prevent this
phenotype supports its evaluation as a therapeutic strategy
for normalizing the tumor microenvironment [53].
Although cardiac glycosides have special toxicity
considerations in patients, over a million patients
in the United States are receiving digoxin for heart
failure [29, 54]. To our knowledge, there are no reports
specifically demonstrating the ability of cardiac glycosides
to prevent CAF differentiation. Interestingly, recently
published data indicate an anti-fibrotic effect of ouabain
through upregulation of COX-2 in lung fibroblasts, likely
sharing a mechanism with our findings at the level of
SMAD activity [55]. Given the abundance of published
reports demonstrating that CAFs are able to facilitate the
invasiveness of otherwise quiescent tumor cells, work
toward the development of CAF-targeting therapeutic
agents is warranted [8]. Although some drugs against
stromal targets, such as angiogenesis inhibitors, have been
developed, options for targeting fibroblast activation are

been shown to target colorectal and non-small cell lung
cancer tumor sites in a phase I trial, but data on efficacy
is limited [56]. Our findings highlight that the Na+/K+
ATPase, as a target, and cardiac glycosides, as agents,
may be a fruitful area of research for the development of
novel therapeutics aimed at restricting fibroblast activation
and the CAF phenotype. These drugs may be particularly
useful in prostate and pancreatic cancer where the reactive
stroma, consisting of CAFs, is a major factor in tumor
progression and metastasis.

methanol for 10 minutes at –20°C, washed, and stained
with anti-fibronectin (F3648, 1:200 dilution) (SigmaAldrich) in a solution of 0.25% bovine serum albumin,
0.1% saponin, and PBS (termed BSP) at 4°C overnight.
The following day, cells were washed and incubated with
secondary 594-conjugated antibody (1:200) (Jackson

room temperature. Cells were washed and stained with
SlowFade Gold reagent with DAPI (S36938) (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) for 15 minutes and washed prior to
visualization. Cells were visualized and data collected
using the Cellomics High Content Screening platform
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cellomics software
analyzed intensity of fibronectin staining within a ring 6 to
12 pixels from the nucleus for at least 5 fields per well.
Compounds that decreased the intensity of fibronectin
staining below levels of the positive control (TGF-β alone)
and produced a response in a dose-dependent manner were
selected for further study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
The WPMY-1 prostate fibroblast cell line was
obtained from ATCC (CRL-2854) and maintained in
DMEM (Corning, Manassas, VA) 5% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Gemini, West Sacramento, CA). WPMY-1 cells
were derived from the stroma adjacent to a normal adult
prostate. The MRC-5 lung fibroblast cell line was obtained
from ATCC (CCL-171) and maintained in EMEM
(Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS. MRC-5 cells were
derived from normal fetal lung tissue. These cells were
authenticated by Promega through short tandem repeat
analysis. HPS-19I prostate fibroblast cells were obtained
from Dr. David Rowley (Baylor College of Medicine) and
were recently analyzed by spectral karyotyping. These
cells were maintained in DMEM with 5% FBS, 5% NuSerum (Gemini), 5 µg/ml insulin, 0.5 µg/ml testosterone,
25 µg/ml penicillin-streptomycin. 3T3-J2 (J2) embryonic
mouse fibroblasts were obtained from Dr. Jason Bodily
and grown in DMEM with 10% bovine serum (not fetal).
All cells were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Cells were seeded at 106 cells per 10 cm dish and
were allowed to grow to 80% confluency in complete

(BD Biosciences).  Each well of a 24-well plate was
covered with 300 μl of the matrix/cell suspension and
allowed to polymerize for 1 hour at 37°C.  After 1 hour,
the matrix was hydrated with 500 μl complete media at
37°C overnight.  The gels were detached from the sides
of the tissue culture plastic with a spatula, treated with or
without 5 ng/ml TGF-β ± digoxin, and allowed to contract
for 4 days.  The wells were treated with fresh media and
treatments on day 2 post seeding.  Images were analyzed
using ImageJ software to determine gel area relative to the
well.  The assays were performed three times in duplicate.
