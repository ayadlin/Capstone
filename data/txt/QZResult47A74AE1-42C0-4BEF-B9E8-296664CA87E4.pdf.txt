ABSTRACT
Medulloblastoma is comprised of at least four molecular subgroups with distinct
clinical outcome (WHO classification 2016). SHH-TP53-mutated as well as MYCamplified Non-WNT/Non-SHH medulloblastoma show the worst prognosis.
Here we present evidence that single application of the multi-kinase inhibitor
Vandetanib displays anti-neoplastic efficacy against cell lines derived from high-risk
SHH-TP53-mutated and MYC-amplified Non-WNT/Non-SHH medulloblastoma. The
narrow target spectrum of Vandetanib along with a favourable toxicity profile renders
this drug ideal for multimodal treatment approaches. In this context our investigation
documents that Vandetanib in combination with the clinically available PI3K inhibitor
GDC-0941 leads to enhanced cytotoxicity against MYC-amplified and SHH-TP53-mutated
medulloblastoma. In line with these findings we show for MYC-amplified medulloblastoma
a profound reduction in activity of the oncogenes STAT3 and AKT. Furthermore, we
document that Vandetanib and the standard chemotherapeutic Etoposide display additive
anti-neoplastic efficacy in the investigated medulloblastoma cell lines that could be
further enhanced by PI3K inhibition. Of note, the combination of Vandetanib, GDC-0941
and Etoposide results in MYC-amplified and SHH-TP53-mutated cell lines in complete loss
of cell viability. Our findings therefore provide a rational to further evaluate Vandetanib
in combination with PI3K inhibitors as well as standard chemotherapeutics in vivo for
the treatment of most aggressive medulloblastoma variants.

system and good tolerability of Vandetanib in single use
or in combination with radio- and chemotherapy [3–5].
Against this background our study evaluates the potency
of Vandetanib for medulloblastoma treatment, the most
common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Numerous
molecular studies document that medulloblastoma is not
one disease but composed of molecular distinct subgroups
[6]. Overall survival for patients suffering from SHHTP53 mutated and MYC-amplified Non-WNT/Non-SHH
medulloblastoma subtypes is poor with the highest risk of
recurrence and death within this patient cohort [7, 8]

INTRODUCTION
Angiogenesis is critical for tumor growth and
metastasis, therefore receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
targeting tumor blood vessel formation by VEGFR
inhibition increasingly gain access to multimodal
therapeutic approaches against brain tumors [1, 2]. Recent
clinical studies in adult and pediatric patients suffering
from glioblastoma multiforme and diffuse pontine glioma
document anti-neoplastic activity within the central nervous

The efficacy of Vandetanib has been suggested to rely
not solely on inhibition of angiogenesis but also on direct
attenuation of tumor growth by blockade of its target receptors
namely vascular, endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and 3,
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-RET expressed
on the cancer cells themselves. [9–11]. VEGFR-2 and EGFR
receptors have recently been identified as medulloblastoma
oncogenes with EGFR gene amplification and overexpression
being a marker of poor prognosis [12–16]. We hypothesize
that the most aggressively growing medulloblastoma variants
characterized by dependency on tumor-angiogenesis and
expression of receptor tyrosine kinases represent an attractive
target for Vandetanib therapy. However, despite the successful
incorporation of Vandetanib into treatment regimes for adult
malignancies, assessment of efficacy in pediatric tumor entities
is sparse with no preclinical or clinical studies analyzing its use
for medulloblastoma treatment yet [17, 18].
Here we present first evidence that Vandetanib has
profound cytotoxic activity in pediatric medulloblastoma
cell lines derived from high-risk SHH-TP53-mutated and
MYC-amplified Non-WNT/Non-SHH medulloblastoma
[19–25]. In keeping with the observed anti-neoplastic
capacity we demonstrate that Vandetanib treatment
attenuates AKT and STAT3 activity, downstream elements
of aberrant signaling pathways in medulloblastoma [26–30].
In our latest study we already documented promising
in vitro and in vivo potential for the clinically available PI3K
inhibitor GDC-0941 for medulloblastoma therapy [31]. In
this follow-up study we show that specifically inhibiting
oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases in combination with
downstream elements such as PI3K on which multiple

carcinogenic pathways converge might be a rational
treatment strategy for aggressive medulloblastoma variants.
In this context we observed that the concomitant application
of Vandetanib and GDC-0941 resulted in augmented
cytotoxicity for MYC-amplified and SHH-TP53-mutated
medulloblastoma. In MYC-amplified medulloblastoma we
also detected a corresponding reduction of AKT and STAT3
phosphorylation and protein levels compared to single drug
treatment. Furthermore, we document that concomitant
application of Vandetanib and the standard chemotherapeutic
Etoposide leads to enhanced cytotoxicity in comparison
to single drug application. Additional inhibition of the
PI3K by GDC-0941 further augmented this marked antineoplastic efficacy of the Vandetanib-Etoposide combination
with de facto no surviving cells in MYC-amplified and
SHH-TP53-mutated medulloblastoma. Thus, therapeutic
approaches based on inhibition of oncogenic kinases alone
or in combination with standard chemotherapeutics might
constitute a promising treatment option for medulloblastoma
variants with poor clinical outcome to date.

RESULTS
In medulloblastoma Vandetanib reduces cell
viability in a dose-dependent manner
In a dose-response analysis we evaluated the anticarcinogenic potency of Vandetanib in Daoy, a cell line
modeling SHH-TP53-mutated medulloblastoma, and in the
MYC-amplified Non-WNT/Non-SHH medulloblastoma
derived cell lines MEB-Med8-A, D283 Med and D341

Figure 1: Vandetanib treatment leads to a dose-dependent reduction of medulloblastoma cell viability. The cell lines

MEB-Med-8A, D283 Med, Daoy and D341 Med were treated with increasing concentrations of vandetanib. The vehicle DMSO served
as control. After 48h of drug exposure the cell viability was assessed by means of the MTS assay. Statistically significant differences from
DMSO are marked by an asterisk (*p<0.05), the data shown represent four independent experiments.

Med, (Figure 1). At standard growth conditions the cells
were treated with Vandetanib concentrations ranging from
1 to 10 µM for 48h. Subsequently the cell viability was
determined by MTS assays.
At 2 µM, a concentration corresponding to patient
plasma levels [5, 32], Vandetanib reduced cell viability in
Daoy by 15±9%, in MEB-Med-8A by 81±3%, in D283
Med by 44±6% and in D341 Med by 25±9% in comparison
to control. With regards to Vandetanib susceptibility, MEBMed-8A and D283 Med were of high responsiveness while
Daoy and D341 displayed lower sensitivity. A further
decline in cell viability could only be achieved when raising
the drug concentration to 10 µM. At this concentration we
observed a profound loss in cell viability across all analysed
cell lines with a minimum residual cell survival of 10-40%.

cells in Daoy by 35±16%, in MEB-Med-8A by 67±6%,
in D283 Med by 41±11% and in D341 Med by 27±9%
(Figure 2A). The CFSE-Hoechst33258 stain revealed that
this profound loss in absolute cell numbers over a 48h
period was predominantly due to the cytotoxic activity of
Vandetanib and complemented by a less pronounced antiproliferative effect (Figure 2B and 2C). At 48h, in Daoy,
MEB-Med-8A and D341, 13±2%, 24±4% and 4±1% of
dead cells were determined respectively. In D283 Med cell
death differed not significantly from control at the assessed
time point. With regards to proliferation in MEB-Med-8A
a marked reduction of proliferating cells by 21.5% was
observed at the 48h time point In contrast in Daoy, D283
Med and D341 Med proliferation in cells surviving after
48h of Vandtanib exposure was only marginally impaired.

exerts anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
effects in medulloblastoma cell lines

Vandetanib interferes with the clonogenicity
of medulloblastoma in a dose-dependent
manner

After 48h of Vandetanib treatment we determined
the absolute number of viable cells by flow cytometry
and assessed the relative contribution of cell death
and proliferation inhibition via combined CFSEHoechst33258 stain.
Exposing the cell lines to 2 µM of Vandetanib over
48h significantly decreased the absolute number of viable

In view of their differential group affiliation,
we chose Daoy and MEB-Med-8A to assess the effi­
cacy of Vandetanib to interfere with medulloblastoma
clonogenicity (Figure 3). Treatment of Daoy and MEBMed-8A with 1, 2 and 4 µM of Vandetanib resulted in a
dose-dependent reduction of colony numbers (CN) and
average colony size (ACS).

Figure 2: Vandetanib impairs cell viability in medulloblastoma. The established paediatric MB cell lines MEB-Med-8A, D283

Med, Daoy and D341 Med were treated with 2 µM of Vandetanib for 48h. The vehicle DMSO served as the control. In a combined flow
cytometric cell viability/proliferation assay based on a CFSE/Hoechst 33258 stain, viable cell number A. cell death B. and inhibition of
proliferation C. was assessed. All statistically significant differences from DMSO are marked by an asterisk (*p<0.05) (A-C). Inhibition of
proliferation was normalized to DMSO (C). The data shown represent four independent experiments.

At 2 µM, a concentration typically achieved
in patient plasma, MEB-Med-8A showed significant
reduction of colony numbers and colony size (CN: 9±0.5
and ACS: 305±250p2) in comparison to control (CN:
164±23 and ACS: 1028±29p2). At the same concentration
in Daoy we only documented a reduction in colony size
(1618±900p2) compared to control (3723±1000p2) but not
in colony numbers. Increasing the dose to 4 µM enhanced
the observed effects in both cell lines and additionally
resulted for Daoy in a profound decline in the number of
colonies (173±45) in comparison to control (300±35).

24 hours at 2 µM, Vandetanib inhibited cell migration
significantly (215±45 µm) in comparison to control
(365±36 µm). Escalating the dose to 4 µM did not lead
to a further impairment of the migratory capacity of Daoy
cells.

Vandetanib and the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941
display additive anti-neoplastic efficacy in
medulloblastoma
The PI3K/AKT pathway transduces signals of
oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases in medulloblastoma
[29, 30]. In this context we have previously shown in
in vitro and in vivo medulloblastoma models that single
application of GDC-0941 exerts profound anti-neoplastic
activity [31]. We therefore asked whether additional
blockade of the PI3K would enhance the cytotoxity of
Vandetanib. Here we exposed medulloblastoma cell
lines to 2 uM of Vandetinib in combination with 1 uM

Vandetanib attenuates medulloblastoma cell
migration
We also determined the potential of Vandetanib
to inhibit medulloblastoma cell migration at different
concentrations (Figure 4). The cell line Daoy was chosen
because of its known migratory properties. [33]. After

and 4 µM Vandetanib for 48h. Subsequently the cells were maintained in standard growth medium for 7 days and colony formation and
colony size were assessed. Statistically significant differences from control are marked by an asterisk (*p<0.05). The data shown represent
five independent experiments.

of the P3IK-antagonist GDC-0941 for 48h. Both drug
concentrations correspond to plasma levels found in
treated patients [32, 34]. Subsequently the number of
viable cell was determined by flow cytometry. In order to
differentially assess cell death in relation to proliferation,
we applied a CSFE-Hoechst33258 stain (Figure 5).
In the MYC-amplified cell lines the combination
of Vandetanib and GDC-0941 resulted in a significantly
enhanced reduction of viable cells by 97±1% in MEBMed-8A, by 78±5% in D283 Med and by 62±1% in D341
Med in comparison to Vandetanib alone with 67±6%,
41±11% and 27±9% and GDC-0941 alone with 81±2%,
53±5% and 29±7% of residual viable cells in MEB-Med8A, D283 Med and D341 Med respectively. In the SHHTP53-mutated cell line Daoy we detected on average less
residual cells for the drug combination in comparison
to single drug application. However, this trend was not
significant.
For the MYC-amplified cell lines MEB-Med-8A,
D283 Med and D341 Med but not the SHH-TP53-mutated
cell line Daoy concomitant exposure to Vandetanib and
GDC-0941 led to significantly enhanced cytotoxicity
compared to single drug treatment. At 48h after drug
treatment we document for the drug combination 84±5%
of dead cells in MEB-Med-8A, 32±4% in D283 Med
and 7±3% in D341 Med. In contrast Vandetanib single
application resulted only in 24±4% of cell death in MEBMed-8A, 14±2% in D283 Med and 4±1% in D341 Med. In
Daoy, D283 Med and D341 Med the effect of Vandetanib
single application with 13±2%, 14±2% and 4±1% of
dead cells was comparable to the application of GDC0941 alone with 9±4%, 14±5% and 3±1% of cell death
respectively. In MEB-Med-8A with 40±3% cell death 1
µM GDC-0941 displayed more efficacy compared to 2
µM of Vandetanib with 24±4% cell death.
Only in MEB-Med-8A we determined a markedly
enhanced inhibitory effect on proliferation with 39±4%
when Vandetanib was combined with GDC-0941 in
comparison to Vandetanib single treatment with 21±5%

inhibition of proliferation. In Daoy, D283 Med and D341
Med proliferation was only marginally decreased by single
application of Vandetanib or GDC-0941 at the assessed
time point.

Concomitant application of Vandetanib and
GDC-0941 leads to profound reduction of AKT
and STAT3 signaling in medulloblastoma
cell lines
Aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway
and transcription factor STAT3 is considered critical for
medulloblastoma carcinogenesis [26–31]. In keeping with
these findings the four investigated medulloblastoma cell
lines showed phosphorylation of serine 472 of AKT and
tyrosine 705 of STAT3 (Figure 6).
Here we document that in Daoy Vandetanib
treatment moderately decreased AKT phosphorylation
and protein expression, while in MEB-Med-8A, D283
Med and D341 Med AKT signaling was unaffected by
Vandetanib. With regards to STAT3 following treatment
with Vandetanib a concomitant decrease in STAT3
phosphorylation and expression was apparent for Daoy
and to a greater extent for MEB-Med8-A, but not D283
and D341.
Single treatment of GDC-0941 in Daoy, MEB-Med8A and D283 Med resulted in complete abrogation of AKT
phosphorylation and a marked reduction in AKT protein
levels, while in D341 Med residual AKT activity could be
detected. STAT3 phosphorylation and protein expression
was moderately decreased by GDC-0941 in Daoy, MEBMed-8A and D283 Med but not in D341 Med.
Application of the Vandetanib-GDC combination
enhanced the reduction of AKT phosphorylation and
expression only in D341 Med. In Daoy, MEB-Med-8A
and D283 Med the already profound suppression of GDC0941 single application on AKT signaling was not further
augmented by the drug combination. With respect to
STAT3 activity however, the drug combination resulted in

confluent monolayer of Daoy cells, cell were exposed to increasing concentrations of Vandetanib for 24h. After 24h each scratch was
photographed and its width measured. Migration was determined by comparison of the scratch wound size between 0h and 24h. Statistically
significant differences from control are marked by an asterisk (*p<0.05). The data shown represent five independent experiments.

a more pronounced reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation
and expression compared to single drug application in
MEB-Med-8A, D283 Med and D341 Med. In Daoy in
contrast, we could not observe any additional reduction in
STAT3 phosphorylation or expression for the combination
of Vandetanib and GDC-0941.

spinal fluid (1-2 µM) or patient plasma (10 µM) levels
results in enhanced anti-neoplastic efficacy [35, 36].
For this purpose we treated medulloblastoma cell lines
with Etoposide concentrations ranging from 0.1 – 10 µM
in combination with 2 µM of Vandetanib for 48h and
determined the cell viability by MTS assay (Figure 7).
In the SHH-TP53-mutated cell line Daoy and the
MYC-amplified cell lines D283 Med and D341 Med single
application of Etoposide at cerebral spinal fluid levels of
1 µM displayed anti-neoplastic efficacy with 30-60%
residual cell viability. In contrast MEB-Med-8A, which
also models MYC-amplified tumors, was resistant at 1 µM
of Etoposide and displayed only moderate susceptibility to
10 µM Etoposide corresponding to patient plasma levels
with 74±4% residual cell viability.

Concomittant application of Vandetanib, GDC0941 and Etoposide displays additive cytotoxic
activity in medulloblastoma
The topoisomerase inhibitor Etoposide is part of the
standard treatment regime for paediatric medulloblastoma.
We analysed whether concomitant application of Vandetanib
and Etoposide at concentrations corresponding to cerebral

We have previously show additive anti-neoplastic
efficacy for the concomitant application of Etoposide
and the PI3K-antagonist GDC-0941 in medulloblastoma
cell lines [31]. Here we corroborate these results and
document superior additive anti-neoplastic efficacy for
the Vandetanib-Etoposide combination in comparison to
single drug application. In the SHH-TP53-mutated cell
line Daoy the anti-neoplastic efficacy of the VandetanibEtoposide and GDC-Etoposide combination were similar.
In the MYC-amplified cell line D283 Med concomitant
application of GDC-0941 and Etoposide displayed superior
efficacy compared to concomitant application of Vandetanib
and Etoposide. On the opposite in the MYC-amplified cell
lines D341 Med and MEB-Med-8A we observed superior
efficacy for the Vandetanib-Etoposide combination in
comparison to the GDC-Etoposide combination. Of
note, in MEB-Med-8A the anti-neoplastic efficacy was
predominantly due to kinase inhibitor treatment.
With regards to concomitant application of
Vandetanib and GDC-0941 in the SHH-TP53-mutated
cell line Daoy we determined in our previous experiments
a trend of higher anti-neoplastic efficacy in comparison
to single drug application. Here in a cumulative assay
determining anti-proliferative and cytotoxic drug effects
by means of the metabolic state of the residual cell
population this trend could be confirmed. Furthermore,
we posed the question, whether inhibition of receptor
tyrosine kinases and their downstream signaling molecules
could enhance medulloblastoma standard treatment
regimes. We treated the investigated cell lines therefore
concomitantly with Vandetanib and GDC-0941 in the
presence of the chemotherapeutic Etoposide. Indeed, in
the SHH-TP53-mutated cell line Daoy as well as in the
MYC-amplified cell lines D283 Med and D341 Med the
application of the Vandetanib-GDC-Etoposide combination
augmented the cytotoxic effect regardless of the applied
concentration of Etoposide in comparison to single or
dual drug application. In detail, in Daoy and D283 Med
at 1 and 5 µM of Etoposide respectively the concomitant
application of Vandetanib, GDC-0941 and Etoposide
resulted in complete loss of viable cells while in D341
Med at Etoposide concentrations of 1 and 5 µM residual
cell viability plateaued 13.6±6 and 15.3±4% respectively.
Applying higher Etoposide concentrations in combination
with the applied kinase inhibitors did not lead to further
enhancement of anti-neoplastic efficacy. In line with
above described Etoposide resistancy of MEB-Med-8A
concomitant application of Vandetanib and GDC-0941 was
sufficient to reduce cell viability completely.

MYC-amplification and occurrence of isochromosome 17
of the most aggressive group of tumors within the NonWNT/Non-SHH group of medulloblastoma [19–23]. In
contrast Daoy displays markers of a subentitiy of SHHgroup tumors that is characterized by mutation of tumor
suppressor gene p53 (SHH-TP53-mutated) [24, 25].
A most recent report documents that patients suffering
from SHH-TP53-mutated medulloblastoma also display
extremely poor survival rates [7, 8].
Our analysis details that Vandetanib treatment at
concentrations corresponding to patient plasma levels
leads to marked loss of viable cells in MYC-amplified
and SHH-TP53-mutated medulloblastoma cell lines.
In line with the observed anti-tumorigenic efficacy of
Vandetanib, transcriptional profiling revealed high mRNA
levels of the Vandetanib target structures VEGFR 2 and 3
across all investigated cell lines. In contrast expression of
EGFR was only present in Daoy (Supplementary Table 1).
Dissecting the observed cumulative anti-neoplastic effect
of Vandetanib reveals that the profound cytotoxic activity is
complemented by a lower capacity to inhibit proliferation
by arresting surviving medulloblastoma cells in G0/G1Phase of the cell cycle (Supplementary Figure 1). The
cytotoxic capacity of Vandetanib against medulloblastoma
is also reflected in attenuated clonogenicity with profound
reduction in colony number and size. Beyond cytotoxic
and anti-proliferative effects we demonstrate that in vitro
Vandetanib impairs migration of medulloblastoma cells, a
prerequisite for invasion and metastasis. At this point it is
noteworthy that inspite of the more narrow target-spectrum,
the MKI Vandetanib displays similar in vitro efficacy
against medulloblastoma as we have previously described
for the broad-spectrum MKI Sorafenib and Pazopanib that
inhibits amongst numerous other kinases also VEGFR 2
and 3 (Supplementary Table 2). In an orthotopic xenograft
modell of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma, Sorafenib
and Pazopanib suppressed tumor growth with significantly
prolonged survival [28]. This finding is in line with
clinical phase I/II trials that document tumor responses
of the VEGF antibody bevacizumab in combination with
standard chemotherapy in patients suffering from recurrent
medulloblastoma [37]. The current investigation therefore
corroborates pre-clinical and clinical reports delineating
a key role for VEGF signaling in medulloblastoma
development and progression that can be exploited
for therapy. As it may be inferred that the documented
cytotoxic in vitro effects for Vandetanib also translate into
anti-neoplastic efficacy in vivo as shown for the broadspectrum MKI Sorafenib and Pazopanib, this approach
warrants further evaluation [28].
In keeping with the anti-tumorigenic capacity
of Vandetanib, we observed a moderate reduction in
phosphorylation of the VEGFR 2/3 and EGFR downstream
signaling molecule STAT3 in Daoy and MEB-Med-8A.
These observations confirm previous investigations
delineating the importance of STAT3 pathway activation

DISCUSSION
In this study we report that Vandetanib exerts
anti-neoplastic activity against a panel of four pediatric
medulloblastoma cell lines. MEB-Med-8A, D283 Med
and D341 Med exhibit distinct characteristics such as

downstream of aberrant receptor tyrosine kinases signaling
for tumorigenesis in medulloblastoma [26–28]. In view of
the pronounced cytotoxic activity of Vandetanib in D283
Med and D341 Med, lack of concomitant downregulation
of STAT3 phosphorylation indicates that in these cell
lines other pathways e.g. mitogen-activated protein
kinase pathways as also shown for osteosarcoma might
be involved in the integration of oncogenic signals
transmitted by Vandetanib target structures [29, 38].
The narrow target profile of Vandetanib in
comparison to broad-spectrum anti-angiogenetic MKI such
as Pazopanib and Sorafenib results in better safety and
tolerability (Supplementary Table 2) [39–42]. This is of
particular interest since MKI-triggered side effects such as
suppression of haematopoiesis are critical when considering
administration of these drugs in combination with
chemotherapy, immunotherapy and other targeted agents.
At present only few combinations of broad-spectrum MKI
with other targeted agents have been reported feasible in
terms of safety [43–46]. Whether the more specific inhibitor
Vandetanib shows less toxicity when combined with other
targeted agents is momentarily under clinical investigation
in a phase I trial testing the tolerability and efficacy of
Vandetanib in combination with the PI3K/AKT pathway
antagonist Everolismus (NCT01582191) in pediatric
patients with advanced solid malignancies. Preliminary
reports of this phase I study describe good tolerability of
the drug combination and evidence of response in heavily
pre-treated pediatric patients suffering from sarcoma [47].
Aberrant PI3K/AKT signaling downstream of receptor
tyrosine kinases has also been shown critical for the
development and progression of medulloblastoma [29, 30].
In this context we documented previously that the clinically
available highly specific PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 displays
profound in vitro activity and prolonged the life of tumorbearing animals in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of
most aggressive MYC-amplified human medulloblastoma.
[31]. Therefore, we assessed whether additional inhibition of
the PI3K by GDC-0941 would further enhance the observed
anti-neoplastic effect of Vandetanib. Indeed, here we
document that Vandetanib in combination with GDC-0941
displays enhanced cytotoxicity against MYC-amplified and
SHH-TP53-mutated tumor modeling cell lines compared
to single drug application. In line with the enhanced antineoplastic effects of the Vandetanib-GDC-combination our
findings demonstrate in MYC-amplified medulloblastoma a
further reduction in AKT and STAT3 activity respectively in
comparison to single drug application. This loss in activity
was not solely due to inactivation of upstream kinases but
also to reduction of the respective protein levels. Absence
of AKT and STAT3 proteins would also counteract other
oncogenic kinase signaling via these pathways. In context
the SHH-TP53-mutated cell line Doay we did not detect
a difference in AKT and STAT3 protein levels for the
Vandetanib-GDC combination in comparison to single drug
application. However, since only one SHH-TP53-mutated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell line was investigated and Vandetanib alone diminished
besides STAT3 also AKT activity in the respective cell line,
this result should be regarded with caution. With respect to
the observed reduction in AKT activity might be of note
that the SHH-TP53-mutated cell line expresses not only
the Vandetanib target structures VEGFR 2 and 3 as the
MYC-amplified cell lines but also EGFR. In breast cancer
cell lines inhibition of VEGFR and PI3K signaling by the
multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib leads to a reduction of
MYC activity [48]. Whether Vandetanib or GDC-0941 also
exert anti-neoplastic efficacy by suppressing MYC activity
warrants further evaluation.
Given the recent publications on medulloblastoma
subgrouping, the next step with regards to therapy is
to adapt the existing treatment regimes for high risk
medulloblastoma variants [6, 8, 49]. In this context our
study documents besides anti-neoplastic efficacy of the
standard chemotherapeutic Etoposide in MYC-amplified
as well as SHH-TP53-mutated medulloblastoma cell lines
an additive anti-tumorigenic efficacy for the EtoposideVandetanib combination in comparison to single
drug application (Figure 7). Our previous publication
documented also additive efficacy against the same
panel of medulloblastoma cell lines for the concomitant
application of Etoposide and the PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 [31]. Here we corroborate these results and show that
the Vandetanib-Etoposide as well as the GDC-Etoposide
combination display similar efficacy in SHH-TP53mutated and MYC-amplified cell lines.
Of note compared to single or dual drug application,
concomitant application of all three drugs reduces residual
cell viability to negligible levels even at very low doses of
etoposide. This is of considerable interest since patients
undergoing medulloblastoma therapy often suffer from
neurological sequelae due to chemotherapeutic mediated
long-term side-effects [50]. Therefore incorporation of
targeted agents into standard treatment regimes could also
positively affect the life-quality of patients significant
reduction of applied chemotherapeutic dosage.
Of particular interest MEB-Med-8A, a cell line
refractory to both etoposide as well as cisplatin (data
not shown), was still highly sensitive to single treatment
with Vandetanib and GDC-0941 respectively. Moreover,
concomitant application of Vandetanib and GDC-0941
resulted in de facto complete loss of cell viability.
Whether this finding, although promising, can be
translated to refractory tumors therapy in patients needs
further evaluation.
The development of rational and personalized cancer
therapy depends on the identification of valid biomarkers.
Expression of target structures might serve as markers for
the integration of TKI such as Vandetanib into standard
treatment regimes of medulloblastoma. However, in other
cancers microRNA expression patters are discussed as
promising indicators of eligibility for patient treatment
with Vandetanib [51].

Cell viability assay

In general, our findings underscore the notion
that combined inhibition of specific oncogenic tyrosine
kinases together with important downstream signaling
nodes - such as the PI3K that integrates signals of
multiple oncogenic kinases - can enhance anti-neoplastic
efficacy in combination with standard medulloblastoma
chemotherapeutics.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Vandetanib,
a clinically available angiogenesis inhibitor, displays direct
anti-neoplastic activity against pediatric medulloblastoma
cell lines modeling the clinically most aggressive SHHTP53-mutated and MYC-amplified tumor variants.
Furthermore, our study documents that combined application
of Vandetanib and GDC-0941, a clinically available PI3K/
AKT pathway inhibitor, results in fortified anti-neoplastic
responses against SHH-TP53-mutated and MYC-amplified
medulloblastoma. Furthermore, we delineate that Vandetanib
in combination with the standard chemotherapeutic Etoposid
displays additive anti-neoplastic efficacy that can be further
enhanced by PI3K inhibition. Therefore, our findings
provide a rational to further investigate Vandetanib alone, in
combination with PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors and standard
chemotherapeutics for the treatment of medulloblastoma
variants that despite of intensive multi-modality treatment
are currently still associated with poor prognosis.

Cell viability was assessed with CellTiter 96 Aqueous
One Solution Cell proliferation Assay (Promega) that contains
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3- carboxymethoxyphenyl)2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS). To ensure a linear
growth curve over 48h for assessment of MKI-effects, each
well of 96-well plates was seeded with 2.5x103 Daoy, 6x103
MEB-Med-8A, 104 D283 Med and 104 D341 Med cells
respectively. After overnight culture in complete medium, the
cells were treated with 1, 2, 4 and 10 µM of Vandetanib alone
or in combination with 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 µM of etoposide
and 1 µM of GDC-0941. The vehicle Dimethylsulfoxid
(DMSO) served as control. After 48h of MKI treatment,
MTS was added according to the supplier’s protocol and the
absorbance was measured at 490 nm using an ELISA plate
reader (Victor2 Wallac, Perkin Elmer). Cell viability was
calculated in percent of control.

Combined proliferation and cell death assay
Medulloblastoma cells were stained with CFSE
according to the instructions of the supplier. Daoy, MEBMed-8A, D283 Med and D341 Med cells were seeded
in 6-well cell culture dishes in complete medium. After
overnight culture, the cells were treated with 2 µM of
Vandetanib for 48h. Thereafter floating and attached
cells were collected, resuspended in 200 µl, stained with
Hoechst33258 and analysed by flow cytometry. The
number of viable cells was assessed for 120 sec in same
volume and at constant speed. Proliferation was traced by
CFSE staining and normalized to the control DMSO, while
cell death was determined by Hoechst33258 staining.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and antibodies
Vandetanib and GDC-0941 were obtained from LC
Laboratories. The primary antibody pSTAT3 (TYR705,
D3A7), STAT3 (124H6), pAKT (Ser473), AKT (11E7)
and GAPDH (D18H11) were purchased from Cell
Signaling while secondary antibodies were purchased
from Dianova. Carboxyfluoreszein-Succinimidyl Ester
(CFSE) was purchased from Invitrogen, while Hoechst
33258 was provided by Sigma.

Cell migration assay
The in vitro scratch assay was performed as
described by Liang et al. [52]. Briefly, Daoy cells were
plated in 12-well cell culture dishes. The cells were
allowed to adhere and spread for 12h at 37 °C. The
confluent monolayer was scratched in a straight line with
a p200 pipette tip. The debris was removed and the cells
were then incubated with Vandetanib. The vehicle DMSO
served as control. After 24h of treatment, migration
of cells into the “wound” was photographed at 10x
magnification (Nikon Eclipse TiS inverted microscope
attached to a CCD monochrome camera DS 2M). The
distance of migration was analyzed by means of NISElements Imaging Software.

Cell culture
The human medulloblastoma cell lines, Daoy (HTB
186), D283 Med (HTB-185) and D341 Med (HTB-187)
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). The medulloblastoma cell line, MEB-Med-8A,
was generated by Prof. T. Pietsch. The medulloblastoma
cell lines Daoy, D283 Med and MEB-Med-8A were
maintained in complete medium, namely Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, PAA) with L-glutamine
supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (PAA), 1%
penicilline/streptomycine (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen). The medulloblastoma
cell line D341 Med was maintained in DMEM with
L-glutamine supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
1 % penicilline/streptomycine and 10 % Human Serum
(HS, PAA).

Immunoblotting analysis
A total protein concentration of 25 µg derived
from medulloblastoma cell lines was separated by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes
were blocked for 1h at RT in 1x Tris-buffered saline
46924

Oncotarget

containing 0.1% tween-20 (TBST) supplemented with
5% BSA. Thereafter, the membranes were incubated
with the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C and
subsequently with the respective secondary antibody for
1h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was detected
by chemiluminescence and quantified by means of a
ChemiDoc XRS Imaging System (Bio-Rad).

The cell lines Daoy (200 cells/well) and MEBMed-8A (1000 cells/well) were plated in six well cell
culture dishes. The cells were allowed to adhere and
spread properly for 12h at 37 °C. Thereafter the cells were
exposed to 1, 2 and 4 µM of Vandetanib. After 48h of
exposure the cells were washed with standard medium to
remove any trace of the inhibitor and cultured for another
week. Colony numbers, and colony size was assessed by
IMAGEJ. Particles smaller than 40 pixel2 were excluded
from the analysis since these represented stain artefacts,
cell detritus or non-proliferating single cells.
