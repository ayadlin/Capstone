ABSTRACT
Detection of circulating tumor DNA using droplet digital polymerase chain
reaction (ddPCR) is a highly-sensitive, minimally invasive alternative to serial biopsies
for assessment and management of cancer. We used ddPCR to assess the utility
of measuring plasma concentrations of common epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) mutations (L858R, exon 19 deletion, and T790M) in 57 non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs).
High baseline plasma EGFR mutation (pEGFRmut) concentrations were associated
with shorter progression-free survival (8.43 months) than low baseline pEGFRmut
(16.23 months; p = 0.0019). By contrast, there were no differences in tumor
shrinkage or overall survival between groups. During EGFR-TKI treatment, pEGFRmut
levels decreased to zero in 89.58% of patients. Twenty-five of the 27 patients who
progressed had basal pEGFRmut, and 18 also had circulating T790M. All 20 patients
with dramatic progression (according to a categorization system for EGFR-TKIs
failure) had basal pEGFRmut, and 13 had T790M mutation at progression. These
results support the use of ddPCR for analysis of plasma EGFR mutations for prediction
of PFS and to monitor clinical responses to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients.

EGFR testing. However, tumor samples may not always
be available or sufficient. Recently, circulating cell-free
DNA (cfDNA) has attracted great attention because it can
be easily obtained, and several technologies have been
developed for its detection [8–10].
Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR)
is a highly sensitive, quantitative analysis technology
to detect gene mutations. Here, DNA is first emulsified
with oil into thousands of droplets, each containing 0
or 1 DNA target molecules. Then, PCR amplification is
performed in each fluorescently labeled droplet, so that
droplets containing mutant or wild-type target DNA
emit different color signals. Using a flow cytometer, the
number of different color signals is read to calculate the
concentration of target alleles [11]. We have focused on
ddPCR for detecting EGFR mutations over several years.
First, we demonstrated that ddPCR assays could achieve

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most
common type of lung cancer and the leading cause of
cancer mortality worldwide [1]. Over the last decade,
first-generation epidermal growth factor receptortyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have been the
first treatment choice for NSCLC patients who harbored
TKI-sensitive EGFR mutations such as L858R (an amino
acid substitution at codon 858 in exon 21), and ex19del
(an in-frame deletion in exon19) [2–5]. In patients who
are resistant to first-generation EGFR-TKIs but harbor
the T790M mutation in exon 20 of the EGFR gene,
third-generation EGFR-TKIs have shown efficacy [6,
7]. Therefore, assessing the presence of EGFR gene
mutations is critical for treatment strategy decisions in
NSCLC. Tumor tissue is still the recommended source for

a detection sensitivity of 0.02% for mutant EGFR L858R,
ex19del, and T790M, using tumor cells and normal
human blood [12]. Second, we attempted to translate this
technology to clinical diagnosis, and demonstrated that
mutant plasma EGFR (pEGFR) concentration determined
by ddPCR analysis could achieve a concordance of
86.73% with tumor EGFR (tEGFR) status [13]. Our
previous data also revealed that high pEGFR mutation
(pEGFRmut) concentrations correlated with extensive
tumor burden [13]. Thus, albeit clinical validation is still
needed, the quantitation of pEGFRmut may have great
prognostic value for NSCLC. With the goal of developing
a robust biomarker assay to predict prognosis in patients
treated with EGFR-TKIs, we present here a ddPCR
quantitative analysis of EGFR mutations (L858R, ex19del,
and T790M) using cfDNA isolated from the plasma of 57
NSCLC patients.

significant differences were found in qualitative pEGFR
status or quantitative pEGFRmut concentrations between
patients with tumor-positive L858R and ex19del
mutations.

Association with progression-free survival,
overall survival, and tumor response
Median follow-up for the 57 patients was 12.27
months (range, 0.5-22.23 months). By the end of followup, 31 patients (54.39%) had progressed, as determined
by imaging and the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 guidelines. Median
progression-free survival (PFS) for high and low baseline
pEGFRmut concentration was 8.43 and 16.23 months
(p = 0.0019, Figure 1a), respectively. Patients with a
pEGFRmut concentration greater than the median—that is,
≥200copies/ml for L858R or ≥75copies/ml for ex19del—
were included in the high pEGFRmut group. The same
results were found when we analyzed L858R and ex19del
separately. Median PFS was 8.7 months for high L858R
patients, whereas median PFS for low L858R patients
was not reached (p = 0.0436). For high and low ex19del
patients, median PFS was 8.43 and 16.23 months (p =
0.0011), respectively (Figure 1b, 1c). In the multivariate
Cox regression model, pEGFRmut concentration,
smoking history, and brain metastasis were independently
associated with PFS, when adjusted for tumor burden, sex,

In clinical practice, most patients continue taking
the originally prescribed EGFR-TKIs, even after
progression is detected by imaging. Therefore, to guide
subsequent management, Jin-ji Yang et al. proposed a
series of clinical modes of EGFR-TKIs failure, classified
as dramatic progression, gradual progression, and local
progression. In their study, a switch to chemotherapeutic
regimens showed a modest survival benefit only when
progression was deemed dramatic. Dramatic progression
was defined as: 1) disease control lasting ≥3 months with
EGFR-TKI; 2) deterioration of any pre-existing or new
symptoms, including cough, hemoptysis, chest pain,
fever, dyspnea and metastatic lesion-related symptoms;
and 3) rapid progression of multiple measurable lesions
compared with the previous assessment, or at least 2 of
the following progressive involvement of non-measurable
lesions, including progression of pre-existing lesions;
progression due to new lesions in the thoracic cavity;
new lesions beyond the thoracic cavity; or new malignant
effusion [14]. By the end of follow-up, according to Jin-ji
Yang’s modes, 40.35% (23/57) of the patients in our study
showed dramatic progression. Among these, median PFS
was 11.4 months for those with high baseline pEGFRmut
concentration, whereas PFS for the low-pEGFRmut group
was not achieved (p = 0.0362, Figure 1d). No significant
differences were found when we analyzed L858R and
ex19del separately.
By the end of follow up, 29.82% (17/57) of the
patients had died. Median overall survival (OS) for high
and low pEGFRmut groups was 16.1 months and 17.33
months (p = 0.1763), respectively. Tumor response was
assessed in 49 patients. According to RECIST v1.1, in the
low-pEGFRmut group there were 19 patients with partial
response (PR), three with stable disease (SD), and one with
progressive disease (PD), while in the high-pEGFRmut
group 22 patients had PR, two had SD, and two had PD
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(p = 0.862). No significant difference in shrinkage of
measurable lesions was observed between the high and
low pEGFRmut groups, with mean best shrinkage from
baseline of 44.22 ± 6.57% in the high pEGFRmut group
and 40.16 ± 4.58% in the low pEGFRmut group (p =
0.6142; Figure 2).

Treatment monitoring values
Forty-eight patients were followed up with
pEGFRmut testing. ddPCR flow cytometry plots for two
typical patients are shown in Supplementary Figures
1 and 2. During EGFR-TKI therapies, mutant pEGFR
concentrations decreased to zero in 43 patients (89.58%).
The other five patients, in whom pEGFRmut remained
detectable during treatment, had significantly poorer
PFS and included two without response and three who
progressed in 4, 5, and 8 months. The concordance
between pEGFRmut testing and imaging examination at
follow-up during EGFR-TKI therapy is shown in Table
3. Of the 27 patients who progressed, 13 had detectable
levels of baseline pEGFRmut at least 2 months before
progression, nine had positive pEGFRmut at progression,
and three were positive 2 and 4 months after progression.
In two patients with gradual progression, no mutation was
detected at progression or after 2 and 4 months. All the
20 patients with dramatic progression that were followed
up had previous detectable pEGFRmut, and fifteen were
pEGFRmut positive at least 2 months before dramatic
progression. The other five were positive at dramatic
progression (Table 3).
Twenty patients had detectable pEGFR T790M
mutation during the follow-up period. Among these, 18
suffered progression and showed detectable levels of
L858R or ex19del at follow-up. Among these, T790M
was detected earlier than pEGFRmut in three patients,
concurrently with pEGFRmut in twelve patients, and after
pEGFRmut in the remaining three patients. Five of these
18 patients underwent re-biopsy at progression and were
found to have tEGFR T790M. Notably, we did not detect

of NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib also supported
our findings. Using the TaqMan assay, a qualitative
method, to detect EGFR mutations in plasma, it showed
that median OS was significantly shorter in patients with
both tumor and plasma L858R mutation (13.7 months)
than in tumor-only L858R-positive patients (27.7 months)
19]. However, in another study in which the consistency
between qualitatively detected pEGFR and tEGFR was
compared in NSCLC patients, the authors also reported the
objective response rate in 106 observed patients. Objective
response rate to the EGFR-TKI gefitinib was 76.9%
(95% CI, 65.4-85.5%) in patients with both pEGFR and
tEGFR mutations, and 59.5% (95% CI, 43.5-73.7%) in
tEGFR-positive but pEGFR-negative patients [20]. Since
tumor lysis has been postulated to be the main source of
ctDNA [21, 22], a possible explanation for these seemingly
discordant results is that pEGFRmut concentration reflects
EGFR mutation abundance in tumor tissues, which in turn
might entail higher sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs. If this is the
case, it is possible that higher pEGFRmut levels might, at
least in some patients, predict better response to EGFRTKIs [20].
However, as discussed below, additional factors
are likely to be at play. In agreement with earlier
studies [21, 22], including our own [13], we showed
that pEGFRmut concentration was indeed correlated
with tumor burden. Using ddPCR, a recent study found
that the overall incidence of TKI-naïve (pretreatment)
T790M mutation in tumor tissues was 79.9%, with a
frequency ranging from 0.009% to 26.9%. T790M was
detected more frequently in larger tumors [24]. Since the
point mutation T790M in the EGFR kinase domain is the

the T790M mutation in plasma from three patients with
dramatic progression who harbored tumor tissue T790M
mutation at progression.

DISCUSSION
Routine testing of EGFR gene mutations is a
fundamental step before selecting a treatment strategy
for NSCLC patients. For screening these and other
cancer-related mutations, liquid biopsy has attracted
much attention due to its minimally invasive nature. Our
previous data [13], as well as results reported in other
studies [15, 16], demonstrated that ddPCR is a useful
clinical diagnostic method for pEGFR detection, with a
concordance of 80-90% with tEGFR status. Moreover, in
addition to its high sensitivity, as a quantitative technology
ddPCR has the advantage of providing concentration
profiles of target alleles. Although several studies
addressed this issue, the clinical significance of estimating
pEGFRmut concentrations in NSCLC has not been
unequivocally established. In this study, we found that
higher baseline pEGFRmut levels were correlated with
poorer PFS. This result is in line with results from other
ddPCR studies showing an inverse correlation between
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and/or tumor-associated
transcripts and clinical outcome. For instance, in a study
of melanoma patients who received BRAF inhibitors,
low concentration of plasma BRAFV600E was significantly
associated with longer OS and PFS [17]. In a breast
cancer study, high serum miR-10b-5p levels were found
to be associated with clinical biological markers of poor
prognosis [18]. Subgroup analysis in the EURTAC trial

pretreatment levels of pEGFRmut. We suggest that
in clinical practice, dramatic progression criteria
assessment is much more important than imaging
criteria for progression, for in many circumstances, a
change in treatment strategies is advisable only when
progression is dramatic after failure of EGFR-TKIs
[14]. Considering the risk of radiation exposure and the
economic cost of imaging examinations, we propose
that serial plasma genotyping by ddPCR should be the
first screening test to guide treatment decisions, and
imaging should be used only after pEGFRmut status is
determined. Further studies are needed to determine the
feasibility of this proposed monitoring model.
In conclusion, we found that pretreatment
pEGFRmut concentration determined by ddPCR was
positively correlated with poorer PFS after EGFRTKI therapy. This assay also displayed a satisfactory
monitoring value during EGFR-TKI treatment.

major mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKI therapies,
it is conceivable that patients with higher pEGFRmut
concentrations progress at a faster rate because of
extensive tumor burden and potentially higher frequency
of pretreatment T790M mutation.
In our study, a significant difference in PFS, but
not in OS, was revealed in patients with low, compared
with high, pEGFRmut plasma levels. One possible
reason for the lack of difference in OS between groups
may be that 16 progressed patients received second-line
therapies, including 8 that were treated with AZD9291.
The efficacy of second-line therapies would reduce the
difference in OS between the two groups. In contrast, in
the melanoma and NSCLC (EURTAC) studies referred
above, patients who progressed after treatment with,
respectively, BRAFV600E inhibitors or erlotinib, did not
receive effective second-line therapies. In addition,
the short follow-up period may have precluded finding
significant differences in OS in our patients.
Several studies have assessed the value of liquid
biopsy in monitoring efficacy during treatments.
In a small sample study of pEGFRmut in NSCLC,
pEGFRmut concentration decreased to zero in most
patients [16]. In the aforementioned melanoma study,
cfBRAFV600E concentrations decreased significantly in
the first month of BRAF inhibitor therapy and at the
moment of best response [17]. Another NSCLC study
found a significantly shorter median PFS of 6.3 months
in patients with detectable pEGFR, compared with 10.1
months for those with undetectable pEGFR after twomonth EGFR-TKI treatment [15]. Similarly, our study
showed that pEGFRmut concentrations were reduced to
zero in 89.58% of patients, and these had a significantly
better PFS than those who retained detectable levels of
pEGFRmut. Also, although basal pEGFRmut was not
detected in some patients who progressed, all 20 patients
who showed dramatic progression had detectable

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and treatments
In our previous observational study, we
consecutively enrolled 113 previously untreated NSCLC
patients from October 2014 to May 2016, including 64
patients who harbored mutated tEGFR. Patients who
had other uncontrolled malignant tumors, uncontrolled
infection or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or severe
mental disease were excluded. Physicians and patients
made treatment decisions together, and 57 stage III/
IV patients with TKI-sensitive tEGFRmut received
EGFR-TKIs as first-line therapy. These 57 patients
were enrolled in this study, and undergo a follow-up
imaging examination every 2 months, if possible, with
a maximum interval of 3 months (Figure 3). All patients

time of imaging. 6-10 ml of whole venous blood were
collected into EDTA-containing vacutainers, stored at 4°C,
and centrifuged (10 min, 1800g at 4°C) within 6 hours
of collection. Plasma was frozen at -80°C until use. The
ddPCR workflow (as detailed in Supplementary Methods)
was conducted at WuXi AppTec Medical Testing Institute

PFS of patients treated with EGFR-TKIs was the
primary endpoint for assessing the relationship between
pEGFRmut concentration and prognosis. PFS was
defined as the time between the date of first EGFR-TKI
dose to the date of progression determined by imaging,
according to the RECIST v1.1 guidelines. Patients
were followed up until August 2016. Those who were
progression-free at the end of the study or lost to followup were censored. Secondary endpoints included OS,
tumor response rate, and best shrinkage of measurable
lesions. OS was defined as the time from the date of
first EGFR-TKI dose to the date of death. Patients who
survived until the end of the study or who were lost at
follow-up were censored. Best tumor response, such
as complete response, PR, SD, and PD, was assessed
according to RECIST v1.1. Measurable lesions were
measured as the sum of the longest diameters according
to RECIST v1.1, and the best shrinkage was the
maximum reduction percentage of measurable lesions
during treatment compared to baseline. Differences in
demographic and clinical characteristics between the
two groups were evaluated using the t test, rank sum
test, χ2 test, or Fisher’s exact test, with an alpha < 0.05.
PFS and OS curves were calculated using the KaplanMeier method and compared with the log-rank method,
with an alpha < 0.05. The multivariate Cox model to
estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI was also used
for comparison of PFS. Data were documented using
EpiData software (version 3.1, The EpiData Association,
Odense, Denmark) and analyzed using Stata software
(version 11.0, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
