Abstract

Author Manuscript

KRAS mutations are one of the most common driver mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and finding druggable target molecules to inhibit oncogenic KRAS signaling is a
significant challenge in NSCLC therapy. We recently identified epiregulin (EREG) as one of
several putative transcriptional targets of oncogenic KRAS signaling in both KRAS-mutant
NSCLC cells and immortalized bronchial epithelial cells expressing ectopic mutant KRAS. In the
current study, we found that EREG is overexpressed in NSCLCs harboring KRAS, BRAF or EGFR
mutations compared with NSCLCs with wild-type KRAS/BRAF/EGFR. Small interfering RNAs

(siRNAs) targeting mutant KRAS, but not an siRNA targeting wild-type KRAS, significantly
reduced EREG expression in KRAS-mutant and EREG-overexpressing NSCLC cell lines. In these
cell lines, EREG expression was downregulated by MEK and ERK inhibitors. Importantly, EREG
expression significantly correlated with KRAS expression or KRAS copy number in KRAS-mutant
NSCLC cell lines. Further expression analysis using 89 NSCLC specimens showed that EREG
was predominantly expressed in NSCLCs with pleural involvement, lymphatic permeation or
vascular invasion and in KRAS-mutant adenocarcinomas. In addition, multivariate analysis
revealed that EREG expression is an independent prognostic marker and EREG overexpression in
combination with KRAS mutations was associated with an unfavorable prognosis for lung
adenocarcinoma patients. In KRAS-mutant and EREG overexpressing NSCLC cells, siRNAmediated EREG silencing inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and induced
apoptosis. Our findings suggest that oncogenic KRAS-induced EREG overexpression contributes
to an aggressive phenotype and could be a promising therapeutic target in oncogenic KRASdriven NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.1 Lung cancer
comprises two major histological types: small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), and the latter represents 80–85% of all lung cancers.2 NSCLC is
further histologically classified into three major subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell
carcinoma and large cell carcinoma, and the most common subtype is adenocarcinoma.3 The
development of lung cancer involves a number of genetic and epigenetic alterations, many
of which may represent potential therapeutic targets.2 The proto-oncogene KRAS is one of
the most attractive therapeutic targets because KRAS mutations are frequently found in
NSCLC (especially in adenocarcinoma) and are associated with a poor prognosis for
NSCLC patients.2,4,5

Author Manuscript

KRAS encodes a small GTP-binding protein that sits at the hub of multiple signaling
cascades and is involved in many cellular processes, including cell proliferation and
apoptosis.6 Wild-type KRAS has intrinsic GTPase activity, which catalyzes the hydrolysis
of bound GTP to GDP, and KRAS mutations impair GTPase activity, thereby deregulating
several signaling pathways and downstream effectors in the GTP-bound form. Recently, we
identified epiregulin (EREG) as one of several putative transcriptional targets of oncogenic
KRAS signaling in both KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells and immortalized bronchial epithelial
cells expressing ectopic mutant KRAS.7 EREG is a member of the epidermal growth factor
(EGF) family and was originally purified from conditioned medium from mouse
tumorigenic fibroblast NIH/3T3 clones.8 EREG has broad receptor specificity; it stimulates
not only homodimers of EGFR and HER-4 but also all possible heterodimeric HER
complexes.9,10 EREG is expressed at relatively low levels in most adult normal tissues but is
highly expressed in various human cancers including colon, bladder, pancreatic, breast and

NSCLC.11–19 Although accumulating evidence indicates the possible involvement of EREG
in tumorigenesis, the oncogenic effects of high-level tumor-specific expression of EREG
and its relationship to KRAS in lung cancer remain unknown. Here, we describe that KRAS
mutations along with increased KRAS copy number induce EREG overexpression, which
contributes to an aggressive phenotype and an unfavorable prognosis in KRAS-mutant
NSCLC, suggesting that EREG could be a therapeutic target for oncogenic KRAS-driven
NSCLC.

RESULTS

Author Manuscript

We first examined EREG expression in a panel of NSCLC cell lines (12 KRAS-mutant, four
BRAF-mutants, nine EGFR-mutants and 10 lines with wild-type KRAS/BRAF/EGFR) by
quantitative RT–PCR analysis. There were significant differences in EREG expression
levels among these groups, and EREG was predominantly expressed in NSCLCs harboring
KRAS, BRAF or EGFR mutations (Figure 1a). In contrast, EREG expression levels were
extremely low in most small-cell lung cancer cell lines; EREG expression was undetectable
in 87% (20/23) of SCLCs (data not shown). We further tested whether elevated EREG
expression is oncogenic KRAS-dependent in NSCLC cells. In KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell
lines, in which EREG is most highly expressed (Figure 1a), small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) targeting mutant KRAS, but not an siRNA targeting wild-type KRAS,
significantly reduced EREG expression compared with the untreated controls (Figures 1b,
c). Thus, we confirmed our microarray results,7 showing that EREG is a transcriptional
target of oncogenic KRAS signaling in NSCLC cells.

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have suggested that activation of ERK mediates EREG upregulation.17,20,21
Therefore, to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of EREG expression in NSCLC cells
with KRAS mutations, KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells were treated with selective inhibitors of
MEK or ERK. In all cell lines, EREG expression was significantly downregulated by
inhibitors of MEK (U0126) or ERK (FR180204) (Figure 2). These findings strongly indicate
that EREG expression is upregulated through oncogenic KRAS-induced activation of the
RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway. In addition, in EREG-overexpressing NSCLC cells with wildtype KRAS, inhibition of MEK or ERK resulted in a decrease in EREG expression levels
(Supplementary Figure 1), indicating that the EGFR/RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway activation
is also essential for EREG upregulation in NSCLC cells with wild-type KRAS.

Author Manuscript

We observed a significant correlation between EREG and KRAS expression in a subgroup of
KRAS-mutant NSCLC lines but not in NSCLC lines without KRAS mutations (Figure 3a).
Previously, we demonstrated that KRAS copy number gains (CNGs) are associated with
increased mutant allele transcription and gene activity,22 and we confirmed that KRAS
expression significantly correlated with KRAS copy number in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell
lines (Figure 3b). We next analyzed the association between EREG expression and KRAS
copy number in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines. As expected, there was a significant
correlation between EREG expression and KRAS copy number in a subgroup of KRASmutant NSCLCs (Figure 3c). These results suggest that KRAS CNGs enhance oncogenic
KRAS-dependent activation of the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway, which in turn leads to EREG
overexpression in NSCLC cells. We also investigated whether EREG expression is

correlated with EGFR expression or EGFR copy number in NSCLC cell lines, as a previous
study reported that EREG expression is EGFR dependent.17 Although EGFR expression was
strongly correlated with EGFR copy number in both the whole group and an EGFR-mutant
subgroup (Supplementary Figure 2A), EREG expression was not significantly correlated
with EGFR expression or EGFR copy number (Supplementary Figures 2B, C); however,
this should be verified using a larger number of EGFR-mutant NSCLC samples.

Author Manuscript

We next examined EREG mRNA expression in surgical specimens from 89 NSCLC patients
by quantitative RT–PCR and analyzed the association between EREG expression and
clinicopathological parameters (Supplementary Table 1). First, we validated that the EREG
mRNA expression levels in lung adenocarcinoma tumors significantly correlated with
EREG protein expression levels, as evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis (Figures
4a–d, Supplementary Figure 3). Quantitative RT–PCR analysis revealed that EREG mRNA
expression was significantly higher in adenocarcinomas than in squamous cell carcinomas
(Figure 4e), whereas no significant differences in EREG mRNA levels were observed
according to gender, age, smoking status and pathological stages (data not shown). In
addition, EREG expression was significantly higher in tumor specimens with pleural
involvement, lymphatic permeation or vascular involvement than those without such
characteristics (Figure 4e).

In our series of NSCLC specimens, activating mutations in KRAS and EGFR were found in
19% (N = 17) and 38% (N = 34) of samples, respectively, and these mutations were found as
mutually exclusive events in adenocarcinomas. Conversely, no BRAF mutations were found
in the tumor specimens, which was not surprising, as BRAF mutations are rarely found in
NSCLC; the frequency of BRAF mutations in NSCLC tumors was found in previous studies
to be 1–4%.23,24 Because KRAS and EGFR mutations were restricted to adenocarcinomas,
we analyzed the association between EREG expression and mutational status of KRAS or
EGFR within a subgroup of adenocarcinomas to avoid a histological bias. There was a
significant difference in EREG expression levels depending on KRAS or EGFR mutational
status; EREG expression levels were higher in KRAS-mutant adenocarcinomas compared
with adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations or those with wild-type KRAS and EGFR
(Figure 4f). KRAS mutations have been associated with cigarette smoking in lung
adenocarcinomas;5 therefore, we compared the EREG expression levels among four groups
of adenocarcinomas classified according to KRAS mutation status and smoking history. In
both smokers and nonsmokers, EREG expression levels were higher in KRAS-mutant
adenocarcinomas (Figure 4g). These results indicate that EREG is predominantly expressed
in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas; although, it should be noted that EREG was highly
expressed in some NSCLCs with EGFR mutations or wild-type KRAS/EGFR.
We next evaluated the prognostic significance of EREG expression in lung
adenocarcinomas. Lung adenocarcinoma patients with high EREG expression levels tended
to have shorter overall survival compared with those with low EREG expression levels
(Figure 5a). When lung adenocarcinoma patients were divided into four groups according to
EREG expression levels and KRAS mutation status, the overall survival for lung
adenocarcinoma patients with EREG-high/KRAS-mutant tumors was significantly shorter
than those with EREG-low/KRAS-wild-type tumors (Figure 5b). Survival analysis was also

performed in an adenocarcinoma cohort that had not received EGFR-TKI therapy to exclude
selection bias of EGFR-TKI use. We observed shorter overall survival for the patients with
high EREG expression compared with those with low EREG expression (Supplementary
Figure 4A) and for the patients with EREG-high/KRAS-mutant compared with those with
EREG-low/KRAS-wild-type (Supplementary Figure 4B). Furthermore, EREG expression
was a significant prognostic marker by univariate and multivariate analyses adjusted for
pathology, stage and KRAS mutation status (Supplementary Table 3). In an adenocarcinoma
cohort, EREG expression still remained as a significant prognostic marker by univariate and
multivariate analyses when adjusted for stage and KRAS mutation status (Supplementary
Table 4). It is thus likely that EREG overexpression is associated with an unfavorable
outcome, especially for KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients; although, further
investigation with a larger number of patients is needed to verify the prognostic role of
EREG expression.

Finally, to assess the functional role of EREG in tumor growth of KRAS-mutant NSCLC
cells, we examined the effects of siRNA-mediated silencing of EREG expression on in vitro
tumor growth in the H358 cell line whose EREG expression level is highest among the
KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines. EREG siRNAs successfully reduced the EREG expression
in H358 cells (Figure 6a, Supplementary Figure 5), leading to significant inhibition of cell
proliferation (Figure 6b) and colony formation in liquid culture (Figure 6c), and of colony
formation on soft agar (Figure 6d). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated EREG silencing
significantly induced apoptosis as evaluated by annexin-V-fluorescein staining assays
(Figures 6e, f) and histone-DNA fragmentation ELISA assays (Figure 6g). These results
indicate that EREG is required for anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth and
survival in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells, suggesting that EREG could be a therapeutic target
for NSCLC with KRAS mutations.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

In the present study, EREG is overexpressed predominantly in NSCLC cell lines and
surgical NSCLC specimens that harbor KRAS mutations. In addition, we confirmed that
siRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant KRAS resulted in a significant reduction of EREG
expression in KRAS-mutant and EREG-overexpressing NSCLC cells. Our observations were
supported by previous studies using other types of human cancer cells with KRAS mutations
and experimental mouse models. Using a PCR-based complementary DNA (cDNA)
subtraction library to isolate genes that were differentially expressed between KRAS-mutant
HCT116 colon cancer cells and their KRAS-disrupted clones, Baba et al.25 identified EREG
as a gene upregulated by oncogenic KRAS and demonstrated that the in vivo tumorigenicity
in the KRAS-disrupted clones was partially recovered by forced expression of exogenous
EREG. Elevated EREG expression was also observed in KRAS-transformed prostate
epithelial cells21 and lung tumors from mice carrying oncogenic KRAS alleles.15,26
Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that activating KRAS mutations induce EREG
overexpression, which potentially confers oncogenic KRAS-mediated lung tumorigenesis.
The regulatory mechanism of EREG expression by oncogenic KRAS was described in a
previous study showing that constitutive activation of the MEK-ERK signaling pathway

induces EREG upregulation in KRAS-transformed prostate epithelial cells.21 Consistent
with that result, we found that inhibition of MEK or ERK leads to a significant decrease in
EREG expression in NSCLC cell lines that harbor KRAS mutations and overexpress EREG.
In addition to the present findings, we have previously shown that knockdown of mutant
KRAS reduced the levels of phosphorylated MEK and phosphorylated ERK.7 It is thus
plausible that the oncogenic activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway has a central
role in the regulation of EREG expression in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells.

Author Manuscript

We found that EREG is overexpressed in several NSCLC cell lines harboring EGFR
mutations. A previous study reported that EREG upregulation induced by compressive stress
was inhibited by an EGFR-TKI in human bronchial epithelial cells.27 Other studies have
reported that EREG is overexpressed in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines, including the
HCC827 cell line.15,17 In these studies, treatment with the EGFR-TKI gefitinib reduced
EREG expression in HCC827 cells17 and in mouse lung tumors.15 More recently, Regales et
al.28 identified EREG as one of the most highly expressed genes in the lung tumors of
mutant EGFR transgenic mice. Consistent with these findings, EREG expression was
downregulated by EGFR siRNA or EGFR TKIs in HCC827 cells in our preliminary study
(Supplementary Figures 6A–C). Taken together, it is likely that EREG expression is
dependent on oncogenic EGFR activation in NSCLC cells.

Author Manuscript

In contrast with the EREG expression data in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines, EREG levels
appear to be relatively low in EGFR-mutant NSCLC specimens (Figure 4f). Given that most
of the NSCLC cell lines we used were established from advanced NSCLCs with metastasis
and came from the metastatic lesions,29,30 higher EREG expression in the cell-line data may
reflect more aggressive tumor phenotypes of EGFR-mutant NSCLC. In fact, EGFR-mutant
NSCLC specimens with the pathological features of aggressiveness tended to express high
levels of EREG and EREG levels in the EGFR-mutant tumors with either pleural
involvement, lymphatic permeation or vascular involvement were significantly higher than
those without such characteristics (Supplementary Figure 7). Therefore, EREG
overexpression may be required for the acquisition of aggressive phenotypes during tumor
progression of EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

Author Manuscript

Our study also showed that BRAF-mutant NSCLC cell lines overexpress EREG and that
attenuation of BRAF activity led to a decrease in EREG expression in BRAF-mutant NSCLC
cells (Supplementary Figures 6D–F). Considering that BRAF is a direct downstream
mediator of KRAS, it is likely that oncogenic activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
pathway can induce EREG overexpression in NSCLC cells. Although further studies will be
needed to clarify the roles of EGFR and BRAF mutations as positive regulators of EREG
expression, oncogenic activation of EGFR/RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling may lead to
constitutive, high-level expression of EREG in NSCLC.
EREG serves as a pan-EGFR ligand with a broader specificity than other EGF-like ligands
and is a more potent mitogen than EGF.9,10 EREG promoted ERK-MAPK activation more
effectively than EGF or TGF-α,31 suggesting a possible involvement of EREG in tumor
progression. Indeed, there are several reports describing the oncogenic function of EREG.
EREG promoted cell proliferation in hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts32 and cancer cells of

the pancreas12 and bladder,18 whereas attenuation of EREG activity impaired in vitro tumor
growth in hepatoma cells33 and EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells.17 Consistent with these
findings, we found that siRNA-mediated EREG silencing inhibited anchorage-dependent
and -independent tumor growth, suggesting that EREG expression is required for NSCLC
tumor growth.

Our clinicopathological analysis of NSCLC surgical specimens revealed that elevated EREG
expression was associated with the pathological features of aggressiveness and was an
independent prognostic marker for lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, lung
adenocarcinoma patients with tumors with high EREG levels/KRAS mutations had worse
prognoses compared with those with low EREG levels/wild-type KRAS. Previous studies
using biopsy specimens showed that EREG expression correlated with advanced stage in
bladder cancer and lymph node metastasis in NSCLC and was suggested to be an
unfavorable prognostic marker for these cancers.13,17 These observations imply that EREG
is essential for tumor invasion and metastasis, thus contributing to the high-malignant
potential of NSCLC. This idea is supported by previous experimental studies. In a gene
expression profiling of bladder cell lines in a lung metastasis mouse model and human
primary bladder tumors, EREG was one of the overexpressed genes related to metastatic
progression.14 In another experimental mouse model using human breast cancer cells,
EREG promoted tumor growth, angiogenesis and lung metastasis in cooperation with
COX2, MMP1 and MMP2.34 Moreover, EREG promoted in vitro migration and invasion
through the activation of ERK and Akt in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cells.35
Notably, we found that EREG expression significantly correlated with KRAS copy number
in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines. Given that CNGs of oncogenes are thought to be later
events associated with the metastatic phenotype,36 it is likely that EREG overexpression is a
later event involved in the KRAS CNG-related metastatic phenotypes in NSCLC.
Interestingly, EREG expression was significantly correlated with EGFR copy number in a
subgroup of NSCLC cell lines with wild-type EGFR/KRAS/BRAF (Supplementary Figure
2C). It is thus possible that EREG overexpression in NSCLCs with wild-type EGFR/KRAS/
BRAF may be because of increased EGFR copy number. Conversely, in a subgroup of
EGFR-mutant NSCLCs, EREG expression was not correlated with EGFR expression or
EGFR copy number, suggesting that EREG overexpression in EGFR-mutated NSCLC may
not depend on EGFR expression status or EGFR copy number. Further investigation using a
larger sample size will be needed to address these issues.

Author Manuscript

Activating mutations in KRAS or EGFR are major genetic alterations in NSCLC, and
detection of these mutations in tumors has clinical implications for EGFR-TKI therapy.2
Clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC benefit from
EGFR-TKI therapy,37,38 whereas KRAS mutations appear to be associated with EGFR-TKI
resistance.39–41 Although BRAF mutations are relatively rare in NSCLC,23,24 detection of
BRAF mutations would also be clinically meaningful considering the possible application of
BRAF-targeted inhibitors to patients with BRAF-mutant NSCLC. Recently, Kris et al.42
analyzed 10 driver mutations in 1000 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, demonstrating that
the frequencies of mutations in KRAS, EGFR and BRAF were 22%, 17% and 2%,
respectively, with mutually exclusive patterns. This implies that >40% of lung

adenocarcinomas potentially harbor mutations of KRAS, EGFR or BRAF, all of which may
cause deregulation of the EGFR/RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway and upregulate EREG.
Considering that mutations in KRAS or BRAF appear to confer intrinsic resistance to EGFRTKIs39–41 and that most EGFR-mutated NSCLC eventually acquire resistance to EGFRTKIs,43 EREG might be an attractive therapeutic target for the majority of NSCLC tumors.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that EREG has essential roles in the acquisition of
aggressive phenotypes and is a promising therapeutic target in oncogenic KRAS-driven
NSCLC. Given that EGFR, BRAF and KRAS function in the same pathway, EREG might
also be a good target for BRAF-mutated or EGFR-mutated NSCLC, as it could expand the
population treatable by an EREG-targeted therapy. It should also be noted that other
unknown mechanisms might be involved in EREG overexpression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents

Author Manuscript

Thirty-five NSCLC cell lines and five noncancerous human bronchial epithelial cell lines
were used in this study (Supplementary Table 2). NHBE and SAEC cells were obtained
from Clonetics (San Diego, CA, USA), and BEAS-2B cells were obtained from ATCC. All
other cell lines were obtained from the Hamon Center collection (University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA). Information on the mutational status of
KRAS, BRAF and EGFR and the gene copy number of EGFR and KRAS in the cancer cell
lines is described in previous studies from our group22,23,29,41 and in the COSMIC database
of the Sanger Institute (http://www.sanger.ac.uk). The cancer cells were cultured with RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. The human bronchial epithelial
cell lines were cultured with Keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) medium
with 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen) and 5 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen). All cell
lines were DNA fingerprinted for provenance using the PowerPlex 1.2 kit (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA), which was confirmed to be the same as the DNA fingerprint library
maintained either by ATCC or by the Minna/Gazdar lab (which is the primary source of the
lines). The lines were also confirmed to be free of mycoplasma using the e-Myco kit (Boca
Scientific, Boca Raton, FL, USA). The reagents gefitinib (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX,
USA), erlotinib (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc., North York, ON, Canada), SB590885
(Symansis, Shanghai, China), U0126 (Promega) and FR180204 (Calbiochem, San Diego,
CA, USA) were purchased from commercial suppliers.
Tumor specimens from NSCLC patients

Author Manuscript

The tumor specimens were obtained from 89 consecutive patients with primary NSCLC
cancer who underwent surgery between July 2003 and May 2008 at the Gunma University
School of Medicine Hospital (Supplementary Table 1). The tumors were histologically
classified according to the criteria of the World Health Organization. The postsurgical
pathological stage was classified according to the tumor–node–metastasis classification.
Nine adenocarcinoma patients have received gefitinib and six patients achieved partial
response. Noncancerous lung specimens (N = 9) obtained from nine patients were used as
normal controls for tumor specimens. The study protocol was approved by the institutional

frozen immediately after collection and stored at −80 °C, until the extraction of genomic
DNA or total RNA was performed.
Gene mutational analyses
The mutations in KRAS at codon 12 or in EGFR in exons 19 and 21 were analyzed using the
Smart Amplification Process Version 2 assay (DNA-FORM, Kanagawa, Japan), followed by
direct sequencing for confirmation.44 BRAF mutational analysis was performed, as
previously described.23 The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR
Purification kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) and were sequenced in both directions using
the ABI PRISM 3100 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan).
Quantitative RT–PCR

Author Manuscript

The expression levels of EREG, KRAS, BRAF and EGFR mRNA were determined by realtime RT–PCR.45 Taqman probe and primer sets for EREG, KRAS, BRAF and EGFR were
purchased from Applied Biosystems. The total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini
kit (QIAGEN), and the complementary DNA was synthesized using 2 μg of total RNA with
the SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis using the oligo (dT) primer system (Invitrogen).
Real-time PCR was performed using a Lightcycler 480 system (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo,
Japan). For quantitative analysis, the TBP gene was used as an internal reference gene to
normalize input complementary DNA. The comparative Ct method was used to compute
relative expression values.

siRNAs targeting wild-type KRAS or mutant KRAS were designed and purchased from
Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). The siRNA sequences are as follows: 5′GUUGGAGCUUGUGGCGUAGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′CUACGCCACAAGCUCCAACTT-3′ (antisense) for the KRAS G12C mutation; 5′GUUGGAGCUGUUGGCGUAGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′CUACGCCAACAGCUCCAACTT-3′ (antisense) for the KRAS G12V mutation; 5′GUUGGAGCUGGUGGCGUAGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′CUACGCCACCAGCUCCAACTT-3′ (antisense) for wild-type KRAS. The siRNAs against
EREG (siEREG-1 and siEREG-2), BRAF (siBRAF-1 and siBRAF-2) and EGFR (siEGFR-1
and siEGFR-2) were obtained from the siGENOME library (Dharmacon). An siRNA against
Tax was used as a negative control, as previously described.46 The cells were transfected
with 30 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 h, the cells were harvested to verify
target gene silencing.
RT–PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis
To detect the transcripts of wild-type KRAS or mutant KRAS, the PCR-RFLP method was
performed. Detailed methods are described in our previous study.7 For the wild-type
transcript, digestion of the 186-bp PCR product produced 156- and 30-bp fragments while
the PCR product remained as a 186-bp fragment for the mutant transcripts.

Gene copy number analysis

Author Manuscript

KRAS and EGFR copy numbers were determined by real-time quantitative PCR assay as
described.22 LINE-1 was used as a reference gene for all copy number analyses. Gene
dosage of each target and reference gene was calculated using the standard curve method.
Relative copy number of each sample was determined by comparing the ratio of target gene
to LINE-1 in each sample with the ratio of these genes in normal human genomic DNA,
made from a mixture of human blood cells from six to eight different donors, as a diploid
control. CNG in cell lines was defined as values >4.
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemical staining was performed according to the procedure described in a
previous study.47 A goat polyclonal antibody against EREG (1:40 dilution) was purchased
from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). The EREG expression was considered
positive only if nuclear or cytoplasmic staining was present. The staining intensity was
scored as follows: 1, <10% of tumor area stained; 2, 10–25% stained; 3, 26–50% stained;
and 4, >50% stained. The tumors that had a score of more than 3 were defined as having
high expression. Immunofluorescent staining was performed using the Alexa Fluor 488 antigoat IgG (H + L) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) secondary antibody as described.46
MTT assay
Forty-eight hours after the transfection of siRNAs, 5000 viable cells (that were negative for
trypan blue staining) were replated and cultured in 96-well plates in replicates of six. After 3
days, cell growth was evaluated by the 3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol–2yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay as described.44

Colony-formation assay
Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection, the cells were harvested, and 1000 trypan bluenegative cells were replated for colony formation in liquid culture.46 Alternatively, 2000
siRNA-transfected cells were replated for soft-agar colony-formation assay as described.46
DNA fragment detection by ELISA
Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection, the cells were harvested, and 5000 trypan bluenegative cells were replated and cultured in 96-well plates in replicates of 6. After 48 h, the
transfected cells were assayed by the cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragment method
using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus Kit (Roche Diagnostics), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Apoptotic cell detection by annexin-V-fluorescein staining
Four days after siRNA transfection, the cells were double-stained using the Annexin V–
FLUOS kit (Roche Diagnostics) and Hoechst 33342 solution (Molecular Probes), according
to the manufacturers’ protocols. The stained cells were immediately viewed using a
fluorescence microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan; Model BZ-8100), and the cells positive
for annexin-V were considered apoptotic. The cells visualized by Hoechst staining were
counted in 12 randomly selected microscopic fields, and the percentage of apoptotic cells

was calculated by dividing the number of annexin-V-positive cells by the total number of
cells. The results were obtained from two independent experiments.
Statistical analyses
The data were statistically analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5 for Mac OS X (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate survival
as a function of time, and survival differences were analyzed by the log-rank test.
Multivariate analyses were performed with StatView version 5.0 software (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA) using stepwise Cox proportional hazards model to identify
independent prognostic factors. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

= 10), NSCLC cell lines harboring EGFR mutations (EGFR Mut; N = 9), BRAF mutations
(BRAF Mut; N = 4) or KRAS mutations (KRAS Mut; N = 12). Significant differences were
observed among all groups (P < 0.0001, Kruskal–Wallis test). The points represent the mean
EREG levels from four independent experiments. The lines represent the median levels in
each group. (b) The mutant KRAS transcripts and the wild-type KRAS transcripts were
specifically reduced by mutant KRAS siRNAs and a wild-type KRAS siRNA, respectively.
BstNI digestion produces a 156 bp DNA fragment (WT) in cells that have wild-type KRAS
alleles (for example, H1299 cells), whereas a 186 bp DNA fragment (Mut) remained uncut
in cells that have a mutant KRAS allele but no wild-type alleles. (c) siRNA-mediated EREG
silencing in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines, H1792, HCC4017, H441 and H358. For KRAS
mutant-specific knockdown, an siRNA against KRAS G12C mutant was used for H358,
HCC4017 and H1792, and an siRNA against KRAS G12V mutant was used for H441. NT,
