Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is usually chemoresistant. This
chemoresistance could be overcome if specific cytostatics are
applied for which the RCC expresses an uptake transporter.
In the present study, we investigated the expression of solute
carrier (SLC) transporters in different RCC lines and their
ability to interact with chemotherapeutics. We tested five RCC
lines for the expression of different SLCs by reverse transcription-PCR and TaqMan real-time PCR. In two of five RCC lines,
A498 and 7860, we observed a highly significant expression of
SLC22A3 (hOCT3). Uptake of the organic cation [3H]MPP
(4-methyl-pyridinium iodide) into these cells and also into
hOCT3 stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells
was inhibited by irinotecan, vincristine, and melphalan. The
K i values [determined from Dixon plots] for irinotecan,
vincristine, and melphalan were 1.72 F 0.45 Mmol/L, 17 F
4.81 Mmol/L, and 366 F 51 Mmol/L, respectively. Cytotoxic
activities of the selected drugs were tested by [3H]thymidine
incorporation and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays on CHO-hOCT3, A498 (high expression of hOCT3), and ACHN cell lines (low expression of
hOCT3). The growth of CHO-hOCT3 was inhibited by 20%
more with irinotecan and by 50% more with vincristine
compared with nontransfected CHO cells. Melphalan produced 20% to 30% more inhibition in hOCT3-expressing cells
compared with nonexpressing control cells. Similar results
were obtained for A498 and ACHN cells. Thus, our data
support the hypothesis that the sensitivity of tumor cells to
chemotherapeutic treatment depends on the expression of
transporter proteins mediating specific drug accumulation
into target cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(4):1494–501]

Introduction
Kidneys are important for the excretion of water soluble
xenobiotic compounds. Due to this function, tubule cells in the
kidney are exposed to high concentrations of carcinogens, which
can lead to tumor development (1). The incidence of renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) is 3% of all tumor malignancies. Every year,
31,500 new cases are registered in the United States, whereas 12,000
patients die from metastatic disease annually (2). Surgery at the

earliest stage has proven to be the most successful treatment
for renal cancer. However, this therapy is no longer helpful when
metastases have developed. From already diagnosed RCC, 50% of
patients have developed metastases. For this group, chemotherapy
would be a choice, but from the tested cytostatics only a few
showed some effect on RCC (2). Solid tumors are usually treated
by the antineoplastic drug cisplatin. The main dose-limiting side
effect of cisplatin is nephrotoxicity. The accumulation of cisplatin
in kidneys is higher than in other organs and is transporter
mediated (3).
The response to chemotherapy by tumor cells depends on the
concentration of cytostatics reached inside the cells. Cytostatic
drugs may permeate cell membranes by simple diffusion and by
influx and efflux transporter proteins. Efflux transporters are
represented by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family proteins and are
mainly connected with chemoresistence of cancer cells. Known
members of the ABC family are ABCB1 (MDR1), ABCC1 (MRP1),
ABCC2 (MRP2), and ABCG2 (BCRP; ref. 4). Efflux transporters can
interact with many cytostatics of different chemical structures. For
example, MDR1 interacts with daunorubicine, vincristine, etoposide, and cisplatin; MRP2 was shown to interact with cisplatin and
methotrexate (5). In the kidneys, MRP2 and BCRP are expressed at
the luminal side of proximal tubule cells and play important roles
in secretion of metabolites and xenobiotics (6). Influx transporters
belong to the solute carrier transporters (SLC). At present, there
are 47 SLC families, organized by alignment similarities and
substrate specificities. Many members of these families have a
similar tertiary structure consisting of 12 predicted transmembrane
domains. The energy for substance translocation can be obtained
from the electro-chemical gradient of Na+, H+, and organic ions
such as dicarboxylate, and the membrane potential (7). The SLC
transporter families are broadly expressed in the human body, with
specific localization of some transporters to epithelial barriers of
human body. Thereby, SLC transporters influence uptake, distribution and excretion of many drugs, including cytostatics.
Renal drug excretion in proximal tubules is mediated by a group
of broad specificity transporters belonging to the SLC22 family (8).
The organic anion transporters 1 and 3 (OAT1; SLC22A6; OAT3;
SLC22A8) take up a multitude of negatively charged pharmaceuticals from the blood into proximal tubule cells (7). The organic
cation transporter 2 and 3 (OCT2; SLC22A2; OCT3; SLC22A3) take
up positively charged compounds (9). Due to their broad
specificity, OATs and OCTs could transport cytotoxic drugs.
Indeed, transport of methotrexate has been shown for OAT1 and
OAT3 (10). OCT2, hMATE1, and hMATE2-K–mediated transport of
cisplatin (11–13) and transport of oxaloplatin by OCT2, OCT3,
hMATE1, and hMATE2-K was recently shown by Yonezawa and
colleagues (13).

hOCT3 and Impact on Chemosensitivity in RCC Lines

The expression of uptake transporters of the SLC family by
tumor cells would enable the accumulation of specific cytostatics
in these cells, rendering them chemosensitive. Because the majority
of RCCs originate from proximal tubule cells, we hypothesized that
carcinoma cells may retain some OAT and OCT expression. This
would allow for a tailored therapy with anionic or cationic
cytostatics.
The aim of this study was as follows: first, to determine the
expression of transporters belonging to SLC family in renal
carcinoma cells, second, to verify the functional characteristics of
the transporters in the tumor cells, third, to select the appropriate
cytostatics for the transporters, and, fourth, to show transportermediated cytostatic effects on renal carcinoma cells.

Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Renal carcinoma cells
were cultivated till 90% confluence and total RNA was obtained using the
SV Total RNA Isolation System kit. The concentration and quality of RNA
were measured using a Gene Quant II spectrophotometer (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA preparation from total RNA was performed
using MuLV reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed with
200 units of MuLV enzyme in a 20 AL reaction volume for 1 h at 37jC.
Diluted (1:3) 5 AL of the respective RT was used in a PCR reaction mix
containing the following: 5 AL 10 reaction buffer, 8 AL 1.25 mmol/L
deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 2 AL of 10 pmol solution of both primers,
and nuclease-free water to make up a reaction volume of 50 AL. The PCR
program (PCR cycler; Perkin-Elmer) was started with an initial denaturation
of 5 min at 96jC, 40 cycles for each transporter with 40 s at 96jC, 50 s
primer pair–specific annealing temperature, 1 min 72jC, followed by a
single 5 min cycle at 72jC for extension. After reaction, 10 AL of PCR
solution was mixed with loading buffer and loaded onto 1% agarose gel and
electrophoresis was performed (5 V/cm of agarose gel). After electrophoresis, the gel was visualized in a UV transilluminator. The obtained data
were analyzed by Gel Pro Analyzer (Media Cybernetics, Inc.).

Quantitative real-time PCR. For the real-time PCR, the reaction
mixture contained 12.5 AL of 2 reaction buffer, 1.25 AL 25 primer
mixture, 5 AL cDNA solution, and 6.25 AL nuclease-free water in a total
volume of 25 AL. The mixture was transferred into a 96-well plate, and
covered with an optical adhesive film. The plate was then transferred in
AbiPrism 7000 real-time PCR cycler (Applied Biosystems). The PCR program
consisted of the following steps: 2 min at 52jC uridine glycosylase step,
10 min at 96jC TaqMan polymerase activation step, 40 cycles: 15 s at 96jC,
1 min at 60jC. Fluorescence reading was performed on the last part of
each cycle. Obtained data were analyzed by the AbiPrism 7000 software.
Real-timeTaqMan primers (hGAPDH, Hs 99999905 m1; hHPRT, Hs
99999909 m1; and hOCT3 (SLC22A3), Hs 00222691 m1) and reagents were
purchased from Applied Biosystems.
Transport measurements. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably
expressing human OCT3, CHO-hOCT3, and RCC lines were harvested and
plated into 24-well plates (2  105 cells per well). After 72 h of incubation,
the cells were rinsed thrice with mammalian Ringer solution containing:
130 mmol/L NaCl, 4 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 1 mmol/L Mg2SO4,
1 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 20 mmol/L HEPES, and 20 mmol/L D-glucose, the pH
adjusted with 1 mol/L NaOH to 7.4. After washing, cells were incubated
at RT with 200 AL of transport solution containing 1 Amol/L [3H]MPP in
Mammalian Ringer. After 5 min incubation at RT, the cells were washed
with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 500 AL of 1 mol/L NaOH solution for
20 min. The lysed mixture was neutralized with 500 AL 1 mol/L HCl and
transferred into scintillation vials. Incorporated radioactivity was counted
by a scintillation counter (TriCarb 1500 Packard). For Dixon plot analysis,
data were calculated by SigmaPlot 10 (SPSS Science) multiple regression.
Proliferation assay. Proliferation was estimated by [3H]thymidine
incorporation as described previously (14). CHO-hOCT3 cells and RCC lines
were harvested and plated onto 24 well plates at a concentration of 5  105
cells per well. After 24 h cells were incubated for 30 min with different
concentrations of melphalan and washed thrice with the medium. Then the
cells were incubated in a medium containing 4 Amol/L of [3H]thymidine for
15 min. Thereafter, the cells were fixed with 5% trichloracetic acid for 30 min
on ice. The cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and once with
96% ethanol. Then, the pellets were dissolved in 1 mol/L NaOH for 20 min
and neutralized with 1 mol/L HCl. Incorporated radioactivity was counted
by a scintillation counter (TriCarb 1500 Packard).
Cell viability assay. CHO-hOCT3 and RCC lines were harvested and
seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of 1  104 cells per well. After
24 h, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of the
cytostatics and washed thrice with the medium. After 24 h, the medium
was exchanged with 50 AL of a medium containing 7.7 mg/mL of 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, tetrazole (MTT) and
incubated for 4 h. After the incubation, 150 AL of 2-propanol solution with
4% v/v 1 mol/L HCl were added to the medium. To dissolve the cell pellet,
the solution was mixed by pipetting. Optical absorption was measured by
Multiplate reader Mithras LB 940 (Berthold) and calculated with the help of
the formula (D = D620 nm D570 nm).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis and grafical layout were
performed with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft) and SigmaPlot 2001 (SPSS
Science).

Results
Expression evaluation of SLC family transporters in renal
carcinoma cell lines. To study the expression of SLC transporters,
we chose five renal carcinoma cell lines, A498, ACHN, 7860,
RCCNG1, and LN78. For testing transporter expression, we selected
the probably most important ones for drug uptake transporters,
such as hOAT1, hOCT3, hLAT1, hLAT2. Within the OAT family,
only OAT1 was expressed at a low mRNA level in all renal cell
lines. Neither OCT1 nor OCT2 showed a significant expression in
renal cancer cells (Fig. 1A), but OCT3 was present at high
expressing levels in A498, and 7860, and at a low level in LN78. In
ACHN and RCCNG1, hOCT3 was not detectable by RT-PCR.

difference between lowest expression (ACHN ) and other tested RCC lines.
Columns, mean calculated from three independent experiments with three
repeats each; bars, SD. C, expression of human MDR1, MRP2, MRP4, and
GAPDH in kidney carcinoma cell lines was determined by RT-PCR. The
quantification was made against GAPDH as reference from the same cDNA to
standardize and compare results. Neg. control, negative control.

As also shown in Fig. 1A, hLAT1 is present at high levels in all five
kidney carcinoma cell lines. The mRNA of hLAT2 is well-expressed
in the cancer cells 7860 and RCCNG1, but in ACHN and A498 cells,
the expression of hLAT2 was very low.
Using TaqMan real-time PCR, we found that A498 and 7860 RCC
lines have the highest OCT3 expression levels (12.5 and 6 cycles
difference compared with ACHN and RCCNG1 cells; Fig. 1B). An
intermediate expression level of hOCT3 was observed in LN78
(4–5 cycles differences with ACHN and RCCNG1 cells). Therefore,
for the next functional experiments, we selected A498 as highly
hOCT3-expressing cells and ACHN as a cell line with very low levels
of OCT3.
Expression of ABC family transporters in renal carcinoma
cell lines. The accumulation of cytostatics in the tumor cells
mediated by SLC transporters should depend on the activity and
expression of efflux transporters. Therefore, we studied the
expression of transporters for release of cytostatics. MDR1,

MRP2, and MRP4 transporters are mainly present at the apical
side in normal kidney tubule cells. All five tested cell lines showed
high expression of MRP2 and 4 (Fig. 1C). Expression of MDR1
varied as follows: in A498, 7860 and ACHN cells expression was
found at a high level, and in LN78 at a low level. RCCNG1 did not
show any detectable MDR1 expression (as shown in Fig. 1C).
Uptake experiments. To characterize the functional expression
of the transporters in the renal carcinoma cells, we performed
uptake experiments with well-documented substrates of OATs
(p-aminohippurate, PAH) or OCTs (N-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium
iodide, MPP), respectively. The functional expression of OAT1
could not be confirmed by the specific uptake of [3H]PAH. Neither
of the kidney tumor cells showed a probenecid inhibitable
transporter-mediated PAH uptake (data not shown). Functional
expression of OCT3 in the RCC and CHO cells was examined and
quantified by uptake of [3H]MPP. As ACHN and A498 cell lines
did not show any expression of other OCT members, MPP
uptake should be mainly mediated by hOCT3. The MPP uptake
results with A498 and ACHN cells were compared with those of
OCT3-stably transfected CHO cells and mock-CHO cells as a
model. As shown in Fig. 2A, the uptake of [3H]MPP in OCT3-CHO
cells was 3.5 F 0.01 pmol/5 min/10 6 cells, which was
11-fold higher than in nonexpressing mock-CHO cells (0.2 F
0.01 pmol/5 min/106 cells; P < 0.00001). OCT3-mediated [3H]MPP
uptake was significantly inhibited by 100 Amol/L quinine (0.55 F
0.02 pmol/5 min/106 cells; P < 0.00001) and 500 Amol/L MPP
(0.47 F 0.05 pmol/5 min/106 cells; P < 0.00001). Tetraethylammonium (TEA) at a concentration of 1 mmol/L inhibited [3H]MPP
uptake partially (1.32 F 0.04 pmol/5 min/106 cells; P < 0.00001).
Nontransfected CHO cells did not show a quinine- or MPPinhibited uptake of [3H]MPP. As shown in Fig. 2B, the hOCT3expressing A498 cells showed a 10-fold higher [3H]MPP uptake
(2.11 F 0.1 pmol/5 min/106 cells P < 0.00001) compared with
ACHN cells (0.29 F 0.003 pmol/5 min/106 cells), which do not
express OCT3. The [3H]MPP uptake in A498 cells was abolished by
100 Amol/L quinine (0.3 F 0.003 pmol/5 min/106 cells P < 0.00001)
and by 500 Amol/L nonlabeled MPP (0.31 F 0.01 pmol/5 min/106
cells P < 0.00001). 1 mmol/L TEA caused a 65% decrease in
[3H]MPP uptake compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2B).
Inhibition of [3H]MPP uptake by cytostatic substances. To
elucidate the interaction of hOCT3 with cytostatic drugs, we
examined the inhibition of hOCT3-mediated [3H]MPP uptake by a
range of widely used cytostatic agents. The results are summarized
in Fig. 3. [3H]MPP uptake was significantly inhibited by 100 Amol/L
of irinotecan to 19.6% F 0.7% (P < 0.0001), vincristine to 29.5% F
1.7% (P < 0.0001), melphalan to 40.5% F 0.7% (P < 0.0001), and
prednisone to 64.1% F 4.1% (P < 0.01), of the uptake into untreated
cells. Doxorubicin, methotrexate, fluoroadenine, and cyclophosphamide showed weak, but significant inhibition (P < 0.05) of
[3H]MPP uptake, to 82.2% F 3.5%, 90.1% F 3.1%, 77.9% F 3.1%, and
84.5% F 1.4%, respectively, of untreated cells. Cisplatin, cytoarabinoside, and busulfan did not inhibit an interaction with hOCT3
(Fig. 3).
The type of interaction and affinity of cytostatics with a high
inhibitory effect on [3H]MPP uptake were analyzed by Dixon plots.
Three experiments were performed for each drug, and a
representative experiment is shown in Fig. 4A to C. All tested
compounds interacted with hOCT3 in a competitive manner. The
calculated K i values for irinotecan, vincristine, and melphalan are
1.75 F 0.45 Amol/L, 17 F 4.5 Amol/L, and 366 F 51 Amol/L,
respectively.

hOCT3 and Impact on Chemosensitivity in RCC Lines

Evaluation of the OCT3-mediated cytostatic activity of
melphalan by [3H]thymidine incorporation. As melphalan is a
DNA damaging agent, its cytotoxic activity was measured by the
[3H]thymidine incorporation assay. We observed that, compared
with CHO-mock cells, CHO-OCT3-expressing cells have 10% F 3%
(P < 0.05) less [3H]thymidine incorporation upon treatment with
10 Amol/L melphalan, 20% F 4.5% (P < 0.01) less with 50 Amol/L
melphalan, and 35% F 6.4% (P < 0.01) less with 100 Amol/L
melphalan, indicating that OCT3-expressing cells are more
sensitive to melphalan (Fig. 5A). For A498 cells (OCT-3 expressing
RCC), 35% F 7.3% (P < 0.01) less [3H] thymidine incorporation was
seen with 10 Amol/L melphalan, 30% F 4.4% (P < 0.01) less with
50 Amol/L, and 2% (not significant) less with 100 Amol/L,
compared with ACHN cells (Fig. 5B).
To prove hOCT3-mediated melphalan sensitivity, both CHO and
RCC cells were incubated simultaneously with TEA to inhibit OCT3
(Fig. 5C and D). CHO-hOCT3 was more sensitive to melphalan at a
concentration of 50 Amol/L compared with CHO-mock cells. In the
presence of 50 Amol/L melphalan together with 2 mmol/L TEA,
control cells and CHO-OCT3 showed no difference in [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 5C). The TEA-dependent recovery of
[3H]thymidine incorporation in CHO-hOCT3 was 12% F 4.7%

(P < 0.05) compared with cells treated only with melphalan. Renal
carcinoma cells A498 with high hOCT3 expression are more
sensitive to melphalan compared with the low hOCT3-expressing
ACHN cells. The simultaneous treatment of A498 with 2 mmol/L
TEA lead to a 5% recovery of the [3H]thymidine incorporation
(Fig. 5D).
Evaluation of the hOCT-3–mediated cytostatic activity of
irinotecan and vincristine. The sensitivity of CHO-hOCT3 cells to
irinotecan was not significantly higher than that of the nontransfected CHO. MPP, TEA, and verapamil alone did not influence
viability (Fig. 6A). The irinotecan effect on CHO-OCT3 cells was
increased up to 25% F 3.3% (P < 0.01) upon additional treatment
with 1 Amol/L verapamil to block MDR1 (Fig. 6A). In the presence
of 500 Amol/L MPP or 2 mmol/L TEA, the cell viability was
reversed (P < 0.01). The viability of CHO-hOCT3 treated by
vincristine was decreased by 40% F 2.5% (P < 0.001), and after
verapamil treatment it was decreased additionally by 19% F 3%
(Fig. 6B). The cytotoxic effect of vincristine was partially restored
by 15% F 1.7% (P < 0.01) upon adding 2 mmol/L TEA.
Vincristine and irinotecan sensitivities of RCC cells were also
tested by the MTT assay (Fig. 6C and D). In contrast to OCT3-stably
transfected CHO cells, irinotecan did not show significant differences in the cytotoxic effect between A498 and ACHN cells
(Fig. 6C). Renal cancer cells tested by vincristine showed a behavior
similar to CHO-OCT3 cells (Fig. 6D). Vincristine-treated A498 cells
were 18% F 2.5% more sensitive to the cytostatic compared with
ACHN cells. The effect of vincristine was elevated to 25% F 1.2% by
additional treatment with 1 Amol/L verapamil. The cytotoxic effect
of vincristine was slightly reversed in cells incubated with
500 Amol/L MPP and 2 mmol/L TEA.

involvement in resistance of cancer cells to cytostatics is a widely
accepted fact. The involvement of efflux pumps such as MDR and
MRPs in cytostatics resistance and therapy has been intensively
investigated in the last decade. In contrast, little is known about
the contribution of influx or uptake transporters in tumor therapy
and transporter-mediated sensitivity for cytostatics. Therefore, we
initially examined the expression of several uptake transportes in
renal carcinoma cell lines. Organic anion and cation transporters
(OATs, OCTs) belong to the SLC22 gene family. The OAT and OCT
transporters are highly expressed in the kidneys, but also in the
liver, blood-brain barrier and several other tissues (15). The organic
anion transporters have a very high affinity for negatively charged
organic substrates, such as endogenous metabolites such as
a-ketoglutarate, prostaglandin E2, estrone sulfate, dehydroepiandosterone sulfate, cyclic AMP, or cyclic guanosine 3¶,5¶-monophosphate. Exogenous drugs known to be transported by OATs
include h-lactam antibiotics, antiviral drugs, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, diuretics, and cytostatics (16, 17). OATs are
responsible for proximal tubule uptake and excretion of these
substances. The organic cation transporters possess an affinity for
positively charged endogenous (epinephrine, norepinephrine, etc.)
and exogenous substances (MPP, TEA, quinine; ref. 9, 18). It was
also shown that OCTs play an important role in the drug
distribution in the organism (15), drug transport from blood to
brain (19) and excretion from the body.
The ABC transporters are widely distributed. In the kidneys
a few members of the ABC family such as MRP1, MRP2, MRP4,
and MDR1 are highly expressed (20, 21). Physiologically these
transporters pump out endogenous ‘‘waste,’’ glutathione conjugates, and glucoronides, and exogenous hydrophobic xenobiotic
such as benzapyrenes (22). The functions of ABC transporters
include, of course, the excretion of cytostatics from cancer
cells (23), which renders tumor cells chemoresistant. We
performed in kidney cancer cell lines a screening of the ABC
transporter family to compare the level of the expression with
the expression of the SLC family members. Most of the tested
ABC transporters were highly expressed. It will be very important
in the planning of chemotherapy to consider the expression
level of the ABC transporters because they counteract the uptake
transporters.
As a target for cytostatic uptake in tumor cells, we examined the
expression level of organic anion transporters in the kidney tumor
cell lines 7860, RCCNG1, A498, LN78, and ACHN. Thus far, nothing
was known of the expression of OATs in kidney tumor cells, and
little about the interaction of cytostatics with organic anion
transporters. Up to now, only the interaction of methotrexate with
organic anion transporters was reported (23). On the other hand,
the use of cytostatics in the cancer treatment may cause an
accumulation of these drugs in the kidney proximal tubule cells
and result in complications such as nephropathy (3). Our study
revealed the expression of OAT1 in kidney cancer cell lines on the
mRNA level. However, we observed a very low level of PAH uptake,
and the uptake could not be inhibited by 500 Amol/L probenecid,
a standard blocker of organic anion transporter systems. We
conclude from our data that OAT1 was not functionally detectable
in the kidney tumor cell lines. Therefore, organic anion transporters are not the appropriate target for chemotherapy of RCC
with anionic cytostatics.

hOCT3 and Impact on Chemosensitivity in RCC Lines

Previous studies show that OCT2 is responsible for cisplatin
accumulation inside the kidney and brain tissues. Nephropathies
and neuropathies have been observed after chemotherapy with
cisplatin due to accumulation of these cytostatics (3, 24). In
HEK293, cells expressing organic cation transporter OCT1
and OCT2 as well as OCT2 and OCT3 cisplatin and oxaliplatin
mediated cytotoxicity as reported by Yonezaw and colleagues (13).
Quantification of OCT3 expression within the five tested renal
carcinoma cells lines by real-time PCR indicated a high variability
of expression. A498 cells showed the highest mRNA expression of
OCT3 compared with ACHN and RCCNG1 cells. To prove the
functional expression of the transporter, we chose the nonexpressing ACHN cell line and highly OCT3-expressing cell line A498 to
perform an OCT3-mediated uptake of the model substrate,
[3H]MPP. As a positive control, we carried out the same experiments with hOCT3-stably transfected CHO cells and mock cells.
The uptake experiment with A498 cells revealed a >10 fold higher
[3H]MPP accumulation than in ACHN cells. Uptake was inhibited
by unlabeled organic cations, MPP, quinine, and TEA. The MPP
uptake data achieved with hOCT3 and mock CHO cells corresponded perfectly to the results of the renal carcinoma cells A498
and ACHN. These data show, for the first time, that OCT3 is
functional in some renal cancer cells.
Functional expression of OCT3 in renal cancer cells renders this
transporter an appropriate candidate for kidney tumor therapy
with cytostatics. However, little is known of the interaction of
OCT3 with cytostatics. Koepsell and colleagues (9) reported the
interaction of mitoxantrone with OCT3. Therefore, we examined
the interaction of several cytostatics on the hOCT3-mediated
[3H]MPP uptake in stably transfected CHO cells. One hundred
moles of irinotecan, vincristine, and melphalan inhibited OCT3
facilitated MPP uptake by >60%, whereas methotrexate, doxoru-

bicin, fluoroadenine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone reduced
the OCT3 activity less but still significantly. hOCT6 showed in
contrast to hOCT3 very high affinity (K m 5.2 Amol/L) for
doxorubicin (25). OCT6 was not expressed in the kidney and renal
carcinoma cells. Consequently, OCT6 cannot be considered in the
kidney tumor therapy. Cisplatin, cytoarabinoside, and busulfan did
not show any interaction with hOCT3. Zhang and colleagues (12)
reported the interaction of oxaliplatin with OCT1 and OCT2, but
not with OCT3. They showed the cytostatic effect of oxaliplatin,
which was much higher than that of cisplatin in six colon cancer
cell lines.
Dixon plot analysis revealed a competitive inhibition of OCT3
and the highest affinity for irinotecan followed by vincristine and
melphalan. Because these cytostatics were not available in
radioactive form, uptake by OCT3 could not be tested directly.
However, the OCT3-mediated uptake of these three cytostatics
could indirectly be shown by the transporter-dependent
cytostatic effect evaluated by thymidine incorporation and cell
viability. CHO-OCT3 cells and OCT3 expressing A498 tumor cells
showed less thymidine incorporation after melphalan treatment
compared with cells without OCT3 expression. Melphalan taken
up into the cells binds to -NH2 and -SH groups of proteins or
nucleic acids (26). The mustard-nucleoside derivates generated
by melphalan (27) prevent DNA replication, resulting in reduced
thymidine incorporation. Simultaneous incubation of melphalan
and TEA resulted in a partial restoration of the thymidine
incorporation in OCT3-expressing CHO cells. These experiments
strongly favor OCT3-mediated translocation of melphalan and
the increase of the cytotoxic effect on OCT3-expressing cells. The
cytotoxic effect of melphalan could not be prevented by TEA in
the A498 tumor cells, most probably because of high expression
of L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1) in these cells, as shown

treated for 30 min with various
concentrations of melphalan as follows: A,

by RT-PCR in this study. The affinity of LAT1 for melphalan was
recently reported (28).
Comparable evidence for the OCT3-mediated cytostatic effect in
CHO and A498 cells was observed with irinotecan and vincristine by
a cell viability test. Irinotecan is a strong inhibitor of topoisomerase
I (29) that plays an important role in DNA duplication, RNA
translation, and in cell cycle. Irinotecan is a positively charged
substance that has a partial structural similarity to MPP. After
uptake into the cell, irinotecan is converted to SN38 by hydrolysis.
SN38 is inactivated by glucoronidation (30) the cytotoxic activity is
dependent on the concentration of the active SN38 product inside
the cells and on MDR1, which exports SN38 (31).
Vincristine is a potent cytostatic that is used for the treatment
of blood cancers such as non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma and
lymphoblastic leukemia. The main intracellular target for
vincristine is the mitotic spindle. Vincristine binds to tubulin
molecules and prevents their polymerization (32). After vincristine
treatment, cells cannot divide and this leads to cell death by
apoptosis (33).

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

A498 and CHO-OCT3 cells showed a greater sensitivity for
vincristine than for irinotecan. The effect of vincristine and
irinotecan could be increased by additional incubation with a
potent MDR inhibitor verapamil (5). MDR1 expression was
detected in CHO cells (34). It was found that OCT3-CHO treated
with irinotecan and verapamil had a lower viability compared with
nonexpressing CHO cells. Vincristine was more toxic than
irinotecan. A possible reason could be the high affinity to tubulin,
the resulting complexes having a low constant of dissociation.
Additional treatment with verapamil amplified the cytotoxic effect
of vincristine. This cytostatic effect was only slightly reversed by a
substrate of OCT3. This finding suggests that even low amounts of
vincristine disturb the microtubule net in an irreversible manner.
One pronounced side effect of vincristine is neuropathy (35). This
side effect could be due to OCT3-mediated transport because
OCT3 is expressed in the central neural system (9).
In the present study, we examined the dependence of cytostatic
activities on influx transporters expressed in renal carcinoma cell
lines. As a proof of principle, we showed the OCT3-mediated

cytostatic sensitivity. This fact renders OCT3 an appropriate
candidate for individualized kidney tumor therapy. Along these
lines, it is worthwhile considering to test for OCT3 expression and
to tailor the cytostatics therapy.
