Abstract
Targeting androgen receptor (AR) by pharmacologic intervention is one of the effective approaches for treatment of
malignant prostate cancers. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) alters
the epigenetic status of tumor-associated genes, including
those for miRNAs (miRNA), and affects the behavior of
cancers. Here, we examined the molecular effects of a HDAC
inhibitor, OBP-801, on AR expression and tumor cell growth
in prostate cancers. Treatment with OBP-801 efﬁciently suppressed cell growth of three prostate cancer lines (22Rv1,
VCaP, and LNCaP), together with AR downregulation, regardless of their hormone sensitivity. Intriguingly, this effect by
OBP-801 was not due to decreased transcriptional activity of
the AR gene, but due to posttranscriptional regulation, namely
by miRNA-mediated suppression. Among the upregulated
miRNAs after OBP-801 treatment in the three prostate cancer
cell lines, miR-320a, whose expression was signiﬁcantly cor-

related with prognosis of prostate cancers (P ¼ 0.0185), was
the most closely associated with AR expression. An miR-320a
mimic suppressed AR protein expression together with growth
suppression, while anti-miR-320a oligonucleotide signiﬁcantly
abrogated the growth suppression by OBP-801 treatment.
FISH analysis revealed that miR-320a was highly expressed in
human normal prostate luminal cells, but was rarely expressed
in prostate cancer cells. In an AR-dependent prostate tumorigenic rat model, OBP-801 treatment profoundly increased
miR-320a expression and repressed prostate tumorigenesis.
Our data demonstrated that OBP-801 effectively suppressed
AR activity via epigenetic upregulation of miR-320a, which
resulted in tumor cell growth suppression of prostate cancers.
OBP-801 may be a potent AR-targeting therapeutic reagent
in AR-positive prostate cancer regardless of androgen dependency. Cancer Res; 76(14); 4192–204. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

circulating testosterone level or inhibit androgen binding to the
androgen receptor, they subsequently acquire resistance to those
deprivation therapies, and result in castration-resistant prostate
cancers (CRPC), which have a high mortality rate (2).
The mechanisms governing the reactivation of the proliferative
potential of CRPCs despite castrate levels of testosterone have
been comprehensively studied. For example, alternative activation of several signaling pathways for cell growth rather than AR
signaling, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and nuclear
factor-kB (NF-kB), have been reported (3, 4). However, the
predominant mechanisms for cancer cell proliferation under
deprivation conditions are still due to reactivated AR signaling,
such as by overexpression or mutation of the AR (5). Indeed, AR
overexpression shortens the period of tumor latency and confers
resistance to antiandrogen therapies (6, 7). Therefore, therapies
aimed at blocking the AR signaling axis, such as depletion of the
AR level by pharmacologic intervention, are still promising
approaches to treat uncontrolled CRPCs.
To suppress aberrant AR activity, different types of inhibitors
have been studied including those that inhibit androgen synthesis, androgen secretion, and kinases related to the AR signaling
pathway (8, 9). In addition to such inhibitors, histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors have recently been reported to suppress AR
activity (10–12). Although the therapeutic approach using HDAC
inhibitors to suppress the AR signaling pathway appears to have
some efﬁcacy in the treatment of prostate cancer, the mechanisms
by which HDAC inhibitors repress AR activity and inhibit tumor

Prostate cancer is the second highest cause of cancer-related
deaths in men in the United States. More than 240,000 patients
are newly diagnosed with prostate cancer (1). This cancer is highly
dependent on the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway;
therefore, androgen deprivation therapy has been the standard
treatment for high-risk localized prostate cancer and metastasized
prostate cancer. Although initially most of the hormone-na€ve
prostate cancers respond to established therapies that reduce

Regulation of AR by miR-320

cell proliferation through epigenetic priming are questions that
have arisen that need to be addressed.
Recent evidence has shown that miRNA plays an important
role in tumorigenesis by regulating oncogenic and tumor suppressor genes in human cancers (13). In prostate cancers, several
studies have shown that miRNAs can suppress AR expression
(14–17). Of interest, the expression of some miRNAs is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and
histone acetylation in human cancers, and may contribute to
tumorigenesis (18, 19). Thus, it is plausible that HDAC inhibitors may affect AR expression via miRNA regulation in prostate cancer cells.
In the current study, we used OBP-801, a novel bacteriaderived and cyclic peptide–based HDAC inhibitor. It exerts
potent HDAC-inhibitory activity, with tests showing it was
about 50 times more effective than SAHA, the most clinically
used HDAC inhibitor (20). In addition, it effectively repressed
class I HDAC (21). OBP-801 showed a novel regulatory mechanism of AR via induction of miR-320a expression in androgenpositive prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Prostate cancer tissues and cell lines
A total of 10 cases of surgically resected prostate cancer were
examined in this study. Detailed information about the cases is
described in Supplementary Table S1. Surgical resection was
performed in all cases at the Aichi Cancer Center Hospital after
appropriate institutional review board approval was received and
written informed consent had been obtained. Human CRPC cell
line (22Rv1), androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines
(LNCaP and VCaP), and PrEC (primary prostate epithelial cells)
were obtained from the ATCC. These cell lines were authenticated
through short tandem repeat proﬁling by JCRB Cell Bank (National Institute of Biomedical Innovation, Osaka, Japan) and were
tested to be Mycoplasma free. Although PrEC cell line was not
authenticated, relatively low passage number cells were obtained.
22Rv1, VCaP, and LNCaP cells were treated with OBP-801, which
was a gift from Dr. Yasuo Urata (Oncolys Biopharma), Trichostatin A (TSA; T8552, Sigma Aldrich), suberoylanilide hydroxamic
acid (SAHA; Cayman Chemical #10009929), MS-275 (Cayman
Chemical #13284), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 24 or 48
hours, and fresh drug and medium were replaced every 24 hours.
The details were described in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Animal experiments and OBP-801 treatment
Male heterozygous transgenic rats for adenocarcinoma of
prostate (TRAP) with Sprague–Dawley genetic background were
used, in which prostate cancer arises spontaneously (22). A
total of 36 heterozygous male TRAP at 6 weeks of age were
randomly divided into 3 groups and treated with either control
(PBS, n ¼ 12), OBP-801-low dose (0.5 mg/kg, n ¼ 12), or -high
dose (2 mg/kg, n ¼ 12) intravenously 2 times a week for
8 weeks. All experiments were performed under protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences.
Manipulation of miR-320 in cell lines
Cells were transfected with the precursor molecule of miR-320a
(pre-miR-320a precursor, ﬁnal concentration of 100 nmol/L,

www.aacrjournals.org

Applied Biosystems) or negative control miRNA (pre-miR negative control #1, 100 nmol/L, Applied Biosystems) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Inhibition of miR-320a was performed using an anti-miR-320a oligonucleotide (100 nmol/L,
Applied Biosystems) or control anti-RNA (anti-miR inhibitor
negative control #1, 100 nmol/L, Applied Biosystems) according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
Reporter assays of AR promoter and 30 UTR regions
A fragment of the AR 30 -UTR (577 bp) region was ampliﬁed
with the primers listed in Supplementary Table S2 and ligated
into the pmirGLO luciferase reporter vector (Promega). The
AR 30 -UTR region contains two potential target sites of
miR-320a (þ5638 to þ5644 and þ5650 to þ5656 relative to
the start site of the AR 30 UTR sequence, accession number,
NM_001011645.2). A fragment of the AR promoter region
(991 bp) was ampliﬁed by PCR with the primers listed in
Supplementary Table S2 and ligated into pGL3 luciferase
reporter vector (Promega). Luciferase activities of AR 30 -UTR
and AR promoter luciferase constructs were measured using the
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). In both
assays, Renilla luminescence was used for normalization. For
details, see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Migration and invasion assay
Migration capacity was measured by Transwell assays (BD
Biosciences). Cells (40,000) were seeded in RPMI 1% FBS in the
upper part of a cell culture chamber insert system separated
from the bottom chamber by an 8-mm PET membrane. For the
invasion assay, the migration protocol was modiﬁed as follows:
Transwell top ﬁlters were precoated with 100 mL of a 0.5 mg/mL
phenol-red free Matrigel (BD Biosciences)/PBS solution overnight
at room temperature and washed with PBS. Cells were allowed to
invade for 24 hours, and then invaded cells were counted. The
details were described in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
miRNA array
Total RNAs were extracted from 22Rv1, VCaP, and LNCaP cells
treated with 10 nmol/L of OBP-801 or DMSO for 24 hours as well
as prostate cancer tissues from TRAP rats. One hundred nanograms
of total RNA from human prostate cancer cells or rat prostate
tissues were hybridized to human miRNA array (Human miRNA
Microarray, Release 19.0, Agilent Technologies) or rat miRNA array
(3D-Gene Rat miRNA Oligo chip, ver.21, Toray Industries Inc.),
according to the manufacturer's protocol. The data from our
microarrays are available in the ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/arrayexpress) with accession codes: GSE69489 (human
miRNA array) and GSE75022 (rat miRNA array).
HDAC activity assay
HDAC enzymatic activities of OBP-801, TSA, SAHA, and MS275 were measured by the ﬂuorometric HDAC Activity Assay Kit
(Abcam, #ab156064) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For details, see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
AR 30 UTR with deletion or mutation of miR-320a target site in
luciferase vector construct
To generate the luciferase reporter vectors, AR 30 -UTR fragments were ampliﬁed by PCR from human cDNAs and inserted

Regulation of AR by miR-320

into the pmirGLO vector between Nhel and Xbal sites (Promega). Then, PCR with primer sets (Supplementary Table S2)
was performed to generate deleted or mutated miR-320a target
sites in AR 30 -UTR using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).
IHC
Immunohistochemical staining in 10 human prostate cancer
specimens and 24 rat prostate specimens was carried out. AR
protein was ambiguously detected in cytoplasm of both human as
well as TRAP rat prostate cancer cells and normal prostate luminal
cells by immunohistochemical analysis. Therefore, we only analyzed nuclear AR expression. A total of 100 cell nuclei in at least
three views from each case were analyzed. For details, see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Prediction of miRNAs targeting AR
To ﬁnd known and putative miRNAs that target AR, we
used the miRNA target prediction database: miRWalk 2.0
(http://www.umm.uni-heidelberg.de/apps/zmf/mirwalk/; ref. 23).
miRWalk2.0 combines information on target-miRNA interaction
resulting from 12 public miRNA-target prediction programs:
miRWalk2.0, DIANA-microTv4.0 (http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/index.php?r¼microtv4/; ref. 24), miRandarel2010 (http://www.microrna.org/microrna/), mirBridge (25),
miRDB4.0 (http://mirdb.org/miRDB/), miRmap (http://
mirmap.ezlab.org/), miRNAMap (ftp://mirnamap.mbc.nctu.
edu.tw/miRNAMap2), PicTar2 (http://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/),
PITA (http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/mir07/), RNA22v2
(https://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22/), RNAhybrid2.1 (http://bibiserv.
techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid/), and Targetscan6.2 (http://
www.targetscan.org/cgi-bin/targetscan/data_download.cgi?db¼
vert_61). The algorithm in miRWalk 2.0 assessed the probability
of a given miRNA–target interaction and gave the predicted
values (24).
miRNA in situ hybridization
miRNA in situ hybridization was performed using QuantiGene
ViewRNA assay (Affymetrix, Inc). For details, see Supplementary
Materials and Methods.

Results
OBP-801 decreased cell proliferation and AR expression in
22Rv1, VCaP, and LNCaP cells
First, we assessed the effects of OBP-801 on cell proliferation,
migration, and invasion in CRPC (22Rv1) and androgen-dependent (VCaP and LNCaP) cell lines. Regardless of hormone sen-

sitivity status, cell growth, migration, and invasion of all of the
prostate cancer cell lines were signiﬁcantly suppressed by OBP801 treatment even at a dose of 10 nmol/L (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). In addition, OBP-801 treatment also
signiﬁcantly decreased the AR expression at both protein and
mRNA levels in all three prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 1B).
Consistently, OBP-801 also suppressed PSA protein expression,
which is well known to be downstream of AR signaling (Supplementary Fig. S2A) (5, 6). Suppression of cell growth by OBP-801
was eliminated by exogenous expression of AR, indicating that the
tumor-suppressive effect of OBP-801 was due to, at least in part,
suppression of AR activity (Fig. 1C).
HDAC inhibitors, such as OBP-801, are known to increase the
acetylation level in the target gene promoters together with
upregulation of their expression. To clarify the epigenetic effects
of OBP-801 on AR promoter activity, we performed a luciferase
assay using an AR promoter construct (Fig. 1D). Interestingly,
treatment with OBP-801 increased AR promoter activity by
almost 1.5-fold together with a 1.3-fold increase in histone
H3K9 acetylation (Fig. 1E). These data indicated that reduction
of AR expression by OBP-801 was not due to downregulation of
transcriptional activity, but rather that another mechanism, such
as posttranscriptional regulation, may be involved in this process.
Identiﬁcation of miR-320 as an AR-targeting miRNA
To investigate the posttranscriptional regulation of AR after
OBP-801 treatment, we examined miRNA expression in LNCaP,
VCaP, and 22Rv1 cells using miRNA microarray. Ninety-one
miRNAs were upregulated in at least 1 of 3 cell lines (>1.5-fold
compared with untreated control, Supplementary Table S3), and
31 miRNAs were commonly upregulated in more than two
cell lines after OBP-801 treatment (Fig. 2A, left). Interestingly,
members of the miR-320 family were found among these
commonly upregulated miRNAs (i.e., miR-320a, miR-320c,
miR-320d, and miR-320e).
Among these miRNAs, we searched for those that may be
AR-targeting miRNA using miRWalk2.0 computational analysis,
whose algorithm assesses the probability of a given miRNA–target
interaction and gives predicted values (24). We found that the
miRNAs with the highest prediction values against AR 30 -UTR
were miR-320a, -320c, -320d, and -3065 (Fig. 2A, right). AR has 3
miR-320 target sites, and 4 miR-3065 target sites are in its 30 -UTR
(Fig. 2B). We further examined the expression of miR-320a and
miR-3065 and found that the expression level of miR-320a was
more than 100 times higher than that of miR-3065 both with and
without OBP-801 treatment in all 3 cancer cell lines, suggesting
that miR-320a plays a more prominent role in AR regulation in
these cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A).

relative to the position of the stop codon of AR (the ﬁrst nucleotide after the stop codon of AR is deﬁned as "1").

miR-320a was signiﬁcantly inversely correlated with AR
mRNA expression in prostate cancer and overall survival
in prostate cancer patients
Next, we analyzed the relationship between 31 miRNAs
identiﬁed by the microarray and AR mRNA expression in a large
cohort of prostate cancers using the The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) public database (n ¼ 317). AR mRNA expression was

0.372, P ¼ 2.09  1019, Fig. 3A). In addition, correlation
coefﬁcient analysis showed the most signiﬁcant positive relationship between miR-320a and overall survival (R ¼ 0.12 and P
¼ 0.00633; Fig. 3B). Consistently, patients with low levels of
miR-320a showed worse prognosis than those with high levels
when patients were divided into miR-320a–low and -high
groups based on the median expression level of miR-320a (Fig.

3C, P ¼ 0.0185). Together, these data suggested that miR-320,
especially miR-320a, affected the clinical behavior of prostate
cancers by regulation of AR activity.
miR-320a was increased by H3K9 acetylation after OBP-801
treatment and functionally suppressed AR expression
We further examined whether miR-320a bona ﬁde can functionally suppress AR expression upon exposure of prostate
cancer cells to OBP-801. miR-320a expression in cancer cell
lines was signiﬁcantly lower than that in PrEC, a normal prostate
luminal cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1C). However it was
signiﬁcantly upregulated after treatment with OBP-801 in all 3
prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, other HDAC
inhibitors, such as TSA and SAHA, had minimal impact on
miR-320a expression at any dose while MS-275 (5 mmol/L), a

Regulation of AR by miR-320

class I HDAC inhibitor, also signiﬁcantly increased miR-320a
expression (Fig. 4A). IC50 of these drugs were less than 100–200
nmol/L (OBP-801, TSA, and SAHA) or around 1 mmol/L (MS275; Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Next, epigenetic changes in the miR-320a promoter region
after OBP-801 treatment were examined. The transcriptional
start site (TSS) of pri-miR-320a (Fig. 4B) was determined by
the Database of Transcriptional Start Sites (DBTSS, http://
dbtss.hgc.jp/) and ﬁndings from previous studies (26, 27).
OBP-801 signiﬁcantly increased H3K9 acetylation levels in
the miR-320a promoter in the three prostate cancer cell lines
(Fig. 4C). This was also true for miR-320c, whose expression
was also efﬁciently induced by OBP-801 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C).
Transfection of the pre-miR-320a precursor showed that exogenous miR-320a signiﬁcantly suppressed cell proliferation (P ¼
0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P ¼ 0.0006 in 22Rv1, VCaP, and
LNCaP, respectively, Fig. 4D) as well as AR protein expression
in all cell lines. To clarify whether OBP-801 could reduce AR
expression via interaction between its 30 -UTR and miR-320a,
anti-miR-320a was cotransfected with an AR 30 -UTR-luciferase
construct into prostate cancer cell lines with OBP-801 treatment.
Reduced AR 30 -UTR-luciferase activity by OBP-801 was partially
rescued by anti-miR-320a (P ¼ 0.032, P ¼ 0.0013, and P ¼ 0.025
in 22Rv1, VCaP, and LNCaP, respectively, Fig. 4E). Furthermore,
reduced AR 30 -UTR-luciferase activity by OBP-801 was disrupted
if the miR-320a target sites in AR 30 -UTR were mutated or deleted
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). These data indicated that OBP-801
increased the expression of miR-320a via acetylation of its
promoter region, resulting in suppression of AR expression and
cell growth in 22Rv1, VCaP, and LNCaP.
miR-320a expression in human prostate cancer tissues and
prostate cancer cell lines
miRNA-FISH analysis in prostate cancer cell lines showed
that miR-320a expression was signiﬁcantly increased after OBP801 treatment (P < 0.0001, Fig. 5A and B). To determine the
clinical relevance of the interaction between miR-320a and AR,
miRNA-FISH analysis was also performed in human prostate
cancers. miRNA-FISH analysis in normal prostate tissues
revealed that miR-320a was highly expressed in human normal
prostate luminal cells where AR expression was at baseline level
(Fig. 5C). In contrast, less miR-320a expression was detected in
human prostate cancerous tissues, especially where AR expression was high (10 normal prostate and 10 cancerous tissues,
Fig. 5C). The average amount of miR-320a signals in cancer
cells was signiﬁcantly less than in normal prostate luminal cells

(P ¼ 0.0023, Fig. 5D). AR signal intensity in cancer cells was
signiﬁcantly higher than that in normal prostate luminal cells
(P < 0.0001, Fig. 5E).
miR-320a was increased in rat prostate cancer tissues after
treatment with OBP-801
We ﬁnally examined whether OBP-801 treatment could also
be potent in prostate adenocarcinoma in vivo using a prostate
tumorigenic rat model, TRAP, in which adenocarcinomas arise
in all prostatic lobes in an AR-dependent manner within 15
weeks of age (22, 28). Our preliminary study showed that
OBP-801 treatment with 5 mg/kg for 2 weeks resulted in a
slight body weight loss while there was no apparent weight
loss with treatment using 2.5 mg/kg for 2 weeks. Therefore, we
established two treatment arms (2 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg of
OBP-801 for 8 weeks) in the TRAP model. Indeed, neither arm
showed apparent body weight loss during 8 weeks of treatment (Fig. 6A).
The incidence of prostate cancer in the lateral lobes was
signiﬁcantly decreased in the rats treated with the high dose
(2 mg/kg) of OBP-801 [5/10 (50%) versus 10/11 (90.9%) in
control, P ¼ 0.0382, Fig. 6B]. In the low-dose group (0.5 mg/kg),
OBP-801 tended to decrease carcinogenesis of prostate cancer,
but not as efﬁciently compared with the high dose [7/11
(63.6%), P ¼ 0.1269, Fig. 6B]. Pathologic analysis in lateral
lobes revealed that TRAP rats without OBP-801 treatment developed well-differentiated prostate adenocarcinomas. By clear
contrast, the majority of cells in high-dose OBP-801–treated
TRAP rats rarely transformed into adenocarcinoma, but instead
resided in a precancerous condition, which corresponded to
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN, Fig. 6C; ref. 28). AR
expression in the PIN in the TRAP rats treated with OBP-801 was
signiﬁcantly lower than that in the PIN in the TRAP rats without
treatment (P < 0.0001, Fig. 6D, left). Intriguingly, a few TRAP
rats treated with OBP-801 showed adenocarcinoma in lateral
lobes, in which AR expression was at a similar level to those
without treatment (Fig. 6D, right).
The miRNA array analysis of lateral prostate tissues of OBP801-treated rats showed that 11 and 40 miRNAs were up- and
downregulated (more than 2-fold) compared with the controls,
respectively (Fig. 6E). Among those miRNAs, rno-miR-320a was
the most highly upregulated miRNA (2.51 fold more than control). Quantitative PCR showed that OBP-801 treatment significantly increased rno-miR-320a expression in lateral prostate tissues including PIN (Fig. 6F). These data suggested that OBP-801
treatment inhibited prostate carcinogenesis in the TRAP model,
probably due to induction of miR-320a expression.

Discussion
In the current study, we demonstrated that the antitumor effects
of OBP-801 by activating miR-320a, which consequently reduced
AR mRNA and protein levels, could efﬁciently suppress cell
proliferation in prostate cancers including CRPC cell line.
Although CRPCs are termed as "androgen-independent prostate
cancer," accumulating evidence showed that the majority of
CRPCs still continue to depend on AR signaling, which is reactivated despite the low level of serum testosterone (2). Therefore,

4200 Cancer Res; 76(14) July 15, 2016

targeting AR signaling pathways is a promising potential approach
for the treatment of CRPC.
Treatment options for CRPC were hitherto limited to some
chemotherapies, such as docetaxel, that have been shown to
prolong survival (29, 30). Recently, several novel secondgeneration antiandrogen agents for treatment of advanced
prostate cancer have been investigated, such as enzalutamide
and abiraterone, which markedly prolonged CRPC patient
survival (31). Enzalutamide is an AR antagonist that blocks
androgen from binding to the AR and prevents nuclear

translocation and coactivator recruitment of the ligand–receptor complex (8, 32). Abiraterone is an inhibitor of cytochrome
P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) that impairs AR signaling by depleting
adrenal and intratumoral androgens (33). These drugs significantly prolonged the survival of patients, especially those with
metastatic CRPCs (34). However, CRPCs with a certain type of
mutation, tandem duplication of AR exon 3 (AR-V7), which
encodes a variant protein lacking the ligand-binding domain
and is active in a hormone-independent manner, are still
resistant to these drugs (35, 36). This mutation is one of the
most abundant variants found in prostate cancer cell lines
including 22Rv1 and VCaP cell lines (35, 37). In the current
study, OBP-801 efﬁciently suppressed both wild-type and
AR-V7 AR expression in 22Rv1, suggesting that OBP-801 might
also have a therapeutic effect on AR-V7–positive CRPC (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
OBP-801 repressed AR expression and cell proliferation in
all three cell lines (22Rv1, VCaP, and LNCaP). Several studies
including some clinical trials conducted on CRPCs have reported
that HDAC inhibitors, such as TSA, SAHA, panobinostat, and
valproic acid, suppressed AR expression (38–40). However, the
detailed mechanisms of suppression of AR by these HDAC
inhibitors remain undeﬁned (11, 12). Consistent with these
previous reports, we also found that all of the HDAC inhibitors
examined suppressed AR protein expression (Supplementary Fig.
S2C). Of interest, OBP-801 signiﬁcantly upregulated miR-320a in
all three prostate cancer cell lines, while the other HDAC inhibitors, TSA and SAHA, had minimal impact on miR-320a expression. One of the reasons for the difference in reactivation of miR320a by the HDAC inhibitors might be due to the differences of
diverse inhibitory activity of each chemical against HDACs (41,
42). OBP-801 is a cyclic peptide–based HDAC inhibitor derived
from a natural product containing a disulﬁde bond. The IC50 for
the HDAC inhibitory activity of OBP-801, TSA, SAHA, and MS275 were under or around 1 mmol/L in our study (Supplementary
Fig. S1D). With regard to the isozyme selectivities of HDAC
inhibitors, SAHA and TSA showed pan-HDAC inhibitory properties, while OBP-801 is a more potent inhibitor of HDAC1 (class I
HDAC), but showed markedly reduced activity against different
class of HDACs, such as HDAC6 (class II HDAC; refs. 21, 43).
Interestingly, MS-275, another speciﬁc inhibitor of class I HDAC
that is now under clinical trials for breast cancer and lymphoma
(44, 45), increased miR-320a at a dose of 5 mmol/L (Fig. 4A). These
differences in selectivities against HDAC classes between OBP801 and MS-275 and the other two HDAC inhibitors, TSA and
SAHA, may explain the unique effects of OBP-801 on upregulation of miR-320a in prostate cancer cell lines. Indeed, targeting
speciﬁc HDACs with greater selectivity may be beneﬁcial in certain
cancers (46). For example, treatment of neuroblastoma with a
selective inhibitor of HDAC8 efﬁciently inhibited cell growth and
induced differentiation (47, 48). Therefore, signiﬁcant efforts
have been made to identify HDAC inhibitors with improved
HDAC isozyme selectivities (46).
It has become clear that miRNA contributes to gene regulatory
mechanisms as downstream effectors of HDAC inhibitors (19).
miRNA plays an important role in several malignancies and
regulates key genes that modulate tumorigenesis and progression
of cancers including prostate cancer (13). As the AR has a long 30 UTR, it is plausible that large numbers of miRNAs regulate AR
expression. Such dysregulated miRNAs altered the AR expression
and promoted cell growth in prostate cancers (17). Several studies

4202 Cancer Res; 76(14) July 15, 2016

showed that miRNAs, such as miR-34a, miR-34c, miR-124, miR205, miR-488 , and let-7c, function as suppressors of AR expression (14–17). Intriguingly, analyses of the TCGA dataset used in
the current study (Fig. 3) showed that some of the miRNAs were
indeed signiﬁcantly inversely correlated with AR mRNA expression, the most predominant of which was miR-320a [R ¼ 0.372
(P ¼ 2.09  1019), R ¼ 0.328 (P ¼ 4.02  1015), R ¼ 0.146
(P ¼ 0.000616), R ¼ 0.00176 (P ¼ 0.967), and R ¼ 0.00786 (P ¼
0.855) for miR-320a, 34a, 34c, 124, and let-7c, respectively, by
Pearson's correlation coefﬁcient]. These results support that miR320a may be a promising miRNA for targeting AR.
In the animal study, OBP-801 treatment profoundly increased
miR-320a expression and repressed prostate tumorigenesis. Interestingly, although treatment with OBP-801 was effective in the
majority of cases, a few rats still showed adenocarcinoma in lateral
lobes, in which the level of AR expression was similar to those
without treatment, suggesting heterogeneous effects of OBP-801
in vivo. Indeed, intratumoral treatment with OBP-801 (2 mg/kg, 2
times a week for 3 weeks) in the xenograft mouse model of 22Rv1
cells, which formed relatively homogeneous tumors, showed a
marked suppressive effect on tumor growth together with AR
downregulation (Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, inventing a
new approach, such as an effective drug delivery system combined
with OBP-801, may be beneﬁcial to obtain successful treatment.
Tumorigenesis in the TRAP model is promoted by SV40 T antigen,
whose expression is regulated by the androgen-dependent probasin promoter in a prostate-speciﬁc manner (22). In this regard,
TRAP is one of the most relevant animal models to assess the
regulatory effects of reagents on androgen-dependent cell proliferation pathway in vivo (49). Upregulation of miR-320a may also
decrease AR expression in this model, as 6 base-pairs that matched
two seed sequences of miR-320a were observed in the rat AR
gene, which may confer inhibition of target mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, the OBP-801–mediated suppressive effects of
prostate tumorigenesis may be due to attenuation of the AR
signaling pathway via miR-320, although further studies are
still needed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms, such as other
targets of miR-320a, including b-catenin, as was reported previously (Supplementary Fig. S2A; ref. 50).
In conclusion, we demonstrated a novel AR regulation mechanism by the HDAC inhibitor, OBP-801, via induction of miR-320
expression in prostate cancer. One of the concerns is that an
HDAC inhibitor alone might not be highly effective in solid
tumors, such as prostate cancers. Indeed, we found that combinations of OBP-801 and either bicalutamide (anti-androgen drug)
or docetaxel showed stronger effects on growth suppression than
OBP-801 alone (Supplementary Fig. S7). However, comparison
of OBP-801 to anti-androgen drugs, such as ﬁnasteride and
ﬂutamide, which we previously examined in the same rat model
(49), revealed that OBP-801 appears to be more potent. Although
further studies, including combination therapies, might be
required, we provide here strong evidence that OBP-801 is a
promising next-generation therapeutic reagent for prostate cancers, even CRPCs with AR mutations.
