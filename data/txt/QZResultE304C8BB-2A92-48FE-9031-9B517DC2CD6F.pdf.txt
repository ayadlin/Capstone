BACKGROUND: Current treatment strategies in pediatric oncology are intensive and lead to high survival rates but also to treatmentrelated complications. Therefore, supportive care plays an increasingly important role. This study was designed to evaluate variations
in supportive care practice in children with cancer in the Netherlands and adherence to selected existing international guidelines
through an in-depth review of local guidelines and protocols at all 6 Dutch pediatric cancer centers. METHODS: Based on shared
expert opinion, a questionnaire regarding current supportive care practice was compiled. For each center, the required information
was extracted from local supportive care guidelines, and the list was sent to a pediatric oncologist of that center to verify its correspondence with local daily practice. Subsequently, it was determined whether clinical practice was concordant (same in  5 of 6 centers), partly concordant (highly overlapping in  5 of 6 centers), or discordant (same in < 5 of 6 centers). Local practices were
compared with strong recommendations from high-quality, evidence-based guidelines. RESULTS: The questionnaire comprised 67
questions regarding supportive care practice. Concordance was observed for 11 of 67 practice items (16%), partial concordance was
observed for 6 of 67 practice items (9%), and discordance was observed for 50 of 67 practice items (75%). Adherence to strong recommendations of 4 high-quality, evidence-based guidelines varied but was generally low. CONCLUSIONS: Large variations exist in
pediatric oncology supportive care practice, and this could negatively influence care. Adherence to existing evidence-based guidelines and the development and implementation of new clinical practice guidelines have the potential of standardizing supportive care

INTRODUCTION
With the introduction of intensive treatment strategies, survival rates for children diagnosed with cancer have increased to
75% to 80%.1 Cancer itself remains the main cause of death and is followed by treatment-related death.2 Not only can the
severe adverse effects of cancer treatment lead to death, but they can also lead to morbidity, decreased quality of life, and
treatment delays.3 Supportive care focuses on the prevention and management of these adverse effects. To reduce and/or
prevent morbidity and mortality and to improve the quality of life of children with cancer and their families, it is of the
utmost importance that children receive optimal supportive care.4,5
There is an increased understanding that adherence to evidence-based clinical guidelines improves patient outcomes
as well as the general quality of care.6-8 For example, a systematic review focusing on Dutch evidence-based guidelines
showed that guideline-consistent care improved the process and structure of care.9 Within oncology, adherence to guideline recommendations for initiating antibiotic therapy in adult cancer patients with low-risk febrile neutropenia is associated with decreased mortality.10 Bridging the gap between current evidence and current practice by clinical practice
guideline implementation is a major challenge.11,12

Variations in Pediatric Supportive Care/Loeffen et al

Little is known about the variability in supportive
care practices for childhood cancer patients. Recent studies have shown that in other fields of medical practice,
such as adult oncology, neurology, and pulmonology,
major variations in daily practice exist that negatively
influence the quality of care.13-15
The aim of our study was to determine the extent of
agreement of current pediatric oncology supportive care
practices in all 6 Dutch pediatric cancer centers. Furthermore, we aimed to compare the supportive care practices
in these hospitals with strong recommendations of published high-quality, evidence-based pediatric oncology
supportive care guidelines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To evaluate the extent of agreement of current supportive
care practices, we conducted an explorative survey among
all pediatric cancer centers in the Netherlands. At each of
the 6 centers, a pediatric oncologist with supportive care
expertise provided local childhood cancer supportive care
guidelines and protocols. This study was conducted in
accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.
Topic Selection

In a previous study, we conducted a Delphi survey to prioritize childhood cancer supportive care topics for the development of clinical practice guidelines.16 To explore
variations in practice between the 6 centers, we selected
the 10 most highly prioritized topics from the final prioritization list. These were infection, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, pain, nausea and vomiting, restrictions in daily life
and activities, palliative care, procedural sedation, terminal care, and oral mucositis. For these topics, we created
relevant subtopics (eg, antibiotic prophylaxis for the topic
of infection). To do so, 2 researchers (E.A.H.L. and
W.J.E.T.) drafted a list of possible subtopics. Four topics
regarding common procedures (erythrocyte transfusion,
platelet transfusion, lumbar puncture, and central venous
access port) were added to this list. The draft list of subtopics was sent to all authors and revised on the basis of
their comments. All authors approved the final list.
For each topic, we attempted to compile 3 key
questions:
1. Who needs a certain action?
2. What action should be performed?
3. When should the action be performed?
The questions were sent to all coauthors for review
and were revised on the basis of their comments. All coauthors approved the final questions. For some topics, the 3

key questions were not applicable. Therefore, for these
topics, we limited the questions to 1 or 2 questions or formulated a different question.
Survey

From the childhood cancer supportive care guidelines and
protocols provided by the 6 pediatric oncology centers,
we extracted the local recommendations on the selected
topics to answer the questions developed previously. The
summary of local supportive care recommendations was
returned to the participating oncologist at each hospital to
verify that it corresponded with supportive care practice at
the hospital and to make adjustments as applicable. We
repeatedly emphasized that the summary list was intended
to reflect the policies and guidelines of their hospital and
not their personal preference.
Definitions and Assessment of Agreement

A topic was categorized as concordant when 5 or 6 of 6
centers reported the same practice. When practice was not
exactly the same but highly overlapping in 5 or 6 of 6 centers, the topic was characterized as partly concordant.
Topics were categorized as discordant when fewer than 5
centers reported the same practice. If a center did not have
a policy or guideline on a topic, the definitions of concordance were not altered. An assessment of agreement
between hospitals was performed by 1 researcher
(E.A.H.L.) and discussed individually and in detail with 2
other authors. Disagreements in characterization were discussed and resolved by consensus. The summary and characterizations were sent to all authors for their approval.
Conformity With Current International
Guidelines

To identify current guidelines on the topics of interest, we
asked all authors to state all contemporary, high-quality,
evidence-based childhood cancer supportive care guidelines with which they were acquainted. This yielded 4
guidelines, which addressed 2 of the prioritized topics:
fever and neutropenia and chemotherapy-induced nausea
and vomiting.17-20 Within these guidelines, we identified
strong recommendations. As defined by the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, strong recommendations indicate that the
desirable effects of the recommended intervention clearly
outweigh the undesirable effects or clearly do not.21 We
assessed the extent of agreement between these recommendations and the identified local supportive care practices with the same methods used to assess agreement in
interinstitutional supportive care practices.

RESULTS
Using the aforementioned procedure, we developed a list
of 67 questions regarding supportive care practice items.
These addressed the 14 selected topics under 13 headings
(Table 1). In all, 13 subtopics consisted of 3 questions, 6
subtopics consisted of 2 questions, and 16 subtopics consisted of 1 question. Overall, we found concordance in 11
of 67 supportive care practice items (16.4%), partial concordance in 6 of 67 practice items (9.0%), and discordance in 50 of 67 practice items (74.6%; Tables 1-3).
For 7 of the 11 concordant practice items (63.6%),
the reported practice was concordant at all 6 participating
hospitals; for 4 of 11 items (36.4%), this was the case for 5
of 6 hospitals. The majority of the concordant areas (8 of
11) were related to the question of what action should be
performed and focused on the choice of medication (5 of
8), sedation (2 of 8), or dosage (1 of 8; Tables 2 and 4).
Detailed information about the supportive care practices
of all the centers is shown in the online supporting information, information regarding easily identifiable items
(eg, numbers) is shown in Table 5.
Per-Topic Analysis

All supportive care topics had discordant areas. In infection and febrile neutropenia, the extent of agreement was
relatively high; 12 of 31 practice items (38.7%) were concordant or partly concordant. Several of these (partial)
concordances were medication-related (eg, the use of
ciprofloxacin as antibiotic prophylaxis). However, there
were also discordant practices within these topics (eg, the
use of different empirical antibiotic treatments for febrile
neutropenia). The practices within 4 topics were all discordant. For these topics, nausea and vomiting comprised
the largest number of practice items (n 5 15).
Conformity With Current International
Guidelines

We compared our findings on the management of febrile
neutropenia in children with cancer with the strong recommendations from the recent guideline by Lehrnbecher
et al.17 In their guideline, it is recommended that the empirical treatment of high-risk febrile neutropenia should
consist of monotherapy with antipseudomonal b-lactam
or carbapenem. In our study, 2 of 6 hospitals recommended initial dual therapy. Four of 6 hospitals reported
monotherapy with the recommended antibiotics. However, these hospitals suggested the addition of a second antibiotic agent under conditions that were neither
described nor recommended in the guideline by Lehrnbecher et al. On the other hand, 1 concordant practice
644

identified in our study, the prescription of amphotericin
B as antifungal therapy, was in line with Lehrnbecher
et al’s strong recommendation regarding antifungal
therapy.
In relation to nausea and vomiting, we found that all
hospitals have their own classification system regarding
the potential emetogenicity of chemotherapy. All classifications differed from the recent classification guideline by
Dupuis et al.20 For instance, in our study, in the nonemetogenic category, there was 1 chemotherapeutic agent
(procarbazine) that was classified in the guideline as highly
emetogenic and 4 chemotherapeutic agents (cyclophosphamide at < 500 mg/m2, etoposide, methotrexate at
<1 g/m2, and vinorelbine) that were classified in the
guideline as moderately emetogenic. As for prophylaxis
against acute nausea and vomiting due to antineoplastic
medication, we identified varying agreement with the
guideline by Dupuis et al. Practice was alike in 4 of 6 centers for minimally emetogenic chemotherapy, in 3 of 6
centers for chemotherapy of low emetogenicity, in 1 of 6
centers for moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, and in
0 of 6 centers for highly emetogenic chemotherapy (see
the online supporting information for details).19
DISCUSSION
Our study shows that major variations exist in daily practice in supportive care for childhood cancer across pediatric centers in the Netherlands. In this nationwide study,
75% of supportive care practice items showed discordant
practice among the participating centers. Variations in
care can lead to suboptimal treatment or conflicting recommendations, which might result in increased mortality
and morbidity in children with cancer.7 Familiarity with
and adherence to existing high-quality, evidence-based
guidelines and the development and implementation of
new clinical practice guidelines can contribute to
increased use of evidence-based medicine and a decrease
in practice variation; this might ultimately contribute to
improved outcomes for children with cancer.
This study was conducted in the Netherlands, where
approximately 550 children per year are newly diagnosed
with cancer and there are approximately 40 pediatric
oncologists.22 Because variations in care already exist on
such a geographically small scale, we also expect them to
exist on the same scale or on an even greater scale in larger
countries. Factors that have been shown to play a role in
variations in provided care include the availability of medication and supplies, the number of patients, the preferences of patients and physicians, and the availability of
evidence.10,23 In the Netherlands, the availability of

In 5 of 6 hospitals, diagnostic tests are performed after fever persists despite antibiotic
treatment; however, the timeframe and the secondary conditions vary.
In 5 of 6 hospitals, PCP prophylaxis is administered once daily 3 days a week. However, at 1
center, this is prescribed for alternating days; in all others, the days are consecutive.
All hospitals use 38.5 8C as the cutoff for fever, but types and moments of measurement vary
slightly.
In 5 of 6 hospitals, the medication scheme is 1) acetaminophen, 2) tramadol, and 3) morphine;
however, recommendations regarding NSAIDs vary slightly.
Dietary restrictions vary somewhat, but all aim at a low bacterial diet.
In 5 of 6 hospitals, there is a minimum time span of 3 h, with the maximum time span ranging
from 4 to 6 h.

substantially with the use of clinical practice guidelines.
Therefore, we expect them to play an important role in
decreasing practice variations in the Netherlands.
For some topics in childhood cancer, there are existing guidelines that are evidence-based and have been developed with a thorough and well-defined methodology.
These guidelines include 2 of our Delphi top-10 topics:
febrile neutropenia and nausea and vomiting.17-20 Surprisingly, even though good evidence-based guidelines exist, all
15 nausea and vomiting items showed discordant practice
among the participating centers. However, it should be
noted that this study was performed in the summer of
2014, before the 2015 publication of 2 important studies
that promote the use of aprepitant in children receiving
highly emetogenic chemotherapy.24,25 If the current study
was performed now with these studies published, practice
in the various centers might show a higher extent of agreement with the guideline recommendation to prescribe
aprepitant to children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.19 Thus, our results show that supportive care practices among the different centers are most often discordant
across centers but also, in the case of febrile neutropenia
and nausea and vomiting, are not in line with the strong
recommendations of current high-quality, evidence-based
guidelines. This might be due to unfamiliarity with these
guidelines, which hinders their uptake in daily practice.
Among other things, our findings underline the importance of a well-developed implementation strategy.
As for the areas with a high extent of agreement, most
practice items that were answered in a concordant manner
by the various centers focused on the question of what
action should be performed. Three of 11 concordant pracCancer

February 15, 2016

tice items focused on prophylactic medication for infections, and they were all in line with the nationwide Dutch
Childhood Oncology Group pediatric primary cancer
treatment protocols. These protocols cover primary cancer
treatment only, including prophylactic medication for
infections, and do not include dedicated supportive care
sections/protocols. Therefore, we suspect that some of the
concordances can be explained by the use of these nationally endorsed protocols. This further strengthens our idea
that guidelines decrease practice variability.
Our explorative survey-study sheds new light on current variations in daily supportive care practice for childhood cancer patients. Naturally, this study has its
limitations. First, we let 1 pediatric oncologist per center
verify our list with the extracted local practices. By asking
1 individual to provide information, we did not measure
intra-institutional variability. Nevertheless, we tried to
compensate for this by clearly asking the participating
oncologists to report institutional practice and not personal preference. In addition, we suspect that measuring
intra-institutional variability would even have increased
the documented rate of discordance. Second, we did not
validate that the reported daily practice was indeed the
actual daily practice (eg, by reviewing patient records).
Thus, differences herein might exist. However, we explicitly asked that respondents report institutional actual daily
practice and not personal preference or guideline statements that are not implemented in daily practice. Third,
there will not be an evidence base to support the answer to
every survey question. These practice items will, therefore,
be primarily based on (shared) expert opinion and local
consensus. Last, in the Netherlands, there are no

Variations in Pediatric Supportive Care/Loeffen et al

nationally endorsed supportive care guidelines for childhood cancer. In countries where these exist, practice variability might be substantially lower, although published
data to support this are lacking.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess variations in supportive care practice in childhood cancer
patients in general. Previously, there has been some attention to practice variations in this field, but it has been limited to certain subtopics. For instance, 1 study found a
wide variation in recommendations for nonpharmacological anti-infective measures in childhood cancer.26 Our
study underlines that these practice variations are not limited to specific topics but likely exist in the entire childhood cancer supportive care practice.
In an effort to bridge the gap between current evidence and current practice in supportive care, we initiated
a project entitled “Towards Evidence-Based Guidelines
for Supportive Care in Childhood Oncology.” We aim to
develop and implement clinical practice guidelines
regarding supportive care for childhood cancer patients by
using existing international guidelines and new summaries of evidence. Naturally, we feel that international collaboration in the development and implementation of
these guidelines would allow us to take full advantage of
international expertise and effort. To this end, we invite
all experts who are willing to participate in this project.
In conclusion, we found that practice for 3 of every
4 pediatric oncology supportive care practice items in
our questionnaire was discordant in our nationwide
study. In addition, practice was generally not in line
with strong recommendations from current international, high-quality, evidence-based supportive care
guidelines. Familiarity with and adherence to existing
high-quality, evidence-based guidelines and the development and implementation of new clinical practice
guidelines in daily practice have the potential to greatly
facilitate evidence-based practice and, therefore, to contribute to better outcomes in children with cancer.
FUNDING SUPPORT
The project “Towards Evidence-Based Guidelines for Supportive
Care in Childhood Oncology” is supported by the Alpe d’HuZes
Foundation/Dutch Cancer Society (RUG 2013-6345). The funding source had no role in the study design; in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data; in the preparation of the
manuscript; or in the decision to submit the manuscript for
publication.
