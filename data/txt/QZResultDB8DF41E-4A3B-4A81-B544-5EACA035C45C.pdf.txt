ABSTRACT:

The expression level of the HER family is unreliable as a predictive marker for targeted
therapies in cancer. Thus, there is a need to develop other biomarkers, which can
be used to accurately select responsive patients for targeted therapies. The HER
dimerization status may be more important than HER receptor expression per se in
determining sensitivity or resistance to a given therapeutic agent. The aim of the study
is to develop a FRET assay using dye conjugated secondary antibodies to assess HER
receptor dimerization. Using primary antibodies from different species in conjunction
with Alexa488 and Alexa546 conjugated secondary antibodies, we validated our
EGFR/HER2 dimerization assay in three cell lines, EGFR positive A431 cells as well as
HER2 positive breast cell lines BT474 and SKBR3 cells. Finally, we applied our assay to
assess EGFR/HER2 dimerization in paraffin embedded cell pellets. Our results show
promise for the assay to be applied to tumor samples in order to assess the prognostic
significance and predictive value of HER receptor dimerization in various cancers.

INTRODUCTION

of patients [9, 10]. Furthermore, such mutations are
uncommon in other cancers like HNSCC and may not
be predictive of sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in these
cancers [11]. For those cancers without EGFR mutations,
it has been shown that the expression levels of EGFR do
not predict the success of these drugs and the response
rate to these inhibitors remains poor [9, 12]. One reason
for this is that the HER receptors are able to form
alternative dimers and can therefore compensate the loss
of function of one receptor during targeted therapies [13,
14]. Thus, the HER receptor dimerization patterns may be
more important than the expression level per se in cancer
prognosis and prediction of response to targeted therapies
[15, 16]. Therefore, the ability to assess the dimerization
pairs within tumours could be useful as a prognostic or
predictive biomarker for targeted therapies in cancer.
In cell lines co-immunoprecipitation (IP) can
be used to make an assessment of HER dimerization.

Dysregulation of HER (ErbB) receptors has been
implicated in several cancers. For example, EGFR is
frequently over-expressed in Head and Neck Squamous
Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) and is correlated with poor
disease-free survival and overall survival in these patients
[1, 2]. In breast cancer, over-expression and amplification
of HER2 occurs in about 15-20% of breast cancer and
is predictive of poor outcome in these patients [3-5].
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was developed to target HER2
proteins and has been shown to increase the survival of
patients [6, 7]. However, the response rate for Herceptin
monotherapy for advanced breast cancer patients is
only around 35% and all responders eventually develop
resistance to Herceptin [8]. In lung cancers, EGFR
mutations were found to predict an excellent response to
EGFR TKIs but these are only found in a small number

However, this method is not ideal since the two HER
proteins assessed may not have interacted with each
other directly but through a tertiary protein. Assessment
of HER dimerization states in tumours has also been
proven to be difficult since the conventional method
utilizing IHC can only assess the expression levels and
their co-localization of HER receptors. For example, in
EGFR and HER2 staining, the percentage of stained cells
and their intensity allows us to assess EGFR and HER2
expression in the tumors. However, staining for both
receptors in a single sample can only reveal intercellular
co-localization but this does not provide a true indication
of their dimerization states. The same limitation applies to
intensity-based fluorescence/confocal microscopy, which
can reveal intracellular co-localization but not definitively
demonstrate the existence of HER dimers.
We hypothesized that HER dimerization could be
quantified by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)
after successfully applying the assay to assess EGFR
activation states in tissue microarrays [17]. Previously, we
conjugated primary antibodies to a pair of fluorophores.
However, such experiments often resulted in a waste of
large amount of antibodies during the primary antibody
conjugation process and thus was not economically viable.
Here we propose and test the use of a pair of commercially
available fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies
specific for different species of primary to conduct a
FRET experiment. This protocol could potentially be
applied to assess various HER receptor dimerization
and other protein interactions by varying the primary
antibodies. Our aim is to apply the assay to assess EGFR/
HER2 dimerization in HER2 positive breast tumors as
well as EGFR over-expressing tumors like HNSCC. As
a proof of principle, we have validated our assay for the
dimerization of EGFR and HER2 in 3 cell lines; HER2

positive cell lines BT474 and SKBr3 as well as EGFR
positive A431 cells, in relation to ligand stimulation and
targeted therapies. We also applied the assay to paraffinembedded cell pellets to demonstrate the robustness of
the assay and the potential clinical application to tissue
microarrays (TMA).

RESULTS
Using primary antibodies for EGFR and HER2
from two different species in conjunction with speciesspecific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa488 or
Alexa546, we first assessed the dimerization of EGFR and
HER2 in fixed cell samples. The schematic diagram is for
this labeling is shown in Figure 1. We established that there
is an advantage in utilizing the over-expressed receptor
as the FRET donor (data not shown). For example, in
EGFR over-expressing cell lines where we chose EGFR
as the donor, we used a mouse-EGFR antibody with an
anti-mouse Alexa488 secondary antibody. HER2 would
be the acceptor, so we would use a rabbit-HER2 antibody
with an anti-rabbit Alexa546 secondary antibody. It was
hypothesized that upon ligand simulation, there would be
an increase in EGFR/HER2 dimerization and thus FRET
between the two conjugated flurophores, The overlap in
the donor (Alexa488) emission spectrum and acceptor
(Alexa546) absorption spectrum allows FRET to occur,
resulting in a decrease of donor fluorescence lifetime,
indicative of EGFR/HER2 dimerization (Figure 1). In
HER2 over-expressing cell lines, we used a rabbit-HER2
antibody with an anti-rabbit Alexa488 secondary antibody
as donor and a mouse-EGFR antibody with an anti-mouse
Alexa546 secondary antibody as acceptor to assess EGFR/
HER2 dimerization by FRET.
To show in-situ that EGFR/HER2 dimerization could

be monitored by our assay, BT474 cells were stimulated
with HER ligands, either EGF or heregulin as well as
by an EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Iressa.
Firstly, we stained unstimulated BT474 cells with only
the primary rabbit-HER2 antibody and the correlating
anti-rabbit Alexa488 secondary antibody (as described
in Materials and Methods). The lifetime measured in this
sample gives us the fluorescence lifetime of Alexa 488,
which was shown to have a mean value of approximately
2.35 ns (Figure 2A). When the cells were stained with both
the primary antibodies (anti-HER2 and anti-EGFR) as
well as the appropriate species-specific labeled secondary
antibodies, we found a statistically significant decrease in
fluorescence donor lifetime to around 2.25 ns (P<0.025)
compared to that with the donor alone (Figure 2A),
suggesting the existence of a basal level of EGFR/HER2
dimerization, as confirmed by immunoprecipitation and
western blot (Figure 2D).
When BT474 cells were treated with EGF, there
was a further decrease in donor lifetime to 2.12 ns
which is statistically significant compared to the result
from unstimulated cells (P<0.025) (Figure 2A), which
correlated with the higher amount of EGFR-HER2
dimerization seen in IP (Figure 2D). As a negative control,

BT474 cells were stimulated with heregulin (HRG), which
induces dimerization of HER3 and HER4, with their
preferred dimerization partner HER2 [18]. Therefore,
this might be seen to decrease EGFR/HER2 dimerization
(Figure 2A), which was confirmed by IP (Figure 2D). To
further demonstrate the specificity of our assay, another
negative control was used. EGFR specific tyrosine kinase
inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa), which was shown to decrease
basal EGFR/HER2 dimerization (Figure 2D), produced
an increase in donor fluorescence lifetime when compared
to that of untreated cells (P<0.005) (Figure 2A). A visual
representation of the distribution of fluorescence lifetimes
across typical cells, using a pseudo-colour display,
ranging from 1.40 – 3.00 ns, is shown in Figure 2C. The
image for EGF treated cells shows almost entirely ‘blue’
pixels compared to the blue/yellow combination seen in
the control, or yellow/green combination in HRG and
Iressa treated cells. Each image is accompanied by a
graphical representation of these lifetimes. In the case of
EGF-treated cells, this distribution is seen to shift towards
lower lifetimes, compared to the control or HRG and
Iressa treated cells.
Figure 2B represents fluorescence images of these
cells with HER2 shown in green and EGFR in yellow.

A. BT474 cells were stimulated with different ligands, EGF and HRG (both 100ng/ml for 10 min) or pre-treated with Iressa 1µM for 1 hour

before being fixed for FRET experiments (see Methods). Analysis was performed globally across each group of cells using a bi-exponential
fit and interpreting the slower component as the fluorescence lifetime (See Supplementary Figure 1) (n=20 for each condition) B. Panels of
fluorescence microscopy images are shown for each of these conditions illustrating EGFR (lower panels) and HER2 (upper panels) receptor
localization. C. As in A, a bi-exponential fit and the slow components were used. Here, fits were performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis and
used to generate pseudo-colour fluorescence lifetime images, with a scale from 1.4 ns to 3.0 ns, showing the distribution of fluorescence
lifetimes across the cells. The corresponding histograms are generated from the relative frequency of lifetimes across this range thus
showing the shifts that occur between treatment conditions. D. Co-immunoprecipitation blots for EGFR and HER2 on BT474 cell lysate

As can be seen here, the shortcoming of fluorescence
images, and that of confocal images, is that only colocalization of receptors can be suggested rather than
true interactions. However, in combination with donor
lifetime determinations, we could conclude whether the
dimerization of EGFR/HER2 has indeed occurred (Figure
2A).
We also validated our assay in another HER2 positive
breast cell lines SKBr3 cells treated with different targeted
therapies (Figure 3A). We showed that Iressa decreased
basal EGFR/HER2 dimerization as shown by an increase
of donor lifetime compared to basal level (Figure 3A
and 3B). Pertuzumab specifically blocks dimerization of
HER2 by binding to domain II and sterically preventing

association with other receptors [19], and thus is an ideal
control to validate our assay. As seen in figure 3A, and
supported by immunoprecipitation (Figure 3B), 1 hour
pre-treatment with Pertuzumab resulted in an increase in
donor fluorescence lifetime, returning the lifetime to be
in line with the donor alone control lifetime. This implies
that dimerization is prevented between EGFR and HER2,
which is consistent with the mode of action.
In the EGFR positive A431 cell line, a mouse
anti-EGFR antibody was used as the primary antibody,
with specific anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled to
Alexa488 and anti-rabbit HER2 primary antibody coupled
with an Alexa546-secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Figure
1). Figure 3D showed that A431 cells stained with donor

and acceptor compared to donor alone gave significantly
lower lifetimes, indicative of the basal EGFR/HER2
dimerization in these cells (Figure 3C and 3D). To
show that our assay is sensitive to detect the changes in
EGFR/HER2 dimerization, we stimulated the cells with
increased doses of EGF and assessed the donor lifetimes.
Figure 3D shows that application of a low dose of EGF
produces a smaller decrease in donor lifetime compared to
the higher dose. The converse was shown to be true with
increasing doses of Iressa, which decreased EGFR/HER2
dimerization (Figure 3D). These changes in fluorescence
lifetime correspond to dimerization as assessed by
immunoprecipitation (Figure 3C), thus demonstrating the
sensitivity of our assay in detecting changes in EGFR/
HER2 dimerization in response to different doses of
ligand stimulation and drug treatment.
To assess whether we could apply the assay to
assess EGFR/HER2 dimerization in TMAs, we needed
to demonstrate its sensitivity to detect EGFR/HER2
dimerization changes in paraffin-embedded cell pellets.

Thus, we applied the assay to A431 paraffin-embedded
cell pellets of different pre-treatment conditions. We
performed the assay using anti-EGFR antibody as primary
antibody with the correct secondary labeled antibody as
the FRET donor. The decrease in fluorescence lifetime
for the donor and acceptor control sample suggested a
degree of basal dimerization, which was significantly
increased when treated with EGF (Figure 4A). However,
when treated with pertuzumab (2C4), the fluorescence
lifetime was seen to increase, in a manner similar to
that in fixed cell experiment samples (Figure 4A). The
EGFR/HER2 dimerization patterns correlated with the
immunoprecipitation results (Figure 4B). As can be seen
from the fluorescence images, we could only conclude
whether EGFR receptors (upper panels, green) colocalized with HER2 receptors (lower panels, yellow)
without the lifetime data (Figure 4C). However, our FRET
assay could detect changes in EGFR/HER2 dimerization
(Figure 4A). In combination with the fluorescence images,
we could detect HER receptor dimerization at cellular

technique has the additional advantage of lower cost and
thus potentially wider application to assess various protein
interactions, compared with the primary conjugation
approach.
Using the FRET technique, we are able to image the
FRET process in single cells, establishing heterogeneity
within the sample and are therefore able to identify trends,
which might otherwise be overlooked in techniques that
combine protein from many cells for analysis. Further
to this, heterogeneity in dimerization within a single cell
can be identified and thus the potential exists to explore
the role of cellular compartmentalization HER signaling,
which has been demonstrated to have great significance in
acquired resistance to targeted therapies [24]. We believe
that this assay has the potential to act as a prognostic
test in HER2 and EGFR positive breast cancer although
much more validation work is required. For example, it
is well known that fluorescence lifetimes are affected by
a multitude of factors (e.g. temperature, pH, oxygenation
status etc.) [22, 23] and these may become limiting when
small FRET-induced lifetime changes are to be determined.
In the experiments described here this does not seem to
be the case as experimental and preparation conditions
were tightly controlled. Furthermore, application to
paraffin-embedded patient tissue material remains to be
validated; it may be challenging due to the presence of
other fluorophores (e.g. endogenous auto-fluorescence),
but the use of FRET fluorophores in the far-red portion
of the spectrum may alleviate this. Suitably sensitive
single photon counting detectors operating in the far-red
are becoming available and could thus be applied. These
assays may allow us to answer some of the unresolved
questions regarding the unpredictable outcome of the
currently available targeted treatments, such as Herceptin,
and the role of HER dimerization in drug resistance.

DISCUSSION
Here, we present a proof-of-principle study
demonstrating that we could use a pair of secondary
antibodies from different species, conjugated to a pair
of suitable FRET flurophores to assess EGFR/HER2
dimerization in human cell lines. This assay could be used
to assess other HER dimerization pairings by changing the
primary antibodies while using the same pair of flurophoreconjugated secondary antibodies. We demonstrated the
sensitivity and specificity of the assay in detecting EGFR/
HER2 dimerization in cell lines stimulated or treated with
different doses of ligands and drugs. Most importantly,
the assay is potentially applicable to tissue microarrays,
as demonstrated by its effectiveness in paraffin-embedded
cell pellet preparations. This will allow the dimerization
states of tumor cells to be assessed in-situ. Thus, the assay
can be assessed for its prognostic and predictive values in
a clinical setting.
It has been claimed that assays other than FRET have
the ability to assess protein interaction and specifically
HER dimerization. These are based on the ligation
of proteins, including Vera Tag [20] and Proximity
Ligation Assay (PLA), which utilized DNA ligation [21].
However, none of these techniques can truly prove protein
interaction although they can suggest it. Ligation assays
can give positive results at a distance between substrates
of 30-40 nm, which we would argue is very conclusive for
confirming co-localization but not dimerization. Among
all the techniques however, FRET is regarded as the gold
standard technique to assess protein interaction since the
distance between the determinants is <10 nm rather than
30-40 nm for both Vera Tag and proximity ligation assays
[20-22]. Although there are many ways of determining
FRET, methods based on the use of FLIM are the most
sensitive in their ability to determine small changes in
interaction distance and can thus be used as the basis for
highly sensitive assays [22, 23]. The inverse sixth power
distance dependence of FRET confers sensitivity to this
assay, and the Förster Distance, at which half maximal
FRET efficiency occurs, is typically ∼5 nm [22, 23].
FRET induced changes in fluorescence lifetime are thus
likely to represent direct interaction between receptors
and have the potential advantage of accurately reflecting
the dimerization of the receptors. It could be argued that
by using the secondary antibody technique, we have
increased the distance between the fluorophores and
interfere with their interaction. This will decrease FRET
efficiency and thus reduce the assay sensitivity. Therefore,
it is possible that an even greater FRET efficiency would
have been observed if primary conjugation was used.
However, we have demonstrated our assay to be sensitive
and specific in assessing EGFR/HER2 dimerization assay
in various cell lines. Furthermore, the secondary antibody

ER, Hamamatsu Photonics) at 160 nm/pixel resolution.
To image Alexa 488 fluorescence a ‘FITC’ filter set was
used (Excitation: 465-495 nm, Emission: 515-555 nm)
and to image Alexa 546 a ‘TRITC’ filter set was used
(Excitation: 528-552 nm, Emission 578-632 nm). The
sample was illuminated and imaged through a 40x, 1.3 NA
objective lens (Nikon S Fluor oil) in an epi-illumination
configuration. For FRET analysis, pixel-by-pixel lifetime
determination was utilised. The FLIM images were
obtained and the outputs files consist of all the fitting
parameters recorded for each image. These data can be
analyzed to produce distinct lifetimes or a distribution of
lifetimes across the image. The secondary conjugation
preparation gives two separate fluorescence lifetimes.
Thus, a bi-exponential fluorescence model was used to fit
the data using in-house exponential fitting software (TRI2)
utilising a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [25], modified
to derive the maximum likelihood estimate [25], with
the larger value interpreted as that of the Alexa 488 dye
(Supplementary Figure 1). Pseudo-colour fluorescence
lifetime maps were also produced using TRI2 [26] .

Förster Resonance Energy Transfer experiments
Approximately, 30,000 cells were seeded onto cover
slips in a 24-well plate and left to settle overnight. Cells
were treated with drugs or ligands for specific times at
37 °C in culture media. After treatment, the staining
protocol was performed at room temperature. Cells were
washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(Pierce) in PBS for 10 minutes, then permeabilized
with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 5
minutes before treatment for 10 minutes with 1 mg/ml
sodium borohydride (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS to quench
the background fluorescence. Between steps, cells were
washed twice with PBS. After quenching the background
fluorescence, a blocking step was performed for 1 hour
using 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. After blocking,
primary antibodies (1:200 in blocking buffer) were added
and allowed to bind for 2.5 hours. Cells were washed
twice with PBS and Alexa-488 or Alexa-546 conjugated
secondary antibodies (mouse or rabbit) (1:400 in blocking
buffer) added for 90 minutes. Cells were washed twice
with PBS and twice with water before mounting the
cover slips on a microscope slide using Fluoromount-G
(Southern Biotech).
For the cell pellet studies, 107 A431 cells were
embedded in paraffin. Embedded pellets were sliced
by microtome and de-waxed. Antigen retrieval was
performed, after which the protocol was used as described
above.

Immunoprecipitation
A431, BT474 and SKBR3 cells were grown to
near confluence before lysis. Lysate was centrifuged
for 10 minutes at maximum speed at 4°C and protein
quantification was performed on the supernatant.
Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Bio-Nobile) were
incubated with biotin-conjugated HER2 or F4 antibodies
(Conjugation Kit, Innova Biosciences) for two hours at
room temperature [13]. After that, the bead-antibody
complex was incubated with supernatant containing equal
amounts of protein for 2 hours at room temperature. Bead
complexes were collected and washed three times with
PBS-Tween (0.2%). Next, 50 µl of 4× SDS with 10%
β-mercaptoethanol was added to the bead complexes.
Complexes were boiled for 10 min at 95 °C to elute protein
from the beads. Samples were run on a SDS gel at 130 V.
Proteins were transferred to a membrane using a semi-dry
transfer at 12V for 2 hours. Membrane was blocked with 3%
BSA in PBS-Tween (0.2%) for 1 hour. Primary antibodies
were administered for 3 hours at room temperature in the
blocking solution, followed by 4 washes with 1% milk
in PBS-Tween. Secondary antibodies were added in 5%
milk in PBS-Tween for an hour at room temperature. Four
washes in 1% milk in PBS-Tween were performed before
visualizing antibodies by an enhanced chemiluminescent
(ECL) detection system (GE Healthcare).

Fluorescence Lifetime Microscopy (FLIM)
FLIM and wide field fluorescence imaging were
performed using a custom-built inverted microscope
system operating in the single-photon excitation regime.
FLIM was performed with excitation from a pulsed (∼4
ps pulse width) super continuum laser source (SC450-M,
Fianium Ltd., UK) operating at a repetition rate of 80 MHz
and an optical filter set consisting of an excitation filter
(Semrock FF01-470/22), dichromatic reflector (Semrock
FF495Di02) and an emission filter (Semrock FF01520/35) and a custom built laser scanning system. Emitted
fluorescence light from the sample was collected through
the emission filter by a photomultiplier tube (PMH-1000, Becker & Hickl GmbH, Germany) in the de-scanned
laser path and fluorescence lifetime information collected
by a time-correlated single photon counting PCI board
(SPC830, Becker & Hickl GmbH, Germany). Wide field
fluorescence images were obtained with illumination from
a metal halide arc lamp (Lumen200, Prior Ltd., UK) and
