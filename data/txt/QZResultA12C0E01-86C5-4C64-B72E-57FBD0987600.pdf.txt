BACKGROUND: Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is 1 of the most powerful prognostic factors for
extremity osteosarcoma. [F-18]-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a noninvasive imaging modality that is used to predict histopathologic response. To determine the prognostic
value of FDG-PET response for progression-free survival (PFS) in osteosarcoma, the authors of this report
reviewed the University of Washington Medical Center experience. METHODS: Forty patients with extremity osteosarcoma were evaluated by FDG-PET. All patients received neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. FDG-PET standard uptake values (SUVs) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (SUV1) and after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (SUV2) were analyzed and correlated with histopathologic response. RESULTS:
The median SUV1 was 6.8 (range, 3.0-24.1), the median SUV2 was 2.3 (range, 1.2-12.8), and the median
SUV2 to SUV1 ratio (SUV2:1), was 0.36 (range, 0.12-1.10). A good FDG-PET response was defined as anSUV2
<2.5 or an SUV2:1 0.5. FDG-PET responses according to SUV2 and SUV2:1 were concordant with histologic response in 58% and 68% of patients, respectively. SUV2 was associated with outcome (4-year PFS,
73% for SUV2 <2.5 vs 39% for SUV2 2.5; P ¼ .021). Both the initial disease stage and the histologic
response were associated with outcome. CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET imaging of extremity osteosarcoma
was correlated only partially with a histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. An SUV2 <2.5 was
associated with improved PFS. Future prospective studies are warranted to determine whether FDG-PET
imaging may be used as a predictor of outcome independent of initial disease stage. Cancer

resulting in a 60% to 70% progression-free survival (PFS)
rate for children with localized disease.2-7 In addition to
facilitating limb-sparing resection, neoadjuvant chemotherapy allows radiographic and histologic assessment of
the efficacy of chemotherapy. Histologic response, measured by the percentage of viable tumor cells that remain
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy,8,9 has prognostic value
in predicting PFS.9,10 If a favorable response to therapy is
anticipated, then limb-sparing surgical resection may be
more feasible.5,11 However, osteosarcoma usually does
not change significantly in size in response to chemotherapy, making computed tomography (CT) scanning or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) insensitive methods
with which to determine chemotherapy responsiveness.12
Instead, a noninvasive surrogate marker of histologic
response would be useful to assess the efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy.
[F-18]-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose
(FDG)-positron
emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging
method with the potential to assess tumor response to
chemotherapy. Malignant cells avidly take up and retain
FDG, a glucose analog. We previously reported the correlation between FDG-PET changes and histologic
response in patients with pediatric Ewing sarcoma family
of tumors (ESFT) and osteosarcoma.13 We also reported
an association between the reduction in the standard
uptake value (SUV) and outcome after neoadjuvant doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy in patients with extremity soft tissue sarcomas14 and ESFT.15 To determine
the value of FDG-PET response for predicting outcome
in patients with extremity osteosarcoma, we reviewed the
experience at our center with both pediatric patients and
young adult patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

and Radiation Safety in accordance with institutional and
federal guidelines. All eligible patients with extremity osteosarcoma who received treatment at SCH or UWMC
between July 1, 1995 and August 1, 2004 underwent evaluation by FDG-PET imaging. This series included 38
patients who received both chemotherapy and surgery at
SCH or UWMC and 2 patients who were referred to
SCH for surgical resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy at other institutions. Patients who did not have FDGPET studies both before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Patients underwent PET imaging
no more than 1 week before the initiation of chemotherapy. All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
including cisplatin and doxorubicin, in most cases with
the addition of high-dose methotexate.4 Other treatment
regimens included combined cisplatin, doxorubicin, and
ifosfamide16 and combined cisplatin, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and high-dose methotrexate.4 One course of therapy was defined as a treatment cycle of doxorubicincontaining chemotherapy with or without high-dose
methotrexate. PET imaging was repeated after the induction course of chemotherapy and before surgical resection.
Although the timing of the second FDG-PET study was
not standardized, 30 patients (75%) had repeat imaging
after 2 courses of chemotherapy. Histologic response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy was evaluated based on the
grading system published by Salzer-Kuntschik et al for osteosarcoma.9 For each patient, the percentage of viable tumor (calculated from multiple samples from the resected
bone and surrounding soft tissue specimen) was used to
determine the percentage of viable tumor cells using
standard histopathologic analysis. A favorable response to
chemotherapy was defined as 10% viable tumor cells,
and an unfavorable response to chemotherapy was defined
as >10% viable tumor cells. All patients (or parents for
minors) provided written informed consent.

Patient Population
We analyzed patients who presented to the Seattle Children’s Hospital (SCH) or the University of Washington
Medical Center (UWMC) with extremity osteosarcoma
who were enrolled prospectively in a study of FDG-PET
in sarcomas. All patients (or parents for minors) provided
written informed consent for participation in the PET
study and medical record review, as approved by the
UWMC Institutional Review Boards of Human Subjects

Positron Emission Tomography Imaging
Detailed methods for PET imaging in patients with sarcoma have been published previously.17,18 Briefly,
patients fasted for at least 2 hours before imaging. Patients
received from 7 millicuries (mCi) to 10 mCi of FDG
intravenously over 2 minutes. Blood glucose levels were
recorded in 30 of 40 patients before the administration of
FDG and was <120 mg/dL in all patients. Intrapatient

blood glucose levels before injection of FDG varied by
<20% in 24 of 30 patients. After a 45-minute equilibration period during which the patient rested, both emission
scans and transmission scans were obtained to generate
attenuation-corrected images over the known tumor site
using a GE Advance Positron Tomograph (General Electric, Waukesha, Wis). Typically, the tumor extent was captured in 2 adjacent 15-cm fields of view. Reconstructed
data were rendered into 3-dimensional images using a Hanning filter at a resolution of 4.2 mm. The 3-dimensional
image sets were available for review in slice thicknesses
from 4.2 mm to 12 mm. Regions of interest for the determination of tumor SUV were then hand drawn around the
area of tumor uptake using plain film, MRI, and CT scans
as references. The FDG-PET image was inspected visually
for heterogeneity in tumor uptake. The tumor SUV was
calculated automatically by the tomograph software, and,
after careful assessment of the SUV values throughout the
tumor, the maximum tumor SUV, rather than the average
SUV, was recorded for analysis. SUV1 was defined as the
maximal SUV obtained before neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
SUV2 was defined as the maximal SUV obtained after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and SUV2:1 was defined as the ratio of SUV2 to SUV1.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis of PFS was performed using the KaplanMeier method for calculating survival curves and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).19 PFS was defined as the time from
initial diagnosis to either disease progression or death from
any cause. Patients who had not developed progression or
had not died were censored at the date of last contact. Differences in PFS among groups defined by patient or treatment characteristics were analyzed using the log-rank test.20
PFS data were analyzed as of June 17, 2008 using SPSS for
Windows version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
The clinical characteristics of all 40 patients with osteosarcoma are presented in Table 1. Included in this series were
clinical and histologic response data from 8 previously
reported patients.13 All patients underwent surgical resection of their primary tumor. Thirty patients had an SUV2
obtained <2 weeks before surgery. Only 5 patients

demonstrated that improved PFS was associated with
nonmetastatic disease at initial diagnosis and with an
SUV2 <2.5 for all patients (Fig. 1). However, when the
patients with metastatic disease were excluded, the difference in PFS according to SUV2 was not statistically significant (Fig. 2). Neither an SUV1 >6 nor an SUV2:1 0.5
was associated with PFS among all patients or among
patients with localized disease only (Table 4). A strong
trend toward improved PFS was observed with favorable a

metastases at diagnosis were excluded, a favorable histologic response had a modest trend toward improved PFS
(4-year PFS rate, 78% vs 56%; P ¼ .18).

DISCUSSION
Histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is 1 of
the strongest prognostic factors for osteosarcoma.3-7,10
Histologic response has significant limitations, including
the ability to assess only once and only after 10 to 15
weeks of initial chemotherapy. We have reported the utility of FDG-PET imaging as a noninvasive method for
assessing the response13 to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
and for predicting the probability of recurrence for soft
tissue sarcomas14,21 and ESFT.15 The current report
expands on our previous series of pediatric bone sarcomas13 with 32 additional patients, including adults, and
reveals an association between SUV2 and PFS for extremity osteosarcoma. In contrast to our observation in ESFT,
SUV2 did not maintain prognostic significance when
patients with metastatic disease were excluded from the
analysis.15 However, neither categorization of response
(histologic or FDG-PET) was completely predictive of
patient outcome in our dataset. We previously reported
an association between an SUV1 >622 and SUV2:1 in
soft tissue sarcomas.14 Neither association was observed in
the current cohort of patients with osteosarcoma. We preCancer

viously observed an increase in SUV2 over SUV1 in 22%
of patients with soft tissue sarcoma.14 In contrast, only
3% of our patients with osteosarcoma experienced an
increase in SUV2 over SUV1 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, illustrating that FDG-PET imaging characteristics may be histology-specific.
To our knowledge, the current report is the first to
describe an association between FDG-PET imaging and
PFS for extremity osteosarcoma. Our analysis clearly is
limited by its relatively small sample size. The association
between SUV2 and PFS will need confirmation in a
larger, prospective study, particularly to determine
whether an SUV2 <2.5 is associated with improved PFS
in patients with localized osteosarcoma. The difference in
predictive value of SUV2 in patients with localized osteosarcoma versus patients with ESFT15 suggests that FDGPET may be less useful in patients with osteosarcoma.
Our small study population also prevents a multivariate
analysis of other potential prognostic factors, such as tumor site and size.5 Another limitation of our study is the
diversity of treatment characteristics (including neoadjuvant chemotherapy duration) of the study population.
Minor differences in chemotherapy regimens or surgery
may have influenced patient outcome, confounding the
predictive value of FDG-PET.

study was less robust than in our prior combined analysis
of pediatric patients with bone sarcoma.13 We previously
speculated15 on the potential explanations for the discordance between SUV2 and histologic assessments of
response, including nonspecific (but bioenergetically
intense) inflammatory response and scarring around necrotic tumor. Histologic response is an averaged assessment in a representative plane, in contrast to the 3dimensional assessment of maximal remaining tumor activity measured by FDG-PET. It is likely that histologic
and FDG-PET assessments of response are evaluating a
similar biologic process (residual tumor cells after therapy) but with different methodological limitations, generating related but nonconcordant results.
The optimal timing of FDG-PET to determine
response remains to be defined. Changes in FDG metabolism can occur within 24 hours after administration of
imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors23 and within
3 to 5 days after administration of AP23573, an inhibitor
of the mammalian target of rapamycin, in osteosarcoma
and other sarcomas.24 We previously reported a preliminary analysis of a prospective study of patients with highgrade soft tissue sarcoma by obtaining FDG-PET imaging
after 6 weeks (2 courses) of therapy and correlating the
results with those obtained immediately before surgery
(after 4 courses), suggesting that FDG-PET imaging
changes are apparent after only 2 courses and that FDGPET imaging results after 2 and 4 courses of therapy
essentially are concordant.21 Currently, we are conducting
2 prospective studies with FDG-PET imaging after only 1
course of treatment to explore the rapidity of FDG metabolism change in soft tissue and bone sarcomas. The Children’s Oncology Group also is performing a similar study
in patients with intermediate-risk rhabdomyosarcoma
(ARST0531) to assess FDG-PET response after 3 weeks
of chemotherapy.
FDG-PET may have several potential clinical uses.
First, orthopedic oncologists may be able to identify
patients who are more likely to have a favorable histologic
response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Such patients
would be candidates for less aggressive limb-sparing resections. Patients predicted to have an unfavorable histologic
response could be considered for more aggressive local
surgery. However, our current data suggest that SUV2 is
weakly correlated with histologic response. In contrast,
the SUV2:1 was more useful, particularly in identifying
3524

patients with poor histologic response. Second, chemotherapy-resistant osteosarcoma may be identified earlier
in the neoadjuvant period by an unfavorable FDG-PET
response, leading to an alteration in systemic chemotherapy. The success of FDG-PET–guided therapy modification assumes that FDG-PET imaging changes occur early
in treatment (as discussed above) and that alteration of
systemic chemotherapy will improve the outcome of
chemotherapy-resistant osteosarcoma. Nonrandomized
clinical trials have suggested that augmentation of chemotherapy in response to a poor histologic response can
improve outcome.7,25 However, others have refuted that
observation.6,26 The current European and American Osteosarcoma Study Group (EURAMOS) trial EURAMOS-1 addresses the benefit of response-adapted therapy
with the randomized comparison of continued, standard
adjuvant chemotherapy versus standard adjuvant chemotherapy with the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide. It
is possible that response-adapted chemotherapy would be
more successful if FDG-PET was able to identify chemotherapy-resistant osteosarcoma after only 3 to 5 weeks of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy rather than after 10 weeks of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 4 weeks of adjuvant
chemotherapy (which was used in the EURAMOS-1
trial). Finally, FDG-PET may be a surrogate marker of
response for patients who have recurrent disease or nonresectable metastases, such as ay distant bone sites. This
would be particularly useful in phase 2 studies, in which
unidimensional or bidimensional measurements of
response may underestimate the activity of a novel chemotherapy agent. The lack of a radiographic response yet the
clear clinical benefit associated with FDG metabolic
response to imatinib in the treatment of gastrointestinal
stromal tumors clearly illustrates the limitations of anatomic imaging to assess response in sarcomas.
In summary, an SUV2 <2.5 after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy for osteosarcoma was associated with an
improved PFS. The association was less robust than we
observed with ESFT and lost statistical significance when
patients with metastatic osteosarcoma were excluded. In
our small series, neither SUV2 nor histologic response
were precisely predictive of PFS. A larger prospective
study will be required to determine whether FDG-PET
imaging can complement histologic response as a prognostic factor for osteosarcoma and determine whether
FDG-PET is a prognostic factor independent of initial

timing FDG-PET and modification of treatment for
patients who are at greater risk for disease recurrence.
