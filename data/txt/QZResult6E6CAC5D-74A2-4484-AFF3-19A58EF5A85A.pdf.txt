The therapeutic potential of arsenic derivatives has long been recognized and was recently rediscovered in modern literature. Early
studies demonstrated impressive activity of this compound in patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Over the
last 2 decades, intravenous arsenic trioxide has been used successfully, both alone and in combination with other agents, for the
treatment of APL and, with some success, of other myeloid neoplasms. Arsenic trioxide is currently part the standard of care for
patients with APL. More recently, oral formulations of this compound have been developed and are entering clinical practice. In this
review, the authors discuss the evolution of arsenic in the treatment of APL and other myeloid neoplasms. Cancer 2016;122:1160-8.

INTRODUCTION
Arsenic derivatives have been identified as compounds with therapeutic potential for over 2000 years in Greek and Chinese medicine. The first evidence of the efficacy of arsenic in leukemia was reported in 1882.1 In the 1990s, researchers
from China demonstrated complete clinical remissions in approximately 66% of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who received arsenic and a survival rate of 60% at 7 years.2 At the same time, it was demonstrated that arsenic
trioxide (As2O3 [ATO]) induced apoptosis in APL cells through modulation of the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid
receptor-a (PML-RARa) protein.3
The combination of ATO and oral all-trans retinoic acid (tretinoin [ATRA]) currently constitutes the standard of
care for most patients with newly diagnosed and/or relapsed APL. The use of ATO has also been explored in many other
hematologic malignancies. Because ATO can be part of induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy for most of
these patients but is administered intravenously for long periods of time, there is a need for an alternative, more convenient
oral route of administration of this drug. In this review, we discuss the impact of ATO in the treatment of APL and other
myeloid neoplasms and the development of oral formulations of arsenic.
PHARMACOLOGY OF ATO
Mechanism of Action

The antineoplastic properties of ATO were first discovered in studies of APL, where this agent demonstrated impressive
activity. Almost all cases of APL are characterized by the hallmark cytogenetic lesion t(15;17), which generates the fusion
gene PML-RARa.4
Physiologically, heterodimers of RARa and its cofactor, retinoid X receptor (RXR), bind to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) within the promoter regions of target genes. In the absence of retinoic acid ligands, such binding results in
the recruitment of corepressor complexes and the repression of transcriptional activity. PML is a component of PML nuclear bodies, protein-based nuclear structures that are involved in transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, cellular senescence,
and DNA repair.5
PML-RARa essentially acts as an aberrant RARa, in that it can oligomerize with RXR or other transcription factors
and recruit corepressors, ultimately resulting in the transcriptional suppression of genes that are critically important for

granulocytic differentiation.6 At therapeutic concentrations, ATRA binds the ligand-binding domain of PMLRARa and induces a conformational change in the oncoprotein structure, thus relieving the transcriptional
suppression.7
In 2002 the US Food and Drug Administration
approved ATO for the treatment of relapsed/refractory
APL. Multiple mechanisms of action have been invoked
to explain the activity of ATO in APL, including induction of differentiation and apoptosis, inhibition of cell
proliferation, and antiangiogenic effects.8 At higher concentrations (0.5-2.0 mmol/L), ATO predominantly induces apoptosis; whereas, at lower concentrations (0.10.5 mmol/L), it promotes differentiation.9 ATO-mediated
apoptosis is mediated by its down-regulation of the
human telomerase gene (hTERT).10 Its antiangiogenic
effects may be caused by the inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor.8 ATRA and ATO synergistically
interfere with the activity of PML-RARa, restoring gene
transcription.11 However, unlike ATRA, ATO has demonstrated the ability to eradicate leukemia-initiating cells
in murine APL models.

formulation were 99% and 87% of those of the intravenous formulation, respectively.14
Another oral arsenic-derivative is tetra-arsenic tetrasulfide (As4S4). Realgar is a mined ore that mainly contains As4S4 (90%) as well as other types of arsenite, arsenic
trioxide, and other minerals. High-purity As4S4 obtained
from crystallized realgar was mixed with equal amounts of
ground Seman platycladi as an excipient to shape capsules.
The pharmacokinetics of this compound were analyzed in
7 patients with APL who achieved complete remission
(CR) by using a single dose of As4S4. Arsenic was detected
in the blood 30 minutes after oral administration and
peaked at 3.4 6 1.4 hours. There was wide interpatient
variation in both the AUC and half-life of the drug.
Greater than 90% of the molecule was eliminated in the
urine within 72 hours, and all of it was eliminated within
96 hours.15
Because ATO is predominantly excreted through
the kidneys, patients with renal dysfunction have
increased exposure to ATO. Experiences in patients with
severe kidney disease are anecdotal.16 It is noteworthy that
ATO crosses the blood-brain barrier (achieving 15%30% of plasma levels) when administered intravenously
or orally.

Pharmacokinetics

When administered intravenously, ATO is bound almost
entirely to hemoglobin and quickly leaves the circulation
to reach peripheral tissues. It tends to accumulate in hair,
nails, liver, lungs, heart, and kidneys. Its terminal half-life
is 12 6 3 hours.9 ATO is methylated in the body and
excreted in the kidneys.12 Continuous infusion of ATO
does not appear to cause accumulation in plasma9 and
results in higher intracellular concentrations and rates of
apoptosis, but reduced induction of differentiation, compared with daily 3-hour infusions.13
Oral ATO powder is not well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and causes significant gastrointestinal discomfort in most patients. Moreover, it is poorly soluble in
water. To improve bioavailability, > 99% pure As2O3
powder was mixed with sterile water and subsequently dissolved by adding 3 M sodium hydroxide. Finally, 6 M hydrochloric acid and diluted hydrochloric acid plus sterile
water were added to the solution and titrated to obtain a
final pH of 7.2 and an ATO concentration of 1 mg/mL.
In a pharmacokinetic study, 9 patients with relapsed APL
received 10 mg of ATO intravenously on Day 1 followed
by a 10-mg oral ATO solution daily starting on Day 2.
Although intravenous ATO reached higher peak plasma
levels, the mean plasma and blood area under the plasma
drug concentration-time curve (AUC) values of the oral

Toxicity

In clinical studies conducted among patients with APL,
the most common cause of death during induction was
severe central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage, caused
in large part by underlying disease-related coagulopathy.
The second most frequent cause of death was APL differentiation syndrome, which was related to therapy despite
prophylactic cytoreductive therapy for patients who developed leukocytosis. With regard to cardiac toxicity,
although it is known that ATO prolongs the QTC interval, cardiac arrhythmia was responsible for death in a minority of patients. In addition, electrolyte imbalances
and/or other drugs with QTC-prolonging potential might
have played a role in cardiac deaths in those studies.17
Liver toxicity was described in approximately 33% of
patients but led to treatment discontinuation in <10%
(for a review, see Au and Kwong17).
INTRAVENOUS ATO IN APL
Relapsed Disease

Early studies of ATO in patients with relapsed APL conducted in Asia reported high CR rates, with an estimated 5year rate survival > 90%.2 ATO was subsequently tested
more systematically in patients with relapsed APL. In general, these were nonrandomized studies in which patients
1161

Review Article

received ATO intravenously (10 mg or 0.15 mg/kg daily)
until CR or up to 60 days. Anthracyclines or hydroxyurea
were added for leukocytosis. Taken together, these studies
included >300 patients. Objective responses were observed
in 73% to 100% of patients, and 85% of responders
achieved CR. The median time to remission was variable
(range, 30-59 days), as was the rate of CR among patients
who had undetectable PML/RARa transcripts (molecular
CR).18 Postremission strategies varied across studies: most
patients received up to 5 additional courses of ATO-based
therapy, and some proceeded to autologous or allogeneic
stem cell transplantation (SCT). In nontransplantation
candidates, ATO appeared to yield better results when
combined with either ATRA or chemotherapy for postremission therapy compared with ATO alone.18 SCT
remains the preferred treatment for patients with relapsed
APL who achieve a second remission. In a recent report of
37 patients with relapsed APL who received treatment with
ATO-based salvage regimens, 14 underwent autologous
SCT, whereas 19 continued ATO-based therapy. After a
median follow-up of 32 months, the estimated 5-year
event-free survival (EFS) rate was 83% in patients who
underwent SCT versus 34% in those who did not.20
Limited data exist concerning the role of allogeneic SCT in
this setting.
One important concept in the management of
patients with APL is the difference between molecular
and hematologic relapse. Among patients who received
treatment upfront with ATO-based regimens with or
without SCT, the 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS)
and overall survival (OS) rates were 81% and 100%,
respectively, for the former, and 57% and 72%, respectively, for the latter.21 The most common site of extramedullary APL relapse is the CNS.22 Treatment is
based on the intrathecal administration of methotrexate
and cytarabine with or without steroids or radiation
therapy.23 Because ATO can cross the blood-brain barrier, it may have antileukemic effects in the CNS. In a
European registry study, molecular CR rates were 62%
in patients with molecular relapse, 74% in those with
hematologic relapse, and 100% in those with extramedullary relapse. Complications during induction were
frequent in patients with hematologic relapse but were
absent in those treated for molecular relapse. The 3year rates of OS and cumulative incidence of relapse
were 66% to 68% and 41% to 48%, respectively, in
patients who had a hematologic or molecular relapse
and 90% and 11%, respectively, in patients who had
extramedullary relapse.24

Front-Line Setting
ATO monotherapy

In light of the excellent results attained using ATO to treat
patients with relapsed APL, this agent was tested in the
front-line setting to minimize the toxicity and enhance
the clinical activity of standard induction regimens.
In a study of 197 patients, ATO was administered
for a maximum of 60 days. The study was later amended
to include up to 4 additional courses of ATO. The CR
rate was 86% with a molecular CR rate of 92% in evaluable patients. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate
was 67%, and the 5-year OS rate was 64%.25,26 In a second series (72 patients) using a similar strategy, the CR
and molecular CR rates were 86% and 76%, respectively.27 In an updated analysis of the same study, the
DFS rate was 80% and OS rate 74% at 5 years.28 In both
studies, the early death rate was 14% and was greater in
patients who presented with leukocytosis. An important
finding in these studies was that the patients who received
consolidation therapy had better DFS than those who did
not. Single-agent ATO was also tested in patients aged
60 years who were not candidates for ATRAchemotherapy combinations. Eighty-eight percent of
patients achieved CR, and there were no early deaths. At a
median follow-up of 99 months, the 10-year OS and DFS
rates were 69% and 65%, respectively.29
ATO in combination with ATRA and chemotherapy

An important question is whether the addition of ATO to
the combination of ATRA 1 chemotherapy might offer a
survival advantage over ATRA 1 chemotherapy. Several
studies have addressed this issue.
In a phase 3 intergroup trial, 481 patients with APL
were randomized to receive ATRA 1 daunorubicincytarabine with or without ATO for 2 cycles before consolidation. The 3-year DFS, EFS, and OS rates were 90%
versus 70%, 80% versus 63%, and 86% versus 81%,
respectively.30 In a multicenter North American study
that used a similar strategy, 45 patients received
ATRA 1 daunorubicin followed by consolidation with
cytarabine-daunorubicin for 3 days and ATO for an additional 30 days. Risk-adapted maintenance followed. Four
patients died during induction. After a median follow-up
of 2.7 years, the actuarial 3-year DFS and OS rates were
76% and 88%, respectively.31 In a third study, 271
patients received consolidation therapy with either ATOcontaining or high-dose cytarabine-containing regimens
after induction with ATRA 1 daunorubicin. The estimated 5-year EFS rate was 75% versus 54% in the ATO
arm versus the cytarabine arm, respectively, and the OS

rate was 83% versus 71% (P 5 .002), respectively. The
benefit of ATO was observed in both low-risk and highrisk patients.32 Additional single-arm studies have incorporated ATO into the induction phase of therapy. In general, this strategy seemed feasible, with low early death
rates, CR rates of approximately 95%, and molecular CR
observed in the majority of patients. Both DFS and OS
rates were >90%.33-35
ATO in combination with ATRA without
chemotherapy

Given the significant activity of both ATRA and ATO in
patients with APL, the possibility of combining these
agents for use as induction therapy without cytotoxic
chemotherapy was tested in clinical trials. In a single-arm
study conducted at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, ATO was combined with ATRA for
induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed APL.
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) or idarubicin was used
for cytoreduction in patients with leukocytosis. Postinduction treatment consisted of 4 courses of ATO (daily
for 5 days/week for 4 weeks every other month, for a total
of 80 doses) 1 ATRA (2 weeks on/2 weeks off for 9
months) with or without GO (if patients were positive for
minimal residual disease by polymerase chain reaction after 3 months of CR). The study included 82 patients.
The CR rate was 92%, and 60 patients (73%) achieved a
molecular CR. The early death rate was 9%, and the estimated 3-year OS rate was 85%.36,37
In a small randomized study (61 patients), patients
received single-agent ATO, ATO 1 ATRA, or ATRA
monotherapy for induction therapy.38 The 2 single-agent
arms were closed early because of inferiority, and the
ATO 1 ATRA arm was expanded to include 85 patients.
The authors reported a CR rate of 94% and molecular
CR in all 31 evaluable patients. The early death rate was
6%, and the 5-year RFS and OS rates were 95% and
92%, respectively.39
In another study, 137 patients with newly diagnosed
APL received ATRA 1 ATO for induction, consolidation, and (2-year) maintenance. The CR rate was 93%
with a 7% early death rate. The 5-year OS and RFS rates
were 99% for patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk
disease and 97% and 88%, respectively, for those with
high-risk disease.40 In a similar study, 90 patients with
newly diagnosed APL received ATRA 1 ATO as induction and postremission therapy. The CR rate was 93%.
Postremission therapy with ATRA 1 ATO was associated
with improved RFS at 3 years compared with ATRA 1 chemotherapy in responding patients (93% vs 72%).41
Cancer

April 15, 2016

In a separate long-term study (84 patients; follow-up, 70
months), the estimated 5-year EFS and OS rates were
89% and 92%, respectively, and the ATRA 1 ATO combination appeared to overcome the adverse prognostic significance of elevated white blood cells or FLT3 (fmsrelated tyrosine kinase 3) mutations.39
By comparison, in 4 separate European studies,
patients with APL who received ATRA 1 chemotherapy
without ATO in any phase achieved OS of rates of 82%
to 94%, EFS rates of 76% to not reached, and a cumulative incidence of relapse of 8% to 12%. Patients aged  60
years had an early death rate of 19%, which rose to 48%
in nonstudy-eligible patients who received similar treatment, for a 7-year OS rate of 45%.18
Taken together, the studies described above raise the
question of whether ATRA 1 ATO can provide clinical
benefit equal to that of ATRA 1 chemotherapy, but with
less toxicity. On this basis, Lo-Coco et al conducted a
randomized noninferiority trial of ATRA 1 ATO versus
ATRA 1 idarubicin in patients with newly diagnosed,
nonhigh-risk APL. Almost all patients achieved CR in
both arms. At a median follow-up of 34.4 months, the 2year EFS rate was 97% versus 86% in the former versus
latter group, respectively (P < .001 for noninferiority;
P 5 .02 for superiority of ATRA 1 ATO). Similarly, OS
rates were 99% versus 91%, respectively (P 5 .02). It is
noteworthy that the ATRA 1 ATO combination was
associated with less hematologic toxicity and fewer infections but with greater hepatotoxicity.42 That trial established ATRA 1 ATO as the standard of care for patients
with newly diagnosed, nonhigh-risk APL. A study with
similar design in patients with de novo high-risk APL is
currently underway.
ATO in Other Myeloid Neoplasms

Because of its remarkable activity in APL, ATO has been
tested in other myeloid and nonmyeloid neoplasms with
mixed results. A discussion of the use of ATO in nonmyeloid neoplasms is beyond the scope of this review.
Acute nonpromyelocytic leukemia

ATO was initially tested in elderly patients with acute
nonpromyelocytic leukemia (ANPL), either alone or in
combination with other agents. Overall, the results have
been disappointing. Early small studies had suggested that
ATO alone was essentially ineffective in this setting.
Roboz et al conducted a phase 1/2 study of ATO combined with subcutaneous low-dose cytarabine in a group
of difficult-to-treat elderly patients. The CR rate was
34%, and the rate of death during induction was 8%.43 In
1163

Review Article

a recent phase 1 study, 11 patients with ANPL who had
either relapsed disease or were treatment-na€ıve but unfit
for standard induction received ATO 1 ascorbic acid 5
days per week for 5 weeks. Among 10 evaluable patients,
1 achieved CR, 1 had bone marrow CR, and 4 had < 5%
blasts in bone marrow.44 In another phase 1 study that
included patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
and ANPL, escalating doses of ATO were combined with
ascorbic acid and decitabine. Among 13 patients in that
study, only 1 achieved marrow CR.45
Despite these disappointing results in ANPL, recent
evidence suggests that ATO and ATRA can promote the
degradation of mutated NPM1 (nucleophosmin 1) in
AML cells, resulting in growth arrest and apoptosis,
potentially offering a treatment approach for this subtype
of leukemia.46,47
MDS

In initial studies in patients with MDS, ATO yielded hematologic responses in about 25% of patients, and 33%
to 66% of responders became transfusion-independent.48
In a large phase 2 study (51 evaluable patients), patients
received ATO (0.25 mg/kg daily) 5 days per week for 2
weeks every 28 days. Hematologic improvement rates
were 39% and 9% in lower risk and higher risk patients,
respectively. Transfusion reduction or independence
occurred in 33% of patients. The median response duration was 6.8 months.49 In another phase 2 trial, 115
patients received a loading dose of ATO followed by a
maintenance regimen. In that study, the rate of hematologic improvement was 19%, and the median response
duration was 3.4 months.50
Several studies of ATO-based combinations in
MDS were recently published.51-54 Response rates ranged
from 17% to 30% and lasted up to 26 months, depending
on the patient risk group.
Chronic myeloid leukemia

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines, ATO was
potentially synergistic with imatinib. However, the first 3
patients with CML (in the accelerated phase) who
received treatment with imatinib and ATO obtained
short-lived cytogenetic responses. In 16 patients with
chronic-phase CML and hematologic or cytogenetic progression, imatinib 1 ATO yielded 1 hematologic
response and 2 major cytogenetic responses.48
ORAL ARSENIC FORMULATIONS
Currently, ATO is administered intravenously, thus
necessitating daily clinic visits and administrations during
1164

induction (up to 60 days). This treatment requires hospitalization for at least the first 2 weeks. If a response is
achieved, then a second treatment cycle of 20 to 25 doses
is given 5 days a week for 4 or 5 weeks (consolidation).
Furthermore, vascular access must be maintained through
a central venous catheter, which increases the risk of infections. These limitations may prevent patients from receiving the most active APL therapy, especially when used as
part of a long consolidation regimen. Because of these
inconveniences and the high costs associated with prolonged daily infusions, oral liquid formulations of this
agent were developed.14,15 A synopsis of studies using various oral arsenic preparations for patients with APL is provided in Table 1.
In the first study of oral ATO, 5 of 9 patients who
received treatment obtained CR. No linear correlation
was observed between plasma and/or cellular ATO levels
and response.14 In a subsequent study, 12 patients with
relapsed APL received oral ATO at a dose of 10 mg daily
until CR, followed by idarubicin consolidation. All
patients achieved CR after a median of 37 days. At a median follow-up of 14 months, 7 patients maintained CR.
Four of the 5 patients who relapsed were successfully salvaged with ATRA-oral ATO. It is noteworthy that the
PML/RARa transcript became negative in 11 patients. Reversible adverse events in that study were elevation of liver
enzyme levels, skin rash, and headaches. No electrocardiographic abnormalities were reported.55 In fact, the QTCprolonging effects of oral ATO tended to be less compared with the effects from the intravenous formulation.
Similar observations of efficacy and adverse effects were
noted in an Australian experience.57
An oral solution of ATO was also tested as maintenance therapy for patients with APL who had achieved
CR after induction and consolidation with daunorubicincytarabine and ATRA. Seventy-six patients received oral
ATO for 2 weeks every 2 months for a total of 2 years.
Once again, no significant electrocardiogram abnormalities were recorded. The 3-year DFS, EFS, and OS rates
were 88%, 84%, and 91%, respectively.56 Oral ATO has
anecdotally been used in patients with end-stage renal disease who were receiving peritoneal dialysis60 or hemodialysis61 or in those who underwent liver transplantation.62
The second arsenic-containing compound, As4S4,
was tested in a pilot study of 129 patients with APL,
including 103 who were in first CR. Most patients with
newly diagnosed or relapsed disease attained hematologic,
cytogenetic, and molecular CRs. Among patients who
were in CR, 35 of 44 evaluable patients achieved molecular CR. The 3-year DFS rate in patients with relapsed

disease was 76.6%, and the 6-year DFS rate in those in
first CR was 87.4%.15
More recently, a randomized noninferiority trial was
conducted to compare an As4S4-containing formulation
(Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula [RIF]) (60 mg/kg) with
intravenous ATO (0.16 mg/kg) in patients with previously untreated APL (n 5 242). Both formulations were
combined with standard-dose ATRA for induction and
maintenance. Consolidation consisted of 3 courses of conventional chemotherapy. Patients in both groups achieved
similar CR rates (P 5 .62). After a median follow-up of
39 months, the 2-year DFS rate was 98.1% versus 95.5%
in the RIF group versus the ATO group. The difference in
DFS was 2.6% (95% confidence interval, 23% to 8%),
which met the primary endpoint of <10% noninferiority
margin. OS was similar between the 2 groups (P 5 0.18),
and the toxicity profiles were also similar.58
On the basis of this study, the same group conducted
another pilot study of RIF 1 ATRA without chemotherapy in 20 patients with nonhigh-risk APL. Postremission
therapy consisted of the same 2 agents given for up to 7
months. All 20 patients achieved CR in about 30 days and
molecular CR (the primary endpoint) at 6 months. Differentiation syndrome occurred in 2 patients, and leukocytosis in occurred in 7. It is noteworthy that 10 patients
completed induction entirely without hospitalization. All
patients received postremission treatment at home and
reported a nearly normal quality of life.59 A multicenter,
randomized trial comparing ATRA combined with either
RIF or intravenous ATO without conventional chemotherapy is underway in China. The issue of outpatient
therapy for newly diagnosed APL, as it pertains to hemorrhagic complications (particularly in high-risk patients),
remains controversial.63
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
ATO is an ancient drug that has recently been rediscovered as an important antileukemia agent, and it has been
used successfully in the treatment of patients with newly
diagnosed and relapsed APL, both as a single agent and in
combination with other agents. The combination of
ATO 1 ATRA is at least as effective as, and is less toxic
than, combined ATRA 1 chemotherapy. This is now an
established standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed, low-risk and intermediate-risk APL. The optimal
use of ATO in the consolidation and maintenance setting
remains to be established. The results indicate that an oral
liquid preparation of ATO had activity equal to, and possibly a more favorable toxicity profile than, the intravenous formulation and improved the patients’ quality of
1166

life. Other derivatives of arsenic also may be active in this
setting. An entirely oral, chemotherapy-free regimen
might now become a reality for patients with newly diagnosed, low-risk and intermediate-risk APL. In selected
patients, treatment could be administered entirely in the
outpatient setting. The results of ongoing trials seeking to
replicate this success in patients with high-risk APL are
awaited.
