ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer remains extremely difficult to treat, with the average
lifespan following diagnosis being only 3-6 months, resulting in a death to incidence
ratio of 0.94. A major reason for this high mortality rate is resistance to the main
chemotherapeutic agent used to treat this disease, gemcitabine. Alterations in
nucleoside and gemcitabine metabolism, specifically over-expression of ribonucleotide
reductase, have been implicated as a major mechanism of resistance to this drug.
Here, we show that inhibition of sphingosine kinase-2 by the specific inhibitor
ABC294640 is synergistically cytotoxic with gemcitabine toward three human
pancreatic cancer cell lines. Treatment with ABC294640 results in decreased
expression of both RRM2 and MYC in all three cell lines. Additionally, expression of
c-Myc protein and phosphorylation of Rb at S780 both decrease in a dose-dependent
manner in response to ABC294640, while acetylation of H3-K9 and p21 levels increase.
Pretreatment with the protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor okadaic acid or the ceramide
synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 fails to prevent the effects of ABC294640 on Rb
phosphorylation. These data indicate a role for sphingosine kinase-2 in E2F and c-Myc
mediated transcription through alteration of histone acetylation and p21 expression.
These effects of ABC294640 suggest that it may be an effective agent for pancreatic
cancer, particularly in combination with gemcitabine.

gemcitabine metabolism (reviewed by Bergman et al.
[3]), most notably through overexpression of the catalytic
subunit (RRM2) of ribonucleotide reductase.
Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) catalyzes the reduction
of ribonucleotides yielding deoxyribonucleotides, and is the
rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis. Its enzymatic activity
is controlled mainly through transcriptional regulation [4].
A gemcitabine resistant cell line generated by incremental
increases in exposure to gemcitabine was found to have a 9and 2-fold increase in RRM2 mRNA and protein expression,
respectively [5]. Additionally, expression levels of RRM2
in tumors were shown to be predictive of treatment
responsiveness to gemcitabine [6]. The inhibition of RRM2
by RNAi technology [7] or exposure to flavopiridol [8], an
upstream inhibitor of RRM2 transcription, has been shown
to restore sensitivity to gemcitabine.

INTRODUCTION
For the last ten years the incidence rate of
pancreatic cancer has been rising in the US while the
five year survival rate remains near 6% [1]. The two
main reasons for this alarming statistic are the lack of
early warning signs of the disease which leads to a delay
in diagnosis, often after the cancer has already grown
beyond the borders of the pancreas, and resistance to
the mainline chemotherapeutic drug, gemcitabine, a difluorinated nucleoside analog of deoxycytidine. After
intracellular phosphorylation, gemcitabine induces cell
death predominantly by incorporating into the DNA,
leading to strand termination and subsequent apoptosis
[2]. Chemoresistance to gemcitabine, whether inherent
or acquired, occurs most often through modification of

Another key protein that regulates pancreatic
cancer cell sensitivity to gemcitabine is c-Myc, a central
transcription factor with a plethora of target genes that
play roles in proliferation, mitochondrial biogenesis,
and glucose metabolism. The MYC proto-oncogene is
overexpressed in many types of cancer [9], including
pancreatic cancer [10] where it has been shown to decrease
sensitivity to gemcitabine [11, 12].
Sphingolipids are important signaling lipids
involved in several key cellular processes. The de novo
synthesis of sphingolipids begins with the palmitoylation
of serine yielding 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, which is
reduced to dihydrosphingosine (dhSph), which is acylated
to produce dihydroceramide (dhCer). dhCer is converted
to ceramide (Cer) by dihydroceramide desaturase, which
can then be further metabolized to additional types of
sphingolipids. Of most importance to this research,
however, is the ceramidase-mediated cleavage of ceramide
to yield sphingosine. Sphingosine can be phosphorylated
by one of two sphingosine kinases (SphK1 and SphK2)
to form sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) which is degraded
by S1P-lyase. Ceramide, sphingosine and S1P regulate
reciprocal signaling events such that excess sphingosine
and/or ceramide induce apoptosis in tumor cells, while
S1P is pro-proliferation (reviewed by Hannun et al. [13]).
Sphingolipids have previously been shown to
affect upstream modulators of both RRM2 and c-Myc
transcription. Both MYC [14, 15] and RRM2 [16, 17]
have E2F binding sites in their promoters subjecting
them to partial control by the retinoblastoma family of
proteins. Specifically, hypophosphorylated Rb binds
E2Fs preventing the transcription of its target genes [18].
Two classes of proteins determine the phosphorylation
status of Rb. Cyclin dependent kinases are responsible
for phosphorylation[19] while protein phosphatases
dephosphorylate Rb [20]. The addition of exogenous
sphingosine induces the dephosphorylation of Rb,
and addition of the ceramidase inhibitor fumonisin B1
potentiates this response [21]. Addition of C2-ceramide
also leads to the dephosphorylation of Rb as a result of an
increase in p21 expression and a corresponding decrease
in the expression of MYC[15]. Therefore, modulation
of sphingolipid signaling may provide a novel means of
sensitizing pancreatic tumor cells to gemcitabine.
We have previously shown that the sphingosine
kinase 2 selective inhibitor ABC294640 has broad antitumor activity [22, 23], that its effects mimic SphK2
ablation, and that loss of SphK2 impacts tumor growth
more profoundly than loss of SphK1 [24]. Additionally,
ABC294640 has been shown to decrease intracellular
c-Myc levels in a variety of cancer cell types [25, 26].
Here, we show ABC294640 increases gemcitabine
sensitivity in three human pancreatic cancer cell lines
(BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2, and Panc-1), and that this is
associated with increased acetylation of lysine 9 on histone
3 and increases in p21. This reduces the phosphorylation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of Rb, leading to the sequestration of E2F1 and thereby
decreasing the expression of both MYC and RRM2.
These data provide mechanistic rationale for combination
of ABC294640 with gemcitabine as a new therapeutic
approach to pancreatic cancer.

RESULTS
ABC294640 enhances the cytotoxicity of
gemcitabine toward pancreatic cancer cells
We have previously described the anticancer effects
of multiple SphK inhibitors [27], and ABC294640, an
SphK2 selective inhibitor, was found to have broad
anti-cancer activity [22]. Its combination with the
established anticancer drug sorafenib results in synergistic
cytotoxicity toward A498 cells, as well as the pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cell line, BxPC-3 [28]. We have now
combined ABC294640 with the nucleoside analog
gemcitabine to evaluate their usefulness together as a
potential therapy for pancreatic cancer. We first established
the 96-hour IC50 concentrations for gemcitabine and
ABC294640 (single-agent) in BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2 and
Panc-1 cells as 7.4, 404 and 111 nM for gemcitabine, and
28.5, 35.2 and 23.2 μM for ABC294640, respectively
(Figure 1a). Thus, the pancreatic cancer cell lines have
a much greater range of sensitivity to gemcitabine than
they do to ABC294640. Additionally, each cell line was
treated with multiple concentrations of ABC294640 and
gemcitabine and cell survival was quantified after 96
hours. Combination of ABC294640 with gemcitabine
resulted in synergistic cell killing (Combination Index
<1.0) in all three cell lines at and above the IC50 for each
individual drug (Figure 1b). Interestingly, combining
ABC294640 and gemcitabine in MiaPaCa-2 cells, the cell
line with the highest intrinsic resistance to gemcitabine,
resulted in the lowest CI values, which are indicative of
strong synergism.

ABC294640 suppresses the expression of c-Myc
and RRM2 in pancreatic cancer cells
Recently, it was shown that inhibition of SphK2
by ABC294640 results in decreased c-Myc expression
in acute lymphoblastic leukemia [25], multiple myeloma
[26] and prostate cancer [29, 30] cells. Here, we show that
ABC294640 causes a concentration-dependent decrease
in MYC mRNA, as well as c-Myc protein, in three
pancreatic cell lines. BxPC-3 cells were most responsive,
experiencing a near 50% reduction in mRNA and protein
expression when treated with 30 μM ABC294640
(Figure 2a & 2b). MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells had more
moderate decreases in mRNA levels, but demonstrated
similar decreases in protein expression when treated with
30 μM ABC294640. When comparing the native protein
expression levels of c-Myc among the three cell lines,

RMM2, that drive pancreatic cancer growth and resistance
to chemotherapy.
Because the role of proteasomal degradation in the
suppression of c-Myc expression appears to vary among
cell types [25, 26, 29], proteasomal degradation was
addressed as a potential mechanism for c-Myc suppression
in the panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines. Cells were
treated with the respective IC50 dose of ABC294640
with and without the proteasome inhibitor MG-132.
As indicated in Figure 3, MG-132 did not abrogate
the effect of ABC294640 in BxPC-3 cells, indicting a
proteasome-independent pathway for c-Myc reduction
in these cells. However, MG-132 substantially increased

untreated BxPC-3 cells were found to express substantially
less c-Myc than the other two cell lines (Figure 2e).
Overexpression of the catalytic subunit of
ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2) has often been cited as
one of the major mechanisms for gemcitabine resistance
[5–7]. Therefore, we examined the effect of ABC294640
on RRM2 transcription and translation in the pancreatic
cell line panel. Treatment of the BxPc-3, MiaPaCa-2 or
Panc-1 cells with ABC294640 resulted in a near 50%
reduction in RRM2 mRNA in all three cell lines, which
was matched by decreases in RRM2 protein expression
(Figure 2c & 2d). Therefore, ABC294640 causes dosedependent suppression of two key genes, MYC and

the accumulation of c-Myc in both MiaPaCa-2 and Panc1 cells following ABC294640 treatment (Figure 3),
suggesting that ABC294640-mediated reduction of c-Myc
in these cells is at least partially by enhanced proteolysis.

(which are the most resistant to gemcitabine (Figure
1a)) demonstrated the most extensive suppression of Rb
phosphorylation by ABC294640 among the pancreatic
cancer cell lines. Therefore, lack of sensitivity to
gemcitabine does not prevent the signaling effects from
inhibition of SphK2.
It has previously been shown that exogenous
short-chain ceramides cause accumulation of longchain ceramides via the salvage pathway, leading to
inhibition of c-Myc in A549 cells [32]. Ceramides have
been shown to directly activate protein phosphatase 1
(PP-1) which dephosphorylates Rb both in vitro [33]
and in vivo [34]. Similarly, previous studies showed
that exposing cells to sphingosine caused a reduction
in Rb phosphorylation [21]. Combining these findings
suggests that elevation of ceramide and/or sphingosine
levels may activate PP-1, causing dephosphorylation of
Rb, leading to the sequestration of E2F and decreased
transcription of c-Myc. Because ABC294640 inhibits
conversion of sphingosine to S1P, we sought to determine
whether elevated sphingosine is responsible for the
observed decrease in pRb (S780) in ABC294640-treated
cells, or whether the increased sphingosine is salvaged
back to ceramide (by ceramide synthases) which may
activate protein phosphatases. Therefore, BxPC-3 cells

ABC294640-regulation of c-Myc is mediated by
suppression of Rb phosphorylation
The Retinoblastoma protein, Rb, is a tumor
suppressor controlling the cell cycle by sequestering
several E2F family transcription factors (E2F1-5, hereafter
termed E2F). Previous studies have shown that E2F can
control the transcription of c-Myc [15, 31] and RRM2 [14,
16]. Phosphorylation of multiple serine residues of Rb
causes release of E2F, and is correlated with the activation
state of E2F [18]. Importantly, sphingosine, but not S1P
has also been shown to activate Rb [21]. Because of this
linkage with sphingolipid metabolism, we examined the
effects of ABC294640 on the phosphorylation state of Rb
as an indicator of E2F activity. As indicated in Figure 4a
and 4b, treatment of BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2 or Panc-1 cells
with increasing concentrations of ABC294640 resulted in
dose-dependent decreases in the phosphorylation of Rb
at S780, which would result in increased sequestration
and inhibition of E2F. Interestingly, MiaPaCa-2 cells

were treated with ABC294640 and fumonisin B1 (FB1),
an inhibitor of ceramide synthases, and examined for
changes in the phosphorylation status of Rb as well as
changes in c-Myc. As indicated in Figure 4c, FB1 did not
prevent the dephosphorylation of Rb or the downstream
suppression of c-Myc by ABC294640. Based on these data
and those of Pushkareva et al regarding the relationship
between sphingosine, ceramide, ceramidase and Rb
phosphorylation [21], it is reasonable to conclude that
ABC294640 reduction of Rb phosphorylation is mediated
by sphingosine rather than a ceramide-dependent
mechanism.
To further investigate the mechanism for the
decrease in Rb phosphorylation, we inhibited PP-1 in
BxPC-3 cells using the established phosphatase inhibitor
okadaic acid (OA) [34–36]. As indicated in Figure 4d,
OA alone caused a slight increase in Rb phosphorylation
at S780, but did not substantially attenuate the
dephosphorylation of Rb caused by ABC294640.
Furthermore, OA did not prevent the reduction of c-Myc
expression in cells also treated with ABC294640. These
data indicate that the decrease in Rb phosphorylation and
c-Myc expression by ABC294640 is not due to increased
protein phosphatase activity.

phosphatases 1 and 2. Because OA failed to prevent the
hypophosphorylation of Rb in response to ABC294640,
this response may be mediated by inhibition of cdks.
Therefore, the effects of ABC294640 on the cdk inhibitor
p21, which binds to the cyclinD/cdk4/6 complex
inhibiting the kinase activity, were assessed. Treatment
of BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2 or Panc-1 cells with increasing
concentrations of ABC294640 resulted in concentrationdependent increases in p21 expression as determined by
immunoblotting (Figure 5a). Because elevation of p21
is associated with G1 arrest, we examined the effect of
ABC294640 on the cell cycle distributions of the three
pancreatic cancer cell lines. As indicated in Figure 5b,
increasing concentrations of ABC294640 resulted in
increasing numbers of cells in the G1 phase for all three
cell lines. Elevation of p21 is often the result of increased
p53 activity, and all three of the pancreatic cancer cell
lines under study have inactivating mutations in p53.
Nonetheless, we examined the impact of ABC294640 on
total p53 and phospho-p53 (S15) levels, and found no
observable changes in either after ABC294640 treatment
(data not shown).
Increasing lysine acetylation by inhibition of
histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been shown to
increase the expression of p21 [37] and to decrease
the expression of c-Myc [38–42]. Because both of
these changes occur in cells treated with ABC294640,
we assessed the effects of the drug on levels of
lysine-9 acetylation of histone H3 (H3-K9ac) in each
of the pancreatic cancer cell lines. Treatment with
ABC294640 caused dose-dependent elevations of

H3-K9ac, particularly in MiaPaCa-2and Panc-1 cells
(Figure 5a). These data are consistent with the model
in which ABC294640 depletes the nuclear pool of S1P,
thereby suppressing HDAC activity and altering protein
expression.

to ablating the tumorigenic effects of c-Myc. Consistent
with recent publications in other cell types [25, 26, 29,
30], we demonstrate herein that ABC294640 downregulates the expression of c-Myc in pancreatic cancer
cells. Overexpression of c-Myc in the pancreas was
shown to produce ductal adenocarcinoma in transgenic
mice [48], and cells over-expressing c-Myc have been
reported to be resistant to gemcitabine [12]. ABC294640mediated reduction of c-Myc by enhanced proteasomal
degradation has been observed in some cell lines [26].
Our data show that reduction of c-Myc by ABC294640
in BxPC-3 cells is not affected by proteasome inhibition;
whereas in MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells, addition of
ABC294640 following pretreatment with MG-132
increased levels of c-Myc. This paradoxical increase in
c-Myc expression does not overcome the suppression of
proliferation by ABC294640, and may reflect the cells’
attempt to compensate for the antiproliferative effects
of the drug. In addition to effects on proliferation,
suppression of c-Myc may directly reduce RMM2
expression since the RMM2 promoter contains a
stimulatory c-Myc binding motif [49].
Herein, we show that inhibition of SphK2 by
ABC294640 results in an increase in p21 expression that
correlates with G1 arrest in three human pancreatic cancer
cell lines. This agrees with our earlier findings which
showed that SphK2 inhibition via siRNA increases in the
percentage of A498 cells in the G1 phase [24]. This is also
consistent with studies with Hs 27 human fibroblasts that
demonstrated that addition of exogenous C2-ceramide
results in increases in p21 and growth arrest [15].
However, the fate of p21 expression as a result of SphK2
inhibition may be cell type specific since it is reported that
SphK2 siRNA decreases p21 expression in MCF7 breast
cancer cells [50]. c-Myc also acts as a transcriptional
suppressor of p21 [51], and so downregulation of c-Myc
by ABC294640 leads to a release of p21 suppression.
Suppression of p21 expression by ABC294640 is
predictably linked to reduction in the phosphorylation
status of Rb, and a consequent suppression of E2F
transcriptional activity. Additionally, the E2F transcription
factors are transcriptional targets of c-Myc [52]; and
therefore, Myc suppression can also indirectly decrease
the transcription of E2F target genes. Given the roles of
genes regulated by E2F, attenuation of its activities is
an attractive approach for chemotherapy. Most directly
relevant to the present study is the observation that
transcription of RRM2 is partially dependent on E2F
transcription factor activity [14, 16], mediated by two E2F
binding sites in the RRM2 promoter [49].
Data presented herein indicate a key role for
suppression of HDAC activity by ABC294640, and
this is consistent with previous studies indicating
that HDAC inhibitors increase the efficacy of
gemcitabine [53]. Additionally, the observed effects
of ABC294640 on increasing p21 [37] and diminished

DISCUSSION
Acquired resistance to gemcitabine is a major
factor in the poor response of pancreatic tumors to current
chemotherapy protocols. Here, we show that the inhibition
of SphK2 by ABC294640 synergizes with gemcitabine
to increase pancreatic cancer cell killing. Interestingly,
this synergy was most pronounced in the most resistant
cell line, MiaPaCa-2, where synergy was observed
well below the IC50 concentration for gemcitabine. The
present studies provide the first evidence that inhibition
of SphK2 by ABC294640 directly affects the metabolism
of gemcitabine through the down-regulation of RMM2
expression. Ribonucleotide reductase overexpression
results in an increased pool of dNTPs that outcompete
gemcitabine for incorporation into elongating DNA
during replication. Therefore, overexpression of RRM2 is
a major mechanism for gemcitabine resistance [5–7]. The
synergistic killing of pancreatic tumor cells by combined
treatment with ABC294640 plus gemcitabine is likely
mediated by suppression of RRM2-mediated resistance in
parallel with suppression of proliferation by the SphK2
inhibitor.
Improved cell killing by combining ABC294640
with gemcitabine is consistent with our previous
findings and those of others that demonstrate that
ABC294640 can be effectively combined with other
cancer drugs. For example, Antoon et al. demonstrated
the ability of ABC294640 to overcome NF-κBmediated chemoresistance in breast cancer [43]. This is
highly relevant to pancreatic cancer because NF-κB is
overexpressed in 70% of patients [44] and is thought to
be an additonal mechanism for gemcitabine resistance
[45]. Additionally, treatment of ovarian cancer cells with
ABC294640 caused increased expression of BAX [46],
thereby tilting the balance of the bcl-2 family of proteins,
which are known to contribute to gemcitabine resistance
[47], in the pro-apoptotic direction. The accumulated
data provide a compelling argument for combination
of ABC294640 and gemcitabine for the treatment of
pancreatic cancer.
c-Myc is a transcription factor downstream of
p38 kinase with well-documented oncogenic activity
(reviewed by Miller et al[9]). Overexpression of
c-Myc induces the transcription of genes that promote
proliferation, stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, and
regulate glucose metabolism. Because direct targeting
of c-Myc with new drugs has not yet been successful,
reducing its expression and activity by targeting upstream
regulators may be the most practical current approach

c-Myc are indicative of HDAC inhibition [38-42, 54].
Although SphK2 and SphK2-derived S1P have been
previously suggested to inhibit HDAC activity [50], as
demonstrated in Figure 5, ABC294640 increases H3K9ac which indicates inhibition of HDAC activity.
We postulate that inhibition of SphK2 by ABC294640
reduces the association of nuclear S1P with HDAC2
leading to a decrease in the binding of H3-K9ac to the
MYC promoter and decreased c-Myc expression [25].
Therefore, ABC294640 inhibits MYC transcription on
two fronts, ie HDAC inhibition directly decreases MYC
transcription and E2F-regulated transcription is also
suppressed.
In total, data presented herein further underscore
the importance of sphingolipid metabolism in regulating
both cell proliferation and pancreatic tumor cell
sensitivity to gemcitabine. Specifically, these studies
provide a new model in which nuclear S1P derived
from SphK2 promotes the expression of the key proproliferative and metabolism genes MYC and RRM2
(Figure 6). A central role for inhibition of HDAC
activity by ABC294640 resulting in multifaceted, but
complimentary, downstream modulation of c-Myc,

p21, phospho-Rb and RRM2 expression all combine
to attenuate tumor cell proliferation and increase
sensitivity to gemcitabine. Specifically, the mechanism
by which ABC294640 suppresses c-Myc and RRM2
expression appears to be at least partially mediated
by inhibition of HDAC activity, which leads to an
increase in p21 transcription and decrease in MYC
transcription. The increase in p21 results in a decrease
in Rb phosphorylation due to the inhibition of cyclin/
CDK complexes. Hypophosphorylated Rb sequesters
E2F preventing its transcriptional activity, resulting in a
decrease in c-Myc and RRM2. c-Myc has transcriptional
impact on multiple members of this signaling pathway,
creating an amplification process and thereby ensuring
cancer cell death.
As a whole, these data contribute to our
understanding of the roles of SphK2 in tumor biology,
further supporting critical roles for sphingolipids as
regulators of gene expression. We have also elucidated a
mechanism through which synergy between ABC294640
and gemcitabine may occur. Because, few drugs
counteract multiple modes of drug resistance, we believe
the accumulated information supports the future combined

Figure 6: Postulated mechanism of action of ABC294640. ABC294640 acts by inhibiting SphK2 in the nucleus leading to HDAC
inhibition because of loss of nuclear S1P and/or elevation of nuclear sphingosine levels. This results in an increase in p21 which binds CDK/
Cyclin-D1 complexes preventing the phosphorylation of Rb. The resulting hypophosphorylated Rb binds E2F preventing its transcriptional
activity. It should also be noted that c-Myc inhibits the transcription of p21 and enhances the transcription of CDKs, Cyclin-D1, and E2F1,
2 and 3. The overall result is a decrease in proliferative signaling thereby resulting in inhibition of cancer growth.

use of gemcitabine and ABC294640 for pancreatic cancer
chemotherapy.

(Pierce) was used to determine protein concentration,
and samples were then equalized using lysis buffer.
For SDS-PAGE, samples containing 30 μg of protein
were separated on 10-well 10% Mini-PROTEAN®
TGX™ pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad) and then transferred
to polyvinyl difluoride membranes using the TransBlot® SD Semi-Dry Electrophoretic Transfer Cell
(Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked for 1 hour in
5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then incubated
with primary antibody for 1-2 hours according to
the manufacturer’s recommended dilution (typically
1:1000). After washing, the membrane was incubated
with a horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 hour (1:30,000). After washing, 1 mL
of an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo
Scientific) was applied to the membrane and imaging
was carried out in a dark room with HyBlot® CL
autoradiography film (Denville Scientific).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection,
and were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. BxPC-3 cells were grown in RPMI
1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 25 μg/mL gentamicin. MiaPaCa-2 cells were grown
in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 5% horse serum and 25
μg/mL gentamicin. Panc-1 cells were grown in DMEM
containing 10% FBS and 25 μg/mL gentamicin.

Reagents
ABC294640 (cGMP grade) was provided by
Apogee Biotechnology Corporation. Gemcitabine HCl
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The following
antibodies were purchased from: Cell Signaling - c-Myc
(9402s), p21 (2947P), pRb (S780) (9307P), Rb (9309P),
GAPDH (2118s), Santa Cruz - Ubiquitin (sc-8017) and
Abcam - RRM2 (ab57653). The following primers were
purchased from Qiagen: MYC (PPH00100B), RRM2
(PPH14649A), SPHK1 (PPH02491A), and SPHK2
(PPH21192A) GAPDH(PPH00150F).

Quantitative PCR
Following treatment, cells were harvested and total
RNA was collected using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and
quantified using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific). RNA (1 μg) was used to synthesize
cDNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis
System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The cDNA samples
were aliquoted and combined with primers, nuclease-free
water and SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix, and qRT-PCR
was carried out on a MyiQ Real-Time PCR system (BioRad). The cycling parameters consisted of 1 enzyme
activating cycle of 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 45
cycles of denaturation (95°C for 45 sec) and annealing/
extension (60°C for 1 min). The cycle threshold was
determined for each sample and the values were
normalized to GAPDH.

Cytotoxicity assays
96-well plates were seeded with 3,000 cells/
well and incubated overnight. Cells were then treated
with varying concentrations of gemcitabine and/or
ABC294640 and after 96 hours of treatment, the medium
was removed and the cells were washed with PhosphateBuffered Saline (PBS) and fixed in 10% trichloroacetic
acid (TCA) overnight at 4°C. The TCA was then removed
and the cells were washed with water three times before
adding sulpharhodamine B (4 g/L in 1% acetic acid)
for 30 minutes. The cells were then de-stained with
1% acetic acid and left to dry. 100 μL of 10 mM TRIS
was then added to each well and the absorbance at 560
nm was measured using a SpectraMax M5 platereader
(Molecular Devices).

Statistics and graphing
All graphs, as well as IC50 calculations and treatment
comparison statistics, were made using GraphPad Prism
(version 5). Combination Index (CI) calculations were
made using Calcusyn (Biosoft) following the software’s
designed protocol for synergy calculations.
