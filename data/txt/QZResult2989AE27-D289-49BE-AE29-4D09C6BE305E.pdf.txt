BACKGROUND: The type 3 Dearing reovirus (Reolysin) is a naturally occurring virus that preferentially infects and causes oncolysis in
tumor cells with a Ras-activated pathway. It induces host immunity and cell cycle arrest and acts synergistically with cytotoxic
agents. METHODS: This study evaluated Reolysin combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with metastatic/recurrent
KRAS-mutated or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–mutated/amplified non–small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Thirty-seven
patients were treated. Molecular alterations included 20 KRAS mutations, 10 EGFR amplifications, 3 EGFR mutations, and 4 BRAFV600E mutations. In total, 242 cycles (median, 4; range, 1-47) were completed. The initial doses were area under the curve (AUC)
6 mg/mL/min for carboplatin, 200 mg/m2 for paclitaxel on day 1, and 3 3 1010 50% tissue culture infective dose for Reolysin on days 1
to 5 of each 21-day cycle. Because of diarrhea and febrile neutropenia (in the first 2 patients), subsequent doses were reduced to
175 mg/m2 for paclitaxel and AUC 5 mg/mL/min for carboplatin. Toxicities included fatigue, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, neutropenia,
arthralgia/myalgia, anorexia, and electrolyte abnormalities. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0 responses included the
following: partial response for 11 patients, stable disease (SD) for 20 patients, progressive disease for 4 patients, and not evaluable
for 2 patients (objective response rate, 31%; 90% 1-sided lower confidence interval, 21%). Four SD patients had >40% positron emission tomography standardized uptake value reductions. The median progression-free survival, median overall survival, and 12-month
overall survival rate were 4 months, 13.1 months, and 57%, respectively. Seven patients were alive after a median follow-up of 34.2
months; they included 2 patients without disease progression at 37 and 50 months. CONCLUSIONS: Reolysin in combination with
paclitaxel and carboplatin was well tolerated. The observed response rate suggests a benefit of the reovirus for chemotherapy. A
follow-up randomized study is recommended. The proportion of patients surviving longer than 2 years (30%) suggests a second/
third-line treatment effect or possibly the triggering of an immune response after tumor reovirus infiltration. Cancer 2016;122:875-83.

INTRODUCTION
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dysregulation and KRAS mutations occur commonly in non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), and both lead to downstream activation of Ras-dependent pathways. Patients with non–EGFRmutated/EGFR-amplified tumors derive little benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), whereas no effective
KRAS-targeted therapy is currently available. Targeting Ras-dependent pathways is, therefore, a major area of unmet therapeutic need in NSCLC.
The type 3 Dearing strain reovirus (Reolysin) is a naturally occurring, ubiquitous, nonenveloped human reovirus
with a genome that consists of 10 segments of double-stranded RNA. In preclinical studies, it has been shown to induce
host immunity and cell cycle arrest and to act synergistically with chemotherapy.1 A reovirus infection begins with the
internalization of the virus via the attachment of the reovirus sigma 1 protein to the cell surface sialic acid residues.2
Enhanced infection efficiency has been observed with either functional EGFR or the v-erb B oncogene.3,4 In unsusceptible
cells, a reovirus infection results in the autophosphorylation of double-stranded RNA–activated protein kinase R (PKR).

Figure 1. Stepwise and schematic representation of the reovirus type 3 Dearing mechanism of action in the cytoplasm of cancer
cells with an activated ras signaling pathway. The phosphorylated proteins (EGFR, and PKR) are tagged with P. EGFR indicates
epidermal growth factor receptor; mRNA, messenger RNA; PKR, protein kinase R.

The phosphorylation event activates PKR, which in turn
phosphorylates the a subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 and subsequently inhibits viral protein synthesis.5,6
In reovirus-susceptible cells, the active Ras-signaling pathway inhibits the autophosphorylation of PKR and thereby
permits the synthesis of viral proteins and results in the
lysis of the host cell (Fig. 1). In EGFR-, Sos-, or rastransformed cells, PKR is held in a nonphosphorylated
state, and the replication of the reovirus proceeds uninhibited.6 The dependence of reovirus activity on activation
or mutation of the Ras pathway may be indicationspecific.7,8
A reovirus administered with paclitaxel was synergistic in all NSCLC cell lines examined, including those with
high-level resistance to paclitaxel or the reovirus.9 Phase
1 clinical trials involving Reolysin dispensed as a
monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, or paclitaxel and carboplatin
demonstrated its good tolerability as monotherapy (mild
to moderate flulike symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were the major side effects) and a lack of exacerbation of the toxicities of the chemotherapeutic agents when
it was given in combination.10-13
876

Because of the preferential activity for Reolysin
observed in Ras-activated cells, we set out to screen
NSCLC patients to select those with a KRAS-activated
pathway through KRAS mutations or EGFR mutations
or amplification and to establish the safety and efficacy of
Reolysin in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin
in those patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The institutional review boards of Ohio State University
and Georgetown University approved this study (NCT
00861627 at ClinicalTrials.gov). Patients who were 18
years old or older and had recurrent or metastatic NSCLC
with EGFR activation (EGFR-activating mutations in
exons 18-21 or EGFR fluorescence in situ hybridization
[FISH] amplification) or KRAS mutations (exon 2, codons 12, 13, and 61) and no previous cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease (except previous therapy for
localized disease or TKIs for EGFR-mutant patients) were
eligible. Other eligibility requirements included the following: the signing of written informed consent, a lapse of

at least 6 months from prior adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status  2, and normal organ and marrow function (absolute neutrophil count  1.5 3 109,
platelets  100 3 109, hemoglobin  9 g/dL, serum creatinine and bilirubin  1.5 times the upper limit of normal, and
aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase  2.5
times the upper limit of normal). TKI treatment and palliative
radiation must have been discontinued for at least 4 weeks,
and the toxicities must have been reduced to grade 1 or lower.
Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, brain metastases
(resected oligometastases were allowed), grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy, uncontrolled concurrent illness (including a known cardiac ejection fraction < 40%), known human
immunodeficiency virus infection, and active hepatitis B or C.
Molecular Characterization

All molecular studies were performed centrally at the Molecular Pathology Core Facility at Ohio State University
(OSU-PCF). FISH for EGFR amplification was performed with a commercially available Vysis dual-color,
dual-probe kit to determine the ratio of the EGFR gene
(orange) to CEP7 (green) in the tumor cells under a fluorescence microscope, and it was interpreted by a boardcertified pathologist. Positive amplification was scored if
any of the following were observed: 1) EGFR/CEP7
ratio  2, 2)  15 copies of EGFR per cell in 10% or
more of analyzed cells, and 3) EGFR copy numbers per
nucleus  4 in 20% or more of analyzed cells.
For the identification of EGFR and KRAS mutations, genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue with the Qiagen DNA preparation kit, and the target sequences containing the targeted
mutations were amplified by polymerase chain reaction
with specific primers for the genes of interest. After purification, the polymerase chain reaction products were
sequenced with an ABI 3130xl DNA analyzer and were
interpreted by a pathologist at OSU-PCF.
Study Design and Treatment Plan

The study was a single-arm, Fleming-A’Hern, singlestage, open-label, phase 2 study14,15 with a 6-patient run
in a mini–phase 1 portion to ensure the appropriateness
of chemotherapy doses for combination with Reolysin.
Paclitaxel was administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion, and carboplatin was administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. The chemotherapy was followed by
Reolysin, which was administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion at a dose of 3 3 1010 50% tissue culture
infective dose (TCID50) on day 1. On days 2 through 5,
Cancer

Reolysin alone was administered at the same dose and
with the same method used on day 1.
The study was designed to reject the combination
therapy with a 90% chance (10% 1-sided type I error) if
the objective response rate (ORR) was 20% and to consider the combination worthy of further study with a high
chance (90%; 10% type II error) if the true ORR was
40% or more. Thirty-six response-evaluable patients were
planned for recruitment, and an improvement was determined if more than 10 of the 36 patients were observed to
have objective response. A partial response (PR) required
a Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) 1.0 computed tomography (CT) response or
at least a 40% uptake reduction in positron emission
tomography (PET)–avid lesions.
For the phase 1 portion, dose-limiting toxicity was
defined as grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 days or with sepsis
or fever, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicity. Toxicities were graded according to
the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). The starting
doses were area under the curve (AUC) 6 mg/mL/min
(Calvert formula) for carboplatin and 200 mg/m2 for
paclitaxel with a planned dose reduction for subsequent
patients in the phase 2 portion to AUC 5 mg/mL/min for
carboplatin and 175 mg/m2 for paclitaxel if the first dose
was intolerable in at least 2 of 6 patients. Cycles were
repeated every 3 weeks.
Dose Modifications

For subsequent treatment courses in patients with toxicities meeting the aforementioned criteria for dose-limiting
toxicity, dose reductions (25% of the dose of paclitaxel
and decreases of 1 mg/mL/min in the AUC dose of carboplatin) were planned as long as a clinical benefit could be
documented. Paclitaxel was discontinued for grade 3 or
worse peripheral neuropathy. Dose reductions of Reolysin
were to be undertaken only for moderate to severe symptoms not attributable to chemotherapy, such as flulike
symptoms, rhinorrhea, and diarrhea. For these events, the
Reolysin dose was decreased to 1 3 1010 TCID50. In the
absence of intolerable toxicity or tumor progression, the
combination regimen was given for 4 to 6 cycles (according to physician preference), and this was followed by
Reolysin as single-agent maintenance with the same
schedule of 5 days every 3 weeks.
Study Endpoints

The primary endpoint was the ORR (complete response 1 PR) as per a RECIST 1.0 CT response16 or at least a
877

Original Article

40% reduction of uptake in PET-avid lesions.17 CT was
performed at the baseline and after every 2 cycles for all
patients, whereas PET was introduced in this fashion, after an amendment, for the last 26 patients. Secondary
endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, and tolerability.
Statistical Methods

Exact binomial confidence intervals (CIs) for the ORR
were calculated to summarize the primary endpoint for all
response-evaluable patients and by subgroup.18 Survival
endpoints were summarized with the methods of Kaplan
and Meier,19 with Brookmeyer-Crowley CIs used for the
median survival time and with Greenwood’s method used
for 6- and 12-month survival estimates. PFS was defined
from the date of study entry to the date of disease progression. Patients who withdrew from the study, were lost to
follow-up, died without progressive disease, or began alternative treatments before progression was noted were
censored on the date of withdrawal, last follow-up, or new
treatment initiation. OS was determined as the time from
study entry to the date of death or was censored on the
date on which a patient was last known to be alive. The
final review was completed on March 15, 2015. All
analyses were unadjusted for multiple comparisons and
were performed with STATA (version 13.1; StataCorp,
College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Screening

Patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC who were
found with a routine EGFR amplification/KRAS mutation assessment performed at OSU-PCF were referred for
participation in the study. From March 2009 to February
2013, 37 patients were enrolled at the Ohio State University Medical Center (n 5 33) and Georgetown University
Medical Center (n 5 4). The characteristics of these
patients are depicted in Table 1. The majority of tumors
had an adenocarcinoma histology (n 5 27), which
reflected the association of testing for KRAS and EGFR
mutations with adenocarcinomas; 2 patients with a mixed
adenosquamous histology, 1 patient with squamous carcinomas, and 1 patient with a bronchioloalveolar histology
were also enrolled. Six patients had NSCLC that was not
otherwise specified. KRAS mutations were present in 20
patients, whereas EGFR amplification alone was present
in 10 patients. Three patients’ tumors exhibited EGFRactivating mutations, and 4 patients’ tumors (all EGFRamplified) also had concurrent BRAF-V600E mutations.

Dose Evaluation and Toxicities

Two patients were treated at the starting doses of AUC 6
for carboplatin, 200 mg/m2 for paclitaxel, and 3 3 1010
TCID50 for Reolysin, and both experienced unacceptable
toxicities (febrile neutropenia in one and grade 3 diarrhea
in the other). These patients were dose-reduced for subsequent cycles to AUC 5 for carboplatin and 175 mg/m2 for
paclitaxel; Reolysin was kept at 3 3 1010 TCID50 as previously planned, and these starting doses were used for all
subsequently enrolled patients. Overall, 242 cycles
(including 105 for Reolysin-only maintenance) were
administered to the 37 patients (median, 4; range, 1-47).
Chemotherapy was further reduced because of adverse
events for only 6 additional patients (17%; 18 of 240
cycles or 8%). Only 1 patient had to reduce the Reolysin
dose; more than 95% of planned doses were administered

at the full dose over the course of the study. The type,
grade, and frequency of the toxicities observed with the
combination are depicted in Table 2. The combination at
the reduced doses was generally well tolerated. The most
frequent moderate to severe toxicities included fatigue (8
patients with grade 3, 1 patient with grade 4), neutropenia
(7 patients with grade 3, 1 patient with grade 4), diarrhea
(5 patients with grade 3), and nausea/vomiting (3 patients
with grade 3). Four patients developed hypotension, and
2 patients developed confusion. Fever was noted only
during Reolysin-only maintenance.
Antitumor Activity

Table 3 depicts the best response according to RECIST
tumor assessment results, the percentage change in the
standardized uptake value (SUV) maximum sum of tumor lesions on PET scans performed after 2 cycles versus
the baseline, and PFS and OS according to molecular and
histologic characteristics. Two patients were not evaluable
for a response because of consent withdrawal shortly after
they had received 1 cycle. Eleven of 35 evaluable patients
had a RECIST response; all were partial (ORR, 31%;
90% 1-sided lower CI, 21%) as assessed by investigators
and were confirmed at a 4-week scan. Twenty patients
had stable disease (SD) as their best response, whereas 4
patients experienced disease progression on their first
postbaseline assessment. The percentage of patients who
Cancer

March 15, 2016

had a RECIST PR with a KRAS tumor genotype (5 PRs
among 18 evaluable patients) and the percentage of
patients who had a PR with an EGFR amplification–alone
tumor genotype (3 PRs among 10 evaluable patients)
were similar (odds ratio of EGFR amplification alone vs
KRAS, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.20-6.11; P 5 .90). Two PRs
occurred among 4 patients with BRAF-mutated tumors
(50%; 95% CI, 7%-93%). Twenty-four patients had
PET scans performed simultaneously with the CT assessments, before treatment, and after every 2 cycles. Ten of
these patients (6 with PRs and 4 with SD according to
RECIST) had a > 40% decrease in the SUV sum of the
lesions after 2 cycles. No significant increases in SUV
were observed after 2 cycles in any of the patients treated.
Thus, the RECIST 1 PET ORR was 43% (90% 1-sided
lower CI, 31%).
The median PFS, OS, and 12-month OS rate were 4
months (95% CI, 2.9-6.1 months), 13.1 months (95%
CI, 9.2-21.6 months), and 57% (95% CI, 39%-72%),
respectively (Table 3). Ten patients went on to receive
Reolysin-only maintenance after 4 to 6 cycles of the combination, whereas 3 patients opted to switch to pemetrexed maintenance at the completion of paclitaxel,
carboplatin, and Reolysin without progression or significant toxicity, and 1 patient (carrying an EGFR-activating
mutation) was switched to erlotinib after 6 cycles. These
patients were censored at the time of the switch to the

alternative therapy for the PFS calculations. KaplanMeier PFS and OS plots according to the molecular phenotype are depicted in Figures 2 and 3. Seven patients
were alive after a median follow-up of 34.2 months
(range, 26.9-71.5 months); they included 2 patients (with
an EGFR mutation and a KRAS G12 mutation) with no
evidence of disease progression to date (37 and 50
months, respectively; Table 3).

gators’ assessment was significantly increased (31%; 90%
1-sided lower CI, 21%) in comparison with the assumed
historical response rate for paclitaxel and carboplatin
alone (20%). However, the firmness of historical data is
limited, and the comparison being used here is
hypothesis-generating because the prognostic or predictive value of KRAS mutations is still a matter of debate.
Studies in early-stage disease offer contradictory information.22-24 The First-Line Erbitux in Lung Cancer (FLEX)
study, performed with patients with metastatic NSCLC,
randomized EGFR-expressing patients by immunohistochemistry to receive either cisplatin and vinorelbine or
this chemotherapy in combination with cetuximab.25 OS,
but not PFS, was better for the cetuximab-containing
arm. In a retrospective molecular characterization study
that used tumors from patients in the FLEX trial,26 the
response rate for patients with KRAS mutations was
36.8% for patients receiving cetuximab and chemotherapy and 21.6% for those receiving chemotherapy alone.
PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI, 3.1-6.9 months) for cetuximab and chemotherapy and 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.85.8 months) for patients with KRAS mutations receiving
chemotherapy alone. However, OS was only 8.9 months
for the combination versus 11.1 months for chemotherapy alone. In the group of patients enrolled with evidence
of EGFR amplification by FISH, the response rates were
36.7% and 26.4% for the cetuximab/chemotherapy and
chemotherapy arms, respectively, whereas PFS was 4.2
and 4.4 months and OS was 11.6 and 9.9 months for the
cetuximab/chemotherapy and chemotherapy arms,
respectively.

DISCUSSION
A systematic evaluation of tumor genetics in NSCLC has
led to the identification of tumor drivers and, in some
cases, to effective targeted therapies. Notable examples are
EGFR mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocations, for which several targeted agents are available
for clinical use.20,21 KRAS constitutive activation has
been more challenging; this has led some to conclude that
it is not a druggable target. The preclinical data for the
Reolysin virus showing selectivity for Ras have, therefore,
high appeal for an evaluation in Ras-activated NSCLC
patients. The Ras pathway can be activated through an
upstream event, such as EGFR mutations and amplification, or through a downstream event, such as BRAF mutations. This study included a group of patients with diverse
molecular aberrations that had the common denominator
of Ras activation, and it showed good feasibility for the
population-enriched approach undertaken as well as a
good safety profile for the combination of Reolysin with
chemotherapy in this population.
In this study, the RECIST response rate for paclitaxel, carboplatin, and Reolysin according to the investiCancer

Original Article

Although the response rate (31% according to
RECIST) and the median survival rate (13.1 months) for
our trial compare favorably with those for the
chemotherapy-alone arm in the FLEX trial, the lack of a
randomized control group in our trial does not allow us to
make firm interpretations of superior antitumor efficacy
for the approach tested in this study. Furthermore, we did
not observe significant differences in clinical outcomes for
patients enrolled according to the genotype leading to Ras
activation (Figs. 2 and 3), and because of the lack of a
non–Ras-activated control cohort, we could not confirm
or reject the utility of Ras activation as a predictor of Reolysin/chemotherapy activity.
Significant increases in neutralizing antireoviral
antibodies (median, 250-fold) have been demonstrated in
humans with advanced cancers after exposure to Reolysin,27 and coadministration of cyclophosphamide was
shown not to be able to attenuate the host antiviral
response to a reovirus.28 However, despite the presence of
neutralizing antibodies, it has been demonstrated that a
reovirus can evade neutralization by associating with peripheral blood mononuclear cells for up to 10 days after
treatment in patient samples.28,29 Further demonstration
of the ability of a reovirus to escape neutralization can be
found in the persistence of an infectious, replicating virus
in patient tumor samples at various periods up to weeks
after reovirus administration despite the presence of neutralization antibodies. Infectious reoviruses have been isolated from various solid tumor types after systemic
administration, including ovarian cancer, melanoma,
pleural mesothelioma, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer,
colon cancer, and head and neck cancer,10,12,29-33 and
from hematopoietic malignancies such as multiple
myeloma.34
Thus, it is very tempting to speculate on the potential for Reolysin to create immunogenicity against the tumor cells infiltrated by the virus. This response could
theoretically be capable of bypassing operating mechanisms of immune tolerance and result in longer survival.
The current study was designed for patients to receive
maintenance reovirus alone after initial induction with
Reolysin and chemotherapy; this was done except for the
4 patients who switched to pemetrexed or erlotinib for
maintenance. An intriguing and potentially better
approach could be the use of a checkpoint inhibitor in
that setting, which could benefit from the immunogenicity created by the virus during the induction phase. In
support of this hypothesis, CD81-enriched splenocytes
have been shown to secrete augmented levels of
interferon-c when they are cocultured with Reolysin ver882

sus an ultraviolet-inactivated reovirus; this indicates reovirus recognition by CD81 cells and proinflammatory
response stimulation through interferon-c secretion.35
Furthermore, therapy combining a reovirus with programmed death 1 blockade has been shown to produce a
significant survival benefit by augmenting tumor-specific
natural killer responses and specifically attenuating
tumor-specific immunosuppression.36
In summary, Reolysin in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin was well tolerated, and the observed
response rate met study specifications. A randomized trial
that could elucidate both the contribution of Reolysin to
the effect of chemotherapy and the utility of a predictive
biomarker is planned. It would be interesting to explore
serum immune response markers as well as tumor biopsy
before and after Reolysin therapy to evaluate the extent of
tumor infiltration with markers of an immune response
such as Fox-P31 regulatory T cells. Because of the benefits
shown with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in lung
cancer and the intriguing data of immune stimulation after viral exposure, a study combining the 2 approaches
would be an exciting follow-up study.
