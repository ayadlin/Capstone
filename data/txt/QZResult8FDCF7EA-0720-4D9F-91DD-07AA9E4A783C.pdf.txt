ABSTRACT
miR-27a regulates cell differentiation in a variety of diseases. However, whether
and how miR-27a participates in laryngeal cancer cell differentiation remains
unknown. Therefore, we explored role and molecular mechanism of miR-27a in
laryngeal cancer differentiation in the study. We found that miR-27a expression was
inversely correlated with laryngeal cancer differentiation degree based on the clinical
pathological diagnosis of each patient. miR-27 asignificantly rescued differentiation
and inhibited β-catenin, LEF1, OCT4 and SOX2 in Wnt/β-catenin pathway in all-transretinoic acid (ATRA)-induced laryngeal cancer cells. Bindings of RARα to miR-27a
and miR-27a to GSK-3β were confirmed by ChIP and Luciferase reporter assays,
respectively. In conclusion, miR-27a is a negative regulator in laryngeal cancer
differentiation. RARα-mediated miR-27a transcriptional inactivation releases the
inhibition of miR-27a on GSK-3β leading to laryngeal cancer differentiation through
GSK-3β-involved Wnt/β-catenin pathway, suggesting that miR-27a is a usefully
therapeutic target at least in ATRA-induced laryngeal cancer differentiation.

INTRODUCTION

pathways. In retinoid-inducing differentiation, GSK3β coordinates the crosstalk between the PI3K/Akt and
Wnt/β-catenin pathways. ATRA and retinoic acid receptor
(RAR) complex inactivate Akt through PI3K/Akt pathway
and prevent GSK-3β from phosphorylation by Akt leading
to maintenance of GSK-3β activity [12]. GSK-3β then
phosphorylates β-catenin and promotes its degradation
mediated by ubiquitin in Wnt/β-catenin pathway [13]. As
a result, β-catenin cannot enter nuclear to transactivate
the differentiation inhibitors such as OCT4 and SOX2 via
TCF/LEF [14–16].
In addition, RAR also acts as a transcriptional factor.
Studies have shown that RAR regulates transcription of
target genes usually together with retinoid X receptor (RXR).
For example, GM-CSF/RA-induced RALDH2 transcription
in dendritic cells requires binding of cooperative RAR/RXR
complex to Sp1 sites of the RALDH2 promoter through
p38MAPK-associated pathway [17].

Abnormal differentiation is commonly found in
cancer [1, 2]. Studies have shown that cancer is initiated
and maintained by a subset of cancer cells, ‘the cancer
stem cells’, which are able to self-renew and differentiate
like normal stem cells presenting cell surface markers
[3–5]. Inducement of cancer cell differentiation has
become a promising strategy in modern antineoplastic
therapy [6]. Thus, study on molecular mechanism of
cancer differentiation is still a hotspot at present.
It is well-known that all-trans-retinoic acid
(ATRA) is a powerful agent commonly used in cancer
differentiation study [7–10]. Retinoid-involved signal is
often disrupted during carcinogenesis and restoration of
the signaling may be a viable option for cancer prevention
[11]. Retinoid induces cell differentiation through a lot
of signal pathways such as PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin

MicroRNA, a 20–23 nt functional RNA
molecule, is involved in some biological processes
including embryonic development and mammalian cell
differentiation [18]. It has been reported that miR-27a is an
important differentiation-associated regulator in a variety
of diseases [19–21]. However, whether and how miR-27a
participates in laryngeal cancer cell differentiation remains
unknown.
By prediction, we found that there exists a
potential retinoic acid response element (RARE) in the
miR-27a promoter whereas GSK-3β is a putative target
gene of miR-27a. We wonder miR-27a could regulate
differentiation through GSK-3β and RARα-related
signaling pathways.

approximately 15 μM. Because 5μM RA had relatively
low effect on Hep2 cell viability (Supplementary Figure 1)
and induced obvious laryngeal cancer cell differentiation
(Supplementary Figure 2), 5μM RA was used in the
following experiments.
Under light microscope, we then found that nontreated Hep2 cells cultured in vitro were shown to have
a polygon body with mass nucleocytoplasmic ratio and
rapid growth (Figure 2B, left) whereas long shuttle cell
bodies, cell marginal shrivel, small nucleocytoplasmic
ratio and slow growth were observed in the ATRAinduced Hep2 cells (Figure 2B, middle), which could
be blocked by miR-27a introduction (Figure 2B, right).
Moreover, significantly lower expression of OCT4 and
SOX2 and higher expression of Involucrin and Keratin10
at both mRNA and protein levels were found in Hep2 cells
treated with 5 μM RA for 48 h compared to the controls,
respectively. Nevertheless, the expression alterations of the
four markers could be restored by miR-27a (Figure 2C).
These results suggest a suppressive role of miR-27a in
ATRA-induced laryngeal cancer cell differentiation.

RESULTS
miR-27a expression is negatively associated with
differentiation degree in laryngeal cancer tissues
RT-qPCR result demonstrated that miR-27a
was up-regulated in 86% (43 of 50) cases of laryngeal
cancer (Figure 1A) and miR27a average expression was
significantly higher in LSCC tissue (4.131 ± 0.537) than
that in adjacent normal tissue (1.4201 ± 0.206) (Figure 1B,
P < 0.001), suggesting that miR-27a is involved in
laryngeal oncogenesis.
As shown in Figure 1C and Table 1, we found that
the higher miR-27a level in laryngeal carcinoma was,
the lower the differentiation degree was (poor, 8.016 ±
1.790; moderate, 3.843 ± 0.560; well, 2.136 ± 0.336),
which showed significant differences between miR27a expression and differentiation degree (P < 0.001),
indicating that miR-27a is a negative regulator in laryngeal
cancer differentiation.

Mir-27a directly targets GSK-3β and increases
expression of β-catenin and LEF1 in ATRAinduced Hep2 cells
Based on the bioinformatics analysis using different
programs, we found a highly-conserved miR-27a targeting
sequence in the GSK-3β 3'-untranslated region (Figure
3A), which suggests that GSK-3β mRNA is a candidate
target of miR-27a. Dual luciferase reporter assay result
displayed that luciferase activity was significantly reduced
in HEK293T and Hep2 cells when GSK-3β 3’UTR wildtype construct was cotransfected with miR-27a mimic
compared to the controls (Figure 3B). Western blot
and real-time RT-qPCR results showed that miR-27a
significantly decreased GSK-3β expression at protein
level but not at mRNA level (Figure 3C, left and middle),
respectively, implying that miR-27a represses GSK-3β
expression from post-transcriptional level. Moreover,
ATRA significantly increased the GSK3β gene expression,
which was restored by miR-27a (Figure 3C, right). These
results indicate that miR-27a directly inhibits GSK-3β in
ATRA-induced Hep2 cells.
Whether GSK-3β is a mediator in miR-27aregulated differentiation of laryngeal cancer cells induced
by ATRA is also a problem. As indicated in Figure 3D,
the GSK-3β gene was significantly knocked down at
both mRNA and protein levels in laryngeal cancer cells
transfected with si-GSK-3β compared to the control,
which means the GSK-3β gene is successfully silenced by
its small interference RNA. Similar to miR-27a, GSK-3β
kockdown significantly altered differentiation-associated
markers in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells (Figure 3E). These
suggest that miR-27a regulates ATRA-induced Hep2 cell
differentiation via down-regulating GSK-3β expression.

miR-27a resists ATRA-induced laryngeal cancer
cell differentiation
In order to explore whether miR-27a takes part in
laryngeal cancer cell differentiation, we first detected
effect of miR-27a on expression of stem cell markers and
differentiation-associated keratinocyte markers in nontreated Hep2 cells. RT-qPCR and Western blotting results
showed that miR-27a mimic significantly increased OCT4
and SOX2 expression both at mRNA and protein levels
in Hep2 cells compared to the mock, miR-27a inhibitor
and mimic NC, respectively. Conversely, miR-27a mimic
significantly reduced Involucrin and Keratin10 expression.
However, not all markers showed significant difference
between miR-27a inhibitor and inhibitor NC (Figure 2A).
These results imply that miR-27a potentially represses
laryngeal cancer cell differentiation.
We then explored effect of miR-27a on
differentiation in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells. As shown in
Supplementary Figure 1, RA concentration at IC50 was

We also assessed influence of miR-27a in expression
of β-catenin and LEF1 in Wnt/β-catenin signal in ATRAinduced Hep2 cells. We found that ATRA significantly
decreased β-catenin and LEF1 expression compared to
the controls, respectively, and such effects of ATRA were
significantly rescued by miR-27a (Figure 3F), indicating
that miR-27a increases β-catenin and LEF1 in ATRAinduced Hep2 cells.

(Figure 4B). By ChIP assay, we obtained a PCR product
including RARE site of miR-27a promoter from chromatin
fragment precipitated by anti-RARα antibody, which
confirms the direct binding of RARα to miR-27a promoter
region. Furthermore, RARα exhibited significantly strong
binding to RARE located within the miR-27a promoter in
ATRA-induced Hep2 cells compared to the controls (Figure
4C and 4D). Luciferase reporter assay result showed that
ATRA significantly decreased transcriptional activity of
the  miR-27a promoter containing RARE compared to
the controls and si-RARα significantly rescued the effect
(Figure 4E), indicating that ATRA/RARα negatively
regulate miR-27a transcriptional activity.
Collectively, these results above implied that ATRA
promotes RARα binding to miR-27a promoter, leading to
miR-27a transcription inhibition.

RARα contributes to transcriptional silence
of miR-27a in ATRA-induced laryngeal
cancer cell differentiation.
Interestingly, we found that miR-27a level was
significantly lower in ATRA-treated Hep2 cells in a dosedependent manner compared to the controls (Figure 4A).
Therefore, how ATRA downregulates miR-27a expression
is the other issue we have to solve in the study.
It is well-known that RARα is an important receptor
of ATRA. According to bioinformatics prediction, we found
a potential RARE site in the miR-27a gene promoter region

In recent years, miR-27a has been a new star in

miR-27a is a critical differentiation regulator in various
kinds of cells such as myofibroblast [22], embryonic
stem cell (ESC) [23], adipocyte [24], osteoblast [25],
myoblast [26], erythroid [27] and breast cancer cells [28].
Except for breast cancer, role of miR-27a in other cancer
differentiation is seldom reported. In addition, whether

miR-27a affects ATAR-induced differentiation is not
reported either.
In the study, we found that miR-27a overexpression
is negatively associated with differentiation degree in
laryngeal cancer tissues and suppresses differentiation of
Hep2 cells mediated by ATRA. miR-27a also maintains

OCT4 and SOX2 expression and suppresses Involucrin
and Keratin10 expression in ATRA-treated and -untreated
Hep2 cells. These findings suggest that miR-27a inhibits
laryngeal cancer differentiation.
Same to our findings, miR-27a represses
differentiation in lung fibroblast [22], ESC [23] and
adipocyte [24]. However, miR-27a is also found to promote

osteoblast [25], myoblast [26], erythroid [27] and breast
cancer stem like cell differentiation [28].These indicates
that miR-27a has dual effects on differentiation in different
kinds of cells via targeting various of genes through
different signal pathways. For examples, miR-27a targets
α-smooth muscle actin, Smad2 and Smad4 to inhibit lung
fibroblast differentiation [22]. miR-27a prevents adipocyte

sFRP1 in canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling [25].

Studies have shown that ATRA promotes

leading to activation of Msk1 whereas phosphorylated

Msk1 recruits transcription factors such as RARα to the
promoter region of their targets [29, 30]. In the study,
we found that RARα directly binds to the miR-27a gene
promoter region and decrease its transcription activity
in Hep2 cells. We speculate that RARα directly inhibits
miR-27a transcription probably via p38MAPK-involved
pathway.
As indicated in the Introduction, ATRA/RARα
maintains GSK-3β activity though PI3K/Akt pathway
and promotes differentiation via GSK-3β-involved Wnt/

β-catenin pathway. In Wnt/β-catenin pathway, GSK-3β
blocks translocation of β-catenin to nuclear to activate
differentiation inhibitors such as OCT4 and SOX2 through
LEF1 leading to differentiation.
In the study, we found that miR-27a itself directly
binds to GSK-3β 3′-UTR in both HEK293T and Hep2
cells and inhibits the gene expression in Hep2 cells.
Interestingly, ATRA also decreased the expression of
miR-27a.Whereas in ATRA-treated Hep2 cells, the
RARα, GSK-3β, Involucrin and Keratin10 genes are

upregulated and β-catenin, LEF1, OCT4 and SOX2 genes
are downregulated. Moreover, the expression alterations of
these genes can be reversed by miR-27a in ATRA-induced
Hep2 cells, indicating that miR-27a blocks ATRA-induced
Hep2 cell differentiation through GSK-3β-mediated Wnt/
β-catenin pathway by direct target to GSK-3β.
In conclusion, miR-27a plays a suppressive role
in laryngeal cancer differentiation. ATRA enhances the
suppressive role of RARα on miR-27a promoter and
release the inhibition of miR-27a on GSK-3β leading to
laryngeal cancer differentiation through GSK-3β-involved
Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Figure 5). We believe that miR27a is a usefully therapeutic target at least in ATRA-induced
laryngeal cancer differentiation.

ChIP
Hep-2 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde
for 10 min. ChIP assay was performed by using anti-RARα
antibody (Abcam) and ChIP assay kit (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was used
as negative control. Bound DNA fragments were subjected
to quantitative-PCR or PCR detection using the primer
pair shown in Table 2. PCR products were separated by
electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel.
