Abstract
Panels of prognostic biomarkers selected using candidate approaches often do not validate in independent
populations, so additional strategies are needed to identify reliable classiﬁers. In this study, we used an arraybased approach to measure DNA methylation and applied a novel method for grouping CpG dinucleotides
according to well-characterized genomic sequence features. A hypermethylation proﬁle among 13 CpG loci,
characterized by polycomb group target genes, mammalian interspersed repeats, and transcription factor–
binding sites (PcG/MIR/TFBS), was associated with reduced survival (HR, 3.98; P ¼ 0.001) in patients with head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma. This association was driven by CpGs associated with the TAP1 and ALDH3A1
genes, ﬁndings that were validated in an independent patient group (HR, 2.86; P ¼ 0.04). Together, the data not
only elucidate new potential targets for therapeutic intervention in head and neck cancer but also may aid
in the identiﬁcation of poor prognosis patients who may require more aggressive treatment regimens. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) arises
from the mucosal lining of the larynx, pharynx, and oral cavity.
More than 40,000 new cases develop annually in the United
States, and despite advances in treatment regimens, 5-year
survival rates near 50% have declined only modestly over the
past 30 years (1). The major determinants of patient prognosis
include patient age, tumor stage and site, lifetime duration of
alcohol/tobacco exposure, and oncogenic human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) infection, although these do not fully inform
patient outcome and are used conservatively in treatment
planning (2). Identiﬁcation of additional prognostic molecular
biomarkers is needed to provide clinicians with better theraAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The

peutic decision-making tools. Candidate gene approaches have
been used in past studies of head and neck cancer to identify
additional biomarkers of prognosis, although their results have
almost uniformly been poorly replicated in independent studies (3–5). Thus, using discovery-based approaches coupled
with appropriate validation may provide novel markers of
greater use.
Epigenetic silencing of genes via promoter hypermethylation is a critical event in the development of many cancers,
including HNSCCs (6–9). Because of the inherent stability of 5methylcytosine, DNA methylation is an attractive epigenetic
indicator for measurement. Consistent with studies of candidate genetic markers, candidate studies using DNA methylation as a predictive tool have uncovered novel biomarkers of
survival (10). However, many prior studies suffer from a limited
ability to detect strong overall survival associations and these
identiﬁed associations may vary widely among different populations (11–13). Heterogeneous patterns of somatic alterations
across tumors can decrease the use of single candidate genes as
biomarkers, and molecular proﬁle–based markers that address
this challenge are increasingly pursued.
Previous studies by our group and others have shown that
proﬁles of cancer-related epigenetic alterations are dependent
upon the local genomic architecture (11, 14–16). In fact, Lienert
and colleagues (17) recently described methylation-determining regions of short DNA fragments whose sequence content
[CpG density, transcription factor–binding sites (TFBS)] largely deﬁnes methylation patterning in mouse embryonic stem
cells. Therefore, we compared DNA methylation grouped by
speciﬁc sets of phenotypically well-understood DNA sequence
elements to ask whether methylation proﬁles of these sets were
associated with the survival times of patients with HNSCCs. We
measured methylation genome-wide, at more than 26,377 CpG

loci, and deﬁned novel groups of loci on the basis of their
proximity to functional sequence elements.

Materials and Methods
Samples and study population
The initial discovery phase study population has been
previously described (18) and an independent validation population was drawn from Boston-area hospitals between 2003
and 2007, in an extension of the original case–control study of
HNSCCs. Tumor samples (encompassing all head and neck
sites except nasopharyngeal carcinomas) from incident cases
were microscopically examined by the study pathologist and
histologically conﬁrmed to have more than 70% tumor content.
Patients were enrolled after providing written, informed consent, as approved by all of the participating Institutional
Review Boards. Clinical information was collected and HPV16
status assessed using short-fragment PCR to amplify a region
of the L1 gene of HPV16, according to previously published
methods (19). In total, 91 fresh-frozen tumor specimens from
the discovery patient population and 101 formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tumors from the validation population
were subjected to methylation analysis. All-cause patient
survival data were obtained from the National Death Index
and survival was tracked for 8 years after diagnosis when
possible.
DNA isolation and methylation array procedures
DNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tumors and 18 clinically
normal head and neck tissues sourced from the National Disease
Research Interchange using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit
(Qiagen) or from 20-mm FFPE sections according to previously
published procedures (20). One microgram of genomic DNA was
sodium bisulﬁte–modiﬁed using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit
(Zymo Research) as per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA
methylation was measured in the discovery patient population
on a genome-wide scale using the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation27 Microarray Platform (Illumina). This BeadChip
assay measures methylation (21), given as a b-value ranging
from 0 to 1, at more than 27,000 CpG loci. Arrays were processed
at the University of California San Francisco (San Francisco, CA)
Institute for Human Genetics, Genomics Core Facility, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data were assembled in
BeadStudio without normalization, as recommended by the
manufacturer. Control probes were used to assess sample
performance. Speciﬁcally, the multivariate characteristics of
array control probes based on ﬁtted mean vector and variance–covariance matrix (Mahalanobis distance) were used to
screen for outlying samples (although none were found). Sex
chromosomal loci (n ¼ 1,092) were excluded to avoid genderspeciﬁc methylation bias. As single-nucleotide polymorphisms
near the interrogated CpG site are known to induce spurious
signals in the Illumina platforms, we excluded an additional 109
probes, which resulted in a ﬁnal data set of 26,377 autosomal loci
associated with 13,856 genes.
Statistical analysis
Methylation data were analyzed in R statistical software
v2.8.1 (http://www.r-project.org). Differential methylation

www.aacrjournals.org

(hypermethylation/hypomethylation) was determined by
comparing the distributions of the methylation b-values for
each locus between tumor samples and normal tissue. A
nonparametric Cox–Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to
determine signiﬁcance (false discovery rate, q < 0.05), and a
threshold of |Db| > 0.2 was imposed to identify potentially
meaningful biologic changes. All 26,377 autosomal array CpG
loci were clustered into mutually exclusive groups on the basis
of the following genomic functional sequence element criteria:
CpG island status (ref. 22; obtained from the array annotation
ﬁle), polycomb group (PcG) target status of the gene associated
with the CpG [i.e., gene was described as a PcG target in at least
one of the study of Bracken and colleagues (23), Lee and
colleagues (24), Schlesinger and colleagues (25), or Squazzo
and colleagues (26)], presence within 1 kb of, at least, one of 258
computationally predicted TFBS [sequences obtained from the
tfbsConsSites track of the UCSC Genomes Table Browser
(NCBI36/hg18 assembly, TFBS z-score > 2)], and presence
within any of the following types of repetitive element as
deﬁned by the Repeatmasker v3.2.7 track within Genomes
Browser: Alu, LINE-1, LINE-2, and MIR sequences. Methylation
array b-values were averaged across all CpG loci within each
bioinformatic class to generate an aggregate methylation value
and tumors were grouped into high/intermediate/low categories depending on whether their speciﬁc methylation level was
in the highest, middle, or lowest tertile across the population
for each class.
Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to determine class-speciﬁc (and locus-speciﬁc) associations between
methylation groups and prognosis and were controlled for
patient age at diagnosis, anatomic site, combined American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, and HPV16 status.
The null distribution of the 41-dimensional Cox z-statistic was
obtained by randomly permuting aggregate methylation values
with respect to the survival variables 10,000 times. Note here
that the response variable is survival and the predictor is that of
tumor methylation. An omnibus test of signiﬁcance, analogous
to a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, was conducted by comparing
the observed maximum for 41 z-scores with the corresponding
quantity over the permutation distribution. We tested for
univariate associations between epidemiologic factors and
high/intermediate/low categorical tumor methylation using
nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA tests for continuous
variables and a 10,000-permutation c2 test for categorical
variables. An association was considered signiﬁcant where P
< 0.05.
Locus speciﬁcity and array validation
To determine the speciﬁcity of individual CpG locus methylation associations with patient outcomes, we assessed methylation at sites proximal to the index CpG loci (ALDH3A1 and
TAP1). CpG loci in different bioinformatic groups or in nearby
genes were compared, using Spearman rho, for their concordance with the index CpG, using the array CpG methylation
values. Pyrosequencing assays were designed for the top 2 CpG
loci (corresponding to ALDH3A1 and TAP1 genes), which were
associated with survival. Pyrosequencing reactions were conducted in triplicate according to the procedures described by

Bollati and colleagues (27), with the following modiﬁcations:
the annealing temperatures were 62 C-ALDH3A1/55.5 C-TAP1
and 47 (rather than 45) cycles were used in the case of
ALDH3A1. Primers for this assay are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Sodium bisulﬁte conversion efﬁciency was
monitored using internal non-CpG cytosine residues using the
PyroMark Q96MD System. DNA methylation at each locus was
calculated by taking the percentage of methylated signal
divided by the sum of the methylated and unmethylated signals
for each CpG. Nonparametric Spearman correlations were
calculated between array CpG methylation and bisulﬁte pyrosequencing values. Tertile groups of methylation were determined across all tumors (within each data set) for each CpG
and tumors were stratiﬁed into low-, intermediate-, or highmethylation groups, depending on their tertile membership.
Survival was compared among groups using a log-rank test.
DNA methylation of TAP1 and ALDH3A1 loci were assessed
in the independent validation patient set of 101 FFPE tumors.
Pyrosequencing values of both loci were aggregated together
(averaged) for each tumor, and patient survival was compared
across methylation tertiles. Cox models were used to adjust
associations for clinical and demographic factors.

Results
Bioinformatically clustered CpG loci are associated with
patient survival
We determined the methylation state of 91 discovery phase
HNSCCs at all 26,377 autosomal loci using the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation27 Microarray. The methylation
b-distribution of this data set is shown in Supplementary Fig.
S1, where each CpG locus is averaged across all 91 tumors.
Given the enrichment of promoter and early exonic CpG loci in
this array, a large proportion of loci in this array are unmethylated (45% of all CpGs where b < 0.10) whereas a small

proportion are highly methylated (0.5% of CpGs where b >
0.90). To identify CpG loci whose altered methylation is associated with prognosis, we used a supervised approach that
leverages genomic architecture to inform locus selection. Array
CpG loci were bioinformatically clustered on the basis of
phenotypically well-understood DNA sequence elements into
41 mutually exclusive groups. Speciﬁcally, CpGs were clustered
on the basis of their presence within LINE-1, LINE-2, Alu, or MIR
repeats, CpG islands, genes that are known targets of PcG
proteins, or within 1,000 bp of TFBS. Individual CpGs were only
allowed to be members of a single bioinformatically derived
cluster. We hypothesized that this approach would attenuate
biochemical and biologic noise and reduce false discovery, thus
providing increased power to detect signiﬁcant associations
with survival. Table 1 lists the DNA sequence elements that
deﬁne each of the 41 CpG clusters and provides the number of
CpGs in each cluster. Indicative of a preference for gene-rich
regions in the array design, a single group of CpGs deﬁned by
being located in a CpG island and near a TFBS (CpGI|TFBS)
contains nearly half of all autosomal array CpG loci. The
remaining CpG loci were spread unevenly across the other
bioinformatically derived clusters and 6% of CpG loci were not
associated with any sequence elements that deﬁned our
clusters.
To investigate the relationship between these proﬁles of
DNA methylation alterations and patient prognosis, we determined the average methylation value across all CpGs (aggregate methylation) among bioinformatic clusters for each of the
tumor samples. For every bioinformatic cluster, tumors were
sorted into high, intermediate, or low methylation subgroups,
depending on whether their methylation level (among member
CpG loci) fell into the highest, middle, or lowest tertile,
respectively. An omnibus test for signiﬁcance indicated that,
across bioinformatic clusters, methylation was signiﬁcantly

Figure 1. Cox survival scores for all bioinformatically derived clusters. Inﬁnium array CpG loci were clustered into 41 groups on the basis of local sequence
context. The cluster denoted by ( ) contains 1,636 loci that are not proximal to any of the functional elements used for clustering. For each cluster, the
average methylation across all member loci for all tumors was calculated (represented by point color). Tumors were stratiﬁed into high, intermediate, and low
methylation depending on each tumor's methylation within each cluster, and the dichotomous high/low group status was used as the predictor
in a Cox proportional hazards model. Cluster-speciﬁc Cox scores are plotted for the unadjusted model (n ¼ 90 with complete survival data; A) and Cox model
adjusted for age, site, stage, and HPV16 status (n ¼ 70; B). Dashed red lines represent the upper boundary for the 95% conﬁdence limit of the null permutation
distribution. The omnibus P value indicates the overall signiﬁcance level of the association between survival and methylation over all bioinformatic clusters of

associated with patient survival (permutation test, P ¼
0.0037; Fig. 1A). This association was robust to potential
confounding variables such as age at diagnosis, anatomic site,
combined AJCC stage, and HPV16 status (permutation, P ¼
0.021; Fig. 1B). In the latter model, the power to detect
signiﬁcant differences in survival times, based on methylation
of locus clusters, was diminished because of incomplete clinical data, however the effect remained signiﬁcant.
To characterize the methylation state of the tumors in each
patient subgroup, we compared the number of CpG loci that
were differentially methylated with normal head and neck
tissues (Supplementary Fig. S2) and found that the ratios of
hypomethylated/hypermethylated CpGs were signiﬁcantly different across patient subgroups (permutation, P < 0.001). The
top differentially methylated sites within each group are
described in Supplementary Table S2.

(PcG|MIR|TFBS; Fig. 1) was consistently associated with prognosis in these aggregate models. The aggregate methylation
value for this group (b ¼ 0.52) was signiﬁcantly higher than the
mean across all clusters (average ¼ 0.43, range ¼ 0.11–0.71).
Many of the genes associated with the 13 CpG loci in this
cluster (described in Table 2) are involved in the maintenance
of cellular homeostasis or possess tumor-suppressive function.
To assess possible bias or confounding arising from the
characteristics of individual patients, we compared clinical
and demographic factors of the patients in the low-, intermediate-, and high-methylation groups (Table 3). Notably, no
signiﬁcant differences in age at diagnosis, gender, HPV16
status, tumor site, tumor stage, drinking, or smoking exposures
were observed.
We next asked whether the DNA methylation level within
this cluster of 13 PcG|MIR|TFBS-member loci was associated
with patient survival times. Kaplan–Meier analysis (Fig. 2)
revealed a signiﬁcant difference in overall survival among the
patient methylation groups by taking into account all loci in
this class (log-rank; P ¼ 0.0003). The median survival time of
patients in the high-methylation group was 1.2 years with 13%

of patients alive at 8 years, as compared with a 50% 8-year
survivorship and a median survival time of 5.9 years in the lowmethylation group. In addition, the patient group with intermediate-methylation showed intermediate survival times. A
Cox proportional hazards analysis, adjusted for age at diagnosis, tumor site, tumor stage, and HPV16 status, showed that
patients in the high DNA methylation group had signiﬁcantly
decreased survival times [HR, 3.98; 95% conﬁdence interval
(CI), 1.8–8.9; Table 4]. Because of potential differences in
treatment regimens of low- versus high-stage disease that may
inﬂuence survival times within and each patient methylation
subgroup, we conducted a stratiﬁed subset analysis and found
that survival times did not signiﬁcantly vary by stage within any
of the high-, intermediate-, or low-methylation subgroups (logrank; P ¼ 0.43, 0.33, 0.98, respectively).

each of the 13 PcG|MIR|TFBS CpG loci (Supplementary Table

0.001 and P < 0.02); we therefore selected these loci for
conﬁrmation by pyrosequencing all of the tumors of the
discovery set with available DNA (88 of 91). Methylation values
determined by pyrosequencing were highly concordant with
array measurements at both loci (Spearman correlation ¼ 0.88
and 0.86) and survival associations were validated (log-rank; P

¼ 0.003 and 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S3). To determine the
speciﬁcity of this survival association for CpG loci in the PcG|
MIR|TFBS cluster, array methylation values for ALDH3A1 and
LMO2 CpGs were compared with those of loci within the same
genes but clustered into a separate PcG|TFBS group (LMO2 is
examined here as there were no additional TAP1 CpGs with
which to compare methylation in any other bioinformatic
groups). Despite a close proximity of the ALDH3A1 CpG pairs
and LMO2 CpGs pairs (100 bp for each gene), methylation
concordance was poor (Spearman correlation ¼ 0.29 and 0.62),
and proximal CpG methylation levels were not associated with
survival in either case (log-rank; P ¼ 0.53 and 0.97; Supplementary Fig. S4). Similarly, concordance of TAP1 and ALDH3A1
with neighboring gene loci (in ULK2 and PSMB9, respectively)
was low (Spearman correlation ¼ 0.14 and 0.14), and methylation of these CpGs were not associated with survival (logrank; P ¼ 0.17 and 0.57; Supplementary Fig. S5).
Methylation of TAP1 and ALDH3A1 independently

To validate the observed association with survival, we
further examined an additional 101 tumors drawn from an
independent tumor collection period. Bisulﬁte pyrosequencing
analysis of these tumors at the TAP1 and ALDH3A1 loci was
conducted, and aggregate methylation values were generated
for each tumor. Membership in the patient subgroup with the
highest methylation was independently poorly prognostic (HR,
2.86; 95% CI, 1.02–8.11; Fig. 3 and Table 4), validating the initial

Discussion
Epigenetic alterations, reﬂected in changes to the 5-methylcytosine content at speciﬁc genomic loci, are required for
normal cellular function and development. Candidate gene
approaches for identiﬁcation of prognostic biomarkers are
widely used by researchers, and studies have found that DNA
methylation alterations are associated with patient survival in a
number of cancers (11, 28–36), including HNSCCs. Head and
neck malignancies are often aggressive tumors with a poor

probability of survival, and there are few tools currently available
to assist the oncologist in determining long-term outcome in
these patients. Here, we used a genome-wide array to measure
DNA methylation in HNSCCs, identiﬁed markers of patient
survival time with a novel approach by clustering CpGs on the
basis of their association with local sequence features, and
validated the identiﬁed markers in an independent set of tumors.
Recently, investigations have revealed that, in addition to
aging and environment, the architecture of the genome itself
may predispose certain CpG sites to DNA methylation, both in
normal cells and in cancer (16, 37, 38). Therefore, methylation
proﬁling using genomically informed methodologies is an
attractive approach for identifying novel biomarkers. Here, we
have developed a unique method for classifying CpG loci that
allows functional sequence elements to dictate the clustering.
This technique has proven useful in deﬁning a novel

Prognostic Methylation in Head and Neck Cancers

product of) a stem cell–like tumor. Indeed, there is accumulating evidence that DNA hypermethylation is observed in
many cancers at the sites of polycomb-mediated gene repression in embryonic cells, which become relaxed during differentiation, and this methylation correlates with stem cell characteristics (39). In addition, a number of transcription factors
have been shown to be involved in the recruitment of DNA
methyltransferases to PcG target sites (39). Furthermore,
studies of aging-dependent methylation have shown that PcG
marking and frequency of coincident retrotransposable elements are both correlated and complementary (14). All of these
observations further support our result that the combination
of these sequence elements is critical in determining tumor
behavior.
Focusing on the individual gene members of the PcG|MIR|
TFBS cluster, we see that many of these are highly relevant to
head and neck disease. Chief among them is ALDH3A1, which is
expressed in the oral mucosa (40) and is a member of the
aldehyde dehydrogenase family of enzymes that convert the
carcinogenic intermediate of ethanol metabolism, acetaldehyde, into nontoxic acetic acid. As alcohol is a major risk factor
for the development of HNSCCs, one might expect alterations
of ALDH3A1 to play a role in the initiation and promotion of
malignancy. At the same time, this gene has been shown to
inhibit epithelial cell proliferation (41) and variant ALDH3A1
risk alleles are prevalent among breast cancer patients (42). In
addition, it is well known that aldehyde dehydrogenase is
involved in normal stem cell biology and is a functional marker
for epithelial cells with enhanced tumorigenic potential. A
recent publication showed enrichment for ALDH3 in the stem
cell populations of mammalian oral tissues (43). This supports
our hypothesis that alterations at PCG|MIR|TFBS-associated
genes deﬁne a more stem-like constitution of tumor cells that
engender more aggressive HNSCCs.
Downregulation of another gene represented in our PcG|
MIR|TFBS prognostic cluster, TAP1, allows HNSCC cells to
avoid immune surveillance by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (44)
and a lack of protein expression has recently been shown to
confer a negative prognostic risk in HNSCCs (45) as well as in
many other cancers. This study, however, did not include HPV
status in the survival analysis, so the question remained
whether downregulation was truly independently prognostic.
Another group reported that ectopic expression of TAP1 in
xenograft assays signiﬁcantly prolonged mouse survival time
and increased immune inﬁltrate (46). In addition, functional
investigations have revealed that this gene is downregulated in
primary HNSCCs (47, 48), metastasis (45), and HNSCC cell lines
(49), although promoter methylation was not previously
described in this setting. Together, these data suggest that
TAP1 may be a candidate for therapy in human HNSCCs.

Another gene marked by a CpG in the PcG|MIR|TFBS cluster
that was associated with HNSCC survival is the ankyrin-repeat
SOCS box-containing protein 2 (ASB2), which appears to be a
modulator of Notch signaling (50) and inhibits growth of
leukemic cells (51). However, its potential status as a tumor
suppressor in the head and neck has yet to be described. A
prominent tumor suppressor in the PcG|MIR|TFBS cluster is
CDKN1A, encoding the p21 (WAF1) protein that signals G1 cellcycle arrest or senescence. Two additional genes identiﬁed in
our analysis (SPOCK2 and NOPE) are known to be methylated
as potential biomarkers in cancer (52, 53). Consistent with our
observations, the genes represented by CpGs in the PcG|MIR|
TFBS group are primarily tumor suppressors, and one would
therefore expect that their inactivation through a combination
of hypermethylation and additional somatic alterations would
result in a poorer prognosis.
In summary, we have developed a novel technique to
identify clinical characteristics of HNSCCs using the genomic information of CpG loci coupled with epigenetic content
at those sites. In 2 independent populations, we show that
DNA methylation proﬁle markers may be used to identify
those at greatest risk of death, irrespective of HPV status.
The identiﬁcation of speciﬁc DNA methylation biomarkers,
such as those presented here, may assist in selecting patients
who are most likely to beneﬁt from tissue-sparing procedures and targeted therapies. It will be important to validate
this in other populations in an effort to move these biomarkers into clinical practice.
