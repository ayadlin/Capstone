SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Therapy development for adult diffuse glioma is hindered by incomplete knowledge of somatic
glioma driving alterations and suboptimal disease classification. We defined the complete set of
genes associated with 1,122 diffuse grade II-III-IV gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas and
used molecular profiles to improve disease classification, identify molecular correlations, and
provide insights into the progression from low- to high-grade disease. Whole genome sequencing
data analysis determined that ATRX but not TERT promoter mutations are associated with
increased telomere length. Recent advances in glioma classification based on IDH mutation and
1p/19q co-deletion status were recapitulated through analysis of DNA methylation profiles, which
identified clinically relevant molecular subsets. A subtype of IDH-mutant glioma was associated
with DNA demethylation and poor outcome; a group of IDH-wildtype diffuse glioma showed
molecular similarity to pilocytic astrocytoma and relatively favorable survival. Understanding of
cohesive disease groups may aid improved clinical outcomes.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Diffuse gliomas represent 80% of malignant brain tumors (Schwartzbaum et al., 2006).
Adult diffuse gliomas are classified and graded according to histological criteria
(oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, astrocytoma and glioblastoma; grade II to IV).
Although histopathologic classification is well established and is the basis of the WHO
classification of CNS tumors (Louis et al., 2007), it suffers from high intra- and interobserver variability, particularly amongst grade II-III tumors (van den Bent, 2010). Recent
molecular characterization studies have benefited from the availability of the datasets
generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Brennan et al., 2013; Eckel-Passow et al.,
2015; Frattini et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2015; TCGA_Network et al.,
2015), and have related genetic, gene expression and DNA methylation signatures with
prognosis (Noushmehr et al., 2010; Sturm et al., 2012; Verhaak et al., 2010). For example,
mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes 1 and 2 (IDH1/IDH2) define a distinct
subset of glioblastoma (GBM) with a hypermethylation phenotype (G-CIMP) with favorable
outcome (Noushmehr et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2009). Conversely, the absence of IDH
mutations in LGG marks a distinct IDH-wildtype subgroup characterized by poor, GBMlike prognosis (Eckel-Passow et al., 2015; TCGA_Network et al., 2015). Recent work by us

and others has proposed classification of glioma into IDH wildtype cases, IDH mutant
samples additionally carrying codeletion of chromosome arm 1p and 19q (IDH mutantcodel) and samples with euploid 1p/19q (IDH-mutant-non-codel), regardless of grade and
histology (Eckel-Passow et al., 2015; TCGA_Network et al., 2015). Mutation of the TERT
promoter, which has been reported with high frequency across glioma, may be an additional
defining feature. Current analyses have not yet clarified the relationships between LGGs and
GBMs that share common genetic hallmarks like IDH mutation or TERT promoter mutation
status. An improved understanding of these relationships will be necessary as we evolve
toward an objective genome-based clinical classification.

Author Manuscript

To address the above issues, we assembled a dataset comprising all TCGA newly diagnosed
diffuse glioma consisting of 1,122 patients, and comprehensively analyzed using sequencing
and array based molecular profiling approaches. We have addressed crucial technical
challenges in analyzing this comprehensive dataset, including the integration of multiple
platforms and data sources (e.g. multiple methylation and gene expression platforms). We
identified new diffuse glioma subgroups with distinct molecular and clinical features and
shed light on the mechanisms driving progression of LGG (WHO grades II and III) into fullblown GBM (WHO grade IV).

RESULTS
Patient cohort characteristics

Author Manuscript

The TCGA LGG and GBM cohorts consist of 516 and 606 patients, respectively.
Independent analysis of the GBM dataset was previously described, as was analysis of 290
LGG samples (Brennan et al., 2013; TCGA_Network et al., 2015). Two-hundred and
twenty-six LGG samples were added to our current cohort (Table 1). Clinical data including
age, tumor grade, tumor histology and survival was available for 93% (1046/1122) of cases
(Table S1). The majority of samples were grade IV tumors (n=590, 56%), while 216 (21%)
and 241 (23%) were grade II and III tumors, respectively. Similarly, 590 (56%) samples
were classified as GBM, 174 (17%) as oligodendroglioma, 169 (16%) as astrocytoma and
114 (11%) as oligoastrocytoma.
Amongst the data sources considered in our analysis were gene expression (n = 1,045),
DNA copy number (n = 1,084), DNA methylation (n = 932), exome sequencing (n = 820)
and protein expression (n = 473). Multiple and overlapping characterization assays were
employed (Table S1). All data files that were used in our analysis can be found at https://
tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/lgggbm_2015/.

Identification of novel glioma-associated genomic alterations
To establish the set of genomic alterations that drive gliomagenesis, we called point
mutations and indels on the exomes of 513 LGG and 307 GBM using the Mutect,
Indelocator, Varscan2 and RADIA algorithms, and considered all mutations identified by at
least two callers. Significantly mutated genes (SMGs) were determined using MutSigCV.
This led to the identification of seventy five SMGs, of which ten had been previously
reported in GBM (Brennan et al., 2013), twelve had been reported in LGG (TCGA_Network

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 January 28.

et al., 2015), and eight had been identified in both GBM and LGG studies. Forty five SMGs
have not been previously associated with glioma and ranged in mutation frequency from
0.5% to 2.6% (Table S2A). We used GISTIC2 to analyze the DNA copy number profiles of
1,084 samples, including 513 LGG and 571 GBM, and identified 162 significantly altered
DNA copy number segments (Table S2B). We employed PRADA and deFuse to detect
1,144 gene fusion events in the RNA-seq profiles available for 154 GBM and 513 LGG
samples, of which 37 in-frame fusions involved receptor tyrosine kinases (Table S2C).
Collectively, these analyses recovered all known glioma driving events, including in IDH1
(n = 457), TP53 (n = 328), ATRX (n = 220), EGFR (n = 314), PTEN (n = 168), CIC (n = 80),
FUBP1 (n = 45). Notable newly predicted glioma drivers relative to the earlier TCGA
analyses were genes associated with chromatin organization such as SETD2 (n = 24), ARID2
(n = 20), DNMT3A (n = 11), and the KRAS/NRAS oncogenes (n = 25 and n = 5,
respectively).

Author Manuscript

We overlapped copy number, mutation (n = 793) and fusion transcript (n = 649) profiles and
confirmed the convergence of genetic drivers of glioma into pathways including the RasRaf-MEK-ERK, p53/apoptosis, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, chromatin modification and cell cycle
pathways. The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade showed alterations in 106 of 119
members detected across 578 cases (73%), mostly occurring in IDH-wildtype samples (n =
327 of 357, 92%). Conversely, we found that a set of 36 genes involved in chromatin
modification was targeted by genetic alterations in 423 tumors (54%, n = 36 genes), most of
which belonged to the IDH-mutant-non-codel group (n = 230, 87%).

Author Manuscript

In order to identify new somatically altered glioma genes, we used MutComFocal to
nominate candidates altered by mutation as well as copy number alteration. Prominent
among these genes was NIPBL, a crucial adherin subunit that is essential for loading
cohesins on chromatin (Table S2D)(Peters and Nishiyama, 2012). The cohesin complex is
responsible for the adhesion of sister chromatids following DNA replication and is essential
to prevent premature chromatid separation and faithful chromosome segregation during
mitosis (Peters and Nishiyama, 2012). Alterations in the cohesin pathway have been
reported in 12% of acute myeloid leukemias (Kon et al., 2013). Mutations of the cohesin
complex gene STAG2 had been previously reported in GBM (Brennan et al., 2013). Taken
together, 16% of the LGG/GBM showed mutations and/or CNAs in multiple genes involved
in the cohesin complex, thus nominating this process as a prominent pathway involved in
gliomagenesis.
Telomere length is positively correlated with ATRX but not TERT promoter mutations

Author Manuscript

Mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp) have been reported in 80% of GBM (Killela et al.,
2013). We used TERTp mutation calls from targeted sequencing (n = 287) and
complemented them with TERTp mutations inferred from whole genome sequencing (WGS)
data (n = 42). TERTp mutations are nearly mutually exclusive with mutations in ATRX
(Eckel-Passow et al., 2015), which was confirmed in our cohort. Overall, 85% of diffuse
gliomas harbored mutations of TERTp (n=157, 48%) or ATRX (n=120, 37%). TERTp
mutations activate TERT mRNA expression through the creation of a de novo ETS
transcription factor-binding site (Horn et al., 2013) and we observed significant TERT

upregulation in TERTp mutant cases (p-value < 0.0001, Figure S1A). TERT expression
measured by RNA-seq was a highly sensitive (91%) and specific (95%) surrogate for the
presence of TERTp mutation (Figure S1B). We correlated TERTp status with glioma driving
alterations and observed that nearly all IDH-wildtype cases with chromosome 7 gain and
chromosome 10 loss harbored TERTp mutations or upregulated TERT expression (n=52/53
and n = 134/147, respectively; Figure 1A). Conversely, only 45% of IDH-wildtype samples
lacking chromosome 7/chromosome 10 events showed TERTp mutations or elevated TERT
expression (n=15/33 and n = 43/82, respectively). Thus, TERTp mutations may precede the
chr 7/chr 10 alterations which have been implicated in glioma initiation (Ozawa et al.,
2014).

Author Manuscript

To correlate TERTp mutations to telomere length, we used whole genome sequencing and
low pass whole genome sequencing data to estimate telomere length in 141 pairs of matched
tumor and normal samples. As expected, we observed an inverse correlation of telomere
length with age at diagnosis in matching blood normal samples (Figure 1B) and tumor
samples (Figure S1C). Glioma samples harboring ATRX mutations showed significantly
longer telomeres compared to TERTp mutant samples (t-test p-value < 0.0001; Figure 1C).
Among TERTp mutation gliomas, there was no difference in telomere length between
samples with and without additional IDH1/IDH2 mutations, despite a difference in age.
ATRX forms a complex with DAXX and H3.3, and the genes encoding these proteins are
frequently mutated in pediatric gliomas (Sturm et al., 2012). Mutations in DAXX and
H3F3A were identified in only two samples in our WGS dataset. The ATRX-DAXX-H3.3
complex is associated with the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and our
observations confirm previously hypothesized fundamental differences between the
telomere control exerted by telomerase and ALT (Sturm et al., 2014).

As demonstrated by the identification of TERTp mutations, somatic variants affecting
regulatory regions may play a role in gliomagenesis. Using 67 matched whole-genome and
RNA-seq expression pairs, we similarly sought to identify mutations located within 2kb
upstream of transcription start sites and associated with a gene expression change. Using
strict filtering methods we identified twelve promoter regions with mutations in at least six
samples. Three of twelve regions related to a significant difference in the expression of the
associated gene expression, suggesting possible functional consequences. Other than TERT
(n=37), promoter mutations of the ubiquitin ligase TRIM28 (n=8) and the calcium channel
gamma subunit CACNG6 (n=7) correlated with respectively upregulation and
downregulation of these genes, respectively (Table S2E). TRIM28 has been reported to
mediate the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
leading to activation of mTOR signaling and hypersensitization to AMPK agonists, such as
metformin (Pineda et al., 2015).
Unsupervised clustering of gliomas identifies six methylation groups and four RNA
expression groups associated with IDH status
To segregate the DNA methylation subtypes across the pan-glioma dataset, we analyzed 932
glioma samples profiled on the HumanMethylation450 platform (516 LGG and 129 GBM)
and the HumanMethylation27 platform (287 GBM). In order to incorporate the maximum

number of samples, we merged datasets from both methylation platforms yielding a core set
of 25,978 CpG probes. To reduce computational requirements to cluster this large dataset,
we eliminated sites that were methylated (mean β-value ≥0.3) in non-tumor brain tissues and
selected 1,300 tumor specific methylated probes (1,300/25,978, 5%) to perform
unsupervised k-means consensus clustering. This identified six distinct clusters, labeled
LGm1-6 (Figure 2A; Table S1; Table S3A). Next, we sought to determine pan-glioma
expression subtypes through unsupervised clustering analysis of 667 RNA-seq profiles (513
LGG and 154 GBM) which resulted in four main clusters labeled LGr1-4 (Figure 2B; Table
S1; Table S3A). An additional 378 GBM samples with Affymetrix HT-HG-U133A profiles
(but lacking RNA-seq data) were classified into the four clusters using a k-nearest neighbor
classification procedure. IDH mutation status was the primary driver of methylome and
transcriptome clustering and separated the cohort into two macro-groups. The LGm1/LGm2/
LGm3 DNA methylation macro-group carried IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (449 of 450, 99%)
and was enriched for LGG (421/454, 93%) while LGm4/LGm5/LGm6 were IDH-wildtype
(429/430, 99%) and enriched for GBM (383/478, 80%). LGm1-3 showed genome wide
hypermethylation compared to LGm4-6 clusters (Figure S2A), documenting the association
between IDH mutation and increased DNA methylation (Noushmehr et al., 2010; Turcan et
al., 2012). Principal component analysis using 19,520 probes yielded similar results, thus
emphasizing that our probe selection method did not introduce unwanted bias (Figure S2B).
The gene expression clusters LGr1-3 harbored IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (438 of 553, 82%)
and were enriched for LGG (436/563, 77%) while the LGr4 was exclusively IDH-wildtype
(376 of 387, 97%) and enriched for GBM (399/476, 84%).

Author Manuscript

We extended our analysis using Tumor Map (Supplementary Methods) to perform
integrated co-clustering analysis of, the combined gene expression (n = 1,196) and DNA
methylation (n = 867) profiles. An interactive Tumor Map version is publicly available at
http://tumormap.ucsc.edu/?p=ynewton.gliomas-paper. Tumor Map assigns samples to a
hexagon in a grid so that nearby samples are likely to have similar genomic profiles and
allows visualizing complex relationships between heterogeneous genomic data samples and
their clinical or phenotypical associations. Thus, clusters in the map indicate groups of
samples with high similarity of integrated gene expression and DNA methylation profiles
(Figure 2C). The map confirms clustering by IDH status and additionally shows islands of
samples that share previously reported GBM cluster memberships (Noushmehr et al., 2010;
Verhaak et al., 2010). To assess clustering sensitivity to pre-processing we tried
complementary methods and obtained similar results (Figure S2C).

Author Manuscript

To identify genes whose copy number changes are associated with concordant changes in
gene expression, we combined expression and copy number profiles from 659 samples to
define a signature of 57 genes with strong functional copy number (fCN) change (Table
S3B). The fCN signature clustered gliomas into three macro-clusters, LGfc1-3, strongly
associated with IDH and 1p/19q status (Figure S2D). The fCN analysis revealed the
functional activation of a cluster of HOXA genes in the IDH-wildtype LGfc2 cluster, which
were previously associated with glioma stem cell maintenance (Kurscheid et al., 2015).
Finally, we clustered reverse phase protein array profiles, consisting of 196 antibodies on
473 samples. Two macro clusters were observed and in contrast to the transcriptome/

methylome/fCNV clustering, the primary discriminator was based on glioma grade (LGG vs
GBM) rather than IDH status (Figure S2E). Compared to the LGG-like cluster, the GBMlike cluster had elevated expression of IGFBP2, fibronectin, PAI1, HSP70, EGFR,
phosphoEGFR, phosphoAKT, Cyclin B1, Caveolin, Collagen VI, Annexin1 and ASNS,
whereas the LGG class showed increased activity of PKC (alpha, beta and delta), PTEN,
BRAF, and phosphoP70S6K.

The above results confirm IDH status as the major determinant of the molecular footprints
of diffuse glioma. To further elucidate the subtypes of diffuse glioma, we performed
unsupervised clustering within each of the two IDH-driven macroclusters. We used 1,308
tumor specific CpG probes defined among the IDH mutation cohort (n = 450) and identified
three IDH-mutant specific DNA methylation clusters (Figure S3A). Using 914 tumor
specific CpG probes in the IDH-wildtype cohort (n = 430), we uncovered three IDHwildtype specific clusters (Figure S4A). The sets of CpG probes used to cluster each of the
two IDH-driven datasets overlapped significantly with the 1,300 probes that defined the panglioma DNA methylation clustering (1162/1,300, 89% and 853/1,300, 66%, for IDH-mutant
and IDH-wildtype, respectively). The clusters identified by separating IDH-mutant and
IDH-wildtype gliomas showed strong overall concordance with pan-glioma DNA
methylation subtypes (Table S3A). Similarly, unsupervised clustering of 426 IDH-mutant
RNA-seq profiles resulted in three subtypes (Figure S3A) and analysis of the 234 IDHwildtype samples led to four mixed LGG/GBM clusters that showed enrichment for
previously identified GBM expression subtypes (Figure S4C)(Verhaak et al., 2010).
An epigenetic signature associated with activation of cell cycle genes segregates a
subgroup of IDH-mutant LGG and GBM with unfavorable clinical outcome

Author Manuscript

The three epigenetic subtypes defined by clustering IDH-mutant glioma separated samples
harboring the 1p/19q co-deletion into a single cluster and non-codel glioma into two clusters
(Figure S3A). Conversely, non-codel glioma grouped nearly exclusively into a single
expression cluster and codels were split in two separated expression clusters (Figure S3A).
A distinct subgroup of samples within the IDH-mutant-non-codel DNA methylation clusters
manifested relatively reduced DNA methylation (Figure S3B). The unsupervised clustering
of IDH-mutant glioma was unable to segregate the lower methylated non-codel subgroup as
the 1,308 probes selected for unsupervised clustering included only 19 of the 131
differentially methylated probes characteristic for this subgroup (FDR < 10−15, difference in
mean methylation beta-value > 0.27). The low-methylation subgroup consisted of both GCIMP GBM (13/25) and LGGs (12/25) and was confirmed using a non-TCGA dataset
(Figure S3C). The tumors with higher methylation in the split cluster were very similar to
those grouped in the second non-codel cluster and a supervised comparison identified only
12 probes as differentially DNA methylated (Figure 3A; Figure 3B). We concluded that
IDH-mutant glioma is composed of three coherent subgroups: 1. The Codel group,
consisting of IDH-mutant-codel LGGs; 2. The G-CIMP-low group, including IDH-mutantnon-codel glioma (LGG and GBM) manifesting relatively low genome wide DNA
methylation; and 3. The G-CIMP-high group including IDH-mutant-non-codel glioma (LGG
and GBM) with higher global levels of DNA methylation. The newly identified G-CIMPlow group of glioma was associated with significantly worse survival as compared to the G-

CIMP-high and Codel groups (Figure S3D). The clinical outcome of the tumors classified as
G-CIMP-high was as favorable as that of Codel tumors, the subgroup generally thought to
have the best prognosis among glioma patients (Figure 3C; Figure S3D). We compared the
frequencies of glioma driver gene alterations between the three types of IDH-mutant glioma
and found that 15 of 18 G-CIMP-low cases carried abnormalities in cell cycle pathway
genes such as CDK4 and CDKN2A, relative to 36/241 and 2/172 for G-CIMP-high and
Codels, respectively (Figure 3D). Supervised analysis between gene expression of G-CIMPlow and G-CIMP-high resulted in 943 differentially expressed genes. We mapped the 943
deregulated genes to 767 nearest CpG probes (max distance 1kb) and found the majority of
the CpG probes (486/767, 63%) to show a significant methylation difference (FDR<0.05,
difference in mean methylation beta-value > 0.01) between G-CIMP-low and G-CIMP-high,
suggesting a mechanistic relation between loss of methylation and increased transcript
levels.

Recent analysis of epigenetic profiles derived from colon cancers showed that transcription
factors may bind to regions of demethylated DNA (Berman et al., 2012). Therefore, we
asked whether transcription factors may be recruited to the DNA regions differentially
methylated between G-CIMP-low samples and G-CIMP-high samples from the same
methylation cluster, using 450K methylation profiles (n=39). Globally, we detected 643
differentially methylated probes between 27 G-CIMP-low and 12 G-CIMP-high samples
(absolute diff-mean difference >= 0.25, FDR <= 5%). Most of these probes (69%) were
located outside of any known CpG island but positioned within intergenic regions known as
open seas (Figure 3E). This represents a 2.5-fold open sea enrichment compared to the
expected genome-wide distribution of 450K CpG probes (Chi-Square p-value < 2.2*10−16).
We also observed a 3.4-fold depletion within CpG islands (Chi-Square p-value <
2.2*10−16).

Author Manuscript

Using this set of intergenic CpG probes, we asked whether a DNA motif signature
associated with distal regulatory elements. Such a pattern would point to candidate
transcription factors involved in tumorigenesis of the G-CIMP-low group. A de novo motif
scan and known motif scan identified a distinct motif signature –TGTT- (geometric test pvalue = 10−11, fold enrichment = 1.8), known to be associated with the OLIG2 and SOX
transcription factor families (Figure 3E)(Lodato et al., 2013). This observation was
corroborated by the higher expression levels of SOX2 as well as 17 out of 20 other known
SOX family members in G-CIMP-low compared to G-CIMP-high (fold difference > 2). The
primary function of SOX2 in the nervous system is to promote self-renewal of neural stem
cells and, within brain tumors, the glioma stem cell state (Graham et al., 2003).
Interestingly, SOX2 and OLIG2 have been described as neurodevelopmental transcription
factors being essential for GBM propagation (Suva et al., 2014). Supervised gene expression
pathway analysis of the genes activated in the G-CIMP-low group as opposed to G-CIMPhigh group revealed activation of genes involved in cell cycle and cell division consistent
with the role of SOX in promoting cell proliferation (Figure S3E). The enrichment in cell
cycle gene expression provides additional support to the notion that development of the GCIMP-low subtype is associated with activation of cell cycle progression and may be

mediated by a loss of CpG methylation and binding of SOX factors to candidate genomic
enhancer elements.

To validate the G-CIMP-low, G-CIMP-high and Codel IDH-mutant subtypes, we compiled
a validation cohort from published studies including 324 adult and pediatric gliomas
(Lambert et al., 2013; Mur et al., 2013; Sturm et al., 2012; Turcan et al., 2012). The CpG
probe methylation signatures used to classify the validation set are provided on the
publication portal accompanying this publication (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/
publications/lgggbm_2015/). Among them, 103 were identified as IDH-mutant on the basis
of their genome wide DNA methylation profile. We classified samples in the validation set
using the probes that defined the IDH-mutant specific DNA methylation cluster analysis
integrated in a supervised random forest method. The analysis recapitulated the clusters
generated from the TCGA collection (Figure S3C). In order to determine epigenetically
regulated (EReg) genes that may be characteristic of the biology of the IDH-mutant diffuse
glioma subtypes, we compared 450k methylation DNA methylation profiles and gene
expression levels between 636 IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype gliomas and 110 non-tumor
samples from eleven different tissue types (Guintivano et al., 2013). From the list of
epigenetically regulated genes we extracted 263 genes that were grouped into EReg gene
signatures which showed differential signals amongst the three IDH-mutant subtypes
(Figure 3F). These trends were confirmed in the validation set (Figure 3G).

We investigated the possibility that the G-CIMP-high group is a predecessor to the G-CIMPlow group by comparing the DNA methylation profiles from ten IDH-mutant-non-codel
LGG and GBM primary-recurrent cases with the TCGA cohort. We evaluated the DNA
methylation status of probes identified as differentially methylated (n = 90) between GCIMP-low and G-CIMP-high (FDR < 10−13, difference in mean methylation beta-value >
0.3 and < −0.4). Four out of ten IDHmut-non-codel cases showed a demethylation pattern
after disease recurrence while partial demethylation was demonstrated in the remaining six
recurrences, supporting the notion of a progression from G-CIMP-high to G-CIMP-low
phenotype (Figure 3H).
An IDH-wildtype subgroup of histologically-defined diffuse glioma is associated with
favorable survival and shares epigenomic and genomic features with pilocytic
astrocytoma

Author Manuscript

IDH-wildtype gliomas segregated into three DNA methylation clusters (Figure S4A). The
first is enriched with tumors belonging to the classical gene expression signature and was
labeled Classic-like, whereas the second group, enriched with mesenchymal subype tumors,
was labeled Mesenchymal-like (Table S1)(Verhaak et al., 2010). The third cluster contained
a larger fraction of LGG in comparison to the other IDH-wild type clusters. We observed
that the IDH-wildtype LGGs but not the IDH-wildtype GBM in this cluster displayed
markedly longer survival (log-rank p-value =3.6 × 10−5; Figure 4A) and occurred in younger
patients (mean 37.6yr vs 50.8yr, t-test p-value = 0.002). Supervised analysis of differential
methylation between LGG and GBM in the third DNA methylation cluster did not reveal
any significant probes despite significant differences in stromal content (p-value < 0.005;

markers.

Next, we sought to validate the methylation-based classification of IDH-wildtype glioma in
an independent cohort of 221 predicted IDH-wildtype glioma samples, including 61 grade I
pilocytic astrocytomas (PA). Towards this aim, we used a supervised random forest model
built with the probes that defined the IDH-wildtype clusters. Samples classified as
Mesenchymal-like showed enrichment for the Sturm et al. Mesenchymal subtype (29/88)
and gliomas predicted as Classic-like were all RTK II ‘Classic’ (22/22), per the Sturm et al.
classification (Figure 4B; Figure S4B)(Sturm et al., 2012). We observed that PA tumors
were unanimously classified as the third, LGG-enriched group (Figure S4B). Based on the
molecular similarity with PA we labeled the LGGs in the third methylation cluster of IDHwild type tumors as PA-like. The GBMs in this group were best described as LGm6-GBM,
for their original pan-glioma methylation cluster assignment and tumor grade.

Author Manuscript

Pilocytic astrocytomas are characterized by frequent alterations in the MAPK pathway, such
as FGFR1 mutations, KIAA1549-BRAF and NTRK2 fusions (Jones et al., 2013). The
frequency of mutations, fusions and amplifications in eight PA-associated genes (BRAF,
NF1, NTRK1, NTRK2, FGFR1, and FGFR2) rated from 11% (n=12/113) of Classic-like,
13% (n=21/158) of Mesenchymal-like IDH-wildtype tumors to 32% (n=7/22) of LGm6GBM and 52% (n=13/25) of PA-like LGG (Fisher Exact Test (FET) p-value < 0.0001;
Figure 4C). Conversely, only two of 25 (8%) PA-like LGG tumors showed TERT
expression, compared to five of 12 LGm6-GBM (43%), 60 of 65 Classic-like (92%) and 82
of 98 Mesenchymal-like (84%, FET p-value < 0.0001). The PA-like group was
characterized by relatively low frequency of typical GBM alterations, in genes such as
EGFR, CDKN2A/B, and PTEN and displayed euploid DNA copy number profiles (Figure
S4E). To ascertain that the histologies of the PA-like subgroup had been appropriately
classified, we conducted an independent re-review. This analysis confirmed the presence of
the histologic features of diffuse glioma (grade II or grade III) in 23 of the 26 cases in the
cluster. The remaining three cases were re-named as PA (grade I). An independent review of
the magnetic resonance diagnostic images from thirteen cases showed a similar pattern, with
the majority of tumors showing behavior consistent with grade II or grade III glioma. Taken
together, the epigenetic analysis of the IDH-wildtype group of adult glioma revealed the
existence of a novel subgroup sharing genetic and DNA methylation features with pediatric
PA, and favorable clinical outcome compared to diffuse IDH-wildtype glioma. This group
may include but extends beyond BRAF-mutated grade II oligodendroglioma that were
previously recognized as a unique clinical entity (Chi et al., 2013)

Author Manuscript

Through comparison of the methylation profiles of 636 glioma and 110 non-neoplastic
normal samples from different tissue types, we defined EReg signatures consisting of 27
genes that showed differential signals amongst IDH-wildtype subtypes in the TCGA (Figure
4D) and the validation set (Figure 4E). EReg4 comprised a group of 15 genes
hypermethylated and downregulated in particularly Classic-like. EReg5 was defined as a
group of 12 genes associated with hypomethylation in LGm6/PA-like compared to all other
LGm clusters. These ERegs aided in characterizing the biological importance of IDH-

wildtype subtypes and were subsequently used to evaluate the prognostic importance of the
IDH-wildtype clusters.
The epigenetic classification of glioma provides prognostic value independent of age and
grade

Author Manuscript

In order to assess whether the DNA methylation-based subtypes we identified carry
prognostically relevant information independent of known overall survival predictors, we
constructed a series of survival regression models. To find the optimal model for survival
prediction we studied covariates individually and in combination with other covariates. Age
at diagnosis, histology, IDH/codel subtype, TERT expression and epigenetic subtype all
contribute to survival in single-predictor analysis (log-rank p-value < 0.05, Table S4). As
expected, age was a highly significant predictor (P<0.0001, C-Index 0.78) and was included
in all subsequent multi-predictor models. We found that histology and grade are highly
correlated. Histology provided only marginal improvement to a model that includes grade
(likelihood ratio test (LRT) p-value = 0.08) and was therefore not included in further
analyses. Conversely, grade markedly impacted a histology-based predictor model (LRT pvalue = 0.0005, Table S4) and was retained in the subsequent models. In contrast to previous
reports (Eckel-Passow et al., 2015), we failed to observe a statistically significant and
independent survival association with TERT expression (LRT p-value = 0.82, Table S4) or
TERTp mutations, after accounting for age and grade (LRT p-value = 0.85, not shown).
Thus, the optimal survival prediction model includes age, grade and epigenetic subtype
(LRT p-value< 0.0001, C-Index 0.836; Table 2).

Author Manuscript

To confirm that the epigenetic subtypes provide independent prognostic information we
tested the survival model on the validation dataset. Epigenetic subtypes in these samples
were determined as described above. The distinction between LGm6-GBM and PA-like
gliomas was made on the basis of tumor grade and not by DNA methylation signature.
Using a subset of 183 samples in the validation cohort with known survival, age and grade
we found that epigenetic subtypes are significant independent predictors of survival in the
multivariate analysis (LRT p-value < 0.0001, C-Index 0.746, Table 2). This generalization
of our model supports the epigenetic subtypes as a means to improve the prognostication of
glioma.
Activation of cell cycle/proliferation and invasion/microenvironmental changes marks
progression of LGG to GBM

Author Manuscript

We observed that in spite of morphological differences between LGG and GBM, such as
high cell density and microvascular proliferation, clustering of gene expression profiles
frequently grouped LGG and GBM together within the same subtype. Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis of the genes activated in G-CIMP GBM as opposed to the IDH-mutant-non-codel
within LGr3 (Figure 2B) revealed four major groups, including cell cycle and
hyperproliferation, DNA metabolic processes, response to stress, and angiogenesis (Figure
S5A, Table S5). These biological functions are consistent with the criteria based on mitotic
index used by pathologists to discriminate lower and high-grade glioma and the significance
of activated microglia for tumor aggressiveness (Roggendorf et al., 1996). Conversely,
compared with the G-CIMP GBM, IDH-mutant-non-codel LGG in LGr3 were characterized

by enrichment of genes associated with neuro-glial functions such as ion transport and
synaptic transmission, possibly suggesting a more differentiated nature. The comparison of
co-clustered GBM and LGG in LGr3 by the PARADIGM algorithm that integrates DNA
copy number and gene expression to infer pathway activity, confirmed that GBMs express
genes associated with cell cycle, proliferation and aggressive phenotype, through activation
of a number of cell cycle, cell replication and NOTCH signaling pathways whereas LGGs
exhibit an enrichment of neuronal differentiation specific categories including synaptic
pathways (Figure S5C, Table S5).

Author Manuscript

The analysis of the genes activated in GBM versus the LGG component of LGr4, which
grouped IDH-wildtype tumors, identified an inflammation and immunologic response
signature characterized by the activation of several chemokines (CCL18, CXCL13, CXCL2,
CXCL3) and interleukins (IL8, CXCR2) enriching sets involved in inflammatory and
immune response, negative regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle and proliferation, and the
IKB/NFKB kinase cascade Map (Figure S5B, Table S5). These characteristics suggest
differences in the relative amount of microglia. We used the ESTIMATE method to estimate
the relative presence of stromal cells which revealed significantly lower (p-value 10−6)
stromal scores of LGG IDH-wildtype versus GBM IDH-wildtype (Figure S5F)(Yoshihara et
al., 2013). Resembling the functional enrichment for LGG within LGr3, functional
enrichment of LGG IDH-wildtype in comparison to GBM within LGr4 showed activation in
LGG of special glial-neuronal functions involved in ion transport, synaptic transmission and
nervous system development.

Author Manuscript

Finally, we aimed to identify transcription factors that may exert control over prominent
gene expression programs, known as master regulators. Master regulator analysis comparing
the IDH-wildtype group to the IDH-mutant group revealed transcription factors that were
upregulated in IDH-wildtype gliomas and showed an increase in expression of target genes,
including NKX2-5, FOSL1, ETV4, ETV7, RUNX1, CEBPD, NFE2L3, ELF4, RUNX3,
NR2F2, PAX8 and IRF1 (Table S5). No TFs were found to be upregulated in IDH-mutant
gliomas relative to IDH-wildtype gliomas (at a log fold change >1).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

This study represents the largest multi-platform genomic analysis performed to date of adult
diffuse glioma (WHO grades II, III and IV). A simplified graphical summary of the
identified groups and their main clinical and biological characteristics is reported in Figure
5. The clustering of all diffuse glioma classes and grades within similarly shaped
methylation-based and expression-based groups has allowed us to pinpoint specific
molecular signatures with clinical relevance. The DNA methylation classification proposed
should be considered as a basis and it is likely that future studies involving significantly
larger cohorts and more refined profiling methods will be able to further reduce intrasubtype heterogeneity. The dissection of the IDH-mutant non-codel G-CIMP LGG and
GBM into two separate subgroups (G-CIMP-low and G-CIMP-high) based on the extent of
genome-wide DNA methylation has crucial biological and clinical relevance. In particular,
the identification of the G-CIMP-low subset, characterized by activation of cell cycle genes
mediated by SOX binding at hypomethylated functional genomic elements and unfavorable

clinical outcome is an important finding that will guide more accurate segregation and
therapeutic assessment in a group of patients in which correlations of conventional grading
with outcome are modest (Olar et al., 2015; Reuss et al., 2015). The finding that G-CIMPhigh tumors can emerge as G-CIMP-low glioma at recurrence identify variations in DNA
methylation as crucial determinants for glioma progression and provides a clue to the
mechanisms driving evolution of glioma. Our results unify previous observations that linked
the cell cycle pathway to malignant progression of low grade glioma (Mazor et al., 2015).
Future updates of the TCGA glioma clinical annotation and independent validation of our
findings may be able to consider additionally important clinical confounders such as extent
of resection and performance status, to further optimize the weights of the currently known
prognostic variables and their association to the molecular subtypes we identified.

Author Manuscript

Analysis of IDH-wildtype glioma revealed the PA-like LGG subset that harbors a silent
genomic landscape, confers favorable prognosis relative to other IDH-wildtype diffuse
glioma and displays a molecular profile with high similarity to PA. Re-review by
neuropathologists and neuroradiologists confirmed that the majority were correctly
diagnosed as diffuse glioma, emphasizing the need for integration of molecular signatures
intro clinical classification (Chi et al., 2013) for this subgroup of patients that may be spared
potentially unnecessary intensive treatments.

Author Manuscript

The large number of exomes in our dataset allowed identification of novel glioma-associated
somatic alterations, including in the KRAS and NRAS genes which were frequently used to
genetically engineered glioma mouse models (Holland et al., 2000). Our analysis further
nominates glial tumors to join an increasing number of tumor types characterized by a
deactivated cohesin pathway (Kon et al., 2013; Solomon et al., 2011). Cohesin mutant
tumors may infer increased sensitivity to DNA damage agents and PARP inhibitors (Bailey
et al., 2014) suggesting that gliomas with genetic alterations of key cohesin regulatory
factors may represent biomarkers and therapeutic opportunities.
Overexpression of TERT mRNA was found to be associated with increased telomere length
in urothelial cancer (Borah et al., 2015). Our results revealed that in gliomas, increased
telomere length is associated with ATRX mutations, suggesting an ALT mechanism. ALT
has been associated with sensitivity to inhibition of the protein kinase ATR (Flynn et al.,
2015).

Author Manuscript

In summary, our pan-glioma analysis has expanded our knowledge of the glioma somatic
alteration landscape, emphasized the relevance of DNA methylation profiles as a modality
for clinical classification, and quantitatively linked somatic TERT pathway alterations to
telomere maintenance. Combined, these findings are an important step forward in our
understanding of glioma as discrete disease subsets, and the mechanisms driving
gliomagenesis.

Figure 5. Overview of major subtypes of adult diffuse glioma

Integrative analysis of 1,122 adult glioma resulted in seven different subtypes with distinct
biological and clinical characteristics. The groups extend across six DNA methylation
subtypes of which the LGm6 cluster was further separated by tumor grade, into PA-like and
LGm6-GBM. The size of the circles is proportional to the percentages of samples within
each group. DNA methylation plot is a cartoon representation of overall genome-wide
epigenetic pattern within glioma subtypes. Survival information is represented as a set of
Kaplan-Meier curves, counts of grade, histology and LGG/GBM subtypes within the groups

Epigenetics subtypes are prognostically relevant in multivariable analysis and in external validation data. Survival regression analysis indicates that an
optimal model of prognosis includes age, grade and methylation subtype. These predictors are statistically significant in both our discovery dataset and an
external validation dataset.
