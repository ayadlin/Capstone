Abstract
Questions exist concerning the effects of acute versus chronic hypoxic conditions on DNA replication and
genomic stability that may influence tumorigenesis. Severe hypoxia causes replication arrest independent of
S-phase checkpoint, DNA damage response, or transformation status. Arrests occur during both the initiation
and elongation phases of DNA replication, correlated with a rapid decrease in available deoxynucleotide triphosphates. With fluctuating oxygen tensions in tumors, arrested hypoxic cells may undergo rapid reperfusion
and reoxygenation that leads to reoxygenation-induced DNA damage. In cells subjected to chronic hypoxia, we
found that replicative restart was inhibited along with numerous replication factors, including MCM6 and
RPA, the latter of which limits the hypoxia-induced DNA damage response. In contrast, in cells where replicative restart occurred, it was accompanied by extensive reoxygenation-induced DNA damage and compromised DNA repair. We found that cells reoxygenated after acute hypoxia underwent rapid p53-dependent
apoptosis. Our findings suggest that cells lacking functional p53 are more susceptible to genomic instability
and potentially tumorigenesis if they experience reoxygenation after acute exposure to hypoxia. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Regions of hypoxia occur in all solid tumors as a result
of an abnormally formed tumor vasculature and inadequate perfusion of the tumor mass. The occurrence of regions of low oxygen is an indicator of poor patient
prognosis due to increased chemo- and radio-resistance,
genomic instability, and metastatic potential (1, 2). The occurrence of episodes of reoxygenation following hypoxic
exposures of various degrees is inherent to the dynamic
nature of the tumor vasculature (3, 4). The range of oxygen tensions within a tumor varies between approximately
8% and 0.02% (near anoxia, 100–150 μm from blood vessels; ref. 5). Previous reports showed that severe hypoxia
(pO2 <0.02%) induces an S-phase arrest due to inhibition
of DNA synthesis in a HIF-1–independent manner (6, 7).
Hypoxia-induced replication stress was shown to induce
activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) apical

kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATMrelated (ATR) and phosphorylation of downstream targets
such as p53, Chk1, and Chk2, albeit in the absence of detectable DNA damage (6, 8, 9). In contrast, reoxygenation
was shown to rapidly induce DNA damage and, consequently, a more conventional Chk2-dependent DDR leading
to a G2-M arrest (10, 11). Replicative stress and the subsequent induction of the DDR occur early in tumorigenesis
and have been proposed to act as a barrier to tumor progression (12, 13). It has been suggested that hypoxia could
contribute to this because hypoxic regions can form in
preneoplastic lesions (13, 14).
In this study, we have characterized the hypoxia-induced
S-phase arrest, showing that, at the molecular level, it is
associated with an inhibition of DNA replication in both
the initiation and elongation phases. Chronic hypoxia exposure actively induces disassembly of the replisome, preventing replication restart after reoxygenation. However, acutely
exposed cells are still able to restart replication despite the
presence of an active checkpoint response and reoxygenation-induced DNA damage. In a tumor, whereas regions of
chronic hypoxia cells eventually die and undergo necrosis,
replication restart in regions acutely subjected to low oxygen
could potentially lead to an accumulation of unrepaired
lesions and increased genomic instability (15). This is further
aggravated by hypoxia-dependent decreased DNA repair
(16). Our findings highlight the critical role of hypoxia in
tumor progression and indicate that under chronic conditions, hypoxia can limit tumor progression, whereas under
acute conditions, cycles of hypoxia-reoxygenation increase
genomic instability.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. RKO, HCT116, and U2OS cells were grown in
DMEM with 10% FCS; IBR3 and IBR3 hTert were grown in
DMEM with 15% FCS. RKO-neo and RKO-E7 lines were a
gift from Dr. Kathleen Cho (University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, MI). HCT116 spheroids were grown for 15 d by adding single-cell suspensions obtained from exponential cultures to spinning flasks (4 × 106 total cells). Pimonidazole
(1 μmol/L) was added 24 h before fixation. All cell lines
were Mycoplasma-free.
Hypoxia treatment. Hypoxia treatments were carried out
in a Bactron II anaerobic chamber (Shell Labs) or an In vivo
400 (Ruskinn). Cells were plated on glass dishes. Acute hypoxia was considered up to 12 h whereas chronic exposure
was 16 to 48 h. Where no period of reoxygenation is indicated, cells were harvested inside the chamber with equilibrated solutions.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cells
were labeled with 10 μmol/L bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
(Sigma) 1 h before harvesting. Cells were processed for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis on a FACSort
flow cytometer (BD) after staining with mouse anti-BrdUrd
antibody (BD Biosciences) and Alexa-fluor 488–conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Quantification of cell
populations was done using WinMDI 2.9 software (Scripps
Research Institute).
siRNA transfection. p53 Silencer Select Validated siRNA
(Applied Biosystems Ambion) or Stealth RNAi negative control
(Invitrogen) duplexes, at a final concentration of 50 nmol/L,
were transfected into RKO cells using DhamaFECT (Thermo
Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5′-3′
oligo sequence: GUAAUCUACUGGGACGGAAtt.
DNA fiber analysis. The DNA fiber technique was done as
described recently (17), with some specific modifications (see
Supplementary Fig. S2). Fiber spreads were examined using a
Radiance confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Red (CldU) and
green (IdU) tracks were measured, and replication structures
quantified using ImageJ software (NIH). At least 100 replication tracks were measured and 200 replication structures
counted per condition per experiment.
Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in UTB [9 mol/L urea,
75 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.15 mol/L β-mercaptoethanol] and sonicated briefly. Preparation of chromatin-bound
protein extracts was done as described (18). Primary antibodies
were anti-MCM6, anti-MCM7, anti-Chk1, anti-Rad51, anti-p53,
and anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-RPA32 and antiMCM5 (Dr. C. Bauerschmidt, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK);
anti–proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Calbiochem);
anti–HIF-1α (BD Biosciences); anti–pATM S1981 (Epitomics);
anti–pChk1 S317 (Cell Signaling Technology); and anti-TopBP1
(Abcam). Secondary antibodies were Alexa-fluor 680–conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Detection
was done using the Odyssey IR imaging technology (LI-COR
Biosciences).
Immunofluorescence. RPA and 53BP1 staining was as
described (8). ssDNA and BrdUrd staining was carried
out as previously described (19). Cells were visualized using

926

Cancer Res; 70(3) February 1, 2010

a Nikon 90i microscope or a Radiance confocal microscope
(Bio-Rad).
Immunohistochemistry. Staining was done as described,
with some modifications (20); antigen retrieval was done using EDTA (pH 8.0) for Hydroxyprobe and EDTA (pH 9.0) for
CAIX and MCM6. Primary antibodies used were Hydroxyprobe (Chemicon), anti-CAIX (M75; a gift from Dr. Pastorekova, Institute of Virology, Slovak Academy of Sciences,
Bratislava, Slovak Republic), and anti-MCM6 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).
Nucleotide quantification. The extracts for quantification
of nucleotide levels were carried in hypoxia with 3% tricarboxylic acid as described (21).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) was done as previously described (22),
using the Express SYBR GreenER qRT-PCR Supermix Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations.
Reactions were carried out in a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Expression levels were
normalized to 18S rRNA and vascular endothelial growth factor was used as a positive control.
Reporter assay. Cells were transfected with the reporter
constructs (80 ng/well) using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen), along with pCMV-Renilla (0.2 ng/well) for
normalization. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were
measured using the Dual Glo Luciferase assay (Promega).
Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of differences between data sets was determined assessed by using
Student's t test. Statistical significance was assumed if
P < 0.05 or lower and is noted in the figures. Error bars
represent ±SE.

Results
DNA fiber analysis shows a block in replication
initiation and elongation in response to severe hypoxia.
Exposure to low oxygen levels results in a rapid cessation
of DNA synthesis in the absence of DNA damage (7). Oxygen
levels must be below 0.1% to induce an arrest, shown by
BrdUrd incorporation, and all subsequent experiments
were carried out at 0% to 0.02% O2 unless otherwise stated
(Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1). The oxygen dependency of
the arrest confirmed previous findings indicating that the Sphase arrest is independent of HIF-1 (7). The rapid cessation
of DNA synthesis observed in response to severe levels of
hypoxia, described here and previously, used techniques such
as [3H]thymidine labeling or BrdUrd incorporation followed
by FACS analysis (7, 10, 23). These methods allow the overall
levels of DNA synthesis to be determined in a hypoxic cell
but do not give any information about the stage of replication at which the block occurs. To fully investigate hypoxiainduced replication arrest, we have made use of the DNA
fiber technique, which allows visualization of individual
DNA strands and of different replication structures, as well
as measurement of the speed of ongoing replication forks
(Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 24). RKO cells were exposed to
hypoxia for 4, 6, or 8 hours, and the replication structures observed, quantified, and characterized as stalled forks, ongoing

Reoxygenation-Induced Replication Restart

forks, or new origins (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that a stalled
fork could also be a first-label termination, as these two structures are indistinguishable using this technique. After 4 hours
of hypoxia, the number of stalled/terminated forks increased
significantly and continued to accumulate over the following
4 hours. Concomitant with the increase in stalled forks, we
saw a decrease in ongoing forks. Importantly, we determined
that origin firing was significantly repressed in hypoxic conditions, being nonexistent at the 8-hour time point.
We examined the rate of replication at ongoing fork
speeds, measuring both the average and median rates
(Fig. 1C). After 4 hours of hypoxia, the number of ongoing
forks had decreased by approximately 75% and the average

and median rates of the remaining were decreased significantly when compared with normoxic samples, with a shift
of the distribution severely toward the left. The fork speeds
were reduced further at 6 and 8 hours of hypoxic exposure,
being more than 15-fold reduced at the later time point when
compared with normoxic forks (0.05 versus 0.83 kb/min median rates; Fig. 1C and data not shown). Many of the hypoxic
ongoing forks have a barely detectable level of second label,
leading us to consider that they are not truly representative
of ongoing forks and that replication may be completely abrogated in these conditions. These data show that DNA replication is blocked at both the initiation and elongation
phases in response to hypoxia.

Figure 2. Chronic exposures to hypoxia impair replication restart after reoxygenation. Hypoxia levels pO2 <0.02. A, RKO cells were pulse labeled with
BrdUrd for 1 h in normoxic conditions and then harvested or exposed to hypoxia (16 h) or reoxygenation (16 h). BrdUrd-negative populations are
represented in red, and BrdUrd-positive populations in green. Percentages of different cellular populations were calculated (clockwise from top left: BrdUrd

Scale bars are indicated. Note that viii and ix are higher magnifications of the area shown in vi and vii, respectively.

The ability of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) to synthesize
the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTP) required for
DNA replication is dependent on a tyrosyl free radical within
the enzymes active site. This free radical is generated in an
oxygen-dependent manner and is therefore compromised under hypoxic conditions (7, 23, 25). The ability of RNR to synthesize the four dNTPs required for DNA replication is
dependent on a tyrosyl free radical within the enzymes active
site. This free radical is generated in an oxygen-dependent
manner and is therefore compromised under hypoxic conditions (25). Nucleotide levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with spectrophotometric
detection in HCT116 cells exposed to hypoxia or to hydroxyurea as a control (Fig. 1D). Levels of dNTPs decreased
significantly (within 1 hour) in response to hypoxia, suggesting that a loss of RNR activity under hypoxic conditions
could be the underlying cause or contribute to the hypoxiainduced arrest. Significantly, dNTP levels did not decrease
during exposure to milder hypoxia (2% O2), which does
not induce replication arrest (data not shown). The absolute

928

Cancer Res; 70(3) February 1, 2010

levels of RNR protein were not found to change throughout
the experiment (data not shown). We also noted that energy
charge was not altered during the first 24 hours of hypoxic
treatment, indicating that decreased energy levels did not
contribute to the arrest (Supplementary Fig. S3). This suggests a model whereby stalled forks arise during exposure
to hypoxia as a result of reduced levels of dNTPs and trigger
signaling pathways that inhibit origin firing, which is also reinforced by a lack of available nucleotides.
Replication restart is inhibited in response to chronic
hypoxia. The fate of hypoxia-arrested cells after reoxygenation is significant because reoxygenation induces significant
levels of damage and major DNA repair pathways including
homologous recombination are inhibited during hypoxia/reoxygenation (9, 16, 26). To investigate replication restart in
this scenario, we pulse labeled RKO cells with BrdUrd to follow S-phase cells through hypoxia and reoxygenation; cells
were scored as being unlabeled or labeled in the G1, S, or
G2 phase (Fig. 2A). Labeled S-phase cells exposed to hypoxia
(16 hours) failed to progress into G2 after reoxygenation,

Reoxygenation-Induced Replication Restart

suggesting that they were replication incompetent. Unlabeled
G1 cells were able to progress through to S phase after reoxygenation, suggesting that the hypoxia-induced G1 arrest is
not permanent and that the cells were viable (27). These
data indicate that chronic (16-hour) hypoxia exposure compromises the ability of the S-phase arrested cells to restart
DNA replication.
Previous microarray analysis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts suggested that a number of genes involved in DNA replication or repair were repressed in hypoxic conditions,
including Asf1b, MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, MCM6, MCM7,
Rad51 AP1, and Fen1 (22). In addition, polysomes were fractionated after 24 or 48 hours of hypoxia followed by qRT-PCR
to identify gene products actively repressed in hypoxic conditions (data not shown). Of the previously identified genes,

MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, and Asf1b were found to be repressed.
We have verified by qRT-PCR the repression of components
of the replication machinery under hypoxic conditions in a human cell line (Fig. 2B). Before proceeding further, we determined if hypoxia downregulation of key replication factors
occurred both at the protein level and in vivo. The MCM complex (MCM2–MCM7) is loaded onto the chromatin in the G1
cell cycle phase to form the pre-replicative complexes, and
their helicase function is activated on initiation and required
for duplex unwinding during ongoing replication (28, 29).
First, the HCT116 cell line was grown as spheroids before
staining for MCM6 and the hypoxia marker pimonidazole
(Fig. 2C, i–v). The outer layers of the spheroids show a strong
nuclear stain of MCM6, whereas the cells surrounding the necrotic core show no or greatly reduced levels of MCM6. As expected, the pattern of pimonidazole staining is inverse to that
seen for MCM6, that is, more positive toward the necrotic
core, indicating increasing levels of hypoxia. U87 cells were
grown as xenograft tumors and treated with the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab (30). The tumors were sectioned
and stained for CAIX and MCM6 (Fig. 2C, vi–ix). As expected,
viable cells within CAIX-positive regions showed decreased
levels of MCM6. In both models, we noticed that MCM6 levels
decrease before cells become obviously necrotic, supporting
our hypothesis that this is an active mechanism induced in
response to hypoxia and not a result of cell death. It should
be noted than in both systems, additional microenvironmental stresses not present in in vitro experiments may also play
a role in the repression of MCM6, for example, nutrient deprivation (glucose and amino acids) and acidosis.
The E2F transcription factors have been shown to be important for the cell growth–regulated expression of the MCM proteins as well as for the repression of DNA repair during hypoxia
(31, 32). We investigated whether the hypoxia-induced repression of MCM proteins is E2F dependent, first, by using the
overexpression of human papillomavirus (HPV) E7. HPV E7
disrupts the E2F/pocket protein interaction and also targets
pocket proteins for degradation, thus interfering with E2F activity (31). The expression levels of MCM3 to MCM7 were compared in two RKO cell lines overexpressing E7 with a matched
control (Fig. 3A). In each case, the hypoxia-induced repression
was significantly alleviated by the presence of E7. To validate
the involvement of the E2Fs, we made use of a MCM6 reporter
construct with all the identified E2F binding sites mutated
(32). In response to hypoxia, we observed a 10- to 20-fold repression of the MCM6 promoter in contrast to a 5× HRE luciferase construct, which was induced 40-fold (Fig. 3B). Loss of
E2F binding significantly altered the repression of MCM6 in
response to hypoxia.
Our next step was to examine what effect the repression of
the MCM mRNAs had on the protein levels of MCM5, MCM6,
and MCM7 (Fig. 3C). In each case, the protein levels decreased and most significantly so after more chronic hypoxia
exposures, and it should be noted that this was not due to a
loss of S-phase cells (Fig. 2A). Because the protein levels
for the MCMs were not completely abrogated, potentially
due to the long half-life of these proteins (24 hours; ref.
33), we investigated whether the remaining MCM proteins

hypoxia showed no association of MCM5, MCM6, or MCM7
with the chromatin, indicating a complete lack of replisome
function (Fig. 3C). The GINS proteins have been shown to in-

(34). We investigated one of the GINS proteins, Psf2, and found
that total levels of Psf2 decreased rapidly in hypoxia. We have
also shown that, as predicted by the polysome assay, levels of
polymerase δ are repressed in hypoxic conditions and show

Reoxygenation-Induced Replication Restart

decreased chromatin association. This was not a general effect because PCNA remained chromatin bound during both
acute and chronic hypoxia. Taken together, these data indicate that replication does not resume after chronic periods
of hypoxia due to an active disassembly of the replisome including both the helicases and polymerases. The mechanism
behind this seems to be multifactorial. These data are supportive of a transcriptional model in which activating E2Fs
are replaced on the MCM6 promoter with repressive E2Fs,
possibly E2F4 because it is the most sensitive to E7 expression
during hypoxia exposure (35). In addition, the MCM complex
is not retained at the replication fork potentially due to a loss
of interacting factors such as Psf2. The MCM complex has
been shown to be phosphorylated by ATM and ATR in re-

sponse to replication stress (MCM2 and MCM3), whereas
MCM7 has been shown to interact with ATR-interacting protein (36). Both the ATM and ATR kinases have been shown to
be active during hypoxia, and it is therefore plausible that
they contribute to MCM/replisome stability.
The accumulation of stalled replication forks or replicative
stress has been shown to activate the DDR. Acute hypoxia
exposure induced both ATM-S1981 and Chk1-S317, indicating the activity of both the ATM and ATR kinases. However,
these signals were lost or decreased with increasing hypoxia
exposure time (Fig. 4A). An integral step in the DDR to replication stress is the recognition of regions of ssDNA at
stalled forks and binding of RPA. The levels of RPA did
not change during hypoxia although there was a robust

that was absent after longer times (Fig. 4B; Supplementary
Fig. S4A and B). RPA was found to be chromatin associated
during acute, but not chronic, hypoxia. In support of this, we
found that RPA formed clear nuclear foci in response to hypoxia but that these decreased as exposure time increased
(Fig. 4C). We then verified that the hypoxia-induced RPA foci
were indeed regions of ssDNA by costaining for BrdUrd in
labeled but nondenatured cells. The RPA foci and regions
of ssDNA completely colocalized (Fig. 4D). This prompted
us to count the number of cells positive for ssDNA by BrdUrd
staining. We found that this signal also decreases with
increasing exposure time, indicating that the signal which

932

Cancer Res; 70(3) February 1, 2010

initiates the DDR in response to hypoxia decreases after
extended periods, potentially due to slow or residual polymerase activity (37). These data are supportive of the hypoxia-induced DDR stabilizing the replisome during acute
exposure, potentially through phosphorylation of the MCM
complex, although we have not been able to verify this.
Cells exposed to acute hypoxia/reoxygenation remain
replication competent. In response to chronic exposure to
hypoxia, essential components of both the replication machinery and the DDR are repressed, which together lead
to the destabilization of the replication fork and prevent subsequent restart. However, closer examination of our data
indicates that this may not be the case during shorter/acute

exposures (less than 12 hours). This raises the possibility that
cells that have undergone hypoxia-induced replication arrest
for shorter time periods might be capable of replication restart. To address this, we repeated the BrdUrd chase experiment and found that labeled S-phase cells indeed progressed
through the cell cycle to G2 (Fig. 5A). To investigate this further, we have again made use of the DNA fiber technique.
After acute exposure to hypoxia (6 hours), followed by reoxygenation, there was a significant increase in the number
of ongoing forks, an increase in the number of new origins,
and, as expected, a decrease in the number of stalled forks
(Fig. 5B). Using the mitotic shake-off technique, we have
ruled out any contribution of hypoxic G1 cells entering S
phase during reoxygenation in the fiber analysis (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Our data suggest that hypoxia-induced replication arrest is dependent on a decrease in dNTPs (Fig. 1D);
here, we investigated the dNTP levels after reoxygenation. As
previously, we saw a rapid and significant drop in all four
nucleotides in response to hypoxia; however, these levels returned to normal within 2 hours of reoxygenation (Fig. 5C).
The same trend was also seen in HCT116 cells (data not
shown). Interestingly, we found that this correlated with reoxygenation-restarted replicating fork rates, which were
slower than those under normoxic conditions but returned
to normal within 2 hours after reoxygenation (Fig. 5C).
Despite reoxygenation-induced damage and activation of
the ATM/ATR signaling pathways, DNA replication resumes
during reoxygenation after acute hypoxia.
In addition to its role in regulating initiation and elongation in unperturbed cells, Chk1 has been shown to regulate
these processes following replication stress such as UV,
camptothecin, and hydroxyurea (18, 38–40). However, the
role of Chk1 in hypoxia-mediated arrest and reoxygenation-induced restart is unknown. Pharmacologic inhibition
of Chk1 by treatment with Gö6976 did not significantly
change the number of ongoing forks, suggesting that Chk1
did not affect the hypoxia-induced arrest (Fig. 6A). Chk1 inhibition led to an overall decrease in average and median
speed even in the absence of hypoxic stress, which was
not further exacerbated by hypoxia exposure (data not
shown). During replication restart after acute hypoxia, however, loss of Chk1 led to a significant increase in the number
of new origins firing. This is supported by previous data indicating a role for Chk1 in mediating the S-phase checkpoint
(41, 42). Again, this was verified using the mitotic shake-off
technique (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
We have considered that replication restart might be restricted to tumor cell lines or possibly cells deficient in mismatch repair as used here and have therefore investigated this
after reoxygenation in a nontransformed cell line (43). Primary 1BR3 and immortalized 1BR3 hTert cell lines were exposed
to hypoxia and reoxygenation (Fig. 6B). In both cases, cells
arrested in response to hypoxia as determined by a significant
increase in the number of stalled/terminated forks. In both
cases, Chk1 was also phosphorylated during hypoxia exposure
(data not shown). Reoxygenation-induced replication restart
was measured in both cell lines and seemed to be slightly
more robust in the 1BR3 compared with the 1BR3 hTert line.

These data show that replication restart is not restricted to
transformed cell lines after reoxygenation but is a more
widespread phenomenon.
These findings led us to hypothesize that, to prevent reoxygenated cells undergoing replication restart from contributing to genomic instability, cell death might be induced. RKO
cells were treated with siRNA to p53 or a nontargeting control followed by 6 hours of hypoxia and reoxygenation, and
the levels of apoptosis were then determined (Fig. 6C). The
p53 status did not affect the level of hypoxia-induced apoptosis, which was approximately 5%. However, after reoxygenation, there was a significant increase in apoptosis, which was
p53 dependent. These data indicate that p53-proficient cells
that undergo replication restart should be eradicated from
the tumor population by apoptosis, whereas those that have
p53-pathway mutations escape and contribute to genomic
instability.

Discussion
We have conclusively shown that replication is abrogated
in hypoxic conditions during both the initiation and elongation phases and that this correlates with decreasing dNTP
levels potentially resulting from decreased RNR activity. Until
now, it has been unclear whether cells exposed to hypoxiainduced replication arrest are capable of completing S phase
after a reoxygenation event. Our data show that this is critically dependent on the exposure time to hypoxia.
Even when still viable, chronically arrested cells are incapable of replication restart in response to reoxygenation and
therefore do not contribute to continued tumorigenesis. We
have attributed this to a complete loss of replisome stability
as well as hypoxia-mediated downregulation of the homologous recombination pathway. In contrast, our data show that
after shorter periods of hypoxia-induced replication arrest,
cells are able to resume replication in response to reoxygenation. Importantly, this occurs in the presence of reactive oxygen species–induced DNA damage and when essential DNA
repair pathways are somewhat inhibited, including nonhomologous end joining, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination (16, 26). A number of genes essential to these
repair pathways have been identified that are specifically repressed during hypoxia, including Rad51, Rad52, BRCA1,
BRCA2, Ku70, DNA-PKcs, LigIV, MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6
(44–48). Together, these data indicate that cells that resume
DNA synthesis after a reoxygenating event do so in the presence of DNA damage and with impaired DNA repair capabilities. Our data show that if these restarted cells retain p53
activity, they undergo apoptosis. However, because the majority of tumor cells harbor p53 or p53-pathway mutations,
it is more likely that cycling through periods of acute hypoxia
followed by reoxygenation will lead to an accumulation of
unrepaired lesions and increased genomic instability (15).
Encouragingly, our findings indicate that therapeutic options, such as bevacizumab, may enhance the potential effects of DNA repair/replication inhibitors and therefore
suggest that a combined approach may be an effective way
to target hypoxic regions. In addition, these findings suggest
