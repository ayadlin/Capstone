Abstract
Preventing breast cancer will require the development of
targeted strategies that can effectively block disease progression.
Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors are effective in addressing
estrogen receptor–positive (ERþ) breast cancer development,
but estrogen receptor–negative (ER) breast cancer remains an
unmet challenge due to gaps in pathobiologic understanding.
In this study, we used reverse-phase protein array to identify
activation of Src kinase as an early signaling alteration in
premalignant breast lesions of women who did not respond
to tamoxifen, a widely used ER antagonist for hormonal therapy of breast cancer. Src kinase blockade with the small-molecule inhibitor saracatinib prevented the disorganized three-

dimensional growth of ER mammary epithelial cells in vitro
and delayed the development of premalignant lesions and
tumors in vivo in mouse models developing HER2þ and ER
mammary tumors, extending tumor-free and overall survival.
Mechanistic investigations revealed that Src blockade reduced
glucose metabolism as a result of an inhibition in ERK1/2–
MNK1–eIF4E–mediated cap-dependent translation of c-Myc
and transcription of the glucose transporter GLUT1, thereby
limiting energy available for cell growth. Taken together, our
results provide a sound rationale to target Src pathways in
premalignant breast lesions to limit the development of breast
cancers. Cancer Res; 75(22); 4863–75. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

cancer subtypes account for approximately 10% to 15% and 15%
to 20% of total breast cancers, respectively (5, 6). Here, we
explored strategies to prevent ER breast cancer in an HER2þ/ER
mammary tumor model.
One of the molecular mechanisms of ER loss in ER breast
cancer is constitutive proteolysis of ERa via Src activation (7).
Moreover, Src promotes ER phosphorylation, leading to increased
proliferation and tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells (8, 9).
ER breast cancer cells have been found to be more dependent on
Src activation than ERþ breast cancer cells and noncancerous
breast cells, as Src silencing increased ER breast cancer cell death
(10). In TamR breast cancer cells, Src activity is upregulated and
associated with a more aggressive phenotype (11). These ﬁndings
indicate that Src activation is a key signaling event driving ER and
TamR breast cancer progression and suggest that targeting Src may
prevent ER breast cancer.
Src targeting agents, such as the small-molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitors dasatinib, bosutinib, and saracatinib, have been extensively tested in the clinic for treatment of metastatic breast cancer
(12); however, they have never been explored for cancer prevention purposes. Given the beneﬁts associated with targeted cancer
therapies, for example, better tolerance and lower cost of smallmolecule inhibitors relative to chemotherapy (13), we postulated
that low-dose Src targeting agents may be an effective and welltolerated option for prevention of ER breast cancer. Dasatinib
and bosutinib are active against a broad spectrum of kinases,
whereas saracatinib is a potent and more selective Src inhibitor
(13), making it a good candidate for proof-of-concept prevention
studies. In addition, saracatinib used in combination with fulvestrant (ER antagonist), circumvented antiestrogen resistance in
ERþ breast and ovarian cancer preclinical models (14, 15). Given

Despite recent advances in effective treatment, including targeted therapies, many women still die of breast cancer (1).
Ultimately, the most effective way to reduce breast cancer mortality is disease prevention (2). In large-scale prevention trials,
tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors reduced the incidence of
estrogen receptor–positive (ERþ) breast cancer in high-risk women by approximately 50% (3, 4). However, prevention of estrogen
receptor–negative (ER) and tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) breast
cancer remains an overarching unmet demand. ER breast cancers
account for approximately 30% of total breast cancers (5), of
which EGFR2-positive (HER2þ)/ER and triple-negative breast

Prevention of ER Breast Cancer by Targeting Src

the lack of low-toxicity targeted agents for ER breast cancer
prevention (16), saracatinib at lower doses may possess unrecognized potential for breast cancer prevention.
Metabolic dysregulations have been associated with increased
breast cancer risk (17). Premalignant and neoplastic cells exhibit
increased demand for energy and nutrients to proliferate and
survive (18, 19). Increased glucose uptake enables the generation
of building blocks for dysregulated cellular growth, which facilitates cancer initiation (18). In tumor cells, c-Myc (Myc) plays an
important role in regulating glycolysis and glutaminolysis (20).
Endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells overexpress Myc, which
correlates with increased dependency on glucose and glutamine,
and these cells could survive on glutamine upon glucose deprivation (21). Notably, ER primary breast tumors had an increased
uptake of 18F-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (a glucose analogue) and
express higher levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) than
ERþ tumors (22, 23). However, the role of glucose metabolic
dysregulation in the early stages of cancer is unclear, and the
role of Src in regulating glucose metabolism in cancer cells is not
well studied.
In this study, we set out to tackle the challenges of preventing
HER2þ and ER breast cancer. We found that Src activation was a
key signaling alteration during early-stage cancer initiation and
that Src inhibition suppressed cap-dependent translation of Myc
and reduced GLUT1 transcription and glucose uptake in premalignant ER mammary epithelial cells (MEC), consequently inhibiting cell proliferation and ER mammary tumor initiation and
development. These preclinical ﬁndings provide a strong scientiﬁc
foundation of using Src inhibitors for preventing, at least this
subtype, of ER breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Patient samples
Patient sample collection was carried out in accordance with
institutional review board-approved protocol at the Duke University Medical Center (Durham, NC). "High-risk patients"
include women with greater than 20% lifetime risk of developing
breast cancer, as assessed by at least one of the criteria: (i) prior
biopsy containing atypia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or
lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), (ii) known or suspected to have
BRCA mutations, or (iii) ﬁrst-degree family member with premenopausal breast cancer. No BRCA mutation carriers were
included in this study. The presence of atypia in random periareolar ﬁne-needle aspiration (RPFNA) has been used as a surrogate
marker to track cytologic response to chemoprevention agents.
Informed consent was obtained before enrolling women in the
study. In the following analysis, ER status was not determined in
any of the materials collected from patients.
Cells and vectors
The ER mammary epithelial cells, MCF10A and MCF12A,
were obtained from ATCC. The pLKO.1-based shRNAs for Src

were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and the Src-mutant (Y527F)
construct from Addgene. shRNAs for GLUT1 were obtained from
MD Anderson Cancer Center's shRNA core facility (Houston, TX).
Amplex Red glucose assay kit
The Amplex Red Glucose Assay Kit was used (Life Technologies) following previously published protocol (24). Brieﬂy, 1.3 
104 cells were plated in poly-HEMA–coated 96 wells. After
24 hours, media were collected and diluted 1:4,000 in water.
The amount of glucose in the media was then determined using
the Amplex Red Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glucose uptake was analyzed by subtracting the amount of
glucose in each sample from the total amount of glucose in the
media (without cells). The data represent experiments from three
independent replicates. To examine the effect of saracatinib on
glucose uptake, cells pretreated with either vehicle or saracatinib
for 3 days were seeded to perform the assay.
ER mammary tumor prevention studies
Mouse experiments were performed in accordance with
approved protocols from the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of MD Anderson Cancer Center. Female MMTV-neu
mice were treated with either vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose with Tween-80) or saracatinib by oral gavage once
daily for 6 days a week. Tumor sizes were measured twice a week.
Tumor-free survival was deﬁned as the time from date of birth to
the ﬁrst appearance of a palpable mammary tumor at least 100
mm3 in size. The fourth pair of normal looking mammary fat pads
(MFP) was isolated from these mice at 32 weeks of age. For
histologic analyses, nonserial sections thoughtout the MFPs were
analyzed. Another cohort was set up using female MMTV-neu
mice. These mice were treated either with vehicle or saracatinib.
Tumor-free and overall survivals were monitored.
Statistical analyses
Quantitative results were analyzed either by one-way ANOVA
(multiple groups) or t test (two groups). Differences with P < 0.05
(two-sided) were considered statistically signiﬁcant.  , P < 0.05;  ,
P < 0.01; and  , P < 0.001. For patient samples, Wilcoxon ranksum test was used. Tumor-free and overall survival analyses were
performed using the Kaplan–Meier Wilcoxon test. Bars represent
means  SEM.

Elevated Src expression in premalignant breast lesions of
women who did not respond to tamoxifen
To develop effective prevention strategy for ER antagonist–
unresponsive breast cancer, we sought to identify targetable
molecular signature in premalignant lesions of women who did
not respond to tamoxifen and were at a higher risk of developing
tamoxifen-unresponsive breast cancer. Eighteen high-risk women

with greater than 20% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer
were given tamoxifen (20 mg, orally once daily) for cancer
prevention. After 6 to 12 months of treatment, women who
experienced a disappearance of atypia or did not progress to
develop atypical lesions were classiﬁed as tamoxifen-sensitive
(Tam-S, n ¼ 12) and those who had persistent atypical lesions
or developed atypical lesions were classiﬁed as tamoxifen nonresponder (Tam-NR; n ¼ 6). Next, reverse-phase protein array
(RPPA) was performed in duplicate from a total of 22 Tam-S and
Tam-NR RPFNA samples (8 bilaterally and 14 unilaterally). Six of
the biomarkers (c-Src, E-cadherin, phospho-Bad-S136, phosphoBcl2-S70, phospho-IkB-S32/36, and phospho-P70S6K-T412)
were signiﬁcantly increased in Tam-NR compared with Tam-S
samples (Fig. 1A). Among these, c-Src (Src) is a readily targetable
molecule, as Src inhibitors have shown efﬁcacy in clinical trials for
treatment of late-stage cancers (12) and Src acts as a key node of
multiple cancer cell signaling pathways (12, 25). In addition,
analysis of the Total Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) breast tumor
dataset (26) revealed higher phospho-Src-Y416 and total Src
levels in ER breast tumors than in ERþ breast tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Furthermore, increased phospho-Src-Y416
was detected in both HER2-enriched and basal-like ER breast
tumors compared with ERþ luminal type breast tumors, although
higher total Src expression was detected only in basal-like breast
tumors compared with luminal-type breast tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). Therefore, we investigated whether Src
activation plays an important role in ER breast cancer initiation
and may be a feasible target for prevention/intervention of ER
breast cancer.
Targeting Src prevents disorganized growth of ER MECs
Because HER2-overexpressing MECs exhibit higher Src activation (27), to determine the role of Src in ER premalignant MECs
growth, we generated ER MCF10A and MCF12A MECs stable
clones harboring HER2 overexpression (10A.B2 and 12A.B2) or
control vectors (10A.vec and 12A.vec) as in vitro models (Supplementary Fig. S1D; ref. 27). In three-dimensional (3D) culture,
10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells form noninvasive disorganized acinar
structures with ﬁlled lumen due to increased proliferation and
reduced apoptosis compared with the control cells (Fig. 1B,
second column from left and Supplementary Fig. S1G, middle
column). These acinar structures mimic DCIS in patients (27)
and can be used for testing therapeutics (28). On the contrary, the
vector control cells form spherical acinar structures with a hollow
lumen that mimic normal mammary glands in vivo (Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Fig. S1G, left columns; ref. 29). To determine the
role of Src in the disorganized acinar growth of 10A.B2 cells, we
knocked down Src in 10A.B2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1E). In
3D culture, 10A.B2 cells and control shRNA (ctrl.shRNA)-expressing 10A.B2 cells formed disorganized acinar structures, whereas
Src knockdown (Src.sh) resulted in smaller spherical acini structurally similar to those of the 10A.vec cells (Fig. 1B and C).
Staining of markers for apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), proliferation (Ki-67), and basement membrane (laminin 5) showed that
acini formed by 10A.B2.Src.sh cells exhibited fewer proliferating
cells and more apoptotic cells than those of 10A.B2.ctrl.shRNA
cells (Fig. 1B and C). These data demonstrated that Src is required
for apoptosis resistance, MEC proliferation, and the disorganized
acinar growth of 10A.B2 cells in 3D culture. Next, we tested the Src
inhibitor saracatinib for prevention of the growth of disorganized
acini in Src-activated MECs (Fig. 1D). We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that

4866 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

saracatinib indeed inhibited activation of Src and its downstream
targets, such as phospho-FAK-Y576, phospho-P130 Cas-Y410,
and phospho-Paxillin-Y118 in both 10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells in
3D cultures (Supplementary Fig. S1F). We then treated 10A.B2
and 12A.B2 cells with either vehicle or saracatinib (1 mmol/L) on
day 6 of 3D culture, when there was no signiﬁcant difference in
acinar growth of 10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells compared with their
vector control cells (Fig. 1D). Saracatinib indeed prevented the
disorganized acinar growth of 10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells, resulting
in smaller spherical acinar structures with hollow lumina similar
to those of vector control cells (Fig. 1E and F and Supplementary
Fig. S1G and S1H). Saracatinib also induced apoptosis and
inhibited proliferation of acini, as shown by increased cleaved
caspase-3 and decreased Ki-67 and MCM2 (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S1G and S1I).
Targeting Src delays ER mammary tumor development in mice
We next examined the effect of saracatinib on preventing ER
mammary tumors in the MMTV-neu 202 Mul/J (denoted as
MMTV-neu, neu is the rat homologue of human ErbB2/HER2)
mouse model (30). MMTV-neu mouse overexpresses wild-type
HER2 in the mammary gland and progressively develops ER
mammary intraepithelial neoplasia (MIN; 10–18 weeks) and
invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC, 30 weeks onward) lesions
(data not shown). As the well-tolerated saracatinib dose used
for cancer treatment in clinical trials is 175 mg/d (equivalent to
33.2 mg/kg in mouse; ref. 31), we used saracatinib at a lower dose
(25 mg/kg, n ¼ 20) for treating MMTV-neu mice and gave vehicle
to control group (n ¼ 20) and monitored the mice for tumor-free
survival. All mice in the vehicle group developed mammary
tumors by 260 days of age, when 9 of 20 mice in the saracatinib-treated group remained tumor-free (Fig. 2A). Compared with
the vehicle group, saracatinib signiﬁcantly increased tumor-free
[vehicle; T(50) ¼ 211 days, saracatinib; T(50) ¼ 249 days] and
overall [vehicle; T(50) ¼ 258 days, saracatinib; T(50) ¼ 285
days] survival of these mice (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig.
S2A) without obvious toxicity to mice (ref. 32 and data not
shown). Saracatinib signiﬁcantly reduced the development of
hyperplastic, MIN, and IDC lesions (Fig. 2B). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining conﬁrmed that saracatinib treatment
inhibited Src activity in MFPs (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
To monitor mammary tumor progression from hyperplasia to
MIN to IDC during saracatinib treatment in real-time, we implemented the high-resolution micro-endoscopy (HRME), an innovative imaging technology, which has been used as a diagnostic
tool to distinguish normal tissue from benign and neoplastic
tissues in head and neck and cervical cancers (33, 34). Fresh MFPs
from 32-week-old vehicle- and saracatinib-treated mice were
imaged to detect premalignant lesions using HRME with or
without structured illumination (SI), a method of rejecting
out-of-focus light to improve image contrast in thick tissue
samples. The images of HRME with SI (HRME-SI) were coregistered with images obtained from confocal microscopy and
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for comparison of resolutions (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The quality of images from
HRME-SI, which could be applied in real-time in living animals
through a biopsy needle, was comparable with that of confocal
microscopy and H&E staining. The HRME-SI detected MIN lesions
in the vehicle-treated MMTV-neu mice, whereas only hyperplastic
lesions were detected in the saracatinib-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S2B).

We also tested the effect of saracatinib in MMTV-neu NDL 2–5
(referred to as MMTV-neu ) mouse model expressing the activated
neu as female MMTV-neu mice rapidly develop ER mammary
tumors (35). Speciﬁcally, MMTV-neu female mice develop hyperplastic lesions between 8 and 11 weeks, MIN lesions between 11
and 19 weeks, and IDC lesions between 19 and 26 weeks of age
(Fig. 2D). IHC staining of MFP biopsies showed that MMTV-neu
mice developed atypia and MIN lesions with a gradual loss of ER
and increase in Src activation as disease progressed to mammary
tumors (Fig. 2D).
Given the appearance of MIN lesions between 11 and 19 weeks
and an enhanced Src activation (Fig. 2D) in MIN lesions of

MMTV-neu mice, we tested saracatinib for prevention of the
development of ER IDC in this model by starting treatment in
10-week-old female mice. We gave saracatinib (25 mg/kg, n ¼ 20)
to MMTV-neu mice and used vehicle in control group (n ¼ 20).

increased the median tumor-free [vehicle; T(50) ¼ 155 days,

176 days, saracatinib; T(50) ¼ 196 days] survival of mice (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D). To determine whether saracatinib
inhibited Src activation and the appearance of hyperplastic, MIN,

of hyperplastic and MIN lesions but less than 10% IDC lesions.
Indeed, low-dose saracatinib treatment reduced Src activation
(Supplementary Fig. S2E). MFPs from saracatinib-treated mice
exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced number of IDC lesions and fewer
MIN lesions than vehicle-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S2F).
Altogether, these data clearly demonstrated that saracatinib
delayed initiation and progression of premalignant lesions and
increased both tumor-free and overall survival in two mouse
models of ER- and Src-activated mammary tumors.
Src regulates glucose metabolism and GLUT1 expression
Because metabolic alterations are prominent in early-stage
cancers (17), to gain mechanistic insights into the delayed initiation and progression of premalignant lesions by targeting Src, we
performed metabolomic proﬁling of MFPs of vehicle- and saracatinib-treated MMTV-neu mice. Metabolite set enrichment
analysis showed that starch and sucrose metabolism, the pentose
phosphate pathway, and glycolysis were among the most significantly downregulated pathways in response to Src inhibition
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). Glucose 6-phoshate and fructose 6phosphate were among the most inhibited metabolites in

response to saracatinib treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3B and
S3C). Given that glucose 6-phosphate is the common metabolite
of these pathways, we hypothesized that Src inhibition may affect
the availability of glucose to premalignant cells, which would in
turn affect the synthesis of downstream metabolites of the aforementioned pathways. Therefore, we compared glucose uptake by
10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells to their corresponding control cells with
or without saracatinib treatment. Compared with vector control
cells, 10A.B2 and 12A.B2 MECs had a signiﬁcant increase in
glucose uptake, which was inhibited by saracatinib treatment
(Fig. 3A and B). Furthermore, knocking down Src (Supplementary
Fig. S1E and S3D) also signiﬁcantly reduced the glucose uptake
compared with control shRNA transfected cells (Fig. 3C and D).
These data indicate that Src plays an essential role in regulating
glucose uptake.
Transport of glucose across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells is carried out by glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins that
are widely dysregulated in many cancers (36). Mammary glands
predominantly express GLUT1, which also facilitates transport of
mannose and galactose in addition to glucose (37). Particularly,
GLUT1 is expressed at much higher levels compared with other

Prevention of ER Breast Cancer by Targeting Src

members of the GLUT family in mammary tumors of the MMTVneu mouse model (38). To investigate the effect of Src on GLUTs,
we established Src wild-type (wt)-expressing (10A.Src.wt and 12A.
Src.wt) and constitutively active Src.Y527F-expressing (10A.Src.
Y527F and 12A.Src.Y527F) stable sublines from MCF10A and
MCF12A cells, respectively. We examined the expression of
GLUT1-5 and GLUT12, as altered expression of GLUT1-5 has
been reported in many tumors and GLUT12 is highly expressed in
breast tumors (39). 10A.Src.wt and 10A.Src.Y527F sublines had
signiﬁcantly increased GLUT1 expression than 10A.pl.vec, whereas no signiﬁcant changes were observed in GLUT2/3/4/5/12
(Supplementary Fig. S3E). 12A.Src.wt and 12A.Src.Y527 sublines
also exhibited higher expression of GLUT1 than control (Supplementary Fig. S3F). Src.wt and SrcY527F-overexpressing sublines of
MCF10A and MCF12A exhibited higher GLUT1 protein than their
respective vector controls (Fig. 3E and F). Conversely, 10A.B2.Src.
sh and 12A.B2.Src.sh cells had signiﬁcantly reduced GLUT1
protein and mRNA levels compared with control shRNA transfected cells (Fig. 3G–J). Likewise, saracatinib also reduced GLUT1
protein and mRNA expression in 10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells (Fig. 3K
and Supplementary Fig. S3G and S3H). These data indicated that
Src activation increased glucose uptake, at least partly, by upregulating GLUT1 expression. In addition, we examined the effect of
saracatinib on the level of glycolytic enzymes. Saracatinib moderately inhibited HKII and LDHA expressions without changing
PFK-1 (Supplementary Fig. S3I), indicating that some glycolytic
enzymes were affected by Src inhibition but not as dramatic as
GLUT1.
High GLUT1 expression is required for disorganized acinar
growth of ER- and Src-activated MECs
To determine whether GLUT1 is critical for glucose uptake in
ER- and Src-activated MECs, we stably knocked down GLUT1 in
10A.B2 cells (10A.B2.GLUT1.sh; Fig. 4A). Clearly, 10A.B2.GLUT1.
sh cells had reduced glucose uptake compared with control cells
(Fig. 4B), indicating that GLUT1 is the major glucose transporter
responsible for glucose uptake in 10A.B2 cells. Remarkably, 10A.
B2.GLUT1.sh stable cells did not form disorganized acinar structures as 10A.B2 and control shRNA transfected 10A.B2 cells did in
3D culture (Fig. 4C, top, and 4D). Moreover, immunoﬂuorescent
staining showed that silencing GLUT1 resulted in increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation in acini of 10A.B2 cells (Fig. 4C,
bottom). These data indicated that GLUT1 plays an important
role in disorganized acinar growth of ER-, Src-activated 10A.B2
cells by increasing glucose uptake to provide energy.
Src upregulates GLUT1 expression through increasing c-Myc
protein synthesis
To gain mechanistic insights on how Src inhibition reduced
GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake (Fig. 3), we treated 10A.B2
cells grown in 3D culture with either vehicle or saracatinib and

performed RPPA. Among many detected alterations, c-Myc was
one of the top three transcriptional regulators that were downregulated by saracatinib treatment (Supplementary Table S1).
Myc downregulation by saracatinib was validated by immunoblotting in both 10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells (Fig. 5A). As Myc had
been reported to transcriptionally upregulate GLUT1 expression
in Rat-1 ﬁbroblasts (40), we examined whether Myc regulated
GLUT1 expression in 10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells. Myc silencing by
siRNA resulted in decreased GLUT1 at both the protein and mRNA
levels in 10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells (Fig. 5B–D). As the data clearly
demonstrated that Myc regulates GLUT1 expression in these
MECs, we further investigated how Src inhibition affected Myc
expression. Although saracatinib inhibited Myc protein levels of
10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells, it did not inhibit Myc mRNA expression
(Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Myc protein expression was
also dramatically reduced in 3D-cultured 10A.B2.Src.sh and 12A.
B2.Src.sh cells compared with control shRNA transfected cells
(Fig. 5E). In addition, Src.wt- and Src.Y527F transfected MCF10A
and MCF12A cells showed increased Myc protein expression
compared with vector control cells but no signiﬁcant changes in
Myc mRNA levels (Fig. 5F and Supplementary Fig. S4B). These
data indicated that Src regulates Myc at the protein level. Furthermore, Myc protein expression signiﬁcantly correlated with phospho-Src-Y416 level, among human breast tumors in the TCPA
dataset (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
The combination of protein synthesis and stability determines
steady-state protein levels (41). To examine whether Src inhibition affects Myc protein stability, vehicle- or saracatinib-treated
12A.B2 MECs were treated with cycloheximide to block protein
synthesis and cell lysates were collected at different treatment
times (0–60 minutes) followed by Myc immunoblotting. Similar
rates of Myc protein degradation were detected between vehicleand saracatinib-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S4D), indicating
that Src inhibition did not reduce the stability of Myc protein.
To determine the effect of Src inhibition on Myc protein
synthesis, polysome fractions were collected from vehicle- and
saracatinib-treated 10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells. Saracatinib did not
signiﬁcantly change the overall polysome proﬁle compared with
vehicle controls (comparison of Fig. 5G with 5H and Supplementary Fig. S4E with S4F), indicating that Src inhibition did not affect
global protein synthesis. However, saracatinib drastically attenuated polysomal recruitment of Myc mRNA compared with vehicle
(Fig. 5I and J and Supplementary Fig. S4G and S4H), indicating
that saracatinib inhibited Myc protein translation in these MECs.
Src increases Myc protein by enhancing cap-dependent
translation
The synthesis of many oncogenic proteins is promoted by
cap-dependent translation, which is regulated by phosphorylated eIF4E (42–44). The eIF4E is phosphorylated at serine 209
by MAPK signal integrating kinases 1 and 2 (MNK1 and MNK2;

ref. 45). MNK2 is constitutively active, whereas MNK1 is
activated by external stimuli via ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ref. 45). To investigate whether
saracatinib inhibited Myc translation by inhibiting cap-dependent translation, we compared phospho-eIF4E-S209 and its
upstream kinases in vehicle- or saracatinib-treated 10A.B2 and
12A.B2 cells. Saracatinib suppressed phospho-eIF4E-S209 and
its upstream kinases phospho-MNK1-T197/202 and phosphoERK1/2-T202/Y204, but not phospho-p38 MAPK-T180/182, suggesting that Src affects cap-dependent translation via the ERK1/2–
MNK1–eIF4E pathway (Fig. 5K). Furthermore, eIF4E-silenced
10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells showed decreased levels of Myc
protein, conﬁrming cap-dependent translation of Myc in these
cells (Fig. 5L). Thus, saracatinib reduced cap-dependent translation of Myc by inhibiting the ERK1/2–MNK1–eIF4E pathway.
Saracatinib inhibits Myc and GLUT1 expression in mouse
models
Next, we set out to determine whether the above ﬁndings from
3D cultured MECs recapitulated the effects of targeting Src with
saracatinib in mouse models. MFPs collected from vehicle- and
saracatinib-treated MMTV-neu and MMTV-neu mice were compared for Ki-67, Myc, and GLUT1 expression by IHC staining.
Compared with vehicle-treated mice, Ki-67 in MFPs from saracatinib-treated mice was signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S5A), consistent with the delayed tumor onset
and progression observed in these mice (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2A, S2C, and S2D). Myc was signiﬁcantly reduced in
MFPs of saracatinib-treated mice (Fig. 6B and Supplementary
Fig. S5B) with a corresponding reduction of GLUT1 expression
(Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S5C). Together, these in vivo
ﬁndings were consistent with the Src inhibition–mediated
responses in 3D cultured 10A.B2 and 12A.B2 cells, indicating
that targeting Src with saracatinib inhibited Myc expression,
resulting in reduced GLUT1 expression, consequently impeding

glucose metabolism and ER-, Src-activated mammary tumor
initiation and progression.

Discussion
Despite recent advances in treatment, breast cancer accounts for
an estimated 29% (232,670) of new cancer cases, highest among
all female-related cancers, and 15% (40,000) of cancer deaths per
year (1). Effective prevention strategies are needed to reduce
breast cancer deaths. The development of agents to prevent
tamoxifen-unresponsive and ER breast cancer requires better
understanding of the critical molecular alterations driving early
lesion (atypia) progression toward breast cancer. In this study, we
found that Src activation is a targetable molecular alteration in
early-stage Tam-NR atypical lesions of women at higher risk of
developing tamoxifen-unresponsive breast cancer. Here, we show
that saracatinib effectively targets Src and prevents the disorganized acinar growth of HER2-overexpressing, Src-activated, and
ER MECs in 3D culture, a condition mimicking the growth of
premalignant lesions in early-stage breast disease. Importantly,
saracatinib markedly prevented the development of premalignant
lesions and delayed tumor onset in two ER mammary tumor
mouse models with HER2-induced Src activation. These strong
preclinical data have led to the recent initiation of a clinical trial
using a Src inhibitor for secondary prevention of ER breast cancer
at MD Anderson Cancer Center (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer:
NCT01471106).
Previous RPPA analysis in primary breast tumors showed
signiﬁcantly higher Src expression in ERa and progesterone
receptor–negative (PR) tumors than in ERaþ and/or PRþ
tumors, and ERa and Src expression were inversely correlated in
all tumors (46). Deletion of Src in epithelial cells delayed polyomavirus middle-T antigen (PyVmT)-driven ER mammary
tumorigenesis (47). Recently, dasatinib was shown to delay
mammary tumor onset driven by activated HER2 and PTEN loss

Prevention of ER Breast Cancer by Targeting Src

Figure 7.
Schematic showing that Src promotes cap-dependent translation of Myc
protein via activation of the ERK1/2–MNK1–eIF4E pathway, leading to GLUT1
expression, which in turn enhances glucose uptake by premalignant cells by
controlling several metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the pentose
phosphate pathway that contribute to premalignant cells growth.

(48). These studies in advanced breast cancer and mammary
tumor models support our ﬁndings that Src plays an important
role in ER breast cancer progression. However, our current study
represents the ﬁrst discovery that Src activation is a readily
targetable event in women who are at high risk of developing
tamoxifen-unresponsive breast cancer and that Src inhibition
effectively prevents the progression of ER early breast lesions.
Cancer metabolism is a recently recognized hallmark of cancer,
as chronic and uncontrolled cell proliferation often also involves
dysregulation of energy metabolism (49). Recently, clinical trials
implementing caloric restriction and exercise have shown promising results for the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk
women (50). Because of the behavioral difﬁculty in maintaining
a CR diet for a long period of time, currently there is a focus on
identifying and developing agents that could complement, synergize, or mimic the anticancer effects of caloric restriction (51). Our
metabolomic data showed for the ﬁrst time that in an ER breast
cancer model, Src regulates carbohydrate metabolism, partly by
regulating glucose uptake. Our data revealed that Src activation
increases glucose uptake via upregulating GLUT1 and that saracatinib inhibits glucose uptake by downregulating GLUT1, indicating that targeting Src could help to achieve the goals of caloric
restriction by reducing glucose uptake.
Previous microarray analysis showed that genes associated with
increased glucose metabolism signiﬁcantly overlap with those of
an ER molecular phenotype (22), suggesting that increased
glucose metabolism contributes to ER breast cancer develop-

ment. In this study, we were surprised to ﬁnd that GLUT1 silencing
alone prevented the abnormal acinar growth of ER 10A.B2 cells,
indicating that GLUT1 is required for disorganized acinar growth.
Our data provided direct evidence of the critical role of glucose
metabolism in dysregulated growth of ER MECs. Mechanistically, our data showed that Src-mediated GLUT1 upregulation is
Myc-dependent. We revealed that Src promotes cap-dependent
translation of Myc protein via activation of the ERK1/2–MNK1–
eIF4E pathway (Fig. 7). Although Src was found to increase capdependent translation of b-catenin and hypoxia-inducible factor
1 a (42, 43), our data demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that Src
enhances the translation of Myc, a strong oncogene activated by
various mitogenic signals. Consistent with our in-depth mechanistic ﬁndings in vitro, saracatinib also signiﬁcantly inhibited Src
activation and Myc and GLUT1 expression in mouse models.
Together, our data present proof of concept that targeting glucose
metabolism can be a promising approach for future prevention
strategies of ER breast cancer.
The detection of premalignant lesions at the early stages of
cancer development allows for potential early management. In
this study, we applied HRME-SI imaging technology to monitor
mammary tumor progression (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Because
HRME-SI offers several advantages over traditional measures, for
example, low cost, real-time imaging, ease of interpretation at the
point-of-care, and visualization of cellular and architectural features (52–54), we have begun testing the HRME-SI imaging
technology in human breast cancer surgical specimens, aiming
at bring the pilot imaging strategies to the clinic in the near future.
In summary, we identiﬁed Src activation as a targetable alteration for prevention of ER breast cancer and demonstrated that
targeting Src with saracatinib delayed ER mammary tumor
initiation and progression. The prevention strategies developed
in this study can be immediately implemented to test a wide range
of cancer prevention agents. Our approach here could be ultimately developed to achieve a signiﬁcant reduction in mortality
from ER breast cancer.
