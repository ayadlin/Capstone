ABSTRACT
Despite improvements in surgical procedures and chemotherapy, pancreatic
cancer remains one of the most aggressive and fatal human malignancies, with a
low 5-year survival rate of only 8%. Therefore, novel strategies for prevention and
treatment are urgently needed. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the
anti-pancreatic cancer effects dihydroartemisinin (DHA). Microarray and systematic
analysis showed that DHA suppressed proliferation, inhibited angiogenesis and
promoted apoptosis in two different human pancreatic cancer cell lines, and that 5
DHA-regulated microRNAs and 11 of their target mRNAs were involved in these effects
via 19 microRNA-mRNA interactions. Four of these microRNAs, 9 of the mRNAs and
17 of the interactions were experimentally verified. Furthermore, we found that the
anti-pancreatic caner effects of DHA in vivo involved 4 microRNAs, 9 mRNAs and
17 microRNA-mRNA interactions. These results improve the understanding of the
mechanisms by which DHA suppresses proliferation and angiogenesis and promotes
apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells and indicate that DHA, an effective antimalarial
drug, might improve pancreatic cancer treatments.

3’-untranslated regions (3’-UTR) of target genes through
complementary base pairing, and play significant roles in a
variety of biological processes, particularly in cancer cells
[4, 5]. MicroRNAs negatively regulate their targets by
degrading mRNA or inhibiting its translation. microRNAs
may target more than 30% of human genes [6] and
regulate survival, apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis,
invasion, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance during
the initiation and progression of human cancers[7–9].
Therefore, strategies that modulate microRNAs to regulate
tumor amplification, apoptosis, metastasis, and invasion
may provide promising novel treatments for pancreatic
cancer.
Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the main active
metabolite of the artemisinin derivative antimalarial
drugs, has anticancer effects in pancreatic cancer [10],
lung cancer [11], breast cancer [12], cervical cancer
[13], and glioma [14], and inhibits angiogenesis in
cancer [15, 16]. We previously found that DHA induces

INTRODUCTION
Despite decades of effort to improve treatments,
pancreatic cancer remains one of the most aggressive
and deadly human tumors, with a five-year survival rate
of only 8% [1]. Pancreatic cancer is currently the eighth
and ninth leading cause of worldwide cancer-related death
in men and women, respectively [2]. However, patients
who are treated with multimodal therapy, including
surgical resection, have a 5-year survival rate of more
than 20% [3]. This unfavorable prognosis for pancreatic
cancer is primarily due to the poor therapeutic effects of
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the aggressive biological
behavior of pancreatic tumors, and late diagnoses.
Alternative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to
more effectively treat this deadly disease.
MicroRNAs, a family of non-coding RNAs
approximately 21-23 nucleotides in length, regulate

G0/G1 cell cycle arrest [10] and apoptosis [17], inhibits
growth [17] and angiogenesis [15], and increases
sensitivity to chemotherapy [18, 19] in pancreatic
cancer. However, the details of the mechanisms
underlying DHA’s anti-pancreatic cancer effects have
not been fully described; here, we further investigated
these mechanisms.
Many experiments have confirmed that microRNAs
play important roles as either promotors or inhibitors
of cancer [20–22]. However, few experiments have
demonstrated that drugs directly influence the ability of
microRNAs to modulate their target genes and thus affect
survival, apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion,
metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance in cancer. In this
study, we examined differentially expressed microRNAs
from microarray profiles, confirmed microRNA-mRNA
interactions using experimentally validated databases, and
conducted a functional enrichment analysis of pathways
from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reactions and western blots, to investigate the mechanisms
underlying DHA’s anti-pancreatic cancer effects.

Aberrant microRNA expression profiles in
PANC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells
MicroRNA expression profiles in DHA-treated
and control PANC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer
cells were examined using a microRNA microarray.
microRNA expression results were normalized using
median normalization and used to screen for differentially
expressed microRNAs. Differentially expressed
microRNAs were identified via fold-change filtering
between the two groups in each cell line; a fold-change
≥ 1.5 identified microRNAs as up- or down-regulated.
The identified microRNAs were then filtered between the
two cell lines such that microRNAs for which expression
was similarly up- or down-regulated in both PANC-1 and
BxPC-3 cells were considered differentially expressed
microRNAs. Seventy microRNAs that were up-regulated
and 109 that were down-regulated (fold change ≥ 1.5) in
both PANC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells were
identified using these filters (Figure 1).

Identification of DHA-associated microRNAmRNA interaction networks

Identification of DHA-associated microRNApathway regulation networks

Four
high-confidence
microRNA-mRNA
interaction databases (miR2Disease, miRecords,
TarBase and miRTarBase) were used together to screen
the experimentally identified differentially expressed
microRNAs and their targets in DHA-treated cells.
As shown in Figure 2A, 5,092 microRNA-mRNA
interactions were identified between 62 of the 179
differentially expressed microRNAs (117 had no
significant interactions) and 4,362 mRNAs. The node
degree distribution of this network revealed a scale-free
structure, with R2=0.86. These results indicate that the
DHA-associated microRNA-mRNA interaction network
is well-characterized by a core set of post-transcriptional
regulatory relationships that are distinct from those of
randomly generated networks (25800746).

To determine which molecular pathways are
regulated by these differentially expressed microRNAs
in response to DHA treatment, a functional enrichment
analysis was performed based on the microRNA-mRNA
interaction network. Neighbor mRNA nodes in the
network for each microRNA were used as input gene
sets to examine relationships with hundreds of KEGG
pathways. The hypergeometric test was used to identify
significantly enriched pathways (p<0.05). As shown in
Figure 2C, 204 microRNA-pathway interactions were
identified, involving 33 microRNAs and 59 pathways.
In the microRNA-pathway interaction network, several
important cancer-related pathway categories, such as
“pathways in cancer,” “cell cycle,” “P53 signaling,” and
“pancreatic cancer pathways,” were connected to more

Characteristics of microRNAs that regulate the
pancreatic cancer pathway

To assess the regulatory relationships between the
microRNAs and target mRNAs identified via microarray
and systematic analysis, we next transfected PANC-1 and
BxPC-3 cells with miR-34a-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-30c5p, or miR-130b-3p or their inhibitors and examined the
protein levels of their target mRNAs, including Cdk4,
Cdk6, VEGF, IKKα, MEK1, E2F3, Rac1, E2F1, and
CDC42 in western blots.
As shown in Figure 4, miR-30c-5p overexpression
reduced Rac1, MEK1, and E2F3 levels in both PANC-1
and BxPC-3 cells. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous
miR-30c-5p increased Rac1, MEK1, and E2F3 levels
compared to the control group. Similarly, miR-195-5p
overexpression reduced, and inhibition of endogenous
miR-195-5p increased, IKKα, CDC42, VEGF, Cdk4,
Cdk6, and E2F3 levels in both PANC-1 and BxPC3 cells compared to the control group. miR-34a-5p

To investigate the mechanisms by which DHA
exerts anti-pancreatic cancer effects, we examined
the pancreatic cancer pathway identified in the DHAassociated microRNA-pathway regulation network.
The comprehensive pancreatic cancer pathway includes
the PI3K-Akt, MAPK, ErbB, Jak-STAT, VEGF, p53,
and TGF-β signaling pathways, as well as cell cycle
and apoptosis pathways. A detailed examination of the
microRNA target sites in the pancreatic pathway map is
shown in Figure 3. Eleven key pancreatic cancer pathway
mRNAs were regulated by 5 microRNAs. For example,
miR-34a-5p regulated Cdk4, and miR-195-5p regulated
CDC42; both miR-34a-5p and miR-195-5p were upregulated by DHA and co-regulated Cdk6, VEGF, E2F3,
and Cdk4; the up-regulated microRNA miR-30c-5p
regulated Rac1, and co-regulated MEK1 with miR-34a-

were up-regulated by DHA, suppressed growth and
angiogenesis, and promoted apoptosis in pancreatic cancer
cells, and their target mRNAs (Cdk4, Cdk6, VEGF, IKKα,
MEK1, E2F3, Rac1, E2F1, and CDC42), were analyzed
with qRT-PCR.
As shown in Figure 5, miR-34a-5p, miR-1955p, miR-30c-5p, and miR-130b-3p were up-regulated
in DHA-treated PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells compared
to vehicle-treated controls, confirming the microarray
results. Additionally, Cdk4, Cdk6, VEGF, IKKα, MEK1,

and CFPAC-1 cells (Supplementary Figure S1). All of
the microRNAs (miR-34a-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-30c-5p,
and miR-130b-3p) were also analyzed with qRT-PCR in

Western blots revealed that Cdk4, Cdk6, VEGF, IKKα,

PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells that were treated with 50 μM
DHA for 72 h (Figure 6). Similar results were obtained in
SW1990 and CFPAC-1 cells (Supplementary Figure S3).

To determine protein levels of the mRNAs
modulated by DHA via microRNAs, we next examined
Cdk4, Cdk6, VEGF, IKKα, MEK1, E2F3, Rac1, E2F1,

angiogenesis, and promote apoptosis in DHA-treated and
vehicle-treated pancreatic cancer cells.

To confirm that the microRNAs identified by
microarray and systematic analysis contribute to the antipancreatic cancer effects of DHA, western blots were used
to measure target mRNA protein levels in the presence
of microRNA inhibitors. As shown in Supplementary

Rac1 levels compared to the control group. However,
transfection of AMO-195-5p, AMO-34a-5p, or AMO-30c5p reversed this DHA-induced inhibition compared to the
group treated with DHA alone. These results indicate that
the anti-pancreatic cancer effects of DHA were mediated
at least partly by miR-195-5p, mir-34a-5p, and mir-30c-5p.

DHA treatment reduced microvessel density compared
to the vehicle-treated group (Figure 7D). DHA treatment
also increased the percentage of TUNEL positive cells
compared to the vehicle-treated group (Figure 7D).
To analyze the mechanism by which DHA
suppresses growth, inhibits angiogenesis, and promotes
apoptosis in tumor tissues, expression of the microRNAs
(miR-34a-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-30c-5p, and miR-130b3p) that were up-regulated by DHA and their target
mRNAs (Cdk4, Cdk6, VEGF, IKKα, MEK1, E2F3, Rac1,
E2F1, and CDC42) were analyzed using qRT-PCR. As
shown in Figure 8A, miR-34a-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-30c5p, and miR-130b-3p were up-regulated in the DHAtreated group compared to the vehicle-treated group,
confirming the microarray results in vivo. Additionally,
Cdk4, Cdk6, VEGF, IKKα, MEK1, E2F3, Rac1, E2F1,
and CDC42 mRNA expression were down-regulated in
the DHA-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated
group, experimentally confirming the microarray results
and systematic database analysis in vivo (Figure 8B).
We then measured protein levels of Cdk4, Cdk6,
VEGF, IKKα, MEK1, E2F3, Rac1, E2F1, and CDC42,
the mRNAs of which were down-regulated by DHA
via microRNAs, and which affect growth, inhibit
angiogenesis, and promote apoptosis. Western blots
showed that tumors from mice treated with 10 mg/kg DHA

DHA suppresses growth, inhibits angiogenesis,
and promotes apoptosis in vivo
To examine the anti-tumor effects of DHA in vivo,
we established a xenograft pancreatic cancer model in
nude mice that did or did not receive 18 days of DHA
treatment (Figure 7A). Tumor sizes were measured every
three days, and volumes were estimated according to the
formula V=(π/6)×(larger diameter)×(smaller diameter)2
(Figure 7B). DHA treatment decreased tumor volumes
over time compared to the control group. Mice were
sacrificed and tumors excised after treatment (Figure 7C).
To evaluate the anti-proliferation, anti-angiogenesis,
and apoptotic effects of DHA in tumor tissues, Ki-67 (a
cell proliferation marker) and CD31 (a microvessel density
marker) levels and TUNEL staining were examined using
immunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 7D, tumors
from DHA-treated mice had fewer Ki-67-positive cells
than those from the vehicle-treated group. Similarly,

MEK1, E2F3, Rac1, E2F1, and CDC42 levels compared
to control group mice (Figure 8C).

DHA is an effective anti-malarial drug, and many
studies have revealed that DHA also has anticancer effects
in a variety of cancers. In a previous study, we found that
DHA suppressed pancreatic cancer cell growth both in
vitro and in vivo [17]. We also found that DHA downregulated cdks and cyclins, such as Cdk4, Cdk6, and
cyclin E, which play essential roles in the regulation of cell
cycle progression; DHA thus increased G0/G1 cell cycle
arrest in pancreatic cancer cells. More importantly, DHA
inhibited the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in pancreatic
cancer cells [10]. Furthermore, DHA increased the antipancreatic cancer effects of gemcitabine by inactivating
NF-κB both in vitro and in vivo [18] and suppressed
angiogenesis by regulating the NF-κB pathway [15].
Finally, we found that DHA enhanced Apo2L/TRAILmediated apoptosis via ROS-mediated up-regulation of
death receptor 5 [19]. In summary, we have demonstrated
that DHA, in addition to curing malaria, is a promising
chemotherapeutic agent for treating pancreatic cancer.
However, the mechanisms underlying the anti-pancreatic

DISCUSSION
The American Cancer Society estimates that
approximately 53,070 Americans will be diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer in 2016. Despite significant efforts to
improve treatments, 41,780 Americans will die from
pancreatic cancer, which has a five-year survival rate
of only 8% [1]. Gemcitabine, a broad spectrum drug
used to treat solid tumors, is well-tolerated in pancreatic
cancer patients. However, patients who show initial
sensitivity to gemcitabine chemotherapy rapidly acquire
resistance, and the efficacy of gemcitabine in treating
pancreatic cancer remains at only 20-30% [9, 23].
Therefore, novel and effective chemotherapeutic agents
for the treatment of pancreatic cancer are urgently
needed.

cancer effects of DHA are not fully understood. Therefore,
we investigated the mechanisms by which DHA exerts
anti-pancreatic cancer effects using microarray profiles
and systematic analyses.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine
differences in microRNA expression after DHA treatment
using microarrays and systematically analyze DHAassociated microRNA-mRNA interaction networks to
identify the mechanisms by which DHA exerts its anticancer effects. Surprisingly, we found that four crucial
microRNAs (miR-34a-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-30c-5p, and
miR-130b-3p) regulated the expression of many mRNAs
(Cdk4, Cdk6, VEGF, IKKα, MEK1, E2F3, Rac1, E2F1,
ERK1, and CDC42) and their proteins, and thus were
crucial to the anti-pancreatic cancer effects of DHA.
Cdk4, Cdk6, E2F3, and E2F1 play key roles in
the regulation of cell cycle progression in pancreatic
cancer. Down-regulation of Cdk4, Cdk6, E2F3, and E2F1
expression increases G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in pancreatic
cancer cells [24, 25]. Here, we found that DHA treatment
up-regulated miR-34a-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-130b-3p,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and miR-30c-5p expression and down-regulated the
expression of the target mRNAs Cdk4, Cdk6, E2F3, and
E2F1, respectively; DHA treatment also decreased protein
levels translated from these mRNAs. VEGF plays a key
role in angiogenesis [26], and down-regulation of VEGF
expression suppresses angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer.
Here, we found that DHA treatment down-regulated
VEGF mRNA expression and protein levels by upregulating the expression of miR-34a-5p and miR-195-5p.
The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signalling pathway, which
is one of best-characterized kinase cascades in cancer
cell biology, influences various processes in tumors,
including cancer cell survival, proliferation, migration,
and differentiation [27]. MEK1 and ERK1 play key roles
in the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signalling pathway [28]. In this
study, DHA treatment up-regulated miR-34a-5p and miR30c-5p and down-regulated MEK1 mRNA expression
and protein levels, which both microRNAs target. These
results indicate that the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signalling
pathway is involved in the anti-pancreatic cancer effects
of DHA. CDC42, a Rho family GTPase, also plays an
62468

Oncotarget

important role in various cancers [29, 30] and promotes
proliferation and metastasis [31, 32]. Here, the DHAinduced increase in miR-195-5p down-regulated CDC42
expression, likely contributing to the ability of DHA
to inhibit proliferation and suppress metastasis. Rac1,
another Rho family GTPase, is also involved in various
cancers, and down-regulation of Rac1 expression inhibits
proliferation, viability, and migration in pancreatic cancer
cells [33]. Here, DHA-induced, miR-30c-5p-mediated
down-regulation of Rac1 expression might be another
novel mechanism by which DHA inhibits cancer cell
proliferation, viability, and migration.
In a previous study, we found that, although total
NF-κB levels did not change, DHA treatment downregulated nuclear NF-κB levels in a dose-dependent
manner [10]. Therefore, DHA prevented the transfer
of NF-κB into the nucleus, and down-regulated gene
products downstream of NF-κB, thus promoting
apoptosis, suppressing growth, inhibiting angiogenesis,
and increasing sensitivity to chemotherapy in pancreatic
cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which DHA
prevents transport of NF-κB into the nucleus are unknown.
Surprisingly, in the present study, DHA treatment upregulated miR-195-5p, which down-regulated IKKα
mRNA expression. IKK phosphorylates and degrades IκB
in a ubiquitination-dependent manner; this prevents the
translocation of the RelA(P65) and NF-κB1(P50) dimer,
which is sequestered in the cytoplasm in its inactive state
via interaction with the endogenous inhibitor IκB [34, 35].
This mechanism may explain the ability of DHA to inhibit
the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in pancreatic cancer
cells.
In summary, we found that the DHA-induced
microRNA-mRNA regulatory network suppressed
growth, inhibited angiogenesis, and promoted apoptosis
in pancreatic cancer. Our results provide mechanistic
evidence that the anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and
anti-angiogenesis effects of DHA were associated with
the up-regulation of miR-34a-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-30c-5,
and miR-130b-3p. While some of these results confirmed
our previous findings, most of them identified novel
mechanisms underlying the anti-pancreatic cancer effects
of DHA, which may be effective not only in treating
malaria but also as a chemotherapeutic drug for treating
pancreatic cancer.

microRNAs that were differentially expressed between the
treatment groups were identified using microarrays. 179
differentially expressed microRNAs were identified using
two standards: first, the microRNAs were up- or downregulated with a fold-change in expression ≥ 1.5; second,
the microRNAs were differentially expressed similarly in
both PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cell lines. Next, microRNAmRNA interactions were identified using the miR2Disease,
miRecords, TarBase, and miRTarBase databases; only
microRNAs with confirmed target relationships in
these databases were examined further. Based on the
microRNA-mRNA interaction data, a DHA-associated
microRNA-pathway regulatory network was identified,
and the “pancreatic cancer pathway” specifically was
selected for further investigation. Five microRNAs, 11
mRNAs, and 19 microRNA-mRNA interactions identified
in the pancreatic cancer pathway were investigated to
determine their roles in the mechanisms underlying the
anti-pancreatic cancer effects of DHA. The differentially
expressed microRNAs and mRNAs identified in this
way were measured in vitro and in vivo using qRTPCR, and levels of the protein products of these mRNAs
were measured in vitro and in vivo using western blots.
ThemicroRNA-target mRNA regulatory relationships
selected by microarray and systematic analysis were
confirmed with western blots in vitro. Finally, the antitumor effects of DHA were examined in vivo by measuring
tumor sizes and via immunohistochemistry.

were from HyClone China Ltd. (China). Mycoplasma
contamination was tested using the Mycoplasma Stain
Assay Kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing,
China); none of the cell cultures were contaminated with
mycoplasma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strategy
As shown in Figure 1, a multi-step approach was
used to identify differentially expressed microRNAs
that were up-regulated by DHA and, in turn, the
mRNAs regulated by these miRNAs, in two pancreatic
cancer cell lines. First, PANC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic
cancer cells were treated with DHA or vehicle, and the

through fold-change filtering. Hierarchical clustering was
performed using MEV software (v4.6, TIGR).

Subconfluent cells (60-70%) were treated with 50
μM DHA in DMSO in complete cell culture medium;
control group cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO.
Subsequent experiments were repeated three times.

MicroRNA-mRNA interaction network
The experimentally verified miR2Disease
(18927107), miRecords (18996891), TarBase (22135297),
and miRTarBase (24304892) databases were used
to identify microRNA-mRNA interaction networks;
43,260 non-redundant, validated microRNA-mRNA
pairs were identified. Among these interactions, 5,092
microRNA-mRNA pairs were associated with 62 of the
179 differentially expressed microRNAs (there were no
associations for the remaining 107) and incorporated into
the microRNA-mRNA interaction network. Cytoscape
software (version 3.2.1) (14597658) was used to construct
and illustrate the network.

RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted and isolated using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity and
quality were measured using a NanoDrop ND-2000
spectrophotometer. Acceptable OD A260/A280 ratios were
between 1.8 and 2.1 (the target is approximately 2.0 for
pure RNA), and OD A260/A230 ratios were greater than
1.8. RNA integrity was assessed by standard denaturing
agarose gel electrophoresis.

Functional enrichment analysis

MicroRNA microarray procedure

A hypergeometric test was used to calculate the
significance of the enriched genes in KEGG pathways. If
the whole genome had a total of N genes, of which K were
involved in the biological pathway under investigation,
and a total of M microRNA target genes, of which x
were involved in the same pathway, were being analyzed,
then the p value for the enrichment of that pathway was
calculated as follows:

After RNA was isolated from the samples, the
miRCURY™ Hy3™/Hy5™ Power labeling kit (Exiqon,
Vedbaek, Denmark) was used to label microRNAs
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. One
microgram of each sample was 3'-end-labeled with the
Hy3TM fluorescent label using T4 RNA ligase and the
following procedure. RNA was suspended in 2.0 μL of
water and combined with 1.0 μL of CIP buffer and CIP
(Exiqon). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37°C,
and the reaction was terminated by incubation for 5 min
at 95°C. Then, 3.0 μL of labeling buffer, 1.5 μL of the
fluorescent label (Hy3TM), 2.0 μL of DMSO, and 2.0 μL of
labeling enzyme were added to the mixture. The labeling
reaction was incubated for 1 h at 16°C and terminated by
incubation for 15 min at 65°C. The Hy3TM-labeled samples
were then hybridized on the miRCURYTM LNA Array
(v.18.0) (Exiqon) according to the array manual. The entire
samples (Hy3TM-labeled samples in 25 μL of hybridization
buffer) were denatured for 2 min at 95°C, incubated on ice
for 2 min, and then hybridized to the microarray for 16-20
h at 56°C in a 12-Bay Hybridization System (Nimblegen
Systems, Inc., Madison, WI, USA), which provides active
mixing action at a constant incubation temperature to
improve hybridization uniformity and enhance signals.
Following hybridization, the slides were washed several
times using the Wash buffer kit (Exiqon) and dried by
centrifugation for 5 min at 400 rpm. The slides were
then scanned using the Axon GenePix 4000B microarray
scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The scanned
images were imported into GenePix Pro 6.0 software
(Axon) for grid alignment and data extraction. Replicate
microRNAs were averaged, and microRNAs with
intensities ≥30 in all samples were used to calculate the
normalization factor. The expression data were normalized
using median normalization. After normalization,
differentially expressed microRNAs were identified

The pathways with p<0.05 were considered

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from DHA-treated and
vehicle-treated PANC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer
cells using the Ultrapure RNA Kit (CWBio Co., Ltd.)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The firststrand cDNA was synthesized using the HiFi-MMLV
cDNA Kit (CWBio Co., Ltd.) for mRNA and using the
miRNA cDNA Kit (CWBio Co., Ltd.) for miRNA. Realtime PCR was performed with the UltraSYBR Mixture
(with ROX) (CWBio Co., Ltd.) for mRNA and the miRNA
Real-Time PCR Assay kit for miRNA (CWBio Co., Ltd.)
to quantify relative mRNA and miRNA expression. The
reactions were run on a 7500 FAST Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). The PCR primer pairs are
listed in Table 1. The reverse primers for miRNA were
provided in the miRNA Real-Time PCR Assay kit. The
relative expression of each gene was calculated using the
comparative fold-change method (2-ΔΔct). β-actin and U6
were used as internal controls for mRNA and microRNA
expression, respectively.

Western blot

Transfection of microRNAs

Proteins were extracted measured with western
blots as previously described [36–38]. Cells that
had been treated with 50 μM DHA or vehicle were
harvested, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, sonicated
in RIPA buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology,
Beijing, China), and homogenized. The debris was
removed by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at
4°C, and protein concentrations were determined using
the BCA Protein assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Samples containing equal amounts of
protein (50 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on
10% or 15% polyacrylamide SDS gels (100 V for 1 to
2 hours) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membranes by electroblotting (100 V for 1
hour at 4°C). Running and transfer times and voltages
were altered slightly as needed to optimize results. The
membranes were then blocked by incubation with 5%
skim milk in TBST buffer (TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20)
for 2 hours and then incubated with the appropriate
primary antibody overnight at 4°C with gentle
agitation. The membranes were then washed several
times and incubated with the appropriate horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 1 hour at room
temperature. Finally, membranes were washed again
and protein bands were visualized with an enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) kit, followed by exposure to
X-ray film. β-actin was simultaneously measured as a
loading control.

miR-34a-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-30c-5p, miR130b-3p, mir-34a-5p specific inhibitor (miR-34a5p antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide, AMO-34a5p), mir-195-5p specific inhibitor (miR-195-5p
antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide, AMO-195-5p),
mir-30c-5p specific inhibitor (miR-30c-5p antisense
oligodeoxyribonucleotide,
AMO-30c-5p),
mir130b-3p specific inhibitor (miR-130b-3p antisense
oligodeoxyribonucleotide, AMO-130b-3p), and negative
control miRNA (NC) were obtained from RiboBio
(Guangzhou, China). Pancreatic cancer cells at 70-80%
confluence were transfected with each microRNA using
the riboFectTM CP transfection kit (RiboBio) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. 48 h after transfection, the
protein levels of mRNAs targeted by the microRNAs,
including Cdk4, Cdk6, VEGF, IKKα, MEK1, E2F3, Rac1,
E2F1, and CDC42, were detected by western blot.

Animal tumor model and treatments
Female nude BALB/c mice (4-6 weeks old) were
purchased from the Animal Research Center at The First
Clinical Medical School of Harbin Medical University
(Harbin, China). All animal procedures were approved
and reviewed by the Animal Care and Use Committee
of The First Clinical Medical School of Harbin
Medical University. BxPC-3 cells were used for in vivo
experiments. 5×106 cells were subcutaneously injected into
the flanks of mice to establish tumors. Tumor sizes were

were estimated according to the formula V=(π/6)×(larger
diameter)×(smaller diameter)2. When tumors reached
approximately 120 mm3, mice were randomly assigned to
one of two groups (five mice per group): the control group
(once daily i.p. injection of DMSO dissolved in 200 μL
PBS) or the DHA-treated group (10 mg/kg, once daily by
i.p. injection). The DHA dose used in this experiment was
selected based on preliminary experiments and a previous
study [17]. Mice were closely monitored. After eighteen
days, all mice were euthanized and tumors were excised.
Each tumor was divided in two: the first tumor sample
was fixed with 10% buffered formalin, and the second was
stored at -80% for further analysis.
