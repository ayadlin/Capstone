ABSTRACT:
Increased expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and activation of the
PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway are common aberrations in prostate cancer (PCa). For
this reason, inhibition of such targets is an exciting avenue for the development of
novel therapeutic strategies to treat patients with advanced PCa. Previous reports
demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) increases DNA damage and induce
greater apoptosis in PCa cell lines that express androgen receptor (AR). In this study
we utilized the AR negative PCa cell line and observed that re-expression of AR
(PC3-AR) results in greater levels of apoptosis when treated with the pan-DACi,
panobinostat (PAN). PAN mediated apoptosis in PC3 and PC3-AR cells was associated
with increased levels of double strand DNA breaks, indicated by p-ɣH2AX. Further,
PAN treatment in PC3-AR cells resulted in moderate attenuation of the ATM-Akt-ERK
DNA damage response pathway. For this reason, we combined PAN with the dual
PI3K-mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235. Combination of PAN with BEZ235 resulted in significant
attenuation of the DNA damage repair protein ATM and significantly increased antitumor activity compared to each single treatment. Overall, superior anti-tumor activity
with combination of PAN with BEZ235 was independent of AR status. These findings
suggest that this therapeutic strategy should be further developed in clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

agents [1-5]. Although these therapies have resulted in
increased survival benefits for CRPC patients, sustainable
suppression of CRPC growth still remains a primary
challenge and novel treatment strategies are still required.
Histone deactelyases (HDACs) are demonstrated
to be over-expressed in multiple cancers, including
prostate cancer [6-8]. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are a
heterogeneous group of epigenetic therapies which alter
histone and non-histone protein function [9]. HDACi

Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) represents
an aggressive and incurable phenotype of prostate cancer.
Until recently, patients who progressed after receiving
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) had minimal second
line therapeutic options available. Within the last 2 years
a dramatic shift in the therapeutic landscape for CRPC
has emerged, resulting in the FDA approval of 5 novel

have demonstrated preclinical and clinical efficacy as
monotherapy [10, 11] and also combination therapy
[12, 13]. HDACi have a diverse range of anticancer
activity including induction of tumor cell apoptosis [10],
suppression of angiogenesis [14] and DNA damage repair
(DDR) [15] and induction of DNA damage by double
strand DNA breaks (DSB) [16].
The PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling axis is often
constitutively activated in prostate cancer, primarily due
to loss of expression/function of the tumor suppressor
gene Pten [17]. Recently, Akt signaling has been
implicated in modulating DNA damage responses and
genomic instability [18]. Akt activation in response to
DNA damage has been shown to be induced by the PI3like kinase kinases (PI3KK) ataxia telangiectasia-mutated
(ATM), ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) and
DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), all of which
are activated by DNA damage [19]. Activation of Akt by
these PIKKs in response to DNA damage is proposed to
initiate prosurvival signaling via Akt mediated cell cycle
arrest and anti-apoptotic mechanisms [20-23].
Selective mTORC1 inhibitors including rapamycin
and its analogs have been investigated for the treatment
of prostate cancer, though with limited success. This
failure is thought to be due to the reciprocal feedback
loop and activation of rapamycin-insensitive (mTORC2)
mTOR complex leading to Akt activation [24-26] and
increased activity of AR [12]. Accordingly, inhibitors that
target PI3K and both rapamycin-sensitive (mTORC1)
and –insensitive (mTORC2) have been developed [27].
These inhibitors demonstrate successful abrogation of the
feedback activation of Akt.
BEZ235 (Novartis) is an orally available PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor [27] that demonstrated efficacy in
inhibiting tumor growth in preclinical mouse models
[28-35]. Treatment with BEZ235 of multiple tumor
types has resulted in potent inhibition of Akt, mTORC1
and mTORC2 activity. However, it has been recently
demonstrated that BEZ235 inhibits the DDR proteins
DNA-PK and ATM [36], both which share high homology
of their catalytic domain with PI3K [37].
The PC3 androgen independent prostate cancer cell
line, which is devoid of AR, Pten and p53 expression is
shown to be resistant to HDACi mediated apoptosis. In
our study, we have utilized a PC3 cell line that expresses
AR (PC3-AR) to demonstrate that treatment of PC3-AR
cells with the pan-DACi panobinostat induces apoptosis.
Panobinostat treatment resulted in comparable reduction
of activated Akt and ATM in PC3 cells and PC3-AR
cells. However, we observed a dramatic increase of
double strand breaks in PC3-AR cells compared to PC3
cells. Further, we determine that in vivo, combination
of panobinostat with BEZ235 resulted in greater antitumor activity compared to single treatment against
PC3 and PC3-AR tumors. Anti-tumor activity mediated
by panobinostat/BEZ235 combination was associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with sustained or increased levels of DNA damage with
concurrent reduction of the DDR protein ATM. These data
suggest that combination of panobinostat and BEZ235
results in superior therapeutic efficacy that is independent
of AR and p53 status. We conclude that combined HDAC
and DDR inhibition represents a novel therapeutic strategy
for advanced and/or CRPC.

RESULTS
Androgen receptor expression sensitizes PC3 cells to
HDACi mediated apoptosis. PC3 and PC3-AR cells were
exposed for 24 and 48 hours to increasing concentrations
of the HDACi panobinostat (PAN) and plasma membrane
integrity assessed by uptake of propidium iodide (PI).
Initial confirmation of the functional status of AR
expressed in PC3-AR cells is shown in supplement
Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1A, only 100nM PAN slightly
increased killing of PC3 cells. In contrast, low-nanomolar
concentrations of PAN were sufficient to kill PC3-AR
cells in a time dependent manner (Fig. 1B). We next
assessed the biochemical changes that occurred after
treatment of PC3 and PC3-AR cells with PAN. Only PC3AR cells treated with 100nM PAN displayed hallmark
features of apoptosis compared to the same treatment of
PC3 cells. These included increased cell surface exposure
of phosphatidyserine (Fig. 1C and 1D) and caspase
activation (Fig. 1E). Further, treatment of PC3 and PC3AR cells with 100nM PAN resulted in accumulation
of subG1 population in PC3-AR cells indicating DNA
fragmentation, whereas the same treatment resulted in
cell cycle arrest of PC3 cells in the G2M phase of the cell
cycle (Fig. 2).

Panobinostat treatment increases DNA damage
and suppresses expression of activated ATM, Akt
and Erk1/2 protein.
It had been previously demonstrated that HDACi
possess the ability to induce DNA damage and apoptosis
[16]. Further, PC3 cells are devoid of Pten, leading to
constitutive activation of Akt, and it is documented
that part of the DNA damage response pathway can be
mediated through ATM-Akt-Erk1/2 signaling [38]. We
therefore examined the sensitivity of this pathway in
response to PAN. PC3 and PC3-AR cells treated with
increasing concentrations for 24 hours showed a dose
dependent increase in DNA damage, as indicated by
protein levels of p-ɣH2AX (Fig. 3). Increases in DNA
damage were most noticeable at a PAN concentration
of 100nM (PC3; 4.5 fold increase, PC3-AR; 14 fold
increase), which correlated with the PAN mediated cell
killing in both cell lines. Further examination revealed that
100nM PAN resulted in similar attenuation of p-ATM and
p-Akt in both cell lines (Fig. 3). PAN treatment (100nM)

in PC3 cells decreased p-Erk1/2 levels, though at the same
concentration, p-Erk1/2 levels were increased in PC3-AR
cells (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results suggest that the
greater accumulation of DNA damage in PC3-AR cells
following PAN treatment may partially explain the ability
of PAN to induce apoptosis in AR expressing PC3 cells.
Combination of panobinostat and BEZ235 results in
increased apoptosis in PC3 and PC3-AR cells. BEZ235
has recently been reported to inhibit the DNA damage
response through attenuation of DNA-PKCs and ATM
[35, 36]. Investigation of these two agents in combination
treatment of PC3 and PC3-AR cells resulted in significant
increase in apoptosis compared to each single treatment
(Fig. 4A and Fig. 4B; PC3, p=0.01 combination verse
single treatment and PC-AR, p=0.0002 combination verse
single treatment as determined by one-way ANOVA).
Initial immunoblot performed demonstrated that BEZ235
induced potent inhibition of the downstream targets of
mTORC1, p-4EBP1 and p-S6K (supplement Fig. 3A).
Next, we examined if increased apoptosis following
combination treatment was associated with increased DNA
damage and loss of activated ATM, Akt and Erk1/2. PAN
treatment of either cell line increased levels of p-ɣH2AX
as expected and was maintained in combination treatment

(Fig. 4C). Combination treatment resulted in similar loss
of p-Akt compared to BEZ235 in PC3 and PC3-AR cell
lines. Phospho-Erk1/2 was not greatly reduced in PC3
cells by any treatment in contrast to combination treatment
of PC3-AR (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, levels of p-ATM were
initially increased by either PAN or BEZ235 treatment in
PC3 cells, but combination treatment maintained p-ATM
levels similar to that in untreated cells. Conversely,
PAN treatment of PC3-AR cells did not affect p-ATM
levels, and BEZ235 treatment resulted in reduction of
p-ATM levels. This reduction of p-ATM was enhanced
by combination treatment of PC3-AR cells (Fig. 4C).
Collectively, this data demonstrates the potential of PAN
combined with BEZ235 to maintain increased levels of
DNA damage while attenuating the DNA damage response
mediated through ATM-Akt-Erk1/2 signaling.
BEZ235 and PAN combined treatment of PC3
and PC3-AR produces greater antitumor activity. The
antitumor activity of BEZ235 and PAN was investigated in
vivo by treating male SCID mice bearing PC3 or PC3-AR
subcutaneous tumors. Tumor bearing mice were treated
with vehicle (N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)/PEG300,
1:9 v/v), PAN (10mg/kg i.p.: Mon-Wed-Fri), BEZ235
(25mg/kg i.p.: Mon-Fri) or combination. Treatment of

that was further enhanced by combination treatment

AR tumor proliferation (PC3, p=0.6; PC3-AR, p=0.01).
BEZ235/PAN combination treatment of PC3 tumors did
impair tumor proliferation further compared to BEZ235
single treatment, though did significantly reduce PC3
tumor proliferative capacity compared to PAN single
treatment (p<0.0001). However, combination treatment
of PC3-AR tumors resulted in dramatic reduction of
tumor proliferation compared to each single treatment
cohort (p<0.0001, combination vs. BEZ235; p<0.0001,
combination vs. PAN). These results indicate that
BEZ235/PAN combination treatment may provide a
therapeutic strategy for patients with advanced prostate
cancer independent of tumor AR status.
Combination with BEZ235 and PAN results in
increased DNA damage and reduced ATM expression in
PC3 and PC3-AR tumors. To assess the activity of BEZ235
and/or PAN on induction of DNA damage and inhibition
of ATM expression in vivo, we used immunostaining to
determine the expression of p-ɣH2AX and ATM. Fig.
6A shows that treatment of PC3 and PC3-AR tumors
with BEZ235 resulted in tumor specific effects, where
p-ɣH2AX levels were reduced in PC3 tumors (p=0.01) but
increased in PC3-AR (p=0.01) tumors compared to vehicle
treated tumors. As expected, PAN significantly increased
p-ɣH2AX levels in both tumors (PC3, p<0.0001; PC3AR, p=0.0003) compared to mice treated with vehicle.
Combination treatment also resulted in tumor specific
effects, as p-ɣH2AX was reduced to levels similar to
vehicle treatment, though in PC3-AR tumors, p-ɣH2AX
levels increased comparable to PAN single treated tumors.
Tissues were next assessed for p-ATM nuclear

expression by immunostaining. PC3 tumors treated with
BEZ235 alone resulted in a significant reduction of p-ATM
compared to vehicle treated tumors (p<0.0001), whereas
BEZ235 treatment of PC3-AR tumors did not significantly
change levels of p-ATM. No significant changes were
observed in either PC3 or PC3-AR tumors treated with
PAN when compared to vehicle. However, compared
to each single treatment, combination treatment in PC3
tumors significantly decreased p-ATM levels (p=0.006,
combination verse BEZ235; p<0.0001, combination vs.
PAN) and in PC3-AR tumors (p<0.0001, combination
vs. BEZ235; p=0.0001, combination vs. PAN) (Fig. 6B).
Collectively, these data indicate that greater anti-tumor
activity resulting from combination of BEZ235 and PAN
are associated with deregulation of the DNA damage-DNA
damage repair equilibrium.

DISCUSSION
Advances in drug development have resulted in
exciting changes to the therapeutic landscape for advanced
PCa. For several years, the primary treatment option of
CRPC has been limited to docetaxel chemotherapy,
which extends survival but for a limited time [39]. While
the treatment of advanced PCa has been extremely
challenging, novel therapeutic options have emerged.
The second line cabazitaxel [1], the immunotherapy
sipuluecel-T [2], the androgen synthesis inhibitor
abiraterone acetate [3] the AR antagonist enzalutamide
[4] and the alpha particle emitter radium-223 [5] have
all received recent FDA approval for the treatment
of advanced PCa. Although these new therapies have
expanded the treatments options for patients, sustainable
suppression of PCa growth still remains a primary
challenge and new treatment strategies are still required.
Apoptosis induced by HDAC inhibition has been
demonstrated to be dependent on AR expression [40].
Our study also demonstrates that PAN mediated apoptosis
is AR dependent. PC3 cells response to PAN treatment
was predominantly cell cycle arrest, whereas PC3AR cells were significantly more sensitive to HDACi
mediated apoptosis, as indicated by dramatic increases
of cell membrane permeability, caspase activation and
DNA fragmentation. The differential response to HDAC
inhibition maybe explained by significant increase in
DNA damage we observed in PC3-AR cells in response
to HDACi. Transcription factors including AR are
demonstrated to induce DNA damage via double strand
breaks (DSBs) to mediate their transcriptional programs.
These DSBs are recognized by DNA repair machinery
such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and
ATM. If not repaired properly, persistent DSBs can induce
apoptosis [41]. We and others have shown that HDACi can
mediate loss of AR transcriptional activity independent of
AR degradation [12, 42], suggesting that cessation of AR
transcription may also inhibit DNA damage repair, leading

BEZ235/panobinostat combination against PC3 and
PC3-AR tumor models. Combination treatment of BEZ235

with panobinostat maintains/increases DNA double strand breaks
as indicated by ɣ-H2AX. Further, combination treatment results
in a superior suppression of the DNA damage response pathway
mediated through ATM-Akt-Erk1/2. Overall, combination
therapy creates an imbalance between DNA damage and DNA
damage response generating greater therapeutic efficacy.

to greater cell catastrophe. This was further supported by
the loss of activated ATM in response to HDACi, which
would further abrogate DNA damage repair. ATM also
mediates part of its DNA repair mechanism through the
activation of Akt-Erk1/2 signaling [43]. Because the
PC3 model used in our studies exhibits constitutively
activated Akt via loss of the tumor suppressor gene Pten,
we proposed that suppression of Akt-Erk1/2 signaling
could be a critical axis underlying increased sensitivity to
HDACi mediated DSBs and apoptosis. Previously, HDACi
have been shown to attenuate activated levels of Akt and
Erk1/2 [44, 45]. However, in our studies, comparable
suppression of activated Akt and opposing effects of
activated Erk1/2 in response to HDACi suggested that an
imbalance in DSBs and ATM expression was critical for
HDACI mediated apoptosis.
The ability of HDACi to create imbalance between
DNA damage and DNA repair mechanisms was exciting,
though the modest effect on Akt and Erk1/2 signaling
suggested potential escape mechanisms which could be
therapeutically exploited to enhance anti-tumor efficacy.
Recently, the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 has
been reported to exhibit potent in vivo anti-tumor activity
via inhibition of Akt and both mTOR signaling complexes.
Further, BEZ235 has also been shown to possess inhibitory
action towards DNA damage response proteins DNA-PK
and ATM in multiple tumor models [35, 36, 44, 46]. Here,
combination of BEZ235 with PAN sustained DNA damage
while abrogating activated ATM, Akt and Erk1/2 in vitro.
Therefore, combining PAN with BEZ235 maintained the
imbalance between DNA damage and DNA damage repair
while simultaneously inhibiting Akt and Erk1/2 signaling,
promoting greater accumulation of apoptotic cells.
The combination of PAN and BEZ235 in vivo
showed significant attenuation of tumor growth in PC3
and PC3-AR tumors compared to single agent treatments,
which was associated with pronounced loss of tumor
proliferation. Combination treatment of PC3 tumors
resulted in sustained DNA damage compared with vehicle
treated tumors. However this level of DNA damage was
less than that observed in PAN single treated tumors.
This may be explained by the partial attenuation of DNA
damage by BEZ235 single treatment. Moreover, PC3AR tumors displayed increased DNA damage following
combination treatment, comparable to PAN single
treatment, and greater than vehicle and BEZ235 treated
tumors. Most excitingly, in both tumor models, significant
attenuation of the DNA damage response protein ATM
occurred with combination therapy compared to single
treatments. This is an important finding as it demonstrates
the ability of this combination therapy to mediate
therapeutic efficacy independent of tumor AR status.
The drug development of HDACi as single
agents for the treatment of solid tumors, including
prostate cancer, has been disappointing. Rational
combination strategies that exploit the transcriptional
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and prostranslational modifications induced by HDACi
should be clinically tested based on convincing preclinical
data and robust co-clinical trials. Optimal dosing and
schedule of administration should be based on the
molecular mechanism targeted by the HDACi. Induction
of apoptosis may require relatively high doses given in
a pulsed fashion. Interestingly, the required in vivo dose
capable of inducing a biological effect in the PC3 model
was relatively low. Further molecular studies will help
to dissect the genome and epigenome signature for this
susceptibility and will provide the potential predictors of
response in patients with PCa.
In conclusion, targeting advanced prostate cancer
largely involves inhibitors towards androgen synthesis
and androgen receptor transactivation. Together, our
data provides rationale for the clinical translation of
PAN combined with BEZ235 for treatment of advanced
prostate cancer, independent of AR status. While targeting
the DNA damage/DNA repair axis has been a goal of
chemotherapy intervention, toxicity has made this strategy
difficult to manage clinically. Both PAN and BEZ235
have returned favorable toxicity profiles in cancer patients
and results from our study demonstrate that combination
therapy sustains or increases intratumoral DNA damage
while attenuating DNA damage repair (decreased ATM)
and survival pathway (activated Akt and Erk1/2) signaling
independent of AR status (Fig. 7). The optimal clinical
setting to test this combination strategy remains to be
determined but the molecular mechanism highlighted in
this study suggests several potential rational combination
strategies both pre and post docetaxel treatment. Overall,
these data highlight the necessity of this therapeutic
strategy to be further clinically developed to treat patients
with advanced prostate cancer.

Cell culture and Reagents.
PC-3 cells were purchased from ATCC and PC3-AR
[47] expressing cells were a kind gift from Dr. John Isaacs
(John Hopkins University). All cell lines were cultured in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37, 5% CO2.
Primary antibodies used were GAPDH (#5174), p-Akt
(Ser473, #4060), Akt (#9272), p-Erk1/2 (#4370), Erk1/2
(9102), p-ɣH2AX (Ser139, #9718), p-4EBP1 (#9451),
4EBP1 (9644), p-S6K (#2211), S6K (#2217) all from cell
signaling, Ki67 (RM-9106, thermo scientific) and p-ATM
(Ser1981; #2151-1, epitomics).

Immunohistochemistry.

One million cells (1x105) were seeded in a 6-well
plate (BD Bioscience) overnight to adhere. Cells were
then incubated in the presence of indicated treatments
for 24 and 48 hours. Following treatment, adherent and
non-adherent cells were collected and washed in 1x PBS
and stained by 500ng/ml of propidium iodide (PI) for 5
minutes. FACS Caliber cytometer was used to analyze PI
uptake.

Mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation at
defined time points. Tumor tissue was fixed in 10%
buffered formalin overnight followed by an additional
24 hours in 70% ethanol. For antigen retrieval, slides
were boiled for 10 minutes in 10mM sodium citrate pH
6 solution for all antibodies. ImmPRESSTM detection
system (Vector Laboratories) was used for detection of
all primary antibodies. Staining was visualized using
3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Sigma, Saint Louis,
MO, FAST 3,3′-Diamino benzidine) and slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin. For quantitation of IHC
staining representative images (3-6) were obtained using
a Zeiss light microscope (Zeiss). Positive nuclear staining
was quantified by Aperio ImageScope (v11.1.2.760).

Cell cycle analysis.
One million cells (1x105) were seeded in a 6-well
plate (BD Bioscience) overnight to adhere and treated
as indicated. Following treatments, adherent and nonadherent cells were collected and washed in 1x PBS, and
fixed in 50% ethanol at 4ºC overnight. Cells were then
stained with PI solution containing RNase A (Sigma) for
15 minutes at 37ºC. DNA content analysis was performed
by a FACS caliber cytometer.

In vivo animal studies.
The Institute Animal Care and Use Committee
at Roswell Park Cancer Institute approved all mouse
protocols used in this study. Mice were housed in
an animal facility maintained on a 12-h light/dark
cycle, at a constant temperature (22±2°C) and relative
humidity (55±15%). Tap water and food were available
ad libitum. Five million (5x106) PC3 or PC3-AR cells
were subcutaneously injected into intact male SCID
mice. Treatment was initiated when tumor size reached
~50mm2, mice were randomized to four treatment groups:
(1) Vehicle (N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)/PEG300, 1:9
v/v: Mon-Fri, oral gavage), (2) BEZ235 25mg/kg (MonFri, oral gavage), (3) PAN 10mg/kg (Mon-Wed-Fri, i.p.),
(4) combination. Mice were weighed weekly to monitor
for toxicity and tumor growth was assessed by serial
caliper measurements twice weekly.

Western blot analysis.
Cells (1x105) were typsinized, washed with 1x
PBS, and resuspended in 100ul RIPA buffer (Sigma)
supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail then
incubated on ice for 40 minutes. After centrifugation,
the protein concentration was quantified using Bradford
Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Fifty micrograms (50µg)
of total cell lysates were separated using 4-15% SDSPAGE gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes
(Bio-Rad) were blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 hour
at room temperature, and then incubated with indicated
primary antibodies for overnight. Anti-rabbit horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad)
was used. Immunoblots were developed by enhanced
chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer).

Statistical Analysis.
Data are displayed as the mean ± SE. Differences
were determined using one or two-way ANOVA and
two-tailed paired t tests where indicated, using GraphPad
Prism software. P values less than 0.05 were assigned
statistically significant.

Assessment of apoptosis.
One million (1x105) PC-3 and PC3-AR cells were
seeded in 6-well plates overnight to adhere. Cells were
treated with PAN or BEZ235 for 24 and 48 hours. After
treatment, cells were collected, washed with 1x PBS, and
incubated with annexin:1x annexin binding buffer (1:100)
(BD Bioscience) for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Annexin positive cells were detected using a FACS caliber
cytometer.
