ABSTRACT
Chemoresistance is one of the causes of poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer
patients. However, the mechanisms of resistance remain unclear. Here we screened
miRNAs associated with drug resistance in pancreatic cancer, and identified a
panel of miRNAs dysregulated in gemcitabine-resistance pancreatic cancer cells,
including 13 downregulated miRNAs and 20 upregulated miRNAs. Further studies
focusing on miR-497 demonstrated that miR-497 suppressed cells proliferation,
decreased the percentage of S phase cells, re-sensitized cells to gemcitabine and
erlotinib, and attenuated migration and invasion capacities. Furthermore, fibroblast
growth factor 2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 were confirmed as miR-497
targets. Overexpression of miR-497 inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Additionally,
miR-497 expression was significantly downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues
compared with tumor-adjacent samples (P=0.000). Low expression of miR-497 was
an independent adverse prognostic factor of pancreatic cancer (P=0.01, hazard
ratio=2.762, 95% confidence interval: 1.159–6.579). Together these results indicate
that miR-497 could be a new therapeutic target and prognostic marker of pancreatic
cancer.

INTRODUCTION

the mechanisms of drug resistance and re-sensitizing
pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapy are essential
measures for improving survival.
MiRNAs are involved in the regulation of
carcinogenesis and drug resistance as oncogenes or
tumor suppressors [5, 6]. Many studies have reported
roles for miRNAs in the regulation of the progression of
pancreatic cancer, including in tumor growth, metastasis
and chemoresistance [7]. However, most studies only
investigated a select panel of miRNAs. The profile of
miRNAs associated with drug resistance in pancreatic
cancer has not yet been identified.
The current study screened miRNAs associated
with drug resistance in pancreatic cancer and identified a
panel of miRNAs dysregulated in drug-resistant pancreatic

Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease, with a 5-year
survival rate of less than 5% [1]. One of the reasons
underlying poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer is drug
resistance. Gemcitabine is a first line chemotherapeutic
agent that is widely used for treatment of advanced
pancreatic cancer. However, only 9.4% of patients with
metastatic pancreatic cancers achieve partial response,
and 34.5% show a progressive disease during the
chemotherapy [2]. Newer therapeutic regimens and
some targeted therapies, such as epidermal growth
factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, are superior
to conventional regimens, but the overall survival
is still unsatisfactory [3, 4]. Therefore, determining

miR-497 in pancreatic cancer cells and the expression
levels of miR-497 in pancreatic cancer tissues and
evaluated prognostic values.

miRNAs and 20 upregulated miRNAs (Figure 1A).
Among these miRNAs, miR-497 was chosen for further
investigation based on the following reasons. First, miR497 showed the largest change in expression level in
SW1990/GEM cells (0.00794-fold change). Quantitative
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
further showed that the expression level of miR-497 in
SW1990/GEM cells was significantly downregulated
(Figure 1B). Second, miR-497 was previously reported to
be involved in regulating chemosensitivity in colorectal
cancer [8].

RESULTS

To identify miRNAs associated with drug resistance
in pancreatic cancer, we screened the miRNA expression
profile in parental SW1990 and gemcitabine-resistant
SW1990 (SW1990/GEM) cells using Illumina miRNA
arrays. The criteria for identification of miRNAs
associated with drug resistance were fold change > 4 or <
0.25 and P < 0.05 (Student t tests). A total of 33 miRNAs
out of 1146 miRNAs probes in the Illumina microarray
platform were identified, including 13 downregulated

We first confirmed the expression levels of miR497 after transfection of mimics or inhibitor in SW1990
cells. As expected, miR-497 levels were significantly
upregulated or downregulated after transfection of mimics
or inhibitor, respectively (Figure S1).

CCK-8 assays were performed to assess the effects
of miR-497 mimics or inhibitor on the proliferation of
SW1990 and MiaPaCa-2 PDAC cells. We observed
a significantly decreased growth rate in miR-497
upregulated cells compared with control cells in both
PDAC cell lines (Figure 2A). In addition, downregulation
of miR-497 by inhibitor promoted the proliferation of both
PDAC cell lines (Figure 2A).

while decreased sensitivity to erlotinib was observed in
cells downregulated for miR-497 (Figure 2C).

MiR-497 induced cell cycle arrest in PDAC cell
lines
We also evaluated the effect of miR-497 levels on
cell cycle. Compared with the control group, upregulation
of miR-497 in PDAC cells by transfection with mimics
significantly decreased the percentage of cells in S
phase (Figure 3), whereas knockdown of miR-497 by
transfection inhibitors increased the percentage of S phase
cells (Figure 3).

MiR-497 re-sensitized PDAC cells to gemcitabine
and erlotinib
We next examined the effects of miR-497 levels
on chemosensitivity of PDAC cells to gemcitabine and
erlotinib. Upregulation of miR-497 in SW1990 and
MiaPaCa-2 cells by transfection with mimics significantly
increased the inhibitory effects of gemcitabine treatment
compared with cells transfected with mimics control
(Figure 2B). In contrast, PDAC cells transfected with
inhibitor were more resistant to gemcitabine compared
with cells transfected with inhibitor control (Figure 2B).
Consistent with these results, upregulation of miR-497
increased PDAC cell sensitivity to erlotinib (Figure 2C),

MiR-497 attenuated the migration and invasion
capacities
Transwell assays were performed to examine the
contribution of miR-497 to cell migration and invasion
in PDAC cell lines. We observed that upregulation of
miR-497 in both PDAC cell lines resulted in reduced cell
migration and invasion abilities (Figure 4A). In contrast,

reduction of miR-497 levels enhanced cell migration and
invasion (Figure 4B).

We next established an in vivo model to determine
the role of miR-497 on tumor growth in mice. SW1990
cells stably overexpressing miR-497 or control cells were
transplanted into mice, and tumor growth was monitored.
Tumor size in mice transplanted with SW1990 cells stably
overexpressing miR-497 was significantly smaller than
those from control mice (P=0.000) (Figure 5).

Identification of miR-497 targets
To identify potential targets of miR-497,
we performed target prediction analysis using the
bioinformatics database (TargetScan; http://www.
targetscan.org/). Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and
fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) were both
identified as potential targets of miR-497.
We performed dual luciferase reporter assays for
further verification. We generated luciferase reporter
constructs containing either the wild-type or mutated
binding sequences in FGF2 or FGFR1 downstream of
the firefly luciferase gene. 293A cells were co-transfected
with reporter vectors and mimics or mimic control, and
luciferase activities were evaluated. Luciferase activities
were significantly decreased after co-transfection of miR497 mimics with vectors containing FGF2 and FGFR1
wild-type binding site sequences compared with cells

Mice were transplanted with SW1990 cells stably overexpressing

Figure 6: MiR-497 directly inhibited the expression of FGF2 and FGFR1 by binding to the 3′-UTR. (A) Dual luciferase

assay showed that FGF2 and FGFR1 were direct targets of miR-497. Cells were transfected with luciferase vectors containing either the
wild-type or mutated binding site for miR-497 in FGF2 (left) or FGFR1 (right). The relative luciferase activity of cells co-transfected with
vectors containing wild-type binding sequences along with miR-497 mimics was significantly decreased compared with that of cells cotransfected with mutated binding sequence vectors and mimics. Luciferase activities were also reduced compared with cells transfected
with vectors containing wild-typed binding sequences and mimics control, as well as cells with mutant binding sequence vectors and
mimics control. Data are displayed as the mean ± SD (*P < 0.05). (B) Protein expression levels of FGF2 and FGFR1 were detected by
western blot.

mutated binding site sequence. Luciferase activities were
also reduced compared with cells transfected with vectors
containing wild-type binding sequences and mimics
control, as well as cells with mutant binding sequence
vectors and mimics control. (Figure 6A). These results
suggest that FGF2 and FGFR1 are direct targets of miR497.
To further confirm that FGF2 and FGFR1 are
targets of miR-497, we performed western blot analysis.
Upregulation of miR-497 significantly attenuated the
expression of both FGF2 and FGFR1 protein levels, while

inhibition of miR-497 increased the protein levels of
FGF2 and FGFR1 (Figure 6B). Notably, upregulation of
miR-497 had no effect on the mRNA levels of FGF2 and
FGFR1 in SW1990 cells (Figure S2).

ISH staining revealed that miR-497 was located in the
cytoplasm (Figure 7A). Tissue samples were scored
for high and low miR-497 expression, as described
in Materials and Methods. Among the 90 pancreatic
cancer samples, 69 showed low expression of miR-497
and 21 showed high expression. In comparison, among
the matched tumor-adjacent tissues, only eight showed
low expression of miR-497, whereas 82 showed high
expression. The expression of miR-497 in pancreatic
cancer tissues was significantly decreased compared with
that in tumor-adjacent tissues (P=0.000) (Figure 7B).

respectively).

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic cancer is a fatal disease, and difficulty in
early detection and low resection rate may partly explain
the poor prognosis. Another significant cause underlying
poor prognosis is drug resistance. Thus, screening
effective biomarkers, identification of the mechanisms of
drug resistance and re-sensitizing pancreatic cancer cells
to drugs are important strategies for improving overall
survival. In the current study, we screened the miRNA
profile associated with drug resistance in gemcitabineresistant SW1990 pancreatic cancer cell lines, and
identified 13 downregulated miRNAs and 20 upregulated
miRNAs, including miR-497. We also found that miR497 played important roles in regulating malignant
phenotypes and drug resistance. In addition, we showed
that the expression levels of miR-497 were significantly
decreased in pancreatic cancer tissues and associated with
a poor prognosis.
Previous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs
are involved in chemoresistance to gemcitabine treatment
in pancreatic cancer. However, most studies only focused
on selected miRNAs [6, 9]. Only one study, performed
by Iwagami et al., screened miRNAs associated with
gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer [10]. To
well define the miRNAs associated with drug resistance,
we screened the profile of miRNAs associated with
drug resistance and identified 33 miRNAs that were

MiR-497 low expression was associated with a
poor prognosis
We also assessed the correlation between miR-497
levels and clinicopathological parameters and prognosis.
Three cases were lost to follow-up, and the statistical
analysis was based on the remaining 87 cases. The mean
follow-up was 26.9 months (range 1–87 months).
No correlation between the levels of miR-497
and clinicopathological parameters was observed (Table
S1). Univariate survival analysis indicated that TNM
staging and miR-497 expression levels were the potential
prognostic factors of pancreatic cancer (Table 1, Figure
7C). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that TNM
staging (II/III/IV) and miR-497 expression (low) were
the independent adverse prognostic factors (P=0.016,
hazard ratio [HR]=1.965, 95% confidence interval [CI]:
1.130–3.416, P=0.01, HR=2.762, 95%CI: 1.159–6.579,

dysregulated in gemcitabine-resistant SW1990 cell lines.
Surprisingly, miRNAs identified in the present study
were not identified in the report by Iwagami et al. [10].
Possible explanations include different cell lines used
for experimental analysis and different selection criteria
between these two studies.
Among the 33 miRNAs, we selected miR-497
for further study. We found that miR-497 suppressed
proliferation, decreased the percentage of S phase cells,
increased sensitivity to gemcitabine, and attenuated
migration and invasion capacities, which was consistent
with results from previous studies [8, 11]. Furthermore, we
demonstrated for the first time that miR-497 increased the
sensitivity of PDAC cells to erlotinib. Database prediction
analysis identified potential targets of miR-497, including
FGF2 and FGFR1. Dual luciferase reporter assays and
western blot confirmed FGF2 and FGFR1 as direct targets
of miR-497. Several members of the miR-15abc/16/16a
bc/195/322/424/497/1907 cluster had been identified to
be involved in regulating the expression of FGF2 and
FGFR1. MiR-15 and miR-16 were shown to inhibit the
levels of FGF2 and FGFR1 protein by binding to the 3′UTR [12]. However, our study provides the first findings
indicating miR-497 regulation of FGF2 and FGFR1.
The FGF/FGFR signaling pathway is involved
in multiple processes in cancer development. FGF/
FGFR signaling activates several downstream signaling
pathways, including the mitogen activated protein kinase
and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT pathways [13,
14], which promote proliferation and metastasis and
induce drug resistance and cell cycle progression.[15]
Furthermore, activation of the AKT pathway results in
acquired resistance to erlotinib treatment [16].
In addition, we found that the expression of miR497 was significantly decreased in pancreatic cancer
tissues. Our study further confirmed the results reported
by previous studies [8, 17]. Survival analysis indicated
that low miR-497 expression was an independent poor
prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer patients. Similar
results were reported in a study by Luo and colleagues
demonstrating that low miR-497 expression appeared to
be a poor prognostic factor in cervical cancer [17].

METHODS

CONCLUSION

Total RNA was extracted from SW1990 and
SW1990/GEM PDAC cells using TRIzol RNA isolation
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The Illumina Human miRNA
Expression Profiling Version 2 Panels containing 1146
assays were used to screen the miRNA profile associated
with chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer. Total RNA
(200 ng) was polyadenylated by poly(A) polymerase
and then reverse transcribed with biotinylated oligodeoxythymidine primer with a universal PCR sequence
at its 5′ end. The biotinylated cDNA was annealed to
chimeric query oligonucleotides that included miRNAspecific oligos and a universal primer sequence for PCR

involving animals and patients were approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of Peking Union Medical
College Hospital. Animal experiments were performed
according to the guidelines of the Experimental Animals
Management Committee. Written informed consent was
obtained from all subjects.

Cell lines and culture
SW1990 and MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells (a gift from Professor
Helmut Freiss of Heidelberg University, Germany) were
cultured in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C
in RPMI-1640 medium or Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, Hyclone, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Waltham, MA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Hyclone). 293A cell line is purchased from Cell Resource
Center, IBMS, CAMS/PUMC, and cultured in DMEM
containing 10% FBS. The gemcitabine resistant cell line,
SW1990/GEM, was generated by intermittently increasing
drug concentration. The initial concentration was the half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50, 9 μg/ml). The
drug concentration increased exponentially up to 1000
μg/ml over a period of 9 months. The IC50 of SW1900/
GEM cells was 4560 μg/ml. Gemcitabine (750 ng/ml)
was included in the medium to maintain the resistant
phenotype and removed 1 month before experimental use
of the cells.

Illumina miRNA arrays

The current study screened the miRNA profile
associated with drug resistance in pancreatic cancer
and identified a panel of miRNAs potentially involved
in chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells. We
demonstrated that miR-497 plays a role in modulating the
malignant phenotype and chemosensitivity of pancreatic
cancer cells by directly inhibition of FGF2 and FGFR1
expression. The expression levels of miR-497 were
positively associated with overall survival, indicating that
miR-497 could serve as a new prognostic biomarker in
pancreatic cancer.

miR-497 in tissues. For ISH, slides were incubated at
37°C for 30 min. After slides were deparaffinized in
xylene and rehydrated with graded alcohol washes, the
slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and
then washed in PBS three times. The slides were then
incubated with 15 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at room

were pre-hybridized in hybridization buffer for 1 h at 50°C
and then hybridized in the hybridization buffer containing
probe overnight at 4°C. The following day, slides were
washed stringently at 50°C for 20 min and then blocked in
a blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Finally,
slides were placed in blocking solution containing alkaline
phosphatase conjugated anti-DIG Fab fragment overnight
at 4°C. The colorimetric detection reaction was carried
out using the NBT/BCIP kit (ThermoFisher Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s introductions.
Slides were scored according to the staining intensity
and number of positive cells. Scoring for staining intensity
was as follows: none (0 point), weak staining (1 points),
intermediate staining (2 points), and strong staining (3
points). Scoring for the percentage of positive cells was as
follows: absent (0 point), 1–24% positive cells (1 point),
25–49% (2 points), 50–74% (3 points), and 75–100% (4
points). The final score was calculated by multiplication of
the above two scores. MiR-497 expression was considered
to be low if the final score was less than 4 points, and high
if the final score was 4 or more points [18].
Follow-up data were obtained from hospital records
supplemented with telephone contact. The end point was
overall survival. Survival time was defined according to
the date of death or as the time between the last follow-up
date and the operation date.

Transwell assay
Cell migration and invasion were assessed by
transwell assay. Cell migration was analyzed by transwell
membranes without Matrigel. Invasion was analyzed by
transwell membranes with Matrigel. Transfected cells
were seeded in medium without FBS in the upper chamber
of a transwell system (polycarbonate membrane, diameter
6.5 mm, pore size 8 μm; Corning Costar, USA). Media
with 10% FBS was added into the bottom chamber. After
24–48 h incubation (SW1990: 24 h; MiaPaCa-2: 48 h),
migrated or invading cells were fixed with formalin and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Zhong Shan Golden
Bridge Company, Beijing, China). Cell numbers were
counted under a microscope at 100× magnification in five
random visual fields. Experiments were performed three
times.

Animal experiments
SW1990 PDAC cells stably transfected with miR497-lentiviral vectors or control lentiviral vectors were
injected subcutaneously into the right back of 6-weekold female BALB/c mice (3×106 cells in 200 μl PBS per
mouse). Each experimental group included five mice.
Tumor size was measured twice a week using caliper
measurement of two perpendicular diameters of the
implants. Tumor volume (mm3) was calculated based on
the formula: volume (mm3) = 1/2 × length × width2. The
tumor-bearing mice were euthanized on the 30th day.

Luciferase reporter assays
The pmirGLO dual luciferase miRNA target
expression vector (Promega, E1330) was used to assess
miR-497 regulation of putative miRNA target sites. Wildtype or mutant miR-497 binding site sequences in FGF2
and FGFR1 were synthesized by Invitrogen and cloned
into pmirGLO vectors 3′ of the firefly luciferase gene.
Vectors were named as wild-type and mutated vectors.
Vectors and miR-497 mimics or mimic control were
co-transfected in 293A cells in 12-well plates (1×105
cells/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. After 48
h, luciferase activities were evaluated using the DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s guidelines. Renilla luciferase (hRlucneo) served as the control reporter for normalization.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis and graph presentation were
performed using SPSS v.13.0 software (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL) and GraphPad Prism 5 Software (GraphPad,
San Diego, CA), respectively. Measurement data were
presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and
compared by Student’s t test or the Mann-Whitney U
test. Categorical data were compared by Pearson χ2 test
or Fisher exact test. The Kaplan–Meier method and Cox
regression were used for univariate and multivariate
