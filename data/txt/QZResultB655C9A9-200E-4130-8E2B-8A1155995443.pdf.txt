Abstract
Cell line-derived xenografts (CDXs) are an integral part of drug efficacy testing
during development of new pharmaceuticals against cancer but their accuracy in
predicting clinical responses in patients have been debated. Patient-derived xenografts
(PDXs) are thought to be more useful for predictive biomarker identification for
targeted therapies, including in metastatic melanoma, due to their similarities to
human disease. Here, tumor biopsies from fifteen patients and ten widely-used
melanoma cell lines were transplanted into immunocompromised mice to generate
PDXs and CDXs, respectively. Gene expression profiles generated from the tumors
of these PDXs and CDXs clustered into distinct groups, despite similar mutational
signatures. Hypoxia-induced gene signatures and overexpression of the hypoxiaregulated miRNA hsa-miR-210 characterized CDXs. Inhibition of hsa-miR-210 with
decoys had little phenotypic effect in vitro but reduced sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition
in vivo, suggesting down-regulation of this miRNA could result in development of
resistance to MEK inhibitors.

Introduction

of the molecular pathways that govern disease progression
and therapeutic resistance is needed to improve clinical
outcomes.
Traditional 2-D cell cultures are longstanding and
effective models used in basic cancer research. However,
cell lines grown in continuous culture adapt to culture
conditions, which could contribute to false positive
responses to small molecule inhibition in vitro and in vivo
[9, 10]. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are
thought to better recapitulate the disease [11, 12]. There
is even evidence that drug screens in PDXs could be
used to predict treatment responses in patients [13–15].
With advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS)
techniques and decreasing prices, it is now accessible to
couple these analyses to drug response in PDX models.
This makes biomarker discovery possible prior or parallel
to clinical trials [16, 17]. The limitation of using PDXs

Malignant melanoma arises via stepwise
transformation of melanocytes and is highly aggressive
when metastatic. Early stage melanomas are often curable
by resection, but prognosis and overall survival for
patients with advanced-stage malignant melanoma remain
poor [1, 2]. The majority of melanomas carry mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway-activating
mutations, especially in BRAF, NRAS, NF1 [3, 4];
providing avenues for targeted therapeutic intervention.
Although clinical responses to targeted therapies are often
initially good, most patients eventually develop acquired
therapeutic resistance [5]. Likewise, disease-free survival
is improved by combination regimens with small molecule
inhibitors [6] and/or immunotherapy [7, 8], but most
patients succumb to lethal disease. A better understanding

Differential regulation of miRNAs between
PDXs and CDXs

is that these models are not as tractable for genetic and
pharmacological high-throughput screens as cultured cells.
Hence, cultured cells will continue to contribute to cancer
discoveries [18].
The aim of this study was to investigate if gene
expression profiles (GEPs) of some widely used metastatic
melanoma cell lines could be used to stratify different
patient’s PDXs - if only the cell lines were grown in
mice prior to expression profiling. If this in vivo-GEPnormalization would materialize, screening data generated
in the cell line in vitro could point to which PDX model
to use for accurate in vivo validation. Instead, our data
suggest GEPs from PDXs and CDXs are different, which
could be due to a differential regulation of the hypoxic
response.

Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small ~21 nucleotide
sequences that post-transcriptionally or posttranslationally regulate gene expression. It is estimated
that at least 30% of all protein-coding genes are regulated
by miRNAs in mammals [19] and miRNA regulation is
indispensable for mammalian development. miRNAs
are known to be dysregulated in cancer and a number
of miRNAs have been investigated for their role in
melanoma development or therapeutic resistance [20].
Given the clear transcriptome-wide differences between
PDXs and CDXs, we next investigated the role of
miRNAs by assessing the expression of their host gene
mRNAs. Due to their overall low levels of expression,
raw reads counts were first extracted from the dataset
using “MIR” as the identifier for subsequent differential
expression analysis. As with the whole transcriptome
data, there were clear differences in miRNA host gene
expression between PDXs and CDXs (Figure 2A and
Supplementary Table S3). The most significantly altered
miRNA host gene between PDXs and CDXs were hsamiR-210HG and hsa-miR-600HG (Figure 2A–2B and
Supplementary Table S3). Moreover, principal component
analysis (PCA) (Figure 2C) also revealed differences
between PDXs and CDXs, albeit less pronounced than
the PCA using the entire transcriptome (Figure 1B). hsamiR-210HG is a non-protein coding transcript encoding
the intronic miRNA hsa-miR-210 whereas no publications
or database predictions of function exist for hsa-miR600HG. Moreover, hsa-miR-210HG contains a hypoxia
inducible factor (HIF) response element (HRE), and the
non-protein coding transcript is processed to form the
mature hsa-miR-210 [21, 22]. Intrigued by the hypoxia
regulation, we performed Pearson correlation analysis to
identify genes correlating with hsa-mir-210HG. Many
of the top 40 genes (marked with an arrow) correlating
with hsa-miR210HG expression were either known HIF1
targets and/or involved in glycolysis, as predicted by
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Figure 2D and
Supplementary Table S5). It is thus tempting to speculate
that a major difference in transcriptomes between PDXs
and CDXs is due to the acclimatization to in vitro culture
conditions (e.g. 20 % oxygen) of the cell lines. When they
are then transplanted to mice and experience physiological
oxygen tension [23] the cells trigger a pseudo-hypoxic
response.

Results
Transcriptome-wide differences between CDXs and
PDXs with similar somatic mutations
To overcome the problem associated with culture
effects on gene expression, we created cell line-derived
xenografts (CDXs) by transplanting ten widely used
metastatic melanoma cell lines into NOD/Shi-scid/IL2Rγnull (NOG) immunodeficient mice. The CDXs and
previously described PDXs and patient tumor biopsies
[13] were then analyzed by RNAseq for mutation and
transcriptome analyses using poly(A) enrichment. The
selected cell line’s mutations represented melanoma - eight
CDX samples originated from BRAF mutant melanoma,
SK-MEL-2 harbored an activating Q61R NRAS mutation
and MeWo carried multiple NF1 inactivating mutations
(Figure 1A and Supplementary Table S1). TP53 was
mutated in SK-MEL-28 (L145R), SK-MEL-2 (G245S)
and in two of the PDXs (Supplementary Table S1). Three
PDXs harbored no mutations in BRAF, NRAS or NF1.
To assess if the transcriptome of cell lines would
be similar to that of PDX or patient biopsies (primary
patient biopsies = PR) when cell lines were grown in
mice, we performed principle component analysis and
sample distance matrix of the transcriptomes of all
samples. These analyses revealed that PDX and PR
exhibited similar transcriptomes but cell lines appeared
different (Figure 1B). This was not due to sample
variation since appropriate clustering of the biological
duplicates of CDXs and the matching primary or serially
transplanted PDX samples was observed (Figure 1C).
Notably, the main clusters were not mixed with samples
of PDX, biopsies of patient’s tumors (PR) and CDX.
Instead, PDX and PR were mostly inter-mixed and
separate from CDX.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the top-8000
expressed genes in all samples (Supplementary Figure
S1A) also show the apparent difference between the
transcriptomes of CDX and PDX/PR. It thus appears that
PDX and PR are more similar to each other than to CDX.

hypoxia was most likely the driver of expression differences
between the PDXs and CDXs, we next investigated the role

of hsa-miR-210 in the hypoxia-induced phenotype. Three
cell lines (A375, MML-1, and SK-MEL-2) were chosen for
further experiments, since they had the highest, intermediate,
and lowest hsa-miR-210HG read counts in the RNAseq
data (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table S4), respectively.
Subjecting the cell lines to reduced oxygen levels (5%) for
24 hours induced hsa-miR-210HG expression compared to
their respective controls grown in 20% oxygen (Figure 3A).
qRT-PCR of selected genes (Supplementary Figure S2)
confirmed induction of gene expression in response to
hypoxia (Figure 2D, marked with arrow).
We next examined expression of proteins involved
in the response of cells to hypoxia. These included
phosphorylated RB (p-RB; S780) [24] and geminin [25]
as markers of G1 and S-G2M phase of cell cycle, and
carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9) which is the most well
established target of hypoxia. As expected, p-RB was
reduced but so was total RB in MML-1 and SK-MEL-2.
One of many possible explanations for reduced total RB
could be reduced cap-dependent translation in response
to hypoxia [26]. Indeed phosphorylated translation factor
4E-BP1 [27], a marker of cap-dependent translation, was
reduced. Contrary to expectation, we did not observe an
up-regulation of CA9 in either MML-1 or SK-MEL-2 cell
lines grown in 5% oxygen conditions, despite increase
in mRNA levels. There was however an increase in a
slower migrating band in A375 cells; the cell line with
the strongest induction of CA9 mRNA (Figure 3C and
Supplementary Figure S2). On the other hand, A375 did
not induce the mRNA of many of the other HIF target
genes (Supplementary Figure S2), at variance with MML-1
and SK-MEL-2. Taken together these data showed that
different cell lines respond differently to lower oxygen
and that high hsa-miR-210HG expression correlate with a
blocked hypoxia response (except for CA9).
To further investigate the role of hsa-miR-210
in this setting, all the three cells lines were genetically
engineered with hsa-miR-210 decoy and subjected to
5% oxygen. Decoys were chosen because they provide
prolonged suppression of endogenous miRNA activity
compared to hairpin-based RNA inhibition systems
[28]. hsa-miR-210HG induction by low oxygen was not
hindered by expression of decoy but there the induction
of hsa-miR-210HG was stronger in SK-MEL-2, similar in
MML-1, and reduced in A375 cells as compared with the
same cell lines without the decoy, respectively (Figure 3A
and 3B). MML-1 and SK-MEL-2 cells engineered with
the miR decoy did not down-regulate the expression of
RB and CA9 or loose phosphorylation of 4EBP1 when
cultured at 5 % oxygen (Figure 3C), suggesting hypoxia
response was impaired when these cells were expressing
miR decoy. On the hand, some of the hypoxia induced
genes such as BNIP3, ENO2 and SLC16A3 were more
robustly induced by 5 % oxygen in SK-MEL-2 and
MML-1 cells expressing decoy, whereas some genes like
CA9 were less induced (compare Supplementary Figures
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

S2 and S3). It thus appears as if the hypoxia-regulation
of translation is impaired but not all of the hypoxic
transcriptional regulation in these cell lines. Contrary,
A375 cells, were still able to induce a slower migrating
form of CA9 when expressing miR decoy (Figures 3C) but
the expression levels of the HIF target genes was altered in
a similar way as in MML-1 and SK-MEL-2 cells (compare
Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Taken together, these
data indicate that the behavior of cells when exposed
to low oxygen vary depending on levels of basal hsamiR-210 expression.

Loss of hsa-miR-210 function with a miR decoy
renders MML-1 cells less sensitive to MEK
inhibition (GSK1120212, trametinib) in vivo and
accelerates tumor progression
Our RNAseq data were generated from melanoma
cells grown in mice. Next, we therefore injected MML-1
cells or MML-1 cells engineered with the hsa-miR-210
decoy subcutaneously into the flanks of NOG mice.
Decoy expressing MML-1 cells grew more rapidly than
ordinary MML-1 cells (Figure 3D) and reached the ethics
limit requiring their sacrifice earlier (Figure 3E). To
investigate if inhibition of hsa-miR-210 would impact
the cells response to targeted therapies, we treated mice
with MEK inhibitor trametinib, since this is an approved
treatment against BRAF mutated melanoma [29]. As
expected, trametinib prolonged life of MML-1 CDXs
(Figure 3E). Again, in spite of treatment, mice carrying
decoy-engineered MML-1 cells reach the ethics limit for
sacrifice significantly faster than mice carrying ordinary
MML-1 cells.
To investigate the underlying cause of the relative
insensitivity of MML-1 cells expressing decoy, a
Reactome Pathway Database map of potential hsamiR-210 (Supplementary Figure S1B) targets was
investigated. Interestingly, both ERK1/2 and AKT,
proteins whose induction could bypass MEK inhibition
were among the putative targets. Therefore, western
blot analysis was performed on protein extracts from
tumors arising from MML-1 wild type controls or decoyengineered cells. There were no marked differences in total
or phosphorylated ERK1/2 between the groups, but 3/5
decoy-engineered tumors had increased phosphorylated
AKT levels as compared to tumors developed from the
parental cell line (Figure 3F).

Discussion
Cell lines have been used for many decades to
study cancer biology and they are believed to capture the
genetic variation of human cancer [18]. Moreover, they
are generally useful for drug screenings and for genetic
high-throughput screening using e.g. RNAi or CRISPR/
Cas9. We therefore attempted to generate cell lines to

complement our existing PDX biobank [13] but our
efforts were mostly unsuccessful. This has been a common
issue; generating cell lines from most solid tumors, has
been historically difficult [30–34]. To circumvent this we
decided to investigate if we could find any similarities
between well-known melanoma cell lines and our PDXs.
In order to avoid the confounding factor of culture, e.g.
fetal bovine serum induced gene expression, we first
transplanted all the cell line into mice and generated
GEPs from similarly sized tumors as those harvested from
PDXs. Unfortunately, we could not generate convincingly
inter-mixed clusters of gene expression. GEPs in cell lines
were very different from that in patient tumors or in their
corresponding PDXs.
There can be a number of reasons why CDXs and
PDXs differ in gene expression. When the cell lines were
generated, they had to adapt to culture condition that is
very different from the physiological conditions. First,
growing on plastic could exert a stress for the cancer cell
since it normally makes contact to an extracellular matrix.
Indeed, 3D cell cultures are viewed as better predictors of
therapy responses in vivo than 2D cultures [35]. Second,
cultured cells do not receive accurate balances of growth
factors from fetal bovine serum [36]; some factors can be
activating whilst others could be inhibiting growth. Third,
cultured cells are generally hyper-glycemic (> 0.2 g/l)
in the sense that they are cultured in up to 4.5 g/l of
glucose. This high glucose levels could result in excess
production of waste products such as lactate, which is not
removed by a circulation system as in a tumor tissue. The
so-called Warburg effect [37] could hence be a cell culture
artifact. Fourth, cells in culture are grown in the presence
of 20% oxygen, which could cause oxidative stress and
an irreversibly altered cell phenotype [38, 39]. All of
these factors likely contribute to selection barriers that are
circumvented in a clonal manner. The resulting cell line
will be highly adapted to the new conditions and may be
very different from a malignant cell residing in a tumor.
In light of our results and the known culture
adaptions of cell lines it is tempting to speculate that cell
lines transplanted into mice may experience stress due
to the physiological growth factor availabilities, oxygen
tension and glucose levels, which are all lower than
in cell culture. They could respond to this by inducing
a hypoxia response including expression of known
hypoxia inducible factor regulated genes such as carbonic
anhydrase IX (CA9) [40]. Indeed, there was markedly
higher expression of CA9 in CDXs as compared to PDXs
and patient biopsies, supporting the notion that the cultured
cells became ‘pseudo-hypoxic’ when grown in vivo. At this
time, we cannot rule out that different growth rates between
PDXs and CDXs play a role in the hypoxic appearance
of CDXs. We did note however that there was significant
variability in growth rates in both groups of xenografts,
suggesting that growth condition (normoxia) rather
than growth rate dictates the ‘hypoxic’ gene signature.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Interestingly, many studies have shown that dysregulated
CA9 expression is associated with poor clinical prognosis,
the metastatic phenotype, and drug resistance in different
cancers [40, 41]. These findings suggest that prolonged
cell culture in vitro rewires the transcriptome and this
could have large consequences for the utility of drug
treatment in CDXs as predictors of therapy responses in
patients. Reassuringly, and consistent with the observed
difference in CA9 expression, hsa-miR-210HG expression
was significantly different between PDXs and CDXs. The
role of miRNAs in hypoxia has previously been examined
[42], with a number of miRNAs thought to play a role in
hypoxia via different mechanisms [43]. hsa-miR-210 is
known as the “hypoxiamir” or “hypoxia master regulator”
[43], underscoring its role in hypoxia and its regulation. A
number of correlations between hsa-mir-210HG expression
and hypoxia-related genes known to be regulated by HIF1
or involved in glycolysis supported this here. These data
demonstrates that hypoxia contributes to the differences
between PDXs and CDXs.
The most surprising data from this study was that
all cell lines did not: 1) express similar amount of hsamiR-210, 2) respond similar to hypoxia in terms of protein
expression of CA9, RB or p-4EBP1 and 3) respond similar
to expression of hsa-miR-210 decoy [44]. Our results
suggest that hsa-miR-210 has a different role in different
contexts or cell types. Previously, hsa-miR-210 expression
was shown to be associated with aggressive tumors and
poor prognosis across malignancies; thereby making it
and/or its downstream targets attractive candidates for
therapeutic intervention [45–47]. Contrary to that, here
we show that engineering MML-1 cells to express a
hsa-miR-210 decoy did not block tumor growth in vivo,
rather it accelerated growth and caused the cells to be less
sensitive to inhibition of the established therapeutic target
MEK. An obvious difference could be that in our system,
we blocked hsa-miR-210 function in the tumor cells only
and the cells were grown in an immune compromised host.
It is thus plausible that the tumor promoting effects seen
e.g. in myeloid-derived suppressor cells expressing hsamiR-210 [47] is not visible in our system. Hence, our data
suggest that hsa-miR-210 belongs to the list of miRNA’s
including hsa-miR-26 that can act either as an oncogene or
as a tumor suppressor [48–50] depending on the cell and
the micro-environmental context.
The functional relevance of miRNAs is dependent on
the targets that they bind. In the case of hsa-miR-210, we
have not established which target(s) is responsible for the
reversal of cap-dependent translation inhibition of RB, CA9,
aggressive growth in vivo, and the reduced sensitivity to
MEK inhibitor in MML-1 cells engineered with hsa-miR-210
miR decoy. After mining potential miR targets, we speculated
that the decoy would increase total and phospho-ERK1/2.
However, there was little difference in phosphorylated
(T202/Y204) and total ERK1/2 between groups. There were
marginally higher levels of phosphorylated AKT (T308)
23807

RNA extraction and analysis

in some of the tumors arising in the decoy-engineered
group. The PI3K/AKT pathways is known to contribute to
malignant progression, either via membrane translocation or
phosphorylation of AKT [51]. CAP-dependent translation is
one of the first processes affected by stress such as hypoxia
[27, 52]. It prompts us to hypothesize that the reversal of
protein expression in decoy-engineered cells might occur as
a result of increased AKT levels, which in turn overrides the
protein synthesis machinery [53] and contributes to cellular
survival [54], thereby relieving the control mechanism
enforced by the miRNA.
To summarize, we have demonstrated that there are
distinct transcriptome-wide differences between CDXs and
PDXs, likely owing to the adaptions the cell lines once had
to undergo to become possible to culture. Since PDXs are
transcriptionally similar to the patient biopsies, our data
support the undergoing endeavors to use these models by
drug developers [16]. Moreover, we show that targeting
of hsa-miR-210 in metastatic melanoma cells might
have lethal consequences, as they tend to become more
aggressive and less sensitive to MEK inhibition in vivo.

RNA was extracted from PDXs and CDXs as
described previously [13]. For in vitro studies, QuickRNA™ MiniPrep (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) was used
as per the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA preparation and
qRT-PCR were performed as previously described [56]
using KiCqStart® SYBR® Green Primers (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MI). Gene expression profiling was performed
using RNA sequencing (RNAseq).

Bioinformatics analysis
To assess purity of the samples, clean reads were
mapped to several different species using default settings
in PRINSEQ [57]. In none of the samples there was more
than 5% reads from mouse, suggesting that contaminating
stroma will play a very limited contribution to the gene
expression profile. Thereafter, all RNAseq data was
analyzed as described previously [13]. The data was
annotated using GENCODE v19 [55], and the reads were
counted with HTSeq using default parameters. Differential
expression analysis for coding and miRNA genes was
performed using DESeq2 . After normalization, data
was transformed by variance-stabilizing transformation.
Heatmaps and PCA plots were generated with default
DESeq2 functions or using GENE-E (http://www.
broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/index.html).
Inclusion of genes in heatmaps depended on their p-value
and/or other analysis as mentioned.

Materials and methods
Mouse strain, xenografts, and treatment
All animal experiments were performed in
accordance with E.U. directive 2010/63 (regional
Gothenburg animal ethics committee approval #287/289–
12 and #36–2014). For cell line xenografts, cells were
suspended in RPMI, mixed 1:1 with Matrigel (BD
Biosciences), and 2 × 105 cells transplanted subcutaneously
into the flanks of immunocompromised, non-obese severe
combined immune deficient interleukin-2 chain receptor
γ knockout mice (NOG mice; Taconic, Denmark). For
transcriptome analyses, all CDX tumors were harvested
once they reached 100 –200 mm3 in size. To assess effects
of trametinib, xenografts whose growth were increased on
two consecutive measurements, were randomized to two
treatment groups: vehicle or trametinib (4 mg compound/kg
food = 1 mg/kg/day) (Selleckchem, Houston, TX) mixed in
the fodder (ResearchDiets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). Mice
were weighed and tumors measured using calipers twice a
week. Mice were euthanized when tumors were larger than
10 × 10 mm2 as per ethical regulations [55].

Plasmids were isolated using Qiagen Plasmid Plus
Midi Kit (Qiagen, Germany) as per the manufacturer’s

plates (Sarsted, Germany) one day prior to transfection.
Calcium phosphate-mediated transfection was performed
using packaging:envelope:transfer plasmids at a ratio of
0.259:0.087:0.345 µg/cm2, and virus was harvested 42, 46,
50 and 66 hours post transfection. The virus containing
supernatant passed through 0.45µM low protein-binding
filter (Sarstedt, Germany) filters.
A375, MML-1, and SK-MEL-2 cells were transduced
with 1 ml of virus containing 2–4 µg/ml of polybrene
(Sigma-Aldrich) per cell line and seeded on 6-well plates
(Sarstedt, Germany). 12 h post transduction, fresh media
was added and cells were allowed to grow for another 24
h. All cell lines were analyzed with BD Accuri C6 FCM
(BD Biosciences, USA) for GFP expression before further
experiments were performed (data not shown).

Cell culture
All cell lines except HEK-293T (ATCC, Manassas,
VA) were purchased from CLS Cell Lines Service
GmbH (Eppelehim, Germany) and cultured as per
the manufacturer’s protocol using media from Gibco
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and FBS
from HyCLONE (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, USA).
All media were supplemented with gentamicin (Thermo
