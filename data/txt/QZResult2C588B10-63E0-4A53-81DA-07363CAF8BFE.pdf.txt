BACKGROUND. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the growth kinetics of
metastatic brain tumors during chemotherapy and to analyze growth rates and
volumetric doubling time of metastatic brain tumors in patients with nonsmall
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with tumor regrowth.

METHODS. NSCLC patients with minimally symptomatic brain metastases who
were not treated previously were enrolled. Serial magnetic resonance images
(MRI) of 30 metastatic brain tumors in 19 patients were reviewed. Tumor growth
rates and volumetric tumor doubling time of tumor regrowth were estimated. All
patients were treated with front-line chemotherapy until disease progression.

RESULTS. The median tumor growth rate was 12.10 mm3/day (interquartile range

rain metastases are a frequent occurrence in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an estimated incidence of
20% to 30% of cases.1 An autopsy series found brain metastases in
up to 50% of NSCLC patients.2 However, very little is known about
the growth kinetics of metastatic brain tumors in this group of
patients. In an attempt to assess growth kinetics and to determine
appropriate follow-up and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) interval, we undertook a study on the evolution of metastatic brain
tumors in patients with NSCLC during front-line chemotherapy. A
better knowledge of the growth rate of these metastatic tumors may
lead to revisions of current recommendations for management of
metastatic brain tumors in lung cancer patients.

[AST], and alkaline phosphatase < double upper
limit of normal), renal function (serum creatinine
<1.1 mg/dL), and cardiac function were required. All
patients in this study were informed and consented
to participation. This study was approved by our
institutional review board. MRIs of 30 consecutive
metastatic brain tumors from 19 patients followed
between 2001 and 2007 were reviewed (GE Signa
MR/I 1.5T, software v. 9.1 M4; General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisc). Chemotherapy was
repeated unless life-threatening toxicity or disease
progression occurred. Patients were dropped from
the study when brain surgery or radiation treatment
was required because of progression of neurologic
symptoms or metastatic brain tumor growth. When
patients’ symptoms indicated, steroid treatment was
provided. Tumor volume was determined by using Vworks software (v. 4.0) (Cybermed, Seoul, Korea). We
used T1 FLAIR gadolinium enhanced images (TR
3000, TE 24, inversion time 860 ms, 4-mm slice
thickness, 1-mm gap, 256 3 192 matrix). Most
patients in this study were neurologically asymptomatic because they had small metastases. Therefore,
we used FLAIR images to delineate the metastatic
lesions better. Changes in gross tumor volume were
measured on serial MRIs. For each patient, the volume doubling time was calculated by using the following equation based on the time interval between
the MRIs and the ratio of the gross volumes: volume
doubling time 5 days*log2/(logV12logV0); V0: tumor
volume before regrowth; V1: tumor volume after
regrowth.

Statistical Analysis
A linear regression model was used to estimate the
average increase in volume and volume percentage.
The model assumed that the effect of time is linear.
However, it may well be that the outcome does not
have a linear relation with time. Hence, we added a
quadratic term of time in the model.
To generate a prediction model for tumor
regrowth, we used a multilevel mixed effect linear
model with identity covariance and maximum likelihood estimates for model fit.
To compare the growth rate between the 2
chemotherapy groups, we used the Mann-Whitney U
test.

RESULTS
Clinical Data
Between June 2001 and March 2007, 19 chemotherapy-naive NSCLC patients (9 women and 10 men)
with brain metastases fulfilled eligibility criteria. The

mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 61.58 (9.19)
years (median, 64 years; range, 36-72 years). A single
metastasis was noted in 12 patients, and multiple
metastases were noted in 7 patients. The diagnosis of
brain metastases was made concomitantly with the
primary tumor in all cases. Neurologic symptoms
were absent or minimal in all cases at the time of diagnosis. Overall, 88 full MRI examinations were available. The mean number of MRI studies per patient
was 4.33 (median, 4; range, 3-10). The mean duration
of radiologic follow-up was 310.95 days (median, 247
days; range, 89-827 days). Chemotherapy regimens
included gemcitabine and vinorelbine in 13 patients,
docetaxel and capecitabine in 3, irrinotecan and cisplatin in 2, and irrinotecan and capecitabine in 1.

Growth Rates and Volume Doubling Time
The evolution of the tumor volume over time for
each patient is presented in Figure 1. The median
volume of tumor on the first MRI was 668 mm3
(range, 41-27,713 mm3). Growth curves showed a

growth-delay period and a regrowth phase. The median growth-delay period was 105 days (interquartile
range [IQR], 61-214 days). The median growth rate of
the metastatic brain tumors after regrowth was 12.10
mm3/day (IQR, 3.09-36.75). The median tumor
growth in terms of percentage change in tumor volume was 1.67% increase/day (IQR, 0.69-4.59). The
median volumetric tumor doubling time after
regrowth was 58.5 days (IQR, 32.3-98.5). There was a
statistically significant difference in growth rate
between the gencitabine-vinorelbine group and the
remaining chemotherapy group. The median daily
percentile increase of the tumor volume of the gemcitabine-vinorelbine group was 1.34, whereas that of
the remaining chemotherapy group was 4.59
(P 5 .01). Although the number of the remaining
group was small, this result shows that it may be
possible that gemcitabine and vinorelbine are more
effective in suppressing growth of metastatic brain
tumors than other regimens. There was no significant difference in growth rate between men and
women. The median daily percentile increase of the
tumor volume of male patients was 3.44 and 1.63 for
female patients (P 5 .63). The prediction of volume
and volume percentage were produced by using the
multilevel mixed effect linear model presented in
Figure 2.

DISCUSSION
The goal of this study was to evaluate the natural
history of metastatic brain tumors in patients with
NSCLC. However, it is impossible to obtain the complete natural history of metastatic brain tumors in
the clinical setting. Therefore, we analyzed growth
patterns of metastatic brain tumors during systemic
chemotherapy before administration of brain surgery
or radiation therapy. After chemotherapy, there
should be a deviation from the natural exponential
tumor growth. However, growth rate and volume
doubling time in this report may be similar to natural growth kinetics of metastatic brain tumors
because these results were obtained after chemoresistance developed.
Many investigators have estimated tumor growth
rates of various types of lung cancers by using chest
computed tomography (CT). Aoki et al3 measured tumor growth with serial CT examinations in 10
patients with adenocarcinoma before treatment.
However, they used only mean tumor diameters, not
volume, and did not separate CT-derived results
from radiographic measurements. Combined CT and
radiographic results yielded doubling times ranging
from 42 days to 1486 days. As part of a screening

program, Hasegawa et al4 measured the doubling
time of nodules on successive CT images in 61
patients whose nodules were later proven to be cancerous and found that doubling time ranged from 52
days to 1733 days (mean, 452 days; median not
reported). In their study, however, the largest nodular
cross-sectional area, not volume, was used in doubling time calculations. Yankelevitz et al5 used automated 3-dimensional reconstruction of CT images to
measure growth of small nodules in 13 patients. In
their study, all benign tumors had a doubling time
greater than 395 days, and all malignant tumors had
a doubling time less than 178 days. In 1 series of 67
patients, doubling time ranged from 30 dyas to 490
days.6 In another review article describing 52
patients, doubling time varied from 1 month to 14
months.7 Lindell et al8 reported that mean volume
doubling time was 518 days (median, 166 days;
range, 10-5810 days) in 48 cancers before treatment.
They calculated a mean volume doubling time of 688
days for women and 234 days for men. In their study,
the longer mean volume-doubling time for women

appeared to reflect a higher incidence of less aggressive tumor histologic types in women. Interestingly,
nearly every tumor histological subtype in these
women had a longer mean volume doubling time
than did the subtypes in men. However, this was not

the case in our study. Jennings et al9 reported a median doubling time of 207 days in stage I pretreatment lung cancer and presence of wide variability in
growth rates. Winer-Muram et al10 reported a median
doubling time of 181 days in stage I lung cancer,
with a very wide range, and considerable overlap in
doubling time between histologic subtypes.
However, very little is known about growth
kinetics of metastatic brain tumors. The median volume doubling time of 58.5 days in our study is far
less than that of NSCLC in untreated patients
reported in the literature.3-10 These differences may
be explained by the following: 1) Stage I lung cancer
cells may be in a dormant stage. The behavior of the
metastatic brain tumor cells may be different (stage
IV). 2) Tumor environment (angiogenesis, invasion,
and growth factors) may be different in stage I and
IV patients. 3) Repopulation of cancer cells may
occur in metastatic brain tumors. 4) There may be a
different tumor environment (extracellular matrix) of
the lungs and brain.
Conversely, El Sharouni et al11 reported an accelerated tumor growth rate after induction chemotherapy. In their study, tumor doubling times ranged
from 8.3 to 171 days, with a mean value of 46 days
and median value of 29 days. These results are similar to our results indicating that chemotherapy was
effective for the metastatic brain tumors; the exposed

Growth Rates of Metastatic Brain Tumors/Yoo et al

cancer cells in the brain showed similar biologic
behavior.
There are many publications on experimental
tumors that have shown rates of repopulation after
radiotherapy equal to or often faster than rates of
cell repopulation in tumors without exposure to
radiotherapy.12-14 In the present study, doubling time
was much lower for treated NSCLC compared with
untreated NSCLC. This suggests an accelerated repopulation of the surviving cells after the chemotherapy
course. Our findings are consistent with those of
others who have observed a rapid regrowth after
chemotherapy11 and/or irradiation.12-14

Conclusions
This is the first report to describe growth rate and
volume doubling time of metastatic brain tumors in
patients with NSCLC. These results may be useful in
the clinical setting to determine intervals for evaluating MRI changes in patients with metastatic brain
tumors.
