Abstract
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are caused by activating mutations in the KIT or platelet-derived growth factor
receptor A receptor tyrosine kinase genes. Approximately 85%
of GIST patients treated with imatinib mesylate achieve
disease stabilization, however, often in the presence of
residual tumor masses. Complete remissions are rare and a
substantial proportion of patients develop resistance to
imatinib. Our study was designed to determine whether
imatinib-associated responses may account for these clinical
findings. We report here that imatinib stimulates cellular
quiescence in a proportion of GIST cells as evidenced by upregulation of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1, loss of cyclin A, and
reduced BrdUrd incorporation. Mechanistically, these events
are associated with an imatinib-induced modulation of the
APC/CDH1 signaling axis. Specifically, we provide evidence
that imatinib down-regulates SKP2 and that this event is
associated with increased nuclear CDH1, an activator of the
APC that has been shown to regulate SKP2 stability. We also
show that those GIST cells that do not undergo apoptosis in
response to imatinib overexpress nuclear p27Kip1, indicating
that they have withdrawn from the cell cycle and are
quiescent. Lastly, we provide evidence that a fraction of
primary GISTs with high SKP2 expression levels may have an
increased risk of disease progression. Taken together, our
results support a model in which GIST cells that do not
respond to imatinib by apoptosis are removed from the
proliferative pool by entering quiescence through modulation
of the APC/CDH1-SKP2-p27Kip1 signaling axis. These results
encourage further studies to explore compounds that modulate this pathway as antitumor agents in GISTs. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common
mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. They are
caused by activating mutations in the KIT or platelet-derived
growth factor receptor a receptor tyrosine kinase genes (1–3)
and can be effectively treated with the small molecule kinase
inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI571; Gleevec; ref. 4). Approximately 85% of patients with metastatic GIST benefit from

imatinib therapy; however, complete responses are rare (4–6).
Remarkably, many patients treated with imatinib achieve a longterm stabilization of disease in the presence of residual tumor.
These clinical findings and several experimental results (7)
strongly suggest that tumor cell quiescence plays an important
role in imatinib therapy of GIST.
Tumor cell quiescence is a major obstacle for successful cancer
therapy because quiescent cells do not respond to anticancer
agents that target proliferating cells (8). Furthermore, quiescent
cells can remain viable and in particular tumor cells with impaired
checkpoint control may re-enter the cell division cycle resulting in
disease progression. Quiescence is defined by a reversible exit from
the cell division cycle in G0-G1 (9). Experimentally, quiescence can
be induced by growth factor withdrawal, contact inhibition and
loss of adhesion (10). The major regulators of tumor cell quiescence
are not known in detail but several lines of evidence suggest that
the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 is critically involved
(11–13).
p27Kip1 is regulated on multiple levels including phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation (14). In cells that are in S or G2
phase of the cell division cycle, high cyclin/CDK activity triggers
phosphorylation of p27Kip1, which is subsequently degraded,
thereby maintaining low p27Kip1 expression levels (15). Degradation of p27Kip1 is primarily regulated by the SCFSKP2 E3 ubiquitin
ligase (13). Several reports provide evidence for a second layer of
regulation in which the F-box protein SKP2 is itself regulated by
an ubiquitin ligase, the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC)/
CDH1 complex (16, 17). The APC becomes activated in
prometaphase and remains active until the late G1 phase of the
cell cycle. It requires two activators, CDC20 during mitosis and
CDH1 primarily after mitotic exit (18, 19). The APC/CDC20
complex mediates the degradation of securin, an inhibitor of sister
chromatid separation, as well as cyclin B1, an inhibitor of mitotic
exit. In addition, the APC/CDC20 mediates the degradation of
several other substrates, such as cyclin A, which starts after
nuclear envelope breakdown. After inactivation of cyclin B1/
CDK1, APC/CDH1 functions to polyubiquitinate SKP2 as well as
cyclin A, hence promoting the accumulation of p27Kip1 and
suppression of CDK in G0-G1 (16, 17). Taken together, the APC/
CDH1 complex is critical for reinforcing G0-G1 arrest and hence
for keeping cells in a quiescent state.
Based on the clinical findings described above, the present study
was designed to explore whether imatinib modulates signaling
pathways that have been implicated in tumor cell quiescence. We
show that imatinib treatment of GIST cells results in a significant
down-regulation of SKP2 and an up-regulation of the CDK inhibitor
p27Kip1. We show that these events are preceded by a redistribution
of the APC activator CDH1 to the nucleus. Conversely, overexpression of SKP2 can protect GIST cells from imatinib-induced
cell cycle arrest. We show that imatinib-treated GIST cells that do

not undergo apoptosis overexpress p27Kip1, indicating that they
have withdrawn from the cell cycle. Lastly, we provide evidence
that high expression of SKP2 in primary GISTs may be associated
with an unfavorable prognosis. Our results provide the framework
for future studies to target this signaling pathway to thwart tumor
cell quiescence with the goal to achieve more complete and longterm remissions.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, inhibitor treatments, and transfections. The human
GIST cell line GIST882 was derived from an untreated metastatic GIST and
maintained in RPMI1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum
(Mediatech), 1% L-Glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin (Cambrex), and 50 Ag/mL
streptomycin (Cambrex) as described earlier (7).
Cells were incubated in imatinib mesylate (1 Amol/L in DMSO; kindly
provided by Novartis Pharma AG), the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (25 Amol/L
in DMSO; EMD Biosciences), the MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)1/MEK2 inhibitor
U0126 (10 Amol/L in DMSO; EMD Biosciences), or mock treated with
0.1% DMSO for up to 72 h or as indicated.
Transient transfection of GIST882 cells was carried out by using the
Amaxa nucleofection device (Amaxa). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and
3  106 cells per experiment were transfected with 5 Ag of plasmid DNA
(20). A pcDNA3-based expression plasmid encoding human SKP2 was a
generous gift from Wilhelm Krek (ETH, Zürich, Switzerland;
ref. 13). A plasmid encoding HA-tagged CDH1 was a generous gift from
Michele Pagano (New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY;
ref. 16).
For small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments, pooled synthetic (SKP2)
and single (CDH1) RNA duplexes were used to reduce SKP2 and CDH1
protein expression, respectively (Dharmacon). Briefly, GIST882 cells were
trypsinized and 3  106 cells were transfected with 5 AL of 20 Amol/L
annealed RNA duplexes using nucleofection (Amaxa). Cells were then
transferred to 35-mm tissue culture dishes with 2 mL RPMI1640 free of
antibiotics. Experiments were performed at the indicated time points.
Immunologic and cell staining methods. Protein lysates of cells
growing as monolayer were prepared by scraping cells into radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [1% NP40, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 100 mmol/L sodium fluoride, 30 mmol/L sodium PPi, 2 mmol/L
sodium molybdate, 5 mmol/L EDTA, and 2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate]
containing protease inhibitors (10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin,
and 1 Amol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were incubated for
1 h with shaking at 4jC and then cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at
14,000 rpm at 4jC. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad). Thirty micrograms of protein were loaded on a 4% to 12%
Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane.
For immunofluorescence analysis, cells grown on coverslips were briefly
washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room
temperature. Cells were then washed in PBS and permeabilized with 1%
Triton-X 100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature followed by washing in
PBS and blocking with 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with
primary antibodies overnight at 4jC in a humidified chamber and
incubated for another 3 h at 37jC the next morning. After a brief wash
in PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(Jackson Immunoresearch) for at least 2 h at 37jC, washed with PBS, and
counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). Cells were analyzed using an Olympus AX70 epifluorescence
microscope equipped with a SpotRT digital camera.
Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence
were SKP2 clone 8D9 (Zymed), p27Kip1 (BD Biosciences PharMingen),
cyclin A (Novocastra), CUL1 (Santa Cruz), CDH1 (LabVision), phospho-KIT
Y703 (Zymed), KIT (DakoCytomation), phospho-AKT S473 (Cell Signaling),
total AKT (Cell Signaling), phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) T202/Y204 (Cell Signaling), total MAPK (Cell Signaling), and actin
(Sigma).

BrdUrd assay. To assess the proliferating cell fraction, GIST882 cells
were incubated in BrdUrd labeling medium (Roche) for 2 h. Cells were then
washed in PBS and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min. After another
wash in PBS, DNA was denatured by incubation in 2N HCl for 1 h at 37jC.
The HCl was neutralized by immersion in 0.1 mol/L borate buffer (pH 8.5),
before incubation with a mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Roche)
overnight at 4jC in a humidified chamber. Detection and analysis was
performed as described above.
GIST tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. A total of 28
cores from primary and metastatic GIST and 7 controls (liver) were
collected from the archives of the Department of Pathology of the
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (IRB#0509050). Slides were
processed as previously described (21, 22), and SKP2 was detected using
clone 2C8D9 (Zymed). The number of SKP2-positive cells was determined
per high power field (HPF; 40).

Results
Imatinib treatment of GIST cells leads to exit from the cell
cycle through down-regulation of SKP2 and increased expression of p27Kip1. To ascertain whether imatinib modulates signaling
pathways that have been implicated in cell cycle quiescence, we
treated the GIST-derived cell line GIST882 with 1 Amol/L imatinib
for up to 72 hours and analyzed cells by immunoblotting. We found
that the levels of SKP2 decreased significantly after 72 hours of
imatinib treatment with levels beginning to decline at 48 hours
(Fig. 1A). By contrast, the levels of another component of the
SCF-SKP2 complex, CUL1, did not change, indicating that the
changes in SKP2 protein expression were not due to a general
down-regulation of the SCF components. An up-regulation of the
CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 was detected with maximum levels at 48 to
72 hours. Immunoblotting for expression levels of cyclin A revealed
a significantly reduced expression indicating that a substantial
proportion of cells had exited from S phase. In addition, these
results suggest an increased activity of APC/CDH1 resulting in
accelerated degradation of its substrates, SKP2 and cyclin A. As
expected, imatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of KIT and its
downstream targets (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
To further corroborate these results, an immunofluorescence
microscopic analysis for SKP2 was performed. This experiment
showed a significant loss of SKP2 expression in imatinib-treated
GIST882 cells at 72 hours. These results confirm and extend
previous studies (7) and indicate that imatinib treatment indeed
induces quiescence as evidenced by exit from S phase in GIST cells.
They furthermore suggest that imatinib can interfere with
upstream regulatory pathways that modulate p27Kip1 stability,
namely the F-box protein SKP2.
Imatinib-induced quiescence is dependent on the PI3K/AKT
pathway. We next asked which pathways downstream of KIT are
involved in the down-regulation of SKP2 after imatinib. Inhibition
of PI3K by LY294002 led to a down-regulation of SKP2 that was
similar to what was seen after imatinib treatment (Fig. 1C).
Consequently, levels of p27Kip1 increased and the amounts of Cyclin
A decreased significantly at 24 to 72 hours after treatment with this
compound. No change in the levels of CUL1 protein expression was
detected. As expected, LY294002 treatment inhibited AKT phosphorylation but had no effect on KIT phosphorylation or MAPK
activity (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
In contrast, MEK1/MEK2 inhibition by U0126 had no effect on
the levels of SKP2 and, consequently, also did not lead to changes
in the amounts of p27Kip1 or cyclin A (Fig. 1D). U0126 treatment
only inhibited MAPK phosphorylation but had no effect on KIT or
PI3K/AKT activity (Supplementary Fig. S1C).

Taken together, these results suggest that the PI3K pathway, but
not the MAPK pathway, is involved in the down-regulation of SKP2
induced by imatinib treatment.
Imatinib treatment leads to nuclear redistribution of CDH1.
Our results suggest that imatinib treatment leads to cell cycle exit
through down-regulation of SKP2 and subsequent stabilization of
p27Kip1. We analyzed next whether imatinib modulates the SKP2
degradation machinery, in particular the APC/CDH1 complex.
We did not find any significant changes in the total amount of
CDH1 protein after imatinib by immunoblotting (data not shown).
We hence performed an immunofluorescence microscopic analysis
to determine the subcellular localization of CDH1 after imatinib
treatment of GIST cells. CDH1 showed a nuclear and cytoplasmic
localization in DMSO-treated control cells. In contrast, we found a
rapid redistribution of CDH1 to the nucleus beginning 1 hour after
start of the treatment with 1 Amol/L imatinib (Fig. 2). Previous
reports have shown that activation of the APC requires nuclear
localization of CDH1 (23, 24). Our results therefore suggest that the
ability of imatinib to modulate CDH1 localization may be involved
in cell cycle exit and quiescence.
Down-regulation of SKP2 leads to up-regulation of p27Kip1
and a growth arrest in GIST cells. To corroborate these results,
we sought to determine more directly whether the CDH1/SKP2 axis
is involved in cell cycle regulation and quiescence in GIST882 cells.
When we reduced SKP2 levels by siRNA, we detected an increase of
p27Kip1 and a decrease of cyclin A expression (Fig. 3A, left). This
was associated with a significant decrease of cells in S phase as
measured by BrdUrd incoporation from 30% in cells transfected
with control siRNA duplexes to 4.4%, 2.1%, and 1.8% in cells

www.aacrjournals.org

transfected with siRNA against SKP2 for 24, 48, and 72 hours,
respectively (P V 0.0001; Fig. 3A, right).
Transient overexpression of CDH1 led to a down-regulation of
SKP2 protein expression, a moderate increase of p27Kip1 levels, and
decreased expression of cyclin A (Fig. 3B, left). Likewise, cells also
showed a decreased incorporation of BrdUrd from 17.6% in cells
transfected with empty vector to 5.1% and 6.9% in cells transfected
with CDH1 plasmids at 24 and 48 hours, respectively (P V 0.0001;
Fig. 3B, right).
Conversely, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of CDH1 was
associated with a moderate increase of SKP2 levels, downregulation of p27Kip1 and up-regulation of cyclin A (Fig. 3C, left).
Transfection of cells with siRNA targeting CDH1 caused an
increase of cells in S phase as measured by BrdUrd incorporation
from 15% in controls to 23.5%, 67.7%, and 39.4% after 24, 48, and
72 hours, respectively (P V 0.001; Fig. 3C, right).
Taken together, these results show that modulation of the CDH1SKP2-p27Kip1 signaling pathway in GIST cells has significant effect
on cell proliferation and, hence, underscore the central role of this
pathway in GIST cell cycle exit and quiescence.
The imatinib-induced cell cycle exit depends on SKP2. We
next wanted to test directly whether SKP2 can modulate exit from
the cell division cycle in imatinib-treated GIST882 cells. Cells were
transiently transfected with either empty vector or SKP2 plasmid
DNA followed by treatment with either DMSO or 1 Amol/L
imatinib for a total of 48 hours starting 24 hours after transfection.
The proportion of proliferating cells was assessed by BrdUrd
incorporation (Fig. 4A). A 1.7-fold increase of cells in S phase
was detected in DMSO-treated populations from 19% in empty

vector-transfected cells to 32% in SKP2-transfected populations
(P V 0.01; Fig. 4B). Imatinib treatment caused a significant decrease
of cells in S phase from 19% to 2.4% in empty vector-transfected
populations (P V 0.0001). However, overexpression of SKP2 in
imatinib-treated populations was found to impede cell cycle exit
and a significant proportion of cells remained in S phase (17.7%)
with no significant differences between empty vector– and SKP2transfected controls (19% and 32%, respectively; P > 0.05; Fig. 4A
and B).
These results indicate that overexpression of SKP2 significantly
attenuates the cell cycle exit induced by imatinib and underscore
the role of the CDH1-SKP2-p27Kip1 axis in GIST cell cycle exit and
quiescence.
Cells that survive imatinib treatment overexpress nuclear
p27Kip1. Based on our results, we speculated that cells that do
not undergo apoptosis in response to imatinib should be driven
into quiescence and express high levels of nuclear p27Kip1. To
test this idea, we treated GIST882 cells for up to 72 with
imatinib compared with DMSO used as control. Cells were then
analyzed for nuclear p27Kip1 expression by immunofluorescence
microscopy (Fig. 5). We found a significant increase of cells
displaying nuclear p27Kip1 in imatinib-treated GIST882 populations from 12% in DMSO-treated controls to 54.6% after
24 hours, 73.1% after 48 hours, and 86.4% after 72 hours of
imatinib treatment (all P V 0.0001; Fig. 5B). Cells with an
apoptotic phenotype typically had no nuclear p27Kip1 expression
and our results hence indicate that GIST cells that do not
undergo apoptosis in response to imatinib instead up-regulate
p27Kip1 and exit the cell cycle. Cells undergoing apoptosis after
imatinib treatment increased from 0.7% in DMSO-treated
controls to 0.8% after 24 hours, 5.7% after 48 hours, and 14.2%
after 72 hours of imatinib treatment. These numbers, however,
do not reflect the percentage of f70% to 80% of cells
undergoing apoptosis after imatinib that is usually seen in this
cell type (20). The main reason for this are the experimental
conditions used here where many of the loosely attached
apoptotic cells were lost during the harsh staining process.
SKP2 is expressed in primary GISTs. Our in vitro results
suggest that SKP2 is a critical regulator of cell cycle exit

in imatinib-treated GIST882 cells. We therefore sought to
determine SKP2 expression in a series of primary GISTs. An
immunohistochemical analysis of 28 primary GISTs and seven
normal control tissue specimens was performed. Nineteen of 28
cases (68%) contained cells expressing detectable levels of SKP2
with some GISTs showing an expression that was similar to highly
proliferative tissues such as crypts of the small bowel (Fig. 6).
The average number of SKP2-positive cells per core was
determined by counting 2 HPF (40) from 2 independent
experiments. The overall average number of SKP2-positive cells
per HPF was 4.6 with a range from 0 to 56 SKP2-positive cells per
HPF. Twenty-three GISTs showed 0 to 5 SKP2-positive cells/HPF,
2 GISTs had 6 to 10 SKP2-positive cells/HPF, and 3 showed >10
SKP2-positive cells/HPF.
We obtained the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) risk score for all patients (25). This scoring system
stratifies GIST patients into very low, low, intermediate, high, or
no risk of progressive disease based on tumor size, organ site,
and mitotic index. Two cases could not be stratified into risk
groups because of insufficient data for their tumor localization
at time of publishing the NCCN risk score (25). We found a
significant correlation between high risk of progressive disease
and >5 SKP2-positive cells per HPF (m2 test P V 0.0006; Fig. 6B).
These cases also had a significantly higher mitotic count (>5
mitoses/50 HPF; P V 0.0001; Fig. 6B). Conversely, most patients
with no to intermediate risk for progression showed V5 SKP2positive cells per HPF and a low mitotic count of V5 mitoses per
50 HPF.

Discussion
Approximately 85% of GIST patients treated with imatinib
achieve disease stabilization, however, often in the presence of
residual tumor masses. Complete remissions are rare and a
substantial proportion of patients develop resistance to imatinib
over time (4–6).
The present study was designed to determine whether
imatinib-associated responses may account for these clinical
findings. We report here that imatinib stimulates quiescence in a

proportion of GIST cells that is associated with an imatinibinduced modulation of the CDH1-SKP2 signaling axis in GIST
cells. We provide evidence that imatinib down-regulates SKP2 and
that this event is associated with increased nuclear CDH1, an
activator of the APC that has previously been shown to regulate
SKP2 stability. We also show that GIST cells, which do not
undergo apoptosis in response to imatinib express nuclear
p27Kip1, suggesting that they have withdrawn from the cell cycle.
Lastly, we provide evidence that a fraction of primary GISTs with
high SKP2 expression levels may have an increased risk of disease
progression.

Some of our findings raise important questions that warrant
further investigation. First, it is worth pointing out that the cell line
used in this study, GIST882, possesses a homozygous missense
mutation affecting one of the kinase domains of the KIT gene
(exon 13). This is a very uncommon mutation in GISTs that is seen
only in f1% of cases. Because studies on patient response suggest
that tumors with these mutations do not respond as well to
imatinib as GISTs harboring the more common mutations in exons
9 and 11, the antiproliferative effect of imatinib in vitro may also
be different in this cell line. It will therefore be imperative to verify
our results in other GIST cell lines harboring activating mutations

outside of the kinase domain. Furthermore, it will be worthwhile to
compare SKP2 and p27Kip1 immunohistochemistry in matched
preimatinib and postimatinib samples, such as GIST xenograft
models. These experiments are currently under way in our
laboratory.
Second, all of our experiments have been performed within a
72-hour treatment interval and we do not know how long cells are
able to remain in a quiescent state. It is possible that a prolonged
cell cycle arrest requires continued inhibition of KIT, which is in
line with the clinical observation that patients that discontinue
imatinib treatment are more likely to develop disease progression.
Quiescence is defined as reversible cell cycle arrest in G0 and our
findings that p27Kip1 is increased, whereas cyclin A expression is
diminished are in line with this notion and furthermore
underscore the important role of APC/CDH1 in maintaining
cellular quiescence. Although quiescent cells are viable, prolonged
quiescence may lead to apoptosis. Whether some of these cells also
acquire markers of senescence and hence irreversibly withdraw
from the cell cycle remains to be determined. Moreover,
modulation of the CDH1-SKP2-p27Kip1 axis might not be the only
pathway leading to and maintaining quiescence in GIST cells
treated with imatinib. Recent reports, for example, show that
constitutive, CUL3-mediated degradation of cyclin E is required for
quiescence in hepatocytes (26). Further research will therefore be
necessary to dissect the exact mechanisms of quiescence in
imatinib-treated GIST.
Third, the precise mechanism of imatinib-induced redistribution
of CDH1 into the nuclear compartment remains to be determined.
Previous reports have shown that active APC/CDH1 complexes
localize to the nucleus and that relocalization of CDH1 to the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

cytoplasm inactivates the APC (24). In yeast, CDH1 is nuclear
during G1 and is exported into the cytoplasm in S phase until the
end of mitosis, which is regulated by phosphorylation (23). Other
studies have shown that PI3K can up-regulate SKP2 levels (27). Our
results suggest that KIT-PI3K signaling may be important for
preventing CDH1 localization to the nucleus thereby increasing
SKP2 expression, but more detailed studies to address this
question are necessary.
Our study confirms and extends previous reports analyzing the
cellular response to imatinib in a different malignancy, chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML). Treatment of CML cells with imatinib
led to a relocalization of p27Kip1 to the nucleus in a PI3Kdependent manner. Remarkably, erlotinib treatment of non–small
cell lung cancer cells expressing mutated epidermal growth factor
receptor likewise induced the translocation of p27Kip1 to the
nucleus and increased the half-life of p27Kip1 by down-regulation
of SKP2 expression (28). These results suggest that certain
similarities in the mode of action of small molecule kinase
inhibitors may exist.
A large number of studies have examined expression of
members of the SKP2-p27Kip1 axis in human cancer of all
types. In fact, the majority of malignant tumors showed a
reduction of p27Kip1 protein levels (29). More recently, it has
become clear that deregulation of SKP2 in human cancer is
involved in the down-regulation of p27Kip1 (30–32). Both, reduced
levels of p27Kip1 and overexpression of SKP2, have been shown
to correlate with poor prognosis in breast cancer and other
tumors (30, 33–37). The relevance of SKP2 as prognostic marker
in GISTs needs to be validated in a larger cohort of patients and
in a prospective manner. Whether SKP2 is a more accurate

prognostic marker than decreased levels of the CDK inhibitor
p27Kip1 in GIST (38, 39) remains likewise to be determined.
There is mounting evidence that imatinib affects GIST cell
proliferation and apoptosis through multiple pathways. We have
recently described a novel proapoptotic pathway in GIST cells
that involves soluble histone H2AX (20). In the present study,
we show that imatinib can also drive GIST cells into cell cycle
arrest and quiescence. In fact, the pathway leading to tumor
cell quiescence may even be more relevant for the response
to imatinib as judged by certain clinical findings and results
from GIST mouse models that show a relatively moderate
increase of apoptosis in response to imatinib (40). Our results

suggest that apoptosis and quiescence are, at least in the
time frame of our experiments, mutually exclusive, and future
studies are warranted to determine why tumor cells respond
differently to imatinib therapy. Our results would suggest a
model in which GIST cells that are not rapidly eliminated by
imatinib-induced apoptosis exit the cell cycle and enter
quiescence. These results help to explain the clinical observations that many patients develop stable disease in the presence
of residual tumor and that complete remissions are overall
relatively rare.
Future studies will focus on the question whether it is possible
to revert quiescent GIST cells into a state in which they can

approaches to shift the cellular responses to imatinib toward
apoptosis instead of cell cycle arrest are necessary to make
imatinib-based therapies more effective with a goal toward cure.
