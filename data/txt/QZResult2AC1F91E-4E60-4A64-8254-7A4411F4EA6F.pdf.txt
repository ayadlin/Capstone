Abstract
Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) are derived from multiple sources, including bone marrow (circulating
endothelial progenitors; CEP), and established vasculature (mature CEC). Although CECs have shown promise as
a biomarker for patients with cancer, their utility has been limited, in part, by the lack of speciﬁcity for tumor
vasculature and the different nonmalignant causes that can impact CEC. Tumor endothelial markers (TEM) are
antigens enriched in tumor versus nonmalignant endothelia. We hypothesized that TEMs may be detectable on
CEC and that these circulating TEMþ endothelial cells (CTEC) may be a more speciﬁc marker for cancer and
tumor response than standard CEC. We found that tumor-bearing mice had a relative increase in numbers of
circulating CTEC, speciﬁcally with increased levels of TEM7 and TEM8 expression. Following treatment with
various vascular-targeting agents, we observed a decrease in CTEC that correlated with the reductions in tumor
growth. We extended these ﬁndings to human clinical samples and observed that CTECs were present in patients
with esophageal cancer and non–small cell lung cancer (N ¼ 40), and their levels decreased after surgical
resection. These results demonstrate that CTECs are detectable in preclinical cancer models and patients
with cancer. Furthermore, they suggest that CTECs offer a novel cancer-associated marker that may be useful
as a blood-based surrogate for assessing the presence of tumor vasculature and antiangiogenic drug activity.

Introduction
Angiogenesis is a key step in tumor progression, including
the spread and growth of metastases. Therefore, considerable
effort has been directed at targeting the vascular component of
malignant disease. Antiangiogenic agents targeting the VEGF
pathway, such as the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab and
the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AZD2171, have demonstrated
clinical activity in multiple malignancies, including non–small

cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell cancer, and colorectal
cancer (1–5). Currently, clinical studies evaluating the efﬁcacy
of such agents are hindered by the lack of validated surrogate
markers of drug activity. Availability of blood-based biomarkers would be paramount because they could predict which
patients are most likely to beneﬁt from treatment before
clinical progression (6, 7).
In recent years, we and other investigators have studied a
number of circulating biomarkers for VEGF pathway inhibition
in peripheral blood that are derived from circulating endothelial cells (CEC) and myeloid lineage cells, circulating proangiogenic factors and receptors, and soluble markers of hypoxia
and endothelial damage (7–11). Elevated levels of CECs
(CD45CD31þCD146þ cells) are detected in patients with
renal cell carcinoma cancer as compared with the levels found
in normal control subjects and are associated with advanced
disease (12). It has become evident that among CECs in blood,
some express a progenitor-like phenotype deﬁned as circulating endothelial progenitors (CEP), whereas others show the
characteristics of mature, terminally differentiated cells
(mature CECs). Although mature CECs are thought to shed
from existing vessels, CEPs are derived from the bone marrow
and can home to sites of angiogenesis and participate in the
generation of new vessels in adults (13, 14).
Both CECs and CEPs have been investigated as biomarkers
for antiangiogenic therapy in preclinical models and clinical
studies (8–10, 15–18). Levels of mature CECs typically change

in patients treated with antiangiogenic or vasculature-targeting agents (8, 15–17). We have also observed that among
patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors, changes in
CECs were a marker of clinical beneﬁt for patients treated
with the multitargeted kinase inhibitor sunitinib (8).
Not speciﬁc to cancer, CECs occur during pathologic conditions such as vasculitis (19), infection (20), and myocardial
infarction (21). There is an unmet need to identify CEC
populations that more precisely reﬂect the presence of, or
changes in, tumor vasculature. Global analysis of altered gene
expression patterns in endothelial cells from human colorectal
cancer tissues revealed a series of genes termed tumor endothelial markers (TEM; ref. 22). Since being ﬁrst described, TEMs
have received considerable attention as potential markers or
targets of tumor vasculature. Further studies have indicated
that some TEM expression may not be limited to the tumor
vasculature. In addition to TEMs, published reports have
indicated that CD276 (B7-H3), a leukocyte costimulatory molecule, may be overexpressed by endothelial cells during pathologic but not physiologic angiogenesis (23).
We hypothesized that a subset of CECs may originate from
tumor endothelium sloughed into peripheral circulation, and
that such CECs could be distinguished from CECs derived from
other sources by the presence of TEMs. Here, we evaluated
CECs in both murine models of human NSCLC and patients
with esophageal carcinoma. Our data suggest that speciﬁc
subpopulations of CECs bear TEMs, and circulating TEMþ
endothelial cells (CTEC) may be useful as blood-based markers
for detecting the presence of cancer or monitoring response to
therapies that affect the tumor vasculature.

Mice
Athymic nude mice (Ncr-nu) were purchased from the
National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and
Development Center (Frederick, MD). C57BL/6 mice were
bought from Charles River Laboratories. All animals were
housed under pathogen-free conditions in facilities approved
by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and in accordance with current regulations and standards of the United States Department of
Agriculture and NIH. At the time of the studies, the nude mice
were 8 to 10 weeks old and the C57BL/6 mice were 6 to 8 weeks
old.

Flow cytometric analysis of circulating endothelial cells
in human specimens
For human specimens, CTEC and CEC/CEP populations
were evaluated by eight-color ﬂow cytometry. The following
antibodies were used: CD276-PE (R&D Systems), CD146PerCP-Cy5 (Beckman Coulter), CD31-PECy7 (BD Biosciences),
CD133-APC (Miltenyi Biotec), and CD45-APC-Cy7(eBiosciences). Syto16 (Molecular Probes) was used as a nuclear
stain to identify nucleated cells and exclude debris, platelets,
and macroparticles. It was not used to distinguish between
apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells. Cells were gated on the basis
of side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) to display major
blood components of the Syto16þ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Antibodies directed against CD45 were
used to exclude hematopoietic cells. CD133 antibodies were
used to identify progenitor cells. Endothelial cells were identiﬁed with antibodies against CD146 and CD31. CECs were
identiﬁed as CD45/CD133/CD146þ/CD31þ. CEPs were
identiﬁed as CD45/CD133þ/CD146þ/CD31þ. CTECs were
identiﬁed as CD45/CD133/CD146þ/CD31þ/CD276þ. To
establish absolute CEC counts, the volume of blood analyzed
was determined by using the lymphocyte or monocyte counts
obtained from the patients' differential white cell counts. The
gating strategy from a representative human blood specimen is
shown in Supplementary Fig. S2.

Flow cytometric analysis of circulating endothelial cells
in mice
For both humans and mice, CECs in peripheral blood were
evaluated by ﬂow cytometry as previously described (24, 25).
Red cell lysis was performed using FACSLyse solution (BD

Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's directions, and 100 mL
of blood was analyzed for each mouse. The following directly
conjugated antibodies were used for detection of CECs and
CEPs in peripheral blood in mouse: anti-mouse CD45-PerCP,
Flk-1-Alexa 700 (mouse VEGFR-2), CD31-APC (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1), and CD117-PE-Cy7 (c-kit
receptor; all from BD Biosciences). Syto 16 (Molecular
Probes) was used as a nuclear stain to identify nucleated
cells and exclude debris, platelets, and macroparticles. It was
not used to distinguish between apoptotic and nonapoptotic
cells (24). As previously described, in mice CECs were
characterized as CD31þCD45VEGFR-2þCD117, and CEPs
as CD31þCD45VEGFR-2þCD117þ (7). For detection of
CD276, cells were stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated CD276 antibodies. For detection of TEM7, cells were
stained with biotin-conjugated TEM7 antibodies and Texas
red-conjugated streptavidin. Flow cytometry was done using
a FACSCanto ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and acquired
data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star) with
analysis gates designed to remove residual platelets and
cellular debris. For each mouse, a minimum of 100,000
events were typically counted. MS-1 cells, a transformed
murine endothelial cell line isolated from pancreatic islets of
C57BL/6 mice, were used as a positive control for endothelial cells. The gating strategy from a representative mouse
blood specimen is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.

of 300 mm3, mice were stratiﬁed into treatment groups of 5
animals per group. Animals received vehicle (91% polysorbate
80) by oral gavage or the VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 inhibitor
AZD2171 (6 mg/kg; gavage) daily for 14 days. For VEGF
treatment, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg of
recombinant human VEGF (National Cancer Institute, Biological Resources Branch, Bethesda, MD) daily for 5 days. Bevacizumab was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 10
mg/kg twice weekly.
Animals were weighed weekly and tumor volume was measured twice weekly. After treatment, mice were given isoﬂurane anesthesia, and blood was collected by retro-orbital puncture and anticoagulated using 0.5 mol/L EDTA. After mice were
euthanized, tumors were harvested and frozen in OCT embedding medium (Sakura Finetek).
Immunohistochemistry
Frozen tumor sections were ﬁxed in acetone for 10 minutes
and washed three times with PBS. Sections were blocked for
1 hour with 5% normal horse serum and 1% normal goat serum
in PBS and incubated with primary antibodies TEM7 (1:1000;
Imgenex), TEM8 (1:500; Abcam), and CD276 (1:1000;
eBioscience) overnight at 4 C. Slides were washed with PBS
and incubated with secondary antibody Alexa 488 (1:600,
Molecular Probes) for 1 hour at room temperature.
For double staining, each slide was washed with PBS and
incubated with antibodies directed against CD31 (1:500, BD
Biosciences) or smooth muscle actin (Dako) at 4 C overnight.
After being washed with PBS, slides were incubated with
secondary antibody Alexa 594 (1:600, Molecular Probes) for
1 hour at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained using 4,6diamididino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories).
Isolation of endothelial cells
Endothelial cells were isolated from tumor xenografts by
using a Magnetic Cell Sorting (MACS) system (Miltenyi Biotec).
Tumors were excised when they reached approximately 1 cm in
diameter. Normal endothelial cells were obtained from excised
skin, lung, liver, and epididymal fat pads of the same mice.
Excised tissue was minced and digested with collagenase II
(Worthington). Blood cells were removed by single sucrose stepgradient centrifugation with Histopaque 1077 (Sigma-Aldrich),
and cell suspensions were ﬁltered. Endothelial cells were isolated using ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antiCD31 antibody and the MACS system according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD31-positive cells were sorted, and
the purity of endothelial cells was conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometric
analysis of cell surface protein FITC-conjugated BS1-B4.
Human subjects
Following Institutional Review Board approval, written
informed consents were obtained from all the study participants. Forty consecutive patients, treated surgically at MD
Anderson Cancer Center for esophageal and NSCLC, were
enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria for this study included
any condition that deemed a patient unsatisfactory for surgery
after the preanesthetic evaluation and patients from which the
complete tumor resection was not possible. All patients were

followed until death or for a period of 5 years postoperatively.
The clinical characteristics are presented in (Table 1). All
patients had blood drawn before and one month after surgery.
Blood samples were also obtained from a group of nine healthy
volunteers for comparison analysis. The peripheral blood was
collected in heparin tubes using a vacutainer system. All the
samples were processed within 2 hours from the time of
collection. PBMCs were isolated using density centrifugation
over Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Then, the cells were resuspended in cell-freezing
medium (20% dimethyl sulfoxide, 80% RPMI-1640) and stored
in liquid nitrogen until the day of analysis. Baseline and followup samples for each patient were analyzed together to minimize inter assay variability.
Statistical analysis
For animal studies, Mann–Whitney test was used to compare differences in CTECs, CECs, and CEPs between treatment
groups. Mann–Whitney test was used to compare differences
in CTECs/ECs between patients with cancer and healthy
volunteers. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to look at
changes in those values in terms of absolute differences
between the samples collected before and after surgery. Correlation between CTECs cell counts and tumor size was
determined by Spearman rho correlation test. Survival was
analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method.

Results
Expression of tumor endothelial markers
As a ﬁrst step toward assessing whether TEMs could be
detected on tumor-derived CECs, we evaluated the effect of
expression of various TEMs and CD276 on the vasculature of
normal tissue and LLC tumor tissue in the C57BL/6 mouse
model by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1). The immunoreactivity of TEMs was detectable in all tumor tissues and was
absent or minimally detectable in normal lung tissue with the
exception of TEM5, which was expressed on endothelium
from both tumor and normal tissues in our analysis. TEM
expression was also absent in normal skin from mice (data not
shown). TEM7, TEM8, and CD276 colocalized with CD31,
suggesting that their expression is primarily limited to the
tumor endothelium (Fig. 1), although some staining of perivascular cells was noted for TEM7. TEM1 and TEM4 exhibited
considerable expression in tumor pericytes, which was conﬁrmed by double staining with the smooth muscle marker
actin (data not shown). Our observation that TEM1 and TEM5
are expressed on perivascular cells and normal endothelium,
respectively, is consistent with previous reports (23, 26). These
results indicated that the expression of most TEMs was
relatively tumor speciﬁc and that for some TEMs expression
was not limited to tumor endothelial cells. TEM7, TEM8, and
CD276 seemed to be the most promising markers based on
these immunohistochemical results.
Expression of TEMs on endothelial cells isolated from
normal and tumor tissues assessed using ﬂow cytometry
Using ﬂow cytometry, we next investigated whether TEMs
could be detected on endothelial cells isolated from tumor

tissue or normal tissue. In preliminary studies, we identiﬁed
antibodies against TEM7 and CD276, but not TEM8, which
were suitable for use in ﬂow cytometry. Murine endothelial
cells were puriﬁed from both the normal and tumor-derived
tissues of H1975 xenografts using CD31-immunomagnetic
beads. The purity of endothelial cells was conﬁrmed using the
FITC-conjugated cell surface protein BSI-B4.
CTECs were deﬁned on the basis of the presence of CEC
markers (CD31þCD45VEGFR-2þCD117; ref. 7) as well as
CD276 or TEM7 immunoreactivity. CD276 or TEM7 immunoreactivity was detected in 6% to 10% of total endothelial
cells from normal skin or lung tissue, and in 30% and 22%,
respectively, of tumor endothelial cells (Fig. 2). Because
CD276 expression on liver endothelium has previously been
described (27), liver endothelial cells were included in our
analysis. Consistent with earlier reports, CD276 was detectable in 84% of liver endothelial cells, but TEM7 was detectable in only 4% (Fig. 2A). Therefore, TEM7 and CD276
endothelial cells could be detected on tumor endothelial
cells by ﬂow cytometry, and the expression of CD276 could

We used blood from mice bearing H1975 human NSCLC
xenografts to test our hypothesis that the number of CTECs
would be higher in tumor-bearing than nontumor-bearing
mice. As previously described, CECs and CEPs were characterized as CD31þCD45VEGFR-2þCD117 and CD31þ
CD45VEGFR-2þCD117þ, respectively (7, 9, 17, 28, 29). We
refer to the CECs coexpressing TEM7 and CD276 as TEM7
CTECs and CD276 CTECs, respectively. We found that levels
of CECs and CEPs were higher in tumor-bearing than non–
tumor-bearing mice, although the differences were not significant (P ¼ 0.41 and 0.26, respectively). In contrast, the numbers
of CD276 CTECs and TEM7 CTECs were signiﬁcantly increased
in the blood of tumor-bearing mice compared with the controls (P ¼ 0.041 and 0.032, respectively; Fig. 2B), demonstrating
relative speciﬁcity of CTECs for the presence of tumor. In this

to stimuli other than cancer, including ischemia, infection,
and organ regeneration, and in response to proangiogenic
factors such as VEGF and SDF-1a (13, 24, 28, 30–39). Using
H1975 xenografts, we examined the impact of VEGF injection
or the presence of tumors on different endothelial cell populations. The number of TEM7 CTECs in tumor-bearing mice was
signiﬁcantly higher than that in nontumor-bearing mice that
had (VEGF treated) or had not (control) received a VEGF
injection (P ¼ 0.018 and 0.020, respectively; Fig. 3A). The level
of CD276 CTECs was also signiﬁcantly higher in tumor-bearing
than nontumor-bearing control mice (P ¼ 0.015). In contrast,
levels of CECs and CEPs were not signiﬁcantly higher in tumorbearing mice than in control or VEGF-treated mice, suggesting
that CTECs had greater speciﬁcity for the presence of tumor
than CECs or CEPs did.

Detection of CTECs in clinical specimens
To investigate whether CECs and CTECs could be detected
in patients with cancer and were associated with the presence
of cancer, we investigated CTECs in patients before and after
resection of their tumor. The cancer patient group was composed of 22 (55%) patients with esophageal cancer and 18 (44%)
with lung cancer with a mean age of 60  10.45 and 64  9.28,
respectively. Twenty-seven patients received induction chemotherapy, 19 patients with esophageal carcinoma and 8 with lung
carcinoma. The tumor was successfully resected in all patients.
There was no postoperative mortality. Eighteen patients had
recurrence in the course of their follow-up (Table 1). The
control group of normal healthy volunteers consists of 9
patients, 6 men and 3 women, ages from 22 to 58 years (median
52 years). Although the primary goal of this analysis was to
assess changes in CEC and CTECs after resection, we ﬁrst
explored the levels of CECs and CTEC in patients with esophageal and lung cancer compared with normal volunteers.
CTECs (CD45CD133CD276þ) were present at signiﬁcantly
higher levels in patients with cancer (P < 0.001; Fig. 4A). This
was true for both patients with lung and those with esophageal
cancer (Fig. 4A). Consistent with earlier studies, mature CECs
(CD45CD133CD31þ) were present at a higher level in
patients than in healthy volunteers, although this difference
was not signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.13). CTECs were elevated in patients
with cancer compared with healthy volunteers regardless of
whether they received induction chemotherapy (Fig. 4B). Given
the limited size of the normal control group, however, this
analysis was merely exploratory.
To investigate whether CTEC counts decreased following
surgery, we analyzed blood samples collected before and one
month following surgery in the same group of patients. We
observed a signiﬁcant decrease in patient CTEC levels following surgical removal of the tumor (P < 0.001; Fig. 5A). The effect

CTECs as surrogate markers for antiangiogenic activity
We next examined whether CTECs may serve as markers
of angiogenesis inhibitor activity, as has been previously
reported for CECs and CEPs (7, 8, 16, 17, 24, 29, 40). We
injected mice with H1975 tumor cells subcutaneously, and
once tumors reached a volume of 300 mm3, the animals were
treated with vehicle only or with the VEGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor AZD2171 (cediranib) or sunitinib, or the human
VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. After 2 weeks of
treatment, tumor growth was inhibited by 77% to 83% in
each treatment arm compared with vehicle-only controls
(Fig. 3B). The levels of CECs, CEPs, TEM7 CTECs, and CD276
CTECs in the collected blood were measured by ﬂow cytometry. We found that each of the three inhibitors decreased
the number of these cell types, although the degree of
reduction varied. Reduced levels of CD276 CTECs (relative
to control) were signiﬁcantly correlated with the reductions
in tumor growth (R2 ¼ 0.96, P < 0.05).

was similar whether the patients had lung or esophageal
cancer but more pronounced with lung cancer (Fig. 5E). This
postsurgical decrease in CTECs was observed regardless of
whether patients received induction chemotherapy (Fig. 5B).
This pattern was preserved if the patients had a recurrence
(Fig. 5D). Patients who had induction therapy responded in a
similar fashion after surgery, indicating that despite the clinical
response, surgery decreased the counts even further (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
CECs (41) are known to consist of at least two distinct
populations: bone marrow-derived CEPs (42), which may
contribute to pathologic neovascularization, and mature CECs
derived from existing mature vasculature. CECs have emerged
as a potentially useful biomarker for highly vascular and
angiogenic tumors (7, 9, 16, 17). Increased levels of CECs have
been observed in patients with cancer relative to normal
subjects and have been associated with disease progression
(43, 44). In murine models, VEGF pathway inhibitors can have
differential effects on mature CECs and CEPs in that inhibition
of tumor angiogenesis is associated with an initial increase in
mature CECs (7), followed by a subsequent reduction. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that CECs can be used as a
surrogate marker for therapeutic activity of antiangiogenic
agents (9, 29, 45). In a previous study of patients with breast
cancer receiving metronomic chemotherapy, an increase in
apoptotic CECs, presumably being shed from the tumor vasculature, was shown to correlate with clinical beneﬁt (16).
Despite these discoveries, the clinical application of CECs as a
cancer-speciﬁc biomarker is limited, at least in part, because
CECs and CEPs have been shown to increase in response
to stimuli other than cancer, including pathologic conditions
(e.g., infection, ischemia, and sickle cell anemia) and physiologic conditions (e.g., pregnancy and menstrual cycles), or in
response to pro-angiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF and SDF-1a)
(13, 24, 28, 30–39).
In an effort to identify more speciﬁc markers reﬂecting
tumor vasculature, we investigated subpopulations of CECs

www.aacrjournals.org

bearing tumor endothelial cell-speciﬁc markers, which we
term CTECs. In an earlier study by St. Croix and colleagues.
(22), 46 TEMs were identiﬁed by isolating the endothelial cells
in human colorectal tumors by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), and further studies on a subset of TEMs (TEM1–
TEM9) revealed their highly elevated levels speciﬁcally in the
angiogenic state (22). Subsequent studies demonstrated counterparts of many of these TEMs in mice (23, 46, 47). Consistent
with these earlier studies, we observed tumor endothelial
staining for TEM8 and CD276 in our murine cancer models
(23, 46). Prior studies of TEM7 have shown more varied results.
Expression in human tumor endothelium has been observed in
a number of studies (22, 23, 48, 49). In mouse studies, however,
TEM7 expression was demonstrated by real-time PCR in one
study of human melanoma and liposarcoma xenografts (47)
but not observed in syngeneic melanoma tumors or human
colon cancer xenografts by in situ hybridization or by SAGE
analysis (23, 46). These differences may be, in part, due to the
different methodologies used (e.g., SAGE, which identiﬁes
differentially expressed gene transcripts vs. immunohistochemistry, and ﬂow cytometry, which evaluates protein
levels of TEM7). Furthermore, given that vascular beds from
different sites are morphologically and functionally distinct
(50), our preclinical ﬁndings may be inﬂuenced by the fact that
the tumors were grown subcutaneously. In addition, because
tumor cells can inﬂuence tumor-associated endothelial cells
though paracrine signaling, differences between the preclinical
studies may also be due to differences in the tumor models
used (23).
TEM8, a cell-surface glycoprotein identiﬁed as an anthrax
toxin receptor, is also upregulated on tumor vessels in mouse
and human cancers (46, 51). In TEM8 knockout mice, developmental angiogenesis and wound healing occur normally,
whereas tumor growth is impaired, indicating that TEM8 may
be required for tumor angiogenesis but not for physiologic
vascular processes (52, 53). In preclinical cancer models,
targeting of TEM8 inhibited tumor angiogenesis and tumor
growth (53).

Figure 5. Evaluation CTECs in patients with esophageal and lung cancer. A, levels of CTECs decreased in patients following surgical removal of the tumor
(P < 0.001). B, this postsurgical decrease in CTECs was observed with or without induction chemotherapy. C, this pattern was preserved if the patients had a
recurrence (D) or if they had a clinical response. E, levels of CTEC in patients who had esophagectomy (N ¼ 22) and those who had resection for lung cancer
(N ¼ 18).

Expression of CD276, a leukocyte costimulatory molecule,
on endothelial cells has been evaluated previously. Using
mouse models and comprehensive SAGE analysis, CD276 was
identiﬁed as being expressed during pathologic but not physiologic angiogenesis (23). CD276 levels are elevated in colon
and lung tumors compared with normal tissue, and although
the tumor cells themselves expressed low levels of CD276,
tumor-associated endothelial cells expressed high levels of
CD276 (23).
Consistent with prior reports, in our initial immunohistochemical analysis of Lewis lung cancer xenograft tissue, we
found that with the exception of TEM5, TEMs were present at
higher levels in these tumors than in normal tissues (skin and
lung). In some cases, localization was not exclusively limited to
tumor endothelial cells, for example, immunoreactivity for
TEM1, TEM4, TEM7, and CD276 was also detected in perivascular cells in tumors. Consistent with earlier reports, CD276
was also expressed in normal liver endothelium (27).
To further investigate whether TEMs could be detected on
endothelial cells isolated from tumor or normal tissue, we used

2738

Cancer Res; 74(10) May 15, 2014

four-color ﬂow cytometry with a panel of established antibodies (24, 54). As expected, endothelial cells isolated from
tumors expressed signiﬁcantly higher levels than endothelial
cells detected from normal skin and lung tissues but not
normal liver tissue, the endothelial cells of which expressed
high levels of CD276.
We next examined whether we could detect CTECs in the
blood of mice. We found that CTECs, but not CECs or CEPs,
were present at signiﬁcantly higher levels in tumor-bearing
mice than in nontumor-bearing mice or, for TEM7 CTECs,
mice treated with VEGF. This ﬁnding suggested that CTECs are
relatively more speciﬁc for tumors than CECs or CEPs are and
relatively less responsive to a proangiogenic stimulus (i.e.,
VEGF) in the absence of tumor. As a subpopulation of CECs,
CTECs may provide information distinct from that of CEPs or
CECs. This difference may be due to CTECs being derived in
part from the shedding of fragile, mature endothelium from
tumor vasculature into the circulation, whereas CEPs are
mobilized from the bone marrow in response to a variety of
proangiogneic stimuli, such as VEGF, and subsequently

differentiate into mature CECs. It is worth noting, however,
that a low level of CTECs was detected in nontumor-bearing
mice. The source of these cells is not clear but, given that TEMs
are relatively but not perfectly speciﬁc for tumor endothelial
cells, this may reﬂect a true population of rare TEMþ endothelial cells in nontumor-bearing mice or alternatively a small
degree of antibody cross-reactivity.
To address whether the increase in CTECs occurred after
treatment with agents thought to selectively reduce tumor
angiogenesis, we tested the effect of the VEGF pathway inhibitors AZD7121 (cediranib), sunitnib, and bevacizumab in our
H1971 xenograft mouse model. Each of these agents decreased
the number of CTECs as well as CECs and CEPs. The reduction
of all three types correlated with decreased tumor volume. An
antiangiogenic agent may affect these cell populations differently; for instance, an angiogenic inhibitor could reduce VEGFinduced CEP mobilization but increase mature CEC and CTEC
shedding. Additional studies are needed to determine whether
these changes could serve as markers of biologic activity.
Finally, we observed that in both NSCLC and esophageal
cancer patients, CTEC levels decreased signiﬁcantly after
resection. A postresection decrease was observed both in
patients who had previously received induction chemotherapy
and those who did not, suggesting that CTEC changes were not
merely changes induced by chemotherapy, as previously
observed for CECs (55). We also observed that CTECs are
present in patients with both NSCLC and esophageal cancer at
levels higher than normal, healthy control subjects but given
the small size of this control group (N ¼ 9), this ﬁnding is
hypothesis generating and larger studies would be needed to
more thoroughly evaluate the potential use of CTECs for the
detection of cancer.
On the basis of the ﬁndings presented here, CTECs may be an
appealing marker for several reasons. CTECs are more speciﬁc
for cancer than CECs and CEPs and less inﬂuenced by nonmalignant stimuli. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are also
speciﬁc for cancer but, unlike CTCs, it seems that a limited
number of TEMs are present on the majority of tumor endothelium although the number of different tumor types whose
TEMs have been characterized is limited. In theory, therefore,
CTECs may be more cancer speciﬁc than CECs and a limited
number of TEM markers on CECs could cover the vast majority
of tumor types. More studies are needed to determine the
clinical utility of CTECs.

The current study indicated that TEMs and CD276 are
potentially useful diagnostic and prognostic markers for lung
and esophageal cancer. CTECs are detectable and are found in
increased numbers in tumor-bearing mice than in nontumorbearing mice. We propose that CTECs derive from endothelial
cells shed from the tumor and that they are a novel cancerspeciﬁc subset of CECs and, given the number of nonmalignant
conditions that can inﬂuence CEC levels, may be more useful
than CECs for detecting tumors. However, many questions
pertaining to TEMs remain and will need to be addressed in
future mechanistic and prospective clinical studies.
