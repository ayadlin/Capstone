Summary

Author Manuscript

Tissue growth is the multifaceted outcome of a cell’s intrinsic capabilities and its interactions with
the surrounding environment. Decoding these complexities is essential for understanding human
development and tumorigenesis. Here, we tackle this problem by carrying out the first genomewide RNAi-mediated screens in mice. Focusing on skin development and oncogenic (HrasG12Vinduced) hyperplasia, our screens uncover novel as well as anticipated regulators of embryonic
epidermal growth. Among top oncogenic screen hits are Mllt6 and the Wnt effector β-catenin; they
maintain HrasG12V-dependent hyperproliferation. We also expose β-catenin as an unanticipated
antagonist of normal epidermal growth, functioning through Wnt-independent intercellular
adhesion. Finally, we document physiological relevance to mouse and human cancers, thereby
establishing the feasibility of in vivo mammalian genome-wide investigations to dissect tissue
development and tumorigenesis. By documenting some oncogenic growth regulators, we pave the
way for future investigations of other hits and raise promise for unearthing new targets for cancer
therapies.
Genome-wide cellular RNAi screening has advanced the identification of genes involved in
oncogenic growth control. To date, however, high throughput screens in mammalian cells
have been limited to cultures, which even for the best systems, incompletely model
physiological environments. We’ve overcome this impediment by devising methods to
efficiently and selectively transduce murine epidermis through in utero lentiviral targeting of
progenitors in E9.5 embryos1. When coupled with shRNA expression, lentiviral

transduction is stably propagated throughout skin epithelium, resulting in RNAi-mediated
reductions in target transcript and protein levels. This enables rapid analysis of complex
genetic pathways in mammals, something previously only possible in lower eukaryotes2-4.

Author Manuscript

The correlation between a tissue’s growth and turnover rates and its susceptibility to cancer
makes embryonic epidermis an attractive model for exploring how rapidly growing tissues
balance proliferation and differentiation, and what prevents them from doing so in tumor
progression. Given the efficacy of our system to single gene studies, we’ve now expanded
this scale by >four orders of magnitude to conduct genome-wide RNAi screens. Our
objectives were to first, demonstrate the feasibility of such screens in mammals; second,
identify epidermal growth regulators in their native, physiological environment; third
uncover how epidermal growth control changes when it is propelled by a well-known
oncogene; and fourth, demonstrate the implications of our findings for tumor progression in
mice and humans.

Epidermal growth is rapid and uniform
Following completion of gastrulation and continuing to birth, mouse surface ectoderm
commences rapid growth to match embryo expansion (Fig. 1a). Beginning as a monolayer,
E9.5 ectoderm differentiates into a stratified, multi-layered epidermis that by birth
constitutes a barrier that retains fluids and excludes microbes. Mature epidermis maintains
an inner progenitor layer, which fuels tissue homeostasis and wound repair.

Author Manuscript

To quantify epidermal growth, we randomly marked single cells at clonal density by
infecting E9.5 Rosa26lox-stop-lox-yfp Cre-reporter embryos (r26yfp/+)5 with an LV-Cre
lentivirus1, and then monitored their expansion during development (Fig. 1b). By E18.5,
single YFP+ cells at E10.5 had grown to clones constituting ~40 cells (Fig. 1b,c; ~5-6
divisions/cell). Variability in clone size ranged within 1-2 cell divisions, indicating
strikingly uniform growth throughout the epidermis.
We next examined how growth is affected by oncogenic Hras1, found mutated in many
cancers and the primary target in skin carcinogenesis models6,7. K14-Cre8 driven,
epidermal-specific expression of G12V-Hras from its endogenous locus
(HrasLox-WT-STOP-Lox-G12V)9 resulted in mice whose skin displayed epidermal overgrowth
as well as oncogenic Hras dose-dependency for one (K14-Cre; HrasLSL-G12V/+; HrasoncoX1)
or two copies (K14-Cre; HrasLSL-G12V/LSL-G12V; HrasoncoX2) (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Additional distinctions included expansion of both progenitors (keratin 5+) and
differentiating layers (spinous, keratin 10+; granular, filaggrin+) (Supplementary Figs. 1-3).

Author Manuscript

To quantify the impact of oncogenic Hras on epidermal growth, we used a Cellular Growth
Index (CGI) assay1 (Fig. 1d). Cre-reporter (r26yfp/+) embryos, transduced with LV-Cre and
RFP-expressing lentivirus (LV-RFP) mix showed similar relative numbers of YFP+ to RFP+
keratinocytes across several embryos, indicating that control YFP+ and RFP+ populations
grew at comparable rates (Fig. 1e,f). Transduction of the same lentiviral mixture into test
animals (where Cre-transduction induces HrasG12V) revealed consistently more YFP+
(HrasG12V) than RFP+ (control) cells (CGIs=1.82, one copy; 3.32, two copies HrasG12V;

Figs. 1e,f). These findings demonstrate that HrasG12V confers a dose-dependent growth
advantage to skin epidermis and that growth rates can be documented and quantified.
HrasG12V not only conferred a dose-dependent increase in proliferation, but also in
suppression of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 4). Additionally, consistent with established
pro-inflammatory effects of HrasG12V, innate and adaptive immune cells infiltrated
underlying dermis. Lastly, real-time PCR revealed no evidence for oncogenic induction of
cellular senescence-associated CDK inhibitors10.

Establishing pooled screen parameters

Author Manuscript

Based upon the principle of our CGI assay, we expected that following epidermal
transduction with a pool of shRNA-expressing lentivirus, any shRNA that targets an
essential mediator of growth will be reduced or lost during development, while shRNAs
targeting negative growth regulators will become overrepresented. By comparing relative
shRNA abundance in the initial pool and at E18.5, we expected to identify shRNAs and their
targets that confer either growth advantage or disadvantage.

Author Manuscript

The success of the approach depended upon our ability to: a) modify growth at a low
Multiplicity of Infection (MOI ≤ 1), b) measure individual shRNA abundance in the pool, c)
transduce embryonic epidermis at an MOI ≤ 1, and d) achieve complete screen coverage,
where every shRNA in the pool is tested. We set up a series of controls to ensure that these
parameters are met. Underscoring the feasibility of pooled-formats for in vivo RNAi screens,
we demonstrated that targeting of a) anaphase promoting complex component Anapc5
during normal growth, and b) Hras1 during oncogenic hyperplasia, significantly reduced
average clone sizes, even with transductions where most cells harbored only a single shRNA
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
To quantify individual shRNA representation in a complex pool, we used the Illumina-based
count-by-sequencing principle (Supplementary Fig. 6). We designed oligonucleotides to
amplify the target sequence of each shRNA, and optimized pre-amplification and clean-up
pipelines to yield a product to apply directly to the sequencing cell. We tested our protocol
against a defined template generated by combining genomic DNAs from independently
transduced cell lines, so that individual genome-integrated shRNAs were present in amounts
corresponding from a single cell (6pg) up to 2,048 cells (12.3ng).

Author Manuscript

We amplified and sequenced this standard set, and showed that reactions were: a)
quantitative, with increased sequencing reads corresponding to shRNA abundance in the
pool, b) sensitive, detecting all three single-copy shRNAs, and c) highly reproducible
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Independent counts of the standard set showed identical sequencing
bias for a given shRNA, and thus became neutralized in relative comparisons of absolute
counts, especially with ≥32 copies of the shRNA. Indeed, a >30-fold screen coverage proved
sufficient to sample all shRNAs in our pool (see below). At this level, growth-neutral
shRNAs were >1,000-fold represented in the E18.5 sequencing quantification reaction, since
each E9.5 epidermal cell generates ~40 cells by E18.5.

We next determined that at an infection level of 13-27%, most transduced epidermal
keratinocytes carried a single lentivirus (MOI≤1) (Supplementary Fig. 7). To ensure that at
least 30 individual cells were infected with each shRNA at E9.5, a pool of ~78,000 shRNAs
required ~106 cells to be targeted. We used high-resolution imaging of TOPRO3-labeled
embryos and established that at E9.5, surface ectoderm contained ≥120,000 cells/embryo.
Together, this suggested that transducing ≥90 embryos would achieve the requisite coverage
(Supplementary Fig. 8).

Screens identify known growth regulators

Author Manuscript

We pooled the genome-wide collection of murine shRNA lentiviruses in roughly equal
concentrations11, and profiled the starting composition of the pool (t=0), in transduced
primary mouse keratinocytes (Fig. 2a). Physiological screens were performed in control and
HrasoncoX2 embryos transduced at E9.5 in utero (Fig. 2b). Epidermal cells were collected
after 24hrs (initial pool) and 9d of development, and integrated lentiviral hairpins from
genomic DNAs were sequenced and quantified (Fig. 2c).

Author Manuscript

Our pre-amplification and sequencing reactions did not bias shRNA quantification, and
Illumina sequencing reads were of high quality. They mapped to the shRNA library with
predictable efficiency and indicated complete coverage of the pool (Supplementary Fig.
9,10). Significantly altered shRNAs were identified and ranked based on two independent
methods. To ensure reproducibility, we used DESeq statistical package12, which accounted
for biological variability among our replicates (sets of 30 embryos/condition) and is the best
method to identify candidates per se (Fig. 2d-k). However, informative yet variable shRNAs
can be excluded by the high stringency of DESeq, which reduces the ability to control for
off-target effects by requiring that multiple shRNAs show consistent behavior. We therefore
also analyzed pooled data sets (90 embryos/condition; Supplementary Fig. 11) using
Fisher’s exact test, which reduces variability by averaging individual shRNA abundance. By
maximizing screen coverage, this method produces a more inclusive list of significantly
altered shRNAs, and hence was preferred for ranking candidates identified by DESeq (Fig.
2f,j,k). Importantly, the overlap between these approaches was extensive (Supplementary
Fig. 11), underscoring the robustness of our data.

Author Manuscript

We identified ~1,800 genes as essential for normal growth (Fig. 2d,e, Supplementary Table
1,2), and were significantly enriched for function in protein synthesis (P=3.1E-10) and gene
expression (P=2.6E-10). Genes encoding 60S and 40S ribosomal proteins were also highly
represented and among the top 10% of all hits for normal growth, underscoring our screen’s
power to identify regulators of normal growth/viability (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 12).
Indeed our top 10 candidates for regulators of normal growth featured six ribosomal genes
and two genes essential for mRNA splicing (Fig. 2j).
In our screen for specific regulators of HrasG12V-dependent oncogenic growth, ~160 genes
surfaced as candidates (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Table 3,4). They diverged in identity and
function from those implicated in normal growth regulation, as most housekeeping growth
regulators were eliminated by pair-wise comparison of control and HrasoncoX2 shRNA
abundance (Fig. 2h). The oncogene-specific regulators included Hras1, and downstream Ras

pathway members Raf1, MEKs, and Akts (Fig. 2i). Equally notable was the absence of
upstream oncogenic Ras regulators, e.g. guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and
GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which are not expected to arise in a screen for hairpins
suppressing HrasG12V-induced growth. Our top 10 hits for regulators of oncogenic growth
included well-established Ras pathway members Akt3 and Raf1, as well as the Ras-regulated
Pawr13 (Fig. 2k). Cyclin C (Ccnc), a putative regulator of hematopoietic stem cell
quiescence14 was also on this list, as was Mllt6, encoding an MLL translocation partner in
acute leukemia and a component of an epigenetic modifier complex15.

Author Manuscript

The very top candidate for preferential regulation of oncogenic growth was Ctnnb1,
encoding the Wnt signaling and intercellular adhesion effector β-catenin. At first glance, βcatenin seemed obvious, as its over-activation has been implicated in a variety of cancers,
including those of skin16-18. However, β-catenin is also thought to be essential for stem
cells19. Hence, it was surprising that its hairpins surfaced in a screen for selective inhibitors
of oncogenic and not normal growth. Even more paradoxical was that in our parallel
genome-wide screen, Ctnnb1 was the top candidate for negative regulation of normal
epidermal growth (Supplementary Table 1,2).

Validating oncogene-specific regulators

Author Manuscript

We chose Ctnnb1 and Mllt6 for further study. For both Ctnnb1 and Mllt6, a direct
correlation was observed between transcript knockdown in vitro and severity of growth
defects in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 13), strongly arguing against off-target effects. We
validated our candidates as oncogenic growth regulators with a modified in vivo CGI assay
involving two lentiviral vectors (Fig. 3a). In one, Cre-recombinase fused to monomeric RFP
(LV-Cre::mRFP) contained a scrambled shRNA control. In the other vector, untagged Cre
was used; this vector encoded the test shRNA against the candidate. Transduction of E9.5
control or HrasoncoX2 Cre-reporter embryos marked two separate populations: RFP+YFP+
cells represented the baseline rate of normal (in control) or oncogenic growth (in
HrasoncoX2); YFP+ cells represented the rate of growth that occurs when the target transcript
is depleted.

Author Manuscript

The ratios of YFP+ cells normalized to YFP+RFP+ cells in HrasoncoX2 and control animals
revealed that two independent Ctnnb1 shRNAs displayed reductions of ~2-4-fold in
oncogenic relative to normal growth. Similar ~two-fold reductions in YFP+ cells were
observed in the HrasoncoX2 background when Mllt6 transcripts were diminished (Fig. 3b).
The physiological effects of Ctnnb1 or Mllt6 knockdown were profound: the neonatal
oncogenic phenotype was significantly ameliorated, and epidermal proliferation in
HrasoncoX2 embryos was markedly and reproducibly suppressed. By contrast, no significant
effects were seen on apoptosis (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 13).
Equally interesting to the selective effects of Ctnnb1 knockdown on suppressing HrasG12Vdependent oncogenic growth were its positive effects on normal growth. These differences
appeared physiologically significant, as they were reflected at the level of EdUincorporation and thickness of epidermal tissue (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 14). Although

hitherto overlooked, the proliferative effects of Ctnnb1 hairpins on normal epidermis are
recapitulated upon conditional targeting of β-catenin20,21.
β-Catenin is both an adherens junction component and a nuclear cofactor for Wnt-regulators
LEF/TCF and other DNA binding proteins22. However in contrast to its nuclear functions, βcatenin’s role in adhesion has been assumed to be redundant with plakoglobin23. Given that
intercellular defects can promote proliferation, we revisited this issue using a sensitive in
vitro adhesion assay (Fig. 3d-f, Supplementary Fig. 15)24. Despite plakoglobin upregulation,
Ctnnb1-null keratinocytes inefficiently formed cell-cell adhesions upon calcium induction.
Moreover, the Wnt inhibitor XAV93925 failed to phenocopy these defects. Finally,
consistent with the view that loss of β-catenin compromises contact-inhibition and leads to
cellular overgrowth, Ctnnb1-null cells were hyperproliferative and formed overgrown foci
upon reaching confluence.

Oncogenic growth and Wnt signaling
Although intercellular adhesion is often viewed as tumor-suppressive, Wnt signaling is often
associated with oncogenic growth. To test whether this might contribute to the negative
effects of Ctnnb1 knockdown on HrasG12V skins, we transduced embryos with both a Wntreporter and LV-Cre (Fig. 4a). In E18.5 control animals, reporter expression was predictably
restricted to developing hair follicles26 and largely abolished with concomitant Ctnnb1
knockdown.

Author Manuscript

Intriguingly, Wnt-reporter expression was expanded throughout transduced HrasoncoX2
interfollicular epidermis. Additionally, HrasG12V-expressing epidermis displayed ectopic
nuclear β-catenin and >6-fold upregulation of Axin2 transcripts (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Fig.
16a-c). Conversely, BMP signaling, which is antagonistic to Wnt signaling in skin27, was
downregulated in HrasGV12 epidermis, and was not rescued by β-catenin depletion,
suggesting its independence of Wnt in this oncogenenic context (Supplementary Fig. 18).

Author Manuscript

Mllt6 expression paralleled β-catenin and Wnt reporter activity, both in normal hair follicles
and in evaginating structures of HrasoncoX2 skin (Supplementary Fig. 16b). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis showed
that TCF3 and TCF4 bound to a conserved LEF/TCF motif upstream of Mllt6 (Fig. 4b). A
299bp segment (green line) encompassing this site drove LEF1/β-catenin-dependent
luciferase reporter activity in a manner comparable to the 331bp TCF3/4 binding site of
Axin2, an established Wnt-target gene (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Fig. 16d). In agreement,
depletion or loss of β-catenin in embryonic epidermis in vivo reduced Mllt6 transcript levels
(Fig. 4d).

β-catenin and Mllt6 in epidermal tumors
Although our screens were conducted on embryonic mouse skin, our findings showed
relevance to cancer. RNA-seq analysis revealed that Ctnnb1 or Mllt6 depletion in oncogenic
Hras epidermis affected a shared set of transcripts (P=2.48E-40 and P=8.16E-25) that
globally suppressed pathways promoting tumorigenesis (e.g. Myc, E2f1) and enhanced those
restricting growth (e.g. Trp53, Cdkn2a; Fig. 4e,f). Moreover in human squamous cell

carcinomas (SCC), β-catenin and Mllt6 were often upregulated and nuclear (notably in the
basal layer, where cancer stem cells reside28). Our analysis of 75 different human skin SCCs
showed that most tumors expressed both proteins, with significant correlation in their
expression (Supplementary Fig. 18). It remains to be seen whether their co-expression in
tumors and a shared effect on transcriptional profile during oncogenic growth reflects a
functional interaction between our candidates, or is a result of their independent effect/
importance on the cellular machinery at the heart of oncogenic growth.

Author Manuscript

We next tested whether β-catenin and Mllt6 are physiologically relevant to HrasG12Vdependent tumor initiation and maintenance. While clonal LV-Cre-mediated activation of
HrasG12V expression in mice resulted in squamous papilloma formation as early as three
weeks of age, concomitant constitutive expression of Ctnnb1 or Mllt6 shRNAs delayed
tumor initiation (Fig. 5a). Moreover, growth of orthotopically transplanted SCC cells was
significantly reduced following candidate depletion (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Fig. 19).
We extended this physiological relevance by performing xenografts of human SCC cells
transduced with lentivirus harboring scrambled or shRNAs targeting hCtnnb1 or hMllt6.
Tumor initiation was significantly delayed, with Mllt6 showing stronger effect than Ctnnb1
(Fig. 5c; Supplementary Fig. 19).

Author Manuscript

Finally, to assess whether Ctnnb1 and Mllt6 are required for tumor maintenance, we
engineered an LV-Cre vector that allows for doxycycline-regulated shRNA expression,
thereby enabling induced depletion of Mllt6 and Ctnnb1 following tumor formation in adult
animals (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 20). Both had negative effects on tumor maintenance,
with some tumors showing partial regression. Thus, the tumor-suppressive effects of Ctnnb1
and Mllt6 shRNAs as first revealed in embryogenesis appeared to be functionally relevant to
adult tumorigenesis.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The urgent need to understand cancer has fueled human cancer genome sequencing and in
vitro RNAi-based screening efforts to identify genes that preferentially affect cancer cells
but not their normal counterparts. While promising in concept, assay conditions and cell-line
histories can profoundly affect genes identified in these screens29,30. Although xenogeneic
transplantations of transduced human cells offer improvements31, they often incompletely
simulate carcinoma ontogeny, which depends upon complex interactions with local and
systemic environments. By targeting cells in their normal physiological context, we correct
these deficits and abrogate many caveats, including epigenetic, genetic, and stress-induced
alterations in gene expression, all of which introduce heterogeneity and increase coverage
requirements when cells are grown on plastic.
Our study accentuates a particular importance of β-catenin in promoting oncogenic effects,
since it surfaced at the top of >15,000 genes in our screen. Moreover, elevated Hras-MAPK
signaling drove β-catenin’s effects from negative to positive, since normal epidermal growth
was actually impeded by β-catenin. In this regard, it is interesting that leukemias also seem
to be more sensitive to activated β-catenin than their normal counterparts32. Our findings

further suggest that β-catenin’s ability to balance tissue growth is exerted through its
antagonistic functions in intercellular adhesion and transcriptional activation.
A myriad of new candidates from our screen await further investigation. Among them are
chromatin modifiers, which have been increasingly implicated in human cancers33. In this
regard, our validation of Mllt6 is intriguing, since MLL proteins are known to associate with
DotL1 H3K79-methyltransferase complexes34. Given Mllt6’s selective effects on oncogenic
growth, it is tempting to speculate that this protein might function by guiding its histone
modifier complex to a key cancer target gene(s). While detailed understanding of this and
other candidates awaits experimentation, our methodology paves the way for future studies
aimed at uncovering mechanisms of SCC progression, with the hope of identifying targets
that selectively compromise growth of one of the world’s most prevalent and lifethreatening cancers.

Methods
Lentivirus production and in vivo and in vitro transductions

Author Manuscript

Large-scale production and concentration of lentivirus were performed as previously
described1. Male and female animals was used in equal numbers, and all mice were on the
C57BL/6 background, including Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos/+ (Jackson Laboratories,
donated by A. McMahon), FR-HrasG12V (9), and Tg(K14-Cre)1Efu8. Mice were housed and
cared for in an AAALAC-accredited facility, and all animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with IACUC-approved protocols. Randomization and blinding were not used in
this study. Detailed description of the in vivo lentiviral transductions can be found
elsewhere1,35. For lentiviral infections in culture, cells were plated in 12-well dishes at
70,000 cells/well and incubated with lentivirus in the presence of polybrene (100 mg/ml)
overnight. After 2 days, infected cells were sorted based on RFP expression (mouse and
human SCC cells) or positively selected with puromycin (1 mg/ml) for 4 days and processed
for mRNA analysis.
mRNA quantifications

Author Manuscript

Total RNAs were isolated from FACS-sorted cells from E18.5 epidermis or from flashfrozen, pulverized kidney, using the Absolutely RNA Microprep kit (Stratagene). cDNAs
were generated from 1 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript Vilo cDNA synthesis kit (Life
Technologies). Real-Time PCR was performed using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems) and gene-specific and Ppib control primers. Real-time
experiments were done on cells isolated from 3 transduced animals, or 3 independently
transduced cell culture plates, and all reactions were performed in triplicate and in two
separate runs. BRE-Zs-Green activity was measured using Real-Time PCR with ZsGreen
specific primers on cDNA from transduced epidermal cells as previously described4.
Immunostaining and histological analyses
The following primary antibodies were used: chicken anti-GFP (1:2,000; Abcam); mouse
anti β-catenin (15B8, 1:1,000; Sigma); guinea pig: anti-K5 (1:500; E. Fuchs); rat anti-CD34
(RAM34, 1:100; eBioscience), anti-Ecad (ECCD-1, 1:200; M. Takeichi), and anti-Nidogen

Alexa-488, 546, or 647 (1:1,000, Life Technologies). Detection of pSmad1/5/8 was
enhanced using the Tyramide Signal Amplification (Perkin Elmer). Cells and tissues were
processed as previously reported1, and mounted in ProLong Gold with DAPI (Life
Technologies). Skin squamous cell cancer tissue array (SK802a) was obtained from US
Biomax Inc. Immunohistochemistry preparations were developed using ImmPRESS
Universal Antibody Polymer Detection method (Vector Laboratories). Confocal images
were captured by a scanning laser confocal microscope (LSM510 and LSM780; Carl Zeiss,
Inc.) using Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 oil and C-Apochromat 40×/1.2 water lenses. Images
were processed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop CS3. To quantify the number of
ectodermal cells at E9.5, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in
PBS + 0.1% Triton (Sigma), and the nuclei were labeled with TO-PRO-3 as recommended
(Life Technologies). Tiled Z-stack images of were collected on a Zeiss LSM780 using a
Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil lens. Stacks and metadata were imported into MATLAB
(Mathworks Inc.) using the LOCI Bio-Formats Importer36. For each stack, the surface was
located by finding the first Z position with an average intensity 3-fold above background,
and the stack was cropped to 6 μm corresponding to the surface epithelium. The resulting
images were segmented in 3D using Imaris (Bitplane AG) to obtain counts of nuclei.
Flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

Primary epidermal keratinocytes were isolated37 and then purified by fluorescence activated
cell sorting (FACS) using BD FACSAria II (BD Biosciences). Nucleotide analogue EdU
(50mg/g body weight) was injected intraperitoneally 2 hrs prior to processing, and EdU
(Life Technologies) incorporation and active Caspase-3 (BD Pharmingen) assays were
performed as recommended. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed in whole skin dissociated
with a sequential incubation in collagenase (Sigma; 0.25% in HBSS for 90 min) and trypsin
(Gibco; 0.25% in PBS for 15 min) at 37 °C. The following biotin-conjugated rat antibodies
(1:100; Pharmingen) were used: anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-CD103 (M290), anti-Ly-6G/C
(RB6-8C5), anti-CD3e (145-2C11), anti-CD45 (30-F11), and anti-CD45R (RA3-6B2).
YFP/RFP quantification was based on detection of the native protein in unfixed cells. Flow
cytometric analysis was performed on BD LSR II.
Cell culture assays

Author Manuscript

Cells were cultured in 0.05 mM Ca2+ (E18.5 mouse epidermal keratinocytes and SCC cells)
or 1.5 mM Ca2+ (human SCC) E-media supplemented with 15% serum. Cell adhesion in
primary epidermal keratinocytes seeded at low confluence was assayed by replacing their
growth medium with a 1.5 mM Ca2+ E-media, and fixing them at different times thereafter.
Nucleotide analogue EdU (10 μM) was added to cell culture media 90 min prior to
processing, and contact inhibition was analyzed in cells 3 days after reaching confluence.
Inhibition of Wnt signalling was achieved by addition of 5 μM Tankyrase inhibitor XAV939
[IC50 values 11 nM (Tnks1) and 4 nM (Tnks2)] to the media 12 hrs before the start of the
experiments.

Lentiviral constructs

Author Manuscript

Sequences of RNAi constructs are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Design of LV-RFP, LVGFP and LV-Cre has been previously reported1. Lentiviral construct for inducible shRNA
expression is a modification of tet-pLKO-puro38 (Addgene plasmid 21915), where the
IRES-Puro cassette was replaced between the XmaI and KpnI sites with the ligation of PCRamplified XmaI/NheI flanked P2A fragment and NheI/KpnI flanked nlsCre cDNA. The
lentiviral Wnt reporter was fashioned after the lentiviral Beta-catenin Activated Reporter39.
It includes 12 Tcf/Lef binding sites followed by a minimal TK promoter and an mRFP1
transgene that were subcloned into a pLKO.1 backbone between KpnI and NheI sites.
Lentiviral BMP-reporter that contains a pair of BMP response elements is a derivative of
BRE-ZsGreen4, where the reporter cassette between XhoI and NheI sites has been placed
between SalI and NheI sites of the pLKO-nlsCre-MCS vector.

Tumor free survival

Author Manuscript

Control and HrasoncoX2 animals were transduced at E9.5 with low-titre LV-Cre containing
constitutively expressing or inducible shRNA against Scrambled control or test Ctnnb1 and
Mllt6 shRNAs. Transductions were confirmed by real-time PCR of P7 (newborn)
littermates, and the remaining animals were monitored for an additional 12 weeks. Animals
were assessed every 2-3 days, and scored positive when tumors were larger than 2 mm in
diameter. Animals transduced with an LV-Cre containing inducible shRNAs were allowed
to form tumors for 60 days, at which point individual tumors were measured along their
short and long axis using a digital caliper (t=0). Next, tumor-bearing animals were treated by
a single IP injection of Doxycycline (100 μl of 50 mg/ml) and maintained on Doxycycline
containing chow for 8 weeks, and tumor size was assayed every 7 days. Because the tumor
volumes at t=0 showed a range between 4-20 mm3, the assayed tumor size was normalized
to the initial tumor volume, and expressed as fold-change over time. Transplantation of SCC
cells transduced with control shRNA, or shRNAs targeting mouse and human Ctnnb1 and
Mllt6, into immuno-compromised Nude recipients were performed as previously
described28, and animals were monitored every 3 days for a month. Tumor size was
measured using a digital caliper, and tumor volume was calculated using the formula
[(length × width)2 × π]/6.
TCF3/4 CHIP seq and luciferase assay

Author Manuscript

Details of the TCF3/4 CHIP seq will be reported elsewhere. For luciferase assays, passage
9-14 293FT cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates and transfected at 60-70%
confluence using standard calcium phosphate procedures. Cells were co-transfected with
control Renilla pRL-TK, and combinations of 50 ng pGL3-Mllt6, Mllt6mutant, Axin2, or
Axin2mutant and 200 ng of K14-expression vectors encoding Lef1, ΔNβcat, or control
(empty vector). After 44 hours, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured
using the TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Biosystems) and the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay
System (Promega). Each transfection was performed in duplicate and repeated 7 times.

Sample preparation and pre-amplification

Author Manuscript

Epidermal cells were isolated from E18.5 mouse skin using previously established
procedures37. Cells from individual embryos were used for genomic DNA isolation with the
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen), and each sample was analyzed for target transduction
using real-time PCR. gDNAs from 30 transduced embryos were pooled, and 200 μg of the
total were used as template in a 10 ml pre-amplification reaction with 21 cycles and Phusion
High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB). PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel, and a
clean ~200 bp band was isolated using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit as recommended by the
manufacturer (Qiagen). Final samples were then sent for Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing.
Sequence processing and relative shRNA quantification

Author Manuscript

Author Manuscript

For each genotype, DNA from 30 embryos was pooled and independently sequenced using
custom forward (5′aatgatacggcgaccaccgagatctacactctttccctacacgacgctcttccgatctatatcttgtggaaaggacgaaacacc-3′)
and reverse (5′-caagcagaagacggcatacgagctcttccgatctaattgtggatgaatactgccatttgtc-3′) oligos.
Illumina reads were trimmed to the 21 nt hairpin sequence using the FASTX-Toolkit and
aligned to the TRC 2.x library with BWA (v 0.6.2)40 using a maximum edit distance of 3.
Putative growth regulators were identified by combining two methodologies. First, Illumina
reads from 3 sets of 30 embryos were treated as independent biological replicates in the
DESeq R package12. Dispersions (variability) for each hairpin were estimated using a local
fit to the data for each genotype, and hairpins with a p-value < 0.05 by the negative binomial
test were considered for downstream analysis. Second, an analysis was carried out on a
pooled data set in which the reads from 3 sets of embryos were combined to maximize
screen coverage and average biological variability. Although this precludes estimation of
within-group variability, it has the effect of reducing noise for poorly counted hairpins when
operating close to the minimum required screen coverage. Fisher’s exact test was applied on
a per-hairpin basis using combined reads by assembling a 2×2 contingency table41. The
columns of the table are the treatment conditions (e.g. control and HrasoncoX2), and the rows
correspond to the sequencing counts for a given hairpin in the first, and the counts for all
other hairpins in the pool in the second. The test thus calculates the probability of observing
a difference in hairpin representation relative to the expected representation in the pool. We
further adjust the p-value for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction.
Hairpins with a p-value < 0.05 were considered for further analysis. A gene was considered
significantly enriched or depleted if at least 2 hairpins exhibited a 2-fold or greater change in
normalized reads with a significant p-value, and no hairpins in the set exhibited a change of
equal magnitude in the opposite direction. Hits common to both analyses were ranked by
number of significant hairpins and the magnitude of their effect. All analyses were carried
out in the R statistical enviroment42, with some plots produced using the ggplot2 package43.
Gene lists were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems),
and analyses and graphic outputs of relative enrichment in functional gene categories were
performed as recommended.

Choice of statistical analysis of relative shRNA abundance

Author Manuscript

The strength of the Fisher’s exact test is that it can calculate a probability of observing a
difference in shRNA representation in a comparison of pooled data sets. When operating
close to the minimum required screen coverage or when it is not feasible to perform many
independent replicates, this strategy can be advantageous to increase coverage and reduce
noise if combined with additional stringent criteria (i.e. requiring a gene to be targeted by
multiple hairpins) and validation.

Author Manuscript

Because this methodology does not explicitly account for sample-to-sample variability
(instead maximizing coverage and averaging out variability), we independently analyzed our
data using two additional statistical methodologies that directly address variability within
biological replicates. Importantly, both of these methods employed the same stringent set of
thresholds (2-fold change in hairpin count, and a requirement for least 2 hairpins to show a
significant effect in same direction, and none in the opposite). First, we utilized DESeq12, an
R package designed for the analysis of Illumina sequencing-based assays, which estimates
and accounts for biological variability in a statistical test based on the negative binomial
distribution. Second, we treated independently sequenced sets of 30 embryos as biological
replicates, and generated replicate-specific lists of candidate genes. Comparison of hits
shared between these replicates to the hits identified in our analysis of pooled samples
yielded a highly conserved set of candidate genes consistent with strong reproducibility of
our data. Both analyses identify a list of candidates that substantially overlaps with those
identified by our pooling and ranking scheme, with nearly all of our top hits identified
regardless of the methodology.

Author Manuscript

When conducting shRNA drop-out screens, perhaps the most important criteria in
identifying potential candidates is that a gene be targeted by multiple, independent hairpins
to avoid off-target effects. We thus felt our data would be best-served by combining an
analysis of pooled data, which tends to be more inclusive at the level of hairpins and enables
ranking by number of independent hairpins, and the results of DESeq, which ensures
reproducibility of hits.
RNAseq and IPA network analyses

Author Manuscript

Epidermal progenitors were FACS sorted into TrizolLS (Invitrogen) and RNA was purified
using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research) per manufacturer’s instructions.
Quality of the RNA was determined using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, with all samples
passing the quality threshold of RNA integrity numbers (RIN)>8. Library preparation using
Illumina TrueSeq mRNA sample preparation kit was performed at the Weill Cornell
Medical College Genomic Core facility, and cDNA was sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000.
Reads were mapped to mm9 build of the mouse genome using TopHat, and transcript
assembly and differential expression were determined using Cufflinks44. Differentially
regulated transcripts were analyzed in IPA (Ingenuity Systems), and the upstream
transcriptional regulators were predicted using the Upstream Regulator Analysis package,
with a significant overlap between the dataset genes and transcription factor targets set at
p<0.01, and the regulation direction (activated or inhibited) at z-score=2.

Statistics

Author Manuscript

All quantitative data were collected from experiments performed in at least triplicate, and
expressed as mean ± standard deviation (s.d.) or standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). The fits
of cellular and tumor growth were compared using the extra sum-of-squares F-test, and
expression of Ctnnb1 and Mllt6 in human SCC tissue was analyzed using a non-parametric
(Spearman) correlation. Differences between groups were assayed using two-tailed student
t-test using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). Significant differences were considered when
P<0.05.

Scrambled shRNA, and LV-Cre co-expressing candidate-targeting shRNA, leads to
generation of YFP+RFP+ Scrambled and YFP+ knockdown clones in control or HrasG12V
animals. Numbers of YFP+ cells (normalized to YFP+RFP+) in control and HrasoncoX2

activation z-score (two-fold) and p-value of a correct prediction (p=0.01). f, Significant
overlap in differentially regulated transcripts is observed following depletion of β-catenin
and Mllt6 in HrasG12V epidermal progenitors. Error bars indicate (c) s.e.m. and (d) s.d. In
real-time PCR experiment (d), data are shown for three embryos assayed in two independent
reactions (n=6). c,d, n.s. (not significant, P>0.05), * (P≤0.05), and ** (P≤0.01) indicate
statistical significance. Scale bar, 50 μm.

a, shRNA-mediated depletion of Ctnnb1 or Mllt6 delays spontaneous tumor initiation in
HrasoncoX2 mice (n=9 in all conditions except LV-Scram transduced HrasoncoX2 n=18).
Control lines correspond to animals transduced with shRNAs with no impact on
tumorigenesis. b, Tumor volume of Ctnnb1- and Mllt6-depleted mouse SCCs transplants are
significantly reduced after 30 days of growth. c, Tumor initiation following
xenotransplantation of shRNA-transduced human SCC cells is significantly delayed
following knockdown of human Ctnnb1 or Mllt6. d, Induction of Ctnnb1 or Mllt6
knockdown in preexisting spontaneous mouse papillomas results in impaired growth and
sometimes regression. a-d, Transduction of Scrambled shRNA (Scram) served as control.
Error bars (b,d) indicate s.e.m. b-d, n=12 transplants (b,c) or tumors (d). * (P≤0.05), and **
(P≤0.01) indicates statistical significance of the observed differences.
