Abstract
Critical to mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis and the
design of chemopreventive strategies is whether procarcinogen bioactivation in an extrahepatic target tissue (e.g., the
lung) is essential for tumor formation. This study aims to
develop a mouse model capable of revealing the role of
pulmonary microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450)–mediated
metabolic activation in xenobiotic-induced lung cancer. A
novel triple transgenic mouse model, with the NADPH-P450
reductase (Cpr) gene deleted in a lung-specific and doxycycline-inducible fashion (lung-Cpr -null), was generated. CPR,
the obligate electron donor for microsomal P450 enzymes,
is essential for the bioactivation of many procarcinogens.
The lung-Cpr -null mouse was studied to resolve whether
pulmonary P450 plays a major role in 4-(methylnitrosamino)1–(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)–induced lung cancer by
producing carcinogenic metabolites in the target tissue. A
liver-Cpr-null mouse was also studied to test whether hepatic
P450 contributes predominantly to systemic clearance of
NNK, thereby decreasing NNK-induced lung cancer. The numbers of NNK-induced lung tumors were reduced in the lungCpr-null mice but were increased in the liver-Cpr -null mice,
relative to wild-type control mice. Decreased lung tumor
multiplicity in the lung-Cpr -null mice correlated with reduced
lung O6-methylguanine adduct levels, without decreases in
NNK bioavailability, consistent with decreased NNK bioactivation in the lung. Moreover, lung tumors in lung-Cpr -null
mice were positive for CPR expression, indicating that the
tumors did not originate from Cpr -null cells. Thus, we have
confirmed the essential role of pulmonary P450-mediated
metabolic activation in NNK-induced lung cancer, and our
mouse models should be applicable to studies on other procarcinogens that require P450-mediated metabolic activation.

Introduction
Microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes catalyze the
metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous compounds
(1). In many cases, P450-mediated metabolic activation of a xenobiotic compound is a key step that leads to acute toxicity or carcinogenicity. At the organ level, P450 enzymes are most abundant

in the liver, and hepatic P450-mediated metabolic activation is
often the major contributor to xenobiotic-induced hepatotoxicity
(e.g., ref. 2). However, for most chemical compounds, it is not
known whether hepatic P450-mediated metabolic activation is also
responsible for chemical-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity in
extrahepatic organs, such as the lung.
The lung is a portal-of-entry organ for airborne environmental
compounds. The expression of many microsomal P450s has been
detected in human lung (3), as well as in lungs of laboratory
animals (4). Pulmonary P450-mediated metabolic activities may
play important roles in environmental chemical-induced toxicities
(3). However, metabolites generated in the liver or elsewhere may
also reach the lung to cause toxicity, as shown by our recent finding
that acetaminophen toxicity in mouse lung was at least partially
dependent on metabolic activation in the liver (2). Because of the
lack of appropriate experimental approaches, direct evidence for
the role of pulmonary P450-mediated metabolic activation in
xenobiotic-induced lung toxicity and carcinogenicity is still lacking
for most, if not all, xenobiotic compounds.
The microsomal P450 system consists of P450 enzymes and their
electron donor, NADPH-P450 reductase (CPR). In contrast to the
multiplicity of CYP genes, there is only one Cpr gene in mammals
(5), a fact which makes it feasible to knock out the activities of all
microsomal P450 enzymes via the deletion of this single Cpr gene.
Germ-line deletion of Cpr is embryonically lethal in mice (6, 7).
However, mouse models with liver-specific Cpr deletion (liverCpr-null) are viable (8, 9). In this study, a novel triple transgenic
mouse model (lung-Cpr-null), which permits doxycycline-inducible,
lung-specific Cpr deletion, was generated and used to test the
role of pulmonary P450 in 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1butanone (NNK)–induced lung carcinogenesis.
NNK is one of the most potent carcinogens identified in tobacco
smoke. NNK can readily induce lung adenoma in laboratory
animals (10) and is also considered a major risk factor for human
lung adenocarcinoma, which is currently the most frequent lung
cancer type (11). NNK-induced lung carcinogenesis is believed
to occur via P450-mediated a-hydroxylation, which leads to production of reactive metabolites that induce the formation of
DNA adducts, including O6-methylguanine (O6-mG; refs. 10, 12).
The in vivo role of P450 in NNK-induced carcinogenesis has
been indicated in studies using structurally diverse P450 inhibitors (10, 13–15). However, although P450 isoforms active toward
NNK are expressed in the respiratory tract in rodents and humans
(16, 17), liver microsomes are at least as active as lung microsomes in NNK metabolic activation in vitro (18), and there is no
direct evidence regarding whether target tissue bioactivation is
required for NNK-induced carcinogenesis. In the experiments using
P450 inhibitors, where the inhibitors could interact with P450
enzymes throughout the body, it was not possible to distinguish

contributions from differing tissues or cells. A system that permits
tissue- or cell-selective modulation of P450 function in the lung has
not been available until now.
To study the relative contributions of pulmonary and hepatic
microsomal P450 enzymes in NNK-induced lung carcinogenesis,
we first back-crossed the lung-Cpr-null and liver-Cpr-null mice
to the susceptible A/J strain (19). The conditional Cpr-null offspring and their littermate controls were then studied for NNKinduced lung tumor formation, O6-mG formation in the lung and
liver, and systemic clearance of NNK and its major metabolite
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL). Our results
strongly support the hypothesis that pulmonary P450 enzymes
play an essential role in NNK-induced lung carcinogenesis by
producing carcinogenic metabolites directly in the target tissue,
whereas hepatic P450 enzymes play an important role in systemic clearance of NNK, thereby decreasing the bioavailability
of NNK in the lung and the susceptibility to NNK-induced lung
carcinogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Mouse breeding. The liver-Cpr-null (8) and Cprlox/lox mice (transgenic
mice with floxed Cpr alleles; ref. 20) were from breeding stocks maintained
at the Wadsworth Center. The CCSP-rtTA/tetO-Cre mouse was a kind gift
from Dr. Jeffery A. Whitsett of the University of Cincinnati (Cincinnati, OH;
refs. 21–23). The lung-Cpr-null mice were generated by cross-breeding
CCSP-rtTA/tetO-Cre mice and Cprlox/lox mice. The CCSP-rtTA/tetO-Cre mice
(on a mixed 129/Sv and FVB/N background) and the Cprlox/lox mice (on a
mixed C57BL/6 and 129/Sv background) were each backcrossed
thrice to the A/J strain, before they were intercrossed to obtain the A/JN3 lung-Cpr-null mice (CCSP-rtTAhemi/tetO-Crehemi/Cprlox/lox ) and control
littermates (CCSP-rtTAhemi/Cprlox/lox or Cprlox/lox ; see Supplementary Fig. S1
for a detailed breeding scheme). The liver-Cpr-null mouse (on a mixed
C57BL/6 and 129/Sv background) was backcrossed to the A/J strain five
times, before the heterozygotes were intercrossed to obtain A/J-N5 liverCpr-null (Alb-Crehemi/Cprlox/lox ) and wild-type (WT; Cprlox/lox ) littermates.
Animal use and doxycycline treatment. All animal use protocols were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the

Wadsworth Center. Mice not treated with doxycycline were fed with
a standard chow diet (Prolab RMH350) ad libitum. For studies of
doxycycline-induced Cpr deletion in the lung-Cpr-null mice, the animals
were kept on doxycycline-containing food pellets (625 mg/kg; Harlan
Teklad) either between the ages of 1 and 2 months or between E0 (through
the dam) and the age of 2 months, according to a reported protocol (24).
The amount of food consumed was f3 g daily per mouse, at 6 weeks to
4 months of age.
NNK treatment. For pharmacokinetic studies and determination of
tissue levels of O6-mG, the animals were treated with NNK by a single
i.p. injection at the dose of 100 mg/kg for the liver-Cpr-null mice and
WT control littermates or 200 mg/kg or 20 Amol/mouse for the lungCpr-null mice and control littermates. Blood samples were collected by tail
bleeding with a heparin-coated capillary at 5, 20, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min
after NNK injection. Lungs and livers were collected for determination of
tissue levels of O6-mG at 4 or 24 h after NNK injection and stored at 80jC
until use.
Lung tumor formation was induced with NNK according to the protocol
of Jalas et al. (12). All animals, at the age of 2 months, with or without the
doxycycline treatment from E0, were given a single i.p. injection of 0.15 mL
of either saline or NNK at either 20 Amol/mouse for the lung-Cpr-null mice
and control littermates or 10 Amol/mouse for the liver-Cpr-null mice and
WT littermates. Following the injection, all animals were maintained on
AIN-93G diet (Dyets, Inc.) until sacrificed 4 months later for the tumor
bioassay. The lung tumor multiplicity (averaged number of tumors per
mouse) and frequency (percentage of mice with tumors) were determined
independently by two researchers, and the averages of the two analyses are
reported.
Other methods. Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated using the
WinNonlin software (version 5.0.1) from Pharsight. Methods for analysis
of genotypes of the transgenic mice; immunohistochemical analysis of CPR,
surfactant protein C (SP-C), and Clara cell secretary protein (CCSP)
expression; quantitative PCR analysis of the abundance of the Cpr- (deleted
Cpr allele) and Cprlox alleles; quantitative PCR analysis of SP-C mRNA
expression levels in the isolated alveolar type II cell preparations and in
the whole lung; and determination of tissue levels of O6-mG and plasma
levels of NNK and NNAL are described in the Supplementary Data. Statistical analyses were done with use of the SigmaStat software (SPSS, Inc.).
Statistical significance of differences between two groups in various
variables was examined using Student’s t test; for samples that failed

of CPR expression in the lungs of
untreated or doxycycline (Dox)-treated
lung-Cpr -null mice and control littermates.
Paraffin sections (4–5 Am) of lungs from
2-month-old female mice were analyzed
with a rabbit anti-rat CPR antibody (A–L).
Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary
antibody was used for visualization of the
antigen sites. Regions corresponding to the
proximal, midlevel, and terminal airways
were included for each group. No signal
was detected when the primary antibody
was replaced by a normal goat serum
(data not shown). Control littermates (A–C)
were treated with doxycycline from E0.
Lung-Cpr -null mice were either untreated
(D–F ) or treated with doxycycline from the
age of 1 mo (G–I ) or from E0 (J–L). The
images were representative of at least
three mice analyzed in each group.

NOTE: A. All mice were female and were treated with doxycycline from E0. At 2 mo of age, they received a single i.p. injection of either NNK
(20 Amol/mouse) or 0.15 mL saline. Thereafter, doxycycline treatment ceased, and all animals were kept on AIN93G diet until they were sacrificed for
tumor bioassay, at 4 mo after the NNK or saline injection. Tumor multiplicity is shown as mean F SE. Tumor frequency was calculated as percentage of
mice with tumor in each group. Histologic characterization of these lung tumors (see Supplementary Data) indicated that they represent foci of
hyperplasia or adenoma, but not carcinoma; lymphoid nodules and perivascular lymphoid cuffs were also seen, as evidence of subacute to chronic
inflammation, which could be secondary to tumor growth. B. Animals (2-month-old females) were either given a single i.p. injection of NNK at 20 Amol/
mouse and sacrificed at 4 h or given an i.p. dose of 200 mg/kg and sacrificed at 24 h after dosing. The values shown are mean F SE (n = 4, unless
specified otherwise). Examples of the detection of pulmonary O6-mG are shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.

Results
General characterization of the lung-Cpr -null mice. The
lung-Cpr-null (CCSP-rtTAhemi/tetO-Crehemi/Cprlox/lox ) mouse was
prepared by cross-breeding CCSP-rtTA/tetO-Cre mice (21–23) and
Cprlox/lox mice (20). In these mice, the expression of Cre
recombinase is controlled by the tetracycline operator (tetO),
which can be activated by the reverse tetracycline transactivator
(rtTA) in the presence of doxycycline. The rtTA transgene is driven
by the rat CCSP promoter, which is active in the Clara cells in the
airway and type II epithelial cells in the alveoli of the transgenic
mice (21, 23, 25).
The A/J-N3 lung-Cpr-null mice and control littermates, containing f88% of the recipient A/J genetic background (26), were used
for characterization and subsequent metabolism and toxicology
studies. The lung-Cpr-null mice were normal compared with the
control littermates. There was no indication of embryonic lethality
associated with the lung-Cpr-null genotype (Supplementary Table
S1). No behavioral changes were noticed. There was no significant
difference in either body weight or weights of lung and liver,

www.aacrjournals.org

between adult female lung-Cpr-null mice and control littermates at
the age of 2 months, for either untreated mice (data not shown) or
mice treated with doxycycline (Supplementary Table S2). Body and
organ weights were not determined for the male mice. No histologic changes were observed in the lungs of the lung-Cpr-null
mice, either with or without doxycycline treatment (e.g., see Supplementary Fig. S2).
Doxycycline-induced Cpr deletion in the lungs of the lungCpr -null mice. CPR was detected in virtually all epithelial cells
lining the conducting airway in the control mice (data not shown),
and this expression pattern was not altered by doxycycline
treatment (Fig. 1A–C), indicating that doxycycline treatment did
not have any noticeable effect on CPR expression. In untreated
lung-Cpr-null mice, the loss of CPR expression was observed in a
small fraction of the airway epithelial cells (Fig. 1D–F), presumably
due to the ‘‘leakiness’’ of the tetO-Cre transgene expression (23, 25).
However, the number of cells lacking CPR expression was clearly
much greater in doxycycline-treated lung-Cpr-null mice (Fig. 1G–L)
than in the untreated ones (Fig. 1D–F). Furthermore, in untreated
lung-Cpr-null mice (Fig. 1D–F) or in lung-Cpr-null mice treated
with doxycycline between ages of 1 to 2 months (Fig. 1G–I), the
CPR-negative cells were randomly distributed around the airway,
whereas in the lung-Cpr-null mice treated with doxycycline
between E0 and the age of 2 months, the CPR-negative cells

appeared in large patches, resulting in long stretches of CPRnegative cells, usually present on only one side of the airway
(Fig. 1J–L).
The extent of Cpr deletion in the alveolar type II epithelial cells
(AECII) was determined using quantitative DNA-PCR in AECII cell
preparations (f2.5-fold enriched, compared with the whole lung)
from 2-month-old lung-Cpr-null mice (Supplementary Table S3).
The extents of Cpr deletion in the AECII-enriched cell preparations,
which should still be lower than the extents in a pure AECII cell
preparation, were significantly higher than those in the whole lung
in either untreated (17.4% in AECII versus 6.2% in whole lung) or
doxycycline-treated lung-Cpr-null mice (32.2% in AECII versus
18.2% in whole lung), indicating that Cpr was preferentially deleted
in this cell type. The E0- to 2-month doxycycline treatment
protocol, which was more effective than the 1- to 2-month
doxycycline treatment protocol for induction of Cpr deletion
(Fig. 1G–I versus J–L; Supplementary Table S3), was used for
all subsequent studies. In the following text, we will use ‘‘lungCpr-null-doxycycline’’ and ‘‘control-doxycycline’’ to represent lungCpr -null and control littermates, respectively, treated with
doxycycline between E0 and the age of 2 months.
NNK-induced lung tumor formation in the lung-Cpr -null
mice and control littermates. The effects of Cpr deletion in the
lung on NNK-induced lung tumor formation were determined
using the lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline and control-doxycycline mice,
and the results are shown in Table 1A. Female mice were used for
these and subsequent studies because the NNK tumor bioassay was
originally established using female mice, which are more sensitive
than male mice to NNK-induced lung tumor formation (27).
Following a single i.p. injection of NNK at 20 Amol/mouse, lung
tumor multiplicity in the lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice (14.8

tumors per mouse) was f43.0% of that in similarly treated controldoxycycline mice (34.4 tumors per mouse). Within the NNK-treated
control-doxycycline group, there was no difference in lung tumor
multiplicity between CCSP-rtTA/Cprlox/lox mice (34.6 tumors per
mouse, n = 8) and Cprlox/lox mice (34.2 tumors per mouse, n = 6).
No tumor was detected in saline-treated control-doxycycline
mice, and only one of six saline-treated lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline
mice had a single lung tumor. There was no significant difference
in tumor frequency between NNK-treated control-doxycycline
(100%) and NNK-treated lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice (92%) or
between saline-treated control-doxycycline (0%) and saline-treated
lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice (17%). The averaged body weight at
either 2 months of age (Supplementary Table S2) or at the time of
tumor bioassay (Table 1A) did not differ significantly among the
groups studied. NNK-induced tumors were not detected in other
organs examined, including liver, heart, pancreas, kidney, uterus,
brain, and nose (data not shown). In other experiments not presented, doxycycline treatment was found to not affect lung tumor
multiplicity in NNK-treated WT A/J mice.
Tumors in the NNK-treated lung-Cpr-null mice were derived
from CPR-expressing AECII cells. The NNK-induced adenoma or
adenocarcinoma in the lungs of the A/J mice is believed to
originate primarily from AECII cells (28). However, NNK-induced
lung tumors have also been reported to originate from Clara cells
(29). Because Cpr deletion occurred in only a portion of the Clara
cells and AECII cells in the lung-Cpr-null mice, the residual lung
tumors could have originated from Clara and/or AECII cells that
have an intact Cpr and thus normal CPR expression or from other
types of lung cells, which also have an intact Cpr. Therefore,
we examined the expressions of CPR, SP-C (a marker of AECII
cells), and CCSP (a marker of Clara cells) in 48 tumors from three

(A, C , and E) and control-doxycycline mice
(B, D, F, G, H , and I ) were analyzed.
Immunohistochemical analysis for CPR
(A and B) was done as described in the
legend of Figure 1. SP-C was detected
using a rabbit anti-prosurfactant protein C
antibody (C and D ), whereas CCSP
was detected using a rabbit anti-CCSP
antibody (E and F ). Alexa Fluor
594–conjugated secondary antibody was
used for the detection of SP-C and CCSP,
whereas Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated
secondary antibody was used for the
detection of CPR. The primary antibodies
were omitted for negative controls (G–I ),
which were processed with either Alexa
Fluor 488–conjugated (G ) or Alexa Fluor
594–conjugated (H and I ) secondary
antibody. As positive controls, expression
of SP-C (J ) and CCSP (K ) in the normal
lung tissues of the control-doxycycline
mouse was also examined. Bar, 50 Am.

NNK-treated lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice and in selected
tumors (as positive controls) from three NNK-treated controldoxycycline mice. We found that all of the tumors examined were
positive for CPR (Fig. 2A and B) and SP-C expression (Fig. 2C
and D), but they were negative for CCSP expression (Fig. 2E and F).
In normal lung tissues, the staining for SP-C was only observed in
the alveolar regions, presumably in AECII cells (Fig. 2J), whereas
the staining for CCSP was only observed in the airway but not
in the alveolar regions (Fig. 2K). These results indicated that the
NNK-induced tumors in the lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice, as
well as those in the control-doxycycline mice, were derived from
CPR-expressing AECII cells.
NNK-induced O6-mG formation in the lungs and livers of the
lung-Cpr -null mice and control littermates. The effect of lungspecific CPR loss on NNK-induced O6-mG formation in the lung
and liver is shown in Table 1B. At 4 h after a single i.p. injection of NNK at 20 Amol/mouse, the levels of O6-mG in the lungs of
the lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice (13.1 pmol/Amol guanine)
were f37% of those in similarly treated control-doxycycline mice
(35.1 pmol/Amol guanine). In a separate experiment, at 24 h after
NNK injection at 200 mg/kg, a dose similar to 20 Amol/mouse for
mice of 20 to 25 g body weight, the levels of O6-mG in the lungs of
the lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice (30.9 pmol/Amol guanine)
were f46% of those in the control-doxycycline mice (67.7 pmol/
Amol guanine). In contrast to the significantly reduced levels of
O6-mG in the lungs of the lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice, the
levels of O6-mG in the livers of the lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice
at 24 h after NNK injection were not significantly different from
those of similarly treated control-doxycycline mice. No significant

www.aacrjournals.org

difference was observed between the control and controldoxycycline mice in the levels of O6-mG in the lungs at either 4
or 24 h or in the livers at 24 h after the NNK injection (Table 1B),
indicating that doxycycline had no unintended effects on the
formation of O6-mG in either the lungs or liver.
Systemic clearance of NNK and NNAL in the lung-Cpr -null
mice and control littermates. NNAL is the major circulating
metabolite of NNK in both rodents and humans (11, 30). The
formation of NNAL from NNK is catalyzed by cytosolic carbonyl
reductase (10), which is not CPR dependent. However, like NNK,
NNAL can be bioactivated by P450 to cause lung cancers in the A/J
mice (31). The results of pharmacokinetic studies confirmed that
the lungs of the NNK-treated lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice were
not exposed to lower doses of NNK and NNAL compared with
those of the similarly treated control-doxycycline mice (Supplementary Fig. S4; Supplementary Table S4). Additionally, the plasma
levels of NNK and NNAL, as well as the calculated pharmacokinetic
variables (Supplementary Fig. S4; Supplementary Table S4), were
not significantly different between the control and controldoxycycline groups, further indicating that doxycycline did not
have a direct effect on the absorption, metabolism, or clearance of
NNK and NNAL.
NNK-induced lung tumor formation in the liver-Cpr -null
mice and WT littermates. The findings obtained using the
lung-Cpr-null mice suggested that NNK metabolites generated in
the liver do not play a major role in NNK-induced lung cancer.
To confirm this hypothesis, we compared NNK-induced lung tumor
formation between liver-Cpr-null and WT mice. Notably, a lower
dose of NNK was used here because we expected the bioavailability

of NNK and NNAL to be higher in studies with the liver-Cprnull mice than in the studies with the lung-Cpr-null mice. As
shown in Table 2A, the multiplicity of lung tumors in the
A/J-N5 liver-Cpr-null mice (15.5 F 2.3 tumors per mouse) was
2.4-fold higher than that in similarly treated WT littermates (6.5 F
1.4 tumors per mouse). Tumors were not detected, or rare, in
saline-treated WT or liver-Cpr-null mice. In the NNK-treated
animals, the tumor frequency was 100% for both liver-Cpr-null and
WT mice.
NNK-induced O6-mG formation in the lungs and livers of the
liver-Cpr -null mice and WT littermates. The levels of
O6-mG in the livers of the liver-Cpr-null mice at 24 h after a single
i.p. injection of NNK at 100 mg/kg were only f5% of those in the
WT mice (Table 2B), consistent with the loss of hepatic microsomal
P450 activity (8). In contrast, the levels of O6-mG in the lungs of the
liver-Cpr-null mice were either not significantly different (at 4 h) or
else higher (at 24 h) than those of the WT mice after the NNK
injection (Table 2B), indicating that the NNK-induced DNA adduct
formation in the lung was not dependent on NNK metabolism in
the liver.
Reduced systemic clearance of NNK and NNAL in the liverCpr-null mice. Following an i.p. injection of NNK at 100 mg/kg,
the plasma levels of NNK and NNAL were significantly higher in the
liver-Cpr-null mice than those in the WT littermates (Fig. 3). For
both NNK and NNAL, t 1/2 and area under the concentration-time
curve (AUC) were significantly higher, and clearance was significantly lower, in the liver-Cpr-null mice than in WT littermates (Table 3). For NNAL, the C max value was also significantly
higher in the liver-Cpr-null mice than in WT littermates. The

pharmacokinetic data indicate that the lungs of the liverCpr-null mice were exposed to substantially higher levels of NNK
and NNAL than were those of the WT mice, following the NNK
injection.

Discussion
In the lung-Cpr-null mouse, the deletion of the floxed Cpr gene
required the sequential activation of two transgenes, CCSP-rtTA
and tetO-Cre. Previous studies had shown that the CCSP-rtTA/tetO
combination confers essentially lung-selective transgene expression in double transgenic mice (25, 32). The tissue specificity
and developmental onset of the Cre gene were controlled by the
rat CCSP promoter of the CCSP-rtTA transgene. The expression
of rtTA in the CCSP-rtTA transgenic mouse was localized to subsets of Clara cells and AECII cells in the lung (21, 23), as was found
here for the CRE-mediated Cpr deletion in the lung-Cpr-null mice.
The CCSP-rtTA/tetO-Cre mice have been used by several other
groups to achieve controllable deletion or activation of floxed
transgenes (23, 33). Similar to the lung-Cpr-null mice, a mosaic
pattern of doxycycline-induced deletion or activation of the floxed
transgenes in the lung was reported for these transgenic mice
(23, 33).
Among all of the enzymes that are CPR dependent (34), only
microsomal P450 enzymes are directly associated with the
clearance or bioactivation of procarcinogens and the subsequent
formation of DNA adducts and initiation of carcinogenesis (10).
Therefore, our findings of a decreased lung tumor multiplicity in
NNK-treated lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice and an increased lung
tumor multiplicity in NNK-treated liver-Cpr-null mice indicated
that pulmonary, but not hepatic, P450-mediated bioactivation
plays a major role in NNK-induced lung tumor formation. This
conclusion is supported by corresponding decreases in O6-mG
levels in the lungs of the lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice, in which
systemic levels of NNK and NNAL, the major circulating NNK
metabolite (30, 35), as well as hepatic P450 activity in NNK
bioactivation, were largely unchanged. Further support for the
critical role of lung P450 in NNK-induced carcinogenesis came
from studies using liver-Cpr-null mice, in which the levels of O6-mG
was increased in the lungs at 24 h after the NNK injection, despite a
nearly total loss of hepatic P450 activity toward NNK (8). Strong
support for the role of in situ metabolic activation in NNK-induced
lung carcinogenesis was also provided by the observation that all
tumors examined in the lung-Cpr-null-doxycycline mice originated
from cells that were positive for CPR expression, indicating that
cells with Cpr deletion and consequent loss of P450-mediated NNK
bioactivation did not develop into tumors.
Our conclusion that in situ P450-catalyzed metabolic activation
plays an essential role in NNK-induced lung carcinogenesis is
consistent with the findings of several previous studies, which,
based on biochemical reasoning, suggested that local generation of
short-lived and highly reactive metabolites, through P450-catalyzed
a-hydroxylation, is principally responsible for NNK-induced lung
cancer (10, 11). NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis was inhibited
by f40% as a result of pretreatment of A/J mice with indole3-carbinol, a treatment that led to decreased bioavailability of NNK
and NNAL, presumably as a consequence of induction of hepatic
P450 expression and, accordingly, decreased lung tissue levels of
O6-mG adduct (36). Indole-3-carbinol was also found to reduce the
level of stable NNK metabolites in the urine of human smokers (37).

the levels of lung DNA adduct formation in A/J mice (38) and F334
rats (39, 40) further supported the role of local metabolic activation in carcinogenesis. Moreover, whereas phenethyl isothiocyanate, an inhibitor of P450, and of NNK-induced lung tumor
formation in animal models, reduced the levels of NNK ahydroxylation metabolites in the lung as well as most other organs
examined (41), long-term feeding of phenethyl isothiocyanate,
together with NNK treatment, led to decreases in the ability of
lung, but not liver, microsomes to catalyze NNK a-hydroxylation
in vitro (42). This latter finding implicated that the protection,
afforded by dietary phenethyl isothiocyanate, of animals against
NNK-induced lung tumor formation was mainly mediated by
selective inhibition of metabolic activation of NNK in the lung,
rather than in the liver.
The present finding of a predominant role of lung P450 enzymes
in NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis contrasts with our recent
observation that acetaminophen-induced toxicity in mouse lung
and kidney was contributed at least partly by hepatic P450mediated metabolic activation (2). Thus, the relative contributions
of the hepatic and pulmonary P450-mediated metabolic activation
to xenobiotic-induced lung toxicity are compound dependent, a
finding that necessitates close examination of the in vivo metabolism and toxicity of individual compounds.
Because microsomal CYP-mediated activities, as well as other
CPR-dependent activities, are required in many endogenous
metabolic pathways (34), deletion of Cpr could lead to disruption
of cellular homeostasis and could indirectly modify the outcome of
the tumor bioassay. In the current study, the rates of spontaneous
formation of lung tumors were not changed in either lungCpr-null-doxycycline or liver-Cpr-null mice compared with the
control littermates, indicating that no significant changes in lung
tumor initiation or promotion occurred in these two transgenic
mice, in the absence of a carcinogen. In NNK-treated mice, tumor
initiation rates are expected to be altered as a consequence of
P450-mediated metabolic activation. However, it is as yet impossible to directly detect whether differences exist among the
experimental groups in tumor promotion following P450-mediated
NNK metabolic activation. Nonetheless, the strong correlation
between tumor multiplicity and tissue levels of O6-mG, a DNA
adduct formed as a consequence of P450-mediated a-hydroxylation
(10), indicates that the changes in the rates of tumor formation were
mainly due to a reduced metabolic activation, rather than to other,
indirect factors.

The expression of rtTA in the lung was recently found to cause
airspace enlargement (43, 44). In the current study, potential
changes in airspace size in our lung-Cpr-null mouse were not
investigated. However, the fact that we did not see any changes in
the formation of spontaneous or NNK-induced lung tumors in
CCSP-rtTA/Cprlox/lox mice compared with Cprlox/lox mice indicates
that the expression of the rtTA transgene, and potentially any
consequent effects on airspace size, did not modify NNK
bioactivation or NNK-induced cancer formation in the lung.
The systemic administration of doxycycline at relatively high
doses was found to cause fetoplacental toxicity (45) and alveolar
simplification (46). In the present study, doxycycline was given
to mice in the diet at f1.9 mg/d/mouse, a dose that was found
previously to have no effects on pregnancy or postnatal alveolarization (44). Under this low-dose doxycycline treatment protocol,
we also found that the litter size was normal. Furthermore,
NNK-induced pulmonary O6-mG and lung tumor formation was
not changed by doxycycline treatment in the control mice,
indicating that doxycycline treatment per se did not influence the
tumor outcome in the lung-Cpr-null mice.
In summary, our data strongly support the hypotheses that
pulmonary P450 plays an important role in NNK-induced lung
tumor formation by producing carcinogenic metabolites directly in
the target tissue, whereas hepatic P450 plays a major role in
systemic clearance of NNK, thereby protecting the lung against
NNK-induced carcinogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first
in vivo evidence to directly show the essential role of pulmonary
P450-mediated metabolic activation in NNK-induced lung cancer.
Our findings suggest that, for tobacco smoke-induced lung cancer,
chemopreventive strategies specifically targeting P450 enzymes in
the respiratory tract should be more effective than the use of
an inhibitor that also affects P450s in the liver. Our results also
shed light on the importance of genetic polymorphisms of NNKbioactivating P450 enzymes that are selectively expressed in the
human respiratory tract, particularly CYP2A13 (16), in the
interindividual differences in susceptibility to tobacco smokeinduced lung cancers.
The roles of pulmonary P450-mediated metabolic activation in
xenobiotic-induced lung tissue toxicity and carcinogenicity are
poorly understood for most, if not all, compounds. The lung-Cpr-null
mouse model generated in this study, as well as the liver-Cpr-null
mouse that was generated previously (8), should be broadly applicable to mechanistic studies on these additional lung toxicants.
