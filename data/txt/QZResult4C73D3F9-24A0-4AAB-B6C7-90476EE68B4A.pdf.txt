Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men in Western
societies. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a critical survival pathway for prostate cancer cells,
and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the principal treatment for patients with locally
advanced and metastatic disease. While a majority of patients initially respond to ADT, most will
eventually develop castrate-resistance, defined as disease progression despite serum testosterone
levels of less than 20ng/dL. The recent discovery that AR signaling persists during systemic
castration via intratumoral production of androgens led to the development of novel anti-androgen
therapies including abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide. While these agents effectively palliate
symptoms and prolong life, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains
incurable. An increased understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of
castrate-resistance is therefore needed to develop novel therapeutic approaches for this disease.
The aim of this review is to summarize the current literature on the biology and treatment of
castrate-resistant prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The mainstay of therapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic
prostate cancer, and biochemically recurrent disease after failure of localized treatments is
androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with gonadropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs
and anti-androgens.1 GnRH analogs like leuprolide cause continuous stimulation of the
pituitary gland, leading to `chemical castration' with suppression of testosterone production
from the testes, whereas anti-androgens directly inhibit the androgen receptor (AR).
ADT is known to provide remission of the disease, best evidenced by a decline of prostatespecific antigen (PSA) in about 90% of patients.2 After a mean time of 2–3 years, however,
the disease progresses despite continuous hormonal manipulation. This type of cancer is
known as castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).2 Metastatic castration-resistant prostate

cancer (mCPRC) is associated with a poor prognosis and mean survival time of only 16–18
months.3

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Docetaxel and cabazitaxel are the only FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration)approved chemotherapies for the treatment of mCRPC. These tubulin-binding taxanes have
been proven to decrease PSA levels and palliate symptoms but survival benefits are
modest.4 Another agent, sipuleucel-T (Provenge; Dendreon Corp., Seattle, WA) is a cellular
immunotherapy that has been shown to increase overall survival time for patients with
mCRPC.5, 6
The AR is believed to remain active in CRPC, and several new strategies to inhibit AR
signaling have recently been developed. Abiraterone acetate (Zytiga; Janssen Biotech, Inc.
Horsham, PA) is an FDA-approved inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis which blocks
cytochrome P450-c17 (CYP17), leading to suppression of androgens derived from the
adrenal glands, the prostate tumor, and the tumor microenvironment.7 This novel therapy
increased survival time by almost 4 months, increased the time to PSA progression, and was
relatively well tolerated by patients.7 MDV3100 (now known as enzalutamide), an AR
antagonist that prevents nuclear translocation and interaction with co-activators, has
produced similar results in recent clinical trials.8, 9

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although novel cytotoxic agents, AR blocking agents and immunotherapies represent
effective therapy strategies for mCRPC, important clinical questions remain. First, the
absence of any reliable biomarker does not allow clinicians to decide which patients will
benefit from these treatments or when to alter or terminate treatment. In addition, despite the
effective blocking of androgen biosynthesis10 and AR signaling, all patients eventually
progress.7, 11, 12 Furthermore, the optimal sequencing of these therapies remains unknown.
The general aim of this review is to summarize new evidence about mechanisms of castrateresistance and novel therapeutic approaches directed at this complex and enigmatic disease
state.

THE ROLE OF AR SIGNALING IN CRPC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The expression of PSA is mainly regulated by androgen response elements, suggesting that
the increasing PSA during ADT implies activation of AR transcriptional activity.13
Consistent with this hypothesis, various recent findings have supported the notion that one
of the most important mechanisms in CRPC development is the continuous activation of AR
in prostate cancer cells.3 Several cellular and molecular alterations are related to this postcastration activation of the AR, including incomplete blockade of AR-ligand signaling, AR
amplifications, AR mutations, aberrant AR co-regulator activities, and AR splice–variant
expression.14
Recent data suggest that despite castration, which decreases serum androgen levels,
intratumoral levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in patients with mCRPC
are similar to those found in hormone therapy naïve.2 Evidence suggests that upregulation
and stimulation of enzymes involved in androgen biosynthesis (including CYP17) occur
within the tumor microenvironment.15–17 In a recent study, Montgomery et al. demonstrated
that prostate cancer bone metastases can convert adrenal androgens to testosterone and
DHT.17 Of note, metastatic prostate cancer may amplify the HSD17B3 gene and lose copy
numbers of the HSD17B2 gene, leading to decreased conversion of testosterone to the less
active androstenedione.18 In another recent study, Mitsiades et al. found significant
heterogeneity in the expression of various steroidogenic enzymes in the tumor
microenvironment among patients with mCRPC, suggesting that the combination of
enzymatic blockage and potent anti-androgens is a reasonable therapeutic approach for

patients with mCRPC.19 Moreover, Efstathiou et al. recently showed that abiraterone acetate
effectively suppresses testosterone concentrations in both blood and the tumor
microenvironment to less than picograms per milliliter.20 Despite this degree of efficacy,
patients receiving abiraterone acetate will eventually show evidence of disease progression.
Enzalutamide is a novel AR antagonist that overcomes resistance to conventional antiandrogens a by blocking ligand binding, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and coactivator recruitment of AR.21 According to a recent phase I/II study in patients with
mCRPC, the use of enzalutamide is a safe, elicits PSA and radiographic response, and
results in a median time to progression of 47 weeks.8 The superiority of enzalutamide over
placebo was confirmed in a phase III clinical trial that showed increased overall survival
(4.8 months) and improvement in all secondary end points.9 Despite these encouraging
results, after a period of remission that is characterized by significant variation between
patients, these tumors eventually progress.
AR amplification

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CRPC is associated with increased expression of AR attributed to gene amplification and
other mechanisms, including increased mRNA stability.14, 22 Prior data from microarray
profiles of prostate cancer xenografts showed that higher AR mRNA was the only change
related to the development of castrate-resistance.19 Interestingly, an early study showed that
80% of the tumors acquiring AR amplification also demonstrated higher levels of AR
protein.23 Furthermore, studies utilizing fluorescence in situ hybridization have shown that
while AR gene amplifications are observed in 20–25% of CRPCs24 and in many cancer cell
lines derived from these patients, they are very rare in primary tumors.25 These gene
amplifications, which are heterogeneous among cancerous cells in the same tumor,26 are
related to sensitization of the AR signaling pathway to lower levels of androgens. On the
other hand, AR and AR-regulated genes have been shown to be upregulated in prostate
cancer xenografts after castration without any increase in the number of gene copies,22, 27
suggesting that AR amplification is not the primary mechanism of the paradoxical
upregulation of certain AR target genes after castration in these models.22
AR mutations

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Multiple early studies evaluating the prevalence of AR gene mutations have demonstrated
variable results.28–30 Most mutations are located in the ligand-binding domain (LBD),
providing a mechanistic explanation for the development of resistance to anti-androgen
therapy. The results of more recent studies provide support for the hypothesis that the
absence of androgens or the presence of anti-androgens acts as selective pressure for
emergence of mutations in the AR gene. Various AR mutations documented in mCRPC are
related to decreased specificity of AR-ligand interaction, allowing AR activation by
alternative steroidal molecules, including estrogens, corticosteroids, and progesterone.31, 32
The NH2 terminal region, which is known to be critical for the interaction of AR with coregulators, has also been shown to harbor mutations.33 Moreover, mutation analysis
identified a 5–amino acid core sequence located in the NH2 terminal region, W435L, that
can mediate androgen-independent AR activation.34
AR splice variants
Identification of AR splice variants in cell lines and tumor tissues derived from patients with
CRPC provides an additional mechanistic explanation for the development of CRPC.35, 36
Many of these variants result from insertion of cryptic exons downstream of the coding
sequences for the DNA binding domain or from deletion of exons coding for the LBD,
leading to the formation of an AR molecule lacking the LBD.37, 38 The regulation of variant
AR expression is poorly understood, although suppression of LBD by an androgen

antagonist is known to cause increased expression of AR variants in prostate cancer cell
lines.39 Sun et al. suggested that activation of AR variants leads to upregulation of
steroidogenic enzymes, providing prostate cancer cells with higher levels of AR ligands.38
AR variants are also believed to increase the expression of AR-regulated genes in the
absence of any ligand, providing an explanation for the activated AR signaling pathway in
CRPC.38, 39

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Hu et al. recently used LNCaP95 and VCaP prostate cancer cells to prove that inhibition of
AR by either siRNA or enzalutamide leads to upregulation of the ARV7 ligand, one of the
most frequently observed AR variants in clinical specimens.39 Of note, full-length AR and
ARV7 are expressed differently in each cell line. Full-length AR activates pathways related
to metabolism, biosynthesis, and secretion, whereas ARV7 increases the expression of cellcycle genes, including the activator of the M-phase check point UBE2C.39 Moreover, when
LuCaP35CR xenografts were treated with abiraterone acetate, both full-length AR and
ARV7 were upregulated, but the expression of UBE2C paralleled only the expression of
ARV7. This relationship was also demonstrated in clinical prostate cancer samples
following ADT.39 Inhibition of AR in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells did not induce
activation of AR variants, providing an explanation for why some xenografts respond to AR
suppression with tumor growth inhibition. In a recent report by Li et al.40, a 48-kb deletion
in AR intron 1 in a subset of cells in the heterogeneous CWR-R1 cell line which was related
to the expression of the AR1/2/3/CE3 splice variant (AR-V7/AR3). Following enzalutamide
treatment, the AR-V7/AR3–expressing clone expanded and the presence of this variant led
to tumor growth during ADT. Of interest is that treatment of AR-V7/AR3–enriched LNCaP
cells with high concentrations of DHT caused upregulation of PSA but downregulation of
M-phase genes, including UBE2C, CDCA5, and CCNA2. These results implicate
expression of AR splice variants in the pathogenesis of CRPC, especially after enzalutamide
treatment.40
Post-translational modifications of AR
Other possible mechanisms related to persistent AR transcriptional activity during ADT are
post-translational alterations of AR, especially phosphorylation. Guo et al. suggested that
Src-induced phosphorylation of ARY534 can lead to both AR sensitization to low levels of
androgens and androgen-independent activation of AR.41 Moreover, it is believed that Etk, a
non-receptor tyrosine kinase and downstream effector of Src and PI3K, is upregulated
during ADT and phosphorylates AR at Y534 and Y551/552, stabilizing it and promoting its
activity under androgen-depleted conditions.42
AR co-regulators and collaborating factors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Another critical mechanism implicated in the development of CRPC is the interaction
between AR and co-regulators. Wang et al. showed in a castrate-resistant LNCaP derivative
that AR directly regulates M phase genes including CDC20, CDK1, and UBE2C,
inactivating the M-phase check point and promoting tumor growth in xenografts.43
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed enhanced activities of the AR costimulator MED1 and of the FoxA1 and GATA2 AR collaborating factors in castrationresistant cells, whereas silencing of these factors decreased UBE2C mRNA levels.43 Results
from this study indicate that the distinctive pattern of AR transcriptional activity in castrateresistant cells is determined largely by co-activator stimulation and accompanying
chromatin modifications. It is interesting that interleukin 6–mediated nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCoA1, or SRC-1) phosphorylation promotes AR-dependent transcription in a
ligand-independent manner, whereas MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of this co-activator
may increase its affinity for AR, contributing to disease recurrence and CRPC.44

Alternatively, it is known that bicalutamide therapy reduces recruitment of the nuclear
receptor co-repressor (NCoR) in cells with increased AR22 protein, suggesting negative
feedback between AR and co-regulators. According to recent reports, NCoA2 (SRC-2)
expression is positively associated with high tumor cell proliferation and early disease
relapse.45 Downregulation of NCoA2 reduces AR target gene expression and inhibits
proliferation of AR-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells, whereas it is believed
that in AR-positive cancer cells, high levels of androgens repress NCoA2 expression.46
Finally, NCoA3 (SRC-3), which is positively associated with tumor recurrence and PI3K/
Akt activation, is known to be critical in the development of poorly differentiated prostate
cancer.47
AR transcriptional activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

During the development of CRPC, AR transcriptional activity is modified and aberrant
regulation of numerous genes that promote cell survival and proliferation occurs. Available
data indicate that AR-stimulated genes are initially repressed but subsequently rebound
during ADT. For example, Holzbeierlein et al. reported a gene-expression analysis of
prostate tumors during hormonal therapy showing that multiple AR target genes were
upregulated during ADT and were associated with clinical resistance to therapy.48
Moreover, Sharma et al. suggested that retinoblastoma protein loss and subsequent E2F
transcriptional factor stimulation can lead to deregulation of AR and androgen-independent
activation of multiple AR-stimulated genes.49 Recent reports added support to the concept
that multiple alternative oncogenic pathways can contribute to generation of AR signaling
that is hypersensitive to low levels of androgens.50

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

During AR-signaling, AR can act as either a transcriptional enhancer or repressor for
downstream target genes depending on androgen levels. For example, Cai et al. found that
with increasing androgen levels, AR directly represses transcription of the AR gene in
androgen-dependent VCaP cells by inhibiting the ARBS2 enhancer located within intron 2
of the AR gene.51 In contrast, with low androgen levels following androgen deprivation,
transcription of the AR gene increases. Additional AR target genes involved in androgen
biosynthesis, DNA synthesis and repair, cell cycle, and proliferation are similarly repressed
with high androgen levels and become de-repressed with low androgen levels. Consistent
with these activities, expression of androgen repressed genes is increased in castrateresistant VCaP–derived VCS2 cells and VCaP xenografts, and in human CRPC samples.
These data suggest a model in castrate-resistance whereby androgen levels are adequate to
enhance expression of AR-regulated genes related to cellular metabolism but insufficient to
repress expression of AR-regulated genes related to DNA replication and cellular
proliferation.51 Thus, a combination of enhanced and de-repressed AR target genes
ultimately contributes to castrate-resistant progression (Figure 1).

ALTERNATIVE GROWTH AND SURVIVAL PATHWAYS IN CRPC
During the transition from androgen-dependence to castrate-resistance, cancer cells become
driven by alternative growth signaling pathways. Many of these pathways can participate in
normal cellular processes, but can also become oncogenic in the early adaptive period after
ADT is begun.52 An increased understanding of the molecular interactions between
androgen signaling and these alternative growth and survival pathways should lead to the
identification of novel therapeutic targets.
C-myc overexpression
The proto-oncogene c-myc is a known regulator of cell growth and plays a critical role in
prostate cancer development and progression. Gurel et al. showed that c-myc is frequently

overexpressed in prostate intraepithelial lesions (PIN) with an incremental increase from
normal tissues to low-grade PIN to high-grade PIN.53 Various mouse models have shown
that c-myc overexpression in prostate luminal cells can lead to hyperplasia and PIN lesions
but not invasive carcinoma.54–56 Alternatively, genetically engineered mice that express cmyc from the ARR2PB prostate-specific promoter develop PIN that progresses to prostate
cancer with variable frequencies.57, 58 Interestingly, specific amplifications of the c-myc
gene have been confirmed in up to 72% of CRPC59 and ADT has been suggested to increase
the incidence of these amplifications.60 Finally, Bernard et al. demonstrated that while AR
inhibition causes downregulation of c-myc in prostate cancer cells, prostate cancer cells that
overexpress c-myc continue to grow under ADT. Together, these data support a role for
cmyc activation in the development of prostate cancer and as a potential mechanism for
CRPC development.61
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The PI3K pathway is one of the most critical in human cancer.62 Various growth factors,
including insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), regulate this
pathway, leading to activation of PI3K and the formation of PIP3. PIP3 activates AKT via
phosphorylation and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) activates a number of cellular molecules
involved in cell survival and proliferation, including MDM2, c-myc, GSK3β, NFκB, and
mTOR. PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that functions as the main inhibitor of PI3K/Akt
signaling. Genetic alterations of the PI3K signaling pathway occur in 42% and 100% of
primary and metastatic prostate cancers, respectively, suggesting this pathway is crucial in
the development of CRPC.52
In an initial study using the PbCre;Ptenloxp/loxp mouse model characterized by prostatespecific inactivation of PTEN, Wang et al., showed that 100% of mice developed invasive
adenocarcinoma between 9 and 29 weeks, 5 of 11 had lymph node metastasis between 12
and 29 weeks, and 3 of 11 mice developed lung metastases.. Following castration, there was
a time-dependent phenotype characterized by an immediate initial increase in prostate
cancer cell apoptosis (3 to 6 days post-castration) that was gradually replaced overtime with
the outgrowth of Pten null castrate-resistant proliferative clones.63 The results of more
recent studies using Pten-knockout mice are consistent with those of this initial report,
further supporting a role for Pten loss in CRPC.64–66

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Results from PI3K, Akt, and mTOR inhibitors in clinical trials and xenograft studies67–69
suggested a potential interaction between AR and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Two recent
publications reported negative feedback regulation between AR and PI3K/Akt pathways.
First, Carver et al. initially observed that mice with prostate Pten deletion (Ptenloxp/loxp) had
lower AR levels than their wild-type littermates, whereas treatment with BEZ235, a dual
PI3K and mTOR inhibitor, and RAD001, an mTOR inhibitor, rescued AR protein levels.70
Similar results were achieved in LNCaP cells, demonstrating that PI3K pathway inhibition
can upregulate AR and activate AR target gene expression.70 Subsequent experiments in
LNCaP cells and Ptenloxp/loxp mice showed that this PI3K–AR interaction is mediated in
part by upregulation of HER3 after inhibition of PI3K.70
Second, Mulholland et al. used the PbCre;Ptenloxp/loxp model to demonstrate that Pten loss
suppresses AR transcriptional activity and generates a gene-expression profile resembling
that of the castration phenotype. A mechanism for this cross talk involved negative
regulation of EGR1, c-JUN, and EZH2 by PTEN.71 The results in both reports are consistent
with earlier studies72, 73 and clearly demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt pathway can inhibit AR
transcriptional activity and lead to castrate-resistance.

Additional experiments showed that after 7 days of enzalutamide treatment of Ptenloxp/loxp
mice, despite decreased AR transcriptional activity the tumors had not significantly
regressed and were histologically similar to those before treatment, although the treatment
was much more effective in transgenic mice with inducible c-myc.70 Further studies
revealed increased Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 in the Ptenloxp/loxp mice and in LNCaP
and LAPC4 AR-positive cells after castration and enzalutamide treatment, respectively. The
same treatment did not increase pAkt in PC-3 cells, which are AR negative.70
Similarly, Mulholland et al. used the PbCre;Ptenloxp/loxp model to show that castrateresistant cancer developed in the regions of the prostate with combined Pten and AR loss. In
contrast, AR-positive regions contained lower levels of pAkt with less cell proliferation after
castration. These observations led to the conclusion that active AR transcriptional activity
can inhibit phosphorylation of Akt to activate a potent oncogenic pathway.71 Both groups of
investigators attributed this interaction to the upregulation of FKBP5 and PHLPP by
AR.70, 71 It is known that FKBP5 functions as a scaffolding protein for pAkt and PHLPP,
promoting pAkt dephosphorylation by PHLPP.74

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cross talk between the AR and PI3K/Akt pathways supports the rationale for combining AR
and PI3/Akt inhibitors in CRPC. Although BEZ235 and enzalutamide modestly inhibit
LNCaP cell proliferation as single agents, the combination significantly decreased cell
numbers via apoptosis in vitro. In LNCaP xeongrafts, the combination produced a 24%
reduction of tumor volume compared with vehicle-only or single therapy (i.e., BEZ235 or
castration only), which resulted in 28%, 30%, and 31% increases in tumor volume,
respectively.70 Mulholland et al. compared treatment of Ptenloxp/loxp mice and Ptenloxp/loxp
mice carrying AR deletion (Ptenloxp/loxpARL/Y) with rapamycin only, castration only, or the
combination. They found significantly enhanced tumor regression in the combinationtherapy group relative to that in the two single therapy groups in both models.71 Despite
these encouraging results, recent data indicate complex adaptive resistance pathways to
PI3K/mTOR inhibition in vivo, and clinical data are lacking.75
Other growth and survival pathways contributing to CRPC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The RAS/MAPK pathway has also been implicated in prostate cancer development,
progression, and metastasis. RAS signaling is known to decrease the androgen dependence
of LNCaP cells76 and to promote metastasis in DU145 cells, and tissue specimens from
patients with mCRPC display higher levels of pMAPK, a downstream target of RAS
signaling.77 According to a recent report from Mulholand et al., the RAS/MAPK pathway
was activated in 43% of primary prostate cancer samples and 90% of metastatic samples.
Phospho-MAPK levels were more prominent in tissues derived from patients who had
received ADT and were mainly observed in the basal cell compartment.78 Moreover,
conditionally activated K-ras in the prostatic epithelium of transgenic mice (K-rasL/W) is not
sufficient to promote prostate cancer development. However, when K-rasL/W mice were
crossed with PbCre;Ptenloxp/loxp mice, simultaneous deletion of Pten and activation of RAS
led to the development of poorly differentiated carcinoma within 10 weeks.78 In contrast
with the PbCre;Ptenloxp/loxp mice, PbCre;Ptenloxp/loxpK-rasL/W mice developed lung and
liver metastases with 100% penetrance but not bone metastasis, although their expression of
AR and AR-targeted genes was much lower. Histologic and gene-expression analysis of
cancer tissues showed that expression of mesenchymal markers, including N-cadherin, and
cell-cycle genes, including UBE2C, was greater than in PbCre;Ptenloxp/loxp mice, suggesting
that RAS pathway activation promotes the de-differentiation of prostate cancer cells.
Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a secreted cytokine that is implicated in various
cellular processes, including cell proliferation and cancer progression.79, 80 Several studies
have suggested that in normal epithelial cells and early-stage cancers, TGF-β signaling may

be growth suppressive.79, 81 In advanced prostate cancer, however, TGF-β1 levels are
increased, suggesting a growth promoting role.82–84 It has also been shown that the
expression of an isoform of this cytokine, TGF-β3, is increased in prostate cancer and that
TGF-β3 signaling is upregulated in CRPC.85 Androgens regulate TGF-β1 gene transcription
through positive and negative androgen response elements in the TGF-β1 promoter.86, 87
However, AR-mediated TGF-β1 expression in the context of CRPC is not well understood.
Recent data support the idea that TGF-β cytokines can activate the PI3K pathway, although
the role of SMAD molecules in this interaction is not clear.88, 89 One report suggested that
the TGF-β and PI3K pathways contribute to EMT, which is believed to be important in
CRPC pathogenesis.90 Among the most important intracellular mediators of TGF-β
signaling are the SMAD isoforms. Ding et al. used a transgenic mouse model to evaluate the
role of SMAD4 in prostate cancer progression and metastatic potential. In prostate
intraepithelial neoplastic lesions in PTENloxp/loxp mice, TGF-β signaling is upregulated and
these lesions are characterized by increased SMAD4 expression.91 Interestingly, SMAD4
was previously reported to be downregulated in human prostate cancer metastasis, and
epigenetic silencing of the SMAD4 promoter was associated with advanced disease.92 Ding
et al. found that Pten−/−Smad4−/− mice developed earlier and more aggressive invasive
adenocarcinoma than Pten−/− mice, while Smad4−/− mice did not develop prostate cancer,
Gene-expression analysis of these models showed that cyclin D1 and SPP1 were
upregulated in Pten−/−Smad4−/− tumors, leading to an increased proliferation index.91

The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is dysregulated in several types of cancer, including colorectal,
liver, and prostate cancer.93, 94 In one study, abnormal β-catenin expression was observed in
23% of tumor samples derived from radical prostatectomies and in 38% of CRPCs and was
found to be related to high Gleason scores.95 β-Catenin activates TCF/LEF-1 transcriptional
activity and upregulates genes such as MYC, MMP7, and VEGF. On the other hand, βcatenin is an important component of cadherin cell adhesion complexes which play a critical
role in the development of EMT and CRPC.96 A functional relationship between Wnt/βcatenin signaling and EMT has also been suggested.97 Among the Wnt/β-catenin target
genes are the transcriptional factors Twist-related proteins 1 and 2 and the zinc finger
protein SNAI2, which downregulate E-cadherin, potentially contributing to EMT.98

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Despite extensive research, there are conflicting results regarding the cross talk between AR
and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Some studies suggest that AR activation leads to increased βcatenin nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity.99, 100 Other studies indicate that
stimulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling leads to increased AR expression via TCF/LEF-1
binding sites on the AR promoter101 and also upregulates AR target genes.91, 92 However,
AR has also been shown to compete with TCF/LEF-1 for β-catenin binding and therefore
inhibit β-catenin/TCF–dependent signaling.102, 103 Consistent with the latter findings,
Chesire et al., in an early study involving experiments in prostate and non-prostate cancer
cells, showed that stimulation of AR by androgens can lead to AR-mediated transcriptional
suppression of β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity, whereas activation of TCF may inhibit
the expression of AR-regulated genes. Administration of anti-androgens alleviated this ARmediated suppression of TCF transcriptional activity.104 Finally, in a recent study, nuclear
localization of β-catenin was found in 10 of 27 human tissue specimens derived from bone
metastases of mCRPC. This localization was inversely associated with AR expression,
suggesting that reduced AR expression enables β-catenin signaling.105
The IGF system has been implicated in growth regulation, apoptosis resistance, and invasion
in a number of human malignancies,106–108 but its role in the development of CRPC remains
controversial. Studies in prostate cancer cells have shown that IGF-1 may increase cancer
cell proliferation and glucose consumption, whereas inhibition of the IGF-1 receptor
(IGF-1R) suppresses prostate cancer cell invasiveness.109, 110 Xenograft studies

demonstrated that increased IGF-1R and IGF-1 can lead to androgen-independent tumor
growth111 Pandini et al. found that AR stimulation leads to increased expression and
phosphorylation of IGF-IR in AR-positive cancer cells, enhancing their proliferation and
invasiveness. More importantly, this increased AR activity was only partially blocked by
anti-androgens such as bicalutamide.112

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

IGF is known to mediate the activity of insulin and IGF-1 and -2 in normal cells, thereby
mediating increased glucose intake and glycolysis and resulting in ATP and CO2 formation
via oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast with normal cells, most cancer cells rely on
aerobic glycolysis—the Warburg effect. Aerobic glycolysis is less effective in generating
ATP compared to oxidative phosphorylation, but cancer cells effectively adapt this type of
metabolism to take up nutrients that are critical for cell proliferation and tumor growth,
including nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. At the same time, aerobic glycolysis via the
pentose phosphate pathway alleviates cellular oxidative stress, providing cancer cells with a
survival advantage.113 According to another recent study, the administration of aerobic
glycolysis inhibitors such as 3-bromopyruvate can overcome resistance to trastuzumab in
breast cancer114 while inducing cell death in myeloma cells that overexpress hexokinase II
(HKII)115. Several studies substantiate the idea that prostate cancer cells activate glycolysis
through AR and PI3K/Akt. In particular, Moon et al. showed that androgen administration
activates glycolysis and lipogenesis in LNCaP cells through PKA-mediated phosphorylation
of CREB, which leads to upregulation of HKII. In parallel, liganded AR directly stimulates
the expression of PFKFB2, a known isoform of phosphofructokinase 2 (PFK2), and PI3K/
Akt signaling is implicated in the phosphorylation of PFKFB2, promoting its kinase
function.116 On the other hand, recent data have shown that AR stimulates AMPK which is
a known negative regulator of Warburg effect117, 118. Interestingly, AR-negative cells such
as PC-3 cells exhibit lower PFK activity, higher LDH activity and consume less oxygen than
LNCaP (AR-positive) cells119. Ros et al. demonstrated that LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3
prostate cancer cells are more dependent on glucose than non-malignant RWPE1 cells.
Furthermore, inhibition of PFKFB4, another isoform of PFK2 that functions as the
phosphatase of fructose 2,6-biphosphate and promotes the pentose phosphate pathway, led
to decreased tumor growth in PC-3 xenografts. By inducing the pentose phosphate pathway,
this enzyme provides cells with enough NADPH for biomass synthesis and oxidative stress
alleviation.120 The implication is that aerobic glycolysis, driven by multiple oncogenic
pathways in prostate cancer progression and especially in the development of CRPC, may
provide us with potential markers of disease progression and therapeutic targets.

The FGF pathway is believed to play a critical role not only during prostate organogenesis
but also during prostate cancer development. FGF is known to be secreted by both stromal
and cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment, acting by paracrine and autocrine
mechanisms, respectively.121 Consistent with these data, FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) is not
expressed in benign prostate epithelium, whereas it is upregulated in 40% of poorly
differentiated adenocarcinomas.122 By using a lentiviral vector to alter stromal FGF
expression, Memarzadeh et al. showed that increased stromal FGF can lead to the enhanced
epithelial proliferation associated with AR upregulation. Moreover, when stroma
overexpressing FGF and epithelium expressing activated Akt were combined, tumor growth
was more prominent.123 Spencer et al. demonstrated the development of a spectrum of
prostate malignancies, including adenocarcinoma, that were positive for nuclear AR and
negative for synaptophysin, with lymph node and liver metastasis in mice with conditional
overexpression of FGFR1 in the prostate epithelium.124 There was a high incidence of
sarcomatoid carcinoma with relatively diffuse expression of E-cadherin, which is a
characteristic of EMT. A clinical trial with Dovitinib (TKI258), a multi-tyrosine kinase
inhibitor with high specific activity against FGF/FGFR, is currently underway in patients
with mCRPC (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01741116).

Hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor, c-Met, have been implicated in the regulation of
cell growth, cell motility, morphogenesis, and angiogenesis by autocrine and/or paracrine
mechanisms.125, 126 c-Met is highly expressed in AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines such
as PC-3 and DU145 and in basal and intermediate cells in the prostate epithelium but only
minimally expressed in AR-positive prostate cancer cells, including LNCaP and CWR22,
and in luminal cells in the prostate epithelium.127 Of note, increased c-Met expression has
been found in prostate cancer tissues with a greater incidence of staining in metastatic tumor
samples.127 Finally, Verras et al. showed that AR downregulates c-Met expression by
interfering with Sp1, a known transcriptional factor that stimulates c-Met expression.128
These data support the idea that c-Met signaling is negatively regulated by AR and is
potentially de-repressed during the development of castrate-resistance. In a recently reported
study, Cabozantinib (XL184), a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor with high-specific activity
against c-Met, produced significant responses in patients with mCRPC characterized by
improvements in bone scan, lymphadenopathy, and bone pain (PMID: 23169517).

Recent data substantiate the concept of negative cross talk between AR- and EMTpromoting pathways and that overexpression of self-renewal pathways can be sufficient for
tumor progression during ADT. Sun et al. recently reported that castration can induce EMT
in normal mouse prostate, characterized by increased expression of N-cadherin and vimentin
and by low expression of E-cadherin and the acquisition of stem cell characteristics. They
confirmed these results in LucaP35 xenografts, which showed increased TGF-β, IGF1,
FGFR2, and platelet-derived growth factor signaling after ADT. The authors also found
negative cross talk between AR and Zeb1, which may be related to EMT.129 Zhu et al.
found that long-term ADT can promote EMT and metastasis through downregulation of AR
expression, suggesting that intermittent ADT is a promising option for patients with late
disease.130 Finally, Jeter et al. showed that LNCaP cells and xenografts overexpressing
NANOG, a known self-renewal and pluripotency gene, are resistant to ADT and
characterized by c-myc and Ki-67 upregulation and AR and PSA downregulation,
suggesting that NANOG can mediate castrate-resistant progression.131

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a major structural component of caveolae that is known to interact
with critical components of multiple oncogenic pathways, including receptor tyrosine
kinases, serine/threonine kinases, phospholipases, G-coupled protein receptors, and Src
family kinases. These proteins are located in caveolar membranes, where they interact with
Cav-1 through the Cav-1 scaffolding domain.132,133 Elevated expression of Cav-1 is
associated with multiple human malignancies, including prostate cancer134, 135: Serum
Cav-1 levels are higher in men with prostate cancer than in those with benign prostate
hyperplasia,136 and high serum levels have been associated with elevated risk of cancer
recurrence after radical prostatectomy.137 Moreover, Cav-1 levels were found to be elevated
in metastatic mouse and human prostate cancer,138 and this molecule was found to be a
downstream effector of testosterone-mediated prostate cancer cell survival and clonal
growth.139 On the other hand, Cav-1 is known to be highly expressed and secreted by ARnegative cells, and increased levels of Cav-1 expression have been observed after ADT.140
Further, downregulation of Cav-1 in cell and animal models converted androgen-insensitive
metastatic mouse prostate cancer cells to an androgen-sensitive phenotype.141 Finally,
recombinant Cav-1 is taken up by prostate cancer cells and endothelial cells in vitro and
increases angiogenic activities, suggesting a significant role of Cav-1 not only in the tumor
cell but also in the tumor microenvironment.142 These data suggest that Cav-1 expression
provides a significant survival benefit for prostate cancer cells, especially on ADT.
Mechanistic studies show that Cav-1 induces the PI3K/Akt pathway by inhibiting the
phosphatases PP1 and PP2, leading to increased phosphorylation and activity of PDK1, Akt,
and Erk1/2.143 Since PI3K/Akt is a critical survival pathway for prostate cancer cells,

especially during ADT, and this explains the significance of Cav-1 expression in ARnegative cells. In a subsequent study, FGF, VEGF, and TGF-β1 downstream pathways
induced the secretion of Cav-1 in AR-negative cells. Cav-1 upregulates multiple oncogenic
pathways through PI3K/Akt and mRNA stabilization, suggesting the presence of a positive
feedback loop between Cav-1 and these oncogenic pathways.144 In accord with these
findings, Tahir et al. showed that sunitinib and dasatinib treatment of PC-3 and DU145 cells
and xenografts decreased Cav-1 expression in cells and serum Cav-1 levels, respectively, in
mice and serum Cav-1 levels were positively associated with tumor growth. Finally, the coadministration of anti-Cav-1 antibody with sunitinib and dasatinib led to greater tumor
regression than did either treatment alone, further supporting the concept that Cav-1
mediates activation of multiple oncogenic pathways in the prostate cancer cell.145 Recently,
Tahir et al. demonstrated an interaction between Cav-1 and LRP6 in the cellular membrane,
which leads to the activation of IGF-1R/IR and results in stimulation of Akt-mTORC1—
mediated activation of aerobic glycolysis that includes upregulation of HK2 and GLUT3146.
These data, combined with the latest discoveries implying the participation of aerobic
glycolysis in prostate cancer progression, suggest a possible role of Cav-1 as an inducer of
multiple oncogenic pathways, with aerobic glycolysis being the final target (Figure 2).

CONCLUSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Metastatic prostate cancer remains an incurable disease since in the majority of cases it
eventually progresses upon ADT, while no chemotherapy or target agent has presented
significant efficacy against CRPC. Moreover, there are no reliable biomarkers to monitor
disease progression or guide the therapeutic decisions. The evolution of CRPC involves both
androgen-stimulated and -repressed genes related to numerous alternative growth and
survival pathways activated during the development of this disease upon ADT. The
interactions between AR signaling and alternative survival pathways are cell-type and
context-dependent and currently under extensive investigation. These oncogenic pathways,
e.g., PI3K/Akt, are differentially activated in prostate tumors and ADT provides selective
pressure in favor of castrate-resistant growth. Extrapolation of this complex information will
hopefully lead to the discovery of new markers for disease monitoring and novel and
combined therapies targeting critical pathways which provide survival advantage to prostate
cancer cells.

Figure 1. Androgen deprivation therapy initiates alterations in gene expression profiles in
prostate cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Androgen deprivation therapy results in recalibration of prostate cancer tissue androgen
levels that leads to alterations in androgen receptor (AR)-driven gene expression that may
contribute to castrate-resistant prostate cancer. AR variants (ARVs) may contribute to
altered gene expression.
