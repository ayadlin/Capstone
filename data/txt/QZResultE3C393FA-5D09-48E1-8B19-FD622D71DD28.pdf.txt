Breaks and Abrogate Senescence in Murine Mesothelial Cells

Abstract
SV40 virus has emerged as a potential cofactor with asbestos
in the development of diffuse malignant mesothelioma, but its
precise role in the pathogenesis of this tumor is unclear. SV40
large T antigen is known to inactivate cellular proteins
involved in DNA damage and senescence, including p53 and
pRb. We hypothesize that SV40 oncoproteins will sensitize
mesothelial cells to DNA damage induced by asbestos or
chemotherapeutic agents. SV40 oncoprotein expression in
murine mesothelial cell lines enhanced spontaneous and
asbestos-induced double-strand breaks, indicated by ;-H2AX
foci, and potentiated micronucleus formation. Mesothelial
cells exposed to asbestos or bleomycin for 96 h acquired
senescent-like morphology and displayed elevated senescenceassociated B-galactosidase activity, reduced bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, and reduced colony formation.
SV40 oncoprotein expression abrogated the senescent phenotype, and transfected cell lines showed an increase in both
BrdUrd incorporation and colony formation after prolonged
DNA damage. Murine mesothelial cell lines lacking wild-type
p53 due to a point mutation or gene rearrangement also failed
to senesce in response to asbestos or chemotherapeutic
agents. In addition, stress-induced senescence in human
mesothelial cell lines was impaired by SV40 oncoprotein
expression (MeT-5A), p53 small interfering RNA, or spontaneous p53 mutation (REN). These studies suggest that exposure
to DNA-damaging agents can induce senescence in both
murine and human mesothelioma cell lines and suggest a
major, although not exclusive, role for p53 in this response.
SV40 virus may contribute to mesothelioma progression by
impairing stress-induced senescence, in part through p53
inactivation, thereby favoring survival and proliferation of
mesothelial cells that have sustained DNA damage. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Diffuse malignant mesothelioma arises from mesothelial cells
lining the pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial cavities and is highly
resistant to current therapies. No precursor lesion has been
identified and mesotheliomas are rarely diagnosed until advanced
stages; as a result, prognosis is poor and survival is limited to less
than 1 year after diagnosis (1). Although studies have firmly
established a link between mesothelioma and asbestos exposure
(2), mesothelioma occurs in fewer than 10% of exposed individuals
(3). Although the exact mechanism of mesothelioma pathogenesis

is not fully understood, genotoxic effects of asbestos fibers are
hypothesized to play a role (4). Exposure of mesothelial cells to
biopersistent asbestos fibers can result in iron-catalyzed generation
of free radicals during direct fiber-target cell interactions (reviewed
in ref. 5). Alternatively, mesothelial cells may be damaged indirectly
by reactive oxygen species released by chronic inflammatory cells
(5). Although asbestos fibers have been shown to induce DNA
breakage and chromosomal damage in human and rodent
mesothelial cells in vitro (6, 7), recent work suggests that asbestos
may also promote survival of damaged mesothelial cells via
induction of tumor necrosis factor-a and nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB;
ref. 8). SV40 virus has been proposed to act as a cofactor with
asbestos in mesothelioma pathogenesis, potentially through
inactivation of the p53 and pRb tumor suppressor gene products
and up-regulation of signaling pathways associated with immortalization and survival (9, 10).
p53 and pRb play central roles in cellular responses to DNA
damage, controlling pathways leading to cell cycle arrest, death by
apoptosis, or senescence (11, 12). Unlike the majority of solid
tumors, mesotheliomas rarely exhibit p53 mutations, and no pRb
mutations have been described (13), although the presence of SV40
T antigen (Tag) in more than 50% of human mesotheliomas (14) is
predicted to inactivate both p53 and pRb (15, 16). Additionally,
several lines of evidence in vitro and in vivo suggest a role for p53
inactivation in mesothelioma pathogenesis. In human mesothelioma cell lines, inactivating point mutations of p53 are associated
with loss of the G1-S checkpoint following ionizing radiation (17),
and a spontaneous p53 mutation in a murine mesothelial cell
line resulted in increased micronucleus formation following
exposure to crocidolite asbestos or ionizing radiation (18). p53
deficiency has been shown to increase the incidence and reduce
the latency of asbestos-induced murine mesotheliomas (19), and
Li-Fraumeni family members heterozygous for mutant p53 show
a slightly increased risk of mesothelioma following asbestos
exposure (20).
We hypothesize that inactivation of p53 and pRb by SV40 Tag
would potentiate DNA damage induced by asbestos fibers or
chemotherapeutic agents. Asbestos fibers have been shown to
induce DNA damage, cell cycle arrest (8), DNA repair activity (21),
and apoptosis (22) in mesothelial cells. Chemotherapeutic agents,
such as bleomycin or camptothecin, are used to target rapidly
dividing tumor cells, although inactivation of pathways governing
DNA damage response or apoptosis may enhance resistance to
chemotherapy (23, 24). Although chemotherapeutic agents have
been shown to induce telomere-independent (stress-induced)
senescence in human and rodent cells (25), little is known about
the ability of asbestos fibers to induce this response in mesothelial
cells. In this study, we sought to investigate the consequences of
SV40 oncoprotein expression and p53 inactivation on the fate of
mesothelial cells exposed to asbestos fibers or chemotherapeutic
agents.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfections. Murine mesothelial cell lines D9 and D7
and malignant mesothelioma cell lines (7, 40) were isolated as described
previously (18, 26). SV40-transformed fibroblasts (SVT2), SV40-immortalized human mesothelial cells (MeT-5A), and a human mesothelioma cell
line (H28) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). The REN human mesothelioma cell line was a generous gift
of Dr. Steven Albelda (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). D9, 40,
7, 7T, and SVT2 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 10 units/mL/10 Ag/mL penicillin/streptomycin,
and 10 Ag/mL gentamicin. D7 and D7T cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented as above, with 1.25% Medium 199, 2 ng/mL epidermal
growth factor, and 0.04% insulin/transferrin/selenium (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). H28 and REN cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS,
2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin. MeT-5A was maintained in DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS and
penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere
at 37jC, 94% air/6% CO2. D7 and 7 cells were cotransfected with pSP189,
which encodes SV40 large and small Tags (generously provided by
Dr. Anatoly Zhitkovich, Brown University, Providence, RI; ref. 27), and
pTK-Hygro (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA), and stable subclones were isolated following selection with 500 Ag/mL
hygromycin B (Sigma).
Growth characteristics and treatments of mesothelial cell lines. Cell
counts were done in triplicate using phase-contrast microscopy to
determine doubling time. Crocidolite asbestos fibers obtained from stocks
originally prepared and characterized by the International Union Against
Cancer were purchased from Duke Scientific (Palo Alto, CA). Fiber lengths
ranged from 0.1 to >35 Am (28). Murine cells were exposed to asbestos or
bleomycin sulfate (LKT Labs, St. Paul, MN) in serum-free phenol red–free
RPMI 1640 supplemented as for normal growth medium; cells were
exposed to topotecan (LKT Labs) in phenol red–free RPMI 1640/2% FBS.
Human cells were exposed to chemotherapeutic agents in phenol red–free
RPMI 1640/2% FBS, except for MeT-5A, which was treated in RPMI 1640/
10% FBS.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated using Tri Reagent
(Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), reprecipitated with
0.4 mol/L LiCl/50% isopropanol, washed in 80% ethanol, and resuspended
in autoclaved 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Total RNA was
reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and 0.5 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphate (Promega,
Madison, WI) for 30 min at 42jC. PCR was done using 200 ng cDNA per
20 AL reaction containing 1.0 mmol/L MgCl2 and 100 nmol/L each of
forward and reverse primers. Reactions were heated to 95jC for 5 min,
cycled at 95jC (30 s), 60jC (30 s), and 72jC (90 s) for 30 cycles, and
incubated at 72jC for 10 min. PCR products were separated on 3% agarose
gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
Western blotting. Equal quantities of protein were electrophoresed in
2 Laemmli buffer, transferred to Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and blotted for SV40 oncoproteins
(pAb 108; 1:100), p53 (FL-393; 1:1,000 or DO-1; 1:1,000; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) g-tubulin (GTU-88; 1:5,000; Sigma), or
h-actin (AC-15; 1:1,000; Sigma). Visualization and densitometry were done
using the LiCOR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and software (LiCOR,
Lincoln, NE).
Coimmunoprecipitation. After preclearing with mouse serum (Sigma)
or rabbit serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 1:1 Protein A/G
Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), protein extracts were incubated
overnight with primary antibody (FL-393 or pAb 108) and 1:1 Protein A/G
Agarose. After centrifugation and washes in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer and PBS, pellets were resuspended in 2 Laemmli buffer and
resolved using SDS-PAGE.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100, and blocked in 5% normal goat serum/
0.1% BSA/0.1% Tween 20. After incubation in primary antibody (pAb 108 or

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

Ab-4; 1:500; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat antimouse IgG (1:1500; Invitrogen), coverslips were stained with 300 nmol/L
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and visualized using fluorescence
microscopy. For g-H2AX immunofluorescence, 0.5% Triton X-100 permeabilizations were included after the primary and secondary antibodies. Foci
were counted in a minimum of 100 cells per coverslip using confocal
microscopy and Renaissance 410 software (Microcosm, Inc. Columbia, MD).
Nuclear aberrations and cell viability. Cells were exposed to
10 Ag/cm2 asbestos or 1 Ag/mL bleomycin sulfate for 24 to 96 h, centrifuged
to pellet floating cells, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were
permeabilized and stained with DAPI before scoring for micronuclei and
apoptotic nuclei. Cell viability was quantitated using 400 nmol/L calcein
AM (Invitrogen) and a SpectraMax M2 fluorescence microtiter plate
reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), with excitation/emission at 485/
525 nm.
Senescence-associated B-galactosidase activity. Senescence-associated
h-galactosidase (SA h-gal) staining was done as described by Dimri et al.
(29) and incubated for 6 h (MeT-5A) or 24 h at 37jC in the absence of CO2.
A minimum of 300 cells per coverslip was scored for senescent morphology
and cytoplasmic blue staining using bright-field and phase-contrast
microscopy.
Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Cells were treated as indicated
and 10 Amol/L bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma) was added 1 h (murine
cell lines) or 3 h (human cell lines) before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde.
Cells were permeabilized, blocked in 2% FBS/PBS, and incubated at 37jC in
anti-BrdUrd (3D4; 1:200; PharMingen, San Jose, CA)/3% BSA/1 mmol/L
MgCl2/125 units/mL Benzonase (Sigma). After incubation with Alexa Fluor
488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000), cells were stained with DAPI. A minimum
of 300 cells per coverslip was scored using fluorescence microscopy. For
longer labeling, BrdUrd (1 Ag/mL) and uridine (1 mg/mL; Sigma) were
added 48 h before fixation.
Colony formation assay. Cells were trypsinized and viability was
determined using trypan blue exclusion. Five hundred viable cells were
replated into 100-mm dishes. After 6 days, colonies were fixed in methanol,
stained with Giemsa (Sigma), and scored (>30 cells per colony). Growth
properties of surviving cells were examined 6 days after replating onto
coverslips and assessing for viability, BrdUrd incorporation, SA h-gal
activity, or Tag expression.
Small interfering RNA knockdown of p53. The pSUPER.retro.puro
knockdown constructs, containing hairpin sequences complementary to
green fluorescent protein (GFP) or human p53, and retroviral packaging
plasmids pVSV-G and pHIT60 were generously provided by Dr. Anatoly
Zhitkovich. The packaging plasmids and knockdown constructs were
cotransfected into the 293T packaging cell line using LipofectAMINE Plus
(Invitrogen). Retroviral supernatants were collected 24 and 48 h posttransfection and incubated with the H28 cell line in the presence of 8 Ag/mL
polybrene (Sigma). Cells expressing GFP small interfering RNA (siRNA) or
p53 siRNA were obtained following selection with 2.0 Ag/mL puromycin
(Sigma).

Results
Expression of SV40 oncoproteins alters growth properties of
murine mesothelial cells. To investigate the effects of SV40
oncoprotein expression in mesothelial cells, we expressed SV40
large (Tag) and small (tag) Tags in preneoplastic (D7) and
neoplastic (7) murine mesothelial cells. Consistent with their
mesothelial origin, all cell lines expressed WT1 mRNA (Fig. 1A). We
compared the expression profiles of cell cycle regulatory genes
implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant mesothelioma in D7,
D7T, 7, and 7T cells and D9, an immortalized, nontumorigenic
mesothelial cell line (18). Only D9 cells expressed p16INK4a (Fig. 1A),
a cell cycle regulatory gene whose expression is lost in 60% to 100%
of human mesotheliomas, most often due to small homozygous
deletions (30). D9, D7, and the transfected cell line D7T retained
expression of p15INK4b and p19ARF (Fig. 1A), the murine homologue

of human p14ARF . In contrast, murine mesothelioma cell lines 7
and 7T did not express p19ARF (Fig. 1A), which is often codeleted
with p16INK4a in human malignant mesotheliomas (31). All cell
lines expressed p53 (Fig. 1A), similar to the majority of human
malignant mesotheliomas (13). As expected, D7T and 7T cells
expressed Tag mRNA (Fig. 1A) and both large and small SV40 Tags
(Fig. 1B). Large Tag localized to the nuclei of transfected cells
(Fig. 1C), and its expression correlated with stabilization of wildtype (WT) p53 protein (Fig. 1B and C). Coimmunoprecipitation
confirmed the interaction between Tag and WT p53 (Fig. 1B). An
antibody specific for the mutant conformation of p53 was reactive
only with D9 cells (Fig. 1C; ref. 18); the murine mesothelioma cell
line, 40, did not express mutant or WT p53 (Fig. 1C).
Tag expression was also associated with morphologic alterations:
D7T cells are smaller and more fibroblast-like than D7 cells
(Fig. 1D), whereas 7T cells are smaller and more epithelial-like than
7 cells. Large, multinucleated cells were present in the 7T cell line
under normal growth conditions (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the role
of SV40 Tag in binding and inactivating cell cycle regulatory
proteins to promote cell proliferation (32), SV40 oncoprotein

expression was associated with reduced cell doubling time, from
17.5 to 14.0 h in preneoplastic mesothelial cells and from 17.1 to
8.9 h in mesothelioma cells. In addition, transfection of D7 cells
with SV40 oncoproteins abrogated contact-inhibited cell growth,
and both D7T and 7T cells grew to higher saturation densities than
their respective parental cell lines (data not shown).
SV40 oncoproteins enhance asbestos and bleomycin-induced
DNA damage. We predicted that inactivation of p53 by SV40 Tag
would enhance DNA damage in mesothelial cells, as an inactivating
p53 point mutation in a murine mesothelial cell line enhanced
sensitivity to asbestos-induced micronuclei, as well as to ionizing
radiation (18). Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in doublestrand break (DSB) repair show enhanced sensitivity to chrysotile
asbestos, suggesting a role for DSB in asbestos-induced DNA
damage (33). To examine the effect of SV40 oncoprotein expression
on spontaneous and induced DSB, we compared phosphorylation of
histone H2AX at COOH-terminal Ser139 in parental and transfected
cell lines. Discrete foci containing phospho-H2AX (g-H2AX) form
rapidly after induction of DSB and are considered to be a sensitive
and specific indicator of DSB (34).

Figure 2. SV40 oncoproteins enhance spontaneous and asbestos-induced DNA DSBs. A, time course of g-H2AX foci formation after asbestos or bleomycin exposure.
Cells were exposed to 10 Ag/cm2 asbestos or 1 Ag/mL bleomycin for 3 or 24 h. Cells were scored as having 1 to 10 (5), 11 to 20 ( ), or >20 (n) foci per cell.
Columns, average percentage of cells in each category of three coverslips; bars, SE. B, statistical analysis of g-H2AX foci formation after 24 h using Student’s

We examined the consequences of SV40 oncoprotein expression
on spontaneous DSB and on DSB induced by asbestos fibers or
bleomycin, a radiomimetic chemotherapeutic agent that induces
DSB via transition metal-dependent generation of free radicals (35).
Relative to D7, increased spontaneous DSB were observed within
24 h in D7T as well as in both neoplastic cell lines (Fig. 2A). In both
parental cell lines, asbestos fibers increased g-H2AX foci within
24 h (Fig. 2A and B) and expression of SV40 oncoproteins increased
sensitivity to asbestos-induced DSB in preneoplastic cells (Fig.
2A and B). Expression of SV40 oncoproteins in mesothelioma cells
significantly increased the percentage of cells containing 11 to 20
foci and >20 foci (Fig. 2B). In contrast, although bleomycin
produced DSB more rapidly and efficiently than asbestos, SV40
oncoproteins did not further increase bleomycin-induced DSB in
either cell line (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that, in both
preneoplastic and neoplastic mesothelial cell lines, SV40 oncoprotein expression potentiates asbestos-induced DSB. As persistent or
unrepaired DSB could result in micronuclei and chromosomal
aberrations, we examined formation of micronuclei in cell lines
exposed to asbestos or bleomycin for 24, 60, or 96 h. SV40
oncoproteins enhanced asbestos-induced micronuclei in both
preneoplastic and neoplastic cells and enhanced bleomycininduced micronuclei only in preneoplastic cells (Fig. 3A).
SV40 oncoproteins alter toxicity in mesothelial cells
exposed to asbestos or bleomycin. As DSB are considered to
be the most lethal form of DNA damage, we compared cell viability
during a 96-h exposure to asbestos fibers or bleomycin. D7 and 7
cells treated with asbestos or bleomycin showed a reduction in cell
viability relative to untreated cells (Fig. 3B). SV40 oncoproteins
protected from asbestos toxicity, particularly in preneoplastic
mesothelial cells. In contrast, SV40 oncoprotein expression
enhanced bleomycin toxicity in preneoplastic cells and only slightly

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

decreased bleomycin toxicity in neoplastic cells. Consistent with a
recent report showing increased resistance of human mesothelioma cells to asbestos-induced toxicity in the presence of Tag or
SV40 (36), SV40 oncoprotein expression protected preneoplastic
and, to a greater extent, neoplastic mesothelial cells from asbestosinduced apoptosis during a 96-h exposure. (Fig. 3C, compare 7 and
7T). In contrast, transfected cell lines exhibited increased
bleomycin-induced apoptosis compared with parental cell lines,
especially at 60 and 96 h (Fig. 3C).
SV40 oncoproteins abrogate stress-induced mesothelial cell
senescence. After prolonged exposure to asbestos or bleomycin, a
subpopulation of parental cells displayed enlarged, flattened
morphology characteristic of replicative or stress-induced senescence (37, 38) and elevated SA h-gal activity, which has been widely
used as a marker of senescent cells in culture (29). After prolonged
exposure to asbestos or bleomycin, both parental lines showed
elevated SA h-gal activity relative to control cells (Fig. 4B), particularly in response to bleomycin. In contrast, transfected cell lines
did not show senescent morphology or SA h-gal activity after
asbestos or bleomycin treatment.
SA h-gal expression was accompanied by a decrease in BrdUrd
incorporation in the parental cell lines (Fig. 4B), whereas the
percentage of transfected cells undergoing DNA synthesis after a
96-h exposure to asbestos or bleomycin was significantly higher.
We also assessed the colony-forming ability of surviving cells as an
indicator of proliferative capacity after DNA damage. Preneoplastic
and, to a lesser extent, neoplastic mesothelial cells showed a
reduction in colony formation after treatment with asbestos or
bleomycin (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the relative increase in BrdUrd
incorporation in the presence of SV40 oncoproteins, transfected
cell lines showed increased colony formation compared with
parental lines, particularly in response to asbestos (Fig. 4C).

SV40 Oncoproteins Abrogate Mesothelial Cell Senescence

We observed two morphologically distinct populations of
mesothelial cells that survived prolonged asbestos or bleomycin
exposure. One population formed colonies with the morphology
of growing, untreated cells (Fig. 4D, right), whereas a second
population of enlarged, flattened cells failed to form colonies
(Fig. 4D, left). This population was not observed in colony
formation experiments using transfected cell lines, nor after
replating untreated cells, indicating that failure to form colonies
was not due to low plating density. Both populations were viable
(Fig. 4D), and cells with senescent morphology expressed SA h-gal,
whereas SA h-gal–positive cells were rarely observed in colonies
of transfected cells and were most often large and multinucleated.
As expected, cells growing in colonies incorporated BrdUrd
(Fig. 4D, right), whereas isolated cells did not, even after a 48-h
incubation (Fig. 4D, left), and all of the transfected cells growing in

colonies retained Tag expression (Fig. 4D, right). In summary,
prolonged DNA damage of murine mesothelial cells produces a
subpopulation of isolated, enlarged cells that are viable but
nonproliferating and senescent. In both preneoplastic and
neoplastic cell lines, SV40 oncoprotein expression abrogated
senescence induced in response to prolonged DNA damage.
Stress-induced senescence of human mesothelial cells is
impaired by SV40 or p53 deficiency. To extend the relevance of
our findings to human cell lines, we investigated stress-induced
senescence in a SV40-negative human mesothelioma cell line (H28)
and a SV40-immortalized human mesothelial cell line (MeT-5A). Following exposure to bleomycin or topotecan, a water-soluble camptothecin derivative, H28 showed similar dose-dependent increases in SA
h-gal activity with concomitant decreases in BrdUrd incorporation
(Fig. 5A). In contrast, SA h-gal activity in MeT-5A cells increased only

slightly in response to either chemotherapeutic agent (Fig. 5A), and
the percentage of treated MeT-5A cells undergoing DNA synthesis
after 4 days remained similar to control. These results suggest that
chemotherapeutic agents can also activate a senescence program in
human mesothelial cells that is impaired by SV40 oncoproteins.

Both the p53 and pRb pathways have been implicated in stressinduced senescence, although DNA damage may preferentially
engage the p53 pathway (39). We chose to address the role of p53 in
mesothelial cell senescence based on the documented role of p53 in
response to DNA damage, as well as on previous work suggesting a

role for p53 inactivation in asbestos-induced murine mesothelioma
(19). Because Tag simultaneously inactivates both p53 and pRb, it was
not possible to determine the relative contribution of each pathway
to mesothelial cell senescence in SV40-positive cell lines. Consequently, we evaluated stress-induced senescence in two p53-deficient
murine mesothelial cell lines: D9, which contains an inactivating p53
point mutation and expresses mutant p53 (Fig. 1C; ref. 18), and 40, a
mesothelioma cell line that contains a p53 gene rearrangement and
lacks p53 expression entirely (Fig. 1C; ref. 26). Compared with D7,
which expresses WT p53, D9 and 40 showed a drastic reduction in SA
h-gal activity after exposure to agents capable of inducing DSB,
including asbestos, bleomycin, and topotecan. (Fig. 5B). These results
suggest a major, although not necessarily exclusive, role for p53 in
stress-induced senescence in murine mesothelial cells.
The H28 mesothelioma cell line lacks expression of p16INK4a and
p14ARF due to homozygous deletions in exons 1a and 1h of the
INK4a/ARF locus but retains expression of WT p53 (40). The REN
mesothelioma cell line, similar to the murine mesothelioma cell
line 40, contains a rearranged p53 gene and lacks expression of p53
protein (Fig. 5C; ref. 41) but retains an intact INK4a/ARF locus (41).
Neither REN nor H28 cells expressed SV40 Tag mRNA or protein
(data not shown). Topotecan induced p53 stabilization in H28 and
produced a population of cells with senescent morphology and
elevated SA h-gal activity within 4 to 6 days (Fig. 5A and C). In
contrast, REN cells showed no elevation in p53 protein (Fig. 5C) or
SA h-gal activity after a 4- to 6-day exposure to topotecan (Fig. 5D;
data not shown).
To confirm a role for p53 in human mesothelioma cell senescence using isogenic cell lines, we stably expressed an siRNA
construct targeting p53 in the H28 cell line. Compared with
uninfected H28 cells or H28 cells expressing a construct targeting
GFP, expression of a p53 siRNA construct resulted in decreased p53
mRNA levels (data not shown) and a >80% decrease in p53 protein
levels on exposure to topotecan (Fig. 5B). To determine whether
p53 expression was required for stress-induced senescence in H28
cells, populations of H28 cells expressing GFP siRNA or p53 siRNA
were treated with 1.0 Amol/L topotecan for 6 days. The topotecaninduced increase in SA h-gal activity was comparable in uninfected
H28 cells and in H28 cells expressing GFP siRNA, whereas
expression of p53 siRNA was associated with decreased SA h-gal
activity (Fig. 5C). Exposure to bleomycin also induced a senescent
phenotype in H28 that was impaired in REN cells and after p53
knockdown (data not shown). These results suggest a major role
for p53 in stress-induced senescence of human mesothelioma cells
exposed to chemotherapeutic agents.

Discussion
In this study, we show that SV40 oncoprotein expression in
preneoplastic and neoplastic murine mesothelial cells enhances
both spontaneous and asbestos-induced DSB within 24 h, as well as
micronuclei induced by exposure to asbestos or bleomycin. SV40
oncoprotein expression enhanced asbestos-induced micronuclei
in both cell lines and increased bleomycin-induced micronuclei in
the neoplastic mesothelial cell line after a 96-h exposure. SV40 Tag
may potentiate DNA damage and genetic instability by inhibiting
DNA repair directly through disruption of DNA repair foci (42) or
indirectly by preventing p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and
transcriptional activation of p53 target genes involved in DNA
repair (33). Alternatively, Tag has been shown to disrupt mitotic
checkpoints necessary for maintenance of genomic stability (43).

Although the oncogenic effects of SV40 have been mostly attributed to large Tag, several lines of evidence suggest a role for
small tag in mesothelioma pathogenesis. Small tag is required for
transformation of human mesothelial cells by SV40 (44) and
for induction of mesotheliomas by SV40 virus in hamsters (45).
Asbestos and tag have been shown to independently up-regulate
activator protein-1 and NF-nB transcription factors (reviewed in
ref. 46), which are associated with cell proliferation and cell
survival, respectively. Therefore, it is possible that tag could further
enhance proliferation and survival of mesothelial cells exposed
to asbestos fibers. Recent reports have shown increased activity of
the prosurvival Akt pathway in human and murine mesotheliomas
(47), as well as higher Akt activity in SV40-positive human mesothelioma cell lines, leading the authors to suggest a correlation
between SV40 virus and cell survival in asbestos-induced mesotheliomas (48). Although our studies did not specifically address the
involvement of these or other prosurvival signaling pathways, SV40
oncoprotein expression was associated with enhanced long-term
survival of preneoplastic and neoplastic mesothelial cells after
exposure to asbestos fibers or to a chemotherapeutic agent.
DNA damage–induced senescence has been described both in
normal human fibroblasts (49) and in cell lines derived from multiple
human tumor types (39, 49). Little is known about stress-induced
senescence in malignant mesothelioma, although SV40 infection of
human mesothelial cells has been shown to bypass replicative
senescence through a Tag-dependent up-regulation of telomerase
(50). Both replicative (telomere-dependent) and stress-induced
(telomere-independent) senescence are believed to involve the
p16/pRb and ARF/p53 pathways, although few studies have
addressed stress-induced senescence in either preneoplastic or
neoplastic mesothelial cells. In this in vitro model of murine
mesothelioma, we observed a senescent phenotype in both preneoplastic and neoplastic mesothelial cells that shares several characteristics with DNA damage–induced senescence: enlargement and
flattening of cells, expression of SA h-gal, and reduced cell
proliferation as assessed by BrdUrd incorporation and colony
formation. This phenotype persisted after reculturing surviving cells
under normal growth conditions, suggesting that this growth arrest
may be permanent. Although these murine preneoplastic and
neoplastic mesothelial cell lines lack p16 and p16/p19ARF expression,
respectively, both cell lines undergo senescence in response to
asbestos and, to a greater extent, bleomycin and topotecan. These
findings do not exclude a role for the INK4a/ARF locus or pRb in
mesothelial cell senescence but suggest that inactivation of p16
alone or p16 and p19ARF is insufficient to abrogate the stress-induced
senescence response. On expression of SV40 oncoproteins, which
would be expected to disrupt p53 and pRb directly, transfected
mesothelial cells failed to senesce in response to asbestos fibers or
bleomycin and continued to incorporate BrdUrd and proliferate.
The inverse correlation between stress-induced senescence and
SV40 status was also observed in human cell lines exposed to
chemotherapeutic agents. Compared with H28, which exhibited
senescent morphology, elevated SA h-gal, and decreased DNA
synthesis after exposure to topotecan or bleomycin, an SV40immortalized human cell line (MeT-5A) exhibited only slight
alterations in SA h-gal and BrdUrd incorporation. The selected
dose ranges were sufficient to induce up to a 3-fold increase in
micronuclei in MeT-5A (data not shown), indicating that the failure
to senesce was not due to subgenotoxic doses of these
chemotherapeutic agents. Although we observed an apparent
higher background of SA h-gal activity in MeT-5A than other

Figure 5. SV40 or p53 deficiency impairs stress-induced senescence in murine and human mesothelial cells. A, SV40-immortalized human mesothelial cells
(MeT-5A) are impaired in stress-induced senescence. An SV40-negative human mesothelioma cell line (H28) and MeT-5A were evaluated for SA h-gal activity (5) and
BrdUrd incorporation (n) following a 4-d exposure to the indicated doses of topotecan or bleomycin. B, inactivation of p53 in murine mesothelial cell lines is associated
with decreased SA h-gal activity relative to control (5) after a 4-d exposure to asbestos ( ), bleomycin ( ), or topotecan (n). SA h-gal activity in D7 and D7T as
shown in Fig. 4B is presented here for comparison. C, siRNA-mediated p53 knockdown in a WT p53 human mesothelioma cell line. Human mesothelioma cell
lines with WT (H28) or mutated (REN) p53 and derivatives of H28 stably expressing GFP or p53 siRNA constructs were exposed to 1.0 Amol/L topotecan for the
indicated times (h) and processed for Western blot analysis. D, p53 knockdown impairs stress-induced senescence in human mesothelioma cells. Following a 6-d
exposure to control medium (5) or 1.0 Amol/L topotecan (n), cell lines and knockdown populations were assayed for SA h-gal activity. For all experiments, a minimum of
300 cells per coverslip was scored. Columns, average of three coverslips; bars, SE.

murine or human cell lines, we speculate that this is due to increased
lysosomal mass in a subpopulation of large, multinucleated cells,
as these cells express SV40 Tag and incorporate BrdUrd before
and after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (data not shown).
Cell lines with defined alterations in p53 were used to assess the
contribution of p53 to stress-induced mesothelial cell senescence.
Inactivation of p53 due to a point mutation (D9), gene rearrangement (40 and REN), or p53 siRNA (H28) compromised the sene-

scence response, as evaluated by morphologic changes and SA
h-gal activity. These results do not exclude a role for additional
pathways that are targeted by SV40 Tag, such as pRb, which has
been shown to play a direct role in DNA damage–induced senescence of human fibroblasts (51). Recent studies have provided
convincing evidence for senescence in vivo and its role as a tumor
suppression mechanism (52). These studies suggest that murine
and human mesothelioma cells with WT p53 can undergo growth

arrest closely resembling senescence in response to chemotherapeutic agents. Although many chemotherapeutic agents induce
apoptosis of tumor cells, the ability to undergo senescence is
also an important determinant of treatment outcome (23, 51).
Induction of senescence in mesothelioma cells expressing WT p53
may represent an alternative goal of chemotherapy, using doses
that do not induce systemic toxicity. Although the majority of
human mesotheliomas express WT p53, mesothelioma cells
expressing mutant p53 or SV40 oncoproteins may be able to
circumvent senescence induced by asbestos fibers or chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, SV40 virus may enhance survival and
proliferation of mesothelioma cells that would otherwise undergo
senescence, which may have implications for treatment of
mesotheliomas containing SV40, even if SV40 viral sequences
