ABSTRACT:
The use of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted chemotherapies
has successfully entered clinical practice and holds great promise. ADCs
consist of an antibody and toxin-drug combined together via a chemical linker.
While the antibody and drug are of vital importance in the direct elimination
of cancer cells, more advanced linker technology was instrumental in the
delivery of more potent drugs with fewer side effects. Here, we discuss the
preclinical experience as well as clinical trials, with a specific emphasis on
the clinical outcomes and side effects, in addition to linker strategies for five
different ADCs, in order to describe different approaches in the development
of this new class of anticancer agents. Brentuximab vedotin is approved
for use in Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Trastuzumab emtansine is approved
for breast cancer. Combotox, Inotuzumab Ozogamicin, and Moxetumomab
Pasudotox are in various stages of clinical development and are showing
significant efficacy in lymphoid malignancies. These ADCs illustrate the
promise and future potential of targeted therapy for presently incurable
malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

United States.
In general, ADCs comprise three components: they
are made up of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated
to a toxin via a chemical linker. The mAb allows targeted
delivery of a potent cell toxin to specific malignant
cells, thereby maximizing drug delivery while limiting
bystander effects of traditional cytotoxic agents (Figure
2). In the last few years, it has become apparent that
determining the perfect linker may be just as important
as the other components of an ADC in increasing efficacy
and decreasing toxicity.[7-9] This review describes in
detail the development of five unique ADCs, each using
a different combination of linker technology and toxin.
These examples demonstrate that various components of
an ADC are equally important in determining its efficacy
and relative safety (Table 1).[10-13]

The concept of linking an antibody to a toxin
to create a safe and effective agent against cancer cells
is not a new one. The magic bullet concept of Paul
Ehrlich is over 100 years old,[1] while the first credible
experiments linking chemotherapeutic agents to antibodies
were performed almost 55 years ago).[2] At this point,
despite all the years of research, there have only been
four antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) approved by
the FDA (Figure 1).[3-6] Brentuximab vedotin (SGN35; Adcetris™) and Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1;
Kadcycla™) were recently approved. Both revolutionized
treatment for their respective indication (relapsed
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL)/systemic anaplastic large cell
lymphoma (sALC), and Her2-positive breast cancer),
while denileukin difitox (Ontak™) and, gemtuzumab
ozogamicin (GO; Mylotarg™) have seen limited clinical
use. In fact, GO was recently taken off the market in the

DESIGN AND EFFICACY OF ANTIBODY
DRUG CONJUGATES

is interesting to note that while there are generally more
CD19-positive cancerous B-cells than CD22-positive
cells, RFB4-dgRTA is the more potent IT. This could
perhaps be explained by the far greater rate of CD22
internalization after RFB4 binding, compared to that of
CD19 after HD37 binding.[17]
Combotox was first demonstrated to be effective
in a Daudi-Lymphoma (CD19+/CD22+) SCID mouse
model, where the use of both antibodies showed a
synergistic killing effect, promoting survival to the
equivalent killing of ≥5 logs of tumor cells, more than
1 log greater than RFB4-dgRTA alone, and at least 3
logs greater than HD37-dgRTA alone.[18] These results
led to a 22 patient Phase I clinical trial for patients with
advanced or refractory Non-Hodgkin’s B-Cell Lymphoma
(NHL). The results were modestly encouraging, with 9%
of patients achieving a partial response (PR) and 23%
a minor response (MR). The main side effects from the
drug were complications caused by a Vascular Leak
Syndrome (VLS). The symptoms of VLS include edema,
pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, weight gain, anemia,
hypoalbuminemia, hypotension, and in extreme cases
multi-organ failure and death. Severe hemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS) was also observed. While three patients
died during the trial, only two of these deaths could be
directly attributed to Combotox. Additionally, 30-35% of
patients developed human anti-mouse and/or anti-RTA
antibodies (HAMA and/or HARA). Interestingly, toxic
side effects were inversely correlated with the presence of

Combotox is a mixture of ricin-coupled antibodies
against CD19 and CD22 and is effective in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia
The immunotoxin (IT) Combotox is the 1:1
mixture of two murine monoclonal IgG1 antibodies, both
individually linked to a ricin based toxin. It consists of
RFB4, a CD22 antibody, and HD37, a CD19 antibody.
Both antibodies are coupled to the toxin deglycosylated
ricin-A chain (dgRTA), via N-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyla-methyl-a-(2-pyridyldithio)toluene
(SMPT),
a
heterobifunctional, thiol-containing cross-linker. The
toxin, dgRTA, is the isolated A-chain of the ricin toxic
protein, which mediates its activity by disrupting the 60s
ribosomal subunit, thereby inhibiting protein translation.
It was later deglycosylated to reduce its hepatotoxicity.
[14] CD22 is a B-cell specific antigen involved in
regulating B-cell survival and function. It is an attractive
target, in that it is expressed on the majority of B-cell
cancers, but not by stem cell precursors (Table 2).[15]
CD19 is also a B-cell specific antigen involved in cell
signaling. It is expressed in many B-cell malignancies
and is downregulated in plasma cells and hematopoetic
stem cells, making it a similarly appealing target.[16] It

circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Patients with ≥50 CTCs/
mm3 tolerated maximum dosing without major toxicities,
while those with <50 CTCs/mm3 experienced more serious
adverse events. Patients with a history of autologous or
allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT), or radiation
therapy also had a higher mortality.[19]
Since relapsed or refractory precursor-B acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) usually has
circulating blasts cells, Combotox was next tested in this
malignancy. Combotox demonstrated its efficacy in in
vitro experiments with pre-B ALL lymphoblasts taken
from pediatric patients,[20] as well as in vivo early and
late disease pre-B ALL murine models.[21] In a Phase I
pediatric clinical trial for refractory pre-B ALL (n=17),
Combotox treatment resulted in a complete remission (CR)
for 18% of patients and hematological improvement (HI)
in 35% of patients. The main dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
was Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) in two patients
with a history of prior stem cell transplantation (SCT).
The most common adverse events were mouth sores,
rashes, and hyperbilirubinemia. A case of pancreatitis and
anaphylaxis each was also reported. Two patients died
during the trial, and both deaths were attributed to a high
leukemic burden. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
was determined as 5 mg/m2 per dose for up to three doses.
The rate of HAMA/HARA immunogenicity was 18%,
about half of that from the NHL adult trial.[22]
These encouraging results informed a subsequent
Phase I trial of single agent Combotox in adults with
B-lineage ALL. In this trial (n=17), treatment with
Combotox led to specific reductions in peripheral
leukemic blasts in most patients: even though only a 13%
(n=2) PR rate was observed, 5 patients (31%) experienced
a hematological response resulting in an overall response
rate (ORR) of 31%. The MTD of Combotox was three
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

doses of 7mg/m2 every other day. The DLT in this
trial was VLS. Other serious side effects at grade 3 or
higher included elevated liver function tests. HAMA/
HARA immunogenicity was 6%, the lowest heretofore
reported rate in any Combotox clinical trial.[23] These
trials demonstrated that Combotox has specific activity
against B-lineage ALL blasts, but single agent treatment
may not be sufficient in this rapidly progressive disease.
Subsequent in vitro studies were conducted to test its
efficacy in combination with chemotherapy in a NOD
mouse model of advanced ALL. This murine xenograft
experiment revealed that sequential administration
of Combotox with cytarabine (Ara-C) is superior to
concurrent administration and improved survival over
single agent therapy. These results informed the design of
a Phase I clinical trial for adults with relapsed or refractory
ALL that is presently accruing patients (clinicaltrials.gov
NCT01408160).[24]

Brentuximab Vedotin is an immunotoxin against
CD30 that is approved for use in Hodgkin’s
lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell
lymphoma
SGN-35 (cAC10-vcMMAE; Seattle Genetics) is
the most recent ADC to be approved by the FDA.[25]
Going by either the generic name Brentuximab Vedotin,
or the trade name, Adcetris™, SGN-35 consists of the
chimeric monoclonal IgG1 cAC10 (SGN-30) antibody,
which is specific for human CD30, conjugated to a toxin,
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).[26] CD30, part of the
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, is an ideal
target for antibody-based therapy, as it is highly expressed
on HL and sALCL, while restricted to the immune system,
399

specifically to activated lymphocytes (Table 2). MMAE is
a synthetic analog of dolastatin 10, a highly potent natural
antimitotic agent that inhibits tubulin polymerization. The
third component is the stable cathepsin B cleavable valinecitrulline dipeptide linker, with a p-aminobenzylcarbamate
spacer put in between the linker and toxin. In vitro
cytotoxicity assays on the CD30+ Karpas-299 ALCL
and L540cy HL cell lines showed that SGN-35 was both
highly potent and antigen-specific. It induced G2/M phase
growth arrest quickly followed by apoptosis. Additionally,
the drug was shown to be highly stable in human plasma
(due to the unique linker), as less than 2% of the drug was
released after a 10-day incubation. In vivo experiments
in xenograft SCID mouse models of sALCL and HL,
and a disseminated sALCL SCID mouse model, all
demonstrated dose dependent tumor regression and a high
tolerance for the drug.[27] Further in vitro studies showed

that the most effective form of SGN-35 would optimally
include four molecules of MMAE conjugated to each
antibody.[28] The linker in SGN-35 was examined in vivo
and was determined to be far more stable than previously
used disulfide and hydrazone linkers, with a half-life of
almost ten days.[29] The method of MMAE entry into the
cell was elucidated via in vitro studies, which showed that
both the mAb and MMAE were internalized into the cell
via clathrin-dependent mechanisms, while the drug was
released via cathepsin B and other lysosomal cysteine
proteases.[30] Finally, in an in vivo L540cy HL SCID
mouse model, SGN-35 was combined with either ABVD
(doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine)
or gemcitabine as a combination therapy, and showed
synergistic anti-tumor activity.[31]
These results encouraged clinical trials testing
the efficacy of SGN-35 in different CD30-positive

DNA damage or inhibiting protein translation.

malignancies. In a Phase I clinical trial with 45 patients
with either refractory HL (n=42), sALCL (n=2), or
angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma (n=1), 17 patients
had a objective response (OR=CR + PR; 38%), with 11
patients having a CR (24%), while 19 patients (42%)
had stable disease (SD). Among patients treated at the
MTD (1.8mg/kg), the OR rate was 50%. Additionally,
tumor regression was noted in 86% of evaluable patients
(36/42), while 81% of patients with disease symptoms
at baseline (13/16) experienced symptom resolution.
Serious side effects ≥grade 3 included one case each
of thrombocytopenia, prostatitis, febrile neutropenia,
hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, and presumed sepsis
leading to death. The more common grade 1/2 side effects
included fatigue, pyrexia, diarrhea, and neutropenia.
Peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) and associated
adverse events were observed in 16 patients (36%).[32]
Since then, two Phase II clinical trials have been
reported. One hundred and two patients with refractory
HL post autologous SCT were given 1.8 mg/kg SGN35 every 3 weeks. The ORR was 75% and the CR rate
was 34%, while tumor reduction was seen in 94% of
patients. Thirty-one of 102 patients were alive and
free of documented progressive disease after a median
observation time of 18.5 months. Serious side effects
≥grade 3 included PSN, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,
and anemia. Other common adverse events included
nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, vomiting, arthralgia,
pruritus, myalgia, and peripheral motor neuropathy
(PMN).[33] Similarly, 58 patients with refractory
sALCL were given 1.8 mg/kg SGN-35 every 3 weeks.
The ORR was 86%, with a 57% CR rate while tumor
reductions were seen in 97% of patients. In the 17 patients
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with B-symptoms, 82% achieved resolution in their
symptoms. Serious side effects ≥grade 3 were similarly
PSN, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue,
and pain in the extremities. Interestingly, 4 patients had
tumor flares.[34] In an attempt to reduce toxicity and
increase potency, 44 patients diagnosed with refractory
HL (n=38), sALCL (n=5), or peripheral T-cell lymphoma
not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) were enrolled in a
weekly dosing Phase I clinical trial. SGN-35 elicited a
response in 24 patients (59%), CR in 14 patients (34%),
and tumor reduction in 93% of evaluable patients (41/44).
Of the 7 patients with B-symptoms at baseline, 6 had
symptom resolution. Again, serious side effects ≥grade 3
included PSN, anemia, and neutropenia, but also PMN,
hyperglycemia, diarrhea, vomiting, hypokalemia, and
-magnesemia. Overall, this study showed that SGN-35
might be more effective at a weekly dosing, but also had
increased adverse events, especially related to peripheral
neuropathy.[35]
Given its impressive activity, the use of SGN-35 is
currently being explored in several clinical trials in the
upfront setting combined with cytotoxic agents, as single
agent and in combination with other drugs for relapsed
refractory CD30+ malignancies, as well as maintenance
therapy post-induction chemotherapy or following SCT.
Preliminary results have been very promising, especially in
the upfront treatment of classical HL when combined with
doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (“A+AVD”),
where CR rates approached 95% in a Phase II trial (Ansell
SM et al. ASH 2012), and for frontline treatment for
patients with CD30+ mature T- and NK-cell lymphomas as
“A+CHP” (SGN-35 plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
prednisone) where an ORR of 100% and a CR rate of
401

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 397-412

88% was observed (Fanale MA et al. ASH 2012). Both
combinations are currently explored in ongoing phase
III clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01712490 and
NCT01777152).
Although a great addition to lymphoma therapy,
a potential caveat for the future widespread use of
SGN-35 might be the increased risk for pulmonary
toxicity, especially when used with other agents such as
bleomycin (Ansell SM et al. ASH 2012) or gemcitabine,
as well as the development of progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (PML), for which the FDA has
issued a black box warning.[36] An interesting observation
is that retreatment with SGN-35 might result in responses
even in patients who have previously progressed on
therapy with brentuximub vedotin (Bartlett N et al. ASCO
2010). This observation, though, will need confirmation in
a larger more systematically conducted clinical trial.

mAbs, with different numbers of toxic drugs attached to
each mAb.[40] For example, MCC-T-DM1 exists in a
heterogeneous form, ranging from 0-7 DM1 molecules
on each mAb, with a mean of 3.3 per mAb. The thio-TDM1 is constructed with a nonreducible bis-maleimido
trioxyethylene glycol (BMPEO) linker that attaches to
the engineered cysteines on the thio-mAb. This form
of T-DM1 has an average of 1.8 DM1 drugs per mAb,
with 90% of the population having 2 DM1 molecules per
mAb. In vitro studies proved the equivalent efficacy of
this newer ADC, while in vivo models showed that it was
more effective at reducing tumor burdens while having a
safer profile in rats and cynomolgous monkeys.[41]
Much preclinical research has been conducted on
T-DM1. It has proven to be effective in and ex vivo at
killing trastuzumab-resistant breast, and other epithelial
tumor cell lines. The dominant mechanism of cytotoxicity
appears to be through apoptosis and cell lysis, and not
cytostatic G2-M phase arrest as would be expected from
its drug class. Protease inhibitors blocked its activity,
implicating that T-DM1 is broken down in a lysosomal
dependent manner to an active catabolite, lysine-MCCDM1, which has anti-microtubule activity, but cannot
penetrate the cell membrane, thereby lessening the
bystander effect.[37] In vitro studies have also shown
that DM1 itself is far more potent than commonly used
cytotoxic agents in breast cancer such as paclitaxel or
doxorubicin, and that T-DM1 retains the same mechanisms
of action as trastuzumab alone: they both have equivalent
Her2 binding affinities, antibody-dependent cell-meditated
cytotoxicity (ADCC) activation, Akt inactivation, and
HER2 ectodomain shedding induction, implying that
T-DM1 may be able to replace Herceptin™ as a frontline
chemotherapy. T-DM1 was also effective against a variety
of trastuzumab and lapatinib resistant, and PI3K-pathway
activated, cell lines ex and in vivo.[42] Recently, it has
been discovered that T-DM1 can also cause cytotoxicity
through mitotic catastrophe.[43]
Numerous clinical trials exploring the use of T-DM1
in breast cancer as a single agent or in combination with
cytotoxic and Her2-directed therapy have been completed
by now. In a Phase I clinical trial in advanced HER2+
breast cancer patients (n=24), increasing doses (0.3-4.8
mg/kg) of T-DM1 were administered once every 3 weeks.
The OR rate was 25% without any CRs, while in the 15
patients who received the drug at the MTD of 3.6 mg/
kg, 73% had clinical benefit (OR and stable disease)
at 6 months. Serious side effects ≥ grade 3 included
thrombocytopenia and pulmonary hypertension. The most
common adverse events were thrombocytopenia, elevated
hepatic transaminases, fatigue, anemia, and nausea.
Fortunately, only 1of 22 patients evaluated developed antitherapeutic antibodies (ATA). The MCC linker was shown
to be quite stable as well: patients exhibited a 70-fold
difference in T-DM1 versus DM1 plasma concentrations.
[44]

her-2-neu

Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1; Kadcycla™) is the
most recently FDA approved ADC and indicated for the
treatment of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
2 (HER2) positive metastatic breast cancer. Based off
of the HER2 (EGFR2, neu) targeting mAb trastuzumab
(Herceptin™), T-DM1 consists of the antibody
trastuzumab conjugated to the anti-mitotic maytasanoid
N(2’)-deacetyl-N(2’)-(3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl)maytansine (DM1) via an N-[maleimidomethyl]
cyclohexane-1 carboxylate (MCC) linker. DM1 is a
powerful microtubule-depolymerizing agent with action
thought to be similar to that of the vinca alkaloid class of
chemotherapeutics. The linker is connected to DM1 via a
nonreducible thioether bond, while it connects to the mAb
at ε-lysine side chains. This novel linker was originally
seen to be superior to a number of disulfide bond based
linkers, as initial reports showed that the MCC linked
mAbs had a lower clearance rate, longer half-life, and
stronger anti-tumor effects along with reduced toxicity in
several in vivo (but not in vitro) models of Her2 positive
breast cancer.[37] However, recent research seems to
contradict this observation, as comparisons between
MCC and N-succinimydyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)-pentanoate
(SPP)-reducible disulfide based linkers have shown the
opposite: in vitro, MCC-T-DM1 had a stronger cytotoxic
effect compared to SPP-T-DM1, but this did not translate
to more potent tumor reduction in in vivo models of breast
cancer.[38] To further complicate this scenario, new
THIOMAB technologies have been developed that allow
for a more homogenous population of ADCs. THIOMABs
are antibodies that can be used as intermediates to produce
ADCs secondary to an engineered unpaired cysteine
residue on each heavy chain.[39]
Most ADCs are in fact a heterogeneous mixture of

Based on this data, a Phase II trial was initiated
treating 112 patients with HER2 positive metastatic
breast cancer (MBC) who had received prior Her2 based
therapy, with T-DM1. The ORR was 26%, with no CRs,
and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 4.6
months. Only 74 of the 95 enrolled patients had their
Her2 status retroactively confirmed via FISH (fluorescent
in-situ hybridization) or IHC (immunohistochemistry).
In these 74 patients the ORR was higher (34%) and the
median PFS was 8.2 months. Serious side effects ≥grade
3 included hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue.
The most common adverse events (AE) were fatigue,
nausea, headache, pyrexia, epistaxis, constipation, cough,
diarrhea, vomiting, hypokalemia, arthralgia, extremity
pain, anemia, and dyspnea. Interestingly, 31% of patients
developed ophthalmological AEs. Seven out of 108
evaluable patients tested positive for ATA.[45]
Another recently completed Phase II trial of single
agent T-DM1 enrolled 110 heavily pretreated patients.
The ORR was 35%, with no CRs, and a median PFS
of 6.9 months. Again, by FISH testing Her2 positive
status was confirmed for only 80 out of 95 patients. For
this subgroup, the ORR was 41% with a median PFS
of 7.3 months. Serious side effects ≥grade 3 included
thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and cellulitis, with 8% of
patients reporting serious hepatic toxicity. Again, the most
common AEs were fatigue, thrombocytopenia, nausea,
elevated AST, constipation, pyrexia, epistaxis, headache,
hypokalemia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, and anemia.
Six out of 108 patients developed ATA.[46] In an effort
to increase drug exposure, while preserving a similar
side effect profile, a weekly dosing schedule of T-DM1
was explored in a Phase I trial (n=28). The MTD was
determined to be 2.4 mg/kg, with an ORR of 46% and no
CRs. AEs were very similar to the other trials, while no
patients developed ATAs.[47]
In a retrospective analysis of the above mentioned
3 trials,[36-38] the effect of prior T-DM1 treatment on
subsequent treatment outcomes was explored. Clinical
outcomes of 15 patients who had received T-DM1 and
were now receiving other therapies were examined
to determine if T-DM1 could adversely affect followup treatment, especially when giving Herceptin™ or
Lapatinib. There did not appear to be any negative
consequences in receiving T-DM1, but the interpretation
is limited by the small sample size.[48] Additionally, to
better understand the mechanism behind T-DM1 induced
thrombocytopenia, the main DLT of the drug, a novel
high-content, quantitative, live-cell imaging technique was
used. The investigators demonstrated that T-DM1 is taken
up by megakaryocytes (MKs) via a non-EGFR-dependant
pathway (MKs are HER2-). The microtubule targeting
of DM1 in MK inhibits pro-platelet production and MK
differentiation, induces abnormal tubulin organization, and
suppresses microtubule dynamic instability.[49]
The results of the landmark phase III EMILIA trial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lead to the FDA approval of the drug for Her2-positive
MBC patients previously treated with a trastuzumab and a
taxane. In this trial, T-DM1 was compared to combination
therapy with lapatinib, an oral Her2 inhibitor, and
capecitabine in 991 patients with advanced HER2 positive
breast cancer who had previously been treated with
trastuzumab and a taxane. Treatment with T-DM1 resulted
in significantly improved ORR (43.6% versus 30.8%),
prolonged progression-free (median PFS 9.6 months
versus 6.4 months; Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.65; p<0.001),
and overall survival (median OS 30.9 months versus 25.1
months; HR= 0.68; p<0.001). Additionally, compared to
lapatinib plus capecitabine, patients experienced less grade
3 toxicities (41% versus 57%).[50] In the meantime many
clinical trials exploring the use of this promising agent in
the upfront metastatic and adjuvant setting alone and in
combination with other agents are currently undergoing.
A recently reported randomized Phase II clinical trial
compared T-DM1 to a combination of trastuzumab and
docetaxel (HT) as first-line therapy for patients with Her2positive MBC and appeared better tolerated and more
effective.[51] Given these results T-DM1 seems bound to
become the preferred treatment for Her2+ MBC.

Moxetumomab Pasudotox targets CD22-positive
lymphoid malignancies
Moxetumomab Pasudotox (HA22, CAT-8015) is
a second-generation recombinant Immunotoxin (RIT)
which targets CD22 and is derived of the same RFB4
monoclonal antibody used for Combotox. HA22 is a
high-CD22 affinity version of BL22 (CAT-3888), another
RIT. BL22 itself was based off of an ADC that combined
the antibody RFB4 linked to a Pseudomonas Exotoxin
(PE). PE exerts its cytotoxic effect on cells by ADPribosylating Elongation Factor 2 (EF2), a protein integral
for translation, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and
leading to cell death. To reduce non-specific toxicity,
the PE toxin was modified by removing its cell-binding
domain, leading to the development of PE38.[52] To
improve its pharmacokinetic profile, increase its potency,
and facilitate production, the IT was turned into an RIT.
The variable domain (Fv) portions of the mAb were
cloned, and a disulfide linkage was added between the
heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain to increase stability.
Then the VH domain was genetically fused to the PE38
toxin via the C3 (six amino-acid) connector. This process
eliminated the need for a linker. BL22 is highly cytotoxic
to CD22+ cell lines and prevents tumor growth in vivo
in a Burkitt Lymphoma mouse model.[53] Preclinical
mouse and primate models showed strong CD22-specific
and dose-dependent anti-tumor activity for an alternate
day treatment cycle for three doses, while also being well
tolerated.[54] Further in vitro studies with cells from 28
cancer patient samples showed that BL22 was cytotoxic
403

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 397-412

in around half of the patients’ samples. Cytotoxicity and
CD22 expression were positively correlated.[55]
The initial results from the first Phase I clinical trial
of BL22 in patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) were
very promising. Sixteen out of the 31 patients on the trial
had refractory HCL, and in this cohort of patients, 69%
had CRs with an ORR of 81%. Of the 11 CRs, only one
had signs of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in the bone
marrow. Unfortunately some serious side effects associated
with BL22 were observed, including Cytokine Release
Syndrome (CRS) and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
(HUS). To prevent CRS, patients were subsequently pretreated with daily Rofecoxib and Infliximab a week before
and after treatment. This strategy appeared to prevent
further cases of CRS. Less serious side effects included
hypoalbuminemia, elevated aminotransferase levels,
nausea, myalgia, edema, and elevated creatinine levels,
which were all reversible. Twenty-five percent of the
patients developed neutralizing antibodies to the IT.[56]
In the meanwhile, HA22 was developed from BL22 as
an RIT with a greater than 10 times affinity for CD22.
This higher affinity also resulted in greater cytotoxicity
toward CD22+ cell lines and enabled researchers to
examine its efficacy in hematological malignancies with
lower CD22 expression.[57] Further versions of CD22
with even greater affinity and cytotoxicity were developed,
although they so far have not been clinically pursued.[58,
59] Additional variants of HA22 have been tested that
have increased stability with reduced immunogenicity
and antigenicity, including HA22-8X,[60] HA22-LR,[61]
HA22-LR-8M,[62] and HA22-LR-L010.[63] Additionally,
the mechanisms of BL22 cytotoxicity were further
elucidated, with experiments showing that BL22 can
induce apoptosis via a caspase-3-like protease, in addition
to its ability to inhibit translation.[64] Further research
has shown that BL22 leads to PARP (Poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase) cleavage and both caspase-3 and caspase-9
activation in patient CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia)
samples.[65] The sensitivity of cells to apoptosis, which
is inversely proportional to Bcl2 expression, was seen as
a key determinant in the efficacy of BL22 on Mantle Cell
Lymphoma (MCL) cell lines, instead of being correlated
with CD22 expression. This suggests Bcl2 overexpression
as a possible method for cells to develop resistance against
BL22.[66]
The final results from the first BL22 Phase I clinical
trial in B-Cell malignancies were as encouraging as the
initial results for HCL patients. A total of 46 patients with
various B-cell malignancies (31 with HCL, 11 with CLL,
and 4 with other NHL) were enrolled. HCL patients had
a high CR rate of 61% and ORR of 80%, however, the
response was much more muted in the other patients, with
only 3 out of 11 CLL patients having a marginal response.
Although originally, prophylactic anti-inflammatory drugs
were used to prevent CRS, it soon became apparent that
HUS proved to be a more serious safety issue. In order
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to prevent HUS, prophylactic intravenous fluid was
administered to diminish renal toxicity. This measure,
along with reducing the dose of BL22, appeared to
ameliorate the issue. Otherwise, the safety profile was
similar to that of the initial Phase 1 study in HCL, with
35% of HCL, but no CLL or NHL patients developing
neutralizing antibodies.[67] In a Phase II trial testing
BL22 in 36 patients with refractory HCL, CRs were seen
in 47% of patients (with 18% having MRD), and an ORR
of 72%. Interestingly, smaller spleen size was highly
correlated with an improved response. Serious associated
toxicities included transaminitis, hypoalbuminemia,
fever, thrombocytopenia, VLS, proteinuria, anemia, and
hypoxia. All of these toxicities were reversible and did
not constitute a DLT or were associated with HUS. The
most common AEs were hypoalbuminemia, transaminitis,
edema, myalgia, proteinuria, fatigue, nausea, and fever.
Neutralizing antibodies were seen in 11% of patients.[68]
BL22 was less successful, however, in treating
pediatric pre-B ALL. In a Phase I clinical trial for pediatric
patients with refractory B-cell malignancies (n=23), 21
of whom had pre-B ALL, there were no CRs or PRs,
although there was transient clinical activity seen in 70%
of patients. Serious side effects at ≥grade 3 included
transaminitis and myelosuppression. The most common
toxicities were hypoalbuminemia, transaminitis, and
proteinuria. No cases of HUS or VLS were observed, and
no DLT was seen. Although neutralizing antibodies were
found in 13% of patients, the drug appeared to be much
better tolerated in children than adults.[69] To increase
efficacy, the use of Bryostatin I, a weak chemotherapeutic
agent that upregulates CD22 expression, was explored. In
in vitro CLL and MCL patient samples,[70] Bryostatin I
was administered before BL22 and resulted in increased
efficacy. Sequential administration of Bryostatin I
followed by BL22 may be a useful method to improve
results for the treatment of hematological malignancies
that have lower levels of CD22 expression. Another way
to increase efficacy of CD22-directed therapies may be
by using HA22, which has a much higher affinity for
CD22. HA22 has been tested in an in vivo mouse model
of primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL), where a single
dose injection of HA22 into the eye was enough to cause
complete tumor regression, with minimal associated eye
toxicity.[71] In pre-clinical studies, HA22 was significantly
more cytotoxic than BL22 toward CD22+ cell lines, and
more effective in reducing tumor volumes in a Burkitt
Lymphoma mouse model.[72] This improved efficacy
for HA22 compared with BL22 was also demonstrated
in cell cultures of pediatric pre-B ALL patient samples.
[73] A potential mechanism for HA22 resistance in ALL
patients has been described. In vitro studies on resistant
ALL cell lines revealed that a CpG island in the promoter
region of DPH4, which codes for the diphthamide
biosynthesis protein and is crucial for PE toxin mediation,
is hypermethylated, leading to downregulated levels of
404

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 397-412

the protein. This DPH4 downregulation is transient and
dependent on the presence of HA22, and can be overcome
by pretreatment with the methylation inhibitor azacytidine.
[74] More recently, a second mechanism for resistance has
been discovered in a resistant Burkitt NHL cell line, where
a mutation has led to the deletion of WDR85, another gene
that is necessary for dipthamide synthesis (Wei H et al.
ASH 2012).
In a Phase I clinical trial with 28 refractory HCL
patients, every other day HA22 treatment for 3 doses
led to CRs in 46% of patients, with an ORR of 86%.
Out of 9 patients who achieved a CR, only one was
positive for MRD. Like before, clinical success was
inversely proportional to spleen size, with patients
having a prior splenectomy suffering worse outcomes.
Serious side effects ≥grade 3 included lymphopenia,
γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) elevation, and leukopenia,
although none were considered serious enough to
be considered a DLT. The most common AEs were
hypoalbuminemia, transaminitis, limb/head and neck
edema, headache, hypotension, and nausea. Neutralizing
antibodies to the toxin were reported in 38% of patients.
[75] A recent update to this study involving 20 more
patients (n=42) confirms the above findings, with 55%
achieving a CR, and an ORR of 88%. Of the 21 CRs
evaluable for MRD, only 4 were positive (Kreitman RJ
et al. ASCO 2012). A phase I trial treating pediatric ALL
with HA22 at 6 doses every other day per 3-weekly cycle
is still ongoing, but preliminary results appear promising.
ORs were reported for 5 of 17 evaluable patients (29%),
with 4 (24%) achieving a CR. Hematological activity
(HA), as defined by a ≥50% reduction in blasts and/or
improvement in neutrophil and/or platelet counts, was
seen in 7 patients (41%). Serious VLS was reported in
two of the first seven patients, although this toxicity has
been ameliorated when dexamethasone was added as pretreatment. Anti-moxetumomab pasudotox neutralizing
antibodies were reported in 14% of patients (Wayne AS
et al. ASH 2011). HA22 is currently being evaluated in at
least 2 ongoing phase I clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT00586924 and NCT00659425).

usefulness and reduced toxicity when given in lower
doses during induction therapy, by increasing disease-free
survival specifically in older patients.[78, 79] The IgG4
G5/44 mAb was chosen, as it had the best combination
of high CD22 affinity combined with a high rate of
internalization. The mAb is joined to its toxin via the acid
hydrolysable 4-(4’-acteylphenoxy)butanoic acid (AcBut)
linker. This linker was proven to be more effective than
a more stable amide linker in both in vitro cytotoxicity
and in vivo anti-tumor assays.[80] The toxin is N-acetylγ-calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide (CalichDMH), which
is derived from the γ-calicheamicin antitumor antibiotic
naturally produced by the bacterium micromonospora
echinospora. This extremely potent product mediates
its cytotoxicity by binding DNA in its minor groove,
then undergoing thiol-dependent structural changes
in its enediyne moiety to generate a di-radical, which
abstracts hydrogens from the phosphodiester backbone
of DNA, leading to double stranded breaks in the
DNA, and ultimately cell death. There is an average of
5-7 moles of toxin per mole of mAb. CMC-544 is seen
as more of a targeted chemotherapy as opposed to an
immunotherapy, due to the weakness of its mAb, which
has nearly no efficacy on its own, owing to its inability
to fix complement or initiate ADCC. However, CMC-544
was even more cytotoxic against CD22+ B-lymphoma
cell lines than unconjugated CalichDMH, and had strong
dose-dependent anti-tumor activity against small and large
B-cell lymphoma (BCL) xenografts.[81]
Further studies showed that CMC-544 was also
active in both early and late stage disseminated BCL
murine models, while Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20
mAb, was only effective, and to a lesser degree, at the
early stage.[82] Preclinical research showed that CMC544 could have an additive or synergistic effect when
combined with Rituximab. This could be due to their
different modes of action, as Rituximab relies on ADCC/
fixing complement for its anti-tumor activity, which
CMC-544 is unable to perform. Importantly, CMC-544
caused significant tumor regression in a Rituximabrefractory established tumor model.[83] CMC-544
was also found to have strong cytotoxicity against
ALL cell lines, along with potent dose dependent antitumor activity in both subcutaneous xenograft and
disseminated ALL murine models.[84] Finally, CMC-544
demonstrated greater efficacy than either of the frontline
combination NHL therapies, CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) or CVP (CHOP
without doxorubicin) in both in vitro and in vivo assays.
Importantly, CMC-544 retained activity in CHOP/CVPrefractory tumor models, while also showing increased
potency when given in combination with CVP (but not
CHOP, which was too toxic).[85]
Further in vitro studies showed that CMC-544
efficacy was inversely correlated with P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression, an efflux pump responsible for multi-drug

Inotuzumab Ozogamicin is showing promise in
treating CD22+ ALL and NHL
Inotuzumab Ozogamicin (INO; CMC-544) is
another anti-CD22 directed ADC. Its antibody is based off
of the humanized IgG4 G5/44 mAb (not RFB4). CMC544 is a close relative of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO;
Mylotarg™), an anti-CD33 mAb with the same linker
and toxin as CMC-544. GO was the first ADC approved
by the FDA for the treatment of AML,[76] but was later
voluntarily withdrawn from the US market because of
concern about its toxicity (mainly sinusoidal obstruction
syndrome).[77] Of note, recent findings support GO’s

resistance (MDR) in CLL and NHL cell lines, as well as
in patient samples. However, this could be overcome by
combining CMC-544 with the MDR modifiers PSC833
or MS209.[86] Additionally, it was discovered that CD22
and CD55 expression decreased after CMC-544 treatment
in both BCL cell lines and patient samples, while CD20
and CD59 levels remained the same. This correlated
with an increased efficacy in the complement dependent
cytotoxicity (CDC) of Rituximab that was seen only when
given after CMC-544 treatment, and not when given
simultaneously.[87] Research with pre-B ALL patient
samples showed that the large variation in sensitivity to
CMC-544 was directly correlated with sensitivity of the
cells to free calicheamicin and how quickly CMC-544
could be internalized into the cells, but was not dependent
on extracellular CD22 levels or the ability of the cells to
renew their CD22 expression.[88]	
The first Phase I trial of CMC-544 involved 79
patients with refractory NHL, with the majority (35 each)
having either follicular lymphoma (FL) or diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The MTD was established
at 1.8 mg/m2 given once every 3-4 weeks, with the DLT
being thrombocytopenia. While the ORR was only 39%,
the ORR at MTD for FL was 68%, with 32% CRs and a
median PFS of 317 days, while for DLBCL it was a lower
15%, with 7.7% CRs and a median PFS of 49 days. Serious
side effects at ≥grade 3 included thrombocytopenia,
neutropenia, leukopenia, asthenia, arthralgia, and
fever. The most common AEs were thrombocytopenia,
asthenia, nausea, neutropenia, fever, elevated AST levels,
abdominal pain, and anorexia. While thrombocytopenia
was a major issue, without a known obvious mechanism
for its occurrence, there were no major hemorrhages
reported.[89] Another smaller Phase I trial, involving 13
Japanese patients with refractory FL who had previously
been treated with Rituximab, had similar findings. The
ORR was 85%, with 54% CRs. Serious side effects ≥grade
3 included thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia,
leukopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypokalemia. The
most common AEs were thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,
neutropenia, elevated AST levels, anorexia, and nausea.
[90]
A more recent Phase I trial, also done in Japan,
which combined CMC-544 treatment one day following
Rituximab every 4 weeks in 10 refractory NHL patients
(6 of whom had FL) also showed promising results.
The ORR was 80%, with 70% CRs, while the CR rate
in FL patients was 83%. Serious side effects ≥grade 3
included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia,
leucopenia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated AST levels.
The most common AEs were thrombocytopenia, elevated
transaminase levels, leukopenia, nausea, neutropenia,
and lymphopenia. Importantly, Rituximab did not induce
any major changes in the pharmacokinetic or safety
profile of CMC-544 than when CMC-544 was used as a
monotherapy.[91] Most recently, Fayad and colleagues
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reported a combined dose-escalation Phase I /II trial of
R-INO (rituximab and INO) in patients with relapsed FL
and DLBCL, and refractory aggressive NHL (n=118). At
the MTD (Rituximab 375mg/m2 on day 1, INO 1.8mg/
m2 on day 2, given every 4 weeks for up to 8 cycles),
the ORR was 87%, 74%, and 20% respectively for FL
(n=39), DLBCL (n=42) and refractory NHL (n=30), with
a 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 68%, and
42% for FL and DLBCL, respectfully. Thirty percent of
patients treated experienced serious AEs, which included
pneumonia, sepsis, thrombocytopenia, nausea and/
or vomiting, peripheral edema, chest pain, dizziness,
infection and nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Treatment
at MTD was discontinued in 43% secondary to toxicities,
most commonly secondary to thrombocytopenia or
hyperbilirubinemia.[92]
The addition of INO to chemotherapy has also been
explored in another Japanese Phase 1 study (Ogura M et al.
ASH 2011), with the expansion cohort at the MTD having
been recently updated. Ogura and colleagues identified the
MTD as full dose R-CVP combined with INO at 0.8mg/
m2 given on day 2 of a 3-weekly cycle. In the expansion
cohort, 32 patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL
[FL (n = 15), MCL (n = 1), and DLBCL (n = 16)] were
treated at MTD. The ORR was 100% (53% CR) and 605
(7% CR) for patients with FL and DLBCL respectively.
The most commonly described AE of any grade were
thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, fatigue,
constipation, and nausea; the most common grade ≥3
AEs included cytopenias and transaminitis with 1 death
secondary to pneumonia in a neutropenic patient (Ogura
M et al. ASH 2012).
Another trial looked at Rituximab plus INO (R-INO)
salvage therapy followed by autologous SCT (ASCT) for
61 patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Common
adverse events during R-INO treatment were again
cytopenias, transaminitis, fatigue, pyrexia, and vomiting
(24%). Two patients had veno-occlusive disease of the
liver (VOD) after ASCT. Fifty-four evaluable patients
received a median of 3 cycles of R-INO. The ORR after
R-INO was 35% (24% CR, 11% PR), 13% had SD, and
50% progressive lymphoma. Prior response to the most
recent therapy was predictive of response to R-INO. Stem
cell mobilization and stem cell collection after R-INO
appeared acceptable. Six- and 12-month PFS rates for all
treated patients were 31% and 13%, respectively (median
PFS 2.6 months), and the median OS was 10 months. For
patients who underwent ASCT, the 6- and 12-month PFS
rates were 79% and 35%, respectively (median PFS 10
months) and the median OS was not reached (WagnerJohnson N et al. ASH 2011). Multiple other trials with INO
in NHL, in combination with Rituximab or chemotherapy,
in the upfront and relapsed setting, are planned or ongoing.
In addition to the treatment of NHL, INO shows
promise also for ALL. A Phase II trial involving 49
adult and pediatric patients with refractory ALL showed
406

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 397-412

encouraging results. Eighteen percent of patients achieved
a CR, and 39% had a marrow CR (<5% lymphoblasts),
resulting in an ORR of 57%. The median OS was 5.1
months for all patients, and 7.9 months for responders.
Serious side effects ≥grade 3 included thrombocytopenia,
neutropenia, fever, and hyperbilirubinemia, which was
reversible in most cases. The most common adverse events
were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, elevated ALT/AST
levels, fever, hypotension, and hyperbilirubinemia.[93]
Two trials explored a weekly schedule of INO for patients
with relapsed refractory B-cell ALL (DeAngelo D et al.
ASH 2012; Jabbour E et al. ASCO 2012). Responses
were consistent in both trials and observed across all
INO doses. The ORR ranged around 82% with a CR and
CRi (incomplete CR) rate ranging between 45-50%. At
the same time the toxicities appeared similar in nature
(hematological, liver and gastrointestinal), but possibly
less severe and/or frequent.
Given these encouraging early results in both
B-cell NHL and ALL, INO is currently being tested in
multiple Phase I, II, and III trials alone, in combination
with Rituximab, and with other chemotherapeutic
regimens (e.g. GemOx [gemcitabine and oxaliplatin],
GDP [gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin],
temsirolimus, and CVP).

that might enable clinicians to safely extend the lifespan
of patients with various cancer diagnoses.

CONCLUSIONS
The five types of ADCs described here in detail
illustrate some of the many different strategies research
groups are taking to bring ADCs from bench to bedside
(Table 2). The two most recently FDA approved ADCs,
Brentuximab vedotin and Trastuzumab emtansine, were
welcome by clinicians with great anticipation. These
ADCs were developed using novel peptide and thioether
linkers, respectively, giving them an advantage over older
ADCs using linkers with less stability, and therefore
causing more collateral damage secondary to systemic offtarget effects by free toxin. Following the biotechnological
progress in ADC development there has to be a similar
progress in finding the best dosing strategies and
combination with other drugs to maximize their efficacy.
The inherent specificity of ADCs may serve as the
perfect complement to the broad based killing effects of
standard cytotoxic chemotherapies, as ADCs are able to
destroy slower growing and even quiescent cancer cells
that are more resistant to chemotherapy and most likely
responsible for relapse and refractoriness. Determining the
optimal dosing schedule as part of combination therapy
might help increase efficacy, while reducing the side
effects of both the ADC and chemotherapy. Certain classes
of chemotherapies may also work in a synergistic manner
with specific ADC toxins and drugs that increase antigen
expression might counter resistance to targeted agents.
Addition of ADCs to the armamentarium of oncologists
has offered novel and more targeted treatment strategies
