ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of death among women with
gynecologic cancer. We examined molecular profiles of fibroblasts from normal ovary
and high-grade serous ovarian tumors to identify novel therapeutic targets involved
in tumor progression. We identified 2,300 genes that are significantly differentially
expressed in tumor-associated fibroblasts. Fibroblast expression of one of these genes,
connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.
CTGF protein expression in ovarian tumor fibroblasts significantly correlated with gene
expression levels. CTGF is a secreted component of the tumor microenvironment and
is being pursued as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer. We examined its effect
in in vitro and ex vivo ovarian cancer models, and examined associations between
CTGF expression and clinico-pathologic characteristics in patients. CTGF promotes
migration and peritoneal adhesion of ovarian cancer cells. These effects are abrogated
by FG-3019, a human monoclonal antibody against CTGF, currently under clinical
investigation as a therapeutic agent. Immunohistochemical analyses of high-grade
serous ovarian tumors reveal that the highest level of tumor stromal CTGF expression
was correlated with the poorest prognosis. Our findings identify CTGF as a promoter of
peritoneal adhesion, likely to mediate metastasis, and a potential therapeutic target
in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. These results warrant further studies into the
therapeutic efficacy of FG-3019 in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION

10 normal ovary samples and 51 HGSOC tumors.
Furthermore, we examine the functional role of connective
tissue growth factor (CTGF) in in vitro and ex vivo models
of HGSOC. CTGF is a secreted stromal factor that is well
established in driving extracellular matrix formation as
well as proliferation, cell migration, angiogenesis and
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, and which has
been previously identified as over-expressed in a number
of other cancer types [17–20]. We show that CTGF
promotes migration and peritoneal adhesion of HGSOC
cells, and inhibition of CTGF by a therapeutic antibody
FG-3019 abrogates these effects. Our results establish
that otherwise normal fibroblasts undergo genome-wide
expression changes in response to the epithelial ovarian
tumor, and identify CTGF as a new potential therapeutic
target in HGSOC.

Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of death
among women with gynecologic cancer, responsible for
5% of cancer-related deaths [1]. The high mortality rate
results from the lack of an adequate screening test for
early disease, coupled with rapid progression to chemoresistance. Although patients diagnosed with early stage
disease have a 5-year survival rate of 80%, the majority
of women are diagnosed at late stage, when the disease
has already metastasized to multiple organs within the
peritoneal cavity, resulting in a reduced 5-year survival
rate of < 30% [2].
Recent molecular investigations, such as those
performed by The Cancer Genome Atlas [3], have led
to an increased understanding of the pathogenesis of
ovarian cancer. Epithelial ovarian tumors are generally
classified as serous, endometrioid, clear cell or mucinous
histotypes. Serous ovarian tumors are most common, and
are classified as low-grade (Type I) or high-grade (Type
II) tumors [4, 5]. High grade serous ovarian cancers
(HGSOC) are thought to be de novo invasive and are
genomically unstable [4, 6], contributing to the eventual
development of chemo-resistant disease in 75% of treated
women [7]. As a consequence, the stromal components
of the tumor, which are relatively genomically stable and
essential for progression and metastasis [8], have been
increasingly targeted by newly developed anti-cancer
therapies [9].
Previously, studies have sought to characterize
over-expression of specific ovarian tumor stromal
genes in a compartmentalized fashion. These studies
have demonstrated that genes such as osteonectin [10],
keratinocyte growth factor [11], transforming growth
factor alpha [12] and beta [13], hepatocyte growth factor
[14] and kit ligand [11] are differentially expressed
between normal ovary and ovarian tumor stroma. More
recent studies have undertaken analyses of stromal gene
expression using molecular profiling studies of laser
capture microdissected stroma from HGSOC tumors [15,
16]; however, samples sizes in these studies were limited.
In this study, we perform a comprehensive
molecular profiling analysis of stromal fibroblasts in

RESULTS
Ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts display
different gene expression profiles compared to
normal ovarian fibroblasts
We examined global molecular profiles for 51
ovarian tumor-associated fibroblast and 10 normal ovarian
fibroblast samples. Expression of the T-cell markers
CD8 and CD45 and the endothelial cell markers TIE-2
and VEGFR1 were below the level of detection in most
samples, indicating that the samples were enriched for
fibroblasts and not contaminated by immune or endothelial
components of the stroma (Supplementary Figure S1A).
Thus, fibroblasts were the major contributing component
of the gene expression profiles.
Hierarchical clustering displayed two distinct
branches, clearly distinguishing between normal and
tumor-associated fibroblasts (Figure 1). Supervised
class comparison analysis identified 2,703 probe
sets, corresponding to 2,300 genes, as significantly
differentially expressed between tumor-associated and
normal fibroblasts (Supplementary Table S2). There
was substantial overlap between our list of differentially
expressed genes and those derived from 2 recent molecular

profile studies of laser capture microdissected stroma from
HGSOC tumors [15, 16] (Supplementary Table S3).

[15, 16] showed significantly increased CTGF expression
in HGSOC stroma, compared with matched HGSOC
epithelial cells (Figure 2E). These findings indicate that
CTGF expression is primarily restricted to tumor-associated
fibroblasts in HGSOC.

Quantitative real-time PCR validation of
microarray data
Nine genes differentially expressed between normal
and tumor-associated fibroblasts were selected to validate
the microarray results in all samples by qRT-PCR. Of
the 9 genes tested, 8 (THBS1, CYR61, CTGF, MXRA5,
SPP1, LTBP2, TGFBR1 and COL11A1) were found
by qRT-PCR to be significantly differentially expressed
in tumor-associated fibroblasts, for a validation rate of
89%. The trends in gene expression levels across normal
and tumor samples were consistent between qRT-PCR
and microarray analysis, with genes identified as overexpressed by microarray also found to be over-expressed
by PCR (Supplementary Figure S1B).

CTGF promotes migration, anchorageindependent growth and peritoneal adhesion of
HGSOC cell lines
We sought to determine the effect of exogenous
CTGF, and its inhibition, on tumor-promoting processes.
Migration of A224, OVCAR3 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer
cells lines through transwells was significantly increased
upon addition of recombinant human CTGF (rhCTGF),
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). Addition of
5 μg/ml rhCTGF significantly stimulated migration of
A224 (p-value < 0.008), OVCAR3 (p-value < 0.02) and
SKOV3 (p-value < 0.02), while addition of 100 μg/ml
CTGF-blocking antibody FG-3019 significantly decreased
transwell migration in the presence of rhCTGF in A224
(p-value < 0.004), OVCAR3 (p-value < 0.003) and
SKOV3 (p-value < 0.02) (Figure 3B).
Anchorage-dependent (plastic) and anchorageindependent (soft agar) cell proliferation was measured
in A224, OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells. Addition of 5 μg/
ml rhCTGF in anchorage-dependent cell proliferation
assays did not promote proliferation over a 4-day period
(Supplementary Figure S2A). For measurement of
anchorage-independent growth, we established CTGFover-expressing clones from OVCAR3 cells to stably
express and secrete CTGF. Because of the long incubation
times required for soft agar assays, this approach was
necessary to overcome the instability of rhCTGF in
culture media. All three CTGF-over-expressing clones
demonstrated significantly increased anchorageindependent growth compared to empty vector controls
(p < 0.0001) (Supplementary Figure S2B). These findings
are consistent with previous studies, which demonstrated
that CTGF expression enhanced anchorage-independent
growth in the MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell line,
while having no effect on monolayer growth [29].
Peritoneal metastasis is common in ovarian
cancer and represents a major challenge in treatment.
During tumor progression, HGSOC cells from the ovary
disseminate throughout the peritoneal cavity and adhere
to the peritoneal wall [31, 32]. CTGF expression has been
examined in human peritoneal tissue, and shown to be
present in both the mesothelial cells and the peritoneal
fibroblasts [33]. IHC on mouse peritoneal tissue similarly
reveals CTGF expression within the mesothelial
layer, and fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure S3). To
determine whether CTGF mediates peritoneal adhesion,
we developed an ex vivo peritoneal adhesion assay and
measured adhesion of cells to mouse peritoneal tissue.
Addition of 5 μg/ml rhCTGF significantly increased

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is overexpressed specifically in fibroblasts of HGSOC
tumors
One of the genes identified as consistently upregulated in HGSOC tumor-associated versus normal
fibroblasts is Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF).
CTGF is a TGF-beta-regulated, secreted component
of tumor stroma, and is well established in driving
extracellular matrix formation, cell migration, angiogenesis
and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation [21,
22]. In several cancer types, including esophageal [23],
breast [24] and prostate [25], CTGF has been shown to
promote tumorigenesis. Notably, CTGF is currently under
clinical investigation as a viable therapeutic target in
pancreatic cancer and fibrotic diseases by FibroGen Inc.
(San Francisco, CA, USA). FibroGen has developed a
monoclonal anti-CTGF blocking antibody FG-3019,
which inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in pancreatic
cancer in preclinical studies [26–28], and has been shown
to be safe and well-tolerated [29]. Thus, we pursued CTGF
as a therapeutic target that could be readily translated to
the clinic.
To validate CTGF expression in HGSOC tumors,
immunohistochemical staining of CTGF was performed on
paraffin-embedded sections from 17 HGSOC tumors and
10 normal ovarian tissues that were profiled in this study.
CTGF protein expression was undetectable in the cortical
stroma and surface epithelium of normal ovary (Figure
2A), while CTGF expression in HGSOC tumor stroma was
significantly higher than in normal ovaries (p-value = 0.024)
(Figure 2B). IgG staining was not detected in the tissue
sections (Figure 2C). Furthermore, there was a positive
correlation between CTGF gene expression in fibroblasts
and IHC-derived protein expression in the stroma (r =
0.636) (Figure 2D). Our [30] and other gene expression data

on peritoneal adhesion (data not shown).

adhesion of OVCAR3 (p-value < 0.002) and SKOV3
(p-value < 0.001) cells to peritoneal tissue (Figure 3C
and 3D, respectively). Addition of 50 μg/ml FG-3019
significantly inhibited rhCTGF-mediated peritoneal
adhesion in OVCAR3 (p-value < 6 × 10-5) and SKOV3
(p-value < 0.0003) (Figure 3C and 3D, respectively).
Interestingly, adhesion in the rhCTGF+FG-3019-treated
cells was significantly decreased compared to untreated
cells (p-value < 0.006 for OVCAR3, p-value < 0.002 for
SKOV3), suggesting that FG-3019 may be acting upon
endogenous CTGF expressed in the peritoneal tissue.
CTGF has been shown to bind to the fibronectin
receptor integrin α5β1 and promote migration in pancreatic
cells [34], and integrin α5β1 has been demonstrated
to mediate peritoneal adhesion of ovarian cancer cells
[35]. To investigate whether CTGF mediates its effect
on HGSOC cells via α5β1, we examined the effect of
blocking the activity of integrin α5β1 on peritoneal
adhesion of OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells (Figure 3E).
rhCTGF-stimulated peritoneal adhesion was significantly
hindered upon treatment with anti-integrin α5β1 antibody
compared to rhCTGF-treated cells (p-value < 0.008 for

Association between CTGF expression and
clinico-pathologic characteristics
Our studies indicate that CTGF may serve as a
novel therapeutic target in HGSOC by promoting steps
within the metastatic process (motility and adhesion),
which are inhibited by treatment with FG-3019. We
wished to further characterize CTGF as a prognostic
factor in an independent cohort of HGSOC cases, and
to identify those patients who may be more likely to
respond to treatment with FG-3019. We performed a
retrospective study to examine CTGF expression in 93
HGSOC primary tumors and 10 normal ovarian tissue
controls, and correlated staining with clinico-pathologic
characteristics including overall survival (Figure 4,
Table  1). CTGF staining was significantly higher in
HGSOC samples compared to normal controls (p-value =
0.013). CTGF expression was not significantly associated

with stage or grade of disease. Increasing percentage of
stromal cells expressing CTGF was directly correlated
with poorer overall survival (Supplementary Figure S4).
The greatest separation in survival was between patients
with ≤ 90% of cells versus those with > 90% of cells
expressing CTGF (p-value = 0.006). These patients did
not differ from the rest of the cohort with respect to age,
stage/grade or debulking/cytoreduction status. However,
the number of cases in this category was limited (N = 4),
and additional studies with larger sample sizes will be
necessary to verify this association. In agreement with this
trend of increasing CTGF protein expression associated
with decreased survival, we identified a similar association
between CTGF gene expression and survival in the TCGA
dataset [3], with those cases expressing highest levels of
CTGF (z-score > 2, N = 15) having the poorest survival
(Supplementary Figure S5).

and action in ovarian cancer have reported conflicting
findings. Gery et al. first demonstrated that CTGF is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian tumors, and that expression
correlates with stage of disease [37], similar to our studies
showing that highest stromal CTGF expression in a
subset of HGSOC was associated with a poor outcome.
Tothill et al. described a molecular signature in a subset
of HGSOC samples that was primarily driven by a high
stromal response [15]. Similar to our findings, the gene
expression data from this study demonstrated that CTGF
was over-expressed in the stroma of these tumors, and
expression was also associated with a poor outcome,
suggesting that CTGF expression may promote aggressive
disease [15]. However, a recent immunohistochemical
analysis of CTGF expression in 107 invasive ovarian
carcinomas found that loss of CTGF was associated with a
poor prognosis [38], although it is unclear whether stromal
expression was examined. While functional and genomic
studies clearly indicate CTGF as a novel therapeutic target,
it remains to be determined whether CTGF expression
alone is prognostic. Additional investigations in stratified
studies are necessary to identify the subset(s) of patients
in which CTGF expression may be used as a prognostic
biomarker.
Our studies and others suggest that CTGF
inhibition by FG-3019 may have beneficial effects, as
tumors with increased stromal involvement present with

DISCUSSION
Tumor stroma plays a crucial role in promoting
transformation and progression of cancer cells, making
stromal factors attractive targets for chemo-prevention and
chemotherapy intervention, and studies are investigating
this novel approach (reviewed in [36]). While numerous
studies have investigated CTGF as a stromal target in
various diseases, to date these studies of CTGF expression

poorer survival. Our studies demonstrate that FG-3019
treatment decreases CTGF-induced HGSOC migration
and peritoneal adhesion in vitro. Additional studies have
indicated that targeting CTGF may be most beneficial in
desmoplastic, chemotherapy-resistant tumors, which are
difficult to model in ovarian cancer with existing systems.
Neesse et al. [28] investigated whether inhibition of
the tumor stromal compartment in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma could improve survival in vivo. Inhibition
of CTGF by FG-3019 treatment in mice carrying
gemcitabine-resistant tumors resulted in increased tumor
apoptosis, response and survival [28]. Future studies
would address this hypothesis by examining the effect
of CTGF inhibition on cisplatin-resistant tumor growth
and survival; we are currently preparing for studies to
investigate FG-3019 efficacy in cisplatin-resistant HGSOC
patient-derived xenografts.
CTGF expression and effect are likely to be
context-dependent, and different cell/tumor types
respond differently to CTGF. For examples, studies
have reported that CTGF expression is down-regulated
in in vitro 3D models of epithelial ovarian cancer [39,
40], while another report described increased CTGF
expression in ovarian cancer cell lines capable of
spheroid formation [41]. A study using epithelial cell
lines derived from endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous
histotypes of ovarian cancer, all molecularly and
clinically distinct from HGSOC, showed methylationdriven inactivation of CTGF. Over-expression of CTGF
in these cell lines subsequently resulted in decreased
growth [42]. It is likely then that CTGF expression and
cellular effects are dependent on, or influenced by, the
tumor microenvironment.
A recent study by Zhang et al. undertook an
integrative genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic
analysis in ovarian cancer to further elucidate the
poor prognosis for ovarian cancer patients [43].
They identified several functions related to tumor
progression that were enriched in subtypes with the
poorest prognosis, including cell adhesion, growth
factor binding, motility and angiogenesis. Notably, these
functions include CTGF as an up-regulated gene in this
poor prognosis subtype. Similarly, our results suggest
that CTGF may promote the metastatic potential of
HGSOC by increasing cellular motility and adhesion
of tumor epithelial cells to peritoneal tissue, revealing
CTGF as a new potential target and uncovering a novel
therapeutic approach in HGSOC.

hospitalized at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital
between 1990 and 2000. Classification was determined
according to the International Federation of Gynecology
and Obstetrics standards. Normal ovaries were obtained
from patients who had undergone surgery for benign
gynecologic diseases. The Garvan Institute of Medical
Research Tissue Microarrays were constructed from
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens
from women undergoing primary laparatomy at the
Gynaecological Cancer Centre, Royal Hospital for
Women, Sydney, between 1989 and 2002. Surgical,
clinical and histopathologic data (histopathologic
diagnosis, FIGO stage, surgical debulking, tumor grade,
survival) were extracted from medical records. All
specimens and their corresponding clinical information
were collected by written consent under protocols
approved by the institutional review boards of the
respective institutions.

Microdissection and RNA isolation, amplification
and hybridization
Microdissection and RNA isolation were performed
as previously described [44]. Briefly, fibroblasts were
identified by a pathologist and microdissected from 7 μm
frozen sections of ovarian tumors or normal ovary using
a MD LMD laser microdissecting microscope (Leica,
Wetzlar, Germany). RNA was isolated immediately in
RLT lysis buffer and was extracted and purified using the
RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). All purified
total RNA specimens were quantified and checked for
quality with a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent, Palo
Alto, CA). Total RNA amplification and hybridization
were performed as previously described [44]. (GEO
accession number GSE40595).

Data normalization, filtering and analysis
Global normalization, quality control screening and
collation were performed as previously described [44].
Normalized data were uploaded into the NCI Microarray
Analysis Database for quality-control screening and
collation. BRB ArrayTools (version 3.5.0) software
developed by Dr. Richard Simon and Amy Peng Lam
(National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) was used to
filter the array data, selecting only those probe sets that
were present in > 50% of the arrays and whose expression
was varied among the top 50th percentile, and complete
the statistical analysis. The filtered data set (9,741
probe sets) was used for hierarchical clustering, using
a Euclidean distance metric with average linkage, and
class comparison analysis between tumor-associated and
normal fibroblasts. The resulting gene list (2,703 probe
sets) contained < 10 false positives at a confidence of
95%. Differential expression was considered significant
at p-value < 0.001.

Quantitative real-time PCR

Cell migration assays

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed
on 100 ng of double-amplified product from all specimens
using primer sets specific for 9 genes (selected either at
random or as a gene of interest), as well as 2 normalizing
genes, beta-glucuronidase (GUSB) and cyclophilin
(Supplementary Table S1). An iCycler iQ Real-time PCR
Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA)
was used in conjunction with the SuperScript III Platinum
SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell motility was determined using 8 micron PET
membrane transwell culture chambers (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA). Cells were serum-starved overnight. RPMI
media/10% serum (500 μl) was added to lower wells and
cells were seeded in 350 μl serum-free RPMI media in
the upper wells. Recombinant CTGF (5 μg/ml), FG-3019
(100 μg/ml) and/or IgG (100 μg/ml) were added to the
top and bottom wells, and the chambers were incubated
at 37°C for 6 hours. The non-motile cells were removed
from the upper surface of the membrane with a cottontipped swab. The membranes were then fixed and stained
using Diff-Quik stain (Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL). Three
independent experiments were performed with triplicate
samples. The number of migrating cells was calculated
by counting the total number of cells in 5 fields at 20X
magnification.

Immunohistochemistry of tissue sections
Immunolocalization of CTGF protein was performed
on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections using
a commercially available anti-CTGF polyclonal antibody
(ab6992, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and the Picture MAX
system (Zymed Laboratories Inc, Carlsbad, CA). Samples
were de-paraffinized by incubating in xylene, rehydrated
by soaking in 95% ethanol, followed by antigen retrieval in
Target Retrieval Solution (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) at 120°C
for 20 minutes. Slides were treated for endogenous peroxidase
activity in 3% hydrogen peroxide and sections were incubated
with primary antibody (1:50 dilution) at room temperature for
60 minutes, washed twice with 1x TBS and incubated with
HRP polymer for 30 minutes. CTGF-positive signals were
visualized using ACE Single Solution (Zymed Laboratories
Inc, Carlsbad, CA). As negative control, normal rabbit IgG
was applied to the HGSOC with high-levels of stromal CTGF
expression. Stromal CTGF protein expression was quantified in
one or two sections per case using Image-Pro Plus 5.1.0.20 for
Windows (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD), as previously
described [45]. The staining saturation was measured from 5
fixed-size areas in the stroma of both tumor and normal ovaries
and averaged, yielding one score for each case.

Ex vivo peritoneal assays
Ovarian cancer cell peritoneal adhesion was
determined using an ex vivo assay, modified from
previous studies [46]. Briefly, the peritoneal tissue was
excised from euthanized 10–12 weeks-old female Balb/c
mice, divided along the midline into two pieces and
placed into serum-free media. In 96-well plates, 100 μL
of medium containing 5 × 104 Syto9-labeled cells was
added to 100 μL of medium containing rhCTGF (final
concentration 5 μg/mL), FG-3019 (final concentration
50 μg/mL), or IgG (final concentration 50 μg/mL).
Anti-integrin α5β1 antibody (MAB1969, clone JBS5,
Chemicon) was used at a final concentration of 20
μg/ml. Peritoneal tissue (mesothelial surface facing
downward) was laid over the wells and was covered by a
glass coverslip and the plate lid. The plate was incubated
upside-down for 2 hours at 37ºC. The peritoneal tissue
was then washed with serum-free medium, and attached
cells observed and imaged using a Leica MZ16FA
fluorescent dissection microscope, attached to a Leica
DFC420C camera. Image J was used to count 3 fields
per well.

Tissue culture
A224, OVCAR3 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines
were cultured in RPMI medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 mM L-glutamine
and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37º and 5% CO2.
Cell lines were authenticated by STR analysis.

Immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays
Garvan Institute tissue microarrays were
constructed as previously described [47]. Tissue
microarray sections were de-paraffinized by incubation
in xylene, followed by antigen retrieval using DAKO
pH9 solution (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) for 4 minutes.
Endogenous activity was then blocked with 3% H202.
Tissue microarrays were incubated with anti-CTGF
antibody FG-3145 (FibroGen Inc., San Francisco, CA)
at 30 μg/mL for 60 minutes. The Novocastra Novolink
Polymer Detection System (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo

Materials
Recombinant human CTGF (rhCTGF), purified
from a stable CTGF over-expressing CHO cell line, FG3145 and FG-3019 were provided by FibroGen, Inc. (San
Francisco, CA). FG-3019 is a fully human IgG1 mAb
recognizing domain 2 of human and rodent CTGF. FG3145 is a mouse mAb against human CTGF, used for
immunohistochemistry studies. Normal mouse IgG (Santa
Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) was used as a control.

For gene expression by quantitative real-time
PCR, relative expression was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT
method, using CT values for two housekeeping genes as
a single reference. The Mann-Whitney U Test was used
to compare medians of continuous variables between
two independent samples in the immunohistochemistry
study. R values indicate Pearson’s correlation
coefficients. For the in vitro studies, comparisons
were made using two-tailed Student’s t-test with the
assumption of unequal variance and an alpha of 0.05.
For analysis of clinic-pathologic associations, median
survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method
and the difference was tested using the Log-Rank
Test. The 5-year survival rate was estimated using the
life-table method. P-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
