Abstract
Therapeutic inhibitors are being developed against the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, the deregulation of which drives tumor growth and survival in many cancers. There are eight PI3Ks in mammals
divided into three classes. Class IA PI3Ks (p110α, p110β, and p110δ) are critical for cell growth and survival,
with the p110α isoform implicated as the most important in carcinomas. In this study, we examined the effects of small-molecule inhibitors of class IA PI3Ks to explore the contributions of different isoforms in cancer
cells. Similar responses were seen in cancer cells with wild-type or activated mutant PI3K genes treated with
p110α/δ or p110α/β/δ inhibitors in cell viability assays. In contrast, PTEN-negative cell lines tended to be less
responsive (4-fold overall) to an inhibitor of p110α/δ versus p110α/β/δ. Combining a p110α/δ inhibitor with a
p110β inhibitor resulted in comparable potency to the p110α/β/δ inhibitor. The disparity in efficacy was confirmed in vivo. Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis revealed that an inhibitor with insufficient potency
against the p110β isoform was less effective at inhibiting the PI3K pathway in PTEN-negative tumor xenografts. Our results imply that patients with PTEN-negative tumors may preferentially benefit from treatment
with a class I PI3K inhibitor that is capable of inhibiting the p110β isoform. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1164–72. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The phosphatidylinoisitol 3′-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway can be activated by a variety of extracellular signals and
is involved in cellular processes such as survival, proliferation, migration, and protein synthesis. Aberrant activation
of this pathway has been widely implicated in many cancers.
In recent years, several groups have reported mutations or
gene amplifications in the PI3K p110α catalytic subunit resulting in increased pathway signaling (1–3). The tumor suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)
acts to inhibit PI3K pathway signaling and is commonly mutated, deleted, or epigenetically repressed in human cancers
(4, 5). In addition, the pathway can be activated by mutations
or overexpression of upstream signaling molecules such as
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or ErbB2 (6–8).
Due to its involvement in many cancers, there is increasing
interest in the development of inhibitors of the PI3K pathway
as potential therapeutics.
Catalytic PI3Ks are lipid kinases and can be divided into
three different classes (class I, II, and III) according to their
structures, substrate preference, tissue distribution, and

mechanism of activation (9–11). Class I PI3Ks are best
known in terms of their function in regulating cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. They are composed of a catalytic
(p110) and an adaptor subunit (p85/p55/p101). There are
three known class IA p110 isoforms (p110α, p110β, and
p110δ) that interact with the adaptor subunits p55 and
p85. All class I PI3Ks possess intrinsic protein kinase activity
and are recruited to the membrane in a similar manner.
Recent studies involving knockout mice involving loss-offunction mutations in p110 knock-in mice, however, have
shown functional differences between the isoforms (12, 13).
Recent studies have shown that the p110α and p110δ isoforms are downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK),
whereas the two remaining class I isoforms (p110β and
p110γ) are activated through G-protein–coupled receptor
(GPCR) signaling (14, 15). The isoforms also possess differential tissue distribution. The p110α and p110β isoforms are
ubiquitously expressed, whereas p110δ and p110γ are found
predominately in leukocytes (16).
The most direct approach to inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway is to target PI3K itself. Wortmannin and LY294002 both
target the catalytic site of all class I p110 isoforms and have
been extensively used as research tools (17, 18). Some of the
observed effects of these compounds might not be due to inhibition of PI3K because both compounds exhibit a significant amount of off-target activity (17, 19). These inhibitors
also have limited use in vivo due to toxicities and poor pharmaceutical properties. In recent years, several PI3K inhibitors
with more favorable selectivity and in vivo properties have
entered clinical trials (reviewed in ref. 20). These inhibitors
target all class I PI3Ks and some display potency against
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).

Inhibition of Class I PI3K Isoforms in Cancer

One challenge to pharmacologic targeting of the PI3K family is to define the individual contributions of each class I isoform to the functions of normal and cancer cells. The use of
isoform-specific compounds would significantly facilitate defining the roles of each isoform, and selective small-molecule
inhibitors for p110β (TGX-221) and p110δ have already been
made (21, 22). It will be particularly important to understand
the contributions of p110α and p110β in solid tumors based
on their abundant expression in these tumors. Due to the involvement of the PI3K pathway in insulin signaling, normal
cell toxicities with p110 isoform inhibition must also be considered. Recent genetic studies have indicated that inhibition
of p110α can have effects on insulin signaling and glucose
metabolism (12). Clearly, an understanding of the balance
between efficacy and toxicities will be necessary.
In these studies, we investigated the effect of PI3K isoform–
selective inhibitors on viability and signaling in solid tumor
cell lines. We found that inhibition of the p110α and p110δ
isoforms was sufficient to impede growth to the same extent
as with inhibition of all three class IA p110 isoforms in lines
that contained functional PTEN protein. In cell lines lacking
the tumor suppressor PTEN, however, we found that inhibition of all three class IA p110 isoforms resulted in significantly
improved efficacy. These results were reproduced in vivo
when we compared a PI3K inhibitor with potency against
all isoforms to a similar inhibitor that lacks potency against
p110β, and observed differential efficacy in a PTEN-negative
xenograft model.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Cell lines were cultured in DMEM or RPMI
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37°C under
5% CO2. MCF7.1 is an in vivo selected cell line developed at
Genentech, Inc., and derived from the parental MCF7 human
breast cancer cell line (American Type Culture Collection).
Compounds and reagents. GDC-0941 and PI3Ki-A/D
were obtained from Genentech. TGX-221 was obtained from
Calbiochem.
Cell viability assays. Cells were seeded (1,000–2,000 per
well) in 384-well plates for 16 h. On day 2, nine serial 1:2 compound dilutions were made in DMSO in a 96-well plate. The
compounds were then further diluted into growth media
using a Rapidplate robot (Zymark Corp.). The diluted compounds were then added to quadruplicate wells in the 384well cell plates and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. After 4 d,
relative numbers of viable cells were measured by luminescence using Cell Titer-Glo (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and read on a Wallac Multilabel
Reader (Perkin-Elmer). EC50 values were calculated using
Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were treated with GDC-0941 or
PI3Ki-A/D at the indicated concentrations for 48 h, then harvested with 0.25% trypsin and washed with PBS. Cells at a
density of 1 × 106/mL were fixed in 100% ice-cold ethanol
and stored at −20°C overnight, then washed with PBS and
incubated in propidium iodide (PI) solution [0.1% Triton-X,

0.2 mg/mL RNase solution (Sigma), 0.05 mg/mL PI solution
(Sigma), in PBS] for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.
Cells were immediately analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
In vitro pharmacodynamic assays. Levels of pAkt
(Ser473) and pPras40 (Thr246) were assessed using bead kits
from Biosource and the Luminex Bio-Plex system measuring
fluorescence intensity (Bio-Rad). Levels of pS6 (Ser235/236)
were determined using an ELISA measuring absorbance at
450 nm (Cell Signaling Technology). For Western blots, equal
amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresis
through NuPage Bis-Tris 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen);
proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose pore membranes using the iBlot system and protocol from Invitrogen.
pAkt (Ser473) antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology. The PTEN antibody was obtained from BD Pharmingen. Specific antigen-antibody interaction was detected
with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody IgG using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences).
In vivo xenograft studies. Human prostate cancer PC3NCI cells obtained from the National Cancer Institute
(Frederick, MD) were resuspended in HBSS and implanted
s.c. into the right hind flanks of nude mice. Tumors were
monitored until they reached a mean tumor volume of 150
to 200 mm3 before the initiation of dosing. MCF7.1 cells resuspended in a 1:1 mixture of HBSS and Matrigel Basement
Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences) were s.c. implanted into
the right hind flank of each mouse. Before cell inoculation,
17β-estradiol (0.36 mg/pellet, 60-d release), obtained from Innovative Research of America, were implanted into the dorsal
shoulder blade areas of nude mice. After implantation of cells
into mice, tumors were monitored until they reached a mean
tumor volume of 250 to 350 mm3 before initiating dosing.
GDC-0941 and PI3Ki-A/D were obtained as solutions and dissolved in 0.5% methylcellulose with 0.2% Tween-80 (MCT). Female nude (nu/nu) mice that were 6 to 8 wk old and weighed
20 to 30 g were obtained from Charles River Laboratories.
Tumor-bearing mice were dosed daily for 14 to 21 d, depending on the xenograft model, with 100 μL of vehicle (MCT),
75 mg/kg GDC-0941, or 75 mg/kg PI3Ki-A/D orally.
Tumor volume was measured in two dimensions (length
and width) using Ultra Cal-IV calipers (model 54-10-111,
Fred V. Fowler Company) and was analyzed using Excel version 11.2 (Microsoft Corporation). Tumor volume (mm3) =
(longer measurement × shorter measurement2) × 0.5. Animal
body weights were measured using an Adventurer Pro AV812
scale (Ohaus Corporation). Percent weight change = [1 −
(new weight/initial weight)] × 100. Tumor sizes were recorded twice weekly over the course of the study (14–21 d).
Mouse body weights were also recorded twice weekly and
the mice were observed daily. Mice with tumor volumes
≥2,000 mm3 or with losses in body weight ≥20% from their
initial body weight were promptly euthanized per Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Mean tumor volume and SEM values (n = 10) were calculated using
JMP statistical software, version 5.1.2, at the end of treatment. Percent tumor inhibition = 100 × [(mean volume of

with JMP statistical software, version 5.1.2 (SAS Institute).
For pharmacodynamic analysis of the PI3K/Akt pathway
in vivo, NCI-PC3 or MCF7.1 tumors were excised from animals and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen
tumors were weighed and lysed with a pestle PP (Scienceware) in cell extract buffer (Biosource) supplemented with
protease inhibitors (F. Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd.), 1 mmol/L
phenylmethysufonyl fluoride, and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit. Levels of pAkt
(Ser473) and pS6 (Ser235/236) were assessed using kits measuring luminescence (Meso Scale Discovery). Levels of pPras40
(Thr246) were determined using an ELISA measuring absorbance at 450 nm (Biosource). Data were analyzed and P values were determined using Student's t test with JMP
statistical software, version 5.1.2 (SAS Institute). Tumor drug
concentrations were also measured from frozen samples by a
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay in
the Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetic Bioanalytical Department at Genentech, and the lower limit of quantitation
for detectable levels was 0.005 μmol/L.

Results
We used a pair of PI3K inhibitors (Table 1) with different
selectivity profiles than the p110 subunits of PI3K to investigate their therapeutic potential in solid tumors. GDC-0941 is a
pan inhibitor of PI3K with IC50 values in the low nanomolar
range for all three of the class IA p110 isoforms (23). PI3KiA/D is a selective inhibitor of the p110α and p110δ isoforms,

1166

sparing p110β inhibition more than 100-fold relative to the inhibition of p110α (24). Neither molecule significantly inhibits
mTOR or DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK; Table 1),
and both display excellent selectivity over a panel of 228 kinases in the KinaseProfiler panel from Millipore (ref. 23 and
data not shown).
To assess the in vitro effects of GDC-0941 and PI3Ki-A/D,
we investigated a panel of 102 solid tumor cell lines, consisting of breast, colon, glioma, non–small cell lung, melanoma,
ovarian, and prostate cancer cell lines, in a cell viability assay.
The two inhibitors were tested to obtain half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values to detect any significant difference in the sensitivity of the two inhibitors as single
agents (Supplementary Tables S1–S7). To identify molecular
markers that correlate with differential sensitivity between
the two compounds, we evaluated the genotypes and protein
expression levels of a set of genes in relevant signaling pathways in all of the cell lines. The only significant predictor of
sensitivity observed was PTEN status as assessed by the presence or absence of PTEN protein by immunoblotting, as well
as the presence of inactivating mutations in the PTEN sequence. There was no observed change in relative sensitivity
dependent on p110α activating mutational status (Fig. 1B).
The lines that were negative for PTEN showed higher sensitivity to GDC-0941 than they did to PI3Ki-A/D, with GDC0941 being on average 3.97-fold more potent (Fig. 1B).
PTEN-positive lines showed very similar sensitivity between
the two inhibitors, with an average difference of 1.59-fold.
When lines were grouped by PIK3CA and PTEN status, the
fold difference in sensitivity was statistically significant (P <
0.0001) between PIK3CA wild-type and PTEN-negative lines
as well as between PIK3CA-mutant and PTEN-negative lines
(Fig. 1B). This difference was observed across all tumor types
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

Inhibition of Class I PI3K Isoforms in Cancer

(PTEN negative), were treated with GDC-0941, PI3Ki-A/D, TGX-221, or the combination of PI3Ki-A/D and TGX-221, and assayed for viability using Cell
Titer-Glo. B, fold increase in viability EC50 values for PI3Ki-A/D relative to GDC-0941 in a full panel of 99 solid tumor lines binned by PIK3CA

by Student's t test. C, comparison of viability EC50 values (μmol/L) of solid tumor lines when separated into PTEN-positive and PTEN-negative cell
lines and dosed with GDC-0941, PI3Ki-A/D, or the combination of PI3Ki-A/D and TGX-221.

To confirm that the difference in sensitivity between GDC0941 and PI3Ki-A/D was due to their different p110 selectivity
profiles, we used a specific p110β inhibitor, TGX-221 (21). In
the PTEN-negative prostate line PC3, which was 3.5-fold
more sensitive to GDC-0941 than to PI3Ki-A/D, the addition
of TGX-221 to PI3Ki-A/D increases its potency to that of GDC0941 (Fig. 1A). In the PTEN-positive cell line MCF7.1,
which was equipotent for the two compounds, no increase
in sensitivity was observed with the addition of TGX-221 to
PI3Ki-A/D. The benefit of inhibiting p110β in PTEN-negative
cell lines and the lack of benefit in PTEN-positive lines were
observed across a panel of cell lines and across all tumor types
(Fig. 1C). We also found that TGX-221 has no observed effect
on cell viability as a single agent in PTEN-positive cells, whereas in the majority of PTEN-negative cell lines tested, it showed
a cell growth inhibitory effect of up to 40%, yet not enough inhibition to generate an EC50 value (data not shown).
To further investigate the effects of selective p110 isoform inhibition, we explored the effects of the different
compounds on RTK and GPCR stimulation. Recent studies
have implicated p110α as a mediator of RTK signaling and
p110β as a mediator of GPCR signaling (14, 15). We used
epidermal growth factor (EGF) to stimulate the EGFR

RTK and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to stimulate GPCR
signaling and monitored receptor activation by the increase
in pAkt. Both EGF and LPA were capable of inducing pAkt

greater extent than LPA stimulation. Although there was
some inhibition of LPA stimulation by PI3Ki-A/D, it was

minimal when compared with the inhibition by GDC-0941
dosed at a 3.5-fold lower dose.
We further investigated the role of inhibiting the class IA
p110 isoforms by examining downstream PI3K pathway
markers. We dosed all compounds at the EC50 doses of the

pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (0.81 μmol/L for MCF7.1 and
0.34 μmol/L for PC3), so that any difference in pathway marker
levels from PI3Ki-A/D could be attributed to the lack of inhibition of the p110β isoform. In MCF7.1 cells (PTEN positive),
GDC-0941 and PI3Ki-A/D both significantly reduced pAkt,
pPras40, and pS6 levels at 4 hours after treatment, whereas
TGX-221 did not have a significant effect on any of the markers
(Fig. 3A–C). Furthermore, the addition of TGX-221 to PI3Ki-A/
D did not reduce the levels of any of the markers to a greater
extent than did PI3Ki-A/D as a single agent. In contrast, in PC3
cells, GDC-0941 strongly reduced all three of the markers,
whereas both PI3Ki-A/D and TGX-221 had a significantly
weaker effect (Fig. 3A–C). Unlike MCF7.1 cells, PC3 cells
showed reduction equal to that with GDC-0941 of all three
pathway markers with the combination of PI3Ki-A/D and
TGX-221 (Fig. 3A–C).
To investigate the downstream effects of inhibiting all three
p110 isoforms versus p110α and p110δ only, cell lines were
treated with three doses (1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 μmol/L) of either
GDC-0941 or PI3Ki-A/D, stained with propidum iodide (PI),
and analyzed by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis at 48 hours after treatment (Fig. 4). The two compounds
increased the G 1 fractions equally in a dose-dependent
manner in the PTEN-positive cell line MCF7.1. However, in
PC3, the higher doses of GDC-0941 caused an increase in the
G1 fraction, whereas PI3Ki-A/D did so only minimally.
To confirm our in vitro findings in vivo, we compared GDC0941 and PI3Ki-A/D in PTEN-positive and PTEN-negative
xenograft models. In MCF7.1 breast tumor xenografts (PTEN
positive), PI3Ki-A/D and GDC-0941 were equipotent and statistically caused significant tumor inhibition (P < 0.0001)
compared with vehicle control–treated animals, when dosed
daily at 75 mg/kg (Fig. 5A). Alternatively, in NCI-PC3 prostate tumor xenograft models (PTEN negative), PI3Ki-A/D
was less potent and did not cause significant tumor inhibition
(P = 0.19) compared with vehicle control–treated animals,
whereas GDC-0941 resulted in significant tumor inhibition
when compared with vehicle control (P = 0.01; Fig. 5A). Additionally, the antitumor response between GDC-0941 and PI3Ki-A/D was significantly different (P = 0.04) in the NCI-PC3
model. The doses tested for PI3Ki-A/D and GDC-0941 were
well tolerated because body weights were comparable between the vehicle and treated animals (Supplementary

www.aacrjournals.org

Fig. S2) and produced similar drug tumor levels (Supplementary Table S8A and B).
The differences in efficacy between GDC-0941 and PI3Ki-A/D
in xenograft models correlated with the effect of each drug
on PI3K/Akt pathway suppression in vivo. GDC-0941 and
PI3Ki-A/D suppressed pAkt, pPras40, and pS6 equivalently
4 hours after a single dose in PTEN-positive MCF7.1 tumors
(Fig. 5B–D). Conversely, the effects on pAkt, pPras40, and
pS6 suppression were significantly less pronounced at
4 hours after a single dose of PI3Ki-A/D compared with an
equivalent dose of GDC-0941 in PTEN-negative NCI-PC3
tumors (Fig. 5B–D).

Discussion
Establishing the roles of p110α and p110β isoforms in cancer cell signaling has been complicated by the lack of specific
high-quality isoform-selective inhibitors. Here, we describe
the characterization of two potent and selective PI3K inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. GDC-0941 inhibits all class IA isoforms, whereas PI3Ki-A/D selectively blocks the activity of
p110α and p110δ. Neither compound potently inhibits DNAPK, TORC1, or TORC2, and both are selective for PI3K against
a large panel of other kinases. The compounds also have
similar pharmacokinetic properties in terms of clearance,
volume of distribution, and bioavailability (ref. 23; Table 2).
Use of these two inhibitors has allowed us to investigate the
effects of specific PI3K class IA isoform inhibition.
GDC-0941 and PI3Ki-A/D were tested in a large panel of
cancer cell lines to evaluate their cellular potency. In the majority of cell lines, the two inhibitors were equipotent in the
Cell Titer-Glo assay. In PTEN-negative lines, however, GDC0941 exhibited approximately 4-fold greater potency. Use of
the p110β inhibitor confirmed that the disparity between
PTEN-negative and PTEN-positive lines was due to an increased reliance on the p110β isoform. The potency differences of the inhibitors were also shown in the effects on
downstream biomarkers in the PI3K pathway. Although there
was increased efficacy with GDC-0941 over PI3Ki-A/D in
PTEN-negative lines, the two inhibitors were not significantly
different in cell lines harboring activating mutations in PIK3CA. Not only did PIK3CA mutational status fail to differentiate the two inhibitors but it also did not predict overall

Figure 5. In vivo pathway effects of GDC-0941 and PI3Ki-A/D. A, MCF7.1 breast tumor and NCI-PC3 prostate cells were implanted s.c. in the hind
flanks of female athymic nu/nu (nude) mice. Tumor-bearing mice were dosed orally with vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose/0.2% Tween-80), 75 mg/kg
GDC-0941, or 75 mg/kg PI3Ki-A/D for 21 or 14 continuous days for MCF7.1 or NCI-PC3, respectively. *, P values were determined by Student's t test.
B–D, MCF7.1 or NCI-PC3 tumor–bearing mice were given a single dose of vehicle (MCT), 75 mg/kg PI3Ki-A/D, or 75 mg/kg GDC-0941 orally and tumors
were harvested at 4 h post-dose. Tumor lysates were analyzed for pharmcodynamic changes by measuring pAkt (Ser473) (B), pPras40 (Thr246) (C),
and pS6 (Ser235/236) (D). P values were determined by Student's t test.

sensitivity compared with those cell lines that were wild type
for PIK3CA (Supplementary Fig. S3).
An increased role for p110β in PTEN-negative cancers and
cell lines has been described recently (25–27). Jia and colleagues used a conditional knockout approach to study the tumorigenic and metabolic contributions of p110β in mice.
Using a mouse prostate cancer model driven by PTEN loss,
the authors showed that a coincident loss of p110β resulted
in a striking decrease in prostate tumor formation, whereas
tumor generation was not affected by the loss of p110α in this
model. Our results in cell lines and xenograft models with
small-molecule inhibitors also support the importance of
p110β inhibition in PTEN-negative tumors, although inhibition of both p110α and p110β is needed to prevent tumor
growth in PTEN-negative tumors. Taken together, p110α
may not be needed for tumor initiation in PTEN-negative
tumors but seems to be required for tumor maintenance.
Similar results were found using an inducible shRNA system
to decrease the expression of class IA PI3K isoforms in PIK3CA-mutant and PTEN-deficient tumor cell lines (27). Consistent with previous data, PTEN-negative lines were strongly
dependent on p110β. Surprisingly, in the same PTEN-negative
lines, the authors showed that p110α was not required for
PI3K signaling or growth. These results differ from ours because we still observed efficacy in PTEN-negative tumors
and cell lines without inhibiting p110β. In fact, we detected

significant pathway inhibition with PI3Ki-A/D in these lines
at 4-hour treatments. The differences between these studies
are likely due to the kinetics of compound inhibition in comparison with protein knockdown by shRNA or any potential
noncatalytic effects of p110 isoforms. As expected, PIK3CAmutant lines proved to be highly dependent on the p110α isoform. A recent report describes a PTEN-associated complex
that contains p110β (28). The PTEN-associated complex
forms only when PTEN is not phosphorylated and has full enzymatic activity. Interestingly, the complex does not include
p110α and may suggest a possible mechanism for the increased role of p110β in PTEN-negative cancers.
Understanding the benefits and detriments of inhibitor
specificities for cancer treatment is a key challenge in biomedical research. A major obstacle in this process is the
availability of selective small-molecule tools. Here, we have
used two closely matched small-molecule inhibitors of
PI3K. The major difference between the two inhibitors is
their potency against p110β. We show that the two inhibitors
have similar activity in all tumors, except those lacking
PTEN, wherein the additional inhibition of p110β results in
increased potency. It is important to note, however, that the
p110α/δ inhibitor is still potent in PTEN-null cell lines and
tumors. Understanding the molecular pathology of the tumor
will be essential to matching patients with PI3K inhibitors of
differing selectivity profiles.
