Abstract
Small molecules that restore the expression of growth-inhibitory microRNAs (miRNA) downregulated in
tumors may have potential as anticancer agents. miR34a functions as a tumor suppressor and is downregulated or
silenced commonly in a variety of human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we
used an HCC cell–based miR34a luciferase reporter system to screen for miR34a modulators that could exert
anticancer activity. One compound identiﬁed as a lead candidate, termed Rubone, was identiﬁed through its
ability to speciﬁcally upregulate miR34a in HCC cells. Rubone activated miR34a expression in HCC cells with wildtype or mutated p53 but not in cells with p53 deletions. Notably, Rubone lacked growth-inhibitory effects on
nontumorigenic human hepatocytes. In a mouse xenograft model of HCC, Rubone dramatically inhibited tumor
growth, exhibiting stronger anti-HCC activity than sorafenib both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations
showed that Rubone decreased expression of cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and other miR34a target genes and that it enhanced
the occupancy of p53 on the miR34a promoter. Taken together, our results offer a preclinical proof of concept for
Rubone as a lead candidate for further investigation as a new class of HCC therapeutic based on restoration of
miR34a tumor-suppressor function. Cancer Res; 74(21); 6236–47. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be one of the
most common malignancies and is a leading cause of cancerrelated deaths due to the high mortality and unsatisfactory
treatment options available (1). It is of urgent signiﬁcance to
develop more effective therapeutics for HCC. microRNAs
(miRNA) are a class of single-stranded noncoding RNAs (2),
and it is estimated that 25% to 70% of human genes are
regulated by miRNAs (3, 4). The patterns of miRNAs expression
were proved to be correlated with cancer types, stages,
and other clinical variables (5). Therefore, the expression of
miRNAs could be applied as a tool for cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. In cancer cells, miRNAs could function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Their roles are manifested in

almost all aspects of cancer biology, such as proliferation,
apoptosis, invasion/metastasis, and angiogenesis (6). Recently,
a miR122 inhibitor has been evaluated in phase IIa clinical trial
for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This builds a
bright prospect for developing modulators of miRNAs for
disease treatment (7).
miR34 family constitutes three members: miR34a, miR34b,
and miR34c. All miR34 family members are direct targets of
p53. miR34b and miR34c share the same primary transcript
while miR34a resides in another one (8). miR34a has been
well documented as a tumor suppressor in previous studies
(9–13). Upregulation of miR34a could decrease the expression of a series of targets such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2),
cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), Forkhead box
protein P1 (FOXP1), Notch 1, and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Thereby,
miR34a could induce cell apoptosis, senescence, and inhibit
cellular differentiation and proliferation (14–16). miR34a
expression was dramatically downregulated or silenced in
various cancers including human HCC. Ectopic expression of
miR34a inhibited HCC cell migration and invasion (17).
Thus, restoration of miR34a might represent a potential
therapeutic for HCC.
Few studies have focused on small-molecule modulators of
miRNAs so far. Previously, the small-molecule modulators of
miR21 and miR122 have been identiﬁed with potent biologic
activities (18, 19). However, the small-molecule modulators of
miR34a have not been identiﬁed yet. In this study, we developed a luciferase reporter system for the screening of smallmolecule modulators of miR34a from a natural product library.
After library screening, one hit compound named Rubone was
found to activate miR34a expression in HCC cells. We further

miR34a Modulator Inhibits the Growth of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

investigated the anticancer activity of miR34a modulator in
both cell culture and animal models.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and drugs
The nontumorigenic human hepatocyte cell line MIHA (20)
was obtained from Dr. J.R. Chowdhury's laboratory at Albert
Einstein College of Medicine (New York, NY). The human
HCC cell line Huh7 (kindly provided by Dr. H. Nakabayashi,
Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan;
ref. 21) and Bel-7404 (Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences; ref. 22) were authenticated with short-tandem repeat
proﬁling by the vendors. The human HCC cell lines HepG2,
PLC/PRF/5 (PLC), and Hep3B (American Type Culture Collection) were veriﬁed by short-tandem repeat proﬁling at the
GENEWIZ, Inc. within 6 months of use. All cell lines were
cultured under the condition as previously described (23).
Carboxymethylcellulose was provided by Unitech Chemicals.
Sorafenib was purchased from Bayer Healthcare. Dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), Cisplatin (CDDP), 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU),
and doxorubicin were purchased from Sigma.
Constructs
The pmiR-REPORT luciferase plasmid (Ambion) was
sequentially digested with restriction enzyme SacI and HindIII
(10 units each in 50 mL reaction, NEB) and was puriﬁed after gel
electrophoresis. DNA oligos containing the miR34a-binding
site (50 -CTG GCA GTG TCT TAG CTG GTT GTA-30 and 50 -AGC
TTA CAA CCA GCT AAG ACA CTG CCA GAG CT-30 ), and
scrambled miR34a-binding site (50 -CTG TTT CGT TGG GCG
TTT CGA AGA-30 and 50 -AGC TTC TTC GAA ACG CCC AAC
GAA ACA GAG CT-30 ) were ordered from TechDragon. The
oligos were annealed at 95 C and then cooled to 4 C. The
annealed DNA fragments were then ligated into pmiR-REPORT
luciferase vector with T4 DNA ligase (200 U in 10-mL reaction,
NEB). The generated constructs containing miR34a-binding
site or scrambled binding site were named as miR34a reporter
or miR34a scr. The luciferase promoter constructs containing
miR34a promoter or miR34a mutant promoter were kindly
provided by Prof. J.T. Mendell from Johns Hopkins University
(Baltimore, MD; ref. 16).
Transfection
miR34a mimics duplex, single-stranded miR34a inhibitors
and siRNAs targeting p53 were purchased from Shanghai
GenePharma Co. The sip53 sequence was as following:
sip53a: 50 -CUA CUU CCU GAA AAC AAC G dTdT-30 ; sip53b:
GCA UGA ACC GGA GGC CCA U dTdT. The miR34a mimics,
inhibitors, and siRNAs were transfected into HCC cells using
DharmaFECT siRNA transfection reagent (Thermo Scientiﬁc)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids mentioned in previous section were transfected into HCC cells
using Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Library screening with miR34a reporter
Huh7 cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium (DMEM). 5  103 Huh7 cells were seeded into

www.aacrjournals.org

each well of 96-well plates and incubated for 12 hours at 37 C
with 5% CO2. Then, Huh7 cells were cotransfected with miR34a
reporter and Renilla luciferase pRL-SV40. The transfection
medium was replaced with complete DMEM after 4 hours
incubation. Compounds from natural products library (NPL;
NPL contained 640 compounds including natural products and
their derivatives; TimTec) were added to the cells at a ﬁnal
concentration of 10 mmol/L (0.1% DMSO at ﬁnal concentration). The complete DMEM containing 0.1% DMSO was used as
a control. After 48 hours of incubation, the luciferase activity
was measured.
Luciferase assay
miR34a reporter, miR34a promoter, and miR34a-mutant
promoter were transfected into HCC cells 12 hours before
compound treatment. The Renilla luciferase vector pRL-SV40
was cotransfected as an internal control. HCC cells were then
treated with compound for 48 to 72 hours. The luciferase
activity was measured by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
(Promega) with a Wallac VICTOR3V luminometer. The ratio of
ﬁreﬂy luciferase to Renilla expression was calculated for each
of the triplicates.
Total RNA and protein extraction
Total RNA from cell cultures and HCC xenograft tumors
were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's protocols. Total RNAs were dissolved into
nuclease-free ddH2O. For protein extraction, HCC cells and
xenograft tumors were lysed in 1 RIPA buffer with 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride (PMSF) and 1 complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Both RNA and protein were
stored at 80 C.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNAs using the
High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa). GAPDH
was used as an internal control. miR34a level was measured by
qRT-PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mixture (Invitrogen).
U6 was measured as an internal control. Fold change was
calculated by relative quantiﬁcation (2DDCt). The sequences of
the primers were listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Western blotting
Protein concentration was measured with BCA protein
assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Of note, 25 to 50 mg
protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and transferred to
poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride) (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies used in this study included anti-cyclin D1
(1:1,000 dilution; cat. no., 2922; Cell Signaling Technology),
anti-Bcl-2 (1:1,000 dilution; cat. no., AM2209, ABZOOM), antib-actin (1:5,000; cat. no., 4967; Cell Signaling Technology), and
anti-p53 (1:1,000; cat. no., Sc-126; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 C
overnight, and then washed three times with TBST (Trisbuffered saline plus Tween-20). The membranes were then

incubated with 1:3,000 peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by three washings in TBST. Protein expressions
were detected by autoradiography ﬁlm using Amersham ECL
Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare).
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was measured by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described
previously (24). Brieﬂy, 1  103 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates in triplicate and treated with compounds at indicated
concentrations for indicated time points. At each time point, a
set of cells was incubated with 0.5 mg/mL MTT diluted in 1
PBS. After 2 to 4 hours of incubation, the MTT solution was
removed. The insoluble MTT was dissolved in DMSO. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a Benchmark Plus
microplate reader (Bio-Rad).
In vivo HCC xenograft mouse model
A total of 5  106 HepG2 cells were suspended in 100 mL
serum-free medium and subcutaneously (s.c.) inoculated
into the dorsal ﬂanks of nude mice. When tumors reached
5 to 10 mm in diameter, mice were randomly divided into
four groups (n ¼ 5). Rubone and sorafenib were suspended
in a carboxymethylcellulose vehicle formulation, which contained 0.4% carboxymethylcellulose sodium and 0.9% NaCl.
Tumor-bearing mice were treated with 20 or 50 mg/kg
Rubone in 200 mL vehicle by gavage once every 2 days.
Vehicle alone and sorafenib were used as negative and
positive control, respectively. The starting date of treatment
was deﬁned as day 0. Tumor volumes and body weight were
measured once every 2 days. Tumor volume was calculated
as [(length  width  height)/2]. Treatment was continued
for 24 days. Finally, mice were sacriﬁced and tumors were
excised. Tumor weight was recorded. Tumor tissues were
collected for subsequent RNA extraction or tissue section.
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experimental Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of
Hong Kong (Shatin, Hong Kong).
Immunohistochemical staining
Immunohistochemical staining was performed on xenografted tumor tissues with proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA; 1:400 dilution; cat. no., SC-56; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p16 (1:200 dilution; cat. no., BM0174, ABZOOM), and p21
(1:250 dilution; cat. no., SC-397; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)speciﬁc antibodies. Subcutaneous tumor tissue sections were
incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 C. Mean positive cells
were calculated by averaging positive cells from three random
ﬁelds per slide.
TUNEL assay
Analysis of apoptotic cells in xenografted tumor tissues was
performed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The in situ cell
death detection kit was used by following the manufacturer's
protocol (Roche Diagnostics). Images of the sections were
taken by a ﬂuorescent microscope. Mean positive cells were

6238

Cancer Res; 74(21) November 1, 2014

calculated by counting TUNEL-positive cells from three random ﬁelds per slide.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described previously (25). Cross-linked chromatin
were incubated overnight with anti-H3 (cat. no., 4620; Cell
Signaling Technology), IgG (cat. no., 2729; Cell Signaling
Technology), p53 (cat. no., sc-126; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
The precipitated DNA were quantitated absolutely by real-time
PCR and normalized by respective 2% input.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software) was used for
statistical analysis. Four-parameter logistic model was
applied to calculate IC50. The two-tailed Student t test was
applied for paired data analysis. All data are expressed as
mean  SD from three separate experiments performed in
triplicate. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Identiﬁcation of small-molecule modulator of miR34a by
library screening
We ﬁrst established a luciferase reporter by cloning the
complementary sequence of miR34a into pmiR-Reporter vector (Fig. 1A). The scrambled miR34a-binding sequence was
used as a control. Theoretically, this miR34a reporter could be
used for screening miR34a modulators by measuring luciferase
signals (Fig 1B). The endogenous miR34a level in HepG2 cells
was signiﬁcantly higher (22.29-fold; P ¼ 0.0017) than that of
Huh7 cells as measured by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
We transfected miR34a reporter into HepG2 and Huh7 cells
respectively and measured the luciferase activities. The luciferase activities in Huh7 cells was signiﬁcantly higher (15.66fold, P ¼ 0.044) than that of HepG2 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Cotransfection of miR34a mimics and miR34a reporter decreased the luciferase signal in Huh7 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1C). Conversely, cotransfection of miR34a inhibitor and
miR34a reporter increased the luciferase signal in HepG2 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1D). No luciferase signal was changed in
control group where miR34a reporter was replaced with
miR34a scr. These results indicated that miR34a reporter was
responsive to miR34a level.
Using the miR34a reporter system, we screened the NPL
for miR34a modulators. The screening process was depicted
in Fig 1C. After a primary screening of 640 compounds in Huh7
cells, one hit compound named Rubone was found to be a
potential miR34a modulator (The full library screening dataset
was listed in Supplementary Table S2). Rubone was re-assayed
in triplicate with miR34a reporter system. Figure 1D showed
Rubone inhibited the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent
manner, with an IC50 value at 3.8 mmol/L. Rubone was a
chemically synthesized plant chalcone derivative, which was
also named 20 -hydroxy-2,4,40 ,5,60 -pentamethoxychalcone. Its
molecular weight was 374.39 and its chemical structure was
shown in Fig. 1D. Rubone has not been previously reported to
have any known biologic activities.

miR34a Modulator Inhibits the Growth of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Figure 1. Identiﬁcation of miR34a modulator through library screening. A, schematic illustration of miR34a reporter system. The complementary sequences
including mature miR34a and the scrambled miR34a sequence were cloned into pMIR-REPORT miRNA Reporter Vector (Ambion) to establish miR34a
reporter and miR34a. B, working mechanism of the miR34a reporter. The miR34a reporter could detect the presence of functional mature miR34a as
reﬂected by the rate of luciferase activity repression. C, the process of library screening for the identiﬁcation of miR34a modulators. D, a small-molecule
compound named Rubone signiﬁcantly inhibited the luciferase activity of miR34a reporter at a dose-dependent manner. Huh7 cells were transfected
with miR34a reporter and then treated with indicated concentrations of Rubone for 48 hours. Cell lysates were subjected to luciferase assay.
Results are expressed as luciferase activity values. Error bars represent mean  SD of three independent experiments.

We next examined whether Rubone modulated miR34a
expression in HCC cells. As shown in Fig 2, both primary and
mature miR34a levels signiﬁcantly increased after treatment
with Rubone in Huh7 and HepG2 cells. However, Rubone
caused no change in the expression of primary and mature
miR34a in Hep3B cells (Fig. 2). To note, mutant p53 and wildtype p53 was expressed in Huh7 and HepG2 cells, respectively,
while p53 was deleted in Hep3B cells. These results indicated
that Rubone modulated miR34a expression in HCC cells
expressing either wild-type or mutant p53 but not in HCC
cells with p53 deletion.
To exclude the possibility of nonspeciﬁc modulation on
miR34a expressions by Rubone, we measured the global
human miRNAs expression after Rubone treatment. The global
human miRNA proﬁling showed that Rubone preferentially
activated the expression of miR34a (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
We further demonstrated that other chemotherapeutic drugs
such as CDDP, 50 -FU, doxorubicin and sorafenib signiﬁcantly
inhibited HCC cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Among
these drugs, doxorubicin could induce the expressions of p53
and its downstream targets including p21 and Puma (Supplementary Fig. S2C). However, we found these drugs had no effect

www.aacrjournals.org

on pri-miR34a or miR34a expression in HCC cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D). These results indicated that Rubone preferentially modulated miR34a expression in HCC cells. Cyclin
D1 and Bcl-2 were two of the most well-studied miR34a targets
with important roles in HCC. We examined the expression
levels of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 after Rubone treatment. Rubone
signiﬁcantly reduced the mRNA and protein levels of cyclin D1
and Bcl-2 in Huh7 and HepG2 cells but not in Hep3B cells
(Fig. 3). Meanwhile, we measured the expression levels of other
miR34a targets including CDK6, FOXP, Notch 1, and SIRT as
well as p53 targets including p21 and Puma. Similarly, the
expression levels of these miR34a targets were decreased after
Rubone treatment in Huh7 and HepG2 but not in Hep3B cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2E), although there were no change
on the expression of p53 targets in these cells (Supplementary
Fig S2F).
miR34a modulator inhibited HCC cells growth in vitro
We next examined the anticancer activity of Rubone in vitro.
Five HCC cell lines and MIHA cell line were treated with
different concentrations of Rubone at indicated time points.
Cell viability was measured by the MTT assay. Rubone

Figure 2. Rubone increased miR34a expression levels in HCC cells. Huh7, HepG2, and Hep3B cells were treated with Rubone at the concentration of 10 mmol/L
or vehicle control for 48 hours. Then, RNA samples were prepared and the fold change of primary and mature miR34a levels were measured by qRT-PCR. Error

inhibited the growth of HepG2, Bel-7404, Huh7, and PLC in a
dose-dependent manner. There was little growth inhibition on
MIHA after Rubone treatment, suggesting no cytotoxicity of
Rubone to nontumorigenic human hepatocytes (Fig. 4A).
Similarly, Rubone caused no growth inhibition on Hep3B cells
in which p53 was deleted.
We also compared the growth inhibition effect of Rubone
and sorafenib on HCC cells. The results revealed that
Rubone exerted stronger growth inhibition on most HCC
cell lines including Bel-7404, HepG2, and Huh7, though
sorafenib exhibited stronger growth inhibition on PLC cells
at 24 hours. Rubone showed little growth inhibition on
Hep3B and MIHA cells, whereas sorafenib exhibited significant growth inhibition on these two cell lines at different
time points (Fig. 4B).
We asked whether Rubone inhibited HCC cell growth
through modulation of miR34a. HepG2, Bel-7404, and PLC
cells were transfected with miR34a mimics or inhibitors and
then treated with Rubone. Figure 4C showed that miR34a
mimics showed concomitant effect of growth inhibition with
Rubone to all HCC cell lines. Conversely, miR34a inhibitors

6240

Cancer Res; 74(21) November 1, 2014

attenuated the growth-inhibitory effect of Rubone. These
results indicated that Rubone inhibited HCC cell growth by
modulating miR34a expression.
miR34a modulator inhibited hepatocellular tumor
growth in vivo
We next examined the in vivo anticancer activities of Rubone
in HepG2 xenografted nude mice model. The tumor-bearing
mice were gavaged with Rubone. The anti-HCC agent sorafenib
was used for efﬁcacy comparison. As shown in Fig 5A and
Supplementary Table S3, the tumors in vehicle control showed
a fast and stable growth. HepG2 xenografts were sensitive to
sorafenib with a tumor growth inhibition rate at 84.22% (P ¼
0.0013 vs. vehicle control) at the dose of 50 mg/kg. Rubone
delayed the growth of tumors by 78.27% (P ¼ 0.0070 vs. vehicle
control) and 89.64% (P ¼ 0.0010 vs. vehicle control) at the dose
of 20 and 50 mg/kg, respectively. Rubone exhibited a stronger
tumor growth inhibition than sorafenib at the same dosage of
50 mg/kg (P ¼ 0.047 vs. sorafenib-treated group; Supplementary Table S3). When comparing the anticancer activities of
Rubone and sorafenib during the whole treatment process,

miR34a Modulator Inhibits the Growth of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Figure 3. Rubone decreased the
expression of miR34a targets. Huh7,
HepG2, and Hep3B cells were
treated with Rubone at the
concentration of 10 mmol/L or
vehicle control for 48 or 72 hours.
RNA samples collected at 48 hours
were applied for measuring miR34a
targets cyclin D1 and Bcl2 by
qRT-PCR. The cell lysates collected
at 72 hours were subjected to
Western blotting. Speciﬁc
antibodies against cyclin D1
(1:2,500 dilution), Bcl-2 (1:2,500
dilution), and b-actin (1:5,000
dilution) were used. Error bars
represent mean SD of three
independent experiments.

Rubone exhibited higher anticancer activities than that of
sorafenib (Fig. 5B). Another xenografted nude mice model
was established by using Huh7 cells. In this model, we also
found that Rubone signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth
when compared with the vehicle control. The tumors from
Rubone-treated group were smaller and lighter when compared with the sorafenib-treated group (Supplementary Fig.
S3A–C).
The expression levels of pri-miR34a, miR34a, cyclin
D1, and Bcl-2 in the xenografted tumors were measured by
qRT-PCR. In Rubone-treated tumors, both pri-miR34a and
miR34a levels were upregulated, while miR34a targets cyclin
D1 and Bcl-2 were downregulated (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Sorafenib treatment caused no change in the
expression of miR34a and its targets (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S4A). These results could also be validated
in Huh7-xenografted nude mice model (Supplementary
Fig. S3D). Moreover, there was no obvious body weight loss
in the treated mice compared with vehicle control (Supplementary Table S3). Meanwhile, we also treated Balb/C mice
with Rubone (200 mg/kg) for 24 days. No obvious side effect
was observed at the end of the experiment (Supplementary
Fig. S4D). These results indicated that Rubone was an
effective and safe anti-HCC agent in animal.

miR34a modulator inhibited proliferation and induced
apoptosis in HepG2 xenografts
TUNEL staining was performed to assess the in vivo apoptosis induction by Rubone in HepG2 xenografts. The average
number of apoptotic cells increased from 13/area in the control
group to 109/area (P ¼ 0.0033) in the Rubone-treated group
(Fig. 6A). The in vivo antiproliferative effect of Rubone treatment on HCC xenografts was investigated by PCNA immunostaining. Qualitative analysis showed a signiﬁcant decrease
in the average number of PCNA-positive cells after Rubone
treatment (P ¼ 0.011 vs. vehicle control; Fig. 6B). In addition,
p21 and p16 stainings were performed to assess cell senescence
in HCC xenografts. There were no signiﬁcant change in the
number of p21 and p16-stained positive cells between control
and Rubone-treated groups (Fig. 6C and D). Triggering proliferation inhibition and apoptosis are important hallmarks for
an effective anticancer chemotherapeutic agent. These results
indicated Rubone inhibited HCC growth by inhibiting cell
proliferation and elevating level of apoptosis but not inducing
cell senescence.
We also found that the subcutaneous tumors treated with
Rubone were visibly less vascularized compared with the
control group. Tumors were then stained with endothelial
marker CD31. The new blood vessels were highly vascularized

Figure 4. Rubone inhibited HCC cell growth in vitro. A, Rubone inhibited the growth of HCC cells in a dose-dependant manner. HCC cell lines HepG2, Huh7,
Hep3B, Bel-7404, PLC, and MIHA were treated with Rubone at designated concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 mmol/L for 48 hours. B, the comparison
between the inhibition effect of Rubone and sorafenib on HCC cell growth at different time points. HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B, Bel-7404, PLC, and MIHA cell lines
were treated with 10 mmol/L Rubone or sorafenib for 0 to 72 hours. The differences between Rubone- and sorafenib-treated group was considered as
signiﬁcantly when P < 0.05 ( , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01; and    , P < 0.001 vs. sorafenib-treated group, n ¼ 4). C, Rubone inhibited HCC cell growth by modulating
miR34a expression. HepG2, Bel-7404, and PLC cells were treated with Rubone at the concentration of 10 mmol/L alone or in combination with 2 mmol/L
miR34a mimics or inhibitors for 72 hours. All cell viabilities were measured by the MTT assay. Error bars represent mean  SD of three independent

in the control group, while tumors treated with Rubone had
signiﬁcantly reduced microvessels (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
We next found that Rubone caused a dose-dependent inhibition on tube formation of HUVECs in vitro (Supplementary
Fig. S4C). These results suggested that antiangiogenesis may be
another potential molecular mechanism by which Rubone
exerts its in vivo anti-HCC effect.
miR34a modulator increased miR34a promoter
activities and p53 occupancy on miR34a promoter
Because both primary and mature miR34a were increased
after treatment with Rubone, we next examined whether
Rubone could modulate miR34a promoter activity. HCC cell
lines with different p53 status (HepG2: p53 wild-type, Bel-7404:

6242

Cancer Res; 74(21) November 1, 2014

p53 mutant, Hep3B: p53 deletion) were used for promoter
activity assay. These three cell lines were ﬁrst transfected with
miR34a promoter or miR34a promoter without p53-binding
site (miR34a-mutant promoter), and then were treated with
Rubone. No luciferase activity change was observed in miR34amutant promoter transfected HCC cell lines. miR34a promoter
activities were both increased in HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells but
not in Hep3B cells (Fig. 7A). These results suggested a potential
role of p53 in Rubone modulation of miR34a promoter activity.
We ﬁrst found there were no signiﬁcant change in
p53 expression level after Rubone treatment in HepG2 and
Bel-7404 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Then, we used two
independent siRNAs targeting p53 (sip53a and sip53b) to
knockdown both wild-type and mutant p53 (Supplementary

Fig. S5B and S5D), and followed by Rubone treatment in HepG2
and Bel-7404 cells. qRT-PCR results showed that miR34a
level decreased after p53 knockdown (Fig. 7B). Moreover,
the increased expression level of miR34a by Rubone was
signiﬁcantly attenuated by p53 knockdown (Fig. 7B). Meanwhile, pri-miR34a expressions exhibited similar change with
that of miR34a in HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5C and S5E). The MTT assay further revealed that the
growth-inhibitory effect of Rubone on HCC cells was also
signiﬁcantly reversed by knocking down p53 (Fig. 7C and
Supplementary Fig. S5F). These results suggested that p53
played important role in the biologic activity of Rubone. We
next used ChIP assay to examine whether Rubone could
modulate p53 activities. The results showed that Rubone
treatment signiﬁcantly increased p53 occupancy on miR34a
promoter in both HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells. The effect of
Rubone on p53 was speciﬁc to miR34a promoter, as we showed
that Rubone failed to increase p53 occupancy on p21 promoter
that was a reported p53-binding region. (Fig. 7D).

Discussion
miR34a is well known to play important roles in the pathogenesis of human diseases, such as metabolic diseases (26),

www.aacrjournals.org

cardiac diseases (27–29), and malignancy. miR34a was dramatically reduced or silenced in a large portion of clinical
samples from patients with HCC (30–32). Because miR34a
functions as an effective suppressor of malignant properties in
cancers (9–13), reexpression of miR34a in tumors represents a
potential approach for HCC treatment. Indeed, such potential
has been illustrated in numerous studies. It is showed that
systemic miR34a delivery suppressed tumor growth in xenograft or genetically engineered mouse models (33). Furthermore, overexpression of miR34a in HCC cells signiﬁcantly
inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis (17, 34, 35).
Despite the need for the development of miR34a-based therapeutic treatment, few strategies are developed that are limited to direct introduction of miR34a into human cells such as
systemic delivery of miR34a molecules or viruses. Here, we
identiﬁed a small molecule Rubone that acted as the modulator of miR34a level. Rubone induced miR34a in HCC cells, but
not the nontumor MIHA cells. In contrast, systemic delivery of
miR34a will lead to uptake of miR34a by normal cells that
induce undesirable miR34a gene silencing.
The discovery of Rubone as the agent against HCC can
improve the current therapeutic strategies. The efﬁcacy of
available chemotherapeutic drugs for HCC is low (36). Sorafenib is a forefront therapeutic agent for HCC treatment, which

showed certain efﬁcacy for patients with HCC by inhibiting
Raf-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways
(37). However, sorafenib-treated patients have mild overall
survival beneﬁts from the treatment and a signiﬁcant number
of them experiences disease progressions (38). Moreover,
sorafenib shows toxicity to normal cells (Fig. 4B) and elicits
serious side effect such as hand-foot skin reaction (39) and
eruptive melanocytic lesions (33). Other agents such as sunitinib and brivanib fail to show superiority to sorafenib (40, 41).
Therefore, it is still of urgent clinical signiﬁcance to develop
novel therapeutics with better efﬁcacy and less side effect.
Our results showed that Rubone exhibited similar or even
higher anti-HCC potency compared with sorafenib. Regarding
the unspeciﬁc toxicity, Rubone did not show any toxicity to
nontumor hepatocytes MIHA cells. In addition, Rubone treatment showed no impairment of the tissues of major organs in
BALB/C mice (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Therefore, Rubone
warrants further investigation as a potential effective anti-HCC
agent. Besides, miR34a was reported to enhance the sensitivity
of anti-HCC effect induced by sorafenib (42), which suggested a

6244

Cancer Res; 74(21) November 1, 2014

potential combined treatment of Rubone and sorafenib in
HCC. Meanwhile, given previous studies demonstrated
increased miR34a in setting of heart disease (27–29), a thorough assessment of Rubone on cardiac function in future
studies will be required in the future.
Our study suggested that the action of Rubone to induce
miR34a expression is p53-dependent. Previous study has
revealed p53 directly and positively regulated the expression
of miR34a (8). More than 50% of human tumors contain
mutation or deletion of p53 gene (43). However, there is still
no report on the relationship between miR34a and mutant p53.
Our study showed that Rubone required wild-type or mutant
p53 to effectively reactivate miR34a expression, suggested for
the ﬁrst time that mutant p53 could also modulate miR34a
expression. Many p53 mutations possess gain-of-function
effect, but not inactivation of p53 function. For example, the
A220G mutation in huh7 cells lowers the melting temperature
and stability of p53 in its DNA-binding domain, causing the
denaturation of p53 (44). Study also showed that alterations
induced by p53 mutation can be reversible (45). Another HCC

miR34a Modulator Inhibits the Growth of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Figure 7. Rubone activated miR34a expression by increasing p53 activities. A, Rubone modulated miR34a promoter activity. The arrow above construct P
indicates the position of the transcription start site. Filled circles show the position of the p53-binding site. The miR34a promoter reporter constructs were
transfected into HepG2, Hep3B, and Bel-7404 cells, respectively. The luciferase activities were measured after 10 mmol/L Rubone treatment. B and C,
knockdown of p53 reversed miR34a expression and cell growth inhibition induced by Rubone in HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells. HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells were
transfected with 2 mmol/L siRNAs targeting p53 and then treated with 10 mmol/L Rubone. miR34a level was measured by qRT-PCR. Cell viability was
measured by the MTT assay. D, Rubone increased p53 occupancy on miR34a promoter. ChIP assay was conducted in HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells treated with
10 mmol/L Rubone. qPCR was used to quantify the p53 occupancy on miR34a and p21 promoter regions. Error bars represent mean SD of three independent
experiments.

cell line PLC that was responsive to Rubone expressed G249Tmutated p53. It is showed that a designed peptide can rescue
the structural distortion of G249T-mutated p53 (46). In these
p53-mutant–expressing cells, the function of p53 is diminished
but not abolished and evidence suggested that the function of
p53 mutant could be modulated. It is possible that Rubone acts
as a modulator during the p53-mediated transactivation of
miR34a. Besides, we believed that the multiple molecular role
of p53 determined the speciﬁcity of Rubone to induce miR34a
expression. Rubone may restore or enhance a particular
molecular function of p53, such as DNA-binding ability or
cofactor recruiting ability, which is either in a normal state in
wild-type p53 or suboptimal state in mutant p53. This function
is indispensible for the activation of miR34a expression. In this
respect, it is understandable that Rubone failed to reactivate
miR34a in Hep3B cells with p53 deletion. Yet, the effect of
Rubone to p53 is still unknown, which requires further investigation. Our studies showed different p53 response induced by
Rubone compared with other chemotherapeutic drugs. We
speculate that the reason may be that Rubone worked through

www.aacrjournals.org

different mechanism compared with other chemotherapeutic
drugs.
Practically, the use of Rubone as therapeutic treatment is
feasible in HCC. We showed that Rubone could induce
miR34a expression with wild-type or mutant p53, but not in
p53-deleted cells. In HCC, the most common type of p53
alteration is point mutation. Over 50% of human aﬂatoxininduced HCC harbor G249T mutation (47), while non-aﬂatoxin-induced, HBV-related and HCV-induced HCC have low
mutation rate (48, 49). More importantly, deletion of p53 is
rare in human HCC (50). Therefore, Rubone is a suitable agent
to treat HCC that retains p53 in cancer cells.
