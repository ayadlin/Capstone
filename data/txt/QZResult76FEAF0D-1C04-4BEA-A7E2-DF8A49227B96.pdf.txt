BACKGROUND: Fertility-sparing management is an important treatment for young women who have endometrial
carcinoma (EC). Many patients with EC exhibit insensitivity or resistance to progestin therapy, and the molecular
mechanisms of that insensitivity and resistance have been elusive. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression has been observed in EC, but the roles of EGFR in progestin resistance have not been investigated.
METHODS: EGFR and progesterone receptor isotype B (PR-B) messenger RNA and protein levels were determined in
EC tissue samples and cell lines by immunohistochemical, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
and Western blot analyses. The biologic function of EGFR in the regulation of PR-B expression and induced progestin
resistance was investigated by transfecting recombinant plasmids that expressed EGFR into Ishikawa EC cells. In
addition, the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway was investigated by Western blot
analysis. RESULTS: EGFR was detected in 60% of PR-B–positive samples and in 90.5% of PR-B–negative samples
(P ¼.015). EGFR expression was higher in progestin-resistant KLE EC cells than in progestin-sensitive Ishikawa EC
cells. In contrast, PR-B expression was higher in Ishikawa cells than KLE cells. Higher EGFR expression reduced sensitivity to progestin and decreased PR-B expression in Ishikawa cells; it also abnormally activated the MAPK signaling
pathway and inhibited cell apoptosis. The EGFR tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor AG1478 effectively inhibited the proliferation of EC cells that overexpressed EGFR. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that EGFR overexpression may play an important role in reducing sensitivity to progestin treatment in EC.

Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is 1 of the most common gynecologic malignancies.1,2 The number of women aged

40 years who are diagnosed with EC has increased in the last decade. Fertility-sparing management often is considered a
promising option by patients who have early stage EC and wish to preserve their fertility.
Progestins, especially synthetic progestins like medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), have been effective in the treatment of early stage EC in young women and reportedly have produced response rate that range from 57% to 75%.3,4
However, >30% of patients with EC exhibit insensitivity or resistance to progestin therapy at diagnosis, and 40% to 50%
of patients with EC who initially respond to progestin treatment eventually will develop resistance and experience tumor
progression.5,6 Unfortunately, the mechanisms involved in progestin resistance in EC are unclear. Understanding the
cause of progestin resistance in EC is very important in fertility-sparing treatment.
The presence of the progesterone receptor (PR) is correlated strongly with successful endocrine treatment and survival,7 whereas loss of the PR is associated with progestin resistance and enhanced EC progression.8 Lower levels of PR

isotype B (PR-B) have been associated with compromised
survival, suggesting a critical role for PR-B in the development of EC.9 However, the association with PR-B does
not fully explain the mechanism of progestin resistance.
The up-regulation of growth factors or their receptors may contribute to the resistance and progression of
cancer, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor
(EGFR) expression in human EC. EGFR overexpression
has been correlated with cancer progression and a poor
prognosis.10-12 Overexpression of EGFR may play an important role in activating the growth factor signaling pathway. Inappropriate activation of the EGF signaling
pathway reportedly led to the failure of antihormone therapy in breast cancer.13,14 Long-term MPA treatment has
induced progestin resistance in Ishikawa cells along with
higher EGFR expression and lower PR-B expression.15
Accordingly, we hypothesized that the overexpression of
EGFR would trigger progestin resistance in Ishikawa
human EC cells that initially expressed sensitivity to both
PR-B and MPA. In the current study, we developed an
EGFR overexpression model by transfecting the EGFR
gene into Ishikawa cells to evaluate our hypothesis and to
investigate the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue Selection and Immunohistochemical
Analysis
Paraffin-embedded endometrial tissue samples were collected for immunohistochemical analysis from patients
with endometrial adenocarcinoma at the Sixth People’s
Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in accordance
with human subject guidelines approved by the Scientific
and Ethical Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
Disease surgical stage and tumor grade were determined
according to criteria outlined in the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system
(grade 1 tumors, n ¼ 29 patients; grade 2 tumors, n ¼ 18
patients; grade 3 tumors, n ¼ 9 patients; stage I disease,
n ¼ 35 patients; stage II disease, n ¼ 14 patients; stage III
disease, n ¼ 7).16 The mean patient age was 55.5 years
(range, 21-76 years). Expression of EGFR and PR-B protein was examined using the avidin-biotin complex/immunoperoxidase method.17 Deparaffinized sections were
treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous
peroxidase activity. After the sections were blocked with
5% normal serum for 20 minutes, they were incubated
with rabbit anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution; Epitomics, Burlingame, Calif), rabbit anti-PR-B

3604

monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution; Cell Signaling
Technology, Boston, Mass), or no antibody as a primary
antibody control overnight at 4 C. After rinsing with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody and avidin-biotin complex/horseradish peroxidase. Peroxidase activity
was observed using 3,30 -diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Two independent investigators evaluated the immunohistochemical staining without knowledge of the clinical
pathologic parameters. Semiquantitative assessment of
the immunohistochemical results followed methods that
were described previously10: The integrated optical density was determined from at least 5 random fields in each
section at high magnification (400).
Cell Cultures
The human EC cell lines Ishikawa and KLE kindly were
provided by the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan
University and the First People’s Hospital of Shanghai
Jiao Tong University. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco
modified eagle medium-F12 medium (Hyclone, Logan,
Calif) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 lg/
mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 2 mM L-glutamine (Hyclone). The cells were maintained in 25-cm2
tissue culture flasks (Corning Glass Works, New York,
NY) at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon
dioxide.
Plasmid Preparation and Insert Identification
The pLWERNL plasmid, which contains full-length
EGFR combinational DNA (cDNA), and the pLRNL
plasmid. which contains no genes, were kindly provided
by Dr. Frank Furnari (W. Canenee Lab, Ludwig Institute
for Cancer Research, University of California-San Diego,
San Diego, Calif). The pLRNL plasmid was used as a negative control. The pLWERNL and pLRNL plasmid constructs were cloned in DH5a-chemically competent
Escherichia coli cells. Plasmid minipreparations were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). Plasmids were digested with
restriction enzymes and separated on agarose gels to confirm the expected insert size. The insert sequence was verified by automated sequencing.
In Vitro Transfection
The transfection of plasmids was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Briefly, 1.5  105 Ishikawa cells were plated onto 24-well
plates and grown for 1 day. When the cells had reached
90% to 95% confluence, each plasmid and Lipofectamine
2000 were diluted in 50 lL of Opti-MEM I reduced
serum medium (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, Md) and
incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. After combining at a 1:2 ratio (1 lg plasmid with 2 lL Lipofectamine 2000), the mixtures were incubated for 20 minutes
at room temperature. Then, the cells were transfected
with 100 lL of this mixture in a final volume of 500 lL
per well and incubated at 37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator
for 24 hours. Subsequently, cells were diluted 1:10 in
fresh growth medium, incubated for another 24 hours,
and the growth medium was replaced with medium that
contained G418 (600 mg/L; Invitrogen) to select stable
clones. These clones were verified later by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analyses with the
EGFR antibody.

RNA Extraction and Real-Time Reverse
Transcripase-PCR
RNAiso Plus (Takara Shuzo Company, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) was used to extract total RNA from the cells. Total
RNA (1 lg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA with a
reverse transcription kit (Takara Shuzo Company, Ltd.).
A real-time, quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR
was performed with 1.5 lL diluted cDNA with a Light
Cycle 3.0 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Ind) using the SYBR Green I
PCR Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Takara Shuzo Company, Ltd.). The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 95 C for 10 seconds; 40 cycles at
95 C for 5 seconds, 60 C for 20 seconds, and 65 C for
15 seconds. The gene-specific primers for EGFR
(NM_005228) were 50 -GACAGCTATGAGATGGAG
GAA-30 (sense) and 50 -GAGTCACCCCTAAATGCCA30 (antisense)18 and produced a 200-base pair amplification product. The primers for PR-B (NM_000926) were
50 -ACACCTTGCCTGAAGTTTCG-30 (sense) and 50 CTGTCCTTTTCTGGGGGACT-30 (antisense)19 and
produced a 196-base pair amplification product. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was the
used as the reference gene. Primers for GAPDH (NM002046) were 50 -GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC-30
(sense) and 50 -ATGGTGGTGAAGACGCCAGT-30
(antisense) and produced a 142-base pair amplification
product. PCR products were evaluated in a melting curve
analysis.

Western Blot Analysis
Cells were harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer (0.15 M
NaCl; 1% NP40; 0.01 M deoxycholate; 0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate [SDS]; 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 10 lg/mL each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and
leupeptin). Equal aliquots of protein were separated by
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% for extracellular signal-regulated kinase [Erk] and GAPDH; 7.5%
for EGFR and PR-B). Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Subsequently, the
membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature
in 5% skim milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and
probed with each primary antibody overnight at 4 C.
Membranes were then rinsed and incubated for 1 hour
with a secondary antibody. The signal was observed by
chemiluminescence using standard detection reagents
(Pierce, Rockford, Ill). An antibody against GAPDH was
used as the internal control. Antibodies against EGFR,
Erk1/2, phosphorylated-Erk1/2 (p-Erk1/2), PR-B, and
GAPDH were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology.

Cell Proliferation Analyses
Cell proliferation was determined with the Cell Counting
Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo Molecular Technologies,
Kumamoto, Japan). Cells (4000-5000 cells per well) were
seeded into a 96-well plate. After a 72-hour treatment, 10
lL of CCK-8 solution were added to each well. After a 2hour incubation, the absorbance was measured at 450 nm
using a microplate reader.

Apoptosis Analysis
Cells were plated into 6-cm diameter dishes and grown
for 24 hours. The medium was changed to serum-free
medium for 18 hours. MPA (1 lM) or an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (control) was added for a
72-hour treatment. Cells were trypsinized, washed with
cold PBS, resuspended in binding buffer, and annexin
V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium
iodide were added according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif). After
staining with this kit, flow cytometry distinguished
between apoptotic cells and viable cells. The percentages of early apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive and
propidium iodide-negative) cells were calculated from
the flow-cytometric data.

The EGFR/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase
Signal-Transduction Pathway Assay
Ishikawa cells were incubated in serum-free medium for
18 to 20 hours and were washed twice with PBS. Either
EGF or transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-a) cytokine (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was added to a final concentration of 10 ng/mL, and the cells were incubated for
up to 120 minutes. After harvesting cells, protein was
extracted for Western blot analysis of p-Erk1/2 protein
expression, as described above. The effect of the MPA or
EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif)
was assessed on the EGFR/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway by pretreating the cells
with either 1 lM MPA for 48 hours or 10 lM AG1478
for 4 hours, incubating with 10 ng/mL EGF or TGF-a
for 15 minutes, and processing for the Erk phosphorylation assay.
Statistical Analysis
Results for all experiments were analyzed using Student t
tests or 1-way analyses of variance and the chi-square test.
Differences were considered statistically significant at P <
.05. Each experiment was performed in triplicate to verify
the reproducibility of the results. SPSS 11.0 software was
used to perform statistical analysis (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
EGFR and PR-B Expression in EC Tissues
Immunohistochemical staining revealed EGFR positivity
in 62.8% of stage I EC samples and in 85.7% of stage II

3606

and III EC samples (P ¼ .017). EGFR positivity also
occurred in 62.1% of grade 1 EC samples and in 81.5%
of grade 2 and 3 EC samples (P < .001). In addition,
EGFR positivity differed significantly between PR-B–
positive EC samples (60%) and PR-B–negative EC samples (90.5%; P ¼ .015) (Table 1). The EGFR staining
intensity also was stronger in PR-B–negative samples than
in PR-B–negative samples. EGFR staining was localized
predominantly to the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas
PR-B staining was detected in the cytoplast and cytoplasm
(Fig. 1).
EGFR, PR-B Expression, and Growth
Inhibition by MPA Treatment in Ishikawa
and KLE Cells
The 2 EC cell lines (Ishikawa and KLE cells) differ in progestin sensitivity, and their expression of EGFR and PR-B
was compared. EGFR messenger RNA (mRNA) was
detected in both Ishikawa cells and KLE cells, whereas
PR-B mRNA was detected only in Ishikawa cells. On the
basis of qRT-PCR, EGFR mRNA levels were >20 times
higher in KLE cells than in Ishikawa cells (P < .001) (Fig.
2A). PCR products were observed on 2% agarose electrophoresis gels to confirm the primer specificity. Protein
expression of EGFR and PR-B determined by Western
blot analysis was consistent with the qRT-PCR results
(P < .001) (Fig. 2B). The inhibitory effect of MPA treatment (concentration, 0.01-10 lM) on the proliferation of
Ishikawa and KLE cells was assessed. MPA treatment
inhibited the growth of Ishikawa cells in a time-dependent

treatment stimulated the proliferation of KLE cells (Fig.

Ishikawa Cells Transfected With EGFR Failed
to Retain Sensitivity to MPA
The effect of EGFR overexpression on the antiproliferative effect of MPA treatment was explored further by
establishing 2 cell lines: 1) Ishikawa-pLRNL cells were
stably transfected with the empty vector pLRNL and
served as a control cell line, and 2) Ishikawa-pLWERNL
cells were stably transfected with the EGFR overexpression vector (Fig. 4A,B). The basal transcription level of
EGFR was 5.3-fold greater in Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells
than in parental Ishikawa and Ishikawa-pLRNL cells (Fig.
4A). Similarly, Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells expressed significantly higher levels of EGFR protein than parental
Ishikawa cells and Ishikawa-pLRNL cells (Fig. 4B).
The sensitivity of the 3 Ishikawa-based cell lines to
the antiproliferative effect of MPA was determined with
the CCK-8 assay. Ishikawa-pLRNL cells remained sensitive to MPA, similar to parental Ishikawa cells. The
growth of parental Ishikawa cells was inhibited by 16%,
23%, and 35% at MPA concentrations of 0.1 lM, 1 lM,
and 10 lM, respectively. Similarly, Ishikawa-pLRNL cells
were inhibited 17%, 24%, and 35% at 0.1 lM, 1 lM;,

and the inhibitory effect was <5% at 10 lM MPA
(Fig. 5).
The effect of MPA on apoptosis in these cells was
examined by annexin V-FITC, staining which detected
early stage apoptotic cells. Transfection with the EGFR
expression vector reduced the proportion of annexin Vpositive cells approximately 3-fold compared with parental Ishikawa cells, whereas Ishikawa-pLRNL cells
remained as sensitive to MPA as parental Ishikawa cells
(Fig. 6).

EGFR Overexpression, MPA, EGF, and TGF-a
Decreased PR-B Expression
Because EGFR transfection was correlated with lost sensitivity to MPA in Ishikawa cells, the effect of EGFR overexpression was investigated on PR-B. On the basis of
qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses, PR-B expression
was reduced in Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells compared with
parental Ishikawa cells. No changes occurred in the control Ishikawa-pLRNL cells (Fig. 4A,B).
Analogous to the antiproliferative effects of MPA on
MCF-7 breast cancer cells that express PR-B, MPA also
inhibited the growth of parental Ishikawa EC cells.
Because Ishikawa cells expressed significant levels of PRB, the effect of MPA on PR-B expression in parental Ishi-

It is believed that TGF-a and EGF are the 2 most
important ligands of EGFR and can promote EC cell
growth. The effects of these exogenous growth factors on
PR-B expression were explored in parental Ishikawa cells.
After treatment with TGF-a or EGF, cells were harvested
and lysed, and PR-B protein levels were determined by
Western blot analysis. EGF and TGF-a decreased PR-B
expression in parental Ishikawa cells (Fig. 7B,C).

Elevated EGFR Abnormally Activated the
EGFR/MAPK Cell Signaling Pathway
TGF-a and EGF activate the EGFR/MAPK cell signaling
pathway by binding EGFR and promoting its phosphorylation. Activation of the EGFR/MAPK pathway by
TGF-a and EGF was assessed by comparing phosphorylation levels of Erk1 and Erk2, the major molecules in this
pathway. A time-course analysis of Erk1/2 activation in
parental Ishikawa and Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells treated
with 10 ng/mL TGF-a or EGF was carried out using antip-Erk1/2 and Erk1/2 antibodies. Both growth factors
activated Erk1/2, and the phosphorylation levels of Erk1
and Erk2 peaked at 30 minutes in parental Ishikawa cells

It is noteworthy that TGF-a exposure induced a peak of

EGF peaked by 15 minutes (Fig. 8B). The activation of
Erk1/2 was transient and decreased gradually within 2
hours.
The role of the EGFR/MAPK pathway on MPA
sensitivity was examined further in parental Ishikawa and
Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells induced with TGF-a or EGF.
Briefly, parental Ishikawa and Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells
were treated with MPA for 48 hours and subsequently
were stimulated with 10 ng/mL of TGF-a or EGF for 15

EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) activation is a
key step in the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway. EGFRTK levels were elevated in Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells
compared with controls (Fig. 9A). To evaluate the role of
EGFR-TK activation, all 3 cell lines were incubated with
the EGFR-TK–specific inhibitor AG1478. Stronger inhibitory effects on the proliferation of IshikawapLWERNL cells were associated with lower doses of
AG1478. The inhibitory effects were 11%, 16%, and
24% for AG1478 concentrations of 1 lM, 5 lM, and 10
lM, respectively. However, a significant reduction in
growth (19%) was observed in Ishikawa cells when the
AG1478 concentration reached 10 lM (P < .05) (Fig.
9B). Dual drug treatment (1 lM MPA combined with 5
lM AG1478 for 72 hours) increased the inhibitory effects
on Ishikawa-pLWERNL and KLE cells (P < .05) (Fig.

EGFR/MAPK pathway, cells were treated with 10 lM
AG1478 for 4 hours and then exposed to growth factors
for an additional 15 minutes. In parental Ishikawa cells,
the EGFR/MAPK pathway remained activated, and the
phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 did not change significantly after treatment with AG1478. However, phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was blocked in Ishikawa-pLWERNL
cells. These results suggested that the EGFR/MAPK pathway was inhibited and that Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells
were more sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effect of the
special EGFR-TK inhibitor AG1478 than parental Ishikawa cells (Fig. 9D,E).

DISCUSSION
Progestin has been widely considered an effective endocrine treatment for patients with early stage EC who want
to preserve their fertility and for patients with late-stage or
recurrent EC. However, some patients experience no significant benefit from treatment with progestins like MPA.
Although the mechanisms are not well understood, PR
expression is associated with an improved prognosis in EC
patients who are treated with progestin.7 PR-B is the fulllength form of PR and, compared with PR-A, is a stronger
transcriptional activator of many PR element-containing
promoters.20 PR expression, especially PR-B, appears to
be essential to progestin action, because the inhibitory
effects of progestin on cell growth and invasiveness may
occur primarily through PR-B activity.21 A decrease in
PR-B expression reportedly indicated a poor prognosis for
patients with EC who had MPA resistance in Ishikawa EC
cells.21
EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs
to the erbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors and is overexpressed in EC compared with normal cycling endometrium.22,23 In addition, EGFR overexpression has been
correlated with cancer progression and a poor prognosis.10,24,25 In our study, the presence or absence of EGFR
in EC was correlated with surgical stage and histologic
grade, and a significant inverse correlation was observed
between positivity for EGFR and PR-B (P ¼ .017) in the
PR-B–negative EC samples.
KLE is a poorly differentiated EC cell line that lacks
PR-B expression.26 In the current study, we observed that
EGFR expression was much higher in KLE cells than in
Ishikawa cells, which are well differentiated EC cells of
glandular origin. Similar to a previous study,27 we
detected PR-B expression only in Ishikawa cells and not in

KLE cells. We observed that MPA inhibited the growth of
Ishikawa cells but stimulated the proliferation of KLE
cells, analogous to its effects on PR-B divergent tumor
cells.28 Hanekamp et al28 demonstrated that MPA inhibited tumor growth in PR-positive cells but stimulated the
spread of PR-negative cells. Mice that were inoculated
with PR-negative cells and administered MPA developed
massive abdominal tumors. Zhao et al15 demonstrated
that MPA-resistant Ishikawa cells induced by long-term
MPA treatment displayed elevated EGFR expression and
reduced PR-B expression.
It was not previously known whether EGFR overexpression could reduce sensitivity to MPA in Ishikawa
cells. Thus, we developed a cell-based model of high
EGFR expression by transfecting the EGFR gene into
Ishikawa cells to evaluate this hypothesis. Compared
with parental Ishikawa cells, MPA no longer was an
effective treatment for Ishikawa cells that overexpressed
EGFR. EGFR overexpression delivered sustained proliferation signals to the cell, interfered with normal
cell differentiation, and suppressed cell apoptosis.
Furthermore, the apoptotic action of MPA on Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells declined compared with parental
Ishikawa and Ishikawa-pLRNL cells.
In this study, we sought to identify the factors that
contribute to the insensitivity of these cells. The relative
expression of PR may be a key determinant of cellular
responses to endocrine treatment. Previous studies have
demonstrated that PR-B expression is reduced in progestin-resistant cells, such as breast and EC cells.13,15 An examination of PR-B expression revealed reduced levels of
PR-B in Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells compared with parental Ishikawa and Ishikawa-pLRNL cells. Furthermore,
PR-B expression modulated sharply throughout the menstrual cycle, being high during midcycle and disappearing
completely in the late secretory phase; whereas PR-A was
expressed more steadily throughout the cycle. This diverse
expression pattern indicates that progesterone may inhibit
PR-B expression. In the current study, PR-B expression
was inhibited by MPA treatment even at the low concentration of 0.1 lM.
Several researchers have reported that TGF-a and
EGF were expressed at higher levels in progestin-resistant
cancer cells than in progestin-sensitive cancer cells and
that such expression contributed to progestin resistance.29
MPA-resistant EC cells exhibited enhanced TGF-a
expression. Our studies also demonstrated that TGF-a or
EGF treatment of Ishikawa cells reduced PR-B expression
in a dose-dependent manner.

TGF-a and EGF are the most important ligands for
EGFR, and the EGFR/MAPK pathway regulates multiple
biologic processes that contribute to malignancy, including gene expression, cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, cell motility, and cell adhesion. PR-B localizes to
both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas PR-A is primarily nuclear. PR-B, but not PR-A, is able to mediate
progestin activation of MAPK.30 Our studies indicated
that TGF-a and EGF treatment of cells that overexpressed
EGFR (Ishikawa-pLWERNL) more rapidly activated
Erk1/2 of the EGFR/MAPK pathway. Furthermore,
MPA pretreatment of parental Ishikawa cells increased
phosphorylation of Erk1/2; however, these effects were
not detected in Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells. These findings
suggest that EGFR transfection and overexpression are
correlated with the loss of MPA sensitivity in Ishikawa
cells.
Our study also demonstrated that the expression
of EGFR-TK was higher in Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells
than in parental Ishikawa cells. AG1478, an EGFRTK–specific inhibitor, suppressed the proliferation of
parental Ishikawa cells and Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells.
However, Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells were more sensitive
to the growth-inhibitory effect of AG1478 than parental
Ishikawa cells. AG1478 pretreatment reduced the ability
of TGF-a and EGF to induce Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylation in Ishikawa-pLWERNL cells, but not in parental Ishikawa cells. Similarly, uterine leiomyoma cell
growth effectively was blocked by AG1478 and was
unaffected by the presence of physiologic concentrations
of progesterone and estradiol.31 The TK inhibitor
ZD1839 (gefitinib) has been tested as single-agent treatment for women with advanced EC in a phase 2 trial
by the Gynecologic Oncology Group. A preliminary
analysis of the 29 enrolled patients on that study
revealed that 1 patient (3%) experienced a complete
response, and several others had stable disease at 6
months.32 These data raise the possibility that EGFRTK inhibitors may be effective treatments for patients
with MPA-resistant EC.
In conclusion, the overexpression of EGFR inappropriately activates the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway
and may contribute to reduced PR-B expression and
increased progestin resistance in EC. The identification of
EGFR and PR-B expression before MPA treatment may
provide additional important information for clinical
treatment. We plan to further investigate these findings
and their implications in future clinical work and
research.
