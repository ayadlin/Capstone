Abstract
In this study, we investigated adaptive mechanisms associated
with aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance in breast cancer cells
and show that sensitivity to AIs can be extended through dual
inhibition of estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal
receptor-2 (Her-2) signaling. We used human ER-positive
breast cancer cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene
(MCF-7Ca). These cells grow as tumors in nude mice and are
inhibited by AIs. Despite continued treatment, tumors
eventually become insensitive to AI letrozole. The cells
isolated from these long-term letrozole-treated tumors
(LTLT-Ca) were found to have decreased ERA levels. Our
results suggest that LTLT-Ca cells survive estrogen deprivation
by activation of Her-2/mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway. Here, we show that trastuzumab (antibody
against Her-2; IC50 = 0.4 mg/mL) was very effective in
restoring the ERA levels and sensitivity of LTLT-Ca cells to
endocrine therapy by down-regulation of Her-2/MAPK pathway and up-regulation of ERA. In contrast, trastuzumab was
ineffective in the parental hormone-responsive MCF-7Ca cells
(IC50 = 4.28 mg/mL) and xenografts. By blocking Her-2,
trastuzumab also up-regulates ERA and aromatase expression
and hypersensitized MCF-7Ca cells to E2. We show that
trastuzumab is beneficial in hormone-refractory cells and
xenografts by restoring ER, implicating Her-2 as a negative
regulator of ERA. In xenograft studies, the combination of
trastuzumab plus letrozole is equally effective in inhibiting
growth of MCF-7Ca tumors as letrozole alone. However, on the
acquisition of resistance and increased Her-2 expression, the
combination of letrozole plus trastuzumab provided superior
benefit over letrozole or trastuzumab alone. [Cancer Res
2009;69(4):1416–28]

may eventually occur in others. To investigate the mechanisms
involved in the loss of sensitivity of the tumors to AIs, we
developed a cell line isolated from tumors of human ER+ breast
cancer cells (MCF-7) stably transfected with aromatase (MCF-7Ca)
grown in mice treated with letrozole for an extended period of time
(1–3). We have previously reported that during treatment with
letrozole, MCF-7Ca xenografts up-regulate human epidermal
receptor-2 (Her-2) and proteins in the downstream mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (1). These cells
also exhibited lower expression of ERa and apparent ‘‘estradiolindependent’’ growth. We have also shown that signaling pathways,
such as the Her-2/MAPK, are key regulators of the growth of
letrozole-refractory cells (1, 4). Similarly, several other investigators
have reported the importance of members of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) family (Her-2/EGFR) in resistance to
endocrine therapy (5–8). We and others have suggested that the
combination of EGFR/Her-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors or trastuzumab (monoclonal humanized antibody against Her-2, Herceptin)
in combination with AIs or AEs may delay acquisition of resistance
(4, 9–13).
In this study, we investigated the effects of trastuzumab on the
growth of letrozole-refractory breast cancer cells. On examination,
MCF-7Ca–derived tumors treated with letrozole up-regulated Her2 4 weeks into treatment despite continued responsiveness to
letrozole. Moreover, the level of Her-2 protein was found to be 6fold higher in letrozole-refractory tumors than the control tumors
(1). However, when Her-2 was inhibited, ERa levels were restored.
This suggests that Her-2 is a negative regulator of ERa. This
observation led to our hypothesis that inhibition of both the Her-2
and estrogen signaling pathways is required to prolong the
responsiveness of the tumors to endocrine therapies (14, 15).
Thus, the combination of an AI plus Her-2 inhibitor could
provide a substantial benefit in tumor growth inhibition when used
after the acquisition of letrozole resistance.

Introduction
Aromatase inhibitors (AI) such as letrozole and anastrozole that
reduce estrogen production have now been shown to be more
effective than antiestrogen (AE) tamoxifen in estrogen receptor–
positive (ER+) breast cancer patients and have few side effects.
Nevertheless, not all patients respond and resistance to treatment

Duarte, CA). Letrozole was provided by Dr. D. Evans (Novartis Pharma,
Basel, Switzerland). The pure AE fulvestrant and anastrozole were
supplied by Dr. E. Anderson (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield,
United Kingdom).
Cell culture. MCF-7Ca cells were routinely cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and
700 Ag/mL G418. LTLT-Ca cells were developed from MCF-7Ca cells as
described earlier from tumors of mice treated with letrozole for 56 wk (1). The
cells were maintained in steroid-depleted medium, which consisted
of phenol red–free IMEM supplemented with 5% dextran-coated charcoaltreated serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 750 Ag/mL G418 and
1 Amol/L letrozole. Cell proliferation assays were performed using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as
described earlier (4). The results were expressed as a percentage of the cell
number in the D4A-treated control wells. IC50 values for inhibitors were
calculated from the linear regression line of the plot of percentage inhibition
versus log inhibitor concentration.
Tumor growth in ovariectomized female athymic nude mice. All
animal studies were performed according to the guidelines and approval of
the Animal Care Committee of the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Female
ovariectomized BALB/c athymic nude mice 4 to 6 wk of age were obtained
from the National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and
Development Center (Frederick, MD). The mice were housed in a
pathogen-free environment under controlled conditions of light and
humidity and received food and water ad libitum.
The tumor xenografts of MCF-7Ca cells were grown in the mice as
previously described (1, 16, 17). Each mouse received s.c. inoculations in one
site per flank with 100 AL of cell suspension containing f2.5  107 cells.
The mice were injected daily with D4A (100 Ag/d). Weekly tumor
measurements and treatments began when the tumors reached
f300 mm3. Mice were assigned to groups for treatment so that there
was no statistically significant difference in tumor volume among the
groups at the beginning of treatment. Letrozole and D4A for injection were
prepared in 0.3% hydroxypropylcellulose. Trastuzumab for injection was
prepared as 20 mg/mL stock solution in bacteriostatic water for injection
and then diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution to obtain the required
concentrations. Mice were then injected s.c. five times weekly with the
indicated drugs: 100 Ag/mouse/d D4A plus 10 Ag/mouse/d letrozole or
10 Ag/mouse/d letrozole plus trastuzumab or 100 Ag/mouse/d D4A plus
trastuzumab for indicated time. The doses of letrozole and D4A used are as
previously determined and reported (1, 2). Mice in the trastuzumab group
received 5 mg/kg/wk of the drug i.p. divided in two doses. Mice in the D4A
and trastuzumab group were treated for 7 wk, after which they were
sacrificed due to large tumor volumes by decapitation and the blood was
collected for analysis. The other groups (letrozole, trastuzumab plus
letrozole, letrozole switched to trastuzumab plus letrozole, and letrozole
switched to trastuzumab) were sacrificed on week 28.
Western blotting. The protein extracts from tumor tissues were
prepared by homogenizing the tissue in ice-cold DPBS containing protease
inhibitors (18). A total of 50 Ag protein from each sample was analyzed by
SDS-PAGE as described previously (4). Bands were quantitated by
densitometry using Molecular Dynamics Software (ImageQuant). The
densitometric values are corrected for loading control.
Competitive binding studies. Binding of trastuzumab to ER in MCF7Ca cells was assessed by competitive binding assay as described before (3).
MCF-7Ca cells were transferred to steroid-depleted medium for 1 d before
plating for the binding assay. 3H-E2 was used as a ligand and nonradiolabeled E2 was used to determine nonspecific binding. Triamcinolone
(1 Amol/L) was used to saturate glucocorticoid receptors.

H2O release assay for aromatase activity measurement. The
radiometric 3H2O release assay was performed as described previously
(19). For pretreatment studies, cells were treated with indicated agent for
24 h before incubating with [1-h3H]D4A for 18 h. For measuring aromatase
activity in tumor samples, the tumors were homogenized in ice-cold DPBS.
The resulting homogenate was used for aromatase activity assay (19). The
activity of the enzyme is corrected for protein concentration in the tumor
homogenates and cells.

ERA transactivation assay. To measure activation of ERa, an ELISAbased ER transactivation assay was performed as per manufacturer’s
guidelines (Panomics). Briefly, the nuclear lysates of cells or tumors were
generated as described by the manufacturer. Activated ER from nuclear
extracts was allowed to bind to an ER consensus binding site (ER probe) on
a biotinylated oligonucleotide. These oligonucleotides were then immobilized on a streptavidin-coated 96-well plate. The ER bound to the
oligonucleotide is then detected by an antibody directed against ER. An
additional horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody provided
colorimetric readout quantified by reading absorbance at 450 nm.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription. RNA was extracted and
purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer’s protocol.
Total RNA concentration and purity were determined from 260 and 280 nm
absorbances. RNA was diluted with water to 0.08 Ag/AL and reverse
transcribed as described by Kazi and colleagues (20).
PCR. Analysis of ERa, CYP-19, and pS2 mRNA expression was done by
conventional PCR. Each 30 AL reaction consisted of 3 AL reverse
transcriptase, 3 AL 10 buffer, 2.4 AL deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix,
3 AL 5 Amol/L primer mix, 0.15 AL Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen), and
18.45 AL molecular biology–grade water. The following primers were
used for the PCR analysis: human pS2, 5¶-ACCATGGAGAACAAGGTGAT-3¶
( forward) and 5¶-AAATTCACACTCCTCTTCTG-3¶ (reverse; ref. 21); human
ERa , 5¶-GATCCTTCTAGACCCTTCAGTG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TCTTCCAGAGACTTCAAGGTGCT (reverse); human CYP-19, 5¶-GAATATTGGAAGGATGCACAGACT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGGTAAAGATCATTTCCAGCATGT-3¶ (reverse; refs. 19, 22); and human 18s rRNA, 5¶-CAACTTTCGATGGTAGTCGC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CGCTATTGGAGCTGGAATTAC-3¶
(reverse; ref. 20).
ChIP assay. For in vitro ChIP assay, the treated cells were washed with
DPBS and fixed with 1% formaldehyde/DPBS for 10 min at 37jC, after
which the cells were washed with ice-cold DPBS containing protease
inhibitors. The cells were collected into 1 mL DPBS and pelleted by
centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 5 min at 4jC. The cell pellet was
resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (ChIP kit, Upstate) and incubated on
ice for 15 min.
For in vivo ChIP assay, tumor slices were immersed in 2% formaldehyde/
DPBS mixture and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Fixation was
stopped by adding 1 mol/L glycine and incubating for 5 min at room
temperature. The tissues were rinsed in ice-cold DPBS containing the
protease inhibitor tablet and homogenized on ice in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. The tissue homogenate was centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4jC; the nuclear pellet was resuspended in nuclear
lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 15 min. Samples were sonicated on ice for
10  10 s cycles, with 20-s pauses between each cycle. The sonicated samples
were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4jC. Sonicated samples were
diluted 1:10 with dilution buffer (ChIP kit) before being immunocleared in a
solution containing protein A- or G-Sepharose slurry (Amersham) in Tris/
EDTA buffer, salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen), and normal mouse or rabbit
serum (Sigma Chemical) for 2 h at 4jC. Immunocleared supernatants were
incubated overnight at 4jC with anti-ERa antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein A- or G-Sepharose beads and salmon sperm DNA were then
added and incubated for 1 h at 4jC. The beads were then washed sequentially
with 1 mL each of wash buffers. The protein-DNA complexes were then eluted
by twice incubating beads in elution buffer for 10 min at room temperature
with vigorous mixing. To separate immunoprecipitated protein and DNA, the
pooled elutes were incubated at 65jC overnight. The DNA was purified using
the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). Alternatively, immunoprecipitated ERa on the beads was subjected to Western immunoblotting. The
boiled (denatured) protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
membranes were probed for histone H3 and RNA polymerase II.
The yield of target region DNA in each sample after ChIP was analyzed
by conventional PCR. The following primers were used for PCR analysis
(34 cycles at 60jC annealing temperature): human pS2, 5¶-GGCCATCTCTCACTATGAATC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGCAGGCTCTGTTTGCTTAAA-3¶
(reverse; ref. 20); human CYP-19 Promoter I.3/II, 5¶-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3¶ (reverse; ref. 23).

Figure 1. A, effect of trastuzumab on
proliferation of MCF-7Ca and LTLT-Ca
cells in vitro . Viability of cells was
measured by MTT assay after 6-d
treatment with trastuzumab as described in
Materials and Methods. The treatment
with trastuzumab is significantly more
effective in reducing cell viability of
LTLT-Ca cells compared with MCF-7Ca
cells at all doses. At each dose of
trastuzumab tested (0.1–10 mg/mL) in
LTLT-Ca cells, growth was inhibited
significantly better (*, P < 0.0001) than in
MCF-7Ca cells. B, effect of trastuzumab
treatment at various time points on the
expression of protein in the Her-2/MAPK
pathway, ERa, and aromatase in LTLT-Ca
cells. Expression of proteins was
examined using Western immunoblotting
as described in Materials and Methods.
Blot shows Her-2, p-Her-2 at 185 kDa,
p-MAPK, MAPK at 42 to 44 kDa,
p-p90RSK at 90 kDa, p-Elk-1 at 41 kDa,
ERa at 66 kDa, aromatase at 55 kDa, and
h-actin at 45 kDa. The blots show a
single representative of three independent
experiments.

The promoter that was analyzed was I.3/II, which is the main aromatase
promoter used in breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 (24) and thus
measures the effect of trastuzumab on endogenous aromatase in MCF-7
cells. The MCF-7Ca cells contain human placental aromatase cDNA
(placental CYP-19 uses promoter I.1 and I.2; ref. 25).
Statistics. For in vivo studies, mixed-effects models were used. The

estimate and compare an exponential variable (bi) controlling the growth
rate for each treatment groups. The original values for tumor volumes were
log transformed. In the process of searching for a suitable model, we
observed that the piecewise (knot at 15 wk) model fits the data reasonably
well (on groups switched after week 15 to another drug). The spline model
with a single knot at time = week-15 wk was used to accommodate the
nonlinearity with a piece-wise linear model.

Trastuzumab Reverses Letrozole Resistance

Figure 1. Continued. C, effect of
trastuzumab treatment at various doses on
the growth of LTLT-Ca xenografts.
LTLT-Ca xenografts were grown in female
OVX nude mice as described in Materials
and Methods. The mice in the control
and letrozole-treated group exhibited
similar rate of tumor growth. The difference
in the exponential variable governing
growth was 0.027 (P = 0.71) over first
8 wk and 0.001 (P = 0.97) over 19 wk. Four
doses of trastuzumab were tested. All of
the tested doses caused a marked
regression of LTLT-Ca xenografts. The
growth rate of tumors of mice treated with
trastuzumab (5 mg/kg/wk) was significantly
different from mice in the control
(P = 0.0008) and letrozole-treated
(P = 0.0002) mice. The difference in the
exponential variable governing growth
between control and trastuzumab was
0.24 (P = 0.0008). The difference in the
exponential variable governing growth
between letrozole and trastuzumab was
0.27 (P = 0.0002). D, effect of combination
of trastuzumab with AEs tamoxifen and
fulvestrant and AIs exemestane and
anastrozole in LTLT-Ca cells. Viability of
cells was measured by MTT assay after 6-d
treatment with AEs and AIs in the presence
or absence of 100 Ag/mL trastuzumab as
described in Materials and Methods. The
generalized linear model method was
applied to estimate and assess differences
among groups’ means. The cell viability
was found to be significantly lower in
treatment groups treated with the
combination of trastuzumab plus AI or
AE versus control (*, P < 0.0001) or
trastuzumab alone (*, P < 0.0001) or the
endocrine agent alone (*, P < 0.0001).

All P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The graphs are
represented as mean F SE.

Results
Trastuzumab inhibits growth of LTLT-Ca cells and tumors
and down-regulates MAPK activation. Trastuzumab was found
to inhibit growth of LTLT-Ca cells in a dose-dependent manner
with an IC50 of 400 Ag/mL (2.75 Amol/L) compared with
4.28 mg/mL (29.41 Amol/L) in parental MCF-7Ca cells (Fig. 1A).

www.aacrjournals.org

In LTLT-Ca cells, trastuzumab (100 Ag/mL) also decreased the
activation of proteins of the MAPK pathway along with Her-2 in a
time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). This down-regulation was
initiated as early as 15 minutes and was sustained until at least
72 hours. In addition, ERa was nearly restored to the level of the
parental MCF-7Ca cells.
To study the effect of trastuzumab in vivo, LTLT-Ca cells were
inoculated s.c. into ovariectomized nude mice. The following day,
the mice were divided in two groups. One group received letrozole
(n = 5) and the other group received vehicle only (control, n = 25).

When the tumors of the mice in the control group reached
f300 mm3, this group was regrouped into five (n = 5) and injected
with vehicle or 2, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/wk of trastuzumab i.p.
(divided in two doses). As shown in Fig. 1C, the tumors in all of
the trastuzumab-treated groups regressed over the course of the
experiment. The dose of 5 mg/kg/wk trastuzumab was selected for
future investigations. As shown previously (1), treatment with
letrozole did not result in a statistically significant difference in
tumor growth than observed in controls (P = 0.91).
Trastuzumab restores sensitivity of LTLT-Ca cells to AEs and
AIs. As shown in our earlier studies, LTLT-Ca cells exhibit crossresistance to growth-inhibitory effects of tamoxifen, fulvestrant,
exemestane, and anastrozole (1). However, the combination of
trastuzumab (100 Ag/mL) with AEs or AIs produced synergistic
growth inhibition. As shown in Fig. 1D, the combination of
trastuzumab with AE/AI at 1 Amol/L each produced synergistic

growth inhibition. The combination was statistically better than
either drug alone (P < 0.0001) or control (P < 0.0001), whereas
single drug treatment with AE or AI was not statistically different
from control. As shown in Fig. 2A, proliferation of LTLT-Ca cells
was not inhibited with letrozole (10 12 to 10 5 mol/L), whereas
cotreatment with trastuzumab (100 Ag/mL) and letrozole
inhibited the growth of LTLT-Ca cells in a dose-dependent
manner. However, in MCF-7Ca cells, the combination of letrozole
plus trastuzumab was not significantly different from letrozole at
10 9 to 10 5 mol/L but different from letrozole alone at 10 12 to
10 10 mol/L (Fig. 2B). Although the IC50 value of letrozole in the
presence of trastuzumab was 2-log lower than that in the
absence of trastuzumab, it should be noted that this effect was
not seen in vivo.
The effect of combining trastuzumab plus letrozole was also
examined in letrozole-refractory LTLT-Ca xenografts (data not

Trastuzumab Reverses Letrozole Resistance

shown). The tumors of mice receiving trastuzumab plus letrozole
regressed significantly in volume. The combination was significantly better than trastuzumab alone (P < 0.0001), letrozole alone
(P = 0.0001), and control (P < 0.0001), although trastuzumab alone
was significantly better than control (P < 0.0001). These data
suggest that combining letrozole plus trastuzumab was significantly more effective than single agent in letrozole-refractory LTLTCa xenografts (26).
Trastuzumab up-regulated ERA- and E2-mediated transcription in LTLT-Ca cells. Treatment with trastuzumab upregulated ERa in LTLT-Ca cells (Fig. 1B). The maximum increase
of ERa was seen at 24 hours and was found to be 0.83-fold
compared with basal level of ERa in MCF-7Ca cells. A 10-fold
higher level of ERa was found in LTLT-Ca cells compared with
basal levels (0.83 compared with 0.08). In addition, trastuzumab
pretreatment followed by E2 treatment for 1 hour increased
ER-mediated transcription in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C).
A 72-hour pretreatment of LTLT-Ca cells with trastuzumab
followed by 1 hour of E2 treatment induced ERa transcriptional
activation to the same extent as in parental MCF-7Ca cells
stimulated with E2 alone.
In vitro ChIP assay and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
analysis were performed to examine the effect of trastuzumab
alone or in combination with E2 on ERa-mediated transcription.

When stimulated with trastuzumab, MCF-7Ca and LTLT-Ca cells
exhibit increased transcriptional activation as evidenced by
increase in the expression of pS2 mRNA, a known ERa-responsive
gene. This transcriptional activation was found to be dose
dependent (Fig. 2D). In addition to pS2, the transcription of ERa
and CYP-19 gene was found to be up-regulated in a dosedependent manner. In vitro ChIP assay was performed to examine
recruitment of ERa to the promoter region of pS2 and aromatase
gene. The Western blotting for histone H3 confirms recruitment of
ERa to the DNA and RNA polymerase II expression confirms
transcriptional activation (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, E2
treatment in MCF-7Ca cells induces recruitment of ERa to the pS2
promoter. Similarly, trastuzumab induced association of ERa to the
pS2 promoter region. However, trastuzumab plus E2 were not able
to increase this association further. In LTLT-Ca cells, the basal level
of promoter activity was not changed with E2 or trastuzumab
treatment. However, the combination of E2 plus trastuzumab
increased the recruitment of ERa to the pS2 promoter by 1.9-fold
compared with the control. These results confirm that trastuzumab
induces ERa-mediated transcription of downstream genes such as
pS2. In addition, ERa was also recruited to the aromatase I.3/II
promoter after treatment with trastuzumab, E2, and the combination in LTLT-Ca cells. In MCF-7Ca cells, trastuzumab and E2
increase recruitment of ERa to the aromatase I.3/II promoter;

however, the combination did not increase this further. The
MCF-7Ca cells may require different treatment period with
trastuzumab to exhibit similar effect. These results suggest that
trastuzumab activated the aromatase transcription in ERadependent manner in LTLT-Ca cells.
Trastuzumab amplified mitogenic effects of estradiol
in vitro and in vivo. E2 stimulation of MCF-7Ca cells resulted in
a typical biphasic dose-response curve where maximum stimulation occurs at a concentration of f10 9 mol/L (Fig. 3C). In
contrast, as reported in our earlier studies, proliferation of LTLT-Ca
cells is not stimulated by E2 (1, 27). However, when pretreated with
trastuzumab (100 Ag/mL) for 72 hours, LTLT-Ca cells exhibited a
marked stimulation of proliferation at concentrations of 10 12 to
10 7 mol/L when compared with E2 alone (P < 0.0001). In addition,
when MCF-7Ca cells were pretreated with trastuzumab,
E2-stimulated proliferation was increased at concentrations of
10 11 to 10 10 mol/L (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). The results
suggest that inhibition of Her-2 restores ERa and E2 sensitivity and
that Her-2 is a negative regulator of ER.
Pretreatment of MCF-7Ca, MCF-7, and LTLT-Ca cells with
trastuzumab for 24 hours also increased aromatase activity in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). At the same time, aromatase
protein expression was up-regulated by trastuzumab in a dosedependent manner along with ERa (Fig. 4A). Trastuzumab caused
an increase in the aromatase activity of MCF-7, suggesting that
trastuzumab influences endogenous aromatase. To investigate
whether suppressing Her-2 resulted in up-regulation of ERa and
aromatase was limited to LTLT-Ca cells, we carried out the same
experiment with ER-negative and Her-2–positive SKBr-3 cells. The
results were similar, confirming that inhibition of Her-2 results in
increased aromatase activity (Fig. 3D, inset) and ERa up-regulation

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

(data not shown). However, this effect was not seen in ER-negative
and Her-2–negative MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). Trastuzumab did not bind competitively to ERa (Fig. 4B), suggesting that
the stimulatory effects were ERa dependent, not due to intrinsic
estrogenic properties of trastuzumab. In addition, when MCF-7Ca
cells were cotreated with increasing doses of trastuzumab for
24 hours followed by 1 nmol/L E2 for 1 hour, transcriptional activity
of ERa was found to be up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner.
This increase was found to be higher than E2 (1 nmol/L) treatment
alone (Fig. 4C).
The measurement of uterine weight is a useful bioassay that
correlates with the levels of circulating estrogens in the body of the
mice. The uteri of mice bearing LTLT-Ca xenografts treated with
trastuzumab were removed and weighed at the completion of the
experiment. Trastuzumab induced a statistically significant
(P = 0.001) dose-dependent increase in uterine wet weight compared with controls (Fig. 4D). Increased uterine weight suggests
that cotreatment with trastuzumab acts to enhance ERa and
effects of E2 on the uterus. Furthermore, increased tumor
aromatase activity suggests that trastuzumab increases E2 synthesis from D4A (data not shown).
Trastuzumab is ineffective in inhibiting growth of
MCF-7Ca tumors. MCF-7Ca xenografts were grown in female
ovariectomized mice. When tumors reached measurable size
f300 mm3, mice were assigned to four groups: (a) control
(n = 5); (b) trastuzumab, 5 mg/kg/wk, divided in two doses
(n = 5); (c) letrozole, 10 Ag/d, plus trastuzumab, 5 mg/kg/wk,
divided in two doses (n = 5); and (d) letrozole, 10 Ag/d (n = 30).
The tumors were measured weekly and volume was calculated
as described in Materials and Methods. Trastuzumab did not
inhibit the growth of MCF-7Ca tumors (Fig. 5A). The growth rate

of control tumors (D4A, 100 Ag/d) was bi = 0.17 F 0.1, which was
not statistically different from that of tumors in mice treated
with trastuzumab (bi = 0.19 F 0.14) over the first 7 weeks. The
mice in both these groups (control and trastuzumab) were
sacrificed at week 7 due to large tumor volume. The tumors and
uteri of the treated mice were removed, weighed, and stored at
80jC for any additional analysis. The tumor weights (Fig. 5B) of
control (1.37 F 0.57 g) and trastuzumab (2.68 F 0.57 g) were not
statistically different (P = 0.14). However, trastuzumab treatment
alone was significantly less effective than other treatments
[versus letrozole (P = 0.0009) or versus trastuzumab plus
letrozole (P = 0.0001)].
As shown in Fig. 5C, uteri in mice treated with trastuzumab
weighed significantly more than those treated with D4A (P = 0.008).
The increase in uterine weight again suggests amplified growthstimulatory effects of E2 on cotreatment with trastuzumab.
Combination of trastuzumab plus letrozole is more effective
than either drug alone in letrozole-refractory tumors. As

shown in Fig. 5A, combination of letrozole plus trastuzumab was
effective in reducing the tumor growth rate (bi = 0.04 F 0.04 over
weeks 0–15; bi = 0.28 F 0.06 over weeks 15–27). However, the
combination was no more effective than letrozole as single agent
(bi = 0.01 F 0.02 over weeks 0–15; bi = 0.1 F 0.08 over weeks
15–27).
Letrozole inhibited the growth of these tumors for a
prolonged period (13 weeks). Nevertheless, tumors ultimately
began to grow on continued treatment and had doubled in
volume by week 15. At this time, the mice were subdivided into
three groups: (a) trastuzumab, 5 mg/kg/wk (two doses; n = 10);
(b) letrozole, 10 Ag/d, plus trastuzumab, 5 mg/kg/wk (n = 10);
and (c) letrozole, 10 Ag/d (n = 10). The experiment was
terminated on week 28. Tumors in mice switched to combination therapy following letrozole resistance responded better than
combination treatment from week 0 (P < 0.0001). This suggests
that on letrozole resistance, the addition of trastuzumab to the
treatment regimen is superior to combination therapy from the

beginning. The growth rate of these tumors was significantly
different from the tumors of mice that stayed on letrozole
treatment (P = 0.008). Tumors treated with letrozole responded
better when switched to letrozole plus trastuzumab than those
kept on letrozole. Letrozole-refractory tumors switched to
trastuzumab alone responded to the treatment only for the first
3 weeks (weeks 16–19) but then began to regrow at the rate
similar to that of the letrozole-treated mice (weeks 15–28;
P = 0.97). Thus, on resistance to letrozole, the addition of
trastuzumab was more effective than the switch to trastuzumab,
suggesting that Her-2 inhibition extends sensitivity of letrozole.
Protein expression and activity of tumors treated with
letrozole and trastuzumab alone or in combination. At
28 weeks (Fig. 5A), tumors of mice bearing MCF-7Ca xenografts
were analyzed for expression of Her-2, p-MAPK, MAPK,
aromatase, and ERa protein expression by Western blotting

(Fig. 5D). Treatment with trastuzumab increased ERa and
decreased Her-2 and p-MAPK protein expression. In contrast,
letrozole reduced ERa and increased Her-2 and p-MAPK levels.
The combination of letrozole plus trastuzumab did not affect ERa
levels and caused moderate increases in Her-2 and p-MAPK. The
tumors of mice switched from letrozole to trastuzumab showed
up-regulation of ER and down-regulation of Her-2 and p-MAPK
compared with letrozole. This would be consistent with
stimulation of growth due to release from aromatase inhibition,
allowing estrogen production. In mice treated with letrozole and
the addition of trastuzumab on tumor volume doubling, ERa
levels were moderately increased, p-MAPK was down-regulated,
and Her-2 was moderately reduced.
As shown in Fig. 6A, trastuzumab increased aromatase activity in
the tumors, whereas letrozole inhibited aromatase activity. This
increased activity was also accompanied by a 3.7-fold up-regulation

(P = 0.4, using Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s multiple comparison). C, effect of trastuzumab treatment at various doses on transactivation of ERa in MCF-7Ca cells.
The ERa transactivation assay was performed to measure transcriptional activation of ERa in MCF-7Ca cells, as described in Materials and Methods. The treatment
with trastuzumab increased ERa activation in a dose-dependent manner. The differences between E2W control and trastuzumab treatment (100, 200, 400, and
1,000 Ag/mL) were 111.31 (c, P = 0.06), 156.23 (b, P < 0.01), 279.91 (*, P < 0.001), and 305.45 (*, P < 0.001) and 0.04 for E2. When combined with 1 Amol/L

mice treated with 2, 10, and 20 mg of trastuzumab. The mean uterine wet weights ranged from 15.4 F 2.2 mg to 20.4 F 2.2 mg to 29.8 F 2.2 mg.

measure the effect of trastuzumab on transcriptional activation
of ERa in MCF-7Ca xenografts. D4A-treated control and
trastuzumab-treated tumors exhibited active transcription of
ERa, as evidenced by recruitment of histone H3 and RNA
polymerase II into the transcriptional complex (Fig. 6B).
The treatment of MCF-7Ca tumors with trastuzumab increased
recruitment of ERa to the pS2 and aromatase I.3/II promoter
(Fig. 6C). These findings support in vivo tumor volume data
and suggest that trastuzumab treatment in a hormone-sensitive
breast cancer model is agonistic via its effects on Her-2 and
hence the ER. As such, Her-2 inhibition without blockade of
estrogen signaling in the clinical setting could be detrimental.

Discussion
Although AI letrozole is more effective and tumor growth is
suppressed over an extended period compared with tamoxifen,
eventually tumors become resistant to AI therapy (1). Previous
results indicate that tumor growth is maintained by activating
Her-2/MAPK signaling pathways in letrozole-resistant LTLT-Ca
cells and letrozole-refractory tumors. In addition, ER expression
is decreased and cells become insensitive to E2, suggesting
a hormone-refractory phenotype. Our previous studies also
indicated that the combination of letrozole with MAPK inhibitor
PD98059 up-regulated ERa expression, consistent with the
reports that hyperactivation of MAPK induces loss of ERa in
breast cancer cells (1, 28). Her-2 is overexpressed in about
25% to 30% of breast cancers and correlates with poor diseasefree survival and overall survival (29, 30). With the development
of trastuzumab, effective targeted treatment of Her-2–overexpressing cancers has been possible. Treatment with trastuzumab also resulted in up-regulation of ERa. We have shown that
loss of ERa expression induced by MAPK hyperactivation is
reversible as observed in findings of others (31). Our studies
show that trastuzumab by blocking Her-2 can reverse the
suppression of ERa. To prevent development of letrozole
resistance and restore hormone sensitivity of resistant cells, we
used trastuzumab to inhibit the Her-2/MAPK pathway in the
present study.
The combination of trastuzumab with letrozole reversed
resistance to the AI and restored responsiveness of the tumors.
However, this effect was limited to letrozole-refractory and Her-2–
overexpressing cells and tumors. Trastuzumab alone was only
effective for a brief period of 4 weeks in letrozole-refractory tumors.
In the tumors with low Her-2 levels, the letrozole plus trastuzumab
combination was no more effective than letrozole single agent.
However, in Her-2–overexpressing tumors, trastuzumab plus
letrozole was far superior in inhibiting tumor growth compared
with either single agent (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that
trastuzumab restores sensitivity of LTLT-Ca cells to letrozole by
inhibiting Her-2 and up-regulation of ERa. As such, blockade of the
ERa pathway remains an essential component of tumor and cell
growth inhibition. Up-regulation of intratumoral aromatase was
also seen with trastuzumab treatment to make the cells more
responsive to AIs.
In our current study, we have shown that inhibition of Her-2
with trastuzumab results in activation of ERa-mediated signaling
pathway. Based on these data, we hypothesize that an inverse
and compensatory relationship exists between Her-2 and ERa
and inhibition of one pathway leads to activation of the other.

www.aacrjournals.org

Several reports have suggested that translocation of ERa to the
membrane may be responsible for the cross-talk with EGFR
family members in endocrine-resistant phenotype (32–34),
whereas a few reports have also suggested that EGFR family
transmembrane receptors such as Her-2 can translocate to the
nucleus and act as transcription factors (35–38).
Studies performed in trastuzumab-resistant variants of breast
cancer cell lines have indicated up-regulation of transforming
growth factor a (TGFa) and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; refs. 39, 40). Interestingly, both VEGF and TGFa are
estrogen-responsive genes (41). These data are consistent
with our results and suggest that Her-2 suppresses ERa, as
resistance to trastuzumab is associated with up-regulation of
ERa-responsive genes (39, 40). Our studies show that trastuzumab alone was not an effective treatment strategy in this model
and the data suggest that it is likely to be due to up-regulation
of intratumoral aromatase and ERa. To distinguish whether
up-regulation of ERa was a result of increased protein synthesis
or reduced degradation, cells were treated with trastuzumab in
the presence or absence of cycloheximide (translational inhibitor). Western immunoblotting analysis revealed that trastuzumab
treatment increased ERa to a greater extent in the absence of
cycloheximide, suggesting that trastuzumab modulates protein
synthesis. However, even in the presence of cycloheximide, ERa
protein was up-regulated by trastuzumab treatment, suggesting
that trastuzumab treatment affects protein degradation as well
(data not shown). In addition, RT-PCR analysis revealed that
ERa mRNA expression is increased with trastuzumab treatment
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D).
In agreement with our findings, clinical studies have shown
that trastuzumab as single agent has promising effects in firstline treatment of f40% breast cancer patients (42). However,
the median duration of response is only f8 months. Furthermore, intrinsic or de novo resistance to trastuzumab in Her-2–
overexpressing breast cancers has been reported. As the use of
trastuzumab is now extended to adjuvant treatment of breast
cancer, it is important to assess the molecular effects of
trastuzumab on Her-2–overexpressing breast cancer cells and
determine appropriate strategies for optimal treatment. Our
studies clearly show the importance of inhibiting both estrogen
signaling by AI letrozole and the growth factor receptor Her-2
pathway in overcoming resistance to therapy. However, if used
for treatment of hormone-responsive tumors, trastuzumab may
amplify estrogen signaling and stimulate tumor growth. The
results indicate that inhibition of Her-2 via trastuzumab can
restore the responsiveness of tumors to letrozole and trastuzumab, thus extending the use of AIs and delaying the need for
chemotherapy.
