Abstract
MET ampliﬁcation as a mechanism of acquired resistance to EGF receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies in non–
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) led to investigation of novel combinations of EGFR and MET kinase inhibitors.
However, promiscuous interactions between MET and ERBB family members have made it difﬁcult to evaluate
the effects of MET on EGFR signaling, both independent of drug treatment and in the context of drug resistance.
We addressed this issue by establishing a 32D model cell system wherein ERBBs or MET are expressed alone and
in combination. Using this model, we determined that EGFR signaling is sufﬁcient to induce MET phosphorylation, although MET activation is enhanced by coexpression of ERBB3. EGFR–MET cross-talk was not direct,
but occurred by a combined regulation of MET levels and intermediary signaling through mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK). In NSCLCs harboring either wild-type or mutant EGFR, inhibiting EGFR or MAPK
reduced MET activation and protein levels. Furthermore, MET signaling promoted EGFR-driven migration and
invasion. Finally, EGFR–MET signaling was enhanced in a highly metastatic EGFR-mutant cell subpopulation,
compared with the indolent parental line, and MET attenuation decreased the incidence of brain metastasis.
Overall, our results establish that EGFR–MET signaling is critical for aggressive behavior of NSCLCs and
rationalize its continued investigation as a therapeutic target for tumors harboring both wild-type and mutant
EGFR at early stages of progression. Cancer Res; 73(16); 5053–65. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Activating mutations in EGF receptor (EGFR) are commonly
found in non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and cells
expressing mutant alleles depend on EGFR signaling for survival. Drugs targeting the EGFR kinase domain are effective for
NSCLCs; unfortunately, responding tumors eventually progress owing to acquired resistance. Mechanisms of resistance to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) include secondary mutations in EGFR and activation of compensatory receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), such as MET. In 5% to 20% of recurrent
patients, MET activation sustains tumor cell survival and is
associated with relapse (1–4). Accordingly, EGFR and MET
combination therapies are in clinical trials for patients harboring MET ampliﬁcation and resistance to EGFR TKIs (5).
Bidirectional signaling between EGFR and MET occurs in
both EGFR TKI-resistant and drug-na€ve NSCLC cells. Notably,
in NSCLC cells addicted to EGFR mutations, EGFR inhibition

reduces basal MET phosphorylation (6–8). Conversely, MET
inhibition in cells with high basal MET activity or MET ampliﬁcation reduces basal phosphorylation of EGFR and ERBB
family members, ERBB2 and ERBB3 (1, 2, 9, 10). In METampliﬁed cells, MET signaling through ERBB3 maintains
PI3K/Akt cell survival signaling despite EGFR inhibition (1).
In addition, in NSCLC with wild-type EGFR or EGFR TKI
resistance mutations, ligand stimulation of EGFR induces MET
activation, and vice versa (8, 11, 12).
Mechanisms and outcomes of these biochemical events are
difﬁcult to interpret owing to the complexity of inter-ERBB
interactions, which may involve promiscuous ERBB heterodimerization or indirect signaling cascades. Proposed mechanisms of ERBB–MET cross-talk include direct interaction, activation through autocrine regulation, and signaling through
intermediary proteins (12, 13). Moreover, receptor cross-talk in
some cells may not be bidirectional, but rather unilateral from
EGFR to MET (14). In cancer cells encoding wild-type EGFR,
MET regulates invasion and cell motility in an EGF-dependent
manner (8, 12). Signiﬁcantly, it is unknown if EGFR–MET
cross-talk in lung cancers with EGFR mutations modulates
similar phenotypes, particularly in patients with advanced
disease and metastatic relapse. Deﬁning the speciﬁc biologic
contexts of ERBB–MET cross-talk, identifying their mechanisms of action, and characterizing their function may help
expand clinical settings where combinatorial EGFR-MET therapies would beneﬁt patients with NSCLC.

Breindel et al.

To systematically examine ERBB–MET cross-talk, we used a
cellular system enabling analysis of functional interactions
between individual ERBBs and MET in isolation or combination. We found that EGFR is sufﬁcient to stabilize and crossactivate MET in the absence of other ERBBs. Activation is
indirect, involving MEK/p38MAPK signaling, and is enhanced
by ERBB3. This EGFR–MET axis is also active in NSCLC cells,
where MET facilitates EGF-induced migration and invasion
irrespective of EGFR mutational status. Finally, EGFR–MET
activation is enhanced in an experimental model of metastatic
NSCLC cells and potentiates brain metastasis.

Materials and Methods

(ATCC)] were grown in RPMI with 10% heat-inactivated FBS
and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (CM). WEHI-3B
(ATCC) cells were grown in RPMI with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS. For WEHI-CM, WEHI-3B cells were grown in RPMI with
1% FBS for 4 days, medium was collected, and passed through a
0.22 mm ﬁlter. A549, H441, H2030, H1650, HCC827, H1975 cells
(ATCC), PC9, and PC9-BrM3 cells (15) were grown in RPMI
with 10% FBS. SYF/ mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF;
ref. 16) were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium with
10% FBS. All media contained 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
L-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate.
Cloning
Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted with QuikChange
Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies)
following the manufacturer's protocol. Primers were designed
using the manufacturer's guidelines and obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. The pRK5TKneo-MET-V5/His
(Genentech) plasmid was used to make pRK5TKneo-METK1110A-V5/His, pRK5TKneo-MET-Y1234/1235F-V5/His, and
pRK5TKneo-MET-Y1349/1354F-V5/His.

Cells were selected and then maintained at 2 and 1 mg/mL
puromycin (R&D Systems) or 100 and 50 mg/mL G418, respectively (GIBCO).
Control and MET knockdown lentivirus was produced
by cotransfecting HEK 293T cells with pLKO-shRNA constructs (Sigma-Aldrich), pMD2.G, and psPAX2 (Addgene)
using lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Supernatants were collected daily for 3 days, combined, and concentrated with
Centricon plus-20 ﬁlters (Millipore Corporation). Cells were
infected overnight in 4 mg/mL polybrene, selected and
maintained at 2 and 1 mg/mL puromycin, respectively.

maintained and cells migrated overnight from 0.1% FBS
toward 10% FBS. Cells were stained and cell number was
averaged from three ﬁelds of view per chamber. Invasion assays
were conducted similarly but with 1.4  105 cells per well in
Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences). For growth

PBS. Cells were rinsed 30 minutes in PBS and air-dried. Colonies
were counted using scanned images with ImageJ software.
In vivo metastasis assay
Animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the
Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. A total of
2.5  104 cells were suspended in 0.1 mL PBS and injected into
the right ventricle of 6-week-old nude athymic mice. Metastasis was detected by bioluminescence with an IVIS Spectrum
(Perkin Elmer) as previously described (17). Tumor incidence
was quantiﬁed by luminescent signal in limbs, spine, or brain
in whole body images at given time points and presented
as Kaplan–Meier curves. P values were calculated by log-rank
test. When possible, animals were sacriﬁced for harvest of
tissues to conﬁrm metastasis by quantifying organ-speciﬁc
luminescence.

Results
Signaling through EGFR leads to delayed activation of
MET
Discrepancies in ERBB–MET interactions among NSCLC
cell lines arise from underlying differences in ERBB mutational
status and relative expression levels. Because ERBBs crossactivate, it was uncertain which individual ERBB(s) interact
with MET or if intermediary signaling pathways indirectly
integrate MET with ERBB signaling. To distinguish these
possibilities, we used 32D cells that lack ERBBs and MET.
Because epithelial cell lines express one or more ERBBs, use of
murine hematopoietic 32D cells has been invaluable for elucidating ERBB interactions in reconstruction experiments (18,
19). RT-PCR veriﬁed that 32D cells are devoid of EGFR, ERBB2,
ERBB3, ERBB4, MET, and agonists EGF, TGF-a, AREG, BTC,
NRG1, and HGF, consistent with previous studies (data not
shown; refs. 18, 19). We then ectopically expressed EGFR and
MET alone or in combination (Fig. 1A).
In 32D cells that are engineered to express human EGFR or
MET singly, EGF stimulated EGFR phosphorylation and HGF
stimulated MET phosphorylation, as expected (Supplementary Fig. S1A). EGF did not induce MET phosphorylation and
HGF did not induce EGFR phosphorylation, verifying speciﬁcity of ligands for their receptors (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
In cells expressing both EGFR and MET (EGFR/MET), HGF
failed to induce phosphorylation of EGFR at Y1068 (Supplementary Fig. S1B), however, EGF increased MET phosphor-

ylation and protein levels (Fig. 1B). Although EGF induces
rapid phosphorylation of EGFR, EGF-induced phosphorylation of MET was delayed, occurring after 2 hours and increasing through 10 hours (Fig. 1B). EGF stimulation induced
an increase in total MET levels without affecting the abundance of MET mRNA (Fig. 1C). Also, quantiﬁcation of phospho-MET to total MET revealed increased stoichiometry of
MET phosphorylation induced by EGF (Fig. 1D). Overall,
EGFR upregulates MET abundance and relative Tyr phosphorylation over an extended time frame, and does not
require other ERBB family receptors.
EGFR and MET kinases are required for EGF-dependent
activation of MET
EGF-induced MET phosphorylation could occur through
direct phosphorylation of MET by EGFR, EGF-dependent
activation of MET autophosphorylation, or another intermediary kinase. To investigate the importance of kinase activity in
this receptor interaction, small-molecule TKIs geﬁtinib and
PHA665752 were used to inhibit EGFR and MET, respectively.
Speciﬁcity of inhibitors for the cognate receptors was veriﬁed
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Although slight changes in
phospho-EGFR were seen with single inhibitors, these changes
reﬂected similar differences in total protein level and were not
seen consistently (Fig. 1E). Treatment of EGFR/MET 32D cells
with geﬁtinib prevents EGF-induced MET phosphorylation,
while PHA665752 completely abolishes both EGF-induced and
basal phosphorylation of MET (Fig. 1E). Similarly, EGF was
unable to induce robust phosphorylation of kinase-inactive
MET mutants K1110A and Y1234F/Y1235F, while still activating wild-type MET receptor and docking site-mutant Y1349F/
Y1354F (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Hence, EGF-induced MET
phosphorylation in 32D cells requires activity of both EGFR
and MET kinases.
Enhanced MET signaling is one mechanism by which
NSCLC patients with EGFR-activating mutations, such as
EGFR L858R, become resistant to therapy with the EGFR
inhibitor erlotinib (2–4). Recent evidence suggests that MET
and activated EGFR also interact in drug-na€ve lung cancer
cells independent of drug-resistance mechanisms (6–9, 12). To
determine if activated EGFR alleles commonly found in NSCLC
activate MET, MET was expressed in 32D cells in combination
with EGFR L858R. Similar to wild-type EGFR, EGFR L858R
induced MET phosphorylation after 4 hours of EGF stimulation, and activation was prevented by geﬁtinib (Fig. 1F). These
results show for the ﬁrst time that EGFR activates MET
independent of other ERBB family members, and that both
wild-type and activated EGFR induce MET phosphorylation.
ERBB3 enhances EGFR-induced MET phosphorylation
ERBB3 is nearly devoid of intrinsic catalytic activity, and
functions through heteromers with other ERBBs (20, 21).
Although ERBB3 phosphorylation can be dependent on MET
in geﬁtinib-resistant NSCLC cells, it is unclear whether ERBB3
and MET interact in drug-na€ve cells or if another ERBB
family member is required (1). To investigate signaling interactions between ERBB3 and MET, ERBB3 was coexpressed
with MET alone or with EGFR/MET in 32D cells. Coexpression

of ERBB3 enhanced EGF-induced MET phosphorylation compared with EGFR/MET alone (Fig. 2A). Similar to EGFR/MET
cells, stimulation of EGFR/ERBB3/MET cells with ERBB
ligands did not affect MET mRNA levels (Fig. 2B). Increased
EGF-dependent phospho-MET relative to total MET occurs
within 4 hours in EGFR/ERBB3/MET cells and is maximal by
7 hours (Fig. 2C). Hence, ERBB3 enhances EGF-induced
MET phosphorylation, likely through signal ampliﬁcation and
broadening by EGFR/ERBB3 heteromers. In fact, coexpression
of EGFR and ERBB3 alters EGF-induced downstream signaling, leading to decreased phospho-Akt, increased phosphoErk, and possibly increased total extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk; Fig. 2D).
Having determined that ERBB3 alters signaling to MET by
EGFR, we investigated whether MET can be activated by
ERBB3 alone. Stimulation of ERBB3/MET cells with the ERBB3
ligand NRG1 for up to 10 hours failed to activate MET or Akt
(Fig. 2E). Lack of ERBB3/MET signaling activity suggests that
these receptors cannot act as direct dimerization partners.
However, when EGFR is coexpressed in ERBB3/MET cells, NRG
induces MET phosphorylation (Fig. 2E), indicating that ERBB3
can induce MET phosphorylation when it has a catalytically
active signaling partner. Therefore, MET cannot act as a
functional dimerization partner for ERBB3, but ligand-activated ERBB3 is able to induce MET phosphorylation when coexpressed with EGFR.

EGFR activates MET through protein stability and MAPK
signaling in 32D cells
EGFR may activate MET through increased autocrine MET
signaling by increasing transcription or stability of MET or
HGF. EGF-induced MET activation is actinomycin D–sensitive
and thus requires transcription (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
However, MET activation was not associated with changes in
MET mRNA levels (Fig. 1C) and HGF mRNA was not expressed
(data not shown). Therefore, transcriptional dependency in
32D cells involves another component of the pathway.
The changes observed in MET levels without an increase in
MET mRNA suggest instead that EGFR stabilizes MET protein.
32D cells expressing MET or EGFR/MET were treated with
the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and the half-life
of MET protein was evaluated. EGF failed to stabilize MET in
cells expressing MET alone, as expected (Fig. 3A). However,
MET was stabilized by coexpression of EGFR and further
stabilized when EGFR was activated by EGF (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of EGFR increased the MET half-life from 3.5 to
5.5 hours, whereas EGF-stimulation of EGFR further increased
the half-life to 6.3 hours (Fig. 3B). It is likely that the increase
in MET half-life by EGFR expression is caused by basal EGFR
activity from high expression levels. Overall, MET protein is
stabilized by EGFR signaling in 32D cells.
In addition to regulating MET protein stability, it is
possible that EGFR activates MET through signaling proteins

line, 201T (12). To determine if this is a general mechanism
of EGFR-induced MET phosphorylation, Src inhibitors were
evaluated for the ability to prevent EGFR–MET cross-talk in

family proteins are not absolutely required for EGF-induced
MET phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Thus,
although Src is involved in EGFR-induced MET activation
in some contexts, it is not a unique mediator of and is not
required for EGFR–MET cross-talk.
To identify intermediaries in EGF-induced MET phosphorylation in 32D cells, pools of protein kinase inhibitors were
tested for interference with this process (Supplementary Fig.
S3C). Of these, inhibitor pools A, C, and D prevented EGFinduced MET phosphorylation. Pool C yielded inconsistent
results among experiments, and only partially inhibited Met
phosphorylation. Pool A includes at least one agent,
BMS754807, which is now reported to have some inhibitory
activity on MET. For these reasons, we focused on pool D,
composed of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling inhibitors.
To evaluate the role of MAPK in EGFR-MET signaling, inhibitors of MEK1/2 and p38MAPK, U0126 and
SB203580, were tested for ability to prevent EGFR-MET
crosstalk. These inhibitors had moderate or no effect on

EGF-induced MET phosphorylation singly, but nearly
completely prevent it when combined (Fig. 3D). This suggests that EGF-induced MET phosphorylation works
through the RAS–ERK–p38MAPK pathway, and compensation occurs through parallel MAPK cascades when only one
is inhibited.
Although geﬁtinib inhibits EGF-induced MET phosphorylation in cells with wild-type EGFR or EGFR L858R (Fig. 1E
and F), it is ineffective against the resistance mutation,
T790M. To determine if MEK and p38MAPK inhibitors
prevent EGFR activation of MET in cells with T790M mutations, EGFR L858R/T790M (LT) receptors were coexpressed
with MET in 32D cells. Geﬁtinib did not affect EGFR or MET
phosphorylation in these cells, but the combination of
U0126/SB203580 substantially decreased MET phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). Hence, MEK/p38MAPK inhibitors can inhibit
EGFR–MET signaling in cells where geﬁtinib is not effective.
Overall, EGFR activation of MET in 32D cells occurs through

EGFR–MET Signaling in NSCLC Metastasis

EGFR regulates MET at multiple levels in NSCLC cell lines
To conﬁrm the presence of EGFR–MET cross-talk in NSCLC
cell lines, the EGFR-mutant cell line, HCC827, was treated with
geﬁtinib for up to 24 hours. Geﬁtinib treatment induced rapid
decreases in MET phosphorylation and delayed decreases in
MET protein levels (Fig. 4A). These different rates of change
suggest that EGFR can affect MET phosphorylation independent of MET protein levels. Unlike 32D cells, EGFR signaling in
HCC827 cells regulates MET protein and MET mRNA with
similar kinetics following geﬁtinib treatment (Fig. 4B and C),
emphasizing the complex dynamics of EGFR–MET signaling in
NSCLC cell lines. Similar changes in MET phosphorylation,
protein, and mRNA were observed following geﬁtinib treatment of another EGFR-mutant cell line, PC9 (Supplementary
Fig. S4).
Although changes in MET protein levels following geﬁtinib
treatment may be caused by decreased mRNA abundance,
there is evidence for EGFR-dependent modulation of MET at
the protein level through MET ubiquitination. Following stimulation by HGF, MET is ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase, c-CBL,
and internalized for intracellular trafﬁcking or degradation
(22–25). Although three cell lines with wild-type EGFR underwent robust MET ubiquitination following ligand stimulation,
three of four cell lines with EGFR-activating mutations did not
(Fig. 4D). Importantly, MET ubiquitination was associated with
phosphorylation of c-CBL (Fig. 4D). This corroborates our
ﬁnding that, in 32D cells, EGFR stabilizes MET protein levels

independent of transcriptional changes and indicates that
EGFR modulates MET at multiple levels in NSCLC cell lines.
To determine if intermediary signaling cross-talk occurs
through MAPK in NSCLC cell lines, HCC827 cells were treated
with U0126/SB203580. Interestingly, treatment with either
geﬁtinib or U0126/SB203580 caused a reduction in total MET
levels, accompanied by elimination of phospho-MET (Fig. 4E).
This conﬁrms that signaling observed in 32D cells resembles
NSCLC cell lines and that MEK/p38MAPK pathways act as
signaling intermediaries between EGFR and MET in multiple
cell types. Although NSCLC cells display a more complicated
relationship between EGFR and MET than 32D cells, NSCLC
cells similarly show independent regulation of MET protein
and phosphorylation by EGFR signaling. Importantly, the
existence of EGFR–MET cross-talk in multiple NSCLC cell
lines indicates that EGFR-induced MET activation may have
a biologic signiﬁcance.
MET regulates EGFR-induced migration and invasion in
NSCLC cells
MET regulates many cellular phenotypes, including cell
growth and motility. We compared EGFR-only with EGFR/
MET 32D cells and found that EGFR–MET cross-talk had no
effect on cell viability (data not shown). Because MET signaling
is also important for cell motility, it is possible that EGFR
activation of MET modulates this phenotype. MET is required
for EGF-induced cell invasion and motility in EGFR wild-type

NSCLC cells but it was unclear if this is true in cells with EGFRactivating mutations (12). Hence, we conﬁrmed the previously
reported MET-dependence for EGF-induced migration and
invasion in the EGFR wild-type NSCLC cell line A549 (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and tested additional cell lines with various
EGFR mutations. Indeed, PHA665752 prevented EGF-induced
migration of NSCLC cell lines with both wild-type and activated EGFR (Fig. 5A). Similarly, MET inhibition prevented
EGF-induced invasion through Matrigel of both EGFR wildtype and mutant NSCLC cells (Fig. 5B). This was conﬁrmed
with an additional highly speciﬁc MET inhibitor, PF-04217903,
which has strong activity in NSCLC cells (Supplementary Fig.
S5B and S5C). Therefore, EGFR–MET signaling is active in
NSCLC cell lines with multiple EGFR-activating mutations and
mediates aggressive phenotypes including migration and
invasion.
EGFR–MET signaling is important for metastatic
behavior
MET promotes EGF-induced NSCLC cell invasion, so it may
have a role in the biology of metastatic lung cancer cells
addicted to EGFR. To investigate this, we compared EGFR–
MET signaling in an EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell line, PC9, and its
metastatic subpopulation, PC9-BrM3 (15, 26, 27). Both parental
PC9 and PC9-BrM3 cell lines harbor constitutively active EGFR
D746–750 and are dependent on EGFR signaling for survival.
However, PC9-BrM3 cells have a marked increase in the
capacity to invade and colonize distant organs, most notably
the brain (15).
EGFR inhibition in both PC9 and PC9-BrM3 cells decreases
MET phosphorylation and protein levels, conﬁrming the presence of EGFR–MET signaling in these cells (Fig. 6A). However,

5060

Cancer Res; 73(16) August 15, 2013

the mechanism of EGFR–MET signaling differs, as MEK/
p38MAPK inhibition reduces MET phosphorylation and protein levels in PC9-BrM3 cells, but has little effect on PC9 cells
(Fig. 6A). Different requirements for MAPK in EGFR–MET
signaling may correlate with lower Erk phosphorylation
observed in PC9 compared with PC9-BrM3 cells (Fig. 6B). In
addition, mRNA levels of both EGFR and MET trended higher in
PC9-BrM3 than PC9 cells (Fig. 6C). Although possibly coincidental, these differences in EGFR–MET signaling raised the
possibility that this pathway contributes to the highly metastatic behavior of PC9-BrM3 cells.
To directly evaluate the role of MET in EGFR-driven phenotypes of PC9 and PC9-BrM3 cells, a lentiviral system was
used to induce MET knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S6A).
Similar to growth studies in 32D cells, MET knockdown did not
affect growth of PC9 or PC9-BrM3 cells (Fig. 6D). In contrast
with other NCSLC cells, MET was not required for EGFinduced cell invasion of parental PC9 cells and knockdown
inconsistently affected cell migration (Fig. 6E). Interestingly,
MET knockdown prevented both EGF-induced cell migration
and invasion in PC9-BrM3 cells (Fig. 6E). This was conﬁrmed
with PHA665752 treatment, showing consistent cellular
responses to MET inhibition and knockdown (Supplementary
Fig. S6B). The role of MET in clonogenic potential also differed
between the cell lines. MET knockdown with two different
short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) yielded inconsistent changes in
clonogenic colony formation of PC9 cells, suggesting these
effects were not MET speciﬁc (Fig. 6F). However, knockdown of
MET in PC9-BrM3 cells consistently reduced clonogenic colony formation (Fig. 6F). Although EGFR–MET cross-talk exists
in parental PC9 cells, the functional consequence of EGFR–
MET cross-talk is different in metastatic cells where it

enhances clonogenicity and invasion, independently of cell
survival. Thus, although NSCLC cells generally require mutant
EGFR signaling for tumorigenesis, cross-talk with MET may
further enhance metastatic progression.
MET signaling modulates metastasis in many epithelial
cancers (28–31). In patients with NSCLC, MET expression and
phosphorylation correlate with the incidence of brain metastasis, but the functions of MET in lung cancer metastasis
remain uncharacterized (32). A rate-limiting step in metastasis
is invasion and colonization of distant organs by cancer
cells following dissemination into the bloodstream (33). To

and burden of metastasis were compared following intracardiac injection of PC9-BrM3 cells stably expressing control or

was seen in overall tumor burden between control and MET
knockdown (Fig. 7A). Although MET knockdown had no effect
on bone metastasis, incidence of brain metastasis was signiﬁcantly delayed and/or attenuated (Fig. 7B and C). When

brain imaging. Although there was no signiﬁcant difference in
the brain tumor burden in animals that harbor metastasis at
endpoint, MET knockdown decreased the frequency of brain
metastasis from 100% to 30% (Fig. 7B). This corroborates in
vitro results of MET knockdown decreasing cell invasion but
not growth (Fig. 6). In summary, MET signaling enhances in vivo
brain metastatic invasion by EGFR-addicted NSCLC cells. This
supports the clinical correlation observed between MET
expression and metastatic relapse in patients with NSCLC, and
emphasizes the signiﬁcance of EGFR–MET signaling in aggressive stages of lung cancer progression (32).

Discussion
Existence of signaling interactions between MET and the
ERBBs is well established, but mechanism(s) are incompletely
understood. For reconstruction of deﬁned sets of receptors, it
was essential to use a receptor-null cell background, which was
not possible for epithelial lines as they express one or more
ERBBs. We used murine 32D cells, which do not express
endogenous MET or any ERBBs, to investigate interactions
between MET and individual ERBBs. EGFR signaling was
sufﬁcient to induce MET phosphorylation and increase MET
protein levels, but MET activation was augmented by coexpression of ERBB3. Rather than direct cross-phosphorylation,
EGFR activation of MET occurs through combined stabilization of MET protein and intermediary signaling through
MAPK. EGFR–MET cross-talk in lung cancer cells is more
complex, and involves multiple levels of regulation including
RNA, protein, and phosphorylation. Signiﬁcantly, in lung carcinoma, EGFR–MET signaling is exaggerated in metastatic
cells where MET enhances EGFR-mediated aggressive pheno-

types including migration, invasion, and metastasis, independently of cell growth.
EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB3 have all been implicated in
ERBB–MET signaling cross-talk. However, promiscuous
ERBB dimerization and coexpression of multiple ERBBs in
NSCLC cells makes it difﬁcult to determine which ERBB(s)
activate MET. Using a model system, we determined that
EGFR activation by ligand or mutation is sufﬁcient to induce
MET phosphorylation (Fig. 1). Although we did not observe
activation of EGFR by MET, only one EGFR phosphorylation
site was tested and we cannot rule out such cross-talk
entirely. In addition, ERBB3 enhances EGFR-driven phosphorylation of MET and activates MET itself when part of an
active dimer (Fig. 2). Consequently, MET activation may
occur in NSCLC tumors with active EGFR but could be
enhanced in tumors coexpressing other ERBB receptors. In
addition to enhancing EGFR-induced MET activation,
ERBB3 alters downstream signaling of EGFR through MAPK
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (Fig. 2).
Therefore, coexpression of ERBB3 in NSCLC may affect not
only ERBB–MET cross-talk but intracellular signaling as
well.
Multiple different mechanisms may regulate EGFR activation of MET including direct receptor interactions, regulation
of MET autocrine signaling, or indirect signaling through
intermediary proteins. We have excluded direct receptor
cross-phosphorylation based on delayed EGF-induced MET
phosphorylation, requirement for both EGFR and MET kinase
activities, and the inability of MET to act as a dimerization
partner for ERBB3 (Figs. 1 and 2). Instead, we see evidence for
ERBB regulation of MET through both autocrine and intermediary signaling.

EGFR–MET Signaling in NSCLC Metastasis

In some cell lines, EGFR activates MET by inducing MET
transcription, thereby increasing the concentration of MET at
the membrane, leading to more receptor collisions, homodimer formation, and MET activation (12, 34, 35). In our model
system, EGFR regulates MET at the protein level by extending
the MET half-life (Fig. 3), which would also increase MET
availability and enhance autocrine activation. In papillary renal
carcinoma, MET mutations lead to increased recycling and
decreased degradation, causing increased activation of MET
that drives tumorigenesis (36). We see decreased MET ubiquitination in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells, which would similarly
alter MET recycling and degradation (Fig. 4). Therefore, active
EGFR in NSCLC tumors may regulate MET through altered
receptor trafﬁcking to enhance already robust tumorigenic
signaling.
Dulak and colleagues reported that Src is required for EGFRinduced MET activation independent of MET transcription,
indicating MET can also be regulated through intermediary
signaling pathways (12). We found that MAPK signaling correlated with higher ERBB-driven MET phosphorylation and
was required for EGFR-dependent MET activation in cells with
both wild-type and mutant EGFR (Figs. 3 and 4). Different
requirements for Src and MAPK signaling may depend on the
cell line, and it is possible that both pathways act as intermediates in different contexts. In addition, Src can enhance
activation of MAPK in cancer cells directly or by binding to
EGFR, so these pathways may have additive functions (37).
Investigation of additional experimental models and tumor
samples could reveal the relative roles of these proteins in
EGFR–MET cross-talk in different cell types and contexts.
Existence of EGFR–MET signaling in multiple normal and
cancer cell lines suggests that MET modulates biologic outcomes of EGFR signaling. Although both receptors activate
PI3K/Akt signaling, MET was not required for cell survival in
32D or NSCLC cells. EGFR and MET also commonly regulate
cell motility and MET promotes EGF-induced cell motility and
invasion in EGFR wild-type NSCLC cells (8, 12). NSCLC cells
with EGFR mutations have constitutively hyperactive EGFR
signaling and it was unclear if MET could regulate EGFR-driven
phenotypes in these cells. We found, however, that MET
facilitates EGF-induced migration and invasion in EGFRmutant NSCLC cells (Fig. 5), showing that MET signaling
enhances other aggressive phenotypes of EGFR-mutant lung
cancers.
Moreover, we discovered differences in EGFR–MET crosstalk in NSCLC cell lines of varying metastatic potential. In
metastatic PC9-BrM3 derivatives, but not parental PC9 cells,
EGFR–MET signaling enhanced migration, invasion, and colony formation, and was dependent on MAPK signaling (Fig. 6).
Differences between PC9 and PC9-BrM3 cells reveal contextdependent requirements for EGFR–MET signaling in metastatic NSCLC cells. Because PC9-BrM3 cells were selected
to be highly metastatic in vivo, enhanced signaling in these
cells suggests EGFR–MET cross-talk could be a mediator of
metastasis and that the mechanism of cross-talk can change
throughout progression.

carcinomas, and breast cancer and MET expression and activ-

ity in NSCLC correlate with occurrence of brain metastasis
(29, 32, 38, 39). In addition, MET copy number, expression, and
phosphorylation are enriched in NSCLC brain metastases
compared with primary tumors (32). Despite association of
MET with metastasis, a direct role for MET in metastasis of
NSCLC has not been previously identiﬁed. We observed that
MET knockdown in highly metastatic NSCLC PC9-BrM3 cells
caused signiﬁcant reduction in metastasis to the brain (Fig. 7).
Differences between brain and other organ sites may depend
on the brain being a more stringent organ to invade, which is
supported by delayed detection of brain metastasis versus
other sites in our model. In addition, differences in brain tumor
incidence but not burden suggest that an important role of
MET in lung cancer metastasis may be to promote invasion of
the brain environment. The signiﬁcance of this result is underscored by the fact that the brain is the major metastatic site and
source of morbidity in patients with lung cancer (40). The
inability of mouse HGF to activate human MET makes it
difﬁcult to address the relative contributions of EGFR–MET
cross-talk versus HGF paracrine MET activation toward
metastasis with this model, but does not detract from the
importance of MET in promoting NSCLC progression. These
results support further investigation of the role of MET in
EGFR-mutant NSCLC brain metastasis and the use of MET
inhibitors to prevent metastatic progression of NSCLC in
patients.
Previous clinical trials for MET inhibitors in NSCLC were
focused on patients who were resistant to EGFR TKIs due to
MET ampliﬁcation. The ability of both wild-type and mutant
EGFR to activate MET, as well as MET regulation of EGFRdriven migration, invasion, and metastasis, suggests that MET
inhibitors may be beneﬁcial to patients with varying mutational status. In fact, a recent clinical trial of combination
EGFR-MET inhibitors that did not prescreen patients for
mutation status found increased progression free and overall
survival in patients with wild-type EGFR NSCLC (41). In
addition, EGFR–MET signaling becomes more important at
later stages of NSCLC progression, indicating that use of MET
inhibitors in patients with early-stage cancer may prevent
occurrence of invasion and metastasis and should be evaluated
as a therapeutic option. Further investigation of EGFR–MET
cross-talk will be useful for determining which patients
may beneﬁt most from combination therapies and for identifying potential new targets to prevent EGFR-induced MET
activation.
