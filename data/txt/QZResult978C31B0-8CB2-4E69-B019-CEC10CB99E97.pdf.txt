SUMMARY
Cancer is driven by mutation. Worldwide, tobacco smoking is the major lifestyle exposure that
causes cancer, exerting carcinogenicity through >60 chemicals that bind and mutate DNA. Using
massively parallel sequencing technology, we sequenced a small cell lung cancer cell line, NCIH209, to explore the mutational burden associated with tobacco smoking. 22,910 somatic
substitutions were identified, including 132 in coding exons. Multiple mutation signatures testify
to the cocktail of carcinogens in tobacco smoke and their proclivities for particular bases and
surrounding sequence context. Effects of transcription-coupled repair and a second, more general

exons 3-8 of CHD7 in-frame, and another two lines carrying PVT1-CHD7 fusion genes,
suggesting that CHD7 may be recurrently rearranged in this disease. These findings illustrate the
potential for next-generation sequencing to provide unprecedented insights into mutational
processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with cancer.

INTRODUCTION
More than 1 billion people worldwide smoke tobacco1. With 20x greater risk of developing
lung cancer than non-smokers and increased risk of many other tumour types, a smoker's
lifestyle choice represents the most significant carcinogenic exposure confronting health
services today. Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 mutagens that bind and chemically
modify DNA2,3, and these brand the lung cancer genome with characteristic mutational
patterns. Point mutations in, for example, TP53 and KRAS show different signatures
between smokers and non-smokers with lung cancer2-4. However, such studies have been
limited to a few genes, and it is unclear how representative these findings are of mutational
processes across the whole genome5. In vitro assays and mouse models have been important
tools for testing the mutagenicity of individual chemical constituents of tobacco smoke, but
are of limited value for generalising to the complexity of smoking behaviours, systemic
metabolism and cancer development in humans. Massively parallel sequencing technologies
promise the capacity to paint a genome-wide portrait of mutation in human cancer. Such
data will provide unprecedented insights into the relative contributions of different tobacco
carcinogens to mutation in vivo, the effects of local DNA structure on mutability and the
cellular defence mechanisms against exogenous mutagens.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, developing in more
than a million new patients annually6. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), representing 15% of
cases, is a distinct subtype associated with a typical clinical picture of early metastasis,
initial response to chemotherapy but subsequent relapse, and a 2-year survival of <15%7.
Several tumour suppressor genes are inactivated, including TP53 (80-90% of cases8), RB1
(60-90% of cases9,10) and PTEN (13% of cases11). Infrequent activating mutations have
been found in PIK3CA, EGFR and KRAS (all 10% or lower; http://www.sanger.ac.uk/
genetics/CGP/cosmic/), and MYC is amplified in 20% of cases.
The development of massively parallel sequencing technologies makes it feasible to
catalogue all classes of somatically acquired mutation in a cancer, including base
substitutions12,13, insertions and deletions (indels)12,13, copy number changes14 and
genomic rearrangements14. Reports from high-coverage sequencing of two acute myeloid
leukaemia genomes have been published, which have concentrated on detecting point
mutations in exons and regulatory regions12,13. Here, we report the first detailed analysis of
a human cancer classically associated with tobacco smoking, giving unprecedented insights
into the mutational burden associated with this lifestyle choice. Such analyses signpost the
advances that will be made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of cancer as we
sequence hundreds to thousands of human tumours15.

RESULTS
Sequencing of a SCLC cell line
Most small cell lung cancers are not surgically resected7, meaning that cell lines are an
indispensable resource for studying this disease. NCI-H209 is an immortal cell line derived
from a bone marrow metastasis of a 55 year old male with SCLC, taken before
chemotherapy16. The smoking history of the patient is not recorded16. However, the

specimen showed histologically typical small cells with classic neuroendocrine features:
>97% of such tumours are associated with tobacco-smoking17,18. An EBV-transformed
lymphoblastoid line, NCI-BL209, has been generated from the patient. NCI-H209 has been
extensively characterised by spectral karyotyping, capillary sequencing and high-resolution
copy-number array (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Using the SOLiD platform, we generated 25bp short-read, mate-pair shotgun sequences
from the tumour and matched normal genomes. Based on detailed power calculations, we
estimated that tumour and normal genomes should be sequenced to 30-fold depth to identify
somatically acquired genetic variants with high sensitivity and distinguish them from both
sequencing errors and germline polymorphisms (figure 1A). In total, 112Gb (39x coverage)
from the tumour and 90Gb (31x) from the normal were aligned to the reference genome
(figure 1B).
Bioinformatic algorithms were developed to identify somatically acquired genetic variation
from the sequencing data (supplementary figure 1, supplementary tables 1-5), subjected to
rigorous validation by PCR and capillary sequencing. We had previously identified 29 base
substitutions, of which 22 (76%) were called by our algorithm from the SOLiD sequencing
data (supplementary results; supplementary table 6). 79 novel coding substitutions and 354
randomly chosen genome-wide variants called by the algorithm were also tested. 77 (97%)
of the coding substitutions and 333 (94%) of the random variants were confirmed as genuine
somatic mutations (supplementary table 7). Neither of two known indels in coding sequence
was identified. Of putative somatic indels that were called, the true-positive rate was 25% by
capillary sequencing (supplementary results; supplementary table 8). Therefore, only
somatic indels which were confirmed by capillary sequencing are reported here. All somatic
genomic rearrangements called by anomalous read-pairs were validated by PCR and
capillary sequencing across the breakpoint, as previously described14.
Repertoire of somatic mutation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Overall, 22,910 somatically acquired substitutions were identified across the NCI-H209
genome, and a further 65 indels, 334 copy number segments and 58 structural variants were
confirmed (table 1, figure 1C, supplementary tables 1-5).
For point mutations in coding regions, we found the previously described RB1 C706F
mutation, known to abrogate protein function19, and the mutation that disrupts a splice site
in TP53. Combined loss of RB1 and TP53 is a characteristic feature of SCLC, confirming
that NCI-H209 is genetically typical of this disease. One G>T transversion generated a
premature stop codon in MLL2. We have observed clustering of truncating mutations in this
gene, a histone methyltransferase, in renal cancer (manuscript submitted). Of coding
variants, 92 are predicted to change amino acids, and 36 are synonymous. Since cancer is a
clonal disease in which the phenotypic consequences of mutation are subject to Darwinian
natural selection, accumulation of mutations conferring selective advantage on cancer
subclones will manifest as an excess of non-synonymous mutations. However, the observed
non-synonymous:synonymous ratio of 2.56:1 is not significantly different from that
expected by chance (p=0.3), suggesting that the majority of coding variants do not confer a
selective advantage to the cancer.
Due to the limited throughput of capillary sequencing, there has previously been little
attempt to explore regulatory regions of the genome for potential oncogenic mutations. To
address this, we extracted somatic substitutions occurring within 2kb either side of known
transcription start sites, which would generally include gene promoters. Mutations were
evenly distributed across the 4kb regions (supplementary figure 2A). We applied hidden
Markov models to predict which substitutions might affect transcription factor binding sites.

The distribution observed was no different to that seen in random, simulated sets of
‘mutations’ (supplementary figure 2B), suggesting that, analogous to substitutions in coding
sequence, most of those found in regulatory regions are selectively neutral to the cancer.
Nonetheless, as with coding mutations, there may be a small number which alter
transcription factor binding and affect gene regulation, thus providing phenotypic variation
for selection to act upon. For example, a T>G mutation 49bp upstream of the transcription
start site of a gene in the RAS oncogene family, RAB42, is predicted to have significant
disruptive effects on a potential binding motif for the RAS-responsive RREB1 transcription
factor (p=3×10−98; supplementary figure 2C).
Taken together, these data suggest that the majority of mutations in coding and promoter
regions of the NCI-H209 genome are passenger events, conferring no selective advantage to
the cells. Ranking algorithms can be useful to prioritise variants for further study, but the
key evidence for identifying driver mutations is recurrence in independent tumour samples,
supplemented by functional studies.
Multiple mutation signatures in NCI-H209
Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 carcinogens which bind and chemically modify
DNA, characteristically forming bulky adducts at purine bases (guanine and adenine)3.
Adducts distort the DNA helix and, if not corrected by nucleotide excision repair (NER) or
other pathways, allow non-Watson-Crick pairing during DNA replication. The
physicochemical properties of the mutagen determine which adduct is formed, what repair
mechanism is induced and which mis-pairing is permissible3. The substantial mutational
load carried in the NCI-H209 genome allows us to discern with great statistical power
several distinct mutation signatures, genomic records of the medley of mutagens deposited
in the airways and lungs by tobacco smoking.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

G>T/C>A transversions were the commonest change observed (34%), followed by G>A/
C>T (21%) and A>G/T>C (19%) transitions (figure 2A). This distribution is remarkably
similar to the pattern of substitutions observed in TP53 in SCLC cases curated from the
published literature (supplementary figure 3). This implies firstly that the NCI-H209
genome is typical of SCLC, and therefore of tobacco-associated mutational profiles, and
secondly that the majority of mutations were acquired in vivo, not during cell culture. G>T
transversions caused by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons occur more frequently at
methylated CpG dinucleotides in vitro and in TP5320,21. To explore this genome-wide, we
compared the base preceding G>T mutations with the base before wild-type guanines in
NCI-H209 (figure 2B). CpG dinucleotides were significantly enriched amongst the G>T
mutation set compared to controls (odds ratio (OR), 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.6; p<0.0001). We
can use the fact that only 10-20% of CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands are constitutively
methylated compared to 60-70% outside of CpG islands22 to assess how cytosinemethylation affects mutations at the neighbouring guanine (figure 2C). G>T mutations at
CpG dinucleotides were significantly more likely to be found outside CpG islands than
expected by chance (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.8; p=0.02), suggesting that these transversions
do indeed preferentially occur at methylated CpGs.
We next assessed the base preceding the guanine for G>A and G>C mutations (figure 2B).
For G>A transitions, striking enrichment of CpG dinucleotides was observed in the mutation
set compared to wild-type guanines in the genome (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 3.7-4.3; p<0.0001),
and these showed a strong propensity to occur outside CpG islands (OR, 2.6; 95% CI,
1.6-4.1; p<0.0001). This is consistent with the well-described phenomenon of spontaneous
deamination of methylated cytosine to uracil, read as thymine. Although G>C transversions
showed a similar enrichment for CpG context (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9-2.5; p<0.0001), these
were significantly more likely to occur within CpG islands (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-1.0;

p=0.05), suggesting that the carcinogen responsible targets unmethylated CpG dinucleotides.
In keeping with previous reports23,24, we found that the guanine base in G>C transversions
was more frequently followed by an adenine than expected by chance (OR, 1.4; 95% CI,
1.3-1.5; p<0.0001).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For mutations involving adenines, fewer substitutions of all classes were seen at GpA
dinucleotides than expected by chance (p<0.0001; figure 2D), and A>T and A>G occurred
significantly more frequently at TpA than expected (p<0.0001). Among somatically
acquired indels, single base-pair insertions were more likely to be gains of A or T
nucleotides than C or G (8:1). Curiously, single base deletions favoured loss of C/G
nucleotides, rather than A/T (26:12), and there was a propensity for the C/G deletions to
occur at CC or GG dimers or longer (18/26). In contrast to the frequency of indels at runs of
A or T nucleotides, deletions at C or G tracts are not well described, and our findings may
reflect a distinct mutation signature.
Thus, the sequence context of the ~23,000 mutations in the NCI-H209 genome provides
tremendous power to identify multiple distinctive mutation signatures, not evident from
targeted resequencing studies of limited genomic regions.
Imprint of two DNA repair pathways

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Several pathways can repair DNA lesions caused by exogenous carcinogens. Bulky adducts
on purines are the predominant form of DNA damage induced by tobacco carcinogens, and
can be sufficiently disruptive to impede RNA polymerase when they occur on the
transcribed strand of genes. Stalled RNA polymerases can recruit the nucleotide excision
repair machinery, leading to excision of the altered nucleotide, preventing mutation. In
studies of TP53 mutations in lung cancer, G>T transversions occur more frequently on the
non-transcribed strand2,5, suggesting that many of the same lesions occurring on the
transcribed strand are correctly identified and removed by the cell. We found that guanine
and adenine substitutions are generally less frequent on the transcribed than the nontranscribed strand (supplementary figure 4), confirming that purines appear to be the major
target of carcinogens in tobacco smoke.
We next correlated mutation prevalence to gene expression (figure 2E). For a given level of
gene expression, the effects of transcription-coupled repair are revealed by the significant
separation of curves for mutations on the transcribed and non-transcribed strands. We found
evidence for significant transcription-coupled repair for G>T transversions (p<0.0001), as
well as A>G (p=0.003) and A>T (p=0.03), possibly G>C (p=0.08), but not G>A (p=0.3) or
A>C (p=0.8) mutations. Thus, the extent of transcription-coupled repair differs for the
various classes of mutation, presumably reflecting differences in the ability of the
transcription-coupled repair machinery to recognise and/or repair different adduct lesions.
For most mutations, there appears to be another novel expression-linked repair pathway that
operates on both strands and is at least as numerically important as transcription-coupled
repair. Thus, significantly lower mutation prevalence, on both transcribed and nontranscribed strands, was observed in more highly expressed genes for G>T (p<0.0001), G>A
(p<0.0001), G>C (p<0.0001) and A>T (p<0.0001). Again, there are some interesting
differences across mutation classes in the relative contributions of the two repair pathways.
For A>G mutations, only transcribed strand mutations decreased with higher gene
expression, suggesting that transcription-coupled repair is the more important pathway for
preventing such events. In contrast, G>A mutations occurred equally on transcribed and
non-transcribed strands, but mutations on both strands were significantly reduced in more
highly expressed genes, suggesting that the novel expression-linked repair pathway is more
important than transcription-coupled repair here.

Taken together, these data imply that at least two separate DNA repair pathways have been
enlisted for protection of the NCI-H209 genome, notwithstanding the difficulties in
extrapolating cell line expression levels to in vivo expression during cancer progression. The
fact that the two pathways have operated with differing efficacy across the six classes of
mutation implies that the lesions have distinct physicochemical effects on DNA structure,
with variable recognition and excision by the genome surveillance machinery.

Genomic rearrangements and copy number
We identified 58 somatically acquired genomic rearrangements in the NCI-H209 genome.
These include 18 (31%) deletions and 9 (16%) tandem duplications. The majority of
rearrangements, however, cannot be ascribed to classical structural variant patterns, due to
the considerably greater complexity of somatically acquired rearrangements compared to
germline events. This is exemplified by a set of rearrangements incorporating regions from
chromosomes 1p32-36 and 4q25-28 (figure 3). Here, most of the intrachromosomal
rearrangements are in inverted orientation, but cannot be classical inversions since they
demarcate copy number changes and do not have reciprocal breakpoints. By similar
reasoning, most interchromosomal rearrangements also appear to be unbalanced. Other
clusters of unbalanced rearrangements were found in NCI-H209, including chromosomes 3q
and 5q, and we have seen this phenomenon in many other solid tumour genomes.
Chromosomal rearrangements can juxtapose two genes: if they are in the same orientation
with an intact open reading frame, an oncogenic fusion gene may result. In NCI-H209, a
predicted in-frame fusion gene was created by a 240kb deletion on chr16, adjoining the first
two exons of CREBBP with the 3′ portion of BTBD12, a gene involved in repair of dsDNA
breaks25,26. Interestingly, in acute myeloid leukaemia, CREBBP is recurrently fused with
MYST327. RT-PCR showed that the predicted CREBBP-BTBD12 fusion transcript is
expressed in NCI-H209, but not in 55 other SCLC cell lines. The significance of the
predicted fusion gene with respect to cancer development is therefore unclear.
CHD7 rearrangements in SCLC cell lines

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Intrachromosomal rearrangements can also result in internal rearrangements of genes,
through loss or duplication of exons. A 39kb tandem duplication was found in CHD7,
predicted to lead to in-frame duplication of exons 3-8 (figure 4A). We previously identified
a massively amplified and highly expressed fusion gene comprising exons 1-3 of PVT1, a
non-coding RNA gene immediately downstream of MYC, and exons 4-38 of CHD7 in
another SCLC cell line, NCI-H217114. This raises the possibility that CHD7 rearrangements
may be recurrent in SCLC. Using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, we
identified a further SCLC cell line (LU-135) with internal exon copy number alterations,
among 63 lines screened (supplementary figure 5). LU-135 was therefore studied by matepair sequencing (figure 4B). This demonstrated that, as for NCI-H2171, the CHD7 amplicon
was linked to MYC amplification. One breakpoint predicted the existence of a fusion gene
between exon 1 of PVT1 and exons 14-38 of CHD7 (figure 4C), and by RT-PCR across the
breakpoint, this transcript is expressed. In keeping with genomic amplification and active
expression of the PVT1 locus, NCI-H2171 and LU-135 show particularly elevated levels of
CHD7 transcripts (figure 4D). SCLC cell lines on average show a log2 greater expression of
CHD7 than both non-small cell lung cancer lines and other tumour types (p<0.0001).
Thus, CHD7 is rearranged in three SCLC cell lines. Two carry a PVT1-CHD7 fusion gene
in the setting of MYC amplification. PVT1 is a non-coding gene immediately downstream
of MYC, and may itself be a transcriptional target of the MYC protein28. Insertion of CHD7
into this locus with subsequent amplification gives the double hit of increased gene copy
number and regulatory elements for a co-amplified transcription factor, explaining the

massive over-expression seen in these cell lines. PVT1 is recurrently rearranged in variant
Burkitt lymphoma translocations29, and may be oncogenic30. The NCI-H209
rearrangement is predicted to duplicate one of the two chromodomains. CHD7 is a
chromatin remodeller, promoting enhancer-mediated transcription through association with
histone H3K4-methylation31. Histone modifiers have been implicated as cancer genes32,
and a family member, CHD5, may function as a tumour suppressor gene33. Recurrent
rearrangements of CHD7 in SCLC would be an interesting extension of this theme if
functional studies and genomic analyses of primary samples confirm our data.

DISCUSSION
The compendium of somatic alterations in a cancer genome is shaped by multiple intrinsic
and extrinsic processes, including exposure to mutagens, selective pressures active in the
tissue microenvironment, genomic instability and DNA repair pathways15. The advent of
massively parallel sequencing portends an era in which unbiased, genome-wide mutation
screens allow the consequences of these processes to be discerned and decoded. Even in this
single lung cancer genome, we can identify several distinctive point mutation patterns,
reflecting the cocktail of carcinogens present in cigarette smoke, as well as signatures of the
partially successful attempts of the cell's surveillance machinery to repair DNA damage. The
complete catalogue of somatically acquired mutations in a given cancer harbours the subset
of variants that drive the neoplastic phenotype, and a likely candidate, CHD7 rearrangement,
has emerged from the NCI-H209 genome.

Tobacco smoke deposits many hundreds of chemicals in the airways and lungs. Each
carcinogen-associated mutation represents the consequence of three processes: chemical
modification of a purine by a mutagen, failure to repair the lesion by genome surveillance
pathways and incorrect nucleotide incorporation opposite the distorted base during DNA
replication. G>T transversions are the commonest substitution in NCI-H209, mutations
previously linked to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons3 and acrolein21 in tobacco smoke.
We found enrichment of G>T mutations at CpG dinucleotides, especially outside CpG
islands, supporting in vitro evidence that these carcinogens preferentially bind methyl-CpG
dinucleotides20,21. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons containing a cyclopentane ring have
been associated with G>C transversions34. We found them enriched at CpG dinucleotides,
but, in contrast to G>T and G>A mutations, our data suggest that unmethylated-CpGs are
the target here, underscoring the remarkable statistical power genome-wide mutation screens
give for delineating mutation spectra.
We can also infer signatures of DNA repair in cancer genomes. Transcription-coupled repair
is induced by stalling of RNA polymerase at bulky adducts on the transcribed strand, and we
saw evidence for this process in NCI-H209. We have also discovered the imprint of a novel
and more general form of expression-linked repair, through which mutation frequency is
reduced on both strands in highly expressed genes. The expression-linked decrease in
mutation frequency may reflect global genomic nucleotide excision repair, in which
distorting adducts are corrected genome-wide35. Why this pathway should be more
effective in highly transcribed regions is unclear. One possibility is that ssDNA formed on
both strands during transcription facilitates recognition of the adduct, and there is some
evidence that components of the NER pathway can recognize adducts in ssDNA36.
Strikingly, some mutation types were repaired almost exclusively by transcription-coupled
repair (A>G), some showed evidence for only the more general expression-linked repair
(G>A), while others had features of both mechanisms (G>T, A>T). Such differences are
presumably determined by the physicochemical properties of the multitudinous adducts
induced by carcinogens present in tobacco smoke.

On average, lung cancer develops after 50 pack-years of smoking37. Candidate gene
resequencing studies suggest that the mutation prevalence in NCI-H209 is similar to that of
primary lung cancers38,39. If the majority of mutations derive from the mélange of
mutagens present in tobacco smoke, the clone of cells that ultimately becomes cancerous
would acquire, over its lifetime, an average of one mutation for every 15 cigarettes smoked.
If this is the case in a localised cluster of cells, then the number of mutations acquired across
the whole bronchial tree from even one cigarette must be substantial. The data presented
here demonstrate the power of whole genome sequencing to disentangle the many complex
mutational signatures found in cancers induced by tobacco smoke.

METHOD SUMMARY
Massively parallel, shotgun sequencing of genomic DNA from NCI-H209 and the matched
EBV-transformed B-cell line was performed on the SOLiD platform (Life Technologies,
Foster City, CA) to a target >30-fold depth. Mate-pair 25bp reads were mapped back to the
NCBI36 reference genome in 2-base encoded colour space. Bespoke bioinformatic
algorithms were developed to identify all classes of somatically acquired genetic variant
from the sequencing data. PCR and capillary sequencing on DNA from both tumour and
normal lines was performed to confirm all putative somatically acquired genomic
rearrangements and indels, together with random samples of coding and non-coding
substitutions. To identify potential regulatory consequences of point mutations, substitutions
in promoter regions were compared against random samples of simulated variants for effects
on predicted transcription-factor binding sites. The sequence context of mutation positions
was compared against randomly sampled genomic positions which had sufficient sequence
coverage by chi-squared tests. Gene expression levels for NCI-H209 were determined on the
Affymetrix U133A microarray, and analysed for mutation prevalence by Poisson regression.

METHODS
Power calculations

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To estimate the levels of coverage required for accurate detection of somatically acquired
base substitutions, we make the following assumptions:
1.

Tumour DNA is approximately diploid, with 3.2Gb per cell.

2.

All reads can be mapped back correctly to the genome, even if they have a
mutation, SNP or sequencing error.

3.

Mutations and SNPs are heterozygous (homozygous variants are much easier to
detect accurately).

4.

Mutation prevalence 1/Mb; SNP prevalence 1/kb; sequencing error rate averaged
1/100 bases, with moderate degrees of systematic error (allowing different bases in
the genome to have different error rates); overdispersion 2.0 (ratio of the variance
of coverage as reads/base exceeds the mean reads/base).

5.

We use the following strategy for calling a mutation at a given base, which is
covered by CT reads in the tumour DNA and CN reads in the normal DNA:
•

Of the CT reads in tumour DNA, the substitution is seen in a greater
number of reads than the other two possible substitutions, with at least as
many reads as a particular threshold, κ(CT).

•

Of the CN reads in the normal DNA, the number of reads containing a
particular substitution must be fewer than a threshold, κ(CN).

For example, for a base covered 10x in the tumour and normal, we might require at
least 4 reads of the tumour to have a variant base call which was not seen in any of
the reads from the normal. The optimal choice of strategy (ie the set of κ(CT) and
κ(CN) for all CT and CN) will depend on the sequencing error rates, systematicity
of sequencing errors, level of contamination, mutation rate and SNP rate. For these
calculations, the optimal strategy for each set of conditions was defined as the set
of κ(CT) and κ(CN) which minimized the miscall rate (either failing to call a
mutation or calling a SNP or non-variant base a mutation).
The probability of calling a true mutation and the probabilities of mis-calls of sequencing
errors and SNPs as mutations are calculated for each level of coverage of tumour and normal
genomes, based on the κ(CT) and κ(CN) thresholds above, a binomial distribution of alleles
(for heterozygous variants) and sequencing errors following a beta-binomial distribution.
The distribution of coverages for the genome is then modeled by a negative binomial
distribution to account for overdispersion, and the overall true and false positive rates
summed.
Sequencing
Genomic DNA was used to construct mate pair libraries of different insert sizes, The
smallest insert libraries were from 600bp-800bp and the largest were 3-4kb. Library
preparation, emulsion PCR, slide preparation and sequencing were all performed according
to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems SOLiD Library Preparation Protocol).
Sequencing generated 25bp tags in colour space from each end of the DNA fragment.
Primary data analysis including image analysis and base-calling was carried out with the
corona pipeline (Applied Biosystems). Alignment of reads to the NCBI36 reference genome
(translated into colour space) was performed with corona-lite (version 0.32), allowing 2
mismatches in mapping and up to 4 in the pairing step. Duplicate read pairs with identical
coordinates were removed, and only uniquely mapping reads were used for analysis.
Substitution detection

The corona-lite pipeline (version 0.32) was used to generate a preliminary list of variant
bases from the uniquely aligning reads. We used the optimal thresholds defined in point 5 of
the power calculations above (based on a mutation prevalence of 8/Mb, as estimated from
capillary sequence data in COSMIC) to determine whether there was sufficient evidence for
calling a somatic substitution or not at each base in this preliminary list. Resulting tumourspecific substitutions were further filtered to remove (i) those residing in regions of LOH in
the normal cell line, (ii) those potentially due to misalignment in segmental duplications and
near sequence gaps, (iii) those corresponding to polymorphic positions in dbSNP, (iv) those
potentially due to misalignment or miscalls as they are adjacent to SNPs or within 5 bp of
insertions and deletions and (v) those where all supporting reads contained the putative
variant in the first or last 5bp of the read (to reduce effects of misalignment across indels).
Substitutions were annotated using Ensembl version 52.
The bioinformatic algorithm initially compares the tumour genome against the published
reference genome to identify variants, before comparing it against the EBV-transformed line
to determine whether the variant is somatically acquired or germline. Thus, a mutation in the
B-cell line induced by EBV transformation will not be falsely detected as a variant in the
SCLC line. However, one potential artefact resulting from changes induced by EBV
transformation is in regions where there is loss of heterozygosity – this could potentially
lead to false mutation calls in the tumour because the EBV line contains only one allele at
heterozygous SNP positions. For this reason, we excluded regions of LOH in the EBV line
from the mutation-calling algorithm (filter criterion (i) above).

LOH in the normal cell line was determined by analysis of the EBV-transformed B-cell line
on an Affymetrix SNP6 array, using hidden Markov model algorithms for identification of
allele-specific copy number.
Insertion & deletion detection

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Small insertions (up to 3 bp) and deletions (up to 11 bp) were called using corona-lite
(version 0.4). Indels found in the tumour and not in the normal were further filtered to
require (i) minimum three supporting tumour reads, (ii) minimum one read on each strand,
(iii) no LOH in the normal, (iv) maximum 100X coverage (to remove regions of
misalignment) and (v) minimum 30X normal coverage (to reduce the number of germline
indels in the set).
Structural variant detection
Abnormal read pairs that mapped to the genome with MAQ at an unexpected distance or
orientation were identified, grouped and filtered as described14. To define somatic variants,
at least 8 independent read pairs were required in the tumour, and a maximum number in the
normal were allowed as defined based on the same optimal thresholds used in substitution
calling.
Confirmation by capillary sequencing
A set of 79 novel coding mutations and 354 randomly chosen, genome-wide substitutions
predicted by the algorithm, and 262 small insertions and deletions, were taken forward for
independent validation by capillary sequencing across the region of the mutation. Structural
variants were confirmed by PCR across the breakpoint and capillary sequencing the
breakpoint. All confirmations were done in both the tumour and normal to determine if the
variants were somatic or germline.
Copy number determination

Reads were counted in windows across the genome, corrected for genome uniqueness as
described14. Circular binary segmentation was used to segment the data, using a
Bioconductor package originally designed for array-CGH data40. The adaptation of the
algorithm for shotgun sequencing data has been described in detail elsewhere14.
Substitution analysis
For mutation context, the bases ±10 bp from the mutation were extracted and the number of
each base counted. Context of equivalent changes (eg. C>T and G>A) were combined. The
background context was determined from 200,000 randomly sampled bases from the
genome at positions in which sufficient coverage of the tumour and normal genomes was
achieved. Strand bias was calculated based on annotating each mutation as to whether it fell
on the transcribed or untranscribed strand in Ensembl 52. Gene expression data were derived
from the Affymetrix U133A array. Chi-squared testing was performed to detect departures
of observed mutation context from that expected in the covered genome. Poisson regression
was used for the analysis of the effects of gene expression on mutation prevalence,
incorporating the number of at-risk bases in each gene footprint as the offset, allowing
quadratic terms for the relationship between expression and mutation prevalence, and using
a dummy variable for transcribed vs non-transcribed strand mutations. The image of the
entire NCI-H209 genome was produced using Circos41.
Analysis of promoter mutations
The promoter region of each gene was defined as the 2000bp each side of the transcription
start site (TSS) for its representative transcript. Some of the promoters defined this way

overlapped, giving 63.9 Mbp of unique sequence. We mapped the substitutions to the gene
with the nearest TSS, and confirmed that the reference bases provided matched the
corresponding bases in the reference genome. We investigated the impact of the somatic
substitutions on transcription factor binding to the promoter regions using a Sunflower
model42 based on the JASPAR databases's43 set of vertebrate transcription factors. The
database contains two matrices for the transcription factor Lhx3: one based on human data,
and one from mouse. The mouse factor was excluded and the remaining 100 matrices used
to build the model with an unbound prior probability of 0.99; leaving 1 × 10−4 for each
factor. The G+C content was close to 50% for the promoters for both lines, so we used a at
distribution for the unbound emission probabilities (A = C = G = T = 0.25).
The reference sequences for each promoter, plus 300bp of padding sequence on each end
(4600 bp per promoter in total) were downloaded from Ensembl 53. The padding sequence
is necessary for two reasons. First, the posterior probability decoding of Sunflower is
unreliable near the beginning and end of a sequence42. Second, if a transcription factor
binding site overlaps the beginning or end of the sequence, it cannot be correctly modeled as
only part of its state loop will be traversed.

For the set of observed substitutions, we generated the variant promoters from the reference
sequences. We also randomly sampled the unobserved substitutions according to the
mutation distributions of the observed substitutions. As a further control, these were
restricted to the same mutation type per promoter as the observed substitutions. For
example, if a promoter had a C>T substitution at position −160, the set of possible
unobserved substitutions for that promoter would be all of the other possible C>T and G>A
substitutions. If a promoter had multiple observed substitutions, any of those types were
allowed in the sampling. Variant sequences for 1000 sets of random unobserved
substitutions were generated. The set size was the same as the observed set size, for a total
of 315,000 unobserved substitutions. Using the pairwise comparison functionality of
Sunflower and the 100-factor JASPAR model, we compared the variant sequences to the
reference sequences, obtaining a relative entropy value for each. To ensure that the results
were related to real binding sites and not random noise, we randomly shuffled the columns
of all the JASPAR position weight matrices (PWMs) to create new sets of matrices. From
100 such sets, we built Sunflower models using the same parameters as for the real JASPAR
data, and compared the variant promoter sequences to their references for the observed
substitutions.
CHD7 analysis
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for CHD7 was performed using
the commercially available assay (MRC-Holland b.v., Amsterdam, Netherlands) according
to manufacturer's instructions. Identification of rearrangements in LU-135 was performed
using a 3-4kb mate-pair library sequenced on the SOLiD platform, as described above.
Rearrangements were confirmed by PCR and capillary sequencing across the breakpoint.
RT-PCR across aberrant exon junctions was used to assess expression of the PVT1-CHD7
fusion transcripts (NCI-H2171 and LU-135) and the internal duplication of exons 3-8 (NCIH209). RT-PCR products were capillary sequenced to confirm their veracity. Gene
expression data were derived from the Affymetrix U133A array for the core cell lines listed
on our website (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/CellLines/).
