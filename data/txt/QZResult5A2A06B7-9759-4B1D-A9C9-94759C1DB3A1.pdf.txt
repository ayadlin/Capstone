Abstract
Effective activation of dendritic cells (DCs) toward T helper (Th)-1 cell polarization would improve DCbased antitumor immunotherapy, helping promote the development of immunotherapeutic vaccines based
on T-cell immunity. To achieve this goal, it is essential to develop effective immune adjuvants that can induce
powerful Th1 cell immune responses. The pathogenic organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis includes certain
constitutes, such as heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA), that possess a strong immunostimulatory
potential. In this study, we report the first clarification of the functions and precise mechanism of HBHA in
immune stimulation settings relevant to cancer. HBHA induced DC maturation in a TLR4-dependent manner,
elevating expression of the surface molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86, MHC classes I and II and the
proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12, IL-1b, TNF-a, and CCR7, as well as stimulating the migratory capacity
of DCs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations established that MyD88 and TRIF signaling pathways
downstream of TLR4 mediated secretion of HBHA-induced proinflammatory cytokines. HBHA-treated DCs
activated naïve T cells, polarized CD4þ and CD8þ T cells to secrete IFN-g, and induced T-cell–mediated
cytotoxicity. Notably, systemic administration of DCs that were HBHA-treated and OVA251–264-pulsed ex vivo
greatly strengthened immune priming in vivo, inducing a dramatic regression of tumor growth associated
with long-term survival in a murine E.G7 thymoma model. Together, our findings highlight HBHA as an
immune adjuvant that favors Th1 polarization and DC function for potential applications in DC-based
antitumor immunotherapy. Cancer Res; 71(8); 2858–70. 2011 AACR.

Owing to the immunosuppressive environment within a
tumor, effective antitumor therapy requires the powerful
induction of appropriate immune responses. Dendritic cell
(DC)-based antitumor immunotherapy is mediated by specialized interactions between DCs and T lymphocytes (1).
For all DC-based antitumor immunotherapeutic strategies,
several factors that relate to the in vitro manipulation of DCs
are important for the induction of a powerful immune
response in patients. These factors include DC lineage,
amount and type of antigen (Ag) loading on DCs, maturation
stage of DCs, and route of injection (2). Evidence has suggested that immunostimulatory adjuvants are critical for the
maturation of immature DCs, which boosts the activity of DCs
as well as enhances T-cell–mediated immune responses.
Therefore, the use of poorly immunogenic Ags combined with
effective adjuvants can enhance specific T helper (Th)-1 cell
responses. Although many adjuvants have been discovered,
the use of adjuvant(s) for DC-based antitumor immunotherapy is limited due to safety concerns and unforeseen inappropriate immune responses (3).

M. tuberculosis HBHA for Cancer Vaccines

Because Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation usually induces
Th1 responses, TLR ligands are potential candidates for immunostimulatory adjuvants in anticancer therapy (4). On recognition of their ligands, TLRs mediate signals via 2 intracytoplasmic
adaptor molecules, myeloid differentiation primary response
protein (MyD88) and Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor
inducing IFNb (TRIF), which are used by all TLRs except TLR3
(5). In the recent years, synthetic agonists of TLR3, TLR4, TLR5,
TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 have been identified as suitable immunostimulants (6–11). In fact, based on the efficacy of TLR
agonists, the use of TLR ligands as adjuvants in humans is
likely to increase in the near future. Furthermore, DC activation
by various microbial components through TLRs’ signaling is a
critical link between innate and adaptive immunity and is
crucial for the generation of protective immune responses.
Adjuvants inducing Th1-type responses are essential for
effective immunotherapeutic strategies. Because some components expressed by organism of the genus Mycobacterium
and related genera, showed strong Th1-type adjuvancity, a
significant effort has been focused on identifying and characterizing these mycobacterial proteins (12). Although an
immunotherapeutic approach using mycobacterial Ags
appears to be clinically effective, the precise mechanism by
which these Ags mediate immune stimulation has not been
adequately clarified (12).
To date, it is known that M. tuberculosis interacts with Agpresenting cells, specifically DCs (13). In addition, we recently
showed that the Mycobacterium avium protein fibronectin
attachment protein induces DC maturation and Th1 polarization (14). These reports provide direct evidences for the
potential use of mycobacterial proteins in DC-based antitumor immunotherapies to induce the activation of T-cell–
mediated cytotoxicity.
The M. tuberculosis protein, heparin-binding hemagglutinin
(HBHA) was recently identified as surface-exposed and
secreted Ag. This protein is a virulence factor that promotes
bacterial aggregation, adhesion to heparin sulfate proteoglycans of nonphagocytic cells, and dissemination of tubercle
bacilli from the lungs to other tissues in patients with tuberculosis (15, 16). HBHA induces protective immunity against M.
tuberculosis by triggering the interferon (IFN)-g production in
CD4þ and CD8þ T lymphocytes (17). Thus, it could serve as an
immnoadjuvants to design and develop immunotherapies
against various diseases including if the detailed elucidation
of the cellular immune responses to HBHA. However, very
little is known about the antitumor activity of HBHA mediated
by inducing DC maturation and, hence, promoting T-cell
immunity.
To clarify the action mechanism of HBHA and its potential
use as an adjuvant in DC-based antitumor immunotherapies,
we investigated whether HBHA exhibits an antitumor effect in
DC-based vaccination in a mouse model.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Male 6–8-week old C57BL/6 (H-2Kb and I-Ab) mice were
purchased from the Korean Institute of Chemistry Technology

Expression and purification of recombinant HBHA
Dr. G. Delogu (University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy) kindly
provided the pMV3–38 plasmid (pMV206-based construct)
containing the full-length HBHA open reading frame. Methylated-recombinant HBHA expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis was purified as previously described (18). Preparation
of M. smegmatis competent cells and electroporation procedures were performed as previously described (19). A
Detoxi-Gel Endotoxin Removing Gel (Pierce) was used
to remove endotoxin. Finally, the protein concentration
was determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce)
and the purified protein was stored at –80 C in aliquots
until use in the subsequent experiments. To evaluate the
purity of rHBHA, SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue
(CB) staining, immunoblot assay using antihistidine antibody and silver nitrate staining as previously described

Generation and culture of DCs
Bone marrow-derived DCs were isolated and cultured as
recently described (20). In certain experiments, DCs were
labeled with bead-conjugated anti-CD11c mAb and positively
selected (>90%) according to the manufacturer's instructions
(LS columns; Miltenyi Biotec).

injected s.c. in the hind-leg footpad. Popliteal lymph nodes
(LNs) were removed 72 hours later, mechanically disaggregated, and treated with collagenase A (1 mg/mL; Boehringer
Mannheim) and DNase (0.4 mg/mL; Roche) for 30 minutes.
The enzymatically treated cell suspension was evaluated for
the percentage of CFSEþ DCs by FACScan (Becton Dickinson).

Therapeutic implanted tumor experiments
Mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the right lower
back with EL4 or E.G7 thymoma cells (2  106), followed by
intravenous injection of immature DCs and HBHA-treated
DCs (1  106) pulsed with or without OVA (1 mg/mL) via the
tail vein on days 1, 3, and 5 after tumor inoculation. Groups of
tumor-bearing mice were treated with PBS, iDCs (untreated
immature DCs), DCs-OVA (DCs pulsed with OVA peptide), or
HBHA-DCs-OVA (HBHA-treated DCs pulsed with OVA peptide). Tumor size was measured every 2 days, and tumor mass
was calculated as: V ¼ (2A  B)/2, where A is the length of the
short axis and B is the length of the long axis.

In vivo imaging
Nude mice were preinjected with TNF-a in the hind-leg
footpad (30 ng/leg). A total of 1  106 labeled DCs in 50 mL PBS
was injected s.c. in the hind-leg footpad. After 2 days, mice
were anesthetized with an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of
100 mL/kg zoletil 50 solution (Virbac Korea). In vivo imaging
was performed using the Maestro in vivo imaging system (CRI,
ex ¼ 797 nm; em ¼ 830 nm long-pass).

Confocal laser scanning microscopy
Cells were permeabilized with 1% saponin for 3 minutes,
stained with anti-mouse HBHA followed by Alexa568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody overnight at 4 C, and then
stained with Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse TLR2 or TLR4/
MD2 for 3 hours at room temperature. Cell morphology and
fluorescence intensity were analyzed using a confocal laser
scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM510 Meta). Images were
acquired using the LSM510 Meta software and processed
using the LSM image examiner.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
DCs (5  106) were incubated with 1 mg/mL HBHA for 24
hours, and cell pellets were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.0 mmol/L EDTA, 1.0% NP-40, 2.0
mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 10 mg/mL
aprotinin, and 10 mg/mL leupeptine). Total cell lysates were
precleared with protein G Sepharose for 2 hours at 4 C.
HBHA-associated proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubation with protein G Sepharose for 24 hours at 4 C after
incubation with anti-goat as control Ab for anti-TLR2, antiTLR2, anti-rat as control Ab for anti-TLR4, or anti-TLR4 Abs
for 1 hour at 4 C. Samples were eluted, and immunoblot
analysis was performed using an anti-HBHA mAb.
Antigen uptake quantification
Ag uptake was performed as recently described (14). Briefly,
DCs (2  105) were equilibrated at 37 C or 4 C for 30 minutes
and pulsed with 1 mg/mL FITC-conjugated dextran for 45
minutes, and then the action was stopped with cold staining
buffer. Washed cells were stained with PE-conjugated antiCD11c and analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer.
In vitro and in vivo migration of DCs
In vitro chemotaxis was performed as previously reported
(21). For the in vivo migration test, DCs were labeled with
0.5 mmol/L carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
(CFSE; Molecular Probes). Labeled cells (1  106) were

OVA-specific CD8þ T cells, derived from C57BL/6 OT-1 TCR
transgenic mice, were negatively selected using a mouse CD8þ
T-cell kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)
was performed as recently described (22).
ELISA for IFN-g and IL-2
BALB/c mice were injected with PBS, untreated DCs, DCspulsed with OVA257–264, or HBHA-treated DCs-pulsed with
OVA257–264 on days 1 and 7. Seven days following the final
injection, splenocytes (2  106 per well) were isolated and
restimulated for 24 hours with 10 mg/mL OVA257–264, and the
culture supernatant was used for the detection of IFN-g and
IL-2 by using ELISA.
In vivo CTL assay
C57BL/6 mice were injected with PBS, untreated DCs, DCspulsed with OVA257–264, or HBHA-treated DCs-pulsed with
OVA257–264 on days 1 and 7. At the 7 days after last immunization, spleen cells from syngeneic mice were red blood cell lysed
followed by pulsing with or without 10 mg/mL OVA257–264 for
45 minutes at 37 C. Then, the OVA257–264 pulsed and unpulsed
populations were loaded with either 5 mM (high) or 0.5 mM
(low) carboxyfluoroscein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Molecular
Probe) at 37 C for 10 minutes. The 2 cell populations were
mixed 1:1 before tail vein injection to the immunized mice (107
cells per mouse). At 4 hours after injection, spleens from
recipient mice were isolated and single cell suspensions were
prepared prior to flow cytometric analysis using a FACScan
(Becton Dickinson). The number of CFSEhigh and CFSElow
population were determined and the in vivo OVA-specific lysis
percentage was enumerated [24] A.M. Byers, C.C. Kemball, J.M.

M. tuberculosis HBHA for Cancer Vaccines

Results
HBHA induces DC maturation
Soluble recombinant HBHA was expressed in M. smegmatis
and characterized. Endotoxin levels in HBHA were undetectable (0.01 ng/mg; data not shown). The molecular mass of
HBHA was approximately 29 kDa. The purity of HBHA was
first assessed by sodium dodecyl SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting
with an antihistidine Ab (Fig. 1A). In addition, the purity of
rHBHA was quantified by Quantity-one software (Bio-Rad).
The purity of HBHA was calculated by percentage of HBHA
band against intensity/mm2 of the entire protein bands. The
rHBHA revealed 84 and 96% purity after using Ni-NTA column
only (left panel) and Ni-NTA followed by P11 column (right
panel), respectively when 20 mg of each protein were assessed
in silver nitrate staining (Supplementary Fig. 1). Apoptosis in
DC cultures exposed to HBHA up to 1 mg/mL did not change
significantly, as detected by Annexin V and PI staining
(Fig. 1B).
To investigate whether HBHA induces DC maturation, we
measured the expression of DC maturation markers involved
in Th activation, such as CD40, CD80, CD86, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and II by flow cytometry.
LPS served as a positive control. HBHA strongly induced the
expression of various surface molecules in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1C).
We then tested whether HBHA-treated DCs produce pro- or
antiinflammatory cytokines required for a Th response. DCs
secreted IL-12 and IL-10, which stimulate the proliferation and
development of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively (23). The levels
of IL-12 p40/p70 production in HBHA-treated DCs were
significantly (P < 0.05–0.001) greater than those produced
by untreated DCs (Fig. 1D). ELISA studies also revealed high
levels of IL-12p70 in the supernatant of HBHA-treated DCs
(Fig. 1E).
We also measured the production of IL-10, a pleiotropic
cytokine that inhibits DC function and Th1 responses (24).
Interestingly, unlike LPS, HBHA does not induce IL-10 in DCs
(Fig. 1D and 1E). In addition, HBHA-treated DCs showed an
enhanced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6,
and TNF-a) compared to untreated DCs (Fig. 1F). Similar to
treatment with LPS, HBHA treatment significantly decreased
the percentage of dextranþCD11cþ cells (Fig. 1G), as compared to untreated DCs. These results indicate that HBHA
significantly enhances the phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs.
TLR4 signaling is required for HBHA-induced DC
maturation
TLR2 and TLR4 have been reported to recognize M. tuberculosis in the context of activation and maturation of Agpresenting cells in vitro (25). Therefore, we examined whether
HBHA can be recognized by and acting through TLRs in DCs.
To identify TLRs on DCs that interact with HBHA, wild type
(WT), TLR2/, and TLR4/ DCs were stimulated with
HBHA, and HBHA on cell surface was detected with an
Alexa568-conjugated anti-HBHA mAb (Fig. 2A and B). AntiHBHA bound to the cell surface of WT, TLR2/ DCs, but not

www.aacrjournals.org

TLR4/ DCs. To confirm the interaction between HBHA and
TLR, we performed immunoprecipitation studies with TLR2
or TLR4 and HBHA in DCs. HBHA bound to TLR4 but not
TLR2 (Fig. 2C). This observation was also confirmed by
confocal microscopy. As expected, co-localization of HBHA
and TLR4 but not TLR2 was detected (Fig. 2D).
To test the ability of HBHA to activate DCs via TLR4, we
measured the expression of surface molecules and proinflammatory cytokine (IL-12 p70, TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b) production in HBHA-treated WT, TLR2/, or TLR4/ DCs. The
expression of surface molecules (Fig. 2E) and proinflammatory
cytokine secretion (Fig. 2F) were enhanced in WT or TLR2/
DCs by HBHA. In contrast, these effects were strongly diminished in TLR4/ DCs indicating that HBHA is an agonist for
TLR4 in DCs.
TLR4 signals via the MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways
(26). To investigate the importance of the MyD88- and TRIFdependent pathways in HBHA-induced cytokine production
by DCs, we compared DC-based cytokine production in WT,
MyD88/ and TRIF-deficient mice. HBHA-induced production of IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a was significantly reduced in the
absence of MyD88 and TRIF (Fig. 2G). Our results suggest that
MyD88 and TRIF are crucial for an optimal HBHA-induced
cytokine response. Furthermore, proteinase K- or heat-treated
HBHA lost its activity to stimulate IL-1b production in DCs.
However, HBHA was resistant to polymyxin B treatment,
indicating that LPS contamination was not responsible for
the observed effects (Supplementary Fig. 2).
TLR9 signaling is not required for HBHA-induced DC
activation
TLR activation and signal transduction such as TLRs1, 2, 4,
5, and 6 are modulated by subcellular compartmentalization
of receptors and downstream signaling components (27), and
the intracellular localization of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs such
as TLRs3, 7, and 9 appears to facilitate self versus nonself
discrimination (28). Recent study has suggested that DNA
derived from M. tuberculosis induces proinflammatory cytokines via TLR9-dependent pathway in macrophages and DCs
(29). Thus, we decided to determine whether TLR9 affected to
the HBHA-induced DC maturation. We showed that HBHA
did not bind to TLR9/ DC (Fig. 3A) and TLR9 deficiencies
had no effect on the level of surface molecules (Fig. 3B) and
proinflammatory cytokines (Fig. 3C). These results provided
the evidence that HBHA is an efficient TLR4 agonist.
HBHA enhances DC migration
To investigate whether HBHA affects DC migration, we
measured the CCR7 expression in DCs. The CCR7 expression
was upregulated in HBHA-treated DCs, similar to the level of
LPS-treated DCs (Fig. 4A). Next, we analyzed the migratory
capacity of DCs using a transwell migration assay chamber.
HBHA increased the migratory capacity of DCs in response to
CCL19 in vitro (Fig. 4B).
We also observed an increase in the number of CFSEpositive HBHA-treated DCs in the draining LN compared to
that of CFSE-positive HBHA-untreated DCs in vivo (Fig. 4C).
The migratory capacity of HBHA was further analyzed by

HBHA induces the activation of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells
through TLR4-mediated DC activation
To precisely characterize HBHA activity on the interaction
between DCs and T cells, we performed a syngeneic MLR assay

using OT-I T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic CD8þ T cells,
which express a TCR specific for the MHC class I-restricted
OVA peptide 257–264 Ag (OVA257–264) in DCs (30). HBHAtreated DCs pulsed with OVA257–264 elevated the cluster
formation compared to untreated control DCs pulsed with
OVA257–264 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Additionally, transgenic
CFSE-labeled OVA-specific CD8þ T cells co-cultured with
HBHA-treated DCs pulsed with OVA257–264 proliferated to a
greater extent than did T cells co-cultured with untreated DCs
pulsed with OVA257–264 (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate
that HBHA is a potent immunostimulator for T cells through
DC activation. We then investigated the IFN-g production in

CD4þ and CD8þ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results
suggest that HBHA directs T-cell differentiation toward a Th1
phenotype by inducing IL-12 production.
To test the capacity of HBHA to induce the interaction
between DCs and T cells via TLR4, we performed a syngenic
MLR assay using OT-I and OT-II TCR transgenic CD4þ and
CD8þ T cells. HBHA-treated DCs derived from WT, TLR2/,
and TLR4/ mice pulsed with OVA257–264 or OVA323–339 and
then co-cultured with transgenic CFSE-labeled OVA-specific
CD8þ and CD4þ T cells. The proliferation of OT-I (Fig. 5D)
and OT-II (Fig. 5E) cells were enhanced in HBHA- or LPStreated WT and TLR2/ DCs pulsed with OVA peptide,
whereas there effects were diminished in HBHA- or LPStreated TLR4/ DCs pulsed with OVA peptide indicating
that HBHA induce T-cell proliferation through TLR4mediated DC activation.
HBHA enhances the antitumor efficacy
To show the therapeutic antitumor potential of HBHA, we
used a murine tumor model in which EL4 or OVA-expressing
E.G7 cells were implanted. On day 35 days following E.G7
tumor implantation, injection of DCs pulsed with OVA257–264

(mean size, 19,202.8 [277.4] mm3) or DCs alone (mean size,
16,949.4 [208.2] mm3; P < 0.01). Meanwhile, injection of OVApulsed DCs did not affect the EL4 tumor growth (Data not
shown). Interestingly, E.G7 tumors in mice that received
HBHA-treated DCs pulsed with OVA257–264 were significantly
smaller (mean size, 2,925.7 [60.1] mm3) than that in mice
received DCs pulsed with OVA (Fig. 6A). Notably, only 20% of
mice injected with OVA-pulsed DCs survived beyond 60 days
following E.G7 tumor implantation as compared to over 50%
survival of mice injected with HBHA-treated OVA-pulsed DCs.
In contrast, all mice in the PBS and HBHA-untreated DCsinjected groups had a median survival of 34 days with no longterm survivors (Fig. 6B).
To test the engagement of TLR4 in the retardation of tumor
growth by immunization with HBHA-treated DCs pulsed with

injection of HBHA-DC(TLR4 KO)-OVA (mean size, 16,115.9

To further investigate the mechanism of tumor protection
after HBHA-treated DC vaccination, we first sought to determine whether a humoral antitumor immune response was
induced. Serum from E.G7 tumor implanted mice was collected

injected with a mixture of syngeneic splenocytes pulsed with
OVA257–264 (CFSEhi) or without OVA257–264 (CFSElow), and the
elimination of OVA-pulsed splenocytes (CFSEhi) was examined by flow cytometry.
In addition, a significantly high level of target cell lysis was
observed in mice received HBHA-DC-OVA (79.3 [0.68]%)

HBHA could be an important element in a cancer vaccine
against OVA positive thymoma tumor by inducing killing
activity to target cells.
To assess whether the lymphocytes induced by the HBHAtreated DCs pulsed with OVA257–264 is able to produce the
essential cytokine, we observed significantly higher levels of
IFN-g and IL-2 secretion when splenocytes from mice injected
with HBHA-treated DCs pulsed OVA257–264 (HBHA-DC-OVA)

(TLR4 KO)-OVA was significantly suppressed compared to
mice received HBHA-DC(WT)-OVA (Fig. 7C). This data
suggest that HBHA can modulate the CTL activity via
TLR4-dependent pathway.
To further delineate the mechanism by which OVA-specific
DC vaccination resulted in improved tumor retardation, we
analyzed surface expression of CD62L and CD44, both of
which have been implicated in cell migration to the site of
Ag deposition (31), on CD8þ T cells in spleen. Using flow
cytometry, we identified naive (CD62LhighCD44low) and effector/memory cells (CD62LlowCD44high). By day 7 after final
immunization with HBHA-treated DCs-pulsed with OVA,
CD8þ T cells in spleen showed significantly downregulated
CD62L and upregulated CD44 expression when immunized
with DCs pulsed with OVA (Fig. 7D).

Discussion
The immune system can recognize many tumor Ags however, the ability of tumors to evade the immune system
suggests that host defense mechanism cannot effectively
prevent some tumors. In an attempt to boost the antitumor

immunity, we focused on a DC-based antitumor immunotherapy using HBHA as an adjuvant.
DCs are the most potent APCs and versatile regulators of T
lymphocyte responses (32, 33). Immature DCs capture Ags,
process them into peptides, and present on the cell surface in
association with MHC class I or II to prime CD8þ CTLs or
CD4þ Th1 cells, respectively (32, 33). Immunization with ex
vivo tumor Ag-loaded DCs is a promising tool for eliciting
efficient antitumor immunity (34). This approach has been
successfully used to vaccinate mice and to activate CTL

In this study, we identified the novel properties of HBHA
that HBHA can induce DC maturation via TLR4 activation.
Importantly, HBHA improved the efficacy of the DC-based
antitumor immunotherapy in mice by acting as an adjuvant.
The evidence for these novel characteristics of HBHA includes:
(1) increased expression of surface molecules and proinflammatory cytokines in HBHA-treated DCs; (2) reduced HBHAinduced DC activation in TLR4/ DCs but not in TLR2/
DCs; (3) increased migratory capacity of HBHA-treated DCs;
and (4) significantly elevated OVA-specific CTL activity and
suppression of tumor growth.

M. tuberculosis HBHA for Cancer Vaccines

We showed that the interaction of HBHA with DCs
inhibits the endocytic ability of DCs and induces the
increased expression of surface molecules. Furthermore,
HBHA-treated DCs enhanced primary syngeneic T-cell proliferation more efficiently than untreated DCs. HBHA-treated DCs also triggered the secretion of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12p70,
and TNF-a. Because IL-12 is essential for Th1 polarization
(39) HBHA might promote Th1 immune responses. Furthermore, HBHA-treated DCs triggered the IFN-g production in
CD4þ and CD8þ T cells, which is another feature of Th1
responses. These findings indicate that the antitumor effect
of HBHA-treated DCs is closely related to the increased
production of IFN-g.
In addition, to investigate the adjuvant activity of HBHA, we
administered the model adjuvant OVA alone or in combination with HBHA. It is well documented that the type of IgG
subclass reflects the pattern of immune responses in mice:
IgG2a for Th1 and IgG1 for Th2 (40). OVA alone significantly
enhanced IgG1 responses (Supplementary Fig. 6). Interestingly, however, HBHA dramatically augmented IgG2a (Th1associated) but not IgG1 (Th2-associated) responses to OVA.
Thus, HBHA is a potent adjuvant triggering Th1-mediated
humoral immune responses.
In addition, HBHA induced the CCR7 expression, which is
critical for the migration of DCs from the periphery to
T-cell–rich regions of secondary lymphoid organs (41, 42).
Importantly, HBHA enhanced the migration of DCs toward
CCL19 in vitro and resulted in the draining of LNs in vivo.
HBHA has multiple effects on DC function, indicating that it
can be an effective adjuvant for DC-based antitumor immunotherapies.
TLRs are expressed by many immune cells and play a key
role in innate and adaptive immune responses (43). TLR4
agonists have important immunoregulatory applications, such
as adjuvants for vaccines in antitumor therapies (44). Moreover, adjuvant studies for cancer treatment have recently been
focused on TLR4 agonist because the signal through these
receptors are mediated by either MyD88- and TRIF-dependent
pathway and appear to be especially powerful immunopotentiators (45). Although LPS, the most studied and well-characterized TLR4 agonist, showed highly effective adjuvancity in
both experimental and clinical setting (46), it is not suitable

for clinical use due to its toxicity in humans. Thus, novel TLR4
agonists will be extremely beneficial as vaccine adjuvants in
antitumor therapy.
Some M. tuberculosis proteins have a significant immunostimulatory potential. Both TLR2 and TLR4 mediate M.
tuberculosis-induced intracellular signaling in APCs (47).
Furthermore, several molecules from M. tuberculosis have
now been identified as TLR2 agonists and are known to
induce APC activation (48, 49). However, TLR4 agonists
have not yet been identified. We showed that HBHA
directly binds TLR4 and activates TLR4-mediated MyD88
and TRIF signaling, leading to the expression of surface
molecules and proinflammatory cytokines’ production by
DCs (Fig. 2).
On the basis of the results described herein, we suggest that
HBHA could be used for DC-based antitumor immunotherapies. It is obvious that immunotherapy using HBHA for tumor
treatment has not yet been explored in detail including safety
issue. However, because of its ability to stimulate DCs, which
then further activate T cells that are able to lyse tumor cells
and suppress tumor growth, we propose HBHA as a novel and
potent adjuvant with potential applications in antitumor
immunotherapy.
