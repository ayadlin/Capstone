Abstract:

STAT transcription factors transduce signals from the cell surface to the nucleus,
where they regulate the expression of genes that control proliferation, survival, selfrenewal, and other critical cellular functions. Under normal physiological conditions,
the activation of STATs is tightly regulated. In cancer, by contrast, STAT proteins,
particularly STAT3 and STAT5, become activated constitutively, thereby driving the
malignant phenotype of cancer cells. Since these proteins are largely dispensable
in the function of normal adult cells, STATs represent a potentially important target
for cancer therapy. Although transcription factors have traditionally been viewed
as suboptimal targets for pharmacological inhibition, chemical biology approaches
have been particularly fruitful in identifying compounds that can modulate this
pathway through a variety of mechanisms. STAT inhibitors have notable anti-cancer
effects in many tumor systems, show synergy with other therapeutic modalities,
and have the potential to eradicate tumor stem cells. Furthermore, STAT inhibitors
identified through the screening of chemical libraries can then be employed in
large scale analyses such as gene expression profiling, RNA interference screens,
or large-scale tumor cell line profiling. Data derived from these studies can then
provide key insights into mechanisms of STAT signal transduction, as well as
inform the rational design of targeted therapeutic strategies for cancer patients.

Introduction

transcription of genes involved in key cellular processes
such as survival and proliferation. Under physiological
conditions, STATs are activated rapidly and transiently,
reaching peak phosphorylation within minutes, and
becoming dephosphorylated within one or two hours.
However, in a wide range of human cancers, STATs,
particularly STAT3 and STAT5, become activated
constitutively, thereby driving increased expression of
genes that directly lead to malignant cellular behavior
[2]. Although STATs are critical for the pathogenesis of
these tumors, they are largely dispensable in normal adult
cells, suggesting that they would be targets with a high
therapeutic index. Though transcription factors have not
traditionally been thought of as druggable targets, the
wide variety of cancers that depend on STATs for survival

The goal of research in cancer therapy is to
develop treatments that specifically target the cancer
cell while leaving normal cells intact. As basic scientific
studies elucidate signaling pathways that are activated
inappropriately in tumors and drive their pathogenesis,
new therapeutic targets are emerging. One such pathway
is the signal transducer activator of transcription (STAT)
pathway, which allows extracellular cues to modulate
gene expression [1]. Through the action of a variety
of tyrosine kinases, STATs in the cytoplasm become
phosphorylated on a critical tyrosine residue, thereby
leading to an activating dimerization. These STAT
dimers then enter the nucleus where they can modulate

therapy.

activation. Nifuroxazide has a particularly strong effect
at reducing the viability of MM cells overexpressing
CKS1B, which is associated with poor prognosis in MM
patients and which is associated with enhanced STAT3
activation [4]. Therefore, using a non-biased approach,
we have identified nifuroxazide as a STAT3 inhibitor that
may be useful as a treatment for patients with MM.
This screen also identified the anti-parasitic drug
pyrimethamine, which is approved in the United States
for the treatment of toxoplasmosis and malaria, as being
an effective STAT3 inhibitor. Pyrimethamine displays
significant activity in vitro against multiple myeloma cell
lines characterized by activation of STAT3 (Figure 1).
However, it has little effect on myeloma cell lines lacking
STAT3 activation, or on peripheral blood mononuclear

Chemical biology approaches to
developing STAT inhibitors
To elucidate novel pharmacological strategies
to modulate STAT-dependent gene expression, we
developed a non-biased screen to identify compounds that
could target any part of the STAT transcriptional pathway
[3]. For this chemical biology approach, we generated a
series of cell lines in which a luciferase reporter gene is
under the inducible control of a single transcription factor.
We then used these cell lines to screen diverse chemical

Figure 1: Pyrimethamine reduces the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines containing activated STAT3. Cells were
incubated with the indicated concentrations of pyrimethamine for 48 hours, after which the relative number of viable cells was measured
using an ATP-dependent luminescence assay. Multiple myeloma cell lines containing activated STAT3 (U266 and INA6) or lacking
activated STAT3 (H929 and RPMI 8226) were tested, as were peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) harvested from healthy donors.
libraries to identify compounds that could specifically
block the function of a STAT family member. One could
then deconvolute the mechanism by which the identified
compounds mediated their effect, and this could reveal
unappreciated targets for pharmacological intervention.
We then took two parallel approaches for compound
screening. We interrogated large diverse libraries
comprised of approximately 200,000 compounds. In
addition, to accelerate the development of proof-ofconcept clinical trials, we also screened libraries of drugs
that were already known to be safe in humans. Using this
approach, we identified nifuroxazide, which is approved
in several countries for the treatment of diarrhea, as an
inhibitor of STAT3. Nifuroxazide decreases STAT3
tyrosine phosphorylation, and appears to do so by
inhibiting Jak family tyrosine kinases, including Jak2
and Tyk2. Reflecting the importance of this pathway in
multiple myeloma (MM), nifuroxazide selectively reduces
the viability of MM cells that contain constitutive STAT3
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells (PBMC) harvested from healthy donors, which also
lack STAT3 activation. Pyrimethamine exerts at least some
of its anti-microbial effects as an inhibitor of dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR). However, this is unlikely to be the sole
mechanism for its effect on STAT3 signaling, as other
DHFR inhibitors, such as methotrexate, did not show
activity in this screen.

STAT5 inhibition in CML: Pimozide
A third STAT inhibitor that we identified using
this approach is the psychotropic drug pimozide, which
is approved in the United States for treating Tourette’s
syndrome [5]. This drug inhibits STAT5 function, and
thus we performed our initial characterization in a disease
in which the pathogenesis is dependent on constitutive
STAT5 activation, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
CML is characterized by the essentially uniform finding
519

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 518 - 524

of a chromosomal translocation between chromosomes
9 and 22 yielding a fusion kinase BCR/ABL [6, 7].
Although the introduction of kinase inhibitors such as
imatinib mesylate has revolutionized the treatment of
this disease, several clinical challenges persist [8]. Some
patients cannot tolerate the side effects from kinase
inhibitors [9], and in others mutations arise in BCR/ABL
rendering it resistant to the effect of kinase inhibitors
[10]. In addition, kinase inhibitors do not eradicate the
leukemic stem cell, and thus patients need to take these
drugs indefinitely [11]. We found that pimozide inhibits
the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in CML cells,
raising the possibility that it may be a BCR/ABL inhibitor.
However, several lines of evidence have suggested that
this is not the case. First, there is no consistent loss of
BCR/ABL autophosphorylation at concentrations that
lead to STAT5 inhibition. Second, though the BCR/ABL
inhibitor imatinib leads to a reduction in total cellular
tyrosine phosphorylation, pimozide does not affect the
phosphorylation of other substrates. Third, in vitro kinase
assays show no effect of pimozide on BCR/ABL activity.
In addition, BCR/ABL leads to the activation of pathways
other than STAT5 in CML cells. Consequently, BCR/
ABL kinase inhibitors such as imatinib and nilotinib
lead to a reduction in ERK MAP kinase (MAPK)
phosphorylation; pimozide, by contrast, not only fails to
decrease MAPK phosphorylation, but in fact leads to an
increase in MAPK activation. This may be a result of a
loss of expression of STAT5-dependent negative signaling
regulators. Therefore, pimozide likely inhibits STAT5
phosphorylation in a BCR/ABL-independent manner.
The precise mechanism by which pimozide inhibits
STAT5 is unknown, but preliminary studies suggest that
it may alter the activity of negative regulators of STAT5
phosphorylation.
The activation of MAPK in response to pimozide not
only raises mechanistic questions, but it also provides a
therapeutic opportunity. Though the inhibition of STAT5
by pimozide reduces cell survival, it is possible that the
accompanying activation of MAPK by pimozide provides
pro-survival signals to the cell. This raised the possibility
that inhibition of kinases upstream of MAPK might be
particularly beneficial when combined with pimozide.
Treatment of CML cells with the MEK inhibitor UO126
reduces the phosphorylation of MAPK, and this is seen
even in the presence of pimozide. The combination of
pimozide and UO126 leads to an increase in cytotoxicity
when compared to cells treated with either drug alone.
Therefore, dissecting the effects of inhibition of signaling
pathways can provide crucial insights into maximizing the
therapeutic potential of this approach.
If it is true that pimozide is functioning as a STAT5
inhibitor downstream from BCR/ABL, then it would be
expected that pimozide would be equally efficacious in
inhibiting the viability of CML cells even in the presence
of mutations in BCR/ABL that render them resistant to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

kinase inhibitors. Consistent with this possibility, we
found that pimozide showed equal potency towards
CML cells harboring wildtype BCR/ABL and BCR/ABL
containing a T315I mutation which renders it resistant to
all currently approved kinase inhibitors [12]. This effect
may have even broader applicability in treating CML and
other myeloproliferative diseases. In addition to mutations
in BCR/ABL, it has been suggested that mutations in
alternative pathways, such as Jak2, may result in imatinib
resistance through activation of STAT5 [13-15]. A recent
report suggests that the upregulation of STAT5 expression
may also be part of the development of imatinib resistance
[16]. All of these mechanisms require continued STAT5
function, and thus inhibitors of this protein may be able to
overcome resistance in a variety of settings.
One additional effect of STAT5 inhibition emerged
from these experiments. As noted, CML patients need to
take kinase inhibitors indefinitely, presumably because
these drugs do not eradicate the leukemic stem cell. To
address this question, we examined the effect of pimozide
on hematopoietic colony formation in vitro employing
CD34+ cells isolated from the bone marrow of patients
with CML or healthy donors. While pimozide had
minimal effects on the cells from the healthy donors, it
completely abrogated the ability of the cells from the
CML patients to form colonies. This observation raises the
possibility that pimozide or other STAT5 inhibitors, alone
or perhaps in combination with a kinase inhibitor, may
be able to eradicate leukemic stem cells. This is perhaps
not surprising, in that some STAT target genes, such as
BCL6 and KLF4, may play a critical role in maintaining
pluripotency [17-19]. This is further supported by the
finding that STAT3 activation may be a key event in breast
cancer cells with stem cell-like properties [20].

STAT3 and STAT5
pathogenesis

in

cancer

Although STAT3 and STAT5 have similar DNA
binding sites, they have distinct biological roles. For
example, in mammary epithelium, STAT5 is activated
during pregnancy and lactation, while STAT3 is activated
primarily during involution [21]. However, in cancer
pathogenesis there is evidence that STAT3 and STAT5
have similar functions [22]. There are many genes known
to be regulated by both STAT3 and STAT5, including prosurvival and proliferation genes such as Bcl-x, Mcl-1, and
cyclin D1. In leukemias, STAT5 activation upregulates
genes critical for tumor survival, whereas in multiple
myeloma, STAT3 activates the same, or similar genes,
which are critical for the pathogenesis of this tumor
type. In addition, tumors that depend on the constitutive
activation of one STAT may develop resistance to therapy
through activation of another STAT family member. This
can occur through the activation of other tyrosine kinases,
through the autocrine secretion of cytokines, or through
520

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 518 - 524

regulatory pathways, we hypothesized that pimozide
might inhibit STAT3 as well as STAT5. Although there
are some cell type-specific restrictions to its effects,
pimozide readily inhibits STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation
in a number of systems, including the multiple myeloma
cell lines INA6 (Figure 2) and U266 (data not shown).
When myeloma cells are incubated with pimozide, there
is a dose dependent loss of viability (data not shown).
Since pimozide and pyrimethamine inhibit STAT3
through distinct mechanisms, we reasoned that they may
show a beneficial effect when combined. Various dose
combinations of these drugs show enhanced effects on
cell viability when compared to either drug alone (Figure
3). This raises the possibility that simultaneously blocking
STAT activation at two distinct steps may be a particularly
effective form of therapy, and potentially less likely to
allow the generation of resistance.

Figure 2: Pimozide reduces STAT3 tyrosine
phosphorylation in multiple myeloma cells. INA6

myeloma cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations
of pimozide for three hours, after which whole cell lysates were
analyzed by immunoblot for tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3
and total STAT3.

Leveraging the findings from
cell-based screens
Having identified compounds that inhibit STATs,
it then becomes possible to use these as probes to gain
insight into the mechanisms of STAT signaling, identify
specific targets for therapeutic intervention, and isolate
even more effective drugs for therapeutic development.

Gene expression profiling: The Connectivity Map
Although screening large numbers of compounds in
a cell-based assay can rapidly identify a number of active
STAT inhibitors, it can be a challenge to identify the
mechanism by which these compounds exert their effect.
One strategy is to identify other drugs whose mechanisms
are better understood, and which exert similar actions.
One approach to accomplish this is to obtain gene
expression signatures from cells treated with a drug, and
then to interrogate the Connectivity Map, a large database
containing gene expression data derived from cells treated
with over 1000 drugs [25]. This may identify other STAT
inhibitors, which themselves may be useful for cancer
therapy, and it may also help to clarify the mechanism
of action of these drugs. It is also possible to use gene
expression signatures of activated STAT3 to identify
drugs that induce an inverse of this pattern as another
computational strategy to identify STAT3 inhibitors.

Figure 3: Myeloma cell viability is reduced when treated
with the combination of pimozide and pyrimethamine.

luminescence assay.

soluble or other signals derived from other cells, such as
those found in the bone marrow stroma [13-15, 23]. For
example, BCR/ABL activates STAT5 in the CML cell line
K562, but when these cells are co-cultured with stromal
cells, STAT3 is activated [24]. This activation of STAT3
is correlated with resistance to the BCR/ABL inhibitors
imatinib and nilotinib. Treatment of K562 cells with
imatinib leads to an inhibition of STAT5 activation and
a reduction in STAT5 target gene expression. However,
K562 cells co-cultured with stromal cells continue to
express these STAT target genes. Furthermore, reducing
STAT3 levels with siRNA reversed the imatinib resistance
seen under the co-culture conditions. Therefore, it is
likely that STAT3 and STAT5 can both be oncogenic by
regulating the expression of critical target genes. This also
suggests that STAT inhibitors may be useful as therapeutic
agents in cells that contain activation of either STAT3 or
STAT5, or both.
Since STAT3 and STAT5 share overlapping

RNA interference screening
A second large-scale approach to understand STAT
signaling more clearly and elucidate the mechanism of
action of newly identified STAT inhibitors is to use siRNAbased screens in conjunction with the luciferase reporter
cell lines described above. This approach can identify gene
products that modulate STAT signaling, and may reveal
521

hitherto unknown ways in which STAT signaling can be
affected by other cellular pathways. RNA interferencebased screens can also be combined with newly identified
STAT inhibitors to identify gene products that either
abrogate the effect of the drugs, or which potentiate their
effect. This strategy can help identify the direct cellular
targets of these compounds, which may allow more
traditional drug development approaches to be applied to
them. In addition, the identification of pathways that may
synergize with these STAT inhibitors can immediately
suggest potentially synergistic therapeutic strategies that
can be developed.

particular effective against cell lines from non-small cell
lung cancers and skin cancers (principally melanoma),
while pimozide showed preferential effectiveness against
tumors from skin, esophagus, and head and neck, among
others (Figure 4 and data not shown). All of these tumors
have been reported to have frequent activation of STAT3,
and these findings support a common final target of
these drugs [28-30]. However, the sensitivities were not
superimposable, suggesting that there are drug-specific
effects as well.
Since these cell lines have been genetically
characterized, they can provide other clues regarding the
effects of these drugs. For example, activating mutations in
BRAF have been found to occur commonly in melanoma
[31], and pimozide is more effective in tumors containing
this mutation. Just as pimozide shows enhanced efficacy
in CML when combined with BCR/ABL inhibitors,
pimozide may be particularly useful in melanoma when
combined with BRAF inhibitors [32, 33]. In addition,
pimozide appears to be more effective in tumors that
contain wildtype p53, which raises both mechanistic
questions regarding STAT3 inhibitors in general and
these drugs in particular. These findings also suggest
potential therapeutic strategies that could be employed
to optimize the effects of these agents clinically. Thus,
the identification of targeted STAT inhibitors through
chemical biology processes can be leveraged by these
additional large-scale analyses.

Large scale cell line-based efficacy screens
Given that STAT3 is known to be activated in a wide
spectrum of human tumors, another strategy to evaluate the
potential of STAT inhibitors is to determine their activity
on a large panel of highly annotated cancer cell lines [26,
27]. This approach can rapidly generate information on the
activity of individual compounds against cell lines derived
from particular tumor types, allows for analyses based
on the genotype of cell lines, and provides a comparison
of the activity of distinct STAT inhibitors evaluated
through such a screen. Using a high throughput system,
we screened over 600 adherent cells lines for sensitivity
to pyrimethamine and pimozide. Importantly, not all the
cell lines were sensitive to these drugs, confirming that
they are not generally cytotoxic. Pyrimethamine was

Figure 4: High throughput cell line profiling reveals distinct tumor type sensitivity to pyrimethamine. 684 human cancer
cell lines were screened for the growth inhibitory effects of pyrimethamine, tested at three different concentrations, using previously
described methods [26]. The tumor type enrichment algorithm indicates cell lines derived from different tumor types that show preferential
sensitivity to pyrimethamine. 27% of the cell lines tested (vertical red line) were sensitive to pyrimethamine (defined as greater than
80% killing at 10 μ M). As a threshold for activity, greater than eight distinct cell lines of a particular tumor type had to show sensitivity
to pyrimethamine (horizontal blue line). Tumor types in the top right hand quadrant are significantly more sensitive to the drug and are
indicated by red filled circles.

inhibitors. Blood. 2011; 117:3421-3429.

Since the identification of the STAT transcription
factor family in the early 1990s, abundant evidence has
linked the inappropriate activation of these proteins with
cancer pathogenesis. Given that these proteins may be
relatively dispensable in mature cells, they represent
targets with the potential of having a high therapeutic
index. Although transcription factors have traditionally
been viewed as difficult targets for pharmacological
inhibition, chemical biology approaches have been
useful in identifying compounds that can specifically
inhibit these proteins through a variety of mechanisms.
Furthermore, large scale strategies based on gene
expression analysis, RNA interference, and cytotoxicity
assays can then provide additional information related to
both basic questions in STAT signal transduction, as well
as the development of rational therapeutic strategies for
cancer patients.
