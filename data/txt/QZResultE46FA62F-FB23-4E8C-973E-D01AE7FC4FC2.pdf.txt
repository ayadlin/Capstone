Abstract
Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm in children
characterized by the overproduction of monocytic cells that inﬁltrate the spleen, lung, and liver. JMML
remains a disease for which few curative therapies are available other than myeloablative hematopoietic stem
cell transplant (HSCT); however, relapse remains a major cause of treatment failure and the long-term
morbidities of HSCT for survivors are substantial. A hallmark feature of JMML is acquired hypersensitivity by
clonal myeloid progenitor cells to granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) via a largely
unknown mechanism. Here, we identify c-Cbl (henceforth referred to as Cbl) as a GM-CSF receptor (GMR)
adaptor protein that targets Src for ubiquitin-mediated destruction upon GM-CSF stimulation and show that
a loss of negative regulation of Src is pivotal in the hyperactivation of GMR signaling in Cbl-mutated JMML
cells. Notably, dasatinib, an U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved multikinase inhibitor that also
targets Src family, dramatically attenuated the spontaneous and GM-CSF-induced hypersensitive growth
phenotype of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and bone marrow collected from JMML patients
harboring Cbl or other known JMML-associated mutations. These ﬁndings reveal Src kinase as a critical
oncogenic driver underlying JMML. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2540–50. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The majority of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)–
associated mutations have been mapped to genes that encode
proteins that signal through the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, including NF1, NRAS, KRAS, and
PTPN11 (SHP2), which account for approximately 75% of JMML
patients (1). Recently, we identiﬁed Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma (CBL) mutations that were reduced to homozygosity in
leukemic cells as a result of acquired isodisomy in approximately 10–15% of children with JMML (2, 3), thereby establishing CBL as a new JMML tumor suppressor gene. Importantly,
CBL mutations in JMML patient samples were mutually exclusive with respect to other Ras pathway-associated mutations
but nevertheless displayed the classic granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) hypersensitivity

phenotype, which suggests a possible convergence of Cbl and
Ras signaling pathways. Consistent with this notion, CBL
mutations have been conﬁrmed in other Ras-related disorder,
Noonan syndrome (4), as well as in myelodysplastic syndromes, atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia and chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia, diseases that primarily occur in
adults that share some clinical and molecular features with
JMML (5–7).
Cbl is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitylates
receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (8). Cbl contains a
highly conserved N-terminal tyrosine kinase-binding (TKB)
domain that mediates interaction between Cbl and phosphorylated tyrosines on activated receptor tyrosine kinases such as
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ref. 9), plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR; ref. 10) and c-Kit
(11), as well as non-receptor tyrosine kinases JAK2, ZAP-70,
and Syk (12). The RING ﬁnger is separated from the TKB
domain by an alpha helical structure known as the linker
region, which is critical for the regulation of E3 function
(13). Crystallographic study has revealed that the linker region
contacts the TKB domain, the RING ﬁnger, and the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (14). Y371 within the linker region
becomes phosphorylated upon interaction with tyrosine
kinases such as EGFR and insulin receptor, leading to conformational change in Cbl and activation of its E3 activity (13).
Moreover, C-terminal to the RING ﬁnger is a proline-rich
domain that mediates interaction with SH3-containing and
SH2 proteins such as the p85 subunit of PI3K (15). Notably,
although Cbl's E3 function serves as a negative regulator of
signaling, its role as an adaptor molecule potentiates signal

transduction (13). We and others have recently showed that
JMML-associated CBL mutations, including the most common
Y371H substitution, result in the loss of E3 function (3, 7).
Although these studies have provided important insights into
the possible consequences of CBL mutations, the mechanisms
responsible for the GM-CSF hypersensitivity phenotype invariably displayed by JMML progenitor cells remains largely
unknown.

Cell Signalling Technologies. Antibodies against GMRa,
GMRbc (monoclonal and polyclonal), Cbl (monoclonal), and
polyclonal extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibodies against HA (12CA5), pTYR (4G10), and ubiquitin were
obtained from Boehringer Ingelheim, Millipore, and Dako,
respectively. Monoclonal b-actin and pERK antibodies were
obtained from Sigma.

Materials and Methods

Plasmids
Plasmids encoding pDEST4.0-HA-Cbl (WT, Y371H, 70Z)
were generated as previously described (3). pSG5-GMRa and
pSG5-GMRBc constructs were also generously provided by Dr.
Tim Hercus. All constructs were veriﬁed by direct DNA
sequencing.

Cells
HEK293 and TF-1 cells were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection. HEK293 cells were maintained in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Wisent) at 37 C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 atmosphere. TF1 cells were maintained similarly in RPMI-1640 (Wisent)
medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 ng/ml GM-CSF
(Invitrogen).
Retroviral production and BaF3-GMR cell generation
GM-receptor a (GMRa) and GMRbc were subcloned into
pRUFneo:IRES retroviral expression system (pRUFneo:IRESGMRa/bc) and cotransfected with pEQEco packaging plasmid
(both generous gifts from Dr. Tim Hercus; Centre for Cancer
Biology, Adelaide, Australia) into HEK293 cells. The media was
replaced with fresh media the next day. Viral supernatant was
harvested 2 and 3 days posttransfection and passed through a
0.45 mm ﬁlter (Pall). BaF3-HA-Cbl (WT, Y371H, 70Z) cells were
generated as previously described (6), maintained in RPMI1640 with 10% FBS, 10 mg/mL mIL-3 (R&D), 10 ng/mL puromycin (Sigma), and transduced with RUFneo:IRES-GMRa/bc
retrovirus with polybrene (Millipore). Cell populations
stably expressing GMR were established using G418 resistance
(Sigma) and conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis. These
BaF3-GMR-HA-Cbl (WT, Y371H, 70Z) cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS, 2 ng/mL GM-CSF,
10 ng/mL puromycin, and 0.25 mg/mL G418.
Generation of shCbl and ShLyn cell lines
TF-1-shCbl and TF-1-shScr cells were generated using
SMARTvector 2.0 Lentiviral shRNA particles targeted against
human Cbl (Dharmacon). Cell populations with stable Cbl
knockdown were selected with puromycin, sorted on a FACS
Aria (BD Biosciences) and further conﬁrmed by Western blot
analysis. The stable cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640
medium with 10% FBS, 2 ng/mL GM-CSF, and 10 ng/mL
puromycin. BaF3-GMR-HA-Cbl(Y371H)-ShLyn and -shScr cells
were generated using mouse lentiviral shRNA directed against
Lyn kinase obtained from Dr. Jason Moffat (Donnelly Centre for
Cellular and Biomolecular Research, University of Toronto,
Toronto, Ontario, Canada).
Antibodies
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Cbl, pCblY774, Lyn, Src,
phosphorylated (p)Src(Y416) as well as Src phosphorylated on
Y527, JAK2, pJAK2, pSTAT5, and STAT5 were obtained from

www.aacrjournals.org

Src knockdown via siRNA
Endogenous Src in HEK293 cells was silenced using ONTARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were done as
described previously (16).
Chemicals
Dasatinib, cycloheximide, AG490, and PP2 were obtained
from Sigma. MG132 was obtained from Peptides International.
Primary patient studies
Sample collection. Bone marrow or peripheral blood
samples were collected from children suspected of having
JMML. The UCSF Committee on Human Research approved
this study. All samples were obtained with informed consent.
Mononuclear cells were isolated according to standard
procedures. Genomic DNA was isolated using Puregene
reagents (Qiagen). Patients were genotyped for mutations
in PTPN11 exons 3 and 13, NRAS/KRAS exons 1 and 2, and
CBL exons 8 and 9 according to previously reported methods
(2, 17–19).
Human hematopoietic progenitor assays. In CFU-GM
assays, mononuclear cells from peripheral blood or bone
marrow were plated in MethoCult H4230 (StemCell Technologies) and supplemented with recombinant human GMCSF (Peprotech). Colonies were counted after 14 days,
as previously described (20). For CFU-GM assays in which
cells were exposed to dasatinib (LC Laboratories) or imatinib
(LC Laboratories), inhibitor was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and directly added to the MethoCult before
plating.
Western blots. Mononuclear cells were rested for 30 minutes in Iscove's Modiﬁed Dulbecco's Medium and 1% bovine
serum albumin followed by exposure to inhibitor for 30 minutes. Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/mL recombinant
human GM-CSF (Peprotech) for 15 minutes. Resting, inhibitor
exposure, and stimulation were all done at 37 C, 5% CO2.
Whole lysates were prepared, resolved on SDS-PAGE and

phosphorylate GMRbc (22). Activated GMR serves as a docking
site for adaptors and signaling molecules resulting in activation of downstream signaling, including the ERK pathway (23).
However, the role of Cbl in GMR-mediated signaling has been
unexplored.
To begin addressing this question, we ﬁrst asked whether
phosphorylation of Cbl is associated with GMR activation. GMCSF treatment of serum-starved human myeloid TF-1 cells,
which are dependent on GM-CSF for growth and survival (24),
promoted phosphorylation of endogenous Cbl in a manner
temporally similar to the phosphorylation pattern of GMRbc
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1). Importantly, endogenous
Cbl coprecipitated with endogenous GMRbc and GMRa in the
presence of GM-CSF in TF-1 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown).
In addition, murine pro-B BaF3 cells, which were previously
transduced with shRNA against endogenous murine Cbl (3),

immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies as previously
described (20).
Statistical analyses
Unpaired 2-tailed Student t test was used to compare
between treatment groups and cell types. All statistical analysis
was done using GraphPad PRISM 5.0 software. Statistical
signiﬁcance was achieved at the conﬁdence limit indicated.

Results
GMR is composed of a ligand-speciﬁc a chain (GMRa) and
the b common (GMRbc) signaling subunit, which is shared
with the IL-3 and IL-5 receptors (21). Upon binding of GM-CSF
to GMRa, a higher-order signaling complex is formed that
promotes the activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases JAK2
and Src family kinases c-Src and Lyn, which subsequently

even in the absence of GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 2A). Following
GM-CSF stimulation, expression of HA-Cbl(Y371H) promoted
GMRbc hyper-phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). These results suggest

Deregulated Src Underlies JMML

hypersensitive GM-CSF phenotype previously reported for
JMML progenitors with the Cbl(Y371H) mutation (3), BaF3GMR-Cbl(Y371H) cells displayed elevated STAT5 and ERK
phosphorylation upon exposure to a range of GM-CSF concentrations compared to BaF3-GMR-Cbl(WT) cells (Fig. 2B).
Perhaps most importantly, the basal as well as GM-CSF–
stimulated Src phosphorylation on Y416, representing activated Src (25), were markedly increased in BaF3-GMR-Cbl(Y371H)
cells (Fig. 2B).
Yokuchi and colleagues (26) previously showed that Src
phosphorylates Cbl, which triggers its E3 ligase function,
including ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Src as a negative feedback. We previously showed that the loss of E3
activity prolonged the turnover rate of Cbl(Y371H) because
of a failure in ubiquitin-mediated autodestruction (3).
Therefore, we asked whether the loss of E3 activity via the
acquisition of Y371H mutation results in the loss of negative
regulation of Src and the perpetuation of Cbl(Y371H) and Src
activation in the context of GMR signaling. GM-CSF treatment of serum/cytokine-starved TF-1 cells enhanced Src
phosphorylation and its interaction to endogenous Cbl (Fig.
3A, left). In particular, Lyn, the predominant Src kinase
expressed in myeloid cells (27) shown previously to mediate
GMPbc receptor activation and subsequent signaling (22),
bound Cbl preferentially in the presence of GM-CSF (Fig. 3A,
right). These results show for the ﬁrst time that Cbl associates with Src, in particular Lyn, in the context of GMR
activation in myeloid cells.
Inhibition of Src activity via a speciﬁc Src kinase inhibitor,
PP2, as well as an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved Abl and Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib,
abolished Src phosphorylation, and dramatically reduced
GM-CSF-induced Cbl and GMRbc phosphorylation (Fig.
3B and C), which support the notion that Src is critical in
regulating the activity of Cbl and GMR following GM-CSF
stimulation. Moreover, endogenous Cbl knockdown in TF-1
cells using CBL-speciﬁc lentivirus-shRNA, but not the nontargeting scrambled lentivirus-shRNA, enhanced Src and
GMRbc phosphorylation, and prolonged Src turnover upon
GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 3D and E). Furthermore, Cbl(WT),
but not Cbl(Y371H), promoted GM-CSF–induced Src ubiquitylation and clearance (Fig. 3F and G). These results
suggest that JMML-associated Y371H mutation abrogates
Cbl-mediated ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of
Src upon GMR activation. In addition, pharmacologic inhibition of Src using dasatinib or PP2 dramatically attenuated
hyper-phosphorylation of Cbl(Y371H) and GMRbc upon GMCSF stimulation (Fig. 4A–D). The heightened phosphorylation of Cbl(Y371H) in the absence of ligand was likewise
abrogated in the presence of dasatinib or PP2 (Fig. 4A, C, and

D). Consistent with these observations, shRNA-mediated
knockdown of Lyn in BaF3-GMR cells markedly attenuated
Cbl(Y371H) phosphorylation, as well as the level of phosphorylated ERK, in the presence or absence of GM-CSF (Fig.
4E). Notably, siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Src in
HEK293 cells not only suppressed Cbl(Y371H) phosphorylation, but also attenuated the association between Cbl
(Y371H) and GMRbc (Fig. 4F and G). It should be noted
that a highly speciﬁc JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, effectively
blocked JAK2 phosphorylation, but did not attenuate Src
phosphorylation and failed to inhibit Cbl(Y371H) hyperphosphorylation upon GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 4C). These
results show that the binding of Cbl to GMRbc as well as
phosphorylation of Cbl upon GMR activation is dependent
on Src, and that JMML-associated Cbl(Y371H) prolongs
hyperactivation of GMR-mediated signaling because of a
failure in the Cbl-mediated negative regulation of Src.
We next exposed freshly isolated mononuclear cells from
peripheral blood and bone marrow collected from multiple
JMML patients with conﬁrmed CBL mutation (or canonical
Ras pathway alteration, including NF1, NRAS, and PTPN11
mutations) to increasing doses of dasatinib in colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) assay (Fig. 5A
and Supplementary Table S1). Notably, dasatinib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets Src family kinases, BCR-ABL,
PDGFRA, and KIT, among others, and is an FDA approved
agent commonly used in the treatment of patients with
BCR/ABL positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or
in combination with chemotherapy in Phþ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Importantly, it is a well-tolerated oral agent
with an established toxicity proﬁle published not only in
adults but also in children (28, 29) and can be administered
as a liquid suspension to young patients incapable of swallowing pills. Strikingly, all tested JMML cells irrespective of
mutational status showed substantial inhibition of spontaneous growth in the presence of dasatinib concentrations as
low as 10 nmol/L, whereas approximately 50% inhibition at
doses of 50 nmol/L or higher was observed in the presence of
saturating GM-CSF (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S2A and
S3A). In addition to the diminution in colony number, the
size of the colonies was also dramatically reduced in the
presence of dasatinib with or without GM-CSF irrespective
of mutational status (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Exposing cells to dasatinib at a concentration achievable in
patients taking the oral drug (150 nmol/L) shifted the GMCSF hypersensitivity curve back to a more normal appearance (Fig. 5C). In primary peripheral blood mononuclear
cells harboring Cbl(Y371H), Cbl intron 8 deletion, PTPN11
(E76V), N-Ras(G12D), or NF1 LOH, dasatinib treatment,
which predictably attenuated phosphorylated (p)Src levels,

C, JMML patient-derived leukemia cells (n ¼ 3, all with CBL mutations) were plated in a CFU-GM hypersensitivity assay with and without dasatinib
(150 nmol/L). Percentage of maximum growth at 10 mmol/L GM-CSF is displayed with and without dasatinib. Error bars represent SEM for these 3 samples.
A paired t test comparing percentage of maximum growth with and without dasatinib at all concentrations was statistically signiﬁcant (2-tailed P  0.0001).
D, primary peripheral mononuclear cells collected from a patient with a Cbl(Y371H) mutation were stimulated with or without GM-CSF in the
presence or absence of dasatinib or imatinib. Cell lysates were then prepared and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. E, primary peripheral
mononuclear cells collected from a JMML patient with a PTPN11(E76V) mutation or with a N-Ras(G12D) mutation were stimulated with or without GM-CSF
in the presence or absence of dasatinib. Cell lysates were then prepared and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.

dramatically reduced pERK levels in the presence of saturating doses of GM-CSF (Fig. 5D and E and Supplementary
Fig. S4). In contrast, imatinib, an Abl-speciﬁc inhibitor that
does not target Src, had no discernable effect on pSrc or
pERK levels or on the hypersensitive colony growth (Fig. 5D
and Supplementary Fig. S3B). These results suggest that
pharmacologic inhibition of Src attenuates GM-CSF hypersensitivity of peripheral blood and bone marrow–derived
primary JMML cells in a dosage-dependent manner.

Discussion
Recently, we and others identiﬁed sporadic and germline
CBL mutations in JMML patients with Y371H mutation
emerging as the most common CBL mutation (3, 7).
Although mutations in Cbl were predicted to result in the
loss of E3 function (3, 7), the molecular mechanism by which
these mutations cause JMML and more precisely the
observed GM-CSF hypersensitivity that underlies JMML
remained unclear. Here, we show that Cbl binds to
ligand-engaged GMR in a Src-dependent manner and targets
Src for ubiquitin-mediated destruction. In comparison to
wild-type Cbl, Cbl(Y371H) exhibited increased afﬁnity for
activated GMR complex and failed to ubiquitylate active Src,
thereby causing accumulation of pSrc. Conformational
change of Cbl structure because of gene mutation likely
altered the binding afﬁnity of Cbl(Y371H) to GMRbc. The
interaction between Cbl and GMRbc is, however, also inﬂuenced by GMR activation in the presence of GM-CSF, which
raises the possibility that the consequential phosphorylation
of Cbl and/or GMRbc promotes their physical association.
Notably, Cbl and GMRbc association and phosphorylation in
the presence of GM-CSF are, at least in part, dependent on
Src. These observations suggest that in addition to gene
mutation-induced conformational changes, Src-dependent
phosphorylation contributes to Cbl binding to GMRbc. Src
has been shown to activate and phosphorylate Cbl on
multiple tyrosine residues, including Y700, 731, and 774,
which promote several signaling cascades (30). Src also
phosphorylates Cbl on Y371 to activate the E3 ligase function of Cbl, which in turn trigger interdependent ubiquitylation and degradation of both proteins (26), a process necessary for terminating downstream signaling postactivation.
Consistent with this notion, the pathological stabilization of
pSrc resulted in Src-dependent hyper-phosphorylation and
concomitant stabilization of Cbl(Y371H) upon GM-CSF
stimulation to accentuate and prolong GMRbc phosphorylation and downstream signaling. These lines of evidence
suggest that the critical loss of negative regulation of Src
upon JMML-causing CBL mutations underlies GM-CSF
hypersensitivity.
Despite the fact that IL-3a and IL-5a also associate with b
common subunit (i.e., GMRbc; ref. 21), JMML cells do not
display hypersensitivity to IL-3 or IL-5. Notably, Src binds to the
ligand-specifying GMRa chain, which upon ligand binding
associates with GMRbc to initiate GMRbc activation via JAK2
and Src (22, 31). However, it is unclear whether IL-3R or IL-5R
directly interacts Src or Cbl and whether the interplay observed
between Cbl and Src on GMR is recapitulated on IL-3/5R. For

example, IL-3 treatment was previously shown to increase the
amount of Grb2 associated with Cbl; however, it did not alter
the level of Fyn (another member of Src kinase family) associated with Cbl (32). Consistent with these uncertainties, IL-3
treatment did not differentially inﬂuence IL-3–mediated signaling in BaF3-Cbl(Y371H) cells in comparison to wild-type
Cbl-expressing BaF3 cells (data not shown). These observations underscore the importance of Src interaction on GMRa
in promoting GM-CSF hypersensitivity observed in cells harboring Cbl(Y371H) mutation.
Perhaps most importantly, dasatinib dramatically attenuated spontaneous and GM-CSF-dependent hypersensitive
growth phenotype of human primary leukemic cells collected from peripheral blood or bone marrow of JMML children
harboring Cbl mutations. Notably, imatinib, an Abl-speciﬁc
inhibitor that does not target Src, had no appreciable effect
on pSrc or pERK levels or on the hypersensitive colony
growth of JMML cells. Intriguingly, dasatinib also reduced
the hypersensitive growth phenotype of JMML cells harboring Ras pathway mutations (see Fig. 5A, E, Supplementary
Fig. 2 and 4), which suggests potential involvement of Src in
non-Cbl mutated JMML cells. Although the connection
between Ras pathway and Src in the context of GMRmediated signaling has not been formally established, a
biochemical link between Src and Ras has been speculated
through the interaction via Raf-1(33). Recently, the expression of oncogenic Ras has been shown to induce c-Src
activation, and elevated Src activity has been observed in
human cancer cell lines that harbor oncogenic Ras mutations (34) as well as in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
that are characterized with a high incidence of oncogenic KRas mutations (35). Interestingly, G proteins are GTPases
that have also been shown to directly activate Src (36). Thus,
it remains to be determined whether oncogeninc Ras, which
is also a GTPase, drives Src activity via Raf-1 or yet-deﬁned
mediator protein(s) to inﬂuence Cbl-dependent GMR signaling. Undeﬁned connection between Ras pathway and Src
notwithstanding, these results suggest that the loss of negative regulation of Src in certain susceptible myeloid progenitor population is central to the GM-CSF hypersensitivity
phenotype invariably observed in JMML patients, and that
Src represents a potential druggable target for the amelioration of the hypersensitive growth phenotype of primary
human JMML cells. Despite the promise of dasatinib, it is a
multi-kinase inhibitor, and hence the future challenge would
be to develop small molecule inhibitors that exclusively
target Src ideally in leukemic progenitors in JMML patients.
