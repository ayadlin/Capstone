Abstract
Inactivation of the LKB1 tumor suppressor is a frequent event in
non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) leading to the activation
of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and sensitivity to the metabolic
stress inducer phenformin. In this study, we explored the combinatorial use of phenformin with the mTOR catalytic kinase inhibitor MLN0128 as a treatment strategy for NSCLC bearing comutations in the LKB1 and KRAS genes. NSCLC is a genetically and
pathologically heterogeneous disease, giving rise to lung tumors of
varying histologies that include adenocarcinomas and squamous
cell carcinomas (SCC). We demonstrate that phenformin in combination with MLN0128 induced a signiﬁcant therapeutic response
in KRAS/LKB1–mutant human cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC that develop both adenocarci-

nomas and SCCs. Speciﬁcally, we found that KRAS/LKB1–
mutant lung adenocarcinomas responded strongly to phenformin þ MLN0128 treatment, but the response of SCCs to single
or combined treatment with MLN0128 was more attenuated
due to acquired resistance to mTOR inhibition through modulation of the AKT-GSK signaling axis. Combinatorial use of the
mTOR inhibitor and AKT inhibitor MK2206 robustly inhibited
the growth and viability of squamous lung tumors, thus providing an effective strategy to overcome resistance. Taken
together, our ﬁndings deﬁne new personalized therapeutic
strategies that may be rapidly translated into clinical use for
the treatment of KRAS/LKB1–mutant adenocarcinomas and
squamous cell tumors. Cancer Res; 75(22); 4910–22. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

mouse models (GEMM) of NSCLC, leading to increased tumor
cell apoptosis, slowing tumor progression, and extending overall
survival. However, phenformin was not curative as a single agent,
underscoring the need to identify additional pathways to combinatorially target.
Loss of LKB1 leads to hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in a
cell autonomous manner thus making mTORC1 an attractive
target to inhibit in LKB1-deﬁcient lung tumors (8). Elevated
mTORC1 activation results in increased expression of targets,
such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1 a and 2 a (HIF1a and HIF2a),
which actively drive cell growth and a glycolytic metabolic signature seen in a variety of human tumors (9–11). In previous
work, we successfully inhibited polyp formation and glucose
metabolism in a Lkb1þ/ model of Peutz Jeghers Syndrome using
the allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, suggesting that inhibition of mTORC1 is a viable strategy to target LKB1/ NSCLC
(10). However, rapamycin as a single agent failed to induce a
therapeutic response in the Kras/Lkb1 mouse model of lung cancer
and rapalogs have demonstrated limited beneﬁt for NSCLC in the
clinic (12, 13). These data suggested the need to evaluate nextgeneration mTOR catalytic kinase inhibitors to target LKB1-deﬁcient lung tumors. MLN0128 is a potent mTOR catalytic kinase
inhibitor that has shown efﬁcacy as an anticancer agent in cell
culture and xenograft models of sarcoma, neuroblastoma, and
pancreatic cancer (14–16) as well as GEMMs of Pten/ prostate
cancer and Myc-driven lymphoma (17, 18). MLN0128 is currently
in clinical trials for treatment of advanced solid tumors and
hematologic malignancies (NCT01351350; NCT01118689). In
this study, we explored the combinatorial use of phenformin
with MLN0128 as a therapeutic strategy to target KRAS/LKB1–
mutant lung tumors.

Currently, there are few effective, targeted therapies for the
treatment of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no effective
strategies for the chemoprevention of lung cancer. Successful
targeted therapies for NSCLC, including inhibitors against EGFR
and ALK-mutant tumors, treat only a subset adenocarcinoma
patients (1, 2), leaving the vast majority of patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) without targeted
therapeutic options (3). The LKB1 tumor suppressor is a master
regulator of cellular growth, metabolism, and survival that is
inactivated in up to 20% to 30% of NSCLC (4–6). In a recent
study, we demonstrated that the biguanide phenformin, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor and metabolic stress inducer selectively induced apoptosis in LKB1-deﬁcient (LKB1/) NSCLC
cells (7). Phenformin induced a signiﬁcant therapeutic response
in KrasG12D driven, Lkb1/ (Kras/Lkb1) genetically engineered

Targeting LKB1-Deﬁcient NSCLC with Phenformin and MLN0128

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Cells were maintained at 37 C in a humidiﬁed incubator with
5% CO2. A549, H460, A427, H838, H23, H157, H596, H1703,
H226, and SW900 cells were obtained from ATCC. H1568, H441,
and RH2 lung cancer cell lines were a kind gift from Dr. Steven
Dubinett [University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Los
Angeles, CA]. All cell lines were routinely tested and conﬁrmed
to be free of Mycoplasma using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma
Detection Kit (Lonza Walkersville). Cell lines were authenticated
in the UCLA Genotyping and Sequencing Core utilizing Promega's DNA IQ System and Powerplex 1.2 System, and all cells were
utilized within 10 passages of genotyping. Cells were grown in
DMEM or RPMI-1640 medium (Corning) plus 5% FBS (Hyclone)
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).
NOVA metabolite measurement
Media were collected from tissue culture plates and analyzed
for glucose and lactate concentrations using the Bioanalyzer 4
(Nova Biomedical). Cells were seeded into 6 cm plates overnight
and were subsequently treated with 2 mmol/L MLN0128 or DMSO
in fresh DMEM (Corning) for 24 hours. Metabolite concentrations were normalized to cell number.
Antibodies and reagents
For in vitro studies, MLN0128 (Selleckchem) was dissolved in
DMSO, phenfomin was dissolved in DMEM. For in vivo studies,
MLN0128 was dissolved in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP),
then diluted in 15% PEG diluted in water; phenformin was
diluted in water at 1.8 mg/mL. Rapamycin was purchased from
LC Laboratories and dissolved in DMSO. Antibodies from Cell
Signaling Technology used for immunoblot analyses were
diluted 1:1,000 and included phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr389
#9234), phospho-S6 (Ser235/236 #4858), total 4E-BP1
(#9644), phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46 #2855), phospho-Akt
(Ser473 #4060), phospho-Akt (Thr308 #4056), phosphoNDRG1 (Thr346 #5482), Phospho-Tuberin/TSC2 (Thr1462
#3611), phospho-GSK-a/b (Ser21/9 #9331), b-actin (#4970),
cleaved PARP (Asp214 #5625), cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175
#9661), and phospho-Raptor (Ser792 #2083). Anti-Hif-1alpha
(C-Term #10006421 1:200) antibody was purchased from
Cayman Chemical and anti-GLUT1 (GT11-A 1:1,000) antibody
was purchased from Alpha Diagnostic International. Plasmid
expressing dox-inducible 4E-BP1 4Ala (pCW57.1-4EBP1_4xAla,
plasmid # 38240) and control vector (pCW57.1, plasmid #
41393) were purchased from Addgene.
Therapeutic studies in mice
We performed pharmacodynamics (PD) studies testing the
combinatorial delivery of phenformin þ MLN128 in wild-type
FVB mice. We treated mice for 3 weeks with either vehicle,
MLN0128 (1.0 mg/kg once a day) by i.p. injection, phenformin
(in water 1.8 mg/mL/ad lib) or the combination of phenformin þ
MLN128 for 6 days on and 1 day off. Because of the lengthy
8-week treatment regimen outlined in our preclinical studies, we
opted for once daily i.p. injection of MLN0128 and ad lib delivery
of phenformin to reduce the stress of daily treatments on mice.
This proved beneﬁcial as our mice showed no adverse weight loss
or morbidity to treatment regimens (unpublished data). At the
end of 3 weeks, treatment mice were euthanized and lung tissue
was collected for biomarker analysis by immunoblot analysis.

We performed therapeutic studies using Lox-Stop-Lox Kras
G12D, Lkb1 Lox/Lox, Rosa26-Lox-Stop-Lox-Luc mice (KLluc) and
Lox-Stop-Lox Kras G12D, Rosa26-Lox-Stop-Lox-Luc mice (Kluc)
that were obtained from Reuben Shaw at Salk Institute for Biological Studies (7). All mice were on a FVB background. Lung
tumors were induced by intranasal administration of 2.5  106
plaque forming units of Adeno-Cre (Gene Transfer Vector Core,
University of Iowa) as previously described (7). For therapeutic
studies, KLluc and Kluc mice were randomly sorted into four groups:
vehicle, phenformin, MLN0128, and phenforminþMLN0128.
Treatment with indicated drugs was initiated 4 weeks post
Adeno-Cre delivery for KLluc mice or 8 weeks post AdenoCre delivery for Kluc mice. Phenformin was delivered adlib at
1.8 mg/mL in the drinking water and changed weekly. MLN0128
was delivered in NMP/15% PEG i.p. at 1 mg/kg once a day. Vehicle
group received NMP/15% PEG i.p. once a day. Both MLN0128 and
vehicle were prepared daily. Mice were housed in pathogen-free
facilities at UCLA. All experimental procedures performed on mice
were approved by the UCLA Animal Research Committee.
Histology and IHC analysis
Tissue isolation, ﬁxation, and staining procedures were performed as previously described in Shackelford and colleagues (7).
Brieﬂy, the following antibodies were used: phospho-4E-BP1
(Thr37/46; Cell Signaling Technology, #2855 1:1600), cleaved
caspase-3 (Asp175; Cell Signaling Technology, #9661 1:200),
anti-p63 (4A4; Abcam, #ab111449 1:100), anti-TTF-1 (8G7G3/1;
Dako, 1:200), anti-Ki67 (SP6; Thermo Scientiﬁc, #RM-9106-S0
1:200), phospho-S6 (Cell Signaling Technology, #4585 1:400),
hexokinase II (Cell Signaling Technology, #2867 1:800), phospho-AMPKa (Thr172; 40H9; Cell Signaling Technology, #2535
1:100), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2; Thr202/Tyr204;
D13.14.4E) XP (Cell Signaling Technology, #4370 1:400), phospho-GSK-a/b (Ser21/9; Cell Signaling Technology, #9331 1:50).
Immunostained slides were digitally scanned onto a ScanScope
AT (Aperio Technologies, Inc.). A pathologist blindly evaluated
the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections for distribution of histologic subtypes, veriﬁed by p63 and TTF-1 immunostaining, and calculated the percentage of positively stained cells
for Ki-67, cleaved caspase-3, phospho-S6, and hexokinase II.
Digital slides were analyzed with the Deﬁniens' Tissue Studio
(Deﬁniens Inc.) to determine adenocarcinoma tumor area and
necrotic tumor area.
Microplate and ﬂow-cytometric analysis
These assays were performed as previously described Shackelford and colleagues (7).

Results
Phenformin and MLN0128 combination therapy compound
energy stress and induce apoptosis in LKB1-mutant NSCLC cells
In a previous study, we identiﬁed the mTORC1 substrate
phospho-4E-BP1 (P-4E-BP1) remained highly upregulated in
KrasG12D;Lkb1/;Luc (KLluc) mouse lung tumors following phenformin treatment (7). We hypothesized that sustained mTORC1
activation may contribute to phenformin resistance and this
provided the rationale to inhibit mTORC1 in combination with
phenformin. We performed a dose-escalation analysis of the
allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin or the mTOR kinase
inhibitor MLN0128 on the KRAS/LKB1–mutant NSCLC cell line

A549 and showed that low-dose MLN0128 potently inhibited
mTORC1 through phospho-S6K (P-S6K), phospho-S6 (P-S6),
and phospho-4E-BP1 (P-4E-BP1) as well as mTORC2 through
inhibition of phospho-AKTthr473 (P-AKT473) and phosphoNDRG1 (P-NDRG1; Fig. 1A; ref. 19). Rapamycin failed to inhibit
mTORC2 and partially suppressed mTORC1 signaling through
inhibition of P-S6K but not P-4E-BP1 (Fig. 1A; ref. 20). We next
performed a high-throughput analysis of phenformin alone or
in combination with MLN0128 on a panel of LKB1-mutant
(LKB1/) NSCLC cell lines that were both positive and negative
for KRAS mutations. LKB1/, KRAS wild-type lines include:
H838, and H1568, while KRAS/LKB1–mutant tumor lines
included: A549, H460, H157, RH2, A427, and H23. We measured both cellular ATP and apoptosis using the cell titer glo or
cleaved caspase-3/7 glo assays, respectively, as a readout of
apoptosis following a 24-hour treatment of cells with either
vehicle, phenformin, MLN0128, or phenformin þ MLN0128.
We found that phenformin þ MLN0128 treatment signiﬁcantly
reduced cellular ATP and induced higher levels of apoptosis
compared with either single therapy alone or vehicle controls
(Fig. 1B and C). In addition, we found that phenformin þ
MLN0128 did not signiﬁcantly reduce cellular ATP levels in
KRAS-mutant LKB1 wild-type human NSCLC cell lines compared with phenformin single therapy (Supplementary Fig.
S1A). We next examined whether rapamycin induced energetic
stress in panels of LKB1 wild-type and LKB1-mutant NSCLC cell
lines and detected no change in cellular ATP levels between the
untreated controls and rapamycin-treated cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). These results demonstrated that MLN0128 but not
rapamycin was a potent inducer of energetic stress. For the

4912 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

duration of the study, we focused on using only MLN0128 as
a single agent or in combination with phenformin.
We next conﬁrmed LKB1 inactivation dictated sensitivity to
phenformin þ MLN0128 combination therapy by screening
KRAS/LKB1–mutant A549 isogenic cell lines expressing pBABE
vector (B), expressing functional LKB1 (WT), or kinase dead
inactive LKB1 (KD). Following treatment with vehicle, phenformin, MLN0128, or phenformin þ MLN0128, we measured apoptosis by staining for Annexin V, cleaved caspase-3, or cleaved
PARP and using ﬂow cytometry and immunoblot analyses,
respectively. Cells expressing functional LKB1-WT showed a signiﬁcant reduction in Annexin V levels compared to cells expressing vector alone (pBABE) or kinase dead LKB1 (LKB1-KD) thus
demonstrating LKB1 inactivation sensitized NSCLC cells to apoptosis following treatment with phenformin or phenformin þ
MLN0128 (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1C). These results
demonstrated that phenformin and MLN0128 cooperate to compound energy stress and enhance apoptosis in LKB1-mutant
NSCLC tumor lines as compared with either therapy alone.
4E-BP1 is a critical regulator of cell survival and energetics in
human KRAS/LKB1–mutant NSCLC tumor cells
We ﬁrst sought to examine whether 4E-BP1, a direct mTORC1
substrate was critical regulator of cell growth in survival in KRAS/
LKB1–mutant NSCLC tumors. Previous studies have shown that
4E-BP1 is a critical mediator of tumor cell proliferation and
survival downstream of mTOR signaling in normal and cancer
cells (21). We took advantage of a doxycycline (dox)-inducible
mutant 4E-BP1 4Ala (4E-BP1 4A) that constitutively binds eIF4E
to inhibit cap-dependent translation (22, 23). We reasoned that

the 4E-BP1 4A mutant would mimic MLN0128 mediated inhibition of 4E-BP1 and cooperate with phenformin to induce energy
stress and apoptosis in KRAS/LKB1–mutant NSCLC cells. KRAS/
LKB1–mutant A549 and H460 lines expressing 4E-BP1 4A (A5494E-BP1 4A, H460-4E-BP1 4A) had a 2-fold reduction of cell
growth after 72 hours of dox treatment (Fig. 2A). Expression of
dominant negative 4E-BP1 alone in KRAS/LKB1–mutant cells did
not inhibit glycolysis, suggesting growth inhibition may be mediated by suppression of cap-dependent translation (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Phenformin cooperated with expression of 4E-BP1
4A in H460 cell lines to induce a signiﬁcant reduction in cell
growth as compared with no treatment or single treatment controls (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, 4E-BP1 4A expression in combination with phenformin enhanced apoptosis in H460-4E-BP1 4A
cell lines (Fig. 2C). Measurement of cellular ATP levels in H4604E-BP1 4A cells treated with phenformin þ dox showed a significant reduction in cellular ATP levels as compared with no
treatment or single treatment controls (Fig. 2D). In addition,
phenformin treatment of H460-4E-BP1 4A cells signiﬁcantly
reduced cellular ATP levels as compared with cells expressing
vector alone (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that inhibition
of 4E-BP1 sensitized KRAS/LKB1–mutant NSCLC tumor lines to
energetic stress induced by phenformin.

ysis. MLN0128 potently inhibited mTORC1 targets P-S6K and P4E-BP1 and mTORC2 target P-NDRG1 in KLluc lung tumor
nodules as shown by immunoblot analyses and IHC (Fig. 3A
and B). Interestingly, MLN0128 failed to inhibit phosphorylation
of AKT at serine 473, suggesting a partial inhibition of mTORC2
in vivo (Fig. 3A). We next examined targets downstream of
mTORC1 that included HIF1a and its target GLUT1, both critical
regulators of glycolysis in LKB1/ cells following MLN0128
treatment (10, 24). KRAS/LKB1–mutant H460 cells treated with
MLN0128 for 24 or 48 hours showed durable inhibition of HIF1a
and GLUT1 (Fig. 3C). Next, we probed lung tumor lysates from
KLluc mice treated with 1.0 mg/kg once a day. MLN0128 for 5 days
and discovered MLN0128 induced inhibition of Hif1a and Glut1
as well as a robust inhibition of hexokinase II (HkII; Fig. 3D).
Examination of glycolysis in KRAS/LKB1–mutant human and
mouse NSCLC tumor lines treated with MLN0128 for 24 hours
signiﬁcantly reduced glucose consumption and lactate production (Fig. 3E and F). We then performed biomarker analysis on
normal lung tissue lysates from wild-type FVB mice that were
administered vehicle, phenformin (1.8 mg/mL ad lib), MLN0128
(1.0 mg/kg once a day), or phenformin þ MLN0128 for 3 weeks.
Lysates were probed for P-4E-BP1, P-Akt S473, and P-Ndrg1 to
measure mTORC1/C2 inhibition and P-Ampk as a marker of
phenformin induced metabolic stress (7, 25). Phenformin alone
or in combination with MLN0128 activated P-Ampk, whereas
MLN0128 single or combination therapy inhibited P-4E-BP1,
P-Akt S473, and P-Ndrg1 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). These results
show MLN0128 is a potent inhibitor of mTOR signaling and key
regulators of glycolysis in vivo as well as a suppressor of glucose
metabolism in NSCLC tumor cell lines.

18F-FDG PET/CT guided studies in KLluc mice revealed

and therapeutic response in lung tumors
We then performed an FDG PET/CT-guided preclinical studies
in KLluc mice as previously described (7) to evaluate efﬁcacy of
phenformin in combination with MLN0128 to target KrasG12D
driven, Lkb1/ lung tumors in vivo. Our use of FDG PET/CT
imaging of mice was to measure therapeutic response as well as
detect therapy-resistant nodules in mice in real time. The treatment regimen and imaging analysis is outlined in Fig. 4A. Analysis
of tumor volume by CT scans and FDG uptake by PET imaging
demonstrated signiﬁcant suppression of tumor growth and glucose avidity after 6 weeks of treatment in single or combination
therapy compared with vehicle (Fig. 4B–D, right). However, FDG

4914 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

PET and CT imaging detected distinct lung tumor nodules that
rapidly developed by week 8 of treatment, indicating tumors had
developed resistance to phenformin and MLN0128 single and
combination therapy (Fig. 4B–D, left). Interestingly, SUVmax
measurements of lung tumor nodules at 8 weeks of treatment
revealed that MLN0128 signiﬁcantly reduced FDG avidity the
entire 8-week course of treatment while cohorts treated with
phenformin alone or in combination with MLN0128 developed
FDG avid tumors by week 8 of treatment (Fig. 4D, left).
We next tested phenformin and MLN0128 as single agents or in
combination on Kluc mice, which develop lung tumors with
functional Lkb1 (7). Because of the longer 15 to 20-week latency
of lung tumor development in the Kluc model, as compared with
10 to 12 weeks in the KLluc mice, we began a treatment regimen in

imaging analysis of Kluc mice treated with phenformin and/or
MLN0128 showed neither drug alone or in combination significantly suppressed tumor burden or FDG uptake after 8 weeks of
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C). Results from CT scans
suggest Kluc and KLluc lung tumors may bypass mTOR inhibition
and phenformin induced energetic stress to acquire therapy
resistance. Interestingly, FDG PET imaging of mice showed that
MLN0128 suppressed glucose uptake and tumor growth most
signiﬁcantly in KLluc as compared with Kluc lung tumors conﬁrming that metabolic sensitivity to MLN0128 was dependent upon
Lkb1 inactivation.

that were consistently present in the lungs of MLN0128 and
phenformin þ MLN0128 cohorts as detected by PET/CT imaging in Fig. 4 prompted us to perform detailed histologic analysis

treated with phenformin (4/7 mice), MLN0128 (5/7 mice), or
combination therapy (6/7) than vehicle-treated mice (2/7
mice; Fig. 5B). We also observed a decrease in the total distribution of adenocarcinoma in phenformin, MLN0128, and
combination therapy cohorts compared with vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 5B). There was a signiﬁcant increase in percentage
of SCC tumors in the phenformin þ MLN0128 treatment group
compared with vehicle (P < 0.05). Conversely, there was also a
signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage of adenocarcinoma
tumors in the phenformin þ MLN0128 treatment group as
compared with vehicle (P < 0.01). The differences in distributions of SCC and adenocarcinoma tumor subtypes for single
treatments were not statistically signiﬁcant as compared with
vehicle or combination therapy. IHC staining of lung tumors
conﬁrmed that the larger therapy-resistant lung tumors were in
fact p63 positive, TTF1 negative SCC, whereas the smaller
residual lesions were adenocarcinoma (Fig. 5C). We measured

sections represented in Fig. 5A using morphometric Deﬁniens
software. Analysis showed phenformin þ MLN0128 combination therapy signiﬁcantly reduced tumor burden and total
lesions in lung adenocarcinoma greater than either therapy
alone or the vehicle controls, suggesting that this treatment
regimen is cytotoxic to adenocarcinoma cells (Fig. 5D and E). In
contrast, a modest but insigniﬁcant decrease in tumor burden
and total lesion were observed in Kluc mice that received
therapy as compared with the vehicle group (Supplementary
Fig. S5A–S5C). Taken together these results demonstrate that
KLluc-mutant lung adenocarcinomas are uniquely sensitive to
MLN0128 and phenformin þ MLN0128 therapy while SCC

are selectively sensitive to phenformin and MLN0128 combination therapy.
We next performed quantitative IHC analysis of KLluc and Kluc
mouse lung tumors stained for P-S6 and HkII. Representative
images and quantiﬁcation of stains show MLN0128 alone or
in combination with phenformin inhibited phosphorylation
of S6 as compared with vehicle and phenformin treatment demonstrating that MLN0128 inhibited mTORC1 in vivo
(Fig. 6A and D). We next examined hexokinase II (HkII)
expression in lung tumors from KLluc and Kluc mice following
treatment with phenformin, MLN0128, or combination therapy. HKII is a key enzyme for the intracellular retention and
detection of 18F-FDG by PET and HKII enzymatic activity
positively correlated with 18F-FDG uptake in human esophageal tumors and xenografts of NSCLC (27, 28). We detected
a signiﬁcant reduction in HkII expression in MLN0128 and
phenformin þ MLN0128 treated lung tumors compared with
vehicle in KLluc mice. (Fig. 6A and E) Interestingly, we observed only a modest reduction in P-S6 and HkII levels in
MLN0128 and phenformin þ MLN0128 treated Kluc lung tumors as represented by IHC staining (Supplementary Fig. S6A
and S6B). These data agree with previous work in which we
observed low basal levels of P-S6 present in Kluc as compared
with KLluc lung tumors (7). The reduced efﬁcacy of MLN0128 in
Kluc mice may be explained by activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK
pathway. We observed a nearly 2-fold increase phospho-Erk
(P-Erk) staining (not signiﬁcant) in MLN0128 and phenformin
þ MLN0128 treated lung tumors of Kluc mice (Supplementary
Fig. S6A and S6C). P-Erk staining was not detectable in KLluc
lung tumors (data not shown), which agrees with previously
published reports (29). These results show MLN0128 inhibited
mTORC1 and HkII expression in KrasG12D-driven lung tumors
in vivo. The combination therapy cooperated to most effectively
reduce tumor cell proliferation and viability in the KLluc mice.
AKT activation is a common event in MLN0128-resistant KLluc
squamous lung tumors
To explain how KLluc squamous lung tumors escaped
MLN0128 single and combination therapy, we investigated feedback signaling that may confer resistance. We examined the AKT
pathway as previously published work on HER2-positive breast
cancer cells identiﬁed a feedback loop that phosphorylated and
activated AKT threonine 308 (P-AKT T308) in tumor cells following mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition (30). We analyzed the AKT
signaling pathway in p63 positive, surfactant protein c (SPC)
negative SCCs lung tumor lysates (Supplementary Fig. S7A) from
KLluc mice that were treated with vehicle or MLN0128 for a
duration of 8 weeks as described in Fig. 4A. We show MLN0128
treatment reduced P-S6K and P-4E-BP1 levels in KLluc SCC lung
tumor lysates (represented by blue boxes), while inducing an
increase in P-Akt T308 and its substrates phospho-Tuberous
Sclerosis Complex 2 at threonine 1462 (P-Tsc2 T1462; ref. 31)
and phospho-Gsk a/b at serine 21 and 9 (P-Gska/b S21/S9;
ref. 32; represented by red boxes; Fig. 7A). IHC staining of
therapy-resistant KLluc SCCs for P-Gska/b (S21/S9) showed highest expression in MLN0128 and phenformin þ MLN0128 treated
tumors (Fig. 7B). These results demonstrate that KLluc SCC upregulate AKT signaling following mTORC1 inhibition.
We next performed an in vitro dose escalation in a KrasG12D;
Lkb1/ (KL) MEFs to interrogate mTOR and AKT signaling at in
vivo relevant doses of MLN0128. We showed that at increasing

4918 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

nanomolar doses, MLN0128 inhibited mTORC1 and concomitantly lead to the upregulation phospho-AKT-Thr308 (P-AKT
T308; Supplementary Fig. S7C). Comparison of P-S6K and P4E-BP1 levels in immunoblot analyses from KLluc lung tumor
lysates (Fig. 7A) to those from KL MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S7C)
showed comparable inhibition of mTORC1 and activation of
P-Akt T308 by MLN0128 at a 20 to 100 nmol/L dose. These results
agree with previously reported pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of MLN0128 in rodent models (17) and suggest
that activation of P-AKT T308 following mTORC1 suppression
may lead to MLN0128 resistance. We next combinatorially treated
LKB1/ RH2 SCC cells for 24 hours with low-dose MLN0128 (20
and 100 nmol/L) and the AKT inhibitor MK2206 (1 mmol/L) and
demonstrated MLN0128 þ MK2206 completely abolished
mTORC1 and AKT signaling as compared with no treatment (NT)
or single therapy (Fig. 7C). Combinatorial treatment of a panel of
lung SCC cells lines (n ¼ 7) with MLN0128 and MK2206 significantly reduced cell viability more effectively than either drug
alone (Fig. 7D). These results demonstrated an mTOR and AKT
blockade as an effective strategy for targeting squamous cell lung
carcinoma.

Discussion
In this study, we found that comutations in KRAS and LKB1
induce a tumor phenotype that is both sensitive to energetic stress
and dependent upon mTORC1 signaling. We demonstrate that
physiologically achievable doses of phenformin in combination
with MLN0128 compound energetic stress in KRAS/LKB1–mutant
lung adenocarcinoma, resulting in restricted tumor growth and
enhanced apoptosis in cell culture and in mice. Combinatorial use
of phenformin and MLN0128 represents a clinically feasible
therapeutic strategy to target this genetic subset of lung tumors.
Oral delivery of phenformin at doses of phenformin originally
deﬁned for management of diabetes may represent a more practical approach to incorporate biguanides into cancer treatment
regimens. For this reason, we delivered phenformin ad lib in
drinking water in combination with a once daily delivery of
MLN0128 that showed no toxicity to animals and was well
tolerated for the 2-month treatment duration. Phase I doseescalation studies will be an important ﬁrst step to begin testing
phenformin as an anticancer agent in human lung cancer.
We demonstrate that MLN0128 robustly inhibited mTORC1
signaling in vivo and identiﬁed 4E-BP1 as a key node downstream
of mTORC1 that governs tumor cell survival expansion in KRAS/
LKB1–mutant NSCLC. It is possible that inhibition of 4E-BP1 and
subsequent suppression of cap-dependent translation may alter
mitochondrial dynamics and cellular OXPHOS (33). MLN0128
and phenformin may also cooperate to disrupt the structural
integrity of the mitochondria, thus leading to caspase-3–mediated
apoptosis. Alternatively, it is formally possible that reduced
translation following mTOR inhibition may sensitize cells to
phenformin through reduced expression of antiapoptotic BCL2
proteins (34–36).
We have previously demonstrated mTORC1 is a key regulator
of glycolysis in LKB1/ cells through HIF1a and its target
GLUT1 (10). MLN0128 treatment downregulated the expression of the HIF1a and GLUT1 proteins and suppressed glucose
metabolism, thus demonstrating that mTORC1 inhibition is an
effective means to inhibit glycolysis in LKB1-deﬁcient NSCLC.
We show the combination of MLN0128 and phenformin leads

to a severe reduction of cellular ATP and eventual metabolic
crisis likely due to a dual inhibition both glycolysis and
OXPHOS in LKB1-deﬁcient tumors. Our data agree with a
recent report that reduced breast tumor growth in Lkb1/ NIC
mice using the mTOR inhibitor AZ8055 in combination with
an inhibitor of glycolysis, 2-deoxyglucose (7, 37). 18F-FDG PET
guided preclinical studies on KLluc and Kluc mice enabled us to
examine glucose metabolism in lung tumors in real time as well
as validate 18F-FDG as a biomarker for clinical evaluation of
phenformin and MLN0128. In a recent study, 18F-FDG PET
was shown to be an accurate and dynamic biomarker to detect
inhibition of glucose uptake following treatment with inhibitors of the mTORC1 and RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (30). Importantly, 18F-FDG PET and CT imaging of GEMMs in combination with IHC enabled us to identify therapy-resistant SCC lung
tumors that were metabolically responsive to mTORC1 inhibition. The combined use of 18F-FDG PET and CT underscores

www.aacrjournals.org

the value of using multiple imaging modalities to evaluate both
tumor size and tumor metabolism.
Phenformin dually inhibits mitochondrial complex I and
induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS; ref. 38).
In previous work, we show that phenformin induced energetic
stress as well as cytotoxic ROS, resulting in apoptosis in
LKB1/ NSCLC cells (7). In this study, we discovered that
SCCs were highly resistant to phenformin, which suggest squamous lung tumors are more resistant to phenformin-induced
mitochondrial insult and ROS than adenocarcinomas as was
recently reported (39). Insensitivity of squamous lung tumors
to phenformin may be explained by low mitochondria content
that is fundamentally intrinsic to squamous cell biology (40).
Furthermore, phenformin actively induces a cellular switch to
glycolytic metabolism (41, 42), which explains the expansion
of FDG avid phenformin-resistant SCCs we observe in KLluc
mice (Figs. 4 and 5). Phenformin-mediated upregulation of

glycolysis in SCC is expected to drive the pentose phosphate
pathway and fuel the production of NADPH, leading to
enhanced redox buffering and resistance to phenformin
induced ROS. In addition, SCC may buffer themselves against
phenformin-induced ROS through upregulation of cellular
antioxidant pathways driven by the oxidative stress response
as was recently shown in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for
lung squamous carcinoma (43).
The prevalence of therapy-resistant SCC nodules may be
explained by an adeno to squamous transdifferentiation (AST),
which has been shown to occur in the Kras/Lkb1 mouse lung
cancer model (44). It is formally possible that phenformin and
MLN0128 alone or in combination may drive adenocarcinomas
to undergo a histologic switch toward a squamous cell fate. This
would be analogous to a tumor subtype switch observed EGFR
mutant adenocarcinoma that developed into small cell lung
carcinomas (SCLC) following erlotinib treatment (45). Whether
SCC tumors arose de novo or from AST, we conclude that the KLluc
SCC tumors would best be treated with MK2206 as a second-line
therapy or with an up front combination of MLN0128 and
MK2206.
Kluc tumors were unresponsive to phenformin treatment
consistent with our previous studies in which we demonstrated
Lkb1 inactivation was required to mediate a response to phenformin (7). Unexpectedly, Kluc tumors showed only a modest
response to MLN0128 or combination therapy. Failure of Kluc
tumors to respond to MLN0128 may be explained by activation
the RAF/MEF/ERK pathway in Kluc lung tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S6A and S6C) . This suggests that RAS-driven lung tumors
expressing functional LKB1 are predicted to respond better to
MEK inhibitors as single therapy or in combination with mTOR
inhibitors as was recently shown in RAS-driven, NF1-mutant
neural sheath tumors cotreated with rapamycin and a MEK
inhibitor (29, 30, 46).
The robust activation of AKT at threonine 308 in our KLluc
SCC lung tumors mirrors a feedback loop ﬁrst described in
HER2-driven breast cancer (47), and suggests activation of
AKT may be a conserved mechanism of acquired resistance to
mTOR inhibition in SCC. As reported previously, chronic
inhibition of mTORC1 leads to loss of feedback inhibition
of PI3K signaling, resulting in the increased activity of PDK1
and increased P-AKT T308 phosphorylation levels (47). As
MLN0128-resistant SCC tumors arose in mice treated with a
catalytic inhibitor of the mTOR kinase over 8 weeks, it also
possible that increased P-AKT T308 phosphorylation could
occur as a result of increased expression levels of multiple
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) as previously reported
(48, 49). In addition, the persistent P-NDRG1 and P-AKT
T473 signaling present in MLN0128-resistant SCC tumors
(Fig. 7A) may indicate mTORC2 activation contributed to
therapy resistance. It will be necessary to interrogate the
AKT-GSK signaling pathway and determine its role, if any
toward conferring MLN0128 resistance. We show that using
the AKT inhibitor MK2206 in combination with MLN0128 can
suppress this signal transduction pathway in vitro; however,
whether such combination would be efﬁcient in vivo in a
clinical setting remains to be determined.
The signiﬁcant response of LKB1/ SCC tumor cells to the
combination of MLN0128 and MK2206 indicate an mTOR and
AKT blockade may be an alternative therapeutic strategy for
targeting KLluc SCCs. Cotargeting mTORC1 and PI3K overcame

4920 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

rapamycin resistance in breast tumors with activating mutations in PIK3CA (50). Moreover, high AKT activation is frequently detected in human SCC and GEMMs of squamous lung
cancer41, (1, 51, 52). MK2206 is currently in clinical evaluation
for NSCLC in the BATTLE2 biomarker integrated targeted
therapy clinical trial (NCT01248247). Future biomarker driven
clinical trials may seek to include MLN0128 in combination
with MK2206 when targeting SCC. Biomarkers P-S6, P-4E-BP1,
and P-GSKa/b (S21/9) could be readily utilized on formalinﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded lung SCC biopsies to measure
response or resistance to MLN0128 as single agents or in
combination with MK2206. Our data suggest that LKB1/
lung adenocarcinoma may respond well to MLN0128 as a
single therapy or in combination with phenformin, whereas
SCC will likely respond best to an mTOR and AKT blockade.
LKB1 mutations either alone or in combination with KRAS
occur frequently in NSCLC and constitute a large patient
population that would likely beneﬁt from the personalized
therapies we have outlined (6, 43).
