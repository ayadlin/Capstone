Abstract
Aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGI) in human
tumors occurs predominantly at repressed genes in the host tissue,
but the preceding events driving this phenomenon are poorly
understood. In this study, we temporally tracked epigenetic and
transcriptomic perturbations that occur in a mouse model of
liver carcinogenesis. Hypermethylated CGI events in the model
were predicted by enrichment of the DNA modiﬁcation 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and the histone H3 modiﬁcation
H3K27me3 at silenced promoters in the host tissue. During cancer
progression, selected CGIs underwent hypo-hydroxymethylation
prior to hypermethylation, while retaining H3K27me3. In livers
from mice deﬁcient in Tet1, a tumor suppressor involved in

cytosine demethylation, we observed a similar loss of promoter
core 5hmC, suggesting that reduced Tet1 activity at CGI may
contribute to epigenetic dysregulation during hepatocarcinogenesis. Consistent with this possibility, mouse liver tumors exhibited
reduced Tet1 protein levels. Similar to humans, DNA methylation
changes at CGI in mice did not appear to be direct drivers of
hepatocellular carcinoma progression, rather, dynamic changes in
H3K27me3 promoter deposition correlated strongly with tumorspeciﬁc activation and repression of transcription. Overall, our
results suggest that loss of promoter-associated 5hmC in liver
tumors licenses reprograming of DNA methylation at silent CGI
during progression. Cancer Res; 76(10); 3097–108. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

ing or alterations in the posttranslational modiﬁcations (PTM) of
the DNA-bound histone proteins such as trimethylation at lysine
27 on Histone H3 (H3K27me3; refs. 2, 3). The identiﬁcation of
several new forms of modiﬁed cytosine in vertebrate DNA has
added to this narrative by providing new patterns for interpretation, hypothesis building, and functional outcomes (4). In particular, 5-hydroxymethlycytosine (5hmC), generated from a
5–methylcytosine (5mC) precursor by the Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) enzymes, is hypothesized to be part of a predicted
demethylation pathway and it differs signiﬁcantly in its genomic
distributions from that of 5mC (5–8). While 5mC tends to be
found over heterochromatic and repetitive portions of the
genome and has known roles in the maintenance of transcriptional silencing, 5hmC is largely restricted to the bodies of
expressed genes, enhancer elements, and a cohort of promoter
regions in many tissues (8–10). Beside a predicted role as a
demethylation intermediate, the functional signiﬁcance of the
5hmC modiﬁcation is still largely unknown. However there
is evidence that the genic levels of 5hmC correlate with the
transcriptional activity of the associated genes in tissues while
low-level direct enrichment of 5hmC over the core of promoters
surrounding the transcription start site (TSS) appears to be related
to transcriptional silencing events and maintenance of CpG
hypomethylation (11–13).
Normal 5hmC patterns are dramatically altered in several
human cancer types such as melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as in cultured cancer cell lines and colon cancer
(9, 11, 14–16). In previous work, we have identiﬁed hypermethylation prone promoters in various human cancer types that

Signiﬁcant advances have been made in the study of epigenetic
reprograming associated with speciﬁc cancer and tumor subtypes

overlap with polycomb-regulated gene sets (17). We speculated
that these genes are prone to methylation due to their inactivity
in cancer host tissue and loss of a demethylase activity (2). A
possibility is that 5hmC/Tet enzymes are involved in this process,
as loss of Tet activity from such promoters may license the
occurrence of aberrantly hypermethylatyed CpG islands (CGI)
in cancer.
Previously, we carried out a number of studies investigating
the epigenetic perturbations that occur in liver following exposure
to the well-studied rodent nongenotoxic carcinogen (NGC),
phenobarbital, to elucidate potential drug-induced epigenetic
changes that anticipate cellular transformation (13, 18, 19).
Phenobarbital is an antiepileptic drug that promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents when administered subsequent to an
initiating carcinogen such as N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN;
ref. 20). This results in selective clonal outgrowth of cells harboring activating mutations in the proto-oncogene Ctnnb1, encoding
b-catenin, a key mediator in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway
(21). In this study, we attempt to delineate the progression of
hepatocarcinogenesis through combined epigenetic (5mC,
5hmC, and H3K27me3 patterns) and transcriptomic analysis.
Our study tracks the initial epigenetic and transcriptomic perturbations throughout the early stages of toxicologic insult and
follows them to an "end-state" that is characteristic of liver tumor
formation in three models (21, 22). As a result, we link initial loss
of 5hmC at CGI promoters with the occurrence of aberrant
hypermethylated CGIs in tumors. This occurs at genes that are
repressed in normal liver and remain silent in the resulting
tumors, possibly due to the continuous presence of the inactivating mark H3K27me3.

Materials and Methods
Study material and animal treatment
For full description of mouse strains and treatment regimes,
please see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Methyl and hydroxymethyl DNA immunoprecipitation
Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen ground-up samples
and fragmented to a range between 300 and 1,000 bp in size
(Bioruptor, Diagenode) prior to immunoprecipitation with
5hmC (active motif #39769) or 5mC (Eurogentic # BI-MECY1000) antibodies. For hydroxymethyl DNA immunoprecipitation
(HmeDIP) and methyl DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) protocols, see refs. 13 and 18. DNA was puriﬁed using DNA Clean &
Concentrator (Zymo Research). 5hmC and 5mC patterns were
then generated following dye labeling and hybridization to promoter speciﬁc microarrays, either on 2.1M Deluxe mouse promoter tiling microarrays (Roche Nimblegen) for the control, 12
week phenobarbital, Ctnnb1, and Ha-ras tumors or on 1M mouse
promoter microarrays (Agilent) for control and NASH hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor samples.
Genome-wide ChIP sequencing of H3K27me3
Twenty-ﬁve micrograms of chromatin was taken for the control
liver, a 12-week phenobarbital-treated liver, and a phenobarbitalexposed liver tumor and H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) carried out using 4 mg of antibody (Millipore, cat #
07-449) as described previously (23). Following this, Illumina
libraries were prepared by Active Motif (Active Motif) and samples
sequenced by HiSeq and mapped against the mouse reference
genome (mm9 build).

3098 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

Preparation of RNA for strand-speciﬁc RNA sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from the 2 control livers, 2 livers
of mice treated with phenobarbital for 12 weeks, and 3 tumors
that arose through sequential DEN/phenobarbital treatment.
Strand-speciﬁc mRNA-seq libraries for the Illumina platform were
generated through poly-A enrichment and sequenced at BaseClear
BV (BaseClear). For details, see Supplementary Data.
Data access
All data for this study can be found at the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) in the super series GSE77731. Published
mouse liver 5hmC datasets were analyzed from GEO series
GSE40540 (13, 19). Published fetal liver RNAseq data were
analyzed from GEO sample GSM850909. Mouse embryonic
stem cell TET1 genome-wide datasets were analyzed from GEO
sample GSM611192.

Results
5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine patterns are
decoupled during hepatocarcinogenesis progression
As phenobarbital is thought to promote carcinogenesis
through nongenotoxic mechanisms, epigenetic reprograming
through long-term exposure is likely to be an important indicator
of liver tumor formation. Our work has shown that mice exposed
to tumor-promoting doses of phenobarbital exhibit changes to
both their 5hmC and 5mC liver patterns at the promoter proximal
regions of many genes (13, 18, 19). Here we expand upon these
ﬁndings to investigate perturbations arising in hepatocellular
tumors generated by a DEN/phenobarbital regimen (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Immunohistologic staining of sections of mouse liver, following DEN/phenobarbital exposure, with antibodies against glutamine synthetase identify Ctnnb1-mutated hepatocellular tumor
lesions, which are dependent on an activated Wnt/b-catenin
signaling pathway (Fig. 1A; ref. 24). Staining with antibodies
against 5mC or 5hmC reveals that these Ctnnb1-mutated tumors
have reduced signals for both DNA modiﬁcations (Fig. 1A), an
observation also reported in several types of human cancer
including HCC (16). DNA modiﬁcation patterns were directly
investigated by immunoprecipitation with speciﬁc antibodies
towards either 5hmC or 5mC prior to hybridization on highdensity promoter microarrays with a set of control mouse liver
DNAs (n ¼ 2) and liver DNAs from mice that had been exposed to
phenobarbital in their drinking water for 12 weeks (n ¼ 2) or in
the excised hepatic tumors from mice that had received phenobarbital for 35 weeks (n ¼ 3). Analysis of overall Pearson correlation scores between the samples reveals that the 5hmC pattern is
strongly perturbed following drug dosing (and in the tumors),
while 5mC patterns are largely similar following drug dosing but
differ greatly in the tumor samples (Fig. 1B). This result suggests
that a change in 5hmC proﬁles might precede that of 5mC.
Next, we deﬁned differentially hydroxymethylated regions
(dHMR) or differentially methylated regions (dMR) between the
control and phenobarbital-exposed livers or between the control
and tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Mapping of the
resulting dHMRs and dMRs to one of ﬁve genomic compartments
(intergenic, promoter distal, promoter proximal, promoter core,
or intra-genic; Supplementary Fig. S1B) reveals that genomic
regions of epigenetic perturbation are largely distinct for the
two modiﬁcations. Following phenobarbital exposure both at

12 weeks and in the resulting liver tumors, 5hmC was strongly lost
over the promoter proximal and core regions and both reduced
and elevated in the bodies of genes (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In
contrast, an increased number of 5mC peaks were observed in the
tumor samples compared with those exposed to short-term
phenobarbital. In addition, although 5mC was seen to be
both acquired and lost at intergenic and intragenic loci following
12-week phenobarbital exposure, hypomethylation was typically
observed at such sites in the resulting tumors.
Tumor-speciﬁc promoter hypermethylation occurs after
phenobarbital-mediated loss of 5hmC
As the 5hmC-modiﬁed DNA is itself derived from TET-oxidized
hydroxylation of a 5mC precursor, we set out to test the relative
changes in both marks across all of the promoters. First, we
identiﬁed a subset of promoter core regions that are marked by
5hmC in the normal livers in this study (Fig. 1C). Independent
validation of select loci by glucosylation-mediated restriction
enzyme–sensitive qPCR (gRES-qPCR; see Supplementary Experimental Procedures) reveals that these sites contain approximately
15% to 20% 5hmCpG, while a control region of low 5hmC and
5mC at Gapdh was only found to contain less than 5% 5hmCpG
(Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3).
Analyses of the DNA modiﬁcation patterns reveal that there is a
dramatic loss in promoter core 5hmC levels in the livers of mice
exposed to phenobarbital for 12 weeks as well as in the resulting
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast, 5mC levels were
unaffected following chronic phenobarbital dosing. However, we
observed a strong acquisition of 5mC at a subset of CpG islands in
the tumor samples, the majority of which were initially marked
by 5hmC in the healthy liver (Fig. 1C and D and Supplementary
Figs. S4 and S5; Supplementary Table S1). Extension of this
analysis with published liver datasets from mice receiving different lengths of phenobarbital dosing reveals that loss of promoter
core 5hmC does not occur following acute drug exposure (i.e., 1/7
days) but instead requires longer chronic exposure (i.e., 28-day
dosing; Supplementary Fig. S6; ref. 19). A reciprocal 5hmC loss/
5mC accumulation was also observed at a common set of promoter elements in the phenobarbital-exposed tumor samples
(n ¼ 2,037), indicating that such a "switch" may be a hallmark
of hepatocarcinogenesis progression (Fig. 1E and F).
Promoter hypo-5hmC/hyper-5mC is a common feature of
mouse liver tumor types with differing activating mutations
To test whether the promoter core loss of 5hmC and gain of
5mC is a feature of chemical exposure or is instead a more general
hallmark of hepatocarcinogenesis, we also proﬁled 5hmC and
5mC patterns in two mouse liver tumors of differing pathology
(Supplementary Fig. S7). One was a mouse liver tumor that had
arisen following DEN induction only, resulting in a Ha-ras–
mutated tumor (22). The second set of liver tumors resulted from
an obesity-based mouse model in which neonatal male mice
develop multiple HCCs following nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) onset (21). In both cases, we observed a gain of promoter
core 5mC at loci normally marked by 5hmC in the healthy tissue
(Fig. 1G and Supplementary Fig. S7). The reciprocal nature of the
changes in 5hmC/5mC persist to some degree in all of the three
tumor types with a general loss of 5hmC accompanied by a gain in
5mC (Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8). While there was a large
degree of commonality in the promoter core spanning probes
that exhibited a loss of 5hmC or gain of 5mC between the three

3100 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

tumor types, there were also a number of regions that were unique
to the particular tumor type, which may reﬂect stratiﬁcation of
particular cancer subtypes (Supplementary Fig. S9).
Promoter epigenetic dysregulation events are related to only a
handful of transcriptional perturbations
To test the relationship between promoter core epigenetic
dysregulation and transcriptional perturbation during hepatocarcinogenesis progression, we carried out RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) on matched control livers (n ¼ 2), phenobarbital-treated
livers (n ¼ 2), and DEN/phenobarbital-induced Ctnnb1-mutated
liver tumor samples (n ¼ 3). Pearson correlation analysis and
principal component analysis (PCA) reveals that the global transcriptomic patterns of the Ctnnb1-mutated tumors were distinct
from both control and phenobarbital-treated liver samples (Supplementary Fig. S10). No clear relationship was evident between
changes in the epigenetic state at promoter core elements with
expression alterations of the associated genes (Fig. 2A). This was
most notable at the promoters of genes exhibiting no signiﬁcant
change in gene expression following phenobarbital exposure
or in the resulting tumors (Fig. 2A, gray plots). However there
is a signiﬁcant retention of 5hmC levels over the promoter
cores of the genes that are repressed in the tumor samples
(Fisher P, 1.99E0.7) and a reduction of 5mC levels over
tumor-induced genes (Fisher P, 2.52E0.15); implying that there
may be a functional relationship between epigenetic and transcriptomic perturbations in the progression of hepatocarcinogenesis (Fig. 2B). A handful of genes exhibit a strong epigenetic
remodeling associated with transcriptional activation, in particular, the cytochrome P450 genes, Cyp2b10 and Cyp2c55, which in
addition to being two of the most strongly induced genes following phenobarbital exposure, undergo a strong loss of both
promoter core 5hmC and 5mC following phenobarbital exposure
(Fig. 2C). In agreement with recent research, the genes that were
identiﬁed as containing promoter core elements that lost 5hmC
and gained 5mC upon tumorigenesis correspond to low
expressed/transcriptionally silent genes in the healthy control
liver (Fig. 2D), highlighting that aberrant methylation at these
loci is not directly linked to a change in their transcriptional
status in the tumor (17).
Key signaling pathways are perturbed during
hepatocarcinogenesis progression
We next identiﬁed differentially expressed genes that arise
following phenobarbital exposure (control to phenobarbital) or
upon tumor formation (control to tumor; >log2 2-fold change
with associated unadjusted P values <0.05). Genes exhibiting a
change in their gene expression patterns were grouped into one of
six classes ("i"–"vi", Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Table S2) based
on their proﬁle in control, phenobarbital-treated samples, and the
tumors. Functional analysis of the genes in each class reveals that
distinct pathways are deregulated following phenobarbital exposure as well as in the phenobarbital-exposed liver tumors
(Fig. 3B). For example, genes deregulated exclusively in the
Ctnnb1-mutated tumors are linked to pathways involved in production of cell adhesion molecules, diabetes, PPAR signaling, and
TGFb signaling pathway, as well as genes frequently mutated or
transcriptionally perturbed in the progression of many cancers
(such as the Wnt signaling protein axin1 and the cell-cycle regulator ccnd1; refs. 25, 26). Close inspection of the data reveals
strong changes in the expression of genes related to control of

over induced gene sets. Fisher P values are shown between plots. C, example of epigenetic perturbation and transcriptional changes at the Cyp2b10

proliferation (Cdkn1a), apoptosis, and DNA damage response
(Trp53 and Gadd45b), as well as genes associated with known
cancer-related signaling pathways (the Tfga gene, the Tgfb
pathway–related tumor suppressor, Chd1, and the Wnt signaling component, Ctnnb1). In addition, we observe strong phenobarbital-speciﬁc responses at select genes previously reported
to exhibit transcriptional changes following toxicologic challange (Gtl2, Prom1, and Cytochrome P450 genes; Fig. 3C).
Together, these data highlight progressive transcriptomic misregulation that is indicative of physiologic changes and a
detoxiﬁcation response.
We also observed speciﬁc expression of a series of genes in the
tumor samples normally associated with fetal liver (Fig. 3D). For
example, a-fetoprotein 1 (Afp1) and Glypican-3 (Gpc3), as well as
the hepatocyte nuclear factors 1a, 1b, and 4a (Hnf1a, 1b, and 4a),
are highly expressed in the developing fetal liver compared
with the mature adult tissue, while there is a reduced expression
of albumin (Alb) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha

(C/EBPa), which are normally found in the adult liver (Fig. 3D).
This may represent either a dedifferentiation of mature hepatocytes into a more fetal-like state or positive selection of liver cancer
stem cells during tumorigenesis, which would have a potential
growth advantage due to their elevated proliferative abilities (27).
Similar changes were also observed in published expression array
datasets for both phenobarbital-exposed (Ctnnb1 mutated) and
non-phenobarbital–exposed (Ha-ras mutated) liver tumors (Fig.
3E; ref. 28).
A unique polycomb-mediated repression signature at CGIs is
established in phenobarbital-exposed mouse liver tumors
It has been widely reported that the global levels and
genome wide patterns of the repressive histone modiﬁcation,
H3K27me3), as well as the enzymes responsible for its
deposition, are altered in many cancer types including HCC
(29–31). We carried out genome-wide ChIP sequencing for
the H3K27me3 modiﬁcation to determine whether these

5hmC at CGIs Predicts Promoter Hypermethylation in HCC

polycomb-mediated silencing mechanisms are also perturbed
in the phenobarbital-derived liver tumors. Peak ﬁnding analysis indicates a general elevation in the levels of H3K27me3
signals in the phenobarbital liver tumors compared with control liver (94,341 (200 bp) window regions gain H3K27me3,
31,995 (200 bp) windows lose H3K27me3; Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S11).
Focusing on promoter core regions, we ﬁnd that these are
relatively unchanged in response to phenobarbital but elevated
in the resulting tumor (Fig. 4B). Studies suggest that promoter
regions marked by H3K27me3 in mouse embryonic stem cells
become hypermethylated upon mammary cancer formation (32).
To test this possibility in our mouse liver tumor, we directly
compared our H3K27me3 and 5hmC/5mC datasets. Plots of
promoter core 5hmC and 5mC change against changes in the
H3K27me3 signal following phenobarbital exposure reveal little
change in the histone modiﬁcation, even though 5hmC levels are
lost at a number of loci (Fig. 4C). However, compared with the
normal genomic proﬁle, there is a strong increase in the number of
hyper-H3K27me3 peaks at promoter spanning loci upon tumor
progression. Interestingly a signiﬁcant proportion of promoters
acquire 5mC without a change in H3K27me3 occupancy
(Fig. 4C). Intriguingly, we observed only a very modest elevation
of the H3K27me3 mark at promoters following phenobarbital
exposure but a strong elevation in signal is observed at many
promoters in the resulting tumors (Fig. 4D and Supplementary
Fig. S12). Promoters that become hypermethylated and hypohydroxymethylated in the tumors do not exhibit this elevation as
they are already strongly enriched for H3K27m3 in normal
healthy livers (Fig. 4D and E). In agreement with the notion that
the H3K27me3 mark is inhibitory towards transcription, analysis
of the promoter regions of genes induced in the tumor indicates
full loss of H3K27me3 is coincident with gene activation in the
resulting tumors. Conversely the genes that become repressed in
the tumor have dramatic gains of H3K27me3 over their promoters in the resulting tumors (Fig. 4D and E and Supplementary
Fig. S12).
To further test the chromatin landscape of this promoter set
in normal control livers, we analyzed the proﬁles of several
other commonly studied histone tail modiﬁcations using publicly available mouse liver epigenomics datasets produced
by the ENCODE project (http://www.genome.gov/encode/;
Fig. 4F). Although there was no observable difference, compared with the total promoter set, in the levels of Histone
H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1), H3 lysine 27
acetylation (H3K27ac), or H3 lysine 36 tri-methylation
(H3K36me3), there was an enrichment at these promoters for
the typically euchromatic mark H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation
(H3K4me3). This suggests that a proportion of these 5hmCmarked promoters are bivalent (simultaneously enriched for
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3).Combined analysis of the promoters that lose 5hmC and gain 5mC in the tumors (n ¼ 2,035)
reveals that a strong epigenetic transition occurs during hepatocarcinogenesis at promoter core elements originally bivalent/
5hmC marked and transcriptionally silent genes in the normal
healthy liver, without leading to expression changes (Fig. 4G
and Supplementary Figs. S13 and S14).
Tet1 protein levels are reduced in mouse HCC
To better understand the epigenetic dysregulation occurring
during hepatocarcinogenesis, we investigated the transcriptomic

www.aacrjournals.org

changes in a selection of key epigenetic-modifying enzymes
(Fig. 5A). In general, the majority did not exhibit a strong change
in gene expression (>2-fold change vs. control tissue). We did,
however, observe a strong induction of the histone H3 lysine 9
demethylase Jmjd1c and the histone deacetylase Hdac11 alongside
a low to moderate elevation (1.5–2 fold) of several HDACs,
methyl-binding proteins (Mbd1), Trithorax (Mll3), and polycomb
group proteins (Suz12). The levels of the methyltransferases
Dnmt-1 (1.64 FC), -3a (1.51 FC), and -3b (0.98 FC) were not
signiﬁcantly altered. We did not observe changes in the levels of
expression of the Tet genes (Tet1, 2, and 3) responsible for the
conversion of 5hmC from 5mC. This result was validated both by
microarray and qRT-PCR; thus, loss of 5hmC in mouse HCC
cannot be explained by the misexpression of the Tet genes
(Supplementary Fig. S15; refs. 14, 19, 33). As levels of the Tet1
protein were previously shown to be reduced in human HCC,
we carried out IHC for Tet1 in mouse liver tumors (Fig. 5B; ref. 16).
In agreement with the results of the human study, we did observe
a strong loss of Tet1 staining in MAPK-positive tumor cells.
Although levels of Tet1 expression in the mouse liver are low
(supplementary Fig. S15), this result indicates that protein levels
are readily detectable in the normal healthy liver tissue. Published
in vitro studies have shown that loss of Tet1 is coincident with the
loss of 5hmC from promoter regions (9, 34, 35). Moreover, in
human embryonic carcinoma NCCIT cells, Tet1 loss was seen to
correlate with hypermethylation of the CGIs and CpG island
shores (9). Interestingly, analysis of Tet1-binding sites in published mESC data reveals an enrichment over the promoters that
we identiﬁed as becoming aberrantly hypermethylated in mouse
liver tumors (Supplementary Fig. S16). To test for the consequences resulting from loss of the Tet1 protein observed in the
liver tumors, we proﬁled 5hmC levels across the promoter regions
in control and Tet1 KO mouse livers by hmeDIP-seq (36). This
revealed that loss of Tet1 in the mouse liver results in a dramatic
reduction of 5hmC over a large number of promoters (Fig. 5C).
This was also observed over the promoter regions identiﬁed
as becoming aberrantly methylated following a loss of 5hmC
during tumorigenesis (Supplementary Fig. S17), suggesting that
direct reduction in Tet1 protein levels or inhibition of TET activity
during the progression of tumorigenesis could account for a
decrease of promoter-associated 5hmC and enable subsequent
gain of 5mC.

Discussion
DNA methylation reprograming has been previously noted for
a host of tumor types including HCC (2, 14, 16, 37). In addition,
changes to the normal 5hmC patterns have also been reported in
both mouse and rat livers following exposure to either nongenotoxic or genotoxic agents (13, 19, 38). In this current study, we
build on these early observations to show for the ﬁrst time in
mouse models of liver cancer that early perturbations in the
epigenetic landscape over transcriptionally silent CGIs that are
marked by low levels of 5hmC and H3K27me3 predicate hypermethylation that occurs in tumors. We utilized several rodent liver
tumor models (phenobarbital-exposed Ctnnb1-mutant tumors,
DEN-treated Ha-Ras–mutant tumors, and NAFLD-driven tumors)
to demonstrate the same observation for each. The reciprocal
nature of these changes ﬁts with the notion that these two
modiﬁcations exist within a programed DNA methylation/
demethylation pathway that is mediated by Tet enzyme activity

(39). A reduction of Tet1 protein levels in mouse HCC may
account for the observed epigenetic disruption; however, this
occurs without obvious changes in Tet transcript levels (Figs. 1
and 5). We propose that reduced Tet1 binding and/or activity at
target CGIs may be responsible for aberrant epigenetic events in
many cancers (Fig. 5D). Direct loss of Tet1 function in liver results
in a similar dramatic reduction in promoter 5hmC levels
(Fig. 5C). In phenobarbital-exposed mice, reduction of Tet1 and
5hmC levels may also be linked to an elevated rate of proliferation
in tumor cells and altered cellular intermediary metabolism
(28, 40). Indeed, it was recently shown that both Tet1 expression
and global 5hmC levels are reduced in proliferating cells in culture
as well as in rapidly proliferating hepatocytes following partial
hepatectomy (41, 42). Finally, the function of the Tet enzymes
may also be affected by altered metabolic programs in these
tumors, such as changes in the levels and utilization of the Tet
enzyme cofactor a-ketoglutarate (28).
Emerging data suggest that the deregulation of normal Polycomb group proteins (PcG), critical mediators of the "silencing" chromatin modiﬁcation H3K27me3, plays causative roles
in oncogenesis (31, 43). EZH2 is often highly expressed in
HCC and can have important roles in tumor progression and
fetal liver development (44). H3K27me3 proﬁling during
mouse phenobarbital exposure implies that an "epigenetic
switch" takes place at the promoters of genes, which are linked
to changes in their expression levels during hepatocarcinogenesis; gains in H3K27me3 are associated with repression of
genes in the tumors, while loss is accompanied with their
activation (Fig. 4D and E). In contrast to the promoters that
exhibit aberrant hypermethylation/hypohydroxymethylation
in the liver tumors, we observed a strong enrichment of
H3K27me3 levels in the healthy tissue, which is not signiﬁcantly altered in the tumors (Fig. 4C, D, and G). Fittingly, these
promoters tend to be associated with transcriptionally silent
genes, a result that matches with observations in human cancers
(17). These ﬁndings are also in line with recent reports in which
H3K27me3-modiﬁed histone tails were found to be associated
with 5mC-marked DNA in cultured cancer cells (45, 46). Our
data build on previous work that indicated that promoters
that are marked with H3K27me3 in embryonic stem cells are
more likely to gain DNA methylation during differentiation
and carcinogenesis than those lacking H3K27me3 (47, 48). We
suggest that Tet1 binding along with PRC2 components mark
promoters that are destined to become hypermethylated in
cancer; this can be inferred by the presence of 5hmC at these
regions in control liver samples. Similar ﬁndings have been
published in human cancer cell lines where promoters marked
by H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 were initially enriched for 5hmC
but lose this modiﬁcation upon depletion of Tet1 by siRNA (9).
The ﬁnding that 5hmC- and H3K27me3-marked promoters
mark sites that later become hypermethylated in the tumors
supports a model in which general aberrant methylation at
CGIs is not linked with silencing of tumor suppressor genes,
but instead indicates decoupling of TET function from PRC2
complexes at these genes. These relationships between DNA
and H3K27 methylation clearly warrant more careful molecular
examination in vivo, especially as culturing of somatic cells in
vitro leads to a reduction in Tet levels and subsequent de novo
methylation at H3K27me3-marked promoters (42).
A recent study in human colon cancer reports that promoter
proximal regions approximately 1 kb upstream of the TSS marked

3106 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

by 5hmC in the normal colon appear to correlate to sites that are
resistant to hypermethylation in colon cancer progression. These
results contrast with both our ﬁndings and recent observations in
mouse mammary tumors and human embryonic carcinoma cells
(9, 32), in which polycomb-marked promoters in the normal state
may become hypermethylated in the resulting cancer. This indicates that epigenetic disruption during cancer progression is
linked to the type of cancer in question and is likely dependent
on a combination of TET protein misregulation, tissue background, and genetic mutation. Further combined epigenetic and
transcriptomic studies, particularly in cancers arising in different
tissues, will be essential to better understand the precise contribution of epigenetic pathways to hepatocarcinogenesis in particular and to carcinogenesis in general.
