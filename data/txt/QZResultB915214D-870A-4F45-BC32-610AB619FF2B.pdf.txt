Abstract
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous
population of myeloid cells that inhibit T-cell activity and
contribute to the immune suppression characteristic of most
tumors. We discovered that bone marrow (BM) progenitor
cells from the Muc1 knockout (KO) mice differentiated into
CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs in vitro under granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 signaling. MUC1 is
a tumor-associated mucin and its cytoplasmic tail (MUC1-CT)
can regulate B-catenin to promote oncogenesis. Given the
importance of B-catenin in hematopoiesis, we hypothesized
that the MUC1 regulation of B-catenin is important for MDSC
development. Our current study shows that the aberrant
development of BM progenitors into CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs is
dependent on the down-regulation of B-catenin levels that
occurs in the absence of Muc1. In light of this, KO mice
showed enhanced EL4 tumor growth and were able to better
tolerate allogeneic BM185 tumor growth, with an accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ cells in the blood and tumor-draining
lymph nodes. WT mice were able to similarly tolerate
allogeneic tumor growth when they were injected with
CD11b+Gr1+ cells from tumor-bearing KO mice, suggesting
that tolerance of allogeneic tumors is dependent on MDSCmediated immune suppression. This further delineates the
ability of Muc1 to control MDSC development, which could
directly affect tumorigenesis. Knowledge of the biology by
which Muc1 regulates the development of myeloid progenitors into MDSCs would also be very useful in enhancing
the efficacy of cancer vaccines in the face of tumor immune
suppression. [Cancer Res 2009;69(8):3554–62]

Introduction
The immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment is a hallmark
of cancer and a major obstacle to immune therapy. Myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are known to contribute to the
immune suppression seen in cancer via mechanisms such as
IFN-g–mediated production of nitric oxide (1), Th2-mediated
arginase 1 pathway (2), reactive oxygen species–mediated killing
(2), or development of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (3, 4). MDSCs,
identified in mice by the markers CD11b and Gr1, are unable to
develop into mature myeloid cells in response to tumor-derived

cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin
(IL)-1h (5).
We discovered that bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells from the
Muc1 knockout (KO) mice developed into CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs
in vitro under GM-CSF and IL-4 signaling. MUC1 is a tumorassociated mucin that is overexpressed and aberrantly glycosylated
in cancer and its role as an oncogenic signaling protein has been
extensively studied in epithelial cancer. MUC1 is expressed to a
lesser extent on hematopoietic cells (6–12), but its role in these
cells have not been as well defined; however, MUC1 is important in
T-cell signaling (6, 7). Our current study shows that development of
BM progenitors into CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs is dependent on downregulation of h-catenin levels, which can be regulated by Muc1.
The MUC1 cytoplasmic tail (MUC1-CT) has been shown to
interact with h-catenin in epithelial cancer and promote oncogenesis. Nuclear translocation of the MUC1-CT-h-catenin complex
allows MUC1 to influence the transcriptional regulatory activity
of h-catenin, driving tumor growth and invasiveness (13). The
MUC1-CT can also compete with E-cadherin for binding to
h-catenin at adherens junctions, promoting the metastatic
invasiveness of the tumor cell (14). In vitro knockdown of MUC1
can down regulate h-catenin levels (15) and reduce cellular
invasiveness associated with increased cytoplasmic localization of
h-catenin (16). Similarly, overexpression of MUC1-CT is associated
with increased stability and nuclear localization of h-catenin (17).
The importance of the Wnt/h-catenin signaling cascade is,
however, not solely restricted to its oncogenic effects, as
constitutive Wnt-h-catenin activation in the BM can result in
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and multilineage defects (18, 19).
In the absence of Wnt signaling, h-catenin exists as part of a
destruction complex where it is subsequently phosphorylated by
casein kinase 1 and glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK3h) for
targeted ubiquitin-mediated degradation (20). Ligation of the Wnt
receptor complex inhibits the activity of this h-catenin destruction
complex (21) and h-catenin can translocate to the nucleus where it
associates with the DNA-binding proteins of the T-cell factor/
lymphoid enhancer factor family to initiate transcription.
In our study, we show that aberrant differentiation of MDSCs
from Muc1 KO myeloid progenitors is dependent on the downregulation of h-catenin in these cells. Given the central role that
h-catenin plays in hematopoiesis and its regulation by MUC1 in
cancer, it is not surprising that the lack of Muc1 in myeloid
progenitors from KO mice could promote h-catenin downregulation and allow for aberrant MDSC differentiation in response
to GM-CSF and IL-4 signaling. This translated into better growth of
s.c. implanted EL4 lymphoma cells in the KO mice. Most
intriguingly, KO mice were also able to better tolerate allogeneic
tumor growth with an accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ cells in the
blood and tumor-draining lymph nodes. Adoptive transfer of

Figure 1. KO Lin BM cells proliferate
better in vitro with GM-CSF and IL-4.
A, Muc1 mRNA expression was analyzed
by generating a relative quantification
graph from four independent experiments
using the DC T from the WT BM as a
calibrator (set at 1). B and C , whole, Lin ,
and Lin+ BM (n = 7) cells were cultured for
5 d with GM-CSF and IL-4, after which cell
numbers were counted and computed as
X fold change over the original plating
concentration. Cells did not grow
in vitro without IL-4 and GM-CSF.
Phase-contrast microscopic pictures of
these cells were taken. D, cytosolic (C )
and nuclear (N ) fractions from day 5 WT
and KO Lin cells were analyzed for
h-catenin via Western blot. Lamin B and
InKa were analyzed as nuclear and
cytosolic markers, respectively. SB415286
(5–20 Amol/L) was added at day 0 of
culture with GM-CSF and IL-4. Data are
representative of three independent
experiments.

CD11b+Gr1+ cells from the BM of KO mice bearing EL4 tumors
allowed for allogeneic tumor growth in WT mice. Our findings
indicate a novel role of Muc1 in regulating the development of
myeloid progenitors into CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs, which would be very
useful in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of cancer vaccines in
face of tumor immune suppression.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Muc1 C57BL/6 KO mice were generated using homologous
recombination as previously described (22).
BM lineage depletion. BM flushed from the tibia and femurs of WT and
KO mice was subjected to magnetic-activated cell sorting against a panel of
antibodies directed against lineage-committed antigens (Miltenyi Biotec).
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor (Lin ) cells were obtained from the
negative flow through, whereas the positive fraction contained lineagecommitted cells (Lin+). Lin cells were plated at 2  105/mL, whereas Lin+
cells were plated at 106/mL in DMEM with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin-

www.aacrjournals.org

streptomycin, and 1% Glutamax. The same doses of GM-CSF (20 ng/mL)
and IL-4 (20 ng/mL; both from BD Pharmingen) were used throughout.
BM transplant. WT female mice were given 11 Gy irradiation split into
two doses, separated by 3 h. After irradiation, 20  106 male donor KO or
WT BM cells were injected into female irradiated recipients via tail vein
and chimerism was monitored after 30 d using PCR analysis of DNA
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for presence of the Y
chromosome gene product in the female irradiated recipient mice (23).
Percentage of chimerism was established using a standard made from the
same PCR of PBMC DNA that contains varying mixed ratios of male and
female DNA.
Flow cytometry. Cells (106) were isolated, washed once with PBS, and
stained in 1 PBS with 0.5% FCS using the following antibodies at 1 Ag/mL:
anti-CD11b FITC, anti-Gr1 (LY6C/G) phycoerythrin, anti-LY6C FITC, and
anti-LY6G FITC (all BD Pharmingen) and anti-F4/80 allophycocyanin
(eBioscience). Acquisition was performed on a Dako Cyan flow cytometer
and analysis was done on Summit 4.3. At least 20,000 events were isolated.
Subcellular fractionation. Subcellular fractionation was performed
using an adapted protocol (18, 24). Cells were resuspended in buffer A
[10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L

EGTA, 0.1% NP40] on ice. Lysate was then spun at 6,000 rpm for 1 min at
4jC, and the supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet
was washed twice in ice-cold PBS before sonication in buffer B [20 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 400 mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L DTT] to obtain the nuclear fraction, which
was then spun at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4jC.
Allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. Dendritic cells (DCs) were
derived from BM cells cultured for 5 d with GM-CSF and IL-4 at 106/mL in
DMEM with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% Glutamax.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 Ag/mL) was added on day 4 to obtain mature
DCs on day 5. They were then incubated with allogeneic T cells at a 1:10
ratio for 5 d, with [3H]thymidine added on day 4 to measure the extent of
proliferation. T cells were sorted from the spleen using magnetic CD4 and
CD8 beads (Miltenyi Biotec).
Tumor study and adoptive transfer experiments. Six-week-old female
WT and KO mice were s.c. injected with 104 EL4 lymphoma cells. For the

allogeneic tumor study, 6-wk-old female WT and KO mice were s.c. injected
with 5  106 allogeneic BALB/c BM185 lymphoma cells. CD11b+Gr1+ cells
(106) from the BM of WT and KO mice bearing EL4 tumors were sorted by
flow cytometry and i.v. injected into WT mice implanted with 5  106
BM185 cells. Adoptive transfer of CD11b+Gr1+ cells to WT mice was
performed 4 d after implantation of BM185 cells and then given every 7 d
thereafter for 3 wk. All mice were palpated every 3 d after 10 d after
injection for tumor growth as measured by (length  width2)/2 (22). When
tumors reached >10% of mouse weight, all mice were sacrificed for end
point analysis.

Results
Aberrant differentiation of CD11b+Gr1+ cells from BM
progenitors under GM-CSF and IL-4 signaling is a result of
B-catenin down-regulation in the absence of Muc1. Expression

Figure 2. Increased cell proliferation from KO
Lin BM cells was due to expansion of the
CD11b+Gr1+ phenotype. A, after 5 d of culture with
GM-CSF and IL-4, cells were analyzed for
CD11b and Gr1 expression using flow cytometry.
Expansion of CD11b+Gr1+ cells could be reversed
with GSK3h inhibitors, SB415286 (SB) or LiCl,
which were added on day 0 of culture together with
GM-CSF and IL-4. Data are representative of three
independent experiments. B, lethally irradiated WT
mice were transplanted with KO BM. Chimerism
was determined via presence of the Y chromosome
gene product and appropriate levels of Muc1 or
LacZ gene product depending on donor BM. Faint
bands below the Muc1 or LacZ gene product
are primer dimers. C, Lin BM from WT mice
transplanted with KO donor BM showed an increase
in the population of CD11b+Gr1+ cells upon culture
with GM-CSF and IL-4 using flow cytometry.

Figure 3. The CD11b+Gr1+ KO cells
obtained after 5 d of Lin KO BM culture
in vitro with GM-CSF and IL-4 are
suppressive. A, day 5 CD11b+Gr1+ cells
from WT and KO Lin BM were sorted by
flow cytometry and incubated in a MLR
with C57BL/6 T cells and FVB DCs (left )
and FVB T cells and C57BL/6 DCs (right ).
B, CD11b+Gr1+ cells from day 5 Lin
BM of WT mice transplanted with either WT
or KO BM were sorted by flow cytometry
and incubated in a MLR with C57BL/6
DCs and FVB T cells. In all MLRs, 5  103
DCs and 105 T cells were incubated
with or without 5  103 CD11b+Gr1+ cells
from day 5 cultures of either WT or
KO Lin BM. C, similar levels of
CD11b+Gr1+ cells in freshly isolated WT
and KO BM were detected via flow
cytometry. D, freshly isolated CD11b+Gr1+
cells from the BM of both WT and KO
mice were sorted by flow cytometry and
incubated in a MLR with FVB T cells and
C57BL/6 DCs. All data are representative
of three independent experiments.

of Muc1 in the BM in wild-type C57BL/6 mice is low compared
with epithelial tissues such as kidney (Fig. 1A). The Muc1 KO
mouse was therefore used as a model to study hematopoiesis in
the BM in the absence of Muc1. The Muc1 KO mouse has
been extensively shown to lack Muc1 expression in epithelial
tissues (25–30). We used the kidney as a positive control to show
the Muc1 null levels in the KO mouse using quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR, where the BM of the KO mouse also showed
similar null expression of Muc1 (Fig. 1A).
In vitro culture of Muc1 KO BM cells for 5 days with IL-4 and
GM-CSF resulted in an increase in the proliferation of cells with a
small and round morphology (Fig. 1B) compared with similarly
cultured WT BM. This observation was also mirrored in the KO
Lin BM cells that were similarly cultured, but not in KO Lin+ BM
(Fig. 1C), suggesting that the increased proliferation seen in the
whole BM culture was due to a lack of Muc1 in the Lin cells.
h-Catenin is regulated by MUC1 in epithelial tissue, and its role in
hematopoiesis made it logical to analyze the levels of h-catenin in
relation to the increased proliferation of KO Lin BM as observed
in Fig. 1C. Western blot analysis of h-catenin levels in Lin KO BM

www.aacrjournals.org

cultured for 5 days in IL-4 and GM-CSF showed a reduction of
h-catenin in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions compared with
Lin WT BM (Fig. 1D). The levels of h-catenin mRNA in these cells
were unchanged (data not shown), suggesting that reduction of
h-catenin in cultured Lin KO BM was a degradation-dependent
process. h-Catenin degradation is triggered by its phosphorylation
by GSK3h. SB415286, a GSK3h inhibitor (31), was able to reverse
the reduction of h-catenin in KO BM cells in a dose-dependent
manner (5–20 Amol/L), with 20 Amol/L SB415286 restoring the
cytosolic levels of h-catenin in cultured KO BM cells to that seen in
cultured WT BM cells (Fig. 1D).
The increased cell proliferation in the KO Lin BM culture
seemed to be due to an expansion of a CD11b+Gr1+ population
from 42% in the WT Lin BM culture to 79% in the KO Lin BM
culture (Fig. 2A). This expansion of CD11b+Gr1+ cells could be
reduced in both WT and KO cultures on addition of 20 Amol/L
SB415286 to 7.65% and 21.34%, respectively. Addition of 7 mmol/L
LiCl, another GSK3h inhibitor (18), also similarly reduced the
expansion of the CD11b+Gr1+ population in both WT and KO
cultures to 32.23% and 67.31%, respectively. These GSK3h

inhibitors that protected h-catenin from degradation were
able to significantly reverse the increase in CD11b+Gr1+ cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
To determine if the in vitro expansion of the CD11b+Gr1+
population is dependent on the lack of Muc1-mediated signaling
from peripheral tissues outside of the BM, we transplanted female
WT mice with BM from male WT or KO mice. This will enable us to
study the in vitro expansion of CD11b+Gr1+ cells from KO BM that
was derived from a WT mouse. All female transplant mice
displayed successful hematopoietic engraftment based on the
presence of the Y chromosome gene product and either the Muc1
( for the WT mouse) or LacZ gene product ( for the KO mouse),
depending on donor phenotype, in PBMCs (Fig. 2B). Lin BM
isolated from WT mice transplanted with KO BM also showed a
similar increase in CD11b+Gr1+ cells when cultured for 5 days with
GM-CSF and IL-4 compared with Lin BM from WT mice
transplanted with WT BM (Fig. 2C).
CD11b+Gr1+ cells that expanded from Muc1 KO BM in vitro
suppressed in vitro T-cell proliferation. To determine if the
expansion of the CD11b+Gr1+ phenotype cultured from Muc1
lacking Lin BM was suppressive, we sorted CD11b+Gr1+ cells from
both WT and KO Lin BM cells that were cultured for 5 days with
IL-4 and GM-CSF. These CD11b+Gr1+ cells were incubated in an
allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) consisting of spleenderived T cells and LPS-stimulated DCs (Fig. 3A). We also sorted
CD11b+Gr1+ cells from day 5 Lin BM cultures of WT mice
transplanted with either WT or KO BM and incubated these cells in
a MLR (Fig. 3B). Indeed, in all MLRs, CD11b+Gr1+ cells from the KO
Lin BM culture were able to better suppress T-cell proliferation,

whereas the corresponding CD11b+Gr1+ cells from the WT Lin
BM culture showed no suppression of T-cell proliferation. This
suggests that the CD11b+Gr1+ cells derived from KO Lin BM
belong to the MDSC population. Interestingly, although the levels
of CD11b+Gr1+ cells in unstimulated BM of WT and KO mice were
the same (Fig. 3C), CD11b+Gr1+ cells sorted from unstimulated KO
BM were able to suppress T-cell proliferation more effectively
compared with WT (Fig. 3D).
Muc1 KO mice show enhanced EL4 tumor growth. The
development of MDSCs from KO BM progenitors in vitro under
GM-CSF and IL-4 signaling prompted us to ask if we could observe
a similar expansion of MDSCs in a tumor model using the KO
mice. S.c. implantation of 104 EL4 lymphoma cells resulted in
significantly higher end point tumor weights for KO mice
compared with WT (Fig. 4A). We saw a statistically significant
increase in the number of CD11b+LY6G+ cells in the PBMCs of KO
tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 4B) accompanied by a trend of increased
accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ cells in the BM, PBMCs, tumordraining lymph nodes, and spleen (Supplementary Fig. S2) of
tumor-bearing KO mice. A comparison of WT and KO mice bearing
tumors of similar weight (1 g) also showed an increase in
CD11b+Gr1+F4/80+ cells in the PBMCs of KO tumor-bearing mice
(Fig. 4C).
Muc1 KO mice are able to tolerate allogeneic BM185 tumor
growth more effectively than WT mice. The preferential
development of the CD11b+LY6C+ and CD11b+Gr1+F4/80+ myeloid
population (Fig. 4B and C) in the EL4 tumor-bearing KO mice
could account for the differences in EL4 tumor growth between
WT and KO mice (Fig. 4A). Given the development of different

Figure 4. KO mice developed larger EL4 tumors.
A, WT and KO mice (n = 8) were s.c. injected with 104
EL4 cells. PBMCs from the sacrificed mice at end
points were analyzed for expression of CD11b, LY6G,
Gr1, and F4/80 via flow cytometry. Tumor-bearing KO
mice had a greater increase in the levels of
CD11b+LY6G+ (B) and CD11b+Gr1+F4/80+ (C ) cells in
PBMCs compared with WT tumor-bearing mice. X fold
change is computed by dividing the number of
CD11b+LY6G+ cells in tumor-bearing mice over the
number of CD11b+LY6G+ cells isolated from
corresponding PBS-injected controls. CD11b+Gr1+
cells from PBMCs of WT and KO mice with similar
tumor weight (f1 g) and their PBS-injected controls
were analyzed for F4/80 expression. Both the mean
fluorescence intensities (MFI ) and percentages of
CD11b+Gr1+ cells that expressed high amounts of
F4/80 were shown. Significance was computed using
Student’s t test.

populations of myeloid-suppressive cells in response to EL4 tumor
growth in both WT and KO syngeneic mice that allowed for better
EL4 tumor growth in KO mice, we also studied the ability of WT
and KO mice to reject allogeneic tumor growth. We hypothesized
that inoculation of an initial allogeneic tumor burden would
generate sufficient levels of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs in the KO mice,
which could hinder the allogeneic rejection of these cells. We s.c.
implanted 5  106 BALB/c BM185 lymphoma cells into the C57BL/
6 WT and KO mice to analyze their ability to reject the
establishment of an allogeneic tumor. Amazingly, 40% of the
injected KO mice tolerated the growth of allogeneic BM185 cells
(Fig. 5A). The allogeneic tumors that grew in the KO mice showed
two phases of tumor growth, with tumors reaching >1 g at 23 days
in four mice and at 31 days in four mice, whereas all WT mice
rejected the BM185 cells (Fig. 5B). Although there was no
significant increase of CD11b+Gr1+ cells in the BM and spleen of
KO mice bearing allogeneic tumors (data not shown), we noticed a
significant increase of CD11b+Gr1+ cells in the tumor-draining
lymph nodes (Fig. 5C) and PBMCs (Fig. 5D) of KO mice bearing
allogeneic tumors. Although our results suggest that this could be a
result of MDSC-mediated immune suppression, it could also be
indicative of a preexisting impaired immune response in the KO
mice, although there seems to be no significant difference in the
blood cell counts for WT and KO mice (Supplementary Fig. S3). We

i.v. injected 106 CD11b+Gr1+ cells from the BM of either WT or KO
mice bearing EL4 tumors into WT mice that had been s.c. implanted
with 5  106 BM185 cells 4 days earlier. Fifty-seven percent of WT
mice that received adoptive transfer of KO CD11b+Gr1+ cells
showed tumor growth, whereas only 17% of WT mice that received
adoptive transfer of WT CD11b+Gr1+ cells showed tumor growth.
All WT mice implanted with BM185 cells that did not receive any
adoptive transfer of CD11b+Gr1+ cells showed complete rejection of
the allogeneic BM185 tumor cells (Fig. 6A).
Reduction of B-catenin in BM cytosolic fractions of
allogeneic tumor-bearing KO mice. The accumulation of
CD11b+Gr1+ cells in the tumor-draining lymph nodes and PBMCs
of KO mice bearing allogeneic tumors prompted us to similarly
analyze the h-catenin levels of both WT and KO mice that have
been implanted with BM185 cells. Indeed, KO mice that could
tolerate allogeneic BM185 tumor growth displayed the lowest
amounts of cytosolic h-catenin levels (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
Muc1 in the BM can act as a signaling molecule involved
in controlling the expansion of MDSCs from BM progenitors.
MUC1 is present at low levels in hematopoietic cells in comparison
with epithelial tissue; however, this has not compromised its role as a

signal transducer as evidenced in T-cell signaling (6, 7). In this study,
we discovered that a lack of Muc1 in BM progenitors resulted in their
aberrant expansion into CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs under GM-CSF and
IL-4 signaling. h-Catenin stabilization also seemed to be essential for
MDSC expansion in vitro as stabilization of h-catenin levels with
GSK3h inhibitors reduced the expansion of CD11b+Gr1+ cells. MUC1
is known to interact with h-catenin (14, 15, 32, 33) and silencing of
MUC1 has been shown to reduce h-catenin levels in epithelial cells
(15), drawing a link between MUC1 and h-catenin stability. This
observation was paralleled in our studies when a lack of Muc1 in BM
progenitor cells increased the susceptibility of h-catenin to
degradation in culture with GM-CSF and IL-4. Similarly, in KO mice
bearing allogeneic BM185 tumors with increased levels of
CD11b+Gr1+ cells in the tumor-draining lymph nodes and PBMCs,
we also observed a greater reduction in h-catenin cytosolic levels of
Lin BM from these mice compared with WT or KO mice that did
not develop any allogeneic tumors. Taken together, our results show
the dependency of h-catenin regulation and stability on Muc1 in
MDSC differentiation.
The Muc1/B-catenin regulatory axis in the BM can regulate
MDSC accumulation in a tumor model. MDSCs are important in
contributing to the immune tolerogenic tumor microenvironment
(4, 34). However, their differentiation process is still relatively
unknown, although the SHIP, STAT, and the S100 family of proteins
are involved (35–38). The increased tumor growth and increased
levels of CD11b+Gr1+F4/80+ and CD11b+LY6G+ cells in KO mice
implanted with EL4 lymphoma cells underscore our in vitro data
that development of a suppressive CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid population

is enhanced in the absence of Muc1. Classic allogeneic rejection is
usually a T-cell–mediated process and the ability of KO mice to
tolerate allogeneic BM185 tumor growth more effectively suggests
that this is dependent on MDSC-mediated immune suppression of
T cells. We also do not exclude the possibility that inherent
defective T-cell or DC function could also contribute to allogeneic
tolerance of the BM185 lymphoma cells by the KO mice, and
studies to further define these possible scenarios are currently
under way. However, adoptive transfer of CD11b+Gr1+ cells from
KO mice bearing EL4 tumors allowed WT mice to tolerate
allogeneic BM185 tumor growth as effectively as the KO mice,
further emphasizing that this is a process highly dependent on
MDSC-mediated immune suppression.
KO mice injected with PBS showed lower cytosolic levels of
h-catenin in the Lin BM compared with their WT counterparts
(Fig. 6B), but levels of CD11b+Gr1+ cells in the BM, spleen, and
blood of these two groups of mice are similar (data not shown).
However, the CD11b+Gr1+ cells from the KO BM were suppressive
in an allogeneic MLR, suggesting that the lower h-catenin basal
levels in the KO BM could result in an inherent tolerogenic capacity
of these mice for allogeneic tumor growth. Further reduction of
h-catenin levels in this process, as enhanced by the lack of Muc1 in
the KO BM, would promote the development and accumulation of
CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs into the PBMCs and tumor-draining lymph
nodes, thus allowing for allogeneic tumor growth in the KO mice.
In our model, the loss of h-catenin in the cytosolic compartment
in response to tumor implantation could also be a mechanism by
which KO myeloid progenitors lose their adherence to the BM

Figure 6. A, WT mice were s.c. implanted with BM185
tumor cells and i.v. injected with CD11b+Gr1+ cells from
either the BM of KO mice bearing EL4 tumors (n = 7;
white column ) or WT mice bearing EL4 tumors (n = 6;
black column ) or without any injections of CD11b+Gr1+
cells (n = 20). B, cytosolic (C ) and nuclear fractions (N ) of
Lin cell lysates were obtained from WT and KO mice
injected with BM185 cells (as well as their corresponding
PBS controls) and analyzed for h-catenin and InKa
(cytosolic marker). Lin BM cells isolated from these mice
were too few for detection of nuclear protein. Data are
representative of three independent experiments.

stroma and mobilize into the periphery or tumor microenvironment as immature MDSCs. Although MUC1 has been shown to
promote the cancer phenotype via oncogenic activation of the
Wnt/h-catenin pathway, this is the first time that Muc1 is involved
in hematopoiesis. Therefore, the regulation of h-catenin levels by
Muc1 as a mechanism for controlling CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid
expansion has significant effect with regard to the development
pathway of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs.
The accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs in the KO mice with
allogeneic tumor growth can also be due to tumor-derived factors
promoting abnormal myelopoiesis in myeloid progenitors lacking
Muc1 as previously seen in our in vitro data. This would
corroborate our in vitro studies with GSK3h inhibitors that suggest
that the elevation of the levels of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs in response
to cytokines such as GM-CSF and IL-4 is a result of h-catenin
degradation in the absence of Muc1 in myeloid progenitors.
GM-CSF is a tumor-derived factor that, when produced at
uncontrolled amounts, can promote tumor growth via the
generation of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs (39, 40) by directly activating
myeloid progenitors (41) or inducing granulocyte macrophage–
specific differentiation in early lymphoid progenitors (42). We
obtained similar data in our experiments with Lin WT and KO BM
using GM-CSF only; however, results were more pronounced when
GM-CSF and IL-4 were used together to stimulate myeloid
differentiation (data not shown). This is unsurprising, given that
IL-4 receptor a is a functional marker for MDSCs (43, 44). Stem cell
factor (SCF) is another tumor-derived factor that acts directly on the
c-kit receptor of myeloid progenitors to stimulate proliferation and
differentiation, resulting in MDSC expansion (3). Addition of
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to Lin mouse BM cultured in vitro with
GM-CSF and IL-4 resulted in an increase in the amount of
suppressive CD11b+Gr1+ cells after 5 days (5), an effect that was
mimicked in our study without any addition of PGE2, but with a lack
of Muc1, giving a mechanistic insight into the differentiation process
of MDSCs from their progenitors. Although we have only looked at
the response of myeloid progenitors to GM-CSF and IL-4 in this pilot
study, it is possible that these myeloid progenitors that lack Muc1
would also be able to respond similarly to other cytokines that
promote myeloid progenitor differentiation, such as SCF or PGE2.
We have previously shown that Muc1 is important for
tumorigenesis in various mouse models (22, 45–48). This would
seem to be at odds with our current data suggesting that a lack of
Muc1 results in aberrant development of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs that
are a hallmark of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Although the ability of Muc1 to regulate the myelopoiesis of

myeloid progenitors into CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs is a departure from
its current role as a cancer-associated mucin in literature, this
suggests that the function of Muc1 can be diversely regulated in a
tissue-specific (e.g., epithelial versus hematopoietic) or differentiation-specific manner by a vast array of post-translational
modifications that have not yet been fully studied nor exploited
in therapy, indicating further complexities in the function of this
mucin. MUC1 is expressed on human HSCs (12) and its expression
on human lymphoma cell lines is cyclical,1 suggesting that
mechanisms exist to down-regulate Muc1 expression on hematopoietic cells in a cancer model. MUC1 could therefore be downregulated on HSCs in cancer, thus promoting the MDSC
accumulation that is frequently observed. Although we are unsure
of the exact mechanisms by which this can occur, studies to further
delineate this process are currently under way.
Our observations with the Muc1 KO mouse indicate for the first
time that Muc1 might be acting as part of a regulatory mechanism
that prevents aberrant differentiation and proliferation of myeloid
progenitors into CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs via stabilization of h-catenin.
This establishes Muc1 and its regulation of h-catenin stability as a
critical mechanistic link between cytokine imbalance and the
myelopoiesis of MDSCs from its progenitors, which could be useful
for therapeutic design against various immunologic malignancies.
In addition, as MUC1 is targeted by many biological therapies
aimed at carcinomas, understanding the possible effects of downregulation of MUC1 on other hematopoietic cells, such as the
myeloid progenitors in our study, is key to learning how best to
optimize treatment strategies. In light of this, our findings not only
redefine the cancer-associated role of MUC1 in current literature
but also highlight the need to further understand MUC1 function in
a tissue-specific manner in context with disease state.
