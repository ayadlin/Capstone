Abstract:
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) are rare, hereditary cancers
associated with neurofibromatosis type I. MPNSTs lack effective treatment options as
they often resist chemotherapies and have high rates of disease recurrence. Aurora
kinase A (AURKA) is an emerging target in cancer and an aurora kinase inhibitor (AKI),
termed MLN8237, shows promise against MPNST cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Here,
we test MLN8237 against two primary human MPNST grown in vivo as xenotransplants
and find that treatment results in tumour cells exiting the cell cycle and undergoing
endoreduplication, which cumulates in stabilized disease. Targeted therapies can
often fail in the clinic due to insufficient knowledge about factors that determine
tumour susceptibilities, so we turned to three MPNST cell-lines to further study and
modulate the cellular responses to AKI. We find that the sensitivity of cell-lines with
amplification of AURKA depends upon the activity of the kinase, which correlates with
the expression of the regulatory gene products TPX2 and HMMR/RHAMM. Silencing of
HMMR/RHAMM, but not TPX2, augments AURKA activity and sensitizes MPNST cells to
AKI. Furthermore, we find that AURKA activity is critical to the propagation and selfrenewal of sphere-enriched MPNST cancer stem-like cells. AKI treatment significantly
reduces the formation of spheroids, attenuates the self-renewal of spheroid forming
cells, and promotes their differentiation. Moreover, silencing of HMMR/RHAMM is
sufficient to endow MPNST cells with an ability to form and maintain sphere culture.
Collectively, our data indicate that AURKA is a rationale therapeutic target for MPNST
and tumour cell responses to AKI, which include differentiation, are modulated by
the abundance of HMMR/RHAMM.

tumour predisposition syndrome [1]. The disease affects
about 1 in 3000 young adults and causes the occurrence
of benign dermal and plexiform tumours. Approximately

embryonic stem cells (mESCs), AURKA is essential
for maintenance of stem cell populations and silencing
AURKA or treatment with AKI was sufficient to drive their
differentiation through mesoderm and ectoderm lineages
[18]. Thus, AKI may have effects on non-mitotic processes
in tumour cells, such as the determination of cell fate and
differentiation.
Here, we propose that AURKA represents a rational
therapeutic target for MPNSTs and that the sensitivity
of these tumours to AKI may be regulated by gene
dosage and expression of HMMR/RHAMM. We find that
treatment with an AKI efficiently stabilizes the growth of
two primary human MPNSTs grown as xenografts in vivo.
The sensitivity of immortalized MPNST cell-lines to this
class of drugs relies in part on the activity of AURKA,
which can be modified by targeted silencing of key
kinase regulators, such as TPX2 and HMMR/ RHAMM.
Treatment with MLN8237 also engages a differentiation
program in sphere-enriched MPNST cells that impairs
their self-renewal and favours differentiation with
expression of neuron-specific microtubule architecture.

8-13% of affected individuals will develop malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) in their
lifetime [2]. Sporadic MPNST are rare in the general
population but account for approximately half of
diagnosed MPNST cases [3]. Both sporadic and NF1associated MPNST are difficult to treat owing to their
resistance to chemotherapy and frequent deep seated
location in the body, which results in 5-year survival rates
in the range of 20-50% [2-4].
The molecular mechanisms underlying the
progression of MPNSTs remain unclear, which limits
the discovery and application of new targeted therapies.
Patel and colleagues identified Aurora kinase A
(AURKA) as a candidate target for MPNST therapy
by first modeling the disease in an animal model,
identifying frequent amplification of AURKA in human
tumours, and then treating MPNST cell-lines grown
in vitro and as xenotransplants in vivo with an AURKA
specific inhibitor, termed MLN8237 [5]. AURKA is an
oncogenic kinase that enables mitotic spindle assembly
[6], and aurora kinase A inhibitors (AKI) often induce a
G2/M cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis in cancer
cell lines grown in vitro and in vivo [7, 8]. Inhibitors
of Aurora kinase B (AURKB) are also effective antimitotic drugs, which often induce mitotic failure and
endoreduplication [8]. Treatment of an MPNST cell-line
with MLN8237 stabilized the cell-line’s growth in vivo
and induced endoreduplication and senescence in vitro
[5]. Optimal application of these emerging therapies will
require a better understanding and prediction of MPNST
susceptibilities and tumour cell responses.
The examination of copy number variants in human,
primary dermal or plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs
of differing grades provides an additional link between
disease progression and the AURKA signalling pathway.
In approximately half of the high-grade tumours and not
in low-grade MPNSTs or neurofibromas, hemizygous
deletion of the hyaluronan mediated motility receptor
(HMMR) gene was reported [9]. The HMMR gene encodes
a multifunctional protein (RHAMM) that enables mitotic
spindle assembly [10] and may attenuate the activation
of AURKA [11], which relies upon a heterodimeric
complex with targeting protein for XKLP2 (TPX2) [12].
As RHAMM binds TPX2 [13, 14], the hemizygous loss
of HMMR/RHAMM that is often associated with the
progression of MPNSTs may release TPX2, activate
AURKA, and provide a growth advantage. Indeed,
both AURKA (20q13.2) and TPX2 (20q11.2) lie within
chromosomal regions that are frequently amplified in
sporadic MPNSTs [15, 16]. Taken together, these genomic
imbalances may oncogene-addict high-grade MPNSTs to
AURKA activity and sensitize them to the treatment with
AKIs.
AURKA also regulates non-mitotic events, such as
apicobasal polarization of epithelia [11], cilia resorption
[17], and embryonic stem cell fate [18, 19]. In mouse

Results
Aurora kinase inhibition is an encouraging
preclinical treatment for human MPNST
A preclinical study of MLN8237 has shown
efficacy against an immortalized MPNST cell-line that
was grown in vitro and as a xenotransplant in vivo [5].
To build on these findings and test the efficacy of this
new putative therapy against primary human MPNSTs,
we treated two human tumours grown as explants in
vivo (Castellsagué et al., manuscript under preparation).
One sporadic (SP-MPNST) and one hereditary (NF1MPNST) primary, human MPNST were separately
transplanted orthotopically and expanded in the flank of
NOD-SCID mice (n= 44 and 39, respectively) to a size of
2000 mm3, randomized, and treated by oral gavage with
vehicle control or 30 mg/kg/day MLN8237 for a period
of four weeks, which is a dosing regimen based upon the
published in vivo pharmacodynamics for the drug [7].
Treatment of animals with MLN8237 resulted in stabilized
disease for tumour explants from both patients, as opposed
to the linear expansion of tumour volumes in the vehicle
treated cohorts (SP-MPNST, p <0.0001; NF1-MPNST,
p= 0.0011) (Fig 1A,B). Once the dosing schedule was
completed, tumours were excised and weighed. Consistent
with the caliper measurements, treatment with MLN8237
resulted in tumour masses that were significantly lower in
both the NF1-MPNST and SP-MPNST explants (p<0.01)
compared to those of vehicle treated tumours (Fig 1A,B).
For insight into the mechanisms through which
MLN8237 stabilized tumour growth, we examined the

were orthotopically transplanted into NOD/SCID mice and allowed to grow to 2000 mm3 before treatment of 30mg/kg MLN8237 or vehicle
was delivered daily. Treatment with MLN8237 resulted in stable disease after 2 weeks treatment, as determined by calliper measurements

excised SP-MPNSTs by immunohistochemistry and found
evidence that MLN8237 causes tumour cells to exit the
cell cycle and/or undergo endoreduplication. MLN8237treated tumours contained significantly fewer Ki67positive

cells than the vehicle treated controls (Fig 1C) while the
fraction of polyploid cells, as measured through the DAPI
counterstain, was increased within the treated tumour cells
(Fig 1C).

lysates from these cells contained negligible levels of
AURKA (Fig. 2A). When the expression of AURKA was
silenced in S462 cells through transfection of four distinct
siRNA constructs, cell survival was significantly impacted
and proportional to the degree of AURKA silencing
achieved by the various siRNA constructs, which implied
a dose-response between AURKA abundance and cell
growth rate or viability (Fig. 2B). We obtained three AKIs

To examine MPNST cellular responses to
MLN8237 in greater detail, we studied three established
and immortalized MPNST cell-lines. In two of the celllines (S462 and 2884), the expression of AURKA and
the kinetics of growth in vitro were equivalent (Fig. 2A).
The 2885 cell-line, however, was poorly proliferative and

treated with varying concentrations of AKI showed dose
dependent reduction of pRHAMM (Fig S1A). This was
confirmed with immunofluorescence analysis of the autoactivated kinase (p-AURKA) [12] and two downstream
substrates (pRHAMM and p-histone H3) [11, 20] (Fig
S1B). Each of the MPNST cell-lines was then separately
treated with each AKI. Following 72 hours of treatment
with MLN8237, the survival of each MPNST cell-line in
vitro was reduced significantly (Fig. 2C). However, the
sensitivity of the cell-lines did not completely align with
the levels of AURKA expression, as would be predicted
from the results of the siRNA experiments.
The 2885 cell-line resisted MLN8237 treatment and

required 400-725 fold higher concentrations to inhibit 50%
of cellular growth (IC-50) (Fig. 2C), which is consistent
with the negligible expression of AURKA in this cell-line.
Despite equivalent growth rates and AURKA abundance
in 2884 and S462 cells, however, the cellular responses
to MLN8237 were significantly different (p=0.02) with
S462 being the more sensitive (Fig. 2C). We found that
S462 cells were also 2.2 – 9.2 fold more sensitive to the
pan-Aurora inhibitors VX680 (IC-50- 2884, 387 ±47 nM;
S462, 42 ±10 nM) and C1368 (IC-50- 2884, 2925 ±135
nM; S462, 1302 ±264 nM) (Fig. 2C), which implied that
factors intrinsic to these cell-lines may influence their
responses to AKI.

shown) of MLN8237 treatment approximately 10% of
cells were apoptotic regardless of the MPNST cell-line
examined (Fig. 5A and 5B). Similar levels of apoptosis
were also seen with exposure to VX680, which suggested
that this cytostatic pathway may not account for the
differential susceptibility of 2884 and S462 cells to these
AKIs. Next, we examined the levels of polyploidy, as
detected by immunofluorescence (DAPI counterstain)
or fluorescent cytometry (PI) (Fig. 5C), and senescence,
as measured through the activity of senescence activated
beta-galactosidase [21] (Fig. 5D). After 72 hours exposure
to VX680, but not to MLN8237, we found dramatic
changes in gross nuclear morphology and the induction
of senescence in both cell lines (Fig. 5B). Polyploidy was
significantly more pronounced in S462 cells treated with
VX680. However, it was only when the dose of MLN8237
was increased to 1µM that the levels of polyploidy
observed by cytometry were significantly greater than
vehicle-treated populations (Fig. 5C).

(Fig 3A). So, we screened genomic DNA from each of
the MPNST cell-lines on a high density oligonucleotide
a-CGH platform for insight into a putative mechanism that
accounts for the elevated kinase activity in S462 cells.
The 2885 cell-line displayed a relatively diploid
genome, however, we identified copy number variation
in the region surrounding AURKA in 2884 and S462
cells (Fig. S2A, B). In S462 cells, the region surrounding
TPX2 (20q11.2) was also amplified (Fig 3B). While in
2884 cells, the region surrounding HMMR/RHAMM
(5q33.2-qter) was amplified (Fig 3B). These genomic
imbalances implied that the S462 cell-line may express
more TPX2, a protein that activates AURKA [12], and
less RHAMM, a protein that sequesters TPX2 [11], and
these imbalances may enhance AURKA activity. With
quantitative genomic PCR, we confirmed the amplification
of TPX2 and HMMR/RHAMM in 2884 and S462 cells,
respectively (Fig. 3C). Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR
(Fig 3D) and quantitative immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3E)
showed that the respective gene products were expressed
in these cell-lines proportionate to the underlying genomic
amplifications.
To investigate whether altering the expression
of TPX2 or HMMR/RHAMM is sufficient to modify
MPNST cellular responses to AKI, we established stable
S462 and 2884 sub-lines that express shRNA targeting
TPX2 or HMMR/RHAMM, respectively, as well as a
non-hairpin (NHP) shRNA control. The growth kinetics
for sub-lines did not differ significantly to NHP controls
(Fig S3A, C). We silenced TPX2 within S462 cells and,
after drug selection, reduced TPX2 protein abundance
by approximately 40% (Fig. 4A). However, the reduced
expression of TPX2 did not alter the IC-50 for MLN8237
(Fig 4B) or VX680 (Fig S3B). Next, we silenced HMMR/
RHAMM within 2884 cells with redundant constructs
(shR1 and shR2) and achieved stable reduction of
approximately 65% of RHAMM protein after drug
selection (Fig. 4C). The IC-50 for MLN8237 (Fig 4D)
and VX680 (Fig S3C) were significantly reduced in sublines in which HMMR/RHAMM was silenced. Moreover,
the levels of AURKA and p-AURKA immunofluorescence
intensity were both augmented at spindle poles in mitotic
2884 cells with stable shRNA-mediated silencing of
RHAMM (Fig. 4E). These findings suggest that silencing
of HMMR/RHAMM augments AURKA activity and
sensitizes MPNST cells to AKI.
We sought to identify and modulate the responsible
pathways behind the cytostatic effects of MLN8237 on
MPNST cell-lines and focused our initial investigations
on pathways that are frequently altered in cells treated
with AKI, such as apoptotic cell death, arrest at the
G2-M transition, endoreduplication, and replicative
senescence [8]. Through high-content analysis of nuclei
that stained positive for annexin V (marker for early
apoptosis) but not for propidium iodide (PI, marker for
necrotic death), we found that after 48 or 72 hours (not

MLN8237 induces the differentiation of MPNST
cancer stem-like cells
The levels of polyploidy, apoptosis or senescence
did not explain the elevated sensitivity of S462 cells to
MLN8237, so we investigated an alternative cytostatic
pathway. As the S462 cell-line contains a subset of cancer
stem-like cells [22] and small-molecule AKIs modify the
cellular fates of mESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells
[18, 19], we asked whether treatment with MLN8237 may
promote the differentiation of these MPNST cancer stemlike cells. As a first step, we investigated the abilities of
S462 and 2884 cell-lines to form spheroids when cultured
under stem cell conditions. While no spheroids were
identified in 2884 cultures, 5.6 ± 1.2% of S462 cells (168
±25 of 3,000 seeded) are capable of forming spheroids
(Fig. 6A). Secondary passage formed significantly more
spheres (Fig. 6A, labeled passage 1), which is consistent
with a published report describing self-renewal of sphereinitiating cells in these cultures [22]. Next, we measured
AURKA activity and found that p-AURKA, but not total
AURKA, was elevated in dissociated sphere cells relative
to parental adherent cells (Fig. 6B). To determine whether
AURKA activity was necessary for the growth or selfrenewal of MPNST spheres, S462 cells were seeded at
low densities in the presence of either DMSO or IC-50
concentrations of MLN8237. By Day 6 (passage 0), sphere
formation was significantly inhibited in cells treated with
MLN8237 in comparison to the vehicle alone treated cells
(166 to 29 spheres in the DMSO and MLN8237 treated
cells, respectively. p<0.05) (Fig 6C). When we dissociated
spheres and re-seeded for a second passage, we found that
the number of spheres formed was significantly reduced in
the presence of MLN8237, which suggests that AURKA
activity is necessary for the propagation and self-renewal

of sphere-enriched cancer stem-like cells.
Compared to vehicle treated cultures, spheres
that formed in the presence of AKI were significantly
smaller in size and less uniform in shape (Fig. 6C),
which suggested to us the potential engagement of a
differentiation pathway. To determine whether treatment
with MLN8237 can influence the differentiation capacity
of MPNST cells, we dissociated sphere-enriched cells and
cultured them on matrigel for nine days in the presence of
MLN8237 or vehicle control. Dissociated sphere cells then
grew either as adherent colonies or as attached spheres on
the matrigel-coated coverslips (Fig. 6D). At seeding and
after nine days of culture, sphere cells were stained for
nestin, a type IV intermediate filament protein and marker
for neuroprogenitor cells, and Tuj1, a neuron-specific
class III β-tubulin and neural differentiation marker
[23]. We found that MLN8237 treatment, in relation to
vehicle alone, modified the cellular fate of sphere cells and
resulted in the loss of nestin staining, strong expression
of the neuronal marker Tuj1, and morphological changes
consistent with neurons, such as neurite-like extensions
(Fig. 6D). In contrast, DMSO vehicle treated control cells
maintained a round morphology and nestin expression,
suggesting that adherent culture alone was not inducing
their differentiation.
To investigate whether silencing of TPX2 or HMMR/
RHAMM expression, respectively, is sufficient to prevent
or endow sphere-forming capacity on MPNST cell-lines,
we cultured the S462 and 2884 sub-lines under stem cell
conditions. Stable silencing of TPX2 did not significantly
alter the propagation of sphere-forming S462 cells in the
first passage, but may have impacted their self-renewal
capacity, as indicated by a significant reduction in the
number of spheres formed during the second passage (Fig.
6E). However, the stable silencing of HMMR/ RHAMM
endowed 2884 cells with the capacity to both propagate
and self-renew as sphere-forming cells (Fig 6F).

treated tumours in vivo, which may reflect concomitant
inhibition of AURKA and AURKB at these dosages.
Mitotic failure and polyploidy are common cellular
response to inhibition of AURKB [8] and both MLN8237
in vivo treatment protocols (20 mg/kg/dose, twice daily or
30 mg/kg/dose, one daily) result in blood plasma levels
in excess of 2.5 µM [5, 7], which exceeds the described
IC-50 against AURKB in cell-based assays [7]. We found,
however, that a subset of sphere-enriched MPNST cells
may engage a differentiation program in response to AKI.
To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of
AKI to drive the differentiation of sphere-enriched cancer
stem-like cells. We found that AURKA activity is critical
to the propagation and self-renewal of MPNST sphere cells
and that these phenotypes were responsive to the silencing
of regulators for the kinase, such as TPX2 and HMMR/
RHAMM. A strong correlation has been drawn between
AURKA expression and the maintenance of pluripotency
in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and, similar to
our findings, silencing AURKA and treatment with AKI
was sufficient to drive their differentiation [18]. In mESCs,
this action of AURKA relies upon the phosphorylation
and suppression of p53 activity, which may be a TPX2independent action as silencing TPX2 did not cause
significant defects in self-renewal [18]. In our studies,
however, we find that altering the abundance of either
TPX2 or HMMR/RHAMM was sufficient to modify the
growth of MPNST cells as spheres in stem cell cultures.
Thus, mitotic and non-mitotic roles for AURKA are likely
to regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of sphereenriched cancer stem-like cells, mESC self-renewal [18],
and reprogramming of somatic cells to produce human
induced pluripotent stem cells [19].
MPNSTs often resist chemotherapies and are prone
to high rates of disease relapse [2-4]. Here, we find that
AKI may potentiate the growth and self-renewal of
MPNST spheroid forming cells, which suggests that
these drugs may be effective against recurrent disease
arising from a reservoir of cancer-stem like cells. Indeed,
inhibitors for aurora kinases are effective against tumour
cell lines that are refractory to EGFR inhibition [25, 26].
These cellular responses to AKI likely rely upon the
activity of p53, which is often lost in MPNST [27] and is
critical to the supervision of mitotic failure and tetraploidy
[28, 29]. AKIs are sufficient to delay G2/M progression
and the resolution of this delay, be it apoptosis or mitotic
slippage followed by endoreduplication, relies upon
the action of p53 [30]. Therefore, concurrent activation
of the p53 pathway may be an important consideration
when designing combination therapies for AKIs against
MPNST. Such an approach has been shown to augment
the pro-apoptotic actions of AKIs in cell-line models for
carcinomas [31, 32].
Molecular-targeted single agent therapies often fail
to demonstrate a significant survival benefit in patient
populations in part due to our inability to predict tumour

Discussion
A recent study identified AKI as a viable treatment
platform for MPNST by first modeling the disease in an
animal model and then identifying differentially expressed
genes, including AURKA [5]. In common with their report,
we identified genomic amplification of AURKA in MPNST
cell-lines (Fig S2B) and found that robust inhibition of
growth in vitro followed the silencing of AURKA or the
treatment of cells with AKI, which also stabilized the
growth of two primary, human MPNST when grown
as xenotransplants in animal models. By studying the
responses of primary human MPNSTs grown in vivo,
our animal models also contain non-neoplastic cells
from the human tumour environment, which are critical
for tumourigenicity [24]. However, we did not identify
a significant level of endoreduplication downstream of
AKI except at relatively high doses in vitro and within our

and this genomic loss associates with an increase in the
expression of AURKA in trans [38]. Thus, genomic loss
of HMMR/RHAMM may indicate a subset of tumours that
are reliant upon AURKA and highly susceptible to AKI.
In summary, our findings and those of Patel and
colleagues [5] highlight AURKA as a new therapeutic
target for MPNST. For the first time, we describe a
pro-differentiation effect for AKI on a subset of sphereenriched cancer stem-like cells and demonstrate that
copy number alteration of regulatory gene-products, like
HMMR/RHAMM and TPX2, can significantly impact the
tumour cellular responses to these emerging therapies.

responses. So, we aimed to understand and modulate the
response of MPNST to AKI. Our study shows that the
responses of MPNST cells in vitro to AKI treatment can
be significantly altered by the silencing of key regulatory
molecules. For example, silencing of HMMR/RHAMM
in 2884 cells, which contain genomic amplification of
5q32-qter, significantly impacts the sensitivity to AKI
and endows these cells with the ability to grow in stem
cell culture, presumably through the release of TPX2
and activation of AURKA. Consistently, silencing of
HMMR/RHAMM in breast epithelia cells modulates
TPX2 location and augments kinase activity [11] while
attenuation of Xenopus RHAMM (XRHAMM) may
activate AURKA during anastral spindle assembly [33].
Genomic changes that accompany the transition of
benign neurofibromas to MPNSTs occur at the HMMR/
RHAMM locus [9], the AURKA locus [5](Fig. S2B) and
chromosome 20q (containing AURKA and TPX2) [9, 15,
16]. Therefore, these genomic imbalances may endow a
growth advantage to a subset of human primary MPNSTs
but also make these tumours exquisitely sensitive to AKI.
Silencing of RHAMM may affect AURKA activity
in a context or cell-type dependent manner. In multiple
myeloma cells, RHAMM depletion protects against
AKI treatment [34]. In Xenopus, XRHAMM depletion
impaired TPX2 location and anastral assembly [13], which
should reduce AURKA activity at sites of assembly. We
believe these apparent contradictory findings are resolved
by a bimodal model for RHAMM function. RHAMM is
critical to the correct mitotic location of TPX2 [13, 14]
and, therefore, its complete loss impairs TPX2-AURKA
complex formation and attenuates kinase activity.
However, RHAMM is also a substrate for the active kinase
that negatively regulates AURKA activation through the
sequestration of TPX2 [11]. Thus, the hemizygous loss
of HMMR/RHAMM, or silencing its expression in 2884
cells with genomic amplification of 5q, may relax this
negative feedback mechanism, augment kinase activity,
and sensitize tumour cells to AKI.
Our studies indicate that hemizygous loss of
HMMR/RHAMM, which occurs in approximately 50%
of aggressive MPNST [9], may oncogene-addict tumours
to AURKA activity and sensitize these cancers to AKI.
This insight may be applied to other tumour subtypes.
For example, variation in the genomic region surrounding
HMMR/RHAMM, and the HMMR/RHAMM gene [11],
modifies the risk to develop breast cancer in carriers of
germline BRCA1 mutations [35]. These carriers often
develop breast tumours that do not express estrogen
receptor, progesterone receptor or human epidermal
growth factor receptor (HER-2), resemble basal epithelia
by gene expression profiles (i.e. basal subtype), and are
refractory to anti-estrogen therapy, hormone therapy, and
targeted therapies directed against HER-2 [36]. The loss
of 5qter, a genomic region surrounding HMMR/RHAMM,
is a frequent event in basal subtype breast cancer [37],

Materials and Methods
In vivo animal models
Four-month-old male NOD/SCID mice were
anesthetized with isofluorane and orthotopically implanted
with 1 mm3 piece of explant tumour in both legs, near
the sciatic nerve (Castellsagué et al. manuscript under
preparation). Tumour volume was calculated at V=
(W2*L (π/6)), where L is the longest diameter and W is
the width. Mice were randomly assigned to treatment
or control groups. Dosage of MLN8237 in mice was
previously determined (31). Mice were treated by
gavage once daily with 30mg/kg MLN8237 or vehicle
(10% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and 1% sodium
bicarbonate) for 28 days. Tumours were measured every
3 days. At the end of the treatment period, mice were
euthanized and harvested tumours were fixed in formalin.

Adherent culture and culture as spheres
Cell-lines were obtained from Drs. VF Mautner
and L Kluwe (University Hospital Eppendorf, Germany)
or the ATCC and were cultured as recommended. Unless
noted otherwise, cells were seeded at 1.0 x 104 (S462 cellline) or 3.0 x 104 (2884 and 2885 cell-lines) cells/well in
24-well culture plates and allowed to adhere for 24 hours
prior to the denoted treatment. These seeding densities
resulted in equivalent growth kinetics for S462 and 2884
cells. The culture of S462 spheres followed the protocol
in [22].

siRNA and small molecule reagents
siRNA (Qiagen, Table S1) were transfected at
10 pmol/well using Lipofectamine2000™ according
to manufacturer’s protocols (Invitrogen). AURKA
knockdown was confirmed at 48 hours post transfection.
Small-molecule AKIs were dissolved and diluted in
DMSO/DMEM and included the pan-aurora inhibitors

extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), quantified with
NanoDrop and converted to cDNA using AccessQuick
(VWR) as per manufacturer’s protocols. For primers
and PCR conditions see Table S1. Results were analyzed
using the ∆∆Ct method. Expression of transcript/gene was
normalized to TATA box binding protein levels, which was
then normalized to levels of transcript/gene in 2885 cells.

Lentivirus mediated shRNA knockdown and
generation of sub-lines
Lentivirus packaging, envelope and control nonhairpin (NHP) pLKO.1 plasmids (Addgene) were used
with shRNA against RHAMM and TPX2 (Sigma) as
described in [11] (Table S1). Transfected cells were
selected with 0.5µg/ml puromycin (GIBCO) and
maintained with 0.3µg/ml puromycin.

Array comparative
(a-CGH)

hybridization

Genomic DNA was isolated using the Gentra
Puregene Cell Kit (Qiagen). Purified DNA was
digested with Bovine DNase I (Ambion). Test and
control samples were labelled with Alexa5 and Alexa3
dyes respectively using the BioPrime Total Genomic
Labeling Kit (Invitrogen). Labeled samples were
competitively hybridized to 2 x 400k Human CGH
Arrays (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by the
manufacturer. Copy number estimates were extracted
from the microarray image files using Feature Extraction
10.5 (Agilent) and the data were analyzed in Agilent
Genomic Workbench 6.5 (Agilent) after centralization
and fuzzy zero normalization matrixes were applied.
Copy number abnormalities were identified using the
ADM-2 algorithm with a threshold setting of 5.5 and
regions were only considered significant if they were
defined by a minimum of 3 probes and the average log2
value exceeded a threshold of 0.2 (grey shaded regions).

Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and
immunoblot analyses
Antibodies were sourced as follows: RHAMM
(Epitomics), TPX2 (Novus), nestin (Covance), Tuj1
(Covance), β-actin (Sigma), AURKA, phospho (p)AURKA (Thr288), p-histone H3 (Ser10), and caspase 9
(Cell Signalling). The p-RHAMM (Thr703) polyclonal
antibody is characterized in [11].
Cell-lines were fixed and permeabilized in methanol.
Antibodies were diluted in PBS-0.1% Tween and 3% BSA
(Sigma). Coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol/PBS
with DAPI (Invitrogen) and images were acquired and
analyzed using an Olympus FV10i confocal microscope.
For immunofluorescence of spheres, coverslips were
coated with 2% geltrex (Invitrogen) in Neurocult media
(StemCell Technologies) before cells were plated. Cells
were fixed with 4% PFA and then stained.
Immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections
was done as in [11]. Secondary antibody staining
was done with the relevant antibodies for 30 minutes
at room temperature. Staining was visualized by
3,3-diaminobenzidine, with Hematoxylin as a counterstain.
Western blot analyses were performed on lysates
collected from sub-confluent MPNST cells lysed in
modified RIPA buffer, as described [39]. Levels of protein
were detected and quantified with the Odyssey infra-red
imaging system (LI-COR) using IRDye 800- or IRDye
680-conjugated secondary antibodies (Rockland) or
through chemiluminescence detection of HRP-conjugated
antibodies (Sigma).

Cell based assays
For cell viability assays, MPNST cell-lines
were plated and after 24 hours were treated with
carrier alone (0.1% DMSO) or AKIs at indicated
concentrations. Viability was quantified after 72 hours
by addition of 5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium (MTT, Invitrogen) as recommended by the
manufacturer. Each condition was done in triplicate and
repeated three times. For growth curves, MTT assays were
conducted at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after plating.
For nuclear content analysis by FACS, cells were
harvested, fixed and stained as in [40] and analyzed
with FACS Calibur and CellQuestPro software (BD
Biosciences), respectively. For polyploidy analysis,
AKI treated cells were stained with DAPI. Nuclei area
was measured using Image J software. Annexin V (BD
Biosciences) staining followed manufacturer’s protocol.
Images were collected with a High Content Analyzer
(ArrayScan VTI, Cellomics).
Cellular senescence was measured by detection of
senescence-activated β-Galactosidase activity. Cells were
plated, treated with AKIs for 72 hours, fixed and stained
as described in [21].

Genomic and reverse-transcriptase PCR and realtime PCR
Genomic DNA was extracted with the DNeasy
extraction kit (Qiagen) and preparations were measured
with a NanoDrop (Thermo-Fisher). For real-time, genomic
PCR, reactions were run in triplicate with an Applied
Biosystems 7000 series machine (Invitrogen). RNA was
