Abstract

Author Manuscript

TGF-β is an important regulator of breast cancer progression. However, how the breast cancer
microenvironment regulates TGF-β signaling during breast cancer progression remains largely
unknown. Here, we identified fibulin-3 as a secreted protein in the breast cancer
microenvironment, which efficiently inhibits TGF-β signaling in both breast cancer cells and
endothelial cells. Mechanistically, fibulin-3 interacts with the type I TGF-β receptor (TβRI) to
block TGF-β induced complex formation of TβRI with the type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII) and
subsequent downstream TGF-β signaling. Fibulin-3 expression decreases during breast cancer
progression, with low fibulin-3 levels correlating with a poorer prognosis. Functionally, high
fibulin-3 levels inhibited TGF-β-induced EMT, migration, invasion and endothelial permeability,
while loss of fibulin-3 expression/function promoted these TGF-β-mediated effects. Further,
restoring fibulin-3 expression in breast cancer cells inhibited TGF-β signaling, breast cancer cell
EMT, invasion and metastasis in vivo. These studies provide a novel mechanism for how TGF-β
signaling is regulated by the tumor microenvironment, and provide insight into targeting the TGFβ signaling pathway in human breast cancer patients.

cancer each year, underscoring the need to define mechanisms of breast cancer initiation and
progression.

Cytokines and growth factors, including the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)
superfamily, have important roles in breast cancer initiation and progression1–4. TGF-β is a
prototypic family member of 33 secreted structurally related cytokines, including TGF-β,
activin, nodal, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). TGF-β signaling has dual roles
during breast cancer progression5–7. In normal breast tissue and during the early stages of
breast cancer initiation, the TGF-β signaling pathway functions as a tumor suppressor via
suppressing proliferation, while promoting differentiation and apoptosis. However, in the
later stages of breast cancer progression, the TGF-β signaling pathway acts as a tumor
promoter, driving cell migration, invasion and metastasis, at least in part, via inducing
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The dual roles of the TGF-β signaling pathway
during breast cancer progression suggest tight control and regulation of this pathway during
breast cancer progression.

Author Manuscript

The canonical TGF-β superfamily signaling pathway is triggered when TGF-β superfamily
ligands bind to cell surface receptors, including co-receptors, type II, and type I receptors.
Upon ligand binding, these receptors form complexes, which facilitate the
transphosphorylation and activation of TβRI by TβRII; the TβRI then phosphorylates
receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), which bind the co-Smad, Smad4, and accumulate in
the nucleus where they act in concert with co-activators and co-repressors to regulate target
gene expression8–14. Although mechanisms by which TGF-β signaling is regulated by the
cellular machinery is widely and extensively studied5, 6, 15–18, how the breast cancer
microenvironment, which has important roles in mediating breast cancer progression19–21,
regulates TGF-β signaling during breast cancer progression remains largely unknown.

Author Manuscript

The breast and breast cancer microenvironment consists of extracellular matrix (ECM),
stromal cells (e.g. endothelial cells, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and leukocytes), and
cytokines, chemokine and proteins secreted by breast epithelial, breast cancer or stromal
cells22. Both cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions modify the proliferation,
survival, polarity, differentiation and invasive capacity of mammary epithelial cells. Most of
these effects are mediated by these secreted proteins, including TGF-β superfamily
cytokines23–25. In addition to cytokines, secreted proteins21, 26,27 and exosomes28–30 can
cooperate or regulate these cytokines to control breast cancer progression. Indeed, we have
previously established that decreases in shed soluble type III TGF-β receptor (sTβRIII)
increases TGF-β signaling in the tumor microenvironment to generate an immunotolerant
tumor microenvironment in breast cancer26, and promote breast cancer metastasis27. In
addition, the secreted protein Coco was recently demonstrated to inhibit BMP signaling to
reactivate dormant breast cancer lung micrometastasis31. However, how secreted proteins in
the breast cancer microenvironment regulate breast cancer progression still remains poorly
understood.
The fibulins are a family of secreted proteins that associate with the extracellular matrix
(ECM) scaffold, forming anchoring structures that can regulate cell proliferation and

migration32–34. Seven fibulin family members have been identified, with family members
defined by the presence of two structural modules, a tandem repeat of epidermal growth
factor-like modules and a unique C-terminal fibulin-type module. The FBLN-3 gene (also
called EFEMP1) encodes fibulin-3, and is a relatively recent addition to the family.
Fibulin-3 has been reported to be downregulated in several solid tumors35, including breast
cancer, via aberrant promoter methylation36–38, with loss of fibulin-3 expression associated
with tumor progression, metastasis and a poor patient prognosis. Although fibulin-3 has
been reported to regulate some signaling pathways including the MAPK7, Akt7, 39 Notch40
and Wnt41 signaling pathways, the role of fibulin-3 in the TGF-β signaling pathway has not
been investigated. Here we utilize a proteomic approach to investigate the role of secreted
proteins in regulating TGF-β signaling in the breast cancer tumor microenvironment.

Conditioned media from breast cancer cells inhibits TGF-β signaling

Author Manuscript

To investigate whether there were components in the breast cancer microenvironment which
regulate TGF-β signaling, we examined the effects of conditioned media from the estrogen
receptor negative human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MD-231 cells, on TGF-β and BMP2
signaling. Pretreating MDA-MB-231 cells with conditioned media dramatically inhibited
TGF-β induced Smad2 phosphorylation and AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 1A), while only
slightly inhibiting BMP-2 induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). As stromal cells,
including endothelial and immune cells, interact and regulate breast cancer cells, we next
asked whether the breast cancer conditioned media also regulates TGF-β signaling in
endothelial cells. Pretreating human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) with MDAMB-231 conditioned media inhibited TGF-β induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, increased
basal Smad2 phosphorylation, inhibited TGF-β induced Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C)
and TGF-β induced transcription of its downstream genes, including Smad7 and
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (Fig. 1D). However, MDA-MB-231 conditioned
media had no effect on BMP-9 signaling in endothelial cells (Fig. 1C, 1D). In addition, the
conditioned media from the estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer line, MCF-7,
also inhibited TGF-β induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner in
HMEC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1A). However, only high doses of conditioned media
increased basal Smad2 phosphorylation, while inhibiting TGF-β induced Smad2
phosphorylation in HMEC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1A), and having no effect on BMP-9
signaling (Supplementary Fig. 1B). These results suggest that there are active components in
the conditioned media from breast cancer cells that inhibit TGF-β signaling, without
effecting BMP-9 signaling.

Author Manuscript

As the overall effect of conditioned media from breast cancer cells integrates the effects of
secreted TGF-β ligands, TGF-β activators and repressors, to identify the active components
responsible for inhibiting TGF-β signaling, the conditioned media from MDA-MB-231 cells
was fractionated using FPLC gel filtration (Supplementary Fig. 1C) and the fractions
screened for inhibitory activity. The eluted fractions were combined into groups based on
their elution peaks (Supplementary Fig. 1C) and used to pretreat HMEC-1 cells. Compared
to the other combined fractions, fractions 17–26 inhibited TGF-β induced Smad1/5/8 and

Smad2 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Further, individual fractions 17, 18, 19
and 20 inhibited TGF-β induced Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1E), suggesting these
fractions contained the active components responsible for mediating inhibition of TGF-β
signaling. The proteins in fractions, and their adjacent fractions, were resolved by SDSPAGE and detected by silver nitrate staining (Supplementary Fig. 1E). The two bands that
were enriched in fractions 17–20 relative to adjacent fractions were cut out and subjected to
mass spectrometry analysis, resulting in the identification of 15 candidate proteins
(Supplementary Table 1).

Three of the identified candidates proteins were secreted proteins (Supplementary Table 1),
including EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (fibulin-3, FBLN3),
serum albumin, and transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3 (βIGH3). As
exogenous serum albumin did not regulate TGF-β induced Smad2 phosphorylation in MDAMB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A), and decreasing βIGH3 levels in MDA-MB-231
conditioned media by either immunodepletion (Supplementary Fig. 2B) or stable
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 2C, 2D) further decreased TGF-β induced Smad1/2/5/8
phosphorylation in HMEC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2B and 2E), we turned our attention
to fibulin-3, which has been demonstrated to regulate other signaling pathways7, 39, 40. As
MDA-MB-231 cells express and secrete high levels of fibulin-3 (Fig. 4H, Supplementary
Fig. 2H), we used shRNA to stably silence fibulin-3 expression and secretion
(Supplementary Fig. 2F-H) in MDA-MB-231 cells (shFBLN3-MDA-MB-231), with a nontargeted shRNA control (shNTC-MDA-MB-231). In the presence of blank medium, TGF-β
induced Smad2 phosphorylation in both shNTC-MDA-MB-231 and shFBLN3-MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 2A). However, consistent with our prior results, conditioned media from
shNTC-MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited TGF-β induced Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A,
Supplementary Fig. 2L) and TGF-β-induced transcription of its downstream genes, Smad7
(Fig. 2B) and PAI-1 (Fig. 2C), while conditioned media from shFBLN3-MDA-MD-231
cells failed to inhibit TGF-β induced Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) or TGF-β induced
Smad7 (Fig. 2B) or PAI-1 (Fig. 2C) transcription. Similarly, conditioned media from
shFBLN3-MDA-MD-231 cells did not inhibit TGF-β induced Smad1/5/8 and Smad2
phosphorylation in HMEC-1 cells (Fig. 2D) or in colon fibroblast 18Co cells
(Supplementary Fig. 2I). Further, MDA-MB-231 conditioned media immunodepleted with
two different anti-fibulin-3 antibodies did not inhibit TGF-β induced Smad1/2/5/8
phosphorylation (Fig. 2E, Supplementary Fig. 2J). In a reciprocal manner, the highly
metastatic MDA-MB-231-4175 subline expressed and secreted low levels of fibulin-3 (Fig.
4H, Supplementary Fig. 2H), and as expected, its conditioned media did not inhibit TGF-β
induced Smad phosphorylation or Smad7 and PAI-1 transcription in MDA-MAMB-231-4175 (Fig. 2F, 2G, 2H, Supplementary Fig. 2L) or HMEC-1 cells (Fig. 2I).
However, the conditioned media from MDA-MB-231-4175 cells stably overexpressing
fibulin-3 (Supplementary Fig. 2H, 2K) inhibited TGF-β signaling (Fig. 2F, 2I) and TGF-β
induced genes transcription (Fig. 2G, 2H). Moreover, exogenous fibulin-3 inhibited TGF-β
induced Smad1/2/5/8 phosphorylation and Smad7 and PAI-1 transcription in HMEC-1 cells
(Fig. 2J) and in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figs. 3A, 2K, 2L). In addition, pretreating MDAMB-231 cells with recombinant fibulin-3 also inhibited TGF-β induced p38 phosphorylation

(Supplementary Fig. 2M). Consistent with the previous report7, fibulin-3 increased basal
AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, while inhibiting TGF-β induced AKT and ERK1/2
phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 2M). As fibulin-3 inhibits lung cancer metastasis via
suppressing the ERK-Wnt/β-catenin signaling axis41, we test whether fibulin-3 inhibits this
pathway in breast cancer cells. Knockdown of fibulin-3 had no effect on β-catenin nuclear
translocation (Supplementary Fig. 2N) and ERK phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 2O).
Taken together, these data indicate that fibulin-3 is the active component in the breast cancer
secretome that inhibits both canonical and non-canonical TGF-β signaling in breast cancer
epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts.
Fibulin-3 inhibits TGF-β signaling via interaction with TβRI to decrease TβRI/TβRII complex
formation

Author Manuscript

Having defined fibulin-3 as an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling, we turned our attention to
defining the mechanism by which fibulin-3 inhibits TGF-β signaling. Fibulin-3-mediated
inhibition of TGF-β signaling did not require protein synthesis or degradation, as pretreating
cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, the proteasome inhibitor, MG132,
or the lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitor, leupeptin, did not diminish the effect of
conditioned media in inhibiting TGF-β signaling (Supplementary Fig. 3A, 3B). We next
assessed whether fibulin-3 inhibits TGF-β signaling by binding and sequestering TGF-β
ligand. Compared with soluble TβRIII, which, as expected, efficiently bound TGF-β27,
fibulin-3 did not directly bind TGF-β1 (Supplementary Fig. 3C).

To investigate whether fibulin-3 inhibited TGF-β induced Smad2 phosphorylation upstream
or downstream of TβRI, we investigated the effects of exogeneous fibulin-3 on ligand versus
constitutively activated TβRI induced Smad2 phosphorylation. While exogeneous fibulin-3
inhibited TGF-β ligand induced Smad2 phosphorylation, it did not inhibit constitutively
activated TβRI mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 3A), suggesting that fibulin-3
inhibits TGF-β signaling upstream of TβRI activation. As fibulin-3 binds with receptors
from other families, including the EGF receptor7, we tested whether fibulin-3 could form
complexes with TGF-β receptors, including TβRI and TβRII, to potentially inhibit TβRI
activation. TβRI, and to a lesser extent for TβRII, co-immunoprecipitated with fibulin-3 in
COS7 cells co-expressing fibulin-3 and TβRI or TβRII (Fig. 3B). In a reciprocal manner,
fibulin-3 also co-immunoprecipitated with TβRI but not TβRII (Fig. 3C). Further, purified
recombinant fibulin-3 co-immunoprecipitated with TβRI but not TβRII (Fig. 3D). As
fibulin-3 is a secreted protein, we expressed and purified cellular HA-TβRI and HA-TβRII
from COS7 cells using anti-HA beads, and tested whether TβRI or TβRII formed a complex
with fibulin-3 in the conditioned media. HA-TβRI, but not TβRII formed a higher molecular
weight complex with fibulin-3 (Supplementary Fig. 3D), suggesting that fibulin-3 may
inhibit TGF-β signaling through interaction with TβRI.
We then investigated whether the interaction between fibulin-3 and TβRI blocked TGF-β
induced TβRI/TβRII complex formation, which is an essential step for downstream TGF-β
signaling11, 42, 43. While conditioned media from control MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3E) or
recombinant fibulin-3 (Supplementary Fig. 3E) inhibited TGF-β-induced TβRI/TβRII
complex formation, conditioned media from shFBLN3-MDA-MB-231 cells failed to inhibit

TGF-β induced TβRI/TβRII complex formation (Fig. 3E). Finally, as the TGF-β signaling
pathway is subject to multiple levels of regulation, we assessed the effects of TGF-β on
fibulin-3 levels. TGF-β induced fibulin-3 expression in a time dependent manner in both
MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-231-4175 cells (Fig. 3F). Collectively, these data
indicate that fibulin-3 inhibits TGF-β signaling in a negative feedback loop through
interaction with TβRI to inhibit TβRI/TβRII complex formation (Fig. 8A).
Fibulin-3 expression is decreased during breast cancer progression

Having identified fibulin-3 as a novel and key suppressor of TGF-β signaling in the breast
cancer microenvironment, we next investigated whether fibulin-3 expression changes during
breast cancer progression. In a meta-analysis of 32 publically available datasets on
Oncomine, fibulin-3 expression was decreased in breast cancer compared to normal breast
(Fig. 4A). Further, while normal mammary epithelial tissue expressed high levels of
fibulin-3, human breast cancer orthotopic xenograft expressed very low levels of fibulin-3
(Fig. 4B). In addition, compared to normal breast, fibulin-3 levels were decreased in basal,
Her2, luminal A and luminal B subtypes of breast cancers (Supplementary Fig. 4A),
suggesting that decreased fibulin-3 expression is general feature of breast cancer
progression. Moreover, relative to normal breast, fibulin-3 expression decreased beginning
in Stage I breast cancer, with more pronounced decreases in stage IV breast cancer (Fig.
4C), and relative to pre-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), fibulin-3 expression
decreased in both invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC,
Fig. 4D). Further, low expression level of fibulin-3 correlated with worse survival in breast
cancer patients (http://kmplot.com/analysis/) (Fig. 4E). These data support an important role
for fibulin-3 in breast cancer progression. Consistent with this hypothesis, in the MCF10A
breast cancer progression series44, with MCF10A cells being non-tumorigenic, MCF10AT1k cells forming hyperplastic lesions, MCF10A-CA1h cells forming low-grade, welldifferentiated carcinomas and MCF10A-CA1a cells forming poorly differentiated,
metastatic carcinomas, fibulin-3 mRNA levels progressively decreased with cancer
progression (Fig. 4F). In addition, compared to the non-metastatic cell line, MCF10A-CA1h,
fibulin-3 protein levels in the conditioned media were dramatically decreased in metastatic
MCF10A-CA1a cells (Fig. 4G). Consistent with a prior report45, fibulin-3 mRNA levels
were also decreased in the metastatic MDA-MB-231-4175 subline compared with the
poorly-metastatic parental MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4H). In addition, in the isogenic murine
mammary carcinoma progression series, composed of four murine mammary carcinoma cell
lines (67NR, 168FARN, 4TO7 and 4T1), each with progressive metastatic potential but all
derived from same parental breast tumor46, fibulin-3 mRNA levels were decreased in
metastatic 4T1 cells relative to the other nonmetastatic cells (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Thus,
in all series, fibulin-3 expression was lost as cells acquired metastatic capability.
As the fibulin-3 promoter has CpG islands (Supplementary Fig. 4C) and has been reported
to be regulated by promoter methylation36–38, we investigated the potential for epigenetic
regulation in our model systems. Treating 4T1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4D) or MDAMB-231-4175 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4E) with the promoter methylation inhibitor, 5azacytidine, increased fibulin-3mRNA levels in both cell lines. These data suggest that

fibulin-3 expression is decreased via either direct or indirect epigenetic silencing during
breast cancer progression.
Decreased fibulin-3 promotes TGF-β induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
migration and invasion in vitro

Author Manuscript

As fibulin-3 inhibits TGF-β signaling in breast cancer cells and fibulin-3 expression
decreases during breast cancer progression, especially in invasive breast cancer and at the
later stages of breast cancer progression, we next investigated the effects of fibulin-3 on
TGF-β-induced migration and invasion. While conditioned media from poorly-metastatic
parental MDA-MB-231 cells with high fibulin-3 expression45 (Fig. 4H, Supplementary Fig.
2H) inhibited TGF-β induced migration (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. 5A) and invasion (Fig.
5B), conditioned media from shFBLN3-MDA-MB-231 failed to inhibit TGF-β’s effects
(Fig. 5A, B). Although TGF-β was not able to induce migration in MDA-MB-231-4175 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5B), TGF-β induced their invasion (Fig. 5C), and conditioned media
from MDA-MB-231-4175 cells with low fibulin-3 expression45 (Fig. 4H, Supplementary
Fig. 2H) was not able to inhibit TGF-β induced invasion (Fig. 5C). However, the
conditioned media from MDA-MB-231-4175 stably overexpressing fibulin-3 inhibited
TGF-β’s effects (Fig. 5C), supporting that fibulin-3 mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling
is sufficient to block TGF-β functions during breast cancer progression. In addition,
consistent with fibulin-3 having no effect on the ERK-Wnt signaling axis in breast cancer
cells (Supplementary Fig. 2N, 2O), silencing fibulin-3 expression had no significant effects
on MDA-MB-231 cell migration in the presence or absence of the Wnt pathway inhibitor,
IWP-2, (Supplementary Fig. 5C).

As EMT is important for breast cancer metastasis and TGF-β is a strong EMT inducer, we
next investigated whether decreased fibulin-3 promotes EMT by enhancing TGF-β signaling
in normal mouse mammary epithelial cells (NMuMG), which have been widely used as an
EMT model. TGF-β induced Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D) and EMT in blank medium
as detected by changes in cell morphology (Fig. 5E) and EMT marker expression, including
upregulation of fibronectin and downregulation of E-cadherin (Fig. 5F). While conditioned
media from NMuMG cells decreased TGF-β induced Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D) and
EMT (Fig. 5E, F), the conditioned media from shFBLN3-NMUMG cells was not able to
inhibit TGF-β’s effects (Fig. 5D, E, F). Consistent with an effect on EMT, fibulin-3 (Fig.
5G) and ZO-1 (Fig. 5H) mRNA levels decreased, with their expression positively
correlating (TCGA data base: Q-value=2.6e-11; METABRIC database: Q-value=2.5e-02),
while PAI-1, a TGF-β downstream gene (Fig. 5I), and fibronectin (Fig. 5J) mRNA levels
increased in breast tumor tissue compared with their paired normal breast tissue in 92
normal-tumor pairs from the TCGA dataset. Collectively, these data indicate that decreased
fibulin-3 expression during breast cancer progression may promote TGF-β induced breast
cancer cell EMT, migration and invasion.
Decreased fibulin-3 enhances TGF-β’s effects on endothelial sprouting and
transendothelial cell migration
As fibulin-3 inhibits TGF-β signaling in endothelial cells, we investigated fibulin-3’s roles
in endothelial biology. While conditioned media from metastatic MDA-MB-231-4175

cells45 with very low fibulin-3 expression (Fig. 4H, Supplementary Fig. 2H) did not inhibit
TGF-β-mediated decreases in sprouting as detected by spheroid-based sprout assay, the
conditioned media from MDA-MB-231-4175 stably overexpressing fibulin-3 inhibited
TGF-β-mediated decreases in sprouting (Fig. 6A and 6B). In addition, while TGF-β did not
decrease sprouting in the conditioned media from poorly-metastatic parental MDA-MB-231
cells45 with high fibulin-3 expression (Fig. 4H, Supplementary Fig. 2H), TGF-β decreased
sprouting in the presence of conditioned media from shFBLN3-MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
6C).

As breast cancer cell intravasation into or extravasation out of blood vessels are pivotal steps
for cancer metastasis, and both processes require transendothelial cell migration, we studied
the effect of fibulin-3 on transendothelial cell migration. While TGF-β increased
transendothelial cell migration in blank medium and in the conditioned media from
metastatic MDA-MB-231-4175 cells (Fig. 6D, E) with very low fibulin-3 expression45 (Fig.
4H, Supplementary Fig. 2H), conditioned media from MDA-MB-231-4175 cells stably
expressing fibulin-3 (Fig. 6D, E) or from poorly-metastatic parental MDA-MB-231 cells
(Fig. 6F) with high fibulin-3 expression45 (Fig. 4H, Supplementary Fig. 2H) inhibited TGFβ-increased transendothelial cell migration (Fig. 6D, E and F), while conditioned media
from MDA-MB-231-shFBLN3 cells restored TGF-β-increased transendothelial cell
migration (Fig. 6F). These data indicate that decreased fibulin-3 promotes TGF-β regulation
of endothelial sprouting and transendothelial cell migration to facilitate breast cancer
metastasis.
Overexpression of fibulin-3 inhibits breast cancer metastasis in vivo

To investigate whether the ability of fibulin-3 to inhibit TGF-β signaling in both breast
cancer and endothelial cell function in vitro had effects on breast cancer progression in vivo,
we injected MDA-MB-231-4175 stably expressing fibulin-3 into the inguinal mammary fat
pads of nude mice. While there were no effects on primary tumor growth (Fig. 7A),
fibulin-3 expression inhibited and delayed breast cancer metastasis (Fig. 7B, C). Further,
fibulin-3 expression also inhibited micrometastasis to the liver as detecting by staining with
anti-human vimentin (Fig. 2D). Expression of fibulin-3 also appeared to decrease cancer cell
invasiveness in vivo, decreasing the extent to which MDA-MB-231-4175 cancer cells
penetrated through smooth muscle layers (Black arrows, Fig. 7E). In addition, while the
control MDA-MB-231-4175 cells displayed an elongated, mesenchymal-phenotype,
fibulin-3 expression promoted a more cobble-stone epithelial morphology (Fig. 7F, G), and
increased pan-cytokeratin and decreased fibronectin expression relative to control MDAMB-231-4175 cells (Fig. 7G). Finally, fibulin-3 expressing MDA-MB-231-4175 tumors had
reduced nuclear p-Smad2 staining relative to control MDA-MB-231-4175 tumors (Fig. 7H).
Taken together, these data indicate that expression of fibulin-3 decreased TGF-β/Smad2
signaling and inhibited breast cancer EMT and metastasis in vivo.

Discussion
Here, we used an unbiased approach to identify fibulin-3 as a novel and key regulator of the
TGF-β signaling pathway in the breast cancer microenvironment (Fig. 8A). Fibulin-3

expression decreases during breast cancer progression, with decreased fibulin-3 promoting
TGF-β signaling and in turn promoting EMT, migration, invasion and transendothelial cell
migration of breast cancer cells (Fig. 8B). Mechanistically, fibulin-3 inhibits the TGF-β
pathway through interaction with TβRI and inhibition of TGF-β induced TβRI/TβRII
complex formation (Fig. 8A).

The TGF-β pathway is tightly regulated to have dual tumor suppressor and tumor promoter
roles during breast cancer progression5–7. Although mechanisms regulating the TGF-β
pathway within the cancer cell have been extensively studied, mechanisms by which the
tumor microenvironment might regulate TGF-β signaling are less defined. Importantly,
secreted proteins have the potential to coordinately regulate TGF-β signaling in the multiple
different cell types represented in the tumor microenvironment, including cancer cells,
endothelial cells, fibroblasts and immune cells. Here we identify fibulin-3 as one of those
secreted proteins, which can inhibit TGF-β signaling in cancer cells, endothelial cells and
fibroblast cells. Whether fibulin-3 also inhibits TGF-β signaling in other components of the
tumor microenvironment, including immune system cells, to mediate its effects on inhibiting
cancer progression remains to be explored. In addition, while the current studies focused on
breast cancer, fibulin-3 expression is also decreased in other cancers36, 47–49, suggesting that
loss of fibulin-3 expression may be a common mechanism by which TGF-β signaling is
increased to promote cancer progression.

In the context of breast cancer progression, the source, timing and mechanisms for loss of
fibulin-3 expression is critical and of potential translational relevance. Fibulin-3 is
ubiquitously expressed and secreted from all types of cells, including epithelial cells,
endothelial cells and fibroblast cells. However, in the context of the breast cancer
microenvironment, as breast cancer cells constitute the majority of cells, breast cancer cells
are likely the major source of fibulin-3. Here we demonstrate that fibulin-3 expression
decreases during breast cancer progression, particularly from breast cancer cells and in
human breast cancer specimens, with this loss occurring primarily as the breast cancer cell
acquires invasive capabilities (Fig. 4). In this context, high levels of fibulin-3 expressed and
secreted by normal breast epithelial and pre-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ cells may
function to inhibit the effects of TGF-β on the stroma in the early tumor microenvironment,
with losses in expression during cancer progression promoting TGF-β signaling at the same
time as the cancer cells become unresponsive via mutation or loss of receptor or Smad
expression, increasing the tumor promoting effects of TGF-β signaling. This scenario is
consistent with the role of enhanced TGF-β signaling in promoting tumor metastasis in the
late stages of breast cancer. We provide preliminary evidence for epigenetic regulation
mediating loss of fibulin-3, as has been reported in other tumor types37, 47–49. These results
raise the exciting possibility that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in clinical use could
increase fibulin-3 levels and provide therapeutic benefit in this manner.
Our studies with conditioned media from breast cancer cells demonstrated a predominant
effect on inhibiting TGF-β signaling, with more subtle effects on BMP-2 signaling (Fig. 1B),
and no effects on BMP-9 signaling (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Figure 1B). However, in many
cases we also observed an effect of conditioned media on increasing basal p-Smad2 levels
(Fig. 1C, E, Supplementary Figure 1A). As the conditioned media contains secreted TGF-β

superfamily ligands, shed TGF-β superfamily receptors and other TGF-β superfamily
activators and repressors, the observed effects of conditioned media may be due to the
integrated effects of these components, in particular, TGF-β superfamily ligands that can
stimulate Smad2 phosphorylation (i.e. activin and BMP). In addition to fibulin-3, we also
identified another TGF-β regulator in the breast cancer conditioned media, βIGH3. Although
its effects on TGF-β signaling were subtle, knockdown of βIGH3 suppressed TGF-β
signaling, suggesting that it may function to promote TGF-β signaling. How the effects of
the complex cancer microenvironment secretome are integrated to regulate cancer
progression is currently being explored.
In summary, these studies provide a novel mechanism for how TGF-β signaling is regulated
by the tumor microenvironment, and provide insight into targeting the TGF-β signaling
pathway for the benefit of human cancer patients.

Transendothelial migration

Author Manuscript

1x105 HMEC-1 cells were cultured on top of 24-well membrane of transwells until they
formed a monolayer, and treated with conditioned media from breast cancer cells with or
without 50 pM TGF-β1 for 12h. 1X105 GFP-labelled breast cancer cells were plated with
serum free medium on the top of endothelial layers in a transwell. Media containing 0.5%
BSA was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Twenty-four hours later, the
cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by gently scrubbing with a cotton swab.
Transendothelial migration of breast cancer cells was then assessed by fluorescent
microscopy.
Duolink assay

Author Manuscript

The Duolink assay (Olink Bioscience) was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with breast cancer conditioned media
or 200 ng/ml recombinant fibulin-3, and treated with 50 pM TGF-β1 for 10min. Cells were
then washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton
X-100/PBS for 5 min and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h.
Slides were incubated with anti-TβRI, and anti-TβRII (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc)
primary antibodies for 1hrs in room temperature and then incubated with PLA probe
MINUS and PLUS mixture for 1h at 37°C. After ligation for 30min, and amplification for
100min at 37°C, the slides were labeled with DAPI, mounted with Prolong Anti-Fade
(Sigma), digitally imaged and counted for number of the red dots per cells manually using
ImageJ software.
In vivo tumorigenicity and metastasis

Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-231-4175-Luc cells stably expressing firefly luciferase gene were infected with
either an empty vector (EV) as control or fibulin-3 overexpression pBABE retrovirus, and
stably infected cells were selected using 1 μg/ml puromycin for 72 hrs. EV and fibulin-3
overexpressing cells were implanted (50,000 cells/mouse) into the right-side inguinal
mammary fat pads of female BALB/c mice. Starting from day 7, tumor growth and tumor
metastasis were recorded by bioluminescence.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined by
the two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA, followed by the LSD-t test for multiple
comparisons. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To
examine the statistical interaction between fibulin-3 expression and ligand treatment, 2-way
ANOVA was performed with specific interest in the interaction term.

Fig. 6. Loss of fibulin-3 enhances TGF-β induced transendothelial cell migration

Author Manuscript

(A, B, C) HMEC-1 cells were cultured in hanging drops to make spheroids. Endothelial
spheroids were seeded on Matrigel with conditioned media from empty vector or fibulin-3
stably overexpressing MDA-MB-231-4175 cells (A and B), or from shNTC-or shFBLN3MDA-MB-231 cells (C), treated without or with 50 pM TGF-β1, and cultured overnight.
The number of sprouts were counted and the length of every vessels were measured using
Image J. Quantitated data were from 3 experiments +/− SEM. (D, E, F) A confluent
endothelial monolayer growing in transwells was cultured in conditioned media from empty
vector or fibulin-3 stably overexpressing MDA-MB-231-4175 cells (D and E), or from
shNTC- and shFBLN3-MDA-MB-231 cells (F), treated without or with 50 pM TGF-β1 for
12 hrs. GFP labelled breast cancer cells were then plated on the top of transwell and allowed
to migrate for 24 hrs, with the number of cells undergoing transendothelial cell migration
(TEM) quantitated. Quantitated data were from 3 experiments +/− SEM.

Fig. 7. Fibulin-3 inhibits breast cancer EMT, invasiveness and metastasis in vivo

(A) MDA-MB-231-4175-vector (EV) or MDA-MB-231-4175-fibulin-3 cells (FBLN3)
(50,000 cells/mouse) were implanted into the inguinal mammary fat pads of female nude
mice. Primary tumor growth was recorded by measuring tumor size at 6 weeks after
injection presented as mean ± SEM (A). Metastasis was followed by bioluminescence
imaging every 7 postoperative days (POD) (B, C). (D) Tissue sections of liver from mice
implanted with MDA-MB-231-4175-vector (EV) or MDA-MB-231-4175-fibulin-3 cells
(FBLN3) were immunostained with anti-human vimentin antibody. (E, F) Primary tumors

Fig. 8. Fibulin-3-mediated regulation of TGF-β signaling and biology

Author Manuscript

(A) TGF-β induces fibulin-3 expression and secretion. Fibulin-3 inhibits TGF-β signaling by
interaction with TβRI, blocking complex formation with TβRII and downstream signaling.
(B) Fibulin-3 expression decreases during breast cancer progression, with decreased
fibulin-3 promoting TGF-β signaling in breast cancer cells and endothelial cells, and in turn
promoting EMT, migration, invasion in breast cancer cells and endothelial permeability,
collectively promoting metastasis.
