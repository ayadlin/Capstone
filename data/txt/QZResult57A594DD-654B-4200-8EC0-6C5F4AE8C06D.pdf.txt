BACKGROUND: The drug approval timeline is a lengthy process that often varies between countries. The objective of this study was
to delineate the Canadian drug approval timeline for oncology drugs and to compare the time to drug approval between Health Canada (HC) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: In total, 54 antineoplastic drugs that were approved by the
FDA between 1989 and 2012 were reviewed. For each drug, the following milestones were determined: the dates of submission and
approval for both the FDA and HC and the dates of availability on provincial drug formularies in Canadian provinces and territories.
The time intervals between the aforementioned milestones were calculated. RESULTS: Of 54 FDA-approved drugs, 49 drugs were
approved by HC at the time of the current study. The median time from submission to approval was 9 months (interquartile range
[IQR], 6-14.5 months) for the FDA and 12 months (IQR, 10-21.1 months) for HC (P <.0006). The time from HC approval to the placement of a drug on a provincial drug formulary was a median of 16.7 months (IQR, 5.9-27.2 months), and there was no interprovincial
variability among the 5 Canadian provinces that were analyzed (P 5.5). CONCLUSIONS: The time from HC submission to HC approval
takes 3 months longer than the same time interval for the FDA. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first documentation of the
time required to bring an oncology drug from HC submission to placement on a provincial drug formulary. Cancer 2015;121:1688-93.

INTRODUCTION
Differences in drug approval processes between countries can impact patient access to new therapies. The regulatory
review process is lengthy, and, in some countries, such as the United States, regulations like Accelerated Approval (AA)
and the Orphan Drug Act have been implemented to improve access to therapeutics for life-threatening or rare diseases
like cancer.1,2 Downing et al compared applications for the approval of 289 unique, novel therapeutic agents from 2001
to 2010 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Health Canada
(HC).3 Only 72 agents were approved by all 3 regulatory agencies. The total review time was significantly faster for the
FDA (median, 303 days; interquartile range [IQR], 185-372 days) compared with the EMA (median, 366 days; IQR,
310-445 days) and HC (median, 352 days; IQR, 255-420 days; P < .001).
In the United States, drugs are generally available to all states after FDA approval. In Canada, the drug approval process begins after HC receives a new drug submission application by the drug company. Subsequently, drug safety, efficacy,
and quality data are evaluated to assess the potential risks and benefits of the drug. After HC approval, provincial health
ministries make independent decisions regarding funding for HC-approved drugs. After approval by the provincial health
ministry, a drug is placed on the provincial formulary and is routinely available for patients who meet prespecified indications. This introduces interprovincial variability with respect to which drugs are approved for funding and the length of
time required for final approval.
The objective of the current study was to delineate the Canadian drug approval timeline for anticancer drugs and to
compare the time to drug approval between HC and the FDA. Milestones in the process were determined, including the
date of submission to the regulatory authority, the date of regulatory approval, and the date of placement on a provincial
formulary. In light of the increasing use of targeted anticancer therapy, comparison was made between these novel agents
and traditional cytotoxic agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antineoplastic drugs that were approved by the FDA
from 1989 to 2012 were identified (n 5 54). For each
drug, the following information was extracted: therapeutic indication; FDA submission date for a New Drug
Application or, for a recombinant protein or vaccine, a
Biologics License Application4; and the earliest corresponding HC Notice of Compliance date.5,6 For HCapproved drugs, we sought to determine the date that the
drug was placed on the respective provincial formulary
(the provincial drug approval date). Information was
requested from cancer center pharmacists, pharmaceutical
companies, provincial cancer websites, provincial Ministries of Health, and practicing medical oncologists for all
provinces and territories across Canada. The 5 provinces
studied were Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Newfoundland. These provinces were chosen
for analysis because of the availability of provincial formulary information. Other provinces and territories were
excluded from the study because of limited data, which
would have precluded meaningful statistical comparisons.
These 5 provinces reflect the heterogeneity of the Canadian population, because they range in population from
500,000 (Newfoundland) to 12 million (Ontario). In
addition, these provinces span the Canadian geographic
landscape, with 2 provinces from Western Canada
(Alberta and British Columbia), 2 provinces from Central
and Eastern Canada (Manitoba and Ontario, respectively), and 1 province from Atlantic Canada (NewfoundCancer

land). The geographic distribution of Canada’s
population is also relatively uniform across the 5 provinces
studied, because the majority of Canadians live in urban
centers where access to medical care is readily available.
For each drug, time intervals were calculated for
drug submission and approval dates (FDA and HC) and
for Canadian provincial drug approval dates. Subgroups
were analyzed for the time interval from HC approval to
provincial availability for the 5 provinces. In light of the
escalating cost of targeted agents, we conducted an exploratory subgroup analysis according to drug mechanism of
action: cytotoxic versus targeted therapy. Only 5 new hormone therapies were approved during the time frame of
this study; therefore, those drugs were excluded from the
mechanism-of-action comparison. Data analysis, including hormone therapies, did not affect any of the timelines
studied.
Statistical analyses involved comparisons of median
values for the above-defined time intervals. Median values
were chosen rather than the means because of the heavily
skewed nature of the data. Comparisons were made using
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Wilcoxon analyses of variance for nonparametric data. All tests of significance (P
values) were 2-sided. Statistical significance was represented by P < .05.
RESULTS
The FDA approved 54 antineoplastic drugs from 1989 to
2012 that had accessible approval indication records (Fig.

from FDA submission to approval was 8.9 months (IQR,
6.0-14.5 months) compared with 12.2 months from HC
submission to approval (P 5 .0006) (Table 1). A subgroup analysis of oncology drugs by mechanism of action
revealed no difference in time from HC/FDA submission
to approval for cytotoxic versus targeted drugs (FDA,
P 5 .25; HC, P 5 .13) (Table 2).

FDA approval occurred before HC approval for
87.5% of new oncology drug indications (Fig. 2). Similarly, drugs were submitted to the FDA before HC submission in 87% of cases. Drugs were already approved by
the FDA before HC submission in 23% of cases. There
were only 7 drugs that were approved by HC before FDA
approval within a median of 23 months (range, 2.0-118
months). The drugs that were approved by HC first are
listed in Figure 2. FDA approval before HC submission
occurred in 11 drugs and did not influence or accelerate
the time to HC approval (P 5 .5) (Table 3). Six drugs
were approved by HC before the FDA (Table 3). These
drugs had shorter submission-to-approval times (9
months) compared with drugs that obtained HC approval
after FDA approval (13 months; P 5 .03).
Provincial drug formulary approval dates were available for 41 of 49 (84%) HC-approved drugs in Alberta;
however, less complete but comparable information was
available for the other provinces studied (Table 4). The median time from HC approval to placement on provincial
drug formulary was approximately 16.7 months in Alberta
(IQR, 5.9-27.2 months), similar to the median time for all
provinces combined (16.7 months; IQR, 7.5-32.6
months). There was no interprovincial difference in the
time from HC approval to provincial availability (P 5 .50)
for the 5 provinces analyzed. The median time from FDA
approval to placement on the Alberta formulary was 30.1
months (IQR, 16.2-43.6 months) (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
Our analysis of anticancer drugs approved by the FDA
and HC between 1989 and 2012 describes the variability
in the drug approval process between Canada and the
United States. During the period of our study, 87% of
new drugs were submitted to the FDA before HC submission. Within the limitations of the small sample size, the
time from HC submission to approval was not impacted
Cancer

by the agency to which the drug was first submitted (HC
or FDA).
In a review of all drugs (oncology and nononcology)
submitted to HC from 2000 to 2011, a mean delay of
540 days was observed for Canadian submissions compared with the FDA or the EMA.7 We observed that the
process from oncology drug submission to approval took
approximately 3 months longer in Canada than in the
United States. Downing and colleagues recently reviewed
the approval process for novel therapeutics (including
anticancer and noncancer drugs) and demonstrated that
the FDA provides more rapid review times (by approximately 50 days) compared with HC.3 Our study focused
specifically on oncology drugs that were approved by the
FDA and HC and delineated the drug approval process in
Canada after HC approval. Some differences between our
metric of review time and that of Downing et al should be
noted. The review time used by Downing et al comprised
the time from application for submission to completion
of the first review (the date on which the regulatory agency
notified the applicant of the first decision), which may not
always mark the end of the review process. This date differs from the HC Notice of Compliance date used in our
study, which is the date on which a pharmaceutical company can start to market a novel drug. The approval dates
used in our study represented the final approval dates for
the respective regulatory agencies. Furthermore, it should
be noted that the HC approval date does not reflect the
true time to drug approval in Canada, because drugs still
need to be placed on provincial formularies, and we
observed that this process can be lengthy. Streamlining
the HC approval process as well as facilitating and encouraging simultaneous submission to HC and the FDA could
potentially accelerate drug access for Canadians.
In Alberta, drug placement on the provincial formulary occurred about 16.7 months after HC approval, and
no interprovincial variability was noted among the 5 provinces studied. We observed that the median time from
FDA approval to Alberta provincial approval was

approximately 30.1 months. This represents the median
time from when an oncology drug becomes available in
the United States to the time for the same drug to be listed
on the Alberta formulary. To place this in context, the median survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
and metastatic breast cancer is approximately 25
months.8,9
Regulatory agencies do not differentiate between targeted and cytotoxic drugs when reviewing an application
for approval. The FDA will grant accelerated approval if
there are no other drugs available for the specific patient
population.1 Because of the relatively small number of
drugs in this study, we did not evaluate whether the time
from HC approval to placement on a provincial formulary depended on the availability of other therapeutic
options. The time from HC approval to placement on a
provincial formulary was shorter for cytotoxic drugs than
for targeted drugs in Alberta, but there was no significant
difference in the other provinces evaluated.
Of the 49 HC-approved anticancer drugs in this
study, 96% (n 5 47) were available in British Columbia,
84% (n 5 41) were available in Alberta, and 78%
(n 5 38) were available in Ontario. In contrast, in a previous study evaluating 24 HC-approved anticancer drugs,
79% were available in British Columbia, whereas only
46% were accessible in Ontario.10 Despite these differences, it should be noted that patients may still have access
to drugs when they are not yet on a provincial formulary
through several mechanisms, such as the HC Special
Access Programs, third-party health insurance, participation in clinical trials, and patient payment of drug costs.
This variability does not represent universal access and often involves extra time and resources from clinicians and
patients. Canada has established a national agency to
review new oncology drugs to make the provincial drug
approval process more efficient and transparent.11 The
1692

Canadian oncology drug review agency was established in
2012 to provide evidence-based recommendations for
cancer drugs by reviewing clinical evidence, cost effectiveness, and patient perspectives. The Canadian oncology
drug review agency will evaluate a new drug before the
Notice of Compliance if HC is “highly likely” to approve
the drug within 6 months of a submission, which can
potentially accelerate the drug approval process. After a
positive Canadian oncology drug review recommendation, however, each province still makes an independent
decision regarding formulary listing. In addition, some
new targeted oncology drugs have made modest yet statistically significant improvements in patient outcomes but
are not clinically relevant based on high cost or limited
impact to quality of life. These factors will continue to
influence funding decisions regarding the placement of a
new drug on provincial formularies.
Some study limitations should be noted. Despite
contacting all provincial health ministries and medical
oncologists across Canada, only 5 provinces provided sufficient information for inclusion; therefore, broad conclusions cannot be made. In addition, provinces make
independent decisions on which drugs to place on formulary based on individual criteria and guidelines.
In Canada, HC approval and subsequent placement
of a drug on a provincial formulary renders the drug accessible to Canadians without payment for cancer drug cost,
drug administration, or physician visits by virtue of a universally funded health care system. Out-of-pocket medical
expenses for a Canadian patient would include supportive
medications, such as antiemetics, and many Canadians
have private health insurance that will pay a majority of
these costs. Although drugs are available in the United
States after FDA approval, the financial toxicity of cancer
care can influence access to treatment. Out-of-pocket
expenses for US patients vary greatly because of
Cancer

May 15, 2015

Comparison of Drug Approval: HC & FDA/Ezeife et al

differences in health insurance coverage, deductibles, and
copayments. Future research should investigate the
impact of these different barriers on patient outcomes.
In summary, we observed that the drug submission
to drug approval process was approximately 3 months
longer in Canada than in the United States. After HC approval, the time to placement on the Alberta provincial
drug formulary was approximately 16.7 months, similar
to the other 4 provinces studied. To our knowledge, this is
the first detailed documentation of the Canadian approval
timeline for oncology drugs. Assessment of initiatives to
decrease the time to placement on Canadian provincial
formularies should be evaluated. Future research should
also investigate ways of closing the timeline gap between
FDA and HC approval. Reducing the time to drug approval and equalizing access to oncology drugs ultimately
will improve patient access to new therapies.
