ABSTRACT
Altered cellular metabolism is now generally acknowledged as a hallmark of cancer
cells, the resultant abnormal oncometabolites cause both metabolic and nonmetabolic
dysregulation and potential transformation to malignancy. A subset of cancers have been
found to be associated with mutations in succinate dehydrogenase genes which result
in the accumulation of succinate. However, the function of succinate in tumorigenesis
remains unclear. In the present study, we aim to investigate the role of oncometabolite
succinate in tumor angiogenesis. Our data demonstrated the accumulation of markedly
elevated succinate in gastric cancer tissues compared with that in paracancerous
tissues. Moreover, succinate was able to increase the chemotactic motility, tube-like
structure formation and proliferation of primary human umbilical vascular endothelial
cells (pHUVECs) in vitro, as well as promoting the blood vessel formation in transgenic
zebrafish. Our mechanistic studies reveal that succinate upregulates vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) expression by activation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 via its receptor
GPR91 in a HIF-1α independent mechanism. Taken together, these data indicate an
important role of the succinate-GPR91 axis in tumor angiogenesis, which may enable
development of a novel therapeutic strategy that targets cancer metabolism.

switch during tumorigenesis is almost always activated
and remains on, causing quiescent vasculature to sprout
new vessels that help sustain expanding neoplastic
growths continually [4]. Angiogenesis is a complicated
multistep process which contains steps of the migration,
proliferation, tube formation, invasion and finally capillary
network formation of vascular endothelial cells [5], and
is tightly regulated directly or indirectly by the dynamic
balance between angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors.
As one of metabolic products in the tumor
environment, lactate has been proved to promote cancer
angiogenesis [6]. Another oncometabolite succinate was also
found to accumulate in certain cancers which mainly caused
by mutation of succinate dehydrogenase gene. However, its

INTRODUCTION
Dysregulated metabolism is generally accepted
as a characteristic hallmark of cancer cells [1] which
exhibit altered metabolic phenotype when compared
with nonmalignant cells [2]. Mutations in the metabolic
genes like fumarate hydratase, succinate dehydrogenase,
and isocitrate dehydrogenase lead to the accumulation of
fumarate, succinate, and D–2-hydroxyglutarate, respectively
[3], which cause both metabolic and nonmetabolic
dysregulation and potential transformation to malignancy.
Angiogenesis is another biological hallmark of
cancer [1]. The normal vasculature becomes quiescent
following the morphogenesis. In contrast, the angiogenic

role in tumorigenesis remains unclear. As an intermediate
of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, succinate is essential for
adenosine triphosphate generation in mitochondria and also
a crucial metabolite in several metabolic pathways. It is
normally present in the circulation of blood at about 5μM
concentration [7, 8], while under pathological conditions it
is accumulated in extra-cellular spaces. High succinate levels
(from 150μM to millimole) have been detected in the urine
and plasma or the cerebral white matter of patients with
metabolic diseases [9, 10]. Besides as energy metabolism,
recent studies have demonstrated the new role of succinate
as a cellular signaling molecule. For example, succinate
accumulates in succinate dehydrogenase-deficient tumors
like gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), inhibits prolyl
hydroxylase activity with subsequent HIF-1α stabilization
and therefore drives cancer progression [11, 12]. Succinate
also enhances interleukin-1β and VEGF production in a
HIF-1α-depend pathway [9]. These significant findings
indicate that succinate is capable of acting as an intracellular
messenger which induces the alterations of gene expression
in tumors by targeting HIF-1α. Meanwhile, succinate was
demonstrated as an extracellular circulating signaling
molecule in a para- and endocrine mode mediated by its
specific plasmalemmal succinate receptor [13], which
probably beyond HIF-1α stabilization.
G protein-coupled receptor-91 (GPR91), also known as
succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1) [10], is expressed in several
highly vascularized tissues, including retina, heart, liver,
kidney and white adipose tissue, and even on the surface of
human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. GPR91 activation
triggered by local extracellular succinate inhibits lipolysis in
white adipose tissue, governs retinal angiogenesis, increases
the release of renin in glomerular endothelium, enhances the

secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by dendritic cells for
activation of T helper cells, and also serves as a signaling
regulator of hepatic fibrosis [13–20].
The comprehensive roles of succinate and its specific
receptor in the development of tumor angiogenesis have
not been investigated extensively. In the present study,
we examined succinate levels in human gastric cancer
tissues and demonstrated that succinate functioned as a
biologically active molecule through its receptor GPR91,
which bridges a gap between tumor-altered metabolism
and angiogenesis.

RESULTS
Comparison of succinate levels in gastric cancer
tissues/paracancerous tissues, cell culture
supernatants from normal cells and gastric
cancer cells
Succinate levels were measured in 12 pairs of human
gastric adenocarcinoma and tumor-adjacent tissues, which
were obtained from stage II-IV male patients with low/
moderate-differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma over 45
years of age. As shown in Figure 1A, the levels of succinate
in gastric cancer tissues were significantly higher than
that in adjacent normal tissues. To detect the extracellular
succinate levels of different cell lines, the cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 media (no phenol red) supplemented with
0.5% FBS for 24h and the supernatants were collected for
measurement. Markedly elevated succinate levels in human
gastric cancer cells (NCI-N87, BGC-823, AGS and SGC7901) culture were observed compared to human normal
gastric epithelial cell (GES-1) culture (Figure 1B). These

increased the viability of primary pHUVEC when
compared to control (Figure 2A). Since the migration
of endothelial cells is a crucial step in angiogenesis
and cancer progression [21], the effects of succinate on
chemotactic motility of pHUVECs were evaluated by
transwell and wound-healing migration assays. As shown
in Figure 2B and 2C, succinate significantly increased
pHUVEC migratory straight distance when compared to
PBS control in a concentration-dependent manner. Since
the differentiation of endothelial cells and the formation
of tube-like structures are essential for angiogenesis, the

96-well plates coated with growth factor reduced matrigel. Six hours later, tubular structures were photographed (Magnification, ×100). Three
independent experiments (A, B, C and D) data are presented as mean ±SD. *p<0.05 and **p<0.01 versus PBS control.

ability of succinate to promote tube formation was further
investigated in a three-dimensional model of endothelial
cell capillary tube formation in Matrigel. Stimulation with
10 ng/mL VEGF promoted pHUVECs differentiating and
forming robust tubular-like structures (data not shown).
Similarly, succinate enhanced the formation of a tube-like
network as well after 6 h of culture as shown in Figure
2D. Quantitative measurements confirmed that succinate

angiogenesis [22]. As shown in Figure 3A, treatment
with 0.2 μg/mL PTK787 prevented the formation of
blood vessels. As anticipated, the simultaneous treatment
of VEGF165 significantly restored angiogenesis. In line
with the observations described above, the length of
SIVs was significantly increased in zebrafish embryos
treated with succinate at the concentration above 100μM
when compared to PBS control, which indicates a proangiogenic effect of succinate on zebrafish embryo in a
dose-dependent manner.

Succinate activates STAT3 and ERK signaling
through GPR91

To study the effect of succinate on angiogenesis in
vivo, transgenic (flk1: GFP) zebrafish embryos, which
express GFP in all vascular endothelial cells, were used.
The development of zebrafish SIVs was visualized
using fluorescence stereomicroscope. SIVs length was
measured with Image Pro Plus. The representative photos
and quantitative analysis of zebrafish SIVs were shown
in Figure 3. The small molecule kinase inhibitor PTK787
was used in pro-angiogenesis in vivo model, which
inhibits human VEGFRs and therefore effectively blocks

In order to investigate the pro-angiogenic
mechanism of succinate, we first determined the timing
and dosage of succinate treatment on STAT3 and ERK
activation. pHUVECs were cultured in the presence of
400 μM succinate and measured ERK1/2 and STAT3
expression at different time point (5, 15, 30 and 60 min).
As shown in Figure 4A, the peak of pERK1/2 expression
level is at 15 min, while the peak of pSTAT3 expression is
at 30 min. The data suggest ERK activation by succinate

800 μM) or 10 ng/mL of VEGF165 were added to the culture for twenty-four hours. Representative photographs are listed to show the

is earlier than STAT3. A dose-dependent trend of the
activation was further observed when pHUVECs were
treated with various concentrations of succinate (Figure
4B). To verify that succinate activated ERK1/2 and STAT3
signaling through the receptor GPR91, we knocked down
its expression with two kinds of lentiviruses containing
the different shRNA sequences (LV. shGPR91-1 and 2),
which were also adopted to exclude the off-target effect.
Both LV. shGPR91 (transfection rate of ~95%) diminished
GPR91 mRNA approximately 85-90% and the protein
expression about 65%, whereas LV.shScrambled (control)
was ineffective to reduce GPR91 expression (Figure 4C).
Using this knockdown technique, we observed that the
increase in the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and
STAT3 was significantly blocked by both LV. shGPR91
(P<0.01) as shown in Figure 4C. These results indicate

that GPR91 mediates the activation of ERK1/2 and STAT3
signaling by succinate.

Succinate promotes angiogenesis by activating
ERK1/2 signaling via GPR91 in pHUVECs
A series of assays including BrdU incorporation,
wound-healing migration, transwell and capillarylike formation were applied to evaluate the proangiogenic effect of succinate. pHUVECs transduced
with LV.shGPR91 or LV.shScrambled were pre-treated
with 10μM ERK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib to assess the
activation of succinate on ERK1/2 through GPR91.
As shown in Figure 5A–5D, treatment with 400μM of
succinate significantly increased the viability, chemotactic
motility and capillary structure formation ability of

decrease VEGF expression induced by succinate, and the
combinations further reduced to the control level (Figure
6B and 6C). Then, we investigated the role of GPR91 in
the regulation of VEGF secretion by succinate. GPR91
knockdown reduced VEGF mRNA by approximately 55%
(Figure 6B) and significantly decreased VEGF protein
expression by approximately 34% (Figure 6C). These data
indicated that effect of succinate on VEGF upregulation
was through modulating STAT3 and ERK1/2 signaling via
GPR91 in pHUVECs.

VEGF upregulation induced by succinate
depends on the activation of STAT3 and ERK1/2
signaling in pHUVECs

DISCUSSION

Next, we sought to investigate the mechanism
of pro-angiogenic function of succinate on pHUVECs.
VEGF is a well-known angiogenic mediator that can
promote endothelial cells growth. As shown in Figure 6A,
6B and 6C, succinate treatment significantly increased
VEGF mRNA and protein levels in pHUVECs compared
with PBS control group. Since VEGF is the target gene
of HIF-1α transcription factor, we knocked down HIF-1α
gene and determined whether HIF-1α played a functional
role in the effect of succinate. Interestingly, depletion of
HIF-1α didn’t affect the upregulation of VEGF induced by
succinate as shown in Figure 6A. Instead, ERK inhibitor
Selumetinib or STAT3 inhibitor Stattic alone was able to

Altered cellular metabolism is now known as a
hallmark of cancer cells. The involved metabolic pathways
include aerobic glycolysis, glutamine catabolism,
anaplerosis, de novo synthesis of fatty acids and lipids
[23]. The resultant abnormally accumulated metabolites
cause both metabolic and nonmetabolic dysregulation
and potential transformation to malignancy, and herein
termed oncometabolites including fumarate, succinate,
and D-2-hydroxyglutarate [24]. An increasing body of
evidence suggests that the abnormal accumulation of these
metabolites can re-edit tumor microenvironment, therefore
drive cancer progression.

Succinate, a crucial intermediate metabolite
in several metabolic pathways, is accumulated in
extracellular spaces under pathological condition, for
instance, hyperglycemic or hypoxia. High concentrations
of succinate (from 150μM to millimole) have been
detected in the urine and plasma or the cerebral
white matter of patients with metabolic diseases [9,
10]. Dysfunction of the succinate dehydrogenase, a
heterotetrameric enzyme complex participating in both
the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, leads to
succinate accumulation in human tumors such as papillary
thyroid cancers, thyroid C-cells hyperplasia, pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors, paragangliomas, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, renal carcinomas and pituitary
adenomas [7, 25]. However, there is no evidence to show
whether oncometabolite succinate elevation is present in
gastric cancer. Using tissue samples from patients with
stage II-IV gastric cancer we demonstrated that succinate
levels were increased in human gastric adenocarcinoma
compared with tumor-adjacent tissues (Figure 1A). In
addition, our data reveal that human gastric cancer cells
(NCI-N87, BGC-823, AGS and SGC-7901) produce more
succinate than normal epithelial GES-1 cells (Figure 1B).
Angiogenesis inducing is another hallmark of cancer
[1, 4]. It has been shown that succinate accumulates in the
hypoxic retina of rodents as a potent mediator of vessel
growth in the settings of both normal retinal development
and proliferative ischemic retinopathy [15]. Therefore, we
focus on investigating the function of succinate in tumor
angiogenesis. Herein, we examined pro-angiogenic effects
of succinate in vitro and in vivo. As shown in Figure 2
and 3, succinate was able to increase chemotactic motility,
tube-like structure formation and proliferation of primary
human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (pHUVECs),
as well as promoting blood vessel formation in transgenic
zebrafish.
The well-known prototype of angiogenesis inducers
is VEGF, which is a well-documented angiogenic mediator
that can promote endothelial cells growth, maturation
and survival [26]. In the present study, we demonstrate
that succinate mediates HIF-independent upregulation of
VEGF and promote tumor angiogenesis via plasmalemmal
GPR91 at pH 7.4. Succinate has been identified as an
inhibitor of prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) in vitro to
upregulate HIF-1α expression, which has Ki values of 350460 μM [11]. It doesn’t penetrate cell membrane easily and
has limited uptake into cells, especially in PH7.4 [27, 28].
Therefore, we administered certain amount of succinate
which didn’t induce HIF-1α stabilization. Interestingly,
VEGF expression induced by succinate is through
GPR91 receptor in HIF-1α-independent manner (Figure
6A). It is noteworthy that the effective concentration of
succinate for a half-maximal (EC50) response on GPR91
is 28-56 μM [10], higher than the 10μM succinate used
in aortic rings assay which resulted in minimal sprouting
[15], indicating that GPR91 would be activated at higher
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

concentrations of succinate in pHUVECs. We find that
200μM succinate already can stimulate VEGF production
and promote tumor angiogenesis beyond HIF-1α.
MEK-ERK signaling pathway plays a central
role in tumor angiogenesis [29]. Its activation promotes
sprouting and increases vessel length in tumors [30].
Succinate has been shown to activate ERK1/2 through Gq
and Gi [31]. In the present study, we demonstrated that
succinate promoted angiogenesis by ERK1/2 signaling
via GPR91 in pHUVECs. Interestingly, succinate also
activated STAT3 tyrosine705 phosphorylation (Figure 3).
STAT3 is known as a direct transcriptional activator of
VEGF gene by its phosphorylation at tyrosine705, which
is essential for its dimer formation, nuclear translocation,
and DNA binding activity [32]. Transactivation of the
STAT3 C-terminal domain depends on its tyrosine705 and
serine 727. ERK1/2 specifically phosphorylates STAT3 at
serine 727, which negatively modulates STAT3 tyrosine
phosphorylation [33]. We presume that ERK1/2 activation
would reduce STAT3 tyrosine705 phosphorylation at
a later time in pHUVECs since the phosphorylation
of STAT3 tyrosine705 was not be detected at 24h after
succinate stimulation, instead ERK1/2 signaling activity
was still upregulated (data not shown). These data suggest
that STAT3 activation participates in the early stage of
succinate induced pro-angiogenesis, whereas sustained
activation of ERK1/2 via GPR91 mainly accounts
for the angiogenic function of succinate in the tumor
microenvironment.
Angiogenesis is required for invasive tumor growth
and metastasis, and plays an essential role in the control
of cancer progression. Our data demonstrate the proangiogenic role of oncometabolite succinate, which can
upregulate VEGF expression by activating ERK1/2 and
STAT3 signaling via GPR91 receptor. These findings have
potential clinical implications that targeting succinateGPR91 axis may be applied as a novel therapeutic strategy
to inhibit tumor angiogenesis.

Succinate level measurement
Succinate level was determined by Succinate
Colorimetric Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St Louis,
MO, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, tissues (50 mg) were rapidly homogenized
on ice in 500 μL of ice-cold Succinate Assay Buffer
and centrifuged at 10,000×g for 5 minutes to remove
insoluble material. For cell cultures, the supernatants of
cells (1×106 cells) were collected and diluted 1:1 with
0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Then, the samples were added
into a 96-well plate in duplicate wells and mixed with the
appropriate Reaction Mix. The resultant mixtures were
further incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. The succinate
concentration was determined by the standard curve
using spectroscopy at 450 nm wavelength, and each
measurement was performed in triplicate.

Cell lines and cell culture
Primary human umbilical vascular endothelial
cells (pHUVECs) were isolated from human umbilical
cord veins by collagenase (Sigma) digestion as described
previously [34]. Briefly, pHUVECs were maintained
in endothelial cell medium at 37°C under a humidified
95%:5% (v/v) mixture of air and CO2. Ten μM of
Selumetinib or Stattic was applied to inhibit ERK1/2 or
STAT3 activation.

(BrdU) incorporation
Cell proliferation was evaluated by a BrdU assay kit
(Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, pHUVECs
(5×103 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates overnight.
Then, the cells were starved in serum-free ECM for
6 h and further cultured in 100 μL of serum-free ECM
containing various concentrations of succinate for 24 h.
Ten μL of a BrdU-labeling solution was added to each well
for 4 h and the wells were dried, fixed, and measured the
optical density at a wavelength of 450 nm. These assays
were repeated in triplicate.

Wound-healing migration assay
pHUVECs were seeded into 6-well plates pre-coated
with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) to grow to full confluence
and subsequently starved in serum-free ECM for 6 h to
synchronization. The cells were wounded with pipette
tips and cultured in serum-free ECM with or without
various concentrations of succinate. Images were captured
(Olympus; magnification, ×100) after 12 h of incubation at
37°C in a 95%:5% (v/v) mixture of air and CO2.

Lentiviruses and endothelial cells infection
Lentiviruses carrying shRNA sequence targeting
human GPR91 or human HIF-1α were obtained from
GeneChem (Shanghai, China). The viruses were used to
infect cells in the presence of Polybrene. Forty-eight hours

primers are 5′-AGGGCAGAATCATCACGAAGT- 3′ and
5′-AGGGTCTCGATTGGATGGCA-3′. Human GAPDH
gene primers are 5′- TTGCCATCAATGACCCCTTCA- 3′
and 5′- CGCCCCACTTGATTTTGGA- 3′.

Capillary-like tube formation assay
Tube formation was assessed as previously
described [34]. Growth factor-reduced Matrigel was
pipetted into pre-chilled 96-well plates (60 μL per well)
and polymerized for 1 hour at 37°C. pHUVECs (2.0×104
cells/well) were first incubated in serum-free ECM for
6 h, subsequently seeded onto the Matrigel layer in the
presence of various concentrations of succinate for 6h in
96-well plates. The tubular structures of the endothelial
cells were recorded using an inverted microscope
(Olympus; magnification, ×100). The number of meshes
per field was calculated randomly from five fields.

Western immunoblot analysis
To study the molecular mechanism of succinateinducing angiogenesis, pHUVECs were first starved
in serum-free ECM for 6 h and then treated with or
without various concentration of succinate for 15 min
(for GPR91 activation) or 400μM succinate at different
timepoints. After stimulation, the cells were harvested
and lysed followed by centrifugation. The total protein
concentration was determined by Bicinchoninic acid
assay. An equal amount of protein from each lysate
(30-40μg) was electrophoresed on 8-12% SDS
polyacrylamide gels and probed with specific primary
antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody.

Zebrafish embryos angiogenesis assay
Transgenic (flk1: GFP) zebrafish embryos were
generated by natural pair-wise mating, collected and
maintained in 28.5°C incubator as previously described
[35]. Healthy, limpid, and fluorescent embryos were
picked out at 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf) and
distributed into a 24-well microplate (9 embryos/well)
containing Holt Buffer. A final concentration of 0.2 μg/
mL PTK787 (VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Sigma)
was added to each well at 24 hours post-fertilization
(hpf) and washed out at 30 hpf. Meanwhile, various
concentration of succinate (100, 200, 400 and 800μM) or
10 ng/mL of VEGF165 were added to the culture media.
PBS served as the control. Embryos were maintained
in a 28.5°C incubator for an additional 24h, placed
onto a glass slide, and photographed using fluorescence
stereomicroscope. The overall length of the subintestinal
vessels (SIVs) were quantified using Image J software.
Pro-angiogenic effects were defined as the increase of
SIVs length. The experimental protocol was established
according to institutional ethical guidelines for animal
experiments and approved by the Ethics Committee
of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical
University.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The cell culture supernatant was collected from nontransduced, LV.shScrambled-transduced or LV.shGPR91transduced cells treated with different concentration of
succinate. Then, VEGF level was measured by VEGF
enzyme-linked immunoassay kits (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Each sample was tested in triplicate.

Statistical analysis
All data reported herein represent means ±
SD from at least three independent experiments.
Statistical comparisons between the treated groups
and the control group were performed by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnet’s
test, the difference between two groups was analyzed
by Student’s t-test. A P value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
