Abstract
Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) causes G1 arrest and increases
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21/Cip1 and p27/Kip1
protein levels in human prostate cancer (PCa) DU145 cells
lacking functional p53. However, whether cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor I induction by IP6 plays any role in its
antitumor efficacy is unknown. Herein, we observed that
either p21 or p27 knockdown by small interfering RNA has no
considerable effect on IP6-induced G1 arrest, growth inhibition, and death in DU145 cells; however, the simultaneous
knockdown of both p21 and p27 reversed the effects of IP6.
To further confirm these findings both in vitro and in vivo, we
generated DU145 cell variants with knockdown levels of p21
(DU-p21), p27 (DU-p27), or both (DU-p21+p27) via retroviral
transduction of respective short hairpin RNAs. Knocking down
p21 or p27 individually did not alter IP6-caused cell growth
inhibition and G1 arrest; however, their simultaneous ablation
completely reversed the effects of IP6. In tumor xenograft
studies, IP6 (2% w/v, in drinking water) caused a comparable
reduction in tumor volume (40–46%) and tumor cell proliferation (26–28%) in DU-EV (control), DU-p21, and DU-p27
tumors but lost most of its effect in DU-p21+p27 tumors.
IP6-caused apoptosis also occurred in a Cip/Kip-dependent
manner because DU-p21+p27 cells were completely resistant
to IP6-induced apoptosis both in cell culture and xenograft.
Together, these results provide evidence, for the first time, of
the critical role of p21 and p27 in mediating the anticancer
efficacy of IP6, and suggest their redundant role in the
antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of IP6 in p53lacking human PCa cells, both in vitro and in vivo. [Cancer

Introduction
Prostate cancer (PCa) accounts for f25% (186,320) of cancer
incidence and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths
in the male population in the United States (1). The disease is
initially responsive to androgen ablation therapy, but it eventually
progresses to the androgen-independent form which is relatively
more invasive and metastatic (2). Usually, PCa is a disease of elderly
males and the time elapsed between the onset of preneoplastic
lesions and detectable malignancy often ranges in decades, thus

allowing for a sufficiently large time window for preventive
intervention. However, the use of synthetic agents in long-term
chemopreventive strategies is intrinsically associated with safety
and toxicity problems (3, 4). This has led to the increasing
enthusiasm in diet-related cancer chemoprevention strategies,
which are also supported by epidemiologic and case-control
studies indicating an important role of dietary agents in the
etiology as well as the prevention of cancer (5–7). Low-fat and highfiber (especially soluble fibers present in oat bran, legumes, etc.)
diets have been suggested to protect against various forms of
cancers including PCa (8).
Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) is a polyphosphorylated carbohydrate present in abundant amounts in high-fiber–containing food
sources such as legumes, nuts, cereals, etc. IP6 and its lower
phosphate forms (IP1–IP5) are also present in mammalian cells, in
which they govern various cellular functions, including signal
transduction, growth, and differentiation (9). IP6 is available as a
dietary supplement and has long been known for its beneficial
effects, including strengthening the immune system, preventing
kidney stone formation and lowering serum cholesterol levels
(9–11). Shamsuddin and coworkers first established the cancerpreventive efficacy of IP6 in carcinogen-induced colon cancer
models (12), following which there has been an increasing interest
in investigating the antineoplastic potential of this phytonutrient.
IP6 has shown significant promise against a broad spectrum of
cancer models including prostate, colon, pancreas, liver, and breast
(13–18). Moreover, in breast cancer models, when used in a
combination regimen with Adriamycin or tamoxifen, IP6 increases
the activity of these conventional chemotherapeutic agents and
helps to overcome drug resistance (19). Over the past few years, our
laboratory has focused on establishing the chemopreventive efficacy
of IP6 in cell culture and animal models of PCa. Initial studies
showed that IP6 induces prominent G1 arrest as well as apoptosis in
both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PCa cell lines
(20, 21). In tumor xenografts of DU145 cells, IP6 significantly
reduced tumor volume, tumor weight, cell proliferation and
angiogenesis, and induced apoptosis (22). Furthermore, in the
transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate model, which is a
reliable murine model for studying the multistage events of prostate
carcinogenesis, IP6 treatment showed a significant reduction in
tumor grade and cell proliferation, and an induction of apoptosis
in prostate tumor tissues (23). There is no report, thus far, of any
considerable toxicity of IP6 in animal studies (16, 17, 22, 23). The
promising anticancer efficacy, along with the lack of toxicity
associated with IP6 administration in preclinical models, underscores the chemopreventive potential of IP6 as well as warranting
further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action.
Threshold kinase activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) is
a crucial determinant of the cell cycle progression, and thus, the

IP6 Inhibits PCa Growth by Up-regulating p21 and p27

agents which inhibit CDK activity directly or indirectly, by upregulating CDK inhibitor (CDKI) expression, represent a rational
approach to intervene with the uncontrolled proliferation of
carcinoma cells (24). Moreover, prolonged cell cycle arrest resulting
in apoptosis is also an effective strategy in reducing the burden of
cancer cells. The key features of IP6 efficacy, as established in
various PCa cell lines, are cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and
concurrent Cip/Kip protein induction (20, 21). In order to address
the question of whether the biological effects of IP6 are mediated in
a Cip/Kip-dependent manner, we generated DU145 cells with stable
knockdown levels of p21 and/or p27 proteins and examined the
effect of IP6 on these cell variants for cell proliferation, growth
arrest, apoptosis, and tumorigenicity. Our studies reveal that
induction of p21 and p27 protein expression is an essential event
for mediating the antitumor, antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects
of IP6.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and small interfering RNA transfection. p27 small
interfering RNA (siRNA; sequence not revealed by vendor) was from
Upstate, p21-siRNA (sequence not revealed by vendor) was from Cell
Signaling Technology, nonspecific (control)-siRNA was from Dharmacon,
and Trans-IT TKO transfection reagent was from Mirus. DU145 cells

(American Type Culture Collection) were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10%
serum, and at f30% confluency, transfected with nonspecific, p21, and/or
p27 siRNA (each 50 nmol/L, final concentration) in 10% serum condition for
24 h following Mirus’s protocol with some modifications. The next day, cells
were fed with fresh medium with or without 2 mmol/L of IP6 for 24 h, and
harvested for cell cycle analysis or Western immunoblotting. The selection
of 2 mmol/L of IP6 concentration for all the cell culture studies was based
on our recent publications showing optimum effects at this level (17, 20, 21).
DU145 cell variants with empty vector (DU-EV) and knockdown levels of
p21 (DU-p21), p27 (DU-p27), or both (DU-p21+p27) were generated via
retroviral transduction of respective short hairpin RNAs as reported
recently (25).
Cell growth and clonogenic assay. For growth curves, 1  105 DU145
cell variants were plated in 60 mm dishes, treated with 2 mmol/L of IP6 for
48 h, and then the number of cells and percentage of dead cells were
analyzed by trypan blue exclusion method as reported recently (20, 21). To
assess the clonogenic potential of these different DU145 cell line variants
and IP6 activity, cells were seeded at a density of 1,000 cells/well in six-well
plates and next day were treated with 2 mmol/L of IP6. After 10 days, cells
were fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) for 10 min and then stained with
0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. The plates were washed thrice with PBS and
the colonies (>50 cells/colony) were counted under Zeiss Invertoskop 40C
(Carl Zeiss, Inc.).
Flow cytometry analysis for cell cycle distribution. Following the
desired treatments, cells were harvested and quickly washed twice with icecold PBS, and cell pellets were collected. Approximately 0.5  106 cells in

0.5 mL of saponin/propidium iodide (PI) solution (0.3% saponin, w/v;
25 Ag/mL PI, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA; and 10 Ag/mL RNase A) were incubated at
4jC for 24 h in the dark as reported earlier (26). Cell cycle distribution was
then analyzed by flow cytometry using the FACS Analysis Core Services of
the University of Colorado Cancer Center. The quantitative data presented
are mean F SE of the percentage cell population in different phases of cell
cycle from triplicate samples in each treatment, and were reproducible in
two independent experiments.
Western immunoblotting. Total lysates, from cells in culture and
tumors in xenograft studies, were prepared in nondenaturing lysis buffer as
reported previously, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-glycine gel
(26). The separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane
followed by blocking with 5% nonfat milk powder (w/v) in TBS [10 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20] for 1 h at room
temperature. Membranes were probed with antibodies for p21 and p27
(Millipore), and cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by
peroxidase-conjugated appropriate secondary antibody and visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare Bioscience).
In each case, blots were subjected to multiple exposures on the film to make
sure that the band density is in the linear range. The blots were scanned

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (3). February 1, 2009

with Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems), and the mean density of each
band was analyzed by the Scion Image program (NIH, Bethesda, MD). As
needed, the densitometric values are given below each band. To ensure
equal protein loading, each membrane was stripped and reprobed with
anti–h-actin antibody (Sigma).
In vivo tumor xenograft study. Cells were detached from the culture
dishes by trypsinization and then collected, washed, and resuspended in
serum-free and antibiotic-free RPMI 1640. To establish DU145 cell variants,
tumor xenografts in mice, 6-week-old athymic nu/nu male mice were
injected s.c. with 3  106 cells mixed with Matrigel (1:1; Collaborative
Biomedical Products) in the right flank of each mouse. The animals of each
cell type were then divided into two groups (n = 14 mice per group) and
from day 6 were fed with regular drinking water or with 2% IP6 (w/v) in
drinking water. The tumor sizes were measured twice weekly with a digital
caliper, and tumor volume was calculated by the formula ‘‘0.5236 L 1 (L 2)2,
where L 1 is the long axis and L 2 is the short axis of the tumor’’ as reported
previously (27). At the end of the experiment, tumors were excised, weighed,
and stored at 80jC until additional analysis.
Immunohistochemistry. Part of tumor samples were fixed in 10%
buffered formalin for 12 h and processed conventionally. For proliferating

(Sigma). Apoptotic cells were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediating dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining using
Dead End Colorimetric TUNEL System (Promega) according to the

were counted in five arbitrarily selected fields at 400 magnification and
data are represented as the number of positive (brown) cells  100 / total
number of cells (28).
Statistical and immunohistochemical analyses. Statistical significance of difference between the control and treated group of each cell type
as well as between different cell types was determined by one-way ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni t test using SigmaStat 2.03 software (Jandel
Scientific). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Microscopic
immunohistochemical analysis was done by Zeiss Axioscop 2 microscope
(Carl Zeiss Inc.) and photomicrographs were captured by Carl Zeiss

Results
IP6-induced G1 arrest is mediated via p21 and p27 induction
in DU145 cells. Consistent with our earlier studies, IP6 increased
the expression levels of both p21 and p27 proteins which were
associated with G1 arrest mostly at the expense of S phase cell
population in DU145 cells (Fig. 1A and B). In the studies determining the role of these CDKIs in IP6-induced G1 arrest, knocking
down either p21 or p27 by siRNA (Fig. 1A) did not reverse the IP6induced G1 arrest (Fig. 1A), but rather seemed to sensitize the cells
to slightly increased G1 arrest following IP6 treatment (Fig. 1A). In
p27 knockdown condition, a slight increase in p21 protein level
was also observed, which became more prominent following IP6
treatment (Fig. 1B). When we used both p21 and p27 siRNAs
together to create a double knockdown condition, we did not
observe any change in cell cycle phase distribution (versus control)
even though protein expression of both the molecules was ablated
(Fig. 1A and B). In addition, knocking down of both these CDKIs
also completely reversed IP6-induced G1 arrest in DU145 cells
(Fig. 1A). Cells transfected with nonspecific control siRNA did not
show any considerable effect on cell cycle distribution (Fig. 1A) or
the protein expression of these CDKIs (Fig. 1B). These results
suggest that either of the functional Cip and Kip genes is sufficient
to mediate IP6-induced G1 arrest in the advanced stage of PCa in
which both p53 and Rb are mutated. Together, these findings also
suggested that CDKIs p21 and p27 are the critical targets of IP6
efficacy in controlling deregulated cell cycle progression via G1
arrest in PCa cells. Several additional studies were next performed
to support this suggestion under both in vitro and in vivo
conditions using stable p21 and/or p27 knockdown DU145 cells.
Down-regulation of p21 and p27 protein levels attenuates
the growth arrest efficacy of IP6 via abrogation of the G1
checkpoint. Because studies with p21 and p27 siRNAs provided
convincing evidence of the indispensable role of Cip/Kip proteins
in IP6-induced G1 arrest, we used cell lines with stable knockdown
levels of p21 (DU-p21) or p27 (DU-p27) or both (DU-p21+p27)
proteins, via retroviral transduction of their corresponding short
hairpin RNAs, to elucidate the precise role(s) of these molecules in
the anticancer efficacy of IP6 (25). First, we examined the effect of
IP6 treatment on the growth characteristics of these different cell
variants. After 48 h of treatment with a 2 mmol/L dose of IP6, there
were 33% (P < 0.001), 52% (P < 0.001), and 35% (P < 0.001)
reduction in total cell number in DU-EV, DU-p21, and DU-p27 cells,
respectively; whereas in DU-p21+p27 cells, there was only a 10%
(nonsignificant) reduction in cell number compared with controls
(Fig. 2A). The clonogenic potential of these cell variants was also
affected differently with IP6 treatment. The clonogenicity of the
untreated DU-EV, DU-p21, and DU-p27 cells were comparable, and
with IP6, their colony-forming capacity was reduced by 31%, 30%,
and 27%, respectively (Fig. 2B). However, the clonogenic potential
of DU-p21+p27 cells was higher (41%) than the untreated DU-EV
cells, and with IP6 treatment, it was reduced by only 6%
(nonsignificant versus control; Fig. 2B).
The effect of IP6 on the cell cycle progression pattern of different
DU145 cell variants was also analyzed. Consistent with the results
obtained in DU145 cells, transiently transfected with p21 and/or
p27 siRNAs, IP6 induced significant G1 arrest in DU-EV cells (58%
G1 population in control versus 68% in IP6-treated group; P <
0.001) as well as in DU-p21 (54% in control versus 65% in IP6 group;
P < 0.001) and DU-p27 cells (53% in control versus 69% in IP6
group; P < 0.001; Fig. 2C). However, in case of DU-p21+p27 cells,

Figure 4. IP6 fails to inhibit tumor xenograft growth of DU145 cells with knocked down levels of both p21 and p27. Different DU145 cell variants were implanted
in athymic nude mice as detailed in Materials and Methods. After 6 days of inoculation, animals were fed with or without IP6 (2% w/v) in drinking water. A, the
tumor volume was measured as a function of days of treatment throughout the study. B, at the end of 59 days of treatment, the animals were euthanized and tumor
tissues were excised and weighed. C, the relative protein levels of p21 and p27 with or without IP6 treatment were analyzed in all the DU145 tumor types by
Western blotting. C, control; #, P < 0.05; *, P < 0.001; NS, not statistically significant.

the IP6-caused G1 arrest was almost completely reversed because
the G1 population increased from 51% in control to only 54% with
IP6 treatment (Fig. 2C). Western immunoblotting for Cip/Kip
proteins in these treatment groups showed that IP6 increases both
p21 and p27 levels in DU-EV cells, only p27 levels in DU-p21 cells
and only p21 levels in DU-p27 cells, but neither of them in DUp21+p27 cells (Fig. 2C, inset). Together, these findings convincingly
support the notion that ablation of p21 or p27 protein levels affects
the growth-inhibitory potential of IP6 to different degrees;
nevertheless, they play complimentary roles for cell cycle arrest

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (3). February 1, 2009

and cell growth inhibition, and their simultaneous ablation is
essential to reverse the antiproliferative efficacy of IP6.
Essential role of p21 and p27 in apoptotic response of IP6 in
DU145 cells. Our previous studies have shown that IP6 induces
moderate to high levels of apoptotic death in DU145 cells with 1 to
4 mmol/L doses (20). Accordingly, here we also assessed whether
IP6-caused induction of p21 and p27 plays any role in its cell death
response. As shown in Fig. 3A, the percentage of dead cells,
assessed by trypan blue staining, increased with IP6 treatment by
2-fold in DU-EV, 2.8-fold in DU-p21, and 2.2-fold in DU-p27 cells,

IP6 Inhibits PCa Growth by Up-regulating p21 and p27

but by only 1.1-fold in DU-p21+p27 cells, over their respective
controls. These observations, therefore, prompted us to delineate
the role of p21 and p27 in IP6-induced apoptosis. We used Annexin
V/PI staining to quantify apoptotic cells in DU145 cell variants with
or without IP6 treatment. We observed that IP6 increases the
apoptotic population by 2-fold (P < 0.001) in DU-EV, 2.2-fold (P <
0.001) in DU-p21, and 3-fold (P < 0.001) in DU-p27 cells; however,
the apoptotic effect of IP6 was almost completely lost in DUp21+p27 cells (Fig. 3B). To further verify the relative apoptotic
index, we analyzed the levels of cleaved PARP by immunoblot
analysis and observed that IP6 increases cleaved PARP levels by
2-fold in DU-EV, DU-p21, and DU-p27 cells but failed to induce any
significant PARP cleavage in DU-p21+p27 cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, the
ablation of either of the CDKIs retains the sensitivity of DU145 cells
to IP6-induced apoptosis, however, their simultaneous ablation
makes the cells almost completely resistant to apoptosis.
IP6 fails to inhibit DU145 tumor xenograft growth in p21
and p27 simultaneous knockdown condition. All the in vitro
studies point to the important role of p21 and p27 in inducing
IP6-mediated growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. To
further validate this notion and its significance, we extended our
studies to in vivo conditions in which DU145 cell variants were
inoculated in male athymic nude mice and were fed with IP6
(2%, w/v) in drinking water from day 6 of xenograft implantation,
a time at which the tumors were distinctly measurable (3 mm in

diameter). Comparing the tumor growth among different DU145
cell variants, DU-p21+p27 cells showed a significantly higher rate
of tumor growth as compared with the DU-EV cells, whereas the
growth rate of DU-p21 and DU-p27 were slightly higher than that
of DU-EV. IP6 treatment slowed down the rate of tumor growth
in all the cell variants, except DU-p21+p27 tumors (Fig. 4A). After
59 days of IP6 treatment, there was a 44%, 40%, and 46% decrease
in tumor volumes in the DU-EV, DU-p21, and DU-p27 groups,
respectively; however, no significant effect (only 11% decrease) was
observed in the DU-p21+p27 group (Fig. 4A). Similarly, IP6 feeding
significantly reduced tumor wet weight by 35% in DU-EV (0.6 g/
mouse in control versus 0.39 g/mouse in IP6-fed group; P < 0.05),
36% in DU-p21 (0.98 g/mouse in control versus 0.62 g/mouse in
IP6-fed group; P < 0.05), and 50% in DU-p27 (1.09 g/mouse in
control versus 0.51 g/mouse in IP6-fed group) tumors (Fig. 4B).
However, in case of DU-p21+p27, no significant effect of IP6 on
tumor weight was observed (1.84 g/mouse in control group versus
1.6 g/mouse in IP6-fed group; Fig. 4B). Thus, consistent with the
in vitro results, IP6 retains its growth arrest efficacy in tumors
with knocked down levels of either p21 or p27. However, DUp21+p27 cells were more tumorigenic than DU-EV cells and did
not respond to IP6 treatment, further underscoring the complementary roles of Cip/Kip proteins and their specificity as targets
of IP6 efficacy under in vivo conditions as well. Western blot
analysis of tumor lysates showed that even at the end of the

tumors, and p27 levels in DU-EV and DU-p21 tumors (Fig. 4C).
There was no significant difference in body weight, water, and
feed consumption between the corresponding control and IP6-fed
animals of all the groups indicating the nontoxic property of this
phytonutrient (data not shown).
Essential role of p21 and p27 in antiproliferative and
proapoptotic effects of IP6 in DU145 tumor xenografts. The
in vivo antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of IP6 in causing
inhibition of PCa xenograft growth and the associated essential
role of p21 and/or p27 were next assessed by analyzing the tumor
samples for PCNA and TUNEL staining. Inhibition of tumor
volume and weight with IP6 administration in the DU-EV group
was associated with concomitant reduction in proliferating cells
(63% of PCNA-positive cells in control group versus 45% in IP6-fed
group; P < 0.001; Fig. 5A and B). Similarly, there was a significant
reduction in cell proliferation in the tumor tissues of DU-p21
( from 68% to 50% PCNA-positive cells; P < 0.001) and DU-p27
( from 69% to 51% PCNA-positive cells; P < 0.001) by IP6 (Fig. 5B).
However, in case of DU-p21+p27 tumors, the effect was not
statistically significant ( from 81% to 74% PCNA-positive cells).
This differential pattern of inhibition of cell proliferation by IP6 in
DU145 cell variant xenografts further corroborates the critical
role of Cip/Kip proteins in mediating the antiproliferative efficacy
of IP6 under in vivo conditions. Quantitative evaluation of apoptosis in tumors showed that IP6 significantly increases the
apoptotic population in DU-EV, DU-p21, and DU-p27 tumors by
2.9-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 5C and D). However,
consistent with our in vitro results, IP6 failed to induce any
significant apoptosis in DU-p21+27 tumors (1.2-fold induction;
Fig. 5C and D).

Discussion
The novel and central finding in the present study is that p21
and p27, the Cip/Kip family proteins, are indispensable in causing
growth arrest and apoptotic death of advanced human PCa DU145
cells by IP6, both in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore, the
simultaneous down-regulation of both p21 and p27 levels results
in DU145 cells with a more aggressive phenotype. In this study, we
found that the more aggressive DU145 cell variant with knockdown
levels of both p21 and p27 was also resistant to IP6-induced cell
growth inhibition and apoptosis under both in vitro and in vivo
conditions, thus establishing p21 and p27 as the primary molecular
targets of IP6 for its antitumor efficacy against PCa.
Cell cycle progression is governed by the well-orchestrated
activation and inactivation of CDKs (29, 30). G1 to S phase
transition plays a crucial role in maintaining the genomic integrity
because this phase is critically linked to external stimuli and also
commits the cells to DNA replication and subsequent mitosis
(31, 32). G1 checkpoint abrogation is a common phenomenon in
carcinogenesis which endows the tumor cells with limitless
replicative potential (17, 24). p21 and p27 physically interact with
CDK via their amino terminal domain and inhibit CDK kinase
activity (29, 30). Thus, activating the G1 checkpoint by upregulating the expression of p21 and p27 is a logical approach
for controlling cancer cell proliferation. Consistent with this
notion, the present study shows that p21 and p27 induction is
the central event in IP6-induced G1 arrest and inhibition of cell

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (3). February 1, 2009

proliferation in DU145 PCa cells. More importantly, this study
provides the evidence that either p27 or p21 in the absence of p53
and Rb can function in the G1 to S transition checkpoint and
mediate IP6-induced G1 arrest and cell growth inhibition in DU145
cells (33, 34). Furthermore, in the absence of all four molecules
(p21, p27, p53, and Rb) the G1 checkpoint in response to IP6 is
abrogated, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation of PCa cells
during IP6 treatment in vivo and in vitro.
Apoptosis-resistance acquired by cancer cells poses a major
barrier to effective treatment (35). Thus, there has been a
significant focus on identifying the agents that could induce the
apoptotic switch in tumor cells (2, 35). Previously, we have shown
that IP6 not only causes G1 arrest but also induces moderate to
high levels of apoptosis in DU145 cells (20). Moreover, it is
believed that sustained G1 arrest eventually drives the cancer cells
to apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the role of p21
and p27 protein levels in mediating the proapoptotic effect of IP6.
Although primarily known for their CDK inhibitory activity, there
are mixed reports for the role of p21 and p27 in apoptosis
induction. For example, adenoviral overexpression of p27 has
been shown to induce apoptosis in various epithelial cancer cell
lines (36). p27 is also reported to cause tumor necrosis factor
receptor 1 accumulation which eventually accounts for its
proapoptotic response (37). In case of p21, depending on its
subcellular localization and cell type, both proapoptotic and
antiapoptotic effects have been reported. For example, nuclear
p21 is associated with apoptosis whereas cytosolic p21 is often
implicated in resistance to apoptosis (38). From the perspective of
chemoprevention studies, the proapoptotic response of various
chemopreventive agents has been associated with the concomitant up-regulation of p21 and/or p27 (24, 39). However, most of
these studies are correlative and the precise connection between
Cip/Kip induction and apoptotic cell death has not often been
clearly dissected. In the present study, stable knockdown of Cip/
Kip proteins reversed IP6-induced apoptotic cell death, clearly
establishing their proapoptotic role, both in vitro and in vivo.
However, the mechanism by which Cip/Kip protein induces
apoptosis by IP6 needs further investigation.
An important aspect of this study is that the growth-inhibitory
and proapoptotic roles of p21 and p27 observed in cell culture were
also retained in vivo in xenograft studies. Moreover, in both
systems, it was consistently observed that p21 and p27 proteins
play compensatory roles because down-regulation of either one of
them was not sufficient to reverse the anticancer effects of IP6.
Compared with DU-EV tumors, only DU-p21+p27 tumors showed a
significantly higher proliferation rate and resistance to apoptosis
even with IP6 administration in xenograft studies, thereby
emphasizing the critical importance of both these molecules and
their relevance to be pursued as prognostic biomarkers of IP6
antitumor efficacy against advanced PCa in which both the tumor
suppressor proteins p53 and Rb are nonfunctional (33, 34).
Moreover, similar studies are desired in other PCa cell lines
differing in tumorigenic grade, as well as in transgenic PCa models,
to establish the comprehensive importance of these molecules for
antitumor responses of IP6. Nevertheless, the mechanistic aspect
and the primary molecular targets identified in this study
underscore the critical tumor suppressor functions of p21 and
p27 (Cip and Kip family) proteins, and also suggest their potential
as biomarkers for tumor progression as well as prognosis ( for IP6
efficacy) in clinical cases of PCa (40, 41). Overall, it could be
suggested that IP6 is a potential nontoxic, readily available

IP6 Inhibits PCa Growth by Up-regulating p21 and p27

chemopreventive dietary agent having potential to control PCa,
which also show antitumor response in the presence of either p21
(Cip1) or p27 (Kip1) in PCa cells harboring nonfunctional p53 and
Rb; the critical tumor suppressors that are frequently mutated in
several types of cancers including PCa. Unlike p53 and Rb, p21 and
p27 are not usually mutated in cancer cells (25). This study
combined with our previous studies with IP6 in PCa cell culture
and animal models, suggest a merit for clinical investigation of IP6
in patients with PCa.
