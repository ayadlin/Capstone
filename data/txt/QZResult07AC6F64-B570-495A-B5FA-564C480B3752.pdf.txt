ABSTRACT:
Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a hypoxia-inducible enzyme that is overexpressed
by cancer cells from many tumor types, and is a component of the pH regulatory
system invoked by these cells to combat the deleterious effects of a high rate of
glycolytic metabolism. CAIX functions to help produce and maintain an intracellular
pH (pHi) favorable for tumor cell growth and survival, while at the same time
participating in the generation of an increasingly acidic extracellular space,
facilitating tumor cell invasiveness. Pharmacologic interference of CAIX catalytic
activity using monoclonal antibodies or CAIX-specific small molecule inhibitors,
consequently disrupting pH regulation by cancer cells, has been shown recently to
impair primary tumor growth and metastasis. Many of these agents are in preclinical
or clinical development and constitute a novel, targeted strategy for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

metabolism to engage the glycoytic pathway, a process
that is far less efficient, but does not rely on the presence
of oxygen. This “glycolytic switch” is often permanent
and persists after reoxygenation, in part because the
byproducts of glycolysis can be used for anabolic reactions
that provide a selective advantage to highly proliferative
tumor cells [3, 4]. The high rate of glycolysis maintained
by cancer cells is the basis for the Warburg effect [3, 5].
The switch to glycolysis by highly metabolically
active tumor cells results in increased production and
export of acidic metabolites, such as lactic and carbonic
acids, to the extracellular space and leads to a decline in
extracellular pH (pHe) [6], creating a toxic intratumoral
microenvironment and providing a selective advantage
for tumor cells that can survive these harsh conditions.
One consequence of extracellular acidification is the
disruption of the intracellular pH (pHi), a decrease in
which rapidly affects basic cellular functions, including
membrane integrity, metabolism and energy production,
and proliferation [4, 6]. Thus, cells must regulate pHi as
the extracellular pH declines, a process particularly critical
for tumor cells that prefer a pHi that is somewhat more

Hypoxia is a salient feature of many types
of solid cancers and arises as the result of spatial
disorganization and flow-based disruption of an abnormal
microvasculature initiated by the growing tumor [1]. The
impact of tumor hypoxia is multifaceted, with effects
on several aspects of tumor biology, including genetic
instability, angiogenesis, invasiveness, survival and
metabolism [1, 2]. Reduced oxygen availability leads to
the activation of a core cellular response to hypoxia, the
master regulators of which are the transcription factors
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and 2 (HIF-1/2) [2]. Initiation
of this core hypoxia-induced signaling cascade results
in the activation of a vast array of genes, and from these
arise signaling outputs that regulate a variety of processes
aimed at adaptation of tumor cells to conditions of low
oxygen [2]. Amongst the stressors imposed by hypoxia,
the reduced supply of oxygen limits the capacity for
oxidative phosphorylation as a means of producing energy
[3, 4]. Hypoxic, HIF-1α-activated tumor cells respond to
this microenvironmental stress by reprogramming their

alkyline compared to that which is optimal for normal
cells [4, 7]. The combination of an increasingly acidic
intratumoral microenvironment and a requirement to
regulate pHi results in the death of non-tumor cells and
accelerates degradation of the extracellular matrix, thereby
promoting the invasion and proliferation of acid-resistant
cancer cells. As such, metabolic alterations induced by
hypoxia can promote activities associated with aggressive
tumor cell behavior, including survival, invasion and
metastasis [8].
The maintenance of pH homeostasis by tumor
cells relies on a set of complex molecular mechanisms
involving a variety of proteins and buffer systems with
the central aim of maintaining a moderately alkaline
pHi while generating a markedly acidic extracellular
environment [4, 6]. One set of proteins important to this
pH regulatory system is the family of carbonic anhydrases
(CAs) [6, 9]. CAs are a family of 16 distinct, but related
metalloenzymes whose major enzymatic function is to
catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2)
to bicarbonate (HCO3- and protons (H+) (CO2 + H2O ↔
HCO3- + H+) [9]. As a group, CAs are important regulators
of a variety of biological processes, including respiration,
acid-base regulation, bone resorption and calcification, and
biosynthetic processes [9]. In the context of tumors, two
particular isoforms, CAIX and CAXII, are associated with
cancer progression, metastasis, and impaired therapeutic
response [4].

Expression of CAIX by tumor cells is generally very
low in normoxia, but levels are strongly induced during
hypoxia [21-23]. The CAIX promoter contains a hypoxia
responsive element (HRE) that is located immediately
upstream of the transcription start site and that binds
HIF-1α [21]. Indeed, HIF-1α is the exclusive regulator
of CAIX activity, in contrast to many hypoxia-induced
genes, and CAIX is often the most strongly upregulated
gene in response to hypoxia in human cancer cells [9, 20].
Additional transcription factor binding sites present in
the CAIX promoter appear to coordinate with the HRE to
promote or amplify the HIF-1 response [20, 24].
Importantly, the signaling pathways, soluble factors,
and microenvironmental conditions that regulate CAIX
transcription converge on the HIF-1 pathway and CAIX
expression is coupled directly both to increased protein
stabilization and transcriptional activity of HIF-1 [20].
However, cancer cells grown to high density in vitro
develop pericellular hypoxia and can upregulate the
expression of CAIX as a consequence increased HIF-1
transcriptional activity, but in the absence of detectable
stabilization of HIF-1, effectively “uncoupling” these
two arms of HIF-1 regulation [20, 25, 26]. Culturing
cancer cells at high density also induces signaling
pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) pathway. Under these conditions, PI3K inhibitors
suppress CAIX expression, revealing that CAIX is driven
by increased transcriptional activity of HIF-1α resulting
from mild hypoxia and PI3K activation [25, 27].
While hypoxia is the key driver of CAIX expression
in cancer cells, there are also data suggesting that
microenvironmental conditions, tumor suppressors and
oncogenic signaling pathways may play a role in specific
circumstances. In studies using glioblastoma cells grown
in normoxia, acidification of the growth media was
associated with increased CAIX promoter activity and
upregulated CAIX expression, and was attributed to
HIF-1 stabilization and activation of extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) [28]. However, modulation of pHe
had no effect on CAIX expression in normoxic HeLa cells
[29], indicating that pH-driven upregulation of CAIX may
be cell-type specific. The role of glucose deprivation has
also been investigated, but results remain inconclusive,
with some studies reporting heightened expression of
hypoxia-induced CAIX in response to restricted glucose
[29], while others have reported reduced CAIX expression
in these conditions [30]. With regard to tumor suppressors,
the best characterized example is the role of VHL in
CAIX upregulation wherein mutation of VHL results in
constitutive stabilization of HIF-1 in normoxia and drives
hypoxia-independent expression of HIF-1 regulated genes,
including CAIX [31]. Indeed, this mechanism results in
the uniformly high CAIX expression reported in clear cell
renal cell carcinoma [31]. P53 has also been shown to
modulate CAIX expression, but again the primary target is
HIF-1 [32]. Similarly, modulation of CAIX activity by the

CAIX BIOCHEMICAL STRUCTURE
CAIX was initially identified as a membranebound protein on the surface of the HeLa human cervical
carcinoma cell line and was named the “MN protein” [10,
11]. However, subsequent analysis of its cDNA sequence
revealed the presence of a 257 aa long extracellular
carbonic anhydrase (CA) domain, resulting in the
acquisition of its current namesake [12, 13]. The recent
solution of the structure of the catalytic domain of CAIX
[14] has provided structural confirmation of its observed
catalytic activity and has aided in more rational drug
design [15-17]. In contrast to other CA isoforms, CAIX
is dimeric [17], is among the most active CA for the CO2
hydration reaction [16] and contains a proteoglycan (PG)like domain immediately adjacent to the catalytic domain,
the presence of which may allow the enzyme to function
most efficiently at more acidic pH values [17, 18]. A single
pass transmembrane domain separates the extracellular
portion of CAIX from a short, intracellular tail that is
involved in regulating its enzymatic activity [19].

REGULATION OF CAIX EXPRESSION
The transcriptional regulation of CAIX has been
reviewed in detail recently [20] and the discussion here
is limited its regulation as it pertains to cancer biology.

PI3K pathway and the ERK pathway have been reported,
but the effects are cell-specific and the modulation of
CAIX is likely secondary to the modulation of relevant
transcription factors (HIF-1, SP1/SP3, AP1) [20, 25, 27].

No effect on the hyperplasia and no dysplasia were noted
when knockout animals were challenged with a high
salt diet [41], although gastric submucosal inflammation
was noted in one mouse strain [41]. Importantly, CAIX
deficiency did not promote tumorgenicity [41], although
aged CAIX null mice may suffer degenerative disease in
the brain. At 8 to 10 months of age, vacuolar degenerative
morphological changes were noted in knockout animals
[42]. Interestingly, CAIX expression is upregulated about
2 –fold in mice null for CAII [43], suggesting the presence
of functional redundancy amongst the CA isozymes.

THE ROLE OF CAIX EXPRESSION IN
NORMAL TISSUE
CAIX expression in normal tissue
CAIX is an especially attractive target for cancer
therapy, in part because it is overexpressed in a wide
variety of solid tumors, but is expressed in a limited
way in normal tissues. Early studies established that the
differential distribution in cancerous versus normal tissue
is not the result of mutations [33]. In human tissue, strong
expression of CAIX is generally limited to the basolateral
surface of proliferating crypt enterocytes of the duodenum,
jejunem and ileal mucosa in the human [34]. However,
diffuse, weak CA IX expression has also been reported in
the epithelia of human male efferent ducts [35], as well as
in occasional foci in the pancreatic acini [36]. Analyses
based on cDNA demonstrated the presence of CA IX
in gall bladder epithelia [33], but protein has not been
detected.
In mice, CAIX expression is evident by days
E11.5-E12.5 [37, 38] and is expressed to significant levels
in the brain, lung, liver and pancreas, while weak signals
are evident in the kidney and stomach [38]. Expression
in the normal adult is restricted to a few tissues, with the
gastric mucosa exhibiting the highest levels of protein
[37]. Post transcriptional control of CAIX may be
evident in some tissues as relatively strong signals were
observed for CAIX mRNA in the kidney and skeletal
muscle of Balb/c mice, but these tissues showed little or
no expression of the protein [37]. Indeed, normal human
kidney and muscle are essentially null for CAIX mRNA
and protein [39]. Mice also show expression of CAIX in
pancreatic acini in a diffusely distributed pattern [37].

CAIX EXPRESSION IN TUMOR TISSUE
The discussion above reinforces the fact that
CAIX expression in the normal adult is highly restricted
and that interference with its function in normal tissue
likely has few, if any, significant consequences, except
perhaps in chronic, age-related situations. On the other
hand, CAIX is overexpressed in many solid tumors and
there is now a well-established relationship between
the expression of CAIX and patient prognosis. CAIX
expression, as detected by immunohistochemical staining
of tissue sections, is upregulated and associated with poor
prognosis in cancers of the lung [44-46], colon [47, 48],
breast [49-51], cervix [52-55], bladder [56], ovaries [57],
brain [58], head and neck [59-61], and oral cavity [62, 63].
Furthermore, recent studies have examined the expression
of CAIX in cohorts of hundreds to thousands of patients
using tissue microarray (TMA) strategies (Table 1). Using
this high throughput platform, CAIX has been validated
as a biomarker of poor prognosis in breast [23, 64], lung
[46], ovarian [57] and bladder cancer [65], as well as in
astrocytomas [66].
While the vast majority of studies support
a correlation between CAIX overexpression and
patient prognosis, a few studies have failed to find a
relationship. For example, in a TMA study of 99 patients
that encompassed pre and post (chemo)radiotherapy
biopsies, CAIX was detected in over 85% of pretreatment specimens [67]. However, the study failed to
find a relationship with prognosis, probably because of
insufficient numbers of patients [67]. On the other hand,
in a series of 166 patients with rectal cancer where full
tissue sections were used, 44% were positive for CAIX
expression and two thirds of these patients showed
moderate to strong staining [48]. High CAIX expression
was indicative of shorter disease-free and disease specific
survival, and was demonstrated to be an independent
poor prognostic biomarker [48]. Similarly, most clinical
studies have demonstrated that a high level of CAIX is a
biomarker of poor prognosis both in local advanced [5255] and in early stage [68, 69] cervical cancer, but some
studies have failed to find a correlation [70].
In addition to overall prognostic information,
interrogation of TMAs has revealed associations between

Phenotypes in CAIX knock-out animals
As would be predicted from the observations of
restricted expression of CAIX in normal adult tissues,
genetic disruption of CAIX expression in mice results in
mild phenotypes. Global knockout of CAIX in mice by
targeted gene disruption resulted in homozygous animals
developing gastric hyperplasia of the glandular epithelium,
including numerous cysts [40]. The hyperplasia was
prominent within 4 weeks after birth and loss of CA
IX expression led to increased numbers of pit cells
and depletion of pepsinogen-secreting chief cells [40].
However, mice developed normally and showed normal
gastric pH, acid secretion and serum gastrin levels [40].

BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF CAIX IN
CANCER CELLS

CAIX overexpression and specific tumor categories. For
example, CAIX is particularly highly expressed in basallike or triple negative breast cancers, a tumor subgroup
with poor prognosis and known resistance to therapy [23,
51]. Tumor type dependence has also been reported in
lung cancer, with a higher percentage of CAIX positive
tumors amongst the squamous cell phenotype [46].
Clinical studies have also revealed a correlation between
CAIX expression and metastatic disease. Most recently,
interrogation of over 3600 human breast cancers provided
definitive evidence of CAIX as an independent biomarker
of poor prognosis for distant metastases [23]. CAIX
expression was interrogated in a TMA series of 930 breast
cancers categorized according to patient survival and
overexpression was correlated with death and metastatic
disease [71]. Several studies have now demonstrated that
CAIX levels are associated with metastasis-free survival
in multivariate analyses [52-54, 69], and high levels of
CAIX expression are associated with greater lymph node
metastases [54, 55].
There is now increasing focus on the use of soluble,
plasma CAIX for clinical detection and prognostic
evaluation. Initial studies involving relatively small sample
sizes showed that soluble, serum CAIX was upregulated
in patients with solid tumors [72, 73] and could be used
to detect clinically relevant disease, although prognostic
impact was not realized. However, recent studies have
shown an association between soluble CAIX and patient
prognosis. Preoperative serum CAIX concentrations in
vulvar cancer correlated with intratumoral expression
and increased serum CAIX levels were associated with
poor prognosis [74]. Serum levels of CAIX in metastatic
breast cancer were also correlated with poor prognosis, as
well as with the incidence of circulating tumor cells [75].
Similarly, in NSCLC, high plasma levels of CAIX were
associated with significantly shorter overall survival [46].

CAIX and control of tumor pH
The role of CAIX in the control of pH dynamics
in solid tumors is now well-recognized [6, 76].
The maintenance of pH homeostasis by tumor cells
encompasses several complex molecular mechanisms
involving a variety of proteins and buffer systems with the
central aim of maintaining a moderately alkaline pHi while
generating a markedly acidic extracellular environment
[6] (Figure 1). Indeed, tumor cells generally favor a
more alkaline pHi than their normal counterparts [4]. A
change in the pHi/pHe ratio of 0.1-0.2 pH units can have
disasterous consequences for critical biological processes
including ATP synthesis, proliferation, migration, survival
and metastasis [6, 8]. The primary enzymatic function of
CAIX is to catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon
dioxide to bicarbonate and protons (CO2 + H2O ↔ HCO3+ H+). The location of the active site of CAIX on the
extracellular surface of the plasma membrane positions it
well for the enzyme to contribute to acidification of the
tumor microenvironment in hypoxia. In fact, CAIX has
been said to act as a “catalytic converter” for the excretion
of acid from cells [77]. Bicarbonate is shuttled into the
cytoplasm to buffer pHi, while the proton remains in the
extracellular space. Thus, CAIX has a dual role in the
growth of hypoxic, CO2 excreting tumors (Figure 1).
First, it helps to produce and maintain an alkyline pHi
favorable for tumor growth. Second, it participates in the
generation of an increasingly acidic extracellular space,
facilitating tumor cell invasiveness [6, 76, 77]. Inhibition
of CAIX interferes with removal of acid and results in a
decrease in pHi, negatively influencing cell survival [76,
77] (Figure 1). Furthermore, low pHe is associated with
tumorigenic transformation, chromosomal rearrangements,
extracellular matrix breakdown, migration and invasion,

protease activation and growth factor production [6, 76].
Inhibition of CAIX would also attenuate these processes,
thereby reducing tumor growth and invasion (Figure 1).

contains three potential phosphorylation sites, 443T, 448S
and 449Y. Data suggest that 449Y plays a role in EGF-Rinduced signaling to Akt [80], while cAMP-mediated
activation of PKA in hypoxia leads to PKA-induced
phosphorylation on 443T of CAIX, resulting in increased
activity [19]. Interestingly, full activation of CAIX also
appears to require dephosphorylation of 448S [19].

Regulation of CAIX activity
Recent data have suggested that the regions flanking
the catalytic domain, in particular the PG-like domain
and the intracellular tail, are critical for modulating the
catalytic activity of CAIX. The PG-like domain allows
CAIX to remain highly catalytically active at low pH
values that would kill most enzymes [17]. Mutagenesis
of a cluster of basic amino acids in the intracellular tail
affected the function of the extracellular catalytic domain,
suggesting that the cytoplasmic tail plays a role in insideout signaling [78, 79]. In addition, the intracellular tail

CAIX in cell adhesion, migration and proliferation
In addition to its role in the regulation of tumoral
pH and tumor cell survival, there is evidence that
CAIX contributes to cell processes such as adhesion
and migration, both of which are vital for metastatic
progression in human cancer. In CAIX-null MDCK

Figure 1: Pharmacologic inhibition of CAIX activity inhibits cancer cell survival and invasion. Hypoxia induces a HIF-

1-mediated signaling cascade that results nuclear translocation of HIF-1α and activation of hypoxia-regulated genes, including GLUT1,
MCT1/4 and CAIX. Cells reprogram their metabolism to engage the glycoytic pathway, a “glycolytic switch” that results in increased
production and export of lactate, leading to a decline in pHe. One consequence of extracellular acidification is the disruption of the
intracellular pH (pHi), a decrease in which rapidly affects basic cellular functions. The overexpression of CAIX in hypoxia catalyzes the
hydrolysis of CO2 to HCO3- and H+ in the extracellular microenvironment. The HCO3- is actively transported into the cancer cell, thereby
regulating pHi and maintaining cell survival. The H+ participate in the generation of an increasingly acidic extracellular space, promoting
tumor cell invasiveness. Inhibition of CAIX catalytic activity using monoclonal antibodies or specific small molecule inhibitors prevent the
production of these enzymatic metabolites, leading to decreased survival and reduced invasive capacity.

Monoclonal antibodies

protein localized to cell-cell junctions and overlapped
with staining for E-cadherin [81]. Reoxygenation of
hypoxia-cultured cells resulted in delocalization of CA
IX and E-cadherin from the membrane to the cytoplasm,
followed by relocalization to the membrane upon return
to hypoxia [81]. CAIX-expressing MDCK cells showed
lower cell adhesion and CA IX immunoprecipitated
with β-catenin in these cells, suggesting that CAIX
may modulate E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion by
competing with E-cadherin for binding to β-catenin
[81]. Gene expression analysis of cervical carcinoma
cells overexpressing exogenous human CAIX revealed
differential regulation of genes involved in cell growth,
cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization [82]. These
cells showed weakened cell-cell adhesion and increased
cell motility. Moreover, constitutive CAIX expression
induced inactivation of Rho and led to EMT in these cells
[82]. The expression of CAIX may also be involved in
cell proliferation. Several studies have also reported a
reduction in proliferation when CAIX is inhibited, at
least in cells exogeneously overexpressing CAIX [83-85].
Together, these studies suggest that inhibition of CAIX in
hypoxic tumors may have anti-tumor effects that extend
beyond control of intratumoral pH.

Immunotherapy using CAIX-specific monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) may derive its therapeutic efficacy
through a variety of mechanisms. Direct binding of
the mAb to CAIX can elicit an anti-tumor response
due to antibody-mediated cell cytotoxicity (ADCC).
Alternatively, receptor-mediated internalization allows
for targeted delivery of various therapeutic payloads,
including cytotoxins and radionuclides. Furthermore,
development of mAbs targeting the CAIX active site
provides potential for selective blocking of CAIX
function.
Historically, two mAbs, M75 [10] and G250 [87],
have dominated as CAIX-specific immunological tools
for clinical detection and/or therapy. M75 is a highlyspecific antibody targeting the PG-like domain of CAIX
and it is used widely for immunohistochemical detection
of CAIX in human tumor tissue [79]. A radiolabeled
derivative has been developed for imaging CAIX in
hypoxic tumors preclinically [88, 89], but M75 has not
been developed for application as an immunotherapy. In
contrast, a chimeric version of G250, cG250, has been
developed and extensively characterized as an anticancer
immunotherapy [90]. Early studies showed that cG250
could elicit antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(ADCC) [91], an established mechanism by which
therapeutic mAbs mediate tumor cell destruction. Phase
I and II trials demonstrated that this Ab was safe, welltolerated and able to positively impact disease burden,
alone and together with interferon (IFN)-α treatment [92,
93]. cG250 is currently marketed by WILEX AG under
the trade name RENCAREX® and phase III trials have
now been initiated using cG250 as an adjuvant therapy
aimed at reducing recurrence in surgically-treated renal
cell carcinoma (RCC) patients who have a high risk of
relapse and in combination with interleukin 2 (IL-2) or
IFN-α for metastatic RCC [4, 79, 92].
While M75 and cG250 are directed at the PGlike domain of CAIX, recent studies have focused on
developing antibodies targeted against its catalytic
domain. These antibodies have the advantage of
specifically disrupting the catalytic activity of the enzyme,
thus targeting its tumorigenic functions, including pH
regulation. High throughput screening technologies,
especially the use of phage display libraries [94-96], have
been employed to efficiently identify CAIX antibodies.
Epitopes of some of the fragments have mapped to the
catalytic site, and these have been shown to inhibit CAIX
activity in vitro [94, 96]. Inhibition of CAIX in spheroid
cell cultures has also been demonstrated, suggesting that
these mAbs could be used to inhibit CAIX therapeutically
[94]. However, in vivo experiments demonstrating efficacy
as anti-tumor agents have not been performed. Two mAbs
generated by phage display and with high affinity to
CAIX have been shown to bind CAIX in tumors in vivo

PHARMACOLOGIC INHIBITION OF
CAIX AS A MEANS OF THERAPEUTIC
INTERVENTION IN CANCER
CAIX is an attractive target for anticancer therapy
for several reasons. It is selectively expressed by tumor
cells and shows highly restricted expression in normal
tissue. It provides functions critical for tumor growth
and metastasis, including pH regulation, survival and
adhesion/migration. It is positioned on the extracellular
surface of cell membranes, allowing efficient targeting
by antibodies or small molecule inhibitors. Furthermore,
genetic silencing of CAIX in preclinical tumor models in
vivo has demonstrated the requirement of CAIX for the
growth of hypoxic tumors and their metastasis. Genetic
depletion of CAIX, together with CAXII, in LS147Tr
colorectal cancer xenografts resulted in an 85% reduction
in tumor growth [86]. Silencing of CAIX expression in
4T1 mouse metastatic breast cancer cells resulted in
regression of orthotopic mammary tumors and inhibition
of spontaneous lung metastasis formation [23]. Stable
depletion of CAIX in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer
xenografts also resulted in attenuation of primary tumor
growth [23]. These studies provide proof of principle data
showing that inhibition of CAIX is of potential therapeutic
benefit. Two major tools that are being investigated for
their efficacy as CAIX-specific therapeutic modalities in
cancer treatment are monoclonal antibodies and small
molecule inhibitors.

[95], but again, evaluation of anti-tumor efficacy was not
performed. On the other hand, a mAb directed against the
CAIX catalytic domain and generated using hybridoma
technology has been developed and tested in vivo [79].
The mAb showed efficient binding, internalization and
persistence in cultured cells. In vivo evaluation in HT29 colorectal xenografts demonstrated that treatment
immediately after cell inoculation effectively limited
tumor growth, but the effect was very modest when tumors
were allowed to establish prior to treatment [79].
While selective inhibition of CAIX catalytic
activity by mAbs exploits the property of mAbs to not
spontaneously cross the plasma membrane, the utility
of mAbs in cancer therapy is often driven by their
ability to undergo receptor-mediated internalization. Ab
internalization is required for delivery of therapeutic
payloads, including radionuclides and cytotoxic drugs, and
CAIX Abs have been developed to exploit this property.
For example, a portion of the cG250 Ab is internalized,
and metallic radionuclides, including 177Lu and 90Y, have
been introduced into cellular lysosomes using cG250 in
mice, producing a therapeutic growth delay in xenograft
tumors [97]. A phase I/II trial in metastatic RCC patients is
currently ongoing [98]. In a very recent study a CAIX mAb
identified from a phage display library was conjugated to
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and the efficacy of
this Ab-drug conjugate (BAY79-4620) was evaluated in
several preclinical human xenograft tumor models [99].
Drug delivery to target cells involved internalization of
the mAb and anti-tumor efficacy correlated with CAIX
expression, with tumors showing the most robust levels of
CAIX expression also having the best therapeutic response

[99].

CAIX-specific small molecule inhibitors
Several broad classes of small molecules are
known to effectively inhibit CAs [4, 9], and compounds
based on sulfonamide/sulfamates and coumarins have
demonstrated particular promise as potential anti cancer
agents. Interestingly, these two inhibitor classes are
mechanistically distinct in their inhibition of CAs. The
sulfonamides inhibit CAIX by coordinating to the zinc ion
within the active site, while molecules based on coumarin/
thiocoumarin act as suicide inhibitors, undergoing
hydrolysis to 2-hydroxycinnamic acids and binding

Evaluation of CAIX inhibitors in cell culture
The high degree of homology amongst the catalytic
sites of the various mammalian CAs has presented a
challenge to the design and development of isozymespecific agents. The development of compounds that
selectively inhibit tumor associated, extracellular CAs
without “off-target” inhibition of intracellular CAs such
as CAII is critical for their use as cancer therapeutics
[4, 9]. Several strategies have evolved to “dial in” the
selectivity of small molecule inhibitors of CAIX, such
as the addition of charges species, bulky entities such
as FITC or albumin or hydrophilic sugar moieties, all of
which limit transport across the plasma membrane [4, 9].

Evaluation of selective CAIX inhibitors in
preclinical models

Other approaches include the use of distinct chemotypes of
sulfonamides [102] or coumarins [103] that are inherently
selective for extracellular CAs such as CAIX. Many of
these compounds have been evaluated as both potent
and selective for CAIX based on in vitro assays using
recombinant CAs. In some studies, efficient attenuation of
cell growth by a series of chemically defined CA inhibitors
has been demonstrated using panels of cultured tumor
cell lines representing a variety of types of cancers [104,
105]. While these studies have identified CA inhibitors as
potential anti-cancer therapeutics, the experiments were
performed in normoxia without analysis of CAIX status,
thus evaluation of the specific role of CAIX on tumor cell
viability was not possible. Indeed, these studies suggest
that some of these CA inhibitors may work effectively
as cytotoxic agents in cancer therapy [104, 105]. Ideally,
inhibitors that specifically target CAIX-overexpressing
cancer cells while exhibiting no effects on normal, CAIXnegative cells would be desired.
A growing number of selective CAIX inhibitors
have been evaluated in cell culture models and have
provided evidence both of their CAIX-specific nature
and their potential as anti-tumor agents. To date, the best
characterized CAIX-selective small molecule inhibitor
is a FITC-labeled fluorescent sulfonamide [9]. This
compound has a high affinity for extracellular CAs. Cell
culture studies using both MDCK cells that overexpress
CAIX and human tumor cell lines that constitutively
express CAIX or induce the enzyme in hypoxia have
demonstrated that this inhibitor binds only to active
CAIX in hypoxia [23, 106] and inhibits CAIX-mediated
acidification of the extracellular environment [23, 106,
107]. Interestingly, similar data was reported recently
for a fluorescently labeled sulfamate [84]. The influence
of CAIX inhibitors on cancer cell viability has also been
investigated. Human renal carcinoma cell lines with or
without constitutive expression of CAIX, together with
cell density dependent upregulation of CAIX in HeLa
cells, were used as models to test the functional impact of
two aromatic sulfonamides, TR1 and GA15 [83]. Results
showed that these inhibitors preferentially reduced pHi
and proliferation, and induced apoptosis and ceramide
production in CAIX-positive cells, but not in CAIXnegative cells [83]. Treatment with an indanesulfonamide
CAIX inhibitor in HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells
resulted in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis,
but did not affect intrinsic radiosensitivity in this cell line
[84]. Such studies demonstrate that sulfonamide inhibitors
can be engineered to bind selectively to CAIX and inhibit
its biological functions in cell culture. Interestingly, some
of these experiments were carried out in normoxia [83],
suggesting that certain CAIX inhibitors may function
regardless of hypoxia-induced activation. Thus, these
inhibitors can negatively impact cancer cell viability in a
CAIX-dependent manner.

Despite great scientific interest in CAIX as a
biomarker, imaging target and therapeutic target for
hypoxic tumors, preclinical evaluation of targeted agents
remains in its infancy. The paucity of appropriate, CAIXpositive preclinical models and the complexities involved
in synthesizing small molecule inhibitors that are highly
selective for the CAIX isozyme remain as challenges
in the field [4, 23, 108]. Recently, however, progress
has been made in developing small molecule inhibitors
with reasonable selectivity for extracellular CAIX that
demonstrate efficacy in vivo (Table 2).
Initial attempts to target CAIX therapeutically in
vivo used inhibitors based on acetazolamide, onto which
albumin binding moieties or charged flurophores were
attached, thereby restricting the binding of acetazolamide
to extracellular CAs [109]. The fluorophore-conjugated
inhibitor bound to LS174T human colon carcinoma
xenograft tissue in a pattern similar to that seen with
antibodies against CAIX, but a decrease in tumor growth
was not observed in this model [109]. However, treatment
of SK-RC-52 human renal cell carcinoma xenografts
constitutively expressing CAIX with the albumin-binding
variant did produce a significant decrease in tumor growth
[109]. The inhibitor was also effective when used in
combination with sunitinib, although the combination
treatment did not significantly outperform sunitinib alone
[109], likely because of the high efficacy of sunitinib in
this tumor model. More recently, one of several potent bissulfonamide CAIX inhibitors identified in a screen of 1
million compounds in a DNA-encoded chemical library
was found to exhibit strong tumor-specific accumulation
in these tumor models [110]. Tumor-specific, oxygendependent localization of the established fluorescent
sulfonamide inhibitor of CAIX in HT-29 colon carcinoma
xenografts has also been reported [111]. While tumor
growth inhibition per se was not measured in these studies,
the results indicate the ability of highly selective CAIX
inhibitors to bind specifically to their target in vivo.
Recent studies have now demonstrated that
CAIX-selective sulfonamide inhibitors can directly and
specifically inhibit the growth of hypoxic, CAIX-positive
tumors in preclinical animal models. Treatment of hypoxic,
metastatic 4T1 mouse breast tumors in an orthotopic
setting with an established fluorescent sulfonamide CAIX
inhibitor resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth,
whereas similar treatment of primary tumors derived
from non-metastatic 67NR cells did not have an effect on
tumor growth [23]. Furthermore, delivery of novel ureido
sulfonamide [102] and glycosyl coumarin [103] inhibitors
of CAIX into human and mouse models of orthotopic,
CAIX-positive breast cancer resulted in significant
inhibition of primary tumor growth. An anti-tumor effect
has also been demonstrated recently by inhibiting CAIX
91

using an indanesulfonamide [84]. Interestingly, treatment
of HT-29 xenografts with this high affinity inhibitor
of CAIX resulted in reduced tumor growth, and further
regression what observed when the inhibitor was used in
combination with radiotherapy [84]. Collectively, these
studies provide strong preclinical evidence for the use of
CAIX inhibitors as targeted pharmacologic agents for the
treatment of hypoxic, aggressive solid cancers.
In addition to their effects on the growth of hypoxic
primary tumors, recent data suggest that sulfonamide and
coumarin inhibitors of CAIX activity are efficacious in
reducing metastatic burden in preclinical models of cancer.
In two separate studies, treatment of experimental models
of breast cancer metastasis with novel ureido sulfonamides
has resulted in a significant decrease in lung metastases
[23, 102]. Similar results have been achieved using novel
glycosyl coumarins [23, 103], suggesting that this new
generation of selective CAIX inhibitors have the capacity
to work as targeted therapeutics for both the treatment
of primary tumors and metastatic progression, at least in
breast cancer.

without “off-target” inhibition of intracellular CAs.
However, several CAIX-targeted therapeutic agents,
including monoclonal antibodies and small molecule
inhibitors, have been developed recently. Today, selective
monoclonal antibody therapies have entered clinical
trials and several additional antibody-based modalities
show promise in experimental models. Importantly,
inhibition of CAIX with sulfonamide- or coumarinbased inhibitors is efficacious in reducing tumor growth
and inhibiting metastasis in preclinical tumor models
without the compromising effects of non-specific toxicity.
These attributes suggest that such inhibitors are likely
to be useful clinically, especially if administered in
combination with conventional chemotherapy. Indeed,
the use of nontoxic targeted therapies in combination
with conventional anticancer drugs or radiotherapy is the
current clinical paradigm, and the inhibition of CAIX in
this context may yield even better efficacy.

CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
As solid malignancies progress, they often become
hypoxic, triggering a core, HIF-1-mediated signaling
cascade that results in the activation of a plethora of genes
vital for the adaptation of tumor cells to an increasingly
stressful environment. As part of this response, tumor cells
undergo a glycolyic switch that enables them to continue
to grow in conditions of low oxygen. As a consequence
of this altered metabolism, acidic metabolites are released
into the extracellular environment, lowering the pHe and
putting pressure on tumor cells to maintain their pHi.
Therefore, cancer cells become increasingly reliant on a
multi-component pH regulatory system for their continued
survival and invasive behavior, and interference with one
or more effectors of this system can prove detrimental to
tumor growth.
CAIX is a hypoxia-inducible component of the
tumoral pH regulatory system. Its upregulation results in
dramatically enhanced hydrolysis of CO2 to HCO3- and
H+ at the extracellular surface of cancer cells, providing
a chemical buffer that is actively transported into the cell
to help maintain pHi and a source of H+ that contributes
to the increasing acidosis of the extracellular space. As
discussed here, it is now well-recognized that CAIX is
highly overexpressed in several solid cancer types, in
sharp contrast to the restricted expression of this protein
in normal tissues, making it a clinically relevant target for
novel cancer therapeutics.
Preclinical and clinical evaluation of novel CAIXselective therapies have, until recently, been slowed by
the lack of availability of appropriate animal models
and the development of chemical compounds that
selectively inhibit tumor associated, extracellular CAs
