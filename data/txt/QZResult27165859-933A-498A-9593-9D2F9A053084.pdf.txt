Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous and clinically aggressive disease for
13
which there is no targeted therapy - . BET bromodomain inhibitors, which have shown efficacy in
4-6
several models of cancer , have not been evaluated in TNBC. These inhibitors displace BET
bromodomain proteins such as BRD4 from chromatin by competing with their acetyllysine
79
recognition modules, leading to inhibition of oncogenic transcriptional programs - . Here we
report the preferential sensitivity of TNBCs to BET bromodomain inhibition in vitro and in vivo,
establishing a rationale for clinical investigation and further motivation to understand mechanisms
of resistance. In paired cell lines selected for acquired resistance to BET inhibition from
previously sensitive TNBCs, we failed to identify gatekeeper mutations, new driver events or drug
pump activation. BET-resistant TNBC cells remain dependent on wild-type BRD4, which supports
transcription and cell proliferation in a bromodomain-independent manner. Proteomic studies of
resistant TNBC identify strong association with MED1 and hyper-phosphorylation of BRD4
attributable to decreased activity of PP2A, identified here as a principal BRD4 serine phosphatase.
Together, these studies provide a rationale for BET inhibition in TNBC and present mechanismbased combination strategies to anticipate clinical drug resistance.

To explore non-oncogene addiction to BRD4 in breast cancer, we studied a series of BET
bromodomain inhibitors (BBI) across breast cell lines reflecting transcriptionally-defined
2 10
breast cancer subtypes: luminal, HER2+, and TNBC , as well as MCF10A and MCF12A
basal/mesenchymal immortalized mammary epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 1). Potent
inhibitory effects were observed preferentially in TNBC lines, compared to more resistant
luminal lines (Fig. 1a). Analysis of potency of drug response and subtype or known driver
mutations identified the basal subtype as the only significant association (p=0.0475)
(Supplementary Table 1 and D.N.S.). BRD4 dependency was confirmed by RNAi and
phenocopied BBI (Extended data Fig. 1a-c). JQ1 or BRD4 knock-down induced growth
inhibition resulted in G1 arrest and apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 1d-g). Expression of
factors described to mediate JQ1 effect (MYC) or required for TNBC growth (JAK2/STAT3)
showed no clear association with JQ1 sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 1h and Extended Data
Fig. 2a,b). JQ1 treatment of TNBC cells induced significant morphologic changes consistent
with induction of senescence confirmed by β-galactosidase staining and luminal

differentiation evidenced by changes in the expression of basal and luminal markers
(Extended Data Fig. 2c-d and Fig. 1b).
Extending the translational significance of these findings, we evaluated the ability of JQ1 to
inhibit tumor growth in murine TNBC xenografts. Two week treatment efficiently inhibited
established tumor growth from SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 lines, and patient-derived
primary human TNBC xenografts (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). Down-regulation of
BRD4 using two independent TET-inducible shRNAs produced even more pronounced
effects leading to complete tumor regression and failure to regrow even after discontinuing
doxycycline treatment (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2g). Evidence of BBI-induced basalto-luminal differentiation was confirmed in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 2f,h).

Using integrated epigenomic analysis (Supplementary Table 2), we identified the direct
transcriptional targets of BBI in TNBC. BBI binding was identified at active promoter and
11
enhancer regions using ChemSeq for biotinylated JQ1 (Bio-JQ1) enrichment and ChIP-seq
for acetyl-histone (H3K27ac) and BRD4 enrichment, with the three marks showing near
perfect co-localization (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 3a). BBI efficiently displaced
chromatin-bound BRD4 in treated SUM159 (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3b) and in
SUM149 cells (Extended Data Fig. 3c). To identify biologically relevant, direct targets of
BBI in SUM159 and SUM149 cells, we quantified binding of Bio-JQ1 and BRD4 genomewide and found strong enrichment at 219 and 159 super-enhancers, respectively (SEs; Fig.
8 9 12 13
1f and Extended Data Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 3) , , , . TFs with known roles in
14
15
breast cancer, such as POU5F1B/MYC and HIF1α , were evident among top SEassociated genes in both lines. Kinetic effects of JQ1 treatment on gene expression
demonstrated preferential SE-associated gene down-regulation (Fig. 1g and Extended Data
Fig. 3e,f). Expression changes were observed within 3 hours after JQ1 treatment and, as
expected, more genes were significantly down- than up-regulated (Extended Data Fig. 3g-j,
16
and Supplementary Table 4). Unsupervised Metacore analysis of JQ1 affected target
pathways revealed down-regulation of regulatory and effector genes in anti-apoptotic and
JAK/STAT signaling pathways (Extended Data Fig. 3k). These data support selective
disruption of SE-associated genes by JQ1, leading to deregulation of coordinated
transcriptional pathways involved in cell proliferation, invasion, and survival.

Dissecting resistance to targeted therapy is critical to elucidate mechanisms of drug and
target action, and to suggest approaches to treat or anticipate drug resistance in patients.
Therefore, we established BBI-resistant TNBC cell lines by long-term culture of both
SUM159 and SUM149 cells in escalating JQ1 doses. Low (0.5 μM) and high (2.0 μM) doses
of JQ1 severely impaired proliferation of parental SUM159 and SUM149 lines, reducing
viable cells after 6 days (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3l). In contrast, JQ1-resistant cells
(SUM159R and SUM149R) proliferated linearly, even in high JQ1 doses (20 μM) (Fig. 2a
and Extended Data Fig. 3l). BBI-resistance is not attributable to drug export, as MDR1 and
other transporters are not transcriptionally up-regulated (Extended Fig. 4a), co-incubation
with MDR1 inhibitors (verapamil) had no effect (Extended Data Fig. 4b), and structurally
divergent BBIs are equally inactive as JQ1 (Fig. 2b). Further support is provided by the
equivalent chromatin engagement of BRD4 in sensitive and resistant cells, demonstrated by
ChemSeq with Bio-JQ1 (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Notably, BBI-resistant TNBC cells retain

sensitivity to compounds from orthogonal active drug classes, such as CXCR2 and JAK2
17
inhibitors ; establishing specific resistance to BBIs (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Adaptive drug
resistance was not attributable to outgrowth of a minor subpopulation of pre-existing
resistant cells, as 10 independent single cell-derived clones showed similar resistance
profiles to pooled SUM159R cells (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Similar results were obtained in
vivo, as SUM159R derived xenografts derived were JQ1 unresponsive (Extended Data Fig.
4f). In all resistant TNBC populations studied, exome sequencing failed to identify
alterations in BET bromodomain-encoding genes (e.g., gatekeepers) or known driver genes
(parallel pathway activation; Supplementary Table 5).

Author Manuscript

Absent new genetic alterations, we explored the plausibility of an epigenomic mechanism of
resistance. Differential enhancer analysis revealed a significant gain of SEs in resistant
SUM159R cells (ChemSeq; Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 6). The gain of Bio-JQ1 SEs
was associated with enrichment for BRD4 binding to these genomic loci (Fig. 2d) and
increased transcription of associated genes (Fig. 2e). An upstream/intragenic region of
H3k27ac at the BCL-xL locus featured prominently among top gained SEs in SUM159R
(Fig. 2f), consistent with increased BCL-xL mRNA and protein expression in resistant cells
(Supplementary Table 7, Extended Data Fig. 4g). Functionally, cells with acquired resistance
to BBI featured a concordant switch in JQ1 anti-apoptotic response based on dynamic BH3
18 19
profiling , (Extended Data Fig. 4h).

Observing emergent enhancers in resistant cells, we assessed whether BBI-resistant TNBC
cells retained non-oncogene addiction to BRD4. Notably, we observed loss of SUM159R
cell viability upon BRD4 knockdown (Extended Data Fig. 5,b). Together these studies
establish persistence of BRD4 addiction despite resistance to bromodomain inhibition,
establishing the plausibility of bromodomain-independent recruitment of BRD4 to enhancers
in BBI-resistant TNBCs. To test this hypothesis, we performed BRD4 ChIP-seq on sensitive
and resistant cells with and without JQ1. JQ1 neither displaced BRD4 from chromatin in
SUM159R (Fig. 2g), nor meaningfully influence epigenome structure by H3K27ac ChIP-seq
(Extended Data Fig. 5c-g). Notably, several luminal markers (FOXA1, CD24, and luminal
cytokeratins) were elevated in SUM159R cells in cell culture and in vivo (Extended Data
Fig. 5h,i), supporting a model whereby resistance arises via essential BRD4 recruitment to
chromatin in a bromodomain-independent manner. Similar observations were made in
SUM149R cells and in TNBC cells inherently resistant to JQ1 (Extended Data Fig. 3h-j;
Extended Data Fig. 6a-d), suggesting a general mechanism of epigenomic resistance to BBI.

To disclose potential differences in BRD4-associated complexes between sensitive and
resistant SUM159 cells, we performed quantitative proteomics using RIME (rapid
20
immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins) with and without JQ1.
Analysis of BRD4-associated proteins identified relative enrichment of MED1 and BRD3 in
JQ1-treated resistant cells (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 7, and Supplementary Table 8).
BRD4 immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot for MED1 and BRD3 revealed that
JQ1 efficiently displaced BRD4 from MED1 in sensitive cells, but not in resistant cells (Fig.
3b), a result confirmed in SUM149 and BBI-resistant SUM149R, as well as inherently
resistant TNBC and luminal lines (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Though elevated BRD3
abundance was observed in SUM159R, increased association of BRD4 and BRD3 was not

confirmed by immunoblot, (Fig. 3b). To assess functionally whether increased recruitment
of BRD4 to chromatin by MED1 underlies resistance to JQ1, we expressed an exogenous
bromodomain-inactivated mutant (BDmut) with concomitant knock-down of endogenous
BRD4 (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). Downregulation of endogenous BRD4 decreased cell
growth both in parental and resistant cells, which was rescued by enforced expression of
wild type BRD4 (Fig. 3c). BDmut BRD4 expression failed to rescue parental SUM159 cells,
but supported growth of JQ1-resistant SUM159R consistent with an evident bromodomainindependent mechanism of BRD4 recruitment (Fig. 3c). Next, we assessed the sensitivity of
cells expressing BDmut BRD4 to JQ1, observing increased sensitivity to JQ1 In parental
SUM159 cells exogenously expressing BDmut (Fig. 3d). In contrast, expression of BDmut
BRD4 in SUM159R cells rescued the anti-proliferative effect of JQ1 (Fig. 3e), although this
could partially be due to the slower growth of BDmut expressing cells. Together, these
studies suggest BBI-resistance is associated with increased binding of BRD4 to MED1, in a
bromodomain-independent manner unaffected by JQ1.

A recent study reported that the stability and nuclear localization of BRD4 is increased with
21
phosphorylation by casein kinase II (CK2) . To explore the contribution of BRD4
phosphorylation to BBI-resistance, we performed immunoblot analysis in parental and
resistant cells and found a marked increase of phospho-BRD4 (pBRD4) in resistant cells
(Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8d). Small-molecule inhibition of CK2 decreased BRD4
phosphorylation in SUM159 and SUM159R cells (Extended Data Fig. 8e). These results
imply BRD4 hyperphosphorylation in resistant cells either due to increased phosphorylation
by CK2 or, alternatively, to decreased dephosphorylation by an as yet unidentified BRD4
phosphatase. We therefore first analyzed CK2 activity in parental and resistant cells by
performing pan-CK2 substrate immunoblots and detected no significant differences in CK2
activity (Extended Data Fig. 8f).

Author Manuscript

Inactivation of the PP2A phosphatase tumor suppressor gene occurs commonly in breast
22
cancer and is associated with therapy resistance ; PP2A also often opposes CK2
23,24
function
. Thus, we investigated whether PP2A may dephosphorylate BRD4 and whether
decreased PP2A activity could lead to BBI-resistance. Downregulation of PP2A catalytic
subunit (PP2CA) in SUM149 and SUM159 cells led to increased BRD4 phosphorylation,
establishing PP2A as a previously unrecognized BRD4 phosphatase (Fig. 4b), further
supported by pharmacologic inhibitors of PP2A that showed similar effects (Extended Data
Fig. 8g). To strengthen the link between PP2A activity and BBI-resistance, we tested the
JQ1 sensitivity of SUM149 cells following the knock-down of PP2A C subunit and
determined that downregulation of PP2A decreased JQ1 sensitivity (Fig. 4c). We have
collaboratively reported phenothiazine compounds as activators of PP2A enzymatic
25
activity . Thus, we analyzed pBRD4 levels in SUM159R, SUM149R, and other cell lines
after short-term treatment with phenothiazine (PTZ) and detected rapid dephosphorylation
of BRD4 (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8h). Combined treatment with PTZ and JQ1
overcame BBI-resistance in SUM159R cells (Fig. 4e). To investigate the functional role of
BRD4 hyperphosphorylation in BBI-resistance, we analyzed whether BRD4
phosphorylation influences MED1 binding. Indeed, SUM159R cells treated with CK2
inhibitor or PTZ both lead to decreased MED1 abundance in BRD4 immunoprecipitations,
suggesting that pBRD4 binds MED1 more efficiently than BRD4 (Fig. 4f,g).

To functionally assess the role for BRD4 phosphorylation in BBI-resistance and MED1
binding, we generated BRD4 constructs encoding mutants that cannot be phosphorylated by
CK2 (7 serine to alanine substitutions; “7A mutant”) or mimic constitutive phosphorylation
(7 serine to aspartate substitutions; “7D mutant”). We first assessed the ability of these
constructs to rescue effects of endogenous BRD4 knock-down in stable cell lines (Extended
Data Fig. 8b,c). We observed expression of both 7D and 7A mutants supporting the growth
of both parental SUM159 and JQ1-resistant SUM159R cells (Fig. 3d). Next, we analyzed
MED1 binding and subcellular localization of 7A and 7D mutants +/− JQ1. We found that
the 7A mutant displays weaker MED1 binding compared to WT BRD4 and completely
dissociates after JQ1 whereas the 7D mutant seems to have higher affinity for MED1 that
unaffected by JQ1 treatment (Fig. 4h and Extended Fig. 8i). Lastly, we assessed the
sensitivity of cells expressing 7A or 7D mutant BRD4 to JQ1. In parental SUM159 cells
exogenously expressed 7D mutant BRD4 decreased sensitivity to JQ1 whereas the 7A
mutant slightly increased sensitivity (Fig. 4i). In contrast, expression of 7A mutant BRD4 in
SUM159R cells restored JQ1 sensitivity whereas the 7D mutant showed a modest decrease.
These results strongly support the hypothesis that hyperphosphorylation of BRD4 arises
from decreased PP2A activity in BBI resistant cells leading to increased binding of BRD4 to
MED1, recruitment to chromatin and decreased responsiveness to bromodomain inhibition.

To explore the clinical relevance of phospho-BRD4 (pBRD4) in BET inhibitor-naive TNBC,
we performed immunofluorescence analysis of a tissue microarray (TMA) featuring of 89
patient-derived TNBC specimens. First, we validated the pBRD4 immunofluorescence assay
by comparing xenografts derived from SUM159 and SUM159R cell lines and detected
significantly higher pBRD4 in SUM159R cells (Extended Data Fig. 9a). We detected strong
pBRD4 staining among a subset of TNBCs (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c), and variable staining
overall that was not correlated with expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and basal
cytokeratins (bCK; Extended Fig. 9d,e) and it was not significantly associated with disease
outcomes (Supplementary Table 9 and Extended Data Fig. 9f).
To extend the translational relevance of our findings, we conducted synergy studies of JQ1
with molecules targeting BCL-xL (ABT737), a gained super-enhancer in SUM159R cells,
and modulators of BRD4 phosphorylation, the CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 and the PP2A
activator perphenazine (PPZ). We observed significant synergy between JQ1 and all three
compounds studied (Extended Data Fig. 10), establishing a rationale for combination studies
of BBI in TNBC to improve response and to anticipate BBI resistance.

BRD4 inhibition has demonstrated efficacy in disparate models of cancer in a rapidly
expanding literature. Despite apparent resistance in the vast majority of tumor types, as we
observed here in TNBC, mechanisms of BBI-resistance have not been mechanistically
explained. As this research was in review, two studies reported moderate emergent resistance
to BBI in murine AML associated phenotypically with a stem-like state and WNT pathway
26 27
activation , . Interestingly, in our study TNBCs with more basal/stem cell-like features and
WNT pathway activation are more sensitive to BET inhibition, whereas resistant disease
emerges as epigenomic adaptation to a more differentiated luminal phenotype. Our findings

staining in resistant disease should be studied in these murine AML models and further in
human leukemia.
Integrating approaches in epigenomics, proteomics, and chemical biology, we provide an
example of epigenomic drug resistance by an epigenetic mechanism, where in BBI resistant
cells, decreased PP2A activity leads to hyperphosphorylated BRD4, which binds more
strongly to MED1, facilitating a bromodomain-independent chromatin recruitment
mechanism. This research proposes putative combination strategies to anticipate and
overcome BBI resistance, including pairing with BCL-xL inhibitors (e.g., ABT-737) or CK2
inhibitors, and guides the development of second-generation BBIs that disrupt BET function
via orthogonal biophysical or biochemical actions. More immediately, the robust efficacy
observed in pre-clinical models supports the development of BET inhibition in TNBC alone,
and in combination with mechanism-based targeted therapies.

METHODS
Cell lines and breast tumor tissues

Author Manuscript

Breast cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and Dr. Steve Ethier, University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, MI (SUM series). Cells were cultured in media recommended by the provider,
their identity was confirmed by STR analysis, and they were regularly tested for
mycoplasma. Breast tumor samples were collected using protocols approved by the DF/HCC
Institutional Review Board, informed consent was obtained from all patients. Tumors were
minced with razor blades and digested with stirring for 3-4 hours at 37°C in DMEM/F12
with 2 mg/mL BSA, 2 mg/mL collagenase type IV, and 2 mg/mL hyaluronidase. After
digestion, cells were filtered through 500-micron mesh, washed in DMEM/F12 with 5%
FBS, frozen in DMEM/F12 with 5% FBS and 10% DMSO, and stored in liquid nitrogen for
subsequent xenograft studies. PDX IDC50 was derived from a primary tumor of highly
invasive metaplastic TNBC resistant chemo and radiation therapy leading to the rapid death
of the patient. Exome sequencing of the tumor and xenograft identified numerous mutations
including heterozygous frameshift mutation in PTEN (chr10_89701964-89701964_A) and
CDH1 chr16_67400242-67400242_C). PDX EL-12-58 was derived from a liver metastasis
of a heavily pretreated basal-like TNBC, Oncopanel mutation testing identified homozygous
mutations in BRCA2 (p.S1970*), TP53 (p.I232fs), TSC2, FLT3, and ROS1, and lower
frequency mutations in RAD21, JAK3, ARID1B, ARID1A, KDM6A.
High-Throughput Screening of BET Bromodomain Inhibitors in breast cell line panel

Author Manuscript

We tested a panel of compounds (synthesized in the Bradner lab) in 40 human breast cell
lines in a 384-well format at 2,000 cells per well using a semi-automated screen essentially
5
as described . Cell viability at 72 hr was evaluated using ATPlite (Perkin Elmer).
Synergy Studies
SUM149, SUM149R, SUM159, and SUM159R cells were seeded in sterile, white, opaque
384-well microtiter plates (Thermo), using an automated dispensing system (BioTek
EL406), at 1,000 cells per well in 50 μl of media. Drugs were delivered in DMSO by robotic
pin transfer with a JANUS workstation (100 nl) to achieve a matrix of pairwise dose-

response incubations of each compound, each pair having eight replicates. Following 72
hours of incubation, ATP levels were determined for treated cells and vehicle controls
(ATPlite, PerkinElmer). Data were normalized to vehicle controls. Combination indices
28
were determined using the median-effect principle of Chou and Talalay (CalcuSyn
Software). Isobologram plots were generated with GraphPad Prism software. Points
represent paired values of drug concentrations assessed for synergism. The diagonal line
signifies drug additivity. Points above the line represent antagonistic drug combinations, and
those below the line represent synergistic drug combinations. Synergy assays were
performed in triplicates and repeated 2-3 times.
Xenograft assays

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

For xenograft assays 5-6-weeks old female CrTac:NCr-Foxn1nu and NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid
Il2rgtm1Sug/JicTac mice were purchased from Taconic. Tumors were induced by bilateral
orthotopic mammary fat pad injection of 1×106 cells in 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in
DMEM/F12 or Medium 171 (except for IDC50-X cells, which were injected with 3% FBS
and 4 mg/ml collagen gel in Medium 171). Animal experiments were conducted following
protocol 11-023 approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use
Committee. For all the xenograft studies, the sample size of each group (5-10 mice) is
indicated in the figures. We performed pilot experiments using a few (5-10) mice/group
followed by larger studies if needed to reach statistical significance and repeated
experiments to ensure reproducibility. Due to the nature of the performed experiments, no
randomization and no blinding was used as it was deemed unfeasible. However, the resulting
tumors were analyzed in a blinded manner. Mice were administered JQ1 (50mg/kg, daily),
vehicle only (control) for 14 days beginning at day 14 (SUM159), or doxycycline at day 21
(SUM159-shBRD4) after injection. Mice were euthanized and tumors evaluated 28 and 60
days after injection of parental and TET-inducible shBRD4-expressing SUM159 cells into
mammary fat pads.
Cellular viability, senescence, MDR, and BH3 profiling assays

Author Manuscript

Cell viability and growth assays (Fig. 1a, Fig. 2a,b, Fig. 3d,e, Fig. 4c,i, Extended Fig. 1a,b,
Extended Fig. 3i, Extended Fig. 4d,e,g,h, Extended Fig. 10), cycle, apoptosis, and MDR
assays were performed in triplicates and repeated 2-3 times. For cell proliferation assays,
cells were plated at 500 cells per well in 96-well plates and treated the next day with
inhibitors, DMSO or doxycycline (500ng). Cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in the
media described-above, and cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo three days after
treatments. For cell growth assays, cells were plated at 5000 (SUM159) or 20000 (SUM149)
cells per well in 6-well plates and treated the next day with inhibitors. Cells were counted
every three days by cell counter. Cellular apoptosis was analyzed with an APC AnnexinV/
7ADD Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Pharmingen). AnnexinV/7AAD assessments and cell
cycle graphics were generated using FlowJo software V7.6.1 for Windows (Tree Star).
Senescence Beta-gal staining was performed using Senescence β-Galactosidase staining kit
from Cell signaling. Briefly, after JQ1 treatment (500nM) for 72h, SUM159 and MDAMB-231 cells were fixed by Fixative Solution for 15 min, followed by β-Galactosidase
solution incubation overnight at 37 °C. The staining was checked under microscope for the
development of blue color. Multi-Drug Resistance Assay was performed with MDR assay

kit from Cayman Chemical (600370). Briefly, SUM159 and SUM159R cells were treated
with JQ1 or DMSO for 30 min in SUM medium. Verapamil was used as a positive control at
1:1000 dilution. Calcein AM/Hoechst Dye staining solution was added after that and cells
were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were analyzed by fluorescent microscope and
FACS. Cell cycle analysis was performed 72 hr after JQ1 treatment or BRD4
downregulation with doxycycline using propidium iodide (PI) staining. Cells were
resuspended in 1 ml of growth medium supplemented with 2 μg/ml PI (Life Technologies)
as final concentration. After 60 min at 37°C in the dark, analysis was performed on a FACS
AriaII cytometer (BD Biosciences). The cell cycle was plotted as histogram after excluding
doublets. Cell synchronization Procedure. SUM159 cells were treated with nocodazole
(200ng/ml) for 12h and then cells were tapped to detach from the plates. After washing
twice with PBS, cells were replated with or without JQ1 in collagen coated plates. Cells
were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12 h time point for FACS and immunoblot analysis. Dynamic BH3

profiling was performed using the JC-1 plate method as previously described , . Briefly,
2.5×105 cells were seeded in T25 flasks in the presence of 500 nM or 5 μM JQ1 for 72 or 96
hours. Cells were trypsinized, suspended in MEB (150 mM mannitol, 10 mM HEPES, 50
mM KCl, 5 mM succinate, 20 μM EGTA, 20 μM EGTA, 0.1% protease-free BSA, pH 7.5 +/
− 0.1), and 1-2×104 cells were added in 15 μL of MEB to each well of a 384 well Fluotrac
200 plate containing 15 μL/well of either peptides at 2X final concentration, buffer only, or
50 μM alamethicin in MEB supplemented with 2μ JC-1, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20
μg/mL oligomycin, and 50 μg/mL digitonin. Fluorescence at Em 590 +/− nm and Ex 545 +/
− 10 nm was recorded at 5 min intervals at 32°C. The area under each curve was normalized
to the alamethicin and buffer controls as:

% Depolarization = 1- [(AUC sample – AUC alamethicin) / (AUC buffer – AUC alamethicin)].
Delta priming was calculated per peptide treatment as: Delta Priming = (Depolarization
Treated) – (Depolarization Untreated). Positive delta priming indicates an increase in
priming due to treatment and an increased potential for apoptosis at later time points.

Antibodies used for immunofluorescence were CK18 (Dako, M7010), CK17 (Dako,
M7046), HMW CK (Dako, M0630), LMW CK (Dako, M0631), CD44 (NeoMarkers,
MS-668-P1), CD24 (NeoMarkers, MS-1279-P1), p-STAT3 (Cell Signaling, 9145S), VIM
(Dako, M073501), CDH1 (BD Biosciences, 610181), FLAG (Sigma, F1804), BrdU (Roche,
11170376001), pBRD4 (a gift from Dr. Chiang at University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center), and AR (Cell Signaling, 5153S). Immunofluorescence experiments were performed
in cultured cells or in whole sections of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) xenograft
29
tumors. The staining was performed as described . Antibody dilutions were as follows: pSTAT3 (1:25), CD44 (1:100), CD24 (1:100), CK18 (1:200), CK17 (1:200), HMW CK
(1:100), LMW CK (1:100), VIM (1:100), CDH1 (1:100), FLAG (1:50), BrdU (1:200),
pBRD4 (1:200), and AR (1:50). The Dana-Farber Breast Cancer Tissue Microarray (TMA)
consists of primary TNBC samples from approximately 83 patients who underwent
definitive breast surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital between 1/1/1997 to 12/31/2005.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancers were collected from the archives of the

coring were identified and selected by a breast pathologist (DD) to represent different area
of the tumor. Results of immunohistochemical studies for estrogen (ER) and progesterone
receptor (PR) and HER2 and FISH assay results for HER2 were extracted from pathology
reports. TMA construction was carried out in the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Tissue
Microarray Core Facility. Three 0.6 mm cores were taken from different marked areas in
each case and placed into a recipient block using a manual arrayer (Beecher Instruments).
Specimens are arrayed in triplicate. Participants signed consent for research use of tissue and
the linking of tumor specimens to clinical follow-up. Clinical data on these patients was
collected retrospectively at first presentation, at 4, 9, 18, 30, and 42 months, and annually
thereafter. After 9.3 years median follow up, 24 recurrences and 14 deaths have been
recorded. The data elements are the following: staging, tumor pathology, diagnostic and
follow-up tests performed, treatments administered (surgery, radiation and systemic
therapy), and recurrence. Although the patients in this cohort were not treated as part of a
clinical trial protocol, they were treated relatively uniformly as per Dana-Farber clinical
practice guidelines. This serves to minimize confounding due to treatment heterogeneity.
The TMA was stained with pBRD4 (1:200) antibody and imaged manually on Yokagawa
spinning disc confocal microscope. Three images were taken per each core for 240 out of
267 cores, for the remaining 27 one or two images were taken due to tissue loss or low
tumor content. Image analysis was performed with ImageJ software macro (code available
upon request). Phospho-BRD4 staining mean intensity was calculated per individual nucleus
within an image. The mean intensity per image was normalized to nuclei count. For clinical
outcome analysis patients were dichotomized as ‘High’/’Low’ pBRD4 by median intensity
(Supplementary Table 9). Disease outcomes were evaluated in 83 of 89 TMA samples (3
were not TNBC by definitive pathology, 2 did not have clinical data available, one was a
repeat biopsy on a patient). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined as the interval from
the date of initial surgical resection to the date of recurrence (local or distant), or date of last
known contact if the patient was alive and has not recurred. RFS and overall survival were
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method, with hazard ratios and 95%
confidence intervals from a univariate Cox proportional hazard model.
siRNAs and lentiviral shRNA and expression constructs

Author Manuscript

For siRNA transfection cells were plated at 2,000 cells per well in 96-well plates and
cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in the media. The next day, cells were transfected in triplicate
with siGENOME SMARTpools for the genes of interest or “Non-Targeting siRNA” controls
using DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon). The sequences of the siRNAs in the SMARTpools are
listed in Supplementary Table 10. Cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo
(Promega) three days after transfections, with the effects of each siRNAs treatment on each
cell line compared to the effects of no siRNAs.
TET-inducible pLKO-TET-ON lentiviral constructs were packaged by co-transfection of the
lentiviral hairpin containing plasmid PLKO.1 and the helper plasmids pCMV-dR8.91 and
pMD2.G-VS.V-G into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamin (Life Technolgies). Following
transduction via spinoculation for 30 min hr at 1000 g and selection with 1 μg/ml puromycin
for 72 hr (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), knockdown efficacy was determined by western blotting

Cells were lysed five days after transfection with siRNAs in RIPA buffer. Proteins were
resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4%–12%) and transferred to PVDF membranes by
using a Tris-glycine buffer system. Membranes were blocked with 5%milk powder in 0.1%
Tween20 in PBS (PBS-T) for 1 hr at room temperature followed by incubation with primary
antibodies at 1:1000 dilution in 2.5% milk PBS-T. For immunoprecipitation, nuclear extracts
were prepared as follow: 10× 106cells were resupended in 5ml Buffer A: 10mM Tris pH 7.9,
1.5mM MgCl2, 10mM KCl, 0.05% NP-40, 1mM DTT, and protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and gently vortexed every 5 min. After
centrifugation at 2,000g for 5 min, pellets were suspended in 0.3 ml buffer B (20mM Tris
pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5mM MgCl2, 1mM KCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.2mM EDTA,
1mM DTT, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated for 5 min on ice. After
centrifugation of the lysates at 14g for 10 min at 4°C, supernatant was diluted with 0.6 ml
buffer A, and added NP-40 to final 0.5% and treated with DNase I. The samples were then
incubated at 4°C overnight with BRD4 or Flag antibodies at 1:100 dilution and
immunoprecipitates were collected on Dynabeads Protein G for 2 hr. Beads were washed
with buffer B containing 150mM NaCl and 0.5% NP-40 three times and then resuspended in
gel loading buffer. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated 2-3
times.

SILAC-RIME Experiments and data analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

SUM159 and SUM159R cells were grown in R/K-deficient SILAC DMEM (paa; E15-086),
10% dialyzed serum (Sigma-Aldrich; F0392), and supplemented with 800 μM LLysine 13C615N2Hydrochloride and 482 μM L-Arginine13C615N4 hydrochloride (Cambridge
Isotope lab) for “heavy”-labeled media or 800 μM L-Lysine 12C614N2-Hydrochloride and
482 μM L-Arginine 12C614N4 hydrochloride for “light”-labeled media. After SILAC
20
labeling, RIME was performed as described . Word clouds for Fig. 5a were generated using
R version 3.1.0 and the R package “wordcloud” version 2.5. The size of the tag reflects the
square root of the MASCOT score of the protein (the choice of square root is arbitrary, but
visually appealing). Experiments were filtered against the Contaminant Repository for
30
Affinity Purification Mass Spectrometry Data , considering any protein which occurs in at
least 20 negative control experiments to be contamination, hence removed from the data set.
Refseq protein IDs provided by the contaminant repository were converted to Uniprot IDs
found in the mass spec experiments using mappings from the Bioconductor package
“org.Hs.eg.db”, version 2.14 (Carlson M. org.Hs.eg.db: Genome wide annotation for
Human. R package version 3.0.0). SILAC RIME experiments were performed in duplicates
and repeated 2-3 times.
In vitro Chem-seq, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq

Chem-seq was performed essentially as described . ChIP-seq: SUM159 and SUM159R
cells (4×107) were grown in SUM Medium. The media were then removed and replaced
with media containing 1% formaldehyde (EM grade; tebu-bio) and crosslinked for 8 min.
Crosslinking was quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.2 M. The cells
were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested in PBS, and the cell pellet was washed with PBS.
The nuclear fraction was extracted by first resuspending the pellet in 10 ml of LB1 buffer
(50mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.5], 140mMNaCl, 1mMEDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40 or
Igepal CA-630, and 0.25% Triton X-100) for 10 min at 4°C. Cells were pelleted,
resuspended in 10 ml of LB2 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL [pH 8.0], 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, and 0.5 mM EGTA), and mixed for 5 min. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in
300 μl of LB3 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM
EGTA, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, and 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine) and sonicated in a covaris
sonicator for 10 min. A total of 30 μl of 10% Triton X-100 was added, and lysate was
centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 rcf to purify the debris. The supernatant was then incubated
with 100 μl of magnetic beads (Life Technologies) prebound with 20 μg BRD4 antibody
(Bethyl, A301-985A), and immunoprecipitation (IP) was conducted overnight in the cold
room. The beads were washed ten times in 1 ml of RIPA buffer and twice in 100mM
ammonium hydrogen carbonate (AMBIC) solution. DNA was eluted in elution buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS). Cross-links were reversed overnight at
65°C. RNA and protein were digested with 0.2 mg/mL RNase A for 2 hr followed by 0.2
mg/mL Proteinase K for 1 hr. DNA was purified with phenol chloroform extraction and
ethanol precipitation. Libraries for Illumina sequencing were prepared following the
Rubicon ThruPLEX-FD kit for 10-12 cycles.
RNA-seq: SUM159 and SUM159R were incubated in biological duplicates for 3, 12 and 24
hr with 500 nM of JQ1 or DMSO treatment. Total RNA was extracted using the standard

Illumina igenomes NCBI37/HG19 UCSC transcriptome build retrieved from http://
ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/igenomes.shtml. Alignments were performed using default
32
parameters. Transcript expression quantification was performed using Cufflinks (version
2.2.0) with default parameters to generate gene expression values in units of FPKM.

ChIP-seq and Chem-seq data processing—All ChIP-seq and Chem-seq datasets
33
were aligned using Bowtie2 (version 2.2.1) to build version NCBI37/HG19 of the human
genome or build version NCB37/MM9 of the mouse genome. Alignments were performed
using the following criteria: -k 1, with all other parameters set to default. These criteria
preserved only reads that mapped uniquely to the genome without any mismatches.
Calculating read density—We calculated the normalized read density of a ChIP-seq or
Chem-seq dataset in any region using the Bamliquidator (version 0.9) read density calculator
(https://github.com/BradnerLab/pipeline/wiki/bamliquidator). Briefly, ChIP-Seq reads
aligning to the region were extended by 200bp and the density of reads per basepair (bp) was
calculated. The density of reads in each region was normalized to the total number of million
mapped reads producing read density in units of reads per million mapped reads per bp
(rpm/bp).

Identifying ChIP-seq and Chem-seq enriched regions—We used the MACS
34
version 1.4.2 (Model based analysis of ChIP-Seq) peak finding algorithm to identify
regions of ChIP-Seq enrichment over background. A p-value threshold of enrichment of
1e-9 was used for all datasets. The GEO accession number and background used for each
dataset can be found in the accompanying Supplementary Table 2.
Creating heatmap representations of ChIP-seq occupancy—Heatmaps of ChIP35
seq occupancy for various factors were created as described . Heatmaps were created for
the +/− 10kb region flanking all transcription start sites (TSS) or for the +/−10kb region
flanking all TSS distal BET bromodomain bound enhancers. Each row plots a specific TSS

or enhancer region. Rows are ranked by peak occupancy of BET bromodomains as
determined by Bio-JQ1 Chem-seq signal (Fig. 1d).
Correlating BRD4 and H3K27ac occupancy to Bio-JQ1—Occupancy of BRD4 and
H3K27ac was correlated to Bio-JQ1 occupancy at all regions of Bio-JQ1 enrichment in
SUM159 cells. Pearson correlation statistics are shown (Extended Data Fig. 3a). To quantify
changes in BRD4 or H3K27ac occupancy upon JQ1 treatment, all Bio-JQ1 enriched regions
were ranked in SUM159 cells and then binned (n=10). Corresponding boxplots of BRD4 or
H3K27ac log2 fold change +/− JQ1 are shown for each bin (Extended Data Fig. 3b).

Mapping enhancers and super-enhancers using Bio-JQ1 occupancy or BRD4
—Enhancers and super enhancers (SEs) were mapped using the ROSE software package
12 13
described , and available at (younglab.wi.mit.edu/super_enhancer_code.html). In
SUM159 and SUM159R cells, Bio-JQ1 Chem-Seq enriched regions were used to map
enhancers and SEs (Fig. 1f). In SUM149 cells, BRD4 ChIP-seq enriched regions were used
to map enhancers and SEs (Extended Data Fig. 3). Enhancers are defined as regions of BioJQ1 binding not contained in promoters.

Author Manuscript

Quantifying changes in gene expression of SE proximal genes—Genes within
50kb of SE in SUM159 or SUM149 were identified and filtered for expression status (> 1
FPKM expression in any sample), and filtered to remove non poly-adenylated transcripts
(e.g. microRNAs). For SUM159, log2 fold changes in gene expression at SE associated
genes or all expressed genes was compared at 3, 12, and 24 hours post JQ1 treatment (Fig.
1g). For SUM149, comparisons were made at 12 hours post JQ1 treatment (Extended Data
Fig. 3f). The statistical significance of differences between distributions of changes was also
assessed using a Welch's two-tailed t test.
Identifying differentially expressed genes upon JQ1 treatment—To identify
genes differentially regulated by JQ1 treatment in SUM159 or SUM149 cells, all genes with
a > log2 fold change in expression were ordered by fold change at 24 hours +/− JQ1 for
SUM159 or at 12 hours +/− JQ1 for SUM149. The log2 row median normalized fold change
for each gene is displayed as a heatmap in Extended Data Fig. 3g for SUM159 and in
Extended Data Fig. 3h for SUM149. For subsequent gene set and pathway analysis,
SUM159 genes with consistent and statistically significantly altered expression were
selected using a Welch's two-tailed t test between DMSO and JQ1 treated expression values
at 12 and 24 hours. A p-value cutoff of 0.01 was applied (Extended Data Fig. 3k).

Identifying gained/lost SE between SUM159 and SUM159R—SE differential
36
regions were defined as in Brown et al. 2014 . Briefly, in order to quantify changes in
super-enhancers between two conditions, background subtracted ChIP-Seq signal was
calculated at the set of all enhancer regions considered super in at least one condition.
Gained/lost super-enhancers were determined as those with a greater than log2 fold change
signal in either direction. The log2 fold change in Bio-JQ1 occupancy at all rank ordered SE
containing regions is shown in Fig. 2c. SE regions were classified as either gained,
conserved, or lost. Gained/lost regions were classified as those with > 1 log2 fold change in
either direction. Conserved regions were classified as those with < 0.25 log2 fold change in

gene expression is shown in Extended Data Fig. 5d-f.
Quantifying changes in BRD4 and H3K27ac occupancy upon JQ1 treatment in
either SUM159 or SUM159R cells at Bio-JQ1 regions—Log2 fold changes in BRD4
or H3K27ac were quantified at Bio-JQ1 enriched regions in their respective cell line and
shown in Extended Data Fig. 5c.
Quantifying changes in BRD4 and H3K27ac as a function of Bio-JQ1 or BRD4
occupancy—Bio-JQ1 enriched regions in SUM159 or BRD4 enriched regions in SUM149
were ranked by increasing levels and then distributed into 10 bins. Log2 fold changes in
BRD4 or H3K27ac were quantified in each bin of regions and displayed as a box plot
(Extended Data Fig. 3b,c).
