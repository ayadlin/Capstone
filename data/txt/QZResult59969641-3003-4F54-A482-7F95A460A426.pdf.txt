ABSTRACT
The bromodomain (BRD) and extraterminal (BET) proteins including BRD2, BRD3
and BRD4 have been identified as key targets for leukemia maintenance. A novel
oral inhibitor of BRD2/3/4, the thienotriazolodiazepine compound OTX015, suitable
for human use, is available. Here we report its biological effects in AML and ALL cell
lines and leukemic samples. Exposure to OTX015 lead to cell growth inhibition, cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis at submicromolar concentrations in acute leukemia cell
lines and patient-derived leukemic cells, as described with the canonical JQ1 BET
inhibitor. Treatment with JQ1 and OTX15 induces similar gene expression profiles
in sensitive cell lines, including a c-MYC decrease and an HEXIM1 increase. OTX015
exposure also induced a strong decrease of BRD2, BRD4 and c-MYC and increase of
HEXIM1 proteins, while BRD3 expression was unchanged. c-MYC, BRD2, BRD3, BRD4
and HEXIM1 mRNA levels did not correlate however with viability following exposure
to OTX015. Sequential combinations of OTX015 with other epigenetic modifying
drugs, panobinostat and azacitidine have a synergic effect on growth of the KASUMI
cell line. Our results indicate that OTX015 and JQ1 have similar biological effects in
leukemic cells, supporting OTX015 evaluation in a Phase Ib trial in relapsed/refractory
leukemia patients.

and extraterminal (BET) protein family, including
bromodomain-containing proteins BRD2, BRD3 and
BRD4, in the maintenance of aberrant chromatin states in
AML, ALL, myeloma and lymphoma [2], [3], [4], [5].
BRD2/3/4 activate transcription by binding to
acetyl-modified lysine residues of histone tails [6].
As chromatin scaffolds, they recruit elements of the
positive transcriptional elongation factor b (P-TEFb)
complexes to RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and
initiate transcriptional elongation [7], [8]. Physiologically,
P-TEFb-mediated elongation is regulated by the dynamic
interplay of BRD4 and hexamethylene bisacetamide
(HMBA) inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) [9], [10]. BRD4
recruits P-TEFb to active promoters via its affinity
to acetylated histones, while HEXIM1 inactivates
P-TEFb via conformational changes and interaction of
its C-terminal domain with 7SK snRNA [11]. In mice,
c-MYC, a key regulator of cellular proliferation with
oncogenic activity, has been shown to regulate P-TEFbdependent pause release of Pol II [12].
BRD4 has been shown to drive oncogenetic
processes by various mechanisms. The fusion protein
BRD4-NUT is responsible for the aggressive NUT
midline carcinoma [13], while interaction of BRD4 with
acetylated NF-𝜅B/RelA leads to constitutively active NF-𝜅
B, enhancing cancer cell proliferation [14]. BRD4 also
directly interacts with NPM1, MDM2 and p53 proteins,
notably via HEXIM1. Wild type NPM1 represses BRD4
by reducing its affinity to chromatin. This negative
regulation is impaired in NPM1-mutated AML [15], [16].
Knockdown of BRD4 in a shRNA screen demonstrated its
critical role for maintenance of AML, as BRD4 inhibition
resulted in antileukemic activity in vitro and in vivo [2],
[17]. BRD2 associates with transcriptional coactivators
and corepressors, regulates expression of cyclin A and
D1, and acts as an atypical kinase with intrinsic chaperone
activity [18]. Overexpression of BRD2 in murine B-cell
progenitors induces a B-cell malignancy whose proteomic
signature is reminiscent of human diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma [19].
Inhibition of BET proteins thus constitutes an
attractive therapeutic target. Pharmacologic BET inhibitors
in development display significant activity in hematologic
malignancies [20]. Treatment with the benzodiazepinederived inhibitor JQ1 recapitulated anti-leukemic effects
of shRNA-induced suppression of BRD4 in several AML
cell lines, mouse models and primary patient samples
[2], and has also been associated with potent cell growth
inhibition, cell cycle arrest and cell senescence, and
decrease of c-MYC in three murine multiple myeloma
cell lines [4]. The small molecule BET protein inhibitors
I-BET151 and I-BET762, belonging to the quinoline class
of BET inhibitors, have also demonstrated in vitro activity
in hematologic malignancies, including mixed lineage
leukemia-related AML and multiple myeloma [21], [22].
BET inhibition by these agents results in preferential loss
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of BRD4 bound to super-enhancers and by consequence
causes transcriptional repression of c-MYC [23].
OTX015, a thienotriazolodiazepine compound
and a JQ1 analog, has been shown to inhibit binding of
BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 to acetylated histone 4 in a
concentration-dependent manner, suggesting competitive
inhibition, with IC50 values from 92-112nM (Kay Noel,
American association for Cancer Research, AACRNCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular
Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, Boston, MA, USA, oral
communication, Oct 22, 2013). Here we studied the effects
of OTX015 in a panel of leukemia cell lines, including the
drug effects on cell growth , apoptosis and the expression
of genes involved in the BRD2/3/4 signaling pathway.
OTX015 was also evaluated ex vivo using primary cell
samples from selected patients. OTX015 has entered
clinical development in leukemia, with early results of an
ongoing phase Ib study in advanced hematological tumors
now available (Patrice Herait, AACR Annual Meeting,
San Diego, LA, USA; Oral communication, Apr 04, 2014).

RESULTS
Effect of OTX015 on cell proliferation, cell cycle
and apoptosis in leukemia cell lines
Cellular effects of OTX015 in various acute
leukemia subtypes were evaluated. Cell viability after
OTX015 exposure was assessed with the MTT assay in
nine AML and four ALL cell lines. Significant growth
inhibition, defined as a submicromolar IC50, was found
in six of nine AML cell lines and all four ALL cell lines
tested (Table 1). The K562 and KG1a AML cell lines were
resistant to OTX015.
The effect of 500nM OTX015 exposure for 48h on
the cell cycle resulted in decreased transition from G1 to
S-phase in all 13 cell lines and a significant increase in
cells in the sub-G1 phase in KG1a, KG1, HEL, KASUMI
and JURKAT cell lines (Figure 1A, 1B and supplementary
Figure 1).
Treatment with OTX015 at doses from 25 to 500nM
for 72h induced significant apoptosis, as detected by
Annexin V staining and PI uptake. At 500nM OTX015,
30-90% of cells were apoptotic in five of nine AML cell
lines (HEL, NB4, NOMO-1, OCI-AML3, KASUMI) and
50-90% in two of four ALL cell lines (JURKAT and RS411; Figure 1C). Finally, 72h exposure to 500nM OTX015
induced mitochondrial apoptosis by cytochrome c release
and caspase-3 activation (Figure 1D).

Thirteen AML and ALL cell lines were exposed to OTX015 (0.01 nM to 10 µM). Cell proliferation was measured by the
MTT assay at 72h and IC50 values were estimated. Experiments were performed in quadruplicates and means from three
independent experiments are reported.

Gene expression profiling of leukemic cell lines
upon treatment with OTX015 and JQ1

Effects of OTX015 on c-MYC, BRD2/3/4 and
HEXIM1 in acute leukemia cell lines

The patterns of gene expression after treatment with
500nM OTX015 and 500nM JQ1 for 24h were similar for
both drugs compared to controls (Figure 2A). Applying
a cutoff of 1e-3 for the FDR and a cutoff of 0.9 for the
log-fold-change in both comparisons, yielded signatures
of 29 and 39 genes in the OTX015 vs. DMSO and the
JQ1 vs. DMSO comparisons respectively. Among those
genes, 27 were common to both signatures (Figure 2A,
using a Fisher’s exact test, the hypothesis of independence
of both signatures was rejected; p = 2.2e-16). In cell
lines (NOMO1, OCI-AML3, HL60, KG1a and K562),
molecular signatures of OTX015 treatment were similar
for the sensitive HL60, NOMO-1 and OCI-AML3 cell
lines, including decrease or increase of c-MYC and
HEXIM1 expression (Figure 2B), whereas somewhat
different expression patterns were noted for the less
sensitive KG1a, and the resistant K562 cell lines.
Gene set enrichment analysis was performed for
OTX015 or JQ1 vs. DMSO differential expression using
the Gene Ontology Biological Process database (n =
794 genes). Similar enrichment in a representative MYC
dependent gene set [24] and a representative cell cycle
gene set (Biological process GO:0007079) [25] were
observed in all cell lines for OTX015 and JQ1 respectively
(Figure 2C and 2D).

Based on the results of the expression arrays
experiments, we first evaluated the effects on c-MYC
protein and mRNA expression after exposure to OTX015
at 500nM for 4, 24, 48 or 72h of in a panel of AL cell
lines. Basal c-MYC gene expression varied among cell
lines, with lowest levels observed in BCR-ABL+ K562
cells and highest levels observed in the PML-RARα
rearranged NB4 cell line (Figure 3A). Following exposure
to OTX015, c-MYC protein and mRNA expression was
analyzed. We observed a c-MYC protein decrease to a
variable extent as early as 24h after treatment in all cell
lines tested, including AML cell lines (NPM1-mutated
OCI-AML3, BCR-ABL+ K562, PML-RARα-rearranged
NB4, MLL-AF9 fused NOMO1 and NRAS-driven HL60),
and ALL cell lines (T-ALL JURKAT and MLL-AF4 fused
B-ALL RS4-11 cells) (Figure 3B, supplementary Figure
2A). In line with these results, c-MYC mRNA decreased
ubiquitously after 4h and 24h OTX015 exposure in these
cell lines as well as in the OP2-FGFR1 rearranged KG1
AML cell line (Figure 3C). Treatment of these cell lines
with 500nM JQ1 induced a decrease in c-MYC protein as
seen with OTX015 at 24, 48 and 72h, as well as a similar
c-MYC mRNA decrease at 48h in all cell lines tested
(supplementary Figure 2B and 2C, respectively).
We also studied the effects of OTX015 exposure
on gene and protein expression of BRDs. Among AML
cell lines, basal gene expression levels of BRDs were
lowest in the BCR-ABL+ K562 cell line and highest in

PML-RARα rearranged NB4 (Figure 3D). After exposure
to 500nM OTX015 for 48h BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4
mRNA expression strongly decreased in the K562 and
NB4 cell lines but increased in HL60 and NOMO-1
cells (Figure 3E). Only mild variations of BRD2, BRD3
and BRD4 mRNA expression were observed in KG1,
OCI-AML3, JURKAT, BV-173 and RS4-11. OTX015
induced a decrease in BRD2 protein in most cell lines,
including OCI-AML3, JURKAT RS4-11, NB4, NOMO1 and HL60 cells but not in K562 cells (Figure 3B and
supplementary Figure 2A). In contrast, decreased BRD4
protein after OTX015 treatment was only seen in the OCIAML3, NB4 and K562 cell lines. Finally, BRD3 protein
levels were unmodified after OTX015 exposure in all
cell lines analyzed (Figure 3B and supplementary Figure
2A). Compared to OTX015, treatment with JQ1 induced
similar variations of BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 proteins

(supplementary Figure 2B).
The effect of OTX015 on HEXIM1 expression
was evaluated. HEXIM1 mRNA expression increased
both after 4 and 24h OTX015 exposure at 500nM in all
cell lines tested (K562, HL-60, NB4, NOMO-1, KG1,
OCI-AML3, JURKAT and RS4-11; Figure 3F). and was
highest in OCI-AML3 and RS4-11 cell lines. Treatment
with either OTX015 or JQ1 at 500nM (24-72h) yielded a
similar increase in HEXIM1 protein levels after 24, 48 and
72h in OCI-AML3, JURKAT and RS4-11 cell lines but
not in K562 cells (Figure 3B and supplementary Figure
2A and 2B).
Finally, basal mRNA expression levels of c-MYC,
BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and HEXIM1 did not significantly
correlate with OTX015-induced loss of viability in any
of the AML or ALL cell lines analyzed (supplementary
Figure 3).

Ex vivo effects of OTX015 in leukemic patientderived samples

observed in cell lines, gene expression levels were highly
variable across AML and ALL subtypes with the lowest
expression in bcr-abl rearranged ALL samples (Figure 4E,
supplementary Figure 5 and Table 2).

Apoptosis, mRNA and protein expression were
evaluated in BM mononuclear cells obtained from
representative newly diagnosed or relapsed ALL and
AML patients for whom sufficient material for analysis
was available (Table 2). Apoptosis induction by exposure
to 500nM OTX015 for 72h was variable among the
patient samples tested (Figure 4A). BM cells from 8 of 14
AML patients showed increased apoptosis ranging from
35-90% with OTX015 compared to control-treated cells
(patients 3, 15, 17, 26, 27, 28, 31 and 38), while no or
a mild increase in apoptosis was observed after OTX015
exposure in 6 of 14 patients (patients 4, 8, 9, 14, 16 and
18). BM cells from the two ALL patients tested showed no
or a mild increase in apoptosis (patients 40 and 43).
We obtained CD34+ cells from six healthy donors.
Apoptosis was assessed after 72h and OTX015 induced
no significant apoptosis after 72h exposure in cells
from 2 donors, while slight apoptosis was observed in 1
donor (supplementary Figure 4A). Clonogenicity assays
showed no significant inhibition of colony growth for 2
patients while colony growth was inhibited in 1 patient
(supplementary Figure 4B).
In line with our observations in cell lines, OTX015
also induced activation of caspase-3 and mitochondrial
cytochrome c release in samples analyzed from three AML
patients (Figure 4B).
After treatment with 500nM OTX015 for 48h,
c-MYC mRNA decreased in the seven AML samples and
two ALL samples (Figure 4C) evaluated. In three primary
AML samples analyzed, c-MYC protein clearly decreased
after 72h with 500nM OTX015, as did BRD2 protein

Simultaneous and sequential treatment of
KASUMI cell line with OTX015, azacitidine and
panobinostat
We searched for synergistic effects of OTX015
on growth (7-600nM) if combined to other epigenetic
modifying drugs: either azacitidine (123nM-10µM)
or panobinostat (0.1-10nM). Synergy, was observed
with both, simultaneous treatment of KASUMI cells
by OTX015 and azacitidine (CI: 0.89) and sequential
treatments, either OTX015 followed by azacitidine
(CI: 0.76) or azacitidine followed by OTX015 (CI:
0.68) (Figure 5A). Synergy was significantly stronger
when azacitidine was followed by OTX015 compared
to simultaneous treatment with both drugs (p = 0.03).
Significantly stronger synergy was observed during
sequential treatments with either OTX015 followed by
panobinostat or panobinostat followed by OTX015 (CI:
0.83 and 0.78 respectively) compared to simultaneous
treatment (CI: 0.93; p = 0.0001 and 0.01 respectively)
(Figure 5B).

DISCUSSION
Treatment of acute leukemia remains a major
clinical challenge, with disappointing long-term outcome
of the majority of adult patients. AML is predominantly
a disease of older patients, with overall survival of less
than 10-20% in this age group [26]. Novel treatment
strategies with acceptable toxicity are urgently needed
to improve outcome. Here we demonstrate for the first
time, that the oral BRD2/3/4 inhibitor OTX015, which is

already in early clinical development in acute leukemia
patients, has similar biological effects compared to JQ1,
a prototypic BRD inhibitor, although restricted to in
vitro use, in a broad range of acute leukemia cell lines
and patient-derived leukemic samples. In most leukemic
cell lines, relevant biological effects were observed in the
submicromolar range with IC50 values and very similar
for OTX015 and JQ1 [2]. In line, we observed cell cycle
arrest in the G1/S transition and apoptosis rates as reported
for JQ1.
The concentration range for which most biologic
effects were observed can be achieved in vivo, as
demonstrated in patients currently treated by OTX015
in the ongoing phase Ib clinical trial in refractory
hematologic malignancies, in which promising antitumor
activity has been seen in both leukemia and lymphoma
patients (Patrice Herait, AACR Annual Meeting, San
Diego, LA, USA; Oral communication, Apr 04, 2014).
Available pharmacokinetics data indicate that this activity
was detected with an OTX015 dosing and schedule giving
plasma trough levels of approximately 250nM.
In line with reported outcomes for BET inhibitors
JQ1 and I-BET in acute leukemia and other hematologic
malignancies [2], [4], OTX015 also decreased c-MYC
mRNA or protein as shown in the majority of the cell
lines, as well as in primary acute leukemia samples. These
observations confirm that c-MYC decrease is a major class
effect of these drugs. A recent publication also confirmed
that MYC is a key downstream target of BRD4-NUT
[27], associated with an aggressive form of squamous cell
carcinoma.
We show here that OTX015 exposure decreases
BRD2 and BRD4 proteins, while BRD3 expression
remained unaffected. Indeed it has been shown that that
pharmacologic or shRNA inhibition of BRD4 protein
expression leads to similar biologic effects [2]. More
recently, inhibition of BRD2 by siRNA knockdown or
treatment with JQ1 was shown to inhibit constitutive
STAT5 activity in a large panel of acute leukemia
and lymphoma cell lines [26]. In particular, strong
synergy towards induced apoptosis was described when
combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It has also
been demonstrated that the BET inhibitors I-BET151 and
I-BET762 (currently under clinical investigation in NUTmidline carcinoma) exert their biologic activity via BRD2
decrease [20]. Our findings with OTX015 also suggest that
BRD2 decrease participates in the anti-leukemic activity
of OTX015. Further studies are needed to dissect the roles
of BRD2 and BRD4 in OTX015 biologic effects [28].
Exposure to OTX015 or JQ1 increases HEXIM1
protein and mRNA expression [10]. Our findings of
increased HEXIM1 gene expression after treatment
with OTX015 are in line with those reported with either
JQ1 or I-BET151, in multiple myeloma and ALL [3],
[4], [22]. Overexpression of HEXIM1 leads to limited
availability of active P-TEFb as a result of sustained BET
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibition in myeloma cells having a significant impact
on the transcription of a large number of genes, including
oncogenic MYC [29]. In line, OTX015 induced HEXIM1
overexpression may similarly intervene in the effects we
observed in AL cell lines and AML patient samples.

OTX015 exposure induced growth inhibition,
blocked cell cycle G1-S transition and caused apoptosis
in acute leukemia cell lines and patient-derived leukemic
samples, as previously reported for other preclinical BET
inhibitors including JQ1 and I-BET151 [21], [30]. MLL
fusion is associated with the BET family of acetyl-lysine
recognizing chromatin adaptor proteins [21]. Similar to
previous reports of BET inhibitors being highly active in
MLL-fused leukemic cells, we show here that the MLL
gene-rearranged NOMO-1 and RS4-11 leukemia cell
lines are particularly sensitive to OTX015 [2], [3], [21],
[31]. The NPM1-mutated cell line OCI-AML3 was also
highly sensitive to OTX015, confirming results reported
by Dawson et al [16] showing efficacy of I-BET151 in this
cell line, as well as in a murine model of NPM1-mutated
AML and in primary patient samples harboring NPM1
mutations.
Interestingly, we were unable to identify any
correlations between reductions of cell viability or
induction of apoptosis and c-MYC, BRD2/3/4 and
HEXIM1 expression levels in cell lines exposed to
OTX015 (supplementary Figure 3). c-MYC decrease and
HEXIM1 increase induced by OTX015 was observed in
all the cell lines analyzed, as reported with other BET
inhibitors (supplementary Figure 6) .
Recently, elegant studies in mouse models have
shown that BET inhibition specifically targets recurrent
genetic lesions in AML including IDH2 and FLT3-ITD
mutations, complete or interstitial chromosome 7 deletion,
and inv(3)/t(3;3) associated with aberrant EVI1 expression
[32], [33], [34]. Importantly, all of these genetic lesions
are associated with a poor prognosis in patients treated
with standard chemotherapy regimens [35]. BET
inhibition has also been reported to target chemoresistant,
‘persister’ cells in T-ALL [36]. Thus, OTX015 might
also be a promising therapeutic option for this subset of
chemoresistant acute leukemia subtypes.
Epigenetic
modifying
drugs
like
the
hypomethylating agent azacitidine and the histone
deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat hold promise in the
treatment of patients with AML uneligible for intensive
treatment [37]. Furthermore it has recently been shown
that targeting histone deacetylases in t(8;21) AML
constitutes a potential molecular target [38]. In line, we
have tested combinations of OTX015 with azacitidine
and panobinostat in the t(8;21) KASUMI AML cell line.
Simultaneous treatments mostly lead to additive effects
while a strong synergy was observed with a sequential
treatment with azacitidine followed by OTX015.
This confirms earlier observations of synergic effects
of combinations of the BET inhibitor JQ1 and AML
chemotherapy (i.e.Cytarabine) [30] .
On the other hand, to date, no mechanisms leading
to resistance of BET inhibition have been identified. BCRABL driven K562 was the only cell line to be clearly
resistant, but BCR-ABL T-ALL cell lines BV-173 and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

TOM-1 were highly sensitive to OTX015 treatment, which
hints to other resistance mechanisms in K562 cells. Of
note, the anti apoptotic gene BCL2 was among the top ten
of up-regulated genes in K562 cells as compared to OCIAML 3 cells upon treatment with OTX015, indicating
that up-regulation of anti apoptotic pathways could be
implicated in resistance of K562 cells (supplementary
Table 2). Nevertheless, somewhat different expression
patterns for resistant K562 and less sensitive KG1a cells
compared to other more sensitive cell lines were observed.
We have demonstrated that the BET inhibitor
OTX015 decreases the expression of BRD2, BRD4 and
c-MYC and increases the expression of the MYC negative
regulator HEXIM1 as the BET-inhibitor JQ1 probe. Our
data comfort the use of OTX015 in the ongoing phase
1b clinical trial in refractory hematologic malignancies
including acute leukemias, and future studies in this
indication.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and selection of primary patient cells
A panel of representative ALL and AML cell
lines was purchased from Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ). ALL cell

(4-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-1)
and panobinostat ([E]-N-hydroxy-3-4-((2-(2-methyl1H-indol-3-yl)ethylamino)methyl)phenyl)-acrylamide
were purchased from Selleckchem. All compounds were
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 1.0M stock
solution) and stored at -80°C. Aliquots were thawed and
used immediately for serial dilution in culture media.
Control cells were incubated with 0.1% DMSO.

Cells were allowed to adhere to polylysine-L slides
(Thermo Scientific) and analyzed using an Image-iT®
Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (Life Technologies). Briefly,
cells were fixed for 15 minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS (pH7.3) at room temperature, then permeabilized
with Triton X-100 0.5% for 15 minutes and blocked
for 1 hour with 3% BSA in DPBS (pH7.4). Cells were
incubated with cleaved caspase-3 antibody (rabbit
monoclonal Ab 9664; Cell Signaling Technology) or
cytochrome c antibody (mouse monoclonal Ab 556432;
Becton Dickinson) overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies
were goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG coupled
with Alexa 568 (red) or Alexa 488 (green) fluorochromes
(Life Technologies) incubated at 37°C for 2h. Nuclei were
counterstained with DAPI (Vector). Images were acquired
by immunofluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Axiovert
microscope with a Plan-Apochromat X63 N.A.1.4 oil
immersion objective using the Axiovison software v4.2
(Carl Zeiss).

MTT assay, apoptosis assessment and cell cycle
analysis
For the MTT assay, cells were seeded in 24well plates at 1x106 per well and treated with a range
of OTX015 concentrations 0.01nM-10μM for 72h.
Cells were transferred to 96-well plates and incubated
with
0.5mg/mL
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Molecular Probes) in
the dark at 37°C for 4h. Cells were then lysed with 25%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis buffer and absorbance
was read at 570nm using a Promega Microplate Reader.
Three independent experiments were run for each cell line
and untreated cells were used as negative controls. The
half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were
calculated with Prism® v6 software (GraphPad Inc).
For cell cycle analysis, 1x106 cells were treated with
a range of OTX015 concentrations 25-500nM for 48h
then harvested, washed in PBS, and fixed in 70% ice cold
ethanol. Cells were incubated with 100 µg/mL RNAse
(Sigma) and stained with 25 µg/mL propidium iodide (PI;
Becton Dickinson) for 30 minutes at 37°C.
For apoptosis analysis, 1x106 cells derived from
patients or cell lines were resuspended in 1 ml culture
medium and treated with OTX015 for 72h. Apoptotic
cells were detected using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson). Cells were stained with 5µg/mL PI
and Annexin-V-FITC (Becton Dickinson) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions for 15 minutes at room
temperature. Apoptotic cells were defined as Annexin V+
with or without PI uptake.
Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were
determined by cytofluorometric analysis using a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and
analyzed with the FlowJo flow cytometry software
(TreeStar Inc).

Quantitative-real time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-qPCR)
Total RNA after extraction with TRIzol (Invitrogen)
was titrated to 1μg/μL with a NanoDrop 2000c UV-Vis
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and stored at
-80°C. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized
from 1μg RNA with a reverse transcriptase M-MLV Kit®
(Life Technologies) using Random Hexamer Primers
(Thermo Scientific). RT-qPCR reactions (BRD2, BRD3,
BRD4, c-MYC, HEXIM1, GAPDH and ABL) were
performed in 25 µl from one- tenth of the cDNA volume
(100 ng RNA), using a thermocycler ABI7900HT (Life
Technologies) with TaqMan reagent or a StepOnePlus
(Life Technologies) with SYBR Green reagent (Roche)
in standard mode (1 cycle of 2 minutes at 50°C then 10
minutes at 95°C followed by 50 cycles of 15 seconds at
95°C then 1 minute at 60°C) with a supplementary melting
curve step for SYBR Green assays. Primers (Eurogentec)
are listed in supplementary Table 1. mRNA levels were
normalized to ABL control gene.

Gene expression profiling
NOMO-1, OCI-AML3, HL60, KG1a and K562
cells were treated for 24 hours either with 500nM
OTX015, 500nM JQ1 or 0.1% DMSO (vehicle). Total
RNA was extracted from corresponding cell lines.
