BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer trials investigating neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, followed by surgery, have
demonstrated that elimination of all tumor cells from the primary site is rare. The authors report a phase 2 trial
assessing the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel and gefitinib in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer as
neoadjuvant therapy before radical prostatectomy (RP). METHODS: Thirty-one patients with high-risk prostate
cancer were treated with docetaxel and gefitinib for 2 months before RP. All patients met the criteria of clinical
stage T2b-3 or serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level >20 ng/mL, or Gleason score of 8 to 10. The primary
endpoint was pathologic complete response. Secondary objectives included clinical response. When available,
endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI) was performed as part of clinical response evaluation. Immunohistochemical staining of epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2/neu was performed on prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy prostate tissue. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 60 years, the
median pretreatment PSA level was 7.43 ng/mL, and the median Gleason score was 8. Clinical staging prior
to treatment consisted of: T1 in 4 patients, T2 in 17 patients, and T3 in 10 patients. One patient with
enlarged pelvic adenopathy and T4 disease did not undergo RP. Thirty patients received all scheduled
therapies including RP. Grade 3 toxicities included asymptomatic liver function test elevation in 4 (13%)
patients, diarrhea in 1 (3%) patient, and fatigue in 1 (3%) patient. One patient experienced grade 4 toxicity
with elevated alanine aminotransferase. RP specimen pathology demonstrated residual carcinoma in all
cases. Twenty-nine (94%) patients achieved a clinical partial response, including 35% of patients who demonstrated radiographic improvement on eMRI. CONCLUSIONS: No pathologic complete response was
noted in 31 patients treated with docetaxel and gefitinib. This combination was well tolerated, and did not

Docetaxel and Gefitinib in Prostate CA/Vuky et al

Biochemical or clinical failure for patients with
high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer after radical
prostatectomy (RP) is estimated to be 50% to 90%
within 5 to 10 years after definitive surgical therapy
alone.1-3 Effective therapy for high-risk locally advanced
prostate cancer is needed. Trials investigating neoadjuvant hormonal or chemotherapy, followed by surgery,
demonstrate that the elimination of all tumor cells in
the primary site is rare.4-10 Prostate cancers demonstrate
heterogeneity, even in early stages of disease, for a variety of biomarkers, including platelet-derived growth factor, c-kit, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).11
The addition of novel targeted therapies, in combination with chemotherapy or alone, is a potentially promising approach to neoadjuvant therapy for high-risk
prostate cancer.
Members of the EGFR family have been identified as
potential drug targets that are differentially expressed on tumor cells after androgen ablation.11 Gefitinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR, has demonstrated
antiproliferative activity against prostate cancer cell lines.12
Docetaxel has shown efficacy and improvement in survival
in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, and the combination of taxane and gefitinib has produced regression in prostate cancer cell lines.13,14 We performed a phase 2 trial to
assess the pathologic complete response (pCR) in 29 evaluable patients using the combination of docetaxel and gefitinib as neoadjuvant therapy before RP in patients with highrisk prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between July 2003 and January 2006, 31 patients with
high-risk prostate cancer entered this phase 2 trial approved
by the institutional review board at Virginia Mason Medical
Center. Eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed
locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate; clinical
stage T2b-3 disease or a serum prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) 20 ng/mL, or a Gleason sum score of 8 to 10. In
addition, clinical T2 patients were eligible if endorectal coil
magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI) demonstrated T3 disease or a Gleason sum score of 4 þ 3 cancer in 5 biopsies
(with a minimum of 10 biopsies), informed consent, and
no evidence of metastatic disease confirmed with computed

(ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function (which included an
absolute granulocyte count 1500 cells/mm3, a platelet
count 100,000 cells/mm3, serum bilirubin within 1.5
the upper limit of normal [ULN], transaminase levels
2.5 ULN, and a serum creatinine 1.5 ULN) were
required for enrollment. Exclusion criteria included existing
peripheral neuropathy grade 1; concurrent or prior treatment with hormonal therapy (excluding finasteride for obstructive voiding symptoms), radiation, or biologic therapy
for prostate cancer; prior malignancy; and the concomitant
use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin,
or St. John’s wort. Patients unwilling to use effective means
of contraception were excluded; contraception was continued for 3 months after treatment.

Treatment Schedule
The dose and schedule of docetaxel and gefitinib in the current study was derived from lung cancer trials.15,16 Gefitinib
was supplied by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals (London,
England) as 250-mg–strength, film-coated tablets. The dose
of 250 mg/day was administered orally beginning the first
day of docetaxel chemotherapy. Docetaxel was administered
weekly at a dose of 36 mg/m2 over 1 hour with dexamethasone before and after chemotherapy. Premedication with
dexamethasone was given to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity
reactions. Dexamethasone at a dose of 4 mg orally was given
the night before, the morning of, and the evening after docetaxel administration. Docetaxel was given weekly for 3
weeks with 1 week off for 2 cycles, with 1 cycle constituting
28 days. Gefitinib was administered orally continuously for
56 days. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy was not provided,
given previous data demonstrating its limited role in this setting, and to clarify the influence of docetaxel and gefitinib
without confounding variables.

Dose Modifications and Supportive Care
Because docetaxel and gefitinib have different toxicities,
we judged which was the causative agent and reduced
accordingly. Toxicity was graded according to the
785

Original Article

National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria v.
3.0 grading system. In the case of hematologic toxicity,
grade 4 thrombocytopenia required a docetaxel dose reduction of 25%; if a patient experienced a grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, treatment was withheld until the toxicity was resolved
to grade 1 or less. No dose reductions were required for anemia. The routine use of granulocyte–colony–stimulating
factor (GCSF) was not allowed. In patients who experienced
neutropenic fever, the use of GCSF was allowed, and used at
the discretion of the investigator. No patients required the
use of GCSF or erythropoietin-a.
Liver function tests (LFTs) were evaluated every
week while patients were receiving chemotherapy. Patients
who developed abnormal liver function tests for any reason
while on study, had the following modifications: Docetaxel
was reduced by 25% for total bilirubin >2 mg/dL and
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >ULN. Docetaxel was
held in patients whose bilirubin was 2.5 mg/dL or who
had alkaline phosphatase or AST levels >5 ULN. Docetaxel therapy was resumed at a 25% dose reduction in
patients whose LFTs recovered within 3 weeks to grade 1
or less. Patients who received dose reduction for docetaxel
were allowed to be re-escalated once LFTs returned to normal. Patients whose LFTs did not recover within 3 weeks
of dose delay or reduction were taken off study.
In the case of nonhematologic toxicity from gefitinib,
only grade 3 to 4 diarrhea was considered significant to
withhold gefitinib therapy and reinstituted when toxicity
returned to grade 2 or less. Patients with poor tolerance to
skin toxicity were allowed a 14-day interruption and were
then allowed to resume at the 250-mg dosing after resolution of rash. Many patients taking part in other similar trials
experienced less severe rashes when treatment was resumed.
Patients were monitored weekly with physical
examinations, complete blood counts, and serum chemistry. In addition, a digital rectal examination, serum PSA,
and testosterone level were performed at screening, at
Week 5, and at the completion of docetaxel and gefitinib.
Each patient was reassessed by their primary surgeon for
RP after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. RP was performed
within 3 to 5 weeks of the last week of chemotherapy.

Statistical Analysis
Several studies of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before RP
have been conducted in patients with high-risk, clinically
786

localized prostate cancer, and all have reported pathologic
response rates of 0%.6-10 Thus, a pathologic response of
10% in the current study would be a significant finding.
With 29 patients, there was a 95% probability of observing at least 1 responder, if the underlying response rate is
10%. Similarly, if no successes were observed in 29
patients, a 90% confidence interval (CI) would not contain 10%. Upon completion of the study, the true pCR
rate was estimated based on RP specimens, and an exact
CI was constructed for the 29 patients. The target accrual
was 29 evaluable patients, a sample size associated with a
95% CI for the pathologic response rate of 10%.
Radical Prostatectomy
All RPs were performed in an open fashion through an
11-cm lower midline incision as described by Walsh and
Donker.17 All patients underwent a staging pelvic lymph
node dissection. Margins of resection included the obturator nerve, external iliac vein, Cooper ligament, and bifurcation of the external and internal iliac arteries. In the
absence of macroscopically metastatic disease, the prostate
was exposed by entering the endopelvic fascia. The deep
dorsal venous complex was divided and ligated to expose
the prostatic apex and the prostatic fascia. Nerve-sparing
techniques, via incision of the lateral prostatic fascia, were
used only in the absence of clinical evidence of extracapsular disease extension. Lateral pedicles were divided, and
the seminal vesicles were dissected completely. Finally,
the prostate was removed in a nonbladder neck–sparing
fashion. Anastomosis was performed using 6 monofilament 2-0 sutures.

Correlative Studies
EGFR and HER-2/neu were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining on pretherapy (biopsy) and post-therapy (RP) specimens to evaluate the relative changes in
expression. Correlative studies were performed at PhenoPath laboratories for EGFR (Dako AO485, Glostrup,
Denmark) and HER-2/neu (Zymed #28-005, South San
Francisco, Calif) on unstained slides of both biopsy and
prostatectomy specimens. A semiquantitative scoring system was used to report results. All pretreatment biopsies
and RP specimens were reviewed by our reference pathologist (C.I.).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Thirty-one patients were enrolled into this study (Table
1). The median age was 60 years (range, 46-74 years). The
median ECOG performance status was 0. The median
PSA was 7.43 ng/mL (range, 0.73 ng/mL-113 ng/mL),
and the median Gleason score was 8 (range, 6-10). Clinical staging of the patients consisted of T1c in 4 patients,
T2a in 9 patients, T2b in 4 patients, T2c in 4 patients,
and T3 in 10 patients. On the basis of the Kattan nomogram,18 the predicted biochemical progression-free probability after prostatectomy was 50%.

Clinical Response
One patient completed 2 cycles of chemotherapy, but was
found to have an enlarged pelvic lymph node and T4 disease at the time of surgical exploration, and did not
undergo RP. Postchemotherapy PSA reductions were
observed in 21 (68%) patients with a range of reduction
from 3% to 91%. PSA increases of >25% over baseline
Cancer

were noted in 2 patients. Testosterone levels monitored at
baseline, mid-therapy, and postchemotherapy were stable
throughout treatment with docetaxel and gefitinib. We
were able to evaluate 26 patients with pre- and posteMRI, and in 9 (35%) patients, radiographic changes in
tissue were demonstrated.

February 15, 2009

Thirty-one patients were evaluable for toxicity from chemotherapy. Over the course of treatment, the side effect profile
was mild in intensity. Toxicities included fatigue, diarrhea,
abdominal cramping, mouth sore, anemia, and asymptomatic elevation in liver function enzymes (Table 2). Grade 2
and 3 fatigue occurred in 6 and 1 (22%) patients. Grade 2, 3,
and 4 asymptomatic elevations in liver function enzymes
were observed in 5, 4, and 1 (32%) patients, respectively.
Three (10%) patients experienced grade 2 or 3 diarrhea.
Twenty-nine patients had no delay in time to RP. In 2
patients, RP was delayed 8 to 10 weeks after chemotherapy
because of pneumonia (no hospitalization), and 1 patient
experienced hematuria during the last cycle of chemotherapy.
This patient underwent cystoscopy, with examination performed under anesthesia, with findings of diffuse erythema in
the bladder. Biopsies revealed severe bladder mucosal inflammation with cystitis glandularis, which was believed to possibly be related to chemotherapy. RP was performed without
complication, and the patient had had no recurrence of hematuria at the time of last follow–up.

Pathologic Outcome
The 30 patients who underwent prostatectomy had a median Gleason sum score of 7 (range, 6-9) (Table 3). One
patient underwent surgical exploration and did not complete RP and was not included in the pathologic outcome.
Postprostatectomy pathologic stage consisted of pT2 in
17 patients, pT3 in 13 patients, and N1 disease in 4
patients (Table 3). Pathologic grade included a Gleason
score of 6 in 2 patients, a Gleason score of 7 in 19 patients,
a Gleason score of 8 in 1 patient, and a Gleason score of 9
in 8 patients. The median volume of residual disease consisted of 16.5% (range, <1%-90%) cancer in the specimen, with a mean of 26%. This translated into a range of
<1 g to 49 g of residual carcinoma. Thirteen (43%)
patients had extracapsular extension, and 8 (27%) had

Immunohistochemistry
As an exploratory objective, we performed immunohistochemical staining on 29 patients with HER-2/neu and
EGFR using a reference laboratory (PhenoPath) on biopsy
specimens and prostates postprostatectomy. By using immunohistochemical staining criteria developed for breast
cancer, the majority of patients stained negative for HER2/neu, and this did not change after therapy. In EGFR
staining, the majority (62% before and 70% after therapy)
of patients stained positive for EGFR, but there was no
appreciable changes in pre- and postprostatectomy
specimens.

rates are reported in Table 4. These quality of life outcomes were similar to our series of unilateral nerve-sparing
RP performed in patients not undergoing chemotherapy

Follow-up
At the time of last follow–up, all patients had completed
protocol therapy, and the median duration of follow-up

Prompted by reports that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
docetaxel for prostate cancer was safe and feasible,6-10 that
treatment with docetaxel in castrate progressive metastatic
prostate cancer improved survival,19,20 and that the combination of docetaxel and gefitinib had synergistic properties,
this phase 2 trial of gefitinib and docetaxel was undertaken
in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer before
RP. We observed no pCR in the 31 patients treated. This
combination was well tolerated, and did not result in
increased surgical morbidity.
Since the first study of neoadjuvant therapy in
locally advanced prostate cancer, our trial and 3 others
have investigated either docetaxel alone or in combination
with other chemotherapy agents in a comparable patient
population (Table 5).6,8,9,21 Several issues are clear from
these series of trials. Although all used docetaxel alone or
combined with other agents, collectively there was no
pCR. In addition, the optimal regimen and the duration
of neoadjuvant therapy necessary to produce a pathologic
response remains unclear. Surgical morbidity was acceptable across all studies.

Original Article

We tested the hypothesis that a noncytotoxic, tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR combined with docetaxel
would achieve a pCR in patients with prostate cancer.
Abnormally elevated EGFR tyrosine kinase activity is
observed in 40% to 90% of prostate cancers.22 However,
to our knowledge no activating mutations have been
described in prostate cancer.22 Gefitinib, by inhibiting
proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and promoting drug
delivery, could potentially enhance the cytotoxic effect
and act synergistically with docetaxel. By administering
therapy in the neoadjuvant setting, we were able to determine whether there were any effects of therapy on prostate
tissue. We did not find any correlation in the 2 markers
we tested, EGFR and HER-2/neu. There may be several
reasons for this, including that the exposure of gefitinib
may be too brief to see changes detectable by immunohistochemistry, and that the methods used may not be sensitive enough to detect a difference before and after
prostatectomy.
Since this trial was designed and completed, reports
of gefitinib alone in metastatic and nonmetastatic castratory hormone progressive prostate cancer have found no
responses (as defined as PSA declines).23-26 In addition,
there were no responses to the combination of docetaxel
and gefitinib compared with the treatment of docetaxel
alone.26 Furthermore, although there were no changes in
the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel combined with 250 mg
of gefitinib, at a higher dose, the area under the curve concentration for docetaxel was reduced by 20%.26 Most of
the patients on this trial received a total dose of 500 mg of
gefitinib before any dose reductions were performed.
Our trial evaluated 8 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy.
Other trials have evaluated the same duration, and up to 6
months.8,9,21 To the best of our knowledge, the optimal
duration and regimen for neoadjuvant chemotherapy of
prostate cancer has not been established to date. Even
with other trials investigating 6 months of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, there were no pCRs observed.21 As an
example of how the regimen and duration of therapy
impacts pCR, in trials of neoadjuvant for breast cancer, 4
cycles of chemotherapy reportedly achieves pCR ranging
from 4% to 13%.27 With the addition of sequential therapy to a noncross-resistant regimen and up to 6 months of
therapy, the pCR rate was reported to be 26% to 31%.27
The pathologic outcome and surgical morbidity in
the current study were similar to other high-risk series.8,21
790

In this study, 1 patient experienced rectal injury, which is
similar to the rate of 4.2% reported from a similar series
of high-risk patients without preoperative therapy.4 The
positive surgical margin rate of 33% in the current series is
similar to the rate of 48% to 65% reported in the literature for patients treated with hormonal therapy before
RP.4,5 Lymph node involvement, positive surgical margins, and organ-confined disease were comparable across
the studies.
The concept of neoadjuvant therapy before RP is
appealing, and bears further evaluation in randomized trials evaluating patients with high-risk, clinically localized
prostate cancer comparing docetaxel and androgen ablation followed by RP with RP alone. Given the negative
results reported in trials of neoadjuvant therapy and in the
advanced setting, gefitinib does not appear to have activity
either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in prostate cancer.
