Abstract
Despite the success of treating EGFR-mutant lung cancer
patients with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), all patients
eventually acquire resistance to these therapies. Although various resistance mechanisms have been described, there are
currently no FDA-approved therapies that target alternative
mechanisms to treat lung tumors with acquired resistance to
ﬁrst-line EGFR TKI agents. Here we found that EPHA2 is overexpressed in EGFR TKI-resistant tumor cells. Loss of EPHA2
reduced the viability of erlotinib-resistant tumor cells harboring EGFRT790M mutations in vitro and inhibited tumor growth
and progression in an inducible EGFRL858RþT790M-mutant lung
cancer model in vivo. Targeting EPHA2 in erlotinib-resistant

cells decreased S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of cell death
agonist BAD, resulting in reduced tumor cell proliferation
and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 by the small-molecule inhibitor ALW-II-41-27
decreased both survival and proliferation of erlotinib-resistant
tumor cells and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. ALW-II-41-27
was also effective in decreasing viability of cells with acquired
resistance to the third-generation EGFR TKI AZD9291. Collectively, these data deﬁne a role for EPHA2 in the maintenance of
cell survival of TKI-resistant, EGFR-mutant lung cancer and
indicate that EPHA2 may serve as a useful therapeutic target
in TKI-resistant tumors. Cancer Res; 76(2); 305–18. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

EGFR kinase activity (3) as well as exquisite sensitivity to ﬁrstgeneration EGFR-speciﬁc tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as
erlotinib (4–6). Unfortunately, approximately a year after commencing treatment all patients treated with EGFR TKIs acquire
resistance to these therapies (7). Sequencing efforts have revealed
that tumors with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs commonly
gain an additional mutation, T790M, in the gatekeeper position of
the kinase domain of EGFR (8). Currently, there are limited
options for the treatment of ﬁrst-generation EGFR TKI (erlotinib)-resistant tumors, although some success has been observed
with administration of second-generation (9) and third-generation (10) EGFR TKIs or combining antibody therapy targeting
EGFR with second-generation inhibitors (11). Risks of persistent
and/or mutation-speciﬁc targeting of EGFR include likely development of alternative mechanisms of TKI resistance distinct from
further mutations in EGFR (10), including oncogene addiction to
other kinases. Such "bypass" RTK signaling is a well-documented
mechanism of EGFR TKI resistance as evidenced by compensatory
activation of MET, HER2, AXL, IGF1R, and FGFR in the context of
EGFR TKI-acquired resistance (12–17). Identifying bypass pathways responsible for mediating TKI resistance may provide novel
targets needed for therapeutic intervention.
EPHA2 is overexpressed in lung cancer, correlating to poor
patient outcomes (18–20). EPHA2 belongs to the largest family of
RTKs, the EPH RTKs, which have been implicated in the regulation
of a wide array of pathological conditions, including cancer (21).
Upon binding to their ligands, EPHRINS, EPH RTKs oligomerize
and are capable of activating multiple downstream signaling
pathways, including RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and RHO/RAC
(21). We previously reported that targeting EPHA2 in ERBB2driven murine mammary tumor models resulted in impaired

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
in the United States despite a signiﬁcant number of advancements
in the molecular diagnosis and treatment of this disease (1). One
of the most extensively studied molecular subset in lung cancer is
those harboring activating mutations in the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene. These mutations, most commonly a
point mutation in exon 21 (L858R) or a deletion in exon 19
(LREA; ref. 2), are activating mutations that result in enhanced

tumor initiation and metastatic progression, and that heightened
levels of EPHA2 were sufﬁcient to mediate resistance to ERBB2 TKI
therapy in human breast cancer cell lines (22, 23). In lung cancer,
genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 results in
increased tumor cell death in vitro and decreased tumor burden
in vivo (24). However, the role of EPHA2 in resistance to EGFR
TKIs in lung cancer remains undeﬁned.
Because targeted inhibition of EPHA2 has proven useful in lung
cancer subtypes with constitutive MAPK signaling and because
EPHA2 expression positively correlates to TKI resistance of a
known ERBB family member in breast cancer, we hypothesized
that it would be an effective target for the treatment of EGFR TKIresistant lung cancer. In this study, we found that EPHA2 is
overexpressed in erlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells compared
with erlotinib-sensitive lung cancer cells. Genetic ablation of
EPHA2 in EGFRT790M-mutant, erlotinib-resistant cells led to both
increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Gene targeting of
EphA2 in an inducible, genetically engineered mouse model of
EGFR TKI resistance led to decreased tumor growth and progression. Treatment of EGFR TKI-resistant cells with an ATP-competitive, small-molecule TKI of EPHA2 ALW-II-41-27 decreased cell
viability in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, these
studies demonstrate the promise and utility of targeting EPHA2
in EGFR TKI-resistant lung cancer.

Materials and Methods
Microarray analysis
Data from 58 matched lung tumor specimens and adjacent
normal lung (116 total samples) with annotated mutation status
were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE32863;
ref. 25). Normalized gene expression data for EPHA2 were
extracted and compared between normal and tumor tissue in all
patients or by the presence or absence of the EGFR genotype. A
paired-sample Student t test was used to compare normal versus
tumor for each group, using patient-speciﬁc matching.
For microarray experiments, RNA was extracted from erlotinibsensitive and erlotinib-resistant cell lines in the absence of erlotinib for 72 hours (26). Microarray proﬁling was performed using
U133 Plus chips (Affymetrix). Normalized expression data were
analyzed in R3.1.1. Hierarchical clustering was performed using
the complete linkage algorithm. Distances for clustering were
calculated as 1  r, where r represents the correlation coefﬁcient
value. All tests are signiﬁcant at the two-sided 5% level, false
discovery rate; corrected P values were reported for multiple
comparisons.
Tumor biopsy samples
All patient tumor biopsy samples were obtained under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocols (Vanderbilt
University IRB# 050644). Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients. All samples were de-identiﬁed, and protected
health information was reviewed according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guidelines. Paired patient
tumor samples before and after TKI treatment were stained for
EPHA2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), as described in the IHC section, below. Of the 3 patient samples that
displayed elevated EPHA2 expression in post-relapse tumor sections, 1 patient harbored an EGFRT790M mutation (patient 14).
The mutation status of patient 12 is unknown. EGFRT790M was not
detected in patient 1, nor were mutations in BRAF, PI3K, KRAS, or

306 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

NRAS. Other mechanisms of resistance (such as MET ampliﬁcation or AXL) were not tested.
Cells and cell culture
EGFR-mutant PC-9 and HCC827 (DE746-A750) and PC-9/ER,
PC-9/ERC15, PC-9/ERC16, and HCC827/ER (DE746-A750;
T790M) non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were provided
by Dr. William Pao (Vanderbilt University). Erlotinib-resistant
cells were derived as described and characterized (27). AZD9291resistant cells were derived as described and characterized (28).
Cell lines were authenticated and sequenced for signature mutations (27). EGFR TKI-resistant lines were maintained in the
presence of 1 mmol/L erlotinib (Cell Signaling Technology)
throughout the study (refreshed every 72 hours), although experiments were routinely conducted after a 72-hour drug holiday.
ALW-II-41-27 and NG-25 were generously provided by Nathanael
Gray (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School).
ALW-II-41-27 was determined to have >99.7% purity by LC/MS
analysis. 293T cells used for lentivirus production were purchased
from the ATCC.
All lung cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
(Corning/Cellgro) supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mmol/L),
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Scientiﬁc, HyClone Laboratories Inc.), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100
mg/mL). 293T cells were grown in DMEM (Corning/Cellgro)
supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mmol/L), and 10% FBS. All
cells were grown in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 C.
Murine tumor studies
TetO-EGFRL858RþT790M and CCSP-rtTA mice were provided by
Dr. William Pao (Vanderbilt University) and have been described
previously (29, 30). EphA2-targeted mice have been described
previously (31) and were referred to herein as EphA2/ mice
because characterization of N-terminal (Bethyl Laboratories,
A302-024A) and C-terminal (Santa Cruz, #sc-924) EPHA2 expression revealed that neither the full length nor a truncated form of
EPHA2 is expressed in these mice (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Genotypes were conﬁrmed twice for each animal by analyzing
genomic DNA isolated from both tail and ear tissues. TetOEGFRL858RþT790M primers were 50 -ACTGTCCAGCCCACCTGTGT-30 and 50 -GCCTGCGACGGCGGCATCTGC-30 . CCSP-rtTA primers were 50 -ACTGCCCATTGCCCAAACAC-30 and 50 -AAAATCTTGCCAGCTTTCCCC-30 . EphA2 primers were 50 -GGGTGCCAAAGTAGAACTGCG-30 (forward), 50 -GACAGAATAAAACGCACGGGTG-30 (Neo), and 50 -TTCAGCCAAGCCTATGTAGAAAGC30 (reverse). Doxycyline was administered at the time of weaning
(3 weeks old) by feeding the mice doxycycline containing food
pellets (625 ppm; Harland-Tekland) to induce lung speciﬁc
expression of mutant EGFRL858RþT790M.
Lungs removed for gross and histological analysis were ﬁrst
perfused with 1 PBS followed by 10% buffered formalin
(Fisher). After 24 hours of ﬁxation in formalin, lungs were
weighed to determine a total wet weight. MRI analysis was performed at both 10 and 15 weeks of age following the initiation
of doxycycline administration at weaning. Tumor volumes
were calculated using Matlab 2012a (The MathWorks Inc.),
as described previously (24).
All animal experiments were conducted under guidelines
approved by the AAALAC and Vanderbilt University Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.

mice with or without EphA2. Mutant EGFR gene expression was induced by doxycycline (DOX) at 3 weeks of age.  , P < 0.005.

NSCLC, we analyzed a dataset of 58 matched normal and lung
adenocarcinoma tissue samples of which EGFR mutation status
was known. In all patients (n ¼ 58), levels of EPHA2 expression
were signiﬁcantly higher (P ¼ 0.003) in the tumor tissue than in
the adjacent normal lung tissue (Fig. 1A), consistent with ﬁndings
from previous studies (18–20). In patients whose tumors tested
positive for an EGFR mutation, EPHA2 expression was also
markedly increased compared with adjacent normal tissue
(Fig. 1A).
Given the known role of EPHA2 in promoting lung cancer
growth and survival (19, 24) and its contribution to drug resistance in breast cancer (23), we investigated if EPHA2 is upregulated in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells with EGFRT790M-mediated,
acquired resistance to erlotinib. The erlotinib-resistant, EGFRmutant lung cancer cell lines PC-9/ER and HCC827/ER were

generated after completion of a drug escalation protocol (27).
The resulting resistant cell lines tolerated erlotinib concentrations
more than 10 times the IC50 of their parental, TKI-sensitive
counterparts (Fig. 1B). Microarray analysis of PC-9 and PC-9/ER
cells revealed that three EPH receptors, EPHA2, EPHB2, and
EPHB4, were overexpressed in the erlotinib-resistant PC-9/ER
cells, compared with erlotinib-sensitive PC-9 parental cells (Fig.

in the same isogenic, paired cell lines (PC-9 and PC-9/ER) as well
as an independent erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant cell
line pair, HCC827 and HCC827/ER. EPHA2 was overexpressed in
all of the erlotinib-resistant cell lines (Fig. 1D), as well as in two
independent single-cell EGFRT790M-containing clones derived
from the PC-9/ER cell line (Fig. 1D), conﬁrming observations

from two pairs of isogenic erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant cell lines were treated with siControl or siEPHA2 for 72 hours. Shown are representative
immunoblots in which signaling molecules were detected with the indicated antibodies.

EPHA2 could be regulated by the presence of erlotinib, and
EPHA2 expression and phosphorylation increased in a timedependent manner after erlotinib withdrawal in PC-9/ERC16
cells (Fig. 1E), consistent with a previous observation that EPHA2
expression is regulated by MAPK signaling (35). In addition to
mRNA and protein expression levels, we assessed the cellular
localization of EPHA2 in the context of acquired resistance to
erlotinib. As judged by confocal immunoﬂuorescence, the presence of EPHA2 on the cell surface was not altered by sensitivity to
erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Finally, we assessed EPHA2 expression in samples from
patients with EGFR mutations pre- and post-development of
resistance to EGFR TKIs. In 4 samples with matched pretreatment and post-relapse tumor sections, we detected higher
EPHA2 protein levels by IHC than by IgG control stained
adjacent sections in 3 of the post-relapse tumor samples (Fig.
1F and Supplementary Fig. S2). Overall, we determined that
EPHA2 is overexpressed in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells
harboring EGFRT790M-mediated resistance to erlotinib compared with EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells with sensitivity to

EGFR inhibitors, suggesting a possible correlation between
EPHA2 expression and EGFR TKI sensitivity both in vitro and
in the clinical setting.
EPHA2 promotes the cell viability of erlotinib-resistant lung
cancer
To determine if EPHA2 was required for cellular survival in
EGFR TKI-resistant lung cancer, we knocked down the expression
of EPHA2 using a lentiviral-based shRNA strategy in four erlotinib-resistant and two erlotinib-sensitive lung cancer cell lines.
Both of the two independent shRNAs against EPHA2 (shEPHA2)
silenced EPHA2 protein expression and reduced cell viability
when tested 3 days after puromycin selection (Fig. 2A and B).
Although shEPHA2 reduced cell viability in both erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant cell lines, erlotinib-resistant cells displayed a greater dependence on EPHA2 for cell survival than
erlotinib-sensitive cell lines. For example, 72 hours after puromycin selection, EPHA2-deﬁcient, erlotinib-resistant PC-9/ER
and HCC827/ER cells displayed 20% and 40% cell viability,
respectively, while erlotinib-sensitive PC-9 and HCC827 cells
maintained 45% and 90% cell viability (Fig. 2C). We next performed a time course to monitor cell viability after EPHA2
knockdown in these cells. The results showed that by 5 days after
puromycin selection, EPHA2-deﬁcient, erlotinib-resistant cells
displayed a further reduction in the number of viable tumor cells,
in some cases with only 10% overall cell viability (Fig. 2D). These
data suggest that TKI-resistant lung cancer cells are dependent
upon EPHA2 RTK for survival.
To determine the contribution of EPHA2 kinase activity in
maintaining cell viability of erlotinib-resistant lung cancer, we
knocked down endogenous EPHA2 and rescued cells with either
wild-type EPHA2 or EPHA2D739N, a kinase-dead mutant (36). We
observed that wild-type EPHA2, but not EPHA2D739N, was sufﬁcient to restore cell viability to the control level (Supplementary
Fig. S3), indicating that EPHA2 kinase activity is required for
maintaining viability of erlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells.
EPHA2 promotes tumor growth in an inducible transgenic
model of EGFRL858RþT790M-mutant lung cancer in vivo
To assess the contribution of EPHA2 to EGFR TKI-resistant lung
cancer in vivo, we crossed EphA2-deﬁcient animals with an inducible EGFRL858RþT790M-mutant lung cancer transgenic model
(29, 31). In this model, expression of the mutant EGFR (TetOEGFRL858RþT790M; CCSP-rtTA) is induced upon doxycycline
administration and resulting tumors are resistant to erlotinib. To
assess tumor burden in lungs of EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2þ/þ and

EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2/ mice, we measured the lung wet
weight over a time course, as described previously (24, 37). A
signiﬁcant reduction in lung weight was observed in doxycyclinetreated, EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2/ mice compared with doxycycline-treated, EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2þ/þ mice (Fig. 3A).
Because no changes in lung weight were observed between
EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2/ and EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2þ/þ
mice that were not fed doxycycline, we attribute the differences
seen in mice fed doxycycline to a reduction in tumor burden.
To further quantify tumor burden, we monitored mice by MRI
when tumors had developed in both groups at 10 weeks of age
and again at 15 weeks of age (Fig. 3B). As expected, tumors did
not develop in any of the mice not fed doxycycline. Quantiﬁcation of the MRI images revealed that doxycycline-fed
EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2/ mice had a lower overall tumor burden than EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2þ/þ mouse counterparts, which
became more evident as the mice aged (Fig. 3C). EphA2 deﬁciency
also correlated to signiﬁcantly longer overall survival in this
model of TKI-resistant EGFRL858RþT790M-mutant lung cancer.
EphA2þ/þ mice did not survive past 25 weeks of age, whereas
more than 25% the EphA2/ mice survived longer than 1 year on
doxycycline (Fig. 3D).
Histological analysis of the lungs conﬁrmed the presence of
tumors and EGFRL858RþT790M expression in doxycycline-treated
animals as well as the absence of EPHA2 expression in EphA2
knockout animals (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis conﬁrmed
EPHA2 expression in the EphA2þ/þ animals and a complete lack
of EPHA2 protein expression in mice with a targeted deletion of
EphA2, as measured by anti-EPHA2 antibodies against either the
N-terminal or C-terminal regions of the EPHA2 protein (Supplementary Fig. S4). In doxycycline-fed, tumor-bearing mice, relative
levels of apoptosis, proliferation, and tumor microvessels were
quantiﬁed. Apoptosis was signiﬁcantly higher in the tumors of
EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2/ mice, than in tumors of
EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2þ/þ mice, as measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) staining (Fig. 4B and C). Tumor cell proliferation was
measured by staining tumor sections for PCNA (Fig. 4D). Proliferation was signiﬁcantly decreased in EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2/
tumors than in tumors of mice with wild-type levels of EPHA2
(Fig. 4E). Because previous murine studies in breast cancer have
indicated that EPHA2 can function to support tumor vasculature
(33), we assessed tumor microvessels by vWF IF. No signiﬁcant
differences in vWF staining were seen in the tumor tissue between
EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2þ/þ and EGFRL858RþT790M/EphA2/
mice (Fig. 4F and G). Together, these data indicate that EPHA2

is required for the maintenance and progression of EGFR TKIresistant lung cancer in their intrinsic setting and microenvironment, such that deletion of EphA2 limited proliferation and
induced apoptosis in this tumor model.
EPHA2 regulates cell viability in erlotinib-resistant cells
through upregulation of proliferation and inhibition of
apoptosis
To dissect the mechanism by which EPHA2 is required for cell
viability in erlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells, we quantiﬁed both
proliferation and apoptosis after silencing EPHA2 (shEPHA2) by
using a BrdU incorporation assay and a Cell Death ELISA, respectively. Upon EPHA2 knockdown, we observed a decrease in
proliferation of approximately 74% compared with shControl
cells, while cell lines sensitive to erlotinib displayed only a
22% decrease in proliferation (Fig. 5A). Consistent with this
effect, loss of EPHA2 in erlotinib-resistant cells resulted in a
3.4-fold increase in cellular apoptosis, compared with an only
2-fold increase in cells undergoing apoptosis from EPHA2 knockdown in erlotinib-sensitive cells (Fig. 5B). Knockdown of EPHA2
also increased cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 5C), conﬁrming elevated apoptosis in erlotinib-resistant cells. Signaling
analysis from two independent cell lines that contain EGFRT790Mmediated erlotinib resistance (PC-9/ERC16 and HCC827/ER)
revealed that loss of EPHA2 decreased phosphorylation of p90RSK, S6 kinase 1, and the proapoptotic BH3-only protein BAD,
whereas other effector proteins did not appear to be affected by
EPHA2 loss (Fig. 5D). The phenotype observed is not due to offtarget effects, as two independent siRNAs against EPHA2 recapitulated signaling defects seen in the pooled siEPHA2 knockdown
(Supplementary Fig. S5). These results consistently suggest a
mechanism by which EPHA2 expression maintains cell viability
in cells with acquired resistance to erlotinib by promoting both
survival and proliferation pathways.
Pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 decreases cell survival of
erlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells in vitro and tumor
growth in vivo
To assess the value of pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 in
lung cancer subsets with acquired resistance to ﬁrst-generation
EGFR TKIs, we treated cells with an EPHA2 small-molecule
inhibitor, ALW-II-41-27, that was recently characterized for
EPHA2 target engagement and speciﬁcity in the context of lung
cancer and melanoma both in vitro and in vivo (24, 38). NG-25, a
structural analogue that possesses a similar proﬁle of kinase
targets but does not inhibit EPHA2, was used as a control. We
ﬁrst assessed the effects of pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 via
ALW-II-41-27 on four cell lines with acquired resistance to erlotinib. TKI-resistant cells treated with 1 mmol/L of ALW-II-41-27
displayed a time-dependent decrease in the number of viable
tumor cells with an average reduction of cell viability of 60%
72 hours after drug treatment, whereas there was no signiﬁcant
change in the viability of cells treated with NG-25 at the same dose
(Fig. 6A). To determine the versatility of EPHA2 inhibition in
various contexts of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, we assessed
the effectiveness of ALW-II-41-27 on cells resistant to the thirdgeneration EGFR inhibitor AZD9291. We found that ALW-II-4127 inhibited cell viability to a similar extent in cells resistant to
AZD9291 as in cells resistant to erlotinib, suggesting that EPHA2
represents a potentially important bypass pathway that could be
leveraged in multiple settings of EGFR TKI resistance (Fig. 6B).

314 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

To determine whether the reduced cell viability observed upon
EPHA2 inhibitor treatment was due to decreased cell proliferation
or increased apoptosis, we performed BrdU incorporation and
Cell Death ELISA assays. Treatment with 1 mmol/L ALW-II-41-27
decreased cell proliferation (Fig. 6C) and increased apoptosis
(Fig. 6D) in erlotinib-resistant cell lines. ALW-II-41-27–induced
apoptosis was accompanied by the cleavage of caspase-3 and
PARP as well as decreased expression of antiapoptotic proteins
BCL-xL and MCL-1 (Fig. 6E). Immunoﬂuorescence studies
revealed that EPHA2 is located on the cell surface regardless of
sensitivity to erlotinib, but ALW-II-41-27 inhibited ligandinduced EPHA2 endocytosis, consistent with the notion that
EPHA2 kinase activity is required for receptor endocytosis (Supplementary Fig. S6). To assess the acute signaling consequences of
targeting EPHA2 via ALW-II-41-27 treatment, cell lysates were
collected from erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant lung
cancer cells after treatment with 1 mmol/L ALW-II-41-27 for 6
hours. Signaling studies revealed decreased phosphorylation of
EPHA2 (Y588 and S897) and its key effector proteins, such as p90RSK, S6K1, S6, and BAD (Fig. 6F), recapitulating the effects
observed in EPHA2 knockdown experiments. These data suggest
that ALW-II-41-27 inhibits EPHA2 signaling pathways necessary
to maintain proliferation and survival in erlotinib-resistant EGFRmutant lung cancer cells.
To assess the utility and efﬁcacy of ALW-II-41-27 on tumors
with acquired resistance to erlotinib in vivo, we treated xenografted
tumors (HCC827/ER or PC-9/ERC16) with ALW-II-41-27, erlotinib, or the vehicle alone twice a day at 15 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection. After 14 days of the treatment regimen, ALW-II41-27 signiﬁcantly inhibited growth of the erlotinib-resistant
tumors (Fig. 7A and B). Toxicity as measured by body weight
was not signiﬁcantly changed by any of the drugs compared with
the vehicle over the course of this study (data not shown). Analysis
of tumor lysates revealed decreased phosphorylation of EPHA2
(Y588 and S897), p90-RSK, and S6K1 (Fig. 7C and D), consistent
with results observed in vitro (Fig. 6F). These data indicate that
pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 may be advantageous in lung
cancers with acquired resistance to erlotinib as inhibition of this
receptor is able to mitigate key survival signaling pathways and
induce an apoptotic phenotype.

Discussion
EGFR-mutant lung tumors acquire resistance to TKIs through a
variety of mechanisms, including secondary mutations within
EGFR at position T790 (8), mutations in EGFR effector proteins
(39, 40), histologic transformation (39), and upregulation of
parallel RTKs (e.g., MET, HER2, and AXL; refs. 13, 14, 17). Here we
have demonstrated that EPHA2 overexpression serves as an additional novel mechanism of drug resistance particularly in
EGFRT790M-mutant lung cancer. We found that knockdown of
EPHA2 resulted in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in erlotinib-resistant cells with EGFRT790M mutations. Genetic
targeting of EphA2 signiﬁcantly inhibited EGFRL858RþT790Mmutant lung tumor progression and prolonged overall survival
in vivo. Furthermore, an EPHA2 small molecule inhibitor, ALW-II41-27, mitigated viability of erlotinib-resistant cells and reduced
tumor growth in a xenograft model. These data suggest that
pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 may represent a viable,
alternative strategy for treating EGFRT790M-mutant lung cancers
harboring resistance to ﬁrst-line EGFR TKI therapies.

The ability of EPHA2 to maintain cell viability in the context of
tumorigenesis has been demonstrated previously. EPHA2 overexpression has been observed to contribute to tumorigenesis in a
variety of tissues, including breast, ovary, skin, brain, and lung
(20, 41–43). Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that
EPHA2 has a distinct role in tumor promotion in the epithelial
component of both breast and lung tumors, as evidenced by
targeted inhibition of EPHA2 in murine models of these tumor

types (22, 24). Previous studies in breast cancer and glioma have
established that EPHA2 signaling is mitigated upon ligand
engagement, whereas ligand-independent EPHA2 signaling and
cross-talk with other oncogenic pathways serve to promote tumor
cell proliferation and motility (22, 36, 44). In lung cancer, the
tumor-promoting role of EPHA2 appears to be ligand independent, as exogenous EPHRIN-A1 stimulation inhibits tumor cell
proliferation (45). In our study, the EPHA2 inhibitor ALW-II-41-

27 reduced the phosphorylation of both Y588 and S897 of the
EPHA2 receptor (Fig. 6F), suggesting that both tyrosine and serine
phosphorylation may be important in maintaining cell viability
in EGFR TKI-resistant tumor cells. As ALW-II-41-27 is a kinase
inhibitor, inhibition of EPHA2 kinase activity will result in
reduced phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane tyrosine residue
Y588. In contrast, reduced levels of phosphorylation at S897 of
EPHA2 are likely the result of inhibition of phosphorylation of
RSK (46) or AKT (36), both of which were reduced in ALW-II-4127–treated samples.
Although the EPHA2 receptor has previously been shown to
regulate RAS/MAPK signaling in breast cancer cells (22, 35), in
EGFRT790M-mutant lung cancer, loss of EPHA2 does not appear to
signiﬁcantly affect the activities of ERK, but rather modulates
phosphorylation levels of p90-RSK, S6K1 (a known substrate of
mTORC1), and the proapoptotic protein BAD. These results are
consistent with the recent ﬁndings that activation of mTORC1 is
associated with acquired resistance of EGFR-mutant lung cancer to
combined EGFR inhibition via a TKI and cetuximab (47).
mTORC2 has also been implicated in the maintenance of EGFR
TKI-resistant lung cancer (48); however, the degree to which
mTORC2 plays a role in EPHA2-mediated maintenance of cell
viability in erlotinib resistant cells remains to be determined.
Targeting EPHA2 in EGFR TKI-resistant lung tumors represents
a unique opportunity for mitigating cell viability, as our studies
have demonstrated that erlotinib-resistant cells are more dependent on EPHA2 for cell viability than erlotinib-sensitive cells (Fig.
5A and B). Knockdown of EPHA2 induced a greater than 3-fold
increase in cell death and greater than 3-fold reduction in proliferation in erlotinib-resistant cells relative to their parental, erlotinib-sensitive counterparts. These data indicate a distinct addiction of EGFRT790M-mutant lung tumors to EPHA2 for survival,
and it may illuminate why RNAi-mediated EPHA2 knockdown
experiments as well as pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2
appear to be remarkably effective without the combination of
other inhibitors. It is, however, possible that combination of an
EPHA2 inhibitor in this context with inhibitors of other kinases,
such as EGFR, MEK, ERK, or IGF-1R, could further diminish cell
survival. Additional investigation is needed to assess whether the
EPHA2 signaling addiction observed is speciﬁc to the erlotinibmediated development of EGFRT790M or if it is a universal feature
of EGFRT790M resistance acquired in the presence of any EGFR TKI.
Preliminary data from our laboratory indicate that cells with
acquired resistance to two, unique second-generation EGFR inhibitors, afatinib or XL-647, and a third-generation EGFR inhibitor,
AZD9291, also display overexpression of EPHA2 compared with
cells sensitive to these inhibitors and are highly sensitive to
EPHA2 inhibition (Figs. 1D and Fig. 6B, and data not shown).
Studies to characterize the role of EPHA2 in viability maintenance
of EGFR-mutant cells with acquired resistance to second- and
third-generation EGFR TKIs are currently in progress.
Although strategies to overcome EGFRT790M-mediated TKI
resistance are rapidly evolving, including but not limited to the
development of EGFRT790M mutant–speciﬁc EGFR inhibitors (10)
and the combination of second-generation EGFR TKIs with antibodies against EGFR such as cetuximab (11), persistent treatment
of a single target (e.g., EGFR) may make tumors more likely to
engage in alternative, non–EGFR-related bypass escape mechanisms (10). Recent studies indicate that optimizing the dose and
sequence of TKI treatment may be an essential component in the
effective treatment of EGFRT790M disease (27, 28). We have

316 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

observed that EPHA2 expression in EGFRT790M-mutant cells
increases in a time-dependent fashion after being withdrawn
from erlotinib (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, there have been several
clinical reports of patients with EGFRT790M-mutant lung tumors
that exhibited a ﬂare of tumor growth after TKI withdrawal
(49, 50). This could be due in part to the surge in EPHA2
expression we observe upon EGFR TKI withdrawal. It is quite
possible that EPHA2 inhibition may be most efﬁcacious in
EGFRT790M-mutant tumors during an EGFR TKI "holiday," when
EPHA2 levels are at their highest. Because EPHA2 inhibition
preferentially eliminates EGFR TKI-resistant cells over EGFR
TKI-sensitive cells (Fig. 5A), it is reasonable to hypothesize that
after a regimen of EPHA2 inhibition the tumor may be repopulated with more EGFR TKI-sensitive cells and may rerespond to
ﬁrst-line EGFR TKIs. Thus, it may be possible in the future to treat
EGFRT790M-mutant tumors with cycles of sequential EGFR TKIs
followed by EPHA2 inhibitors with the ultimate goal of eradicating both the EGFR TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant disease.
Although the speciﬁcity and functional importance of the EPHA2
pharmacologic inhibitor ALW-II-41-27 have already been characterized previously in the context of lung cancer (24), further
compound iterations are in development to enhance target speciﬁcity and pharmacodynamics in vivo.
In summary, we show that EPHA2 overexpression is required
for survival of erlotinib-resistant lung cancer, and that both
genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 results in
decreased survival and proliferation of cells with EGFRT790Mmediated, erlotinib resistance. These studies not only present
evidence for the utility of EPHA2 inhibitors in the treatment of
erlotinib-resistant tumors, but also provide a rationale for optimizing the sequence of treatment with existing ﬁrst-generation
EGFR inhibitors to maximize patient beneﬁt.
