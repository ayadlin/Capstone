BACKGROUND: Omacetaxine, a protein synthesis inhibitor, is indicated in the United States for the treatment of patients with
chronic-phase (CP) or accelerated-phase (AP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with resistance and/or intolerance to 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors. METHODS: The final analysis, with 24 months of follow-up, included additional efficacy and safety analyses to
assess the benefit of long-term omacetaxine administration (1.25 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days every 28 days followed by 7 days every 28 days) in CP-CML and AP-CML patients receiving >3 cycles. RESULTS: Eighteen percent of CP-CML patients achieved a major
cytogenetic response (MCyR) with a median duration of 12.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5 months to not reached [NR]);
responses were maintained for 12 months in 3 of 14 responders, and the median overall survival (OS) was 40.3 months (95% CI, 23.8
months to NR). Among patients with AP-CML, 14% achieved or maintained a major hematologic response for a median of 4.7 months
(95% CI, 3.6 months to NR); MCyR was not achieved, and the median OS was 14.3 months (95% CI, 6.7-18.7 months). In patients with
CP-CML and patients with AP-CML who received >3 cycles of treatment (n 5 50 and n 5 14, respectively), the median OS was 49.3
months (95% CI, 23.8 months to NR) and 24.6 months (95% CI, 12-37.2 months), respectively. Grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicities
were the major side effects (79% and 73% for CP-CML and AP-CML, respectively), with discontinuation due to toxicity in 10% of CP
patients and in 5% of AP patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the long-term administration of omacetaxine is feasible
with dose adjustments to manage toxicities and that omacetaxine provides a durable benefit for some patients. Cancer 2015;121:1637C 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the expression of the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein,1-3 and overall survival (OS) for patients with CML has greatly improved since the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target BCR-ABL1.4 Most patients are responsive to TKI therapy5-9; however, over time, patients may develop resistance to
TKI therapy, often because of mutations in the BCR-ABL1 gene or increases in BCR-ABL1 expression.10-12 Furthermore,
TKI intolerance may occur, occasionally with cross-intolerance between multiple TKIs.8,13 Thus, a non-TKI approach is
warranted in patients who are resistant or intolerant to multiple TKIs.
Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (omacetaxine), a protein synthesis inhibitor, binds directly to the ribosome and
blocks the initial step of protein translation.14 Omacetaxine induces apoptosis by reducing levels of multiple shortCorresponding author: Jorge Cortes, MD, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Box 428, Houston, TX 77030; Fax: (713)

cMyc, and cyclin D1.15-18 Because direct BCR-ABL1

Omacetaxine was approved in the United States
for the treatment of patients with chronic-phase (CP) or
accelerated-phase (AP) CML with resistance and/or an
intolerance to 2 or more TKIs on the basis of an analysis
(CML-300) of data pooled from two phase 2, openlabel, international, multicenter studies (CML-202 and
CML-203).23-25 Initial results from CML-300 showed
that 20% of patients with CP-CML achieved a durable
major cytogenetic response (MCyR) with a median
response duration of 17.7 months,23 and 27% of
patients with AP-CML achieved a major hematologic
response (MHR) that was maintained for a median of 9
months.24
Here we report the final efficacy and safety data for
omacetaxine in the CML-300 cohort after a minimum of
24 months of follow-up. We also evaluate the benefit and
safety of long-term omacetaxine administration through
an examination of the outcomes of those who received >3
cycles of treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

This report is the final analysis, with a minimum of
24 months of follow-up, of efficacy and safety data for
patients with CP-CML or AP-CML with resistance or
intolerance to 2 TKIs enrolled in two phase 2 clinical trials of omacetaxine. Both study protocols (CML202 and CML-203) were approved by the relevant
institutional review boards. Patient enrollment criteria
and omacetaxine administration have been described in
detail previously.23,24 A history of T315I was required
for patients in the CML-202 study only.13 Additional
post hoc efficacy and safety analyses were performed
for the subset of patients who received >3 cycles of
omacetaxine.
Patients

Patients who were 18 years or older with Philadelphia
chromosome–positive CML (either CP or AP) were enrolled. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2.
Eligible patients were previously treated with imatinib
and had documentation of resistance or intolerance to
dasatinib and/or nilotinib.

Treatment

Omacetaxine (1.25 mg/m2 subcutaneously twice daily for
up to 14 consecutive days every 28 days) was administered
as induction therapy until hematologic response, followed
by maintenance dosing (1.25 mg/m2 twice daily for up to
7 days per 28-day cycle) for up to 24 months or until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without evidence of a clinical response after 6 cycles of induction
were removed from the study. In cases of hematologic toxicity, the number of dosing days was decreased in 2-day
increments to maintain an absolute neutrophil
count > 0.5 3 109/L and a platelet count > 50 3 109/L;
no adjustments were made in patients with a white blood
cell count > 10 3 109/L or an absolute blast count > 5 3
109/L. For nonhematologic toxicity, a treatment delay
was permitted for grade 2 or higher events that were unresponsive to supportive care; after resolution, treatment
could resume with a reduction in the number of consecutive treatment days per cycle.
Assessments

Laboratory analyses, including complete blood counts,
were performed every 7 days during induction cycles and
every 14 days during maintenance or as clinically indicated. Bone marrow aspiration and cytogenetic analysis
were performed every 3 months on study; hematologic
and cytogenetic responses (as defined in the supporting
information [see online supporting information]) were
assessed by an independent review committee. An assessment of BCR-ABL1 transcripts is described in the supporting information. Toxicities were assessed according to
National Cancer Institute criteria (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0). Serious
adverse events (AEs) included death or life-threatening
events or events that required hospitalization or interventions to prevent disability, permanent damage, or death.
Statistical Analyses

Safety was evaluated in the CML-300 population, which
comprised CP-CML and AP-CML patients with resistance and/or intolerance to imatinib and at least 1 other
TKI, with data pooled from two phase 2 studies. Eleven
patients from the CML-300 population were excluded
from efficacy analyses because of the presence of a
response at the baseline (CP-CML, n 5 2; AP-CML,
n 5 6) or study site compliance issues (CP-CML, n 5 3).
The primary endpoint was MCyR (a complete cytogenetic response [CCyR] or a partial cytogenetic
response) in patients with CP-CML and the achievement
of MHR (including a complete hematologic response

[CHR] maintained for 4 weeks or no evidence of leukemia [NEL]) and/or MCyR in patients with AP-CML.
The Clopper-Pearson method was used to calculate 1sided lower 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for primary efficacy measures. The time to progression and OS were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier methods (defined in the
supporting information [see online supporting
information]).

RESULTS
Patient Disposition and Exposure

Eighty-one patients with CP-CML and 41 patients with
AP-CML had resistance and/or intolerance to imatinib
and at least 1 other TKI and were included in the safety
analyses; for efficacy analyses, 76 patients with CP-CML
and 35 patients with AP-CML were considered evaluable
(Supporting Fig. 1 [see online supporting information]).
At the close of the study, 6 patients with CP-CML and 1
patient with AP-CML were continuing treatment
(patients outside the United States were transferred to
compassionate use, and those within the United States
were able to receive commercially available drug). Overall,
65% of the CP patients and 41% of the AP-CML patients
received >3 cycles of treatment (Table 1). In CP-CML
patients, discontinuation due to AEs was more frequent
during early cycles (Table 1). The most common cause of
discontinuation across all cycles was progressive disease.
The median duration of study participation for patients
with CP-CML and AP-CML was 8.8 months (95% CI,
7.1-11.2 months) and 3.4 months (95% CI, 1.9-6.4
months), respectively. At the time of analysis, 74% of the

patients had updated survival follow-up information (ie,
within 6 months).
Baseline Characteristics

Characteristics of the overall population and those who
received >3 cycles are summarized in Supporting Table 1
(see online supporting information). Baseline characteristics of patients who remained progression-free and continued to received omacetaxine at the study’s close (n 5 6)
are presented in Supporting Table 2 (see online supporting information); these patients were typically younger
(<65 years) with a good performance status. Four of the 6
ongoing CP patients had CHR at the baseline.
Exposure and Safety

Omacetaxine exposure in the CML-300 population and
in patients who received >3 cycles is summarized in Table
2. The safety profile of omacetaxine with extended followup did not differ substantially from that reported previously on the basis of initial analyses23,24 (Supporting Table 3 [see online supporting information]). Hematologic
AEs were the most common grade 3/4 events; rates of
grade 3/4 hematologic AEs were highest during the first 3
cycles and decreased after cycle 3 with a corresponding
decrease in the median number of dosing days per cycle,
particularly in patients with CP-CML (Fig. 1). Incidence
rates of grade 3/4 hematologic AEs during the first 3
cycles were similar in patients who received >3 cycles of
omacetaxine and patients who received 1 to 3 cycles of
omacetaxine (Fig. 2). Treatment delays remained relatively common in both disease phases after cycle 3, with
nearly all patients requiring a delay in at least 1

maintenance cycle. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and
patient scheduling or logistics were the most common
causes of treatment delays in CP-CML and AP-CML
patients after cycle 3.
The most common nonhematologic grade 3/4 AEs
in patients receiving >3 cycles were infections, which
occurred in 13% of CP-CML patients and 41% of APCML patients (Supporting Table 3 [see online supporting
information]). Grade 3/4 pneumonia was experienced by
4% of CP-CML patients and 18% of AP-CML patients.
Most other nonhematologic AEs were grade 1/2; diarrhea,
fatigue, and nausea were the most common. The incidence
of grade 3/4 general symptoms (eg, fatigue and pyrexia),
skin disorders, and administration site conditions was low.
Grade 3/4 events that first occurred during or after
cycle 12 are summarized in Supporting Table 4 (see
online supporting information). Those considered related
to treatment in CP-CML patients were anemia (n 5 3),
thrombocytopenia (n 5 3), neutropenia (n 5 3), and
insomnia, leukopenia, nausea, fatigue, lobar pneumonia,
irregular heart rate, and lung infection (n 5 1 for each); in
AP-CML patients, they included anemia (n 5 2), neutropenia (n 5 2), and leukopenia and thrombocytopenia
(n 5 1 for each).
Serious AEs occurred in 46 patients with CP-CML
(57%) and in 23 patients with AP-CML (56%). The incidence of serious AEs was generally similar between the
overall population and patients with >3 cycles (Supporting Table 5 [see online supporting information]). The
most common serious AEs were myelosuppression and
related events, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage,
pyrexia, and infections. One patient developed myelodys1640

plastic syndrome >30 days after the last dose of omacetaxine. This patient received 41 cycles of omacetaxine and
had a history of several chemotherapy agents and 5 allogeneic transplants before omacetaxine treatment; the investigator considered the event to be possibly related to the
study drug. Another patient who was excluded from the
pivotal analysis (because of prior treatment with only 1
TKI) developed myelodysplastic syndrome after omacetaxine treatment. The patient’s history included prostate
cancer, but his treatment history was unavailable; the
event was considered unrelated to the treatment by the
investigator.
Two CP-CML patients and 4 AP-CML patients
died during treatment or within 30 days of the last study
dose (on-study deaths). No on-study deaths were considered related to the study drug. The causes of on-study
deaths in CP-CML patients included disease progression
in 1 patient (during cycle 3) and multiorgan failure in 1
patient (during cycle 1). In AP-CML patients, the causes
of on-study deaths were disease progression (n 5 2 during
cycles 2 and 5) and cerebral hemorrhage (n 5 2, both during cycle 2).
Efficacy in CP-CML Patients

At the time of the final analysis, the MCyR rate was
unchanged from the rate in the initial analysis. Among
patients with resistance or intolerance to 2 or more TKIs,
the MCyR rate was 20% (16/81; 1-sided 95% lower confidence limit [LCL], 13%).23 In the evaluable population,
the MCyR rate was 18% (14/76; 1-sided 95% LCL,
12%) with a median response duration of 12.5 months
(95% CI, 3.5 months to not reached [NR]); this included

a CCyR rate of 8% (6 of 76). Seventy percent (53/76) of
evaluable patients achieved or maintained CHR with a
median response duration of 11.1 months (95% CI, 8.423.3 months).
In patients receiving >3 cycles in the evaluable population (n 5 50), the MCyR rate was 22%; 3 patients
(6%) maintained a response for 12 months (Table 3).
Further analyses in this subgroup showed that among
patients with the T315I mutation (n 5 16), 3 achieved
MCyR (19%; 1-sided 95% LCL, 5%; Table 3). One
achieved a confirmed CCyR at cycle 2 and received a total
of 41 cycles of omacetaxine; the estimated proportion of
T315I transcripts decreased from 100% at the baseline to
0% by cycle 11 and remained low until discontinuation.
The second patient, who achieved unconfirmed CCyR at
cycle 6, continued receiving omacetaxine treatment and
maintained CHR for 22 cycles. In this patient, the estimated proportion of T315I transcripts was reduced from
100% at the baseline to 0% by cycle 11 and remained low
until discontinuation. The third patient achieved a confirmed partial cytogenetic response; the proportion of
T315I transcripts decreased from 50% at the baseline to
40% by cycle 1. No other assessments of the mutant transcript level were documented for this patient. Among CPCML patients who received 12 cycles of omacetaxine
(n 5 21), the MCyR rate was 29% (n 5 6); half of the responders (n 5 3) maintained a response for 12 months
(Table 3).

The median progression-free survival (PFS) for
the evaluable population was 9.6 months (95% CI,
6.8-11.3 months), and the median OS was 40.3
months (95% CI, 23.8 months to NR). Among those
who received >3 cycles of omacetaxine, the median
PFS and OS were 9.9 months (95% CI, 7-12 months)
and 49.3 months (95% CI, 23.8 months to NR),
respectively.
Efficacy in AP-CML Patients

At the time of this final analysis, the MHR rate was 14%
(5/35); this included CHR in 4 patients and NEL in 1
patient. The median duration of MHR was 4.7 months
(95% CI, 3.6 months to NR). None of the patients with
AP-CML achieved MCyR. The median PFS and OS for
all AP-CML patients were 3.6 months (95% CI, 1.9-6.5
months) and 14.3 months (95% CI, 6.7-18.7 months),
respectively.
Fourteen patients with AP-CML received >3
cycles of omacetaxine treatment; 29% achieved MHR.
Three patients with AP-CML received 12 cycles.
One patient with a response received a total of 22
cycles and maintained MHR for 11.4 months; the duration of MHR in the other 3 responders was 3 to 5

Final Analysis of Omacetaxine in CML/Cortes et al

Figure 2. Proportions of (A) CP-CML patients and (B) APCML patients with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, anemia, or
neutropenia during the first 3 cycles of omacetaxine treatment among patients who received 3 cycles of treatment
and patients who received >3 cycles of treatment (the CML300 population). Only patients with laboratory test results
were included. AP indicates accelerated phase; CML, chronic
myeloid leukemia; CP, chronic phase.

OS was 40.3 months in CP patients (33.9 months in the
initial report), whereas the median PFS remained
unchanged.23 In AP patients, the median values for both
PFS and OS were similar to those reported in earlier
analyses.24 Patients with more than 3 cycles of omacetaxine treatment displayed a trend toward longer PFS and
OS than the overall population. Furthermore, extended
exposure to omacetaxine in these heavily pretreated
patients was feasible and safe, and a small number of CP
patients demonstrated a durable responses (>12
months). This suggests that omacetaxine may be considered as part of a long-term strategy or as a bridging therapy to transplantation in patients who are eligible for the
procedure.

CP-CML and AP-CML patients received up to 58
and 29 treatment cycles, respectively; a small subset of
patients (5 with CP-CML and 1 with AP-CML) continued to receive omacetaxine treatment for more than 3.5
years. Although hematologic and cytogenetic responses in
CP-CML and AP-CML patients were often achieved
within the first 3 cycles, a number of patients achieved
MCyR after cycle 3, and the onset of CCyR occurred as
late as 8.5 months. This suggests that some patients without a response after initial cycles may achieve late
responses.
A reduction in T315I transcripts was observed in
some patients with the T315I mutation, including 1 CPCML patient with a confirmed CCyR who had an estimated 100% T315I transcripts at the baseline, which was
reduced below the detection limit by cycle 11. Previous
studies in a preclinical mouse model15 and in patients
with T315I with prior TKI treatments13,26,27 have shown
that omacetaxine treatment reduces the proportion of
T315I-positive cells, and this may enable rechallenge with
second-generation TKIs. Furthermore, 1 patient with
CP-CML who demonstrated pan-TKI resistance achieved
a stable, long-lasting (>5 years) major molecular response
with omacetaxine treatment.13,26-28 Whether this is a
direct effect of omacetaxine on the mutated clone or a
result of withdrawal of the TKI, as has been previously
suggested,27 cannot be determined in this analysis. In
future studies, it will be interesting to explore whether
there is indeed a correlation between omacetaxine exposure and the mutant transcript level and to confirm
whether a reduction in mutant transcripts is associated
with an objective response in patients.
Nonhematologic toxicities that were observed were
generally mild, with the exception of infection. The incidence of grade 3/4 hematologic events was generally highest during the first 3 cycles and correlated with increased
exposure to omacetaxine during induction; this suggests
that toxicities are reversible and manageable with dose
adjustments. Dose delays and reductions of the number of
dosing days are encouraged as needed to manage myelosuppression and limit treatment discontinuation during
the first 3 cycles. Continued management of symptoms
during maintenance may also be necessary to prolong disease control.
In summary, the results of extended follow-up analyses are consistent with earlier results and suggest that
long-term administration of omacetaxine is feasible and
safe with dose adjustments to manage toxicities. Durable
hematologic and cytogenetic responses may be achieved
and sustained in a minority of patients.
