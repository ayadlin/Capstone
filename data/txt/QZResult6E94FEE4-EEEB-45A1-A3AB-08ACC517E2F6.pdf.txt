ABSTRACT
Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) gene polymorphisms have been closely associated with
the development of advanced cancers while PON1 secretion to the serum is linked
with inhibition of oxidized high-density lipoprotein by its antioxidative function. Our
group previously demonstrated that post-translational modification of serum PON1 in
form of fucosylated PON1 is a potential biomarker of small cell lung cancer. Here, we
interrogated the role of PON1 in the pathobiology of lung cancer (LC) by addressing cellautonomous mechanisms using gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches and
protein expression profiling of tissue samples in our clinical biobank. PON1 expression
in LC patient tissues varied between overexpression in squamous cell carcinoma and
minimal loss in adenocarcinoma sub-types. Simultaneous overexpression of PON1 both at
the gene and protein stability levels induced pro-oncogenic characteristics in LC cells and
xenografts. PON1 overexpression supported metastatic progression of LC by decreasing
G1/S ratio and LC cell senescence involving p21Waf1/Cip1. PON1 suppressed drug- and
ligand-induced cell death and protected LC cells from genotoxic damages with maintained
ATP levels, requiring p53-directed signals. PON1 promoted ROS deregulation protecting
the mitochondria from dysregulation. PON1 knockdown resulted in the blockage of its
antioxidant function in LC cells through Akt signaling with reduced invasive signature
as a consequence of scant expression. Targeted glycolysis stimulated PON1 antioxidant
activity regulating phosphorylation of AMPK-α. The functional data imply that exploitation
of the antioxidative function of PON1 is consequential in driving LC pathogenesis at the
cell-autonomous mechanistic level with consequences on tumor growth.

and homeostasis [1, 2]. Redox signaling plays a vital role
in malignant tumor cell transformation through reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-mediated function. Dysregulation
of this specific redox utility results in the development
of various diseases including cancers [3]. Importantly,

dysfunctions in the expression of high density lipoprotein
(HDL)-bound proteins affect antioxidative functions in
various cancers with its macrophage cholesterol efflux
function as a critical player [4]. Clinical studies have
shown that low serum HDL cholesterol, which serves as a
carrier-delivery platform for lipoprotein-bound proteins to
the circulation, is associated with acquired advanced lung
cancer (LC) incidence [5, 6].
Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is an HDL-binding
protein with antioxidant properties, along with two
other paraoxonases PON2 and PON3 [7]. PON1 is
bound to circulating HDL particles and is known to
enzymatically hydrolyze organophosphates involved
in lipid metabolism of diseases [8]. The function of
PON1 is anticipated in cancer disease models since it
is found that certain PON1 genotypes were prone to
be a cancer risk factor such as the occurrence of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in variant alleles of
PON1 [9, 10]. In cancer, PON2 and PON3’s association
is based on their up-regulated expressions in various
tumors with anti-apoptotic and protective effects in
the mitochondria from several chemical-mediated
dysfunctions [11]. Nevertheless, all PONs are implicated
in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases
including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and cancer. Since
it is reported that the pro-inflammatory cytokines such
as IL1β and TNF downregulate PON1 expression and
secretion to serum by liver cells, it is likely that the lower
levels of PON1 in serum can be a result of unhealed
long-lasting inflammatory conditions in LC patients.
Collectively, addressing PON1 needs to be completed so
we understand better the roles of PONs in redox system
and cell death regulation in cancers.
Our understanding of the molecular basis of
PON1-implicated cancer pathogenesis has been limited
by the scarcity of mechanistic studies that look beyond
PON1 genetic polymorphisms and enzyme activity.
To address this lack thereof, we seek to dissect, at
the cell-autonomous level, whether PON1 displays
oncogenic characteristics primed by its antioxidative
function. We examined PON1 protein expression in
LC tissues of human patients and corroborated this
with PON1 copy number analysis using TCGA datasets
of human LC tumors. Then we further elaborated the
consequence of PON1 regulation in LC cells and tumor
xenografts and that the exploitation of its antioxidative
function can impact tumorigenesis and escape from
cell death. Our study reveals that overexpression of
PON1 intracellularly can stimulate LC cell outgrowth
and induce anti-apoptotic effects through antioxidative
function regulating ROS and glycolytic metabolism
while PON1 suppression can reduce Akt-directed cell
metastasis. We present evidence for PON1 having antiapoptotic and anti-oxidative features in LC cells eliciting
tumor growth.

Varied PON1 protein and gene expressions in
lung cancer tumor tissue sub-types and lung
cancer cell lines
Tissue-based protein expression analysis revealed
that PON1 has a varied expression pattern between
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and lung adenocarcinoma
tissues. In 8 matched cases, SCC tissues revealed a shallow
overexpression (in densitometry) than adjacent normal
tissues, while in 16 matched cases of adenocarcinoma,
PON1 is minimally decreased (Figure 1A). Clinicopathological information-based categorization of the 39
matched tissues (Table 1) affirmed higher PON1 protein
expression at LC stage II than in stages I and III (Figure
1B). LC tissues of recurrent and non-recurrent groups
showed no significant difference (Figure 1C), but this
can be a result of our limited sample cohorts of SCC
(non-recurrent: 7 cases; recurrent: 3 cases) and lung
adenocarcinoma (non-recurrent: 16 cases; recurrent: 13
cases). PON1 is slightly up-regulated in younger agegroup of 20-59 compared to older groups of 60-65 and
66-85 both in LC tissues (Figure 1D). Slight differences
were observed between normal and LC tissues of patients
with or without smoking history (smoker) and nonsmokers (Figure 1E), and of between female and male
patients (Figure 1F), respectively. Representative blots
of PON1 protein expression in LC tissues are shown in
Figure 1G. To corroborate the varied PON1 expression
between SCC and adenocarcinoma, we analyzed a larger
dataset obtained from cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics
(http://cbioportal.org). A separate TCGA provisional
cohorts of lung SCC and adenocarcinoma samples show
higher amplification of DNA copy numbers in SCC with
truncating and missense (putative passenger) mutations
(Figure 1H). PON1 gene expression profiles were further
examined in public datasets from Oncomine database
(http://www.oncomine.org/) where we utilized a TCGA
lung cancer cohort showing normal versus cancer copy
number analysis. In the adenocarcinoma cohort, PON1 is
slightly amplified in general lung adenocarcinoma samples
(261 samples) and mixed subtype lung adenocarcinoma
(67 samples) but deleted in lung clear cell adenocarcinoma
(2 samples) and lung mucinous adenocarcinoma (6
samples) (Figure 1I, left panel). In the lung SCC cohort,
PON1 has relatively high amplification of DNA copy
numbers in all SCC variants (348 general SCC samples;
8 SCC, basaloid variant samples; 2 SCC, papillary variant
samples; 1 SCC small cell variant sample) compared to
both lung normal (no value) and the adenocarcinoma
cohort (Figure 1I, right panel). Similar patterns were
observed using other available LC cohort datasets
showing higher amplified copy numbers in SCC than in
adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Figure 1A, 1B, 1C). We
wondered whether this expression pattern in human tumors

We next examined how PON1 can possibly impact patient
outcome in annotated datasets of human NSCLC tumors.
Utilizing a published meta-analysis of LC microarray
datasets that assessed prognostic values of biomarkers
using transcriptomic data [12], we found that low PON1
expression in lung adenocarcinoma patients is correlated
with decreased overall survival while associated with
improved progression-free survival (Figure 1L). This
suggests that varied PON1 mRNA expressions across
LC subtypes may correlate with increased or decreased
metastatic frequency as survival data from the mined
cohorts is largely due to metastasis.
In cells, PON1 expression varied with high expression
in lung epithelial cell line L132 and in some LC cell lines

would persist in larger TCGA datasets. We examined
copy number variations for human PON1, which lies in
a broad region on chromosome 7q21.3 where a cluster
of three related paraoxonase genes are located. GISTIC
analysis reveals that PON1 has infrequent amplification
and deletion across the entire TumorScape/TCGA dataset
of 9,000+ tumors (http://www.broadinstitute.org/tcga/).
Although infrequent, we were able to observe higher
amplification frequency in SCC than adenocarcinoma and
higher deletion frequency in adenocarcinoma than SCC
(Figure 1J). Supporting this, we were able to observe
higher focal, specific amplification at the PON1 locus in
SCC than in adenocarcinoma (Figure 1K). These show
high PON1 variability patterns across different LC types.

A549 and H358, whereas PON1 expression was barely
detected in other LC cell lines, H460 and H1299, which
appeared, if any, as higher molecular weight form of
43 kDa (Figure 2A). PON1 appeared as double-band at
39 and 43 kDa with higher expression in the cytosol and
little or no expression in the nucleus of L132, A549 and
H358 cells, with major 39 kDa band in A549 and H358,
whereas a 43 kDa band appeared in L132 cells, both
dominantly in cytoplasm (Figure 2B). It is not reported
thus far the functional differences of 43 kDa and 39 kDa
PON1 proteins, although it is postulated that 43 kDa is a
glycosylated form and 39 kDa is not [13]. Protein function
depends on localization. Although it is suggested that
extracellular PON1 can be taken up to cell cytoplasm [14]
PON1 distribution was localized in the overlapping borders
of nuclear membrane in live A549 cells with likewise
condensed, granular pattern in nucleus and cytosol of H460
cells when forced to overexpress PON1 while more widely
scattered in the cytoplasm of L132 cells (Figure 2C). PON1
was significantly overexpressed by bicistronic lentiviral
vector-mediated stable transduction in H460 and H1299
cells as higher 43 kDa forms (Figure 2D; Supplementary
Figure 2A). A549 cells infected with lentivirus-encoding
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PON1 shRNA (A549-shPON1) appeared to have efficient
PON1 knockdown (compared to scrambled shRNA
control; shControl) with almost no protein expression, and
with >2-fold decrease in mRNA expression (Figure 2E;
Supplementary Figure 2B). PON1-overexpressing H460PON1 and H1299-PON1 cells have high PON1 secretion
while A549-shPON1 cells have very low secretion, all
displaying 39 kDa and 43 kDa forms (Figure 2F). We
observed both 39 kDa and 43 kDa forms of PON1 in the
secretion of A549, H460-PON1, and H1299-PON1 cells.

PON1 drives lung cancer cell growth, regulates
cell cycle progression, and supports senescence
blockade
Although it is suspected that antioxidative
function of PON1 contribute to cancer development,
it currently lacks detailed mechanism to prove such.
Knockdown of PON1 in A549-shPON1 cells displayed
robust decrease in proliferation rate overtime while
markedly increased when forcedly expressed in
H460-PON1 and H1299-PON1cells with less nuclear
condensation accompanied with enlarged nuclei size

under serum-starvation and pre-exposure to 90%
oxygen (Figure 3A; Supplementary Figure 2C). Colony
formation was dramatically increased in H460-PON1
and H1299-PON1 cells while reduced in A549-shPON1
cells (Figure 3B). We next assessed the probable
influence of PON1 regulation in cell cycle progression
using FACS. Both PON1-overexpressing cells were
≥27% in S phase and >49% in G1/G0 phase compared
with their controls (19-20% in S phase and 57-67% in
G1/G0), and thus decreasing the G1/S ratio approximately
>1.3 fold explaining the rapid proliferation, in contrast
with 8% lesser S phase and >9% greater G1/G0 fractions
when PON1 was knocked down causing cells to be
arrested within 3 days (Figure 3C). Supporting this
claim, PON1-overexpressing cells incorporated more
BrdU while obstructed when PON1 was suppressed
(Figure 3D; Supplementary Figure 4A, 4B). This
reinforces a causal possibility of PON1-inflicted
cellular senescence blockade. Thus, we tested whether
PON1 supports escape from senescence-defining
permanent growth arrest upon induction. To undermine
this process, we cultured the cells at low cell density in
serum-rich media and treated them with low etoposide
concentration (3 µM) at day 3, washed the cells at day 5,
starved them for another 4 to 6 days (serum-starvation;

pre-exposed to 90% oxygen) until we observed
proliferation arrest for at least 3 subsequent passages
and confirmed a cellular senescence phenotype by SAβ-gal activity (data not shown). PON1-overexpressing
cells maintained the growth pattern while control cells
dramatically decreased in proliferation, in contrast
with A549-shPON1 cells, which reached later passages
of 8 to 10 with diminishing proliferation rate (Figure
3E). Ensuring this senescence blockade, PON1overexpressing H460 cells displayed down-regulated
p21Waf1/Cip1, which triggers growth arrest associated
with senescence (Figure 3F; normalized band intensity
values in right panel), while not significantly affecting
p16α expression. Interestingly, under normal culture,
transient PON1 overexpression (by pCMV-GFP-PON1
transfection) up-regulated p16 and cyclin E gene levels
among others (Supplementary Figure 4A, 4B, 4C).

Antioxidative function of PON1 is maintained in
ROS-dependent manner
PON1 works as an antioxidant enzyme with HDLassociated macrophage differentiation regulatory activity
[14]. However, it is not well documented whether its
anti-oxidative function is maintained in cancers. To

define the antioxidative regulatory activity of PON1 in
LC, we first determined whether PON1 expression can be
regulated by oxidative stress and defined the regulatory
involvement of ROS in PON1-driven cell growth. PON1
internalization from the extracellular matrix (ECM) to
cellular compartment was potentially detected when
recombinant PON1-tagged with His (rPON1-His) was
admixed in the media. Despite the wild-type PON1
expression in both cells, we observed higher uptake of
rPON1-His in A549 cells than L132 cells (Figure 4A).
Interestingly, this uptake persisted upon H2O2-induced
oxidative stress in A549 cells but not in L132 cells
supporting that PON1 uptake can be an adaptive response
mechanism of cancer cells to oxidative stress (Figure
4B). To directly examine the consequence of rPON1-His
uptake from the media on cells, we allowed cells to be fed

with rPON1-enriched media for 24 h and subsequently
induced oxidative stress with increasing concentrations
of H2O2. Notably, there was a higher rescue frequency
of viability in A549 than L132 cells (Supplementary
Figure 5). Interested in ROS-directed promotion of Aktregulated response to oxidative stress, we detected a
recovery of ablated growth rate of A549-shPON1 cells
after treatment with an antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine
(NAC) while further inhibited when exposed to ROSstimulators, H2O2 and FeSO4 (Figure 4C). Reflecting
this functional input on mitochondrial dysfunction, we
observed that after loading with dihydrorhodamine 123
(DHR-123), the fluorescence output was suppressed in
A549-shPON1 cells while increased in H460-PON1 cells
(Figure 4D), suggesting PON1 exploits the energization
of oxidative stress supplied by mitochondria where

DHR-123 is concentrated upon conversion to rhodamine
123 (RHO-123), which appeared to have lower mean
fluorescent intensity (MIF) in response to PON1 loss
(Figure 4E), negatively regulating mitochondrial ROS
production but independent of ROS scavenging process
because upon inhibiting ROS scavenging activity by
CDNB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene), the same results
occurred (Supplementary Figure 6). Knockdown of
PON1 increased the MIF of dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA) while lowered when forcedly
overexpressed (Figure 4F, 4G). These findings argue
that while downregulation of PON1 enhances ROS
production reflecting PON1 to have antioxidant activity,
forced overexpression of PON1 can behave as both

prooxidant and antioxidant which might be dependent
on mitochondrial energization by removing superoxide
anion or generating hydrogen peroxide. Confirming this
hypothesis, PON1 knockdown caused a decrease in the
level of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria
to cytosol with elevated mitochondrial membrane
potential measured by TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine
ethyl ester), while overexpression caused an increase
(Figure 4H, 4I). Under brief treatment with Antimycin
A (AA), superoxide levels were diminished in PON1overexpressing cells (Figure 4J). PON1 knockdown
increased the staurosporine (STS)-mediated induction
of mitochondrial fragmentation, indicating an impeded
mitochondrial fusion affecting GTPase-related proteins at

ablation increasing Akt phosphorylation when ROS
is scavenged or decreased when stimulated. Recovery
of Akt phosphorylation in PON1-knockdown cells
was achieved when Akt and ROS were both inhibited
(Figure 5F, 5G). Given the role of Akt in the upregulation of the PON1 gene expression, this suggests
that PON1 positively impacts Akt-implicated metastatic
capacity [17].

6B) while no regulation was observed in L132 cells
(data not shown). PON1 overexpression negatively
regulated NAD+/NADPH levels with significant
decrease in production upon glucose-deprivation
compared to control wild-type cells while scant
PON1 in A549-shPON1 cells positively regulated
NAD+/NADPH levels with significant increase
upon glucose-deprivation compared to control cells
expressing wild-type PON1 (Figure 6C). Moreover,
PON1 overexpression suppressed glucose-deprivationinduced ROS production, while shPON1 reversed
this occurrence (Figure 6D). To further explain what
is driving this mechanism, we examined the possible
role of AMPK. AMPK mediates glycolysis in cancer
metabolism [19]. Glucose-starvation induced the
phosphorylation of AMPK-α in A549-shControl cells
while less expressed in A549-shPON1 cells with

PON1 supports escape from therapy-induced
apoptosis in lung cancer cells

scant Akt expression. Along with this, secretion of
PON1 appeared to be mediated by a glucose-directed
mechanism (Figure 6E). Thus, it is deducted that
glucose deprivation induces ROS that activates AMPK
by phosphorylation, which then increases PON1. The
elevated PON1 thus suppresses ROS in lung cancer.
These all together suggest that secretion of PON1 might
involve AMPK to direct the glycolysis-mediated action
affecting PON1 release and influence PON1-directed
antioxidative function.

We next tested the impact of PON1 overexpression
or knockdown on therapeutically induced LC cell death
using STS, 5-fluorouracil (5FU), paclitaxel (PTX),
cisplatin (CIS), and etoposide (ETOP). PON1 afforded
protection from drug-induced cell viability inhibition
(Figure 7A; H460 data in right panel and H1299 data
in left panel) and lesser sub-G1 population (Figure 7B).

as the loading control. Images and figures were selected as representative data from three independent experiments. Three independent

In addition, regulation of PON1 inflicted a difference in
the ratio of early (EA) and late apoptotic (LA) fractions
induced by PTX in LC cells with a decrease in EA with
subsequent significant decrease in LA fraction in PON1overexpressing cells (overall reduction in apoptotic
cells) while increase in EA in PON1 knocked down
cells (Figure 7C), supporting the data showing that loss
of PON1 increased STS-mediated ligand-induced cell
death with increased LA fraction (Supplementary Figure
9). Consistent with this, maintained nuclear morphology
was observed compared to control with either condensed
and/or fragmented nuclei after pre-exposure to drugs
(Figure 7D) with relatively less TUNEL-positive cells
revealed by incorporation to nuclei of dying LC cells
(Figure 7E). Corresponding to these events we turned to
the cell death pathway to examine probable mechanistic
consequences. In LC, however not necessary, induction
of p53-dependent extrinsic apoptosis causes disruption
of cross-talk interaction between Akt and ERK with cell
death-related signals and tumor suppressors [20], together
these crucial events represent a major pro-apoptotic

stimulus. PON1-overexpressing H460 and H1299 cells
had different regulation pattern in p53 phosphorylation,
which can be traced with the expression of different wildtype p53 status (Figure 7F). H460-PON1 abolished both
phospho- and total forms of p53, while it was null in
H1299-PON1 cells. H1299-PON1 dramatically decreased
total pro-caspase-3 and thus activated caspase-3, which
cleaves p21 CDKI. Under STS, an ATP-competitive kinase
inhibitor, we both found that there was an increase in the
clearance of abnormal, dying cell fraction and knockdown
of PON1 exacerbated this effect by increasing the fraction
of apoptosis induced by STS (Figure 7G). In support, ATP
levels were decreased in A549-shPON1 cells while ATP
production is preserved in PON1-overexpressing cells
even when stressed under STS (Figure 7H; Supplementary
Figure 10A). This finding relates PON1 activity to
extrinsic ligand-induced cell death since glycolytic
shifts mediate the binding of TNF ligands and TRAIL to
their respective death receptors [20]. Meanwhile, PON1
overexpression resulted in protection against ligandstimulated caspase-3/-7 activation in response to TNF-α,

TRAIL (not significant), and STS, however co-treatment
with the combination of the two with STS did not produce
any significant changes (Figure 7I, 7J; Supplementary
Figure 10B). This suggests that the involvement of TNF-α
and TRAIL in PON1-mediated escape from apoptosis is
caspase-independent while STS works through a caspasedirected mechanism. In light of this, we also found a
significant rescue of apoptotic fraction induced by STS
in glucose-deprived H460-PON1 cells (Supplementary
Figure 11). We next examined the effect of PON1 on
CHOP expression involved in PON2/PON3-regulated
ER-stressed triggered activation [21] in transient PON1overexpressing cells. PON1 caused 1.4 fold downregulation of CHOP mRNA, and attenuated the increase
of STS-induced JNK mRNA (Supplementary Figure
12). Further, PON1-overexpressing H460-PON1 cells
resulted in decreased p53 activation after treatment with
either ETOP or STS with subsequent down-regulation of
caspase-3 and -8, p27, and p21, while PON1 deficiency
increased p53 and caspase-activation A549-shPON1 cells
(Figure 7K). This supports the down-regulation of the
endogenous phosphorylated p53 expression in PON1overexpressing H460 cells, coordinating the p53 cell death
pathway to defend cells from genotoxic and apoptotic
damages induced by ETOP and STS, respectively.

oxidative stress with functional consequences in LC
tumor physiology, metastatic potential, and cell death.
This also collectively suggests that LC might potentially
exploit the antioxidative function of PON1 to benefit
cancer cell growth and survival. Phenotypes observed
from gain and loss of PON1 function and expression in
LC cells, both at the gene and protein stability levels,
also help provide a clear and direct basis for previously
identified risk factor associations and polymorphisms
for PON1 and their implication in response to oxidative
stress across LC subtypes [24, 25]. Our unbiased analyses
additionally highlighted PON1 as a potential driver of LC
carcinogenesis by inducing outgrowth and invasive ability
through its paracrine and cell-autonomous antioxidative
function regulating adaptive response to therapyinduced apoptosis. Functional assays also suggest that
this regulatory observation is an oncoprotein phenotype
specific to LC cells.
In our previous efforts in studying the implication of
PON1 in LC, we recently discovered that serum PON1 is
a highly significant meta-marker, along with SERPINA4,
for the differential diagnosis of LC and lung disease
[26]. More notably, our previous integrated proteomicsbased analysis of serum PON1 utilizing a wide-range
of patient serum samples diagnosed with different LC
sub-types indicated that the PTM glycosylation of
PON1 in form of fucosylated PON1 is a highly specific
biomarker for the diagnosis of SCLC [13]. How do these
previous serum PON1 biomarker data fit with the tissue
expression of PON1 across LC sub-types? Interestingly,
we identified in this study that there is a varied PON1
protein expression pattern between our cohorts of SCC
and lung adenocarcinoma patient tissue samples matched
with adjacent normal tissues. Although minimal in
protein overexpression, PON1 is expressed in SCC while
infrequently deleted in lung adenocarcinoma. However,
due to the limited number of LC patient tissues tested,
we further aimed to substantiate this observation by
bioinformatics analysis of PON1 copy numbers from
publicly available datasets. Mining several meta-analyses
of oncogenomic/transcriptomic datasets derived from
the TCGA databases, we found a higher frequency of
differential gene expression (copy numbers) of PON1
between SCC and lung adenocarcinoma cohorts across all
variants per subtype. In a broad context, higher amplified
copy numbers of PON1 were detected in SCC than lung
adenocarcinoma cohorts while infrequent, higher deletion
frequency in lung adenocarcinoma than SCC cohorts. One
can consider the possibility that depending on LC subtype,
cells might inhibit the secretion of PON1 protein from
the liver cells to the blood, as in our previous study [13],
we found an overall reduction of serum PON1 levels in
both mouse models and SCLC patients despite dramatic
fucosylation levels of the protein, which in this form can
persist longer in the blood due to reduced proteolytic
degradation. Nonetheless, future studies will be aimed at

PON1 contributes to tumor growth in vivo
Association of PON1 to tumor development has
been limited to the occurrence of its non-synonymous gene
polymorphisms in cancer patients [22, 23]. To address the
role of PON1 on tumorigenesis in vivo, we subcutaneously
injected H460-PON1, H1299-PON1, A549-shPON1 cells,
and vector control cells suspended in Matrigel into the
upper and lower right and left flanks of nude mice. This
subcutaneous mouse xenograft experiment demonstrated
that all mice (n = 4/4 per group; 16 tumors) injected with
control and PON1-modified cells had multiple bilateral
subcutaneous tumors within 35-37 days of inoculation,
whereas no mice that were injected with PBS only showed
signs of any tumor growth (n = 4; 8 sites). Tumors were
assessed by caliper to measure the size and confirmed by
H&E staining (Figure 8A, 8B, 8C). Condensed structure
and greater tumor masses were observed in both PON1overexpressing tumors while smaller size tumors with
more spatial mass of cells were observed in PON1knockdown A549 tumors. These results indicate that the
abovementioned antioxidative, proliferative, and antiapoptotic effects of PON1 might systematically act as
mechanisms for tumor growth.

In this study, we identified notable LC cellautonomous function for PON1 providing evidence
of regulating the response mechanism of LC cells to

identifying the biological relevance of this varied PON1
expression across LC subtypes using patient-derived
animal models and cells to better define the implication of
dramatic PON1 expression changes and its PTMs and their
implication on the pathobiology of LC.
In other malignancies, PON1 being part of an
endogenous free radical scavenging system has been
observed to be a regulator of its expression and risk factor
value in various human cancers of the endometrium,
ovary, stomach, and pancreas [27, 28, 29, 30]. In addition,
decreased homozygote Q allelic PON1 activity has been
observed in breast cancers while M and Q alleles of PON1
have been regarded as high susceptibility risk factors [31,
32]. However, explicit reporting of the cancer-causing
mechanism of PON1 in these cancers has not yet been
elucidated despite these associations.
Molecularly, PON1 is released by a high-affinity
desorption mechanism and malignancies take advantage of
its regulating effects on systemic oxidative-stress to affect
tumor development with specific actions in the elimination
of lipid-soluble radicals from lipid peroxidation [33, 34].
Most probably, this is presumed to be accomplished by a
consequence of its antioxidative function. It also seems
plausible to relate PON1 function with PON2 and PON3
since recent studies have demonstrated their localization
in various cancer cells and tissues and found to regulate
mitochondrial cell death. Located adjacent to one another
in a cluster on the long arm of human chromosome 7 and
mouse chromosome 6, it is known that the three PONs
have a high similarity. Among other PONs, PON1 is most
known to have a dual-functioning system, hydrolytic and
antioxidative functions, which can be pointed out why
PON1 is a risk factor in various diseases. From this, it is
worth examining if cancer cells have ways to scavenge
serum PON1 and take advantage of its known metabolic
functions such as antioxidative and anti-inflammatory
effects. Such postulation can be generally supported
by studies currently linking PON1 genotypes to lung,
endometrial, ovarian, gastric, and pancreatic cancers
[35, 36].
Factors have been described that are able
to modulate PON1 gene expression such as some
interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-α, explaining the
anti-inflammatory effects induced by the enzyme in some
disease contexts including cancer. Intriguing evidence
has related smoking activity with decreased serum
paraoxonase activity causing a presumption on low-level
expression of PON1 in the serum of SCLC patients. Such
events prove that simple knowledge about the PON1
genetic variants cannot possibly be sufficient to reveal the
relationship of the previously described PON1 variants to
cancer risk [37].
Lines of evidence indicate that PON1 uptake in
macrophages is mediated by specific binding sites with
HDL which is able to suppress this event and can further
be regulated by apolipoprotein A-1 [38]. However,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

differential processing of fucosylated and non-fucosylated
PON1 uptake in any cell type has never been described
before. It still needs to be tested which form of PON1 has
antioxidative and anti-inflammatory function. Meanwhile,
it is reported that reduced expression of the scavenger
receptor B-I (SR-BI) is correlated with decreased
PON1 activity and increased oxidative stress in mice
with less apoptotic-protection as a consequence [39]. It
is yet to be determined whether scavenger receptors
deregulate the uptake of PON1 from the circulation. Our
study raises a stirring possibility on the significance of
identifying critical effectors in supporting speculations
such as that LC cells uptake PON1 from the blood
through its HDL-associated mechanism to benefit tumor
growth and metabolism via its antioxidative function.
Such presuppositions still need to be tested by further
experiments. Interestingly, differential effects on H460PON1 and H1299-PON1 overexpressing cells have been
seen in the regulation of p53 and cell death-related signals
which further explains why functional action in druginduced apoptosis were different. This might be due to
different wt-p53 status in these NSCLC cell lines.
A future study addressing the mechanism on how
PON1 is differentially synthesized in LC subtypes may
employ the need to utilize animal models with high
expression of transgenic PON1 and PON1-knockout
animals as the same can also be suggested to the other
PONs, PON2 and PON3, to complete the role of PONs in
cancer development although these future strategies may
undergo limitations and demand cautious confirmation and
further related evidence because of the high probability
of PON1 as well as other PONs expression being
differentially regulated in the tissues of healthy humans
and cancer patients.

were performed according to the protocols approved by the
institutional animal care and use committee at the College
of Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University.

For establishing the stable knockdown of PON1,
A549 cells were transfected with mouse pLKO.1-puro
or pLKO.1 lentiviral based vector encoding shRNA
constructs derived from the Broad Institute TRC1 library:
pLKO.1-puro-shPON1 (clone IDs TRCN0000050360,
TRCN0000050358). pLKO.1-Puro-shControl was used
as described previously [40]. All retroviral vectors
were purchased from Origene, (Rockville, USA). The
respective oligo constructs were cloned in AgeI, EcoRI
sites of pLKO.1 with hairpin. DNA oligos were obtained
from Open Biosystems (Thermo Scientific). Each shRNAencoding vector was transfected in triplicate wells. One
well was kept untreated, one with 4.5 μg/mL puromycin,
and one with 0.01% DMSO. Surviving fraction of cells
that were pre-exposed to puromycin were maintained in
0.1 μg/mL puromycin containing growth media. Cells
were harvested on ice in 1x PBS and the samples were
prepared for RT-qPCR analysis. Relative changes of PON1
mRNA expression compared to the unstimulated pLKO.1
control were normalized to the expression of hGAPDH
and quantified using the 2-ΔΔCt method. For establishing the
stable PON1 overexpressing cells, H460 and H1299 cells
were transfected with bicistronic pLVX-EF1α-IRES-puro
lentiviral expression vector (Clontech, Mountain View,
CA) to simultaneously coexpress the human PON1 single
mRNA transcript. The same process as described above
was used for the stable transduced maintenance of masspopulations of puromycin-resistant cells highly expressing
PON1. An unstimulated empty vector control was used as
experimental control. The human PON1 protein level in
stable PON1 knockdown and overexpressing cells were
later confirmed by Western blotting.

Clinical human samples
A total of 39 pairs of tissue samples from LC
patients with lung adenocarcinoma and SCC were
obtained during surgery through resection of primary
tumors. In addition, we employed 164 pairs of matched
tissue and serum samples from LC patients with further
disease-type classification (as limited and extensive
disease stages of SCLC, adenocarcinoma, squamous
and large cell carcinomas) described in our previous
study [13]. After securing written informed consent, all
patient samples were obtained and used in accordance
with the institutional ethical guidelines of Seoul National
University Bundang Hospital (IRB No. B-1201/143003). All clinical samples were selected and categorized
randomly from a large sample bank and the mentioned
affiliate institution approved all protocols/methods adapted
in this study utilizing the clinical samples. Preoperative
chemotherapy was not conducted on all patients who
participated. All tissue samples were classified as having
LC (lung SCC or lung adenocarcinoma) or adjacent
normal tissue.

Bioinformatics
Initial query of PON1 mRNA expression in human
LC datasets was performed using Lung Cancer Explorer
(UTSW QBRC/CCBSR; http://lce.biohpc.swmed.edu/
lungcancer/). Oncoprints detailing genetic alterations
and their association with PON1 mRNA expression in
represented TCGA datasets were obtained from cBio
Portal. LC-specific PON1 copy number analysis utilizing
TCGA cohorts was done using Oncomine (see Results
section). Genomic data and profile graphs were obtained
using Affymetrix gene probe-set ID number for PON1 on
the given array platform. Confirmation of queried PON1
copy number alterations was analyzed by mapping PON1
copy numbers using TumorScape platform encompassing
TCGA databases (Broad Institute; www.broadinstitute.
org/tcga). The Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV, Broad
Institute) was used to determine the minimal common
region and to subsequently sort the samples by both
amplification and deletion of PON1, and then defined
smallest amplification or deletion that encompassed the
PON1 locus. The correlation of PON1 gene expression
levels to patient survival lung adenocarcinoma patients
was done using the KMplotter (http://kmplot.com).
Patients were split by median PON1 expression and
analysis was performed using the lung adenocarcinoma
dataset irrespective of grade, stage, and treatment regimen.
Both the overall survival and progression-free survival
were analyzed.

potential were assessed using the fluorescent potentiometric
dye TMRE, which works by entering the cell in the form of
an ester which is subsequently hydrolyzed and converted
to tetramethylrhodamine, which is reversibly accumulated
in the negatively charged mitochondrial matrix depending
on mitochondrial transmembrane potential exhibiting
potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria. Δѱm
was analyzed using a previously described method [44].
Cells were washed with cold PBS and 100 nM TMRE dye

centrifuged, and harvested with cold PBS and were
subjected to FACS analysis. Homogenous concentration of
NADP+/NADPH based on glucose-dehydrogenase cycling
reaction and ratios in cells was determined by following the
manufacturer’s protocol instructions (Abnova).

Total RNa was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was
treated with DNA I (New England Biolabs, MA). cDNA
amplification was performed using the High Capacity
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Realtime (RT)-PCR, and quantitative reverse transcriptase
RT-PCR were performed as described previously [43] to
evaluate mRNA levels of genes of interest. qPCR primer
sequences were designed using Primer 3 MIT software
and sequences were chosen that spanned exon junctions.
All sequences used are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

was carried out by quantification of the sub-G1 fraction
of cells, annexin-V-FITC/PI or 7-AAD staining analyzed
by FACS, and TUNEL assay, all as described previously
[41, 42, 44]. Cell cycle progression analysis was done by
fluorescence-cell activation sorting using FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

Glucose modification in cells
Adherent cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 in
high-glucose medium and medium was replaced after
48 h with glucose-deprivation medium, which was
depleted of glucose (0 mM glucose, Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY) after washing with glucose-deprived

determined by measuring the tumor size. All mice were
mercifully killed at day 35 and the tumors were removed
and scaled. Tumorigenicity experiments were performed
as described before [13, 45]. Tumors tissues were washed
with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies. For IHC, 4 µM
thick sections were cut from formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissues. Staining was carried out using H&E
staining according to the protocol provided by the
manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics).

For the assessment of intracellular ROS, cells grown
in 60 mm dishes were trypsinized, resuspended in growth
media, pelleted (300 × g, 20°C, 5 min), and stained with
20 to 40 μM DCFH-DA (Sigma) for 40 min at 37°C, recentrifuged, washed with cold PBS twice and fixed with
2% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were subjected to flow
cytometry analysis using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).
For the detection of mitochondrial cytochrome c release,
a previously described method was adapted [21]. Briefly,
cells were grown in 12-well dishes, trypsinized, pelleted
(350 × g, 4°C, 5 min) in growth media, washed with cold
PBS and re-centrifuged followed by immediate washing
with cold wash buffer (PBS, 1% FCS, 0.1%. Na-Azide;
all from Sigma) and fixed in cold PBS containing 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min in 4°C. Fixed cells were
washed, pelleted, and permeabilized/blocked with cold PBS
containing 0.2% saponin (Sigma) and MOPC-21 mouseIgG1κ (Sigma; with 1:10 ratio) for 5 min at RT. Cells
were then incubated with mouse-anti-cytochrome c (clone
7H8.2C12; BD Biosciences; 1:20 in PBS; 20 min; 4°C)
and conjugated with secondary antibody (AlexaFluor-647
goat anti-mouse IgG2b; Molecular Probes; 1:40 in PBS; 20
min; 4°C), washed twice, and resuspend with 100 μl 4%

Software and statistical analysis
Densitometry data from expression studies were
statistically analyzed using non-parametric KruskalWallis test. β-actin variations apparent in some blots
were considered when calculating for densitometric
values used for sample normalization. All analyses
were performed using OriginPro 8.0 (OriginLab Corp.)
and p values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. All results were obtained from at least three
42832

independent experiments and most were biologically
replicated. The data are presented as mean ± SD.
Statistical evaluation was done using one-/two-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons
post-test and Student’s t test and x2 test. GraphPad
Prism 5.01 software was used to calculate the MFI
of all fluorescence images. For image analysis, the
extent of apoptosis quantification by TUNEL assay
and DAPI fluorescence studies were quantified with
the aid of open-source image processing program
ImageJ and software plugins (NIH). To quantify nuclei
condensation and size, the probability density function
was calculated by analyzing the pixel per pixel value of
the acquired image of DAPI-stained nuclei and results
were displayed as Maple distribution using Maplesoft
(Waterloo Maple Inc., ON, Canada). Other methods not
listed here are detailed in Supplementary Methods.
