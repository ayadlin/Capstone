BACKGROUND: Chemoprevention is a potentially attractive strategy for decreasing the burden of colorectal cancer
(CRC). Preclinical studies suggest that bisphosphonates (BPs) may have direct antitumour effects against CRC. The
objective of this study was to determine the effect of exposure to BPs on the incidence of CRC. METHODS: The Manitoba Cancer Registry was used to identify patients who were diagnosed with CRC from 2000 to 2009 who had
been living in Manitoba for at least 5 years before diagnosis (cases). Each case was matched to 10 controls of similar
age, sex, and duration of residence in Manitoba using incidence density sampling. Exposure to BPs was determined
using the provincial Drug Program Information Network database. Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of exposure to BPs on CRC incidence with adjustment for health care use, medical procedures (including lower gastrointestinal endoscopy), socioeconomic status, and pre-existing health conditions.
RESULTS: In total, 5425 patients with CRC were matched to 54,242 controls. In the multivariate analysis, exposure to
BPs was associated with a reduction in the risk of CRC (2-13 BP prescriptions over 5 years: odds ratio [OR] 0.84; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.00; 14 BP prescriptions over 5 years: OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.94). When the effect of
specific BP agents was evaluated, the effect was significant only for exposure to risedronic acid (OR, 0.50; 95% CI,
0.30-0.85). There was no significant effect of increasing duration or cumulative dose of alendronic acid. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggested that exposure to BPs, especially risedronic acid, may be associated

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths and premature
mortality in North America.1 A recent reduction in age-standardized CRC incidence has been attributed to the increased
use of lower gastrointestinal endoscopies and associated removal of precancerous polyps.2 However, a large proportion of
the population is not undergoing CRC screening.3 Moreover, because the population is aging, the number of new CRC
cases diagnosed each year can be expected to continue to increase over the next several decades if the current trends continue unchanged.1
A potential alternative strategy to reducing CRC incidence would be the use of pharmaceutical agents to prevent
CRC development (chemoprevention). The slow and long natural history of development of CRC provides a window of
opportunity for implementing effective chemopreventive strategies. Chemopreventive agents may act in the preclinical
phase and reduce the risk of CRC or delay the development of CRC by suppressing the growth of cancer cells or their precursors. Although several chemopreventive agents for CRC have been studied, none is currently recommended for use.4
Bisphosphonates (BPs) are prescribed increasingly for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis.5 Bisphosphonates also have been used to treat individuals with bony metastasis from various cancers, including CRC.6 Experimental
studies suggest that BPs also have direct antitumor effects.7 Preclinical studies suggest that BPs can inhibit angiogenesis,

invasion and adhesion of tumor cells, and overall tumor
progression and can stimulate adoptive and innate immunity.8 Recently, reduced proliferation and induction of
apoptosis of colon cancer cells has been demonstrated.9,10
In an experimental model of ulcerative colitis, BP therapy
reportedly inhibited colorectal carcinogenesis.11 We evaluated the effect of BPs on the risk of CRC using Manitoba’s population-based databases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
This population-based, nested case-control study was performed by linking a set of administrative databases maintained by Manitoba Health (MH) and a provincial cancer
registry maintained by CancerCare Manitoba. MH is the
government agency that provides universal health care in
the province with no copayments, premiums, or deductibles. MH databases can be linked using scrambled unique
personal health identification numbers (PHINs), which
protect patient anonymity. Since 1984, every permanent
resident of Manitoba has been assigned a PHIN by MH.
The MH population registry is the client registry for
Manitoba permanent residents. It contains demographic
information, vital statistics, and migration status for the
publicly funded health care plan. This database was used
to identify the source population (cohort) for the study.
Cancer diagnosis was determined by record linkage using
the unique identifier (PHIN) with the Manitoba Cancer
Registry (MCR), a population-based database recording all
cancers diagnosed in residents of the province since 1956.
It has been demonstrated consistently that the MCR is of
high quality, including very high levels of reporting completeness and histologic verification.12
The MH Drug Program Information Network
(DPIN) is a comprehensive database of all out of hospital
prescriptions dispensed in Manitoba. It was used to identify
exposure to the study drugs. The DPIN was established in
1995. Each record in the DPIN database contains the date
of dispensation, a Health Canada-assigned drug identification number of the active ingredient, the strength, the
route, the number of doses provided, the anticipated duration of the prescription in days, and a code for the prescribing physician and the dispensing pharmacy.
The MH clinician billing claims and hospital
discharges administrative databases were used to identify
various potentially confounding health conditions (diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], coronary heart
disease [CHD], and comorbidity) and procedures (lower

gastrointestinal endoscopies and resective colorectal surgery) that can alter the risk of CRC. The health conditions
were identified using previously validated algorithms
based on administrative databases.13-15 Ambulatory care
visits with physicians also were identified from the billing
claims database.
Cases and controls were identified from the cohort
of Manitoba residents who lived in the province between
April 1, 2000 and March 31, 2009. Cases had to be aged
50 years at diagnosis. Their date of CRC diagnosis was
considered the index date. Incidence density (risk set) sampling was performed to select 10 controls per case. Cases and
controls were matched on age at index date, sex, and length
of stay in the province. Controls’ index date was the date of
the matching cases’ date of CRC diagnosis. Cases and controls were excluded if they had history of any invasive cancer
before the index date or if they were covered for <5 years by
MH before the index date. This lead in time allowed us to
determine the history of drug exposure, procedures, and
medical conditions before the diagnosis of CRC.
Exposure to BPs was defined as dispensation of 2 or
more prescriptions before the index date. The risk for
CRC among the individuals who were exposed to only 1
prescription was very similar to that of nonexposed individuals; therefore, those with exposure to only 1 prescription were aggregated with those who were not dispensed
any prescription for BPs. Individuals who were exposed to
BPs were categorized into 2 groups based on the median
number of prescriptions dispensed (14 prescriptions).
To assess the effect of exposure to specific BP agents,
analyses were repeated separately after categorizing the
study participants into those who received 2 or more prescriptions of each of the common agents (alendronic acid,
etidronic acid, risedronic acid) and those who received
multiple agents. The reference group in all these analyses
was comprised of participants who received 1 or less prescription for any of the BPs (reference group in the study).
Dose and duration analyses were performed for
alendronic acid only, because it was the most commonly
prescribed BP (Table 1). Duration was measured (in days)
as the sum of days supplied listed in each of the prescriptions. The study participants were then categorized
according to quartiles of duration of use of alendronic
acid. Similarly, the cumulative dose (in grams) of alendronic acid dispensed was determined by summing the
total amount dispensed, calculated as the product of
strength and number of doses provided for each prescription. The study participants were then categorized according to quartiles of cumulative doses of alendronic acid.

Potential Confounders
The potential confounders that we evaluated included
various health conditions (diabetes, IBD, CHD, and
comorbidity) and procedures (lower gastrointestinal endoscopies and resective colorectal surgery). All of the diagnoses
and procedures had to have occurred at least 6 months
before the index date. The use of lower gastrointestinal
endoscopies was assessed from 6 months to 5 years before
the index date. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)
score was determined from all hospital admissions in the 5
years before the CRC diagnosis using a previously validated
algorithm.16,17 CRC diagnoses were excluded from the
CCI calculations. Individuals were categorized into those
with a score of 0 and no prior hospital admission, those
with a score of 0 and a history of hospital admission, and
those with a score 1. We also adjusted for the total number of ambulatory care visits to physicians in the 5 years preceding the index date; this was used to minimize detection
bias caused by BP users accessing the health care system
more frequently. In addition, we controlled for exposure to
use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) (in women), because
these agents can lower the risk of CRC. We used the same
exposure definition for NSAIDs and HRT that we used for
BPs. Although we did not have direct access to the lifestyle
factors that can influence the risk of CRC, we adjusted for
socioeconomic status (SES), which has been strongly correlated with many lifestyle factors in previous studies18-20 and
can be a predictor of CRC diagnosis.21 The SES was
assigned based on the neighborhood of residence using the
neighborhood-based Socioeconomic Factor Index (SEFI), a
previously validated measure.22,23 CHD has lifestyle risk
factors similar to those for CRC; therefore, CHD also was
used to perform adjustment for lifestyle risk factors.
Statistical Analysis
Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed
to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence

1238

intervals (CIs) for the association between BP use and
CRC. Because of the incidence density sampling, these
ORs are unbiased estimates of the incidence risk ratios. The
use of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was included a priori in the multivariate models as a marker of screening for
CRC. Other potential confounders were retained in the
multivariate models if they resulted in a change 2% in
the crude ORs of the principal exposure (use of BPs).
Among the CRC cases diagnosed between 2004 and
2009 (MCR has routinely recorded stage for cancers diagnosed in 2004 and later), we performed unconditional
logistic regression analysis to determine the effect of exposure to BPs on stage at diagnosis (stage III/IV vs stage I/
II). For this analysis, age, sex, and the use of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy were included a priori in the multivariate models; other potential confounders were retained
in the multivariate models if they resulted in a change
2% in the crude ORs of the principal exposure (exposure to BPs).
SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used
for data management and analyses. This study was
approved by the University of Manitoba Health Research
Ethics Board, the MH Health Information and Privacy
Committee, and CancerCare Manitoba’s Research
Resource Impact Committee.

RESULTS
In total, 5425 patients with CRC (cases) were matched to
a group of 54,242 controls. Forty-six percent of cases were
females. The characteristics of cases and controls are provided in Table 2. Cases with CRC were less likely to be
exposed to NSAIDs and HRT (among women); had
received fewer lower gastrointestinal endoscopies; and were
more likely to have diabetes, IBD, and CHD. Only 1.3%
of men were exposed to 2 prescriptions of BPs. In contrast, approximately 12% of women were exposed to 2
prescriptions of BPs.
The number of ambulatory care physician visits,
previous exposure to NSAIDs, and CCI score altered the
ORs of association between exposure to BPs and CRC by
>2%. These variables were included in the final multivariate model along with history of prior exposure to lower
gastrointestinal endoscopy (which was included a priori).
The multivariate model also included adjustment for
matching covariates.
In the multivariate model, exposure to BPs was associated inversely with a CRC diagnosis (2-13 BP prescriptions: OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-1.00; 14 BP

much smaller number of exposed cases). It was not possible to measure the association with exposure to risedronic
acid among men, because there were no men with CRC
with exposure to risedronic acid. For similar reasons, the
sex-stratified analysis for dose and duration of BPs was
performed only for women (Table 5). On stratification
for site of CRC (proximal vs distal CRC, with proximal
CRC defined as CRC at or proximal to the splenic flexure
and distal CRC in the rest of the colon), there was a stronger inverse association of exposure to BPs with a diagnosis
of distal CRC (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we observed a 16% reduction in the risk of
CRC with exposure to 2 to 13 BP prescriptions and a
22% reduction in the risk of CRC with exposure to 14
BP prescriptions. Among individual agents, the receipt of
2 prescriptions of risedronic acid was associated with a
significant reduction in the risk of CRC.
Two previous studies have reported the effect of BP
use on the risk of CRC. A study from the United Kingdom that relied on prescriptions written by health care
providers (rather than prescriptions dispensed) indicated

Dose and duration analyses were not performed for men alone because of the limited use of bisphosphonates among men. The analysis was adjusted for
age, sex, duration of coverage with Manitoba Health, history of previous exposure to lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, number of previous ambulatory care
physician visits, previous exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score.

The analysis was adjusted for sex, age (categorized as ages 50-59 years, 60-69 years, 70-79 years, and 80 years), socioeconomic status-Socioeconomic
Factor Index, number of ambulatory care physician visits, prior exposure to lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and history
of coronary heart disease. Note that similar results were obtained when the risk of stage IV disease alone was estimated (data not shown). In addition, this
analysis was restricted to individuals who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2004 and 2009, because the Manitoba Cancer Registry started recording stage of colorectal cancer for cases diagnosed in 2004.

a borderline nonsignificant reduction in the risk of CRC
with the use of BPs (relative risk, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.771.00] for 1 prescription; relative risk, 0.82 [95% CI,
0.67-1.00] for 10 prescriptions).24 It is noteworthy that
the magnitude of association in the United Kingdom
study was similar to that in our study. There was an overall
lower use of BPs in that study (3%) compared with our
study (6%), which may have had an impact on the
strength of the association. Although the United Kingdom study adjusted their analysis for lifestyle risk factors,
such as smoking, alcohol intake, and body mass index,
there was no adjustment for other potential confounding
factors, such as the use of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy
and the frequency of health care visits, factors that were
considered in our study. In addition, by considering pre-

Cancer

scriptions written rather than dispensed, the drug use may
have been misclassified because of unfilled and lost prescriptions. The second study, a large case-control study
from northern Israel, reported a 50% reduction in the risk
of CRC with use of BPs for >1 year (OR, 0.50; 95% CI,
0.35-71).25 Similar to the United Kingdom study, the Israeli study also indicated that the inclusion of lifestyle risk
factors in the analysis did not alter the association between
BP use and the risk of CRC. However, that study also did
not consider the potential confounding effect of increased
health system contact among BPs users. In the current
study, we expanded the analysis by examining the effect of
BPs according to sex, stage of CRC, and specific BP agents
with adjustment for contact with the health care system,
including the use of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. We

did not observe any effect of BPs on stage of CRC at diagnosis—BPs may be able to prevent the development of
CRC rather than to prevent the growth or spread of established tumors.
Although we report that the risk of CRC was
reduced by approximately 50% with exposure to risedronic acid, this finding needs to be confirmed in additional studies. If corroborated in other studies, this may
indicate that risedronic acid could be considered as an
agent of choice when BPs are prescribed for osteoporosis
to individuals who also have a higher risk of CRC (eg, a
family history of CRC or a personal past history of colorectal polyps or CRC). There are structural differences
between the different BPs.26,27 BPs can be classified into 2
groups based on the structure of R2 side chains. Nitrogencontaining BPs (N-BPs) (eg, alendronic acid, risedronic
acid, zoledronic acid) are much more potent with regard
to their bone antiresorptive activity than the nonnitrogen-containing BPs (eg, etidronic acid). Among the
N-BPs, those with a tertiary nitrogen in a ring structure
(hetrocyclic N-BPs; eg, risedronic acid and zoledronic
acid) are more similar to each other structurally and have
the highest potency. In addition, the N-BPs, such as risedronic acid and zoledronic acid, inhibit the mevalonate
pathway (ie, the cholesterol synthesis pathway) and induce
caspase activity.28 Among all BPs, hetrocyclic N-BPs, like
risedronic acid and zoledronic acid, are the strongest inhibitors of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, which is a key
branch-point enzyme in the mevalonate pathway,26 an effect
that may explain at least in part their anticancer effect.8 Zoledronic acid is the BP that has been evaluated most extensively in vitro for its antitumor activity, including its effect
on colon cancer cells.28 Risedronic acid, the agent we identified as the most effective at reducing CRC risk, has similarities with zoledronic acid in structure and cellular effect.
The risk:benefit ratio of using BPs should be considered by current and potential future users. The serious
side effects of BPs are rare. For example, osteonecrosis of
the jaw has been reported most commonly among longterm users of intravenous BPs.29,30 If the results from our
study are confirmed by others, then the benefits of using
BPs may outweigh the risks, especially for individuals
with a higher risk of CRC. However, thorough risk:benefit and cost-effectiveness assessments will be necessary.
Because of the few reports of serious side effects related to
BPs, it has become important to document all potential benefits of BPs to better inform BP users. Additional studies are
needed to confirm the effect of BPs on the risk for different
cancers. In a recent study, the receipt of BPs was associated
with a small absolute increased risk of esophageal cancer24;

1242

however, another study using the same database reported no
effect of BPs on the risk of esophageal cancers.31
The current investigation has strengths and limitations. The databases that we used were validated previously as relatively robust. Manitoba has several
administrative and diagnostic databases that can be linked
to the provincial pharmacy database. This wide range of
information permitted adjustment for several potential
confounding factors, including increased endoscopy use
among individuals who are receiving certain medications.32 Cancer information in the MCR is highly accurate, because cancer registrars review and confirm all
information. BPs were approved for use in Canada in the
middle 1990s; therefore, it is anticipated that the DPIN,
which was created in 1995, captured most use of BPs in
Manitoba. Our study design reduced the potential for
recall bias in terms of exposure to BPs and potential confounding factors by using prerecorded exposure histories.
The use of population-based data sources limited the
potential for selection bias. Although we did not have information on lifestyle risk factors for CRC, adjustment
for lifestyle risk factors in the 2 previous studies discussed
above did not alter the effect of exposure to BPs on the
risk of CRC.24,25 We included SES in our analyses,
because SES has been correlated strongly with lifestyle risk
factors in previous studies.18-20 In addition, we adjusted
for CHD, which has lifestyle risk factors similar to those
for CRC. We did not have information on over-the-counter use of medications, calcium supplementation, or vitamin D. BPs and HRT are available only by prescription in
Canada, and previous studies indicate that most chronic
NSAID use is by prescription.33,34 The effect of vitamin
D on CRC needs to be established; in contrast to some
other studies, a recent study that was adjusted for the
impact of seasonal variations indicated no protective effect
of vitamin D on the risk for CRC.35 On the basis of conflicting results from several studies, the US Food and
Drug Administration recently concluded that the evidence was inconclusive for calcium supplementation
reducing the risk of CRC.36 Because of the smaller number of individuals on risedronic acid, we were unable to
study its dose or duration effect or its effect among men.
Our study was an observational study, and this kind of
study design is prone to confounding by unmeasured or
unknown potential confounding factors. Finally, it is possible that there are confounding factors that reduce the
risk of CRC and predispose to osteoporosis (and, hence,
BP use) that we have not accounted for, such as body mass
index. In this regard, however, the other 2 studies indicated that body mass index did not affect the inverse

association between BP use and risk of CRC. The association of reduced risk of CRC with BP use warrants further
exploration epidemiologically and biologically.
In conclusion, the current study results suggest that
exposure to BPs, and particularly to risedronic acid, may
reduce the risk of presenting with CRC. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine
the cost-benefit ratio for the use of BPs, a class of agents
commonly used in the elderly, which comprise a population at risk for both osteoporosis and CRC.
