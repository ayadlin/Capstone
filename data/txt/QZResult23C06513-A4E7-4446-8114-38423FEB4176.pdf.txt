Abstract:

Advanced gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies are varied in presentation, prognosis,
and treatment options. With the exception of resectable recurrent colorectal cancer,
metastatic GI malignancies are incurable. Cytotoxic chemotherapies have been the
mainstay of therapy for decades but limited extension of survival or clinical benefit
has been achieved in non-colorectal GI cancers. There has been great interest in the
incorporation of antiangiogenic strategies to improve outcomes for these patients.
Clear benefits have been identified with bevacizumab and sorafenib in colorectal cancer
and hepatocellular cancer, respectively; other GI tumor sites have lacked impressive
results with antiangiogenic agents. In this review, we will present the benefits, or
lack thereof, of clinically tested antiangiogenic compounds in GI malignancies and
explore some potential new therapeutic anti-angiogenesis options for these diseases.

INTRODUCTION

blocking this pathway via inhibition of the ligand (VEGF),
the receptors (VEGFRs), and the effector intracellular
tyrosine kinase pathways. (TABLE 1) When the addition
of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibiting
VEGF, to chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer
(CRC) offered an almost 5 month survival benefit,
considerable effort was directed to develop other
angiogenesis blockers[14]. Subsequent studies have
attempted to match this benefit in other tumor types.
Advanced gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies are
a wide spectrum of diseases with variable prognoses
depending on the stage at diagnosis. On one end of this
spectrum is advanced gastric and pancreatic cancers
which have uniformly poor overall survival from
diagnosis regardless of treatment; on the other end of
this spectrum is metastatic CRC which, when treated
with a sequence of well established therapies, affords
a median survival in excess of two years. The use of
biologic agents, particularly antiangiogenics, has been at
the forefront of clinical investigations in GI malignancies
for most of the last decade. Mechanistically, the theories
behind inhibiting new blood vessel formation, including
improved delivery of concurrently administered cytotoxic
drugs and promotion of effective delivery of blood and
nutrients intra-tumorally, are valid. Unfortunately, for

Up-regulation of angiogenesis is required
for development of malignancy, tumor growth and
progression [1,2]. The vascular endothelial growth factor
family of ligands (VEGF-A (VEGF), VEGF-B, VEGF-C,
VEGF-D, VEGF-E, and placental growth factor(PlGF))
and receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, FLT-3,
platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and
C-KIT) are the most studied angiogenic pathways [3,4].
(FIGURE 1) Extracellular interaction of the ligands
with VEGFRs encourages receptor dimerization, leads to
receptor autophosphorylation, and subsequently activates
downstream angiogenic and growth pathways. VEGF
binds primarily to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 whose
expression is more pronounced in tumor vasculature
endothelial cells [5]. VEGF/VEGFR binding results in
cellular proliferation, vascular differentiation, altered
vascular permeability, and migration [6-13].
Inhibiting cellular angiogenic machinery is a
well researched area of cancer care. Over the last
decade, several antiangiogenic compounds have been
developed, investigated, and approved for cancer
treatment. Inhibiting angiogenesis can occur via various
mechanisms. To date, drug development has focused on

uncertain reasons, many antiangiogenic agents have not
been effective in GI cancers. Herein, we review the
use of antiangiogenic compounds which have proven
clinical benefit in GI malignancies, discuss some novel
agents currently under investigation, and make critical
conclusions as to the effectiveness of this avenue as anticancer treatment in GI tumors

are achieved with three drug combinations compared to
doublet therapy [19].
VEGF and angiogenesis appear to have an important
role in pathogenesis and prognosis of EGC. VEGF
expression increases with increasing stage and disease
burden in EGC [20,21]. Furthermore, VEGF expression
is a negative prognostic factor for survival in this patient
group [22,23]. In a gastric xenograft model, inhibition
of VEGF activity by an immuno-neutralizing antibody
was effective suggesting that VEGF inhibition may have
therapeutic value [24]. Phase II studies of bevacizumab
combined with chemotherapy (irinotecan and cisplatin;
oxaliplatin and docetaxel or 5-fluoruracil (FU); docetaxel,
cisplatin, and FU) showed promising results in previously
treated and untreated patients (RR 63-71%) [25-28]. The
phase III study, AVAGAST, which combined bevacizumab
or placebo with capecitabine and cisplatin showed a
significant improvement in overall response rate (ORR
38% vs 29.5%) and progression free survival (PFS 6.7 vs
5.3 months) [29]. However, the study failed to improve
overall survival (OS), its primary endpoint.
Ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody directed
at VEGFR-2, is currently being tested in a randomized
phase III study as a second-line agent in metastatic EGC
(NCT009117384).
Several small molecule TKIs to VEGFRs have also
undergone early phase II testing in EGC. Sorafenib in

ESOPHAGOGASTRIC CANCERS (EGC)
Gastric and esophageal cancers are the second and
sixth leading causes of cancer related death worldwide,
respectively [15].
Esophageal adenocarcinoma is
now more prevalent than squamous cell carcinoma in
North America and Western Europe and, as it is often
difficult to determine if the cancer originates in the
gastroesophageal junction or distal esophagus, patients
with advanced diseases are often treated akin to advanced
gastric adenocarcinoma. There is little data on the role
of angiogenesis inhibitors in patients with esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma. As such, this discussion will be
limited to EGC adenocarcinoma.
Patients with metastatic EGC have 5 year survival
rates of 10-15%. When compared to best supportive
care, palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy improves survival
[16-18]. Although there is no single internationally
accepted standard of care regimen, the best survival rates

combination with docetaxel and cisplatin in treatmentnaive patients with metastatic EGC demonstrated partial
responses (PR) of 41%, median PFS of 5.8 months, and
median OS of 13.6 months [30]. Sunitinib as a secondline single agent treatment for advanced gastric cancer
demonstrated a disease control rate of 35% [31].

toxicity in the sunitinib arm; it did not meet the pre-defined
criteria for superiority or non-inferiority (NCT00699374).
Two phase II studies examining the activity of singleagent bevacizumab in advanced HCC both demonstrate
promising antitumour activity (RR 12.5-13%; PFS
6.9 months) but toxicity, in particular gastrointestinal
bleeding, is concerning, [46,47]. There have been three
single arm phase II studies of bevacizumab in combination
with a variety of chemotherapy regimens which show
evidence of clinical activity but randomized comparisons
are required [48-50].

CANCERS OF THE HEPATOBILIARY
TRACT
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

Biliary tract cancers (BTC)

HCC is the third leading cause of death worldwide
after lung and gastric cancer [32]. Less than 30% of
patients are eligible for surgery due to advanced stage
of disease at presentation and treatment with cytotoxic
chemotherapy has been disappointing with multiple
studies failing to show an improvement in OS [33].
HCC’s are highly vascular tumors. High microvessel
density and levels of circulating VEGF are associated with
poorer outcomes, thus making the angiogenesis pathway
an attractive therapeutic target [34-39].
Sorafenib is the first systemic agent demonstrating an
improvement in OS in patients with advanced HCC. The
initial phase II study of 137 patients showed promising
activity with a median OS of 9.2 months and a median
time to progression (TTP) of 5.5 months [40]. Patients
with Child-Pugh Class B liver function had similar
incidence of drug-related adverse events but had more
frequent worsening of liver disease (encephalopathy 11%
vs. 2%; worsening ascites 18% vs. 11%) than patients
with Child-Pugh A liver function as well as significantly
worse OS (14 weeks vs. 41 weeks) [41]. Two phase
III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled studies
confirmed the activity of this agent. Both studies limited
enrollment to patients with Childs-Pugh A liver function.
The SHARP study enrolled patients from Europe, North
and South America and Australasia and had hepatitis C
and alcohol as the predominant risk factors for HCC. The
Asia-Pacific trial enrolled patients from China, South
Korea and Taiwan and had hepatitis B as the predominant
HCC risk factor. Both studies demonstrated a significant
OS improvement (SHARP: 10.7 vs. 7.9 months, HR
0.69, p<0.001; Asia-Pacific: 6.5 vs. 4.2 months, HR 0.68,
p=0.014) and disease control rate (SHARP: 43% vs. 32%,
p=0.0002; Asia-Pacific: 35.5% vs. 15.8%, p=0.0019) with
sorafenib as compared to best supportive care. Response
rates (RR) were low (2% and 3.3% respectively) and
there was no difference between the arms in time to
symptomatic progression [42,43].
In early phase II studies, sunitinib also demonstrated
activity in the treatment of advanced HCC [44,45].
However, a phase III study comparing sunitinib to
sorafenib was terminated in April 2010 due to increased
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

BTC, which include intra- and extra-hepatic
cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder malignancies, are rare
tumours accounting for only 3-4% of GI cancers. Surgery
is the only curative option but most patients present with
unresectable disease [51]. In patients with advanced BTC,
only recently has treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin
demonstrated an improvement in OS [52].
In contrast to HCC, BTC metastases tend to be
hypovascular. However, VEGF expression in these
tumors does correlate with advanced disease stage and
poor prognosis [53,54]. A phase II clinical trial using
gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) combined with
bevacizumab demonstrated modest activity with an ORR
of 40%, median PFS 7.0 months and median OS of 12.7
months [55]. However, the 6-month PFS did not meet
the pre-specified endpoint of an improvement from 50%
to 70% as compare to GEMOX alone. Randomized
comparisons are needed to evaluate the added benefit of
bevacizumab. To date, attempts at TKI inhibition have
not been beneficial in BTC. Two phase II clinical trials
of sorafenib failed to show significant clinical activity
[56,57].

PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA
Pancreas cancer is the fourth commonest cause of
cancer-related mortality across the world, with incidence
equaling mortality [58]. Only 15-20% of patients present
with surgically resectable disease and, of these, only
20% will survive 5 years. The OS for patients with
metastatic or locally advanced disease is 4-9 months.
Gemcitabine remains the standard chemotherapy for this
disease with a modest benefit in OS [59]. Multiple studies
combining gemcitabine with other cytotoxic agents have
not demonstrated improvement in survival [60-62]. The
phase III randomized trial of gemcitabine vs gemcitabine
+ erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitor did improve median OS from 5.91 months to
6.24 months but the clinical relevance of this benefit is
questioned by the medical oncology community [63].
VEGF and its receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2)
518

Oncotarget 2010; 1: 515 - 529

are co-expressed in pancreatic cancer suggesting that
VEGF could have autocrine effects on pancreatic cancer
cells that express VEGF receptors and paracrine effects
on microvascular endothelial cells [64-66]. In animal
models, VEGF TKIs and anti-VEGF and anti-VEGFR-2
antibodies inhibit growth and angiogenesis associated
with pancreatic tumors and potentiated the tumoricidal
effect of gemcitabine [67-71].
Activity in the phase II trials combining gemcitabine
and bevacizumab looked promising and, based upon
these results, bevacizumab was tested in two randomized
controlled phase III studies [72,73]. In these trials,
gemcitabine with or without bevacizumab and gemcitabine
plus erlotinib with or without bevacizumab both failed to
show a survival benefit with the addition of bevacizumab
[74,75]. Other VEGF targeted therapies tested in the
setting of pancreatic cancer include sorafenib, axitinib,
and sunitinib but limited activity in phase II trials ended
further investigations into these agents [76-78].

COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMAS
Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common
cancer in men and women [79]. Patients with untreated
metastatic CRC (mCRC) have a median survival of 5 – 6
months [80]. Prior to the emergence of the topoisomerase
I inhibitor irinotecan in 1996, treatment for metastatic
colorectal cancer was limited to FU and leucovorin
(LV). This was followed in 2004, by the introduction
of oxaliplatin. An analysis of several large, phase III
studies demonstrates that exposure at some time during
treatment to these three agents (FU plus LV, irinotecan,
and oxaliplatin) significantly improves overall survival
OS of mCRC to an average of 20 months [81].

VEGF expression and proliferative activity in tumors
[82]. Furthermore, in vivo murine antihuman monoclonal
antibodies targeted against VEGF inhibited growth of
human tumor xenografts [83]. Based on these findings,
two randomized phase II studies combining FU +LV
with bevacizumab demonstrated improved clinical
efficacy over FU + LV alone [84,85]. (Table 2) The
landmark phase III trial by Hurwitz et al which led to
the clinical approval of bevacizumab for the treatment
of mCRC compared either FU + LV + irinotecan (IFL) +
bevacizumab to IFL + placebo which reported a median
OS of 20.3 months versus 15.6 months [14]. (Table 2)
However, the IFL regimen has fallen out of favor due
to the improved tolerance and efficacy of infusional FU
+ irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as compared to modified IFL
(mIFL) [86]. This trial was then modified in April 2004 to
assess the addition of bevacizumab to both of these arms
of the trial with both the PFS and median OS favoring the
patients receiving FOLFIRI + bevacizumab as compared
to mIFL + bevacizumab. Although this trial did not
directly compare FOLFIRI administered with or without
bevacizumab, it does suggest FOLFIRI + bevacizumab is
more efficacious than mIFL + bevacizumab.
The combination of bevacizumab with oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy as first line therapy has also been
investigated in a randomized, double-blind study
designated N016966 [87]. In this study, 1,400 patients
received FU + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or capecitabine
+ oxaliplatin (XELOX), with either bevacizumab or
placebo. Although an improvement in median PFS was
seen, neither an improvement in RR or median OS was
achieved. (Table 2) It is hypothesized that the failure to
improve median OS was due to early discontinuation of
the capecitabine or FU and bevacizumab when oxaliplatin
peripheral neurotoxicity occurred hence diminishing the
impact of bevacizumab [88]. In the second-line setting,

antiangiogenic compounds. Nonetheless, multiple other
novel agents are currently under investigation. Below is
a summary of the most promising agents that may prove
beneficial in patients with GI malignancies.

hypertension, fatigue, hand-foot blistering, and myalgias
[99]. Three patients achieved partial response with
48% of patients recording stable disease. Effective
antiangiogenesis was noted on dynamic contrast enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) which may act
as a biomarker after further evaluation. The majority of
clinical development of this agent is ongoing in CRC
and HCC. Interim results from a phase II study in ChildPugh A and B HCC reported tolerable toxicities and 42%
of evaluable patients were progression free at 16 weeks
[102]. Other ongoing GI trials using ABT-869 are listed
in table 3.

Small molecule TKIs
Brivanib alaninate
Brivanib alaninate is an oral small molecule
TKI active against VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3,
and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR).
The FGF pathway has a demonstrated role in cancer
progression and FGF level are elevated akin to VEGF
levels in malignancy [94,95]. Dual blockade of VEGFRs
and FGFR is attractive clinically as FGF signaling has
been implicated in resistance to VEGFR inhibition [96].
There is particular interest in the development of this drug
in some GI malignancies due to particularly high levels
of FGF in HCC and the known FGF overexpression in
gastric cancer [97,98]. Multiple phase I studies have
demonstrated safety of brivanib both alone and in
combination with cytotoxics. Ongoing trials in GI cancers
are listed in table 3.

ZD6474
ZD6474 is a TKI potently inhibiting VEGFR-2,
Rearranged during Transfection (RET), Flt-4, and EGFR
[103,104]. Initial dose finding studies in patients with
advanced solid malignancies who had failed standard of
care treatments report good tolerability at doses <300mg
[105,106]. As preclinical data supported use in a wide
spectrum of human malignancies, clinical development of
AZ6474 has been across multiple tumor types. In colon
cancers, ZD6474 has been combined with FOLFIRI and
FOLFOX with good tolerability [107,108]. A phase II
study of FOLFIRI plus ZD6474 did not confirm benefit
with the combination [109]. A combination of gemcitabine
+ capecitabine + ZD6474 in biliary and pancreatic cancer
has shown promising early clinical results [110]. There
is additional preclinical data supporting ZD6474 use in
gastric cancers [111,112]. Ongoing clinical trials in GI
cancers are listed in table 3.

ABT-869

ABT-869 is an oral potent TKI inhibitor of
VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFRß, and Flt3
[99,100]. Data suggests ABT-869 is more selective
Inhibiting VEGFRs
toward VEGFR and PDGFR than other similar TKIs while
also having apoptotic effects [101]. Efficacy was seen
with this drug in colorectal xenografts models [101]. A

domains of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, it has low pM
affinity for VEGF, VEGF-B and PlGF [122,123]. When
administered intravenously every 2 weeks, aflibercept
was well tolerated with rectal ulceration and proteinuria
being the dose limiting toxicities. Other toxicities were
in keeping with inhibition of the VEGF/VEGFR pathway.
Three patients experienced a partial response. A phase
II study in metastatic CRC has also demonstrated benefit
in a bevacizumab pre-treated cohort prompting further
investigations in this area [124]. Ongoing studies with
aflibercept in GI malignancies are listed in table 5.

Ramucirumab is a fully human mAb with low pM
affinity to the VEGF-binding domain of VEGFR-2 [113].
Dose-finding studies were undertaken with weekly and
every 2 and 3 week single agent administration with very
good drug tolerance [114,115]. Common toxicities were
as expected based on the antibodies’ mechanism of action
and included thrombotic events, hypertension, proteinuria,
and bleeding. Initial reports suggest a greater clinical
benefit with the use of ramucirumab than other clinically
tested antiangiogenic agents, though randomized clinical
trials must be undertaken to prove superiority [114,116].
More advanced studies using a dose of 8 mg/kg every 2
weeks are ongoing and listed in table 4. Early data from
the phase II study of ramucirumab used in the first-line
setting in Childs-Pugh A and B HCC is promising in
sorafenib-naïve patients with a 50% disease control rate
[117].

SUMMARY
Antiangiogenic agents have clearly advanced the
treatment of GI malignancies, most notably CRC and
HCC. Unfortunately, there have been no advances in
the treatment of incurable EGC and pancreas cancer
using antiangiogenic agents and prognosis remains poor.
Despite the promising results in CRC with bevacizumab
and HCC with sorafenib, multiple clinical trials using
other methods of blocking the VEGF pathway have
been negative in these and the other GI malignancies.
The mechanisms of resistance to VEGF inhibition is not
known. Despite preclinical models suggesting that VEGF
inhibition should be effective in all GI malignancies; this
has not been confirmed in clinical practice.
Uncertainty exists in many of these negative trials
as to why the study or drug failed. Likely, the answer
is multifactorial being related to a combination of drug
ineffectiveness once used in a randomized phase III setting,
poor clinical trial design, suboptimal patient selection,
and lack of a reliable biomarker to direct clinicians on
which patients will or will not benefit. The importance
of predictors for treatment response of these agents are
exemplified well by the results of the AVAGAST study

IMC-18F1
IMC-18F1 has had a slower clinical development
compared to ramucirumab. An intravenous recombinant
human IgG1 anti-VEGFR-1 mAb, IMC-18F1 inhibits
ligand-induced VEGFR-1 activation at low pM
concentrations [118]. Final data from a multi-schedule
phase I single agent dose finding study is pending but
preliminary information revealed safely and biologic
activity supporting further development of the drug [119].
Clinical development of IMC-18F1 is listed in table 4.

Decoy fusion proteins
Aflibercept, a novel fully human recombinant
decoy fusion protein, has recently completed phase I
clinical testing [120,121]. Mimicking immunoglobin

suggesting that there is a patient population which may
benefit from the addition of an angiogenesis inhibitor, but
when studied in a general patient population, a survival
benefit could not be attained. Biomarkers are needed to
delineate those patients who will benefit and those who
will not.
In CRC, investigations are underway to determine
genetic profiles or other patient characteristics to help
identify those who will benefit from anti-angiogenic
inhibition. Until trials can clarify the optimal use of
these agents, data supports exposure, at some point in the
treatment of mCRC, to bevacizumab in fit patients. In all
GI tumors, the use of newer genetically engineered cancer
models may help elucidate mechanisms of resistance
or biomarkers to aid clinician treatment choices [125].
Additionally, though not necessarily practical, the use of
newer imaging techniques, like DCE-MRI, may play a
role in early determination of antiangiogenic efficacy.
Until the time when biomarkers are identified and
validated to predict effectiveness of these agents, we
may be wasting precious resources in trying to develop
antiangiogenic agents further. New agents look attractive
but intelligent clinical trial development will be required
to find these new drugs a niche in an already saturated area
of cancer treatment.
