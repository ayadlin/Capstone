ABSTRACT
T-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is highly and frequently expressed in
various cancer tissues and plays an indispensable role in the mitosis of cancer cells,
and therefore, it is an important target for drug treatment of tumor. Ilaprazole was
identified to be a potent TOPK inhibitor. The data indicated that ilaprazole inhibited
TOPK activities with high affinity and selectivity. In vitro studies showed that
ilaprazole inhibited TOPK activities in HCT116, ES-2, A549, SW1990 cancer cells.
Moreover, knockdown of TOPK in these cells decreased their sensitivities to ilaprazole.
Results of an in vivo study demonstrated that gavage of ilaprazole in HCT116 colon
tumor-bearing mice effectively suppressed cancer growth. The TOPK downstream
signaling molecule phospho-histone H3 in tumor tissues was also decreased after
ilaprazole treatment. Our results suggested that ilaprazole inhibited the cancer growth
by targeting TOPK both in vitro and in vivo.

promoting effects [9]. Based on these findings, TOPK has
become a novel target for cancer treatment attracting more
and more attentions [10]. Some TOPK inhibitors, such as
HI-TOPK-032 [11] and OTS964 [12] have been reported
in 2012 and 2014, respectively. However, none of them
had been in clinical trials because of their toxicities or poor
pharmacokinetic properties.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), like omeprazole
and esomeprazole, are standard treatments for gastric
acid-related diseases, acting as potent inhibitors of the
gastric acid pump [13]. A few studies showed that PPIs
could enhance antitumor effects of cytotoxic drugs in
drug-resistant tumors by inhibiting V-ATPase activities
or affecting homeostasis, especially acidic vesicles
trafficking in cancer cells [14–16]. In our previous study,
pantoprazole (PPZ), a PPI was identified as a TOPK

INTRODUCTION
TOPK (T-lymphokine-activated killer cell-originated
protein kinase) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase, also known as
PBK or PDZ-binding kinase, which belongs to the MEK
protein family [1, 2]. The PBK/TOPK protein is up-regulated
in certain types of cancer cells such as breast, colon, lung
and glioma cancer cells [3–5], but is difficult to be detected
in normal tissues except several fetal tissues and germ cells
of the testis [6]. In molecular studies, over-expression of
TOPK involves in mitotic checkpoint of tumor cells, cell
apoptosis and inflammation [7]. In addition, TOPK was also
reported to increase cell migration by modulating a PI3K/
PTEN/AKT-dependent signaling pathway [8]. Furthermore,
histone H3 could be phosphorylated at Ser10 by TOPK
both in vivo and in vitro, which could mediate cell growthwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitor which could suppress growth of colorectal cancer
cells [17]. This is the first report that PPIs can directly
inhibit cancer growth via a proton pump independent
mechanism.
Inspired by our results of pantoprazole, we
speculated that other PPIs may also be developed as
TOPK inhibitors. Based on the availability, another
six proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in clinical use were
screened against TOPK by virtual ligand screening
method, microscale thermophoresis (MST) and cytotoxic
activity assay. Ilaprazole, a novel proton pump inhibitor,
was found to show potent antitumor activities through the
inhibition of TOPK-specific kinase function.

stacking interactions may form between the pyridine ring
of ilaprazole with the pyrrole ring of Pro169, the pyrrole
ring of ilaprazole with the pyrrole ring of Pro154 (Figure
1b, 1c).
To validate results of the virtual ligand screening,
we employed microscale therm ophoresis method (MST)
to assay the binding affinity between compounds and
TOPK. This technology detected fluorescent changes of
molecules during thermophoresis, to quantify proteinprotein interactions or protein-small molecule interactions
with high sensitivity and low sample cost. Among PPIs
assayed, except pantoprazole, ilaprazole exhibited the
lowest equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 111.0 ±
2.3 μM (Table 1, Figure 1d), which meant the strongest
binding.
Attempts were then made to determine whether PPIs
could affect growth of colon cancer cells. As shown in
Table 1, seven PPIs exhibited certain levels of inhibition
for TOPK over-expressed HCT116 cells with IC50 values
from 43.0 to 348.3 μM. The activity ranking was ilaprazole
> lansoprazole > pantoprazole for the best three prazoles.
Ilaprazole, the one with strongest inhibitory effects, was
chosen for further investigations.

RESULTS
Identification of ilaprazole as TOPK inhibitors
In our previous study, we identified proton pump
inhibitor pantoprazole as a potent TOPK inhibitor [13].
It suppressed cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo.
Encouraged by this finding, we then sought to determine
if any drugs from the same class could also potentially
inhibit TOPK activities. The homology model of human
TOPK was constructed by using the X-ray structure of
the mixed-lineage kinase MLK1 (PDB code: 3DTC) as
the template, which has 29% of sequence identities to the
human TOPK. The docking was performed by using ICM
3.8.1 modeling software (MolSoft LLC, San Diego, CA).
As is shown in the Figure 1a, all of the PPIs compounds
are structural analogues, weakly basic 2-pyridylmethylsulfinyl-benzimidazoles derivatives. The virtual screening
results of seven prazoles were shown in Table 1. The top
three compounds with highest ICM scores were ilaprazole,
lansoprazole and omeprazole. From the generated docking
model of ilaprazole, hydrogen bonds were predicted
between the methoxyl oxygen of ilaprazole with Gly223,
pyridine nitrogen with Arg155, respectively. Also, π-π

TOPK expression in cancer cell lines
TOPK protein levels were measured by western
blot in cancer cell lines derived from various cancer types,
such as lung cancer (A549), colon cancer (HCT116),
human ovarian cancer (ES-2) and pancreatic cancer
cell (SW1990). High expression levels of TOPK were
observed in all these cell lines (Figure 2a, 2b). The growth
inhibitory effects of ilaprazole on each cell line were
measured, and obtained IC50 values were ranging from
30.10 to 148.21 μM (Figure 2c). Ilaprazole exhibited
potent inhibitory activities against the growth of HCT116
cells (IC50 = 40.0 ± 0.6 μM) and ES-2 cells (IC50 = 33.2 ±
1.0 μM) (Figure 2d, 2e).

cells by western blot analysis. Results showed that the
phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser10) was substantially
attenuated in a dose-dependent manner after treatment
with ilaprazole (Figure 2f–2i). These results suggested that
TOPK was a direct target for ilaprazole to suppress cancer
cell growth. Immunocytochemical staining results showed
that TOPK-mediated p-Histone H3 was substantially
decreased dose-dependently with ilaprazole treatment.
(Figure 3a, 3b, Supplementary Figure 1a, 1b)

TOPK proteins were expressed mainly around
chromosomal surfaces in mitotic cells, particularly at
prophase and metaphase, so the histone was chosen as
the substrate for TOPK activity evaluation. Some reports
confirmed that TOPK could phosphorylate histone H3 in
vitro and in vivo. Hence, we examined whether ilaprazole
could suppress TOPK activities in HCT116 and ES-2

Effects of ilaprazole on the cellular apoptosis of
HCT116 and ES-2 cells were further investigated. Cells
were pre-treated with different concentrations of ilaprzole
for 24 h, and then the cellular apoptosis was measured by
using flow cytometry. Normalization to the DMSO-treated

controls revealed that ilaprazole at 50 μM induced 32.03%
(HCT116) and 7.62% (ES-2) apoptotic death compared
with 2% of the control (Figure 3c, 3d).
In order to determine effects of cell apoptosis

μM ilaprazole were stained with Hoechst 33342 and the
typical morphological features of later stage apoptosis
increased condensation of chromatin material and
fragmentation of the nuclei were observed (Figure 3e).
Ilaprazole was also found to induce the cleavage
of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a DNA repair
regulatory protein. Furthermore, the active cleavage forms
of caspase-3 were observed after treating with ilaprazole
for 24 hours, indicating that it might induce apoptotic
cell death by activation of caspases in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 3f). These results suggested that ilaprazole
might induce apoptosis in HCT116 and ES-2 cells. In
addition, the cell cycle distributions of HCT116 cells were
examined after treating with increasing doses of ilaprazole
for 48 hours. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that
ilaprazole induced cell cycle arrested at the G1 phase in
HCT116 cells, as shown in Supplementary Figure 2.

stably expressing low levels of TOPK (shTOPK) were
established. As the control, cells were infected with
shMock. The abundance of TOPK in these cells was
confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure 2a).
Effects of ilaprazole on the growth of shMock
and shTOPK infected colon cancer cells were assessed
by CCK8 assay. Results indicated that cells infected
with shTOPK were resistant to the inhibitory effect of
ilaprazole on the growth compared with cells infected
with shMock (Figure 4). These findings suggested that
anticancer activities induced by ilaprazole were dependent
on the TOPK expression.

Ilaprazole suppresses tumor growth by
inhibiting TOPK activity in vivo
After injected with HCT 116 cells, CB-17/Icr-scid
mice were divided into three matched groups including
a vehicle control and two ilaprazole treating groups (75,
150 mg/kg). After establishing palpable tumors, mice
were administrated with ilaprazole or vehicle via gavage
daily. Estimated tumor volumes of both treating groups
were less than that of the control group throughout the
treatment. Significant decreases of the tumor volume
were observed after 2 weeks’ treatment (Figure 5a, Figure

weights were measured and calculated. The tumor weight
of the control group was 1.45 ± 0.33 g, whereas the
tumor weights of low-dose and high-dose treated groups
were 0.67 ± 0.21g and 0.52 ± 0.11g, respectively (Figure

5c), representing significant reduction. Moreover, no
obvious hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, or differences
of average body weights among the three groups were
observed throughout the study (Figure 5b, Supplementary
Figure 3), which revealed that the dosage of ilaprazole

in vivo, while its binding affinity with TOPK was weaker
than pantoprazole.
Use of ilaprazole has been shown to inhibit the
growth of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our
results indicated that TOPK highly expressed cancer cells
were strongly inhibited by ilaprazole and the anticancer
activity induced by ilaprazole was dependent on the TOPK
expression. The phosphorylations of histone H3 (Ser10),
the downstream substrate of TOPK, were strongly reduced
in cancer cells by treating with ilaprazole. Notably, the
phosphorylations of histone H3 (Ser10) were significantly
inhibited in ilaprazole-treated tumor tissues.
As we know, long-term and high-dose PPIs
treatment has been shown to be well tolerated in patients
with few side effects. [18–20] Therefore, repositioning
PPIs as anticancer drugs will be unlikely to have added
toxicities. Although PPIs has been proposed as the
adjuvant drugs for cancer treatment, and even a clinical
trial was performed to evaluate the use of pantoprazole
in combination with doxorubicin for advanced cancer
patients with solid tumors [21, 22]. However, whether
PPIs directly suppress tumor growth remained to be
determined.
Ilaprazole is a new PPI that was developed by
Livon Pharmaceutical Group, approved in China for the
treatment of duodenal ulcer in 2007. The toxicological data
showed that the LD50 of ilaprazole was more than 5000
mg/kg in rats [23]. In this study, we have demonstrated
that oral administration of ilaprazole 75 mg/kg and 150
mg/kg had no obvious hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity,
or difference of average body weights. Considering the
low toxicities of ilaprazole and effective anti-tumor
activities observed in this study, it would be suitable to
expand its applications to targeted cancer therapy.
In conclusion, we discovered ilaprazole as a novel
and specific TOPK inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo.
These findings should be useful for further development of
drugs targeting TOPK by employing ilaprazole as the lead
compound. Future studies will focus on the efficacy of
ilaprazole and characterize its therapeutic potential against
other cancers with high expression levels of TOPK.

used in this experiment had no obvious side effects on
animals’ growth. To further determine whether antitumor
effects of ilaprazole were associated with its inhibition of
TOPK activities, tumor extracted from each group were
prepared and analyzed for the phosphorylation of histone
H3 by immunohistochemistry analysis. Results showed
that expression levels of phosphorylated histone H3
were substantially decreased in ilaprazole-treated groups
compared with the vehicle group (Figure 5e). Overall,
the results indicated that ilaprazole could suppress tumor
growth by inhibiting TOPK activities in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Previous studies have shown that TOPK, a novel
serine-threonine kinase, belongs to the MAPKK family.
Many groups have reported that TOPK was associated
with oncogenic cellular functions including tumor
development, cancer growth, and anti-apoptotic effects
[1–2, 7–9]. These findings suggest that TOPK is a novel
target for development of anticancer agents.
Based on our previous finding that pantoprazole was
the inhibitor of TOPK, we screened another 6 prazoles
for potential TOPK inhibitory activities, and identified
ilaprazole as another potent TOPK inhibitor. According
to our results, PPIs’ inhibitory effects on TOPK were
affected by the presence of steric hindrance near pyridine
group and substituents on the benzimidazole. Apparently,
disuprazole and rabeprazole exhibited lower ICM scores,
presumably because of the larger substituents ethylthio
group and methoxypropoxy group respectively, which
revealed that the substituent at 4-position of pyridine ring
influenced the inhibitory potential as a result of steric
hindrance. Results of MST assay and activities on HCT116
cells also supported this hypothesis that steric hindrance
of substituents of pyridine ring was one of the crucial
factors affecting inhibitory activities. Another important
factor affecting inhibitory activities was the substituent at
5-position of the benzimidazole. As an electron-donating
group, methoxyl group at 5-position may promote the
ability to inhibit TOPK. Consequently, pantoprazole and
omeprazole showed a stronger affinity with TOPK. By
forming π-π stacking interaction with the pyrrole ring
of Pro154, pyrrole ring at 5-position also promoted the
ability to inhibit TOPK, consequently making ilaprazole a
promising inhibitor against TOPK with lower IC50 value.
When physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties
are taken into consideration, it is not difficult to illuminate
that ilaprazole exhibited the strongest inhibitory effects in
vitro and in vivo. The logP value of ilaprazole is larger
than that of pantoprazole according to the data from
SciFinder Academic database (logP value of ilaprazole:
2.882 ± 1.045; logP value of pantoprazole: 1.571 ± 1.065).
This may offer parts of the explanation for the reason why
ilaprazole showed stronger inhibitory effects in vitro and

Cell culture

Homology modeling and molecular docking

Human cancer cells lines, HCT116 (ATCC # CCL247™), ES-2 (ATCC # CRL-1978™), A549 (ATCC #
CRM-CCL-185™) and SW1990 (ATCC # CRL-2172™),
were cultured under the recommendations of their
respective depositors. All cell lines were authenticated
by STR analysis from Shanghai Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou
Biotechnology Co.,Ltd.
The cells were grown for 2-3 days, after reaching
90% of confluence, were then harvested by exposure to
0.25% Trypsin-EDTA solution and then passed into new
T-25 tissue culture flasks. The cell cultures were performed
following the instructions of ATCC.

With the crystal structure of the mixed-lineage
kinase MLK1 (PDB code: 3DTC) as the template, a
homology model of human TOPK (accession number:
NP_060962) was constructed by using MODELLER
(an automated homology modeling program) [25, 26].
Chemical structures of prazoles were input as mol2
files for docking [21]. The docking was performed by
using ICM 3.8.1 modeling software on an Intel i7 4960
processor (MolSoft LLC, San Diego, CA) [27]. Ligand
binding pocket residues were selected by using graphical
tools in the ICM software, to create the boundaries of
the docking search. In the docking calculation, potential
energy maps of the receptor were calculated using default
parameters. The compounds were imported into ICM and
an index file was created. The conformational sampling
was based on the Monte Carlo procedure, and finally the
lowest-energy and the most favorable orientation of the
ligand was selected.

Protein expression, purification
Human TOPK gene (Accssion number:
NM_018492) was cloned into the pET26b vector
(Novagen). The expression construct pET26b-TOPK
was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21
(DE) (Invitrogen) and selected on kanamycin plates.
The transformed cells were cultivated in Luria-Bertani
(LB) media at 37°C in the presence of kanamycin
until the optical density (OD) reached 0.8. Cells were
then induced with 0.4 mM IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-1thiogalactopyranoside) for 16 h at 20°C. The cells
harvested by centrifugation were lysed by ultrasonication
on ice in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 200 mM
NaCl, 5 mM mercaptoethanol, 0.1% TritonX-100, and 5%
glycerol.
Soluble hexa-histidine tagged TOPK was bound to
Ni-agarose affinity resin (Qiagen), washed with buffer
A (20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 200mM NaCl, and 10 mM
imidazole), and eluted with buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 8.8,
250 mM NaCl, and 150 mM imidazole).

Cell viability assay
To estimate cell viability, human colon cancer HCT
116, ES-2, A549 and SW1990 cells (5000 cells/well) were
seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2
incubator. The attached cells were fed with fresh medium
containing various concentrations of ilaprazole (0-100
μM) for additional 24 h and 48 h. After culturing for
various times, the cytotoxicity of ilaprazole was measured
using a cck8 assay kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All experiments were performed in triplicate,
and the mean absorbance values were calculated. The
results are expressed as the percentage of inhibition
that produced a reduction in absorbance by ilaprazole
treatment compared with the non-treated cells (control).

mM EGTA, 10 mg/mL aprotinin, 10 mg/mL leupeptin,
5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyluoride (PMSF), 1 mM
dithiolthreitol (DTT) containing 1% Triton X-100).
Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 12000
rpm for 15 minutes, and protein’s content was determined
using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, USA). Lysate
protein (20-40 μg) was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE
and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (PVDF) (Millipore, USA). The
membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk or 5%
BSA for 1 hour and then incubated with the specific
primary antibodies respectively at 4°C overnight.
Protein bands were visualized using an enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent (ECL Plus) (GE Healthcare,
USA) after hybridization with a HRP conjugated
secondary antibody. Band density was quantified using
the Image J software program (NIH).

In vivo xenograft mouse model
CB-17/Icr-scid mice were purchased from
Beijing HFK Bioscience CO., LTD (Beijing, China).
The animals were maintained under ‘specific pathogen
free’ conditions. The mice were randomly divided into
three groups: (i) vehicle group (n = 8); (ii) 150 mg/
kg ilaprazole-treated group (n = 8); (III) 75 mg/kg
ilaprazole-treated group. HCT 116 cells were inoculated
subcutaneously (2 × 106 cells) into the left flank of
each mouse in all groups. Treatment was started after 4
days of cell injection. The duration of the animal study
was 19 days. The tumor volume was calculated from
measurements of 3 diameters of the individual tumor
based on the following formula:
tumor volume (mm3) = (length × width × height ×
0.52). The mice were monitored until tumors reached 1
cm3 total volume, at which the mice were euthanized and
the tumors were extracted. The tumors were dissected and
sent for immune-histochemical analysis.

Apoptosis analysis
Apoptotic cells were assessed by staining PBS
washed cells with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated
annexin-V (BD Pharmingen) for 10-15 minutes in
incubation buffer (Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining Kit,
Roche). Fluorescence was recorded by flow cytometry
using the FACS Aria (BD Bio sciences).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of the data was performed using
Graph Pad Prism 5.0 software. The data were expressed as
the means ± SD. Values were analyzed using SPSS version
12.0 software by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),
and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Hoechst 33342 staining
After incubation with ilaprazole for 24 h, the cells
were stained with Hoechst 33342 at 37°C for 30 min,
and then the morphology was observed by fluorescence
microscopy (Zeiss, OBSERVER D1/AX10 cam HRC).
