ABSTRACT
Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a transmembrane protein that is
expressed on tumor cells that suppresses the T cell-mediated immune response.
Therapies targeting the PD-L1 pathway promote anti-tumor immunity and have
shown promising results in some types of cancers. However, the functional and
therapeutic roles of PD-L1 in osteosarcoma remain largely unknown. In this study,
we found that PD-L1 protein was expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissue
microarray of patient tumors. Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry analysis
showed that the overall and five-year survival rates of patients with high levels
of PD-L1 expression were significantly shorter than patients with low levels. High
levels of PD-L1 expression were also associated with metastasis in osteosarcoma
patients. Furthermore, we applied the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to target PD-L1 gene at the DNA level
in osteosarcoma cell lines. We found that the expression of PD-L1 could be efficiently
disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 system and PD-L1 knockdown increased drug sensitivities
for doxorubicin and paclitaxel. These results suggest that PD-L1 is an independent
prognostic factor in osteosarcoma and that PD-L1 knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 may be
a therapeutic approach for the treatment of osteosarcoma.

INTRODUCTION

developing metastasis is less than one year [2]. Therefore,
more effective therapeutic strategies are required for the
treatment of osteosarcoma.
Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is the
ligand for programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). As an immune
inhibitory moiety, PD-L1 is expressed by most cell types
including cancer cells. PD-L1 is able to deliver an inhibitory
signal to PD-1 expressing T cells, resulting in immune
system impairment [3]. Recent evidence strongly suggests
that the activation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway represents
a mechanism allowing tumors to escape the host’s immune
system [4, 5]. Therapies targeting this signaling pathway

Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary
malignant bone tumor affecting both children and adults.
Current treatment for osteosarcoma is effective but
limited. While surgery alone can only result in long-term
survival rates around 10–20%, surgery combined with
chemotherapy has increased the disease-free survival
rate to more than 60% [1]. However, despite aggressive
chemotherapy, more than 30% of patients with localized
osteosarcoma experience recurrent or progressive
metastatic disease, and the average survival period after

promote marked antitumor immunity and have shown
promising results in a subset of solid tumors, including
melanoma, lung cancer, and head and neck carcinomas
[6]. PD-L1 protein is expressed in a wide range of human
tumors [7]. In addition, studies on the relationship between
PD-L1 expression and the disease outcomes have shown
that PD-L1 expression significantly correlates with poor
prognosis in kidney, ovarian, bladder, breast, liver, gastric,
and pancreatic cancer [8]. Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1
pathway induced objective response rates of 6% to 17% and
prolonged stabilization of the disease in patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer [9].
Moreover, immunohistochemical assessment of PD-L1 in
pretreatment cancer specimens from 42 patients revealed
that response to treatment was observed exclusively in PDL1 positive tumors (9/25, 36%) [9]. Although the PD-1/
PD-L1 pathway is heavily targeted for anticancer drug
discovery, the functional and therapeutic roles of PD-L1
in osteosarcoma remain largely unknown. Our previous
study of PD-L1 RNA expression by quantitative real-time
RT-PCR showed that PD-L1 was expressed in over 80% of
osteosarcoma patient samples [10].
PD-1 and PD-L1 based cancer immunotherapies
normally require continuous treatment with antiPD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody, which may be costly.
Alternative therapeutic strategies of targeting PD-1 or
PD-L1 are needed. The clustered regulatory interspaced
short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-based RNAguided DNA endonuclease technology has been widely
adopted for its affordability, versatility, ease of use,
and low cost [11, 12]. CRISPR/Cas9 provides a robust
and highly efficient novel genome editing tool, which
enables precise manipulation of specific genomic loci,
and facilitates elucidation of target gene functions or
diseases [13]. This tool has successfully been applied to
induce manipulation of induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPS), genome editing, and gene therapy studies [14–16].
The clinical trial of T-cell modulation by CRISPR/Cas9
in cancer immunotherapy will be performed in 2017 [17].
In this study, we detected the expressions of PD-L1
protein in osteosarcoma cell lines and patient specimens. We
also evaluated the association between PD-L1 expression
and clinical characteristics in osteosarcoma patients.
The efficiency of a CRISPR/Cas9 system on disruption
of PD-L1 expression was assessed in osteosarcoma
cells. Furthermore, the effects of PD-L1 knockout on
osteosarcoma cell growth, migration, invasion, and drug
resistance to doxorubicin and paclitaxel were determined.

However, PD-L1 expression in osteosarcoma remains
unclear. In this study, we examined PD-L1 expression
in a tissue microarray of patient tumors. Among the
available specimens, 97 of 114 (85.1%) exhibited PD-L1
immunostaining in the cytoplasm, ranging from no
staining (15 of 97, 15.5%), 1+ staining (43 of 97,
44.3%), 2+ staining (18 of 97, 18.6%), and 3+ staining
(21 of 97, 21.6%); 17 specimens were not counted due
to tissue loss on the TMA slide. Based on PD-L1 staining
intensities in tumor samples, no staining (0) and weak
staining (1+) specimens were classified as PD-L1-low
(59.8%); moderate staining (2+) and intense staining
(3+) were classified as PD-L1-high (40.2%) (Figure 1A).
We observed that patients with metastasis have higher
expressions of PD-L1 than non-metastatic patients. We
next examined six osteosarcoma cell lines by Western
blotting. PD-L1 was detected in most of the osteosarcoma
cell lines. Among those osteosarcoma cell lines, MNNG/
HOS and 143B, which are highly tumorigenic and
metastatic, displayed the most abundant expression of
PD-L1. In normal human osteoblast cell lines (HOB-c
and NHOST), PD-L1 expression was extremely low
and almost undetectable (Figure 1B). Therefore, PD-L1
protein is widely expressed and may be associated
with metastasis both in osteosarcoma cell lines and in
osteosarcoma patients.

Correlation between PD-L1 and clinical
characteristics in osteosarcoma patients
There were significant differences in PD-L1
expression in patient samples comparing absent metastasis
and present metastasis (P < 0.001). In addition, patients
with high expression of PD-L1 had a trend of poor
response to preoperative chemotherapy (P = 0.1642).
However, there were no significant relationship between
PD-L1 expression and the other clinic pathological
features of the human tumor samples, such as age, gender,
or the recurrence (Table 1). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed
that osteosarcoma patients in the high PD-L1 expression
group had a lower overall survival rate compared with
patients in the low PD-L1 expression group (P = 0.0048)
(Figure 1C). Meanwhile, compared with low expression
of PD-L1, patients with high expression of PD-L1
possessed a worse five-year survival rate (P < 0.001).
Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated that PD-L1
expression was the independent prognostic factor of
overall and five-year survival rates (P = 0.045 and 0.009)
(Supplementary Table 1). Taking these data together, we
found that there was a close relationship between PD-L1
expression and clinic pathological features (especially
metastasis) of osteosarcoma.

osteosarcoma cell lines and patients

Construction and verification of PD-L1 CRISPR/
Cas9 in vitro

Generation of osteosarcoma cell lines with
constitutive knockout of PD-L1 expression

Before the transfection of plasmid with different
sgRNA into osteosarcoma cells, verification of PD-L1
CRISPR/Cas9 in vitro was performed. A sgRNA consists
of a crRNA sequence that binds to a specific DNA target,
and a tracrRNA sequence that binds to Cas9 protein. When
a sgRNA binds to a recombinant form of the Cas9 protein
that has double-stranded DNA endonuclease activity, the
resulting complex will produce target-specific doublestranded cleavage. Cellular repair, which is error-prone,
will take place at the cleavage site, and may result in a
mutation that can knock out a gene. In Figure 2A, all of
the five designed sgRNAs showed a 140bp PCR product
as expect. In Figure 2B, similar to the positive control, all
five of the sgRNA plus Cas9 could cut the specific DNA
sequence from PD-L1 into two parts. In Figure 2C, the
PD-L1 expression was knocked out both in KHOS-PD-L1Cas9 and in MNNG/HOS-PD-L1-Cas9 cells, while there
were no changes in PD-L1 expression in KHOS-pEGFP
and MNNG/HOS-pEGFP cells. These data demonstrated
that each of the PD-L1 CRISPR/Cas9 constructs could
effectively target the PD-L1 gene.

According to the results of in vitro verification, we
chose two different sgRNAs (#2 and #3) individually
targeting at exon 2 and 3 of PD-L1 gene for the generation
of osteosarcoma cell lines with constitutive knockout of
PD-L1 expression. Transfection of osteosarcoma cells
(KHOS and MNNG/HOS) with PD-L1 CRISPR/Cas9
plasmid and GFP resulted in transfection of approximately
50–75% of the cells as observed by green fluorescence
(Figure 3A). Subsequently, FACS cell sorting was
performed based on GFP expression (Figure 3B) and
enabled enrichment of PD-L1 knock out cells (Figure 3C).
The effectiveness of PD-L1 CRISPR/Cas9 was evaluated
by the expression of PD-L1 protein. After four passages,
three out of six clones generated from the FACS sorted
and cultured cells showed complete loss of PD-L1
expression (KHOS clone #2, MNNG/HOS clone #2, and
MNNG/HOS clone #3). In Figure 2D, KHOS clone #1 and
#2 show partial loss of PD-L1 expression, and MNNG/
HOS clone #1 shows no effect on PD-L1 expression. This
maintenance of significant inhibition of PD-L1 expression
leads us to consider KHOS clone #2, MNNG/HOS clone
#2, and MNNG/HOS clone #3 as the atypical knockout
that precluded further characterization.

images of different immunohistochemical staining intensities of PD-L1 are shown in osteosarcoma tissues. The percentage of cells showing
positive cytoplasmic staining for PD-L1 was calculated by reviewing the entire spot. Based on the PD-L1 staining intensities in the tumor

staining (3+) (Original magnification, 400×). (B) Expression of PD-L1 protein in osteosarcoma cell lines and normal osteoblast cell lines.

Knockout of PD-L1 expression by PD-L1
CRISPR/Cas9 inhibits osteosarcoma cell drug
resistance to doxorubicin and paclitaxel

in clinical treatment.

Knockout of PD-L1 expression by CRISPR/Cas9
inhibits osteosarcoma cell spheroid formation in
3D culture

Doxorubicin and paclitaxel are commonly used
in the treatment of osteosarcoma. However, there are
many osteosarcoma patients resistant to doxorubicin and
paclitaxel chemotherapy. In this study, the MTT assay was
applied to evaluate the role of PD-L1 in the osteosarcoma
cell drug resistance to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. The
IC50 of doxorubicin in KHOS PD-L1-Cas9 was 0.030 µM
and the IC50 of doxorubicin in KHOS was 0.092 µM
(Figure 4A). Meanwhile, the IC50 of doxorubicin in
MNNG/HOS PD-L1-Cas9 was 0.0705 µM and the IC50 of
doxorubicin in MNNG/HOS was 0.1152 µM (Figure 4B).
The results of paclitaxel in osteosarcoma cells remain
the same. The IC50 of paclitaxel in KHOS PD-L1-Cas9
was 0.00026 µM and the IC50 in KHOS was 0.00113 µM
(Figure 4C). The IC50 of paclitaxel in MNNG/HOS PDL1-Cas9 was 0.00092 µM and the IC50 in MNNG/HOS
was 0.0020 µM (Figure 4D). The results of the MTT
assay demonstrated that PD-L1 may take part in the drug
resistance of osteosarcoma and might be a potential target
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In order to mimic the in vivo environment and detect
the effect of PD-L1 on osteosarcoma tumorigenicity, a 3D
cell culture was performed. Osteosarcoma cells without
treatments were considered as control. After seven days
of culture in 3D, the diameter of KHOS spheroids formed
by PD-L1 CRISPR/Cas9 intervention was 68% of control
cells, which was relatively smaller than blank controls
(P = 0.008). Similar results were seen in MNNG/HOS
cells. The diameter of MNNG/HOS spheroids formed by
PD-L1 CRISPR/Cas9 intervention was 64% of control
cells (P = 0.012) (Figure 4E and 4F). Thereby, the results
suggest that PD-L1 CRISPR/Cas9 significantly depressed
the growth and tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cells.

Knockout of PD-L1 expression by PD-L1
CRISPR/Cas9 showed no significant effects on
osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion

of invading cells of KHOS PD-L1-Cas9 and MNNG/
HOS PD-L1-Cas9 decreased compared with KHOS and
MNNG/HOS cells (Figure 5D). These data suggest that
migration and invasion might not be mediated by PD-L1
in osteosarcoma.

Migration and invasion capabilities are crucial
prerequisites for metastatic osteosarcoma. In this study,
we evaluated whether knockout of PD-L1 expression
could affect the migratory and invasive activities of
osteosarcoma cells by the wound healing assay and
Matrigel invasion assay. In the wound healing assay,
wounds were almost recovered after 24 hours of migration
both in blank control cells and KHOS PD-L1-Cas9 and
MNNG/HOS PD-L1-Cas9 cells (Figure 5A). In Matrigel
invasion assays, the average number of osteosarcoma cells
that invaded through the Matrigel showed no significant
differences between CRISPR/Cas9 cells and blank
control cells. However, there was a trend that the numbers

DISCUSSION
In this study, we successfully established a PD-L1
CRISPR/Cas9 system and generated osteosarcoma cell
lines with constitutive knockout of PD-L1 expression.
By CRISPR/Cas9 system, PD-L1 has been verified to
mediate osteosarcoma cell, growth and drug resistance to
doxorubicin and paclitaxel. In addition, PD-L1 expression
was also confirmed to be associated with metastasis in
osteosarcoma and can be considered as a predictor for fiveyear and overall survival in osteosarcoma patients. This is

the first report demonstrating the PD-L1 CRISPR/Cas9
system in osteosarcoma, which offers a new treatment
approach for PD-L1 in osteosarcoma.
It is well-known that the immune regulatory
receptor PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 are important
mechanisms of tumor immune tolerance and escape.
PD-1 is a cell-surface receptor expressed on subsets
of T and B lymphocytes, as well as on other immune
cells. PD-L1 is a transmembrane protein expressed on
antigen present cells (APC), such as on various cancer
cells. The PD-1/PD-L1 complex transmits an inhibitory
signal, which reduces the proliferation of CD8+ T
cells at the lymph nodes and suppresses the immune
response [20]. Previously, we demonstrated that high
levels of PD-L1 mRNA are expressed in osteosarcoma,
and that PD-L1 mRNA expression is positively correlated
with tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs), which is
regarded as a marker of metastasis [10]. In chordoma,
the expression of PD-L1 protein has also been found to
be associated with the presence of elevated TILs [21].
However, the role of PD-L1 protein directly in biological
functions of osteosarcoma cell lines remains unclear.
This study provides new evidence for the role of PD-L1

in osteosarcoma. We evaluated different osteosarcoma
cell lines and osteoblast cell lines. Both the cell line and
patient data demonstrate that PD-L1 may be involved in
osteosarcoma biological features, especially metastasis.
We observed by Western blot that PD-L1 was widely
expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines as compared with
osteoblast cell lines. Furthermore, the richest expression
of PD-L1 was shown in the osteosarcoma cell lines
with the highest tumorigenesis and metastatic potential
(MNNG/HOS and 143B). Correspondingly, PD-L1
protein expression exhibited predominantly cytoplasmic
staining and was detected in most patient specimens of
the TMA assay. Moreover, there was a close relationship
between PD-L1 expression and metastasis. The expression
of PD-L1 protein was even an independent risk factor of
metastasis in osteosarcoma patients. This was similar to
studies on oral squamous cell carcinoma. Those patients
with distant metastasis had high expression of PD-L1,
which was analyzed by immunohistochemistry [18].
Another study with 107 cases of human gastric carcinoma
suggested that high expression of PD-L1 was a risk factor
and a new biomarker to predict the prognosis of gastric
cancer. In their study, PD-L1 expression was significantly

associated with depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis,
pathological type, and overall survival [19]. Thus, these
data contain important implications for the application of
PD-L1 therapies in osteosarcoma treatment, especially in
patients with metastasis.
The immune therapeutics targeting the PD-1/PD-L1
axis in cancer patients with a wide variety of malignancies
is rapidly evolving with successful clinical studies [22].
Recently, the FDA approved the PD-1 antibodies,
pembrolizumab and nivolumab, for the treatment of
advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer
[23, 24]. Due to the uncertainty of clinical effectiveness
and expensive cost of PD-L1 antibodies, finding other
effective therapeutic strategies to target PD-L1 is still
necessary. CRISPR/Cas9 is a very useful genomic editing
tool and has been successfully applied to the treatment of
some diseases. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a prokaryotic
immune system that confers resistance to foreign genetic
elements such as plasmids and phages, and provides a
form of acquired immunity. CRISPR spacers recognize
and cut these exogenous genetic elements in a manner

analogous to RNA interference in eukaryotic organisms.
As it accurately targets DNA and is a genetically heritable
modification, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely
used for gene editing (adding, disrupting, or changing the
sequence of specific genes) and gene regulation in species
throughout life [11, 12]. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 offers
great promise for targeting different stages of the viral life
cycle, and has the capacity for mediating an effective and
sustained genetic therapy against HBV and HIV [25, 26].
Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of some
key oncogenes has been demonstrated to decrease the
malignant potential of prostate cancer cells, and inhibit
tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis in triple-negative
breast cancer [27, 28]. Our study applied the CRISPR/
Cas9 system to cleave PD-L1 expression in osteosarcoma
cells. The position of the PD-L1 sgRNA target is located
on exon 2 and 3 of the PD-L1 gene. In this study, the
efficiency of sgRNA was first powerfully confirmed
in vitro. The efficient enrichment of cells enabled the
isolation of permanent cell lines expressing the mutations
via fluorescent cell sorting. These results demonstrate

that PD-L1 sgRNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 is able to
specifically knockout PD-L1 expression. Meanwhile,
the establishment of a constitutive PD-L1 knockout cell
line offers a good model for the study of osteosarcoma
pathology and provides a good basis for the application
of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in osteosarcoma treatment.
Our data also confirm that the CRISPR/Cas9 system
for genome editing is a robust technology that makes it
possible to generate cellular models that recapitulate those
cooperative alterations rapidly and at low cost.
With the application of CRISPR/Cas9 by PD-L1
sgRNA, we found that PD-L1 was an important factor
involved in osteosarcoma cell growth and drug resistance.
In order to mimic the in vivo environment of osteosarcoma
cell growth, 3D cell culture was applied in this study.
The diameter of spheroids formed by PD-L1-Cas9 cells
was significantly decreased compared with the control
cells, which implied that PD-L1 might also be involved
in the growth and tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cells.
As migration and invasion capabilities are crucial
prerequisites for metastatic osteosarcoma, we compared
those functions between PD-L1 knockout cells and control
cells. However, there were no significant differences

between PD-L1 knockout cells and control cells. Our
result showed that migration and invasion of osteosarcoma
might not be mediated by PD-L1 alone, but by cell growth
or by the PD-1/PD-L1 complex. The function of PD-L1
may be related to the PD-1/PD-L1 complex, which
transmits an inhibitory signal to reduce the proliferation
of CD8+ T cells [20]. With similar results, positive PD-L1
protein expression was considered as an independent
predictor for colorectal carcinoma prognosis. Knockdown
of PD-L1 can inhibit colorectal carcinoma cell
proliferation [29]. Beside metastasis, PD-L1 expression
has also been considered as an adequate biomarker to
predict responsiveness to these therapies in some cancers.
PD-L1 expression in the epithelium or stroma of breast
cancer patients predicted complete pathologic response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in univariate and multivariate
analyses [30]. In lymphoma tissue and cell lines, PD-L1
is highly and widely expressed and it may resist the
effects of cisplatin on lymphoma cells through antiapoptotic mechanisms [31]. Consistent with those data,
our study showed that PD-L1 played an important role in
osteosarcoma cell reaction to chemotherapy. Compared with
the control osteosarcoma cells, PD-L1-Cas9 cells showed

lower values of IC50 for both doxorubicin and paclitaxel.
Taking these data together, we propose that PD-L1
may take part in the drug resistance and tumorigenicity of
osteosarcoma, and thereby might be a potential target in
clinical treatment.
This study confirms that PD-L1 is highly expressed
in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues. Moreover, this
is the first application of CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the
PD-L1 gene in osteosarcoma. Furthermore, we have
successfully established the PD-L1 CRISPR/Cas9 system
and generated osteosarcoma cell lines with constitutive
knockout of PD-L1 expression. With the simplicity and
flexibility of CRISPR/Cas9, it is expected that the PD-L1
CRISPR/Cas9 system may be a promising therapeutic
approach for the treatment of osteosarcoma in the future.

Osteosarcoma and osteoblast cells were lysed
with RIPA Lysis Buffer (Upstate Biotechnology,
Charlottesville, VA) plus complete protease inhibitor
cocktail tablets (Roche Applied Science, IN). Protein
concentrations were calculated by the Bio-Rad Protein
Assay (Bio-Rad, CA). Antibodies against PD-L1 (1:1000
dilution), Cas9 (1:1000 dilution) were purchased from
Abcam, and β-actin (1:2000 dilution) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Secondary antibodies
IRDye® 800CW and IRDye® 680LT were obtained from
LI-COR (Biosciences, NE). Western blot analysis was
performed as previously reported [35]. Western blot
detection and quantitation was performed by the Odyssey
infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, NE).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid design and purification

Cell lines and culture

The CRISPR/Cas9 and green fluorescent protein
(GFP) fusion protein expression vector guided by PD-L1
single guide RNA (sgRNA) (abbreviated as PD-L1Cas9-GFP) was obtained from DNA 2.0 (Newark,
CA). GFP is co-expressed from the same mRNA as
the Cas9 protein via a NLS peptide linkage, which
enables tracking of transfection efficiency. The exon
of the PD-L1 gene selected for guiding RNA design is
located at the second and third coding exons. The oligo
nucleotides used for construction of the PD-L1 gene
sgRNA are: 5′AGCAAATATCCTCATCTTTC3′NGG
(#1); 5′TCTTTATATTCATGACCTAC3′NGG (#2);
5′ ATTTACTGTCACGGTTCCCA 3′NGG (#3);
5′ TACCATACTCTACCACATAT3′NGG (#4); 5′
AATAGACAATTAGTGCAGCC3′NGG (#5).

The human osteoblast cells NHOst and HOB-c were
purchased from Lonza Walkersville (Walkersville, MD)
and PromoCell GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany),
respectively. The human osteosarcoma cell lines, U-2OS,
SaOS, MG63, MNNG/HOS, and 143B were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).
The human osteosarcoma KHOS cell line was kindly
provided by Dr. Efstathios Gonos (Institute of Biological
Research & Biotechnology, Athens, Greece). The
osteosarcoma cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The
osteoblast cell lines were cultured in osteoblast growth
medium (PromoCell) with 10% fetal bovine serum.
All cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere at 37°C.

Verification of PD-L1 CRISPR/Cas9 in vitro
In order to verify the effectiveness of the PD-L1
sgRNA, we performed the genome editing with “Guide-it
technology”. The “Guide-it sgRNA In Vitro Transcription
and Screening Systems” kit was purchased from Clontech
Laboratories Inc. (CA). Firstly, a DNA template that
contained the sgRNA encoding sequence under the
control of a T7 promoter was generated by performing
a PCR with the included Guide-it Scaffold Template and
the designed primer. The template was then transcribed
with the included Guide-it T7 Polymerase Mix to
create a sgRNA containing the target PD-L1 sequence.
Subsequently, we purified the sgRNA using digestion
with DNAseI, phenol: chloroform extraction, and ethanol
precipitation, and measured the concentration. After that,
the cleavage template that contained the target sequence in
an asymmetric position was expanded by PCR. A cleavage
reaction on this template was then performed by using the
purified sgRNA in combination with the included Guideit Recombinant Cas9 Nuclease. Finally, the efficiency of

Osteosarcoma tissue microarray (TMA) and
immunohistochemical staining
Osteosarcoma TMAs were generated as described
previously [32, 33]. PD-L1 expression was evaluated
by immunohistochemistry as previously described [34].
Primary PD-L1 antibody (1:50 dilution, Abcam, MA)
was incubated with the TMA at 4°C overnight in a
humidified chamber. Expression of PD-L1 was evaluated
according to staining intensities in the cytoplasm of tumor
samples. Thereby, staining patterns were categorized
into four groups: no staining (0) and weak staining (1+)
specimens, which were classified as PD-L1-low patients;
and moderate staining (2+) and intense staining (3+),
which were classified as PD-L1-high patients. PD-L1
staining images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U
fluorescence microscope (Nikon Corp) with a SPOT RT
digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.).

cell growth. Following the manufacturer’s protocol,
osteosarcoma cell spheroid formation was established
in HDP1096 Perfecta3D® 96-Well Hanging Drop Plates
(3D Biomatrix). Hanging drops were formed by pipetting
40 μL of cell suspension (1 × 105/mL) into each well.
Medium was changed every other day to provide enough
nutrients for cells and to prevent osmolality shift of the
medium. After seven days culture, the spheroids were
harvested from the bottom side of the plate by gently
pipetting 100 μL PBS into each well. After 15 minutes of
incubation with 1 μM Calcein AM (Life Technologies), the
spheroids were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U inverted
fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments, Inc NY, CA).
The size of spheroids was calculated using ImageJ.

Monoclone and PD-L1 verification
The stable osteosarcoma cell lines (KHOS and
MNNG/HOS) were transfected with the specific PD-L1Cas9-GFP vector using Lipofectamine3000 (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and the cells were allowed to recover for
48  hours before fluorescence activated cell sorting
(FACS). Forty-eight hours after transfection, delivery
of sgRNA plasmids was confirmed by visualizing green
fluorescent marker expression by fluorescence microscopy.
Cells dispersed from the culture plate were pelleted and
resuspended in 1ml PBS. Using FACS, green fluorescent
cells were collected. Individual GFP-positive cells were
diluted to 5 cells/ml and the clones in 96-well plates were
allowed to expand for seven days. Westernblot was used
to identify PD-L1 protein expression and to confirm the
cell clones with constitutively knockout PD-L1 expression
after FACS. The clones confirmed with constitutive
knockout of PD-L1 expression were used for the following
functional assays.

Matrigel invasion assay
Matrigel invasion assay was applied to evaluate the
role of PD-L1 in the process of osteosarcoma metastasis.
BioCoat™ Matrigel™ Invasion Chambers (BectonDickinson, MA) were used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Osteosarcoma cells (5 × 104 cells/plate)
were planted into the upper chamber of each well in
serum-free medium, and complete medium was put into
the bottom chamber. After incubation for 24 hours, noninvaded cells were removed by scrubbing from the upper
surface of the membrane with cotton-tipped swabs. After
fixation in 100% methanol and staining with hematoxylin,
the invaded cells were counted in three images of each
membrane under a microscope using a 200× objective.

Drug resistance evaluation by MTT cell
proliferation assay
Doxorubicin and paclitaxel, which are the most
common chemotherapy choices for osteosarcoma
treatment, were provided by the pharmacy at the
Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. The stock
solutions of these drugs were prepared according to the
manufacturers’ specifications and stored at −20°C. Effects
of PD-L1 on osteosarcoma drug resistance to doxorubicin
and paclitaxel were assessed by the MTT assay. In 96well plates, 5 × 103 cells/mL (including KHOS, KHOS
PD-L1-Cas9, MNNG/HOS, or MNNG/HOS PD-L1Cas9 cells) were seeded into each well. Complete growth
medium without antibiotics was added into each well to a
volume of 100 μL in triplicate. Osteosarcoma cells were
dosed with doxorubicin in increasing concentration up
to10 µM or paclitaxel in increasing concentrations up to
1 µM. After 96 hours of culture, 20 µL of MTT (5 mg/mL)
was added to each well and the cells were incubated
for 4 hours at 37°C. Absorbance at a wave length of
490 nm was measured on a SPECTR Amax Microplate
Spectrophotometer from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale,
CA). All results were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 5
software (San Diego, CA).

Wound healing migration assay
Migration activity is another method to identify the
potential role of PD-L1 in the metastasis of osteosarcoma.
In this study, migration activity was detected by the
multiple scratch wound assay. Osteosarcoma cells
(1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into 12-well plates. Three
parallel lines were made in confluent cell cultures with a
200 μL tip. The wounds were observed at 0, 8, and 24 hours
after scratching separately, and photographed at each time
point using a 10× objective. The cell migration distance
was defined as the wound width at the 0 h time point minus
the wound width at each time point and then divided by
two. The distance between the two edges of the wound
width was randomly quantified at 10 sites in each image.

Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism5 software (GraphPad Software,
Inc.) was used for statistical analyses. Results are
expressed as mean ± SD and P values < 0.05 were
regarded as statistically significant. We used the χ2 test
to analyze the relationship between PD-L1 expression
and clinic pathological parameters of osteosarcoma. The
log-rank test was used to compare the differences in
survival curves. Prognostic factors associated with overall
