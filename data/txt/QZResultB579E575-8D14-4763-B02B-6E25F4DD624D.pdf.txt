Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Protein kinase C (PKC) ε, a member of the novel PKC family, plays key roles in mitogenesis and
survival in normal and cancer cells. PKCε is frequently overexpressed in epithelial cancers,
particularly in lung cancer. Using a shRNA approach, here we established that PKCε is required
for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) growth in vitro as well as tumor growth when
inoculated into athymic mice. Moreover, sustained delivery of a PKCε selective inhibitor peptide,
εV1-2, reduced xenograft growth in mice. Both RNAi depletion and pharmacological inhibition of
PKCε caused a marked elevation in the number of apoptotic cells in NSCLC tumors. PKCεdepleted NSCLC cells show elevated expression of pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family,
caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins, and TNF ligands/receptor superfamily
members. Moreover, a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that a vast majority of the
genes changed in PKCε-depleted cells were also deregulated in human NSCLC. Our results
strongly suggest that PKCε is required for NSCLC cell survival and maintenance of NSCLC
tumor growth. Therefore, PKCε may represent an attractive therapeutic target for NSCLC.

Introduction
Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes comprise 3 classes of serine-threonine kinases (“classical”
cPKCα, β, γ, “novel” nPKCs δ, ε, η, θ, and “atypical” aPKCζ and ι/λ) that play important
roles in the control of cellular growth, survival, differentiation and transformation. Their
cooperation with oncogenic stimuli such as Ras, Myc and Fos, is well established (Barr et
al., 1991; Han et al., 1995; Hsiao et al., 1989). Despite the extensive knowledge on PKC
signaling, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the striking functional specificity
displayed by PKC isozymes. Depending on the cellular context, individual members of the
DAG/phorbol ester regulated cPKC and nPKC classes modulate cellular responses either in

cooperative or antagonistic manners. Studies have shown that PKCα and PKCδ generally
inhibit cell cycle progression or promote apoptotic and senescent responses, whereas PKCε
mediates mitogenic responses (Black, 2000; Brodie & Blumberg, 2003; Caino et al., 2009;
Nakagawa et al., 2005; Oliva et al., 2008; Slupsky et al., 2007). In addition, activation of
PKCε inhibits apoptotic responses triggered by a number of stimuli through both Aktdependent and Akt-independent mechanisms (Basu & Sivaprasad, 2007; Lu et al., 2006;
McJilton et al., 2003; Okhrimenko et al., 2005). The diversity and heterogeneity in PKC
isozyme function in distinct cell types may largely explain the limited therapeutic success of
PKC inhibitors which in most cases fail to discriminate between PKC isozymes.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The expression of PKC isozymes and their effectors is altered in human cancer. One of the
most frequent alterations in tumors of epithelial origin is the overexpression of PKCε,
particularly in lung, prostate, and breast cancer. PKCε up-regulation in tumors was defined
as a prognostic marker for recurrence and patient survival (Gorin & Pan, 2009; Griner &
Kazanietz, 2007). Ectopic expression of PKCε in non-transformed epithelial cells leads to
either growth advantage or a transformed phenotype (Mischak et al., 1993; Perletti et al.,
1996). A recent study revealed that transgenic overexpression of PKCε in the mouse
prostate confers a preneoplastic phenotype (Benavides et al., 2011). In the mouse skin,
transgenic overexpression of PKCε leads to metastatic squamous carcinoma (Jansen et al.,
2001). Thus, despite cell type differences, it became clear that PKCε may have prominent
roles in cancer initiation and progression (Gorin & Pan, 2009).
Lung cancer is one of the malignancies in which the role of PKC isozymes is still poorly
understood. Studies from our laboratory revealed that PKCα and PKCδ promote antimitogenic responses in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells (Caino et al., 2009;
Nakagawa et al., 2005; Oliva et al., 2008). A study by Xiao and coworkers showed that
expression of a dominant-negative PKCε mutant inhibits the progression of NSCLC cells
through the cell cycle, suggesting that PKCε may have an important role in lung cancer
development (Bae et al., 2007). Moreover, PKCε inhibition resulted in a significant
amplification of the cytotoxic activity of TRAIL in A549 cells and increased their apoptotic
responsiveness (Farber et al., 2004). Notably, more than 90% of human NSCLC tumors
display elevated PKCε levels (Bae et al., 2007). Several oncogenic stimuli implicated in
lung cancer development, including the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) or K-Ras, signal
through the second messenger DAG, a key step for PKCε activation (Parker & Murray-Rust,
2004; Toker, 1998). It is therefore conceivable that PKCε plays a role in the maintenance of
the tumorigenic phenotype in lung cancer.

In this study we present strong evidence that PKCε is required for the growth of NSCLC
cells in vitro and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Moreover, we identified novel apoptosisrelated transcriptional targets for PKCε that correlate with disease status in NSCLC.

Results and discussion
PKCε depletion impairs anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent NSCLC cell
growth
Overexpression of PKCε, a member of the novel PKC family, is a hallmark of human
epithelial cancers particularly in NSCLC tumors (Bae et al., 2007; Griner & Kazanietz,
2007). We therefore speculated that this kinase plays a role in the maintenance of the
malignant phenotype in NSCLC cells. Analysis of PKCε expression in 4 different human
NSCLC cells (H358, A549, H441 and H322) revealed a remarkable overexpression of
PKCε relative to immortalized non-tumorigenic (HBEC3) cells (Fig. 1A), which fits with
observations in human lung cancer specimens. To establish a role of PKCε in growth and
tumorigenesis, we used a RNAi silencing approach. Each of the four NSCLC cell lines was

infected with PKCε shRNA lentiviruses or a non-target shRNA lentivirus and stable pools
selected with puromycin. Two different sequences (ε#1 and ε#2) were used in all cases to
minimize off-target effects. Expression of PKCε was reduced more than 75% by either
sequence without any noticeable change in the levels of the other DAG-responsive PKCs
present in these cells (PKCα and PKCδ) (Fig. 1B). Cell proliferation was significantly
reduced in all four NSCLC cell lines in which PKCε was stably depleted (Fig. 1C).
Moreover, assays of colony formation in liquid and semisolid medium revealed that both
anchorage-independent and anchorage-dependent growth were impaired in PKCε-depleted
H358 cells relative to control cells. Similar results were observed in A549 cells (Fig. 1D and
1E). These data suggest that PKCε may be important in NSCLC growth.
PKCε depletion inhibits NSCLC xenograft growth

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to assess the effect of PKCε depletion on the tumorigenic potential of NSCLC cells
in vivo, we injected s.c. into athymic nude mice H358 cell lines stably expressing either ε#1
shRNA, ε#2 shRNA, or control shRNA. Inoculation of control H358 cells led to the
formation of tumors with a latency of ~2 weeks. Notably, tumor growth of PKCε-depleted
cells was remarkably lower compared with control NSCLC cells (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of
tumor growth was more evident in NSCLC cells expressing shRNA ε#1, which shows near
complete depletion of PKCε. Immunohistochemical analysis of xenografts 15 days after
inoculation showed a marked induction of cell death in PKCε-depleted cells, as evidenced
by a large number of TUNEL positive cells (Fig. 2B).
Pharmacological inhibition of PKCε impairs NSCLC tumor growth
PKC isozymes have been extensively studied as therapeutic targets, and several modulators
of PKC activity have been examined in clinical trials for multiple malignancies (Barry &
Kazanietz, 2001; Goekjian & Jirousek, 2001; Serova et al., 2006). Surprisingly, despite the
established relevance of PKCε in mitogenesis and survival there are no studies to date
examining PKCε as a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer. This may be partly due to
the lack of kinase inhibitors with selectivity towards PKCε. Indeed, most ATP-binding site
directed inhibitors fail to discriminate between PKC isozymes and/or have additional
kinases as targets (Bain et al., 2003; Bain et al., 2007; Davies et al., 2000; Mochly-Rosen &
Kauvar, 1998). We decided to take advantage of εV1-2, a peptide that specifically inhibits
PKCε translocation without affecting the activation of other PKC isozymes (Begley et al.,
2004; Felber et al., 2007). This PKCε inhibitor has been successfully delivered as a TATfused protein into cellular models as well as into mice and rats (Budas et al., 2007; Gray et
al., 1997; Inagaki et al., 2005; Koyanagi et al., 2007).

H358 xenografts were implanted s.c. in athymic mice and when tumors reached
approximately 100 mm3 animals were randomized into two groups that received either
εV1-2 conjugated to TAT or control TAT (18 mg/kg/day) by osmotic minipumps. Previous
studies have found that administration of εV1-2 for 5 weeks at 20 mg/kg/day does not cause
cytotoxic or systemic effects to mice (Koyanagi et al., 2007). Osmotic minipumps were
replaced every 7 days and tumor growth was followed for 3 weeks. As shown in Fig. 2C,
delivery of εV1-2 into nude mice greatly reduced H358 xenograft growth.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed a strong induction of cell death (TUNEL positive
cells) in tumors from mice that received εV1-2. On the other hand, there were essentially no
TUNEL-positive cells in tumors from animals that received the control TAT peptide (Fig.
2D). These results strongly argue for a role for PKCε in NSCLC tumor cell survival.

Ras oncogenesis, and transformation were identified (Caino et al., 2011). Given that PKCε
loss-of-function induces cell death in NSCLC xenografts we sought to determine whether
PKCε regulates the expression of apoptotic/survival genes. Using a Human Apoptosis array
(QIAGEN) we compared the mRNA levels of key apoptosis-related genes in control vs.
PKCε-depleted cells. A 1.5-fold cut-off value (PKCε/control) was used. This analysis
revealed that PKCε depletion increased mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic proteins Bak1,
Bcl2A1, Bcl2L10, Bik and HRK (Table 1). PKCε depletion was associated with a
significant decrease in the expression of the pro-survival protein Bcl-2 and the inhibitor of
apoptosis cIAP-2 (Fig. 3A and data not shown). In addition, PKCε-depleted cells expressed
higher levels of caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins (Bag4, CARD8)
and caspases (CASP2, CASP3, CASP4 and CASP6) relative to control cells. Several ligands
and receptors of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily were also elevated as a consequence
of PKCε depletion (Table 1). In order to validate the results from the array, 11 genes were
selected. Fig. 3A shows that in all cases the changes observed in the array could be
recapitulated using qPCR. Several of these genes were further validated by Western blot
(Fig. 3B). These results suggest that PKCε plays an important role in the modulation of
genes involved in cell survival and raise the possibility that they contribute to the
susceptibility to apoptosis upon PKCε depletion.

To further investigate the relevance of PKCε target genes in NSCLC, we carried out a
comprehensive analysis of publicly available human lung cancer datasets. A comparison of
PKCε mRNA levels in human lung adenocarcinomas (LAC) vs. normal lung (NL) tissue
using the Oncomine repository revealed marked up-regulation in LAC (fold change=2.5,
p<0.05, Beer Lung study). Remarkably, the vast majority of the genes with expression
altered in PKCε-depleted cells were deregulated in LAC (Table 1 and Tables S1–S2). As
expected, pro-apoptotic genes up-regulated in PKCε-depleted cells were down-regulated in
LAC, whereas pro-survival genes down-regulated in PKCε-depleted cells were up-regulated
in LAC. Furthermore, a meta-analysis from all available studies for each gene revealed that
expression changes in LAC vs. NL were statistically significant for 27 of the PKCεregulated genes (21 genes down-regulated and 6 genes up-regulated in LAC) (Table 1).
Based on these results we defined a set for genes regulated negatively by PKCε that passed
the threshold of statistical significance p<0.05 that we named “PKCε-gene set”.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to gain biological insight from these gene expression studies and determining a
potential correlation between the expression of PKCε-regulated genes and disease status, we
carried out a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using as a query the above defined
PKCε-gene set. Interestingly, a significant correlation was found between down-regulation
of PKCε-regulated genes and LAC samples (p<1 ×10−8 and FDR <0.001). Among the genes
negatively correlated with LAC (enrichment score, ES<0) we found FAS, CASP4, CD40,
BIRC2, CASP1, TRAIL (TNFSF10), MCL1 and BNIP3L (Table 1, GSEA column). In
summary, this analysis identified novel apoptosis-related PKCε transcriptional targets
associated with NSCLC, suggesting an important role for PKCε in the inhibition of proapoptotic genes.

Final conclusions
Our studies clearly show that overexpression of PKCε is a key driving force in the growth
and tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells. PKCε depletion or pharmacological inhibition reduced
tumor growth and enhanced tumor cell death, as demonstrated also in cell models in vitro. A
key mechanism by which PKCε may sustain tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells is via
modulation of the expression of apoptotic genes. A point that illustrates the relevance of our
findings is that the majority of the PKCε apoptotic target genes are down-regulated in
human NSCLC samples. Moreover, current unpublished studies from our laboratory suggest

that PKCε is a key modulator of transcriptional networks of genes that dictate cell fate
(M.C.C. and M.G.K., unpublished observations). Conceivably, targeting PKCε may
reinstate altered transcriptional patterns displayed by NSCLC cells that contribute to disease
development.

One of the outstanding questions raised by this study is the utility of PKCε as a therapeutic
target. Our results suggest that PKCε is required for survival of tumor cells and that PKCε
depletion of inhibition is sufficient to inhibit tumor growth of lung cancer cells. Three major
issues are raised by these results that required ample investigation. The first is the
mechanism that leads to PKCε up-regulation in lung cancer (or other epithelial cancers).
Preliminary data from our laboratory suggest that deregulation occurs at a transcriptional
level and possibly through enhanced protein stability (Wang H.B., Lu H., and M.G.K.,
unpublished observations). Second, it remains to be determined whether PKCε plays a role
in the initiation of lung cancer and whether its overexpression cooperates with other
oncogenic alterations characteristic of the disease. Lastly, it would be important to establish
whether overexpression of PKCε also involves its hyperactivation. Conceivable, oncogenic
alterations that occur in lung cancer lead to enhanced generation of DAG, the physiological
PKCε activator. For example, mutant K-Ras is known to elevate cellular DAG levels
(Fleischman et al., 1986; Matyas & Fishman, 1989; Preiss et al., 1986). EGFR, which is
overexpressed/hyperactivated in 50–90% of human lung tumors (Sekido et al., 2003),
couples to phospholipase Cγ, a key enzyme responsible for DAG generation (Paez et al.,
2004; Pao et al., 2004; Parker & Murray-Rust, 2004; Rusch et al., 1993; Toker, 1998).
Moreover, EGFR signals to PDK-1, a PIP3-dependent kinase required for the maturation of
PKCε (Parker & Murray-Rust, 2004; Toker, 1998). Both K-Ras and EGFR are established
drivers of survival signals (Lemmon & Schlessinger, 2010; Malumbres & Barbacid, 2003),
but the implication of PKCε in these responses remains to be determined. Whether other
common oncogenic alterations in lung cancer, such as bFGF and VEGF overexpression, or
PI3K, p53 and Pten mutations (Sekido et al., 2003), lead to PKCε activation, needs to be
established. Our data therefore warrant the analysis of signals leading to PKCε activation
and up-regulation in lung cancer cells. Dissecting these mechanisms may help determining
the potential of PKCε as a therapeutic target for different subsets of lung cancers or establish
new regimens of combined therapy.

Fig. 1. PKCε is required for the growth of NSCLC cells

A) PKCε expression was analyzed by Western blot in immortalized non-tumorigenic
(HBEC3) and NSCLC-derived cell lines (H358, H441, H322 and A549). Cells lines were
obtained from ATCC and grown as recommended by the provider. An anti-PKCε antibody
(Santa Cruz) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. B) Cells were infected with shRNA lentiviruses

A) H358 cells expressing shRNA control (CTRL) or PKCε (ε#1 and ε#2) at 80%
confluency were resuspended in serum-free medium, and then 0.1 ml containing 5 ×106
cells were injected s.c. into the flank of male athymic nude-Foxn1nu mice (Harlan
Laboratories). The width and length of tumors were measured with a caliper at different
times, and tumor volume calculated as Vol=π x width2 x length/6. Inset, PKCε levels at the
day of inoculation. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. (n=10). *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; ***,

for immunohistochemistry, 15 days post-inoculation. Upper panels, H&E staining, lower
panels, TUNEL labeling. C) H358 cells were injected s.c. in the flank of athymic mice (5
×106 cells/mice). When tumors reached ~100 mm3 (~ 20 days post-inoculation) animals
were randomized into two groups and subject to treatment with either control carrier peptide
(TAT) or εV1-2 with TAT (18 mg/kg/day). Peptide delivery was achieved by weekly
subcutaneous implantation of osmotic minipumps in the opposite flank. Tumor volume was
expressed as the mean ± S.E.M. (n=8). *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01. A second experiment gave
similar results. D) Tumors were removed 15 days after the beginning of treatment and

H358 cells expressing shRNA control (CTRL) or shRNA for PKCε (ε#1 and ε#2) were
assayed for expression of key apoptosis-related genes. A) For qPCR, RNA was isolated
using the QIAGEN RNeasy kit and reverse transcribed to cDNA using random hexamers
and the TaqMan Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR assays
were performed in a 7300 ABI PCR System (Applied Biosystems), using TaqMan Gene
expression assays and TaqMan Universal master mix. Human 18S rRNA was used as an
endogenous control for normalization. The relative levels of mRNA compared to control
were calculated according to the ΔCt method. B) Western blots and the corresponding
densitometric analyses were carried out essentially as previously described (Oliva et al.,
2008). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Bik, anti-Bak, anti-caspase 3, anticIAP2, anti-Bcl2, anti-Bcl-XL (Cell Signaling, 1:1000 dilution), and anti-β-actin (Sigma,
1:50,000 dilution). Densitometric analysis of 3 independent experiments is shown. Data are
expressed as the mean ± S.E.M. (n=3). *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01.

Simultaneous detection of apoptosis-related genes and 2 housekeeping genes by qPCR was carried out using RT2 Profiler PCR Array plates (QIAGEN)
and a RT2 SYBR Green/5-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX) qPCR master mix. Data were normalized to GAPDH and β-actin housekeeping genes, and the
relative levels of mRNA calculated according to the ΔCt method. Genes that changed expression > 1.5-fold as a consequence of PKCε depletion were
selected for further analysis. Tumor cells, H358 cells expressing shRNA control (CTRL) or shRNA for PKCε (ε#1 and ε#2) were assayed for expression
of key apoptosis-related genes. Human samples, data publicly available from the Oncomine repository. Lung adenocarcinomas (LAC) were compared
against normal lung tissues (NL). Data for each gene were filtered for down-regulation in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) vs. normal lung
(NL) tissue with a p<0.05. Whenever possible, multiple studies containing information for each gene were compared by meta-analysis and an associated p
value was determined. p values for single-gene (Single) or meta-analysis (Meta) are shown. To establish if PKCε-regulated genes are altered in lung
cancer, we carried out a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), as previously described (Subramanian et al., 2005). A GSEA comparing LAC (n=139)
vs. NL (n=17) was run for the defined PKCε-gene set using the complete dataset for the Bhattacharjee Study (Bhattacharjee et al., 2001). Enrichment in
NL is indicated by “Yes”. ns, not significant.
