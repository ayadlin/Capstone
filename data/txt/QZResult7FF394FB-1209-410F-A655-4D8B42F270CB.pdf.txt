Abstract
The therapeutic efficacy of nucleoside analogues, e.g. gemcitabine, against
cancer cells can be augmented by inhibitors of checkpoint kinases, including Wee1,
ATR, and Chk1. We have compared the chemosensitizing effect of these inhibitors
in cells derived from pancreatic cancer, a tumor entity where gemcitabine is part of
the first-line therapeutic regimens, and in osteosarcoma-derived cells. As expected,
all three inhibitors rendered cancer cells more sensitive to gemcitabine, but Wee1
inhibition proved to be particularly efficient in this context. Investigating the reasons
for this potent sensitizing effect, we found that Wee1 inhibition or knockdown not only
blocked Wee1 activity, but also reduced the activation of ATR/Chk1 in gemcitabinetreated cells. Combination of several inhibitors revealed that Wee1 inhibition requires
Cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2 (Cdk1/2) and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) to reduce
ATR/Chk1 activity. Through activation of Cdks and Plk1, Wee1 inhibition reduces
Claspin and CtIP levels, explaining the impairment in ATR/Chk1 activity. Taken
together, these results confer a consistent signaling pathway reaching from Wee1
inhibition to impaired Chk1 activity, mechanistically dissecting how Wee1 inhibitors
not only dysregulate cell cycle progression, but also enhance replicative stress and
chemosensitivity towards nucleoside analogues.

Introduction

kinases. This notion initiated the design of small
molecules that target and inhibit this class of enzymes
[7]. Checkpoint kinases have emerged as therapeutically
important targets, as their inhibition can sensitize cancer
cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics. In a majority
of cancer cells, the G1/S checkpoint is impaired; as
a consequence, these cells rely on intra S and G2/M
checkpoints for DNA repair and survival [8]. Known
players involved in the intra S and G2/M checkpoints
include ATR, Chk1, and Wee1. Thus, combining inhibitors
of these kinases with gemcitabine can sensitize tumor
cells, including pancreatic, colon and breast tumors [9, 10,
11]. Gemcitabine leads to replicative stress and activates
the intra S-phase checkpoint which, in turn, counteracts
the damage to DNA. Therefore, inhibitors of checkpoint
kinases enhance replicative stress, DNA damage, and
tumor cell death. However, there is a lack of quantitative
comparisons between the efficacy of inhibiting different
checkpoint kinases to sensitize cells towards gemcitabine.
Moreover, it remains to be determined how Wee1 and

Gemcitabine (2’, 2’-difluorodeoxycytidine, dFdC),
an analogue of deoxycytidine, is active against a broad
spectrum of solid tumors, mostly pancreatic cancer [1],
but also breast cancer [2], bladder cancer [3] or non-small
cell lung cancer [4]. Pancreatic cancer is the eighth leading
cause of cancer-related deaths [5]. Currently, gemcitabine
is the principal compound used for its treatment, and it
improves survival in a fraction of patients; however, the
tumor response rate to gemcitabine monotherapy is only
5.4% [1], and the median progression-free survival under
such therapy is 3.5 months [6]. Thus, in nearly all cases,
pancreatic cancers display either primary or secondary
resistance towards gemcitabine. This raises the need to
identify strategies for improving the chemosensitivity of
pancreatic cancer cells.

ATR/Chk1 activities affect each other in gemcitabinetreated cells.
In our study, we found that Wee1 inhibition is
particularly potent to eliminate gemcitabine-treated cancer
cells, as compared to the inhibition of Chk1 or ATR.
Importantly, inhibition of Wee1 in gemcitabine-treated
cells hampered the ATR/Chk1 pathway, thus resulting
in the impairment of at least three kinases that would
otherwise attenuate replicative stress. Inhibition of Cyclindependent kinases (Cdks) along with Wee1 rescued the
ATR/Chk1 activity, thus identifying Cdks as mediators of
ATR/Chk1 inactivation in this system. Furthermore, we
observed that increased activity of Cdks upon inhibition
of Wee1 caused activation of Polo-like kinase1 (Plk1).
Plk1, in turn, led to the reduction of Claspin and CtIP
levels, thereby attenuating the ATR/Chk1 pathway. These
findings thus identify a cross-talk between Wee1 and ATR/
Chk1 activities and a role of Wee1 in sustaining ATR/
Chk1 activation during replicative stress.

combining the Wee1 inhibitor with gemcitabine leads to
more pronounced cell death in comparison to single drug
treatment (Supplemental Figure 1D-1F).
In parallel, we determined the phosphorylation of
(the histone variant) H2AX, an established marker of DNA
damage response, directly after treatment with the drugs
for 24 h. We used quantitative immunofluorescence to
measure the amount of phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX).
We found that the inhibition of each of the three kinases
cooperates with gemcitabine in potentiating the DNA
damage signal as determined by increased average γH2AX
intensity (Figure 1E, 1F). To rule out that the appearance
of γH2AX is a result of apoptosis [14] rather than the
direct consequence of DNA damage, we performed
similar experiments in the presence of Z-VAD.fmk, a
pan caspase inhibitor that prevents apoptosis. However,
caspase inhibition did not interfere with the accumulation
of γH2AX in this context (Supplemental Figure 1G).
Wee1 inhibition increased γH2AX levels even on its
own (Figure 1E, 1F) and it also proved to impair survival
to a particularly large extent (Figure 1A-1D). In contrast,
we observed only a mild cooperative effect on γH2AX
accumulation when combining the inhibitor of Chk1 with
Wee1 inhibition (Fig.1G, 1H). This observation held true
even in the presence of Z-VAD.fmk (Supplemental Figure
1H). This raised the question whether the Wee1-dependent
signaling pathways might be epistatic to the ATR/Chk1
pathway, or vice-versa.

Results
Inhibitors of Chk1, Wee1 or ATR sensitize tumorderived cells towards gemcitabine
For
comparative
assessment
of
their
chemosensitizing activities, we evaluated pharmacological
inhibitors against Chk1, Wee1 and ATR (SB 218078,
MK-1775,and VE-821 respectively). The efficiency of
these inhibitors was confirmed through immunoblot
staining of their respective substrates (Supplemental
Figure 1A, 1B). Earlier studies performed using these
inhibitors have shown sensitization of tumor cells towards
various chemotherapeutics [9, 11, 12, 13], here, we were
aiming at the direct comparison of the cytotoxic effects
of these inhibitors in combination with gemcitabine.
We investigated the long-term effect of the combined
treatment by monitoring the growth of the cells over 1-2
weeks after treatment. Panc1 (pancreatic adenocarcinoma)
and U2OS (osteocarcinoma) cells were treated with the
inhibitors in the presence or absence of gemcitabine for
24 h. After removal of all the drugs, the growth of the
cells was followed using bright field microscopy and
automated image analysis (Celigo cytometer) for 8-13
days. The length of the experiments was chosen as to
allow control-treated cells to reach confluence. We
observed that combining inhibitors of either Wee1 or
ATR with gemcitabine retards the growth of the cells to
a higher extent than the Chk1 inhibitor in both Panc1
and U2OS cells (Figure 1A-1D). Similarly, MiaPaCa2
(pancreatic adenocarcinoma) cells were found to be
sensitized towards gemcitabine upon inhibition of
Wee1 or ATR (Supplemental Figure 1C). Furthermore,
cell viability assays in these cell lines revealed that

Wee1 inhibition attenuates Chk1 phosphorylation
in gemcitabine-treated cells
To analyze the signaling pathways involved in the
DNA damage response upon Wee1 inhibition, we detected
DNA damage signaling intermediates through immunoblot
analysis. Cells were treated with the Wee1 inhibitor and/
or gemcitabine for 24 h, followed by detection of DNA
damage response factors (Figure 2A, 2B). The activity of
the inhibitor was verified by detecting the phosphorylation
of Cdk1 at Tyr15, a known Wee1 phosphorylation site
[15]. As expected, this phosphorylation was decreased
upon treatment with the Wee1 inhibitor (Figure 2A,
2B). Next, we determined the activity of the ATR-Chk1
signaling pathway upon Wee1 inhibition. Phosphorylation
of Chk1 at Ser317 is mediated by ATR and activates Chk1
[16]. Strikingly, we observed that Chk1 phosphorylation
(Ser317) decreased upon Wee1 inhibition in gemcitabinetreated cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that an impact of Wee1 on Chk1 activation is reported.
γH2AX intensity did not decrease by Wee1 inhibition.
This experiment was also performed after removing
Wee1 using two distinct siRNAs, and this also reduced
the phosphorylation of Chk1 in gemcitabine-treated
U2OS and Panc1 cells (Figure 2C and Supplemental
Figure 2A). This decreased activation of Chk1 was

independent of the p53 status of the cells, since both
U2OS (p53 wild type) and Panc1 (p53 mutant; R273H)
[17] cells showed reduced phospho-Chk1 upon Wee1
inhibition. To further rule out a role of p53, we knocked

down p53 in U2OS cells and treated them with Wee1
inhibitor, with or without gemcitabine. Eliminating p53
led to somewhat higher levels of total Chk1, in agreement
with the notion that Chk1 is negatively regulated by p53

[18]. Chk1 phosphorylation was induced by gemcitabine,
regardless of the p53-knockdown. Importantly, however,
the phosphorylation of Chk1 was still reduced when
gemcitabine-treated cells were additionally incubated
with a Wee1 inhibitor, regardless of the p53 knockdown
(Figure 2D). We conclude that the inhibition or removal
of Wee1 hampers the Chk1 signaling pathway and leads to
diminished activation of Chk1 in cells that are undergoing
replicative stress.
PARP cleavage was increased when Wee1 inhibition
was combined with gemcitabine, indicating caspase
activity in these cells (Figure 2A-2D). To exclude that
apoptosis may lead to a loss in the phosphorylation of
Chk1, e.g. by general removal of phosphate groups from
proteins [19] or PP2A-mediated Chk1 dephosphorylation
[20, 21], we performed the treatment of the cells with
gemcitabine and/or Wee1 inhibitor in the presence of
Z-VAD.fmk. Analysis of the blots showed that the loss
of Chk1 phosphorylation by Wee1 inhibition occurred

independent of caspase activation (Figure 2E, 2F). Thus,
active caspases are not required for this impairment of the
ATR/Chk1 signaling axis.

Wee1 is required for sustained ATR-Rad17
signaling in gemcitabine-treated cells
Besides Chk1, we also detected the phosphorylation
of another ATR substrate, Rad17 (Ser645) [22] as a
function of Wee1 activity. We performed quantitative
immunofluorescence analysis of the phosphorylation
of Rad17 upon combining the inhibition of checkpoint
kinases with gemcitabine. Panc1 and U2OS cells were
treated with the 1µM Wee1 inhibitor and gemcitabine for
24 h, followed by analysis of phospho-Rad17 staining
intensity. The inhibition/ removal of Wee1 sharply
decreased phospho-Rad17 accumulation in gemcitabinetreated cells (Figure 3A, 3B and Supplemental Figure 2B,
2C).

were treated with 1µM Wee1i or DMSO in the presence or absence of 300nM gemcitabine for 24 h. Cells were then fixed and stained

(Input, C), and after ATR IP D. The Immunoglobulin G heavy chain (IgG-H) of the precipitating antibody was detected by the secondary
IB antibody and shown as a loading control.

To address whether Wee1 inhibition leads to the
inactivation of ATR, we detected ATR phosphorylation
at Thr-1989; phosphorylation of this site has earlier
been described as a marker of ATR activity [23]. Upon
treatment of cells with Wee1 inhibitor and/or gemcitabine,
ATR was immunoprecipitated to concentrate this
protein and then immunoblotted to detect phospho-

ATR (Thr1989). Phospho-ATR levels, as expected,
were increased upon gemcitabine treatment, but when
gemcitabine was combined with the Wee1 inhibitor, the
levels of ATR phosphorylation were reduced (Figure 3C,
3D), suggesting impaired activity of ATR. These results
suggest that Wee1 activity sustains the activation of ATR
pathway upon induction of DNA damage by gemcitabine.

Wee1 inhibition impairs ATR-Chk1 signaling
activity through Cyclin-dependent kinases

also restored Chk1 phosphorylation upon simultaneous
knock down of Wee1 in the presence of gemcitabine
(Supplemental Figure 2D, 2E). In conclusion, Cdk1
is specifically required for inactivating the ATR-Chk1
pathway upon Wee1 inhibition.
Functional inactivation of the Retinoblastoma
protein (also referred as pRb) has been found to be
controlled by distinct Cyclin-cdk complexes, namely
Cyclin D-Cdk4/6, Cyclin E-Cdk2 and Cyclin A-Cdk2/1
[27]. As Cdks negatively regulate pRb, we tested whether
pRb might be involved in maintaining the activation of
the ATR signaling pathway, e.g. through E2F-mediated
transcription of ATR and/or its signaling intermediates.
However, the mRNA levels of ATR did not significantly
change upon knockdown of Wee1 (Supplemental Figure
2F). Moreover, we analyzed the effects of Wee1 inhibition
in Hela cells that contain the E7 protein from human
papilloma virus 18, which can bind and inactivate pRb
[28]. We treated this cell line with Cdk inhibitor, Wee1
inhibitor, and gemcitabine, alone or in combinations. We
observed that even in Hela cells, Cdk inhibition could
rescue the phosphorylation of Chk1 (Supplemental Figure
2G). This suggests that Wee1 inhibition interferes with
ATR/Chk1 activity through Cdk1, but independently of
pRb.

Wee1 directly phosphorylates and inhibits Cdk1
and Cdk2 at the conserved Tyr15 residue [24]. Thus,
Wee1 inhibition can lead to Cdk1/2 activation. To test
whether the impairment of the ATR-Chk1 pathway by
Wee1 inhibition is due to Cdk activation, we inhibited
Cdks using Roscovitine, along with Wee1 inhibition and
gemcitabine exposure. Western blot analysis showed
rescue of decreased Chk1 as well as ATR phosphorylation
when Cdks were inhibited in gemcitabine-treated cells,
despite the presence of Wee1 inhibitor (Figure 4A-4C).
These findings imply that the inactivation of the ATR/
Chk1 pathway is mediated through Cdks upon Wee1
inhibition.
Roscovitine is a potent inhibitor of Cdks and binds
competitively to the ATP binding domain of these kinases
[25]. To further specify the Cdk(s) involved, we used a
selective inhibitor of Cdk1, RO-3306. This inhibitor
has nearly 10-fold selectivity for Cdk1, as compared to
Cdk2 [26]. We found that RO-3306, when combined
with Wee1 inhibition and gemcitabine, could restore
the phosphorylation of Chk1 (Figure 4D). In line with
these observations, the removal of Cdk1 by siRNAs

treated with combinations of Wee1i, gemcitabine, and the Plk1 inhibitor, GSK 461364 (referred to as Plk1i) at 100nM for 24 h, followed
by immunoblot analysis. C, D. Panc1 and U2OS cells were treated with Wee1i, Plk1i, and/or Roscovitine, in the presence of gemcitabine at
the indicated concentrations for 8 h. Immunoblots were stained for phosphorylation of Plk1 (Thr210), an indicator of Plk1 activity.

Polo-like kinase 1 impedes the Chk1 activation in
response to Wee1 inhibition

Wee1 inhibition diminishes levels of CtIP in a
Cdk-dependent manner, and this hampers ATR
activation upon replicative stress

The yeast homolog of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1),
cdc5, is activated by the Cdk1 homolog, cdc28, in budding
yeast [29, 30]. On the other hand, Plk1 is known to downregulate the ATR/Chk1 pathway at different levels. Plk1
phosphorylates Claspin and marks it for degradation by
SCFbetaTrCP, thereby restraining Chk1 activation [31]
[32]. Furthermore, Plk1 interferes with CtIP activity [33].
To investigate the role of Plk1 in the negative regulation
of ATR/Chk1 activity, we incubated cells with a Plk1
inhibitor (GSK 461364) or siRNA against Plk1, in the
presence of the Wee1 inhibitor and gemcitabine; through
immunoblot analysis, it was found that the inhibition or
removal of Plk1 could recover the phosphorylation of
Chk1 (Figure 5A, 5B and Supplemental Figure 2H, 2I).
Hence, Plk1 activity is required for the attenuation of
ATR/Chk1 signaling upon Wee1 inhibition.
To validate the activation of Plk1 upon Wee1
inhibition, and its dependence on Cdks, we performed
western blot analysis to detect the phosphorylation
of Plk1 at Thr210, a hallmark of Plk1 activation [34].
Phosphorylated Plk1 (Thr210) increased with Wee1
inhibition, but this phosphorylation vanished when
inhibitors of Plk1 or Cdks were added (Figure 5C, 5D).
We conclude that Plk1 activity is increased upon Wee1
inhibition in the presence of gemcitabine, and that this
activation is a necessity for impeding the ATR/Chk1
pathway.

The CtIP protein can act as a cofactor in ATR
activation [35]. On the other hand, at least in budding
yeast, CtIP has been found regulated by Plk1 [33],
suggesting that Plk1 may govern ATR activity through
CtIP. To test this, we determined the levels of CtIP
upon Wee1 inhibition in the presence of gemcitabine.
Indeed, CtIP levels decreased when Wee1 was
inhibited in gemcitabine-treated cells. This was found
by immunofluorescence (Figure 7A, 7B) as well as
immunoblot analysis (Figure 7C, 7D). The decrease in
CtIP levels could be rescued by simultaneous inhibition
of Cdks through Roscovitine (Figure 7C, 7D), suggesting
a role of Cdks in the reduction of CtIP levels. We further
tested if removal of CtIP was sufficient to attenuate ATR
activation in this context. Knockdown of CtIP using
siRNAs in the presence of gemcitabine decreased ATR
activation (Figure 7E). Thus, CtIP is indeed required to
maintain the activity of ATR. In conclusion, the decrease
in CtIP in response to Wee1 inactivation contributes to the
impairment of ATR activity.

Plk1 activation and Claspin/CtIP reduction
precede the inactivation of ATR/Chk1 upon Wee1
inhibition
In order to understand the chronological order of the
events regulating ATR/Chk1 activity, we treated Panc1 and
U2OS cells with the Wee1 inhibitor and/or gemcitabine
and harvested at different time points for immunoblot
analysis. We observed that inhibition of Wee1 in
gemcitabine-treated cells initially activated Plk1, reduced
Claspin levels and altered the electrophoretic mobility of
CtIP (compatible with a posttranslational modification).
At a later time, the phosphorylations of ATR and Chk1
were reduced (Figure 8A; cf. Figure 2A and 2B, for 24
h treatment results). This sequence of phosphorylation
events is compatible with a model depicted in Figure 8B,
reaching from Wee1 inhibition through Cdk and Plk1
activation to a reduction in the activating phosphorylations
of ATR and Chk1.

Upon Wee1 inhibition, Plk1 mediates inactivation
of Chk1 through reduction in the levels of Claspin
protein
Next, we investigated whether Wee1 inhibition
diminishes Chk1 activity by altering levels of Claspin,
a cofactor of Chk1 activation. We determined the levels
of Claspin while inhibiting Wee1 as well as Plk1 or
Cdks. Indeed, Claspin levels were decreased upon Wee1
inhibition in the presence of gemcitabine, but the original
amount of Claspin was restored when inhibitors of Plk1
or Cdks were added (Figure 6A, 6B). We further observed
that the decrease in the protein levels of Claspin was due
to proteasomal degradation, since exposure to MG132 (a
proteasome inhibitor) could reinstate the normal amount of
this protein (Supplemental Figure 3A). At the same time,
mRNA levels of Claspin did not change significantly upon
Wee1 inhibition (Supplemental Figure 3B, 3C). Moreover,
the siRNA-mediated removal of Claspin reduced Chk1
phosphorylation as well (Figure 6C, 6D). The knockdown
efficiency of siRNAs was determined using immunoblot
analysis (Supplemental Figure 3D). Thus, the reduction of
Claspin occurs through Cdks and Plk1, and it contributes
to the attenuation of Chk1 activity upon Wee1 inhibition.

Discussion
The Wee1 inhibitor, MK-1775, sensitizes tumor
cells towards gemcitabine with particular efficiency, even
when compared to inhibitors of ATR and Chk1. MK-1775
increased H2AX phosphorylation and markedly reduced
long-term survival of the cells. Mechanistic analyses then
revealed that Wee1 signaling is epistatic in relation to
ATR/Chk1 activity in gemcitabine-treated cells.

Thus, we observed attenuation of the ATR/
Chk1 pathway upon Wee1 inhibition. This provides an
attractive explanation for the observed increase in the
DNA damage response when combining gemcitabine
with a Wee1 inhibitor. ATR and Chk1 activity, at least
in general, attenuate replicative stress [36]. Therefore, if
Wee1 inhibition impairs ATR/Chk1 activity, the expected
consequence is that replicative stress is enhanced,
especially in the presence of a false-incorporated
nucleoside analogue. In the absence of sufficient ATR/

Chk1 activity, DNA replication forks tend to stall and
eventually collapse [34, 37]. In such a scenario, the
intermediates of incomplete DNA replication trigger a
DNA damage response, e.g. through activation of ATM
and/or DNA-PK. As a result, phosphorylated H2AX
accumulates and cell survival is impaired. We therefore
propose that attenuated ATR/Chk1 represents at least one
of the reasons why Wee1 inhibitors can synergize with a
number of chemotherapeutics to trigger cancer cell death
[38].

that Wee1 inhibition impairs ATR-Chk1 signaling, as suggested by the results of our study. Inhibition of Wee1 activates Cdks, which in turn
increases the activity of Plk1. Plk1 destabilizes Claspin and thereby impairs Chk1 activity. Cdks also mediate a reduction in CtIP levels,
thus attenuating ATR activation and further contributing to the loss in Chk1 activation.

number of studies still found cooperative effects when
using inhibitors of Chk1 and Wee1 simultaneously for
cancer treatment [22, 45]. We propose that the reason
for this cooperativity might consist in the timing of
the enzymatic activities. For optimum sensitization, it
may be advantageous to block Chk1 immediately when
cells are exposed to nucleoside analogues. In any case,
however, our observations suggest that Chk1 and ATR
are eventually attenuated by Wee1-inhibitors alone in the
context of gemcitabine treatment.
Wee1 inhibitors represent promising anti-cancer
drug candidates [11, 46] and are currently being tested
in clinical trials of phases I and II (NCI Clinical Trials).
Our results strongly suggest that Wee1 inhibition
eliminates cancer cells not only by premature activation
of chromosome separation [13] but also by enhancing
replicative stress through impairment of ATR/Chk1
signaling. This unique combination of cytotoxic
mechanisms, triggered through a single target, provides
an attractive explanation for the remarkable cytotoxic
efficacy of Wee1 inhibitors.

Regulation of Wee1 by Chk1 has been studied,
revealing that Chk1 phosphorylates Wee1 to inhibit Cdc2
phosphorylation at Tyr15 [39]. Vice versa, however, it has
hitherto not been known whether and how Wee1 supports
ATR signaling. Since Wee1 sustains Chk1 activity upon
replicative stress (our study), whereas Chk1 diminishes
Wee1 activity [39], it is tempting to speculate that a
negative feedback loop limits the activation of Chk1 by
Wee1.
Our study revealed that Cdks are required for
negatively regulating the ATR/Chk1 pathway upon Wee1
inhibition. This is conceivable since Wee1, when active,
mediates an inhibitory phosphorylation on Cdk1/2.
But how would enhanced Cdk activity attenuate ATR/
Chk1 signaling? Our results show that this is mediated
through Plk1. In human cells, Cdk1 has been reported to
‘prime’ the Plk1 substrates by phosphorylating them. The
‘primed’ substrates, e.g. Vimentin, are then recognized
and phosphorylated by Plk1 [40]. In S. cerevisiae, Cdk1
has been proposed to maintain the stability of Plk1 by
phosphorylation at Thr23 [30], but it is currently unknown
whether such a mechanism exists in the human system
as well. However, we observed that phosphorylation of
Plk1 at Thr210, a marker for its activation [34], increases
upon Wee1 inhibition in gemcitabine-treated cells. It thus
appears conceivable that Cdk activity may support Plks by
more than one mechanism, enhancing its general activity
as well as priming specific substrates. Once activated, we
propose that Plk1 attenuates ATR/Chk1 signaling. Plk1
has been implicated in the phosphorylation and subsequent
degradation of Claspin, thereby preventing the activation
of Chk1 in response to replicative stress [31, 39, 32, 40].
The removal of Claspin provides an explanation
for attenuated Chk1, but not for diminished ATR
activity upon Wee1 inhibition. In recent studies, Wee1
inhibition has been demonstrated to impair homologous
recombination [43, 44] and CtIP plays a key role in
this mode of DNA repair [45]. In agreement with these
findings, we observed that CtIP was degraded when
Wee1 was inhibited in gemcitabine-treated cells. CtIP is
phosphorylated by Cdks [46] and, at least in yeast, also
by Plk1 [33]. This phosphorylation mediates binding of
the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 to CtIP. Pin1-catalyzed
isomerization of CtIP facilitates the degradation of the
latter [47]. Moreover, Plk1 phosphorylates and stabilizes
Pin1 [47]. Therefore, we propose that upon inhibition
of Wee1, hyperactive Cdks phosphorylate CtIP, while
activated Plk1 stabilizes Pin1, which together facilitates
proteasomal degradation of CtIP. On the other hand, CtIP
is required for sustained ATR/Chk1 signaling and for
keeping up the intra-S phase checkpoint [48]. As a net
result, Wee1 inhibition attenuates the activities of ATR
and Chk1. Taken together, our analyses reveal a pathway
that leads from Wee1 inhibition to the impairment of ATR
and Chk1 in the context of replicative stress (Figure 8B).
Despite the attenuation of Chk1 by Wee1 inhibition, a

Culturing of human cancer cell lines
Panc1 (human pancreatic epithelioid carcinoma)
and U2OS (human osteosarcoma) cells were cultured
in DMEM (Gibco, Life Technologies) with 10% FCS
(Gibco, Life Technologies), 200µM L-glutamine (Gibco,
Life Technologies) and antibiotics – 50U/ml Penicillin

Transfection of cells with siRNA, and inhibitor
treatment
To knock down genes of interest, reverse
transfection was performed in 6-well plates with 10nM
siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies).
Cells were either harvested or treated with chemicals after
48 h. siRNAs to Wee1 (s21, silencer select), Claspin #1

horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch) were
used for chemiluminescent detection (Millipore).

Cell proliferation assay
To track cell proliferation, the Celigo cell cytometer
(Cyntellect, San Diego, CA, United States) was used; the
confluency of the cells was measured by transmission
microscopy. Cells were seeded in 96- well plates (5000
cells per well). After 24 h, the confluency of the cells
was measured (labeled as Day 0), followed by treatment
with 0.5µM MK-1775 / 2.5µM SB 218078 / 5µM
VE-821 without or with gemcitabine at the indicated
concentrations. After 24 h, all the drugs were removed.
Subsequent measurements of cell confluency were made
after every 24 h, and media was changed every 48 h.

Immunoprecipitation

CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay

Cells were seeded in a 10 cm petri dish (8 x 105
cells per dish). 24 h after seeding, the cells were treated
with the indicated inhibitors in the presence or absence
of gemcitabine for 24 h. Protease inhibitors (complete
(mini) inhibitor mix from Roche) and phosphatase
inhibitors (10mM NaF, 2mM Na-pyrophosphate, 1mM
Na-orthovanadate) were added to the IP-lysis buffer
(50mM Tris- HCl, pH 7.5, 300mM NaCl, 1% NP-40,
0.1% Na-deoxycholate) just before its use. Cells in IPlysis buffer were scraped off the plate and transferred to an
Eppendorf tube, followed by homogenization with a 26G
syringe, sonication and centrifugation. 2 µg of antibody
was added and incubated overnight at 4°C on a rotor. 30 µl
of equilibrated Protein G sepharose beads were put in the
lysates and incubated 1 h at 4°C. After 5 washes in 800 µl
IP-lysis buffer, 30µl of 6 X Laemmli buffer was added to
the pellet and boiled at 95°C for 5 min. The samples were
subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.
Immunoprecipitation was performed to concentrate
ATR using the anti-ATR (N-19) antibody from Santa
Cruz and then immunoblotted to determine the levels of
phospho-ATR (T1989) (Kerafast).

This assay (Promega) was performed to determine
the amount of metabolically active cells present in a
culture. It is based on the activity of luciferase, which uses
ATP from cells to generate a luminescent signal, quantified
by a DLReady™Centro LB 960 luminometer. Cells were
seeded in opaque-walled 96-well plates (3000 cells per
well) and exposed to drugs after 24h. 72 hours later, cell
lysates were prepared and luminescence was recorded.

Preparation of whole cell lysates for SDS-PAGE
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (1.6 x 105
cells per well) for the drug treatment. Cell lysates were
prepared on ice. The cells were scraped off into the
medium and pelleted by centrifugation at 1500xg for 3
min at 4°C, followed by one wash in PBS. The cells were
resuspended in 100µl RIPA lysis buffer (1% Triton X,
1% Desoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM
EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100.000KIE Aprotinin)
freshly supplemented with 2M urea, 1mg/ml leupeptine/
aprotinine, 0.1M pepstatin A, 0.1M pefabloc. After 20
min of shaking at 4°C, the lysates were centrifuged at
15,700xg for 10min. Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay
was used to normalize the concentration of proteins in the
supernatant. The samples were then boiled with Laemmli
buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE.

Immunofluorescence analysis
For immunofluorescence microscopy, the automated
microscope Pathway 855 (Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, United States) was used to read fluorescence
intensity in 96-well plates. For confocal microscopy, LSM
510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) was
used.
The cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for
20 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.5% triton-X
in PBS for 15 min and blocking for 15 min using blocking
solution (3% BSA in PBS). The primary antibody to
phospho-H2AX (05-636, Millipore)/ phospho-Rad17
(6981, Cell Signaling Technology)/ CtIP (61142, Active
Motif), diluted in blocking solution, was added for 1 h,
