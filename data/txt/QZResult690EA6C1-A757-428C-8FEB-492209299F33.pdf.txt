Abstract
Cisplatin is an antineoplastic drug, mostly documented to cause cell death through the formation of DNA
adducts. In patients, it exhibits a range of short-term side effects that are unlikely to be related to its genomic
action. As cisplatin has been shown to modify membrane properties in different cell systems, we investigated
its effects on mechanosensitive ion transporters and channels. We show here that cisplatin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the mechanosensitive Na+/H+ exchanger NHE-1, with a half-inhibition concentration of
30 μg/mL associated with a decrease in Vmax and Hill coefficient. We also showed that it blocks the Cl− and
K+ mechanosensitive channels VSORC and TREK-1 at similar concentrations. In contrast, the nonmechanosensitive Cl− and K+ channels CFTR and TASK-1 and the Na+-coupled glucose transport, which share functional
features with VSORC, TREK-1, and NHE-1, respectively, were insensitive to cisplatin. We next investigated
whether cisplatin action was due to a direct effect on membrane or to cortical actin remodeling that would affect
mechanosensors. Using scanning electron microscopy, in vivo actin labeling, and atomic force microscopy, we
did not observe any modification of the Young's modulus and actin cytoskeleton for up to 60 and 120 μg/mL
cisplatin, whereas these concentrations modified membrane morphology. Our results reveal a novel mechanism
for cisplatin, which affects mechanosensitive channels and transporters involved in cell fate programs and/or
expressed in mechanosensitive organs in which cisplatin elicits strong secondary effects, such as the inner ear or
the peripheral nervous system. These results might constitute a common denominator to previously unrelated
effects of this drug. Cancer Res; 70(19); 7514–22. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Cisplatin is an antineoplastic drug used in the treatment of
ovary, testes, kidney, or head and neck solid tumors (1). Understanding its mechanisms of action is crucial for the design
of adjunctive treatments that prevent resistance and help patients to better tolerate chemotherapy. Cisplatin forms DNA
purine-purine adducts (2) that trap proteins of the highmobility group. These complexes block the enzymatic maAuthors' Affiliations: 1Université de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Transport

chinery that acts on DNA and activate pathways that signal
genome damage, ultimately leading to cell death (see ref. 3
for review). However, this mechanism cannot explain all
the actions of this drug. First, in patients, cisplatin elicits a
range of short-term secondary effects that include disturbance of the hydroelectrolytic balance, gastrointestinal troubles, hearing alterations, imbalance, and modified perceptions
or sensations. Second, in cellular models, cisplatin acts on microtubules (4) and actin polymerization (5) and can modify or
interact with phospholipids (6, 7). Other studies including genetic screens for cisplatin resistance have documented that
membrane proteins (8), enzymes involved in lipid synthesis
and modification (9), or cellular enzymes (10) are affected by
this drug. In this context, we previously reported that cisplatin
increases membrane fluidity and activates the acid sphingomyelinase (11, 12). This enzyme converts sphingomyelin to ceramide that plays a key role in the response to a wide range of
proapoptotic signals. Because modifications of membrane composition and fluidity directly change its mechanical properties,
we decided to investigate whether clinical concentrations of cisplatin (13) could affect the function of mechanosensitive transmembrane channels and transporters. In parallel, we also tested
transporters and channels bearing common features with the
previous ones while being insensitive to membrane tension.

Cisplatin Blocks Mechanosensitive Transporters and Channels

We show here that the mechanosensitive Na+/H+ exchanger
NHE-1 (14–16), K+ channel TREK-1 (17, 18), and outwardly rectifying chloride channel VSORC (19, 20) are all inhibited by cisplatin. In contrast, the nonmechanosensitive glucose transporter,
the background K+ channel TASK-1 (21), and the Cl− channel
CFTR are not inhibited. These results may provide new clues for
understanding important secondary effects of cisplatin.

Data were compiled using Microsoft Excel software and
fitted using the SigmaPlot 2001 program (Jandel). Unless otherwise stated, the experimental points correspond to the
compilation of at least five independent experiments, with
each experimental point determined at least in duplicate. Error bars are SE. Constants obtained from fitting data are provided with the error of the fits and r2 goodness-of-fit factors.

Cell cultures
Fibroblasts from the PS120 cell line expressing either wildtype (WT) NHE-1 or the R327E mutant were grown as described
(22). COS cells were grown as described (17). DCT kidney cells
were cultured on collagen-coated Petri dishes as described (23).

[3H]DOG transport
Cells plated on six-well plates were depleted in glucose for
30 minutes and incubated for the last 10 minutes in the same
medium containing 60 μg/mL cisplatin. Initial rates of deoxyglucose uptake were then measured at room temperature (10 μCi/
mmol, 0.1 mmol/L). Uptake was stopped using four rapid
rinses in ice-cold PBS. Cells were then solubilized in 0.1 mol/L
NaOH, and radioactivity was counted using scintillation.

Measurement of initial rates of NHE-1
Cells seeded on 24-well plates were acidified as described
(22). Measurements were performed by 1-minute incubation
in the uptake medium at room temperature (22) supplemented with 3 mmol/L LiCl instead of 22Na+, followed by four
rapid rinses in ice-cold PBS. Cells were solubilized in 1 N nitric acid (trace metal grade, Fisher Scientific), and Li+ was
measured using atomic absorption spectrometry (Zeeman
furnace system, Solaar 969, Thermo Optek). NHE-1 initial
rates were calculated as the cariporide (10 μmol/L)–sensitive
Li+ accumulation per well divided by protein quantities.
Apart from the experiments presented in Fig. 1A, cisplatin
was added for 10 minutes before uptake and maintained
throughout the measurements.

Electrophysiologic studies
Whole-cell currents recorded at room temperature (24)
were sampled at 2.5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. For the Cl−
channels (VSOR and CFTR) and for the K+ channel (TASK-2),
the cells were held at −50 mV, and 400-ms pulses varying from
−100 to +100 mV were applied in 20-mV increments. For the K+
channel studies (TREK-1), a single ramp varying from −100 to
+100 mV in 400 ms was imposed to the clamped cells according
to Maingret and colleagues (25). Cl− current recordings were
performed using a pipette solution containing 145 mmol/L
NMDGCl, 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mmol/L MgATP, and
5 mmol/L EGTA (Pos = 290 mOsm/kg H2O). The hypertonic
bath solution contained 140 mmol/L NMDGCl, 10 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mmol/L MgATP, 5 mmol/L EGTA, and

bath solution was obtained by removing mannitol from the
previous NMDGCl bath solution.
To study K+ conductances, pipette and bath compositions
were designed to record only K+ ions movements at positive potentials. The pipette solution contained 140 mmol/L K-gluconate,
10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L
CaCl 2 (free calcium concentration of 10 nmol/L), and

3-nm gold-palladium and observed with a Jeol 6400F scanning electron microscope.
Atomic force microscopy
Micromechanical experiments were conducted with an
atomic force microscopy (AFM; Nanowizard I, JPK Instruments) mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope
(Zeiss Axiovert 200; refs. 26–30). Measurements were performed on cells seeded on 24-mm glass coverslips in a heating
observation chamber (Biocell, JPK Instruments), which allowed us to carry on the experiment at 25.0 ± 0.1°C. Bright-field
contrast imaging was used to select cells, position the cantilever, and monitor cell morphology during measurements. The
AFM head was equipped with a 15-μm z-range linearized piezoelectric ceramic scanner used in closed height feedback
mode (28) and an IR laser. The sensitivity of the optical lever
system and cantilever spring constant was calibrated in situ

using built-in routines of the JPK (31). The calibration procedure for each cantilever was repeated up to three times. Spring
constants were consistent with the manufacturer's nominal
value (10 pN/nm, MSCT/MSNL, Veeco Instruments). The
speed for inserting or removing the tip from the cell surface
was set to 1 μm/s and the desired contact force to 1 nN.
One thousand and twenty-four points per second were used
over a travel distance of 4 μm. The contact time was set to 0
to minimize potential dissipation contributions. At least 10
successive force curves were obtained from each cell. Each resulting curve was examined and processed using the JPK-IP
batch processing procedures (JPK Instruments): correcting
for baseline shift and/or tilt for the pushing part of the force
curve, finding the contact point between the tip and the cell,
calculating the tip sample separation distance, and fitting the
pressing part of the force curve with a Hertz model for a
square-based pyramid (31, 32). We then extracted the value
of the Young's modulus (E) for each measurement. E values
for each cell were pooled to calculate average values that
were pooled to gain the distribution of E for each condition.
We chose to plot our data as whisker plots because the
median is a good estimator of the central tendency of the
observed (non-Gaussian) distributions of E modulus. Significance tests were run using nonparametric analysis followed
by Dunn tests using Prism (GraphPad Software).

Results
Cisplatin and Na+-coupled transport
Inhibition of the Na + /H + exchanger NHE-1 is dose
dependent and reversible. Figure 1A shows kinetics of inhibition of NHE-1 activity by increasing doses of cisplatin, measured using initial rates of Li+ uptake (see ref. 22, Materials
and Methods, and Supplementary Materials and Methods).
Cisplatin inhibition was dose and time dependent, reached
its maximal level after 5 minutes (Fig. 1A), and then remained
constant. The half-inhibition was estimated as ∼30 μg/mL by
plotting the dose-dependent inhibition after 10-minute treatment (Fig. 1A and B). Higher doses of cisplatin did not significantly further decrease NHE-1 activity (Fig. 1B). In hypertonic
conditions (500 mOsm/L), the half-maximal inhibition was
shifted to lower doses of cisplatin (Fig. 1B, inset).
Because cisplatin can form stable molecular complexes,
we next investigated the reversibility of this inhibition. Fibroblasts were preincubated for 10 minutes with 60 μg/mL cisplatin and then changed to cisplatin-free medium for various
durations before measurements. As shown in Fig. 1C, the effect is reversible over a few minutes, consistent with the observation that inhibition stops to increase shortly after
cisplatin addition (Fig. 1A). The curve fitted with a triple exponential, suggesting complex on and off mechanisms.

To verify that this inhibition was not due to a nonspecific
effect that would have affected Na+-coupled transporters at
large, we next tested the effect of 60 μg/mL cisplatin on glucose transport in the same fibroblasts. Initial rates of [3H]
DOG (10 μCi/mmol, 0.1 mmol/L) were compared in the presence or absence of 60 μg/mL cisplatin. Figure 1D shows that
initial rates of DOG transport measured at 2 and 4 minutes
are not affected by 60 μg/mL cisplatin.
Inhibition of NHE-1 is noncompetitive with extracellular
cations. We next tested the effect of cisplatin on NHE-1 interaction with its extracellular coupling cations. We measured initial rates of exchange at different extracellular Li+
concentrations (see Materials and Methods) on the WT
NHE-1 with or without 30 μg/mL cisplatin (Fig. 2A). The
dose-response curves fitted with Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
Cisplatin did not yield significant changes in the Km values
for extracellular Li+ (12.2 ± 0.2 and 12.5 ± 0.5 mmol/L Li+
for 0 and 30 μg/mL cisplatin, respectively) but triggered
a significant decrease in V max values (270 ± 7 to 142 ±
15 nmol/L.min−1.mg of proteins−1) for Li+. This shows that
cisplatin works as a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect
to extracellular cations.
Cisplatin and cooperative regulation of NHE-1 by
intracellular pH. Figure 2B shows the effect of 30 μg/mL cisplatin on the dose-response curves of NHE-1 for various
clamped intracellular H + values, as described by Lacroix
and colleagues (22). Because H+ interacts cooperatively with
NHE-1, we fitted these curves with equations corresponding
to different possible types of inhibition for a cooperative
mechanism: (a) a decrease in the Vmax of the exchanger with
no change in cooperativity, (b) a decrease in Hill coefficient
with a similar Vmax, and (c) a change in the microscopic affinities for protons. All yielded equally good fits (Rsq > 0.9).
To discriminate between these mechanisms, we measured
cisplatin inhibition on the Michaelian R327E mutant (22)
based on the rationale that any mechanism affecting only cooperativity would not affect this mutant, whereas any mechanism affecting either Vmax or proton binding would also
inhibit this mutant. As shown in Fig. 2C, cisplatin decreases
its Vmax measured at 3 mmol/L extracellular Li+ (59 ± 4 to 37 ±
4 nmol/L.min−1.mg of proteins−1) but does not modify its Km
for intracellular protons (Km = 8 × 10−6 ± 0.5 × 10−6 mol/L to
7 × 10−6 ± 0.8 × 10−6 mol/L; Rsq > 0.97).
Based on these results, we fitted our data for WT NHE-1
with a decreased Vmax. Interestingly, this fit also yielded a
slight decrease in cooperativity, with the following constants:
Vmax = 55 ± 9 nmol/L.min−1.mg of proteins−1 and nH = 1.3 ±
0.4 (Rsq = 0.96) in the absence of cisplatin and Vmax = 29 ±
5 nmol/L.min−1.mg of proteins−1 and nH = 1.1 ± 0.4 (Rsq = 0.92)
in the presence of 30 μg/mL cisplatin.

currents with a cord conductance (between +60 and +100 mV)

of 0.6 ± 0.3 nS. Exposure to a hypotonic bath solution (260 mOsm/L)
induced a Cl− current that exhibited kinetic and biophysical
profiles of VSORC (24). Cisplatin was then perfused and current amplitudes were recorded after 2 minutes. Figure 3A
shows the corresponding I/V curves recorded in control condition (triangles) after 10 minutes of hypotonic solution exposure (circles) and after addition of 30 μg/mL cisplatin to the
hypotonic solution (squares). The maximal conductance, 8.9 ±
2.7 nS (n = 9), decreased to 4.2 ± 2.3 nS in the presence of
30 μg/mL cisplatin. The dose dependency of inhibition of VSORC
was then analyzed in paired experiments (n = 4–9) at +100 mV
for 7.5 to 120 μg/mL cisplatin (Fig. 3B). This inhibition was
rapidly reversible and was also observed in the NHE-1–
deficient PS120 cells, ruling out an indirect effect in which
cisplatin inhibition of VSORC would be caused from that of
NHE-1 (data not shown).
We next examined the effect of cisplatin on the mechanosensitive 2P domain K+ channel TREK-1 (18), transiently
transfected in COS cells (pIRES CD8 vectors, Fugene HD, Promega). Two days after transfection, cells decorated with
anti–CD8-coated beads as described by Poet and colleagues
(33) were patched, together with several undecorated cells as
control. TREK-1–expressing cells exhibited a dramatic increase of the spontaneous conductance (41 ± 12 nS, n = 8,
calculated between +50 and +100 mV) compared with nontransfected cells (8.6 ± 0.6 nS, n = 9) and a shift of the reversal

potential to negative value as expected for K + ions. Addition of cisplatin to the bath solution induced a dosedependent inhibition of the TREK-1–mediated K+ currents
(Fig. 3D). Cisplatin (30 μg/mL) remained without effect on
the K+ current recorded in nontransfected cells (Fig. 3C).
Here, also, cisplatin inhibition was fully rinsable (data not
shown).
Effect of cisplatin on nonmechanosensitive Cl − and K +
channels CFTR and TASK-1. The effect of cisplatin was then
tested in whole-cell experiments on the CFTR Cl− conductance expressed in DCT cell line (19). The spontaneous
Cl− conductance, 3.5 ± 0.4 nS, increased to 6.6 ± 0.6 nS after
forskolin addition (10 μmol/L, n = 4; Fig. 4A and B). The
forskolin-activated I/V relationship exhibited a linear profile
typical for CFTR and was completely inhibited by the specific
inhibitor CFTRinh-172 (5 μmol/L; refs. 34, 35). Addition of cisplatin (60 μg/mL) remained without effect on the forskolinstimulated current (n = 4; Fig. 4A and B).
Cisplatin was next tested on the background 2P channel
TASK-1 transfected in COS cells as above. The CD8-decorated
cells exhibited a spontaneous cord conductance of 16 ± 2 nS
(calculated between +60 and +100 mV, n = 4) that was inhibited by acidification of the bath solution to pH 6, a hallmark
typical for TASK-1. In sharp contrast, TASK-1 currents were
not significantly modified by cisplatin (60 μg/mL, conductance of 18 ± 3 nS; Fig. 4C).

Effect of cisplatin on cell shape, actin, and
micromechanical properties
Electron microscopy. Figure 5A shows fibroblasts observed in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in control
conditions and following 10 minutes of exposure with 60 cisplatin (Fig. 5B). At 60 μg/mL, cisplatin produced changes in
the membrane morphologic features with the appearance of
noticeable villosities and long protrusions. These observations, which show a clear modification of membrane shape
by cisplatin, were repeated four times with similar results
using different batches of cells and cisplatin.
Atomic force microscopy. We next used AFM to measure
the Young's modulus of live cells in control conditions and in
the presence of 60 μg/mL cisplatin for 10 to 15 minutes. Cells
were followed individually, and 10 to 20 pressure curves were
recorded before and during the application of cisplatin (see
Materials and Methods and Supplementary Materials and
Methods). Figure 5C shows that cisplatin application does
not significantly change the cell Young's modulus even for
long times (Fig. 5C). These results are consistent with an absence of actin remodeling. This is confirmed by in vivo actin
live imaging (pEGFP-Lifeact plasmid) as shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 (see Supplementary Results).

Discussion
In this study, we show that cisplatin is an inhibitor of the
Na+/H+ exchanger NHE-1, the K+ channel TREK-1, and the
Cl− channel VSORC. These three membrane proteins are unrelated in terms of function, structure, ion selectivity, and
pharmacologic profiles but share a common feature that is
their mechanosensitivity. Despite their biochemical differences, the half-inhibition concentrations of cisplatin were
similar for these three channels and transporters, which all
exhibited noncanonical dose-response curves. These results
point out a common mechanism of inhibition related to
membrane tension rather than to protein-ligand interaction.
In the same cells and in the same conditions, we could not
detect any inhibitory effects of cisplatin on the Na+-coupled
glucose transporter, TASK-1, endogenous K+ channels, and
the CFTR chloride channel that were chosen here because
they share biochemical features with those above mentioned,
but are not mechanosensitive.
We next decided to investigate in detail the mode of inhibition of one of these targets, the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE-1.
This transporter constitutes an excellent readout for dissecting complex inhibition mechanisms because a large set of
kinetic experiments can be performed on cell populations expressing WT or various mutant exchangers. In contrast with
classic NHE-1 inhibitors, cisplatin is not competitive with extracellular cations, does not modify the affinity of the transporter for intracellular protons nor its quantity at the plasma
membrane, but decreases its maximal rate and Hill coefficient for intracellular protons. Consistent with the above results, cisplatin inhibition is increased by hypertonic shocks
that modify membrane shape and tension.
Cortical actin cystoskeleton is a crucial component of
membrane mechanical properties and is connected to

mechanosensitive channels and transporters, such as NHE-1
or TREK-1, through their ERM-binding domains (36, 37).
In addition, several reports correlated cisplatin effects with
actin modifications, but in other cellular systems and for
longer treatments than those required for this work (5, 38).
Hence, an important question was whether the inhibition of
mechanosensitive proteins was caused by a direct effect on
membrane or by cortical actin remodeling that would indirectly modify membrane tension or by both. To answer this
question, we used a set of different techniques that enabled
us to explore possible effects of cisplatin on membrane morphology, cortical actin cytoskeleton, and cell elasticity. Using
SEM, we observed that cisplatin provoked the appearance of
spikes and villosities, whose number and size increased in a
dose-dependent manner. Such structures can be due to direct constraints of the lipid bilayer (see ref. 16 for example)
or can also be an early effect of actin depolymerization (39).
We next used the Lifeact technique to perform live imaging
of actin (40), rather than classic labeling techniques on fixed
cell populations, to follow in real time actin evolution on individual cells during cisplatin treatment. For concentrations
of 60 and 120 μg/mL of cisplatin, we could not detect any
significant change in the actin fibers, or at the edges of the
cells, over the time scales used for our measurements (Supplementary Fig. S3). In parallel, we measured cell elasticity
using AFM based on the fact that any detectable change in
the cell Young's modulus would constitute a direct and quantitative readout of cortical actin modification (39). Here, also,
using phase-contrast microscopy, we could follow individual
cells before and during cisplatin treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Both at 60 and 120 μg/mL, and from 15 to 90 minutes of incubation, we could not detect any significant
changes in the cell Young's modulus from pressure curve
measurements (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S4). Taken together, the results obtained by three totally independent
and complementary techniques (SEM, actin labeling, and
AFM) did not provide any significant evidence that the inhibition of mechanosensitive channels and transporters is due
to an effect of cisplatin on cortical actin. Consistently, we
could observe with AFM that tube formation on cantilever
retraction was occurring more frequently after cisplatin
treatment (data not shown), also pointing to a direct effect
on the bilayer (26).
As is the case with many efficient drugs, cisplatin exhibits
pleiotropic effects that clearly emphasize its action on multiple macromolecular complexes. In this context, our finding
that otherwise-unrelated mechanosensitive channels and
transporters are affected by this anticancer drug might
provide new mechanisms and new targets to explore. First,
proteins, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE-1, have been
shown to be key players in cell life/death decision processes
that are crucial in the response to toxic agents and in the
efficiency of antineoplastic drugs (see ref. 41 for review). Second, from the results presented here, we can expect that organs that express mechanosensitive proteins to accomplish
their functions will be acutely and/or chronically affected by
cisplatin. Indeed, there is a large body of examples in which
cisplatin elicits rapid effects on its perfusion, which can

eventually be associated with longer-term organ toxicity during treatment. For example, after cisplatin administration, imbalance, tinnitus, and hearing problems associated with
longer-term ototoxicity are frequently reported. Obviously,
both outer and inner ear rely on mechanosensitive complexes
whose components remain to be fully identified. In this
context, it is clear that the presence of the cisplatin-inhibited
mechanosensitive TREK-1 K+ channels in the peripheral vestibular system (42) might provide an important clue to these
peculiar secondary effects. Indeed, these channels are crucial
for the control of endolymph composition and have also been
shown to exert neuroprotective effects through their hyperpolarizing action. As well, in patients and in animal models,
cisplatin and the related molecules trigger allodynia and cold
hypersensitivity (43). This led to the recent study of their
transcriptional effects on members of the transient receptor
potential (TRP) channels (44) in neurons. Interestingly, Noel
and colleagues (45) have recently reported that background
mechanosensitive K+ channels such as TREK-1, which are coexpressed with TRPs, determine the resting potential in sensitive neurons and therefore the threshold for temperature and
pain sensation. The inhibition of these K+ channels by cisplatin might be an area worthy of investigation to understand

these side effects, which can be painful enough to interrupt
the antineoplastic treatment in patients.
