BACKGROUND: The rate of hyponatremia is higher in hospitalized cancer patients than in hospitalized patients without cancer and is
associated with poor clinical outcomes. The availability of V2 receptor antagonists has been a major breakthrough in the management
of hyponatremia, but its efficacy and safety in treating hyponatremia in patients with cancer is not known. METHODS: Adult patients
with cancer who were admitted to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with nonhypovolemic hyponatremia (125-130
mmol/L) were randomized to receive either tolvaptan or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive, randomized trial.
Both groups received the standard of care for hyponatremia, except that patients were allowed to drink to thirst. RESULTS: A preplanned Data Safety Monitoring Board analysis of 30 of 48 randomized patients who completed the study revealed that the primary
endpoint of hyponatremia correction was met by 16 of 17 patients who received tolvaptan and by 1 of 13 patients who received placebo (94% vs 8%; P <.001), which met the study stopping rule for superiority. The secondary endpoints between the tolvaptan and
placebo groups (mean 6 standard deviation) for length of stay (21 6 15 days vs 26 6 15 days, respectively) and change in the MiniMental State Examination score (20.35 6 1.66 vs 0.31 6 2.42, respectively) were not significantly different. No overcorrection of serum
sodium (>12 mmol/L per day) was noted in the tolvaptan group, and the main adverse events noted were dry mouth, polydipsia, and
polyuria, leading to 13% study withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: Although tolvaptan was effective for correcting hyponatremia in patients
with cancer, studies with a larger sample size will be required to confirm the current findings, including the outcomes of secondary

INTRODUCTION
Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients, and its incidence is higher in those hospitalized patients who have cancer (nearly 1 in 2).1-3 Hyponatremia, compared with eunatremia, in hospitalized cancer patients
is associated with higher mortality rates, longer hospital stays, and higher hospital bills.3 In patients with cancer, the arginine vasopressin (AVP) hormone, especially the ectopic type, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hyponatremia.4,5 The binding of AVP to its V2 receptors on the basolateral side of the collecting tubules leads to the insertion of
aquaporin-2 on the apical side, promoting water reabsorption. The results from trials to determine whether V2-receptor
antagonism can correct hyponatremia support the role of the AVP-V2 receptor interaction in clinical settings of hyponatremia.6,7 However, very few patients with cancer were included in those trials.6,7 This is of concern, because the standard
of care of severe fluid restriction is impractical in cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy or undergoing stem cell
transplantation. Of also of concern is the safety and biocompatibility of V2 receptor antagonists in patients with cancer
who receive several medications. Moreover, hyponatremia in patients with cancer can be associated with mental status
alterations and poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy
of tolvaptan—a relatively new and orally active nonpeptide antagonist of V2 receptors—for correcting hyponatremia
in cancer patients along with the secondary objectives of assessing the effect of tolvaptan on mental status and length of
hospital stay.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study approved by the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center, Houston, Texas (MD Anderson) was a doubleblind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of 14 days’ duration
that was conducted between May 2011 and July 2012 at
MD Anderson. The IRB requires a 30-day follow-up for all
clinical studies. We collected serum sodium values when
available on day 30. The primary objective was to compare
the rate of tolvaptan-treated correction of hyponatremia
with that of placebo on day 14. Both the tolvaptan group
the placebo group received the standard of care for hyponatremia except that drinking water to thirst was allowed.
Adverse events were prospectively monitored and recorded.
The secondary objectives were to compare the length of
hospital stay and the change in mental test scores between
the tolvaptan-treated and placebo groups. For study design,
we chose the Bayesian adaptive randomization for its several reported useful features.8 This was a registered clinical
trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01199198; randomized placebo-controlled trial of tolvaptan in hyponatremic
patients with cancer).
Our analysis revealed that, with a minimum of 30
patients and a maximum of 120 patients, the operating
characteristics yielded desirable properties when assuming
a serum sodium correction rate of 25% (from published
data6) in the control arm. For example, simulations
revealed that, if the true serum sodium correction rate was
25% in the control arm and 65% in the tolvaptan arm,
then the power to detect the superiority of tolvaptan
would be 93% if all 120 planned patients were treated (see
Supporting Table 1). The study was designed in 2 phases.
In the run-in phase, patients would be randomly assigned
at a 1:1 ratio to each arm until 30 evaluable patients completed the study. At that point, the first interim assessment
would be conducted by the study statistician for the MD
Anderson Data Safety Monitoring Board. If the probability that the correction rate, for example, in the tolvaptan
arm, was greater than the rate in the control arm, given
data that are > 0.975, then the trial would stop, and the
tolvaptan arm would be selected as superior. Similarly, a
futility rule, if the data favored placebo, also was in place.
Once the efficacy data on first 30 evaluable patients
became available, the adaptive phase of the study would
start, in which more patients would be assigned to the arm
that exhibited a higher rate of meeting the primary endpoint of serum sodium correction by day 14.

(Supporting Table 2); and details on the implementation
of the protocol are provided in the supporting materials
for the web-only section. Briefly, adult patients with cancer who were admitted to MD Anderson and met the eligibility criteria for nonhypovolemic hyponatremia (125
to 130 mmol/L serum sodium) were recruited. One of the
inclusion criteria was that patients had to have an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status from 0 (fully active) to 3 (capable of only limited selfcare and confined to bed or chair 50% of waking
hours).9 The main exclusion criteria were correctable hyponatremia, admission to the critical care unit, the presence of renal failure (a glomerular filtration rate < 25 mL
per minute), and receiving strong cytochrome P450 3A4
(CYP3A4) modulators. Once a patient was recruited,
baseline measurements were taken. The Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE), a simplified and validated
test instrument used to assess for dementia, was administered by the research coordinator to score cognitive function at the beginning (before study drug administration)
and at the end (day 14) of the study.10,11 The score was
obtained at baseline for all 48 randomized patients and
for all 30 patients who completed the study.
Otsuka America Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Rockville,
Md) provided tolvaptan in 15-mg strength along with
matching placebo tablets. All study patients received the
standard of care for hyponatremia, which included fluid
restriction to 1.5 L and, if indicated, salt tablets, diuretics,
or a combination. To reduce the potential risk of sodium
overcorrection, “drink-to-thirst” was allowed. The study
tablet was titrated up to a maximum of 4 tablets (60 mg)
to obtain a serum sodium correction of 6 to 12 mmol/L
per day, targeting for a sodium level 136 mmol/L. The
dose was continued for 14 days to maintain serum sodium
levels between 136 and147 mmol/L. On day 14, baseline
measurements were repeated, and the serum sodium level
on day 14 was entered into the MD Anderson Clinical
Trial Conduct website. The patients and investigators
were kept blinded to treatment assignment. Adverse
events were monitored and recorded to assess the clinical
safety of tolvaptan. Version 3.0 of Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) was used to grade
the severity of adverse events (a grade 3 in the range
from 0 to 5 was considered severe).
Sodium was measured using the VITROS method
(VITROS Chemistry and Immunodiagnostic Products;
Ortho Clinical Diagnostic, Inc., Raritan, NJ). The intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation for sodium
were 0.5 mEq/L and 0.7 mEq/L, respectively. The principal investigator (PI) was solely responsible for the study

data analysis, and article preparation. The funding agency
played no role in these activities. The PI assumes responsibility for the content and integrity of the study, and all
authors attest to the accuracy and completeness of the
reported data. The data are available for analysis.
Statistical Analysis

Demographics were tabulated using descriptive statistics
and were compared using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the t test or the Mann-Whitney U test
for continuous variables. A 2-tailed P value  .05 was considered statistically significant. The proportions of
patients who achieved the primary endpoints on day 14 in
each group were compared. The mean serum sodium levels between the placebo and tolvaptan groups were compared at 4 time points (baseline, day 7, day 14, and day
45) using an analysis of variance along with post hoc Bonferroni correction for 4 pairwise comparisons; for these
analyses, only P values < .0125 were considered significant. To address the issue of patients who dropped out of
the study, the following sensitivity analyses (for details,
see the supporting materials in the web-only section) were
undertaken: 1) using the overall hypernatremia correction
rate for evaluable patients to impute response for those
746

who dropped out; 2) reanalyzing data from patients in the
placebo arm who did not complete the trial by using a
what-if scenario, which assumed that the patients who
dropped out had completed the trial and were responders;
and 3) using a model-based approach to impute hyponatremia correction for dropouts based on baseline
patient characteristics (ECOG performance status, age,
baseline serum sodium level, and body weight) and
observed responses in the evaluable patients.12
Deaths that occurred during the 14-day study period
and the 30-day follow-up period (45 days from the start
of the study) were recorded, and the proportion of
patients who died was compared between the 2 groups
using the Fisher exact test. Statistical analyses of the study
were undertaken independently and were verified by 2
authors (A.K.S. and S.P.) who used the statistical software
programs SPSS 19 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill) and SAS 9.3
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

who completed the study. ECOG performance status did
not differ statistically between the tolvaptan and placebo
groups, but the mean age was significantly younger in the
placebo group (Table 1). The baseline demographic and
clinical characteristic for all patients were compared
between those randomized to placebo (N 5 24) and to
tolvaptan (N 5 24) (see Supporting Table 3). All variables
were comparable between the groups except for ECOG
performance status. The placebo group included significantly more patients with higher ECOG scores than the
tolvaptan group. In Supporting Table 4, the baseline characteristics of patients who did not complete the study
(N 5 18) are compared with the characteristics of those
who completed the study (N 5 30). None of the variables

provides data comparing patients in the placebo group
with patients in the tolvaptan group who did not complete the study. None of the variables differed between the
groups, except that there were significantly more patients
with higher ECOG scores in the placebo group.
Compliance With Study Medication and
Cointerventions With Other Drugs

All patients received the allocated treatment. There were
no protocol changes without prior IRB approval. Noncompliance with protocol was limited to 20% of patients
not returning the medications. Medication compliance
was similar in both groups at approximately 95%. The
use of salt tablets and diuretics did not differ significantly,
although fewer patients who received tolvaptan had
received salt and diuretic treatment (Table 2). Specifically,
the use of furosemide was 61% in the placebo group and
53% in the tolvaptan group. The average daily dose of furosemide was approximately 40 mg daily per patient in
both groups. Thirty percent of patients in each group already were receiving furosemide at the start of the study,
and furosemide was initiated in an additional 30% of
patients in the placebo group and in an additional 29% of
patients in the tolvaptan group during the study.

Comparison of Groups for Primary Outcome

During the first planned Data Safety Monitoring Board
meeting, data on 30 patients who completed the study
(13 in the placebo group and 17 in the tolvaptan group)
were analyzed. Most baseline characteristics of patients in
the 2 groups were comparable (Table 1). Sixteen of 17
patients in the tolvaptan group and 1 of 13 patients in the
placebo group achieved the primary endpoint of serum
sodium correction on day 14 (94% vs 8%, respectively;
P < .001). Thus, the study met the predefined stopping
rule of superiority for tolvaptan over placebo; and, according to IRB instructions, further patient recruitment was
halted. Figure 2 displays serum sodium levels at Day 0,
Day 7, Day 14 and Day 45 in the two groups. Figure 3
shows that most of the increase in serum sodium occurred
in the first few days of starting tolvaptan: the level
increased slowly and significantly in the tolvaptan group
from day 0 to day 14, but it decreased to placebo levels after tolvaptan was discontinued. In the placebo group, the
mean serum sodium level increased slightly by day 7 (Fig.
3). By day 7, 11 of 17 patients in the tolvaptan group
(65%) and 1 of 13 patients in the placebo group (8%)
achieved eunatremia. The absolute change in serum sodium levels (6 standard deviation) over 14 days was

3.92 6 2.53 mmol/L in the placebo group (P < .001).
Table 2 provides key measurements taken during the
14 days of the study in patients who completed the study.
The increase in the serum osmolality level, as in the serum
sodium level, was significantly higher in the tolvaptan group
than in the placebo group (Table 2). Urine output on day 3
was higher and the length of hospital stay was shorter in the
tolvaptan group, but neither difference reached statistical
significance. Changes in bodyweight, hematocrit, serum bilirubin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, creatinine, and blood glucose during the 14 days were not
significantly different between the groups (Table 2).
Comparison of Groups for Secondary Outcomes

The secondary endpoints between the tolvaptan and placebo groups (mean 6 standard deviation) for length of stay
(21 6 15 days vs 26 6 15 days, respectively) and changes
in the MMSE score (20.35 6 1.66 vs 0.31 6 2.42, respectively) were not significantly different (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analysis

By using the overall hypernatremia correction rate (17 of
30 patients; 56.6%) of evaluable patients to impute
response for the patients who dropped out, there
remained a statistically significant treatment effect
(P < .001). Four more patients in the placebo arm did not
complete the trial; thus, using a what-if scenario, we reanalyzed the primary endpoint assuming that these patients
had been responders. A significantly high rate of serum sodium correction still was noted in the tolvaptan group

(P < .001). Similarly, when we used a model-based
approach to impute hypernatremia correction for dropouts using baseline patient characteristics (ECOG performance status, age, baseline serum sodium level, and
body weight) and the observed responses in the evaluable
patients, a statistically significant treatment effect
remained (P 5 .001). More details of the sensitivity analyses and results are presented in the web-only section.
Safety

The common adverse events unique to the tolvaptan
group were dry mouth (21%), thirst (46%), and increased
urination (frequency and volume; 13%) (see Supporting
Table 6). Thirteen percent of patients who were receiving
tolvaptan and who had these symptoms at grade 2 or 3
CTCAE levels withdrew from the study. The common
(5%) adverse events were pain (of any type), nausea,
vomiting, edema, and infections (of any type). The serious
adverse events (CTCAE grade 3) were pneumonia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and worsening of edema.
The frequencies of these serious adverse events were not
increased in the tolvaptan group (see Supporting Table
6), and there were no significant differences in 45-day
mortality between the 2 groups (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
This controlled trial demonstrated that 14 days of tolvaptan
therapy achieved a 94% rate of hyponatremia correction
749

Original Article

compared with an 8% rate in the placebo arm while both
groups were receiving the standard of care. The mental state
and the length of hospital stay did not differ significantly
between the groups. The short-term use of tolvaptan was
not associated with any increased adverse events other than
dry mouth, polyuria, and polydipsia.
For this study, we chose to use the adaptive randomization approach rather than the frequentist randomization approach, because the former could have allowed us
to use observed results in preceding patients to base
assignment probabilities. However, early termination of
the study based on the first preplanned Data Safety Monitoring Board analysis obviated the need for the adaptive
phase of randomization. Despite stopping early, our analyses, including the intention-to-treat analysis, suggested
the superiority of tolvaptan over placebo in correcting hyponatremia in cancer patients. The correction afforded by
the commonly used clinical strategies of modest fluid
restriction, salt tablets, and/or diuretics was incomplete
(see Figs. 2 and 3). The correction in the tolvaptan group
was evident from the first day of its use; the majority of
patients achieved eunatremia by day 7, and nearly all
achieved eunatremia by day 14. No patients experienced
an overcorrection of hyponatremia in this study.
Although the study was initiated in the hospital to watch
for overcorrection, our data suggested (but do not demonstrate) that tolvaptan could be initiated safely in outpatients, especially if it was started at a lower dose of 7.5 mg
and if patients were allowed to drink to thirst.
The cyp3A4 enzyme system, which is responsible for
metabolizing tolvaptan, also handles other drugs, including anticancer drugs.13 Although, in the current study, we
excluded patients who were receiving strong cyp3A4 compounds, such as azoles, for potential safety concerns, most
patients were receiving multiple drugs, and nearly half
were receiving chemotherapeutic drugs. Although we did
not have any clinical or laboratory evidence of potential
interactions between tolvaptan and other drugs or of toxicity from such interactions, it is prudent to continue to
look for possible interactions. Tolvaptan was associated
with a higher incidence of hyperglycemia in 1 study6 and
with elevations of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels in another study.14 The US Food
and Drug Administration has determined that the drug
tolvaptan should not be taken for longer than 30 days and
should not be used in patients who have underlying liver
disease. Our study was of shorter duration and used lower
doses compared with other studies. Therefore, we could

An important issue that we had addressed in this
study was the occurrence of missing data in our dropout
participants. In an intention-to-treat analysis approach,
we imputed the missing data in 1 of the sensitivity analyses, yet we still observed that tolvaptan was effective in
correcting serum sodium. In our study, the ECOG score
was higher in the placebo group than in the tolvaptan
group, possibly explaining the higher dropout rate in the
placebo group. However, we observed that tolvaptan was
still efficacious after adjusting for ECOG values in the
model-based sensitivity analysis.
Despite the fluid allowance for patients to drink-tothirst in this study, the serum sodium level in patients who
received tolvaptan was corrected and remained corrected
until the end of the study in all but 1 patient (who had a serum sodium level of 135 mmol/L on day 14). We chose
not to use improvement of symptoms, such as headache
and nausea, as an outcome measurement, because these
symptoms can be nonspecific in patients with cancer who
are receiving chemotherapy. Instead, we sequentially measured any changes in cognitive function by using a questionnaire that had been validated primarily in patients with
dementia. No significant change was observed before or after tolvaptan. Most of our patients had chronic hyponatremia, probably allowing neurocognitive adaptation. The
duration of hospital stay in the patients who received tolvaptan also was not significantly lower, possibly because
none of our patients were admitted to the hospital for the
purpose of correcting of hyponatremia per se. Also, the
study was powered to test the primary endpoint of efficacy
and safety of tolvaptan in cancer patients and not the secondary endpoints. However, in the absence of a significant
difference in the 2 clinical outcomes, the actual clinical
value of the increases in serum sodium in the tolvaptantreated population is currently not clear.
The results of our study should be considered preliminary; thus, before the wider use of tolvaptan or other
expensive V2-receptor antagonists, studies with larger
sample sizes will be required to demonstrate that hyponatremia correction improves outcomes. For example, this
may require studies in symptomatic patients with significant hyponatremia or studies conducted in unique areas,
such as the emergency department, in which acute, supervised treatment of hyponatremia with tolvaptan may
reduce hospitalization for correcting hyponatremia with
substantial cost benefit. Anecdotally, moderate to severe
hyponatremia in our cancer patients has delayed cancer
treatments (chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and
surgeries) and hospital discharges and has prompted hospital admissions and critical care transfers.

Tolvaptan in Cancer Patients/Salahudeen et al

In summary, this randomized controlled trial demonstrates that tolvaptan is effective in correcting hyponatremia among patients with cancer. Main adverse effects
are thirst, polyuria, and polydipsia. In patients who have
cancer with nonhypovolemic hyponatremia of moderate
severity and do not respond to standard-of-care treatment
for hyponatremia, tolvaptan can be an effective treatment
for correcting hyponatremia.
