Abstract
ONC201/TIC10 is a small-molecule inducer of the TRAIL gene
under current investigation as a novel anticancer agent. In this
study, we identify critical molecular determinants of ONC201
sensitivity offering potential utility as pharmacodynamic or predictive response markers. By screening a library of kinase siRNAs
in combination with a subcytotoxic dose of ONC201, we identiﬁed several kinases that ablated tumor cell sensitivity, including
the MAPK pathway–inducer KSR1. Unexpectedly, KSR1 silencing
did not affect MAPK signaling in the presence or absence of
ONC201, but instead reduced expression of the antiapoptotic
proteins FLIP, Mcl-1, Bcl-2, cIAP1, cIAP2, and survivin. In parallel
to this work, we also conducted a synergy screen in which

ONC201 was combined with approved small-molecule anticancer drugs. In multiple cancer cell populations, ONC201 synergized with diverse drug classes, including the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. Notably, combining ONC201 and sorafenib led to
synergistic induction of TRAIL and its receptor DR5 along with a
potent induction of cell death. In a mouse xenograft model of
hepatocellular carcinoma, we demonstrated that ONC201 and
sorafenib cooperatively and safely triggered tumor regressions.
Overall, our results established a set of determinants for ONC201
sensitivity that may predict therapeutic response, particularly in
settings of sorafenib cotreatment to enhance anticancer responses.

Introduction

cancer patients to evaluate monoagent safety and preliminary
antitumor activity in selected solid and liquid tumors.
We previously reported genetic determinants of sensitivity to
TRAIL (2) and therapeutic strategies to increase cancer cell sensitivity to TRAIL, such as combination therapy with sorafenib (3).
Our previous studies found that ONC201-mediated apoptosis is
Bax dependent in HCT116 cells, as is the case with recombinant
TRAIL (1, 2). In this study, unbiased genetic and small-molecule
approaches to identify determinants of ONC201 sensitivity were
pursued in parallel and to augment the antitumor activity of
ONC201 through combination therapy. In addition to basic
ﬁndings that include a novel relationship that we identify between
KSR1 and regulators of apoptosis, these studies also identify
several predictive markers of ONC201 response and drug combinations that warrant investigation in future monoagent and
combinatorial clinical studies.

ONC201/TIC10 is a small molecule that was discovered due
to its ability to engage the endogenous TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) cell death pathway that triggers cell
death in tumor cells with a favorably wide therapeutic window.
We previously reported the discovery and selective advantages
of this small molecule compared with other TRAIL-based
agents, along with preclinical efﬁcacy, safety, and mechanism
of action studies. These studies revealed substantial monoagent efﬁcacy in several tumors types that appeared to be driven
by a late-stage dual inactivation of Akt and MAPK signaling to
boost downstream production of TRAIL through activation of
Foxo3a (1). ONC201 is currently in clinical trials in advanced

phosphate-buffered saline for in vivo studies. The FDA Approved
Oncology Set IV was obtained from the NCI.
siRNA kinase library screen
HCT116 p53/ cells were transfected at 20,000 cells per well in
96-well plates. Cells were transfected with the Stealth RNAi
human kinase library (Life Technologies) using RNAiMax (Life
Technologies) in Optimem (Life Technologies). Scramble and
AllStars Hs Cell Death Control siRNA (Qiagen) were used as
negative and positive controls, respectively. Transfection was
carried out overnight, and the following day complete media
containing ONC201 or DMSO were added to the plates following
removal of the transfection media. CellTiterGlo (Promega) analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions at
indicated time points.
Small-molecule synergy screen
Procedures were performed with a Biomek 2000 robot using
pin tools for drug treatment. Cells were seeded at 5  104 cells/mL
in 96-well black-wall plates, and treatment was performed 12
hours later. Combinatorial activity was initially assessed by calculating the difference between the observed activity with the
combination and the sum of the monoagent activities.
Cell-based assays
Cell viability, Western blot analysis, and cell-cycle ﬂow-cytometry analysis were performed as previously described (1). Cell
surface TRAIL and DR5 were assessed following ﬁxation with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes, rinsed in PBS, incubated
overnight at 1:200 with anti-TRAIL (Abcam) or anti-DR5 antibodies, rinsed in PBS, incubated with ﬂuorophore-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Thermo Scientiﬁc Pierce) at 1:250 for 30
minutes, and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. pERK was assessed with
an antibody for p-T202/Y204 (Cell Signaling Technology), and
pAkt was assessed with antibody for pT308 (Cell Signaling
Technology).
In vivo studies
Six-week-old athymic nude mice were obtained from Charles
River Laboratories. HepG2 cells (107) in 200 mL (1:1, PBS:
Matrigel) were injected into each rear ﬂank. Measurable tumors
were assessed 1 week later. Treatment was then initiated as
indicated. Sorafenib and ONC201 were administered as 100 mL
solutions by oral gavage. ONC201 was administered 12 hours
following sorafenib treatment. Tumor volume was assessed with
digital calipers and calculated as a spheroid. Tumor dimensions
and body weights were assessed twice a week. IHC (Vector Labs)
and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL; Millipore) analyses were performed as
previously described (1).
Statistical analysis
Pairwise comparisons were assessed by a two-tailed Student t
test. Combination indices were calculated using the Chou–Talalay method and CalcuSyn software.

Results
Identiﬁcation of kinase regulators of ONC201 sensitivity
We conducted a siRNA screen to identify kinases that affect
ONC201 response in cancer cells to potentially gain mechanistic
insight regarding ONC201 and identify molecular targets for

www.aacrjournals.org

combination therapy to improve the activity of ONC201 and/or
predict response. A siRNA library targeting 636 kinases was used
for the screen along with 1 mM dose of ONC201 in HCT116
p53/ cells. The screen identiﬁed a number of candidate positive
and negative regulators of ONC201 sensitivity at 12 and 36 hours
after treatment (Fig. 1A). As expected, there was a general trend
toward decreased cell viability with knockdown of most kinases
themselves, though the decreased cell viability was typically
modest in magnitude (<30%). The top three to four positive and
negative modulators of ONC201 sensitivity at each evaluated
time point were selected for validation studies (Supplementary
Table S1), which identiﬁed four kinases that enhance response to
ONC201 following knockdown at 36 hours after treatment in
HCT116 p53/ cells: DGKD, SGKL, STK123, and KSR1 (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Enhanced
ONC201 efﬁcacy with knockdown of these four kinases is also
apparent at 48 but not 24 hours after treatment (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the molecular mechanism of sensitivity may involve the
late apoptotic effects rather than the early signaling effects.
Network analysis of these four kinases that regulate ONC201
sensitivity and the previously described mechanism of ONC201
revealed rational overlap of signaling pathways with some
kinases. Among the four identiﬁed kinases, KSR1 possessed the
most direct connections to the putative mechanism of ONC201
that involves the dual inhibition of Akt and the MAPK pathway
(Fig. 1C). KSR1 is described as a MAPK scaffold protein that
positively regulates the MAPK signaling pathway (4). Western blot
analysis conﬁrmed knockdown of KSR1 at the protein level by
siRNA and that ONC201 has a modest negative effect on KSR1
expression as a monoagent (Fig. 1D). Cell death assays with
ONC201 and siRNA targeting KSR1 revealed that KSR1 knockdown signiﬁcantly enhanced cell death induced by ONC201
(Fig. 1E). Also in support of a MAPK-independent effect, knockdown of KSR1 did not enhance the effects of the dual EGFR/HER2
small-molecule inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We next investigated whether KSR1 knockdown affected
the amount or kinetics of TRAIL or DR5 production that is
stimulated downstream by ONC201. No effect was observed
on these parameters with knockdown of KSR1 (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Consistent with this notion, the concentration threshold
and magnitude of MAPK and Akt signaling inhibition was not
affected by KSR1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S4). These
observations suggested that the ability of KSR1 to sensitize cancer
cells to ONC201 involves factors that lie downstream of TRAIL
production.
Identiﬁcation of small molecule anticancer drugs that synergize
with ONC201
In parallel to the siRNA screen, we screened for FDA-approved
drugs that synergize with ONC201 in a panel of human cancer cell
lines that represent a diverse array of solid tumors (brain, breast,
colon, liver, lung, and ovarian) to potentially improve the antitumor activity of ONC201. For this screen, we utilized the NCI
DTP Approved Set IV that includes 101 small molecules approved
by the FDA for an indication in oncology. To enable sufﬁcient
evaluation of synergism, we chose to screen using a subcytotoxic
dose of ONC201 (1 mmol/L) and tested multiple doses of
the approved oncology drugs (10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, and
1 mmol/L), given their wide range of GI50 values among each
other and across cell lines. Using cell viability assays following
72 hours of treatment, we identiﬁed 33 approved oncology drugs

that combined with ONC201 to give a >20% reduction in cell
viability over the expected reduction in cell viability, which was
calculated as the sum of the observed monoagent activity (Fig.
2A). Twelve of these agents synergized under more than a single
condition tested in the screen (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
Analyzing the classes of drugs tested in the screen revealed that
ONC201 synergizes with a wide array of drug classes, though
synergy was not ubiquitous within any particular class (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Notable exceptions were the absence of synergy
observed with any speciﬁc mTOR or EGFR/MAPK signaling inhibitors. This observation is in accordance with previous studies of
ONC201 that demonstrated the ablation of Akt and MAPK
signaling following ONC201 monoagent treatment in HCT116

cells (1). Lack of synergy with speciﬁc antiangiogenic agents were
also noted, which is expected as angiogenesis is not represented in
standard cell culture models. Alkylating agents and nucleotide
synthesis inhibitors possessed the largest number of agents that
synergized with ONC201, though this can be attributed to the
increased prevalence of these agents among the approved smallmolecule oncology drugs (Supplementary Fig. S5C).
We selected eight approved oncology drugs for validation
based on the amount of synergy and the number of instances of
synergy observed in the screen: azacitidine, bortezomib, dacarbazine, hydroxyurea, pralatrexate, sorafenib, topotecan, and vismodegib. We evaluated the combinatorial activity of these agents
with ONC201 in multidose cell viability assays in the cell lines

where synergy was previously demonstrated (Supplementary
Fig. S6A). The combination of ONC201 with these agents generally resulted in a complete elimination of tumor cells at the
higher tested doses.
We prioritized the validation of combinations as a function of
synergistic activity as well as overall efﬁcacy (Fig. 2B). Six of the
nine validated agents met the prioritization criteria of imparting
>20% increased reduction in cell viability over the expected
observations and a >25% reduction in absolute cell viability with
the combination: azacitidine, bortezomib, dacarbazine, hydroxyurea, sorafenib, and vismodegib (Fig. 2C). Synergy between TRAIL
and bortezomib, dacarbazine, hydroxyurea, or sorafenib has been
previously reported (3, 5, 6). Examining monoagent and combinatorial activity, we found that adding vismodegib to ONC201
did not result in improved activity compared with monoagent
ONC201, but rather reversed surprising agonistic growth effects of
monoagent vismodegib that we observed in several cell lines.
Sorafenib possessed the highest number of data points in the

www.aacrjournals.org

validation dataset that met our prioritization criteria, demonstrating synergy in HCT116 and A172 cell lines at multiple doses
(Supplementary Fig. S6B).
ONC201 synergizes with sorafenib in vitro and in vivo
We next explored the activity of ONC201 alone and in combination with sorafenib in its approved indications, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. The combination of
sorafenib and ONC201 resulted in synergistic reduction of cell
viability in HepG2 cells, but not other cell lines in the panel
(Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S7 and Supplementary Table S3).
Synergy was objectively conﬁrmed by combination indices using
the Chou–Talalay method (Supplementary Table S4).
We next investigated the possibility that ONC201 and sorafenib synergistically induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells. We found
that ONC201 in combination with sorafenib cooperatively
induced cell death that was signiﬁcantly greater than either of
the monoagents (Fig. 3B). Further supporting evidence of

apoptosis was obtained by Western blot analysis of caspase-8
activation and cleavage of PARP and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3C
and Supplementary Fig. S8). Together, this evidence indicates that
ONC201 and sorafenib synergistically induce apoptosis in
HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
We then evaluated the antitumor activity of ONC201 and
sorafenib alone and in combination in HepG2 subcutaneous
xenografts in athymic nude mice. Sorafenib was administered
once a day for days 1 to 5 and days 8 to 12 at 40 mg/kg orally,
and ONC201 was administered once a week at 25 mg/kg. ONC201
and sorafenib monoagent therapies induced partial regressions of
these xenograft tumors, which do not grow aggressively in vivo, as
previously reported (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S9A). In
contrast with in vitro results, ONC201 exhibited a more potent
antitumor effect than sorafenib under these conditions. The combination produced a signiﬁcantly increased rate of complete tumor
regressions (8 of 10 tumors) compared with ONC201 (4 of 10) or

(Fig. 3E). The combination was well tolerated with no overt signs
of toxicity or loss of body weight (Supplementary Fig. S9B).
Sorafenib and KSR-1 affect ONC201 response by regulating
FLIP, IAP, and Bcl-2 proteins
We investigated the effects of ONC201 and sorafenib, alone
and in combination, on surface TRAIL and DR5 that together act
as apoptosis initiators. ONC201 consistently upregulated surface
TRAIL and DR5, as previously reported (1), and sorafenib surprisingly upregulated TRAIL in two of the three cancer cell lines.
Both surface TRAIL and DR5 were cooperatively upregulated by
the combination of sorafenib and ONC201 in HepG2 cells, an
observation that was not evident in the other tested hepatocellular
carcinoma cells that did not exhibit synergy (Fig. 4A). Cooperative
induction of TRAIL and DR5 was also observed in tumor specimens from the HepG2 in vivo experiment with sorafenib and

ONC201 (Supplementary Fig. S10). Investigating effects of combinatorial sorafenib and ONC201 therapy on Akt and ERK kinase
activity in a cellular context with respect to their mutual substrate
Foxo3a revealed a cooperative inhibitory effect on the Akt phosphorylation site of Foxo3a (Fig. 4B). The ERK phosphorylation
site of Foxo3a was eliminated by sorafenib monoagent therapy,
likely due to the direct inhibition of Raf by sorafenib.
We also investigated the effects of sorafenib on apoptosis
regulators that we previously described as modulators of TRAIL
sensitivity (3). Among IAP and Bcl-2 family members, sorafenib
downregulates expression of survivin and XIAP in HepG2 cells
(Fig. 4C). Sorafenib also negatively regulated Mcl-1, Bax, Bak,
cIAP1, and survivin to a moderate extent in HCT116 cells that
undergo apoptosis in response to ONC201 treatment (1). By
comparison, KSR1 knockdown resulted in downregulation of the
antiapoptotic proteins FLIP, Mcl-2, Bcl-2, cIAP1, cIAP2, and
survivin in HCT116 cells that was even more dramatic in most
cases than that observed with sorafenib (Fig. 4D).
Based on these regulatory relationships and previously established relationships with TRAIL sensitivity, we investigated the

www.aacrjournals.org

effects of knocking down the caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP or the Bcl-2
family protein Mcl-1 on ONC201 sensitivity in HCT116 cells (7).
We found that knockdown of either of these proteins enhanced
the response to ONC201 (Fig. 4E). In addition, we found that
these genetic manipulations also sensitized HepG2 cells to
ONC201 (Supplementary Fig. S11). Together, these results suggest that FLIP, IAP, and Bcl-2 proteins may modulate sensitivity to
ONC201 and that sensitivity to ONC201 can be increased
through regulation of these proteins by sorafenib (Supplementary
Fig. S12).

Discussion
The siRNA screen in the present studies identiﬁed several kinases
that negatively regulate ONC201 response and may be evaluated as
predictive markers in nascent clinical studies. It is worth noting that
these markers are predictive of enhanced or blunted responses to
ONC201, rather than complete presence versus complete absence
of responses. In addition to serving as biomarkers, these kinases
may be pharmacologically engaged directly or indirectly with other

therapies to potentially augment ONC201 efﬁcacy. To this effect, a
number of FDA-approved anticancer therapies were identiﬁed in
this study that combine with ONC201 to synergistically exert
antitumor effects. The combination of sorafenib and ONC201
appears to be promising, given the prevalence of cures, and it was
well tolerated in mouse models. One limitation of this study is that
hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts, including HepG2 xenografts,
are not very aggressive in mouse models, although the responses
were impressive.
Synergy between sorafenib and TRAIL has been extensively
reported in a variety of tumor types, including hepatocellular
carcinoma, with sorafenib-mediated downregulation of Mcl-1
and FLIP being the most commonly proposed mechanism of
TRAIL sensitization (3, 8–11). The mechanism of sorafenibmediated regulation of these proteins is less clear, as reports have
proposed a number of mechanisms, including inhibition of
transcription through Stat3 or NF-kB, and alternative mechanisms such as inhibition of translation. These ﬁndings suggest that
other therapies that synergize with TRAIL, such as quinacrine, are
worth investigating for combinatorial activity with ONC201 (12).
By a similar notion, these ﬁndings also suggest that sorafenib may
sensitize other TRAIL-based agents such as TRAIL-receptor agonists that have been developed, including antibody- and protein
scaffold–based approaches (13–15).
One limitation of these studies is the somewhat ambiguous
biology of KSR1, which was previously reported as a regulator of
Ras signaling. Despite selecting this lead based on this canonical
molecular biology, we did not observe effects on MAPK or Akt
signaling, but instead discovered a novel relationship between
KSR1 and regulators of apoptosis. In support of our observations,
a previous study has reported that KSR1 sensitizes endometrial
carcinoma cells to TRAIL through downregulation of FLIP that did
not involve transcription or protein degradation (16). Further
study will be needed to elucidate this mechanism of regulation
that could involve many established regulators of FLIP, IAP, and

Bcl-2 stability and expression, such as JNK (17) or NF-kB (3).
Nevertheless, the involvement of these apoptotic regulators in
ONC201 sensitizations suggests that combining ONC201 with
direct antagonists of these proteins under clinical development,
such as XIAP or Bcl-2 inhibitors, may be an effective anticancer
strategy.
