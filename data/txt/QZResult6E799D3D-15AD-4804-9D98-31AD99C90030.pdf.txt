BACKGROUND: Hand-foot syndrome and mucositis/stomatitis are frequent adverse events (AEs) of treatment with tyrosine kinase
inhibitors in cancer therapy. Quality-of-life instruments that measure the functional consequences of these AEs are needed to assess
the impact of therapeutic interventions and to guide patient care. The Hand-Foot and Mucositis Symptom and Impact Questionnaire
(HAMSIQ [formerly the Supplementary Quality of Life Questionnaire]) was used in the COMPARZ trial (Pazopanib vs Sunitinib in the
Treatment of Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma [national clinical trial no. NCT00720941]) and the PISCES
study (Patient Preference Study of Pazopanib vs Sunitinib in Advanced or Metastatic Kidney Cancer [clinicaltrials.gov NCT01064310])
to assess mouth/throat and hand/foot soreness symptoms and subsequent limitations in patients receiving pazopanib or sunitinib for
metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The objective of the current analysis was to validate the HAMSIQ using data from the PISCES study.
METHODS: The HAMSIQ was administered in the PISCES study at baseline and every 2 weeks over two 10-week periods to patients
who were receiving pazopanib or sunitinib. Data from the first 10-week period were used to assess the feasibility, validity, and responsiveness of the HAMSIQ. RESULTS: In total, 85% of 169 patients completed the HAMSIQ (excluding the item concerning days off
work). Correlations among items within the same limitation subscale generally were high (Cronbach a  .80). HAMSIQ limitation
scores differentiated patients according to their baseline performance status and severity of soreness. Small-to-moderate correlations
were observed for the symptoms/limitation scores and for changes from baseline scores between the HAMSIQ and the Functional
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy fatigue survey. The HAMSIQ demonstrated responsiveness to changes in clinical status and the
development of hand-foot syndrome AEs over time. CONCLUSIONS: The HAMSIQ is a feasible, valid, reliable, and responsive instrument for assessing the impact of hand-foot syndrome and mucositis in patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Pazopanib and sunitinib are oral angiogenesis inhibitors that are approved for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). They have demonstrated similar efficacy and also similar rates of dose reduction and
drug discontinuation as a result of adverse events (AEs) in a phase 3 study (Pazopanib vs Sunitinib in the Treatment of
Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma [COMPARZ]; clinicaltrials.gov NCT00720941).1-3 However, the safety profiles of the 2 drugs differ, and a higher incidence of AEs was associated with discomfort, such as fatigue,
hand-foot syndrome (HFS), and mouth sores, in the sunitinib arm compared with the pazopanib arm. Conversely, elevated liver enzyme levels, weight loss, and changes in hair color were more common with pazopanib treatment than with
sunitinib.
Although both treatment options exhibit similar efficacy, the differing safety profiles and, thus, the impact on
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) become important considerations when determining the choice of therapy for
patients with mRCC.4,5 This is especially true because patients often receive treatments that last for several months.

design is illustrated. EQ-5D indicates the European Quality of Life (EuroQoL) Group 5-domain quality-of-life survey; FACIT, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy; PBO, placebo; RCC, renal cell carcinoma; SQLQ, Supplementary Quality of Life
Questionnaire.

To further explore the differences in safety profiles
between pazopanib and sunitinib, a randomized, doubleblind, crossover, phase 3B study (Pazopanib vs Sunitinib
in the Treatment of Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic
Renal Cell Carcinoma [PISCES]; clinicaltrials.gov
NCT01064310) was conducted to evaluate patient preference for continuing treatment with pazopanib versus
sunitinib in an mRCC cohort and to identify factors that
influenced a patient’s choice of therapy.6 Patients’
HRQoL was assessed as part of that study using validated
questionnaires, such as the Functional Assessment of
Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) and
the European Quality of Life (EuroQoL) Group 5domain quality-of-life (QoL) survey (EQ-5D). An additional custom HRQoL measure, the Supplementary
Quality of Life Questionnaire (SQLQ), as it was then
known, also was administered as part of the HRQoL
assessments in the PISCES study after its use in the COMPARZ study.3 The SQLQ has since been renamed the
Hand-Foot and Mucositis Severity and Impact Questionnaire (HAMSIQ) to more accurately reflect its content.
The HAMSIQ was designed to address the lack of
validated questionnaires available to assess the impact of a
specific range of toxicities related to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in mRCC, such as mucocutaneous side effects, including HFS and oral AEs like
mucositis or stomatitis.7 Although HFS and oral AEs are
not life-threatening, they may have a significant impact
on patients’ HRQoL and treatment adherence. Thus, the
purpose of the HAMSIQ is to assess the impact of HFS
and mucositis on patients by evaluating mouth/throat
soreness, hand/foot soreness, and limitations because of
soreness. The HAMSIQ was modelled on the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire, which was originally developed
for use in the palifermin clinical trials to assess the impact
of oral mucositis on pain and daily functioning in patients
undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.8 By using data collected from the PISCES study,
288

the objective of the current study was to report the feasibility, validity, and reliability of the HAMSIQ by evaluating the internal consistency of its limitation scales and
comparing outcomes assessed by the HAMSIQ instrument versus those based on validated HRQoL instruments (eg, FACIT-Fatigue) and clinical measures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

PISCES was a randomized, double-blind, crossover, phase
3B study that evaluated individual preferences for continuing treatment with pazopanib versus sunitinib in
patients with mRCC.6 The trial recruited participants
from France (n 5 62), Italy (n 5 40), the United Kingdom (n 5 37), Germany (n 5 16), and Finland (n 5 14).
Primary methods and results from that trial have been
described in detail elsewhere.6 Briefly, patients aged 18
years or older who had not received prior systemic therapy
for locally advanced renal cell carcinoma or mRCC were
randomly assigned to receive pazopanib 800 mg once
daily continuously for 10 weeks (period 1); then, they
received either a 2-week washout period followed by sunitinib 50 mg once daily (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off, and 4
weeks on) for 10 weeks (period 2) or the reverse sequence
(Fig. 1). Patients were then given a choice of treatment
continuation with either pazopanib or sunitinib at the end
of period 2. The primary endpoint, defined as the patient
preference for either drug, was assessed by questionnaire.
The secondary endpoints were HRQoL assessed by the
HAMSIQ, the FACIT-Fatigue, and the EQ-5D questionnaires. The HAMSIQ and FACIT-Fatigue questionnaires
were administered at baseline and every 2 weeks thereafter, whereas the EQ-5D was administered at baseline,
during the washout period, and at end of period 2 (Fig.
1). In the current analysis, only data collected in the first 8
weeks of period 1 were analyzed, because the size of the
sample that had complete data was larger in period 1 than
in period 2. Furthermore, a sufficiently long follow-up

period was required to allow the identification of treatment toxicities. For the purposes of validating the HAMSIQ, the randomized treatment arms were collapsed for
all analyses described.
The HAMSIQ

The HAMSIQ (Supporting Fig. 1; see online supporting
information) was developed to assess the symptoms of
HFS and mucositis/stomatitis and was designed as part of
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)
measurement system for assessing the HRQoL of patients
receiving TKIs. The HAMSIQ consists of 14 questions.
Three questions assess the degree of mouth/throat, hand,
and foot soreness. In addition, there are two 5-item activity limitation subscales attributable to mouth/throat soreness and foot soreness, respectively; mouth/throat
limitations include swallowing, drinking, eating, talking,
and sleeping; and foot limitations include standing, walking, climbing stairs, sleeping, and usual activities. A final
question asks about the patient’s ability to work. All items
are answered on Likert-type scales with scores from 0 to 3.
Scores for the 2 multi-item subscales are calculated by
summing item responses. A higher score indicates worsening in symptom severity or increased limitation in
function.
Validated Questionnaires

The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item tool that measures an
individual’s level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week.9 Higher scores indicate better
QoL and less fatigue. The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status that provides a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The
EQ-5D consists of 2 parts: the EQ-5D descriptive system
(utilities) and the EQ visual analogue scale. The EQ-5D
descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions (mobility,
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/
depression),10 and higher scores indicate better QoL.
Assessments and Statistical Analysis

The properties of the HAMSIQ assessed in this analysis
were feasibility, internal consistency reliability, knowngroups validity, convergent validity, and responsiveness.11,12 Feasibility, or the ease of administration and
processing of the HAMSIQ, was assessed by determining
how many patients completed each question at each
assessment. Compliance rates were calculated as the proportion of eligible patients who completed the question at
a particular assessment. Values of zero were imputed for
any missing limitation item (question 2 [Q2] and Q5)
Cancer

responses if the preceding symptom severity item (Q1 and
Q4) was scored zero. The proportion of eligible patients
who completed the entire HAMSIQ and completed at
least 1 item on the HAMSIQ was also calculated at each
assessment.
Internal consistency of the HAMSIQ multi-item limitation subscales (Q2 and Q5) was assessed using Cronbach a values13 (criterion, a  .7; generally, a Cronbach a
value .70 is considered acceptable for internal consistency reliability) and item-total correlations (criterion,
 .3; generally, a value .3 is considered acceptable for
summing a total score).
Known-groups validity was examined to evaluate
the ability of the HAMSIQ to discriminate between clinically distinct groups that were hypothesized to differ
according to the level of severity in HAMSIQ scores. In
this study, clinically distinct groups were defined using
the following 3 clinical anchors: 1) Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) (0 vs
1), 2) the number of metastatic sites (0 or 1 vs 2) at baseline, and 3) the severity of soreness. These variables were
chosen because they represent functional performance
and the degree of clinical status or symptom severity,
which the HAMSIQ was designed to measure, and were
also available in the collected database. Kruskal-Wallis
and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare mean HAMSIQ
scores between the defined groups within each anchor.
We expected that patients who had worse performance/
clinical status would have worse mean scores on the
HAMSIQ symptom and limitations scales. Effect sizes
(mean difference/pooled standard deviation [SD]) were
calculated for group comparisons to provide an indication
of the magnitude of these group differences. Effect size is
considered small between 0.2 and 0.5, moderate between
0.5 and 0.8, and large if 0.8.
Convergent validity was assessed by using the
FACIT-Fatigue and EQ-5D as tools to validate the
HAMSIQ. We hypothesized that the HAMSIQ symptom
and limitation scores would be associated with fatigue, as
measured by the FACIT-Fatigue, and general QoL/functioning, as measured by the EQ-5D. The associations
between the HAMSIQ scores and the FACIT-Fatigue
and EQ-5D scores were evaluated using Spearman correlations. Moderate correlations in the range from 0.3 to
0.7 were expected.
Responsiveness of the HAMSIQ was evaluated by
comparing changes in the HAMSIQ symptom and limitation scores with changes in the FACIT-Fatigue scores. Initially, changes from baseline scores were calculated for all
instruments as the follow-up assessment score minus the

baseline score. Spearman correlation coefficients were
then calculated between changes in the HAMSIQ scores
and the FACIT-Fatigue scores. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the HAMSIQ limitation scores to detect changes
in symptom severity, changes from baseline scores for
symptoms were used to define 3 independent groups of
patients (improved, worsened, or unchanged). Mean
HAMSIQ limitation change scores were then compared
between these groups. A similar comparison was made for
groups of patients defined according to the worst grade of
HFS AE experienced related to mouth/throat soreness
and hand/foot soreness limitation scores. Effect sizes and
standardized response means were calculated to aid in the
interpretation of the magnitude of the change. A basic
effect size was calculated by dividing the mean change in a
group by the standard deviation (SD) at baseline. The
standardized response mean was calculated by dividing
the mean change in a group by the SD of the change
scores.
RESULTS
Patients

In total, 169 patients were randomized in the PISCES
study, and data were available for 168 of them. Baseline
characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The feasibility
assessments demonstrated that 85% of on-study
patients completed the HAMSIQ at each assessment
(Supporting Table 1; see online supporting information),
not including results for Q6 (reporting the number of
days off work). The completion rate for Q6 was low
(range, 24%-29%), because 66% of participants did not
have a paid job. Response frequencies for individual
290

HAMSIQ items are provided in Supporting Table 2 (see
online supporting information).
INTERNAL CONSISTENCY RELIABILITY
The Cronbach a value was .80 (criterion, a  .7) for all
assessments on both mouth/throat soreness and foot soreness limitation subscales (except for baseline limitations
because of mouth/throat soreness; Cronbach a 5 .67)
(Supporting Table 3; see online supporting information).
Item-total correlations within each subdomain were all
> .4 (criterion, r  .3), except 2 items in the limitations
because of mouth/throat soreness at baseline: drinking
(a 5 .23) and sleeping (a 5 .25).
Known-Groups Validity
Association between HAMSIQ scores and baseline
characteristics (ECOG PS and the number of
metastatic sites)

HAMSIQ scores within groups defined according to
ECOG PS and the number of metastatic sites at baseline
are presented in Table 2. HAMSIQ scores clearly differed
across levels of performance/clinical status, and patients
who had worse PS and more baseline metastatic sites had
higher mean HAMSIQ symptoms and limitations scores.
Because levels of soreness were minimal at baseline before
initiating therapy, small effect sizes (range, 0.22-0.28)
were observed for symptoms scores. Moderate effect sizes
(>0.4) were observed for limitations because of mouth/
throat soreness as well as foot soreness. Small effect sizes
(range, 0.18-0.37) were observed for symptoms and limitations scores assessed according to the number of metastatic sites at baseline.

Patients who had worsened soreness reported similarly
worsened limitations because of soreness with moderateto-large effect sizes (from 1.21 to 2.24 and from 1.00 to
1.94 for limitations because of mouth/throat and foot
soreness, respectively). The association of change in the limitation score from baseline to week 8 with a change in
soreness is illustrated in Figure 2.
Responsiveness of limitation scores to the
development of HFS AEs over time

Changes in the mean HAMSIQ limitations scores from
baseline between groups defined by the worst observed
HFS AE grade were evaluated at week 8 (Table 7).
Patients who had the least severe HFS AEs reported the
smallest change in mean HAMSIQ scores from baseline
(range, 0.07-0.36). Accordingly, patients who had the
worst grade of HFS AE generally reported the greatest

DISCUSSION
The current analysis assessed the feasibility, validity, and
reliability of the HAMSIQ (formerly known as the
SQLQ) for measuring the impact of HFS and mucositis
(AEs commonly associated with TKI therapy) in patients
with mRCC. High patient compliance rates across all
assessments were reported, except for the question concerning days off work, which was expected, because
greater than 66% of participants were not currently
employed. This result suggests that the item concerning
days off work may not be useful as an endpoint in this
patient population.
Internal-consistency reliability coefficients for all
items exceeded accepted standards at all assessments, indicating that items within the subscales are sufficiently interrelated to be scored together. The observation that the
correlation for sleeping was not as strong as the other subscale items was consistent with a previous report on the
Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (on which the HAMSIQ was based).8 This result may indicate that sleep patterns could be multifactorial and are likely to be
influenced by more than just mouth/throat or foot soreness. The HAMSIQ was able to differentiate between
patients according to different baseline ECOG PS and
soreness severity, but not according to the number of metastatic sites at baseline. The HAMSIQ also demonstrated
responsiveness to change in clinical status over time, successfully differentiating patients defined by changes in
soreness scores (in terms of both mouth/throat and foot
symptoms). Similarly, the HAMSIQ was responsive to
the development of HFS AEs.

Figure 3. Changes in limitation scores on the Hand-Foot and
Mucositis Symptom and Impact Questionnaire are illustrated
from baseline to week 8 according to the worst observed
grade of hand-foot syndrome. Numbers above each bar indicate the sample size in that category.

A comparison of HAMSIQ and FACIT-Fatigue
scores demonstrated moderate correlations (as hypothesized, because the instruments measure different constructs) for limitation scores, with smaller correlations for
the symptoms scores. Similarly, moderate correlations
between changes in HAMSIQ and FACIT-Fatigue scores
from baseline were only observed for limitations because of
mouth/throat soreness (at weeks 2 and 4). This supports
the validity of the HAMSIQ, illustrating that, although it is
significantly associated with fatigue and other QoL endpoints, it also produces unique and informative data about
the specific symptoms and functional impacts associated
294

with HFS and mucositis. Correlations were low between
the HAMSIQ and EQ-5D scores at baseline; however,
comparisons of the 2 instruments at this time point w3ere
not very informative, because therapy had not been initiated, and symptoms of TKI-associated soreness would not
yet have arisen for many patients.
There were limitations to the current analysis. A standardized clinical anchor, such as an objective, clinically rated
assessment of soreness, was not been included, and several
useful anchor variables and convergent validity measures
were only available at baseline (ie, the EQ-5D questionnaire
and ECOG PS). In addition, soreness was minimal at baseline before the initiation of therapy; this low variation in
scores made baseline analyses less informative.
The current analysis was undertaken to address the
lack of a validated HRQoL instrument for measuring the
impact of some common AEs specific to TKI therapy. The
development of such an instrument is important, because a
proper understanding of the impact of these low-grade,
chronic toxicities is necessary to enable the appropriate
selection of treatment and management of AEs, hopefully
leading to improved HRQoL and treatment adherence.
This is especially relevant for maintenance-type treatments,
in which the impact of low-grade, chronic toxicities can be
quite high over the longer term. Use of the HAMSIQ for
assessing and comparing the effects of TKIs in future clinical trials will provide further external validation. In conclusion, the results of this analysis demonstrate that the
HAMSIQ is a feasible, valid, and reliable instrument that
would be suitable as an accompaniment to the FACT

measurement system (eg, the FACT-General) to assess the
